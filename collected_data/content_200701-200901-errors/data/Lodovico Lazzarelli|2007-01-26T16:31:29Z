'''Lodovico Lazzarelli''' ([[San Severino Marche]], [[February 4]][[1447]] - San Severino Marche, [[June 23]][[1500]]) was an Italian poet, philosopher, courtier and alleged magician and diviner of the early Renaissance. 

He had contact with many important thinkers of his time and above all with the preacher and hermeticist [[Giovanni da Correggio]]. Himself a follower of [[hermetism]], Lazzarelli also translated the ''[[Corpus Hermeticum]]'', a translation which follows and enlarges the hermetic texts previously translated and collected by [[Marsilio Ficino]].
