[[Image:Victoria_Cross_Medal_Ribbon_&_Bar.jpg|thumb|150px|Victoria Cross medal, ribbon, and bar.]]
The '''Victoria Cross''' ('''VC''') is the highest recognition for valour "in the face of the enemy" that can be awarded to members of the [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] armed forces of any rank in any service, and civilians under military command.

The decoration is a [[cross pattée]], 1.375 inches (35&nbsp;mm) wide, bearing a crown surmounted by a lion, and the inscription "FOR VALOUR". This was originally to have been "FOR BRAVERY", until it was changed on the recommendation of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], who thought some might erroneously consider that only the recipients of the VC were brave in battle. The decoration, suspension bar and link weigh about 0.87 [[troy ounce]]s (27&nbsp;g).

The recipient's name, rank, number and unit are engraved on the back of the suspension bar, and the date of the act for which it was awarded on the back of the cross.

The ribbon is crimson, 1.5 inches (38&nbsp;mm) wide.  The original 1856 specification for the award stated that the ribbon should be red for army recipients and blue for naval ones.  However the dark blue ribbon was abolished with the formation of the [[Royal Air Force]] on [[1 April]] [[1918]], and living recipients of the naval version were required to exchange their ribbons for red ones.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://collections.iwm.org.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.941 | title=The Victoria Cross | work=Imperial War Museum Exhibits and Firearms Collections | accessdate=2006-09-30 }}</ref>

== Historical background ==
The VC was created by Royal Warrant on [[29 January]], [[1856]], backdated to 1854 to recognise acts of valour during the [[Crimean War]]. The first award ceremony was on [[26 June]] [[1857]].

It is widely believed that all VCs are cast from the [[bronze]] [[cascabel]]s of two [[cannon]] of [[China|Chinese]] origin that were captured from the [[Russia]]ns at the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854-1855)|siege of Sevastopol]], except during the [[First World War]] when metal from guns captured from the Chinese during the [[Boxer Rebellion]] was also used. However, a 2006 book on the VC's history by historian John Glanfield calls the traditional account into question, arguing that it is impossible that the metal used for VCs made before 1914 really does come from the Sevastopol guns.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/12/28/nvc28.xml |title=Author explodes myth of the gunmetal VC |publisher=[[The Telegraph]] |date=2005-12-28 |accessdate=2007-01-30}}</ref> Also, the Sevastopol metal went missing between 1942 and 1945, when another source of metal was used to make five [[Second World War]] VCs.

The barrels of the cannon in question are stationed outside the Officers' Mess at the [[Royal Artillery Barracks]] at [[Woolwich]]. The remaining portion of the only remaining cascabel, weighing 358 oz (10 kg), is stored in a vault by 15 Regiment [[Royal Logistic Corps]] at [[Donnington, Telford]]. It can only be removed under armed guard.

It is estimated that approximately 80 to 85 more VCs could be cast from this source. A single company of jewellers, Hancocks of London, has been responsible for the production of every VC awarded since its inception.

In 1856 Queen Victoria laid a Victoria Cross beneath the foundation stone of Netley Hospital. When the hospital was demolished in 1966 the VC, known as "The Netley VC", was retrieved and is now on display in the Army Medical Services Museum, Ash, near Aldershot.  This VC is not counted in any official records.

==Awards==

A total of 1,356 Victoria Crosses have been awarded since 1856. This figure is made up of 1,352 people who have earned the VC, plus three bars (awarded to people who receive the decoration a second time), and one award in 1921 to the American [[Tomb of the Unknowns|Unknown Soldier]] of the First World War. (The British [[The Unknown Warrior|Unknown Warrior]] was reciprocally awarded the US [[Medal of Honor]].)

Originally, the VC could not be awarded posthumously, and could not be awarded to Indian or African troops (although it could be awarded to their European officers). In 1905 it was made available to be awarded posthumously. Not until the 20th century was it made available to all troops in the service of the Crown (the first Indian soldier, [[Khudadad Khan]], received it in 1914).

The largest number of VCs awarded in a single day was 24 on [[16 November]] [[1857]], at the [[Siege of Lucknow|relief of Lucknow]]. The largest number awarded in a single action was 11 at [[Rorke's Drift]] on [[22 January]] [[1879]]. The largest number of Victoria Crosses awarded in a single conflict was 634 during the [[First World War]].

Since the end of the [[Second World War]] the VC has been awarded 13 times. Four were awarded during the [[Korean War]], one in the [[Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation]] in 1965, four to Australians in the [[Vietnam War]], two during the [[Falklands War]] in 1982, one in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq War]] in 2004, and one in the [[2001-present war in Afghanistan|Afghanistan War]] in [[2006]].

Only three people have been awarded the Victoria Cross twice: [[Noel Godfrey Chavasse|Noel Chavasse]] and [[Arthur Martin-Leake]], both members of The [[Royal Army Medical Corps]], and New Zealander [[Charles Upham]]. The second award is designated by a bar worn on the suspension ribbon of the original decoration and this is thus known as a "VC and Bar". Since a small cross device is worn on the VC ribbon when worn alone, a recipient of the VC and Bar would wear two such crosses on the ribbon.

New Zealander, Flying Officer [[Lloyd Allan Trigg|Lloyd Trigg]], has the distinction of being the only serviceman ever awarded a VC on evidence solely provided by the enemy, for an action in which there were no surviving Allied witnesses. The recommendation was made by the captain of the [[Germany|German]] [[U-boat]] ''[[Unterseeboot 468|U-468]]'' sunk by Trigg's aircraft.

[[Lieutenant-Commander]] [[Gerard Broadmead Roope|Gerard Roope]] was also awarded a VC on recommendation of the enemy, the captain of the ''[[German cruiser Admiral Hipper|Admiral Hipper]]'', but there were also numerous surviving Allied witnesses to corroborate his actions.

Irishman, Surgeon General [[William George Nicholas Manley|William Manley]], remains the sole recipient of both the Victoria Cross, for his actions during the Waikato-Hauhau Maori War, New Zealand on 29 April 1864, and the [[Iron Cross]], for tending the wounded during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71.

[[Image:Victoriacrosscanadapostagestampimage.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Victoria Cross featured on a Canadian postage stamp. The stamp on the right also contains a facsimile of words handwritten by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] which read: "Approved", followed by Her Majesty´s [[Royal Sign Manual]] "Elizabeth R"]]

As the VC is awarded for acts of valour "in the face of the enemy", it has been suggested by some that the changing nature of warfare will result in fewer VCs being awarded. Only one in ten VC recipients in the 20th century is said to have survived the action for which they received the VC. Following the death of Captain [[Umrao Singh]], the last surviving [[India]]n holder of the VC, in November [[2005]] there are currently only twelve surviving holders of the VC &ndash; six British, two Australians, and four [[Gurkha|Gurkhas]] &ndash; eight of them for exploits during the Second World War.

The corresponding honour for acts of valour that do not qualify as "in the face of the enemy" is the [[George Cross]], which ranks alongside the VC.

Between [[1858]] and [[1881]], the Victoria Cross could be awarded for actions taken "under circumstances of extreme danger" not in the face of the enemy. Six such awards were made during this period - five of them for a single incident (a shipwreck off the [[Andaman Islands]] in 1867).

In recent years, several [[Commonwealth]] countries have introduced their own honours systems, separate from the [[British Honours System]]. [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and [[New Zealand]] have each introduced their own decorations for gallantry and bravery, replacing British decorations such as the [[Military Cross]] with their own awards. Most Commonwealth countries, however, still recognise some form of the VC as their highest decoration for valour.

Australia was the first Commonwealth nation to create its own VC, on [[15 January]] [[1991]]. Although it is a separate award, its appearance is identical  to its British counterpart. Canada followed suit when in 1993 Queen Elizabeth signed Letters Patent creating the Canadian VC, which is also similar to the British version, except that the legend has been changed from "FOR VALOUR" to Latin "PRO VALORE".

New Zealand was the third country to create the VC as part of its own honours system. While the New Zealand VC is technically a separate award, the decoration is identical to the British design, including being cast from the same Crimean War gunmetal as the British VC.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dpmc.govt.nz/honours/overview/gallantry.html |title=New Zealand Honours |publisher=Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet |accessdate=2007-01-30}}</ref>. As of 2006, none of these VCs has been awarded.

Awards of the Victoria Cross are always announced in the pages of the ''[[London Gazette]]''.  All ranks salute a bearer of the Victoria Cross.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.whatsthenumber.com/oz-p/victoria-cross-0.htm |title=Celebrating the Tall Poppies}}</ref>

==Victoria Cross in the 21st century==

In March 2002, it was widely reported in the media that the VC was to be awarded to an unnamed [[Regimental Sergeant-Major]] in the [[Special Air Service|SAS]] for his involvement in fighting in the [[Tora Bora]] cave complex in November 2001. There was some debate over whether he should be named but a compromise was reached that his name, and some specific details of the action, would be withheld from the official announcement in the ''London Gazette''. However, this did not happen; the VC award was never confirmed, and he and another member of the SAS, who had also been discussed as a possible VC recipient, were awarded [[Conspicuous Gallantry Cross|Conspicuous Gallantry Crosses]] in October [[2002]] instead.

In April 2004 the VC awarded to [[Sergeant]] [[Norman Cyril Jackson|Norman Jackson]], [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], in 1944, was sold at auction for £235,250.  In late [[2004]], [[Duncan Gordon Boyes]] VC and nine other recipients were publicly celebrated on posters on the [[Victoria line]] of the [[London Underground]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/gloucestershire/3991993.stm |title=Rail posters tell bravery stories |publisher=BBC News |date=2004-11-08 |accessdate=2007-01-30}}</ref> That same year, a national Victoria Cross and George Cross memorial was installed in the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] building on [[Whitehall]] in London.

On [[18 March]] [[2005]], [[Private (rank)|Private]] [[Johnson Beharry]] of the 1st Battalion, [[Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment]] became the first recipient of the VC since Sergeant [[Ian John McKay|Ian McKay]] in 1982. Beharry was cited for "valour of the highest order" during the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq War]]. 

In August 2005, [[Ernest Smith|Ernest Alvia ("Smokey") Smith]], [[Canada]]'s last surviving VC recipient, died. In November 2005, [[Umrao Singh]], the last survivor of India's 40 VC recipients, died.  On [[24 July]] [[2006]], an auction at [[Bonhams]] in [[Sydney]] of the VC awarded to [[Alfred John Shout|Captain Alfred Shout]] fetched a world record hammer price of $A1 million. Captain Alfred Shout was awarded the VC posthumously in 1915 for hand-to-hand combat at the Lone Pine trenches in [[Gallipoli]] [[Turkey]]. The buyer ([[Kerry Stokes]]) has indicated that it will be displayed at the Australian War Memorial with the eight other VCs awarded to Australians at Gallipoli.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Gallipoli-VC-medal-sets-auction-record/2006/07/24/1153593264537.html |title=Gallipoli VC medal sets auction record |publisher=[[The Age]] |date=2006-07-24 |accessdate=2007-01-30}}</ref>

On [[14 December]] [[2006]] the [[Ministry of Defence|MoD]] announced the award of a posthumous VC to [[Corporal]] [[Bryan Budd]] of  [[the Parachute Regiment|3PARA]], for two separate acts of "inspirational leadership and the greatest valour" which led to his death, during actions against the [[Taliban]] in [[Afghanistan]] in July and August 2006.<ref>[http://www.gnn.gov.uk/Content/Detail.asp?ReleaseID=250538&NewsAreaID=2 Operational Honours: VC and GC for acts of exceptional valour] MOD press release, [[14 December]] [[2006]].</ref>

== Annuity ==
Holders of the Victoria Cross or George Cross are entitled to an [[annuity]], the amount of which is determined by the awarding government. Since 2002, the annuity paid by the British government is [[Pound sterling|£]]1,495 per year. As at January 2005, under the ''Canadian Gallantry Awards Order'', members of the [[Canadian Forces]], or people who joined the British forces before [[31 March]] [[1949]] while domiciled in Canada or Newfoundland, receive [[Canadian dollar|$]]3,000 per year. The Australian Government provides the two surviving Australian recipients a Victoria Cross Allowance under Subsection 103.4 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986.<ref>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/vea1986261/ </ref> In January 2006 the amount was [[Australian dollar|$A]]3,230 per year which is indexed annually in line with Australian Consumer Price Index increases.

== Forfeited VCs ==
Until the 1920s, the rules relating to the Victoria Cross allowed for the expulsion of a VC recipient from the list of people receiving the honour, and the forfeiture of their pension, if they committed "discreditable acts". The rules have since been changed to prevent such expulsions, and the eight men who lost their VCs were restored to official lists. This change in policy was insisted upon by King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] and reflected the increasing difficulty in attaining the award. He commented that, should a VC recipient later in his life be convicted for a capital crime, that individual should still be permitted to wear the decoration on the gallows. See the category [[:Category:Victoria Cross forfeitures|Victoria Cross forfeitures]].

== Theft of the VC ==
Given the rarity of the Victoria Cross and the fact they are rarely sold, these decorations are highly prized on the [[black market]].<ref>[http://www.victoriacross.org.uk/aastolen.htm Victoria Cross.org.uk]</ref> Several VCs have been stolen, and being valuable have been placed on the [[Interpol]] watch-list for stolen items.<ref>[http://www.victoriacross.org.uk/aastolen.htm http://www.victoriacross.org.uk/aastolen.htm]</ref>

The VC awarded to [[Milton Fowler Gregg|Milton Gregg]], which was donated to the [[Royal Canadian Regiment Museum]] in [[London, Ontario]] [[Canada]] in 1979. It was stolen on [[Canada Day]], ([[July 1]], [[1980]]), when the museum was overcrowded, and has been missing since. A VC awarded in 1917 to Corporal [[Filip Konowal]],<ref>[http://www.infoukes.com/history/konowal/ http://www.infoukes.com/history/konowal/]</ref> a Canadian soldier, was stolen from the same museum in 1973 and was not recovered until 2004.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/story/canada/national/2004/08/23/victoria040823.html http://www.cbc.ca/story/canada/national/2004/08/23/victoria040823.html]</ref>

==Other==
Ugandan Dictator [[Idi Amin]] awarded himself the VC along with many other high level medals and orders.  This awarding of the VC is unofficial and is not recorded in any official figures.
