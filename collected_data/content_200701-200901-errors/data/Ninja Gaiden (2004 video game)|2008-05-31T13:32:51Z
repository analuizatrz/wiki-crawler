'''''Ninja Gaiden''''' is an [[action-adventure game]] developed by [[Team Ninja]] for the [[Xbox]] video game console. It went through five years of development before its release by [[Tecmo]] in 2004. The game was a hit in [[North America]]; it sold 362,441&nbsp;copies in the first month. Reception in [[Japan]], however, was poor; consumers bought around 60,000&nbsp;copies in the four months following its release.

''Ninja Gaiden'' used the name and the main character, [[Ryu Hayabusa]], of the [[Ninja Gaiden (video game)|1990s series]] that ran on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]; those were, however, the only direct connections between the two games. The 2004 version of ''Ninja Gaiden'' had a new story that takes place in the settings of another Team Ninja game, the [[Dead or Alive (series)|''Dead or Alive'' series]]. An evil force has raided the Hayabusa village and stolen the Dark Dragon Blade from its care. The player controls Ryu in his quest to avenge the deaths of his clan and to reclaim the stolen blade. The game featured the use of many weapons and magic spells to destroy hordes of enemies.

''Ninja Gaiden'' was the focus of an online series of matches that spanned North America, [[Europe]], and Japan. Record-breaking numbers of players took part and the final took place at [[Tokyo Game Show|Tokyo Game Show 2004]]. The game continued to evolve in the three years following its release through content downloaded from [[Xbox Live]] and re-releases. ''Ninja Gaiden'' has also received much critical acclaim; several critics named it as one of the best and most difficult games ever made.

==Gameplay==
''Ninja Gaiden'' develops its narrative thread through the actions of its player-controlled protagonist, [[Ryu Hayabusa]]. Viewed from a [[Third-person shooter|third person]] over-the-shoulder perspective, in typical [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] fashion Ryu starts the game with basic, low-level abilities and weapons that can be upgraded as he progresses, by discovering or buying items. In keeping with his [[ninja]] persona, his character can interact with the game environment to perform acrobatic feats, such as running along and jumping off walls, swinging from pole to pole, or running across water.<ref name="gsngrev">{{cite web

</ref> Eric Williams, the designer of the ''God of War'' combat engine, explained that ''Ninja Gaiden'' prohibits players from stopping or changing attacks in mid-stroke. In contrast, ''God of War'' allows players to do so, and ''Devil May Cry'' grants this freedom to certain attacks. Williams said that, compared to those two games, the combat system in ''Ninja Gaiden'' was harder to master; however, it let players fight their computer controlled foes on equal terms.<ref name="mech" />

[[Image:Ninja Gaiden DS Prep.jpg|thumb|200px|left|In ''Ninja Gaiden'', players can draw in 'essences' to launch Ultimate Techniques that allow Ryu to damage enemies without taking damage himself. Click [[Media:Ninja Gaiden DS UT.gif|here]] to watch an Ultimate Technique in action. ]]
''Ninja Gaiden'' features a large selection of weapons for Ryu to wield, each with advantages and disadvantages that affect the way the player approaches combat. These include one-handed swords, such as the Dragon Sword and Kitetsu, which grant quick attacks and a move called the "Flying Swallow", that allows Ryu to leap and slash through enemies. In addition these light weapons allow Ryu to smash foes into the ground and perform his signature Izuna Drop&mdash;a spinning [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)|piledriver]]. Heavy weapons, such as the Dabilahro and the Unlabored Flawlessness, are slow but cause more damage to opponents. With [[flail]]s and [[Staff (stick)|staves]], the player can string together long sequences of attacks, and to engage disant foes Ryu can throw [[shuriken]] and shoot arrows.<ref name="gsngrev" /><ref>{{cite web

In addition to using standard melee techniques, Ryu can employ 'essences' in combat. These are colored globes of energy that are released on the death of enemies, and absorbed into Ryu's body when he comes into proximity with them. Essences have an important role in general gameplay, acting to heal Ryu, restore his magic, or increase his cash. However, in combat the player can cause Ryu to deliberately draw in essences, which can then be used to unleash powerful attacks known as Ultimate Techniques.<ref name="denngb" /> These techniques deal heavy damage and make Ryu immune to injury for a short time.<ref name="eurong">{{cite web

''Ninja Gaiden'' also provides Ryu with magical spells in the form of ''ninpos''. When activated by the player, these make Ryu cast fireballs, ice storms, or bolts of lightning.

For Ryu's defense, the player has two options. First, Ryu can stand still and attempt to block attacks. However, certain enemies can break his guard&mdash;either through particularly strong attacks or by [[grappling]] him. The second option is to make Ryu dodge, by rolling away from the attack in a maneuver called "reverse wind".<ref name="denngb" />

</ref> Rachel also serves as the occasional [[damsel in distress]] for Ryu to rescue. She is not a player character in ''Ninja Gaiden''. However, players can control her in a few sections of the remake, ''Ninja Gaiden Sigma''.<ref name="sigpre" />

Two other characters help the player in the game. [[List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Supporting characters 2|Ayane]] is a female ninja and one of the ''DOA'' regular cast members. She acts as a guide throughout Ninja Gaiden by giving objectives and tips to the player. The other character is [[List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Supporting characters 2|Muramasa]]. He is a [[bladesmith]] and has shops spread over the game world. He sells players items and upgrades their weapons. He also gives [[back-story|back-stories]], [[quest (gaming)|quests]], and crucial information; he tells Ryu to find the Dragon Eye jewel at the Hayabusa village to upgrade the Dragon Sword to its full potential.

Team Ninja created many types of enemies for ''Ninja Gaiden''. Itagaki found it more interesting to create nonhuman creatures than to create human soldiers and ninjas.<ref name="giint" /> As such, most of the enemies in the game are fiends, which are humans changed into monsters by the blood curse. Three Greater Fiends lead the fiends against Ryu and play major roles in the story. First, there is Alma. The story between Rachel and her is a major part of the game. Doku is the main [[antagonist]] of the game; he raids the Hayabusa village, steals the Dark Dragon Blade, and causes the discord between the sisters. The last Greater Fiend is [[List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Leaders of the Fiends|Marbus]] who is responsible for the last set of challenges standing in Ryu's way to the Emperor of the fiends.<ref>{{cite video game

</ref>

Team Ninja based their [[3D modeling|3D computer models]] on real world material; the pistols of the henchman, Gamov, were faithful models of real world handguns. Team Ninja also created the character models based on studies of human anatomy. Besides this, the team hired [[Martial arts|martial artists]] and digitally captured their moves. They did not use the [[motion capture]]s directly for the game. Their animators used these captures as a basis to give a sense of realism to the game characters' exaggerated moves. Team Ninja also gave players the option to customize the player characters; this came as costumes for Ryu and hairstyles for Rachel.<ref name="sigpre" />

===Story===
The story of Ryu and his quest for vengeance spans sixteen chapters. Each chapter starts and ends with a cut scene. At the start of the game, the player takes control of Ryu as he invades the Shadow clan fortress. Ryu is there to visit the clan leader, [[List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Ninjas|Murai]], who is his uncle. During their chat, Ayane runs in and delivers news of a raid on the Hayabusa village. Ryu fights his way back to his village and encounters Doku who has taken the Dark Dragon Blade and killed Kureha, the Hayabusa [[miko|shrine maiden]]. The encounter ends with Doku cutting Ryu down with the Blade. Before the screen [[Fade (film)|fades out]], it lingers on a [[falcon]] watching over Ryu's body. The falcon is the spiritual animal of the Hayabusas and brings Ryu back to life offscreen.<ref>{{cite journal

The realm starts to collapse on the Emperor's death and the player has to navigate Ryu [[Jumping puzzle|up a series of ledges]] to escape.

Ryu loses his grip on the recovered Dark Dragon Blade in his escape. It lands at the feet of the Dark Disciple who has been shadowing Ryu throughout the story. The Disciple picks up the Blade and unmasks himself as Murai. He admits that the raid on the Hayabusa village was part of his plan to restore the Blade's evil power with souls gathered from Ryu's quest of vengeance.<ref>{{cite video game

In 1999, Team Ninja started work on the "Next-Generation Ninja Gaiden Project".<ref name="history" /> In the first stage of development, they created the game on the [[List of Sega arcade system boards#Sega NAOMI|Sega NAOMI]] arcade system board.

However, this came to a halt when Sega announced the end of Dreamcast product line in 2001.<ref name="edge" /> At this point, Tecmo decided to make ''Ninja Gaiden'' as a launch title for the [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]] {{nowraplinks}}[[PlayStation 2]]{{nowraplinks end}} in the United States.<ref>{{cite news

The two Packs were available over Xbox Live in the third quarter of 2004.

</ref> Hence, he made ''Black'' put on a mocking tone for those playing on Ninja Dog; the players receive pink ribbons as accessories and watch Ayane treat Ryu as an inferior. Itagaki also made the other difficulties in ''Black'' harder than they were in ''Ninja Gaiden''. He changed the foes to be stronger and more aggressive and toned down moves that were too powerful such as the Flying Swallow.<ref name="denngb" />

Another key feature of ''Black'' is Mission Mode, which comprised 50&nbsp;missions of pure combat action. One mission is adapted from the game played in the Ninja Gaiden Master Tournament World Championship final. Furthermore, the last five missions linked together to compose Eternal Legend; this linked series of missions was a revamped ''Hurricane Pack&nbsp;2'' using the game engine of ''Black''.<ref name="ngbpre" />

</ref> Its remake, ''Ninja Gaiden Black'', still impressed critics. GameSpot hailed it for having the best visual and audio presentation on the Xbox. They also praised its new feature, Mission Mode, for "[distilling] the game down to its purest essentials".<ref name="gsngbrev" /> IGN called its release as "a rare and welcome day", which "[brought their] excitement levels back to the first time [they] played the game".<ref name="ignngbrev" />

From a technical point of view, critics regarded ''Ninja Gaiden'' and ''Black'' as the best of Xbox software; they pushed the console hardware to its limits without showing significant drops in performance. GameSpot was impressed with their "first-rate presentation" and said that none of the games at that time came close in visuals and audios.<ref name="gsngbrev" /> IGN said the games could "make [them] momentarily forget about the next generation of consoles".<ref name="ignngbrev" /> ''Ninja Gaiden'' and ''Black'' were top-selling Xbox games, which led to them being [[backward compatibility|compatible]] with the [[Xbox 360]] for all regions on its release.<ref>{{cite news

However, critics varied in their views on the technical aspects of ''Ninja Gaiden Sigma''. The gaming site, [[1UP.com]], called the updated graphics as "a gorgeous reworking of the modern ninja classic".<ref name="sig1uprev" /> [[Pro-G]], however, said that they were average by next-generation standards and showed occasional "tearing, jagged edges, and miss matched collision between bloodstains and walls".<ref name="prosigrev" /> Various flaws also troubled 1UP. They encountered frequent loadings, even in combat despite installing the game on the local hard drive. They also saw visual glitches such as [[screen tearing]] when the camera moved. These flaws made the game "feel like a bit of a slapdash port".<ref name="sig1uprev" />

Although critics praised ''Sigma'' for retaining the gameplay in the previous games,<ref name="ignau" /><ref name="sig1uprev" /> its lack of new attractive features made them question its worth as "a remake of a remake". Pro-G said that ''Sigma'' was not worth a full priced game because it "has, in effect, been available for years in one form or another".<ref name="prosigrev" /> [[Eurogamer]] stated that ''Sigma'' lacked the "wow factor" when compared to ''God of War'' and ''[[God of War II|its sequel]]''.<ref name="eusigrev" /> The 1UP critic said that shaking the Sixaxis to power up a ninpo was "silly" and a "foolishly tacked-on" way to use the controller.<ref name="sig1uprev" /> IGN was not excited about playing as Rachel and wished to "get back to Ryu's sections simply because he's more fun to play".<ref name="ignsigrev" /> DailyGame, however, said that her slow pace brings "much-needed respite for newcomers and provide something new for experienced players".<ref>{{cite web

A common criticism of the ''Ninja Gaiden'' games was with the camera. The default camera system centers the action on Ryu and his surroundings. It has also improved with the use of manual controls since the ''Hurricane Packs''.<ref name="hurhands1" /><ref name="gsngbrev" /> There are, however, times when the camera locks on to an object and loses track of Ryu, which made the critics mad.<ref name="ignngbrev" /><ref name="entdep" /><ref name="trend" /> However, most critics judged that either the camera was usually decent or the gameplay was good enough to cover up its flaws.<ref name="gsngbrev" /><ref name="ignsigrev" />

The ''Ninja Gaiden'' games gained a reputation throughout the gaming community for their difficulty and details.<ref name="history" /><ref>{{cite journal

</ref> Although they appealed to gamers who are like Pro-G in wanting a "bloody hard, but also bloody good" challenge,<ref name="prongrev" /> casual gamers might find the learning curve daunting. IGN warned that gamers with lesser skills might not "get as much out of this game as others due to [its] incredible difficulty".<ref name="ignngbrev" /> Clive Thompson focused on ''Ninja Gaiden'' in his ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' article on the rewards of beating difficult games. He said that there are games so hard that players get mad in trying to beat them and stay mad even after doing so. ''Ninja Gaiden'', however, rewarded players who beat the game; it brought them "a sort of exhausted exhilaration, like finally reaching the end of ''[[War and Peace]]''". The game was a success in striking balance between challenge and reward.<ref>{{cite web
