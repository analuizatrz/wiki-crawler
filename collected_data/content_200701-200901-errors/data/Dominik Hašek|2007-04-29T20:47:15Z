'''Dominik Hašek''' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] {{IPA|['dominɪk 'haʃɛk]}}) (born [[January 29]], [[1965]], in [[Pardubice]], [[Czechoslovakia]]) is a professional [[National Hockey League]] [[goaltender]] for the [[Detroit Red Wings]]. In his 15-season NHL career, he has also played for the [[Chicago Blackhawks]], [[Buffalo Sabres]] and the [[Ottawa Senators]]. During his years in Buffalo, he became one of the league's finest goaltenders, earning him the nickname "The Dominator." His strong play is credited for bringing European goaltenders into a league where the position was once widely dominated by North Americans.<ref name = "return">{{cite news

Hašek has been one of the league's most successful goaltenders over the past decade and a half. In an eight season span from [[1992-93 NHL season|1993]] to [[2000-01 NHL season|2001]] he won six [[Vezina Trophy|Vezina Trophies]], and in 1998 he became the first goaltender to win consecutive [[Hart Memorial Trophy|Hart Trophies]].<ref name = "azhockey">{{cite web

Hašek is considered a very unorthodox goaltender, with a distinct play style that has labeled him as a "flopper."<ref name="MainBio">{{cite web|url=http://hockeygoalies.org/bio/hasek.html|title=Dominik Hasek (1990-present)|publisher=hockeygoalies.org|accessdate=2007-04-24|year=2007}}</ref> He is best known for his excellent concentration, his tremendous foot speed and his immense flexibility, all of which help him make extremely difficult saves. He will often drop his stick and grab a loose puck with his blocker hand rather than use the conventional [[Glove (hockey)|trapper]], and is generally weak with his stick play.<ref name="MainBio"/>

Hasek is regarded as a future Hall of Famer by those in the hockey world.<ref>{{cite news

==Early Life==
In his native [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], Hašek started playing hockey at a very young age. His competitive goaltending career began at the age of six, as he explains:<ref name="flex">{{cite news

At the age of 16, Hašek made the move to the top level of Czech hockey, playing for his home team in the Czech league's First Division. After moving up the ranks and eventually playing for the Czechoslovakian National team, Hašek thought he was ready for the NHL. He was drafted by the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] in [[1983 NHL Entry Draft|1983]], and despite being a very talented player, he was selected in the 10th round, 199th overall. This was mainly due to the unwillingness of NHL teams to draft players from behind the [[Iron Curtain]], as players' countries often barred them from playing in the NHL, or the players themselves preferred not to go. It would be several months before Hašek would find out that he was even drafted.<ref name="draft">{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=18282|title=Dominik Hasek|publisher=legendsofhockey.net|accessdate=2006-08-05}}</ref>

From that point up until 1990, Hašek played in his native Czechoslovakia for the [[Czechoslovak Extraliga]] teams [[HC Pardubice]] and [[HC Jihlava]]. He also played parts of two seasons in the [[International Hockey League|IHL]] with the [[Indianapolis Ice]]. He was named the [[Golden Hockey Stick (Czechoslovakia)|top ice hockey player]] in Czechoslovakia in 1987, 1989, and 1990, along with being named Czechoslovakian Goaltender of the Year from 1986 through 1990.<ref>[http://tsn.ca/nhl/teams/players/bio/?id=126&hubname=nhl-red_wings TSN.ca player profile]</ref> After [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)|communist rule ended]] in 1991, the borders of the Soviet Union opened, allowing him to emigrate to the United States with aspirations of playing in the NHL.<ref name="draft"/> His debut with the Blackhawks finally came in the [[1990-91 NHL season|1990-91 season]], eight years after the 1983 NHL Entry Draft.

==NHL career==
In Chicago, Hašek spent time as the backup to [[Ed Belfour]], and only played 25 games over two seasons with the Blackhawks. He made his NHL debut on November 6, 1990 in a game against the [[Hartford Whalers]] and wore the number 31. He would record his first shutout against the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] later that year.

On [[August 7]], [[1992]], Hašek was traded to the [[Buffalo Sabres]] for goalie [[Stephane Beauregard]] and future considerations, which later materialized into a draft pick used to obtain [[Eric Daze]]. In Buffalo, wearing number 39, he was initially the backup goaltender, first playing behind [[Tom Draper]] and then [[Grant Fuhr]]. When Fuhr was injured partway through the season, Hašek was elevated to starter, where he displayed his talent and began to develop into a top tier goaltender.

In [[1993-94 NHL season|1994]], Hašek won his first [[Vezina Trophy]], and he shared the [[William M. Jennings Trophy]] with teammate Grant Fuhr. Hašek played 58 games with a league-best 1.95 [[Goals against average|GAA]], seven shutouts, and a .930 [[save percentage]]. He followed this feat by again winning the Vezina Trophy in [[1994-95 NHL season|1995]].

====Buffalo (1996-1998)====

The regular season success of the Sabres in [[1996-97 NHL season|1996-97]] was overshadowed by several conflicts, including one between Hašek and then-head coach [[Ted Nolan]], which contributed to a clique-like atmosphere in the franchise.<ref name="rattling">{{cite news

Tensions were high for most of the season, and after the [[Ottawa Senators]] scored on Hašek in game three of the first round of the playoffs, he was replaced by [[Steve Shields (hockey player)|Steve Shields]]. Hašek claimed he felt his knee pop, and the team doctor pronounced him day-to-day. Being integral to the Sabres' Cup run, the media (and some teammates) speculated that Hašek was using his injury to bail out on the team.<ref name="rattling"/> ''Buffalo News'' columnist [[Jim Kelley]] wrote a column that night that appeared in the following day's newspaper that detailed Hašek's injury and the conflict with Nolan, and accused Hašek of having poor mental toughness.<ref name="kelley">{{cite news

Shields starred as the Sabres rallied to win the series against Ottawa. However, Hašek claimed his knee was still injured throughout the next series against the [[Philadelphia Flyers]], which saw the Sabres' elimination in five games.

Though General Manager [[John Muckler]] was named "Executive of the Year", he was fired for his constant feuding with Nolan. Hašek, who sided with Muckler, stated in an interview during the 1997 NHL Awards Ceremony that it would be better of Nolan was not rehired.<ref>{{cite news

Despite winning the [[Jack Adams Award]] as top coach, Nolan was only offered a one-year contract extension by replacement GM [[Darcy Regier]], which he rejected under the grounds that it was too short.

As the season progressed, Hašek played well and won back many fans; he again won the Vezina Trophy, as well as the [[Lester B. Pearson Award]] and the [[Hart Trophy]]. At the time, he was only the second goalie to ever win the Hart, along with [[Jacques Plante]].

Hasek played a career high 72 games in the [[1997-98 NHL season|1997-98 season]], and set a team record with 13 shutouts. Six of these shutouts came in December, which tied the all-time NHL record for most in one month.<ref name="HockeydCentral">{{cite web|url=http://www.hockeydraftcentral.com/1983/83199.html|title=Dominik Hasek Bio at HockeyDraftCentral|publisher=hockeydraftcentral.com|accessdate=2007-04-24|year=2007}}</ref> He again won the Lester B.

====1999 Stanley Cup Finals====
[[Image:Hasek hull goal.jpg|right|thumb|An overhead shot of Hull's controversial goal]]

In [[1998-99 NHL season|1999]], Hašek notched a career best 1.87 GAA and .937 save percentage, easily capturing him his third consecutive Vezina. He also finished runner-up for the Hart and Pearson trophies. Though the Sabres did not have a stellar regular season and finished with the seventh seed in the [[Eastern Conference (NHL)|Eastern Conference]], they defeated the [[Ottawa Senators]], [[Boston Bruins]], and [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] in the playoffs en route to a best-of-seven Stanley Cup Final against the [[Presidents' Trophy]]-winning [[Dallas Stars]]. The Sabres eventually lost the series four games to two, with the decisive sixth game being one of the longest Stanley Cup playoff games in NHL history. Hašek and [[Ed Belfour]] made 50 and 53 saves, respectively, in a sudden-death [[Overtime (ice hockey)|triple-overtime]] duel that only ended when [[Brett Hull]] scored a controversial Cup-winning goal with his foot in the crease. <ref name = "hull goal">{{cite news

====Final years with Buffalo (1999-2001)====

Due to persistent injuries, Hašek's [[1999-2000 NHL season|1999-00 season]] was comparatively poor, and, for the first time in several years, he failed to win a major NHL award. Though he recovered in time for the playoffs, the Sabres were eliminated in the first round after five games against the Philadelphia Flyers.

The [[2000-01 NHL season|2000-01 season]] would be Hašek's final year in Buffalo, and would see him winning the Vezina Trophy for the sixth time, the most of any goaltender in the modern era. He also won his second [[William M. Jennings Trophy]]. The Sabres were again matched up with Philadelphia in the first round, where Hašek outplayed his Czech compatriot and 1998 Olympic back-up [[Roman Cechmanek]].  Hašek led the Sabres to an 8-0 blanking of the Flyers in the clinching sixth game. In the second round, the Sabres played a dramatic seven-game series against [[Mario Lemieux]]'s [[Pittsburgh Penguins]], which culminated with the Penguins winning the final game in overtime.

====Detroit and Ottawa (2001-present)====
Prior to the start of [[2001-02 NHL season|the next season]], Hašek was traded to the [[Detroit Red Wings]] in an attempt to lower the Sabres' payroll and to send Hašek to a more competitive team.<ref name = "return"/> He was dealt for [[Vyacheslav Kozlov]], a first round selection in the [[2002 NHL Entry Draft]] (which eventually became the draft pick of [[Jim Slater (ice hockey)|Jim Slater]]), and future considerations. 

During his first season with Detroit, Hašek posted a career high 41 wins with just 15 losses, helping the Red Wings earn the President's Trophy with the league's best record. In the playoffs, he led the Wings past the [[Vancouver Canucks]], the [[St. Louis Blues]], the [[Colorado Avalanche]] and eventually the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] in the finals to win the [[Stanley Cup]]. In the finals, he became the first goalie to be awarded an assist on an overtime game-winning goal in the post-season after passing the puck to Wings captain [[Steve Yzerman]], who then assisted [[Fredrik Olausson]] in scoring the final goal. He also claimed the record for most shutouts in a post-season with six, though [[Martin Brodeur]] of the [[New Jersey Devils]] immediately broke the record in [[2002-03 NHL season|2003]].

That summer Hašek officially announced his retirement so he could spend time with his family and other hobbies, and claimed that his career was complete.<ref name="comeback">

After Detroit's first round loss to the [[Anaheim Ducks|Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]] in the [[2002-03 NHL season|following season]], he announced his desire to play again. However, the Red Wings had two years left on [[Curtis Joseph]]'s three-year $24 million contract, which had a no-trade clause. Detroit was also under pressure with the knowledge that the rival [[Colorado Avalanche]] would be looking for a goalie to replace [[Patrick Roy]] after his retirement.<ref name="comeback"/> With [[Manny Legacé]] also on the Wings' roster, Detroit now had three potential starting goalies.

The [[2003-04 NHL season|2003-04 season]] was problematic for Hašek, as he injured his groin after playing just 14 games. Early into the 2004 year on [[January 9]], he and the team agreed he should rest his injury for two to four weeks. Hašek told general manager [[Ken Holland]] that he would not accept any pay while he was injured; he did not make his refusal public at the time. On [[February 10]], he announced that he was not going to continue to play that season, surprising the Red Wings management.<ref>

Hasek played increasingly well for the Senators up until the [[2006 Winter Olympics]]. During the season, he reached 300 career wins, and his GAA and save percentage were the second-best in the league. However, at the Olympics, he injured his right [[Adductor muscles of the hip|adductor muscle]] making a save in the first match against [[Germany at the 2006 Winter Olympics#Ice hockey|Germany]].<ref>{{cite news

Despite the loss, the [[Czech Republic at the 2006 Winter Olympics#Ice hockey|Czech Republic]] finished in third place, and Hašek was awarded the [[bronze medal]] after playing just 9 minutes and 25 seconds.

Hašek's injury caused him to miss the rest of the regular season and post-season despite several rumours that he would return in time for [[2006 Stanley Cup Playoffs|the playoffs]]. Hašek said that if he were to be re-signed, he would play for a base salary of just $500,000 with bonuses.<ref>{{cite news

After the Senators were eliminated, they opted not to re-sign Hašek. On [[July 31]], [[2006]], at the age of 41, Hašek joined the Red Wings for the third time in his career. He signed a one-year $750,000 US contract, with added bonuses if the team succeeds in the playoffs.

Hašek then shut out the [[Russian national ice hockey team|Russian team]] 1-0 in the final game, stopping 20 shots. He was later announced as the best goaltender in the Olympics, leaving him overjoyed. After he won the gold, he was quoted as saying:<ref name="OlympicQuote">

Despite his absence, the Czechs managed to earn the bronze medal with backup goaltender [[Tomas Vokoun]], which Hašek received as well.

He is extraordinarily flexible, so much that at one point in his childhood, doctors in his native country were marvelling at how he could contort himself to make saves.<ref name="flex"/>

Hašek goes down on almost every [[Shot (ice hockey)|shot]], covering the bottom of the net where most goals are scored. His play style of a "flopper" is attributed to the fact that he flops around in the crease and uses every part of his body to make saves. He has also been known to use his head to stop the [[puck]]. Occasionally, Hašek will even drop his stick and cover the puck with his blocking hand, while most goaltenders would use the [[Glove (hockey)|trapper]] instead.<ref>

Because of his flexibility, Hašek manages to make saves that other goalies would consider very difficult &mdash; an opposing coach once referred to them as "miracle saves." These types of saves include toe-stops, snagging pucks from behind his back, and a maneuvre known as the "Hašek roll".<ref name="flex"/><ref name="HasekRoll">{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/print/CTVNews/20020131/ctvnews842010/20020131/?hub=CTVNewsAt11&subhub=PrintStory|title=Skudra helps Canucks tie the Oilers 2-2|publisher=CTV|accessdate=2007-01-22|year=2002}}</ref>

For his third stint in Detroit, he lost a considerable amount of weight between May and September of 2006 to increase his flexibility.

==Off the ice==
Hašek and his wife Alena have two children: a son named Michal (born 1989) and a daughter named Dominika (born 1994). He divides much of his free time playing [[squash (sport)|squash]] and [[inline hockey]], where he plays defense. When he was younger, Hašek played competitive soccer as a midfielder, and was a junior [[tennis]] champion in Eastern [[Bohemia]].<ref>{{cite web

His brother [[Martin Hašek|Martin]] is also a competitive athlete and currently plays for the Czech Republic soccer team [[AC Sparta Praha]]. Hobby-wise, Hasek claims that he has been a fan of professional wrestling since his Buffalo days, and says that he mostly follows his favorite wrestlers, [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] and [[Don Muraco]].<ref>{{cite web

Due to his formal education, Hašek stands out among Czech sportsmen. He earned a [[Academic degree|university degree]] after studying [[history]] and the [[Czech language]] in the Faculty of Education at the [[University of Hradec Králové]], which qualified him to be a teacher, and led him to teach high school classes.<ref name="education">{{cite news

{{h3|Inline hockey game incident}}
During an inline hockey game on [[May 18]], [[2003]], Hašek was accused of assaulting another player. He was playing as a defender for Bonfire Střída when he crosschecked Martin Šíla. The prosecutor in the case, Lenka Strnadová, ruled two months later that there was no evidence that Hašek intended bodily harm and recommended the case be treated as a misdemeanor, punishable only by fine ($95 USD maximum), rather than a felony where jail time would have been possible.<ref>{{cite news

In October 2003, the country's top prosecutor overruled Strnadová, saying her ruling was unlawful because the case had not been properly investigated. The Pardubice prosecution then investigated the case again, and reached the same decision as Strnadová.<ref>{{cite web

===Milestones===
Hašek won his 300th National Hockey League game on [[October 15]], [[2005]], in a 5-1 home victory with the [[Ottawa Senators]] over the [[Boston Bruins]]. He stopped 34 of 35 shots in the win, and was holding a shutout until Bruins forward [[Pat Leahy (ice hockey)|Pat Leahy]] jammed a loose puck under him three minutes into the third period. Hasek became the twenty-second goaltender to reach this milestone.<ref name="MainBio"/> He is the oldest goaltender in NHL history to post a 30-win season, and was the first goaltender to ever win the [[Lester B. Pearson Award]] in [[1996-97 NHL season|1997]] for most outstanding player in the entire league. He is also the only goaltender to win the [[Hart Trophy]] twice for Most Valuable Player, and is only one [[Vezina Trophy]] away from tying [[Jacques Plante]]'s total of seven for most all-time.
