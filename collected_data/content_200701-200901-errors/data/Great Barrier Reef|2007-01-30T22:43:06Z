A large part of the reef is protected by the [[Great Barrier Reef Marine Park]].

The Great Barrier Reef can be seen from [[outer space]] and is sometimes referred to as the single [[largest organism]] in the world. In reality, it is made up of many millions of tiny organisms, known as [[coral]] [[polyp]]s.  The Great Barrier Reef was also selected as a [[World Heritage Site]] in 1981.<ref name="UNEP"/><ref name="GBRWHV"/>  [[CNN]] has labelled it one of the [[Seven Wonders of the World#Natural wonders|seven natural wonders of the world]].<ref>{{cite web|author=CNN|year=1997|title=The Seven Natural Wonders of the World|url=http://www.cnn.com/TRAVEL/DESTINATIONS/9711/natural.wonders/|accessdate=2006-08-06}}</ref>  The Queensland National Trust has named it a state icon of Queensland.<ref>{{cite web|author=National Trust Queensland | title= Queensland Icons| url=http://www.nationaltrustqld.org/qldicons.htm| accessdate=2006-10-17}}</ref>

==Geology and Geography==
[[Image:Part of Great Barrier Reef from Helecopter.JPG|right|250px|thumb|An aerial photograph of a section of the Great Barrier Reef]]

<!-- The oldest dated coral on the reef now is a species of [[Porites]] known as [[boulder coral]], which is only about 1,000 years old (it grows about 1 centimetre per year). Note--this used to be in the Reef Facts for Tour Guides reference until they updated it in 2006. It should not appear in this wiki article until it can be confirmed from a scientific publication.-->

The Reef Resarch Centre, a [[Cooperative Research Centre]], has found coral 'skeleton' [[Deposit (geology)|deposits]] that date back half a million years.<ref name = "CRCage">{{cite web|author=CRC Reef Research Centre Ltd|title=What is the Great Barrier Reef?|url=http://www.reef.crc.org.au/discover/coralreefs/coralgbr.html|accessdate=2006-05-28}}</ref>  Corals have been growing in the region for as long as 25 million years, but have not always formed coral reefs.<ref name = "GBRMPAage">{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|year=2006|title=Fact Sheet 1 - Reef Facts For Tour Guides - The Big Picture|url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/12437/Reef-Facts-01.pdf|accessdate=2006-12-02}} (PDF)</ref>

Dating [[wikt:discrepancy|discrepancies]] stem from the fact that reefs fluctuate (grow and recede) as the [[sea level]] changes.  They can increase in diameter from 1 to 2 centimetres per year, and grow vertically anywhere from 1 to 15 centimetres per year; however, they are limited to above a depth of 150 metres due to their need for sunlight, and cannot grow above sea level.<ref>{{cite web|author=MSN Encarta|year=2006 |title=Great Barrier Reef| url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761575831/Great_Barrier_Reef.html|accessdate=2006-12-11}}</ref>

According to the [[Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority]], the current, living reef structure is believed to have begun growing on an older platform about 20,000 years ago.<ref name = "GBRMPAage"/>  The [[Australian Institute of Marine Science]] agrees, which places the beginning of the growth of the current reef at the time of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]].  At around that time, the sea level was 120 metres lower than it is today.  The land that formed the [[wiktionary:substrate|substrate]] of the Great Barrier Reef was a [[coastal plain]] with some larger hills (some of which were themselves remnants of older reefs).<ref name ="AIMSage">{{cite web | last = Tobin  | first = Barry  | title = How the Great Barrier Reef was formed  | publisher = Australian Institute of Marine Science  | date = 1998, revised 2003  | url = http://www.aims.gov.au/pages/research/project-net/reefs/apnet-reefs00.html  | accessdate = 2006-11-22 }}</ref>

From 20,000 years ago until 6,000 years ago, the [[Sea level rise|sea level rose]] steadily.  As the sea level rose, the corals could grow higher on the hills of the coastal plain.  By around 13,000 years ago the sea level was 60 metres less than the present day, and corals began to grow around the hills of the coastal plain - by then, [[Island#Continental islands|continental island]]s.  As the sea level rose further still, most of the continental islands were submerged.  The corals could then overgrow the hills, to form the present [[cay]]s and reefs.  Sea level on the Great Barrier Reef has not risen significantly in the last 6,000 years.<ref name="AIMSage"/>The research outcomes funded by the CRC Reef Research Centre estimates the age of the present, living reef structure at 6,000 to 8,000 years old.<ref name="CRCage"/>

In the northern part of the Great Barrier Reef, [[ribbon reef]]s and [[deltaic reef]]s have formed - these reef structures are not found in the rest of the Great Barrier Reef system.<ref name="CRCage"/>  The remains of an ancient barrier reef similar to the Great Barrier Reef can be found in [[The Kimberley]], a northern region of [[Western Australia]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Western Australia's Department of Conservation and Land Management|year=2005|title=The Devonian 'Great Barrier Reef'|url=http://www.calm.wa.gov.au/national_parks/previous_parks_month/devonian_feature.html|accessdate=2006-08-08}}</ref>

==Species of the Great Barrier Reef==
[[Image:Turtle06.jpg|right|thumb|Green Sea Turtle on the Great Barrier Reef]]
The Great Barrier Reef supports a diversity of life, including many [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]] or [[Endangered species|endangered]] [[species]].  30 species of whales, dolphins, or porpoises have been recorded in the Great Barrier Reef, including the [[Minke Whale|Dwarf Minke Whale]], [[Humpback dolphin|Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphin]] and the [[Humpback Whale]].  Also, large populations of [[dugong]]s live there.  Six species of [[sea turtle]] come to the reef to breed &ndash; [[Green Sea Turtle]], [[Leatherback Sea Turtle]], [[Hawksbill turtle]], [[Loggerhead Sea Turtle]], [[Flatback Turtle]] and the [[Olive Ridley]].  15 species of seagrass attract the dugongs and turtles.  
Over 200 species of birds (including 40 species of waterbirds) live on the Great Barrier Reef, including the [[White-bellied Sea Eagle]] and [[Roseate tern|Roseate Tern]].  
5000 species of [[mollusc]] have been recorded on the Great Barrier Reef including the [[Giant clam|Giant Clam]] and various [[nudibranch]]es and [[cone snail]]s. 17 species of [[sea snake]] live on the Great Barrier Reef.  More than 1500 species of fish live on the reef, including the [[Clownfish]], Red Bass, Red-Throat Emperor, and several species of [[Snapper]] and Coral Trout.  400 species of corals, both  [[hard coral]]s and [[soft coral]]s are found on the reef.  500 species of [[marine algae]] or [[seaweed]] live on the reef.  The [[irukandji jellyfish]] also lives on the reef.<ref>{{cite web|author=CRC Reef Research Centre Ltd|title=REEF FACTS: Plants and Animals on the Great Barrier Reef|url=http://www.reef.crc.org.au/discover/plantsanimals/facts_plantanimal.htm|accessdate=2006-07-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|title=Fauna and Flora of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area|url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/info_services/publications/misc_pub/fauna_flora|accessdate=2006-11-24}}</ref>

==Environmental threats==
===Water quality===
[[Image:Gladstone,_Queensland,_Australia_-_Storage_Silos_on_the_Gladstone_waterfront.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Storage Silos on the Gladstone waterfront - An industrial area in the water catchment area.]]
The coastline of north [[Eastern states of Australia|eastern Australia]] has no major rivers, (except during tropical flood events caused by [[tropical cyclone]]s).  It also has several major urban centres including [[Cairns, Queensland|Cairns]], [[Townsville, Queensland|Townsville]], [[Mackay, Queensland|Mackay]], [[Rockhampton, Queensland|Rockhampton]] and the industrial city of [[Gladstone, Queensland|Gladstone]].

Cairns and Townsville are the largest of these coastal cities with populations of approximately 150,000 each.<ref>{{cite web|title=Office of Economic and Statistical Research|publisher=Office of Economic and Statistical Research|url=http://www.oesr.qld.gov.au|accessdate=2006-05-28}}</ref> Unlike most reef environments worldwide, the Great Barrier Reef is the only one where the [[water catchment area]] is home to industrialised [[urban area]]s and where extensive areas of coastal lands and rangelands have been used for agricultural and pastoral purposes.

Due to the range of human uses made of the water catchment area adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef some 400 of the 3000 reefs are within a risk zone where [[Water pollution|water quality]] has declined owing to sediment and chemical [[Surface runoff|runoff]] from farming, and to loss of coastal [[wetland]]s which are a natural filter. Principal agricultural activity is [[sugar cane]] farming in the wet tropics and cattle grazing in the dry tropics regions. Both are considered significant factors affecting water quality.<ref>{{cite web|author=Australian Government Productivity Commission|year=2003|title=Industries, Land Use and Water Quality in the Great Barrier Reef Catchment - Key Points|url=http://www.pc.gov.au/study/gbr/finalreport/keypoints.html|accessdate=2006-05-29}}</ref>

It is thought that the mechanism behind poor water quality affecting the reefs is due to increased light and oxygen [[Competition (biology)|competition]] from [[algae]], but it has also been suggested that poor water quality encourages the spread of [[infectious disease]]s among corals.<ref name= waterquality>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|year=2006|title=Principal water quality influences on Great Barrier Reef ecosystems|url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/key_issues/water_quality/principal_influences.html|accessdate=2006-10-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Rachel Nowak|publisher=New Scientist|date=[[2004-01-11]]|title=Sewage nutrients fuel coral disease|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn4539|accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref>  The long-term monitoring program has found an increase in incidences of coral disease in the period 1999-2002, although they dispute the claim that on the Great Barrier Reef, coral diseases are caused by [[anthropogenic]] pollution.<ref>{{cite web

===Climate change===
[[Image:Coral-reef-bioerosion.jpg|thumbnail|250px|left|''Bioerosion'' (coral damage) such as this may be caused by [[coral bleaching]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.biology.iastate.edu/intop/1Australia/Australia%20papers/Bioerosion.htm|title=Bioerosion: an essential, and often overlooked, aspect of reef ecology | date = [[17 April]] [[2003]] | accessdate = 2006-11-02 | author = Ryan Holl| publisher = [[Iowa State University]]}}</ref> ]]
Some people believe that the most significant threat to the status of the Great Barrier Reef and of the planet's other tropical reef [[ecosystem]]s is [[climate change]] - comprising of [[global warming]] and [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation|the El Niño effect]]. Many of the corals of the Great Barrier Reef are currently living at the upper edge of their temperature tolerance, as demonstrated in the [[coral bleaching]] events of the summers of 1998, 2002 and most recently 2006.<ref>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|title=Coral Bleaching and Mass Bleaching Events|url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/info_services/science/climate_change/coral_bleaching.html|acccessdate=2006-05-30}}</ref>

As demonstrated in 1998, 2002 and 2006, corals expel their [[photosynthesis|photosynthesising]] [[zooxanthella]]e and turn colourless, revealing their white [[calcium carbonate]] skeletons, under the stress of waters that remain too warm for too long. If the water does not cool within about a month, the coral will die. Australia experienced its warmest year on record in 2005. Abnormally high sea temperatures during the summer of 2005-2006 have caused massive coral bleaching in the [[Great Keppel Island|Keppel Island]] group.

Global warming may have triggered the collapse of reef ecosystems throughout the tropics. Increased global temperatures are thought by some to bring more violent [[tropical storm]]s, but reef systems are naturally resilient and recover from storm battering. While some believe that an upward trend in temperature will cause much more coral bleaching, others suggest that while reefs may die in certain areas, other areas will become habitable for corals, and form coral reefs. <ref>{{cite news|author=Greg Roberts|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|date=[[2003-01-19]]|title=Great barrier grief as warm-water bleaching lingers|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/01/19/1042911270265.html|accessdate=2006-05-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Kate Ravilious|publisher=New Scientist|date=[[2004-12-13]]|title=Coral reefs may grow with global warming|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn6763|accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref>

However, the trend towards [[ocean acidification]] suggests that as the sea's [[pH]] decreases, corals will become less able to secrete calcium carbonate.<ref>{{cite web|author=Kleypas, J.A., R.A. Feely, V.J. Fabry, C. Langdon, C.L. Sabine, and L.L. Robbins|title=Impacts of Ocean Acidification on Coral Reefs and Other Marine Calcifiers: A Guide for Further Research|url=http://www.ucar.edu/communications/Final_acidification.pdf|acccessdate=2006-10-18}}</ref>

Reef scientist [[Terry Done]] has predicted a 1 degree rise in [[Global climate|global temperature]] would result in 82 percent of the reef bleached, 2 degrees resulting in 97 percent and 3 degrees resulting in 'total devastation'.<ref> Woodford, J., (2004). "Great? Barrier Reef.", ''Australian Geographic'' vol 76, page 37-55.</ref>

===Crown-of-thorns starfish===
[[Image:CrownofThornsStarfish_Fiji_2005-10-12.jpg|thumb|right|130px|Crown-of-thorns starfish]]
The [[crown-of-thorns starfish]] is a coral reef predator that preys on coral polyps by climbing onto them, [[wiktionary:extrude|extruding]] the stomach over them, and releasing [[digestive enzyme]]s to then absorb the liquified tissue. An individual adult of this species can wipe out up to 6 [[square metre]]s of living reef in a single year.<ref>{{cite web|author=Pierre Madl|title=Marine Biology I - Acanthaster planci| url=http://www.sbg.ac.at/ipk/avstudio/pierofun/planci/planci.htm| accessdate=2006-08-28}}</ref>

Although large outbreaks of these starfish are believed to occur in natural cycles, human activity in and around the Great Barrier Reef can worsen the effects. Reduction of water quality associated with agriculture can cause the crown-of-thorns starfish [[larva]]e to thrive.  Overfishing of its natural predators, such as the [[Triton (mollusk)|Giant Triton]], is also considered to contribute to an increase in the number of crown-of-thorns starfish.<ref>{{cite web|author=CRC Reef Research Centre|title=Crown-of-thorns starfish on the Great Barrier Reef| url=http://www.reef.crc.org.au/publications/brochures/COTS_web_Nov2003.pdf| accessdate=2006-08-28}} (PDF)</ref> The CRC Reef Research Centre defines an outbreak of crown-of-thorns starfish to be when there are more than 30 adult starfish in an area of one [[hectare]].<ref>{{cite web|author=CRC Reef Research Centre|title=Managing crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks| url=http://www.reef.crc.org.au/discover/plantsanimals/cots/cotsmanage.html| accessdate=2006-10-18}} (PDF)</ref>

===Overfishing===
The unsustainable [[overfishing]] of [[keystone species]], such as the [[Triton (mollusk)|Giant Triton]], can cause disruption to [[food chain]]s vital to life on the reef.  Fishing also impacts the reef through increased pollution from boats, [[by-catch]] of unwanted species (such as dolphins and turtles) and reef [[habitat destruction]] from [[trawling]], [[anchors]] and nets.<ref>{{cite web|author=CSIRO Marine Research|year=1998|title=Environmental Effects of Prawn Trawling|url=http://www.marine.csiro.au/LeafletsFolder/26trawl/26.html|accessdate=2006-05-28}}</ref> As of the middle of 2004, approximately one-third of the [[Great Barrier Reef Marine Park]] is protected from species removal of any kind, including fishing, without written permission.<ref>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|title=Marine Park Zoning|url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/management/zoning/index.html|accessdate=2006-08-08}}</ref>

===Shipping===
Shipping accidents are also a real concern, as several commercial shipping routes pass through the Great Barrier Reef.  From 1985-2001, there were 11 collisions and 20 groundings on the inner Great Barrier Reef [[shipping route]]. The leading cause of shipping accidents in the Great Barrier Reef is [[Human reliability|human error]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Australian Maritime Safety Authority|year=2002|title=Great Barrier Reef Review Report - Review of ship safety and pollution prevention measures in the Great Barrier Reef|url=http://www.amsa.gov.au/shipping%5Fsafety/great%5Fbarrier%5Freef%5Freview/gbr%5Freview%5Freport/contents%5Fhtml%5Fversion.asp|accessdate=2006-10-19}}</ref>

Although the route through the Great Barrier Reef is not easy, reef pilots consider it safer than outside the reef in the event of mechanical failure, since a ship can sit safely while being repaired.  On the outside, wind and swell will push a ship towards the reef and the water is deep right up to the reef so anchoring is impossible.<ref>''Reef Dreams: Working The Reef'' [[Documentary film|TV documentary]], [[Australian Broadcasting Commission]], broadcast [[6 July]] [[2006]] [http://www.abc.net.au/tv/guide/netw/200607/programs/ZY6905A003D6072006T180400.htm]</ref>  [[Captain Cook]] in the ''[[HM Bark Endeavour|Endeavour]]'' nearly came to grief that way, being utterly becalmed and pushed towards the reef by the swell.  Right up to within 80 metres of the Great Barrier Reef, the water was so deep that no ground (to anchor against) could be felt with 220 metres of line.<ref name = cook>{{gutenberg|no=8106|name=Captain Cook's Journal During the First Voyage Round the World}}, for [[15 August]] [[1770]]</ref>

Waste and foreign species discharged in [[ballast water]] from ships (when purging procedures are not followed) are a [[biological hazard]] to the Great Barrier Reef.<ref>{{cite web|author=International Maritime Organization|year=1997|title=The IMO Guidelines Resolution A.868(20) GUIDELINES FOR THE CONTROL AND MANAGEMENT OF SHIPS' BALLAST WATER TO MINIMIZE THE TRANSFER OF HARMFUL AQUATIC ORGANISMS AND PATHOGENS|url=http://globallast.imo.org/index.asp?page=resolution.htm&menu=true|accessdate=2006-10-22}}</ref> [[Tributyltin]] (TBT) compounds found in some [[Biofouling|antifouling paint]] on ship hulls leaches into seawater and is toxic to marine organisms and humans; efforts are underway to restrict its use.<ref>{{cite web|author=International Maritime Organization|year=2002|title=IMO - towards sustainable development|url=http://www.imo.org/About/mainframe.asp?topic_id=741|accessdate=2006-10-22}}</ref>

===Oil===
It is suspected that the Great Barrier Reef is the cap to an [[Oil reservoir|oil trap]].  In the 1960s and early 1970s, there was some speculation about [[Oil well|drilling for oil]] and gas there.<ref>{{cite web|author=Australian Institute of Marine Science|year=1996|title=AIMS Science for Management of the Great Barrier Reef - The Great Barrier Reef at a Glance |url=http://www.aims.gov.au/pages/research/smgbr/smgbr10.html|accessdate=2006-11-10}}</ref> In 1970, two [[Royal Commission]]s were ordered "into exploratory and production drilling for petroleum in the area of the Great Barrier Reef".<ref>{{cite web|author=Parliament of Australia|year=2006|title=List of Royal Commissions, 1902-|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/library/INTGUIDE/LAW/royalcommissions.htm|accessdate=2006-10-22}}</ref><ref name="1975review"/>  Oil drilling is not permitted on the Great Barrier Reef, yet [[oil spill]]s are still considered "one of the biggest threats to the reef", with a total of 282 oil spills between 1987-2002.<ref name="waterquality"/>

==Human use of the Great Barrier Reef==
[[Image:Blue Linckia Starfish.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Starfish on coral - typically, tourists photograph the natural beauty of the reef.]]
The Great Barrier Reef has long been known to and utilised by [[Indigenous Australian]] people, whose occupation of the continent is thought to extend back 40,000 to 60,000 years or more.<ref>{{cite web|author=ReefED|date=unknown date|title=reefED - GBR Traditional Owners|url=http://www.reefed.edu.au/explorer/traditional_owners/index.html|accessdate=2006-05-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|date=2006 date|title=Fact Sheet No. 4 - Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People and the Great Barrier Reef Region|url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/2142/Fact_Sheet_04_IPLU.pdf|accessdate=2006-05-28}}</ref> For these 70 or so clan groups, the reef is also an important part of their [[Dreamtime]].

The Reef first became known to [[Europeans]] when the [[HM Bark Endeavour|HM Bark ''Endeavour'']], captained by explorer [[James Cook]], ran [[wiktionary:aground|aground]] there on [[June 11]], [[1770]] and sustained considerable damage. It was finally saved after lightening the ship as much as possible and re-floating it during an incoming tide.<ref name="cook"/>  One of the most famous wrecks was that of the [[HMS Pandora (1779)|HMS ''Pandora'']], which sank on [[August 29]], [[1791]] killing 35. The [[Queensland Museum]] has been leading archaeological digs to the ''Pandora'' since 1983.<ref>{{cite web| author=Queensland Museum| year=| title=HMS Pandora| url=http://www.qm.qld.gov.au/features/pandora/pandora.asp| accessdate=2006-10-12}}</ref>
===Management===
{{main|Great Barrier Reef Marine Park}}
After the Royal Commissions' findings, in 1975, the [[Government of Australia]] created the Great Barrier Reef [[Marine Park]] and defined what activities were prohibited on the Great Barrier Reef.<ref>{{cite web| author=Commonwealth of Australia| year=1975| title=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975| url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/gbrmpa1975257/index.html| accessdate=2006-08-30}}</ref>  The park is managed, in partnership with the [[Government of Queensland]], through the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to ensure that it is widely understood and used in a sustainable manner. A combination of zoning, management plans, permits, education and incentives (such as [[eco-tourism]] certification) are used in the effort to conserve the Great Barrier Reef.

In July 2004, a new zoning plan was brought into effect for the entire Marine Park, and has been widely acclaimed as a new global benchmark for the conservation of [[marine ecosystem]]s.<ref>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|year=2003|title=Zoning Plan 2003|url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/10591/Zoning_Plan.pdf|accessdate=2006-10-02}} (PDF)</ref> While protection across the Marine Park was improved, the highly protected zones increased from 4.5% to over 33.3%.<ref>{{cite web|author=World Wildlife Fund Australia|year=|title=Great Barrier Reef - WWF-Australia|url=http://www.wwf.org.au/ourwork/oceans/gbr/|accessdate=2006-11-10}}</ref>  At the time, it was the largest [[Marine Protected Area|marine protected area]] in the world, although as of 2006, the [[Northwestern Hawaiian Islands National Monument]] is the largest.<ref name=BBC_5083974>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5083974.stm Bush to protect Hawaiian islands], [[BBC News]], [[15 June]] [[2006]]</ref>

In 2006, a review was undertaken of the ''Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975''.  Some recommendations of the review are that there should be no further zoning plan changes until 2013, and that every five years, a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] Outlook Report should be published, examining the health of the Great Barrier Reef, the management of the Reef, and environmental pressures.<ref name="1975review"/>

===Tourism===
Due to its vast [[biodiversity]], warm clear waters and its accessibility from the floating guest facilities called '[[live aboard]]s', the reef is a very popular destination for tourists, especially [[scuba diving|scuba divers]].  Many cities along the Queensland coast offer boat trips to the reef on a daily basis.  Several continental islands have been turned into [[resort]]s.

As the largest commercial activity in the region, it has been estimated in 2003 that tourism in the Great Barrier Reef generates over [[Australian dollar|AU$]]4 billion annually.<ref>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|year=2003|title=Summary report of the social and economic impacts of the rezoning of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.|url=http://www.reefed.edu.au/rap/pdf/JUG_SR_09-12-03.pdf|accessdate=2006-10-19}} (PDF)</ref>  (A 2005 estimate puts the figure at [[AU$]]5.1 billion.<ref name = 2005Brochure>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|year=2005|title=Protecting Biodiversity Brochure 2005|url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/info_services/publications/brochures/index.html|accessdate=2006-11-11}}</ref>)  There are approximately two million visitors to the Great Barrier Reef each year.<ref>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|year= |title=Number of Tourists Visiting The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park| url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/key_issues/tourism/gbr_visitation/numbers|accessdate=2006-10-12}} </ref> Although most of these visits are managed in partnership with the marine [[Tourism|tourism industry]], there are some very popular areas near shore (such as [[Green Island National Park|Green Island]]) that have suffered damage due to overfishing and land based run off.
