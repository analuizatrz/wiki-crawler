The '''FairTax''' ([[Bill (proposed law)|H.R.25/S.1025]]) is a proposal in the [[United States Congress]] for changing tax laws to replace the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) and all [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] [[Income tax in the United States|income taxes]] (including [[Alternative Minimum Tax|AMT]]), [[payroll tax#United States|payroll taxes]] (including [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax|Social Security and Medicare taxes]]), [[corporate tax]]es, [[capital gains tax]]es, [[gift tax]]es, and [[Estate tax (United States)|estate taxes]] with a national retail [[sales tax]], to be levied once at the point of purchase on all new [[Good (economics)|goods]] and [[service]]s. The proposal also calls for a monthly tax rebate to [[household]]s of citizens and legal resident aliens, to "untax" purchases up to the poverty level.<ref name="Kotlikoff">{{cite web| url=http://people.bu.edu/kotlikoff/WSJ%20Op%20Ed%203-7-05.pdf| last=Kotlikoff| first=Laurence| coauthors=|title=The Case for the 'FairTax'| work=| publisher=The Wall Street Journal| date=2005-03-07| accessdate=2006-07-23}}</ref> The sales tax rate, as defined in the legislation, is 23% of the total register price (23¢ of every $1 &mdash; calculated the same way as income taxes), which is comparable to a 30% traditional [[Sales taxes in the United States|state sales tax]] (30¢ on top of every $1).<ref name="money">{{cite web| url=http://money.cnn.com/2005/09/06/pf/taxes/consumptiontax_0510/| last=Regnier| first=Pat| title=Just how fair is the FairTax?| work=| publisher=Money Magazine| date=2005-09-07| accessdate=2006-07-20}}</ref> Because the U.S. tax system has a hidden [[Effect of taxes and subsidies on price|effect on prices]],<ref name="forbes">{{cite web| url=http://www.forbes.com/opinions/2007/03/20/american-dream-taxes-oped-cz_sf_dream0307_0322dream.html | last=Forbes | first=Steve | title=The American Dream Improving Our Lot | publisher=Forbes| date=2007-03-22| accessdate=2007-03-26}}</ref> it is expected that moving to the FairTax would decrease [[production costs]] from the removal of business taxes and compliance costs, which is predicted to offset a portion of the FairTax effect on prices.<ref name="fairtaxbook">{{cite book | first=Neal | last=Boortz | coauthors=Linder, John | year=2006 | title=The Fair Tax Book | edition=Paperback | publisher=Regan Books|id=ISBN 0-06-087549-6 }}</ref>

A number of congressional committees have heard testimony on the FairTax; however, it has not been voted on in either Chamber.

==Legislative history==
The FairTax plan was created by [[Americans For Fair Taxation]], an [[advocacy group]] formed for [[tax reform]]. The group developed the plan and the name "Fair Tax" with economists based on [[interviews]], [[opinion poll|polls]], and [[focus group]]s of the general public.<ref name="ABKS">{{cite book | first=Al | last=Ose | year=2002 | title=America's Best Kept Secret Fairtax: Give Yourself a 25% Raise | edition=Paperback | publisher=Authorhouse | id=ISBN 1-4033-9189-0 }}</ref><ref name="money"/> [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[John Linder]] first introduced the FairTax bill (H.R.2525) in July 1999 to the [[106th United States Congress]]. He has reintroduced substantially the same bill in each subsequent session of Congress.

The FairTax legislation has been introduced by Linder in the House and by Georgia Republican Senator [[Saxby Chambliss]] in the Senate. Its formal name is the ''Fair Tax Act of 2007''. The legislation has been discussed with [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] and [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Henry M.

==Tax rate==
The sales tax rate, as defined in the legislation, is 23% of the total register price, which is comparable to a 30% traditional state sales tax.<ref name="money"/> The [[effective tax rate]] for any [[household]] would be variable due to the fixed monthly [[tax refund|tax rebates]] that are used to "untax" purchases up to the poverty level.<ref name="Kotlikoff"/>  The tax would be levied on all U.S. retail sales for personal consumption on new [[Good (economics)|goods]] and [[service]]s. Critics argue that the sales tax rate may not be revenue neutral, meaning it would not yield enough money for the government.<ref name="money"/> 

===Sales tax rate===
The FairTax legislation would apply a 23% federal [[Retailing|retail]] sales tax on the total transaction value of a purchase; in other words, consumers pay to the government 23 cents of every dollar spent (sometimes called ''tax-inclusive'' &mdash; as income taxes are calculated). The assessed tax rate is 30% if the FairTax is added to the pre-tax price of a good like traditional [[Sales taxes in the United States|U.S. state sales taxes]] (sometimes called ''tax-exclusive'').<ref name="money"/> The FairTax legislation uses total transaction value (tax-inclusive) in presenting the rate; with an item purchased for $100, the retailer receives $77 and the remaining is collected for the federal government. However, American sales taxes have historically been expressed as a percentage of the original sale price (tax-exclusive); items priced at $100 pre-tax cost $130 with the tax added.<ref name="ludwigvonmises">{{cite web| url=http://www.mises.org/story/1975| last=Vance| first=Laurence| title=There is No Such Thing as a Fair Tax| work=| publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute| date=2005-12-12| accessdate=2006-07-20}}</ref> The use of the tax-inclusive number in presenting the rate has been criticized as deceptive by the plan's opponents. Proponents argue that the 23% number represents a better comparison to income tax rates, which are presented as inclusive rates ''(see [[FairTax#Presentation of tax rate|Presentation of tax rate]])''.<ref name="fairtaxbook"/> Critics also argue that the sales tax rate would need to be higher in order to be revenue neutral ''(see [[FairTax#Revenue neutrality|Revenue neutrality]])''.<ref name="finalreport" />

The tax would be levied on all U.S. retail sales for personal consumption on new [[Good (economics)|goods]] and [[service]]s.  A good would be considered "used" and not taxable if a consumer already owns it before the FairTax takes effect or if the FairTax has already been paid on the good.<ref name="ABKS" /> Exports and the purchase of intermediate business sales would not be taxed, nor would [[Saving (economics)|savings]], [[Investment|financial investing]], or [[Tuition|education tuition]] expenses as they would be considered an investment (rather than final consumption).<ref name="billtext">{{cite web| title=H.R. 25: Fair Tax Act of 2007| work=110th U.S. Congress| publisher=The Library of Congress| date=2007-01-04| url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/zRetailing?c110:H.R.25:|accessdate=2007-01-14}}</ref> Personal services such as [[health care]], [[lawyer|legal services]], [[barber|haircuts]], and [[auto repairs]] would be subject to the FairTax, as would [[renting]] apartments and other [[real property]].<ref name="money"/> [[U.S. state|State]] sales taxes do not generally tax such services; however, the FairTax would use a monthly rebate system instead of the common state exclusions.  The FairTax would apply to [[Internet]] purchases and would tax retail international purchases (such as a boat or car) that are imported to the United States (collected by the [[United States Customs Service|U.S. Customs Service]]).<ref name="billtext"/>

===Effective tax rate===
[[Image:Effectiverate.png|thumb|right|400px|A graph that compares the [[effective tax rate]] of the FairTax and the current tax system.]] The [[effective tax rate]] for any [[household]] would be variable due to the fixed monthly [[tax refund|tax rebates]]. The rebates would have the greatest impact at low spending levels, where they could lower a household's effective rate to zero or a negative rate. At higher spending levels, the rebate has less impact, and a household's effective tax rate would approach 23% of total spending.<ref name="NRSACalc">{{cite web| url=http://www.salestax.org/FairTaxCalculator.htm| last=| first=| title=The FairTax Calculator| work=| publisher=National Retail Sales Tax Alliance| date=| accessdate=2006-07-23}}</ref> For example, a household of three spending $30,000 a year on taxable items would devote about 6% of total spending to the FairTax after the rebate. A household spending $125,000 on taxable items would spend around 19% on the FairTax.<ref name="money"/> The total amount of spending and the proportion of spending allocated to taxable items would determine a household's effective tax rate.<ref name="fairtaxfaq">{{cite web| url=http://www.fairtax.org/PDF/FairTaxFAQ.pdf| last=| first=| title=FairTax Frequently Asked Questions| work=| publisher=Americans For Fair Taxation| date=| accessdate=2006-10-18}}</ref>

The lowest effective tax rate under the FairTax could be negative due to the rebate. This could occur when a household spends less and pays less in taxes than the average [[Poverty in the United States#Current poverty rate and guidelines|poverty level spending]] for a similar household size. The household's rebate would exceed actual taxes paid by that household. Buying or otherwise receiving used items can also contribute towards a negative rate. 

:To determine the effective tax rate for consuming all income on new goods and services:

*Let <math>t</math> be the statutory tax rate. For a 23% rate, then <math>t = 0.23</math>

*Let <math>i</math> be the annual income.

*Let <math>r</math> be the annual rebate.

::<math>\frac{t \times i - r}{i}</math>

===Monthly tax rebate===
[[Image:FTRebate.png|thumb|right|400px|2007 FairTax prebate schedule based on poverty level spending according to the [[Poverty in the United States#Current poverty rate and guidelines|poverty guidelines]].]] Under the FairTax, households would receive a monthly tax [[Tax refund|rebate]] (known as a "prebate" as it would be paid in advance) equal to the estimated total FairTax paid on poverty level spending according to the [[Poverty in the United States#Current poverty rate and guidelines|poverty guidelines]] published by the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]].<ref name="billtext" /> The poverty level guidelines vary by family size and represent the cost to purchase household necessities. The rebate would be paid in twelve monthly installments equal to 23% of poverty level spending for each household size and is meant to eliminate the taxation of necessities and make the plan [[progressive tax|progressive]].<ref name="money" /> The formula used to calculate rebate amounts would be adjusted for [[inflation]]. To become eligible for the rebate, households would register once a year with their sales tax administering authority, providing the names and social security numbers of each household member. The [[Social Security Administration]] would disburse the monthly rebate payments in the form of a paper check via U.S. Mail, an [[electronic funds transfer]] to a bank account, or a “[[smartcard]]” that can be used much like a bank debit card.<ref name="billtext" /> The [[Beacon Hill Institute]] estimated the overall rebate cost to be $489 billion (assuming 100% participation).<ref name="taxpanelrebuttal">{{cite web| title=Rebuttal to the tax panel report and recommendations| work=| author=| publisher=Americans for Fair Taxation| date=2006-11| url=http://www.fairtax.org/PDF/Excerpts_from_response_to_tax_panel-103006.pdf| accessdate=2006-11-02}}</ref>

The [[President's Advisory Panel for Federal Tax Reform]] cited the rebate as one of their chief concerns with the FairTax, calling it "the largest (entitlement program) in American history," and contending that it would "make most American families dependent on monthly checks from the federal government for a substantial portion of their incomes."<ref name="finalreport"/> However, proponents point out that if "substantial" was defined as a rebate that increased family income by 23% or more, according to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]] income statistics for 2005, "most American families" (claimed by the Tax Panel) would only equate to 12.6%.<ref name="census bureau">{{cite web| title=Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2005| work=| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau| date=2005-08| url=http://www.census.gov/prod/2006pubs/p60-231.pdf| accessdate=2006-10-29}}</ref> Based on the advisory panel's tax rate and base (which differs from the FairTax legislation by creating exemptions not defined in the proposal),<ref name="taxpanelrebuttal" /> "the Prebate program would cost more than all budgeted spending in 2006 on the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, and Interior combined."<ref name="finalreport"/> Proponents point out that income [[tax deduction]]s, tax preferences, [[tax avoidance|loopholes]], [[tax credit|credits]], etc. under the current system was estimated at $945 billion by the [[United States Congress Joint Committee on Taxation|Joint Committee on Taxation]].<ref name="taxpanelrebuttal"/> This is $456 billion more than the FairTax "[[entitlement]]" ([[tax refund]]) would spend to cover each person's tax expenses up to the poverty level.

===Revenue neutrality===
[[Image:TaxbaseStability.png|thumb|right|400px|Stability of the Tax Base: A comparison of [[Personal Consumption Expenditure]]s and [[Adjusted Gross Income]].]]
A key component of the FairTax rate is the ability to be revenue-neutral; that is, it would not result in an increase or reduction in overall federal tax revenues.<ref name="ABKS"/> However, economists, advisory groups, and political advocacy groups disagree about the tax rate required for the FairTax to be truly revenue-neutral. Different researchers use different time frames and methodologies that make direct comparison among estimates difficult. The choice between [[Static analysis|static]] or [[dynamic scoring]] further complicates any estimate of revenue-neutral rates.<ref name="scoring">{{cite web| url=http://www.ipi.org/ipi/IPIPressReleases.nsf/0/34899156780cc5fe85257088005d0294?OpenDocument| last=Gingrich| first=Newt| coauthors=Ferrara, Peter |title=Doesn't Anyone Know the Score?| work=Institute for Policy Innovation| publisher=Wall Street Journal| date=2005-09-26| accessdate=2006-07-20}}</ref> The rates presented below are based on a static scoring analysis and adhere to the legislative framework of the FairTax bill in rate presentation, which is calculated as a percentage of total spending, sometimes called a tax-inclusive rate. To adjust any rate below to that of a traditional state sales tax, divide the rate by 1 minus the rate ''(refer to [[FairTax#Presentation of tax rate|Presentation of tax rate]] for calculations)''. 

[[Americans For Fair Taxation]] (AFFT) states that [[Dale W. Jorgenson|Dale Jorgenson]], a professor of economics at [[Harvard University]] and past President of the [[American Economic Association]], estimated the revenue-neutral rate to be 22.9%.<ref name="ABKS" /> However, Dr. Jorgenson, in his 2002 book, indicated that he believes the revenue-neutral rate would need to be much higher (it is unknown what assumptions, changes, or tax base he was considering when he made this statement).<ref name="Jorgensonbook">{{cite book | first=Dale | last=Jorgenson | coauthors=Yun, Kun-Young| year=2002| title=Investment, Vol. 3: Lifting the Burden: Tax Reform, the Cost of Capital, and U.S. Economic Growth| edition=Hardcover|publisher=The MIT Press| id=ISBN 0-262-10091-6 }}</ref> Jim Poterba of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] estimated a rate of 23.1% using assumptions provided to him by AFFT. [[Laurence Kotlikoff]] of [[Boston University]] purportedly found a rate of around 24%. AFFT states that researchers at [[Stanford University]], The [[Heritage Foundation]], The [[Cato Institute]], and Fiscal Associates have calculated revenue-neutral rates between 22.3% and 24%.<ref name="ABKS" /> However, AFFT funded this research and has not made these studies public. The studies are also not published by the economists that conducted those studies.

Additional studies have been performed on national retail sales tax plans that do not necessarily conform to the tax base as defined in the FairTax legislation but are often considered when discussing FairTax rates.

Paulson]], stated in 2006 that he would investigate the FairTax in a very comprehensive way using resources outside the Treasury.<ref name="ConfCall"/>

===Presentation of tax rate===
Sales and income taxes behave differently due to differing definitions of tax base, which can make comparisons between the two confusing. For direct rate comparisons between sales and income taxes, one rate must be manipulated to look like the other. A 30% sales tax rate approximates a 23% income tax rate after adjustment.  The current U.S. tax system imposes taxes primarily on [[income]]. The tax base is a household's pre-tax income. The appropriate income tax rate is applied to the tax base to calculate taxes owed. Under this formula, taxes to be paid are included in the base on which the tax rate is imposed. If an individual's gross income is $100 and income tax rate is 23%, taxes owed equals $23. The tax base of $100 can be treated as two parts &mdash; $77 of after-tax spending money and $23 of income taxes owed. The income tax is taken "off the top", so the individual is left with $77 in after-tax money.<ref name="ABKS" /> Traditional sales tax laws impose taxes on a tax base equal to the pre-tax portion of a good's price. Unlike income taxes, U.S. sales taxes do not include actual taxes owed as part of the base. A good priced at $77 with a 30% sales tax rate yields $23 in taxes owed. Since the sales tax is added "on the top", the individual pays $23 of tax on $77 of pre-tax goods.<ref name="ABKS" />  By including taxes owed in the tax base, a sales tax rate can be directly compared to an income tax rate.

The FairTax rate, unlike most U.S. [[Sales taxes in the United States|state-level sales taxes]], is calculated on a tax base that includes the amount of FairTax paid. In this manner, the FairTax, like [[Europe|European]] sales taxes, more closely resembles an income tax calculation. A final price of $100 includes $23 of taxes. Like the income tax example above, the taxes to be paid would be included in the base on which the FairTax is imposed. The FairTax is presented as a 23% tax rate for easy comparison to income tax rates (the taxes it would be replacing). If you are in a 25% income tax bracket, you will pay $25 in federal income taxes out every $100 you earn. With the 23% FairTax, you would pay $23 in taxes out of every $100 you spend.<ref name="fairtaxbook" /> The plan's opponents call this deceptive &mdash; Laurence Vance, writing for the [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], goes so far as to call it a "lie".<ref name="ludwigvonmises" /> When looking at other rate studies that report a 36% rate, the equivalent traditional sales tax rate would be 56%.

:Comparison to a typical sales rate:

*Let <math>t</math> be the FairTax rate. For a 23% rate, then <math>t = 0.23</math>

*Let <math>a</math> be the rate in terms of a typical sales tax.

*Let <math>p</math> be the price of the good (including the tax).

:The revenue that would go to the government:

::<math>t \times p</math>

:The revenue remaining for the seller of the good:

::<math>p - t \times p</math>

:To convert the tax, divide the money going to the government by the money the company nets:

::<math>a = \frac{t \times p}{p - t \times p} = \frac{t}{1 - t}</math>

:Therefore, to adjust any rate below to that of a traditional sales tax, divide the given rate by 1 minus that rate.

==Distribution of tax burden==
{{main|Distribution of the FairTax burden}}
[[Image:FairTax married.png|right|thumb|400px|[[Boston University]] study of the FairTax, Average Remaining Federal Lifetime Tax Rates of married households.]]
The FairTax's impact on the distribution of taxation or [[tax incidence]] (the effect on the distribution of [[Welfare economics|economic welfare]]) is a point of dispute. The plan's supporters argue that it would broaden the tax base, be [[progressive tax|progressive]], decrease tax burdens, and start taxing [[wealth]], while opponents argue that a national sales tax would be inherently [[regressive tax|regressive]] and would decrease tax burdens paid by high-income individuals.<ref name="money"/> Sales taxes are normally considered regressive; however, the FairTax provides a [[tax refund|rebate]] that supporters argue would create a progressive [[effective rate]] on [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]. Under the FairTax, a low-income family may spend $25,000 on goods and services consuming 100% of their income. A higher income family making $100,000 may spend $80,000 on goods and services and save $20,000. The higher income family is consuming only 80% of their income on taxable goods and services. According to Economist [[William G. Gale]], the percentage of income taxed is regressive (using a cross-section time frame).<ref name="wgale">{{cite web| url=http://www.brookings.edu/comm/policybriefs/pb31.htm| last=Gale| first=William| coauthors=|title=Don't Buy the Sales Tax| work=| publisher=The Brookings Institution| date=1998-03| accessdate=2006-07-23}}</ref> However, when presented with an estimated effective tax rate, the low-income family above would pay a tax rate of 0% on the 100% of consumption and the higher income family would pay a tax rate of 15% on the 80% of consumption. The effective tax rate is progressive on consumption.<ref name="Kotlikoff" />

[[Household]]s at the lower end of the income scale spend almost all their income, while households at the higher end are more likely to devote a portion of income to saving; households at the extreme high end of consumption often finance their purchases out of savings, not income.<ref name="wgale" /> These savings would be taxed when they become purchases. Income earned and saved would not be taxed immediately under the proposal. In other words, savings would be spent at some point in the future and taxed according to that consumption. FairTax advocates state that this would improve taxing of wealth. Economist [[Laurence Kotlikoff]] states that the FairTax could make the tax system much more progressive and generationally equitable.<ref name="Kotlikoff" /> "Their view that taxing sales is regressive is just plain wrong. Taxing consumption is effectively the same as taxing [[wage]]s plus taxing wealth."<ref name="Kotlikoff" /> Kotlikoff finds that the FairTax significantly reduces [[marginal tax rate|marginal taxes]] on work and saving, which substantially lowers overall average remaining lifetime [[Tax incidence|tax burdens]] on current and future workers at all income levels.<ref name="comparerates"/> 

The [[President's Advisory Panel for Federal Tax Reform]] and Economist William Gale analyzed a National Sales Tax similar to the FairTax (though also different in several aspects) and reported that the overall tax burden on middle-income Americans would increase while the tax burden on the very rich would drop.<ref name="finalreport" /><ref name="wgale"/> According to the tax panel report, the percentage of federal taxes paid by those earning from $15,000 &ndash; $50,000 would rise from 3.6% to 6.7%, while the burden on those earning more than $200,000 would fall from 53.5% to 45.9%.<ref name="finalreport" /> FairTax supporters argue that the tax burden would shift to those who do not pay taxes under the current system.<ref name="Kotlikoff"/> The FairTax would dramatically broaden the tax base to include all 300 million Americans and an estimated 30 million to 40 million foreign tourists and visitors. This would more than double the federal government's tax base ($11.467 trillion compared with $9.706 trillion of taxable income).<ref name="revisetaxlaw">{{cite web| url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/op-ed/20050926-092834-5516r.htm| last=Chambliss| first=Saxby| coauthors=Linder, John; King, Steve; Brady, Kevin|title=Revise the tax law| work=| publisher=The Washington Times| date=2005-09-27| accessdate=2006-07-23}}</ref><ref name="TaxComparisonChart"/> A study on marginal and average tax rates found that the FairTax would reduce most households’ average lifetime tax rates and, often, by a lot.<ref name="Kotlikoff2">{{cite web| url=http://people.bu.edu/kotlikoff/w11831.pdf| last=Kotlikoff| first=Laurence| coauthors=Rapson, David|title=Would the FairTax Raise or Lower Marginal and Average Tax Rates| work=| publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research| date=2005-12| accessdate=2006-10-10}}</ref> Economists at [[Boston University]] found that the FairTax rewards low-income households with 26.7% more [[purchasing power]], middle-income households with 10.9% more purchasing power, and high-income households with 4.7% more purchasing power.<ref name="dynamiceffects"/>

==Predicted effects==
{{main|Predicted effects of the FairTax}}
Many mainstream economists and tax experts believe [[consumption tax]]es, such as the FairTax, would have a positive impact on [[economic growth]], incentives for [[international business]] to locate in the U.S., and increased U.S. international competitiveness (border tax adjustment in [[International trade|global trade]]).<ref name="money"/><ref name="fairtaxbook"/><ref name="endorsement"/>  The plan is expected to have advantages with taxing [[Crime|illegal activity]], taxing [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigrants]], and cost transparency for funding the federal government.<ref name="fairtaxbook"/> The FairTax would be essentially [[Tax-free shopping|tax-free]] on [[Mortgage loan|mortgage interest]] and [[donation]]s; however, some law makers have concerns about losing [[Social engineering (political science)|social incentives]] on [[home ownership]] and [[Charitable organization|charitable contributions]]. There is also concern about the impact to the income tax industry and the difficulty with permanently eliminating income taxation, as it would require a [[constitutional amendment]].<ref name="fairtaxfaq"/>

The FairTax proposal would have effects in many areas that influence the United States. FairTax proponents assert that the proposal would provide tax burden visibility and reduce compliance costs.

===Transition effects===
If the FairTax bill were passed, permanent elimination of income taxation would not be guaranteed; the FairTax bill would repeal much of the existing [[Internal Revenue Code|tax code]], but the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]] would remain in place. The elimination of the possibility that income taxation would return (through a separate Congressional bill), requires a repeal of the Sixteenth Amendment to the [[United States Constitution]] along with expressly prohibiting an income tax.<ref name="fairtaxfaq" /> This is referred to as an "aggressive repeal". Separate income taxes enforced by the State would be unaffected by the federal repeal. Since passing the FairTax would only require a simple majority in each house of [[Congress]] along with the signature of the [[President]], and enactment of a [[constitutional amendment]] must be approved by two thirds of each house of [[Congress]], and three quarters of the individual [[U.S. states]], it is possible that passage of the FairTax bill would simply add another [[taxation]] system. If a new income tax bill was passed after the FairTax passage, a [[hybrid]] system could develop. However, there is nothing preventing the addition of a national sales tax, or VAT tax, on top of today's income tax system. The [[Americans For Fair Taxation]] plan is to first pass the FairTax and then to focus grassroots efforts on [[Joint resolution|HJR]] 16, that calls for the repeal of the Sixteenth Amendment.<ref name="fairtaxfaq" /><ref name="HJR16">{{cite web| url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:h.j.res.00016:|title=H.

Individuals under the current system who accumulated savings from ordinary income (by choosing not to spend their money when the income was earned) paid taxes on that income before it was placed in savings. When individuals spend above the poverty level with money saved under the current system, that spending would be subject to the FairTax. People living through the transition may find both their earnings and their spending taxed. Supporters of the plan argue that the current system is no different, since compliance costs and "hidden taxes" embedded in the prices of goods and services cause savings to be "taxed" a second time already when spent. The rebates would supplement accrued savings, covering taxes up to the poverty level.<ref name="ABKS"/> The income taxes on capital gains, social security and pension benefits would be eliminated under FairTax. The FairTax would also eliminate what some claim to be the double taxation on savings that is part of [[Estate tax (United States)|estate taxes]]. In addition, the FairTax legislation adjusts [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] benefits for changes in the price level, so a percentage increase in prices would result in an equal percentage increase to Social Security income.<ref name="billtext"/> Supporters suggest these changes would offset paying the FairTax under transition conditions.<ref name="fairtaxbook" />

During the transition, many or most of the employees of the IRS (105,978 in 2005)<ref name="irslabor">{{cite web| url=http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/05db33ps.xls| last=| first=| title=IRS Labor Force, Compared to National Totals for Civilian and Federal[[Image:Excel 2003.png|18px]]| work=| publisher=Internal Revenue Service| date=2005| accessdate=2006-11-18}}</ref> would face loss of employment.<ref name="beaconhill"/> The Beacon Hill Institute estimate is that the federal government would be able to cut $8 billion from the IRS budget of $11.01 billion (in 2007), reducing the size of federal tax administration by 73%.<ref name="beaconhill"/> In addition, income tax preparers (many seasonal), tax lawyers, CPAs, tax compliance staff in medium-to-large businesses, and software companies which sell tax preparation software (such as Drake Software, [[H&R Block|TaxCut]], and [[Intuit Inc.#TurboTax|TurboTax]]), could face significant drops, changes, or loss of employment.<ref name="fairtaxfaq"/> However, IRS testimony from 2004 stated that 45% of revenue agents and officers would become eligible for retirement in the following 5 years and there is concern about the loss of their work force as their hiring efforts struggle to keep pace with attrition.<ref name="irstestimony">{{cite web| url=http://www.ustreas.gov/tigta/congress/congress_07212004.htm| last=Gardiner| first=Pamela| title=Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration Testimony| work=| publisher=U.S. Senate Committee on Finanace| date=2004-7-21| accessdate=2006-11-18}}</ref> In addition, the IRS would not go completely out of commission until 3 years after the FairTax was enacted, providing employees time to find other employment.<ref name="billtext"/> Proponents claim the projected 10.5% growth in the economy during the first year of the FairTax would provide plenty of new jobs to these workers that are typically well educated and well equipped with transferable skills.<ref name="fairtaxfaq"/> In the period before the FairTax was implemented, there could be a strong incentive for individuals to buy goods without the sales tax using credit. After the FairTax was in effect, the credit could be paid off using untaxed payroll.

===Other indirect effects===
The current federal [[tax law]] allows individuals to deduct the home [[Mortgage loan|mortgage interest]] costs, and [[donation]]s to certain [[Charitable organization|charities]], from [[taxable income]]. Someone paying a 25% income tax rate would pay $250 in taxes on a $1,000 donation or mortgage interest payment, and then receive $250 back from the government as the $1000 deduction is removed from taxable income.<ref name="publication936">{{cite web| url=http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p936.pdf| title=Publication 936| publisher=Internal Revenue Service| date=2005|accessdate=2006-11-13}}</ref> The FairTax is tax free on mortgage interest up to the basic [[interest rate]] as determined by the [[Federal Reserve]] and donations are not taxed.<ref name="billtext" /> The FairTax may also affect State and local government debt as the federal income tax system provides tax advantages to state and local [[municipal bond]]s.<ref name="bonds">{{cite web| url=http://bonds.yahoo.com/sm_bd5.html| last=| first=| title=Types of Bonds| work=SmartMoney.com| publisher=Yahoo Finance| date=| accessdate=2006-07-24}}</ref> Other areas affected may be law enforcement as avoidance of income tax is sometimes used to prosecute members of [[organized crime]] syndicates to convict on charges of [[tax avoidance and tax evasion]] when insufficient direct evidence exists for other crimes. Under the FairTax proposal, this avenue of law enforcement would disappear as there would be no income tax and, therefore, no income tax evasion. Instead of being guilty of income tax evasion, they would be guilty of failing to submit sales tax. Advocates claim the FairTax would provide incentive for [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigrants]] to [[Immigration to the United States|legalize]] as they would otherwise not receive the FairTax rebate.<ref name="fairtaxbook" /> Illegal immigrants would pay the maximum effective tax rate.<ref name="billtext" /> There would also be no federal tax savings to companies that hire illegal immigrants.

==Changes in the retail economy==
Since the FairTax would not tax used goods, the value would be determined by the [[supply and demand]] in relation to new goods.<ref name="pricetheory"/> The price differential / margins between used and new goods would stay consistent, as the cost and value of used goods are in direct relationship to the cost and value of the new goods.  Because the U.S. tax system has a hidden [[Effect of taxes and subsidies on price|effect on prices]], it is expected that moving to the FairTax would decrease production costs from the removal of business taxes and compliance costs, which is predicted to offset a portion of the FairTax effect on prices.<ref name="fairtaxbook"/>
===Value of used goods===
Since the FairTax would not tax used goods, there is a common misunderstanding that this would create a differential, equal to the FairTax, between the price of new and used goods. Such a differential would certainly impact the sale of new goods like vehicles and homes. However, like the income tax system that contains embedded tax cost ''(see [[FairTax#Theories of retail pricing|Theories of retail pricing]])'',<ref name="forbes"/> used goods would contain the embedded FairTax cost. While the FairTax would not be applied to the retail sales of used goods, the inherent value of a used good includes the taxes paid when the good was sold at retail. The value is determined by the [[supply and demand]] in relation to new goods.<ref name="pricetheory">{{cite book | first=Steven | last=Landsburg | year=1998 | title=Price Theory and Applications | edition=4th edition (Hardcover) | publisher=South-Western Educational Publishing|id=ISBN 0-538-88206-9 }}</ref> The price differential / margins between used and new goods would stay consistent, as the cost and value of used goods are in direct relationship to the cost and value of the new goods.

===Theories of retail pricing===
[[Image:tax_supply_and_demand.png|thumbnail|200px|left|Standard [[supply and demand]] diagram illustrating taxes effect on prices.]] Retail prices are inflated due to [[Effect of taxes and subsidies on price|embedded taxes]] and compliance costs passed to the consumer by producers and suppliers.<ref name="forbes"/> John Linder states the FairTax would eliminate almost all federal taxation costs from the [[supply chain]], which could lower production costs by up to 30%.<ref name="lindersite"/> Americans For Fair Taxation has claimed that the [[production cost]] of domestic goods and services could decrease by approximately 22% on average after embedded taxes and compliance costs were removed, leaving the sale nearly the same after taxes.<ref name="fairtaxfaq"/> This is based on a study conducted by Dr. [[Dale W. Jorgenson|Dale Jorgenson]], who found that producer prices would drop between 15% and 26% (depending on the type of good/service) after the switch to a consumption based tax.<ref name="fairtaxbook" /> However, Jorgenson's research included all income and payroll taxes regardless of whether they were paid by employees or employers in the 22% embedded tax estimation. (It is also important to note that the Jorgenson model did not capture any reduction in the cost of compliance associated with changing from a complex income tax system to a simpler consumption tax.) This means that Jorgenson assumed that businesses would pass on all the cost savings from the repeal of payroll taxes and income tax withholding to consumers in the form of lower prices. Mathematically, this would have to result in employee take-home pay ([[net income]]) remaining unchanged from pre-FairTax levels.<ref name="money" /><ref name="boortzconfusion">{{cite web| url=http://boortz.com/nuze/200509/09152005.html#fairtax| last=Boortz| first=Neal| title=The FairTax - Straightening out some confusion| work=| publisher=Cox Radio| date=2005-09-15| accessdate=2006-08-04}}</ref> 

If businesses instead provided employees with their [[gross income|gross pay]] as expected (including income tax withholding and the employee share of payroll taxes),<ref name="beaconhill"/> Arduin, Laffer & Moore Econometrics estimated production costs would decrease by a minimum of 11.55%.<ref name="ALME"/> This decrease would offset a portion of the FairTax amount reflected in retail prices. These embedded costs include corporate taxes, compliance costs, and the employer share of payroll taxes ''(see [[FairTax#Effect on tax compliance costs|Effect on tax compliance costs]])''. The Beacon Hill Institute shows that it would not matter whether prices fall or rise &mdash; the relative tax burden remains the same because if prices increased with the addition of the FairTax, wages would also rise accordingly; or if the federal reserve did not decide to accommodate (does not increase the [[money supply]]), then prices would fall and wages would remain at their net rates. Purchasing power for buying consumer goods and services in either situation would remain essentially the same, and the FairTax rate would be the same.<ref name="beaconhill"/>

The decrease in production cost would only slightly apply to imported products, so, according to proponents, it would provide tax advantages for domestic production and increase U.S. competitiveness in global trade ''(see [[Predicted effects of the FairTax#Border adjustability|Border adjustability]])''. Such logic is endorsed by a recent letter to the commission on tax reform by dozens of economists, including [[Nobel Laureate]] [[Vernon L. Smith]].<ref name="endorsement" /> A study prepared by Nathan Associates for the [[National Retail Federation]], which made many adverse assumptions, represents supporters' worst-case scenario for a [[consumption tax]]. The study predicts that the economy will grow only 3% more in ten years than it would have under the income tax and that the increase in consumption will be 1.15% less in the first year relative to what it would have been under the income tax. This study concludes that consumption will be higher in the fourth year and every year thereafter than it would have been under the income tax.<ref name="whitepaper">{{cite web| url=http://www.fairtax.org/pdfs/Why_retailers.pdf| last=| first=| title=Why retailers should support the FairTax| work=| publisher=Americans For Fair Taxation| date=| accessdate=2006-07-24}}</ref>

==Effects on tax code compliance==
FairTax supporters state that [[black market]] or illegal economic activity is largely untaxed under the current tax system. Economists estimate the [[underground economy]] in the United States to be between one and three trillion dollars annually.<ref name="Newnan"/><ref name="shadow">{{cite web| url=http://wsjclassroom.com/archive/05apr/econ_underground.htm| last=McTague| first=Jim| title=The Underground Economy| work=Barron's| publisher=The Wall Street Journal Classroom Edition| date=2005-04| accessdate=2006-07-25}}</ref><ref name="madness">{{cite book|last=Schlosser|first=Eric|title=Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market|publisher=Mariner Books|edition=Reprint|date=2004-04-01|isbn=978-0618446704}}</ref> By imposing a sales tax, black market activity would be significantly taxed when proceeds from such activity are spent on legal consumption. For example, the sale of [[illegal narcotic]]s would remain untaxed (instead of being guilty of income tax evasion, dealers would be guilty of failing to submit sales tax), but drug dealers would face taxation when they used drug proceeds to buy consumer goods such as food, clothing, and cars. By taxing this previously untaxed money, FairTax supporters state the black market would be paying part of their share of what would otherwise be uncollected income and payroll taxes.<ref name="fairtaxbook" />

[[Microeconomist]] [[Mike Moffatt]] argued that if there were no net change in retail prices or tax burdens, the licit consumption of goods and services by the underground economy would continue to bear the same tax burden as before. Legal purchases under the current tax regime carry the hidden cost of implicit taxes. When an explicit tax replaces those taxes, the consumption purchases would still bear the same tax burden.<ref name="quandry">{{cite web| url=http://economics.about.com/od/thefairtaxproposal/a/fairtax_quand.htm| last=Moffatt| first=Mike| title=FairTax Quandry| work=| publisher=About, Inc| date=2006| accessdate=2006-09-06}}</ref> However, the cost paid by the underground economy through embedded taxes is the cost associated with those paying into the income tax base. If black market activity was taxed today, the tax burden on the rest of the population would decrease from the larger base. Likewise, the large base of consumption would have illegal activity paying into the FairTax base. 

===Tax compliance===
[[Image:CROSSNG.JPG|thumb|right|250px|"No, No! Not That Way" &mdash; [[Political cartoon]] from [[1933]] commenting on a general [[sales tax]] over an [[income tax]].]]
The current income tax system fails to collect on a significant percentage of taxes. The IRS estimates twenty additional cents of taxes are owed on unreported income for every tax dollar collected. In 2001, the IRS estimated this shortfall to be over $312 billion.<ref name="economist">{{cite web| url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=3860731| last=| first=| title=Simplifying tax systems: The case for flat taxes| work=Barron's| publisher=The Economist| date=2005-04-14| accessdate=2006-07-25}}</ref> These figures do not include taxes lost on illicit sources of income, such as illegal drug dealing. Proponents assert that the transparency and simplicity of the FairTax would subject much of this unreported income to taxation. The number of tax collection points would significantly reduce under the FairTax, as only retailers would file a tax return compared to every income earner. The FairTax would reduce the number of tax filers by about 80% (from 145 million to 25 million) and reduce the filing complexity to a simplified state sales tax form.<ref name="taxfilers">{{cite web| url=http://www.fairtax.org/PDF/WhatTheFederalTaxSystemIsCostingYou.pdf| last=| first=| title=What the federal tax system is costing you – besides your taxes!| work=| publisher=Americans For Fair Taxation| date=2007-02-19| accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref><ref name="lindersite"/> 

Research supports the claim that simplified tax systems lead to greater compliance. The [[International Monetary Fund]] found that Russia's transition to a flat tax increased income reporting from 52% to 68% in one year. Similar results have occurred in Slovenia.<ref name="economist" /> The [[Government Accountability Office]], among others, have specifically identified the negative relationship between compliance and the number of focal points for collection. The federal government would be able to concentrate its entire tax enforcement efforts on a single tax &mdash; the FairTax. Retailers would receive 1/4 of 1% as compensation for compliance costs.<ref name="billtext"/> In addition, the overwhelming majority of purchases occur in major retail outlets, which are very unlikely to evade the FairTax and risk losing their business licenses.<ref name="beaconhill"/> Economic figures show that 47% of all retail sales are made by just 688 businesses ([[Big-box store|"Big-Box" retailers]]). 87% of retail sales are made by 193,000 businesses, which is 3.7% of U.S. businesses.<ref name="Newnan">{{cite web|url=http://www.fairtax.org/news/events.aspx?eventid=9|title=Rep. John Linder updates volunteers |publisher=Americans For Fair Taxation|last=Linder|first=John|date=2007-01-30|accessdate=2007-02-04}}</ref>

FairTax opponents believe that compliance decreases when taxes are not [[Tax withholding in the United States|automatically withheld]] from citizens. Compliance rates also fall when taxed entities, rather than a third party, self-report their tax liability. For example, ordinary personal income taxes can be automatically withheld and are reported to the government by a third party. Taxes without withholding and with self-reporting, such as the FairTax, can see evasion rates of 30% or more. William Gale has estimated that an evasion rate of 20% would require a FairTax rate of 39% to replace revenue lost through evasion.<ref name="taxnotes" /><ref name="galerebutal" /> This would be a 65% rate when presented as a traditional sales tax.

The FairTax is a national tax, but can be administered by the states rather than a federal agency.<ref name="billtext"/> This has a bearing on compliance, as the states' own agencies could monitor and audit businesses within that state. The .25% retained by the states amounts to 5 billion dollars the states would have available for enforcement and administration. For example, California should receive over $500 million for enforcement. According to the California 2004-05 budget analysis, this is more than the $327 million California is spending to enforce the state's more complex sales and excise taxes.<ref name="LAO">{{cite web| url=http://www.lao.ca.gov/analysis_2004/general_govt/gen_09_0860_anl04.htm| last=| first=| title=California Sales Tax Enforcement Costs - Analysis of the 2004-05 Budget Bill| work=| publisher=Legislative Analyst's Office| date=2004-02| accessdate=2006-07-25}}</ref> The FairTax is simpler, but extends to cover services which are not currently subject to the California sales tax. Because the federal money paid to the states would be a percentage of the total revenue collected, the states would have an incentive to maximize collections.<ref name="fairtaxbook"/>

[[University of Michigan]] economist Joel Slemrod argues that states would face significant issues in enforcing the tax. "Even at an average rate of around 5 percent, state sales taxes are difficult to administer. Apparently the authors (of the FairTax) have not talked much to administrators who have to deal with, among other things, ineligible people declaring themselves to be businesses to qualify for the business exemption."<ref name="nyreview">{{cite web| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/13/books/review/13slemrod.html?ei=5088&en=adb65ce66e79b77f&ex=1289538000&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&pagewanted=print| last=Slemrod| first=Joel| title='The Fairtax Book' and 'Flat Tax Revolution': 1040EZ — Really, Really EZ| work=| publisher=New York Times| date=2005-11-13| accessdate=2006-07-25}}</ref> However, this statement is based on the understanding of state sales taxes, which differs from what would be allowed for personal and business purchases under the FairTax ''(see [[FairTax#Personal vs. business purchases|Personal vs. business purchases]])''. States that choose to conform to the federal tax base would have advantages in enforcement, information sharing, and clear interstate revenue allocation rules.<ref name="billtext"/><ref name="states">{{cite web|url=http://fairtax.org/PDF/TheFairTaxWhatsInItForTheStates.pdf|title=The FairTax: What’s in it for the states?|publisher=Americans For Fair Taxation|accessdate=2007-01-29}}</ref> Similar to administer VAT taxes have an average rate of 20% with 14 countries having a rate of 20% or more.<ref name="taxpanelrebuttal"/>

===Underground economy===
Opponents of FairTax argue that imposing a national retail sales tax would drive transactions underground and create a vast [[underground economy]].<ref name="money"/><ref name="NSTv.VAT">{{cite web| url=http://www.jpfo.org/fairtax.htm| last=Franks| first=Dale| coauthors=| title=The NST v. the VAT| work=| publisher=QandO| date=2004-12-08| accessdate=2006-08-12}}</ref> Under a retail sales tax system, the purchase of intermediate goods would not always be taxed, since those goods would produce a retail good that will be taxed. Individuals and businesses may be able to manipulate the tax system by claiming that purchases are for intermediate goods, when in fact they are final purchases that should be taxed. Proponents point out that a business is required to have a registered seller's certificate on file, and must keep complete records of all transactions for 6 years. Businesses must also record all taxable goods bought for 7 years. They are required to report these sales every month ''(see [[FairTax#Personal vs. business purchases|Personal vs. business purchases]])''.<ref name="billtext"/>

While the superiority of consumption taxes is evident to many economists and tax experts, problems could arise with using a retail sales tax rather than a [[value added tax]] (VAT).<ref name="money"/> A VAT imposes a tax at every intermediate step of production, so the goods reach the final consumer with much of the tax already in the price, along with some extra overhead. The retail seller has little incentive to conceal [[retail]] sales, since he has already paid much of the good's tax. Retailers are unlikely to subsidize the consumer's tax evasion by concealing sales. In contrast, a retailer has paid no tax on goods under a sales tax system. This provides an incentive for retailers to conceal sales and engage in "tax [[arbitrage]]" by sharing some of the illicit tax savings with the final consumer.<ref name="VAT">{{cite web| url=http://qando.net/details.aspx?Entry=2443| last=Franks| first=Dale| title=Fair Tax Supporters: Whistling Past the Graveyard| work=| publisher=QandO| date=2005-08-25| accessdate=2006-07-25}}</ref>

In the United States, a general sales tax is imposed in 45 states plus the District of Columbia (accounting for over 97% of both population and economic output). Most states also collect a variety of local sales taxes including county, city, and transit taxes.<ref name="SalesTaxFAQ">{{cite web| url=http://www.salestaxinstitute.com/sales-tax-faq.jsp| last=| first=| title=Sales Tax FAQ| work=| publisher=Sales Tax Institute| date=| accessdate=2006-08-11}}</ref> The United States has a large infrastructure for taxing sales that many countries do not have. Proponents respond to the underground economy argument by pointing out that, whereas tax evasion under the current income tax system requires only one person (the payer) to lie on their tax forms, tax evasion under the FairTax requires collusion of both the payer (the retail purchaser) and the payee (the retail seller). Furthermore, the number of individuals required to file taxes drops from approximately 145 million to 25 million, a drop in excess of 80%. This drop in the number of collection points will allow the tax administration to view tax fraud with greater scrutiny.<ref name="taxfilers" /> Proponents of the FairTax see a substantial amount of additional tax revenue from those engaging in the black market, as a sales tax would require all who consume to be taxed ''(see [[FairTax#Effects on tax code compliance|Effects on tax code compliance]])''.

===Personal vs. business purchases===
In order for an individual to purchase items tax-free for business purposes, the business would be required to be a registered seller with the state sales tax authority, and thereby be subject to audit. The state would issue the business a registered seller's certificate. This would enable the business to purchase tax free from [[wholesale]] [[vendors]], but they must give a copy of their registration certificate to the vendor to leave an [[audit]] trail.<ref name="billtext"/> When an item is purchased for business use from a [[retail]] vendor, the business would have to pay the tax on the purchase and take a credit against the tax due on their sales tax return. Taxable property and services purchased by a qualified non-profit or religious organization 'for business purposes' would not be taxable.<ref name="nonprofit">{{cite web| url=http://www.fairtax.org/pdfs/religious_giving.pdf| last=| first=| title=The impact of the FairTax on religious and other charitable giving| work=| publisher=Americans For Fair Taxation| date=| accessdate=2006-08-13}}</ref>

Businesses would be required to submit monthly or quarterly reports (depending on sales volume) of taxable sales and sales tax collected on their monthly sales tax return.<ref name="ABKS" /> During audits, the business would have to produce [[invoice]]s for the "business purchases" that they did not pay sales tax on, and would have to be able to show that they were genuine business expenses.<ref name="billtext"/> Since 145 million individuals would no longer be filing tax returns, there would only be about 25 million businesses that could be audited.<ref name="taxfilers" /> Advocates claim that this would greatly increase the likelihood of business audits, making tax evasion behavior much more risky. Additionally, the FairTax legislation has several fines and penalties for non-compliance and authorizes a mechanism for reporting tax cheats and obtaining a reward.<ref name="billtext"/> To prevent businesses from purchasing everything for their employees, in a family business for example, goods and services bought by the business for the employees that are not strictly for business use would be taxable.<ref name="billtext"/> [[Health insurance]] or [[medical]] expenses would be an example where the business would have to pay the FairTax on these purchases.

==Grassroots movement==
[[Image:Orlandotaxrallypic1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Grassroots]] supporters organize in [[Orlando, Florida]] for a FairTax [[Demonstration (people)|Rally]] on [[July 28]], [[2006]].]] The origins of the [[grassroots]] began in 1990 with a group called [[Citizens for an Alternative Tax System]] (CATS) and has grown into a large [[tax reform]] [[Political movement|movement]].<ref name="movement">{{cite web|url=http://waysandmeans.house.gov/hearings.asp?formmode=view&id=4429 |title=Committee on Ways and Means Hearing -Statement of Leo Linbeck| publisher=Committee on Ways and Means|date=2005|accessdate=2007-01-25}}</ref> CATS garnered the attention of a group of businessmen from [[Houston, Texas]], who then went on to initially finance what has become the [[non-partisan]] [[advocacy group|political advocacy group]] [[Americans For Fair Taxation]] (AFFT).<ref name="movement"/> This [[organization]] claims to have spent over $20 million in research, marketing, lobbying, and organizing efforts over a ten year period and is seeking to raise over $100 million more to promote the plan. AFFT includes a staff in Houston and a large group of [[volunteer]]s who are working to get the FairTax enacted.<ref name="ABKS"/> The internet, [[blogsphere]], and [[electronic mailing lists]] like [[Yahoo! Groups]] have contributed to informing, organizing, and gaining support for the FairTax. Many [[Americans For Fair Taxation#Grassroots sites|grassroots web sites]] have been created by supporters to help organize the effort and promote the plan. Much support has been achieved by [[talk radio]] personality [[Neal Boortz]]. Boortz's book (co-authored by Georgia Congressman [[John Linder]]) entitled ''[[The FairTax Book]]'', explains the proposal and spent time atop the ''[[New York Times]]'' bestseller list. Boortz stated that he donates his share of the proceeds to [[Charitable organization|charity]] to promote the book.<ref name="boortzbook">{{cite web| url=http://boortz.com/nuze/200509/09202005.html| last=Boortz| first=Neal| title=Nealz Nuze|work=| publisher=Cox Radio| date=2005-09-07| accessdate=2006-08-07}}</ref> In addition, Boortz and Linder have organized several FairTax [[Demonstration (people)|rallies]] to publicize support for the plan.
