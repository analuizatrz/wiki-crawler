'''Kevin Spacey''' (born [[July 26]], [[1959]]) is an [[United States|American]] actor ([[film]] and [[theatre|stage]]) and director. Spacey grew up in [[California]], and began his career as a [[stage actor]] during the 1980s, before being cast in supporting roles in film and television. He gained critical acclaim in the early 1990s, culminating in his first [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for 1995's ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'', followed by a [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor Oscar]] win for 1999's ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]''. Spacey has since spent time working on stage productions in [[London]], and has remained in the public eye, starring in several major [[Hollywood]] films, including ''[[Se7en]]'', ''[[Pay It Forward]]'', ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'', ''[[L.A. Confidential (film)|L.A. Confidential]]'', and his most recent role in ''[[Superman Returns]]''.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Spacey was born '''Kevin Spacey Fowler'''<ref name="name">{{cite web | title=FilmMonthly | work=The Alien World Of Kevin Spacey | url=http://www.filmmonthly.com/profiles/Articles/KSpacey/KSpacey.html | accessdate=July 2 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> in [[South Orange, New Jersey]] to Thomas Geoffrey Fowler, a [[technical writer]], and Kathleen (Spacey), a secretary; he has two older siblings: a sister and a brother, Randy. His father, who has been alleged by [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] to have been a member of the [[American Nazi Party]],<ref name="fox news">{{cite web | title=Fox News | work=Kevin Spacey's Family Secrets Are Out | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,118360,00.html | accessdate=June 26 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> was often unemployed, causing the family to move frequently, eventually settling in [[Southern California]] in 1963. Spacey attended [[Northridge]] [[Military Academy]] after he set his sister's [[treehouse]] on fire, but was asked to leave after throwing a tire at another student at the academy, and subsequently attended Chatsworth High School in [[Chatsworth, California]]. In the twelfth grade, he starred in the school's senior production of ''[[The Sound of Music]]'', playing the part of [[Captain]] [[Georg von Trapp]], opposite Maria (played by [[Mare Winningham]]). While in high school, he took his mother's maiden name, "Spacey" (originally a [[Wales|Welsh]] name, belonging to his great-great-grandfather, spelled "Spacy"), as his acting surname.<ref name="soroff">{{cite web | title=The Improper Bostonian| work=Soroff/On Kevin Spacey | url=http://www.drivingmrspacey.com/TheImproperBostonian.htm | accessdate=July 2 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Several reports have incorrectly suggested that he took the name in tribute to actor [[Spencer Tracy]], combining Tracy's first and last names.<ref name="soroff" />

Spacey had tried to succeed as a [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]] for several years,<ref name="abc">{{cite web | title=ABC TV | work=Kevin Spacey | url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/enoughrope/transcripts/s1679270.htm | accessdate=July 13 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> before attending the [[Juilliard School]] in [[New York City]], where he studied drama, between 1979 and 1981. During this time period, Spacey performed stand-up comedy in [[bowling]] alley talent contests.<ref name="abc" />

===Career===
Spacey's first professional stage appearance was as a messenger in a [[New York Shakespeare Festival]] performance of ''[[Henry VI, part 1]]'' in 1981. The following year he made his first [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] appearance in a production of [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]''. He made his first major television appearance in the second season premiere of ''[[Crime Story (TV series)|Crime Story]]'', playing a [[Kennedy family|Kennedy]]-esque American [[United States Senate|Senator]]. Although his interest soon turned to film, Spacey remained actively involved in the live theater community. In 1991, he won a [[Tony Award]] for his portrayal of "Uncle Louie" in [[Neil Simon]]'s [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] hit ''[[Lost in Yonkers]]''. Spacey's father was unconvinced that Spacey could make a career for himself as an actor, and did not change his mind until Spacey became a well known theatre actor.<ref name="abc" />

Some of Spacey's earlier roles include a widowed eccentric millionaire on ''[[L.A. Law]]'', the [[made-for-television]] film ''[[The Murder of Mary Phagan]]'' (1988) opposite [[Jack Lemmon]], and the [[Richard Pryor]]/[[Gene Wilder]]-starring comedy ''[[See No Evil, Hear No Evil]]'' (1989). Spacey earned an avid fan following after playing the criminally insane arms dealer Mel Profitt on the [[television]] series ''[[Wiseguy]]''. He quickly developed a reputation as a character actor, and was cast in bigger roles, including one-half of the bickering [[Connecticut]] couple in the [[dark comedy]] ''[[The Ref]]'' (1994), a malicious Hollywood studio boss in the [[satire]] ''[[Swimming with Sharks]]'', and the put-upon office manager in the all-star ensemble film ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross (film)|Glengarry Glen Ross]]'' (1992), gaining him positive notices by critics.

In 1995, Spacey played a [[John Doe (Se7en)|serial killer]] in ''[[Se7en (film)|Se7en]]'' who murders people he thinks guilty of the [[seven deadly sins]], and the enigmatic criminal [[Verbal Kint]] in ''[[The Usual Suspects]]''. His role in ''The Usual Suspects'' launched him to A-list status and won him an [[Academy Award]] for Best Supporting Actor. In 1996, he played an egomaniacal [[district attorney]] in ''[[A Time to Kill (film)|A Time to Kill]]'', and founded [[Trigger Street Productions]] in 1997 with the purpose of producing and developing [[entertainment]] across various [[Mass media|media]]. In 1996 he made his directorial debut with the film ''[[Albino Alligator]]''. The film was a failure at the box office but Spacey's direction was praised.

[[Image:Spacey beauty.jpg|thumb|Kevin Spacey in his Oscar winning role as Lester Burnham in ''American Beauty''.]]
Spacey won universal praise and a [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor Oscar]] for his role as a [[depression (mood)|depressed]] suburban father who re-evaluates his life in 1999's ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]''; the same year, he was honored with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. During the several years following ''American Beauty'''s release, Spacey appeared in films that he believes "hadn't done as well critically or in terms of box office".<ref name="sundaymail">{{cite web | title=The Sunday Mail | work=Kev's in full swing | url=http://www.thesundaymail.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5936,19638029%255E5001182,00.html | accessdate=July 1 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> He played a physically and emotionally scarred grade school teacher in ''[[Pay It Forward]]'', a patient in a mental institution who may or may not be an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] in ''[[K-PAX (film)|K-Pax]]'', and [[singer]] [[Bobby Darin]] in ''[[Beyond the Sea (film)|Beyond the Sea]]''. ''Beyond The Sea'' was a lifelong dream project for Spacey, who took on co-writing, directing, and starring duties in the [[biography]]/musical about Darin's life, career, and relationship with late actress [[Sandra Dee]]. Spacey provided his own vocals on the ''Beyond the Sea'' [[soundtrack]] and appeared in several tribute concerts around the time of the film's release. He received mostly positive reviews for his singing, as well as a [[Golden Globe]] nomination for his performance. However, reviewers criticized the age disparity between Spacey and Darin, noting that Spacey was too old to convincingly portray him.<ref name="sundaymail" /> Spacey has said that despite criticism, he is still proud of the film.<ref name="sundaymail" />

In 2001, Kevin co-hosted with [[Dame Judi Dench]] ''Unite for the Future Gala'', the [[UK]]'s fundraiser for the British Victims of [[9/11]] and [[Medecins Sans Frontieres]] at [[London]]'s [[Old Vic Theatre]], produced by [[Harvey Goldsmith]] and [[Dominic Madden]].

Spacey's next film role is as the [[MIT]] lecturer in the film "[[21 (2008 film)|21]]", where he stars alongside [[Kate Bosworth]], [[Laurence Fishburne]] and the relatively unknown actor, [[Jim Sturgess]]. The film is based on [[Ben Mezrich]]'s best seller, ''[[Bringing Down the House (book)|Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six MIT Students Who Took Vegas for Millions]]'', a story about student MIT card-counters who used [[mathematical probability]] to aid them in card games such as [[Black Jack]]. As of March, 2007, filming for "21" has taken place at The Castle on the [[Boston University]] campus, the MIT campus, and [[Boston]]'s [[Chinatown, Boston|Chinatown]].

===Old Vic===
In February 2003, Spacey announced that he was returning to [[London]] to become the artistic director of the [[Old Vic]], one of the city's oldest theatres. Spacey directed the new Old Vic Theatre Company, which stages shows eight months out of the year, starting in 2004. Spacey starred in two shows a season, in addition to directorial duties. During the 2004-05 season, Spacey directed a performance of the play ''[[Cloaca (film)|Cloaca]]'' by [[Maria Goos]], and performed in productions of ''National Anthems'' by Dennis McIntyre, as well in ''[[The Philadelphia Story]]'' by [[Philip Barry]]. During the 2005-06 season, Spacey performed in the title role of ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'' (directed by [[Trevor Nunn]]). He was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by [[London South Bank University]] in November 2005. Spacey has noted that he is "having the time of [his] life" working at the Old Vic, and explained that at this point in his career, he feels that he is "trying to do things now that are much bigger than myself and outside of myself". In 2006, he starred in [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s ''[[A Moon for the Misbegotten]]'' along with [[Colm Meaney]]; the play received great reviews ("If you only see one play this year, see this one").<ref name="abc" />

Spacey hosted the long-running NBC sketch show [[Saturday Night Live]] twice: once in 1997 with musical guest [[Beck]] and special guests [[Michael Palin]] and [[John Cleese]] from [[Monty Python's Flying Circus]] (where Spacey impersonated [[Christopher Walken]], [[Walter Matthau]], and [[Jack Lemmon]] in a three-part pre-taped sketch about actors who auditioned for the original [[Star Wars]] movie) and again in the last episode of the 31st season with musical guest [[Nelly Furtado]] (where Spacey played a detective in the sketch "Two A-Holes At A Crime Scene," one of the Falconer's past selves in Will Forte's "The Falconer" sketch, [[Neil Young]] in a fake commercial for a new album with songs by musicians who are against George W. Bush and his administration, and as himself in a "The Usual Suspects" parody where Andy Samberg lies to Spacey as to why he's late to the show).

Spacey's most recent film role is as the villainous [[Lex Luthor]] in the [[Bryan Singer]]-directed [[superhero]] film, ''[[Superman Returns]]''. It has recently been confirmed that he will reprise the role in the upcoming sequel, scheduled for 2009. The film opened on [[June 28]], [[2006]]. Spacey also appears in ''[[Edison Force]]'' (originally titled ''Edison''), co-starring [[Morgan Freeman]] and [[Justin Timberlake]]; ''Edison Force'' received a direct-to-video release on [[July 18]], [[2006]].

Spacey is well-known in Hollywood for his skillful [[impersonator|impersonations]] - when he appeared on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'' he imitated, at the request of host [[James Lipton]]: [[Jimmy Stewart]], [[Johnny Carson]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Clint Eastwood]], [[John Gielgud]], [[Marlon Brando]], [[Christopher Walken]], [[Al Pacino]] and [[Jack Lemmon]].

===Personal life===

Spacey is a personal friend of former President [[Bill Clinton]], having met Clinton before his presidency began.<ref name="abc" /> Spacey has described Clinton as "one of the shining lights" of the political process.<ref name="abc" /> According to [[Federal Election Commission]] data, Spacey has contributed $42,000 to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidates and committees.<ref name="politics">{{cite web | title=NewsMeat.com | work=Kevin Spacey's campaign contribution report | url=http://www.newsmeat.com/celebrity_political_donations/Kevin_Spacey.php | accessdate=July 17 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>  He additionally had a [[cameo appearance]] in [[President Clinton: Final Days]], a light-hearted [[political satire]] produced by the [[Clinton administration]] for the [[White House Correspondents Dinner]].<ref name="newyorktimes">{{cite web | title=The New York Times | work=President Clinton: Final Days | url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=241447 | accessdate=January 28 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

In September 2006, Spacey announced that he intends to stay on at the Old Vic, for at least another nine years, and that due to his continuing UK residency he intends to take-up British citizenship when it becomes available to him.<ref name="telegraph">{{cite web | title=The Daily Telegraph | work=Spacey sets the stage for nine years at the Old Vic | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/09/10/nspacey10.xml | accessdate=September 12 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>
