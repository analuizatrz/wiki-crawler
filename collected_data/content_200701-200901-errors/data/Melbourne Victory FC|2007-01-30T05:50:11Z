'''Melbourne Victory FC''' is a [[football (soccer)]] club based in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. It is Melbourne's entry in the re-vamped national league, the [[A-League]]. The club guaranteed the [[A-League 2006-07|2006/2007 A-League Premiership]] with a win against the [[New Zealand Knights]] on [[December 17]], [[2006]] thus qualifying for the [[AFC Champions League 2008|2008]] [[AFC Champions League]].

==History==
Melbourne Victory was founded in [[2004]] after the announcement of a revamped domestic league in Australia. The new A-League replaced the [[National Soccer League]] (NSL), which collapsed in 2004. Eight licenses were handed out by [[Football Federation Australia]]. The FFA enforced a 'one city one team' policy to avoid ethnic rivalries that plagued the old NSL.

FFA approved a Melbourne Victory consortium to be Melbourne's team, asking Belgravia Leisure Pty Ltd to back the club. Thus the Chairman and CEO of Belgravia Leisure, Geoff Lord, was installed as the inaugural Chairman of Melbourne Victory F.C. After this FFA confirmed that Melbourne Victory would represent Melbourne in the A-League.

Staff members were then signed. Gary Cole (an ex-Socceroo) was hired to become Football Operations manager and [[Ernie Merrick]] was hired as head coach from the [[Victorian Institute of Sport]] (VIS). [[Archie Thompson]], a [[Socceroo]] who had been playing in Europe with [[Lierse]], was Melbourne Victory's first squad player signing. The club signed three more prominent internationals for their squad - [[Kevin Muscat]], [[Richard Kitzbichler]] and [[Geoffrey Claeys]].

The squad was quickly assembled, although still a fair amount of room was left for signings before Melbourne played its first competitive match against [[Adelaide United]] in a [[World Club Championship]] qualifier.

On [[27 October]] 2005 [[South Korea|South Korean]] electronics giant [[Samsung]] became the club's major sponsor in a two year deal, believed to be the largest in Australian domestic football history.

==Stadium==
On the back of a then home-and-away season record attendance of 39,730 at the [[Telstra Dome]] (the new record of 50,333 was set on [[December 8]], [[2006]] - see below) for the 3-2 win over [[Sydney FC]] on [[September 2]] [[2006]], it was announced that seven home matches would be moved to the Dome. Only one match - against the struggling [[New Zealand Knights]] - would remain at the club's original home [[Olympic Park, Melbourne|Olympic Park]], due to a music concert the night of and after the game by [[Robbie Williams]]. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/Sport/Victory-makes-leap-from-park-to-stadium/2006/09/21/1158431836539.html|title=Victory makes leap from park to stadium|date=[[2006-09-21]]|publisher=[[The Age]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.melbournevictory.com.au/default.aspx?s=newsdisplay&id=5577&pageid=71|title=Victory Jets to Dome again|date=[[2006-10-20]]}}</ref>

The new record attendance of 50,333 was achieved on [[December 8]], [[2006]] for the return match against Sydney FC. It was an anticlimatic game with the result being 0-0 with [[Archie Thompson]] and [[Daniel Allsopp]] missing crucial chances.

The club is planning to move to a new stadium to the east of the current Olympic Park complex. The new [[Melbourne Rectangular Stadium]] is currently planned to seat approximately 20,000 spectators (expandable to 25,000) and is expected to be completed in time for the start of the 2008/09 campaign. The new stadium is scheduled to be finished in time for to the 2008-09 A-League season, but Victory's 2006-07 [[A-League]] season home attendance average was above 30,000, and if these attendence figures are sustained over the coming seasons, the new stadium would be obsolete for the club before a ball is kicked at the ground. On [[December 5]], [[2006]], the news surfaced that the club would fight the size of the stadium to at least 35,000 seats with the Government's minister of sport.{{Fact|date=January 2007}} 

If the new stadium's capacity is not to the club's liking, Melbourne Victory FC have promised their fans that games will remain at Telstra Dome until a large enough stadium is built. However, recently the Victorian Government have become increasingly worried that without the Victory's support, the plan will turnout a complete disaster.{{Fact|date=January 2007}} If Victory do not play out of the new stadium, only one tenant, [[Melbourne Storm]], will play out of the stadium, and given that the Storms attendances only average around the 11,000 mark, the Government would stand to lose lots of money. Therefore, the Government are completely rethinking the stadium, and its tenants.{{Fact|date=January 2007}} A new plan has been put on the table recently for Victory: the Government may decide to just refurbish [[Olympic Park Stadium]] for the Storm to around 22,000, which would be sufficient for their current fan-base, and build a 40,000+ stadium for the Victory and other important football matches.{{Fact|date=January 2007}}

==Kit==
Melbourne Victory have one home and one away kit for the 2006/07 A-League season. The kit colours are navy blue, silver and white, which encompass the navy blue and white traditional state sporting colours of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. The club badge and away kit display the "V", a symbol that has long been an identifier of Victorian sporting teams.

==Supporters==
Melbourne Victory is the only A-League team based in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and have a dedicated fan base - the club have consistently set records for A-League attendances. With the move to Telstra Dome during the 2006/07 season, and as the team have been top of the league throughout the season, large crowds have been a constant feature of Victory home games.  On [[December 8]], [[2006]], a crowd of 50,333 attended the match against [[Sydney FC]] at the Telstra Dome.  This is the largest attendance on record for a domestic football match in Australia and it was the second highest attendance world-wide for that weekend in football (Manchester United were the only club to record a higher attendance).

Melbourne Victory has a number of supporter groups, each group with its own style of support.   These groups include ''BWB'' (Blue and White Brigade), ''M7C'' (May 7 Crew), ''SDC'' (Southern Death Crew), ''Flat Cap Crew'' (Ozspurs), ''BWB Youth'', ''Frontline'', ''OSS'' (Offside Set), ''T-27'' (Terrace 27), ''VRF'' (victory rage firm) and a small number of members associated with Melbourne Victory's original supporters group, ''UNION''. The British style support are generally seated at the Southern End of the Olympic Park stadium; the North-East Terrace hosts the European style support led by the ''BWB''.

==Rivalries==

Sydney FC are developing into Melbourne Victory's main rivals, which Melbourne fans consider the most heated rivalry in the A-League.  Given the short history of the league, this is primarily due to other historical competitions and rivalries between the cities of [[Melbourne]] and [[Sydney]]. 

Melbourne and [[Adelaide United]] are also developing a rivalry.  Both sides' traveling fans turn out in good numbers when the two teams clash, and often have heated exchanges. An incident during the Round 8 clash of the 2006/07 season saw Melbourne captain [[Kevin Muscat]] knock Adelaide United coach [[John Kosmina]] from his chair in the technical area, as he was retrieving the play ball that had rolled under Kosmina's chair.  The Adelaide coach jumped to his feet and grabbed Muscat by the throat as the two exchanged words on the sideline. Muscat was given a yellow card, while Kosmina was sent to the stand and later received a four-match ban from the technical area for his part in the altercation.
