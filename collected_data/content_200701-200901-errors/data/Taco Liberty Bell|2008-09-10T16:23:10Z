On [[April 1]], [[1996]], Taco Bell took out a full-page advertisement in seven leading U.S. newspapers<ref name="Leroux"/> including ''[[The New York Times]]'' announcing that they had purchased the [[Liberty Bell]] to "reduce the country's debt" and renamed it the "Taco Liberty Bell". Thousands of people protested before it was revealed at noon April 1 that the sale was a [[hoax]].<ref>{{cite news

The prank was considered a successful advertising gambit by those involved. David Paine, a public relations consultant, called it "the most successful project I've been involved with". The campaign cost was just $300,000, but it generated an estimated $25 million equivalent in free publicity, with a sales increase exceeding $1 million for the first two days in April. Paine, however, feels that the climate today is much more cautious and a comparable prank is not possible.<ref name="Leroux">{{cite news

According to marketing author Thomas L. Harris, the stunt worked because "in today's world ... almost everything is corporate-sponsored", making the announcement believable even for "a national historic monument." The company coined the term "publitisement" to describe its stunt, "breaking through advertising clutter to achieve massive awareness" for its then-new "Nothing Ordinary About It" ad campaign.<ref>{{cite book
