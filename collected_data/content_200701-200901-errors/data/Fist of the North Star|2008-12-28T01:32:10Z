==Publication history==
===Pilot version===
The original [[One-shot (comics)|one shot]] prototype of ''Hokuto no Ken'', published in the April 1983 edition of ''Fresh Jump'', was set in present-day Japan and told the story of a teenager by the name of {{nihongo|Kenshiro Kasumi|霞 拳四郎|Kasumi Kenshirō}}, the successor of the "''[[Hokuto Shinken]]''" [[martial arts]] style, a deadly style which kills or cripples opponents internally by striking [[pressure point]]s. Kenshiro's main adversaries in this incarnation of the story were a rival martial arts school known as the {{nihongo|''Taizanji Kenpo''|泰山寺拳法||"[[Mount Tai|Taishan]] Temple Martial Arts"}}, a secret organization of assassins with influence over the [[Japanese government]]. Kenshiro's girlfriend, Yuki, becomes a witness in one of the organization's [[assassination|hits]] and is subsequently killed by the culprit, with Kenshiro being framed for the crime. This event serves as a catalyst for Kenshiro's war against the Taizanji organization.
A second one-shot, titled ''Hokuto no Ken II'', was published in the June 1983 issue of ''Fresh Jump''. Both pilots were collected in the second collected volume of ''Tetsu no Don Quixote'' (Tetsuo Hara's prior manga series before ''Hokuto no Ken'').

Tetsuo Hara has stated that he came up with the idea of ''Hokuto no Ken'' from his editor [[Nobuhiko Horie]]. According to Hara, Horie suggested to him that he should draw a manga about "a [[martial artist]] who destroys his opponents by striking their acupressure points" based on Hara's wishes to draw a martial arts manga and his knowledge of pressure points. [At an [[Anime Expo]] 2004 panel, Buronson stated that the tone of the series was inspired by [[Bruce Lee]]'s films.] At the time, Hara was having trouble breaking into the market, and Fist ended up being his first hit. <ref name=raijinhara>{{cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20040629155120/www.raijincomics.com/extra/articles/article.aspx?_cid=77 |title=Interview with Hara Tetsuo|accessdate=2007-07-21 |format=html |work=Raijin Comics (waybacked) }}</ref>

===Serialization===
[[Image:Shonen Jump 092683.jpg|thumb|left|''Weekly Shonen Jump'', Issue #41 from 1983, featuring the debut of the ''Hokuto no Ken'' series.]]
The two ''Hokuto no Ken'' one-shots were well-received in ''Fresh Jump'''s reader's survey and when Tetsuo Hara was commissioned to turn ''Hokuto no Ken'' into a weekly series, the task was reportedly too much for Hara to handle alone and manga writer [[Yoshiyuki Okamura]] (who worked on the series under the pen name of [[Buronson]]) was assigned to work with him. The storyline was completely revamped, with the present-day setting being discarded in favor of a ''[[Mad Max]]''-inspired post apocalyptic future. The Taizanji Kenpo school were no longer the main antagonists and Kenshiro, originally a teenager, was now an adult with seven scars on his chest whose design was partly inspired by [[Bruce Lee]].<ref name=ADVBuronson>{{cite web |url=http://www.advfilms.com/titles/fistofthenorthstar/interview.html|title=Interview with Buronson|accessdate=2007-07-21 |format=html |work=ADV Films Presents: New Fist of the North Star }}</ref>

Originally, Tetsuo Hara was contracted to do ''Fist of the North Star'' for a three-year run, but due to its popularity and the publisher's demand, it was extended to a five-year run.<ref name="raijinhara" />

===Sequels and spinoffs===
After the manga ended its run, Tetsuo Hara and Buronson wrote a novel based on the manga titled {{nihongo|''Cursed City''|呪縛の街|Jubaku no Machi}}, published by Jump Books in Japan in 1996. It was adapted into a three-part [[OVA]] series titled {{nihongo|''New Fist of the North Star''|新・北斗の拳|Shin Hokuto no Ken}} in 2003. The story is set sometime after the conclusion of the manga.

In 2001, Tetsuo Hara began working on a ''Fist of the North Star'' prequel titled {{nihongo|''[[Fist of the Blue Sky]]''|蒼天の拳|Sōten no Ken}}, which is currently serialized in  ''[[Weekly Comic Bunch]]''. Set during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1935, the story stars [[Hokuto Shinken]] predecessor and Kenshiro's namesake, Kenshiro Kasumi.

Following the theatrical release of the movie ''Raō Den Jun'ai no Sho'' in 2006, numerous ''Fist of the North Star'' spinoffs began to be published in the ''Weekly Comic Bunch'' and ''Big Comics Superior''. This lineup of titles has been dubbed the {{nihongo|''Hokuto Gaiden''|北斗外伝}} series, as each title focuses on a major character from the franchise. The following titles had been published so far:

* {{nihongo|''The Conquering King of the Heavens: Fist of the North Star Raoh's Story''|[[w:ja:天の覇王 北斗の拳ラオウ外伝|天の覇王 北斗の拳 ラオウ外伝]]|Ten no Haō - Hokuto no Ken Raō Gaiden}} by [[Youkow Osada]]. - A series that was serialized in ''Weekly Comics Bunch'' featuring Reina and Souga from the ''Raoh Den'' movie.

==Plot overview==
The prologue of ''Fist of the North Star'' informs us that the world was engaged in a global [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] in the year [[19XX|199X]]. After the war, the earth's surface became devoid of vegetation, the seas evaporated and civilization was thrown into chaos, turning everyday life into a battle for supplies of uncontaminated food and water, where the strong survive by preying on the weak. However, one man vows to make a difference. [[Kenshiro]] is the successor of the art of [[Hokuto Shinken]], a deadly 1,800 year-old [[ansatsuken|assassination style]] that is only passed down from one master to a chosen son. Kenshiro uses his skills and knowledge to protect the innocent from the bloodthirsty gangs that threaten their survival. Throughout the course of the series, Kenshiro meets several allies and rivals, most of whom are also trained in various martial arts styles.

The first chapter serves to introduce Kenshiro and depicts his initial meeting with his two sidekicks, [[Bart (Fist of the North Star)|Bart]] and [[Lin (Fist of the North Star)|Lin]]. The initial story arc then centers Kenshiro's quest to reclaim his [[fiancee]] Yuria, who was taken from him by his former friend Shin, a master of the rival {{nihongo|''Nanto Seiken''|南斗聖拳||"Sacred Fist of the South Star"}} style.<ref name=Nanto>Like Hokuto, the term Nanto is usually localized in English translations as "South Star" (or "Southern Cross" in the Viz edition, the name of Shin's city). Nanto actually refers to the [[Dipper (Chinese constellation)|South Dipper]], a Chinese asterism that forms part of [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]]. The ''Fighting Mania'' arcade game actually alternates between "South Star" and the literal "South Dipper" in translations. The asterism has no relation to the [[Southern Cross]].</ref>  After the Shin arc, the manga began focusing around one-off arc-based villains such as the Golan, Jackal and the Fang Clan, although the story gradually shifts to Ken's search for his three adopted brothers, who were trained in the Hokuto Shinken style under the same master but were not chosen to be successors. The eldest of the brothers, [[Raoh]], becomes the primary [[antagonist]] and Ken's primary nemesis at this point, a conqueror who uses Hokuto Shinken to rule with tyranny. A major [[sub-plot]] is also introduced in the form of an internal conflict within the Nanto school between its six grand masters, the {{nihongo|''Nanto Roku Seiken''|南斗六聖拳||"Six Sacred Fists of the South Star"}}, and the Hokuto brothers' involvement in it.

In issue 136, the death of Raoh marks the end of the first era of the series and the setting jumps several years, with Ken's sidekicks Bart and Lin having reached adulthood. Kenshiro returns to help Bart and Lin overthrow the evil Jakoh, a corrupt Governor General that has usurped the throne of the Heavenly Empress and is coercing the {{nihongo|Gento Kōken|元斗皇拳||"Original Dipper Imperial Fist"}} masters to do his evil bidding. After Jakoh's defeat, Lin is kidnapped and taken overseas to the {{nihongo|Land of [[Asura]]|修羅の国|Shura no Kuni}}, a war-torn nation now ruled by the three {{nihongo|''Rashō''|羅将||General of Asura}}. The origins of the Hokuto brothers and the Hokuto Shinken style are revealed, as well as the existence of the forbidden {{nihongo|''Hokuto Ryūken''|北斗琉拳||"North Star [[Gemstone|Gem]] Fist"}} style, a branch of the original {{nihongo|Hokuto Family|北斗宗家|Hokuto Sōke}} formed alongside with Hokuto Shinken.

After Kaioh's defeat, Raoh's son Ryu is introduced as Kenshiro's apprentice and possible successor to the Hokuto Shinken style. After Kenshiro restores order to the two neighbouring kingdoms of Sava and Blanca, the final chapter centers around the love triangle between Ken, Lin and Bart.

===Characters===
{{see|List of characters in Fist of the North Star}}
''Fist of the North Star'' has a large ensemble of characters that has changed constantly during the series' original five-year run. Among the inhabitants of the post-apocalyptic world of ''Fist of the North Star'' includes martial artists, royal families, rebels, bandits and villagers that are merely attempting to survive a cruel, harsh world.

Although protagonist [[Kenshiro]] is the only truly permanent character from the series' inception up until the final chapter, his two [[sidekick]]s, Bart and Lin have served as series' mainstays as well, introduced as a pair of orphaned children whom Kenshiro meets during the first chapter of the series and then growing up into rebel leaders and heroes in their own right.

Kenshiro encounters several rivals and allies throughout the course of the series, many of whom are affiliated with the martial arts schools featured in the series (see fighting styles section). The series initially focuses on two rival factions, the [[Hokuto Shinken]] school and the [[Nanto Seiken]] school. [[Characters in Fist of the North Star#Shin|Shin]], a representative of Nanto Seiken, serves as Kenshiro's first major nemesis, being the man responsible for engraving the seven stab wounds on Kenshiro's chest and kidnapping his fiancee [[Characters in Fist of the North Star#Yuria|Yuria]]. After Shin's death, the authors would expand the storyline by introducing other Hokuto and Nanto disciples, namely the Nanto Roku Seiken and the four Hokuto brothers. A major recurring antagonist is introduced in the form of [[Raoh]], the eldest of the four Hokuto brothers, who would become the series' most prominent villain.

After Raoh's death, the [[Characters in Fist of the North Star#Gento Koken|Gento Kōken]] fighters and their leader Falco would serve as reluctant adversaries of Kenshiro. Another group of antagonists are introduced with the fighters from the Land of Asura. Their ruler of Asura, [[Characters in Fist of the North Star#Hokuto Ryuken|Kaioh]] of the Hokuto Ryuken school, is the last major nemesis Kenshiro confronts in the series, although other villains appear after him in the manga.

Many of the characters in the series have since become stars of their own spinoff manga (see later works section).

===Fighting styles===
{{see|List of fighting styles in Fist of the North Star}}
The primary [[fighting style]] depicted in ''Fist of the North Star'' is ''[[Hokuto Shinken]]'', the style used by Kenshiro and his three adopted brothers. ''Hokuto Shinken'' relies primarily on 708 secret [[accupressure]] points on the human's body that forms part of a fictional system known as the {{nihongo|''keiraku hikō''|経絡秘孔||"secret [[Meridian (Chinese medicine)|channeling]] points"}}. By pushing into one of the ''hikō'' points, one can cause destruction into the enemy's body from within or even control their body against their own will. There are also beneficial ''hikō'' points that can be used to cure sickness or heal wounds, including restore a mute person's voice or a blind person's sight. In addition, the masters of ''Hokuto Shinken'' can tap into their body's full potential strength, whereas an average person only uses 30% of their strength.

The main rival style of ''Hokuto Shinken'' in the beginning of the series is ''[[Nanto Seiken]]'', a style which is described as the [[yin and yang|polar opposite]] of ''Hokuto Shinken''. In contrast to the ''Hokuto'' style, which uses the ''hikō'' points to cause destruction from within, the ''Nanto'' style specializes in stabbing and slicing techniques that penetrate the body from the outside and destroy everything in its path. Originally the style is used by Shin, the first major antagonist, but throughout the course of the series the existence of other branches of the ''Nanto Seiken'' are revealed, the six top branches being the ''Nanto Roku Seiken''.

Two other major styles are introduced during the latter half of the series; ''Gento Kōken'', a style which specializes in  [[qi|ki]]-based projectile attacks that destroy the enemy on a cellular level; and ''Hokuto Ryūken'', a brother style of ''Hokuto Shinken'' which causes destruction through an opponent's {{nihongo|''keiraku hakō''|経絡破孔||"destructive [[Meridian (Chinese medicine)|channeling]] points"}} and teaches its users to summon their {{nihongo|"demonic aura"|魔闘気|matōki}}.

===English editions===
[[Image:FotNS Master Ed 1.jpg|thumb|right|''Fist of the North Star: Master Edition Vol. 9'', published by Gutsoon.]]
Two different companies attempted to translate the original ''Fist of the North Star'' manga for the English market, although both attempts failed to finish their run. [[VIZ Media|VIZ Communications]] originally published the first sixteen chapters in eight monthly squarebound comic book issues (two/three chapters per issue) in 1989. Viz resumed publication of the series from 1995 to 1997, publishing the subsequent 28 chapters of the series in 18 monthly pamphlet-sized issues (each issue containing roughly one chapter and a half) divided into three "parts". Four graphic novel collections were published by Viz: ''Fist of the North Star'', ''Night of the Jackal'', ''Southern Cross'' and ''Blood Brothers''. The Viz edition featured mirrored artwork, as was the standard with English translated manga at the time. Unfortunately, due to its age and a changing comic market more oriented towards [[T&A]] than mature violence[I.E. [[Gen 13]]], Fist was never really a hit with the company.

In 2003, [[Raijin Comics|Gutsoon! Entertainment]] began publishing a ''Master Edition'' of the series, large squarebound graphic novel installments (eight/nine chapters per volume) that were printed in high quality paper. In addition to sporting a revised translation and retaining the original right-to-left orientation, the ''Master Edition'' of the series also featured new [[Computer-generated imagery|CG]] coloring added to the original artwork. Gutsoon ceased publication of the series with Vol. 9 due to the company folding. While a significant accomplishment for an older title, the higher prices of the Master Editions-compared to other manga released around the same time-and the alleged non-female appeal of the series are believed to have made it a hard sell in the U.S. Ironically, however, more volumes of it were published domestically than its flashier and more female-oriented prequel. The license has yet to be picked up by another company.

[[Image:Hokuto anime.jpg|thumb|right|TV's ''Hokuto no Ken'' title card.]]
[[Image:Hokuto2 anime.jpg|thumb|right|''Hokuto no Ken 2'' title card.]]
''Hokuto no Ken'' was first adaptated into a weekly anime series by [[Toei Animation]]. The series aired on [[Fuji Television]] from October 4, 1984 to March 5, 1987 and was given the subtitle of {{nihongo|''Seikimatsu Kyūseishu Densetsu''|世紀末救世主伝説||"Legend of the Century's End Savior"}} following episode 22.<ref name=airdate>{{cite web|url=http://www.toei-anim.co.jp/lineup/tv/hokuto/|title=北斗の拳 (official Toei site)|language=Japanese|accessdate=2007-09-01}}</ref> It was immediately followed by a sequel series, titled ''Hokuto no Ken 2'', which aired from March 13, 1987 to February 18, 1988. A combined total of 152 episodes were produced for the two series. Reruns are aired in Japan on the [[satellite television]] network [[Animax]].

The violent content of the TV series is toned down considerably compared to the original manga, with much of the gore being discolored via desaturation. Like many manga-based anime series, [[Filler (media)|filler]] material was added to prevent the series from getting ahead of its source material.

The ''Hokuto no Ken'' portion of the series spans four major story arcs that follows the manga's plotline from the beginning and up until chapter 136 (prior to the timeskip). Each story arc (or chapters, as they referred within the show) spans a certain number of episodes each adapting a portion of the original manga. The first chapter is based on chapters 1-25 of the original manga, but changes the order of events so that Ken's battle with Shin is left for last, turning all the other villains into his subordinates. The rest of the series follows the manga's plotline more closely. The ''Hokuto no Ken 2'' portion takes place after the timeskip and adapts the storyline of the Celestial Emperor and Asura arcs of the manga. The post-Asura chapters were not adapted for the series.

The entire series has been collected on DVD in Japan, in a boxed collection known as the ''Super Premium Box''<ref name=premiumbox>{{cite web|url=http://polydor.jp/anime/hokuto/premierbox.html|title=北斗の拳 DVD BOX|language=Japanese|accessdate=2007-08-04}}</ref> and in 26 individually released discs containing 5-6 episodes per volume.<ref name=hokutodvd>{{cite web|url=http://polydor.jp/anime/hokuto/index.html|title=北斗の拳|language=Japanese|accessdate=2007-08-04}}</ref> A three volume DVD series, the ''Kyūkyoku Retsuden'' series, contains highlight episodes of the show.<ref name=kyukyokuretsuden>{{cite web|url=http://polydor.jp/anime/hokuto/kyukyoku_1.html|title=北斗の拳 究極列伝|language=Japanese|accessdate=2007-08-04}}</ref> Prior to the DVD release of the series, Toei released three hour-long compilation episodes on [[VHS]] composed of re-edited footage from the series. Toei is currently planning an [[High-definition video|HD]] [[Remaster]] Edition of the ''Hokuto no Ken'' DVD Box Set in commemoration of the franchise's 25th anniversary. In addition to containing all 152 episodes on 26 discs, the set will also contain two additional discs of bonus content: the first bonus disc will contain all three episodes of the ''Hokuto no Ken'' Digest Edition previously released only on VHS. The second bonus disc will contain credit-less opening and closing animation, the original preview ad for the series, the first episode of ''Hokuto no Ken'' dubbed in [[Beijing dialect]] and interviews with the staff and cast of the show. The set will also come packaged with a deluxe [[booklet]] and a reproduction of a promotional ''Hokuto no Ken'' poster issued prior to the show's first airing. A Limited Edition version of the box set will also come packaged with a Kenshiro and Kokuoh figure by [[Kaiyodo]]. The box set was released on March 28, 2008.<ref name=hdremaster>{{cite web|url=http://www.toei-anim.co.jp/dvd/hokutonoken/|title=「北斗の拳」DVD-BOX発売|language=Japanese|accessdate=2007-10-19}}</ref>

The first 36 episodes were licensed to [[Manga Entertainment]] and released in English dubbed and subtitled formats on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]]. Manga Entertainment initially released the series in eight VHS volumes spanning only 24 episodes in 1999 and later released all 36 episodes in five DVD volumes in 2003.<ref name=mangavideo>{{cite web|url=http://www.manga.com/history2.html|title=MANGA ENTERTAINMENT HISTORY|work=html|accessdate = 2007-09-02}}</ref> The English dub of the show features a new soundtrack provided by [[Reinforced Records]] and voice acting by [[Animaze]]. The original opening and ending sequences were replaced by in-house versions produced by Manga Entertainment with music by Mike Egan. The dubbed version aired on [[Showtime Beyond]] in the US and on the [[Sci Fi Channel (United Kingdom)|Sci-Fi Channel]] in the UK. Manga Entertainment Australia never secured the rights to release the TV Series in Australia for unknown reasons. On May 2008, Toei began releasing English-subtitled episodes of the TV series on the internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toei-anim.com/ondemand/fistofnorthstar.html|title=Toei OnDemand - Fist of the North Star}}</ref> All 109 episodes of the first series are available on [[IGN]]{{'}}s pay-to-download website Direct2Drive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.direct2drive.com/Search.aspx?SearchTerm=fist%20of%20the%20north%20star|title=Direct2Drive: Fist of the North Star}}</ref>

A reviewer of DVD Vision Japan stated that the English voice acting was "terrible, even for an early dub" and compared [[David Lucas]]' performance as Shin unfavorably to his role as [[Spike Spiegel]] in ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]''. The same reviewer also states that the music by Mike Egan is mediocre.<ref name=DVDvision>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdvisionjapan.com/fist1.html|title=Fist of The North Star Vol 1 DVD Review.

===1986 animated movie===
{{main|Fist of the North Star (1986 film)}}
[[Image:FotNS02.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A promotional illustration of the ''Fist of the North Star'' animated movie.]]
An animated [[feature film]] version of ''Fist of the North Star'' was produced by [[Toei Animation]], which premiered in Japan on March 8, 1986.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0142371 |title=Hokuto no ken (1986) |publisher=Imdb.com |date= |accessdate=2008-09-14}}</ref> The movie was intended to be a big-screen treatment of the manga, and avoid the watering-down of violence that came with the TV series. An English-dubbed version produced by [[Streamline Pictures]] was first released in 1991 in the USA and 1994 in the UK and Australia by [[Manga Entertainment]]. A New Zealand release was never scheduled by Manga Entertainment so it never had an official release there.

===1995 live-action movie===
An American-produced live-action movie version of ''Fist of the North Star'' was released in 1995, directed by [[Tony Randel]] based on a script by Peter Atkins and Wynne McLaughlin. The movie, loosely based on the Shin storyline of the manga, stars [[Gary Daniels]] as Kenshiro, [[Costas Mandylor]] as Shin and Japanese actress Isako Washio as Yuria, with [[Malcolm McDowell]] as Ryuken and [[Chris Penn]] as "Jackal" (actually a renamed Jagi). It also featured a cameo by professional wrestler [[Big Van Vader|Leon White]] (then known as Big Van Vader) as Goliath. The movie saw a theatrical release in Japan, but went [[direct-to-video|straight-to-video]] in the US (though it did receive a premiere on HBO.) The Japanese dubbed version used the original voice actors from the 1980s anime series.

The movie had mixed reviews from fans and critics. [[Dave Foster]] of ''DVD Times'' panned the movie as a poor adaptation and commented that Kenshiro's pressure point techniques "''look rather tame''" in comparison to the way depicted in the manga and anime series.<ref name=DVDTimes>{{cite web|url=http://dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=12395|title=DVD Times - Fist of the North Star|accessdate=2007-07-30| author = Dave Foster}}
</ref> A reviewer from eFilmCritic remarked that Kenshiro's defeat at the hands of Shin "''comes off as standard''" and "''unbelievably goofy''" compared to the 1986 animated movie version. However, Video World gave a much more positive review, calling it "First rate." It has since been firmly established as a cult film in the west, and remains the film for which Gary Daniels is best known.

===''New Fist of the North Star''===
{{nihongo|''New Fist of the North Star''|新・北斗の拳|Shin Hokuto no Ken}} is a three-part [[OVA]] series produced by [[Toei Animation]] that was originally released in 2003 and 2004 in Japan. It is based on an original ''Hokuto no Ken'' novel by Buronson and Hara {{nihongo|''Jubaku no Machi''|呪縛の街||"The Cursed City"}}, whom the first episode of the trilogy draws its title from. It was fully licensed and released in English by [[ADV Films]]. [[Akira Kamiya]], who had voiced Kenshiro in all previous animated incarnations, was replaced by [[Takehito Koyasu]] for this new OVA series. Celebrity voices were also employed, with musician [[Gackt]] (who also performs the opening and ending themes of the OVA) as the antagonist Seiji. It was the last animated incarnation of ''Hokuto no Ken'' produced by Toei.

Set sometime after the conclusion of ''Hokuto no Ken 2'' and the original manga, a man named Sanga has constructed a fortified zone called The Last Land. While Sanga's men go out and seek water through violent means, they encounter Kenshiro who desires to end their reign of terror.

The ADV Films' dub of the trilogy has garnered positive reviews from critics. Chris Wood of Toon Zone praised "Kenshiro is in fine form, and though the story may not blow you away, it’s plenty adequate to support the action"<ref name=toonzone>{{cite web|url=http://news.toonzone.net/article.php?ID=345|title="New Fist of the North Star": My Mind Is Already Blown (Review from Toon Zone)|accessdate=2007-09-03}}</ref> Mike Toole of Anime Jump says that ''New Fist'' is "flashy and a little cheap, but ultimately rewarding."<ref name=newanimejump>{{cite web|url=http://www.animejump.com/index.php?module=prodreviews&func=showcontent&id=573|title=Anime Jump review of New Fist of the North Star|accessdate=2007-09-03}}</ref> Chris Beveridge of AnimeOnDVD.com was "very pleased with" the first episode,<ref name=animeondvdep1>{{cite web|url=http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/disc_reviews/3249.php|title=AnimeOnDVD.com >> Disc Reviews >> New Fist of the North Star Vol. #1 (also w/box)|accessdate=2007-09-03}}</ref> but felt that the second episode could've been "much better written"<ref name=animeondvdep2>{{cite web|url=http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/disc_reviews/3514.php|title=AnimeOnDVD.com >> Disc Reviews >> New Fist of the North Star Vol. #2|accessdate=2007-09-03}}</ref> and that the third episode was unnecessary and that the trilogy "could have been a lot tighter with a bit more streamlining of the script".<ref name=animeondvdep3>{{cite web|url=http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/disc_reviews/3559.php|title=AnimeOnDVD.com >> Disc Reviews >> New Fist of the North Star Vol. #3|accessdate=2007-09-03}}</ref>

===''Shin Kyūseishu Densetsu'' movie series===
[[Image:Hokuto no ken junnainosyou.jpg|thumb|right|Theatrical poster for ''Raoh Den - Jun'ai no Shō''.]]
In 2005, North Stars Pictures and [[Tokyo Movie Shinsha|TMS Entertainment]] announced the production of a planned five part ''Hokuto no Ken'' [[film series]] titled {{nihongo|''Shin Kyūseishu Densetsu''|真救世主伝説||"True Saviour Legend"}}.<ref name=2006movies>{{cite web|url=http://www.nsp.tv/whatnew.cgi?mode=detail&number=4|title=劇場版映画“北斗の拳「ラオウ外伝」純愛編”を2006年春全国東宝系公開|language=Japanese|accessdate=2007-08-30}}</ref> The films are both, remakes of and supplemental stories to the original manga series, and introduces a new supporting character in the form of Reina (whose character designs were contributed by ''[[City Hunter]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Tsukasa Hojo]]). The film series will be composed of three [[feature films]] and two [[OVA]] movies released between them. The films use a different cast of [[seiyū|voice actors]] than the older anime series, with [[Hiroshi Abe (actor)|Hiroshi Abe]] ([[Kenshiro]]), [[Takashi Ukaji]] ([[Raoh]]), [[Kou Shibasaki]] (Reina) and [[Yuriko Ishida]] (Yuria) in the lead roles. There are no plans for the new movies to be licensed for an English adaptation, although Italian and French versions have already been announced.

==Video games==
{{main|List of Fist of the North Star video games}}
[[Image:Pachinko machine dsc04788.jpg|thumb|A ''Fist of the North Star'' [[pachinko]] machine]]
Several licensed ''Hokuto no Ken'' [[video games]] have been released in Japan thorought the years. The earliest ''Hokuto no Ken'' video game was a 1986 adventure game simply titled ''Hokuto no Ken'', released by [[Enix]] for the [[NEC PC-8801]]. [[Toei Animation]] published many of the early ''Hokuto no Ken'' games for [[Nintendo]] consoles ([[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]], [[Game Boy]] and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]]). In addition, Sega also published their own ''Hokuto no Ken'' action game for the [[Sega SG-1000 Mark III]] (which was later remade for the [[Sony PlayStation 2]] under the [[Sega Ages]] lineup), along with a sequel, ''Hokuto no Ken: Shin Seikimatsu Kyūseishu Densetsu'' for the [[Sega Mega Drive]]. Two of Toei's ''Hokuto no Ken'' games, ''Fist of the North Star'' (''Hokuto no Ken 2'' in Japan) for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] and ''Fist of the North Star: 10 Big Brawls for the King of Universe'' for the Game Boy, were published in North America with the license retained. Both of Sega's ''Hokuto no Ken'' games were published outside Japan as ''[[Black Belt (video game)|Black Belt]]'' and ''[[Last Battle (video game)|Last Battle]]'' respectively, with the ''North Star'' license and character likenesses removed.

In 1995, [[Banpresto]] published an original ''Hokuto no Ken'' adventure game for the [[Sega Saturn]] featuring an original storyline set sometime after the conclusion of the manga. It was ported to the [[Sony PlayStation]] the following year. In 2000, [[Bandai]] published a 3D action game for the PlayStation titled ''Hokuto no Ken: Seikimatsu Kyūseishu Densetsu''.

In addition to original console games, there has also been ''Hokuto no Ken'' arcade games such as [[Konami]]'s ''[[Fighting Mania]]'' boxing game, a [[Fist of the North Star (arcade game)|competitive fighting game]] by [[Arc System Works]] (later released for the [[PlayStation 2]] in Japan) and licensed ''Hokuto no Ken'' "pachislot" machines (hybrid [[pachinko]] and [[slot]] machines) and pachinko machines by [[Sammy]] (which have inspired video game versions for the PlayStation 2, [[PlayStation Portable]], [[Nintendo DS]] and [[Wii]]). A series of ''Hokuto no Ken'' typing games were also made for [[Microsoft Windows]]. A ''Hokuto no Ken Online'' game is in the works.

The characters of ''Hokuto no Ken'' also appeared in two crossover games involving ''[[Shōnen Jump]]'' characters, [[1989 in video gaming|1989's]] ''[[Famicom Jump: Hero Retsuden]]'' for the Famicom and [[2006 in video gaming|2006's]] ''[[Jump Ultimate Stars]]'' for Nintendo DS.
