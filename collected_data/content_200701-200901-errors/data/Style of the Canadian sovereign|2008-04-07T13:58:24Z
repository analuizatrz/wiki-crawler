The '''style of the Canadian sovereign''' is the formal [[Title#Titles for heads of state|title]] and [[Style (manner of address)|style]] of the [[Monarchy of Canada|monarch of Canada]]. The style has varied over the years, changing with Canada's gradual independence from the United Kingdom, the present form dating from 1953.

==Style of the sovereign==
The style of the Canadian monarch, presently [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]], is as follows:

{| class="toccolours" style="margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 10em; background:#D0F0C0; color:black; max-width: 100%;" cellspacing="5"
| style="text-align: left;" | 
* In [[English language|English]]: ''Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom, Canada and Her other Realms and Territories Queen, [[Head of the Commonwealth]], [[Defender of the Faith]].''
* In [[French language|French]]: ''Elizabeth Deux, par la grâce de Dieu Reine du Royaume-Uni, du Canada et de ses autres royaumes et territoires, Chef du Commonwealth, Défenseur de la Foi.''<ref>[http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/fr-rf/titre_e.cfm An Act respecting the Royal Style and Titles]</ref><ref>[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/R-12 Royal Style and Titles Act ( R.S., 1985, c. R-12 )]</ref>
|}

The title mentions Canada separately in order to highlight the monarch's role as Queen of Canada as distinct from that of the United Kingdom (UK) and other Commonwealth realms, as well as the shared aspect of the Crown throughout the realms:<ref name="PT" /> ''Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God '''of''' the United Kingdom, '''Canada''' and Her other Realms and Territories '''Queen''', Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith''. This format was consistent with that of the monarch's titles in the other realms, though, as of [[2006]], only Canada and [[Grenada]] retain this form, all others, besides the UK, having dropped the reference to the United Kingdom.

Although the Queen's Canadian title includes the phrase ''[[Defender of the Faith]] / Défenseur de la Foi'', neither the Queen, nor any of the governors, has any religious role in Canada; there have been no [[established church]]es in Canada since before [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]]. This is one of the key differences from the Queen's role in the United Kingdom, where she is [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]]. [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Louis St. Laurent]] expanded on this topic in his 1953 speech to the House of Commons during debate on the Royal Style and Titles Act:
: "The rather more delicate question arose about the retention of the words defender of the faith. In England there is an established church. In our countries [the other monarchies of the Commonwealth] there are no established churches, but in our countries there are people who have faith in the direction of human affairs by an all-wise Providence; and we felt that it was a good thing that the civil authorities would proclaim that their organisation is such that it is a defence of the continued beliefs in a supreme power that orders the affairs of mere men, and that there could be no reasonable objection from anyone who believed in the Supreme Being in having the sovereign, the head of the civil authority, described as a believer in and a defender of the faith in a supreme ruler."<ref name="Hans" />

Also, while the sovereign holds the nominal title ''[[Head of the Commonwealth]]'', this does not imply any political power over member states of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. In keeping, however, with the declaration of the prime ministers of the Commonwealth in London in 1949 of "the King as the symbol of the free association of its independent member nations and as such the Head of the Commonwealth," the title will pass to the next monarch upon the [[demise of the Crown]].

==History==
[[Image:Const-proc.png|thumb|right|300px|The proclamation of the [[Constitution Act, 1982]], with the full title of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]], [[Monarchy of Canada|Queen of Canada]].]]
The current form of the title was the result of occasional discussion and an eventual meeting of Commonwealth representatives in [[London]] in December of 1952. Prior to this, the title had simply been the same as that in the United Kingdom and, earlier, [[France]]; though, after the 1931 [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] severed legislative ties between Canada and the United Kingdom (UK), the Canadian parliament had to pass its own Royal Style and Titles Act in 1947 to remove the term ''[[Emperor of India]]'' from the King's title in Canada, which became effective, by [[Order-in-Council]], on June 22, 1948.<ref>[http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/hist/dcer/details-en.asp?intRefid=9690 Documents on Canadian External Relations; Volume #14 - 1, Chapter 1, Part I; Royal Style and Titles]</ref>

In the discussions amongst the Commonwealth prime ministers in 1952, Canada's then Prime Minister, Louis St. Laurent, stated that it was important the new title format agreed on by all the realms "emphasize the fact that the Queen is Queen of Canada, regardless of her sovereignty over other Commonwealth countries." Canada's preferred format for the monarch's title was: ''Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God, Queen of Canada and of Her other realms and territories, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith'', similar to the format the government had suggested as early as 1949: ''George the Sixth, by the Grace of God, of Canada and the other nations of the British Commonwealth, King''.<ref>[http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/department/history/dcer/details-en.asp?intRefid=8613 Documents on Canadian External Relations; Volume #15 - 2; Chapter 1, Part 2, Royal Style and Titles]</ref> However, [[Australia]] wished to have the United Kingdom mentioned as well;<ref>[http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/department/history/dcer/details-en.asp?intRefId=3498 Documents on Canadian External Relations; Volume #18 - 2; Chapter 1, Part 2, Royal Style and Titles]</ref> thus, the resolution was a title that included the United Kingdom but, for the first time, also mentioned Canada, and the other [[Commonwealth realm]]s, separately.

When the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]] debated the Queen's title in 1953, St. Laurent asserted on the nature of the separate and shared characteristics of [[the Crown]]: "Her Majesty is now Queen of Canada but she is the Queen of Canada because she is Queen of the United Kingdom... It is not a separate office."<ref name="Hans">[http://www.crht.ca/LibraryShelf/QueenofCanada.html Canadian Royal Heritage Trust], [[Hansard]] [[February 3]], [[1953]], page 1566</ref> After this, the [[Parliament of Canada|Canadian parliament]] passed a new [[Royal Style and Titles Act]], which was granted [[Royal Assent]] and proclaimed by [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Vincent Massey]] on May 29, 1953.<ref name="PT">[http://www.parl.gc.ca/InfoParl/english/issue.htm?param=160&art=287 Trepanier, Peter; ''Canadian Parliamentary Review'': Some Visual Aspects of the Monarchical Tradition; Vol. 27, No. 2; 2004]</ref> A subsequent Royal Style and Titles Act was passed in 1985, though it did not alter the Queen's title in any way.

===Styles used===
From the time of the first settlement of [[Europe]]ans in the territories that today comprise Canada, the monarchs who reigned over the colonies and later the country have used various titles and styles. Starting with the landing of [[John Cabot]] on either [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] or [[Cape Breton Island]], the titles have evolved as follows:

<sub><sup>1</sup> Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]] is regarded as being the first [[List of Canadian monarchs|monarch of Canada]], having created [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] in [[1867]].<br><sup>2</sup> Upon Confederation the [[Government of Canada|newly formed federal government]] was made [[bilingual]].<br><sup>3</sup> As the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]], 1931, disallowed the applicability of any law passed at [[Westminster]] to Canada, the Canadian parliament passes its first separate [[Royal Style and Titles Act]] in 1948 to bring the King's title in Canada in line with the change to his title in the United Kingdom.<br><sup>4</sup> Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] was the first Canadian monarch to be titled as ''Queen of Canada''.</sub>

==Queen of Canada==
The title ''Queen of Canada'' is held by the [[Monarchy of Canada|Canadian monarch]] during the reign of a female sovereign; during the reign of a male sovereign, the title would be changed accordingly to ''King of Canada''.  It is anticipated that upon the [[demise of the Crown]], the current [[heir apparent]], [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]], will be proclaimed King of Canada by the [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada]] (which would then be the King's Privy Council). Prior to the adoption of the Canada-specific title, Canadian monarchs used the style King of the United Kingdom and later King of British Dominions Beyond the Seas. Prime Minister [[John Diefenbaker]] said of the style: "The Queen of Canada is a term which we like to use because it utterly represents her role on this occasion."<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,937945,00.html ''Time'': Royal Visit; October 21, 1957]</ref>

Elizabeth II refers to herself as Queen of Canada when in, or acting abroad on behalf of, Canada.  For example, she stated in 1973: "But it is as Queen of Canada that I am here, Queen of Canada and of all Canadians, not just of one or two ancestral strains."  The federal government and provincial governments now promote the title Queen of Canada, illustrating the separation between Elizabeth II's positions as Queen of Canada and Queen of the United Kingdom.<ref>[http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/about/people/senate//Monarchy/SenMonarchy_15-e.htm Canada: a Constitutional Monarchy]</ref> <ref>[http://canada.gc.ca/howgoc/queen/quind_e.html Biography: Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II Queen of Canada]</ref> <ref>[http://www.gr.gov.sk.ca/protocol/Practice/crown_in_canada.htm The Crown in Canada]</ref>  The style ''Queen of Canada'' is included in the [[Oath of Allegiance (Canada)|Oath of Allegiance]], as well as the [[Oath of citizenship (Canada)|Oath of Citizenship]].

==Highness and majesty==
The use of the styles ''Highness'' and ''Majesty'' originated in the United Kingdom, where they were used from the [[12th century]] onward.  During the reign of [[James I of England|James VI of Scots and I of England and Ireland]], however, ''Majesty'' became the official title, to the exclusion of others.

The style was brought to Canada during colonial times, through usage in reference to the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]], who then had sovereignty over the [[British North America]]n colonies and provinces. Its usage has continued since the country became, according to the [[Department of Canadian Heritage]], a [[Monarchy|kingdom]] in its own right in 1867,<ref>{{cite web

Unlike in the United Kingdom, where the sovereign is referred to in [[treaties]] and on British [[passport]]s as ''Her [His] Britannic Majesty'', the sovereign in Canada is referred to simply as ''Her [His] Majesty'' (Sa Majesté).  However, from time to time, the style will be ''Her [His] Canadian Majesty'' so as to differentiate from foreign sovereigns.{{Fact|date=March 2008}}
