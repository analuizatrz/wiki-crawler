'''Cumacea''' is an [[order (biology)|order]] of small marine [[crustacean]]s, occasionally called '''hooded shrimps'''. Their unique appearance and uniform [[body plan]] makes them easy to distinguish from other crustaceans.

==Anatomy==
[[Image:Cumacea_en.svg|thumb|300px|left|General body plan of a cumacean]]
Cumaceans have a strongly enlarged [[carapace]] (head shield) and [[pereon]] (breast shield), a slim [[abdomen]] and a forked tail. The length of most species varies between 1 and 10&nbsp;[[millimetre|mm]].

The carapace of a typical cumacean is composed of several fused dorsal head parts and the first three [[somite]]s of the [[thorax]]. This carapace encloses the appendages that serve for [[respiratory system|respiration]] and feeding. In most species, there are two eyes at the front side of the head shield, often merged into a single eye lobe. The five posterior somites of the thorax form the pereon. The [[pleon]] (abdomen) consists of six cylindrical somites. 

The first antenna ([[antennula]]) has two [[flagellum|flagella]], the outer flagellum usually being longer than the inner one. The [[antenna (biology)|second antenna]] is strongly reduced in females, and consists of numerous segments in males.

Cumaceans have six pairs of mouthparts: one pair of [[Mandible (arthropod)|mandible]]s, one pair of [[maxillula]], one pair of [[Maxilla (arthropod)|maxilla]]e and three pairs of [[maxilliped]]s.

==Ecology==

Cumaceans are mainly marine crustaceans. However, some species can survive in water with a lower [[salinity]] rate, like in [[brackish water]] (e.g. [[estuary|estuaries]]). In the [[Caspian Sea]] they even reach some rivers that flow into it. Few species live in the [[intertidal zone]].

Most species live only one year or less, and reproduce twice in their lifetime. Deepsea species have a slower [[metabolism]] and presumably live much longer.

Cumaceans feed mainly on [[microorganism]]s and [[organic material]] from the [[sediment]]. Species that live in the mud filter their food, while species that live in sand browse individual grains of sand. In the genus ''Campylaspis'' and a few related genera, the mandibles are transformed into piercing organs, which can be used for [[predation]] on [[Foraminifera|foram]]s and small crustaceans.

Many shallow water species show a [[diurnal animal|diurnal]] cycle, with males emerging from the sediment at night and swarming to the surface.

==Importance==
Like [[Amphipoda]], cumaceans are an important food source for many fishes. Therefore, they are an important part of the marine [[food chain]]. They can be found on all continents.

==Reproduction and development==

Cumaceans are a clear example of [[sexual dimorphism]]: males and females differ significantly in their appearance. Both sexes have different ornaments (setation, knobs, and ridges) on their carapace. Other differences are the length of the second antenna, the existence of [[pleopod]]s in males, and the development of a [[Brood pouch (Peracarida)|marsupium]] in females. There are generally more females than males, and females are also larger than their male counterparts.

Cumaceans are ''[[epimorph]]'', which means that the number of body segments doesn't change during the different developmental stages. This is a form of incomplete [[metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]]. Females carry the embryos in their marsupium for some time. The larvae leave the marsupium during the so-called ''manca''-stadium, in which they are almost fully grown and only miss their last pair of pereopods.

==History of research==
The order of Cumacea was already known since 1780, when [[Ivan Ivanovich Lepekhin]] described the species ''Oniscus scorpioides'' (later renamed to ''Diastylis scorpioides''). During that time, many scientists thought that the cumaceans were some kind of larval stadium of [[Decapoda|decapods]]. In 1846, they were recognized as a separate order by [[Henrik Nikolaj Krøyer]]. Twenty-five years later about fifty different species had been described, and currently there are more that 1,400 described species. German zoologist [[Carl Wilhelm Erich Zimmer]] studied the order Cumacea very intensively.

==Taxonomy==

Cumaceans belong to the superorder of [[Peracarida]], within the class of [[Malacostraca]]. The order of Cumacea is subdivided into 8 to 11 families, and about 120 genera. The families most marine zoologists recognize are:

*[[Bodotriidae]] <small>Scott, 1901</small> (360 species)
*[[Ceratocumatidae]] <small>[[William Thomas Calman|Calman]], 1905</small> (8 species)
*[[Diastylidae]] <small>[[Charles Spence Bate|Bate]], 1856 </small>(281 species)
*[[Gynodiastylidae]] <small>[[Thomas Roscoe Rede Stebbing|Stebbing]], 1912</small> (103 species)
*[[Lampropidae]] <small>[[Georg Sars|Sars]], 1878</small> (90 species)
*[[Leuconidae]] <small>Sars, 1878</small> (121 species)
*[[Nannastacidae]] <small>Bate, 1866</small> (350 species)
*[[Pseudocumatidae]] <small>Sars, 1878</small> (29 species)
