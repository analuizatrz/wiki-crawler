'''Soukous''' (also known as '''Lingala''' or '''Congo''', and previously as '''African rumba''') is a [[musical genre]] that originated in the two neighbouring countries of [[Belgian Congo]] and [[French Congo]] during the 1930s and early 1940s, and which has gained popularity throughout [[Africa]]. "Soukous" (said to be a derivative of the [[French language|French]] word ''secouer'', to shake<ref name="secouer">"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/africabeyond/africaonyourstreet/glossary/ African on your street: Glossary (BBC)]"</ref>) was originally the name of a dance popular in the Congos in the late 1960s, and danced to an African version of [[Cuban Rumba|rumba]]. Although the genre was initially known as rumba (sometimes termed specifically as African rumba), the term "soukous" has come to refer to African rumba and its subsequent developments. 

Soukous is called Congo music in [[West Africa]], and Lingala in [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]] and [[Tanzania]] - referring to the [[Lingala language]] of the region from where it originated. In the 1980s and early 1990s, a fast-paced style of soukous known as [[kwassa kwassa]] &ndash; named after a popular dance, was popular. A style called ndombolo, also named after a dance, is currently popular.

==History==
===Origins===
In the late 1930s and early 1940s, Congolese musicians fused [[Congolese music|Congolese]] and other [[Music of Africa|African traditional music]] with [[Caribbean]] (especially [[Afro-Cuban]], and [[Haitian music]]) and [[South America]]n sounds &ndash; rhythms that were not entirely foreign to the region, having been based - to varying degrees - on musical traditions from the area. This music emerged in the cities of [[Leopoldville]], as [[Kinshasa]] in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC) was then called, and [[Brazzaville]], then capital of the [[French Congo]], now capital of the [[Republic of the Congo]].<ref name="econ">"[http://www.economist.com/world/africa/displayStory.cfm?story_id=2281725 Rumba in the jungle], ''The Economist'', [[December 18]], [[2003]]"</ref> Most of the musicians performed in [[Lingala language]], but some also used [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Tshiluba]] and [[Kikongo]] languages.

===The big bands===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Franco5.jpg||thumb|right|238px|[[Franco Luambo]] & [[TP OK Jazz]]]] -->
[[Antoine Kolosoy]], also known as Papa Wendo, became the first star of African rumba, touring [[Europe]] and [[North America]] in the 1940s and 1950s with his regular band, Victoria Bakolo Miziki.<ref>[http://www.aliaagency.com/artists/artist.php?id=10 Wendo Kolosoyi]</ref>

By the 1950s, [[big band]]s had become the preferred format, using [[acoustic bass guitar]], multiple [[electric guitar]]s, [[conga drum]]s, [[maraca]]s, [[scraper]], [[flute]] or [[clarinet]], [[saxophone]]s, and [[trumpet]]. [[Grand Kalle et l'African Jazz]]" (also known as African Jazz) led by Joseph Kabasele Tshamala ([[Grand Kalle]]), and [[OK Jazz]], later renamed TPOK Jazz (''Tout Puissant Orchestre Kinshasa'', meaning "all-powerful Kinshasa band") led by [[Francois Luambo Makiadi]] became the leading bands.

In the 1950s and 1960s, some artists who performed in the bands of Franco Luambo and Grand Kalle formed their own groups. [[Tabu Ley Rochereau]] and [[Dr Nico Kasanda]] formed [[African Fiesta]] and transformed their music further by fusing Congolese [[folk music]] with [[soul music]], as well as [[Caribbean]] and [[Latin American music|Latin beats]] and [[Musical instrument|instrumentation]]. They were joined by [[Papa Wemba]] and [[Sam Mangwana]], and classics like ''Afrika Mokili Mobimba'' made them one of Africa's greatest bands, rivalled only by TP OK Jazz. Tabu Ley Rochereau and Dr Nico Kasanda are considered the pioneers of modern soukous.

===1960s &ndash; 1970s===
<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Zaiko poster.jpg||thumb|right|238px|[[Zaiko Langa Langa]] concert poster]] -->
While the influence of rumba became stronger in some bands, including [[Lipua-Lipua]], [[Veve (musicians)|Veve]], [[TP OK Jazz]] and [[Bella Bella (musicians)|Bella Bella]], younger Congolese musicians looked for ways to reduce the rumba influence and play a faster paced soukous, inspired by rock n roll.<ref>"[http://www.afropop.org/explore/style_info/ID/16/Congo%20music/ Congo music]", ''Afropop Worldwide''</ref> A group of students calling themselves [[Zaiko Langa Langa]] came together in 1969. The energy of their music, and the high-fashion sense of the singers and dancers, inspired by founding [[Singing|vocalist]] [[Papa Wemba]], made them very popular. [[Pepe Kalle]], a protégé of Grand Kalle, created the band [[Empire Bakuba]] together with [[Papy Tex]], and they soon became Kinshasa's most popular youth band, equaled only by Zaiko Langa Langa.

Other greats of this period include [[Koffi Olomide]], [[Tshala Muana]] and [[Wenge Musica]]. Soukous now spread across Africa and became an influence on virtually all the styles of modern [[Music of Africa|African popular music]], including [[highlife]], [[palm-wine music]], [[taarab]] and [[makossa]].

===The Spread to East Africa in the 1970s===
As political conditions in [[Zaire]], as Congo DRC was known then, deteriorated in the 1970s, some groups made their way to [[Tanzania]] and [[Kenya]]. By the mid-seventies, several Congolese groups were playing soukous at Kenyan night clubs. The lively ''cavacha'', a dance craze that swept East and Central Africa during the seventies, was popularized through [[sound recording|recordings]] of bands such as Zaiko Langa Langa and [[Orchestra Shama Shama]], influencing Kenyan musicians. This rhythm, played on the [[snare drum]] or [[hi-hat]], quickly became a hallmark of the Congolese sound in Nairobi and is frequently used by many of the regional bands. Several of Nairobi's renowned Swahili rumba bands formed around Tanzanian groups like [[Simba Wanyika]] and their offshoots, [[Les Wanyika]] and [[Super Wanyika Stars]].

In the late 1970s, [[Virgin records]] got involved in a couple of projects in Nairobi that produced two acclaimed [[gramophone record|LP]]s from the Tanzanian-Congolese group, [[Orchestra Makassy]] and the Kenya-based band, [[Super Mazembe]]. One of the tracks from this album was the Swahili song ''Shauri Yako'' (meaning "it's your problem), which became a hit in Kenya, Tanzania and [[Uganda]]. About this same time, the Nairobi-based Congolese vocalist [[Samba Mapangala]] and his band [[Orchestra Virunga]], released the LP ''Malako'', which became one of the pioneering releases of the newly emerging [[world music]] scene in Europe.<ref>[http://members.aol.com/dpaterson/Mapngala.htm Samba Mapangala and Orchestra Virunga], by Douglas B. Paterson</ref> The musical style of the East Africa-based Congolese bands gradually incorporated new elements, including Kenyan [[benga]] music, and spawned what is sometimes called the "Swahili sound" or "Congolese sound".

===The 1980s and the Paris scene===
In the 1980s soukous became popular in [[London]] and [[Paris]]. A few more musicians left Kinshasa to work around central and east Africa before settling in either the UK or France. The basic line-up for a soukous band included three or four [[guitar]]s, [[bass guitar]], [[Drum kit|drums]], [[Brass instrument|brass]], [[Singing|vocals]], and some of them having over 20 musicians. [[Lyrics]] were often in Lingala and occasionally in [[French language|French]]. In the late 1980s and 1990s, [[Paris]]ian studios were used by many soukous stars, and the music became heavily reliant on [[synthesizer]]s and other [[Electronic musical instrument|electronic instruments]]. Some artists continued to record for the Congolese market, but others abandoned the demands of the Kinshasa public and set out to pursue new audiences. Some, like Paris-based [[Papa Wemba]] maintained two bands, [[Viva la Musica]] for soukous, and a group including French session players for international pop. 

[[Kanda Bongo Man]], another Paris-based artist, pioneered fast, short tracks suitable for play on dance floors everywhere and popularly known as ''[[Kwassa kwassa]]'' after the dance moves popularized by his and other artists' [[music video]]s. This music appealed to Africans and to new audiences as well. Artists like [[Diblo Dibala]], [[Mbilia Bel]], [[Yondo Sister]], [[Loketo]], [[Rigo Star]], [[Madilu System]], [[Soukous Stars]] and veterans like [[Pepe Kalle]] and [[Koffi Olomide]] followed suit. Soon Paris became home to talented studio musicians who recorded for the African and Caribbean markets and filled out bands for occasional tours.

===Ndombolo===
The fast soukous music currently dominating dance floors in central, eastern and western Africa is called soukous ndombolo, performed by [[Dany Engobo]], [[Awilo Longomba]], [[Aurlus Mabele]], [[Koffi Olomide]] and groups like Extra Musica, Wenge Musica among others.

The hip-swinging, booty-shaking dance to the fast pace of soukous ndombolo has come under criticism amid charges that it is obscene. There have been attempts to ban it in [[Mali]], [[Cameroon]] and [[Kenya]]. After an attempt to ban it from state radio and television in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2000, it became even more popular. In February, [[2005]] ndombolo music videos in the DR Congo were censored for indecency, and video clips by Koffi Olomide, [[JB M'Piana]] and [[Werrason]] were banned from the airwaves.<ref name="ndb1">"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/851033.stm Anger at Cameroon dance ban; BBC News]", ''BBC News'', [[July 25]], [[2000]]</ref><ref name="ndb2">"[http://news.lifestyle.co.uk/entertainment/55087-entertainment.htm Ndombolo music videos in DR Congo censored for indecency], ''Lifestyle News'', [[11 February]] [[2005]]"</ref><ref name="ndb3">"[http://www.nationaudio.com/News/DailyNation/1998/111098/Features/Lifestyle8.html Why is this 'Ndombolo' generating so much heat?]", ''Daily Nation (Kenya)'' [[October 11]], [[1998]]</ref>
