After releasing several albums, he transitioned into films, with lead roles in several [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] films, including ''[[Waist Deep]]'', ''[[2 Fast 2 Furious]]'', ''[[Flight of the Phoenix (2004 film)|Flight of the Phoenix]]'', ''[[Four Brothers (film)|Four Brothers]]'', ''[[Baby Boy (film)|Baby Boy]]'', and ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]''. 

==Biography==
===Early life===
Tyrese Gibson was born in South Central[[ Los Angeles]]. His mother, Priscilla Murray Gibson ([[married and maiden names|née]] Durham), raised him and his three older siblings as a single parent after Gibson's father left in [[1983]].<ref name="scripps">{{cite web | title=Scripps Howard News Service | work=Tyrese Gibson on getting my grown man on | url=http://www.shns.com/shns/g_index2.cfm?action=detail&pk=GIBSON-FILM-06-21-06 | accessmonthday=June 21 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

Gibson's career began when he won a talent show at the age of fourteen. An appearance in a [[1998]] [[Coca-Cola]] advertisement, singing the phrase "Always Coca-Cola",<ref name="baller">{{cite web | title=BallerStatus | work=Tyrese: Waist Deep | url=http://www.ballerstatus.net/beyond/read/id/04270158/ | accessmonthday=June 19 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> led to wider fame, and at seventeen looks paved the way for him to model for [[Tommy Hilfiger]].

===Music career===
Initially an [[rapper|MC]], Tyres performed under the alias of ''Black-Ty'' and was a member of an underground group called ''Triple Impact''.<ref name="baller"/> He decided to take the opportunity to launch a career in [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]]. Tyrese released his [[Tyrese (album)| self-titled debut album]], which went [[Platinum single|platinum]], in [[1998]].<ref name="scripps" /> His second album, ''[[2000 Watts]]'', shares the name of the organization he founded to help inner city children. Gibson sang background vocals in [[Tupac Shakur|Tupac]]'s "Never Call You Bitch Again", and co-wrote the song "2000 watts" for Michael Jackson's 2001 album ''[[Invincible (Michael Jackson album)| Invincible]]'' with [[Teddy Riley]] and [[Michael Jackson|The King of Pop]].

Tyrese says he prefers his music career to acting,<ref name="scripps" /> but will continue to focus on both areas. He released the album ''[[Alter Ego]]'' on [[December 12]] [[2006]], with one disc featuring [[R&B]] (as Tyrese) and one disc featuring [[hip hop music|hip hop]] (as Black-Ty).<ref name="baller" /> 

In 2007, Gibson decided to be an independent recording artist and got out his contract with [[J Records]]. This is the first time in his musical career in which he was not signed to a label.

He has also started his own company, Headquarter Entertainment. This is a multi-faceted company, and features new artist Life Nine and his producers The Frontline Boyz.

Gibson was picked as one of [[People Magazine]]'s ''Sexiest Men of the Year'' in [[2000]].

===TGT===
Tyrese Gibson has been attached to a new R&B supergroup called [[TGT (group)|TGT]] with [[Ginuwine]] and [[Tank (singer)|Tank]]. He is quoted as saying "With all the support our fans have given us individually over the years for our distinct signature styles, collectively we felt our fans deserved to hear great music in a way that they could never have imagined.  I've known these guys for years and they truly are like brothers, so it only felt right to come together as a trio to make history". The group is first featured on Tank's remix to the song "Please Don't Go". They also plan an international tour entitled "The Shirts Off Tour" which is set to start in February 2008.<ref>[http://hiphop.popcrunch.com/tyrese-ginuwine-tank-form-rb-group-tgt/ Tyrese, Ginuwine, Tank Form R&B Group TGT | Hip-Hop Crunch]</ref>

===Acting===
Gibson was given the role originally intended for [[Tupac Shakur]] in the 2001 film ''[[Baby Boy (film)|Baby Boy]]'', and he subsequently appeared in the 2003 film ''[[2 Fast 2 Furious]]'' (opposite [[Paul Walker]] with whom he formed a close friendship), as well as ''[[Flight of the Phoenix (2004 film)|Flight of the Phoenix]]'' (2004), ''[[Four Brothers (film)|Four Brothers]]'' (2005) and ''[[Annapolis (film)|Annapolis]]'' (2006).

In 2006, Tyrese starred in ''[[Waist Deep]]''; his co-stars in the film, [[Meagan Good]] and [[Larenz Tate]], are personal friends of Gibson's in real life.<ref name="baller" /> Like several of his previous roles, the film is set in an urban environment, but Gibson has said that he does not view the role as a "step back", rather seeing the film as taking "another direction" due to some of its themes and action sequences.<ref name="baller" />

His most recent role was in the action film, ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]''. The film's director, [[Michael Bay]], had Gibson in mind for the role before he was cast, and thus Gibson did not have to audition for the part.<ref name="movieweb">{{cite web | title=MovieWeb | work=INTERVIEW: Tyrese Gibson Gets In Waist Deep | url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/19/13219.php | accessmonthday=June 21 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Gibson may also star in a film version of the superhero [[Luke Cage]]; as of 2006, the script was being re-formatted.<ref name="movieweb" />

In 2008, he reprised his role [[Air Force]] Technical Sergeant Robert Epps in ''[[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen]]''.

===Fear of owls===
During a 2003 appearance on the New Tom Green Show it was revealed that Gibson has an immense fear of owls. On the show he confessed that he has such a fear of owls that looking at a picture would make him "freak out". Knowing this, [[Tom Green]] began to draw a picture of an owl causing Gibson to go into a panic and threaten to leave the stage.<ref name="IMDb">{{cite web | title=IMDb | work=Tyrese Gibson mini bio | url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0879085/bio | accessmonthday=June 15 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>
