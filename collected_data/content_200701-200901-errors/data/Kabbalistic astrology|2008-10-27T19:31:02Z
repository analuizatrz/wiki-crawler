'''Kabbalistic astrology''' (called '''''Mazal''''' or '''''Mazalot''''' ["zodiac," "destiny"] in the Kabbalistic tradition) is a system of [[astrology]] based upon the Hebrew [[Kabbalah]]; it is used to interpret and delineate a person's [[Natal chart|birth chart]], seeking to understand it through a Kabbalistic lens. In Hebrew, astrology was called ''hokmat ha-nissayon'', "the wisdom of prognostication", in distinction to ''hokmat ha-hizzayon'' (wisdom of star-seeing, or [[astronomy]]). Although Kabbalah is part of the mystical Jewish tradition, its use of astrology does not represent the complete [[Jewish views of astrology]], which have been both positive and negative, depending on the authority. 

The inner structure of the soul is reflected in the Kabbalah [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]]. A trestleboard is used to chart the placements of the various planets and signs of the [[zodiac]]. 

Most [[astrologer]]s cast and use a [[horoscope]], which is translated as ‘a view of time’ to depict planetary placements which serve to influence our daily activities. For example, the [[square horoscope]] was used extensively until the [[Middle Ages]] when it was replaced by the circular version which was more clearly representative of the orbital paths of the celestial bodies that were observed. Cabalistic astrologers tend to take a slightly different approach because they wish to observe the [[planet]]s as they relate to each sephira in the Tree of Life. Therefore, the [[Sun sign|sign]] and house placement is written on the associated node of the trestleboard. 

Each sephira points to a specific character trait which helps us to identify exactly where we are in our evolutionary path to enlightenment. Each sephira in the testleboard corresponds with a specific planet and is therefore closely aligned with the celestial art of astrology. The meanings of the ten sephiroth, to include the eleventh imaginary one, are as follows:-
