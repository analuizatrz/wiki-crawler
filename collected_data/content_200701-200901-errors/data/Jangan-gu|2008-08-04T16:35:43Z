'''Jangan-gu''', established on [[July 1]], [[1988]], is the northern district of the city of [[Suwon]] in [[Gyeonggi-do]], [[South Korea]].

==Geography==
Jangan-gu lies in the north of [[Suwon]]. It is bordered by [[Uiwang]] to the north-west, [[Yongin]] to the north and east, [[Yeongtong-gu]] to the south-east, [[Paldal-gu]] to the south and [[Gwonseon-gu]] to the south west.

Jangan-gu's northern border, with [[Yongin]], is the mountain of [[Gwanggyosan]].  At 582 metres above [[sea level]],<ref name="Gwanggyosan">{{cite web|url=http://www.koreasanha.net/san/gwanggyo.htm|title=한국의 산하 - 광교산 (''Hangugui Sanha - Gwanggyosan'')|work=Korean mountaineering association website|accessdate=2007-08-07}}</ref> this is [[Suwon|Suwon's]] highest point.

Most of the streams passing through Suwon originate in Jangan-gu, on [[Gwanggyosan]] or other nearby peaks. Since [[Suwon]] is bounded to the east by other hills, the streams, chiefly the [[Suwoncheon]], flow southwards through the city, eventually emptying into the [[Yellow Sea]] at [[Asan Bay]]. The entirety of [[Suwon]] is drained in this manner.
