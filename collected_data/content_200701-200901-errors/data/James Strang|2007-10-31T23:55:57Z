'''James Jesse Strang''' ([[March 21]] [[1813]] &ndash; [[July 9]] [[1856]]) was a leader in the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] during and after the [[Succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)|1844 succession crisis]]. He became the founder and [[Prophet, seer and revelator|prophet]] of the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite)]], one of many sects that claim to be a continuation of the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]] founded by [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] in 1830.  He equally served as the crowned  "king" of an ecclesiastical monarchy that existed for six years within the U.S. state of [[Michigan]].

Strang taught that his office embodied an overtly royal attribute, by which he was to be not only a prophet to his people, but their [[king]], as well.<ref>Strang 1856, pp.168-76.</ref><ref>"[http://www.mormonbeliefs.com/strang,_the_king.htm Strang, the King]". ''MormonBeliefs.com''. Retrieved on [[2007-10-28]].</ref> He ultimately offered a highly-developed set of teachings that differed in many significant aspects from any other kind of Mormonism,{{fn|(a)}} including that preached by Joseph Smith himself.  Strang was also at various times a lawyer, teacher, temperance lecturer, correspondent for the ''[[New York Tribune]]'', newspaper editor, [[Baptist]] minister, and an amateur scientist whose study of [[Beaver Island (Lake Michigan)|Beaver Island's]] natural history was published by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and remained the definitive work on the subject for nearly a century.<ref name=Weeks>Weeks, Robert P. (June 1970). [http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1970/4/1970_4_4.shtml "For His Was the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory...Briefly]". ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]'' '''21''' (4).</ref>

As a complement to his prophetic claims, James Strang published purported translations of two allegedly long-lost works: the [[Voree plates|Voree Record]], said to have been translated from three tiny metal plates unearthed in response to a vision; and the [[Book of the Law of the Lord]], said to be a translation of a portion of the [[Laban (Book of Mormon)|Plates of Laban]] that figure prominently in parts of [[The Book of Mormon]].  These books are accepted as scripture by his followers, but not by members of any other Mormon sect.

==Summary of Latter Day Saint leadership==
James Strang was [[baptised]] and [[confirmed]] by Joseph Smith, Jr. as a member of the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] on [[February 25]] [[1844]] in [[Nauvoo]], [[Illinois]]. On [[March 3]] of that same year, he was ordained an [[Elder (Latter Day Saints)|Elder]] by [[Hyrum Smith]], Joseph's brother. Shortly after the [[Death of Joseph Smith, Jr.|murder]] of Joseph Smith on June 27, 1844, Strang announced that he had been appointed by Smith to take over leadership of the church.  His claims were quickly rejected by ten of Smith's [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|Twelve Apostles]], who held the support of a majority of church leaders and members in Nauvoo. 

[[Image:VoreeChurch.jpg|thumb|px255|left| Strangite church building in [[Voree, Wisconsin]]. (2005)]]

Strang immediately set about relocating his adherents to [[Voree, Wisconsin|Voree]], [[Wisconsin]], just outside present-day [[Burlington]], which his purported "[[Letter of Appointment (Mormonism)|Letter of Appointment]]" named as the new "gathering place" for the Latter Day Saints. In 1848, Strang created a second [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|stake]] on [[Beaver Island (Lake Michigan)|Beaver Island]] in [[Lake Michigan]], where he moved his church headquarters and was ultimately proclaimed the spiritual "king" of his people in 1850&ndash;but never of the island itself.<ref>Fitzpatrick, pg. 199.</ref>

Although Strang had been a Mormon for barely four months at Joseph Smith's death, several prominent Saints, including members of Smith's family, accepted his claims for a time.  The most noteworthy of these included four of the eleven [[Book of Mormon witnesses|"witnesses"]] to The Book of Mormon,{{fn|(b)}} three of Joseph Smith's [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostles]],{{fn|(c)}} a leading [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishop]] of his church,{{fn|(d)}} <ref>Fitzpatrick, pp. 159-75.</ref> and Smith's own mother and wife (see below).  Nearly all of these would ultimately repudiate his leadership, however, mostly due to his eventual sanctioning of [[polygamy]].

While Strang's church suffered persecution on Beaver Island, it continued to grow, steadily gaining converts from other Mormon sects until his assassination at the hands of two disgruntled members. The day prior to his death, a mob from nearby [[Mackinac Island]] invaded Beaver Island and forcibly removed all of Strang's followers, dumping them&ndash;minus their property&ndash;at various ports on Lake Michigan. While most of Strang's disciples later joined the [[Community of Christ|Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]], a small but devout remnant still practices his teachings today.

Strang's sect is formally referred to as the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite)|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]].{{fn|(e)}} During the nineteenth century, followers of [[Brigham Young]] were often referred to by those not of their church as "Brighamites," while those of [[Sidney Rigdon]] were known as "Rigdonites," and disciples of Strang were generally known as "Strangites".{{fn|(f)}} <ref name=Strangite>"[http://www.mormonbeliefs.com/Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter%20Day%20Saints%20(Strangite).htm Church of Jesus Christ of Ladder Day Saints]". ''MormonBeliefs.com''. Retrieved on [[2007-10-28]].</ref>  Thus the appendage "Strangite" is often added to their name, though it is not part of the official title of Strang's church.

==Childhood, education and conversion==
James Jesse Strang was born [[March 21]] [[1813]], in [[Scipio, New York|Scipio]], [[Cayuga County, New York]]. He was the second of three children, and his parents had a good reputation in their community.  James' mother was very tender with him as a consequence of delicate health, yet she required him to render an account of all his actions and words while absent from her.<ref>Post, Warren. "[http://www.strangstudies.org/James_Jesse_Strang History of James Strang: The Birth and Parentage of the Prophet James]". ''StrangStudies.org''. Retrieved on [[2007-10-28]].</ref>  In a brief autobiography he wrote in 1855, Strang reported that he had attended grade school until age twelve, but that "the terms were usually short, the teachers inexperienced and ill qualified to teach, and my health such as to preclude attentive study or steady attendance."  He estimated that he had spent a total of six months of actual time in class.<ref>"[http://www.mormonbeliefs.com/strang,_the_man.htm Strang, the Man]". ''MormonBeliefs.com''. Retrieved on [[2007-10-31]]</ref>  

But none of this meant that Strang was illiterate or simple.  Although his teachers "not unfrequently turned me off with little or no attention, as though I was too stupid to learn and too dull to feel neglect," Strang would recall that "long weary days I sat upon the floor, thinking, thinking, thinking....my mind wandered over fields that old men shrink from, seeking rest and finding none till darkness gathered thick around and I burst into tears."<ref>"[http://www.mormonbeliefs.com/strang,_the_man.htm Strang, the Man]". ''MormonBeliefs.com''. Retrieved on [[2007-10-31]]</ref> He studied works by [[Thomas Paine]] and the [[Comte de Volney]],<ref name=Weeks/> whose book ''Les Ruines'' exerted a significant influence on the future prophet.<ref>Fitzpatrick, pp. 26-27.</ref> 

During his formative years, Strang was the author of a rather profound personal diary, written partly in a secret code that was not deciphered until over one hundred years after it was authored (ironically, by Strang's own grandson Mark Strang, a banker in Long Beach, California).  This journal contains Strang's musings on a variety of topics, including his desire to "rival [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] or [[Napoleon]]" and his regret that by age nineteen, he had not yet become a [[general]] or member of the [[state legislature]], which he saw as being essential by that point in his life to his own quest for fame.<ref>Strang, Mark. 
(1961). ''The Diary of James J. Strang: Deciphered, Transcribed, Introduced, and Annotated''. East Lansing: Michigan State University Press. Entry for [[March 21]] [[1832]].</ref>  However, Strang's diary equally reveals a sincere desire to be of service to his fellow man, together with agonized frustration at not knowing how he might be able to do so as a penniless, unknown youth from upstate New York.  

At 12 years old, Strang was baptised as a Baptist.  He did not wish to follow his father's career as a farmer, and so took up the study of civil law.  Strang was admitted to the bar in [[New York]] at age 23 and later at other places where he resided. He became County [[Postmaster]] and edited a local newspaper.  Later, in the midst of myriad duties as the leader of his church on Beaver Island, he would find time to found and edit the ''Daily Northern Islander'', the first newspaper in all of northern Michigan.<ref>Fitzpatrick, pg. 208.</ref>

Strang, who had once described himself as a "cool philosopher"<ref name=Weeks/> and a [[freethinker]], became a Baptist [[minister of religion|minister]] but ultimatetly left to join the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] in 1844. Strang quickly found favor with Joseph Smith, though they had known each other only a short time, and was baptized personally by him.<ref>Fitzpatrick, pg. 27.</ref><ref>Greene, John P. (Nauvoo City Marshal in 1844). "[http://www.strangite.org/Famous.htm 150 people who each knew more about Joseph Smith than anyone alive today]." ''Strangite.org'', item 48. Retrieved on [[2007-10-28]].</ref>  Immediately ordained an Elder, he was sent forthwith at Smith's request to Wisconsin, to establish a Mormon [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|stake]] at [[Voree, Wisconsin|Voree]], just outside modern [[Burlington, Wisconsin|Burlington]].  Shortly after Strang's departure, Joseph Smith was murdered by an anti-Mormon mob in [[Carthage, Illinois]].

==Succession claim and notable early allies==
{{Main|Succession crisis}}

Following Smith's murder, [[Brigham Young]], Strang, and several others claimed to be Smith's successor. A power struggle ensued, and Young eventually led the bulk of Smith's followers to [[Utah Territory|Utah]].  Although the Quorum of Twelve published a notice in the ''[[Times and Seasons]]'' of Strang's excommunication,<ref>''Times and Seasons'', Vol. V., No. 16, September 2, 1844. http://www.centerplace.org/history/ts/v5n16.htm.</ref> Strang insisted that a trial had never been held as church law required.  He equally asserted that the Twelve had no right to sit in judgment on him, as he was the lawful President of the church.<ref>''Gospel Herald'', Vol. III, No. 22, August 17, 1848. http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/IA/JStrang2.htm</ref>

Strang's evidence for his claim included an alleged "Letter of Appointment" from Smith, postmarked a week before his death: "[[Nauvoo]], [[June 19]] [[1844]]." Strang furthermore testified that an [[angel]] appointed him as Joseph Smith's successor at the time Smith died.  Smith and Strang were some 200 miles (320 km) apart at the time, and Strang insisted that witnesses could affirm that he made his announcement before news of Smith's murder was publicly available.<ref>Strang 1854b, pg. 23.</ref>

[[Image:Johnepage.jpg|right|thumb|[[John E. Page]], an [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|Apostle]] under [[Joseph Smith, Jr.|Joseph Smith]] and James Strang.]]

The letter from Smith to Strang is held today by [[Yale University]]. Although the [[postmark]] is legitimate, modern forensic analysis has asserted that Joseph Smith's signature on the second page&mdash;the one appointing Strang as Smith's successor&mdash;is a [[forgery]].<ref>Quinn, pg. 210.</ref>  One former Strangite claimed to have conspired with Strang to fabricate his Letter of Appointment and his [[Voree Plates]], though no proof of this was ever produced.<ref>Nelson-Seawright, J. ([[27 October]] [[2006]]). "[http://www.bycommonconsent.com/2006/10/the-prophet-jesse-james/ The Prophet Jesse James]".  ''ByCommonConsent.com''. Retrieved on [[2007-10-28]].</ref>

Strang's letter convinced several eminent Mormons of his claims. Book of Mormon witnesses [[John Whitmer|John]] and [[David Whitmer]], [[Martin Harris]] and [[Hiram Page]], Apostles [[John E. Page]], [[William E. M'Lellin]], and [[William Smith (Mormonism)|William Smith]], Smith's sisters, his widow [[Emma Hale Smith]], Nauvoo Stake President [[William Marks (Mormonism)|William Marks]], Bishop [[George Miller (Latter Day Saints)|George Miller]], and Joseph Smith's mother, [[Lucy Mack Smith]], with others, accepted Strang at first. Lucy Smith wrote to one Reuben Hedlock: "I am satisfied that Joseph appointed J.J. Strang. It is verily so."<ref name=11May46>(Nauvoo, [[11 May]] [[1846]]).  "[http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/IA/JStrang1.htm#050046 Opinions of the Smith Family]". ''Voree Herald'' '''I''' (6). Retrieved on [[2007-10-28]].<br>'''''a''''': Letter of Lucy Smith to Reuben Hedlock.<br>

[[Image:John C. Bennett engraving.jpg|left|thumb|Engraving of [[John C. Bennett]] as a General of the [[Nauvoo Legion]].]]

Also championing Strang at first was [[John C. Bennett]], a physician and [[libertine]] who had enjoyed a less than stellar career as Joseph Smith's [[Assistant President of the Church|Assistant President]] and mayor of Nauvoo.  Invited by Strang to join him in Voree,<ref>Fitzpatrick, pp. 146-7.</ref> Bennett was instrumental in establishing a short-lived "Order of the [[Illuminati]]" there, with Strang as "Imperial Primate."<ref name=Weeks/>  Eventually Bennett's prolifigate ways caught up with him, as in Nauvoo, and Strang expelled him in 1847.<ref>Fitzpatrick, pg. 151.</ref> His "order" fell by the wayside, and has no role in Strangite doctrine or practice today. 

==From monogamist to polygamist==
In all, about 12,000 Latter-day saints accepted Strang's claims.<ref>"[http://www.strangite.org/History.htm History and Succession]". ''Strangite.org''. Retrieved on [[2007-10-28]].</ref> However, not all would follow him to Beaver Island in [[Lake Michigan]], where Strang's headquarters was moved in 1848.  Most of his initial followers, including all of those listed above (with the exception of George Miller, who remained loyal to Strang until death), would leave Strang's church before his death. Some eventually followed Brigham Young, but Smith's immediate family never recognized Young's leadership, and many of them formed the [[Community of Christ|Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] a few years later.  

Several of these defections were due to Strang's seemingly abrupt "about-face" on the turbulent subject of polygamy.  Vehemently opposed to the practice at first,<ref>([[August 12]] [[1847]]). ''Voree Herald'' as quoted in Fitzpatrick, pp. 74-5.  See also Apostle John E. Page at this same source, on his conversations with Strang on the subject. </ref> Strang reversed course in 1849 to become one of its strongest advocates, marrying a total of five wives (including his original spouse) and fathering a total of fourteen children.

Strang's defense of polygamy was rather unique.  He claimed that, far from enslaving or demeaning women, it would ''liberate'' and "elevate" them by allowing them to choose the best possible mate based upon any factors deemed important to them--even if that mate were already married to someone else.  Rather than being forced to wed "corrupt and degraded sires" due to the scarcity of more suitable men, a woman could marry the man she saw as the most compatible to herself, the best candidate to father her children and the man who could give her the finest possible life, no matter how many other wives he might have.<ref>Strang 1856, pp. 318-28.</ref>

Strang's first wife was Mary Perce, whom he married on [[November 20]] [[1836]], when she was eighteen and he was twenty-three.  They were separated in May of 1851, though they remained legally married until Strang's death.<ref name=Fitz-82>Fitzpatrick, pg. 82.</ref>  His second wife, married on [[July 13]] [[1849]], was nineteen-year old Elvira Eliza Field (who disguised herself at first as "Charlie J. Douglas," Strang's purported nephew, before revealing her true identity in 1850).  Strang's third wife was thirty-one year old Betsy McNutt, whom he married on [[January 19]] [[1852]]; his fourth was nineteen-year old Sarah Adelia Wright, married on [[July 15]] [[1855]].  Ironically, decades after Strang's death, Sarah would divorce her second husband, one Dr. Wing, due to ''his'' interest in polygamy.<ref>Fitzpatrick, pg. 127.</ref>  Strang's last wife was eighteen-year old Phoebe Wright, cousin to Sarah, whom he married on [[October 27]] [[1855]], less than one year before his murder.  

Sarah Wright would later describe Strang as "a very mild-spoken, kind man to his family, although his word was law."  She further indicated that while each wife had her own bedroom, they all shared meals and prayer time together with Strang and that family life in their household was generally "as pleasant as possible."<ref name=Weeks/><ref name=Fitz-82/>  On the other hand, Strang and Phoebe Wright's daughter, Eugenia, wrote in 1936 that after only eight months of marriage, Phoebe had "begun to feel dissatisfied with polygamy, though she loved him [Strang] devotedly all her life."<ref>Fitzpatrick, pg. 84.</ref>

==Theological contributions to Mormonism==
===Translations===
Like Joseph Smith, James Strang reported numerous visions, unearthed and translated ancient metal plates using the [[Urim and Thummim]], and claimed to have restored long-lost spiritual knowledge to humankind.  Furthermore, like Smith, Strang presented witnesses to authenticate the ancient records he claimed to have received.<ref>Weeks, pp. iv, 250.</ref>

Unlike Smith, however, Strang offered ''his'' plates to the curious public for examination. The non-Mormon [[Christopher Sholes]] (inventor of the first practical typewriter, and a later inspiration to [[Thomas Edison]]), editor of the ''Southport Telegraph'', examined Strang's "[[Voree Plates]]", a set of three tiny brass plates Strang claimed to have discovered in 1845 as the result of a vision he had seen.<ref name=Plates/> Sholes offered no opinion of the plates themselves, but described Strang as "honest and earnest" and opined that Strang's followers ranked "among the most honest and intelligent men in the neighborhood."<ref>Fitzpatrick, pg.36.</ref>

Strang's translation of these metal plates was published as the "Voree Record", purporting to be the last testament of one "Rajah Manchou of Vorito", who had lived in the area centuries earlier and wished to leave a brief record for posterity.  Two modern non-Mormon scholars have declared that the text on the plates appears to represent a genuine, albeit unknown, language. The Voree Plates disappeared around 1900, and their current whereabouts is unknown.<ref name=Plates>A drawing of these plates, with translation and testimony of their discovery, may be found at James J. Strang. (1845). "[http://www.strangite.org/Plates.htm The Record of Rajah Manchou of Vorito.]" ''Strangite.org''. Retrieved on [[2007-10-28]].</ref>

Strang also claimed to have translated the "[[Plates of Laban]]" described in the [[Book of Mormon]].<ref>I Nephi 3:1-5:22 (Book of Mormon).</ref>  His translation of these "plates" was published in 1851 as the [[Book of the Law of the Lord]], said to be the original Law given to Moses and mentioned in II Chronicles 34:14-15.<ref>"[http://www.mormonbeliefs.com/book_of_the_law.htm Book of the Law]". ''MormonBeliefs.com''. Retrieved on [[2007-10-28]].</ref>  Greatly expanded and republished in 1856, this book would serve as the constitution for Strang's spiritual kingdom on Beaver Island, and is still accepted as scripture by Strangites.  One distinctive feature (besides its overtly monarchial tone) is its claimed restoration of a "missing" commandment to the [[Ten Commandments|Decalogue]]: ''"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."''  Strang  insisted that versions of the Decalogue found in Bibles used by other churches--including other Mormon churches--contain only ''nine'' commandments, not ten.<ref>Strang 1856, pp. 38-46.</ref>   

Strang claimed to have received a number of other revelations, which while never formally added to his church's [[Doctrine and Covenants]], are nevertheless accepted as valid by his followers.<ref>These revelations may be read at http://www.strangite.org/Reveal.htm.</ref>  These concerned, among other things, Baptism for the Dead, the building of a temple in Voree, and an invitation for [[Joseph Smith III]], eldest son of the murdered Joseph Smith, Jr., to take a position as a [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|Counselor]] in Strang's [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]].{{fn|(g)}}

===Distinctive dogmas===
Some of Strang's teachings differed substantially from those of other Mormon leaders, including Joseph Smith.  For instance, Strang rejected both the traditional Christian doctrine of the [[Virgin Birth]] of [[Jesus Christ]] ''and'' the Mormon doctrine of "[[plurality of gods]]."  A [[monotheist]], he insisted that there was but one eternal [[God]] of all the universe, the [[God the Father|Father]], and that "[[Exaltation (Latter Day Saints)|progression to godhood]]" (a doctrine allegedly taught by Joseph Smith toward the end of his life)<ref>Smith, Joseph (Sunday, [[April 7]] [[1844]]). "[http://www.utlm.org/onlineresources/sermons_talks_interviews/kingfolletsermon.htm King Follett Sermon]" as printed in ''History of the Church'' '''6''': pp. 302-17. Excerpt at ''utlm.org''. Retrieved on [[2007-10-28]].</ref> was impossible.  God had always been God, said Strang, and He was but one Person (not three, as in the traditional Christian [[Trinity]]).<ref>Strang 1856, pp. 47-63.</ref>  Jesus Christ, said Strang, was the natural-born son of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]], who was chosen from before all time to be the Savior of mankind, but who had to be born as an ordinary mortal of two human parents (rather than being the offspring of the Father or the [[Holy Spirit]]) to be able to truly fulfill his Messianic role.<ref>Strang 1856, pp. 157-8, note 9.</ref>  Strang claimed that the earthly Christ was in essence "adopted" as God's son at birth, and fully revealed as such during the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]].<ref>Strang 1856, pp. 165-6.</ref>  After proving himself to God by living a perfectly sinless life, he was enabled to provide an acceptable sacrifice for the sins of men, prior to his [[Resurrection appearances of Jesus|resurrection]] and [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|ascension]].<ref>Strang 1856, pp. 155-8.</ref> 

Furthermore, Strang denied that God could do ''all'' things, and insisted that some things were as impossible for Him as for us.<ref>Strang 1856, pg. 150.</ref>  Thus, he saw no essential conflict between science and religion, and while he never openly championed [[Introduction to evolution|evolution]], he did state that God was limited in His power by both the [[matter]] He was working with and by the eons of time required to "organize" and shape it.<ref>Strang 1856, pp. 150-1.</ref>  He spoke glowingly of a future generation who would "make religion a science," to be "studied by as exact rules as mathematicks."  "The mouth of the Seer will be opened," Strang prophesied, "and the whole earth enlightened."<ref>Strang 1856, pg. 85.  Spelling of "mathematicks" as in original.</ref>

Musing at length on the nature of [[sin]] and [[evil]], Strang wrote that of all things that God could give to man, He could never give him ''experience''.<ref>Strang 1856, pp. 152-3.</ref>  Thus, if "[[Agency (LDS Church)|free agency]]" were to be real, said Strang, humanity must be given the opportunity to fail and to learn from its own mistakes.  The ultimate goal for each human being was to willingly conform oneself to the revealed character of God in every respect, preferring good to evil not out of a fear of punishment or any desire for reward, but rather solely "on account of the innate loveliness of undefiled goodness; of pure unalloyed holiness."<ref>Strang 1856, pg. 155.</ref>

===Practices===
Strang believed strongly in the [[Saturday]] [[Sabbath]], and enjoined it in lieu of [[Sunday]];<ref>Strang 1856, pp.22-3.</ref> the Strangite church continues this tradition.  He advocated [[baptism for the dead]], and practiced it to a limited extent in Voree and on Beaver Island.  He also introduced [[animal sacrifice]], not for sin or guilt, but rather as a part of Strangite celebration rituals.<ref>Strang 1856, pp. 106-9, 293-5.</ref>  Animal sacrifices and baptisms for the dead are not currently practiced by the Strangite organization, though belief in each is still affirmed.  Strang attempted to construct a [[Temple (Latter Day Saints)|temple]] in Voree, but was prevented from completing it due to the poverty and lack of cooperation of his followers.<ref>"[http://www.strangite.org/Temples.htm Temple Locations]". ''Strangite.org''. Retrieved on [[2007-10-28]].</ref>  No "[[Endowment (Latter Day Saints)|endowment]]" rituals comparable to those practiced by the Utah LDS church seem to have existed among the Strangites.<ref name=Women-Marriage>"[http://www.strangite.org/Women.htm Women/Marriage]". ''Strangite.org''. Retrieved on [[2007-10-28]].</ref>  

[[Celestial marriage|Eternal marriage]] formed a part of Strang's teaching, though he did not require it to be performed in a temple (as in the modern LDS church).  Thus, eternal marriages are still contracted in Strang's church even in the absence of any Strangite temple or "endowment" ceremony.  Alcohol, tobacco, coffee and tea were prohibited to his followers, as in many other Mormon denominations. Polygamy is no longer practiced by the Strangites, though belief in its correctness is still affirmed.<ref name=Women-Marriage/>

Strang allowed women to hold the Priesthood offices of [[Priest (Latter Day Saints)|Priest]] and [[Teacher (Latter Day Saints)|Teacher]], unique among all Mormon factions during his lifetime.<ref>Strang 1856, pp. 198-200, 227.</ref>  He welcomed [[African Americans]] into his church, and ordained at least two to the eldership.<ref>"[http://www.strangite.org/African.htm African-Americans]". ''Strangite.org''. Retrieved on [[2007-10-18]].</ref> Strang also mandated [[Conservation movement|conservation]] of land and natural resources, requiring the building of parks and retention of large tracts of woodlands in his kingdom.<ref>Strang 1856, pp. 286-7.</ref>  He defended his claims to prophetic leadership against [[Brigham Young]] and others, wrote an eloquent refutation of the "[[Solomon Spalding]] theory" of the Book of Mormon's authorship,<ref>Strang 1856, pp. 251-68.</ref> and defended the prophetic ministry and teachings of Joseph Smith&ndash;as he understood them.

==Coronation and troubled reign on Beaver Island==
Strang claimed that he was to fulfill the office of [[monarch|king]] as described in the Book of the Law of the Lord.<ref>Strang 1856, pp. 168-80.</ref>  He insisted that this authority was incumbent upon all holders of Joseph Smith's prophetic office from the beginning of time, and his followers believe that [[Council of Fifty|Smith himself was crowned secretly as "king" of the Mormon church]] before his murder.  Strang was crowned in 1850 by his counselor and Prime Minister, an actor named [[George J. Adams]]. About 300 people witnessed his [[coronation]], for which he wore a bright red flannel robe topped by a white collar with black speckles. His tin crown was described in one account as "a shiny metal ring with a cluster of glass stars in the front."<ref name=Weeks/>  Strang also sported a breastplate and carried a wooden scepter.  He "reigned" for six years, and the date of his coronation, [[July 8]], is still mandated as one of the two most important dates in the Strangite church year (the other being [[April 6]], the anniversary of the founding of Joseph Smith's church).<ref>Strang 1856, pg. 293.</ref>

[[Image:Iron-Ore-Bay-Beaver-Island.jpg|thumb|right|A view of Iron Ore Bay on the southern end of [[Beaver Island]].]]

Contrary to popular misconception, Strang never claimed to be the king of Beaver Island itself, nor of any other geographical entity. Rather, he claimed to be king over his church, which he saw as the one, true "[[Kingdom of God]]" prophesied in Scripture and destined to spread over all the earth.<ref>Fitzpatrick, pg. 199.</ref>  However, as his church was the main religious body on Beaver Island, claiming the allegiance of most of its inhabitants, Strang often tended to exert authority even over non-Mormons on Beaver--which would ultimately cause him and his followers a great deal of grief.  Furthermore, he and many of his disciples were accused of forcibly appropriating non-Mormon property on the island, which equally made him few friends among the "gentiles."  

On the other hand, Strang and his people lived in justified apprehension of what their non-Mormon neighbors, many of whom were bullying and threatening toward them, might do next.  Mormons were often beaten up while going to the post office to collect their mail,<ref>Fitzpatrick, pg. 86.</ref> and some of their homes were robbed and even seized by "gentiles" while Mormon men were away.<ref>Fitzpatrick, pg. 96.</ref>  On [[July 4]] [[1850]], a drunken mob of "gentile" fishermen vowed to kill the Mormons or drive them from the island, only to be awed into submission when Strang fired a cannon (which he had secretly acquired) at them.<ref>Strang 1854a, pp. 25-6.</ref>  Competition for business and jobs between Mormons and the non-Mormon inhabitants of Beaver and nearby areas added to tensions on the island, as did the increasing Mormon monopoly on local government, made sure after Beaver and adjacent islands were attached first to [[Emmet County, Michigan|Emmet County]] in 1853, then later organized into their own insular county of [[Manitou County, Michigan|Manitou]] in 1855.  

As a result of his coronation, together with lurid tales spread by George Adams (who had been excommunicated by Strang a few months after the ceremony), Strang was accused of [[treason]], [[counterfeiting]], [[trespass]] on government land, and [[theft]], among other crimes.  He was brought to trial in [[Detroit, Michigan]], after President [[Millard Fillmore]] ordered U.S. District Attorney George Bates to investigate the rumors about Strang and his colony.<ref name=Weeks/> Strang's successful trial defense brought him considerable favorable press, which he leveraged to run for, and win, a seat in the Michigan state legislature as a Democrat in [[1853]].  Facing a determined effort to deny him this seat due to the hostility of his enemies, he was permitted to address the legislature in his defense, after which the [[Michigan House of Representatives]] voted twice (first unanimously, then a second time by a 49-11 margin) to allow "King Strang" to join them.<ref>Fitzpatrick, pg. 101.</ref>  

In the 1853 legislative session, Strang introduced ten bills, five of which passed.<ref>Fitzpatrick, pg. 100.</ref>  The ''Detroit Advertiser'', on [[February 10]] [[1853]], wrote of Strang: "Mr. Strang’s course as a member of the present Legislature, has disarmed much of the prejudices which have previously surrounded him. Whatever may be said or thought of the peculiar sect of which he is the local head, I take pleasure in stating that throughout this session he has conducted himself with the degree of decorum and propriety which have been equaled by his industry, sagacity, good temper, apparent regard for the true interests of the people, and the obligations of his official oath."<ref>([[February 10]] [[1853]]). ''Detroit Advertiser''. Exerpt in "[http://www.mormonbeliefs.com/Strang,_The_Man.htm Mormon Persecution]". ''MormonBeliefs.com''. Retrieved on [[2007-10-28]].</ref>  He was reelected in 1855, and did much to organize the upper portion of Michigan's [[lower peninsula]] into [[County (United States)|counties]] and [[townships]].  Strang ardently fought the illegal practice of trading liquor to local [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes.<ref>Strang 1854a, pp. 15-7</ref><ref>Fitzpatrick, pp. 47-8.</ref>  This made him many enemies among those non-Mormon residents of Beaver and nearby [[Mackinac Island]] who profited mightily from this illicit trade.

==Assassination==
James Strang made foes among his own people, too.  One of these, Thomas Bedford, had been flogged for [[adultery]] on Strang's orders, and felt considerable resentment toward the "king."<ref>Fitzpatrick, pg.110.</ref>  Another, Dr. H.D. McCulloch, had been excommunicated for drunkenness and other alleged misdeeds, after previously enjoying Strang's favor and several high offices in local government.  These conspired against Strang with Alexander Wentworth and Dr. J. Atkyn, who had allegedly endeavored (unsuccessfully) to blackmail the Strangites into paying his numerous bad debts.<ref>Fitzpatrick, pp. 110-1.</ref>  A decree that female Strangites wear [[Bloomers (clothing)|"bloomers"]] only added fuel to the fire for Bedford and other malcontents among Strang's subjects.<ref>([[September 25]] [[2006]]).

''MormonBeliefs.com''. Retrieved on [[2007-10-28]].</ref>

Although Strang apparently knew that Bedford and the others were gunning for him, he seems not to have taken them very seriously.  "We laugh with bitter scorn at all these threats," he wrote in the ''Northern Islander'', just days before his murder.<ref name=Weeks/>  Strang's refusal to employ a [[bodyguard]] or to carry a firearm or other weapon made him an easy target.<ref>([[August 14]] [[1851]]). ''Northern Islander'' as quoted in Fitzpatrick, pg. 97.</ref>      

[[Image:MHGL00190f.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The ''[[USS Michigan]]'' later in its career.]]

On Monday, [[June 16]] [[1856]], Strang was gunned down around 7:00 PM on the dock at the harbor of [[St. James Township, Michigan|St. James]], chief city of Beaver Island, by Wentworth and Bedford, who shot him in the back. All this was carried out in full view of several officers and men of the [[USS Michigan (sidewheel)|USS ''Michigan'']], a [[United States Navy|U.S. Naval]] vessel docked in the harbor. As they watched the assault unfold, not one person on board the ship made any effort to warn or to aid Strang.<ref name=Murderous>(Friday, [[June 20]] [[1856]]). ''Daily Northern Islander''.

Strang was shot three times: one bullet grazed his head, another lodged in his cheek and a third in his spine.  One of the assassins then savagely pistol-whipped the fallen prophet before running aboard the nearby vessel with his companion, where they claimed sanctuary.<ref name=Murderous/>  Some accused Captain McBlair of the "Michigan" of complicity in, or at least foreknowledge of, the assassination plot, though no hard evidence of this was ever forthcoming.<ref>Fitzpatrick, pp. 113, 211.</ref><ref name>"[http://www.mormonbeliefs.com/Strang,%20The%20Martyred%20Prophet.htm#%A0Apostle%20Chidester%20Announces%20James%92%20Death Apostle Chidester Announces James’ Death]". ''MormonBeliefs.com''. Retrieved on [[2007-10-28]].</ref>  The so-called "King of Beaver Island" was taken to Voree, where he lived for three weeks, dying on [[July 9]] [[1856]] at the age of 43.  After refusing to deliver Bedford and Wentworth to the local [[sheriff]],<ref>''Northern Islander'', June 20, 1856.</ref> McBlair transported them to Mackinac Island, where they were subjected to a mock trial, fined $1.25, released, and then feted and praised by the locals.<ref name=Weeks/><ref>([[2002-10-10]]).

Retrieved on [[2007-10-28]].</ref>  Not one of the plotters was ever punished for his crimes.

==After Strang's death==
One day before Strang's death, on what Michigan historian [[Byron M. Cutcheon]] would call "the most disgraceful day in Michigan history,"<ref name=Weeks/> a drunken mob of "gentiles" from Mackinac and elsewhere descended upon Beaver Island and forcibly evicted every Mormon from it.  Strang's subjects on the island&mdash;numbering approximately 2,600 persons<ref name=Weeks/>&mdash;were herded onto hastily-commandeered steamers, most after being robbed of their money and other personal possessions, and unceremoniously dumped onto docks along the shores of Lake Michigan.  A few moved back to Voree, while the rest scattered across the country.

Strang had refused to appoint a successor, telling his apostles to take care of their families as best they could, and await divine instruction.<ref>"[http://www.mormonbeliefs.com/strang,_the_king.htm Kingdom with a Dominion]". ''MormonBeliefs.com''. Retrieved on [[2007-10-28]].</ref>  While his supporters endeavored to keep his church alive, Strang's unique dogma requiring his successor to be ordained by angels<ref>Strang 1856, pp. 163-6.</ref> handicapped his sect in its search for a new prophet.  Lorenzo Dow Hickey, the last of Strang's apostles, would emerge as an ad-hoc leader until his death in 1900, followed by [[Wingfield W. Watson]], a high priest in Strang's organization (until he died in 1922).  Neither of these men claimed Strang's office or authority, however.{{fn|(h)}} Left without a prophet to guide them, most of Strang's members (including all of his wives)<ref>Fitzpatrick, pg. 125.</ref> departed his church in the years after his murder.  Most later joined the [[Community of Christ|Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]], which was established in 1860.  A few, however, continue to this day to carry on Strang's mission and vision as best they can, as they await a new successor to their fallen founder.  

Strang's disciples today are divided into two main factions; one is led by a Presiding [[High Priest (Latter Day Saints)|High Priest]], who does not claim to have the authority or priesthood office possessed by Joseph Smith or James Strang.  The other claims that the first faction is in error, and that by incorporating in 1961, it lost its identity as a faithful continuation of Strang's organization.  This second group claims that ''it'' is the sole true remnant of James Strang's church.{{fn|(i)}} <ref>"[http://www.mormonbeliefs.com/Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter%20Day%20Saints%20(Strangite).htm#The%201961%20Strangite%20Split The 1961 Strangite Split]". ''MormonBeliefs.com''.</ref>  

Missionary work is no longer emphasized among the Strangites (unlike the LDS and many other Mormon sects), as they tend to believe that after three murdered prophets (Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith and James Strang) God closed His [[dispensation]] to the "gentiles" of the West.<ref>"[http://www.mormonbeliefs.com/Mormonism%20Today.htm#time%20of%20the%20Gentiles%20ended Mormonism: time of the Gentiles ended]". ''MormonBeliefs.com''. Retrieved on [[2007-10-28]].</ref> Consequently, Strang's church has continued to dwindle until the present day.  Current membership figures vary between 50 and 300 persons, depending upon the source consulted.<ref>"[http://www.adherents.com/Na/Na_1•91.html 43,941 adherent statistic citations: membership and geography data for 4,300+ religions, churches, tribes, etc.]" ''Adherents.com''.

==Footnotes==
*{{fnb|a}} "Mormonism," as used in this article, refers to the Latter Day Saint movement as a whole, and not just to its largest branch, the LDS church (as is usual among smaller Latter Day Saint sects, many of which dislike this term).  Its use here is only for convenience, not in any derogatory sense.
*{{fnb|b}} David Whitmer and Martin Harris, two of the [[Three Witnesses]], and Hiram Page and John Whitmer of the [[Eight Witnesses]]. 
*{{fnb|c}} John Page and William Smith were apostles at Smith's death; William M'Lellin had previously been an apostle, but was excommunicated in 1838.
*{{fnb|d}} George Miller, who is mentioned in the LDS ''Doctrine & Covenants'' section 124: verses 20, 62 and 70.
*{{fnb|e}} The Strangites use no hyphen in their church title and capitalize the "D" in "Day", just as was done in Joseph Smith's church.
*{{fnb|f}} Strangites still use these terms today, as do members of some other Mormon factions.
*{{fnb|g}} "Young Joseph," as he was called, never accepted this calling and refused to have anything to do with Strang's organization.
*{{fnb|h}} No apostles currently remain in Strang's organization, as all Strangite apostles must be appointed by a Strangite prophet.  The highest current office in Strang's church is that of High Priest (in the "incorporated" faction) or Elder (in the other).
