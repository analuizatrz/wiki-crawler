The '''weapon dance''' employs [[weapon]]s—or stylized versions of weapons—traditionally used in [[combat]] in order to simulate, recall, or reenact combat or the moves of combat in the form of [[dance]], usually for some [[ceremony|ceremonial]] purpose. Such dancing is quite common to folk [[ritual]] in many parts of the world. Weapon dancing is certainly ancient; among the earliest historical references we have are those that refer to the ''pyrhhic'', a weapon dance in ancient [[Sparta]], in which the dance was used as a kind of ritual training for battle.<ref>{{cite journal

There are virtually no parts of the world left where the weapon dance is directly connected with imminent or recent combat. This is especially true of [[Europe]], the nation states of which have long since transcended the [[tribalism]] that gave rise to such folk dances. It is, however, also true of parts of the world where tribal traditions have succumbed only quite recently to [[colonialism]] and the forces of [[Globalization|globalism]]. Thus, the dances that one sees today are part of general movements to preserve and rejuvenate tribal or local traditions—a backlash, if you will, against the levelling forces of globalism. Some of these movements are quite strong now, such as those among native North American tribes and the aboriginal peoples of Australia.

Beyond the scope of this article are the many examples around the world of ritual combat, which, though not dance, has its anthropologically fascinating aspects of purification, getting rid of hostile or dangerous spirits, acting as a surrogate for real battle and even, in ancient times, of being a kind of human sacrifice. Some writers have suggested that even Roman gladiatorial combat was a kind of human sacrifice, a ritual weapon display with the winner often going free.<ref>{{cite journal

Also beyond the scope of this article is the dance of the hunt, of which there are many examples. A very early reference to a weapon dance of the hunt comes in the form of a [[Rock (geology)|rock]] [[engraving]] at [[Çatalhöyük|Çatal Höyük]], the large [[neolithic]] settlement in south-central [[Anatolia]]. It depicts a hunting ritual involving dancers holding their weapons; one figure has a bow in each hand, two perform artistic leaps and another holds a horn-shaped stick and is striking a frame [[drum]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia

==Function of the weapon dance==
In the modern world, dance has come to be regarded as something one does for recreation, thus distancing dance from the important place it has held in many human cultures throughout history—that is, a method of expression, preservation and transmission of the culture and history of a people. Many of the activities that humans have engaged in for millennia—religion and courtship, for example—have traditionally found expression in various kinds of dance. Another activity—combat—has obviously been central to the life of most human cultures; thus, one expects to find dances that celebrate skill in the use of weapons. Indeed, there is a wide range of such weapon dances in the world; they vary from general displays of prowess in the use of weapons to reenactments of real episodes of combat specific to a given culture.

==Examples==
===Europe===
{{seealso|Scottish highland dance|sword dance}}
Sword dancing exists in some parts of Europe. The weapon may be used to act out mock combat during the dance, or may be incorporated as an element of the dance itself, intertwining with other swords. In some places, sticks are used instead of swords. Iberian stick dances (paulitos, paloteos, [[ball de bastons]]) display two opposite rows of dancers.  A common sword dance in Europe is the ''moresca'' in Spain, in which the dance recalls the strife between Christians and Muslims in that country from the 12th-15th century.<ref name="Wolfram">{{cite journal

In [[Macedonia]] and Northern Italy, weapon dances may be used to exorcise evil spirits before a wedding. Sabre dancing exists in the Balkans; the most famous of these is from [[Albania]], where two male rivals simulate a duel over a woman. Northern-Portuguese ''jogo do pau'' involves two rivals with long sticks.  Other weapons, such as axes (or wooden versions thereof) may be used in some places. In parts of Europe, there are lance dances, dagger dances, and even rifle dances.<ref name="Wolfram"/>

In the [[Scottish Highlands]], there are dances that used the [[Lochaber axe]], the [[broadsword]], [[targe]] & dirk and the flail. The Highland [[Dirk]] Dance, resembles a combative dance similar to those of Indonesian Penjak Silat, which has the performer executing knife techniques combined with wrestling style kicks, trips and sweeps.<ref name="Wolfram"/>

[[Image:Grenoside1.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Boxing Day 2005 - The Grenoside Sword Dance Captain holds aloft the sword lock before placing it around his neck]]
Hilt-and-point sword dances exist in many places in Europe. In this kind of dance the swords interlock to form a “rose,” or “lock,” that is placed around the neck of a participant to simulate decapitation. As well, crossed-sword dances are common in Europe. Typically, dancers execute complicated patterns of steps over and between the swords. In some variations, clay pipes may replace the swords. Many European sword dances were appropriated by trade guilds, with tools replacing the swords. In Turkey and Greece there exists a butchers’ dance called the ''hassapikos''. It is now a social dance, but goes back to a battle mime in the Middle Ages performed with swords and performed by members of by the butchers' guild.  Also in Turkey are the so-called “guerrilla dances”, performed by dances arranged in a circle who make swishing and whiffling sounds with their swords (possibly to clear the area of evil spirits), followed by mock combat.  

Chain-sword dance is a group dance in which the dancers first use a sword or other implement (stick, stave, etc.) to link themselves in a chain. In the Hungarian tradition, the ''Erdőbénye'' cooper dance represents this form of dance. A dance similar to the ''moresca'' exists on the island of [[Korčula]], recalling combat between Christians and Muslims. Historically, the Hungarin ''heyduck'' dance was a soldiers' dance that involved vituoso whirling of weapons and free-form compositions with battle practice motifs. Such dances also appear in [[Gypsy]], [[Slovaks|Slovak]], [[Ruthenian]], and [[Transylvanian]] folklore. In many of these areas, the so-called "stick dancing" of shepherds is a reenactment of combat with real weapons.<ref>{{cite journal

In the [[Basque]] province of [[Gipuzkoa]] in Spain, the ''Okravario Dantza'' is performed—a sword dance in which a participant dances atop a grid of crossed swords held aloft. In [[Tolosa]], on Midsummer Day, the ''Bordon-Dantza'' is performed; some point its origins to the border fights in the Middle Ages, when the Castillian troops from Gipuzkoa won an important victory over the troops from [[Navarre]] at the Battle of [[Beotibar]]. Sticks simulate some weapons, and [[halberd]]s--a combination of a spear and a battle-axe--are also used.<ref>{{cite web

Some traditional [[Cossack]] dancing employs swords and whips and, thus, qualifies as weapons dancing.

===Asia===
''Baris'' is a traditional dance of [[Bali]], in which a solo dancer depicts the feelings of a young warrior prior to battle. Originally, Baris was performed as a religious ritual.  The dancer may bear a [[kris]], a spear, a bow, or other weapons, depending on the variant performed.  The word "Baris" literally means "line" or "file", and referred to the line of soldiers who served the [[raja]]s of Bali. The dance is usually performed by men in a group with as few as four dancers and as many as
sixty. The ritualistic functon of the dance is to show physical maturity by demonstrating military skills, particularly the use of weapons.<ref>{{cite journal

The development of art dance, in general, in [[China]] reached its peak during the [[Tang dynasty]] and then was largely integrated into Chinese Opera practice.

The [[Dayak]] people of [[Borneo]] are renowned for their solo sword dances, which show the skill of a young man using a sharp ''[[manda]]''. Also on the island of Borneo one finds the [[Lotud]], an [[Indigenous peoples of Oceania|indigenous]] [[ethnic group]] residing in [[Sabah]]. The Lotud are well known for their very colourful costumes and their dances, one of which is the ''Bakanjar'', a war-like dance with a man holding a sword and a shield, originally performed to portray the sword fight and heoric exploits of the headhunting days.

Among the traditional weapon dances of [[India]] is the ''Shad Sukmynsiem'', performed in the north-eastern state of [[Meghalaya]]. Both Christians and Hindus may take part as long as they belong to Khasi community. Young lads clad in colourful silk dhotis dance around with a sword or spear in one hand and a plume in the other.

The ''Jerusema'' (or ''Mbenede'') dance of the Zezuru people in [[Zimbabwe]] is an interesting kind of hybrid war dance--"hybrid" in the sense that music and dance formed a part of the actual battle-field preparations, themselves, as well as of the ritual dance recalling the battle. <ref>{{cite journal

The dance is a re-creation of a battle strategy developed by the Zezuru in the 19th century against incursions of other tribes in the wake of colonialist expansion of the [[Boers]]. The dance, itself, recalls the music and dance used as a diversionary tactic on the battlefield to distract the enemy while Zezuru warriors maneuvered into position; thus, the ritual dance involves the music and dance of the “distractors” as well as warriors with weapon moving into position.

[[Ethiopia]] has a long, historical reputation as a place where the weapon dance plays an important cultural role. According to [[Lucian]], a Greek writer from the second century, “The Ethiopians dance also during the battle. The Ethiopian never shoots his arrow without dancing and making a menacing gesture beforehand. He wants to frighten the enemy by his dance beforehand.” The broad range of weapon dances includes the ''hota'' jumping dance of [[Amharic]] males; the attack dance of the Hailefo; the stick-dance of the Kullo; the ''Beroronsi Hama Haban'', a dramatic dagger dance of the Esa; and the ''shire'', the saber dance of the [[Tigray-Tigrinya people|Tigrean]] nomadic shepherds.<ref name=" Martin">{{cite journal

The [[Nifo oti]] or Samoan fire knife dance is also a kind of weapon dance.

The ''kailao'' is a standing male war dance of [[Tonga]]. The ''kailao'' is performed by men (less commonly women also perform it with the men as a mixed dance), who carry clubs or fighting sticks. The performers dance in a fierce manner to emulate combat, all to the accompaniment of a slit drum or a tin box. Additional idiophonic percussion is provided by strung rattles worn on the anklets of the dancers, and the clashing together of the wooden implements of war, which today are either sticks or mock weapons. The dance is unusual for Tonga in that it lacks recited poetry as accompaniment, which fact is taken to mean that it was imported to Tonga from elsewhere.<ref>{{cite book

In the [[Jamiltepec]] region of [[Mexico]], there exists perhaps the most colorful version of that kind of dance, the Chareos dance. It represents a battle between [[Moors]], led by Pilates, and Christians, led by James, the apostle. Sixteen male dancers take part and the dancer who plays the part of James appears as a horse rider and wears a costume that incorporates a white horse. The dancers wear ostrich feathers on their heads, a peacock feather at the front, white cotton square over their shoulders, velvet trousers decorated with gold brocade over white cotton pants and carry a machete. In addition, the leader has a hat with a small mirror and a white feather headdress. Two men at the front carry two red flags and two white flags, red symbolizing the blood spilt by James' soldiers and white symbolizing the peace that reigned after the Christian victory. The sounds of drums and flutes accompany the dance. These dances that pit Christian against Moor are almost certainly Christianized versions of earlier, pre-[[Cortez]] dances that ritualized the battle between the tiger and the eagle.<ref>{{cite web

The participants played during festivals and holidays, jumping and leaping in front of musical bands, military troops, and religious processions.
