'''Tenacious D''' is an [[United States|American]] [[satirical]] [[rock music|rock]] duo formed by  musicians and actors [[Kyle Gass]] and [[Jack Black]] in [[Los Angeles, California]] in 1994. Their music fuses vulgar absurdist comedy with [[rock music]] in a style that critics have described as "mock rock".<ref name='AMG'>{{cite news | first=Heather | last=Phares | coauthors= | title=AMG Biography | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:gjfqxqyjldte~T1 | work =[[Allmusic]] | pages = | accessdate = 2008-03-25 | language = }}</ref><ref name="The New Zealand Herald">{{cite news | first=Cathrin | last=Schaer  | title=Tenacious D: Mock’n’rollers | work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/6/story.cfm?c_id=6&objectid=9002730 | date=[[2004-12-12]] | accessdate=2007-01-11}}</ref>

Tenacious D's music showcases Black's theatrical vocals and Gass' acoustic guitar playing abilities. Many of their songs discuss the duo's purported musical and sexual prowess, as well as their friendship and intake  of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]. Their self-titled album features absurd and humorous sketches. Music critics have compared the storyteller-style lyrics of their songs to lyrics of [[rock opera]].<ref name='The Seattle Times'>{{cite news | first=Ted | last=Fry |  title=Sympathy for the devil: Rockers seek Satan's pick | date=[[2006-11-22]] |  url =http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/movies/2003441928_tenacious22.html | work =[[The Seattle Times]] |  accessdate = 2007-03-15 | language = }}</ref><ref name='Entertainment Weekly'>{{cite news | first=Owen | last=Gleiberman |  title=Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny (2006) | date=[[2006-11-21]] |  url =http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1562105,00.html | work =Entertainment Weekly |  accessdate = 2007-03-15 | language = }}</ref> 

The band first gained popularity in 1999 when they starred in the self-titled ''[[Tenacious D (TV series)|Tenacious D]]'', a [[television series]] on [[HBO]], in which Black and Gass attempted to establish themselves as the "Greatest Band on Earth".<ref name="AMG" /> The series airs occasionally on [[Comedy Central]] and is available on their DVD, ''[[The Complete Masterworks]]''. In addition, they have since recorded two albums, and starred in their own movie, ''[[Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny]]''.

==Appearances==
===Film and television===
Black and Gass first appeared performing together in ''[[Bio-Dome]]'' (1996), followed by ''[[The Cable Guy]]'' (1996), ''[[Cradle Will Rock]]'' (1999), ''[[Saving Silverman]]'' (2001) and ''[[Shallow Hal]]'' (2001), although in none of these appearances were they performing as Tenacious D. ''[[Bongwater (film)|Bongwater]]'' (1997) featured Black, as his character Devlin, performing "[[Jesus Ranch]]", which was featured in an episode of their TV series. Black has starred in a number of films himself including ''[[High Fidelity (movie)|High Fidelity]]'', ''[[School of Rock]]'' and ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]''. In 2006, Tenacious D starred in their own movie, ''Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny'', in which they set out to become the greatest rock band in the world, by means of a [[guitar pick]] with magical powers.

Black and Gass have made several television appearances performing songs from their first album. In [[June 16]], [[2001]], Tenacious D were featured as puppets performing "Friendship" on an episode of ''[[Crank Yankers]]''. In [[April 27]], [[2002]] they guest starred on ''[[MADtv]]'' playing the song "Tribute" with [[Foo Fighters]] vocalist [[Dave Grohl]] on drums. Later, Tenacious D made an appearance in the first episode of ''[[Tom Goes to the Mayor]]'' to be televised on [[Adult Swim]].  In the episode, they were known as "The Bear Trap Brothers," two competitive brothers who ran bear trap shops that were located side-by-side. The band appeared in musical promotional clips on MTV during the week before the premiere of ''[[The Osbournes]]''. The two musical shorts featured Black and Gass dressed in stereotypical rock outfits. These appearances were featured on ''[[Tenacious D - The Complete Masterworks|The Complete Masterworks]]'' as an [[Easter egg (virtual)|easter egg]].

In the run up to the release of ''The Pick of Destiny'' film, Tenacious D made several appearances performing the "[[POD (song)|Pick of Destiny]]" song, including at the [[American Music Awards of 2006|2006 American Music Awards]] on [[11 November]], [[2006]] and on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]''. On [[2 December]], [[2006]], Tenacious D was the musical guest on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' for the first time.<ref name='SNL Transcripts'>{{cite web |title=SNL Transcripts: Matthew Fox |date=2006-12-02 |work=Saturday Night Live Transcripts |url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/06/06g.phtml |pages=Season 32: Episode 7 |accessdate=2007-08-18}}</ref> They opened the 2006 [[Spike TV]] Video Game Awards, with a performance of "The Metal".<ref name="gamespot-tenacious-d">{{cite news | author=Tim Surette | title=Oblivion nabs Spike TV top honors | work=[[GameSpot]] | url=http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6162929.html?sid=6162929 | date=2007-12-09 | accessdate=2007-01-17}}</ref> They also made an appearance on the [[2006 MTV Video Music Awards]].<ref name='popmatters.com'>{{cite news | first=Evan | last=Sawdey | coauthors= | title=The MTV Video Music Awards 2006 | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.popmatters.com/pm/tv/reviews/5125/the-mtv-video-music-awards-2006/ | work =popmatters.com | pages = | accessdate = 2008-03-23 | language = }}</ref>

The song "The Metal" from [[The Pick of Destiny]] is featured in the video game [[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]], in the sixth set titled "The Hottest Band On Earth," likely a reference to Tenacious D's running joke of being the greatest band in the world.<ref name='Cnet'>{{cite news | first=Tim | last=Moynihan | coauthors= | title='Guitar Hero III' setlist takes shape | date=[[2007-05-23]] | publisher= | url =http://www.news.com/8301-10784_3-9722230-7.html | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-02-27 | language = }}</ref>

=== Tours ===
[[Image:Saxaboom.jpg|thumb|Tenacious D 'playing' the [[Sax-a-boom]] live.]]
In 2001, Tenacious D started their second nationwide [[Concert|concert tour]], performing at larger venues, any of which sold out.<ref name="AMG" /> Until 2006, Tenacious D usually performed only with acoustic guitars, rarely with a full band. Tenacious D has also staged two international concert tours as well as numerous domestic tours,<ref name="tenacious-d-tours">{{cite web|url=http://tenaciousd.com/tour.html|title=Tenacious D's tours|accessdate=January 13|accessyear=2007}}</ref> though they have rarely played in non-English speaking countries. Black says this is because foreign concerts are "a little funky" because "the subtleties do get lost in translation".<ref name="Relix" /> In addition, he comments on the angst they experience before concerts saying: "We're always looking for a loophole. Pretty much every concert we've ever done, we're trying to find a way to cancel the show at the last minute."<br />Tenacious D have been confirmed to play Leeds and Reading festivals in the UK in August 2008. This is their first live show for above a year.<ref name="Relix" />
