'''Allegheny County''' is a [[county]] located in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Pennsylvania]].  As of 2000, the population was 1,281,666.  The [[county seat]] is [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]].  The county forms the nucleus of the [[Pittsburgh Metro Area|Pittsburgh Metropolitan Statistical Area]], [[Pittsburgh DMA]] and [[Pittsburgh Tri-State]].

== History ==
Before it was settled by Europeans, the county was mostly wilderness and uninhabited except for wandering Indians such as the [[Iroquois]], who were the largest tribe in the area.  The Allegheny River, Mountains, and County get their name from the [[Allegwi,Alleghans]] indians believed to have inhabited the region before the 13th centuary.

The first [[European]]s to enter the area were the [[France|French]] in [[1749]].  Captain [[Pierre Joseph de Celeron, sieur de Blainville]] claimed the Ohio Valley and all of Western Pennsylvania for [[Louis XV of France]].  The captain travelled along the Ohio and Allegheny Rivers inserting lead plates in the ground to mark the land for [[France]].

Since most of the towns in that time were developed along waterways, both the French and the British desired control over the rivers in the area.  So the British sent Major [[George Washington]] to try to compel the French to leave their posts, with no success.  Having failed in his mission he returned, crossing the ice-filled Allegheny River where he almost drowned.  In [[1754]] the English tried again to enter the area.  This time, they sent 41 Virginians to build [[Fort Prince George]].  The French got news of the fort and sent an army to take over the fort.  The French resumed building on the incomplete fort and fortified it.  They renamed the fort to [[Fort Duquesne]].

The loss of the fort cost the English dearly because [[Fort Duquesne]] became one of the focal points of the [[French and Indian War]].  The first attempt to retake the fort, by General [[Edward Braddock]], failed miserably.  It was not until General [[John Forbes (General)|John Forbes]] attacked in [[1758]], four years after they had lost the fort, that they recaptured and destroyed the fort.  They built a new fort with a moat and named it [[Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)|Fort Pitt]].

Both Pennsylvania and [[Virginia]] claimed the region that is now Allegheny County.  Pennsylvania administered most of the region as part [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland County]].  Virginia considered everything south of the [[Ohio River]] and east of the [[Allegheny River]] to be part of its [[Yohogania County]] and governed it from [[Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)|Fort Dunmore]].  The overlapping boundaries, dual governments, and multiple deed claims soon proved unworkable.  In [[1780]], the two states agreed to extend the [[Mason-Dixon line]] westward and the region became part of Pennsylvania.  From [[1781]] until [[1788]], much of what had been claimed as part of Yohogania County, Virginia was administered as a part of the newly created [[Washington County, Pennsylvania]]. 

Allegheny County was officially created on [[September 24]],  [[1788]] from parts of [[Washington County, Pennsylvania|Washington]] and [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland]] Counties.  It was formed due to pressure from settlers living in the area around [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], which became the [[county seat]] in [[1791]].  The county originally extended all the way to the shores of [[Lake Erie]] and became the "mother county" for most of what is now northwestern Pennsylvania. By [[1800]], the county's current borders were set.  

In the 1790s, a [[whiskey]] excise tax was imposed by the [[Federal government of the United States|United States Federal Government]].  This started the so-called [[Whiskey Rebellion]] when the farmers who depended on whiskey income refused to pay and drove off a local town's marshal.  After many demonstrations by farmers, President [[George Washington]] arrived with troops to stop the rebellion.

The area developed rapidly throughout the [[19th century|19th]] to become the center of steel production in the nation. [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] would later be labelled as the "Steel Capital of the World."

== Law and government ==
For most of the [[20th century]] until [[1999]], the county was governed exclusively under the state's Second Class County Code.  Under this code, the county handled everything: elections, prisons, airports, public health and city planning.  Unlike the rest of the state where certain public offices are combined and held by one person, in Allegheny County all public offices are held by elected individuals.

Before [[January 1]], [[2000]], there were 3 county [[commissioner]]s.  These were replaced with an elected chief officer (the county executive), a county council with 15 members (13 elected by district, 2 elected county-wide), and an appointed county manager.  The changes were intended to maintain a separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches while providing the citizens with greater control over the government.

The county has 130 municipalities with their own governmental setup; no other county in Pennsylvania has nearly as many, with Luzerne County's 76 being the second most.<ref>[http://www.pamunicipalitiesinfo.com Pennsylvania Municipalities Information]</ref>  The county has one [[Second Class City]] ([[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]) and 3 [[Third Class City|Third Class Cities]] ([[Clairton, Pennsylvania|Clairton]], [[Duquesne, Pennsylvania|Duquesne]], and [[McKeesport, Pennsylvania|McKeesport]]).

A 2004 study by the [[University of Pittsburgh]] stated that Allegheny County would be better served by consolidating the southeastern portion of the county (which includes many small, poor communities) into one large municipality, called "Rivers City", which would have a combined population of approximately 250,000.

==Geography==
Allegheny County is known for the three rivers that flow through the county and meet in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]: the [[Allegheny River|Allegheny]], [[Monongahela River|Monongahela]], and [[Ohio River|Ohio]] rivers. An additional river, the [[Youghiogheny River|Youghiogheny]], meets the Monongahela at [[McKeesport, Pennsylvania|McKeesport]]. The land is covered with large amounts of forests.

According to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of 1,929 [[square kilometer|km²]] (745 [[square mile|mi²]]).  1,891 km² (730 mi²) of it is land and 38 km² (15 mi²) of it (1.95%) is water.

==Demographics==
As of the [[census]][[Geographic references#2|²]] of 2000, there were 1,281,666 people, 537,150 households, and 332,495 families residing in the county.  The [[population density]] was 678/km² (1,755/mi²).  There were 583,646 housing units at an average density of 309/km² (799/mi²).  The racial makeup of the county was 84.33% [[Race (United States Census)|White]], 12.41% [[Race (United States Census)|Black]] or [[Race (United States Census)|African American]], 0.12% [[Race (United States Census)|Native American]], 1.69% [[Race (United States Census)|Asian]], 0.03% [[Race (United States Census)|Pacific Islander]], 0.34% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 1.07% from two or more races.  0.87% of the population were [[Hispanic American|Hispanic]] or [[Race (United States Census)|Latino]] of any race.

There were 537,150 households out of which 26.40% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 46.10% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 12.40% had a female householder with no husband present, and 38.10% were non-families. 32.70% of all households were made up of individuals and 13.20% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.  The average household size was 2.31 and the average family size was 2.96.

In the county, the population was spread out with 21.90% under the age of 18, 8.50% from 18 to 24, 28.30% from 25 to 44, 23.40% from 45 to 64, and 17.80% who were 65 years of age or older.  The median age was 40 years. For every 100 females there were 90.00 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 86.20 males.

== Economy ==
In the late [[1700s]] farming played a critical role in the growth of the area.  There was a surplus of grain due to transportation difficulties in linking with the eastern portion of the state.  As a result, the farmers distilled the grain into [[whiskey]], which significantly helped the farmers financially.  

The area quickly became one of the key manufacturing areas in the young country. [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] quickly became the largest inland port in the nation, which it remains today.  Coupled with deposits of iron and coal and the easy access to waterways, the city quickly became one of the most important steel producing areas in the world.

With the decline of the steel industry, the area shifted to other industries.  Today the area is known for its hospitals, universities, and industrial centers.  Despite the decline of heavy industry, the city is the home to a number of large companies such as the [[H. J. Heinz Company|H J Heinz Corporation]].
