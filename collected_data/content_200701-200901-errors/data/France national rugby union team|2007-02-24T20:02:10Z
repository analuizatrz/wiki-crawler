The '''France national rugby union team''' are a national sporting side, representing [[France]] in [[rugby union]]. The team is also known as les Bleus or les Tricolores. France is governed by the [[Fédération Française de Rugby]], which was formed in 1919. France competes in the [[Six Nations Championship]] annually. The team was infamously expelled from the competition in the 1930s because of professionalism and other problems. France has won the competition outright on 14 occasions, shared in another 8 wins and completed 8 Grand Slams.

Since the [[1987 Rugby Union World Cup|inaugural World Cup]] in 1987, France have competed in all tournaments which have taken place. France appeared in the very first World Cup final, but lost to [[All Blacks|New Zealand]]. They were again losing finalists in the [[1999 Rugby Union World Cup|1999 World Cup]] against [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]]. [[2003 Rugby World Cup|The last World Cup]] saw France finish atop of their group table and make it to the semi-finals.

==History==
===Early years===
Rugby was introduced to the Le Havre region of [[France]] by English merchants in 1872 and spread through the country with them, but despite this arrival in the north of the country the game began to flourish in the poorer, more rural south amongst workers in the wine trade. The first involvement a national rugby union side had was at the [[1900 Summer Olympics|1900 Paris Olympics]], where a French team took part in the rugby union event. France beat Britain (represented by Mosley Wanderers RFC) 27 - 8 and Germany 27-17 to win the gold medal. In 1906 France played and lost their first ever [[Test match|Test]] match against [[Dave Gallaher]]'s [[All Blacks]], losing 38-8 in Paris. France first played [[England national rugby union team|England]] in March 1906, again in France, this time losing 35-8. In ''The Complete Rugby Footballer'', Gallaher and [[Billy Stead]] wrote of French rugby; "We are strongly of the opinion that the game will spread in their country and that in the course of time they will put a team in the field which will command the utmost respect of any other."

France played their first test outside their nation on the 1st of January 1907, losing to [[England national rugby union team|England]] 31-13 at the [[Athletic Ground]] in [[Richmond, England|Richmond]]. Two days later they played a game against the Springboks in [[Parc des Princes]], Paris with a side made up from the two Parisian clubs: Stade Français and Racing Club de France. Only two of the side that had faced the All Blacks played against the Springboks - three-quarter Paul Sagot and forward Georges Jérôme. and none was in the team that had played England. The Springboks scored 13 tries in winning 55-6.

===The Five Nations and the Olympics===
France played fellow European rugby union nations, [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] and [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]] for the first time in 1908 and 1909 respectively. When [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] played France in the first official international match between the two countries in 1910, the foundation was laid for a [[Six Nations Championship|Five Nations competition]]. Their first win in the competition came against Scotland 16-15 in Paris in 1911. In early 1913, France was host to a touring [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springboks]] party, France lost 5 points to 35, the match was part of an era that last from 1911 until 1920 which saw France lose 18 games in a row.

In 1919, the [[Fédération Française de Rugby]] was formed, 13 years after France's test debut. At the [[1920 Summer Olympics|1920 Antwerp Olympics]] there was another rugby union event and France was one of only two teams to enter. A straight final took place between the USA and France but the USA caused a shock by winning 8-0 to take the gold medal. Their first win in the five nations against Ireland was attained in 1920 in Dublin 15-7. During their last match of the 1921 Five Nations, France showed signs of new strength beating [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]] 20 to 10. Though France did not win a game the following year, the side did draw with Scotland and England.

In 1924 rugby union was again an event at the [[1924 Summer Olympics|Olympics held in Paris]], France. France beat Romania 59-3, scoring 13 tries including four by the fine Stade Francais winger Adolphe Jaureguy. The final took place at Colombes stadium, Paris on 18 May 1924 and the USA took the gold with a 17-3 victory in front of 30,000 spectators. The [[All Blacks]] returned to France in 1926, the first time since their inaugural test against them in 1906, France lost 6 to 30.

===Expelled from Five Nations===
The mid to late 1920s was a period of disappointment for the French, that is until they won their first games over England and Wales, in 1927 and 1928 respectively. France had mediocre results on field during the latter end of the decade and the start of the 1930s, but showed definite signs of improvements in the Five Nations. However, they were expelled from the Five Nations in 1932 following accusations of professionalism in the French league as well as on-field violence and poor organisation and were not allowed to rejoin until 1939. During this time many French players turned to [[rugby league]], which began to build in popularity, as the latter code was excluded from the Five Nations. Despite this there were some internationals played; [[Germany national rugby union team|Germany]] between 1932 and 1936, [[Italy national rugby union team|Italy]] (1937) and [[Romania national rugby union team|Romania]] (1938). On the 2nd of January 1934 [[FIRA - Association of European Rugby|FIRA]] was formed, an organisation to rival the [[International Rugby Board]].

Having been expelled from the Five Nations and forced to play against weaker opposition, France went on a winning spree which still stands today, winning ten games in a row during the years from 1931 to 1936. During the [[Germany|German]] occupation of France in [[World War II]], [[Vichy France]] forcibly merged the French [[rugby league]] into the French [[rugby union]], declaring that there was only one rugby.

===Post war===
The Five nations resumed after the second World War in 1947 and French rugby came of age. [[Lucien Mias]] was the innovative captain whose [[line-out]] ploys bring a new attacking dimension to forward play. They finally won their first outright Five Nations title in 1959. They were champions for four years in a row and in 1968 won their first [[Grand_Slam_%28Rugby_Union%29|Grand Slam]]. In 1952 France played their second match against the Springboks and again lost 25-3. France's recorded their first win over New Zealand 3-0 at Colombes in 1954.

The French made their first visit to South Africa in 1958 and rocked the Springboks by winning the two-test series. Led by Lucien Mias, in the absence of tour skipper Michel Celaya who had been injured, the underestimated French drew the first test 3-3 at Newlands and then produced an even bigger shock by beating the Springboks 9-5 at altitude at Ellis Park. That tour was considered a watershed in the history of French rugby union; signaling that they were now among the top nations.

===1960s-1980s===
The Springboks formidable 1960/61 touring side were held to a 0-0 draw at Colombes Stadium in Paris. In 1964 the Tricolores returned to South Africa for a single match in Springs, and beat the Boks again 8-6 in a test described until his dying day by Dr Danie Craven as the worst yet to be seen in South Africa. In 1967 The French again toured South Africa. They were beaten 26-3 in Durban and 16-3 in the "Battle of Bloemfontein" but were able to come back and win the third 19-14 in Johannesburg and draw the last 6-6 in Cape Town.

The late 1960s and early 1970s was also a golden era in the Five Nations, with the French running the [[Wales national rugby union team|Welsh]] every step of the way, winning  in 1967 and 1968 and sharing the top spot in 1970 and 1973. Titanic battles raged between [[Barry John]], [[Gareth Edwards]], Dai Morris, John Taylor and Gerald Davies for the Welsh and Jo Maso, Claude Dourthe, Jean-Pierre Lux, Guy Camberabero and Pierre Villepreux for the French.

[[Jean Desclaux]] coached France between 1973 and 1980. The 1976 Championship went well for France, their only loss came against [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] and they beat [[England national rugby union team|England]] 30-9. 1977 saw France win their second Grand Slam. In 1978 France finally became a full member of the International Rugby Board. France beat the All Blacks in New Zealand for the first time 24-19 on Bastille day 14 July, 1979.

In November 1980 France play their last international against South Africa in the apartheid era. They were led by Jean-Pierre Rives and lost 15-37 to the Springboks in what was termed the "Summer Test". [[Jacques Fouroux]] became the coach of France shortly before the 1981 Five Nations tournament. In the ten years that he managed the side, France won the Five Nations on six occasions and two Grand Slams (1981 and 1987). France's successes were based around their massive pack, a fact which upset a number of commentators in France who preferred a more technical approach. Famous names from this time included [[Philippe Sella]], [[Daniel Dubroca]] and [[Serge Blanco]].

===Early World Cups===
France entered the [[1987 Rugby World Cup|inaugural World Cup]] as one of the favourites. France beat [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]] 30-24 in the semi final, coming from behind three times to triumph. France were unable to repeat the feat in the final against favourites [[All Blacks|New Zealand]] losing 29-9. After an embarrassing 12-6 defeat to [[Romania national rugby union team|Romania]] on French soil, Fouroux was given the sack.

With the ban on playing South Africa lifted, France toured South Africa. They were led by Olivier Roumat after tour captain Jean-Francois Tordo had suffered a horrific facial wound in the game against Western Province at Newlands. They lost to South Africa 'B' and Northern Transvaal and drew with Free State but then drew the first test 20-20 in Durban and again upset the odds by taking the series with an 18-17 victory at Ellis Park. Knocked out by England in the quarter-finals in the [[1991 Rugby World Cup]], they were desperately unlucky to lose in the semi-finals to the hosts and eventual champions [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]] in [[1995 Rugby World Cup|1995]].

===Modern era===
As the game adjusted to the new professional era, the Championship was very much dominated by England, who coming off the 1995 win, bascked up with a tournament win in 1996. During the tournament, France actually defeated England, but it was their one point loss to Wales that prevented them from taking the title. After the Five Nations France hosted Romania, and later travelled to Argentina for a two match series; winning all fixtures. At the end of the year, they met Wales, who had beaten them in their last game of the Five Nations, though this time France won, 40 to 33, though this was followed by two losses to the Springboks at home.

After narrowly missing out on the 1996 Five Nations championship, France entered the tournament with confidence, and went through the competition undefeated. After the win, France played aspiring Five Nations entrants Italy, who defeated France 40 points to 32. After defeating Romania, France continued on to Australia for a two test series, which they lost. At the end of the year, France defeated Italy, Romania and Argentina at home, and against host South Africa for a two test series, losing both, the second by 40 points.

Despite performing poorly against the southern hemisphere teams of Australia and South Africa in 1997, France successfully defended their Five Nations title, and again completed a grand slam of the tournament, even defeating Wales 51 to nil. France also hosted Australia at the end of the year, though the Wallabies won, 32 to 21.

Their Five Nations title defense was off to a weak start, after defeating Ireland by just one point. France went onto lose every other match and finished [[Wooden spoon (award)|wooden-spoonists]] in the last ever Five Nations. After mixed results during the mid-year, France stormed through the group stages at the [[1999 Rugby World Cup|1999 World Cup]] to finish atop of their pool. After defeating Argentina 47 to 26  in the quarter-finals, France proceeded to the semi-finals, where they met red hot favourites, the All Blacks. Against the odds, France defeated the All Blacks 43 to 31 with an outstanding display of attacking rugby, which saw them enter the final, where they would meet Australia. Fatigue took hold as they were beaten convincingly 35 to 12 by Australia at Cardiff's new [[Millennium Stadium]].

[[Bernard Laporte]] became the first fully professional head coach at the end of 1999. In 2000, Italy joined the Five Nations, making the tournament the Six Nations. France did not perform to expectations in the revamped tournament, losing to both England and Ireland and finishing second behind England. After defeating Romania 67 to 20, France hosted Australia in Paris, who beat them 18 to 13 in a 1999 World Cup final re-match. This was followed by a two test series against the All Blacks, which France lost one and won one.

France again did not perform that well in the 2001 Six Nations, losing to Ireland, Wales and England; and only finishing fifth. They did however manage victories over South Africa and Australia at the end of the year, as well as an impressive 77 to 10 win over Fiji. France went undefeated in the [[2002 Six Nations Championship]] to claim the first Six Nations grand slam. Though they later lost two games to Australia, France defeated South Africa, and drew with the All Blacks that year.

France lost two matches at the [[2003 Six Nations Championship|2003 Six Nations]], including their opening game with England, who would go onto win a grand slam. France finished only third. In preparation for the [[2003 Rugby World Cup|2003 World Cup]], France played Argentina, the All Blacks and England, with mixed results. France won their opening match against Fiji at [[Brisbane]]'s [[Suncorp Stadium]], which saw them continue undefeated through the rest of the pool stages. They met Ireland at [[Telstra Dome]] in [[Melbourne]] in the quarter finals, which they won 43 points to 21. France then met England at [[Telstra Stadium]] in [[Sydney]], and went down seven to 24. At the same venue, France contested for third place with the All Blacks, and lost, finishing fourth overall in the tournament.
 
After the strong showing at the World Cup, France reproduced their Six Nations success of 2002 at the [[2004 Six Nations Championship]]. France won all five of their matches to win the tournament and complete a grandslam. France finished second, behind Wales in the [[2005 Six Nations Championship]], and the following year at the [[2006 Six Nations Championship|2006 tournament]], France won again, getting their third Six Nations trophy under Laporte.

The following year France completed a tournament grand slam of the [[2004 Six Nations Championship|2004 Six Nations]], inlcuding a win over World Champions England. After a short successful tour of North America, France played southern hemisphere teams, Australia, Argentina and the All Blacks; losing all three. In 2005 France completed another strong Six Nations, losing only to eventual grand slam winners Wales. France lost a two test series to South Africa, and lost  to Australia during the mid-year. At the end of the year, France continued Australia's run of losses, and completed heavy wins over Canada and Tonga, and a close victory over South Africa. France lost their opening game of the [[2006 Six Nations Championship|2006 Six Nations]], 16 to 20 to Scotland, but went on to defeat the other four nations to win the Six Nations.

[[Image:Logo XV de france.JPG|250px|thumb|Uniform of the French team]]
Until 1912, the uniform of the French team was not blue and did not have a rooster on it, but was white with two rings, one red and one blue. The rings were chosen by France  as its symbol for the Olympic games, there were only two rings because only two continents, America and Europe, participated in the Olympic games at that time<ref>[http://www.sncf.com/actu/rugby/LSDT-premier-maillot-Equipe-France.html First uniform of the French rugby team]</ref>.

After the first game won by France, against Scotland in 1911, [[Marcel Communeau]] who was then captain of the French team, asked that the team adopt the ''coq'' (rooster) as its symbol<ref>[http://rugby-nomades.qc.ca/info-nomades/histoire_1911.php January 2nd 1911 : Birth of a Nation]</ref>; the rooster was probably chosen because it is considered as a proud and combative animal, that can be sometimes aggressive. The rooster was used previously as a symbol by a French team, a former soccer player, [[Jean Rigal]], wore a uniform with this emblem as early as May 1910<ref>[http://crdp.ac-bordeaux.fr/rugby/arts/5-01-02.pdf Le coq dans le sport]</ref>. 

The badge was initially white and red, it was embroidered and multicoloured after [[1945]], and later golden since [[1970]]<ref>[http://crdp.ac-bordeaux.fr/rugby/arts/5-01-01.pdf Examples of coqs], crdp.ac-bordeaux.fr</ref>. The representation of the rooster was first realistic and detailed, later the outline was simplified, it is now abstract and stylized.

The symbol used by the French rugby team had a great success , it was later adopted by the French delegation at the Olympic games of [[1920]], the rooster is then perched on five Olympic rings<ref>[http://www.museedusport.fr/histoire_objet.php Coq, French national emblem].</ref> The rooster is well known as the symbol of French teams, French players are sometimes called ''les coqs'' and some French supporters used to bring and release a rooster on the playing field before a game starts.

The French team plays usually with a blue uniform, at least at home, for that reason they are sometimes called ''les Beus'' (The Blue). This choice lead to some problems with Scotland that could not used their own navy blue colours when they played in France. When necessary (away games in Scotland and Italy), French players wear white colours.

==Record==
===Six Nations===
Frances' only annual tournament is the [[Six Nations Championship]], which is played against five other European Nations; England, Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales. France first contested the tournament in 1910 when the Home Nations became the Five Nations (Italy would later join in 2000). Not playing during the 1932–1939 seasons, they would join again in 1947. They first won in 1954, sharing the championship with both England and Wales. France shared with Wales again the next season, but won it alone for the first time in 1959. France's longest wait for a championship spanned 37 tournaments (1910 to 1954).

{{Six Nations wins}}

===World Cup===
France have competed at every [[Rugby World Cup]] since the competitions inception in 1987. They have also made it to at least the quarter final stages of every tournament. France have figured in the semi-finals and have twice been overall runners-up. They featured in the inaugural final against the All Blacks, which they lost 29-9. France were knocked out by England in the quarter-finals of the 1991 competition - where some games were also held around France with the final in London.

In 1995 France finished third overall, defeating England 19-9 in the third/fourth place play-off. [[Thierry Lacroix]] was also the tournaments top point scorer. Like 1991, for the 1999 competition, some games were played in France, and the team made it to the final but were defeated by Australia. In 2003 they finished fourth; losing the third/fourth place game to the All Blacks. [[Frédéric Michalak]] was the tournaments second highest point scorer and [[Christophe Dominici]] was in the top ten try scorers.
