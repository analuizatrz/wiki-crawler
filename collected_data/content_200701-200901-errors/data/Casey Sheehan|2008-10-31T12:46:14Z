==Military service==
In May 2000, Sheehan enlisted in the [[United States Army]] as a light-wheeled vehicle mechanic, [[List of United States Army MOS#CMF 63 - Mechanical Maintenance|MOS 63B]]. It has been reported that he may have considered enlisting as a [[Chaplain]]'s assistant

Near the end of his active service, the U.S. invasion of [[Iraq]] began. Sheehan re-enlisted, knowing that his unit would be sent there.<ref>[http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/viewArticle.asp?articleID=1860 Cindy Sheehan Has an Agenda], ''American Chronicle''</ref> Sheehan's division, the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|First Cavalry Division]], was sent to Iraq. On March 19, 2004, Sheehan's Battery C, 1st Battalion, [[82nd Field Artillery Regiment]], arrived at [[Forward Operating Base|FOB]] War Eagle in [[Sadr City]]. On April 4, 2004, Sheehan was killed in action after volunteering to be part of a [[Quick Reaction Force]] to rescue American troops.

===Burial===
Sheehan is buried in Vacaville-Elmira Cemetery in Vacaville, California. In May 2006, his mother finally provided a tombstone at his grave following criticism that Casey, who died in 2004, lacked one. Cindy Sheehan paid for the tombstone herself, stating "It is important for the rest of Casey's family to have one... I guess the pain of seeing it etched in marble that he is dead is another pain I will have to deal with." Cindy Sheehan maintains that the U.S. "government should have paid for it because of its responsibility for his death." The [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] does provide such monuments upon request.<ref> [http://www.snopes.com/politics/war/sheehangrave.asp Claim: Cindy Sheehan failed to provide a tombstone for her son's grave -- Status: true], ''[[Urban Legends Reference Pages|Snopes]]'' </ref>
