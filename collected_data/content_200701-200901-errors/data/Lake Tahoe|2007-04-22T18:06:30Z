'''Lake Tahoe''' is a large [[Fresh water|freshwater]] [[lake]] in the [[Sierra Nevada (US)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains of the [[United States]], located along the border between [[California]] and [[Nevada]] at its major bend west of [[Carson City, Nevada|Carson City]]. The lake is known for the clarity of its water and the panorama of surrounding mountains on all sides. The area, often referred to as '''Tahoe''', is home to a number of [[ski resorts]] and summer outdoor recreation. 

==Geography==
Lake Tahoe is the second deepest lake in the United States with a maximum depth of {{Unit ft|1645|0}},<ref name="Tahoe Facts">[http://tahoe.usgs.gov/facts.html Facts About Lake Tahoe]. ''Lake Tahoe Data Clearinghouse.''</ref> trailing only [[Oregon]]'s [[Crater Lake]] at {{Unit ft|1949|0}}. Tahoe is also the twelfth [[List of lakes by depth|deepest lake in the world]], and the fourth deepest in average depth.<ref name="lakes of Earth">[http://home.comcast.net/~igpl/Lakes.html Lakes of the Earth]</ref> It is about 22 mi (35 km) long and 12 mi (19 km) wide and has 72 mi (116 km) of shoreline and a surface area of 191 square miles or 495 square kilometers. Approximately two-thirds of the shoreline is in California. The south shore is dominated by the lake's largest city, [[South Lake Tahoe, California]], which adjoins the city of [[Stateline, Nevada]], while [[Tahoe City, California]] is located on the lake's northwest shore. Although highways run within sight of the lake shore for much of Tahoe's perimeter, many important parts of the shoreline now lie within state parks or are protected by the [[United States Forest Service]].

==Natural history==
===Geology===

The Lake Tahoe Basin was formed by geologic block (normal) [[Geologic fault|faulting]] about 2 to 3 million years ago. A geologic block fault is a fracture in the Earth's crust causing blocks of land to move up or down. Uplifted blocks created the [[Carson Range]] on the east and the [[Sierra Nevada (US)|Sierra Nevada]] on the west. Down-dropped blocks (a [[graben]]) created the Lake Tahoe Basin in between. Some of the highest peaks of the Lake Tahoe Basin that formed during this process were [[Freel Peak]] at 10,891 ft (3,320 m), [[Monument Peak (Sierra Nevada)|Monument Peak]] at 10,067 ft (3,068 m) (the present [[Heavenly Ski Resort]]), [[Pyramid Peak (California)|Pyramid Peak]] at 9,983 ft (3,043 m) (in the [[Desolation Wilderness]]), and [[Mount Tallac]] at 9,735 ft (2,967 m).

Eruptions from the extinct [[volcano]] [[Mount Pluto]] formed a dam on the north side. Snowmelt filled the southern and lowest part of the basin, forming the ancestral Lake Tahoe, with rain and runoff adding additional water. 

Modern Lake Tahoe was shaped and landscaped by the scouring [[glacier|glaciers]] during the [[Ice Age]]s which began a million or more years ago. Many streams flow into Lake Tahoe, but the lake is drained only by the [[Truckee River]], which flows northeast through [[Reno, Nevada]] and into [[Pyramid Lake]], Nevada which has no outlet.

Soils of the basin are derived primarily from [[andesitic]] volcanic rocks and [[granodiorite]], with minor areas of [[metamorphic]] rock. Some of the valley bottoms and lower hillslopes are mantled with glacial [[moraine|moraines]], or glacial outwash material derived from the parent rock. Cryopsamments, Cryumbrepts, [[rockland]], rock outcrops and rubble and stony [[colluvium]] account for over 70% of the land area in the basin (see USA soil taxonomy). The basin soils (in the < 2 mm fraction) are generally 65-85% sand (0.05–2.0 mm).

===Climate===
Mean annual precipitation ranges from over 55 inches/year or 140 cm in watersheds on the west side of the basin to about 26 inches/year or 67 cm near the lake on the east side of the basin. Most of the precipitation falls as snow between November and April, although rainstorms combined with rapid snowmelt account for the largest floods. There is a pronounced annual runoff of snowmelt in late spring and early summer, the timing of which varies from year to year. In some years, summertime [[monsoon]] storms from the Great Basin bring intense rainfall, especially to high elevations on the east side of the basin. As the climate in the northern Sierra warms, hydrologists anticipate that an increasing fraction of the precipitation in basin will fall as rain rather than snow.

===Ecology===
[[Image:Fallen Leaf Lake and Lake Tahoe South Shore.jpg|right|thumb|[[Fallen Leaf Lake]] and Lake Tahoe in background from road to [[Angora Lakes]] Resort]]

Vegetation in the basin is dominated by a mixed conifer forest of [[Jeffrey pine]] (P. Jeffreyi), [[lodgepole pine]] (P. murrayana), [[white fir]] (Abies concolor), and [[red fir]] (A. magnifica). The basin also contains significant areas of [[wet meadow|wet meadows]] and [[riparian]] areas, dry [[meadow|meadows]], brush fields (with [[Arctostaphylos]] and [[Ceanothus]]) and rock [[outcrop]] areas, especially at higher elevations. Ceanothus is capable of [[Nitrogen fixation|fixing nitrogen]], but [[mountain alder]] (Alnus tenuifolia), which grows along many of the basin’s streams, springs and seeps, fixes far greater quantities, and contributes measurably to nitrate-N concentrations in some small streams.



==Human history==
===Native peoples===
The area around Lake Tahoe was originally inhabited by the [[Washoe people|Washoe]] tribe of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. Lake Tahoe was the center and heart of Washoe Indian territory, including the upper valleys of the Walker, Carson, and Truckee Rivers. The English name for lake Tahoe derives from the [[Washo language|Washo]] ''dá’aw'', "lake".<ref>Bright, William (2004). ''Native American Place Names of the United States''. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, pg. 34</ref>

===Exploration===
Lt. [[John C. Frémont]] and [[Kit Carson]] were the first non-indigenous people to see Lake Tahoe, during Fremont's second exploratory expedition. On February 14, [[1844]], while searching for the Bonaventura River he first sighted the lake from Red Lake Peak in what is now the Carson Pass. After arriving at Sutter's Fort he designated it Lake Bonpland, in honor of the French explorer and botanist [[Aimé Bonpland|Aimé Jacques Alexandre Bonpland]]. [[John Calhoun Johnson]], Sierra explorer and founder of "Johnson's Cutoff" (now Hwy 50), was the first white-man to see Meeks Bay and from a peak above the lake he named "[[Fallen Leaf Lake, California]]" after his Indian guide. His first employment in the west was in the government service, carrying the mail on snowshoes from Placerville to Nevada City, during which time he bestowed the name of Lake Bigler upon the lake in honor of California’s governor [[John Bigler]]. In 1853 William Eddy, the surveyor general of California, identified Tahoe as Lake Bigler. In 1862 the [[U.S. Department of the Interior]] first introduced the name Tahoe which continued a debate about naming the lake, in which both names were used until well into the next decade. It wasn’t until 1945 that it was finally and officially named Lake Tahoe.

The compromise to partition Tahoe between California and Nevada was reached when California became a state. Putting the state line right through the middle of the lake and then at 39 degrees north latitude, the state border obliques southeasterly towards the [[Colorado River]]. 

===Mining era===
Upon discovery of [[gold]] in the South Fork of the [[American River]] in [[1848]], thousands of west-bound gold seekers passed near the basin on their way to the gold fields. European civilization first made its mark in the Lake Tahoe basin with the [[1858]] discovery of the [[Comstock Lode]], a silver deposit just 15 miles (24 km) to the east in [[Virginia City, Nevada]]. From [[1858]] until about [[1890]], logging in the basin supplied large timbers to shore up the underground workings of the Comstock mines. The logging was so extensive that almost all of the native forest was cut. In [[1864]], Tahoe City was founded as a resort community for Virginia City, the first recognition of the basin’s potential as a destination resort area.

===Development===
[[Image:Lake tahoe and hotels 1908.jpg|right|thumb|Lake Tahoe and hotels, 1908]]

Public appreciation of the Tahoe basin grew, and during the [[Sixty-second United States Congress|1912, 1913]], and [[Sixty-fifth United States Congress|1918 congressional session]]s, unsuccessful efforts were made to designate the basin as a [[United States National Park|national park]]. During the first half of the [[20th century]], development around the lake consisted of a few vacation homes. The post-[[World War II]] population and building boom, followed by construction of gambling casinos in the Nevada part of the basin during the mid-[[1950s]], and completion of the interstate highway links for the [[1960 Winter Olympics|1960 Squaw Valley Olympics]], resulted in a dramatic increase in development within the basin. From 1960 to 1980, the permanent resident population increased from about 10,000 to greater than 50,000, and the summer population grew from about 10,000 to about 90,000. Since the 1980s, development has slowed somewhat due to land use controls.

==Environmental issues==
===Water quality===
In spite of land-use planning and export of treated [[sewage]] effluent from the basin, the lake is becoming increasingly [[eutrophic]] (richer in nutrients), with primary productivity increasing by more than 5% annually, and clarity decreasing at an average rate of 0.25 meters per year. Fine [[sediment]], much of it resulting from land disturbance in the basin, accounts for about half of the loss in clarity.

Until the early 1980s, nutrient limitation studies showed that primary productivity in the lake was nitrogen-limited. Now, after a half-century of accelerated nitrogen input (much of it from direct atmospheric deposition), the lake is phosphorus-limited. Because the volume of the lake is so large (156&nbsp;km³) and its hydraulic residence time so long (about 650 years), its eutrophication may be essentially irreversible. 

Lake Tahoe never freezes. Since 1970, it has mixed to a depth of at least 400&nbsp;m a total of 6 or 7 times. Dissolved oxygen is relatively high from top to bottom.

Analysis of the temperature records in Lake Tahoe has shown that the lake warmed (between 1969 and 2002) at an average rate of 0.015°C per year. The warming is caused primarily by increasing air temperatures, and secondarily by increasing downward long-wave radiation. Both of these factors are associated with global warming. The warming trend is reducing the frequency of deep mixing in the lake, and may have important effects on water clarity and nutrient cycling.

[[Image:Secret_Beach_-_Lake_Tahoe_East_Shore.jpg|left|thumb|Secret Beach on Lake Tahoe's "Nevada side"]]

===Ecosystem changes===
Since the [[1960s]], the Lake's food web and zooplankton populations have undergone major changes. In 1963&ndash;65, opossum shrimp (''Mysis relicta'') were introduced to enhance the food supply for the introduced kokanee salmon (''Onchorhynchus nerka''). The shrimp began feeding on the Lake's cladocerans (''Daphnia'' and ''Bosmina''), and their populations virtually disappeared by 1971. The shrimp provide a food resource for salmon and trout, but also compete with juvenile fish for zooplankton. Since the [[1970s]], the cladoceran populations have somewhat recovered, but not to former levels.

Lake Tahoe is actually a tributary watershed drainage element within the [[Truckee River]] Basin, and its sole outlet is the Truckee River, which continues on to discharge to [[Pyramid Lake]]. Because of the sensitivity of Truckee River water quality (involving two protected species, the [[cui-ui]] [[sucker fish]] and the [[Lahontan cutthroat trout]]), this drainage basin has been studied extensively. The primary investigations were stimulated by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]], who funded the development of the [[DSSAM]] model to [[hydrology transport model|analyze water quality]] below Lake Tahoe.

===Environmental protection===
Until recently construction on the banks of the Lake had been, more or less, under the control of wealthy real estate developers. [[Construction]] activities had been linked to a 'clouding' of the amazingly blue waters of the Lake. Currently, the [[Tahoe Regional Planning Agency]] is regulating construction along the shoreline (and has won two Federal Supreme Court battles over recent decisions). These regulations are unpopular with many residents, especially those in the Tahoe Lakefront Homeowners Association.

The [http://www.keeptahoeblue.org League to Save Lake Tahoe (Keep Tahoe Blue)] has been the public interest watchdog in the Lake Tahoe Basin for over 45 years. Founded when a proposal to build a four-lane highway around the lake&mdash;with a bridge over the entrance to Emerald Bay&mdash;was proposed in 1959, the League has repeatedly thwarted poorly designed development projects and environmentally unsound planning. Currently evaluating the "Pathways 2007" comprehensive plan being developed by TRPA, the League embraces responsible and diversified use of the Lake's resources while protecting and restoring its natural attributes.

Since 1980, the Lake Tahoe Interagency Monitoring Program (LTIMP) has been measuring stream discharge and concentrations of nutrients and sediment in up to 10 tributary streams in the Lake Tahoe Basin, California-Nevada. The objectives of the LTIMP are to acquire and disseminate the water quality information necessary to support science-based environmental planning and decision making in the basin. The LTIMP is a cooperative program with support from 12 federal and state agencies with interests in the Tahoe Basin. This data set, together with more recently acquired data on urban runoff water quality, is being used by the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board to develop a program (mandated by the Clean Water Act) to limit the flux of nutrients and fine sediment to the Lake.

== Tourist activities ==
Much of the area surrounding Lake Tahoe is devoted to the tourism industry and there are many restaurants, ski slopes and [[casino]]s catering to visitors. 

===Winter sports===
[[Image:Tahoe.JPG|right|thumb|Ski slopes overlooking Lake Tahoe]]
During [[ski]] season, thousands of people from all over [[Nevada]] and [[California]], including [[Las Vegas]], [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], flock to the slopes for some of the best [[skiing]] in the world. Lake Tahoe, in addition to its panoramic beauty, is well known for its [[blizzard]]s.

Some of the major ski areas in Tahoe include:
*[[Heavenly Ski Resort|Heavenly Mountain Resort]]: the largest ski area in California and Nevada, located near [[Stateline, Nevada]]
*[[Squaw Valley Ski Resort|Squaw Valley]]: the second largest ski area, known for its hosting of the 1960 [[Winter Olympics]], located near [[Tahoe City]]
*[[Alpine Meadows, California|Alpine Meadows]]: a medium sized ski area on the north shore only a few miles from Squaw Valley
*[[Diamond Peak (ski area)|Diamond Peak]]: a small ski area located in [[Incline Village, Nevada]]
*[[Northstar at Tahoe]]: a popular north shore ski area
*[[Kirkwood Mountain Resort]]: a south shore ski area which gets more snow than any other ski area in Tahoe
*[[Sierra-at-Tahoe]]: a small south shore ski area
*[[Boreal Ski Resort]]: a small ski area on [[Donner Pass]]
*[[Sugar Bowl Ski Resort]]: a medium sized ski area in Donner Pass
*[[Donner Ski Ranch]]: a very small ski area on Donner Pass
*[[Homewood Ski Resort]]: a medium sized ski area on the west shore
*[[Mount Rose Ski Resort]]: a medium sized ski area north-east of the Lake, on Slide Mountain

For an instant overview of the locations and conditions of Tahoe ski resorts, see [http://www.skibonk.com/ski/index.jsp?query=tahoe Ski Bonk's resort map].

Scattered throughout Tahoe are public and private [[sled]] parks. Some, such as Granlibakken are equipped with [[rope tow]]s to help sledders get up the hill.

Many ski areas in Tahoe also have [[Snow tubing]], such as Squaw Valley. Snow tubing is popular among people who are interested in alternative sports. Throughout Tahoe, [[Cross Country Skiing]], [[Snowmobile]] riding, and [[Snowshoe]]ing are also popular, thus there are many trails for them.

===Water sports===
[[Image:lake-tahoe.jpg|right|thumb|Southeast shore of Lake Tahoe]]

During the summer, the lake is popular for [[List of water sports|water sports]] and beach activities. The two cities most identified with the Lake Tahoe [[tourist]] area are [[South Lake Tahoe, California]] and the smaller [[Stateline, Nevada]]; smaller centers on the northern shoreline include [[Tahoe City, California|Tahoe City]] and [[Kings Beach, California|Kings Beach]].

Boating, the primary activity in Tahoe in the summer, is known worldwide. There are lakefront restaurants all over the Lake, most equipped with [[pier|dock]]s and [[buoys]] (See the restaurants section) There are all sorts of boating events, such as sailboat racing, firework shows over the lake, guided cruises, and more. Lake Tahoe also has its own [[Coast Guard]]

*Sierra Boat Company
*Ski Run Marina
*Tahoe City Marina
*Tahoe Keys Marina
*Timber Cove Marina

List of Lake Tahoe [[Cruise Ship]]s:
*M.S. Dixie

===Hiking and mountain biking===
There are hundreds of hiking/mountain biking trails all around the lake. They range in size, length, difficulty, and popularity. One of the most famous of Tahoe's trails is the [[Tahoe Rim Trail]], a 165 mile trail that circumnavigates the lake. Directly to the west of the lake is the [[Desolation Wilderness]] which provides great hiking and wilderness camping. One of the most popular trailheads is the [[Eagle Lake Trailhead]].

===Gambling===
Gambling is legal on the Nevada side of Lake Tahoe. On the North Shore is Crystal Bay and Incline Village, while Stateline is on the South Shore.

Stateline is home to 6 major casinos including:
*[[Harrah's Lake Tahoe]]
*[[Harveys]] at Tahoe, now owned by Harrah's
*[[Lake Tahoe Horizon Casino]] Resort
*[[Bill's Casino Lake Tahoe]]
*[[Mont Bleu Resort Casino]], formerly Ceaser's Lake Tahoe
*Lakeside Inn

Each having a variety of slots and table games. 
The [[Hard Rock Cafe]] is located inside of Harveys.

==Highways==
Lake Tahoe can be reached comfortably in 2 hours from the [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] area via [[U.S. Route 50]]. In winter months, chains or snow tires are sometimes required, particularly from the communites of [[Twin Bridges, California|Twin Bridges]] to [[Meyers, California|Meyers]] which is on the otherside of the [[Sierra Nevada (US)|Sierra Nevada Mountains]]. Highway 50 passes the [[Lake Tahoe Airport]] en route to shoreline communities and eventually [[Stateline, Nevada]]. The Pioneer Trail is an effective bypass for reaching the popular casinos at [[Stateline, Nevada|Stateline]] and the [[Heavenly Ski Resort|Heavenly Mountain Resort]], after which it re-connects with Highway 50. After following the eastern shoreline northbound through [[Zephyr Cove, Nevada|Zephyr Cove]] and Glenbrook, it heads sharply east over the Carson Range and down into the valley towards [[Carson City, Nevada]]. 

[[California_State_Route_89|Highway 89]] splits off before [[South Lake Tahoe, California|South Lake Tahoe]] at an intersection known as "The Y."  It traverses the western edge of the lake through the picturesque wilderness, connecting camping, fishing and hiking locations such as those at [[Emerald_Bay_State_Park|Emerald Bay State Park]], [[D._L._Bliss_State_Park|DL Bliss State Park]] and [[Camp Richardson, California|Camp Richardson]]. Further along are communities such as [[Meeks Bay, California|Meeks Bay]] and [[Tahoe City, California|Tahoe City]]. Finally the highway turns away from the lake and heads northwest towards [[Truckee, California|Truckee]].

[[California_State_Route_28|Highway 28]] completes the circuit from [[Tahoe City, California|Tahoe City]] up and around the northern shore to communites such as [[Kings Beach, California|Kings Beach]], [[Crystal Bay, California|Crystal Bay]], and into [[Incline Village, Nevada]]. Both a California and Nevada State Highway, Route 28 returns along the eastern shore to meet up with US Highway 50 near [[Spooner Lake, Nevada|Spooner Lake]].

Other roads include State Route 431, which connects to [[Reno, Nevada]], from the north shore. Drivers from the south shore would take [[U.S. Route 50]] to [[Carson City, Nevada|Carson City]] and then head north on [[U.S. Route 395]] into [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]]. [[Nevada_State_Route_207|State Route 207]], also known as the Kingsbury Grade, heads over the Carson Range and into Carson Valley communities beyond.

==Miscellaneous facts==
*Although Lake Tahoe is a natural lake, it is also used for water storage by the [[Truckee-Carson Irrigation District]] (TCID). The lake level is controlled by a [[dam]] at the lake's only outlet, the [[Truckee River]], at [[Tahoe City]]. The dam only increases the lake's capacity by 732,000 acre-feet and it only controls the top 6 feet of the lake.

*[[Emerald Bay]], in the west side of the lake, is a [[National Natural Landmark]], and is protected by [[Emerald Bay State Park]]

*[[Fannette Island]] is the lake's only island. It is also protected by Emerald Bay State Park.

*The [[Reno/Tahoe International Airport]] in [[Reno, Nevada]] and the [[Chevrolet Tahoe]] [[sport utility vehicle|SUV]] were named after the lake.

*The North Shore features the [[Cal Neva Resort]] (once owned by [[Frank Sinatra]]) which has a marked state line running through it (even through its swimming pool).

*[[Mark Twain]] accidentally started a forest fire in Lake Tahoe as described in Chapter XXIII of [[Roughing It]].

*It is mentioned in [[The Godfather Part II]] where part of the movie was filmed at the west shore development of Fleur-de-Lac

*The Vans Tahoe Cup is held at [[Northstar at Tahoe]].

*The three largest communities at Lake Tahoe are South Lake Tahoe, CA / Stateline, NV, [[Tahoe City, CA]] and Incline Village, NV. 

* There's a comunications error handling algorithm named Tahoe; there's also a variant named Reno.

* British Rock Band '[[A (band)|A]]' wrote a song called "I Love Lake Tahoe" which is available on their album [[A vs. Monkey Kong]]. The song tells of the band's yearly trips to the ski resort. Furthermore, Californian band [[Sherwood (band)|Sherwood]] wrote a song called "Lake Tahoe (for my Father)", released on their album [[Sing, But Keep Going]].
