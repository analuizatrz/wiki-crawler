'''Aimé Marie Antoine Lepercq''' ([[September 2]], [[1889]] - [[November 9]], [[1944]]) was a [[France|French]] soldier, industrialist and political figure.

Born in [[Collonges-au-Mont-d'Or]], [[Rhône (département)|Rhône]], as the eldest of nine children, he graduated from the [[École Polytechnique]] in [[1911]], and then the [[École nationale supérieure des mines de Paris|École des Mines]]. 

Lepercq fought in [[World War I]], in which he was wounded three times and decorated for valor five times, becoming ''[[Legion of Honor|Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur]]'' in [[1915]] and receiving the [[British Armed Forces]] [[Military Cross]]. After the war, he worked as an administrator of industrial properties for the [[Škoda Works|Škoda company]] in [[Czechoslovakia]]. 

On the outbreak of [[World War II]], Lepercq fought in the [[artillery]] during the [[battle of France]], and continued to fight despite orders to no longer do so, until the actual [[Armistice with France (Second Compiègne)|Compiègne armistice]] of June, [[1940]]. After a brief [[internment]] by the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]], he returned to civil life as an industrial administrator, but was fired in 1943 for speaking out against the [[Military history of France during World War II|collaborationist administration]] and the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]], regarding the ''[[Service du travail obligatoire]]'' and deportations of Frenchmen to German labor camps. 

Consequently, he became an active member of the [[French Resistance]], commanding the ''[[Free French Forces|Forces françaises de l’intérieur]]'' (FFI) in [[Île-de-France (région)|Île-de-France]]. Arrested again in [[1944]], he was set free due to the German authorities' failure to investigate, he took part in the [[Liberation of Paris]] (August of the same year), leading the FFI's attack on the [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]]. For his role in the Resistance actions, he was made a ''[[Compagnon de la Libération]]''; he was twice recipient of the [[Croix de guerre]], for his valor in both World Wars. 

He was selected by [[Charles de Gaulle]] as [[List of Finance Ministers of France|Minister of Finance]], but died soon after in a car accident near [[Lille]], and was replaced by [[René Pleven]]. He is buried in [[Cimetière des Batignolles]].
