'''Peter Popoff''' (born 1946) is a [[Germany|German]]-born [[United States|U.S.]] [[televangelist]] who has spent most of his career claiming to treat physical ailments through the use of [[faith healing]]. His ministry is based in [[Upland, California]]. He has asserted that he has the power to channel [[God]] and that God works through him to cure various ailments, and many of his [[Revival meeting|crusade services]] have involved him working alleged [[miracles]] by [[Laying on of hands|laying his hands]] upon members of the audience. Popoff is also known for sending packets of ''Miracle Spring Water'' to his viewers. He claims that the water is a solution to physical and financial problems. 

==Early career and opprobrium==

At appearances in the [[1980s]] ministry conventions, Popoff routinely and accurately stated the home addresses and specific illnesses of his audience members, a feat he allowed them to believe was due to divine [[revelation]] and "God given ability".<ref name="WDAF">{{cite news| last = Friedman | first = Jason | title = Reverend Rip-Off | publisher = [[WDAF-TV|WDAF]] Fox 4 News | date = [[2006]]-[[05-08]] | accessdate=2006-05-21 }}</ref> These claims were [[debunked]] when his actual methods were discovered in [[1987]]; when noted [[skeptic]] [[James Randi]] visited a show and discovered radio transmissions of Popoff's wife off-stage reading information which she and her aides had gathered from earlier conversation with members of the audience.<ref name="Randi">{{cite book| last = Randi | first = James | authorlink = James Randi | year = 1989 | title = The Faith Healers | publisher = Prometheus Books | id = ISBN 0-87975-535-0 }}</ref> Popoff would simply listen to these promptings with his in-ear receiver and repeat what he heard to the crowd. After tapes of these transmissions were played on the [[United States]] [[television|TV]] program ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', Popoff's popularity and viewing audiences declined sharply, and his [[religious minister|ministry]] declared [[bankruptcy]] later that year.

Popoff's shows also featured audience members who were brought on stage in wheelchairs and then rose dramatically to walk without support. These were some of Popoff's most incredible "healings," but what believing audience members and television viewers did not know is that wheelchairs were used by Popoff to seat people who were already able to walk.<ref name="Seckel">{{cite book| last = Seckel | first = Al | title = Science and the Paranormal | accessdate = 2006-05-06 | date = 1987 | chapter = God's Frequency is 39.17 MHz: The Investigation of Peter Popoff | chapterurl = http://www.skeptictank.org/popoff2.htm }}</ref>

Popoff wrote several paperbacks in the early 1980s that were published by Faith Messenger Publications but are now out of print.<ref name="books">{{cite web| url=http://www.gohastings.com/Catalog/Artist/Artist2.asp?Ctrb_Id=16806629 | title=Peter Popoff | publisher=[[GoHastings.com]] | accessdate=2006-07-10 }}</ref>

Popoff's infomercials can be seen late nights and early mornings on the [[Travel Channel]], [[BET]], and [[Comedy Central]].<ref name="TV">{{cite web | title = National Television Schedule | work = Peter Popoff Ministries | url = http://peterpopoff.org/tv/national.php | accessdate = 2006-05-06 }}</ref> He is also once again buying time on selected local stations in the U.S.<ref name="backonTV">{{cite web | title = Peter Popoff is back | work = Radio-Info | url = http://www.radio-info.com/smf/index.php/topic,42800.0.html | accessdate = 2006-07-21 }}</ref>

===Prosperity theology===
Popoff has recently appeared on late-night U.S. television as a Pentecostal healing evangelist and also in [[informercial|infomercials]].  He has promoted his "Miracle Spring Water" as a "point of contact" for divine healing. He has also preached a form of [[prosperity theology]] under the slogan "Go into business with God", claiming that God will make "divine transfers" into a viewer's "divine account". One infomercial states, "A divine transfer is a supernatural event. This is not money you're going to make from your job... God is going to supernaturally put money into your account."

Within four weeks of submitting one's address to Popoff's automated phone service, subscribers receive in the mail from Popoff (now calling himself "Prophet Peter Popoff") a three-page essay filled with elaborate biblical language and red-ink imitation handwriting. Instead of the promised "Miracle Water", included is a tiny plastic "Golden Tablet" and a "Miracle Band" (a cardboard bracelet marked simply with "JIREH", [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] for "see" but sometimes translated "provide"<ref name="jireh">{{cite web | url=http://bible.crosswalk.com/Lexicons/Hebrew/heb.cgi?number=03070&version=kjv | title=Y@hovah yireh | accessdate=2006-06-20 | work=The KJV Old Testament Hebrew Lexicon | publisher=[http://www.crosswalk.com/ Crosswalk.com] }}</ref>). Popoff purports that the "Golden Tablet" was made by God and intended to create immense wealth for the subscriber. Popoff then insists that the subscriber wear the "Miracle Band" while posting him a check for $28.30 (related to [[s:Bible (World English)/Exodus#Chapter 28|Exodus 28:30]] in some way), in order to receive further instructions on how to use the "Golden Tablet".

===Ongoing faith-healing and financial activities===
Popoff's new television programs once again feature him "healing the sick" in a manner identical to his method prior to James Randi's expos√©. 

Since making his comeback to television, there have been several reports of Popoff gaining financially from donations. Some people have received several letters from Popoff, with each succeeding letter asking for more money than previous. A recent report from [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate [[WDAF-TV]] in [[Kansas City Metropolitan Area|Kansas City]] revealed that Popoff's salary in 2004 was over $500,000, and his assets include a 2006 [[Porsche]] convertible worth $90,000. Some reporters are urging those who have donated money to Popoff in hopes of receiving "miracles" to report to the [[Attorney General]] in their state.<ref name="WDAF" />
