'''Mary Martha Sherwood''' ([[née]] Butt) ([[May 6]], [[1775]] - [[September 22]], [[1851]]) was an influential and prolific writer of [[children's literature|children's books]] in [[nineteenth century|nineteenth-century]] [[United Kingdom|Britain]]; she composed over 400 books, [[tract (literature)]]s, magazine articles and [[chapbook]]s. Among her books, many of which attained great popularity, are ''Little Henry and his Bearer'', ''The History of Henry Milner'', and ''The Fairchild Family.'' The strong evangelical fervor in her early works inspired several generations of children's writers throughout the nineteenth century.

Sherwood had a relatively uneventful life until she married Captain Henry Sherwood and moved to [[India]]. It was in India that she converted to [[evangelical Christianity]] and began to write extensively for the children of British soldiers and for the Indian children attached to the British camps. Her writings filtered back to Britain and were enthusiastically received. After spending a decade in India, the Sherwoods returned to England; both of them established schools and Sherwood continued to write voraciously, editing several children's periodicals as well. Later in the century Sherwood's works fell from favor as a different style of children's literature came into fashion, but for a century, her vision of India was the one many English-speaking children grew up reading and her religious lessons dominated the bookshelves.

==Early life==
Sherwood was born on [[6 May]] [[1775]] in Stanford, [[Worcestershire]]. She was the oldest daughter and second child of Reverend George Butt and Martha Butt; her father was named chaplain in ordinary to [[George III]] in 1784.<ref>Demers, Patricia.

Retrieved on [[21 April]] [[2007]]; Cutt, 1.</ref> Sherwood records in her diaries and in her autobiography that as a child she was imaginative and playful; she even wrote stories, a pasttime that her father encouraged. In fact, she composed stories in her head before she could even write and begged her mother to write them down for her.<ref>''The Life and Times of Mrs. Sherwood'', 33.</ref> When she was seventeen, her father helped her publish her first story, ''Traditions'' (1794).<ref>Demers, Patricia.  "[http://bert.lib.indiana.edu:2378/view/article/25397 Mary Martha Sherwood]." ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''. Retrieved on [[21 April]] [[2007]].</ref> In her autobiography, Sherwood describes her childhood as full of fairylands and endless play with her brother. She even makes the best of the "stocks" that she was forced to stand in all day while she was at her lessons.<ref>''The Life and Times of Mrs. Sherwood'', 34; Patricia Demers, "[http://bert.lib.indiana.edu:2378/view/article/25397 Mary Martha Sherwood]." ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''. Retrieved on [[21 April]] [[2007]].</ref>

It is as Sherwood matures that her memories of her life become increasingly painful. She continuously comments in her autobiography that she was tall and ungainly for her age and was prone to hiding out in the woods with her doll to escape company.<ref>''The Life and Times of Mrs. Sherwood'', 50.</ref> But all was not gloomy. She seemed to greatly enjoy attending Madame St. Quentin's School for Girls at Reading Abbey, the same school [[Jane Austen]] had attended.<ref>Demers, Patricia. "[http://bert.lib.indiana.edu:2378/view/article/25397 Mary Martha Sherwood]." ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''. Retrieved on [[21 April]] [[2007]]; Cutt, 1.</ref> Only with the intrusion of the [[French Revolution]] (the school was run by French emigres) does her happy life collapse somewhat, according to her autobiography.

Sherwood spent some of her most formative years in [[Lichfield]] surrounded by the eminent naturalist [[Erasmus Darwin]], the educational reformer [[Richard Lovell Edgeworth]], his daughter [[Maria Edgeworth]] who later became a famous writer in her own right, and the celebrated poet [[Anna Seward]].<ref>Smith, Naomi Royde. ''The State of Mind of Mrs. Sherwood.'' London: Macmillan and Co. Ltd. (1946), 2-3.</ref> While she experienced the intellectual stimulation of this group of gifted thinkers and writers, she was distressed by their lack of faith, calling [[Richard Lovell Edgeworth]] an "infidel."<ref>Darton, F. J. Harvey., ed. ''The Life and Times of Mrs. Sherwood from the Diaries of Captain and Mrs. Sherwood''. London: Wells Gardner, Darton & Co., Ltd. ([1910]), 11.</ref> Moreover, she judged Seward's actions as a female author harshly, writing in her autobiography years later that she would never model herself after a woman who wore a wig and accumulated male flatterers.<ref>''The Life and Times of Mrs. Sherwood'', 82.</ref>

When George Butt died in 1795, Sherwood, her mother and her siblings retired from their active social life and moved to Bridgnorth, Shropshire.<ref>Cutt, 2.</ref> Here Sherwood wrote a sentimental novel entitled ''Margarita'' (1802) which she sold for £40 to Mr Hazard of Bath, and ''The History Susan Grey'' (1802), a ''[[Pamela, Virtue Rewarded|Pamela]]''-like novel, which she sold for £10.<ref>Demers, Patricia.

==Marriage and India==
It is clear that according to Sherwood's memories, her childhood was the happiest part of her life. When writing her autobiography, she spent over half of it describing her childhood. On [[30 June]] [[1803]] she married her cousin Captain Henry Sherwood (1776-1849) and began life as an army wife. For several years she followed her husband wherever he went in Britain, never having a settled home. Capt. Sherwood was attached to the 53rd foot regiment and was given the position of paymaster in 1804. When she and her husband left for [[India]] in 1805, she was forced to leave their first child, Mary, behind with her mother and sister.<ref>Demers, Patricia. "[http://bert.lib.indiana.edu:2378/view/article/25397 Mary Martha Sherwood]." ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''. Retrieved on [[21 April]] [[2007]].</ref>

Sherwood's four-month trip to India was difficult; she was pregnant and the ship was attacked by French warships during the journey.<ref>Demers, Patricia. "[http://bert.lib.indiana.edu:2378/view/article/25397 Mary Martha Sherwood]." ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''. Retrieved on [[21 April]] [[2007]].</ref> The Sherwoods stayed in India for eleven years, moving from Calcutta to Dinapore to Berhampore to Cawnpore to Meerut with the army and with an ever-increasing family. Sherwood gave birth to six children in India, two of whom died in infancy.<ref>Demers, Patricial. "[http://bert.lib.indiana.edu:2378/view/article/25397 Mary Martha Sherwood]." ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''. Retrieved on [[21 April]] [[2007]].</ref> Sherwood herself reports in her autobiography being continually ill in India and after the death of her son, Henry, she began to seriously consider becoming an [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Christian]]. The chaplain to the company, Mr. Parson, convinced her, she wrote, of her "human depravity" and her need for redemption.<ref>''The Life and Times of Mrs. Sherwood'', 303.</ref> She was further convinced by the ministry of the famous missionary [[Henry Martyn]]. 

Sherwood then embarked on many evangelical activities in India, but she first had to convince the [[East India Company]] that their policy of religious neutrality was ill-conceived. Sherwood seems to have entered the fray at the right time; religious winds were shifting in Britain—there was social and political support for missionary programs to India and the Company finall approved.<ref>Cutt, 13.</ref> She established schools both for the children of the the army officers and for the local children. Sherwood discovered that the traditional teaching materials did not transfer well into an Indian environment, so she wrote her own textbooks and stories replete with Indian and army themes.<ref>Cutt, 14-6.</ref> The next writer to attempt this was [[Rudyard Kipling]] in the 1880s. Two of the most famous of these works are ''The Indian's Progress'' and ''Henry and his Bearer''. <ref>Demers, Patricia. "[http://bert.lib.indiana.edu:2378/view/article/25397 Mary Martha Sherwood]." ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''. Retrieved on [[21 April]] [[2007]].</ref>  Sherwood also adopted neglected or orphaned children from the camp as well, expanding her family several times; she found homes for those she could not adopt.<ref>Cutt, 18.</ref> In addition to running these schools, she gave birth to several more children: Lucy Elizabeth, Emily, Henry Martyn (named after her missionary hero), and Sophia. In 1816, on the advice of doctors, she and her family returned to Britain; it was thought that none of her children could survive a tropical climate.<ref>''The Life and Times of Mrs. Sherwood'', 326-7.</ref>

==Return to Britain==
When Sherwood returned to Britain the family was short on money, so, drawing on her experience in India, she decided to establish a boarding school for girls in Wick, [[Worcestershire]]. She taught English, French, astronomy, history, geography, grammar, writing and arithmetic. The school remained in operation for eight years.<ref>Demers, Patricia. "[http://bert.lib.indiana.edu:2378/view/article/25397 Mary Martha Sherwood]." ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''. Retrieved on [[21 April]] [[2007]]; Cutt, 4.</ref>  Captain Sherwood, receiving only half pay from the military, also opened a school in Henwick, Worcestershire. At the same time as Sherwood was operating her school, she wrote hundreds of works, increasing her popularity in both the United States and Britain, among which was an adaption of [[Sarah Fielding|Sarah Fielding's]] ''The Governess'', a project she had promised her mother she would undertake.<ref>Demers, Patricia. "[http://bert.lib.indiana.edu:2378/view/article/25397 Mary Martha Sherwood]." ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''. Retrieved on [[21 April]] [[2007]].</ref> Sherwood also embarked on a large and complex Old Testament project which required her to learn Hebrew; she then also taught her children Hebrew. Her husband, in order to assist her in this project, worked on a Hebrew-English concordance for ten years.<ref>Demers, Patricia. "[http://bert.lib.indiana.edu:2378/view/article/25397 Mary Martha Sherwood]." ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''. Retrieved on [[21 April]] [[2007]].</ref> 

Throughout the 1830s, the Sherwoods traveled around Europe; Sherwood's texts written during this time reflect her exposure to French culture in particular.

Interestingly, after extensively describing her life as a child and in India in her autobiography, Sherwood gives very few details regarding the last forty-odd years of her life. According to the editor of her autobiography, she was a retired, domestic woman, but certainly this view could be challenged when looking at her literary output alone.

Sherwood continued to write four and five hours a day, even into her seventies.<ref>Demers, Patricia. "[http://bert.lib.indiana.edu:2378/view/article/25397 Mary Martha Sherwood]." ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''. Retrieved on [[21 April]] [[2007]].</ref> In 1849 the Sherwoods moved to Twickenham, [[Middlesex]]; Captain Sherwood died in December of that year and Sherwood herself died shortly thereafter, on [[20 September]] [[1851]].<ref>Demers, Patricia.

==Literary career==
Sherwood's career can be broadly subdivided into three periods: 1) her romantic period (1795-1805), during which she wrote two sentimental novels; 2) her evangelical period (1810-c.1830), in which she produced her most popular and influential works; and 3) her post-evangelical period (c. 1830-1851).<ref>Cutt, M. Nancy. ''Mrs. Sherwood and her Books for Children''. London: Oxford University Press (1974), x.</ref>

Several themes pervaded Sherwood's works: "her conviction of inherent human corruption"; her belief that literature "had a catechetical utlity" for every rank of society; her belief that "the dynamics of family life" should mirror the central Christian principles; and her "virulent" anti-Catholicism.<ref>Demers, Patricia. "[http://bert.lib.indiana.edu:2378/view/article/25397 Mary Martha Sherwood]." ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''. Retrieved on [[21 April]] [[2007]].</ref> 

While in India, Sherwood wrote a series of texts based on colonial life. ''Henry and his Bearer'' (1815) tells the story of a young British boy who, on his deathbed, converts Boosy, the man who has taken care of him throughout his childhood. The book was enormously successful; it reached 37 editions by 1850 and was translated into French, German, Spanish, Hindustani, Chinese, and Sinhalese within Sherwood's lifetime.<ref>Demers, Patricia. "[http://bert.lib.indiana.edu:2378/view/article/25397 Mary Martha Sherwood]." ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''. Retrieved on [[21 April]] [[2007]].</ref> Sherwood also wrote a companion story entitled  ''Little Lucy and her Dhaye'' (1825) that told a similar story from a little British girl's perspective. She also tried to adapt ''Pilgrim's Progress'' for the Indian context; the text, ''The Indian's Progress'' (1818) focused on "the supposed depravity and pagan idolatry of Brahmans, fakirs, nautch (dance) girls, and soldiers' temporary wives."<ref>Demers, Patricia. "[http://bert.lib.indiana.edu:2378/view/article/25397 Mary Martha Sherwood]." ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''. Retrieved on [[21 April]] [[2007]].</ref> While writing this, she also composed her own version of ''Pilgrim's Progress'' for children entitled ''The Infant's Progres'' (1821). Indian settings and characters and colonial themes were a constant thread in Sherwood's texts, even after she left India: ''George Desmond'' (1821), ''Henry Milner'' (1823), its sequel ''John Marten'' (1844), and ''The Indian Orphans'' (1839) all evince this ongoing interest of Sherwood's.<ref>Demers, Patricia. "[http://bert.lib.indiana.edu:2378/view/article/25397 Mary Martha Sherwood]." ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''. Retrieved on [[21 April]] [[2007]].</ref>

Although Sherwood may have disagreed with the principles of the French Revolution, that did not stop her from modelling her own works on French children's literature that was infused with Rousseauvian ideals. For example, ''The Lady of the Manor'' was structured like [[Madame de Genlis|Madame de Genlis']] ''Tales of the Castle'', with a maternal figure telling a series of stories to a group of children; it even contained some similar themes.<ref>Cutt, 43.</ref> Sherwood also copied Arnaud Berquin's "habitual pattern of small domestic situations acted out by children under the eye of parents or fellows" and scenes from ''Henry Milner'' and ''The Fairchild Family'' closely resemble those from Berquin's books.<ref>Cutt, 43.</ref>

Although ''The Fairchild Family'' has gained a reputation in the twentieth-century as an oppressively didactic book, in the early nineteenth century, according to Cutt, the book was viewed as having "the vitality and texture of real life; its remarkably naughty children . . . were refreshingly different from the perfect beings of most early Victorian books.”<ref>Cutt, 67.</ref> Sherwood's text includes hyms by [[Philip Doddridge]], [[Isaac Watts]], [[Charles Wesley]], [[William Cowper]] and [[Ann Taylor (poet)|Ann]] and [[Jane Taylor]], among others; unfortunately, she did cite the authors of these hymns in her text.<ref>Cutt, 77.</ref>

''Henry Milner'' was one of Sherwood's most successful books; in fact, children wrote to her begging her to write a sequel—one even sent her "ornamental pens" to do so. Babies were even named after the hero.<ref>Smith, 62.</ref>
