'''Prairie Avenue''' is a north–south thoroughfare on the [[South side (Chicago)|South Side of Chicago]], which historically extended from 16th street in the [[Near South Side, Chicago|Near South Side]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]] of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] in [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], [[Illinois]], [[United States|USA]] to the city's southern limits and beyond. The street has a rich history from its origins as a major [[trail]] for [[horseback rider]]s and [[carriage]]s. During the last three decades of the 19th century, a six-[[City block|block]] section of the street served as the residence of many of Chicago’s elite families and an additional four-block section was also known for grand homes. The upper six-block section includes the historic [[Prairie Avenue District]], which was declared a [[Chicago Landmark]] and added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

Several of Chicago's most important [[history of Chicago|historical figures]] have lived on the street. This is especially true of the period of recovery from the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871 when many of the most important families in the city moved to the street. Residents of the street have influenced the evolution of the city and have played prominent national and international roles. They have influenced the [[political history of Chicago|political history]], the [[Chicago architecture|architecture]], the [[culture of Chicago|culture]], the [[economy of Chicago|economy]], as well as the [[law and government of Chicago]]. The street has over time been influenced by the [[demographics of Chicago]]. 

The importance of the street has declined, but it still has landmark buildings and is the backbone of an historic district. Additionally, the street is being redeveloped to host valuable and important condominiums. Recently, developments have extended the street north to accommodate new [[high-rise]] [[condominiums]] along [[Roosevelt Road (Chicago)|Roosevelt Road]] (12th street).  The redevelopment has extended the street so that it has prominent buildings bordering [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]] with Prairie Avenue addresses.

==History==
{{double image|right|Potter Palmer.jpg |125|Bertha Honore Palmer.jpg|88|When [[Potter Palmer]]'s wife [[Bertha Palmer]] built the [[Palmer Mansion]], many Prairie Avenue residents moved to the [[Near North Side, Chicago#Gold Coast|Gold Coast]].}}
Prairie Avenue once served as an [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] trail linking [[Fort Dearborn]] to [[Forts of Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]] in [[Indiana]] and thus derived its name from the vast [[midwest]]ern [[prairie]] land between the two endpoints.<ref name=SCRS/>  In 1812, the [[Fort Dearborn massacre]] occurred in the area that is now the northern section of the street, in what is known as the [[Near South Side, Chicago|Near South Side]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Chicago School of Architecture Foundation |coauthors=Prairie Avenue Historic District Committee |title=Prairie Avenue Historic District |accessdate=2007-11-14|year=1975 |month=June }}</ref>

Over time, the district has evolved from an upscale neighborhood to a factory district and back to an upscale neighborhood. Zoning in 1853 anticipated residential development, although only one grand villa existed at the time. By 1877, the eleven-block area of Prairie Avenue, as well as Calumet Avenue, housed elite residences. By 1886, the finest mansions in the city, each equipped with its own carriage house, stood on Prairie Avenue.<ref name=NC>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/11413_em.html|accessdate=2007-10-18|author=Conzen, Michael P., Douglas Knox and Dennis McClendon|title=Neighborhood Change: Prairie Avenue, 1853-2003|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|date=2005|publisher=Chicago Historical Society}}</ref>  In the 1880s and 1890s, mansions for [[George Pullman]], [[Marshall Field]], [[John J. Glessner]] and [[Philip Armour]] anchored a neighborhood of over fifty mansions known as "Millionaire's Row". However, after [[Bertha Palmer]], society wife of [[Potter Palmer]], built the [[Palmer Mansion]] that anchored the [[Near North Side, Chicago#Gold Coast|Gold Coast]] along [[Lake Shore Drive]], the elite residents began to move north.<ref name=SCRS/>

By 1911, warehouses and factories cramped the Prairie Avenue District. Large industry overtook the district by 1950. Early twenty-first century deindustrialization, urban congestion, and historic preservation have brought the return of trendy buildings and restored as well as renovated structures. Simultaneously, new infill housing is resuscitating the district.<ref name=NC/>  Now, the historic northern section of the street is part of the [[Chicago Landmark]] Prairie Avenue District that is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=PAD>{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.chi.il.us/Landmarks/P/PrairieAveDistrict.html|title=Prairie Avenue District|accessdate=2007-10-18|publisher=City of Chicago Department of Planning and Development, Landmarks Division.|date=2003}}</ref><ref name=NRPHdc>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/IL/Cook/state7.html|accessdate=2007-12-06|title=National Register of Historic Places: Illinois - Cook County|publisher=National Register of Historic Places.com|date=}}</ref> It was declared a Chicago Landmark on December 27, 1979 and added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 15, 1972.<ref name=PAD/><ref name="nris">{{cite web|url=http://www.nr.nps.gov/|title=National Register Information System|date=2007-01-23|work=National Register of Historic Places|publisher=National Park Service}}</ref>  The historic district includes the 1800 and 1900-blocks of South Prairie, the 1800 block of South Indiana and 211 through 217 East Cullerton.<ref name=ATM/>

In the 1850s, railroad related industries prospered near the lumber district along the South Branch of the [[Chicago River]]. Thus, the business district began to supplant the elegant residences along [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan]] and Wabash Avenues south of Jackson Boulevard.<ref name="EOC562">{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/877.html|accessdate=2007-10-18|author=McClendon, Dennis|title=Near South Side|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|date=2005|publisher=Chicago Historical Society}}</ref> Shortly after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the city's wealthy residents settled on Prairie Avenue due to its proximity to the [[Chicago Loop|Loop]] less than a mile away and the fact that traveling there did not involve crossing the [[Chicago River]]. In 1870, [[Daniel Thompson]] erected the first large upper-Prairie Avenue home.  [[Marshall Field]] followed in 1871 with a [[Richard Morris Hunt]] design.<ref name="EOC644">{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1003.html|accessdate=2007-10-18|author=Carey, Heidi Pawlaoski|title=Prairie Avenue|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|date=2005|publisher=Chicago Historical Society}}</ref>  Prairie Avenue was the most posh Chicago address by the time of the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871.<ref name="EOC562"/>

Many of Chicago’s elite families settled along Prairie Avenue. By the 1870s and 1880s, Prairie Avenue was the location of elaborate houses between 16th Street and 22nd Street (now [[Cermak Road]]).<ref name="EOC771">{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1177.html|accessdate=2007-10-18|author=Pacyga, Dominic A.|title=South Side|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|date=2005|publisher=Chicago Historical Society}}</ref> In 1886, the urban elite, including [[George Pullman]], [[Marshall Field]], [[Philip Armour]] and John B.

Businesses, such as the [[Pullman Company]], [[Armour & Company]] and [[D. H.

However, as the turn of the century came, industry’s pervasive reach, increased railroad soot, and an encroaching vice district, caused the area to become less desirable, and the social elite vacated the region for quieter neighborhoods such as [[Kenwood, Chicago|Kenwood]], the [[Near North Side, Chicago#Gold Coast|Gold Coast]] and more commonly the suburban [[North Shore (Chicago)|North Shore]].<ref name="EOC772" />  The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' highlighted 1898 Prairie Avenue as a place that was undesirable to those for whom it was affordable, and unaffordable to those for whom it was desirable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/410058.html|accessdate=2007-10-18|title=Prairie Ave Gallery: Representations|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|date=2005|publisher=Chicago Historical Society}}</ref>  Light industry and vacant lots overtook Prairie Avenue during the second half of the twentieth century. The elegant mansions were mostly torn down or fell into extreme disrepair.<ref name="EOC644"/>

During the 1870s, 1880s and 1890s, upper Prairie Avenue residents were central to cultural and social fabric of the city. The economy was supported by the thousands of jobs created by the [[Pullman Car Company]] and [[Armour and Company]]. Chicago's richest man, Marshall Fields changed the buying habits of the city. John Shorthall saved the property from total chaos after the [[Great Chicago Fire]] by saving property records. At one point in the 1880s, sixteen of the 60 members of the [[Commercial Club of Chicago]] lived on Prairie Avenue.  [[George Armour]] headed the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts, which became the [[Art Institute of Chicago]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/10431_em.html|accessdate=2007-10-19|title=The Worlds of Prairie Avenue|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|date=2005|publisher=Chicago Historical Society}}</ref>  1801 South Prairie resident, [[William Wallace Kimball]], employed about 1500 people at the turn of the century in his organ and piano manufacturing company.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/2740.html|accessdate=2008-05-12|title=Kimball (W.

As a home to many of Chicago's leading families, Prairie Avenue became the base of many important political movements. Woman's [[suffrage]] had activists, such as Illinois Women Suffrage Association President Jane Jones, on Prairie Avenue.  ''Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. State of Illinois'', {{ussc|146|387|1892}}, pitted the public welfare of the city against the railroad industry and was the foundation for the public trust doctrine which facilitated the city's reclamation of much of the lakefront. Prairie Avenue residents bolstered other efforts to fight against the railroads. The concentration of wealth also made Prairie Avenue the target of complaints about taxation inequities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/410065.html|accessdate=2007-10-18|title=Prairie Ave Gallery: Prairie Avenue Politics|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|date=2005|publisher=Chicago Historical Society}}</ref>

Many of these leading families also took part in [[philanthropy]].  John Shorthall, founder of Chicago Title & Trust and Prairie Avenue resident, created the Illinois Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and convened local and state societies to unite under a national organization ([[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]]) that could combine its political strength and lobby Congress. The [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] was a successor entity of the Armour Institute of Technology, which was an outgrowth of the generosity of Philip and [[Joseph Armour]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/410062.html|accessdate=2007-10-18|title=Prairie Ave Gallery: Philanthropies|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|date=2005|publisher=Chicago Historical Society}}</ref>

==Preservation==
[[Image:Clarke House.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Pre-[[American Civil War]] photo of the [[Henry B. Clarke House]]]]
Historic preservation in Chicago has saved some of the city's architectural heritage. The efforts of the [[Chicago Architecture Foundation]] and the [[Landmarks and Preservation Council of Illinois]] have been at the forefront of these efforts. The [[Commission on Chicago Landmarks]] (now part of the city’s Department of Planning and Development) has designated the Prairie Avenue Historic District as a city landmark.<ref name="EOC383">{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/586.html|accessdate=2007-10-18|author=Sciacchitano, Barbara|title=Historic Preservation|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|date=2005|publisher=Chicago Historical Society}}</ref>  

A few of the mansions of the heyday still remain in the 1800-block including the National Historic landmark designated [[John J. Glessner House]] designed in 1886 by architect [[Henry H. Richardson]];<ref name="EOC562"/>  these provide a sense of the street's former character. This district includes the [[Henry B. Clarke House]], which although twice relocated is purported to be the city’s oldest standing house.  In addition to the Clarke House and the Glessner House, two other houses from the late-nineteenth century remain in the district.<ref name="EOC383"/>  Both the Glessner House and the Clarke House are on the [[National Historic Register]] and now serve as museums.<ref name="EOC383"/>  Most of the Prairie Avenue families worshiped at the Chicago Landmark [[Second Presbyterian Church of Chicago]], which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<ref name=CA33>{{cite book|title=Chicago Historic Resources Survey: An inventory of Architecturally and historically significant structures|chapter=Community Area #33: Near South Side|pages=258-264|year=1996|author=Commission on Chicago Landmarks and the Chicago Department of Planning and Development}}</ref>

Marshall Field lived at 1905 South Prairie and purchased 1919 South Prairie for Marshall Field, Jr.  It is believed that [[Solon Spencer Beman]] had contributed to the design of what is now known as the Marshall Field, Jr. Mansion. Then, Field hired [[Daniel Burnham]] to design extensions and additions to the property after purchasing it 1890.<ref name=ATM>{{cite web|url=http://www.marshallfieldjrmansion.com/about.php|title=About The Mansion|accessdate=2008-04-07|publisher=marshallfieldjrmansion.com}}</ref>  In 2007, the [[Commission on Chicago Landmarks]] announced the rehabilitation of the Marshall Field Jr. Mansion, which had been vacant for 40 years and which was renovated as six private residences, won a Preservation Award.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aia.org/aiarchitect/thisweek07/0921/0921n_preserve.cfm|title=Chicago Commission Honors 21 Preservation Landmarks|accessdate=2008-04-07|date=[[2007-09-21]]|publisher=[[American Institute of Architects]]|work=AIArchitect}}</ref>

In 2003, the area redevelopment was well underway. [[Deindustrialization]] and [[urbanization]] had pushed out [[manufacturing]]. As a result, factories were generally demolished, or converted to [[loft apartment]] buildings. Some neglected mansions survive as restored or renovated properties in the historic district.<ref name=NC/> Today, Prairie Avenue is undergoing a redevelopment that includes [[One Museum Park]] (1215 South Prairie Avenue) and [[One Museum Park West]] (1201 South Prairie Avenue).  These Prairie Avenue addresses border the [[Roosevelt Road]] side of [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]].  When completed, One Museum Park will be the tallest building on [[Chicago's South Side]] and among the [[tallest buildings in Chicago]].<ref name=EMP/> It will also surpass [[340 on the Park]] as the tallest all-residential building in Chicago,<ref name=EMP>{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=133771|title=One Museum Park|accessdate=2008-05-08|publisher=[[Emporis.com]]}}</ref> and it will be second to the [[Trump World Tower]] in the United States.
