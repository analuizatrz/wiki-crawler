{{nihongo|'''''Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow'''''|悪魔城ドラキュラ 蒼月の十字架|Akumajō Dorakyura: Sogetsu no Jujika|lit. "Demon Castle Dracula: Cross of the Blue Moon"}} is an [[action-adventure game]] developed and published by [[Konami]]. It is part of Konami's best-selling ''[[Castlevania]]'' [[video game series]] and the first ''Castlevania'' game to be released on the [[Nintendo DS]]. It is the sequel to Konami's ''[[Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow]]'' and incorporates many elements from its predecessor. The game was commercially successful, selling more than 15,000 units in its first week in Japan and 164,000 units in the United States three months after its initial release.<ref name="GAFJapanSales">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesarefun.com/news.php?newsid=5491|title=GAF - News - Japan: Weekly software sales for 8/22 - 8/28|publisher=gamesarefun.com|author=Freund, Josh|date=[[2005-08-31]]|accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref><ref name="DoSSalesFigures">{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgamer.com/editor/2006/q2/041706bb.html|title=RPGamer - Editorials - Crunching Numbers: DS vs. GBA|publisher=[[RPGamer]]|author=Boulette, Bryan|accessdate=2007-10-27}}</ref>

The game takes place in the [[fictional universe]] of the ''Castlevania'' series, where the vampire hunters of the [[List of Castlevania characters#The Belmont clan|Belmont clan]] wage an endless conflict against the immortal vampire [[Dracula (Castlevania)|Dracula]]. ''Dawn of Sorrow'' continues the storyline found in ''Aria of Sorrow'', in which Dracula has been completely defeated, and his powers assumed by his reincarnation, [[Characters in Castlevania: Sorrow series#Soma Cruz|Soma Cruz]]. With the help of his allies, Soma avoids becoming the new dark lord. A cult forms to bring forth a new dark lord by killing Soma. Soma and his allies move to ensure that a new dark lord is not created.

''Dawn of Sorrow'' incorporates many features from previous ''Castlevania'' games: the combination of elements from [[platform game]]s and [[console role-playing game]]s, the "Tactical Soul" system featured in ''Aria of Sorrow'', and a dark, gothic atmosphere.<ref name="GameSpotReview">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ds/action/castlevania/review.html|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow Review|author=Mueller, Greg|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=[[2005-10-05]]|accessdate=2007-06-05}}</ref><ref name="IGNReview">{{cite web|url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/655/655830p1.html|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow Review|author=Harris, Craig|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=[[2005-10-04]]|accessdate=2007-06-05}}</ref> ''Dawn of Sorrow'' also introduces new gameplay elements, such as the "Magic Seal" system, which requires the use of the [[Nintendo DS#Input and output|DS stylus]] to draw a pattern in order to defeat powerful enemies,<ref name="GameSpotReview" /> a distinctive [[anime]] character design,<ref name="IgarashiInterview">{{cite web|url=http://www.playmagazine.com/index.php?fuseaction=SiteMain.showJapanPage&Japan_ID=57|title=TGS2005 - Koji Igarashi|author=Barres, Nick Des|publisher=playonline.com|accessdate=2007-06-04}}</ref> and a multiplayer mode, where two players compete for fastest times on a prerendered level.<ref name="IGNReview" /> The game received high scores from many [[video game journalism|video game publications]], and was considered one of the best games on the Nintendo DS for 2005.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:DawnofSorrowGameplay.jpg|thumb|right|An image of gameplay, with the primary character, [[Characters in Castlevania: Sorrow series#Soma Cruz|Soma Cruz]], using the Flame Demon soul. The upper screen shows the character's statistics and information on the enemy.]]
During the game, the player controls the onscreen character from a third-person perspective to interact with people, objects, and enemies. Like previous games in the series and most [[role-playing game]]s, characters [[experience point#Level-based progression|level up]] each time they earn a set number of [[experience point]]s from defeating enemies; each "level" gained increases the character's [[Statistic (role-playing games)|statistics]], thus improving their performance in battle.<ref name="GameSpyReview">{{cite web|url=http://ds.gamespy.com/nintendo-ds/castlevania/655359p1.html|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow Review|author=Leeper, Justin|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|date=[[2005-10-04]]|accessdate=2007-01-24}}</ref> Statistics include, but are not limited to, [[hit point]]s, the amount of damage a character can receive; [[magic point]]s, which determine the amount of times a character can use magical attacks; strength, the power of a character's physical attacks; and intelligence, the power of a character's magical spells.<ref name="GUIDE10">{{cite book |editor=Konami|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow North American instruction manual|year=2005|publisher=Konami|language=English|pages=10}}</ref> Upon encountering an enemy, the player can use a variety of weapons to attack and defeat the enemy. Despite the game being set in 2036, the weapon choices are largely [[medieval]], including but not limited to [[sword]]s, [[axe]]s, and [[spear]]s, although [[handgun]]s and a [[rocket propelled grenade]] are available.<ref name="GameSpotReview"/> These weapons differ in their damage output, the range of the weapon, and the speed of the attack.<ref name="1UPReview">{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3144293|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow DS Review|author=Parish, Jeremy|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|date=[[2005-10-03]]|accessdate=2007-01-24}}</ref>

''Dawn of Sorrow'', similar to most games in the ''Castlevania'' series, is set in a castle, which is further subdivided into various areas.<ref name="GameSpotReview"/>  Areas of the castle differ in their composition, including monsters and terrain features. In addition, each area has its own unique piece of [[theme music]] that plays while the player remains in that area.<ref name="GameSpotReview"/> The character moves around the environment based on the player's choices; however, the areas the character can move into are restricted based upon the items the player has, similar to most [[platform game]]s.<ref name="GameSpotReview"/> Progression, however, is not linear, as the player is free to explore the parts of the castle they have access to, and can backtrack or move forward as they see fit.<ref name="GameSpotReview"/>

===Tactical Soul===
The primary method for the player to gain additional abilities in the game is the absorption of souls via the Tactical Soul system, which was originally featured in ''Aria of Sorrow''.<ref name="IGNReview"/> Except for human enemies and the game's final opponent, all enemies' souls can be absorbed by the player. The chances for absorbing a soul varies on the enemy, as certain enemies will release souls more regularly than others.<ref name="GUIDE14">{{cite book |editor=Konami|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow North American instruction manual|year=2005|publisher=Konami|language=English|pages=14}}</ref> The player can absorb multiple copies of the same soul; many of these souls will increase in effectiveness depending on the number of the same soul a player possesses.<ref name="1UPReview"/> These souls provide a variety of effects, and are separated into four categories: Bullet, Guardian, Enchant, and Ability souls. The player can only have one type of Bullet, Guardian, and Enchant soul equipped at any given time. However, when the player acquires the "Dopplegänger" soul, the player can have two different weapon and soul setups, and switch between them at will.<ref name="IGNReview"/> Players can trade souls wirelessly using two ''Dawn of Sorrow'' game cards.<ref name="IGNReview"/>

Bullet souls are often projectiles, and consume a set amount of magic points upon use.<ref name="GUIDE12">{{cite book |editor=Konami|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow North American instruction manual|year=2005|publisher=Konami|language=English|pages=12}}</ref> Guardian souls provide continuous effects, including transforming into mythical creatures, defensive abilities, and the summoning of [[familiar spirit|familiar]]s.<ref name="GUIDE12"/> The movement and attacking of familiars can be directly controlled with the [[Nintendo DS#Input and output|stylus]].<ref name="GameSpotReview"/> Guardian souls continually drain magic points so long as they are activated.<ref name="GUIDE12"/> Enchant souls offer statistical bonuses and resistance against several forms of attack. They are passive, and require no magic points to remain active.<ref name="GUIDE13">{{cite book |editor=Konami|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow North American instruction manual|year=2005|publisher=Konami|language=English|pages=13}}</ref> Ability souls give the player new abilities and are required to move into certain areas of the castle. They are always active, and therefore not equipped, nor do they consume magic points.<ref name="GUIDE13"/> Some examples include the ability to break ice blocks with the stylus, and the ability to double-jump.<ref name="GUIDE13"/>

Souls can alternatively be used to permanently transform a character's weapon.<ref name="GameSpyReview"/> At [[Characters in Castlevania: Sorrow series#Yoko Belnades|Yoko Belnades]]' shop, the player can remove certain souls from their inventory in order to change their weapon into a stronger form.<ref name="GameSpotReview"/> Certain weapons can only be acquired through using souls to strengthen a lesser form of the weapon.<ref name="GameSpotReview"/> Souls are also used in the "Enemy Set" mode, where a player builds a custom scenario.<ref name="GUIDE20">{{cite book |editor=Konami|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow North American instruction manual|year=2005|publisher=Konami|language=English|pages=20}}</ref> The player can place monsters inside rooms if the player has acquired the monster's soul in the main game, but boss enemies cannot be added to any scenario, even if the player has the boss' soul.<ref name="GUIDE20"/> Two players, using two Nintendo DS consoles, can compete in these scenarios, with the winner being the one with the fastest time in completing the course.<ref name="GameSpyReview"/>

[[Image:MagicSeal.jpg|thumb|right|A Magic Seal presented after defeating a boss. In this case, the player would use the [[Nintendo DS#Input and output|DS stylus]] to draw a "V" connecting the dots in order to defeat the boss.]]

===Magic Seal===
The Magic Seal system is a new feature introduced in ''Dawn of Sorrow'', and makes use of the [[Nintendo DS#Input and output|DS stylus]].<ref name="GameSpyReview"/> Once the player reduces the hit points of a "[[boss (video games)|boss]]" enemy to zero, a circle will appear, and the game will automatically draw a pattern connecting any number of smaller circles on the circumference of the larger circle.<ref name="GUIDE6">{{cite book |editor=Konami|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow North American instruction manual|year=2005|publisher=Konami|language=English|pages=6}}</ref> After this, the player will be prompted to draw the same pattern using the DS stylus in a set amount of time.<ref name="GameSpotReview"/> If the player fails to draw the pattern in time or correctly, then the boss will regain health and the battle will resume.<ref name="GUIDE7">{{cite book |editor=Konami|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow North American instruction manual|year=2005|publisher=Konami|language=English|pages=7}}</ref> If successful, the boss will be defeated.<ref name="GUIDE7"/> More powerful boss enemies require higher level Magic Seals, which have more intricate and complex patterns as the level increases and are found over the course of the game.

===Julius Mode===
After the player completes the game, Julius Mode is unlocked, similar to the Julius Mode in ''Aria of Sorrow''.<ref name="IGNReview"/> Julius Mode, in storyline terms, follows the assumption that Soma succumbed to his dark power, and became the new dark lord.<ref name="JuliusArikadoComments"> '''Julius Belmont:''' "So...Soma has become the dark lord. I have no other choice...The battles of the past are to be waged once again..." / '''Genya Arikado:''' "I had assumed that he would have equipped the talisman from Mina... It would have protected him. But alas, I will have to unleash my power..." {{cite video game|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow |developer=Konami |date=2005-10-04 |publisher=Konami Tokyo |platform=Nintendo DS |language=English}}</ref> A new game can then be started from the main menu in Julius Mode.<ref name="GUIDE4">{{cite book |editor=Konami|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow North American instruction manual|year=2005|publisher=Konami|language=English|pages=4}}</ref> In Julius Mode, the playable characters include [[Characters in Castlevania: Sorrow series#Julius Belmont|Julius Belmont]], [[Characters in Castlevania: Sorrow series#Yoko Belnades|Yoko Belnades]], and [[Alucard (Castelvania)|Alucard]].<ref name="YahooGamesReview">{{cite web|url=http://videogames.yahoo.com/ds/castlevania-dawn-of-sorrow/review-400663|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow Review | Nintendo DS Game Reviews|publisher=[[Yahoo! Games]]|author=Pavlacka, Adam|date=[[2005-10-04]]|accessdate=2007-10-26}}</ref> Each character has a weapon and an assortment of abilities unique to them, and although these abilities remain static throughout the entire game, the characters' statistics can improve by acquiring enough experience points to level up.<ref name="YahooGamesReview"/> The castle layout and enemies are the same, with the exception of the final battle, which is against Soma.<ref name="FinalBattle"> '''Julius Belmont:''' "Soma... It's time I fulfilled my promise to you." / '''Yoko Belnades:''' "I'm sorry, Soma. I will free you from your torment." / '''Alucard:''' "Soma...I never wanted it to end this way...But I can't allow you to wreak havoc anymore..." {{cite video game|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow |developer=Konami |date=2005-10-04 |publisher=Konami Tokyo |platform=Nintendo DS |language=English}}</ref>

==Plot==
===Setting===
''Dawn of Sorrow'' is set in the [[fictional universe]] of the ''Castlevania'' series. The primary premise of the series is the eternal struggle of the vampire hunters of the [[List of Castlevania characters#The Belmont clan|Belmont clan]] against the immortal vampire [[Dracula (Castlevania)|Dracula]]. Before the events of ''[[Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow]]'', Dracula was defeated and his castle sealed within a solar eclipse.<ref name="GameSpyAriaImpressions">{{cite web|url=http://gba.gamespy.com/gameboy-advance/castlevania-aria-of-sorrow/5542p1.html|title=GameSpy: Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow Preview|author=Nutt, Christian|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|date=[[2003-01-18]]|accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> A prophecy relating to who would inherit Dracula's powers drove the events of ''Aria of Sorrow'', with the protagonist, [[Characters in Castlevania: Sorrow series#Soma Cruz|Soma Cruz]], realizing that he was Dracula's reincarnation.<ref name="DracProphecy"> '''Soma:''' "So...you are trying to tell me now that Dracula has been resurrected?" / '''Graham:''' "No. Dracula perished in 1999.

===Characters===
{{main|Characters in Castlevania: Sorrow series}}
The primary playable character in ''Dawn of Sorrow'' is [[Characters in Castlevania: Sorrow series#Soma Cruz|Soma Cruz]], the [[reincarnation]] of [[Dracula (Castlevania)|Dracula]], the longtime [[antagonist]] of the ''Castlevania'' series.<ref name="OfficialCastlevaniaWebsite">{{cite web|url=http://www.konami-data.com/officialsites/castlevania|title=Official ''Castlevania'' website|publisher=[[Konami]]|accessdate=2007-06-09}}</ref> He is supported in his quest by [[Characters in Castlevania: Sorrow series#Mina Hakuba|Mina Hakuba]], the daughter of the priest of the Hakuba [[Shinto shrine|shrine]]; [[Characters in Castlevania: Sorrow series#Genya Arikado|Genya Arikado]], a mysterious government agent dealing primarily with the supernatural; [[Characters in Castlevania: Sorrow series#Julius Belmont|Julius Belmont]], the latest member of the [[List of Castlevania characters#The Belmont clan|Belmont clan]] of vampire hunters featured in the series; [[Characters in Castlevania: Sorrow series#Yoko Belnades|Yoko Belnades]], a [[witchcraft|witch]] in the service of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]; and [[Characters in Castlevania: Sorrow series#Hammer|Hammer]], a [[Supplier|vendor]] of military material who retains a large information network.<ref name="OfficialCastlevaniaWebsite" />

A cult, dedicated to the resurrection of the dark lord, serves as the game's [[antagonist]]s. [[Characters in Castlevania: Sorrow series#Celia Fortner|Celia Fortner]] is a shadow priestess at the head of the cult, and seeks to revive the dark lord in order to prevent the loss of her magical powers.<ref name="OfficialCastlevaniaWebsite" /> [[Characters in Castlevania: Sorrow series#Dmitrii Blinov|Dmitrii Blinov]] and [[Characters in Castlevania: Sorrow series#Dario Bossi|Dario Bossi]] are Celia's primary lieutenants, the former a ruthless manipulator and the latter a vicious firebrand.<ref name="OfficialCastlevaniaWebsite" /> They are the "dark lord's candidates," born on the day Dracula was slain, and thus can assume the mantle of dark lord by destroying Dracula's soul, which is present in Soma Cruz.<ref name="CeliaPlan"> '''Soma Cruz:''' "So those two are the dark lord's candidates..." / '''Celia Fortner:''' "Correct. They were born at the same time as Dracula's demise. They are inheritors of Dracula's dark powers." / '''Soma Cruz:''' "But that's no guarantee that they can become the dark lord." / '''Celia Fortner:''' "They can. By shattering Dracula's soul." {{cite video game|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow |developer=Konami |date=2005-10-04 |publisher=Konami Tokyo |platform=Nintendo DS |language=English}}</ref>

Unlike most recent ''Castlevania'' games, [[Ayami Kojima]] did not participate in the character designs for ''Dawn of Sorrow''.<ref name="IgarashiInterview"/> Instead, the characters were drawn in a distinctive [[anime]] style. This was done due to influence from producer [[Koji Igarashi]], who wanted to market the game to a younger audience.<ref name="IgarashiInterview"/> Kojima's hiatus was to allow her to concentrate upon her character designs for ''[[Castlevania: Curse of Darkness]]''.<ref name="IgarashiInterview"/>

===Story===
One year after the events in ''Aria of Sorrow'', Soma is living peacefully, and believes that his powers have been lost.<ref name="DoSBeginning"/> A woman who identifies herself as Celia Fortner, appears and summons several monsters. Arikado arrives to help Soma defeat the monsters, after which Soma absorbs their souls. Celia retreats, proclaiming that she will destroy Soma. Soma expresses disbelief at the return of his powers, but Arikado reveals that he never lost them.<ref name="PowerRetention"> '''Soma Cruz:''' "Yeah, I'm fine. But that power...It returned! Arikado, what's going on?" / '''Genya Arikado:''' "The power didn't "return." It was always with you. You just never had a need for it since you fled the castle. And that set free all the souls that you had gained dominance over." {{cite video game|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow |developer=Konami |date=2005-10-04 |publisher=Konami Tokyo |platform=Nintendo DS |language=English}}</ref> He informs Soma that Celia is the head of a cult that seeks the resurrection of the dark lord.<ref name="ArikadoCultGoal"> '''Genya Arikado:''' "They want to resurrect the lord of darkness. Like some sought to do with Dracula." / '''Soma Cruz:''' "I guess they don't like the fact that I didn't become the 'lord of darkness'." / '''Genya Arikado:''' "Not only that, they intend to create a new lord by eliminating you." {{cite video game|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow |developer=Konami |date=2005-10-04 |publisher=Konami Tokyo |platform=Nintendo DS |language=English}}</ref> He leaves, instructing Soma not to pursue Celia.

Soma, however, uses information acquired from Hammer to locate the cult's base, a facsimile of Dracula's castle.<ref name="FoundCultBase"> '''Soma Cruz:''' "So, the cult's base is here. Hammer's info wasn't so iffy after all." {{cite video game|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow |developer=Konami |date=2005-10-04 |publisher=Konami Tokyo |platform=Nintendo DS |language=English}}</ref> Hammer arrives, and as he has left the military, agrees to be Soma's vendor.<ref name="HammerVendorAgain"> '''Hammer:''' "Aw, man... Well, since I'm here, I'd better make the best of it. I guess I'm back in business, and you're my customer!" {{cite video game|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow |developer=Konami |date=2005-10-04 |publisher=Konami Tokyo |platform=Nintendo DS |language=English}}</ref> After entering the castle, Soma encounters Yoko and Julius Belmont. As Julius leaves, Soma escorts Yoko to a safe location. During this time, she instructs him in the use of a Magic Seal, which is necessary to defeat certain monsters in the castle.<ref name="MagicSealUse"> '''Yoko Belnades:''' "The cult leader appears to create gates that draw the power of darkness. Monsters exposed to that power are said to be invincible." '''Soma Cruz:''' "So how am I supposed to destroy them?" / '''Yoko Belnades:''' "That's where this Magic Seal comes in." {{cite video game|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow |developer=Konami |date=2005-10-04 |publisher=Konami Tokyo |platform=Nintendo DS |language=English}}</ref> As Soma travels farther into the castle, he meets Celia, who is flanked by two men, Dmitrii Blinov and Dario Bossi. Celia explains their nature as the "dark lord's candidates," who can become the dark lord by destroying Soma.<ref name="CeliaPlan" /> He later encounters Dmitrii and is able to defeat him. Soma gains dominance over his soul, although he acquires no abilities.<ref name="SomaAbsorbDmitrii"> '''Soma Cruz:''' "Unh! What was that? Did I gain dominance over a human soul? No, I gained no power... But...what was that light?" {{cite video game|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow |developer=Konami |date=2005-10-04 |publisher=Konami Tokyo |platform=Nintendo DS |language=English}}</ref> As Soma travels further, he comes upon Dario. Soma bests him, and Celia teleports Dario away from harm.

Soma meets Arikado, who is initially angered by Soma's presence, but accepts the situation. He gives Soma a letter and a talisman from Mina. Soma briefs Arikado on the current situation, and Arikado leaves to locate Dario. Soma comes upon Dario and Julius, with the latter defeated due to his inability to use a Magic Seal.<ref name="JuliusNoSeal"> '''Julius Belmont:''' "Watch it. He's tough. Especially for me, since I can't use Magic Seals." {{cite video game|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow |developer=Konami |date=2005-10-04 |publisher=Konami Tokyo |platform=Nintendo DS |language=English}}</ref> Dario retreats, instructing Soma to fight him in the castle's throne room. Soma does so, lambasting Dario for only desiring power, and promising to defeat him.<ref name="SomaNoble"> '''Soma Cruz:''' "Was there ever any doubt? Power is nothing if you don't know how to use it. I'll never lose to a fool dominated by his own power like you." {{cite video game|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow |developer=Konami |date=2005-10-04 |publisher=Konami Tokyo |platform=Nintendo DS |language=English}}</ref> Before the battle begins, Soma uses one of his souls to transport himself into the mirror in the room, revealing Aguni, the fire demon sealed to Dario's soul. Soma defeats Aguni, leaving Dario powerless. As Dario flees, Celia arrives, and instructs Soma to come to the castle's center.

Upon arriving, Soma is forced to watch Celia kill Mina. Furious, he begins to succumb to his dark power.<ref name="SomaEnraged"> '''Soma Cruz:''' "If it means getting Mina's revenge, I'll do it. Make me the dark lord." {{cite video game|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow |developer=Konami |date=2005-10-04 |publisher=Konami Tokyo |platform=Nintendo DS |language=English}}</ref> The talisman that Mina gave Soma is able to slow the transformation, enabling Arikado to arrive in time to inform Soma that the "Mina" that Celia killed was a [[dopplegänger]].<ref name="MinaDoppleganger"> '''Genya Arikado:''' "That Mina is a fake!" / '''Celia Fortner:''' "Arikado! Why must you always get in the way?" / '''Genya Arikado:''' "How clever of you to use a Doppelganger. Ah, but you haven't won just yet..." {{cite video game|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow |developer=Konami |date=2005-10-04 |publisher=Konami Tokyo |platform=Nintendo DS |language=English}}</ref> This aborts the transformation, but a soul exits Soma and enters the dopplegänger, which takes on the appearance of Dmitrii. Dmitrii states that he died as a gambit to copy Soma's power of dominance, and leaves with Celia to increase his strength by absorbing the souls of additional demons.<ref name="DmitriiPloy"> '''Genya Arikado:''' "You copied the power of dominance from Soma?" / '''Dmitrii Blinov:''' "Ah, so you understand. I touched the boy's soul and copied his ability." {{cite video game|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow |developer=Konami |date=2005-10-04 |publisher=Konami Tokyo |platform=Nintendo DS |language=English}}</ref> Soma and Arikado chase after the two, and find them in the castle's basement. Dmitrii, using Celia as a sacrifice, seals Arikado's powers, and engages Soma. However, his soul is unable to bear the strain of controlling the demons he has absorbed, and they erupt out of him, combining into a gargantuan creature. Soma manages to defeat the creature, but the souls that composed the demon begin to fall under Soma's dominance. He rejects them, and flees the castle with Arikado. Soma is conflicted over the present situation, as he believes it is fated that he will become the dark lord, but Arikado convinces him that his fate is not fixed.<ref name="SomaFate"> '''Soma Cruz:''' "Then that means there will always be a need for a dark lord. All because I ducked out from becoming the next in line!" / '''Genya Arikado:''' "Don't misconstrue me!

==Development==
The production of ''Dawn of Sorrow'' was announced on [[January 6]], [[2005]] as the first ''Castlevania'' game to be released on the [[Nintendo DS]].<ref name="DoSAnnounce">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ds/action/castlevania/news.html?sid=6115833|title=Konami's Renowned Castlevania Series to Make its Debut on Nintendo DS System|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=[[2005-01-06]]|accessdate=2007-10-18}}</ref> Longtime ''Castlevania'' producer [[Koji Igarashi]] was in charge of the production.<ref name="DoSAnnounce"/>  In an interview, Igarashi commented that he felt that the storyline with [[Soma Cruz]] and the Tactical Soul system were a waste to only use in one game, contributing to his desire to make a sequel.<ref name="CastlevaniaManiaIgarashiInterview">{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200507/N05.0728.1537.09250.htm|title=Castlevania Mania: The Koji Igarashi Interview|publisher=[[Game Informer]]|author=Berghammer, Billy|date=[[2005-07-28]]|accessdate=2007-10-18}}</ref> The choice to use the Nintendo DS in favor of the [[Sony]] [[PlayStation Portable]] was due to ''Aria of Sorrow''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s success on [[Nintendo]]'s [[Game Boy Advance]], and Igarashi's observations during the 2005 [[E3 Media and Business Summit]] of both consoles.<ref name="IgarashiInterviewGameInformer2">{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200501/N05.0131.1731.49293.htm|title=Castlevania: The Koji Igarashi Interview|publisher=[[Game Informer]]|author=Berghammer, Billy|date=[[2005-01-31]]|accessdate=2007-10-27}}</ref> The original design team from ''Aria of Sorrow'', as well as numerous new additions from [[Konami#Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo|Konami Tokyo]], was involved in the production of ''Dawn of Sorrow''.<ref name="IgarashiInterview"/>

The use of the technical features of the Nintendo DS was one of the production team's principle concerns during development.<ref name="CastlevaniaManiaIgarashiInterview"/> The DS touch screen was a primary point of interest, and several functions, such as picking up items on the screen and moving them, were originally intended to be incorporated.<ref name="CastlevaniaManiaIgarashiInterview"/> However, scheduling problems forced the development team to abandon many of these ideas.<ref name="CastlevaniaManiaIgarashiInterview"/> Igarashi's primary concern with using the touch screen was that it would detract from "the ''Castlevania'' pure action gameplay," in which the player would have to slow down play in order to use the stylus.<ref name="ChatofRuinIgarashiInterview">{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200606/N06.0622.1901.28664.htm|title=Castlevania’s Koji Igarashi: Chat of Ruin|publisher=[[Game Informer]]|author=Vore, Bryan|date=[[2006-06-22]]|accessdate=2007-10-18}}</ref> The [[Nintendo DS#Input and output|DS microphone]] was looked at during development, but Igarashi noted that although he found humorous uses for it, it was never seriously considered for inclusion into the game.<ref name="CastlevaniaManiaIgarashiInterview"/>

The change from the traditional dark, gothic character design of many previous ''Castlevania'' games to a new [[anime]] style was a choice made by Igarashi, who wished to market the game to a younger audience.<ref name="IgarashiInterview"/> Igarashi believed that the Nintendo DS inherently attracted a younger audience, and he was working to court them with the anime style.<ref name="GamasutraInterview">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20050815/sheffield_01.shtml|title=Gamasutra - Interview - "Whip Smart: Konami's Koji Igarashi On Mastering Castlevania"|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|author=Sheffield, Brandon|date=[[2005-08-15]]|accessdate=2007-10-19}}</ref> Furthermore, Igarashi considered the anime style a litmus test for whether future ''Castlevania'' games would incorporate it.<ref name="IgarashiInterview1UP">{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=3&cId=3138794|title=A new art style for Castlevania|author=Payton, Ryan|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|date=[[2005-11-03]]|accessdate=2007-06-04}}</ref> Igarashi had additionally intended to include a [[white collar]] Japanese worker in the game.<ref name="CastlevaniaManiaIgarashiInterview"/> This worker would be a manager in a Japanese firm and have a family as well.<ref name="CastlevaniaManiaIgarashiInterview"/> However, the development team's opposition to this idea forced him to drop this prospect.<ref name="CastlevaniaManiaIgarashiInterview"/> For the graphical representations of the numerous enemies featured in the game, Igarashi had sprites from previous ''Castlevania'' games such as ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night]]'' reused, and the development team redesigned them for use on the Nintendo DS.<ref name="IgarashiInterview"/>

===Audio===
The game's [[video game music|music]] was composed by [[Michiru Yamane]] and [[Masahiko Kimura (composer)|Masahiko Kimura]].<ref name="GameFAQsInfo"/> Yamane, a longtime composer of music for the ''Castlevania'' series, had previously worked on the music of ''Castlevania'' games such as ''Symphony of the Night'' and ''Aria of Sorrow'',<ref name="IGNCastlevaniaHistory">{{cite web|url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/756/756726p9.html|title=IGN: Castlevania: The Retrospective|publisher=[[IGN]]|author=Bozon, Mark|date=[[2007-01-18]]|accessdate=2007-10-26}}</ref> while Kimura had developed the music for ''[[Castlevania (1999 video game)|Castlevania]]'' on the [[Nintendo 64]].<ref name="Castlevania64Info">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/n64/data/196882.html|title=Castlevania Info|publisher=[[GameFAQs]]|accessdate=2007-10-26}}</ref> In an interview, Yamane noted that she made the music "simple" and "easy to recognize," similar to her work on previous ''Castlevania'' games, and she specifically drew a parallel between her work on ''Castlevania'' games for the [[Game Boy Advance]] and her music in ''Dawn of Sorrow''.<ref name="IgarashiYamaneInterview">{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200509/N05.0916.1839.57289.htm|title=TGS 2005: The Koji Igarashi & Michiru Yamane Interview|publisher=[[Game Informer]]|author=Berghammer, Billy|date=[[2005-09-16]]|accessdate=2007-10-26}}</ref> Igarashi, present in the interview, asserted that making music for [[handheld game console]]s, regardless of the type, is largely the same, although he accepted that the DS's sound capabilities were much better than those of the Game Boy Advance's.<ref name="IgarashiYamaneInterview"/>

Many reviewers noted that despite being highly similar to ''Aria of Sorrow'', it managed to define itself as a standalone title. [[GameSpot]] commented that ''Dawn of Sorrow'' succeeded in continuing 2D games as a definite genre, and that it "keeps that flame burning as bright as ever."<ref name="GameSpotReview"/> In addition, GameSpot considered it for the accolade of best Nintendo DS game of 2005, with the prize ultimately going to ''[[Mario Kart DS]]''.<ref name="GameSpotBestDS2005">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pages/features/bestof2005/index.php?day=5&page=2|title=GameSpot's Best of 2005 - Platform Awards|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=2007-10-20}}</ref> Editors at [[IGN]] awarded ''Dawn of Sorrow'' the prize of best adventure game on the DS for 2005.<ref name="IGNBestDSAdventure">{{cite web|url=http://bestof.ign.com/2005/ds/2.html|title=IGN.com presents The Best of 2005|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2007-10-20}}</ref> 

The gameplay, the Tactical Soul system in particular, received praise from reviewers. The sheer depth of abilities from the numerous souls found in the game was lauded, and IGN believed that the ability to have two customizable "profiles" of different abilities was "an extremely handy idea."<ref name="GameSpotReview"/><ref name="IGNReview"/> The necessity of finding multiple souls in order to strengthen abilities was criticized, with [[G4]]'s ''[[X-Play]]'' claiming it was "something more along the lines of ''[[Pokémon video game series|Pokémon]]'' than ''Castlevania''," and that "[the soul collecting system] is not for everyone."<ref name="XPlayReview">{{cite web|url=http://www.g4tv.com/xplay/reviews/332/Castlevania_Dawn_of_Sorrow.html|title=G4 - Reviews - Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow|publisher=[[X-Play]]|accessdate=2007-10-20}}</ref> The relative difficulty of the game and its length was also brought into question, with GameSpot noting that the game could be finished in five hours and "is fairly easy as far as ''Castlevania'' games go."<ref name="GameSpotReview"/>

GameSpot extolled the game's animation and graphics, describing the backgrounds as "intricate and gorgeous" and the individual animation, especially of enemies, as one of the game's "highlights."<ref name="GameSpotReview"/> IGN echoed this assessment, calling the animation "stunning and fluid," and noted the differences in graphics between ''Aria of Sorrow'' and ''Dawn of Sorrow'', stating that the latter was on a "broader and more impressive scale."<ref name="IGNReview"/> The utilization of an anime style of drawing the characters, as versus the traditional gothic presentation of illustrator [[Ayami Kojima]] in previous ''Castlevania'' games, was lambasted by reviewers. [[GameSpy]] deplored the "shallow, lifeless anime images" used for the characters and Kojima's absence from the production.<ref name="GameSpyReview"/> IGN believed the new images were "down to the level of 'generic Saturday morning Anime' quality."<ref name="IGNReview"/> The audio by Michiru Yamane and Masahiko Kimura was highly regarded, with GameSpot stating that it was "heads and shoulders above [''Aria of Sorrow'']."<ref name="GameSpotReview"/> IGN noted that the DS dual speaker system presented the audio "extraordinarily well."<ref name="IGNReview"/> In the review from [[1UP.com]], the game's score was compared to the soundtrack of ''Symphony of the Night'', and the sound quality and compositions considered "excellent" and "exceptional" respectively.<ref name="1UPReview"/>

The functionality associated with the Nintendo DS, namely the use of the touch screen and the Magic Seal system, was subject to criticism from reviewers. GameSpot noted that it was difficult to use the stylus immediately after the game prompted the player to draw the Magic Seal, thus forcing the player to use their fingernail on the touch screen.<ref name="GameSpotReview"/> Other functions using the touch screen, including clearing ice blocks, were viewed as trivial, with GameSpy labeling it as a "gimmick."<ref name="GameSpyReview"/> However, IGN dismissed the lack of DS functionality as a major issue, claiming that it "doesn't hurt the product in the slightest."<ref name="IGNReview"/>
