==Career==
===Youth and early career (1957-1993)===

He was born at [[Sandwell General Hospital]], [[West Bromwich]], [[Staffordshire]], and grew up in neighbouring [[Oldbury, West Midlands|Oldbury]]. He was the youngest of four children born to [[West Cornforth|West Cornforth-born]] former semi-professional footballer John Collins and his wife Doris. He has two older brothers, Keith and Terry, as well as an older sister called Norah. His father had played for [[Spennymoor United F.C.|Spennymoor United]] before the [[Second World War]], and met his mother in a local pub after Spennymoor had played [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] in an [[FA Cup]] game in 1937. He attended Moat Farm Infant School from 1961 to 1964, St. Hubert's Roman Catholic Junior School from 1964 to 1968, and then [[Warley High School|Oldbury Technical Secondary School]] from September 1968. 

He passed 2 [[O-level]]s in the summer of 1973 and was allowed to take [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-levels]] in English Language and Art, along with several O'level re-sits, at Oldbury Technical School Sixth Form. He took 4 A'levels (including English Language and Literature) at [[Warley College of Technology]] and then graduated from Birmingham Polytechnic (now [[Birmingham City University]]) in 1981 with a degree in English. This was followed by a Masters degree in English Literature at the [[University of Warwick]], the following year. After graduating, he spent four years as a lecturer in English at [[Halesowen College]], whilst being a [[stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]] on the side, before quitting his job in 1989 to pursue his comedy career full-time. During this period he quit drinking due to [[influenza]] and remains one of the UK's most high-profile recovering [[alcoholic]]s.

Collins took on the pseudonym '''Frank Skinner''' when the actors' union [[British Actors' Equity Association|Equity]] told him there was already someone of the same name on their books (their rules do not permit two members with identical names). He took the name from a member of his late father's [[dominoes]] team. Skinner had performed his first stand-up gig in 1987 and made his [[television]] debut a year later. In 1990 he co-wrote and starred in a weakly-received [[sitcom]], ''[[Packet of Three (TV series)|Packet Of Three]]'', on [[Channel 4]] but continued to see his reputation as a stand-up grow. He won the 1991 [[Perrier Award]] at the [[Edinburgh Fringe]], beating [[Jack Dee]] and [[Eddie Izzard]].

He often works with best friend and ex-flatmate [[David Baddiel]], notably on the popular late night entertainment show ''[[Fantasy Football League]]'', from 1994 to 2004 and on ''[[Baddiel and Skinner Unplanned]]'' from 2000 to 2005. 

The duo also co-wrote and performed the [[soccer|football]] song "[[Three Lions]]" with the [[Lightning Seeds]] and the [[England national football team]] for [[Euro 96]], and re-released it for the [[1998 World Cup]]. Both times the song reached #1 in the UK charts and it is widely regarded as the best of the English football anthems{{Fact|date=November 2007}}. In 2001, he released his [[autobiography]] "Frank Skinner by Frank Skinner", which became an instant bestseller. An accompanying TV show, "Frank Skinner on Frank Skinner", in which Skinner showed where he lived as a child and interviews with Skinner, his friends and family members, was recorded and shown on [[ITV]] in 2001. From 1995 to 1998, Skinner had his own chat show on [[BBC]] One, and moved it to [[ITV]] in 1999, where it ran until late 2005. He has appeared in a number of self-written sitcoms, including ''[[Blue Heaven]]'' (1994) and ''[[Shane (UK TV series)|Shane]]'' (2004). In 2003, he was listed in [[The Observer]] as one of the 50 funniest acts in British comedy. He has lived in London since 1991, but still supports [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.]]<ref>{{cite web

===Post ITV (2006-present)===

In 2005, Skinner announced he was going to leave behind his television work in favour of returning to the stand-up comedy circuit. A second series of ''Shane'' has been made, but not shown. In February 2006, he received an [[honorary degree]] from [[Birmingham City University]].<ref>{{Citation

The podcasts received a nomination for the 2007 Sony Radio Academy Awards. In May 2006, he appeared as a guest speaker at the [[Oxford Union]]. Skinner recently learned to play the banjo for a celebrity reality show, [[Play It Again#2: Frank Skinner.2C playing the banjo.|Play It Again]], which was broadcast on the BBC in March 2007. He had 3 months to learn the instrument before competing in a [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] festival. In the end, despite progressing well, he got very nervous when performing and made many mistakes.

In 2007, he announced a new live stand-up tour, his first for 10 years. On [[1 May]] he performed a warm-up gig before a sell-out crowd at the [[Swindon]] [http://www.swindon.gov.uk/artscentre Arts Centre], and followed this up on [[26 May]] at the 150 capacity Forest Arts, [[New Milton]]. His final preview performance was at the Junction Theatre, [[Cambridge]] on [[29 July]]. He will produce a [[CBS]] pilot version of ''Shane''. Skinner returned to ITV to take part in a new show, ''[http://www.itv.com/entertainment/comedy/toughgig/frankskinner Tough Gig]'', which [http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=1824734606694166109&hl=en-GB aired] on Tuesday [[12 June]] [[2007]] at 10pm, chronicling his visit to an [[Osho]] commune in Dorset.
