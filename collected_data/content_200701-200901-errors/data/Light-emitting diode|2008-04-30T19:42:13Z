A '''light-emitting diode''', usually called an '''LED''' ({{pronEng|ˌɛliːˈdiː}})<ref>{{cite web
 | url = http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/LED
 | title = LED
 | accessdate = 2008-01-04
}}</ref>, is a [[semiconductor]] [[diode]] that emits [[coherence (physics)|incoherent]] narrow-spectrum [[light]] when electrically [[Voltage bias|biased]] in the forward direction of the [[p-n junction]], as in the common [[LED circuit]]. This effect is a form of [[electroluminescence]].

An LED is usually a small area light source, often with optics added to the chip to shape its radiation pattern.<ref>{{cite paper |url=http://planck.reduaz.mx/~imoreno/Publicaciones/IODC2006.pdf |title=LED Intensity Distribution |work=International Optical Design Conference |author=I.

The [[color]] of the emitted light depends on the composition and condition of the semiconducting material used, and can be [[infrared]], [[visible spectrum|visible]], or [[ultraviolet]]. LEDs can also be used as a regular household light source. Besides lighting, interesting applications include sterilization of water and disinfection of devices.<ref name=water sterilization">[http://www.springerlink.com/content/668j066286443722/ Development of a new water sterilization device with a 365 nm UV-LED, Medical and Biological Engineering and Computing, Volume 45, Number 12 / December, 2007]</ref>

==History==

In the early 20th century, [[Henry Round]] of [[Marconi Labs]] first noted that a semiconductor junction would produce light. Russian [[Oleg Vladimirovich Losev]] independently created the first LED in the mid 1920s; his research, though distributed in Russian, German and British scientific journals, was ignored.<ref name="Zheludev_100yearhistory">{{cite journal |author=Zheludev, N. |year=2007 |title=The life and times of the LED — a 100-year history. |journal=Nature Photonics |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=189–192 |url=http://www.nanophotonics.org.uk/niz/publications/zheludev-2007-ltl.pdf |format=PDF | doi = 10.1038/nphoton.2007.34 <!--Retrieved from CrossRef by DOI bot-->}}</ref> [[Rubin Braunstein]] of the [[Radio Corporation of America]] reported on infrared emission from [[gallium arsenide|gallium arsenide (GaAs)]] and other semiconductor alloys in 1955.<ref>Braunstein, Rubin (1955).

[[Shuji Nakamura]] of [[Nichia Corporation]] of Japan demonstrated the first high-brightness blue LED based on [[Indium gallium nitride|InGaN]], borrowing on critical developments in [[Gallium nitride|GaN]] nucleation on sapphire substrates and the demonstration of p-type doping of GaN which were developed by I. Akasaki and H. Amano in Nagoya. In the 1995 Alberto Barbieri at the Cardiff University Laboratory (GB) investigated the Efficiency and Reliability of high-brightness LED demonstrating very high result by using a transparent contact made by [[indium tin oxide]] (ITO) on (AlGaInP/GaAs) LED. The existence of the blue LED and high efficiency quickly carried to the first white LED, which employed a Y<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>:Ce, or "YAG", phosphor coating to mix yellow (down-converted) light with blue to produce light that appears white. Nakamura was awarded the 2006 [[Millennium Technology Prize]] for his invention.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ia.ucsb.edu/pa/display.aspx?pkey=1475|title=2006 Millennium technolgy prize awarded to UCSB's Shuji Nakamura|accessdate=2007-05-30}}</ref>

=== Discovery ===

The first known report of a light-emitting solid-state diode was made in [[1907]] by the British experimenter [[H. J. Round]]. However, no practical use was made of the discovery for several decades.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jmargolin.com/history/trans.htm| |author=Margolin J |title=''The Road to the Transistor'', with references, including quote from Round's 1907 letter|accessdate=2007-05-30}}</ref> Independently, [[Oleg Vladimirovich Losev]] published "Luminous carborundum <nowiki>[silicon carbide]</nowiki> detector and detection with crystals" in the Russian journal ''Telegrafiya i Telefoniya bez Provodov (Wireless Telegraphy and Telephony)''.<ref name="Zheludev_100yearhistory"/> Losev's work languished for decades.

The first practical LED was invented by Nick Holonyak, Jr., in 1962 while he was at [[General Electric Company]]. The first LEDs became commercially available in late 1960s, and were red. They were commonly used as replacements for incandescent indicators, and in seven-segment displays, first in expensive equipment such as laboratory and electronics test equipment, then later in such appliances as TVs, radios, telephones, calculators, and even watches. These red LEDs were bright enough only for use as indicators, as the light output was not enough to illuminate an area. Later, other colors became widely available and also appeared in appliances and equipment. As the LED materials technology became more advanced, the light output was increased, maintaining the efficiency and the reliability to an acceptable level, therefore LEDs became bright enough to be used for illumination.

Most LEDs were made in the very common 5&nbsp;mm T1³⁄₄ and 3&nbsp;mm T1 packages, but with higher power, it has become increasingly necessary to get rid of the heat in order to keep good reliability, so the packages have become more complex and adapted for heat dissipation. Packages for state-of-the-art high power LEDs bear little resemblance to early LEDs (see, for example, [[Philips Lumileds Lighting Company|Philips Lumileds]]).

=== LED panels ===

[[Image:FremontStExperience LasVegas.JPG|thumb|right|The 1,500&nbsp;foot long LED display on the [[Fremont Street Experience]] is currently the largest in the world.]]

There are two types of LED panels: conventional, using discrete LEDs, and surface mounted device ([[Surface-mount technology|SMD]]) panels. Most outdoor screens and some indoor screens are built around discrete LEDs, also known as individually mounted LEDs. A cluster of red, green, and blue diodes is driven together to form a full-color pixel, usually square in shape. These pixels are spaced evenly apart and are measured from center to center for absolute pixel resolution. The largest LED display in the world is over 1,500&nbsp;foot (457.2&nbsp;m) long and is located in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]] covering the [[Fremont Street Experience]].

Most indoor screens on the market are built using SMD technology—a trend that is now extending to the outdoor market. An SMD pixel consists of red, green, and blue diodes mounted on a chipset, which is then mounted on the driver PC board. The individual diodes are smaller than a pinhead and are set very close together. The difference is that the maximum viewing distance is reduced by 25% from the discrete diode screen with the same resolution.

[[Image:Al Sheedakim and Panel.JPG|thumb|left|LED panels allow for smaller sets of interchangeable LEDs to be one large display.]] Indoor use generally requires a screen that is based on SMD technology and has a minimum brightness of 600 [[candela]]s per [[square meter]] (cd/m², sometimes informally called ''[[nit (unit)|nits]]''). This will usually be more than sufficient for corporate and retail applications, but under high ambient-brightness conditions, higher brightness may be required for visibility. Fashion and auto shows are two examples of high-brightness stage lighting that may require higher LED brightness. Conversely, when a screen may appear in a shot on a television show, the requirement will often be for lower brightness levels with lower color temperatures (common displays have a white point of 6500 to 9000&nbsp;K, which is much bluer than the common lighting on a television production set).

For outdoor use, at least 2,000 cd/m² is required for most situations, whereas higher-brightness types of up to 5,000 cd/m² cope even better with direct sunlight on the screen. (The brightness of LED panels can be reduced from the designed maximum, if required.)

Suitable locations for large display panels are identified by factors such as line of sight, local authority planning requirements (if the installation is to become semi-permanent), vehicular access (trucks carrying the screen, truck-mounted screens, or cranes), cable runs for power and video (accounting for both distance and health and safety requirements), power, suitability of the ground for the location of the screen (if there are no pipes, shallow drains, caves, or tunnels that may not be able to support heavy loads), and overhead obstructions.

==== Flat Panel LED TV History ====

The first known recorded flat panel LED television screen prototype was developed by James P. Mitchell in 1977. The modular, scalable display was enabled by MV50 LEDs and newly available TTL (transistor transistor logic) memory addressing circuit technology. The prototype and paper were displayed at an Engineering Exposition in [[Anaheim]] May 1978, organized by the Science Service in Washington D.C. The LED TV display received special awards and recognition from [[NASA]], [[General Motors Corporation]] and area universities including Robert M. Saunders of the The University of California Irvine, Professor of Engineering and National IEEE President 1977. Additionally, technology and business representatives from the U.S. and overseas witnessed operation of the monochromatic LED television display. The prototype remains operational. An [[LCD]] (liquid crystal display) matrix design was also presented in the accompanying scientific paper as a future alternate television display method using a similar array scanning design.

The early display prototype was red monochromatic. Low-cost efficient blue LEDs did not emerge until the early 1990s, completing the desired RGB color triad. High-brightness colors gradually emerged in the 1990s enabling new designs for outdoor signage and huge video displays for billboards and stadiums.

=== Touch sensing ===

Since LEDs share some basic physical properties with [[photodiode]]s, which also use ''p-n'' junctions with band gap energies in the visible light wavelengths, they can also be used for photo detection. These properties have been known for some time, but more recently so-called bidirectional LED matrices have been proposed as a method of [[Touchscreen|touch-sensing]]. In 2003, Dietz, Yerazunis, and Leigh published a [http://www.merl.com/publications/TR2003-035/ paper] describing the use of LEDs as cheap sensor devices.

In this usage, various LEDs in the matrix are quickly switched on and off. LEDs that are on shine light onto a user's fingers or a stylus. LEDs that are off function as photodiodes to detect reflected light from the fingers or stylus. The voltage thus induced in the reverse-biased LEDs can then be read by a microprocessor, which interprets the voltage peaks and then also uses them elsewhere.

== LED technology ==
=== Physical function ===
[[Image:Diodos LED foto.png|thumb|right|]]
Like a normal [[diode]], the LED consists of a chip of semiconducting material impregnated, or ''[[Doping (semiconductor)|doped]]'', with impurities to create a ''[[p-n junction]]''. As in other diodes, current flows easily from the p-side, or [[anode]], to the n-side, or [[cathode]], but not in the reverse direction. Charge-carriers—[[electron]]s and [[electron hole|holes]]—flow into the junction from [[electrode]]s with different [[voltage]]s. When an electron meets a hole, it falls into a lower [[energy level]], and releases [[energy]] in the form of a [[photon]].

The [[wavelength]] of the light emitted, and therefore its color, depends on the [[band gap]] energy of the materials forming the ''p-n junction''. In [[silicon]] or [[germanium]] diodes, the electrons and holes recombine by a ''non-radiative transition'' which produces no optical emission, because these are [[indirect band gap]] materials. The materials used for the LED have a [[direct band gap]] with energies corresponding to near-infrared, visible or near-ultraviolet light.

LED development began with infrared and red devices made with [[gallium arsenide]]. Advances in [[materials science]] have made possible the production of devices with ever-shorter [[wavelength]]s, producing light in a variety of colors.

LEDs are usually built on an n-type substrate, with an electrode attached to the p-type layer deposited on its surface. P-type substrates, while less common, occur as well. Many commercial LEDs, especially GaN/InGaN, also use [[sapphire]] substrate. Substrates that are transparent to the emitted wavelength, and backed by a reflective layer, and light spreading layer, increase the LED efficiency. The [[refractive index]] of the package material should match the index of the semiconductor, otherwise the produced light gets partially reflected back into the semiconductor, where it may be absorbed and turned into additional heat, thus lowering the efficiency. This type of reflection also occurs at the surface of the package if the LED is coupled to a medium with a different refractive index such as a glass fiber or air. The refractive index of most LED semiconductors is quite high, so in almost all cases the LED is coupled into a much lower-index medium. The large index difference makes the reflection quite substantial (per the [[Fresnel equations|Fresnel coefficients]]), and this is usually one of the dominant causes of LED inefficiency. Often more than half of the emitted light is reflected back at the LED-package and package-air interfaces. The reflection is most commonly reduced by using a dome-shaped (half-sphere) package with the diode in the center so that the outgoing light rays strike the surface perpendicularly, at which angle the reflection is minimized. An [[anti-reflection coating]] may be added as well. The package may be cheap plastic, which may be colored, but this is only for cosmetic reasons or to improve the contrast ratio; the color of the packaging does not substantially affect the color of the light emitted. Other strategies for reducing the impact of the interface reflections include designing the LED to reabsorb and reemit the reflected light (called ''photon recycling'') and manipulating the microscopic structure of the surface to reduce the reflectance, either by introducing random roughness or by creating programmed ''moth eye'' surface patterns.

Conventional LEDs are made from a variety of inorganic [[semiconductor materials]], producing the following colors:

* [[Aluminium gallium arsenide]] (AlGaAs) — red and [[infrared]]
* [[Aluminium gallium phosphide]] (AlGaP) — green
* [[Aluminium gallium indium phosphide]] (AlGaInP) — high-brightness orange-red, orange, yellow, and green
* [[Gallium arsenide phosphide]] (GaAsP) — red, orange-red, [[Orange (color)|orange]], and [[yellow]]
* [[Gallium phosphide]] (GaP) — red, yellow and green
* [[Gallium nitride]] (GaN) — green, pure green (or emerald green), and [[blue]] also white (if it has an AlGaN Quantum Barrier)
* [[Indium gallium nitride]] (InGaN) — 450–470 nm — near ultraviolet, bluish-green and blue
* [[Silicon carbide]] (SiC) as substrate — blue
* [[Silicon]] (Si) as substrate — blue (under development)
* [[Sapphire]] (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) as substrate — blue
* [[Zinc selenide]] (ZnSe) — blue
* [[Diamond]] (C) — ultraviolet
* [[Aluminium nitride]] (AlN), [[aluminium gallium nitride]] (AlGaN), [[aluminium gallium indium nitride]] (AlGaInN) — near to far [[ultraviolet]] (down to 210&nbsp;nm<ref>{{cite news |url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/24926 |title=LEDs move into the ultraviolet |date=[[May 17]] [[2006]] |publisher=physicsworld.com |accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref>)

With this wide variety of colors, arrays of multicolor LEDs can be designed to produce unconventional color patterns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://planck.reduaz.mx/~imoreno/Publicaciones/OptExpress2007.pdf|title=Color distribution from multicolor LED arrays |publisher=Optics Express |year=2007 |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-05-30}}</ref>

=== Ultraviolet and blue LEDs ===

[[Image:Blue LED and Reflection.JPG|thumb|right|230px|[[Ultraviolet]] GaN LEDs.]]

Blue LEDs are based on the wide [[band gap]] semiconductors GaN ([[gallium nitride]]) and InGaN (indium gallium nitride). They can be added to existing red and green LEDs to produce the impression of [[white]] light, though white LEDs today rarely use this principle.

The first blue LEDs were made in [[1971]] by Jacques Pankove (inventor of the gallium nitride LED) at [[RCA|RCA Laboratories]].<ref>{{cite web

By the late 1990s, blue LEDs had become widely available. They have an active region consisting of one or more InGaN [[quantum well]]s sandwiched between thicker layers of GaN, called cladding layers. By varying the relative InN-GaN fraction in the InGaN quantum wells, the light emission can be varied from violet to amber. AlGaN [[aluminium gallium nitride]] of varying AlN fraction can be used to manufacture the cladding and quantum well layers for ultraviolet LEDs, but these devices have not yet reached the level of efficiency and technological maturity of the InGaN-GaN blue/green devices. If the active quantum well layers are GaN, as opposed to alloyed InGaN or AlGaN, the device will emit near-ultraviolet light with wavelengths around 350–370&nbsp;nm. Green LEDs manufactured from the InGaN-GaN system are far more efficient and brighter than green LEDs produced with non-nitride material systems.

With nitrides containing aluminium, most often [[Aluminium gallium nitride|AlGaN]] and [[aluminium gallium indium nitride|AlGaInN]], even shorter wavelengths are achievable. Ultraviolet LEDs in a range of wavelengths are becoming available on the market. Near-UV emitters at wavelengths around 375–395 nm are already cheap and often encountered, for example, as [[black light]] lamp replacements for inspection of anti-[[counterfeiting]] UV watermarks in some documents and paper currencies. Shorter wavelength diodes, while substantially more expensive, are commercially available for wavelengths down to 247 nm.<ref>[http://www.s-et.com/products.htm Sensor Electronic Technology, Inc.: Nitride Products Manufacturer]</ref> As the photosensitivity of microorganisms approximately matches the absorption spectrum of [[DNA]], with a peak at about 260 nm, UV LEDs emitting at 250–270 nm are to be expected in prospective disinfection and sterilisation devices. Recent research has shown that commercially available UVA LEDs (365 nm) are already effective disinfection and sterilisation devices.<ref name=water sterilization"/>

Wavelengths down to 210 nm were obtained in laboratories using [[aluminium nitride]].

While not actually LEDs as such, ordinary NPN bipolar transistor will emit violet light if its emitter-base junction is subjected to non-destructive reverse breakdown. This is easy to demonstrate by filing the top off a metal-can transistor (BC107, 2N2222 or similar) and biasing it well above emitter-base breakdown (≥ 20 V) via a current-limiting resistor.

=== White LEDs ===
[[Image:White LED.png|thumb|right|350px|Spectrum of a “white” LED clearly showing blue light which is directly emitted by the GaN-based LED (peak at about 465 nm) and the more broadband [[Stokes shift|Stokes-shifted]] light emitted by the Ce<sup>3+</sup>:YAG phosphor which emits at roughly 500–700 nm.]]
A combination of red, green and blue LEDs can produce the impression of [[white]] light, though white LEDs today rarely use this principle.
Most “white” LEDs in production are modified blue LEDs: GaN-based, InGaN-active-layer LEDs emit blue light of wavelengths between 450&nbsp;nm and 470&nbsp;nm. This InGaN-GaN structure is covered with a yellowish [[phosphor]] coating usually made of [[cerium]]-[[Doping (Semiconductors)|doped]] [[YAG|yttrium aluminum garnet]] (Ce<sup>3+</sup>:YAG) crystals which have been powdered and bound in a type of viscous adhesive. The LED chip emits blue light, part of which is efficiently converted to a broad spectrum centered at about 580&nbsp;nm (yellow) by the Ce<sup>3+</sup>:YAG. Since yellow light stimulates the red and green receptors of the eye, the resulting mix of blue and yellow light gives the [[color vision|appearance]] of white, the resulting shade often called “lunar white”. This approach was developed by [[Nichia Corporation]] and has been used since 1996 for the manufacture of white LEDs.

The pale yellow emission of the Ce<sup>3+</sup>:YAG can be tuned by substituting the cerium with other rare earth elements such as [[terbium]] and [[gadolinium]] and can even be further adjusted by substituting some or all of the aluminum in the YAG with gallium. Due to the spectral characteristics of the diode, the red and green colors of objects in its blue yellow light are not as vivid as in broad-spectrum light. Manufacturing variations and varying thicknesses in the phosphor make the LEDs produce light with different [[color temperature]]s, from warm yellowish to cold bluish; the LEDs have to be sorted during manufacture by their actual characteristics. [[Philips Lumileds Lighting Company|Philips Lumileds]] patented conformal coating process addresses the issue of varying phosphor thickness, giving the white LEDs a more consistent spectrum of white light.

White LEDs can also be made by coating near ultraviolet (NUV) emitting LEDs with a mixture of high efficiency [[europium]]-based red and blue emitting phosphors plus green emitting copper and aluminum doped zinc sulfide (ZnS:Cu, Al). This is a method analogous to the way [[fluorescent lamp]]s work. However the ultraviolet light causes [[photodegradation]] to the [[epoxy resin]] and many other materials used in LED packaging, causing manufacturing challenges and shorter lifetimes. This method is less efficient than the blue LED with YAG:Ce phosphor, as the [[Stokes shift]] is larger and more energy is therefore converted to heat, but yields light with better spectral characteristics, which render color better. Due to the higher radiative output of the ultraviolet LEDs than of the blue ones, both approaches offer comparable brightness.

The newest method used to produce white light LEDs uses no phosphors at all and is based on [[wiktionary:homoepitaxially|homoepitaxially]] grown [[zinc selenide]] (ZnSe) on a ZnSe substrate which simultaneously emits blue light from its active region and yellow light from the substrate

A new technique developed by Michael Bowers, a graduate student at [[Vanderbilt University]] in Nashville, involves coating a blue LED with [[quantum dots]] that glow white in response to the blue light from the LED. This technique produces a warm, yellowish-white light similar to that produced by [[incandescent bulb]]s.<ref>{{cite news

=== Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) ===

{{main|Organic light-emitting diode}}

[[Image:Red-YellowGreen-Blue LED spectra.png|thumb|right|350px|Combined spectral curves for blue, yellow-green, and high brightness red solid-state semiconductor LEDs. [[Full width at half maximum|FWHM]] spectral bandwidth is approximately 24–27 nm for all three colors.]]

If the emitting layer material of the LED is an [[organic compound]], it is known as an Organic Light Emitting Diode ([[Organic light-emitting diode|OLED]]). To function as a semiconductor, the organic emitting material must have [[conjugated system|conjugated pi bonds]]. The emitting material can be a small organic [[molecule]] in a [[crystal]]line [[phase (matter)|phase]], or a [[polymer]]. Polymer materials can be flexible; such LEDs are known as PLEDs or FLEDs.

Compared with regular LEDs, OLEDs are lighter, and polymer LEDs can have the added benefit of being flexible. Some possible future applications of OLEDs could be:

* Inexpensive, flexible displays
* Light sources
* Wall decorations
* Luminous [[cloth]]

OLEDs have been used to produce visual displays for portable electronic devices such as cellphones, digital cameras, and MP3 players. Larger displays have been demonstrated, but their life expectancy is still far too short (<1,000 hours) to be practical.

=== Efficiency and operational parameters===

Most typical LEDs are designed to operate with no more than 30–60 [[milliwatt]]s (mW) of electrical power. Around 1999, [[Philips Lumileds Lighting Company|Philips Lumileds]] introduced power LEDs capable of continuous use at one [[watt]] (W). These LEDs used much larger semiconductor die sizes to handle the large power inputs. Also, the semiconductor dies were mounted onto metal slugs to allow for heat removal from the LED die.

One of the key advantages of LED-based lighting is its high efficiency, as measured by its light output per unit power input. White LEDs quickly matched and overtook the efficiency of standard incandescent lighting systems. In 2002, [[Philips Lumileds Lighting Company|Lumileds]] made five-watt LEDs available with a [[luminous efficacy]] of 18–22 [[lumen (unit)|lumens]] per watt (lm/W). For comparison, a conventional 60–100 W incandescent lightbulb produces around 15 lm/W, and standard fluorescent lights produce up to 100 lm/W. (The [[luminous efficacy]] article discusses these comparisons in more detail.)

In September 2003, a new type of blue LED was demonstrated by the company [[Cree Inc.|Cree, Inc.]] to provide 24 mW at 20 [[milliampere]]s (mA). This produced a commercially packaged white light giving 65 lm/W at 20 mA, becoming the brightest white LED commercially available at the time, and more than four times as efficient as standard incandescents. In 2006 they demonstrated a prototype with a record white LED luminous efficacy of 131 lm/W at 20 mA. Also, [[Seoul Semiconductor]] has plans for 135 lm/W by 2007 and 145 lm/W by 2008, which would be approaching an order of magnitude improvement over standard incandescents and better even than standard fluorescents.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.engadget.com/2006/12/12/seoul-semiconductor-squeezes-240-lumens-into-brightest-led/ |title=Seoul Semiconductor squeezes 240 lumens into "brightest" LED |publisher=engadget |date=[[December 12]] [[2006]] |accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref> [[Nichia Corporation]] has developed a white light LED with luminous efficacy of 150 lm/W at a forward current of 20 mA.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20061221/125713/ |title=Nichia Unveils White LED with 150 lm/W Luminous Efficiency |publisher=Tech-On! |date=[[December 21]] [[2006]] |accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref>

It should be noted that high-power (≥ 1 W) LEDs are necessary for practical general lighting applications. Typical operating currents for these devices begin at 350 mA. The highest efficiency high-power white LED is claimed by Philips Lumileds Lighting Co. with a luminous efficacy of 115 lm/W (350 mA).

====Potential of OLEDs====
Today, OLEDs operate at substantially lower efficiency than inorganic (crystalline) LEDs. The best luminous efficacy of an OLED so far is about 10% of the theoretical maximum of 683 for “white” light, or about 68 lm/W. These claim to be much cheaper to fabricate than inorganic LEDs, and large arrays of them can be deposited on a screen using simple printing methods to create a color graphical display.

=== Failure modes ===

The most common way for LEDs (and [[diode laser]]s) to fail is the gradual lowering of light output and loss of efficiency. However, sudden failures can occur as well.

The mechanism of degradation of the active region, where the radiative recombination occurs, involves [[nucleation]] and growth of [[dislocation]]s; this requires a presence of an existing defect in the crystal and is accelerated by heat, high current density, and emitted light. [[Gallium arsenide]] and [[aluminium gallium arsenide]] are more susceptible to this mechanism than [[gallium arsenide phosphide]] and [[indium phosphide]]. Due to different properties of the active regions, [[gallium nitride]] and [[indium gallium nitride]] are virtually insensitive to this kind of defect; however, high current density can cause [[electromigration]] of atoms out of the active regions, leading to emergence of dislocations and point defects, acting as nonradiative recombination centers and producing heat instead of light. [[Ionizing radiation]] can lead to the creation of such defects as well, which leads to issues with [[radiation hardening]] of circuits containing LEDs (e.g., in [[optoisolator]]s). Early red LEDs were notable for their short lifetime.

White LEDs often use one or more [[phosphor]]s. The phosphors tend to degrade with heat and age, losing efficiency and causing changes in the produced light color. Pink LEDs often use an organic phosphor formulation which may degrade after just a few hours of operation causing a major shift in output color.

High electrical currents at elevated temperatures can cause diffusion of metal atoms from the electrodes into the active region. Some materials, notably [[indium tin oxide]] and [[silver]], are subject to electromigration with the conseguence of leakage current and non radiative recombination along the chip edges. In some cases, especially with GaN/InGaN diodes, a [[barrier metal]] layer is used to hinder the electromigration effects. Mechanical stresses, high currents, and corrosive environment can lead to formation of [[whisker (metallurgy)|whiskers]], causing short circuits.

High-power LEDs are susceptible to [[current crowding]], nonhomogenous distribution of the current density over the junction. This may lead to creation of localized [[hot spot]]s, which poses risk of [[thermal runaway]]. Nonhomogenities in the substrate, causing localized loss of [[thermal conductivity]], aggravate the situation; most common ones are voids caused by incomplete [[soldering]], or by electromigration effects and [[Kirkendall voiding]]. Thermal runaway is a common cause of LED failures.

[[Laser diode]]s may be subject to [[catastrophic optical damage]], when the light output exceeds a critical level and causes melting of the facet.

Some materials of the plastic package tend to yellow when subjected to heat, causing partial absorption (and therefore loss of efficiency) of the affected wavelengths.

Sudden failures are most often caused by thermal stresses. When the [[epoxy resin]] used in packaging reaches its [[glass transition temperature]], it starts rapidly expanding, causing mechanical stresses on the semiconductor and the [[wire bonding|bonded]] contact, weakening it or even tearing it off. Conversely, very low temperatures can cause cracking of the packaging.

[[Electrostatic discharge]] (ESD) may cause immediate failure of the semiconductor junction, a permanent shift of its parameters, or latent damage causing increased rate of degradation. LEDs and lasers grown on [[sapphire]] substrate are more susceptible to ESD damage.

==Considerations in use==

[[Image:Ledmrp.jpg|thumb|right|Close-up of a typical LED in its case, showing the internal structure.]]
[[Image:+- of LED.svg|thumb|right]]

Unlike [[incandescent light bulb]]s, which light up regardless of the electrical [[Polarity (physics)|polarity]], LEDs will only light with correct electrical polarity. When the voltage across the ''p-n junction'' is in the correct direction, a significant current flows and the device is said to be ''forward-biased''. If the voltage is of the wrong polarity, the device is said to be ''reverse biased'', very little current flows, and no light is emitted. Some LEDs can be operated on an [[alternating current]] voltage, but they will only light with positive voltage, causing the LED to turn on and off at the frequency of the AC supply.

While the only definitive way to determine the polarity of the LED is to examine its datasheet, these methods are usually reliable:

|}

While it is not an officially reliable method, it is almost universally true that the cup that holds the LED die corresponds to the cathode. It is strongly recommended to apply a safe voltage and observe the illumination as a test regardless of what method is used to determine the polarity.

Because the voltage versus current characteristics of the LED are much like any [[diode]] (that is, current approximately an exponential function of voltage), a small voltage change results in a huge change in current. Added to deviations in the process this means that a [[voltage source]] may barely make one LED light while taking another of the same type beyond its maximum ratings and potentially destroying it.

Since the voltage is logarithmically related to the current it can be considered to remain largely constant over the LED's operating range. Thus the power can be considered to be essentially proportional to the current. In order to keep power nearly constant with variations in supply and LED characteristics, the power supply should be a “[[current source]]”, that is, it should supply an almost constant current. If high efficiency is not required (e.g., in most indicator applications), an approximation to a current source is made by connecting the LED in series with a current limiting resistor to a regulated voltage source.

Most LEDs have low [[breakdown voltage|reverse breakdown voltage]] ratings, so they will also be damaged by an applied reverse voltage of more than a few volts. Since some manufacturers don't follow the indicator standards above, if possible the [[data sheet]] should be consulted before hooking up the LED, or the LED may be tested in series with a [[resistor]] on a sufficiently low voltage supply to avoid the reverse breakdown. If it is desired to drive the LED directly from an AC supply of more than the reverse breakdown voltage then it may be protected by placing a diode (or another LED) in [[Antiparallel (electronics)|inverse parallel]].

LEDs can be purchased with built in series resistors. These can save [[Printed circuit board|PCB]] space and are especially useful when building [[prototype]]s or populating a PCB in a way other than its designers intended. However the resistor value is set at the time of manufacture, removing one of the key methods of setting the LED's intensity. To increase efficiency (or to allow intensity control without the complexity of a [[Digital-to-analog converter|DAC]]), the power may be applied periodically or intermittently; so long as the flicker rate is greater than the human [[flicker fusion threshold]], the LED will appear to be continuously lit.

Multiple LEDs can be connected in [[Series and parallel circuits|series]] with a single current limiting resistor provided the source voltage is greater than the sum of the individual LED threshold voltages. [[Series and parallel circuits|Parallel]] operation is also possible but can be more problematic. Parallel LEDs must have closely matched forward voltages (Vf) in order to have equal branch currents and, therefore, equal light output. Variations in the manufacturing process can make it difficult to obtain satisfactory operation when connecting some types of LEDs in parallel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nichia.co.jp/specification/appli/electrical.pdf |format=PDF |title=Electrical properties of GaN LEDs & Parallel connections |accessdate=2007-08-13 |work=Application Note |publisher=Nichia}}</ref>

Bicolor LED units contain two diodes, one in each direction (that is, two diodes in ''inverse parallel'') and each a different color (typically [[red]] and [[green]]), allowing two-color operation or a range of apparent colors to be created by altering the percentage of time the voltage is in each polarity. Other LED units contain two or more diodes (of different colors) arranged in either a ''common anode'' or ''common cathode'' configuration. These can be driven to different colors without reversing the polarity, however, more than two electrodes (leads) are required.

LEDs are usually constantly illuminated when a current passes through them, but flashing LEDs are also available. Flashing LEDs resemble standard LEDs but they contain an integrated [[multivibrator]] circuit inside which causes the LED to flash with a typical period of one second. This type of LED comes most commonly as red, yellow, or green. Most flashing LEDs emit light of a single wavelength, but multicolored flashing LEDs are available too.

Generally, for newer common standard LEDs in 3&nbsp;mm or 5&nbsp;mm packages, the following forward DC potential differences are typically measured. The forward potential difference depending on the LED's chemistry, temperature, and on the current (values here are for approx. 20 mA, a commonly-found maximum value).

Many LEDs are rated at 3 V maximum reverse potential.

LEDs also behave as [[photocell]]s, and will generate a current depending on the ambient light. They are not efficient as photocells, and will only produce a few microamperes (µA), but will produce a surprising electrical potential—as much as 2 or 3 V. This is enough to operate an amplifier or a CMOS logic gate. This effect can be used to make an inexpensive light sensor, for example to decide when to turn on the LED illuminator.

=== Advantages of using LEDs ===

[[Image:LED symbol.svg|right|250px|thumb|LED schematic symbol]]

* LEDs produce more light per watt than incandescent bulbs; this is useful in battery powered or energy-saving devices. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/ssl/usingLeds/general_illumination_efficiency_comparison.htm|title=Solid-State Lighting: Comparing LEDs to Traditional Light Sources}}</ref>
* LEDs can emit light of an intended color without the use of color filters that traditional lighting methods require. This is more efficient and can lower initial costs.
* The solid package of the LED can be designed to focus its light. Incandescent and fluorescent sources often require an external reflector to collect light and direct it in a usable manner.
* When used in applications where dimming is required, LEDs do not change their color tint as the current passing through them is lowered, unlike incandescent lamps, which turn yellow.
* LEDs are ideal for use in applications that are subject to frequent on-off cycling, unlike fluorescent lamps that burn out more quickly when cycled frequently, or HID lamps that require a long time before restarting.
* LEDs, being solid state components, are difficult to damage with external shock. Fluorescent and incandescent bulbs are easily broken if dropped on the ground.
* LEDs can have a relatively long useful life. One report estimates 35,000 to 50,000 hours of useful life, though time to complete failure may be longer.<ref>http://www.netl.doe.gov/ssl/PDFs/lifetimeWhiteLEDs_aug16_r1.pdf</ref> Fluorescent tubes typically are rated at about 30,000 hours, and incandescent light bulbs at 1,000–2,000 hours.{{Fact|date=December 2007}}
* LEDs mostly fail by dimming over time, rather than the abrupt burn-out of incandescent bulbs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/ssl/usingLeds/general_illumination_life_depreciation.htm|title=Solid-State Lighting: Lumen Depreciation}}</ref>
* LEDs light up very quickly. A typical red indicator LED will achieve full brightness in microseconds; Philips Lumileds technical datasheet DS23 for the Luxeon Star states “less than 100ns.” LEDs used in communications devices can have even faster response times.
* LEDs can be very small and are easily populated onto printed circuit boards.
* LEDs do not contain [[mercury (element)|mercury]], unlike [[compact fluorescent lamp]]s.

[[Image:Verschiedene LEDs.jpg|thumb|center|750px|LEDs are produced in an array of shapes and sizes. The 5&nbsp;mm cylindrical package (red, fifth from the left) is the most common, estimated at 80% of world production. The color of the plastic lens is often the same as the actual color of light emitted, but not always. For instance, purple plastic is often used for [[infrared]] LEDs, and most blue devices have clear housings. There are also LEDs in [[Surface-mount technology|extremely tiny packages]], such as those found on [[blinky (novelty)|blinkies]] and on cell phone keypads. (not shown).]]

=== Disadvantages of using LEDs ===

* LEDs are currently more expensive, price per lumen, on an initial capital cost basis, than more conventional lighting technologies. The additional expense partially stems from the relatively low lumen output and the drive circuitry and power supplies needed. However, when considering the total cost of ownership (including energy and maintenance costs), LEDs far surpass incandescent or halogen sources and begin to threaten compact fluorescent lamps. In December 2007, scientists at [[Glasgow University]] claimed to have found a way to make Light Emitting Diodes brighter and use less power than energy efficient light bulbs currently on the market by imprinting holes into billions of LEDs in a new and cost effective method using a process known as [[nanoimprint lithography]]. <ref Name="BBC_Rahman">{{cite web | title = New efficient bulb sees the light | work = A new type of super-efficient household light bulb is being developed which could spell the end of regular bulbs. | publisher = BBC News | date = Friday, 28 December 2007 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/glasgow_and_west/7162606.stm | format = Web | doi = | accessdate = [[January 1]], [[2008]] }}</ref>
* LED performance largely depends on the ambient temperature of the operating environment. Over-driving the LED in high ambient temperatures may result in overheating of the LED package, eventually leading to device failure. Adequate [[heat sink|heat-sinking]] is required to maintain long life. This is especially important when considering automotive, medical, and military applications where the device must operate over a large range of temperatures, and is required to have a low failure rate.
* LEDs must be supplied with the correct current. This can involve series resistors or current-regulated power supplies.<ref>[http://www.ledmuseum.org/ The Led Museum]</ref>
* The spectrum of some [[#White LEDs|white LEDs]] differs significantly from a [[black body]] radiator, such as the sun or an incandescent light. The spike at 460&nbsp;nm and dip at 500&nbsp;nm can cause the color of objects to be [[color vision|perceived differently]] under LED illumination than sunlight or incandescent sources, due to [[metamerism (color)|metamerism]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.jimworthey.com/jimtalk2006feb.html | title = How White Light Works | author = James A. Worthey | work = LRO Lighting Research Symposium, Light and Color | accessdate = 2007-10-06}}</ref> Color rendering properties of common fluorescent lamps are often inferior to what is now available in state-of-art white LEDs.
* LEDs do not approximate a “point source” of light, so cannot be used in applications needing a highly collimated beam. LEDs are not capable of providing divergence below a few degrees. This is contrasted with commercial ruby lasers with divergences of 0.2 degrees or less.<ref>Hecht, E: "Optics", Fourth Edition, page 591. Addison Wesley, 2002.</ref> This can be corrected by using lenses and other optical devices.
* There is increasing concern that [[#Ultraviolet and blue LEDs|blue LEDs]] and [[#White LEDs|white LEDs]] are now capable of exceeding safe limits of the so-called [[blue-light hazard]] as defined in eye safety specifications such as ANSI/IESNA RP-27.1-05: Recommended Practice for Photobiological Safety for Lamp and Lamp Systems.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://texyt.com/bright+blue+leds+annoyance+health+risks |title=Blue LEDs: A health hazard? |date=[[Jan 15]] [[2007]] |publisher=texyt.com |accessdate=2007-09-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Light Impacts: Science News Online, May 27, 2006|url=http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20060527/bob9.asp}} 071214 sciencenews.org</ref>

==Types==
There are three main types of LEDs: miniature, alphanumeric, and illumination.

===Miniature LEDs===
These are mostly single-die LEDs used as indicators, and they come in various-size packages:
* surface mount
* 2 mm
* 3 mm (T1)
* 5 mm (T1³⁄₄)
* Other sizes are also available, but less common.

Common package shapes:
*Round, dome top
*Round, flat top
*Rectangular, flat top (often seen in LED bar-graph displays)
*Triangular or square, flat top

The encapsulation may also be clear or semi opaque to improve contrast and viewing angle.

There are three main categories of miniature single die LEDs:
* Low current — typically rated for 2 mA at around 2 V (approximately 4 mW consumption).
* Standard — 20 mA LEDs at around 2 V (approximately 40 mW) for red, orange, yellow & green, and 20 mA at 4–5 V (approximately 100 mW) for blue, violet and white.
* Ultra-high output — 20 mA at approximately 2 V or 4–5 V, designed for viewing in direct sunlight.

====Multi-color LEDs====
A “bi-color LED” is actually two different LEDs in one case. It consists of two dies connected to the same two leads but in opposite directions. Current flow in one direction produces one color, and current in the other direction produces the another color. Alternating the two colors with sufficient frequency causes the appearance of a third color.

A “tri-color LED” is also two LEDs in one case, but the two LEDs are connected to separate leads so that the two LEDs can be controlled independently and lit simultaneously.

RGB LEDs contain red, green and blue emitters, generally using a four-wire connection with one common (anode or cathode).

====Five- and twelve-volt LEDs====
These are miniature LEDs incorporating a series [[resistor]], and may be connected directly to a 5 V or 12 V supply.

====Flashing LEDs====
These miniature LEDs flash when connected to 5 V or 12 V. Used as attention seeking indicators where it is desired to avoid the complexity of external electronics.

===Alphanumeric LEDs===
LED displays are available in [[seven-segment display|seven-segment]] and [[Starburst display|starburst]] format. Seven-segment displays handle all numbers and a limited set of letters. Starburst displays can display all letters.

Seven-segment LED displays were in widespread use in the 1970s and 1980s, but increasing use of [[liquid crystal display]]s, with their lower power consumption and greater display flexibility, has reduced the popularity of numeric and alphanumeric LED displays.

===Lighting LEDs===
[[LED lamp]]s (also called LED bars or Illuminators) are usually clusters of LEDs in a suitable housing. They come in different shapes, among them the [[light bulb]] shape with a large E27 [[Edison screw]] and [[MR16]] shape with a bi-pin base. Other models might have a small Edison [[Edison screw|E14]] fitting, [[GU5.3]] (Bipin cap) or [[Bayonet mount|GU10]] (bayonet socket). This includes low-voltage (typically 12 V halogen-like) varieties and replacements for regular AC mains (120-240 V AC) lighting. Currently the latter are less widely available but this is changing rapidly.

[[Seoul Semiconductor|Seoul Semiconductor Co., Ltd]] produces LEDs that can run directly from mains power without the need for a DC converter. For each half cycle part of the LED diode emits light and part is dark, and this is reversed during the next half cycle. Current efficiency is 80 lm/W. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ledsmagazine.com/news/3/11/14|title=Seoul Semiconductor launches AC LED lighting source Acriche |publisher=LEDS Magazine |accessdate=2008-02-17}}</ref>

=== List of LED applications ===
Some of these applications are further elaborated upon in the following text.

==== Devices, medical applications, clothing, toys ====
* [[Remote control]]s, such as for TVs and VCRs, often use [[infrared]] LEDs.
* Glowlights, as a more expensive but longer lasting and reusable alternative to [[Glowsticks]].
* Movement sensors, for example in [[Optical mouse|optical computer mice]]
* The Nintendo [[Wii]]'s sensor bar uses [[infrared]] LEDs.
* In [[optical fiber]] and [[Free Space Optics]] communications.
* Toys and recreational sporting goods, such as the [[Flashflight]]
* [[Lumalive]], a photonic [[textile]]
* In [[pulse oximeter]]s for measuring [[oxygen saturation]]
* LED [[Light therapy|phototherapy]] for acne using blue or red LEDs has been proven to significantly reduce acne over a three-month period.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}
* Some flatbed scanners use an array of red, green, and blue LEDs rather than the typical cold-cathode fluorescent lamp as the light source. Having independent control of three illuminated colors allows the scanner to calibrate itself for more accurate color balance, and there is no need for warm-up.
* Computers, for hard drive activity and power on. Some custom computers feature LED accent lighting to draw attention to a given component. Many computer manufacturers use LEDs to tell the user its current state. One example would be the Mac, which tells its user when it is asleep by fading the LED activity lights in and out, in and out.
* Sterilization of water and other substances using [[UV]] light.<ref name=water sterilization"/>

==== Lighting ====
* [[Grow lights]] composed of LEDs are more efficient, both because LEDs produce more lumens per watt than other alternatives, and also because they can be tuned to the specific wavelengths plants can make the most use of.{{Fact|date=May 2007}}
* Light bulbs
* Lanterns
* Streetlights
* Large scale video displays
* Architectural lighting
* Light source for [[machine vision]] systems, requiring bright, focused, homogeneous and possibly strobed illumination.
* [[Motorcycle]] and [[Bicycle lighting#LEDs|Bicycle lights]]
* [[Flashlight]]s, including some [[Mechanically powered flashlight|mechanically powered]] models.
* [[Emergency vehicle lighting]]
* Backlighting for [[LCD]] televisions and displays. The availability of LEDs in specific colors (RGB) enables a full-[[spectrum]] light source which expands the color [[gamut]] by as much as 45%.
* Stage lights using banks of LED's as replacement for incandescent bulbs. LED's produce less heat so LED stage lighting is cheaper to operate and reduces the risk of fire considerably.
* LED-based [[Christmas lights]] have been available since 2002, but are only now beginning to gain in popularity and acceptance due to their higher initial purchase cost when compared to similar incandescent-based Christmas lights. For example, as of 2006, a set of 50 incandescent lights might cost US$2, while a similar set of 50 LED lights might cost US$10. The purchase cost can be even higher for single-color sets of LED lights with rare or recently-introduced colors, such as purple, pink or white. Regardless of the higher initial purchase price, the [[total cost of ownership]] for LED Christmas lights would eventually be lower than the TCO for similar incandescent Christmas lights {{Fact|date=May 2007}} since the LED requires much less power to output the same amount of light as a similar incandescent bulb. More to the point, LEDs have practically unlimited life and are hard-wired rather than using unreliable sockets as do replaceable bulbs. So a set of LED lights can be expected to outlive many incandescent sets, and without any maintenance.

==== Indicators and signs ====
* Status indicators on a variety of equipment
* [[Traffic light]]s and signals
* [[Exit sign]]s
* [[Railroad crossing]] signals
* Continuity indicators
* Elevator push-button Lighting
* Thin, lightweight message displays at airports and railway stations, and as destination displays for trains, buses, trams, and ferries.
* Red or yellow LEDs are used in indicator and alphanumeric displays in environments where night vision must be retained: aircraft cockpits, submarine and ship bridges, astronomy observatories, and in the field, e.g. night time animal watching and military field use.
* Red, yellow, green, and blue LEDs can be used for [[model railroading]] applications
* In dot matrix arrangements for displaying messages.
* Because of their long life and fast switching times, LEDs have been used for automotive [[Automotive lighting#Center High Mount Stop Lamp (CHMSL)|high-mounted brake lights]] and truck and bus brake lights and turn signals for some time, but many high-end vehicles are now starting to use LEDs for their entire rear light clusters. Besides the gain in [[reliability]], this has styling advantages because LEDs are capable of forming much thinner lights than incandescent lamps with [[parabolic reflector]]s. The significant improvement in the time taken to light up (perhaps 0.5s faster than an incandescent bulb) improves safety by giving drivers more time to react. It has been reported that at normal highway speeds this equals one car length increased reaction time for the car behind. White LED headlamps are beginning to make an appearance.
* As a medium quality [[voltage reference]] in electronic circuits. The forward voltage drop (e.g., about 1.7 V for a normal red LED) can be used instead of a [[Zener diode]] in low-voltage regulators. Although LED forward voltage is much more current-dependent than a good Zener, Zener diodes are not available below voltages of about 3 V.

=== Optoisolators and optocouplers ===

{{main|Opto-isolator}}

[[Image:Optocoupler.svg|thumb|right|200px|Optocoupler schematic showing LED and phototransistor]]
The LED may be combined with a [[photodiode]] or [[phototransistor]] in a single electronic device to provide a signal path with electrical isolation between two circuits. An optoisolator will have typical breakdown voltages between the input and output circuits of typically 500–3000 V. This is especially useful in medical equipment where the signals from a low voltage [[sensor]] circuit (usually battery powered) in contact with a living organism must be electrically isolated from any possible electrical failure in a recording or monitoring device operating at potentially dangerous voltages. An optoisolator also allows information to be transferred between circuits not sharing a common ground potential. An optocoupler may not have such high breakdown voltages and may even share a ground between input and output, but both types are useful in preventing electrical noise, particularly [[Common-mode interference|common mode electrical noise]], on a sensor circuit from being transferred to the receiving circuit (where it may adversely affect the operation or durability of various components) and/or transferring a noisy signal. Optoisolators are also used in the feedback circuit of a [[Direct current|DC]] to DC converter, allowing power to be transferred while retaining electrical isolation between the input and output.

=== Light sources for machine vision systems ===

[[Machine vision]] systems often require bright and homogeneous illumination, so features of interest are easier to process.
LEDs are often used to this purpose, and this field of application is likely to remain one of the major application areas until price drops low enough to make signaling and illumination applications more widespread.
LEDs constitute a nearly ideal light source for [[machine vision]] systems for several main reasons:

* Size of illuminated field is usually comparatively small and Vision systems or [[smart camera]] are quite expensive, so cost of LEDs is usually a minor concern, compared to signaling applications.
* LED elements tend to be small and can be placed with high density over flat or even shaped substrates (PCBs etc) so that bright and homogeneous sources can be designed which direct light from tightly controlled directions on inspected parts.
* LEDs often have or can be used with small, inexpensive lenses and diffusers, helping to achieve high light densities and very good lighting control and homogeneity.
* LEDs can be easily strobed (in the microsecond range and below) and synchronized; their power also has reached high enough levels that sufficiently high intensity can be obtained, allowing well lit images even with very short light pulses: this is often used in order to obtain crisp and sharp “still” images of quickly-moving parts.
* LEDs come in several different colors and wavelengths, easily allowing to use the best color for each application, where different color may provide better visibility of features of interest. Having a precisely known spectrum allows tightly matched filters to be used to separate informative bandwidth or to reduce disturbing effect of ambient light.
* LEDs usually operate at comparatively low working temperatures, simplifying heat management and dissipation, therefore allowing plastic lenses, filters and diffusers to be used. Waterproof units can also easily be designed, allowing for use in harsh or wet environments (food, beverage, oil industries).
* LED sources can be shaped in several main configurations (spot lights for reflective illumination; ring lights for coaxial illumination; back lights for contour illumination; linear assemblies; flat, large format panels; dome sources for diffused, omnidirectional illumination).
* Very compact designs are possible, allowing for small LED illuminators to be integrated within [[smart camera]]s and vision sensors.

==Power sources==
LEDs have very low dynamic resistance, with the same voltage drop for widely varying currents. Consequently they cannot connect directly to most power sources without self destruction. A current control ballast is normally used, which is sometimes constant current.

===Indicator LEDs===
Miniature indicator LEDs are normally driven from low voltage DC via a current limiting [[resistor]]. Currents of 2 mA, 10 mA and 20 mA are common. Some low current indicators are only rated to 2 mA, and should not be driven at higher current.

Sub-mA indicators may be made by driving ultrabright LEDs at very low current. Efficacy tends to reduce at low currents, but indicators running on 100 μA are still practical. The cost of ultrabrights is higher than 2 mA indicator LEDs.

LEDs have a low max repeat reverse voltage rating, ranging from approximately 2 V to 5 V, and this can be a problem in some applications. Back to back LEDs are immune to this problem. These are available in single color as well as bicolor types. There are various strategies for reverse voltage handling.

In niche applications such as IR therapy, LEDs are often driven at far above rated current. This causes high failure rate and occasional LED explosions. Thus many parallel strings are used, and a safety screen and ongoing maintenance are required.

===Alphanumeric LEDs===
These use the same drive strategy as indicator LEDs, the only difference being the larger number of channels, each with its own resistor. Seven-segment and starburst LED arrays are available in both common-anode or common-cathode form.

===Lighting LEDs on mains===
A CR dropper followed by full wave rectification is the usual ballast with series-parallel LED clusters.

A single series string minimises dropper losses, while paralleled strings increase reliability. In practice usually three strings or more are used.

Operation on square wave and modified sine wave (MSW) sources, such as many invertors, causes heavily increased resistor [[dissipation]] in CR droppers, and LED ballasts designed for sine wave use tend to burn on non-sine waveforms. The non-sine waveform also causes high peak LED currents, heavily shortening LED life. An inductor & rectifier makes a more suitable ballast for such use, and other options are also possible.

===Lighting LEDs on low voltage===
LEDs are normally operated in parallel strings of series LEDs, with the total LED voltage typically adding up to around two-thirds of the supply voltage, with [[resistor]] [[current]] control for each string.

LED current is proportional to power supply (PSU) voltage minus total LED string voltage. Where [[battery (electricity)|battery]] sources are used, the PSU voltage can vary widely, causing large changes in LED current and light output. For such applications, a [[constant current]] regulator is preferred to resistor control. Low drop-out (LDO) [[constant current]] regs also allow the total LED string voltage to be a higher percentage of PSU voltage, resulting in improved efficiency and reduced power use.

Torches run one or more lighting LEDs on a low voltage battery. These usually use a resistor ballast.

In disposable [[button cell|coin cell]] powered keyring type LED lights, the resistance of the cell itself is usually the only current limiting device. The cell should not therefore be replaced with a lower resistance type, such as one using a different [[battery chemistry]].

Finally, LEDs can be run from a single cell by use of a constant current switched mode invertor. The extra expense makes this option unpopular.
