'''Coconut water''' is the clear liquid inside young coconuts (fruits of the [[coconut|coconut palm]]), not to be confused with [[coconut milk]].  As the fruit matures, the coconut water gradually is replaced by the [[Coconut#The fruit|coconut meat]] and air.  A very young coconut has very little meat, and the meat is very tender, almost a gel.  Coconut water has long been a popular drink in the [[tropics]], especially in Tropical [[Asia]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]], where it is available fresh or bottled. It is naturally fat-free and low in [[food energy]] (16.7 [[calorie]]s or 70 [[kilojoule]]s per 100 [[gram]]s).

Coconuts for drinking are carefully packaged and sold in many places.  These are typically Asian coconuts whose outer green husk has been removed, and the remainder wrapped in plastic. In Central America, particularly in [[Costa Rica]], it is found and sold in strategic highway stops or on the beaches; there, the coconut water is called "agua de pipa", and the coconut is cut in front of the customer to ensure its freshness.  Coconut water can also be found in regular cans or [[tetra Pak|tetra paks]] (and often has coconut pulp or [[Coconut#The_fruit|coconut jelly]] added) and is also marketed as a [[sports drink]] because of its high [[potassium]] and mineral content.

While people prefer different flavors of coconut water, generally a green coconut with some age spots tastes good. Coconuts from various parts of the world also differ in taste.  For example, [[India]]n coconuts tend to be salty and [[Brazil]]ian coconuts have a sweeter water and flesh.

== Harvesting ==

Fresh coconuts for drinking are typically harvested off the tree while they are green. A hole may be bored into the coconut to provide access to the liquid and meat. In young coconuts the liquid and air may be under some pressure and may spray slightly when the inner husk is first penetrated. Coconuts that have fallen to the ground are susceptible to rot and damage from insects or animals.
