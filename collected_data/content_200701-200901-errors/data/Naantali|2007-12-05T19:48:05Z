'''Naantali''' ({{IPA2|ˈnɑːntɑli}}) (Swedish ''Nådendal'') is a [[municipalities of Finland|city]] in south-western [[Finland]], known as one of the most important [[tourism|tourist]] centres of the country. The small city, with a population of 14,081 (as of 2007), is located in the [[regions of Finland|region]] of [[Finland Proper (region)|Finland Proper]], 15 kilometres west of [[Turku]].

The city encompasses a land area of 51.08 [[square kilometre]]s. Most of this area is located on the island of [[Luonnonmaa]] southwest of the city centre, but the majority of the population lives on the mainland. In fact, most of the island is beautiful forest and farmland, while the mainland consists chiefly of residential areas.

== History ==

One of the oldest cities in Finland, Naantali was founded around the mediaeval convent church that still dominates its skyline. The charter was signed by King [[Christopher of Bavaria|Christopher]] of [[Sweden]], the then ruler of Finland, in [[1443]]. The convent got trading rights and other privileges, and the town around it began to grow. It also became an important destination for [[pilgrimage]].

In the [[16th century]], as [[Catholicism]] gave way to [[Protestantism]] as the official religion of [[Finland]], the convent was closed, and the city plunged into a depression. This lasted until the mid-[[18th century]], when the city got a [[customs|tollgate]] and a customs chamber. In the two centuries of economic stagnation before that the city had become famous for its knitted [[stockings]], a craft carried on from the times of the convent.

The year [[1863]] saw the founding of the spa at Cape Kalevanniemi, which raised the city's status as a holiday venue. In [[1922]], the Kultaranta estate on [[Luonnonmaa]] was made the official summer residence for the President of the Republic, after Finland had gained its independence five years earlier.

The true prosperity of the city began in the 1950's, as the heavy industries that dominate the city's economy were established. In [[1964]], the area and population of the city increased markedly as the surrounding [[Naantalin maalaiskunta|rural municipality of Naantali]] (''Naantalin maalaiskunta'', which by now had a greater population than the city proper and thus was no longer rural) was annexed into it. Today, Naantali is the second richest city in Finland, and the richest in the province of [[Finland Proper]], measured by amounts of [[council tax]] paid per capita.

== Tourism and points of interest ==

This interesting divide between urban and rural is perhaps one reason as to why the city has been named the most popular tourist centre in the country in numerous surveys. Another factor affecting this is the proximity of both Turku, the region's administrative centre and largest city, and of the [[archipelago]].

There are some important points of interest in the city, such as the [[Moomin World]] theme park on the island of Kailo.

Naantali Spa Hotel, the largest spa in [[Scandinavia]], and the mediaeval [[convent]] [[church]] of Naantali. The city's popularity as a tourist venue is highlighted by the fact that the official summer residence of the [[President of Finland]], the [[Kultaranta]] estate, is located on Luonnonmaa.

The [[archipelago sea]] boat traffic is handled by [[S/S Ukkopekka]]. Old [[steamship]] cruise Naantali-[[Turku]]-Naantali.

Naantali hosts an international [[music festival]] every June, and the traditional Sleepyhead Day [[carnival]] in July.

== Other industries ==

In addition to tourism, the city's main industries are [[electricity]] production, [[oil refining]], [[manufacturing]], and [[Service Sector|services]]. The [[seaport]] of Naantali is the third largest in Finland in terms of goods traffic, and the city is home to a [[power plant]] and an oil refinery owned by the government-controlled company [[Fortum]].
