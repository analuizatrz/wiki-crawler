==Biography==
===Early life===
Westenra was born in [[Christchurch]], [[New Zealand]], the daughter of Jill and Gerald Westenra, with two siblings, Sophie and Isaac. She comes from a musically-inclined family; her grandmother (Shirely Ireland) was a singer, and her grandfather was a pianist and played the [[Accordion|piano-accordion]].<ref name=DVDLIVE1><u>Hayley Westenra: Live From New Zealand</u>. DVD. Universal Music, 2005. (UPC 044007430859)</ref>

Her musical career began at the age of six when she was cast in the role of "the Littlest Star" in her school's [[Christmas]] play, with a singing part. After the show, a teacher who had watched the performance, approached her parents and informed them that their daughter had [[absolute pitch|perfect pitch]].<ref name=DVDLIVE1><u>Hayley Westenra: Live From New Zealand</u>. DVD. Universal Music, 2005. (UPC 044007430859)</ref> The teacher encouraged Westenra to pick up a musical instrument to improve her abilities, and she began to take [[violin]] lessons. Along with the violin, she took up the piano and the recorder, and learned to read music by the age of seven. She began voice lessons and discovered a passion for musical theatre. By age 11, she had performed more than 40 times on stage.<ref name=DVDLIVE1><u>Hayley Westenra: Live From New Zealand</u>. DVD. Universal Music, 2005. (UPC 044007430859)</ref> Out of these performances, she remembers not always getting the parts she wanted, "...I got boy parts quite often. In ballet, there were not enough boys. So they ended up choosing half and half. I got chosen to wear the grey suit and the wig, and not the pretty dresses. In ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', I was [[Tiny Tim (A Christmas Carol)|Tiny Tim]], so I got to be quite a sick, sick boy. There was a severe lack of singing boys and, at the time, it was quite disappointing."<ref name=cbs_online_article_1>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/03/03/entertainment/main1367468.shtml |title=Hayley Westenra: Teen Angel |accessdate=2007-01-11 |format=HTML |work=CBS News }}</ref>

At the age of 12, Westenra entered a professional recording studio to record ''[[Walking in the Air (album)|Walking in the Air]]'', a demo album done for friends and family; only about 1000 copies were made. Some time later, after finishing her album, both Hayley and her sister, Sophie, [[busking|busked]] in the Christchurch streets.  The pair drew a large crowd, and one woman asked the girls if they had ever recorded anything. This woman turned out to be a journalist with [[Canterbury Television|CTV]], and asked Hayley to appear on air. A concert promotion company watched the show, and signed her to the [[Universal New Zealand]] Label. The concert promoter who saw her and was responsible for this deal was Gray Bartlett.<ref name=sexton_article>Sexton, Paul, and Christie Eliezer.

===International success===
Although her albums were quite successful in New Zealand, Westenra was unknown worldwide until she landed a contract with the [[Decca Music Group]] and recorded ''[[Pure (Hayley Westenra album)|Pure]]'', a CD of classical, light pop, and traditional [[Māori]] songs. [[Decca Music Group|Decca]]'s U.K. president was also impressed with her voice when they signed her to the label, he said that he was, "captivated by the beauty and expressiveness of her voice."<ref name=McNickel_article>McNickel, David. "Teen-age classics. (Global Music Pulse[TM])." Billboard 114.7 ([[February 16]], [[2002]]): 41(1). Expanded Academic ASAP. Thomson Gale. Susquehanna University. [[13 December]] [[2006]] .</ref> ''[[Pure (Hayley Westenra album)|Pure]]'' enjoyed record-topping success. It became the fastest-selling debut album in the history of the [[UK classical chart]]s. ''Pure'' sold 19,068 copies in its first week alone, flew to Number 1 on the [[UK classical chart]]s, and entered the [[UK Albums Chart|UK Pop Chart]] at #8.<ref name=sexton_article>Sexton, Paul, and Christie Eliezer.

[[13 December]] [[2006]] .</ref> To date, over two million copies of ''Pure'' have been sold. In New Zealand "Pure" has been certified 10x platinum, making her the best-selling artist (regardless of genre) in the country's history.<ref name=performingarts1>{{cite web |url=http://www.performingarts.ufl.edu/programs/Hayley%20Westenra.pdf |title=Teenage songstress Hayley Westenra brings gorgeous classical crossover music to the Phillips Center |accessdate=2006-03-22 |format=PDF }}</ref> This album ensured that [[Decca Music Group|Decca]], her record label, would take her seriously. When the facts are presented about her fame today, some of her fame can be directly attributed to the way in which [[Decca Music Group|Decca]] promoted her. Although the traditional audience of Classical Crossover Music is that of adult women, they also promoted her to children and teenagers.<ref name=hailing_distance_of_us>Tsioulcas, Anastasia.

[[Decca Music Group|Decca]] has also promoted her in other ways as well. In the US they promoted her by attempting to gain attention from the TV and film industries. She took her first acting role on Episode 46 (Charade) as a Singer in the Lair on the TV show ''[[American Dreams]]'' ([[NBC]]) where she played the [[guitar]] and sang "Who Painted the Moon Black?".<ref name=americandreams1>"Charade."

After releasing [[Pure (Hayley Westenra album)|Pure]], Westenra and her family moved to [[London, England]]. She continues to live in her own central London flat, even though her family subsequently returned home to [[Christchurch]]. Although she spent most of 2006 touring, she did her best to visit them when she could.<ref name=march_06_newsletter>{{cite web |url=http://www.hayleywestenra.com/newsletter/march_2006.html |title=March 2006 Newsletter |accessdate=2006-04-13 |format=HTML |work=Hayley Westenra Official Web Site }}</ref> Westenra was the 2004 Vodafone [[New Zealand Music Awards]] winner of "Highest Selling New Zealand Album" and "International Achievement Award"<ref name=vodafone1>{{cite web |url=http://www.nzmusicawards.co.nz/awards2004/winners.asp |title=2004 Vodafone Winners |format=HTML |work=Vodafone |accessdate=2005-08-03}} </ref> Although few artists receive any praise from their Prime Minister, Miss Westenra is one of the few who have. On 20 February, the Prime Minister [[Helen Clark]] awarded her for being the first New Zealand artist to receive the tenfold platinum status in the New Zealand market, where she held the number one artist position for 18 weeks.<ref name=sexton_article>Sexton, Paul, and Christie Eliezer.

Also in 2004 she began her world tour of [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], [[Japan]] and the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. At the [[Sydney Opera House]] she received a rare [[standing ovation]].  She concluded 2004 with a successful Christmas tour of the East Coast of the US as guest soloist with the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]].<ref name=officialsite_bio>{{cite web |url=http://www.hayleywestenra.com/hayley-westenra-biography.htm |title=Biography |accessdate=2006-12-13 |format=HTML |work=Hayley Westenra Official Web Site }}</ref>

In 2005, she released a new album called ''Odyssey'', titled for her journey to musical success. A mix of classical, pop, Celtic, and new age, she co-wrote and arranged some of the tracks on the album, which was released in the US on [[October 18]]. A more recent version of Odyssey was released in the United Kingdom on [[April 10]] [[2006]]. It has several new recordings not on the original album.<ref name=officalwebsite_music_and_video>{{cite web |url=http://www.hayleywestenra.com/westenra-music-video.htm |title=Music and Video |accessdate=2006-04-13 |format=HTML |work=Hayley Westenra Official Web Site }}</ref> Ending 2005, she made an appearance on [[Kurt Browning]]'s Gotta Skate, which aired on [[NBC]] on [[December 18]] and where she performed with [[Andrea Bocelli]].<ref name=skate1>"Kurt Browning's Gotta Skate: 2005."

[[Image:Hayley_Westenra.jpg|right|thumb|Hayley Westenra]]
She spent the first half of 2006 performing as a supporting act for the pop-opera quartet [[Il Divo]] on a worldwide tour, though in March she performed several solo concerts in the US as well.  That tour officially ended in June, but was then extended by six dates.  She then performed several concerts in the [[UK]] and [[Germany]] through the end of the summer.<ref name=officalwebsite_news>{{cite web |url=http://www.hayleywestenra.com/hayley-westenra-news.htm |title=News |accessdate=2006-04-13 |format=HTML |work=Hayley Westenra Official Web Site }}</ref> 

In August 2006, she joined [[Celtic Woman]], and is featured on their second major DVD/CD album, [[Celtic Woman - A New Journey]], which was released January 30, 2007 and immediately hit the Billboard Top 200 music chart at Number 4.<ref name=celtic_new_journey_billboard>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/chart_display.jsp?g=Albums&f=The+Billboard+200 |title=The Billboard 200 |accessdate=2007-02-15 |format=HTML |work=The Billboard }}</ref>


In addition to her Dutch surname,<ref name=times_article_1>Lee, Linda. "Almost a Diva." <u>New York Times</u> [[April 25]], [[2004]]: 9.4.</ref> her lineage is traced back to County Monaghan in Ireland prior to her family's emigration to New Zealand.<ref name=DVDLIVE1>Hayley Westenra: Live From New Zealand. DVD. Universal Music, 2005. (UPC 044007430859)</ref><ref name=celticwoman>{{cite web |url=http://www.celticwoman.com/viewSection.asp?idSection=203 |title=Celtic Woman News |accessdate=2006-12-13 |format=HTML |work=Official website of the [[Celtic Woman]] }}</ref> She will be touring with the group in the US in 2007, although specific details have yet to be released.<ref name=celticwoman>{{cite web |url=http://www.celticwoman.com/viewSection.asp?idSection=203 |title=Celtic Woman News |accessdate=2006-12-13 |format=HTML |work=Official website of the [[Celtic Woman]] }}</ref> On [[5 September]] [[2006]], Miss Westenra was named as one of the 10 outstanding young people in the world by the [[Junior Chamber International]]. Later in 13 November of the same year, she participated in the dedication of the New Zealand War Memorial in London.<ref name=officalwebsite_news>{{cite web |url=http://www.hayleywestenra.com/hayley-westenra-news.htm |title=News |accessdate=2006-04-13 |format=HTML |work=Hayley Westenra Official Web Site }}</ref> 

Although she has seen great success, many people note that Miss Westenra does not display any diva tendencies, as pointed out by Nandini D'Souza. According to D'Souza, this can possibly be attributed to the fact that her family has come along for many of the trips that she has been on so far. She also confirmed this herself by one time saying, "They keep an eye on me." where she was referring to her parents. <ref name=the_hayley_show_article>D'Souza, Nandini, and Venessa Lau.

February 26, 2007 will see the UK release of Hayley's third international album "Treasure". Tracks on this album, which has a celtic feel, will include E Pari Ra, One Fine Day, Let Me Lie, Danny Boy, Abide With Me and several others. Hayley has co-written four of the fifteen tracks, and the album also features singer Humphrey Berney. The US release will follow in March under the name "Celtic Treasure".<ref name=officialsite_main_Jan_07>{{cite web |url=http://www.hayleywestenra.com/ |title=Main Page |accessdate=2007-01-24 |format=HTML |work=Hayley Westenra Official Web Site }}</ref>

Hayley has dedicated the album to her "nanna", Shirley Ireland. Inside the sleeve of the UK edition, she wrote "I come from a musical family, and one with a real sense of history. My forefathers were on the maiden voyage from Ireland to Christchurch, New Zealand in 1850 - there's even a plaque in Cathedral Square, Christchurch, which bears the name Westenra to commemorate this. My grandmother used to sit me on her knee and sing songs like "Danny Boy" from as early as I can remember. A singer herself in her earlier years, she has always been a never-ending source of songs. It's this legacy of music that she's been passing down to me since my childhood, and it's many of these beautiful old songs that I've explored here on my album."

==Philanthropy and charity==
[[Image:Hayley_ghana.jpg|right|thumb|Hayley in [[Ghana]]]]
Westenra is the youngest [[UNICEF]] Ambassador to date. In 2005, Westenra visited [[Ghana]] to publicize her latest project and actively help funding for UNICEF; this involved raising money to purchase bicycles for young girls, allowing them to get to their schools from outlying surrounding areas. She has also been the ambassador for [[Save the Children]] in [[Hong Kong]]. More recently, she took part in a breast cancer awareness campaign in New Zealand.<ref name=officialsite_bio>{{cite web |url=http://www.hayleywestenra.com/hayley-westenra-biography.htm |title=Biography |accessdate=2006-12-13 |format=HTML |work=Hayley Westenra Official Web Site }}</ref> One of the other charities which she helps, is the Women's Environmental Network.<ref name=wen>{{cite web |url=http://www.wen.org.uk/ |title=Main Page |accessdate=2006-12-13 |format=HTML |work=Women's Environmental Network Web Site }}</ref> Another major charity which she helps is the Nordoff-Robbins Center for Music Therapy.
