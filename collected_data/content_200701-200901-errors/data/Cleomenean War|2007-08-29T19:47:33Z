The '''Cleomenean War'''<ref name="Polybius 2.46">[[#Polybius|Polybius]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+2.46 2.46]</ref> was fought between [[229 BC]] and [[222 BC]] between [[Sparta]] and their allies [[Elis]] against the [[Achean League]] and [[Macedon]]. The war ended in an Macedonian and Achean victory.

In [[235 BC]], Cleomenes ascended the throne of Sparta and starting reforms amongst them the restoration of the old Spartan discipline and trying to dispose of the [[ephors]]. Meanwhile the [[Achean League]] under [[Aratus of Sicyon]] started provoking Sparta by seizing lands of the [[Arcadian]] allies.

The ephors sent Cleomenes to seize a town on the border with [[Megapolis]]. In retaliation the Acheans declared war in [[229 BC]]. Cleomenes retaliated by ravaging Achean lands and defeating an army under Aratus which was sent to attack [[Elis]] at Mount Lycaeum. He followed up this victory with another victory near Megapolis. To gain complete control in Sparta he had the ephors killed.

In quick succession he cleared the cities of [[Arcadia]] of their Achean garrisons before crushing another Achean army at [[Battle of Dyme|Dyme]]. Facing Spartan domination of the League, Aratus was forced to turn to [[Antigonus III Doson]] of [[Macedon]] to help the Acheans defeat the Spartans. In return for their assistance, the Acheans had to surrender [[Acrocorinth]] to them. Cleomenes then invaded [[Achaea]] and took control of both [[Corinth]] and [[Argos]]. With Antigonus arrival in the Peloponnese, Cleomenes was forced to retreat to [[Laconia]]. Meeting the Acheans and the Macedons in battle, Cleomenes was routed at [[Battle of Sellasia|Sellasia]] and forced to seek refuge in [[Egypt]] at the court of his ally [[Ptolemy III]].
