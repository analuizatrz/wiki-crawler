'''Pennsylvania Route 39''' ('''PA 39''') is a west-east route that begins at North Front Street, [[Susquehanna Township, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Susquehanna Township]], and ends at [[U.S. Route 322|US 322]] and [[U.S. Route 422|US 422]] near [[Hummelstown, Pennsylvania|Hummelstown]] and [[Hershey, Pennsylvania|Hershey]].  It runs 17 miles and goes through [[Linglestown, Pennsylvania]].  PA 39 is one of the few state routes to end on a non-numbered road.  This exists because North Front Street is the decommissioned route for [[U.S. Route 22 (Pennsylvania)|US 22]]/US 322 (as well as [[U.S. Route 11|US 11]]/[[U.S. Route 15|US 15]]).  

From the western terminus to [[Interstate 81 (Pennsylvania)|Interstate 81]], PA 39 is known as '''Linglestown Road'''. Linglestown Road is mostly a two lane road runing  east and west through the northern portions of [[Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Dauphin County]]. 

From Interstate 81 to Hersheypark Drive, PA 39 is known as '''Hershey Road''', runing north and south although it has a east - west alignment. When becoming '''Hersheypark Drive''', PA 39 runs opposite to its alignment before reaching the eastern terminus.

PA 39 starts at North Front Street and ends at US 322 and US 422 near Hummelstown and Hershey.  There are two major sections of the road: Linglestown Road and Hershey Road, and one shorter section which is called Hersheypark Drive.  

Linglestown Road starts at North Front Street and ends at Jonestown Road in [[West Hanover Township, Pennsylvania|West Hanover Township]].  Hershey Road starts there, and ends at Hersheypark Drive and Park Boulevard, adjacent to [[Hersheypark]].  PA 39 turns south onto Hersheypark Drive, running to the terminus 1 mile south.  The road is heavily traveled, intersecting with several major local roads, one [[interstate highway]], [[Interstate 81]], as well as two U.S. Routes, US 22 and US 322.  22/322 runs concurrent from I-81 (only a mile south of PA 39) north to [[Williamsport, Pennsylvania|Williamsport]].<ref name=2004map/>  

[[Image:Linglestown Square.JPG|225px|thumb|left|The flagpole at the [[Linglestown, Pennsylvania|Linglestown]] square.]]
PA 39 passes through [[Linglestown, Pennsylvania|Linglestown]], which is a village that has a committee which is part of the governance of [[Lower Paxton Township, Pennsylvania|Lower Paxton Township]], which it is located in.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lowerpaxton-pa.gov/image/CPU_map.gif|title=Lower Paxton Community Planning Unit Map|format=gif|accessdate=2007-03-29|work=[[Lower Paxton Township, Pennsylvania|Lower Paxton Township]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lowerpaxton-pa.gov/government/town_manager.htm|title=Lower Paxton Township Manager|format=HTM|accessdate=2007-03-29|work=[[Lower Paxton Township, Pennsylvania|Lower Paxton Township]]}}</ref>  A unique feature to Linglestown is the flag pole that is located in the middle of the road at the intersection of Mountain Road and PA 39.  Since 1996, there have been a number of changes proposed, including moving the flag and replacing it with a traffic light.  In 2007, Lower Paxton Township approved a plan to improve PA 39 in Linglestown, and improve the local community.  Work will begin in Fall 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://linglestownpa.blogspot.com/2007/03/start-pushed-back-for-rt-39-square.html|title=Start pushed back for Rt. 39, square project|format=HTML|accessdate=2007-03-29|work=Linglestown Gazette - Blogspot.com}}</ref>  

Between Linglestown and Jonestown Road (a four mile stretch) is mostly wood and farm land, which is being more and more turned into residential or commercial land.  In 2005, [[Central Dauphin High School]] (one of two high schools of [[Central Dauphin School District]]) moved from its old location in Harrisburg to its current location on Piketown Road.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.publicschoolreview.com/school_ov/school_id/68790|title=Central Dauphin Sr. High School|accessdate=2007-03-29|format=HTML|work=Public School Review}}</ref>  Though a good distance away from PA 39, the school property starts at the corner of Linglestown and Piketown roads.

PA 39 intersects I-81 at Exit 77.  Truck stops were built around the exit, and the area is heavily utilized by trucks.  West Hanover Township plans to upgrade the interchange to incorporate traffic lights at both lanes of travel on and off of I-81, as well as traffic lights at the truck stops.

Linglestown Road ends at the intersection with Jonestown Road, only feet from the I-81 interchange.

Hershey Road was at one time mostly farm land, but since 2002, has become some what built up with many townhouses, villas, and houses.  Two large developments have been built with in 2 miles of each other, and one smaller development was built.  A shopping center, anchored by a supermarket was built in 2005.<ref name=2004map/>

PA 39 intersects Hersheypark Drive at the parking lot for [[Hersheypark]], as well as the [[Giant Center]].  PA 39 turns south, and ends at US 322 and US 422, in Hummelstown.<ref name=pamap/>

==History==
PA 39 was established in 1936, running from (what at the time was) US 11/US 15/US 22/US 322. Eventually, US 11/US 15 was moved to the west shore of the [[Susquehanna River]], and US 22/US 322 was moved a mile east, on a bypass highway.  PA 39 had a concurrency with [[Pennsylvania Route 894]] until 1946 when PA 894 was decommissioned. That concurrency ran from North Mountain Road to Piketown Road.<ref name="1926map">{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_PDF_FILES/Maps/Type_10_GHS_Historical_Scans/Dauphin_1926.pdf|title=1926 Dauphin County Map|format=PDF|work=PennDOT|accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref><ref name="1941map">{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_PDF_FILES/Maps/Type_10_GHS_Historical_Scans/Dauphin_1941.pdf|title=1941 Dauphin County Map|format=PDF|work=PennDOT|accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref> 

Between 1960 and 1964, PA 39 was extended to it's current terminus at US 322/US 422.  However, the original extension was commissioned on Hershey Road, which turned into Hanover Road as it approached Union Deposit.  After passing through Union Deposit, PA 39 turned south onto Hersheypark Drive and ran to US 322/US 422.  Between 1964 and 1970, Hershey Road was extended from North Hanover Road to Hersheypark Drive.  PA 39 was rerouted to bypass Union Deposit and give a more direct way to get to Hersheypark.  Park Boulevard, in Hershey, was also rerouted to meet at the intersection of Hersheypark Drive and Hershey Road.<ref name="1964map1">{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_PDF_FILES/Maps/Type_10_GHS_Historical_Scans/Dauphin_1964_Sheet_1.pdf|title=1964 Dauphin County Map (Sheet 1)|format=PDF|work=PennDOT|accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref><ref name="1964map2">{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_PDF_FILES/Maps/Type_10_GHS_Historical_Scans/Dauphin_1964_Sheet_2.pdf|title=1964 Dauphin County Map (Sheet 2)|format=PDF|work=PennDOT|accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref> 

In 1972 and 1973, PA 39 was widened from two to four lanes and included a median from North Front Street to Terrace Drive in Lucknow.  In 1992, a center lane was added from Terrace Drive in Lucknow, to the Lower Paxton/Susquehanna Township border.  In 1999 and 2000, that center lane was extended to one mile west of the Linglestown Square.<ref name="1974map1">{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_PDF_FILES/Maps/Type_10_GHS_Historical_Scans/Dauphin_1974_Sheet_1.pdf|title=1974 Dauphin County Map (Sheet 1)|format=PDF|work=PennDOT|accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref><ref name="1974map2">{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_PDF_FILES/Maps/Type_10_GHS_Historical_Scans/Dauphin_1974_Sheet_2.pdf|title=1974 Dauphin County Map (Sheet 2|format=PDF|work=PennDOT|accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref> 

In 1989, a median was installed between West Chocolate Avenue and the PA 39 terminus at US 322/US 422.<ref name="1990map">{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_PDF_FILES/Maps/Type_10_GHS_Historical_Scans/Dauphin_1990_Sheet_1.pdf|title=1990 Dauphin County Map (Sheet 1)|format=PDF|work=PennDOT|accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref> 

The intersection of Hershey Road and Hersheypark Drive was upgraded in 2002 when the [[Giant Center]] opened, the Hersheypark parking lot was renovated, and the main entrance of the parking lot was moved off Hersheypark Drive.<ref name="2004map">{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_PDF_FILES/Maps/Type_10_GHS_Historical_Scans/Dauphin_2004.pdf|title=2004 Dauphin County Map|format=PDF|work=PennDOT|accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref> 

==Current and future projects==
===Village of Linglestown===
Since 1996, the village has been considering making improvements to the village square.  At the center of the square, which happens to be in the middle of the road, is a flag pole.    The initial plan was to move the flag pole, and insert a traffic light. After long debate, that idea was shot down. It was replaced by the "Linglestown Plan". It was proposed on [[March 31]], [[2000]].  

Nearly seven years later, on [[February 20]], [[2007]], Lower Paxton Township approved a modified version of the Linglestown Action Plan, which involves the addition of roundabouts, other approaches to slowing down traffic through the square, and general community improvement.<ref name="news 1">{{cite news

===Other development along PA 39===
Plans are in development to build a new shopping center near the intersection of PA 39 and [[State Route 3015 (Dauphin County, Pennsylvania)|Progress Avenue]], which would be operated by [[Cedar Shopping Centers, Inc.|Cedar Shopping Centers]].  As a result, Susquehanna Township, is considering widening PA 39 from 22/322 to Progress Avenue.  Cedar Shopping Centers, Inc. already operates Oakhurst Plaza, which is about one mile east of Progress Avenue.<ref name="news 5">{{cite news

In January 2007, Lower Paxton Township installed a traffic light at the intersection with Patton Road.  The traffic light was installed at the request of a [[Commerce Bancorp|Commerce Bank]] going in at the corner of PA 39 and Patton Road, as well as a small shopping center, a doctor's office, and a [[Dunkin' Donuts]]/[[Baskin Robbins]].  The doctor's office opened in January 2007, and the Dunkin' Donuts opened in March 2007.  

West Hanover Township also plans on making improvements to the I-81 interchange with the truck stops on PA 39.  Currently, there is only one traffic light, which is at Jonestown Road.  West Hanover Township plans to install traffic lights and add additional lanes to accompany the increased truck traffic because of warehouses built in 2003 and 2004.  

The Hershey Road section of PA 39 is seeing the most development currently, as it was mostly farmland until 2002, when those lands were being bought and developed.  Meadows Marketplace (also owned by Cedar Shopping Centers) was built in 2005, and is anchored by a [[Giant Food of Carlisle, Pennsylvania|Giant Foods]].  Giant opened in October 2005, and the smaller shops in the shopping center are still being built.  Several other stores opened in July 2006, and the shopping center is reaching capacity as of 2007.<ref name="news 3">{{cite web

Four traffic lights were also installed in October 2005, two where Hershey Meadows housing development and Meadows Marketplace was built, one at Grand View Road (the major route to Hummelstown which goes through Hummelstown and the [[Hummelstown Bypass]]). The fourth light was installed at North Hanover Road, the route PA 39 once followed before being directed slightly north towards Hersheypark.

There was also once a plan to build an indoor waterpark approximately near North Hanover Street.  However, South Hanover Township effectively stopped the plan from moving forward because of concerns about traffic on PA 39.<ref name="news 6">{{cite news
