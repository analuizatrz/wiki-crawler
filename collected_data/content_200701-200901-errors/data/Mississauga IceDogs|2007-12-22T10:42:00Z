The '''Mississauga IceDogs''' are a former [[junior ice hockey]] team in [[Mississauga, Ontario|Mississauga]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. They played in the [[Ontario Hockey League]] from 1998 to 2007. A sale relocated the team to [[St. Catharines, Ontario]] for the [[2007-08 OHL season|2007-08 season]] and are now called the [[Niagara IceDogs]]. [http://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/webapp/sitepages/content.asp?contentid=499733&catname=Local+News&classif=]

==History==
From 1998 to 2002, the IceDogs enjoyed little success, finishing last in the [[Ontario Hockey League|OHL]]'s Central Division every year. During this building phase, the team had six head coaches within the span of 4 years, including the owner, [[Don Cherry (ice hockey)|Don Cherry]]. Mississauga drafted first overall each year, leading to two rookies of the year, including one of the highest touted NHL prospects in [[Jason Spezza]].

In the [[2002-03 OHL season]], the IceDogs finished fourth in the Central division and made the playoffs for the first time in franchise history, but lost in the first round in five games against the [[Ottawa 67's]]. 

The [[2003-04 OHL season]] was the IceDogs' best season. The team finished second in the Central division, finishing two points behind the division champion [[St. Michael's Majors]], and third overall in the Eastern Conference. 

In the first round of the playoffs, the IceDogs defeated the [[Oshawa Generals]] in seven games, winning their first-ever playoff series. The IceDogs were down three games to two against the [[Barrie Colts]] in the second round but managed to come back and win the series in seven games. The surprise IceDogs then upset the [[St. Michael's Majors]] in the Eastern Conference Championship series in six games to win the [[Bobby Orr Trophy]] and earn their first-ever trip to the Ontario Hockey League finals. The dream ended there as they fell to the [[Guelph Storm]] in four straight games in the [[Ontario Hockey League|OHL]] final, losing the fourth game at the [[Hershey Centre]]. 

[[2004-05 OHL season|2004-05]] was another record setting season for the IceDogs. They won their first ever central division title and finished first in the Eastern Conference with 81 points. Despite regular season success, the IceDogs were upset in the first round of the playoffs by the eighth-seeded Toronto [[St. Michael's Majors]] in five games. In [[2005-06 OHL season|2005-06]] the IceDogs started rebuilding and missed the playoffs again. 

===Change in ownership===
On [[July 12]], [[2006]], [[Eugene Melnyk]], owner of the [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]], bought the Mississauga IceDogs. After the 2006-07 season, Melnyk sold the IceDogs, and moved the Majors to the [[Hershey Centre]] in Mississauga. [http://www.stmichaelsmajors.com/news/?id=1107]. On [[January 8]], [[2007]], Toronto businessman [[Tom Bitove]] proposed to buy the team with plans to move to [[Niagara Falls, Ontario|Niagara Falls]] [http://www.mississauga.com/mi/sports/story/3836022p-4438674c.html], but city council declined the proposal to build a new arena. [http://www.nugget.ca/webapp/sitepages/content.asp?contentid=371996&catname=Local%20Sports&classif=Sports%20-%20Local]  As an alternative, the team has approached the City of [[St. Catharines, Ontario|St. Catharines]] about moving the team into [[Jack Gatecliff Arena]] in the downtown core of the city. [[St. Catharines City Council]] voted on a leasing arrangement on April 23rd, 2007, which passed. Bill Burke bought the IceDogs and relocated the team to St. Catharines in time for the 2007-08 season, to be known as the '''Niagara IceDogs'''.  [http://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/webapp/sitepages/content.asp?contentid=499733&catname=Local+News&classif=] The IceDogs played their final game in Mississauga, on April 1, 2007, losing in game five of the Eastern Conference quarterfinas at home to the [[Sudbury Wolves]].

==Coaches==
Former team owner, and legendary hockey commentator [[Don Cherry (ice hockey)|Donald S.

The team had its best season to the date, but still failed to reach the playoffs. The IceDogs were one of the highest-selling road teams in the OHL that year, as many spectators attended games to see Don Cherry coach and seek autographs.

==Uniforms & Logos==
[[Image:MississaugaIceDogsOldLogo.jpg|right|80px]]
The IceDogs colours are red, white, black and silver. The logo is styled after [[Don Cherry (ice hockey)|Don Cherry's]] pet bull terrier named Blue. It shows a snarling dog overtop of the IceDogs name with a maple leaf in the background. The original logo (inset right) looked a roboticized dog with red eyes in front of a big letter "M" with a maple leaf in the corner. The logo was redesigned after their 5th season with the change in ownership.

==Arena==
The Mississauga IceDogs play home games at the [[Hershey Centre]] in northeast Mississauga, near the junction of [[Highway 401 (Ontario)|Highway 401]] & [[Highway 403 (Ontario)|Highway 403]]. The Hershey Centre hosted the [[Ontario Hockey League history#All-Star Games|OHL All-Star Game]] in 2000.
