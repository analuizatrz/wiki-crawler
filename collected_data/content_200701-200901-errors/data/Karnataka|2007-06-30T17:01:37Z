'''Karnātakā''' {{audio|Karnataka.ogg|pronunciation}} ([[Kannada language|Kannada]]: ಕನಾ೯ಟಕ) ({{IPA2|kəɹnɑːʈəkɑː}}) is one of the four [[South India|southern]] [[States and territories of India|state]]s of [[India]].  The state was [[Unification of Karnataka |created]] in 1956 with the passing of the [[States Reorganisation Act]].  Originally named ''[[Mysore state|state of Mysore]]'', it was renamed as ''Karnataka'' in 1973.  It is bordered by the [[Arabian Sea]] to the west, [[Goa]] to the northwest, [[Maharashtra]] to the  north, [[Andhra Pradesh]] to the east, [[Tamil Nadu]] to the southeast, and [[Kerala]] to the southwest. The state covers an area of 1,91,791 km² or 5.83% of the total geographical area of India.  It is the [[List of states of India by area |8th largest Indian state by area]], [[List of states of India by population |the 9th largest by population]] and comprises of 27 [[Districts of India |districts]].  [[Kannada language|Kannada]] is the official and the most widely spoken language in the state.

[[Origin of Karnataka's name|Several etymologies]] have been suggested for the name Karnataka. One accepted derivative comes from the Kannada words ''karu'' and ''nādu'' meaning ''elevated land''. ''Karu nadu'' may also be read as ''Karu'' (black) and ''nadu'' (region); as a reference to the [[black soil|black cotton soil]] found in the [[Bayalu Seeme]] region of Karnataka. During the [[British Raj]], the word ''Carnatic'' or ''Karnatak'' was used to describe this part of the region in general. With an ancient and rich history that goes back to the [[paleolithic]] hand-axe culture, some of the most powerful empires of ancient India called this region home. Great philosophers and musical bards belonging to Karnataka launched socio-religious movements whose ennobling effects have been felt far and wide. Karnataka is the only state in India that boasts of significant contribution to both forms of Indian classical music, the [[Carnatic music]] and [[Hindustani music]] traditions. Kannada language has received the highest number of [[Jnanpith|Jnanpith awards]] in India.  [[Bengaluru]], popularly known as the ''Garden city of India'' is today at the forefront of the rapid economic and technological development that India is experiencing.

==History==
[[Image:Belur4.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hoysala Empire]] architecture in [[Belur]]]]
{{main|History of Karnataka|Political history of medieval Karnataka|Origin of Karnataka's name}}
The history of Karnataka goes back to [[paleolithic]] hand-axe culture; evidences of which are the discoveries of hand axes and cleavers in the region. [[Neolithic]] sites have been discovered which indicate that people had domesticated animals, used copper and bronze weapons, wore bangles, rings, necklaces of beads and ear-rings and had burial chambers. During the [[megalithic]] age, long swords, sickles, axes, hammers, spikes, chisels and arrows, all made of iron came into use. Gold discovered in [[Harappa]] was found to be imported from mines in Karnataka, prompting scholars to hypothesize that there existed contacts between ancient Karnataka and the [[Indus valley civilization]] in 3000 BCE.

Prior to third century BCE, most of Karnataka was part of the [[Nanda Empire]], later coming under the [[Mauryan empire]] of [[Emperor Ashoka]]. Around 230 BCE, large areas of Karnataka region came under the [[Satavahana dynasty]] and remained so for nearly four centuries. The disintegration of the Satavahanas led to the ascent of the earliest native kingdoms, the [[Kadambas]] and the [[Western Gangas]], marking the birth of the region as an independent political entity. [[Kadamba Dynasty]] was founded by [[Mayurasharma]] with the capital at [[Banavasi]] and [[Western Ganga Dynasty]] was formed with [[Talakad]] as its capital. [[Image:Ugranarasimha statue at Hampi dtv.JPG|thumb|Statue of Ugranarasimha at [[Hampi]]]]These were the first kingdoms to give administrative status to Kannada language; the evidence of which is the [[Halmidi inscription]] of 450 CE and discovery of a 5th century copper coin at Banavasi with Kannada inscription on it. These dynasties were followed by imperial Kannada empires such as the [[Badami Chalukyas]], the [[Rashtrakuta Dynasty|Rashtrakuta empire of Manyakheta]] and the [[Western Chalukya Empire]], who had their regal capitals in modern Karnataka region and ruled over large parts of the [[Deccan]].

The turn of the first millennium saw the [[Hoysalas]] rise to power in Karnataka. Art and architecture flourished in the region during this time resulting in distinctive Kannada [[Meter_(music)|literary metres]] and the construction of temples and sculptures adhering to the [[Hoysala architecture |Vesara style of architecture]]. The expansion of Hoysala Empire brought parts of modern Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu under their rule. In the early 14th century, [[Harihara]] and [[Bukka Raya]], established the [[Vijayanagara empire]] with its capital at ''Hosapattana'' (later called as [[Vijayanagara]]) on the banks of Tungabhadra river in modern Bellary district. This empire rose as a bulwark against the Muslim invasions into the South and held sway over entire southern India for well over 200 years. 

In 1565, a major geopolitical shift in the history of Karnataka and south India took place when the Vijayanagara empire fell to a confederation of the sultanates in the [[Battle of Talikota]]. The [[Bijapur Sultanate]], which had risen after the demise of the [[Bahmani Sultanate]] of Bidar, now rose as the main power in the Deccan until they were defeated by the [[Moghul empire|Moghuls]] in late 17th century. The Bahamani and Bijapur rulers encouraged Urdu and Persian literature and Indo-Saracenic architecture, the Gol Gumbaz being one of the high points of this contribution. The period that followed saw northern parts of Karnataka being ruled by different powers such as the Marathas, the Nizam of Hyderabad etc.  
[[Image:GolGumbaz2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gol Gumbaz]] at [[Bijapur]]]]
In the south, the [[Wodeyar|Mysore Wodeyars]], former [[vassal]]s of Vijayanagara Empire enjoyed independence for a brief period. With the death of [[Krishnaraja Wodeyar II]], [[Haidar Ali]] the commander-in-chief of the Mysore army assumed control over the region. After his death, the kingdom was passed on to his illustrious son [[Tipu Sultan]]. To contain the European expansion in south India, Tipu Sultan fought four significant [[Anglo-Mysore wars]], the last of which resulted in his death and the incorporation of Mysore into the [[British Raj]] in 1799. The Mysore kingdom was restored to the Wodeyars and Mysore remained a princely state under the British Raj.

After independence, the Maharaja, [[Jayachamarajendra Wodeyar]] acceded his kingdom to India. In 1950, Mysore became an Indian state of the same name and the former Maharaja became its ''Rajpramukh'' (head of state), until 1975. The [[Unification of Karnataka |Ekikarana movement]] which started in the late 19th century, culminated in the formation of Karnataka state in 1956, nine years after independence. With the implementation of The States Reorganization Act of 1956, Kodagu and parts of Madras, Hyderabad and Bombay states were incorporated into the state of Mysore. The state of Mysore was formed on November 1, 1956 which was later renamed as Karnataka in [[1973]].

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Karnataka}}
The state has three principal geographical zones; coastal [[Karavali]], [[Malnad]] comprising of [[Western Ghats]] and [[Bayaluseeme]] comprising of the plains of [[Deccan plateau]]. The bulk of the state is in the Bayaluseeme region, the northern part of which is second largest arid region in [[India]].<ref name="arid"> {{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1817/18170420.htm|author=Parvathi Menon|title=Karnataka's agony|work=Online Edition of the Frontline, Volume 18 - Issue 17, Aug. 18 - 31, 2001|publisher=© 2001, Frontline|accessdate=2007-05-04}}</ref> The highest point in Karnataka is [[Mullayanagiri]] hills in [[Chikkamagaluru district]] which has an altitude of {{convert|1929|m|ft|0|lk=on}}. Some of the important rivers in Karnataka are [[Kaveri]], [[Tungabhadra]], [[Krishna river|Krishna]] and [[Sharavathi]].

Karnataka consists of four main types of geological formations <ref name="geology">{{cite web|url=http://wgbis.ces.iisc.ernet.in/energy/paper/TR109/TR109_TVR.pdf|author=Ramachandra T.V. and Kamakshi G.|title=Bioresource Potential of Karnataka|work=Technical Report No. 109, November 2005|publisher=Centre for Ecological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore|accessdate=2007-05-05}}</ref> — the ''[[Archean]] complex'' made up of [[Dharwad]] [[schist]]s and granitic [[gneiss]]es, the ''[[Proterozoic]]'' non-fossiliferous sedimentary formations of the Kaladgi and Bhima series, the ''Deccan trappean and intertrappean deposits'' and the tertiary and recent laterites and alluvial deposits.  Significantly, about 60% of the state is comprised of the ''[[Archean]] complex'' which consist of gneisses, granites and charnockite rocks.  Laterite capping that are found in many districts over [[Deccan Traps]] were formed after the cessation of volcanic activity in the early tertiary period. Eleven groups of soil orders are found in Karnataka viz. [[Entisol]]s, [[Inceptisols]], [[Mollisol]]s, [[Spodosol]]s, [[Alfisol]]s, [[Ultisol]]s, [[Oxisol]]s, [[Aridisol]]s, [[Vertisol]]s, [[Andisol]]s and [[Histosol]]s.<ref name="geology"/> Depending on the agricultural capability of the soil, the soil types are divided into six types viz., Red, [[Lateritic soil|lateritic]], [[Black soil|black]], alluvio-colluvial, forest and coastal soils.

===Climate===
:''[[Rainfall in Karnataka]]''
Karnataka experiences four seasons. The winter in January and February is followed by summer between March and May, the monsoon season between June and September and the post-monsoon season from October till December. Meteorologically, Karnataka is divided into three zones — coastal, north interior and south interior. Of these, coastal zone receives the heaviest rainfall with an average rainfall of about {{convert|3638.5|mm|in|abbr=on|lk=on|0}} per annum far in excess of the state average of {{convert|1139|mm|in|abbr=on|0}}. [[Agumbe]] in [[Shivamogga district]] receives second highest annual rainfall in India.<ref name="second"> Agumbe receiving the second highest rainfall in India is mentioned by {{cite web|url=http://www.centralchronicle.com/20070328/2803302.htm|title=Link Godavari, Krishna & Cauvery|author=Arabinda Ghose|work=Online Edition of the Central Chronicle, dated 2007-03-28|publisher=2007, Central Chronicle|accessdate=2007-05-16}}</ref> The highest recorded temperature was {{convert|45.6|°C|°F|abbr=on|lk=on|0}} at [[Raichur]] and the lowest recorded temperature was {{convert|2.8|°C|°F|abbr=on|0}} C at [[Bidar]].

About 38,724 km² (or 20% of Karnataka's geographic) are covered by forests. The forests are classified as reserved, protected, unclosed, village and private forests. The percentage of forest area to Geographical area in the State is less than all-India average of about 23%, and 33% prescribed in the National Forest Policy.

Even though health care in Karnataka's private sector is among world's best<ref name="healthcare"/>, state as a whole has not been fully successful in providing effective primary health care. Apart from capital Bangalore and coastal districts of Udupi and Dakshina Kannada other parts of the state especially northern districts have not received sufficient attention by government and private sectors. However Karnataka has established a modicum of public health services having a better record of health care and child care compared to other states of India.<ref name="childcare">{{cite web|url=http://www.educationworldonline.net/eduworld/article.php?choice=prev_art&article_id=336&issueid=28|title= Ticking child healthcare time bomb|work=Online Webpage of the Education World|publisher=Education World|accessdate=2007-06-21}}</ref> The state has a birth rate of 2.2%, death rate of 0.72%, an infant mortality rate of 5.5%, a maternal mortality rate of 0.195% and 2.2 being [[total fertility rate]].

The [[Government of Karnataka]] is a [[democratic]]ally elected body with the [[Governor]] appointed for five years as the constitutional head. The governor appoints the [[List_of_Chief_Ministers_of_Karnataka|Chief Minister]] and his council of ministers in whom a great deal of legislative power is vested. Karnataka State has been divided into four revenue divisions, 49 sub-divisions, 27 districts, 175 taluks and 745 hoblies/Revenue Circles for administrative purposes.

The State legislature consists of the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council. The Legislative Assembly consists of 224 members who are elected for five year terms. The Legislative Council is a permanent body which consists of 75 members with one-third of its members retiring every two years. The citizens of Karnataka elect 28 members to the [[Lok Sabha]], the lower house of the Indian Parliament.<ref name="loksabha">{{cite web|url=http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/intro/introls.htm|title=Lok Sabha-Introduction|work=Online webpage of the Indian Parliament|publisher=Govt. of India|accessdate=2007-06-04}}</ref> 

The Executive arm of the Government is headed by [[Deputy Commissioner (India)|Deputy commissioners]] who belong to the [[Indian Administrative Service]] in each of the 27 districts. The deputy commissioner is assisted by a number of officers belonging to Karnataka state services. [[Superintendent of Police (India)|Deputy Commisioner of Police]], an officer belonging to the [[Indian Police Service]] is entrusted with the responsibility of maintaining law and order and related issues of the district. He in turn is assisted by the officers of the Karnataka Police Service. Apart from them, a [[Deputy Conservator of Forests (India)|Deputy Conservator of Forests]], an officer belonging to the [[Indian Forest Service]] also serves the government. Sectoral development is looked after by the district head of each development department such as PWD, Health, Education, Agriculture, Animal husbandry, etc. The judiciary is headquartered in Bangalore at the ''Attara Kacheri'' with courts in every district centers and some taluk centers. 

Politics in Karnataka is dominated by three major parties, [[Indian National Congress]], [[Janata Dal (Secular)]] and [[Bharatiya Janata Party]].<ref name="politics">{{cite web|url=http://www.ourkarnataka.com/Articles/starofmysore/karnatakapolitics1.htm|title=Karnataka Politics - Suspense till January 27|work=Online webpage of OurKarnataka.com|publisher=OurKarnataka.Com,Inc.|accessdate=2007-06-04}}</ref> Politicians from Karnataka have played prominent roles in Indian Government with some of them holding high positions of prime minister and vice president.

Karnataka is one of the economically more progressive states in India with a GSDP (Gross State Domestic Product) that grew at 9.2% in the year 2006-2007.<ref name="gsdp">{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/03/16/stories/2007031622370100.htm|title= GSDP registers 9.2 per cent growth|work=Online webpage of the Hindu, dated 2007-03-16|publisher=2007, The Hindu|accessdate=2007-06-11}}</ref> The total GSDP of Karnataka in 2006-2007 is about Rs. 1940.09 billion ($ 46.19 billion). With an overall GDP growth of 56.2% and a [[per capita GDP]] growth of 43.9% in the last decade, Karnataka surpassed all other states in India in terms of economic growth and pushed Karnataka's per capita income in Indian Rupee terms to sixth place. Till September 2006, Karnataka had received a [[Foreign Direct Investment]] of Rs. 78.097 billion ($ 1.7255 billion) for fiscal year 2006-07 placing it in the third spot among states in India. At the end of 2004 unemployment rate of Karnataka was 4.94% compared to national rate of 5.99%. For the fiscal year 2006-07 inflation rate of Karnataka was 4.4% which was less than the national average. 

Like much of the rest of the country, the economy is primarily agrarian and employs nearly 56% of the labor workforce. A total of 12.31 million hectares of land is cultivated in the state constituting 64.6% of the total geographical area. Much of this is dependent on the [[southwest monsoon]] as only 26.5% of the sown area is under irrigation. 

Karnataka evolved as the manufacturing hub for some of the largest [[public sector]] industries of India such as [[Hindustan Aeronautics Limited]], [[National Aerospace Laboratories]], [[Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited]], Indian Telephone Industries, [[Bharat Earth Movers Limited]], [[Hindustan Machine Tools]] and [[Hindustan Motors]] which are based in Bangalore. [[Indian Space Research Organization]] India's national [[space agency]] is also headquartered in Bangalore.

Starting from the 1980s, Karnataka has emerged as the information technology capital of the country.<ref name="business">{{cite web|url=http://www.indiainbusiness.nic.in/know-india/states/karnataka.htm|work=Ministry of External affairs|title=India in Business|publisher=© Government of India|accessdate=2007-06-11}}</ref> A total of 1973 companies in Karnataka are involved in Information Technology related business including big firms like [[Infosys]] and [[Wipro]]. IT exports from Karnataka amounting to excess of Rupees 50,000 crores ($12.5 billion) in the year 2006-2007 accounted for nearly 38% of the entire IT exports from India. This achievement has earned Bangalore the sobriquet of ''[[Silicon Valley of India]]''. Karnataka has also been at the forefront of the rapid strides that India has been making in biotechnology, a relatively new and fledgling industry in India.  Karnataka has India's largest biocluster having 158 of the total 320 biotechnological companies in India. The state also accounts for 75% of India's floriculture, an up and coming industry which supplies flowers and ornamental plants worldwide.<ref name="flower">{{cite web|url=http://www.karnataka.com/industry/floriculture/|work=OneIndia News, 12th June 2007|title=Floriculture|publisher=www.Karnataka.com|accessdate=2007-06-12}}</ref>

Seven of the country's leading banks, [[Canara Bank]], [[Syndicate Bank]], [[Corporation Bank]], [[Vijaya Bank]], [[Karnataka Bank]], [[Vysya Bank]] and the [[State Bank of Mysore]] originated from this state. Coastal districts of Udupi and Dakshina Kannada have a branch for every 500 persons - best distribution of banks in India.<ref name="fl">{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2015/stories/20030801002810400.htm|work=Online Edition of the Frontline, Volume 20 - Issue 15, July 19 - August 01, 2003|title=A pioneer's progress|author=Ravi Sharma|publisher=© 2003, Frontline|accessdate=2007-06-21}}</ref> As of March 2002, Karnataka had 4767 branches of different banks with each branch serving 11,000 persons which is less than the national average of 16,000.

{{main|Religion in Karnataka|Haridasa|Virashaiva}}
Karnataka has played a very important role in shaping present day Indian religion and philosophy.  The three most important schools of Vaishnava Hindu philosophy, ''[[Advaita]]'',''[[Vishistadvaita]]'' and ''[[Dvaita]]'' blossomed in Karnataka.  While [[Madhvacharya]] was born in Karnataka, [[Adi Shankaracharya]] chose [[Sringeri]] in Karnataka to establish the first of his four ''mathas''.

He first lived in Tondanur and then moved to Melkote where the Cheluvanarayana temple and a well organised [[Matha]] were built. He was patronized by Hoysala Vishnuvardhana, (Kamath 2001), p150-152</ref>  [[Udupi]], [[Sringeri]], [[Gokarna]] and [[Melkote]] are well known places of [[Sanskrit]] and [[Veda|Vedic]] learning. In the 12th century, [[Veerashaivism]] emerged in northern Karnataka as a protest against the rigidity of the prevailing social and caste system.  Leading figures of the movement such as [[Basava]], [[Akka Mahadevi]] and [[Allama Prabhu]] established the [[Anubhava Mantapa]] where the philosophy of ''Shakti Vishishtadvaita'' was expounded.  This was to form the basis of the [[Lingayat]] faith and today counts millions among its followers.<ref name="basa">Kamath (2001), p152-154</ref>   

The [[Jainism|Jaina]] faith had a stronghold in Karnataka in the early medieval period with [[Shravanabelagola]] as its most important center.  [[Rishabhadeva]] is said to have spent his final days in Karnataka.  Both Jain philosophy and literature have contributed immensely to the religious and cultural landscape of Karnataka. [[Shravanabelagola]], [[Mudabidri]] and [[Karkala]] are famous for Jain history and monuments. [[Islam]], which had a early presence in the west coast of India as early as the 10th century gained a foothold in Karnataka with the arrival of the Bahamani Sultans and Bijapur Sultanate who ruled parts of Karnataka.<ref name="bam">Sastri (1955), p396</ref>  [[Christianity]] reached Karnataka in the 16th century with the arrival of the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and St. Francis Xavier in 1545.<ref name="chris">Sastri (1955), p398</ref>  Today, both Islam and Christianity have a sizable following in the state and have contributed richly to the cultural cosmopolitanism of the state.  Buddhism was once popular in Karnataka during the first Millennium in places such as Gulbarga and Banavasi. A chance discovery of edicts and several Mauryan relics at Sannati in [[Gulbarga district]] in 1986 has proven that the Krishna river basin was once home to both [[Mahayana]] and [[Hinayana]] Buddhism.
