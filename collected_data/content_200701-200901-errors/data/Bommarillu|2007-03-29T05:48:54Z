== Plot ==
{{spoiler}}
Siddhu ([[Siddharth Narayan]]) is a well-disciplined young man - that's how his parents see him. Siddhu's father Aravind ([[Prakash Raj]]) makes every decision for him. From what he eats to whatever he wears. Siddhu accepts his father's choices merely to please him. However, Siddhu secretly decides to take control of choosing two things in his life, his  future spouse and his career. However, Siddhu soon becomes engaged to another girl (Neha). While complaining to his friends about his circumstance, he accidentally bumps his head against another girl's. When Siddhu says sorry, the girl calls him back and says "Sorry Chepte naaku kommulu raava?". Thus enters the talkative and bubbly Hasini([[Genelia D'Souza]]) into Siddhu's life. Hasini is a girl who does whatever she likes. She easily trusts people and that is how Siddhu enters her life. They start hanging out and start falling in love. The minute Siddhu starts yelling "I LOVE YOU", Aravind appears out of nowhere. A family meeting is arranged where it is decided Hasini will live the family for seven days and if she is accepted by the family members, Siddu may marry her. During those seven days, Siddhu's family learns more about Siddhu than about Hasini. They learn about his drinking, his leaving the house at night and about his opinion on the family. After the seventh day, as Aravind is about inform him his decision, Hasini interrupts by saying that she doesn't want Siddhu anymore. She explains by saying that Siddhu is very different from how he was when she first met him. She says that she acts the same way whether she is home or outdoors, unlike Siddhu. And that she doesn't know how to pretend as something else like Siddhu's family does. In the end the family is outside Hasini's house begging for her to marry Siddhu, which she does. But Hasini's father Kanaka Rao (Kota Srinivas Rao) doesn't want Siddu to marry Hasini because of a previous encounter between them where Siddhu curses his dad when he is drunk. So Kanaka Rao is afraid that Siddu won't show respect to Hasini. Aravind intervenes and declares that Siddu must stay in Hasini's house for a week to prove his character to Kanaka Rao.
