}}The '''Milky Way''' (a translation of the [[Latin]] ''Via Lactea'', in turn derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''Γαλαξίας'' (Galaxias) sometimes referred to simply as "[[Galaxy#Etymology|the Galaxy]]"), is a [[barred spiral galaxy|barred spiral]] [[galaxy]] that is part of the [[Local Group]] of galaxies.  Although the Milky Way is one of billions of galaxies in the [[observable universe]],<ref>Between 1{{e|10}} and 8{{e|10}}</ref> the Galaxy has special significance to humanity as it is the home galaxy of the planet [[Earth]]. The plane of the Milky Way galaxy is visible from Earth as a band of light in the night sky, and it is the appearance of this band of light which has inspired the name for our galaxy.

Some sources hold that, strictly speaking, the term ''Milky Way'' should refer exclusively to the observation of the band of light, while the full name ''Milky Way Galaxy'', or alternatively ''the Galaxy'' should be used to describe our galaxy as an astrophysical whole.<ref>

==View from Earth==

The Milky Way galaxy, as viewed from the [[Earth]], itself situated on one of the spiral arms of the galaxy (see [[Milky Way#Sun's location|Sun's location]]), appears as a hazy band of [[white]] [[light]] in the night sky arching across the entire [[celestial sphere]] originating from [[star]]s and other material which lie within the galactic plane. The plane of the Milky Way is inclined by about 60° to the [[ecliptic]] (the plane of the earth's orbit), with the [[North Galactic Pole]] situated at [[right ascension]] 12h49m, [[declination]] +27.4° ([[B1950]]) near [[beta Comae Berenices]]. The [[South Galactic Pole]] is near [[alpha Sculptoris]].

The centre of the galaxy is in the direction of [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], and the Milky Way then "passes" (going westward) through [[Scorpius]], [[Ara (constellation)|Ara]], [[Norma (constellation)|Norma]], [[Triangulum Australe]], [[Circinus]], [[Centaurus]], [[Musca]], [[Crux]], [[Carina (constellation)|Carina]], [[Vela (constellation)|Vela]], [[Puppis]], [[Canis Major]], [[Monoceros]], [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] & [[Gemini (constellation)|Gemini]], [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurua]], [[Auriga (constellation)|Auriga]], [[Perseus (constellation)|Perseus]], [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]], [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]], [[Cepheus (constellation)|Cepheus]] & [[Lacerta]], [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]], [[Vulpecula]], [[Sagitta]], [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]], [[Ophiuchus]], [[Scutum]], and back to [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]].
 
The Milky Way looks brightest in the direction of the [[constellation]] of [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], toward the [[galactic center]]. Relative to the [[celestial equator]], it passes as far north as the constellation of [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]] and as far south as the constellation of [[Crux]], indicating the high inclination of Earth's [[equator|equatorial plane]] and the plane of the [[ecliptic]] relative to the galactic plane. The fact that the Milky Way divides the night sky into two roughly equal [[celestial sphere|hemispheres]] indicates that our Solar System lies close to the [[galactic plane]]. The Milky Way has a relatively low [[surface brightness]], making it difficult to see from any [[Urban area|urban]] or [[suburban]] location suffering from [[light pollution]].

==Age==
[[Image:Perseid Meteor.jpg|thumb|A green and red [[Perseids|Perseid]] meteor is striking the sky just below the Milky Way in August 2007.]]
{{main|Galaxy formation and evolution|nucleocosmochronology}}
It is extremely difficult to define the age at which the Milky Way formed, but the age of [[HE 1523-0901|the oldest star in the Galaxy]] yet discovered is estimated to be about 13.2 billion years, nearly as [[Age of the universe|old as the Universe]] itself.

This estimate is based on research by a team of astronomers in 2004 using the UV-Visual Echelle Spectrograph of the [[Very Large Telescope]] to [[Measurement|measure]], for the first time, the [[beryllium]] content of two stars in [[globular cluster]] [[NGC 6397]]. <ref name=Eduardo04>Eduardo F. del Peloso a1a, Licio da Silva a1, Gustavo F. Porto de Mello and Lilia I. Arany-Prado (2005),
"The age of the Galactic thin disk from Th/Eu nucleocosmochronology: extended sample" (Proceedings of the International Astronomical Union (2005), 1: 485–486 Cambridge University Press)</ref>.  From this research, the elapsed time between the rise of the first generation of stars in the entire Galaxy and the first generation of stars in the cluster was deduced to be 200 million to 300 million years. By including the estimated age of the stars in the globular cluster (13.4 ± 0.8 billion years), they estimated the age of the oldest stars in the Milky Way at 13.6 ± 0.8 billion years.  Based upon this emerging science, the Galactic thin disk is estimated to have been formed between 6.5 and 10.1 billion years ago.

The Galaxy's bar is thought to be about 27,000 light-years long, running through its center at a 44 ± 10 degree angle to the line between the Sun and the center of the Galaxy. It is composed primarily of red stars, believed to be ancient (see [[red dwarf]], [[red giant]]). The bar is surrounded by a ring called the "5-[[Kiloparsec|kpc]] ring" that contains a large fraction of the molecular hydrogen present in the Galaxy, as well as most of the Milky Way's [[star formation]] activity. Viewed from the [[Andromeda Galaxy]], it would be the brightest feature of our own galaxy.<ref name="fn14">{{cite web

===Spiral arms===
Each spiral arm describes a [[logarithmic spiral]] (as do the arms of all spiral galaxies) with a pitch of approximately 12 degrees. There are believed to be four major spiral arms which all start at the Galaxy's center. These are named as follows, according to the image at left:

|}

Outside of the major spiral arms is the [[Outer Ring]] or [[Monoceros Ring]], a ring of stars around the Milky Way proposed by astronomers Brian Yanny and Heidi Jo Newberg, which consists of gas and stars torn from other galaxies billions of years ago.

As is typical for many galaxies, the distribution of mass in the Milky Way Galaxy is such that the [[orbital speed]] of most stars in the Galaxy does not depend strongly on its distance from the center. Away from the central bulge or outer rim, the typical stellar velocity is between 210 and 240&nbsp;km/s.<ref name="fn4">{{cite web

 | title=Mass of the Milky Way Galaxy
 | publisher=University of Oregon
 | accessdate=2007-05-10 }}</ref> Hence the [[orbital period]] of the typical star is directly proportional only to the length of the path traveled. This is unlike in the Solar System where different orbits are also expected to have significantly different velocities associated with them, and is one of the major pieces of evidence for the existence of [[dark matter]]. Another interesting aspect is the so-called "wind-up problem" of the spiral arms. If one believes that the inner parts of the arms rotate faster than the outer part, then the Galaxy will wind up so much that the spiral structure will be thinned out. But this is not what is observed in spiral galaxies; instead, astronomers propose that the spiral arms form as a result of a matter-density wave emanating from the galactic center. This can be likened to a moving traffic jam on a highway — the cars are all moving, but there is always a region of slow-moving cars. Thus this results in several spiral arms where there are a lot of stars and gas. This model also agrees with enhanced star formation in or near spiral arms; the compressional waves increase the density of molecular hydrogen and protostars form as a result.

However, a few globular clusters have been found farther, such as PAL 4 and AM1 at more than 200,000 light-years away from the galactic center.

Active [[star formation]] takes place in the disk (especially in the spiral arms, which represent areas of high density), but not in the halo. [[Open cluster]]s also occur primarily in the disk.

Similarly, with the discovery of the [[Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy]], it was found that a ring of galactic debris from its interaction with the Milky Way encircles the galactic disk.

On [[January 9]] [[2006]], [[Mario Juric]] and others of [[Princeton University]] announced that the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] of the northern sky found a huge and diffuse structure (spread out across an area around 5,000 times the size of a full moon) within the Milky Way that does not seem to fit within current models. The collection of stars rises close to perpendicular to the plane of the spiral arms of the Galaxy. The proposed likely interpretation is that a [[dwarf galaxy]] is merging with the Milky Way. This galaxy is tentatively named the [[Virgo Stellar Stream]] and is found in the direction of [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]] about 30,000 light-years away.

===Sun's location===
The [[Sun]] (and therefore the [[Earth]] and [[Solar System]]) may be found close to the inner rim of the Galaxy's [[Orion Arm]], in the [[Local Fluff]] or the [[Gould Belt]], at a hypothesized distance of 7.62±0.32 [[Kiloparsec|kpc]] from the [[Galactic Center]].<ref name="distance1">{{cite journal

}}</ref> The Sun, and thus the Solar System, is found in what scientists call the [[Habitable zone#Galactic habitable zone|galactic habitable zone]].

The Apex of the Sun's Way, or the [[solar apex]], is the direction that the Sun travels through space in the Milky Way. The general direction of the Sun's galactic motion is towards the star [[Vega]] near the constellation of [[Hercules (constellation)|Hercules]], at an angle of roughly 60 sky degrees to the direction of the [[Galactic Center]]. The Sun's orbit around the Galaxy is expected to be roughly elliptical with the addition of perturbations due to the galactic spiral arms and non-uniform mass distributions. In addition the Sun oscillates up and down relative to the galactic plane approximately 2.7 times per orbit. This is very similar to how a [[simple harmonic oscillator]] works with no drag force (damping) term. Due to the higher density of stars close to the galactic plane, these oscillations often coincide with [[mass extinction]] periods on earth, presumably due to increased [[impact events]].<ref name="extinction">{{cite journal

{{main|Local group|Andromeda-Milky Way collision}}
The Milky Way and the [[Andromeda Galaxy]] are a [[binary system (astronomy)|binary system]] of giant spiral galaxies belonging to a group of 50 closely bound galaxies known as the [[Local Group]], itself being part of the [[Virgo Supercluster]].

Two smaller galaxies and a number of [[dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]] in the Local Group [[orbit]] the Milky Way. The largest of these is the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]] with a diameter of 20,000 light-years. It has a close companion, the [[Small Magellanic Cloud]]. The [[Magellanic Stream]] is a peculiar streamer of neutral [[hydrogen]] gas connecting these two small galaxies. The stream is thought to have been dragged from the Magellanic Clouds in tidal interactions with the Galaxy. Some of the dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky Way are [[Canis Major Dwarf]] (the closest), [[Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy]], [[Ursa Minor Dwarf]], [[Sculptor Dwarf]], [[Sextans Dwarf]], [[Fornax Dwarf]], and [[Leo I Dwarf]]. The smallest Milky Way dwarf galaxies are only 500 light-years in diameter. These include [[Carina Dwarf]], [[Draco Dwarf]], and [[Leo II (dwarf galaxy)|Leo II Dwarf]]. There may still be undetected dwarf galaxies, which are dynamically bound to the Milky Way. Observations through the [[zone of avoidance]] are frequently detecting new distant and nearby galaxies. Some galaxies consisting mostly of gas and dust may also have evaded detection so far.

In January 2006, researchers reported that the heretofore unexplained warp in the disk of the Milky Way has now been mapped and found to be a ripple or vibration set up by the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds as they circle the Galaxy, causing vibrations at certain frequencies when they pass through its edges.<ref>{{cite press release

}}</ref>  Previously, these two galaxies, at around 2% of the mass of the Milky Way, were considered too small to influence the Milky Way. However, by taking into account [[dark matter]], the movement of these two galaxies creates a wake that influences the larger Milky Way. Taking dark matter into account results in an approximately twenty-fold increase in mass for the Galaxy. This calculation is according to a computer model made by Martin Weinberg of the [[University of Massachusetts, Amherst]]. In this model, the dark matter is spreading out from the galactic disc with the known gas layer. As a result, the model predicts that the gravitational effect of the Magellanic Clouds is amplified as they pass through the Galaxy.

Current measurements suggest the [[Andromeda Galaxy]] is approaching us at 100 to 140 kilometers per second. The Milky Way may collide with it in 3 to 4 billion years, depending on the importance of unknown lateral components to the galaxies' relative motion. If they collide, it is thought that the Sun and the other stars in the Milky Way will probably not collide with the stars of the Andromeda Galaxy, but that the two galaxies will merge to form a single [[elliptical galaxy]] over the course of about a billion years.<ref>{{cite news | first=Janet | last=Wong | title=Astrophysicist maps out our own galaxy's end | publisher=University of Toronto | date=[[April 14]], [[2000]] | url=http://www.news.utoronto.ca/bin/000414b.asp | accessdate=2007-01-11 }}</ref>

==Velocity==
In the general sense, the absolute velocity of any object through space is not a meaningful question according to [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[Special relativity|special theory of relativity]], which declares that there is no "preferred" [[inertial frame of reference]] in space with which to compare the Galaxy's motion. (Motion must always be specified with respect to another object.)

Astronomers believe the Milky Way is moving at approximately 600&nbsp;km per second relative to the observed locations of other nearby galaxies. Most recent estimates range from 130&nbsp;km/s to 1,000&nbsp;km/s. If the Galaxy is moving at 600&nbsp;km/s, Earth travels 51.84 million km per day, or more than 18.9 billion km per year, about 4.5 times its closest distance from [[Pluto]]. The Galaxy is thought to be moving towards the constellation [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]], and may someday become a close-knit member of the [[Virgo cluster]] of galaxies.

<span id="cmb"/>Another reference frame is provided by the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB). The Milky Way appears to be moving at around 552&nbsp;km/s<ref name="dipole"/> with respect to the photons of the CMB. This motion is observed by satellites such as [[COBE]] and [[WMAP]] as a dipole contribution to the CMB, as photons in equilibrium in the CMB frame get [[Doppler effect|blue-shifted]] in the direction of the motion and [[redshift|red-shifted]] in the opposite direction.

==History== 
===Etymology and beliefs===
[[Image:Jacopo Tintoretto 011.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jacopo Tintoretto]]'s "''The Origin of the Milky Way''"]]
{{main|List of names for the Milky Way|Milky Way (mythology)}}
There are many [[creation myth]]s around the world which explain the origin of the Milky Way and give it its name. The [[English language|English]] phrase is a translation from [[Greek language|Greek]] Γαλαξίας, ''Galaxias'', which is derived from the word for milk (γάλα, ''gala''). This is also the origin of the word ''[[galaxy]]''. In [[Greek mythology|Greek myth]], the Milky Way was caused by milk spilt by [[Hera]] when suckling [[Heracles]].

The term ''Milky Way'' first appeared in [[English literature]] in a poem by [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]].
{{Quote|"See yonder, lo, the Galaxyë<br />&nbsp;Which men clepeth the Milky Wey,<br />&nbsp;For hit is whyt."|Geoffrey Chaucer|Geoffrey Chaucer ''[[The House of Fame]]'', ''c.'' 1380.<ref>{{cite web

| accessdate = 2007-01-03
}}</ref>}}

In a large area from [[Central Asia]] to [[Africa]], the name for the Milky Way is related to the word for [[straw]]. It has been claimed that this was spread by [[Arab]]s who in turn borrowed the word from [[Armenian language|Armenian]].<ref>{{cite journal

 | accessdate = 2007-01-05 }}</ref> In several [[Uralic languages|Uralic]],  [[Turkic languages]], [[Fenno-Ugric languages]] and in the [[Baltic languages]] the Milky Way is called the "Birds' Path". The [[Chinese language|Chinese]] name "Silver River" (銀河) is used throughout [[East Asia]], including [[Korea]] and [[Japan]]. An alternative name for the Milky Way in ancient China, especially in poems, is "Heavenly River of [[Han]]"(天汉). In [[Japanese language|Japanese]], "Silver River" (銀河 ''ginga'') means galaxies in general and the Milky Way is called the "Silver River System" (銀河系 ''gingakei'') or the "River of Heaven" (天の川 ''ama no kawa''). In [[Swedish language|Swedish]], it is called ''Vintergatan'', or "Winter Street", because the stars in the belt were used to predict time of the approaching winter.

[[Image:Herschel-Galaxy.png|thumb|right|The shape of the Milky Way as deduced from star counts by William Herschel in 1785; the Solar System was assumed near center.]]
As [[Aristotle]] informs us in ''[[Meteorologica]]'' (DK 59 A80), the [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]]s [[Anaxagoras]] (ca. 500 BC–428 BC) and  [[Democritus]] (450–370 BC) proposed that the Milky Way might consist of distant [[star]]s. The [[Islamic astronomy|Persian astronomer]] [[Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī]] (973-1048 AD) further proposed the Milky Way [[galaxy]] to be a collection of countless [[Nebula|nebulous]] stars.<ref>{{MacTutor Biography|id=Al-Biruni|title=Abu Rayhan Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Biruni}}</ref> Actual proof of this came in 1610 when [[Galileo Galilei]] used a [[Optical telescope|telescope]] to study the Milky Way and discovered that it was composed of a huge number of faint stars.<ref>{{cite web | author=J.

The resulting disk of stars would be seen as a band on the sky from our perspective inside the disk. Kant also conjectured that some of the [[nebula]]e visible in the night sky might be separate "galaxies" themselves, similar to our own.<ref name="our_galaxy">{{cite web | last = Evans | first = J.

The first attempt to describe the shape of the Milky Way and the position of the [[Sun]] within it was carried out by [[William Herschel]] in 1785 by carefully counting the number of stars in different regions of the sky. He produced a diagram of the shape of the Galaxy with the Solar System close to the center.
[[Image:Pic iroberts1.jpg|thumb|left|Photograph of the "Great Andromeda Nebula" from 1899, later identified as the [[Andromeda Galaxy]]]]
In 1845, [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse|Lord Rosse]] constructed a new telescope and was able to distinguish between elliptical and spiral-shaped nebulae. He also managed to make out individual point sources in some of these nebulae, lending credence to Kant's earlier conjecture.<ref>{{cite web | last = Abbey | first = Lenny | url = http://labbey.com/Telescopes/Parsontown.html | title = The Earl of Rosse and the Leviathan of Parsontown | publisher = The Compleat Amateur Astronomer | accessdate = 2007-01-04 }}</ref>

In 1917, [[Heber Curtis]] had observed the nova [[S Andromedae]] within the "Great [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]] Nebula" ([[Messier object]] [[Andromeda Galaxy|M31]]). Searching the photographic record, he found 11 more [[nova]]e. Curtis noticed that these novae were, on average, 10 [[magnitude (astronomy)|magnitudes]] fainter than those that occurred within our galaxy. As a result he was able to come up with a distance estimate of 150,000 parsecs. He became a proponent of the "island universes" hypothesis, which held that the spiral nebulae were actually independent galaxies.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Heber D. Curtis | authorlink=Heber Doust Curtis | title=Novae in Spiral Nebulae and the Island Universe Theory | journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific | year=1988 | volume=100 | pages=6 | url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1988PASP..100....6C | doi=10.1086/132128 }}</ref> In 1920 the [[The Great Debate|Great Debate]] took place between [[Harlow Shapley]] and Heber Curtis, concerning the nature of the Milky Way, spiral nebulae, and the dimensions of the universe. To support his claim that the Great Andromeda Nebula was an external galaxy, Curtis noted the appearance of dark lanes resembling the dust clouds in the Milky Way, as well as the significant [[Doppler effect|Doppler shift]].<ref>{{cite web | first=Harold F. | last=Weaver | url = http://www.nap.edu/readingroom/books/biomems/rtrumpler.html | title = Robert Julius Trumpler | publisher = National Academy of Sciences | accessdate = 2007-01-05 }}</ref>

The matter was conclusively settled by [[Edwin Hubble]] in the early 1920s using a new telescope. He was able to resolve the outer parts of some spiral nebulae as collections of individual stars and identified some [[Cepheid variable]]s, thus allowing him to estimate the distance to the nebulae: they were far too distant to be part of the Milky Way.<ref>{{cite journal | author=E.
