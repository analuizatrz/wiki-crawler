The '''Boy Scouts of America''' ('''BSA''') is the largest [[youth organization]] in the United States; over one hundred million Americans have been members. Founded in 1910 as part of the [[Scouting|Scout Movement]], it had a registered membership of 2,938,698 youth with 1,146,130 leaders in 122,582 units as of the end of 2005.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.scouting.org/media/review/2005.html | title =Year in Review: 2005 | format = | work = | publisher =Boy Scouts of America | accessdate =2006-07-19}}</ref>  The BSA employs professionals at the higher levels of administration and for commercial activities but individual units rely on volunteers.

The BSA sprang from the concerns of the [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive movement in the United States]] from people who sought to promote the [[social welfare]] of young men. The BSA adheres to the [[Scout method]] to teach values such as [[self-esteem]], [[citizenship]], and [[outdoors]]manship through a variety of outdoor activities such as [[camping]], [[aquatics]], and [[hiking]].<ref name="vision">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.scouting.org/nav/enter.jsp?s=mc&c=mv | title =Mission Statement and Vision Statement | format = | work = | publisher =Boy Scouts of America | accessdate =2006-10-10}}</ref><ref name="mbcom">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.meritbadge.com/info/aims.htm | title =Boy Scout Aims and Methods | format = | work = | publisher = Meritbadge.com | accessdate =2006-10-27}}</ref>  

The BSA recognizes the achievements of Scouts through advancement in rank and various special awards.  It includes several program divisions, targeted at boys ages seven through seventeen and young men and women ages fourteen through twenty-one.  The BSA operates locally, through volunteer-led units such as troops, packs, and crews.

==Origins==
{{main|History of the Boy Scouts of America}}
The [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive movement]] in the United States was at its height during the early twentieth century.  With the migration of families from rural to urban centers, there were concerns that young men were no longer learning patriotism and individualism.  The [[YMCA]] was an early promoter of [[social welfare]] and other reforms involving young men.  [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]] started [[Scouting]] in 1907 in [[Great Britain]] and the [[Social movement|movement]] began to grow.<ref name="NT">{{cite journal | first = Jonny | last = Beardsall | title = Dib, dib, dib... One hundred years of scouts at Brownsea | journal = The [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] Magazine  | year = 2007 | issue = Spring 2007 | pages = pages 52-55}}</ref>

In 1909, Chicago publisher [[William D. Boyce|W. D. Boyce]] was visiting [[London, England]] where he learned of the Scouting movement.<ref>{{cite web | last = Peterson | first = Robert | authorlink = | coauthors = | year =2001 | url =http://www.scoutingmagazine.org/issues/0110/d-wwas.html | title =The Man Who Got Lost in the Fog | format = | work =Scouting Magazine| publisher =Boy Scouts of America | accessdate = 2006-07-11}}</ref> Upon his return to the US, Boyce incorporated the Boy Scouts of America on [[February 8]], [[1910]].<ref>{{cite book | last =Rowan | first =Edward L | authorlink = | coauthors = | year =2005 | title =To Do My Best: James E. West and the History of the Boy Scouts of America | publisher =Las Vegas International Scouting Museum | location = | id =ISBN 0-9746479-1-8 }}</ref>  The YMCA became interested in the nascent BSA program and provided support.  The first managing secretary was John M. Alexander, succeeded by [[Edgar M. Robinson]], both from the YMCA.  [[James E. West (Scouting)|James E. West]] took over as managing secretary and later as [[Chief Scout Executive]], beginning a long relationship with the BSA.

==Ideals==
[[Image:BSA 2006-2010 Strategic Plan.png|thumb|150px|BSA "Strategic Plan Identity" emblem]]
The stated objectives of the BSA are referred to as "Aims of Scouting": character development, citizenship training, and personal fitness. Each of the programs of the BSA pursues these aims through methods that are designed to be appropriate for the age and maturity of the participants.<ref name="ldrtrng">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.scouting.org/boyscouts/resources/18-813/basic.html | title =Basic Leader Training | format = | work = | publisher =Boy Scouts of America | accessdate =2006-10-10}}</ref>  One of these methods is the establishment of ideals.  These are statements of goals against which each youth can measure and improve themself.  For Boy Scouts and Varsity Scouts, these ideals are reflected in the [[Scout Oath]], [[Scout Law|Law]], Motto and Slogan.  There are similar sets of ideals for [[Cub Scouts]] and Venturers.

:''Be Prepared.''
;The Scout Slogan<ref name="11thhandbook"/>
:''Do a Good Turn Daily.''
;The Scout Oath<ref name="11thhandbook"/>
:''On my honor, I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country and to obey the Scout Law; to help other people at all times; to keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight.''
;The Scout Law<ref name="11thhandbook"/>
:''A Scout is trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean and reverent.''
;The Outdoor Code<ref name="11thhandbook"/>
:''As an American, I will do my best to be clean in my outdoor manners, be careful with fire, be considerate in the outdoors, and be conservation-minded.''
;The Scout Sign<ref name="11thhandbook"/>
:The upper arm is held horizontally out to the right side, and the forearm is held vertically, making a right angle. This is to symbolize the fact that Scouts always do the right thing.  The palm of the hand faces forward, with the first three fingers extended and the tips of the little finger and thumb joined. The sign is often used to quiet scouts, when attention is required by a leader.
;The Scout Salute<ref name="11thhandbook"/>
:A [[three-finger salute (Scouts)|three-finger salute]] using the same configuration as the Scout Sign, with the tip of the [[index finger]] touching the forehead or hat brim.
;The Scout Handshake<ref name="11thhandbook"/>
:This is the traditional [[handshake]] done with the left hand, because upon meeting the Zulu king, [[Dinuzulu]], the king removed his shield which was worn on the left arm and extended to Lord Baden-Powell a hand shake with his left hand. The left hand shake was a Zulu sign of vulnerability and respect.
The BSA Scout Oath and Law have remained unchanged since they were first developed in 1910.<ref name="v6n4">{{cite journal|last=Scott| first=David C.| year=2006| title=The Origins of BSA's 1910 Handbook| journal=International Scouting Collectors Association Journal (ISCA Journal) | volume=6| issue=4| pages=6-13}}</ref><ref name="11thhandbook"/>

==Membership==
The BSA's Scouting program has three membership divisions:
*'''[[Cub Scouts (Boy Scouts of America)|Cub Scouting]]''', the largest of the three divisions, is available to boys from first-grade through fifth-grade, (seven through ten years old) and their families. The Cub Scout program uses a fun and challenging system to pursue the aims of character development, citizenship training, and personal fitness.<ref name="vision"/> The program is divided into age-based programs of Tiger Cubs, Wolf Cubs, Bear Cubs and Webelos (acronymn for 'We'll be loyal scouts').
*'''[[Boy Scouts (Boy Scouts of America)|Boy Scouting]]''' is the flagship program of the BSA for boys ten to eighteen.  The program uses a system of outdoor activities to achieve the aims of Scouting.  '''[[Varsity Scouts (Boy Scouts of America)|Varsity Scouting]]''' is a modified Boy Scout program available to boys from fourteen through seventeen that adds a system of [[high adventure]] and sporting activities to appeal to the older boy, with an emphasis on team competition.  The '''[[Order of the Arrow]]''' (OA) is the Boy Scout national honor society for experienced campers, based on [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]]<!--- American Indian is the preferred usage by the BSA.  Read the linked article for a thorough discussion.---> traditions, and dedicated to the ideal of cheerful service and brotherhood.
*'''[[Venturing (Boy Scouts of America)|Venturing]]''' is the program for young men and women ages fourteen through twenty-one.<ref name="venturerage">Venturer Application 28-303K: "Venturers registered in a crew or ship prior to their twenty-first birthday may continue as members after their 21st birthday until the crew or ship recharters or they reach their twenty-second birthday, whichever comes first."</ref> Its purpose is to provide positive experiences to help youth mature and to prepare them to become responsible adults.  Venturing is based on a unique and dynamic relationship between youth, adult leaders, and organizations in their communities.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.scouting.org/factsheets/02-388.html | title =What is Venturing | format = | work =Fact Sheet | publisher =Boy Scouts of America | accessdate =2006-10-10}}</ref>  '''[[Sea Scouts (Boy Scouts of America)|Sea Scouting]]''' is the nautical oriented part of this division.

==Organization==
===National Council=== 
The National Council is the corporate membership of the Boy Scouts of America that is [[Congressional charter|chartered]] by the United States Congress to operate the BSA program. The National Council members include the elected National Executive Board, the regional executive committees, the local council representatives, members at large, and honorary members.  The National program is directed by the National Executive Board and administered by the [[Chief Scout Executive]] using a staff of professional Scouters.  National is registered as a [[non-profit]] private corporation and is funded from private donations, membership dues, corporate sponsors, and special events.

The BSA is governed by the National Executive Board and directed by the [[national president of the Boy Scouts of America|national president]].<ref name="bsaorg">{{cite web | last = Nelson | first = Bill| authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year =  | url = http://usscouts.org/aboutbsa/bsaorg.html| title = BSA National Office: Organization of the Boy Scouts of America | format =  | work = | publisher = U.S. Scouting Service Project | accessdate = 2007-02-16}}</ref>  Board memberships include regular elected members, presidents, the Advisory Council chair and the chairman of the Board of Regents of the National Eagle Scout Association.  The board may also include up to five appointed youth members.  Professional Scouters of the National staff are nonvoting members.

The National Executive Board has five group standing committees: the Administration Group Committee, Program Group Committee, Human Resources Group Committee, Regional Presidents' Group Committee, and Relationships/Marketing Group Committee.  Each of these committees is in turn directly responsible for a corresponding support group that provides administrative functions.  Group committees may in turn be responsible for support standing committees and groups divided into divisions.

===Regions and areas===
<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:RegionMap copy.jpg|thumb|right|200px|<center>BSA Regions</center>]] -->
For administrative purposes, the BSA is divided into four regions–Western, Central, Southern and Northeast.<ref name="bsaorg"/>  Each region is subdivided into areas, about six per region.  These are then divided into local councils, the BSA's main administrative level (as of 2006, a total of 308).  Councils are subdivided into districts, which in turn directly interact with BSA's units.

From the early 1920s, the BSA was divided into 12 numbered regions (each designated by a roman numeral) which consisted of territories of several states.  The 12 regions followed the organization of the federal reserve system at that time.

During a major reorganization of the BSA in 1972, the 12 regions were consolidated into a new alignment of six geographic regions (Northeast, East Central, Southeast, North Central, South Central, and Western).  In 1992, the six regions were reorganized again into the four regions that exist to this date.  According to the BSA division of 1992[http://dmoz.org/Recreation/Scouting/Organizations/Boy_Scouts_of_America/Councils/desc.html]:

*The '''Central Region''' covers all of Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota, Ohio, Wisconsin, and parts of Indiana, Kentucky, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Virginia and West Virginia.

*The '''Northeast Region'''[http://www.nerbsa.org/] covers all of Connecticut, District of Columbia, Delaware, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Puerto Rico, Transatlantic Council, and the Virgin Islands, and parts of Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia.

*The '''Southern Region'''[http://srbsa.org/] covers all of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Tennessee, and parts of Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia.

*The '''Western Region''' covers all of Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington, Wyoming, Far East Council and the Pacific Basin, and parts of Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota and Texas.

Note, some states on the borders are split between two regions. 

Each region has a volunteer president, assisted by volunteer officers and board members, and the day-to-day work of Scouting is managed by the regional director, assistant and associate regional directors, and area directors.  All regions and areas are subdivisions of the National Council and do not have a corporate status separate from the BSA.

===Local councils===
:''Main category: [[:Category:Boy Scouts of America Local Councils|Boy Scouts of America Local Councils]]''

The BSA currently has 308 local councils, which are incorporated organizations that administer BSA programs in defined geographical areas (ranging anywhere from a single city to a wide-ranging area consisting of a whole state or more).  Each council is chartered annually by the National Council.<ref name="bsaorg"/>  The vast bulk of councils of the Boy Scouts of America have gone through thousands of name changes, merges, splits and re-creations since the concept was introduced in the 1910s. 

The actual voting members of each council consist of volunteer representatives from each organization (chartered organization) currently having at least one BSA unit, plus annually elected members-at-large.  The monthly operations of each council are managed through its volunteer executive board, led by its council president (chairman of the board).  Certain other volunteers known as commissioners are appointed by the council to work directly with units, and are under the supervision of the council commissioner, also a volunteer.

Day-to-day council operations and directed by its chief executive officer called the Scout executive (sometimes called the council executive), a employed professional Scouter commissioned by the BSA, who hires and supervises other commissioned professionals and other support staff.

[[Image:Philly Scout.png|thumb|Bruce S. Marks Scout Resource Center]]

The BSA also charters two councils for Scouts who live overseas, largely on military bases in Europe and Asia.  The [[American Scouting overseas#Transatlantic Council|Transatlantic Council]], headquartered in Germany, serves US Scouts in much of Europe, and the [[American Scouting overseas#Far East Council|Far East Council]], headquartered in Japan, serves several nations in the western Pacific.  The [[American Scouting overseas#Direct Service|Direct Service]] branch makes the Scouting program available to US citizens and their dependents living in countries outside these jurisdictions or in isolated areas.  The [[Scouting in Hawaii#Aloha Council|Aloha Council]] in Hawaii also serves BSA units in the American territories of [[American Samoa]], [[Guam]], the [[Northern Marianas Islands]] and in the sovereign countries of the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], the [[Marshall Islands]] and [[Palau]].

===Boroughs===
Because of the high density of units, the Greater New York Councils<!---sic---> is divided into five boroughs with each led by a borough Scout executive.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.bsa-gnyc.org/ | title =Greater New York Councils | format = | work = | publisher = | accessdate =2006-08-08}}</ref>  Each borough  is then divided into districts.

===Districts===
[[Image:Commissioner logo.png|thumb|75px|Commissioner]]
Councils are divided into districts with leadership provided by the district executive, district chairman, and the [[Commissioner Service|district commissioner]].<ref name="bsaorg"/>  Districts are directly responsible for the operation of Scouting units and, except for the district executive, are mostly staffed with volunteers.

===Units===
The unit is the main program group of the BSA.<ref name="bsaorg"/>  Cub Scouts are organized as packs, Boy Scouts as troops, Varsity Scouts as teams, Venturers as crews, and Sea Scouts as ships.  Each unit is sponsored by a community organization such as a business, service organization, school, labor group, or religious institution. The chartered organization is responsible for selecting leadership, providing a meeting place, and promoting a good program. The chartered organization representative is the liaison between the unit, the chartered organization, and the BSA.

The unit is led by a registered and trained leader (Cubmaster, Scoutmaster, Coach, Advisor, or Skipper) with one or more assistants. The unit committee is a group of adults, led by the committee chairman, who plan the unit program and activities and manage record keeping, finance, leadership recruitment, and registration.

==Activities==
The National Council is divided into several administrative branches, called "groups." Each group is comprised of divisions that support the Scouting program in various ways.  
===Publications===
The National Council Relationships/Publications Group publishes two magazines through the Marketing and Communications Division: ''[[Scouting magazine|Scouting]]'' is targeted towards adult leaders while ''[[Boys' Life]]'' is for the youth. ''Boys' Life'' is published in three editions.  The low edition is for Tiger Cubs and Cub Scouts through age eight; the middle edition is for Cub Scouts and Webelos Scouts above age nine; the high edition is for Boy Scouts and all other subscribers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scouting.org/factsheets/02-501.html |title=BSA at a Glance |accessdate=2007-02-15 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |format= |work=Fact Sheet |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>  If the subscription is obtained through registration in the BSA program, the publisher will select the appropriate edition based on the boy's age.

===Scoutreach===
A play on words combing "scout" and "outreach", the Scoutreach Division emphasizes service to rural and urban areas and to minority populations.    The African American Focus works with the African American population in partnerships with the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]], [[Alpha Phi Alpha]], [[Kappa Alpha Psi]], the [[NAACP]], African-American Baptist Churches, and other groups.  The Hispanic/Latino Focus is the Scouting - Vale La Pena program for Hispanic youth.<ref>{{cite web  | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year =  | url = http://www.scoutreachbsa.org/ | title = Scoutreach Division&ndash; BSA | format =  | work =  | publisher = Boy Scouts of America | accessdate = 2006-03-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year =  | url =  http://www.scoutingvalelapena.org/ | title = Scouting - Vale La Pena | format =  | work =

The Soccer and Scouting program is a partnership with the [[NSCAA]] to provide an alternative program for Cub Scout age Hispanic youth.<ref>{{cite web  | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year =  | url = http://www.soccerandscouting.org/index.html | title = Soccer and Scouting | format =  | work =  | publisher = Boy Scouts of America | accessdate = 2007-02-17}}</ref>  The Asian American Focus reaches out to Indo-Chinese American, Vietnamese American, Chinese American and Korean American communities.  The Rural Scouting focus targets small communities and includes the [[American Indian Scouting Association]], a partnership with the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]].

===Other divisions===
[[Image:ToothofTime.JPG|thumb|Tooth of Time]]
The High Adventure Division administers [[Philmont Scout Ranch]], [[Northern Tier National High Adventure Bases]] and [[Florida National High Adventure Sea Base]].  
The Jamboree Division provides support for the [[World Scout Jamboree|world]] and [[National Scout jamboree (Boy Scouts of America)|national]] jamborees. The International Division is responsible for relations with other Scout and Guide organizations; it includes the Interamerican Scout Foundation and [[Direct Service]].<ref>{{cite web | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year =  | url = http://www.interamfoundation.org/ | title = Interamerican Scout Foundation | format =  | work =  | publisher =  | accessdate =2006-03-13}}</ref> The Relationships Division is responsible for relations with supporting organizations outside the BSA, including the [[AFL-CIO]], [[Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks|Elks]], [[Veterans of Foreign Wars|VFW]] and all religious associations and awards.<ref>{{cite web | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year =  | url = http://www.scouting.org/relationships/index.html | title = Relationships Division | format =  | work =  | publisher = Boy Scouts of America | accessdate = 2006-03-13}}</ref> Supply Division is responsible for uniforms and apparel, insignia, literature and equipment.

===Learning for Life===
[[Image:Learning for Life.svg|thumb|Learning for Life]]
[[Learning for Life]] (LFL) is an [[United States]] school and work-site based program that is a subsidiary of the BSA.  It utilizes programs designed for schools and community-based organizations that are designed to prepare youth for the complexities of contemporary society and to enhance their self-confidence, motivation, and self-esteem.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.learning-for-life.org/ |title=Learning for Life - Exploring |accessdate=2006-01-15 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

==Finance==
In 2005, the BSA ranked as the twelfth-largest [[non-profit]] organization in the US, with total revenues of $665.9 million.  As of January 2007, the American Institute of Philanthropy lists the Chief Scout Executive as having the fifth-highest compensation of any nonprofit chief in the United States, at $916,028.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.charitywatch.org/criteria.html#top20 | title =Top 25 compensation packages | format = | work =American Institute of Philanthropy | publisher = | accessdate =2007-02-15}}</ref>   In 2005, the Chief Scout Executive's pay was 0.26% of total expenses, whereas the national average among charities stands at a higher 0.34%.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm/bay/content.view/catid/68/cpid/304.htm
 | title =CEO compensation | format = | work =Charity Navigator | publisher = | accessdate =2006-02-06}}</ref>  The Chief Scout Executive was honored in August 2005 as one of the top fifty most effective non-profit leaders by the Non-Profit Times.  By comparison, the Chief Executive Officer of the similar [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] earns 0.39% of total expenses.

==National Scouting Museum==
The National Scouting Museum was founded in 1959 in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]]. In 1986, it was moved to [[Murray State University]] in [[Murray, Kentucky]]  and moved to its present location in [[Irving, Texas]] in 2002.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bsamuseum.org/ |title=National Scouting Museum |accessdate=2007-02-15 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |format= |work= |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>  The museum floor is 53,000&nbsp;ft² (5000&nbsp;m²) and is a modern facility, featuring several [[Norman Rockwell]] paintings, high adventure sections, hands-on learning experiences, interactive exhibits, and a historical collection tracing uniforms, themes, and documents from the beginning of the American Scouting movement.<ref name="natlmuseum">{{cite web | url = http://www.bsamuseum.org/ | title = National Scouting Museum |publisher = National Scouting Museum, Boy Scouts of America | accessdate = 2006-02-15}}</ref> Among the museum's artifacts are the Eagle Scout  medal of [[Arthur Rose Eldred]], the first [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]].<ref name="eaglescoutorg">{{cite web | url = http://www.eaglescout.org/history/first_eagle.html | title = BSA's first Eagle Scout | publisher = Eagle Scout Resource Center | accessdate = 2006-07-07}}</ref>

==Good Turns==
[[Image:Smokey with scouts.png|thumb|right|[[Smokey Bear]] with members of the Boy Scouts of America and the [[Camp Fire Girls]] celebrating the 50th anniversary of their founding in 1910.]]
In 1913, Scouts began the first of a series of Good Turns that included the promotion of a safe and sane [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]].  During the 50th anniversary of the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], Scouts provided service to the veterans.  Scouts rendered aid during the 1921 floods in [[Pueblo, Colorado]] and [[San Antonio, Texas]].  President Roosevelt delivered a radio address in 1934 appealing for assistance for the distressed and needy: Scouts responded by collecting almost two millions items of clothing, household furnishings, foodstuffs, and supplies.

The National Conservation Good Turn in 1954 saw Scouts distribute 3.6 million conservation posters, 6.2 million trees, build and place 55,000 bird-nesting boxes, and arrange 41,000 conservation displays.  During the height of the [[Cold War]] in 1958, the BSA delivered 40 million Civil Defense emergency handbooks and distributed 50,000 posters.

1986 saw the Donor Awareness Good Turn: 600,000 youth members distributed 14 million brochures to families, informing them of the needs for organ donations.  In 1997, the [[President of the United States]] called for an increase in volunteer service in the US.  The BSA developed the Service to America program with a commitment to provide 200 million hours of service by youth members by the end of the year 2000.  As part of Service to America, the BSA provided service projects in conjunction with the [[National Park Service]] (NPS).  In October 2003, the [[Department of the Interior]] expanded the program with the creation of the Take Pride in America program, opening service to all Americans.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.takepride.gov/index.cfm | title =Take Pride in America | format = | work = | publisher =Department of the Interior | accessdate =2006-03-30}}</ref>

The BSA developed Good Turn for America in 2004 as a program to address the problems of hunger, homelessness and inadequate housing and poor health in conjunction with the [[Salvation Army]], the [[American Red Cross]], and [[Habitat for Humanity]].<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.goodturnforamerica.org/ | title =Good Turn for America | format = | work = | publisher =Boy Scouts of America | accessdate =2006-03-30}}</ref>

==Advancement and recognition==
{{main|Advancement and recognition in the Boy Scouts of America}}
[[Image:MeritBadgeSash.JPG|Merit badge sash|thumb|100px]]
Advancement is one of the methods used to achieve the aims of character development, citizenship training, and personal fitness.

Cub Scouts advance through Bobcat, Tiger Cub, Wolf Cub, Bear Cub and Webelos Scout.  The Arrow of Light award is the highest award available to Cub Scouts and helps to prepare Webelos Scouts for the transition to Boy Scouting.  The Cub Scouts Academics and Sports Program is designed toward the third aim of Scouting:<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://usscouts.org/advance/cubscout/a-s.html | title =Cub Scout Academics and Sports Program | format = | work = | publisher =U.S. Scouting Service Project |  accessdate=2006-03-27}}</ref> the development of physical, mental and emotional fitness.  It is an optional program for all Cub Scouts and is designed to assist in learning or improving skills. 

The advancement program for Boy Scouts has two phases.  The first phase of Scout to First Class is designed to teach the boy [[Scoutcraft]] skills, how to participate in a group and to learn self-reliance.  Scout is the joining rank, and is awarded when the Scout demonstrates a rudimentary knowledge of the Scouting ideals.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://usscouts.org/advance/boyscout/bsrank1.html | title =Boy Scout Joining Requirements | format = | work = | publisher =U.S. Scouting Service Project |  accessdate=2006-03-23}}</ref>  Tenderfoot,<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://usscouts.org/advance/boyscout/bsrank2.html | title =Tenderfoot Rank Requirement | format = | work = | publisher =U.S. Scouting Service Project |accessdate=2006-03-23}}</ref> Second Class,<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://usscouts.org/advance/boyscout/bsrank3.html | title =Second Class Rank Requirement | format = | work = | publisher =U.S. Scouting Service Project |accessdate=2006-03-23}}</ref> and First Class<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://usscouts.org/advance/boyscout/bsrank4.html | title =First Class Rank Requirement | format = | work = | publisher =U.S. Scouting Service Project|accessdate=2006-03-23}}</ref> have progressively harder requirements in the areas of Scoutcraft, physical fitness, citizenship, personal growth and [[Scout Spirit]]. The second half of the advancement program for Star, Life and [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]]  are based on career and avocation exploration through [[Merit Badge]]s, leadership responsibility in the troop, and performing service projects for the public good. After becoming an Eagle Scout, a Scout can be awarded Eagle Palms (first Bronze, then Gold, then Silver). A palm is earned by completing an additional five merit badges and demonstrating that he has upheld the ideals of Eagle Scout.

Although [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] is the highest rank and one all Scouts should strive for, the number of Scouts achieving First Class within one year of joining is still one of the key measures of unit effectiveness.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://webpages.charter.net/fptroop8/Troop%20Handbook.htm | title =Troop Handbook | format = | work = | publisher =Boy Scout Troop 8 | accessdate=2007-02-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2006| url =http://www.scouting.org/forms/34118.pdf | title =First Class-First Year Tracking Sheet| format = PDF | work = | publisher =Boy Scouts of America | accessdate=2007-02-17}}</ref>  Studies have shown that if a Scout achieves First Class within a year of joining, he typically stays in the Scout program for at least three years. Scouts who do so are more likely to retain Scout values as an adult and achieve the BSA primary mission of "producing useful citizens".

Varsity Scouts can earn any award or recognition that is available to Boy Scouts, including merit badges, ranks advancements, and other awards.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2007| url =http://www.usscouts.org/advance/boyscout/intro.html | title =Boy Scout Advancement| format = | work = | publisher =US Scouts.org | accessdate=2007-02-17}}</ref>   The Varsity Letter may be earned by participating in or accomplishing at least one high adventure or sports program, according to guidelines determined by the Varsity Coach, meeting attendance requirements and showing [[Scout Spirit]].  The Denali Award is the highest award in Varsity Scouting.

Venturers may earn a Bronze Award from a category of arts and hobbies, outdoor, religious life, Sea Scouting or sports.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2007| url =http://www.usscouts.org/advance/venturing/BronzeAwardFacts.html | title =Bronze Award Fact Sheet| format = | work = | publisher =US Scouts.org | accessdate=2007-02-17}}</ref> After earning at least one Bronze Award and meeting tenure, leadership, personal growth and other requirements the Venturer may earn the Gold Award. To earn the [[Silver (Venturing)|Silver Award]] the Venturer must earn the Gold Award, earn first aid and CPR certifications, show leadership and participate in ethics training.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2007| url =http://www.usscouts.org/advance/venturing/GoldAwardFacts.html | title =Gold Award Fact Sheet| format = | work = | publisher =US Scouts.org | accessdate=2007-02-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2007| url =http://www.usscouts.org/advance/venturing/SilverAwardFacts.html | title =Silver Award Overview| format = | work = | publisher =US Scouts.org | accessdate=2007-02-17}}</ref>   Venturers may also earn expert awards that build on some areas of the Bronze Awards. These include the Venturing Ranger Award (outdoors),<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2007| url =http://www.usscouts.org/advance/venturing/RangerAwardFacts.html | title =Ranger Award Fact Sheet| format = | work = | publisher =US Scouts.org | accessdate=2007-02-17}}</ref> the TRUST Award (religious life) and the Quest Award (sports). The Venturing Leadership Award and the Venturing Shooting Sports Outstanding Achievement Award may also be earned.

Sea Scouting has a rank progression of Apprentice, Ordinary, Able, and Quartermaster.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2007| url =http://www.usscouts.org/advance/venturing/Quartermaster.html| title =Quartermaster| format = | work = | publisher =US Scouts.org | accessdate=2007-02-17}}</ref>  Sea Scouts may also earn any Venturing award.  Advanced certifications include Qualified Seaman, Small Boat Handler, the Long Cruise Badge and Sea Scout Advanced Leader (SEAL).

Adult leaders who complete training, tenure, and performance requirements are recognized by a system of awards.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2007| url =http://www.usscouts.org/awards.asp| title =Awards: Adult Leaders| format = | work = | publisher =US Scouts.org | accessdate=2007-02-17}}</ref><ref name="ldrtrng"/>  The Cub Scouter Award is available to any Cub Scout leader, while the Tiger Cub Den Leader Award, Cub Scout Den Leader Award, Webelos Den Leader Award and the Cubmaster Award are available to those who have held the respective positions.  The Scouters Training Award is available to any Boy Scout leader, while the Scouter's Key and Scoutmaster Award of Merit are only available to the Scoutmaster.  Varsity leaders may earn the Varsity Letter and activity pins as well as any Boy Scout leader awards.  The Venturing Leader's Training Award and the Venturing Leadership Award are available to any Venturing leader, while the Venturing Advisor's Key and Venturing Advisor Award of Merit are only available to the Advisor.  The highest recognition for Scout leader training is [[Wood Badge]] for all Scouters and [[Sea Badge]] for Sea Scouters.

Several [[religious emblems programs (Boy Scouts of America)|religious emblems programs]] are administered by various religious institutions and recognized, but not sponsored, by the BSA.

==Uniform and insignia==

{{main|Uniform and insignia of the Boy Scouts of America}}
The Uniform and insignia of the Boy Scouts of America give a [[Scouting|Scout]] visibility and creates a level of identity within both the unit and the community.  The uniform is used to promote equality while showing individual achievement.  While all uniforms are similar in basic design, they do vary in color and detail to identify the different divisions of Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts, Varsity Scouts, Venturers and Sea Scouts.

Scouts and adult leaders wear the [[Uniform and insignia of the Boy Scouts of America#Boy Scout field uniform|Boy Scout field uniform]].<ref>{{cite web | author=Peterson, Robert| year=2002 | title=From Doughboy Duds to Oscar de la Renta | work=Scouting Magazine | url=http://www.scoutingmagazine.org/issues/0210/d-wwas.html | publisher = Boy Scouts of America | accessdate=2006-01-12}}</ref>  It generally consists of a [[khaki (color)|khaki]] shirt, [[olive (color)|olive green]] [[pants]] or [[shorts]], [[belt]], and [[neckerchief]].
The [[Uniform and insignia of the Boy Scouts of America#Scouter dress uniform|Scouter dress uniform]] is appropriate for professional Scouters and all Scouting leaders on formal occasions.<ref name="Scout Inspection">{{cite web | author= | year=2000 | title=Boy Scout/Varsity Scout Uniform Inspection Sheet | work= | url=http://www.scouting.org/forms/34283.pdf | id=#34283 |publisher = Boy Scouts of America | accessdate=2006-12-20}}</ref>

==Impact on American life==
[[Image:Derby icon.svg|thumb|Pinewood Derby Car]]
Scouting and Boy Scouts are well known throughout [[United States|American]] [[Scouting in popular culture|culture]].  Eleven of the twelve men to walk on the [[Moon]] were Scouts, with the first and last being Eagle Scouts, Neil Armstrong and Harrison Schmitt.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.scouting.org/factsheets/02-558.html | title =Astronauts and the BSA | format = | work = | publisher =Boy Scouts of America | accessdate =2006-10-09}}</ref> The "[[Pinewood Derby]]," for half a century "a celebrated rite of spring," has been named part of "America's 100 Best" by ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.rd.com/content/openContent.do?contentId=26667 | title =America's 100 Best: The 2006 List | format = | work = | publisher =Reader's Digest | accessdate=2006-10-10}}</ref> President [[Gerald Ford]] said, "I can say without hesitation, because of Scouting principles, I know I was a better athlete, I was a better naval officer, I was a better Congressman, and I was a better prepared President."<ref>{{cite web | last =Rumsfeld | first =Donald R | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.defenselink.mil/speeches/2006/sp20060526-13138.html | title =Speech: Boy Scout National Meeting Breakfast As Delivered by Secretary of Defense <nowiki>[</nowiki>and Eagle Scout<nowiki>]</nowiki> [[Donald Rumsfeld|Donald H.

==Membership controversies==

<!---This text is a SUMMARY of the MAIN points of the issues, and is a COPY of the lead-in to the main article.  Edits made to this section will be LOST when the main article lead-in is re-synched to this section.  --->
The Boy Scouts of America, the largest [[youth organization]] in the [[United States]], has [[policies]] which prohibit [[atheist]]s, [[Agnosticism|agnostics]], and known or avowed [[homosexuality|homosexuals]] from membership in its Scouting program; both youths and adults have had their memberships revoked as a result. The BSA contends that these policies are essential in its mission to instill in young people the [[values]] of the Scout Oath and Law.<ref name="core">{{cite web|url=http://www.bsalegal.org/core-values-286.asp|work=BSA Legal|title=Core Values|accessdate=2006-10-02}}</ref><ref name="duty">{{cite web| url=http://www.bsalegal.org/dutytogo-155.htm|work= BSA Legal Issues |title=Duty to God |accessdate=2006-10-22}}</ref>   The BSA also prohibits girls from participating in Cub Scouting and Boy Scouting. These policies are controversial and are considered by some to be discriminatory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atheism.about.com/b/a/258300.htm|title=Boy Scouts & Public Funding: Defending Bigotry as a Public Good|accessdate=2006-11-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsa-discrimination.org/|work=BSA Discrimination|title=Discrimination in the BSA|accessdate=2006-09-04}}</ref>

The organization's Constitutional right to have these policies has been upheld repeatedly by both [[state court|state]] and [[United States federal courts|federal court]]s. The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has affirmed that as a private organization, the BSA can set its own membership standards. In recent years, the policy disputes have led to litigation over the terms under which the BSA can access governmental resources, including public lands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2006/10/16/state/n075532D70.DTL|work=|title=Supreme Court Won't Review Berkeley Sea Scouts' Case|accessdate=2006-10-17}}</ref><!-- If the previous link goes dead over time, consider using http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1720255/posts -->
