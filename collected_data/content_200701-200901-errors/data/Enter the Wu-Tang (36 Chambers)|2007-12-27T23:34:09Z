'''''Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)''''' is the debut album of the [[East Coast hip hop|East Coast]] [[Rap music|hip hop]] collective [[Wu-Tang Clan|the Wu-Tang Clan]]. It was released on [[November 9]], [[1993]] by [[Loud Records]] and [[RCA Records|RCA]]. Many critics consider ''Enter The Wu-Tang'' one of the most significant albums of the 1990s and one of the greatest hip hop albums recorded.<ref name="RS90s">{{cite web | last = Otto | first = Jeff | url = http://www.rocklist.net/rstone.html#Recordings%20of%20the%20%E2%80%9890s | title = Rolling Stone Essential Albums of the 90s at Rocklist.net | format =  | work = | publisher = | accessdate = December 15 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref><ref name="TheSource">{{cite web | last = | first = | url = http://www.rocklist.net/source.htm | title = The Source's 100 Best Rap Albums at Rocklist.net | format =  | work = | publisher = | accessdate = December 12 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> The distinctive sound of ''Enter the Wu-Tang'' created a blueprint for [[hardcore rap]] in the mid-1990s and helped return New York City hip hop to national prominence.<ref name="AllMusicGuide">{{cite web | last = Huey | first = Steve | url = http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:ogd2vwdta9rk | title = Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) Review at All Music Guide | format = | work = | publisher = | accessdate = October 1 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> The Wu-Tang Clan's debut was a landmark album in an era known as the [[East Coast hip hop#The East Coast Renaissance|East Coast Renaissance]].<ref name="ProudFlesh">{{cite web | last = Yew | first = Ben | url = http://www.proudfleshjournal.com/issue3/yew.htm | title = Retrospect for Hip-Hop: A Golden Age on Record? at ProudFleshJournal.com

==Background==

===Conception===
In the late 1980s, cousins [[RZA|Robert Diggs]], [[GZA|Gary Grice]], and [[Ol' Dirty Bastard|Russell Jones]] formed a group named Force of the Imperial Master, also known as the [[All in Together Now Crew]].<ref name="Exclaim">{{cite web | last = Cowie  | first = Del F. | url = http://www.exclaim.ca/index.asp?layid=22&csid=1&csid1=914 | title = Days of the Wu at Exclaim.ca | format = | work = | publisher =  | accessdate = 
November 6 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> Each member recorded under an alias: Grice as The Genius, Diggs as Prince Rakeem or The Scientist, and Jones as The Specialist. The group never signed to a major label, but caught the attention of the New York rap scene and was recognized by rapper [[Biz Markie]].<ref name="RZAInterview">{{cite web | last = | first = | url = http://www.hiphopcore.net/interviews/rza_english.php3 | title = RZA Interview at HipHopCore.net | format = | work = | publisher = | accessdate = December 26 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> By 1991, The Genius and Prince Rakeem were signed to separate record labels. The Genius released ''[[Words from the Genius]]'' on [[Cold Chillin' Records]] and Prince Rakeem released ''[[Ooh I Love You Rakeem]]'' on [[Tommy Boy Records]]. 

Both were soon dropped by their labels. Embittered but unbowed, they took on new monikers (The Genius became [[GZA]] while Prince Rakeem became [[RZA]]) and refocused their efforts. RZA writes in ''[[The Wu-Tang Manual]]'' that "[Tommy Boy] made the decision to sign [[House of Pain]] over us. When they dropped me, I was thinking, 'Damn, they chose a bunch of whiteboy shit over me.'"<ref name="FirstSingle">{{cite web | last = Pfeifle | first = Sam | url = http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/arts/books/documents/04646062.asp | title = Days of the Wu - The RZA looks inside the Clan at BostonPhoenix.com | format = | work = | publisher =  | accessdate = October 16 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> In an interview with ''Think'' magazine, GZA summed up his animosity toward the artist and repertoire ([[A&R]]) division of record labels: {{cquote|Most A&R guys will try to make you into something that you're not. They think, oh you look like a pretty boy, let's make him a pretty boy, but that might not be your lifestyle, you might come from the streets. A&R's only look at you to see what they can get out of you, not all, but most, they want you to be their creation, that's why we ain't fuckin' wit' them.<ref name="Think">{{cite web | last = | first = | url = http://www.think.cz/issue/06/7.html | title = Enter the WU-TANG Clan - Interview by Aaron Kirtz at Think.cz | format = | work = | publisher =  | accessdate = October 17 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>}}

[[Image:ghostandgza.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Promotional photo of [[GZA]] and [[Ghostface Killah|"Ghostface Killah"]] for ''Enter the Wu-Tang'']]
RZA began collaborating with Dennis Coles, better known as [[Ghostface Killah]], another rapper from the [[Stapleton Projects]] apartment complex in [[Staten Island]]. The duo decided to create a hip hop group whose ethos would be a blend of "[[Eastern philosophy]] picked up from [[kung fu movies]], watered-down [[Nation of Islam]] preaching picked up on the New York streets, and comic books."<ref name="FirstSingle">{{cite web | last = | first = | url = http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/arts/books/documents/04646062.asp | title = Days of the Wu - The RZA looks inside the Clan
 | format = | work = | publisher =  | accessdate = October 16 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> In 1992, RZA and Ghostface joined forces with [[GZA]], Russell Jones (newly christened [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]]), and five other New York [[Master of Ceremonies#Adoption in popular culture|MC]]s to form Wu-Tang Clan. RZA assumed leadership of the group and was largely responsible for its artistic direction.

After some of the members' past experiences, Wu-Tang Clan was initially hesitant to accept a contract offer and demanded that each member retain solo recording rights. On the strength of the "Protect Ya Neck/Method Man" single, [[Loud Records]] and [[RCA]] acceded to their demands, paving the way for Wu-Tang Clan to release ''36 Chambers'' on those labels.

===Recording sessions===
''Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)'' was recorded at Firehouse Studio in [[New York City]] from 1992 to 1993. The album was produced, mixed, arranged, and programmed by [[RZA]], and was [[Master recording|mastered]] at [[The Hit Factory]] in New York City by Chris Gehringer.<ref name="Discogs">{{cite web | last = | first = | url = http://www.discogs.com/artist/Wu-Tang+Clan | title = Wu-Tang Clan Entry at Discogs.com | format = | work = | publisher = | accessdate = October 12 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> Because of an extremely limited budget, the group was only able to record in a small, inexpensive studio; with up to eight Wu-Tang members in the studio at once, the quarters were frequently crowded.<ref name="Exclaim">{{cite web | last = Cowie  | first = Del F. | url = http://www.exclaim.ca/index.asp?layid=22&csid=1&csid1=914 | title = Days of the Wu at Exclaim.ca | format = | work = | publisher =  | accessdate = 
November 6 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> To decide who appeared on each song, RZA forced the Wu-Tang rappers to [[Freestyle battle|battle]] with each other. This competition led to the track "Meth Vs. Chef", a battle between [[Method Man]] and [[Raekwon]] over the rights to rap over RZA's beat; this track was left off the Wu-Tang Clan's debut album but surfaced on Method Man's debut, ''[[Tical (album)|Tical]]''.<ref name="Exclaim">{{cite web | last = | first = | url = http://www.exclaim.ca/index.asp?layid=22&csid=1&csid1=914 | title = Days of the Wu
 | format = | work = | publisher =  | accessdate = 
November 6 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> The album's name, "36 Chambers", is taken from the 1978 [[China|Chinese]] [[martial arts film]] "Shao Lin san shi liu fang" (The 36th Chambers of Shaolin). <ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078243/</ref>.

==Music==
===Lyrical content===
''Enter the Wu Tang'' ushered in a new standard for hip hop at a time when hip hop music was dominated by the [[jazz rap|jazz-influenced]] styles of [[A Tribe Called Quest]], the [[Afrocentric]] viewpoints of [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], and the rising popularity of [[West Coast hip hop|West Coast]] [[gangsta rap]]. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described the album as possessing an aesthetic that was "low on hype and production values [and] high on the idea that indigence is a central part of blackness."<ref name="Wu">{{cite web | last = | first = | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/wutangclan/albums/album/129082/review/6209929/enter_the_wutang_36_chambers | title = Wu-Tang Clan: Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) | format = | work = | publisher = | accessdate = October 7 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> While the lyrical content on ''Enter the Wu-Tang'' generally varies from rapper to rapper, the basic themes are the same — urban life, martial arts movies, comic book references, and [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] — and the setting is invariably the harsh environment of New York City. The lyrics have a universally dark tone and seem at times to be simply aggressive cries. [[All Music Guide]] praises the lyricists for their originality and [[caustic humour|caustic humor]]: {{cquote|Some were outsized, theatrical personalities, others were cerebral storytellers and lyrical technicians, but each had his own distinctive style...Every track on ''Enter the Wu-Tang'' is packed with fresh, inventive rhymes, which are filled with martial arts metaphors, pop culture references (everything from Voltron to Lucky Charms cereal commercials to Barbra Streisand's "The Way We Were"), bizarre threats of violence, and a truly twisted sense of humor.<ref name="AllMusicGuide" />}}
 
With the exception of "Method Man" and [[GZA]]'s "Clan in da Front", every song features multiple rappers contributing verses of varying lengths.<ref name="Wu">{{cite web | last = | first = | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/wutangclan/albums/album/129082/review/6209929/enter_the_wutang_36_chambers | title = Wu-Tang Clan: Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) | format = | work = | publisher = | accessdate = October 7 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> The verses are essentially battle rhymes, mixed with humor and outsized tales of urban violence and drug use. There is some debate about whether the lyrics on ''36 Chambers'' are properly classified as [[gangsta rap]] or something else entirely.<ref name="ProudFlesh">{{cite web | last = Yew | first = Ben | url = http://www.proudfleshjournal.com/issue3/yew.htm | title = Retrospect for Hip-Hop: A Golden Age on Record? at ProudFleshJournal.com

All nine original Wu-Tang Clan members contribute vocals on ''Enter the Wu-Tang''. [[Masta Killa]] only appears on one track, contributing the last verse of "[[Da Mystery of Chessboxin']]", but all the other rappers appear on at least two songs. Method Man and Raekwon are the most prolific of the group, featured on eight tracks. Though the performers have widely differing techniques, the chemistry between them is a key ingredient of the album's success.<ref name="RapReviews">{{cite web | last = Juon | first = Steve | url = http://www.rapreviews.com/archive/BTTL_36chambers.html | title = Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) Review at RapReviews.com | format = | work = | publisher = | accessdate = November 25 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> [[Pitchfork Media]] asserts that "Half the charm is in the cast's idiosyncrasies: ODB's hovering sing-song, Raekwon's fake stutter, Ghostface's verbal tics, Method Man's hazy, dusted voice."<ref name="Pitchfork">{{cite web | last = | first = | url = http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/36737/Staff_List_Top_100_Albums_of_the_1990s/page_7 | title = Pitchfork Feature: Top 100 Albums of the 1990s at PitchforkMedia.com | format = | work = | publisher = | accessdate = December 14th | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>

===Production===
[[RZA]] produced ''Enter the Wu-Tang'' by creating sonic collages from classic soul [[music sampling|sample]]s and clips from [[martial arts]] movies such as ''[[Shaolin and Wu Tang]]''. He complimented the rappers' performances with "lean, menacing beats that evoked their gritty, urban surroundings more effectively than their words", according to Stephen Thomas Erlewine of All Music Guide.<ref name="AMG">{{cite web | last = Erlewine | first = Stephen Thomas | url = http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:knx1z82a2yvj | title = Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) (Japan) at All Music Guide | format = | work = | publisher = | accessdate = October 7 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> The use of soul samples and various esoteric clips, and the technique by which RZA employed them in his beats, was unique and largely unprecedented in hip hop.<ref name="Alchemist">{{cite web | last = | first = | url = http://www.superswell.com/samplelaw/quotes.html | title = Sampling Quotes at Superswell.com
 | format = | work = | publisher = | accessdate = November 7 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> 

The gritty sound of ''Enter the Wu-Tang'' is due, at least in part, to the use of cheap equipment to produce the album.<ref name="RapReviews">{{cite web | last = Juon | first = Steve | url = http://www.rapreviews.com/archive/BTTL_36chambers.html | title = Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)  at Rapreviews.com
 | format = | work = | publisher =  | accessdate = October 8 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> Many critics argue that this plays directly into the appealing "street" quality that makes the album a classic:

{{cquote|Because [RZA] didn’t have the best mixing or recording equipment, the album is wrought with a "dirty" quality – the drums have more bass and are more hard-hitting than they are crisp and clean; the samples have an eerie, almost haunting type of echo; and the vocals, because each member’s voice is already aggressive and gritty, perfectly match the production.<ref name="ProudFlesh">{{cite web | last = | first = | url = http://www.proudfleshjournal.com/issue3/yew.htm | title = Retrospect for Hip-Hop: A Golden Age on Record?
 | format = | work = | publisher = | accessdate = October 21 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>}}

Although [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]] is given co-production credit on "Da Mystery of Chessboxin'" and [[Method Man]] is co-credited for "[[Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing ta F' Wit]]", critics and admirers universally credit RZA with developing a "dusty yet digital production style [that] helped legitimize the use of more diverse sample sources to the hardcore New York rap massive, breaking away from [[James Brown]] based beats and embracing a style that turned the Underdog theme into the menacing coda for a group of underground terrorists."<ref name="Pitchfork">{{cite web | last = Pemberton  | first = Rolie | url = http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/36737/Staff_List_Top_100_Albums_of_the_1990s/page_7 | title = Pitchfork Feature: Top 100 Albums of the 1990s | format = | work = | publisher = | accessdate = December 14th | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>

"[[Protect Ya Neck]]" and "Tearz" were the first tracks recorded by the Wu-Tang Clan. "Protect Ya Neck" is a free-associative and braggadocious [[battle rap]] featuring eight of the nine Wu-Tang members, and "Tearz" tells stories of a boy getting shot, and another one who contracts [[HIV]] after having unprotected sex. They were independently released as the "Protect Ya Neck"/"After Laughter Comes Tears" single, which [[RZA]] financed by demanding $100 ([[USD]]) from each rapper who wanted a verse on the [[A-side and B-side|A-side]].<ref name="FirstSingle">{{cite web | last = | first = | url = http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/arts/books/documents/04646062.asp | title = Days of the Wu - The RZA looks inside the Clan

"Method Man" reached number 69 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and number 17 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Rap Tracks]] chart. "Method Man" gained significant airplay partly for its catchy refrain, which copies the refrain of [[Hall & Oates]]' "Method of Modern Love" ("The M-E-T-H-O-D...Man").

"[[C.R.E.A.M. (Cash Rules Everything Around Me)|C.R.E.A.M.]]", featuring [[Raekwon]] and [[Inspectah Deck]], was the second single from the album and the first new A-side to be released after the group signed with Loud/RCA. Its lyrics deal with the struggle of poverty and the desire to earn money by any means. It was the Wu-Tang Clan's most successful single, reaching number 60 on the ''Billboard Hot 100'' and number 8 on the Hot Rap Tracks chart. The single topped the [[Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales]] chart. ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' describes "C.R.E.A.M." as the standout track on ''36 Chambers''.<ref name="Blender">{{cite web | last = | first = | url = http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=126 | title = 500 CDs You Must Own: Hip-Hop at Blender.com | format = | work = | publisher = | accessdate = October 2 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>

"Can It Be All So Simple", featuring [[Ghostface Killah]] and Raekwon, was the third single. It failed to chart on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, but reached number 24 on the Hot Rap Tracks chart.

The group made music videos for the three A-sides and for "Method Man", "Da Mystery of Chessboxin'", and "Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing ta Fuck Wit". As the group's profile increased, the quality of their videos improved; though the "Protect Ya Neck" video resembled a home movie, later videos were directed by rising hip hop music video director [[Hype Williams]]. The videos received almost no airplay on [[MTV]], but were extremely popular on video-by-request channels such as [[The Box (TV Channel)|The Box]].<ref name="TheBox">{{cite web | last = Ward | first = Jacob | url = http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.02/newmedia.html?pg=7 | title = Where MTV Fears to Tread at Wired.com | format = | work = | publisher = | accessdate = December 27 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> [[Touré]] wrote in his 1993 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' review that "in Brooklyn, N.Y., right now and extending back a few months, the reigning fave is the Wu-Tang Clan, who are to the channel what [[Guns N' Roses]] are to MTV."<ref name="Wu">{{cite web | last = | first = | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/wutangclan/albums/album/129082/review/6209929/enter_the_wutang_36_chambers | title = Wu-Tang Clan: Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) | format = | work = | publisher = | accessdate = October 7 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>

==Reception==
===Initial===
''Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)'' received a mixed response from critics on its release. ''Rolling Stone'''s review was decidedly ambivalent, praising the album's sound, but noting that "Wu-Tang...are more ciphers than masterful creations.

In naming ''Enter the Wu-Tang'' one of the 50 best albums of the 1990s, [[Pitchfork Media]] summed up the album's critical recognition: 

{{cquote|This is the sound of accidental fame. Something as unique and unusual as this record isn't supposed to find itself at the height of commercial viability; it's supposed to smolder underground, hidden from the view of mainstream America, who surely would not be ready for such a challenge. But America was ready, in part because this one challenged convention, not listeners. Sure, its sloppy drum programming, bizarre song structures, and unpolished sound quality disturbed commercial rap purists, but the talent was so inherent and obvious, and the charisma so undeniable, that it propelled the Wu-Tang Clan to the height of the rap game, and today stands not just as the hip-hop classic that introduced the concept of obscure thematic characters (each member's name references old kung-fu movies), but also bridged the gap between traditional old-school sensibilities and the technical lyricism of today.<ref name="Pitchfork">{{cite web | last = | first = | url = http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/36737/Staff_List_Top_100_Albums_of_the_1990s/page_7 | title = Pitchfork Feature: Top 100 Albums of the 1990s | format = | work = | publisher = | accessdate = December 14th | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>}}

''Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)'' is one of the most celebrated and [[seminal work|influential]] albums in [[History of hip hop music|hip hop history]].<ref name="ProudFlesh">{{cite web | last = Yew | first = Ben | url = http://www.proudfleshjournal.com/issue3/yew.htm | title = Retrospect for Hip-Hop: A Golden Age on Record? at ProudFleshJournal.com | format = | work = | publisher = | accessdate = October 21 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> Adam Heimlich of the ''[[New York Press]]'' considers the album a touchstone of [[hardcore hip-hop]], a gritty, stripped-down, dark and violent sub-genre of hip hop and the signature sound of [[New York City]]'s rap scene during the mid-1990s. He writes that, "the Wu-Tang Clan...all but invented 90s New York rap, back when the notion of an East Coast gangsta still meant [[Schoolly D]] or [[Kool G. Rap]]....[They] designed the manner and style in which New York artists would address what [[Snoop Dogg|Snoop]] and [[Dr. Dre|Dre]] had made rap’s hottest topics: drugs and violence."<ref name="heimlich">{{cite web| last = Heimlich | first = Adam | url = http://www.nypress.com/15/4/news&columns/feature.cfm | title = 2002, Hiphop's Year One: Nas, Mobb Deep and Wu-Tang Clan Face 9/11 | format = Online Article Column | work = The [[New York Press]]: Volume 15,  Issue 4 | publisher = | accessdate = April 1 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> A new generation of New York rappers, many of them inspired by the Wu-Tang Clan's example, released a flurry of classic albums that later became known as the [[East Coast hip hop#The East Coast Renaissance|East Coast Renaissance]]. [[All Music Guide]] indicates that [[Nas]]'s ''[[Illmatic]]'', [[The Notorious B.I.G.]]'s ''[[Ready to Die]]'', [[Mobb Deep]]'s ''[[The Infamous]]'', and [[Jay-Z]]'s ''[[Reasonable Doubt]]'' are among the records of this era that reflected the Wu-Tang Clan's influence.<ref name="AllMusicGuide">{{cite web | last = Huey | first = Steve | url = http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:ogd2vwdta9rk | title = Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) Review at All Music Guide | format = | work = | publisher = | accessdate = October 1 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>

At the time of the album's release, mainstream hip hop was dominated by [[West Coast hip hop]]. ''Enter the Wu Tang'' (along with the critically acclaimed ''Illmatic'' and the commercial success of ''Ready to Die'') was able to shift the emphasis away from the melodious, [[synthesizer]]-driven [[G-funk]] and restore interest into the East Coast hip hop scene. According to one columnist, "When ''Enter the Wu-Tang: The 36 Chambers'' first graced the pages of rap lore in 1993, [[Dr. Dre]]'s funk-filled, West Coast gangster rap dominated the business. Though this initial dominance was difficult to overcome, Wu-Tang still managed to carve out a piece of rap history."<ref name="ProudFlesh">{{cite web | last = | first = | url = http://www.proudfleshjournal.com/issue3/yew.htm | title = Retrospect for Hip-Hop: A Golden Age on Record?
 | format = | work = | publisher = | accessdate = October 21 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>

===Production===
[[RZA]]'s production on Wu-Tang Clan's debut album had a profound and significant influence on subsequent hip hop producers. Blackfilm.com asserts that ''Enter the Wu-Tang'''s production formula "transformed the sound of underground rap into mainstream formula, and virtually changed the face of contemporary music as popsters once knew it."<ref name="BlackFilm">{{cite web | last = | first = | url = http://www.blackfilm.com/20040514/features/rza.shtml | title = Coffee and Cigarettes: An Interview with RZA at Blackfilm.com | format = | work = | publisher = | accessdate = November 17 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> Many successful rap producers have admitted to the influence of RZA's beats on their own production efforts. [[9th Wonder]], a producer and former member of [[Little Brother]], is one of many whose vocal sampling styles are inspired by RZA.<ref name="9thWonder">{{cite web | last = | first = | url = http://remixmag.com/artists/remix_little_feat/ | title = Little Feat: An Interview With 9th Wonder at RemixMag.com  | format = | work = | publisher = | accessdate = November 7 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> The album's reliance on soul music samples was novel at the time, but 21st century producers such as [[The Alchemist (producer)|The Alchemist]], [[Kanye West]] and [[Just Blaze]] now rely on this technique.<ref name="Alchemist">{{cite web | last = | first = | url = http://www.superswell.com/samplelaw/quotes.html | title = Sampling Quotes at Superswell.com
 | format = | work = | publisher = | accessdate = November 7 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> The production on two [[Mobb Deep]] albums, ''[[The Infamous]]'' and ''[[Hell on Earth (album)|Hell on Earth]]'', are "indebted"<ref name="Theinfamous">{{cite web | last = Huey | first = Steve | url = http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:1c821vkozzua | title = The Infamous at All Music Guide | format = | work = | publisher = | accessdate = January 1 | accessyear = 2007}}</ref><ref name="Hellonearth">{{cite web | last = Huey | first = Steve | url = http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&token=&sql=10:3n881vaozzua | title = Hell on Earth at All Music Guide | format = | work = | publisher = | accessdate = January 1 | accessyear = 2007}}</ref> to RZA's early production with Wu-Tang Clan.

The vocals from tracks on ''36 Chambers'' have been extensively sampled by other artists and producers. [[Raekwon]] and [[Inspectah Deck]]'s vocals from "C.R.E.A.M." have been sampled on [[Masta Ace]]'s "Maintain" and [[Reflection Eternal]]'s "Good Mourning", respectively. [[Common (rapper)|Common]]'s "Nuthin' to Do" samples vocals from [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]] on "Protect Ya Neck". [[The Pharcyde]]'s "Devil Music" samples vocals from [[U-God]] on "Da Mystery of Chessboxin'".

===Subsequent work by Wu-Tang Clan artists===
Following the success of ''Enter the Wu-Tang'', the individual members of the group negotiated and signed solo contracts with a variety of different labels: [[Method Man]] signed with [[Def Jam]], Ol' Dirty Bastard with [[Elektra Records]], [[GZA]] with [[Geffen Records]], and [[Ghostface Killah]] with [[Epic Records]]. This expansion across the music industry was an element of RZA's plan for industry-wide domination, wherein "All Wu releases are deemed to be 50 percent partnerships with Wu-Tang Productions and each Wu member with solo deal must contribute 20 percent of their earnings back to Wu-Tang Productions, a fund for all Wu members."<ref name="Exclaim">{{cite web | last = Cowie | first = Del | url = http://www.exclaim.ca/index.asp?layid=22&csid=1&csid1=914 | title = Days of the Wu at Exclaim.ca
 | format = | work = | publisher =  | accessdate = 
November 6 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> RZA's plan proved successful: every member of the Wu-Tang Clan has released a solo record. 

Wu-Tang Clan have produced three subsequent group albums since ''Enter the Wu-Tang'', including ''[[Wu-Tang Forever]]'', which is certified as a quadruple platinum record.<ref name="RIAA">{{cite web | last = | first = | url = http://www.riaa.com/gp/database/search_results.asp | title = Gold and Platinum Database Search at RIAA.com | format =  | work = | publisher = | accessdate = October 15 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> None of the subsequent Wu-Tang Clan albums have garnered the critical accolades that their debut was accorded.<ref name="UWire">{{cite web| last = Kurtz | first = Mike | url = http://www.uwire.com/content/topae012402002.html | title = Nas, Wu-Tang Clan show growth, change with new albums at U-Wire.com | format = | work = | publisher = | accessdate = December 12 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>

Several songs from the ''36 Chambers'' sessions later resurfaced on other Wu-Tang Clan releases. Raekwon's debut album, ''[[Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...]]'' features a remix of "[[Can It Be All So Simple]]". Method Man's debut album, ''[[Tical (album)|Tical]]'', contains a remix of "[[Method Man (song)|Method Man]]" as a bonus track.  Later albums by Wu-Tang Clan affiliates refer to ''Enter the Wu-Tang'' in their titles: Ol' Dirty Bastard's ''[[Return to the 36 Chambers]]'' and the live release, ''[[Disciples of the 36 Chambers: Chapter 1]]''.
