==Background==
''Avatar: The Last Airbender'' is co-created and produced by [[Michael Dante DiMartino]] and [[Bryan Konietzko]] at Nickelodeon Animation Studios in [[Burbank, California]].
According to co-creator Bryan Konietzko, the concept of the program was initially conceived in Spring 2002, when he took an old sketch of his—a balding, middle-aged man—and reimagined the character as a child. Bryan then drew the character herding bison in the sky. At the time, Mike DiMartino was studying a documentary about explorers who were trapped in the [[South Pole]]. Konietzko described their early development of the concept: {{quote|We thought, "There's an air guy along with these water people trapped in a snowy wasteland... and maybe some fire people are pressing down on them..."|Bryan Konietzko|<ref name="NickMagInterview1">{{citation|last=DiMartino|first=Michael Dante|author-link=Michael Dante DiMartino|last2=Konietzko|first2=Bryan|author2-link=Bryan Konietzko|title=In Their Elements|newspaper=Nickelodeon Magazine|pages=6|year=2006|date=Winter 2006|url=http://www.musogato.com/avatar/magazine/avatarmag1_scan08.jpg}}</ref>}} The co-creators proceeded to successfully pitch the idea to Nickelodeon [[VP]] and [[executive producer]] Eric Coleman just two weeks later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mag.awn.com/index.php?ltype=pageone&article_no=3428|title=It's Elementary -- Avatar: The Last Airbender}}</ref>

While it was originally set to premiere in November 2004, the first episode of ''Avatar'' aired in February 2005. Following the conclusion of the first season of ''Avatar'', Nickelodeon promptly ordered a second twenty-episode season that premiered on [[March 17]], [[2006]], and concluded on [[December 1]].<ref name="secondseason"/> The third season began on [[September 21]], [[2007]] and will feature twenty-one episodes rather than the usual twenty.<ref name="as_S3airdate" /> The final four episodes will be packaged as a two-hour movie.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avatarspirit.net/index.php#517|title=Mike & Bryan Are Coming to New York Comic Con}}</ref>

===Premise===
[[Image:Avatar world map.jpg|left|thumb|250px|A map of the four nations. The characters at the top, 群雄四分, mean "the heroes divide [the world or the country or the land] in four." The characters of the four lands are 水善 (Water Peaceful), 土强 (Earth Strong), 火烈 (Fire Fierce), and 气和 (Air Harmony). The phrase at the bottom, 天下一匡, reads "correct all things under heaven." The "correct things" phrase, with roots of the Confucian analect phrase 一匡天下, refers to reunification.]]
''Avatar: The Last Airbender'' takes place in a fantasy world, home to humans, fantastic animals, and supernatural spirits. Human civilization is divided into four nations—the [[Water Tribe]]s, the [[Earth Kingdom]], the [[Air Nomads]], and the [[Fire Nation]]. Within each nation exists an order called "Benders" who have the ability to manipulate their native [[classical element|element]]. These Bending arts combine a certain style of martial arts and elemental [[mysticism]]. The Bending types are [[Waterbender|Waterbending]], [[Earthbender|Earthbending]], [[Firebender|Firebending]], and [[Airbender|Airbending]].<ref name="avatar2/index.jhtml">{{cite web | url = http://www.nick.com/shows/avatar/index.jhtml | title = Nickelodeon's Official Avatar: The Last Airbender Flash Site | accessdate = 2006-12-02 | publisher = Nick.com}}</ref>

In each generation of the show's internal universe, one person is capable of Bending all four elements; this being is referred to in the show as the Avatar, the spirit of the planet manifested in human form. When the current Avatar dies, they are [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] into a baby native in the next of the four nations in the Avatar Cycle, which parallels the seasons: winter for water, spring for earth, summer for fire, and autumn for air.<ref name="Southern"/> While legend holds that the Avatar must master the elements in order, starting with their native element, this can sometimes be compromised when the situation requires it. Learning to bend the element opposite one's native element is extremely difficult because opposing Bending arts are based on opposing fighting styles and disciplines. [[Firebending]] and [[Waterbending]] are opposites, as are [[Earthbending]] and [[Airbending]].<ref name="LearnEarthbending">{{cite episode | title = Bitter Work | episodelink = Bitter Work | series = Avatar: The Last Airbender| network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2006-06-02 | season = 2 (Book 2) | number = 9}}</ref>

The Avatar also possesses a unique power that resides within them, called the [[Avatar State]]. This is a [[defence mechanism]] that empowers the Avatar with the knowledge and abilities of all the past Avatars. When an Avatar enters the Avatar state, their eyes and tattoos begin to glow. If an Avatar is killed in the Avatar State, then the reincarnation cycle will be broken, and the Avatar cycle will end.<ref name="AvatarState">{{cite episode | title = The Avatar State | episodelink = The Avatar State | series = Avatar: The Last Airbender | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2006-03-17 | season = 2 (Book 2) | number = 21}}</ref>

Through the ages, countless incarnations of the Avatar have served to keep the four nations in harmony and maintain world order.<ref name="avatar2/index.jhtml"/> The Avatar also serves as the bridge between the physical world and the [[Spirit World (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|Spirit World]]<ref name="SpiritWorld">{{cite episode | title = The Spirit World | episodelink = The Spirit World (Winter Solstice, Part 1) | series = Avatar: The Last Airbender | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2005-04-08 | season = 1 (Book 1) | number = 7}}</ref>

===Plot synopsis===
{{main|List of Avatar: The Last Airbender episodes}}
A century prior to the series' opening, [[Aang]], a 12-year-old Airbender of the Air Nomads' [[Air Nomads#Southern Air Temple|Southern Air Temple]], learned from the elder monks that he was the Avatar. Usually, the Avatar is told of his or her true identity after turning sixteen; however, the monks feared that a war between the four nations was on the horizon and that soon the Avatar would be required to maintain balance and order in the world. Shortly thereafter, the monks decreed that Aang would be separated from his guardian, [[List of Avatar: The Last Airbender minor recurring characters#Monk Gyatso|Monk Gyatso]], and sent to the [[Air Nomads#Eastern Air Temple|Eastern Air Temple]] to complete his training.

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Human Popsicle.png|thumb|200px|right|Sokka and Katara make a discovery]] -->
Confused, frightened, and overwhelmed by these recent events and his new responsibilities as the Avatar, Aang fled from his home on his [[List of Avatar: The Last Airbender creatures#Flying Bison|flying bison]], [[Appa]]. While traveling over frigid southern ocean waters, a sudden storm caused Appa to plunge deep into the sea. Threatened with drowning, Aang unconsciously entered the Avatar State, and used Airbending and Waterbending to encase himself and Appa in an ice bubble, forcing them into a state of [[suspended animation]]. The ocean currents propelled the bubble into the icy waters surrounding the South Pole, where it could not thaw, and instead formed into an [[iceberg]]. <ref name="Southern">{{cite episode | title = The Southern Air Temple | episodelink = The Southern Air Temple | series = Avatar: The Last Airbender | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2005-02-25 | season = 1 (Book 1) | number = 3}}</ref>

The series opens one hundred years later, with the [[Fire Nation]] on the brink of victory in its imperialist war. All Air Nomads are believed dead. The Water Tribes are in crisis&nbsp;— the Southern Water Tribe's warriors have left to wage war, leaving their home defenseless, while the Northern Water Tribe, though largely intact, is continually on the defensive.<ref>{{cite episode | title = The Boy in the Iceberg | episodelink = The Boy in the Iceberg | series = Avatar: The Last Airbender | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2005-02-21 | season = 1 (Book 1)|number = 1}}</ref> The vast [[Earth Kingdom]] is now the only true barrier to the Fire Nation's world conquest, but as the Fire Nation continues to encroach on its borders and conquer its territories, hopes of victory grow bleaker with each passing year.

Two teenage siblings from the Southern Water Tribe&nbsp;— [[Katara]], an inexperienced Waterbender, and her brother, [[Sokka]], a warrior and caretaker of the tribe&nbsp;— discover and free Aang and Appa from the iceberg. Aang soon discovers to his horror that, during his absence, a century-long war has been waged. The very year he vanished, Fire Lord Sozin, then-ruler of the Fire Nation, took advantage of both the Avatar's absence and the [[Firebender|Firebending]]-enhancing powers of a passing [[comet]] (later named "Sozin's Comet" in his honor) to launch a war on the other nations.<ref name="Roku">{{cite episode | title = Avatar Roku | episodelink = Avatar Roku (Winter Solstice, Part 2) | series = Avatar: The Last Airbender | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2005-04-15 | season = 1 (Book 1)|number = 8}}</ref> To Aang's shock and disbelief, the Fire Nation's opening gambit had been a [[genocide|genocidal]] assault on the Air Nomads. The Air Temples were stormed and the Airbenders slaughtered in the Fire Nation's effort to break the Avatar Cycle, leaving Aang as the last known Airbender in existence.<ref name="Southern"/>

As the Avatar, Aang's duty is to restore harmony and peace to the four nations. Along with his newly discovered friends Katara and Sokka, his flying bison Appa and his [[List of Avatar: The Last Airbender creatures#Winged Lemur|winged lemur]] [[List of Avatar: The Last Airbender major secondary characters#Momo|Momo]], and later the blind Earthbender [[Toph]], Aang travels the world to master all four elements. During his quest, he must constantly avoid being captured by the banished [[Zuko|Prince Zuko]] and, later, Zuko's deceptive sister, [[Azula|Princess Azula]].

Although normally years of disciplined training are required to master a single Bending art, Aang must become a master of all four and defeat [[List of Avatar: The Last Airbender major secondary characters#Fire Lord Ozai|Fire Lord Ozai]] by summer's end, when the return of Sozin's Comet will give the Firebenders the power to win the war. If these events come to pass, not even the Avatar will possess the ability to restore balance to the world.<ref name="Roku"/>

''Avatar'' has been praised for its depth of [[characterization]], from its "marvelously flawed" heroes to its sympathetic villains.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.toonzone.net/article.php?ID=13115 | title = Toon Zone Description and Review on Season 1 DVD | accessdate = 2006-12-02 | author = Ed Liu |date=2006-10-28 | publisher = Toon Zone}}</ref>

===Main characters===
[[Image:Avatar-book 1 Chapters 1 And 2 0003.jpg|100px|right|thumb|Aang]]
'''[[Aang]]'''&nbsp;([[Mitchel Musso]] in the [[Pilot (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|unaired pilot]], [[Zach Tyler Eisen]]&nbsp;onwards) is the fun-loving, 12-year-old (chronologically 112-year-old) [[protagonist]]  of the series. He is the current incarnation of the Avatar, the spirit of the planet manifested in human form. As the Avatar, Aang must master all four elements to bring peace to the world and balance to the four Nations.<ref name="TheAvatarReturns">{{cite episode | title = The Avatar Returns | episodelink = The Avatar Returns | series = Avatar: The Last Airbender | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2005-02-21 | season = 1 (Book 1) | number = 2}}</ref> A reluctant hero, Aang openly admits that he would rather be searching for adventure and making new friends than saving the world. Aang's energetic nature, childish naïvete and innate distractibility render him mildly oblivious to both the world around him and the feelings of others. However, over the course of the series, Aang's experiences gradually mature him as he grows into his role as Avatar.

[[Image:Katara.png|100px|left|thumb|Katara]]
'''[[Katara]]'''&nbsp;([[Mae Whitman]]) is a 14 year old Waterbender of the Southern Water Tribe. As a result of targeted Fire Nation raids, she is the only remaining Waterbender in the South Pole. Katara discovers and frees Aang, and with her older brother Sokka, accompanies him on his quest to defeat the Fire Lord and bring peace to the war-torn nations. Katara is kind, responsible and particularly motherly, a trait she developed after her own mother was killed in a Fire Nation attack. Though an apt leader,<ref name="TheDesert">{{cite episode | title = The Desert | episodelink = The Desert | series = Avatar: The Last Airbender | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2006-07-14 | season = 2 (Book 2) | number = 11}}</ref> she can be overbearing and stubborn.<ref name="TheChase">{{cite episode | title = The Chase| episodelink = The Chase (Avatar: The Last Airbender) | series = Avatar: The Last Airbender | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2006-06-02 | season = 2 (Book 2) | number = 9}}</ref> In spite of her kind nature, she also has a temper, which, when combined with her idealism and impressive waterbending skills, can be quite destructive. 

[[Image:Sokka the Thinker.png|100px|right|thumb|Sokka]]
'''[[Sokka]]'''&nbsp;([[Jack DeSena]]) is a 15-year-old warrior of the Southern Water Tribe who, with his younger sister Katara, accompanies Aang on his quest to defeat the Fire Lord.  The joker of the group, Sokka describes himself as "meat-loving" and "sarcastic."<ref name="LearnEarthbending"/> Unlike his companions, Sokka cannot bend an element. However, the series frequently grants him opportunities to demonstrate  his true gifts: ingenuity and use of weapons. He takes great pride in his mental and [[physical strength]], though it is often overshadowed by others' ability to bend. He is extremely clever, relying on science where the mystical and martial arts elude him (thus, giving him great advantage as strategist), though his immature manner often causes others to underestimate his intellect. 

[[Image:Toph ep26.png|100px|left|thumb|Toph]]
'''[[Toph|Toph Bei Fong]]'''&nbsp;([[Jessie Flower]]) is a 12-year-old, blind Earthbender who leaves her wealthy family and home to join Aang on his quest in order to teach him earthbending. Though blind, Toph "sees" with Earthbending, feeling vibrations in the ground through the soles of her feet. Using this method, she eventually learns how to bend metal, a knowledge which may be unique to her. Toph has lived a largely sheltered life due to overprotective parents, which makes her somewhat selfish, sarcastic, and, at times, bitter and arrogant. She does not hesitate to speak her mind and is bluntly truthful. With the presence of friends, Toph gradually becomes less abrasive, and learns what it means to be part of a team.

[[Image:Zuko Season2.png|100px|right|thumb|Prince Zuko]]
'''[[Zuko]]'''&nbsp;([[Dante Basco]]) is the exiled 16-year-old prince of the Fire Nation and original primary [[antagonist]] of the series. Zuko was obsessed with capturing the Avatar in his quest to restore his honor and redeem himself in the eyes of his father, [[List of Avatar: The Last Airbender major secondary characters#Fire Lord Ozai|Fire Lord Ozai]], who deems him a complete failure. The most defining aspect of his appearance is the scar over his left eye, which he received during a forced [[Firebending#Agni Kai|Agni Kai]] with Ozai.<ref name="TheStorm">{{cite episode | title = The Storm | episodelink = The Storm (Avatar: The Last Airbender) | series = Avatar: The Last Airbender | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2005-06-03 | season = 1 (Book 1) | number = 12}}</ref> As a result of his traumatic life, including the disappearance of his beloved mother Ursa, Zuko is temperamental, bitter, and cold to others. However, he is positively influenced by both the presence of his Uncle Iroh and his time in exile. Over time, Zuko struggles to deal with his anger, self-pity, and familial relationships, while growing sympathetic to the peoples his nation has terrorized.

[[Image:AzulaHiRes.png|100px|left|thumb|Princess Azula]]
'''[[Azula]]'''&nbsp;([[Grey DeLisle]]) is the 14 year-old-princess of the Fire Nation, Zuko's younger sister, and one of the major [[antagonists]] of the series. Cruel and self-centered since her early youth, Azula is manipulative, sadistic and a self-admitted monster. She has no qualms about bullying and threatening her relatives or her underlings, reserving any familial loyalty for her father, who favors her. As a ruthless firebending prodigy, and one of the few Firebenders shown to generate lightning, Azula is a dangerous opponent. <ref name="AvatarState"/> 

[[Image:Iroh ID BitterWork.png|100px|right|thumb|General Iroh]]
'''[[Iroh]]'''&nbsp;([[Mako (actor)|Mako]] in seasons 1 and 2, [[Greg Baldwin]]&nbsp;onwards) is a retired Fire Nation general and Prince Zuko's uncle. Iroh is the older brother of Fire Lord Ozai and was the original [[heir apparent|heir to the throne ]] of the Fire Nation.<ref name="ZukoAlone">{{cite episode | title = Zuko Alone | episodelink = Zuko Alone | series = Avatar: The Last Airbender | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2006-05-12 | season = 2 (Book 2) | number = 7}}</ref> A powerful Firebender of great renown and respect (he is known as the ''Dragon of the West''), he looks upon Zuko as a son more than as a nephew, especially after the loss of his own son, [[List of Avatar: The Last Airbender minor recurring characters#Lu Ten|Lu Ten]]. On the surface, Iroh is a cheerful and kind old man whose hobbies include drinking tea, playing [[Pai Sho]], and singing. But underneath the exterior, remains a competent warrior and devoted surrogate parent. Much older, more powerful and more experienced than the other [[protagonist|main characters]], Iroh chooses to take a less active role in the affairs of the series, acting as more of a mentor and guide to Zuko and nearly everyone he meets.

==Influences==
===Cultural references===
''Avatar'' is notable for borrowing extensively from [[Art of East Asia|Asian art]] and mythology to create a fully realized [[fictional universe]]. Apart from its [[anime]]-inspired character designs, ''Avatar'' also draws on a mix of [[China|Chinese]], [[Japan]]ese, [[Mongolia]]n, [[Korea]]n, [[Aztec]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]]n, [[India (disambiguation)|Indian]], [[Polynesia]]n and [[Tibet]]an [[philosophy]], [[religion]], [[language]], [[clothing]], [[martial arts]], [[culture]] and [[architecture]]. In addition, the show's [[Water Tribe]] is heavily influenced by [[Inuit]] culture.

====Avatar====
The term "[[Avatar]]" comes from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''Avatāra'', ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]: अवतार), which means "descent." In [[Hindu mythology]], gods often manifest themselves into Avatars to restore balance on earth after a period of great evil. The [[Chinese character]]s appearing above the word "Avatar" in the show's opening mean "the divine medium who has descended upon the mortal world."<ref name="calligraphy.html">{{cite web | url = http://www.musogato.com/avatar/calligraphy.html | title = Calligraphy Writing In Avatar | accessdate = 2006-12-02 | author = KTChong | publisher = Distant Horizon}}</ref>

When [[Aang]] was a child, he unknowingly revealed that he was the Avatar when he chose four toys out of thousands that symbolized each of the main elements. These four toys were the same ones that past Avatars had chosen for generations when they were children, revealing that Aang was the [[reincarnation]] of the Avatar. There is a similar test a child must pass in order to be recognized as the reincarnation of a [[Tulku]] [[Lama]] in [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. According to the book ''Magic and Mystery in Tibet'' by [[Alexandra David-Neel]], "a number of objects such as [[rosary|rosaries]], ritualistic implements, books, tea-cups, etc., are placed together, and the child must pick out those which belonged to the late ''tulku'', thus showing that he recognizes the things which were ''theirs'' in their previous life."<ref>David-Neel, Alexandra. ''Magic and Mystery in Tibet''. New York: Dover Publications, Inc., 1971 (ISBN 0-486-22682-4)</ref> Avatar's official site states "the successor is expected to show signs of continuity with the previous Avatar, such as being born within a week of the death."<ref name="avatar2/index.jhtml"/>

====Elements====
<!-- Do NOT mention any specific classical ideology as the influential source unless you have verifiable proof. No "missing fifth element."-->
''Avatar'' draws on four [[classical elements]] for its bending arts (rather than the [[Wu Xing|5 Classical Chinese Elements]]): [[Water (classical element)|Water]], [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]] and [[Air (classical element)|Air]]. Although each has its own variation, most [[ancient philosophy|ancient philosophies]] incorporate these four elements in some way, including the classical [[Tattva|Hindu]], [[Mahābhūta|Buddhist]], [[Classical elements#Classical elements in Greece|Greek]] and [[Five elements (Japanese philosophy)|Japanese]] elemental traditions.
<!-- Please DO NOT mention the 4 Classical Chinese Elements. We KNOW, they're different. Several other philosophies are too. None of them, and neither the Chinese elements, are used in the show, so mentioning any of them is of NO importance. Except to provide relevant information and greater understanding of Chinese culture.-->

In the show’s opening, each element is accompanied by 2 Chinese characters&nbsp;— an ancient Chinese [[seal script]] character of the element on the left, along with a more modern Chinese character of the corresponding attribute on the right:
* [[Water (classical element)|Water]] (水) is associated with "[[Image:Shan.svg|20px]]" ({{zh-cp|c=善|p=shàn}}), which means "benevolent" or "adaptive."
* [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]] (土) is associated with "[[Image:Qiang.svg|20px]]" ({{zh-tsp|t=強|s=强|p=qiáng}}), which means "strong."
* [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]] (火) is associated with "[[Image:Lie.svg|20px]]" ({{zh-cp|c=烈|p=liè}}), which means "intense" or "ferocious."
* [[Air (classical element)|Air]] (气) is associated with "[[Image:He (character).svg|20px]]" ({{zh-cp|c=和|p=hé}}), which means "peaceful" or "harmonious".<ref name="cally">{{cite web | url = http://www.musogato.com/avatar/calligraphy.html | title = Distant Horizon: Avatar Calligraphy | accessdate = 2006-12-09 }}</ref>
<!-- Please do not re-add information about Plantbending and Metalbending, in both cases it was specifically mentioned that the bender was not bending either the plant or the metal, but simply the water and the earth within them. -->

===Western culture===
====Cinema and books====
Films series such as ''[[Star Wars]]'', along with book series such as ''[[Harry Potter]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' were a heavy influence when it came to developing the story of ''Avatar'', as the creators wanted to tell their own epic Legend & Lore story.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://tv.ign.com/articles/818/818284p1.html | title = IGN: Interview: Avatar's Bryan Konietzko and Michael Dante DiMartino | accessdate = 2007-09-24|date=2007-09-06 | publisher = IGN.com}}</ref>

===Asian culture===
====Calligraphy====
<!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:ATLA Calligraphy.png|thumb|An example of Chinese calligraphy]] -->
[[Chinese character]]s done in traditional [[East Asian calligraphy]] styles are used for nearly all the writing that appears in ''Avatar''. For each instance of calligraphy, an appropriate style is used, ranging from the [[seal script]] (more archaic) to the [[clerical script]].<ref name="calligraphy.html"/> The show employs calligrapher Siu-Leung Lee as a consultant and translator. <ref name="nytimes"/>

====Fighting styles====
The fighting choreography of ''Avatar'' draws from martial arts, and the fighting styles and weaponry are based on [[Chinese martial arts]], with each bending art corresponding to a certain real-world style or styles. The creators use [[Tai Chi Chuan|Tai Chi]] for [[Waterbender|waterbending]], [[Hung Gar]] for [[Earthbender|earthbending]] (although [[Toph]] employs a Chu Gar [[Southern Praying Mantis (martial art)|Southern Praying Mantis]] style),<ref name="con">[http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/con_reports.php?id=3 San Diego Comicon 2006 panel question and answer part 2] - Avatarspirit.net</ref> [[Northern Shaolin]] for [[Firebender|firebending]], and [[Baguazhang|Bagua]] for [[Airbender|airbending]].<ref name="avatar2/index.jhtml"/> The show employs [[Sifu]] Kisu of the Harmonious Fist Chinese Athletic Association as a martial arts consultant.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.harmoniousfist.com/ | title = The National Shaolin Information Resource | accessdate = 2006-12-02 | publisher = The Harmonious Fist Chinese Athletic Association}}</ref>

Each fighting style was chosen to represent the element it projected:
* Yang Style [[Tai Chi]] creates flowing energy, and fluid movements to represent water, turning an opponent's force against them. The Waterbenders find their offense in a strong defense, using the principles of energy in Tai Chi to redirect force, rather than meet it head on.
* [[Hung Gar]] was chosen for its firmly rooted stances, linear patterns, and powerful strikes to represent the solid nature of the earth. The martial art is based on the movements of animals, particularly the tiger, which represents Hard Power, and the crane, which represents Soft Power.
** Chu Gar [[Southern Praying Mantis]] has distinguishing movements and unique footwork that are employed by [[Toph Bei Fong]] to complement her blindness, giving her an anomalous (yet effective) style of Earthbending.<ref name="con"/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/interviews.php?id=8 | title = Interview with Sifu Kisu part 1 | accessdate = 2007-01-20 | author = Acastus | publisher = Avatarspirit.net |date=2006-10-05}}</ref>
* [[Northern Shaolin]] Long Fist uses fast, aggressive attacks and techniques, making it the perfect candidate to mimic the power of fire. The strong kicks and jabs of the style, and the speed with which they are executed were meant to replicate the ferocity with which fire spreads and burns. In comparison to others, the style does not employ extensive defensive movements.
* [[Baguazhang|Bagua's]] erratic, circular movements were chosen to represent air's unpredictability and cyclical motion. [[Centrifugal]] force plays a vital role in generating power in bagua, and the nearly constant circular movement creates angles between the fighters, making it easier for the bagua practitioner to defend and attack.<ref>Dan Miller, [http://www.pa-kua.com/fyi27/fyib27.htm "Advanced Circle Walking: Training to Fight"], ''Pa Kua Chang Journal'', 1994. Retrieved  02-15-2008</ref> <ref>[[Tim Cartmell]], [http://www.shenwu.com/bagua.htm An Introduction to Ba Gua Zhang]. Retrieved  02-15-2008</ref>
The flow of [[Qi|chi]] is the engine behind the bending arts. Benders require chi to flow from the breath as form of energy derived from breathing and oxygenation, and then extend that energy past their body to manipulate or manifest their element. This chi is stored in the abdomen of the bender, known among martial artists as the [[Dantian]].{{Fact|date=April 2008}} "Jing({{zh-tsp|t=勁|s=劲|p=jìng}}), it's a choice of how you direct your energy"<ref name="jing">Quote taken directly from King Bumi in the third episode of the shows second season.</ref>There is positive jing and negative jing, representing attacking and retreating respectively.<ref name="2jing">"There is negative jing when you're attacking, and negative jing when you're retreating" - Spoken by Aang in the third episode of the shows second season.</ref> A third jing is neutral jing, which is when you show patience.<ref name="3jing">"Neutral jing... involves listening and waiting for the right moment to strike." - Spoken by King Bumi in the third episode of the shows second season.</ref>

The ability to bend stems from a compound of genetics and spirituality. As stated by the creators, all Air Nomads are benders as a result of their small population and increased spirituality in comparison to other nations. <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.avatarspirit.com/con_reports.php?id=2 | title = Pacific Media Expo | accessdate = 2006-12-02 | author = Gowa-Chan | publisher = AvatarSpirit.com}}</ref>{{dead link|date=April 2008}} <!-- Do NOT add anything about genetics unless you have a verifiable source. While many support a genetic involvement, there is nothing official on it as of yet. Until then, feel free to discuss this on the "Discussion" page. -->

===Asian film===
Asian cinema had a profound effect on the utilization of the choreographed martial art bending moves. ''Avatar'' creators Bryan Konietzko and Michael Dante DiMartino stated the particular influence in a magazine interview:
{{quote|Asian cinema is really good at action comedy. ''[[Shaolin Soccer]]'' is one of our favorite movies. It has tons of fantastic action and lots of funny moments. Some of the effects provided inspiration for how bending moves might look on the show."<ref name = "musogato_elements">{{cite web|url=http://www.musogato.com/avatar/magazine/avatarmag1_scan08.jpg|title="In Their Elements." (September 2006) ''Nick Mag Presents'', p. 6}}</ref>}}

===Anime===
''Avatar'' is not considered an [[anime]] because of its American origin; one review has commented that "''Avatar'' blurs the line between anime and (US) domestic cartoons until it becomes irrelevant."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/anime/sfw12366.html|title=SciFi Channel Anime Review|accessdate=2006-10-16|work=SciFi}}</ref> In addition, Avatar has many features of anime such as having a different color palette from other animated shows.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.awn.com/index.php?ltype=top&newsitem_no=13156 | title = Avatar: The Last Airbender Article | accessdate = 2006-12-16 |date=2005-02-18 | publisher = Animation World Magazine}}</ref>

''Avatar'' creators Bryan Konietzko and Michael Dante DiMartino confirmed a particular anime influence in a magazine interview:
{{quote|The best anime balances great action sequences with humor and emotion, something we try to do on ''Avatar''. We love all the films of Hayao Miyazaki, especially [[Spirited Away]] and [[Princess Mononoke]]. Both movies deal with spirituality and the environment in an entertaining way. Also, there's a lot of great animation."<ref name = "musogato_elements"/>}}

According to an interview with the artists involved in creating ''Avatar'', Appa's design was based on the [[Catbus]] in ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]'', due to the peculiar task of creating a mammal with six legs.<ref>{{Cite video | people = Bryan Konietzko and Michael Dante DiMartino | year = 2006 | title = Book 1: Water, Box Set | medium = DVD |date=2006-09-19}}</ref>

''Avatar'' also draws inspiration from the anime works of [[Shinichiro Watanabe]]'s ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'' and ''[[Samurai Champloo]]'', as well as ''[[FLCL]]'' (''Fooly Cooly'') of [[Gainax]]. Other various studios from which inspiration was drawn include Studio 4&nbsp;°C, [[Production I.G]], and [[Studio Ghibli]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musogato.com/avatar/magazine/anime_insider-dec06.jpg|title=Anime Insider: December 2006|accessdate=2007-03-20}}</ref> Bryan has commented that some of his most cherished Watanabe fight scenes were the fight between ''Bebop's'' [[Spike Spiegel]] and a drug smuggler in "[[List of Cowboy Bebop episodes|Asteroid Blues]]," as well as the duel between [[List of Samurai Champloo characters#Mugen|Mugen]] and a [[List of Samurai Champloo characters#Sara|blind female Jojutsu-user]] in the ''Champloo'' episode "[[List of Samurai Champloo episodes 13-26|Elegy of Entrapment (Verse 2)]]." ''Avatar'' director Giancarlo Volpe also claims the staff "were all ordered to buy ''FLCL'' and watch every single episode of it."<ref>{{Cite video | url = http://flaming-june.org/videos/Audience%20Question%20&%20Answer%20Pt.%202.wmv | title = Audience Q&A Part 2 | publisher = Flaming June | format = WMV File | medium = Online Video | people = Volpe, Giancarlo (Director); Ehasz, Aaron (Head Writer); Desena, Jack (Voice of Sokka); Basco, Dante (Voice of Zuko) | accessdate = 2006-12-31}}</ref>

==Response==
===Ratings===
When the show debuted, it was rated the best animated television series in its [[demographic]].<ref name="animation">{{cite web | url = http://www.animationinsider.net/article.php?articleID=1066 | title = Avatar: Season 3 | accessdate = 2006-12-16 |date=2006-06-30 | author = Aaron H.

==Media information==
===Broadcast history===
The show was first revealed to the public in a teaser reel at [[Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]] 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.nick.com/all_nick/tv_supersites/video.jhtml?show_id=ava&clip=16 | title = Avatar: The Last Airbender Sneak Peak|accessdate = 2006-12-10|puisher = Nickelodeon}}</ref> It was scheduled to air on Nickelodeon on [[November 29]] of that year, but was delayed until [[February 21]] of 2005. The first two episodes of the series were shown together in a one-hour premiere event in the United States.

===Promotion and merchandising===
''Avatar'''s success has led to promotions with [[Burger King]] and [[Upper Deck Company|Upper Deck Entertainment]], an Avatar-themed [[roller coaster]] that debuted at [[Kings Island]] amusement park on April 14, 2006 and The Avatar Airbender in 2008 at [[Nickelodeon Universe]] in the [[Mall of America]], and two special issues of ''[[Nickelodeon Magazine|Nick Mag Presents]]'' dedicated entirely to the show. Various members of the ''Avatar'' staff and cast appeared at the 2006 San Diego Comic-Con International convention, while co-creators Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko appeared as guests of honor with Martial Arts Consultant Sifu Kisu at the Pacific Media Expo on [[October 28]], [[2006]]. ''Avatar'' also has its own line of t-shirts, [[LEGO]] playsets, toys, a [[Avatar: The Last Airbender Trading Card Game|trading card game]], a [[cine-manga]], and two video games.

The [[Mattel]]-produced action figure toy line generated some controversy with its exclusion of any female characters. While minor male characters (such as [[List of Avatar: The Last Airbender minor recurring characters#King Bumi|King Bumi]]) and forms of the main characters unseen in the program (such as 'Water Nation Aang') were included, significant female characters, most notably Katara, were missing, leading to accusations of [[sexism]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://wheres-katara.blogspot.com | title = Where's Katara? The Avatar, Mattel, and Sexism |accessdate = 2007-08-02}}</ref> Mattel eventually came to release information stating that they have taken account of Katara's increased role within the program and also that she would be included in the figure assortment for mid 2007 release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.livejournal.com/avatar_fans/1658088.html|title=Live Journal}}</ref> Representatives of [[Fisher Price]]/Mattel have released that the ''Avatar'' toyline has been discontinued due to poor sales. No new action figures are to be produced and made available aside from those past released in February 2006 that may already be on the shelves.

Nickelodeon executives have since released highly optimistic plans for upcoming marketing strategies in regards to ''Avatar'', with Nickelodeon President Cyma Zarghami openly stating their belief that if done correctly, the franchise very well "could become their ''[[Harry Potter]]''". Nickelodeon expects consumers to spend about $121 million in 2007 on the emerging franchise, rising to $254 million in 2009 (not including revenue from commercial advertisers). The revenues make ''Avatar'' one of the most profitable animated series in television history. The marketing plans are to be enacted coinciding with the release of the first of a trilogy of live-action films based on the series in 2009.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.usatoday.com/money/media/2007-09-20-avatar_N.htm | title = Nick pins hopes on Avatar | publisher = [[USA Today]] | date = [[2007-09-20]] | accessdate=2008-04-16}}</ref>

===Feature film adaptation===
On [[January 8]], 2007, [[Paramount Pictures]]' [[MTV Films]] and [[Nickelodeon Movies]] announced that they have signed [[M. Night Shyamalan]] to write, direct and produce a trilogy of live-action films based on the series, the first of which will encompass the main characters' adventures of Book One.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://i14.tinypic.com/4qqwrcn.jpg|title=i14.tinypic.com/4qqwrcn.jpg<!--INSERT TITLE-->}}</ref> The film was in a dispute with [[James Cameron]]'s film ''[[Avatar (film)|Avatar]]'' regarding title ownership,<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117956950.html?categoryid=13&cs=1&nid=2564 | title = Shyamalan's 'Avatar' also to bigscreen | accessdate = 2007-01-09 | author = Pamela McClintock | date= [[2007-01-08]] | publisher = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}</ref> which resulted in the film being merely titled ''The Last Airbender''.

Avatar co-creators [[Michael Dante DiMartino|Mike DiMartino]] and [[Bryan Konietzko]] have come forward to voice their opinion within an interview regarding M. Night Shyamalan writing, directing and producing the film. The two displayed much enthusiasm over Shyamalan's decision for the adaptation, stating that they admire his work and he in turn respects their material. This newfound information dispels fears that the co-creators were going to be left completely out of the creative process as Paramount did not specify their level of contribution when initial announcements of the deal with Shyamalan came forward.<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=3&id=40610 | title = Avatar Creators Praise Night | accessdate = 2007-03-17 | author = Mike Szymanski| date = [[2007-03-17]] | publisher = [[Sci Fi Wire]]}}</ref>

===Musical score===
Avatar features an extensive original musical score, written by composers Benjamin Wynn and [[Jeremy Zuckerman]], founders of the Track Team.<ref name="ASNtrack" /> According to an interview with Jeremy Zuckerman, the team had been hired by the creators due to a roommate story.<ref name="ASNtrack">{{cite web |url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/interviews.php?id=2 |title=Music Interview with the Track Team 1 of 3 |accessdate=2008-04-08 |author=Acastus |date=2006-07-23 |work=Interview |publisher=Avatar Spirit.Net}} </ref> Benjamin Wynn had been roommates with Bryan Konietzko while he and DiMartino were creating Avatar. The creators decided to hire Wynn and Zuckerman to do the score, having complete faith in their ability.<ref name="ASNtrack" /> Because the instruments are chosen based on [[timbre]], and not culture, the music in the show is composed of both Western and Eastern instruments.<ref name="ASNtrack2">{{cite web |url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/interviews.php?id=3 |title=Music Interview with the Track Team 2 of 3 |accessdate=2008-04-08 |author=Acastus |date=2006-08-05 |work=Interview |publisher=Avatar Spirit.Net}}</ref> Chosen for its intimacy and gentle sounds, the [[Kalimba]] is used in the more serene moments.<ref name="ASNtrack2" /> The sound of the sunghi horn, a [[fiction]]al instrument that first appeared on the show in the episode "The Waterbending Scroll", is also used in the musical score of the show. It is described as having a sound like an instrument that is part [[Reed (instrument)|reed]] and part [[Brass instrument|brass]].<ref name="ASNtrack3">{{cite web |url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/interviews.php?id=4 |title=Music Interview with the Track Team 3 of 3 |accessdate=2008-04-08 |author=Acastus |date=2006-08-12 |work=Interview |publisher=Avatar Spirit.Net}}</ref> 

In the show, several of the themes are based on, or inspired by others.<ref name="SoundTRACK">{{cite web |url=http://soundtrack.net/features/article/?id=252 |title=SoundtrackNet : Interview - The Music of Avatar: The Last Airbender |accessdate=2008-04-08 |author=Mike Brennan |date=2008-04-07 |work=Interview |publisher=SoundtrackNet}}</ref> The Fire Nation theme has been the basis and inspiration for several themes. Unlike most of the series, which uses a sample library, the final four episodes will feature a live string ensemble, which will give possibilities that can't be done with a sample library.<ref name="SoundTRACK" />
