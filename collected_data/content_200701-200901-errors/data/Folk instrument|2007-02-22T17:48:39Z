A '''folk instrument''' is an instrument that developed among common people and usually doesn't have a known [[inventor]]. It can be made from [[wood]], [[metal]] or other material. It is a part of [[folk music]]. The instruments can be percussion instruments, different types of [[flute]]s, the [[Musical bow|bow]] and different types of [[trumpet]]s.[[Image:Cavaquinho1.jpg|thumb|The [[cavaquinho]] is a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] folk instrument.]]

Some instruments are referred to as folk instruments even if they do not meet the criteria for classifying a folk instrument because they commonly appear in folk music. An example would be [[harmonica]].
