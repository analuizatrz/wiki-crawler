'''Dell Inc.''' ({{nasdaq|DELL}} {{hkex|4331}}), an [[United States|American]] technology company based in [[Round Rock, Texas]], develops, manufactures, sells, and supports [[personal computer]]s, [[Server (computing)|servers]], [[data storage device]]s, [[network switch]]es, [[personal digital assistant]]s (PDAs), [[computer software|software]], [[television]]s, computer [[peripheral]]s, and other [[technology]]-related products. As of [[2008]], Dell employed more than 95,000 people worldwide. 

Dell grew through the 1980s and 1990s to become at one stage the largest seller of PCs and servers. It [[as of 2008|currently]] holds the third spot in the [[computer industry]] behind [[Hewlett Packard]] and [[Acer Inc.]] 

In 2006, [[Fortune magazine]] ranked Dell as the 25th-largest company in the [[Fortune 500]] list, 8th on its annual [http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/mostadmired/top20/ Top 20 list] of the most-admired companies in the United States. In 2007 Dell ranked 34th and 8th respectively on the equivalent lists for the year. A 2006 publication identified Dell as one of 38 high-performance companies in the [[S&P 500]] which had consistently out-performed the market over the previous 15 years.<ref>Mark L. Frigo, Belvard E. Needles and Marian Powers: "Strategy and Integrated Financial Ratio Performance Measures: Further Evidence of the Financial Performance Scorecard and High Performance Companies".

==== Manufacturing ====

Dell has a general policy of manufacturing its products close to its customers, implementing [[Just In Time (business)|Just-in-Time]] (JIT) manufacturing. Assembly of desktop computers for the North American market takes place at Dell plants in [[Lebanon, Tennessee]], [[Austin, Texas]], and [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]]{{Fact|date=June 2007}}; with servers built in Austin, Texas. 

Dell assembles computers for the [[Europe, the Middle East and Africa|EMEA]] market at [[Limerick]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]], and employs about 4,500 people in that country. European Manufacturing Facility 1 (EMF1, opened in 1990) and EMF3 form part of the [[Raheen Industrial Estate]] near Limerick. EMF2 (previously a [[Wang Laboratories|Wang]] facility, later occupied by [[Flextronics]], situated in Castletroy) closed in [[2002]],{{Fact|date=September 2007}} and Dell Inc has consolidated production into EMF3 (EMF1 now <!-- as of when? --> contains only offices<ref>http://www.blythe.org/nytransfer-subs/2000ire/IEP:_The_IE_Professional_No.250_5-17</ref>). Construction of EMF4 in [[Łódź]], [[Poland]] has [[as of 2007|started]], with production planned to start there in autumn 2007.<ref>[http://www1.euro.dell.com/content/topics/topic.aspx/emea/corporate/pressoffice/2006/uk/en/2006_09_18_brk_000?c=uk&l=en&s=corp Dell Announces Manufacturing Facility In Poland To Serve Growing Central And Eastern European Markets<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Dell's assembly-plants in [[China]] and [[Malaysia]] assemble 95% of Dell notebooks. Dell Inc has invested <!-- when ? --> an estimated 60 million US Dollars in a new manufacturing unit in [[Chennai]], India, to support the sales of its products in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Indian-made products will bear the "Made in India" mark on them. In 2007 the Chennai facility has the target of producing 400,000 desktop PCs, and in the later half of 2007 it will start producing notebook PCs and other products.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

Dell has a [[Brazil]]ian plant in the city of [[Eldorado do Sul, Brazil|Eldorado do Sul]], close to the state capital [[Porto Alegre]], in the state of [[Rio Grande do Sul]] — that assembles the PowerEdge server  line.<ref>[http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/corp/pressoffice/en/2001/2001_02_19_pa_000?c=us&l=en&s=corp Dell Starts Manufacturing Servers in Brazil<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Technical support ==

<!--specific criticism removed, and some content moved to the criticism section below, where appropriate - do not re-add here. -->

=== Levels ===

Dell routes technical support queries according to component-type and to the level of support purchased. Dell Inc brands its [[service agreement]]s at four levels:<ref>
[http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/services/en/ess_comparisonchart?c=us&cs=555&l=en&s=biz Dell support levels]
</ref>

* Basic support provides business-hours telephone support and next business-day on-site support. 

* Silver support provides 24&times;7 telephone support and 4-hour on-site support after telephone-based troubleshooting. 

* Gold support provides additional benefits over and above Silver support, including: customer-declared severity; priority access to support; expedited escalation of support; 4-hour on-site support in parallel with telephone-support.

* Platinum Plus support provides additional benefits to Gold Support, including: performance benchmarking; real-time tracking; custom planning and reporting; a dedicated technical account-manager.

On [[4 February]] 2008 Dell launched a revamped services-and-support scheme for [[business]]es named "ProSupport", offering customers more options to tailor services to fit their needs. Rather than take a one-size-fits-all approach, Dell has put together packages of options for each category of its customers: [[Small and medium enterprise|small and medium-sized businesse]]s, large businesses, government, education, and health-care- and life-sciences. 

Dell now offers separate support options for IT staff and for non-IT professionals. For the latter, the company offers "how-to" support for software applications, such as [[Microsoft Office]]. Dell also offers collaborative support with many third-party software vendors.  For IT departments, Dell offers "fast-track dispatch" of parts and labor and access to a crisis-center to handle major outages, virus-attacks, or problems caused by natural disasters. 

Besides offering response-options for handling problems, Dell has launched "Proactive Maintenance", which offers assessment and recommendations for updating drivers and firmware and for the application of customer-approved patches and system-updates. Dell also offers assessment-services for [[storage area network]]s, as well as for Dell's computing hardware. 

The new offerings replace Dell's tiered services-structure in which customers could choose from a variety of service levels, such as platinum, gold, or silver. The latest system takes a more customizable approach to support.

=== Service Tags ===

Dell associates a ''Service Tag'', a unique alpha-numeric identifier, with most of its products, which resembles a [[serial number]]. The Service Tag number, represented in [[base 36]], has a length of five or seven characters. Software can read the Service Tag in a computer's [[Desktop Management Interface|DMI]] table. Monitors bought as part of a computer system get support via the Service Tag of the computer. Monitors bought separately get support via the Dell Order Number or via the monitor's serial number.

Dell links its Service Tags to ''Express Service Codes'', usually found together with the service tag on a sticker physically attached to a system.  The Express Service Code, a purely numerical conversion of the service tag, serves for use in Dell's [[trunkline]] for routing a customer to the appropriate phone-technician.

=== DellConnect ===

The DellConnect program, a remote-access tool, gives technicians within Dell Support the ability to access customer computers from a remote location for troubleshooting purposes. By using this tool, support technicians can analyze the configuration of a computer system, view and edit its files and software environment, view and comment on the screen, or take control of the computer system (with the customer's approval) to carry out troubleshooting.

As of 2007 Dell Inc replaced its proprietary remote-access tool with the newer [http://www.dellconnect.com DellConnect 2.0] manufactured by [[Citrix Systems|Citrix]]. After going to the website, the customer simply runs this software, which can permit a support technician to view and work on their computer from a remote location; including the ability to reboot the computer remotely and continuing the same session, to share clipboards, and to redirect the customer to a specific website.

=== World-wide technical support ===

In the Americas, Dell has [http://www1.ca.dell.com/content/topics/topic.aspx/ca/corporate/pressoffice/en/2005/2005_12_09_ott_000?c=ca&l=en&s=corp Customer Contact Centers] in Edmonton, Alberta; Ottawa, Ontario; Central Texas; Salt Lake City, Utah; Nashville, Tennessee; Chesapeake; Twin Falls, Idaho; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; San Salvador, El Salvador; as well as in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia; Panama City, Panama and Tampa, Florida.

In the Asia-Pacific region Dell provides customer support from Pasay City and Quezon City, Philippines; Penang, Malaysia; and Xiamen and Dalian, China. 

In India, Dell has customer support centers in the northern cities of Gurgaon and Mohali; and in the southern cities of Hyderabad and Bangalore.<ref>
http://ipcommunications.tmcnet.com/news/2006/10/06/212847.htm
</ref>

On January 31, 2008 Dell announced that it will be closing its call centre in [[Edmonton]], Alberta effective May 02, 2008 laying off over 900 workers and abandoning the sweetheart deal it had agreed to with the city of Edmonton.

=== Criticism ===

Dell technical support often finds itself under criticism. In 2006 ''The New York Times'' published a humorous review of the company's situation in an article by David Pogue. Pogue lamented the difficulties customers face when attempting to reach tech-support by phone. "When you are ready to MAKE THE CALL", he wrote, "go to the bathroom, take an aspirin, get a book or crossword, stock up on water and nibbles (preferably ones with high sugar content and no nutritional value; Twinkies are good)".<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/22/technology/circuits/23POGUE-EMAIL.html How to Survive a Tech Support Call - New York Times<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

See also the general [[Dell#Criticism]] section.

== Commercial aspects ==
=== Traditional business model ===

Traditionally, Dell has sold all its products — whether to [[end user|end-use]] consumers or to corporate customers — using a direct-sales model via the [[Internet]] and the [[telephone]]-network. Dell maintains a negative [[cash conversion cycle]] through use of this model: in other words, Dell Inc. receives payment for the products before it has to pay for the materials. Dell also practises [[Just In Time (business)|just-in-time]] (JIT) inventory-management, profiting from its attendant benefits. Dell's JIT approach utilizes the "pull" system by building computers only after customers place orders and by requesting materials from suppliers as needed. In this way Dell mirrors [[Toyota]] by following [[The Toyota Way|Toyota Way]] Principle #3 ("Use 'pull' systems to avoid overproduction"). Since the days of the original dominance of telephone-ordering, the Internet has significantly enhanced Dell’s business-model, making it easier for customers and potential customers to contact Dell directly. This model also has enabled Dell to provide very customizable systems at an affordable rate, since Dell's manufacturing arm builds specifically for each customer. Other computer-manufacturers, including [[Gateway, Inc.|Gateway]] and [[Hewlett-Packard]], have attempted to adapt{{Fact|date=July 2007}} similar business-models, but due to timing and/or retail-channel pressures{{Fact|date=July 2007}} they have not achieved the same results as Dell.

Dell has also sold at retail, as explained in the [[Dell#Marketing |"Marketing" section of this article]].

=== Organization ===

A [[Board of Directors]] of nine people runs the company. [[Michael Dell]], the founder of the company, serves on the board. Other board members include [[Donald J. Carty|Don Carty]], [[William H. Gray (congressman)|William Gray]], [[Judy Lewent]], [[Klaus Luft]], [[Alex Mandl]], [[Michael A. Miles]], and [[Sam Nunn]]. [[Shareholder]]s elect the nine board members at [[meeting]]s, and those board members who do not get a majority of votes must submit a [[resignation]] to the board, which will subsequently choose whether or not to accept the resignation. The board of directors usually sets up five committees which have oversight over specific matters. These committees include the Audit Committee, which handles accounting issues, including auditing and reporting; the Compensation Committee, which approves compensation for the CEO and other employees of the company; the Finance Committee, which handles [[financial]] matters such as proposed mergers and acquisitions; the Governance and Nominating Committee, which handles various corporate matters (including nomination of the board); and the Antitrust Compliance Committee, which attempts to prevent company practices from violating [[antitrust]] laws.

The corporate structure and management of Dell extends beyond the board of directors. The Dell Global Executive Management Committee sets the strategic direction for how the corporation keeps customers at the forefront, from designing and manufacturing computer systems to offering products that meet customers' requirements to providing sufficient service and support. Dell has regional senior vice presidents for countries other than the United States, including David Marmonti for [[Europe, the Middle East and Africa|EMEA]] and Stephen J. Felice for [[Asia]]/[[Japan]]. [[As of 2007]], other officers include Martin Garvin (senior vice president for worldwide procurement) and [[Susan Sheskey|Susan E. Sheskey]] (vice president and [[chief information officer]]).

=== Marketing ===

Dell [[advertisement]]s have appeared in several types of [[Mass media|media]] including [[television]], the [[Internet]], [[magazines]], [[Mail-order catalog|catalogs]] and [[newspapers]]. Some of Dell Inc's marketing strategies include lowering prices at all times of the year, offering free bonus products (such as Dell printers), and offering free shipping in order to encourage more sales and to stave off competitors. In 2006, Dell [http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/feb2006/tc20060223_710372.htm?chan=search cut its prices] in an effort to maintain its 19.2% market share. However, this also cut profit-margins by more than half, from 8.7 to 4.3 percent. To maintain its low prices, Dell continues to accept most purchases of its products via the [[Internet]] and through the telephone network, and to move its customer-care division to [[India]] and [[El Salvador]].<ref>[http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/corp/pressoffice/en/2007/2007_03_20_ndi_000?c=us&l=en&s=corp Michael Dell Sees India Playing a Key Role in the Online World<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

A popular United States television and print ad campaign in the early 2000s featured the actor [[Ben Curtis (actor)|Ben Curtis]] playing the part of "Steven", a lightly mischievous blond-haired kid who came to the assistance of bereft computer purchasers. Each television advertisement usually ended with Steven's catch-phrase: "Dude, you're gettin' a Dell!" 

A subsequent advertising campaign featured [[intern]]s at Dell headquarters (with Curtis' character appearing in a small cameo at the end of one of the first commercials in this particular campaign).

A Dell advertising campaign for the XPS line of gaming computers featured in print in the September 2006 issue of [[Wired Magazine]]. It used as a [[tagline]] the common term in [[Internet]] and [[gamer]] slang: "FTW", meaning "For The Win". However, Dell Inc. soon dropped the campaign.

In the [[first-person shooter]] game [[F.E.A.R. Extraction Point]], several computers visible on desks within the game have recognizable Dell XPS model characteristics, sometimes even including the Dell logo on the monitors.

In 2007 Dell switched advertising agencies in the US from [[BBDO]] to [[Mother (disambiguation)|Mother]].{{Fact|date=August 2007}} In July 2007, Dell released new advertising created by Mother to support the Inspiron and XPS lines. The ads featured music from the [[The Flaming Lips|Flaming Lips]] and [[Devo]] who re-formed especially to record the song in the ad "Work it Out".

==== Dell kiosks ====

[[Image:Chermside dell kiosk.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Dell Direct Store, Brisbane, Queensland]]

Starting in 2002, Dell opened [[kiosk]] locations in [[shopping mall]]s across the United States in order to give personal service to customers who preferred this method of shopping to using the Internet or the telephone-system. Despite the added expense, prices at the kiosks match or beat prices available through other retail channels. Starting in 2005, Dell expanded [[kiosk]] locations to include [[shopping malls]] across [http://www.dell.com.au/delldirectstore Australia], [http://www.dell.ca/delldirectstore Canada], [http://www1.ap.dell.com/content/topics/topic.aspx/ap/topics/main/en/direct_kiosk?c=sg&l=en&s=dhs Singapore] and [[Hong Kong]].  

On [[January 30]] 2008 Dell shut down all 140 kiosks in the US due to expansion into retail stores such as [[Wal-Mart]], [[Best Buy]], and [[Staples Inc.|Staples]].

==== Dell stores in the U.S. ====

In [[2006]] Dell Inc. opened one full store, 3,000-square-foot in area, at [[NorthPark Center]] in [[Dallas, Texas]]. It operates the 3,000-square-foot retail outlet seven days a week to display about 36 models, including PCs and televisions. As at the kiosks, customers can only see demonstration-computers and place orders through agents. Dell then delivers purchased items just as if the customer had placed the order by phone or over the Internet. 

Dell Inc planned to use the Dallas store to house about three times as many products as it displayed in more than 160 kiosks in malls and airports.{{Fact|date=August 2007}} In addition to showcasing products, the stores also support on-site warranties and non-warranty service ("Dell on Call"). Services offered include repairing computer video-cards and removing spyware from hard drives.

==== Retail in the U.S. ====

In the early 1990s, Dell also sold its products through [[Best Buy]], [[Costco]] and [[Sam's Club]] stores in the United States. Dell stopped this practice in 1994, citing low profit-margins on the business. In 2003, Dell briefly sold products in [[Sears]] stores in the U.S. In 2007, Dell started shipping its products to major retailers in the U.S. once again, starting with [[Sam's Club]] and [[Wal-Mart]]. [[Staples Inc.|Staples]], the largest office-supply retailer in the U.S., and [[Best Buy]], the largest electronics retailer in the U.S., became Dell retail partners later that same year.

==== Retail in Canada ====

[[As of 2008|As of the end of February 2008]], Dell products shipped to one of the largest office-supply retailers in Canada, [[Staples Business Depot]].

==== Direct retail in Eastern Europe ====

Since some shoppers in certain markets show reluctance to purchase technological products through the phone or the Internet, Dell has looked into opening retail operations in some countries.  In April 2007, Dell opened a retail store in [[Budapest]]. In October of the same year, Dell opened a retail store in [[Moscow]]. 

==== Retail in the UK ====

Since December 2007 [[HMV Group plc|HMV]]'s flagship [[Trocadero (London)|Trocadero]] store has sold Dell XPS PCs. From January 2008 the UK stores of [[DSG International (retailer)|DSGi]] have sold Dell products   (in particular, through [[Currys]] and [[PC World (retailer)|PC World]] stores). {As of 2008]] the large supermarket-chain [[Tesco]] sold Dell laptops and desktops in stores throughout the UK.

=== Environmental sensitivity ===

Dell became the first company in the [[information technology industry]] to establish a product-[[recycling]] goal (in 2004) and completed the implementation of its global consumer recycling-program in 2006.<ref>[http://www.socialfunds.com/news/article.cgi/1421.html Dell First US Computer Company to Commit to a Global Recycling Goal<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
On [[February 6]], 2007, the National Recycling Coalition awarded Dell its "Recycling Works" award for efforts to promote producer responsibility.<ref name="National Recycling Coalition">
http://www.nrc-recycle.org/recyclingworkswinners.aspx - National Recycling Coalition
</ref>
On [[July 19]], 2007, Dell announced that it had exceeded targets in working to achieve a multi-year goal of recovering 275 million pounds of computer equipment by 2009.<ref>
http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/070719/tx_dell_recycling.html?.v=1
</ref>
The company reported the recovery of 78 million pounds (nearly 40,000 tons) of IT equipment from customers in 2006, a 93-percent increase over 2005; and 12.4% of the equipment Dell sold seven years earlier.<ref name="Dell Inc."> http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/corp/pressoffice/en/2007/2007_07_19_rr_001?c=us&l=en&s=corp Dell Inc.
</ref>

On [[June 5]], 2007, Dell set a goal of becoming the greenest technology company on Earth for the long term. The company launched a [[zero-carbon]] initiative that includes:

# reducing Dell's [[carbon intensity]] by 15 percent by 2012
# requiring primary suppliers to report carbon emissions data during quarterly business reviews
# partnering with customers to build the "greenest PC on the planet"
# expanding the company's carbon-offsetting program, "Plant a Tree for Me".

The company introduced the term "[[The Re-Generation]]" during a [[round table]] in London commemorating 2007 [[World Environment Day]]. "The Re-Generation" refers to people of all ages throughout the world who want to make a [[difference]] in improving the world's environment. Dell also talked about plans to take the lead in setting an environmental standard for the "[[technology industry]]" and maintaining that [[leadership]] in the future.

=== Competition ===

Dell's major competitors include [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Hewlett-Packard]] (HP), [[Sun Microsystems]], [[Gateway, Inc.|Gateway]], [[Lenovo]], [[Sony]], [[Acer (company)|Acer]], [[Toshiba]] and [[Asus]]. Dell and its subsidiary, [[Alienware]], compete in the enthusiast market against [[Falcon Northwest]], [[Voodoo PC]] (a subsidiary of HP), and other manufacturers. In the second quarter of 2006 Dell had between 18% and 19% share of the worldwide personal computer [http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2006/07/19/pc_market_called_healthy_despite_weak_demand_in_europe market], compared to HP with roughly 15%. By leveraging its business-model, Dell attempts to undercut competitors and offer customers a more attractive choice of personal computers and other equipment. 

Dell [[as of 2006|in late 2006]] lost its lead in the PC-business to Hewlett-Packard. Both [[Gartner]] and [[International Data Corporation|IDC]] estimated that in the third quarter of 2006, HP shipped [http://www.forbes.com/2006/10/19/dell-computer-earnings-markets-equity-cx_mk_1019markets07.html?partner=yahootix more units] worldwide than did Dell. Dell's 3.6% growth paled in comparison to HP's 15% growth during the same period. The problem got worse in the fourth quarter, when Gartner [http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20070117006106&newsLang=en estimated] that Dell PC shipments declined 8.9% (versus HP's 23.9% growth). As a result, at the end of 2006 Dell's overall PC market-share stood at 13.9% (versus HP's 17.4%).

IDC has also reported that Dell lost more server market share than any of the top four competitors in that arena. IDC's Q4 2006 estimates show Dell's share of the server market at 8.1%, down from 9.5% in the previous year. This represents a 8.8% loss year-over-year, primarily to competitors [[EMC Corporation|EMC]] and [[IBM]].<ref>[http://yahoo.reuters.com/news/articlehybrid.aspx?storyID=urn:newsml:reuters.com:20070312:MTFH05034_2007-03-12_21-17-33_N12385967&type=comktNews&rpc=44 World News, Business News, Breaking US & International News | Reuters.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

* On [[January 31]], [[2007]], some shareholders filed a [http://www.betanews.com/article/Inside_the_Dell_Shareholder_Lawsuit_Did_Dell_and_Intel_Conspire/1170465943 lawsuit] accusing Dell and Intel of conspiring, and accusing Dell executives (including Michael Dell) of options-[[backdating]] and of propped [[financial report]]s. Specific allegations claimed that:
** Dell had received kickbacks from Intel to maintain Intel exclusivity
** Dell had used the funds to prop up its sales-figures
** Dell reduced the period and scope of its warranties and cut corners on manufacturing and testing in order to funnel additional funds to sales; causing the stock-price to inflate to around $40 per share
** once stock-prices had peaked, several Dell executives, including Michael Dell, sold massive amounts of their personal stock-holdings to benefit from the artificially inflated stock-price

* On [[February 8]], [[2007]], seven current and former workers at a call-center in [[Roseburg, OR|Roseburg]], [[Oregon]] sued the computer-maker, saying the company worked its [[sales representative|sales rep]]s "off the clock", failed to provide proper rest-breaks and improperly recorded their lunch-periods.<ref>[http://atwork.blogs.oregonlive.com/uploads/487501-dellsuit.pdf OregonLive.com: At Work<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Moves have begun to turn the case into a [[class action]]. Dell closed down the facility at Roseburg, Oregon on [[August 2]], 2007 without any warning to employees.<ref>[http://www.oregonnews.com/article/20070803/NEWS/70803011 newsreview.info - Serving Roseburg & Douglas County, Oregon - News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The facility had consisted of computer and electronics sales-agents (other call-centers absorbed these jobs) and of customer-service representatives (whose jobs Dell outsourced to a facility in El Salvador).

* In March 2007 an article titled "Computer Giant Faces Consumer Lawsuit Consumers Allege They Didn't Get the Tech Support They Paid For" appeared on an ABC News website.<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Technology/story?id=3179394&page=1 ABC News: Dell Sued Over Shoddy Tech Support<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> "Part of the suit claims that though Dell gave the impression of an "award-winning service" available to consumers "24 hours a day, seven days a week", consumers faced "nightmarish obstacles" to get help and technical service for their computers. [[New York]] [[Attorney General]] [[Andrew Cuomo]] said that New York had received 700 complaints about Dell — more than the number of complaints for any other related subject.

* In [[May]] [[2007]], Andrew Cuomo filed a lawsuit against Dell for "false advertising and deceptive business practices, including offering misleading financing, and failing to honor rebates, warranties and service contracts." [http://news.com.com/8301-10784_3-9719804-7.html?part=rss&subj=news&tag=2547-1_3-0-20] Dell spokesman Bob Pearson portrayed the lawsuit as based on only a small portion of Dell's customers and as in no way reflecting the way the company treats its customers. Dell's hardware-warranty contract says that customers must troubleshoot over the phone — including possibly opening the computer — before Dell will send a technical service provider to replace a part.

it would restate and reduce earnings from [[2003]] through to the first quarter of [[2007]] by a total amount of between $50 million and $150 million, or 2 cents to 7 cents per share.

The investigation, begun in [[November]] [[2006]], resulted from concerns raised by the U.S. [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] over some documents and information that Dell Inc. had submitted.<ref>

== Criticism ==

In the 1990s Dell switched from using primarily [[ATX]] [[motherboard]]s and [[Computer power supply|PSU]] to using boards and power-supplies with mechanically-identical but differently-wired connectors. This meant customers wishing to upgrade their hardware could encounter unforeseen problems. However, company practice in this respect changed in 2003.<ref>[http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=339053 InformIT: Dell proprietary (non-standard) ATX design > Dell proprietary (non-standard) ATX design<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>

Consumer complaints about the quality of customer-service mounted<!-- when ? -->, and in 2006, Dell acknowledged that it had problems with customer-service.
