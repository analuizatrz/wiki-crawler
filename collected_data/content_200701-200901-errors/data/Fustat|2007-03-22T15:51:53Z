'''Fustat''' ({{lang-ar|الفسطاط}}), also spelled '''Fostat''', was the first capital city of [[Egypt]] under [[Arab]] rule. It was built by [[Amr ibn al-As]] right after the Arab conquest of Egypt in [[641]] CE. The city was eventually absorbed by [[Cairo]], which was built to the north of Fostat during the [[Fatimid]] era. Fostat is now part of the 'Old Egypt' District in Cairo.

The city was Egypt's first on-Nile capital since the time of the Pharaohs, when Thebes and Memphis had been the capitals. After [[Alexander the Great|Alexander the Great's]] invasion and conquest of Egypt, [[Alexandria]], on the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast, became Egypt's capital for hundreds of years. 

The city's name comes from the Arabic word ''Fustat'' (فسطاط) which means tent. The traditional story of the establishment of the city is that Amr Ibn Al-As decided to build his capital city for Egypt at the spot where his tent was pitched. The name was taken from ''Misr al-Fustat'' ("The tented city"). From this also comes ''Misr'', the Arabic name for Egypt.
