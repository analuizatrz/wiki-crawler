{{lowercase|p14ARF}}
'''p14ARF''' is an alternate reading frame (ARF) product of the [[CDKN2A]] locus. Both [[p16INK4a]] and p14ARF are involved in [[cell cycle]] regulation. p14ARF inhibits [[mdm2]], thus promoting [[p53]], which promotes [[p21]] activation, which then binds and inactivates certain [[cyclin]]-[[CDK]] complexes, which would otherwise promote [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of [[gene]]s that would carry the [[cell (biology)|cell]] through the [[G<sub>1</sub>/S checkpoint]] of the cell cycle.  Loss of p14ARF by a [[Mutation#By_inheritance|homozygous mutation]] in the CDKN2A (INK4A) gene will lead to elevated levels in [[MDM2]] and therefore loss of [[p53]] function and cell cycle control.
