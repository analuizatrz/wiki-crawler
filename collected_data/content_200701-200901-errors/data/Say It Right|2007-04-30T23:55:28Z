"'''Say It Right'''" is a [[pop music|pop]]-[[contemporary R&B|R&B]] song written by [[Canada|Canadian]] singer [[Nelly Furtado]], [[Timbaland|Timothy "Timbaland" Mosley]] and [[Nate Hills|Nate "Danja" Hills]] for Furtado's third album ''[[Loose (album)|Loose]]'' (2006). It was co-produced by Timbaland and Danja and released as the album's third [[single (music)|single]] in [[North America]] and [[Australia]], with its U.S. radio release on [[October 31]] [[2006]] (see [[2006 in music]]).<ref>AllAccess.com</ref> In February 2007 it became Furtado's second number-one single in the United States. The song served as the album's fourth single in [[Europe]] and [[Asia]]; it was released in the [[United Kingdom]] in March 2007 as a download-only single, helping the album reach a new peak position. The song will serve as the album's fifth single in [[Latin America]]; in Mexico it is the fourth radio single and, according to MTV, the third single accompanied by a video.

It is featured on the compilation album [[Now That's What I Call Music! 24 (U.S. series)| Now 24]].

==Background==
The process of creating the song began in the recording studio one morning at around 4:00am, when Timbaland recommended that Furtado go home because she was tired. Furtado, who had heard that the band [[U2]], one of her favorite artists,{{Fact|date=February 2007}} wrote many of their songs in the studio control room, said "Really? I'll show you", put on her [[hoodie]] and began to "[[jam session|jam]]".<ref name="RS">Scaggs, Austin. [http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10603268/why_is_nelly_furtados_new_album_so_loud "Why Is Nelly Furtado's New Album So Loud?"]. ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. [[June 19]] [[2006]]. Retrieved [[December 30]] [[2006]].</ref> Nate Hills and Timbaland soon joined her, writing and producing as they went, and according to Furtado this process intensified as she sang. The team used four microphones in the live room and moved them around during recording, about which Furtado said "...when you listen to it &mdash; there's a lot of dimension. It kind of sounds like [Timbaland]'s in another country".<ref name="RS"/> Afterwards they picked the best vocals and "perfected" them, before inserting "reverbs and weird alien sounds" onto them. "[W]e experimented a lot with depth and different sounds", Furtado said of the making of the song. "[It] affected my vocals a whole lot."<ref name="RS"/> 

Furtado has cited the "spooky, [[electronic keyboard|keyboard]]-driven pop sound" of the band [[Eurythmics]], particularly their song "[[Here Comes the Rain Again]]" (1983), as an influence on "Say It Right" and other tracks on ''Loose''. "I'm not 100 percent sure what ["Here Comes the Rain Again" is] about, but it always takes me away to another place, and I love it", she said.<ref name="umusic">[http://umusic.ca/nellyfurtado/ "Nelly Furtado"]. [[Universal Music]] Canada. Retrieved [[December 30]] [[2006]].</ref> She said that she does not really know what "Say It Right" is about, "but it captures the feeling I had when I wrote it, and it taps into this other sphere."<ref name="umusic"/> The song is written in [[F minor]], and its structure resembles a typical Eurythmics song.

''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' called the song "a [[Pussycat Dolls]]-inspired contempo jam, high on hooks and of-the-moment production. Well done, if in the most generic sense."<ref>[http://music.monstersandcritics.com/reviews/article_1226822.php/Single_Reviews_Chris_Daughtry_Avril_Lavigne_Brooks_&_Dunn_Nelly_Furtado_Hinder "Single Reviews: Chris Daughtry, Avril Lavigne, Brooks & Dunn, Nelly Furtado, Hinder"]. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''. [[November 27]] [[2006]]. Retrieved [[December 30]] [[2006]].</ref>

The video debuted on MTV NORTH on [[April 2]] [[2007]].{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

The clip starts with a helicopter landing on top of a black helipad with Furtado's name on it in [[Downtown Los Angeles]], and Furtado getting out. The short black dress she is wearing was designed specifically for her by Australian designer [[Alex Perry]].<ref>Moran, Jonathan.

Retrieved [[March 20]] [[2007]].</ref> She is shown on the roof of the building throughout the video, with the [[Los Angeles]] skyline in the background. The video features mostly face shots of her and Timbaland intercut with shots of dancers. Furtado described the clip as "a throwback to the '80s" because the shots of her and Timbaland reminded her much of those of [[Annie Lennox]] and [[David A. Stewart|Dave Stewart]] in videos for Eurythmics' singles, and "the strange relationship [they] had, where ... you get this intense vibe from it. And Tim and me, we're partners, we vibe on a serious creative level, so the video captures that energy."<ref name="MTV-Nov2006"/> The video ends with Furtado climbing back into the helicopter, which flies off.
