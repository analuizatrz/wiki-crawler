'''Todd Rokita''' currently serves as Indiana's [[Secretary of State]]. When Rokita was elected to office in [[2002]], he became the youngest Secretary of State in the United States at the time. This was his first elected office.

Rokita was elected by his peers nationally to serve on the nine-member federal Executive Board of the Election Assistance Commission. The Commission is charged by law to address election reform issues on a nation-wide basis. Rokita has testified about Indiana's voting reform efforts before the United States Congress.

Rokita also serves as Indiana's chief securities fraud investigator. Rokita's office has closed hundreds of enforcement actions against violators of securities law, uncovered investor fraud scams, and helped secure numerous felony convictions and millions of dollars in restitution and fines. 

As Secretary of State, Rokita visits each of Indiana's 92 counties at least once each year. Rokita was recently named as one of the "40 under 40" by the Indianapolis Business Journal.

A native of [[Munster, Indiana]], he has a law degree from Indiana University School of Law-Indianapolis and a Bachelor of Arts degree from [[Wabash College]]. At Wabash, Rokita earned distinction as an Eli Lilly Fellow. After law school, Rokita worked as a practicing attorney for several years. Rokita then began serving in the Secretary of State's office in [[1997]], first as its general counsel and then as deputy secretary of state.

Rokita is active in the National Association of Secretaries of State (NASS), and was recently elected treasurer of the organization which, following NASS history, may mean he will serve as president in [[2007]]-[[2008]].

Rokita is a member of the Director's Circle of the Indiana Council for Economic Education, the state bar association, the Knights of Columbus, and the National Rifle Association. A commercial-rated pilot, Rokita volunteers his time by flying people in need of non-emergency medical care to hospitals and clinics throughout the Midwest for treatment and is a member of the Indiana chapter of the International Flying Farmers. Rokita has also served as Chair of NASS' New Millennium Young Voters Summit of 2004, chair of the standing Voter Participation Committee and vice chair of the Securities Regulation Committee.

==Controversy==
In [[April]] [[2007]], Rokita was discussing how 90 percent of blacks vote for Democrats, after which he said, "How can that be? Ninety to 10. Who's the master and who's the slave in that relationship? How can that be healthy?"  Four days after making those remarks, he apologized.
