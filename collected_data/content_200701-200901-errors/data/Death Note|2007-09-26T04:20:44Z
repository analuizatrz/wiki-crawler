{{Nihongo|'''''Death Note'''''|デスノート|Desu Nōto}} is a [[manga]] series created in [[Japan]] by two [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[Mangaka|manga artists]], the writer [[Tsugumi Ohba]] and illustrator [[Takeshi Obata]]. The series primarily centers around a high school student who decides to rid the world of evil with the help of a [[supernatural]] [[notebook]] that kills anyone whose name is written in it.

''Death Note'' was first serialized by [[Shueisha]] in the Japanese manga magazine ''[[Weekly Shonen Jump]]'' from the first issue in December 2003 to May 2006, with 108 chapters in total. The series has been published in its entirety in 12 [[tankōbon]] volumes in Japan and in [[North America]]. The series has been adapted into a pair of [[live-action]] [[film]]s released in Japan on [[June 17]] [[2006]] and [[November 3]] [[2006]] respectively, and an anime series which aired in Japan from [[October 3]] [[2006]] to [[June 26]], [[2007]]. Also, a [[novelization]] of the series, written by [[light novel]]ist [[Ishin Nishio]], was released in Japan on [[August 1]] [[2006]].

==Plot==
[[List of Death Note characters|Light Yagami]] is an extremely intelligent young man who resents the crime and corruption in the world. His life undergoes a drastic change when he discovers a mysterious notebook, known as the "Death Note", lying on the ground in the year 2003. The Death Note's instructions claim that if a human's name is written within it that person shall die. Light is initially skeptical of the Death Note's authenticity, believing it is just a prank. However, after experimenting with it and killing two criminals, Light is forced to admit that the Death Note is real. After meeting with the previous owner of the Death Note, a ''[[shinigami]]'' named Ryuk, Light seeks to become "the God of the new world" by passing his judgment on criminals.

Soon, the number of inexplicable deaths of reported criminals catches the attention of the [[Interpol|International Police Organization]] and a mysterious detective known only as "''L''". L quickly learns that the serial killer, dubbed by the public as "''Kira''" (derived from the Japanese pronunciation of the word "''Killer''"), is located in Japan. L also concludes that Kira can kill people without laying a finger on them. Light realizes that L will be his greatest nemesis, and a game of psychological [[Wiktionary:cat and mouse game|cat and mouse]] between the two begins.

==Characters==
<!-- Not too much spoilers, please! This article must only show a GLIMPSE of the story, not deliver it all in a plate, for more information, other pages were created. -->

{{Main|List of Death Note characters}}

===Main characters===
;<span id="Light"/>{{Nihongo|Light Yagami (Kira)|夜神 月|Yagami Raito}}
:The protagonist of ''Death Note'', Light is an extremely intelligent but bored 17-year old student. When he finds the Death Note, dropped in the human world by Ryuk, he decides to use it to kill all criminals and earns the title ''Kira''. His ultimate goal is to cleanse the world of evil to create a [[utopia]] and then reign over this new world as its [[God]]. He calls himself Justice.

;<span id="L"/>{{Nihongo|L|エル|Eru}}
:L is the world's three top-rated detectives (through two additional aliases), tasked with tracking down and arresting Kira. As such, he is Light's arch-enemy. His disheveled appearance masks his great powers of deduction and insight. L has many quirks, such as sitting in an odd manner (he squats on the edge of his seat, with his knees up by his chin), snacking on sweets in the middle of meetings, and holding his cellphone and other objects in a peculiar manner. He often takes drastic strategies to confuse and force his opponents, and on several occasions he has willingly disclosed several of his weaknesses to Kira at the risk of his own life in the hopes that he would lure him into a trap.

;<span id="Misa"/>{{Nihongo|Misa Amane|弥 海砂|Amane Misa}}
:A girl with an immense crush on Kira, Misa is a popular [[Japanese idol|idol]] in [[Japan]], and tends to wear clothing in many different styles, depending on what she is doing. She is immature and tends to refer to herself in the third person in an attempt to be cute. Misa is completely devoted to Light, and she once said that she loved him at first sight. Light, however, only views her as an asset to his plans because of her Death Note and her [[Shinigami eyes|''Shinigami'' eyes]] (that she obtained at the cost of half of her remaining life span, twice). The murderer of Misa's parents had been punished by Kira, explaining her later devotion to him.

;<span id="Mello"/>{{Nihongo|Mello|メロ|Mero}}
:Mello was an orphan who grew up with Near in Watari's shelter for gifted children. Like Near, Mello was one of the candidates to become L's successor. Similar to L's fondness for sweets, he is often seen eating bars of chocolate. Although Mello is quite intelligent, he often lets his emotions get the better of him. Mello wears leather most of the time, unlike Near or L. He also appears to be less secluded in terms of his friends and hobbies, and seems to be fond of biking. When Mello is first released - Light tries to find and kill him, which he manages to escape - but due to an explosion, he is left with a scar over the left side of his face.

;<span id="Near"/>{{Nihongo|Near|ニア|Nia}}
:Near was a primary candidate to become L's successor and calls himself N during the course of his investigations. He shares a number of similarities with L. Much like how L plays with things such as sugar cubes and forks, Near is frequently shown playing with toys or his hair. Near also sits in an unusual manner similar to L, but with some slight differences. He offered to join forces with Mello to fight Kira, but Mello turned him down. Near then gained the support of the US government and formed the Secret Provision for Kira (SPK).

;<span id="Teru"/>{{Nihongo|Teru Mikami|魅上 照|Mikami Teru}}
:Mikami is selected as the fourth Kira by Light, after Light decides that it is too dangerous for the Death Note to be near Misa or himself, since he and Misa are currently under surveillance by Aizawa and Mogi. A prosecuting attorney and adamant supporter of Kira, Mikami shares many of the same ideals, thoughts, and priorities as Kira, and is ecstatic when he discovers that Kira, his God, has chosen him, proving that God is on his side and watching. He is completely devoted and loyal to Kira, believing that divine justice must be brought down upon the people. Little is known about his personal life; he appears to have no hobbies or anything else of the sort. He chants<!-- 


Do NOT change his chant to "elimination", delete is what's used in the English manga. Thank you.


--> "delete" with each name he writes down in the Death Note due to events in his past when he thought God was "deleting" the evil people in his life. He, like Misa, has made the exchange of half his remaining years for [[Shinigami eyes|''Shinigami'' eyes]].

===Shinigami (The Death Gods)===
;<span id="Ryuk"/>{{Nihongo|Ryuk|リューク|Ryūku}}
:The original ''[[shinigami]]'' who dropped the Death Note in the human world, which Light would pick up. Acting out of pure boredom, Ryuk begins the story of Death Note on a whim. It is stated that Ryuk found the second Death Note in the ''shinigami'' world. Ryuk is not Light's ally, and in fact declares in their first meeting that some day he (Ryuk) would write Light's name into his own Death Note, killing him. Ryuk often refuses to aid Light and instead enjoys watching him struggle for his goal. He acts for his own interests and entertainment, and often fails to tell Light key details about the Death Note. However, Ryuk will aid Light if it serves his own goals, such as providing amusement or obtaining apples, without which he suffers a form of [[Withdrawal|withdrawal symptoms]].

;<span id="Rem"/>{{Nihongo|Rem|レム|Remu}}
<!-- Rem is female. She is the only female Death God we know of, but she is indeed female, so please do not change this section again to imply that she is male. It will be considered vandalism. Thank you. -->
:The female ''[[shinigami]]'' who first gives Misa her Death Note and [[Shinigami eyes|''Shinigami'' eyes]]. Similar to Ryuk, Rem possesses two Death Notes; however, she purposely gives one of them to Misa Amane. Rem inherited her second Death Note from Jealous, another ''shinigami'' who died when he saved Misa's life, and thought it only right to pass it on to Misa. Oddly enough, Rem inherits Jealous' love for Misa as well and is prompt to defend Misa even at the cost of her life. She shows this when she openly shows her lack of trust for Light, stating that she will kill him if Misa dies before her time.

==Death Note==
A Death Note is a book held by a ''[[shinigami]]'' which has the power to kill people if certain conditions are met. All Death Notes follow a long set of specific rules, and the writer revealed a few of these rules with each volume of the manga in Japan.

===Rules of the Death Note===
{{Main|Rules of the Death Note}}

====Written rules====
Before releasing his Death Note into the human world, Ryuk wrote some of the more basic rules on the first page in [[English language|English]], because he believed that English was the most popular language in the world. The rules written by Ryuk are the following:
<!-- NOTE: All of the rules that belong in this section are here. Please do not add any other rules to this section, or remove any of them. Thank you.!-->
*The human whose name is written in this note shall die.
*This note will not take effect unless the writer has the subject's face in their mind when writing his/her name. Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected.
*If the cause of death is written within 40 seconds of writing the subject's name, it will happen.
*If the cause of death is not specified, the subject will simply die of a heart attack. 
*After writing the cause of death, the details of the death should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds.

Each volume of the manga has a page containing new rules or possible uses for the ''Death Note''. In the anime series, each [[eyecatch]] contains a different rule written in both English and [[Japanese language|Japanese]], similar to how they were revealed in the Japanese manga. Two new rules are revealed in almost every episode.

====False rules====
In addition to these original rules, Light persuaded Ryuk to add a set of fake rules to mislead L and company. The reason behind this was to remove all suspicion of him and Misa being Kira and the Second Kira and preventing L from destroying the Death Note.

*If the owner of the Death Note does not kill within 13 days of the last entry, he or she will die.
*If the Death Note is burnt, destroyed, or otherwise damaged in any way, all those who have touched that Death Note will die.

==Media==
''Death Note'' began as a manga series which was later adapted to become a set of live-action films, an anime based on the manga, and a light novel.  Two games have also been released for the [[Nintendo DS]] in Japan.

A ''Death Note'' [[video game]] developed and published by [[Konami]] for the [[Nintendo DS]], entitled {{Nihongo|'''''Death Note Kira's Game'''''|デスノート キラゲーム|Desu Nōto Kira Gēmu}}, was released on [[February 15]] [[2007]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Death Note Ads Starting To Make Their Way Into Magazine Pages|url=http://ds.qj.net/category/Death-Note/cid/2230|work=[http://www.qj.net/ QJ.net]|date=[[2006]]-[[08-19]]|accessdate=2006-12-18}}</ref> 
''Kira Game'' is a strategy game where the player takes on the role of Kira or L. These are just titles, as any character can be Kira or L. The player will attempt to deduce who their enemy is (Kira will try to uncover L's identity and vice versa). This will play out in 3 phases: Investigation, where the player will discuss the case and clues with other characters; Voting, where each member of the investigation team casts a vote on who they suspect is L or Kira based on the player's performance in the previous phase; L/Kira, where the player can either focus their investigation on one member to see if they are Kira (L part) or force a member off of the team (Kira part).<ref name="game">{{cite web|title=Official Konami Website for Death Note|url=http://www.konami.jp/gs/game/deathnote/|publisher=Konami|accessdate=2007-02-03|language=Japanese}}</ref> The gameplay is very similar to that of the common party game [[Mafia (game)|Mafia]].

A sequel to the game, {{Nihongo|'''''Death Note L o Tsugumono'''''|デスノート Lを継ぐ者|Desu Nōto Eru o Tsugumono|lit. "Death Note: Successor to L"}}, was released in Japan on [[July 12]] [[2007]]. The storyline is based on the second part of the manga, featuring characters such as Mello and Near.<ref name="game"/>

Several characters from ''Death Note'' appear in ''[[Jump Super Stars]]'' and ''[[Jump Ultimate Stars]]'', a fighting game featuring a plethora of characters from [[Weekly Shonen Jump|''Shonen Jump'']] titles. Light, Ryuk and L appear in ''Jump Super Stars'' as support characters. In ''Jump Ultimate Stars'' Misa, Near, and Mello are added as support characters as well.

===Soundtracks===
{{Main|Death Note original soundtracks}}
There have been several soundtracks released for this series, such as the ones for the movie adaptations and also for the anime adaptation.

==Controversy==
===People's Republic of China===
Some schools in [[Shenyang]], [[People's Republic of China]] have banned the manga after some of their students started to tease friends and teachers by altering a [[notebook]] to resemble a Death Note and writing their names in them.<ref name="shenyang">{{cite news|title=Death Note Stirs Controversy in China|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/article.php?id=6111|accessdate=2006-11-07|date=[[2006]]-[[02-06]]|work=[[Anime News Network]]}}</ref>

The newspaper ''Shenyang Night Report'' called ''Death Note'' "poison, creating wicked hearts".<ref name="shenyang"/> Others however, including one major Chinese newspaper, felt that the ban is an overreaction and is inappropriate.<ref name="shenyang"/>

[[Beijing]] also has a ban on "horror stories" around schools to protect the "physical and mental health" of students, which includes local adaptations of ''Death Note''.<ref name="Beijing">{{cite news|title=Beijing bans scary stories to protect young|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSPEK30969020070515|accessdate=2007-05-15|date=[[2007]]-[[05-15]]|work=[[Reuters]]}}</ref> [[China]] itself is likewise trying to weed out pirated copies of the books and television series, as well other Japanese horror magazines, where no legal publication house prints it. Wang Song of the National Anti-piracy and Anti-pornography Working Committee has said that the series "misleads innocent children and distorts their mind and spirit".<ref name="China Daily">{{cite news|title='Death Note' days numbered|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-05/26/content_880773.htm|accessdate=2007-05-27|date=[[2007]]-[[05-26]]|work=[[China Daily]]}}</ref>
