{{nihongo|'''Link'''|リンク|Rinku}} is a [[video game character]] and [[protagonist|hero]] of [[Nintendo]]'s [[The Legend of Zelda (series)|''The Legend of Zelda'' video game series]] created by [[Shigeru Miyamoto]]. ''The Legend of Zelda'' is one of Nintendo's flagship game franchises, a franchise which has sold over 47 million copies worldwide [[as of 2006]].<ref>{{cite web|author=David|publisher=Australia's PAL Gaming Network|year=2005|url=http://palgn.com.au/article.php?id=3605&sid=4cea9e5e814470cb7ea6fd462d04a13e|title=Nintendo reveal sales figures|accessdate=February 12|accessyear=2006}}</ref> Their enduring popularity has led to many incarnations of the ''The Legend of Zelda'' story and of its Link character. The character's first appearance took place in the 1986 video game ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', where he was portrayed by a two-dimensional [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]; in later releases Link's appearance has been conveyed by a three-dimensional [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated image]]. The character Link has been featured in other video games from Nintendo, on Nintendo's merchandising, on comic books, and even on a television show about ''The Legend of Zelda'' series. Link was also honored with a star in [[Walk of Game]] in 2005.

In the games, Link is described as a young man who lives in the land of [[Hyrule]]. His age varies from game to game. He is also one of the few left-handed protagonists in video games (with the exception of his appearance in the [[Wii]] version of ''Twilight Princess'', where he is right-handed for control purposes).<ref name="miyamoto right link">{{cite web | last=Casamassina | first=Matt | authorlink=Matt Casamassina | date=[[2006-09-20]] | url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/733/733762p1.html | title=Miyamoto Talks Righty Link | publisher=IGN|accessdate=2006-09-20}}</ref> Coincidentally, the name 'Link' is Germanic for "left hand."

Link often journeys through the realm of [[Hyrule]], defeating evil forces and Hyrule's nemesis [[Ganon]], also known as Ganondorf. To defeat Ganon, Link needs the mystical [[Master Sword]] usually obtained after many trials and battles using other swords and shields, as well as auxiliary weaponry such as boomerangs, bombs, bows and arrows. Although young, Link is portrayed as a great courageous warrior who has (or develops, depending on the game) a close relationship with [[Princess Zelda]], whom he inevitably rescues. In several games in the series, Link must learn how to play a musical instrument that usually features in the game's plot and can magically unlock several spells.

==Conception and creation==
[[Image:Zelda Wind Waker Link waves goodbye.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Link, on board a pirate ship with Tetra, waves goodbye to his home.]]
The character has been a silent protagonist, or portrayed with no spoken dialogue, throughout almost the entire game series. Facial expressions were only used when the series arrived on the [[Nintendo 64]]. [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] has said in interviews that his conceptualization of ''The Legend of Zelda'' series and of Link was based on his childhood memories of him adventuring in the woods near his town, as well as books, movies and stories. In one of the interviews, he mentions attempting to make people identify with Link and have the opportunity to be heroes like the character. The games conform to his view: although at the end of some games Link becomes vastly talented in physical and magical arts, Link usually starts as a regular boy at the beginning of the game. An example is Link's appearance in ''Ocarina of Time'' in which he starts as an orphaned Hylian boy and ends as the legendary Hero of Time.<ref name="origin">{{cite web | url=http://www.miyamotoshrine.com/theman/interviews/230403.shtml|title=Shigeru Miyamoto Interview| date=[[2003-04-23]] | publisher=Superplay Magazine | author=Superplay Editorial Staff| accessdate=2006-09-24}}</ref> 

===Character creation===
The original game for the [[NES]] was developed at the same time as ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', by the same team and had ideas borrowed from one another during their [[Super Nintendo]] and [[Nintendo 64]] incarnations.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.miyamotoshrine.com/theman/interviews/1096.shtml | title=Miyamoto Interview| date=[[1996-10-01]] | publisher=Nintendo Power | author=Nintendo Power Editorial Staff| accessdate=2006-09-23}}</ref> Creator Shigeru Miyamoto developed the game and was in charge of deciding which concepts were "''Zelda'' ideas" or "''Mario'' ideas". Unlike ''Mario'', ''Zelda'' was made non-linear and focused on thought-provoking riddles and puzzles.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ntsc-uk.com/feature.php?featuretype=int&fea=ShigeruMiyamoto|title=Shigeru Miyamoto Interview| date=[[2005-01-01]] | publisher=ntsc-uk | author=Ben Bufton| accessdate=2006-09-23}}</ref> 

There have been several different "Links" in the history of Hyrule, the land where the ''Zelda'' series takes place. The existence of multiple Links is made obvious on many occasions in the games; for example, the introduction sequences of ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker|The Wind Waker]]'' and ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap|The Minish Cap]]'' refer to an ancient, legendary champion who is identical in appearance to Link, and ''The Wind Waker'' directly mentions the "Hero of Time" (a title given to Link in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time|Ocarina of Time]]'') as a historical entity. Shigeru Miyamoto has stated, "For every ''Zelda'' game we tell a new story, but we actually have an enormous document that explains how the game relates to the others, and bind them together. But to be honest, they are not that important to us. We care more about developing the game system... give the player new challenges for every chapter that is born."<ref name="origin">{{cite web | url=http://www.miyamotoshrine.com/theman/interviews/230403.shtml | title=Shigeru Miyamoto Interview| date=[[2003-04-23]] | publisher=Superplay Magazine | author=Superplay Editorial Staff| accessdate=2006-09-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.digitaltrends.com/featured_article58.html | title=Gaming Legend Shigeru Miyamoto Speaks| date=[[2006-06-19]] | publisher=Digital Trends | author=Chris Zimmerman| accessdate=2006-09-20}}</ref>  Miyamoto has also confirmed that there have been multiple Links in different times in Hyrule. However, the exact [[chronology]] of the ''Zelda'' series and the lineage of the various Links, though written down by Miyamoto and his team, has never been released in detail. Some major fansites have attempted to construct a coherent Link timeline based on available information, but with little success.<ref>{{cite web|author=Cory Faller|publisher= N-Sider|date=January 1, 2005|url=http://www.n-sider.com/articleview.php?articleid=248&page=1|title=The Legends of Zelda|accessdate=September 28|accessyear=2006}}</ref> Miyamoto has stated that ''Ocarina of Time'' is the first story, followed by ''Majora's Mask'', then the original ''Legend of Zelda'', then ''Zelda II: The Adventure of Link'', and finally ''A Link to the Past'', with ''Link's Awakening'' falling sometime after ''A Link to the Past''.<ref>{{cite web|author=|publisher= Nintendo Power|date=November 19, 1998|url=http://www.miyamotoshrine.com/theman/interviews/111998.shtml|title=Miyamoto Interview|accessdate=October 7|accessyear=2006}}</ref> However, it is important to note that Miyamoto made this statement before some games in the series (such as ''[[The Minish Cap]]'' and ''[[Twilight Princess]]'') were released. 

On the design of Link in ''The Wind Waker'', Miyamoto explained, "Link was a young boy and trying to create a very active and very energetic young boy and trying to choose the right style for portraying the young boy in a game like that we tried many different experiments. The ultimate decision we came to was that the cel-shading in ''The Wind Waker'' was the best option for expressing that."<ref name="Eree">{{cite web|author=IGN Staff|publisher= IGN|date=May 12 2004|url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/514/514589p1.html|title=E3 2004: Miyamoto and Aonuma on Zelda|accessdate=September 23|accessyear=2006}}</ref> ''The Wind Waker'' takes place with a new Link centuries after the victory of Link in ''Ocarina of Time''.<ref>{{cite web|author=|publisher= Nintendo of Japan|date=May 12 2004|url=http://www.gamecubicle.com/interview-legend_of_zelda_wind_waker_miyamoto.htm|title=windwaker interview|accessdate=September 28|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

There is speculation that the movie [[Ladyhawke]] has inspired the latest game of the series ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess]]'', Miyamoto denied that there was any relation, commenting that "We thought that by adding these animals it would help us create a larger and more realistic world."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/617/617000p1.html|title=Gaming Legend Shigeru Miyamoto Speaks| date=[[2005-05-19]] | publisher=IGN.com | author=Matt Casamassina| accessdate=2006-09-23}}</ref> ''Twilight Princess'' also incorporates a switch of focus from young Link growing up to a teenage Link, which lead to various designs and features around this idea.<ref name="Eree">{{cite web|author=IGN Staff|publisher= IGN|year=May 12th, 2004|url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/514/514589p1.html|title=E3 2004: Miyamoto and Aonuma on Zelda|accessdate=September 23|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

===Actor portrayal===
In the 3D games, beginning with ''[[Ocarina of Time]]'', Link has been voiced by four actors; [[Nobuyuki Hiyama]] for adult Link, [[Fujiko Takimoto]] for young Link, [[Sachi Matsumoto]] as Link in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker]]'' and [[Akira Sasanuma]] as Link
in ''[[Twilight Princess]]'', but because no ''Zelda'' game to date contains substantial spoken dialogue, the part consists only of short phrases, grunts, battle cries, screams, and other brief vocalizations.<ref name="staff">{{cite web | url=http://www.miyamotoshrine.com/theman/interviews/0898.shtml | title=Miyamoto Interview| date=[[1998-08-01]] | publisher=Nintendo Power | author=Nintendo Power Editorial Staff| accessdate=2006-09-23}}</ref> In ''The Wind Waker'', however, Link says the phrase "Come on!" when the player beckons certain characters to follow them in certain dungeons. Voice acting in the series has been limited since the gamemakers feel that players have their own ideas about how Link is supposed to sound and they wish to avoid a backlash.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.miyamotoshrine.com/theman/interviews/0898.shtml | title=Miyamoto and Aonuma Interview| date=[[2002-12-04]] | publisher=IGN | author=IGN Editorial Staff| accessdate=2006-09-23}}</ref> There was also a professional katana stunt man who performed motion capture for ''Ocarina of Time''.<ref name="staff">{{cite web | url=http://www.miyamotoshrine.com/theman/interviews/0898.shtml|title=Miyamoto Interview| date=[[1998-08-01]] | publisher=Nintendo Power | author=Nintendo Power Editorial Staff| accessdate=2006-09-23}}</ref> In the animated television series, Link is voiced by [[Jonathan Potts]].

==Characteristics==
According to the official Zelda.com Encyclopedia, Link is "humble", but also possesses legendary bravery, an attribute consistent with his role as the rightful bearer of the Triforce of Courage. The character is known in later ''Zelda'' games as the "Hero of Time" in his ''[[Ocarina of  Time]]'' incarnation,<ref name="pedia">{{cite web | url=http://www.zelda.com/universe/pedia/l.jsp |author= Nintendo| title=The Great Hyrule Encyclopedia - Link | publisher=Zelda Universe |year=January 1, 2006| accessdate=2005-09-20}}</ref>and as the "Hero of Winds" in his ''[[The Wind Waker]]'' incarnation. In [[Twilight Princess]], Link is  known as the "Hero Chosen by the Gods." In the video games he is presented as being a stoic and polite young man, a contrast to his first fully-voiced incarnation in the non-canonical Zelda television series in which he was portrayed as a whiny and lovesick teenager.

[[Image:ZeldaOOT Link Playing Ocarina.jpg|thumb|Adult Link playing the Ocarina of Time in [[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time|the game of the same name.]]]]
He is the rightful bearer of the [[Master Sword]], a powerful and magical sword he wields to defeat the forces of evil. Link does show rare moments of overzealous boldness, such as when he twice attempts to confront [[Ganon]] in ''The Wind Waker'' whilst ill equipped to defeat him. Also, he inadvertently helped Ganondorf find the [[Triforce]] in ''Ocarina of Time'', forcing Link to undo the damage he had caused, and eventually make things better than they were originally.<ref name="pedia">{{cite web | url=http://www.zelda.com/universe/pedia/l.jsp |author= Nintendo| title=The Great Hyrule Encyclopedia - Link | publisher=Zelda Universe |year=January 1, 2006| accessdate=2005-09-20}}</ref> Although ''Zelda'' games feature more interaction with friendly or neutral non-player characters (NPCs) than some [[action-adventure game]]s, such as the [[Metroid series|''Metroid'' series]], these characters rarely take an active part in Link’s quest which he completes alone. Link is shown to have several family members, such as an uncle in ''A Link to the Past'', an unseen mother in ''Ocarina of Time'' who died fleeing the ravages of war, a grandmother in ''The Wind Waker'' who raises him in his parents' unexplained absence, a grandfather from ''The Minish Cap'', and the most developed of Link's relatives, his sister Aryll who plays a critical role in the plot of ''The Wind Waker''. He also has several friends, such as the pirate captain Tetra from ''The Wind Waker'', Tatl the Fairy from ''Majora's Mask'', the Fairy [[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time characters#Navi|Navi]] from ''Ocarina of Time'', Ezlo the Minish from ''The Minish Cap'', and Ilia from ''Twilight Princess''. He also has a [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] relationship with [[Midna]] from ''Twilight Princess'', but eventually comes to care for Midna as a friend.<ref name="gamein">{{cite web | url=http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200505/N05.0525.1742.45225.htm | last=Berghammer | first=Billy | title=Zelda's Twilight Prince: The Eji Aonuma Interview | publisher=Game Informer|date=[[2005-05-25]] | accessdate=2006-09-24}}</ref> His mother and father also appear as spirits in the ''A Link to the Past'' manga.<ref name="manga">{{cite web|author=|publisher=Zelda Shrine|year=January 1, 2006|url=http://zs.ffshrine.org/link-to-the-past/manga.php|title=Zelda a Link to the Past - Manga / Comics|accessdate=September 29|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

===Epona===
Epona is Link's horse in the Zelda games. In Ocarina of Time, she is obtainable by beating Ingo in racing twice as adult Link. In Twilight Princess, you may change Epona's name and you possess her from the very beginning. Epona is also the name of the [[Epona|Gaulish goddess of horses]]. A horse resembling Epona also appears in [[The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures|Four Swords Adventures]], although there are often more than one horse for the four Links, so Epona's name is never used.

===Physical appearance===
Link appears as a young member of the [[Hylian]] race. It is unlikely that his age ever exceeds 17 to 19 years at any point in the series, and he appears first as a child in most games. Apparently, in most games he is around the age of 10. Every Link wears a green tunic, an undershirt (usually white, brown, or green, though Young Link from ''Ocarina of Time'' does not wear one), and a long, floppy green hat. In ''The Wind Waker'', if the game is beaten one time, Link stays in his island outfit the second time. It is also a common sight to see him wearing light-colored (usually white or tan) pants or tights, although he has appeared barelegged in other games. Link’s hair is usually dark blond but was originally brown. Link's eyes are most commonly blue, but are green in some games. Link has long pointed ears resembling some conceptions of [[Elf|elves]]. These are apparently a distinctive trait of the Hylian race (and their descendants), which supposedly allows them to hear messages from the gods. Link is apparently quite handsome; in Ocarina of Time, the shopkeeper at the ghost shop says to Link, "You are a handsome man, if I looked as good as you, I could run a different kind of business... heh heh heh!". Also, in [[Twilight Princess]], Link could gain some fans in the form of three young girls upon successfully beating the STAR minigame. When walking past them after doing so they would stalk him while keeping their distance until he walked off-screen or talked to them. When talked to they would scream "EEK!! It's him!", huddle together like schoolgirls (dropping 3 hearts while they did so) and then run away. In ''[[Twilight Princess]]'', Link wears a visible [[chainmail]] shirt underneath his tunic. Older Links usually wear small silver or blue hoop earrings, as is the Hylian fashion. However, in episode 4 of the Adult Saga in the official ''[[Ocarina of Time]]'' manga series, "Link Vs. Link", Impa is seen giving a Link his earrings, describing it as a "rite of passage for young [[Sheikah]] men".<ref>{{cite web|author=|publisher=zeldalegacy.net|year=January 1, It should also be noted that many girls are attracted to Link either because of his looks or his selfless acts and character.
2006|url=http://zeldalegacy.net/cpg/thumbnails.php?album=71|title=Chapter 10 - Link vs. Link|accessdate=September 29|accessyear=2006}}</ref> He also bears a Triforce mark on his left hand, marking him as the one who will find the Triforce of Courage.<ref name="iiinstructions">{{cite book | year=1997 | editor=Nintendo | title=Zelda II: The Adventure of Link instruction manual | pages= | publisher=Nintendo | language=English|id=}}</ref> When he transforms into an animal in the twilight realm in ''Twilight Princess'', he becomes a wolf, reflecting the mystical aspects of the transformation and his heroism.<ref name="gamein" /> However, when entering the Dark World in [[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past|A Link to the Past]] without the Moon Pearl, he is seen as a bunny, reflecting his innocence and virtue.

===Forms===
[[Image:Linkandmida.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Midna with Link in his wolf form]]
Link often changes shape, be it by chance or to get past an obstacle. In [[A Link to the Past]] Link turned into a half-bunny, half-man when he entered the Dark World without the Moon Pearl. This also occurred when Link was hit by a star-like spell in certain dungeons like the Gargoyle's Domain (or "Blind's Hideout" as it is known by some) for instance, although the transformation is only temporary as it disolves after a few seconds or if Link is attacked. [[Majora's Mask]] featured a lot of transforming, using different masks. At the very beginning of Majora's Mask, Link was turned into a [[Deku#Deku|Deku]] by a [[Skull Kid]]. Link had to get the [[Musical_instruments_from_The_Legend_of_Zelda_series#Ocarina_of_Time|Ocarina of Time]] and learn a special song to turn human again. Link could later use a mask to turn into a Deku, as well as a [[Races_in_The_Legend_of_Zelda_series#Gorons|Goron]], a [[Races_in_The_Legend_of_Zelda_series#Zoras|Zora]], and even a powerful adult (Link only appeared as a child in that game) known as [[Fierce Deity Link]]. In ''[[Twilight Princess]]'' Link turned into a wolf. Early in the game he could only turn into a wolf in certain areas, and couldn't turn human again until he found enough Tears of Light. Later in the game he can turn back and forth from wolf to human once he obtained the [[Master Sword]].

===Skills===
Link is well known for making use of a variety of weapons and items, such as [[bomb]]s, a [[Recurring weapons and items from The Legend of Zelda series#Hook Devices|hookshot]] (two Clawshots in Twilight Princess), a [[boomerang]] (Gale Boomerang in Twilight Princess) , a bow and arrows, and pegasus boots that can make him run extremely fast. He also is extremely agile, being able to perform quick jumps and flips. When noting the amount of equipment Link carries with him, such acts of agility attest to his great physical strength. In addition to his peak physical condition, he also knows how to perform magic and is a skilled musician, being able to play instruments such as ocarinas, flutes, drums, guitar, and even grass. He is also renowned for his fighting skill, such as his incredible boomerang and bow accuracy and most notably his excellent swordsmanship. It also seems that Link shows a mastery of many types of combat (most well seen to pick up any weapon he picks up and demonstrates its use extremely well). Even without the use of a power bracelet or golden/silver gauntlets he is still very strong, strong enough to push/pull heavy blocks many times his size,     pull large chandeliers,  lift up heavy doors and most notibily render full speed charging Gorons, and the much bigger Dangoro, to a complete stop, lifting them up and tossing them to the side. Even when assisted by the Iron Boots, which only make Link's weight heavier (granting him sure-footing), Link still has to rely on his complete upper body strength while throwing them.  <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.zelda.com/universe/pedia/b.jsp |author=Nintendo|year=January 1, 2006| title=The Great Hyrule Encyclopedia - Boomerang | publisher=Zelda Universe | accessdate=2005-09-11}}</ref>

===Dexterity===

Link is [[left-handed]], although this detail has changed over time, with his sword hand being different between games. The most valued sword that Link has wielded is the Master Sword, which has appeared in multiple Legend of Zelda games. The instruction booklet for ''The Adventure of Link'' describes Link setting off “with a magical sword in his left hand and a magical shield in his right”.<ref name="iiinstructions">{{cite book | year=1997 | editor=Nintendo | title=Zelda II: The Adventure of Link instruction manual | pages= | publisher=Nintendo | language=English | id=}}</ref> In most games, he alternates hands, but this is due to sprite mirroring. It was originally attributed to a Hylian superstition concerning Death Mountain, a physical landmark in many games in the series.  According to tradition, a swordsman would always place his shield between himself and the mountain, to deflect the evil that spread from it.  When facing toward the player in ''The Legend of Zelda'', Link appears to be holding his shield with his right hand. Starting with ''The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening'', Link holds his sword in his left hand and his shield in his right, no matter what direction he is facing. This occurs in the left and right-looking sprites. In ''The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap'', however, Link returns to alternately holding his weapon in the right or the left hand, depending on his [[orientation]]. At the beginning of the ''Four Swords Plus'' (''Four Swords Adventures'') [[manga]], Link is referred to as the “left-handed hero” after defeating pirates that were raiding a Hylian town. In addition, Link's figurine description in ''The Wind Waker'' lists his "manual preference" as left. However, in the animated TV series, Link is [[right-handed]]. In the Wii version of ''Twilight Princess'', Link is right-handed to better fit the game's control scheme. Because of this, the maps in the Wii version have also been mirrored. Due to a normal control scheme, the GameCube version Link remained left-handed.<ref name="miyamoto right link">{{cite web | last=Casamassina | first=Matt | authorlink=Matt Casamassina|date=[[2006-09-20]] | url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/733/733762p1.html | title=Miyamoto Talks Righty Link | publisher=IGN | accessdate=2006-09-20}}</ref>

===Video games===
====1986&mdash;1996====
<!--These are ordered by release. Do not change their order.
These are intended to be descriptions of the Links' peculiarities - not summarizations of the entire games' stories.  Game summaries can be found at their main articles.-->
[[Image:Zelda 02.png|left|thumb|250px|Link's first appearance in [[The Legend of Zelda]] on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] released in 1986.]]
Link debuted with the [[February 21]], [[1986]] release of the video game ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' in [[Japan]]. Described as a "young lad" who saved [[Princess Zelda]]’s elderly nursemaid [[Impa]] from [[Ganon]]'s henchmen,<ref>Nintendo (1997). ''The Legend of Zelda'' instruction manual. (in English).</ref> Link assumes the role of the generic hero attempting to recover the pieces of the Triforce of Wisdom and rescue the Princess Zelda (and the kingdom of [[Hyrule]]) from the evil wizard Ganon, who has stolen the [[Triforce]] of Power.<ref>Nintendo (1989). ''The Legend of Zelda'' instruction manual, p. 3(in English).</ref>

In ''[[Zelda II: The Adventure of Link]]'', Link approaches his 16th birthday, Impa takes him to North Castle in [[Hyrule]], alarmed by the sudden appearance of a Triforce crest on the boy’s left hand. She shows him the true heiress of Hyrule, an older incarnation of Princess Zelda, trapped out of time in an [[eternal sleep]], lying on an altar in the castle. The old woman also tells Link the Legend of Zelda, an ancient tale about the division of the Triforce and the curse that was put upon the princess. Impa then gives Link six crystals, and a [[scroll]] written in an ancient Hylian tongue, which Link understands despite having never learned it. He reads that the mark on his hand is the sign that he was chosen to seek the third Triforce, [[Courage]], in the Great Palace in the Valley of Death. Link then begins a quest to place a crystal in each of six [[palace]]s in Hyrule, so that he can later penetrate unhindered into the magically protected Great Palace, claim the Triforce of Courage, reunite the three pieces of the Triforce, and awaken Zelda.<ref>{{cite book | year=1989 | editor=Nintendo | title=The Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link | pages=3-12 | publisher=Nintendo | language=English | id=}}</ref> All the while, he is attacked by the remains of a defeated Ganon's army, who believe that the only way to revive their leader is to sprinkle the blood of the one who killed him on his ashes.

In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past]]'', centuries before the events of ''The Legend of Zelda'', Ganon and his army of evil were banished into the Golden Land, the realm of the Triforce, by the Hylians, at the price of countless lives. The [[portal (fiction)|portal]] to this world was magically blocked by seven sages, and the lands behind that seal, which Hylians hoped would never be broken again, became known as the Dark World, as they were corrupted by Ganon’s malice. One day, when the Imprisoning War is all but forgotten, the land is plagued by sudden disaster, until the wizard [[Agahnim]] appears at the court of the king of Hyrule and quells the upheaval. Named chief advisor to the throne, he soon seizes power from the king and kidnaps six maidens, descendants of the sages who had sealed the entrance of the Dark World. The maidens are taken to the castle tower, and never seen again. Agahnim then begins a dark ritual to break the seal on the Dark World and unleash Ganon’s fury upon Hyrule. Princess Zelda herself descends from the seventh sage, and manages to send out a [[telepathy|telepathic]] call for help before being taken away. Link’s uncle heads for the royal castle first, but he is quickly dispatched. He leaves Link his sword and with his last breath imparts the sword-spin technique, and tells the player, "Link, Zelda is your.." before perishing, leading some to believe that Link and Zelda may be of the same bloodline( in the Japenese version he says "Link, Zelda is your destiny). However, he doesn't say this anymore in the [[Game Boy Advance]] version. The young hero then begins a journey to collect three magical [[Pendant]]s of Virtue, and claim the Master Sword as his own before finally facing Agahnim. 

In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening]]'', Link is returning to Hyrule on a ship, but Link’s ship is caught in a storm and wrecked. He washes up on the shore of a mysterious island called Koholint. A girl named [[Characters in The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening#Marin|Marin]], who strongly resembles Zelda, finds Link lying unconscious on the beach and brings him to her home. He awakens on a beach and meets a strange talking [[owl]] who tells him that the only way he can escape Koholint Island is by awakening the “Wind Fish”, a giant creature slumbering in a colossal [[Egg (biology)|egg]] in the center of the island.<ref>{{cite book | year=1993 | editor=Nintendo | title=The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening instruction manual | pages=41-42 | publisher=Nintendo | language=English | id=}}</ref>

In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]'', a Link has been raised as one of the [[Kokiri]], the “children of the forest”.  Unlike the other Kokiri, Link does not have a [[fairy]] companion, and is thus shunned by their self-proclaimed leader, Mido.<ref>'''Mido:''' Hey you! "Mr. No Fairy!"

A curse has been cast on the Deku Tree, and he asks Link to break it; while Link is successful in defeating the monsters inside the Tree, the Tree was doomed before Link started. Dying, the Deku Tree tells Link of the [[Triforce]] and directs Link to [[Hyrule Castle]], where he encounters [[Princess Zelda]]. She sends him on a mission to collect three Spiritual Stones and save Hyrule. Once Link obtains the Stones, he travels to the Temple of Time and opens the Door of Time with the Stones and the Ocarina of Time. He then draws the [[Master Sword]] from the Pedestal of Time. This action imprisons Link in the Sacred Realm for seven years so his body can mature, while [[Ganondorf]] takes control of Hyrule and seizes the [[Triforce]] of Power. Seven years after drawing the sword from the pedestal, Link is awakened as the Hero of Time by Rauru, Sage of Light. Link finds that much time has passed, and he has grown up. He sets off on a quest to cleanse the land of Ganondorf’s evil by awakening the Sages, who can seal Ganondorf in what used to be the Sacred Realm. Returning to the Kokiri Forest, he finds that none of his friends have grown up, and most now no longer recognize him. After the player completes the first dungeon in this phase of the game, the Deku Tree's successor, the Deku Sprout, reveals the hidden story of Link's past to him. The Kokiri never grow up; the reason Link has grown, while his Kokiri friends have not, is that he is actually a [[Hylian]], orphaned in the wars that raged before Hyrule was united.<ref>'''Deku Tree Sprout:''' Well, as you might have already guessed, you are not a Kokiri!

''[[The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask]]'' occurs after defeating [[Ganon]]dorf and being sent back in time to his childhood, Link leaves Hyrule to search for a lost friend (declared by the [[manga]] to be his old fairy companion, [[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time characters#Navi|Navi]], and the official Majora's Mask Player's Guide states "Months after parting with his fairy sidekick, Navi, in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Link sets off to find his missing companion," in the introduction). While riding deep in the Lost Woods, he is ambushed by a [[Skull Kid]] who is possessed by an evil artifact, [[Characters in The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask#Majora|Majora’s Mask]], and his horse, [[Epona]], is stolen along with the magical Ocarina. Chasing the Skull Kid, Link falls into a crevasse and arrives in a country called [[Termina]]. He must save this land from the evil of Majora’s Mask, which has drawn the moon into a decaying orbit, causing it to crash into Termina’s capital city in just three days. Link uses the Ocarina of Time (reclaimed early on) and the Song of Time, which sends him back in time and saves the game when he plays it, to relive these three days again and again in order to prevent the disaster. Along the way Link finds many magical masks of his own, a handful of which allow him to transform. Those masks can turn him into a rock-like [[The Legend of Zelda series races#Gorons|Goron]]; a petite, plant-like [[The Legend of Zelda series races#Deku|Deku Scrub]]; a graceful aquatic [[The Legend of Zelda series races#Zoras|Zora]]; or the Fierce Deity. In this game, Link never grows up in the traditional sense, but the dark power of the Fierce Deity’s Mask allows Link to assume a powerful adult form, “Fierce Deity Link”. This form is easily his largest, standing at least twice as tall as adult Link in ''Ocarina of Time''. Miyamoto mentioned that "we wanted Link to get inside of a wonderland, to experience the adventures and think hard about what he should do."<ref>{{cite web|author=Kris|publisher=GG8|year=November 12, 2000|url=http://www.miyamotoshrine.com/theman/interviews/111200.shtml|title=Miyamoto Interview|accessdate=September 24|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons]]'', the [[Triforce]] sends Link on a mission to another land, Holodrum, to stop the disruption of the seasons by the General of Darkness, [[Characters in The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages and Seasons#Onox|Onox]]. While there, it is his duty to protect the Oracle of Seasons (in disguise as a dancer), named [[Characters in The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages and Seasons#Din|Din]]. After Onox takes her by force and the seasons are thrown into chaos, Link sets out to rescue her with the aid of the Rod of Seasons, a magical staff which allows Link to control the four seasons.

In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages]]'', Link awakens one day in another land, Labrynna, where he has been sent by the magic of the Triforce. Upon his arrival he is tricked by [[Characters in The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages and Seasons#Veran|Veran]], the Sorceress of Shadows, into opening the seal protecting the Oracle of Ages, a singer named [[Characters in The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages and Seasons#Nayru|Nayru]]. Veran, possessing Nayru’s body and time-traveling powers, goes back in time to change the past and command the present. Link rushes to follow them to the past and save Nayru using the power of the [[The Legend of Zelda series weapons and items#Harp of Ages|Harp of Ages]], which, when played correctly, grants its user the ability to move back and forth through time. After exorcising Veran’s spirit from Nayru’s body, Link ascends her citadel to defeat the Spectre of Sorrow.

====2002&mdash;present====
[[Image:4swordsscreen.png|200px|left|thumb|''Four Swords'' is the first ''Zelda'' game where multiple players can control multiple Links.]]
In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past/Four Swords|The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords]]'', Zelda goes to the Sanctuary of the Four Sword with her friend Link to check on the seal containing the Wind Mage, [[Vaati]]. The seal has weakened, however, and Vaati emerges and kidnaps Zelda. Drawing the Four Sword from the pedestal where it had imprisoned Vaati, Link gets a splitting headache and passes out, awakening to find that the magical Four Sword has divided him into 2-4 identical Links (depending on the number of players). The first Link wears his traditional green outfit; the second, a red version; the third, blue; and the fourth purple. (In ''The Minish Cap'', it is revealed that these colors reflect the four elements with which the sword is imbued: wind, fire, water, and earth, respectively.) The Links must cooperate to overcome obstacles, collect keys, and storm Vaati’s Palace so they can rescue Zelda and seal the mage away again.<ref>{{cite web|author=|publisher=Zelda.com|year=January 1, 2002|url=http://www.zelda.com/gba/swords_legend.html|title=The Legend|accessdate=September 29|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

 His appearance is largely similar to previous incarnations.</center>

In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker]]'', set hundreds of years after ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time|Ocarina of Time]]'', the gods have flooded Hyrule. A new country has been formed, encompassing the islands of the Great Sea, which were once the highest mountaintops of Hyrule. The kingdom of old, lying dormant under the sea, is now a half-forgotten dream, barely surviving in ancient scrolls and old legends, which make reference to the Hero of Time, who is likely the Link in Ocarina of Time. In the beginning of the game, Link’s younger sister [[Characters in The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker#Aryll|Aryll]] is captured by the [[Helmaroc King]] (a giant masked bird), mistaken for someone else with golden hair and pointy ears. Link travels to all corners of the Great Sea to retrieve his sister and defeat the shadowy power in control of the bird. He finds his quest intertwines with rescuing Princess Zelda from Ganon's grasp, and Link becomes, after many trials, the “'''Hero of Winds'''”. Using the Wind Waker, a magical conductor’s [[Baton (conducting)|baton]], he borrows the power of the gods to aid him in his quest. The wand’s user interface is similar to that used for the ''Ocarina of Time'', but adds [[tempo]] as well as [[pitch (music)|pitch]] to form tunes.

In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures]]'', Zelda, who is worried about the seal on Vaati, goes with six other mystical maidens to check on the Sanctuary of the Four Sword, and Link accompanies her. But something goes horribly wrong, and a dark shadowy copy of Link attacks. Link is forced to draw the Four Sword to fight Shadow Link, but when he does, he once again splits into copies of himself, and Vaati escapes.<ref>{{cite web|author=Nintendo Power|publisher=Nintendo.com|year=June 7, 2004|url=http://www.nintendo.com/gamemini?gameid=m-Game-0000-1849&rp=1|title=The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure|accessdate=September 29|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

[[Image:linkmap.jpg|left|thumb|Link in ''The Minish Cap.'']]
In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap]]'', Link is a young boy living with his grandfather, the Master Smith of Hyrule. Link is a childhood friend of [[Princess Zelda]], and on the day of Hyrule’s yearly fair to celebrate the coming of the [[Races in The Legend of Zelda series#Minish (Picori)|Picori]], they go to join in the festivities. A mysterious stranger, [[Vaati]], shows up and wins the sword-fighting competition; each year the victor of this tournament has the honor of touching the sacred Picori Blade. This sword was a gift to the Hylians from the tiny Picori and was used long ago by a legendary hero (Thought to be Gustaf, the first King of Hyrule) to defeat the forces of darkness and seal them away in the Bound Chest.<ref>{{cite book | year=2004 | editor=Nintendo | title=The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap | pages=3-4 | publisher=Nintendo | language=English | id=}}</ref>  [[Vaati]] breaks the Picori sword, thinking that the Light Force (A third of the Triforce, most likely the Triforce of Wisdom) is in the chest.  However, the chest contains only monsters, which scatter across the land.  [[Vaati]] vanishes after turning [[Zelda]] to stone by use of a magic spell.  Link is then sent to meet with the local Minish, living in the Minish Woods, to repair the Picori Sword and break the curse on Zelda.  Along the way, he meets with the bird-like Ezlo, who takes the place of Link's cap.  After gathering all four elements (Earth, Fire, Water, and Wind) and reviving the Picori Sword to full strength, Link breaks the curse on Zelda and defeats Vaati.

[[Image:Zeldatpgcversion.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A gameplay screen showing Link getting ready to swing his sword by using L-targeting in the GameCube version of ''Twilight Princess''.]]
In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess]]'', Link is a young rancher leading a fairly normal life until five of his friends, Colin, Malo, Talo, Beth and Ilia, his closest friend, are kidnapped by monsters. Link’s rescue mission leads him into the Twilight Realm, a dark place that changes him into a wolf. While in this form, he is aided and ridden by Midna, an imp-like creature with a strange helmet on her head. In his attempt to save his friends, Link discovers an even greater evil that only he can stop.

''[[The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass]]'' is said to be aiming for a release in late 2007. It seems to revive the idea of a fairy companion as in ''Ocarina of Time''. A sequel to ''The Wind Waker'', it involves Link’s quest to reunite with Tetra after both are lost at sea in a mysterious fog.

===Other appearances===
Link is present in a number of games outside of the ''Legend of Zelda'' series.
While varying in their regard within the gaming community, each of these games contributes much to the series which would be considered ''The Legend of Zelda'' [[canon (fiction)|canon]].

====CD-i====
[[Image:Zeldafacesofevil2.jpg|left|thumb|A screenshot from ''The Faces of Evil''.]]
''[[Link: The Faces of Evil]]'', released in 1993 for [[Philips]]’ [[CD-i]] system, is the only one of the three Zelda games for the CD-i system in which Link is the protagonist. At the beginning of the game Link is visited by a wizard who tells him that Ganon and his servants have seized the peaceful island of Koridai and captured Zelda. After being informed that only he can defeat Ganon, Link travels to Koridai to find the magical artifact known as the ''Book of Koridai''. Using the Book, he defeats Ganon and frees Zelda. Although it features ''Zelda'' characters, this game was not produced by Nintendo, with supervision from Nintendo, or even for a Nintendo system. It has earned disfavorable reviews, particularly from ''Zelda'' fans, who do not consider it part of the ''Zelda'' series.

There were two other ''Legend of Zelda'' games released for the CD-i; ''[[Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon]]'' and ''[[Zelda’s Adventure]]''. However, in both games Princess Zelda was the protagonist, as both games' plots involve Link’s kidnapping.

====Super Smash Bros. series====
Link is one of eight characters available at the beginning of Nintendo’s 1999 fighting game, ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' Link sports his traditional green Kokiri tunic (the player can also choose from two alternate tunic colors inspired by Link's ''Ocarina of Time'' tunics: the red [[Recurring weapons and items from The Legend of Zelda series#Tunics|Goron Tunic]] and blue [[Recurring weapons and items from The Legend of Zelda series#Tunics|Zora Tunic]]; a purplish-white tunic inspired by the effect of the Blue Ring from the original ''Legend of Zelda''{{Fact|date=April 2007}}; and a black tunic representing [[Bosses in The Legend of Zelda series#Dark Link|Dark Link]]{{Fact|date=April 2007}}). He also has some of his usual arsenal from the ''Legend of Zelda'' series at his disposal, including bombs, his boomerang and a hookshot.

Link is also one of the 14 playable characters available from the start in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', the 2001 sequel to ''Super Smash Bros.'' In ''Super Smash Bros. Melee'', he has his bow <!-- (normal arrows, but if ‘charged’, they become light arrows) --><!--Does it say they’re light arrows in the game or the instruction booklet?-->in addition to the equipment he brought with him to the original ''Super Smash Bros''. Link is considered to be a mid-tier character. As a secret unlockable character, is '''Young Link''', the youthful Link from most of the games in the series. Modeled after the ''Ocarina of Time''/''Majora’s Mask'' version of the hero, Young Link is more agile but weaker than the older Link. 

On May 10, 2006, at an after-hours press conference during [[E³]], Link became one of the first confirmed fighters in the [[Wii]] installment of the franchise, ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]''. His appearance seems to be influenced by his character model from ''Twilight Princess''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Peer Schneider & Matt Casamassina|publisher=IGN|year=May 10, 2006|url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/707/707504p1.html|title=E3 2006: Super Smash Bros. Brawl|accessdate=September 23|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

====''Soul Calibur II''====

In the GameCube version of [[Namco]]’s ''[[Soul Calibur II]]'', the adult-style Link is a playable fighter. Not much is revealed about the incarnation of Link in this game, but it is known that, after saving Hyrule from an evil wizard who was being controlled by a fragment of [[Soul Edge]], he went on a quest to destroy the evil sword. Quickly pulling the Master Sword out of its pedestal, he set out to travel to this world to destroy Soul Edge, on a secret mission arranged by Princess Zelda. Miyamoto did not see a problem with Link appearing in what some had thought to be a "violent fighting game", since he had already been established as a fighter in the ''Super Smash Bros.'' games. The more realistic Link in this game was also used to help develop Link's ''Twilight Princess'' look.<ref>{{cite web|author=|publisher=Computer and Video Games|year=May 16, 2003|url=http://www.miyamotoshrine.com/theman/interviews/140503.shtml|title=The Miyamoto Interview |accessdate=September 24|accessyear=2006}}</ref>
In ''Soul Calibur II'', Link is the only character to use ranged weapons and the only guest character to have his own theme and more than three costumes (he starts with his traditional green Kokiri tunic and the red Goron Tunic; the blue Zora Tunic and purplish-white tunic are unlockable). His weapons are a number of weapons from the ''Zelda'' games.
In addition, Link's fighting style retains many of his signature moves from past games in the Zelda series, specifically with direct comparisons drawn from the ''Smash Bros. Melee'' iteration.

====Cameo appearances====
{{further|[[The Legend of Zelda series#References in other games|''The Legend of Zelda'' references in other games]]}}

Link appears sleeping in ''[[Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars]]''. He also appears in ''[[Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest]]'' and ''[[Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!]]'', with a reference to Link's collection of seashells in ''[[Link's Awakening]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Fryguy64|publisher=Nintendo Database|year=January 1, 2006|url=http://nindb.classicgaming.gamespy.com/sns/a3c_cam.shtml|title=Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble|accessdate=September 29|accessyear=2006}}</ref> Also, some of Link's weapons and items have shown up in different games, such as the [[Master Sword]] appearing in ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics Advance]]'' and ''[[Animal Crossing (series)|Animal Crossing]]''. Also featured in [[Animal Crossing (series)|Animal Crossing]] is a message displayed in random drawers of your neighbors' furniture.  It reads: "You found 100 rupees!  Too bad you can't use them here." Another reference to the Master Sword and Link's recurring quest of getting three divine items to acquire the Master Sword can be found in [[Hamtaro: Ham-Ham Heartbreak]]. In that game, a similar quest gets the player an item that, when drawn from the pedestal, turns out to be a giant spoon instead of a sword.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nindb.classicgaming.gamespy.com/agb/ah3.shtml|title="The Master Spoon"|publisher=nindb.classicgaming|accessdate=2007-02-24}}</ref> He is also parodied in ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' as a gnome named Linken.<ref>{{cite web|author=Paden Brown|publisher=gamewinners.com|year=January 1, 2006|url=http://www.gamewinners.com/game_boy_advance/FinalFantasyTacticsAdvance.htm|title=Hint: Legend Of Zelda reference: |accessdate=September 29|accessyear=2006}}</ref> ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' has been parodied in the ''[[WarioWare]]'' series.<ref>

====Other media====
[[Image:Zeed2.jpg|thumb|left|Link in the tv series]]
Link, as voiced by [[Jonathan Potts]], was featured in a set of [[The Legend of Zelda (TV series)|cartoons]] which aired from [[1989]] to [[1990]] as a part of [[DiC]]’s [[Super Mario Bros. television series|''The Super Mario Bros. Super Show'']]. Based loosely on the first game, the series presented Link as a rude, lovesick teenager, an image many find at odds with his silent persona from the video games. In this series, Link wields his sword in his right hand, unlike the video games in which Link is left-handed. Constantly pursuing Zelda and pursued by the fairy princess Spryte, this Link was known to beg kisses from Zelda, and, famously, to burst out “Well excuuuuuse me, Princess!” when fed up with Zelda’s attitude, very different from his polite and respectful attitude in the original games. Thirteen episodes were produced before the cancellation of ''The Super Mario Bros. Super Show''.<ref>{{cite web|author=|publisher=zeldalegacy.net|year=January 1, 2006|url=http://www.zeldalegacy.net/zelda-multimedia/zelda-videos/legend-of-zelda-cartoon-series--downloads.html|title= Legend of Zelda Cartoon Series & Downloads|accessdate=September 29|accessyear=2006}}</ref> The complete series was released [[October 18]], [[2005]] to very poor reviews.<ref>{{cite web|author=Matt|publisher=X-Entertainment|year=May 26, 2001|url=http://www.x-entertainment.com/messages/562.html|title=Captain N, The Game Master: Joins Link & Zelda For A Little Moblin Action in Hyrule!|accessdate=September 29|accessyear=2006}}</ref> A slightly altered version of this Link (and Zelda) appeared during the second season of ''[[Captain N: The Game Master]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Michael S.

Another version of Link was created as a serial comic for [[Nintendo Power]] magazine by acclaimed [[manga]] author [[Shotaro Ishinomori]], and later collected in graphic novel form. This told an alternate version of the events from ''A Link to the Past''. Though Link starts out a hapless, bumbling kid, caught up in something bigger than he ever imagined, he displays great courage and ultimately proves himself a determined and competent adventurer. Interestingly, he also has a fairy guide and companion, Epheremelda, long before this concept was introduced to the series. This telling portrays Link’s parents as Knights of Hyrule, lost to the Dark World. It also includes an original character, Roam, a descendant of the Knights of Hyrule who fought in the Imprisoning War. (Roam bears a striking resemblance to 002, a character from Ishinomori’s first successful creation, [[Cyborg 009]], whose real name, coincidentally, was Jet Link.) At the end of the story, Zelda has become Queen, and Link is head of the Royal Guard and the Knights of Hyrule. This success is bittersweet, as their duties keep them apart, even though they were once so close, sharing an adventure and even coming together in dreams.<ref name="manga">{{cite web|author=|publisher=Zelda Shrine|year=January 1, 2006|url=http://zs.ffshrine.org/link-to-the-past/manga.php|title=Zelda a Link to the Past - Manga / Comics|accessdate=September 29|accessyear=2006}}</ref> There have also been manga comics written around the original ''Legend of Zelda'', ''Ocarina of Time'', ''Majora's Mask'', ''Oracle of Seasons'' and ''Oracle of Ages''.<ref>{{cite web|author=|publisher=Zelda Shrine|year=January 1, 2006|url=http://www.zeldalegacy.net/zelda-literature--material/zelda-comics--manga/zelda-comics-and-manga.html|title=Zelda Comics and Manga|accessdate=September 29|accessyear=2006}}</ref>
