The '''Amos Tuck School of Business Administration''' is the [[Graduate school|graduate]] [[business school]] of [[Dartmouth College]] in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]], United States. Founded in 1900, Tuck is the oldest graduate school of business in the world, and was the first institution to offer master's degrees in business administration.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://alumni.yale.edu/clubs/fapn/2001_04_09_WSJ.html | title = And the Winner Is...

Tuck grants only one degree, the [[Master of Business Administration]], alongside shorter programs for executives and recent college graduates, as well as opportunities for dual degrees with other institutions. The school places a heavy emphasis on its tight-knit and residential character, and has a student population that hovers near 500 students and a full-time faculty of 46.<ref name="about tuck">{{cite web | url = http://www.tuck.edu/about/index.html | title = About Tuck | publisher = Tuck School of Business | accessdate = 2007-11-09 }}</ref> Tuck claims over 8,400 living alumni in a variety of fields, and currently enjoys the highest rate of alumni donation of any business school in the United States.

== History ==
[[Image:Amos tuck.jpg|thumb|right|[[Amos Tuck]], the namesake of the Tuck School]]
At the turn of the 20th century, Dartmouth College president [[William Jewett Tucker]] decided to explore the possibility of establishing a school of business to educate the growing number of Dartmouth alumni entering the commercial world.<ref name="jstor">{{cite web | url = http://www.jstor.org/view/00221546/di962315/96p0045s/0 | title = The Amos Tuck School of Business Administration: Its Origin and Present Program | first = Karl A. | last = Hill | date = December 1961 | work = Journal of Higher Education | vol = XXXII | accessdate = 2007-11-08 }}</ref> Turning to his former roommate from his undergraduate years at Dartmouth, Tucker enlisted the support of [[Edward Tuck]], who had since become a wealthy banker and philanthropist.<ref name="our history">{{cite web | url = http://www.tuck.edu/about/history/index.html | title = About Tuck: Our History | publisher = Tuck School of Business | accessdate = 2007-11-08 }}</ref> Tuck donated $300,000 in the form of [[preferred stock]] shares in a Minnesota railroad company as the capital to found the school. It was named the Amos Tuck School of Administration and Finance, after Edward Tuck's father and Dartmouth alumnus [[Amos Tuck]].<ref name="our history"/>

The new school's tuition fee cost $100 for the few students who enrolled in the first year; graduates of the two-year program received a Master of Commercial Science degree (MCS).<ref name="our history"/><ref name="tuck history timeline"/> The curriculum involved both traditional [[liberal arts]] fields as well as economic and finance education.<ref name="jstor"/> Undergraduate professors taught most of the first-year courses, while outside guest instructors and businesspeople educated students in their second years.<ref name="jstor"/><ref name="our history"/> As the nation's first graduate school of business, the Tuck School's emphasis on a broad education in general management was adopted by many other emerging business schools, and was dubbed the "Tuck Pattern".<ref name="jstor"/><ref name="our history"/>

In the late 1920s, Dartmouth president [[Ernest Martin Hopkins]] sought to unify the Tuck School by establishing a central campus, uniting the school's academic and residential facilities. Edward Tuck, then an aged man living in France, donated an additional $570,000 for the effort.<ref name="our history"/> Using primarily his funds, four new buildings were constructed in 1929 on the west side of campus.<ref name="dartmo-tuck">{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmo.com/buildings/tuvwxyzbldg.html#tuckhall2 | title = Tuck Hall (II) | work = Dartmo.: The Buildings of Dartmouth College | accessdate = 2007-10-02 }}</ref><ref name="our history"/>

In 1942, the school's name changed to the Amos Tuck School of Business Administration, and in 1953, the degree program changed to the modern [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA). Until the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Tuck School catered primarily to Dartmouth students, accepting undergraduates during their third year.<ref name="our history"/> Under Dean Karl Hill, Tuck shifted its focus to soliciting a national student body. The resulting expansion in the late 1960s saw additional growth of the campus with the construction of a new dormitory and the Murdough Center, which contains the Feldberg Business and Engineering Library. Under Deans Richard West (1976–1983) and Colin Blaydon (1983–1990), the school's curriculum and faculty expanded extensively, and applications increased by one-third.<ref name="our history"/> Since the late 1980s, Tuck has continued to expand in student body and faculty size, and has seen the establishment of two new campus buildings as well as several research centers and nondegree business programs.<ref name="tuck history timeline"/>

{{seealso|List of Dartmouth College buildings#Tuck School of Business}}
The Tuck School is located on the campus of [[Dartmouth College]], which is situated in the rural, [[Upper Valley (Connecticut River)|Upper Valley]] [[New England]] town of [[Hanover, New Hampshire]]. The campus of the Tuck School sits in a complex on the west side of Dartmouth's campus, near the [[Connecticut River]].<ref name="our_campus">{{cite web | url = http://www.tuck.dartmouth.edu/about/campus/index.html | title = Our Campus | publisher = Tuck School of Business | accessdate = 2007-11-06 }}</ref> Shortly after being founded in 1900, Tuck was housed in a single building across from [[The Green (Dartmouth College)|the Green]] at the center of the campus;<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmo.com/buildings/lmnopbldg.html#mcnutthall | title = McNutt Hall | work = Dartmo.: The Buildings of Dartmouth College | accessdate = 2007-11-06 }}</ref> in 1930, the institution moved into Stell, Chase, Tuck, and Woodbury Halls in its present location along the Tuck Mall.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmo.com/buildings/cdbldg.html#chasehouse | title = Chase House | work = Dartmo.: The Buildings of Dartmouth College | accessdate = 2007-10-02 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmo.com/buildings/qrsbldg.html#stellhall | title = Stell Hall | work = Dartmo.: The Buildings of Dartmouth College | accessdate = 2007-10-02 }}</ref><ref name="dartmo-tuck"/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmo.com/buildings/tuvwxyzbldg.html#woodburyhouse | title = Woodbury House | work = Dartmo.: The Buildings of Dartmouth College | accessdate = 2007-10-02 }}</ref> Today, these original structures serve as four of Tuck's six academic and administrative buildings.<ref name="our campus"/>

Tuck emphasizes its residential character, describing residential life as "a foundation of the Tuck culture" and crediting it as "a reason that Tuck alumni are among the most loyal of all the business school [sic] in the world."<ref name="strategy">{{cite web | url = http://www.tuck.edu/about/strategy.html | title = About Tuck: Our Strategy | publisher = Tuck School of Business | accessdate = 2007-11-08 }}</ref><ref name="our campus"/> Tuck's isolated location has been described as an "image problem" for attracting successful applicants and faculty to its rural campus,<ref name="tuckies">{{cite news | url = http://www.careerjournal.com/specialreports/bschool03/articles/20020909-alsop-mbtuck.html | title = Dartmouth's Tuck School Keeps Challengers at Bay | first = Ronald | last = Alsop | publisher = CareerJournal.com: The Wall Street Journal Executive Career Site | year = 2003 | accessdate = 2007-11-08 }}</ref> although some students cite the insular location as a positive trait for fostering intimacy and friendship.<ref name="pr-sl&e">{{cite web | url = http://www.princetonreview.com/mba/research/profiles/studentsSay.asp?listing=1010998&category=6&LTID=2 | title = What Tuck Students Say About...

Currently, Tuck has two residential facilities: Buchanan Hall (constructed 1968) and Whittemore Hall (constructed 2000). Further, a new complex called the Tuck Living and Learning Complex that will house 85 additional students as well as classrooms and study space is currently under construction. At a total cost of $27.2 million, the Tuck LLC is expected to be ready for occupancy in December 2008.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~opdc/projects/llc/index.html | title = Tuck School Living and Learning Complex | publisher = Office of Planning, Design and Construction | accessdate = 2007-10-03 }}</ref> The Tuck School shares the Murdough Center (containing the Feldberg Business and Engineering Library) the with the adjacent [[Thayer School of Engineering]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tuck.dartmouth.edu/about/campus/murdough.html | title = About Tuck - Murdough Center | publisher = Tuck School of Business | accessdate = 2007-11-06 }}</ref> The Tuck campus is serviced by Byrne Hall, a dining facility operated by Dartmouth Dining Services.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~dds/text/byrnehall.shtml | title = Dining Locations - Byrne Hall | publisher = Dartmouth Dining Services | accessdate = 2007-11-06 }}</ref>

The Tuck School offers only a single degree: the two-year, full-time [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA). Students may specialize within the MBA in fields such as finance or marketing, but a specialization is not required for graduation.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tuck.dartmouth.edu/mba/academics/faqs.html | title = The Tuck MBA - Academic FAQs | publisher = Tuck School of Business | accessdate = 2007-11-06 }}</ref> First-year MBA students at Tuck undertake a 32-week core curriculum in general management and a specialized First Year Project.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tuck.dartmouth.edu/mba/academics/index.html | title = The Tuck MBA - Academics | publisher = Tuck School of Business | accessdate = 2007-11-06 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://oracle-www.dartmouth.edu/dart/groucho/tuck_mba_program.course_descriptions?p_what=FY | title = First-Year Courses | publisher = Tuck School of Business | accessdate = 2007-11-06 }}</ref><ref name="quick facts"/> During their second year, students take 12 elective courses and design their own focused field of study.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.princetonreview.com/mba/research/profiles/studentsSay.asp?listing=1010998&category=5&LTID=2 | title = What Tuck Students Say About...

The school stresses a collaborative and teamwork-based approach to learning, which it touts as one of its assets for "building the interpersonal skills required for business leadership."<ref name="strategy"/> However, this emphasis on cooperative group learning has been criticized as too "touchy-feely" for students entering the competitive business world, and the emphasis on consensus-building as detrimental to students' ability to make quick, independent decisions.<ref name="tuckies"/> The school's academic programs have also been criticized for not offering their students a broader international perspective, though the school has sought to remedy this by offering globally-oriented courses, programs, and research.<ref name="tuckies"/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.careerjournal.com/reports/bschool05/snapshot/dartmouth.html | title = Dartmouth College (Tuck) | publisher = CareerJournal.com: The Wall Street Journal Executive Career Site | year = 2005 | accessdate = 2007-11-11 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tuck.edu/mba/global/index.html | title = The Tuck MBA: Global View | publisher = Tuck School of Business | accessdate = 2007-11-11 }}</ref>

Students seeking other degrees can engage in one of seven dual-degree or joint-degree programs offered in conjunction with other academic institutions. Dual degrees include an MBA/Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy from [[The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]] at [[Tufts University]], an MBA/[[Master of Public Affairs]] from the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]], an MBA/Master of Studies in Environmental Law from the [[Vermont Law School]], and an MBA/[[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|Master of Arts]] from the [[Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. Joint degrees include a [[Doctor of Medicine]]/MBA from [[Dartmouth Medical School]], a [[Master of Public Health]]/MBA from the Dartmouth's Center for the Evaluative Clinical Sciences, and a Master of Engineering Management/MBA from Dartmouth's [[Thayer School of Engineering]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tuck.dartmouth.edu/mba/degrees.html | title = Joint & Dual Degrees | publisher = Tuck School of Business | accessdate = 2007-11-06 }}</ref> The school also offers a variety of second-year exchange programs at other institutions such as the [[Handelshochschule Leipzig]] in Germany, the [[HEC School of Management]] in Paris, [[IESE|IESE Business School]] in Barcelona, and the [[London Business School]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tuck.dartmouth.edu/mba/exchange_programs.html | title = Exchange Programs | publisher = Tuck School of Business | acccessdate = 2007-11-06 }}</ref>

In addition to the MBA program, the school also offers an array of executive education and other non-degree programs, such as the Tuck Business Bridge Program for current and recent university undergraduates, and the Leadership Education and Development (LEAD) program for high school students.<ref name="about tuck"/>

=== Organization and research ===
Like the undergraduate portion of Dartmouth College, the Tuck School operates on a [[Academic term|quarter system]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tuck.dartmouth.edu/mba/academic_calendar.html | title = Academic Calendar | publisher = Tuck School of Business | accessdate = 2007-11-06 }}</ref> As part of the larger institution, the Tuck School is ultimately administered by Dartmouth's President and [[Board of Trustees of Dartmouth College|Board of Trustees]]. The school is directly managed by a Dean (currently Paul Danos) who is advised by a Board of Overseers that was established in 1951.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tuck.dartmouth.edu/about/staff/overseers.html | title = Board of Overseers | publisher = Tuck School of Business | accessdate = 2007-11-06 }}</ref>
[[Image:Dartmouth College campus 2007-11-07 Feldberg Business & Engineering Library 02.JPG|thumb|left|The Feldberg Business and Engineering Library]]
Since the Tuck School offers only one degree, it does not contain formal academic departments as do other institutions. Instead, faculty are generally grouped in one or more of seven "academic areas": [[accounting]], [[finance]] and [[economics]], [[marketing]], [[operations management]] and [[management science]], strategy and management, [[international business]], and management communication.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tuck.dartmouth.edu/faculty/academic_areas.html | title = Academic Areas | publisher = Tuck School of Business | accessdate = 2007-11-06 }}</ref> Tuck is also home to five research centers which organize research in different fields of business administration. The centers are meant to promote faculty research, establish liaisons between the Tuck School and the corporate world, and sponsor programs for Tuck as a whole; MBA students are occasionally invited to participate as fellows and research associates.<ref name="tuck-rc">{{cite web | url = http://www.tuck.dartmouth.edu/faculty/research_centers.html | title = Research Centers | publisher = Tuck School of Business | accessdate = 2007-11-06 }}</ref> The five research centers are the William F. Achtmeyer Center for Global Leadership, the Center for Corporate Governance, the Center for International Business, the Center for Private Equity and Entrepreneurship, and the Glassmeyer/McNamee Center for Digital Strategies.<ref name="tuck-rc"/>
