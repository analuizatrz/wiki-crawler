{{nihongo|'''''Cowboy Bebop'''''|カウボーイビバップ|Kaubōi Bibappu}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[anime]] series created by [[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]]. Directed by [[Shinichiro Watanabe]] and written by [[Keiko Nobumoto]], it consists of 26 episodes (called "sessions") and one feature-length film.  It follows the adventures of a group of [[bounty hunter]]s traveling on their spaceship, the Bebop, in the year 2071.

''Cowboy Bebop'' was a commercial success both in [[Japan]] and worldwide, notably in the [[United States]]. After its commercial success, [[Sony Pictures Entertainment|Sony Pictures]] released the ''Cowboy Bebop'' movie, ''[[Cowboy Bebop: The Movie|Knockin' on Heaven's Door]]'' to theaters worldwide and followed up with an international [[DVD]] release. Two ''Cowboy Bebop'' manga series were adapted based on the anime, as well as two video games, one each for the [[PlayStation]] and [[PlayStation 2]] consoles.

''Cowboy Bebop'' has been strongly influenced by [[American music]], especially the [[jazz]] movements of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s and the early [[Rock and roll|rock]] era of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Many of its action sequences, from space battles to hand-to-hand [[martial arts]] [[combat]], are set and timed to music. Episodes are called ''Sessions'' (in reference to musicians playing a "jam session"), and titles are often borrowed from album or song names (such as ''[[Sympathy for the Devil]]'' or ''[[My Funny Valentine]]''), or make use of a genre name (''Mushroom Samba'' and ''Jupiter Jazz''), indicating the episode's musical theme.

==Plot==
{{see|List of Cowboy Bebop episodes}}

In the year 2071, the crew of the spaceship ''Bebop'' travel the [[solar system]] trying to apprehend bounties. In the slang of the era, "Cowboys" are bounty hunters. Most episodes revolve around a specific bounty, but the show often shares its focus with the pasts of one of each of the four main characters and of more general past events, which are revealed and brought together as the series progresses.

===Background===
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:BebopGateway.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Bebop emerges from a [[Hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]] gate.]] -->
In the year 2021, ring-shaped [[Hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]] gateways were constructed across the solar system, allowing easy [[interplanetary travel]]. Unfortunately, the gate network contained a fatal instability that was ignored by the contractors who built the system. The instability grew until a gateway near Earth exploded, releasing a powerful burst of energy that cracked the [[Moon]]. In a cataclysmic disaster referred to as "The Gate Accident", meteoric debris from the devastated Moon rained down on the planet, destroying much of Earth's surface. The death toll was by far the most catastrophic in recorded history; around 4.7 billion lives were lost in the initial incident alone. Decades later, debris from the disaster still falls on Earth with the same frequency as rainstorms ("rock showers" are a part of daily weather forecasts), forcing those remaining on Earth to live mostly underground. Most left Earth after the Gate Incident and spread out across the solar system, living in colonies on [[Venus (planet)|Venus]], [[Mars (planet)|Mars]], some habitable [[asteroid]]s, [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], and the [[Galilean moon|Galilean moons of Jupiter]], as well as many [[space station]]s and a penal colony on [[Pluto]]. As shown by posters and ads the solar community is very interracial and English, French, Hebrew, Spanish, Russian, Chinese and Japanese are some of the languages shown to be currently used. The total population of the solar system in 2071, when the series takes place, is only 1.5 billion.<ref>{{cite web |title= Essay: See You Space Cowboy |url=http://surbrook.devermore.net/adaptationsanime/bebop/cbseeyou.html | accessyear=2007 |accessmonthday=July 25}}</ref>

Many of [[Mars]]' [[impact crater]]s were domed and transformed into thriving metropolitan areas for those who could afford it. [[Venus (planet)|Venus]] was [[terraform]]ed, with oxygen provided by a species of oxygen-producing plants floating in the atmosphere. This is not a perfect process, however, since the spores of these plants cause “Venus Sickness” in some people. This condition, left untreated, may lead to blindness or death, and proper treatment is expensive. Many moons of Jupiter, such as [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]], [[Io (moon)|Io]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]],  and [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], have been terraformed and colonized with varying degrees of success. Callisto is a cold, inhospitable moon (with the entirely male city, Blue Crow), while Io is a volcanic ball of sand with a toxic atmosphere. Meanwhile, Ganymede is almost completely covered by water and is known for its  declining fishing industry. [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn's]] largest moon, is a barren desert world whose population has been at war since the 2060s. The Titan War II in 2068 was survived by veterans such as Vicious, Gren, Vincent, and Electra. There is a Solar System Penitentiary on [[Pluto (planet)|Pluto]], and certain [[asteroid]]s (such as Tijuana, the asteroid colony seen in the first episode) have been colonized for their minerals and other [[natural resources]].

After the advent of space travel, the [[bounty system]] of the [[Old West]] was reinstated by the government to help curb growing crime levels. Bounty hunters are encouraged to capture criminals and return them (alive and relatively unharmed) to the authorities for monetary rewards, in part through a regular television broadcast of "Big Shots", a bounty-hunter news program featuring a heavily-accented Mexican and a perky blonde with mostly-exposed breasts. These bounty hunters are now referred to as "Cowboys" in slang. In addition, ruthless crime syndicates have large influence in the [[Solar System]], indulging in such fields as [[bribery]], [[murder]], [[extortion]], [[drug dealing]], [[money laundering]] and other [[criminal offense]]s. The Woolong is the universal [[currency]], and [[paper money]] is less common since more people carry convenient money cards and rely on digital transfers.

The technology in the world of ''Cowboy Bebop'' has undergone advances to accommodate 21st century life in the [[Solar System]]. Medical advancements such as [[artificial organ]]s, [[Stem cell research|organ regrowth]] and [[cryogenics|cryogenic freezing]] have been mastered and are in full use. Home entertainment hardware called “Alfa Catch” provide a mind-machine interface for capturing or projecting images, games and movies. [[Virtual world|Virtual reality gaming]] is standard, and analog hardware such as videocassettes ([[VHS]] or [[Betamax|beta]]) can only be found as [[antiques]]. Finally, [[World Wide Web]] has evolved into a massive Solar System Web (SSW).  With these technological advancements also came a new breed of [[hacker]]s, known as "Net Divers" in slang.

Space travel is made relatively easy and casual however artificial gravity is still limited to centrifugal force. Some directed energy weapons have also been built but principally ballistic and explosive weapons are used. In addition to that many gun models present today are widely used in the series.

==Characters==
{{main|List of Cowboy Bebop characters}}
[[Image:CowboyBebopPo.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Promotional poster of ''Cowboy Bebop'', featuring the crew of the ''Bebop''.]]
The series features distinctively different main characters. The first two introduced in the series are [[Spike Spiegel]] and [[List of Cowboy Bebop characters#Jet Black|Jet Black]]. The two pilot their spaceship, the ''Bebop'', and work as bounty hunters. Spike is a former member of the Red Dragon crime syndicate who is haunted by a past love triangle between his former syndicate partner, [[List of Cowboy Bebop characters#Vicious|Vicious]], and a mysterious woman named [[List of Cowboy Bebop characters#Julia|Julia]]. Jet is a former Inter-Solar System Police (ISSP) officer and the owner of the ''Bebop''. Once called "The Black Dog" by his fellow officers for his relentless nature, he bears a [[cybernetic]] arm as constant reminder of what happened when he rushed into trouble without looking first. Like Spike, he is haunted by the memory of a woman: Alisa, his longtime girlfriend who left him without notice.

More characters are introduced and become members of the ''Bebop'' crew. The first was [[List of Cowboy Bebop characters#Ein|Ein]], a [[Welsh Corgi]] and former lab animal identified as a "data dog" by the scientists who created him.  The terminology for this title is never explained, however it is suggested that he possesses enhanced intelligence (exceeding even that of humans) as he is seen in a later episode hacking into a computer system with great ease, whereas all previous attempts by the other characters had failed.  In spite of his enhanced intelligence and comprehension, he is usually depicted as a regular dog and often spends most of his time hanging around the ship. Next was [[List of Cowboy Bebop characters#Faye Valentine|Faye Valentine]], an amnesiac, awakened from a 54-year cryogenic slumber. She is tricked into assuming the debt of the man that woke her, and constantly attempts to gamble on quick cash as a solution to her problems. Her past is a mystery, even to herself, and is unraveled progressively throughout the series. The last addition was [[List of Cowboy Bebop characters#Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky IV|Edward]], a young, eccentric computer genius and master [[hacker]]. Though she is a girl, there is a popular confusion as to Ed's gender. She gave herself the long and fanciful name "Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky IV" after being abandoned at an orphanage by her father, but it is revealed later on that her real name is Françoise Appledelhi. She goes by the name Radical Edward when hacking.

The main antagonist is [[List of Cowboy Bebop characters#Vicious|Vicious]], Spike's former syndicate partner. Though he is not featured in most of the episodes, he is mentioned and shown in flashbacks in several episodes throughout the series. Other antagonists include a variety of bounty-heads that the crew hunt to collect funding.

===Japan===
''Cowboy Bebop'' almost didn't appear on [[Japan]]ese broadcast television due to its depictions of violence. It was first sent to [[TV Tokyo]], one of the main broadcasters of anime in Japan. The show had an aborted first run from April 3, 1998 until June 19, 1998 on TV Tokyo, broadcasting only [[List of Cowboy Bebop episodes#Session 2.2C Stray Dog Strut|episodes 2]], [[List of Cowboy Bebop episodes#Session 3.2C Honky Tonk Women|3]], [[List of Cowboy Bebop episodes#Session 7.2C Heavy Metal Queen|7]] to [[List of Cowboy Bebop episodes#Session 15.2C My Funny Valentine|15]] and [[List of Cowboy Bebop episodes#Session 18.2C Speak Like a Child|18]].

Later that year, the series was shown in its entirety from October 23 until April 23, 1999, on the satellite network [[WOWOW]].<ref name="About-Bebop">[http://www.cowboybebop.org/english/session/first/index.html]</ref> With the Tv Tokyo broadcast slot fiasco, the production schedule was disrupted to the extent that the last episode was delivered to WOWOW on the day of its broadcast. Cowboy Bebop won the [[Seiun Award#Best Media of the Year|Seiun Award]] in 2000. 

The full series has also been broadcast across Japan by the anime television network, [[Animax]], who has also aired the series via its respective networks across Southeast Asia, South Asia and East Asia. ''Cowboy Bebop'' was popular enough that the movie, ''[[Cowboy Bebop: The Movie|Cowboy Bebop: Tengoku no Tobira]]'' (''Knockin' on Heaven's Door''), was commissioned and released in Japan in 2001, and later released in the United States as ''Cowboy Bebop: The Movie'' in 2003.

==Soundtrack==

One of the most notable elements of ''Cowboy Bebop'' is its music. Performed by [[Yoko Kanno]] and [[The Seatbelts]], a band Kanno assembled to perform music for the series, the jazz and blues themed soundtrack helps to define the show as much as the characters, writing, and even animation. Many fans find the soundtracks enjoyable to listen to as albums on their own, independent of the series. ''Cowboy Bebop'' was voted by [[IGN]] in 2006 as having the greatest soundtrack for an [[anime]].<ref>[http://music.ign.com/articles/708/708910p1.html IGN: Top Ten Anime Themes and Soundtracks of All-Time], IGN.</ref>
