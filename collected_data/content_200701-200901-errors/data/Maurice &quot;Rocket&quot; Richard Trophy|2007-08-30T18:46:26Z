==History==
[[Image:Maurice richard profile.jpg|left|150px|thumb|[[Maurice Richard]], the namesake for the trophy.]]
The Maurice 'Rocket' Richard Trophy is the newest of the NHL's trophies and was donated by the [[Montreal Canadiens]] in 1999 and was first awarded at the end of the [[1998-99 NHL season]]. The trophy is named in honour of the legendary [[Montreal Canadiens]] [[Winger (ice hockey)|right winger]] [[Maurice Richard|Maurice "Rocket" Richard]], who spent his entire eighteen season career with the Canadiens and led the NHL in goal scoring five times during his career and in [[1944-45 NHL season|1944-45]] he became the first player in NHL history to score [[50 goals in 50 games|50 goals]] in one season.<ref name="Richard history2">{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/html/silver_splashrocketrichard.htm|title=Maurice "Rocket" Richard Trophy history|accessdate=2007-07-31|publisher=Legendsofhockey.net}}</ref>

[[Pavel Bure]], the first winner of the trophy, and [[Jarome Iginla]] are the only players to have won the trophy twice. The [[2003-04 NHL season|2003-04 season]] featured a three-way tie between Iginla, [[Ilya Kovalchuk]] and [[Rick Nash]], the only tie in the short history of the trophy. 

Although the winner of the [[Art Ross Trophy|NHL's leading points scorer]] often wins the [[Hart Memorial Trophy]] as league MVP, no winner of the Maurice 'Rocket' Richard Trophy has also won the Hart Trophy for the same season.<ref name="Hart history">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/trophies/hart.html|title=Hart Memorial Trophy history|accessdate=2007-08-22|publisher=NHL.com}}</ref>
