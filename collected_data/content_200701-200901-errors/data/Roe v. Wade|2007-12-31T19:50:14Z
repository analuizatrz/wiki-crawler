'''''Roe v. Wade''''', [[Case citation|410 U.S. 113]] (1973) was a [[United States]] [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case that resulted in a [[landmark decision]] regarding [[abortion]].<ref name="Roe">''Roe v.

Retrieved [[2007-01-26]]</ref>  According to the  ''Roe'' decision, most laws against [[abortion in the United States]] violated a [[United States Constitution|constitutional right]] to [[privacy]] under the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].  The decision overturned all [[state law|state]] and [[federal law|federal]] laws outlawing or restricting abortion that were inconsistent with its [[holding]]s. ''Roe v. Wade'' is one of the most controversial and politically significant cases in U.S. Supreme Court history. Its lesser-known companion case, ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'', was decided at the same time.<ref name="Doe">''Doe v. Bolton'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=410&invol=179 410 U.S. 179] (1973). Findlaw.com.

The central holding of ''Roe v. Wade'' was that abortions are permissible for any reason a woman chooses, up until the "point at which the [[fetus]] becomes ‘viable,’ that is, potentially able to live outside the mother's [[uterus|womb]], albeit with artificial aid. [[Fetus#Viability|Viability]] is usually placed at about seven months (28 weeks) but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks."<ref name="Roe"/>  The Court also held that abortion after viability must be available when needed to protect a woman's health, [[Doe v. Bolton#Broad definition of health|which the Court defined broadly]] in the companion case of ''Doe v. Bolton''.  These court rulings affected laws in 46 states.<ref>William Mears and Bob Franken, [http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/01/21/roevwade.overview/ “30 years after ruling, ambiguity, anxiety surround abortion debate”], CNN ([[2003-01-22]]): “In all, the Roe and Doe rulings impacted laws in 46 states.”</ref> 

The ''Roe v. Wade'' decision prompted national debate that continues to this day. Debated subjects include whether and to what extent abortion should be illegal, who should decide whether or not abortion is illegal, what methods the Supreme Court should use in constitutional [[adjudication]], and what the role should be of [[religion|religious]] and [[morality|moral]] views in the political sphere. ''Roe v. Wade'' reshaped national politics, dividing much of the nation into pro-''Roe'' (mostly [[pro-choice]]) and anti-''Roe'' (mostly [[pro-life]]) camps, and inspiring [[grassroots]] activism on both sides.

==History of case==

In 1970, attorneys [[Linda Coffee]] and [[Sarah Weddington]] filed suit in a U.S. District Court in [[Texas]] on behalf of [[Norma McCorvey|Norma L. McCorvey]] ("Jane Roe").  McCorvey claimed her pregnancy was the result of [[rape]], although she now says her claim was false.<ref name="testimony"/>  The defendant in the case was [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas County]] District Attorney [[Henry Wade]], representing the State of Texas.

The district court ruled in McCorvey's favor, but refused to grant an [[injunction]] against the enforcement of the laws barring abortion.<ref>''Roe v. Wade'',  314 F.

==Supreme Court decision==	
[[Image:Blackmun.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Harry Blackmun]] wrote the Court’s opinion.]]  The court issued its decision on [[January 22]], [[1973]], with a 7 to 2 majority voting to strike down Texas abortion laws.  Burger and Douglas' concurring opinion and White's dissenting opinion were issued separately, in the companion case of ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]''.

The ''Roe'' Court deemed abortion a [[fundamental right]] under the [[United States Constitution]], thereby subjecting all laws attempting to restrict it to the standard of [[strict scrutiny]]. Although abortion is still considered a fundamental right, subsequent cases, notably ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey|Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey]]'', ''[[Stenberg v. Carhart]]'', and ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]'' have affected the legal standard.

The opinion of the ''Roe'' Court, written by Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], declined to adopt the district court's [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]] rationale, and instead asserted that the "[[right of privacy]], whether it be founded in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]'s concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or, as the District Court determined, in the Ninth Amendment's reservation of rights to the people, is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy."  Douglas, in his concurring opinion from the companion case ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'', stated more emphatically that, "The Ninth Amendment obviously does not create federally enforceable rights."  Thus, the ''Roe'' majority rested its opinion squarely on the Constitution's [[due process clause]].

According to the ''Roe'' Court, "the restrictive criminal abortion laws in effect in a majority of States today are of relatively recent vintage." [[Abortion in the United States#Abortion before Roe|Abortion before ''Roe'']] had been subject to criminal statutes since at least the nineteenth century.  Section VI of Blackmun's opinion was devoted to an analysis of historical attitudes, including those of the [[Persia|Persian Empire]], [[Ancient Greece|Greek times]], the [[Roman era]], the [[Hippocratic oath]], the [[common law]], English [[statutory law]], American law, the [[American Medical Association]], the [[American Public Health Association]], and the [[American Bar Association]].

Without finding what it deemed a sufficient historical basis to justify the Texas statute, the Court identified three possible justifications in Section VII of the opinion to explain the criminalization of abortion: (1) women who can receive an abortion are more likely to engage in "illicit sexual conduct"; (2) the medical procedure was extremely risky prior to the development of [[antibiotic]]s and, even with modern medical techniques, is still risky in late stages of pregnancy; and (3) the state has an interest in protecting prenatal life. To the first, Blackmun wrote that "no court or commentator has taken the argument seriously" and the statute failed to "distinguish between married and unwed mothers"; according to the Court, the second and third constitute valid state interests. In Section X, the Court reiterated, "[T]he State does have an important and legitimate interest in preserving and protecting the health of the pregnant woman ... and that it has still another important and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life."

Although the Constitution does not explicitly mention any right of privacy, the Court had previously found support for various privacy rights in several provisions of the [[Bill of Rights]] and the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], as well as in the "[[penumbra]]" of the Bill of Rights. But instead of relying upon the Bill of Rights or "penumbras, formed by emanations", as the Court had done in ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'', the ''Roe'' Court relied on a "right of privacy" that it said was located in the due process clause of the Constitution.

The Court determined that "arguments that Texas either has no valid interest at all in regulating the abortion decision, or no interest strong enough to support any limitation upon the woman's sole determination, are unpersuasive", and declared, "We, therefore, conclude that the right of personal privacy includes the abortion decision, but that this right is not unqualified and must be considered against important state interests in regulation." 

When weighing the competing interests that the Court had identified, Blackmun also asserted that if the [[fetus]] was defined as a person for purposes of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] then the fetus would have a specific [[right to life]] under that Amendment.  However, the Court majority determined that the [[original intent]] of the Constitution (up to the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868) did not include the unborn.  

The Court's determination of whether a fetus can enjoy constitutional protection was separate from the notion of when life begins: "We need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins. When those trained in the respective disciplines of [[medicine]], [[philosophy]], and [[theology]] are unable to arrive at any consensus, the [[judiciary]], at this point in the development of man's knowledge, is not in a position to speculate as to the answer."  The Court only believed itself positioned to resolve the question of when a right to abortion begins.

The decision established a system of [[trimester]]s that attempted to balance the state's legitimate interests against the abortion right.  The Court ruled that the state cannot restrict a woman's right to an abortion during the first trimester, the state can regulate the abortion procedure during the second trimester "in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health", and the state can choose to restrict or [[proscription|proscribe]] abortion as it sees fit during the third trimester when the fetus is viable ("except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother").

===Justiciability===
An aspect of the decision that attracted comparatively little attention was the Court's disposition of the issues of [[Standing (law)|standing]] and [[mootness]]. The Supreme Court does not issue [[advisory opinion]]s (those stating what the law would be in some hypothetical circumstance). Instead, there must be an actual "[[case or controversy]]", including particularly a plaintiff who is aggrieved and seeks relief. In the ''Roe'' case, "Jane Roe", who began the litigation in March 1970, had already given birth by the time the case was argued before the Supreme Court in December 1971. By the traditional rules, therefore, there was an argument that Roe's appeal was moot because she would not be affected by the ruling, and also because she lacked standing to assert the rights of other pregnant women.<ref>Abernathy, M. et al., ''[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0872498549&id=tHhlYpWokFIC&pg=RA1-PA4&lpg=RA1-PA4&ots=OeQSTLp91C&dq=standing+and+mootness+and+%22roe+v.+wade%22&num=100&sig=gfDTMq-LyUVI-lg8tNreUQFjX6c Civil Liberties Under the Constitution]'' (U. South Carolina 1993), page 4.  Retrieved [[2007-02-04]].</ref>

The Court concluded that the case came within an established exception to the rule; one that allowed consideration of an issue that was "capable of repetition, yet evading [[judicial review|review]]." This phrase had been coined in 1911 by Justice [[Joseph McKenna]].<ref>''Southern Pacific v. Interstate Commerce Commission'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=219&invol=498 219 U.S. 498] (1911).  Findlaw.com.  Retrieved [[2007-01-26]]</ref> Blackmun's opinion quoted McKenna, and noted that pregnancy would normally conclude more quickly than an appellate process: "If that termination makes a case moot, pregnancy litigation seldom will survive much beyond the trial stage, and appellate review will be effectively denied." This ruling was critical to the Supreme Court's power to review the case.

== Dissents ==
[[Image:Justice White Official.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Byron White]] was the senior dissenting justice.]]
Associate Justices [[Byron R. White]] and [[William H. Rehnquist]] wrote emphatic dissenting opinions in this case.  Justice White wrote:

{{cquote|I find nothing in the language or history of the Constitution to support the Court's judgment.  The Court simply fashions and announces a new constitutional right for pregnant mothers and, with scarcely any reason or authority for its action, invests that right with sufficient substance to override most existing state abortion statutes. The upshot is that the people and the legislatures of the 50 States are constitutionally disentitled to weigh the relative importance of the continued existence and development of the fetus, on the one hand, against a spectrum of possible impacts on the mother, on the other hand. As an exercise of raw judicial power, the Court perhaps has authority to do what it does today; but, in my view, its judgment is an improvident and extravagant exercise of the power of judicial review that the Constitution extends to this Court.<ref name="Doe"/>}}

White asserted that the Court "values the convenience of the pregnant mother more than the continued existence and development of the life or potential life that she carries." Despite White suggesting he "might agree" with the Court's values and priorities, he wrote that he saw "no constitutional warrant for imposing such an order of priorities on the people and legislatures of the States."  White criticized the Court for involving itself in this issue by creating "a constitutional barrier to state efforts to protect human life and by investing mothers and doctors with the constitutionally protected right to exterminate it."  He would have left this issue, for the most part, "with the people and to the political processes the people have devised to govern their affairs."

Rehnquist elaborated upon several of White's points, by asserting that the Court's historical analysis was flawed:

{{cquote|To reach its result, the Court necessarily has had to find within the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment a right that was apparently completely unknown to the drafters of the Amendment.  As early as 1821, the first state law dealing directly with abortion was enacted by the Connecticut Legislature.  By the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, there were at least 36 laws enacted by state or territorial legislatures limiting abortion. While many States have amended or updated their laws, 21 of the laws on the books in 1868 remain in effect today.<ref name="Roe"/>}} 

From this historical record, Rehnquist concluded that, "There apparently was no question concerning the validity of this provision or of any of the other state statutes when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted." Therefore, in his view, "the drafters did not intend to have the Fourteenth Amendment withdraw from the States the power to legislate with respect to this matter."

==Controversy==
A criticism of Roe v. Wade (though not one made by the dissenting Justices in the case) is that the majority opinion failed to adequately recognize the [[inviolability]] and [[person|personhood]] of embryonic/fetal human life. Some pro-life supporters argue that life begins at conception, and thus the unborn should be entitled to legal protection. Other pro-life supporters argue that, in the absence of definite knowledge of when life begins, it is best to avoid the risk of doing harm.<ref>Reagan, Ronald.

Opponents of ''Roe'' have objected that the decision lacks a valid Constitutional foundation.  Like the dissenters in ''Roe'', they have maintained that the Constitution is silent on the issue, and that proper solutions to the question would best be found via state legislatures and the [[democracy|democratic]] process, rather than through an all-encompassing ruling from the Supreme Court. Supporters of ''Roe'' contend that the decision has a valid constitutional foundation, or contend that justification for the result in ''Roe'' could be found in the Constitution but not in the articles referenced in the decision.<ref>''[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0814799183&id=Us-277i9ZJYC&pg=PP1&lpg=PP1&ots=P3h5hDqS1u&dq=%22what+roe+v.+wade+should+have+said%22&num=100&sig=gJ9jX7_d2MOXAkvWRgkwiDYImPs What Roe v.

In response to ''Roe v. Wade'', most states enacted or attempted to enact laws limiting or regulating abortion, such as laws requiring [[parental consent]] for minors to obtain abortions, parental notification laws, spousal mutual consent laws, [[spousal notification]] laws, laws requiring abortions to be performed in hospitals but not clinics, laws barring state funding for abortions, laws banning abortions utilizing [[intact dilation and extraction]] procedures (often referred to as partial-birth abortion), laws requiring waiting periods before abortion, or laws mandating women read certain types of literature before choosing an abortion.<ref>Guttmacher Institute, "[http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_OAL.pdf State Policies in Brief, An Overview of Abortion Laws (PDF)]", published [[2007-01-01]].

McRae]]'' (1980).<ref>''Harris v. McRae'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=448&invol=297 448 U.S. 297] (1980).  Findlaw.com.  Retrieved [[2007-01-26]].</ref>

The most prominent organized groups that mobilized in response to ''Roe'' are the [[NARAL Pro-Choice America|National Abortion Rights Action League]] on the pro-choice side, and the [[National Right to Life Committee]] on the pro-life side.  During his life, Harry Blackmun, author of the ''Roe'' opinion, was a determined advocate for the decision.  Others have joined him in support of ''Roe'', including [[Judith Jarvis Thomson]], who before the decision had offered an influential defense of abortion.<ref>Thomson, Judith. "[[A Defense of Abortion]]," in ''Philosophy and Public Affairs'', vol. 1, no. 1 (1971), pp. 47–66.</ref> 

''Roe'' remains controversial;  [[Abortion in the United States#Public opinion|polls]] show continued division about its landmark rulings, and about the decision as a whole.

===Internal memoranda===
Internal Supreme Court memoranda surfaced in the [[Library of Congress]] in 1988, among the personal papers of Douglas and other Justices, showing the private discussions of the Justices on the case. Blackmun said of the majority decision he authored, "You will observe that I have concluded that the end of the first trimester is critical. This is arbitrary, but perhaps any other selected point, such as quickening or viability, is equally arbitrary."<ref>Woodward, Bob.

A12 ([[2000-01-22]]). "Roe v. Wade was wrong because it 'usurped the power of the legislatures,' Bush said. 'I felt like it was a case where the court took the place of what legislatures should do in America,' he said. But Bush refused to say how he felt each state should act. Instead, he said that when it comes to legalizing abortion, 'it should be up to each legislature.'"

Scalia's dissent acknowledged that abortion rights are of "great importance to many women", but asserted that it is not a liberty protected by the Constitution, because the Constitution does not mention it, and because longstanding traditions have permitted it to be legally proscribed.  Scalia concluded: "by foreclosing all democratic outlet for the deep passions this issue arouses, by banishing the issue from the political forum that gives all participants, even the losers, the satisfaction of a fair hearing and an honest fight, by continuing the imposition of a rigid national rule instead of allowing for regional differences, the Court merely prolongs and intensifies the anguish."<ref name="Casey"/>

===''Stenberg v. Carhart''===
During the 1990s, [[Nebraska]] attempted to ban certain second-trimester abortion procedures sometimes called [[Intact dilation and extraction|partial birth abortions]].  The Nebraska ban allowed other second-trimester abortion procedures called [[dilation and evacuation]] abortions.  Ginsburg (who replaced White) stated, "this law does not save any fetus from destruction, for it targets only 'a method of performing abortion'."<ref name="Stenberg">''Stenberg v. Carhart'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&court=US&vol=530&page=914 530 U.S. 914] (2000).  Retrieved [[2007-02-02]].</ref>  The Supreme Court struck down the Nebraska ban by a 5-4 vote in ''[[Stenberg v. Carhart]]'' (2000), citing a right to use the safest method of abortion.  

Kennedy, who had co-authored the 5-4 ''Casey'' decision upholding ''Roe'', was among the dissenters in ''Stenberg'', writing that Nebraska had done nothing unconstitutional.<ref name="Stenberg"/>  Kennedy described the second trimester abortion procedure that Nebraska was ''not'' seeking to prohibit: "The fetus, in many cases, dies just as a human adult or child would: It bleeds to death as it is torn from limb from limb. The fetus can be alive at the beginning of the dismemberment process and can survive for a time while its limbs are being torn off."  Kennedy wrote that since this dilation and evacuation procedure remained available in Nebraska, the state was free to ban the other procedure known as partial birth abortion.<ref name="Stenberg"/>

The remaining three dissenters in ''Stenberg'' &mdash; Thomas, Scalia, and Rehnquist &mdash; disagreed again with ''Roe'': "Although a State may permit abortion, nothing in the Constitution dictates that a State must do so."

===''Gonzales v. Carhart''===
In 2003, Congress passed the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]], which led to a lawsuit in the case of ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]''.  The Court had previously ruled in ''[[Stenberg v. Carhart]]'' that a state's ban on partial birth abortion was unconstitutional because such a ban would not allow for the health of the mother.  The membership of the Court changed after ''Stenberg'', with [[John Roberts]] and [[Samuel Alito]] replacing Rehnquist and O'Connor, respectively.  Further, the ban at issue in ''Gonzales v. Carhart'' was a federal statute, rather than a relatively vague state statute as in the ''Stenberg'' case.  

On [[April 18]], [[2007]], the Supreme Court handed down a 5 to 4 decision upholding the constitutionality of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. Kennedy wrote for the five-justice majority that Congress was within its power to generally ban the procedure, although the Court left the door open for as-applied challenges.  Kennedy's opinion did not reach the question whether the Court's prior decisions in ''Roe v. Wade'', ''Planned Parenthood v. Casey'', and ''Stenberg v. Carhart'' were valid, and instead the Court said that the challenged statute is consistent with those prior decisions whether or not those prior decisions were valid.

Joining the majority were Chief Justice [[John Roberts]], Scalia, Thomas, and Alito. Ginsburg and the other three justices dissented, contending that the ruling ignored Supreme Court abortion precedent, and also offering an equality-based justification for that abortion precedent. Thomas filed a concurring opinion, joined by Scalia, contending that the Court's prior decisions in ''Roe v. Wade'' and ''Planned Parenthood v. Casey'' should be reversed, and also noting that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act may exceed the powers of Congress under the [[Commerce Clause]].

On [[February 22]], [[2005]], the Supreme Court refused to grant a [[certiorari|writ of certiorari]], and McCorvey's appeal ended.
