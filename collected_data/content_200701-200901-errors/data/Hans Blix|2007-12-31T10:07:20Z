{{Audio|sv-Hans_Blix.ogg|'''Hans Martin Blix'''}} (born [[28 June]], [[1928]] in [[Uppsala]], [[Sweden]]) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[diplomat]] and [[politician]]. He was [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Sweden)|Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs]] (1978 - 1979). Blix was also the head of the [[United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission]] from January 2000 to June 2003, when he was succeeded by [[Demetrius Perricos]]. In 2002, the commission began searching [[Iraq]] for [[weapons of mass destruction]], ultimately finding none. 
He is the son of professor Gunnar Blix and Hertha Wiberg and comes from a family of [[Jämtland|Jamtlandic]] origin.

== Early career ==
Blix studied at [[Uppsala University]] and [[Columbia University]], earning his Ph.D. from the [[University of Cambridge]] ([[Trinity Hall, Cambridge|Trinity Hall]]).<ref>2002 Friedmann Award Given to Dr. Hans Blix  http://www.law.columbia.edu/media_inquiries/news_events/2002/friedmann_2002 Retrieved 3/21/07</ref> In 1959, he graduated in [[International Law]] at the [[University of Stockholm]], where he was appointed Associate Professor in International Law the next year.  <ref>http://www.wmdcommission.org/sida.asp?ID=33 Retrieved 3/21/07</ref>

Between 1962 and 1978 Blix was a member of the Swedish delegation at the Disarmament Conference in Geneva. He held several other positions in the Swedish administration between 1963 and 1976, and from 1961 to 1981 served on the Swedish delegation to the United Nations. From 1978 to 1979, Blix was the Swedish Foreign Minister.

Blix chaired the Swedish [[Liberal People's Party (Sweden)|Liberal Party]]'s campaign during the 1980 [[Referenda in Sweden|Referendum]] on [[nuclear power]], campaigning in favor of retention of the Swedish nuclear energy program.

== Head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (1981-1997) ==
Blix was the head of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] between 1981 and 1997. He personally made repeated inspection visits to the Iraqi nuclear reactor ''[[Osiraq]]'' before its attempted destruction by the [[Iran]]ians, in 1980, and its eventual destruction by the [[Israeli Air Force]] in 1981 during [[Operation Opera]]. Although most agreed that Iraq was years away from being able to build a [[nuclear weapon]], the Iranians and the Israelis felt any raid must occur well before nuclear fuel was loaded to prevent [[nuclear fallout]]. The attack was regarded as being in breach of the [[United Nations Charter]] (S/RES/487) and international law and was widely condemned. 

Blix and the [[IAEA]] never discovered the clandestine nuclear program that was "initiated" by Iraq in the [[1970s]] [http://www.iaea.org/worldatom/Programmes/ActionTeam/faqs.html] on the site where Osiraq was harbored. In 1982, the [[Reagan Administration]] removed Iraq from the State Department's list of countries that allegedly supported [[terrorism]]. 

The collaboration with [[Saddam Hussein|Saddam]] during and after the [[Iran-Iraq War]] by several [[developed country|industrialised countries]] has led many to believe that there was no strong political will to fully utilise the IAEA [http://counterpunch.org/dixon06172004.html].

Iraq was alternately praised and admonished by the IAEA for its cooperation and lack thereof. It was only after the first [[Gulf War]] that the full extent of Iraq's nuclear programs, which had switched from a [[plutonium]] based weapon design to a highly [[enriched uranium]] design after the destruction of Osiraq, became known.

== Iraq disarmament crisis (2002-2003) ==
During the [[Iraq disarmament crisis]] before the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], Blix was called back from retirement by UN Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]] to lead [[United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission]] in charge of monitoring Iraq.  Kofi Annan originally recommended [[Rolf Ekéus]], who worked with UNSCOM in the past, but both Russia and France vetoed his appointment. <!--"Called back from retirement" is mentionened in "Disarming Iraq"; should check for more details -->
<!-- Much has to be written about the work done in Iraq. "Disarming Iraq" is a good reference -->
Hans Blix personally admonished Saddam for "cat and mouse" games [http://www.news.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/11/16/wirq16.xml] and warned Iraq of "serious consequences" if it attempted to hinder or delay his mission 
[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2485209.stm]. 

In his report to the UN Security Council on [[February 14]], [[2003]], Blix claimed that "If Iraq had provided the necessary cooperation in 1991, the phase of disarmament -- under resolution 687 -- could have been short and a decade of sanctions could have been avoided." [http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,,895882,00.html]

Blix's statements about the [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|Iraq WMD program]] came to contradict the claims of the [[George W. Bush|Bush administration]], [https://www.cia.gov/cia/reports/iraq_wmd/Iraq_Oct_2002.htm] and attracted a great deal of criticism from supporters of the invasion of Iraq. In an interview on [[BBC 1|BBC TV]] on [[8 February]], [[2004]], Dr. Blix accused the [[United States|U.S.]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] [[government]]s of dramatising the threat of [[weapons of mass destruction]] in [[Iraq]], in order to strengthen the case for the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 war]] against the regime of [[Saddam Hussein]].

[[Newt Gingrich]] stated that approving Hans Blix as chief U.N. weapons inspector was one of the biggest mistakes the United States ever made. 

The motivation behind the Russian and French veto which ruled out [[Rolf Ekéus]] must also bear scrutiny. Russia in particular has profited hugely from the increase in energy prices following the Iraq conflict and continuing tensions with Iran.
Blix had little credibility in Washington due to his inspection teams failures and Iraqi obfuscation during the mid to late 1990s which culminated in the limited airstrikes of [[Operation Desert Fox]] in late 1998. These attacks effectively destroyed the broad 1991 Gulf War coalition that had liberated Kuwait.

In an interview with London's ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' newspaper, Hans Blix said, "I have my detractors in Washington. There are bastards who spread things around, of course, who planted nasty things in the media" [http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/06/12/blix.interview.cnna/].

In 2004, Blix published a book, ''Disarming Iraq'', where he gives his account of the events and inspections before the coalition began its invasion.

Ultimately, no stockpiles of [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]] were found.

===Bugged===

'''Hans Blix''' said he suspected his home and office were bugged by the [[United States]], while he led teams searching for Saddam Hussein's supposed weapons of mass destruction.<ref name='bug'>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Blix suspected U.S. spied on him | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/02/28/un.britain/index.html | work =[[cnn]] | pages = | accessdate = 2007-09-20 | language = }}</ref>

== Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission ==
{{Expand|date=July 2007}}
Since 2003 Blix has been chair of the [[Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission]] (WMDC), an independent body funded by the Swedish government and based in Stockholm [http://www.wmdcommission.org/].

In December 2006, the Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission said in a report that Pakistan’s infamous and controversial nuclear proliferator [[Abdul Qadeer Khan]] could not have acted alone, ''“without the awareness of the Pakistani government”''.<ref> "A Q Khan did not act alone" says Hans Blix team[http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/dec82006/foreign2156302006127.asp]</ref>
