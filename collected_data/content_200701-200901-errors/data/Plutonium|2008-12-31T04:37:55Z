'''Plutonium''' ({{pronEng|pluːˈtoʊniəm}}, symbol '''Pu''', [[atomic number]] 94) is a rare [[transuranic]] [[radioactive]] [[chemical element|element]]. It is an [[actinide]] [[metal]] of silvery-white appearance that tarnishes when exposed to air, forming a dull coating when [[plutonium(IV) oxide|oxidized]]. The element normally exhibits six [[allotrope]]s and four [[oxidation state]]s. It reacts with [[carbon]], [[halogen]]s, [[nitrogen]] and [[silicon]]. When exposed to moist air, it expands up to 70% in volume and forms a powder that can [[pyrophoricity|spontaneously ignite]]. It is also a [[Radiation poisoning|radiological poison]] that accumulates in [[bone marrow]]. These and other properties make the handling of plutonium dangerous and have led to a number of [[criticality accident]]s.

The most important [[isotope]] of plutonium is [[plutonium-239]], with a [[half-life]] of 24,100&nbsp;years. Plutonium-239 is [[fissile]], meaning it can break apart ([[nuclear fission|fission]]) by being bombarded by slow-moving [[neutron]]s; releasing energy, [[gamma radiation]] and [[neutron radiation|more neutrons]]. It can therefore sustain a [[nuclear chain reaction]] after reaching a [[critical mass]], making it useful in many [[nuclear weapon]]s and in some [[nuclear reactor]]s. The most stable [[isotopes of plutonium|isotope of plutonium]] is [[plutonium-244]], with a half-life of about 80&nbsp;million years; long enough to be found in trace quantities in nature. [[Plutonium-238]] has a half-life of 88&nbsp;years and emits [[alpha particle]]s. It is a heat source in [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s, which are used to power some [[spacecraft]]. [[Plutonium-240]] emits neutrons randomly, limiting a sample's weapon and power potential and determining its grade: weapons (<7%), fuel (7–19%) and reactor grade (>19%). Plutonium-238 and plutonium-239 are synthesized by bombarding [[uranium-238]] with neutrons and [[deuteron]]s, respectively.

Element 94 was first synthesized in 1940 by a team led by [[Glenn T. Seaborg]] and [[Edwin McMillan]] at a [[University of California, Berkeley]] laboratory. McMillan named the new element after [[Pluto]] and Seaborg suggested the symbol Pu as a joke. Discovery of plutonium became a classified part of the [[Manhattan Project]] to develop an atomic bomb during [[World War II]]. The first [[nuclear test]], "[[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity]]" (July 1945), and the second atomic bomb used to destroy a city ([[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Nagasaki, Japan in August 1945]]), "[[Fat Man]]", both had cores of plutonium-239. [[Human radiation experiments]] studying plutonium were conducted without [[informed consent]] during and after the war. Disposal of [[nuclear waste|plutonium waste]] from [[nuclear power plant]]s and [[nuclear disarmament|dismantled nuclear weapons]] built during the [[Cold War]] is a major [[nuclear proliferation]], health and environmental concern. Other sources of [[plutonium in the environment]] are from the [[nuclear fallout|fallout]] from numerous above-ground nuclear tests (now [[Partial Test Ban Treaty|banned]]) and from several [[nuclear accident]]s.

[[Resistivity]] is a measure of how strongly a material opposes the flow of [[electric current]]. The resistivity of plutonium at room temperature is very high for a metal and it gets even higher with lower temperatures, which is unusual for metals.<ref name = "Miner1968p544"/> This trend continues down to 100&nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]], below which resistivity rapidly decreases for fresh samples.<ref name = "Miner1968p544"/> Resistivity then begins to increase with time at around 20&nbsp;K due to radiation damage, with the rate dictated by the isotopic composition of the sample.<ref name = "Miner1968p544"/>

Due to self-irradiation, a sample of plutonium fatigues throughout its crystal structure, meaning the ordered arrangement of its atoms becomes disrupted by radiation with time.<ref name = "HeckerPlutonium" /> However, self-irradiation can also lead to [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] which counteracts some of the fatigue effects as temperature increases above 100&nbsp;K.<ref>

The presence of these many allotropes makes machining plutonium very difficult, as it changes state very readily. For example, the α phase exists at room temperature in unalloyed plutonium. It has machining characteristics similar to [[cast iron]] but changes to the plastic and easy to work β phase (''beta phase'') at slightly higher temperatures.<ref name = "Miner1968p542"/> The reasons for the complicated phase diagram are not entirely understood; recent research has focused on constructing accurate computer models of the phase transitions.{{inote|Ambient pressure phase diagram of plutonium}} The α phase has a low-symmetry [[monoclinic crystal system|monoclinic]] structure, hence its brittleness, strength, compressibility and poor conductivity.<ref name = "Baker1983"/>

Plutonium in the δ phase (''delta phase'') normally exists in the 310&nbsp;°C to 452&nbsp;°C range but is stable at room temperature when alloyed with a small percentage of [[gallium]], [[aluminium]], or [[cerium]], enhancing workability and allowing it to be [[welding|welded]].<ref name = "Miner1968p542"/> The delta phase has more typical metallic character, and is roughly as strong and malleable as aluminium.<ref name = "Baker1983"/><!-- NEEDS CITE In fission weapons, the explosive [[shock wave]]s used to compress a plutonium core will also cause a transition from the usual delta phase plutonium to the denser alpha phase, significantly helping to achieve [[supercriticality]]. /NEEDS CITE -->

The isotope Pu-239 can undergo nuclear fission if its nucleus is struck by a [[neutron temperature|thermal neutron]].<ref name = "Stwertka1998"/> The fission of Pu-239 itself releases neutrons that bombard other Pu-239 atoms, which fission and release more neutrons and so on in a [[nuclear chain reaction]].

During fission, a fraction of the [[binding energy]], which holds a nucleus together, is released as a large amount of thermal, electromagnetic and kinetic energy; a kilogram of Pu-239 can produce an explosion equivalent to 20,000&nbsp;tons of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]].<ref name = "Heiserman1992"/> It is this energy that makes Pu-239 useful in [[nuclear weapon]]s and [[nuclear reactor|reactors]].

The presence of the isotope Pu-240 in a material limits its nuclear bomb potential since it emits neutrons randomly, increasing the difficulty of accurately initiating a chain reaction at the desired instant and thus reducing the bomb's reliability and power.<ref>

The isotopes of plutonium range in [[mass number]] from 228 to 247.<ref name = "NNDC"/> The primary [[decay mode]]s before the most stable isotope, Pu-244, are [[spontaneous fission]] and [[alpha emission|α emission]]; the primary mode after is [[beta emission|β emission]].<ref name = "NNDC"/> The primary [[decay product]]s before Pu-244 are uranium and [[neptunium]]  isotopes (neglecting the wide range of daughter nuclei created by fission processes), and the primary products after are [[americium]] isotopes.<ref name = "NNDC"/> Pu-241 is the [[parent isotope]] of the [[neptunium decay series]], decaying to americium-241 via β or electron emission.<ref name = "Heiserman1992"/>{{inote|page 340}}

Pu-238 and Pu-239 are the most-widely synthesized isotopes.<ref name = "Heiserman1992"/> Pu-239 is synthesized via the following reaction using uranium (U) and neutrons (n) via beta decay (β<sup>−</sup>) with neptunium (Np) as an intermediate:<ref name = "Greenwood1997p1259">{{harvnb|Greenwood|1997|p = 1259}}</ref>

In other words, neutrons from the fission of U-235 are [[neutron capture|captured]] by U-238 nuclei to form U-239; a [[beta decay]] adds a proton to form Np-239 (half-life 2.3&nbsp;days) and another beta decay forms Pu-239, which has a half-life of 24,000&nbsp;years.<ref name = "Emsley2001"/> Pu-238 is synthesized by bombarding U-238 with [[deuteron]]s (d, the nuclei of heavy [[hydrogen]]) in the following reaction:<ref name = "Heiserman1992"/>{{inote|page 339}}
:<sup>238</sup>U(d,2n)<sup>238</sup>Np → <sup>238</sup>Pu + β<sup>−</sup>
In this equation, a deuteron hitting U-238 produces two neutrons and Np-238. The Np-238 spontaneously decays by emitting negative beta particles to form Pu-238.

This can result in an explosion large enough to destroy a city if enough of the isotope is concentrated to form a critical mass.<ref name = "Emsley2001"/>

During [[World War II]] the U.S. government set up the [[Manhattan Project]], which was tasked with developing an atomic bomb. The three primary research and production sites of the project were the plutonium production facility at what is now the [[Hanford Site]], the [[uranium enrichment]] facilities at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], and the weapons research and design laboratory, now known as [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]].<ref>

Six kilograms of plutonium were detonated in the first atomic bomb test, codenamed [[Trinity test|"Trinity"]], on July 16, 1945 near [[Alamogordo, New Mexico]].<ref name = "Miner1968p541"/> Conventional explosives were used in the Trinity device, named "The Gadget," to squeeze pieces of plutonium into a critical mass that was immediately showered with neutrons from an initiator made of [[beryllium]] and [[polonium]].<ref name = "Emsley2001"/> Together, these ensured a runaway chain reaction and explosion.

Plutonium was also used in the "[[Fat Man]]" atomic bomb dropped on [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki, Japan]] on August 9, 1945.

The isotope Pu-239 is a key fissile component in [[nuclear weapon]]s, due to its ease of fission and availability. Encasing the bomb's sphere of plutonium in a [[Nuclear weapon design|tamper]] (an optional layer of dense material) decreases the amount of plutonium needed to reach [[critical mass (nuclear)|critical mass]] by [[neutron reflector|reflecting escaping neutrons]] back into the plutonium core.

The isotope [[plutonium-238]] (Pu-238) has a half-life of 88&nbsp;years and emits a large amount of [[thermal energy]] as it decays without harmful [[gamma ray]]s. Being an [[Alpha particle|alpha emitter]], it combines high energy radiation with low penetration and thereby requires minimal shielding. In fact, one [[kilogram]] of plutonium-238 can generate 22&nbsp;million&nbsp;[[kilowatt-hour]]s of heat energy.<ref name = "Heiserman1992"/>{{inote|page 338}}

These characteristics make it well-suited for electrical power generation for devices which must function without direct maintenance for timescales approximating a human lifetime. It is therefore used in [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s such as those powering the [[Cassini probe|Cassini]], [[Voyager program|Voyager]] and [[New Horizons]] space probes. Earlier versions of the same technology powered the [[ALSEP]] and [[EASEP]] systems including [[seismology|seismic]] experiments on the [[Apollo 14]] Moon mission.<ref name = "Emsley2001"/>

Toxicity issues aside, care must be taken to avoid the accumulation of amounts of plutonium which approach [[Critical mass (nuclear)|critical mass]], particularly because plutonium's critical mass is only a third of that of uranium-235.<ref name = "Heiserman1992"/> A critical mass of plutonium emits lethal amounts of neutrons and [[gamma ray]]s.<ref name = "Miner1968p546">{{harvnb|Miner|1968|p = 546}}</ref> Plutonium in solution is more likely to form a critical mass than the solid form due to moderation by the hydrogen in water.<ref name = "CRC2006p4-27"/>

[[Criticality accident]]s have occurred in the past, some of them with lethal consequences. Careless handling of [[tungsten carbide]] bricks around a 6.2&nbsp;kg plutonium sphere resulted in a fatal dose of radiation at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] on August 21, 1945, when scientist [[Harry K. Daghlian, Jr.]] received a dose estimated to be 510&nbsp;[[Roentgen equivalent man|rems]] (5.1&nbsp;[[Sievert|Sv]]) and died 28&nbsp;days later.<ref>

}}</ref> It reacts chemically with oxygen and water, which may result in an accumulation of [[plutonium hydride]], a [[pyrophoric]] substance; that is, a material that will ignite in air at room temperature.<ref name = "NucSafety"/> Plutonium expands up to 70% in volume as it oxidizes and thus may break its container.<ref name = "NucSafety"/> The radioactivity of the burning material is an additional hazard. Magnesium oxide sand is the most effective material for extinguishing a plutonium fire.<ref name = "NucSafety"/> It cools the burning material, acting as a [[heat sink]], and also blocks off oxygen. There was a major plutonium-initiated fire at the [[Rocky Flats Plant]] near [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], [[Colorado]] in 1969.<ref>
