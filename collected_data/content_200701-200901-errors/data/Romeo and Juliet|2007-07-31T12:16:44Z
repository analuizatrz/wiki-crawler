'''''Romeo and Juliet''''' is a world-renowned [[tragedy]] by [[William Shakespeare]] concerning two young "[[Star-crossed|star-cross'd lovers]]" and the role played by their tragic [[suicide]]s in ending a long-running [[feud|family feud]]. It is one of the most famous of Shakespeare's plays, one of his earliest theatrical triumphs, and is thought to be the most [[archetype|archetypal]] love story of the [[Renaissance]] and indeed in the history of [[Western culture]].

Although ''Romeo and Juliet'' belongs to a tradition of tragic romances stretching back at least as far as the Ancient Greeks, it is based on an Italian tale, the earliest known version dating to 1476.  In 1562, Arthur Brooke translated one of the Italian tales into English, which was then retold in prose by [[William Painter]].  Brooke's poem and Painter's short story are considered to be Shakespeare's sources for ''Romeo and Juliet''.  Shakespeare borrowed heavily from both, but developed their minor characters, such as [[Mercutio]] and [[Count Paris]], in order to expand the plot. Although it is unknown exactly when the play was written, most scholars agree on 1595-1596.  The first know publication of the play was in Shakespeare's [[First Quarto]], published in 1597.  Later editions, such as the [[Second Quarto]] corrected the first version to make it more in line with Shakespeare's original text.

''Romeo and Juliet'' has been adapted several times.

''Romeo and Juliet'' is a dramatization of [[Arthur Brooke]]'s narrative poem ''[[The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet]]'' (1562). Shakespeare followed Brooke's poem closely<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Sources of Romeo and Juliet|author=Arthur J. Roberts|journal=Modern Language Notes|volume=17|issue=2|year=Feb 1902|pages=41-44}}</ref> but enriched its texture by adding extra detail to both major and minor characters, in particular the Nurse and [[Mercutio]]. Shakespeare also knew ''"The goodly History of the true and constant love of Rhomeo and Julietta"'', a prose retelling of the story by [[William Painter]], published in a compilation of Italian tales entitled ''Palace of Pleasure'' (1582).<ref>N. H. Keeble "York Notes on Romeo and Juliet" (Longman, 1980) p.18</ref> Painter's version was part of a common theme among writers and playwrights in publishing works based on Italian ''novelles''. At the time of Shakespeare's ''Romeo and Juliet'', Italian tales were very popular among theater-goers.  Gibbons considers Shakespeare took advantage of this, as evidenced by his writing of ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]'' and ''[[Measure for Measure]]'' along with ''Romeo and Juliet''. Critics of the day even complained of how often such Italian tales were borrowed to please the crowds.  The stories were so popular that the tale of ''Romeo and Juliet'' had been played on stage before Shakespeare wrote his version of it.<ref>Gibbons, Brian. ''Romeo and Juliet''.

<!-- [[Image:Romeo e Giulietta Da porto.jpg|right|thumb|Frontispiece of Luigi da Porto's ''Giulietta e Romeo'', c. 1530 - one of the earliest known renderings of the tale.]] -->
In keeping with this tradition of borrowing from Italy, Arthur Brooke's poem was actually a translation and adaptation of the Italian ''Giuletta e Romeo'', by [[Matteo Bandello]], included in his ''Novelle'' of 1554.<ref name = moore>Moore, Olin. "Bandello and Clizia." ''Modern Language Notes'' 52 (1937): 38-44.</ref> Bandello's story was the most famous and was translated into French (and into English by Brooke). It was also adapted by Italian theatrical troupes, some of whom performed in London at the time that Shakespeare was writing his plays.  Although nothing is known of the repertory of these itinerant troupes, it is possible that they performed a version of the story.<ref>[[Madeline Doran]], ''Endeavors of Art''. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1954: 132.</ref> 

Bandello's version was in turn an adaptation of [[Luigi da Porto]]'s ''Giulietta e Romeo'', included in his ''Istoria novellamente ritrovata di due Nobili Amanti'' (c. 1530).<ref name = moore/> Da Porto's version gave the story much of its modern form, including the names of the lovers, the rival families of Montecchi and Capuleti, and the location in [[Verona]], in the [[Veneto]].<ref name = Hosley>Hosley, Richard, editor.

Further back, ''Romeo and Juliet'' borrows from a tradition of tragic love stories going back at least as far as the [[Ancient Greeks]]. The story of [[Pyramus and Thisbe]], for example, is thought by many scholars to have influenced da Porto's version of the story. This tale contains parallels in the hatred of the two lovers' parents for each other, as well as Pyramus' falsely believing his mistress Thisbe is dead.<ref>Furness, Henry Howard (ed). ''A New Variorum Edition of Shakespeare: Romeo and Juliet''. New York:Dover Publications, Inc. 1963.</ref> [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Geoffrey Chaucer's]] ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'' also had an effect on Arthur Brooke's ''Romeus and Juliet'', with Brooke adjusting the Italian translation to reflect parts of this English classic. The ''[[Ephesian Tale|Ephisiaca]]'' of [[Xenophon]] of [[Ephesus]], written in the [[third century]], also contains several similarities to the play, such as a separation of lovers, and a potion which causes a deathlike sleep. [[Christopher Marlowe|Christopher Marlowe's]] ''[[Hero and Leander]]'' and ''[[Tragedy of Dido]]'' are similar stories written much closer to Shakespeare's day, but are thought to be less of a direct influence, although they may have created an atmosphere in which tragic love stories could thrive.<ref>Gibbons, pgs. 36-37</ref>

==Date and text== 
[[Image:Romeo and juliet title page.jpg |thumb|right|Title page of the Second Quarto of ''Romeo and Juliet'' (published 1599)]]
The exact date in which Shakespeare wrote ''Romeo and Juliet'' is unknown.  Scholars estimate that it may have been written in 1595 or 1596, though some argue for the year 1591.  Juliet's nurse refers to an earthquake which occurred eleven years ago.  An earthquake had occurred in England in 1580, dating that statement to 1591. The play's stylistic similarities with ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', as well as evidence of performances at the time (the play was becoming popular at around 1595), place the play in 1595 or 1596. Most agree that he may have begun a draft in 1591, which he completed in 1595-6.<ref>Draper, John W. "The Date of Romeo and Juliet." ''The Review of English Studies'' (Jan 1949) 25.97 pgs. 55-57</ref><ref>Gibbons, pgs. 26-31</ref>

Shakespeare's ''Romeo and Juliet'' was published in two distinct [[book size|quarto]] editions prior to the publication of the [[First Folio]] of 1623. These are referred to as [[First quarto|Q1]] and [[Second quarto|Q2]]. Q1, the first printed edition, appeared in 1597, printed by John Danter.  Because its text contains numerous differences from the later editions, it is labelled a '[[bad quarto]]': the twentieth century editor T. J .B. Spencer described it as "a detestable text, probably a reconstruction of the play from the imperfect memories of one or two of the actors."<ref name = quartos>T. J. B Spencer (ed.) The New Penguin Shakespeare "Romeo and Juliet" (Penguin, London, 1967) "An account of the Text" p.284</ref> Q1 indicates that, along with many other playwrights of the time, Shakespeare's plays were probably heavily edited before performances by playing companies, and ''Romeo and Juliet'' is no exception.<ref name = Jay>Halio, Jay. Romeo and Juliet. Westport: Greenwood Press, 1998. pg. 1 ISBN 0-313-30089-5</ref>

The superior [[Second quarto|Q2]] called the play ''The Most Excellent and Lamentable Tragedie of Romeo and Juliet''. It was printed in [[1599]], published by Cuthbert Burby and printed by Thomas Creede. Q2 is about 800 lines longer than [[first quarto|Q1]].<ref name = Jay/> Its title page describes it as "Newly corrected, augmented and amended". Scholars believe that this text was based on Shakespeare's pre-performance draft, (called his [[foul papers]]), since there are textual oddities such as variable tags for characters and "false starts" for speeches that were presumably struck through by the author but erroneously preserved by the typesetter. It is a much more complete and reliable text, and was reprinted in 1609 (Q3), 1622 (Q4) and 1637 (Q5).<ref name = quartos/> In fact, all later Quartos and Folios of ''Romeo and Juliet'' are based on Q2, offering little additional information on Shakespeare's original work.<ref>Jay, pg. 2</ref>

The First Folio text of 1623 seems to be based primarily on Q3, with some clarifications and corrections possibly coming from a theatrical promptbook or Q1.<ref name = quartos/><ref>Gibbons, pg. 21</ref> Other [[Folio]] editions of the play were printed in 1632 (F2), 1664 (F3), and 1685 (F4).<ref>Gibbons, ix</ref>  Modern versions considering several of the Folios and Quartos began printing with [[Nicholas Rowe|Nicholas Rowe's]] 1709 edition, followed by [[Alexander Pope|Alexander Pope's]] 1723 version.  Pope began a tradition of editing the play to add information such as stage directions missing in Q2 by locating them in Q1.  This tradition continued late into the Romantic period. Fully annotated editions began printing in the Victorian period and continue to this day, printing the text of the play with footnotes describing the sources and culture behind the play.<ref>Jay, pg. 8-9</ref>

==Synopsis==
{{quote|"Two Households, both alike in dignity ..."|Chorus}}
[[Image:Francesco Hayez 053.jpg|thumb|right|''Romeo and Juliet'' by [[Francesco Hayez]]]]
<!-- The play begins with a 14-line [[prologue]] by a Chorus in the form of a [[Shakespearean sonnet]]. It describes to the audience two noble families of [[Verona]] that have [[feud]]ed for generations, explaining that
two lovers from these families will take their lives in a tragic [[suicide]] that will "bury their parents' strife". --><!-- This doesn't really seem to be part of the plot, but could be placed elsewhere in the article. -->

The play begins with a street-battle between two families, the Montagues and the Capulets.  The Prince of [[Verona]], [[Prince Escalus|Escalus]], intervenes with his men and declares that the heads of the two families will be held personally accountable for any further breach of the peace.

Later, [[Count Paris]], a young nobleman, talks to Lord Capulet about marrying his thirteen-year-old daughter, [[Juliet Capulet|Juliet]]. Capulet demurs, citing the girl's tender age, and invites him to attract the attention of Juliet during a [[Masquerade ball|ball]] that the family is to hold that night. Meanwhile, Juliet's mother tries to persuade her daughter to accept Paris' wooing during their coming ball. Juliet states that she will make an effort to love him, but will not go after what is not there. In this scene Juliet's nurse is introduced as a talkative and humorous character who has raised Juliet from infancy.

Meantime, [[Benvolio]] queries his cousin [[Romeo Montague|Romeo]], Lord Montague's son, to find out the source of his melancholy. He discovers that it stems from an unrequited love for a girl named [[Rosaline]]. Upon the insistence of Benvolio and another friend, [[Mercutio]], Romeo decides to attend the masquerade at the Capulet house, in hope of meeting Rosaline.

Alongside his masked friends, Romeo attends the ball as planned, but instead falls for Juliet, and she with him. After discovering that the lovers are of feuding blood, Romeo and Juliet meet on Juliet's balcony. Despite their families' feud, the two declare their love for each other and their intent to marry. With the help of the [[Franciscan]] [[Friar Lawrence]], who hopes to reconcile the two families through their children's union, the two are [[marriage|married]] secretly the next day.

All seems well until [[Tybalt]], Juliet's hot-blooded [[cousin]], challenges Romeo to a [[duel]] for appearing in the Capulets' ball disguised. Though no one is aware of the marriage yet, Romeo refuses to fight Tybalt since they are now kinsmen.  Mercutio is incensed by Tybalt's insolence, and accepts on Romeo's behalf. In the ensuing duel, Mercutio is fatally wounded when Romeo tries to intervene. Romeo, angered by his friend's death, pursues and slays Tybalt, then flees.
[[Image:Leighton - Reconciliation watercolor.jpg|thumb|left|''The Reconciliation of the Montagues and Capulets'' (1854) by [[Frederic Leighton]]]]
Despite his promise to call for the head of the wrong-doers, the Prince merely [[exile]]s Romeo from Verona, reasoning that Tybalt first killed Mercutio, and Romeo merely carried out a just punishment to Tybalt, although without legal authority. Meanwhile, the Capulets engage their unwilling daughter to marry Paris in three days' time, threatening to disown her if she does not. The Nurse, once Juliet's confidante, now tells her she should discard the exiled Romeo and comply. Juliet desperately visits Friar Lawrence for help. He offers her a [[drug]] which will put her into a death-like coma for forty-two hours. She is to take it, and, when discovered apparently dead, she will be laid in the family [[crypt]]. While in her sleep, the Friar will send a messenger to inform Romeo, so that she can rejoin him when she awakes.

The messenger, however, does not reach Romeo. Romeo instead learns of Juliet's "death" from his servant Balthasar. Grief-stricken, he buys strong [[poison]] from an [[apothecary]], returns to Verona in secret, and visits the Capulets' crypt. He encounters Paris, who has come to mourn Juliet privately. Paris confronts Romeo, believing him to be a vandal, and in the ensuing battle, Romeo kills Paris. Romeo says his final words to the comatose Juliet and drinks the poison in [[suicide]]. Juliet then awakes. Friar Lawrence arrives and, aware of the cause of the tragedy, begs Juliet to leave, but she refuses. At the side of Romeo's dead body, she stabs herself with her lover's dagger.

The feuding families and the Prince meet at the tomb to find three of their families' dead. In explanation, Friar Lawrence recounts the story of the two lovers. Montague reveals that his wife has died of grief after hearing of her son's exile. The families are reconciled by their children's deaths and agree to end their violent feud.  The play ends with the Prince's brief [[elegy]] for the lovers. The Capulets erect a statue of Romeo and the Montagues will erect one of Juliet. The Prince makes his parting words: "For never was a story of more woe Than this of Juliet and her Romeo."

===Dramatic structure===
Shakespeare shows his dramatic skill freely in ''Romeo and Juliet'', providing intense moments of shift between comedy and tragedy, and weaving plots and subplots to paint a clearer picture of the story.  Before Mercutio's death in Act three, the play is largely a comedy.<ref>Shapiro, Stephen A. "[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0010-0994%28196404%2925%3A7%3C498%3ARAJRCT%3E2.0.CO%3B2-O Romeo and Juliet: Reversals, Contraries, Transformations, and Ambivalence]." ''College English''. 25.7 (Apr 1964) pp. 498-501 doi:10.2307/373235</ref> After his accidental demise, the play suddenly becomes very serious and takes on more of a tragic tone.  Still, the fact that Romeo is banished, rather than executed, offers a hope that things will work out. When Friar Laurence offers Juliet a plan to reunite her with Romeo the audience still has a reason to believe that all will end well. They are in a "breathless state of suspense" by the opening of the last scene in the tomb: If Romeo is delayed long enough for the Friar to arrive, he and Juliet may yet be saved.<ref>Bonnard, Georges A. "[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0034-6551%28195110%292%3A2%3A8%3C319%3ARAJAPS%3E2.0.CO%3B2-F Romeo and Juliet: A Possible Significance?]." ''The Review of English Studies: New Series.'' 2.8 (Oct 1951) pp. 319-327</ref> This only makes it all the more tragic when everything falls apart in the end.<ref name = plot>Halio, pgs. 20-30</ref>

Subplots offer a clearer view of the actions of the main characters, and provide an axis around which the main plot turns.  For example, when the play begins, Romeo is in love with Rosaline, who has refused all of his advances.  Romeo's infatuation with her stands in obvious contrast to his later love for Juliet. This provides a comparison through which the audience can see the seriousness of Romeo and Juliet's love and marriage. Paris' love for Juliet also sets up a contrast between Juliet's feelings for him and her feelings for Romeo. The formal language she uses around Paris, as well as the way she talks about him to her Nurse, show that her feelings clearly lie with Romeo. Beyond this, the sub-plot of the Montague-Capulet feud overarches the whole play, providing an atmosphere of hate that is the main contributor to the play's tragic end<ref name = plot/>

===Language===
Shakespeare uses a large variety of poetic forms throughout the play. The greater part of ''Romeo and Juliet'' is written in [[iambic pentameter]]. Though the most common form is [[blank verse]], Shakespeare uses it less often in this play than in his later plays.  Shakespeare matches the forms to the characters who use them. Friar Laurence, for example, uses [[sermon]] and [[sententiae]] forms, and the Nurse uses a unique [[blank verse]] form that closely matches colloquial speech. The forms are also molded and matched to characters and to the emotion of the scene they occupy.  For example, when Romeo talks about Rosaline earlier in the play, he uses the [[Petrarchan sonnet]] form.  Petrarchan sonnets classically were used by men to exaggerate the beauty of women who were impossible for them to attain, much like Romeo's situation with Rosaline.  This sonnet form is also used by Lady Capulet to describe Count Paris to Juliet as and handsome (though not unattainable) man.  When Romeo and Juliet meet, the poetic form changes from the Petrarchan (which was becoming archaic in Shakespeare's day) to a more contemporary sonnet form, using the language of "pilgrims" and "saints". Finally, when the two meet on the balcony, Romeo attempts to use the sonnet form to pledge his love to her, but Juliet breaks it by saying "Dost thou love me?"<ref>II.ii.90</ref> By doing this, she is searching for the reality, rather than the exaggeration of their love. Other forms include an [[epithalamium]] by Juliet, a [[rhapsody]] in Mercutio's [[Queen Mab]] speech, and an [[elegy]] by Paris. Shakespeare also uses a prose style, most often for the common people in the play, though at times for other characters, such as Mercutio.<ref name = lang>Halio, pgs. 48-60</ref>

===Themes and motifs===
Scholars have found it extremely difficult to assign one specific, over-arching theme to the play. Bowling considers the main theme to be "the discovery" by the characters that human beings are neither wholly good nor wholly evil, but instead are "more or less alike".<ref name= "Bowling">Bowling, Lawrence Edward. "[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0030-8129%28194903%2964%3A1%3C208%3ATTFORA%3E2.0.CO%3B2-W The Thematic Framework of Romeo and Juliet]." ''PMLA.'' 64.1 (Mar 1949) pp. 208-220 doi:10.2307/459678</ref> Numerous other attempts have proposed that the theme is awaking out of a dream and into reality, or the danger of hasty action, or the power of tragic fate.  None of these have widespread support. However, even if an overall theme cannot be found it is clear that the play is full of several small, thematic elements which intertwine in complex ways. Several of those which are most often debated by scholars are discussed below.<ref>Halio, pg. 65</ref>

====Light and dark====
{{pquote|"In ''Romeo and Juliet''...the dominating image is light, every form and manifestation of it; the sun, moon, stars, fire, lightning, the flash of gunpowder, and the reflected light of beauty and of love; while by contrast we have night, darkness, clouds, rain, mist, and smoke."|Caroline Spurgeon|<ref name = parker>Parker, D. H. "Light and Dark Imagery in Romeo and Juliet." ''Queen's Quarterly.'' 1968 75.4 pgs. 663-674</ref>}}

Scholars have long noted Shakespeare's widespread use of light and dark imagery throughout the play. The light theme was initially taken to be "symbolic of the natural beauty of young love", an idea beginning in Caroline Spurgeon's work ''Shakespeare's Imagery and What It Tells Us,'' although the perceived meaning has since its publication branched in several directions.<ref name="Nevo Tragic Form"/><ref name = parker/> The play contrasts light and dark in several ways.  For example, both Romeo and Juliet see the other as light in a surrounding darkness. Romeo describes Juliet as being like the sun,<ref>II.ii</ref> brighter than a torch,<ref>I.v.42</ref> a jewel sparkling in the night,<ref>I.v.44-45</ref> and a bright angel among dark clouds.<ref>II.ii.26-32</ref>  Even when she lies apparently dead in the tomb, he says her "beauty makes / This vault a feasting presence full of light."<ref>I.v.85-86</ref> Juliet describes Romeo as "day in night" and "Whiter than snow upon a raven's back."<ref>III.ii.17-19</ref><ref>Halio, pgs. 55-56</ref> This contrast of light and dark can be expanded as contrasting love and hate, youth and age in a metaphoric way.<ref name="Nevo Tragic Form">Nevo, Ruth. "[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0039-3657%28196921%299%3A2%3C241%3ATFIRAJ%3E2.0.CO%3B2-O Tragic Form in Romeo and Juliet]." ''Studies in English Literature, 1500-1900: Elizabethan and Jacobean Drama.'' 9.2  (Spring 1969) pp. 241-258 doi:10.2307/449778</ref> Sometimes the metaphor creates a dramatic irony.  For example, Romeo and Juliet's love is a light in the midst of the darkness of the hate around them, but all of their activity together is done in night and darkness, while all of the feuding is done in broad daylight. This paradox of imagery adds to the moral dillema facing the two lovers: loyalty to family or loyalty to love. This in turn adds significant dramatic effect and emotion to the story. At the end of the story, when the morning is gloomy and the sun hiding its face for sorrow, light and dark has been returned to its proper place, the outward darkness, reflecting the true, inner darkness of the family feud, out of sorrow for the lovers.  All characters now recognize their folly in light of recent events, and things return to the natural order, thanks to the love of Romeo and Juliet.<ref name = parker/>  The "light" theme in the play is also heavily connected to the theme of time, since light was a convienient way for Shakespeare to express the passage of time through descriptions of the sun, moon, and stars.<ref name="time"/>

====Fate and chance====
{{list to prose (section)}}
*The inevitability of fate.  Romeo and Juliet are star-crossed, they are fated never to be together.  In attempting to defy this fate, they ensure it.<ref>Evans, Bertrand. "The Brevity of Friar Laurence." ''PMLA'' 65.5 (September 1950): 841-865.</ref>
* Nevo considers the high degree to which chance is stressed in the narrative to make Romeo and Juliet a "lesser tragedy" of chance, not of character.  Romeo's challenging Tybalt is not impulsive, it is, after Mercutio's death, the expected action to take.  In this scene, Nevo reads Romeo as being aware of the dangers of flouting social norms, identity and commitments.<ref name="Nevo Tragic Form"/>
*Draper considers ''Romeo and Juliet'' to be a "tragedy of humours" in that several parallels can be drawn between the Elizabethan belief in [[Humorism|humours]] and the main characters of the play, for example, Tybalt as a choleric. Draper considers that interpreting the text in the light of the Elizabethan-era science of humorism reduces the amount of the plot that is attributed to chance by a modern audience.<ref name= "Draperhumorism">Draper, J. W. "[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0034-6551%28193901%291%3A15%3A57%3C16%3AS%22L%3E2.0.CO%3B2-C Shakespeare's 'Star-Crossed Lovers']." ''The Review of English Studies.'' 15.57 (Jan 1939) pp. 16-34</ref>

====Time====
Time plays an important role in the language and plot of the play. Both Romeo and Juliet refer to their struggle to maintain an imaginary world void of time and full of love in the face of the harsh realities of unstoppable time that surround them. For instance, when Romeo  attempts to swear his love to Juliet by the moon, Juliet tells him not to, as it is known to be inconstant over time, and she does not desire this of him. From the very beginning, the lovers are designated as "star-cross'd"<ref>Prologue</ref> referring to an [[astrology|astrologic]] belief which is heavily connected to time. Stars were thought to control the fates of men, and as time passed, stars would move along their course in the sky, also charting the course of human lives below. Romeo speaks of a foreboding he feels in the stars movements' early in the play, and when he learns of Juliet's death, he defies the stars' course for him. 

A "haste theme" can be considered as fundamental to the play.<ref name = time>Tanselle, G. Thomas. "[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0037-3222(196423)15%3A4%3C349%3ATIRAJ%3E2.0.CO%3B2-Z Time in Romeo and Juliet]." ''Shakespeare Quarterly.'' 15.4 (Autumn 1964) pp. 349-361 doi:10.2307/2868092</ref> For example, the action of ''Romeo and Juliet'' is generally considered to span a period of four to six days, in contrast to Brooke's poem spanning nine months.  Scholars such as Tanselle believe that time was "especially important to Shakespeare" in this play, as he used references to "short-time" for the young lovers as opposed to references to "long-time" for the "older generation" to highlight "a headlong rush towards doom".<ref name = time/> Romeo and Juliet repeatedly attempt to fight the effects of time in the world around them in their desire for their love to last forever. In the end, the only way they see to defeat time is through a timeless death which makes them noteworthy enough to be made immortal through art.<ref name = luck>Lucking, D.

Time is heavily connected to the theme of light and dark, as well.  Shakespeare's play is said in the Prologue to be about two hours long, creating a paradox for any playwright.<ref name = luck/> In Shakespeare's day, plays were often performed at noon in broad daylight, requiring the playwright to create his own methods for the illusion of passing time in his plays. Shakespeare uses references to the light and dark of night and day, the stars, the moon, and the sun to create this illusion.  He also has characters frequently refer to days of the week and specific hours of the day to help the audience understand that time has passed in the story. All in all, no fewer than 103 specific references to time are found in the play, adding to this illusion of its passage.<ref>Halio, pgs. 55-58</ref><ref>Driver, Tom F.

*Draper also finds significance in the summer setting of the play, whereas Brooke's poem opens in winter and spanned nine months.  Draper considers the summer setting of the play to contribute to the escalating conflicts in the narrative, due to the Elizabethan science of humorism.<ref name= "Draperhumorism"/> -->

====Love====
{{sect-stub}}
*''Romeo and Juliet'' is usually considered to have no unifying theme, save that of young love.  Bowling considers the main theme to be "the discovery" by the characters that human beings are neither wholly good nor wholly evil, but instead are "more or less alike".<ref name= "Bowling"/>
*"Sexual love is a manifestation of God's cosmic love" - In the middle ages, Love was considered to be a powerful god and force of nature that primarily influenced the young.  In the final suicide scene, there is a  contradiction in the message - in Christianity, suiciders are condemned to hell, whereas people who die to be with their loves under the "[[Courtly love|Religion of Love]]" are joined with their loves in paradise.  Romeo and Juliet's love seems to be expressing the "Religion of Love" view rather than the Christian view.  Another point is that although their love is passionate, it is only consummated in marriage, which prevents them from losing the audience's sympathy.<ref>Christianity and the Religion of Love</ref>

===Other approaches===
====Psychoanalytic====
[[Psychoanalytic criticism|Psychoanalytic critics]] focus largely on Romeo's depressive state with Rosaline before he meets Juliet, as well as the function of hate in their relationship as a result of the family feud. The looming image of inevitable death is explored as well. This line of criticism argues that Shakespeare is in love with Juliet because she is to him the all-present, all-powerful mother which he needs to fill a void he feels in his own mother. The feud between the families provides a source of phallic expression for the male Capulets and Montagues This sets up a system where patriarchal order is in power. When the sons are married, rather than focusing on the wife, they are still owed an obligation to their father and family.  This conflict between obligation to the father (the family name) and the wife (the feminine), determines the course of the play. Some critics argue this hatred is the sole cause of Romeo and Juliet's passion for each other. The fear of death and the knowledge of the danger of their risking a relationship is in this view channeled into a romantic passion.<ref>Halio, pgs. 81-87</ref>

====Feminist====
[[Feminist literary criticism|Feminist critics]] also point out that the blame for the family feud lies in the patriarchal order of society in Verona. The strict, masculine code of violence imposed on Romeo is the main force driving the tragedy to its end.  When Tybalt kills Mercutio, for example, Romeo shifts into this violent mode, regretting that Juliet has made him so "effeminate".<ref>III.i.112</ref> Juliet also submits to a female code of docility by allowing others, such as the Friar, to solve her problems for her. Other critics, such as Dympna Callaghan, look at the play's feminism from a more [[historicist]] angle.  They take into account the fact that the play is written during a time when the patriarchal order was being challenged by several forces, most notably the rise of Puritanism, which viewed marriage and sexuality as less of a necessary evil than other philosophies had done. For example, when Juliet dodges her father's attempt to force her to marry Paris in an attempt to stay with the man she really has feelings for, she is successfully challenging the patriarchal order in a way that would not have been possible at an earlier time.<ref>Halio, pg. 87-92</ref>

====Gender studies====
[[Gender studies|Gender studies critics]] largely question the sexuality of two characters, Mercutio and Romeo. The argument centers around the difference between sexual love and friendship, a difference which, in this view, Shakespeare discusses heavily in the play. Mercutio's friendship with Romeo, for example, leads to several friendly conversations, including ones on the subject of Romeo's [[phallus]]. This would seem to suggest traces of homoeroticism.<ref>Halio, pgs. 85-87</ref> Romeo, as well, admits traces of the same in his love for Rosaline and Juliet. Rosaline, it seems, is distant and unavailable except in the mind, bringing no hope of offspring.  As Benvolio argues, she is best replaced by someone who will reciprocate.  Shakespeare's [[procreation sonnets]] describe another young man who, like Romeo, is having trouble finding such a person, and who (possibly also like Romeo) is homosexual. In this view, when Juliet says "...that which we call a rose / By any other name would smell as sweet",<ref>Act 2 Scene 2</ref> she may be raising the question of whether there is any difference between the beauty of a man and the beauty of a woman.<ref name = queer>Goldberg, Jonathan.

===Stage history===
[[Image:Richard Burbage Portrait at Dulwich Picture gallery.jpg|thumb|left|[[Richard Burbage]], probably one of the first actors to portray [[Romeo Montague|Romeo]].<ref>Halio, 97</ref>]]''Romeo and Juliet'' was a popular play in Shakespeare's lifetime. Gary Taylor measures it as the sixth most popular of Shakespeare's plays, in the period after the death of [[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe]] and [[Thomas Kyd|Kyd]] but before the ascendancy of [[Ben Jonson|Jonson]] during which Shakespeare was London's dominant playwright.<ref>Gary Taylor "Shakespeare Plays on Renaissance Stages" in [[Stanley Wells]] and Sarah Stanton (eds.) "The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare on Stage" (Cambridge University Press, 2002) p.18. The five more popular plays, in descending order, are [[Henry VI, Part 1]], [[Richard III (play)|Richard III]], [[Pericles, Prince of Tyre|Pericles]], [[Hamlet]] and [[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]</ref>

After the theatres re-opened in the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], Sir [[William Davenant]] staged a 1662 production in which [[Henry Harris]] played Romeo, [[Thomas Betterton]] was Mercutio, and Betterton's wife [[Mary Saunderson]] played Juliet.<ref>Van Lennep, William, editor. ''The London Stage, 1660-1800''. Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1965: 1:48.</ref> [[Thomas Otway]]'s adaptation ''The History and Fall of Caius Marius'', one of the more extreme of the Restoration versions of Shakespeare, debuted in 1680. The scene is shifted from Renaissance Verona to ancient Rome; Romeo is Marius, Juliet is Lavinia, the feud is between patricians and plebians; Juliet/Lavina wakes from her potion before Romeo/Marius dies. Otway's version was a hit, and was acted for the next seventy years. [[Theophilus Cibber]] mounted his own adaptation in 1744, followed by [[David Garrick]]'s in 1748. Both Cibber and Garrick used variations on Otway's innovation in the tomb scene.<ref>Jean I. Marsden "Shakespeare from the Restoration to Garrick" in [[Stanley Wells]] and Sarah Stanton (eds.) "The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare on Stage" (Cambridge University Press, 2002) pp.26-27</ref>

In 1750 came the so-called "Battle of the Romeos," with [[Spranger Barry]] and [[Susannah Maria Arne]] (Mrs. Theophilus Cibber) at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] versus [[David Garrick]] and [[George Anne Bellamy]] at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]].<ref>Pedicord, Harry William. ''The Theatrical Public in the Time of David Garrick''.

Halliday, ''A Shakespeare Companion 1564-1964,'' Baltimore, Penguin, 1964; pp. 125, 365, 420.</ref>

[[Henry Irving]]'s 1882 production at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]] is considered an archetype of his "pictorial" style, placing the action on elaborate sets. Irving hmself played Romeo, and [[Ellen Terry]] played Juliet.<ref>Richard W. Scooch "Pictorial Shakespeare" in [[Stanley Wells]] and Sarah Stanton (eds.) "The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare on Stage" (Cambridge University Press, 2002) pp.62-63</ref>

In one of the most notable twentieth century performances, staged by [[John Gielgud]] at the [[Noël Coward Theatre|New Theatre]] in 1935, Gielgud and [[Laurence Olivier]] played the roles of Romeo and Mercutio, exchanging roles six weeks into the run, with [[Peggy Ashcroft]] as Juliet.<ref>Robert Smallwood "Twentieth-century Performance" in [[Stanley Wells]] and Sarah Stanton (eds.) "The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare on Stage" (Cambridge University Press, 2002) p.102</ref>

Other notable twentieth century productions include [[Guthrie McClintic|Guthrie McClintic's]] [[1934]] [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] staging in which [[Katharine Cornell]] had a triumph as Juliet opposite [[Basil Rathbone]] as Romeo and [[Edith Evans]] (who also played the role in the [[John Gielgud|Gielgud]] production) as the Nurse. Cornell later revived the production with [[Maurice Evans (actor)|Maurice Evans]] as Romeo and [[Ralph Richardson]] as Mercutio, both making their [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debuts. [[Franco Zeffirelli]] mounted a legendary staging for the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] in 1962 with [[John Stride]] and [[Judi Dench]] that served as the basis for his [[Romeo and Juliet (1968 film)|1968 film]].{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

===Stage adaptations===
[[Image:Romeo and Juliet.jpg|thumb|right|Romeo and Juliet statue in [[Central Park]] in [[New York City]].]]
When Romeo and Juliet is adapted for the stage, it is usually set in a modern or well-known historical setting, enabling audiences to understand, and perhaps to reflect upon, the underlying conflicts. For example, adaptations have been set in the midst of the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]],<ref>Pape, Ilan. "Post-Zionist Critique on Israel and the Palestinians Part III: Popular Culture." ''Journal of Palestine Studies'' 26 (1997): 69.</ref> in the [[apartheid]] era in [[South Africa]],<ref>Quince, Rohan. ''Shakespeare in South Africa: Stage Productions During the Apartheid Era''. New York: Peter Lang, 2000: 121-125</ref> and in the aftermath of the [[Pueblo Revolt]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Klugman|first=Deborah|url=http://www.laweekly.com/index.php?option=com_lsd&task=film&Itemid=109&id=81675|title=Kino and Teresa review|publisher=[[LA Weekly]]|accessdate=2007-02-17}}</ref> The most famous such adaptation is [[Peter Ustinov]]'s 1956 comic adaptation, [[Romanoff and Juliet]], set in a fictional mid-European country in the depths of the [[Cold War]].{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

===Music===
At least 24 [[opera]]s and plays have been based on Romeo and Juliet, the best known being [[Charles Gounod|Gounod]]'s ''[[Roméo et Juliette]]'' (1867) and [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]]'s opera ''[[I Capuleti e i Montecchi]]''<ref>{{cite journal|title=Measure for Measure: Shakespeare and Music|journal=Music Educators Journal|volume=54|issue=7|year=Mar 1968|author=Eve R. Meyer|page=36-38}}</ref>. The [[libretto]] in Gounod's play was by [[Jules Barbier]] and [[Michel Carré]]{{Fact|date=July 2007}}. Although Bellini and his librettist, [[Felice Romani]], worked from Italian sources, only distantly related to Shakespeare's work.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} In 2004 American composer [[Lee Hoiby]] also adapted ''Romeo and Juliet'' to write an opera of the same name.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

Since the 18th century, several [[ballet]] versions have been composed, the best known being [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)|Romeo and Juliet]]'', first performed in [[1938]].{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

[[Roméo et Juliette (symphony)|Roméo et Juliette]] by [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]] is a "symphonie dramatique", a large scale work in three parts for mixed voices, chorus and orchestra, premiered in 1839.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} [[Romeo and Juliet (Tchaikovsky)|The Romeo and Juliet Fantasy Overture]] (1869, revised 1870 and 1880), by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] is a long symphonic poem, containing one of the world's most famous melodies, the "love theme".{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

The play led to a number of [[musical theatre]] adaptations, the most famous of which was ''[[West Side Story]]'' with music by [[Leonard Bernstein]] and lyrics by [[Stephen Sondheim]]. It debuted on Broadway in 1957 and in London's West End in 1958, and became a popular film in 1961. This version updated the setting to mid-20th century [[New York City]], and the warring families to ethnic gangs.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} Other musical adaptations include [[Terrence Mann]]'s 1999 rock musical ''William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet'', co-written with Jerome Korman,{{Fact|date=July 2007}} and [[Gérard Presgurvic]]'s 2001 ''[[Roméo et Juliette, de la Haine à l'Amour]]''.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

<!--This is a SUMMARY. Please don't add new information or details here, but instead at the main article [[Romeo and Juliet on screen]]!-->
In putting Romeo and Juliet on [[Shakespeare on screen|screen]], the director must set the action in a social context that illuminates the characters, and mediates between the Renaissance play and modern audiences.<ref>Tatspaugh, Patricia "The Tragedy of Love on Film" in Jackson, Russell "The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare on Film" (Cambridge University Press, 2000, ISBN 0-521-63975-1) p.135</ref> [[George Cukor]], in 1970, commented on why his "stately" and "stodgy" [[Romeo and Juliet (1936 film)|1936 film]] had not stood the test of time, saying that if he had the opportunity to make it again he would "get the garlic and the mediterranean into it".<ref>Tatspaugh,  p.136</ref> Yet that performance (featuring [[Norma Shearer]] and [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]], with a combined age over 75, as the teenage lovers) had garnered no fewer than four [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nominations.<ref>Tatspaugh, p.136</ref> 

The films' openings highlight each director's care to establish authenticity: Cukor introduces his characters in a shot of a scene played on a [[proscenium]] stage; [[Renato Castellani]]'s [[Romeo and Juliet (1954 film)|1954 version]] opens with [[John Gielgud]], famous as a stage Romeo, as the Prologue in Elizabethan doublet and hose; Zeffirelli sets his scene with an overview of Verona, and his Prologue, in voiceover, was another famous stage Romeo: [[Laurence Olivier]]. In contrast, [[William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet|Romeo + Juliet]] in 1996 was targeted at a young audience, and opens with images of television and print journalism.<ref>Tatspaugh, p.136</ref>

A particular difficulty for the screen-writer arises towards the end of the fourth act, where Shakespeare's play requires considerable compression to be effective on the big screen, without giving the impression of "cutting to the chase".<ref>Jackson, Russell "From play-script to screenplay" in Jackson, Russell "The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare on Film" (Cambridge University Press, 2000, ISBN 0-521-63975-1) p.30</ref> In [[Franco Zeffirelli]]'s [[Romeo and Juliet (1968 film)|1968 version]], Juliet's return home from the Friar's cell, her submission to her father and the preparation for the wedding are drastically abbreviated, and similarly the tomb scene is cut short: Paris does not appear at all, and Benvolio (in the Balthazar role) is sent away but is not threatened.<ref>Russell, p.30</ref> In [[Baz Luhrmann]]'s [[William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet|Romeo + Juliet]], the screenplay allows Juliet to witness Romeo's death, and the role of the watch is cut, permitting Friar Lawrence to remain with Juliet and to be taken by surprise by her sudden suicide.<ref>Russell, p.31</ref>

Including the four major theatrical releases already mentioned, Shakespeare's play has been filmed over 40 times.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} Several of the adaptations of the story have also been filmed, most notably [[West Side Story]], [[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)|Prokofiev's ballet]] and [[Romanoff and Juliet]]. Also, several theatrical films, such as [[Shakespeare in Love]] and [[Romeo Must Die]], consciously use elements of Shakespeare's plot.
