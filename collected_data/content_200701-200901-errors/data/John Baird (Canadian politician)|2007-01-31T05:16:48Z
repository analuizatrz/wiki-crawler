'''John Russell Baird,''' [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada|PC]], [[Canadian House of Commons|MP]] (born [[May 26]], [[1969]]) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] politician.  He was elected to the [[Canadian House of Commons]] for [[Ottawa West—Nepean]] in the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 federal election]], and currently serves in the [[Canadian cabinet|cabinet]] of [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] as [[Minister of the Environment (Canada)|Minister of the Environment]].  He is a member of the [[Conservative Party of Canada]].

Baird previously served in the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]] from 1995 to 2005, and was a [[cabinet minister]] in the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Progressive Conservative]] governments of [[Mike Harris]] and [[Ernie Eves]].  

==Early life and career==

Baird was born in [[Ottawa, Ontario|Ottawa]], [[Ontario]].  He was president of the youth wing of the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party in the late 1980s, and supported [[Dennis Timbrell]] during the latter's two unsuccessful bids to lead the provincial party in 1985.  At sixteen years old, Baird was the youngest delegate to attend the party's [[Ontario Progressive Conservative leadership conventions, 1985|January 1985 leadership convention]].<ref>Jake Rupert and Shannon Proudfoot, "Baird takes Liberal stronghold", ''Ottawa Citizen'', 24 January 2006, D3.</ref>  Baird has also indicated that he was charged with trespassing during the [[Canadian federal election, 1988|1988 federal election]], after he tried to question [[Premier of Ontario|Ontario Premier]] [[David Peterson]] about [[Canada-US Free Trade Agreement|free trade with the United States]] during a [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] campaign stop in a Kingston shopping mall.<ref>Duncan McMonagle, "Peterson cites examples of U.S. woe in bid to block deal", ''Globe and Mail'', 7 November 1988, A8.</ref>  He received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in Political Studies from [[Queen's University (Kingston)|Queen's University]] in 1992.

Baird worked on the political staff of [[Perrin Beatty]] when he was federal [[Minister of National Defence (Canada)|Minister of National Defence]] in the early 1990s, and followed Beatty through subsequent cabinet shifts culminating in his becoming [[Secretary of State for External Affairs (Canada)|Secretary of State for External Affairs]] in the short-lived government of [[Kim Campbell]].<ref>"A sketch of Environment Minister John Baird", ''Canadian Press'', 4 January 2007, 14:39.</ref>  After the defeat of the federal Progressive Conservatives in the [[Canadian federal election, 1993|1993 federal election]], Baird worked as a lobbyist in Ottawa.<ref>Daniel Drolet, "Youngest MPP comes of age", ''Ottawa Citizen'', 5 September 1995, B3.</ref>

==Provincial politics==
===Government backbencher===

While Baird had previously been associated with moderate Tories such as Timbrell and Beatty, he became associated with the more right-wing ideology of the [[Mike Harris]]-led Ontario PC party upon entering provincial politics.  He was first elected to the Ontario legislature in [[Ontario general election, 1995|1995]], defeating [[Ontario Liberal Party|Liberal]] incumbent [[Hans Daigeler]] in the Ottawa-area riding of [[Nepean (electoral district)|Nepean]].  The youngest member of the legislature, Baird was appointed [[parliamentary assistant]] to the [[Minister of Labour (Ontario)|Minister of Labour]] on [[July 13]], [[1995]].

Baird made a number of controversial statements during his early legislative career.  When the mother of a severely disabled five-year-old child was ejected from the legislature in late 1995 for protesting the Harris government's cutbacks, Baird shouted "She's an [[Ontario Public Service Employees Union|OPSEU]] (Ontario Public Service Employees Union) member" from his legislative seat as many as three times.  Some considered this to be a cavalier insult, and his seatmate [[Chris Stockwell]] later recalled that he told Baird to "shut the ---- up" after the last such occurrence.<ref>Jim Coyle, "John Baird, we'll be watchin' you", ''Toronto Star'', 29 June 1999, p. 1.</ref>  Baird later said his comments were taken out of context, and that he was responding to a question from another MPP about the woman's employment.  He offered an unconditional apology to anyone who took offense.<ref>Kelly Toughill, "Pleading mom ejected from legislature", ''Toronto Star'', 29 November 1995, A3.</ref>  On another occasion, during a televised debate in early 1996, Baird acknowledged that his government's privatization policies would likely result in lower wages for workers, but argued this would be balanced out by lower prices for consumers.<ref>Thomas Walkom, "Tories would trade good jobs for bad", ''Toronto Star'', 29 February 1996, A25.</ref>  

He became parliamentary assistant to [[Chair of the Management Board of Cabinet (Ontario)|Chair of the Management Board of Cabinet]] in April 1997, and was promoted to parliamentary assistant to the [[Minister of Finance (Ontario)|Minister of Finance]] in November of the same year.  As a backbencher, Baird proposed a bill officially naming [[Highway 416 (Ontario)|Highway 416]] as the "Veterans' Memorial Highway" and successfully steered its passage through the legislature.<ref>[http://www.johnbaird.com/pdf/positivechange.pdf 2006 campaign literature John Baird, campaign literature for the 2006 federal election] accessed [[December 26]] [[2005]].</ref>  He was re-elected without difficulty in [[Ontario general election, 1999|1999]].

===Community and Social Services minister===

Baird joined Premier Harris's cabinet on [[June 17]], [[1999]] as [[Ontario Minister of Community and Social Services|Minister of Community and Social Services]], where he became responsible for implementing and expanding Ontario's [[workfare]] program.  As one of Harris's few [[bilingual]] ministers, he was also named as [[Office of Francophone Affairs|Minister responsible for Francophone Affairs]].  

====1999====

Baird's first press conference as a cabinet minister was held in July 1999, and was intended to highlight the Harris government's record in reducing the provincial welfare rolls.  Baird told reporters that 15,000 people had left the system since the introduction of workfare, and used this figure to argue that the government's policy was a success.  He was unable to provide information on the number of workfare recipients who actually found jobs, however, and was unable to account for 40% of the welfare recipients who had been cut from the list.<ref>Jane Coutts, "15,000 fell off welfare in July, Tories say ", ''Globe and Mail'', 17 August 1999, A7 and Caroline Mallan, "Workfare stats elude minister", ''Toronto Star'', 17 August 1999, p. 1.  Both articles were extremely critical of Baird's ability to handle difficult questions.</ref>  The press conference received generally negative reviews, and a number of media reports subsequently criticized both the principle and the implementation of workfare in Ontario.<ref>One political columnist, [[Ian Urquhart]], described the program as "largely a fraud".  See Ian Urquhart, "Workfare program a fraud", ''Toronto Star'', 18 August 1999, p. 1.</ref>  

A September 1999 report from Baird's department showed that 10,600 workfare placements had been created in the first six months of 1999, a figure which the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' observed was significantly lower than that which had been predicted by the government.<ref>"Hardly a triumph", ''Toronto Star'', 5 November 1999, p. 1.</ref>  Baird indicated that he would continue with the workfare program, and that the proportion of welfare recipients on workfare would be increased from 15% to 30%.<ref>Richard Mackie, "Ontario workfare plans won't work", ''Globe and Mail'', 31 December 1999, A7.</ref>

Baird came under criticism in late 1999 for refusing to cancel a five-year contract that had been signed between his department and the [[Bermuda]]-based private firm [[Andersen Consulting]] (later [[Accenture]]), worth up to $180 million.  The contract, signed when [[Janet Ecker]] was Community and Social Services minister, entrusted Andersen with providing technological upgrades to the province's welfare management system.  The arrangement was criticized by Auditor General [[Erik Peters]], who observed that there was nothing in the contract to prevent Andersen from increasing its hourly rates.<ref>Theresa Boyle, "Some consulting service fees higher, ministry confirms", ''Toronto Star'', 10 December 1999, p. 1.</ref>  A published report in early 2000 indicated that Andersen was charging an average of $257 per hour for work that had previously been done by ministry staff at $51 per hour.  Another report indicated that the firm had charged a total of $55 million to find roughly $66 million worth of savings.<ref>"Ontario Tories real perpetrators of welfare fraud", ''Toronto Star'', 15 January 2000; Colin Perkel, "Tracking device angers opposition", ''Toronto Star'', 31 March 2000, p. 1.</ref>  In response to opposition questions, Baird said that he would not terminate the contract but would endeavour to negotiate a lower rate.<ref>"Ontario rejects call to fire firm", ''Winnipeg Free Press'', 10 December 1999, B6.  In [[2005]], a glitch in Accenture's computer system prevented an increase in payments for Ontarians with disabilities.</ref>

Baird opposed the Harris government's plan to amalgamate the city of Ottawa with neighbouring municipalities, but was unable to prevent it from passing the legislature in 1999.<ref>Dan Nolan, "Tory MPPs talk merger with caucus", ''Hamilton Spectator'', 30 November 1999, A01.</ref>

====2000====

In January 2000, Baird unveiled a series of initiatives designed to reduce fraud and misuse in the welfare system, highlighted by the establishment of a welfare fraud hotline.<ref>"Government Continues Crackdown on Welfare Fraud and Misuse", ''Canada NewsWire'', 6 January 2000, 10:45 report.</ref>  Three months later, he announced that anyone convicted of welfare fraud would run the risk of being given a lifetime ban from the program.<ref>"Ontario's Zero Tolerance Policy on Welfare Cheats Effective Today", ''Canada NewsWire'', 1 April 2000.</ref>  Critics of this approach suggested that the Harris government was overstating the extent of fraud in order to undermine public confidence in welfare programs.<ref>Richard Mackie, "Ontario 'inflating' welfare fraud", ''Globe and Mail'', 7 January 2000, A8.</ref>  In mid-year, Baird announced that workfare placements had reached departmental quotas for most of the province.<ref>James McCarten, "Ontario workfare placements finally up to snuff: Baird", ''Canadian Press'', 5 June 2000, 16:02 report.</ref> 

Baird announced a $50 million program in May 2000 to help people with [[developmental disabilities]]  become integrated into their communities.<ref>"Disabled people to get more funds", ''Globe and Mail'', 6 May 2000, A9.</ref>  He later announced that the province was considering closing its remaining three institutions for the mentally handicapped as part of a larger strategy focusing on home care.  Baird expressed concern about the physical condition of these institutions, saying that their residents "deserve better".<ref>Tom Blackwell, "Ontario could close institutions for mentally disabled", ''National Post'', 15 September 2000, A04.</ref>

Baird's department produced a four-page brochure highlighting his government's record of welfare reform in the summer of 2000.  The piece cost $780,000, and was criticized by opposition MPPs as a waste of government expenditures.<ref>James Stevenson, "Brochure touting Ontario's welfare programs costs taxpayers", ''Canadian Press'', 14 July 2000, 15:30 report.</ref>  

Later in the year, Baird announced that his department would spend $26 million on shelters and other funding for the homeless.  This decision was praised as a positive step, although opposition members criticized the plan for not providing funds for investment in affordable housing.<ref>James Stevenson, "Ontario to spend $26 million on shelters and programs for homeless", ''Canadian Press'', 21 December 2000, 17:59 report.</ref>  

=====Drug testing policy=====

Baird supported mandatory drug-testing for welfare recipients, and argued that those who refused such tests should be at risk of have their funding cut off.  He introduced a policy initiative to this effect at a press conference in late 2000, in which he dramatically cast a box of [[syringe]]s onto the floor and said that his department planned to "stop people from shooting their welfare cheque up their arm, and to help them shoot up the ladder of success".  Baird acknowledged that his department did not have reliable figures on the number of welfare recipients abusing drugs, although he cited estimates of between 4% and 10%.<ref>Tom Blackwell, "Civil rights group may challenge drug testing", ''National Post'', 15 November 2000, A27.</ref>

This proposal was met with criticism from several sources, and Ontario Human Rights Commissioner [[Keith Norton]], himself a former Progressive Conservative cabinet minister, expressed concern that it could violate basic civil liberties.<ref>Theresa Boyle, "Welfare drug test plan sets off storm", ''Toronto Star'', 15 November 2000, p. 1.</ref>  The tone of Baird's announcement was also criticized, with the ''Toronto Star'' accusing him of "doing his utmost [...] to incite fear and loathing of the poor, doubling the stigma the most vulnerable in society bear".<ref>"Baird really sticking it to the poor", ''Toronto Star'', 18 November 2000, p. 1.</ref>  When campaigning for federal office five years later, Baird acknowledged that the syringe event demonstrated "immature judgement".<ref>"Baird is the clear choice", ''Ottawa Citizen'', 17 January 2006, B4.</ref>

Shortly after Baird's announcement, a government website operated by the Ministry of Community and Social Services launched a partisan attack against Liberal Party leader [[Dalton McGuinty]] for opposing the drug testing plan.  The site claimed that McGuinty was "opposed to helping welfare recipients who are addicted to drugs".  Baird denied that the message was partisan, and initially refused to apologize.<ref>Richard Mackie, "Government-funded Web site launches attack on McGuinty", ''Globe and Mail'', 6 December 2000, A7.</ref>  The [[Speaker of the Ontario Legislature]] subsequently ruled that the site content was inappropriate, and it was removed with an apology from the government.<ref>"Tories-web attack", ''Broadcast News'', 13 December 2000, 14:55 report.</ref>  Some aspects of the drug-testing plan were scaled back in 2001 due to legal complications.<ref>Richard Mackie, "Ontario pares down drug-testing proposal", ''Globe and Mail'', 9 January 2001, A5.</ref>

====2001-02====

In early 2001, Baird announced that his government's proposed drug-testing plan would be extended to identify welfare recipients addicted to prescription drugs and alcohol.<ref>Tom Blackwell, "Tories to force alcoholics on welfare into treatment", ''National Post'', 26 January 2001, A02.</ref>  He later announced that provincial welfare applicants would be required to pass a literacy test.<ref>Tom Blackwell, "Literacy to be mandatory to get welfare", ''National Post'', 4 May 2001, A04.</ref>

The Harris government's welfare policies were put under scrutiny in August 2001, when a pregnant woman in [[Sudbury, Ontario|Sudbury]] died while serving a house arrest for welfare fraud.  The woman had been confined to her apartment for three months, and reports indicated that her pregnancy was "exacerbated by sweltering conditions in her apartment".  Responding to criticism, Baird said that he could not comment on the specifics of the case until a coroner's inquest was completed.<ref>Mark MacKinnon and Keith Lacey, "Bleak House", ''Globe and Mail'', 18 August 2001, F1.</ref>  He also defended his government's general policy on welfare issues.<ref>"Province defends welfare rules after death of pregnant Sudbury, Ont., woman", ''Canadian Press'', 17 August 2001, 08:50 report.</ref>  A subsequent inquest did not assign blame to the government for the woman's death, but recommended that lifetime bans for fraud be eliminated, and that adequate food, housing and medication be provided to anyone under house arrest.<ref>[http://www.elizabethfry.ca/rogers/3.htm "Selected Inquest Recommendations", Elizabeth Fry Society], online document.</ref>

===Minister responsible for Children===


Baird was given additional responsibilities as [[Minister responsible for Children (Ontario)|Minister responsible for Children]] on February 8, 2001.  His department increased funding for child services early in the year, amid a significant increase in provincial demand.<ref>Martin Mittelstaedt, "Funding boosted for child services", ''Globe and Mail'', 15 February 2001, A16.</ref>  In November 2001, the provincial media obtained a confidential government report recommending 40-45% cuts in provincial child-care programs.  Baird initially declined to comment on the document's contents, but he rejected its proposals in early 2002.<ref>"Minister silent on child-care paper", ''Toronto Star'', 15 November 2001, p. 33; Cassandra Szklarski, "Ontario's Tories say no plan to slash child care as indicated in leaked report", ''Canadian Press'', 17 January 2002, 17:12 report.</ref>

===Chief Government Whip===

Baird was the first cabinet minister to support [[Jim Flaherty]]'s campaign to succeed Mike Harris as Progressive Conservative Party leader in the party's [[Ontario Progressive Conservative leadership election, 2002|2002 leadership election]].<ref>Richard Mackie, "Three ministers surge ahead in Tory race", ''Globe and Mail'', 29 October 2001, A10.</ref>  The election was won by Flaherty's rival [[Ernie Eves]], and early media reports suggested that Baird might be dropped from the new premier's cabinet in April 2002.<ref>Caroline Mallan and Richard Brennan, "Eves gives rival plum job", ''Toronto Star'', 15 April 2002, A19.</ref>  He was not, but was demoted to the position of [[Chief Government Whip (Ontario)|Chief Government Whip]] while remaining associate minister for Francophone Affairs.  His replacement in Social Services was [[Brenda Elliott]], who was from the more centrist wing of the Progressive Conservative Party.

===Energy Minister===

Baird was returned to a more prominent cabinet position in August 2002, when Eves separated the ministries of [[Minister of the Environment (Ontario)|Environment]] and [[Minister of Energy (Ontario)|Energy]] and appointed him to head the latter department.  As Energy Minister, Baird was initially entrusted with implementing the government's plan to sell off part of Ontario's [[Hydro One]].<ref>Colin Perkel, "Ministry in such hot water, Eves splits duties", ''Hamilton Spectator'', 23 August 2002, B05.</ref>  A few months later, he became unexpectedly involved in two major and interrelated policy reversals.

The Energy ministry came under intense media scrutiny in late 2002, when hydro rates increased significantly in many parts of the province.  Critics charged that the Progressive Conservative government's price deregulation policy (implemented before Baird became Energy Minister) was to blame, although Baird initially suggested that the rate increases resulted from an unusually hot summer.<ref>Chinta Puxley and Fred Vallance-Jones, "High bills shock consumers", ''Hamilton Spectator'', 25 September 2002, A12.</ref>  Rates remained high through the autumn, and the Eves government was forced to re-regulate the market in November by introducing a price cap.<ref>Rajiv Sekhri, "Ontario caps power rates as deregulation unravels", ''Reuters News'', 11 November 2002, 19:07 report.</ref>  The government continued to support deregulation in principle, but maintained the cap for the remainder of its term in office.  The second and more fundamental reversal occurred in late January 2003, when Premier Eves personally announced that Hydro One would remain under public control.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/stories/2003/01/20/hydroone_030120 "Hydro sale dead: Eves", CBC News Report], 20 January 2003 (revised 4 December 2003, 8:43:55)</ref>

Baird was less combative as Energy Minister than he had been in Community and Social Services.  The energy policies of the Eves government were very controversial, but opposition criticism was often directed at the premier rather than at Baird.  Eves took a prominent interest in the Energy portfolio, and sometimes relegated Baird to a secondary role in policy announcements.  

In early March 2003, Baird announced that the government might be forced to implement rolling blackouts as a response to energy shortages.<ref>John Spears, "Power supply woes loom?", ''Toronto Star'', 4 March 2003, A01.</ref>  He encouraged conservation in late summer 2003, following a province-wide blackout caused by a generator failure in the [[United States of America|United States]].<ref>"Ontario averts new blackout, but hot weather stirs fears", ''Winnipeg Free Press'', 20 August 2003, A11.</ref>  

Baird was also able to demonstrate his sense of humour during this period.  In November 2002, he was followed around the province by "Hydrozilla", a man in a giant lizard suit sent by the opposition [[Ontario New Democratic Party|New Democrats]] as a media stunt to highlight the NDP's view that deregulating electricity rates would create an economic monster for consumers.  At one point, when he was certain no cameras were around, Baird gave Hydrozilla a bear hug.<ref>Robert Benzie and Graham Richardson, "They're calling it 'Electrocution Week'", ''National Post'', 18 November 2002, A12.</ref>  

Baird was given additional responsibilities as [[Government House Leader (Ontario)|Government House Leader]] in June 2003, when [[Chris Stockwell]] was forced to resign after allegations that he had used government funds for a family vacation.<ref>April Lindgren, "Stockwell quits over expenses", ''National Post'', 17 June 2003, A1.</ref>

===Opposition member===

The Ontario Liberal Party won a [[majority government]] in the [[Ontario general election, 2003|2003 election]], although Baird was comfortably re-elected in his own seat.  Between 2003 and 2005, he served as [[Official Opposition]] critic for Finance, Culture, Francophone Affairs, Intergovernmental Affairs and Health.  He opposed the imposition of a health premium by [[Dalton McGuinty]]'s government in 2004, and was a vocal critic of Speaker [[Alvin Curling]], at one point describing his job performance as an "absolute disgrace".<ref>Rob Ferguson, "New premium won't be listed separately on pay", ''Toronto Star'', 19 May 2004, A09; "'Dysfunctional' legislature shocks Tory", ''CanWest News Service'', 17 December 2004, A11.</ref>

Baird co-chaired Jim Flaherty's second campaign to lead the Progressive Conservative party in the [[Ontario Progressive Conservative leadership election, 2004|2004]].  Flaherty was again defeated, losing on the second count to the more centrist [[John Tory]].<ref>Ian Urquhart, "Tories are lining up to replace Eves", ''Hamilton Spectator'', 21 January 2004, A11.</ref>  Both Baird and Flaherty left provincial politics in 2005 to campaign for the federal House of Commons.

Although Baird was generally on the right-wing of the provincial Progressive Conservative Party, he expressed liberal views on some social issues.  He supported [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|same-sex marriage]] during the [[Ontario general election, 2003|2003 provincial election]], and in 2005 helped the McGuinty government achieve quick passage of a provincial bill granting legal recognition to same-sex couples.  Some Progressive Conservative MPPs openly criticized Baird on the latter occasion.<ref>Karen Howlett, "Ontario approves same-sex law", ''Globe and Mail'', 25 February 2005, A9.</ref>

==Federal politics==

Baird supported a [[Canadian Alliance]] candidate in the [[Canadian federal election, 2000|2000 federal election]], and supported [[Stephen Harper]]'s bid to lead the newly-formed Conservative Party of Canada in its [[Conservative Party of Canada leadership election, 2004|2004 leadership election]].<ref>Tonda McCharles, "Harper fast out of the blocks", ''Toronto Star'', 13 January 2004, A03.</ref>  He was subsequently appointed as the Conservative Party's Ontario co-chair for the [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004 federal election]].<ref>Robert Benzie and Susan Delacourt, "Tories must sustain their drive, Harper says", ''Toronto Star'', 6 June 2004, A08.</ref>  There were rumours that Baird would leave provincial politics to contest the 2004 election, but this did not happen.<ref>"John Baird has decided not to go federal", ''Broadcast News'', 10 February 2004, 07:42 report.</ref>  In 2005, he resigned his provincial seat to campaign federally for the Conservative Party.

Baird won a contested nomination battle for [[Ottawa West—Nepean]] Conservative nomination on May 5, 2005, defeating challengers Ed Mahfouz, [[Margret Kopala]] and Ade Olumide.  [[John Pacheco]], a leader in the [[social conservative]] movement against [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|same-sex marriage]], had also sought the nomination but was disqualified due to past comments he had made alleging that [[homosexual]] practices posed a health risk.<ref>[http://www.lifesite.net/ldn/2005/apr/05042911.html "Conservative Party Rejects Organizer of Huge Ottawa Marriage March As Potential Candidate", Lifesite news, 29 April 2005.]</ref> Pacheco later campaigned in the election as an "Independent conservative", with the specific intent of being a [[spoiler]] against Baird.  He argued that if his campaign caused Baird to lose, the Conservatives would "get the message that social conservatives are serious about their politics."<ref>[[Juliet O'Neill]], "Social conservative runs as independent; hopes to spoil Baird's bid", ''Ottawa Citizen'', 30 December 2005, A6. [http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_marb58.htm  2005-DEC-24: Election campaigning ceases over Christmas], Religious Tolerance.</ref>  Baird chose to ignore Pacheco entirely in at least one all-candidates debate.<ref>Juliet O'Neill, "Baird's health-care stance draws fire in Ottawa West-Nepean", ''Ottawa Citizen'', 14 January 2006, A5.</ref>  

Baird was elected, defeating Liberal candidate [[Lee Farnworth]] by about 5,000 votes.  The ''Ottawa Citizen'' endorsed Baird in this campaign, and argued that his political judgement had improved considerably since his tenure as a Harris cabinet minister.<ref>"Baird is the clear choice", ''Ottawa Citizen'', 17 January 2006, B4.</ref>  In December 2006, Baird was one of thirteen Conservative MPs who voted against reopening the national debate on same-sex marriage.<ref>Janice Tibbetts, "Same-sex debate put to rest: PM", ''National Post'', 8 December 2006, A1.</ref>

Baird has played an aggressive role in [[Question Period]] since his appointment to cabinet, leading MP [[Garth Turner]] to describe him as Stephen Harper's "[[Canadian House of Commons|Commons]] pit bull".<ref>Julie Smyth, "MP's camera goes where media can't", ''National Post'', 17 June 2006, A8.</ref>  [[Green Party of Canada|Green Party]] leader [[Elizabeth May]] has said, "I've been really offended by John Baird in the House. I've felt he discredits the institution. He doesn't wait for a question to come to him before he starts yelling."<ref>Chris Cobb, "The politics of green", ''Ottawa Citizen'', 28 January 2007, A7.</ref>

===President of the Treasury Board===

Baird was appointed President of the Treasury Board on February 6, 2006, a position that places him in charge of the federal public service.  Following his appointment, Baird said that one of his priorities would be to prevent government jobs from being relocated from Ottawa to other regions for political purposes.<ref>Mohammad Adam, "PS jobs will stay in Ottawa, Baird vows", ''Ottawa Citizen'', 8 February 2006, A1.</ref>  He also indicated that his government was not planning to introduce job cuts, or initiate a radical reduction in the size of government.<ref>Kathryn May, "No cuts coming, Baird assures PS", ''Ottawa Citizen'', 7 February 2006, A4.</ref>

In June 2006, Baird announced the creation of a three-member panel to advise the federal government on grant and contribution programs and accountability issues.  One of the members was [[Frances Lankin]], a former [[New Democratic Party of Ontario]] cabinet minister.<ref>"Independent blue-ribbon panel to advise on grant and contribution programs" [press release], ''Canada NewsWire'', 6 June 2005, 04:15.</ref>

====Accountability Act====

Baird introduced the Conservative government's first piece of legislation in April 2006.  Known as the "Accountability Act", the bill includes 317 sections and promises significant reform to the structure of Canadian politics and government.  Prime Minister Harper says that it will "put an end to the influence of money" in the Canadian government.  The Accountability Act restricts the ability of former politicians and bureaucrats to become lobbyists, provides protection to whistle-blowers in the civil service, and gives the [[Auditor General of Canada]] new powers of oversight.  It also limits individual donations to political parties and candidates to $1,000 per year (down from $5,200), creates nine new or revised positions to oversee the activities of public officials, and places crown corporations such as the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] under access-to-information legislation.<ref>Allan Woods, "No more 'entitlements': PM", ''National Post'', 12 April 2006, A1.</ref>

Opposition MPs complained that several recommendations for access-to-information reform were left out of the bill, and were instead sent to committee for further review.  [[New Democratic Party]] MP [[Pat Martin]] initially suggested that this deferral could delay meaningful reform for the forseeable future.<ref>Kathryn May, "Tories back away from key plank in ethics bill", ''Ottawa Citizen'', 5 April 2006, A1; Jim Bronskill, "Government has second thoughts about access-to-information reforms", ''Canadian Press'', 11 April 2006, 16:39 report; John Ivison, "Reforms fall short of tory pledge", ''National Post'', 12 April 2006, A4.</ref>  Martin later made a deal with Baird to give the bill an easy passage through committee, in return for the Conservatives accepting some NDP amendments.<ref>Bill Curry, "A handshake and a dance tame critic of ethics bill", ''Globe and Mail'', 19 June 2006, A4.</ref>

Information Commissioner [[John Reid (Canadian politician)|John Reid]] has criticized the new proposed powers for his department under the legislation, arguing that they will create unnecessary bureaucracy.<ref>Kathryn May, "Watchdog blasts Tory reforms", ''Edmonton Journal'', 10 April 2006, A6.</ref>  Shortly after the Accountability Act was introduced to parliament, Reid issued an emergency report saying that the legislation would "increase the government's ability to cover up wrongdoing, shield itself from embarrassment and control the flow of information to Canadians".  He added that no government had ever put forward "a more retrograde and dangerous" set of proposals for dealing with access to information laws.  Baird described Reid's criticisms as "excessive", saying that most of the commissioner's specific concerns were minor in nature.<ref>"Commissioner slams Harper for about-face on info access reform", ''Canadian Press'', 28 April 2006, 13:30 report.</ref>  Representatives of Canada's business community also expressed concern about changes to disclosure laws, arguing that their commercial secrets could be exposed to competitors.<ref>Steven Chase, "Tories won't change course on lobbying rules", ''Globe and Mail'', 14 June 2006, B4.</ref>  

The bill passed the House of Commons on division in June 2006.  The [[Canadian Senate]] approved it in December 2006 with several amendments, and sent it back to the Commons for further consideration.  The amended act was approved by the Commons without debate on 8 December,<ref>"Amended accountability act unanimously waived through Commons without vote", ''Canadian Press'', 8 December 2006, 14:40.</ref> and was signed into law four days later.

Shortly after the bill first passed the Commons, Baird acknowledged that the Conservatives may have unintentionally broken political financing laws by failing to report convention fees collected in 2005.  He told a Senate committee that $1.7 million was left unreported, and that he did not realize it was an issue at the time.<ref>Joan Bryden, "Tories may have taken in close to $2 million in illegal contributions", ''Canadian Press'', 28 June 2006, 21:00 report.</ref>  The matter is currently under review by the Chief Electoral Officer.  The Conservatives quietly tabled an amendment to the Accountability Act in November 2006, stipulating that convention fees will not be counted as political contributions.<ref>"Tories to amend law they're accused of breaking", ''Kitchener-Waterloo Record'', 18 November 2006, A3.</ref>

====Program cuts====

In May 2006, Baird was asked to find $1 billion in cuts for 2006 and 2007.<ref>Steven Chase, "Budget makes little headway toward reining in spending", ''Globe and Mail'', 3 May 2006, A18.</ref>  On September 25, on the same day that the government announced a $13.2 billion surplus, Baird announced cuts to sixty-six federal programs, including Status of Women, medicinal marijuana research, Canadian museums, adult literacy, youth employment and social development, and the British Columbia pine beetle program.  One of the most controversial cuts was to the federal Court Challenges Program, which provides funding for Canadians to pursue rights cases in the Canadian court system.<ref>Steven Chase, "Ottawa's $2-billion hit list", ''Globe and Mail'', 26 September 2006, A1; Eric Beauchesne, "Flush feds 'trim fat': $13.2-billion surplus", ''Montreal Gazette'', 26 September 2006, A1; Carol Goar, "A slightly less 'Just Society'" [editorial], ''Toronto Star'', 2 October 2006, A18.</ref>  Critics charged that the cuts were ideological in nature, and will adversely affect the most vulnerable Canadians.  Baird has argued that government funding will be redirected in a way that "reflects the priorities of working families" and that he "just [didn't] think it made sense for the government to subsidize lawyers to challenge the government's own laws in court".<ref>Les Whittington and Bruce Campion-Smith, "Tories cut $1B despite surplus", ''Toronto Star'', 26 September 2006, A1; [http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060926/spending_cuts_060926/20060926?hub=Canada "Liberal programs axed under Tory spending cuts"], ''CTV News'', September 26, 2006, accessed on September 26, 2006; John Sossin, "An axe that harms democracy" [opinion], ''Toronto Star'', 28 September 2006, A23.</ref>  In justifying cuts to adult literacy programs, Baird referenced his government's support for youth literacy and said, "We've got to fix the ground level problem and not be trying to do repair work after the fact".<ref>Carol Goar, "Tories misread literacy needs", ''Toronto Star'', 16 October 2006, A18.</ref>

====2006 Ottawa municipal election====

In early October 2006, Baird's department reviewed a promised $200 million grant to the City of Ottawa's [[O-Train|light-rail expansion]] project.  Baird indicated that the government would keep the funding at least until the November election, but added that the Council elected in November will have the final say on the issue.<ref>[http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/city/story.html?id=156d1e33-13cf-46a5-b428-97d42da01209, James Gordon, The Ottawa Citizen, "Chiarelli misled council on rail deal, Munter says"], ''Ottawa Citizen'', October 11, 2006</ref>  He also leaked details of the city's contact with the German firm [[Siemens]].<ref>Lawrence Martin, "Ottawa derailed by politics?", ''Globe and Mail'', 11 January 2007, A19.</ref>  As a result, the rail program became a focal issue in the [[Ottawa municipal election, 2006|2006 Ottawa mayoral election]] and Baird's opponents accused him of trying to influence the outcome.<ref>Mark Sutcliffe, "Baird becomes focus of race without being a candidate", ''Ottawa Citizen'', 8 October 2006, A9; Jake Rupert, "'I don't like being lied to,' Baird says", ''Ottawa Citizen'', 12 October 2006, C1.</ref>  Baird and Ottawa Mayor [[Bob Chiarelli]] accused one another of lying about details of the project<ref>Patrick Dare, "Chiarelli slams Baird for 'lying to the public'", ''Ottawa Citizen'', 13 October 2006, F1.</ref>, and Liberal MP [[Navdeep Bains]] asked the Federal Ethics Commissioner to investigate Baird's decision to release details of the private contract. <ref>[http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/city/story.html?id=073b3147-f242-4aae-9519-5c0d1fe84489&k=87744 Chris Lackner & James Gordon, The Ottawa Citizen, "Liberal MPs want Baird  investigated by ethics czar"], ''Ottawa Citizen'' October 19, 2006; Chris Lackner and James Gordon, "Liberal MPs want Baird investigated by ethics czar", ''Ottawa Citizen'', 19 October 2006, C1.</ref>  Chiarelli was defeated in the election, and the light-rail expansion was stopped by the new council.<ref>Jake Rupert, "Council kills light rail, blames federal government", ''Ottawa Citizen'', 15 December 2006, A1.</ref>  

An ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'' report in January 2007 revealed that federal officials had not posed any objections to the light-rail project before Baird's intervention, and suggested that his involvement was political in nature.<ref>Mohammed Adam, "Baird's rail ruling was political, documents show", ''Ottawa Citizen'', 6 January 2007, A1.  See also Ken Gray, "Mr. Baird's municipal preoccupation", ''Ottawa Citizen'', 26 January 2007, F4.</ref>  [[Green Party of Canada|Green Party]] leader [[Elizabeth May]] has speculated that Ottawa may have been deprived of light-rail service because of an apparent "personal vendetta" from Baird against Chiarelli.  Baird has denied this charge, saying that his intervention was not political.<ref>Lawrence Martin, "Ottawa derailed by politics?", ''Globe and Mail'', 11 January 2007, A19.</ref>

Chiarelli has indicated that he may seek the Liberal nomination against Baird for the next federal election.<ref>Andrew Mayeda, "Former mayor Eyeing Payback in Baird's riding", ''National Post'', 13 January 2007, A6.</ref>

====Other responsibilities====

Baird holds ministerial responsibilities for the Toronto Harbourfront Centre and the Toronto Waterfront Revitalization Corporation.<ref>Jennifer Lewington, "How to make friends and influence Ottawa", ''Globe and Mail'', 4 March 2006, M2.</ref>  He developed a working relationship with [[Mayor of Toronto|Toronto Mayor]] [[David Miller]] soon after his appointment, and was present for the announcement of a comprehensive new waterfront strategy in June 2006.  Ontario cabinet minister [[David Caplan]] has described Baird as a champion of waterfront renewal, and David Miller has described him as an ally of the city.<ref>Kerry Gillespie, "Ottawa backs waterfront renewal", ''Toronto Star'', 28 March 2006, B1; Richard Brennan, "Wooing hearts... and votes", ''Toronto Star'', 28 May 2006, A6; </ref>

Baird spent [[Christmas]] 2006 meeting with Canadian soldiers in [[Afghanistan]].<ref>Brian Hutchinson, "Battle Expected To Intensify", ''National Post'', 26 December 2006, A1.</ref>

===Environment Minister===

On January 4, 2007, Baird was appointed as [[Minister of the Environment (Canada)|Environment Minister]] in a [[cabinet shuffle]], replacing previous Minister [[Rona Ambrose]].  In making the appointment, Prime Minister Stephen Harper acknowledged that his government needed to do more to make the environment a priority.<ref>Andrew Mayeda and Mike Blanchfield, "Harper shuffles the deck", ''Ottawa Citizen'', 5 January 2007, A1.</ref>  Some commentators have remarked favourably on Baird's appointment, describing him as a strong communicator and negotiator.<ref>L. Ian Macdonald, "Good fix, good fit: Harper's shuffle could solve his environmental image problem", ''Montreal Gazette'', 6 January 2007, B7.</ref>  Others have taken a more critical view.  [[Andrew Coyne]] described Baird as "the man sent to kill the issue", arguing that Baird's appointment was meant to neutralize the environment as an election issue rather than to initiate any meaningful reforms.<ref>Andrew Coyne, "The man sent to kill the issue: Baird posting is all about appearances", ''National Post'', 5 January 2007, A1.</ref>

Baird met with NDP leader [[Jack Layton]] in [[Vancouver]] shortly after his appointment.  The NDP has identified climate change and the environment as key priorities to be addressed by parliament.  Layton has said that the Conservatives will need to address environmental concerns in their 2007 budget to receive support from the NDP.<ref>Terri Theodore, "NDP sets climate change and middle-class finances as priorities", ''Canadian Press'', 10 January 2007, 18:40; Gloria Galloway, "Layton draws a line in the sand on climate", ''Globe and Mail'', 11 January 2007, A7.</ref>  Baird also met with renowned Canadian environmentalist [[David Suzuki]] following his appointment.  Suzuki said he was encouraged by Baird's approach, but sceptical of the government's environmental plans.<ref>"Get moving on climate change, Suzuki urges", ''Winnipeg Free Press'', 12 January 2007, A13.</ref>

Shortly after his appointment, Baird, [[Stephen Harper]] [[Minister of Natural Resources (Canada)|Natural Resources]] Minister [[Gary Lunn]] announced $1.5 billion for clean-energy initiatives over the next decade.  Baird and Lunn also announced a $230 million program for clean energy technology.  Critics have charged that these programs are similar to initiatives introduced by the former Liberal government, and cancelled by the Conservatives after they assumed office in 2006.<ref>Allan Woods, "Tories push $1.5B in green initiatives", ''Toronto Star'', 20 January 2007, A4.</ref>  New Liberal leader [[Stéphane Dion]] has argued that the Conservative Party's strategy is too strongly focused on [[nuclear energy]].<ref>Alex Dobrota, "Ministers announce clean-energy research", ''Globe and Mail'', 18 January 2007, A4.</ref>

Baird has also indicated that the federal government will contribute $30 million to conserve the [[Great Bear Rainforest]] in [[British Columbia]].<ref>"Conservatives give $30M to protect B.C. rainforest", ''Ottawa Citizen'', 22 January 2007, A4.</ref>

In late January 2007, Baird's spokesman indicated that the department could take several weeks or months before introducing mandatory targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions.  His predecessor, [[Rona Ambrose]], had promised that the targets would be released in mid-January.<ref>"Emissions-cutting target months away", ''Guelph Mercury'', 27 January 2007, A6.</ref>
