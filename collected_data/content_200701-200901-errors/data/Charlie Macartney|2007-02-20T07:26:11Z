'''Charles Macartney''' (born [[June 27]], [[1886]], [[Maitland, New South Wales]]; died [[September 9]], [[1958]], [[Little Bay, New South Wales|Little Bay]], [[Sydney, New South Wales]]) was an [[Australian]] [[cricketer]] who played in 35 [[Test cricket|Tests]] between [[1907]] and [[1926]].  He was known as ''The Governor-General''.

In his first tour in [[1909]], he played at number 8 as a slow left arm bowler, with a reputation as an all-rounder with particularly good fielding skills.  Gradually, his extraordinary reflexes were recognised and in the 1912 Triangular Tournament he opened the batting with [[Warren Bardsley]] scoring 2,207 runs during the tour.

In [[1921]] against [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]] at [[Trent Bridge]] he made 345 in under four hours.

He was a [[Wisden Cricketer of the Year]] recipient in [[1922]].

In domestic first-class cricket, Macartney mostly played for [[New South Wales Blues|New South Wales]]; in 1909-10, he represented the New Zealand domestic side [[Otago Volts|Otago]].
