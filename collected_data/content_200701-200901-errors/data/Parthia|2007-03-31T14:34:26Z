'''Parthia'''<ref>''Parthia'' derives from [[Latin]] ''Parthia'', from [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]] ''Parthava-'', a dialectical variant of the stem ''Parsa-'', from which [[Persia]] derives. ''Ashkanian'' appears to have come from the Sassanian chronicles, from which they entered in [[Ferdowsi]]'s epic poem ''[[Shahnama]]''.</ref> ([[Persian language|Middle Persian]]: '''اشکانیان Ashkâniân''') was a civilization situated in the northeast of modern Iran, but at its height covering all of [[Iran]] proper, as well as regions of the modern countries of [[Armenia]], [[Iraq]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], eastern [[Turkey]], eastern [[Syria]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Pakistan]], [[Kuwait]], the [[Persian Gulf]] coast of [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Bahrain]], [[Qatar]], and [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]]. 

Parthia was led by the [[Arsacid dynasty]], who reunited and ruled over the [[Iran]]ian plateau, taking over the eastern provinces of the  [[Hellenic Greece|Greek]] [[Seleucid Empire]], beginning in the late [[3rd century BC]], and intermittently controlled [[Mesopotamia]] between ca 150 BC and 224 [[AD]]. It was the third native dynasty of ancient Iran (after the [[Medes|Median]] and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] dynasties). Parthia (mostly due to their invention of [[heavy cavalry]]) was the arch-enemy of the [[Roman Empire]] in the east; and it limited Rome's expansion beyond [[Cappadocia]] (eastern [[Anatolia]]). 

After the [[Scythian]]-[[Parni]] [[nomads]] ([[Assyrians]] called them Ashkuz) had settled in Parthia and had built a small independent kingdom, they rose to power under king [[Mithridates I of Parthia|Mithridates the Great]] (171&ndash;138 BC). Later, at the height of their power, Parthian influence reached as far as [[Ubar]] in [[Arabia]], the nexus of the [[frankincense]] [[trade route]], where Parthian-inspired ceramics have been found.  The power of the early Parthian empire seems to have been overestimated by some ancient historians, who could not clearly separate the powerful later empire from its more humble obscure origins. The end of this long-lived empire came in 224 AD, when the empire was loosely organized and the last king was defeated by one of the empire's vassals, the Persians of the [[Sassanid]] dynasty.

Little is known of the Parthians; not much of their own literature has survived.  Consequently Parthian history is largely derived from foreign histories, controlled by the evidence of  [[numismatics|coins]] and [[epigraphy|inscriptions]]; even their own name for themselves is debatable due to a lack of domestic records. Several Greek authors, of whom we have fragments, including [[Apollodorus of Artemita]] and [[Isidore of Charax]], wrote under Parthian rule. Their power was based on a combination of the guerilla warfare of a mounted nomadic tribe, with organisational skills sufficient to build and administer a vast empire - even though it never matched in power the Persian empires that preceded and followed it. Vassal kingdoms seem to have made up a large part of their territory (see [[Tigranes II of Armenia|Tigranes II]] of [[History of Armenia|Armenia]]), and [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] cities enjoyed a certain autonomy; their craftsmen received employment by some Parthians.

[[Strabo]] considered Parthians to be [[Carduchi]], i.e., the inhabitants of Curdistan.<ref>[http://gutenkarte.org/place/731/14977 History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire], Chapter 21.</ref>

==Parthia as a satrapy==
Parthia originally designated a territory southeast of the [[Caspian sea]]. It was a satrapy of the [[Achaemenid Empire]], which was conquered by [[Alexander the Great]] circa 330 BCE. Following Alexander's death, the government of Parthia was given to [[Nicanor (satrap)|Nicanor]], at the [[Partition of Babylon]] in 323 BCE. At the [[Partition of Triparadisus]] in 320 BCE, Parthia was given to [[Philip (satrap)|Philip]]. Philip was then succeeded by [[Peithon]]. From 311 BCE Parthia then became a part of the [[Seleucid empire]], being ruled by various [[satrap]]s under a Seleucid king. 

[[Image:AndragorasBMC.jpg|thumb|300px|Coin of Andragoras, the last Seleucid satrap of Parthia. He proclaimed independence around 250 BCE.]] 
[[Andragoras (3rd century BC)|Andragoras]] (?-238 BCE) was the last [[Seleucid]] [[satrap]] of the province of "Partahia", under the Seleucid rulers [[Antiochus I Soter]] and [[Antiochus II Theos]] ([[Junianus Justinus|Justin]], xli. 4). Andragoras tried to wrestle independence from the Seleucid Empire, at a time when the Seleucid were embroiled in conflict with [[Ptolemaic]] Egypt. In defiance, he issued coins in which he wears the royal diadem as well as his name (Will: I, 1966). Andragoras was a neighbour, a contemporary, and probably an ally of [[Diodotus I]] in [[Bactria]], who also fought the [[Seleucids]] for independence around the same time, giving rise to the [[Greco-Bactrian kingdom]].

==The Parthian Empire==

[[Image:Coin of Arsaces I of Parthia.jpg|thumb|300px|Coin of Arsaces I. The reverse shows a seated archer carrying a bow. A Greek inscription on the right reads ΑΡΣΑΚ[ΟΥ] (from the outside). The incription below the bow is in [[Aramaic]].]]
The tribe of the [[Parni]], a [[nomad]]ic people of [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] origin, who originally spoke an [[Eastern Iranian]] language and later known as the Parthians, entered the [[Iranian plateau]] from [[Central Asia]]. They were consummate horsemen, known for the '[[Parthian shot]]': turning backwards at full gallop to loose an arrow directly to the rear. Initially, ca. 238 BCE, their king named [[Arsaces I of Parthia|Arsaces]] (Ashk) toppled [[Andragoras (3rd century BC)|Andragoras]] and established his [[Arsacid dynasty|dynasty's]] independence from [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] rule in remote areas of northern Iran in what is today known as Turkmenistan. 

:"He (Arsaces) was used to a life of pillage and theft, when he heard about the defeat of [[Seleucus II Callinicus|Seleucus]] against the [[Gaul]]s. Relieved from his fear of the king, he attacked the Parthians with a band of thieves, vanquished their prefect Andragoras, and, after having killed him took the power over the nation" [http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/texte41.html Justin, xli. 4].

The descendants of Arsaces ruled until [[Antiochus III the Great]] invaded Parthia in [[209 BC]], occupied the capital [[Hecatompylus]] and pushed forward into [[Hyrcania]]. The Parthian king  [[Arsaces II of Parthia|Arsaces II]] apparently successfully sued for peace, and Parthia recognized Seleucid authority. Antiochus III had so well secured Parthia that he moved further east into [[Bactria]], where he fought the [[Greco-Bactrian]] king [[Euthydemus I]] for three years, and then went into [[India]].

It was not until the 2nd century BC that the Parthians were able to profit from the continuing erosion of the Seleucid Empire, gradually capturing all its territories east of Syria. Once the Parthians had gained [[Herat]], the movement of trade along the [[Silk Road]] to China was effectively choked off and the [[Alexander the Great|post-Alexandrian]] Hellenistic [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]] was doomed.

The Seleucid monarchs attempted to "hold the line" against the Parthian expansion; [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] spent his last years on a campaign against the newly emerging Iranian states. After his death in 164 BC, the Parthians took advantage of the ensuing dynastic squabbles to make even greater gains. 

[[Image: MithradatesI.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Coin of [[Mithridates I of Parthia|Mithridates I]] (ruled 171&ndash;138 BC) from the mint at [[Seleucia on the Tigris]]. The reverse shows a naked [[Heracles]] holding a cup, lion's skin and club. The [[Greek language|Greek]] inscription reads ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΣ ΜΕΓΑΛΟΥ ΑΡΣΑΚΟΥ ΦΙΛΕΛΛΗΝΟΣ (great king Arsaces, friend of the [[Greece|Greeks]]). The date ΓΟΡ is the year 173 of the [[Seleucid dynasty|Seleucid era]], corresponding to 140&ndash;139 BC.]]
In 139 BC, the Parthian king [[Mithridates I of Parthia|Mithridates I]] captured the Seleucid monarch [[Demetrius II of Syria|Demetrius II Nicator]], holding him captive for ten years while his troops overwhelmed [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Medes|Media]].

By 129 BC the Parthians were in control of all the lands right to the [[Tigris River|Tigris]], and established their winter encampment on its banks at [[Ctesiphon]], downstream from modern [[Baghdad]]. Ctesiphon was then a small suburb directly across the river from [[Seleucia on the Tigris]], the most Hellenistic city of western Asia. Because of their need of the wealth and trade provided by Seleucia, the Parthian armies limited their incursions to harassment, allowing the city to preserve its independence. In the heat of the Mesopotamian summer, the Parthian army would withdraw to the ancient Persian capitals of [[Susa]] and [[Ecbatana]] (modern [[Hamadan]]).

From around 130 BCE, the Parthians suffered numerous incursions by [[Scythian]] nomads (also called the [[Tocharian]]s from [[Bactria]], possibly the [[Yuezhi]]), in which kings [[Phraates II of Parthia|Phraates II]] and [[Artabanus I of Parthia|Artabanus I]] were successively killed. Scythians again invaded Parthia around 90 BCE, putting king [[Sanatruces of Parthia|Sanatruces]] on the Parthian throne.

== Government == 
[[Image:PhartianFormalHeaddress.gif|thumb|250px|Different kinds of Parthian formal headdress used both between people and royal meetings. Their style is a mix of Persian and Greek clothing style. An Armenian tiara is depicted on the lower right corner.]]
After the conquest of Media, [[Assyria]], [[Babylonia]] and [[Elam]], the Parthians had to organize their empire. The former elites of these countries were Greek, and the new rulers had to adapt to their customs if they wanted their rule to last. As a result, the cities retained their ancient rights and civil administrations remained more or less undisturbed. An interesting detail is coinage: legends were written in the Greek alphabet, a practice that continued until the 2nd century AD, when local knowledge of the language was in decline and few people knew how to read or write the Greek alphabet. 

Another source of inspiration was the [[Achaemenid dynasty]] that had once ruled the [[Persian Empire]]. Courtiers spoke Persian and used the [[Pahlavi script]]; the royal court traveled from capital to capital, and the [[Arsacid]] kings styled themselves "king of kings". It was an apt title, as in addition to his own kingdom the Parthian monarch was the overlord of some  eighteen vassal kings, such as the rulers of the city state [[Hatra]], the kingdom of [[Characene]] and the ancient kingdom of [[Armenia]].

[[Image:SurenaImage.jpg|left|200px|thumb|The ''Parthian Prince'', thought to be [[Surena]] the victor of the [[Battle of Carrhae]], found in [[Khuzestan]] ca. 100 AD, is kept at The [[National Museum of Iran]], [[Tehran]].]]
The empire was, overall, not very centralized. There were several languages, many peoples, and a number of different economic systems.  The loose ties between the separate parts of the empire were a key to its survival. In the 2nd century AD, the most important capital, Ctesiphon, was captured no less than three times by the Romans (in 116, 165 and 198 AD), but the empire survived because there were other centers of power. On the other hand, the fact that the empire was a mere conglomeratation of kingdoms, provinces and city-states did at times seriously weaken the Parthian state. This was a major factor in the halt of the Parthian expansion after the conquests of Mesopotamia and [[Persian Empire|Persia]].

Local potentates played important roles, and the king had to respect their privileges. Several noble families had votes in the Royal council; the [[Suren-Pahlav Clan]] had the right to crown the Parthian king, and every aristocrat was allowed and expected to retain an army of his own. When the throne was occupied by a weak ruler, divisions among the nobility became dangerous.

The constituent parts of the empire were surprisingly independent. For example, they were allowed to strike their own coins, a privilege which in antiquity was very rare. As long as the local elite paid tribute to the Parthian king, there was little interference. The system worked well: towns like Ctesiphon, Seleucia, Ecbatana, [[Rhagae]], [[Hecatompylos]], [[Nisa (village)|Nisâ]], and Susa flourished.

Tribute was one source of royal income; another was tolls. Parthia controlled the Silk Road, the trade route between the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and China.

==Parthian language==
{{mainarticle|Parthian language}}
Parthian is a now-extinct ancient Northwestern [[Iranian languages|Iranian language]] that originated in [[Parthia]] (a region in north-east of modern [[Iran]] and the [[Greater Khorasan]], including southern part of what is today known as [[Turkmenistan]]) and was the official language of the Parthian Empire under the [[Arsacid Dynasty]] (248 BC - 224 AD).

==Contact with China==
[[Image:Zhang Qian.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The 138-126 BC travels of [[Zhang Qian]] to the West, [[Mogao Caves]], 618-712 AD [[mural]].]]
The Chinese explorer [[Zhang Qian]], who visited the neighbouring countries of [[Bactria]] and [[Sogdiana]] in 126 BC, made the first known Chinese report on Parthia. In his accounts Parthia is named "Ānxī" (Chinese: 安息), a transliteration of "[[Arsacid]]", the name of the Parthian dynasty. Zhang Qian clearly identifies Parthia as an advanced urban civilization, which he equates to those of [[Dayuan]] (in [[Ferghana]]) and [[Daxia]] (in Bactria). 

:"Anxi is situated several thousand ''[[Li (Chinese unit)|li]]'' west of the region of the Great [[Yuezhi]] (in [[Transoxonia]]). The people are settled on the land, cultivating the fields and growing rice and wheat. They also make wine out of grapes. They have walled cities like the people of [[Dayuan]] ([[Ferghana]]), the region contains several hundred cities of various sizes. The coins of the country are made of silver and bear the face of the king. When the king dies, the currency is immediately changed and new coins issued with the face of his successor. The people keep records by writing on horizontal strips of leather. To the west lies [[Tiaozhi]] (Mesopotamia) and to the north Yancai and Lixuan ([[Hyrcania]])." ([[Shiji]], 123, Zhang Qian quote, trans. Burton Watson).

Following Zhang Qian's embassy and report, commercial relations between China, Central Asia, and Parthia flourished, as many Chinese missions were sent throughout the 1st century BC: "The largest of these embassies to foreign states numbered several hundred persons, while even the smaller parties included over 100 members... In the course of one year anywhere from five to six to over ten parties would be sent out." (Shiji, trans. Burton Watson).

The Parthians were apparently very intent on maintaining good relations with China and also sent their own embassies, starting around 110 BC: "When the [[Han dynasty|Han]] envoy first visited the kingdom of Anxi (Parthia), the king of Anxi dispatched a party of 20,000 horsemen to meet them on the eastern border of the kingdom... When the Han envoys set out again to return to China, the king of Anxi dispatched envoys of his own to accompany them... The emperor was delighted at this." (Shiji, 123, trans. Burton Watson).

In [[97]] the Chinese general [[Ban Chao]] went as far west as the [[Caspian Sea]] with 70,000 men and established direct military contacts with the Parthian Empire.

Parthians also played a role in the [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism]] from Central Asia to China. [[An Shih Kao]], a Parthian nobleman and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] missionary, went to the Chinese capital [[Luoyang]] in [[148]] where he established temples and became the first man to translate Buddhist scriptures into [[Chinese language|Chinese]].

==Conflicts with Rome==
{{main|Roman relations with the Parthians and Sassanians}}
[[Image: ParthianWarrior.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Reproduction of a Parthian archer as depicted on [[Trajan's Column]].]]
[[Image:ParthianHorseman.jpg|thumb|200px|Parthian horseman. [[Palazzo Madama, Turin|Palazzo Madama]], [[Turin]], [[Italy]].]]
In 53 BC, the Roman general [[Crassus]] invaded Parthia, but was defeated at the [[Battle of Carrhae]] by a Parthian commander called [[Surena]] in the Greek and Latin sources, most likely a member of the [[Suren-Pahlav Clan]]. This was the beginning of a series of wars that were to last for almost three centuries.

The Parthian armies included two types of [[cavalry]]: the heavily-armed and armoured [[cataphract]]s and lightly armed but highly-mobile [[Horse archer|mounted archers]]. For the Romans, who relied on heavy [[infantry]], the Parthians were too hard to defeat, as both types of cavalry were much faster and more mobile than foot soldiers. On the other hand, the Parthians found it difficult to occupy conquered areas as they were unskilled in [[siege warfare]].  Because of these weaknesses, neither the Romans nor the Parthians were able to completely defeat each other.

In the years following the battle of Carrhae the Romans were divided in [[civil war]] between the adherents of [[Pompey]] and those of [[Julius Caesar]] and hence unable to campaign against Parthia.  Although Caesar was eventually victorious against Pompey and was planning a campaign against Parthia, his subsequent murder led to another civil war. The Roman general [[Quintus Labienus]], who had supported Caesar's murderers and feared reprisals from his heirs, [[Mark Antony]] and [[Augustus|Octavian]] (later [[Augustus]]), sided with the Parthians and eventually became the best general of king [[Pacorus I of Parthia|Pacorus I]]. In 41 BC Parthia, led by Labienus, invaded Syria, [[Cilicia]], and [[Caria]] and attacked [[Phrygia]] in [[Asia Minor]]. A second army intervened in [[Judaea]] and captured its king [[Hyrcanus]] II. The spoils were immense, and put to good use: King [[Phraates IV of Parthia|Phraates IV]] invested them in building up [[Ctesiphon]].

In 39 BC, Antony retaliated, sending out the old warhorse general [[Publius Ventidius Bassus]] and several of Caesar's crack, veteran legions to secure the conquered territories. The Parthian King Pacorus was killed along with Labienus, and the [[Euphrates]] again became the border between the two nations. Hoping to further avenge the death of Crassus, Antony invaded Mesopotamia in 36 BC with the Legion VI Ferrata and other units. Having cavalry in support, Antony reached Armenia but ceased his advance as civil war again broke out in Rome.

Antony's campaign was followed by a break in the fighting between the two empires as Rome was again embroiled in civil war.  When Octavian defeated Mark Antony, he ignored the Parthians, being more interested in the west. His son-in-law and future successor [[Tiberius]] negotiated a peace treaty with Phraates (20 BC).

[[Image:ParthianCataphract.JPG|thumb|220px|Parthian [[cataphract]] fighting a lion. [[British Museum]].]]
At the same time, around the year 1, the Parthians became interested in the valley of the [[Indus river|Indus]], where they began conquering the petty kingdoms of [[Gandhara]]. One of the Parthian leaders was [[Gondophares]], king of [[Taxila]]; according to an old and widespread [[Christianity|Christian]] tradition, he was baptized by the apostle [[Thomas (apostle)|Thomas]]. While it may sound far-fetched, the story is not altogether impossible: adherents of several religions lived together in Gandara and the [[Punjab region|Punjab]], and there may have been an audience for a representative of a new [[Judaism|Jewish]] sect.

War broke out again between Rome and Parthia in the 60s. Armenia had become a Roman vassal kingdom, but the Parthian king [[Vologases I of Parthia|Vologases I]] appointed a new Armenian ruler. This was too much for the Romans, and their commander [[Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo]] invaded Armenia. The result was that the Armenian king received his crown again in Rome from the emperor [[Nero]]. A compromise was worked out between the two empires: in the future, the king of Armenia was to be a Parthian prince, but his appointment required approval from the Romans.

==Expansion to India==

{{Main article|Indo-Parthian Kingdom}}
[[Image: Gondophares.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Coin of [[Gondophares]] (20-50), first and greatest king of the [[Indo-Parthian Kingdom]].]]
Also during the 1st century BC, the Parthians started to make inroads into eastern territories that had been occupied by the [[Indo-Scythians]] and the [[Yuezhi]]. The Parthians gained control of parts of [[Bactria]] and extensive [[South Asian]] territories in modern day [[Pakistan]], after defeating local rulers such as the [[Kushan Empire]] ruler [[Kujula Kadphises]], in the [[Gandhara]] region. 

The ruins of the ancient port city of [[Siraf]] are in the process of excavation, and  its historical importance  to ancient trade is only now being realized. Discovered there in  archaeological excavations are ivory objects from east [[Africa]], pieces of stone from [[India]], and [[lapis]] from [[Afghanistan]]. Sirif dates back to the Parthian era.<ref>{{cite web

Around [[20|20 AD]], Gondophares, one of the Parthian conquerors, declared his independence from the Parthian empire and established the [[Indo-Parthian Kingdom]] in the conquered territories.

== Decline and fall ==

<!--LEAVE IMAGES IN A ROW TO AVOID CREATION OF BLANKS-->
The Armenian compromise served its purpose, but nothing in it covered the deposition of an Armenian king. After 110 AD, the Parthian king [[Vologases III of Parthia|Vologases III]] dethroned the Armenian ruler, and the Roman emperor [[Trajan]] decided to invade Parthia in retaliation. War broke out in 114 AD and the Parthians were severely beaten. The Romans conquered Armenia, and in the following year, Trajan marched to the south, where the Parthians were forced to evacuate their strongholds. In 116 AD, Trajan captured Ctesiphon, and established new provinces in Assyria and [[Babylonia]]. Later that year he took the Parthian capital, [[Susa]], deposed the Parthian King [[Osroes I]] and put [[Parthamaspates]] as a puppet ruler  on the throne.

Rebellions  soon broke out due to the continuing loyalty of the population to Parthia. At the same time, the [[Jewish diaspora|diasporic Jews]] revolted and Trajan was forced to send an army to suppress them. Trajan overcame these troubles, but his successor [[Hadrian]] gave up the territories (117 AD). 

Parthian weaknesses also contributed to the disaster. In the first century AD, the Parthian nobility had become more powerful due to concessions by the Parthian king granting them greater powers over the land and the peasantry.  Their power now rivaled the king's, while at the same time internal divisions in the [[Arsacid]] family had rendered them vulnerable.

[[Image:ParthianInChains.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Parthian prisoner in chains, led forward by a Roman, circa 200 Ad. [[Arch of Septimius Severus]], [[Rome]].]]
But the end was not near, yet. In 161 AD king [[Vologases IV of Parthia|Vologases IV]] declared war against the Romans and reconquered Armenia. The Roman counter-offensive was slow, but in 165 AD, Ctesiphon fell, and the Parthians were only saved by the outburst of a catastrophic epidemic (probably the [[measles]]) which temporarily crippled the two empires. The Roman emperors [[Lucius Verus]] and [[Marcus Aurelius]] added northern Mesopotamia to their realm (partly as a vassal-kingdom), but as it was never secure enough for them to [[demilitarization|demilitarize]] the region between the Euphrates and Tigris, it remained an expensive burden.

The deciding blow came thirty years later. King [[Vologases V of Parthia|Vologases V]] had tried to reconquer Mesopotamia during another Roman civil war (193 AD), but was repulsed when general [[Septimius Severus]] counter-attacked. Again, Ctesiphon was captured (198 AD), and large spoils were brought to Rome. According to a modern estimate, the gold and silver were sufficient to postpone a [[Europe]]an economic crisis for three or four decades, and the consequences of the looting for Parthia were dire.

Parthia, now impoverished and without any hope to recover the lost territories, was demoralized. The kings were forced to concede greater powers to the nobility, and the vassal kings began to waver in their allegiance. In 224 AD, the Persian vassal king [[Ardashir I|Ardašir]] revolted. Two years later, he took Ctesiphon, and this time it meant the end of Parthia, replaced by a third Persian Empire, ruled by the [[Sassanid dynasty]].
