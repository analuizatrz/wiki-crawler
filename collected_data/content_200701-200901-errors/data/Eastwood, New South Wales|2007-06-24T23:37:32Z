'''Eastwood''' is a large suburb in the north of [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. It is located around 15 kilometres north-west of the [[Central Business District]].

Originally thought to have been inhabited by the Wallumedegal [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] tribe, who lived in the area between the [[Lane Cove River|Lane Cove]] and [[Parramatta River|Parramatta]] Rivers, the area was first settled by Europeans shortly after the arrival of the [[First Fleet]] in 1788, from land grants to marines and N.S.W. Corps, and was named "Eastwood" by an early Irish free settler, William Rutledge. Today it is a large urban centre in the north of Sydney of over 14000 people, with  a large shopping area. Over the past few decades Eastwood has become increasingly multicultural and has a large Chinese and Korean community. Eastwood is best known as the place of where the [[Granny Smith]] Apple was first grown.

==Geography==
Eastwood is located at the edge of the [[Hornsby Plateau]], and its southern and western sides, the suburbs of [[Dundas Valley, New South Wales|Dundas Valley]] and [[Denistone, New South Wales|Denistone]], the land falls away down to the [[Cumberland Plain]]. To the north, Eastwood is bounded by the transport hub of [[Epping, New South Wales|Epping]] and to its east [[Marsfield, New South Wales|Marsfield]], with which Eastwood shares the same postcode (2122). The suburb is split between two local council areas, being located mostly within the [[City of Ryde]], and partially within the [[City of Parramatta]], so is split between the [[Lower North Shore (Sydney)|Lower North Shore]] and the [[Hills District (Sydney)|Hills District]] areas. 

The suburb is predominantly housing, but the main shopping area of Eastwood is centred between Rowe St and Rutledge St:
* By car:
** If travelling along Victoria Rd, turn onto Shaftsbury Rd. 
** If travelling along Epping Rd, turn onto Balaclava Rd, left into Blaxland Rd, right into First Ave/Rutledge St, and then right into Trelawney St.
** If travelling along Pennant Hills Rd, turn onto Marsden Rd, left into Terry Rd and then right into Shaftsbury.
* By train:
** Use [[CityRail|CityRail's]] [[Northern railway line, Sydney|Northern Line]] and get off at [[Eastwood railway station, Sydney|Eastwood Railway Station]], which is in between Epping and Denistone stations.
* By bus: Buses run from various major centres to an interchange the railway station, including the 545 Route from Parramatta and Chatswood, the 544 from Auburn and Macquarie University Via Denistone East and the X15/515 route to the City.

==History==
[[Image:Eastwoodbrickworks.JPG|right|250px|thumb|The old Eastwood Brickworks site, now being developed into a housing estate.]]
The area of Eastwood was originally granted between the years of 1790 and 1803. In 1835, William Rutledge purchase the area and gave it the name of Eastwood Estate. In 1863 Edward Terry purchased the estate. Upon Edward Terry's death in 1905, the estate was sub-divided into what is now the Eastwood village and area.
The name derives from the name of the Terry family residence, so called after [[Eastwood, Nottinghamshire]], [[England]].
Eastwood is home to the [[Granny Smith]] [[apple]] variety. This is celebrated each October with the ''[[Granny Smith Festival]]'' which attracts over 60,000 people each year.

The shopping area underwent a major upgrade in the early 1980s. Rowe St, which originally ran across the railway line through a [[level crossing]] was turned into a mall between The Avenue and West Parade, the level crossing removed, and a bridge built in First Avenue for crossing traffic. This bridge was to service the planned County of Cumberland Scheme "County Road" (linking Eastwood with [[Macquarie Park]]), a highly controversial road project in the local area[http://www.ozroads.com.au/NSW/Special/Unbuilt/Eastwood/eastwoodcountyroad.htm].

==The People and Business==
Eastwood is a harmonious [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] suburb. Its commercial district is becoming well known as an Asian shopping precinct, with specialty stores, supermarkets and a surplus of restaurants run by Chinese, Korean, Sri Lankan and Indian retailers. The Eastwood Shopping Centre, which includes major retailer [[Woolworths (supermarkets)|Woolworths]], is located in the town centre and opens on to the Eastwood Plaza. The Plaza features a fountain and several cafes with outdoor seating.

While most of Eastwood is residential, with one or two-storey buildings and villas, the area surrounding the town centre boasts buildings up to seven storeys high. There is a controversial proposal to further develop the Eastwood CBD {{Fact|date=February 2007}}, and infrastructure improvements would be necessary to compensate for the population increase. 

Eastwood used to have a lake which gave the names Lakeside Road and The Lakeside Road Uniting Church. This lake was later converted to an oval which is used for soccer matches and by local schools.

Eastwood is also home to the Corrective Services Academy, a training centre for prison officers.
