The '''Indian Creek massacre''' occurred on [[May 21]], [[1832]] when a group of settlers living 6 miles north of [[Ottawa, Illinois|Ottawa]], [[Illinois]], [[United States]], along Indian Creek, were attacked by a party of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. The massacre likely resulted from a local settler's stubborn refusal to remove a dam which jeopardized a key food source for a nearby [[Potawatomi]] village. A band of between 20 and 40 Potawatomi and three [[Sauk]] warriors attacked the cabin site. Fifteen settlers, including women and children, were massacred at the site near the present-day border of [[LaSalle County, Illinois|LaSalle]] and [[DeKalb County, Illinois|DeKalb Counties]]. Several people escaped the massacre and two young women were kidnapped by the raiders to be released about two weeks later unharmed.

In the aftermath of the massacre white settlers fled their homes for the safety of frontier forts and the protection of the militia. The Indian Creek massacre was later used as justification when U.S. soldiers and militia massacred many in [[Black Hawk (chief)|Black Hawk's]] band at the [[Battle of Bad Axe]]. The events at Indian Creek were peripherally related to the [[Black Hawk War]] and are seen as an act of personal revenge that was not sanctioned by Black Hawk. Though there are a number of historical discrepancies in the details surrounding the events at Indian Creek, historians have generally agreed on the contentious points. Today, the site of the massacre is marked by a memorial in northern [[LaSalle County, Illinois|LaSalle County]].

==Background==
As a consequence of an 1804 treaty between the [[Governor]] of [[Indiana Territory]] and a group of Sauk and Fox leaders regarding land settlement, the Sauk and Fox tribes vacated their lands in [[Illinois]] and moved west of the [[Mississippi]] in 1828. However, Sauk Chief [[Black Hawk (chief)|Black Hawk]] and others disputed the treaty, claiming that the full tribal councils had not been consulted, nor did those representing the tribes have authorization to cede lands.<ref name=lewis/> Angered by the loss of his birthplace, between 1830&ndash;31 Black Hawk led a number of incursions across the [[Mississippi River]], but was persuaded to return west each time without bloodshed. In April 1832, encouraged by promises of alliance with other tribes and the [[United Kingdom|British]], he again moved his so-called "British Band" of around 1000 warriors and non-combatants into Illinois.<ref name=lewis>Lewis, James.

Retrieved [[August 1]] [[2007]].</ref> Finding no allies, he attempted to return to [[Iowa]], but the undisciplined Illinois militia's actions led to the [[Battle of Stillman's Run]].<ref name=wiscsr>"[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/diary/002795.asp May 14: Black Hawk's Victory at the Battle of Stillman's Run]," Historic Diaries: The Black Hawk War, ''Wisconsin State Historical Society''. Retrieved [[6 August]] [[2007]].</ref> A number of other engagements followed, and the militias of [[Michigan Territory]] and Illinois were mobilized to hunt down Black Hawk's Band. The conflict became known as the [[Black Hawk War]].

== Prelude ==
[[Image:Shabbona (chief)1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Potawatomi]] chief [[Shabbona (chief)|Shabbona]] tried to warn the settlers at Indian Creek of the impending danger on [[May 16]], [[1832]].]]
The attack at Indian Creek was most likely spurred by the provocations of a settler named William Davis.<ref name=dekalb>McIntyre, Mac. "[http://www.dekalbcounty-il.com/massacre.html The Indian Creek Massacre]," 2000, DeKalb County History, ''DeKalb County Online''. Retrieved [[5 August]] [[2007]].</ref> Davis was a blacksmith and a mill operator and had dammed [[Indian Creek (Illinois)|Indian Creek]], a vital source of food to a nearby Potawatomi village. Specifically, Davis had raised the ire of [[Keewasee]], a young [[Potawatomi]] who lived in the village. Keewasee requested Davis remove the dam but his pleas went unheeded and were contemptuously denied.<ref name=matile2/> Before [[Black Hawk]] crossed the [[Mississippi River]] on [[April 5]], [[1832]], Keewasee had tried to tear down the Davis dam but was caught while doing so and beaten by Davis with a hickory stick.<ref name=dekalb/> At the same time, the [[Black Hawk War]] had erupted in [[Illinois]] and the first battle at [[Battle of Stillman's Run|Stillman's Run]] proved to be a victory for [[Black Hawk (chief)|Black Hawk]]'s band. This event may have also encouraged the assault at Indian Creek.<ref name=matile2/> 

In the days preceding the massacre, Black Hawk met with Potawatomi chiefs [[Shabbona (chief)|Shabbona]], [[Waubonsee (chief)|Waubonsee]] and others in an attempt to persuade them to join his "[[British Band]]" of [[Sauk]] and [[Fox (tribe)|Fox]] warriors. "Join me," Black Hawk said, "and our warriors will number like the trees in the forests." To which Shabbona replied, "that is true, but the white men number like the leaves on those trees."<ref name=dekalb/> On [[May 16]], [[1832]] Shabbona, knowing he could not control all of his people (the tribe he was closely intermingled and married into), rode across northern Illinois to warn the settlers of impending danger. It is recorded that during this ride Shabbona warned Davis and the others at his settlement of the danger.<ref name=dekalb/> After the battle at Stillman's Run, rumors of an attack on white settlers became widespread. The settlement at the creek had ample cause to evacuate, but at the urging of Davis the inhabitants ignored the warning and opted to stay.<ref name=matile2/> 

Present from the Davis family at the Indian Creek site the day of the massacre were William Davis, his wife and six children, including James Davis and William Davis, Jr.<ref name=dekalb/> Also present were William Pettigrew, his wife and two children, John Hall, his wife, three daughters (including Rachel and Sylvia) and three sons, and Henry George, J.H. Henderson, and William Robert Norris.<ref name=dekalb/><ref name=matile2/> The band of Potawatomi that attacked the Davis settlement at Indian Creek was led by Keewasee, who recruited members from Shabbona's tribe who were angry with the chief for failing to join Black Hawk. Among these were a number of young braves including Comee and Taquawee; another member of Keewasee's group, Mahokee, was Black Hawk's brother-in-law, who had joined the group inadvertently.<ref name=dekalb/>

== Massacre ==

Between 20 and 40 [[Potawatomi]] and three [[Sauk]], led by the notorious outlaw [[Mike Girty]], attacked the Davis Indian Creek settlement on the afternoon of [[May 21]], [[1832]].<ref name=dekalb/><ref name=barton>Barton, Albert O.

Henderson and some of the older boys were working in the fields, and Norris was working in Davis' blacksmith shop.<ref name=matile2/> The cabins were stormed and the inhabitants, including Mrs. Davis, Hall and Pettigrew along with several children, were killed. Davis and the other men could not reach the cabin in time to help the occupants but it is thought that Davis survived long enough to kill one of the raiders.<ref name=dekalb/> The entire massacre, which claimed 15 lives, took about 10 minutes to complete.

Little was said or known about the actual events of the massacre; most of what was written focused on what happened to the women and children.<ref name=trask/> Thomas Ford later recounted, while failing to describe the events of the massacre, that some of those involved in the massacre related to each other "with infernal glee how the women had squeaked like geese when they were run through the body with [[spear]]s, or felt the sharp [[Tomahawk (axe)|tomahawk]] enter their heads."<ref name=trask>Trask, Kerry A.

It is believed that the Potawatomi Native Americans who attacked, along with the three Sauk Indians, were the only ones responsible for the massacre.<ref name=matile2>Matile, Roger.

==Kidnapping==
[[Image:Sylvia Hall1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sylvia Hall]], shown in this undated photo, was one of seven survivors of the Indian Creek massacre.]]
The prisoners ended up in the care of Black Hawk until they were ransomed. After the war, Black Hawk related that it was the three Sauk warriors with the Potawatomi who saved the Hall sisters' lives. Black Hawk recounted:

{{cquote|"They were brought to our encampment, and a messenger sent to the Winnebagoes, as they were friendly on both sides, to come and get them, and carry them to the whites. If these young men, belonging to my band, had not gone with the Pottowittomies (sic), the two young squaws would have shared the same fate as their friends."}}

Rachel and Sylvia Hall were held for 11 days.  Most of the time was spent at Black Hawk's camp where they were treated well.<ref name=lewis/> With the help of the [[Ho-Chunk]], [[Bureau of Indian Affairs|U.S. Indian Agent]] Henry Gratiot eventually paid a [[ransom]] for the girls of ten horses, [[wampum]], and corn. The Hall sisters were released unharmed on [[June 1]], [[1832]].<ref name=wisc/><ref name=lewis/>

==Discrepancies==
There are number of discrepancies found in accounts of the Indian Creek massacre, especially concerning the date, details surrounding the Hall kidnapping, and the number of victims. The date of the massacre, which [[historian]]s generally agree occurred on [[May 21]], [[1832]], was recorded by the Hall sisters as [[May 20]] when they wrote down their account of the event in 1867. General [[Henry Atkinson]], on the other hand, gave the date of the massacre as [[May 22]] in a [[May 27]] order he issued from [[Dixon's Ferry]].<ref name=barton/>

Another historical discrepancy concerns the number of victims of the massacre. Some accounts, even modern-day accounts, give the number of dead as 16 while others state 15.<ref name=dekalb/><ref name=barton/> The discrepancy arose from the fact that James Davis, after the massacre, was missing and [[Presumption of death|presumed dead]]. James escaped the attackers and thus survived the attack. The number of dead has been agreed upon at 15 by most accounts.<ref name=barton/>

Details surrounding the kidnapping of the Hall sisters are also convoluted. The girls' age is one point of contention; some sources assert that Rachel was 15 and Sylvia 17 at the time of the attack.<ref name=lewis/><ref name=barton/> However, Sylvia Hall was born in February 1813 and her tombstone records indicated that she died on [[January 11]], [[1899]] aged 85 years 10 months and 16 days. Thus, Rachel was 17 and Sylvia just over 19 years of age at the time of the massacre and kidnapping.<ref name=barton/>

== Aftermath ==
The killings triggered [[mass hysteria]] in the white population nearby. People abandoned settlements and sought refuge inside frontier forts, such as [[Fort Dearborn]] in [[Chicago]].<ref name=matile/> News of the massacre spread quickly around the nation and helped to spread fear of Black Hawk and his band of warriors.<ref name=dekalb/> The Indian Creek massacre was one of the most famous and well publicized incidents during the Black Hawk War.<ref name=wisc/>

On [[May 21]] or 22 the people in Chicago, including those who had fled there, dispatched a company of scouts to ascertain the situation in the area between Chicago and Ottawa, along the Chicago to Ottawa Trail. The detachment, under the command of former Illinois militia Brigadier General [[Jesse B. Brown]], came upon the mangled remains of the 15 victims at Indian Creek on [[May 22]]. They buried the dead and continued to Ottawa where they reported their grisly discovery.<ref name=matile>Matile, Roger. "[http://www.ledgersentinel.com/article.asp?a=6258 U.S Army, cholera mark end of Black Hawk War]," ''Ledger-Sentinel'' (Oswego, Illinois), [[14 June]] [[2007]]. Retrieved [[5 August]] [[2007]].</ref>

As a result, the Illinois Militia used the event to draw more recruits from Illinois and [[Kentucky]].<ref name=wisc/> The war would end at the [[Battle of Bad Axe]] with the massacre of much of Black Hawk's "British Band;" the events at Indian Creek were used to justify the slaughter.<ref name=dekalb/> At Bad Axe, as Black Hawk and his delegates approached the [[steam boat]] ''[[Warrior (steamboat)|Warrior]]'', cries of "Remember Indian Creek!" were heard from the ship just before the ship's [[cannon]]s opened fire on the Native Americans.<ref name=dekalb/>

After the war, three Potawatomi were charged with murder for the Indian Creek massacre and [[arrest warrant|warrant]]s were issued at the [[LaSalle County, Illinois|LaSalle County]] Courthouse for Keewasee, Taquawee and Comee. The charges were dropped when the Hall sisters could not identify the attackers; the war paint they wore during the attack disguised them enough to prevent positive identification.<ref name=matile2/> In 1833 the [[Illinois General Assembly]] passed a law granting each of the Hall sisters 80 acres of land along the [[Illinois and Michigan Canal]] as compensation and recognition for the hardships they had endured.<ref name=ilsec/>

Today, a memorial marker with the names of those killed in the massacre is located in Shabbona Park in northern LaSalle County, west of [[Illinois Route 23]]. The marker was erected in 1905.<ref name=dekalb/>
