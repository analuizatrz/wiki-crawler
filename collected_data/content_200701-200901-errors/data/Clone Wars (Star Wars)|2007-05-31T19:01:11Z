The '''Clone Wars''' (also known as the '''Clone War''') are a series of fictional [[Star Wars galaxy|intragalactic]] battles in [[George Lucas]]'s [[science fiction]] saga ''[[Star Wars]]''. The conflict is first mentioned in ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]'' (1977),<ref name="CloneWarsBasics">{{cite web | author= | title="Starwars.com: What are the Clone Wars?"| url=http://www.starwars.com/clonewars/about/whatarecw.html | publisher=[[Starwars.com]] | year=[[2006]] | accessmonthday=August 3 |accessyear=2006}}</ref> but not featured in ''Star Wars'' fiction until the second and third episodes of the six-part ''Star Wars'' film series: ''[[Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'' (2002) and ''[[Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]'' (2005). The animated [[microseries]] ''[[Star Wars: Clone Wars]]'' (2003-2005) chronicle the major campaigns of the war. Additional events and stories are detailed in a multimedia campaign consisting of ''Star Wars'' [[Expanded Universe (Star Wars)|literature and video games]]. Many of the events featured have parallels in history, politics, and mythology from which Lucas and other writers drew inspiration. Critics and film historians debate which parallels are most prominent or consistent.

The Clone Wars begin during the Separatist Crisis when thousands of [[solar system|star systems]] [[seceded]] from the [[Galactic Republic (Star Wars)|Galactic Republic]] to form the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] (CIS). The [[Battle of Geonosis|first battle]] occurs on the CIS planet [[Geonosis]] where the Republic's new [[clone trooper|clone army]], led by [[Jedi]] generals, combats the Separatists' [[battle droids]].  War quickly spreads across the galaxy and eventually reaches the Republic's capital, [[Coruscant]]. The Clone Wars end shortly after the [[Great Jedi Purge]], the Separatist Massacre on [[Mustafar]], and the establishment of the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]]. The events causing the war and those leading to its conclusion are orchestrated by the Republic's chief executive, [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Palpatine]].<ref name="Trilogy">[[George Lucas|Lucas, George]].

== Origins ==
[[Image:Palpatine1.jpg|right|175px|thumb|The character [[Palpatine]] used the Clone Wars to start the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]].]]
The beginnings of the war are first portrayed in the 1999 film ''[[Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace|The Phantom Menace]]'' (the first chapter but fourth release in the series) as the [[Invasion of Theed]] and the [[Battle of Naboo]]. However, the real tension begins with the Separatist Crisis, a series of debates in the [[Galactic Republic]] that are referred to in ''Attack of the Clones'', and began about two years prior to the start of that film. By the beginning of ''Attack of the Clones'', many [[solar system|star systems]] had [[secession|seceded]] from the Republic. The tension caused by this secession eventually led to the outbreak of war.<ref name="PalpatineRise">{{cite web | author= | title="Palpatine at Star Wars: Databank"| url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/palpatine/index.html | publisher=[[Starwars.com]]|year=[[2006]] | accessmonthday=August 3 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> The war had different causes. Palpatine told the people that the war began because of several different reasons such as the years of separation by the outer rim territories, the separatists capture of the Jedi and the Separatists financing of rebellions by radical states within the Republic. This was all true, but Palpatine had influenced all these events in secret with the help of his secret apprentice Count Dooku.

The war is engineered by [[Palpatine|Senator Palpatine]] to [[#Political|facilitate his own rise to power]] and the formation of the Galactic Empire. He plays both sides against each other &mdash; as a Republic Senator (and later Chancellor) advocating more centralized powers to keep the Republic together, and as the mysterious Sith Lord Darth Sidious, by advising the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatists]].<ref name="PalpatineRise" /> The Clone Wars thus become the first of two major [[civil war]]s in the ''Star Wars'' galaxy, the other being the [[Galactic Civil War]] featured in ''A New Hope'', ''[[Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back|The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980), and ''[[Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi|Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983).

== Story ==
The origins of the Clone Wars began 32 years before the events of ''A New Hope'' (the first film produced in the series). The opening of the war, referred to in the [[prequel trilogy (Star Wars)|prequel trilogy]] as the [[Battle of Naboo]], is portrayed in ''The Phantom Menace''. The [[Trade Federation]], a major galactic trade organization secretly controlled by the [[Sith]],  blockaded the planet [[Naboo]] and demanded the capitulation of the world by its [[Queen regnant|Queen]], [[Padmé Amidala]]. Queen Amidala refused and requested help from the [[Galactic Republic (Star Wars)|Republic]], the group responsible for governing the ''Star Wars'' galaxy. The Republic responded by sending two [[Jedi]] [[ambassador]]s, Master [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] and his apprentice [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], to help free the world. After a few small skirmishes, including an assassination attempt by a Sith warrior named [[Darth Maul]], the Jedi and Naboo military liberated the world with the help of the native [[Gungan]]s, represented in the film by the [[computer animation|computer-animated]] character [[Jar-Jar Binks]].<ref>{{cite web | author=George Lucas | title="Star Wars: The Phantom Menace Script at IMSDb| url=http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Star-Wars-The-Phantom-Menace.html | publisher=[[IMSDb]] and [[Lucasfilm]]|year=[[1999]] | accessmonthday=August 3 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

[[Image:Imperialmarch.jpg|left|thumb|300px|In ''Attack of the Clones'', the Republic amasses a large [[Clone trooper|clone]] [[Army of the Republic|army]] that was secretly ordered by [[Palpatine]] over a decade before.]]
Shortly after these events, the Jedi [[Count Dooku|Dooku]] resigned his commission and returned to his homeworld of Serenno.<ref>{{cite web | author= | title="Count Dooku at Star Wars: Databank"| url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/countdooku/index.html | publisher=[[Starwars.com]] | year=[[2006]] | accessmonthday=August 3 |accessyear=2006}}</ref>  Unbeknownst to the [[Jedi Council]] (the "ruling body" of the Jedi), Dooku had fallen under the control of the evil Sith master [[Darth Sidious]]. Dooku and Sidious arranged for an army of [[Clone trooper|clone]]s to be produced by the [[Kamino]]ans under the name of the Jedi Master [[Sifo-Dyas]]. This is portrayed as a mystery during the rising action of ''Attack of the Clones''.

By this time, the Republic was facing internal opposition as several thousand worlds [[secession|seceded]]. The Republic Senate proposed the Military Creation Act, with allowed for the development of a large military.<ref name="MilitaryCreationAct">'''PADME:''' I haven't worked for a year to defeat the "Military Creation Act" not to be here when its fate is decided.{{cite web | author=George Lucas | title="Star Wars: Attack of the Clones Script at IMSDb| url=http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Star-Wars-Attack-of-the-Clones.html | publisher=[[IMSDb]] and [[Lucasfilm]]|year=[[2002]] | accessmonthday=August 3 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>
While most senators supported the act, it saw great opposition from Padmé Amidala,<ref name="MilitaryCreationAct" /> who by now was the senator for Naboo. The act never came to a vote, due to the discovery of the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]]' military force on [[Geonosis]] and the subsequent [[Battle of Geonosis]], which saw the loss of numerous Jedi Knights and the [[bounty hunter]] [[Jango Fett]]. [[Palpatine|Chancellor Palpatine]], the [[Head of State|head of state]] of the Republic, was quickly granted emergency powers by the Republic Senate. He used these powers to raise the Grand Army of the Republic, a large military force made up of [[clone troopers]] illicitly commissioned by Dooku and Sidious. The Battle of Geonosis marks the end of ''Attack of the Clones''.

During the in-universe time period between ''Attack of the Clones'' and ''Revenge of the Sith'', conflict between the Republic and the Separatists increased and expanded, which is chronicled in an extensive [[#Multimedia campaign|Multimedia campaign]]. During the early months, Dooku seizes control of a superweapon called the [[Dark Reaper]] (seen in [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars|the video game]] and ''[[Boba Fett: Crossfire]]''). After several years, the Republic begins the Outer Rim Sieges, which is also primarily chronicled in the multimedia campaign and ''Revenge of the Sith'', the third film in the trilogy.<ref>'''OBI-WAN:''' You missed the report on the Outer Rim sieges. / '''ANAKIN:''' I'm sorry, I was held up. I have no excuse. / '''OBI-WAN:''' In short, they are going very well. Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos has moved his troops to Boz Pity. {{cite web | author=George Lucas | title="Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith Script at IMSDb| url=http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Star-Wars-Revenge-of-the-Sith.html | publisher=[[IMSDb]] and [[Lucasfilm]]|year=[[2005-05-19]] | accessmonthday=August 3 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

[[Image:01724.jpeg|right|thumb|300px|The [[Battle of Coruscant]], as depicted in the opening minutes of ''Revenge of the Sith''.]]
Three years after the Battle of Geonosis, ''Revenge of the Sith'', opens with the CIS' [[Battle of Coruscant|attempt to kidnap Chancellor Palpatine]] on the Republic capital world of [[Coruscant]]. The Chancellor was rescued, due to the efforts of Jedi Master Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker.

During this point in the timeline, the Outer Rim Sieges were in full swing. One of the key battles of the Outer Rim Sieges was the [[Battle of Utapau]], depicted in ''Revenge of the Sith''. The Separatist leader, [[General Grievous]], was killed by Obi-Wan Kenobi in this battle. Other Outer Rim skirmishes &mdash; such as the [[Battle of Belderone]] &mdash; occur in the [[Star Wars: Clone Wars|animated series]] and several novels.

Meanwhile, battles continued to rage all across the ''Star Wars'' galaxy. The Jedi, who were the commanders of the Republic military, were scattered across the galaxy at battles as diverse as [[Battle of Mygeeto|Mygeeto]], [[Battle of Felucia|Felucia]], and [[Battle of Kashyyyk|Kashyyyk]] (the latter being commanded by the Jedi Master [[Yoda]], a main character in the films ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and ''Return of the Jedi'').

It was during this part of the story that Anakin Skywalker fell prey to the dark side. Stumbling into a duel between [[Mace Windu]] and [[Palpatine|Chancellor Palpatine]], Skywalker slashed Windu's lightsaber hand off, allowing Palpatine to kill Windu. He was soon renamed [[Darth Vader]] and completely fell under the sway of the dark side.

Palpatine [[Mission to Mustafar|dispatched Skywalker to Mustafar]] to kill off the rest of the CIS leaders, while he himself issued [[Order 66]], an order for all the clone troopers to execute their Jedi commanders. The few survivors of the [[Great Jedi Purge]] included Yoda and Obi-Wan. With the extermination of the Jedi and the Confederacy leadership, Palpatine marks an end to the Republic, thus creating the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]]. ''Revenge of the Sith'' then undergoes its climax with personal battles between Yoda/Palpatine and Kenobi/Skywalker.

== Allusions ==
Like all themes within ''Star Wars'', the Clone Wars borrows from multiple mythical, literary, and historical influences and parallels. Writers and critics have debated over which parallels are most prominent or consistent.

=== Political ===
[[Image:Palps Senate.JPG|right|thumb|300px|[[Palpatine]]'s orchestration of the Clone Wars has been compared to [[Nazi Germany]], the [[Vietnam War]], and the [[Roman Empire]].]]
In the ''Star Wars'' timeline, both the Clone Wars and its results are portrayed as the process which shifted the Galactic Republic from a [[democracy]] to a [[dictatorship]]. In a 2002 [[TIME Magazine]] interview, ''Star Wars'' creator [[George Lucas]] explains:

: "All [[democracy|democracies]] turn into [[dictatorship]]s&mdash;but not by coup. The people give their democracy to a dictator, whether it's [[Julius Caesar]] or [[Napoleon]] or [[Adolf Hitler]]. Ultimately, the general population goes along with the idea. What kinds of things push people and institutions in this direction? That's the issue I've been exploring: how did the Republic turn into the Empire? … How does a good person go bad, and how does a democracy become a dictatorship?"<ref>{{cite web | author=TIME Magazine | title="All democracies turn into dictatorships…" | url=http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/670092/posts | publisher=[[TIME Magazine]]|year=[[2002-04-21]] | accessmonthday=July 6 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

In ''Attack of the Clones'', [[Palpatine]] orchestrates the Separatist movement (and the Clone Wars that followed) to worry the citizens of the Republic, thus forcing the Senate to grant him emergency powers. According to character [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], these powers increase as the Clone Wars extend into a search for [[General Grevious]], who replaces [[Count Dooku]] as Separatist leader.<ref>"'''OBI-WAN:''' The Senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the Chancellor today." {{cite web | author=George Lucas | title="Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith Script at IMSDb"| url=http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Star-Wars-Revenge-of-the-Sith.html | publisher=[[IMSDb]] and [[Lucasfilm]] | year=[[2005-05-19]] | accessmonthday=July 6 | accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref>"'''PALPATINE:''' That may be true, but with Count Dooku dead, [General Grevious] is the leader of the Droid Army, and I assure you, the Senate will vote to continue the war as long as Grievous is alive." {{cite web | author=George Lucas | title="Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith Script at IMSDb"| url=http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Star-Wars-Revenge-of-the-Sith.html | publisher=[[IMSDb]] and [[Lucasfilm]] | year=[[2005-05-19]] | accessmonthday=July 6 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> During ''Revenge of the Sith'', Palpatine declares himself Emperor by blaming the Jedi for the Republic's problems, resulting in a Jedi purge via [[Order 66]].<ref>"'''PALPATINE/DARTH SlDIOUS:''' Commander Cody, the time has come.

Comparisons have been made between the political aspects of the Clone Wars and the events leading up to [[World War II]]. Radio host [[Clyde Lewis]]' article on historical similarities in Star Wars claims that Palpatine's tactics parallel those of [[Adolf Hitler]] and Nazi Germany; both leaders used wars and [[scapegoat]]s to manipulate society's emotional state, thus providing the leadership with support and power.<ref>{{cite web | author=Clyde Lewis | title="The Sith Sense"| url=http://www.groundzeromedia.org/dis/sith/sith.shtml | publisher=[[Ground Zero]] | year=[[2005]] | accessmonthday=July 6 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> This viewpoint was also expressed in an editorial on the Clone Wars Unofficial Website.<ref>{{cite web | author=Andrew Liptak | title="The Sith Sense"| url=http://www.clonewarz.com/features/editorials/cwempire.htm | publisher=The Clone Wars Unofficial Website | year=[[2003-06-17]] | accessmonthday=July 6 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Another writer compares the Clone Wars with [[World War II]] in general, basing his argument on the fact that Lucas was born during the [[baby boomer]] generation, and the [[Galactic Civil War|dark times]] featured in the original trilogy rival the dark, uncertain [[Cold War]].<ref>{{cite web | author=Stephen Chambers | title="Star Wars As Baby Boomer Script"| url=http://www.radicalcenter.net/index.php?module=pagemaster&PAGE_user_op=view_page&PAGE_id=52 | publisher=Radical Center | year=[[2006-04-18]] | accessmonthday=July 6 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>  Lucas, however, cited in multiple interviews that one of his primary influences for the political backdrop behind the Clone Wars (and all of Star Wars) was the Vietnam/Watergate era, when leaders embraced corruption for what they thought was the best course of action.<ref>{{cite web | author=David Germain | title="'Star Wars' Raises Questions on US Policy" | url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/0517-07.htm | publisher=Associated Press | year=[[2005-05-17]] | accessmonthday=July 6 | accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author=Chris Burns | title="Lucas on Iraq war, 'Star Wars'" | url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/SHOWBIZ/Movies/05/16/cannes.starwars/ | publisher=CNN.com|year=[[2005-05-16]] | accessmonthday=July 6 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

There is a variety of opinions on the historical parallels between the political aspects of the Clone Wars and the [[War in Iraq]]. In claiming that the Star Wars galaxy under the deceitful Palpatine parallels the modern issues of the [[United States]], an editorial on [[Antiwar.com]] states that "[Star Wars] establishes first the generally agreeable premise that it's right to overthrow oppressive government, before bringing into focus something more discomforting – that the corrupt tyranny referred to is our own".<ref>{{cite web | author=Scott Horton | title="Star Wars and the American Empire"| url=http://www.antiwar.com/orig/horton.php?articleid=6041 | publisher=AntiWar.com | year=[[2005-05-23]] | accessmonthday=July 6 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Additionally, an article from Wiretap claims that "like Palpatine, the Bush administration has been able to feed on people's fears to gain more power".<ref>{{cite web | author=Brian Fanelli | title="U.S. Politics in "A Galaxy Far, Far Away""| url=http://www.wiretapmag.org/stories/22284 | year=[[2005-06-22]]}}</ref> However, in an interview with Kiro 7 News, ''Star Wars'' producer [[Rick McCallum]] explained:

: "George is a product of Vietnam, not a product of Bush. [The political aspects of the Clone Wars] has been in the context of every script I've ever read&mdash;every draft&mdash;way before Bush became president…"<ref>{{cite web | author=Tim Lammers | title="DVD Is Hardly End For 'Sith' Producer McCallum"| url=http://www.kirotv.com/starwars/5221153/detail.html | publisher=KIROTV.com | year=[[2005-11-02]] | accessmonthday=July 6 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

Lucas claims, however, that "The parallels between what we did in Vietnam and what we're doing in Iraq now are unbelievable."  Nevertheless, he states that "When I wrote [the backstory/Clone Wars], Iraq didn't exist".<ref>{{cite web | author=David Germain | title="'Star Wars' Raises Questions on US Policy" | url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/0517-07.htm | publisher=Associated Press | year=[[2005-05-17]] | accessmonthday=July 6 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

=== Military ===
The Clone Wars involve parallels to the [[American Civil War]] in many respects. The Confederacy of Independent Systems shares a similar name to the [[Confederate States of America]]; it also seceded from the Republic, much like the south seceded from the Union. Like Confederate General [[Robert E. Lee]], Count Dooku was respected by his enemies, and had he survived, he most likely would have been accepted by them.<ref>{{cite book | first=Matthew Woodring | last=Stover | authorlink=Matthew Stover | year=2005 | title=Revenge of the Sith | publisher=Del Rey | id=ISBN 0-345-42883-8}}</ref>

Order 66 &mdash; one of the major events at the conflict's conclusion in ''Revenge of the Sith'' &mdash; features several real-world parallels. Order 66 also echoes the destruction of the [[Knights Templar]] order, another order of protectors who were raided by the secular forces such as [[King Philip IV]]'s. In addition, the ultimate (and secret) order to begin their dissolution was given by a trusted leader—the [[Pope]], in the case of the Knights Templar (the Knights Templar, like all monastic orders, ultimately derived its authority and permission to exist from the Pope; the Jedi order existed independently of the office of Supreme Chancellor, but were about to be brought under its legal umbrella in ''Revenge of the Sith'', instead of deriving its existence from the Old Republic in general, and its legislature specifically).

<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Clone wars.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Two Jedi characters, [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and [[Anakin Skywalker]], are the main protagonists in the Clone Wars animated series.]] -->
The Clone Wars span the three years between ''Attack of the Clones'' and ''Revenge of the Sith'', and thus are, for the most part, off-screen. The Expanded Universe is recounting events with an ambitious [[multimedia]] campaign.<ref name="CloneWarsBasics" />

The videogame ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'' was released in 2002 for [[PlayStation 2]], [[GameCube]], and [[Xbox]].  It is set immediately after the final events of ''Attack of the Clones'', and spans many new worlds and settings not mentioned in the films or novelizations. Additionally, ''[[Star Wars: Battlefront]]'', ''[[Star Wars: Jedi Starfighter]]'', ''[[Star Wars: Republic Commando]]'', and ''[[Star Wars: Battlefront II]]'' expand the scenarios of the conflict and add new angles to previously covered battles.

The cartoon [[miniseries|microseries]] ''[[Star Wars: Clone Wars]]'' started airing in November 2003 on [[Cartoon Network]]. It was a series of 20 episodes, each three to five minutes long, showing several of the battles of the war not mentioned in any of the films. Another five episodes, each fifteen minutes long, were made to serve as a prelude to ''Revenge of the Sith''.  It is scheduled to become a [[3D computer graphics|3D animated]] television series.<ref>{{cite web | author=BBC News | title=Star Wars to become new TV series | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4484915.stm | publisher=[[BBC News]]|year=[[2005-04-26]] | accessmonthday=May 5 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

The comic series ''[[Star Wars: Republic]]'' has also shed light on this era of the ''Star Wars'' universe, focusing in particular on the exploits of the Jedi characters Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, [[Quinlan Vos]], and [[Aayla Secura]].<ref name="CloneWarsBasics" /> Multiple series of [[List of Star Wars books#The Clone Wars Series (22.5 BBY - 19.5 BBY)|novels]] based on all aspects of the Clone Wars have been published, as well.
