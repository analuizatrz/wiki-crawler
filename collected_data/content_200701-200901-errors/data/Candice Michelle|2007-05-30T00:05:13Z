'''Candice Michelle Beckman-Ehrlich''' (born [[September 30]], [[1978]] in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]), better known as '''Candice Michelle''' or just '''Candice''', is an [[United States|American]] model, [[actress]], and [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]], currently working for [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] on its ''[[WWE Raw|RAW]]'' [[WWE Brand Extension|brand]].

==World Wrestling Entertainment== 
===Diva Search and roster changes (2004-2005)===
Candice Michelle came to [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] as a contestant in the [[WWE Diva Search#2004|Diva Search 2004]]. Although she wasn't one of the final ten contestants to make it to the televised event, WWE hired Candice anyway and placed her on the ''RAW'' brand under the [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] of a [[makeup]] artist. Initially, Candice Michelle's role was limited. She was never given an [[angle (professional wrestling)|angle]] on ''RAW'' and she rarely made [[television]] appearances unless to participate in one of the program's occasional lingerie [[pillow fight]]s or [[bikini]] contests that were held between [[Christy Hemme]], [[Maria Kanellis]], [[Stacy Keibler]], and herself.

On [[June 30]] [[2005]], at the end of the [[WWE Draft Lottery]], Candice Michelle was traded to the ''[[WWE Friday Night SmackDown!|SmackDown!]]'' brand, where she became involved in a [[feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] between [[Torrie Wilson]] and [[Melina Perez|Melina]]. Candice Michelle quickly became [[Jillian Hall]] and Melina's rival when she befriended Wilson. On [[July 24]] [[2005]], at ''[[The Great American Bash#2005|The Great American Bash 2005]]'', Candice Michelle served as the [[Professional wrestling match types#Special referee|Special Guest Referee]] for the [[Professional wrestling match types#Bra and Panties match|Bra and Panties match]] between Torrie Wilson and Melina. Melina was victorious, and after the match, Melina pushed Candice from behind. This resulted in both divas attacking Melina and removing her bottoms as well.

She was then moved to ''RAW'' in a trade along with Wilson, while Keibler and Hemme went to ''SmackDown!''. From that point on, Candice and Wilson taunted [[Ashley Massaro]] (2005 WWE Diva Search Winner), bringing in [[Lisa Marie Varon|Victoria]] to attack her as part of their "initiation" for the new [[WWE Diva|Diva]]. This continued on until [[Trish Stratus]] returned from an injury to help Massaro retaliate against Candice and her two cohorts, who became known as the [[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] [[stable (professional wrestling)|stable]] Ladies in Pink, and later known as '''[[Vince's Devils]]''', a play on ''[[Charlie's Angels]]''. Candice began a new gimmick where she acted like a [[princess]] and would go to the ring carrying a plastic [[wand]] and opening her jacket to the crowd while standing on the ring apron to reveal her risque' wrestling attire. Also during this time, Candice's had a shot at the [[WWE Women's Championship]] at [[WWE Cyber Sunday#2005|Taboo Tuesday 2005]], where she lost in a Fulfill Your Fantasy Battle Royal.

===2006===
She would appear at ''[[WWE New Year's Revolution#2006|New Year's Revolution 2006]]'' in the first ever [[Professional wrestling match types#Bra & Panties Gauntlet match|Bra and Panties Gauntlet Match]], but was elimated by [[Maria Kanellis|Maria]]. After winning a Women's Battle Royal on ''RAW'', Candice Michelle would get her first singles [[WWE Women's Championship]] match while a part of [[Vince's Devils]], but lost to then-champion [[Trish Stratus]] on [[February 27]] [[2006]]. After this match, Candice Michelle slapped Wilson, blaming her for the loss.

Vince's Devils later broke up when Torrie Wilson [[turn (professional wrestling)|turned]] [[face (professional wrestling)|face]] when Candice Michelle and [[Lisa Marie Varon|Victoria]] turned on her during Candice's ''[[Playboy]]'' cover unveiling. This lengthy feud between Candice Michelle and Wilson led to a match in which Playboy cover girl Candice Michelle would face off against the 2-time former cover girl (Wilson) at ''[[WrestleMania 22]]'' in a ''Playboy'' Pillow Fight. Wilson won the match, but the feud continued on-and-off in backstage segments where Candice was [[Vince McMahon]]'s "[[sex]] slave". In late 2006, they resolved the feud when they appeared in segments and matches together.

Candice also appeared in both of 2006's ''[[WWE Saturday Night's Main Event|Saturday Night's Main Events]]'' on [[NBC]]. In the [[March 18]] episode, she and Victoria lost to Trish Stratus and [[Mickie James]] in a tag team match. On the [[July 15]] program, Candice was eliminated in the first round of a Divas' bikini bull riding competition, won by [[Michelle McCool]].

On the [[July 17]] edition of ''RAW'', Candice was the Special Guest Referee during a tag team match between Trish Stratus and Torrie Wilson vs. Victoria and Mickie James. At one point, Mickie James got in Candice's face, but Candice retaliated by slapping her and tossing her out of the ring. Afterwards, Victoria tried to clothesline Candice, but she ducked, allowing Trish to hit the [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Springboard bulldog|Stratusfaction]] gaining the victory for her and Torrie Wilson. This incident resulted in Candice turning face. The feud with Mickie and Victoria lasted a few weeks. 

After ''[[WWE Unforgiven#2006|Unforgiven 2006]]'', Candice began a short feud with [[Amy Dumas|Lita]], winning a match against her the next night on ''RAW''. She lost a match against Lita the next week, after interference from [[Adam Copeland|Edge]] in the first round of the WWE Women's Championship tournament. She would later compete in the first ever Extreme Strip Poker segment on ''ECW on Sci-fi'' on [[October 10]] representing ''RAW''.

On [[November 27]] [[2006]] edition of ''RAW'', during the Women's Battle Royal, Candice suffered a broken nose when Victoria nailed her in the face with a savate kick.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.wwe.com/superstars/raw/candice/candycoated/020207 | author = Candice Michelle | title = Candy-Coated, No. 1 | accessmonthday= May 14 | accessyear = 2007 | date = February 3, 2007}}</ref> She had surgery on [[November 30]] to repair her [[deviated septum]].

===2007===
Candice returned at ''[[WWE New Year's Revolution#2007|New Year's Revolution 2007]]'' on [[January 7]] [[2007]], when she went down to the ring with [[Maria Kanellis|Maria]] to fight off [[Melina Perez|Melina]] as she tried to interfere in the [[WWE Women's Championship]] match between champion [[Mickie James]] and Victoria. Candice made her in-ring return on [[January 22]] when she and Mickie James defeated Victoria and Melina in a tag team match.  Her next feud came when Melina claimed in her [[blog]]s that all ''[[Playboy]]'' cover models were not capable of fighting her in the ring. Candice took offense to this and challenged Melina to a [[Professional wrestling match types#Bra and panties match|Bra and Panties Match]], which she lost. Candice resumed her feud with Melina weeks later when she teamed up with [[Mickie James]], defeating Victoria and Melina in both tag team matches and singles matches.

===Go Daddy===
Candice achieved a moment of notoriety in 2005 after appearing in a risqué TV commercial for [[GoDaddy.com]] that aired during [[Super Bowl XXXIX]]. Beckman played a woman petioning a broadcast censorship committee to appear in an advertisement who experiences a [[wardrobe malfunction]]. The ad was a [[parody]] of the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy]] involving [[Janet Jackson]] and [[Justin Timberlake]].

From then on she was often referred to as '''Miss GoDaddy.com''' or the '''Go Daddy Girl''' by fans, and on WWE, where she does the "Go Daddy Dance" (twirling her arm around her body) as part of her gimmick. In the following year, she was featured in another Go Daddy commercial at the 2006 NFL playoffs (this time as a window washer, cleaning windows seductively with her [[breast]]s contained in a bikini top). She appeared in another Super Bowl Go Daddy commercial during [[Super Bowl XL]], in a parody where she seduced an [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] executive in order to procure an ad slot for Go Daddy. She appeared in the Go Daddy commercial with the slogan "Everyone wants to work in marketing" for [[Super Bowl XLI]] in 2007, where Candice dances in a room while getting doused with champagne. To promote the 2007 commercial, she appeared on ''[[American Choppers]]'', also promoting GoDaddy.com's new chopper.
