The '''Geography of Newfoundland and Labrador''' describes Newfoundland and Labrador's [[topography]]. 

[[Image:NewFoundland-Labrador-Relief.png|thumb|right|250px|Relief of Newfoundland and Labrador]]
[[Newfoundland]] is a large island lying off the east coast of North America between latitudes 46½°N and 52°N. <ref name="abc">{{cite web|url=http://www2.marianopolis.edu/nfldhistory/Newfoundland%20geography.html|title=Histy-ography:Newfoundland and Labrador|accessdate=2006-11-23}}</ref> .<ref name="cde">{{cite web|url=http://www.nlbusiness.ca/aboutnl/location.html|title=Location and Travel|accessdate=2006-11-23}}</ref>  It's capital is [[St. John's]], which is in the same latitude (47½°) of [[Quebec]], [[Duluth]], [[Seattle]], [[Paris]], and [[Sakhalin island]] in the Pacific. <ref name="abc"/> .<ref name="deg">{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/newfoundland|title=Answers.com|accessdate=2006-11-23}}</ref>  It is Canada's most easterly province, consisting of the island of Newfoundland and the mainland portion of Labrador.<ref name="abc"/> <ref name="deg"/> Newfoundland has a triangular shape, stretching 320 miles across, and covering 43,000 square miles.<ref name="abc"/> It can be described as the size of [[Pennsylvania]], and larger than Ireland.<ref name="abc"/> It lies on the [[continental shelf]] of North America, as it is separated from [[Labrador]] by only 11 miles, and by Cape Breton by 70 miles. <ref name="abc"/>

==Geology==
Along the west coast lies an elongated block of the earth's crust (which is called a [[horst]]) that mostly rises to about 2,000 feet above sea level. <ref name="abc"/> This is named [[Long Range]] on maps and can be bounded by crustal cracks or [[faults]] on both east and west sides. To the east is the [[Grand Lake]] and [[Deer lake]]. This is about 20 miles wide probably due to a blocking of the crust dropping down to form the Grand Lake graben (depression).<ref name="abc"/> The plateau in the [[Avalon Peninsula]] is on general level 1,200 feet, which is a large part of Newfoundland. It is an elevated [[peneplain]], which has been elevated above sea level since relatively late geological time. Next, the plateau is joined by straight steep coastlines on the west, south, and southeast; in addition, these cracks are possibly caused along where the elevation has taken place. Many striking peaks or knobs are scattered over the plateau surfaces rising several hundred feet over general level. Best known is [[Maintopsail]], close to the railway at its highest point. <ref name="abc"/>

It can be pointed out that on elevated surface such as the above, built on various ancient rocks, the likeness to produce good soils for agriculture in climate conditions is unlikely in Newfoundland.<ref name="abc"/> In fact most of the island consists of extremely ancient rocks, that are in the Avalon Peninsula, and in Long Range that are as ancient as the Canadian shield’s.<ref name="abc"/> The middle part of the island includes large areas of [[Ordovician]] age as well. Moreover, in the graben south of [[white bay]], the [[Humber river]] flows across much newer rocks of [[Carboniferous age]]. As well as in the far south-west at [[Codroy]] there is a smaller graben with much younger rocks. They give the rise to better soils than occur elsewhere. Furthermore, there are smaller patches of fair soil located among the three main rivers, the Humber, [[Exploits]], and [[Gander]]. They naturally flow [[graben]] or corrugations noted here. Moreover, results in the conforming to the general direction of the crustal folds. The characteristic long [[promontories]] in or near Avalon, and in the north-west, are as well credited due to the same structural feature. <ref name="abc"/> Nearly the whole surface carries a [[veneer]] of glacial deposits, and large erratic blocks are natural on the inland plateau. It is home to pristine lakes and rivers. <ref name="abc"/>

Newfoundland lies on the northeastern boundary of the [[Appalachian Mountain]]s system--a mountain chain, once paralleled the east coast of North America from Newfoundland to Alabama. <ref name="geo">{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.nl.ca/l|title=Geological survey|accessdate=2006-02-17}}</ref> However, the Appalachian mountains are affected by the forces of erosion that result gently undulating terrain. <ref name="geo"/> Despite absences of the Rocky Mountain highs,  the erosion reveals that Newfoundland has an uncanny cross-section of the core of an ancient mountain belt, very well known by scientists all over the world. <ref name="geo"/>

Why is Newfoundland attracting hordes of geoscientists? The answer relates to the Earth’s tectonic plates. The tectonic plates are in a constant motion of breaking, separating, rub side-by-side against each other or collide. Newfoundland, in comparison, is where one of the earth’s greatest  continental plates split apart almost 600 million years ago and then collided again some 200 million years later.<ref name="geo"/> While this antediluvian (another word for ancient) continental plate split, two other small parts began to separate from each other, allowing for an ocean to form.<ref name="geo"/> It is named the [[Iapetus Ocean]], reaching at least 1000 km in width before the wayward drift of the continental pieces was halted, and when the two began to come together again. 
 
How does Newfoundland preserve its rocks?  In the Humber Zone, a geological center of Newfoundland, preserves 1200-1800 million year old gneisses, granites and [[anorthosites]] which comprise the [[Long Range Mountains]] of the Great Northern Peninsula, and bring about Indian Head and Steel Mountain near Stephenville.<ref name="geo"/> They are the remnants of the old,  kaput Canadian Shield 600 million years ago , forming a basement where sediments of Iapetus were laid down. In roadside outcrops and along the coastline of the [[Port au Port Peninsula]] and the [[Great Northern Peninsula]], those 400 to 600 million year old sedimentary  (prominently [[sandstones]] and carbonate) rocks ([[limestones]]), are well-exposed.<ref name="geo"/> In addition, these rocks characterize that there were ancient beaches and shallow marine carbonates.  <ref name="geo"/>

East of the Carbonate bank, that covers the present day Great Northern Peninsula, has a continental [[slope]] like the [[Grand Banks]] that gave way on the deep ocean floor. <ref name="geo"/>Around this rise were deposited shale, sandstone, deep-water limestone, volcanic rocks, and giant debris falls resulting from material broken off the carbonate bank and rolling down the slope. Between White Bay and the [[Baie Verte highway]], these rocks are observed. <ref name="geo"/>

As Iapetus began  closing about 450 million years ago and the Appalachian mountains were built down the east coast of North America, the ocean floor became creased and uplifted. <ref name="geo"/>Huge ( 40 by 10 km) slabs of ocean ground (the [[amphibolites]] multiparts) were squeezed out among the continental plates and  emplaced across the old continental margin. In the west coast, fine examples of the ophiolites, shape the scenic brown mountains of Western Newfoundland --[[ North Arm Mountain]], the [[Lewis Hills and Table Mountain]]  and the [[White Hills]] near [[St. Anthony]].<ref name="geo"/> One hundred million years later the old continental plate split once more, this time to form the present-day Atlantic Ocean. <ref name="geo"/>
   
Just as the Iapetus Mountains have been closed for 400  million years, Western Newfoundland has a  highland area, where vertical movement of crustal blocks along the major fault zones  led to the configuration  of two major basins.<ref name="geo"/>  Accretions of sediments occurred 345 about million and 280 million years ago.<ref name="geo"/> One of these basins extended from Deer Lake to Conche (the [[Deer Lake Basin]]) and the others extended from Stephenville to the Codroy Valley (the [[St. George's Bay Basin]]). Likely these basins resembled the [[Death Valley]] of California, enclosed by mountains, with vast alluvial fans from mountain scarps a shallow-lake [[lowland]].<ref name="geo"/> Sedimentary rocks deposited in both basins are conglomerate, sandstone,  shale and [[siltstone]] , commonly containing fossils of fish, plants and trees. <ref name="geo"/>Thin coal seams and oil shales transpire in the Deer Lake Basin, and evaporites (gypsum, potash and salt) as well as coal and oil, occur in the St. George's Bay Basin. <ref name="geo"/>
    
==History==
{{Main|History of Newfoundland and Labrador}}
St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador is one of the oldest European settlements of North America.<ref name="def">{{cite web|url=http://www.tidespoint.com/stjohnsnewfoundland.shtml|title=St. John's History|accessdate=2006-11-23}}</ref> St. John's serves as a [[seaport]] town located on the eastern edge of the Atlantic Ocean. <ref name="def"/> It is a place of wooden row houses imposing churches and trees, walking trails and lakes, with modern buildings and industries.<ref name="def"/>

St. John's Newfoundland and Labrador specifically is the oldest European settlement in North America, when it was founded on the feast of St. John the Baptist on [[June 24]], [[1497]]. [[John Cabot]], an Italian navigator sailed under English flag, becoming the first European since the [[Vikings]] to have been verifiably known as to have reached mainland America.<ref name="def"/> <ref name="deg"/> The 500th anniversary to which Cabot named New Founded Landed was celebrated in 1997.<ref name="def"/> St. John's went on to become the oldest [[Great Britain|British]] colony in North America, as in [[August 5]]], [[1583]], Sir Humphrey Gilbert took possession of the region for England. Between [[France]] and [[England]], the settlement changed hands several times, until it was permanently British in [[1762]] and served as a naval base in the American Revolutionary War and the [[War of 1812]]. 

Many of St. John's first settlers derived from the southeast of Ireland, mainly [[Waterford]], [[Wexford]] and [[Kilkenny]], which proves the similarity of accents in that part of Ireland and Newfoundland.<ref name="def"/>

The most unfortunate disaster of St. John's occurred on [[July 8]], [[1892]] and has developed the common name of The Great Fire of 1892.<ref name="def"/> Following up this event, there was another major event that started in the same neighborhood on [[December 21]], [[1992]]. This one destroyed more than a dozens of businesses and ruined numerous houses.<ref name="def"/> 

The first Transatlantic message was received by [[Guglielmo Marconi]] at St. John's and it was made from there that the first non-stop transatlantic flight in 1919 was made by Alcock and Brown.<ref name="def"/>

During [[World War 2]], this harbor was used by the [[Royal Navy]] and [[Royal Canadian Navy]] ships used for protecting convoys.<ref name="def"/> It as well was the site of a large US Army base called "Fort Pepperell." And this base was established as part of the "Lend-lease" agreement of the United Kingdom and United States.<ref name="def"/>

==Regions==
On the structure of the island, it can be subdivided into six regions.<ref name="abc"/> The main plateau in the south is called by [[Snelgrove]] the "Atlantic upland". This consists mainly of moss-barrens, where the three main rivers rise.<ref name="abc"/> Just as the rest of the surface is corrugated it is the result of the erosion of folded rocks.<ref name="abc"/> Exploits which is the longest river flows into [[Red Indian Lake]] and enters Notre Dame Bay. The Gander River is linked to the lake of the same name, and enters the eastern area of the Notre Dame bay. The Next division is the Long Range Plateau that extends to the south as the [[Lewis hills]]. In the latter is the highest point of the plateau which is 2,673 feet.<ref name="abc"/> Gros Morne, 100 miles to the northeast is nearly the same height. The Avalon Peninsula can be considered the third division. Though it is really part of the main plateau, it is separated by [[Placentia]] and [[Trinity bays]]. A remarkably long, high, and narrow isthmus (called the [[Rantem]]) bounds the two divisions.<ref name="abc"/> The latter three regions are the lowlands. Snelgrove names one "Notre Dame Basin" and includes one of the timber lands of the Exploits River, and the Buchans mining area.<ref name="abc"/> The fifth region is the White Bay graben, which includes its much younger rocks.<ref name="abc"/> It contains Grand Lake and Deer Lake with the large hydroelectric station at the east end of Deer Lake. The Humber River drains both these lakes and then turns west into a wide gorge (1,500 feet deep) and reaches the sea at [[Corner Brook]]. The small graben at Codroy in the extreme south-west is barely large enough to be constituted as a region; though it includes many of the agricultural land of the island.<ref name="abc"/> 

==Newfoundland Climate and Vegetation==
The island has a [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] climate very much modified by the cold Labrador Current, which sweeps down the east coast and then goes to the west along the south coast.<ref name="abc"/> <ref name="cde"/> It keeps the summer cool, and also lowers the winter temperatures. Thus the range of mean temperatures at St. John's is 36 degrees Fahrenheit, from 59° in July to 23° in January.<ref name="abc"/> At Corner Brook the range is 44 degrees, which is high for a marine station.<ref name="abc"/> Come January, the entire island, is below freezing point, and also in summers snow is found in places on the elevated plateau.<ref name="abc"/> For most of July, the island is about 57° or higher.<ref name="abc"/> The warmest region (61°F.), however is in the west in the vicinity of Corner Brook.<ref name="abc"/><ref name="cde"/> Rain fall which is adequate, ranges from 30 inches in the north-west to 60 inches on the south coast. A very heavy snowfall that is over 120 inches is found in the northeast of the island, disouted only by that north of the city of Quebec. Fogs are very prevalent on the southeast coasts. 

Newfoundland has few weather stations, though climate can be determined by natural vegetation.<ref name="abc"/> Nearly half of the area is forests, though much of the land of the south and west consists of "moss barrens". In accord with the temperature, ash and elm are confined to the warmer south-west valleys, white yellow birch and white pine that are common in the centre and west. Balsam fir and black spruce are found to be general nearly everywhere in the lower lands except in the northeast, in which aspen and paper birch stand the cold climate better.

===St. John's Climate===
Of all the major Canadian cities, St. John's is the foggiest(124 days, next to Halifax's 122), snowiest (359 cm, next to Quebec City's 343), wettest (1514 mm, next to Halifax's 1491), windiest (24.3 km/h average speed, next to Regina's 20.7), and cloudiest (1497 hours of sunshine, next to Charlottetown's 1818 hours.<ref name="ghi">{{cite web|url=http://homeschooling.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?zi=1/XJ&sdn=homeschooling&zu=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ns.ec.gc.ca%2Fclimate%2Fnfld.html|title=About everything in Newfoundland and Labrador|accessdate=2006-11-23}}</ref> More than any other city, it has the most freezing rain days and wet weather. <ref name="ghi"/> However, the people of St. John's tend to appreciate the wet days.<ref name="ghi"/> In one instance, they have boasted that their city happens to have one of the mildest winters in Canada (third mildest city next to Victoria and Vancouver).<ref name="ghi"/>

===Relation to the sea===
It is believed that the Newfoundlanders live on, by and from the sea.<ref name="ghi"/>  Since it is more than 100km from the ocean, it receives many influences in weather. Surface water temperatures on the Atlantic side range from summer highs of 11 to 13C inshore and 8 to 11C offshore to winter lows of -1 C inshore and +2C offshore. Sea temperatures on the Gulf side are warmer than Atlantic by a 1 to 3C. The sea keeps winter temperatures slightly higher and summer a little lower on the coast than at places inland. The marine climate makes generally more changeable weather, ample precipitation in a variety of forms, greater humidity, lower visibility, more clouds, less sunshine, and higher winds than a continental climate.<ref name="ghi"/>

===Storms===
Ample amounts of heavy precipitation, low clouds, and strong winds are the cause of a number of storms over the pass years.<ref name="ghi"/>  Many storms, which cross North America during the year from east to west or develop and intensify off the East Coast of the United States, pass near the island while they move out to the North Atlantic.<ref name="ghi"/> This results in the reputation of devastating storms in Newfoundland.<ref name="ghi"/>  The frequency and severity of storms is greatest between November and March, although they may occur at any time of the year.<ref name="ghi"/> 

Winter cyclones are quick-moving storms (up to 80 km/h) that bring abundant and varied [[precipitation]]. They serve as a threat to anglers, commercial shipping, and offshore gas and oil exploitation activities. Winds frequently mount to gale (about 3 or 4 in the winter) and hurricane force.

Occasionally, throughout the year, the mature [[cyclones]] are stopped from moving throughout the region. The resulting cool, cloudy, and rainy water is associated with the system may persist for a week or more.

From the summer, to early fall, Newfoundland is mainly less stormy.<ref name="ghi"/>  However, in the fall, tropical storms swarmed the near equator and developed in the Caribbean may bring windy, wet weather while they pass by the island before dying or redeveloping in the North Atlantic.<ref name="ghi"/>  Over the past 35 years, an average of one tropical storm each year has passed within 300km of Newfoundland.<ref name="ghi"/>  "One of the most notorious of these was the "Independence Hurricane" that struck eastern Newfoundland on September 9, 1775. About 4000 sailors, mostly from the British Isles, were reported to have been drowned." "As well as on [[September 5]], [[1978]], another violent storm, Hurricane Ella, passed south of Cape Race. Its winds outreached 220 km/h. At St. John's, 45 mm of rain fell and winds reached 115 km/h."<ref name="ghi"/> 
  
===Winds===
Newfoundland has the strongest winds of any of the provinces, with most stations reporting an average annual wind speeds more than 20km/h.<ref name="ghi"/>  Usually coastal stations have stronger winds than inland stations; valley's have lighter winds than elevated terrains, and winter is windier than the summer. [[Botanist]] on the East Coast is the windiest location, that has an average annual wind speed of 28 km/h, St. Albans, in the sheltered Bay despair on the south coast, is the least windy location, with an average yearly speed of 11.5 km/h.<ref name="ghi"/> 

Winds are dominated by the west year round, but variations are common both from location to another and from month to month.<ref name="ghi"/>  Prevailing wind directions are in winter and west-southwest in summer. Calm and variable weather conditions occur about 2 to 3% of the time along the coast. While 10% of the time it is at inland stations.

===Ocean Air===
Temperatures of Newfoundland tend to be neutral midway between those of [[Winnipeg]] and [[Vancouver]].<ref name="ghi"/>  The temperature of Newfoundland (the difference between the average temperatures of the warmest and coldest months) is 20C. By comparison, Winnipeg's is 38.9 and Vancouver's is 14.8.<ref name="ghi"/> 

Winter temperatures of Newfoundland show day-to-day variability that is characteristic of a stormy maritime climate.<ref name="ghi"/>  What's more, incursions of moist, mild Atlantic air are frequent. There is also a notice. In the interior, winter temperatures average between 6C and -10C, where as on the southeast coast, where the moderating influence of the ocean is greatest, the winter average is between -2C and -4C.<ref name="ghi"/>  The lowest Newfoundland temperature was on record is -41.1C, and was set at [[Wooddale Bishop's fall]] on [[February 4]], [[1975]].

Springs comes rather slowly, and is short. Until late May, night-time averages in the interior are below 4C, and in many valley locations there is a 90% likeliness of frost on any given night until the first week of June.<ref name="ghi"/> 

Summer is well is short and cool. The glacial Labrador Current holds July average temperatures in coastal areas near 14C, but inland averages can go over 16C. Sunny summer days in Newfoundland are amongst the best of anywhere in Canada.<ref name="ghi"/>  With afternoon’s highs in the low twenties, it is warm enough to be cool and comfortable and cool enough to permit vigorous activity. The summer of 1987 was especially pleasant across central Newfoundland. The record high sunshine, scanty rain, and seasonable temperatures satisfied most tourists and residents. The highest temperature ever recorded on Newfoundland is 36.7 occurring at Botwood, northeast of Grand Falls, on [[August 22]], [[1976]].<ref name="ghi"/> 

The frost-free period changes vastly. Typical growing seasons lengths are about 150 days on the south coast 125 on the Avalon Peninsula, and under 100 days in the interior.<ref name="ghi"/>  In other locations, in which the landscape causes cold air to collect at night, frost-free durations may be only 70 days on average.<ref name="ghi"/>  The growing season in the interior of Newfoundland tends to start around June 8 and to end by September 15. Usually, frost is not a limiting variable for root vegetables growth (such as potatoes and turnips), which are the most significant of the few crops grown in Newfoundland.

===Rain storms===
Freezing rainstorms are a chief hazard in various parts of Canada, though in Newfoundland they are more frequent. <ref name="ghi"/> They are nicknamed known as Silver thaws.<ref name="ghi"/>  Some of these thaws can be very severe causing external damage, and bringing transportation and other essential activities to a stand still. One of the worst storms ever on the island was one that struck St. John's on the evening of [[April 11]], [[1984]] and continued intermittently until the 14th. Huge collections of ice covered almost 15 cm thick formed on over- head wires. The interference of power supplies left 200 000 people in the Avalon Peninsula heatless and light for days, resulting in a run of [[kerosene]] heaters at [[retail stores]].<ref name="ghi"/> 

The land between St. John's and Gander is especially prone to prolonged periods of freezing precipitation that last for several hours or intermittently for 2 or more days, interrupting  daily activities and destroying trees and property.<ref name="ghi"/> Freezing drizzle or freezing rain occurs on average of 150 hours each winter, and March is its worst month.

===Sunshine===
Newfoundland is known for its sunshine. The total amount of hours for the bright sunshine is less than 1600 hours per year, which is lower than summer side’s average of 1959 hours, Calgary's 2314 hours, and the Canadian average of 1925 hours.<ref name="ghi"/>  The summer months are the sunniest, with an average of 187 hours a month, about 42% of the total possible. The lowest sunshine is seen in December when the average during daily reaches 2 hours.

The waters off the Avalon Peninsula and over the [[Grand Banks]] are among the foggiest in the world. The fogs also known as "sea smoke" develop as the result of warm air from the south strikes the cold, sometimes ice-infested, waters of the Labrador Current.<ref name="ghi"/>  These fogs can occur in all seasons, but on average, they are most often in the spring and early summer when the contrast between sea and air temperatures is greatest, in anywhere between 5C and 15C. [[Argentia]] has 206 days of fog, Belle Isle and Cape Race have over 160, and St. Lawrence on the Burin Peninsula 147.   

The Fogs, surprisingly are frequently accompanied by strong winds. Usually winds can be expected to disperse fog. Though here the fog it too dense and widespread winds clearly are ineffective. The resulting conditions can be hazardous for shipping and for dripping especially when icebergs are present.

===Floes and Wintry Ghosts===
In the first half of each year the waters off Newfoundland can become choked by ice floes and icebergs.<ref name="ghi"/>  The severity of ice varies relatively, depending on the strength and the vector of direction of the wind and the coldness from the air.<ref name="ghi"/>  In a common year, ice enters the [[Strait of Belle Isle]] by the start of January. The ice edge usually reaches Notre Dame Bay by the end of the month and Cape Freels in the middle of February. By the west side, Labrador ice goes into the Gulf of St. Lawrence through the Strait of Belle Isle; yet the vast majority of the ice is made in the Gulf itself and the estuary. The ice edge is at its maximum southern extent by March, and fills the several bays and coves.

By April, the rate of melting overtakes the southward ice drift and the pack slowly returns. Usually by mid-month, navigation via the Strait of Belle Isle is possible.<ref name="ghi"/>  In mid-June the median ice edge returns to the mid-Labrador [[coast]]. In extreme years, ice, can linger south of Belle Isle after [[Canada Day]].

Every year, an average of 250 icebergs drifts along in the cold waters of the Labrador Current on the Grand Banks.<ref name="ghi"/>  Icebergs have been accumulated and tracked since the sinking of the Titanic in 1912. Although 250 is an average number, the yearly extremes have ranged from none in 1966 to 2202 in 1984, an eighteen year difference.<ref name="ghi"/> 

==Time zones==
Newfoundland is located in a unique [[time zone]] in North America.<ref name="cde"/> It is a half an hour later than Atlantic Time, one and a half hours later than Central Canada and 4 ½ hours later than the west coast of the country.<ref name="cde"/> It is also the only place in Canada with split variations of l hour between time zones. <ref name="cde"/>

==Labrador Climate and vegetation==
The climate of Labrador is more [[Arctic]] than [[Atlantic]] and is between rigid and stimulating..<ref name="jkl">{{cite web|url=http://atlantic-web1.ns.ec.gc.ca/climatecentre/default.asp?lang=En&n=02ECF58A-1|title=The climate of Labrador is more [[Arctic]] than [[Atlantic]] and is between rigid and stimulating|accessdate=2007-02-04}}</ref>  Defined by rugged rocks, a bleaked forded coast, and a  mainly uncharted interior, Labrador is one of Canada’s most dreary regions of Canada. <ref name="jkl"/> Lying on the eastern side of the continent, Labrador sees major seasonal disparity in movement and characteristics of air masses.<ref name="jkl"/>   Predominantly the flow is off-land. <ref name="jkl"/> The rugged [[Torngat Mountains]] in the north, which peaks above 1500 m, and the [[Mealy Mountains]] of the south, that peaks about 1200 m, control the influence moderating in the Atlantic Ocean to the rocky islands and near shore.<ref name="jkl"/> 

For the reason that ocean influence negatively affects Labrador’s climate, it is not a major climatical disadvantage. <ref name="jkl"/> The labor sea is scattered with floating pack ice and [[icebergs]] for eight months of the year.<ref name="jkl"/>   The collections of ice keep sea temperatures below 4C. A wind off the east of Labrador’s [[current]] is cool in the [[summer]], usually with [[drizzle]] or ’’light rain’’. In winter, when Atlantic weather is generally mild, the associated weather conditions are [[cloud]]s  and frequent snow flurries.<ref name="jkl"/>  Widespread [[fog]] occurs, whenever easterly winds carry high winds to the Atlantic. 

===Temperature===
Winters are bitterly cold; a typical daytime temperature for January is between 10 and -15C, colder than Newfoundland’s and more as the iciness of the southern Prairies.<ref name="jkl"/>  An occasional storming of Atlantic air warms up in the winter. The summer season in comparison is short and cool,  along the coast of the cold Labrador current. <ref name="jkl"/> The July average temperatures are from to 10C down the coast but are three to 5C warmer in the interior. The duration of pleasant sunshine often relies on the wind direction, westerly winds convey clear, mild continental air, whereby easterlies, blowing off the Labrador Current, carry cold, cloudy, and moist weather. <ref name="jkl"/> 

===Precipitation===
Precipitation in the south weighs more on climate than in the north.<ref name="jkl"/>  Generally it is much lighter than in Newfoundland,  although amounts can vary all throughout the year. <ref name="jkl"/> Unlike the moist northern [[shore]]s in Newfoundland with a 1000m, Labrador has a year fall of precipitation.<ref name="jkl"/>  Snow is nearly have the precipitation at 45%. The majority of Labrador-- 800 mm is more a typical amount--with about half of it as snow. In summer, rainfall is relatively consistent, having seasonal totals seldom fewer than 175 mm in the north and 275 mm in the south.<ref name="jkl"/>   [[Snowfall]] is weighty, especially with [[Churchill Falls]] in the interior having 481 cm, making it one of the snowiest areas in Canada.<ref name="jkl"/>  [[Goose Bay]], in addition has a stern snowfall of 445 cm. In the south, [[Cartwright]], averages 440 cm, and in the north [[Nain]] typically averages 424 cm. The ground is covered in snow for six months in the north and eight months in the south.<ref name="jkl"/> 

==Hydrography==

===Icebergs and icecaps===

In the [[North Atlantic]], the majority of icebergs derive from about 100 iceberg-producing glaciers in [[Greenland]] coast, concurrently few icebergs generate in the Eastern Canadian Arctic Islands. <ref name="hyd">{{cite web|url=http://www.wordplay.com/tourism/icebergs/|title=In the [[North Atlantic]] the majority of icebergs derive from about 100 iceberg producing glaciers in [[Greenland]] coast, concurrently few icebergs generate in the Eastern Canadian Arctic Islands |accessdate=2007-02-24}}</ref>  Amongst the fastest in the world are the western glaciers of Newfoundland (90 percent from Newfoundland), up to 7km per year. <ref name="hyd"/> Those icebergs are seen off the [[Labrador Current]].  Glaciers are resulted by an accrual  of snow thousands of years ago. <ref name="hyd"/> When ongoing layers of snow condense earlier buildup until, at depths below 60 to 70 meters, glacial ice forms. If the edge of the water runs into the ocean , the pieces that break off create icebergs.  About 40,000 medium to large sized icebergs annually calve in Greenland--- and about 1 to 2% (400-800) of these go as far south as 48o north latitude (St. John's).  The accounts change notably each year, seasonally when it comes to the [[spring]] and early summer of Newfoundland.<ref name="hyd"/>  Icebergs off the coast of Newfoundland perhaps calved from a glacier the year ago. Often they spend  a year or more, slowly melting in cold arctic bays unto they’ve passed [[ Davis Strait]] and into the Labrador current, bur seldom last for a year. Occasionally when icebergs deteriorate, they travel thousands of kilometers. From 75 degrees north latitude in [[Baffin Bay]], an iceberg can travel up to 4,000 km south to around 40° north latitude (800 km south of St. John's). Also, in [[Bermuda]] and Ireland, particularly unusual movements have occurred well outside of this normal limit.
  
The average drift speed of icebergs that reach the east coast of Newfoundland  is around 0.2 m/s (0.7km/h).<ref name="hyd"/>  Speeds more than 1 m/s (3.6 km/h) are observed, as having stationary non-grounded bergs. The drift speed of icebergs is interpreted iceberg size and shape, currents, waves and wind. The icebergs on the east coast of Newfoundland and Labrador vary in mass and size due to deterioration , (in immense tabular and blocky bergs) , accumulating to several million tonnes to ones weighing 1% of this. <ref name="hyd"/> According the category of iceberg sizes there are large, small, medium, and very large (larger than 10 million tonnes and hundreds of meters long) and very big  “growlers“, which sized as pianos. Other terms for iceberg shape are wedge, dome, pinnacle, and drydock.<ref name="hyd"/>  Tabular bergs are most controllable, but domed and lodged will roll unexplainably in seconds. <ref name="hyd"/> 

The average iceberg weight in the Grand Banks area is nearly one to two hundred thousand tonnes (about the size of a cubic 15-story building). <ref name="hyd"/> The interior temperature of icebergs in Newfoundland and Labrador range to  -15o to -20o C.<ref name="hyd"/>  Merely at the surface the temperature increase to 0o C (melting point). Note that in warm water than cold water, the icebergs appear colder, because the melting steepens the internal temperature incline exposing the cold interior.<ref name="hyd"/> 

The icebergs are usually white being fully made of tiny ice bubbles, which reflect  white light giving the icebergs a white appearance. However, non-bubblish ’bergs can have a bluish tint that off the sky.  The bluish line of clear, bubble free ice usually seen in icebergs results from the refreezing of melt water that fills crevasses in the glacier when it comes over land. This ice is blue by the natural light reflected by nature of pure ice. Pure ice comes from fallen snow that comes from condensed [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere, creating this pure ice.  Icebergs derive simply from pure fresh water, but some dust comes into the salt and ice water but does not regularly change the freshness  But when dirt or slush and volcanic eruptions or winds mesh with the pure ice on the ice it turns into a darkened brown/gray color. 

Incase of iceberg danger, signs of it include colored streaks, [[cave]]s and [[tunnel]]s, old and new waterline notches, objects such as [[boulder]]s or birds and the sound of rolling and calving icebergs. <ref name="hyd"/> Ice can be dangerous for climbers and can be catastrophic if it starts to fall. Starting in 1971, iceberg towing is a common practice. <ref name="hyd"/> With massive icebergs can be tough because of their rigidity. The process is that a  vessel navigates while paying out a floating towline. A junction lassoes the berg and then tow tension is applied carefully to avoid the berg rolling or pulling the line over the top. 

The largest Newfoundland iceberg accounted in near Baffin Island in 1882. <ref name="hyd"/> It had a size of 13km long, 6km wide, and a freeboard size of 20m.<ref name="hyd"/>  It weighted about 9 billion tonnes (which would be year supply of water), but ones in Antarctica have way greater sizes.

====Tsunamis, Cyclones and Earthquakes====

One of Newfoundland’s worst Natural disasters hit  at 017:02 Newfoundland time on November 18, 1929 when an earthquake struck off the coast of the [[Grand Banks]], Newfoundland. <ref name="tce">{{cite web|url=http://www.geophys.washington.edu/tsunami/general/historic/grandbanks29.html|title=Earth Tsunami was surely a landslide |accessdate=2007-02-10}}</ref>  As well, a [[tsunami]] was caused by a sub-marine [[landslide]] and the earthquake, having a Richter magnitude of 7.2 with an epicenter of 44.5°N, 56.3°W. <ref name="tce"/> Greater of its damage, was that it caused $400, 000 in damage and 29 people 
were killed, altogether it had the highest death toll by an earthquake in Canada. <ref name="tce"/> The most harmful factor of the event was the sub-marine landslide.<ref name="tce"/>  It added to size of the tsunami, damaging large kilometers of 12 transatlantic telegraph cables. <ref name="tce"/> Much of the monetary was used to pay for the tsunami damage went to repair costs of the transatlantic cables. <ref name="tce"/> 

By 1952, American Scientists decided  to compose the scattered parts of the cable that leads to the exposure of the landslide and the first records of a turbidity current.<ref name="tce"/>  Scientists examined deposits of land thought to have been dumped by other tsunamis in order to determine the occurrence rates for large earthquakes.<ref name="tce"/>  One layer of sand believed to be from the 1929 tsunami, at [[Taylor's Bay]] was found 13 cm below the [[turf]] line.<ref name="tce"/>  The rate of large tsunamis, like the one in 1929, are attributed by the deposition  of offshore [[sediment]]s, in the same way the landslide made the tsunami so destructive.  <ref name="tce"/> 
    
==Industry and Economy==

The island's main industries are [[timber]], [[fish]], and [[minerals]]. In 1944, the relative values of these three industries were 44, 18, and 8 million dollars. Agriculture serves as a smaller sector. The principal farming areas are on the Avalon Peninsula, near Bishop's Falls, along the Codroy valley, and to the northwest of Deer Lake. Mining has been carried on in numerous parts of the island, but in two large fields; Buchanan and [[Waban]] are in operation present.

Cod fishing which accounts for ¾ of all fishing made is carried on the inshore fishery, which is based on various villages scattered around the coasts and the Newfoundland banks. The banks are larger areas on sea floor (equaling the area of Newfoundland today) which lie to the southeast of the island beneath a shallow cover of ocean water. They are washed by the Labrador Current, and carry large supplies of [[halibut]], [[haddock]], and [[herring]], including as well cod. Herring are taken mainly in the bays, often near Corner Brook. Salmon are captured during the summer off the east coast, whilst lobsters are numerous in the shallow water close to the north-west coast. 

The timber and paper industry, that accounts for approximately one-half of the island's exports, in value, is carried on by two large companies whom hold extensive limits along the coasts and river valleys. 

Also important to Newfoundland’s commerce is rocks.<ref name="geo"/>  Carbonate rocks housing the [[zinc]] [[mine]] at Daniel’s Harbour, (closed in 1990), which are the source of limestone for the cement making in Corner Brook shows the value of the rocks.<ref name="geo"/> The ophiolites complexes contain copper like minerals once held  at [[York Harbour]] in the [[Bay of Islands]].  As well, they contain [[chromite]] and [[asbestos]] prospects in the [[Lewis Hills]]. [[Gypsum]] at [[Flat Bay]] and the potash and salt deposits of St. George’s Bay basing long to the island’s future commerce.<ref name="geo"/> During the early days of the [[Newfoundland Railway]], Coal was mined near Howley and Robinsons.  In both Deer Lake and St. George's Bay Basins, exploration of [[Uranium]] has occurred, but deposits have yet to be found. Although on the west coast since the early 1800s, onshore oil and gas seepages have been known. <ref name="geo"/>Around 50 [[well]]s have been bore over the past century and about ½ shows anecdotal indications of [[hydrocarbon]]s. <ref name="geo"/>In the early 1980s, the government of Newfoundland and Labrador arranged half a million acres of the west coast to be available for oil and gas exploration. <ref name="geo"/>Therefore, there is a chance that the Iapetus may generate activity rivaling what is the current offshore continental margin of the Atlantic. <ref name="geo"/>


==Population==

The pattern of the settlement up until 1896 as the railway was completed was unique for such a huge island. Each village lied on the rugged coast, where there was very few or no area communication exempt to the Avalon. <ref name="abc"/> Despite that, numerous harbors were available, which meant all communication was done by sea. <ref name="abc"/> It is still a case with the majority of the settlements, which make a continuous fringe of little villages around the coast. <ref name="abc"/>

'''Social Conventions'''
:Newfoundland shows dominant influence in northern European specifically English and Irish, as well as [[French]] (settlers in dialects of dance and folk music). Aboriginal peoples with diverse cultures and customs include the [[Milkman]] on Newfoundland and the [[Inuit]], [[Innu]] and [[Métis]] in [[Labrador]]. Geographical distinction has nurtured an independent spirit in the province,  which had joined the [[Canadian union]] in 1949.

''"A Meteorological Moment
Early Monday morning on February 15, 1982, the giant drilling rig Ocean Ranger capsized and sank on the Grand Banks, 300 km east of St. John's. The entire 84- man crew perished in the violent winter seas, marking the worst Canadian marine disaster in decades. It was the world's second worst catastrophe in offshore drilling history, next to the North Sea tragedy on March 22, 1980, when 123 died.''"
