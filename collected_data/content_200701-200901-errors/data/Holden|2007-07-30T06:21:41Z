'''Holden''', officially '''GM Holden Ltd''' is an [[Australia]]n [[automaker]] based in [[Port Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], originally independent but now a subsidiary of [[General Motors]] (GM).<ref name = "profile">{{cite web | url = http://www.holden.com.au/www-holden/jsp/corporateinfo/companyprofile/companyprofile.jsp | title = Holden: Company Profile | publisher = GM Holden Ltd | accessdate = 2007-05-27}}</ref> The automotive marque is one of GM's "alpha" brands, taking charge of vehicle operations for General Motors in [[Australasia]], and on behalf on GM hold partial ownership of [[GM Daewoo]] in [[South Korea]].<ref>{{cite web | date = [[2005-02-01]] | url = http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=9144&vf=1 | title = Spanner in the works | publisher = [[The Sun-Herald]] | accessdate = 2007-07-07}}</ref>

Over the years, Holden has offered a broad range of vehicles. The vast majority of such being locally produced, with supplementary models sourced from various parts of the General Motors empire. Some of these cars have been assembled locally; others have been imported. In the past, Holden has offered rebadged [[Nissan]] and [[Toyota]] models in sharing arrangements.<ref name = "milestones">{{cite web | url = http://media.gm.com/aus/holden/en/company/history/history_milestones.html | title = Holden Company Milestones | publisher = [[General Motors]] | accessdate = 2007-05-19}}</ref> 

Holden cars are manufactured at [[Elizabeth, South Australia]], while engines are produced at [[Port Melbourne, Victoria]].<ref name = "profile"/> Historically, production or assembly plants were operated in all mainland [[States and territories of Australia|states of Australia]], including [[Woodville, South Australia]] (body production only) [[Pagewood, New South Wales]], [[Dandenong, Victoria]], [[Acacia Ridge, Queensland]] and [[Mosman Park, Western Australia]]. Consolidation of all car production at Elizabeth, South Australia was completed in 1988, although some assembly operations continued at Dandenong until the mid-1990s.<ref name = "milestones"/> Since 1926, the [[Holden New Zealand]] subsidiary operated an assembly plant based in [[Petone]], [[New Zealand]]. However, manufacturing operations ceased after an announcement made on [[April 26]] [[1990]] to phase out local production, and import vehicles [[Duty (economics)|duty]] free.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.holden.co.nz/heart/heritage/ | title = Heart of Holden - Holden Heritage | publisher = [[Holden New Zealand]] | accessdate = 2007-05-27}}</ref>

== History of the marque ==
=== Early history ===
In 1852 James Alexander Holden immigrated to [[South Australia]] from [[England]], and established '''J.A Holden & Co''' in 1856, a saddlery business in [[Adelaide]].<ref name = "heritage1">{{cite web | last = Kennedy | first = Alistair | coauthors = Kennedy, Ewan; Davis, Tony | url = http://media.gmcanada.com:8221/aus/holden/en/company/history/HH13Part1.pdf | title = The Holden Heritage - 13th Edition, part one | publisher = GM Holden Ltd | accessdate = 2007-05-09}}</ref> [[Edward Holden]], James' son, entered the firm in 1905, with a genuine interest in automobiles.<ref>{{cite web | last = Hancock | first = Joan | coauthors = Richards, Eric | url = http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A090705b.htm | title = Holden, Sir Edward Wheewall (1885 - 1947) | publisher = Australian Dictionary of Biography | accessdate = 2007-05-18}}</ref> From there, the firm evolved through various partnerships and in 1908, as Holden and Frost, moved into the business of minor repairs to car upholstery.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/history_holden.htm | title = Holden History | publisher = Unique Cars & Parts | accessdate = 2007-06-12}}</ref> The company began producing complete motorcycle sidecar bodies from 1913, and Edward experimented with fitting bodies on different types of carriages.<ref name = "milestones"/> After 1917, wartime trade restrictions led the company to commence full-scale production of vehicle body shells.

J.A Holden incorporated a new company in 1919, '''Holden's Motor Body Builders Ltd''' (HMBB).<ref name = "heritage1"/> HMBB made bodies to suit a number of [[chassis]] imported from different manufacturers, such as [[Buick]] and [[Dodge]].<ref name = "milestones"/> Then in 1931 General Motors purchased the business and formed '''General Motors–Holden's Ltd'''.<ref name = "heritage1"/> Since then two name changes have occurred, the first being in 1998 when it was renamed '''Holden Ltd''', and then in May 2005 when it became officially known as '''GM Holden Ltd'''.<ref name = "heritage1"/>

=== Australia's own car ===
[[Image:48-215 launch.jpg|thumb|Launch of the first Holden in November 1948 by Prime Minister [[Ben Chifley]].]]
After the end of [[World War II]], the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] took steps to encourage an Australian automotive industry.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.holden.com.au/www-holden/jsp/corporateinfo/history/chifley.jsp | title = The Birth of 'Australia's Own Car' | publisher = GM Holden Ltd | accessdate = 2007-06-12}}</ref> While it is widely accepted that General Motors was the only automobile manufacturer to accept the challenge to build "Australia's Own Car", both [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and General Motors provided studies to the Australian Government of the day. Ford's long and complex document listed the impact and employment effects of a Ford based vehicle and associated infrastructure, whereas GM's was a simple three page list, showing each member of parliament and what each member would receive in "financial aid".<ref name = "NAA">{{cite web | url = http://www.naa.gov.au/The_Collection/transport/road.html | title = Road transport | publisher = [[National Archives of Australia]] | accessdate = 2007-06-12}}</ref>

Holden's managing director [[Laurence Hartnett]] was particularly enthusiastic about developing and building an Australian car. This led to the development of the [[Holden 48-215|48-215]] (also unofficially called the FX), which was launched in 1948. The [[Mid-size car|mid-size]] 48-215 was fitted with a 132.5&nbsp;[[cubic inch]] (2171&nbsp;cc) engine,<ref name = "heritage1"/> and its design was based on a rejected post war [[Chevrolet]] proposal.<ref name = "drive">{{Cite web | last = Morley | first = David | date = [[2004-10-14]] | url = http://www.drive.com.au/buy/TopTen/ChangedTheWorld.aspx | title = 10 cars that changed the world | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | accessdate = 2007-06-12}}</ref> General Motors rejected the design because the size it was deemed being too small for the [[United States]] market.

=== 1950s: domination of the Australian market ===
During the 1950s, Holden dominated the Australian marketplace, offering buyers a unique combination of style, comfort, performance, economy, and value for money that no competitor could match.<ref name = "NAA"/><ref name = "heritage1"/> Less expensive four-cylinder cars did not offer Holden's rugged ability in country areas.<ref name = "NAA"/> Another factor in Holden's success, was the large investment in production capacity, which allowed Holden to take advantage of post-war demand for motor cars.<ref name = "milestones"/> [[Holden 48-215|48-215]] [[sedan]]s were produced in parallel with the [[Holden 50-2106|50-2106]] [[coupe utility]] from 1951, which became known [[Colloquialism|colloquially]] as the "[[Holden Ute]]", which became a ubiquitous sight in Australian [[rural]] areas, as the workhorse of choice for a generation of primary producers. Production continued with minor running changes until 1953, when it was replaced by the facelifted [[Holden FJ|FJ]] model.<ref name = "ute">{{cite web | date = [[2001-04-24]] | url = http://www.autoweb.com.au/cms/newsarticle.html?&start=70&showall=&id=HOL&doc=gmh0104242 | title = An Aussie Icon Turns 50 - The Holden Ute: 1951 - 2001 | publisher = Web Publications Pty Limited | accessdate = 2007-05-30}}</ref>

The FJ was the first major change to the Holden since its 1948 introduction. Over time it gained an iconic status, and remains one of Australia's most recognisable automotive symbols.<ref name = "heritage1"/> A new horizontally slatted radiator grille dominated the front-end of the FJ, along with other trim changes, although no changes were made to the body panels.<ref name = "heritage1"/> Holden paid homage to the FJ, with the [[Holden Efijy|Efijy]] [[concept car]] at the 2005 [[Australian International Motor Show]] in [[Sydney]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rsportscars.com/eng/cars/holden_efijy.asp | title = 2005 Holden Efijy Concept | publisher = RSportsCars.com | accessdate = 2007-05-30}}</ref>

[[Image:Millionth Holden.JPG|thumb|left|The millionth Holden (an EJ) comes off the line at [[Dandenong, Victoria]] on [[October 25]] [[1962]].]]

While the FJ was little changed from the 48-215, shrewd marketing, including strategic price cuts kept vehicle sales steady, until a completely redesigned model—the FE was launched in 1956. Mechanical components carried over from the FJ, but the contemporary appearance was all-new. This time round, the car was offered as a [[station wagon]] as well as a sedan. Strong sales continued, with Holden achieving a remarkable feat of over 50% market share.<ref name = "ute"/>

=== 1960s: response to the challenge of competition ===
The 1960s marked a time of change for Holden. For the first time, they faced serious competition, as their major competitors finally sourced cars from overseas and built at production capacity, allowing them to make a serious challenge to Holden's dominance. The decade opened with Holden offering their third major new model, the FB. Styling was inspired by 1957 Chevrolets, with [[tailfin]]s and a wrap around [[windshield]] with "dog leg" [[Pillar (car)|A-pillars]]. By the time Holden introduced the FB in 1960, many considered the appearance to be dated, as it was based on a three-year-old Chevrolet design. Much of the motoring industry at the time noted that the adopted styling did not translate well to the more compact Holden. The FB became the first Holden adapted for [[Driving on the left or right|left-hand drive]] markets, enhancing its export potential.<ref name = "heritage1"/>

In 1960, [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] unveiled the new [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Falcon]] to the Australian market. This came only months after its introduction in the [[United States]], and only soon after Holden introduced the FB. In terms of styling, the Falcon's headlights were incorporated into the radiator grille, and there was the availability of [[automatic transmission]]. To Holden's advantage, the Falcon suffered from serious durability weaknesses, particularly in the front suspension, which Holden soon exploited. Early tests reinforced that the car was not well suited for [[Environment of Australia|Australian conditions]], and Falcon customers discovered the same problems.<ref>{{Cite web | last = Mercer | first = Sandy | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_ford_falcon_xk.htm | title = Ford Falcon XK | publisher = Unique Cars & Parts | accessdate = 2007-06-28}}</ref>

In response to the Falcon, Holden introduced the facelifted EK in 1961, featuring two-tone paintwork, chrome trim,<ref name = "heritage1"/> and the welcomed availability of automatic transmission. The EH, premiering in 1963, featured the new [[Holden Red motor|Red motor]], which improved vehicle performance over the previous [[Holden Grey motor|Grey motor]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/holden_red_motor.htm | title = Holden 6 Cylinder RED Motor | publisher = Unique Cars & Parts | accessdate = 2007-05-09}}</ref>

[[Image:1968-1971 Holden Brougham 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Holden Brougham]] (1968–1971) was Holden's first [[Full-size car|full-size]] [[Luxury vehicle|luxury car]]. Broughams were based on the mainstream [[Holden Kingswood|Kingswoods]] of the same years, but featured a greatly lengthened rear body.]]

In February 1965 Holden introduced the HD,<ref name = "heritage1"/> which was quickly updated by the facelifted HR in April 1966 because the car's styling did not resonate favourably with the market. The HR had new front and rear styling, higher capacity engines and Holden sold in excess of 250,000 units over the two-year production run. In 1968, Holden introduced its next major new model, the HK.<ref name = "HK">{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_hk.htm | title = Holden HK | publisher = Unique Cars & Parts | accessdate = 2007-05-12}}</ref> Certain specification levels of the new model included Holden's first [[V8 engine]], a [[Chevrolet]] engine imported from the United States.<ref name = "heritage2">{{cite web | last = Kennedy | first = Alistair | coauthors = Kennedy, Ewan; Davis, Tony | url = http://media.gmcanada.com:8221/aus/holden/en/company/history/HH13Part2.pdf | title = The Holden Heritage - 13th Edition, part two | publisher = GM Holden Ltd | accessdate = 2007-05-09}}</ref> A long-wheelbase prestige model—the [[Holden Brougham|Brougham]] was born off the HK, and the first full-size two-door Holden, the [[Holden Monaro|Monaro]] was also based upon the HK sedan.<ref name = "heritage2"/> The name "Monaro" is an [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] word meaning "higher ground" or "higher plain".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.webwombat.com.au/motoring/news_reports/4_05_hold.htm | title = Monaro arriving this year | publisher = WebWombat Pty Ltd | accessdate = 2007-06-14}}</ref> The main-stream [[Holden Special]], was rebranded the [[Holden Kingswood|Kingswood]], and a basic [[Fleet vehicle|fleet model]] was introduced, known as the [[Holden Belmont|Belmont]].<ref name = "HK"/>

A facelift of the HK, known as the HT was introduced in 1969. The exterior changes included a new radiator grille,<ref name = "HT">{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_ht.htm | title = Holden HT | publisher = Unique Cars & Parts | accessdate = 2007-05-12}}</ref> the first Holden grille to be manufactured from plastic, new rear doors on [[sedan]]s (with larger windows) and new rear styling, with a larger rear window, boot lid and tail lights. A major engineering feat for Holden was the introduction of the first Australian designed and mass produced V8 engine, available in two capacities: 253&nbsp;cubic inch (4.2&nbsp;L) and 308&nbsp;cubic inch (5.0&nbsp;L).<ref name = "HT"/> The 253&nbsp;cubic inch engine was marketed as Australia's first "small V8", and Holden predicted that the V8 would become as popular in the Australian market as in the United States.

The following year, Holden offered the HG: a lightly facelifted car, with a revised radiator grille, tail lights, interior trim and colours.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_hg.htm | title = Holden HG | publisher = Unique Cars & Parts | accessdate = 2007-05-12}}</ref> The HG's major selling point was the introduction of the new Tri-Matic three-speed automatic transmission, which Holden commenced manufacturing at their [[Woodville, South Australia]] factory.

Despite the arrival of serious competitors in the 1960s, namely the Ford Falcon, [[Chrysler Valiant]] and the introduction of [[Japan]]ese cars, Holden's locally-produced large six- and eight-cylinder cars remained Australia's top-selling vehicles. Sales were boosted in exports, with the [[Holden Kingswood|Kingswood]] sedan, station wagon and utility body styles being exported and assembled abroad to places such as [[Indonesia]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and [[South Africa]] where the vehicles were badged as the [[Chevrolet Kommando]].<ref name = "heritage1"/>

[[Image:Holdentorana1971.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Holden Torana|Torana]] was Holden's first [[compact car]], and had its origins in British [[Vauxhall Viva]]s of the mid-1960s.]]

==== Torana: the compact car ====
{{main|Holden Torana}}
The [[Holden Torana|Torana]] was Holden's first offering of the [[compact car]]—a market that was dominated by Japanese models from various marques. The name "Torana" is an [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] word meaning "to fly".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_torana.htm | title = Holden Torana | publisher = Unique Cars & Parts | accessdate = 2007-05-12}}</ref> 

From 1964, Holden had assembled the HA series [[Vauxhall Viva]], marketing the car as "Viva—the GMH small car" (de-emphasising the [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauzhall]] brand). The first Torana, the HB, replaced the Viva in 1967, and Holden offered a new Torana: the LC in 1969, with distinctive new styling. This was the first compact six-cylinder car in the Australian marketplace, and inspired a new category of cars on Australian roads.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_torana_lc.htm | title = Holden Torana LC | publisher = Unique Cars & Parts | accessdate = 2007-05-12}}</ref> LC Torana won the 1969 ''[[Wheels Car of the Year]]'' award, and won numerous awards on the racetrack, and in rallies around Australia.

The next development of the Torana was the LH series, which was introduced in 1974.<ref name = "LH">{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_torana_lh.htm | title = Holden Torana LH | publisher = Unique Cars & Parts | accessdate = 2007-05-12}}</ref> The LH was offered as a four-door sedan only, with a three-door hatchback variant added in the superseding LX series (manufactured between 1976 and 1978). The LH and LX series were offered with a wide range of engine choices, ranging from a 1.9&nbsp;litre four-cylinder, a 2.8&nbsp;litre and 3.3&nbsp;litre six-cylinder or 4.2&nbsp;litre and 5.0&nbsp;litre eight-cylinder.<ref name = "LH"/> At the time, the Torana was the only car in the world to be offered with such a diverse range of engines (although the [[Chevrolet Nova]] offered this choice in the 1960s). The four-cylinder Torana, later became the [[Holden Sunbird]], which lived a six-year lifespan from 1974–1980,<ref name = "LH"/> and the UC series, which followed the LX in 1978, saw the demise of the V8 engine range.

The Torana departed from Holden's line-up in 1979, followed not long after by the Sunbird in 1980. After the 1978 introduction of the [[Holden Commodore]], the Torana became the "in between" car, squeezed out by the smaller and more economical Gemini and the larger, more sophisticated Commodore. The closest successor to the Torana was the [[Holden Camira]], released in 1982. This was Australia's version of GM's medium-sized international "[[GM J platform|J-Car]]".<ref name = "AutoBiography">{{cite book | last = Robinson | first = Peter L. | title = AutoBiography | url = http://www.focus.com.au/ProductDetails.asp?ProdID=64 | publisher = Focus Publishing | year = 2006 | pages = 18–29 | isbn = 1921156104}}</ref> Bodywork for the Camira station wagon was engineered in Australia, and pressings were exported to the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Vauxhall Cavalier]] estate car.<ref name = "heritage1"/>

=== 1970s: from "Australia's Own" to the "World Car" ===
The 1970s opened with the launch of the new HQ series, often considered the most important new model since the original [[Holden 48-215]].<ref name = "heritage2"/> When HQ was introduced, Holden produced all of its range of passenger cars in Australia, and every model in the range was a unique Australian design. However, by the end of the decade, Holden was in transition, producing cars based on overseas designs.

[[Image:Holden VB commodore 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Holden Commodore|Commodore]] quickly followed the success of the [[Holden Kingswood|Kingswood]], and is Holden's bestselling vehicle to date.]]

HQ was thoroughly re-engineered, featuring a perimeter frame and semi-monocoque construction. This provided a level of refinement not seen in this class of vehicle before. Other firsts included wide 60&nbsp;[[inch]] (1500&nbsp;mm) track, all coil suspension, an extended wheelbase for station wagons, utilities and [[panel van]]s, and a new prestige brand: [[Statesman (automobile)|Statesman]], which like the station wagons and utilities, had the benefit of the longer wheelbase.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/holden_HQ_technical_specifications.htm | title = Holden HQ Technical Specifications | publisher = Unique Cars & Parts | accessdate = 2007-06-28}}</ref> The HQ framework spawned a new generation of two-door [[Holden Monaro|Monaros]],<ref name = "heritage2"/> and despite the introduction of the similar sized competitors, the HQ became the number one selling Holden of all time,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_hq.htm | title = Holden HQ | publisher = Unique Cars & Parts | accessdate = 2007-07-11}}</ref> accumulating an astonishing 485,650 sales in just three years.<ref name = "heritage2"/>

In 1975, Holden introduced the [[Holden Gemini|Gemini]], the Australian version of the "[[GM T platform|T-Car]]",<ref name = "heritage2"/> based on the [[Opel Kadett]] C.<ref name = "TX">{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_gemini_tx.htm | title = Holden Gemini TX | publisher = Unique Cars & Parts | accessdate = 2007-05-11}}</ref> Not only was Gemini an overseas design, but it was developed jointly with [[Isuzu]], GM's Japanese affiliate.<ref name = "TX"/> This was recognised with a badge on the rear of the car stating it was a "Holden-Isuzu". The new car was powered by an Isuzu 1.6&nbsp;litre four-cylinder engine,<ref name = "TX"/> and styling was based on the that of the Kadett. Fast becoming a popular car, the Gemini rapidly attained sales leadership in its class, and the nameplate lived on until 1987.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_gemini_rb.htm | title = Holden Gemini RB | publisher = Unique Cars & Parts | accessdate = 2007-05-11}}</ref>

Holden's most popular car to date the [[Holden Commodore|Commodore]], was first seen in 1978 with the introduction of the [[Holden VB Commodore|VB]].<ref name = "AutoBiography"/> Holden's new family car was loosely based on the [[Opel Rekord]] E bodyshell, but with the front grafted on from the [[Opel Senator]] to accommodate the larger Holden six-cylinder and [[V8 engine]]s. Initially, Commodore maintained Holden's sales leadership in Australia.<ref name = "AutoBiography"/> However, some of the compromises resulting from the adoption of a design intended for another market hampered Commodore's acceptance. In particular, Commodore was narrower than its predecessor and the Falcon rival, which meant that it was less accommodating for three rear seat passengers. The Commodore was perceived as being smaller than Falcon, which costed Holden sales. The width problem was not resolved until the introduction of the wider [[Holden VN Commodore|VN]] in 1988, which became the first [[Full-size car|full-size]] Commodore.<ref name = "AutoBiography"/>

[[Image:Holden LG Nova 01.jpg|thumb|left|The Holden-[[Toyota]] alliance, saw Holden adopt badge engineered Toyotas and vice versa. The [[Toyota Corolla]] and [[Toyota Camry|Camry]] models were sold as the [[Holden Nova]] ''(pictured)'', and [[Holden Apollo|Apollo]] respectively.]]

=== 1980s: toughest decade ===
The 1980s were a challenging time for Holden, with the Australian car industry experiencing difficulties. The [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] intervened to endeavour to revive the industry, with the establishment of the [[Button car plan]], named after [[John Button]], the Federal Industry Minister. The Button car plan aimed to improve viability by encouraging the industry to focus on producing larger (and more economic) volumes of fewer models, as well as providing incentives for exports.<ref>{{cite web | last = Christie | first = Don | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3165/is_n9_v26/ai_8945968 | title = Automakers want to unbutton Australia - Sen. John Button's plan for consolidation of Australia's auto industry | publisher = Ward's Auto World | accessdate = 2007-06-28}}</ref>

Holden experienced financial challenges as profitability fell in the face of declining sales of the [[Holden Commodore|Commodore]] and [[Holden Gemini|Gemini]] models. The competition from [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] intensified, with the popular new [[Ford Laser|Laser]], a compact car based on the [[Mazda 323]], and their updated [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Falcon]]. Also, other Australian manufacturers; [[Toyota]], [[Nissan]] and [[Mitsubishi Motors]] were gaining market share.<ref>{{cite web | last = Kenwright | first = Joe | url = http://editorial.carsales.com.au/car-review/1916079.aspx | title = Crossing the Lion (July 2006) | publisher = carsales.com.au Limited | accessdate = 2007-06-28}}</ref>

Holden released the [[Holden Camira|Camira]] in 1982, which was Holden's version of the "[[GM J platform|J-Car]]". After a good sales start, Camira sales faltered, as buyers considered the 1.6&nbsp;litre engine to have inadequate power, and the car's reputation was tarnished by below average build and ride quality problems.<ref name = "AutoBiography"/>

In 1985, Holden's parent, General Motors reorganised and recapitalised the business. At this time, the engine manufacturing and car manufacturing divisions were separated. The engine manufacturing business was successful, building four-cylinder [[GM Family II engine]]s for use in cars built overseas.<ref name = "AutoBiography"/> Holden became the source of engines for the [[Vauxhall Cavalier]] and the [[Opel Ascona]] built in Europe. In the same year, the [[Holden Barina|Barina]] [[Supermini car|supermini]] was launched, becoming Holden's first truly small car.<ref name = "heritage2"/> The rebadged [[Suzuki Swift]], allowed Holden to broaden their market appeal.<ref>{{cite web | last = Kennedy | first = Ewan | url = http://www.marque.com.au/usedcars/060306_Suzuki_Swift.htm | title = Suzuki Swift 1985-1999 | publisher = Marque Publishing Company | accessdate = 2007-06-28}}</ref>

Holden began to sell rebadged [[Nissan Pulsar]] hatchbacks as the [[Holden Astra]] in 1985, as a result of a deal struck with [[Nissan]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Kennedy | first = Ewan | date = [[2006-09-18]] | url = http://www.marque.com.au/usedcars/060918_Holden_Astra.htm | title = Nissan Pulsar 1996-2006 | publisher = Marque Publishing Company | accessdate = 2007-05-11}}</ref> When Nissan released a new model Pulsar (with an Astra clone) in 1987,<ref name = "heritage2"/> it was powered by the GM Family II engine which powered the Camira.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_camira_jb.htm | title = Holden Camira JB | publisher = Unique Cars & Parts | accessdate = 2007-05-11}}</ref> This arrangement ceased in 1988,<ref name = "IOSC">{{cite book | last = Earl | first = Peter E. | title = Information, Opportunism and Economic Coordination | publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing | year = 2002 | pages = 24–28 | isbn = 1840647388}}</ref> when Holden entered a new alliance with [[Toyota]].

In 1984, Holden introduced the [[Holden VK Commodore|VK Commodore]], with significantly styling changes from the previous [[Holden VH Commodore|VH]]. The next update for the Commodore appeared in 1986 with the [[Holden VL Commodore|VL]], which had new front and rear styling.<ref name = "heritage2"/> Controversially, the VL was powered by the [[Nissan RB engine|Nissan RB30]] 3.0&nbsp;litre six-cylinder engine, and electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission. The change to the Nissan engine was necessitated by the legal requirement that all new cars sold in Australia from 1986 had to run on unleaded petrol.<ref>{{cite web | date = [[2007-06-21]] | url = http://www.epa.qld.gov.au/environmental_management/air/caring_for_our_air/ | title = Caring for our air | publisher = [[Government of Queensland|The State of Queensland]] | accessdate = 2007-07-11}}</ref> It was not feasible to convert the six-cylinder engine to run on unleaded fuel, and the Nissan engine was chosen as representing the best engine available. However, due to the changing exchange rates over the life of the VL, the cost of the Nissan engines doubled.<ref name = "AutoBiography"/> The final phase of the Commodore's recovery strategy sat in the hands of the 1988 [[Holden VN Commodore|VN]], which was significantly wider than before. The VN was powered by the American-designed 3.8&nbsp;litre [[Buick V6 engine]].

=== 1990s: comeback years ===
This decade saw Holden's transformation continue. By the end of the decade, Holden was a confident and successful participant in the Australian car industry, as well as having a place on the world automotive stage. Besides manufacturing Australia's bestselling car, which was exported in significant numbers, many of the Holden's locally produced engines continued to be sent abroad to power cars made outside of Australia. In this decade, Holden adopted a new trend, where they imported a range of cars to allowing them to offer a full range of competitive vehicles.<ref>{{cite web | url =

In 1990 Holden revitalised the wide-body Commodore, which was significantly more successful than its predecessor. The defunct [[Statesman (automobile)|Statesman]] brand was reintroduced, however the models were sold as the [[Holden Statesman]] and [[Holden Caprice|Caprice]] correspondingly. As well as the prestige variants, the [[Holden Ute|Ute]] made a welcome return.<ref name = "AutoBiography"/> Local production of the [[Buick]] sourced [[Buick V6 engine|3.8&nbsp;litre V6 engine]] commenced to provide power for the Commodore range, and the 5.0&nbsp;litre V8 engine was later replaced in 1999.<ref name = "heritage3">{{cite web | url = http://media.gmcanada.com:8221/aus/holden/en/company/history/HH13Part3.pdf | title = The Holden Heritage - 13th Edition, part three | publisher = GM Holden Ltd | accessdate = 2007-05-09}}</ref> Strong Commodore sales were contributed by the fact that [[Ford]] had numerous problems with their new [[Ford EA Falcon|EA Falcon]] which they introduced in 1988.<ref>{{cite web | date = [[1999-02-26]] | url = http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=8330&vf=24 | title = Used car test - Ford Fairlane | publisher = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | accessdate = 2007-05-14}}</ref>

The UAAI "badge engineered" cars fared poorly, although the Holden Commodore, [[Toyota Camry]] and [[Toyota Corolla|Corolla]] were all successful when sold under their original nameplates. Potential customers could see the "copies" were thinly disguised versions of popular cars, and instead purchased the vehicles from the original manufacturer.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/60DB5F93CC0B207FCA256D21001310D6 | title = Car review - Holden Nova 5-dr hatch | publisher = GoAuto | accessdate = 2007-05-13}}</ref> In 1996, UAAI was dissolved, and Holden recommenced sourcing product offerings from within GM rather than from competitors.<ref name = "AutoBiography"/> The Toyota sourced [[Holden Nova|Nova]] and [[Holden Apollo|Apollo]] were replaced with the [[Holden Astra]] and [[Holden Vectra|Vectra]], which imported from [[Opel]] in [[Europe]]. Assembly of Vectra commenced at [[Elizabeth, South Australia]] and these cars were exported to [[Japan]] and [[South America]]. However, the Vectra did not achieve sufficient sales in Australia to justify local assembly, and reverted to being fully imported in 1999.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/8FECAC2A36315B23CA256D65001A367C | title = Car review - Holden Vectra CDXi 5-dr hatch | publisher = GoAuto | accessdate = 2007-05-13}}</ref> In 1994, the [[Opel Corsa]] replaced the already available [[Suzuki Swift]] as the source for the [[Holden Barina]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/D928D7E37EE64519CA256D210003F9D7 | title = Car review - Holden Barina Swing 5-dr hatch | publisher = GoAuto | accessdate = 2007-05-13}}</ref>

In August 1997 the all-new [[Holden VT Commodore|VT Commodore]] was introduced, and was the outcome of an [[Australian dollar|AU$]]600 million development programme which spanned over half a decade. The new model sported a rounded exterior body shell, improved dynamics and many 'firsts' for an Australian-built car. A stronger body structure contributed to gains in crash safety, and in late 1997, just months after its introduction was crowned ''[[Wheels Car of the Year]]''.<ref name = "WheelsVEMag">{{Citation | last = Newton | first = Bruce | last2 = Robinson | first2 = Peter | last3 = McCarthy | first3 = Mike | last4 = McKay | first4 = Peter | title = 2006 Collector's Edition VE Commodore: The Full Story | publisher = [[Australian Consolidated Press]] | journal = [[Wheels magazine]] | pages = 158 | date = October 2006}}</ref> A revived Monaro, based on the [[Holden VT Commodore]], attracted wide attention since being shown as a [[concept car]] at Australian [[motor show]]s, and drew a large waiting list after it was put into production. The revived Monaro was released to the Australian market in October 2001, and ceased production in 2005.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_monaro.htm | title = Holden Monaro | publisher = Unique Cars & Parts | accessdate = 2007-06-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | date = [[2005-07-21]] | url = http://www.webwombat.com.au/motoring/news_reports/holden-monaro-cv8-z.htm | title = Holden Waves Goodbye to Monaro | publisher = WebWombat Pty Ltd | accessdate = 2007-06-28}}</ref>

[[Image:2007 Holden VE Commodore Omega 01.jpg|thumb|The 2006 [[Holden VE Commodore]] was the first vehicle Holden had completely designed and engineered in Australia, since 1971.]]

=== 2000s: Daewoo and the all-new Commodore ===
Holden's trend of importing many of their models from [[Opel]] in [[Germany]] continued throughout the first half of the 2000s. But to increase profitability, Holden has now looked to the GM-owned [[GM Daewoo|Daewoo]] in [[South Korea]] for replacements.<ref>{{cite web | last = McKinnon | first = Bill | date = [[2005-11-25]] | url = http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=10699 | title = Holden Barina | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | accessdate = 2007-05-14}}</ref> Holden had already established close research and design links with Daewoo, with which it provides the large [[Holden Statesman|Statesman]] model. In 2005, the [[Opel]]-sourced [[Holden Barina]] was replaced by the [[Daewoo Kalos]], which continued to be marketed under the Barina nameplate.<ref>{{cite web | date = [[2006-01-14]] | url = http://carsguide.news.com.au/story/0,20384,17835536-27286,00.html | title = New Barina's price calms sentiment | publisher = [[The Courier-Mail]] | accessdate = 2007-03-05}}</ref> The entry-level [[Holden Astra]] Classic was replaced by the Holden Viva, which is based on the [[Daewoo Lacetti]].<ref name = "JF">{{cite web | date = [[2006-10-26]] | url = http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=10699 | title = Holden Viva Hatch | publisher = [[The Australian]] | accessdate = 2007-05-14}}</ref> However the European-sourced Astra nameplate continued, but was marketed as a more upmarket model.<ref name = "JF"/> In 2006 Holden begun selling the [[Holden Captiva]], a [[Crossover SUV]] which is manufactured by Daewoo with Australian-built versions of the [[Alloytec#Holden 3.2|Alloytec V6 engine]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Stevens | first = Samantha | date = [[2006-10-10]] | url = http://carsguide.news.com.au/story/0,20384,20562133-5003140,00.html | title = Holden Captiva: imported SUV | publisher = [[The Sunday Telegraph]] | accessdate = 2007-05-14}}</ref> The third Holden model to be replaced with a South Korean alternative was the [[Opel Vectra|Vectra]], being surpassed by the [[Mid-size car|mid-size]] [[Daewoo Tosca|Epica]] in April 2007.<ref>{{cite web | last = Porter | first = Ian | date = [[2007-01-31]] | url = http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=23056&vf=1 | title = Tosca sweetens Holden range | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | accessdate = 2007-05-14}}</ref>

The 1997 [[Holden VT Commodore|VT Commodore]] received its first major update in 2002 with the [[Holden VY Commodore|VY]],<ref name = "heritage3"/> and in 2006, Holden launched the all-new [[Holden VE Commodore|VE]].<ref>{{cite web | date = [[2006-07-15]] | url = http://www.caradvice.com.au/528/holden-ve-commodore-launch/ | title = Holden VE Commodore Launch | publisher = CarAdvice.com.au Pty Ltd | accessdate = 2007-05-06}}</ref> VE came to be the first Commodore model with all-Australian origins, as opposed to previous generations' Opel sourced [[Automobile platform|platforms]], which had been adapted both mechanically and in size for the local market.<ref name = "AutoBiography"/>

[[Chairman]] and managing director [[Denny Mooney]], currently heads operations at Holden, which has been a subsidiary of [[General Motors]] since 1931. Leaders in charge of secondary departments include: William Lesner, Alison Terry, Ian McCleave, Tony Hyde, Tony Stolfo, Alan Batey, Rodney Keane, Scott Sandefur, Pierre Matthee, Gene Stefanyshyn, Raymundo Garza, Mark Bernhard, and Fiona Harden.<ref name = "profile"/> Vehicles are sold countrywide, through the Holden Dealer Network (310 authorised stores and 12 service centres) which employs over 13,500 people.<ref name = "profile"/>

Since the 1960s, Holdens have been a staple of domestic [[touring car racing]], and the quasi-factory [[Holden Racing Team]] (HRT) has successfully participated in [[V8 Supercar]] racing.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.hsv.com.au/racing/2004/history/history.htm | title = Holden Racing Team History | publisher = Holden Special Vehicles | accessdate = 2007-06-28}}</ref> In 1987, [[Holden Special Vehicles]] (HSV) formed in partnership with Tom Walkinshaw, and primarily manufactures modified, high-performance Commodore variants.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.hsv.com.au/studentpack/spackhistory.htm | title = HSV History & Background | publisher = Holden Special Vehicles | accessdate = 2007-06-28}}</ref> To further reinforce the brand, HSV introduced the [[Toll HSV Dealer Team]] into the V8 Supercar fold in 2005, under the naming rights of HSV Toll Racing.<ref>{{cite web | date = [[2005-11-21]] | url = http://www.hsvdt.com.au/hsvdt_new/2006/news/toll_hsvdt_release.asp | title = Toll and HSV Dealer Team confirm V8 Supercar alliance | publisher = Toll HSV Dealer Team | accessdate = 2007-06-28}}</ref>

The logo or "Holden lion" as it is known, has played a vital role in establishing Holden's identity with roots tracing back to 1928, when George Raynor Hof was appointed by Holden’s Motor Body Builders to design the emblem. The fable behind the logo dates back to [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] times when observations were made of [[lion]]s rolling stones, leading to the invention of the wheel. With the 1948 launch of the [[Holden 48-215|48-215]], Holden revised their logo,<ref>{{Citation | last = Wright | first = John | title = Badgeology | year = 2004 | magazine = [[Wheels magazine]] May 2004 | pages = 152}}</ref> and commissioned yet another redesign in 1972, to better represent the company at the time. The emblem was reworked once more in 1994.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.holden.com.au/www-holden/jsp/corporateinfo/history/history.jsp?link=symbol | title = The Story of the Holden Lion | publisher = GM Holden Ltd | accessdate = 2007-07-12}}</ref>

=== Export markets ===
The Holden Commodore is as popular in [[New Zealand]] (where it has hit the number-one slot in the sales charts from time to time) as it is in Australia, often being used as police cars. Commodores have also been sold in [[South Africa]], [[Thailand]], and are currently marketed in parts of the [[Middle East]] badged as [[Chevrolet Lumina (Australia)|Chevrolet Luminas]]. In [[Brazil]] badge engineered Commodores are sold as the [[Chevrolet Omega]], and both V6 and V8 versions of the Commodore will be exported to the United States as the [[Pontiac G8]] from 2008.<ref>{{cite web | last = Butler | first = Glenn | date = [[2007-05-06]] | url = http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=29015 | title = Holden confirms Pontiac deal | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | accessdate = 2007-05-06}}</ref> Holden's exports to the Middle East and Brazil were the first [[Driving on the left or right|left-hand drive]] cars built since the 1960s, when Holden sold cars in [[Hawaii]].<ref name = "heritage1"/>

A modified version of the [[Holden Monaro]] (in turn a modified Commodore) has been sold in the [[United States]] as the [[Pontiac GTO]] and its model name through [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]] dealerships in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref name = "heritage1"/> Vauxhall have commenced sales of the HSV Clubsport R8, badged as the [[Vauxhall VXR8]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Thorp | first = Chris | date = [[2007-03-06]] | url = http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/news/autoexpressnews/205692/vauxhall_vxr8.html | title = Vauxhall unleashes all-new supersaloon | publisher = Dennis Publishing Limited | accessdate = 2007-07-23}}</ref> Since the late 1990s Holden has exported their luxury [[Holden Statesman|Statesman]] sedan to the Middle East as the [[Chevrolet Caprice (Australia)|Chevrolet Caprice]], and to South Korea as the [[Daewoo Statesman]].
