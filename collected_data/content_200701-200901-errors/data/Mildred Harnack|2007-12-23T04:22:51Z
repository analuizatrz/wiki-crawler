'''Mildred Harnack''' (born '''Mildred Fish''', [[16 September]] [[1902]] in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]]; died [[16 February]] [[1943]] in [[Berlin]]-[[Plötzensee]]) was an [[United States|American]]-[[Germany|German]] [[History of literature|literary historian]], [[translator]], and [[Widerstand|resistance]] fighter in [[Nazi Germany]].

== Life in the United States==
Harnack was the youngest child of William Fish and Goergina Hesketh Fish. Her siblings were Harriette, Marion, and Marbeau (Bob). In 1919 she graduated from [[Western High School]] in [[Georgetown, Virginia]]. In 1926, she was studying and working as a lecturer on [[German literature]] at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]], and there she met the German [[jurist]] [[Arvid Harnack]]. They were later married in a ceremony at her brother's farm near [[Brooklyn, Wisconsin]]. She finished her senior thesis in 1928: "A Comparison of Chapman’s and Pope’s translations of the ''Iliad'' with the Original". During her time at Madison, she also worked on the ''Wisconsin Literary Magazine''. In 1928-1929, she taught English at [[Goucher College]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]].

== Life in Germany ==
In 1929, she and her husband moved to Germany, where she worked on her doctorate at the [[University of Giessen]].

In 1930 she moved from [[Gießen]] to [[Berlin]] to be with her husband, and to study at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] on a fellowship from the [[Alexander von Humboldt Foundation]]. She also worked as an assistant lecturer ([[English literature|English]] and [[American literature]] and [[English language|language]]) and a translator. She was also involved with the American Student Association, the American Women’s Club, where she served as president, the Berlin chapter of the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]], where she served as secretary, and the American Church.

== Political activities ==
[[Image:ArvidandMildredHarnack.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Arvid and Mildred Harnack in the early 1930s]]It was during her time in Berlin that she became interested in the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Communism]], seeing them as a solution to [[poverty]]. In 1932, however, she was let go from her teaching position, as were many other women and foreigners. She toured the Soviet Union later that year with her husband and leading academics.

In 1933, Harnack began teaching English literature at the Berliner Abendgymnasium (evening secondary school). She sometimes discussed economic and political ideas from the [[United States]] and the Soviet Union with her students. She also joined the National Socialist teachers’ organization.

She also busied herself editing a book column in an English-language newspaper ''Berlin Topics'' along with the US [[Ambassador]]'s daughter Martha Dodd. She also wrote in [[German language|German]] for ''Berliner Tageblatt'' and ''Die Literatur'' until 1935, when the Nazis' strictures made this too difficult.

In 1936, she published her German translation of [[Irving Stone]]’s biography of [[Vincent van Gogh]], ''[[Lust for Life (novel)|Lust for Life]]''. She also continued to work as a translator for various publishing companies.

In 1937, Mildred Harnack visited the United States and went on a campus lecture tour whose theme was "The German Relation to Current American Literature".

== The Red Orchestra ==
Together with her husband Arvid, the writer [[Adam Kuckhoff]] and his wife [[Greta Kuckhoff|Greta]], Harnack brought together a discussion circle which debated political perspectives on the time after the [[National_Socialist_German_Workers_Party|National Socialists]]' expected downfall or overthrow. From these meetings arose what the [[Gestapo]] would call the [[Red Orchestra]] (''Rote Kapelle'') resistance group.

In 1940-1941, the group was in [[wireless]] contact with Soviet agents, trying to thwart the forthcoming German attack upon the [[Soviet Union]]. Harnack even sent the Soviets information about the forthcoming [[Operation Barbarossa]].

Meanwhile, Harnack was making contact with people who were against the Nazi régime, recruiting some for the resistance, and serving as go-between for her husband, other members of the Orchestra, and Soviet agents.

== Arrest, trial, and death ==
[[Image:CIC_RO_M_Harnack.jpg|thumb|rigt|180px|CIC file ref. Mildred Harnack (about 1947)]]In July 1942, the [[Decryption]] Department of the ''[[Oberkommando des Heeres]]'' managed to decode the group's radio messages, and the [[Gestapo]] pounced. On 7 September, Arvid and Mildred Harnack were arrested while on a weekend outing. At this time, Mildred had been teaching English at the Foreign Studies Department of the University of Berlin. Arvid Harnack was sentenced to death on 19 December after a four-day trial before the ''Reichskriegsgericht'' ("Reich [[Military tribunal|Military Tribunal]]"), and was put to death three days later at Plötzensee Prison in Berlin. Mildred Harnack was given six years in prison, although [[Hitler]] shortly afterwards cancelled that sentence and ordered a new trial, which ended with a death sentence on 16 January 1943. She was [[Beheading|beheaded]] on 16 February 1943. Her last words were purported to have been: ''"Und ich hatte Deutschland so geliebt"'' ("And I had loved Germany so much").

When her friend and colleague Clara Leiser learned of the execution, she wrote the poem ''To and from the guillotine'' in remembrance of her friend, Harnack.
