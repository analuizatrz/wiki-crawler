'''Canada''' ({{IPAEng|ˈkænədə}}) is a [[country]] occupying most of northern [[North America]], extending from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the east to the [[Pacific Ocean]] in the west and northward into the [[Arctic Ocean]].  It is the [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|world's second largest country]] by total area,<ref name="cia_factbook">{{cite web |author=Central Intelligence Agency |publisher= Central Intelligence Agency |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ca.html |title=The World Factbook: Canada |date=[[2006-05-16]] |accessdate=2007-05-06}}</ref> and shares [[Canada–United States border|land borders]] with the [[United States]] to the south and northwest.

The lands have been inhabited for millennia by [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal peoples]]. Beginning in the late 15th century, [[British colonization of the Americas|British]] and [[French colonization of the Americas|French]] expeditions explored and later settled the Atlantic coast. France ceded nearly all of [[New France|its colonies in North America]] in 1763 after the [[Seven Years War]].  In 1867, with the union of three [[British North America]]n colonies through [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], Canada became a federal [[dominion]].<ref>{{cite web| title = Territorial evolution| work = Atlas of Canada | publisher = Natural Resources Canada |  url =http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/reference/anniversary_maps/terr_evol | format = html/pdf | accessdate =  2007-10-09| quote = In 1867, the colonies of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick are united in a federal state, the Dominion of Canada.... }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title = Canada: History| work = Country Profiles | publisher = Commonwealth Secretariat |  url =http://www.thecommonwealth.org/YearbookInternal/145152/history/ | format = html/pdf | accessdate =  2007-10-09| quote = The British North America Act of 1867 brought together four British colonies ... in one federal Dominion under the name of Canada.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last = Hillmer| first = Norman | authorlink =| coauthors = W.

A [[federation]] now comprising [[Provinces and territories of Canada|ten provinces and three territories]], Canada is a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] and a [[constitutional monarchy]] with [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] as its head of state. It is a [[Bilingualism in Canada|bilingual]] and [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] country, with both [[Canadian English|English]] and [[French language in Canada|French]] as official languages at the federal level. [[Developed country|Technologically advanced and industrialized]], Canada maintains a diversified economy that is heavily reliant upon its abundant natural resources and upon trade—particularly with the United States, with which Canada has had a [[Canada–United States relations|long and complex relationship]].

== Etymology ==
{{main|Canada's name}}<!--Please see the talk page before editing or reverting this to specify which (of several) languages produced the word Canada. There are differences of opinion, which may be best discussed at the main article Canada's name-->
[[Image:Cartier.png|thumb|upright|left|[[Jacques Cartier]]]]

The name ''Canada'' comes from a [[St. Lawrence Iroquoians|St. Lawrence Iroquoian]] word meaning "village" or "settlement."  In 1535, inhabitants of the present-day [[Quebec City]] region used the word to direct explorer [[Jacques Cartier]] toward the village of [[Stadacona]].<ref>{{cite book | first = Bruce G. |last = Trigger | coauthors =  Pendergast, James F. | year = 1978 |chapter=Saint-Lawrence Iroquoians | title = Handbook of North American Indians Volume 15 | location= Washington |publisher= Smithsonian Institution | pages= pp. 357–361 | id = OCLC 58762737}}</ref> Cartier used the word 'Canada' to refer to not only that village, but the entire area subject to [[Donnacona]], Chief at Stadacona. By 1545, European books and maps began referring to this region as Canada.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/12356/12356-h/12356-h.htm | title = Relation originale de Jacques Cartier | publisher = Tross (1863 edition) | author = Jacques Cartier | date = 1545 | accessdate = 2007-02-23}}</ref> 

The French colony of [[Canada, New France|Canada]] referred to the part of [[New France]] along the [[Saint Lawrence River]] and the northern shores of the [[Great Lakes]]. Later, it was split into two British colonies, called [[Upper Canada]] and [[Lower Canada]] until their union as the British [[Province of Canada]] in 1841. Upon [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] in 1867, the name ''Canada'' was adopted for the entire country, and was frequently referred to as the ''[[Dominion]] of Canada'' until the 1950s. As Canada asserted its political autonomy from [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the federal government increasingly simply used ''Canada'' on legal state documents and treaties. The [[Canada Act 1982]] refers only to "Canada" and, as such, it is currently the only legal (and bilingual) name. This was reflected in 1982 with the renaming of the national holiday from [[Dominion Day]] to [[Canada Day]].

Aboriginal and Inuit tradition holds that the [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|First Peoples]] inhabited parts of Canada since the dawn of time. Archaeological studies support a human presence in northern [[Yukon]] from 26,500 years ago, and in southern [[Ontario]] from 9,500 years ago.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Cinq-Mars | first = J. | year = 2001 | title = On the significance of modified mammoth bones from eastern Beringia | journal = The World of Elephants - International Congress, Rome | url = http://www.cq.rm.cnr.it/elephants2001/pdf/424_428.pdf | accessdate = 2006-05-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Wright, J.V |publisher= Canadian Museum of Civilization Corporation |url=http://www.civilization.ca/archeo/hnpc/npvol04e.html |title=A History of the Native People of Canada: Early and Middle Archaic Complexes|date=[[2001-09-27]]|accessdate=2006-05-14}}</ref> [[European colonization of the Americas|Europeans first arrived]] when the [[Vikings]] settled briefly at [[L'Anse aux Meadows]] circa AD 1000.

French explorer [[Samuel de Champlain]] arrived in 1603 and established the first permanent European settlements at [[Port Royal, Nova Scotia|Port Royal]] in 1605 and [[Quebec City]] in 1608. These would become respectively the capitals of Acadia and Canada.  Among [[French colonization of the Americas|French colonists]] of [[New France]], ''[[Canadiens]]'' extensively settled the [[St. Lawrence River]] valley, [[Acadians]] settled the present-day [[Maritimes]], while [[Coureurs de bois|French fur traders]] and [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle|Catholic missionaries]] explored the [[Great Lakes]], [[Hudson Bay]] and the [[Mississippi River#Watershed|Mississippi watershed]] to [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]]. The [[French and Iroquois Wars]] broke out over control of the [[fur trade]].

The [[Kingdom of England|English]] established fishing outposts in [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] around 1610 and [[British colonization of the Americas|colonized]] the [[Thirteen Colonies]] to the south. A series of four [[French and Indian Wars|Intercolonial Wars]] erupted between 1689 and 1763. Mainland [[Nova Scotia]] came under British rule with the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] (1713); the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]] ceded Canada and most of [[New France]] to [[British Empire|Britain]] following the [[French and Indian War|Seven Years' War]]. <!--(The western portion, [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]], was ceded to Spain, briefly.)-->

[[Image:Benjamin West 005.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'' on the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham|Plains of Abraham]] at [[Quebec City|Quebec]] in 1759, part of the [[French and Indian War|Seven Years' War]].]]The [[Royal Proclamation of 1763|Royal Proclamation (1763)]] carved the [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Province of Quebec]] out of [[New France]] and annexed [[Cape Breton Island]] to [[Nova Scotia]]. It also restricted the language and religious rights of [[French Canadians]]. In 1769, St. John's Island (now [[Prince Edward Island]]) became a separate colony. To avert conflict in Quebec, the [[Quebec Act]] of 1774 expanded Quebec's territory to the [[Great Lakes]] and [[Ohio Valley]], and re-established the French language, Catholic faith, and French civil law in Quebec; it angered many residents of the Thirteen Colonies, helping to fuel the [[American Revolution]].<ref>{{cite web | author= |publisher= |title= Wars on Our Soil, earliest times to 1885 |accessdate=2006-08-21 |url=http://www.civilization.ca/cwm/gallery1/revolution2_e.html}}</ref> The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]] recognized American independence and ceded territories south of the [[Great Lakes]] to the [[United States]].

To accommodate English-speaking Loyalists in [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Quebec]], the [[Constitutional Act of 1791]] divided the province into French-speaking [[Lower Canada]] and English-speaking [[Upper Canada]], granting each their own elected Legislative Assembly. 

Canada was a major front in the [[War of 1812]] between the United States and British Empire. Its defence contributed to a sense of unity among British North Americans. Large-scale immigration to Canada began in 1815 from Britain and Ireland. The [[timber industry]] would also surpass the [[fur trade]] in importance in the early 1800s. 

The desire for [[Responsible Government]] resulted in the aborted [[Rebellions of 1837]]. [[Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839)|The Durham Report (1839)]] would subsequently recommend responsible government and the assimilation of French Canadians into British culture.<ref name="ce_durhamreport">{{cite web |author=David Mills |publisher= Historica Foundation of Canada |url=http://www.canadianencyclopedia.ca/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0002473 |title=Durham Report |accessdate=2006-05-18}}</ref> The [[Act of Union (1840)]] merged [[The Canadas]]  into a [[United Province of Canada]]. French and English Canadians worked together in the Assembly to reinstate French rights. [[Responsible government#British North America|Responsible government]] was established for all British North American provinces by 1849. 

The signing of the [[Oregon Treaty]] by Britain and the United States in 1846 ended the [[Oregon boundary dispute]], extending the border westward along the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]], and paving the way for British colonies on [[Colony of Vancouver Island|Vancouver Island (1849)]] and in [[Colony of British Columbia|British Columbia (1858)]]. Canada launched a series of western exploratory expeditions to claim [[Rupert's Land]] and the [[Arctic]] region. The Canadian population grew rapidly because of high birth rates; British immigration was offset by emigration to the United States, especially by French Canadians moving to [[New England]].

[[Image:Canada provinces evolution.gif|thumb|left|An animated map, exhibiting [[Territorial evolution of Canada|the growth and refactoring of Canada's provinces and territories since Confederation.]]]]Following several constitutional conferences, the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act]] brought about [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] creating "one Dominion under the name of [[Canada's name#Adoption of Dominion|Canada]]" on July 1, 1867 with four provinces: [[Ontario]], [[Quebec]], [[Nova Scotia]], and [[New Brunswick]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Farthing |first= John |title= Freedom Wears a Crown |location= Toronto |publisher=Kingswood House |date=1957 |id = ASIN B0007JC4G2}}</ref>  Canada assumed control of [[Rupert's Land]] and the [[North-Western Territory]] to form the [[Northwest Territories]], where [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis']] grievances ignited the [[Red River Rebellion]] and the creation of the province of [[Manitoba]] in July 1870. British Columbia and Vancouver Island (which had [[United Colonies of Vancouver Island and British Columbia|united]] in 1866) and the colony of [[Prince Edward Island]] joined Confederation in 1871 and 1873, respectively. 

[[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[John A. Macdonald]]'s [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative Party]] established a [[National Policy]] of [[tariffs]] to protect nascent Canadian manufacturing industries. To open the West, the government sponsored construction of three trans-continental railways  (most notably the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]), opened the prairies to settlement with the [[Dominion Lands Act]], and established the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|North West Mounted Police]] to assert its authority over this territory.   In 1898, after the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] in the Northwest Territories, the Canadian government decided to create the [[Yukon]] territory as a separate territory in the region to better control the situation. Under [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Wilfrid Laurier]], continental European immigrants settled the prairies, and [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]] became provinces in 1905.

[[Image:Canadian tank and soldiers Vimy 1917.jpg|thumb|right|Canadian soldiers would win the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]] in 1917.]]
Canada automatically entered the [[First World War]] in 1914 with Britain's declaration of war, sending volunteers to the Western Front. The [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]]  erupted when [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|conservative]] Prime Minister [[Robert Borden]] brought in compulsory military service over the objection of French-speaking Quebecers.  In 1919, Canada joined the [[League of Nations]] independently of Britain; in 1931 the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] affirmed Canada's independence. 

The [[Great Depression of 1929]] brought economic hardship to all of Canada. In response, the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (CCF) in Alberta and Saskatchewan presaged a welfare state as pioneered by [[Tommy Douglas]] in the 1940s and 1950s. Canada [[Military history of Canada during World War II|declared war on Germany]] independently during [[World War II]] under Liberal Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]], three days after Britain.

In 1949, [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] joined Confederation as Canada's 10th province. Post-war prosperity and economic expansion ignited a [[Post-World War II baby boom|baby boom]] and attracted immigration from war-ravaged European countries.<ref>{{cite web | author= Harold Troper |publisher= Ontario Institute for Studies in Education |url=http://ceris.metropolis.net/Virtual%20Library/Demographics/troper1/troper1.html |title=History of Immigration to Toronto Since the Second World War: From Toronto 'the Good' to Toronto 'the World in a City' |date=2000-03 |accessdate=2006-05-19}}</ref> 

[[Quebec]] underwent profound social and economic changes during the [[Quiet Revolution]] of the 1960s. [[Québécois]] [[Quebec nationalism|nationalists]] began pressing for greater provincial autonomy. The [[Quebec sovereignty movement|separatist]] [[Parti Québécois]] first came to power in 1976. A [[referendum]] on [[sovereignty-association]] in [[1980 Quebec referendum|1980]] was rejected by a solid majority of the population, and a second referendum in [[1995 Quebec referendum|1995]] was rejected by a slimmer margin of just 50.6% to 49.4%.<ref name="dickinson">{{cite book |first= John Alexander |last=Dickinson |coauthors=Young, Brian |year=2003 |title=A Short History of Quebec |publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |edition=3rd edition |location= Montreal |id=ISBN 0-7735-2450-9}}</ref> In 1997, the Canadian Supreme Court ruled [[Reference re Secession of Quebec|unilateral secession by a province to be unconstitutional]]; Quebec's sovereignty movement has continued nonetheless.<ref name="dickinson" />

Under successive [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] governments of [[Lester B. Pearson]] and [[Pierre Trudeau]], a new [[Canadian identity]] emerged. Canada adopted its current [[Flag of Canada|Maple Leaf Flag]] in 1965. In response to a more assertive [[francophone|French-speaking]] [[Quebec]], the federal government became [[Bilingualism in Canada|officially bilingual]] with the [[Official Languages Act (Canada)|Official Languages Act]] of 1969.  Non-discriminatory [[Immigration to Canada|Immigration Acts]] were introduced in 1967 and 1976, and official [[Multiculturalism#Origins in Canada|multiculturalism]] in 1971; waves of non-European immigration have changed the face of the country. [[Social democratic]] programs such as [[Medicare (Canada)|Universal Health Care]], the [[Canada Pension Plan]], and [[Canada Student Loans]] were initiated in the 1960s and consolidated in the 1970s; provincial governments, particularly Quebec, fought these as incursions into their jurisdictions. Finally, Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] pushed through the [[patriation]] of the constitution from Britain, enshrining a [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] based on [[individual rights]] in the [[Constitution Act of 1982]].

Economic integration with the United States has increased significantly since World War II. The [[Canada-United States Automotive Agreement]] (or Auto Pact) in 1965 and the [[Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement]] of 1987 were defining moments in integrating the two economies. [[Canadian nationalism|Canadian nationalists]] continued to worry about their cultural autonomy as American television shows, movies and corporations became omnipresent.<ref name="granatstein">{{cite book |first= J.L. |last=Granatstein |year=1997 |title=Yankee Go Home: Canadians and Anti-Americanism |publisher=HarperCollins |location= Toronto |id=ISBN 0-00-638541-9}}</ref> However, Canadians take special pride in their [[Health care in Canada|system of universal health care]] and their commitment to multiculturalism.<ref name="bickerton">{{cite book |author=Bickerton, James & Gagnon, Alain-G & Gagnon, Alain (Eds). |title=Canadian Politics |publisher=Broadview Press |edition=4th edition |location=Orchard Park, NY |id=ISBN 1-55111-595-6 |year=2004}}</ref>

The country is a [[parliamentary democracy]] with a [[federation|federal system]] of [[Parliament|parliamentary government]] and strong democratic traditions.

[[Constitution of Canada|Canada's constitution]] consists of written text and unwritten traditions and conventions.<ref>{{cite web |author=Department of Justice |publisher= Department of Justice, Canada |url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/const/index.html |title=Constitution Acts 1867 to 1982|accessdate=2006-05-14}}</ref> The  [[Constitution Act, 1867]] (formerly the British North America Act) established governance based on Parliamentary precedent  "similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom" and divided powers between the federal and provincial governments. The [[Constitution Act, 1982]] added a [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], which guarantees basic rights and freedoms for Canadians that generally cannot be overridden by legislation of any level of government in Canada. However, a "[[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|notwithstanding clause]]", allows the federal parliament and the provincial legislatures to override certain sections of the Charter temporarily, for a period of five years.

[[Image:parliament2.jpg|thumb|left|The Chamber of the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]].]]The position of [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]], Canada's [[head of government]], belongs to the [[List of Prime Ministers of Canada|current leader]] of the political party that can obtain the confidence of a plurality in the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]]. Executive power is exercised by the Prime Minister and Cabinet ministers, all of whom are sworn into the [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada]] to become Ministers of the Crown and [[Responsible government| responsible]] to the elected [[House of Commons]]. The Prime Minister and Cabinet are formally appointed by the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] (who is the Monarch's representative in Canada). However, the Prime Minister chooses the Cabinet, and by convention, the Governor General respects the Prime Minister's choices. [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]] ministers are traditionally drawn from elected members of the Prime Minister's party in the House of Commons.  The Prime Minister exercises vast political power, especially in the appointment of government officials and [[Canadian civil service|civil servants]]. [[Michaëlle Jean]] has served as Governor General since [[September 27]], [[2005]], and [[Stephen Harper]], leader of the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]], has been Prime Minister since [[February 6]], [[2006]].

The [[Parliament of Canada|federal parliament]] is made up of the Queen and two houses: an elected House of Commons and an appointed [[Canadian Senate|Senate]]. Each member in the House of Commons is elected by [[plurality electoral system|simple plurality]] in a [[electoral district (Canada)|"riding" or electoral district]]; general elections are called by the Governor General when the Prime Minister so advises. While there is no minimum term for a Parliament, a new election must be called within five years of the last general election. Members of the Senate, whose seats are apportioned on a regional basis, are chosen by the Prime Minister and formally appointed by the Governor General, and serve until age 75.

Canada's four major political parties are the [[Conservative Party of Canada]], the [[Liberal Party of Canada]], the [[New Democratic Party]] (NDP), and the [[Bloc Québécois]]. The current government is formed by the Conservative Party of Canada. While the [[Green Party of Canada]] and other smaller parties do not have current representation in Parliament, the list of [[List of political parties in Canada#Historical parties that have won seats in Parliament|historical parties with elected representation]] is substantial.

== Law ==
{{main|Law of Canada}}
[[Image:Supreme Court of Canada.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in Ottawa, west of Parliament Hill.]]

Canada's [[judiciary]] plays an important role in interpreting laws and has the power to strike down laws that violate the Constitution.  The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] is the highest court and final arbiter and is led by the Right Honourable Madam Chief Justice [[Beverley McLachlin]], P.C. Its nine members are appointed by the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] on the advice of the Prime Minister. All judges at the superior and appellate levels are appointed by the Governor General on the advice of the prime minister and minister of justice, after consultation with non-governmental legal bodies. The federal cabinet appoints justices to superior courts at the provincial and territorial levels. Judicial posts at the lower provincial and territorial levels are filled by their respective governments (see [[Court system of Canada]] for more detail).

[[Common law]] prevails everywhere except in Quebec, where [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] predominates. [[Criminal law in Canada|Criminal law]] is solely a federal responsibility and is uniform throughout Canada. Law enforcement, including criminal courts, is a provincial responsibility, but in rural areas of all provinces except Ontario and Quebec, policing is contracted to the federal [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP).

Canada and the [[U.S.-Canada relations|United States]] share the world's longest undefended [[border]], co-operate on military campaigns and exercises, and are each other's largest trading partners. Canada has nevertheless maintained an independent foreign policy, most notably maintaining full relations with [[Cuba]] and declining participation in the [[Iraq War]]. Canada also maintains historic ties to the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]] and to other former British and French colonies through Canada's membership in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and [[La Francophonie]] (French-Speaking Countries). 

Canada currently employs a professional, volunteer military force of about 64,000 regular and 26,000 reserve personnel.<ref>{{cite web |author=Assistant Deputy Minister (Public Affairs) |authorlink=Department of National Defence (Canada) |publisher= Department of National Defence |url=http://www.forces.gc.ca/site/about/family_e.asp |title=The National Defence family|accessdate=2006-05-14}}</ref> The unified [[Canadian Forces]] (CF) comprise the [[Canadian Forces Land Force Command|army]], [[Canadian Forces Maritime Command|navy]], and [[Canadian Forces Air Command|air force]].

Strong attachment to the [[British Empire]] and Commonwealth in [[English Canada]] led to major participation in British military efforts in the [[Second Boer War]], the [[First World War]], and the [[Second World War]]. Since then, Canada has been an advocate for [[multilateralism]], making efforts to resolve global issues in collaboration with other nations.<ref name="canada_policy">

and has since maintained forces in international missions in the former [[Yugoslavia]] and elsewhere. 

Canada joined the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) in 1990 and hosted the OAS General Assembly in Windsor in June 2000, and the third Summit of the Americas in Quebec City in April 2001. Canada seeks to expand its ties to [[Pacific Rim]] economies through membership in the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] forum (APEC).

[[Image:Canadian soldiers afghanistan.jpg|thumb|right|Canadian soldiers in [[Canada's role in the invasion of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]].]]

Since 2001, Canada has had troops deployed in [[Afghanistan]] as part of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|US stabilization force]] and the UN-authorized, NATO-commanded [[International Security Assistance Force]]. Canada's [[Disaster Assistance Response Team]] (DART) has participated in three major relief efforts in the past two years; the two-hundred member team has been deployed in relief operations after the [[2004 tsunami|December 2004 tsunami]] in South Asia, the [[Hurricane Katrina]] in September 2005 and the [[2005 Kashmir earthquake|Kashmir earthquake]] in October 2005.

== Provinces and territories ==
{{main|Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian federalism}}
[[Image:Map Canada political-geo.png|thumb|left|A geopolitical map of Canada, exhibiting its [[Provinces and territories of Canada|ten provinces and three territories]].]]

Canada is a [[federation]] composed of ten [[province]]s and three [[Territory (country subdivision)|territories]]; in turn, these may be grouped into numerous [[region]]s. [[Western Canada]] consists of [[British Columbia]] and three [[Canadian Prairies|Prairie provinces]] ([[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]], [[Manitoba]]). [[Eastern Canada]] consists of [[Central Canada]] ([[Quebec]] and [[Ontario]]) and [[Atlantic Canada]] (comprised of the three [[Maritimes|Maritime provinces]] of [[New Brunswick]], [[Prince Edward Island]], and [[Nova Scotia]]; and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]).  Three territories ([[Yukon]], [[Northwest Territories]], and [[Nunavut]]) comprise [[Northern Canada]]. Provinces have a [[Canadian federalism|large degree of autonomy]] from the federal government,  territories somewhat less. Each has its own [[List of Canadian provincial and territorial symbols|provincial or territorial symbols]].

The provinces are responsible for most of Canada's social programs (such as [[Health care in Canada|health care]], [[Education in Canada|education]], and [[welfare (financial aid)|welfare]]) and together collect more revenue than the federal government, an almost unique structure among federations in the world. Using its spending powers, the federal government can initiate national policies in provincial areas, such as the [[Canada Health Act]]; the provinces can opt out of these, but rarely do so in practice. [[Equalization payments]] are made by the federal government to ensure that reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.

All provinces have [[unicameral]], elected [[Legislative Assemblies of Canada's provinces and territories|legislatures]] headed by a [[premier (Canada)|Premier]] selected in the same way as the Prime Minister of Canada. Each province also has a [[Lieutenant-Governor (Canada)|Lieutenant-Governor]] representing the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen]], analogous to the Governor General of Canada, appointed on the recommendation of the Prime Minister of Canada, though with increasing levels of consultation with provincial governments in recent years.

Canada occupies a major northern portion of [[North America]], sharing land borders with the [[contiguous United States]] to the south and with the [[U.S. state|US state]] of [[Alaska]] to the northwest, stretching from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the east to the [[Pacific Ocean]] in the west; to the north lies the [[Arctic Ocean]].

In eastern Canada, the Saint Lawrence River widens into the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]], the world's largest [[estuary]], that contains the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. South of the Gulf, the [[Canadian Maritimes]] protrude eastward along the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian Mountain]] range from northern [[New England]] and the [[Gaspé Peninsula]] of Quebec. [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]] are divided by the [[Bay of Fundy]], which experiences the world's largest tidal variations. [[Ontario]] and [[Hudson Bay]] dominate central Canada. West of Ontario, the broad, flat [[Canadian Prairies]] spread toward the [[Rocky Mountains]], which separate them from [[British Columbia]].

In western Canada, the [[Mackenzie River]] flows from the [[Great Slave Lake]] to the [[Arctic Ocean]].  A tributary of a tributary of the Mackenzie is the [[South Nahanni River]], which is home to [[Virginia Falls, Northwest Territories|Virginia Falls]], a waterfall about twice as high as [[Niagara Falls]].

[[Northern Canada|Northern Canadian]] vegetation tapers from [[coniferous]] forests to [[tundra]] and finally to Arctic barrens in the far north.  The northern Canadian mainland is ringed with a vast [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago|archipelago]] containing some of the [[List of islands by area|world's largest islands]].

Average winter and summer high temperatures across Canada vary depending on the location. Winters can be harsh in many regions of the country, particularly in the interior and Prairie provinces which experience a [[continental climate]], where daily average temperatures are near −15 °[[Celsius|C]] (5 °[[Fahrenheit|F]]) but can drop below −40 °C (−40 °F) with severe wind chills.<ref name="twn_regina">{{cite web |author=The Weather Network |authorlink=The Weather Network |publisher=The Weather Network |url=http://www.theweathernetwork.ca/weather/stats/pages/C02072.htm?CASK0261 |title=Statistics, Regina SK |accessdate=2006-05-18}}</ref> In non-coastal regions, snow can cover the ground almost six months of the year, (more in the north).  Coastal British Columbia is an exception and enjoys a temperate climate with a mild and rainy winter.

On the east and west coast average high temperatures are generally in the low 20s °C (70s °F), while between the coasts the average summer high temperature ranges from 25 to 30 °C (75 to 85 °F) with occasional extreme heat in some interior locations exceeding 40 °C (104 °F).<ref name="twn_vancouver">{{cite web |author=The Weather Network |authorlink=The Weather Network |publisher=The Weather Network |url=http://www.theweathernetwork.ca/weather/stats/pages/C02096.htm?CABC0308 |title=Statistics: Vancouver Int'l, BC |accessdate=2006-05-18}}</ref><ref name="twn_toronto">{{cite web |author=The Weather Network |authorlink=The Weather Network |publisher=The Weather Network |url=http://www.theweathernetwork.ca/weather/stats/pages/C02017.htm?CAON0696 |title=Statistics: Toronto Pearson Int'l |accessdate=2006-05-18}}</ref> For a more complete description of climate across Canada see Environment Canada's Website.<ref>{{cite web |author=Environment Canada |authorlink=Environment Canada |publisher= Environment Canada |url=http://www.climate.weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/climate_normals/index_e.html |title=Canadian Climate Normals or Averages 1971–2000|date=[[2004-02-25]]|accessdate=2006-05-18}}</ref><br clear="right">

Canada is one of the world's [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|wealthiest nations]] with a high per capita income, a member of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and [[Group of Eight]] (G8).

Since the early 1990's, the Canadian economy has been growing rapidly with low [[unemployment]] and large government surpluses on the [[Government of Canada|federal]] level. Today Canada closely resembles the US in its market-oriented economic system, pattern of production, and high living standards.<ref name="cia_factbook" /> While as of October 2007, Canada's national unemployment rate of 5.9% is its lowest in 33 years.

In the past century, the growth of the manufacturing, mining, and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural economy into one primarily industrial and urban. As with other [[first world nation]]s, the Canadian economy is dominated by the [[service industry]], which employs about three quarters of Canadians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/econ40.htm|publisher=Statistics Canada|title=Employment by Industry|date=2007-01-04}}</ref> However, Canada is unusual among developed countries in the importance of the [[primary industry|primary sector]], with the [[logging]] and [[petroleum|oil]] industries being two of Canada's most important.

Canada is highly dependent on [[international trade]], especially trade with the United States.

Canadian culture has historically been influenced by [[British people|British]], [[French people|French]], and [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] cultures and traditions. It has also been influenced by [[American culture]] because of its proximity and migration between the two countries. American media and entertainment are popular if not dominant in Canada; conversely, many Canadian cultural products and entertainers are successful in the US and worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |first=John D. |last=Blackwell |url=http://www.iccs-ciec.ca/blackwell.html#culture |title=Culture High and Low |year=2005 |accessdate=2006-03-15 |publisher=International Council for Canadian Studies World Wide Web Service}}</ref> Many cultural products are marketed toward a unified "North American" or global market.

The creation and preservation of distinctly Canadian culture are supported by federal government programs, laws and institutions such as the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC), the [[National Film Board of Canada]] (NFB), and the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC).<ref>{{cite web |author=National Film Board of Canada |authorlink=National Film Board of Canada |url=http://www.nfb.ca/atonf/organisation.php?v=h&lg=en |title=Mandate of the National Film Board |year=2005|accessdate=2006-03-15}}</ref> 

Canada is a geographically vast and ethnically diverse country. There are cultural variations and distinctions from province to province and region to region. Canadian culture has also been greatly influenced by immigration from all over the world. Many Canadians value [[multiculturalism]], and see Canadian culture as being inherently multicultural.<ref name="bickerton" /> Multicultural heritage is enshrined in [[Section Twenty-seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 27 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].  

[[Image:RCMP officer Expo 67.jpg|thumb|The [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], seen here at [[Expo 67]], are the federal and national police force of Canada and an international icon.]]
[[National symbols of Canada|National symbols]] are influenced by natural, historical, and [[First Nations]] sources. Particularly, the use of the [[maple leaf]] as a Canadian symbol dates back to the early 18th century and is depicted on its [[Flag of Canada|current]] and [[Canadian Red Ensign|previous]] flags, the [[penny (Canadian coin)|penny]], and on the [[Coat of Arms of Canada|coat of arms]].<ref name="symbol1">{{cite book | author=Canadian Heritage | title=Symbols of Canada | year=2002 | location=Ottawa, ON | id=ISBN 0-660-18615-2 | publisher=Canadian Government Publishing}}</ref> Other prominent symbols include the [[beaver]], [[Canada goose]], [[common loon]], [[Monarchy in Canada|the Crown]], and the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|RCMP]].<ref name="symbol1"/>

Canada's two official languages are  [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]]. [[Bilingualism in Canada|Official Bilingualism in Canada]] is law, defined in the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], the [[Official Languages Act (Canada)|Official Languages Act]], and ''Official Language Regulations''; it is applied by the [[Commissioner of Official Languages]]. English and French have equal status in federal courts, Parliament, and in all federal institutions. The public has the right, where there is sufficient demand, to receive federal government services in either English or French, and official language minorities are guaranteed their own schools in all provinces and territories.<ref>{{cite web|title=Federal Legislation on Official Languages|publisher=Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages|date=2003-09-01|url=http://www.ocol-clo.gc.ca/legislation.asp?Lang=English}}</ref>

Although 85% of French-speaking Canadians live in Quebec, there are substantial Francophone populations in [[Franco-Ontarian|Ontario]], [[Franco-Albertan|Alberta]] and southern [[Franco-Manitoban|Manitoba]], with an [[Acadian]] population in the northern and southeastern parts of [[New Brunswick]] constituting 35% of that province's population as well as concentrations in Southwestern [[Nova Scotia]] and on [[Cape Breton Island]]. Ontario has the largest French population outside Quebec. The [[Charter of the French Language]] in Quebec makes French the official language in Quebec, and New Brunswick is the only province to have a statement of official bilingualism in the constitution.<ref>{{cite web|title=Canadian Heritage|publisher=Canadian Heritage|url=http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/progs/lo-ol/pubs/mythes/english/abc.html}}</ref> Other provinces   have no official language(s) as such, but French is used as a language of instruction, in courts, and other government services in addition to English. Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec allow for both English and French to be spoken in the provincial legislatures, and laws are enacted in both languages. In Ontario, French has some legal status but is not fully co-official. Several aboriginal languages have official status in Northwest Territories. [[Inuktitut]] is the majority language in Nunavut, and one of three official languages in the territory.

Non-official languages are important in Canada, with 5,202,245 people listing one as a first language.<ref name="statscan_language" /> Some significant non-official first languages include [[Chinese language|Chinese]] (853,745 first-language speakers), [[Italian language|Italian]] (469,485), [[German language|German]] (438,080), and [[Punjabi]] (271,220).<ref name="statscan_language" />
