By [[1987]], he held the rank of Brigadier-General, and was the Commander of the Royal Fiji Military Forces.  While visiting Australia, he was deposed from this position, however, when the third-ranked officer, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Sitiveni Rabuka]] staged [[Fiji coups of 1987|the first of two coups]] and seized power.

In the aftermath of the failure of the [[Fiji coup of 2000]], a coup which Nailatikau strongly opposed, he was nominated for the position of [[List of Prime Ministers of Fiji|Prime Minister]], to help rebuild Fiji's shattered institutions.

On [[14 June]] [[2005]], Nailatikau was appointed the [[UNAIDS]] Special Representative for the Pacific.

He has previously served as a UNAIDS Pacific spokesman, and in October[[2004]] chaired the first conference of Pacific Parliamentarians on the Role of Pacific Parliamentarians in the fight against HIV/AIDS, in [[Suva]].

Nailatikau's outspoken calls to tackle the AIDS crisis have attracted controversy.  On [[22 November]] 2005, he called on people to recognize the reality that promiscuity existed, and that [[safe sex]] needed to be promoted to combat the associated AIDS risk.  It was unrealistic to deny promiscuity and just promote abstinence, he considered, adding that this was a matter of life and death.  He also called on churches to face the reality that promiscuity existed among their own congregations, and to meet the problem "head on" and play a part in promoting the use of condoms.

He represented the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA)[http://www.cpahq.org] at the World AIDS Conference in Toronto in August 2006.
