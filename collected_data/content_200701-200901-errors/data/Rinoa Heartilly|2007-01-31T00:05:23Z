{{nihongo|'''Rinoa Heartilly'''|リノア・ハーティリー|Rinoa Hātirī}} is the heroine of [[Square Co., Ltd.|Squaresoft's]] (now [[Square Enix]]) ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]''.  Born Rinoa Caraway, she has taken her mother's maiden name as her surname. She is the seventeen year old daughter of General Caraway, a high-ranking officer in the Galbadian army, and Julia Heartilly, a famous singer and former love interest of [[Laguna Loire]]. Rinoa's physical appearance is marked by black hair with blonde highlights and brown eyes.

== Development ==

When designing Rinoa, Nomura emphasized that he tried to avoid letting the possibilities presented by the recent advancements in FMV technology become the entire focus, believing that these innovations might tempt developers to make their female characters "too beautiful" and focus more on physical appearance than personality. With this concern in mind, Nomura set out with the intention to avoid making Rinoa gorgeous, and to simply make her "cute" instead. To further emphasise this, he wrote a list of vocabulary traits and physical habits for Rinoa's character that he felt conveyed this idea of "cute, not gorgeous," and sent them to Nojima along with the character's design.<ref name="shella">{{cite web | author=Shella | year=2003 | title=Tetsuya Nomura 20s | url=http://flaregamer.com/b2article.php?p=81&more=1 | work=[http://flaregamer.com FLAREgamer] | accessdate=13 April | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

==Final Fantasy VIII==

In the game, Rinoa is a member of the Forest Owls, a small resistance faction seeking to liberate the small nation of Timber from Galbadian occupation, She's often found planning their strategies and using military tactics learnt from her father.

Rinoa first meets Squall Leonhart, the protagonist of the game, at a ball at Balamb Garden. She has a positive attitude, and is bright as well as lively. She can easily guess what someone is thinking and uses it to charm anyone. During the dance, she manages to charm the usually taciturn and antisocial Squall into dancing with her. Meeting with Squall at the dance party changed everyone's fate. Her purpose for visiting the Garden is revealed when the Forest Owls hire Squall, Zell Dincht, and Selphie Tilmitt as mercenaries. Everyone is aware that she's very affectionate towards the people she knows. She stays with them as they are forced to flee Timber, and ends up traveling along with them for the remainder of the game.

Outspoken, spirited, emotional and compassionate, open and honest with her feelings, she speaks her mind without reservation. Driven by her ambition, she can be stubborn at times. Rinoa is in many ways the polar opposite of the cold and antisocial Squall; in fact, in the previous summer she was romantically involved with his long-standing rival Seifer Almasy. Together she and Squall go through many things, including Squall flying into space to rescue her from the sorceress' memorial and surviving time compression together. Although their personalities do clash at first, Squall and Rinoa gradually fall in love, and their relationship is a major focus of the game's storyline.

Rinoa's weapon of a choice is the Blaster Edge, a bladed ring mounted to her wrist that acts much like a boomerang. She is assisted by her faithful dog, Angelo, during battle. Due to events later in the game, she becomes a sorceress, acquiring a secondary limit break called Angel Wing, in which she becomes uncontrollable for the remainder of the battle, acting on her own by casting spells with greatly increased power.

==Other appearances==

Rinoa, along with [[Squall Leonhart|Squall]], is featured in the electronic board game, ''[[Itadaki Street Special]]''.

Although Rinoa didn't physically appear in the [[Kingdom Hearts series]] (so far), it is worth noting that she may exist. During the ending credits of ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', Squall is seen with an envelope. When he opens it, something bearing resemblance to Rinoa's signature wings insignia (the ones seen on the back of her sweater coat in ''Final Fantasy VIII'') magically fly out. However, they are shaped more like the wings found on the back of Squall's jacket in the Kingdom Hearts series.

Though not a genuine "appearance," Rinoa is paid an homage of sorts in Square-Enix's ''[[Star Ocean 3|Star Ocean 3: Til the End of Time]]''.  One of [[Maria Traydor]]'s extra costumes very closely resembles Rinoa's style of clothing and Maria's hair changes color to black.

==Controversy==

Rinoa is a relatively controversial character among ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' fans.  Opinion of her has tended to polarize into that which views her as an example of the stereotypical [[princess]] of slang terminology (she is referenced in the game as such on more than one occasion), and that which accepts Rinoa's character flaws as part of a more realistic and interesting whole, citing the game's portrayal of her growing relationship with Squall whom, it is contended, required someone as intense as Rinoa to develop his own personality. Some fans liken Squall and Rinoa's relationship to [[Cloud Strife]] and [[Aerith Gainsborough]]'s of ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' because their personalities and roles are mirrored.
