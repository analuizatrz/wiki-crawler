The '''Animal Liberation Front''' (ALF) is a name used internationally by [[Animal rights|animal liberation]] activists who engage in [[direct action]] on behalf of animals. This includes removing animals from laboratories or [[Fur farming|fur farms]], and [[sabotage|sabotaging]] facilities involved in [[animal testing]] and other animal-based industries. According to ALF statements, any direct action that furthers the cause of animal liberation, where all reasonable precautions are taken not to endanger life, may be claimed as an ALF action.<ref name=Best8>[[Steven Best|Best, Steven]] & Nocella, Anthony J. (eds), ''Terrorists or Freedom Fighters?'', [[Lantern Books]], 2004, p. 8.</ref>

The ALF is not a group with a membership, but an example of a [[leaderless resistance]]. It sees itself as the modern-day equivalent of the [[Underground Railroad]],<ref>*[[Rod Coronado|Coronado, Rod]].

A cell might consist of just one person. [[Robin Webb]], who runs the [[Animal Liberation Press Office]] in the UK, has said of this model of activism: "That is why the ALF cannot be smashed, it cannot be effectively infiltrated, it cannot be stopped.

The activists who speak on behalf of the ALF say that the movement is non-violent. In an interview for ''[[Behind the Mask (ALF)|Behind the Mask]]'', a 2006 documentary about the ALF, leading activist [[Rod Coronado]] said: "One thing that I know that separates us from the people we are constantly accused of being &mdash; that is, terrorists, violent criminals &mdash; is the fact that we have harmed no one."<ref name=Mask>''[[Behind the Mask (ALF)|Behind the Mask: The Story Of The People Who Risk Everything To Save Animals]]'', a film by [[Shannon Keith]], 2006.</ref> There has nevertheless been widespread criticism that ALF spokespersons have failed to condemn acts of violence. Groups such as the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC), which monitors U.S. domestic extremism, have noted the involvement of ALF activists in the [[Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty]] campaign, which SPLC identifies as using "frankly terroristic tactics similar to those of anti-abortion extremists."<ref name=SPLC2002>[http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=42 "From Push to Shove"], [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] Intelligence Report, Fall 2002.</ref> The ALF has been described as a domestic terrorist threat in the UK,<ref name=Dispatches1> "Inside the ALF", ''Dispatches'' with David Monagh, Channel 4 television, 1998. It is unclear whether Professor Wilkinson is referring to the ALF or to the [[Justice Department (animal rights)|Justice Department]] and the [[Animal Rights Militia]], names used by splinter groups with an unclear relationship to the ALF. In a report on terrorism discussed in the House of Commons, Wilkinson implies that the ALF, the Justice Department and the Animal Rights Militia are essentially the same. He writes: "The majority of those involved in the animal welfare lobby keep firmly within the law and abhor violence. However, a cluster of small groups such as the so-called Justice Department of the Animal Liberation Front, and the Animal Rights Militia, have crossed the threshold from extra-parliamentary protest and demonstrations to what can only be described as acts of terrorism; incendiary attacks on shops and other premises and letter and parcel bombs. In 1990 animal rights extremists used car bombs in two attacks on scientists, one in Bristol and one in Porton Down. In the former case the scientist was unhurt, but a 13 month old baby was injured by shrapnel. There were major firebomb attacks against shops in Newport, Isle of Wight, York and Harrogate, in 1994. Millions of pounds worth of damage has been caused over the past few years alone" (''Hansard'', December 14, 1992, column 223).</ref> and in January 2005, it was named as a terrorist threat by the United States [[Department of Homeland Security]].<ref name=CQ>Rood, Justin.

The ALF's stated aims are: 

{{Quotation|
::::*To inflict economic damage on those who profit from the misery and exploitation of animals.
[[Image:ALF logo.svg|left|70px|The ALF logo]]
::::*To liberate animals from places of abuse, i.e. laboratories, factory farms, fur farms etc., and place them in good homes where they may live out their natural lives, free from suffering.
::::*To reveal the horror and atrocities committed against animals behind locked doors, by performing nonviolent direct actions and liberations
::::*To take all necessary precautions against harming any animal, human and non-human.
::::*Any group of people who are vegetarians or vegans and who carry out actions according to ALF guidelines have the right to regard themselves as part of the ALF.<ref name=Best8>[[Steven Best|Best, Steven]] & Nocella, Anthony J. (eds), ''Terrorists or Freedom Fighters?'', [[Lantern Books]], 2004, p. 8.</ref>}}

Activists interviewed by animal rights lawyer [[Shannon Keith]] for her documentary ''[[Behind the Mask (ALF)|Behind the Mask]]'', a film about the animal liberation movement, say that, for animals, the ALF is the "modern-day equivalent of the [[Underground Railroad]]," the network of clandestine routes and safe houses used by slaves in the U.S. to escape to free states or to Canada.<ref name=Keith>Keith, Shannon. ''Behind the Mask'', ''Uncaged Films'', 2006.</ref> [[Ingrid Newkirk]] of [[PETA]] told Keith: "That means they must not take any credit for their rescues. They must remain anonymous."<ref name=Keith/>

Founded in the UK in 1976, ALF cells are now active in around 35 countries, including in North and South America, Australia and New Zealand, Russia, South Africa, Turkey, Israel, Iceland, and most European countries.<ref>ALF cells are known to be active in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Belarus, Canada, Canary Islands, Chile, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Holland, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States. See [http://www.directaction.info/news.htm "Diary of Actions"], ''Bite Back'', March 23, 2007.</ref> The movement is entirely decentralized, with no formal membership or hierarchy, which acts as a firebreak when it comes to determining legal responsibility. "There is no office, there is no structure," said one activist on ''Behind the Mask''. "That's why the FBI is so frustrated, because they can't get their hands on it."<ref name=Keith/> Any [[Veganism|vegan]] or [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]] who wants to take action in the name of the ALF may do so, so long as it is consistent with ALF principles. [[Robin Webb]] writes that ALF activists are "from all walks of life and social background, of all ages, of all beliefs and none."<ref name=Best75>[[Robin Webb|Webb, Robin]].

[[Steven Best]], professor of philosophy at the [[University of Texas at El Paso]] and a press officer with the [[Animal Liberation Press Office]], describes ALF activism:

{{Quotation|ALF activists operate under cover, at night, wearing [[balaclava]]s and ski masks, and in small cells of a few people. After careful [[reconnaissance]], skilled liberation teams break into buildings housing animal prisoners in order to release them (e.g. [[mink]] and [[coyote]]s) or rescue them (e.g. cats, dogs, mice, and guinea pigs). They seize and/or destroy equipment, property, and materials used to exploit animals, and they use [[arson]] to raze buildings and laboratories. They have cost the animal exploitation industries hundreds of millions of dollars. They willfully break the law, because the law wrongly consigns animals to cages and confinement, to loneliness and pain, to torture and death.|[[Steven Best]], ''Terrorists or Freedom Fighters, p. 11.}}

Activists claim actions on behalf of the ALF anonymously by contacting one of the animal liberation press offices<ref>[http://www.animalliberationpressoffice.org Animal Liberation Press Office]</ref> or ''[[Bite Back]]'', the direct-action magazine,<ref>[http://www.directaction.info "Bite Back"]</ref> or by leaving a communication at the location of the action. The press offices are run by [[Robin Webb]] in the UK and by trauma surgeon [[Jerry Vlasak]] in North America. 

Although the ALF itself has no formal existence, a sister organization called the [[Animal Liberation Front Supporters Group]]<ref>[http://www.alfsg.org.uk/index2.html Animal Liberation Supporters Group website]</ref> exists to support activists who are jailed for actions performed in the name of the ALF. Some leading ALF activists also run an Animal Liberation Front website.<ref>[http://www.animalliberationfront.com Animal Liberation Front website]</ref>

==Origins==
===United Kingdom===
[[Image:RonnieLeeALF.jpg|right|thumb|British animal rights activist [[Ronnie Lee]] founded the ALF in 1976.]] 
The ALF's roots can be traced to 19th century England, and a small group of activists called the Bands of Mercy, which was set up in 1824 to thwart [[Fox hunting|fox hunters]].<ref name=Best19>[[Steven Best|Best, Steven]] in Best & Nocella (eds), ''Terrorists or Freedom Fighters, Lantern Books, 2004, p. 19.</ref> In 1965, the group was re-created, this time called the Hunt Saboteurs Association; it laid false scents, blew hunting horns to send the hounds in the wrong direction, set off smoke bombs, and members lay down between the hunters and the fox.

In 1972, activists [[Ronnie Lee]] and Cliff Goodman revived the 19th century name and set up the Band of Mercy, a more militant group, which attacked hunters' vehicles by slashing tires and breaking windows. They progressed to attacking pharmaceutical laboratories and [[Seal hunting|seal-hunting]] boats. On [[November 10]], [[1973]], they set fire to a building in [[Milton Keynes]], as part of a strategy to make insurance prohibitive for what they saw as exploitative industries, and thus began a campaign of arson that continues to this day.<ref name=Best20>[[Steven Best|Best, Steven]] in Best & Nocella (eds), ''Terrorists or Freedom Fighters, Lantern Books, 2004, p. 20.</ref>

In August 1974, Lee and Goodman were arrested for allegedly taking part in a raid on Oxford Laboratory Animal Colonies in Bicester, which earned them the name the "Bicester Two." They were sentenced to three years in prison, but released after serving one.

After his release, Goodman allegedly became the first-ever police informer on the animal liberation movement, whereas Lee emerged from prison more militant than before.<ref name=Best20/> He organized 30 activists to set up a new liberation campaign, and in 1976, in order to show that the new campaign was prepared to intimidate but was also compassionate, he named it the Animal Liberation Front.<ref name=Best20/>

===United States===
There are conflicting accounts of when the ALF first emerged in the United States. The FBI writes that ALF activists have a history of committing "low-level criminal activity" in the U.S. dating back to the 1970s.<ref name=FBI/> Freeman Wicklund and Kim Stallwood say the first ALF action there was on [[May 29]], [[1977]], when researchers Ken LeVasseur and Steve Sipman released two dolphins, Puka and Kea, into the ocean at Yokohama Bay, [[Oahu]], [[Hawaii]], from captivity in the [[University of Hawaii]]'s Marine Mammal Laboratory.<ref name=Best21>[[Steven Best|Best, Steven]] in Best & Nocella (eds), ''Terrorists or Freedom Fighters, Lantern Books, 2004, p. 21.</ref><ref>Vorsino, Mary.

The North American Animal Liberation Press Office attributes the dolphin release to a group called Undersea Railroad,<ref name=ALPOhistory>[http://www.animalliberationpressoffice.org/history.htm#guide "History of the Animal Liberation Movement"], North American Animal Liberation Press Office.</ref> and says the first ALF action was in fact a raid on the New York University Medical Center on [[March 14]], [[1979]],<ref name=ALPOhistory/> when activists removed one cat, two dogs, and two guinea pigs. [[Ingrid Newkirk]], the president of [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]], says that the first ALF cell in the U.S. was set up in late 1982, with the first raid taking place on December 24 that year on [[Howard University]], when 24 cats were removed, some of whose back legs had been crippled in an experiment.<ref>Newkirk 2000.</ref><ref name=Best21/>

Two early ALF raids led to the closure of two university laboratories. A raid on [[May 28]], [[1984]] on the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s head injury clinic caused $60,000 worth of damage and saw the removal of 60 hours of research tapes.<ref name=Best22>[[Steven Best|Best, Steven]] in Best & Nocella (eds), ''Terrorists or Freedom Fighters, Lantern Books, 2004, p. 22.</ref>The tapes showed researchers laughing and joking as they used a hydraulic device to cause brain damage to [[baboon]]s.<ref>The video footage released by PETA can be viewed at [http://www.animalliberationfront.com/MediaCenter/UnnFuss.wmv Unnecessary Fuss 1] [http://www.animalliberationfront.com/MediaCenter/UnnFuss00.wmv Unnecessary Fuss 2] [http://www.animalliberationfront.com/MediaCenter/UnnFuss01.wmv Unnecessary Fuss 3] [http://www.animalliberationfront.com/MediaCenter/UnnFuss02.wmv Unnecessary Fuss 4] [http://www.animalliberationfront.com/MediaCenter/UnnFuss03.wmv Unnecessary Fuss 5] (videos).</ref> The tapes were turned over to [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]], who edited the content and added voiceover commentary to produce a 26-minute video called ''[[Unnecessary Fuss]]''. The ensuing publicity led to the closure of the head injury clinic.<ref>On the basis of ''[[Unnecessary Fuss]]'', PETA petitioned the Office for Protection from Research Risks (OPRR) to have the University of Pennsylvania's head injury lab closed down. The OPRR initially refused to act on the basis of edited material and after more than a year of refusing to turn over the original tapes, PETA eventually did so. The edited tape was found to have "grossly overstated the deficiencies in the Head Injury Clinic", but OPRR also found serious violations of accepted procedure. As a result, the head injury clinic was closed, the university's chief veterinarian was fired, the university was put on probation, the administration of the program was reorganized, and new training programs for staff were instituted.

Retrieved October 2, 2006).</ref>

On [[April 20]], [[1985]], the ALF raided a [[University of California, Riverside]] laboratory and removed hundreds of animals, including [[Britches (monkey)|Britches]], a five-week old [[macaque]] monkey who had been separated from his mother at birth, and left alone in a wire cage with his eyes sewn shut as part of a study into blindness. As a result of the raid, which was recorded by the ALF ([http://www.animalliberationfront.com/ALFront/Actions-USA/Britches.htm video]), eight of the 17 research projects active at the laboratory at the time of the raid were shut down.<ref name=Best22/>

==Direct action and attitude toward violence==
=== United Kingdom ===
[[Image:ALFattackpork.JPG|right|thumb|The aftermath of an ALF attack on Cherryfield Ltd, a pork producer in [[Croydon]], near London.]]

{{Animal rights}}

[[Robin Webb]] has written that, during the 1970s and early 1980s, the media portrayed animal rights activists in a positive light, as animal lovers who were merely eccentric and taking things a little too far: the "[[Robin Hood]]s of the animal welfare world."<ref name=Best77>[[Robin Webb|Webb, Robin]]. "Animal Liberation &mdash; By 'Whatever Means Necessary'," in Best & Nocella (eds), ''Terrorists or Freedom Fighters, Lantern Books, 2004, p. 77.</ref> [[Ronnie Lee]], the ALF's founder, wrote in ''Peace News'' in 1974 that direct action should be "limited only by reverence for life and hatred of violence,"<ref name=Best83>Stallwood, Kim. "A Personal Overview of Direct Action," in Best & Nocella (eds), ''Terrorists or Freedom Fighters, Lantern Books, 2004, p. 83.</ref> and in 1979 that the ALF "is not violent in that much care is taken to prevent injury to people and many raids have been called off because of possible confrontation."<ref name=Best83/> Lee later said that he regrets the decision to create the ALF as non-violent, and that he now believes "there would have been a place for limited violence against animal abusers."<ref name=Lee28>[[Ronnie Lee|Lee, Ronnie]]. [http://animalliberationfront.com/ALFront/Premise_History/RonnieLee_NoComp.htm "The Formation of the Band of Mercy and A.L.F."], ''No Compromise'', issue no. 28.</ref>

By the mid-80s, activists realized that economic sabotage was more effective than demonstrations and handing out leaflets. Activists moved on to smashing butchers' shop windows and setting fire to department stores that sold fur coats. British activist [[Keith Mann]] has said: "[W]e all desperately want to fight animal abuse legally. It just doesn't work like that. The people who run this country, they have shares, they have investments in pharmaceutical companies, for example, who are experimenting on animals, so to think that you can write to these people, and say 'we don't like what you're doing, we want you to change,' and expect them to do so, it's not going to happen."<ref name=Keith/>

In 1985, the [[Animal Rights Militia]] emerged, claiming responsibility for sending letter bombs to those involved in animal testing, and setting fire to stores on the Isle of Wight in 1994, causing £3 million worth of damages. [[Barry Horne]], who was a close friend of Webb's, was subsequently jailed for 18 years for the attacks, later dying in jail during a hunger strike; Webb himself was almost charged with conspiracy in connection with the attacks.<ref name=Best78>[[Robin Webb|Webb, Robin]]. "Animal Liberation &mdash; By 'Whatever Means Necessary'," in Best & Nocella (eds), ''Terrorists or Freedom Fighters, Lantern Books, 2004, p. 78.</ref>

In response to the emergence of this more violent strain of protest in the UK, the British police set up the Animal Rights National Index (ARNI) in or around 1985, which was intended to act as a liaison between the police and [[MI5]], the internal security service, which had started to monitor activists.

Violence against property began to increase substantially after several high-profile campaigns managed to close down a number of facilities perceived to be abusive to animals — [[Consort Kennels]], a facility breeding beagles for animal testing; [[Hillgrove Farm]], which bred cats, and [[Save the Newchurch Guinea Pigs|Newchurch Farm]], which bred guinea pigs, were all closed after being targeted by animal rights campaigns that appeared to involve the ALF. In the UK, the financial year 1991-1992 saw around 100 refrigerated meat trucks destroyed by incendiary devices at a cost of around £5 million. Butchers' locks were superglued, shrink-wrapped meats were pierced in supermarkets, slaughterhouses and refrigerated meat trucks were set on fire.<ref name=Best78>[[Robin Webb|Webb, Robin]]. "Animal Liberation &mdash; By "Whatever Means Necessary," in Best & Nocella (eds), ''Terrorists or Freedom Fighters'', Lantern Books, 2004, p. 78.</ref>

=== United States ===
According to the FBI, the ALF came to its attention in the late 1980s, after an arson attack in April 1985 on the veterinary medicine research building at the [[University of California, Davis]], which caused US$3.5 million damage.<ref name=FBI>[http://www.fbi.gov/publications/terror/terror2000_2001.htm#page_35 Trends in Animal Rights and Environmental Extremism"], Terrorism 2000/2001", Federal Bureau of Investigation.</ref> In August 1992, ALF activists raided [[Michigan State University]], setting fire to an office and destroying 32 years worth of toxicology and nutrition research. In July 1997, an arson attack at a horse rendering plant in [[Redmond, Oregon]], caused over $1 million in damage. In May 1998, the ALF claimed responsibility for an attack on a processing plant owned by Florida Veal Processors, Inc., in [[Wimauma, Florida]], causing $500,000 worth of damage.<ref name=FBI/> On [[December 5]], [[2007]], the ALF sent a letter claiming responsibility for a bomb hoax at the [[University of California, San Diego]]'s School of Medicine.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jose|last=Jimenez|title=FBI asks public's help in finding who planted fake bomb at UCSD |publisher=[[San Diego Union Tribune]]|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/metro/20071206-1832-bn06bombhoax.html|date=December 6, 2007|accessdate=December 6, 2007}}</ref>

===Evidence of increasingly violent attitude===
There is evidence that the ALF is increasingly moving towards more violent tactics. In 1999, ALF activists became involved in [[Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty]] (SHAC), an international campaign that aims to close [[Huntingdon Life Sciences]], Europe's largest animal-testing laboratory. The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]], which monitors U.S. domestic extremism, has described SHAC's ''modus operandi'' as "frankly terroristic tactics similar to those of anti-abortion extremists."<ref name=SPLC2002/> 

ALF activist Donald Currie was jailed for 12 years and placed on probation for life in December 2006 after being found guilty of planting homemade bombs on the doorsteps of businessmen with links to Huntingdon Life Sciences.<ref>Addley, Esther.

I have no sympathy for him."<ref>[http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=42 "From Push to Shove"], Southern Poverty Law Center, undated, retrieved [[2 October]], [[2006]].</ref> 

The ALF has made no secret of its commitment to SHAC. In May 2005, it issued a warning that direct action on behalf of the campaign:

{{Quotation|A new era has dawned for those who fund the abusers and raise funds for them to murder animals with. You too are on the hit list: you have been warned.

In June 2006, the ALF claimed responsibility for a firebomb attack on [[UCLA]] researcher Lynn Fairbanks. The Animal Liberation Press Office issued a statement saying that Fairbanks was conducting "painful addiction experiments" on monkeys,<ref>[http://www.animalliberationpressoffice.org/press_releases/pr_07_12_12_fairbanksucla.htm UCLA Vivisector Lynn Fairbanks Targeted by Animal Liberation Front], ''The Animal Liberation Press Office'', [[June 12]], [[2006]].

Accessed [[May 11]], [[2007]]</ref> A firebomb was placed on the doorstep of a house occupied by Fairbanks' 70 year-old neighbor and a tenant; according to the FBI, the device was lit, and was powerful enough to have killed the occupants, but it failed to ignite. The attack was credited by the acting chancellor of UCLA as helping to shape the [[Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act]], a bill before the U.S. Congress to give law enforcement officials more power when dealing with animal rights activism.<ref>Trounson, Rebecca & Mozingo, Joe.

===Extensional self-defense===
[[Steven Best]] recently coined the term "extensional self-defense" to describe actions carried out in defense of animals by human beings acting as "proxy agents."<ref name=BestLogic>[[Steven Best|Best, Steven]]. [http://www.drstevebest.org/papers/book_reviews/speciesism.php "Gaps in Logic, Lapses in Politics: Rights and Abolitionism in Joan Dunayer's Speciesism"], ''drstevebest.org''.</ref> He argues that, in carrying out acts of extensional self-defense, activists have the moral right to engage in acts of sabotage or even violence.<ref name=BestLogic/> Extensional self-defense is justified, he writes, because animals are "so vulnerable and oppressed they cannot fight back to attack or kill their oppressors."<ref name=BestVlasak>[[Steven Best|Best, Steven]]. [http://www.animalliberationpressoffice.org/Writings_Speeches/whos_afraid_of_jerry_vlasak.html "Who's Afraid of Jerry Vlasak?"], [[Animal Liberation Press Office]].</ref> Best argues that the principle of extensional self defense mirrors the penal code statues known as the "[[necessity defense]]," which can be invoked when a defendant believes that the illegal act was necessary to avoid imminent and great harm.<ref name=BestVlasak/> In testimony to the Senate in 2005, [[Jerry Vlasak]] stated that he regarded violence against Huntingdon Life Sciences as an example of extensional self-defense.<ref name=Miller>Miller, John J.

Whether there is any meaningful distinction between the ALF, ARM, RCALB and the Justice Department, in terms of the groups of people involved, is not known.

The Justice Department [[manifesto]], posted on the ALF website, says: "The Animal Liberation Front achieved what other methods have not while adhering to [[nonviolence]]. A separate idea was established that decided animal abusers had been warned long enough ... [T]he time has come for abusers to have but a taste of the fear and anguish their victims suffer on a daily basis."<ref>[http://animalliberationfront.com/Philosophy/AbuseLinked/justiced.htm The Justice Department] ''AnimalLiberationFront.com''. Accessed [[May 13]], [[2007]].</ref>

Robin Webb has said: "[If] someone wishes to act as the Animal Rights Militia or the Justice Department ... the third policy of the ALF [opposition to violence] no longer applies."<ref>[http://www.nocompromise.org/issues/22robin.html "Staying on Target and Going the Distance: An Interview with U.K. A.L.F. Press Officer Robin Webb"], ''No Compromise'', Issue 22. Retrieved October 2, 2006.</ref> He has said elsewhere that the "only difference between ALF and the more radical ones is that ALF basically takes every precaution not to endanger life at any time. The Animal Rights Militia are prepared to twist the arm of animal abusers".<ref>Naval Postgraduate School Monterey California Thesis, III. Testing the Fit: Threat Assessment of These Groups, B. Group two: Contemporary Single Issue Group, 2. The ALF Path to Terrorist Violence, Page 37</ref>  

Oren Segal, co-director of [[Anti-Defamation League|Anti-Defamation League's]] Center on Extremism, believes the ALF and RCALB consist of the same few "lone wolves", telling ''LA Weekly'', "the names are interchangeable...they’re going to rename themselves depending on what actions they’re doing." <ref name=LA>Range McDonald, Patrick, [http://www.laweekly.com/news/news/monkey-madness-at-ucla/16986/?page=1 Monkey madness at UCLA], ''LA Weekly'', August 8, 2007.</ref> Professor [[Paul Wilkinson]], former director of the [[University of St Andrews]] Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence, has written that the ALF, the Justice Department and the Animal Rights Militia are essentially the same. In a report on terrorism discussed in the House of Commons, Wilkinson argues that "a cluster of small groups such as the so-called Justice Department of the Animal Liberation Front, and the Animal Rights Militia, have crossed the threshold from extra-parliamentary protest and demonstrations to what can only be described as acts of terrorism; incendiary attacks on shops and other premises and letter and parcel bombs."<ref name=WilkinsonHansard>''Hansard'', December 14, 1992, column 223.</ref>

Wilkinson cites as examples two attacks on scientists in 1990 &mdash; one in Bristol, which led to no injuries, and one in Porton Down, in which a researcher's 13-month-old child was hurt by shrapnel &mdash; as well as firebomb attacks in 1994 against shops in Newport, Isle of Wight, York, and Harrogate, one of which ALF activist [[Barry Horne]] was convicted.<ref name=WilkinsonHansard/>

===Listing as a terrorist threat===
The ALF was named as a terrorist threat by the United States [[Department of Homeland Security]] in January 2005.<ref name=CQ/> In hearings held on [[May 18]], [[2005]] before a Senate panel, officials of the FBI and ATF stated that "violent animal rights extremists and [[eco-terrorism|eco-terrorists]] now pose one of the most serious terrorism threats to the nation," adding that "of particular concern are the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) and the [[Earth Liberation Front (ELF)]]."<ref name=cnnatf>[http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/05/19/domestic.terrorism/ FBI, ATF address domestic terrorism] ''CNN.com'', Terry Frieden, [[May 19]], [[2005]].</ref><ref>The FBI defines "domestic terrorism" as "activities that involve acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any state; appear to be intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; to influence the policy of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States." (18 U.S.C. § 2331(5)) [http://www.fbi.gov/publications/terror/terror2000_2001.htm]</ref>

The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] has criticized the Department of Homeland Security for concentrating on the Animal and Earth Liberation Fronts rather than on white supremacists, writing that "for all the property damage they have wreaked, eco-radicals have killed no one &mdash; something that cannot be said of the white supremacists and others who people the American radical right."<ref>[http://www.splcenter.org/center/splcreport/article.jsp?aid=164 "Decade of domestic terror documented by Center"], [[Southern Poverty Law Center]], September 2005. Retrieved October 2, 2006.</ref> Senator [[James Jeffords]] said that the "ELF and ALF may threaten dozens of people each year, but an incident at a chemical, nuclear or wastewater facility would threaten tens of thousands."<ref name=cnnatf />

In 1998, Professor [[Paul Wilkinson]], former director of the [[University of St Andrews]] Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence, said that the ALF and its splinter groups were the "most serious domestic terrorist threat within the United Kingdom." He told Channel 4's ''Dispatches'' that the ALF is "very close" to killing someone, adding: "[[Keith Mann]], who was sentenced to 11 years for his extremist violence, said in a message to ALF activists that sooner or later someone would die. He didn’t express any remorse about this or any regret. Now that does show to me a level of fanaticism which is very dangerous indeed."<ref name=Dispatches1/>''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' has called the ALF "the most active terrorist organisation in Britain."<ref>[http://www.opinion.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2006/02/21/dl2102.xml&sSheet=/opinion/2006/02/21/ixopinion.html  Terrorists in our midst]  ''The Telegraph'', [[21 February]], [[2006]].

===Operation Backfire===
{{main|Operation Backfire (FBI)}}
On [[January 20]], [[2006]], as part of ''[[Operation Backfire (FBI)|Operation Backfire]]'',  the U.S. Department of Justice announced charges against nine American and two Canadian activists calling themselves the "Family," who are alleged to have engaged in direct action in the name of the Animal Liberation Front and [[Earth Liberation Front]]. The Department of Justice called the acts examples of "domestic terrorism."

The incidents included arson attacks against meat-processing plants, lumber companies, a high-tension power line, and a ski center, in Oregon, Wyoming, Washington, California, and Colorado between 1996 and 2001.<ref>[http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2006/January/06_crm_030.html Eleven Defendants Indicted on Domestic Terrorism Charges] ''US Department of Justice'', [[January 20]], [[2006]].
