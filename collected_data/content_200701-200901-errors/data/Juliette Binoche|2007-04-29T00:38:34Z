'''Juliette Binoche''' (French [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|[ʒyli'jɛt bi'nɔʃ]}}) (born [[March 9]], [[1964]]) is a [[France|French]] [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning [[Actor|actress]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
'''Juliette Binoche''' was born in [[Paris]] on March 9 1964 to a sculptor father and an actress mother. At age 4 her parents were divorced and Binoche was dispatched to a boarding school with her sister Marion. She began acting in amateur stage productions, and at 17 she directed and starred in a student production of the [[Eugene Ionesco]] play, ''[[Le Roi se meurt]]''. The next year, she studied acting at the [[CNSAD|National Conservatory of Dramatic Arts of Paris]]. She found an agent through a friend, and joined a theatre troupe that toured France, Belgium and Switzerland under the pseudonym '''Juliette Adrienne'''.

After graduation, she followed her mother's footsteps and became a stage actress, occasionally taking bit parts in French feature films. Her first screen role was a small part in the 1983 TV film ''[[Dorothée, danseuse de corde]]'' by [[Jacques Fensten]] followed by a small part in the provincial TV film ''[[Fort bloque]]'' by [[Pierrick Guinnard]]. Binoche secured her first big screen appearance in [[Pascal Kané]]'s Algeria-themed ''[[Liberty Belle (film)|Liberty Belle]]''. At this point Binoche decided to pursue a career in cinema.

===1984 to 1991===
Small roles in ''[[Les Nanas]]'' (1984) and ''[[Adieu blaireau]]'' (1985) led to more significant exposure in [[Jean-Luc Godard]]'s ''[[Je Vous Salue, Marie (1985 movie)|Je Vous Salue, Marie]]'' and [[Jacques Doillon]]'s ''[[La Vie de Famille (film)|La Vie de Famille]]'' which cast her as the teenage step-daughter of [[Sami Frey]]'s character. This film was to set the theme and tone of the early career.

In 1985 Juliette Binoche secured the lead role in [[André Téchiné]]'s ''[[Rendez-vous (movie)|Rendez-vous]]''. The film premiered at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] that year, winning Best Director. In 1986 Binoche was nominated for her first [[César Award]] for Best Actress for the film. Binoche's next film was a role in ''[[Mon beau-frère a tué ma sœur]]'' by [[Jacques Rouffio]]. The film was a critical and commercial failure.

In 1986 Binoche starred opposite [[Michel Piccoli]] in [[Léos Carax]]'s ''[[Mauvais Sang (1986 film)|Mauvais Sang]]''. The film was a critical and commercial success leading to Binoche's second [[César Award]] nomination.

In August 1986 she won the role of Tereza in [[Philip Kaufman]]'s ''[[The Unbearable Lightness of Being (film)|The Unbearable Lightness of Being]]'' based on the [[Milan Kundera]] novel. This was Binoche's first English-language role and was a worldwide success with critics and audiences alike.

After her international success Binoche decided to return to France rather than pursue an international career. In 1988 she filmed the lead in [[Pierre Pradinas]]'s ''[[Un tour de manège]]'' (1989), a little-seen French film. Late in 1988 Binoche began work on [[Léos Carax]]'s ''[[Les Amants du Pont-Neuf]]''. The film was beset by problems and took three years to complete. When it was released in 1991 ''Les Amants du Pont-Neuf'' was a critical success. Binoche won a [[European Film Award]] for best actress as well as her third [[César Award]] nomination.

Juliette Binoche's early films saw her firmly established as a French star of some renown. The recurring themes of these films were of contemporary young women exploring their lives and their sexuality.

===1992 to 2000===
Following the long shoot of ''Les Amants du Pont-Neuf'' Binoche relocated to London for production of ''[[Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights]]'' (1992) and ''[[Damage (film)|Damage]]'' (1992) which considerably developed her international reputation. For ''Damage'' Binoche received her fourth [[César Award]] nomination.

In 1993 Binoche appeared in [[Krzysztof Kieslowski]]'s ''[[Trois Couleurs Bleu]]'' to much critical acclaim. The film premiered at the 1993 [[Venice Film Festival]]. The film also landed Binoche a [[César Award]] for Best Actress as well as a [[Golden Globe]] nomination.

Following this success Binoche took a short sabbatical during which she became mother of a son, Raphael.

In 1995 Binoche appeared in a big-budget adaptation of [[Jean Giono]]'s ''[[The Horseman on the Roof (1995)|Le Hussard sur le Toit]]'' directed by [[Jean-Paul Rappeneau]]. The film was a box-office success around the world and Binoche was again nominated for a [[César Award]] for Best Actress. This role as a romantic heroine was to color the direction of many of her roles in the late 1990s.

In 1996 Binoche appeared in ''[[A Couch in New York]]'' by [[Chantal Akerman]]. The film was a flop, but Binoche had another film that year to pin her hopes on. ''[[The English Patient (1996 movie)|The English Patient]]'', based on the acclaimed novel and directed by [[Anthony Minghella]], was a worldwide hit, garnering nine [[Academy Award]]s including best supporting actress for Juliette Binoche.

After this international hit Binoche returned to France where she reteamed with [[André Téchiné]] for ''[[Alice et Martin]]'' (1998) followed in 1999 by ''[[Les Enfants du Siècle (1999 film)|Les Enfants du Siècle]]'' in which Binoche played the role of 19th-century French writer [[George Sand]].

Late in 1999 Binoche gave birth to a second child, Hana.

2000 saw Binoche appear in four successful but different roles. Firstly was ''[[La Veuve de Saint-Pierre (2000 film)|La Veuve de Saint-Pierre]]'' (2000) by [[Patrice Leconte]] which saw Binoche nominated for a [[César Award]] for best actress.

Next she appeared in [[Michael Haneke]]'s ''[[Code Inconnu]]'', (2000), a film which was made following Binoche's approach to the Austrian director.

2000 was finished with a double success in the US. Binoche made her Broadway debut in [[Harold Pinter]]'s ''[[Betrayal (play)|Betrayal]]'' for which she was nominated for a [[Tony Award]].

Back on screen Binoche was the heroine of the [[Lasse Hallstrom]] film ''[[Chocolat (movie)|Chocolat]]'' (2000) for which she was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for Best Actress, a [[Bafta]] for Best Actress and won a [[European Film Award]] for Best Actress.

The 1990s saw Juliette Binoche rise to become a major European star around the world, specializing in intelligent and assured portrayals of women in love.

===2001 to 2006===
Following the success of ''Chocolat'', Juliette Binoche returned to France for an unlikely role. ''[[Décalage Horaire (movie)|Décalage Horaire]]'' (2002) opposite [[Jean Reno]] saw Binoche play a ditzy beautician. The film was a box-office hit in France and saw Binoche once again nominated for a [[César Award]] for best actress.

''Décalage Horaire'' was not to form the shape of Binoche's subsequent roles. Following instead from ''[[Code Inconnu]]'', which tackled racism, Binoche went to [[South Africa]] to film [[John Boorman]]'s ''[[In My Country]]'' (2004) opposite [[Samuel L. Jackson]].

Next came a reteaming with [[Michael Haneke]] for ''[[Caché (film)|Caché]]'' in (2005). The film was an immediate success, winning best director at the 2005 [[Cannes Film Festival]]. Binoche was nominated for a [[European Film Award]] for best actress for her role. Binoche's next film was ''[[Bee Season (film)|Bee Season]]'' with [[Richard Gere]].

''[[Mary 2005 (film)|Mary]]'' (2005) saw Binoche collaborate with [[Abel Ferrara]] for an investigation of modern faith and [[Mary Magdalene]]'s position in the [[Catholic Church]]. The film was an immediate success, winning the Grand Prix at the 2005 [[Venice Film Festival]].

2006 saw Binoche take part in the [[portmanteau]] work ''[[Paris, je t'aime]]'' appearing in a section directed by Nobuhiro Suwa. September 2006 saw Binoche at the [[Venice Film Festival]] to launch ''[[Quelques jours en septembre]]', by [[Santiago Amigorena]]. Later in the month she travelled to the [[Toronto Film Festival]] for the premiere of ''[[Breaking and Entering (film)|Breaking and Entering]]'', her second film with [[Anthony Minghella]] in the director's chair.

The 2000s have seen Binoche consolidate her position as that of a major French and international star while she found time to appear in works by some of cinema's great mavericks. Rather than continuing to explore the themes of women in love in romantic epics, Binoche has instead focused on political and social issues in her films.

===2007 onwards===
2007 will see Binoche appear in ''[[Le Voyage du Ballon Rouge]]'' by the Chinese director [[Hou Hsiao-Hsien]], ''[[Dan in Real Life]]'' with [[Steve Carrel]], ''[[Paris (film)|Paris]]'' by [[Cédric Klapisch]]. She is also due to film ''[[Désengagement (film)|Désengagement]]'' by [[Amos Gitai]], ''[[Souvenirs du Valois]]'' by [[Olivier Assayas]] and [[Rithy Panh]]'s ''[[Un Barrage Contre le Pacifique]]''.
