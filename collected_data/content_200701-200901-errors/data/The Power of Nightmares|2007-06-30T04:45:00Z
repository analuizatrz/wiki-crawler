'''''The Power of Nightmares''''' is a [[BBC]] [[documentary film]] series, written and produced by [[Adam Curtis]]. The series is subtitled ''The Rise of the Politics of Fear''. The film consists of three 1-hour parts, which were first broadcast in the UK in late 2004.

The film is arguably Curtis's most controversial film. It compares the rise of the American [[Neo-Conservative]] movement and the [[Islamist terrorism|radical]] [[Islamism|Islamist]] movement, makes comparisons on their origins and suggests a strong connection between the two. More importantly, it argues that the threat of radical Islamism as a massive, sinister organized force of destruction is in fact a myth perpetrated by the Neo-Conservatives in an attempt to unite and inspire their people following the failure of earlier, more [[utopian]] ideologies.

==Synopsis==

===Part 1 - Baby It's Cold Outside===
[[Image:Wolfowitz press briefing, Nov 2001.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Paul Wolfowitz. A leading Neo-Conservative and a prominent figure in Curtis's documentary.]]
The first part of the series explains the origins of [[Islamism]] and [[Neo-Conservatism]]. It shows [[Egypt]]ian civil servant [[Sayyid Qutb]], the founder of Islamism, visiting America to learn about the education system but becoming disgusted with what he saw as a corruption of morals and virtues in western society through individualism. When he returns to Egypt he is disturbed by westernization under [[Gamal Abdal Nasser|President Nasser]] and becomes convinced that in order to save society it must be completely restructured along the lines of [[Sharia|Islamic law]], although it still can utilize western technology. He also becomes convinced that this can only be accomplished through the use of an elite "vanguard" to lead a revolution against the established order. Qutb establishes the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], and after being tortured in one of Nasser's jails comes to believe that western-influenced leaders can justly be killed for the sake of removing their corruption. Qutb is executed in 1966, but he inspires the future mentor of [[Osama bin Laden]], [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], to start his own secret Islamist group. Inspired by the [[1979 Iranian revolution]], Zawahiri and his allies assassinate Egyptian president [[Anwar Al Sadat]] in 1981 in hopes of starting their own revolution. The revolution does not materialize, and Zawahiri comes to believe that the majority of Muslims have been corrupted by their western-inspired leaders and thus may be legitimate targets of violence if they do not join him.

At the same time in America, a group of disillusioned liberals including [[Irving Kristol]] and [[Paul Wolfowitz]] look to the political thinking of [[Leo Strauss]] after the general failure of [[Lyndon Johnson|President Johnson's]] "[[Great Society]]". They come to the conclusion that the emphasis on individual liberty was the undoing of the plan, and envision restructuring America by uniting the American people against a common enemy through fear. These factions, the Neo-Conservatives, come to power under the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration with their allies [[Dick Cheney]] and [[Donald Rumsfeld]] and work to unite the United States in fear and hatred of the [[Soviet Union]]. The Neo-Conservatives allege the Soviet Union is not following the terms of disarmament between the two countries, and with the investigation of "[[Team B]]" they accumulate a case to prove this with dubious evidence and methods. President Reagan is convinced nonetheless.<ref>[http://www.daanspeak.com/TranscriptPowerOfNightmares1.html Transcript: The Power of Nightmares - Part 1.] DaanSpeak.com. Retrieved on 2007-06-20.</ref>

The title of this episode is taken from [[Baby, It's Cold Outside (song)|a popular song]] which Qutb heard played at a church-organized dance for young people, which he saw as symptomatic of the immorality of American society.

===Part 2 - The Phantom Victory===
In the second episode, Islamist factions rapidly falling under the more radical influence of Zawahiri and his rich [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] acolyte Osama bin Laden join the Neo-Conservative-influenced Reagan Administration to combat the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet Union's invasion]] of [[Afghanistan]]. They are successful in repulsing the Soviet armies, and when the Eastern Bloc begins to collapse in the late 1980s both groups believe they were the primary architect of the "[[Evil Empire]]'s" defeat, and thus have the power to carry out their revolutions in their homelands. Curtis instead argues that the Soviets were on their last legs and were doomed to collapse without intervention.

Both factions' revolutions end in failure. The Neo-Conservatives' aspirations to use American power for further destruction of evil are thrown off track by the ascent of [[George H. W. Bush]] to the [[President of the United States|American Presidency]], followed by the 1992 election of Bill Clinton leaving them out of power. The Neo-Conservatives, with their conservative Christian allies, attempt to demonize Clinton throughout his presidency with various real and fabricated stories of corruption and immorality. To their disappointment, however, the American people do not acknowledge him as an enemy as they intended and remain indifferent to Clinton's alleged evils. The Islamist attempts at revolution end in massive bloodshed, leaving the Islamists without popular support. Zawahiri and bin Laden flee to the sufficiently safe Afghanistan and declare a new strategy; to fight Western-inspired moral decay they must deal a blow to its source: the United States.<ref>[http://www.daanspeak.com/TranscriptPowerOfNightmares2.html Transcript: The Power of Nightmares - Part 2.] DaanSpeak.com. Retrieved on 2007-06-20.</ref>

===Part 3 - The Shadows in the Cave===
[[Image:Ayman al Zawahiri.jpg|thumb|150px|Curtis argues that the forces under the direct command of Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri (pictured) are in fact very small and mainstream image of [[al-Qaeda]] is a myth.]]
The final episode addresses the actual rise of [[al-Qaeda]]. Curtis argues that after their failed revolutions bin Laden and Zawahiri had little or no popular support, let alone a serious complex organization of terrorists, and were dependent upon independent operatives to carry out their new call for jihad. The film instead shows the American government wanting to prosecute bin Laden in absentia for the [[1998 U.S. embassy bombings]], and needing to prove him to be the head of a criminal organization to do so. They find a former associate of bin Laden, [[Jamal al-Fadl]], and pay him to testify that bin Laden was the head of a massive terrorist organization called "al-Qaeda." With the [[September 11, 2001 attack|September 11th attacks]], Neo-Conservatives in the new Republican government of [[George W. Bush]] use this created concept of an organization to justify another crusade against a new evil enemy, leading to the launch of the [[War on Terrorism]].

After the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|American invasion of Afghanistan]] fails to uproot the alleged terrorist network, the Neo-Conservatives focus inwards, searching unsuccessfully for terrorist "[[sleeper cell]]s" in America. They then extend the war on "terror" to a war against general perceived evils with the invasion of [[Iraq]] in 2003. The ideas and tactics also spread to the [[United Kingdom]] where [[Tony Blair]] uses the threat of terrorism to give him a new moral authority. The repercussions of the Neo-Conservative strategy are also explored with an investigation of indefinitely-detained terrorist suspects in [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]], many alledgedly taken on the word of the anti-[[Taliban]] [[Northern Alliance]] without actual investigation on the part of the American military, and other forms of "[[preemption]]" against non-existent and unlikely threats made simply on the grounds that the parties involved could later become a threat. Curtis also makes a specific attempt to debunk fears of a [[dirty bomb]] attack, and concludes by reassuring viewers that politicians will eventually have to admit that their claims of threats are void of reality.<ref name="trans3">[http://www.daanspeak.com/TranscriptPowerOfNightmares3.html Transcript: The Power of Nightmares - Part 3.] DaanSpeak.com.

The title of this episode appears to refer to [[Plato's allegory of the cave]], which is mentioned in the course of this part of the film, and to the belief in the complex in [[Tora Bora]].

==Content==
Adam Curtis originally intended to create a film about conflict within the [[conservative]] movement between the ideologies of Neo-Conservative "elitism" and more [[individualism|individualist]] [[libertarian]] factions. During his research into the conservative movement, however, Curtis first saw similarities in the origins of the Neo-Conservative and Islamist ideologies. The topic of the planned documentary shifted to these latter two ideologies while the libertarian element was eventually phased out.<ref name="cinescope">Koehler, Robert.

===Criticisms===
Several American critics slammed ''The Power of Nightmares'' as [[anti-American]]. [[David Asman]] noted on the film at ''[[FoxNews.com]]'' that "We wish we didn't have to keep presenting examples of how the European media have become obsessively anti-American. But they keep pushing the barrier, now to the point of absurdity."<ref>[[David Asman|Asman, David]].

Accessed June 12, 2007.</ref> His views were shared by Clive Davis, concluding his commentary on the film for ''[[The National Review]]'' with "British producers, hooked on Chomskyite visions of "Amerika" as the fount of all evil, are clearly not interested in even beginning to dig for the truth."<ref name="Davis_NRO">Clive Davis, [http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/davis200410211043.asp "The Power of Bad Television,"] ''[[National Review Online]]'', 2004-10-21.

Other observers variously described the films as pushing a [[conspiracy theory]] or being generally out of touch with reality. Davis and British commentator [[David Aaronovitch]] both explicitly labeled the film's message as a conspiracy theory, with the latter saying of Curtis "his argument is as subtle as a house-brick."<ref name="Davis_NRO"/><ref>Aaronovitch, David.

Retrieved on 2007-06-06.</ref> Attacks in this vein continued after the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]], with CBN referencing the film as a source for claims by the "British left" that "the U.S. War on Terror was a fraud" and the [[AIJAC|Australia Israel & Jewish Affairs Council]] calling it "the loopiest, most extreme antiwar documentary series ever sponsored by the BBC."<ref name="AIJAC"/><ref name="cbn"/> In ''The Shadows in the Cave'' Curtis took the time to stress that he did not completely discount the possibility of any terrorist activity taking place, and responded to accusations of creating a conspiracy theory that he believes that the alleged use of fear as a force in politics is not the result of a conspiracy but rather the subjects of the film "have stumbled on it."<ref name="trans3"/><ref name="awakened"/>

[[Peter Bergen]], writing for the left wing magazine ''[[The Nation]]'', offered a detailed critique of the film. Bergen wrote that even if [[al-Qaeda]] is not as organized as the Bush Administration stresses, it is still a very dangerous force due to the fanaticism of its followers and the resources available to bin Laden. His own comment on Curtis's claim that al-Qaeda was legally invented by the Americans is "This is nonsense. There is substantial evidence that Al Qaeda was founded in 1988 by bin Laden and a small group of like-minded militants, and that the group would mushroom into the secretive, disciplined organization that implemented the 9/11 attacks."<ref>Bergen, Peter.
