'''Hurricane Florence''' was the third of four named [[Atlantic hurricane|tropical cyclones]] to make [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] on the [[United States]] during the [[1988 Atlantic hurricane season]]. The seventh tropical storm and second hurricane of the season, Florence developed on [[September 7]] from an area of convection associated with a dissipating [[surface weather analysis|frontal]] [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] in the southern [[Gulf of Mexico]]. After initially moving eastward, the storm turned northward and strengthened. Florence reached hurricane status and later peak winds of 80&nbsp;mph (130&nbsp;km/h) on [[September 9]] shortly before striking southeastern [[Louisiana]]. The storm rapidly weakened over land and dissipated on [[September 11]] over northeastern [[Texas]].

Early in its duration, the storm dropped rainfall across the [[Yucatán Peninsula]]. Upon striking [[Louisiana]], Florence produced a moderate [[storm surge]] causing severe beach erosion in some locations. Gusty winds were also reported, causing power outages to over 100,000&nbsp;people. In [[Alabama]], one man died while trying to secure his boat. Rainfall from the hurricane caused severe river flooding in portions of the [[Florida Panhandle]] in an area already severely affected by heavy rainfall; the flooding damaged or destroyed dozens of houses in [[Santa Rosa County, Florida|Santa Rosa County]]. Throughout its path, damage totaled about $2.9&nbsp;million (1988&nbsp;USD, $4.9&nbsp;million 2006&nbsp;USD).

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Florence 1988 track.png}}
On [[September 4]], a [[Surface weather analysis|cold front]] exited the coast of [[Texas]] into the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. A [[convection|convective]] band from the front continued southeastward and stalled between [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz, Mexico]] and [[Tampa, Florida]]. The band began to split into two on [[September 6]]; the northeastern portion developed into a frontal wave and tracked northeastward, while the southwestern portion remained nearly stationary and began showing signs of [[tropical cyclogenesis|tropical organization]]. Located in an area of generally [[low pressure area|low pressures]], the system developed a [[tropical cyclone#structure|spiral band structure]], though deep convection was mostly intermittent. Subsequent to the formation of a surface circulation, the system developed into a tropical depression while located about 450&nbsp;miles (725&nbsp;km) northwest of [[Mérida, Yucatán]].<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|year=1988|title=Hurricane Florence Preliminary Report|accessdate=2007-03-03|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1988-prelim/florence/prelim01.gif}}</ref>

The depression drifted eastward under the influence of the dissipating frontal [[trough (meteorology)|trough]], and intensified into Tropical Storm Florence to the north of the [[Yucatán Peninsula]], as confirmed by [[Hurricane Hunters]].<ref name="tcr"/> Initially, the center was located to the north of the deep convection, with only one weak [[tropical cyclone#structure|rainband]] to the north of the circulation.<ref name="ssmi">{{cite web|author=Randall J.

On [[September 9]], the influence of a mid- to upper-level trough to its north caused Florence to accelerate northward. Steadily intensifying, Florence attained hurricane status while located about 100 miles (165 km) south of the mouth of the [[Mississippi River]]. The hurricane intensified slightly further, and struck the western [[Mississippi River Delta]] with winds of 80&nbsp;mph (130&nbsp;km/h) at 0200 [[UTC]] on [[September 10]].<ref name="tcr"/> Upon making landfall, dry air became entrained in the circulation,<ref name="ssmi"/> and Florence rapidly weakened over southeastern [[Louisiana]]. By the time it passed over [[New Orleans]] and [[Lake Ponchartrain]] most convection had dissipated, and about 10&nbsp;hours after making [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] Florence degenerated into a tropical depression. The system subsequently crossed over southwestern [[Mississippi]] as it turned northwestward, and later entered northern [[Louisiana]] before dissipating over northeastern [[Texas]] on [[September 11]].<ref name="tcr"/> The mid-level circulation turned northeastward through the central United States before dissipating over [[Ohio]] on [[September 13]].<ref name="rain">{{cite web|author=David Roth|year=2005|title=Rainfall Summary for Hurricane Florence|publisher=Hydrometeorological Prediction Center|accessdate=2007-03-04|url=http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/rain/florence1988.html}}</ref>

==Preparations==
On [[September 9]], about 16&nbsp;hours before Florence made landfall, the [[National Hurricane Center]] issued a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|hurricane watch]] from [[Port Arthur, Texas]] to [[Pensacola, Florida]]. Three hours later, the watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning from Pensacola to [[Cameron, Louisiana]], with a tropical storm warning issued from Pensacola eastward to [[Apalachicola, Florida]]. Around the time of Florence moving ashore, the National Hurricane Center limited the hurricane warning from Pensacola, Florida to [[Morgan City, Louisiana]]. Hours after the hurricane made landfall the warning was replaced by a tropical storm warning from [[Mobile, Alabama]] to [[Grand Isle, Louisiana]], and was discontinued two hours later.<ref name="tcr12">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|year=1988|title=Hurricane Florence Watches and Warnings|accessdate=2007-03-04|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1988-prelim/florence/prelim12.gif}}</ref>

Prior to the arrival of the hurricane, an estimated 20,000&nbsp;people evacuated the coastal parishes of southeastern [[Louisiana]], including nearly all of the 2,000&nbsp;residents on [[Grand Isle, Louisiana|Grand Isle]]. Small-scale evacuations were issued for residents living in low-lying or coastal areas of [[Mississippi]] and [[Alabama]].<ref name="tcr3">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|year=1988|title=Hurricane Florence Preliminary Report Page 3|accessdate=2007-03-04|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1988-prelim/florence/prelim03.gif}}</ref> Offshore, the threat of the hurricane prompted oil companies to evacuate employees on oil rigs to the mainland.<ref name="ap914">{{cite news|author=Staff Writer|date=1988-09-14|title=Americans on Gulf Coast are Ready to Flee Storm|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=2007-03-04|url=http://www.thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=27334849&firstvisit=true&currentResult=0&currentPage=0}}</ref>

The threat of the hurricane caused [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] [[U.S. presidential election, 1988|presidential nominee]] [[Michael Dukakis]] to cancel a rally and two fund-raising events in [[New Orleans]]. [[Governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[Buddy Roemer]] issued for the Louisiana [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] to stand by for emergency duty.<ref name="nyt910">{{cite news|author=Frank Narcus|date=1988-09-10|title=Hurricane Sweeping In, Louisianians Flee North|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2007-03-04}}</ref> Officials closed several bridges across southeastern Louisiana, and also canceled ferries across [[Lake Ponchartrain]].

==Impact==
[[Image:Florence1988rain.gif|right|thumb|280px|Rainfall Summary for Hurricane Florence]]
The primary [[tropical cyclone#structure|rainband]] extending southward from the circulation of Florence dropped moderate rainfall across the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] and through southern [[Mexico]]. Rainfall amounts peaked at 10.79&nbsp;inches (274&nbsp;mm) in [[San Baltazar Loxicha, Guerrero]], with 10.67&nbsp;inches (271&nbsp;mm) reported in southeastern [[Chiapas]] and 9.74&nbsp;inches (247&nbsp;mm) near [[Merida, Yucatán|Merida]]. Damage, if any, is unknown.<ref name="rain"/>

Upon making landfall on [[Louisiana]], Hurricane Florence produced higher than normal [[storm tide|tides]], including a peak observation of 7.5&nbsp;feet (2.3&nbsp;m) above mean sea level on the [[Bayou Benvenue]] to the east of [[New Orleans]]. Rainfall was relatively light, ranging from about 1&nbsp;inch (25&nbsp;mm) to a maximum of 4.05&nbsp;inches (103&nbsp;mm) at [[Watson, Louisiana|Watson]].<ref name="tcr2">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|year=1988|title=Hurricane Florence Preliminary Report Page 2|accessdate=2007-03-04|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1988-prelim/florence/prelim02.gif}}</ref> Winds of tropical storm force occurred across southeastern Louisiana, with wind gusts peaking at 64&nbsp;mph (103&nbsp;km/h) at an automatic [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard Station]] on the Southwest Pass of the [[Mississippi River Delta]].<ref name="tcr10">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|year=1988|title=Hurricane Florence Preliminary Report Page 10|accessdate=2007-03-04|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1988-prelim/florence/prelim10.gif}}</ref> An unofficial tornado was reported in [[Tangipahoa Parish, Louisiana|Tangipahoa Parish]].<ref name="ap911">{{cite news|author=Staff Writer|date=1988-09-11|title=Residents Go Home as Storm Fizzles|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=2007-03-04|url=http://www.thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=27200399&firstvisit=true&currentResult=5&currentPage=0}}</ref> Minor [[storm surge]] flooding occurred outside of the [[levee]] system of southern [[Louisiana]] in [[Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana|Plaquemines]], [[Saint Bernard Parish, Louisiana|Saint Bernard]], and [[Saint Tammany Parish, Louisiana|Saint Tammany Parishes]]. On [[Grand Isle, Louisiana|Grand Isle]], strong wave action resulted in significant beach erosion, with most areas on the island losing about 40&nbsp;feet (12.2&nbsp;m) of beach.<ref name="tcr3"/> The storm surge also flooded a portion of [[Louisiana Highway 300]] near [[Delacroix, Louisiana|Delacroix]].<ref name="lahis">{{cite web|author=David Roth|year=2003|title=Louisiana Hurricane History: Late 20th Century|publisher=National Weather Service|accessdate=2007-03-04|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/lch/research/lalate20hur2.php}}</ref> The passage of the hurricane broke a levee in [[Delacroix, Louisiana|Delacroix]]; it was quickly repaired with flooding from the levee being pumped to the gulf.<ref name="ap912">{{cite news|author=Mary Foster|date=1988-09-12|title=Gulf Coast Residents Mop Up After Florence|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=2007-03-04}}</ref> Light to moderate damage was reported across the southeastern portion of the state, primarily from falling trees. The winds also downed numerous power lines, leaving about 150,000 without power for some period of time during the storm.<ref name="tcr3"/> The power outages were short-lived, with about 6,900 left without power by the day after the hurricane.<ref name="ap911"/> Damage in the state was fairly minor, totaling about $2.5&nbsp;million (1988&nbsp;USD, $4.3&nbsp;million 2006&nbsp;USD).<ref name="lahis"/>

Rainfall from Florence reached over 7&nbsp;inches (178&nbsp;mm) at one location in southeastern [[Mississippi]], while a station 3&nbsp;miles (4.8&nbsp;km) south-southeast of [[Brewton, Alabama]] reported a storm-wide peak rainfall total of 10.67&nbsp;inches (271&nbsp;mm).<ref name="rain"/> Despite the rainfall, no damage was reported in Alabama or Mississippi. In [[Mobile Bay]] in Alabama, one man died while attempting to secure his boat &mdash; the only direct fatality related to the hurricane.<ref name="tcr3"/>

Heavy rainfall was reported along the [[Florida Panhandle]], peaking at over 10&nbsp;inches (254&nbsp;mm) in the extreme northwestern portion of the state. The rainfall caused the worst flooding in 10&nbsp;years, and resulted in additional flooding to the already swollen [[Coldwater River|Coldwater]] and [[Blackwater River (Florida)|Blackwater]] rivers in [[Santa Rosa County, Florida|Santa Rosa County]]. Near the river, 30&nbsp;homes were destroyed with an additional 50&nbsp;houses damaged, totaling about $320,000 (1988&nbsp;USD, $545,000 2006&nbsp;USD) in damage.<ref name="tcr3"/> Several roads were closed from the flooding, as well.<ref name="spt910">{{cite news|author=Alicia Caldwell|date=1988-09-10|title=County dries off for a while|publisher=Saint Petersburg Times|accessdate=2007-03-04}}</ref> The strong convective band associated with Florence extended across the Florida Panhandle, spawning nine tornadoes in [[Walton County, Florida|Walton County]] and one waterspout in [[Bay County, Florida|Bay County]].<ref name="tcr2"/> Damage from the tornadoes amounted to about $100,000 (1988&nbsp;USD, $170,000 2006&nbsp;USD).<ref name="tcr3"/>

The remnant circulation of Florence produced light to moderate rainfall across the [[Ohio Valley]] and central [[United States]]. Precipitation reached over 3&nbsp;inches (75&nbsp;mm) in extreme southeastern [[Missouri]], southern [[Illinois]], and central [[Ohio]], and extended as far northward as [[Michigan]].<ref name="rain"/>

Due to the minor damage, the name ''Florence'' was not [[List of retired Atlantic hurricanes|retired]]; it was re-used in [[1994 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Florence|1994]], [[2000 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Florence|2000]], and [[Hurricane Florence (2006)|2006]].
