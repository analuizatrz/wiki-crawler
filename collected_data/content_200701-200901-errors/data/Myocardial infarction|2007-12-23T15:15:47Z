Acute '''myocardial infarction''' ('''AMI''' or '''MI'''), more commonly known as a '''heart attack''', is a medical condition that occurs when the [[Blood flow|blood supply]] to a part of the [[heart]] is interrupted, most commonly due to rupture of a [[vulnerable plaque]]. The resulting [[ischemia]] or [[Hypoxia (medical)|oxygen shortage]] causes damage and potential death of heart tissue. It is a [[medical emergency]], and the leading cause of death for both men and women all over the world.<ref name="WHO-2002">{{cite book | authorlink=http://www.who.int/en/ | title=The World Health Report 2004 - Changing History | publisher=[[World Health Organization]] | date=2004 | pages=120-4 | format=[[PDF]] | url=http://www.who.int/entity/whr/2004/en/report04_en.pdf | id= ISBN 92-4-156265-X}}</ref>  Important [[risk factor]]s are a previous history of vascular disease such as [[atherosclerosis|atherosclerotic]] [[coronary heart disease]] and/or [[Angina pectoris|angina]], a previous heart attack or [[stroke]], any previous episodes of abnormal heart rhythms or [[Fainting|syncope]], older age&mdash;especially men over 40 and women over 50, [[tobacco smoking|smoking]], excessive alcohol consumption, the abuse of certain drugs, high triglyceride levels, high [[Low density lipoprotein|LDL]] ("Low-density lipoprotein") and low [[High density lipoprotein|HDL]] ("High density lipoprotein"), [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]],  [[obesity]], and chronically high levels of stress in certain persons.

The term ''myocardial infarction'' is derived from ''[[myocardium]]'' (the heart muscle) and ''[[infarction]]'' (tissue death due to oxygen starvation). The phrase "heart attack" is sometimes used incorrectly to describe [[sudden cardiac death]], which may or may not be the result of acute myocardial infarction.

Classical symptoms of acute myocardial infarction include [[chest pain]] (typically radiating to the left arm), [[dyspnea|shortness of breath]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[palpitation]]s, [[sweating]], and [[anxiety]]. Patients frequently feel suddenly ill. Women often experience different symptoms from men. The most common symptoms of MI in women include shortness of breath, weakness, and [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]]. Approximately one third of all myocardial infarctions are silent, without chest pain or other symptoms.

Immediate treatment for suspected acute myocardial infarction includes [[oxygen therapy|oxygen]], [[aspirin]], [[Glyceryl trinitrate (pharmacology)|glyceryl trinitrate]] and [[analgesia|pain relief]], usually [[morphine sulfate]]. The patient will receive a number of diagnostic tests, such as an [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG, EKG), a chest [[X-ray]] and [[blood test]]s to detect elevated [[creatine kinase]] or [[troponin]] levels (these are chemical markers released by damaged tissues, especially the myocardium). Further treatment may include either [[medication]]s to [[thrombolysis|break down blood clots]] that block the blood flow to the heart, or mechanically restoring the flow by [[angioplasty|dilatation]] or [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|bypass surgery]] of the blocked coronary artery. [[Coronary care unit]] admission allows rapid and safe treatment of complications such as [[cardiac arrhythmia|abnormal heart rhythms]].

==Epidemiology==
Myocardial infarction is a common presentation of [[ischemic heart disease]]. The WHO estimated that in 2002, 12.6 percent of deaths worldwide were from ischemic heart disease.<ref name=WHO-2002/> Ischemic heart disease is the leading cause of death in developed countries, but third to [[AIDS]] and [[lower respiratory infection]]s in developing countries.<ref name="UCatlas">{{cite web | title=Cause of Death - UC Atlas of Global Inequality | publisher=Center for Global, International and Regional Studies (CGIRS) at the University of California Santa Cruz | url=http://ucatlas.ucsc.edu/cause.php | accessmonthday=December 7 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==<!-- This section is linked from [[Myocardial infarction]] -->

[[Image:Heart attack diagram.png|right|thumb|350px|A myocardial infarction occurs when an [[atherosclerosis|atherosclerotic]] [[Atheroma|plaque]] slowly builds up in the inner lining of a [[coronary artery]] and then suddenly ruptures, totally occluding the artery and preventing blood flow downstream.]]

{{main|Acute coronary syndrome}}

Acute myocardial infarction is a type of [[acute  coronary syndrome]], which is most frequently (but not always) a manifestation of [[coronary artery disease]]. The most common triggering event is the disruption of an [[Atherosclerosis|atherosclerotic]] [[Atheroma|plaque]] in an epicardial coronary artery, which leads to a clotting cascade, sometimes resulting in total occlusion of the artery. Atherosclerosis is the gradual buildup of [[cholesterol]] and fibrous tissue in plaques in the wall of [[artery|arteries]] (in this case, the [[coronary artery|coronary arteries]]), typically over decades. Blood stream column irregularities visible on angiographies reflect artery [[lumen]] narrowing as a result of decades of advancing atherosclerosis. Plaques can become unstable, rupture, and additionally promote a [[thrombus]] (blood clot) that occludes the artery; this can occur in minutes. When a severe enough plaque rupture occurs in the coronary vasculature, it leads to myocardial infarction (necrosis of downstream myocardium).

If impaired blood flow to the heart lasts long enough, it triggers a process called the [[ischemic cascade]]; the heart cells die (chiefly through  [[necrosis]]) and do not grow back. A [[collagen]] [[scar]] forms in its place. Recent studies indicate that another form of cell death called [[apoptosis]] also plays a role in the process of tissue damage subsequent to myocardial infarction.<ref name="Krijnen-2002">{{cite journal | author=Krijnen PA, Nijmeijer R, Meijer CJ, Visser CA, Hack CE, Niessen HW. | title=Apoptosis in myocardial ischaemia and infarction. | journal=J Clin Pathol | year=2002 | volume=55 | issue=11 | pages=801-11 | id=PMID 12401816}}</ref>  As a result, the patient's heart can be permanently damaged. This scar tissue also puts the patient at risk for potentially life threatening arrhythmias.

Injured heart tissue conducts electrical impulses more slowly than normal heart tissue. The difference in conduction velocity between injured and uninjured tissue can trigger [[Cardiac arrhythmia#Re-entry|re-entry]] or a feedback loop that is believed to be the cause of many lethal arrhythmias. The most serious of these arrhythmias is [[ventricular fibrillation]] (''V-Fib''/VF), an extremely fast and chaotic heart rhythm that is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death. Another life threatening arrhythmia is [[ventricular tachycardia]] (''V-Tach''/VT), which may or may not cause sudden cardiac death. However, ventricular tachycardia usually results in rapid heart rates that prevent the heart from pumping blood effectively. [[Cardiac output]] and [[blood pressure]] may fall to dangerous levels, which is particularly bad for the patient experiencing acute myocardial infarction.

The [[defibrillator|cardiac defibrillator]] is a device that was specifically designed to terminate these potentially fatal arrhythmias. The device works by delivering an electrical shock to the patient in order to depolarize a critical mass of the heart muscle, in effect "[[reboot]]ing" the heart. This therapy is time dependent, and the odds of successful defibrillation decline rapidly after the onset of cardiopulmonary arrest.

==Triggers==
Heart attack rates are higher in association with intense exertion, be it [[stress (psychology)|psychological stress]] or physical exertion, especially if the exertion is more intense than the individual usually performs.<ref name="Framingham1998">Wilson PW, D'Agostino RB, Levy D, Belanger AM, Silbershatz H, Kannel WB.

PMID 9603539</ref> One observed mechanism for this phenomenon is the increased arterial pulse pressure stretching and relaxation of arteries with each heart beat which, as has been observed with [[intravascular ultrasound]], increases mechanical "shear stress" on [[atheroma]]s and the likelihood of plaque rupture.<ref name="Framingham1998">Wilson PW, D'Agostino RB, Levy D, Belanger AM, Silbershatz H, Kannel WB.

Acute severe infection, such as [[pneumonia]], can trigger myocardial infarction.

Acute myocardial infarction is a type of [[acute coronary syndrome]], which is most frequently (but not always) a manifestation of [[coronary artery disease]]. The acute coronary syndromes include ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and [[unstable angina]] (UA).

Depending on the location of the obstruction in the [[coronary circulation]], different zones of the heart can become injured. Using the [[anatomical terms of location]], one can describe anterior, inferior, lateral, apical and septal infarctions (and combinations, such as anteroinferior, anterolateral, and so on).<ref name="MedicalDictionary">{{cite web | title=Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary | publisher=WB Saunders, an Elsevier imprint | url=http://www.mercksource.com/pp/us/cns/cns_hl_dorlands.jspzQzpgzEzzSzppdocszSzuszSzcommonzSzdorlandszSzdorlandzSzdmd_i_07zPzhtm | accessmonthday=November 25 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>  For example, an occlusion of the [[left anterior descending coronary artery]] will result in an anterior wall myocardial infarct.<ref name=rubin525>{{cite book | coauthors = Emanuel Rubin, Fred Gorstein, Raphael Rubin, Roland Schwarting, David Strayer | title = Rubin's Pathology - Clinicopathological Foundations of Medicine | publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | date = 2001 | location = Maryland | pages = 525 | id = ISBN 0-7817-4733-3 }}</ref>

The phrases transmural and subendocardial infarction used to be considered synonymous with Q-wave and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction respectively, based on the presence or absence of Q waves on the ECG.

[[Image:AMI pain back.png|right|thumb|150px|Back view.]]

The onset of symptoms in myocardial infarction (MI) is usually gradual, over several minutes, and rarely instantaneous.<ref name=warningsigns>[[National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute]]. [http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/actintime/haws/haws.htm Heart Attack Warning Signs]. Retrieved November 22, 2006.</ref> [[Chest pain]] is the most common symptom of acute myocardial infarction and is often described as a sensation of tightness, pressure, or squeezing. Chest pain due to [[ischemia]] (a lack of blood and hence oxygen supply) of the heart muscle is termed [[angina pectoris]]. Pain radiates most often to the left [[arm]], but may also radiate to the lower [[jaw]], [[neck]], right arm, [[Human back|back]], and [[epigastrium]], where it may mimic [[heartburn]]. Any group of symptoms compatible with a sudden interruption of the blood flow to the heart are called an [[acute coronary syndrome]].<ref name=ACS>[http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=3010002 Acute Coronary Syndrome]. [[American Heart Association]]. Retrieved November 25, 2006.</ref> Other conditions such as [[aortic dissection]] or [[pulmonary embolism]] may present with chest pain and must be considered in the [[differential diagnosis]].

Shortness of breath ([[dyspnea]]) occurs when the damage to the heart limits the [[Cardiac output|output]] of the [[left ventricle]], causing [[left ventricular failure]] and consequent [[pulmonary edema]].  Other symptoms include [[diaphoresis]] (an excessive form of [[sweating]]), weakness, [[light-headedness]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], and [[palpitation]]s. [[Unconsciousness|Loss of consciousness]] and even [[sudden cardiac death|sudden death]] can occur in myocardial infarctions.

Women often experience markedly different symptoms than men. The most common symptoms of MI in women include dyspnea, weakness, and [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]]. Fatigue, sleep disturbances, and [[dyspnea]] have been reported as frequently occurring symptoms which may manifest as long as one month before the actual clinically manifested ischemic event. In women, [[chest pain]] may be less predictive of coronary [[ischemia]] than in men.<ref name=McSweeney>{{cite journal | author=McSweeney JC, Cody M, O'Sullivan P, Elberson K, Moser DK, Garvin BJ | title=Women's early warning symptoms of acute myocardial infarction | journal=Circulation | year=2003 | pages=2619-23 | volume=108 | issue=21 | id=PMID 14597589}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of myocardial infarction is made by integrating the history of the presenting illness and physical examination with [[electrocardiogram]] findings and [[cardiac marker]]s ([[blood test]]s for [[Cardiac muscle|heart muscle]] [[cell (biology)|cell]] damage).<ref name=GPnotebook_MI>[http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/simplepage.cfm?ID=892665874&linkID=23278&cook=yes Myocardial infarction: diagnosis and investigations] - [[GPnotebook]], retrieved November 27, 2006.</ref> A [[Coronary catheterization|coronary angiogram]] allows to visualize narrowings or obstructions on the heart vessels, and therapeutic measures can follow immediately.

A [[chest radiograph]] and routine blood tests may indicate complications or precipitating causes and are often performed on admittance to an [[emergency department]]. New regional wall motion abnormalities on an [[Medical ultrasonography|echocardiogram]] are also suggestive of a myocardial infarction and are sometimes performed in equivocal cases.<ref name=eMedicineEMERG>''DE Fenton et al.''

===Diagnostic criteria===
WHO criteria<ref name=Gillum>Gillum RF, Fortmann SP, Prineas RJ, Kottke TE. International diagnostic criteria for acute myocardial infarction and acute stroke. ''Am Heart J'' 1984;108:150-8. PMID 6731265</ref> have classically been used to diagnose MI; a patient is diagnosed with myocardial infarction if two (probable) or three (definite) of the following criteria are satisfied:
# Clinical history of ischaemic type chest pain lasting for more than 20 minutes
# Changes in serial ECG tracings
# Rise and fall of serum cardiac biomarkers such as [[creatine kinase]], [[troponin]] I, and [[lactate dehydrogenase]] [[isozyme]]s specific for the heart.

The WHO criteria were refined in 2000 to give more prominence to cardiac biomarkers.<ref name="Alpert-2000"/> According to the new guidelines, a cardiac [[troponin]] rise accompanied by either typical symptoms, pathological Q waves, ST elevation or depression or coronary intervention are diagnostic of MI.

===Physical examination===
The general appearance of patients may vary according to the experienced symptoms; the patient may be comfortable, or restless and in severe distress with an increased [[respiratory rate]]. A cool and [[pallor|pale skin]] is common and points to [[vasoconstriction]]. Some patients have low-grade fever (38–39 °C). [[Blood pressure]] may be elevated or decreased, and the [[pulse]] can be become [[Cardiac arrhythmia|irregular]].<ref name=emedicine>S. Garas ''et al.''.

===Electrocardiogram===
{{main|Electrocardiogram}}
The primary purpose of the [[electrocardiogram]] is to detect [[ischemia]] or acute coronary injury in broad, symptomatic [[emergency department]] populations. However, the standard 12 lead [[electrocardiogram|ECG]] has several limitations. An [[electrocardiogram|ECG]] represents a brief sample in time. Because unstable ischemic syndromes have rapidly changing supply versus demand characteristics, a single [[electrocardiogram|ECG]] may not accurately represent the entire picture.<ref name=Cannon_175>Cannon CP at al. ''Management of Acute Coronary Syndromes''. p. 175. New Jersey: Humana Press, 1999. ISBN 0-89603-552-2.</ref> It is therefore desirable to obtain serial 12 lead [[ECG]]s, particularly if the first [[electrocardiogram|ECG]] is obtained during a pain-free episode. Alternatively, many [[emergency department]]s and [[chest pain center]]s use computers capable of continuous ST segment monitoring.<ref name="NHAAP_1997">Selker HP, Zalenski RJ, Antman EM, et al. "An evaluation of technologies for identifying acute cardiac ischemia in the emergency department: executive summary of a National Heart Attack Alert Program Working Group Report." ''Ann Emerg Med'' 1997; '''29'''(1): 25-28. PMID 8998085</ref> It should also be appreciated that the standard 12 lead [[electrocardiogram|ECG]] does not directly examine the [[right ventricle]], and does a relatively poor job of examining the posterior basal and lateral walls of the [[left ventricle]]. In particular, acute myocardial infarction in the distribution of the circumflex artery is likely to produce a nondiagnostic [[electrocardiogram|ECG]].<ref name=Cannon_175/> The use of non-standard [[electrocardiogram|ECG]] leads like right-sided lead V4R and posterior leads V7, V8, and V9 may improve sensitivity for right ventricular and posterior myocardial infarction. In spite of these limitations, the 12 lead [[electrocardiogram|ECG]] stands at the center of risk stratification for the patient with suspected acute myocardial infarction. Mistakes in interpretation are relatively common, and the failure to identify high risk features has a negative effect on the quality of patient care.<ref name="EDQMI_2006">Masoudi FA, Magid DJ, Vinson DR et al."Implications of the Failure to Identify High-Risk Electrocardiogram Findings for the Quality of Care of Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction." ''Circulation'' 2006; '''114''': 1565-1571.</ref>
The 12 lead ECG is used to classify patients into one of three groups:
:1. those with ST segment elevation or new bundle branch block (suspicious for acute injury and a possible candidate for acute reperfusion therapy with [[thrombolysis|thrombolytics]] or primary [[percutaneous coronary intervention|PCI]]), 
:2. those with ST segment depression or T wave inversion (suspicious for ischemia), and 
:3. those with a so-called non-diagnostic or normal ECG.<ref name="ECC_2005_ACS">"2005 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care - Part 8: Stabilization of the Patient With Acute Coronary Syndromes." ''Circulation'' 2005; '''112''': IV-89 - IV-110.</ref> 
A normal ECG does not rule out acute myocardial infarction. Sometimes the earliest presentation of acute myocardial infarction is the hyperacute T wave, which is treated the same as ST segment elevation.<ref name=Hyperacute2002>Somers MP, Brady WJ, Perron AD, Mattu A.

[[Left bundle branch block]] and [[artificial pacemaker|pacing]] can interfere with the electrocardiographic diagnosis of acute myocadial infarction. The GUSTO investigators Sgarbossa et al. developed a set of criteria for identifying acute myocardial infarction in the presence of left bundle branch block and paced rhythm. They include concordant ST segment elevation > 1 mm (0.1 mV), discordant ST segment elevation > 5 mm (0.5 mV), and concordant ST segment depression in the left precordial leads.<ref name="NEJM_Sgarbossa">Sgarbossa EB, Pinski SL, Barbagelata A, Underwood DA, Gates KB, Topol EJ, Califf RM, Wagner GS. "Electrocardiographic diagnosis of evolving acute myocardial infarction in the presence of left bundle branch block." ''N Engl J Med'' 1996; '''334''' (8): 481-7. PMID 8559200</ref> The presence of reciprocal changes on the 12 lead ECG may help distinguish true acute myocardial infarction from the mimics of acute myocardial infarction. The contour of the ST segment may also be helpful, with a straight or upwardly convex (non-concave) ST segment favoring the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction.<ref name="Contour_ST">"Electrocardiographic ST-segment elevation: the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction by morphologic analysis of the ST segment." ''Acad Emerg Med'' 2001; '''8(10)''': 961-7. PMID 11581081</ref>

The constellation of leads with ST segment elevation enables the clinician to identify what area of the heart is injured, which in turn helps predict the so-called culprit artery.

As the myocardial infarction evolves, there may be loss of R wave height and development of pathological Q waves. T wave inversion may persist for months or even permanently following acute myocardial infarction.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Morris F, Brady W | title = ABC of clinical electrocardiography: Acute myocardial infarction-Part I. | journal = BMJ | volume = 324 | issue = 7341 | pages = 831-4 | year = 2002 | id = PMID 1934778}}''[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1122768 Full text]''</ref> Typically, however, the T wave recovers, leaving a pathological Q wave as the only remaining evidence that an acute myocardial infarction has occurred.

===Cardiac markers===
{{main|Cardiac marker}}

Cardiac markers or cardiac enzymes are proteins from cardiac tissue found in the blood. These proteins are released into the bloodstream when damage to the heart occurs, as in the case of a myocardial infarction. Until the 1980s, the enzymes [[Aspartate transaminase|SGOT]] and [[lactate dehydrogenase|LDH]] were used to assess cardiac injury. Then it was found that disproportional elevation of the ''MB'' subtype of the enzyme [[creatine kinase]] (CK) was very specific for myocardial injury. Current guidelines are generally in favor of [[troponin]] sub-units I or T, which are very specific for the heart muscle and are thought to rise before permanent injury develops.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Eisenman A | title = Troponin assays for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction and acute coronary syndrome: where do we stand? | journal = Expert Rev Cardiovasc Ther | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = 509-14 | year = 2006 | id = PMID 16918269}}</ref> Elevated troponins in the setting of chest pain may accurately predict a high likelihood of a myocardial infarction in the near future.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Aviles RJ, Askari AT, Lindahl B, Wallentin L, Jia G, Ohman EM, Mahaffey KW, Newby LK, Califf RM, Simoons ML, Topol EJ, Berger P, Lauer MS | title = [[Troponin]] T levels in patients with acute coronary syndromes, with or without renal dysfunction. | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 346 | issue = 26 | pages = 2047-52 | year = 2002 | id = PMID 12087140}}. [http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/167/6/671 Summary for laymen]</ref>

The diagnosis of myocardial infarction requires two out of three components (history, ECG, and enzymes).  When damage to the heart occurs, levels of cardiac markers rise over time, which is why [[blood test]]s for them are taken over a 24 hour period. Because these enzyme levels are not elevated immediately following a heart attack, patients presenting with chest pain are generally treated with the assumption that a myocardial infarction has occurred and then evaluated for a more precise diagnosis.<ref name="Braunwald-2002">{{cite journal | author=Braunwald E, Antman EM, Beasley JW, Califf RM, Cheitlin MD, Hochman JS, Jones RH, Kereiakes D, Kupersmith J, Levin TN, Pepine CJ, Schaeffer JW, Smith EE III, Steward DE, Théroux P. | title=ACC/AHA 2002 guideline update for the management of patients with unstable angina and non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines (Committee on the Management of Patients With Unstable Angina). | journal=J Am Coll Cardiol | year=2002 | volume=40 | pages=1366-74 | id=PMID 12383588 | format=[[PDF]] | url=http://www.acc.org/qualityandscience/clinical/guidelines/unstable/incorporated/UA_incorporated.pdf}}</ref>

===Angiography===
[[Image:Ha1.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Angiogram]] of the coronary arteries.]]
{{main|Coronary catheterization}}

In difficult cases or in situations where intervention to restore blood flow is appropriate, coronary [[angiography]] can be performed. A [[catheter]] is inserted into an artery (usually the [[femoral artery]]) and pushed to the vessels supplying the heart. Obstructed or narrowed arteries can be identified, and [[angioplasty]] applied as a therapeutic measure (see below). Angioplasty requires extensive skill, especially in emergency settings, and may not always be available out of hours. It is commonly performed by [[interventional cardiology|interventional cardiologists]].

===Histopathology===
[[Image:Myocardial infarct emmolition phase histopathology.jpg|thumb|300px|Microscopy image (magn. ca 100x, [[H&E stain]]) from autopsy specimen of myocardial infarct (7 days post-infarction).]]
[[Anatomical pathology|Histopathological]] examination of the heart may reveal infarction at autopsy. Under the microscope, myocardial infarction presents as a circumscribed area of ischemic, coagulative [[necrosis]] (cell death). On gross examination, the infarct is not identifiable within the first 12 hours.<ref name=rubin546>{{cite book | coauthors = Emanuel Rubin, Fred Gorstein, Raphael Rubin, Roland Schwarting, David Strayer | title = Rubin's Pathology - Clinicopathological Foundations of Medicine | publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | date = 2001 | location = Maryland | pages = p. 546 | id = ISBN 0-7817-4733-3 }}</ref>

Although earlier changes can be discerned using [[electron microscopy]], one of the earliest changes under a normal microscope are so-called ''wavy fibers''.<ref name=Eichbaum1975>Eichbaum FW. "'Wavy' myocardial fibers in spontaneous and experimental adrenergic cardiopathies" ''Cardiology'' 1975; '''60'''(6): 358–65.

The interstitial space (the space between cells outside of blood vessels) may be infiltrated with [[red blood cell]]s.<ref name=rubin546/>

These features can be recognized in cases where the perfusion was not restored; reperfused infarcts can have other hallmarks, such as contraction band necrosis.<ref name="Fishbein-1990">{{cite journal | author=Fishbein MC. | title=Reperfusion injury. | journal=Clin Cardiol | year=1990 | volume=13 | issue=3 | pages=213-7 | id=PMID 2182247}}</ref>

Certain positions allow the patient to rest in a position which minimizes breathing difficulties. A half-sitting position with knees bent is often recommended. Access to more oxygen can be given by opening the window and widening the collar for easier breathing.

[[Glyceryl trinitrate (pharmacology)|Glyceryl trinitrate]] (nitroglycerin) [[sublingual]]ly (under the tongue) can be given if it has been prescribed for the patient.

If an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is available the rescuer should immediately bring the AED to the patient's side and be prepared to follow its instructions should the victim lose consciousness. 

If possible the rescuer should obtain basic information from the victim, in case the patient is unable to answer questions once [[Emergency medical technician|emergency medical technicians]] arrive (if the patient becomes unconscious). The victim's name and any information regarding the nature of the victims pain will useful to health care providers. Also the exact time that these symptoms started, what the patient was doing at the onset of symptoms, and anything else that might give clues to the pathology of the chest pain. It is also very important to relay any actions that have been taken, such as the number or dose of aspirin or nitroglycerin given, to the EMS personnel.

Other general first aid principles include monitoring pulse, breathing, level of consciousness and, if possible, the blood pressure of the patient. In case of [[cardiac arrest]], [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) can be administered.

===Automatic external defibrillation (AED)===
Since the publication of data showing that the availability of [[automated external defibrillator]]s (AEDs) in public places may significantly increase chances of survival, many of these have been installed in public buildings, [[public transport]] facilities, and in non-ambulance emergency vehicles (e.g. [[police car]]s and [[Fire apparatus|fire engine]]s). AEDs analyze the heart's rhythm and determine whether the rhythm is amenable to [[defibrillation]] ("shockable"), as in   [[ventricular tachycardia]] and [[ventricular fibrillation]].

===Emergency services===
[[Emergency medical services|Emergency Medical Services]] (EMS) Systems vary considerably in their ability to evaluate and treat patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction. Some provide as little as first aid and early defibrillation. Others employ highly trained paramedics with sophisticated technology and advanced protocols.<ref name="ACC_AHA_STEMI">Antman et al.

With [[percutaneous coronary intervention|primary PCI]] emerging as the preferred therapy for ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, [[emergency medical services|EMS]] can play a key role in reducing [[door to balloon]] intervals (the time from presentation to a hospital [[emergency department|ER]] to the restoration of coronary artery blood flow) by performing a 12 lead [[ECG]] in the field and using this information to triage the patient to the most appropriate medical facility.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rokos IC, Larson DM, Henry TD, ''et al'' |title=Rationale for establishing regional ST-elevation myocardial infarction receiving center (SRC) networks |journal=Am.

===Wilderness first aid===
In [[wilderness first aid]], a possible heart attack justifies [[patient evacuation|evacuation]] by the fastest available means, including [[MEDEVAC]], even in the earliest or precursor stages. The patient will rapidly be incapable of further exertion and have to be carried out.

===Air travel===
Certified personnel traveling by commercial aircraft may be able to assist an MI patient by using the on-board [[first aid kit]], which may contain some cardiac drugs (such as [[glyceryl trinitrate]] spray, [[aspirin]], or [[opioid]] painkillers) and [[oxygen]]. Pilots may divert the flight to land at a nearby airport. [[Cardiac monitors]] are being introduced by some airlines, and they can be used by both on-board and ground-based physicians.<ref name=aircraft>Dowdall N. "'Is there a doctor on the aircraft?' Top 10 in-flight medical emergencies." ''BMJ'' 2000; '''321'''(7272):1336-7. PMID 11090520. {{PMC|1119071}}</ref>

== Treatment ==
A heart attack is a [[medical emergency]] which demands both immediate attention and activation of the [[emergency medical services]]. The ultimate goal of the management in the acute phase of the disease is to salvage as much myocardium as possible and prevent further complications. As time passes, the risk of damage to the heart muscle increases; hence the phrase that in myocardial infarction, "time is muscle," and time wasted is muscle lost.<ref name="TimeIsMuscle"/>

The treatments itself may have complications. If attempts to restore the blood flow are initiated after a critical period of only a few hours, the result is [[reperfusion injury]] instead of amelioration.<ref name=Faxon2005>Faxon DP. "Coronary interventions and their impact on post myocardial infarction survival." ''Clin Cardiol'' 2005; '''28'''(11 Suppl 1):I38-44. PMID 16450811</ref> Other treatment modalities may also cause complications; the use of antithrombotics for example carries an increased risk of [[bleeding]].

===First line===
[[oxygen first aid|Oxygen]], [[aspirin]], [[glyceryl trinitrate (pharmacology)|glyceryl trinitrate]] (nitroglycerin) and [[analgesia]] (usually [[morphine]], hence the popular [[mnemonic]] ''MONA'', ''morphine, oxygen, nitro, aspirin'') are administered as soon as possible. In many areas, first responders can be trained to administer these prior to arrival at the hospital. Morphine is the preferred pain relief drug due to its ability to dilate blood vessels, which aids in blood flow to the heart as well as its pain relief properties.

Of the first line agents, only aspirin has been proven to decrease [[death|mortality]].<ref name="Lancet1988-ISIS2">{{cite journal | author=ISIS-2 Collaborative group | title=Randomized trial of intravenous streptokinase, oral aspirin, both, or neither among 17,187 cases of suspected acute myocardial infarction: ISIS-2. | journal=Lancet | year=1988 | pages=349-60 | issue=2 | id=PMID 2899772}}</ref>

Once the diagnosis of myocardial infarction is confirmed, other pharmacologic agents are often given.  These include [[beta blocker]]s,<ref name="ISIS-1">{{cite journal | author=ISIS-1 Collaborative Group | title=Randomised trial of intravenous atenolol among 16 027 cases of suspected acute myocardial infarction: ISIS-1 | journal=Lancet | year=1986 | volume=2 | issue=8498 | pages=57-66 | id=PMID 2873379}}</ref><ref name="TIMI-2">{{cite journal | author=The TIMI Study Group | title=Comparison of invasive and conservative strategies after treatment with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator in acute myocardial infarction. | journal=N Engl J Med | year=1989 | volume=320 | issue=10 | pages=618-27 | id=PMID 2563896}}</ref> anticoagulation (typically with [[heparin]]),<ref name="Antman-2004"/> and possibly additional antiplatelet agents such as [[clopidogrel]].<ref name="Antman-2004"/>  These agents are typically not started until the patient is evaluated by an emergency room physician or under the direction of a cardiologist.  These agents can be used regardless of the reperfusion strategy that is to be employed.  While these agents can decrease mortality in the setting of an acute myocardial infarction, they can lead to complications and potentially death if used in the wrong setting.

===Reperfusion===
The concept of reperfusion has become so central to the modern treatment of acute myocardial infarction, that we are said to be in the reperfusion era.<ref name="Reperfusion_Era_30_Day_Mortality">Lee KL, Woodlief LH, Topol EJ, et al. "Predictors of 30-Day Mortality in the Era of Reperfusion for Acute Myocardial Infarction." ''Circulation'' 1995; '''91''': 1659-1668. PMID 7882472</ref><ref name="Reperfusion_Era_PAMI">Stone GW, Grines CL, Browne KF, et al. "Predictors of in-hospital and 6-month outcome after acute myocardial infarction in the reperfusion era: the Primary Angioplasty in Myocardial Infarction (PAMI) trail." ''J Am Coll Cardiol'' 1995; '''25''': 370-377. PMID 14645641</ref> Patients who present with suspected acute myocardial infarction and ST segment elevation (STEMI) or new bundle branch block on the 12 lead [[ECG]] are presumed to have an occlusive thrombosis in an epicardial coronary artery. They are therefore candidates for immediate reperfusion, either with [[thrombolysis|thrombolytic therapy]], [[percutaneous coronary intervention]] (PCI) or when these therapies are unsuccessful, [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|bypass surgery]]. 

Individuals without ST segment elevation are presumed to be experiencing either unstable angina (UA) or non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). They receive many of the same initial therapies and are often stabilized with [[antiplatelet drug]]s and [[Anticoagulant|anticoagulated]]. If their condition remains ([[Hemodynamics|hemodynamically]]) stable, they can be offered either late [[Coronary catheterization|coronary angiography]] with subsequent restoration of blood flow (revascularization), or [[Minimally invasive procedure|non-invasive]] [[Cardiac stress test|stress testing]] to determine if there is significant ischemia that would benefit from revascularization.  If hemodynamic instability develops in individuals with NSTEMIs, they may undergo urgent coronary angiography and subsequent revascularization. The use of thrombolytic agents is contraindicated in this patient subset, however.<ref name="FTT_Lancet">"Indications for fibrinolytic therapy in suspected acute myocardial infarction: collaborative overview of early mortality and major morbidity results from all randomised trials of more than 1000 patients. Fibrinolytic Therapy Trialists' (FTT) Collaborative Group." ''Lancet'' 1994; '''343'''(8893): 311-22. PMID 7905143</ref>

The basis for this distinction in treatment regimens is that ST segment elevations on an ECG are typically due to complete occlusion of a coronary artery. On the other hand, in NSTEMIs there is typically a sudden narrowing of a coronary artery with preserved (but diminished) flow to the distal myocardium. Anticoagulation and antiplatelet agents are given to prevent the narrowed artery from occluding.

At least 10% of patients with STEMI don't develop myocardial necrosis (as evidenced by a rise in cardiac markers) and subsequent q waves on EKG after reperfusion therapy. Such a successful restoration of flow to the infarct-related artery during an acute myocardial infarction is known as "aborting" the myocardial infarction. If treated within the hour, about 25% of STEMIs can be aborted.<ref name=Verheught2006>Verheugt FW, Gersh BJ, Armstrong PW. "Aborted myocardial infarction: a new target for reperfusion therapy." ''Eur Heart J'' 2006; '''27'''(8): 901-4. PMID 16543251</ref>

====Thrombolytic therapy====
{{Main|Thrombolysis}}
Thrombolytic therapy is indicated for the treatment of STEMI if the drug can be administered within 12 hours of the onset of symptoms, the patient is eligible based on exclusion criteria, and primary PCI is not immediately available.<ref name="Antman-2004"/> The effectiveness of [[thrombolysis|thrombolytic therapy]] is highest in the first 2 hours. After 12 hours, the risk associated with thrombolytic therapy outweighs any benefit.<ref name="FTT_Lancet"/><ref name="Golden_Hour_Lancet">Boersma E, Maas AC, Deckers JW, Simoons ML.

PMID 8813982</ref> Because irreversible injury occurs within 2–4 hours of the infarction, there is a limited window of time available for reperfusion to work.

Although no perfect thrombolytic agent exists, an ideal thrombolytic drug would lead to rapid reperfusion, have a high sustained patency rate, be specific for recent thrombi, be easily and rapidly administered, create a low risk for intra-cerebral and systemic bleeding, have no antigenicity, adverse hemodynamic effects, or clinically significant drug interactions, and be cost effective.<ref name="Ideal_Thrombolytic">White HD, Van de Werf FJ. "Thrombolysis for acute myocardial infarction.." ''Circulation'' 1998; '''97''' (16): 1632-46. PMID 9593569</ref> Currently available thrombolytic agents include [[streptokinase]], [[urokinase]], and [[alteplase]] (recombinant [[tissue plasminogen activator]], rtPA).  More recently, thrombolytic agents similar in structure to rtPA such as [[reteplase]] and [[tenecteplase]] have been used. These newer agents boast efficacy at least as good as rtPA with significantly easier administration. The thrombolytic agent used in a particular individual is based on institution preference and the age of the patient.

Depending on the thrombolytic agent being used, [[adjuvant]] anticoagulation with [[heparin]] or [[low molecular weight heparin]] may be of benefit.<ref name="GUSTO-1993-1">{{cite journal | author=The GUSTO investigators | title=An international randomized trial comparing four thrombolytic strategies for acute myocardial infarction.

Intracranial bleeding (ICB) and subsequent [[cerebrovascular accident]] (CVA) is a serious side effect of thrombolytic use.  The risk of ICB is dependent on a number of factors, including a previous episode of intracranial bleed, age of the individual, and the thrombolytic regimen that is being used.  In general, the risk of ICB due to thrombolytic use for the treatment of an acute myocardial infarction is between 0.5 and 1 percent.<ref name="GUSTO-1993-1" />

Thrombolytic therapy to abort a myocardial infarction is not always effective.  The degree of effectiveness of a thrombolytic agent is dependent on the time since the myocardial infarction began, with the best results occurring if the thrombolytic agent is used within two hours of the onset of symptoms.<ref name="Boersma-1996">{{cite journal | author=Boersma E, Maas AC, Deckers JW, Simoons ML. | title=Early thrombolytic treatment in acute myocardial infarction: reappraisal of the golden hour. | journal=Lancet | year=1996 | volume=348 | issue=9030 | pages=771-5 | id=PMID 8813982}}</ref><ref name="Morrison-2000"/>  If the individual presents more than 12 hours after symptoms commenced, the risk of intracranial bleed are considered higher than the benefits of the thrombolytic agent.<ref name="LATE-1993">{{cite journal | author=LATE trial intestigatos. | title=Late Assessment of Thrombolytic Efficacy (LATE) study with alteplase 6-24 hours after onset of acute myocardial infarction. | journal=Lancet | year=1993 | volume=342 | issue=8874 | pages=759-66 | id=PMID 8103874}}</ref>  Failure rates of thrombolytics can be as high as 20% or higher.<ref name="Chesebro-1987">{{cite journal | author=Chesebro JH, Knatterud G, Roberts R, Borer J, Cohen LS, Dalen J, Dodge HT, Francis CK, Hillis D, Ludbrook P, et al. | title=Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) Trial, Phase I: A comparison between intravenous tissue plasminogen activator and intravenous streptokinase.

Percutaneous coronary intervention in this setting is known as "rescue PCI" or "salvage PCI". Complications, particularly bleeding, are significantly higher with rescue PCI than with primary PCI due to the action of the thrombolytic agent.

Primary PCI involves performing a coronary [[angiogram]] to determine the anatomical location of the infarcting vessel, followed by balloon [[angioplasty]] (and frequently deployment of an intracoronary stent) of the thrombosed arterial segment.  In some settings, an extraction catheter may be used to attempt to aspirate (remove) the thrombus prior to balloon angioplasty.  While the use of intracoronary [[stent]]s do not improve the short term outcomes in primary PCI, the use of stents is widespread because of the decreased rates of procedures to treat restenosis compared to balloon angioplasty.<ref name="Grines-1999">{{cite journal | author=Grines CL, Cox DA, Stone GW, Garcia E, Mattos LA, Giambartolomei A, Brodie BR, Madonna O, Eijgelshoven M, Lansky AJ, O'Neill WW, Morice MC. | title=Coronary angioplasty with or without stent implantation for acute myocardial infarction.

Despite the guidelines, emergency bypass surgery for the treatment of an acute myocardial infarction (MI) is less common then PCI or medical management. In an analysis of patients in the U.S. [[National Registry of Myocardial Infarction]] (NRMI) from January 1995 to May 2004, the percentage of patients with [[cardiogenic shock]] treated with primary PCI rose from 27.4% to 54.4%, while the increase in CABG treatment was only from 2.1% to 3.2%.<ref name=NRMI>Babaev A, Frederick PD, Pasta DJ, Every N, Sichrovsky T, Hochman JS; NRMI Investigators.

Coronary artery bypass surgery involves an artery or vein from the patient being implanted to bypass [[stenosis|narrowings]] or occlusions on the coronary arteries. Several arteries and veins can be used, however [[internal mammary artery]] grafts have demonstrated significantly better long-term patency rates than [[great saphenous vein]] grafts.<ref name=Raja2004>Raja SG, Haider Z, Ahmad M, Zaman H.

===Monitoring for arrhythmias===
Additional objectives are to prevent life-threatening arrhythmias or conduction disturbances. This requires monitoring in a [[coronary care unit]] and protocolised administration of [[antiarrhythmic agent]]s.  Antiarrhythmic agents are typically only given to individuals with life-threatening arrhythmias after a myocardial infarction and not to suppress the [[premature ventricular contraction|ventricular ectopy]] that is often seen after a myocardial infarction.<ref name="Echt-1991">{{cite journal | author=Echt DS, Liebson PR, Mitchell LB, Peters RW, Obias-Manno D, Barker AH, Arensberg D, Baker A, Friedman L, Greene HL, ''et al.'' | title= Mortality and morbidity in patients receiving encainide, flecainide, or placebo.

===Secondary prevention===
The risk of a recurrent myocardial infarction decreases with strict blood pressure management and lifestyle changes, chiefly [[smoking cessation]], regular [[Physical exercise|exercise]], a sensible [[Diet and heart disease|diet for patients with heart disease]], and [[Alcoholic beverages — recommended maximum intake|limitation of alcohol intake]].

Patients are usually commenced on several long-term medications post-MI, with the aim of preventing secondary cardiovascular events such as further myocardial infarctions, [[congestive heart failure]] or [[cerebrovascular accident]] (CVA). Unless contraindicated, such medications may include:<ref>Smith A, Aylward P, Campbell T, ''et al.'' Therapeutic Guidelines: Cardiovascular, 4th edition. North Melbourne: Therapeutic Guidelines; 2003. ISSN 1327-9513</ref><ref name=Rossi/>

* [[Antiplatelet drug]] therapy such as [[aspirin]] and/or [[clopidogrel]] should be continued to reduce the risk of plaque rupture and recurrent myocardial infarction. Aspirin is first-line, owing to its low cost and comparable efficacy, with clopidogrel reserved for patients intolerant of aspirin. The combination of clopidogrel and aspirin may further reduce risk of cardiovascular events, however the risk of [[hemorrhage]] is increased.<ref name="Peters-2003">{{cite journal | author=Peters RJ, Mehta SR, Fox KA, Zhao F, Lewis BS, Kopecky SL, Diaz R, Commerford PJ, Valentin V, Yusuf S; Clopidogrel in Unstable angina to prevent Recurrent Events (CURE) Trial Investigators. | title=Effects of aspirin dose when used alone or in combination with clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndromes: observations from the Clopidogrel in Unstable angina to prevent Recurrent Events (CURE) study. | journal=Circulation | year=2003 | volume= 108 | issue=14 | pages=1682-7 | id=PMID 14504182}}</ref>

* [[ACE inhibitor]] therapy should be commenced 24–48 hours post-MI in hemodynamically-stable patients, particularly in patients with a history of MI, [[diabetes mellitus]], [[hypertension]], [[anterior]] location of infarct (as assessed by ECG), and/or evidence of left ventricular dysfunction.

===New therapies under investigation===
Patients who receive [[Stem cell treatments|stem cell treatment]] by [[coronary artery]] injections of [[Adult stem cell|stem cells]] derived from their own [[bone marrow]] after a myocardial infarction (MI) show improvements in left ventricular [[ejection fraction]] and [[end-diastolic volume]] not seen with [[placebo]]. The larger the initial infarct size, the greater the effect of the infusion.  [[Clinical trial]]s of [[progenitor cell]] infusion as a treatment approach to ST elevation MI are proceeding.<ref name=REPAIR2006>{{cite journal | author = Schachinger V, Erbs S, Elsasser A, Haberbosch W, Hambrecht R, Holschermann H, Yu J, Corti R, Mathey DG, Hamm CW, Suselbeck T, Assmus B, Tonn T, Dimmeler S, Zeiher AM; REPAIR-AMI Investigators | title = Intracoronary bone marrow-derived progenitor cells in acute myocardial infarction | year = 2006 | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 355 | issue = 12 | pages = 1210-21 | id = PMID 16990384}}</ref>

There are currently 3 [[biomaterial]] and [[tissue engineering]] approaches for the treatment of MI, but these are in an even earlier stage of [[medical research]], so many questions and issues need to be addressed before they can be applied to patients. The first involves [[polymer]]ic left ventricular restraints in the prevention of [[heart failure]]. The second utilizes ''[[in vitro]]'' engineered cardiac tissue, which is subsequently implanted ''[[in vivo]]''. The final approach entails injecting cells and/or a scaffold into the myocardium to create ''[[in situ]]'' engineered cardiac tissue.<ref name=biomaterials2006>Christman KL, Lee RJ. "Biomaterials for the Treatment of Myocardial Infarction". ''J Am Coll Cardiol'' 2006; '''48'''(5): 907-13. PMID 16949479</ref>

==Complications==
Complications may occur immediately following the heart attack (in the [[Acute (medical)|acute]] phase), or may need time to develop (a [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] problem). After an infarction, an obvious complication is a second infarction, which may occur in the domain of another atherosclerotic coronary artery, or in the same zone if there are any live cells left in the infarct.

===Congestive heart failure===
{{Main|Congestive heart failure}}
A myocardial infarction may compromise the function of the heart as a pump for the [[Circulatory system|circulation]], a state called [[heart failure]]. There are different types of heart failure; left- or right-sided (or bilateral) heart failure may occur depending on the affected part of the heart, and it is a low-output type of failure. If one of the heart valves is affected, this may cause dysfunction, such as [[mitral regurgitation]] in the case of left-sided MI. The incidence of heart failure is particularly high in patients with diabetes and requires special management strategies.<ref name="Canto-2000">{{cite journal | author=Canto JG, Shlipak MG, Rogers WJ, Malmgren JA, Frederick PD, Lambrew CT, Ornato JP, Barron HV, Kiefe CI. | title=Prevalence, clinical characteristics, and mortality among patients with myocardial infarction presenting without chest pain. | journal=JAMA | year=2000 | volume=283 | issue=24 | pages=3223-9 | id=PMID 10866870}}</ref>

===Myocardial rupture===
{{Main|Myocardial rupture}}
[[Myocardial rupture]] is most common three to five days after myocardial infarction, commonly of small degree, but may occur one day to three weeks later.  In the modern era of early revascularization and intensive pharmacotherapy as treatment for MI, the incidence of myocardial rupture is about 1% of all MIs.<ref name="Yip-2003">{{cite journal | author=Yip HK, Wu CJ, Chang HW, Wang CP, Cheng CI, Chua S, Chen MC. | title=Cardiac rupture complicating acute myocardial infarction in the direct percutaneous coronary intervention reperfusion era. | journal=Chest | year=2003 | volume=124 | issue=2 | pages=565-71 | format=[[PDF]] | url=http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/reprint/124/2/565.pdf | id=PMID 12907544}}</ref>  This may occur in the free walls of the [[ventricles]], the [[septum]] between them, the [[papillary muscles]], or less commonly the [[atria]]. Rupture occurs because of increased pressure against the weakened walls of the heart chambers due to heart muscle that cannot pump blood out effectively. The weakness may also lead to ventricular [[aneurysm]], a localized dilation or ballooning of the heart chamber.

Risk factors for myocardial rupture include completion of infarction (no revascularization performed), female sex, advanced age, and a lack of a previous history of myocardial infarction.<ref name="Yip-2003"/>  In addition, the risk of rupture is higher in individuals who are revascularized with a thrombolytic agent than with PCI.<ref name="Becker-1996">{{cite journal | author=Becker RC, Gore JM, Lambrew C, Weaver WD, Rubison RM, French WJ, Tiefenbrunn AJ, Bowlby LJ, Rogers WJ. | title=A composite view of cardiac rupture in the United States National Registry of Myocardial Infarction. | journal=J Am Coll Cardiol | year=1996 | volume=27 | issue=6 | pages=1321-6 | id=PMID 8626938}}</ref><ref name="Moreno-2002">{{cite journal | author=Moreno R, Lopez-Sendon J, Garcia E, Perez de Isla L, Lopez de Sa E, Ortega A, Moreno M, Rubio R, Soriano J, Abeytua M, Garcia-Fernandez MA. | title=Primary angioplasty reduces the risk of left ventricular free wall rupture compared with thrombolysis in patients with acute myocardial infarction. | journal=J Am Coll Cardiol | year=2002 | volume=39 | issue=4 | pages=598-603 | id=PMID 11849857}}</ref>  The shear stress between the infarcted segment and the surrounding normal myocardium (which may be hypercontractile in the post-infarction period) makes it a nidus for rupture.<ref name="Shin-1983">{{cite journal | author=Shin P, Sakurai M, Minamino T, Onishi S, Kitamura H. | title=Postinfarction cardiac rupture. A pathogenetic consideration in eight cases. | journal=Acta Pathol Jpn | year=1983 | volume=33 | issue=5 | pages=881-93 | id=PMID 6650169}}</ref>

Rupture is usually a catastrophic event that may result a life-threatening process known as [[cardiac tamponade]], in which blood accumulates within the [[pericardium]] or heart sac, and compresses the heart to the point where it cannot pump effectively. Rupture of the intraventricular septum (the muscle separating the left and right ventricles) causes a [[ventricular septal defect]] with [[Shunt (medical)|shunting]] of blood through the defect from the left side of the heart to the right side of the heart.  Rupture of the papillary muscle may also lead to acute [[mitral regurgitation]] and subsequent [[pulmonary edema]] and possibly even [[cardiogenic shock]].

===Life-threatening arrhythmia===
[[Image:Electrocardiogram of Ventricular Tachycardia.png|right|thumb|300px|A 12 lead [[electrocardiogram]] showing ventricular tachycardia.]]
Since the electrical characteristics of the infarcted tissue change (see [[Myocardial infarction#Pathophysiology|pathophysiology section]]), [[arrhythmias]] are a frequent complication.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}  The re-entry phenomenon may cause too fast heart rates ([[ventricular tachycardia]] and even [[ventricular fibrillation]]),{{Fact|date=April 2007}} and ischemia in the [[electrical conduction system of the heart]] may cause a [[Third degree heart block|complete heart block]] (when the impulse from the [[sinoatrial node]], the normal cardiac pacemaker, doesn't reach the heart chambers any more).{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

===Pericarditis===
{{Main|Pericarditis}}
As a reaction to the damage of the heart muscle, [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] cells are attracted. The inflammation may reach out and affect the heart sac. This is called [[pericarditis]]. In [[Dressler's syndrome]], this occurs several weeks after the initial event.

===Cardiogenic shock===
A complication that may occur in the acute setting soon after a myocardial infarction or in the weeks following it is [[cardiogenic shock]].  Cardiogenic shock is defined as a hemodynamic state in which the heart cannot produce enough of a [[cardiac output]] to supply an adequate amount of oxygenated blood to the  tissues of the body.

While the data on performing interventions on individuals with cardiogenic shock is sparse, trial data suggests a long-term mortality benefit in undergoing revascularization if the individual is less than 75 years old and if the onset of the acute myocardial infarction is less than 36 hours and the onset of cardiogenic shock is less than 18 hours.<ref name="Hochman-1999" />  If the patient with cardiogenic shock is not going to be revascularized, aggressive hemodynamic support is warranted, with insertion of an [[intra-aortic balloon pump]] if not contraindicated.<ref name="Hochman-1999" />  If diagnostic coronary angiography does not reveal a culprit blockage that is the cause of the cardiogenic shock, the prognosis is poor.<ref name="Hochman-1999" />

==Prognosis==
The prognosis for patients with myocardial infarction varies greatly, depending on the patient, the condition itself and the given treatment. Using simple [[variable]]s which are immediately available in the [[emergency room]], patients with a higher risk of adverse outcome can be identified. For example, one study found that 0.4% of patients with a low risk profile had died after 90 days, whereas the [[mortality rate]] in high risk patients was 21.1%.<ref name="PEPA">Lopez de Sa E, Lopez-Sendon J, Anguera I, Bethencourt A, Bosch X; Proyecto de Estudio del Pronostico de la Angina (PEPA) Investigators.

Although studies differ in the identified variables, some of the more [[Reproducibility|reproduced]] risk stratifiers include age, [[Hemodynamics|hemodynamic]] parameters (such as [[heart failure]], [[cardiac arrest]] on admission, [[Systole (medicine)|systolic]] [[blood pressure]], or [[Killip class]] of two or greater), ST-segment deviation, [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[Blood plasma|serum]] [[creatinine]] concentration, [[Peripheral artery occlusive disease|peripheral vascular disease]] and elevation of cardiac markers.<ref name="PEPA"/><ref name="GRACE">Fox KA, Dabbous OH, Goldberg RJ, Pieper KS, Eagle KA, Van de Werf F, Avezum A, Goodman SG, Flather MD, Anderson FA Jr, Granger CB.

==Legal implications==
At [[common law]], a myocardial infarction is generally a [[disease]], but may sometimes be an [[injury]]. This has implications for no-fault insurance schemes such as [[workers' compensation]]. A heart attack is generally not covered;<ref name=prairieview>[http://www.pvamu.edu/pages/2026.asp Workers' Compensation FAQ]. [[Prairie View A&M University]]. Retrieved November 22, 2006.</ref> however, it may be a [[Industrial injury|work-related injury]] if it results, for example, from unusual emotional stress or unusual exertion.<ref name=biia>[http://www.biia.wa.gov/significantdecisions/contents.htm SIGNIFICANT DECISIONS Subject Index]. Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals. Retrieved November 22, 2006.</ref>  Additionally, in some jurisdictions, heart attacks suffered by persons in particular occupations such as [[police officer]]s may be classified as line-of-duty injuries by statute or policy. In some countries or states, a person who has suffered from a myocardial infarction may be prevented from participating in activity that puts other people's lives at risk, for example driving a car, taxi or airplane.<ref name="NovaScotia-DrivingRegulations"/>
