The '''Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority''' ('''MARTA''') is the largest [[public transit|public]] [[rapid transit|rapid-transit]] system (in both size and ridership) in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]].  MARTA operates a network of [[bus]] routes linked to a [[heavy rail]] rapid transit system consiting of 48 miles (77 km) of track and 38 train stations.  As of 2005, the system has an average weekday ridership of 461,600 passengers.

MARTA is funded and operated by the city of [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]] and [[DeKalb County, Georgia|Dekalb County]].  As a result MARTA only serves the city of [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]] and [[Dekalb County, Georgia|DeKalb County]], with additional limited bus service to [[Cobb County, Georgia|Cobb County]].  

MARTA is the largest [[United States]] transit agency not to receive [[U.S. state|state]] operational funding.  The other three largest counties in the metro Atlanta area, Cobb, [[Gwinnett County, Georgia|Gwinnett]], and [[Clayton County, Georgia|Clayton]], have refused to join or fund MARTA and as a result all three have independent transit agencies which connect to MARTA.  The continued refusal of neighboring counties to participate and the lack of state funding for operation of MARTA has limited the ability for a truly regional transportation system to be formed in Atlanta.  Racial and socioeconomic politics continue to play a role in the operation and future expansion of MARTA.  

The MARTA acronym is pronounced as a single word, not as individual letters.


==History==
The agency was formed by an act of the Georgia General Assembly in [[1965]]. In the same year, four metropolitan area counties (Clayton, DeKalb, Fulton, and Gwinnett) and the city of Atlanta passed a referendum authorizing participation in the system, but the referendum failed in [[Cobb County]]. Although a [[1968]] referendum to fund MARTA failed, in [[1971]], [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton]] and [[Dekalb County, Georgia|DeKalb]] Counties successfully passed a 1% sales tax increase to pay for operations, while Clayton and Gwinnett counties overwhelmingly rejected the tax in referendum, fearing the introduction of crime and "undesirable elements".
<ref>Bullard, R. D. et al. (2000) ''Sprawl City: Race, Politics, and Planning in Atlanta'', Washington DC, Island Press, p57. ISBN 1-55963-790-0</ref>
In 1971, the agency agreed to purchase the existing, bus-only [[Atlanta Transit Company]] and on [[February 17]], [[1972]] the sale was completed for [[United States dollar|US$]] 12.9 million giving the agency control over all public transit.

===East Line construction===
Construction on the East Line began in 1975 and the first rail service began on [[June 30]], [[1979]] between the Georgia State and Avondale stations. In June of 1993, the Kensington and Indian Creek stations opened, which also marked the first time MARTA rail service went outside [[Interstate 285|I-285]].

===West Line construction===
The West Line opened between Hightower (now Hamilton E. Holmes) and Five Points stations, on [[December 22]], [[1979]]. On [[December 12]], [[1992]] the Proctor Creek Branch and Bankhead Station opened. The 1979 plan for the West Line also included an additional station at Fairburn Road (later shortened to Brownlee-Boulder Park) and another station was planned at the then-existing Perry Homes housing project on the Proctor Creek Line.

===North Line construction===
On [[December 4]], [[1981]], the North-South Line opened from Garnett to North Avenue, including Civic Center and the lower level of Five Points. On [[September 11]], [[1982]], the line was expanded to Arts Center, and the Peachtree Center Station (whose opening was delayed from 1981) also opened. The section between Lindbergh Center and Brookhaven opened on [[December 15]], [[1984]]. The line reached Chamblee in 1987, and the Doraville terminus was finished in 1992. The section between Lenox and Doraville was redesignated the Northeast Line on [[June 8]], [[1996]] when the North Line opened between Buckhead and Dunwoody stations, including a stretch in the [[Georgia 400]] median. The last two North Line stations to open were Sandy Springs and North Springs, on [[December 16]], [[2000]].

===South Line construction===
The Garnett station opened on [[December 4]], [[1981]] and was the first South Line station to open. The section between the West End and Lakewood-Fort McPherson opened on [[December 15]], [[1984]]. The East Point Station opened on [[August 16]], [[1986]]. and the College Park and Airport Stations opened on [[June 18]], [[1988]]. The Airport Station however, was built in 1980 as part of the construction of Hartsfield International Airport and was unused until the line was connected.

==MARTA system==
[[Image:MARTA Rail Map.svg|300px|right|Map of the MARTA rail system]]
MARTA is comprised of both heavy rail transit and bus transit that operate within the boundaries of Fulton and DeKalb counties. A recent notable exception is that effective November 20, 2006, MARTA is offering bus service to Cobb County's Cumberland Boulevard Transfer Center on one bus route <ref>[http://www.itsmarta.com/newsroom/press_releases/rel.asp?id=179 November 20, 2006 MARTA Press Release]</ref>. For fiscal year 2005, the average weekday ridership was 461,600. Overall for the year, bus and paratransit ridership was 71,401,846 while rail ridership was 70,984,053.

As of 2005 MARTA had 4,300 employees including 1,085 full time bus drivers and 184 full time rail operators. <ref>[http://itsmarta.com/about/MARTOC/index.htm 2005 MARTOC report]</ref> Rail and bus operators, station agents, rail maintenance technicians and many other front line support personnel are represented by [[Amalgamated Transit Union]] Local 732.

===Heavy rail network===
{{main|List of MARTA stations}}
[[Image:Marta station sign.jpg|thumb|left|Marta rail station sign]]
MARTA rail is comprised of two service lines, the North-South line (orange) and the East-West line (blue). The lines connect at the [[Five Points (MARTA station)|Five Points station]].
Trains are operated using [[Automatic Train Control]], with one MARTA train operator to make announcements and operate the doors.

The North-South Corridor splits north of the Lindbergh Center Station (stop N6). Northbound trains are identified by their destinations (North Springs or Doraville) on electronic LCD signs on the front of the train and on each car. Train drivers also announce train destinations at each stop. During daytime hours, trains from both lines service the entire trunk line (N6 to S7); all southbound trains are identified with a destination of Airport. After 9pm weekdays (8 pm weekends and holidays) only Doraville bound trains service N6 to S7. As a result, riders must transfer to or from a North Springs train at Lindbergh Center (N6).

The East-West Corridor splits at Ashby Station (stop W3). Trains are identfied by their final destination. Trains from H.E. Holmes (W5) travel to Indian Creek Station (E9). Normally, trains originating at Bankhead Station (stop P4) can only go so far as King Memorial Station (stop E2). During rush hours (6-9am and 3-7pm) on weekdays, this is extended to Edgewood/Candler Park Station (stop E4). During weekends and after 8pm every day, trains originating at Bankhead Station only go so far as Vine City Station (stop W2).

Previous maps of the MARTA system use orange to label the North-South line and blue to label the East-West line. Newer maps currently appear on trains, at stations, and on the system's website to further differentiate the different branches of the North-South and East-West Corridors with different colors (North Springs/Airport-red, Doraville/Airport-orange, H.E. Holmes-Indian Creek-blue, Proctor Creek/Edgewood-green).

Many suburban stations offer designated free daily and paid long term parking. These stations also have designated kiss ride passenger drop off parking spaces closest to the station entrance.

====Rolling stock====

MARTA has entered a contract with Alstom to rebuild all CQ310 and CQ311 cars. (238 Rail Cars) The rehabilitated cars will feature upgraded passenger amenities and upgraded propulsion and train control hardware. The first rehabilitated cars began service [[March 12]], [[2006]]. The refurbishing program will last until 2008-2009.

===Bus===
[[Image:Decatur 023.jpg|thumb|right|MARTA bus]]
[[Image:Marta bus stop.jpg|thumb|right|MARTA bus stop sign]]
MARTA's bus system serves a wider area than the rail system, serving areas in Fulton and DeKalb counties such as the cities of [[Roswell, Georgia|Roswell]] and [[Alpharetta]] in North Fulton, along with South DeKalb. Effective November 20, 2006 MARTA now has one bus route providing limited service in Cobb County (Route 12 has been extended to Cobb County's Cumberland Boulevard Transfer Center).<ref>[http://www.itsmarta.com/newsroom/press_releases/rel.asp?id=179 November 20, 2006 MARTA Press Release]</ref> <ref> [http://www.itsmarta.com/getthere/schedules/12.htm Howell Mill Bus Route]</ref> All of the MARTA bus lines feed into or intersect MARTA rail lines as well. MARTA also runs shuttles for special events, such as the [[Peachtree Road Race]] and [[Atlanta Braves]] [[baseball]] games. MARTA shuttle service is also available to [[Six Flags Over Georgia]] during the park's summer season.

In addition to the free parking adjacent to many rail stations, MARTA also operates [[Park and ride]] lots serviced only by bus routes:
* Windward Parkway
* Mansell Road
* Stone Mountain
* Barge Road
* South Fulton

For some time, MARTA had "secret" bus routes in the 700 series. These routes were designed to connect maids, home health care workers, and nannies from MARTA rail stations to their work sites. These routes were not officially noted in any system map except for a small footprint instructing people who needed transit service in that area to contact Customer Information. <ref>[http://groups.google.com/group/misc.transport.urban-transit/msg/2fdb62168f741ba0 MTUT story]</ref> No schedules were publicly distributed, and no information was published on the web site. In 1999, the routes were officially "declassified" and information was published. As part of system-wide service cuts, the 700 series routes were eliminated in 2002. <ref>[http://itsmarta.com/about/history05.htm MARTA announces route cuts]</ref>

===Paratransit service===
In compliance with the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans with Disabilities Act]], MARTA provides both curb to curb service and feeder service for those persons defined as disabled by the ADA. MARTA uses special lift equipped vehicles for this service and can either deliver passengers to their final destination (curb to curb service) or can deliver the passenger to the closest accessible bus stop or rail station (feeder service).

The average cost to MARTA for providing a one way trip for an individual paratransit passenger is $31.88.<ref>[http://www.gcdd.org/home/Plan/The%20GCDD%205%20Year%20Strategic%20Plan.rtf Georgia Governor's Council on Developmental Disabilities Five Year Strategic Plan]</ref> This is much greater than the $3.50 fare the paratransit rider is required to pay. The Americans with Disabilities Act forbids MARTA from changing a paratransit fare more than twice the normal fixed route fare.

Paratransit is limited to existing rail and bus routes and cannot extend more than a 0.75 mile radius from any existing route. Paratransit service is only provided during the hours of the fixed route servicing the area. An application for acceptance into the paratransit service is required; reservations are required for all users for each trip.

==Fare structure and operation==
===Summary of fares===
MARTA offers both single one-way fares (with free bus to rail and rail to bus transfers) and discounted weekly and monthly passes.
The fare structure is as follows<ref> [http://www.itsmarta.com/howto/fares.htm MARTA Fares] </ref>:
* Single one-way fare: [[United States dollar|US$]]1.75
* Single one-way paratransit fare: [[United States dollar|US$]]3.50
* Weekly pass (Monday-Sunday): [[United States dollar|US$]]13
* Monthly pass (one calendar month): [[United States dollar|US$]]52.50
* Weekend pass (Friday-Sunday): [[United States dollar|US$]]9

Discounted programs available to select users:
* University monthly pass (UPASS) program: [[United States dollar|US$]]40 (Students) [[United States dollar|US$]]49.50 (Faculty/Staff)
* Student weekly pass program: [[United States dollar|US$]]10 (K-12 students in DeKalb and Fulton Counties)
* Half-fare program: [[United States dollar|US$]]0.85 one-way (Passengers over 65 and [[Medicare (United States)|MediCare]] recipients)

Special routes, such as the [[Atlanta Braves]] shuttle and the [[Hi-Fi Buys Amphitheater]] have an additional [[United States dollar|US$]]1 surcharge for each one-way trip.  Out of district routes ([[Six Flags Over Georgia]] shuttle service) have an additional [[United States dollar|US$]]0.75 surcharge.  '''MARTA has recently proposed ending the Atlanta Braves and Six Flags shuttle surcharges effective April 28, 2007 and is currently in the process of holding public hearings on the issue. <ref>[http://www.itsmarta.com/about/public_hearing_2_5_2007.pdf Marta public hearings on proposed bus service modifications for April 28, 2007]</ref>'''

Effective January 2006, disabled riders who are paratransit eligible can ride fixed bus and rail routes for free.

Additional discounts are available to corporate partners who sell monthly MARTA passes to employees and also to groups and conventions visiting Atlanta. Some employers (at their own expense) also provide reduced cost or free MARTA passes to employees to encourage the use of public transportation.

===Breeze Card===
[[Image:Happymartacards.JPG|thumb|right|Examples of MARTA Transcards (monthly and weekly), Limited Use Breeze Ticket, and Extended Use Breeze Card]]
{{main|Breeze Card}}
MARTA has finished implementing the "Breeze" fare collection system as of September 2006, allowing riders to load money on the card for use over time, and to add weekly/monthly passes that are not fixed to a calendar period. The system uses a two card scheme: the '''Limited-Use Ticket''' is used by people who are visiting and other light users, and is composed of coated paper around the RFID antenna. The '''Extended-Use Card''' is meant for those who use MARTA frequently and need to load time-based passes. Breeze is supposed to help prevent [[Turnstile jumping|fare evasion]] which costs MARTA an estimated [[United States dollar|US$]]10 million per year <ref> [http://www.ajc.com/search/content/auto/epaper/editions/today/metro_34cf1163a022126c00b8.html MARTA Plugs Gap in New Station Gates] </ref>. Other connecting transit systems such as [[Georgia Regional Transportation Authority|GRTA Xpress]], [[Cobb Community Transit|CCT]] have adopted the infrastructure, and are currently building implementation plans; and the future [[Belt Line]] is likely to as well.

MARTA has stopped selling tokens (as of fall 2006), but magnetic weekly and monthly MARTA cards continue to be sold (until spring 2007). As the system reaches its final phase, MARTA will host "token exchanges" from October to December, allowing people with rolls of tokens to have the number of tokens encoded on an extended-use card. Extended-Use cards became available for pre-registered users in September of 2006.

===Hours of operation===
MARTA operates 365 days a year. Rail service is provided from approximately 5 a.m. to 1 a.m. Monday through Friday and 5 a.m. to 12:30 a.m. on weekends and holidays, and during certain events (New Year's  Eve) trains run 24 hours.  Weekday train frequency is 10 minutes on branch lines and 5 minute frequencies on trunk lines. Late night (after 7:00 pm) and weekend frequency is reduced, with train frequencies of 15-20 minutes on all lines. Bus routes have varying frequencies depending on passenger demand.

===MARTA Police===
MARTA maintains its own police force, which is currently headed by Chief Wanda Dunham. MARTA has been named the safest transit system in the US seventeen times.<ref>[http://www.itsmarta.com/visitors/safety.htm MARTA Visitor Safety]</ref>

===Fare reciprocity===
MARTA riders are able to transfer for free to other metro area transit systems, including [[Gwinnett County Transit]], [[Cobb Community Transit]], [[Clayton County C-TRAN]], and [[Georgia Regional Transportation Authority|GRTA Xpress]]. These fare reciprocity agreements also allow for riders of the other four systems to transfer for free to MARTA. Some of these agreements require that neither system have significantly more transfers than the other. MARTA has stated that this is the case, that inbound (to MARTA from another system) and outbound (from MARTA to another system) transfers are approximately equal (for second quarter 2006 8,888 daily passengers transferred inbound and 8,843 transferred outbound).<ref>[http://www.itsmarta.com/board/minutes/Customer%20Development%203_20_2006.doc MARTA Customer Development Committee Minutes, March 20, 2006]</ref> However, it has been noted that workers traveling in the morning to Atlanta from another system will more than likely make the return trip home, resulting in the appearance of an equal number of transfers. Analysis of morning transfers (5 to 9 am) to MARTA shows that Cobb County had 718 inbound transfers but only 528 outbound, Clayton county had 928 inbound but only 424 outbound, Gwinnett County had 239 inbound and 269 outbound, and GRTA Xpress had 1,175 inbound but 615 outbound.).<ref>[http://www.itsmarta.com/board/minutes/Customer%20Development%203_20_2006.doc MARTA Customer Development Committee Minutes, March 20, 2006]</ref> These data suggest that more people from the other systems benefit from free transfers than those living in the MARTA service area.

==MARTA funding==
In addition to fare collections, the MARTA budget is funded by a 1% [[sales tax]] in Fulton and DeKalb counties along with limited federal money. MARTA has never received any operational funding from the State of Georgia, making it the largest public transportation agency in the United States not to receive state funding.<ref>[http://atlanta.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A63086 2006 Creative Loafing Article]</ref>

Some of Metro Atlanta's inner suburban counties, [[Gwinnett County, Georgia|Gwinnett]], and [[Clayton County, Georgia|Clayton]] initially agreed to join MARTA but refused membership when voters in their respective counties voted against paying to help fund the system. The inner suburban counties have instead created their own independent bus systems; [[Cobb Community Transit]] on [[July 10]], [[1989]], [[Gwinnett County Transit]] on [[November 5]], [[2001]] , and [[Clayton County C-TRAN]] on [[October 1]], [[2001]]. Buses traveling from Cobb, Clayton and Gwinett are able to drop riders off at MARTA stations in the city through fare reciprocity agreements. A separate regional bus transit service, Xpress, is operated by the [[Georgia Regional Transportation Authority]] in partnership with 11 metro Atlanta counties inluding Fulton and Dekalb, which began service on [[June 6]], [[2004]]. 

===Operations vs. capital expenditures===
By law, half of all MARTA revenues (sales tax plus fare box) must be spent on operations, half on capital expenditures like expanding the system. The idea behind the split is that at the time of MARTA's formation it should continue expanding and investing in the system. However, MARTA currently has no future plans to expand rail service. As a result the capital funds enjoy a large surplus whereas the operations funds limit the amount of service MARTA provides. This law was amended by the state legislature in 2002 to allow a temporary three year 45% capital/55% operations split <ref> [http://www.itsmarta.com/about/history05.htm Marta History]</ref>. This additional 5% for operations expired in 2005. A bill to renew the split was tabled by the legislature's MARTA Oversight Committee, forcing MARTA to pass a new budget with cuts in service. In addition a fare increase was considered; however, MARTA board members voted down a fare increase and instead used cash reserves to make up for the operations shortfall. The temporary 45/55 capital/operations split was renewed again in the 2006 state legislative session. The capital funds surplus has resulted in projects, such as a new $100+ million [[Breeze Card]] fare collection system and $1.1 million automatic toilets in the MARTA Five Points station, occurring at the same time that MARTA is struggling to pay for bus and rail operations. <ref> [http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/stories/0719metmarta.html AJC Automatic Toilet Story]</ref>

==MARTA Governance==
===General Manager/Chief Executive Officer===
The highest employee at MARTA is the General Manager/CEO. In September 2006, Richard McCrillis was named the new General Manager after having served since January 2006 as Interim General Manager. McCrillis was chosen after the other finalist for the job withdrew his application. McCrillis has worked at MARTA since 1985. <ref name="MARTA_PR_2006-09-25">{{cite web |url=http://www.itsmarta.com/newsroom/press_releases/rel.asp?id=168 | title=MARTA BOARD OF DIRECTORS NAMES MARTA GENERAL MANAGER | publisher=MARTA Press Center| author=MARTA | date=2006-09-25 | accessdate=2006-10-28 }}</ref> Prior to McCrillis, MARTA's General Manager was Nathaniel Ford from 2000 to 2006. In January 2006 Ford offered his resignation to take a position as the Director of Transportation of the [[San Francisco Municipal Railway]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfmuni.com/cms/msc/pr/geninfo.htm#nford | title=MUNI General Information | publisher=MUNI| author=MUNI | date=2006-10-24 | accessdate=2006-10-28 }}</ref>

===Board of Directors===
MARTA is governed by a Board of Directors consisting of the following members:
* Four members representing the City of Atlanta
** Juanita Jones Abernathy
** Clara H. Axam
** Gloria Leonard
** Michael Walls
* Five members representing DeKalb County
** Harold Buckley, Sr.
** J. Thomas Kilpatrick
** Mukesh "Mike" Patel
** Pat Upshaw-Monteith
** Edmund J. Wall
* Three members representing Fulton County
** Barbara Babbit Kaufman
** Walter L. Kimbrough, L.H.D.
** Marie R. Metze, Ph.D.
* One member representing Clayton County
** George E. Glaze
* One member representing Gwinnett County
** Bruce E. Le'Vell
* Four ex officio members from different State of Georgia committees:
** State Properties Commission & Georgia Building Authority - Gena Abraham
** Georgia Department of Revenue - Bart L. Graham
** [[Georgia Department of Transportation]] - Harold E. Linnenkohl
** [[Georgia Regional Transportation Authority]] - Steve Stancil
Positions on the MARTA Board of Directors are not elected; rather they are appointed by the organizations they represent. Although the state does not contribute to MARTA's operational fuding (see Criticism and Concern), it still has voting members on the MARTA board. A similar situation exists for both Clayton and Gwinnett counties; as a consequence of passing the authorization referendum but not the funding referendum, Clayton and Gwinnett Counties have representation on the MARTA Board of Directors without paying into the system. This situation became controversial in 2004 when Gwinnett's representative Mychal Walker was found to have accepted [[United States dollar|US$]]20,000 from a lobbyist trying to secure a [[United States dollar|US$]]100,000,000 contract with MARTA. Despite the controversy, the Gwinnett County Commission failed to remove Mr. Walker from his position on the MARTA Board.<ref>[http://www.ajc.com/tuesday/content/epaper/editions/tuesday/metro_14caf02d7626a0510088.html AJC MARTA board story]</ref> Eventually the state legislature was called upon to change the law governing MARTA's Board to allow for the removal of a member whose appointing county did not act on a request for removal. Before the new law could be used, Mr. Walker was arrested on an unrelated child support violation, which resulted in his firing by the Gwinnett County Commission.<ref>[http://template.ajc.com/wednesday/content/epaper/editions/wednesday/metro_24dd6e14b2e100da00e5.html AJC MARTA story]</ref>

===MARTA Oversight Committee===
The [[Georgia General Assembly]] has a standing [[MARTA Oversight Committee]], which is frequently abbreviated MARTOC. This committee is charged with financial oversight of the MARTA organization. State legislation concerning MARTA must pass through this committee. The current chairperson of the committee is Representative Jill Chambers.

* Memorial Bus Rapid Transit: Implementation of bus rapid transit from the former [[Avondale Mall]] to the MARTA Park and Ride Lot in [[Stone Mountain, Georgia|Stone Mountain]]. '''This project has moved to the environmental study stage, with an implementation timeline of 2008'''<ref>[http://itsmarta.com/newsroom/planstudy.htm]</ref>

Additional expansion plans for MARTA and other metro Atlanta transportation agencies are detailed in [[Mobility 2030 (Atlanta)|Mobility 2030]] a timeline by the [[Atlanta Regional Commission]] for improving transit through the year 2030.

==Criticism and concern==
===Financial Support===
Since the formation of MARTA, the Georgia state government has never contributed to MARTA operational funding, and currently MARTA is the largest mass transportation system in the United States not to receive state funding. <ref>[http://atlanta.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A63086 2006 Creative Loafing Article]</ref>  Revenue from the Georgia motor fuel tax is currently restricted to roads and bridges and cannot be used for public transportation, further complicating potential sources state funding of MARTA.<ref>Bullard, R. D. et al. (2000) ''Sprawl City: Race, Politics, and Planning in Atlanta'', Washington DC, Island Press, p52. ISBN 1-55963-790-0</ref>   In addition many other suburban counties, such as [[Gwinnett County]] and [[Cobb County]], have refused to join or fund MARTA (see history, above).  Due to its limited funing from Fulton and Dekalb Counties, MARTA has struggled to provide adequate service to the metropolitan area, and as a result, MARTA has gained a reputation for being ineffective and inconvenient. Many people who own cars avoid using the system, and residents in suburban areas usually must still drive to a MARTA station to ride a train.  MARTA's financial structure (being tied to a 1% sales tax) has forced the agency to cut services during times of economic depression, further resulting in complaints about the inconvenience and inadequacy of MARTA services.

Although surrounding counties do not pay for MARTA, many of their residents use MARTA by driving directly to a MARTA station or by using a county or regional bus system which connects to MARTA.  A license plate study from 1988 to 1997 showed that 44 percent of the cars parked in MARTA park-and-ride lots were from outside of Fulton and DeKalb counties.  Current fare reciprocity agreements also allow non-paying counties to provide bus service for their residents which provide free connections to MARTA (see fare reciprocity).  Sixteen percent of MARTA riders live outside of DeKalb and Fulton counties.<ref>Bullard, R. D. et al.

===Racial Concern===
Because of its location in the American Southeast, with its long history of troubled [[race relations]], it is often argued that racial politics also play a role in the operation and future service planning for MARTA. The acronym is sometimes referred to as "Moving Africans Rapidly Through Atlanta" due to the relatively low number of White riders, or Non-African riders in general, particularly after peak commuting hours.<ref>[http://www.ejrc.cau.edu/artajcmartaimageprob.htm AJC: MARTA Image Problem]</ref> A 1999 MARTA rider survey revealed that 78 percent of MARTA riders are African American.<ref>Bullard, R. D. et al. (2000) ''Sprawl City: Race, Politics, and Planning in Atlanta'', Washington DC, Island Press, p58. ISBN 1-55963-790-0</ref>  As mentioned before, Cobb and Gwinnett counties initially rejected MARTA at inception and to this day, some predominantly White suburban communities have opposed MARTA expansions, believing it will be a pipeline to bring unwelcome minorities and/or crime from the city of Atlanta into their communities.

Georgia transportation policies and race have been compared to a two-tiered transportation apartheid. Billions are spent by the state to aid commutes of mostly Caucasian residents of the suburbs, while service cuts at MARTA have hurt mostly African Americans.

===Reliability of Service===
As is typical of rail transit in the United States, MARTA's rail lines have two parallel tracks. Any train failure or track work results in shared use of the other track by trains going opposite direction, a situation known as single-tracking. There are no plans at this time to expand the number of tracks. MARTA is currently nearing the end of a complete replacement of tracks on all rail lines. Over the past few years, this replacement work has caused the agency to implement single tracking on the weekends, which in turn has caused weekend patrons to experience less frequent service.

In the Summer of 2006, as a result of high summertime temperatures, many MARTA rail cars became overheated, damaging onboard propulsion equipment. As a result many trains broke down and had to be taken out of service for repair. This was further compounded by the fact that at any given time up to 50 older rail cars are out of service as part of MARTA's rail car rehabilitation project. To compensate for fewer cars MARTA shortened trains from 6 cars to 4 cars in length. Sometimes this resulted in almost half of the trains being shortened, resulting in crowded conditions for passengers.<ref>[http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/dekalb/stories/2006/09/11/0912martacar.html AJC September 12 2006]</ref> The breakdowns and overcrowded conditions may have contributed to a drop in customer satisfaction in the most recent customer survey (72% were very satisfied or satisfied with MARTA, a 7% decline from the prior survey).<ref>[http://www.ajc.com/opinion/content/opinion/stories/2006/09/18/0919marta.html AJC September 18 2006]</ref>

===MARTA Governance===
The composition of the MARTA Board of Directors is also criticized. The State of Georgia, Gwinnett and Clayton Counties do not support MARTA financially, but still have positions on the MARTA Board of Directors. Additional criticisms of the MARTA Board is that they are not elected, and thus not accountable to the citizens whom they represent. Furthermore, the Board members are also criticized for not being regular users of MARTA and thus are not actually aware of the concerns of MARTA commuters.

As the metropolitan area grows the [[Georgia Department of Transportation]] has looked to greater road infrastructure to manage traffic problems. Most notably, a proposal for the widening of [[Interstate 75|I-75]] will put up to 23 lanes of traffic into the city. The city of [[Atlanta]], however, has started a push for new mass transportation systems, such as a proposed [[Belt Line]] and a streetcar line up [[Peachtree Street]]. The [[Georgia Department of Transportation]] even plans to build a commuter rail line from Lovejoy, Georgia to Atlanta, and there is considerable support for an Athens-Atlanta line dubbed the Brain Train because it will connect the [[University of Georgia]], [[Emory University]], [[Georgia State University]] and the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]]. Several people have called for a new metropolitan planning committee to manage transportation, but for the time being transportation planning is split among different county and state agencies.

===MARTA finances===
2006 internal and external audits of MARTA corporate spending revealed a pair of MARTA credit cards the transit board reports it never knew about. A controversy erupted when audits revealed its preceding General Manager and CEO Nathaniel Ford and two of his secretaries charged nearly $150,000 over his five years tenure at MARTA.<ref name="MARTA_$$$_BIZ_ATL">{{cite web |url=http://atlanta.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2006/08/21/story3.html?t=printable | title=Ex-MARTA CEO abused credit cards | publisher=Atlanta Business Chronicle | author=Ryan Mahoney | date=2006-08-18 | accessdate=2006-10-27 }}</ref>

Audits of Mr. Ford's spending were initiated at the request suburbian Republican State Rep. Harry Geisinger, second-in-command on the oversight committee, MARTOC. In February 2006, one month after Mr. Ford left MARTA to become executive director of the [[San Francisco Municipal Railway]] he asked the authority to release Ford's credit card records under state sunshine laws.<ref name="MARTA_$$$_BIZ_ATL">{{cite web |url=http://atlanta.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2006/08/21/story3.html?t=printable | title=Ex-MARTA CEO abused credit cards | publisher=Atlanta Business Chronicle | author=Ryan Mahoney | date=2006-08-18 | accessdate=2006-10-27 }}</ref>

Mr. Ford primarily charged business-related expenses -- meals and drinks at fine restaurants, trips to industry conventions across the country, etc. But other charges were of a purely personal nature, $454.00 at a golf pro shop, $335.00 in clothing from Men's Wearhouse and a $58.00 visit to the dentist.<ref name="MARTA_$$$_BIZ_ATL">{{cite web |url=http://atlanta.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2006/08/21/story3.html?t=printable | title=Ex-MARTA CEO abused credit cards | publisher=Atlanta Business Chronicle | author=Ryan Mahoney | date=2006-08-18 | accessdate=2006-10-27 }}</ref> MARTA internal auditor, Jonnie Keith, determined Mr. Ford had reimbursed the authority for about $10,500.00 in personal expenses charged to the cards during his tenure. In response to Ms Keith's audit, Ford sent MARTA a check for $1,000.00, Keith said.<ref name="MARTA_$$$_BIZ_ATL">{{cite web |url=http://atlanta.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2006/08/21/story3.html?t=printable | title=Ex-MARTA CEO abused credit cards | publisher=Atlanta Business Chronicle | author=Ryan Mahoney | date=2006-08-18 | accessdate=2006-10-27 }}</ref>

Rick Simonetta, MARTA's general manager from 1994 through 1999, also used the cards, but that use was never a problem. according to Mr. Wall.<ref name="MARTA_$$$_BIZ_ATL">{{cite web |url=http://atlanta.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2006/08/21/story3.html?t=printable | title=Ex-MARTA CEO abused credit cards | publisher=Atlanta Business Chronicle | author=Ryan Mahoney | date=2006-08-18 | accessdate=2006-10-27 }}</ref>

The criticism of Mr. Ford's credit card. are unlikely to affect his current position according to his supervisors at MTA. MTA spokeswoman Maggie Lynch said she felt the audits were intended to tear down Ford's accomplishments at MARTA's helm. MTA board members do not consider the allegations relevant to his current post. In July 2006 MARTA reported its first operating profit in nine years on increased ridership and higher revenue from the sales tax that supplies most of its funding.

Further scrutiny of spending during Mr. Ford's tenure revealed an additional credit card with charges involving two of his secretaries, Iris Anthony and Stephannie Smart. Ms Smart used the cards to pay approximately $6000.00 in private expenses. The credit card charges were primarily made on a second credit card held by Ms Anthony. Both Ms Smart and Ms Anthony left MARTA shortly before Mr Ford resigned. According to Mr. Wall Ms Smart has agreed to repay MARTA $6000.00. As of October 2006 it is not known if Ms Smart has made good on her promise. In January, Ms Anthony filed a civil lawsuit against Mr. Ford alleging sexual harassment and abusive behavior.<ref name="MARTA_$$$_BIZ_ATL">{{cite web |url=http://atlanta.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2006/08/21/story3.html?t=printable | title=Ex-MARTA CEO abused credit cards | publisher=Atlanta Business Chronicle | author=Ryan Mahoney | date=2006-08-18 | accessdate=2006-10-27 }}</ref>

The unprecedented inquiry into MARTA's corporate spending was launched by Republican state legislators. In 2005 Georgia Republican gained control of both the House of Representatives and Senate, the first time they had done so since the 19th century.<ref name="MARTA_$$$_BIZ_ATL">{{cite web |url=http://atlanta.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2006/08/21/story3.html?t=printable | title=Ex-MARTA CEO abused credit cards | publisher=Atlanta Business Chronicle | author=Ryan Mahoney | date=2006-08-18 | accessdate=2006-10-27 }}</ref>
