'''Michael Peter Balzary''' (born [[October 16]], [[1962]] in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]), more commonly known by the [[Stage name|stage name]] '''Flea''', is an [[United States|American]] [[bassist]], [[trumpet]] player and [[session musician]]. He is best known as the bassist of the [[alternative rock]] band [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], of which he is a founding member. His work with the band incorporates several musical styles, ranging from aggressive [[Slapping|slap bass]], to more subdued and melodic techniques. Aside from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Flea has collaborated with many artists, including [[Jane's Addiction]] and [[Alanis Morissette]]. 

Flea first learned to play bass in high school after being taught by close friend and future Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist [[Hillel Slovak]], who needed a bassist for his band [[What Is This?|Anthym]]. Flea eventually joined the group, but left after a few years to join the [[punk rock]] group [[Fear (band)|Fear]]. Flea rejoined Slovak to form an intended one-off band along with fellow high school alumni [[Anthony Kiedis]] and [[Jack Irons]]. This band soon evolved into the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

==Biography==
=== Early life ===
Flea was born in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] on [[October 16]], [[1962]]. His father, Mick Balzary, was an avid fisherman and would often take him fishing.<ref name=fcinterview>{{cite web|url=http://youtube.com/watch?v=DYzpn6vLBgo|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers Fan Club Interview, 1989|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=2007-12-30}}</ref> When Flea was five, his family relocated to [[Rye (city), New York|Rye]], [[New York]] for his father's job.<ref name=apterp19>Apter, 2004. p. 19</ref> In 1971, his parents divorced and his father returned to Australia. Flea and his siblings stayed with their mother Patricia, who soon remarried to a jazz musician and bassist.<ref name=apterp19/> Flea's stepfather frequently invited musicians to his house and [[jam session]]s would often take place. The family relocated again to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], and Flea became fascinated with [[trumpet]].<ref name=apterpg20>Apter, 2004. p. 20</ref><ref name=AMGbio>{{Cite web|url=http://wm03.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:0bfyxqt5ld0e~T1|title=Biography of Flea|author=Prato, Greg|accessdate=2007-12-15|publisher=[[All Music Guide]]}}</ref> He had no interest in [[rock music]] at the time and idolized jazz musicians like [[Miles Davis]], [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[Dizzy Gillespie]].<ref name=apterpg20/> 

His stepfather, however, was an "aggressive alcoholic" who eventually became involved in shoot-outs with police. Flea recalled of the situation: "I was raised in a very violent, alcoholic household. I grew up being terrified of my parents, particularly my father figures. It caused [me] a lot of trouble later in life."<ref name=apterpg21>Apter, 2004. p. 21</ref> In order to cope with this situation, Flea started to experiment heavily in drugs when he was 13, especially [[marijuana]], which he started smoking on a daily basis.<ref name=apterpgs20>Apter, 2004. pp. 22-23</ref>

Flea attended [[Fairfax High School (Los Angeles)|Fairfax High School]], and was somewhat of an outcast due to his taste in music.<ref name=apterpgs20/> However, he soon met [[Anthony Kiedis]], and after a fight, the two became best friends.<ref name=apterpg34>Apter, 2004. p. 34</ref> Kiedis recalled, "We were drawn to each other by the forces of mischief and love and we became virtually inseparable. We were both social outcasts. We found each other and it turned out to be the longest-lasting friendship of my life."<ref name=apterpg35>Apter, 2004. p. 35</ref> Kiedis became a significant influence on Flea, turning him on to rock music, particularly punk rock.<ref name=apterpg35/> Flea soon adopted his nickname, given to him by Kiedis while the two were on a [[skiing]] trip in reference to his jumpy and capricious nature.<ref name=apterpg35/>

===1980-1984: Formation of the Red Hot Chili Peppers===
Flea was also close friends with [[Hillel Slovak]], the guitarist of a local band called Anthym. When the band's original bassist, [[Todd Strassman]], left the band, Slovak began teaching Flea to play [[Bass guitar|bass]].<ref name=apterpgs40>Apter, 2004. pp. 40-45</ref> Following several months of commitment to the instrument, Flea developed proficiency and joined the group. Shortly thereafter, Anthym entered a local "Battle of the Bands" contest and won second place.<ref name=apterpgs40/> During his tenure with the group, Flea began to develop a style of [[slapping|slap bass]] that would become prominent in future Red Hot Chili Peppers songs. Anthym started to play at local nightclubs, despite the fact that the members were all underage. Flea, Slovak, and Kiedis became best friends, and often partook in the recreational use of [[LSD]], [[heroin]], [[cocaine]], and [[Amphetamine|speed]].<ref name=apterpgs40/> 

The threesome became fans of the growing punk rock movement in Los Angeles at the time. Flea went from despising the genre to listening to it exclusively: "The beautiful thing about punk rock was the intensity, the energy. And punk deflated the whole bloated rock-star thing. I think that musicians who don't pay attention to punk have a gap in their knowledge that makes it difficult to communicate in this day in age."<ref name=apterpgs40/> Anthym changed their name to [[What Is This?]], and rapidly became a local club favorite—frequently attracting more than thirty people per show. The band was faltering internally however, and Flea left the group to play bass for a well-established L.A. punk rock group called [[Fear (band)|Fear]].<ref name=apterpgs50>Apter, 2004. pp. 50-56</ref> Although Fear was a thriving act, Flea was discontent in the band and left shortly after joining.<ref name=apterpgs50/> He then successfully auditioned for the role of bassist in the British [[post-punk]] group [[Public Image Ltd.]], but rejected the offer; he later admitted that the only reason he auditioned was to jam with the band's frontman [[John Lydon]].<ref name=apterpgs50/>

Slovak, Kiedis, and Flea began to create their own music after finding inspiration in a punk-funk fusion band called [[Defunkt]].<ref name=MOJO>Page, Scarlet (July, 2004). "Red Hot Chili Peppers: The LA Punks Who Defied Death, Grunge And A Burning Crack Den". ''Mojo''.</ref> Flea, Slovak, Kiedis and former Anthym-drummer [[Jack Irons]] formed a band called Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem. The band had only one song, entitled "Out in L.A.", and was formed for the purpose of playing the song once.<ref name=apterpg60>Apter, 2004. p. 60</ref> Following the group's first show at The Rhythm Lounge, the owner of the bar asked them to return, but with two songs instead of one. After several more shows, and the addition of several songs to their repertoire, the band's name was changed to Red Hot Chili Peppers.<ref name=apterpg61>Apter, 2004. p. 61</ref><ref name=VH1behindthemusic>{{cite episode | title = [http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/behind_the_music/51363/episode_about.jhtml Red Hot Chili Peppers] | series = [[Behind the Music]] | network = [[VH1]] | airdate = 1999-05-30 | accessdate=2007-08-27}}</ref>

===1984-1990: First four albums===
The band's concert repertoire grew to nine songs, as a result months of playing local nightclubs and bars.<ref name=apterpg62>Apter, 2004. p. 62</ref> The Red Hot Chili Peppers entered Bijou Studios to record a demo tape and subsequently secured a record deal with [[EMI]].<ref name=VH1behindthemusic/> Irons and Slovak however, decided to leave the Chili Peppers in order to pursue a "more serious" future with What Is This?.<ref name=apterpgs70>Apter, 2004. pp. 70-74</ref> Flea ultimately respected the decision, but felt the band would be lost without them. He and Kiedis hired drummer [[Cliff Martinez]] and guitarist [[Jack Sherman]] to fill Iron's and Slovak's places, respectively.<ref name=apterpgs70/> [[Andy Gill]], formerly of [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang of Four]], agreed to produce their first album. Gill and Sherman clashed with Flea and Kiedis; they continuously argued over music style, sound, and the album's production.<ref name=apterpgs78>Apter, 2004. pp. 78-88</ref> Flea himself felt that the album "was a big mistake", but also admited "...we [he and Kiedis] were just disrespectful and obnoxious."<ref name=MOJO/> The band's eponymous debut album, [[The Red Hot Chili Peppers (album)|''The Red Hot Chili Peppers'']], was released on [[August 10]], [[1984]] to largely poor critical and commercial review.<ref>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. pp. 234-235</ref> After a relatively unfruitful tour, Sherman was fired in early 1985. Slovak, who had been contemplating a return to the Chili Peppers, rejoined the group after being encouraged by Flea.<ref name=RHCPbio>{{Cite web|url=http://wm03.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:difrxqr5ldje~T1|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers Biography|author=Prato, Greg|accessdate=2007-12-15|publisher=All Music Guide}}</ref>

Funk musician [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]] was hired to produce the band's second album, ''[[Freaky Styley]]''. The strong chemistry between Clinton and the Chili Peppers was felt instantly. Flea later referred to Clinton as "the warmest, kindest man in the world."<ref name=apterpg110>Apter, 2004. p. 110</ref> The mood throughout production was far more positive than that of the band's previous record.<ref name=apterpg115>Apter, 2004. pp. 114-120</ref> When ''Freaky Styley'' was released in August of 1985, however, it received only a bit more attention than ''The Red Hot Chili Peppers'' with roughly 75,000 copies sold by year end.<ref name=MOJO/> Flea was somewhat indifferent to the poor album sales; as he had recently proposed to girlfriend Loesha Zeviar, who was pregnant with their child.<ref name=apterpg127>Apter, 2004. p. 127</ref> 

The band hired [[Michael Beinhorn]], their last resort among potential producers, to work on their next album<ref name=aptr133>Apter, 2004. pp 130-141</ref> What Is This? had finally disbanded, and Irons returned to the Chili Peppers in mid 1986 after Martinez was fired. Flea, Slovak and Kiedis especially were involved in heavy drug use and their relationships became strained. Flea recalled that "it began to seem ugly to me and not fun; our communication was not healthy."<ref name=aptr133/> Kiedis became dependent on heroin, leaving Flea and Slovak to work on much of the album's material by themselves. Flea and Zeviar married, and she gave birth their daughter Clara. Kiedis was briefly kicked out of the band, and given a month to rehabilitate. Kiedis completed the rehab and rejoined the Red Hot Chili Peppers in Los Angeles to record their third album ''[[The Uplift Mofo Party Plan]]''.<ref name=aptr133/> Flea has referred to the album as "the 'rockingest' record" the band has ever made.<ref name=aptr133/> ''The Uplift Mofo Party Plan'' proved to be far more successful, commercially and critically, than the Chili Peppers' preceding albums; registering at #148 on the [[Billboard Top 200|''Billboard'' Top 100]].<ref name=billboardrhcp>{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Albums&model.vnuArtistId=5507&model.vnuAlbumId=815996|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers Albums Charting|accessdate=2007-09-12|publisher=''Billboard''}}</ref> Following the ''Uplift'' tour, Slovak's drug use dramatically increased. Flea's relationship with Slovak faded, and Slovak became isolated and depressed.<ref name=MOJO/> On [[June 28]] [[1988]], Slovak was found dead of a heroin overdose. Flea reflected: "I didn't really know how to deal with that sadness, and I don't think [Kiedis] knew how to deal with it either."<ref name=MOJO/> Irons, who was taking Slovak's death particularly hard, left the group.<ref name=VH1behindthemusic/>

Flea and Kiedis took some time to collect themselves, but decided to keep the band together. Guitarist [[DeWayne "Blackbyrd" McKnight]] and drummer [[D.H. Peligro]] were added, and the band entered the studio to record a new album. McKnight soon began to create tension within the group, as his style did not mesh with the rest of the band.<ref name=Kiedis234-239>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 234</ref> Peligro was a friend of [[John Frusciante]], an eighteen year old guitarist and avid Chili Peppers fan.<ref name="rs-fricke">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/chilipeppers_tattooed_love_boys/page/1|author=Fricke, David|date=[[June 15]], [[2006]]|title=Tattooed Love Boys: After twenty-three years, nine albums, death, love, and addiction, the Red Hot Chili Peppers are at Number One for the very first time|accessdate=2007-10-02|publisher=''Rolling Stone''}}</ref>  Peligro introduced Frusciante to Flea, and the three jammed together on several occasions.<ref name=apterpg178>Apter, 2004. pp. 178-190</ref> Flea was impressed with Frusciante's skill, and astonished by his knowledge of the Chili Peppers' repertoire. Flea realized that Frusciante could provide the spark McKnight was lacking.<ref name=MMliner>''Mother's Milk'' 2003 reissue liner notes</ref> McKnight was fired, and Frusciante accepted an invitation to join the band.<ref name=Kiedis234-239/> A few weeks into the band's new lineup, Peligro was becoming unable to keep his substance abuse under control. His performance suffered severely and he was fired from the band.<ref>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 242</ref> The band held a widely-publicized audition, and hired [[Chad Smith]]—the last of over thirty to audition.<ref>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 233</ref> Flea and Zeviar started to grow apart, and he began trying to recreate the memories of his adolescence by smoking marijuana on a daily basis.<ref name=apterpg178/> The Chili Peppers entered the studio, and completed recording of their fourth album, ''[[Mother's Milk]]'', in early 1989. Upon release, the album was met with mixed reactions from critics, but received far more commercial attention; peaking at #58 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 200.<ref name=billboardrhcp/>

===1990-1998: Mainstream success and side projects===
The ensuing ''Mother's Milk'' tour put a strain on Flea's marriage. In order to make money, he needed to tour, and therefore spend time away from his family.<ref name=apterpg205>Apter, 2004. pp. 205-212</ref> The band was attracting over three thousand people per show; ''Mother's Milk'' had been [[RIAA certification|certified]] as a [[Music recording sales certification|gold]] record in early 1990.<ref name=RIAA>{{Cite web|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH|title=RIAA Searchable Database|publisher=[[RIAA]]|accessdate=2007-12-15}}</ref> Singles "Knock Me Down" and "Higher Ground" were breaking the top ten in charts like [[Modern Rock Tracks]].<ref name="Billboard singles">{{cite web| url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.vnuArtistId=5507&model.vnuAlbumId=815996|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers Artist Chart History: Singles| publisher=''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''| accessdate=2007-12-16}}</ref> By the time Flea returned to Los Angeles, however, he and Zeviar agreed to a separation.<ref name=apterpg205/> He tried to put the separation out of his mind by smoking marijuana and having sex with willing fans.<ref name=apterpg205/>
[[Image:FleaandCobain1992.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Flea (left) with [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] front man [[Kurt Cobain]] (right) in 1992 when Red Hot Chili Peppers were touring with them]]
When the tour was over, the Red Hot Chili Peppers severed ties with EMI and signed with [[Warner Bros. Records]].<ref name=sctisswarner>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. pp. 261–262</ref> Rick Rubin, who rejected an opportunity to produce ''Mother's Milk'', agreed to produce their next album.<ref name=apterpg220>Apter, 2004. pp. 220-236</ref> Flea had largely used the principal slap bass technique on the band's preceding four albums, and decided to downplay this style in favor of more conventional, melodic bass lines.<ref name=Funkymonks>''Funky Monks'', 1991. Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc.</ref> To record the album, Rubin suggested a mansion that belonged to former magician [[Harry Houdini]]. Flea felt it was "a creatively fertile situation", and decided to bring his daughter Clara with him.<ref name=apterpg220/> He and the rest of the band, excluding Smith, remained inside the house for the entire recording process. When not writing or recording the album, Flea spent a large portion of his time with Frusciante smoking large quantities of marijuana.<ref name=apterpg220/> When ''[[Blood Sugar Sex Magik]]'' was released on [[September 24]], [[1991]], it received an overwhelmingly positive critical response. The album peaked at #3 on the Billboard Hot 200, and went on to sell over seven million copies in the U.S. alone.<ref name=RHCPbio/><ref name=billboardrhcp/> The album's ensuing tour was critically acclaimed—the Chili Peppers commonly performed shows with over twenty thousand in attendance.<ref name=p282>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 282</ref> [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]]-based [[Grunge music|grunge]] band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] also toured with them during the West Coast leg of their United States tour.<ref name=p282/> The massive attention the Chili Peppers started receiving, however, caused Frusciante to feel extremely uncomfortable, and he abruptly quit the band during the Japanese leg of  the album's tour.<ref name=rollingstonearticle>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/redhotchilipeppers/articles/story/5938432/the_naked_truth|title=The Naked Truth|author=David Fricke|accessdate=2007-08-10|publisher=''Rolling Stone''}}</ref> The band hired guitarist [[Arik Marshall]] to complete the remaining tour dates.

Marshall was fired at the end of the tour, and the band added former [[Jane's Addiction]] guitarist [[Dave Navarro]] to record an new album. Kiedis was in the middle of a heroin relapse, which forced Flea to assume the role of lyricist; something he had not yet done. He wrote most of the song "Transcending", and the intro to "Deep Kick". Flea also wrote the lyrics to an entire song—"Pea"—which he both sang and played bass on.<ref name=p341>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. pp. 341-344</ref> These three songs were then released on the Chili Peppers' sixth album ''[[One Hot Minute]]''. The album was received mixed reviews and significantly less commercial success than ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik''.<ref name=RHCPbio/> The ''One Hot Minute'' tour was ultimately cut short due to various injuries Kiedis and Smith received, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers decided to go on hiatus.<ref name=apterpg290>Apter, 2004. pp. 290-302</ref> Flea began to practice [[yoga]], and slowly decreased his marijuana consumption.<ref name=apterpg290/> Due to the Chili Peppers' inactivity, Flea and Navarro participated in a Jane's Addiction reunion tour. Rumors spread that the band was breaking up, until Navarro stated otherwise: "I want to clarify that the Chili Peppers are not breaking up...Flea and I are more than happy to do both projects, time permitting."<ref name=apterpg290/> 

Flea also had plans to record a solo album. He asked Chili Peppers manager Lindy Goetz to help him promote the record and his solo career.<ref name=apterpg290/> Flea eventually abandoned the idea in favor of offering his bass services to other artists. He performed on over forty records from 1995 to 1998, ranging from [[Alanis Morissette]]'s ''[[Jagged Little Pill]]'' to former [[Minutemen (band)|Minutemen]] bassist [[Mike Watt]]'s debut solo album ''[[Ball-Hog or Tugboat?]]''. He also worked with [[Tori Amos]] and [[Michael Stipe]] on a track for the soundtrack to ''[[Don Juan DeMarco]]''.<ref>Apter, 2004. p. 281</ref> Navarro was fired from the Chili Peppers in 1998, and Flea questioned whether or not the Red Hot Chili Peppers would stay together: "the only way I could imagine carrying on is if we got John [Frusciante] back in the band."<ref name=pp2>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. pp. 390-395</ref> Frusciante had completed drug rehabilitation in 1997 after a severe addiction to [[heroin]] and [[crack cocaine]] left him on the brink of death.<ref name="pnt">{{cite web | last = Wilonsky | first = Robert | url = http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1996-12-12/music/blood-on-the-tracks/| title = Blood on the Tracks | publisher = ''Phoenix New Times Music'' | date = [[December 12]], [[1996]] | accessdate = 2007-06-22 }}</ref> Flea visited Frusciante in early 1998, inviting him back to the Chili Peppers; an emotional Frusciante readily accepted.<ref>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 408</ref>

===1998-present: ''Californication'', ''By the Way'' and ''Stadium Arcadium''===
The band, with Frusciante back on guitar, began writing new songs during the summer of 1998 in Flea's garage.<ref name=MOJO/> He and Kiedis were less confident in writing the album, after the disappointing results of ''One Hot Minute''.<ref name=MOJO/> Flea had also recently broken up with his girlfriend of two years, Marissa Pouw, causing him to enter a state of depression,<ref name=apterpg300>Apter, 2004. pp. 304-311</ref> which was only lifted when his daughter, Clara, comforted him after several weeks of crying.<ref name=MOJO/>

Flea was heavily influenced by [[electronica]] during the writing and recording of ''[[Californication (album)|Californication]]'' and he attempted to emulate this when writing bass lines for the album.<ref name=apterpg300/> ''Californication'' took less than two weeks to record; by contrast, ''One Hot Minute'' took over a year. When ''Californication'' was released on [[June 8]], [[1999]] it received overwhelmingly positive critical reviews and sold fifteen million copies worldwide—more than ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik''.<ref name=MOJO/> The Chili Peppers played [[Woodstock 1999]], with Flea playing completely naked—something he would do again at the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]] the same year.<ref name=apterpg300/> In 2001, Flea founded the Silverlake Conservatory of Music, a school dedicated to help youth progress in music.<ref name=apterpg320>Apter, 2004. pp. 327-338</ref> 

Red Hot Chili Peppers spent most of 2001 writing their eighth studio album, ''[[By the Way]]''. The entire band began listening to more melodic, textured music that would reflect heavily on the album.<ref name=MOJO/> Frusciante became the driving force behind ''By the Way'', causing initial strife between him and Flea.<ref name=apterpg300/> If the bassist introduced a funk rhythm into his bass lines, the guitarist would consequently disapprove.<ref name=apterpg300/> ''By the Way'' was released on [[July 9]], [[2002]] to positive critical reviews. Although not as successful as ''Californication'' or ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'', ''By the Way'' would go on to sell over nine million copies worldwide.<ref name=btwsales>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/online_downloads/red_hot_chili_peppers_first_single_preview_posted_online.html|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers: First Single Preview|publisher=Total Guitar|accessdate=2007-10-09}}</ref>

After another two year world tour, the Chili Peppers wrote their ninth studio album ''[[Stadium Arcadium]]''. In 2005, Flea became engaged to his girlfriend Frankie Rayder, and the two bore his second daughter Sunny Bebop, later the same year.<ref name=itunesinterview>Red Hot Chili Peppers.
