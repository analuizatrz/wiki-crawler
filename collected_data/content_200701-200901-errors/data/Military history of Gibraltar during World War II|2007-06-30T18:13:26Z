[[Gibraltar]] has been a [[United Kingdom|British]] fortress and bulwark for over 300 years and a vital factor in British strategy in all wars, both as a last foothold on the [[Europe|Continent of Europe]], and as a bastion of [[Royal Navy|British sea power]].   From the first days of [[World War II]], the [[Rock of Gibraltar|Rock]] became a vital pivot of the [[Mediterranean]]. Under continuous threat, Gibraltar survived. [[Operation Torch]], the invasion of [[North Africa]] was coordinated from the Rock.  

==Evacuation==

[[World War II]] dramatically changed the lives of all [[Gibraltar|Gibraltarians]]. The decision to enforce mass [[evacuation]] in order to increase the strength of the [[Rock of Gibraltar|Rock]] with more [[military]] and [[navy|naval]] personnel meant that most Gibraltarians (some for as long as ten years) had nowhere to call ‘home’. Only those civilians with essential jobs were entitled to stay but it gave the entire community a sense of being ‘British’ by sharing in the war effort. 

In June 1940 about 13,500 evacuees were shipped to [[Casablanca]] in [[French Morocco]] but following the [[Capitulation (surrender)|capitulation]] of the [[France|French]] to the [[Nazi Germany|German]] armies in June 1940, the new Pro-German French Vichy Government found the presence of Gibraltarian evacuees in Casablanca an embarrassment and looked for ways for their removal. The opportunity soon arose when 15 British [[cargo ship|cargo vessels]] arrived under Commodore Crichton repatriating 15,000 French servicemen who has been rescued from [[Battle of Dunkirk|Dunkirk]].  Once their own rescued servicemen had disembarked, the ships were arrested until they agreed to take away all the evacuees. Although Crichton was unable to obtain permission to clean and restock his ships (and contrary to [[Admiralty|British Admiralty]] orders which forbade the taking on of evacuees) when he saw the mass of civilians pouring through the dockyards, he opened up his gangways for boarding. However, when they arrived at Gibraltar, the [[Governor of Gibraltar |Governor]] would not allow them to land fearing that once on the Rock, it would be virtually impossible to evacuate them a second time. Crowds gathered in John Macintosh square, in the centre of Gibraltar as the news broke, speeches were made and two [[Local government in the United Kingdom#Councils and councillors|City Councillors]] accompanied by the Acting President of the Exchange and Commercial Library went to see the Governor (Sir Clive Liddel) to ask that the evacuees be allowed to land. After receiving instructions from [[London]], a landing was allowed as long as the evacuees returned when other ships arrived to take them away from the Rock., and by [[13 July]] the re-evacuation back to Gibraltar had been completed.

[[Oliver Stanley]] agreed to accept the evacuees in the United Kingdom, but he argued with Gibraltar over the number of people involved. The Governor, he declared, had given the number of evacuees first as 13,000, then as 14,000 and finally as 16,000. He asked for the situation to be clarified, stressing the shortage of accommodation in Britain and insisting that only 13,000 could be accepted, 2000 of whom were to be sent to the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] Atlantic island of [[Madeira]]. The situation, replied General Liddel on [[19 July]], ‘is that this is a fortress liable to heave and immediate attack and there should be no civilians here whereas there are 22,000. The 13,000 was the number sent to [[Morocco]], and more would have been sent had the situation there not altered.’
In London the evacuees were placed in the hands of the [[Ministry of Health]], and many were housed in [[Kensington]] area. Concern for them in Gibraltar mounted as the air raids against London intensified, coupled with the arrival of harrowing letters, describing the circumstances in which the evacuees were living. <ref>GGA, Evacuation 1940: General Mechanics of </ref>

In September rumours were already circulating among the evacuees, and in Gibraltar, that the possibility of re-evacuating the Gibraltarians once more was being mooted, this time the destination being [[Jamaica]], in the [[Caribbean|West Indies]]. After much contention, it was decided to send a party directly from Gibraltar to the island, and 1,093 evacuees left for Jamaica direct, on [[9 October]], with more following later on. However petitions followed and the demands were met, partly for strategic reasons and the lack of available shipping. The situation at the end of 1940, therefore, was that approximately 2,000 evacuees were in Jamaica and a lesser number in Madeira, with the bulk of around 10,000 housed in the London area.

==Repatriation==
{{lquote|...a matter so fraught with hysteria and heart burning...}}
<sub>Miles Clifford, [[Colonial Secretary]] to the [[Colonial Office]], 11 July 1944</sub>


The surrender of Italy in September 1943 lifted any possible objections to the return of the evacuees to the Rock. As a result a Resettlement Board was established in November, and at a meeting of the Board on [[8 February]] [[1944]] [[repatriation]] priorities were finally agreed. On [[6 April]] [[1944]] the first group of 1367 repatriates arrived on the Rock directly from the United Kingdom and on [[28 May]], the first repatriation party left Madeira, and by the end of 1944 only 520 non-priority evacuees remained on the island. 

In London, home-comers were making claims on the evacuees’ wartime accommodation and 500 Gibraltarians were re-evacuated to [[Scotland]] and 3,000 to camps in [[Northern Ireland]]. Although the Governor, Lt. General Sir Noel Mason-MacFarlane, fought valiantly on behalf of the evacuees and did not accept the lack of accommodation as a sufficient reason for the delays. As late as 1947 there were still 2,000 in Irish camps. The last of the evacuees did not see the Rock again until 1951.

For the aerial attack on the harbour of Gibraltar forces are to be designated which will guarantee abundant success. For the subsequent operations against naval objectives and for support of the attack of the Rock mainly dive bombers units are to be transferred to Spain. Sufficient anti-aircraft artillery is to be allocated to the army units including its use against ground targets.

The Rock came through the war relatively unscathed but there was little doubt that [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] had made plans to capture Gibraltar. The plan, codenamed ‘Felix’ was devised at the highest level of command and was signed by [[Adolf Hitler]]. It involved prompt entry through [[Spain]] (with or without permission) and driving the British out of the Western Mediterranean. With Gibraltar taken, the [[Strait of Gibraltar|Strait]] would be effectively closed to the Allies. The Rock was to be heavily dive bombed by planes leaving France but landing afterwards at Spanish air bases. The final attack to seize Gibraltar was to be made by German troops alone, thus Spain was to be denied possession. However, General [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]’s wavering neutrality caused Hitler to hesitate and with the opening of the war on the Russian front, Hitler was obliged to postpone plan ‘Felix’. Not taking Gibraltar in the south certainly altered the course of the war.

==Operation Tracer==
A document came to light in the top secret files of the offices of British [[naval intelligence]] giving details of the plan, codenamed ''Operation Tracer'', which was hatched during the darkest days of the Second World War. 

Six men were to be sealed in a cave with only two small openings to the outside world and left with enough supplies for one year. They were told there would be no way out and anyone who died within the chamber would have to be embalmed and cemented into the walls. Only if Germany was defeated within a year would they be released. 

The volunteers – two doctors, three signalmen and their leader – would run an observation post from the two 12 inch by 6 inch slits, one looking due east out over the Mediterranean and the other west over the Strait and the harbour and wireless back all shipping movements to the [[Admiralty|British Admiralty]]. 

The potential menace of Germany’s invasion was seen as a very real threat and by late 1941, ideas for a series of secret observation posts first in Gibraltar and later in other places like [[Malta]] and [[Aden]] were put together as Operation Tracer. 

Work at Gibraltar began immediately under Commander Geoffry Birley and his chief engineer Colonel Fordham. The site chosen at Lord Airey’s Battery on the southern tip of the Rock already had an existing tunnelling scheme for a shelter. 

Extensive trials of the equipment began in January 1942 under the eye of [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] radio expert Colonel Gambier-Parry. Much thought was also given to the type of men needed for such a strange and demanding task.

A member of [[Terra Nova Expedition|Scott’s ill-fated expedition to the Antarctic]], Murray Levick was called up as Surgeon-Commander to advise on survival techniques. There were practical matters such as diet, exercise, sanitation and clothing to consider as well as vital ‘psychology of the personnel’. 

The full team were in place by the end of summer 1942 and their cavern fully equipped and ready for occupation. A comprehensive manual was prepared on all aspects of the operation and it was considered that similar secret lookout posts should be prepared throughout the world in the event of future wars. However, Operation Tracer was never needed, as [[Adolf Hitler]] turned his attention away from Gibraltar and towards the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. 

The operation had been clouded in mystery until the discovery of papers at the [[Public Records Office]] in [[Kew]] [[UK]]. In the 1960s details of the story were told to a journalist by his intelligence service contacts and he wrote these up as ‘Operation Monkey’ yet facts were very sparse. 

In 1997 'Stay Behind Cave' (as it was nicknamed) was discovered in Gibraltar but no account was ever obtained from anyone associated with the mission. In November 2006 Jim Crone and Sergeant Major Pete Jackson, senior tunnel guide with the [[Royal Gibraltar Regiment]], met possibly the only member of Operation Tracer still alive when they travelled to meet Dr. W. A. Bruce Cooper at his home in [[England]].

Cooper (92 at the time) provided an opportunity to shed light on the operation with his direct involvement in the mission as a [[Lieutenant|Surgeon-Lieutenant]] in the [[Royal Naval Reserve|Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve]] (RNVR). He recalled stories about his colleagues, his training, and his feelings about the task.

==War tunnels==
Given that Gibraltar was a small town with only a few defences protecting it, the solution was to build a massive series of tunnels and chambers inside the natural protection of the [[Rock of Gibraltar]]. This town inside the rock contained its own power station, water supply, and hospital. Some soldiers posted here would not see the light of day for months on end. Royal Engineers (originally the Artificer Company during the Great Siege) along with a Canadian contingent added some 30 miles (45km) of such tunnels.

==Death of Władysław Sikorski==
{{main|Władysław Sikorski}}
On [[July 4]], [[1943]], a [[B-24 Liberator|Liberator bomber]] from RAF Transport Command took off from Gibraltar for England. On board was General [[Władysław Sikorski]], Prime Minister of Poland's London-based government in exile and [[Commander-in-Chief]] of its armed forces, returning from visiting Polish troops in the Middle East. 

The aircraft climbed normally from the runway, levelled off to gather speed but then suddenly lost height and crashed into the harbour. The 62-year-old general died, along with 15 others. The sole survivor was the Czech-born pilot, Max Prchal, who was rescued by an RAF launch. The bodies of five passengers and crew, including Sikorski's daughter, were never found. <ref>[http://www.fpp.co.uk/History/Sikorski/Times040703.html ''The Times'' - Real History and the Death of General Sikorski]</ref>

The mysterious events of General Sikorski's death gave rise to speculation that Sikorski's death had been no accident, and may in fact have been the direct result of a Soviet, British or even Polish conspiracy<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5307448.stm 'Polish soldier's 'fishy' sabotage tale'] BBC [[4 September]] [[2006]]</ref>.
