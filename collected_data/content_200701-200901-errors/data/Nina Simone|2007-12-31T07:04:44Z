'''Eunice Kathleen Waymon''', better known by her [[stage name]] '''Nina Simone'''  ([[February 21]], [[1933]] – [[April 21]], [[2003]]), was an [[United States|American]] [[singer]], [[songwriter]], [[pianist]], arranger and [[civil rights]] [[activist]].

Although she disliked being categorized, Simone is generally classified as a [[jazz]] [[musician]]. She preferred the term "Black Classical Music" herself. Simone originally aspired to become a classical pianist, but her work covers an eclectic variety of musical styles besides her [[classical music|classical]] basis, such as jazz, [[soul music|soul]], [[folk music|folk]], [[rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[gospel music|gospel]], and [[pop music]]. Her vocal style (with a rich [[alto]] vocal range<ref>{{cite book |last = Brun-Lambert|title = Nina Simone, het tragische lot van een uitzonderlijke zangeres| pages = p. 57}}</ref>) is characterized by intense passion, breathiness, and [[tremolo]].  Sometimes known as the '''High Priestess of Soul''', she paid great attention to the musical expression of emotions. Within one album or concert she could fluctuate between exuberant happiness or tragic [[melancholy]]. These fluctuations also characterized her own personality and personal life, worsened by a [[bipolar disorder]] with which she was diagnosed in the mid-sixties, but was kept secret until 2004.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hampton|title= Break Down And Let It All Out |pages= pp. 9-13}}</ref> 

Simone recorded over 40 live and studio albums, the biggest body of her work being released between 1958 (when she made her [[debut album|debut]] with ''[[Little Girl Blue (Nina Simone album)|Little Girl Blue]]'') and 1974. Songs she is best known for include "[[My Baby Just Cares for Me]]", "[[I Put A Spell On You|I Put a Spell On You]]", "[[I Loves You Porgy]]", "[[Feeling Good]]", "[[Sinnerman]]", "[[To Be Young, Gifted and Black]]", "[[Strange Fruit]]", and "[[Nuff Said|Ain't got no-I got life]]". Her music and message made a strong and lasting impact on [[African-American]] culture<ref name=seeingblack>{{cite web |url= http://www.seeingblack.com/2003/x060403/nina_simone.shtml|title= Nina Simone: She Cast a Spell—and Made a Choice|accessdate=2007-08-14 |author=Mark Anthony Neal|date=2003-06-04 |year=2003 |month=6 }}</ref>, illustrated by the numerous contemporary artists citing her as an important influence (among them [[Alicia Keys]], [[Jeff Buckley]], and [[Lauryn Hill]]), as well as the extensive use of her music on [[soundtrack]]s and in [[remix]]es.

==Biography==
===Youth (1933–1954)===
Simone was born Eunice Kathleen Waymon in [[Tryon, North Carolina|Tryon]], [[North Carolina]], one of eight children. She began playing piano at her local [[church]] and showed prodigious talent on this instrument. Her concert debut, a classical piano recital, was made at the age of ten. During her performance, her parents, who had taken seats in the front row, were forced to move to the back of the hall to make way for white people. Simone refused to play until her parents were moved back.<ref>{{cite book |last= Simone|title= I Put a Spell on You |pages= p. 26}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Hampton|title= Break Down And Let It All Out |pages= p. 15}}</ref> This incident contributed to her later involvement in the [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|civil rights]] movement. 
[[Image:Ninasimonelittlegirlblue.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Cover of Simone's debut album ''[[Little Girl Blue (Nina Simone album)|Little Girl Blue]]'' (1958), also known as ''Jazz as Played in an Exclusive Side Street Club'']]
Simone's mother, Mary Kate Waymon (who lived into her late 90s) was a strict [[Methodist]] minister; her father, John Divine Waymon, was a handyman and sometime barber who suffered bouts of ill-health. Mrs. Waymon worked as a maid and her employer, hearing of Nina's talent, provided funds for piano lessons.<ref>{{cite book |last= Simone|title= I Put a Spell on You |pages= p. 21}}</ref> Subsequently, a local fund was set up to assist in Eunice's continued education. At seventeen, Simone moved to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], where she taught [[piano]] and accompanied singers to fund her own studying as a [[classical music]] pianist at [[New York City]]'s [[Juilliard School of Music]]. With the help of a private tutor she studied for an interview to further study piano at the [[Curtis Institute]], but she was rejected. Simone believed that this rejection was directly related to her being black, as well as being a woman.<ref>{{cite book |last= Simone|title= I Put a Spell on You |pages= pp. 41-43}}</ref> It further fueled her hatred of the widespread and institutionalized [[racism]] present in the U.S. during the period.

===Early success (1954–1959)===
Simone played at the Midtown Bar & Grill on Pacific Avenue in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]] to fund her study. The owner said that she would have to sing as well as play the piano in order to get the job. She took on the stagename "Nina Simone" in 1954 because she did not want her mother to know that she was playing "the devil's music". "Nina" (from "niña", meaning "little girl" in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) was a nickname a boyfriend had given to her and "Simone" was after the French actress [[Simone Signoret]], whom she had seen in the movie ''[[Casque d'or]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last = Brun-Lambert|title = Nina Simone, het tragische lot van een uitzonderlijke zangeres| pages = p. 56}}</ref> Simone played and sang a mixture of jazz, blues and classical music at the bar, and by doing so she created a small but loyal fan base.<ref>{{cite book |last= Simone|title= I Put a Spell on You |pages= pp. 48-52}}</ref> 

After playing in small clubs she recorded a rendition of [[George Gershwin]]'s "I Loves You Porgy" (from ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'') in 1958, which was learned from a [[Billie Holiday]] album and performed as a favor to a friend. It became her only [[Billboard]] top 40 hit in the [[United States]], and her debut album ''[[Little Girl Blue (Nina Simone album)|Little Girl Blue]]'' soon followed on [[Bethlehem Records]]. Simone would never benefit financially from the album, because she sold the rights for 3000 dollars. It meant that she missed out on more than 1 million dollars of royalties (mainly because of the successful re-release of "[[My Baby Just Cares for Me]]" in the 1980s).<ref>{{cite book |last= Simone|title= I Put a Spell on You |pages= p. 60}}</ref>

===Becoming "popular" (1959-1964)===
After the success of ''Little Girl Blue'', Simone signed a contract with the bigger label [[Colpix Records]], followed by a string of studio and live albums. Colpix relinquished all creative control, including the choice of material that would be recorded, to Nina in exchange for her signing with them.  Simone, who at this point only performed pop music to make money to continue her classical music studies, was bold with her demand for control over her music because she was indifferent about having a recording contract. She would keep this attitude towards the record industry for most of her career.<ref>{{cite book |last= Simone|title= I Put a Spell on You |pages= p. 65}}</ref> 

===Civil rights era (1964–1974)===
[[Image:Ninasimonesilkandsoul.jpg|thumb|200px|right|This photo of Simone on the cover of ''[[Silk & Soul]]'' (1967) is characteristic of her stage appearance in the mid-sixties]]
Simone was made aware of the severity of racial prejudice in America by her friends [[Langston Hughes]], [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]] and [[Lorraine Hansberry]] (author of the play ''[[Raisin in the Sun]]''). In 1964, she changed [[record label]]s, from the American [[Colpix Records|Colpix]] to the Dutch [[Philips Records|Philips]], which also meant a change in the contents of her recordings. Simone had always included songs in her repertoire that hinted to her African-American origins (such as "Brown Baby" and "Zungo" on ''[[Nina at the Village Gate]]'' in 1962). But on her debut album for Philips, ''[[Nina Simone In Concert]]'' (live recording, 1964), Simone for the first time openly addresses the racial inequality that was prevalent in the United States with the song "[[Mississippi Goddam]]". It was her response to the murder of [[Medgar Evers]] and the [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|bombing of a church]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], killing four black children. The song was released as a single, being boycotted in certain southern states.<ref>{{cite book |last= Simone|title= I Put a Spell on You|pages= pp. 90-91}}</ref><ref name=seeingblack/> With "Old Jim Crow" on the same album she reacts to the [[Jim Crow Laws]].

From then onwards, the [[civil rights]] message was standard in Simone's recording repertoire, where it had already become a part of her live performances. Simone performed and spoke at many Civil Rights meetings, such as at the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://boscarol.com/nina/html/manual/crono.html|title= The Nina Simone Web: Chronology|accessdate=2007-08-05 |author= |date= |year= 2003|month= }}</ref> She covered [[Billie Holiday]]'s "[[Strange Fruit]]" (on ''[[Pastel Blues]]'' (1965)), a song about the lynching of black men in the South, and sang the W.Cuney poem "Images" on ''[[Let It All Out]]'' (1966), about the absence of pride in the African-American woman. Simone wrote the song "Four Women" and sings it on ''[[Wild Is the Wind (album)|Wild Is the Wind]]'' (1966). It is about four different stereotypes of African-American women.<ref name=seeingblack/>

Simone again moved from Philips to [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]] in 1967. She sang "Backlash Blues", written by her friend [[Langston Hughes]] on her first RCA album, ''[[Nina Simone Sings The Blues]]'' (1967). On ''[[Silk & Soul]]'' (1967) she recorded [[Billy Taylor]]'s "I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free" and "Turning Point". The last song illustrates how white children would get indoctrinated with racism at an early age. The album ''[[Nuff Said]]'' (1968) contains live recordings from the Westbury Music Fair, [[April 7th]] [[1968]], three days after the murder of [[Dr. Martin Luther King]]. She dedicated the whole performance to him and sang "Why? (The King Of Love Is Dead)", a song written by her [[Bassist|bass player]] directly after the news of Dr. King's death had reached them.<ref>{{cite book |last= Simone|title= I Put a Spell on You|pages= pp. 114-115}}</ref> 

Together with [[Weldon Irvine]], Simone turned the late [[Lorraine Hansberry]]s unfinished play "[[To Be Young, Gifted and Black]]" into a civil rights song. She performed it live on ''[[Black Gold (album)|Black Gold]]'' (1970). A studio recording was released as a single, and the song became the official "National Anthem of Black America" and has been [[cover version|covered]] by [[Aretha Franklin]] (on 1972s ''[[Young, Gifted and Black]]'') and [[Donny Hathaway]].<ref name=legende/><ref name=seeingblack/>

===Later life (1974–2003)===
[[Image:Ninasimoneasinglewoman.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Cover of Simone's last album ''[[A Single Woman]]'' (1993)]]
Simone left the [[United States]] in [[September]] [[1970]]. The continuous performances and decline of the Civil Rights movement had exhausted her. She flew to [[Barbados]], expecting her husband and manager, Andrew Stroud, to contact her when she had to perform again. However, Stroud interpreted Simone's sudden disappearance (and the fact that she left behind her wedding ring) as a cue for a divorce. As her manager, Stroud was also in charge of Simone's income. This meant that after their separation Simone had no knowledge about how her business was run, and what she was actually worth. Upon returning to the United States she also learned that there were serious problems with the tax authorities, causing her to go back to Barbados again.<ref>{{cite book |last=Simone |title= I Put a Spell on You |pages= pp. 120-122}}</ref> Simone stayed in Barbados for quite some time, and had a lengthy affair with the Prime Minister, [[Errol Barrow]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Simone|title= I Put a Spell on You|pages= pp. 129-134}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last = Brun-Lambert|title = Nina Simone, het tragische lot van een uitzonderlijke zangeres| pages = p. 231}}</ref> A close friend, singer [[Miriam Makeba]], convinced her to come to [[Liberia]]. After that she lived in [[Switzerland]] and the [[Netherlands]], before settling in [[France]] in 1992. Simone's divorce from her husband and manager can be seen as the end of her most successful years in the American music business, and the beginning of her (partially self-imposed) exile and estrangement from the world for the next two decades.
<!-- help entangle the information about Simone's tragic later life. It's difficult to create a clear picture because not everything is known about this period, and some things that are known are not really true -->

After her last album for [[RCA Records]], ''[[It Is Finished]]'' (1974), it was not until 1978 that Simone was convinced by [[CTI Records]] owner [[Creed Taylor]] to record another album, ''[[Baltimore (album)|Baltimore]]''. While not a commercial success, the album did get good reviews and marked a quiet artistic renaissance in Simone's recording output. Her voice had not lost its power over the years, but developed an additional warmth and a vivacious maturity.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=18123|title= All about Jazz: review "Fodder on My Wings" & "Baltimore"|accessdate=2007-08-05 |author= Celeste Sunderland |date= 2005-07-01|year= 2005|month= July}}</ref> Her choice of material retained its [[eclecticism]], ranging from spiritual songs to [[Hall & Oates|Hall & Oates']] "Rich Girl". Four years later Simone  recorded ''[[Fodder On My Wings]]'' on a French label. It is one of her most personal albums, with nearly all of the ([[autobiographical]]) songs written by herself. In the 1980s Simone performed regularly at [[Ronnie Scott]]'s jazz club in London, where the album ''[[Live At Ronnie Scott's]]'' was recorded in 1984. Though her on-stage style could be somewhat haughty and aloof, in later years, Simone particularly seemed to enjoy engaging her audiences by recounting sometimes humorous anecdotes related to her career and music and soliciting requests. Her [[autobiography]], ''[[I Put A Spell On You (book)|I Put a Spell on You]]'', was published in 1992 and she recorded her last album, ''[[A Single Woman]]'' in 1993.

In 1993 Simone settled near [[Aix-en-Provence]] in [[Southern France]]. She had been ill with [[breast cancer]] for several years before she died in her sleep at her home in [[Carry-le-Rouet]], [[Bouches-du-Rhône]] on [[April 21]] [[2003]], aged 70. Her funeral service was attended by singers [[Miriam Makeba]] and [[Patti Labelle]], poet [[Sonia Sanchez]], actor [[Ossie Davis]] and hundreds of others. [[Elton John]] sent a floral tribute with the message "We were the greatest and I love you".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/2975871.stm|title= BBCnews: Funeral held for singer Simone|accessdate=2007-07-22|author= |date= 2003-04-25|year= 2003|month= April}}</ref> Simone's ashes were scattered in several [[Africa]]n countries. She left behind a daughter Lisa Celeste, now an actress/singer who took on the stagename [[Simone (actress)|Simone]] and has appeared on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in ''[[Aida]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.talkinbroadway.com/regional/seattle/se54.html|title= Talking Broadway Seattle: Aida|accessdate=2007-08-14 |author= Jonathan Frank}}</ref>

==Simone standards==
Throughout her career, Simone gathered a collection of songs that would become standards in her repertoire (apart from the civil rights songs) and for which she is still remembered, even though most of these songs didn't do well on the charts at the time. These songs were self-written tunes, cover versions (usually with a new arrangement by Simone), or songs written especially for Simone. Her first hit song in America was a cover of [[George Gershwin]]'s "[[I Loves You Porgy]]" (1958). It peaked at number 18 in the pop singles chart and number 2 on the black singles chart.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:ehjn7i78g76r~T3|title= Allmusic Guide: "I Loves You Porgy" Billboard chart position |accessdate=2006-12-07 |format= |work= }}</ref> In that same period Simone recorded "[[My Baby Just Cares for Me]]", which would become her biggest hit years later in 1987, when it featured in a [[Chanel]] no. 5 perfume commercial. A [[music video]] was then created by [[Aardman Studios]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://boscarol.com/nina/html/where/mybabyjustcaresf.html|title= Nina Simone Web: My Baby Just Cares for Me |accessdate=2006-12-07 |author= Mauro Boscarol|format= |work= }}</ref>
<includeonly>!!DON'T put detailed cover/sample/soundtrack use of songs here, only the very basics. Put that sort of information on the ARTICLE ABOUT THE SONG OR ALBUM!!</includeonly>
Well known songs from her Philips albums include "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood" on ''[[Broadway-Blues-Ballads]]'' (1964), "I Put a Spell on You", "Ne Me Quitte Pas" and "Feeling Good" on [[I Put A Spell On You (album)|''I Put A Spell On You'']] (1965), "Lilac Wine" and "Wild Is the Wind" on ''[[Wild Is the Wind (album)|Wild is the Wind]]'' (1966).<ref>{{cite book |last=Hampton|title= A Musical Odyssey (David Nathan) in: Break Down And Let It All Out |pages= pp. 196-202}}</ref> 
Especially the songs "[[Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood]]", "[[Feeling Good]]" and "[[Sinnerman]]" (''[[Pastel Blues]]'', 1965) have great popularity today in terms of cover versions (most notably [[The Animals]]'s version of the former song), sample usage and its use on various movie-, TV-series- and videogame soundtracks.

Simone's years at RCA-Victor spawned a number of singles and album songs that were popular, particularly in Europe. In 1968 it was "[[Ain't Got No, I Got Life]]", a medley from the musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' from the album ''[[Nuff Said]]'' (1968) that became a surprise hit for Simone, reaching number 2 on the UK pop charts and introducing her to a younger audience.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hampton|title= Break Down And Let It All Out |pages= p. 47}}</ref> In 2006, it returned to the UK Top 30 in a remixed version by Groovefinder. The following single, [[Bee Gees|the Bee Gees']] "To Love Somebody" also reached the UK top 10 in 1969. "House of the Rising Sun" featured on ''[[Nina Simone Sings The Blues]]'' in 1967, but Simone had recorded the song earlier in 1961 (featuring on ''[[Nina At The Village Gate]]'', 1962), predating  versions by [[Dave Van Ronk]] and [[Bob Dylan]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://boscarol.com/nina/html/where/houseoftherising.html|title= Nina Simone Web: House of the Rising Sun|accessdate=2006-12-07 |author= Mauro Boscarol|format= |work= }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Hampton|title= A Musical Odyssey (David Nathan) in: Break Down And Let It All Out |pages= pp. 202-214}}</ref> It was later picked up by [[The Animals]] and became their signature hit.

==Personality, style and viewpoints==
===Performing style===
Simone's regal bearing and commanding stage presence earned her the title "High Priestess of Soul". Her live performances were regarded not as mere concerts, but as [[happening]]s. In a single concert she could be a singer, pianist, dancer, actress, activist, as well as both therapist and patient all simultaneously.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.high-priestess.com/biography.html|title= L'hommage: Nina Simone Biography|accessdate=2007-08-14 |author=|date= |year= |month= }}</ref> 
On stage Simone's versatility became truly evident, as she moved from gospel to blues, jazz and folk, to numbers infused with European classical styling, and [[counterpoint]] [[fugue]]s. She incorporated monologues and dialogues with the audience into the program, and often used silence as a musical element.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ninasimone.com/nina.html|title= Dr. Nina Simone: Biography|accessdate=2007-08-14 |author= Roger Nupie|date= |year= |month= }}</ref> Simone compared it to "mass hypnosis.

Many recordings exist of her concerts, expressing fragments of her on-stage power, wit, sensuality and occasional menace towards her audience. Throughout most of her live and recording career she was accompanied by [[percussionist]] Leopoldo Flemming and [[guitarist]] and musical director [[Al Schackman]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Simone|title= I Put a Spell on You |pages= pp. 58-59}}</ref>

===Being 'difficult'===
Simone had a reputation in the music industry for being volatile and sometimes difficult to deal with, a characterization with which she strenuously took issue. In [[1995]], she shot and wounded her neighbor's son with a [[BB gun|pneumatic pistol]] after his laughing disturbed her concentration.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2965225.stm|title= BBC Obituary: Nina Simone|accessdate=2006-12-07 |author= |date= 2003-04-21|year= 2003|month= April}}</ref> She also fired a gun at a record company executive whom she accused of stealing royalties.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/302438.stm|title= BBC Hard Talk: Putting Music First|accessdate=2006-12-07 |author= Tim Sebastian|date= 1999-03-25|year= 1999|month= March}}</ref> It is now recognised that this 'difficulty' was not just the result of an overly-perfectionist rigor, but her raging outbursts and diva-like extremes were actually the result of a psychiatric condition, most probably a [[bipolar disorder]] or [[borderline personality disorder]]. Simone reluctantly took medication for her condition from the mid sixties on.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hampton|title= Break Down And Let It All Out |pages= pp. 9-13}}</ref> All this was only known to a small group of intimates, and kept out of public view for many years, until the biography ''Break Down And Let It All Out'' written by Sylvia Hampton and David Nathan revealed this secret in 2004.

===Honors===
On Human Kindness Day 1974 in [[Washington DC]] more than 10,000 people paid tribute to Simone for her music and commitment to humanity.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hampton|title= Break Down And Let It All Out |pages= p. 85}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/04/24/AR2005042400984.html|title= Answer Man: Kindness Turned Brutality|accessdate=2007-01-05 |author= John Kelly}}</ref> 
Simone received two [[honorary degree]]s in music and humanities from the [[University of Massachusetts]] and [[Malcolm X College]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.inthesetimes.com/site/main/article/70/|title= Remembering Nina Simone|accessdate=2006-12-07 |author= Jody Kolodzey}}</ref> She preferred to be called "Dr. Nina Simone" after these honors were bestowed upon her.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.williams.edu/alumni/alumnireview/fall04/Signature.pdf |title= A Diva's Spell |accessdate=2006-12-07 |author= Eric Hanson|year= 2004|format= pdf |work= Williams Alumni Review|}}</ref> Only two days before her death, Simone was awarded with an honorary diploma by the [[Curtis Institute]], the school that had turned her down at the start of her career.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.theninasimonefoundation.org/content.php?page=biography|title= The Nina Simone Foundation|accessdate=2006-12-07 |format= |work= }}</ref> 

===Views on homosexuality===
Simone's fanbase and personal circle included a significant number of gay people. Her view on homosexuality can be described as ambivalent.<ref name=sexuality1>{{cite book |last=Hampton|title= Break Down And Let It All Out |pages= p. 76}}</ref> On the one hand her viewpoint was colored by her strict religious upbringing, opposing homosexuality. On the other hand, Simone was aware of widespread homosexuality within her fanbase and the entertainment industry.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hampton|title= Break Down And Let It All Out |pages= p. 48}}</ref> Many of the people close to her were homosexual, including her younger brother, [[Lorraine Hansberry]], the writers [[Langston Hughes]] and [[James Baldwin]], and the founders of her European fanclub, David Nathan and Sylvia Hampton. The latter two stated in their biography of Simone that she had no problem with homosexuals, as long as she did not have to hear about it explicitly <ref name=sexuality1/><ref>{{cite book |last=Hampton|title= Break Down And Let It All Out |pages= p. 124}}</ref>.

===On film===
The documentary ''Nina Simone: La Legende'' (''The Legend'') was made in the 90's by French filmakers.<ref name=legende/>
It was based on her autobiography ''I Put A Spell On You'' and features live footage from different periods of Nina's career, interviews with friends and family, various interviews with Nina herself while she was living in the [[Netherlands]], and on a trip to her birthplace. A significant amount of footage from ''The Legend'' was taken from an earlier 26-minute biographical documentary by Peter Rodis, released in 1969 and titled simply 'Nina'.

Plans for a Nina Simone [[biographical film]] were released at the end of 2005. The movie will be based on Nina Simone's autobiography ''I Put A Spell On You'' (1992) and will also focus on her relationship in later life with her assistant, Clifton Henderson, who died in 2006. TV writer Cynthia Mort (''[[Will & Grace]]'', ''[[Roseanne (TV series)|Roseanne]]'') is working on the [[Screenplay|script]], and singer Mary J. Blige will take on the lead role. The movie is scheduled for 2009.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0493076/ Untitled Nina Simone Project at IMDB.com]</ref>

In the film ''[[Point of No Return]],'' [[Bridget Fonda]]'s character, Maggie, plays Nina Simone records for comfort from her inner pain. A number of Simone songs are in the soundtrack. Her employer/captor (probably the [[CIA]]) gives her the [[codename]] "Nina": When she answers the phone and the caller calls her "Nina," she knows that it's time to do another [[assassin]]ation.
