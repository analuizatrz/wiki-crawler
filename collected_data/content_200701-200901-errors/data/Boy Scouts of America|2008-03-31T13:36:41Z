The '''Boy Scouts of America''' ('''BSA''') is the largest [[youth organization]] in the United States, having over five million members.<ref name="2006YIR" /><ref name="grolier">{{cite web |url=http://nbk.grolier.com/cgi-bin/article?assetid=a2003470-h |title=Boy Scouts |work=The New Book of Knowledge® |publisher=Grolier Online |accessdate =2008-02-24}}</ref> It was founded in 1910 as part of the [[Scouting|Scout Movement]] then developing internationally. It is believed that over one hundred million Americans have been members. Individual units of the BSA rely largely on volunteers; professionals are employed at higher levels of administration. The BSA is a member of the [[World Organization of the Scout Movement]].

The BSA arose amidst concerns of the [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive movement in the United States]] from people who sought to promote the [[social welfare]] of young men. The BSA seeks to train youth in what it considers to be responsible [[citizenship]], character development, and self-reliance through participation in a wide range of [[Wilderness|outdoor]] activities, educational programs, and, at older age levels, career&ndash;oriented programs in partnership with community organizations. For younger members, the [[Scout method]] is used to inculcate typical Scouting versions of values such as [[self-esteem]], personal [[Honour|honor]], citizenship, and outdoors skills through a variety of activities such as [[camping]], [[aquatics]] and [[hiking]].<ref name="vision">{{cite web | url =http://www.scouting.org/Legal/mission.aspx | title =Mission Statement and Vision Statement | format = | work = | publisher =Boy Scouts of America | accessdate =2006-10-10}}</ref><ref name="mbcom">{{cite web | url =http://www.meritbadge.com/info/aims.htm | title =Boy Scout Aims and Methods | format = | work = | publisher = Meritbadge.com | accessdate =2006-10-27}}</ref>

The BSA recognizes the achievements of its members through advancements in rank and special awards. It includes several membership divisions, targeted at boys ages six through seventeen and young men and women ages fourteen through twenty-one. The BSA operates locally, through volunteer-led units sponsored by churches, clubs, civic associations, educational organizations, and the like. Depending on age level, the units are generally known as troops, packs, or crews.

==Origins==
{{main|Scouting in the United States|History of the Boy Scouts of America}}
The [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive movement]] in the United States was at its height during the early twentieth century. With the migration of families from rural to urban centers, there were concerns among some people that young men were no longer learning patriotism and individualism. The [[YMCA]] was an early promoter of [[social welfare]] and other reforms involving young men. [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]] started [[Scouting]] in 1907 in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Social movement|movement]] began to grow overseas.<ref name="NT">{{cite journal |first=Jonny |last=Beardsall |title=Dib, dib, dib... One Hundred Years of Scouts at Brownsea |journal=[[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|The National Trust Magazine]] |year=2007 |issue=Spring 2007 |pages=pages 52-55}}</ref>

In 1909, Chicago publisher [[William D. Boyce|W. D. Boyce]] was visiting [[London]], [[England]] where he learned of the Scouting movement.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Peterson |first=Robert |year=2001 |url =http://www.scoutingmagazine.org/issues/0110/d-wwas.html |title=The Man Who Got Lost in the Fog |journal=[[Scouting (magazine)|''Scouting'']] |publisher =Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=2006-07-11}}</ref> Soon after his return to the U.S., Boyce incorporated the Boy Scouts of America on [[February 8]], [[1910]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Rowan |first=Edward L |year=2005 |title=To Do My Best: James E. West and the History of the Boy Scouts of America |publisher =Las Vegas International Scouting Museum |isbn=0-9746479-1-8 }}</ref> The YMCA became interested in the nascent BSA movement and provided support, enlisting [[Ernest Thompson Seton]] and [[Daniel Carter Beard]] who were both prominent leaders in the early youth movements. [[James E. West (Scouting)|James E. West]] became the first [[Chief Scout Executive]] and the Scouting movement began to expand in the U.S.

==Membership==
===Traditional membership===
In the BSA, Scouting is considered to be one movement with three main membership divisions:
*'''[[Cub Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Cub Scouting]]''' is the largest of the three divisions, available to boys from first&ndash;grade through fifth&ndash;grade or seven through ten years old and their families. It uses a challenging system to pursue the aims of character development, citizenship training, and personal fitness.<ref name="vision"/> Cub Scouting is divided into age-based levels of Tiger Cubs, Cub Scouts, and Webelos Scouts.
*'''[[Boy Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Boy Scouting]]''' is the [[wikt:flagship|flagship]] division of the BSA for boys ages ten to eighteen. It uses a system of outdoor activities to achieve the aims of Scouting. '''[[Varsity Scouts (Boy Scouts of America)|Varsity Scouting]]''' is modified Boy Scouting available to boys from fourteen through seventeen that adds a system of [[high adventure]] and sporting activities to appeal to the older boy, with an emphasis on team competition. The '''[[Order of the Arrow]]''' (OA) is the Boy Scout national honor society for experienced campers, based on [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]]<!--- American Indian is the preferred usage by the BSA. Read the linked article for a thorough discussion.---> traditions, and dedicated to the ideal of cheerful service and brotherhood.
*'''[[Venturing (Boy Scouts of America)|Venturing]]''' is the division for young men and women ages fourteen through twenty-one.<ref name="28-406">{{cite book|url=http://www.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/28-406.pdf |title=Boy Scouts of America Youth Application |id=#28-406B |accessdate=2008-03-10 |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |quote=Venturers and Sea Scouts registered in a crew or ship prior to their 21st birthday may continue as members after their 21st birthday until the crew or ship recharters or until they reach their 22nd birthday, whichever comes first.}}</ref> Its purpose is to provide positive experiences to help youth mature and to prepare them to become responsible adults.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.scouting.org/Media/FactSheets/02-388.aspx | title =What is Venturing |work =Fact Sheet | publisher =Boy Scouts of America | accessdate =2006-10-10}}</ref> '''[[Sea Scouts (Boy Scouts of America)|Sea Scouting]]''' is the nautical oriented part of this division.

There are about 100,000 physically or mentally disabled Scouts throughout the United States. Anyone certified as disabled "may enroll in Scouting and remain in its program beyond the regulation age limits. This provision allows all members to advance in Scouting as far as they wish."<ref name="grolier">&nbsp;</ref>

===Membership controversies===
{{details|Boy Scouts of America membership controversies}}
The Boy Scouts of America has been both criticized and supported for its restrictive membership policies, which prohibit participation by [[Atheism|atheists]], [[Agnosticism|agnostics]], and "known or avowed" [[homosexuality|homosexuals]], and limit participation by girls.<ref name="core">{{cite web |url=http://www.bsalegal.org/core-values-286.asp |work=BSALegal.org |title=Core Values |accessdate=2006-10-02}}</ref><ref name="duty">{{cite web |url=http://www.bsalegal.org/duty-to-god-cases-224.asp |work=BSALegal.org |title=Duty to God |accessdate=2006-10-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://atheism.about.com/b/a/258300.htm |title=Boy Scouts & Public Funding: Defending Bigotry as a Public Good |work=About.com |accessdate=2006-11-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bsa-discrimination.org/ |work=BSA Discrimination |title=Discrimination in the BSA |accessdate=2006-09-04}}</ref> The BSA contends that these policies are essential in its mission to instill in young people the [[values]] of the Scout Oath and Law.<ref name="core">{{cite web |url=http://www.bsalegal.org/core-values-286.asp |work=BSALegal.org |title=Core Values |accessdate=2006-10-02}}</ref><ref name="duty">{{cite web |url=http://www.bsalegal.org/duty-to-god-cases-224.asp|work=BSALegal.org |title=Duty to God |accessdate=2006-10-22}}</ref> The organization's legal right to have these policies has been upheld repeatedly by both [[state court|state]] and [[United States federal courts|federal courts]]. In recent years, these membership policies have led to litigation over the terms under which the BSA can access governmental resources including public lands.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2006/10/16/state/n075532D70.DTL |title=Supreme Court Won't Review Berkeley Sea Scouts' Case |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle via Associated Press |accessdate=2006-10-17}}</ref>

===Learning for Life===
[[Image:Learning for Life.svg|thumb|Learning for Life]]
[[Learning for Life]] is a school and work-site based program that is a subsidiary of the BSA. It utilizes programs designed for schools and community-based organizations that are designed to prepare youth to for the complexities of contemporary society and to enhance their self-confidence, motivation, and self-esteem.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.learning-for-life.org/ |title=Learning for Life - Exploring |publisher=Learning For Life |accessdate=2006-01-15}}</ref> [[Exploring (Learning for Life)|Exploring]] is the worksite-based program of Learning for Life, and focuses on involving teenagers in clubs, called posts, that allow young people to learn about possible careers, form friendships, develop leadership skills, and enjoy activities with like-minded teens and adults.<ref name= "lfl outside">{{cite web |url=http://www.bsa-discrimination.org/html/lfl.html |title=Learning For Life |publisher=BSA Discrimination |accessdate=2008-03-19}}</ref>

Learning for Life is not considered a traditional [[Scouting]] program; it does not use the [[Scout Promise]], [[Scout Law]], uniforms or insignia of traditional Scouting. All Learning for Life programs are open to youth and adults without restriction based on gender, residence, sexual orientation, or other considerations, other than minimum age requirements.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.learning-for-life.org/exploring/promos/99-993.pdf |title=What Is Exploring? |publisher=Learning For Life |accessdate=2008-03-19}}</ref><ref name= "lfl outside"/>

==Aims, methods and ideals==
[[Image:BSA 2006-2010 Strategic Plan.png|thumb|150px|<center>{{pad|2em}}BSA "Strategic Plan Identity" emblem</center>]]
The stated objectives of the BSA are referred to as "Aims of Scouting": character development, citizenship training, and personal fitness. The BSA pursues these aims through an informal education system called the [[Scout method]], with variations that are designed to be appropriate for the age and maturity of each membership division:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenbar.ws/4adults/theaims.cfm |title=The Aims of Scouting | work=Green Bar Web Site |accessdate=2008-03-06}}</ref><ref name="ldrtrng">{{cite web |url=http://www.scouting.org/BoyScouts/NewLeaderTraining/basic.aspx |title=Basic Leader Training |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=2008-03-04}}</ref>
* The methods of [[Cub Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Cub Scouting]] are ideals, the den, advancement, family involvement, activities, home and neighborhood centered and the uniform.
* The methods of [[Boy Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Boy Scouting]] are ideals, patrols, the outdoor program, advancement, association with adults, personal growth, leadership development and the uniform.
* The methods of [[Venturing (Boy Scouts of America)|Venturing]] are leadership, group activities, adult association, recognition, ideals, high adventure and teaching others.

[[:Category:Scouting ideals|Scouting ideals]] are codified for each membership division and include the Cub Scout Promise and the Law of the Pack, the [[Scout Promise|Scout Oath]] and the [[Scout Law]] and the Venturing Oath and Venturing Code.

==Organization==
===National Council===
The National Council is the corporate membership of the Boy Scouts of America and is [[Congressional charter|chartered]] by the [[United States Congress]] to operate the Scouting program. The National Council members include the elected National Executive Board, the regional executive committees, the local council representatives, members at large, and honorary members. The National program is directed by the National Executive Board and administered by the [[Chief Scout Executive]] using a staff of professional Scouters. The National Council is incorporated as a [[501(c)|501(c)(3)]] [[Non-profit organization]] and is funded from private donations, membership dues, corporate sponsors, and special events.

The BSA was granted a federal charter in 1916, now codified as 36 U.S.C. Chapter 309,<ref>{{usctc|36|309|}} Federal charter, Boy Scouts of America</ref> stating that their purpose is to:
<blockquote>"promote, through organization, and cooperation with other agencies, the ability of boys to do things for themselves and others, to train them in scoutcraft, and to teach them patriotism, courage, self-reliance, and kindred virtues, using the methods that were in common use by boy scouts on June 15, 1916."</blockquote>

The charter authorized and set standards for the incorporation of the Boy Scouts of America. A provision in the federal charter gives the BSA the "exclusive right to use emblems, badges, descriptive or designating marks, and words or phrases" that they adopt.

The BSA is governed by the National Executive Board and directed by the [[national president of the Boy Scouts of America|national president]], elected by representatives from the local councils.<ref name="bsaorg">{{cite web |last=Nelson |first=Bill |url=http://usscouts.org/aboutbsa/bsaorg.asp| title = Organization of the Boy Scouts of America |work=U.S. Scouting Service Project |accessdate=2008-03-12}}</ref> Board memberships include regular elected members, presidents, the Advisory Council chair and the chairman of the Board of Regents of the [[National Eagle Scout Association]]. The board may also include up to five appointed youth members. Professional Scouters of the National staff are nonvoting members.

The National Executive Board has five group standing committees: the Administration Group Committee, Program Group Committee, Human Resources Group Committee, Regional Presidents' Group Committee, and Relationships/Marketing Group Committee. Each of these committees is in turn directly responsible for a corresponding support group that provides administrative functions. Group committees may in turn be responsible for support standing committees and groups divided into divisions.

===Groups and divisions===
The Program Group is responsible for delivering the Scouting program and includes the Boy Scouting, Cub Scouting and Venturing Divisions. The Scoutreach Division emphasizes service to rural and urban areas and to minority populations; the name is a [[portmanteau]] combining ''Scout'' and ''outreach''. The African American Focus works with African American populations in partnerships with the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]], [[Alpha Phi Alpha]], [[Kappa Alpha Psi]], the [[NAACP]], African American Baptist churches and other groups. The Hispanic/Latino Focus includes the ¡Scouting – Vale La Pena! emphasis for Hispanic youth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scoutreachbsa.org/ |title=Scoutreach Division&ndash; BSA |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=2006-03-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scoutingvalelapena.org/ |title=Scouting - Vale La Pena |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=2006-03-13}}</ref> This includes Spanish language resources such as handbooks, training material and videos. The Soccer and Scouting emphasis is a partnership with the [[National Soccer Coaches Association of America]] to provide alternatives for Cub Scout age Hispanic youth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soccerandscouting.org/index.html |title=Soccer and Scouting |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=2007-02-17}}</ref> The Asian American Focus reaches out to Indo-Chinese American, Vietnamese American, Chinese American and Korean American communities. The Rural Scouting focus targets small communities and includes the [[American Indian Scouting Association]], a partnership with the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]].

[[Image:ToothofTime.JPG|thumb|Tooth of Time at Philmont Scout Ranch]]
The High Adventure Division administers [[Philmont Scout Ranch]], [[Northern Tier National High Adventure Bases]] and [[Florida National High Adventure Sea Base]].
The Jamboree Division provides support for the [[World Scout Jamboree|world]] and [[National Scout jamboree (Boy Scouts of America)|national]] jamborees. The International Division is responsible for relations with other Scout and Guide organizations; it includes the Interamerican Scout Foundation and [[Direct Service]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.interamfoundation.org/ |title=Interamerican Scout Foundation |publisher=Interamerican Scout Foundation |accessdate =2006-03-13}}</ref> The Relationships Division is responsible for relations with supporting organizations outside the BSA, including the [[AFL-CIO]], [[Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks|Elks]], [[Veterans of Foreign Wars|VFW]] and all religious associations and awards.

The National Supply Group is responsible for developing and selling uniforms, apparel, insignia, literature and equipment. It sells equipment and supplies through National Scout Shops, local council trading posts, authorized independent resellers and online at ScoutStuff.org.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scoutstuff.org |title=ScoutStuff.org |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=2006-03-13}}</ref> Supply Group also licenses trademarks for use by other commercial vensdors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bsalicensing.org |title=BSALicensing.org |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=2008-03-05}}</ref>

The Administrative Group comprises several divisions, such as the Finance Support Division, Human Resources Administration Division, Professional Development Division, Compensation and Benefits Division and Information Services Division that provide internal administrative service and support. The Marketing and Communications Division is part of the Administrative Group and is responsible for marketing the BSA program, which includes responsibility for most national websites. It also publishes two magazines: ''[[Scouting (magazine)|Scouting]]'' for adult leaders and ''[[Boys' Life]]'' for youth.

The National Scouting Museum is located in [[Irving, Texas]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bsamuseum.org/ |title=National Scouting Museum|publisher=National Scouting Museum |accessdate=2008-03-07}}</ref> Exhibits include [[Norman Rockwell]] paintings, high adventure sections, hands-on learning experiences, interactive exhibits, and a historical collection tracing uniforms, themes, and documents from the beginning of the Scouting movement in America. Among the museum's artifacts are the Eagle Scout medal of [[Arthur Rose Eldred]], the first [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]].<ref name="eaglescoutorg">{{cite web |url=http://www.eaglescout.org/history/first_eagle.html |title=BSA's first Eagle Scout |publisher=Eagle Scout Resource Center |accessdate=2006-07-07}}</ref>

===Regions and areas===
{{Infobox Awards |box_width= |halign=center |award1=[[Image:BSA Region Map.svg|200px]] |award2=Boy Scouts of America Regions as of 1992}}
For administrative purposes, the BSA is divided into four regions–Western, Central, Southern and Northeast.<ref name="bsaorg"/><ref>{{dmoz|Recreation/Scouting/Organizations/Boy_Scouts_of_America/Councils/|Boy Scouts of America: Councils}}</ref> Each region is subdivided into areas, about six per region.

Each region has a volunteer president, assisted by volunteer officers and board members, and the day-to-day work of Scouting is managed by the regional director, assistant and associate regional directors, and area directors. Regions and areas are subdivisions of the National Council and do not have a corporate status separate from the BSA.
*Central Region covers all of Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota, Ohio, Wisconsin, and parts of Indiana, Kentucky, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Virginia and West Virginia.
*Northeast Region covers all of Connecticut, District of Columbia, Delaware, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Puerto Rico, Transatlantic Council, and the Virgin Islands, and parts of Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nerbsa.org/ |title=Northeast Region, Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=2008-02-27}}</ref>
*Southern Region covers all of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Tennessee, and parts of Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://srbsa.org/ |title=Southern Region, Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=2008-02-27}}</ref>
*Western Region covers all of Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Wyoming, Far East Council and the Pacific Basin, and parts of Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota and Texas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrbsa.org/ |title=Western Region, Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=2008-02-27}}</ref>

===Local councils===
{{maincat|Local councils of the Boy Scouts of America}}
The BSA program is administered through 308 local councils, with each council covering a geopolitical area that may vary from a single city to an entire state. Councils receive an annual charter from the National Council and are usually incorporated as a charitable organization.<ref name="bsaorg"/>

The council level organization is similar to that of the National Council. The council executive board is headed by the council president and is made up of representatives from each chartered organization and annually elected members-at-large. The board establishes the council program and carries out the resolutions, policies, and activities of the council. Board members are registered volunteer Scouters and often work at the unit level. Youth members may be selected to the council executive board according to the council by-laws.

The Scout executive manages council operations—including finance, property management, advancement and awards, registrations and Scout Shop sales—with a staff of other professionals and para-professionals. [[Commissioner Service|Commissioners]] lead the unit service functions of the council, help maintain the standards of the BSA Scouts of America and assures a healthy unit program.
[[Image:Philly Scout.png|thumb|Bruce S. Marks Scout Resource Center]]

The BSA charters two councils for Scouts who live overseas, largely on military bases in Europe and Asia. The [[American Scouting overseas#Transatlantic Council|Transatlantic Council]], headquartered in Germany, serves BSA units in much of Europe, and the [[American Scouting overseas#Far East Council|Far East Council]], headquartered in Japan, serves units in the western Pacific areas. The [[American Scouting overseas#Direct Service|Direct Service]] branch makes the Scouting movement available to U.S. citizens and their dependents living in countries outside these jurisdictions or in isolated areas. The [[Scouting in Hawaii#Aloha Council|Aloha Council]] in Hawaii also serves BSA units in the American territories of [[American Samoa]], [[Guam]], the [[Northern Marianas Islands]] and in the sovereign countries of the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], the [[Marshall Islands]] and [[Palau]].

The Greater New York Councils are unique in that they are divided into five boroughs with each led by a borough Scout executive.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bsa-gnyc.org/openrosters/view_homepage.asp?orgkey=1161 |title=Greater New York Councils|publisher=Greater New York Councils-BSA |accessdate=2006-08-08}}</ref> Each borough is then divided into districts. Boroughs and districts are subdivisions of the local council and do not have a separate corporate status.

Councils are divided into districts with leadership provided by the district executive, district chairman, and the [[Commissioner Service|district commissioner]].<ref name="bsaorg"/> Districts are directly responsible for the operation of Scouting units and, except for the district executive, are mostly staffed with volunteers. The voting members of each district consist of volunteer representatives from each chartered organization having at least one BSA unit, plus annually elected members-at-large who in turn elect the district chairman.

===Units and chartered organizations===
The unit is the main operating group of the BSA.<ref name="bsaorg"/> A unit conducts Scouting for a chartered organization; it consists of registered youth members and registered adult volunteer members. Cub Scouts are organized as packs, Boy Scouts as troops, Varsity Scouts as teams, Venturers as crews, and Sea Scouts as ships.

Each unit is operated by a community-based organization such as a business, service organization, school organization, labor group, or religious institution that has applied for and received an annual charter from the BSA. The chartered organization is responsible for selecting leadership, providing a meeting place, and promoting a good program. The chartered organization representative is the manager of Scouting in a chartered organization and serves as a liaison between the unit, the chartered organization, and the BSA.

The unit is administered by a unit committee, which is appointed by the chartered organization. The unit committee, led by the committee chairman, overseea the unit program and activities and manages record keeping, finance, leadership recruitment and registration. The unit is led by a registered and trained leader– a Cubmaster, Scoutmaster, Coach, Advisor, or Skipper. These leaders, with one or more assistants, are appointed by the unit committee and must be approved by both the chartered organization and the local council.

==Finance==
In 2005, the BSA ranked as the twelfth-largest [[non-profit]] organization in the US, with total revenues of $665.9 million. As of January 2007, the American Institute of Philanthropy lists the Chief Scout Executive as having the fifth-highest compensation of any nonprofit chief in the United States, at $916,028.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.charitywatch.org/criteria.html#top20 |title=Top 25 compensation packages |work =American Institute of Philanthropy |accessdate=2008-03-12 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070116173244/http://www.charitywatch.org/criteria.html |archivedate=2007-01-16}}</ref> In 2005, the Chief Scout Executive's pay was 0.26% of total expenses, whereas the national average among charities stands at a higher 0.34%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm/bay/content.view/catid/68/cpid/304.htm |title=CEO compensation |work=Charity Navigator |accessdate =2006-02-06}}</ref> The Chief Scout Executive was honored in August 2005 as one of the top fifty most effective non-profit leaders by the ''Non-Profit Times''.

==Impact on American life==
[[Image:Norman Rockwell- Beyond the Easel.jpg|thumb|Norman Rockwell's ''Beyond the Easel'']]
Scouting and Boy Scouts are well known throughout [[United States|American]] [[Scouting in popular culture|culture]].

Famed American illustrator [[Norman Rockwell]]'s works were closely associated with the Boy Scouts of America for much of the 20th century.<ref name=Abrams>{{cite book | author = [[William Hillcourt]] |title=Norman Rockwell's World of Scouting |publisher = Harry N. Abrams |location=New York |year=1977 |isbn=0810915820}}</ref> Beginning in 1913, Rockwell began illustrating covers of ''[[Boys' Life]]'' magazine.

===Good Turns===
From the inception of the Scouting movement, Scouts have been urged to "Do a Good Turn Daily". The first national Good Turn was the promotion of a safe and sane [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] in 1913. Scouting for Food is an on-going annual program begun in 1986 that collects food for local [[food bank]]s.

In 1997, the BSA developed Service to America with a commitment to provide 200 million hours of service by youth members by the end of the year 2000. As part of Service to America, the BSA provided service projects in conjunction with the [[National Park Service]] (NPS). In October 2003, the [[Department of the Interior]] expanded the program with the creation of [[Take Pride in America]], opening service to all Americans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.takepride.gov/index.cfm |title =Take Pride in America |publisher=Department of the Interior |accessdate =2006-03-30}}</ref>

The BSA developed Good Turn for America in 2004 to address the problems of hunger, homelessness and inadequate housing and poor health in conjunction with the [[Salvation Army]], the [[American Red Cross]], [[Habitat for Humanity]] and other organizations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goodturnforamerica.org/ |title=Good Turn for America |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate =2006-03-30}}</ref>
