The '''Maserati MC12''' is a [[grand tourer]] produced by [[Maserati]] to allow a racing variant to compete in the [[FIA GT Championship]]. The car entered production in 2004 with 30 cars produced (five of which were not for sale). A further 25 were produced in 2005 making a total of 50 cars available for customers, each of which were pre-sold for [[Euro|€]]600&nbsp;000.<ref name="Maserati Indy" /><ref name="worldcarfans">{{web cite|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/features.cfm/featureID/1060609.001/country/ecf/maserati/wcf-test-drive-maserati-mc12r-by-edo|title=World Car Fans test drive MC12|accessdate=2006-09-28|publisher=World Car Fans|first=Nick|last=Hall}}</ref>

Maserati designed and built the car on the [[chassis]] of the [[Enzo Ferrari (car)|Enzo Ferrari]] but the final car is much larger.<ref name="worldcarfans" /> The MC12 is longer, wider and taller than the Enzo Ferrari, which has faster acceleration and a higher top speed. The top speed of the Maserati MC12 is 330 kilometres per hour (205&nbsp;mph) whereas the top speed of the Enzo Ferrari is 350 kilometres per hour (217.5&nbsp;mph).<ref name="worldcarfans" /><ref name="telegraph">{{web cite|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/main.jhtml?xml=/motoring/2005/04/16/mfmas16.xml|title=Telegraph: It costs how much?|accessdate=2006-10-06|publisher=Telegraph}}</ref>

The MC12 was developed to signal Maserati's return to racing after 37&nbsp;years.<ref name="rsportscars">{{web cite| url=http://www.rsportscars.com/eng/cars/maserati_mc12.asp| title=RSportsCars: Maserati MC12| accessdate=2006-09-29 | publisher=RSportsCars}}</ref> The road version was produced to [[homologate]] the race version. One requirement for participation in the FIA GT is the production of at least 25 road cars. Three GT1 [[race car]]s were entered into the FIA GT with great success. Maserati began racing the MC12 in the FIA GT toward the end of the 2004 season, winning the [[Zhuhai International Circuit]]. The racing MC12s were entered into the [[American Le Mans Series]] races in 2005 but exceeded the size restrictions and consequently paid weight penalties.

==Development==

Development of the Maserati MC12 began while Maserati was owned by [[Ferrari]] in order to create a race car for Maserati that would be eligible to compete in the [[FIA GT]]. Its initial name was the ''MCC'', meaning ''Maserati Corse Competizione'', and development under the direction of Giorgio Ascanelli was planned to be simultaneous with that of the ''MCS'', a similar alternative.<ref name="maseratinet" /> The body shape was developed from an idea by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] during wind tunnel testing, though the majority of styling was by [[Frank Stephenson]].<ref name="coolsupercars">{{web cite|url=http://www.coolsupercars.com/maserati-mc-12/|title=Maserati MC12|publisher=Cool Supercars|accessdate=2006-12-02|date=2006-11-26}}</ref> The MCC had a very similar body shape to the MC12 but there were several key differences, most notably the rear [[Spoiler (automotive)|spoiler]].<ref name="maseratinet" /> [[Andrea Bertolini]] was the chief test driver throughout the development(although much of the work was done by Michael Schumacher), frequently testing the MCC at the [[Fiorano Circuit]].<ref name="maseratinet" /> As the MCC was developed further, word of the MCS ceased and eventually the final name, MC12, was announced.<ref name="maseratinet" />

The car is based heavily on the [[Enzo Ferrari (car)|Enzo Ferrari]], sharing the same [[Ferrari Dino engine#V12|Ferrari Dino V12]] engine with slight modifications, the same [[gearbox]] (but renaming it ''Maserati Cambiocorsa'') and the same [[chassis]] and track (length of [[axle]] between the wheels).<ref name="worldcarfans" /> The Maserati MC12 has its own bodywork which is wider, longer and slightly taller leaving the windshield as the only externally visible component shared with the Enzo.<ref name="Motor Trend" /> This extra size allows for greater [[downforce]] across the whole body, adding to that of the two metre [[Spoiler (automotive)|spoiler]].

==Overview==
[[Image:MC12 blue.JPG|thumb|220px|right|An MC12 that has been re-painted blue]]
The MC12 is a two-door [[coupe]] with a [[targa top]] roof, although the detached roof cannot be stored in the car.<ref name="Motor Trend" /> The [[RMR layout|mid-rear layout]] (engine between the axles but behind the cabin) keeps the [[centre of gravity]] in the middle of the car, which increases stability and improves the car's cornering ability. The standing [[weight distribution]] is 41% front: 59% rear; at speed however, the downforce provided by the rear spoiler affects this such that at 200&nbsp;kilometres per hour (125&nbsp;mph), the effective weight distribution is 34% front: 66% rear.<ref name="Motor Trend" />

===Interior===
Even though the car is designed as a [[homologation]] vehicle and is a modification of a racing car, the interior is intended to be luxurious. The interior is a mix of gel-coated [[Carbon fiber reinforced plastic|carbon fibre]], blue leather and silver "Brightex": a synthetic material which was found to be "too expensive for the fashion industry."<ref name="telegraph" /> The centre console features the characteristic Maserati oval [[Clock#Analog clocks|analogue clock]] and a blue ignition button, but it has been criticised for lacking a [[radio]], [[car stereo]] or a place to install an [[Aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]] sound system.<ref name="coolsupercars" /><ref name="Fifth Gear">{{cite video|people=Frank Mountain|title=[[Fifth Gear]]: Maserati MC12|medium=Tv Series|publisher=[[Five (TV)|Five]]|location=[[Cadwell Park]]|date=2004}}</ref>

===Exterior===
The body of the car, made entirely of carbon fibre, has undergone extensive [[wind tunnel]] testing to achieve maximum downforce across all surfaces. As a result, the rear spoiler is two metres (79&nbsp;in) wide but only 30&nbsp;millimetres (1.2&nbsp;in) thick, the underside of the car is smooth, and the rear bumper has [[diffuser (automotive)|diffusers]] to take advantage of [[ground effect in cars|ground effect]].<ref name="Maserati Indy" /> Air is sucked into the engine compartment through the [[Cold air intake|air scoop]]; its positioning on top of the cabin makes the car taller than the Enzo. The exterior is available only in the white and blue colour scheme, a tribute to the [[America Camoradi]] racing team that drove the [[Maserati Tipo 61|Maserati Tipo Birdcages]] in the early 1960s.<ref name="rsportscars"/><ref name="Road and Track">{{web cite|url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/article.asp?section_id=3&article_id=2165&page_number=1|title=Road and Track road tests: MC12|accessdate=2006-10-02|publisher=Road and Track}}</ref> The car is noted for the awkwardness that results from its size: very long and wider than a [[Hummer H2]].<ref name="Fifth Gear" /> This, combined with the lack of a rear window, makes parking the MC12 very difficult.<ref name="Fifth Gear" />

===Engine===
The MC12 sports a 232&nbsp;kilogram (511&nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|lb]]), six-litre (5,998&nbsp;cc<!-- It's actually correct to use cc when refering to car engines per the Wikiproject Automobiles standards -->/366&nbsp;cu&nbsp;in) [[Ferrari Dino engine#V12|Enzo Ferrari-derived]] [[V12]] engine, mounted at 65°.<ref>{{web cite|url=http://www.vitaphone-racing.de/en/racing-facts/technik/mc12-rennversion.html|title=Technical Characteristics|publisher=[[Vitaphone Racing]]|accessdate=2006-12-03}}</ref> Each [[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] has four [[Poppet valve|valves]], lubricated via a [[dry sump]] system, and a [[compression ratio]] of 11.2:1.<ref name="global" /> These combine to provide a maximum [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]] of 652&nbsp;[[newton metre]]s (481&nbsp;[[lbf·ft]]) at 5500&nbsp;rpm and a maximum [[Power (physics)|power]] of 465&nbsp;[[kilowatt]]s (632&nbsp;[[Horsepower#PS|PS]]/621&nbsp;[[Horsepower|bhp]]) at 7500&nbsp;[[rpm]].<ref name="global" /> The [[redline]] rpm is indicated at 7500&mdash;despite being safe up to 7700&mdash;whereas the Enzo has redline at 8200&nbsp;rpm.<ref name="Motor Trend" />

The Maserati MC12 can accelerate from 0&ndash;100&nbsp;[[km/h|kilometres per hour]] (62&nbsp;[[mph]]) in 3.8&nbsp;seconds (though ''[[Motor Trend|Motor Trend Magazine]]'' managed 3.7&nbsp;seconds) and on to 200&nbsp;kilometres per hour (125&nbsp;mph) in 9.9&nbsp;seconds.<ref name="Motor Trend" /><ref name="carfolio" /><ref name="Maserati Indy" /> It can complete a standing (from stationary) [[quarter mile]] in 11.3&nbsp;seconds with a terminal speed of 200&nbsp;kilometres per hour (125&nbsp;mph) or a standing kilometre in 20.1&nbsp;seconds.<ref name="Motor Trend" /><ref name="carfolio" /> The maximum speed of the Maserati MC12 is 330&nbsp;kilometres per hour (205&nbsp;mph).<ref name="carfolio" />

The power is fed to the wheels through a rear-mounted, six-speed [[semi-automatic transmission]]. The gearbox is the same as the Enzo's transmission (tuned to different [[gear ratio]]s) but renamed "Maserati Cambiocorsa". It provides a [[shift time]] of just 150&nbsp;milliseconds, and is mechanical with a 215&nbsp;millimetre (8.5&nbsp;in) twin plate [[dry clutch]].<ref name="Maserati Indy" /><ref name="worldcarfans" /><ref>{{web cite|url=http://paultan.org/archives/2006/06/26/vw-phases-out-automatics-makes-way-for-dsg/|title=VW phases out automatics|publisher=Paul Tan|first=Paul|last=Tan|accessdate=2006-12-02}}</ref>

===Chassis===
[[Image:Maserati MC12 2-cropped.jpg|thumb|right|300px|An MC12 at the [[Mondial de l'Automobile 2004|2004 Paris Motor Show]]]]
The MC12’s [[chassis]] is a [[Monocoque#Automobiles|monocoque]] made of [[carbon]] and [[nomex]], with an [[aluminium]] sub-chassis at the front and rear. It has a [[roll bar]] to provide additional strength, comfort and safety.<ref name="Motor Trend" /><ref name="rsportscars" /> [[Double wishbone suspension]] with push-rod-operated [[coil spring]]s provide stability and [[shock absorber|dampers]] smooth the ride for the passengers.<ref name="supercars">{{web cite|url=http://www.supercars.net/cars/2919.html|title=Maserati MC12|publisher=supercars.net|accessdate=2006-12-02}}</ref> The front of the car can be raised for speed bumps and hills by pressing a button that extends the front suspension.<ref name="coolsupercars" /> There are two modes for the chassis' tuning which can also be changed with a button in the cabin: ''Sport'', the standard setting, and ''Race'', which features less of the ''[[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] ASR'' (Anti-Slip Regulation) [[traction control]], faster shifts and stiffer suspension.<ref name="Maserati Indy" /><ref>{{web cite|url=http://www.fiagt.com/cars.php?car=MC%2012|title=Cars: Maserati MC12|publisher=[[FIA GT]]|accessdate=2006-12-03}}</ref>

===Wheels===
The MC12 has 480&nbsp;millimetre (19&nbsp;in) wheels with a width of 230&nbsp;millimetres (9&nbsp;in) at the front and 330&nbsp;millimetres (13&nbsp;in) at the rear. The [[Tire|tyres]] are ''[[Pirelli]] P Zero Corsas'' with [[tire code|codes]] of 245/35&nbsp;ZR&nbsp;19 for the front tyres and 345/35&nbsp;ZR&nbsp;19 for the rear.<ref name="Road and Track" /> The brakes are [[Brembo]] [[disc brakes]] with a Bosch [[anti-lock braking system]] (ABS).<ref name="supercars" /> The front brakes have a diameter of 380&nbsp;millimetres (15&nbsp;in) with six-piston [[Disc brake#Calipers|calipers]] and the rear brakes have a diameter of 335&nbsp;millimetres (13.2&nbsp;in) with four-piston calipers.<ref name="supercars" /> The centre-lock wheel [[Nut (hardware)|nuts]] that hold the wheels to the chassis are colour coded: red on the left of the car, blue on the right.<ref name="Motor Trend" />

==Reception==
The car has generally received positive reviews, but its critics say it is hard to drive, overpriced and too large.<ref name="top gear">{{cite video|people=[[Jeremy Clarkson]], [[Richard Hammond]]|title=[[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]]: Maserati MC12|medium=Tv Series|publisher=[[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]]|location=Top Gear Test Track|date=2005 }}</ref> Other criticisms include the lack of a [[Trunk (automobile)|boot]], rear window, spare tyre and radio, and the way the car's engine was limited or "drugged".<ref name="Motor Trend" /><ref name="worldcarfans" /> Current driver for [[Vitaphone Racing]] Team [[Andrea Bertolini]], the chief test driver throughout the [[Automotive design|development]], said the car "reacts well and is very reliable in its reactions".<ref>{{web cite|url=http://www.maseraticorse.com/home.php?lang=eng&menuid=04010002&idsitm=CN|accessdate=2006-10-28|title=Interview With Andrea Bertolini|publisher=Maserati Corse}}</ref>

The ''[[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]]'' television series acquired an MC12, and test driver [[The Stig]] achieved a lap time of 1:18.9 around the ''Top Gear'' track&mdash;0.1&nbsp;seconds faster than his lap in the Enzo Ferrari.<ref>{{web cite|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/topgear/powerlaps.shtml
|title=Top Gear Power Laps|accessdate=2006-09-29|publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref> Host [[Jeremy Clarkson]] also drove it, comparing it to the [[Maserati Biturbo]], a car he disliked.<ref name="top gear" /> Clarkson criticised the car heavily, pointing out that, like the [[Enzo]], it lacks a rear window. He also commented that it is "difficult" due to its size, and "one of the twitchiest cars" he has ever driven, meaning a small action by the driver results in an exaggerated reaction from the car.<ref name="top gear" /> Regarding the design of a racing car and modification to road standards he said, "Is it a racer? Is it a GT car? Is it a de-tuned Enzo in a fat suit? You can't really tell."<ref name="top gear" /> Despite his criticisms he did compliment the smooth ride:
{{cquotetxt|This car glides over bumps, the suspension absorbing the roadworker Johnnies’ laziness without transferring a single ripple to the cool blue interior with its Milanese fashion house upholstery.<ref>{{web cite|url=http://driving.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,12529-1500199_1,00.html|title=Maserati MC12|publisher= [[The Times]]|first=Jeremy|last=Clarkson|authorlink=Jeremy Clarkson|accessdate=2006-11-20}}</ref>}}

''[[Motor Trend Magazine]]'' reviewer Frank Markus had a more positive opinion. Despite initial skepticism he said, "It turns out that the Enzo makes a more comfortable and attractive road car when made over as a butch Maserati racer in street couture".<ref name="Motor Trend" /> Markus complimented the stability of braking and the handling ability of the MC12, especially the drifting allowed by the traction control when cornering, commenting that "There's none of the knife-edged limit handling we criticised in the more extreme Enzo. It's even more forgiving at the limit than an [[Acura NSX]]."<ref name="Motor Trend" />

When ''[[Automobile Magazine]]'' tested an MC12, reviewer Preston Lerner called it "user-friendly", praising the responsiveness and simplicity of driving.<ref name="automag">{{web cite|url=http://www.automobilemag.com/reviews/coupes/0506_maserati_mc12/performance.html|title=2005 MC12|publisher=Automobile Mag|accessdate=2006-11-07|first=Preston|last=Lerner}}</ref> Lerner approved of [[Frank Stephenson]]'s work with the styling of both the car's exterior and interior, calling the trim "Speed-Racer-ish" but "without looking as though it belongs in a Nitrous-ized Civic".<ref name="automag" /> He also complimented the ASR's level of intervention, commenting that it "lets the fun factor get reasonably high before kicking in".<ref name="automag" />

In 2004 Maserati completed three MC12 GT1 [[race car]]s intended for the [[FIA GT]] GT1 class.<ref>{{web cite|url=http://www.maseratinet.com/MCI/mc12_news.asp|title=Maserati Net: 25 road going MC12s delivered|accessdate=2006-09-29|publisher=Maserati Net}}</ref> The AF Corse factory-backed squad debuted the race at [[Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari|Imola]], yet the FIA did not allow the MC12 to score points due to its debated homologation. Even with this setback, the team managed to take second and third places. At the next round at [[Motopark Oschersleben|Oschersleben]], the MC12 of [[Andrea Bertolini]] and [[Mika Salo]] won for the first time. At the final round of the year at [[Zhuhai International Circuit|Zhuhai]], the FIA finally agreed to homologate the MC12s and allow them to score points towards the championship. With this, the MC12 again took victory, allowing it to score enough points to finish 7th in the teams championship.<ref name="Maserati Corse">{{web cite|url=http://www.maseraticorse.it/home.php?lang=eng&menuid=020114&seas=04|title=FIA GT Standings of 2004|accessdate=2006-09-29|publisher=Maserati Corse}}</ref><ref>{{web cite|url=http://www.crash.net/feature_view~t~Dubai-2004--Gardel-wins-with-drive-of-his-life-~cid~8~id~6128.htm|title=FIA GT Dubai 2004|publisher=crash.net|accessdate=2006-10-29}}</ref>

In 2005 Maserati won the FIA GT Manufacturers Cup with 239&nbsp;points: almost double the score of next team ([[Ferrari]] with 125&nbsp;points).<ref name="maserati corse">{{web cite|url=http://www.maseraticorse.it/home.php?lang=eng&menuid=020116&seas=05|title=FIA GT Standings of 2005|accessdate=2006-09-29|publisher=Maserati Corse}}</ref> The two teams that entered MC12s into the FIA GT, [[Vitaphone Racing]] and JMB Racing, finished first and second respectively in the Team Cup, with Vitaphone winning by a considerable margin.<ref name="maserati corse" /> Four of the MC12 drivers were in the running to win the FIA GT Drivers' Title at the [[Bahrain International Circuit]] at the start of the final race of 2005: [[Karl Wendlinger]] and [[Andrea Bertolini]] each on 71&nbsp;points and [[Timo Scheider]] and [[Michael Bartels]] on 70. Gabriele Gardel of Ferrari was also on 70&nbsp;points, however, and in the crucial race he placed ahead of the all of the Maseratis, driving an older [[Ferrari 550 Maranello]]. Gardel took the title leaving all of the Maserati drivers within four points of first place (Scheider and Wendlinger receiving four points for the race).<ref name="maserati corse" /><ref>{{web cite|url=http://luxurycar.atw.hu/maserati/maserati_mc12.html|title=MC12|publisher=Luxury Cars|accessdate=2006-10-26}}</ref>

In 2006 the only team representing Maserati was Vitaphone Racing. On [[October 1]], [[2006]] Vitaphone secured victory for the [[2006 FIA GT Championship season|2006 season]] despite their drivers placing 5th and 7th, with weight penalties of 85&nbsp;kilograms and 105&nbsp;kilograms respectively.<ref name="FIA GT news">{{web cite|url=http://www.fiagt.com/newsitem.php?key=1108|title=FIA GT News: GT1 Teams title for Vitaphone Racing|publisher=[[FIA GT]]|accessdate=2006-10-06}}</ref> Vitaphone gained enough points to be "out of reach" of their nearest rival, [[Aston Martin]] Racing [[Scuderia Italia|BMS]] (who race the [[Aston Martin DBR9|DBR9]]). According to Vitaphone Sporting Director Rafael Calafell, the goal of Vitaphone Racing is now to win the Drivers' title.<ref name="FIA GT news" />

===Italian GT===
MC12s have had great success racing in Italy, and have replaced the GT3 "Maserati Trofeo Light" as Maserati's representative in the Italian GT series.<ref>{{web cite|url=http://www.maseraticorse.it/home.php?lang=eng&menuid=0202010401&idsitm=CN&idrace=020201|title=Maserati Trofeo 'Light'|publisher=Maserati Corse|accessdate=2006-10-25}}</ref> In 2005 Maserati introduced two MC12s to the GT1 division under Scuderia Playteam and Racing Box, with the teams placing first and third overall respectively.<ref name="corse italian GT">{{web cite|url=http://www.maseraticorse.it/home.php?lang=eng&menuid=020205&seas=05|title=Italian GT Standings 2005|publisher=Maserati Corse|accessdate=2006-10-25}}</ref> The cars were re-entered in 2006, with Scuderia Playteam again securing overall victory and Racing Box coming second.<ref>{{web cite|url=http://www.maserati.com.au/default.asp?action=article&ID=267|title=Maserati 1-2 gives Maserati 1-2 World Titles|publisher=[[Maserati]]|accessdate=2006-11-05}}</ref><ref name="corse italian GT 2006">{{web cite|url=http://www.maseraticorse.it/home.php?lang=eng&menuid=020216&seas=06|title=Italian GT Standings 2006|publisher=Maserati Corse|accessdate=2006-10-25}}</ref><ref>{{web cite|url=http://www.imca-slotracing.com/2006%20ITALIAN%20GT%20CHAMPIONSHIP.htm|title=2006 Italian GT Championship|publisher=IMCA Slotracing|accessdate=2006-11-05}}</ref> From 2007, GT1 cars are not permitted in the championship, and Scuderia Playteam moved to the FIA GT Championship.

===Super GT===
In 2006, the [[24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]] winning outfit Team Goh was intending to race a Maserati MC12 in the [[Super GT]] series in [[Japan]]. However, the team was forced to withdraw because of driver problems ([[Jan Magnussen]] falling ill suddenly and returning to [[Denmark]]) and disappointing lap times at the [[Suzuka Circuit]] during testing.<ref>{{web cite|url=http://supergt.net/supergt/2006/06r01/0601test2_en.shtm|title=Round 1 Test|publisher=super GT|accessdate=2006-11-07}}</ref> While the car was faster than its Super GT rivals down the straights, it was losing more than a second per lap in the corners due to its poorer aerodynamics.<ref>{{web cite|url=http://supergt.net/supergt/2006/06r01/0601test1_en.shtm|title=Round 1 Official Test|publisher=Super GT|accessdate=2006-11-10}}</ref>

===American Le Mans Series===
[[Image:35 Maserati MC12.jpg|thumb|200px|The Maserati Corse MC12 GT1 at [[Road Atlanta]] in 2005.]]
[[Image:Doran Maserati.jpg|thumb|200px|Doran Racing's MC12 GT1 at [[Road America]] in 2007.]]
In 2004 the Maserati MC12s were unable to compete in series backed by the [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest|ACO]], such as the [[Le Mans Endurance Series]] (LMES) in Europe and the [[American Le Mans Series]] (ALMS) because they exceeded both the length and width restrictions for their class.<ref name="Motor Trend" /> The car's nose was shortened by 200&nbsp;millimetres (7.9&nbsp;in) to attempt to comply with regulations, but was still 66&nbsp;millimetres (2.6&nbsp;in) too wide. In 2005 the governing body of the ALMS, the [[International Motor Sports Association]] (IMSA), allowed the MC12s to compete as a guest with the agreement that they were not allowed to score championship points and were forced to run a weight penalty.<ref name="Road and Track" /> Some ALMS teams initially objected to the participation of the MC12 due to the possibility that an accident could eliminate their chances at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], but the MC12 was finally allowed to race. However the ACO stood by their ruling on the car by forbidding it from entering Le Mans.

The [[2005 American Le Mans Series season]] was not as successful for Maserati as the previous FIA GT season, with the team scoring no wins. In the final race at [[Laguna Seca]], the MC12 was clipped by a competitor, causing damage that resulted in a lengthy [[pit stop]].<ref name="Laguna Seca">{{web cite|url=http://www.maseraticorse.it/home.php?lang=eng&menuid=0204010410&idsitm=CN&idrace=020410|title=Unlucky Race for MC12 at Laguna Seca|publisher=Maserati Corse|accessdate=2006-10-25}}</ref> After resuming the race, a loss of traction caused by cold tyres made the car hit a kerb, which broke the [[radiator]] and took the MC12 out of the race.<ref name="Laguna Seca" />

In August [[2007]], [[Fredy Lienhard]] and [[Didier Theys]] announced their preparation of a former FIA GT MC12 for use in the American Le Mans Series.<ref name="Doran" /> The car made its debut at [[Road America]], finishing 3rd in the GT1 class after qualifying competitively.  It will run the rest of the season for the team [[Doran Racing]]. The team has selected [[Michelin]] tires instead of the [[Pirelli]]s originally used by Maserati Corse in 2005.<ref name="Doran">{{web cite|url=http://www.the-paddock.net/content/view/241885/49/|title=Doran Racing to Enter Maserati for Lienhard and Theys at Road America|date=01-08-2007|accessdate=2007-08-06|publisher=The Paddock}}</ref>

The '''Maserati MC12 Corsa''' is a derivative of the MC12, designed as a race car although driven by private owners. It was developed directly from the MC12 GT1, which won the 2005 FIA GT Manufacturers Cup.<ref name="maserati ultimate">{{web cite|url=http://www.maserati.com.au/default.asp?action=article&ID=248&KeyWords=Italian%2CGT|title=Maserati Launches its Ultimate Super car|publisher=[[Maserati]]|accessdate=2006-10-29}}</ref> The MC12 Corsa was developed in mid-2006 "in response to the customer demand to own the MC12 racing car and fuelled by the growth in track days, where owners can drive their cars at high speeds in the safety of a race track", as stated by Edward Butler, General Manager for Maserati in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].<ref name="RSportsCars">{{web cite|url=http://www.rsportscars.com/eng/cars/mc12_corsa.asp|title=RSportsCars: Maserati MC12 Corsa|accessdate=2006-09-28|publisher=RSportsCars}}</ref><ref name="maserati ultimate" /> Maserati is responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of the cars, and they are only driven on specially organised "track days" because they are not homologated for street use or any other competitions.  However, there is one Corsa which has been modified to make it road legal.<ref name="maserati ultimate" />

[[Image:Maserati_MC12_Corsa.jpg|thumb|left|Maserati MC 12 Corsa at the IAA 2007]]
The MC12 Corsa cost €1&nbsp;million (US$1.47&nbsp;million) and only twelve were sold to selected customers to participate in the "day races" organised by Maserati. Another three cars were produced for testing and publicity.<ref name="ultimatecarpage" /><ref name="RSportsCars" /> The engine is the same as the MC12 GT1 producing 555&nbsp;kilowatts (755&nbsp;PS/744&nbsp;bhp) at 8000&nbsp;rpm, 90&nbsp;kilowatts (122&nbsp;PS/121&nbsp;bhp) more than the MC12.<ref name="Autobild">{{web cite|url=http://www.autobild.de/aktuell/meldungen/artikel.php?artikel_id=11654|title=Vorstellung Maserati MC12 Corsa |publisher=Autobild|accessdate=2007-04-28}}</ref> It has the shortened nose that allowed the MC12 GT1 to compete in the American Le Mans Series. The MC12 Corsa is available in the "Blue Victory" colour as standard, but is customisable upon request.<ref name="RSportsCars" /> While the brakes are steel/carbon racing brakes, the MC12 Corsa does not have [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]].<ref name="maserati ultimate" />

The MC12 Corsa has been compared to the [[Ferrari FXX]] because it is a race car closely related to another car, is not street legal, is only used on track days and is kept by the manufacturer. The Ferrari FXX is used for testing technologies and recording statistics whereas the MC12 Corsa is only for racing.<ref name="IGN Corsa" />
