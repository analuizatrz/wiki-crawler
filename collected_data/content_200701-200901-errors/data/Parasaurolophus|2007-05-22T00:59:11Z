'''''Parasaurolophus''''' was a genus of [[hadrosaurid]] (duck-billed) [[dinosaur]] from the Upper [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|Period]] (about 76-65 million years ago) of what is now [[North America]]. Its name means 'near crested lizard', which refers to another hadrosaurid, ''[[Saurolophus]]'', discovered before ''Parasaurolophus''. Three species are currently recognised.

==Description==
''Parasaurolophus'' were about 10&nbsp;m (33&nbsp;ft) long, 5&nbsp;m (16&nbsp;ft) high and weighed around 3500&nbsp;kg (7,700&nbsp;lb). Like other hadrosaurs, they were facultatively [[bipedal]], i.e. they could alternate between two legs and four, probably preferring a [[quadrupedal]] gait while they foraged for food and assuming a bipedal mode for faster running.

Their most noticeable feature would have been the six-foot long curved crest, protruding from the rear of the head, often longer in males than in females. This hollow crest was probably used for intraspecific communication by both males and females and for display by the males. In the vertebrae there was a cut where the horn would hit the back, this prevented the horn from hitting the back. Many scientists also think the crest gave ''Parasaurolophus'' an excellent sense of smell. Other notable speculation is that the crest may be a defense mechanism of some sort, such as the modern day Bombardier Beatle's ability to throw a jet of chemical "fire" at their enemies.{{check}} ''Parasaurolophus'' is often depicted with a flap of skin running from the bottom of the crest to the base of the neck, though there is no evidence of this. There were about three species but two of them are known only by incomplete remains. The best known species is ''Parasaurolophus walkeri''.

==Discovery and species==
{{Expand|date=March 2007}}
Fossils of ''Parasaurolophus'' have been found across [[North America]], including much of a skeleton in [[Alberta]], [[Canada]], and partial skulls in [[New Mexico]], [[USA]].

==Paleobiology==
''Parasaurolophus'' probably lived in large herds and inhabited flood plains. They were [[herbivores]] but they were not, as was once thought, aquatic. They were fully terrestrial animals, as evidenced by footprints. They could possibly swim but they lived their entire lives on land. ''Parasaurolophus'' may have been prey for large [[carnivorous]] [[theropod]]s, such as ''[[Daspletosaurus]]''.
==In popular culture==

* The character "[[Ducky (The Land Before Time)|Ducky]]" from ''[[The Land Before Time]]'' is identified as a ''Parasaurolophus'', though she more closely resembles its relative ''[[Saurolophus]]''.
* ''Parasaurolophus'' appeared in all three ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' films. During the ''[[Brachiosaurus]]'' scene in the first film, when the camera trails to a full view of the park, a herd is seen near the lake. ''Parasaurolophus'' appeared again in ''[[The Lost World: Jurassic Park]]'' when [[InGen]] tries to capture [[dinosaur]]s for the [[San Diego]] [[Jurassic Park]]. This dinosaur appears again in ''[[Jurassic Park III]]''. The people on the island run into a herd of ''Parasaurolophus'' and ''[[Corythosaurus]]'' to escape ''[[Velociraptor]]''. ''Parasaurolophus'' was also featured in the [[Vivendi Universal]] game'' [[Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis]]''.
* ''Parasaurolophus'' was featured in various moments of Disney's [[Dinosaur (film)|Dinosaur]] and in the much older ''[[Rite of Spring]]'' sequence of ''[[Fantasia (film)|Fantasia]].'' featured ''Parasaurolophus'', with a flap of skin under the crest.
* ''Parasaurolophus'' also appeared in Episode 6 of ITV's documentary series [[Prehistoric Park]].
* ''Parasaurolophus'' appeared as a dinozord (Parazord) in [[Power Rangers: Dino Thunder]] and in the Japanese [[Super Sentai]] program [[Bakuryuu Sentai Abaranger]] which Power Rangers Dino Thunder was based on.
* ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' featured a race called the Voth, who evolved from ''Parasaurolophus'' and  left Earth when they developed space technology (see "[[Distant Origin (Voyager episode)|Distant Origin]]").
* Likewise, the ''[[Star Wars]]'' universe depicts a parasaurolophus-like species called the [[List of Star Wars races (U-Z)#Vurk|Vurk]], the species to which [[Jedi Master]] [[List of minor Star Wars Jedi masters#Trebor, Coleman|Coleman Trebor]] belongs to.
