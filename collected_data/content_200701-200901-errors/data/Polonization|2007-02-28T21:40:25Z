ISBN 985-417-345-1. Pp.24, 28.), an additional distinction between the Polonization ({{lang-pl|polonizacja}}) and self-Polonization ({{lang-pl|polszczenie się}}) has been being made, however, most modern Polish researchers don't use the term 'polszczenie się'.</ref> is the acquisition or imposition of elements of [[Polish culture]], especially the [[Polish language]], experienced by the non-Polish population of the territories controlled by Poland or with a significant Polish influence, in different historical periods. Polonization, one of [[cultural assimilation]]s, is often compared to other [[assimilation (sociology)|assimilationist]] policies carried out at times by other European powers that aspired to the regional domination (e.g. [[Germanization]], [[Rumanization]] or [[Russification]]), or to policies carried out by reconstituted countries which wanted to increase the role of their language in their societies (eg. [[Ukrainization]]). 

Polonization was especially noted in the history of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] (1569-1795) and the [[Second Polish Republic]] (1918-1939), although it must be noted that because of strong differences between these two widely separated historical periods, the process of Polonization was quite different in each. In the times of the Commonwealth, the [[Polish culture]], itself influenced by [[Western culture]], drew to itself the [[upper class]]es of the [[Ruthenian]] ([[Belarus]]ian and [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]]) and [[Lithuania]]n communities leading to those [[social class|class]]es' lesser or greater [[alienation]] from their [[ethnic]] roots. 

Polonization was sometimes closely related to conversion to the [[Roman Catholic]] faith, as in some areas and in some historical periods being Polish culturally and Roman Catholic by religion was almost the same, although the correlation was by no means universal. The promotion of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] at the expense of the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox Churches]] was the aspect of Polonization most resented by Belarusian and Ukrainian masses. In contrast the Lithuanians, who were mostly Catholic, were in danger of losing their cultural identity as a nation, but that didn't become evident for the wide masses of Lithuanians until the [[Lithuanian national renaissance]] in the middle of the [[19th century]]. 

In the twentieth century the [[Second Polish Republic]]'s Polonization policies were aimed at achieving an ethnically homogeneous Poland over the entire territory of the Republic while over one third of the Poland's population was non-Polish.  These policies mainly relied on emphasizing the Polish language in education and official use, while discriminating against other languages.  The proponents of this policy hoped that it would result in the Polish language becoming dominant over the continuum of a few generations. Given the short time span in which they were applied, these policies, applied with varying intensity, fell far short of their aim, but contributed to increased ethnic tensions which led to large scale violence during [[World War II]].

==Historic periods of Polonization==
===Poland of Piasts===
Between the [[12th century|12th]] and the [[14th century|14th]] centuries many Polish towns were accorded the so-called [[Magdeburg rights]] that promoted the towns' development and [[trade (profession)|trade]]. The right were usually granted on the occasion of the arrival of the colonists from [[Germany]]. After the years of living amidst the Polish majority of western and central Poland those groups were Polonized. A similar process of Polonization took place in case of merchants that settled  in those areas, especially [[Greeks]] and [[Armenians]], they adopted most aspects of Polish culture but kept their Orthodox faith. Since the middle ages, Polish culture, influenced by the West, in turn radiated east, beginning the long and uneasy process of [[cultural assimilation]].<ref name="Mikos">[[Michael J.

===Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth===
In the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] the minorities (especially [[Ruthenian]] and [[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]]) found themselves under strong cultural and religious pressure of [[Poland]].<ref name=Kost_Poland_Cathlolic>"Due to his marriage [with Jadwiga, Jagiello] converted into the Catholicism and became an ardent proponent of the newly accepted religion and, gratifying the Poles, patronized both the spread of the Catholic religion through the Ruthenian lands and the implementation of the Polonization of Ruthenia.

But this was the very misfortune that the Ruthenian nobility, this very Ruthenian higher class who was benefiting from being under the power of Poland, was not able to hold to its own from the moral oppression, that was burdening the Orthodox religion and the Ruthenian ethnicity. Entering into the relations with the Polish [[Szlachta]], adopting the Polish language and Polish habits, the Ruthenian people were not powerful enough to hold on to their forefathers' religion. Catholicism was supported by the eye catching shine of the Western enlightenment. In Poland, the Ruthenian religion and the Ruthenian ethnicity were looked down at: everything resembling Ruthenian seemed to the eye of the Polish society as rustic, vulgar, savage, ignorant, something an educated and upstanding citizen should be ashamed of. Catholics had much  better means for education and, therefore, the children of the Orthodox nobility were taught by the Catholics. Stirred up by their teachers, who indoctrinated them with the reverence to Catholicism, entering the court, where they in the prevailing propaganda spirit only heard about the same reverence, the Ruthenian youths inevitably adopted the same attitude towards the religion and the ethnicity of their forefathers, as usually common for those who draw on the alienation under the full conviction that the alien is the sign of education and gives the honour and respect in the everyday life which they are to be part of. The converted to the Catholicism descendants of the noble families, looking back at the morality of their forefathers found themselves in the same mood, as their ancestors who abandoned the Paganism and adopted the Christianity many centuries prior to that. One after the other they adopted the new religion and felt ashamed of the previous one. True, as it always is in the transitional periods, so was in the period of Catholicization of the Ruthenian nobility, for as long as half-a-century, or sometimes even longer, there were remaining adherents of the old tradition and they made themselves heard, but those were becoming very few and far between, and finally there were none. In the Polish Ruthenia the person that belonged by blood and by position to the high society became unthinkable other than with the Roman-Catholic religion, with Polish language and with Polish views and perceptions. From the times of Unia there appeared a new aspiration to raise the Ruthenian Church and the Ruthenian ethnicity, to form Ruthenian education, at least the religious one for a start. But this aspiration came too late for the upper class of the Ruthenian lands connected with Poland. This upper class didn't need anything Ruthenian anymore and viewed it with disgust and aversion. It appeared the Unia, thought to be a bait for the Ruthenian upper class, was for it as unnecessary. The nobles became pure Catholics without it. The Unia remained only as a means of destruction among the commoners of the signs of the Orthodox religion and the Ruthenian ethnicity. To accept the Unia meant for a Ruthenian to become a Pole, or at least, semi-Pole. This direction revealed itself from the start and persisted without deviation for times to come until the end of Unia. Despite in the beginning the Pope, in agreement with the 15th century Council of Florence affirmed the sanctity of the Eastern Rite, already in early-17th century the Uniate clerics started to alter the church service and introduced different customs, peculiar for the Western church and non-existing in the Eastern one, or even the repudiated by the latter[...] Becoming close and closer to the Catholicism, Unia seized being an Eastern Church and started something intermediate but remaining the feature of the commoners: in the country were the commoners reached the total degree of enslavement, the religion, the existed for those people could not have enjoyed the equal honor with the religion preached by the superiors; therefore the Unia in Poland became the inferior religion, that of the common people, not worthy of the higher class. As for the Orthodoxy, in the eyes of the society it became the Religion rejected, the lowest one Worthy of the utmost contempt. It was not just the religion of the low-lives in general, like Unia, but the religion of the outcast low-lives, the different ones and unable in their barbarity and obduracy to raise on a somewhat a higher stage of the religious and societal development. It was no more than a pity affiliation of the despicable half-believers, which will not get any salvation even in the next life.<br>{{Ru icon}} Kostomarov "''Knyaz Kostantin Konstantinovich Ostrozhsky''"</ref> on [[Ruthenian nobility]] and cultural elite resulted in almost complete abandonment of [[Ruthenian culture]], traditions and the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox Church]] by the Ruthenian higher class.<ref name=Kost_Concl/> 

The Lithuanian Grand Duke [[Jogaila]] was offered the Polish crown and became [[Jogaila|Władysław II Jagiełło]] (reigned 1386-1434). This marked the slow beginning of the polonization of the Lithuanian gentry. He built many Roman Catholic churches and provided them generously with estates, gave out the lands and positions to the Catholics, settled the cities and villages by the Poles and gave those settlements the [[Magdeburg Rights]] privileges that consisted of many allowances. These rights were given only to the settlements dominated by the Poles and the Germans but not to Ruthenian settlements whose residents were fully taxed. The noble Ruthenians were also freed from many payment obligations and their rights were equalized with those of the Polish Szlachta but only when they adopted the Catholicism. Then they were provided with compensation for the military service, while those who remained Orthodox received none. As such, the entire population of Ruthenia was split into the privileged and non-privileged ones, and the latter were the Orthodox people of Ruthenia.<ref name=KostOstGen>Kostomarov, ''"Ostrozhski"''</ref> 

Under Jagiełło's successor [[Władysław III of Poland|Władysław III of Varna]] (reigned 1434-1444) the Polonization which earlier took place more by force than by other means<ref name=KostWladJagello>"The new Polish king, the son of Jagello, Vladislav [Wladyslaw] named in history "of Varna" due to his death in the battle with Turks at Varna in 1444) curbed significantly the aspirations of Svidrigello [Švitrigaila] by his attitude to the Ruthenian people and the Ruthenian religion. Until that day [under Jagiello] the Poles captured power in Ruthenia by force [...] . Jagiello's successor, Wladyslaw (reigned from 1434), acted differently than his father, although with the same goals in mind. He expanded the privileges and liberties formerly available only to the Ruthenian nobles of the Latin religion to all Ruthenian nobles without exception. This marked the beginning of the reconciliation between Ruthenia and Poland...</ref> attained a certain degree of subtlety. Wladyslaw III introduced some more liberal reforms. He expanded the privilleges to all Ruthenian nobles, irrespective of their religion, and in 1443 he signed a bull equalizing the Orthodox church in rights with the Roman Catholicism thus alleviating the relationship with the Orthodox clergy. These policies continued under the next king [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]]. Still, the mostly cultural expansion of the Polish influence continued since the Ruthenian nobility were attracted by both the glamour of the Western culture and the Polish political order where the [[magnates]] became the unrestricted rulers of the lands and serfs in their vast estates. 

Some Ruthenian magnates like [[Sanguszko]], [[Wiśniowiecki]] and [[Kisiel]], resisted the cultural Polonization for several generations, with the [[Ostrogski]] family being one of the most prominent examples. Remaining generally loyal to the Polish state, the magnates, like Ostrogskis, stood by the religion of their forefathers, and supported the Orthodox Church generously by opening schools, printing books in Ruthenian language (the first four printed [[Cyrillic]] books in the world were published in Cracow, in 1491<ref name="Mikos">[[Michael J. Mikoś]], ''Polish Renaissance Literature: An Anthology''. Ed. Michael J. Mikoś. Columbus, Ohio/Bloomington, Indiana: Slavica Publishers. 1995. ISBN 0-89357-257-8, [http://staropolska.gimnazjum.com.pl/ang/renaissance/Mikos_renaissance/Literary_r.html RENAISSANCE LITERARY BACKGROUND]</ref>) and giving generously to the Orthodox churches' construction. However, their resistance was gradually waning with each subsequent generation as more and more of the Ruthenian elite turned towards Polish language and Catholicism.

Still, with most of the educational system getting Polonized and the most generously funded institutions being to the west of Ruthenia, the Ruthenian indigenous culture further deteriorated. In the Polish Ruthenia the administrative paperwork language started to gradually shift towards the gradual Polish domination. By the 16th century we find the peculiar official language, a mix of the older [[Church Slavonic]] with the [[Ruthenian language]] of the commoners with the [[Polish language]] with the influence of the latter gradually increasing. It soon became mostly like Polish language superimposed on the Ruthenian phonetics. The total confluence of Ruthenia and Poland was seen coming.<ref name=KostOstGen>Kostomarov, ''"Ostrozhski"''</ref>

As the [[Eastern Rite Catholic Churches|Eastern Rite]] [[Greek-Catholic]] Church originally created to accommodate the Ruthenian, initially Orthodox, nobility, ended up unnecessary to them as they converted directly into the [[Latin Rite]] Catholicism en masse, the Church largely became an hierarchy without followers. The Greek Catholic Church was then used as a tool aimed to split even the peasantry from their Ruthenian roots, still mostly unsuccessfully.<ref name="EB_Unia"/> The commoners, deprived of their native protectors, sought protection through the [[Cossacks]],<Ref name="EB_Unia"/> who, being fiercely Orthodox, tended also to easily turn to violence against those they perceived as their enemies, particularly the Polish state and what they saw as its representatives, the Poles and generally the [[Catholic]]s , as well as the Jews.<ref name=KostKhmeln>{{Ru icon}} "''Little Russian Hetman Zinoviy-Bogdan Khmelnytsky''" ([[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]]) in "[[Nikolay Kostomarov]]'s, "Russian History in Biographies of its main figures", [http://www.kulichki.com/inkwell/text/special/history/kostom/kostom36.htm]</ref>

===Partitions===
Polonization also occurred during times when a Polish state didn't exist, although as in that period the German state was engaged in a state-enforced program of [[Germanization]] targeting the Polish minority<ref name="Thomas"/> and similarly, the Russian state was at times engaged in forced [[Russification]], Polonization was either slowed or even revered in certain areas previously controlled by Poland, leading some scholars to speak of this time as the era of 'depolonization' (only in [[Austro-Hungarian]] partition there were few if any policies aimed at 'depolonization').<ref name="Wandycz">Various authors, ''The Treaty of Versailles: a reassessment after 75 years'', Cambridge University Press, 1998, ISBN 0521621321, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0521621321&id=zqj-oHp4KsgC&pg=RA3-PA314&lpg=RA3-PA314&ots=5iXQq4Xpqp&dq=Polonization+partitions&sig=ug7DU1XUzZEFOf4baNCITRMQ8r8 Google Print, p.314]</ref><ref name="Suss_Cubb">[[Roland Sussex]], [[Paul Cubberley]], ''The Slavic Languages'', Cambridge University Press, 2007, ISBN 0521223156, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0521223156&id=G2bsJdYrwD4C&pg=RA2-PA92&lpg=RA2-PA92&dq=partitions+Poland+education&sig=G2-lo04_OMK5kR33wc9L6byMfOw Google Print, p.92]</ref><ref name="MIKHAIL DOLBILOV">[[Mikhail Dolbilov]], [http://mesharpe.metapress.com/(oljda545xblum055350iutny)/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&backto=issue,4,4;journal,4,11;linkingpublicationresults,1:110921,1 The Stereotype of the Pole in Imperial Policy: The "Depolonization" of the Northwestern Region in the 1860s], ''Russian Studies in History'', Issue: Volume 44, Number 2 / Fall 2005, Pages: 44 - 88</ref>

Another situation where Polonization took place was in the early years of the [[Prussia|Prussian]] partition, where as a reaction to the persecution of Roman Catholicism during the [[Kulturkampf]], German Catholics living in areas with a Polish majority voluntarily integrated themselves within Polish society, affecting approximately 100,000 Germans in the eastern provinces of Prussia<ref name="Thomas">[http://spartan.ac.brocku.ca/~lward/Thomas/Thomas_1913.html The Prussian-Polish Situation: An experiment in Assimilation] by [[W.I.

According to some scholars the biggest successes in Polonisation of the non-Polish lands of former Commonwealth were achieved after the Partitions, in times of persecution of Polishness (noted by [[Leon Wasilewski]] (1917<ref>Wasilewski L.

Paradoxically, the substantial eastward movement of the Polish ethnical territory (over these lands) and growth of the Polish ethnic regions were taking place exactly in the period of the strongest Russian attack on everything Polish in Lithuania and Belarus<ref>"In times of Myravyov the Hanger", as noted in (Wasilewski 1917), p.VII as cited in (Smalyanchuk 2001), p.24.

Following the [[Partitions of Poland|demise of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in the end of the eighteens century, the Polonization trends initially continued in Lithuania, Belarus and Polish-dominated parts of Ukraine as the initially liberal policies of the Empire gave the Polish elite significant concessions in the local affairs.

Dovnar-Zapolsky notes that "the 1800s – 1810s had seen the unprecedented prosperity of the Polish culture and language in the former Great Duchy of Lithuania lands" and "this era has seen the effective completion of the Polonization of the smallest nobility, with further reduction of the areal of use of the contemporary [[Belarusian language]].<ref name=Dovnar290>Dovnar-Zapolsky, pp.290-298.</ref> also noting that the Polonization trend had been complemented with the (covert) anti-Russian and anti-Orthodox trends.<ref name="Dovnar_p293">Dovnar-Zapolsky, pp.293—296.</ref> The Lithuanian opposition to these development was quieted by various, sometimes even violent means.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

The trends continued with the [[French invasion of Russia (1812)|arrival of Napoleon in 1812]]. The Poles continued to occupy the most important positions in the Vilnius government of Lithuania and following the restoration of the Russian rule the central government policies changed little. [[Jan Śniadecki]], who was promoted under Napoleon times to the rank of the Minister of Education and Cults retained his rectorship due to the Czartoryski's protection. As Alexander's plan to break Lithuania away from Poland through the restoration of the Grand Duchy became apparent, Sniadecki, supported by Czartoryski, who pretended to be faithful to Tzar, made the last ditch effort to Polonize the young generation of Lithuanians by educating them as Poles that would join the ranks of the strugle for the independent and homogeneous Poland.<ref name=Yla/>

Following the Polish [[November Uprising]] aimed at breaking away from Russia, the Imperial policies changed abruptly. The University was forcibly closed in 1832 and the following years where characterized by the policies aimed at the assimilationist solution of the "Polish question", the trend that was further strengthen following another unsuccessful [[January Uprising]] (1863).{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

In the 19th century, the mostly unchallenged Polonization trend of the previous centuries had been met staunchly by then "[[anti-Polish]]" [[Russification]] policy, with temporary successes on both sides, like Polonization rises in mid-1850s and in 1880s and Russification strengthenings in 1830s and in 1860s.<ref name="Dovnar_p303">Dovnar-Zapolsky, pp.303—315,319—320,328—331.</ref> Any Polonization of the east and west territories (Russian and German partitions) occured in the situation were Poles had steadily diminishing influence on the government.

===Second Polish Republic===
By the times of [[Second Polish Republic]] (1918-1939) much of the territories controlled by Poland over a century ago (at the Commonwealth's time), that were historically mixed (partly Ruthenian and partly Polish), had the Ukrainian and Belarusian majority.<ref name="Cienciala">[http://www.ku.edu/~eceurope/hist557/lect11.htm THE REBIRTH OF POLAND]. University of Kansas, lecture notes by professor [[Anna M. Cienciala]], 2004. Last accessed on 2 June 2006. Quote:"there were large Polish minorities in what is today western Belarus, western Ukraine and central Ukraine. According to the Polish Census of 1931, Poles made up 5,600,000 of the total population of eastern Poland which stood at 13,021,000.* In Lithuania, Poles had majorities in the Vilnius [P. Wilno, Rus. Vilna] and Suwałki areas, as well as significant numbers in and around Kaunas [P.Kowno]."</ref> Following the post-[[World War I]] rebirth of the Polish statehood, these lands became again disputed but the Poles were more successful than the nascent [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]] in the [[Polish-Ukrainian War]]. Thus, in the wake of the Poland's elimination of Ukrainian statehood attempt in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)]] and [[Volhynia]] followed by the [[Polish-Soviet War|further westward expansion into Belarus]] which the [[Soviet Russia]] succeeded to deter only to a degree, these territories ended up under the Polish control. As such, Poland had to deal with the problems it brought upon itself by expanding into non-Polish populated territories as the approximately one third of new state's population was non-Polish and non-Catholic.<ref name=Roshwald_p144>"Poland['s] one third of population consisted of non-Poles, many of whom felt bitterly alienated from a state that had forcibly incorporated them into itself...

The Ukrainian territories of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] and [[Volhynia]] had different backgrounds, different late histories and different dominant religions. Until the First World War, Galicia with its largely [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Greek Catholic]] Ukrainian population, was controlled by the [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian Empire]] whose local policies were relatively pro-Ukrainian (Ruthenian) in an attempt to cement the Austrian control over the territories and prevent the political trends of population's leaning towards the rest of Ukrainians controlled by the [[Russian Empire]]. Such policies resulted in much stronger national self-perception among the Galicia Ukrainians. On the other hand, the Ukrainians of Volhynia, formerly of the [[Russian Empire]], were largely [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox by religion]], and were influenced by the strong [[Russophile]] trends. Therefore, while the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] (UGCC), which functions in [[Full communion|communion]] with the [[Latin Rite]] Catholicism, could have hoped to receive a better treatment in Poland, where the leadership saw the Catholicism as one of the main tools to unify the nation, the Poles saw the Greek Catholic Galicia Ukrainians as even less reliable than the Orthodox Volhynia Ukrainians seen as good candidates for the political assimilation. As such the Polish policy in Ukraine initially was aimed at keeping "bad" Greek Catholic Galicians from influencing "good" Orthodox Volhynians.<ref name="Snyder">[[Timothy Snyder]], ''The Reconstruction of Nations: Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania, Belarus, 1569-1999'', Yale University Press, ISBN 0-300-10586-X[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN030010586X&id=xSpEynLxJ1MC&pg=PA144&lpg=PA144&dq=stanislaw+grabski&sig=5kSKOnXipwsTitk7w_hotRTooPQ Google Books, p.144]</ref> 

Due to the region's history the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] attained a strong Ukrainian national character, and the Polish authorities sought to weaken it in various ways. In 1924, following a visit with the Ukrainian Catholic believers in North America and western Europe, the head of the UGCC was initially denied reentry to Lviv until after a considerable delay. Polish priests led by their bishops began to undertake missionary work among Eastern Rite faithful, and the administrative restrictions were placed on the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church <ref name=Magosci>{{cite book| author=Magosci, P. | title=Morality and Reality: the Life and Times of Andrei Sheptytsky| location= Edmonton, Alberta | publisher= Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies, University of Alberta | year = 1989| }}</ref>. 

With respect to the Orthodox Ukrainian population in eastern Poland, the [[Polish government]] initially issued a decree defending the rights of the Orthodox minorities. In practice, this often failed, as the [[Catholics]], also eager to strengthen their position, had official representation in the [[Sejm]] and the courts. Any accusation was strong enough for a particular church to be confiscated and handed over to the Roman Catholic church. 190 Orthodox churches were destroyed (some of the destroyed churches were abandoned<ref name="BP">''The Impact of External Threat on States and Domestic Societie'', [[Manus I.

How to deal with the non-Polish minorities was a subject of intense debate within the Polish leadership. Two ideas of Polish policy clashed at the time - a more tolerant and arguably less assimilationist approach advocated by [[Józef Piłsudski]],<ref name="Brzez">[[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] in his introduction to Wacław Jędrzejewicz’s “Pilsudski A Life For Poland” wrote: ''Pilsudski’s vision of Poland, paradoxically, was never attained. He contributed immensely to the creation of a modern Polish state, to the preservation of Poland from the Soviet invasion, yet he failed to create <u>the kind of multinational commonwealth, based on principles of social justice and ethnic tolerance, to which he aspired in his youth</u>. One may wonder how relevant was his image of such a Poland in the age of nationalism...''. Quoted from [http://members.lycos.co.uk/jozefpilsudski/index2.html this website].</ref> <ref name="Polonica">[http://www.polonica.net/Marshal-Jozef-Pilsudski.htm Marshal Jozef Pilsudski. Messiah and Central European Federalist]. Polonica.net article by [[Patryk Dole]]</ref> whose project of creating a [[Międzymorze]] [[federation]] with other states failed in the [[aftermath of the Polish-Soviet War]], clashed with the eventually prevailing strictly nationalist and assimilationist approach advocated by [[Roman Dmowski]], a minister of foreign affairs, and [[Stanisław Grabski]], a minister of religion and education. Dmowski and Grabski saw the solution of the "minorities problem" in imposing  "Polish values" (Polish language and the Catholic Church) on the minorities to achieve "national assimilation", i.e. to make them "Polish" within the "next generation".<ref name="Snyder"/> On the other hand, [[Józef Piłsudski]], a Polish [[chief of State]] who also controlled the army, supported "state" rather than "national" assimilation as a more practical approach. 

As most of the Polish government was initially controlled by [[Roman Dmowski]], leader of ''[[endecja]]'' and a strong proponent of Polonization,<ref name="BFG">[[Manfred F. Boemeke]], [[Gerald D.

When the territories of [[Western Belarus]], [[Western Ukraine]] and the [[Wilno Voivodship|Wilno region]] were incorporated by Poland after the [[Treaty of Riga]], Poland rejected its international obligations to grant the autonomy to [[eastern Galicia]]{{ref|Stakhiv}} which Poland never intended to follow anyway.<ref name=Roshwald_p144/> The linguistic assimilation was considered as a major factor of "unifying the state" by [[National Democratic Party (Poland)|National Democrats]]. For example, [[Stanisław Grabski]], Polish Minister for Religion and Public Education in 1923 and 1925-1926 wrote that ''"Poland may be preserved only as the state of Polish people. If it were a state of Poles, Jews, Germans, Rusyns, Belarusians, Lithuanians, Russians, it would lose its independence again"'' and that ''"it is impossible to make a nation of those who do not have the 'national self-identification', who calls themselves "local" ([[Tutejszy]])"''{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.

It the area of public education it was postulated that state schools could be only Polish language schools<ref name="Snyder"/>. Local populations could have private local language schools, but only in territories "loyal to the Polish state"{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. Specifically with respect to the Eastern territories (known as ''[[Kresy Wschodnie]]'', or "Eastern Borderlands") it was recognized that ''"schools can become an instrument of the cultural development in Eastern lands only if Polish teachers will work there"''{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. It turned out to be infeasible for implementation and, in particular cases, bilingual ("utraquist") schools were proposed, while in reality those schools were functionally the Polish language ones.<ref name="Snyder"/> 

In internal politics, Piłsudski's reign marked the much needed stabilization and improvements in the situation of [[ethnic minorities]], which formed almost a third of the population of the Second Republic. Piłsudski replaced ''endecja's'' 'ethnic assimilation' with the 'state assimilation' policy: citizens were judged by their loyalty to the state, not by their nationality.<ref name="Snyder"/> The years 1926-1935 were favourably viewed by many [[Polish Jews]], whose situation improved especially under the cabinet of Piłsudski’s appointee [[Kazimierz Bartel]].<ref name="Cieplinski">[[Feigue Cieplinski]], ''Poles and Jews: The Quest For Self-Determination 1919-1934'', Binghamton Journal of History, Fall 2002, Last accessed on 2 June, 2006.</ref> However a combination of various reasons, from the [[Great Depression]]<ref name="Snyder"/>, through the Pisłudski's need for support from parties for the parliament's election<ref name="Snyder"/> to the [[vicious spiral]] of terrorist attacks by [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]] and government pacifications<ref name="Davies_GP2-407">Davies, God's Playground, op.cit., [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0231053525&id=DMoPXktGwiUC&pg=PA407&lpg=PA407&dq=Davies+OUN+terrorism&sig=n2yftCtdccp3U4rPQL8OcBtH9_8]</ref> <ref name="Snyder"/> meant that the situation continued to degenerate, despite Piłsudski's efforts. The attitude of Ukrainians of that time is well shown in the statements by the reputable Ukrainian historian [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]], who noted negative influence of Polish policies on the [[Ukrainian culture]]: "the four centuries of Polish rule had left particularly destructive effects (...) economic and cultural backwardness in [[Galicia]] was the main "legacy of historical Poland, which assiduously skimmed everything that could be considered the cream of the nation, leaving it in a state of oppression and helplessness".<ref>C.

After the [[Polish legislative election, 1930]], Belarusian representation in the [[Polish parliament]] was reduced and since the early 1930's the Polish government started to introduce policies intended to Polonize the minorities{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. In [[1938]] about 100 abandoned<ref name="BP"/>Orthodox churches were destroyed or converted to [[Roman Catholic]] in the eastern parts of Poland<ref name="mironowicz">[[Eugeniusz Mironowicz]], ''"Białoruś"'', Trio, Warszawa, 1999, ISBN 83-85660-82-8, p. 109</ref>. The use of [[Belarusian language]] was discouraged. There wasn't a Belarusian school  in the spring of [[1939]], and only 44 schools teaching Belarusian language existed in Poland at the beginning of [[World War II]]{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.

=== Post World War II ===
Ethnic Germans still living in the western territories gained by Poland (determined by [[Tehran Conference]] by [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] in the aftermath of World War II - e.g. Silesia) were denied the use of their language in public by the Communist regime and they had to adopt the Polish language and citizenship to evade discrimination, expropriation and insult. Some 180,000 were sent to forced work camps like camp Tost, camp Potulice or camp Lambsdorf.<ref name="WB_HL">[[Włodzimierz Borodziej]], [[Hans Lemberg]], ''Unsere Heimat ist uns ein fremdes Land geworden...

Western Germany however did not recognize this agreement. Until 1953 there were 55 German basic schools and 2 higher German schools in Poland. Unlike the Poles in Germany, the Germans enjoy a formally recognized status of an ethnic minority in modern Poland.

During [[Operation Wisła]] in [[1947]], the Ukrainian and [[Rusyn]] populations were forcibly resettled from their historic territories in the south-east of  Poland to northern areas of the [[recovered territories|territories]] awarded by [[Allies of World War II|the Allies]] to Poland in the post-war settlement. According to the order of the Ministry of [[Recovered Territories]] ''"the main goal of the relocation of settlers "W" is their assimilation in a new Polish environment, all efforts should be exerted to achieve those goals.

As a consequence of the process of cultural Polonization, disputes occur as to the ethnicity of some notable persons such as [[Tadeusz Kościuszko]], [[Adam Mickiewicz]] and [[Ignacy Domeyko]], who are claimed as national celebrities by [[Poles]], [[Belarusians]] and [[Lithuanians]] alike.
