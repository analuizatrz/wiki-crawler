'''''Space Science Fiction Magazine''''' was a US [[science fiction magazine]] published by Republic Features Syndicate, Inc. Two issues appeared, both in 1957. It published stories by well-known writers, including [[Arthur C. Clarke]] and [[Jack Vance]], but it was not successful, and the magazine ceased publication late in 1957.
__NOTOC__
==Publication history and contents==
Science fiction was one of the staple genres of American pulp magazine publishing, beginning in 1926 with ''[[Amazing Stories]]''.  A brief boom in the late 1930s was cut short by World War II, but the field expanded again in the late 1940s.<ref>Nicholls & Clute, "Genre SF", p.&nbsp;483, and Edwards & Nicholls, "SF Magazines", pp.&nbsp;1066&ndash;1071, both in Clute & Nicholls, ''Encyclopedia of Science Fiction''.</ref>  By 1957 the boom had reached its height;<ref name=AshleyV4_23>Ashley, ''The History of the Science Fiction Magazine Part 4'', p.&nbsp;23.</ref> 24 science fiction magazines published at least one issue that year.<ref name=AshleyV4_index>Magazine publishing dates for the period are tabulated in Ashley, ''The History of the Science Fiction Magazine Part 4'', pp.&nbsp;270&ndash;271.</ref>  One of the most prominent of these magazines, ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'', had a successful association with two radio shows, [[Dimension X]] and [[X Minus One]].  This sparked imitators, and during 1956 Lyle Kenyon Engel put together a package of two radio shows and four magazines.  The shows were ''[[American Agent]]'', a spy drama, and ''[[The Frightened]]'', to be narrated by [[Boris Karloff]].  The magazine package included a spy magazine and a horror magazine to tie in with the radio shows, and two additional titles: ''Private Investigator Detective Magazine'' and ''Space Science Fiction Magazine''.  ''Private Investigator''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s first issue was published in 1956, but problems with the radio schedules delayed the launch of the other magazines until 1957.<ref name=Ashley_T176>Ashley, ''Transformations'', pp.&nbsp;176–177.</ref>

''Space''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s first issue was dated Spring 1957, although its masthead indicated that it would be a bimonthly. It was published by Republic Features Syndicate, Inc., of New York, and edited by [[Michael Avallone]], who was not credited on the masthead.<ref>The masthead lists Lyle Kenyon Engel as the editor.  See Ashley, ''Transformations'', pp.&nbsp;176–177.</ref> All its advertisements were for radio shows, including ''American Agent'' and ''The Frightened''. Engel obtained stories from moderately well-known science fiction names for both issues, including [[John Jakes]], [[Mack Reynolds]], [[Jack Vance]], and [[Raymond F. Jones]], but many of the stories were "barrel-scrapings" from the [[Scott Meredith Literary Agency]], in the words of one historian;<ref name=Ashley_T176/> most had already been rejected at the other active science fiction markets. ''Space'' also published Arthur C. Clarke's "Critical Mass", one of the popular "[[Tales from the White Hart|White Hart]]" stories. It had already appeared in a 1949 edition of a British magazine, ''Lilliput'', but Clarke revised it for this publication. Overall, in the words of [[Mike Ashley (writer)|Mike Ashley]], "...&nbsp;[it] carried stories by noted sf writers, [but] they read like rejects from better magazines, and there was nothing of lasting value".<ref name=AshleyV4>Ashley, ''The History of the Science Fiction Magazine Part 4'', p.&nbsp;22.</ref> Ashley comments that the best story was Jakes's "The Devil Spins a Sun-Dream", which was atmospheric if poorly plotted; the protagonist, a human prospector on Mars, finds a fabulous city, but an ancient booby-trap destroys it before his eyes.  The second issue was dated August 1957; this proved to be the final issue, as shortly thereafter Republic Features Syndicate went out of business.<ref name=AshleyV4/><ref name=Tuck>Tuck, ''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy'', vol. 3, p. 604.</ref><ref name=issues>See the individual issues.
