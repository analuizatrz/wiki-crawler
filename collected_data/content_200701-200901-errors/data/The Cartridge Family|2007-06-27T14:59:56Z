==Production notes==
This was originally called "Homer Gets A Gun". {{fact|date=June 2007}} The opening sequence where soccer is portrayed as the most boring sport imaginable was based on an incident where John Swartzwelder watched the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States']] opening match in the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]] at the urging of a friend. Swartzwelder switched it off after 20 minutes, and vowed never to watch another game.{{fact|date=June 2007}} The end credits were originally to have the song "[[Happiness Is a Warm Gun]]" by [[The Beatles]], but [[Michael Jackson]] didn't allow them to use it in time. {{fact|date=June 2007}} The writers got into an argument with Fox censors over having Bart hold the gun at Milhouse with the apple in his mouth. This was announced during the DVD Commentary for this episode.<ref>{{Cite video | people= [[Mike Scully]] to [[Yeardley Smith]] | year = 2006 | title = [[The Simpsons DVD boxsets#The Complete Ninth Season|The Complete Ninth Season]] - The Cartridge Family DVD commentary | medium = DVD | publisher  = [[20th Century Fox]] | accessdate = 2007-06-12 | time = 14 minutes, 41 seconds | quote = You're right Yeardley.

==Plot==

The Simpsons, along with most other residents of Springfield attend a [[football (soccer)|soccer]] match. When the game starts, the crowd begins to lose interest and it turns into a violent soccer riot (taking off frequent English football riots). Eventually the riot escalates and spreads all over springfield, forcing [[mob rule]] to be installed. Homer does not want to pay $500 for a Home Security System and decides to buy a firearm. 

After a 5 day waiting period, Homer surprises Marge with his new [[revolver]]. She is horrified and appalled, demanding that he get rid of the gun at once. Homer persuades Marge to come with him to the local [[National Rifle Association]] meeting to try and get her to change her mind, and suggests that "Just come with me to a meeting, and if you still don't think guns are great, we'll argue some more". After the meeting, she still remains unconvinced.

Homer treats the gun as though it were a toy, casually carrying it into the [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon|Kwik-E-Mart]], firing bullets to retrieve items from the roof and shooting dinner plates as if they were [[clay pigeon]]s. Finally, after a near fatal accident at the dinner table, Marge gives Homer an [[ultimatum]] "It's your gun or your family, we ''can't'' live in the same house!"  

Homer promises to get rid of the gun, but he hides it in the vegetable crisper drawer of the refrigerator. Later, Bart and Milhouse discover the gun and play [[William Tell]] in the kitchen. Marge discovers what is going on and confiscates the gun before Bart blows Milhouse' brains out. Angry at Homer for having lied to her about the gun, Marge gathers the children and leaves for a hotel.

That night, Homer hosts an NRA meeting at his house but his reckless usage of his gun appalls the other members of the NRA and he is kicked out of the association. Realizing what his gun has cost him, Homer goes to the hotel to tell Marge he has gotten rid of it.

Homer and Marge make up, but while walking through the lobby to leave, [[Snake Jailbird|Snake]] arrives to rob the desk clerk, demanding the cash register's contents while holding a knife to [[Joe Quimby|Mayor Quimby's]] throat. Homer pulls out his gun and disrupts the robbery. Marge is angry at Homer for lying to her again, and he pleads to her "I know I said that, but what I secretly meant was--" and Snake snatches the gun. Moe and some other NRA members arrive and Snake runs off with the money. Homer then asks Marge to get rid of the gun for him. Marge is about to deposit it in a trashcan when the shiny metal lid shows the reflection of herself holding the gun. She admires what she sees and decides to keep the gun for herself.

==Reception==
This episode of The Simpsons involves debate about the ownership of guns, but the writers of the episode didn't want to make a point about guns,<ref>{{cite video | people = [[Mike Scully]] | year = 2006 | title = [[The Simpsons DVD boxsets#The Complete Ninth Season|The Complete Ninth Season]] - The Cartridge Family DVD commentary | medium = DVD | publisher  = [[20th Century Fox]] | accessdate = 2007-06-12 | time = 11 minutes, 11 seconds | quote = We don't want to do a message, but I guess if there is a message in it then it's a guy like Homer Simpson shouldn't have a gun, if there's any message at all.}}</ref> or take sides at all. <ref>{{cite video | people = [[Mike Scully]] | year = 2006 | title = [[The Simpsons DVD boxsets#The Complete Ninth Season|The Complete Ninth Season]] - The Cartridge Family DVD commentary | medium = DVD | publisher  = [[20th Century Fox]] | accessdate = 2007-06-12 | time = 13 minutes | quote = We definitely tried to not take a position}}</ref> Despite a claiming to have an unbiased story, critics still say this episode does not.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season9/page5.shtml | title=The Cartridge Family episode review | work ="I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide" and the [[BBC]] | author=Martyn, Warren and Wood, Adrian | date=[[2000]] | accessdate=2007-06-12 | format=html}}</ref> According to the DVD commentary, complaints about the portrayal of the NRA were received by the NRA.<ref>{{cite video | people = [[Mike Scully]] | year = 2006 | title = [[The Simpsons DVD boxsets#The Complete Ninth Season|The Complete Ninth Season]] - The Cartridge Family DVD commentary | medium = DVD | publisher  = [[20th Century Fox]] | accessdate = 2007-06-12 | time = 11 minutes, 37 seconds | quote = We got a lot of angry letters from the NRA after this episode}}</ref> This despite the fact that the Springfield NRA membership, including relatively stable characters like Dr. Hibbert and Agnes Skinner, are unanimously against Homer's irresponsible gun use.

This episode was banned from the [[United Kingdom|UK]] satellite channel [[Sky One]] due to scenes of flagrant gun misuse and of being somewhat offensive to British, though it had been released on the ''Too Hot for TV'' [[VHS]] and [[DVD]], and was aired several times on [[BBC Two]] from [[26 October]] [[2001]] to [[2003]]. It finally aired on Sky One for the first time on [[26 September]] [[2005]], eight years after its original planned premiere date of [[30 November]] [[1997]]. {{fact|date=June 2007}}

==Cultural references==
The quip Marge makes about the soccer stadium being a former [[internment camp]] is a reference to the [[Chilean Coup of 1973]] where opponents of the coup were held in a makeshift internment camp inside the national soccer stadium.
