The '''West Island Colleges''' are a set of private [[Canada|Canadian]] [[junior high]] and [[high school]]s, one of which is located in [[Montreal]]'s [[West Island]], and the other in the south-east of [[Calgary]]. The schools also offer a program known as Class Afloat that provides students with an educational experience while sailing all over the world.

==History==
The College was founded in 1974 by Terry D. Davies in [[Pointe-Claire]], [[Quebec]], located on the West Island of Montreal.  The Montreal campus has since moved to Dollard des Ormeaux, a nearby suburb also on the West Island.  The original purpose of the College was to fill the need for an academic program in the West Island area that would adequatly prepare students for their post-secondary studies.

The College has grown rapidly over time, from a mere 40 students in its initial years to a population of over 400 students.  This growth continued with the addition of West Island College Calgary in 1982.  Since then, WIC Calgary has grown from a mere 39 students to roughly 450 students.  

The College again expanded its offerings in 1985 with the addition of the Class Afloat program.  Class Afloat is a co-educational sailing program that provides high school credit to students through the onboard teaching of class.  Students may sail for one or two semesters aboard the boat. Its goal is to not only teach students academically but to teach them experientially.  Class Afloat has taken place, since its founding, on the S.V. Concordia. However, in the 2007/2008 school year, another boat, the S.Y. Fryderyk Chopin will be added to the program's fleet, in partnership with [The Lunenburg Academy], located in [[Lunenburg, Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]].
