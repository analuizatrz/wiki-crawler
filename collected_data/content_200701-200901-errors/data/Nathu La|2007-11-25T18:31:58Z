'''Nathu La''' {{audio|Nathula.ogg|listen}} ([[Nepali language|Nepali]]: नाथू ला, [[IAST]]: ''Nāthū Lā''; {{bo|t=རྣ་ཐོས་ལ་}}) is a [[mountain pass]] in the [[Himalayas]]. It is located on the Indo–China border connecting the [[India]]n [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[Sikkim]] with the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] of the [[People's Republic of China]]. The pass, at 4,310 [[metres|m]] (14,140 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]]) above [[mean sea level]], forms part of an offshoot of the ancient [[Silk Road]]. ''Nathu'' means "listening ears" and ''La'' means "pass" in [[Tibetan language|Tibetan]].<ref name="toi-1"> {{cite news

Nathu La is one of the three trading border posts between China and India; the other two are [[Shipkila]] in [[Himachal Pradesh]] and [[Lipu-Lekh pass|Lipulekh]] (or Lipulech) in [[Uttarakhand]].<ref name="zee">{{cite web| url=http://www.zeenews.com/articles.asp?aid=307263&sid=NAT | title=Nathula reopens for trade after 44 years | work="Zee News" | date=[[2006-07-06]] | accessdate=2006-07-06}}</ref> Sealed by India after the 1962 [[Sino-Indian War]], it was re-opened in 2006 following numerous bilateral trade agreements. The opening of the pass is expected to bolster the economy of the region and play a key role in the growing Sino-Indian trade. Currently, agreements between the two nations limit trade across the pass to the export of 29 types of goods from India and import of 15  from the Chinese side. The opening also shortens the travel distance to important [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] pilgrimage sites in the region.

==History==
Nathu La is located on the 563 km (333 mi) Old Silk Route (an offshoot of the historic [[Silk Road]]), connecting [[Lhasa]] in [[Tibet]] to the plains of [[Bengal]] to the south. In 1815, trade picked up in volume after the [[British Empire|British]] annexed territories belonging to the Sikkimese, [[Nepal]]ese, and [[Bhutan]]ese. The potential of Nathu La was realised in 1873, after the [[Darjeeling]] [[Deputy Commissioner]] published a report on the strategic importance of mountain passes between Sikkim and Tibet. In December 1893, the [[Chogyal|Sikkimese monarchy]] and Tibetan rulers signed an agreement to increase trade between the two nations.<ref name="toi-1"/> The agreement culminated in 1894 when the trade pass was opened.<ref name="timeline">{{cite news

[[Image:Younghusband-team-1904.jpg|thumb|The British expeditionary force led by Major Younghusband (seated centre)]]
Nathu La played a key role in the 1903–1904 [[British expedition to Tibet]], which sought to prevent the Russian Empire from interfering in Tibetan affairs and thus gaining a foothold in the region. In 1904, Major [[Francis Younghusband]], serving as the British Commissioner to Tibet, led a successful mission through Nathu La to capture Lhasa. This led to the setting up of trading posts at [[Gyantse]] and [[Gartok]] in Tibet, and gave control of the surrounding [[Chumbi Valley]] to the British. The following November, China and Great Britain ratified an agreement approving trade between Sikkim and Tibet.<ref name="Thieves">Carrington, Michael: "Officers Gentlemen and Thieves: The Looting of Monasteries during the 1903/4 Younghusband Mission to Tibet", Modern Asian Studies 37, 1 (2003), pp 81–109.</ref><ref name="toi-2"> {{cite news

In 1947, a popular vote for Sikkim to join newly-independent India failed and [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]] [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] agreed to a special protectorate status for Sikkim. Sikkim agreed to be a protectorate nation and Indian troops were allowed to man its borders, including Nathu La. During this period, more than 1,000 mules and 700 people were involved in cross-border trade through Nathu La.<ref name="timeline"/> In 1949, when the Tibetan government expelled the Chinese living there, most of the displaced Chinese returned home through the Nathu La–Sikkim–Kolkata route.<ref name="Sweetness">{{cite web| url= http://specials.rediff.com/news/2006/jul/06sld03.htm| title=Nathu La: 'Sweetness and light' | date=[[2006-07-06]] | accessdate=2006-12-01 | publisher=Rediff.com}}</ref>

With the absence of air or rail facilities in the region in the 1950s, Nathu La was used by several dignitaries to cross the international boundary between Tibet and Sikkim. The current Dalai Lama, [[Tenzin Gyatso]], used this pass to travel to India for the 2,500th birthday celebration of [[Gautam Buddha]], which was held between November 1956 and February 1957.<ref name="Dalai Lama">{{cite news |first=Sunanda K|last=Datta Ray| title = Nathu La: It's more than revival of a trade route| publisher = Phayul.com|date = [[2006-07-10]]|url= http://www.phayul.com/news/article.aspx?id=13200&t=1&c=1 | accessdate = 2006-12-02}}</ref> Later, on [[1 September]] [[1958]], Nehru, his daughter [[Indira Gandhi]], and [[Palden Thondup Namgyal]] (son of—and internal affairs adviser to—[[Tashi Namgyal]], the [[Chogyal]] of Sikkim) used this pass to travel to nearby Bhutan.

After the People's Republic of China took control of Tibet in 1950 and suppressed a Tibetan uprising in 1959, the passes into Sikkim became a conduit for refugees from Tibet. During the 1962 [[Sino-Indian War]], Nathu La witnessed skirmishes between soldiers of the two countries. Shortly thereafter, the passage was sealed and remained closed for more than four decades.<ref name="trading">{{cite news |author =Xinhua|url = http://english.people.com.cn/200607/07/eng20060707_280785.html|title = Roundup: "Silk Road" rejoins at Nathu La Pass after 44 years|publisher = People's Daily Online|date = [[2006-07-07]]|accessdate = 2006-11-26}}</ref> Between [[7 September|7]] and [[13 September]] [[1967]], China's [[People's Liberation Army]] and the [[Indian Army]] had six-day "border skirmishes", including the exchange of heavy artillery fire.<ref name=sreedhar>{{cite web

During the 1990s, bilateral trade agreements were signed by India and China that paved way for opening of the pass. In December 1991, India and China signed the ''Memorandum on the Resumption of Border Trade''; subsequently, in July 1992, the ''Protocol on Entry and Exit Procedures for Border Trade'' was signed. These two documents contained provisions for border trade through Nathu La. On [[23 June]] [[2003]], India and China signed the ''Memorandum on Expanding Border Trade'' that provided for the use of Nathu La in border trade between India and China.<ref name="MEA">{{cite web| url= http://meaindia.nic.in/pressrelease/2006/07/06pr01.htm| title=On the inaugural function for the resumption of border trade between India and China held at Nathu La| date=[[2006-07-06]] | accessdate=2006-12-01 | publisher=Ministry of External Affairs, New Delhi}}</ref>

In 2003, with the thawing of [[Sino-Indian relations]], Indian Prime Minister [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]]'s visit to China led to the resumption of talks on opening the border. Later in 2004, the Indian Defence Minister's visit to China led to the formal opening of the pass.  

The opening, originally scheduled for [[2 October]] [[2005]], was postponed due to last-minute infrastructure problems on the Chinese side. Finally, after a decade of talks, Nathu La was opened on [[6 July]] [[2006]].<ref name="bbc-1">{{cite web| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5150682.stm | title=Historic India-China link opens | date=[[2006-07-06]] | accessdate=2006-07-06 | work=[[BBC News]]}}</ref> The date of the re-opening coincided with the birthday of the reigning Dalai Lama, and is widely seen as a snub to the [[International Tibet Independence Movement]].<ref name="toi-2"/> In the years before the re-opening, the only person permitted to cross the barbed-wire frontier was a Chinese postman with an Indian military escort, who would hand over mail to his Indian counterpart in a building at the border.

==Flora and fauna==
[[Image:Nathu La Fauna 1.jpg|thumb|Vegetation of the region]]
Because of the steep elevation increase around the pass', the vegetation graduates from [[sub-tropical]] forest at its base, to a temperate region, to a wet and dry [[alpine climate]], and finally to cold [[tundra]] desert devoid of vegetation. Around Nathu La and the Tibetan side, the region has little vegetation besides scattered shrubs. Major species found in the region include dwarf [[rhododendron]]s (''Rhododendron anthopogon'', ''R. setosum'') and [[juniper]]s. The meadows include the genera ''[[Poa]]'', ''[[Meconopsis]]'', ''[[Pedicularis]]'', ''[[Primula]]'', and ''[[Aconitum]]''. The region has a four-month growing season during which grasses, [[sedges]] and [[medicinal herb]]s grow abundantly and support a host of insects, wild and domestic herbivores, larks, and finches. The nearby [[Kyongnosla Alpine Sanctuary]] has rare, endangered [[Spathoglottis|ground orchida]] and rhododendrons interspersed among tall junipers and [[silver fir]]s.<ref name="Alpine Sanctuary">{{cite web|url= http://www.scstsenvis.nic.in/Sikkim%20chapter.pdf|title= Ecodestination of India-Sikkim Chapter|accessdate= 2006-12-01|author= Envis Team|date=[[2006-06-04]]|format=PDF|work=Eco-destinations of India |publisher= The Environmental Information System (ENVIS), Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of India|pages=114}}</ref> 

There are no permanent human settlements in the region, though it has a large number of defence personnel who man the borders on both sides. A small number of nomadic Tibetan graziers or ''Dokpas''  herd yak, sheep and [[pashmina]]-type goats in the region. There has been intense grazing pressure due to domestic and wild herbivores on the land. Yaks are found in these parts, and in many hamlets they serve as [[beasts of burden]].<ref name="Yak">{{cite web|url= http://www.scstsenvis.nic.in/Sikkim%20chapter.pdf|title= Ecodestination of India-Sikkim Chapter|accessdate= 2006-12-01|author= Envis Team|date=[[2006-06-04]]|format=PDF|work=Eco-destinations of India |publisher= The Environmental Information System (ENVIS), Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of India}}</ref> The region around Nathu La contains many endangered species, including [[Goa (antelope)|Tibetan gazelle]], [[snow leopard]], [[Tibetan wolf]], [[Tibetan snowcock]], [[lammergeier]], [[raven]], [[golden eagle]], and [[ruddy shelduck]]. 

[[Feral dog]]s are considered a major hazard in this region. The presence of [[landmine]]s in the area causes casualties among yak, [[nayan]], [[kiang]], and Tibetan wolf.<ref name="Vegetation">{{cite web|url= http://www.scstsenvis.nic.in/Sikkim%20chapter.pdf|title= Ecodestination of India-Sikkim Chapter|accessdate= 2006-12-01|author= Envis Team|date=[[2006-06-04]]|format=PDF|work=Eco-destinations of India |publisher= The Environmental Information System (ENVIS), Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of India|pages=44}}</ref>

The avifauna consists of various types of [[Laughingthrush|laughing thrushes]], which live in shrubs and on the forest floor. The blue whistling [[thrush]], [[redstart]]s, and [[forktail]]s are found near waterfalls and hill-streams. The mixed hunting species present in the region include [[warbler]]s, [[Old World babbler|tit-babbler]]s, [[treecreeper]]s, [[white-eye]]s, [[wren]]s, and [[Rosefinch|rose finches]]. [[Bird of prey|Raptors]] such as [[black eagle]], [[black-winged kite]] and [[kestrel]]s; and [[pheasant]]s such as [[monals]] and [[blood pheasant]] are also found.<ref name="Vegetation"/>

==Economy==
Up to 1962, before the pass was sealed, goods such as pens, watches, cereals, cotton cloth, edible oils, soaps, building materials, and dismantled scooters and four-wheelers were exported to Tibet through the pass on mule-back. Two hundred mules, each carrying about 80 kg (175 lb) of load were used to ferry goods from Gangtok to Lhasa, which used to take 20–25 days. Upon return, silk, raw wool, musk pods, medicinal plants, country liquor, precious stones, gold and silverware were imported into India.<ref name="Historic trade">{{cite web
