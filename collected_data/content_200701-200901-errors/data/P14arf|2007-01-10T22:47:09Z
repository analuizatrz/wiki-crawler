{{lowercase|p14ARF}}

'''p14ARF''' is an alternate reading frame (ARF) product of the [[INK4 gene]]. Both [[p16INK4a]] and p14ARF are involved in [[cell cycle]] regulation. p14ARF inhibits [[mdm2]], thus promoting [[p53]], which promotes [[p21]] activation, which then binds and inactivates certain [[cyclin]]-[[CDK]] complexes, which would otherwise promote [[transcription]] of [[gene]]s that would carry the [[cell (biology)|cell]] through the [[G<sub>1</sub>/S checkpoint]] of the cell cycle.
