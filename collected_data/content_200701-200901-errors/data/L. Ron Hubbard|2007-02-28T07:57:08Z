A controversial public figure, many details of Hubbard's life are contentious. The [[Church of Scientology]] official biographies present Hubbard as "larger than life, attracted to people, liked by people, dynamic, charismatic and immensely capable in a dozen fields".<ref name="LRHsite">[http://www.lronhubbard.org L. Ron Hubbard Site] (accessed 4/15/06)</ref> However, the Church's account of Hubbard's life has changed over time, with editions of the biographical account published over the years differing from each other.<ref>EG, differences in editions of ''What is Scientology?'' noted by Tom Voltz in his book [http://www.lermanet.com/cisar/books/swoe00.htm '''Scientology With(out) an End'''],  pages [http://www.lermanet.com/cisar/books/swoe07.htm 58-59].</ref> 

Biographies of Hubbard by independent journalists and accounts by former Scientologists paint a much less flattering, and often highly critical, picture of Hubbard and in many cases contradict the material presented by the Church.<ref>Corydon, Bent ''[http://www.clambake.org/archive/books/mom/Messiah_or_Madman.txt L.

==Early life==
L. Ron Hubbard was born in 1911 in [[Tilden, Nebraska]]. His father Harry Ross Hubbard was born Henry August Wilson in [[Fayette, Iowa]], but was [[orphan]]ed as an [[infant]] and adopted by the Hubbards, a farming family of [[Fredericksburg, Iowa]]. Harry Ross Hubbard joined the [[United States Navy]] in 1904, leaving the service in 1908, then re-enlisting in 1917 when the United States [[World War I|declared war on Germany]]. He served in the Navy until 1946, reaching the rank of [[Lieutenant-Commander]] in 1934.<ref name="Bare-faced" /><!-- p. 70 -->

His mother Ledora May Hubbard (née Waterbury) was a proto-[[feminist]] who had trained to become a [[high school]] teacher and married Harry in 1909. Her father, Lafayette O. Waterbury (born [[1864]]), was a [[veterinarian]] turned [[coal]] merchant. Her mother, Ida Corinne DeWolfe, was the daughter of affluent banker John DeWolfe. May's paternal grandfather, Abram Waterbury, was from the [[Catskill Mountains]], and later headed West, employed as a [[veterinarian]]. <ref name="Bare-faced" /><!-- p. 8-9 -->

The Hubbards moved first to [[Kalispell, Montana]] and then to [[Helena, Montana|Helena]], the state capital. Church biographies have stated that during this period Hubbard became the protegé of "Old Tom, a Blackfoot Indian medicine man ... [who] passe[d] on much of the tribal lore to his young friend" and that at the age of six, he was "honored with the status of blood brother of the Blackfeet in a ceremony that is still recalled by tribal elders." <ref>"[http://www.scientology.org/html/en_US/l-ron-hubbard/chronicle/index.html L. Ron Hubbard - A Chronicle - 1911-1917]. Accessed 27 Jan 2007</ref> However, contemporary records do not record the existence of "Old Tom". Blackfeet historian Hugh Dempsey has commented that the act of [[blood brother]]hood was "never done among the Blackfeet", and Blackfeet Nation officials have disavowed attempts by Scientologists to "re-establish" Hubbard as a "blood brother" of the Blackfeet.<ref>"Staking a Claim to Blood Brotherhood", ''Los Angeles Times'', 24 June 1990, page A38:5</ref> 

Harry Ross Hubbard's naval career led to the family moving several more times, first to [[San Diego]], then to [[Oakland, California]] followed by [[Puget Sound]] in [[Washington state]] and finally to [[Washington, D.C.]]. During this period L. Ron Hubbard joined the [[Boy Scouts of America]] and became an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] at the age of 13. Church biographies routinely state that he was "the nation's youngest Eagle Scout." <ref name="chronicle01">[http://www.scientology.org/en_US/l-ron-hubbard/chronicle/pg001.html L. Ron Hubbard - A Chronicle - 1918-1921]. Accessed 28 Jan 2007</ref> According to the Boy Scouts of America, however, at the time they only kept an alphabetical record of Eagle Scouts, with no reference to their ages — thus there was no way of telling who was the youngest.<ref name="Bare-faced" /><!-- p. 25 -->

Hubbard later said that while he was in Washington, D.C., he was befriended by Commander [[Joseph Cressman Thompson|Joseph "Snake" Thompson]], who {{interp|had}} recently returned from Vienna and studies with Sigmund Freud. Through the course of their friendship, the commander {{interp|spent}} many an afternoon in the [[Library of Congress]] teaching Ron what he knows of the human mind." <ref name="chronicle01" /> Thompson is an important figure in official Church accounts of Hubbard's life and was referenced in many of Hubbard's works in support of his claims to possess expertise in Freudian [[psychoanalysis]].<ref>See ''inter alia'' Hubbard, "Special Effect Cases, Anatomy Of - Q&A period", lecture of 23 July 1958: "I have made people feel better by using straight Freudian analysis the way I got it from Commander Thompson who imported it to the US Navy"; Hubbard, "Universes", lecture of 6 April 1954: "I was fortunate enough to be trained to some degree by Commander Thompson, who had himself studied with Sigmund Freud"; Hubbard, "The Story of Dianetics and Scientology", lecture of 18 October 1958: "When I was about twelve years old ... I met one of the great men of Freudian analysis - a Commander Thompson ... at the Library of Congress in Washington, DC, where they have all the books on everything, he started shoving my nose into an education in the field of the mind."</ref> Thompson presents a somewhat mysterious figure; Miller, writing in 1986, casts doubt on his existence,<ref name="Bare-faced" /><!-- p. 25 --> though Atack, writing in 1990, cites evidence that he did in fact exist.<ref name="Blue Sky" /><!-- p. 50 --> Both unofficial biographers, however, note that that Hubbard's extensive boy scout diary makes no mention of Thompson or studies at the Library of Congress; Miller comments that during this period, "the most frequent entry in his diary was a laconic 'Was bored'". <ref name="Bare-faced" /><!-- p. 24 -->

Between 1927 and 1929, Hubbard travelled twice to the [[Far East]] to visit his parents during his father's posting to the [[United States Navy]] base on [[Guam]]. Church biographies published from the 1950s to the 1970s stated that with "the financial support of his wealthy grandfather" Hubbard journeyed throughout Asia, "studying with holy men" in northern [[China]],  [[India]] and [[Tibet]].<ref name="certainty">"L. Ron Hubbard", Certainty, vol. 3 no. 2, Hubbard Association of Scientologists International, 1956</ref><ref name="mit">"L. Ron Hubbard - Explorer of Two Realms", in Hubbard, ''Mission into Time'', Advanced Organization Saint Hill Denmark, 1973</ref> Hubbard himself claimed on several occasions to have visited India.<ref>See ''inter alia'' Hubbard, "Case Analysis - Rock Hunting - Q&A Period", lecture of 4 August 1958: "I got over to Asia and India..."; Hubbard, "Universes", lecture of 6 April 1954: "But in the interim [as a boy] I was in India..."; Hubbard, "Mechanics of the Mind", lecture of 10 January 1953: "I struggled along in north China, India and was back in the States and then back out there again."</ref> However, the Church of Scientology's current official account makes no mention of India or Tibet,<ref>[http://www.scientology.org/en_US/l-ron-hubbard/chronicle/pg002.html L. Ron Hubbard - A Chronicle - 1926-1929]. Accessed 28 Jan 2007</ref> and according to [[Jon Atack]] "a flight change at [[Calcutta]] airport in 1959 seems to have been his only direct contact with the land of [[Veda]]ntic philosophy."<ref name="Blue Sky" /><!-- p. 57 -->

==Education==
After graduating from Woodward School for Boys in 1930, Hubbard enrolled at the [[George Washington University]], where he majored in [[civil engineering]]. His grades varied widely, and university records show that he attended for only two years, was on academic probation for his second year, and dropped out in 1932 without a degree. One of his classes was a second-year physics course entitled "Modern Physical Phenomena; Molecular and Atomic Physics", for which he received a grade of "F". Critics point out the difference between Hubbard's educational credentials and his later claims to be a "nuclear physicist".<ref>{{cite book | last = Hubbard | first = L.

==Pulp fiction career==
[[Image:MastersOfSleep.jpg|left|thumb|Cover of October, 1950 edition of ''[[Fantastic Adventures]]'' featuring Hubbard's short story "The Masters of Sleep".]]

Hubbard published many stories and novellas in [[pulp magazine]]s during the 1930s.<ref name="Pulpateer"/> Critics often cite ''Final Blackout'', set in a war-ravaged future Europe, and ''Fear'', a psychological horror story, as the best examples of Hubbard's pulp fiction. 

Among his published stories were ''Sea Fangs'', ''The Carnival of Death'', ''Man-Killers of the Air'', and ''The Squad that Never Came Back''; among the pseudonyms Hubbard used were Rene Lafayette, Legionnaire 148, Lieutenant Scott Morgan, Morgan de Wolf, Michael de Wolf, Michael Keith, Kurt von Rachen, Captain Charles Gordon, Legionnaire 14830, Elron, Bernard Hubbel, Captain B.A. Northrup, Joe Blitz and Winchester Remington Colt.<ref name="Blue Sky">{{cite book | last = Atack | first = Jon | authorlink = Jon Atack | year = 1990 | title = A Piece of Blue Sky | publisher = Carol Publishing Group | location = New York, NY | id = ISBN 0-8184-0499-X}}</ref><!--page 63-65--> He became a well-known author in the [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy fiction|fantasy]] genres; he also published [[westerns]] and adventure stories.

Hubbard's [[metafiction]] novel ''Typewriter in the Sky'', published in 1940 in two installments in [[John W. Campbell]]'s ''[[Unknown (magazine)|Unknown]]'' magazine, provides an amusing insight into the New York writing scene within which Hubbard worked. The novel is centered around a character named Horace Hackett, who is a hyper-productive, multi-genre [[hack writer]] desperately trying to finish his latest [[potboiler]] to an ever-approaching deadline while (unknown to him) his friend Mike de Wolf is trapped inside the potboiler's action. Two of Horace's author friends, in Hubbard's novel, are named Winchester Remington Colt and Rene Lafayette after Hubbard's own pseudonyms.

After leaving the Navy, Hubbard returned to writing fiction briefly for a few years at the end of the 1940s, his best-remembered work from this period being the ''[[Ole Doc Methuselah]]'' series for Campbell's ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'' magazine. It was in the pages of this magazine that the first article on Dianetics appeared; while some fiction works appeared after that (including "Masters of Sleep", which promotes Dianetics and features as a villain "a mad psychiatrist, Doctor Dyhard, who persists in rejecting Dianetics after all his abler colleagues have accepted it {{interp|and}} believes in prefrontal lobotomies for everyone")<ref>{{cite journal | last = Frenschkowski | first = Marco | year = 1999 | month = July | title = L.

Sprague de Camp|de Camp, L. Sprague]]. "[http://www.xenu.net/archive/oca/elron.html El-Ron Of The City Of Brass]".</ref> most of Hubbard's output thereafter was related to Dianetics or Scientology.  Hubbard did not make a major return to fiction again until the 1980s.

Hubbard's 1938 manuscript, ''Excalibur'', contained many concepts and ideas that later turned up in Scientology. However, there is some question as to whether ''Excalibur'' ever really existed.<ref name="cult1" />

Hubbard married [[Margaret Grubb|Margaret "Polly" Grubb]] in 1933, with whom he fathered two children, [[Ronald DeWolf|L. Ron, Jr.]] (1934 &ndash; 1991) and Katherine May (born in 1936). They lived in [[Bremerton, Washington]], during the late 1930s.

==Military career==
In June 1941, with war looming, Hubbard joined the [[United States Navy]] as a [[lieutenant]] junior grade. After the [[Japan]]ese attack on [[Pearl Harbor]] in December 1941, he was posted to [[Australia]] but was returned home, possibly after quarrelling with the US Naval Attaché, who rated him "unsatisfactory for any assignment". 

Subsequently, he was given command of the harbor protection vessel [[USS YP-422|USS ''YP-422'']], based in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. Again, he fell out with his superior officer, who rated him "not temperamentally fitted for independent command."<ref name="Blue Sky"/><!--p. 74--> These statements are in stark contrast with official Scientologist literature, which often portrays Hubbard as a brave and heroic figure during the war.<ref name="MBTR"/><ref>{{cite web| url=http://aboutlronhubbard.org/eng/wis3_1r.htm | title= About the Life Story of L. Ron Hubbard (LRH) The Founder of Scientology continued |accessdate= 2006-07-31 |work=About the Life Story of L.

Hubbard was relieved of command and transferred to a naval school in [[Florida]] where he was trained in anti-submarine warfare. On graduating, he was given command of the newly built subchaser [[USS PC-815|USS ''PC-815'']] (based in [[Astoria, Oregon]]). Shortly after taking the ''PC-815'' on her maiden voyage from Astoria to [[San Diego, California]], his crew detected what he believed to be two Japanese submarines near the mouth of the [[Columbia River]]. 

They spent the next three days bombarding the area with [[depth charge]]s, after which Hubbard claimed at least one Japanese submarine had been sunk. A subsequent investigation by the US Navy concluded Hubbard's vessel had in fact been attacking a "known magnetic deposit" on the seabed, and postwar casualty assessments found no Japanese submarines had been anywhere near the Columbia River at the time. Hubbard accused Admiral [[Frank Jack Fletcher]] of covering up his battle with the "Japanese submarine", which drew an official admonition. 

Shortly after reaching [[San Diego]], Hubbard ordered his crew to practice their gunnery by shelling one of the [[Coronado Islands]], a small [[Mexico|Mexican]] archipelago off the northwest coast of [[Baja California]], in the belief it was uninhabited and belonged to the United States. Neither assumption was correct. The Mexican government complained and following a brief investigation (where it was additionally found that Hubbard had anchored for the night, ignoring orders to return to San Diego at the end of each day), Hubbard was relieved of command with a sharp letter of admonition.

Most of Hubbard's wartime service was spent ashore in the [[continental United States]]. He was mustered out of the active service list in late [[1945]] and continued to draw disability pay for [[arthritis]], [[bursitis]], and [[conjunctivitis]] for years afterwards, long after he claimed to have discovered the secret of how to cure these ailments.  About the time of his discharge, Hubbard was petitioning the [[Veterans Administration]] for psychiatric care to treat "long periods of moroseness and suicidal inclinations." He was also arrested for [[petty theft]] in connection with checks. When he wrote to the FBI that communist spies were after him, an agent attached a note to one of his letters: "Make 'appears mental' card." <ref>[http://www.skeptictank.org/readdig.htm Reader's Digest May 1980 - Scientology]</ref>

In June [[1947]] the Navy attempted to promote him to Lieutenant Commander, but Hubbard appears not to have learned of this and so never accepted it; consequently he remained a Lieutenant.<ref>[http://www.xs4all.nl/~kspaink/cos/warhero/crippled.htm#6 ''Ron the "War Hero"''. Section 3.9, "Crippled and blinded".</ref> He resigned his commission in 1950.

In later years, Hubbard made a number of claims about his military record that do not reconcile with the government's documentation of his service years. For example, Hubbard claimed he had sustained wounds "in combat on the island of [[Java (island)|Java]]",<ref>[http://www.ronthephilosopher.org/page82.htm My Philosophy by L. Ron Hubbard]</ref> but his service record offers no indication he came anywhere near Java, and places him in New York on the day ([[7 December]], [[1941]], the day of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]) he was supposedly landed on Java by a naval destroyer.<ref name="Blue Sky"/><!--p. 71-72--> He also claimed to have received 21 medals and awards, including two [[Purple Heart]]s and a "Unit Citation". The Church of Scientology has circulated a US Navy notice of separation (a form numbered [[DD214]], completed on leaving active duty) as evidence of Hubbard's wartime service. However, the US Navy's copy of Hubbard's DD214 is very different, listing a much more modest record.<ref name="MBTR"/> The Scientology version, signed by a nonexistent Lt. Cmdr. Howard D. Thompson, shows Hubbard being awarded medals that do not exist, boasts academic qualifications Hubbard did not earn, and places Hubbard in command of vessels not in the service of the US Navy. The Navy has noted "several inconsistencies exist between Mr. Hubbard's DD214 [the Scientology version] and the available facts".<ref>[http://www.holysmoke.org/sdhok/war-rec.htm Navy: Official - Hubbard's "record" *is* forged]</ref><ref>[http://www.spaink.net/cos/warhero/medals.htm Ron the War Hero: Hubbard's Medal's]</ref>

==Dianetics==
In May 1950, Hubbard published a book describing the [[self-help|self-improvement]] technique of [[Dianetics]], titled ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]]''. With ''Dianetics,'' Hubbard introduced the concept of "[[auditing (Scientology)|auditing]]", a two-person question-and-answer therapy that focused on painful memories. According to Hubbard, dianetic auditing could eliminate emotional problems, cure physical illnesses, and increase intelligence. In his introduction to ''Dianetics'', Hubbard declared that "the creation of dianetics is a milestone for man comparable to his discovery of fire and superior to his inventions of the wheel and arch."

Unable to elicit interest from mainstream publishers or medical professionals{{Fact|date=January 2007}}, Hubbard turned to the legendary science fiction editor [[John W. Campbell]], who had for years published Hubbard's science fiction . 

Beginning in late 1949, Campbell publicized Dianetics in the pages of ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]''. The science fiction community was divided about the merits of Hubbard's claims. Campbell's star author [[Isaac Asimov]] criticized Dianetics' unscientific aspects, and veteran author [[Jack Williamson]] described Dianetics as "a lunatic revision of [[Freudian]] psychology" that "had the look of a wonderfully rewarding scam." <ref name="Bare-faced"/><!--p.152-153--> But Campbell and novelist [[A. E. van Vogt]] enthusiastically embraced Dianetics: Campbell became Hubbard's treasurer, and van Vogt—convinced his wife's health had been transformed for the better by auditing—interrupted his writing career to run the first Los Angeles Dianetics center.<ref name="Bare-faced"/><!--p.166-->

''Dianetics'' was a hit, selling 150,000 copies within a year of publication.{{Fact|date=January 2007}} Upon becoming more widely available, Dianetics became an object of critical scrutiny by the press and the medical establishment. In September 1950, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published a cautionary statement on the topic by the [[American Psychological Association]] that read in part, "the association calls attention to the fact that these claims are not supported by empirical evidence", and went on to recommend against use of "the techniques peculiar to Dianetics" until such time it had been validated by scientific testing. ''[[Consumer Reports]],'' in an August 1951 assessment of Dianetics,<ref>[http://www.xenutv.com/print/consumer-review-0851.htm Dianetics Review]</ref> dryly noted "one looks in vain in ''Dianetics'' for the modesty usually associated with announcement of a medical or scientific discovery", and stated that the book had become "the basis for a new cult." The article observed "in a study of L. Ron Hubbard's text, one is impressed from the very beginning by a tendency to generalization and authoritative declarations unsupported by evidence or facts." ''Consumer Reports'' warned its readers against the "possibility of serious harm resulting from the abuse of intimacies and confidences associated with the relationship between auditor and patient", an especially serious risk, they concluded, "in a cult without professional traditions."

The Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation was incorporated in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]]. Branch offices were opened in five other US cities before the end of 1950 (though most folded within a year). Hubbard soon abandoned the Foundation, denouncing a number of his former associates as [[communism|communists]] to the FBI.<ref name="Bare-faced"/><!--p.170-->

Hubbard's private behavior became the subject of unflattering headlines when his second wife, Sara Northrup, filed for divorce in late 1950, citing that Hubbard was, unknown to her, still married to his first wife at the time he married Sara. Her divorce papers also accused Hubbard of kidnapping their baby daughter Alexis, and of conducting "systematic torture, beatings, strangulations and scientific torture experiments."<ref>Lattin, Don. [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/02/12/MN115109.DTL "Scientology Founder's Family Life Far From What He Preached"], ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', [[February 12]] [[2001]]</ref>

==Scientology==
{{main|Scientology}}
In mid-1952, Hubbard expanded Dianetics into a secular philosophy which he called [[Scientology]]. That year, Hubbard also married his third wife, [[Mary Sue Whipp]], to whom he remained married for the rest of his life. With Mary Sue, Hubbard fathered four more children— [[Diana Hubbard|Diana]], [[Quentin Hubbard|Quentin]], [[Suzette Hubbard|Suzette]] and [[Arthur Hubbard|Arthur]]—over the next six years.

In December 1953, Hubbard declared Scientology a religion and the first [[Church of Scientology]] was founded in [[Camden, New Jersey]]. He moved to [[England]] at about the same time, and during the remainder of the 1950s he supervised the growing organization from an office in [[London]]. In 1959, he bought [[Saint Hill Manor]] near the [[Sussex, England|Sussex]] town of [[East Grinstead]], a [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] manor house owned by the [[Maharajah]] of [[Jaipur]]. This became the world headquarters of Scientology.

Hubbard claimed to have conducted years of intensive research into the nature of human existence; to describe his findings, he developed an elaborate vocabulary with many newly coined terms.<ref name="glossary">[http://www.scientology.org/gloss.htm The Official Scientology and Dianetics Glossary]</ref> He codified a set of [[Scientology 0-8: The Book of Basics|Scientology axioms]] and an "applied religious philosophy" that promised to improve the condition of the human [[spirit]], which he called the "[[Thetan]]."<ref>[http://www.scientology.org/wis/WISENG/34/34-scax.htm Scientology Axioms]</ref> The bulk of Scientology focuses on the "rehabilitation" of the thetan.

Hubbard's followers believed his "technology" gave them access to their past lives, the traumas of which led to failures in the present unless they were audited. By this time, Hubbard had introduced a biofeedback device to the auditing process, which he called a "Hubbard Electropsychometer" or "[[E-meter]]." It was invented in the 1940s by a [[chiropractor]] and Dianetics enthusiast named [[Volney Mathison]]. This machine, related to the electronic lie detectors of the time, is used by Scientologists in auditing to evaluate "mental masses" surrounding the thetan. These "masses" are claimed to impede the thetan from realizing its full potential.

Hubbard claimed a good deal of physical disease was [[psychosomatic]], and one who, like himself, had attained the enlightened state of "clear" and become an "[[Operating Thetan]]" would be relatively disease free. According to biographers, Hubbard went to great lengths to suppress his recourse to modern medicine, attributing symptoms to attacks by malicious forces, both spiritual and earthly. Hubbard insisted humanity was imperiled by such forces, which were the result of negative memories (or "engrams") stored in the unconscious or "reactive" mind, some carried by the immortal thetans for billions of years. Thus, Hubbard claimed, the only possibility for spiritual salvation was a concerted effort to "clear the planet", that is, to bring the benefits of Scientology to all people everywhere, and attack all forces, social and spiritual, hostile to the interests of the movement.

Church members were expected to pay fixed donation rates for courses, auditing, books and E-meters, all of which proved very lucrative for the Church, which paid emoluments directly to Hubbard and his family.<ref name="Blue Sky"/><!--p. 142--> In a case fought by the Founding Church of Scientology of Washington, D.C. over its tax-exempt status (revoked in 1958 because of these emoluments) the findings of fact in the case included that Hubbard had personally received over $108,000 from the Church and affiliates over a four-year period, over and above the percentage of [[gross income]] (usually 10%) he received from Church-affiliated organizations.<ref name="Foster Report">''Enquiry into the Practice and Effects of Scientology'', Report by Sir John Foster, K.B.E., Q.C., M.P., Published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London December 1971. Cited at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Cowen/audit/fosthome.html .</ref><!--para 118--> However, Hubbard denied such emoluments many times in writing, proclaiming he never received any money from the Church.<ref name="Blue Sky"/><!--p. 204-->

==Legal difficulties and life on the high seas==
[[Scientology controversy|Scientology became a focus of controversy]] across the English-speaking world during the mid-1960s, with the [[United Kingdom]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]], the [[Australia]]n state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and the [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[Ontario]] all holding public inquiries into Scientology's activities.<ref>[http://whyaretheydead.net/Cowen/audit/ofpapers.html Official Papers on Scientology]</ref>

Hubbard left this unwanted attention behind in 1966, when he moved to [[Rhodesia]], following [[Ian Smith]]'s [[Unilateral Declaration of Independence (Rhodesia)|Unilateral Declaration of Independence]]. Attempting to ingratiate himself with the white minority government, he offered to invest large sums in Rhodesia's economy, then hit by UN sanctions, but was asked to leave the country.

In 1967, L. Ron Hubbard further distanced himself from the controversy attached to Scientology by resigning as executive director of the church and appointing himself "[[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]]" of a small fleet of Scientologist-crewed ships that spent the next eight years cruising the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Here, Hubbard formed the religious order known as the "Sea Organization" or "[[Sea Org]]", with titles and uniforms. The Sea Org subsequently became the management group within Hubbard's Scientology empire. 

He was attended by "Commodore's Messengers", teenaged girls dressed in white [[hot pants]] who waited on him hand and foot, bathing and dressing him and even catching the ash from his cigarettes. He had frequent screaming tantrums and instituted brutal punishments such as incarceration in the ship's filthy chain-locker for days or weeks at a time and "overboarding", in which errant crew members were blindfolded, bound and thrown overboard, dropping up to 40 ft. into the cold sea, hoping not to hit the side of the ship with its sharp [[barnacles]] on the way down. These punishments were applied to children as well as to adults [http://www.xenu.net/archive/infopack/8.htm]. He returned to the United States in the mid-1970s and lived for a while in [[Florida]].

In 1977, Scientology offices on both coasts of the United States were raided by [[FBI]] agents seeking evidence of [[Operation Snow White]], a church-run espionage network. Hubbard's wife [[Mary Sue Hubbard|Mary Sue]] and a dozen other senior Scientology officials were convicted in 1979 of conspiracy against the [[United States federal government]], while Hubbard himself was named by federal prosecutors as an "unindicted co-conspirator."<ref name="Burglaries and Lies">{{cite news|author=Robert W. Welkos|coauthors=Joel Sappell|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/la-scientologysidec062490,1,231382.story?coll=la-news-comment |title=Burglaries and Lies Paved a Path to Prison |work=Los Angeles Times |date= 24 June, 1990|accessdate=2006-05-22}}</ref> Facing intense media interest and many subpoenas, he secretly retired to a ranch in tiny Creston, California, north of [[San Luis Obispo, California|San Luis Obispo]].

In 1978, Hubbard was convicted of felony fraud and sentenced to four years in jail and a 35,000₣ fine by a French court. Hubbard refused to serve his jail time or pay his fine and went into hiding.  Hubbard's refusal to talk to British immigration officials about this conviction later caused the British [[Home Office]] to re-affirm an earlier decision to bar him from the UK.<ref>{{cite news |title= Scientology leader is ordered: Stay away|work= [[Daily Mail]]|date= [[1984-07-29]]}}</ref>

In 1984 Justice Latey, ruling<ref>Re: B & G (Minors) (Custody), Delivered in the High Court (Family Division), London, 23 July 1984; judgement transcript available on-line via [http://holysmoke.org/cos/latey.htm HolySmoke.org] and [http://www.xenu.net/archive/audit/latey.html Xenu.net]</ref> in the [[High Court of Justice|High court]] of London, stated in his judgment that Scientology is "dangerous, immoral, sinister and corrupt" and "has its real objective money and power for Mr. Hubbard".<ref name="Blue Sky" /><!-- p. 342 -->  Justice Latey also addressed Hubbard's representation of himself:
<blockquote>
... he has made these, among other false claims:
<br/>
That he was a much decorated war hero. He was not. 
<br/>
That he commanded a corvette squadron. He did not.
<br/>
That he was awarded the Purple Heart, a gallantry decoration for those wounded in action. He was not wounded and was not decorated.
<br/>
That he was crippled and blinded in the war and cured himself with Dianetic technique. He was not crippled and was not blinded.
<br/>
That he was sent by U.S. Naval Intelligence to break up a black magic ring in California. He was not. He was himself a member of that occult group and practiced ritual sexual magic in it.
<br/>
That he was a graduate of George Washington University and an atomic physicist. The facts are that he completed only one year of college and failed the one course on nuclear physics in which he enrolled.
<br/>
There is no dispute about any of this. The evidence is unchallenged.<ref name="Blue Sky" /><!-- p. 339 -->
</blockquote>

A judgment from a court in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] said:

:"Scientology is evil; its techniques are evil; its practice is a serious threat to the community, medically, morally, and socially; and its adherents are sadly deluded and often mentally ill... (Scientology is) the world's largest organization of unqualified persons engaged in the practice of dangerous techniques which masquerade as mental therapy." -- Justice Anderson, [[Supreme Court of Victoria]], [[Australia]].

==Later life==
During the 1980s, Hubbard returned to science fiction, publishing 
''[[Battlefield Earth (novel)|Battlefield Earth]]'' and ''[[Mission Earth (novel)|Mission Earth]]'', the latter being an enormous book, published as a ten volume series. He also wrote an unpublished [[screenplay]] called ''[[xenu|Revolt in the Stars]]'' which dramatizes Scientology's "Advanced Level" teachings. Hubbard's later [[science fiction]] sold well and received mixed reviews, but some press reports describe how sales of Hubbard's books were artificially inflated by Scientologists purchasing large numbers of copies in order to manipulate the bestseller charts.<ref>McIntyre, Mike ([[April 15]], [[1990]]). [http://www.ex-cult.org/Groups/Scientology/sandiego.txt Hubbard Hot-Author Status Called Illusion]. ''San Diego Union'', p. 1.</ref> While claiming to be entirely divorced from the Scientology management, Hubbard continued to draw income from the Scientology enterprises; ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine estimated his 1982 Scientology-related income exceeded US $40 million.

Hubbard died at his ranch on [[24 January]] [[1986]], aged 74, reportedly from a [[stroke]]. He had not been seen in public for the previous five years. Scientology attorneys arrived to claim his body, which they sought to have [[cremation|cremated]] immediately. They were blocked by the [[San Luis Obispo County, California|San Luis Obispo County]] [[medical examiner]], whose examination revealed high levels of a drug called [[hydroxyzine]] (brand name Vistaril), which is sometimes used for its [[antihistamine]] or [[anti-emetic]] properties, and can induce psychoactive side-effects when taken alongside other CNS depressants, such as alcohol or lithium. Despite the fact that hydroxyzine is a standard drug, his prescription with such medication would have been in direct opposition with church of scientology practice and doctrines.<ref>{{cite news | title = Scientology - A Question of Faith | publisher = CBS News | date = 2006-10-28 | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/10/25/48hours/main2124568.shtml | accessdate = 2007-02-22 }}</ref> The Church of Scientology announced Hubbard had deliberately "discarded the body" to do "higher level spiritual research", unencumbered by mortal confines.

In May 1987, [[David Miscavige]], one of Hubbard's former personal assistants, assumed the position of Chairman of the [[Religious Technology Center]] (RTC), a corporation that owns the trademarked names and symbols of Dianetics and Scientology. Although Religious Technology Center is a separate corporation from the Church of Scientology International, Miscavige is the [[ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] leader of the religion. Rev. [[Heber Jentzsch]] is the President of Church of Scientology International.<ref>[http://www.scientology.org/scnnews/jentzsch.htm Heber C. Jentzsch]</ref>

==Controversial episodes==
[[Image:China_text_hubbard.gif|thumb|One of Hubbard's controversial journal entries during his visit to China in 1928]]

L. Ron Hubbard's life is embroiled in controversy, as is the history of Scientology (see [[Scientology controversy]]). His son, [[Ron DeWolf|L. Ron Hubbard, Jr.]] said in a lengthy [[1983]] interview with ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' magazine, DeWolf stated that "99% of anything my father ever wrote or said about himself is untrue." In the same interview, he claimed his father was a [[con man]], a [[Satanist]], a [[KGB]] accomplice, and a drug addict. Scientology, he said, was little more than a [[cult]] that existed to make money<ref>[http://www.lermanet.com/scientologynews/penthouse-LRonHubbardJr-interview-1983.htm Copy of June 1983 Penthouse Magazine]</ref>. DeWolf retracted most of his 1983 statements in an affidavit of 1987{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.

Some documents written by Hubbard himself suggest he regarded Scientology as a business, not a religion. In one letter dated [[April 10]] [[1953]], he says calling Scientology a religion solves "a problem of practical business", and status as a religion achieves something "more equitable...with what we've got to sell". In a 1962 official policy letter, he said "Scientology 1970 is being planned on a religious organization basis throughout the world. This will not upset in any way the usual activities of any organization. It is entirely a matter for accountants and solicitors."<ref>Hubbard Communications Office Policy Letter, HCOPL, 29 October 1962, as cited in {{cite journal | last = Beit-Hallahmi | first = Benjamin | authorlink = Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi | year = 2003 | month = September | title = Scientology: Religion or racket? | journal = Marburg Journal of Religion | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | url = http://web.uni-marburg.de/religionswissenschaft/journal/mjr/beit.html | accessdate = 2007-01-07}}</ref><ref>[http://www.ezlink.com/~perry/CoS/Theology/barwell2.htm Is Scientology a religion? Hubbard says "No".]</ref> A Reader's Digest article of May 1980 quoted Hubbard as saying in the 1940s "Writing for a penny a word is ridiculous. If a man really wants to make a million dollars, the best way would be to start his own religion."<ref>[http://www.skeptictank.org/readdig.htm Anatomy of a Frightening Cult]</ref><ref>[http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1276839 The Heinlein - Hubbard Wager Myth]</ref>

According to ''The Visual Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'', ed. Brian Ash, Harmony Books, 1977:

:"... [Hubbard] began making statements to the effect that any writer who really wished to make money should stop writing and develop [a] religion, or devise a new psychiatric method. [[Harlan Ellison]]'s version (''Time Out'', UK, No 332) is that Hubbard is reputed to have told [[John W. Campbell|{{interpolation|John W.}} Campbell]], "I'm going to invent a religion that's going to make me a fortune. I'm tired of writing for a penny a word." [[Sam Moskowitz]], a chronicler of science fiction, has reported that he himself heard Hubbard make a similar statement, but there is no first-hand evidence".

In a 1983 interview, L. Ron, Jr. said "according to him and my mother" he was the result of a failed abortion and recalls at six years old seeing his father performing an abortion on his mother with a coat hanger. In the same interview, he said "Scientology is a power-and-money-and-intelligence-gathering game" and described his father as "only interested in money, sex, booze, and drugs".<ref>[http://www.lermanet.com/scientologynews/penthouse-LRonHubbardJr-interview-1983.htm Inside The Church of Scientology]</ref>

One controversial aspect of Hubbard's early life revolves around his association with [[Jack Parsons]], an aeronautics professor at [[Caltech]] and an associate of the British [[occultist]] [[Aleister Crowley]]. Hubbard and Parsons were allegedly engaged in the practice of ritual [[magick]] in 1946, including an extended set of sex magick rituals called the [[Babalon Working]], intended to summon a goddess or "moonchild." (Among occultists today, it is widely accepted that Hubbard derived a large part of 'Dianetics' from [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|Golden Dawn]] occult ideas such as the [[Holy Guardian Angel]].) The Church insists Hubbard was a US government intelligence agent on a mission to end Parsons' magickal activities and to "rescue" a girl Parsons was "using" for magickal purposes. Critics dismiss these claims as after-the-fact rationalizations.  Crowley recorded in his notes that he considered Hubbard a "lout" who made off with Parsons' money and girlfriend in an "ordinary confidence trick".<ref name="Bare-faced" /><!-- p. 126 --><ref name="Blue Sky" /><!-- p. 98-99 -->

Hubbard later married the girl he said that he rescued, Sara Northrup. This marriage was an act of [[bigamy]], as Hubbard had abandoned, but not divorced, his first wife and children as soon as he left the Navy (he divorced his first wife more than a year after he had remarried).<ref name="Blue Sky" /><!-- p. 101 --> Both women allege Hubbard [[domestic violence|physically abused]] them. He is also alleged to have once kidnapped Sara's infant, Alexis, taking her to [[Cuba]]. Later, he disowned Alexis, claiming she was actually Jack Parsons' child. <!---this paragraph needs dates and better documentation-->

Hubbard had another son in 1954, [[Quentin Hubbard]], who was groomed to one day replace him as the head of the Scientology. <ref>[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Library/Shelf/atack/bs4-6.htm A Piece of Blue Sky], pp. 213-214</ref> However, Quentin was deeply depressed, allegedly because he was homosexual and his father was [[homophobic]], and wanted to leave Scientology and become a pilot.<ref>{{cite news | title = Secret Lives: L. Ron Hubbard | publisher = Channel 4 (England) | date = 1997-11-19 | url = http://www.xenutv.com/int/secretlives.htm | accessdate = 2007-02-22}}</ref> As Scientology rejects homosexuality as a sexual perversion and views mental health professionals and the drugs they can prescribe as fraudulent and oppressive, Quentin had no avenues available to deal with his depression. Quentin attempted suicide in 1974 and then died in 1976 under mysterious circumstances that might have been a suicide or a murder.

Hubbard has been interpreted as both a savior (Scientologists refer to him as "The Friend of Mankind") and a con-artist. These sharply contrasting views have been a source of hostility between Hubbard supporters and critics. A California court judgment in 1984 involving [[Gerry Armstrong|Gerald Armstrong]], who had been assigned the task of writing Hubbard's biography, highlights the extreme opposition of the two sides. The judgment quotes a 1970's police agency of the French Government and says in part:

:"In addition to violating and abusing its own members' civil rights, the organization [Scientology] over the years with its "[[Fair Game (Scientology)|Fair Game]]" doctrine has harassed and abused those persons not in the Church whom it perceives as enemies. The organization clearly is schizophrenic and paranoid, and the bizarre combination seems to be a reflection of its founder LRH [L. Ron Hubbard]. The evidence portrays a man who has been virtually a pathological liar when it comes to his history, background, and achievements. The writings and documents in evidence additionally reflect his egoism, greed, avarice, lust for power, and vindictiveness and aggressiveness against persons perceived by him to be disloyal or hostile. At the same time it appears that he is charismatic and highly capable of motivating, organizing, controlling, manipulating, and inspiring his adherents." -- Superior Court Judge Paul Breckinridge, ''Church of Scientology of California vs. Gerald Armstrong,'' [[June 20]], [[1984]].<ref>[http://www.planetkc.com/sloth/sci/breck.html Breckenridge Decision]</ref>

"Fair Game" was introduced by Hubbard, and incites Scientologists to use criminal behavior, deception and exploitation of the legal system to resist "[[Suppressive Person]]s", i.e. people or groups that "actively seeks to suppress or damage Scientology or a Scientologist by Suppressive Acts". He defined it "Fair Game" as:

''ENEMY — SP Order. Fair game. May be deprived of property or injured by any means by any Scientologist without any discipline of the Scientologist. May be tricked, sued or lied to or destroyed''.

The Church of Scientology today says that it has removed those policies from its doctrine and it is no longer in existence, but this statement is just as vigorously contested by its critics. (See [[Fair Game (Scientology)]] for a more detailed examination.)

Conflicting interpretations of Hubbard's life are presented in the online version of Russell Miller's biography of Hubbard, ''Bare Faced Messiah''; this largely critical version includes links to Scientology's official accounts of Hubbard's past, embedded within Miller's description of the same history.

Several issues surrounding Hubbard's death and disposition of his estate are also subjects of controversy &mdash; a swift cremation with no [[autopsy]]; the destruction of coroner's photographs; coroner's evidence of the drug [[Hydroxyzine|Vistaril]] present in Hubbard's blood; questions about the whereabouts of Dr. Eugene Denk (Hubbard's physician) during Hubbard's death, and the changing of wills and trust documents the day before his death, resulting in the bulk of Hubbard's estate being transferred not to his family, but to Scientology.

Hubbard sometimes displayed racist attitudes that were at odds with the picture his followers try to present of him.  For instance, when Hubbard visited China at the age of seventeen, he made diary entries such as: "As a [[Chinaman]] can not live up to a thing, he always drags it down."<ref name="Bare-faced" /><!-- p. 41 --> and "They smell of all the baths they didnt {{sic}} take. The trouble with China is, there are too many chinks here."<ref name="Bare-faced" /><!--p. 42--><ref>[http://www.xs4all.nl/~kspaink/cos/LRH-bio/chinamen.htm The problem with Chinamen], L. Ron Hubbard, Journal entries in 1928</ref> Similarly, Hubbard described the Lama temples as "miserably cold and very shabby . . . The people worshipping have voices like bull-frogs and beat a drum and play a brass horn to accompany their singing (?)"<ref name="Bare-faced"/><!--p. 42--> and called them "very odd and heathenish".<ref name="MBTR"/> He also wrote about [[colored]] people: "Unlike the yellow and brown people, the white does not usually believe he can get attention from matter or objects. The yellow and brown believe for the most part ... that rocks, trees, walls, etc., can give them attention"<ref>Hubbard, L. Ron, ''Scientology: Fundamentals of Thought''. Copenhagen: New Era Publications, 1997. ISBN 1900944979, p. 24</ref> and "...so we see the African tribesman, with his complete contempt for the truth, and his emphasis on brutality and savagery..."<ref>Hubbard, L. Ron, ''Scientology: Fundamentals of Thought''. Copenhagen: New Era Publications, 1997. ISBN 1900944979, p. 77</ref>

While such attitudes might not be especially surprising for a teenager born in 1911, they are vastly at odds with the stories he would later tell and his followers would repeat: "Among other wonders, Ron told of watching monks meditate for weeks on end, contemplating higher truths ... he took advantage of this unique opportunity to study Far Eastern culture. ... he befriended and learned ... a thoroughly insightful Beijing magician who represented the last of the line of Chinese magicians from the court of Kublai Khan.  ... Old Mayo was also well versed in China’s ancient wisdom that had been handed down from generation to generation. Ron passed many evenings in the company of such wise men, eagerly absorbing their words ... he closely examined the surrounding culture. In addition to the local Tartar tribes, he spent time with nomadic bandits originally from Mongolia ... [t]hese sojourns in Asia and the Pacific islands had a profound effect, giving Ron a subjective understanding of Eastern philosophy ... the world itself was his classroom, and he studied in it voraciously, recording what he saw and learned in his ever-present diaries, which he carefully preserved for future reference."<ref name="WiS98">{{cite book | author = Compiled by staff of the Church of Scientology International | year = 1998 | title = What is Scientology? | edition=1998 | publisher = Bridge Publications, Inc. | location = Los Angeles, California | id = ISBN 1-57318-122-6}}</ref><!--p.30-32--><ref>{{cite web| url=http://lron.hubbard.org/pg003.html |title=1923-1929: On the road to discovery |work=L.

Similarly, L. Ron Hubbard expressed support for [[apartheid]] measures in [[South Africa]]:  "Having viewed slum clearance projects in most major cities of the world may I state that you have conceived and created in the Johannesburg townships what is probably the most impressive and adequate resettlement activity in existence."<ref>L. Ron Hubbard in a letter to [[Hendrik Frensch Verwoerd]] (widely considered to be the architect of South Africa’s apartheid system) dated [[November 7]], [[1960]], reprinted in K.T.C. Kotzé, ''Inquiry Into the Effects and Practices of Scientology'', p. 59, Pretoria 1973; online copy of the Kotzé report available as [http://www.solitarytrees.net/pubs/kotze/html/03-05.htm html] and [http://www.solitarytrees.net/pubs/kotze/kotze1.pdf PDF]</ref>

==Hubbard in popular culture==
{{main|List of Scientology references in popular culture}}

L. Ron Hubbard has been depicted in novels, motion pictures, television cartoons, video games and other cultural forms.  Though Hubbard turns up in a fellow pulp author's fiction as early as 1942 <ref> Anthony Boucher's 1942 murder mystery ''Rocket to the Morgue'' features cameos by members of the "Mañana Literary Society of Southern California", in which Hubbard makes a dual appearance as D. Vance Wimpole and Rene Lafayette (one of his pen names). </ref>, his fame increased greatly after the introduction of Dianetics and Scientology, and he has continued to be a popular subject since the time of his death. 

Hubbard was awarded the 1994 [[Ig Nobel Prize]] in Literature for "his crackling Good Book, ''Dianetics,'' which is highly profitable to mankind — or to a portion thereof".<ref>http://improbable.com/ig-pastwinners.html#ig1994</ref> The presenter observed he was also the most prolific posthumous author that year.

==Bibliography==
{{main|L. Ron Hubbard bibliography|Scientology bibliography}}

Hubbard was an unusually prolific author and lecturer. Because the majority of Hubbard's writings of the 1950s through to the 1970s were aimed exclusively at Scientologists, the Church of Scientology founded its own companies to publish his works - [[Bridge Publications]] for the US and Canadian market and [[New Era Publications]], based in [[Denmark]], for the rest of the world. New volumes of his transcribed lectures continue to be produced; that series alone will ultimately total a projected 110 large volumes. Hubbard also wrote a number of works of fiction during the 1930s and 1980s, which are published by the Scientology-owned [[Galaxy Press]]. All three of these publishing companies are subordinate to [[Author Services Inc.]], another Scientology corporation.
