The '''Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis''' (also known as the '''Federation of Saint Christopher and Nevis'''<ref>Both the names Saint Christopher and Saint Kitts are given in the [http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Kitts/kitts83.html Constitution of Saint Christopher and Nevis].</ref>), located in the [[Leeward Islands]], is a federal two-island nation in the [[West Indies]]. It is the smallest nation in the Americas, in both [[List of countries by area|area]] and [[List of countries by population|population]]. 

The capital city and headquarters of government for the federated state is on the larger island of [[Saint Kitts]]. The smaller state of [[Nevis]] lies about 2 miles (3 km) southeast of Saint Kitts, across a shallow channel called "The Narrows".  

Historically, the [[United Kingdom|British]] dependency of [[Anguilla]] was also a part of this union, which was then known collectively as [[Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla]]. 

Saint Kitts and Nevis are geographically part of the Leeward Islands. To the north-northwest lie the islands of [[Saint Eustatius]], [[Saba]], [[Saint Barthélemy]], and [[Saint Martin|Saint-Martin/Sint Maarten]]. To the northeast are [[Antigua and Barbuda]], and to the southeast is the small uninhabited island of [[Redonda]], and the island of [[Montserrat]], which currently has an active [[volcano]].

Saint Kitts and Nevis were amongst the first islands in the Caribbean to be settled by Europeans. Saint Kitts was home to the first British and French colonies in the [[Caribbean]]. 

Saint Kitts and Nevis is the smallest nation on Earth to ever host a [[World Cup| World Cup event]]; it was one of the host venues of the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]].

==Etymology==

Saint Kitts was named '[[Mount Liamuiga|Liamuiga]]' by the Kalinago Indians who inhabited the island. This name, roughly translated in English means 'fertile land,' a testimony to the island's rich volcanic soil and high productivity. Nevis was named 'Oualie', which translates to 'land of beautiful waters,' presumably referred to the island's freshwater springs, hot volcanic springs, and clear blue seas. 

Christopher Columbus, upon arriving at what we now call Nevis in 1498, gave that island the name ''San Martin'' (Saint Martin). However, the confusion of numerous, poorly-charted small islands in the Leeward Island chain, meant that the name ended up being accidentally transferred to another island, the one which we now know as the French/Dutch island [[Saint Martin|Saint-Martin/Sint Maarten]]. The name ''Nevis'' is derived from a Spanish name ''Nuestra Señora de las Nieves'', by a process of abbreviation and [[anglicization]]. This Spanish name means [[Our Lady of the Snows (liturgical feast)|Our Lady of the Snows]]. It is not known who chose this name for the island, but it is a reference to the story of a 4th century Catholic miracle: a snowfall on a mountain near Rome. Presumably the white clouds which usually wreathe the top of Nevis Peak reminded someone of the story of a miraculous snowfall in a hot climate. The island of Nevis, upon first British settlement was referred to as "Dulcina", a name meaning "sweet one". Its original Spanish name, "Nuestra Señora de las Nieves," was eventually kept however, though it was soon shortened to "Nevis".

There is some disagreement over the name which Columbus gave to St. Kitts. For many years it was thought that he named the island ''San Cristobal'', after his patron saint [[Saint Christopher]], the saint of travelling. However, new studies suggest that Columbus named the island ''Sant Jago'' (Saint James). The name "San Cristobal" was apparently given by Columbus to the island we now know as Saba, 20 miles northwest. It seems that "San Cristobal" came to be applied to the island of St. Kitts only as the result of a mapping error. No matter the origin of the name, the island was well documented as "San Cristobal" by the 17th century. The first British colonists kept the English translation of this name, and dubbed it "St. Christopher's island." In the 17th century Kit, or Kitt, was a common abbreviation for the name Christopher, and so the island was often informally referred to as "Saint Kitt's island," which was further shortened to "Saint Kitts."

==History==
{{main|History of Saint Kitts and Nevis}}

The islands of Saint Kitts and Nevis are two of the Caribbean's oldest colonised territories. Saint Kitts became the first British colony in the West Indies in 1624 and then became the first French colony in the Caribbean in 1625, when both nations decided to partition the island.

Five thousand years prior to European arrival, the island was settled by Indian peoples. The latest arrivals, the [[Kalinago]] peoples, arrived approximately 3 centuries before the Europeans. The Kalinago allowed the Europeans to colonize Saint Kitts, while earlier attempts to settle other islands were met with immediate destruction of the colonies by the Indians. The Kalinago were eventually wiped out in the great [[Kalinago Genocide of 1626]]. 

The island of Nevis was colonized in 1628 by British settlers from Saint Kitts. From there, Saint Kitts became the premier base for British and French expansion, as the islands of [[Antigua]], [[Montserrat]], [[Anguilla]] and [[Tortola]] for the British, and [[Martinique]], the [[Guadeloupe]] archipelago and [[St. Barths]] for the French were colonized from it.

Although small in size, and separated by only {{convert|2|mi|km|0}} of water, the two islands were viewed and governed as different states until the late 19th century, when they were forcefully unified along with the island of Anguilla by the British. To this day relations are strained, with Nevis accusing Saint Kitts of neglecting its needs.

Saint Kitts and Nevis, along with [[Anguilla]], became an [[Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla|associated state]] with full internal autonomy in 1967. Angullians rebelled, and their island was allowed to separate from the others in 1971. St. Kitts and Nevis achieved independence in 1983. It is the newest sovereign nation in the Americas. In August 1998, a vote in Nevis on a referendum to separate from St. Kitts fell short of the two-thirds majority needed. In late September 1998, [[Hurricane Georges]] caused approximately $445 million in damages and limited [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] growth for the year.

[[Alexander Hamilton]], the first United States Secretary of the Treasury, was born in Nevis; he spent his childhood there and on [[St. Croix]], then belonging to [[Denmark]], and now one of the [[United States Virgin Islands]].

== Geography ==
[[Image:Sc-map.png|thumb|Map of Saint Kitts and Nevis]]
{{main|Geography of Saint Kitts and Nevis}}
{{seealso|List of cities in Saint Kitts and Nevis}}
The country has two main islands, [[Saint Kitts]] and [[Nevis]]. The highest peak, at 1,156 [[metre]]s, is [[Mount Liamuiga]].

The islands are of [[volcanic]] origin, with large central peaks covered in [[tropical rainforest]]; the steeper slopes leading to these peaks are mostly uninhabited. The majority of the population on both islands lives closer to the sea where the terrain flattens out. There are numerous [[rivers]] descending from the mountains of both islands, which provide fresh water to the local population.  St. Kitts also has one small [[lake]].

== Economy ==
[[Image:Stkitts-view-lookingatsea.jpg|right|thumb|200px|View of Nevis. Salt pond at right.]]
{{main|Economy of Saint Kitts and Nevis}}


Saint Kitts and Nevis is very small for a country. It is 1 1/2 times the size of Washington D.C.  Saint Kitts and Nevis is a twin-island federation whose economy is characterized by its dominant tourism, agriculture and light manufacturing industries. Sugar was the primary export from the 1640s on, but rising production costs, low world market prices, and the government's efforts to reduce dependence on it have led to a growing diversification of the agricultural sector. In 2005, the government decided to close down the state-owned sugar company, which had caused losses and was a significant contributor to the fiscal deficit. Former sugar plantations still dominate the St. Kitts landscape. The agricultural, tourism, export-oriented manufacturing, and offshore-banking sectors are being developed and are now taking larger roles in the country’s economy. The growth of the tourism sector has become the main foreign exchange earner for Saint Kitts and Nevis. The country has also developed a successful apparel assembly industry and one of the largest electronics assembly industries in the Caribbean.

During the 1990s, Saint Kitts and Nevis registered an annual GDP growth of 5.5 percent, but the strong growth was interrupted by devastating hurricanes in 1998 and 1999. Post-hurricane reconstruction led to an economic resumption in 2000 with GDP growing 6.2 percent. The year 2001 began well enough although the post-hurricane construction boom was over and growth was slowing from its 2000 rate. But after September 11, tourism arrivals dropped off precipitously and activity in related sectors of the economy such as road construction and retail sales declined along with tourism. As a result, the GDP growth declined substantially in 2001 and 2002. Economic activity has recovered since 2003, mainly driven by strong growth in tourism. In view of its high level of public debt, the country needs a prudent fiscal policy to ensure sustainable economic growth.
