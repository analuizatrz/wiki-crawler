'''Ian McDiarmid''' (born [[August 11]], [[1944]]) is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[actor]] born in [[Carnoustie, Angus|Carnoustie]]. He has had a successful career in theatre; he has been cast in many plays, while occasionally directing others. From 1990 until 2001, he served with [[Jonathan Kent (director)|Jonathan Kent]] as artistic director of the now prestigious [[Almeida Theatre]], thanks largely to both their efforts. 

Although McDiarmid's passion lies chiefly in theatrical productions, he has also accepted roles in theatrical films and TV movies. He is most famous for his role as [[Palpatine]], a cunning politician who eventually becomes Emperor of the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]]; in both the [[original trilogy (Star Wars)|original]] and [[prequel trilogy|prequel]] ''[[Star Wars]]'' trilogies.

Currently, McDiarmid is playing the part of [[Satan]] in the [[BBC7]] Radio Play based on [[John Milton]]'s [[Paradise Lost]] <ref name=PLost>{{cite web |author= John Milton |title=Paradise Lost|date=2006-11-26 | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbc7/listenagain/sunday/rams/0800.ram | accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref>.

==Early life and education==

McDiarmid's love of the theatre began when he was only five years old, on the day his father took him to see an act by the name of ''Tommy Morgan'' in a theatre located in [[Dundee]]. According to McDiarmid:  
{{Cquote|It sort of fascinated me, and it also scared me. All those lights, all that make-up. I said to myself, 'I don't know what this is, but I want it.'<ref name=Simonchange>{{cite web |author= Simon Hattenstone |title=Force for change |date=2001-12-17 |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,620076,00.html |accessdate=2006-08-27}}</ref>}}

However, fearing that his father wouldn't approve of his aspiration to be an actor, McDiarmid attended the [[University of St Andrews]], where he received a degree in [[psychology]], as well as an [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|M.A.]] in [[social science]].<ref name=Simonchange/> Soon after, he decided to pursue a career in the theatre instead, and took acting training courses at the [[Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama]] in [[Glasgow]]. In 1968, McDiarmid received a gold medal for his work. This would later prove to be the first of many recognitions given to him for outstanding work in the theatre. McDiarmid claimed he became its recipient "by doing all the boring jobs you have to do when you are young, to eke out an existence."<ref>[http://www.nerf-herders-anonymous.net/IanMcDiarmid.html/ Star Wars Actors Database at Nerf-Herders-Anonymous.net]; last accessed [[August 23]] [[2006]].</ref>

==Theatrical work==
McDiarmid is renowned for his work in [[United Kingdom|British]] theatre, having won plaudits as an actor and director from a wide variety of sources. 
He has starred in a variety of [[Shakespearean]] plays including [[Hamlet]] (1972), [[The Tempest]] (1974, 2000), [[Much Ado About Nothing]] (1976), [[The Merchant of Venice]] (1984), and [[King Lear]] (2005). While at the Almedia he directed plays such as [[Venice Preserv'd]] (1986) and [[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]] (1991).<ref name="IanBroadway"> Ian McDiarmid's stage credits at [http://www.broadway.com/gen/Buzz_Star_File.aspx?ci=531308 Broadway.com]; last accessed [[November 27]] [[2006]].</ref> 

In 2001, McDiarmid won Almedia Theatre's Critics Circle Award for Best Actor for his role as Teddy in a [[Revival (play)|revival]] of [[Brian Friel]]'s ''[[Faith Healer|The Faith Healer]]''. Five years later in 2006, he reprised this role in his debut on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].<ref name=HorwitzNewRole>{{cite web |author=Simi Horwitz |title=The Emperor's New Role |date=2001-9-5 |work=BackStage |url=http://backstage.com/bso/news_reviews/features/feature_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002577371&imw |accessdate=2006-10-24}}</ref> Directed by Kent, he performed alongside [[Ralph Fiennes]] and [[Cherry Jones]], and won the [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Play]].<ref name="IanHollywood"> Ian McDiarmid at [http://www.hollywood.com/celebs/fulldetail/id/195431 Hollywood.com]; last accessed [[October 23]] [[2006]].</ref>

One theatrical performance of note is his portrayal of the lead character Harry Hackamore in [[Sam Shepard]]'s play ''Seduced''. By McDiarmid's own description, Hackamore was a [[Howard Hughes]]-type character. To play the part, he was made-up in prosthetics, including a false beard and long fingernails, to resemble Hackamore. McDiarmid was only 37 at the time, and this convinced [[George Lucas]] and [[Richard Marquand]] that he could convincingly play a much older character in extreme cinematic close-up, which helped him land the role of Palpatine.<ref name=IanDatabase>[http://imdb.com/name/nm0001519/bio Ian McDiarmid at the Internet Movie Database]; last accessed [[August 26]] [[2006]].</ref>

===Almeida Theatre===

From 1990 until 2001, McDiarmid and Jonathan Kent served as the artistic directors of the Almeida Theatre, located in the [[Islington]] district of [[London]]. In 1998 they shared the Special Evening Standard Award for Theatrical Achievement of the Year.<ref name="IanHollywood"/> Their tenure was marked by a string of highly successful performances involving 'big name' actors usually seen in films such as [[Kevin Spacey]] and [[Ralph Fiennes]].<ref name=GibbonsCelebrated>{{cite web |author=Fiachra Gibbons |title=Celebrated double act quits Almeida theatre |date=2001-9-5 |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,546925,00.html |accessdate=2006-10-23}}</ref>

==Work in Star Wars==

{{further|[[Palpatine#Ian McDiarmid|Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine]]}}
After a minor part in the film ''[[Dragonslayer]]'', McDiarmid was cast by George Lucas in ''[[Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi|Return of the Jedi]]'' as Emperor Palpatine, the principal villain. Sixteen years after appearing in ''Return of the Jedi'', he reprised the role as a younger Senator and [[Supreme Chancellor|Chancellor]] in the ''Star Wars'' prequel films.  McDiarmid has the distinction of being the only ''Star Wars'' actor to reprise his role of a human character, an opportunity that he attributes to having been so much younger than his character the first time he played the part. 

The prequels had him play two faces to his character; He re-created his diabolical interpretation of the character from ''Return of the Jedi'' when playing [[Darth Sidious]], the Chancellor's [[Sith Lord]] [[alter ego]], but created a more attractive, pleasant, and seductive character in playing Palpatine's public persona. While he had previously achieved little recognition for this role, except from fans, due to the extensive prostetics used for the character which made him unrecognizable, he received widespread attention and critical acclaim for his expanded role in the prequels.<ref name=IanHollywood/> 

In the [[List of changes in Star Wars re-releases#2004 Star Wars trilogy|2004 re-release]] of ''[[Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back|The Empire Strikes Back]]'', a brief scene between [[Darth Vader]] and a [[hologram]] of Emperor Palpatine was updated to have him depicted by McDiarmid (the Emperor was originally voiced by [[Clive Revill]] for that scene and the face on the projector was that of a woman wearing prosthetic makeup and chimpanzee eyes replacing normal human ones).<ref name="PalpatineDatabank">Palpatine, at the [http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/palpatine/?id=bts/ Star Wars Databank]; last accessed [[October 22]], [[2006]].</ref> With this addition to ''The Empire Strikes Back'', McDiarmid has now appeared in every film version in which Palpatine appears.
