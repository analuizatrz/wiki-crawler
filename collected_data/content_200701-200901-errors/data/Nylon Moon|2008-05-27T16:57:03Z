'''Nylon Moon''' was a [[dream house]] production team formed by [[Daniele Maffei]] (aka Daniele Gas) and [[Michele Generale]]. Their biggest hit was "Sky Plus", a piano-driven track which was one of the major dream house hits during the mid-nineties, reaching number 43 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in April [[1996]]. 
Other singles followed after this, although none reached the same degree of popularity. At some point, an album was released: ''Heartage''. Soon after, dream house music lost its popular appeal and evolved into melodic trance, and many artists from this era, including Nylon Moon, disappeared or moved on to new projects.
