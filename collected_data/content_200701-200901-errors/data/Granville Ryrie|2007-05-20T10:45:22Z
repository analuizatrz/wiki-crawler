'''Sir Granville de Laune Ryrie''', [[Order of St Michael and St George|KCMG]], [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Volunteer Decoration|VD]] ([[1 July]] [[1865]] &ndash; [[2 October]] [[1937]]) was an Australian soldier and politician who served in the [[Second Boer War]] and the [[First World War]].

Ryrie was born in [[Michelago, New South Wales]] on [[1 July]] [[1865]], into a farming family. He became a [[stockman|jackaroo]], and eventually managed his own property. In [[1896]] he married Mary, whom Ryrie nicknamed Mick.

Ryrie volunteered to serve in the [[Second Boer War]], from [[1899]] to [[1902]]. He was selected to serve in one of the Bushmen's Contingents, groups of [[light horse|light horsemen]], because of his skills on horseback and in shooting. During the war he was promoted to the position of honorary Major.

In [[1906]], Ryrie was elected to the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly]] for the [[electoral district of Queanbeyan]], where he served until [[1910]]. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the [[Australian House of Representatives]] at the [[Australian legislative election, 1910|1910 election]], but was successfully elected to the [[Division of North Sydney]] at a by-election on [[11 March]] [[1911]], following the death of Hon [[George Edwards (Australian politician)|George Edwards]].

At the beginning of the [[First World War]], Ryrie was promoted to Brigadier-General, and was given command of the [[Australian 2nd Light Horse Brigade]], part of the [[Anzac Mounted Division]]. He joined the [[Battle of Gallipoli]] on  [[19 May]] [[1915]], where he was wounded twice. He was later moved to [[Egypt]] and [[London]] for respite, but rejoined the Brigade for the [[Sinai and Palestine campaign]]. He was involved in the famous charge of the light horse in the [[Third Battle of Gaza]], in which Australian forces [[Battle of Beersheba|captured the town of Beersheba]]. In December [[1918]] he was made commander of the [[Australian Mounted Division]], and in April [[1919]] was put in charge of the [[Australian Imperial Force]]. He was promoted [[major general]] in September.

After returning to Australia, Ryrie remained the Member for North Sydney. In [[1920]], he was made an Assistant Minister for Defence in the [[Fifth Hughes Ministry|ministry]] of [[Billy Hughes]], assisting Senator [[George Pearce]]. At the [[Australian legislative election, 1922|1922 election]] he was elected to the newly created [[Division of Warringah]], where he served until [[1927]], when he was appointed Australia's High Commissioner to the [[United Kingdom]] in [[London]]. He was also an Australian delegate to the [[League of Nations]].

Ryrie returned to Australia in [[1932]], and died in [[Sydney]] on [[2 October]] [[1937]].

Micalago Station is still in the Ryrie family and is run by David Ryrie, Granvilles eldest grandson. David and his family still reside in the original homestead.

Ryrie Street in [[North Ryde]], Australia is named in his honour.
