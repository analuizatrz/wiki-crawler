In the order in which they occur in the storyline (and when they occur): 
* ''[[Without Remorse]]'' (1970–1971)
* ''[[Patriot Games]]'' (circa 1980. Ryan states in ''The Cardinal of the Kremlin'' these events happen "5 years ago".)

* ''[[The Cardinal of the Kremlin]]'' (circa 1985)

Starting with the following novel, the ''Ryanverse'' becomes distinctly different from real history as noted below.

* ''[[Clear and Present Danger]]'' (1986) - "The President" is referred to as distinct from [[Ronald Reagan]], but events in Cardinal of the Kremlin are referred to as having concluded less than a year before the start of the novel, which takes place during an election year. Setting "Cardinal of the Kremlin" in 1991 misplaces the state of US-Soviet relations, and 1984 is before the drug war warranted the attention given in "Clear and Present Danger." The election cycle must be off, and years in the late 1980s disappear.
* ''[[The Sum of All Fears]]'' (1973 and 1990) – [[Israel]] cedes [[Jerusalem]] to the [[Vatican]] and [[Saudi Arabia]], which makes Jerusalem a UN-policed protectorate. Residents of Jerusalem can choose between either Vatican, Saudi or Israeli judicial law. [[Denver]] is devastated by a terrorist nuclear explosion.
* ''[[Debt of Honor]]'' (Takes place two years after The Sum of All Fears) — After crippling the US economy, [[Japan]] invades and retakes the [[Marianas Islands]]; the [[US]] and [[Russia]] destroy all of their [[nuclear missiles]]; the US and Japan fight a brief war, which the Japanese lose; Japan becomes a nuclear power; an embittered Japanese pilot and proponent of the war crashes a 747 into the US [[Capitol Building]] during Ryan's confirmation hearing for the [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], killing most of the House and Senate, the [[POTUS|President]], all nine Supreme Court justices, the senior military establishment (including the JCS), and most of the Cabinet; Ryan is left in charge of a gutted government.
* ''[[Executive Orders]]'' (Starts at the same day as Debt of Honor's ending and ends weeks after) — [[Saddam Hussein]] is [[assassinated]]; [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]] merge forming the [[United Islamic Republic]]; the UIR launches a biological attack on the US using the [[Ebola]] [[virus]]; the US launches the Second Persian Gulf War against the UIR and defeats them; the Ayatollah is killed in a smart-bomb attack by the US.
* ''[[Rainbow Six (novel)|Rainbow Six]]'' (Takes place between Executive Orders and The Bear and the Dragon) RAINBOW - an elite counter-terrorist force - is created and engages [[terrorists]] across [[Europe]]. [[Ecoterrorist|Ecoterrorists]] plan to create a genetically-enhanced [[virus]] based off of [[Ebola]] and [[cancer]] cells, which they plan to use to wipe out much of the world's population.
* ''[[The Bear and the Dragon]]'' (Takes place one year after Executive Orders) – [[Russia]] is admitted to NATO; [[China]] and [[Russia]] fight a major war, in which the US intervenes on their [[NATO]] ally's side. It mentions the [[British Prime Minister]] and infers that it is [[Tony Blair]].
* ''[[The Teeth of the Tiger]]'' (circa 2003-2005, based on the age of Jack Ryan Jr.)
