The '''Alameda County Water District''' ('''ACWD''') is a public agency in [[Alameda County, California]], [[USA]], which has responsibilities for managing and protecting certain [[groundwater]] resources within Alameda County.  While not an administrative unit of the county government, this water district derives certain of its authorities from the County of Alameda.  In particular, much of the work of the ACWD relates to management of the [[Niles Cone]] [[aquifer]].  
(ACWD, 2007)  Some of the work of the ACWD is regional in nature, coordinating with water management agencies of the [[San Francisco Peninsula]] and [[Santa Clara Valley Water District]].
(S.F. Bay, 2003)  The Alameda County Water Agency receives grant funding from such agencies as the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] and State of California Department of Water Resources, for the purposes of technical assessment of the [[Niles Cone]] and other [[hydrological]] features of its jurisdictional area.. Specific capital programs of the ACWD include the construction of water supply [[pipeline]]s, monitoring wells and blending facilities.(Earth Metrics Inc, 1990)
