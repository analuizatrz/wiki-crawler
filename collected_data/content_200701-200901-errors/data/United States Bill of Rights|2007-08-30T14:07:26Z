The '''United States Bill of Rights''' consists of the first 10 [[constitutional amendment|amendments]] to the [[United States Constitution]]. These amendments limit the powers of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]], protecting the rights of all citizens, residents and visitors on United States territory. Among the enumerated rights these amendments guarantee are: the [[freedom of speech|freedoms of speech]], [[freedom of the press|press]], and [[freedom of religion|religion]]; the people's [[right to keep and bear arms]]; the [[freedom of assembly]]; the [[freedom to petition]]; and the rights to be free of unreasonable [[search and seizure]]; [[cruel and unusual punishment]]; and compelled [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|self-incrimination]]. The Bill of Rights also restricts [[United States Congress|Congress]]' power by prohibiting it from making any law respecting [[state religion|establishment of religion]] and by prohibiting the federal government from depriving any person of life, [[liberty]], or [[property]] without [[due process]] of law. In criminal cases, it requires [[indictment]] by [[grand jury]] for any [[capital punishment|capital]] or "infamous crime," guarantees a speedy public [[trial (law)|trial]] with an impartial and local [[jury trial|jury]], and prohibits [[double jeopardy]]. In addition, the Bill of Rights states that "the enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people,"<ref> See: [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]</ref> and reserves all powers not granted to the Federal government to the [[United States nationality law|citizenry]] or [[U.S. state|States]].

These amendments came into effect on [[December 15]], [[1791]], when ratified by three-fourths of the States.  Most were [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|applied to the states]] by a series of decisions applying the due process clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], which was adopted after the [[American Civil War]].

Initially drafted by [[James Madison]] in 1789, the Bill of Rights was written at a time when ideological conflict between [[Federalism (United States)|Federalists]] and [[anti-Federalism|anti-Federalists]], dating from the [[Philadelphia Convention]] in 1787, threatened the Constitution's ratification. The Bill was influenced by [[George Mason]]'s 1776 [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]], the 1689 [[English Bill of Rights]], works of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] pertaining to [[natural rights]], and earlier [[Kingdom of England|English]] political documents such as the [[Magna Carta]] (1215). The Bill was largely a response to the Constitution's influential opponents, including prominent [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]], who argued that it failed to protect the basic principles of human [[liberty]].

The Bill of Rights plays a central role in [[Law of the United States|American law]] and government, and remains a fundamental symbol of the freedoms and [[Culture of the United States|culture]] of the nation. One of the original fourteen copies of the Bill of Rights is on public display at the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]

The original document proposed by Congress to the states actually contained 12 "Articles" of proposed amendment. However, only the third through twelfth articles, corresponding to what became the First through Tenth Amendments to the Constitution, were ratified by the required number of states by 1791. The first Article, dealing with the [[United States congressional apportionment|number and apportionment]] of members of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], never became part of the Constitution. The second Article, limiting the ability of Congress to increase the salaries of its members, was ratified two centuries later as the [[Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|27th Amendment]]. The term "Bill of Rights" has traditionally meant only the 10 amendments that became part of the Constitution in 1791, and not the first two, which dealt with Congress itself rather than the rights of the people. That traditional usage has continued even since the ratification of the [[Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|27th Amendment]].

==Background==
{{See also|Articles of Confederation|History of the United States Constitution}}
The [[Philadelphia Convention]] set out to correct weaknesses inherent in the [[Articles of Confederation]] that had been apparent even before the [[American Revolutionary War]] had been successfully concluded. The newly constituted Federal government included a strong [[executive branch]], a stronger [[legislative branch]] and an independent [[judiciary]]. 

===Arguments against the Bill of Rights===
:''See also: [[Federalist Papers]].''
[[Image:Alexander Hamilton.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A portrait of Alexander Hamilton by [[John Trumbull]], 1792]]
The idea of adding a bill of rights to the Constitution was originally controversial. [[Alexander Hamilton]], in ''[[The Federalist Papers|Federalist]]'' [[Federalist No. 84|No. 84]], argued against a "Bill of Rights," asserting that ratification of the Constitution did not mean the American people were surrendering their rights, and therefore that protections were unnecessary: "Here, in strictness, the people surrender nothing, and as they retain every thing, they have no need of particular reservations." As critics of the Constitution referred to earlier political documents that had protected specific rights, Hamilton argued that the Constitution was inherently different. Unlike previous political arrangements between sovereigns and subjects, in the United States there would be no agent empowered to abridge the people's rights: <blockquote>"Bills of rights are in their origin, stipulations between kings and their subjects, abridgments of prerogative in favor of privilege, reservations of rights not surrendered to the prince. Such was <!--PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS A QUOTATION OF HAMILTON IN WHICH HE USED THE ALTERNATE SPELLING "MAGNA CHARTA" IT IS NOT A TYPO - PLEASE DO NOT MODIFY IT, THANKS!-->[[Magna Carta|Magna Charta]], obtained by the Barons, sword in hand, from King [[John of England|John]]."<ref> Hamilton, Alexander. ''The Federalist Papers'', #84. {{cite web|title="On opposition to a Bill of Rights."|url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/bill_of_rightss7.html|accessdate=2006-02-28}}</ref> </blockquote>

Finally, Hamilton expressed the fear that protecting specific rights might imply that any unmentioned rights would not be protected:  <blockquote>"I go further, and affirm that bills of rights, in the sense and in the extent in which they are contended for, are not only unnecessary in the proposed constitution, but would even be dangerous. They would contain various exceptions to powers which are not granted; and on this very account, would afford a colorable pretext to claim more than were granted.  For why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do?"'''</blockquote>

Essentially, Hamilton and other Federalists believed in the British system of [[common law]] which did not define or quantify [[natural rights]]. They believed that adding a Bill of Rights to the Constitution would limit their rights to those listed in the Constitution. This is the primary reason the [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]] was included.

===The Anti-Federalists===
[[Image:Patrick henry.JPG|200px|left|thumb|On June 5, 1788, [[Patrick Henry]] spoke before Virginia's ratification convention in opposition to the Constitution: "Is it necessary for your liberty that you should abandon those great rights by the adoption of this system? Is the relinquishment of the trial by jury and the liberty of the press necessary for your liberty? Will the abandonment of your most sacred rights tend to the security of your liberty? Liberty, the greatest of all earthly blessings—give us that precious jewel, and you may take every thing else!"]]
{{main|Anti-Federalism}} ''See also: [[Anti-Federalist Papers]].''

During the debate over the ratification of the Constitution, famous revolutionary figures such as [[Patrick Henry]] came out publicly against the Constitution.<ref> Henry, Patrick.  {{cite web|url=http://www.wfu.edu/~zulick/340/henry.html|title="Against the Federal Constitution."  June 5, 1788.|date=[[2006-03-10]]}}</ref> They argued that the strong national government proposed by the Federalists was a threat to [[individual rights]] and that the [[President of the United States|President]] would become a king, and objected to the federal court system in the proposed Constitution. [[Thomas Jefferson]], ambassador to [[Early Modern France|France]], described his concern over the lack of a Bill of Rights, among other criticisms. In answer to the argument that a list of rights might be interpreted as being exhaustive, Jefferson wrote to Madison, "Half a loaf is better than no bread. If we cannot secure all our rights, let us secure what we can."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/print_documents/v1ch14s49.html|title=Jefferson's letter to Madison, March 15, 1789.|date=[[2006-03-09]]}}</ref>

The best and most influential of the articles and speeches criticizing the Constitution were gathered by historians into a collection known as the ''[[Anti-Federalist papers]]'', in allusion to the ''[[Federalist Papers]]'' which had supported the creation of a stronger federal government. One of these, an essay "On the lack of a Bill of Rights," later called "Antifederalist No. 84," was written under the pseudonym [[Brutus]], probably by [[Robert Yates (politician)|Robert Yates]]. In response to the Federalist view that it was unnecessary to protect the people against powers that the government would not be granted, "Brutus" wrote:  <blockquote>"We find they have, in the [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 9: Limits on Congress|ninth section of the first article]] declared, that the writ of [[habeas corpus]] shall not be suspended, unless in cases of rebellion &mdash; that no [[bill of attainder]], or [[ex post facto]] law, shall be passed &mdash; that no title of [[nobility]] shall be granted by the United States, etc. If every thing which is not given is reserved, what propriety is there in these exceptions? Does this Constitution any where grant the power of suspending the habeas corpus, to make ex post facto laws, pass bills of attainder, or grant titles of nobility? It certainly does not in express terms. The only answer that can be given is, that these are implied in the general powers granted. With equal truth it may be said, that all the powers which the bills of rights guard against the abuse of, are contained or implied in the general ones granted by this Constitution."<ref> {{cite web|title="On the lack of a Bill of Rights," also known as "Anti-Federalist #84"|url=http://www.wepin.com/articles/afp/afp84.html|accessdate=2006-02-28}}  Also see: "The Federalist with Letters of Brutus", edited by Terence Ball, Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought, pgs 447–453.  Excerpt from the writings of "Brutus" probably in the New York Journal, November 1, 1787.</ref></blockquote>   

Yates continued with an implication directed against the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Framers]]:  "Ought not a government, vested with such extensive and indefinite authority, to have been restricted by a declaration of rights? It certainly ought. So clear a point is this, that I cannot help suspecting that persons who attempt to persuade people that such reservations were less necessary under this Constitution than under those of the States, are wilfully endeavoring to deceive, and to lead you into an absolute state of vassalage."<ref>''op.cit''</ref>

===Ratification and the Massachusetts Compromise===
[[Image:Letter from George Washington to Lafayette 28 Apr 1788 photo.png|right|thumb|200px|[[George Washington]]'s 1788 letter to the [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette|Marquis de Lafayette]] observed, "the Convention of Massachusetts adopted the Constitution in toto; but recommended a number of specific alterations and quieting explanations."  Source: [[Library of Congress]]]]
[[Individualism]] was the strongest element of opposition; the necessity, or at least the desirability, of a bill of rights was almost universally felt, and the Anti-Federalists were able to play on these feelings in the ratification convention in [[Massachusetts]]. By this stage, five of the states had ratified the Constitution with relative ease; however, the Massachusetts convention was bitter and contentious:

<blockquote>"In Massachusetts, the Constitution ran into serious, organized opposition. Only after two leading Antifederalists, [[Samuel Adams|Adams]] and [[John Hancock|Hancock]], negotiated a far-reaching compromise did the convention vote for ratification on February 6, 1788 (187–168). Antifederalists had demanded that the Constitution be amended before they would consider it or that amendments be a condition of ratification; Federalists had retorted that it had to be accepted or rejected as it was. Under the Massachusetts compromise, the delegates recommended amendments to be considered by the new Congress, should the Constitution go into effect.  The Massachusetts compromise determined the fate of the Constitution, as it permitted delegates with doubts to vote for it in the hope that it would be amended."<ref>Bernstein, Richard B.  "Ratification of the Constitution."  {{cite web|title=''The Reader's Companion to American History''|url=http://college.hmco.com/history/readerscomp/rcah/html/ah_073800_ratification.htm|accessdate=2006-02-28}}</ref></blockquote>

Four of the next five states to ratify, including [[New Hampshire]], [[Virginia]], and [[New York]], included similar language in their ratification instruments. They all sent recommendations for amendments with their ratification documents to the new Congress. Since many of these recommendations pertained to safeguarding personal rights, this pressured Congress to add a Bill of Rights after Constitutional ratification. Additionally, [[North Carolina]] refused to ratify the Constitution until progress was made on the issue of the Bill of Rights. Thus, while the Anti-Federalists were unsuccessful in their quest to prevent the adoption of the Constitution, their efforts were not totally in vain.

{{Unreferenced|section|date=January 2007}}
[[Image:JamesMadison.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[James Madison]], "Father of the Constitution" and first author of the Bill of Rights]]
After the Constitution was ratified in 1789, the [[1st United States Congress]] met in [[Federal Hall]] in [[New York City]]. Most of the delegates agreed that a "bill of rights" was needed and most of them agreed on the rights they believed should be enumerated.

Madison, at the head of the Virginia delegation of the 1st Congress, had opposed a Bill of Rights but hoped to preempt a second [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|Constitutional Convention]] that might have undone the difficult compromises of 1787: a second convention would open the entire Constitution to reconsideration and could undermine the work he and so many others had done in establishing the structure of the United States Government.

Madison based much of the Bill of Rights on [[George Mason]]'s [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]] (1776), which itself had been written with Madison's input. He carefully considered the state amendment recommendations as well. He looked for recommendations shared by many states to avoid controversy and reduce opposition to the ratification of the future amendments. Additionally, Madison's work on the Bill of Rights reflected centuries of English law and philosophy, further modified by the principles of the [[American Revolution]]. The English legal tradition included such revolutionary documents as the Magna Carta (1215), protecting the rights of noblemen against the [[King of England]], and the [[English Bill of Rights]] (1689), establishing the rights of legislators in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] against the power of the sovereign. Concurrently, English philosopher [[John Locke]] had argued that all men have inalienable [[natural rights]] and that the purpose of government was to protect [[property rights]], ideas that became part of the American view of government. Madison, in the United States Bill of Rights, continued in the radical tradition of the American Revolution by further extending and codifying these rights.

===Antecedents===
{{see also|John Locke}}
[[Image:Madison.notes.06081789.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Madison's "Notes for speech on Constitutional amendments, June 8, 1791, in which he underlined the concept of "[[natural rights]] retained"]]To some degree, the Bill of Rights (and the American Revolution) incorporated the ideas of John Locke, who argued in his 1689 work ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'' that [[civil society]] was created for the protection of property ([[Latin]] ''proprius'', or that which is one's own, meaning "life, liberty, and estate").  Locke also advanced the notion that each individual is free and equal in the [[state of nature]]. Locke expounded on the idea of natural rights that are inherent to all individuals, a concept Madison mentioned in his speech presenting the Bill of Rights to the 1st Congress.

{{see also|Virginia Declaration of Rights}}
The Virginia Declaration of Rights, well-known to Madison, had already been a strong influence on the American Revolution ("all power is vested in, and consequently derived from, the people ...";<ref> [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]], Article 2</ref> also "a majority of the community hath an indubitable, unalienable, and indefeasible right to reform, alter or abolish [the government]"). It had shaped the drafting of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] a decade before the drafting of the Constitution, proclaiming that "all men are by nature equally free and independent, and have certain inherent rights of which ... [they cannot divest;] namely, the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety."<ref> Article 1, later paraphrased in the opening sentences of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]].</ref> On a practical level, its recommendations of a government with a [[separation of powers]] (Articles 5&ndash;6) and "frequent, certain, and regular"<ref> Article 5</ref> [[Elections in the United States|elections]] of executives and legislators were incorporated into the United States Constitution &mdash; but the bulk of this work addresses the rights of the people and restrictions on the powers of government, and is recognizable in the modern Bill of Rights:

The government should not have the power of suspending or executing laws, "without consent of the representatives of the people,".<ref> Article 7</ref> A legal defendant has the right to be "confronted with the accusers and witnesses, to call for evidence in his favor, and to a speedy trial by an impartial jury of his vicinage," and may not be "compelled to give evidence against himself."<ref> Article 8</ref> Individuals should be protected against "[[cruel and unusual punishment]]s",<ref>Article 9</ref> baseless [[search and seizure]],,<ref> Article 10</ref> and be guaranteed a [[jury trial|trial by jury]].<ref>Article 11</ref> The government should not abridge [[freedom of the press]],<ref> Article 12</ref> or [[freedom of religion]] ("all men are equally entitled to the free exercise of religion").<ref>Article 16</ref> The government should be enjoined against maintaining a [[standing army]] rather than a "well regulated [[militia]]."<ref> Article 13</ref>

{{see also|English Bill of Rights}}
The English Bill of Rights (1689), one of the fundamental documents of English law, differed substantially in form and intent from the American Bill of Rights, because it was intended to address the rights of citizens as represented by [[British Parliament|Parliament]] against [[the Crown]]. However, some of its basic tenets are adopted and extended to the general public by the U.S. Bill of Rights, including

*the right of petition
*an independent judiciary (the Sovereign was forbidden to establish his own courts or to act as a judge himself),
*freedom from [[taxation]] by royal (executive) prerogative, without agreement by Parliament (legislators), 
*freedom from a peace-time standing army,
*freedom [for [[Protestantism|Protestant]]s] to bear arms for self-defence,
*freedom to elect members of Parliament without interference from the Sovereign,
*freedom of speech in Parliament,
*freedom from cruel and unusual punishments and excessive [[bail]], and 
*freedom from fines and [[forfeiture]]s without trial.

===Madison's preemptive proposal===
On [[June 8]] [[1789]], Madison submitted his proposal to Congress. In his speech to Congress on that day, Madison said,
:"For while we feel all these inducements to go into a revisal of the constitution, we must feel for the constitution itself, and make that revisal a moderate one. I should be unwilling to see a door opened for a re-consideration of the whole structure of the government, for a re-consideration of the principles and the substance of the powers given; because I doubt, if such a door was opened, if we should be very likely to stop at that point which would be safe to the government itself: But I do wish to see a door opened to consider, so far as to incorporate those provisions for the security of rights, against which I believe no serious objection has been made by any class of our constituents."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jmu.edu/madison/center/main_pages/madison_archives/constit_confed/rights/jmproposal/jmspeech.htm|title=Text of Madison's speech, at the James Madison Center|accessdate=2006-02-28}}</ref>

Prior to listing his proposals for a number of constitutional amendments, Madison acknowledged a major reason for some of the discontent with the Constitution as written: 
:"I believe that the great mass of the people who opposed [the Constitution], disliked it because it did not contain effectual provision against encroachments on particular rights, and those safeguards which they have been long accustomed to have interposed between them and the magistrate who exercised the sovereign power: nor ought we to consider them safe, while a great number of our fellow citizens think these securities necessary."<ref>''op.cit''</ref>

==Ratification process==
On [[November 20]] [[1789]], [[New Jersey]] became the first state to ratify these amendments. On [[December 15]] [[1791]], 10 of these proposals became the First through Tenth Amendments &mdash; and United States law &mdash; when they were ratified by the Virginia legislature.

Articles III to XII were ratified by 11/14 states (> 75%). [[Congressional Apportionment Amendment|Article I]], rejected by [[Delaware]], was ratified only by 10/14 States (< 75%), and despite later ratification by [[Kentucky]] (11/15 states < 75%), the article has never since received the approval of enough states for it to become part of the Constitution. Article II was ratified by 6/14, later 7/15 states, but did not receive the 3/4 majority of States needed for ratification until 1992 when it became the 27th Amendment.

===Ratification dates===
*[[New Jersey]], [[November 20]] [[1789]]; rejected article II
*[[Maryland]], [[December 19]] [[1789]]; approved all
*[[North Carolina]], [[December 22]] [[1789]]; approved all
*[[South Carolina]], [[January 19]] [[1790]]; approved all 
*[[New Hampshire]], [[January 25]] [[1790]]; rejected article II
*[[Delaware]], [[January 28]] [[1790]]; rejected article I
*[[New York]], [[February 27]] [[1790]]; rejected article II
*[[Pennsylvania]], [[March 10]] [[1790]]; rejected article II
*[[Rhode Island]], [[June 7]] [[1790]]; rejected article II
*[[Vermont]], [[November 3]] [[1791]]; approved all
*[[Virginia]], [[December 15]] [[1791]]; approved all

===Later consideration===
Lawmakers in Kentucky, which became the [[List of U.S. states by date of statehood|15th state to join the Union]] in [[June]] [[1792]], ratified the entire set of 12 proposals during that [[commonwealth (United States)|commonwealth]]'s initial month of statehood, perhaps unaware &mdash; given the nature of long-distance communications in the 1700s &mdash; that Virginia's approval six months earlier had already made 10 of the package of 12 part of the Constitution.

Although ratification made the Bill of Rights effective in 1791, three of the original 13 states &mdash; [[Connecticut]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[Massachusetts]] &mdash; did not "ratify" the first 10 amendments until 1939, when they were urged to do so in a celebration of the 150th anniversary of their passage by Congress.<ref>{{cite web|title=Order and Dates of Ratification of the Bill of Rights.|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendments.html|date-2006-02-28}}</ref>

==Incorporation extends to States==
{{main|Incorporation (Bill of Rights) }}
Originally, the Bill of Rights applied only to the federal government and not to the several state governments. Parts of the amendments initially proposed by Madison that would have limited state governments ("No state shall violate the equal rights of conscience, or the freedom of the press, or the trial by jury in criminal cases.") were not approved by Congress, and therefore the Bill of Rights did not appear to apply to the powers of state governments.<ref> Bent, Devin. {{cite web|title="James Madison proposes Bill of Rights."|url=http://www.jmu.edu/madison/center/main_pages/madison_archives/constit_confed/rights/jmproposal/jmproposal.htm|accessdate=2006-02-28}}</ref>

Thus, states had established [[state religion|state churches]] up until the 1820s, and [[Southern United States|Southern states]], beginning in the 1830s, could ban [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] literature. In the 1833 case ''[[Barron v. Baltimore]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] specifically ruled that the Bill of Rights provided "security against the apprehended encroachments of the general government&mdash;not against those of local governments." However, in the 1925 judgment on ''[[Gitlow v. New York]]'', the Supreme Court ruled that the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], which had been adopted in 1868, made certain applications of the Bill of Rights applicable to the states. The Supreme Court then cited the ''Gitlow'' case as precedent for a series of decisions that made most, but not all, of the provisions of the Bill of Rights applicable to the states under the doctrine of ''selective incorporation''.

==Display and honoring of the Bill of Rights==
In 1941, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] declared December 15 to be "Bill of Rights Day", commemorating the 150th anniversary of the ratification of the Bill of Rights.

The Bill of Rights is on display at the [[National Archives and Records Administration]],<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/trt013.html|title=American Treasures of the Library of Congress|date=[[2006-03-13]]}}</ref> in the "Rotunda for the Charters of Freedom."

The Rotunda itself was constructed in the 1950s and dedicated in 1952 by President [[Harry S Truman]], who said, "Only as these documents are reflected in the thoughts and acts of Americans, can they remain symbols of power that can move the world. That power is our faith in human liberty. . ."<ref> {{cite web|title="Truman's Remarks in the Rotunda, December 1952"|date=[[2006-03-14]]|url=http://www.archives.gov/national-archives-experience/visit/truman_transcript.html}}
</ref>

After 50 years, signs of deterioration in the casing were noted, while the documents themselves appeared to be well-preserved:  "But if the ink of 1787 was holding its own, the encasements of 1951 were not...minute crystals and microdroplets of liquid were found on surfaces of the two glass sheets over each document...The CMS scans confirmed evidence of progressive glass deterioration, which was a major impetus in deciding to re-encase the Charters of Freedom."<ref> Mary Lynn Ritzenthaler and Catherine Nicholson, {{cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov/national-archives-experience/charters/charters_preservation_01.html|
title="A New Era Begins for the Charters of Freedom."|date=[[2006-03-14]]}} ''Prologue'', Fall 2003.</ref>

Accordingly, the casing was updated and the Rotunda rededicated on [[September 17]], [[2003]]. In his dedicatory remarks, 216 years after the close of the Constitutional Convention, President [[George W. Bush]] stated, "The true [American] revolution was not to defy one earthly power, but to declare principles that stand above every earthly power—the equality of each person before God, and the responsibility of government to secure the rights of all."<ref> {{cite web|title="Remarks by President George W. Bush at the Rededication of the National Archives."|url=http://www.archives.gov/national-archives-experience/news/visit_reopening_remarks_bush.html|date=[[2006-03-14]]}}</ref>

In 1991, the Bill of Rights toured the country in honor of its bicentennial, visiting the capitals of all 50 states.
