'''American Eagle Outfitters''' is an [[:Category:Clothing companies of the United States|American clothing and accessories]] retailer based in the [[South Side (Pittsburgh)|South Side]] neighborhood of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. It was founded in 1977 by Mark and Jerry Silverman as a subsidiary of [[Retail Ventures]] Incorporated, a company which also owned and operated [[Silverman's Menswear.]]  The Silvermans sold their ownership interests in [[1991]].  At one time, it sold brands such as [[OshKosh B'Gosh|OshKosh]] in the early [[1980s]], similar to [[Gap (clothing)|Gap]] selling [[Levi Strauss & Co.|Levi's]].

==Other brands==
In addition to its namesake brand, American Eagle, the company has developed and announced plans for several new brand and concept initiatives poised to drive new growth as the American Eagle brand nears saturation in current markets. One already launched, being Aerie. 

The company's second stand-alone lifestyle concept, [[Martin + Osa]], launched in the fall of [[2006]], targets men and women 25 to 40 years of age. 

In the year [[2001]], the company acquired a [[Canada]]-based retail concept called [[Bluenotes]], which has approximately 100 stores averaging 3,300 square feet. The concept targeted a slightly younger demographic, ages 12-22, and was positioned as a denim-driven urban/suburban lifestyle brand. Due largely to poor performance, the Bluenotes business was sold to YM Inc. in [[2004]].

===aerie===
[[Image:AeriebyAmericanEagle.jpg|right|thumb|100px|aerie logo]]
The line '''aerie''' was announced in [[February 2006]] as an intimate apparel sub-brand offering bras, panties, and dorm wear targeting American Eagle's core 15- to 25-year-old demographic segment.

===77 kids===
American Eagle released plans in January [[2008]], to launch "'''77 kids'''," a line of clothing aimed at children aged two to 10 years. Shopping at its website will begin as early as August 2008 with physical stores planned to open in the United States in early 2009.

==AE All-Access Pass==
In [[September 2005]], American Eagle Outfitters announced the All-Access Pass customer rewards program. Customers in-store through a simple sign-up process are given a physical "All-Access Pass", which is about the size of a credit card. If you register online for the AE All-Access Pass, you will be prompted to print off a temporary pass, while the actual card will be mailed to you in 2-3 weeks. Customers receiving the pass are also given two cards for their key rings and multiple stickers for MP3 players as well as cell phones. Customers earn points when they present the card to the cashier at the store or enter the card number while checking out at AE.com. Each type of product earns a different amount of points – for example, jeans are worth 20 points. If you collect 50 points, you'll receive a 10% off coupon, 100 points earns you a 20% off coupon, and so on and so forth. Customers can earn coupons up to 40% off and are given 15% off up to seven days before and up to seven days after anyone in their household's birthday. The rewards are mailed out 4 times a year: once in January, April, July and October.

==Competition==
American Eagle Outfitters is often compared to the clothing companies [[Aeropostale]], [[Abercrombie & Fitch]] and [[Hollister Co.|Hollister]], due to their similar styles, marketing techniques, and targeted consumer demographic, as well as the department store private label brands [[Arizona Jean Company]] ([[JC Penney]]) and American Rag ([[Macy's]]). American Eagle Outfitters brands much of their clothing with an embroidered landing [[eagle]], similar to [[Abercrombie & Fitch|Abercrombie and Fitch's]] standing [[moose]], [[Hollister Co.]]'s [[seagull]], and [[Aéropostale (clothing)|Aeropostale]]'s butterfly for females and bulldog for males. Additionally, American Eagle emphasize their date of establishment, [[1977]], in their marketing and design, branding the majority of their products with the date.

==Criticism==
In [[2007]], textile and apparel workers union [[UNITE HERE]] launched the "American Vulture" back-to-school boycott of American Eagle <ref>http://www.americanvulture.org</ref> in protest of alleged workers' rights violations at the company's Canadian distribution contractor [[National Logistics Services]] (NLS). On the 2007 second quarter conference call<ref>http://seekingalpha.com/article/45199-american-eagle-outfitters-f2q07-qtr-end-8-4-07-earnings-call-transcript</ref>, CEO James O'Donnell clarified the American Eagle's relationship with NLS and its effect on business. He explained, "We owned NLS with the acquisition of Braemar back in [[2000]] and we subsequently sold off NLS in 2006, and we are currently a customer of NLS... We have really no involvement at all with Unite Here and NLS. Our only involvement with NLS is basically as a customer and there have been some allegations made I think to some of, to the public about it affecting our business. I can tell you right now it has not affected our business."

==Company growth==
AE(American Eagle) expanded internationally by entering into [[Canada]] after acquiring some [[Dylex]] divisions in [[2000]] (Thrifty's, Braemar & National Logistics).

In [[January 2007]], the company announced that it will accelerate the expansion of aerie by American Eagle with the opening of at least 15 stand-alone locations in 2007. Launched in September, the new intimates sub-brand, featuring a full line of Panties, langere bras and thongs and dorm-wear, is designed to be sweetly-sexy. The brand has been met with strong customer acceptance. The company's expansion plans are based on the positive results of three aerie stand-alone test stores. If new stores continue to perform as well as the test stores, aerie could be a 350+ store chain by [[2012]]. In the fourth quarter, American Eagle opened eight new AE stores and remodeled 20 locations.

In [[2006]], 42 new AE stores opened and 65 remodels were completed. Together with five new MARTIN + OSA stores, and three new aerie stand-alone test stores, total gross square footage increased 8% for the year. In 2007, the company plans to open 45 to 50 AE stores, at least 15 aerie stand-alone stores and approximately 12 new MARTIN + OSA stores. Additionally, approximately 45 AE store remodels are planned, which combined with new store openings will generate total [[2007]] square footage growth of approximately 10%.{{Fact|date=March 2007}}
