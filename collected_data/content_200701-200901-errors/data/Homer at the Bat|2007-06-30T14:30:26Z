"'''Homer at the Bat'''" is the seventeenth episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> [[The Simpsons (season 3)|third season]]. The episode involves Homer's boss, [[Mr. Burns]], trying to guarantee victory in a [[softball]] game between the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]] and the Shelbyville Nuclear Power Plant by signing several [[Major League Baseball]] players. Things do not go as planned. The episode's title is a play on the [[Ernest Thayer|Ernest Lawrence Thayer]] poem "[[Casey at the Bat]]".

==Plot==
The Springfield Nuclear Power Plant softball team has gone through their season undefeated, and in the championship game, they will face the Shelbyville Nuclear Power Plant. Homer is the team's leading hitter, thanks to his homemade bat (a takeoff of the plot of the film ''[[The Natural]]'').

Mr. Burns makes a million dollar bet with [[List of one-time characters from The Simpsons#Aristotle Amadopoulos|Aristotle Amadopoulos]], owner of the Shelbyville plant, that his team will win. To secure victory in the game, Mr. Burns wants to hire major league stars, but Smithers tells Mr. Burns that the players he picked are all dead. Thus, Mr. Burns orders Smithers to find some current superstar players and hires several [[Major League Baseball]] players to "work at the plant" and to play on the team, much to the dismay of the plant workers who got the team to the championship game in the first place.

However, the night before the game, all the players except for [[Darryl Strawberry]] have different incidents that prevent them from playing. Mr. Burns is forced to use actual employees, but keeps Homer on the bench because Strawberry plays his position. Homer does get in, though, with the score tied and bases loaded in the 9th inning, when Burns wants a [[Platoon system|right-handed hitter against a left-handed pitcher]]. The very first pitch [[hit by pitch|hits Homer]] [[beanball|in the head]], rendering him unconscious and forcing in the winning run. Homer is then paraded as a hero, still unconscious.

During the credits, [[Terry Cashman]], who wrote the song "[[Talkin' Baseball]]", sings a take on his hit, "Talkin' Softball".

== Baseball players ==

When Burns gets the idea of acquiring ringers, he proposes a team of 19th century and [[dead-ball era]] players that he wants Smithers to sign. Smithers then has to tell Burns that all these players have retired and passed on, and that the right fielder (Jim Creighton) has been dead for 130 years.

*P: [[Mordecai Brown|Mordecai "Three Finger" Brown]]
*C: [[Gabby Street]]
*1B: [[Cap Anson]]
*2B: [[Napoleon Lajoie]]
*SS: [[Honus Wagner]]
*3B: [[Pie Traynor]]
*LF: [[Shoeless Joe Jackson]]
*CF: [[Harry Hooper]]
*RF: [[Jim Creighton]]

It should be noted that although most of these players were contemporaries, Traynor (the youngest member of the team) was born more than half a century later than Creighton. In fact, seven of the players (Anson being the exception) weren't even born yet when Creighton died. Anson, too, is a lot older than the rest of the team. He was 44 years old and close to retirement by the time Lajoie and Wagner made their Major League debuts, and had retired before any of the other players reached the Majors. Furthermore, Traynor is significantly younger than the rest of the team, and when he made his Major League debut in 1920, only Hooper was still active.  It should be noted that Shoeless Joe Jackson was embroiled in the [[Black Sox Scandal]] at the time and would soon be banned from the majors for his part in throwing the [[1919 World Series]].

Mr. Burns sends Smithers to [[scout (sport)|scout]] players from Major League Baseball, recruiting the following players. However, eight of the nine players were not able to play in the championship game due to unique misfortunes:

The players in this episode were an extremely talented group. They combined for 77 [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All Star]] selections, 34 [[Gold Glove]]s, 7 [[Cy Young Award|Cy Young]]s, and 4 league [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] awards. They also won a combined 12 [[World Series]]. Smith and Boggs are presently the only members of the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] from this group, although several players are not yet eligible for election. As of December [[2006]], Ken Griffey, Jr. and Roger Clemens are the only remaining active players (Mike Scioscia manages the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]], José Canseco plays for the [[Long Beach Armada]] in the [[Independent baseball|Independent]] [[Golden Baseball League]], and Don Mattingly serves as the New York Yankees bench coach). At the time, only Steve Sax and Don Mattingly had played for the [[New York Yankees]]. Four of the other ringers would later play for the Yankees (Boggs, Clemens, Canseco, and Strawberry).

== Production ==
José Canseco was originally slated to wake up in bed with [[Edna Krabappel]] and miss the game, but Canseco's then-wife, Esther Haddad, objected. Because of the change, [[Marcia Wallace]] was listed in the credits, even though Mrs. Krabappel didn't appear at all in the episode.

In the DVD commentary, Al Jean hints that eight of the baseball players were really nice guys, except for one guy whose name rhymes with "Manseco". He later says that Canseco had a hard time saying his lines and was really difficult every time he was told to do a retake. As well, he insisted that his original part be rewritten, so he was written as a hero. 

Several of the players in this episode are purposely given distinctly different personalities than what they are known for. Darryl Strawberry, well known for being self-serving and hard to deal with is depicted as an ass kissing coach's dream. Jose Canseco, known for his self-promotion and grandiosity is shown as a hero who rescues everything a woman owns from a fire.

== Cultural references ==
*The episode makes several allusions to ''[[The Natural]]'', a movie starring [[Robert Redford]] and which is based upon [[Bernard Malamud]]'s book by the same name. Homer's secret weapon, his self-created "Wonderbat", is akin to [[Roy Hobbs]]'s "[[Wonderboy]]". Both bats are eventually destroyed. The scene featuring the explosion of stadium lights as Homer circles the basepaths is taken directly from the film, as is the scene with the team and the [[hypnosis|hypnotist]].
*The end song "Talkin' Softball" was actually re-written from an older song "Talkin' Baseball" by [[Terry Cashman]], singer/writer of the song. Cashman has rewritten his lyrics several times for particular teams.
* The scenes of the Power Plant team traveling from city to city by train, overlaid with the pennant of the city their going to, is a reference to the 1942 film ''[[The Pride of the Yankees]]''.
* This episode marks the second time in the series that someone mentions the phrase "It's like there's a party in my mouth and everyone's invited!" Ken Griffey Jr. says it after trying Mr. Burns's nerve tonic. The first being [[Moe Szyslak|Moe]]'s exclamation upon sampling the episode's titular beverage in the season 3 episode "[[Flaming Moe's]]". This line was parodied in "[[Parasites Lost]]", a season 3 episode of ''[[Futurama]]'', another cartoon created by [[Matt Groening]], when [[Philip J. Fry|Fry]] eats a very expired egg salad sandwich and exclaims "It's like there's a party in my mouth and everyone's throwing up!" Griffey had trouble performing the line, a number of outtakes of which are presented as a hidden feature on the [[The Simpsons DVDs#The Complete Third Season|Season 3 DVD set]].
