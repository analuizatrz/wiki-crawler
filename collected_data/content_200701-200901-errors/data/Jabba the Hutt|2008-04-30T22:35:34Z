<!--Chronologically, Jabba appears in Episode I first; historically, he was only in Episode VI until the re-release of IV and release of I.-->
'''Jabba the Hutt''' is a [[fictional character]] in [[George Lucas]]' [[science fiction]] saga ''[[Star Wars]]''. He first appeared on film in ''[[Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983) as an [[obese]], [[slug]]-like [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]]. Jabba was originally portrayed by an immense [[latex]] puppet, but in other films he is a [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated image]] (CGI). Besides the films, Jabba the Hutt is featured in ''Star Wars'' [[Star Wars Expanded Universe|literature]] and is sometimes referenced by his full name, '''Jabba Desilijic Tiure'''.<ref name="Sansweet">"Jabba Desilijic Tiure (Jabba the Hutt)", in Sansweet, ''Star Wars Encyclopedia'', pp. 146–147.</ref> 

The character's role in ''Star Wars'' is primarily [[antagonist]]ic. He is a 600-year-old [[Hutts|Hutt]] crime lord and gangster who employs a retinue of criminals, [[bounty hunter]]s, [[smuggling|smugglers]], [[assassin]]s, and bodyguards to operate his criminal empire. Jabba the Hutt's [[Jabba's Palace|palace]] on the desert planet [[Tatooine]] is a former monastery for a group of mystics known as the [[List of Star Wars races (A-E)#B'omarr monks|B'omarr monks]]. There he keeps a host of entertainers, [[slave]]s, [[droids]], and alien creatures at his disposal. Jabba has a grim sense of humor, a bellicose laugh, an insatiable appetite, and an affinity for [[gambling]], slave girls, and [[torture]].<ref name="Sansweet">Sansweet, ''Star Wars Encyclopedia'', pp. 146–147.</ref>

The character was incorporated into the ''Star Wars'' merchandising campaign that corresponded with the theatrical release of ''Return of the Jedi''. Jabba the Hutt's image has since played an influential role in [[popular culture]], particularly in the [[United States]]. His name is used as a [[satire|satirical]] literary device and a political caricature to underscore negative qualities such as [[morbid obesity]] and [[corruption]].<ref name="FatWars">For example, see "Fat Wars: The Obesity Empire Strikes Back" at [http://www.consumerfreedom.com/news_detail.cfm/headline/2812 Center for Consumer Freedom].</ref><ref name="Kuiper">Koenraad Kuiper, "Star Wars: An Imperial Myth," ''Journal of Popular Culture'' 21.4 (Spring 1988): p. 78.</ref>

Although a relatively minor character in ''Star Wars'' fiction, Jabba the Hutt has appeared in four of the six ''Star Wars'' films. The character has a recurring role in Expanded Universe literature and is the [[protagonist]] of the comic book anthology ''Jabba the Hutt: The Art of the Deal'' (1998), a collection of comics published between 1995 and 1996.

<!-- ATTENTION! PLEASE READ BEFORE EDITING! Please help keep this section brief. Every detail about the plot of Star Wars or Jabba the Hutt's life does not need to appear here. -->

Jabba the Hutt is mentioned in ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]'' (1977) and ''[[Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980), but his first appearance on film came in 1983 with the third installment of the [[original trilogy|original ''Star Wars'' trilogy]], ''Return of the Jedi''. Directed by [[Richard Marquand]] and written by [[Lawrence Kasdan]] and George Lucas, the first act of ''Return of the Jedi'' features the attempts of [[Princess Leia Organa]] ([[Carrie Fisher]]), the [[Wookiee]] [[Chewbacca]] ([[Peter Mayhew]]), and [[Jedi|Jedi knight]] [[Luke Skywalker]] ([[Mark Hamill]]) to rescue their friend, [[Han Solo]] ([[Harrison Ford]]), who had been imprisoned in [[carbonite]] in the events of the previous film, ''The Empire Strikes Back''.<ref name="SWVI">''Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi'', dir. Richard Marquand (DVD, 20th Century Fox, 2005), disc 1.</ref> 

The captured Han is delivered to Jabba by the bounty hunter [[Boba Fett]] ([[Jeremy Bulloch]]) and placed on display in the crime lord's throne room. Friends of Han, namely, [[Lando Calrissian]] ([[Billy Dee Williams]]), droids [[C-3PO]] ([[Anthony Daniels]]) and [[R2-D2]] ([[Kenny Baker]]), Leia, and Chewbacca infiltrate Jabba's palace as part of a plot to save Han. Shortly after Leia herself is captured and enslaved by the Hutt, Luke arrives to "bargain for Solo's life". Luke, however, is dropped into the pit of the monstrous [[rancor]], just below Jabba's throne room. After Luke slays the beast, Jabba condemns Luke, Han, and Chewbacca to a slow death in the belly of the [[Sarlacc]], a large alien creature in Tatooine's [[Tatooine#Dune Sea|Dune Sea]]. The execution turns into a skirmish at the [[Great Pit of Carkoon]] where Luke escapes execution with the help of R2-D2 and defeats Jabba's guards. During the subsequent confusion, Leia strangles the Hutt to death with her slave chains. Luke, Leia, C-3PO, and R2-D2 escape just before Jabba's sail barge explodes, killing all inside.<ref name="SWVI"/>

The second film appearance of Jabba the Hutt is in the [[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope#Special Editions|Special Edition]] of ''A New Hope'' which was released in 1997 to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the original ''Star Wars''. Han Solo has a confrontation in a [[Mos Eisley]] [[Mos Eisley Cantina|cantina]] with an alien bounty hunter named [[Minor bounty hunters in Star Wars#Greedo|Greedo]] (Paul Blake and Maria De Aragon) that ends with Greedo's death. According to Greedo, Jabba "has no use for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an [[Interdictor Cruiser (Imperial)|Imperial cruiser]]." Jabba had hired Han to smuggle the illicit drug [[spice (Star Wars)|spice]] from the planet [[List of Star Wars planets (K-L)#Kessel|Kessel]]. Han, however, was forced to dump his cargo when an [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Imperial]] search team boarded the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', Han's ship. Greedo tells Han, "Jabba's put a [[Bounty (reward)|price]] on your head so large, every bounty hunter in [[Star Wars Galaxy|the galaxy]] will be looking for you." In a scene that had been cut from the 1977 original, Jabba and an entourage of bounty hunters are seen in a hangar bay outside the ''Millennium Falcon'', trying to find the smuggler. Jabba confirms Greedo's last words and demands that Han pay the value of the shipment. Han promises to compensate Jabba as soon as he receives payment for delivering "goods"—[[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] ([[Alec Guinness]]), Luke Skywalker, R2-D2, and C-3PO—to the planet [[Alderaan]]. Jabba warns Han that if he is not paid back soon, he will post a bounty "so big, you won't be able to go near a civilized system." Due to circumstances beyond Han's control, however, he never completes his deal with the Hutt.<ref>''Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope'', Special Edition, dir. George Lucas (DVD, 20th Century Fox, 2005), disc 1.</ref>

Jabba the Hutt's final film appearance is in the 1999 [[prequel]], ''[[Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace]]''. The character's scene is [[Cameo appearance|minor]] and has little to do with the plot of the film. During the [[Boonta Eve Classic]] [[podrace]] at [[List of Star Wars cities#Mos Espa|Mos Espa]] on Tatooine, in which nine-year-old [[Anakin Skywalker]] ([[Jake Lloyd]]) wins his freedom by outracing his competitors, Jabba the Hutt is featured in his grandstand accompanied by [[List of minor residents of Tatooine#Gardulla the Hutt|Gardulla the Hutt]] (a Hutt female) and his [[Twi'lek]] [[Majordomo (domestic staff)|majordomo]] [[Bib Fortuna]] ([[Matthew Wood]]). Although he is the host of the race, Jabba is totally uninterested and even dozes off, missing the race's conclusion.<ref>"Mos Espa Grand Arena" at the [http://www.starwars.com/databank/location/mosespagrandarena/index.html Star Wars Databank].</ref><ref>''Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace'', dir.

The first appearances of Jabba the Hutt in ''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe literature was in [[Marvel Comics]]'s [[Star Wars canon|non-canonical]] adaptations of ''A New Hope''. ''Six Against the Galaxy'' (1977) by [[Roy Thomas]] and ''What Ever Happened to Jabba the Hut?'' (1979) and ''In Mortal Combat'' (1980), both by [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]], depict Jabba the Hutt (originally spelled ''Hut'') as a tall humanoid with a [[walrus]]-like face, a [[Chonmage|topknot]], and a bright uniform.

Later Expanded Universe novels and comics adopt the character's image as seen in the film. They also elaborate on his background prior to the events of the ''Star Wars'' films. For example, ''[[Zorba the Hutt's Revenge]]'' (1992), a [[Young adult literature|young adult novel]] by [[Paul Davids|Paul and Hollace Davids]], reveals that Jabba's father is a powerful crime lord called [[List of minor Star Wars villains#Zorba the Hutt|Zorba the Hutt]] and that Jabba was born 596 years before the events of ''A New Hope'', making him around 600 years old at the time of his death in ''Return of the Jedi''.<ref>Paul Davids and Hollace Davids, ''Zorba the Hutt's Revenge'' (New York: Bantam Spectra, 1992), ISBN 0-553-15889-9.</ref> [[Ann C.

''[[Tales from Jabba's Palace]]'' (1996), a collection of short stories edited by [[science fiction]] author [[Kevin J. Anderson]], pieces together the lives of Jabba the Hutt's various minions in his palace and their relationship to him during the last days of his life. The stories reveal that few of the Hutt's servants are loyal to him and most are in fact plotting to have him [[assassination|assassinated]]. When Jabba the Hutt is killed in ''Return of the Jedi'', his surviving former courtiers join forces with his rivals on Tatooine and his family on the Hutt homeworld [[List of Star Wars planets (M-N)#Nal Hutta|Nal Hutta]] make claims to his palace, fortune, and criminal empire.<ref>Kevin J.

[[Image:Jabbandhaninmoseisley.jpg|right|250px|thumb|In this scene from ''A New Hope'', [[Han Solo]] [[sarcasm|sarcastically]] tells Jabba the Hutt, "You're a wonderful human being."]]
Jabba the Hutt's physical appearance is as grotesque as his character and reinforces his personality as a criminal deviant. As Han Solo puts it in ''Return of the Jedi'', Jabba is a "slimy piece of worm-ridden filth." Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] describes him as "a cross between a toad and the [[Cheshire Cat]]",<ref>Roger Ebert, review of ''Return of the Jedi'', Chicago ''Sun-Times'', [[25 May]] [[1983]], at [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19830525/REVIEWS/305250301/1023 RogerEbert.com]; last accessed [[July 3]], [[2006]].</ref> and [[Astrophysics|astrophysicist]] and science fiction writer [[Jeanne Cavelos]] gives Jabba the "award for most disgusting alien."<ref>Jeanne Cavelos, "Just Because It Goes 'Ho Ho Ho' Doesn't Mean It's Santa", ''The Science of Star Wars: An Astrophysicist's Independent Examination of Space Travel, Aliens, Planets, and Robots as Portrayed in the ''Star Wars'' Films and Books'' (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1999), p. 57, ISBN 0-312-20958-4.</ref> Science fiction authors [[Tom Veitch|Tom and Martha Veitch]] write that Jabba's body is a "miasmic mass" of flesh that shakes as he laughs. He emits an unmistakable smell: "The Hutt's lardaceous body seemed to periodically release a greasy discharge, sending fresh waves of rotten stench" into the air. His swollen tongue drips with saliva as he feeds on creatures that resemble frogs and maggots.<ref>Tom Veitch and Martha Veitch, "A Hunter's Fate: Greedo's Tale", in Kevin J. Anderson, ed., ''Tales from the Mos Eisley Cantina'' (paperback; New York: Bantam Spectra, 1995), pp. 49–53, ISBN 0-553-56468-4.</ref> Jabba's appetite is insatiable and he is not discriminatory about his diet. For example, his [[jester]], the Kowakian monkey-lizard [[List of minor residents of Tatooine#Crumb, Salacious B.|Salacious B. Crumb]], must make the Hutt crime lord laugh once a day, every day, or Jabba will eat him.<ref>Ryder Windham, ''This Crumb for Hire'', in ''A Decade of Dark Horse'' #2 (Dark Horse Comics, 1996).</ref><ref>Esther M. Friesner, "That's Entertainment: The Tale of Salacious Crumb", in Anderson, ed., ''Tales from Jabba's Palace'', pp. 60–79.</ref>

Jabba the Hutt does show rare moments of [[Altruism|charity]], however. For instance, in one Expanded Universe story, he prevents a Chevin named [[List of minor residents of Tatooine#Ephant Mon|Ephant Mon]] from freezing to death on an ice planet by covering him with his bloated layers of fat; the two are eventually rescued, and Ephant Mon becomes totally loyal to the crime lord, making him the only resident of Jabba's palace that the crime lord trusts.<ref>Ephant Mon, Expanded Universe [http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/ephantmon/?id=eu Star Wars Databank]; last accessed [[July 3]], [[2006]].</ref>

== Concept and creation ==
Jabba the Hutt's appearance underwent several changes between different versions of the films. The shift in the concept of Jabba the Hutt from a furry creature to a slug and from a puppet to [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] represent two of the more glaring changes to the character in the concept and creation process.

=== ''Episode IV: A New Hope'' ===
The original script to ''A New Hope'' describes Jabba as a "fat, slug-like creature with eyes on extended feelers and a huge ugly mouth",<ref name="DatabankBTS"/> but Lucas stated in an interview that the initial character he had in mind was much furrier and resembled a Wookiee. When filming the scene between Han Solo and Jabba in 1976, Lucas employed [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] actor [[Declan Mulholland]] to play the stand-in and read Jabba the Hutt's lines wearing a shaggy brown suit. Lucas planned to replace Mulholland in post-production with a [[stop motion|stop-motion]] creature. The scene was meant to connect ''A New Hope'' to ''Return of the Jedi'' and explain why Han Solo was imprisoned at the end of ''The Empire Strikes Back''.<ref>George Lucas interview, ''Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope'', Special Edition (VHS, 20th Century Fox, 1997).</ref> Nevertheless, Lucas decided to leave the scene out of the final film on account of budget and time constraints and because he felt that it did not enhance the film's plot.<ref>George Lucas commentary, ''Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope'', Special Edition, dir. George Lucas, (DVD, 20th Century Fox, 2004).</ref> The scene remained in the novelisation, comic book and radio adaptations of the film. 

[[Image:FordandMulholland.jpg|left|thumb|[[Harrison Ford]] (left) and [[Declan Mulholland]], Jabba the Hutt's stand-in, in an uncompleted scene from ''A New Hope'' in 1976.]]
Lucas revisited the scene in the 1997 Special Edition release of ''A New Hope'', restoring the sequence and replacing Mulholland with a CGI version of Jabba the Hutt and the English dialogue with [[Huttese language|Huttese]], a [[fictional language]] created by sound designer [[Ben Burtt]]. Joseph Letteri, the visual effects supervisor for the Special Edition, explained that the ultimate goal of the revised scene was to make it look as if Jabba the Hutt was actually on the set talking to and acting with Harrison Ford and that the crew had merely photographed it. Letteri stated that the new scene consisted of five shots that took over a year to complete.<ref>Joseph Letteri interview, ''Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope'', Special Edition (VHS, 20th Century Fox, 1997).</ref><ref>"''A New Hope'': Special Edition — What has changed?: Jabba the Hutt", [[15 January]] [[1997]], at [http://www.starwars.com/episode-iv/bts/article/f19970115/indexp2.html StarWars.com]; last accessed [[July 3]], [[2006]].</ref> The scene was polished further for the 2004 release on [[DVD]], improving Jabba's appearance with advancements in CGI techniques, although neither release looks exactly like the original Jabba the Hutt puppet.<ref>"Star Wars: The Changes — Part One" at [http://www.dvdactive.com/editorial/articles/star-wars-the-changes-part-one.html DVDActic.com]; last accessed [[July 3]], [[2006]].</ref> 

At one point of the original scene Ford walks behind Mulholland. This became a problem when adding the CGI Jabba, since he had a tail that happened to be in the way. Eventually this problem was solved by having Han stepping on Jabba's tail, causing the Hutt to react with a yelp of pain.

Lucas confesses that some people were upset about the CGI Jabba's appearance, most complaining that the character (and others like it) "looked fake". Lucas dismisses this, stating that whether a character is portrayed as a puppet or as CGI, it will always be "fake" since the character is not real. He says he sees no difference between a puppet made of latex and one generated by a computer.<ref name="Lucascommentary">George Lucas commentary, ''Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi'', Special Edition, dir. Richard Marquand (DVD, 20th Century Fox, 2004).</ref> The CGI character performed actions that the puppet could not, such as walking. Jabba's film appearance in ''The Phantom Menace'' was as a CGI based on the character from ''A New Hope''.

=== ''Episode VI: Return of the Jedi'' ===
[[Image:Jabbaconceptart.jpg|right|thumb|Concept artwork of Jabba the Hutt for ''Return of the Jedi'' designed by [[Industrial Light and Magic]].]]
Lucas based the CGI on the character as he originally appeared in ''Return of the Jedi''. In this film, Jabba the Hutt is an immense, sedentary, slug-like creature designed by Lucas' [[Industrial Light and Magic]] Creature Shop. Design consultant [[Ralph McQuarrie]] claimed, "In my sketches Jabba was huge, agile, sort of an apelike figure. But then the design went into another direction, and Jabba became more like a worm kind of creature."<ref>Ralph McQuarrie, quoted in Laurent Bouzereau, ''Star Wars: The Annotated Screenplays'' (New York: Del Rey, 1997), p. 239, ISBN 0-345-40981-7.</ref> According to the 1985 documentary ''From Star Wars to Jedi'', Lucas rejected initial designs of the character. One made Jabba appear too human — almost like a [[Fu Manchu]] character — while a second made him look too snail-like. Lucas finally settled on a design that was a hybrid of the two.<ref name="StarWarstoJedi">''From Star Wars to Jedi: The Making of a Saga'', narrated by Mark Hamill (1985; VHS, CBS Fox Video, 1992).</ref> ''Return of the Jedi'' costume designer Nilo Rodis-Jamero commented, <blockquote>My vision of Jabba was literally [[Orson Welles]] when he was older. I saw him as a very refined man. Most of the villains we like are very smart people. But [[Phil Tippett]] kept imagining him as some kind of slug, almost like in ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice in Wonderland]]''. At one time he sculpted a creature that looked like a slug that's smoking. I kept thinking I must be really off, but eventually that's where it led up to."<ref>Nilo Rodis-Jamero, quoted in Bouzereau, ''Annotated Screenplays'', p. 239.</ref></blockquote>

Designed by visual effects artist Phil Tippett,<ref>Biography of Phil Tippett at [http://www.starwars.com/bio//philtippett.html StarWars.com]; last accessed [[July 3]], [[2006]].</ref> Jabba the Hutt was inspired by the anatomy of several animal species. His body structure and reproductive processes were based on [[annelid worm]]s, hairless animals that have no [[skeleton]] and are [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]]. Jabba's head was modeled after that of a snake, complete with bulbous, slit-pupilled eyes and a mouth that opens wide enough to swallow large prey. His skin was given moist, [[amphibian]] qualities. Jabba's design would come to represent almost all members of the Hutt species in subsequent ''Star Wars'' fiction.<ref name="HuttSansweet"/>

In ''Return of the Jedi'', Jabba is portrayed by a one-ton puppet that took three months and half a million dollars to construct. While filming the movie, the puppet had its own makeup artist. The puppet required three puppeteers to operate, making it one of the largest ever used in a motion picture.<ref name="StarWarstoJedi"/> [[Stuart Freeborn]] designed the puppet, while John Coppinger sculpted its latex, clay, and foam pieces. Puppeteers included David Alan Barclay, Toby Philpott, and [[Mike Edmonds]], who were members of [[Jim Henson]]'s [[Muppet]] group. Barclay operated the right arm and mouth and read the character's English dialogue, while Philpott controlled the left arm, head, and tongue. Edmonds, the shortest of the three men (he also played the [[Ewok]] [[List of minor Star Wars characters#Logray|Logray]] in later scenes) was responsible for the movement of Jabba's tail. The eyes and facial expressions were operated by [[radio control]].<ref name="StarWarstoJedi"/><ref name="Lucascommentary"/><ref name="DatabankBTS"/>

[[Image:In jabba.jpg|left|thumb|Design of the Jabba the Hutt puppet for ''Return of the Jedi''.]]
Lucas voiced displeasure in the puppet's appearance and immobility, complaining that the puppet had to be moved around the set to film different scenes. In the [[DVD]] commentary to the Special Edition of ''Return of the Jedi'', Lucas notes that if the technology had been available in 1983, Jabba the Hutt would have been a CGI character similar to the one that appears in the Special Edition scene of ''A New Hope''.<ref name="Lucascommentary"/>

Jabba the Hutt only speaks Huttese on film, but his lines are [[subtitle]]d in [[English (language)|English]]. His voice and Huttese-language dialogue were performed by [[voice actor]] [[Larry Ward (voice actor)|Larry Ward]], whose work is listed in the end credits.<ref name="StarWarstoJedi"/><ref>Larry Ward at the [http://imdb.com/name/nm1843827/ Internet Movie Database]; last accessed [[July 3]], [[2006]].</ref> A heavy, booming quality was given to Ward's voice by [[Pitch (music)|pitch]]ing it an [[octave]] lower than normal and processing it through a [[Subharmonic|sub-harmonic]] generator.<ref>Tomlinson Holman, ''Sound for Film and Television'' (Burlington, Mass.: Focal Press, 2002), p. 11, ISBN 0-240-80453-8.</ref> A [[soundtrack]] was recorded to accompany the movement of the puppet's limbs and mouth. The sound effects were created by a hand running through a bowl of [[casserole|cheese casserole]] and a muddy towel scraping along the inside of a garbage can.<ref>Ben Burtt commentary, ''Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi'', Special Edition, dir. Richard Marquand (DVD, 20th Century Fox, 2004).</ref>

Jabba the Hutt's musical theme throughout the film, composed by [[John Williams]], is played on a [[tuba]]. One reviewer of ''Return of the Jedi'''s soundtrack comments, "Among the new thematic ideas [of the score is] Jabba the Hutt's cute tuba piece (playing along the [[Political correctness|politically incorrect]] lines of tubas representing fatness) ...."<ref>Review of ''Return of the Jedi'' soundtrack by [http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/jedi.html Filmtracks.com]; last accessed [[July 3]], [[2006]].</ref>  The theme is very similar to one Williams wrote for a heavyset character in ''[[Fitzwilly]]'' (1967), though the theme does not appear on that film's [[soundtrack album]]. Williams later turned the theme into a [[symphonic]] piece performed by the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] featuring a tuba solo by Chester Schmitz. The role of the piece in film and popular culture has become a focus of study by [[musicologist]]s such as Gerald Sloan, who says Williams's piece "blends the monstrous and the lyrical."<ref>Gerald Sloan, "Yuba Meets Jabba: The Expanding Role of Tuba in Film Music", ''TUBA Journal'', quoted in "Evening The Score: UA Professor Explores Tuba Music In Film", [[27 June]] [[2000]], at [http://dailyheadlines.uark.edu/1190.htm University of Arkansas ''Daily Digest'']; last accessed [[July 3]], [[2006]].</ref>

According to film historian Laurent Bouzereau, Jabba the Hutt's death in ''Return of the Jedi'' was suggested by script writer Lawrence Kasdan. Lucas decided Leia should strangle him with her slave chain. He was inspired by a scene from ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972) where an obese character named [[Luca Brasi]] ([[Lenny Montana]]) is [[garrote|garrot]]ed by an assassin.<ref>Bourezeau, ''Annoted Screenplays'', p. 259.</ref>

With the premiere of ''Return of Jedi'' in 1983 and the accompanying merchandising campaign, Jabba the Hutt became an icon in American [[popular culture]]. The character was produced and marketed as a series of action figure playsets by [[Kenner]]/[[Hasbro]] from 1983 to 2004.<ref>A complete Jabba the Hutt playset sold by Kenner in 1983 was valued at $70 in 2003 by collectors if in mint condition and with original packaging. See Geoffrey T Carlton, ''Star Wars Super Collector's Wish Book: Identification & Values'' (Paducah, Ky.: Collector Books, 2003), p. 13, ISBN 1574323342.</ref> In the 1990s, Jabba the Hutt became the protagonist in his own comic book series collectively titled ''Jabba the Hutt: The Art of the Deal''.<ref>Richard von Busack, "Jabba the Hutt slimes his way through a new graphic novel," review of ''Jabba the Hutt: The Art of the Deal'' at [http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/08.06.98/comics-9831.html Metroactive Books].</ref>[[Image:JabbatheHuttPlayset.jpg|right|thumb|Packaging for the Jabba the Hutt action figure playset distributed by [[Kenner]] in 1983 as part of the merchandising campaign for ''Return of the Jedi''.]] 

Jabba's role in popular culture extends beyond the ''Star Wars'' universe and its fans. In [[Mel Brooks]]'s ''Star Wars'' [[spoof]] ''[[Spaceballs]]'' (1987), Jabba the Hutt is [[parody|parodied]] as the character [[Spaceballs#Other villains|Pizza the Hutt]], a cheesy blob shaped like a slice of pizza whose name is a double pun on Jabba the Hutt and the restaurant franchise [[Pizza Hut]]. Like Jabba, Pizza the Hutt is a [[loan shark]] and mobster. The character meets his demise at the end of ''Spaceballs'' when he "[becomes] locked in his car and [eats] himself to death".<ref>''Spaceballs'', dir. Mel Brooks (MGM, 1987).</ref> The [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Air and Space Museum]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], included a display on Jabba the Hutt in the temporary [[Art exhibition|exhibition]] ''Star Wars: The Myth of Magic'', which closed in 1999. Jabba's display was called "The Hero's Return," referencing Luke Skywalker's journey toward becoming a Jedi.<ref>"The Hero's Return", ''Star Wars: The Myth of Magic'' exhibition at [http://www.nasm.si.edu/exhibitions/StarWars/sw-unit12.htm National Air and Space Museum].</ref>

=== Jabba the Hutt in mass media ===

<!--Uncited material/trivia added to this section WILL BE DELETED per Wikipedia:Citing sources and Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden of evidence!-->

Since the release of ''Return of the Jedi'', the name ''Jabba the Hutt'' has become synonymous in American [[mass media]] with repulsive obesity and corruption. The name is frequently utilized as a literary device&mdash;either as a [[simile]] or [[metaphor]]&mdash;to illustrate [[character flaws]]. For example, in ''Under the Duvet'' (2001), [[Marian Keyes]] references a problem with [[gluttony]] when she writes, "wheel out the birthday cake, I feel a Jabba the Hutt moment coming on."<ref>Marian Keyes, ''Under the Duvet: Shoes, Reviews, Having the Blues, Builders, Babies, Families and Other Calamities'' (New York: HarperCollins, 2001), p. 199, ISBN 0060562080.</ref> Likewise, in the novel ''Steps and Exes: A Novel of Family'' (2000), [[Laura Kalpakian]] uses Jabba the Hutt to emphasize the weight of a character's father: "The girls used to call Janice's parents Jabba the Hutt and the Wookie [''sic'']. But then Jabba (Janice's father) died, and it didn't seem right to speak of the dead on those terms."<ref>Laura Kalpakian, ''Steps and Exes: A Novel of Family'' (New York: HarperCollins, 2000), p. 58, ISBN 0380806592.</ref>

In his book of humor and popular culture, ''[[The Dharma of Star Wars]]'' (2005), writer [[Matthew Bortolin]] attempts to show similarities between [[Buddhist]] teachings and aspects of ''Star Wars'' fiction. Bartolin insists that if a person makes decisions that Jabba the Hutt would make, then that person is not practicing the proper spiritual concept of [[dharma]]. Bortolin's book reinforces the idea that Jabba's name is synonymous with negativity:<blockquote>One way to see if we are practicing [[Noble Eightfold Path|right livelihood]] is to compare our trade with that of Jabba the Hutt. Jabba has his fat, stubby fingers in many of the pots that led to the [[Force (Star Wars)#Sith philosophy|dark side]]. He dealt largely in illegal "spice" trade—an illicit drug in the Star Wars galaxy. He also transacts business in the slave trade. He has many slaves himself, and some he fed to the Rancor, a creature he kept caged and tormented in his dungeon. Jabba uses deception and violence to maintain his position.<ref>Matthew Bortolin, ''The Dharma of Star Wars'' (Somerville, Mass.: Wisdom Publications, 2005), p. 139, ISBN 0861714970.</ref></blockquote>

Outside literature, the character's name has become an insulting [[term of disparagement]]. To say that someone "looks like Jabba the Hutt" is commonly understood as a slur to impugn that person's weight and/or appearance.<ref name="FatWars">For example, see "Fat Wars: The Obesity Empire Strikes Back" at [http://www.consumerfreedom.com/news_detail.cfm/headline/2812 Center for Consumer Freedom].</ref> The term is often employed by the media as an attack on prominent figures. For instance, actress and comedian [[Roseanne Barr|Roseanne]] endured what W. C. Goodman called "vitriolic attacks based on her weight" at the hands of ''[[New York Observer]]'' columnist Michael Thomas who often compared her with "''Star Wars'' blob monster" Jabba the Hutt.<ref>W. C. Goodman, ''The Invisible Woman: Confronting Weight Prejudice in America'' (Carlsbad Calif.: Gürze Books, 1995), p. 57, ISBN 0936077107.</ref> In an episode of the animated television series ''[[South Park]]'' titled "[[Starvin' Marvin in Space]]" that aired in 1999, [[Christian Children's Fund]] spokeswoman [[Sally Struthers]] is portrayed as the Hutt and accused of gorging herself on food relief meant for starving [[Ethiopians]].<ref>"Starvin' Marvin in Space", Episode 311, ''South Park'', 17 November 1999 (DVD, Paramount, 2003).</ref>[[Image:311 sallys.jpeg|left|thumb|Actress and spokeswoman [[Sally Struthers]] is parodied as Jabba the Hutt in an episode of ''[[South Park]]'' in 1999.]]

In another sense of the term, Jabba the Hutt has come to represent greed and [[anarchism|anarchy]], especially in the business world.<ref name="Kuiper">Koenraad Kuiper, "Star Wars: An Imperial Myth," ''Journal of Popular Culture'' 21.4 (Spring 1988): p. 78.</ref> For instance, [[Michael Jordan]] biographer Mitchell Krugel uses the term to disparage [[Chicago Bulls]]'s general manager [[Jerry Krause]] after Krause made a comment about Jordan and other players' multi-million dollar contracts: "Krause added to his Jabba the Hutt image during the media gathering that preceded the opening of camp when he answered a question about the prospect of rebuilding the Bulls without [[Phil Jackson|Phil]] or Michael in the imminent future by saying, 'Organizations win championships. Players and coaches are parts of organizations'."<ref>Mitchell Krugel, ''One Last Shot: The Story of Michael Jordan's Comeback'' (New York: St. Martin's Press, 2003), p. 55, ISBN 0312992238.</ref> 

Jabba the Hutt has likewise become a popular means of caricature in American politics. For example, opponents of [[California]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] legislator [[Jackie Goldberg]] commonly depict the politician as the ''Star Wars'' character. The ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]'' has caricatured her in cartoons as a grotesquely overweight Jabba the Hutt-like figure and the ''[[New Times LA]]'' referred to Goldberg as "a human Jabba the Hutt who consumes the good while producing the bad."<ref>Patrick Mallon, ''California Dictatorship'' (Philadelphia: Xlibris, 2004), p. 235, ISBN 1413467970.</ref> [[William Ouchi|William G. Ouchi]] uses the term to describe what he sees as the ineffecient [[bureaucracy]] of the public school system: "With all of these unnecessary layers of organizational fat, school districts have come to resemble Jabba the Hutt—the pirate leader in ''Star Wars''."<ref>William G. Ouchi, ''Making Schools Work: A Revolutionary Plan to Get Your Children the Education They Need'' (New York: Simon and Schuster, 2003), p. 96, ISBN 0743246306.</ref>
