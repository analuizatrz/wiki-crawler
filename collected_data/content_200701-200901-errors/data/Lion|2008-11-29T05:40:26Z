The '''lion''' (''Panthera leo'') is a member of the family [[Felidae]] and one of four [[big cat]]s in the [[genus]] ''[[Panthera]]''. With exceptionally large males exceeding 250 kg (550&nbsp;[[pound (mass)|lb]]) in weight,<ref name = "nowak"/> it is the second-heaviest living cat after the [[tiger]]. Wild lions currently exist in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and in [[Asia]] with a [[critically endangered species|critically endangered]] remnant population in northwest [[India]], having disappeared from [[North Africa]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Southwest Asia|Western Asia]] in historic times. Until the late [[Pleistocene]] (about 10,000&nbsp;years ago), the lion was the most widespread large land mammal beside humans. They were found in most of Africa, much of Eurasia from western Europe to India and, in the Americas, from the [[Yukon]] to [[Peru]].

Should they survive the rigors of cubhood, lionesses in secure habitat such as [[Kruger National Park]] may frequently reach an age of 12–14 years whereas lions seldom live for longer than 8 years.<ref>{{cite book |last=Smuts |first=G.L. |year=1982 |title=Lion|publisher=Macmillian South Africa (Publishers)(Pty.) Ltd.|location=Johannesburg |pages=p. 231|isbn= 0-86954-122-6}}</ref> However, there are records of lionesses living for up to 20 years in the wild. In captivity both male and female lions can live for over 20 years. They typically inhabit [[savanna]] and [[grassland]], although they may take to bush and [[forest]]. Lions are unusually [[social animal|social]] compared to other cats. A pride of lions consists of related females and offspring and a small number of adult males. Groups of female lions typically hunt together, preying mostly on large [[ungulate]]s. The lion is an [[apex predator|apex]] and [[keystone species#Predators|keystone predator]], although they will resort to scavenging if the opportunity arises. While lions, in general, do not selectively hunt humans, some have been known to become man-eaters and seek human prey.

The lion is a [[vulnerable species]], having seen a possibly irreversible population decline of 30 to 50 percent over the past two decades in its African range;<ref name=IUCN>{{IUCN2006|assessors=Nowell & Bauer|year=2004|id=15951|title=Panthera leo|downloaded=11 May 2006}} Database entry includes a lengthy justification of why this species is vulnerable </ref> populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not well understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are currently the greatest causes of concern. Lions have been kept in [[menagerie]]s since [[Roman era|Roman times]] and have been a key species sought after and exhibited in [[zoo]]s the world over since the late eighteenth century. Zoos are cooperating worldwide in breeding programs for the endangered [[Asiatic Lion|Asiatic subspecies]].

Visually, the male is highly distinctive and is easily recognized by its [[#mane|mane]]. The head of the male lion is one of the most widely recognized animal symbols in human [[culture]]. It has been depicted extensively in literature, in [[sculpture]]s, in [[painting]]s, on national [[flag]]s, and in contemporary films and literature.

The lioness has been recognized, however, as the pinnacle of hunting prowess from the earliest of human writings and graphic representations. The lionesses are the hunters for their pride and capture their prey with precise and complex teamwork. Each lioness develops specific skills for her role in the hunting techniques used by her pride and, generally, assumes that role during most hunts. Members of human cultures living among lions in natural habitats have understood this characteristic and often have chosen the lioness to represent their most ferocious [[List of war deities|war deities]] and [[warrior]]s, often naming their male rulers as her "son". Examples drawn from the earliest of written records include the [[Egyptian pantheon]] deities of [[Sekhmet]], [[Bast (mythology)|Bast]], [[Menhit]], and [[Tefnut]], and these deities may have had precursors in [[Nubia]] and [[Libya|Lybia]]. Other Egyptian deities are quite complex and assume aspects that may include one as a lioness headed human or a lioness in specific roles. Depictions of lions hunting in groups have existed from the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period, with carvings and paintings from the [[Lascaux]] and [[Chauvet Cave]]s.

==Naming and etymology==
The lion's name, similar in many Romance languages, derives from the [[Latin]] ''leo''<ref>{{cite book | author=Simpson DP | title=Cassell's Latin Dictionary | publisher=Cassell Ltd. | year=1979 | edition=5th edition | location=London | pages=p. 883 | isbn=0-304-52257-0}}</ref>; cf. the [[Ancient Greek]] ''λέων'' (''leon'')<ref name="Liddell 1980">{{cite book | author=[[Henry George Liddell|Liddell, Henry George]] and [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Robert Scott]] | year=1980 | title=[[A Greek-English Lexicon]] (Abridged Edition) | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | location=United Kingdom | isbn=0-19-910207-4}}</ref>.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
[[Image:Panthera leo Kruger Skull.jpg|thumb|left|Skull of a modern lion at [[Kruger National Park]]]]
The oldest lion-like [[fossil]] is known from [[Laetoli]] in [[Tanzania]] and is perhaps 3.5&nbsp;million years old; some scientists have identified the material as ''Panthera leo''. These records are not well-substantiated, and all that can be said is that they pertain to a ''Panthera''-like felid. The oldest confirmed records of ''Panthera leo'' in [[Africa]] are about 2&nbsp;million years younger.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Werdelin |first=Lars |coauthors=Lewis, Margaret E. |year=2005 |month=June |title=Plio-Pleistocene Carnivora of eastern Africa: species richness and turnover patterns |journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=144|issue=2 |pages=121–144 |publisher=The Linnean Society of London |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bsc/zoj/2005/00000144/00000002/art00001 |accessdate=2007-07-08 |doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.2005.00165.x}}</ref>
The closest relatives of the lion are the other ''[[Panthera]]'' species: the [[tiger]], the [[jaguar]], and the [[leopard]]. Morphological and genetic studies reveal that the tiger was the first of these recent species to diverge. About 1.9&nbsp;million years ago the jaguar branched off the remaining group, which contained ancestors of the [[leopard]] and lion. The lion and leopard subsequently separated about 1 to 1.25&nbsp;million years ago from each other.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Yu |first=Li |coauthors=Ya-ping Zhang |month=May |year=2003 |title=Phylogenetic studies of pantherine cats (Felidae) based on multiple genes, with novel application of nuclear β-fibrinogen intron 7 to carnivores |journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=483–495 |doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2005.01.017}}</ref>

''Panthera leo'' itself evolved in [[Africa]] between 1 million and 800,000 years ago before spreading throughout the [[Holarctic]] region.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Yamaguchi |first=Nobuyuki| coauthors=Alan Cooper, Lars Werdelin and David W.

===Subspecies===
[[Image:P l Bleyenberghi.jpg|thumb|upright|Southwest African lion (''Panthera leo bleyenberghi'')]]
Traditionally 12 recent [[subspecies]] of lion were recognized, the largest of which has been recognized as the [[Barbary Lion]].<ref>[http://www.tigerhomes.org/animal/barbary-lion.cfm Barbary Lion - Panthera leo leo - Largest Lion Subspecies] Retrieved on 19 September 2007</ref> The major differences between these subspecies are location, mane appearance, size, and distribution. Because these characteristics are very insignificant and show a high individual variability, most of these forms were debatable and probably invalid; additionally, they were often based upon zoo material of unknown origin that may have had "striking, but abnormal" morphological characteristics.<ref name="zoos_encyclopedia">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Grisham |first=Jack |editor=Catherine E.

Even the remaining seven subspecies might be too much; [[mitochondria]]l variation in recent African lions is modest, which suggests that all Sub-Saharan lions could be considered a single subspecies, possibly divided in two main clades: one to the west of the [[Great Rift Valley]] and the other to the east. Lions from [[Tsavo]] in Eastern Kenya are much closer genetically to lions in [[Transvaal]] (South Africa), than to those in the [[Aberdare Range]] in Western Kenya.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Barnett |first=Ross |coauthors=Nobuyuki Yamaguchi, Ian Barnes and Alan Cooper |year=2006 |title=The origin, current diversity and future conservation of the modern lion (''Panthera leo'') |journal= Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=273 |issue=1598 |pages=2119–2125 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2006.3555 |url= http://www.adelaide.edu.au/acad/publications/papers/Barnett%20PRS%20lions.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=2007-09-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Dubach |first=Jean| coauthors=et ''al'' |year=2005 |month=January |title=Molecular genetic variation across the southern and eastern geographic ranges of the African lion, ''Panthera leo'' |journal=Conservation Genetics |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=15–24 |doi=10.1007/s10592-004-7729-6}}</ref>

====Recent====
Eight recent subspecies are recognized today:
* '''''P. l. persica''''', known as the '''[[Asiatic Lion]]''' or '''South Asian, Persian, or Indian lion''', was once widespread from [[Turkey]], across the [[Middle East]], to [[Pakistan]], [[India]], and even [[Bangladesh]]. However, large prides and daylight activity made it easier to poach than tigers or leopards; now around 300 exist in and near the [[Gir Forest National Park|Gir Forest]] of India.<ref name ="Asiaticweb">{{cite web | author=Wildlife Conservation Trust of India | title=Asiatic Lion - History | work=Asiatic Lion Information Centre | publisher=Wildlife Conservation Trust of India | year=2006 | url=http://www.asiaticlion.org/asiatic-lion-history.htm | accessdate=2007-09-15}}</ref>
* '''''P. l. leo''''', known as the '''[[Barbary Lion]]''', is extinct in the wild due to excessive hunting, although captive individuals may still exist. This was one of the largest of the lion subspecies, at approximately 3–3.5 metres (10–11.5&nbsp;ft) long and weighing over {{convert|150|kg|lb}}. They ranged from Morocco to Egypt. The last wild Barbary Lion was killed in Morocco in 1922.<ref name=CAP>{{cite book |author=Nowell K, Jackson P |title= Wild Cats: Status Survey and Conservation Action

* '''''P. l. senegalensis''''', known as the '''West African lion''', is found in Western Africa, from Senegal to Nigeria.
* '''''P. l. azandica''''', known as the '''North East Congo lion''', is found in the North-eastern parts of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]].
* '''''P. l. nubica''''', known as the '''East African Lion''' or '''Massai lion''', is found in East Africa, from [[Ethiopia]] and Kenya to [[Tanzania]] and [[Mozambique]].
* '''''P. l. bleyenberghi''''', known as the '''Southwest African lion''' or '''Katanga lion'''. It is found in South-western Africa, [[Namibia]], [[Botswana]], [[Angola]], [[Katanga Province|Katanga]] ([[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Zaire]]), [[Zambia]], and [[Zimbabwe]].
* '''''P. l. krugeri''''', known as the '''Southeast African lion''' or '''Transvaal lion''', is found in the [[Transvaal]] region of South eastern Africa, including [[Kruger National Park]].
* '''''P. l. melanochaita''''', known as the '''[[Cape Lion]]''', became extinct in the wild around 1860. Results of [[mitochondrial DNA]] research do not support the status as a distinct subspecies. It seems probable that the Cape lion was only the southernmost population of the extant southern African lion.<ref name="Conservation-Genetics:Preserving-Genetic-Diversity" />

====Prehistoric====
Several additional subspecies of lion existed in prehistoric times:
<!-- prose form please -->
* '''''P. l. atrox''''', known as the '''[[American Lion]]''' or '''American cave lion''', was abundant in the Americas from [[Alaska]] to [[Peru]] in the Pleistocene Epoch until about 10,000 years ago. This form as well as the cave lion are sometimes considered to represent separate species, but recent phylogenetic studies suggest that they are in fact subspecies of the lion (''Panthera leo'').<ref name="BurgerJ-Molecular-phylogeny" /> One of the largest lion subspecies to have existed, its body length is estimated to have been 1.6–2.5&nbsp;m (5–8&nbsp;ft).<ref name="Quaternary extinctions">{{cite book |last=Martin |first=P.S. |title=Quaternary Extinctions |year=1984 |publisher= University of Arizona Press|location= Tucson, Arizona|isbn=0-8165-1100-4 }}</ref>
* '''''P. l. fossilis''''', known as the '''[[Panthera leo fossilis|Early Middle Pleistocene European cave lion]]''', flourished about 500,000 years ago; fossils have been recovered from [[Germany]] and [[Italy]]. <!--(commented out until I can find a ref!!) It was larger than today's African lions, with a maximum head and body length of 2.40&nbsp;m (8&nbsp;ft).{{Fact|date=July 2007}}--> [[Image:Lascaux-diverticule-félins.jpg|thumb|300px||right|[[Cave Lion]]s, Chamber of Felines, [[Lascaux]] caves]]
* '''''P. l. spelaea''''', known as the '''[[Cave Lion|European cave lion]]''', Eurasian cave lion, or Upper Pleistocene European cave lion, occurred in Eurasia 300,000 to 10,000 years ago.<ref name="BurgerJ-Molecular-phylogeny" /> This species is known from [[Paleolithic]] [[cave painting]]s (such as the one displayed to the right), [[ivory]] carvings, and clay busts, <ref name="Packer00">{{cite journal | last=Packer | first=Craig | coauthors=Jean Clottes | title=When Lions Ruled France | journal=Natural History | volume=| issue=| pages=52–57 | month=November | year=2000 | url=http://www.lionresearch.org/current_docs/m_pdf/36.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate=2007-08-27}}</ref> indicating it had protruding ears, tufted tails, perhaps faint tiger-like stripes, and that at least some males had a ''ruff'' or primitive mane around their necks.<ref name ="Koenigswald02"/> With this example being a hunting scene it is likely that it depicts females hunting for the pride using the same strategy as their contemporary relatives and males may not be part of the subject. 
* '''''P. l. vereshchagini''''', known as the '''East Siberian-''' or '''[[Beringian cave lion]]''', was found in [[Sakha Republic|Yakutia]] ([[Russia]]), [[Alaska]] ([[United States|USA]]), and the [[Yukon|Yukon Territory]] ([[Canada]]). Analysis of skulls and mandibles of this lion demonstrate that it is distinct—larger than the European cave lion and smaller than the American cave lion with differing [[skull]] proportions.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Baryshnikov|first=G.F. |coauthors=G.

====Dubious====
* '''''P. l. sinhaleyus''''', known as the '''[[Sri Lanka Lion]]''', appears to have become extinct [[circa|around]] 39,000 years ago. It is only known from two teeth found in deposits at [[Kuruwita]]. Based on these teeth, P. Deraniyagala erected this subspecies in 1939.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kelum Manamendra-Arachchi, Rohan Pethiyagoda, Rajith Dissanayake, Madhava Meegaskumbura |year=2005 |month= |title=A second extinct big cat from the late Quaternary of Sri Lanka. |journal=The Raffles Bulletin of Zoology Supplement |volume=12 |pages=423–434 |id= |url=http://rmbr.nus.edu.sg/rbz/biblio/s12/s12rbz423-434.pdf|publisher=National University of Singapore |accessdate= 2007-07-31|format=PDF}}</ref>
* '''''P. l. europaea''''', known as the '''[[European Lion]]''', was probably identical with ''Panthera leo persica'' or ''Panthera leo spelea''; its status as a subspecies is unconfirmed. It became extinct around 100 AD due to persecution and over-exploitation. It inhabited the [[Balkans]], the [[Italian Peninsula]], southern [[France]] and the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. It was a very popular object of hunting among [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[ancient Greece|Greeks]], and [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]]. 
* '''''P. l. youngi''''' or ''Panthera youngi'' , known as the '''[[Panthera youngi|North-Eastern Pleistocene China cave lion]]''', flourished 350,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Harington |first=CR |year=1969 |title=Pleistocene remains of the lion-like cat (''Panthera atrox'') from the Yukon Territory and northern Alaska |journal=Canadian Journal Earth Sciences |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=1277–1288 }}</ref> Its relationship to the extant lion subspecies is obscure, and it probably represents a distinct species.
*'''''P. l. maculatus''''', known as the '''[[Marozi]]''' or '''Spotted lion''', is sometimes believed to be a distinct subspecies, but may be an adult lion that has retained its juvenile spotted pattern. If it was a subspecies in its own right, rather than a small number of aberrantly colored individuals, it has been extinct since 1931. A less likely identity is a natural leopard/lion [[Panthera hybrid|hybrid]] commonly known as a [[leopon]].<ref name="shuker">{{cite book | last=Shuker | first=Karl P.N. | authorlink=Karl Shuker | title=Mystery Cats of the World | publisher=Robert Hale | year=1989 | isbn=0-7090-3706-6}}</ref>

===Hybrids===
{{further|[[Panthera hybrid]], [[liger]], and [[tigon]]}}
[[Image:bertramliger.jpg|thumb|left|A [[liger]] is the offspring of a female tiger and male lion.]]
Lions have been known to [[biological reproduction|breed]] with [[tiger]]s (most often the [[Siberian Tiger|Siberian]] and [[Bengal Tiger|Bengal]] subspecies) to create hybrids called [[liger]]s and [[tigon]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Guggisberg |first=C.

The [[marozi]] is reputedly a spotted lion or a naturally occurring leopon, while the [[Congolese Spotted Lion]] is a complex lion/jaguar/leopard hybrid called a '''lijagulep'''. Such hybrids were once commonly bred in zoos, but this is now discouraged due to the emphasis on conserving species and subspecies. Hybrids are still bred in private menageries and in zoos in [[China]].

Males have about a 50 percent chance of having a mane, but if they grow one their manes will be modest: around 50 percent of a pure lion mane. Ligers are typically between 3.0 and 3.7&nbsp;m (10 to 12 feet) in length, and can be between 360 and 450&nbsp;kg (800 to 1,000 pounds) or more.<ref name="liger" /> The less common tigon is a cross between the lioness and the male tiger.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9001344/tigon|title= tigon - Encyclopædia Britannica Article|accessdaymonth=12 September|accessyear=2007}}</ref> <!--(commented out - not really necessary - can reinsert when ref arises) Because the male tiger does not pass on a growth-promoting gene and the lioness passes on a growth inhibiting gene, tigons are often relatively small, only weighing up to 150 kilograms (350 lb),{{Fact|date=August 2007}} which is about 20 percent smaller than lions.

==Physical characteristics==
[[Image:HansomeLion 002.jpg|thumb|left|During confrontations with others, the mane makes the lion look bigger than he really is.]]
The lion is the tallest (at the shoulder) of the felines, and is also the second-heaviest feline after the [[tiger]]. With powerful legs, a strong [[jaw]], and {{convert|8|cm|in|abbr=on}} long canine [[teeth]], the lion can bring down and kill large prey.<ref name=Honolulu>{{cite web |url=http://www.honoluluzoo.org/lion.htm |title=Lion |accessdate=2007-07-12 |publisher=Honolulu Zoo}}</ref> Lion coloration varies from light buff to yellowish, reddish or dark ochraceous brown. The underparts are generally lighter and the tail tuft is black. Lion cubs are born with brown rosettes (spots) on their body, rather like those of a leopard. Although these fade as lions reach adulthood, faint spots can still often be seen on the legs and underparts, particularly on lionesses. 

Lions are the only members of the cat family to display obvious [[sexual dimorphism]]—that is, males and females look distinctly different, as a consequence of the specialized roles that each play in the pride. For instance, the lioness, as the hunter, lacks the male's thick mane, which would impede her ability to camouflage when stalking the prey. The color of the male's mane varies from blond to black, generally becoming darker as the lion grows older.

Weights for adult lions generally lie between 150–250&nbsp;kg (330–550&nbsp;lb) for males and 120–182&nbsp;kg (264–400&nbsp;lb) for females.<ref name="nowak">{{cite book |last=Nowak |first= Ronald M. |year=1999 |title=Walker's Mammals of the World |location=Baltimore |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=0-8018-5789-9}}</ref> Nowell and Jackson report average weights of 181&nbsp;kg for males and 126&nbsp;kg for females; one male shot near [[Mount Kenya]] was weighed at 272&nbsp;kg (600&nbsp;lb).<ref name=CAP>{{cite book |author=Nowell K, Jackson P |title= Wild Cats: Status Survey and Conservation Action

In both males and females, the tail ends in a hairy tuft. In some lions, the tuft conceals a hard "spine" or "spur", approximately 5&nbsp;mm long, formed of the final sections of tail bone fused together. The lion is the only felid to have a tufted tail—the function of the tuft and spine are unknown. Absent at birth, the tuft develops around 5½&nbsp;months of age and is  readily identifiable at 7&nbsp;months.<ref name ="Schaller28">Schaller, p. 28</ref>

====Mane====
[[Image:wiki lion.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Thermography|Thermographic]] image of a lion, showing the insulating mane]]
The mane of the male lion, unique amongst cats, is one of the most distinctive characteristics of the species. It makes the lion appear larger, providing an excellent intimidation display; this aids the lion during confrontations with other lions and with the species' chief competitor in Africa, the [[spotted hyena]].<ref>

Scientists once believed that the distinct status of some subspecies could be justified by [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], including the size of the mane. Morphology was used to identify subspecies such as the [[Barbary Lion]] and [[Cape Lion]]. Research has suggested, however, that environmental factors influence the color and size of a lion's mane, such as the [[room temperature|ambient temperature]].<ref name=West/> The cooler ambient temperature in European and North American [[zoo]]s, for example, can result in a heavier mane.

[[Image:Maneless lion from Tsavo East National Park.png|thumb|left|A maneless male lion, who also has little body hair—from Tsavo East National Park, Kenya]]
Maneless male lions have been reported in [[Senegal]] and [[Tsavo East National Park]] in Kenya, and the original male white lion from Timbavati also was maneless. [[castration|Castrated]] lions have minimal manes. The lack of a mane is sometimes found in inbred lion populations; inbreeding also results in poor fertility.<ref>{{cite web | last=Trivedi | first =Bijal P. | title=To Boost Gene Pool, Lions Artificially Inseminated | work=National Geographic News | publisher=National Geographic | date=12 June 2002 | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/06/0612_020612_TVlion.html| accessdate= 2007-09-20}}</ref> 

[[Image:Lightmatter lioness.jpg|thumb|Lioness showing the ruff that sometimes leads to misidentification as a male]]
Many lionesses have a ''ruff'' that may be apparent in certain poses. Sometimes it is indicated in sculptures and drawings, especially ancient artwork, and is misinterpreted as a male mane. It differs from a mane, however, in being at the jaw line below the ears, of much less hair length, and frequently not noticeable, whereas a mane extends above the ears, often obscuring their outline entirely. 

[[Cave painting]]s of extinct European [[Cave Lion]]s exclusively show animals with no mane, or just the hint of a mane, suggesting to some that they were more or less maneless;<ref name ="Koenigswald02">{{de icon}} {{cite book |last=Koenigswald |first=Wighart von |year=2002 |title=Lebendige Eiszeit: Klima und Tierwelt im Wandel |location=Stuttgart |publisher=Theiss |isbn=3-8062-1734-3| pages=}}</ref> however, females hunting for a pride are the likely subjects of the drawings—since they are shown in a group related to hunting—so these images do not enable a reliable judgment about whether the males had manes. The drawings do suggest that the extinct species used the same social organization and hunting strategies as contemporary lions.

====White lions====
[[Image:White Lion.jpg|thumb|right|[[White lion]]s owe their coloring to a recessive gene; they are rare forms of the subspecies ''Panthera leo krugeri'']]
The [[white lion]] is not a distinct subspecies, but a special [[Polymorphism (biology)|morph]] with a genetic condition, [[leucism]],<ref name="zoos_encyclopedia"/> that causes paler colouration akin to that of the [[white tiger]]; the condition is similar to [[melanism]], which causes [[black panther]]s. White Transvaal lion ''(Panthera leo krugeri)'' individuals occasionally have been  encountered in and around [[Kruger National Park]] and the adjacent [[Timbavati Private Game Reserve]] in eastern South Africa, but are more commonly found in [[captivity (animal)|captivity]], where breeders deliberately select them. The unusual cream color of their coats is due to a [[recessive gene]].<ref>{{cite book |last=McBride |first=Chris |title=The White Lions of Timbavati |year=1977 |publisher=E. Stanton |location=Johannesburg |isbn= 0-949997-32-3 }}</ref> Reportedly, they have been bred in camps in South Africa for use as trophies for [[canned hunt]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Tucker|first=Linda |title=Mystery of the White Lions—Children of the Sun God|year=2003 |publisher=Npenvu Press|location=Mapumulanga |isbn= 0-620-31409-5}}</ref>

Confirmation of the existence of white lions only came in the late twentieth century. For hundreds of years prior, the white lion had been thought to be a figment of legend circulating in South Africa, the white [[pelage]] of the animal said to represent the goodness in all creatures. Sightings were first reported in the early 1900s, and continued, infrequently, for almost fifty years until, in 1975, a litter of white lion cubs was found at Timbavati Game Reserve.<ref name="whitelion">[http://www.lairweb.org.nz/tiger/lions.html The rare white lions] Retrieved on 20 September 2007.</ref>

==Biology and behavior==
Lions spend much of their time resting and are inactive for about 20&nbsp;hours per day.<ref name="Schaller122">Schaller, p. 122</ref> Although lions can be active at any time, their activity generally peaks after dusk with a period of socializing, grooming and defecating. Intermittent bursts of activity follow through the night hours to dawn, when hunting most often takes place. They spend an average of two hours a day walking and 50&nbsp;minutes eating.<ref name="Schaller120">Schaller, p. 120–121</ref>

===Group organization===
[[Image:Pride of lions.JPG|thumb|250px|A pride on the move near Governors Camp, in the Massai Mara, Kenya]]
Lions are predatory [[carnivore]]s who manifest two types of social organization. Some are ''residents,'' living in groups, called ''prides''.<ref name ="Schaller33">Schaller, p. 33</ref> The pride usually consists of approximately five or six related females, their cubs of both sexes, and one or two males known as a ''coalition'' who mate with the adult females (although extremely large prides, consisting of up to 30 individuals, have been observed). The coalition of males associated with a pride are usually two, but may increase to four and decrease again over time. Male cubs are excluded from their maternal pride when they reach maturity.

The second organizational behaviour is labeled ''nomads'', who range widely and move about sporadically, either singularly or in pairs.<ref name ="Schaller33"/> Pairs are more frequent among related males who have been excluded from their birth pride. Note that a lion may switch lifestyles; nomads may become residents and vice versa. Males have to go through this lifestyle and some never are able to join another pride. A female who becomes a nomad has much greater difficulty joining a new pride, as the females in a pride are related and reject most attempts by an unrelated female to join their family group. 

The area a pride occupies is called a ''pride area'', whereas that by a nomad is a ''range''.<ref name ="Schaller33"/> The males associated with a pride tend to stay on the fringes, patrolling their territory. Why [[Social behavior|sociality]]—the most pronounced in any cat species—has developed in lionesses is the subject of much debate. Increased hunting success appears an obvious reason, but this is less than sure upon examination: coordinated hunting does allow for more successful predation, but also ensures that non-hunting "cheaters" reduce per capita caloric intake. Other benefits include possible [[kin selection]] (better to share food with a related lion than with a stranger), protection of the young, maintenance of territory, and individual insurance against injury and hunger.<ref name=CAP/>

[[Image:Serengeti Lion Running saturated.jpg|thumb|250px|Lioness in a burst of speed while hunting in the Serengeti]] 
Lionesses do the majority of the hunting for their pride, being smaller, swifter and more agile than the males, and unencumbered by the heavy and conspicuous mane, which causes overheating during exertion. They act as a co-ordinated group in order to successfully stalk and bring down the prey. However, males have a tendency to dominate the kill once the lionesses have succeeded (they are actually more likely to share the kill with the cubs than with the lionesses), and rarely share food they have killed by themselves. Smaller prey is eaten at the location of the hunt, thereby being shared among the hunters; when the kill is larger it often is dragged to the pride area. There is more sharing with larger kills<ref name ="Schaller133">Schaller, p. 133</ref>, although pride members still often behave aggressively towards each other as they each try to consume as much food as they can. 
 
Both males and females defend the pride against intruders. Some individual lions consistently lead the defense against intruders, while others lag behind.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Heinsohn|first= R. |coauthors= C. Packer|year=1995 |title=Complex cooperative strategies in group-territorial African lions |journal=Science |volume=269 |issue=5228 |pages=1260–1262 |doi=10.1126/science.7652573 |pmid=7652573}}</ref> These "laggards" are not punished by leaders.

===Hunting and diet===
[[Image:Female Lion.JPG|thumb|right|While a lioness such as this has very sharp teeth, prey is usually killed by strangulation]]
Lions are powerful animals who usually hunt in coordinated groups and stalk their chosen prey. However, they are not particularly known for their stamina - for instance, a lioness' heart makes up only 0.57 percent of her body weight (a male's is about 0.45 percent of his body weight), whereas a hyena's heart is close to 1 percent of its body weight.<ref name ="Schaller39">Schaller, p. 248</ref> Thus, although lionesses can reach speeds of  {{convert|59|km/h|mi/h|-1|abbr=on}},<ref name="Schaller233">Schaller, p. 233</ref> they can only do so for short bursts<ref name="Schaller2478">Schaller, p. 247–248</ref> so they have to be close to their prey before starting the attack. They take advantage of factors that reduce visibility; many kills take place near some form of cover or at night.<ref name="Schaller237">Schaller, p. 237</ref> They sneak up to the victim until they reach a distance of approximately 30&nbsp;metres (98 ft) or less. Typically, several female lions work together and encircle the herd from different points. Once they have closed with a herd, they usually target the closest prey. The attack is short and powerful; they attempt to catch the victim with a fast rush and final leap. The prey is usually killed by [[strangulation]],<ref>{{cite web |title=About lions—Ecology and behaviour |author=Dr Gus Mills |publisher=African Lion Working Group |url=http://www.african-lion.org/lions_e.htm |accessdate=2007-07-20 }}</ref> which can cause [[cerebral ischemia]] or [[asphyxia]] (which results in [[hypoxemia|hypoxemic]], or "general," [[hypoxia]]). The prey may also be killed by the lion enclosing the animal's mouth and nostrils in its jaws<ref name="nowak">Ronald M. Nowak: ''Walker's Mammals of the World''.</ref> (which would also result in asphyxia). Smaller prey, though, may simply be killed by a swipe of a lion's paw.<ref name="nowak"/>

The [[predation|prey]] consists mainly of large mammals, with a preference for [[wildebeest]], [[impala]]s, [[zebra]]s, [[African Buffalo|buffalo]], and [[warthog]]s in Africa and [[nilgai]], [[boar|wild boar]], and several deer species in India. Many other species are hunted, based on availability. Mainly this will include [[ungulate]]s weighing between 50 and 300 kg (110–660&nbsp;lb) such as [[kudu]], [[hartebeest]], [[gemsbok]], and [[taurotragus|eland]].<ref name="nowak"/> Occasionally, they take relatively small species such as [[Thomson's Gazelle]] or [[Springbok (antelope)|springbok]]. Lions living near the [[Namib Desert|Namib]] coast feed extensively on [[pinniped|seal]]s.<ref>[http://www.5050.co.za/inserts.asp?ID=8258 50/50—SA's top enviro tv programme<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Lions hunting in groups are capable of taking down most animals, even healthy adults, but they rarely attack very large prey such as [[African Buffalo|buffalo]] bulls or fully grown male [[giraffe]]s due to the danger of injury.<ref name="home">{{citeweb|url=http://home.intekom.com/ecotravel/Guides/Wildlife/Vertebrates/Mammals/Big_5/Lion/african-lion-hunting-habits.htm |title=African Lion Hunting Habits in South Africa and Southern Africa|accessdaymonth=31 July|accessyear=2007}}</ref> 

[[Image:7 lions.jpg|thumb|left|240px|right|7 lions along the road in the [[Masai Mara]] park reserve in [[Kenya]]]]
Extensive statistics collected over various studies show that lions normally feed on mammals in the range 190–550 kg (420–1210&nbsp;lb). Wildebeest rank at the top of peferred prey (making nearly half of the lion prey in the [[Serengeti]]) followed by zebra.<ref>''The Art of Being a Lion'' pg 186, Christine and Michel Denis-Huot, Friedman/Fairfax, 2002</ref> Most adult [[hippopotamus]]es, [[rhinoceros]]es, [[elephant]]s, and smaller [[gazelle]]s, [[impala]], and other agile antelopes are generally excluded.

[[Image:Lions and a Zebra b.jpg|thumb|200px|The hunters of a pride sharing a zebra where the kill occurred]]
Because lionesses hunt in open spaces where they are easily seen by their prey, cooperative hunting increases the likelihood of a successful hunt; this is especially true with larger species. Teamwork also enables them to defend their kills more easily against other large predators such as hyenas, which may be attracted by [[vulture]]s from kilometers away in open savannas. Lionesses do most of the hunting. In typical hunts, each lioness has a favored position in the group, either stalking prey on the "wing" then attacking, or moving a smaller distance in the centre of the group and capturing prey in flight from other lionesses.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Stander, P. E.|title=Cooperative hunting in lions: the role of the individual|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume=29|issue=6|pages=445–454|year=1992|doi=10.1007/BF00170175}}</ref>

Males attached to prides do not usually participate in hunting, except in the case of larger quarry such as giraffe and buffalo. Bachelor male lions without a pride of their own are forced to hunt. Male lions have also been observed and recorded hunting in groups.{{Fact|date=March 2008}} 

Young lions first display stalking behavior around three months of age, although they do not participate in hunting until they are almost a year old. They begin to hunt effectively when nearing the age of two.<ref name="Schaller153">Schaller, p. 153</ref>

===Reproduction and life cycle===
Most lionesses will have reproduced by the time they are four years of age.<ref name ="Schaller29">Schaller, p. 29</ref> Lions do not [[mating|mate]] at any specific time of year, and the females are [[Estrous cycle#Frequency|polyestrous]].<ref name ="Schaller174">Schaller, p. 174</ref> As with other cats, the male lion's penis has spines which point backwards. Upon withdrawal of the penis, the spines rake the walls of the female's vagina, which may cause ovulation.<ref>{{cite book |last=Asdell |first=Sydney A. |title=Patterns of mammalian reproduction |year=1993|origyear= 1964 |publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca |isbn=978-0-8014-1753-5}}</ref> A lioness may mate with more than one male when she is [[Estrous cycle|in heat]];<ref name ="Schaller142">Schaller, p. 142</ref> during a mating bout, which could last several days, the couple copulates twenty to forty times a day and are likely to forgo eating. Lions reproduce very well in captivity.

[[Image:Lion pair2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|During a mating bout, a couple may copulate twenty to forty times a day for several days; the ruff of the female is clearly visible]]
The average gestation period is around 110&nbsp;days,<ref name ="Schaller174"/> the female giving birth to a litter of one to four cubs in a secluded den (which may be a thicket, a reed-bed, a cave or some other sheltered area) usually away from the rest of the pride. She will often hunt by herself whilst the cubs are still helpless, staying relatively close to the thicket or den where the cubs are kept. <ref name="Scott">Scott, Jonathon; Scott, Angela. (2002), ''Big Cat Diary: Lion'', p. 45</ref> The cubs themselves are born blind—their eyes do not open until roughly a week after birth. They weigh 1.2–2.1&nbsp;kg (2.6–4.6&nbsp;lb) at birth and are almost helpless, beginning to crawl a day or two after birth and walking around three weeks of age.<ref name ="Schaller143">Schaller, p. 143</ref> The lioness moves her cubs to a new den site several times a month, carrying them one by one by the nape of the neck, to prevent scent from building up at a single den site and thus avoiding the attention of predators that may harm the cubs.<ref name="Scott"/>

[[Image:PregnantLioness.jpg|thumb|right|A pregnant lioness (foreground)]]
Usually, the mother does not integrate herself and her cubs back into the pride until the cubs are six to eight weeks old. <ref>Scott, Jonathon; Scott, Angela. p. 45</ref> However, sometimes this introduction to pride life occurs earlier, particularly if other lionesses have given birth at about the same time. For instance, lionesses in a pride often synchronize their reproductive cycles so that they cooperate in the raising and suckling of the young (once the cubs are past the initial stage of isolation with their mother), who suckle indiscriminately from any or all of the nursing females in the pride. In addition to greater protection, the synchronization of births also has an advantage in that the cubs end up being roughly the same size, and thus have an equal chance of survival. If one lioness gives birth to a litter of cubs a couple of months after another lioness, for instance, then the younger cubs, being much smaller than their older brethren, are usually dominated by larger cubs at mealtimes—consequently, death by starvation is more common amongst the younger cubs.

In addition to starvation, cubs also face many other dangers, such as predation by jackals, hyenas, leopards, martial eagles and snakes. Even buffaloes, should they catch the scent of lion cubs, often stampede towards the thicket or den where they are being kept, doing their best to trample the cubs to death whilst warding off the lioness.

[[Image:Male Lion and Cub Chitwa South Africa Luca Galuzzi 2004.JPG|thumb|left|The tolerance of male lions towards the cubs varies. They are, however, generally more likely to share food with the cubs than with the lionesses]]
When first introduced to the rest of the pride, the cubs initially lack confidence when confronted with adult lions other than their mother. However, they soon begin to immerse themselves in the pride life, playing amongst themselves or attempting to initiate play with the adults. Lionesses with cubs of their own are more likely to be tolerant of another lioness's cubs than lionesses without cubs. The tolerance of the male lions towards the cubs varies—sometimes, a male will patiently let the cubs play with his tail or his mane, whereas another may snarl and bat the cubs away. <ref>Scott, Jonathon; Scott, Angela; p. 46</ref>

Weaning occurs after six to seven months. Male lions reach maturity at about 3 years of age and, at 4–5 years of age, are capable of challenging and displacing the adult male(s) associated with another pride. They begin to age and weaken between 10 and 15 years of age at the latest,<ref>{{cite book |last=Crandall |first=Lee S. |title=The management of wild animals in captivity |year=1964 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |oclc=557916 }}</ref> if they have not already been critically injured whilst defending the pride (once ousted from a pride by rival males, male lions rarely manage a second take-over). This leaves a short window for their own offspring to be born and mature. If they are able to procreate as soon as they take over a pride, potentially, they may have more offspring reaching maturity before they also are displaced. A lioness often will attempt to defend her cubs fiercely from a usurping male, but such actions are rarely successful. He usually kills all of the existing cubs who are less than two years old. A lioness is weaker and much lighter than a male; success is more likely when a group of three or four mothers within a pride join forces against one male.<ref name="Packpus83"/>

Contrary to popular belief, it is not only males that are ousted from their pride to become nomads, although the majority of females certainly do remain with their birth pride. However, when the pride becomes too large, the next generation of female cubs may be forced to leave to eke out their own territory. Furthermore, when a new male lion takes over the pride, subadult lions, both male and female, may be evicted. <ref>Scott, Jonathon; Scott, Angela. p. 68''</ref> Life is harsh for a female nomad. Nomadic lionesses rarely manage to raise their cubs to maturity, without the protection of other pride members. 

One scientific study reports that both males and females may interact [[animal sexual behaviour|homosexually]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Bagemihl |first=Bruce |year=1999 |title=Biological Exuberance: Animal Homosexuality and Natural Diversity |location=New York |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=0-312-19239-8| pages=pp. 302–305}}</ref><ref>

A study found that about 8 percent of mountings have been observed to occur with other males. Female pairings are held to be fairly common in captivity, but have not been observed in the wild.

===Health===
Though adult lions have no natural predators, evidence suggests that the majority die violently from humans or other lions.<ref name ="Schaller183">Schaller, p. 183</ref> This is particularly true of male lions, who, as the main defenders of the pride, are more likely to come into aggressive contact with rival males. In fact, even though a male lion may reach an age of 15 or 16 years if he manages to avoid being ousted by other males, the majority of adult males do not live to be more than 10 years old. This is why the average lifespan of a male lion tends to be significantly less than that of a lioness in the wild. However, members of both sexes can be injured or even killed by other lions when two prides with overlapping territories come into conflict.

===Communication===
[[Image:Lion cub with mother.jpg|thumb|right|Head rubbing and licking are common social behaviors within a pride.]]
When resting, lion socialization occurs through a number of behaviors, and the animal's expressive movements are highly developed. The most common peaceful tactile gestures are head rubbing and social licking,<ref name ="Schaller85">Schaller, p. 85</ref> which have been compared with grooming in primates.<ref>{{cite book |editor=Desmond Morris|last=Sparks |first=J |title=Primate Ethology |chapter=Allogrooming in primates:a review |year=1967 |publisher=Aldine |location=Chicago |isbn=0-297-74828-9}} (2007 edition: 0-202-30826-X)</ref> Head rubbing—nuzzling one's forehead, face and neck against another lion—appears to be a form of greeting,<ref>{{de icon}}{{cite book |last=Leyhausen |first=Paul |title=Verhaltensstudien an Katzen|edition= 2nd ed. |year=1960 |publisher=Paul Parey |location=Berlin |isbn=3-489-71836-4 }}</ref> as it is seen often after an animal has been apart from others, or after a fight or confrontation. Males tend to rub other males, while cubs and females rub females.<ref name ="Schaller858">Schaller, p. 85–88</ref> Social licking often occurs in tandem with head rubbing; it is generally mutual and the recipient appears to express pleasure. The head and neck are the most common parts of the body licked, which may have arisen out of utility, as a lion cannot lick these areas individually.<ref name ="Schaller8891">Schaller, p. 88–91</ref>

Lions have an array of facial expressions and body postures that serve as visual gestures.<ref name ="Schaller92102">Schaller, p. 92–102</ref> Their repertoire of vocalizations is also large; variations in intensity and pitch, rather than discrete signals, appear central to communication. Lion sounds include snarling, purring, hissing, coughing, miaowing, woofing and roaring. Lions tend to [[Roar (animal)|roar]] in a very characteristic manner, starting with a few deep, long roars that trail off into a series of shorter ones. They most often roar at night; the sound, which can be heard from a distance of {{convert|8|km}}, is used to advertise the animal's presence.<ref name ="Schaller10313">Schaller, p. 103–113</ref> Lions have the loudest roar of any big cat.

===Interspecific predatory relationships===
The relationship between lions and [[spotted hyena]]s in areas where they coexist is unique in its complexity and intensity. Lions and spotted hyenas are both [[apex predator]]s which feed on the same prey, and are therefore in direct competition with one another. As such, they will often fight over and steal each others' kills. Though hyenas are popularly assumed to be opportunistic scavengers profiting from the lion's hunting abilities, it is quite often the case that the reverse is true. In Tanzania's Ngorongoro Crater, the spotted hyena population greatly exceeds that of the resident lions, which obtain a large proportion of their food by stealing hyena prey. The feud between the two species however encompasses more than just battles over food. In animals, it is usually the case that territorial boundaries of another species are disregarded. Hyenas and lions are an exception to this; they set boundaries against each other as they would against members of their own species. Male lions in particular are extremely aggressive toward hyenas, and have been observed to hunt and kill hyenas without eating them. Conversely, hyenas are major predators of lion cubs, and will harass lionesses over kills.<ref>[http://www.wildwatch.com/living_library/mammals-2/spotted-hyena Living Library | Spotted Hyena | Article in Mammals<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.lioncrusher.com/animal.asp?animal=75 Lioncrusher's Domain - Spotted Hyena (Crocuta crocuta) facts and pictures<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, healthy adult males, even single ones, are generally avoided at all costs.

Lions tend to dominate smaller felines such as [[cheetah]]s and [[leopard]]s in areas where they are sympatric. They will steal their kills and will kill their cubs and even adults when given the chance. The cheetah has a 50 percent chance of losing its kill to lions or other predators.<ref>O'Brien, S., D. Wildt, M. Bush (1986). "The Cheetah in Genetic Peril". Scientific American 254: 68–76.</ref> Lions are major killers of cheetah cubs, up to 90 percent of which are lost in their first weeks of life due to attacks by other predators. Cheetahs avoid competition by hunting at different times of the day and hide their cubs in thick brush. Leopards also use such tactics, but have the advantage of being able to subsist much better on small prey than either lions or cheetahs. Also, unlike cheetahs, leopards can climb trees and use them to keep their cubs and kills away from lions. However, lionesses will occasionally be successful in climbing to retrieve leopard kills.<ref name ="Schaller293">Schaller, p. 293</ref> Similarly, lions dominate [[African Wild Dog|African wild dogs]], not only taking their kills but also preying on both young and adult dogs (although the latter are rarely caught).<ref>[http://www.animalinfo.org/species/carnivor/lycapict.htm Animal Info - African Wild Dog<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The [[Nile crocodile]] is the only large predator (besides man) that can singly threaten the lion. Depending on the size of the crocodile and the lion, either can lose kills or carrion to the other. Lions have been known to kill crocodiles venturing onto land,<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/2509crocs.html Crocodiles! - PBS Nova transcript<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> while the reverse is true for lions entering waterways containing crocodiles, as evidenced by the fact that lion claws have on occasion been found in crocodile stomachs.<ref name="Guggisberg">{{cite book | author = Guggisberg, C.A.W. |url =  | title = Crocodiles: Their Natural History, Folklore, and Conservation| year = 1972 | pages = pp.195 | id = ISBN 0715352725}}</ref>

Until the late [[Pleistocene]] (about 10,000 years ago), the lion was the most widespread land mammal aside from man. They were found in most of Africa, much of Eurasia from western Europe to India and the [[Beringia|Bering land bridge]], and in the Americas from [[Yukon]] to Peru. Parts of this range were occupied by subspecies that are extinct today.

==Population and conservation status==

The lion population in the region of West Africa is isolated from lion populations of Central Africa, with little or no exchange of breeding individuals. The number of mature individuals in West Africa is estimated by two separate recent surveys at 850–1,160 (2002/2004). There is disagreement over the size of the largest individual population in West Africa: the estimates range from 100 to 400 lions in [[Burkina Faso]]'s [[Arly-Singou]] ecosystem.<ref name=IUCN/>

The former popularity of the Barbary lion as a zoo animal has meant that scattered lions in captivity are likely to be descended from Barbary Lion stock. This includes twelve lions at [[Port Lympne Zoo|Port Lympne Wild Animal Park]] in [[Kent]], [[England]] that are descended from animals owned by the [[King of Morocco]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bigcatrescue.org/barbary_lion_news.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051217091555/http://www.bigcatrescue.org/barbary_lion_news.htm |archivedate=2005-12-17 |title=Barbary Lion News |accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref> Another eleven animals believed to be Barbary lions were found in [[Addis Ababa]] zoo, descendants of animals owned by [[Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia|Emperor Haile Selassie]].

Following the discovery of the decline of lion population in Africa, several coordinated efforts involving lion [[Wildlife conservation|conservation]] have been organised in an attempt to stem this decline.
Lions are one species included in the [[Species Survival Plan]], a coordinated attempt by the [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] to increase its chances of survival. The plan was originally started in 1982 for the Asiatic lion, but was suspended when it was found that most Asiatic lions in North American zoos were not [[Genetic pollution|genetically pure]], having been hybridized with African lions. The African lion plan started in 1993, focusing especially on the South African subspecies, although there are difficulties in assessing the genetic diversity of captive lions, since most individuals are of unknown origin, making maintenance of genetic diversity a problem.<ref name="zoos_encyclopedia"/>

===Man-eaters ===
{{main|Man-eater}}
While lions do not usually hunt people, some (usually males) seem to seek out human prey; well-publicized cases include the [[Tsavo maneaters]], where 28 railway workers building the [[Uganda Railway|Kenya-Uganda Railway]] were taken by lions over nine months during the construction of a bridge over the [[Tsavo River]] in [[Kenya]] in 1898, and the 1991 [[Mfuwe]] man-eater, which killed six people in the Laungwa River Valley in [[Zambia]].<ref>{{cite web | coauthors=Wayne Hosek | title=Man-eaters of the Field Museum: Lion of Mfuwe | work=Field Museum of Natural History | publisher=Field Museum of Natural History | year=2007| url =http://www.fieldmuseum.org/exhibits/exhibit_sites/tsavo/mfuwe.html | accessdate =2007-09-16}}</ref> In both, the hunters who killed the lions wrote books detailing the animals' predatory behavior. The Mfuwe and Tsavo incidents bear similarities: the lions in both incidents were larger than normal, lacked manes, and seemed to suffer from [[dental caries|tooth decay]]. The infirmity theory, including tooth decay, is not favored by all researchers.{{Fact|date=February 2008}} An analysis of teeth and jaws of man-eating lions in museum collections suggests that, while tooth decay may explain some incidents, prey depletion in human-dominated areas is a more likely cause of lion predation on humans.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Patterson |first=Bruce D. |coauthors=Ellis J.

[[Image:Maneating lion.jpg|thumb|A man-eating lion in [[British East Africa]]]]
The lion's proclivity for man-eating has been systematically examined. American and Tanzanian scientists report that man-eating behavior in rural areas of Tanzania increased greatly from 1990 to 2005. At least 563 villagers were attacked and many eaten over this period—a number far exceeding the more famed "Tsavo" incidents of a century earlier. The incidents occurred near [[Selous Game Reserve|Selous National Park]] in [[Rufiji River|Rufiji District]] and in [[Lindi Region|Lindi Province]] near the [[Mozambique|Mozambican]] border. While the expansion of villagers into bush country is one concern, the authors argue that conservation policy must mitigate the danger because, in this case, conservation contributes directly to human deaths. Cases in Lindi have been documented where lions seize humans from the center of substantial villages.<ref name="Packer05">{{cite journal |last=Packer |first=C. |coauthors=Ikanda, D.; Kissui, B.; Kushnir, H. |year=2005 |month=August |title=Conservation biology: lion attacks on humans in Tanzania |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=436 |issue=7053 |pages=927–928 |doi=10.1038/436927a| pmid=16107828}}</ref>

Author Robert R. Frump wrote in ''The Man-eaters of Eden'' that Mozambican refugees regularly crossing Kruger National Park at night in [[South Africa]] are attacked and eaten by the lions; park officials have conceded that man-eating is a problem there. Frump believes thousands may have been killed in the decades after [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid]] sealed the park and forced the refugees to cross the park at night. For nearly a century before the border was sealed, Mozambicans had regularly walked across the park in daytime with little harm.<ref>{{cite book |last=Frump |first=RR |title=The Man-Eaters of Eden: Life and Death in Kruger National Park |year=2006 |publisher=The Lyons Press |location= |isbn=1-592288-92-9}}</ref>

Packer estimates more than 200 Tanzanians are killed each year by lions, [[crocodile]]s, elephants, hippos, and [[snake]]s, and that the numbers could be double that amount, with lions thought to kill at least 70 of those.

A man-eating lion was killed by game scouts in Southern Tanzania in April 2004.

[[Image:Durer lions (sketch).jpg|thumb|[[Albrecht Dürer]], Lions sketch. Circa 1520.]]
Seraglios served as expressions of the nobility's power and wealth. Animals such as big cats and [[elephant]]s, in particular, symbolized power, and would be pitted in fights against each other or domesticated animals. By extension, menageries and seraglios served as demonstrations of the dominance of man over nature. Consequently, the defeat of such natural "lords" by a cow in 1682 astonished the spectators, and the flight of an elephant before a rhinoceros drew jeers. Such fights would slowly fade out in the seventeenth century with the spread of the menagerie and their appropriation by the commoners. The tradition of keeping big cats as pets would last into the nineteenth century, at which time it was seen as highly eccentric.<ref>Baratay & Hardouin-Fugier, pp. 24–28.</ref>

The presence of lions at the Tower of London was intermittent, being restocked when a monarch or his consort, such as [[Margaret of Anjou]] the wife of [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], either sought or were given animals.

The wild animals trade flourished alongside improved colonial trade of the nineteenth century. Lions were considered fairly common and inexpensive. Although they would barter higher than tigers, they were less costly than larger, or more difficult to transport animals such as the giraffe and hippopotamus, and much less than [[Giant Panda|panda]]s.<ref>Baratay & Hardouin-Fugier, p. 122.</ref> Like other animals, lions were seen as little more than a natural, boundless commodity that was mercilessly exploited with terrible losses in capture and transportation.<ref>Baratay & Hardouin-Fugier, pp. 114, 117.</ref> The widely reproduced imagery of the heroic hunter chasing lions would dominate a large part of the century.<ref>Baratay & Hardouin-Fugier, p. 113.</ref> Explorers and hunters exploited a popular [[Manichaeism|Manichean]] division of animals into "good" and "evil" to add thrilling value to their adventures, casting themselves as heroic figures.

Lions were kept in cramped and squalid conditions at London Zoo until a larger lion house with roomier cages was built in the 1870s.<ref name ="Blunt208">Blunt, p. 208</ref> Further changes took place in the early twentieth century, when [[Carl Hagenbeck]] designed enclosures more closely resembling a natural habitat, with concrete 'rocks', more open space and a moat instead of bars. He designed lion enclosures for both [[Melbourne Zoo]] and Sydney's [[Taronga Zoo]], among others, in the early twentieth century. Though his designs were popular, the old bars and cage enclosures prevailed until the 1960s in many zoos.<ref name ="dc69">de Courcy, p. 69</ref> In the later decades of the twentieth century, larger, more natural enclosures and the use of [[mesh|wire mesh]] or [[laminated glass]] instead of lowered dens allowed visitors to come closer than ever to the animals, with some attractions even placing the den on ground higher than visitors, such as the Cat Forest/Lion Overlook of [[Oklahoma City Zoo and Botanical Garden|Oklahoma City Zoological Park]].<ref name="zoos_encyclopedia"/> Lions are now housed in much larger naturalistic areas; modern recommended guidelines more closely approximate conditions in the wild with closer attention to the lions' needs, highlighting the need for dens in separate areas, elevated positions in both sun and shade where lions can sit and adequate ground cover and drainage as well as sufficient space to roam.<ref name ="WAZA"/>

There have also been instances where a lion was kept by a private individual, such as the lioness [[Elsa the Lioness|Elsa]], who was raised by [[George Adamson]] and his wife [[Joy Adamson]] and came to develop a strong bonds with them, particularly the latter. The lioness later achieved fame, her life being documented in a series of books and films.

===Baiting and taming===

[[Image:Circus Lion Tamer.jpg|right|thumb|Nineteenth century [[etching]] of a lion tamer in a cage of lions]]
Lion-baiting is a [[blood sport]] involving the [[animal-baiting|baiting]] of lions in combat with other animals, usually dogs. Records of it exist in ancient times through until the seventeenth century. It was finally banned in [[Vienna]] by 1800 and England in 1825.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hone |first= William |editor= Kyle Grimes|title= The Every-Day Book |origyear=1825–1826 |url=http://www.uab.edu/english/hone/etexts/edb/day-pages/207-july26.html |accessdate=2007-09-05 |year=2004 |publisher=University of Alabama at Birmingham |pages=26 |chapter=July |chapterurl=http://www.uab.edu/english/hone/etexts/edb/indices/index.html#jul}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Blaisdell |first=Warren H. |year=1997 |month=November |title= How A Lion Fight Caused England To Stop The Breeding Of Both Ring And Pit Bulldogs|journal=American Bulldog Review |volume=3 |issue=4 |url=http://www.american-bulldog.com/how_a_lion.htm |accessdate= 2007-09-05}}</ref>

Lion taming refers to the practice of taming lions for entertainment, either as part of an established [[circus]] or as an individual act, such as [[Siegfried & Roy]]. The term is also often used for the taming and display of other big cats such as [[tiger]]s, [[leopard]]s, and [[cougar]]s. The practice was pioneered in the first half of the nineteenth century by Frenchman Henri Martin and American Isaac Van Amburgh who both toured widely, and whose techniques were copied by a number of followers.<ref name = "baratay187"/> Van Amburgh performed before Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom]] in 1838 when he toured [[Great Britain]]. Martin composed a [[pantomime]] titled ''Les Lions de Mysore'' ("the lions of Mysore"), an idea that Amburgh quickly borrowed. These acts eclipsed [[equestrianism]] acts as the central display of circus shows, but truly entered public consciousness in the early twentieth century with cinema. In demonstrating the superiority of man over animal, lion taming served a purpose similar to animal fights of previous centuries.<ref name="baratay187">Baratay & Hardouin-Fugier, p. 187.</ref> The now iconic lion tamer's chair was possibly first used by American [[Clyde Beatty]] (1903–1965).<ref>{{cite book | first=David | last=Feldman | authorlink=David Feldman (author) | coauthors= | year=1993 | title=How Does Aspirin Find a Headache? | edition= | publisher=HarperCollins | location= | isbn= 0-06-016923-0 }}</ref>

The lion has been an icon for humanity for thousands of years, appearing in cultures across Europe, Asia, and Africa. Despite incidents of attacks on humans, lions have enjoyed a positive depiction in culture as strong but noble. A common depiction is their representation as "[[Monarchy|king]] of the jungle" or "king of the beasts"; hence, the lion has been a popular symbol of royalty and stateliness,<ref name ="Garai73">{{cite book |last=Garai |first=Jana |title=The Book of Symbols |year=1973 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |isbn=671-21773-9}}</ref> as well as a symbol of bravery; it is featured in several [[Aesop's Fables|fables]] of the

Representations of lions date back 32,000&nbsp;years; the [[Lion man|lion-headed]] ivory carving from Vogelherd cave in the [[Swabian Alb]] in southwestern [[Germany]] has been determined to be about 32,000&nbsp;years old from the [[Aurignacian]] culture.<ref name="BurgerJ-Molecular-phylogeny"/> Two lions were depicted mating in the Chamber of Felines in 15,000-year-old [[Paleolithic]] [[cave painting]]s in the [[Lascaux]] caves. Cave lions are also depicted in the [[Chauvet Cave]], discovered in 1994; this has been dated at 32,000&nbsp;years of age,<ref name="Packer00"/> though it may be of similar or younger age to Lascaux.<ref>{{cite conference| first=Christian | last=Züchner | title=Grotte Chauvet Archaeologically Dated | date=September 1998 | location=International Rock Art Congress IRAC ´98 - Vila Real – Portugal | url=http://www.uf.uni-erlangen.de/chauvet/chauvet.html | accessdate =2007-08-27}}</ref>

Careful examination of the lion deities noted in many ancient cultures reveal that many are lioness also. Admiration for the co-operative hunting strategies of lionesses was evident in very ancient times. Most of the ''lion gates'' depict lionesses. The [[Nemean lion]] was symbolic in Ancient Greece and Rome, represented as the constellation and zodiac sign [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]], and described in mythology, where its skin was borne by the hero [[Heracles]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Graves |first=R |authorlink=Robert Graves |title=Greek Myths |year=1955|publisher=Penguin |location=London |isbn=0-14-001026-2|pages=465–469 |chapter=The First Labour:The Nemean Lion}}</ref>

[[Image:Jerusalem-coat-of-arms.svg|thumb|upright|left|The emblem of [[Jerusalem]] is a lion standing in front of the [[Western Wall]] and flanked by [[olive branch]]es.]] 
The lion is the biblical emblem of the [[tribe of Judah]] and later the [[Kingdom of Judah]]. It is contained within Jacob's blessing to his fourth son in the penultimate chapter of the [[Book of Genesis]], "Judah is a lion's whelp; On prey, my son have you grown. He crouches, lies down like a lion, like the king of beasts—who dare rouse him?" (Genesis 49:9<ref>[[New Jewish Publication Society of America Version|JPS Tanakh]]</ref>). In the modern state of [[Israel]], the lion remains the symbol of the capital city of [[Jerusalem]], emblazoned on both the [[Flag of Jerusalem|flag]] and [[Coat of arms of Jerusalem|coat of arms]] of the city. 

The lion was a prominent symbol in both the [[Old Babylonian]] and [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] periods. The classic Babylonian lion motif, found as a statue, carved or painted on walls, is often referred to as the ''striding lion of Babylon''. It is in Babylon that the biblical [[Daniel]] is said to have been delivered from the lion's den.<ref>[[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 6</ref> Such symbolism was appropriated by Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq for their [[Lion of Babylon tank]], with the technology adapted from a Russian model.

In the [[Puranic]] texts of [[Hinduism]], [[Narasimha]] ("man-lion") a half-lion, half-man incarnation or ([[avatara]]) of [[Vishnu]], is worshipped by his devotees and saved the child devotee [[Prahlada]] from his father, the evil demon king [[Hiranyakashipu]];<ref> [http://srimadbhagavatam.com/1/3/18/en1 Bhag-P 1.3.18] "In the fourteenth incarnation, the Lord appeared as Nrisimha and bifurcated the strong body of the atheist Hiranyakasipu with His nails, just as a carpenter pierces cane." </ref> Vishnu takes the form of half-man/half-[[Asiatic Lions|lion]], in Narasimha, having a human torso and lower body, but with a lion-like face and claws.<ref> [http://srimadbhagavatam.com/7/8/19-22/en1 Bhag-P 7.8.19–22] </ref> Narasimha is worshiped as "Lion God."

[[Singh]] is an [[ancient]] [[India]]n [[Vedic Sanskrit|vedic]] name meaning "lion" ([[Asiatic lion]]), dating back over 2000 years to [[ancient India]]. It was originally only used by [[Rajputs]] a [[Hindu]] [[Kshatriya]] or military [[caste]] in India. After the birth of the [[Khalsa]] brotherhood in 1699, the [[Sikh]]s also adopted the name "Singh" due to the wishes of [[Guru Gobind Singh]].

The Asiatic lion is a common motif in [[Chinese art]]. They were first used in art during the late [[Spring and Autumn Period]] (fifth or sixth century BC), and became much more popular during the [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BC – AD 220), when [[imperial guardian lions]] started to be placed in front of imperial palaces for protection. Because lions have never been native to China, early depictions were somewhat unrealistic; after the introduction of [[Buddhist art]] to China in the [[Tang Dynasty]] (after the sixth century AD), lions were usually depicted without wings, their bodies became thicker and shorter, and their manes became curly.<ref>Li Ling (May 2002).
