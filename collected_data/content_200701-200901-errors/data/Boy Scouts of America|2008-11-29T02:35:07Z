The '''Boy Scouts of America''' ('''BSA''') is the largest [[List of youth organizations|youth organization]] in the United States, with over five million members in its age-related divisions.  Since its founding in 1910 as part of the international [[Scouting|Scout Movement]], more than 110&nbsp;million Americans have been members of the BSA.<ref name="honor">{{cite book |last=Townley |first=Alvin |authorlink=Alvin Townley |url=http://www.legacyofhonor.com/ |title=Legacy of Honor: The Values and Influence of America's Eagle Scouts |publisher=St. Martin's Press |location=New York |year=2007 |isbn=0-312-36653-1 |accessdate=2008-06-22 |page=12}}</ref>

The BSA seeks to train youth in responsible citizenship, character development, and self-reliance through participation in a wide range of outdoor activities, educational programs, and, at older age levels, career-oriented programs in partnership with community organizations. For younger members, the [[Scout method]] is used to inculcate typical Scouting values such as honesty, good citizenship, and outdoors skills, through a variety of activities such as camping, aquatics, and hiking.<ref name="vision">{{cite web |url=http://www.usscouts.org/usscouts/aboutbsa/vision.asp |title=BSA Vision Statement |work=[[U.S. Scouting Service Project]] |accessdate=2008-07-22}}</ref><ref name="aims">{{cite web |url=http://clipart.usscouts.org/ScoutDoc/BSA_Aims/aims.pdf |format=PDF|title=Aims of the Boy Scouts of America |work=U.S. Scouting Service Project |accessdate=2008-07-03}}</ref>

The BSA is a constituent member of the [[World Organization of the Scout Movement]]. The traditional Scouting divisions are ''Cub Scouting'' for boys ages 7–10, ''Boy Scouting'' for boys ages 10–17 and ''Venturing'' for young men and women ages 14–21. [[Learning for Life]] is a non-traditional subsidiary that provides in-school and career education.<ref name="members"/><ref name="grolier">{{cite web |url=http://nbk.grolier.com/cgi-bin/article?assetid=a2003470-h |title=Boy Scouts |work=The New Book of Knowledge |publisher=Grolier Online |accessdate=2008-02-24}} (registration required)</ref> The BSA operates traditional Scouting locally through units sponsored and operated by churches, clubs, civic associations, educational organizations and the like. Units are led entirely by volunteers who are supported by local councils using both paid professionals and volunteers.

The influence of Scouting on American society is frequently cited by both its advocates and critics. In addition to nostalgic memories of campfires kindling friendships, prominent leaders in various fields of endeavor have credited the skills they learned in Scouting as helping mold them into successful citizens. Critics have called the BSA's membership restrictions pertaining to avowed atheists and homosexuals unfair, resulting in litigation in various state and federal courts.

==Origins==
{{see|Scouting|Scouting in the United States|History of the Boy Scouts of America}}
The [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive movement]] in the United States was at its height during the early twentieth century.<ref>{{cite paper |last=Phillips|first=John Calvin |title=Selling America: the Boy Scouts of America in the Progressive Era, 1910-1921 |publisher=University of Maine |year=2001 |url=http://www.library.umaine.edu/theses/pdf/PhillipsJC2001.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=2008-07-19}}</ref> With the migration of families from farms to cities, there were concerns among some people that young men were no longer learning patriotism and individualism.  The [[YMCA]] was an early promoter of reforms for young men with a focus on [[Social welfare provision|social welfare]] and programs of mental, physical, social and religious development.<ref name="macleod">{{cite book |last=Macleod |first=David L. |title=Building Character in the American Boy: The Boy Scouts, YMCA and Their Forerunners, 1870–1920 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |year=1983 |isbn=0-299-09400-6 }}</ref>{{rp|72–82}}

Scouting had two notable predecessors in the United States: the [[Woodcraft Indians]] started by [[Ernest Thompson Seton]] in 1902 and the [[Sons of Daniel Boone]] founded by [[Daniel Carter Beard]] in 1905.<ref>{{cite book |last=Anderson |first=H.

In 1909, Chicago publisher [[William D. Boyce|W. D. Boyce]] was visiting London, where he encountered the [[Unknown Scout]] and learned of the Scouting movement.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Peterson |first=Robert W. |authorlink=Robert W.

Hanmer]] became interested in the nascent BSA movement and convinced Boyce to turn the program over to the YMCA for development in April 1910.  Robinson enlisted Seton, Beard and other prominent leaders in the early youth movements. In January 1911, Robinson turned the movement over to [[James E. West (Scouting)|James E. West]] who became the first [[Chief Scout Executive]] and Scouting began to expand in the U.S.<ref name="macleod"/>{{rp|148}}

The BSA's stated purpose at its incorporation in 1910 was "to teach [boys] patriotism, courage, self-reliance, and kindred values".<ref name="honor"/>{{rp|7}} Later, in 1937, Deputy Chief Scout Executive [[George J. Fisher]] expressed the BSA's mission; "Each generation as it comes to maturity has no more important duty than that of teaching high ideals and proper behavior to the generation which follows".<ref name=Jambo37>{{cite book |title=The National and World Jamborees in Pictures |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |location=New York |year=1937 |page=p. 131}}</ref> The current mission statement of the BSA is "to prepare young people to make ethical and moral choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and Law."<ref name="vision"/>

==Membership==
===Traditional membership===
[[Image:VarsityScoutspreparingtoheadoutbackpacking2004.jpg|right|thumb|[[Varsity Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Varsity Scouts]] preparing to go [[Backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]]]]
In the BSA, Scouting is considered to be one movement with three main programs:

'''[[Cub Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Cub Scouting]]''' is the largest of the three programs, available to boys from first–grade through fifth–grade or seven through ten years old. The program is designed to pursue the aims of character development, citizenship training, and personal fitness. Cub Scouting is divided into age-based levels of Tiger Cubs, Wolf Cubs, Bear Cubs, and Webelos Scouts.<ref name="vision"/> <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usscouts.org/advance/cubscout/intro.asp |title=Cub Scout Advancement |work=U.S. Scouting Service Project |accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref>

'''[[Boy Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Boy Scouting]]''' is the [[wikt:flagship|flagship]] program of the BSA for boys ages 10 to 18. It uses outdoor activities such as camping, aquatics and hiking to achieve the aims of character, citizenship and personal fitness training.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scouting.org/Media/FactSheets/02-503.aspx |title=What is Boy Scouting?|work=Fact Sheet |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=2008-07-03}}</ref> '''[[Varsity Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Varsity Scouting]]''' is a sub-division of Boy Scouting available to boys from 14 to 17; it adds a program of [[high adventure]] and sporting activities.<ref name="Varsity Program">{{cite web |url=http://usscouts.org/advance/boyscout/varsity.asp |title=Varsity Letters and Pins |date=2007-08-05 |publisher=U.S. Scouting Service Project |accessdate=2008-07-03}}</ref> '''[[Order of the Arrow]]''' is the Boy Scouting national honor society for experienced campers, based on [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]]<!--- American Indian is the preferred usage by the BSA.

'''[[Venturing (Boy Scouts of America)|Venturing]]''' is the program for young men and women ages 14 through 21.<ref name="28-406">{{cite book|url=http://www.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/28-406.pdf |format=PDF|title=Boy Scouts of America Youth Application |id=#28-406B |accessdate=2008-03-10 |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |quote=Venturers and Sea Scouts registered in a crew or ship prior to their 21st birthday may continue as members after their 21st birthday until the crew or ship recharters or until they reach their 22nd birthday, whichever comes first.}}</ref> Its purpose is to provide positive experiences to help youth mature and to prepare them to become responsible adults.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scouting.org/Media/FactSheets/02-388.aspx |title=What is Venturing |work=Fact Sheet |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=2008-06-24}}</ref> '''[[Sea Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Sea Scouting]]''' is one of five focus areas in Venturing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://seascout.org/|title=Sea Scouts, BSA|work=Sea Scouts, BSA|accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref>

There are about 100,000 physically or mentally disabled Scouts throughout the United States. Anyone certified as disabled "may enroll in Scouting and remain in its program beyond the regulation age limits. This provision allows all members to advance in Scouting as far as they wish."<ref name="grolier"/> Advancement is measured by the achievement to the best of the Scout's abilities.

===Membership controversies===
{{details|Boy Scouts of America membership controversies}}

Protests over the inclusion of [[African American]]s arose early in the program.  When [[W.D. Boyce]] departed the organization, he turned the Boy Scout corporation over to the members of the Executive Board with the stipulation that the Boy Scouts would not discriminate on the basis of race or creed.  The BSA established the position that African Americans should be included, but that local communities should follow the same policies that they followed in the school systems.  Thus, much of the American south as well as many major northern communities had segregated programs with "colored troops" until the late 1940s.

The BSA has policies which prohibit [[atheism|atheists]], [[agnosticism|agnostics]], and "known or avowed" [[Homosexuality|homosexuals]] from membership in its Scouting program; both youths and adults have had their memberships revoked as a result. The BSA contends that these policies are essential in its mission to instill in young people the [[values]] of the Scout Oath and Law.<ref name="core">{{cite web |url=http://www.bsalegal.org/core-values-286.asp |work=BSALegal.org |title=Core Values |accessdate=2006-10-02}}</ref><ref name="duty">{{cite web |url=http://www.bsalegal.org/duty-to-god-cases-224.asp |work=BSALegal.org |title=Duty to God |accessdate=2008-05-25}}</ref> The BSA also prohibits girls from participating in Cub Scouting and Boy Scouting. These policies are controversial and are considered by some to be unfair.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsa-discrimination.org |work=BSA Discrimination |title=Discrimination in the BSA |accessdate=2006-09-04}}</ref>

The organization's legal right to have these policies has been upheld repeatedly by both state and federal courts. The Supreme Court has affirmed that as a private organization, the BSA can set its own membership standards. In recent years, the policy disputes have led to litigation over the terms under which the BSA can access governmental resources, including public lands, and its non-sectarian status.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Sherman |first=Mark |publisher=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2006/10/16/state/n075532D70.DTL |title=Supreme Court Won't Review Berkeley Sea Scouts' Case|accessdate=2008-05-25}}</ref>

===Learning for Life===
[[Learning for Life]] is a school and work-site based program that is a subsidiary of the BSA. It utilizes programs designed for schools and community-based organizations that are designed to prepare youth to for the complexities of contemporary society and to enhance their self-confidence, motivation, and self-esteem.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.learning-for-life.org/ |title=Learning for Life&nbsp;— Exploring |publisher=Learning For Life |accessdate=2008-06-24}}</ref> [[Exploring (Learning for Life)|Exploring]] is the worksite-based program of Learning for Life with programs based on five areas of emphasis: career opportunities, life skills, citizenship, character education, and leadership experience.<ref name="lfl outside">{{cite web |url=http://www.bsa-discrimination.org/html/lfl.html |title=Learning For Life |publisher=BSA Discrimination |accessdate=2008-06-24}}</ref>

Learning for Life is not considered a traditional [[Scouting]] program; it does not use the [[Scout Promise]], [[Scout Law]], uniforms, or insignia of traditional Scouting. All Learning for Life programs are open to youth and adults without restriction based on gender, residence, sexual orientation, or other considerations other than age requirements.<ref name="lfl outside"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.learning-for-life.org/exploring/promos/99-993.pdf |format=PDF|title=What Is Exploring? |publisher=Learning For Life |accessdate=2008-06-24}}</ref>

==Aims, methods, and ideals==
The stated objectives of the BSA are referred to as ''Aims of Scouting'': character development, citizenship training, and personal fitness. The BSA pursues these aims through an informal education system called the [[Scout method]], with variations that are designed to be appropriate for the age and maturity of each membership division.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://usscouts.org/usscouts/aboutbsa/vision.asp |title=BSA Vision Statement |work=U.S. Scouting Service Project |accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref><ref name="ldrtrng">{{cite web |url=http://www.scouting.org/BoyScouts/NewLeaderTraining/basic.aspx |title=Basic Leader Training |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=2008-03-04}}</ref>

One of the more visible methods of Cub Scouting is the [[Uniform and insignia of the Boy Scouts of America#Cub Scout uniform|uniform]] that gives each boy a level of identity within the den, the pack and the community. The boys learn teamwork by meeting and working together in a den of eight to ten boys under adult leadership.  They learn and apply the ideals codified in the [[Cub Scout Promise]] and the [[Law of the Pack]], <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usscouts.org/advance/cubscout/cspromiselaw.asp |title=The Cub Scout Promise The Law of the Pack and The Cub Scout Motto |date=2007-08-05 |work=U.S. Scouting Service Project |accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref> and in the Character Connections program that develops the core values of citizenship, compassion, cooperation, courage, faith, health and fitness, honesty, perseverance, positive attitude, resourcefulness, respect and responsibility.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usscouts.org/usscouts/advance/cubscout/CharacterConnections.asp |title=Character Connections |date=2007-08-05 |work=U.S. Scouting Service Project |accessdate=2008-07-14}}</ref>  The advancement system uses both age-based ranks and an optional Academics and Sports Program designed for the development of physical, mental and emotional fitness.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usscouts.org/usscouts/advance/cubscout/intro.asp |title=Cub Scout Advancement |date=2007-11-10 |work=U.S. Scouting Service Project |accessdate=2008-07-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usscouts.org/usscouts/advance/cubscout/a-sindex.asp |title=Cub Scout Academics and Sports Program |date=2007-11-10 |work=U.S. Scouting Service Project |accessdate=2008-07-14}}</ref> Most advancement is done in the home and is intended to involve the entire family and many Cub Scout activities include family members.  Cub Scout packs are sponsored by a community organization as part of their youth program and is involved in the neighborhood and community.

Boy Scouts learn to use the ideals spelled out in the [[Scout Oath]], the [[Scout Law]], the Scout motto, and the Scout slogan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usscouts.org/advance/boyscout/bsoathlaw.asp |title=Boy Scout Oath, Law, Motto and Slogan and the Outdoor Code |date=2007-08-05 |work=U.S. Scouting Service Project |accessdate=2008-07-14}}</ref> They wear a [[Uniform and insignia of the Boy Scouts of America#Boy Scout and Varsity Scout uniform|uniform]] and work together in patrols of eight to ten boys with an elected patrol leader. Scouts share responsibilities, apply skills learned at meetings and live together in the outdoors.  The advancement system provides opportunities for personal growth and self-reliance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usscouts.org/usscouts/advance/boyscout/intro.asp|title=Boy Scout Advancement|date=2008-01-17|work=U.S. Scouting Service Project|accessdate=2008-07-14}}</ref> Scouts interact with adult leaders who act as role models and mentors, but they are expected to plan their own activities within the troop and to participate in community service. Opportunities are provided for leadership training with practical application.

Venturers are expected to know and live by the [[Venturing Oath]] and [[Venturing Code]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usscouts.org/usscouts/venturing/WordDocs/WhatIsVenturingFact.doc |format=doc |title=What is Venturing|work=U.S. Scouting Service Project|accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref>  They associate and work directly with adults as partners, but the crew is led by elected youth officers who are given opportunities to learn and apply leadership skills.  Venturers plan and participate in interdependent group experiences dependent on cooperation. An emphasis on high adventure provides opportunities for team-building and practical leadership applications. A series of awards provide opportunities for recognition and personal growth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usscouts.org/usscouts/advance/venturing/intro.asp |title=Venturing and Sea Scouting Awards |date=2007-08-09| work=U.S. Scouting Service Project |accessdate=2008-07-14}}</ref>  Each award requires the Venturer to teach what they have learned to others returning the skill and knowledge back to the community and enabling the Venturer to master those skills.

==Organization==
===National Council===
[[Image:BlackwaterRiverCanoe5.jpg|thumb|Boy Scouts canoeing on the [[Blackwater River (Virginia)|Blackwater River, Virginia]]]]
The National Council is the corporate membership of the Boy Scouts of America and is administered by paid professional Scouters and volunteer Scouters. Members include the elected National Executive Board, the regional executive committees, the local council representatives, members at large, and honorary members. The National program is directed by the National Executive Board and administered by the [[Chief Scout Executive]] using a staff of professional Scouters.

The BSA was granted a [[Congressional charter]] in 1916, now codified as 36 U.S.C. Chapter 309,<ref name="fedcharter">{{usctc|36|309|}} Federal charter, Boy Scouts of America</ref> stating that their purpose is to:
<blockquote>promote, through organization, and cooperation with other agencies, the ability of boys to do things for themselves and others, to train them in scoutcraft, and to teach them patriotism, courage, self-reliance, and kindred virtues, using the methods that were in common use by boy scouts on June&nbsp;15, 1916.</blockquote>

The charter authorized and set standards for the incorporation of the Boy Scouts of America. A provision in the federal charter gives the BSA the "exclusive right to use emblems, badges, descriptive or designating marks, and words or phrases" that they adopt.

The BSA is governed by the National Executive Board and directed by the [[national president of the Boy Scouts of America|national president]], elected by representatives from the local councils.<ref name="bsaorg">{{cite web |last=Nelson |first=Bill |url=http://usscouts.org/aboutbsa/bsaorg.asp| title=Organization of the Boy Scouts of America |work=U.S. Scouting Service Project |accessdate=2008-03-12}}</ref> Board memberships include regular elected members, presidents, the Advisory Council chair, and the chairman of the Board of Regents of the [[National Eagle Scout Association]]. The board may also include up to five appointed youth members. Professional Scouters of the National staff are nonvoting members.

The National Executive Board has five group standing committees: the Administration Group Committee, Program Group Committee, Human Resources Group Committee, Regional Presidents' Group Committee, and Relationships/Marketing Group Committee.<ref name="r&r">{{cite book |title=Rules and Regulations of the Boy Scouts of America |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |year=1985}}</ref> Each of these committees is in turn directly responsible for a corresponding support group that provides administrative functions. Group committees may in turn be responsible for support standing committees and groups divided into divisions.

===Groups and divisions===
The Program Group is responsible for delivering the Scouting program and includes the Boy Scouting, Cub Scouting, and Venturing Divisions. The [[Scoutreach|Scoutreach Division]] emphasizes service to rural and urban areas and to minority populations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scoutreachbsa.org/ |title=Scoutreach Division— BSA |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=2008-06-24}}</ref> The African American Focus works with African American populations in partnerships with the NAACP, various the African American churches and other groups.

===Regions and areas===
[[Image:BSA Region Map.svg|thumb|Boy Scouts of America regions as of 1992]]
For administrative purposes, the BSA is divided into four regions—Western, Central, [[Southern Region (Boy Scouts of America)|Southern]], and Northeast.<ref name="bsaorg"/> Each region is then subdivided into areas.

Each region has a volunteer president, assisted by volunteer officers and board members, and the day-to-day work of Scouting is managed by the regional director, assistant and associate regional directors, and area directors. Regions and areas are subdivisions of the National Council and do not have a corporate status separate from the BSA.<ref name="r&r"/>
*Central Region covers all of Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota, Ohio, Wisconsin, and parts of Indiana, Kentucky, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Virginia, and West Virginia.
*Northeast Region covers all of Connecticut, District of Columbia, Delaware, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Puerto Rico, Transatlantic Council, and the Virgin Islands, and parts of Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nerbsa.org/ |title=Northeast Region |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref>

===Local councils===
{{maincat|Local councils of the Boy Scouts of America}}
The BSA program is administered through 308&nbsp;local councils, with each council covering a geopolitical area that may vary from a single city to an entire state. Councils receive an annual charter from the National Council and are usually incorporated as a charitable organization.<ref name="bsaorg"/>

The council level organization is similar to that of the National Council. The council executive board is headed by the council president and is made up of annually elected local community leaders.<ref name="r&r"/> The board establishes the council program and carries out the resolutions, policies, and activities of the council. Board members serve without pay and some are volunteer Scouters working at the unit level. Youth members may be selected to the council executive board according to the council by-laws.

The Scout executive manages council operations—including finance, property management, advancement and awards, registrations, and Scout Shop sales—with a staff of other professionals and para-professionals. [[Commissioner Service|Commissioners]] lead the unit service functions of the council, help maintain the standards of the BSA, and assures a healthy unit program.<ref name="Commish">{{cite web|url=http://www.scouting.org/commissioners.aspx|title=Commissioners|year=2008|publisher=Boy Scouts of America|accessdate=2008-07-04}}</ref>

The BSA charters two councils for American Scouts who live overseas, largely on military bases in Europe and Asia. The [[American Scouting overseas#Transatlantic Council|Transatlantic Council]], headquartered in Germany, serves BSA units in much of Europe,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tac-bsa.org/|title=Transatlantic Council|publisher=Transatlantic Council, BSA |accessdate=2008-07-03}}</ref> and the [[American Scouting overseas#Far East Council|Far East Council]], headquartered in Japan, serves units in the western Pacific areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fareastbsa.org/|title=Far East Council|publisher=Far East Council, BSA |accessdate=2008-07-03}}</ref> The [[American Scouting overseas#Direct Service|Direct Service]] branch makes the Scouting movement available to U.S. citizens and their dependents living in countries outside these jurisdictions or in isolated areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.directservicebsa.org/|title=Direct Service, BSA|publisher=Boy Scouts of America|accessdate=2008-07-03}}</ref> The [[Scouting in Hawaii#Aloha Council|Aloha Council]] in Hawaii also serves BSA units in the American territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands and in the sovereign countries of the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alohacouncilbsa.org/|title=Aloha Council|publisher=Aloha Council, BSA |accessdate=2008-07-03}}</ref>

The Greater New York Councils are unique in that they are divided into five [[Borough (New York City)|boroughs]] with each led by a borough Scout executive.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bsa-gnyc.org/openrosters/view_homepage.asp?orgkey=1161 |title=Greater New York Councils|publisher=Greater New York Councils, BSA |accessdate=2008-06-24}}</ref> Each borough is then divided into districts.

Councils are divided into districts with leadership provided by the district executive, district chairman, and the district commissioner.<ref name="bsaorg"/> Districts are directly responsible for the operation of Scouting units and, except for the district executive, are mostly staffed with volunteers.<ref name="r&r"/> The voting members of each district consist of volunteer representatives from each chartered organization having at least one BSA unit, plus annually elected members-at-large who in turn elect the district chairman.  Boroughs and districts are subdivisions of the local council and do not have a separate corporate status.

===Units and chartered organizations===
The unit is the main operating group of the BSA.<ref name="bsaorg"/>
Units use different names for each membership level—Cub Scouts are organized as packs, Boy Scouts as troops, Varsity Scouts as teams, Venturers as crews, and Sea Scouts as ships.

Each unit is operated by a community-based organization such as a business, service organization, school, labor group, or religious institution that has applied for and received an annual charter from the BSA.<ref name="CharteredUnits">{{cite web |url=http://www.scouting.org/Media/FactSheets/02-507.aspx |title=Chartered Organizations and the Boy Scouts of America|year=2008 |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=2008-07-01}}</ref><ref name="Cornell30902">{{cite web|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/36/usc_sec_36_00030902----000-.html|title=Section 30902 Purposes|publisher=Cornell University Law School|accessdate=2008-07-01}}</ref><ref name="fedcharter"/> This chartered organization is responsible for selecting leadership, providing a meeting place, and promoting a good program. The chartered organization representative is the manager of Scouting in a chartered organization and serves as a liaison between the unit, the chartered organization, and the BSA. Chartered organizations use the Scouting program to support the goals and objectives of the organization. As of [[December 31]], [[2007]], the BSA's membership report by chartered organization indicated that approximately 62&nbsp;percent of units are sponsored by religious institutions:

Units are administered by a unit committee appointed by the chartered organization. The unit committee, led by the committee chairman, oversees the unit program and activities and manages record keeping, finance, leadership recruitment, and registration. Each unit is led by a registered and trained leader—a Cubmaster, Scoutmaster, Coach, Advisor, or Skipper. These leaders, with one or more assistants, are appointed by the unit committee and must be approved by both the chartered organization and the local council.  Leaders are required to complete training that gives an overview of the Scouting program, initial and advanced skills required for their position and the [[Youth Protection program (Boy Scouts of America)|Youth Protection program]].  Additional certifications are required for events such as camping, swimming, boating and climbing.  A continuing curriculum is available for additional skills including mentoring, youth leadership, supporting Scouts with disabilities or AD/HD, conducting faith services and [[Leave No Trace]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://olc.scouting.org/|title=BSA Online Learning Center|publisher=Boy Scouts of America|accessdate=2008-07-14}}</ref>

[[Alvin Townley]] wrote in ''Legacy of Honor'' about the large positive impact of Eagle Scouts in America.

[[Peter Applebome]], an editor of ''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote in 2003 of his experience as an adult participating with his son in Scouting activities, "I feel lucky to have had this unexpected vehicle to share my son's youth, to shape it, and to be shaped by it as well".<ref name="Applebome">{{cite book|last=Applebome|first=Peter|title=Scout's Honor: a father's unlikely foray into the woods|publisher=Harcourt|location=Orlando, FL|authorlink=Peter Applebome |year=2003|pages=325 |isbn=0-15-100592-3}}</ref> He concluded that, although Scouting is viewed by some as old-fashioned, "Scouting's core values&nbsp;...&nbsp;are wonderful building blocks for a movement and a life.

===Good Turns===
[[Image:Smokey with scouts.png|thumb|right|[[Smokey Bear]] with members of the Boy Scouts of America and the [[Camp Fire Girls]] celebrating the 50th anniversary of their founding in 1910.]]
From the inception of the Scouting movement, Scouts have been urged to "Do a Good Turn Daily". The first national Good Turn was the promotion of a safe and sane [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] in 1913. During [[World War I]], ''Every Scout to Save a Soldier'' was a slogan used to motivate [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]] and [[Girl Scouts of the USA|Girl Scouts]] to help sell [[War savings stamps]].<ref>WILSON ENLISTS BOY SCOUTS; National Organization Will Help to Get Subscriptions for Loan, May 22, 1917, New York Times[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B05E0D9123AE433A25751C2A9639C946696D6CF]</ref>

[[Scouting for Food]] is an on-going annual program begun in 1986 that collects food for local food banks. In 1997, the BSA developed Service to America with a commitment to provide 200&nbsp;million hours of service by youth members by the end of the year 2000. As part of Service to America, the BSA provided service projects in conjunction with the [[National Park Service]] (NPS). In October 2003, the Department of the Interior expanded the program with the creation of [[Take Pride in America]], opening service to all Americans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.takepride.gov/index.cfm |title=Take Pride in America |publisher=Department of the Interior |accessdate=2008-06-24}}</ref>

Service to America became Good Turn for America in 2004 and expanded to address the problems of hunger, homelessness, and inadequate housing and poor health in conjunction with the Salvation Army, the American Red Cross, Habitat for Humanity, and other organizations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usscouts.org/servicetoamerica.asp |title=Service to America |work=U.S. Scouting Service Project |accessdate=2008-07-22}}</ref>
