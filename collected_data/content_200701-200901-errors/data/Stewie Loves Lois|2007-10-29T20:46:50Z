==Plot summary==
While [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] is at the park, fantasizing beating up [[Lois Griffin|Lois]], his teddy bear [[List of characters from Family Guy#Other characters|Rupert]] is taken by a dangerous [[dog]]. Stewie calls out to someone for help; Lois, noticing his calls, charges after the dog and retrieves Rupert, who has been badly damaged. Later, when Lois fixes Rupert and makes Stewie his favorite dinner to make him feel better, Stewie decides to abandon his murderous plans towards her. Lois notices the change in his demeanor and they begin having a very cheerful mother/baby relationship. As time passes, however, Lois gets worn out by Stewie's clinginess and he eventually gets on her nerves. Then one night, in an almost ironic turn of events, Lois subconsciously develops the urge to commit [[infanticide]], resulting in her having a dream in which she attempts to kill Stewie.

Horrified by her dreams, Lois turns to [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] for assistance in calming her down. Brian suggests Lois ignore Stewie so that he may lose interest in her. She is clearly reluctant, but decides to follow his advice. Stewie takes notice of the plan and tries feigning injury and death to attract Lois' attention, but his attempts are promptly brushed aside. Then, during one of Stewie's rants about Lois' new attitude, he suddenly falls down the stairs and breaks his arm. Lois is so distraught at the sight of her baby son in so much pain that she rushes to his aid. She tries to rekindle their relationship by smothering him, but to no avail. Stewie is so disgusted by Lois' previous attitude that he reverts back to his old, matricidal effort-making self.

Meanwhile, [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] goes to see the doctor for a [[flu vaccine]], but he is informed that he needs a [[Rectal examination|prostate exam]]. However, his exam is not what he expects. Thinking that Doctor Hartman is trying to molest him, Peter enters a period of shock. No matter how many times Lois tries to tell him that it was just a prostate exam, he refuses to believe it. After [[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]], [[Cleveland Brown|Cleveland]], and [[Joe Swanson|Joe]] reveal that Hartman had "violated" them as well, an irate Peter takes Hartman to court. Peter exaggerates the story to make it sound much worse (such as saying Hartman kept on making sexual comments to him and had an evil laugh) and wins the case. Hartman loses his [[medical license]], and Peter believes himself to be victorious, until he begins needing to [[Prostate Cancer#Symptoms|urinate frequently]] (only getting one or two words in before he heads back to the bathroom). He is advised to get a prostate exam by Captain Seamus, but Joe thinks that no doctor in Quahog is going to trust Peter after the lawsuit, nor will anyone out of town, especially [[Leonard McCoy|Dr. McCoy]]. Peter finally gives in and goes to see Dr. Hartman, who reveals the problem to just be some swelling (along with [[Hikaru Sulu|Mr. Sulu]]). Hartman gets his medical license back, and the episode ends in a [[parody]] of ''[[All in the Family]]''.

==Notes==
* Someone other than [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] (Peter) sees the [[Evil Monkey]] (though Peter mistook him for [[Meg Griffin|Meg]], which further shows his disbelief in the monkey shown in earlier episodes).
* Stewie and Peter both speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]] at different times in the show. Stewie says to Brian “''Te mato perro feo. ¿Me entiendes estúpido? ¡Tu eres un imbecil, te odio!''” (“I am going to kill you, ugly dog. Do you understand me, stupid? You are an imbecile, I hate you!”), and Peter answers “''¡Ocupado!''” (“Occupied!”) when Chris knocks on the bathroom door.
* Meg has one line and Chris has three in this episode.
* In some airings of this episode, Peter has his shirt on when he runs all the way home and he also has his hand over his penis when he runs home.
* The plot of this episode during the storyboarding stage contained elements that drastically differ from what was featured in the final version. The animatics of this alternate, early draft version can be viewed on the Volume 5 boxset.
** Originally, Dr. Hartman had no way to pay off the suit filed against him, so the judge gave Peter the deed to the hospital and Hartman's license. Now in possession of the hospital, Peter and the friends he hired all prove to be incompetent doctors. Dr. Hartman would then come in so Peter could give him ''his'' prostate exam, forcing Peter, not knowing how else to perform the checkup other than sticking his finger in his butt, to return the hospital to him.
** While ignoring Stewie feigning his injuries from upstairs, Lois suddenly begins to choke on a potato chip. She nearly suffocates when Stewie, having come down to confront her about her attitude, comes to ''her'' aid by shoving Lois' back, forcng the chip out of her mouth. Grateful to her son for saving her life, Lois begins to smother him until Stewie slaps her in the face, claiming that he needs his space.

==Censorship==
* The [[Adult Swim]] and DVD versions have the last part of the "Mr. Nipple" scene where Peter, while half-asleep, uses his finger to probe around Stewie’s mouth, mistaking it for Lois’s [[vagina]]. The Fox version, however, cuts off when Peter mistakes Stewie’s nose for Lois’s nipple.
* Lois calls Peter a "fucking idiot" after he overreacts about getting "raped" during the prostate exam. The word is bleeped out on Fox and Adult Swim, but can be heard on the uncensored audio on DVD.

==Cultural references==
{{fictionrefs}}
* The family is watching a (fictional) TV show called ''Robin the Boy Wonder'', in which [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] looks like [[Burt Ward]]’s portrayal of the character in the [[Batman (TV series)|1960s ''Batman'' series]]. 
* Peter claims that ''[[Frampton Comes Alive!]]'' was “a monster.” Curiously, [[Peter Frampton]] saved Peter’s marriage by playing for Lois at their anniversary in the episode “[[Death Lives]].”
* In the flashback of Peter’s passing of his exam, the song “I’m Free (Heaven Helps the Man)” (from the ''[[Footloose]]'' soundtrack) by [[Kenny Loggins]] is played.
*there are two references to the Rape Film [[the Accused]] the first one is when peter is thrown onto the pinball machine and the second is when peter cuts his hair short except he talks to himself and puts lipstick on his face Jodie Fosters' character does not do this 
*the scene in which Peter is pushed onto the grass and a carnival is taking place behind Dr. Hartman is a reference to the film ''[[Dr. Giggles]]''. There is also a ''[[American History X]]'' reference when Hartman spanks and is about to penetrate Peter, and the low frequency droning sound in the background is a reference to Gaspar Noe’s ''[[Irréversible]]'', another film notorious for its rape content.
* The flashbacks of Peter's "rape" are almost identical to the style of the flashbacks while playing the game [[Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth]] because of the initial loud sound when cutting to a flashback, the black and white and grainy old-movie style, the heartbeat in the background, and the slowed motion. Peter even notes to the judge how he remembers it being "evil and grainy and black and white."
* [[Kermit the Frog]] is shown to be racist in this episode, in a flashback taken from the opening of ''[[The Muppet Movie]]''. When an African-American asks for directions to town, Kermit replies “Yeah! It’s back the way you came!” after which he pulls out a [[shotgun]] and cocks it.
* Stewie describes Lois as a female [[Bonnie Hunt]].
* Stewie’s explanation for his speaking Spanish is that he fell asleep during ''[[Sábado Gigante]]'', a popular Spanish-language variety television show.
* Stewie testifies against [[Michael Jackson]], a reference to the [[People v. Jackson|2005 molestation trial against him]].
* Lois seems to initially reference [[Andrea Yates]] as a parallel to herself, then changes it to imply that [[Barbara Bush]] gave [[George W. Bush]] [[brain damage]] by holding him under water as a child.
* The eponymous characters from ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'' become “Dr. Jekyll and [[Hikaru Sulu|Mr. Sulu]]” in a cutaway scene.
* During the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Sulu segment, Mr. Sulu says “Hello” in a suggestive tone and eyes a man passing by; this is a reference to the actor who plays Mr. Sulu, [[George Takei]]’s real life homosexuality. 
* ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' is referenced three times, once with the aforementioned Mr. Sulu segment and once with a [[Leonard McCoy|Dr. Leonard McCoy]] scene.  The final more subtle segment is a self referencing nod to the previous "Sulu" segments in which it is assumed that Sulu is the cause of Peter's condition, in that he greeted the doctor with the same suggestive "hello" from Peter's anus.  The ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise had already been spoofed several times by ''Family Guy''. It was notably done in episodes “[[I Never Met the Dead Man]],” “[[When You Wish Upon a Weinstein]]” and “[[Peter's Got Woods|Peter’s Got Woods]]” and the ''Family Guy'' movie ''[[Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!]]''. This further suggests that ''Family Guy'' creator [[Seth MacFarlane]] is a [[Trekkie|''Star Trek'' fan]].
* When Seamus the old pirate is showing Peter the other posters from his wooden arm after showing Peter a diagram of a diseased prostate, the last picture shown is of [[Primus (band)|Primus]]. Other posters on his arm include a map of [[Middle-earth|Middle-Earth]], and a “Hang in There” cat poster.
* After Lois ignores Stewie’s pretended overdose of medication, Stewie asks if this is a “Tommy Lee pool party” referring to the 2001 drowning death of four-year-old [[Tommy Lee#Solo career|Daniel Karven-Veres]] at Tommy Lee’s Malibu home during a birthday party for his son.
* When Brian turns on the TV and changes the channels, Peter sees the title card of ''[[Freddy Got Fingered]]'', the scene from ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|E.T.]]'' where the title character's finger sticks out and a light shines through his finger, and the logo for the [[Yellow Pages]], with the slogan "Let your fingers do the walking."
* The closing credits style and music, is a direct reference to the closing credits of the sitcom [[All in the Family]]
