'''''Raiders of the Lost Ark''''' (also known as '''''Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark''''') is a [[1981 in film|1981]] [[adventure film]] directed by [[Steven Spielberg]], produced by [[George Lucas]] and starring [[Harrison Ford]]. It is the first film in the [[Indiana Jones franchise]], and pits [[Indiana Jones]] (played by Ford) against the [[Nazis]], who search for the [[Ark of the Covenant]], to make their army invincible. Indiana and the Nazis search for a medallion, owned by Indy's old flame [[Marion Ravenwood]] ([[Karen Allen]]), which will pinpoint the [[Well of Souls]] in [[Egypt]], the Ark's resting place. The film also starred [[Paul Freeman]] as Indiana's nemesis, French [[archaeologist]] Rene Belloq, [[John Rhys-Davies]] as Indiana's sidekick [[Sallah]], and [[Denholm Elliott]] as Indiana's colleague, [[Marcus Brody]].

The film's origins came from Lucas' desire to create a modern version of the [[movie serial|serials]] of the 1930s and 1940s. Spielberg originally suggested casting Ford as Jones, but Lucas objected, stating that he did not want the actor, who he'd previously cast as [[Han Solo]] in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' trilogy, to be constantly associated with his films. Lucas persuaded Spielberg to look for someone else and [[Tom Selleck]] was cast in the role, but he was unavailable because of his commitment to the television series ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]''. Production was based at [[Elstree Studios]], [[England]], and filming also took place in [[La Rochelle]], [[Tunisia]], [[Hawaii]] and the [[United States]] from June to September 1980.

When released on [[June 12]], [[1981]], the $20 million (USD) film was a huge success, easily the highest grossing film of 1981, earning $384 million worldwide, and, at the time, one of the [[List of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing movies]] ever made. It was nominated for eight [[Academy Awards]], including Best Picture, in 1982 and won four (Best Sound, Best Film Editing, Best Visual Effects, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration). The film was a hit with audiences and critics alike leading to three additional films, ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'', ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'', ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'', as well as ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'' television series. 

==Plot==
In [[1936]], in the [[Peru]]vian [[jungle]], [[archaeologist]]/treasure hunter Indiana Jones braves several booby traps to retrieve a golden idol from an ancient temple. After escaping, he finds rival archaeologist [[Rene Belloq]] waiting outside with a group of Hovitos, the local [[indigenous people]]. Surrounded and outnumbered, Jones is forced to give up the artifact to Belloq. Jones escapes from Belloq and the Hovitos after a jungle pursuit and flying away on a waiting [[seaplane]]. [[Image:Indianagrabsidol.jpg|thumb|left|Indiana Jones attempts to take the idol in the opening of the film.]]

At the American college where he teaches archaeology, Jones meets with two Army intelligence agents who reveal that the [[Nazi]]s, in their quest for occult power, are searching for [[Abner Ravenwood]], Jones’ former mentor. Ravenwood is the foremost expert on the [[ancient Egypt]]ian city of [[Tanis, Egypt|Tanis]], rediscovered by the Nazis and believed to be where the Pharaoh [[Shishaq]] brought the [[Ark of the Covenant]], a chest the Israelites built to contain the fragments of the [[Ten Commandments]]. Jones surmises that the Nazis seek Ravenwood because he possesses the headpiece to the Staff of [[Ra]], a key artifact essential in pinpointing the Ark’s resting place within the city. His colleague [[Marcus Brody]] explains that, according to legend, the power of the Ark can make any army invincible.

Jones flies to [[Nepal]], only to find that Ravenwood has died, and the headpiece is in the possession of Ravenwood's daughter [[Marion Ravenwood|Marion]], Indy's embittered former lover. The tavern is stormed by Nazi's, led by sadistic [[Nazi]] agent named [[Arnold Toht|Toht]]. A firefight immediately breaks out, burning Marion's tavern to the ground, and searing the face of the medallion onto Toht's hand. Jones and Marion narrowly escape with the headpiece, and the two travel to [[Cairo]] and meet up with [[Sallah]], a skilled Egyptian digger who knows where the Nazis, now being assisted by Belloq and a replica of the headpiece, are digging for the Ark. In a Cairo [[bazaar]] Nazi operatives kidnap Marion and fake her death in front of Jones. That evening, Sallah and Jones decipher the carvings on the headpiece to determine the Staff's length – which are written on both its sides. Belloq made his ''single-sided'' replica using Toht's scarred hand. They realize that the Nazis' staff is too long, causing them to dig in the wrong place.
[[Image:IndySallahArk.jpg|thumb|left|Indiana and Sallah lift up the Ark of the Covenant]]
Infiltrating the dig, Indy sneaks into the map room, which contains a scale model of the city of Tanis. According to legend, the headpiece would reveal the exact location of the [[Well of Souls]], the chamber containing the Ark, by focusing daylight onto the city mock-up at a certain time of day. Although Sallah is nearly exposed and captured in the attempt, Indy successfully acquires the location. He and Sallah gather a small crew and begin to dig at the correct location. After several hours, they break through the roof of the buried Well of Souls. Jones is lowered to the floor of the temple and finds it infested with multitudes of poisonous [[Cerastes vipera|Egyptian asps]], of which [[Ophidiophobia|he is deathly afraid]]. After he and Sallah hoist the Ark out of the temple, Belloq and the Nazis appear and take possession of the Ark. Marion is tossed into the Well with Jones, and they are sealed in. The duo manage to escape, emerging aboveground in time to find a [[Luftwaffe]] [[flying wing]] being prepared to transport the Ark to [[Berlin]].  After a brief fight, the plane is destroyed. The Ark is put on a truck to Cairo, where it will be shipped to Berlin. Stealing a horse, Jones pursues the convoy escorting the truck, seizes control of the vehicle and, after an extended pursuit, escapes with the Ark. That evening, Jones and Marion leave Sallah to escort the Ark to [[England]] onboard the [[tramp steamer]] ''Bantu Wind''.

The next morning, a Nazi [[U-boat]] commanded by Belloq and Nazi officer Dietrich stops the ship. Marion and the Ark are removed, while Jones covertly boards the U-boat. He follows Belloq and the Ark to an isolated island, where they plan to test the power of the Ark before presenting it to the Führer. Threatening to destroy the Ark with a rocket launcher, Jones demands that the Nazis free Marion. Belloq calls his bluff, claiming that Indy, as an archaeologist, wants to see it opened as badly as Belloq; Jones is forced to surrender. Marion and Indy are tied up while Belloq performs a ceremonial opening of the Ark. Spirits emerge from within; Indy, aware of the supernatural danger of looking at the opened Ark, warns Marion to close her eyes. Belloq and the Nazis, who do not look away, are gruesomely killed by the Ark's supernatural powers, and the Ark closes itself once more with a crack of thunder. Back in [[Washington, D.C.]], the two Army intelligence men tell a suspicious Jones that "top men" are carefully studying the Ark. In reality, the Ark is sealed in a wooden crate and stored in a giant [[Government Warehouse|government warehouse]] filled with countless similar crates.

===Development===
In 1973, [[George Lucas]] wrote ''The Adventures of Indiana Smith''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Marcus Hearn| title =The Cinema of George Lucas| publisher =Harry N.

Friend and colleague [[Steven Spielberg]] was also there, on holiday from work on ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]''.  While building a sand castle at [[Mauna Kea]],<ref>{{cite news | author = Jim Windolf | title = Q&A: Steven Spielberg | publisher = [[Vanity Fair]] | date = [[2007-12-02]] | url = http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/02/spielberg_qanda200802?currentPage=4 | accessdate=2007-12-02}}</ref> Spielberg expressed an interest in directing a [[James Bond]] film. Lucas convinced his friend Spielberg that he had conceived a character "better than James Bond" and explained the concept of ''Raiders of the Lost Ark''. Spielberg loved it, calling it "a James Bond film without the hardware",<ref name="mcbride">{{cite book | last = McBride | first =Joseph | authorlink =Joseph McBride | title = Steven Spielberg | publisher =Faber and Faber | date =1997 | location =[[New York City]] | pages =309-322 | id = ISBN 0-571-19177-0 |chapter=Rehab}}</ref> although Spielberg told Lucas that the surname Smith was not right for the character, Lucas replied "OK. What about [[Jones (surname)|Jones]]?". Indiana was the name of Lucas's dog.<ref name="makingthetrilogy"/>

The following year, Lucas focused on developing ''Raiders'' and the ''Star Wars'' sequel ''[[Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back|The Empire Strikes Back]]'', during which [[Lawrence Kasdan]] and [[Frank Marshall (movie producer)|Frank Marshall]] joined the project as screenwriter and producer respectively. Between [[January 23]]-[[January 27]], [[1978]] for nine hours a day, Lucas, Kasdan and Spielberg discussed the story and visual ideas. Spielberg came up with Jones being chased by a boulder,<ref name="makingthetrilogy"/> and Lucas came up with a submarine, a monkey giving the [[Nazi salute]], and Marion punching Jones in [[Nepal]].<ref name="mcbride"/> Kasdan used a 100 page transcript of their conversations for his first script draft,<ref>Hearn, p.122–123</ref> which he worked on for six months.<ref name="makingthetrilogy"/> Ultimately some of their ideas were too grand and had to be cut: a mine chase,<ref>Script [http://www.movie-page.com/scripts/Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark.html 3rd Draft], scene 45-47</ref> an escape in [[Shanghai]] using a rolling gong as a shield,<ref>Script [http://www.movie-page.com/scripts/Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark.html 3rd Draft], scene 148-155</ref> and a jump from an airplane in a raft, all of which made it into the [[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom|prequel]].<ref name="makingthetrilogy"/>

Spielberg and Lucas disagreed on the character: although Lucas saw him as a Bondian playboy, Kasdan and Spielberg felt the professor and adventurer elements of the character made him complex enough. Spielberg had darker visions of Jones, interpreting him as an [[alcoholic]] similar to [[Humphrey Bogart]]'s character Fred C. Dobbs in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]''. This characterization fell away during the later drafts.<ref name="mcbride"/> Spielberg also initially conceived of Toht with a robotic arm, which Lucas rejected as falling into science-fiction. Comic book artist [[Jim Steranko]] was also commissioned to produce original illustrations for pre-production, which heavily influenced Spielberg's decisions in both the [[Indiana Jones#Costume and equipment|look]] of the film and the character of Indiana Jones himself.<ref name="twenty-five">{{cite news | title = Raiders Of The Lost Ark: An Oral History | publisher = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire Online]] | date = [[2008-04-24]] | url = http://www.empireonline.com/indy/day3/ | accessdate=2008-04-24}}</ref>

As ''The Empire Strikes Back'' began post-production in September 1979, Lucas made a deal with Paramout Pictures to produce five ''Indiana Jones'' films. By April 1980, Kasdan's fifth draft was produced, and production was getting ready to shoot at [[Elstree Studios]], with Lucas trying to keep costs down.<ref name="lucas prod">Hearn, p.127-134</ref> With four illustrators, ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' was Spielberg's most [[storyboard]]ed film of his career to date, further helping the film economically, and he and Lucas agreed on a tight schedule to stylistically follow the "quick and dirty" feel of the Saturday matinée serials.<ref name="makingthetrilogy"/> "We didn't do 30 or 40 takes &mdash; production; usually only four. It was like silent film &mdash; shoot only what you need, no waste," Spielberg said. "Had I had more time and money, it would have turned out a [[wiktionary:pretentious|pretentious]] movie." Lucas also directed some of the [[second unit]].<ref name=time>{{cite news | author = [[Richard Schickel]] | title = Slam! Bang!

===Filming===
Filming began on [[June 23]], [[1980]] at [[La Rochelle]], [[France]], for scenes involving the Nazi submarine,<ref name="lucas prod"/> which was rented from the movie ''[[Das Boot]]''. The U-boat pen was a genuine one that had survived from [[World War II]].<ref name="makingthetrilogy"/> The crew moved to [[Elstree Studios]]<ref name="lucas prod"/> for scenes involving the [[Well of Souls]], the interiors of the temple in the opening sequence and [[Marion Ravenwood]]'s bar.<ref name="world">{{cite web|author=Marco Fromter|title=Around the World with Indiana Jones|publisher=Official Website|date=[[2006-08-18]]|url=http://www.indianajones.com/raiders/bts/news/f20060818/index.html|accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref> The Well of Souls required 7,000 snakes, though the only poisonous snakes on set were the [[cobras]]. However, one crew member was bitten by a python on set.<ref name="makingthetrilogy"/> To shoot the scene where Indiana comes face-to-face with the cobra, a glass sheet was put between Ford and the animal, partially visible when the light hits it at a certain [[angle]].<ref name="makingthetrilogy"/> Unlike the character he portrayed, Ford does not actually have a fear of snakes; Spielberg was not afraid either, but seeing all the snakes on the set writhing around made him "want to puke".<ref name="makingthetrilogy"/> The opening sequence featured live [[tarantulas]]: [[Alfred Molina]] had to have many put on him, but they did not move until a female tarantula was introduced. A [[fibreglass]] boulder 22&nbsp;feet in diameter was made for the scene where Indiana escapes the temple; Spielberg was so impressed by production designer Norman Reynolds' realization of his idea that he told Reynolds to increase the length of the boulder run by 50ft.<ref>{{cite video|people= Norman Reynolds (Production Designer)|title= Making the Trilogy|medium= DVD|time= 17:40|quote= "Steven said 'Why don't we make it another 50ft longer?' Which of course we did"}}</ref>

All of the scenes set in [[Egypt]] and the canyon where Indiana threatens to blow up the Ark were filmed in [[Tunisia]]; many of the locations were used in the [[Tatooine]] scenes from ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'', since many people in the location crew were the same for both films.<ref name="makingthetrilogy"/> Notably, that canyon was the exact same location wherein [[R2-D2]] was attacked by [[List of Star Wars races (F-J)#Jawa|Jawas]].<ref name="makingthetrilogy"/>  Filming there was a harsh experience due to the heat and disease. Several members of the cast and crew fell ill; Rhys-Davies in particular defecated in his costume during one shot.<ref name="makingthetrilogy"/>  Spielberg was never ill, as he only ate tinned foods from England.<ref name="makingthetrilogy"/> Spielberg did not like the area and quickly pushed forward a scheduled six-week shoot to four-and-a-half weeks. Much was improvised there: the scene wherein Marion puts on her dress and attempts to leave Belloq's tent was improvised, as was the entire plane fight. During shooting of that scene, Ford tore his [[cruciate ligament]] in his left leg as a wheel went over his knee, but he did not accept medical help and simply put ice over it.<ref name="makingthetrilogy"/> The fight scenes in the town were filmed in [[Kairouan]]; by then Ford was suffering from [[dysentery]]. He had enough, and did not want to shoot a fight scene between Indiana and a swordsman. He said to Spielberg "Why don't we just shoot the sucker?" Spielberg agreed, scrapped the rest of the fight scene, and filmed the gag of Indiana quickly shooting the swordsman.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Urban Legends of Indiana Jones|publisher=Official website|date=[[2004-01-13]]|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070612222640/http://www.indianajones.com/raiders/bts/news/f20040113/index.html|accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref> The truck chase was shot entirely by the second-unit who mostly followed Spielberg's storyboards, though they decided to add Indiana being dragged by the truck. Spielberg shot all the close-ups with Ford afterwards.<ref name="makingthetrilogy"/>

The interior staircase set in [[Washington, D.C.]] was filmed inside of [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]'s [[San Francisco City Hall|City Hall]]. The [[University of the Pacific (United States)|University of the Pacific]], located in [[Stockton, California]], stands in for the exterior of the college where Jones works, while his classroom and the hall where he meets the American intelligence men was filmed at the [[Royal Masonic School for Girls]] in Hertfordshire, England. His home exteriors were filmed in the city of [[San Rafael, California]].<ref name="world"/> The opening exteriors were filmed in [[Kauai, Hawaii]], with Spielberg wrapping in September, finishing under schedule in 73&nbsp;days, in contrast to his previous film, ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]''.<ref name="mcbride"/><ref name="lucas prod"/> The Washington, D.C. exterior was not included in early edits and, although it appeared in early drafts of the script, was actually added later when it was realised that there was no resolution to Indy's relationship with Marion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Twenty-Five Reasons to Watch Raiders Again|publisher=Official website|date=[[2006-06-12]]|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070610051833/http://www.indianajones.com/raiders/bts/news/f20060612/indexp4.html|accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref> Shots of the [[Douglas DC-3]] Indy flies on to Nepal were taken from ''[[Lost Horizon (1973 film)|Lost Horizon]]'', while a street scene was cut from a shot in ''[[The Hindenburg (film)|The Hindenburg]]''.<ref name=time/>

===Effects===
Special effects were provided by [[Industrial Light & Magic]]. These largely featured in the climactic sequence where the Ark of the Covenant is opened and spirits come out to attack the Nazis. The melting of Toht's head was done by exposing a wax model of Ronald Lacey's head to a heat lamp with an under cranked camera, while Dietrich's crushed head was a hollow model from which air was withdrawn. To avoid an [[R rating]], fire was double exposed over Belloq's exploding head. The spirits were shot underwater for a ghostly look.<ref name="magic">{{cite video | title = The Light and Magic of Indiana Jones | format = DVD | publisher = [[Paramount Pictures]] | year = 2003}}</ref> 

[[Ben Burtt]] was sound effects supervisor, picking a [[30-30 Winchester]] rifle for the sound of Jones' gun; for the various punching noises throughout the film, leather jackets and baseball gloves were whacked by a baseball bat to continue the [[comic-book]]ish feel of the film. For the snakes in the Well of Souls sequence, cheese casserole and sponges were used for the slithering, while lifting a toilet tank was used for the sound of opening the Ark. Burtt used a synthesizer for the sounds of the Ark, and mixed dolphins' and sea lions' screams for those of the spirits within.<ref>{{cite video | title = The Sound of Indiana Jones | format = DVD | publisher = [[Paramount Pictures]] | year = 2003}}</ref>

==Cast==
*'''[[Harrison Ford]]''' stars as '''[[Indiana Jones]]''', an adventurous archaeology professor who often embarks on perilous adventures to obtain rare artifacts. Jones initially claims he has no belief in the supernatural, only to have his skepticism challenged when he discovers the Ark. Spielberg suggested casting [[Harrison Ford]] as Jones, but Lucas objected, stating that he did not want Ford to become his "[[Robert De Niro|Bobby De Niro]]" or "that guy I put in all my movies", a reference to [[Martin Scorsese]], who often worked with De Niro.<ref name="makingthetrilogy"/> Desiring a lesser known actor, Lucas persuaded Spielberg to help him search for a new talent. Among the actors who auditioned were [[Tim Matheson]], [[Peter Coyote]], [[John Shea]] and [[Tom Selleck]]. Selleck was originally cast in the role, but he was unavailable for the part because of his commitment to the television series ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]''<ref name="makingthetrilogy"/> In June 1980, three weeks away from filming,<ref name="facts and trivia">{{cite web|title=Facts and trivia of the Lost Ark|publisher=Official website|date=[[2003-10-14]]|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070518230319/http://www.indianajones.com/raiders/bts/news/news20031014.html|accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref> Spielberg persuaded Lucas to cast Ford after producers Marshall and [[Kathleen Kennedy (movie producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]] were impressed by his performance as [[Han Solo]] in ''The Empire Strikes Back''.<ref name="lucas prod"/>
   
*'''[[Karen Allen]]''' as '''[[Marion Ravenwood]]''', a spirited, tough old flame of Indiana's. She is the daughter of Abner Ravenwood, Indiana Jones' mentor, and owns a bar in Nepal. Allen was cast after auditioning with Matheson and [[John Shea]]. Spielberg was interested in her, as he had seen her performance in ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House]]''. [[Sean Young]] had previously auditioned for the part,<ref name="makingthetrilogy"/> while [[Debra Winger]] turned it down.<ref>{{cite news | author = Gregory Kirschling, Jeff Labrecque | title = Indiana Jones: 15 Fun Facts | publisher = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = [[2008-03-12]] | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20183746,00.html | accessdate=2008-03-15}}</ref>

*'''[[Paul Freeman]]''' as '''Dr. [[René Belloq]]'''. Jones' arch nemesis, Belloq is also an archaeologist after the Ark, but he is working for the Nazis. He intends to harness the power of the Ark himself before [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] could, but he is killed by the supernatural powers of the Ark after opening it when his head explodes.

*'''[[Ronald Lacey]]''' as '''Major [[Toht]]'''. Toht is an interrogator for the Nazis, who tries to torture Marion Ravenwood for the headpiece of the Staff of Ra. He only manages to obtain one side of it through a burn in his hand. He is killed by the supernatural powers of the Ark when his face melts. Lacey was cast as he reminded Spielberg of [[Peter Lorre]].<ref name="makingthetrilogy"/> [[Klaus Kinski]] was offered the role, but he hated the script.<ref>{{cite news | author = Glenn Whipp | title = Keeping up with Jones | publisher = [[Halifax Chronicle-Herald]] | date = [[2008-05-22]] | url = http://thechronicleherald.ca/ArtsLife/1057438.html | accessdate=2008-05-22}}</ref>

*'''[[John Rhys-Davies]]''' as '''[[Sallah]]'''. Sallah is "the best digger in Cairo", and has been hired by the Nazis to help them excavate Tanis. Although he is suspicious of the Ark's power, he is an old friend of Indiana Jones, and agrees to help him obtain the Ark. Initially, Spielberg approached [[Danny DeVito]] to play Sallah, but could not play the part due to scheduling conflicts. Spielberg cast Rhys-Davies after seeing his performance in ''[[Shōgun (TV miniseries)|Shogun]]''.<ref name="makingthetrilogy"/>

*'''[[Denholm Elliott]]''' as '''Dr. [[Marcus Brody]]'''. Marcus is a museum curator, and buys whatever artifacts Indiana obtains for display in his museum. The US governmental agents approach him in regards to recovering the Ark, and he sets up a meeting between them and Indiana Jones. Spielberg hired Elliott as he was a big fan of him.<ref name="makingthetrilogy"/>

*'''[[Wolf Kahler]]''' as '''[[Colonel Dietrich]]'''. Dietrich is a ruthless Nazi officer leading the operation to secure the Ark. He is killed by the supernatural powers of the Ark when his head implodes.

*'''[[Alfred Molina]]''', in his film debut, as '''[[List of characters in the Indiana Jones series#Satipo|Satipo]]'''. Satipo is one of Jones's guides through the South American jungle. He betrays Jones and steals the golden idol, but is killed by one of the traps in the temple.

Producer [[Frank Marshall (movie producer)|Frank Marshall]] played a pilot in the airplane fight sequence. The stunt team was ill, so he took the role instead. The result was three days in a hot cockpit, which he joked was over "140 degrees".<ref name="makingthetrilogy"/> [[Pat Roach]] plays the large mechanic with whom Jones brawls in this sequence, as well as Toht's henchman in Marion's bar. He had the rare opportunity to be killed twice in one movie.<ref>{{cite video | title = The Stunts of Indiana Jones | format = DVD | publisher = [[Paramount Pictures]] | year = 2003}}</ref> Special-effects supervisor [[Dennis Muren]] made a [[cameo appearance | cameo]] on the plane Indiana Jones takes to [[Nepal]].<ref name="magic"/>

''Raiders of the Lost Ark'''s score is most notable for featuring the rousing and iconic composition "The Raiders March" that came to symbolize Indiana Jones. The tune was composed by [[John Williams]]. The score also featured three other prominent themes: the grand yet mysterious "Ark Theme", a theme associated with Marion, and the loud, pompous Nazi March, which harkens back to 1940s film scores. The score had received an Oscar nomination for best original score, but lost to [[Vangelis]]'s similarly iconic electro-synth based score for ''[[Chariots of Fire]]''. John Williams composed the march in the two separate segments. When he played them for Steven Spielberg he told Williams that he liked them both, which led to the combined theme people know today.<ref>{{cite video|people=[[John Williams]]|title=The Music of Indiana Jones|format=[[DVD]]|publisher=[[Paramount Pictures]]|year=2003}}</ref>

==Release==
===Reception===
When released on [[June 12]], [[1981]] the $20&nbsp;million film was a huge success, easily the highest grossing film (earning $384&nbsp;million worldwide) of that year, and, at the time, one of the highest-grossing movies ever made.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Raiders of the Lost Ark''|publisher=Box Office Mojo|date=[[2007-07-12]]|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=raidersofthelostark.htm|accessdate=2007-07-12}}</ref> It was nominated for eight [[Academy Awards]], including Best Picture, in 1982 and won four (Best Sound, Best Film Editing, Best Visual Effects, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration).

The film opened to mostly positive reviews from critics. In his review for the ''[[New York Times]]'', [[Vincent Canby]] praised the film, calling it, "one of the most deliriously funny, ingenious and stylish American adventure movies ever made."<ref>{{cite news | author = [[Vincent Canby]] | title = ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' | publisher = [[New York Times]] | date = [[June 12]], [[1981]] | url = http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?res=9D00E3DC103BF931A25755C0A967948260 | accessdate =2007-05-21}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] in his review for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' wrote, "Two things, however, make ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' more than just a technological triumph: its sense of humor and the droll style of its characters [...] We find ourselves laughing in surprise, in relief, in incredulity at the movie's ability to pile one incident upon another in an inexhaustible series of inventions."<ref>{{cite news | author = [[Roger Ebert]] | title = ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' | publisher = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date = [[January 1]], [[1981]] | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19810101/REVIEWS/101010360/1023 | accessdate =2007-05-21}}</ref> He later added it to his list of "Great Movies".<ref name=ebert>{{cite news | author = [[Roger Ebert]] | title = ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' | publisher = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date = [[April 30]], [[2000]] | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20000430/REVIEWS08/4300301/1023 | accessdate =2007-06-04}}</ref> Stephen Klain of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' also praised the film.

===Impact===
Following the box office success of ''Raiders'', two more feature films were produced: ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'', a prequel, and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]''. A TV series, entitled ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'', was also spun off from this film, and details the early years of the character. Another sequel, ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'', was released on [[May 22]], [[2008]]. Numerous other books, [[Indiana Jones Comics|comics]], and video games have also been produced.

In 1998, the [[American Film Institute]] placed the film at number 60 on its top 100 films of the first century of cinema. In 1999, the film was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" by the United States [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]]. Indiana Jones has become an icon, being listed as ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'''s third favorite action hero, while noting "some of the greatest action scenes ever filmed are strung together like pearls" in this film.<ref>{{cite news | author = Marc Bernadin | title = 25 Awesome Action Heroes | publisher = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = [[2007-10-23]] | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20041669_20041686_20153598_22,00.html | accessdate=2007-12-11}}</ref>

An amateur shot-for-shot remake was made by Chris Strompolos, Eric Zala and Jayson Lamb, then children in [[Ocean Springs, Mississippi]]. It took the boys seven years to finish, from 1982-1989. After production of the film, called ''Raiders of the Lost Ark: The Adaptation'', wrapped in 1989, it was shelved and forgotten until 2003, where it was discovered by [[Eli Roth]]<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Harry Knowles]]|title=RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK shot-for-shot teenage remake review!!!|publisher=[[Ain't It Cool News]]|date=[[2003-05-31]]|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=15348|accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref> and acclaimed by Spielberg himself<ref>{{cite web|title=Quotes on The Adaptation|publisher=The Indy Experience|url=http://www.theindyexperience.com/raiders_adaptation/raiders_adaptation_press.php|accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref> who congratulated the boys on their hard work and said he looked forward to seeing their names on the big screen.<ref>{{cite news|author=Sarah Hepola|title=Lost Ark Resurrected|publisher=[[Austin Chronicle]]|date=[[2003-05-30]]|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/dispatch/2003-05-30/screens_feature4.html|accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref> [[Scott Rudin]] and [[Paramount Pictures]] have purchased the trio's life rights and will be producing a film based on their adventures making their remake.<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Harry Knowles]]|title=Sometimes, The Good Guys Win!!!

===Merchandise===
The only [[video game]] based exclusively on this movie is ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark (Atari 2600)|Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', released in 1982 by [[Atari]] for their [[Atari 2600]] console. The first third of the video game ''[[Indiana Jones' Greatest Adventures]]'', released in 1994 by JVC for [[Nintendo]]'s [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], is based entirely on the film. Several sequences from the film are reproduced (the boulder run and the showdown with the Cairo Swordsman among them); however, several inconsistencies with the film are present in the game, such as Nazi soldiers and bats being present in the Well of Souls sequence, for example. The game was developed by [[LucasArts]] and [[Factor 5]]. In ''[[Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine]]'' a bonus level brings Indy back to 'Peru, South America' from this movie. He can explore the cave and he discovers another hidden idol. LucasArts will release ''[[Lego Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures]]'' in the summer of 2008 to coincide with the release of ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]''. [[Lego]] also released several [[Lego Indiana Jones|building sets]] based on the film in early 2008.

In 1981, [[Kenner]] released a 12-inch doll of Indiana Jones, and the following year they released nine action figures of the characters in the film, three [[playset]]s as well as toys of the Nazi truck and Indy's horse. They also released a [[board game]]. In 1984, miniature metal versions of the characters were released for a [[role playing game]], and in 1995 [[Micro Machines]] released [[die-cast toy]]s of the vehicles in the film.<ref>{{cite web | title = The Adventures of Indiana Jones | publisher = Cool Toy Review | url = http://www.cooltoyreview.com/Kenner_IJ.asp | accessdate=2008-02-21}}</ref> [[Hasbro]] released action figures based on the film, ranging from 3 to 12-inches, to coincide with ''Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'' on [[May 1]], [[2008]].<ref>{{cite news | author = Edward Douglas | title = Hasbro Previews G.I.

===Home video===
The film was released on [[VHS]] in [[pan and scan]] only and on [[laserdisc]] in both pan and scan and [[widescreen]]. For its 1999 VHS re-issue, the film was remastered in [[THX]] and for the first time was made available in widescreen. The outer package was retitled ''Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark'' to correlate with the film's prequel and sequel. The subsequent [[DVD]] release in 2003 features this title as well. The title in the film itself remains unchanged, even in the restored DVD print. In the DVD, the glass partition separating Indy from the cobra in the Well of Souls was digitally removed.<ref>{{cite web | author = Miss Cellania | title = 10 Awesome Indiana Jones Facts | publisher = [[Mental floss]] | date = [[2008-05-21]] | url = http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/15081 | accessdate=2008-05-24}}</ref> The film (along with ''Temple of Doom'' and ''Last Crusade'') was re-released on DVD with additional extra features not included on the previous set on [[May 13]], [[2008]].
