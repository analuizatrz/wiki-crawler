The '''Mars Scout Program''' is a new [[NASA]] program of small, low-cost missions to [[Mars]], selected from innovative proposals by the scientific community.  The first planned mission in this program is "[[Phoenix (spacecraft)|Phoenix]]", a lander originally intended for the cancelled [[Mars Surveyor 2001 Lander|Mars Surveyor]] mission.  Phoenix is scheduled to be launched during August of [[2007]], and will land on the icy northern pole of the planet.

The [[Mars 2011|second set of Scout missions]] are under review and projected to launch in [[2011]].
