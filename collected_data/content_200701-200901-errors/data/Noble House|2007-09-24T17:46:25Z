'''''Noble House''''' is a [[novel]] by [[James Clavell]], published in [[1981]] and set in [[Hong Kong]] in [[1963]].  It is part of Clavell's [[The Asian Saga|Asian Saga]].

It is a massive book, well over 1000 pages, with dozens of characters and numerous intermingling plot lines. In 1988, it was [[Noble House (miniseries)|adapted as a television miniseries]] for [[NBC]] starring [[Pierce Brosnan]]. The miniseries updates the storyline of the novel to the 1980s. 

''The Noble House'' also is a nickname of [[Struans|Struan's]], the trading company featured prominently in most of Clavell's novels.

==Plot summary==

''Noble House'' is set in [[1963]]. The [[tai-pan]], Ian Dunross, struggles to rescue Struan's from the precarious financial position left over from his predecessor.  To do this, he seeks partnership with an American millionaire, while trying to ward off Quillan Gornt, who seeks to destroy Struan's once and for all.  Meanwhile, Chinese communists, Taiwanese nationalists, and Soviet spies illegally vie for influence in Hong Kong while the British government seeks to prevent this.  And nobody, it seems, can get anything done without enlisting the aid of Hong Kong's criminal underworld.

A major difference between the original novel and the later miniseries adaptation is the television version changes the setting from 1963 to the late 1980s, and updates visible technology accordingly.

Struan and Company is based on [[Jardine Matheson Holdings|Jardine Matheson]] which continues to exist to this day as an Asia based trading company. The chief character, Ian Dunross, is believed to have been a composite character of two Jardine tai-pans, Sir [[Hugh Barton]] and Sir [[Michael Herries]].

==Main characters==
*'''Robert Armstrong''' - Armstrong serves as a police inspector in [[Hong Kong]]. Because of his skill and intelligence, he was promoted to Special Intelligence, a branch concerned with counter-espionage.
*'''Lincoln Bartlett''' - American millionaire, head of Par-Con Industries.  He is a devotee on [[Sun Tzu]] and views business as a kind of war.  He believes in corporate espionage and misleading his partners as he vies for advantage.  But he is an honest businessman according to the rules that he accepts, and he does not engage in illegal activities. He is in love with his Executive Vice President, Casey Tcholok.
*'''Phillip Chen''' - He is a director and fourth compradore of [[Struan's]], and a descendant of the company's founder, Dirk Struan.  His full name is Phillip T'Chung Sheng Chen.
*'''Roger Crosse''' - Senior superintendent, director of Special Intelligence, meaning he is the senior British intelligence officer in [[Hong Kong]].
*'''Ian Dunross''' - Tenth tai-pan of Struan's. Dunross finds his company the target of a hostile takeover from his arch-rival Quillan Gornt at a time when it is desperately overextended.  He is also embroiled in international espionage when he finds himself in possession of secret documents desperately desired by both the [[KGB]] and [[MI6]].
*'''Quillan Gornt''' - Gornt is the [[tai-pan]] of Rothwell-Gornt, a major [[Hong Kong]] trading company.  As a descendant of [[Tyler Brock]], he is the blood enemy of [[Ian Dunross]] and the entire [[Struan's]] company, which Gornt seeks to destroy. Gornt schemes to persuade millionaire [[Lincoln Bartlett]] to partner with him, rather than with Dunross.  He uses whatever devious and underhanded means available to accomplish this, while trying his best to seduce Bartlett's partner and vice-president Casey Tcholok.
*'''Brian Kwok''' - Hong Kong police Superintendent, working in Special Intelligence. He is being groomed to be the first ever Chinese assistant police commissioner. He was sent to Hong Kong from mainland China at age 6, won a scholarship to an English [[public school (England)|public school]] at age 12, two years later in 1939 moved to Canada because of the war.

In the meantime, Bartlett is exploring doing the deal with Struan's rival Quillan Gornt.  Casey finds herself being drawn to both Gornt and Struan's tai-pan Ian Dunross, while watching with dread as Bartlett falls in love with Gornt's protege Orlanda Ramos.
*'''Four Finger Wu''' - Sang Fang Wu is the head of the seaborne Wu, a large smuggling fleet.  He boasts his fleet will smuggle anything, anywhere.  This includes [[narcotic]] smuggling.

[[Ian Dunross]], the current tai-pan of Struan's, continues to cultivate this relationship, though he encourages Wu to avoid narcotics trafficking as being too dangerous.
