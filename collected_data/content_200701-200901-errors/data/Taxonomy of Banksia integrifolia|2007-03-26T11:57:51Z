[[Image:B integrifolia integrifolia1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Inflorescence]] and leaves of ''Banksia integrifolia'' subsp. ''integrifolia'']]
The '''taxonomy of ''Banksia integrifolia''''' has a long and complex history, the result of confusion caused by the species' great variability, similarities with some closely related species, the existence of hybrids between ''[[Banksia integrifolia|B.&nbsp;integrifolia]]'' and related species, and early attempts to classify the species based on dried specimen material alone. It is now largely settled, with the species now placed in ''[[Banksia]]'' [[Banksia subg. Banksia|subg. ''Banksia'']] [[Banksia sect. Banksia|sect. ''Banksia'']] [[Banksia ser. Salicinae|ser. ''Salicinae'']], and divided into three subspecies: [[Banksia integrifolia subsp. compar|''B.&nbsp;i.'' subsp. ''compar'']], [[Banksia integrifolia subsp. integrifolia|''B.&nbsp;i.'' subsp. ''integrifolia'']], and [[Banksia integrifolia subsp. monticola|''B.&nbsp;i.'' subsp. ''monticola'']]. The only remaining bones of contention are the relationships between ''B.&nbsp;integrifolia'' and several closely related species within series ''Salicinae''.

==Background==
{{main|Banksia integrifolia}}
Commonly known as Coast Banksia, ''B.&nbsp;integrifolia'' is one of the best known and most widely distributed species of ''Banksia''. Widely distributed along the east coast of [[Australia]] from [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] to [[Central Queensland|Central]] [[Queensland]], it is highly variable in form, but is most often encountered as a tree up to 25 metres (75&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]) in height. Hardy and versatile, it is a popular garden plant.

==Discovery==
[[Image:Banksia integrifolia watercolour from Banks' Florilegium.jpg|thumb|left|''B&nbsp;integrifolia'' from ''[[Banks' Florilegium]]''.]]
The first botanical collection of ''B.&nbsp;integrifolia'' was made by [[Joseph Banks|Sir Joseph Banks]] and [[Daniel Solander|Dr Daniel Solander]], naturalists on the ''[[HM Bark Endeavour|Endeavour]]'' during Lieutenant (later Captain) [[James Cook]]'s first voyage to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Cook landed on Australian soil for the first time on [[29 April]] [[1770]], at a place that he later named [[Botany Bay]] in recognition of "the great quantity of plants Mr Banks and Dr Solander found in this place".<ref name="Wharton 1893">{{cite book | author = [[James Cook|Cook, James]] | year = 1893 | editor = William J. L. Wharton (ed.) | title = [[Wikisource:Captain Cook's Journal, First Voyage|Captain Cook's Journal during his First Voyage Round the World made in H. M. Bark "Endeavour" 1768-71: A Literal Transcription of the Original MSS]] | location = London | publisher = E. Stock}}</ref> Over the next seven weeks, Banks and Solander collected thousands of plant specimens, including the first specimens of a new genus that would later be named ''Banksia'' in Banks' honour.

Every specimen collected during the ''Endeavour'' voyage was sketched by Banks' [[botanical illustrator]] [[Sydney Parkinson]]. On the ''Endeavour''<div/>'s return to [[England]] in July 1771, Banks' specimens became part of his [[London]] [[herbarium]], and artists were employed to paint [[watercolour]]s from Parkinson's sketches. Banks had plans to publish his entire collection as "[[Banks' Florilegium]]", but for various reasons the project was never completed, and it would be ten years before any of the ''Banksia'' species were formally published.<ref name="Salkin 1981">{{cite journal | author = Salkin, A.

==Taxonomic history==
[[Image:Supplementum Plantarum Systematis Vegetabilium.jpg|thumb|right|''B.&nbsp;integrifolia'' was first described by [[Carolus Linnaeus the Younger]] in his April 1782 publication ''[[Supplementum Plantarum]]''.]]
The genus ''Banksia'' was eventually described by [[Carolus Linnaeus the Younger]] in his April 1782 publication ''[[Supplementum Plantarum]]''. Linnaeus described four ''Banksia'' species, distinguishing them by their leaf shape, and naming them accordingly. Thus the species with [[Leaf#Margins (edge)|entire leaf margins]] was given the specific name ''integrifolia'', from the Latin ''integer'', meaning "entire", and ''folium'', meaning "leaf".<ref name="L.f. 1782">{{cite book | author = [[Carolus Linnaeus the Younger]] | year = 1782 | title = [[Supplementum Plantarum|Supplementum Plantarum Systema Vegetabilium Editionis Decima Tertia, Generum Plantarum Editionis Fexta, Et Specierum Plantarum Editionis Secunda]] | location = Brunsvigae | publisher = Orphanotrophei}}</ref> The [[Binomial nomenclature#Authorship in scientific names|full name]] of the species is therefore "''Banksia integrifolia'' L.f."<ref name="APNI 53918">{{APNI | name = Banksia integrifolia L.f. | id = 53918}}</ref>

Then followed two centuries of uncertainty as to the taxonomic limits of ''B.&nbsp;integrifolia''. The first sign of confusion was in 1788, when [[Joseph Gaertner]] published ''B.&nbsp;spicata''.<ref name="Gaerner 1788">{{cite book | author = [[Joseph Gaertner|Gaertner, Joseph]] | title = De fructibus et seminibus plantarum | location = Stutgard | publisher = Sumtibus auctoris, typis academiae carolinae}}</ref>  Gaertner did not specify his type material for the taxon, but contemporary material labelled as such clearly belongs to what is now known as ''B.&nbsp;i.'' subsp.

(Proteaceae) | journal = Nuytsia | volume = 3 | issue = 3 | pages = 239–473 | id = {{ISSN|0085-4417}}}}</ref> In 1810, [[Robert Brown (botanist)|Robert Brown]] relegated the name to [[synonymy]] with ''B.&nbsp;integrifolia'',<ref name="R.Br. 1810">{{cite book | author = [[Robert Brown (botanist)|Brown, Robert]] | year = 1810 | title = Prodomus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van-Diemen | location = London | publisher = Richard Taylor and Company}}</ref> and it remained so until 1981 when [[Alex George]] refined it to a synonym of ''B.&nbsp;i.'' var. ''integrifolia''.<ref name="George 1981"/>

In 1800, [[Antonio José Cavanilles]] published a number of new ''Banksia'' species, based on specimens collected at [[Port Jackson]], New South Wales in 1797 by [[Luis Née]], botanist to the [[Alejandro Malaspina]] expedition. These included ''[[Banksia oblongifolia|B.&nbsp;oblongifolia]]'', ''B.&nbsp;oleifolia'' and ''B.&nbsp;glauca''. The last two of these were declared synonyms of ''B.&nbsp;integrifolia'' by [[Robert Brown (botanist)|Robert Brown]] in 1810,<ref name="R.Br. 1810"/> and refined to synonyms of ''B.&nbsp;i.'' subsp. ''integrifolia'' by George in 1999.<ref name="George 1999">{{cite encyclopedia | author = [[Alex George|Geogre, Alex S.]] | year = 1999 | title = Banksia | url = http://www.anbg.gov.au/abrs/online-resources/flora/stddisplay.xsql?pnid=3381 | accessdate = 2006-10-31 | editor = Wilson, Annette | encyclopedia = [http://www.deh.gov.au/biodiversity/abrs/online-resources/flora/main/index.html Flora of Australia] | volume = Volume 17B: Proteaceae 3: Hakea to Dryandra | pages = 175–251 | location = Collingwood, Victoria | publisher = CSIRO Publishing / Australian Biological Resources Study | id = ISBN 0-643-06454-0}}</ref> The first was ascribed to ''B.&nbsp;i.'' var.

In 1810, [[Robert Brown (botanist)|Robert Brown]] described 31 known species of ''Banksia'' in his ''[[Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen]]''. He split the genus into two subgenera, placing ''B.&nbsp;integrifolia'' in subgenus ''Banksia verae'', the "True Banksias".<ref name="R.Br. 1810"/> New species described by Brown included ''B.&nbsp;compar'', which is now considered a subspecies of ''B.&nbsp;integrifolia'',<ref name="APNI 127460">{{APNI | name = Banksia integrifolia subsp. compar (R.Br.) K.R.Thiele | id = 127460}}</ref> and ''[[Banksia paludosa|B.&nbsp;paludosa]]'', a close relative of ''B.&nbsp;integrifolia'' which was for a time considered a variety of it.<ref name="Bentham 1870">{{cite encyclopedia | author = [[George Bentham|Bentham, George]] | year = 1870 | title = [[Wikisource:Flora Australiensis/Volume V/CIV.

Reeve & Co.}}</ref>

By the time [[Carl Meissner]] published [[Meissner's taxonomic arrangement of Banksia|his 1856 arrangement]] of the genus, there were 58 described ''Banksia'' species. Meissner divided Brown's ''Banksia verae'', which had been renamed ''Eubanksia'' by [[Stephan Endlicher]] in 1847,<ref name="George 1981"/> into four series based on leaf properties. He placed ''B.&nbsp;integrifolia'' in series ''Salicinae'', and further divided it into three varieties: ''B.&nbsp;i.'' var. ''minor'' for specimens with small, entire leaves; ''B.&nbsp;i.'' var. ''major'' for specimens with larger, somewhat dentate leaves; and ''B.&nbsp;integrifola'' var ''dentata'' for specimens with very large dentate leaves.<ref>{{cite book | author = [[Carl Meissner|Meissner, Carl]] | year = 1856 | chapter = Proteaceae | editor = [[A. P. de Candolle]] | title = Prodromus systematis naturalis regni vegetabilis, pars decima quarta | url = http://www.botanicus.org/title.asp?barcode=31753003013338 | location = Paris | publisher = Sumptibus Victoris Masson}}</ref> However, the second of these varieties were based upon a specimen of ''B.&nbsp;integrifolia'' with juvenile leaves, and the last was ''[[Banksia robur|B.&nbsp;robur]]''. All three were overturned by George in 1981.<ref name="George 1981"/>

In 1870, [[George Bentham]] published a thorough revision of the ''Banksia'' in his landmark publication ''[[Flora Australiensis]]''. In [[Bentham's taxonomic arrangement of Banksia|Bentham's arrangement]], Meissner's four series were replaced by four sections based on leaf, style and [[pollen-presenter]] characters. ''B.&nbsp;integrifolia'' was placed in section ''Eubanksia'' along with ''[[Banksia marginata|B.&nbsp;marginata]]'' and ''[[Banksia dentata|B.&nbsp;dentata]]''. The number of recognised ''Banksia'' species was reduced from 58 to 46, with ''B.&nbsp;compar'' declared a synonym of ''B.&nbsp;integrifolia'', and ''B.&nbsp;paludosa'' relegated to a variety of ''B.&nbsp;integrifolia''.<ref name="Bentham 1870"/> The former taxon is now a considered a subspecies of ''B.&nbsp;integrifolia'', but ''B.&nbsp;paludosa'' has since been reinstated as a species and remains a current species name.<ref name="APNI 54772">{{APNI | name = Banksia paludosa R.Br. | id = 54772}}</ref>

A major disruption to ''Banksia'' nomenclature occurred in 1891, when [[Otto Kuntze]] attempted to have the ''Banksia'' genus renamed ''Sirmuellera'', on the grounds that ''Banksia'' J.R.Forst & G.Forst (referring to the genus now known as ''[[Pimelia]]'') was published before ''Banksia'' L.f., and therefore took precedence. Kuntze published new names for each of the ''Banksia'' species, renaming ''B.&nbsp;integrifolia'' to ''Sirmuellera integrifolia'' (L.f.) Kuntze.<ref name="Kuntze 1891">{{cite book | author = [[Otto Kuntze|Kuntze, Otto]] | year = 1891 | title = Revisio Generum Plantarum: Pars II | pages = 581–582 | location = Leipzig | publisher = Arthur Felix}}</ref> Kuntze's challenge failed, as did a similar challenge by [[James Britten]] in 1905. Britten proposed the generic name ''Isostylis'', republishing ''B.&nbsp;integrifolia'' as ''Isostylis integrifolia'' (L.f.) A.T.Lee. This challenge also failed, and in 1940 ''Banksia'' L.f. was formally conserved against future challenges.<ref name="George 1981"/>

In 1913, [[Frederick Bailey]] promoted Brown's ''B.&nbsp;compar'', which had been declared a synonym of ''B.&nbsp;integrifolia'' by Bentham in 1870, to variety rank as ''B.&nbsp;i.'' var. ''compar''. This would be the first infraspecific taxon of ''B.&nbsp;integrifolia'' to achieve widespread acceptance.<ref name="APNI 53939">{{APNI | name = Banksia integrifolia var. compar (R.Br.) F.M.Bailey | id = 53939}}</ref> The variety was promoted to subspecies rank by [[Kevin Thiele]] in 1994,<ref name="Thiele 1994">{{cite journal | author = [[Kevin Thiele|Thiele, Kevin]] and Pauline Ladiges | year = 1994 | title = The Banksia integrifolia L.f.

''compar'' remains a current taxon to date.<ref name="APNI 127460">{{APNI | name = Banksia integrifolia subsp. compar (R.Br.) K.R.Thiele | id = 127460}}</ref> Under modern botanical nomenclature rules, the publication of subspecies ''B.&nbsp;i.'' subsp. ''compar'' automatically published the [[autonym]] ''B.&nbsp;i.'' subsp. ''integrifolia'', to encompass the type material.

The current taxonomic treatment of ''Banksia'' first appeared in Alex George's classic 1981 monograph ''[[The Genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae)]]''. In addition to revising the existing nomenclature, George published a number of new species and subspecies. Among them was a new variety of ''B.&nbsp;integrifolia'', ''B.&nbsp;i.'' var. ''aquilonia''.<ref name="George 1981"/> This was promoted to subspecific rank by Thiele in 1994,<ref name="Thiele 1994"/> and in 1996 George promoted it to specific rank as ''[[Banksia aquilonia]]''.<ref name="George 1996">{{cite journal | author = [[Alex George|George, Alex S.]] | year = 1996 | title = Notes on Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae) | journal = Nuytsia | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 21–24}}</ref>

A third subspecific taxon of ''B.&nbsp;integrifolia'' has its roots in Gwen Harden's 1991 publication ''Flora of New South Wales''. Harden recognised a new subspecies of ''B. integrifolia'', but did not give it a name, referring to it only as "''B.&nbsp;i.'' subsp. A".<ref name="APNI 262570">{{APNI | name = Banksia integrifolia subsp. A | id = 262570}}</ref> In 1994, Thiele confirmed the subspecific rank of this taxon, naming it ''B.&nbsp;i.'' subsp. ''monticola''.<ref name="Thiele 1994"/>

==Placement within ''Banksia''==
[[Image:Banksia dentata follicle.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Whether ''[[Banksia dentata|B.&nbsp;dentata]]'' (pictured) is more closely allied to ''B.&nbsp;integrifolia'' or ''[[Banksia robur|B.&nbsp;robur]]'' is currently a bone of contention.]]
The currently accepted [[taxonomy|taxonomic]] arrangement for the ''Banksia'' genus is based on [[Alex George]]'s 1999 monograph for the ''[[Flora of Australia (series)|Flora of Australia]]'' book series.<ref name="George 1999"/> In this arrangement, ''B.&nbsp;integrifolia'' is placed in [[Banksia subg. Banksia|''Banksia'' subg. ''Banksia'']], because its [[inflorescence]]s take the form of ''Banksia''<div/>'s characteristic flower spikes; [[Banksia sect. Banksia|''Banksia'' sect. ''Banksia'']] because of its straight [[style]]s; and [[Banksia ser. Salicinae|''Banksia'' ser. ''Salicinae'']] because of its inflorescences are cylindrical.

''Salicinae'' is considered a well-defined series, and subsequent research supports George's placement of ''B.&nbsp;integrifolia'' within it. However, relationships within Salicinae are not yet settled. In 1996, Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges divided the series into two subseries: ''Banksia'' subser. ''Integrifoliae'' and ''Banksia'' subser. ''Acclives''.<ref name="Thiele 1996">{{cite journal | author = Thiele, Kevin and Pauline Ladiges | year = 1996 | title = A Cladistic Analysis of Banksia (Proteaceae) | journal = Australian Systematic Botany | issn = 1030-1887 | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = 661-733 | url = http://www.publish.csiro.au/?act=view_file&file_id=SB9960661.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2006-10-31}}</ref> The seven members of subseries ''Integrifoliae'' all appear to be closely related, and natural hybrids have been recorded between members where they co-occur. Molecular studies by Austin Mast also support this grouping.<ref name="Mast 2002">{{cite journal | first = Austin R. | last = Mast | coauthors = Thomas J.

''B.&nbsp;integrifolia''<div/>'s placement within ''Banksia'' may be summarised as follows:
:'''Genus ''[[Banksia]]'''''

==Subspecies and hybrids==
[[Image:Banksia integrifolia subsp. monticola inflorescence.jpg|thumb|Inflorescence of ''B.&nbsp;i.'' subsp. ''monticola'' in late bud.]]
''B.&nbsp;integrifolia'' is a highly variable species. Some of this variation can be attributed to environmental factors, but much appears to be genetic: George writes that it "gives the impression that it is actively speciating to fill the many ecological niches through its range".<ref name="George 1981"/> Three subspecies are currently recognised: [[Banksia integrifolia subsp. integrifolia|''B.&nbsp;i.'' subsp. ''integrifolia'']], [[Banksia integrifolia subsp. compar|''B.&nbsp;i.'' subsp. ''compar'']], and [[Banksia integrifolia subsp. monticola|''B.&nbsp;i.'' subsp. ''monticola'']].
