Punk initially came to prominence through his career on the professional wrestling [[independent circuit]], primarily as a member of the [[Ring of Honor]] (ROH) roster, where he was an [[ROH World Tag Team Championship|ROH Tag Team Champion]], [[ROH World Championship|ROH World Champion]], and the first head trainer of the [[Ring of Honor#ROH wrestling school|ROH wrestling school]]. In 2005, Punk signed a contract with WWE and was sent to its developmental federation, [[Ohio Valley Wrestling]] (OVW), where he won every championship available in the federation. 

When the [[Extreme Championship Wrestling (WWE)|ECW]] brand was revived, Punk was moved up to the main roster, where he established himself by being undefeated in singles competition for six months, followed by winning the [[ECW Championship]] a few months later. At [[WrestleMania XXIV]], Punk won the annual [[Money in the Bank ladder match]] (MITB) to earn a title shot at any world championship of his choosing. In the [[2008 WWE Draft]], Punk was moved from ECW to Raw, and in his first week on Raw, cashed in his MITB briefcase to face, and subsequently defeat, [[Adam Copeland|Edge]] for the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]].

Throughout his career, Punk has consistently used the [[List of professional wrestling terms#G|gimmick]] of being [[straight edge]], a lifestyle he follows in real life.<ref name="punkshoot">{{cite video|people=CM Punk|url=http://www.rfvideo.com/browseproducts/Shoot-with-CM-Punk.html|title=Shoot with CM Punk|medium=DVD|publisher=RF Video|month2=November|year2=2003|accessdate=2007-04-14}}</ref> Depending on alignment as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|crowd favorite]] or [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villain]], different aspects of the culture are emphasized to encourage the desired audience [[Heat (professional wrestling)|reaction]].<ref name="punkshoot" />

==Career==
===Early career===
[[Image:Punkindependent.jpg|thumb|150px|CM Punk in a match against Danny Dominion at an [[NWA Midwest]] event on November 23, 2002 in [[Grayslake, Illinois]].]]
Punk's first venture into wrestling was a stint in a [[backyard wrestling]] federation called the Lunatic Wrestling Federation with his friends and brother Mike Broox in the mid-late 1990s. He first started using the [[ring name]] CM Punk when he was put into a [[tag team]] named the Chick Magnets with CM Venom after another performer skipped out on the [[Card_(professional_wrestling)#C|card]].<ref name="punkshoot" /><ref name="chickmagnets">{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20040222144349/http://www.chicagowrestling.com/AL/al-cmvenom-12-17-01.htm|title=CM Venom Interview|accessdate=2006-09-26|author=Lagattolla, Al|date=2001-12-17|publisher=Chicago Wrestling}}</ref><ref name="jon">{{cite web|url=http://sports.ign.com/articles/748/748635p1.html|title=CM Punk Interview|accessdate=2007-03-19|author=Robinson, Jon|date=2006-12-01|publisher=IGN}}</ref> Unlike his friends, Punk genuinely wanted to be a wrestler and saw it as more than simple fun.<ref name="punkshoot" /> 

When the promotion started taking off, doing spot shows out of a warehouse in [[Mokena, Illinois]] Punk found out that his brother Mike had embezzled thousands of dollars from the small company, causing them to become estranged. Mike hasn't wrestled since.<ref name="punkbio">{{cite web|url=http://wrestlingtruth.com/wrestling-bios/cm-punk/|title=CM Punk Bio|accessdate=2008-11-20|author=Balderson, Keelan|publisher=Wrestling Truth}}</ref>

He soon left the federation and enrolled as a student at the "Steel Domain" [[wrestling school]] in Chicago, where he was trained by Ace Steel ([[Ace Steel|Chris Guy]]),<ref name="acesteel" /> Danny Dominion and Kevin Quinn to become a professional wrestler. As part of the training, he wrestled at Steel Domain Wrestling in St. Paul, Minnesota.<ref name="punkshoot" /><ref name="wojick">{{cite web|url=http://wrestlingclothesline.com/Wojcik-Punk.htm|title=Wojick Interview|accessdate=2006-09-26|author=Wojick, Alan|date=2003-06-21|publisher=The Wrestling Clothesline}}</ref> It was in the Steel Domain that he met [[Scott Colton]],<ref name="punkcabana" /><ref name="joepunk">{{cite video|people=CM Punk; [[Samoa Joe]]|url=http://www.rohwrestling.com/shoponline.asp?point=moreinfo&catid=200&id=1220|title=Straight Shootin' with Samoa Joe & CM Punk|medium=DVD|publisher=Ring of Honor|date2=2005-03-10|accessdate=2007-04-14}}</ref> who soon adopted the stage name [[Colt Cabana]]. Punk and Cabana became best friends and spent most of their early career together working in the same [[Independent circuit|independent promotions]], as opponents or allies.<ref name="punkcabana">{{cite video|people=CM Punk; Colt Cabana|url=http://www.rohwrestling.com/shoponline.asp?point=moreinfo&catid=200&id=1397|title=Straight Shootin' with CM Punk & Colt Cabana|medium=DVD|publisher=Ring of Honor|date2=2005-07-01|accessdate=2007-04-14}}</ref> In the independents, Punk, along with fellow Steel Domain graduates Colt Cabana, Chuckee Smooth, [[Adam Pearce]] and manager [[Dave Prazak]], formed a [[Stable (professional wrestling)|stable]] named the Gold Bond Mafia.<ref name="punkshoot" />

Punk's home [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] for his early career is usually considered to be [[Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South|Independent Wrestling Association: Mid-South]] (IWA:Mid-South).<ref name="punkshoot" /> During Punk's time in IWA:Mid-South, he had high profile feuds with Colt Cabana and [[Chris Hero]] while also rising to the top of the roster winning the [[IWA Mid-South Light Heavyweight Championship]] twice and the [[IWA Mid-South Heavyweight Championship]] on five separate occasions. Punk's feud with Hero included a 55-minute [[Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match|TLC match]],<ref name="punkshoot" /> a 93-minute [[two out of three falls match]],<ref name="wojick" /> and several 60-minute time limit draws.<ref name="joepunk" />

Punk's matches with Cabana led him to being hired by the [[Ring of Honor]] promotion.<ref name="wojick" /> During his time in IWA:Mid-South, he would also meet, wrestle against and become a friend of [[Eddie Guerrero]].<ref name="punkshoot" /><ref name="wojick" /> From February 2003 until May 2004, Punk refused to wrestle for IWA:Mid-South. Punk claims that this was in protest to [[Ian Rotten]]'s mistreatment of Chris Hero in the company<ref name="punkshoot" />; however, Hero has stated he believes there were other reasons, and Rotten's treatment of him was just an excuse by Punk to stop working for the company.<ref name="heroshoot">{{cite video|people=[[Chris Hero]]|url=http://www.rfvideo.com/index.asp?PageAction=VIEWPROD&ProdID=2708|title=Shoot with Chris Hero|medium=DVD|publisher=RF Video|year =2005|accessdate=2007-04-14}}</ref> Eventually Punk returned to IWA:Mid-South and continued to perform as a wrestler and commentator for them until 2005 when he was signed to World Wrestling Entertainment. His last appearance in IWA:Mid-South was on July 2, 2005 in which he competed in a 60-minute time limit draw against [[Delirious (wrestler)|Delirious]].

Initially, Punk joined [[Ring of Honor]] (ROH) as a crowd favorite,<ref name="punkshoot" /> but quickly became a villain in a feud with [[Scott Levy|Raven]] that featured numerous variants of [[Professional wrestling match types#No Disqualification match|no disqualification matches]]. At the same time, Punk joined the wrestling promotion [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling|NWA Total Nonstop Action]] (TNA), in which he was paired with [[Brian Wohl|Julio Dinero]] as members of Raven's TNA [[Stable (professional wrestling)|stable]] [[Raven's Nest#The Gathering|The Gathering]].<ref name="punkshoot" />

Punk started climbing the ranks of ROH, with notable achievements including coming<!-- in? placing?--> second at the ''Second Anniversary Show'' during the tournament to crown the first [[ROH Pure Championship|ROH Pure Champion]], losing to [[A.J. Styles]] in the finals, and winning the [[ROH World Tag Team Championship|ROH Tag Team Championship]] twice with Colt Cabana as the [[Second City Saints]].

Shortly before a TNA show on February 25, 2004, Punk had a physical scuffle with [[Teddy Hart]] outside of a restaurant that was broken up by [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]]. The scuffle reportedly stemmed from an ROH show in which Hart performed [[Teddy Hart#Ring of Honor|three unplanned spots]] putting several other wrestlers in danger of injury.<ref name="teddyhartlj">{{cite web|url=http://cmpunk.livejournal.com/2003/11/12/|title=My turn...|accessdate=13 July|accessyear=2007|author=CM Punk|date=2003-11-12|publisher=LiveJournal}}</ref><ref name="shootteddyhart">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlingobserver.com/wo/news/headlines/default.asp?aID=15350|title=Derek Burgan reviews Best of Teddy Hart & Jack Evans|accessdate=2007-06-13|author=Burgan, Derek|date=2006-01-28|format=asp|publisher=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|quote=The interviewer immediately asked Teddy about the situation with CM Punk.

In ROH, Punk faced off against [[ROH World Championship|ROH World Champion]] [[Samoa Joe]] for the championship in a three-match series. The first match, on June 12, 2004 at ''World Title Classic'' in Dayton, Ohio, resulted in a 60-minute time-limit draw when neither Punk nor Joe could pin or cause the other to submit in the 60 minutes. The second match between Punk and Joe was planned for December 4, 2004; however, due to [[Steve Corino]] being pulled from a match with Joe by [[Pro Wrestling ZERO1-MAX|Pro Wrestling ZERO-ONE]], the second match was hastily rescheduled on October 11, 2004 for October 16 in Punk's hometown of Chicago.<ref name="joepunk" /> At ''Joe vs. Punk II'' on October 16, they wrestled to a second 60-minute draw. In addition to ''Joe vs. Punk II'' becoming Ring of Honor's best-selling DVD at the time, the match received a [[Dave Meltzer#Rating system|five-star rating]] by [[Dave Meltzer]]'s ''[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]''. It was the first match in North America to receive a five-star rating in seven years—the last one being the [[Hell in a Cell]] match between [[Shawn Michaels]] and [[The Undertaker]] at [[Badd Blood#1997|Badd Blood 1997]].<ref name="joepunk" /> Joe ended the series by defeating Punk in the third and final match on December 4, 2004 at ''All-Star Extravaganza 2'' in which there was a no time limit stipulation.

In June 2005, Punk accepted a deal with [[World Wrestling Entertainment]], after a try-out match against [[Sean Morley|Val Venis]] on its ''[[WWE Heat|Sunday Night HEAT]]'' show. Even though he had accepted the deal, Punk went on to defeat [[Austin Aries]] with his [[Facebuster#Double underhook facebuster|Pepsi Plunge]] move, winning the [[ROH World Championship]] on June 18, 2005 at ''Death Before Dishonor III''.<ref name=ROH/>

Immediately after the match, Punk proceeded to become a villain and started a storyline where he threatened to bring the ROH World Championship to WWE with him. For weeks, Punk teased the ROH locker room and the ROH fans as well as mocking the championship he possessed, going so far as to sign his WWE contract on it. During the storyline, [[Mick Foley]] made several ROH appearances, attempting to convince Punk to do the right thing and defend the title on his way out.

On August 12, 2005 in Dayton, Ohio, Punk lost the ROH World Championship to [[Jamie Noble|James Gibson]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|four corner elimination match]] consisting of himself, Gibson, [[Samoa Joe]] and [[Christopher Daniels]], who re-debuted after a year-and-half absence. Gibson countered Punk's Pepsi Plunge with a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Super|Super]] [[Powerbomb#Double underhook powerbomb|Tiger Bomb]]. Punk's final scheduled match in Ring of Honor took place at ''Punk: The Final Chapter'' on August 13, 2005 against long-time friend Colt Cabana in a [[Professional wrestling match types#two out of three falls|2 out of 3 falls match]], which he lost.<ref name=ROH/> In his last match, Punk was visibly crying and was showered with streamers when he posed in the middle of the ring.

Punk made a special appearance at the ROH show ''Unscripted II'' on February 11, 2006, when the original card had to be scrapped due to [[Brandon Silvestry|Low Ki]] leaving ROH the week prior. In addition, most of the ROH roster contracted to TNA were pulled from the show because of a snowstorm that TNA officials thought might prevent performers from reaching [[TNA Against All Odds#2006|a pay-per-view]] scheduled the next day.<ref name="unscripted1">{{cite web

===World Wrestling Entertainment===
====Ohio Valley Wrestling (2005–2006)====
In 2005<!-- Exact date/month preferred -->, Punk was assigned to [[Ohio Valley Wrestling]] (OVW), a WWE developmental territory. On September 26, 2005 in his OVW television debut, Punk suffered a ruptured eardrum and broken nose after Danny Inferno hit him with an [[Botch (professional wrestling)|overly]] [[Stiff (professional wrestling)|stiff]] [[Punch (strike)|right hand]]. Despite the injury, Punk finished the match and quickly recovered.<ref name="ovwresults05">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/ovw/_2005/|title=Ohio Valley Wrestling - 2005 Results|accessdate=2006-07-30|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref><ref name="lordsofpaininjury">{{cite web|url=http://www.lordsofpain.net/news/2005_/articles/1126805425.php|title=Latest on released WWE wrestler, Ken Kennedy, CM Punk injury|accessdate=2006-09-26|author=Cantor, Brian|date=2005-09-15|format=php|publisher=Lords of Pain}}</ref>

On November 9, 2005, Punk became the [[OVW Television Championship|OVW Television Champion]] after defeating [[Ken Doane]].<ref name="ovwresults05"/> This led immediately to a feud between Punk and [[Brent Albright]], who had previously been feuding with Doane for the television championship and had lost his chance to wrestle Doane after Punk hit him with a chair so he himself could wrestle Doane. This led to a series of matches, including one that ended in overtime with Albright having Punk submit to Albright's [[List_of_professional_wrestling_terms#F|finisher]], the [[Professional wrestling holds#Fujiwara armbar|Crowbar]], but Punk was able to keep the championship, as he had not agreed to the extra time.<ref name="ovwresults05"/> 

On January 4, 2006, Punk lost the OVW Television Championship during a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|three way dance]] among himself, Albright and Doane. Doane was injured halfway through the match and was replaced by [[Aaron Stevens (wrestler)|Aaron "The Idol" Stevens]]. Punk submitted to Albright's Crowbar and was eliminated, but returned later in the match to distract Albright allowing Stevens to [[Pinfall (professional wrestling)|pin]] Albright and become the new OVW Television Champion.<ref name="ovwresults06">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/ovw/_2006/|title=Ohio Valley Wrestling - 2006 Results|accessdate=2006-07-30|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> The feud continued after a short period in which Albright and Punk were a tag team, but they became opponents again after Albright wanted the respect of Punk, who would never give it to him, and instead proceeded to "punk out" (get the better of) Albright repeatedly. This continued for weeks with Punk always getting the better of Albright until a [[List_of_professional_wrestling_terms#D|double turn]] occurred on February 1, 2006 when Albright became a villain during a tag match, allowing the [[Spirit Squad]] to beat Punk and, in doing so, making Punk a crowd favorite.<ref name="ovwresults06"/> During this time, Punk had a minor appearance at [[WrestleMania 22]] on April 2, 2006 as one of the [[gangster]]s who rode a 1930s era car to the ring before [[John Cena]]'s entrance.<ref name="wmgangster">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/pictures/c/cmpunk/19.jpg|title = 19.jpg|accessdate=2006-09-26|date=2006-04-02|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|quote=CM Punk as a gangster during [[John Cena]]'s entrance}}</ref>

On May 3, 2006, Punk finally defeated Brent Albright in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Texas Bullrope Match|strap match]] to win the OVW Heavyweight Championship.<ref name="ovwresults06"/> As champion, Punk retained the title in matches against opponents such as [[Shad Gaspard]],<ref name="ovwresults06"/> [[Mr. Kennedy|Ken Kennedy]],<ref name="ovwresults06"/> [[Johnny Jeter]]<ref name="ovwresults06"/> and [[Mike Mizanin|Mike "The Miz" Mizanin]].<ref name="punkvsmiz">{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070629175121/http://pwtorch.com/artman/publish/article_17333.shtml|title=7/15 OVW in Cordyon, Ind.: C.M.

This led to a feud between Punk and Skyfire after a rematch for the Tag Team Championship on August 7, 2006 in which a healthy Punk purposefully tagged in an injured Skyfire to be beaten by Shade and Compton.<ref name="ovwresults06"/> On August 30, 2006, a match was scheduled to take place between Punk and Skyfire for the OVW Heavyweight Championship. Prior to the match, however, Skyfire was attacked by Charles "The Hammer" Evans, with whom Skyfire had also been feuding, and was replaced in the match by Chet Jablonski (Chet the Jet) who pinned Punk to win the OVW Heavyweight Championship.<ref name="ovwresults06"/> As Punk no longer possessed the championship, OVW no longer required him. He was removed from the roster and brought up to the WWE roster full time. He continued to make sporadic appearances for the company, such as at the 400th episode of OVW on television,<ref name="ovwresults06"/> up until WWE announced it was ending its developmental territory agreement with OVW.<!-- Date needed -->

==Gimmick==
[[Image:Punk and fan.jpg|thumb|205px|CM Punk with a fan at a [[Puerto Rico]] house show.]]
Punk has adopted his real-life following of the [[straight edge]] movement as his professional wrestling [[List of professional wrestling terms#G|gimmick]], but the gimmick uses different elements of Punk's personality and the beliefs of the straight edge movement depending on his [[List of professional wrestling terms#A|alignment]]. While portraying a crowd favorite, the gimmick tends to be that of Punk's normal personality,<ref name="punkshoot" /> largely indifferent to others who drink [[alcohol]], smoke [[tobacco]], partake in [[recreational drug use]] or have [[promiscuity|promiscuous]] [[human sexual behavior|sexual behavior]], but emphasizing the social discipline involved with [[abstinence]]. Conversely, his villainous personality tends to be that of one who is [[Hardline (subculture)|hardline]], exemplifying the elitist attitudes and superiority complexes—defined by Punk's common mantra during villainous-themed [[Promo (professional wrestling)|promos]] that, because he is straight edge, he is "better than you".<ref name="punkshoot" /> Regardless of alignment, Punk performs the straight edge symbol of crossing his arms in an X formation while having the letter X written on the back of his hands, usually drawn on his wrist tape.

A common question about Punk's gimmick, and one that comes up often with fans, is the meaning of the [[initialism]] CM. Originally the CM represented the phrase "Chick Magnet", the name of the tag team he was in as a [[backyard wrestler]].<ref name="punkshoot" /><ref name="jon" /> Punk, however, later changed CM into an [[pseudo-acronym|orphan acronym]], declaring that it has no meaning.<ref name="wojick" /> Although Punk has stated CM now has no real meaning, when asked he has taken to making up meanings that fit the initials, going so far as to make up long stories to explain the origins that do not match the actual origin story at all.<ref name="wojick" /> Since beginning this practice, Punk has stated CM stands for "[[Cookie Monster]]",<ref name="WWEuncut">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/content/media/video/vms/wweuncut/2007/may29-31/4775196|title=WWE UnCut: CM Punk | accessdate=2007-06-12|date=2007-05-29 | publisher=WWE}}</ref> "Cookie Master",<ref name="The Mississauga News">{{cite web|url=http://mississauganews.com/article/8991|title=Sport Heroes takes on AIDS|publisher=The Mississauga News}}</ref> "[[#In wrestling|Crooked Moonsault]]",<ref name="cagematchde">{{cite web|url=http://www.cagematch.de/?id=2&nr=00000080|title=Datenbank Profil - CM Punk|accessdate=2006-09-26|publisher=Cagematch.de|language=German}}</ref> "[[Chuck Mosley]]",<ref name="cagematchde" /> "[[Montgomery Burns|Charles Montgomery]]"<ref name="jon" />, "[[Charles Manson]]",<ref name="jon" />, "Crazy Mariachi", "Chicago Made"  <ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/videogames/news/story?id=3681125/CM Punk talks to ESPN]</ref> and "Championship Material", among others.

An integral part of Punk's gimmick are the numerous [[tattoo]]s that adorn his body, some of which have come to become symbols associated with Punk, as well as [[mantra]]s and declarations that have been integrated into his gimmick. The tattoos as a whole, due to their large quantity and variety, have also become an attribute identifiable to Punk.<ref name="wwemag" /> The most important of the individual tattoos in Punk's character, whether through association, symbol, or mantra, are: 

*A [[Pepsi-Cola|Pepsi]] logo on his left shoulder that inspired the names of two of his [[#In wrestling|signature moves]]. It also became a symbol of Punk himself, who wore the logo on his ring gear in the independent circuit, as well as a slightly modified Pepsi logo being used as part of his [[Jumbotron|TitanTron]] entrance video.<ref name="tron">{{cite video|people=CM Punk|year=2006|title=Entrance video|url=http://www.wwe.com/content/media/video/tvshows/ecw/entrance_videos/0724cmpunkentvid|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment}}</ref> He got the tattoo as a joke, as many [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] members in his school were getting beer logos tattooed on their bodies. Punk, a keen Pepsi drinker, chose to receive a Pepsi tattoo to emphasize his straight edge beliefs.<ref name="wojick" /> The tattoo is also a reference to former [[Minor Threat]] guitarist [[Brian Baker (musician)|Brian Baker]], who had a [[Coca-Cola]] tattoo and explained this by saying "I like Coca-Cola". When people inquire about Punk's Pepsi tattoo, he often replies "I like Pepsi" in a similar fashion.<ref name="punkshoot" />
*The words "Straight Edge" are spelled out on Punk's stomach. This tattoo is one of his oldest tattoos,<ref name="wwemag">{{cite journal|author=CM Punk|year=2006|month=October|title=The Illustrated Man|journal=WWE Magazine|pages=13}}</ref> he has referred to it as his identity.<ref name="cheesegrater">{{cite video|people=CM Punk|url=http://www.rohwrestling.com/shoponline.asp?point=moreinfo&catid=&id=1125&pRange=0&iCurrentPage=1|title=Best Of American Super Juniors Tournament|medium=DVD|publisher=Ring of Honor|date =2005-04-02|accessdate=2007-04-14}}</ref>
*A [[sleeve tattoo]] on his left arm that reads "luck is for losers", a mantra used on some of the choices for Punk's first [[Extreme Championship Wrestling (WWE)|ECW]] [[T-shirt]],<ref name="shirt">{{cite web|url=http://punk-wrestling.com/coppermine/thumbnails.php?album=1|title=ECW T-Shirt Designs|accessdaymonth=2 October|accessyear=2006|format=php|publisher=Punk-Wrestling}}</ref>{{Dead link|date=May 2008}} that features numerous [[good luck]] symbols, including a [[rabbit's foot]], [[four-leaf clover]] and a [[horseshoe]].<ref name="wweink">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/superstarink/articles/cmpunk|title=Punk's got a lucky arm|accessdate=2007-10-18|date=2007-10-18|publisher=WWE}}</ref> The tattoo also features four [[ace]] playing cards as a tribute to trainer [[Ace Steel]].<ref name="wweink" />
*A tattoo on the back of his left hand reading "No gimmicks needed", a tribute to deceased wrestler [[Chris Candido]].<ref name="PS155">{{Citation|last=Martin|first=Fin|title=What's Going Down.|newspaper=[[Power Slam]]|issue=155|pages=4|date=June 2007}}</ref>

Punk's character and gimmick have been parodied by the wrestling federation [[Chikara (professional wrestling)|CHIKARA]] with the [[mascot]] character [[Necro Butcher|CP Munk]], the straight edge [[chipmunk]]. The character includes references to Punk, such as X-marked wrist tape, a Pepsi logo on the costume's left shoulder, and a high-pitch version of Punk's best-known independent circuit theme song "Miseria Cantare - The Beginning", by the band [[AFI (band)|AFI]].<ref name="cpmunk2">{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070629175121/http://pwtorch.com/artman/exec/view.cgi/24/15028|title=Tape review: Chikara, "Negative Balance," Aug. 13, w/Hero-Kingston, Claudio-Quack, Cannon-Reckless|accessdate=2006-10-16|author=Vetter, Chris|date=2005-10-04|format=cgi|publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch|quote=CP Munk is a wrestler in a chipmunk costume, like a school mascot outfit. He has a Pepsi tattoo on his arm, he wears basketball trunks, and he came out to an AFI song… good comedy, and the crowd all knew this was a fun parody of CM Punk.}}</ref> On his website, Punk has said about the character CP Munk, and the people behind it:
{{cquote|I'm split 50/50 on it. Some days I get real pissed about it, because it's disrespectful. I'm sure it's no secret that the dorks that run Chikara and I don't get along, so they're [''sic''] judgement on trying to "mock" me is a little off. Most other days I just laugh it off because nobody from Chikara will ever be over enough anywhere for anybody else to parody them.<ref name="cpmunk3">{{cite web|url=http://cmpunk.com/askpunk.php|title=Ask Punk|accessdate=2007-12-13|format=php|publisher=CMPunk.com}}</ref>}}

==Personal life==
Phil Brooks was born in [[Chicago, Illinois]] on October 26, 1978 and was raised by his mother and father with two younger sisters and a brother named Mike.<ref name="joepunk" /> Mike was also a professional wrestler under the [[ring name]] Mike Broox<ref name="chickmagnets" /><ref name="cagematchde" />; however, Phil and Mike had a falling out after Mike embezzled several thousand dollars from the Lunatic Wrestling Federation.<ref name="mikebrooks">{{cite web|url=http://members5.boardhost.com/wrestlingnews/msg/62.html|title=CM PUNK INTERVIEW - Part 2|accessdate=2006-09-26|author=Lagattolla, Al|date=2001-05-28}}</ref> Phil first wished to pursue a career in professional wrestling after watching [[Roddy Piper]] crack a coconut over [[Jimmy Snuka]]'s head during an edition of the ''[[Piper's Pit]]''.<ref name="punkshoot" /><ref name="punkcabana" /><!-- When? --> 

While watching his father, who was a long-time [[alcoholic]] but eventually quit,<ref name="punkshoot" /><ref name="wwemag" /><ref name="jon" /> and reading that alcoholism may be hereditary, Brooks made a commitment to abstain from alcohol consumption to prevent the possibility from it ever occurring in his life.<ref name="punkshoot" /> During high school, Brooks discovered the [[hardcore punk]] music genre, most importantly the band [[Minor Threat]], who inspired the [[straight edge]] movement. After learning of the culture and its ideals and realizing it matched his own, he declared himself to be straight edge and started endorsing the philosophies of the movement.<ref name="punkshoot" /> 

After high school, Brooks moved out of the family house and lived for a time with fellow professional wrestler [[Cathy Corino]].<ref name="punkshoot" /> He later moved into an apartment with his trainer [[Ace Steel|Chris Guy]],<ref name="joepunk" /> but since then, Brooks has made reference to living alone in Chicago. Brooks worked other jobs to support himself during his early wrestling career, the last of which was as a laboratory technician for [[Underwriters Laboratories]] until he was fired due to poor conduct and work ethic in October 2002.<ref name="punkshoot" />

Brooks has made reference to two girlfriends in his early life.<ref name="punkshoot" /><ref name="punkcabana" /> During his time with [[Ring of Honor|ROH]], he was romantically linked to professional wrestlers [[Shannon Spruill]]<ref name="daffneyrajahrecap">{{cite web|url=http://rajah.com/base/node/3899|title=Mick Foley Discusses WWE Return & Flair, Daffney Discusses TNA & Diva Search|accessdate=2006-09-27|author=Cash, Chris|coauthors=Walk, Henry|date=2005-11-12|publisher=Rajah|quote=On the topic of CM Punk and their relationship, she said that the break-up was partially contributed to the two never being able to see each other (her in Louisville and him in Philly).}}</ref> and [[Tracy Brookshaw]].<ref name="joepunk" /> After joining [[Ohio Valley Wrestling|OVW]], Brooks began dating [[Maria Kanellis]], who was working at OVW as an interviewer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/raw/cmpunk/punkblogarchives/cmblog010907|author=CM Punk|title=Who's Jennifer?|accessdate=2007-01-09|date=2007-01-09}}</ref><ref name="thesun">{{cite web|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/wrestling/article53541.ece|title=Maria: I'm just one big fan|accessdate=2006-08-01|author=The Lilsboys|date=2006-06-03|publisher=The Sun}}</ref> They broke up sometime after Brooks was moved to [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] and started working on the [[Extreme Championship Wrestling (WWE)|ECW]] brand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/wrestling/article346976.ece|author=Rob McNichol|publisher=The Sun|title=Maria: I’ve split from CM Punk|accessdate=2007-10-16|date=2007-10-16}}</ref>

==Non-wrestling television appearances==
Brooks made an appearance on the February 16, 2004 episode of ''[[Monster Garage]]'', "Box Truck Wrestling Car", performing a short match with [[Samoa Joe|Joe Seanoa]] (Samoa Joe).<ref name="ihsjt">{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070629175121/http://pwtorch.com/artman/exec/view.cgi/24/14286|title=Interview Highlights: Samoa Joe talks about his decision to sign with TNA, his future|accessdate=2006-11-08|date=2005-08-01|publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch}}</ref> 

On October 31, 2006, Brooks joined [[The Atlantic Paranormal Society]] (TAPS) to shoot the [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]] special ''[[Ghost Hunters#Specials|Ghost Hunters Live]]'', which was a six-hour show broadcast live [[Halloween]] night from the [[Stanley Hotel]] in [[Estes Park]], [[Colorado]]. Initially skeptical about what he might find, Brooks claimed to have heard children giggling and footsteps when there were not any children booked into the hotel.<ref name="cpggh">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/news/archive/3557278|title=CM Punk goes ghost hunting|accessdate=2006-11-04|author=Medalis, Kara A.|date=2006-10-30|publisher=WWE}}</ref>
