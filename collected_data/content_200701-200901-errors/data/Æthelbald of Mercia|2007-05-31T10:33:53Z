'''Æthelbald''' (also spelled '''Ethelbald''', or '''Aethelbald''')<ref>The spelling "Æthelbald" uses the [[Old_English_language#Standardised_orthography|Anglo-Saxon alphabet]], and so can be considered the most authentic; however, it has occasionally been modernized in secondary sources to "Ethelbald" or "Aethelbald".</ref> (died 757) was the [[List of monarchs of Mercia|King]] of [[Mercia]] in [[England]] from 716 until 757.  During his long reign, Mercia, in what is now the [[England|English]] midlands, became the dominant kingdom of the Anglo-Saxons, recovering the position of pre-eminence it had enjoyed during the seventh century under the strong Mercian kings [[Penda of Mercia|Penda]] and [[Wulfhere of Mercia|Wulfhere]].  Mercian domination of England continued till the end of the eighth century: [[Offa of Mercia|Offa]], the grandson of Æthelbald's cousin Eanwulf, ruled for an additional thirty-nine years, starting shortly after Æthelbald's death.

Æthelbald came to the throne on the death of his cousin, King [[Ceolred of Mercia|Ceolred]].  Both [[Wessex]] and [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]] were ruled by strong kings at that time, but within fifteen years the contemporary chronicler [[Bede]] describes Æthelbald as ruling all England south of the river [[Humber]]. The [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]] does not list Æthelbald as a [[bretwalda]], or "Ruler of Britain", though this may be due to the West Saxon origin of the Chronicle.

[[Saint Boniface|St Boniface]] wrote to Æthelbald in about 745, reproving him for various dissolute and irreligious acts.  The subsequent council at Clovesho, in 747, and a charter Æthelbald issued at Gumley in 749, which freed the church from some obligations, may have been responses to Boniface's letter. Æthelbald was killed in 757 by his bodyguards.  He was succeeded briefly by [[Beornrad of Mercia|Beornrad]], of whom little is known, but within a year Offa had taken the throne.

==Early life and accession==
Æthelbald had Mercian royal blood, although his father, Alweo, was never king.  Alweo's father, [[Eowa of Mercia|Eowa]], was apparently king of Mercia from perhaps 634 to 642, though there is some confusion over differing accounts, and Eowa may have actually been one of two co-rulers of Mercia, sharing the throne with his brother, [[Penda of Mercia|Penda]].<ref name=Kirby_91>{{cite book |last= Kirby|first= D.P.|title= The Earliest English Kings|pages=91|year= 1992|publisher= Routledge|isbn=0-415-09086-5}}</ref> During Æthelbald's youth, Penda's dynasty ruled Mercia; [[Ceolred of Mercia|Ceolred]], a grandson of Penda and therefore a second cousin of Æthelbald, was king of Mercia from 709 to 716.<ref name=Kirby_227>See the genealogy in figure 8 of the appendix, in {{cite book |last= Kirby|first= D.P.|title= The Earliest English Kings|pages=227|year= 1992|publisher= Routledge|isbn=0-415-09086-5}}</ref>  An early source, Felix's ''Life of Saint Guthlac'', tells us that it was Ceolred who drove Æthelbald into exile.<ref name=Kirby_129>{{cite book |last= Kirby|first= D.P.|title= The Earliest English Kings|pages=129|year= 1992|publisher= Routledge|isbn=0-415-09086-5}}</ref> [[Saint Guthlac|Guthlac]] was a Mercian nobleman who abandoned a career of violence to become first a monk at [[Repton]], and then a hermit, living in a [[tumulus|barrow]] at [[Crowland]], in the East Anglian fens.<ref name=Campbell_82>{{cite book |last= Campbell|first= John|coauthors= John, Eric & Wormald, Patrick|title= The Anglo-Saxons|pages=82|year= 1991|publisher= Penguin Books|isbn=0-14-014395-5}}</ref>  During Æthelbald's exile he and his men also took refuge in the Fens in the area, and visited Guthlac.<ref name=Kirby_129 />  Guthlac was sympathetic to Æthelbald's cause, perhaps because of Ceolred's oppression of the monasteries.<ref name=Stenton_203>{{cite book |last= Stenton|first= Frank M.|title= Anglo-Saxon England|pages=203|year= 1971|publisher= Clarendon Press|isbn=0-19-821716-1}}</ref>   Other visitors of Guthlac's included Bishop Haedde of [[Lichfield]], an influential Mercian, and it may be that Guthlac's support was politically useful to Æthelbald in gaining the throne.  After Guthlac's death, Æthelbald had a dream in which Guthlac prophesied greatness for him, and Æthelbald later rewarded Guthlac with a shrine when he had become king.<ref name=Kirby_129 /><ref name=Campbell_94>{{cite book |last= Campbell|first= John|coauthors= John, Eric & Wormald, Patrick|title= The Anglo-Saxons|pages=94|year= 1991|publisher= Penguin Books|isbn=0-14-014395-5}}</ref>

==Mercian dominance==
[[Image:British seventh century kingdoms.gif|thumb|right|200px|The kingdoms of Britain in the late seventh century, when Æthelbald was born.]]Æthelbald's reign marked a resurgence of Mercian power, which would last till the end of the eighth century.<ref name=BlairRBaEE_168>{{cite book |last= Hunter Blair|first= Peter|title= Roman Britain and Early England: 55 B.C. - A.D. 871|pages=168|year= 1966|publisher= W.W. Norton & Company|isbn=0-393-00361-2}}</ref>  With the exception of the short reign of [[Beornrad]], who succeeded Æthelbald for less than a year, Mercia was ruled for eighty years by two of the most powerful Anglo-Saxon kings, Æthelbald and Offa.<ref name=Swanton_46>Beornrad was "put to flight" by Offa in one version of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle; according to another, he held the kingdom for "a little while, and unhappily".  {{cite book |last= Swanton|first= Michael|title= The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle|pages=46–50|year= 1996|publisher= Routledge|isbn=0-415-92129-5}}</ref>  These long reigns are surprising at this early date: during the same period there were eleven kings in [[Northumbria]], many of them dying violent deaths.<ref name=BlairAITASE_52>{{cite book |last= Hunter Blair|first= Peter|title= An Introduction to Anglo-Saxon England|pages=755|year= 1960|publisher= Cambridge University Press}}</ref>

By 731, Æthelbald had all the English south of the Humber under his overlordship.<ref name=Bede_PC_324>Translation by Leo Sherley-Price in {{cite book |last= Bede|title= Ecclesiastical History of the English People with Bede's Letter to Egbert and Cuthbert's Letter on the Death of Bede|pages=324|year= 1990|publisher= Penguin Books|isbn=0-14-0444565-X}}</ref>  Enough information survives to suggest the course of events for two of the southern kingdoms, [[Wessex]] and [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]].  At the start of Æthelbald's reign, both Kent and Wessex were ruled by strong kings; [[Wihtred of Kent|Wihtred]] and [[Ine of Wessex|Ine]], respectively.  Wihtred of Kent died in 725, and Ine of Wessex, one of the most formidable rulers of his day, abdicated in 726 to go on a pilgrimage to Rome.  According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Ine's successor, [[Aethelheard of Wessex|Aethelheard]], fought that year with an [[ealdorman]] named Oswald, whom the Chronicle provides with a genealogy showing descent from [[Ceawlin of Wessex|Ceawlin]], an early king of Wessex.<ref name=Swanton_42>{{cite book |last= Swanton|first= Michael|title= The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle|pages=42–43|year= 1996|publisher= Routledge|isbn=0-415-92129-5}}</ref> Aethelheard ultimately succeeded in this struggle for the throne, and there are subsequent indications that he ruled subject to Mercian authority.  Hence it may be that Æthelbald helped establish both Aethelheard and his brother, Cuthred, who succeeded Aethelheard in 739.<ref name=Kirby_133>{{cite book |last= Kirby|first= D.P.|title= The Earliest English Kings|pages=133|year= 1990|publisher= Routledge|isbn=0044456921}}</ref>  There is also evidence of South Saxon territory breaking away from West Saxon dominance in the early 720s, and this may indicate Æthelbald's increasing influence in the area, though it may also have been Kentish, rather than Mercian, influence that was weakening West Saxon control.<ref name=Kirby_131>{{cite book |last= Kirby|first= D.P.|title= The Earliest English Kings|pages=131|year= 1990|publisher= Routledge|isbn=0044456921}}</ref>

As for Kent, there is evidence from Kentish [[Chartulary|charters]] (documents recording land transactions, signed by witnesses) that shows that Æthelbald was in control of London, and a patron of Kentish churches.<ref name=Campbell_95>{{cite book |last= Campbell|first= John|coauthors= John, Eric & Wormald, Patrick|title= The Anglo-Saxons|pages=95|year= 1991|publisher= Penguin Books|isbn=0-14-014395-5}}</ref>  There is, however, no charter evidence showing Æthelbald's consent to Kentish land grants; and charters of [[Aethelberht of Kent|Aethelberht]] and [[Eadbert I of Kent|Eadberht]], both kings of Kent, survive in which there they grant land without Æthelbald's consent.  It may be that charters showing Æthelbald's overlordship simply do not survive, but the result is that there is no direct evidence of the extent of Æthelbald's influence in Kent.  For the South Saxons, there is very little charter evidence, but again, what there is does not show any requirement for Æthelbald's consent to land grants.<ref name=Kirby_132>{{cite book |last= Kirby|first= D.P.|title= The Earliest English Kings|pages=132|year= 1990|publisher= Routledge|isbn=0044456921}}</ref>   The lack of evidence should not obscure the fact that Bede, who was after all a contemporary chronicler, summarized the situation of England in 731 by listing the bishops in office in southern England, and adding that "all these provinces, together with the others south of the river Humber and their kings, are subject to Æthelbald, King of the Mercians."<ref name=Bede_PC_324 />

There is evidence that Æthelbald had to go to war to maintain his overlordship.  In 733 Æthelbald undertook an expedition against Wessex and captured the royal [[manorialism|manor]] of [[Somerton]]. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle also tells how when [[Cuthred of Wessex|Cuthred]] succeeded Aethelheard to the throne of Wessex, in 740, he "boldly made war against Aethelbald, king of Mercia".<ref name=Swanton_44>{{cite book |last= Swanton|first= Michael|title= The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle|pages=44–45|year= 1996|publisher= Routledge|isbn=0-415-92129-5}}</ref>  Three years later, Cuthred and Aethelbald are described as fighting against the Welsh.  This could have been an obligation placed on Cuthred by Mercia; earlier kings had similarly assisted [[Penda of Mercia|Penda]] and [[Wulfhere of Mercia|Wulfhere]], two strong seventh-century Mercian rulers.<ref name=Kirby_133 />  In 752, Æthelbald and Cuthred are again on opposite sides of the conflict, and according to one version of the manuscript, Cuthred "put him [Æthelbald] to flight."<ref name=Swanton_46_2>{{cite book |last= Swanton|first= Michael|title= The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle|pages=46–47|year= 1996|publisher= Routledge|isbn=0-415-92129-5}}</ref> Æthelbald seems to have reasserted his authority over the West Saxons by the time of his death, since a later West Saxon king, [[Cynewulf of Wessex|Cynewulf]], is recorded as witnessing a charter of Æthelbald at the very beginning of his reign, in 757.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+96 | title = Anglo-Saxons.net: S 96 | accessmonthday=28 April | accessyear = 2007}}</ref>

In 740, a war between the Picts and the Northumbrians is reported.  Æthelbald, who may have been allied with [[Óengus I of the Picts|Óengus]],<ref name=Campbell_95 /> the king of the Picts, took advantage of [[Eadberht of Northumbria|Eadberht]]'s absence from Northumbria to ravage his lands, and perhaps burn [[York]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Anderson|first= Alan Orr|title= Scottish Annals from English Chroniclers A.D. 500–1286|pages=55–56|year= 1908|publisher= D. Nutt}}</ref>

==Titles and Bretwaldaship==
[[Image:Aethelbald charter Cyneberht 736.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Ismere Diploma]]'', a charter of King Æthelbald's to Ealdorman Cyneberht in 736.]]Earlier in Bede's chronicle, the [[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]], he lists seven kings who governed all the southern provinces of the English, with reigns dating between the late fifth and the late seventh centuries.  Subsequently, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, another important source for the period, describes these seven as ''[[Bretwalda|bretwaldas]]'' or ''brytenwaldas'', a title translated as "Britain-ruler" or "Wide-ruler".<ref name=Swanton_60>The different versions of the title, "bretwalda" and "brytenwalda", are in the A and E texts of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, in the entry for 827.  {{cite book |last= Swanton|first= Michael|title= The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle|pages=60–61|year= 1996|publisher= Routledge|isbn=0-415-92129-5}}</ref>  The Chronicle adds only one king to this list: [[Egbert of Wessex]], who reigned in the ninth century.  The resulting list of eight ''bretwaldas'' omits several strong Mercian kings.  It is possible that the chronicler was merely adding Egbert's name to Bede's original list of seven, rather than claiming that no other kings achieved similar power in England.  The chronicler was almost certainly a West Saxon, and since neither Æthelbald nor Offa were kings of Wessex it is possible the chronicler does not mention them out of regional pride.<ref name=KL_11>See comment and footnote 2 in {{cite book |last= Keynes|first= Simon|coauthors= Lapidge, Michael|title= Alfred the Great: Asser's Life of King Alfred and other contemporary sources|pages=11,210|year= 2004|publisher= Penguin Classics|isbn=0-140-44409-2 }}</ref><ref name=BlairAITASE_201>{{cite book |last= Hunter Blair|first= Peter|title= An Introduction to Anglo-Saxon England|pages=201|year= 1960|publisher= Cambridge University Press}}</ref>  The meaning of the term "bretwalda", and the nature of the power that these eight kings wielded, has had much academic scrutiny.  One suggested interpretation is that since Bede was writing during Æthelbald's reign, the original seven he listed were essentially those kings who could be seen as prototypes of Æthelbald in their domination of Southumbrian England.<ref name=Kirby_19>{{cite book |last= Kirby|first= D.P.|title= The Earliest English Kings|pages=19|year= 1991|publisher= Unwin Hyman|isbn=0-04-445692-1}}</ref>

Further evidence of Æthelbald's power, or at least his titles, is provided by an important charter of 736, the [[Ismere Diploma]], which survives in a contemporary (and possibly original) copy.  It starts by describing Æthelbald as "king not only of the Mercians but also of all the provinces which are called by the general name South English"; in the witness list he is further named "Rex Britanniae", "King of Britain".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=get&type=charter&id=89 | title = Anglo-Saxons.net: S 89 | accessmonthday=27 April | accessyear = 2007}}</ref><ref name=Fletcher_98>{{cite book |last= Fletcher|first= Richard|title= Who's Who in Roman Britain and Anglo-Saxon England|pages=98–100|year= 1989|publisher= Shepheard-Walwyn|isbn=0-85683-089-5}}</ref> At least one historian has described this title as "a phrase which can only be interpreted as a Latin rendering of the English title ''Bretwalda''";<ref name=Stenton_203>{{cite book |last= Stenton|first= Sir Frank|title= Anglo-Saxon England|pages=203|year= 1971|publisher= Clarendon Press|isbn=0-19-821716-1}}</ref> but it may be that at that time these titles would not have been acknowledged much beyond [[Worcester]], where this and other documents from the 730s that use similar titles were written.<ref name=Kirby_130>{{cite book |last= Kirby|first= D.P.|title= The Earliest English Kings|pages=130|year= 1991|publisher= Unwin Hyman|isbn=0-04-445692-1}}</ref>

==Relations with the church==
In 745–746, the leading Anglo-Saxon missionary [[Saint Boniface|St Boniface]], along with seven other bishops, sent Æthelbald a reproachful letter, accusing him of many sins&mdash;fornication with nuns, stealing ecclesiastical revenue, violating church privileges, and imposing forced labour on the clergy.<ref name=Fletcher_98 />  Boniface sent the letter to [[Ecgbert, Archbishop of York|Ecgberht]], the archbishop of York, telling him to edit the letter as he thought best; and he also sent it to Herefrith, a priest whom Æthelbald would listen to, with the request that he read it to Æthelbald.<ref name=Kirby_135>{{cite book |last= Kirby|first= D.P.|title= The Earliest English Kings|pages=135|year= 1992|publisher= Routledge|isbn=0-415-09086-5}}</ref> Though Boniface's letter praises Æthelbald's faith and alms-giving, its criticisms have strongly coloured subsequent opinion of Æthelbald.<ref name=Fletcher_98 />  A claim made in a ninth-century document that Æthelbald had killed the kinsman of a Mercian abbess has also contributed negatively to his reputation.<ref name=Kirby_134>{{cite book |last= Kirby|first= D.P.|title= The Earliest English Kings|pages=134|year= 1992|publisher= Routledge|isbn=0-415-09086-5}}</ref>

Despite Boniface's strong criticisms, there is evidence of Æthelbald's positive interest in church affairs.  A subsequent letter of Boniface's to [[Cuthbert, Archbishop of Canterbury]], implicitly encouraged him to hold a synod, after the model of a Frankish synod Boniface described to him, and the decrees of which he included in the letter.<ref name=Kirby_134>{{cite book |last= Kirby|first= D.P.|title= The Earliest English Kings|pages=134|year= 1992|publisher= Routledge|isbn=0-415-09086-5}}</ref>  A council was subsequently held at Clovesho (the location of which is now lost); Æthelbald attended and perhaps presided.  The council was concerned with the relationship between the church and the secular world, and it condemned many excesses on the part of the clergy.<ref name=FC>Richard Fletcher says that Archbishop Cuthbert of Canterbury presided, though he adds that the council could not have been convened without royal sanction; James Campbell says that Aethelbald presided.  {{cite book |last= Fletcher|first= Richard|title= Who's Who in Roman Britain and Anglo-Saxon England|pages=100|year= 1989|publisher= Shepheard-Walwyn|isbn=0-85683-089-5}}  Also {{cite book |last= Campbell|first= John|coauthors= John, Eric & Wormald, Patrick|title= The Anglo-Saxons|pages=78|year= 1991|publisher= Penguin Books|isbn=0-14-014395-5}}</ref>  The council limited relations between monks and laymen and ruled that secular activities were impermissible for monks: secular business and secular songs were both forbidden, especially "ludicrous songs".  [[Image:Repton_crypt.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A 19th century engraving of the crypt at Repton where Æthelbald was interred.]]Two years after this, at Gumley, in 749, Æthelbald issued a charter that freed [[ecclesiastical]] lands from all obligations except the requirement to build forts and bridges&mdash;obligations which lay upon everyone, as part of the [[trinoda necessitas]].  This charter was witnessed only by Mercian bishops, and it is possible it had no effect outside Mercia, but it is also possible that it was essentially part of a reform programme inspired by Boniface and instigated at Clovesho.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=get&type=charter&id=92 | title = Anglo-Saxons.net: S 92 | accessmonthday=28 April | accessyear = 2007}}</ref><ref name=Campbell_100>{{cite book |last= Campbell|first= John|coauthors= John, Eric & Wormald, Patrick|title= The Anglo-Saxons|pages=100|year= 1991|publisher= Penguin Books|isbn=0-14-014395-5}}</ref>

==Death==
In [[757]], Æthelbald was killed at [[Seckington]], [[Warwickshire]], near the royal seat of [[Tamworth]].  According to a later continuation of [[Bede]]'s ''Ecclesiastical History'', he was "treacherously murdered at night by his own bodyguards", but the reason why is unrecorded.  He was succeeded, briefly, by [[Beornrad of Mercia|Beornrad]]. Æthelbald was buried at [[Repton]], in a crypt which still can be seen; a contemporary is reported to have seen a vision of him in hell, reinforcing the impression of a king not universally well-regarded.<ref name=Kirby_134 />  The monastery church on the site at that time was probably constructed by Æthelbald to house the royal mausoleum; other burials there include that of [[Wigstan]].<ref name=Swanton_48>{{cite book |last= Swanton|first= Michael|title= The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle|pages=48–49|year= 1996|publisher= Routledge|isbn=0-415-92129-5}}</ref><ref name=Fletcher_98 /><ref name=Fletcher_116>{{cite book |last= Fletcher|first= Richard|title= Who's Who in Roman Britain and Anglo-Saxon England|pages=116|year= 1989|publisher= Shepheard-Walwyn|isbn=0-85683-089-5}}</ref>
