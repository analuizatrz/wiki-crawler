{{Nihongo|'''''Suzuka'''''|涼風}} is a Japanese romance [[manga]] by [[Kouji Seo]]. It has been adapted into a 26-episode [[anime]] series.<ref>{{Ann anime|id=5113}}. Accessed [[2007-02-01]].</ref> The manga has been licensed for publication in North America by [[Del Rey Manga]]. The [[anime]] series has been licensed for North American release by [[Funimation]].<ref>[http://www.japanator.com/suzuka-licensed-by-funimation suzuka-licensed-by-funimation] from japanator.com. Accessed [[2007-03-16]].</ref>

== Overview ==
Suzuka was written by Kouji Seo, and featured in the Weekly Shōnen Magazine and published by Kodansha since [[3 March]] [[2004]]. As of May 2007, 16 volumes <ref>[http://www.shonenmagazine.com/php/comic.php?sakuhin_id=50 ''Shōnen Magazine'']. Accessed [[2007-05-23]].</ref> have been released and the series is still ongoing. Suzuka has many parallels to [[Love Hina]], including a girls' dormitory run by an aunt. Suzuka differs from Love Hina in story plot, especially after chapter two when the story becomes unique and plays out Yamato and his friends' lives. It should be further noted that the author, Kouji Seo, was adamant that he never intended the Suzuka series to be a harem manga, "It was my policy from the beginning that Suzuka was to be a romance story; I had no intention of creating an harem manga." <ref>Kouji Seo (Sept 16 2005). "Seo Kouji Speaks About Hashiba Miki", ''Suzuka Guide Book, Yu Kemuri Renai Hakusho'' 湯けむり恋愛白書, original Japanese language version,  Kodansha, pg 171.

An anime version was released on [[July 6]] [[2005]] by [[Studio Comet]] under director [[Hiroshi Fukutomi]], and was shown weekly on [[TV Tokyo]]. The series ends with 26 episodes, which coincides with Volume 9, Chapter 72 of the manga. The anime utilized original openings by COACH, and [[Background music|BGM]] by Takumi Masanori. The Suzuka anime series follows the manga closely.

== Plot ==
{{main|List of Suzuka chapters}}
The plot is based on a young man, Yamato Akitsuki, who moves from his rural home in [[Hiroshima]] [[prefectures of Japan|prefecture]] to live at his aunt's apartment building/indoor bath complex in [[Tokyo]] and attend the local athletics-oriented [[high school]]. Before arriving at his new home he walks past his new school and sees a young girl practicing [[high jump]] at the track field. 

He falls in love with her at first sight and does not expect to see her again. He soon discovers that the girl, Suzuka Asahina, is one of the occupants of his aunt's apartment. Because he pursues Suzuka, Yamato joins the [[track and field]] team in hopes of impressing her. Since joining the team, he discovers that he has the potential to become a top 100 meter sprinter. The story intertwines his pursuit of love and athletics.

== Characters ==
{{main|List of characters in Suzuka}}
The ''Suzuka'' series offers many unique and likable characters, all who have different personalities, ranging from the serious and introverted Suzuka to the playboy Yasunobu, from the party-animal Yuuka, to the scary-when-drunk Megumi.

== Anime ==
{{main|List of Suzuka episodes}}
The anime version features the voice talents of many new actors. There are 26 episodes released by Studio Comet, and runs a plot almost identical to the manga, except for some required changes, such as removing the constant nude shots in the manga. Likewise, while Yasunobu in the manga version thought he was being successful, the anime-version Yasunobu was able to understand his feelings. This accepting Yasunobu was portrayed more often in the anime, whereas in the manga, he usually gives perverted tips, although he is generally understanding. Another aspect left out were the many conversations that occurred in the baths, which were only shown in the manga. In addition, for probably a similar reason, the hole connecting Yamato's room with Suzuka's room was left out.
