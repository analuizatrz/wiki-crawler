==Geography and administration==
===Physical geography===
Manchester lies in a bowl-shaped land area bordered to the north and east by the [[Pennines|Pennine hills]], a mountain chain that runs the length of the [[Northern England]] and to the south by the [[Cheshire]] Plain. The city centre is on the east bank of the [[River Irwell]], near the confluence of the [[River Medlock]] and the [[River Irk]] and is relatively low-lying, being between 35 and 42 [[metre]]s (115 to 138 [[Foot (unit of length)|ft]]) above [[sea level]]. The [[River Mersey]] flows through the south of Manchester. Much of the inner city, especially in the south, is flat, offering extensive views from many highrise buildings in the city of the foothills and moors of the Pennines, which can often be capped with snow in the winter months. Surrounded by the Pennines to the north, east and south east means it is very easy to access the [[Peak District]] national park, only 21 km (13 miles) from the city centre. Manchester's geographic features were highly influential in its early development as the world's first industrial city. These features are its climate, its proximity to a [[port|seaport]] at [[Liverpool]], the availability of water power from its rivers, and its nearby [[coal]] reserves.

===Climate===
Manchester has a relatively damp climate, but it has an undeserved reputation as a rainy city. Its average annual rainfall is 809&nbsp;mm, (902&nbsp;mm from some sources) <ref>[http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=043330&refer= Manchester, England], www.weatherbase.com. URL accessed October 25, 2006.</ref> <ref>{{cite web | title=Manchester tourist guide — Geography & weather| work=Manchester Online | url=http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/tourist/geographyandweather/s/63/63975_sunshine_and_rain.html | accessmonthday=November 2 | accessyear=2005}}</ref>. For example, this total is far less than that of the rainiest British city, [[Swansea]]. In international terms, Manchester receives substantially less rain than [[New York City]], which receives 1200 mm of rain in an average year (although New York has fewer cloudy days per year), and its average annual rainfall total is comparable with that of [[Rome]]. The [[precipitation]] is, however, regularly light and prolonged, so a small volume of rain may take an hour to fall in Manchester, compared to several minutes of heavy rain in Rome. Manchester also has a relatively high humidity level, which lent itself to the optimised and breakage-free textile manufacturing which took place in there. Snowfall is not a common sight in the city, due to [[Urban climate|urban warming]]. The [[Pennines]] and [[Rossendale Forest]] hills that surround the city to its east and north receive much snow in the winter and many roads leading out of the city can be closed due to snow {{Fact|date=June 2007}}, including the [[A62 road]] via Oldham and [[Standedge]], [[Snake Pass]] the [[A57 road|A57]] towards Sheffield, and the [[M62 motorway|M62]] over [[Saddleworth Moor]].

==Etymology==
The name "Manchester" ([[IPA chart for English|pronounced]] {{IPA|/ˈmæntʃɛstə/}}) came from the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] name ''Mamucium'', thought to be a [[Latin]]isation of an original [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] name (possibly meaning "breast-like hill" from ''mamm-'' = "breast"), plus [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] ''ceaster'' = "town", which is derived from [[Latin]] ''[[castra]]'' = "camp".<ref>{{cite book|author=Mills, A. D.|title=A Dictionary of British Place-names|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn= ISBN 0-19-852758-6}}</ref>

==History==
{{main|History of Manchester}}
===Early history===
[[Image:Peterloo carlile.JPG|thumb|250px|right|The [[Peterloo massacre]].]]
The Manchester area was settled in or before [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times.<ref>Rogers, Nicholas - ''Halloween: from Pagan Ritual to Party Night'', 2003, [[Oxford University Press]], ISBN 0-1951-6896-8? P.18 </ref> The original fort was constructed by General [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]] as a staging post between [[Chester]] (''Deva'') and York (''Eboracum''). This Roman settlement was named ''Mamucium'' ([[Celtic languages|Celtic]] for "[[breast]]-shaped hill") after the hill that it was sited on to be better defensible. The original location of the fort is now in the City of [[Salford]]. 

The fort was abandoned in the [[Dark Ages]], and at some point in time the focus of settlement shifted from this spot to the confluence of the rivers [[River Irwell|Irwell]] and [[River Irk|Irk]].

In medieval times, this area included a fortified manor house. Thomas De La Warre, a manorial lord who also happened to be a priest, gave the site to the church for use as a College of Priests around 1422, and commenced the construction of the Collegiate Church. The former is now [[Chetham's School of Music]], and the latter [[Manchester Cathedral]].

Around the 13th century, Manchester grew heavily due to an influx of [[Flemish people|Flemish]] settlers who founded Manchester's new cotton industry{{Fact|date=February 2007}} and sparked the growth of the city to become [[Lancashire]]'s major industrial centre.  

===Industrial Revolution===
[[Image:Cottonopolis1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Manchester (or [[Cottonopolis]] as it was sometimes referred) during the early 19th century.]]
In the late 18th century, Manchester may have become the site of England's first entirely artificial canal when James Brindley built the [[Bridgewater Canal]] to bring coal from the eponymous Duke of Bridgewater's mines at Worsley.  During the 19th century Manchester grew to become the centre of [[Lancashire]]'s cotton industry and was dubbed "[[Cottonopolis]]". During this period the canal system grew, and Manchester became one end of the world's second passenger railway - the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]].

Manchester quickly grew into the most important industrial centre in the world, and, significantly, the first industrial society{{Fact|date=June 2007}}. The pace of change was fast and frightening. At that time, it seemed a place in which anything could happen &mdash; new industrial processes, new ways of thinking (the so called "[[Manchester School]]", promoting [[free trade]] and ''[[laissez-faire]]''), new classes or groups in society, new religious sects, and new forms of labour organisation. It attracted educated visitors from all parts of Britain and Europe. A saying capturing this sense of innovation survives today: "What Manchester does today, the rest of the world does tomorrow." [http://www.conservatives.com/tile.do?def=news.story.page&obj_id=135381] [http://www.mmu.ac.uk/studyatmmu/manchesterlife/].

As well as being a centre of capitalism the city saw its fair share of rebellion by the working and non-titled classes, with the most famous being the events on St Peter’s Field on [[16 August]] [[1819]] which have become known as '[[Peterloo]]'. The first [[Trades Union Congress]] was held in Manchester (at the Mechanics' Institute, David Street), from 2 to [[6 June]] [[1868]]. Manchester was the subject of [[Friedrich Engels]]' ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'', Engels himself spending much of his life in and around Manchester<ref>Biography of Engels, Marx-Engels Internet Archive [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/bio/engels/en-1893.htm </ref>. Manchester was also an important cradle of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and the [[Suffragette]] Movement.

Manchester's golden age was perhaps the last quarter of the nineteenth century. Many of the great public buildings (including the Town Hall) date from then. The city's cosmopolitan atmosphere contributed to a vibrant culture, which included the [[Hallé Orchestra]]. In 1889, when county councils were created in [[England]], the municipal borough became a [[county borough]] with even greater autonomy. During this period, the [[Manchester Ship Canal]] was created by the canalisation of the  Rivers Irwell and Mersey for 36 miles from Salford to the Mersey estuary at the port of Liverpool. This enabled ocean going ships to sail right into the Salford docks. The docks functioned up until the 1970s, with their closure leading to a large increase in unemployment in the area{{Fact|date=June 2007}}.

Manchester suffered greatly from the inter-war depression and the underlying structural changes that began to supplant the old industries, including textile manufacture.

===World War II===
During [[World War II]] Manchester was involved in heavy industrial construction. It was home to [[Avro]] (now [[BAE Systems]]) which built countless aircraft for the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), the most famous being the [[Avro Lancaster]] bomber{{Fact|date=June 2007}}. The city was attacked a number of times by the [[Luftwaffe]], particularly in the "Christmas Blitz" of 1941, which destroyed a large part of the historic city centre.  In 1940 [[Manchester Cathedral]] was partially destroyed by a [[Germany|German]] air-raid.<ref>[http://www.manchestercathedralonline.co.uk/timeline2.html "Historical Timeline"] Manchester Cathedral's website</ref>
[[Image:Manchesterbomb-devestation.jpg|thumb|230px|right|The devastation left by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] [[1996 Manchester bombing|bombing]]]]

===1996 Manchester bombing===
{{main|1996 Manchester bombing}}

On [[15 June]] [[1996]], the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) detonated a large [[1996 Manchester bombing|bomb in the city centre]]. The largest to be detonated on British soil, the bomb blast caused over 200 injuries and heavily damaged nearby buildings.

===Redevelopment===
[[Image:ManchesterCore.PNG|thumb|200px|left|[[Manchester City Centre]] from the [[Beetham Tower, Manchester|Beetham Tower]]]]
Spurred by the regeneration after the [[1996 Manchester bombing|1996 IRA bomb]] and aided by the [[2002 Commonwealth Games|XVII Commonwealth Games]], Manchester's city centre has undergone a continued regeneration. New and renovated complexes such as [[The Printworks]] and the Triangle have become popular shopping and entertainment destinations. The completion of the renovated [[Manchester Arndale]] in September 2006 allowed the centre to hold the title of Europe's largest '''''city centre''' shopping mall''.<ref>[http://www.cadweb.co.uk/aboutus/pdf_docs/Arndale_Project_Sheet.pdf "CADWeb Project Management - Manchester Arndale"], CADWeb, [[2005]], retrieved [[28 June]] [[2007]]</ref>
[[Image:Manchester Exchange Squares.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Exchange Square (Manchester)|Exchange Square]] undergoing regeneration.]]


Large sections of the city dating from the 1960s have been either demolished and re-developed or modernised with the use of glass and steel, including the [[Manchester Arndale]]. Old mills have been converted into modern apartments, [[Hulme]] has undergone extensive regeneration programmes, and million-pound lofthouse apartments have since been developed. The 169 metre tall, 47-storey [[Beetham Tower, Manchester|Beetham Tower]], completed in 2006, is the tallest building in the UK outside London and highest residential accommodation in the Western Europe. The lower 23 floors form the [[Hilton]] Hotel, featuring a 'sky bar' on the 23rd floor. Its upper 24 floors are apartments.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4944590.stm "City building reaches full height"], BBC, [[26 April]] [[2006]], retrieved [[2 May]] [[2006]].</ref>

===SuperCasino===
In January 2007, Manchester was briefly awarded the licence to build the only [[supercasino]] allowed in the UK, but in March 2007 the [[House of Lords]] rejected the decision by three votes rendering the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] acceptance meaningless. This leaves the supercasino and the other fourteen smaller sites awarded smaller concessions in parliamentary limbo until a final decision is made.<ref>[http://www.culture.gov.uk/cap/pressnotices/press_finalpanelreport300107.htm Casino Advisory Panel Recommendation]</ref>

==Politics==
[[Image:ManchesterTownHall OwlofDoom.jpg|thumb|[[Manchester Town Hall]], used for local and parliamentary government, is a fine example of [[Victorian era]] [[Gothic revival]] architecture.]]
{{main|Politics in Manchester}}
Manchester is represented by three tiers of government: Manchester City Council ("local"), UK Parliament ("national"),
and European Parliament ("Europe").

The City of Manchester forms part of the [[metropolitan county]] of [[Greater Manchester]], the county council of which was abolished (along with the other metropolitan counties) in 1986. Manchester consists of several districts, but these districts do not represent a tier of government, though the names are used as political wards.

==Economics==
{{main|Economy of Manchester}}
Manchester's [[Central Business District]] is in the centre of the city, adjacent to Piccadilly, focused on Mosley Street, Deansgate, King Street and Piccadilly. [[Spinningfields]] is a large new business centre west of Deansgate that will serve as home to several headquarters, squares, and cafes. The first building on the site was the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]]'s new headquarters<ref name=RBS-Spinnngfield>[http://www.rbs.com/media03.asp?id=MEDIA_CENTRE/PRESS_RELEASES/2006/JANUARY/26_SPINNINGFIELDS RBS Press releases], www.rbs.co.uk, RBS Spinningfields press release. URL accessed May 30, 2007.</ref> on Deansgate. The project is being spear-headed by [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Sir Norman Foster]]. Other buildings include a 110 metre tall office building, a new civil justice centre<ref> [http://www.spinningfields-manchester.com/spinningfields/buildings_civilJusticeCentre.htm Spinningfields Civil Justice Centre] URL accessed June 28, 2007</ref> and new Migistrates Court<ref> [http://www.spinningfields-manchester.com/spinningfields/buildings_magistrates.htm Spinningfields Magistrates Court] URL accessed June 28, 2007</ref>, to be built over the next few years.

==Demographics==
The [[United Kingdom Census 2001]] showed a total population for Manchester of 392,819, a 9.2% decline from the 1991 census.<ref name=stats-gov-manc>[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/profiles/00BN-A.asp Manchester], www.statistics.gov.uk, National Statistics.

Inhabitants of Manchester are known as ''Mancunians'' or Mancs for short. Manchester reported the second-lowest proportion of the population in employment of any area in the UK. A  primary reason cited for Manchester's high unemployment figures is the high proportion of the population who are students.<ref name=stats-gov-manc>[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/profiles/00BN-A.asp Manchester], www.statistics.gov.uk, National Statistics.

==Education==
[[Image:Main Quadrangle University of Manchester by Nick Higham.jpg|thumb|180px|right|The Old Quadrangle of the [[University of Manchester]]]]
===Universities===
Manchester is home to two major [[University|universities]] - the [[University of Manchester]] and [[Manchester Metropolitan University]]  - which are both located to the south of the city centre. The University of Manchester is the largest full-time non-collegiate university in the United Kingdom, and was created in autumn 2004 by the merger of [[Victoria University of Manchester]] and [[UMIST]]. Manchester Metropolitan University was formed out of the old [[Polytechnic#United Kingdom|polytechnic college]] in the city and subsequently took over the old Crewe and Alsager College of Higher Education in South Cheshire

The University of Manchester, Manchester Metropolitan University and the [[Royal Northern College of Music]] are all grouped together on the southern side of the city centre, and effectively form one large campus along and near to Oxford Road (with the exception of the North Campus of the University of Manchester, which was the [[UMIST]] campus before the merger). [[Manchester Business School]], which offered the first MBA course in the UK in 1965, forms a part of the University of Manchester.

===Schools===
One of Manchester's most notable secondary schools is the [[Manchester Grammar School]].  Established in 1515 as a free grammar school next to what is now the Cathedral, it moved in 1930 to Old Hall Lane in Fallowfield, South Manchester, to accommodate the growing student body.  In the post-war period, it was a direct-grant [[grammar school]] (i.e. partially state funded), but it reverted to independent status in 1976 after abolition of the direct-grant system. Its previous premises are now used by [[Chetham's School of Music]]. There are two schools nearby: [[Withington Girls' School]] and [[Manchester High School for Girls]].

[[Image:Beetham tower.jpg|thumb|left|190px|[[Beetham Tower, Manchester|Beetham Tower]] on [[Deansgate]]. An example of Manchester's new [[skyscrapers]].]]
Manchester has a wide variety of buildings, ranging from [[Victorian architecture]] to modern. Much of the architecture in the city harks back to its days as a global centre for the [[cotton]] trade. Manchester also has a number of [[Tallest Buildings of Manchester|skyscrapers]] mostly built during the 1960s and 1970s, although recently there has been a renewed interest in building more. [[Beetham Tower, Manchester|Beetham Tower]], completed in 2006, includes a Hilton hotel, a restaurant, and residences.  It is currently the tallest building in the UK outside of London. An even taller building, the [[Inacity Tower]], is scheduled to commence construction in 2007 behind [[Manchester Piccadilly station]].

==Transportation==
{{main|Transport in Manchester}}
Manchester and the surrounding communities in the North West of England are served by an international airport as well as a major motorway and rail network. The [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] was the first passenger railway in the world. Greater Manchester has an extensive citywide railway network, and two mainline stations. A network of bus routes and a modern tram system radiates from the city centre. A canal network also remains from the industrial revolution.

Greater Manchester has a higher percentage of the motorway network than any other county in the country.<ref> [http://www.oldham.ac.uk/study/local The Metropolitan County of Greater Manchester has the most extensive motorway network in the United Kingdom.] Oldham College -About Manchester URL accessed June 28, 2007</ref> According to the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'', it has the most traffic lanes side by side (17), spread across several parallel carriageways ([[M61 motorway|M61]] at Linnyshaw Moss, Greater Manchester, close to the [[M60 motorway|M60]] interchange).<ref> [http://www.cbrd.co.uk/roadsfaq/#446 British Roads Database] www.cbrd.co.uk URL accessed June 28, 2007</ref>

===Nightlife===
There has long been a thriving [[nightclub]] culture in Manchester. One of the oldest venues is the [[Band on the Wall]], a live music club in the [[Northern Quarter]]. It was built around 1862 as the flagship pub of a local brewery and originally called The George & Dragon. In 1975 it was taken on by jazz musician Steve Morris and Frank Cusick, and renamed The Band on the Wall, a longtime nickname for the club since the late 1920s alluding to its stage high on the back wall.

===Music===
{{main|Music of Manchester|List of bands from Manchester}}
Manchester is home to two [[symphony orchestra]]s, the [[Hallé Orchestra]] and the [[BBC Philharmonic Orchestra]]. There is also a [[chamber orchestra]], the Manchester Camerata. In the 1950s the city was home to the so-called ‘Manchester School’ of classical composers, which comprised [[Harrison Birtwistle]], [[Peter Maxwell Davies]], [[David Ellis]] and [[Alexander Goehr]]. Manchester is a centre for musical education, with the [[Royal Northern College of Music]] and [[Chetham's School of Music|Chetham’s School of Music]]. The main classical venue was the [[Free Trade Hall]] on Peter Street, until the 1996 debut of the 2,500 seat concert venue [[Bridgewater Hall]]. 

Manchester’s main pop music venue is the [[Manchester Evening News Arena]], situated next to [[Manchester Victoria railway station]]. It seats over 21,000, is the largest arena of its type in Europe, and has been voted ''International Venue of the Year''<ref>[http://www.pollstaronline.com/PCIA-Static/2001winners.htm "Pollstar Concert Industry Awards 2001"], Pollstar, retrieved [[24 June]] [[2007]].</ref>.

Other Greater Manchester natives include [[Richard Ashcroft]] and [[Jay Kay]] of [[Jamiroquai]].

===Literature===
In the 19th century, Manchester figured in novels that discussed the changes that industrialisation had brought to Britain. These included works such as ''Mary Barton: A Tale of Manchester Life'' (1848) by [[Elizabeth Gaskell]], [http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/gaskell_elizabeth.shtml], and ''The Condition of the English Working Class in 1844'', written by [[Friedrich Engels]] while living and working in Manchester. [[Charles Dickens]] is reputed to have set his novel ''[[Hard Times]]'' in the city, and while it is partly modelled on Preston, it shows the influence of his friend Elizabeth Gaskell [http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/dickens/pva/pva27.html].

===Theatre===
Larger venues include [[the Manchester Opera House]], featuring large scale touring shows and [[West End theatre|West End]] shows, the [[Palace Theatre, Manchester|Palace Theatre]], the [[Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester|Royal Exchange Theatre]] in Manchester’s former cotton exchange, and the [[Lowry Centre]], a touring venue in Salford.

The city is where programmes including World's oldest and most watched television soap opera ''[[Coronation Street]]'' which is networked 5 times a week on [[ITV1]] is made. Local News for the Granada Region, local programmes and Networked [[CiTV|Children’s ITV]] presentations are produced in Manchester.

Hit television series ''[[Life on Mars (TV series)|Life on Mars]]'' was based in 1973 around the city of Manchester.  The [[BBC]] will shortly move to a bold new development in nearby [[Salford Quays]].

Manchester is one of the three main BBC bases in England, the others being in [[London]] and [[Bristol]]. Manchester is also the regional base for the [[BBC One]] North West Region so programmes like ''North West Tonight'' are produced here. The BBC intends to relocate large numbers of staff and facilities to Media City at Salford Quays from London. The Children's ([[CBBC]]), Comedy, Sport ([[BBC Sport]]) and New Media departments are all scheduled for a move from London to MediaCity at [[Salford Quays]] before 2010.

Manchester has its own television channel, [[Channel M]], owned by the [[Guardian Media Group]] and operated since 2000. The station produces almost all content including local news locally and is available nationally on the [[BSkyB]] television platform. 

The city also has the highest number of local radio stations outside London including [[BBC Radio Manchester]], [[Key 103]], [[Galaxy Manchester|Galaxy]], [[Piccadilly Magic 1152]], [[105.4 Century FM]], [[Smooth FM 100.4|100.4 Smooth FM]], Capital Gold 1458, 96.2 [[The Revolution (radio station)|The Revolution]] and [[Xfm Manchester|Xfm]].

Defunct radio stations include Sunset (which became) [[Kiss 102]] (now Galaxy), and KFM which became Signal Cheshire (now [[Signal 1]]). These stations, as well as [[pirate radio]], played a significant role in the city's [[House music]] culture, also known as the [[Madchester]] scene, which was based around clubs like the [[The Haçienda]] which had its own show on Kiss 102. 

Erstwhile producer and radio personality [[Karl Pilkington]], of ''[[The Ricky Gervais Show]]'' fame, hails from Manchester.

{{Seealso|Films set in Manchester}}

===Magazines and newspapers===
''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper was founded in Manchester in 1821 as ''The Manchester Guardian''. Its head office is still in Manchester, though many of its management functions were moved to [[London]] in 1964. It shares an office on Hardman Street with sister publication ''[[Manchester Evening News]]'' (biggest-selling daily paper although now free within the city centre), and the Manchester Metro News (free weekly, Greater Manchester's biggest-circulation newspaper). Another free newspaper is the [[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]] North West, available from [[Metrolink]] stops, rail stations and other busy locations.

For many years most of the national newspapers had offices in Manchester: ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', ''[[Daily Express]]'', ''[[Daily Mail]]'', ''[[The Daily Mirror]]'', ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]''. Only ''[[The Daily Sport]]'' remain based in Manchester. At its height, 1,500 journalists were employed. But in the 1980s office closures began and today the "second Fleet Street" is no more. A late attempt to launch a Northern daily newspaper, ''North West Times'', floundered in the late 1980s lasting just three months. Another attempt was made with the ''[[North West Enquirer]]'', which hoped to provide a true "regional" newspaper for the [[North West England|North West]], much in the same vein as the ''[[Yorkshire Post]]'' does for [[Yorkshire]] or ''[[The Northern Echo]]'' does for the [[North East England|North East]]. It folded in October 2006.

There are several local lifestyle magazines, including 'YQ Magazine' and 'Moving Manchester'.
