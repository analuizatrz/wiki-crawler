'''Indian names''' are based on a variety of systems and [[naming conventions]], which vary from region to region. Names are also influenced by religion and caste and may come from mythology or epics. India's population speaks a [[Languages of India|wide variety]] of [[language]]s and nearly every major religion in the world has a substantial following in India. This variety makes for subtle, often confusing, differences in names and naming styles. For example, the concept of a second name did not exist widely in [[South India]] until modern [[legal systems]] initiated the use of second names to reduce the occurrence of name clashes.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

For many Indians, their birth name is different from their official name; the birth name starts with a letter considered auspiscious on the basis of the person's horoscope. Some children are given three names: a unique first name, an (often) unique middle name, and a last name, which is usually the family name. It can also be a god's name, or the grandfather's or grandmother's name, depending on the sex of the child. Many children are given two names: a first and a last. The first name is often unique and the last name is usually the family name. One person having four names is uncommon, as are persons with single, unique names.

==Given names==
A [[proper name]], or given name, is the name to which a person most often answers. Usually this name is also used in legal documents and official records. In some parts of India, the second name is used to indicate respect. Second names are often suffixed by '-ji' or '-saheb'/'-sahib' to indicate respect in informal conversation.

Close relatives and friends call others simply by their given name. In some regions, especially in rural India, a married woman's name may be dropped entirely; she is instead addressed as "wife of [husband's name]" or "mother of [son/daughter's name]". In some instances, a married woman is given a different given name by her husband's family. When several people in a community have the same given name, adjectives such as 'big'/'small', 'old'/'young,' or other nicknames may be used to distinguish them.

==Names by caste==
For [[Hindu]]s belonging to the upper [[caste]]s, the lineage of a person is known through his or her [[gotra]], which is usually the name of the first traceable paternal ancestor in their lineage, like atreya, koundinya etc. For some people, it may be the ancestral profession or village name. Two people of the same gotra cannot wed, as they are supposed to be related filially. Lower caste Hindus often lack formal last names. Some use place names or caste names as surnames. Muslims often use two given names instead of surnames.

Many upper caste Indians use ancestral village names, occupations, honorifics, titles, caste or clan derivatives as their family names. The subcaste names are themselves derived from occupations or characterics of the subcaste ie: Within subcastes among Telugu brahmins: "Niogi" derives from ancestral appointments as ministers of the royal court. "Vaideeki" denotes an ancestor who followed the profession of religious teaching, and "Velanati" and "Telaganya" indicate the ancestral places of their origin. These are used for subcaste identification and not necessarily indicated as part of the name.

Sometimes a family name is added on to the end of the name as an initial, eg. Noushad S. U. (or S. U. Noushad) the shortened form of Noushad Shafi Ulooji, which is interpreted as Noushad, son of Shafi of the Ulooji family. 

==Names by region==

In [[Maharashtra]] many family names are derived by attaching a "kar" to their place of origin. e.g. people whose last name is [[Gavaskar]] trace back their origin to the town of Gavas, The Tendulkars trace their origins to Tendol, Pawaskar to Pawas, and so on. Some Hindu families have names that reflect the academic achievements of their forefathers. e.g., [[Sastri]] - one who has studied the [[Sastra]]s, [[Dwivedi]] - one who has studied two [[veda]]s, [[Trivedi]] - three vedas, [[Chaturvedi]] - four vedas. Others include Pathak, Acharya, Upadhyaya, Pandit, etc. Interestingly, the last name Upadhyaya has gone through changes over time due to localization in different parts of India. E.g. Upadhyaya in Sanskrit (for teachers), becomes Upadhye or Padhye in Marathi. It became Uvajjhaya in Prakrit, from which surnames such as Ojha (found in Gujarat and central India), Jha (Bihar and UP), and Vajhe (in Marathi) are derived.

==Names by religion==

===Hindu names===

Typically a [[Hindu]] name will have a given first name, may or may not have a middle name (which can be the father's name in some regions like [[Maharashtra]] or [[Gujarat]] or simply Kumar for males and Kumari for females), and a last name or family name. Again, [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] was an example of this; he was the son of Karamchand Gandhi, and his own sons all had the middle name Mohandas. Similarly [[Subhadra Kumari Chauhan]] is a female name with middle name as kumari indicating she is a female. [[Amitabh Bachchan]] is a name where Amitabh is the first name and Bachchan is the surname or family name and is without a middle name.

===Muslim names===

The pattern of Muslim names is similar to [[Muslim names]] elsewhere.

===Sikh names===

A person's religious affiliations also affects his or her last name. [[Sikh]] men all use ''[[Singh]]'' (meaning lion-hearted) as a suffix to their names and that is often used just as any other last name would be. Sikh women use ''Kaur''(meaning princess). The name "Singh" predates the Sikh faith and is still common amongst upper caste Kshatriyas; both as "Singh" or the suffix "-sinh" as part of their given or family names. [[Manmohan Singh]], the current [[Prime Minister of India]] belongs to the [[Sikhism|Sikh faith]]. Some Sikhs use Singh as a middle name and use a last name that identifies their clan or hometown, like the cricketer [[Navjot Singh Sidhu]]. 

===Jain names===

[[Jain]]s, followers of [[Mahavira]], often use the last name ''Jain''. Like "Singh", this is also a surname used by other [[Hindu]]s especially upper caste [[Thakur]]s (Kshatriyas) or [[Rajput]]s.  

===Christian names===

[[Christian]] names in India have over the past two centuries evolved into a unique amalgamation of Indian and Western patterns. For example consider X. Antony Alex Miranda - Here, X represents Xavier, his father; Miranda is the surname or family name; Antony and Alex are the first and second names.

Christian names have strong regional influences too. Naming styles in Kerala are different from Goa or for that matter North east.

==Names by profession==

The [[caste]] or subcaste name is often used as part of a name or as a title. These are analogous to western family names like Smith and Barber to the extent that they represent occupation. [[Reddy]] ([[Hindu]] [[Telugu people|Telugu]] landowner caste) is an example. [[Mohandas Gandhi]] belonged to the caste of Gandhis (grocers). Where the use of surnames was not customary, use of the [[caste]] name as the surname is increasing in recent times. Examples of surnames of this kind from southern India include  [[Iyer]], [[Iyengar]], [[Gounder]], Gowda, Nair, Naidu, Patel, Shetty/Setty. 

There are a few [[exogamous]] divisions within castes. These are usually on the basis of deities worshipped by the family. For example, Tamma (within the Reddy caste). This is widely followed by the Telugu people. The last name name of [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]], another Independence-era leader, belongs to this category. This is more common among castes, like the Brahmins, that are spread throughout the country. [[Kamath]] and [[Shenoy]] are both [[Konkan]]i Brahmin last names. [[Clan]] names are used only in small communities scattered around the country. The [[Chota Nagpur]] tribals use as clan names the names of animal [[deities]] with whom they claim kinship. The [[Kodava]]s of South India also have clan names.

Some families in India rename themselves on the basis of their profession. This is common among the [[Parsi]]s, who often have surnames ending with "wala" (also spelled "walla" or "wallah"), meaning someone who engages in a particular activity. Names like Screwala when the person might have sold screws, or Cyclewala (cycle seller) are quite common; one [[Bollywood]] actress is named [[Shenaz Treasurywala]]. Many social ranks were also hereditary. Names such as [[Talukdar]], [[Tehsildar]], [[Tarafdar]] and Pillai are based on social rank.

Some English occupational nouns have also passed into surname usage, with surnames such as Engineer. [[Rajesh Pilot]], an Indian ex-minister, adopted his surname after a stint in the [[Indian Air Force]].

It is also common for people to name their children after international personalities. Most of the times the surname is used as a first name, like [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], [[Churchill]], [[John F Kennedy|Kennedy]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Shakespeare]] etc., and tend to denote the parents' political affiliations. Like in Western societies, parents are beginning to experiment with uncommon names, or are using words that aren't usually considered names, like Proton Padmanabhan, Alpha Jyothis and Omega Jyothis.

==South Indian names==
For a long time, South Indians had a simple naming system. Historically, everyone was given a single name, which was chosen in one of three ways that South Indians chose their names on the basis of:

* The name of their village/town, e.g. [[Hattiangdi]], [[Kokradi]],[[Mangalore]] etc.
* Their family name, e.g. [[Pulithevar]]
* or both, e.g. [[Dantoj]] [[Pranith]] [[Kumar]]

The concepts of initials, middle names, family names and surnames are foreign to Tamiliana. Everyone had a single name like ''Murugesh'' or ''Lakshmanan''. Occasionally these names were extremely lengthy. A lengthy name could be interpreted as a sign of parental affection. However it was not the full name of a particular family, nor did it give more information about that family.

Under [[British India|British rule]], Indians were expected to follow English procedures for official purposes such as registering births, enrolling children in school and registering land ownership details.

Many South Indians, especially the Telugu people, use the name of their ancestral hometown, or the family profession as the family name. In this case the surname is placed before the given name. Some Tamil people have both a village name and a caste name as part of their name, for instance ''Madurai Mani Iyer''. Here, [[Madurai]] is a town and [[Iyer]] is a caste. Many Keralites especially Syrian Christians use as their last name the "tharavaad", a description of their ancestral home. Names like Pramod Perumparambil and Paul Chemmanoor fall under this category.

In southern India, especially in [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Kerala]] where caste symbols tend to be kept private, there is widespread usage of a [[patronymic]]: use of the father's given name as the second name. This means that the given name of one generation becomes the second name of the next. In many cases, this second name is used as an initial and the given name may appear like a second name. For example a name like "Ajith Abraham" means "Ajith son of Abraham". If Ajith then has a son named Ashwin, then his name would be Ashwin Ajith. 

It is common for Tamil women to adopt their husband’s first name as their own surname. Sunitha Gopalan (Sunitha daughter of Gopalan) might change her name to Sunitha Rajiv (Sunitha wife of Rajiv) after marriage. Some South Indians use an inverted patronym as their last names. For example, Chitra Visweswaran is a dancer whose last name is either a patronym or the given name of her husband. More common among women, the inverted patronym is also adopted by people migrating West who want to be called by their given names without having to explain Indian naming conventions. Their last names are then the given names of their fathers or husbands. 

Among Christians in Kerala, it is a common practice to have a middle name which is the baptismal name, usually the first name of a grandparent or godparent, like Roshni Mary George and Anoop Antony Philip. Until about two decades ago, some people were named in the 'Family name-Given name-Caste' format. Eg Kannoth [[Karunakaran]] Maarar, interpreted as Karunakaran of the Maarar caste from the Kannoth family.

===Initials===
In Western societies, when there are two people with the same name, for example, Robert Jones and Robert Smith, in an elementary school class, they are referred to as Robert J. and Robert S. respectively to avoid confusion. But two Ramans in South India do not have different surnames, since Raman is their only name. So the names of their fathers are used as initials instead of a surname. Raman, son of Gopal, would be G. Raman, and Raman, son of Dinesh, D. Raman. This led to the initial system, mostly followed in South India. Most schools automatically add the initials upon enrollment. In certain societies, a person without an initial is presumed illegitimate, and may be looked down upon. An initial is also compulsory for government records. A missing initial in certificates, bank transactions and so on may be considered illegal.

In some parts of Tamil Nadu, traditional family names have recently been abandoned in favour of a father's/husband's first name as a family name.  The use of a father's/husband's first name as a family name is in vogue. These family names are also used as initials. School and college records would have the names with initials as given below. 
* "S. Janaki" - the family name initial and then the given name. 
* "S. Janaki" might also be written as "Janaki Sridar" in legal documents.

Legal documents such as passports will have the last name fully expanded, instead of initials. Other legal documents such as property deeds will have any of these name formats with the mention of father’s /grandfather’s/husband’s name and/or village/town/city name. Mandating expansion of initials in passport and MNCs that are influenced by western standards are big source of confusion in South India--letter for Raja Gopala Varma, son of Krishna Kumar who is usually referred as "K. Raja Gopala Varma" will be addressed wronlgy as "Krishna Kumar Raja Gopala Varma".

Men's names are usually prefixed with initials as mentioned before. Some men used to omit the initial, adding the father's name in the end. However, this isn't a legal name and won't change their name in official records. For example, both [[P. Chidambaram]] and ''Chidambaram Palaniyappan'' are valid; however the latter form is not legally used. Generally, the initials are omitted, and father's name is suffixed in order to shorten a name, for example, G. Raja Ravi Varma, son of M. Gopal Krishnan, becomes Raja Gopal. 

For women, the system of initials is slightly different. Before marriage, a girl uses her father's initial, but after marriage, she uses her husband's initial. Of late the trend has changed and many women, especially those employed, do not change the initials, but continue with their father's initials. This is mainly for convenience, since school degree and career papers have the woman's father's initials on them. Changing a name legally is a cumbersome procedure, including announcing the proposed change in a newspaper and getting it published in an official gazette. So the modern trend is to add the husband's name in the end, like some Western women who add their husband’s name with a hyphen.

People who do not understand the South Indian naming protocol sometimes expand the initials in an incorrect manner. For example, the name P. Chidambaram, tends to be expanded to Palaniyappan Chidambaram, which is incorrect in the sense that it implies that the person's first name is "Palaniyappan", and the last name or the family name is "Chidambaram". In fact, the person's only name is "Chidambaram", with an initial of "P". Other such famous misrepresentations include the chess grandmaster, V. Anand (wrongly expanded as Vishwanathan Anand); cricketer, L. Sivaramakrishnan (Laxman is his father's name); and the freedom fighter and statesman, [[C. Rajagopalachari]] (often cited as Chakravarty Rajagopalachari). On the other hand, north India media refers to Dr Anbumani (son of Dr Ramadoss) often simply as Dr Ramadoss, which again is wrong as Ramadoss is his father's name and not surname.

===Surnames or family names===
Many South Indians also use a [[family name]].

Last names are not common among the [[Tamil people]], but most of the rest of India uses a family name.

# Invented family names such as that of Rajesh Pilot.
# The English last name of Anglo-Indians - descendants of British and Indian parents.
# Portuguese-Goan last names, such as Fernandes.
# Third- or later generation expatriate Indians and others who now have last names that were the given names of one of their ancestors or have intermarried enough to ensure that the last names are not caste/religion names in disguise.

====Tamil names====
Many Tamils use a "vilasam". That gives the initials (a syllable in [[Tamil language|Tamil]]) of the person's paternal ancestors up to, say, seven generations. This keeps every one readily identifiable. For example, in a reasonably sized community Mu. Ko. Ka. Mu. Tha. Er. Ganesh would be the cousin of Mu. Ko. Ka. Mu. Tha. Ka. Ganesh.

Nowadays, the complete vilasam is used only on important occasions - more commonly, only the first initial (father's) is used. Caste names are rarely used, since they are not unique. 

The father's first name will be the family name (or the last name) of a person in some Tamil communities. This is because most Tamil family names are the caste names, and it is not common to use the caste name, especially with the younger generation. Unique family names are hidden in the sub-caste which is called "Kulam" or "Kothiram".

Eg: Chinnakavanam Vittal Babu Hariharan, where Hariharan is the name of the person, Vittal Babu is the name of the father and Chinnakavanam is the name of the village from where they have originated.

====Malayali (Kerala) names====
Most Keralites, like in the case of Telugus, have a family name. Most of the family names are of obscure origin, but many have geographical origins -- e.g., Vadakkedath (from the North), Meleveettil (from the upper house) etc. Traditionally the full names followed one of two patterns:
# ''Family name followed by Given name followed usually by the caste name or title''. This was the common pattern (for men and women) among the upper-caste Hindus, especially of [[Malabar]] and [[Cochin]]. Examples: Sunil Vettickal or [[Vallathol Narayana Menon]] (Vallathol is the family name or tharavad name, Narayana(n) is the given name and Menon is the caste name), Olappamanna Subramanian Nambudiri, [[E.K. Nayanar|Erambala Krishnan Nayanar]], etc. Sometimes the caste name/title was omitted, e.g., [[K. Karunakaran|Kannoth Karunakaran]] (where the caste name [[Marar]] has been omitted). In the case of women the caste name/title was, traditionally, always omitted, instead the title "Amma" was frequently used, e.g., [[Balamani Amma|Nalappat Balamani Amma]] whose brother was Nalappat Narayana Menon. Quite often the family name will have more than one part to it, e.g., [[E. M. S. Namboodiripad|Elankulam Manakkal Sankaran Namboodiripad]], [[M.T. Vasudevan Nair|M T Vasudevan Nair]], etc. The family name is usually initialled, the given name is sometimes initialled (never when there is no caste name following) and the caste name (if present) is never initialled. This is completely arbitrary. So we have as common forms Vallathol Narayana Menon, C Achutha Menon, E K Nayanar and P Bhaskaran (here Bhaskaran is the given name; the caste name, Menon in this case, has been omitted).
# ''Family name followed by Father's given name followed by Given name''. This is common among the rest of the population. For example most traditional Christian names followed this pattern. Usually the Family name and Father name were initialled. In case of (Hindu) women "Amma" was frequently used (as in the previous case). Examples include K M Mani, [[K. G. George|K G George]], [[V.S. Achuthanandan|V S Achuthanandan]], [[K.R. Gowri Amma|K R Gowri Amma]]. Many [[Palakkad Iyers]] (Kerala Iyers) use an adaptation of this convention by replacing the Family Name with the name of the "gramam" (village). Example: Kavassery Venkitraman Krishnan, where Kavassery would be the village name, Venkitraman is the Father's given name and Krishnan is the given name; or Guruvayoor Shankaranarayanan Lalitha abbreviated as G. S. Lalitha.
# ''Given Name followed by Title.''This is common particularly among Syrian Christians in the old central Travancore area, where the king (Maharaja) or the local ruler (Raja or Thampuran) used to assign some titles to select families. Examples include Varghese Vaidyan(Vaidyan), Fr. Geevarghese Panicker (Panicker), Chacko Muthalaly (Muthalaly), Mahesh Tharakan (Tharakan), Varkey Vallikappen (Vallikappen), etc.

Much of these traditional naming patterns have now disappeared. The family names are usually not included nowadays (this can probably be attributed to the decline of the joint families or tharavads). The most common patterns nowadays is to have given names, followed by the father's given name (e.g., Sunil Narayanan or Anil Varghese) or caste name (e.g., Anup Nair). Sometimes (especially in the case of women) both the Fathers and Mothers given names are used as part of the name, e.g., L Athira Krishna. It is also not uncommon for the village of origin to be use in lieu of the family name, especially in South Kerala, e.g., [[Kavalam Narayana Panicker]], where [[Kavalam]] is a village in [[Alapuzha]] district.

It should be observed that many of the so-called Christian surnames such as Varghese or Kuruvilla are in fact, properly speaking, not surnames at all. They are just given names. Due to the modern shift towards complete names (as mentioned in the preceding paragraph) these have become de facto surnames in many cases.

====Kannada names====
[[Kannada]] names might include place names, clan/title/caste names, father's names along with person's own name. The rules generally followed when combinations of the names used;

* The place name should always come first.
eg. Kadidal Manjappa, where Kadidal is place name and Manjappa is person's name.

* Father's name should always come second.
eg. [[Kuvempu|Kuppalli Venkatappa Puttappa]], where Kuppalli is place name, Venkatappa is father's name and Puttappa is person's name.

* Initials from fathers Name and Place name
e.g [[A.B. Narendra|Adnoor Bheemappa Narendra]], where Adnoor is place name, Bheemappa is father's name and Narendra is person's name. Adnoor and Bheemappa can be initialled resulting in the name "A.B.Narendra".

* The clan/title/caste names (generally called [[surnames]]) must come last.
eg. Panemangalooru Ramesh [[Shenoy]], Panemangalooru is place name, Ramesh is person's name and [[Shenoy]] is the surname.
eg. Satish Ramanath Hegde, Satish is person's name, Ramanath is father's name and Hegde is the title(surname).

* Rare cases of ancestral housenames can also be found, and they follow the rule for place names.

However, if a person wants to go by only his/her name, there is a tendency in official circles to forcibly add extra names (generally, the place names).

===='''Malaysian Indian Names - South Indian Origin'''====
Most ethnic Indians in Malaysia trace their ancestral origin to South India. In Malaysia, the general naming format format for Indians is X son of Y or X daughter of Y. The term 'son of' is ANAK LELAKI (abbreviated to A/L in ID documents) in the Malay Language and the term 'daughter of' is ANAK PEREMPUAN (abbreviated to A/P in ID documents) in the Malay Language. 
*In the British colonial days, male Indian names would employ the connective term S/O (son of) and female Indian names D/O (daughter of) respectively, and these terms are still in common use in [[Singapore]].

'''Example:''' Murugan the son of Vellupillai would appear as MURUGAN A/L VELLUPILLAI in Malaysian ID Card (MyKad) in the name field and the Malaysian Passport.

In the eyes of authorities in the West, the connective term A/L (son of in the Malay Language) appears deceptively similar to the Arabic prefix 'Al' which appears in numerous Surnames/ Family Names of people of Arab descent.    

Using the example above, MURUGAN A/L VELLUPILLAI would also arrange his name in such a way that his father's name become his initial and his given name appears to be his Surname/ Last Name: V. MURUGAN. This practice is similar to the name format of a very famous South Indian writer R. K. Narayan (R - Place of Origin: RASIPURAM , K - Father's Name: KRISHNASWAMI). Since most Malaysian Indians are today born in Malaysia, usually only the father's name appears as the initials. <!-- this isn't an article on RKN's family; R.K. Narayan's equally famous cartoonist brother is R. K. Laxman. -->

However an increasing number of Malaysian Indians are migrating to the West, and they have begun using their father's name as the Last Name to avoid confusion. Therefore, Murugan the son of Vellupillai would simply go as MURUGAN VELLUPILLAI or M. VELLUPILLAI in the West. Malaysian Indian females sometimes take their husband's given name as their Surname or Last Name.

==East and west Indian names==
====Bengali names====
In addition to a family name, many [[Bengali people|Bengalis]] (in both [[West Bengal]] and [[Bangladesh]]) have two given names: a ''bhalo nam'' (lit. "good name"), which is used on all legal documents, and a ''dak nam'' (lit. "call name"), which is used by family members and close friends. The two names may or may not be at all related; for example, a man named Deepak Biswas may be called by his ''dak nam'' (e.g. Bablu) at home and a his ''bhalo nam'' (Deepak) elsewhere. Many people also have a shortened version of their ''bhalo nam'' (e.g. Deepu for Deepak, Faru for Farhana, etc.) in addition to their full ''bhalo nam'' and their ''dak nam''. Recently, many Bengalis have begun to add their ''dak nam'' to the end of their full official name, resulting in names like Saifuddeen Chowdhury Kanchon, where "Saifuddeen" would be the man's ''bhalo nam'', "Chowdhury" would be his family name, and "Kanchon" would be his ''dak nam''. In these situations, this man would be correctly addressed "Mr. Chowdhury", not "Mr. Kanchon".

====Gujarati and Marathi names====
In [[Gujarat]] and  [[Maharashtra]] , the naming system is very similar to the first-middle-last format followed in the western world, i.e., "[[Sunil Gavaskar|Sunil Manohar Gavaskar]]."  Here, "Sunil" is the first name of the person, "Manohar" is the father's name, which is often abbreviated as an initial, and "Gavaskar" is the last or family name. Traditionally, women take their husband's name as their middle name, in addition to adopting his family name. In Maharashtra sometimes a male newborn is named after his grandfather's name. In Gujarat, people also add suffix to their names based on their gender. " Bhai" for Male and "Ben" for Female. e.g. Sunil is called Sunilbhai and Lata is called Lataben. Similar to the Gujarati way, Maharastrians address males as "Rao". e.g. Sunil will be called Sunilrao.
