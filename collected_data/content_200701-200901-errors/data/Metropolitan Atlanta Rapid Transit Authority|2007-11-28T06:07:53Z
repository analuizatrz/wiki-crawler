The '''Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority''' '''(MARTA)''', is the principal [[rapid transit|rapid-transit]] system in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]] and the ninth-largest in the [[United States]].  MARTA operates a network of [[bus route]]s linked to a [[heavy rail]] rapid transit system consisting of 48&nbsp;miles (77&nbsp;kilometers) of track with 38 [[train station]]s.  As of 2006, the system has an average weekday ridership of 451,064 passengers.  The MARTA acronym is pronounced as a single word, not as individual letters.

MARTA is funded and operated by the [[Atlanta, Georgia|City of Atlanta]], [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]] and [[DeKalb County, Georgia|DeKalb County]].  As a result the MARTA system only operates within the boundaries of Fulton County and DeKalb County, with additional limited bus service to [[Cobb County, Georgia|Cobb County]].  

MARTA is the largest [[United States]] transit agency not to receive [[U.S. state|state]] operational funding.  The other three largest counties in the metro Atlanta area, Cobb, [[Gwinnett County, Georgia|Gwinnett]], and [[Clayton County, Georgia|Clayton]], have refused to join or fund MARTA and as a result, all three have independent transit agencies which connect to MARTA.  The continued refusal of neighboring counties to participate and the lack of state funding for operation  has limited MARTA's ability to become a fully regional transportation system for Atlanta.{{fact|date=September 2007}}  

==History==
[[Image:Marta plan.png|thumb|Map of the initial plan of the MARTA system from the 1970s]]
{{Main|Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority History}}
MARTA was originally proposed as a rapid transit agency for the five largest [[Atlanta metropolitan area|metropolitan Atlanta]] counties:  [[DeKalb County, Georgia|DeKalb]], [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton]], [[Clayton County, Georgia|Clayton]], [[Gwinnett County, Georgia|Gwinnett]], and [[Cobb County, Georgia|Cobb]] counties.  MARTA was formed by an act of the [[Georgia General Assembly]] in 1965. In the same year, four of the five metropolitan area counties (Clayton, DeKalb, Fulton, and Gwinnett) and the [[Atlanta, Georgia|City of Atlanta]] passed a referendum authorizing participation in the system, but the referendum failed in Cobb County. Although a 1968 referendum to fund MARTA failed, in 1971, Fulton and DeKalb Counties successfully passed a 1% sales tax increase to pay for operations, while Clayton and Gwinnett counties overwhelmingly rejected the tax in referendum, fearing the introduction of crime and "undesirable elements".<ref name=bullard>{{cite book| author=Bullard, R. D. et al| year=2000| title=Sprawl City: Race, Politics, and Planning in Atlanta| location=Washington, D.C.| publisher=Island Press| pages=p52-59| isbn=1-55963-790-0}}</ref>  In 1971, the agency agreed to purchase the existing, bus-only [[Atlanta Transit Company]] and on [[February 17]], [[1972]] the sale was completed for [[United States dollar|US$]]12.9 million giving the agency control over all public transit.

Construction began on the MARTA system in 1975, with the first rail service commencing on [[June 30]], [[1979]].  The system has since built most of the proposed rail lines, as well as stations in [[Sandy Springs (MARTA station)|Sandy Springs]] and [[North Springs (MARTA station)|North Springs]] which were not included in the original plan.  The missing rail segments include a [[Tucker, Georgia|Tucker]]-North DeKalb line with service to [[Emory University]] and [[North Druid Hills, Georgia|North Druid Hills]], a Northwest line with service to [[Brookwood Hills|Brookwood]] and Northside Drive, extension of the West line to Brownlee-Boulder Park near Fairburn Road, extension of the Proctor Creek line to Perry Homes, and a branch off of the south line to [[Hapeville, Georgia|Hapeville]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://world.nycsubway.org/us/atlanta/marta-provisions.html| title=Marta Provisions for Future Expansions| work=Nycsubway.com }}</ref>

==MARTA system==
[[Image:MARTA Rail Map.svg|200px|left|Map of the MARTA rail system]]
MARTA is comprised of both heavy rail transit and bus transit that operate within the boundaries of [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton]] and [[DeKalb County, Georgia|DeKalb]] counties. A recent notable exception is that effective [[November 20]], [[2006]], MARTA is offering bus service to Cobb County's Cumberland Boulevard Transfer Center on one bus route.<ref>{{cite press release| url=http://www.itsmarta.com/newsroom/press_releases/rel.asp?id=179| title=MARTA's Bus Route 12 will provide extended service to the Cumberland Mall area| date=[[November 20]], [[2006]]| publisher=MARTA| }}</ref>  For fiscal year 2006, the average weekday ridership was 451,064. Overall for the year, bus and paratransit ridership was 69,194,285 while rail ridership was 69,209,027.<ref name=06anrep>{{cite web| url=http://www.itsmarta.com/about/annualreport/2006%20Annual%20Report(tabs).pdf| format=pdf| publisher=MARTA| title=2006 Annual Report| }}</ref>

As of 2005 MARTA had 4,300 employees including 1,085 full time bus drivers and 184 full time rail operators.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.itsmarta.com/about/MARTOC/martoc%20report%202005.rtf| format=rtf| title=2005 MARTOC report| }}</ref> Rail and bus operators, station agents, rail maintenance technicians and many other front line support personnel are represented by [[Amalgamated Transit Union]] Local 732.

[[Image:Marta police station.jpg|thumb|MARTA Police station at [[Lindbergh Center (MARTA station)|Lindbergh Center station]]]]
MARTA maintains its own [[police]] force, which is currently headed by Chief Wanda Dunham. MARTA has been named the safest transit system in the United States seventeen times.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.itsmarta.com/visitors/safety.htm| title=MARTA Visitor Safety| }}</ref>

===Heavy rail network===
{{main|List of MARTA stations}}
MARTA rail is comprised of four service lines, the [[List of MARTA stations#North-South & Northeast-South Lines|North-South line]] (red), [[List of MARTA stations#North-South & Northeast-South Lines|Northeast-South line]] (orange), [[List of MARTA stations#East-West & Proctor Creek Lines|East-West line]] (blue) and the [[List of MARTA stations#East-West & Proctor Creek Lines|Proctor Creek line]] (green).  Lines are conventionally referenced by terminating station (Airport, Doraville, North Springs, H. E. Holmes, Bankhead, King Memorial, Candler Park, Indian Creek) or direction, not color.  The "red" and "green" colors are new [[as of 2007]] published maps and do not exist in stations.  All stations on the North-South and Northeast-South lines use orange signage, and all stations on the East-West and Proctor Creek lines use blue signage.

All lines connect at the [[Five Points (MARTA station)|Five Points station]]. Trains are operated using [[Automatic Train Control]], with one MARTA train operator to make announcements and operate the doors.  Many [[suburb]]an stations offer designated free daily and paid long term parking in MARTA operated [[park and ride]] lots. These stations also have designated [[Park and ride#Kiss and ride|kiss ride]] passenger drop off parking spaces closest to the station entrance.

====Rolling stock====
[[Image:Marta 006.jpg|thumb|right|Interior of a MARTA CQ312 car]]
The MARTA rail car fleet is currently composed of three different classes of rail cars:<ref name=railcar>[http://www.itsmarta.com/newsroom/railrehab_facts.htm MARTA Rail Car Rehabilitation Media Kit]</ref>

* CQ310 class (118 active cars):
** Rail car numbers 101-200; built by Franco-Belge, 1979-1982
** Rail car numbers 501-520; built by Franco-Belge, 1979-1982, originally single unit cars.
* CQ311 class (120 active cars):  
**Rail car numbers 201-320; built by [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]], 1984-1987
* CQ312 class (100 active cars):
** Rail car numbers 601-702; built by [[Ansaldobreda, S.P.A.|Breda]], 2001-2005

MARTA has entered a contract with [[Alstom]] to rebuild all CQ310 and CQ311 cars (238 Rail Cars in total).  The rehabilitated cars will feature upgraded passenger amenities and upgraded propulsion and train control hardware. The first rehabilitated cars began service [[March 12]], [[2006]]. The refurbishing program will last until 2008-2009.<ref name=railcar/>

===Bus===
[[Image:Decatur 023.jpg|thumb|right|MARTA bus]]
[[Image:Marta bus stop.jpg|thumb|right|MARTA bus stop sign]]
[[Image:Midtown MARTA Bus.jpg|thumb|right|MARTA Bus in Midtown]]
MARTA's bus system serves a wider area than the rail system, serving areas in Fulton and DeKalb counties such as the cities of [[Roswell, Georgia|Roswell]] and [[Alpharetta]] in North Fulton, along with South DeKalb.  As of 2006, MARTA has 120 bus routes, including 5 blue flyer express shuttle routes.<ref name=06anrep/> Effective [[November 20]], [[2006]] MARTA now has one bus route providing limited service in Cobb County (Route 12 has been extended to Cobb County's Cumberland Boulevard Transfer Center).<ref>[http://www.itsmarta.com/newsroom/press_releases/rel.asp?id=179 November 20, 2006 MARTA Press Release]</ref><ref> [http://www.itsmarta.com/getthere/schedules/12.htm Howell Mill Bus Route]</ref> All of the MARTA bus lines feed into or intersect MARTA rail lines as well. MARTA also runs shuttles for special events, such as the [[Peachtree Road Race]] and [[Atlanta Braves]] [[baseball]] games. MARTA shuttle service is also available to [[Six Flags Over Georgia]] during the park's summer season.

In addition to the free parking adjacent to many rail stations, MARTA also operates [[Park and ride]] lots serviced only by bus routes:
* Windward Parkway
* Mansell Road
* Stone Mountain
* Barge Road
* South Fulton

For some time, MARTA had "secret" bus routes in the 700 series. These routes were designed to connect maids, home health care workers, and nannies from MARTA rail stations to their work sites. These routes were not officially noted in any system map except for a small footprint instructing people who needed transit service in that area to contact Customer Information.<ref>[http://groups.google.com/group/misc.transport.urban-transit/msg/2fdb62168f741ba0 MTUT story]</ref> No schedules were publicly distributed, and no information was published on the web site. In 1999, the routes were officially "declassified" and information was published. As part of system-wide service cuts, the 700 series routes were eliminated in 2002.<ref>[http://itsmarta.com/about/history05.htm MARTA announces route cuts]</ref>

===Paratransit service===
In compliance with the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans with Disabilities Act]], MARTA provides [[paratransit]] for those persons defined as disabled by the ADA.  MARTA uses special lift equipped vehicles for this service and can either deliver passengers to their final destination (curb to curb service) or can deliver the passenger to the closest accessible bus stop or rail station (feeder service).  In fiscal year 2006 MARTA provided 289,258 paratransit trips.<ref name=06anrep/>

The average cost to MARTA for providing a one way trip for an individual paratransit passenger is [[United States dollar|US$]]31.88.<ref>[http://www.gcdd.org/home/Plan/The%20GCDD%205%20Year%20Strategic%20Plan.rtf Georgia Governor's Council on Developmental Disabilities Five Year Strategic Plan]</ref> This is much greater than the [[United States dollar|US$]]3.50 fare the paratransit rider is required to pay. The Americans with Disabilities Act forbids MARTA from charging a paratransit fare more than twice the normal fixed route fare.

Paratransit is limited to existing rail and bus routes and cannot extend more than a 0.75&nbsp;mile (1.2&nbsp;kilometer) radius from any existing route. Paratransit service is only provided during the hours of the fixed route servicing the area. An application for acceptance into the paratransit service is required; reservations are required for all users for each trip.

==Fare structure and operation==
[[Image:Marta token.jpg|thumb|Example of a MARTA single one-way fare token; tokens have been replaced by MARTA's [[Breeze Card]]]]
MARTA offers both single one-way [[fare]]s (with free bus to rail and rail to bus transfers) and discounted weekly and monthly passes.
The fare structure is as follows:<ref>[http://www.itsmarta.com/howto/fares.htm MARTA Fares]</ref>
* Single one-way fare: [[United States dollar|US$]]1.75
* Single one-way paratransit fare: $3.50
* Ten (10) one-way trips: $17.50
* Twenty (20) one-way trips: $30.00
* 7-Day pass (7 consecutive days from first use): $13
* 30-Day pass (30 consecutive days from first use): $52.50
* Weekend pass (Friday-Sunday): $9

Discounted programs available to select users:
* University monthly pass (UPASS) program: $40 (Students) $49.50 (Faculty/Staff)
* Student weekly pass program: $10 (K-12 students in DeKalb and Fulton Counties)
* Half-fare program: $0.85 one-way (Passengers over 65 and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] recipients)

Special routes, such as the [[Atlanta Braves]] shuttle, and the [[Six Flags Over Georgia]] shuttle service, and the [[HiFi Buys Amphitheatre]] used to have an additional a surcharge for each one-way trip.  The surcharge was eliminated in 2007 for both the Braves shuttle and Six Flags shuttle, however a $1 surcharge remains for the Hi-Fi Buys shuttle.<ref>[http://www.itsmarta.com/getthere/shuttles.htm MARTA shuttles]</ref>

Effective January 2006, disabled riders who are paratransit eligible can ride fixed bus and rail routes for free.

Additional discounts are available to corporate partners who sell monthly MARTA passes to employees and also to groups and conventions visiting Atlanta. Some employers (at their own expense) also provide reduced cost or free MARTA passes to employees to encourage the use of public transportation.

===Breeze Card===
[[Image:Happymartacards.JPG|thumb|right|Examples of MARTA Transcards (monthly and weekly), Limited Use Breeze Ticket, and Extended Use Breeze Card]]
{{main|Breeze Card}}
MARTA has finished implementing the "Breeze" [[smart card]] electronic fare collection system in September 2006, replacing the previous [[Token coin|token]]-based fare collection system.  The new Breeze Card allows riders to load money on the card for use over time, and to add weekly/monthly passes that are not fixed to a calendar period. The system uses a two card scheme: the '''Limited-Use Ticket''' is used by people who are visiting and other light users, and is composed of coated paper around the [[Radio Frequency Identification|RFID]] antenna. The '''Extended-Use Card''' is meant for those who use MARTA frequently and need to load time-based passes.  The new Breeze fare gates are designed to help prevent [[Turnstile#Turnstile jumping|fare evasion]]; with the older fare collection system fare evasion was much easier and was estimated to cost MARTA $10 million per year.<ref>Donsky, Paul. MARTA Plugs Gap in New Station Gates ''Atlanta Journal Constitution'' February 22, 2006 pg 4B.</ref> Other connecting transit systems such as [[Georgia Regional Transportation Authority|GRTA Xpress]], [[Cobb Community Transit|CCT]] have adopted the infrastructure, and are currently building implementation plans.

On [[May 1]], [[2007]], MARTA began charging a $0.50 fee for issuing new Breeze Tickets.  Free Breeze Cards were available until [[July 1]], [[2007]], when a one-time $5 per card charge (Which includes two one-way trips) was implemented.<ref>http://www.itsmarta.com/newsroom/press_releases/rel.asp?id=219</ref>

MARTA stopped selling tokens after the Breeze conversion, but magnetic non-smart card weekly and monthly MARTA cards continue to be sold (until summer 2007). Tokens are no longer accepted as payment but can be transferred to a Breeze ticket, without incurring the $0.50 fee, at a Breeze ticketing machine.

===Hours of operation===
MARTA operates 365 days a year. Rail service is provided from approximately 5 a.m. to 1 a.m. Monday through Friday and 5 a.m. to 12:30 a.m. on weekends and holidays, and during certain events ([[New Year's  Eve]]) trains run 24 hours.  Weekday train frequency is 10 minutes on branch lines and 5 minute frequencies on trunk lines. Late night (after 7:00 pm) and weekend frequency is reduced, with train frequencies of 15-20 minutes on all lines. Bus routes have varying frequencies depending on passenger demand.

===Fare reciprocity===
Through formal fare reciprocity agreements, MARTA riders are able to transfer for free to four other metro Atlanta transit systems:  [[Gwinnett County Transit]], [[Cobb Community Transit]], [[Clayton County C-TRAN]], and [[Georgia Regional Transportation Authority|GRTA Xpress]]. Some of these agreements require that neither system have significantly more transfers than the other. MARTA has stated that this is the case, that inbound (to MARTA from another system) and outbound (from MARTA to another system) transfers are approximately equal (for second quarter 2006 8,888 daily passengers transferred inbound and 8,843 transferred outbound).<ref name=boardmin>[http://www.itsmarta.com/board/minutes/Customer%20Development%203_20_2006.doc MARTA Customer Development Committee Minutes, March 20, 2006]</ref> However, it has been noted that workers traveling in the morning to Atlanta from another system will more than likely make the return trip home, resulting in the appearance of an equal number of transfers. Analysis of morning transfers (5 to 9 am) to MARTA shows that Cobb County had 718 inbound transfers but only 528 outbound, Clayton county had 928 inbound but only 424 outbound, Gwinnett County had 239 inbound and 269 outbound, and GRTA Xpress had 1,175 inbound but 615 outbound.).<ref name=boardmin/> These data suggest that more people from the other systems benefit from free transfers than those living in the MARTA service area.

*Browns Mill Maintenance Facility (Browns Mill Rd SE & Hamilton Blvd NW)

==MARTA funding==
In addition to fare collections, the MARTA budget is funded by a 1% [[sales tax]] in [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton]] and [[DeKalb County, Georgia|DeKalb]] counties along with limited [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] money. By law, funds from the 1% sales tax must be split evenly between MARTA's operational and [[Capital (economics)|capital]] expenditure budgets. This restriction does not apply to other sources of revenue, including passenger revenue.<ref name=06martoc>[http://www.itsmarta.com/about/MARTOC/2006MARTOCREPORT(web).pdf 2006 MARTOC Report]</ref> The split was written into MARTA legislation at MARTA's formation with the rationale that MARTA should continue expanding and investing in the system. However, MARTA has no active rail construction projects; as a result the capital funds enjoy a large surplus whereas the operations funds limit the amount of service MARTA provides. The sales tax law was amended by the state legislature in 2002 to allow a temporary three year 45% capital/55% operations split.<ref>[http://www.itsmarta.com/about/history05.htm Marta History]</ref> This additional 5% for operations expired in 2005. A 2005 bill to renew the split was tabled by the legislature's MARTA Oversight Committee, forcing MARTA to pass a new budget with cuts in service. In addition a fare increase was considered; however, MARTA board members voted down a fare increase and instead used cash reserves to make up for the operations shortfall. The temporary 45%/55% capital/operations split was renewed again in the 2006 state legislative session. The capital funds surplus has resulted in projects, such as a new [[United States dollar|US$]]100 million [[Breeze Card]] fare collection system and [[United States dollar|US$]]1.1 million automatic [[toilet]]s in the MARTA Five Points station, occurring at the same time that MARTA is struggling to pay for bus and rail operations.<ref>Donksy, Paul.  MARTA flushes in new era with 12 self-cleaning toilets.  ''Atlanta Journal Constitution'' July 19, 2006.</ref>

The current 1% sales tax was set to be reduced to 0.5% in 2032.  In early 2007 MARTA made a request to the City of Atlanta, DeKalb County, and Fulton County to seek a 15 year extension of the 1% sales tax from 2032 to 2047, with a 0.5% sales tax from 2047 to 2057.<ref name=tax1>Donsky, Paul.

To approve the tax extension 2 of the 3 government agences must agree to the extension.  In March 2007 the City of Atlanta voted 12-1 to approve the extension.<ref name=tax1/>  In April 2007 the DeKalb County Commission also approved the sales tax extension.<ref>Donsky, Paul.

MARTA has never received any operational funding from the State of Georgia, making it the largest public transportation agency in the United States not to receive state funding for operational expenses.<ref name=cloaf>Wall, Michael.

Two of Metro Atlanta's inner suburban counties, [[Gwinnett County, Georgia|Gwinnett]], and [[Clayton County, Georgia|Clayton]] initially agreed to join MARTA but refused membership when voters in their respective counties voted against paying to help fund the system. These two counties along with [[Cobb County, Georgia|Cobb County]] have instead created their own independent bus systems: [[Cobb Community Transit]] on [[July 10]], [[1989]], [[Gwinnett County Transit]] on [[November 5]], [[2001]] , and [[Clayton County C-TRAN]] on [[October 1]], [[2001]]. A separate regional bus transit service, Xpress, is operated by the [[Georgia Regional Transportation Authority]] in partnership with 11 metro Atlanta counties including Fulton and DeKalb, which began service on [[June 6]], [[2004]].

==MARTA governance==
MARTA is governed by a [[Board of directors]] consisting of the following members:
* Four members representing the [[Atlanta, Georgia|City of Atlanta]]
** Juanita Jones Abernathy
** Clara H. Axam
** Gloria Leonard
** Michael Walls
* Five members representing [[DeKalb County, Georgia|DeKalb County]]
** Harold Buckley, Sr.
** J. Thomas Kilpatrick
** Mukesh "Mike" Patel
** Pat Upshaw-Monteith
** Edmund J. Wall
* Three members representing [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]]
** Barbara Babbit Kaufman
** Walter L. Kimbrough, L.H.D.
** Marie R. Metze, Ph.D.
* One member representing [[Clayton County, Georgia|Clayton County]]
** George E. Glaze
* One member representing [[Gwinnett County, Georgia|Gwinnett County]]
** Bruce E. Le'Vell
* Four ex officio members from different [[Georgia (U.S. state)|State of Georgia]] committees:
** State Properties Commission & Georgia Building Authority - Gena Abraham
** Georgia Department of Revenue - Bart L. Graham
** [[Georgia Department of Transportation]] - Harold E. Linnenkohl
** [[Georgia Regional Transportation Authority]] - Steve Stancil
Positions on the MARTA Board of Directors are directly appointed by the organizations they represent. Although the state of Georgia does not contribute to MARTA's operational fuding, it still has voting members on the MARTA board. A similar situation exists for both Clayton and Gwinnett counties; as a consequence of passing the authorization referendum but not the funding referendum, Clayton and Gwinnett Counties have representation on the MARTA Board of Directors without paying into the system. This situation became controversial in 2004 when Gwinnett's representative Mychal Walker was found to have accepted [[United States dollar|US$]]20,000 from a lobbyist trying to secure a [[United States dollar|US$]]100,000,000 contract with MARTA. Despite the controversy, as well as a MARTA board ruling that Walker violated the MARTA ethics policy, the Gwinnett County Commission initially failed to remove Mr. Walker from his position on the MARTA Board.<ref>Hairston, Julie.  Transit board member back on job after ethics trouble; status unclear.  ''Atlanta Journal Constitution'' November 30, 2004.</ref> Eventually the state legislature was called upon to change the law governing MARTA's Board to allow for the removal of a member whose appointing county did not act on a request for removal.<ref>Hairston, Julie.

Another board member controversy occurred March 13, 2007, when Chairman of the MARTA board, Edmund Wall, was arrested at [[Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport]] for [[Indecent exposure|public indecency]] on allegations of having sex with a man he met over the Internet in a bathroom stall. Wall claims he is innocent of the misdemeanor charge.<ref>Associated Press.

The highest employee at MARTA is the General Manager/CEO. In September 2006, Richard McCrillis was named the new General Manager after having served since January 2006 as Interim General Manager.

The [[Georgia General Assembly]] has a standing [[MARTA Oversight Committee]], which is frequently abbreviated MARTOC. This committee is charged with financial oversight of the MARTA organization. State legislation concerning MARTA must pass through this committee. The current chairperson of the committee is Representative Jill Chambers.

==Performance==
All performance data are for the 2005 fiscal year:<ref>[http://www.itsmarta.com/about/annualreport/fy05ar.pdf MARTA FY2005 Annual Report]</ref>
* Customer Satisfaction: 79%
* Rail Mean Distance Between Service Interruptions: 9,493&nbsp;miles (15,274&nbsp;kilometers)
* Rail On Time Performance:  91.64%
* Bus Mean Distance Between Failures:  3,301&nbsp;miles (5,311&nbsp;kilometers)

===Safety===
MARTA has had two fatal accidents which resulted in a formal investigation by the [[National Transportation Safety Board]]:

* On [[February 25]], [[2000]] a train near [[Avondale (MARTA station)|Avondale station]] struck two automatic train control technicians who were inspecting a relay box; one was fatally injured and the other technician suffered serious injuries.  The workers had failed to apply for a safe clearance restriction for the track work.  In addition, the rail system center controller, who was aware of the workers, failed to notify train drivers of the technicians' presence.<ref>[http://www.ntsb.gov/publictn/2003/RAB0303.htm NTSB Abstract RAB-03/03] Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) train 103 striking technicians fouling the track Near MARTA Avondale Station in Decatur, Georgia February 25, 2000</ref>

[[Image:Marta accident.jpg|thumb|April 2000 MARTA accident at [[Lenox (MARTA station)|Lenox station]]]]
* On [[April 10]], [[2000]] a train struck a bucket lift containing two contract workers at [[Lenox (MARTA station)|Lenox station]]; the workers were fatally injured.  Although the MARTA employee who was accompanying the workers notified the rail control center of the work over the track, the control center employee failed to block off the section of the track in the automated rail control system and also failed to notify the unscheduled southbound train of the workers presence.<ref>[http://www.ntsb.gov/publictn/2003/RAB0302.htm NTSB Abstract RAB-03/02] Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) Unscheduled train 166 striking bucket of self-propelled lift containing two contract workers MARTA Lenox rail transit station in Atlanta, Georgia April 10, 2000, about 2:30 a.m.</ref>  In 2001 MARTA settled with the families of the two killed workers for [[United States dollar|US$]]10.5 million.<ref>Ippolito, Milo.  MARTA pays $10.5 million in workers' deaths.  ''Atlanta Journal Constitution''  December 5, 2001.</ref>

In addition to these accidents MARTA trains have derailed four times in recent years.  The most recent incident occurred at the [[Medical Center (MARTA station)|Medical Center station]] on [[December 4]], [[2006]] when a train carrying passengers was moved over a switched portion of the track.  No injuries were reported.<ref>Donsky and Morris.

A paired car on a train which had developed mechanical problems was uncoupled from other cars at [[Indian Creek (MARTA station)|Indian Creek station]] (the last station on the east line).  The train began rolling, crashing through the bumper at the end of the rail line and running off of the track.  The train operator, the only person on board, received minor injuries.<ref>Monroe, Doug.  MARTA driver injured when two cars derail.

Approximately 20 passengers were on board and no one was injured.<ref name=accident/>

==Future expansion plans==
{{future usa public transportation}}
Currently MARTA has one expansion project in the design phase:
* '''Memorial Bus Rapid Transit''': Implementation of bus rapid transit from the former [[Avondale Mall]] to the MARTA Park and Ride Lot in [[Stone Mountain, Georgia|Stone Mountain]]. This project has cleared the environmental study stage (the [[Federal Transit Administration]] issued the project a Finding of No Significant Impact in December 2006).  The project is now in the engineering design and right of acquisition phase, with an implementation of revenue service in early 2009.<ref>[http://www.itsmarta.com/newsroom/Memorial_BRT.html MARTA Memorial Drive Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Project]</ref>

Additionally, several traffic corridors are currently being studied by MARTA for possible system expansion:
[[Image:Beltline-breaks.png|thumb|right|Map showing Belt Line and connected [[List of Atlanta neighborhoods|neighborhoods]]]]
* '''[[Belt Line (Atlanta)|Belt Line]]''': The use of light rail and possibly bus or trolley service on existing railroad right of ways inside the [[Interstate 285|perimeter]].<ref>[http://www.itsmarta.com/newsroom/beltline.html MARTA Beltline Corridor Study]</ref> The conversion of existing rail right-of-way to the proposed Belt Line also calls for the creation of three additional MARTA rapid transit stations where existing lines intersect the Belt Line at Simpson Road, Hulsey Yard, and Murphy Crossing.
* '''North Line Expansion''': Potential construction of 11 miles (18 km) of additional heavy rail from [[North Springs (MARTA station)|North Springs]] station to Windward Parkway.<ref>[http://www.itsmarta.com/newsroom/northline.htm MARTA North Line Corridor Study]</ref> Extension of the North line is estimated to cost [[United States dollar|US$]]100 million per mile.<ref name=tax3/><br />Potential Sites (along [[GA 400|near GA 400]]):<ref>Kaplan, Paul.

* '''I-20 East Corridor''': Bus rapid transit from downtown Atlanta to the [[Mall at Stonecrest]]<ref>[http://www.itsmarta.com/newsroom/i20east.htm MARTA I-20 East Corridor Study]</ref>
* '''Clifton Corridor ([[C-loop]])''' Enhanced service between [[Lindbergh Center (MARTA station)|Lindbergh Center]] and [[Emory University]]<ref>[http://www.itsmarta.com/newsroom/planstudy.htm MARTA Planning Studies]</ref>

Additional expansion plans for MARTA and other metro Atlanta transportation agencies are detailed in [[Mobility 2030 (Atlanta)|Mobility 2030]] a timeline by the [[Atlanta Regional Commission]] for improving transit through the year 2030.

==Criticism and concern==
===Financial support===
Since the formation of MARTA, the Georgia state government has never contributed to MARTA operational funding.  Currently, MARTA is the largest mass transportation system in the United States not to receive state funding.<ref name=cloaf/>  Revenue from the Georgia motor [[fuel tax]] is currently restricted to roads and bridges and cannot be used for public transportation, further complicating potential sources of state funding for MARTA.<ref name=bullard/>  In addition, many other suburban counties, such as [[Gwinnett County, Georgia|Gwinnett]], [[Henry County, Georgia|Henry]], [[Cherokee County, Georgia|Cherokee]], [[Douglas County, Georgia|Douglas]], [[Clayton County, Georgia|Clayton]], and [[Cobb County, Georgia|Cobb]] counties, have refused to join or fund MARTA in any way (see history, above).  

While some of the reasons behind their refusal can be attributed to MARTA's service difficiencies, many people will also attribute it to racial/socio-economic overtones that the metro area has never truly gotten over throughout its history;  MARTA's service area includes some of Atlanta's most economically depressed and high crime neighborhoods.  Many of the residents from surrounding areas simply avoid taking MARTA to avoid the residents from the inner city that are usually dependent on MARTA in order to get them to and from work.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}  In many cases, residents from these areas object to the expansion of MARTA into their neighborhoods and counties despite pressure from the state and federal government to comply with [[Clean Air Act]] guidelines.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}  As a result the surrounding counties have decided to implement a bus transit service of their own rather than have MARTA operate their public transportation.  

Due to its limited funding from [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton]] and [[DeKalb County, Georgia|DeKalb]] counties, MARTA has struggled for many years to provide adequate service to the metropolitan area.  As a result, MARTA has gained a notorious reputation throughout the metro Atlanta area for being ineffective and inconvenient. Many people who own cars avoid using the system altogether while residents in suburban areas usually drive to a MARTA station if their job is near an adjacent one.  MARTA's financial structure (being tied to a 1% sales tax) has forced the agency to cut services during times of economic depression, further resulting in complaints about the inconvenience and inadequacy of MARTA services.

Although surrounding counties do not pay for MARTA, many of their residents use MARTA by driving directly to a MARTA station or by using a county or regional bus system which connects to MARTA.  A license plate study from 1988 to 1997 showed that 44 percent of the cars parked in MARTA park-and-ride lots were from outside of Fulton and DeKalb counties.<ref name=bullard/>  Current fare reciprocity agreements also allow non-paying counties to provide bus service for their residents which provide free connections to MARTA (see fare reciprocity).  Sixteen percent of MARTA riders live outside of DeKalb and Fulton counties while over 55 percent of their ridership are transit-dependent (do not have the means to buy/maintain a car).<ref name=bullard/>

===Racial concern===
It is often argued that racial politics also play a role in the operation and future service planning for MARTA. The MARTA [[acronym]] is sometimes referred to as "Moving Africans Rapidly Through Atlanta," a replacement [[backronym]], due to the relatively low number of [[White people|White]], [[Hispanic]], or other Non-African American riders in general, particularly after peak commuting hours.<ref>McCosh, John.  MARTA calls on marketers for image aid; Can soft drinks fill empty seats?  ''Atlanta Journal Constitution''  February 11, 2001.</ref> A 1999 MARTA rider survey revealed that 78 percent of MARTA riders are [[African American]].<ref name=bullard/>  As mentioned before, Cobb and Gwinnett counties initially rejected MARTA at inception and to this day, some predominantly White suburban communities have opposed MARTA expansions, believing it will be a pipeline to bring unwelcome minorities and/or crime from the city of Atlanta into their [[communities]]. Many Caucasian riders also express their unhappiness and discontent with the MARTA rail line due to perceptions that they are the most common or preferred targets for being accosted by [[panhandler]]s and/or being potentially robbed in or around MARTA stations themselves. 

Opponents of Georgia's transportation policies have alleged a race-based two-tiered system, where billions are spent by the state to aid commutes of mostly Caucasian residents of the suburbs, while service cuts at MARTA have hurt mostly African Americans.<ref name=cloaf/>

===Reliability of Service===
[[Image:Marta construction.jpg|thumb|MARTA construction at [[Peachtree Center (MARTA station)|Peachtree Center]]]]
As is typical of rail transit in the United States, MARTA's rail lines have two [[Double track|parallel tracks]]. Any train failure or track work results in shared use of the other track by trains going opposite direction, a situation known as [[Single-line working|single-tracking]]. There are no plans at this time to expand the number of tracks. MARTA is currently nearing the end of a complete replacement of tracks on all rail lines. Over the past few years, this replacement work has caused the agency to implement single-tracking on the weekends, which in turn has caused weekend patrons to experience less frequent service.

In the Summer of 2006, as a result of high summertime temperatures, many MARTA rail cars became overheated, damaging onboard propulsion equipment. As a result many trains broke down and had to be taken out of service for repair. This was further compounded by the fact that at any given time up to 50 older rail cars are out of service as part of MARTA's rail car rehabilitation project. To compensate for fewer cars MARTA shortened trains from 6 cars to 4 cars in length. Sometimes this resulted in almost half of the trains being shortened, resulting in crowded conditions for passengers.<ref>Donsky, Paul.  MARTA riders crowd heat-diminished fleet.  ''Atlanta Journal Constitution'' September 12, 2006.</ref> The breakdowns and overcrowded conditions may have contributed to a drop in customer satisfaction in the most recent customer survey (72% were very satisfied or satisfied with MARTA, a 7% decline from the prior survey).<ref>Harris, Lyle.  OUR OPINIONS; MARTA needs to focus on results.  ''Atlanta Journal Constitution'' September 19, 2006.</ref>

===Governance===
The composition of the MARTA Board of Directors is also criticized. The State of Georgia, Gwinnett and Clayton Counties do not support MARTA financially, but still have positions on the MARTA Board of Directors. Additional criticisms of the MARTA Board is that they are not elected, and thus not accountable to the citizens whom they represent. Furthermore, the Board members are also criticized for not being regular users of MARTA and thus are not actually aware of the concerns of MARTA commuters.

As the metropolitan area grows the [[Georgia Department of Transportation]] has looked to greater road infrastructure to manage traffic problems. Most notably, a proposal for the widening of [[Interstate 75|I-75]] will put up to 23 lanes of traffic into the city. The city of [[Atlanta]], however, has started a push for new mass transportation systems, such as a proposed [[Belt Line (Atlanta)|Belt Line]] and a streetcar line up [[Peachtree Street]]. The [[Georgia Department of Transportation]] even plans to build a commuter rail line from Lovejoy, Georgia to Atlanta, and there is considerable support for an Athens-Atlanta line dubbed the Brain Train because it will connect the [[University of Georgia]], [[Emory University]], [[Georgia State University]] and the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]]. Several people have called for a new metropolitan planning committee to manage transportation, but for the time being transportation planning is split among different county and state agencies.

===Misuse of MARTA funds by employees for personal expenses===
In 2006 internal and external audits of MARTA corporate spending revealed personal charges on a pair of MARTA credit cards used by former General Manager and CEO Nathaniel Ford and two of his secretaries.  Ford charged nearly [[United States dollar|US$]]150,000 over his five years tenure at MARTA on the cards.<ref name="MARTA_$$$_BIZ_ATL">{{cite web |url=http://atlanta.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2006/08/21/story3.html?t=printable | title=Ex-MARTA CEO abused credit cards | publisher=Atlanta Business Chronicle | author=Ryan Mahoney | date=2006-08-18 | accessdate=2006-10-27 }}</ref> Ford stated that many of the charges were business-related expenses such as meals and drinks at restaurants and trips to industry conventions across the country.  But other charges were clearly not business related, including $454.00 at a golf pro shop, $335.00 in clothing from [[Men's Wearhouse]] and a $58.00 visit to the dentist.<ref name="MARTA_$$$_BIZ_ATL"/> MARTA determined Ford had previously reimbursed the authority for about $10,500.00 in personal expenses charged to the cards. In response to the 2006 audit, Ford sent MARTA a check for an additional $1,000.00 of personal expenses.<ref name="MARTA_$$$_BIZ_ATL"/> Rick Simonetta, MARTA's general manager from 1994 through 1999, also used the cards, but that use was never a problem according to Ed Wall, chairman of the MARTA board.<ref name="MARTA_$$$_BIZ_ATL"/> Additional credit card with charges involving two of his secretaries, Iris Anthony and Stephannie Smart were also questioned. Smart used the cards to pay approximately $6000.00 in private expenses, and has agreed to repay this amount to MARTA. Both Ms Smart and Ms Anthony left MARTA shortly before Mr Ford resigned.<ref name="MARTA_$$$_BIZ_ATL"/>
