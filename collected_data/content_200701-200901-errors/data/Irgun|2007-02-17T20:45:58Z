'''Irgun''' (ארגון), shorthand for '''Irgun Tsvai Leumi''' (ארגון צבאי לאומי, also spelled '''Irgun Zvai Leumi'''), [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] for "National Military Organization", was a clandestine militant [[Zionism|Zionist]] group that operated in [[Palestine (mandate)|Palestine]] from 1931 to 1948.  In Israel, this group is commonly referred to as '''Etzel''' (אצ"ל), an acronym of the Hebrew initials. In the time in which the Irgun operated, often people referred to the Irgun as 'הגנה ב or ההגנה הלאומית.  As the armed expression of the nascent ideology of [[Revisionist Zionism]], it was a political predecessor movement to Israel's [[right-wing]] ''[[Herut]]'' (or "Freedom") party.

== Founding, development and key events ==
The group was an offshoot of the [[Haganah]] in protest both against its policy of restraint and [[socialist]] leanings. Based on the premises formulated by [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]] that "every [[Jew]] had the right to enter [[British Mandate of Palestine|Palestine]]; only active retaliation would deter the [[Arab]]s and the [[United Kingdom|British]]; only Jewish armed force would ensure the Jewish state," (Howard Sachar: A ''History of the State of Israel'', pps 265-266) the group made retaliation against Arab attacks a central part of their initial efforts. The [[Jewish Agency]] denounced the existence, strategy, and tactics of the group from the very outset, although the Haganah cooperated with Irgun on several occasions.

Irgun was founded in 1931 by [[Avraham Tehomi]], following a largely political and ideological split with the [[Haganah]] after he had assumed leadership over the district of [[Jerusalem]]. Irgun differentiated itself from the Haganah by disassociating from the socialist ideology and the prevalent strategy of ''[[Havlagah]]'', or restraint. Throughout its history Irgun advocated a more decisive use of force in the defense of Jews in Mandate Palestine and in advancing the formation of a Jewish state. 

While the strategy, tactics, and operational methods of the organization changed through the years, its primary goals were to:

* Provide a non-Socialist alternative to the leading Zionist organizations;
* Eliminate or reduce the threat of Arab attacks on Jewish targets by assured and harsh retaliation for such attacks;
* Bring to an end the British mandatory rule, which they considered in violation of international law

The group went through several phases in its short lifespan:
* From 1931 to 1937 it was a small, renegade group that undertook scattered attacks against Arab targets.  This phase ended when the group itself split, with some of its leaders, including the original founder, Tehomi, returning to the Haganah, and the group began formally identifying itself as "Etzel" (Irgun).
* During the [[1936-1939 Arab revolt in Palestine]], in which about 320 [[Jew]]s were killed in Arab attacks, Irgun resumed its reprisal attacks against Arabs. Following the killing of five Jews at [[Kibbutz Kiryat Anavim]] on [[November 9]], [[1937]], Irgun launched a [[List of Irgun attacks during the 1930s|series of attacks]] which lasted until the beginning of [[World War II]], in which more than 250 Arabs were killed.
* These attacks coincided roughly with Irgun's campaign to facilitate the immigration of European Jews who faced discrimination, murder and pogroms in Europe. The first vessel arrived on [[April 13]], [[1937]], and the last on [[February 13]], [[1940]]. All told, about 18,000 Jews left Europe in this way.
* Upon the publication of the [[1939 White Paper|White Paper]] in May of 1939, Irgun concentrated all its efforts against the British.
* From 1940 through 1943, Irgun declared a truce against the British, and supported Allied efforts against Nazi forces and their allies in the area by enlisting its members in British forces and the [[Jewish Brigade]]. A small group lead by [[Avraham Stern]], who insisted on continuing to fight the British, broke off and formed an independent group, [[Lehi]]. In 1941, the Irgun leader, [[David Raziel]] volunteered for a dangerous British military mission in [[Iraq]] to capture or kill [[Amin al-Husayni]], but was killed by a [[Luftwaffe|German bomber]] before the operation could be finished.
* In February of 1944, under the new leadership of [[Menachem Begin]], who would later become prime minister of Israel, Irgun resumed hostilities against the British authorities. The purpose of these attacks was to increase the cost of British mandatory rule and influence British public opinion so as to encourage British withdrawal. It included attacks on prominent symbols of the British administration, including the [[British army|British military]], police, and civil headquarters at the [[King David Hotel bombing|King David Hotel]] on July 22, 1946 which killed 91 people and the British prison in [[Acre, Israel|Acre]]. Although these attacks were largely successful, several Irgun operatives were captured, convicted, and hanged. Refusing to accept the jurisdiction of the British courts, those accused refused to defend themselves. The Irgun leadership ultimately responded to these executions by hanging two British sergeants, which effectively brought the executions to an end.
*The extremist [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] group assassinated [[Lord Moyne]] in Cairo 1944. The two assassins, Eliyahu Hakim and Eliyahu Beit-Zouri were captured and executed. Though the Irgun joined the Jewish community of Palestine in condemning the murder, the Zionist leadership demanded that both separatist underground movements immediately disband. The Irgun refused. The Haganah initiated what is known as the ''Saison'' "[[The Hunting Season]]", in which it attempted to paralyze Irgun activity by arresting its members and turning them over to the British. Though many captured Irgun members were tortured, and some deported and even executed, Menachem Begin forbid them to fight the Haganah forces. The Irgun's costly determination to place the concern for national unity over the concern for its fighting ability or even the safety of its members gradually raised sympathies for the marginalized group, and serious disputes within the Haganah command. All in all, over 1000 members of the Irgun and Lechi were arrested and interred in British camps during the ''Saison''. Several hundred were deported to camps in Kenya and Eritrea.
* From about October of 1945 until July 1946, Irgun was in an alliance with the Haganah and Lehi called the Jewish resistance movement (תנועת המרי העברי), organized to fight British restrictions on Jewish immigration. The Haganah's active participation in the Resistance Movement ended as a result of [[Operation Agatha]], and it formally abandoned the alliance following the Irgun bombing of British military, police, and civil headquarters at the King David Hotel which was a retaliation for the Agatha raid.
* From July 1946 until June 1948, Irgun fought as irregulars against the British mandate and Arab forces, informally in coordination with Haganah forces. Their participation in [[massacre]] at [[Deir Yassin]] , which  accelerated the Arab exodus from Palestine on the eve of the founding of Israel<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/events/israel_at_50/profiles/81305.stm</ref>, has been widely discussed and documented.  Their largest single operation was the [[Seizure of Jaffa]] (an Arab city according to the U.N. partition plan) starting on April 25.  A thriving city of some 55,000 residents at the time of the Irgun assault, Jaffa would have some 4,100 Arab residents by the end of major hostilities
* In 1948, the group was formally dissolved and its members integrated into the newly formed [[Israeli Defense Forces]]. This integration largely coincided with the sinking of the [[Altalena Affair|Altalena]], a ship with fighters Irgun had recruited and arms Irgun had acquired for the Israeli forces.

== Views about Irgun ==

Views about the Irgun have been as disparate as any other political topic in Israel society.  Leaders within the mainstream [[Jewish Agency]], [[Haganah]], [[Histadrut]], as well as British authorities, routinely condemned (publicly at least; privately the Haganah kept a dialogue with the dissident groups) Irgun operations as [[Terrorism|terrorist]] and branded it an illegal organization [http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/72/a5211172.shtml] as a result of the group's attacks on [[List of Irgun attacks during the 1930s|civilian targets]].

The Irgun was also described as "terrorist" in a 1948 letter to the editor of the ''[[New York Times]]'' signed by [[Albert Einstein]], [[Hannah Arendt]], [[Sidney Hook]] and several other prominent Jews condeming a visit to the United States by Menachem Begin in 1948 after he had become leader of the new ''[[Herut]]'' party.<ref>[http://www.jfjfp.org/BackgroundN/einstein_et_al.htm New Palestine Party Visit of Menachem Begin and Aims of Political Movement Discussed] (Letter to the Editor by Albeert Einstein, Hannah Arendt, Sidney Hook and signed by several other prominent Jews) New York Times, December 4, 1948</ref>

==Radio station==
The Irgun had, from 1939, a [[Radio station]]: [[Kol Tsion HaLokhemet]] ("The Voice of Fighting Zion").
