'''Jimmy Nail''' is a [[Briton|British]] [[actor]] and [[singer]] (born [[March 16]], [[1954]], Gleneagles Close, [[Benton, Newcastle upon Tyne]]). He is famous for his rugged looks, hit singles and a strong [[Geordie]] accent. 

==Biography==
The son of James Bradford and Laura Johnson, his birth name was '''James Michael Aloysius Bradford'''. He was brother to two sisters: Shelagh (who died in June 1967) and [[Val McLane]], who starred with him in the second series of [[Auf Wiedersehen Pet]] playing Norma Patterson. Nail currently lives in Florida with his wife Miriam and two sons.
He rose to fame playing Leonard Jeffrey 'Oz' Osborne in ''[[Auf Wiedersehen, Pet]]'' in [[1983]], despite having minimal acting experience (he had appeared as an extra in the movie [[Get Carter]]). He was on his way to collect his [[social security]] benefit when he passed the [[audition]] centre and was spotted by writers [[Dick Clement]] and [[Ian La Frenais]] who immediately approached him and asked if he could act. Nail was helped through the process of basic acting and acquiring [[Equity]] status, and landed the part of Oz, for which he gained great acclaim.

Jimmy Nail has also starred in a number of films and had a long musical career, having been a singer before he was picked out at an audition to play Oz.

After the first two series of ''Auf Wiedersehen, Pet'', Nail found himself typecast and had no more major breaks until the detective series, ''[[Spender]]'', which he co-wrote.  This was followed by ''[[Crocodile Shoes]]'', which also featured Nail as a musician. On the strength of his musical performances in the series he released a number of albums. [[Mark Knopfler]] plays guitar on some tracks, a compliment that was repaid with an important plot reference to Oz's being a fan of [[Dire Straits]] in the third (revived) series of ''Auf Wiedersehen, Pet'' ([[2002]]).

Nail's unusual name stems from the time when he was walking along the street, thinking how he could shorten his name to be more 'media friendly'. As he was thinking about this, he stood on a nail, hence his name. 

Although it has not been 100% confirmed by his publicist it is strongly rumoured that Jimmy Nail was once famously denied access to Japan because he was "Too Ugly."
