The '''United States of America''' is a [[constitutional republic|constitutional]] [[federal republic]] comprising [[U.S. state|fifty states]] and a [[Capital districts and territories|federal district]]. The country is situated mostly in central [[North America]], where its [[Continental United States|forty-eight contiguous states]] and [[Washington, D.C.]], the capital district, lie between the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] and [[Atlantic Ocean]]s, bordered by [[Canada]] to the [[Canada – United States border|north]] and [[Mexico]] to the [[United States–Mexico border|south]]. The state of [[Alaska]] is in the northwest of the continent, with Canada to its east and [[Russia]] to the west across the [[Bering Strait]], and the state of [[Hawaii]] is in the mid-Pacific. The United States also possesses [[Territories of the United States|several territories]], or [[insular area]]s, scattered around the [[Caribbean]] and Pacific.

== Etymology ==
The term ''[[Americas#Naming|America]]'', for the lands of the [[Western Hemisphere|western hemisphere]], was coined in the early sixteenth century after [[Amerigo Vespucci]], an Italian explorer and cartographer. The full name of the country was first used officially in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], which was the "unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America" adopted by the "Representatives of the united States of America" on [[July 4]], [[1776]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov/national-archives-experience/charters/charters_downloads.html|title=The Charters of Freedom|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=2007-06-20}}</ref> The current name was finalized on [[November 15]], [[1777]], when the [[Second Continental Congress]] adopted the [[Articles of Confederation]], the first of which states, "The Stile of this Confederacy shall be 'The United States of America.'" Common short forms and abbreviations of the United States of America include the ''United States,'' the ''U.S.'', the ''U.S.A.'', and ''America''. Colloquial names for the country include the ''U.S. of A.'' and ''the States''. ''[[Columbia (name)|Columbia]]'', a once popular name for the Americas and the United States, was derived from [[Christopher Columbus]]. It appears in the name "[[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]". A female personification of Columbia appears on some official documents, including certain prints of [[United States dollar|U.S. currency]].

The standard way to refer to a citizen of the United States is as an ''[[American (word)|American]].'' Though ''United States'' is the formal adjective, ''American'' and ''U.S.'' are the most common adjectives used to refer to the country ("American values," "U.S. forces"). ''American'' is rarely used in English to refer to people not connected to the United States.<ref>Wilson, Kenneth G. (1993). ''The Columbia Guide to Standard American English''. New York: Columbia University Press, pp. 27–28. ISBN 0231069898.</ref>

The phrase "the United States" was originally treated as plural—e.g, "the United States are"—including in the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] to the Constitution, ratified in 1865. However, it became common usage to treat the name as singular—e.g., "the United States is"—after the Civil War, and there was discomfort with the plural before that. The plural form is retained in the set idiom "these United States."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002663.html|author=Zimmer, Benjamin|date=[[2005-11-24]]|title=Life in These, Uh, This United States|publisher=University of Pennsylvania—Language Log|accessdate=2008-02-22}}</ref>

== States ==
{{main|U.S. state}}

The United States is a [[federation|federal union]] of fifty states. The original thirteen states were the successors of the [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen colonies]] that rebelled against [[Great Britain|British]] rule. Most of the rest have been carved from territory obtained through war or purchase by the U.S. government. The exceptions are [[Vermont]], [[Texas]], and [[Hawaii]]; each was an independent republic before joining the union. Early in the country's history, three states were created out of the territory of existing ones: [[Kentucky]] from [[Virginia]]; [[Tennessee]] from [[North Carolina]]; and [[Maine]] from [[Massachusetts]]. [[West Virginia]] broke away from Virginia during the [[American Civil War]]. The most recent state—Hawaii—achieved statehood on [[August 21]], [[1959]]. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] [[Texas v. White|has ruled]] that the states do not have the right to [[secession|secede]] from the union.

The states compose the vast bulk of the U.S. land mass; the only other areas considered integral parts of the country are the District of Columbia, the [[Capital districts and territories|federal district]] where the capital, Washington, is located; and [[Palmyra Atoll]], an uninhabited but [[territories of the United States|incorporated territory]] in the Pacific Ocean. The United States possesses five major territories with indigenous populations: [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[United States Virgin Islands]] in the Caribbean; and [[American Samoa]], [[Guam]], and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] in the Pacific. Those born in the territories possess [[Birthright citizenship in the United States of America|U.S. citizenship]].

[[Image:MayflowerHarbor.jpg|left|thumb|The ''[[Mayflower]]'' transported [[Pilgrims]] to the New World in 1620, as depicted in William Halsall's ''The Mayflower in Plymouth Harbor'', 1882]]
On [[April 2]], [[1513]], Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Juan Ponce de León]] landed on what he called "La Florida"—the first documented European arrival on what would become the U.S. mainland. Of the colonies Spain established in the region, only [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]], founded in 1565, remains. Later Spanish settlements in the present-day [[southwestern United States]] drew thousands through Mexico. French [[fur trade]]rs established outposts of [[New France]] around the [[Great Lakes]]; France eventually claimed much of the North American interior as far south as the Gulf of Mexico. The first successful English settlements were the [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia Colony]] in [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] in 1607 and the [[Pilgrim]]s' [[Plymouth Colony]] in 1620. The 1628 chartering of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] resulted in a wave of migration; by 1634, [[New England]] had been settled by some 10,000 [[Puritan]]s. Between the late 1610s and the American Revolution, an estimated 50,000 convicts were shipped to England's, and later Great Britain's, American colonies.<ref>{{cite web|work=Butler, James Davie|url=http://www.dinsdoc.com/butler-1.htm|title=British Convicts Shipped to American Colonies | publisher = Smithsonian Institution, National Museum of Natural History|work=American Historical Review 2|date=October 1896| accessdate=2007-06-21}}</ref> Beginning in 1614, the Dutch established settlements along the lower [[Hudson River]], including [[New Amsterdam]] on [[Manhattan|Manhattan Island]]. The small settlement of [[New Sweden]], founded along the [[Delaware River]] in 1638, was taken over by the Dutch in 1655.

By 1674, English forces had won the former Dutch colonies in the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]]; the province of [[New Netherland]] was renamed [[New York]]. With the 1729 division of [[the Carolinas]] and the 1732 colonization of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], the thirteen British colonies that would become the United States of America were established. All had active local and colonial governments with elections open to most free men, with a growing devotion to the ancient [[rights of Englishmen]] and a sense of self government that stimulated support for [[republicanism]]. All had legalized the [[African slave trade]]. With high birth rates, low death rates, and steady immigration, the colonies doubled in population every twenty-five years. The Christian [[Revivalism|revivalist]] movement of the 1730s and 1740s known as the [[First Great Awakening|Great Awakening]] fueled interest in both religion and religious liberty. In the [[French and Indian War]], British forces seized Canada from the French, but the [[francophone]] population remained politically isolated from the southern colonies. By 1770, those thirteen colonies had an increasingly [[Anglicisation|Anglicized]] population of three million, approximately half that of Britain. Though [[No taxation without representation|subject to British taxation]], they were given no representation in the [[Parliament of Great Britain]].

=== Independence and expansion ===

Tensions between American colonials and the British during the [[American Revolution|revolutionary period]] of the 1760s and early 1770s led to the [[American Revolutionary War]], fought from 1775 through 1781. On [[June 14]], [[1775]], the [[Second Continental Congress|Continental Congress]], convening in [[Philadelphia]], established a [[Continental Army]] under the command of [[George Washington]]. Proclaiming that "[[all men are created equal]]" and endowed with "certain [[inalienable rights|unalienable Rights]]," the Congress adopted the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], drafted largely by [[Thomas Jefferson]], on [[July 4]], [[1776]]. In 1777, the [[Articles of Confederation]] were adopted, uniting the states under a weak federal government that operated until 1788. Some 70,000–80,000 [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalists]] to the British Crown fled the rebellious states, many to [[Nova Scotia]] and the new [[Canada under British Imperial control (1764-1867)|British holdings in Canada]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.learnquebec.ca/export/sites/learn/en/content/curriculum/social_sciences/documents/loyalistoverview.pdf|title=The United Empire Loyalists—An Overview | publisher = Learn Quebec | accessdate=2007-06-19}}</ref> Native Americans, with divided allegiances, fought on both sides of [[Western theater of the American Revolutionary War|the war's western front]].
[[Image:US states by date of statehood3.gif|thumb|left|U.S. growth by date of statehood and [[ratification]] of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]]]
After the [[Siege of Yorktown|defeat of the British army]] by American forces who were [[France in the American Revolutionary War|assisted by the French]], Great Britain [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|recognized the sovereignty]] of the thirteen states in 1783. A [[Philadelphia Convention|constitutional convention]] was organized in 1787 by those who wished to establish a strong national government with power over the states. By June 1788, nine states had ratified the [[United States Constitution]], sufficient to establish the new government; the republic's [[1st United States Congress|first Senate, House of Representatives]], and [[President of the United States|president]]—George Washington—took office in 1789. [[New York City]] was the federal capital for a year, before the government relocated to Philadelphia. In 1791, the states ratified the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], ten amendments to the Constitution forbidding federal restriction of personal freedoms and guaranteeing a range of legal protections. Attitudes toward [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] were shifting; a [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 9: Limits on Congress|clause in the Constitution]] protected the African slave trade only until 1808. The Northern states abolished slavery between 1780 and 1804, leaving the [[slave state]]s of the South as defenders of the "[[peculiar institution]]." In 1800, the federal government moved to the newly founded [[History of Washington, D.C.|Washington, D.C.]] The [[Second Great Awakening]] made [[evangelicalism]] a force behind various social [[reform movement]]s.
[[Image:U.S. Territorial Acquisitions.png|right|thumb|Territorial acquisitions by date]]
Americans' eagerness to [[Territorial acquisitions of the United States|expand westward]] began a cycle of [[Indian Wars]] that stretched to the end of the nineteenth century, as Native Americans were stripped of their land. The [[Louisiana Purchase]] of French-claimed territory under President Thomas Jefferson in 1803 virtually doubled the nation's size. The [[War of 1812]], declared against Britain over various grievances and fought to a draw, strengthened American [[nationalism]]. A series of U.S. military incursions into Florida led [[Spanish Cession|Spain to cede]] it and other Gulf Coast territory in 1819. The country annexed the [[Republic of Texas]] in 1845. The concept of [[Manifest Destiny]] was popularized during this time.<ref>Morrison, Michael A. (1999). ''Slavery and the American West: The Eclipse of Manifest Destiny and the Coming of the Civil War''. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, pp. 13–21. ISBN 0807847968.</ref> The 1846 [[Oregon Treaty]] with Britain led to U.S. control of the present-day [[Northwestern United States|American Northwest]]. The U.S. victory in the [[Mexican-American War]] resulted in the 1848 [[Mexican Cession|cession]] of [[California]] and much of the present-day [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]]. The [[California Gold Rush]] of 1848–1849 further spurred western migration. [[Rail transport in the United States#History|New railways]] made relocation much less arduous for settlers and increased conflicts with Native Americans. Over a half-century, up to 40 million [[American Bison|American bison]], commonly called buffalo, were slaughtered for skins and meat and to ease the railways' spread. The loss of the bison, a primary economic resource for the [[plains Indians]], was an existential blow to many native cultures.

=== Civil War and industrialization ===

[[Origins of the American Civil War|Tensions]] between slave and [[Free state (United States)|free states]] mounted with increasing disagreements over the relationship between the [[states' rights|state and federal governments]] and [[Bleeding Kansas|violent conflicts]] over the expansion of slavery into new states. [[Abraham Lincoln]], candidate of the largely antislavery [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], was elected president in 1860. Before he took office, seven slave states declared their [[secession]] from the United States, forming the [[Confederate States of America]]. The federal government maintained secession was illegal, and with the Confederate [[Battle of Fort Sumter|attack upon Fort Sumter]], the [[American Civil War]] began and four more slave states joined the Confederacy. The [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] [[Emancipation Proclamation|freed Confederate slaves]] as its [[Union Army|army]] advanced through the South. Following the Union victory in 1865, three amendments to the U.S. Constitution [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|ensured freedom]] for the nearly four million African Americans who had been slaves,<ref> {{cite web | url = http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1860a-02.pdf | title = 1860 Census | publisher = U.S. Census Bureau | accessdate = 2007-06-10 }} Page 7 lists a total slave population of 3,953,760.</ref> [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|made them citizens]], and [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|gave them voting rights]].

[[Image:Ellis island 1902.jpg|thumb|Immigrants landing at [[Ellis Island]], [[New York City|New York]], 1902]]
After the war, the [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|assassination of President Lincoln]] [[Radical Republican (USA)|radicalized Republican]] [[Reconstruction]] policies aimed at reintegrating and rebuilding the Southern states while ensuring the rights of the newly freed slaves. The resolution of the disputed [[United States presidential election, 1876|1876 presidential election]] by the [[Compromise of 1877]] ended Reconstruction; [[Jim Crow laws]] soon [[Disfranchisement after the Civil War|disenfranchised many African Americans]]. In the North, urbanization and an unprecedented [[Immigration to the United States#Immigration 1850 to 1930|influx of immigrants]] hastened the [[United States technological and industrial history#Technological systems and infrastructure|country's industrialization]]. The wave of immigration, which lasted until 1929, provided labor for U.S. businesses and transformed American culture. High tariff protections, national infrastructure building, and new banking regulations encouraged industrial growth. The 1867 [[Alaska purchase]] from Russia completed the country's mainland expansion. The [[Wounded Knee Massacre|Wounded Knee massacre]] in 1890 was the last major armed conflict of the [[Indian Wars]]. In 1893, the [[Ancient Hawaii|indigenous monarchy]] of the Pacific [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] was overthrown in a coup led by American residents; the archipelago was annexed by the United States in 1898. Victory in the [[Spanish-American War]] that same year demonstrated that the United States was a [[Great power|major world power]] and resulted in the annexation of Puerto Rico and the [[Philippines]].<ref>Spielvogel, Jackson J.

At the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, the United States remained neutral. Americans sympathized with the British and French, although many citizens, mostly Irish and German, opposed intervention.<ref>Foner, Eric, and John A. Garraty (1991).

Partly because of the service of many in the war, Native Americans gained [[United States nationality law|U.S. citizenship]] in the [[Indian Citizenship Act of 1924]].

During [[Roaring Twenties|most of the 1920s]], the United States enjoyed a period of unbalanced prosperity as farm profits fell while industrial profits grew. A rise in debt and an inflated [[stock market]] culminated in the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|1929 crash]] that triggered the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]]. After his election as president in 1932, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] responded with the [[New Deal]], a range of policies increasing government intervention in the economy. The [[Dust Bowl]] of the mid-1930s impoverished many farming communities and spurred a new wave of western migration. The nation would not fully recover from the economic depression until the industrial mobilization spurred by its entrance into [[World War II]]. The United States, effectively neutral during the war's early stages after the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|Nazi invasion of Poland]] in September 1939, began supplying [[materiel]] to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in March 1941 through the [[Lend-Lease]] program.

The United States and Soviet Union jockeyed for power after World War II during the Cold War, dominating the military affairs of Europe through [[NATO]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]]. The United States promoted [[liberal democracy]] and [[capitalism]], while the Soviet Union promoted [[communism]] and a centrally [[planned economy]]. The Soviet Union supported dictatorships, as did the United States, and both engaged in [[proxy war]]s. United States troops fought [[People's Republic of China|Communist Chinese]] forces in the [[Korean War]] of 1950–53. The [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] pursued a series of investigations into suspected leftist subversion, while Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] became the figurehead of anticommunist sentiment.

The Soviet Union launched the first manned spacecraft in 1961, prompting U.S. efforts to raise proficiency in mathematics and science and President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s call for the country to be first to land "a man on the moon," achieved in 1969.<ref>Rudolph, John L. (2002). ''Scientists in the Classroom: The Cold War Reconstruction of American Science Education''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, p. 1. ISBN 0312295715.</ref> Kennedy also faced a [[Cuban Missile Crisis|tense nuclear showdown]] with Soviet forces in Cuba. Meanwhile, America experienced sustained economic expansion. A growing [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|civil rights movement]] headed by prominent African Americans, such as [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], fought segregation and discrimination, leading to the abolition of [[Jim Crow laws]]. Following [[John F. Kennedy assassination|Kennedy's assassination]] in 1963, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] was passed under President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. Johnson and his successor, [[Richard Nixon]], expanded a proxy war in Southeast Asia into the unsuccessful [[Vietnam War]].

[[Image:USCapitol.jpg|thumb|right|The west front of the [[United States Capitol]], which houses the [[United States Congress]]]]

The United States is the world's oldest surviving [[federation]]. It is a [[constitutional republic]], "in which [[majority rule]] is tempered by [[minority rights]] protected by [[Law of the United States|law]]."<ref>Scheb, John M., and John M. Scheb II (2002). ''An Introduction to the American Legal System''. Florence, KY: Delmar, p. 6.

(2003). ''Overruling Democracy: The Supreme Court Vs. the American People''. London and New York: Routledge, pp. 36–38. ISBN 0415934397.</ref> The government is regulated by a system of [[separation of powers|checks and balances]] defined by the United States Constitution, which serves as the country's supreme legal document and as a [[social contract]] for the people of the United States. In the [[Federalism#United States|American federalist system]], citizens are usually subject to [[Political divisions of the United States|three levels of government]], federal, state, and local; the [[Local government in the United States|local government's]] duties are commonly split between [[County (United States)|county]] and municipal governments. In almost all cases, executive and legislative officials are elected by a [[plurality voting system|plurality vote]] of citizens by district. There is no [[proportional representation]] at the federal level, and it is very rare at lower levels. Federal and state judicial and [[cabinet]] officials are typically nominated by the executive branch and approved by the legislature, although some state judges and officials are elected by popular vote.

[[Image:HobanNorthPortico.jpg|thumb|left|The north side of the [[White House]], home and work place of the U.S. president]]

The federal government is composed of three branches:
* [[legislature|Legislative]]: The [[bicameralism|bicameral]] [[United States Congress|Congress]], made up of the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] makes [[federal law]], [[declaration of war|declares war]], approves treaties, has the [[power of the purse]], and has the rarely used power of [[impeachment]], by which it can remove sitting members of the government.
* [[Executive (government)|Executive]]: The [[President of the United States|president]] is the [[commander-in-chief]] of the military, can veto [[Bill (proposed law)|legislative bills]] before they become law, and appoints the [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]] and other officers, who administer and enforce federal laws and policies.
* [[Judiciary]]: The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] and lower [[United States federal courts|federal courts]], whose judges are appointed by the president with Senate approval, interpret laws and can overturn laws they deem [[constitutionality|unconstitutional]].

The House of Representatives has 435 members, each representing a [[congressional district]] for a two-year term. House seats are [[United States congressional apportionment|apportioned]] among the fifty states by population every tenth year. As of the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]], seven states have the minimum of one representative, while California, the most populous state, has fifty-three. Each state has two senators, elected [[at-large]] to six-year terms; one third of Senate seats are up for election every second year. The president serves a four-year term and may be elected to the office [[Term limits in the United States|no more than twice]]. The president is [[United States presidential election|not elected by direct vote]], but by an indirect [[United States Electoral College|electoral college]] system in which the determining votes are apportioned by state. The Supreme Court, led by the [[Chief Justice of the United States]], has nine members, who serve for life.

[[Image:Supreme Court Front Dusk.jpg|thumb|right|The front of the [[United States Supreme Court building]]]]

All laws and procedures of both state and federal governments are subject to review, and any law ruled in violation of the Constitution by the judicial branch is overturned. The original text of the Constitution establishes the structure and responsibilities of the federal government, the relationship between it and the individual states, and essential matters of military and economic authority. [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One]] protects the right to the "great writ" of [[Habeas corpus in the United States|habeas corpus]], and [[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article Three]] guarantees the [[Jury trial#The United States|right to a jury trial]] in all criminal cases. [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Amendments to the Constitution]] require the approval of three-fourths of the states. The Constitution has been amended twenty-seven times; the first ten amendments, which make up the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], and the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] form the central basis of individual rights in the United States.

===Parties and elections===
{{main|Elections in the United States|Political ideologies in the United States}}
Politics in the United States have operated under a [[two-party system]] for virtually all of the country's history. For elective offices at all levels, state-administered [[primary election]]s are held to choose the major party nominees for subsequent [[general election]]s. Since the [[United States presidential election, 1856|general election of 1856]], the two dominant parties have been the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], [[History of the United States Democratic Party|founded in 1824]] (though its [[Democratic-Republican Party|roots trace back to 1792]]), and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], [[History of the United States Republican Party|founded in 1854]]. Since the Civil War, only one [[Third party (United States)|third-party]] presidential candidate—former president [[Theodore Roosevelt]], running as a [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive]] in [[United States presidential election, 1912|1912]]—has won as much as 20% of the popular vote.

The incumbent president, Republican [[George W. Bush]], is the [[List of Presidents of the United States|43rd president in the country's history]]. All U.S. presidents to date have been white men. If the Democrats win the next presidential election, in November 2008, either an African-American, [[Barack Obama]], or a woman, [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]], will become president. Following the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 midterm elections]], the Democratic Party controls both the House and the Senate. Every member of the U.S. Congress is a Democrat or a Republican except two [[Independent (politician)|independent]] members of the Senate—one a former Democratic incumbent, the other a self-described [[socialism|socialist]]. An [[Political party strength in U.S. states|overwhelming majority]] of state and local officials are also either Democrats or Republicans.

Within American [[political culture]], the Republican Party is considered "center-right" or [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] and the Democratic Party is considered "center-left" or [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]], but members of both parties have a wide range of views. In a January 2008 poll, 39% of Americans described themselves as "conservative," 33% as "moderate," and 20% as "liberal."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://209.85.207.104/search?q=cache:qZUdDblYBnkJ:www.ipsos-na.com/news/client/act_dsp_pdf.cfm%3Fname%3Dmr080118-1topline.pdf%26id%3D3790+%22associated+press%22+ipsos+poll+liberal+conservative&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=us&client=safari|title=The Associated Press Poll Conducted by Ipsos Public Affairs/Project #81-5681-73 |publisher=Ipsos Public Affairs|date=[[2008-01-17]]|accessdate=2008-02-06}}</ref> On the other hand, a plurality of adults, 35.9%, identify as Democrats, 32.9% as independents, and 31.3% as Republicans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/mood_of_america/party_affiliation/number_of_democrats_falls_to_new_low_republicans_decline_too|title=Number of Democrats Falls to New Low, Republicans Decline Too|publisher=Rasmussen Reports|date=[[2007-08-01]]|accessdate=2007-08-20}}</ref> The states of the [[Northeastern United States#Politics|Northeast]] and [[Western United States#Politics|West Coast]] and some of the [[Great Lakes]] states are relatively liberal-leaning—they are known in political parlance as "[[Red states and blue states|blue states]]."

American [[isolationism|isolationists]] have often been at odds with internationalists, as anti-imperialists have been with promoters of [[Manifest Destiny]] and [[American Empire]]. American [[Philippine-American War|imperialism in the Philippines]] drew sharp rebukes from [[Mark Twain]], philosopher [[William James]], and many others. Later, President [[Woodrow Wilson]] played a key role in creating the [[League of Nations]], but the Senate prohibited American membership in it. Isolationism became a thing of the past when the United States took a lead role in founding the United Nations, becoming a permanent member of the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] and host to the [[United Nations Headquarters]]. The United States enjoys a [[special relationship]] with the [[Anglo-American relations|United Kingdom]] and strong ties with [[United States-Australia relations|Australia]], [[New Zealand-United States relations|New Zealand]], [[Japan-United States relations|Japan]], [[Israel-United States relations|Israel]], and fellow NATO members. It also works closely with its neighbors through the [[Organization of American States]] and [[free trade area|free trade agreements]] such as the trilateral [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] with [[Canada – United States relations|Canada]] and [[United States-Mexico relations|Mexico]]. In 2005, the United States spent $27.3 billion on [[official development assistance]], the most in the world; however, as a share of [[Gross National Income|gross national income]] (GNI), the U.S. contribution of 0.22% ranked twentieth of twenty-two donor states. On the other hand, nongovernmental sources such as private foundations, corporations, and educational and religious institutions donated $95.5 billion. The total of $122.8 billion is again the most in the world and seventh in terms of GNI percentage.<ref>{{citeweb|title=Americans Favor Private Giving, People-to-People Contacts|date=[[2007-05-24]]|publisher=U.S. Dept. of State, International Information Programs|url=http://usinfo.state.gov/xarchives/display.html?p=washfile-english&y=2007&m=May&x=20070524165115zjsredna0.2997553|accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref>

The Department of Defense also employs approximately 700,000 civilians, disregarding contractors. Military service is voluntary, though [[Conscription in the United States|conscription]] may occur in wartime through the [[Selective Service System]]. The rapid deployment of American forces is facilitated by the Air Force's large fleet of transportation aircraft and aerial refueling tankers, the Navy's fleet of eleven active aircraft carriers, and [[Marine Expeditionary Unit]]s at sea in the Navy's [[United States Fleet Forces Command|Atlantic and]] [[Commander United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific fleets]].

The United States has been a leader in scientific research and technological innovation since the late nineteenth century. In 1876, [[Alexander Graham Bell]] was awarded the first U.S. [[Invention of the telephone|patent for the telephone]]. The [[Edison, New Jersey|laboratory]] of [[Thomas Edison]] developed the [[Phonograph#The first phonograph|phonograph]], the first [[Incandescent light bulb#History of the light bulb|long-lasting light bulb]], and the first viable [[Kinetoscope|movie camera]]. In the early twentieth century, the automobile companies of [[Ransom E. Olds]] and [[Henry Ford]] pioneered [[assembly line]] manufacturing.

The [[rhythm]]ic and [[lyrics|lyrical]] styles of [[African American music]] have deeply influenced [[Music of the United States|American music]] at large, distinguishing it from European traditions. Elements from [[Folk music|folk]] idioms such as the [[blues]] and what is now known as [[old-time music]] were adopted and transformed into [[popular music|popular genres]] with global audiences. [[Jazz]] was developed by innovators such as [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[Duke Ellington]] early in the twentieth century. [[Country music]], [[rhythm and blues]], and [[rock and roll]] emerged between the 1920s and 1950s. In the 1960s, [[Bob Dylan]] emerged from the [[American folk music revival|folk revival]] to become one of America's greatest songwriters and [[James Brown]] led the development of [[funk]]. More recent American creations include [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[house music]]. American pop stars such as [[Elvis Presley]], [[Michael Jackson]], and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] have become global celebrities.

=== Literature, philosophy, and the arts ===

[[Image:Mountrushmore.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mount Rushmore]], a massive sculpture of four prominent American presidents]]
In the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, American art and literature took most of its cues from Europe. Writers such as [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], and [[Henry David Thoreau]] established a distinctive American literary voice by the middle of the nineteenth century. [[Mark Twain]] and poet [[Walt Whitman]] were major figures in the century's second half; [[Emily Dickinson]], virtually unknown during her lifetime, is recognized as America's other essential poet. Eleven U.S. citizens have won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], most recently [[Toni Morrison]] in 1993. [[Ernest Hemingway]], the 1954 Nobel laureate, is often named as one of the most influential writers of the twentieth century.<ref>Meyers, Jeffrey (1999). ''Hemingway: A Biography''. New York: Da Capo, p. 139. ISBN 0306808900.</ref> A work seen as capturing fundamental aspects of the national experience and character—such as [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' (1851), Twain's ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn|The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'' (1885), and [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]'s ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' (1925)—may be dubbed the "[[Great American Novel]]." Popular literary genres such as the [[Western literature|Western]] and [[hardboiled|hardboiled crime fiction]] developed in the United States.

The [[transcendentalism|transcendentalists]], led by [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and Thoreau, established the first major American [[philosophical movement]]. After the Civil War, [[Charles Peirce]] and then [[William James]] and [[John Dewey]] were leaders in the development of [[pragmatism]]. In the twentieth century, the work of [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W.V.O. Quine]] and [[Richard Rorty]] helped bring [[analytic philosophy]] to the fore in U.S. academic circles.

In the visual arts, the [[Hudson River School]] was an important mid-nineteenth-century movement in the tradition of European [[Naturalism (arts)|naturalism]]. The 1913 [[Armory Show]] in New York City, an exhibition of European [[Modern art|modernist art]], shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene.<ref>Brown, Milton W. (1988 1963). ''The Story of the Armory Show''. New York: Abbeville. ISBN 0896597954.</ref> [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], [[Marsden Hartley]], and others experimented with new styles, displaying a highly individualistic sensibility. Major artistic movements such as the [[abstract expressionism]] of [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]] and the [[pop art]] of [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] have developed largely in the United States. The tide of modernism and then [[postmodernism]] has also brought American architects such as [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[Philip Johnson]], and [[Frank Gehry]] to the top of their field.

One of the first notable promoters of the nascent American theater was impresario [[P. T. Barnum]], who began operating a lower [[Manhattan]] entertainment complex in 1841. The team of [[Edward Harrigan|Harrigan and Hart]] produced a series of popular [[musical theatre|musical]] comedies in New York starting in the late 1870s. In the twentieth century, the modern musical form emerged on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]; the songs of musical theater composers such as [[Irving Berlin]], [[Cole Porter]], and [[Stephen Sondheim]] have become [[Traditional pop music|pop standards]]. Playwright [[Eugene O'Neill]] won the Nobel literature prize in 1936; other acclaimed U.S. dramatists include multiple [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama|Pulitzer Prize]] winners [[Tennessee Williams]], [[Edward Albee]], and [[August Wilson]].

Though largely overlooked at the time, [[Charles Ives]]' work of the 1910s established him as the first major U.S. composer in the classical tradition; other experimentalists such as [[Henry Cowell]] and [[John Cage]] created an identifiably American approach to classical composition. [[Aaron Copland]] and [[George Gershwin]] developed a unique American synthesis of popular and classical music. [[Choreography|Choreographers]] [[Isadora Duncan]] and [[Martha Graham]] were central figures in the creation of [[modern dance]]; [[George Balanchine]] and [[Jerome Robbins]] were leaders in twentieth-century ballet. The United States has long been at the fore in the relatively modern artistic medium of [[photography]], with major practitioners such as [[Alfred Stieglitz]], [[Edward Steichen]], [[Ansel Adams]], and many others. The newspaper [[comic strip]] and the [[American comic book|comic book]] are both U.S. innovations. [[Superman]], the quintessential comic book [[superhero]], has become an American icon.

[[Image:Motherhood and apple pie.jpg|thumb|American cultural icons: [[apple pie]], [[baseball]], and the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]]]]
Mainstream American culinary arts are similar to those in other Western countries. [[Wheat]] is the primary [[cereal]] grain. Traditional American cuisine uses ingredients such as [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]], [[white-tailed deer]] [[venison]], [[potato]]es, [[sweet potato]]es, [[maize|corn]], [[squash (plant)|squash]], and [[maple syrup]], indigenous foods employed by Native Americans and early European settlers. Slow-cooked pork and beef [[barbecue]], [[crab cake]]s, [[potato chip]]s, and [[chocolate chip cookie]]s are distinctively American styles. [[Soul food]], developed by African slaves, is popular around the South and among many African Americans elsewhere. [[Syncretism|Syncretic]] cuisines such as [[Louisiana Creole cuisine|Louisiana creole]], [[Cajun cuisine|Cajun]], and [[Tex-Mex cuisine|Tex-Mex]] are regionally important. Characteristic dishes such as [[apple pie]], [[fried chicken]], [[pizza]], [[hamburger]]s, and [[hot dog]]s derive from the recipes of various immigrants. [[French fried potatoes|French fries]], Mexican dishes such as [[burrito]]s and [[taco]]s, and [[pasta]] dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are widely consumed.<ref name="IFT">{{cite web |url=http://www.ift.org/cms/?pid=1000496 |author=Klapthor, James N. |title=What, When, and Where Americans Eat in 2003 |publisher=Institute of Food Technologists |date=[[2003-08-23]] |accessdate=2007-06-19}}</ref> Americans generally prefer coffee to tea.

Since the late nineteenth century, [[baseball]] has been regarded as the [[national sport]]; [[American football|football]], [[basketball]], and [[ice hockey]] are the country's three other leading professional team sports.

While most major U.S. sports have evolved out of European practices, basketball, [[volleyball]], [[skateboarding]], and [[snowboarding]] are American inventions.
