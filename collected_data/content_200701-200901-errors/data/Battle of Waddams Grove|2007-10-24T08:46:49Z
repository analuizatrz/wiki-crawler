The '''Battle of Waddams Grove''', also known as the '''Battle of Yellow Creek''', took place in present-day [[Stephenson County, Illinois]] on [[June 18]], [[1832]] [[Black Hawk War]]. After several incidents of [[Sauk]] Indian raids on settlers along the [[Apple River (Illinois)|Apple River]], Captain [[James W. Stephenson]] left [[Galena, Illinois|Galena]] with a group of volunteer militia in pursuit of the Native party. The group clashed on [[June 18]], [[1832]] near the Yellow Creek and the ensuing battle descended into a [[bayonet]] and knife fight in which several Sauk and three [[militia]] men were killed. Stephenson was severely wounded by a musketball to the chest during the fighting. The dead were eventually interred in a memorial cemetery in [[Kellogg's Grove, Illinois]] where a stone monument was erected in memory of those killed during the war.

==Background==
Angered by the loss of his birthplace, in prior disputed treaties, [[Black Hawk]] led a number of incursions across the [[Mississippi River]] beginning in 1830. Each time, he was persuaded to return west without bloodshed. In April 1832, encouraged by promises of alliances with other tribes and the [[United Kingdom|British]], he again moved his "[[British Band]]," of around 1,000 warriors and civilians, into [[Illinois]].<ref name=lewis>Lewis, James.

The conflict became known as the [[Black Hawk War]].

Following the first confrontation of the war [[Stillman Creek (Illinois)|Stillman's Run]], the exaggerated claim that 2,000 "bloodthirsty warriors were sweeping all northern Illinois with the bosom of destruction" sent shock waves of terror through the region.<ref name=stmuseum>"[http://www.il.ngb.army.mil/Museum/HistoricalEvents/Blackhawk.htm Black Hawk War]," Historical Events, ''Illinois State Military Museum''.

==Prelude==
On [[June 9]], [[1832]], between two attacks that occurred at [[Fort Blue Mounds]], a party of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] crossed over from the west side of the [[Mississippi River]] near [[Galena, Illinois|Galena]]. The group continued up the [[Apple River (Illinois)|Apple River]], looting and stealing horses along the way, including an incident about Â¾ of the way up the Apple River in which about a dozen horses were stolen from a small [[stockade]].<ref name=trask/> The Sauk raiding parties were mostly stealing food and supplies for Black Hawk's band of 1,000 men, women and children which were camped in the marshes of southwestern [[Wisconsin]].<ref name=wisc>"[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/diary/002869.asp James Stephenson Describes the Battle at Yellow Creek], Historic Diaries: The Black Hawk War, ''Wisconsin Historical Society''. Retrieved [[31 July]] [[2007]].</ref> A similar incident a few days later, though without injury or death, prompted a reaction from the white militia in the area. 
 
Rising anxiety levels in the white settlers caused Captain James W. Stephenson to gather 12 volunteers and move toward the area of the disturbances from Galena. Stephenson recruited more men at [[Apple River Fort]] and then traveled eastward.<ref name=trask>Trask, Kerry A.

Stephenson caught up with the band of Native Americans on [[June 18]], [[1832]] in an open area near [[Yellow Creek (Illinois)|Yellow Creek]], about 12 miles east of Kellogg's Grove, Illinois.<ref name=nrhp/><ref name=trask/><ref name=carter>Carter, Greg. "[http://www.geocities.com/old_lead/waddam.htm Captain Stephenson's Fight]," May 2004, ''Old Lead Historical Society''. Retrieved [[31 July]] [[2007]].</ref> Initially, the militia could not get a clear shot at the Sauk as they rushed for cover in a wooded area near the creek. The militia men observed from what was likely to be West Point Hill.<ref name=trask/><ref name=carter/>

Shots rang out from Stephenson's men but the Sauk did not immediately return fire and the fight eventually descended into a bayonet and knife battle.<ref name=trask/><ref name=carter/> The militia charged into the thicket and the Sauk returned fire, killing Stephen P. Howard. The militia force made two more charges into the woods. During one of these, Thomas Sublette stabbed a Sauk in the neck and George Eames was [[killed in action]]. The third charge resulted in severe wounds for Stephenson, who was shot in the chest with a [[musket]]ball, and the death of militia man Michael Lovell.<ref name=carter/><ref name=trask/> According to Stephenson's account of the battle, five or six Native American warriors were killed and the militia lost three men. 

The Sauk forces outnumbered Stephenson's militiamen and the group was forced to withdraw and [[Withdrawal (military)|retreat]]. When they left they took with them most of the horses that the Sauk had stolen in their journey up the Apple River.<ref name=trask/>

==Aftermath==
Although it allowed the militia men to draw Native American blood in revenge, the result of the battle was inconclusive with respect to its original purpose of stopping the Native American raids in the area.<ref name=trask/> The men of the militia returned triumphantly to Galena, Illinois bearing the [[scalping|scalps]] of two Sauk warriors they had slain.<ref name=trask/> The battle helped raise public opinion towards the militia.<ref name=wisc/> After the disastrous defeat at [[Battle of Stillman's Run|Stillman's Run]] in May, the battle at Yellow Creek coupled with the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1832)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]], helped to demonstrate that the militia could stand up to and defeat Black Hawk's warriors.<ref name=wisc/>

The militiamen killed in the Battle of Waddams Grove were eventually interred in a memorial cemetery in Kellogg's Grove. The graves are located beneath a large stone monument dedicated to those militia men killed during the Black Hawk War.<ref name=nrhp>Dameier, Evelyn.
