'''''Night of the Ghouls''''' is a [[1959]] [[Ed Wood, Jr.|Ed Wood]] [[horror film|horror]] [[film]], a sequel of sorts to ''[[Bride of the Monster]]''. The film was not publicly exhibited until [[1987]], as Wood could not afford to pay the lab fees to process the negatives, so they were held at a post-production house for 23 years.

In [[1983]], millionaire Wade Williams was informed about the film by Kathy Wood, and paid the outstanding lab fees, in addition to giving it a new title, as Wood had called it ''Revenge of the Dead''. The film received limited theatrical play, and was simultaneously released on home video.

==Trivia==
{{Trivia|date=June 2007}}
*This was 1 of 5 films featured on the cinema marquee in the movie "[[The Midnight Hour]]"
*Towards the beginning of the film, in the police station, a picture of Wood is visible on the wall.
*This film is part of what Wood aficionados refer to as "The Kelton Trilogy", a trio of films featuring [[Paul Marco]] as "Officer Kelton", a whining, reluctant policeman. The other two films are ''[[Bride of the Monster]]'' and ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]''. 
* [[Tom Mason]] appeared in this film, credited as "Thomas R. Mason". Mason was the man Wood used to replace [[Bela Lugosi]] in ''[[Plan 9 From Outer Space]]''; this was his only other feature film appearance.
* [[Kenne Duncan]] had previously worked for Wood in a [[television|TV]] on trick shooting and in Wood's 1953 TV pilot ''Crossroad Avenger''.
* The character of Dr. Acula also appeared in an unrealized Ed Wood film project of the same name. The role was originally intended for [[Bela Lugosi]].  "Dr. Acula" is a frequently used alias of [[Forrest J. Ackerman]].
* Although portrayed as a follow up to the events of ''[[Bride of the Monster]]'', ''Night of the Ghouls'' featured only two characters from that film (Kelton and Lobo), and, in a [[retcon]], it is claimed that Lt. Bradford had worked on the earlier case when he in fact appeared nowhere in ''Bride''. Harvey B. Dunn, who played Captain Tom Robbins in ''Bride'', plays a different character in this film. Lt. Dan Bradford claims to have been involved in the events of ''Bride'', but is nowhere to be found in that film.
*In the sitcom ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'' the main character J.D. is making a movie called "Dr. Acula".
* The [[Misfits]] song called "Ghouls Night Out" is named after this movie.
