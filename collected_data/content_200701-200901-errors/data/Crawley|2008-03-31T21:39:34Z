'''Crawley''' ({{Audio|en-uk-Crawley.ogg|pronunciation}}) is a town and [[local government district]] with [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|Borough status]] in [[West Sussex]], [[England]]. It is {{convert|28|mi|km|0|lk=on}} south of [[London]], {{convert|18|mi|km|0}} north of [[Brighton and Hove]], and {{convert|32|mi|km|0}} northeast of the county town of [[Chichester]], covers an area of {{convert|17.36|sqmi|sqkm|2|lk=on}} and had a population of 99,744 at the time of the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 Census]].

The area has been inhabited since [[Three-age system|the Stone Age]], and was a centre of iron-making in [[Roman Britain|Roman]] times. Later, Crawley developed slowly as a [[market town]] until the [[Second World War]], after which the area was designated as the site of one of the "new towns" proposed by the [[New Towns Act 1946]]. Rapid development followed, encouraged by the growth of nearby [[Gatwick Airport]].

The town comprises 13 planned "neighbourhoods" (residential areas), separated by main roads and railway lines, and based around the core of the old market town.  The nearby communities of [[Ifield, Crawley|Ifield]], [[Pound Hill, Crawley|Pound Hill]] and [[Three Bridges]] were absorbed into the new town at different stages of its development. As at 2008, expansion is planned in the west and northwest of the town, in co-operation with [[Horsham (district)|Horsham District Council]].<ref name="wnw">{{Cite web|url=http://194.201.99.228/Index.htm|title=West and North West of Crawley|accessdate=2007-07-31|publisher=Horsham District Council|year=2007|author=Horsham District Council & Crawley Borough Council|work=West and North West of Crawley website}}</ref>

==History==
===Origins===
The earliest known evidence of human activity in what is now Crawley is evidenced by [[prehistory|prehistoric]] finds that imply habitation at around 5000&nbsp;BC.<ref name="cbchist">{{Cite web|url=http://www.crawley.gov.uk/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&nodeId=221&strCSS=PB1_SS_MAIN|title=A Brief History of Crawley|accessdate=2007-07-31|publisher=Crawley Borough Council|year=2007|work=Crawley Borough Council website}}</ref> Evidence of a human presence in the region includes [[Neolithic]] tools, [[Roman Britain|Roman]] ironworks and a [[Bronze Age]] sword.<ref name="cole">{{cite book | title=Crawley: A History & Celebration| last=Cole| first=Belinda| date=2004| publisher=Frith Book Company Ltd| location=Salisbury| id=1904938191}}</ref>

There is evidence that the area was settled during the [[Mesolithic]] period: examples of locally manufactured [[flint]]s of the Horsham Culture type have been found to the southwest of the town. Evidence exists of [[Bronze Age]] [[burial mound]]s just to the south of the town, suggesting habitation during that period. Other finds imply continued habitation through Roman times.<ref name="cole"/> 

In the 5th century, [[Saxons|Saxon]] settlers gave the area its name of Crow's Leah—meaning a crow-infested clearing, or Crow's Wood<ref name="cole"/>—although the name changed considerably over time.  The present spelling appeared by the early 14th century.<ref name="cbchist"/> By this time, nearby settlements were more established: the Saxon church at [[Worth, West Sussex|Worth]], for example, dates from between 950 and 1050 AD.<ref name="WorthChurch">{{cite web|url=http://www.crawley.gov.uk/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&ssDocName=INT009968|title=Crawley Borough Council: St Nicholas Church|accessdate=2007-03-28|publisher=Crawley Borough Council|year=2008|work=Crawley Borough Council website}}</ref>

Although Crawley itself is not mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, the nearby settlements of [[Ifield, Crawley|Ifield]] and [[Worth, West Sussex|Worth]] are recorded.<ref name="Domesday">{{cite web|url=http://www.crawley.gov.uk/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&ssDocName=INT009967|title=Crawley Borough Council: St Margaret's Church|accessdate=2007-03-28|publisher=Crawley Borough Council|year=2008|work=Crawley Borough Council website}}</ref>  The first written record of Crawley is found in the granting of a right to hold a market in the town in 1202. Issued by [[King John]], it allowed for a weekly market on Wednesdays.<ref name="miscellany">{{cite book | title=Crawley: An Illustrated Miscellany| last=Cole| first=Belinda ''(text adapted from original material)''| date=2004| publisher=Frith Book Company Ltd| location=Salisbury| id=1904938744}}</ref> As time passed, the importance of Crawley grew slowly, boosted in the 18th century by the popularity of [[Brighton]]; Crawley prospered as a coaching halt offering an almost hourly service to Brighton and [[London]].<ref name="cole"/><ref name="pigot">{{cite book | title=Pigot's Directory of Sussex| url=http://www.historicaldirectories.org/hd/pageviewer.asp?pnum=31&zoom=&dn=WSC13002tif&fn=| date=1839| pages=681| publisher=Pigot| location=London & Manchester| id=WSC13002 }}</ref>  The George, a [[Timber framing|timber-framed]] house dating from the 15th century, expanded over the years to take over adjacent buildings and become a large coaching inn.  The increase in Brighton's popularity, and Crawley's location halfway between it and London, meant that an annexe had to be built in the middle of the wide High Street; this survived until the 1930s.<ref name="George">{{Cite web|url=http://www.crawley.gov.uk/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&strCSS=PB1_SS_MAIN&ssDocName=INT009956|title=Crawley High Street|accessdate=2007-08-03|publisher=Crawley Borough Council|year=2007|work=Crawley Borough Council website}}</ref>  The original building has become the George Hotel, with conference facilities and 84 bedrooms; it retains many period features including an iron [[Fireplace#Accessories|fireback]].<ref name="townwalk">{{Cite web|url=http://www.crawley.gov.uk/stellent/groups/public/documents/otherdocs/int037605.pdf|title=Crawley Town Walk|accessdate=2007-08-03|publisher=Crawley Borough Council|year=2007|work=Crawley Borough Council website}}</ref><ref name="Hotel">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gatwickgeorgehotel.com/overview.htm|title=The George Hotel|accessdate=2007-08-03||year=2007|work=The George Hotel website}}</ref>

Crawley's oldest church is St John the Baptist's, between the High Street and the Broadway.  It has 13th century origins,<ref name="StJB">{{Cite web|url=http://www.acny.org.uk/venue.php?V=4860|title=Diocese of Chichester: St John the Baptist, Crawley|accessdate=2007-09-13|publisher=Oxford Diocesan Publications Ltd|year=2007|work=A Church Near You website}}</ref> but there has been much rebuilding (especially in the 19th century) and the oldest part remaining is the south wall of the [[nave]], which is believed to be 14th century.  The church has a [[Bell tower|tower]] (originally 15th century, but rebuilt in 1804) which originally contained four bells cast in 1724.  Two were replaced by Thomas Lester of London in 1742; but in 1880 a new set of eight bells were cast and installed by the Croydon-based firm Gillett, Bland & Company.<ref name="MoreStJB">{{Cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=56939#s3|title=Parishes: Crawley|accessdate=2007-09-13|publisher=British History Online|year=1940|author=Hudson, T.P.

===Railway age and Victorian era===
The railways first came to Crawley by way of the [[Brighton Main Line]] passing through a station at [[Three Bridges]] (originally known as East Crawley)<ref name="eastcrawley">{{Cite web|url=http://www.maidenbower.org.uk/history/palmerhistory.pdf|title=A brief history of Maidenbower|accessdate=2007-09-06|author=David Palmer|publisher=Stuart Cummings|year=2003|work=Maidenbower Village website}}</ref> in the summer of 1841. The opening of the [[Arun Valley Line|Horsham branch]] in 1848 allowed a new [[Crawley railway station]] to be built more centrally, at the southern end of the High Street. A line to [[East Grinstead railway station|East Grinstead]] was opened in 1855. By this stage, Three Bridges was becoming the hub of transport in the area, with one-quarter of its population being employed in railway jobs by 1861 (mainly at the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]]'s railway works near the station);<ref name="fredgray">

The locally famous Longley company—one of South East England's largest building firms in the late 19th century, responsible for buildings including [[Christ's Hospital]] school and the King Edward VII [[Sanatorium]] in [[Midhurst]]—set up business alongside the line in 1881.<ref name="longley">{{Cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=18407|title=Ifield: Economic History|accessdate=2008-03-03|publisher=British History Online|year=1987|author=Hudson, T.P. (Ed)|work=A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 6 Part 3}}</ref> At that time the town experienced a major expansion in housebuilding, including the creation of an area known as "New Town" (unrelated to the postwar developments) around the railway [[level crossing]] and down the Brighton Road.<ref name="cole"/><ref name="fredgray"/>

During the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] period Crawley continued to grow, with considerable building in the [[West Green, Crawley|West Green]] area and development south of the railway in what is now [[Southgate, Crawley|Southgate]]. In 1891, a racecourse was opened at Gatwick, with the [[Grand National]] being held there during the years of the [[World War I|First World War]].<ref name="cbchist"/>  The population reached 4,433 in 1901, compared to 1,357 a century earlier.<ref name="popC"/>

As the 20th century arrived, considerable development continued around the town centre. An airfield was opened in 1930 on land near the racecourse. This was a private concern until the [[World War II|Second World War]] when it was claimed by the [[Royal Air Force]].<ref name="cbchist"/>  Around this time, many of the large 19th-century [[Estate (house)|country estates]] in the area, with their [[mansion]]s and associated grounds and outbuildings, were split up into smaller plots of land, attracting haphazard housing development and small farms.<ref name="fredgray"/>

By the outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914 Crawley had grown into a small but prosperous town, serving a wide rural area as well as its own population and those passing through on the [[A23 road|A23]] London&ndash;Brighton road; three-quarters of the population had piped water supplies, all businesses and homes had electricity, and piped gas and street lighting had been in place for 50 years.<ref name="fredgray"/>

===New Town===
[[Image:Crawley - The Boulevard (W).jpg|thumb|right|The Boulevard, a main east–west road separating the civic and retail areas of Crawley]]

The area around Crawley was identified as a suitable location for a [[New towns in the United Kingdom|New Town]] in May 1946, but was not officially designated as such until {{nowrap|[[9 January]] [[1947]]}}.<ref name="Gazette">{{LondonGazette|issue=37849|startpage=231|date=10 January 1947|accessdate=2007-10-30}}</ref> The {{convert|5920|acre|ha|0}} of land set aside for the new town were split across the county borders between [[East Sussex]], [[West Sussex]] and [[Surrey]]. Architect [[Thomas Bennett (architect)|Thomas Bennett]] was appointed as chairman of the Development Corporation for the town. A court challenge to the designation order meant that plans were not officially confirmed until December 1947. By this time, an initial plan for the development of the area had been drawn up by planner Anthony Minoprio.<ref name="vic">{{Cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=18414|title=Crawley New Town|accessdate=2007-07-31|publisher=British History Online|year=1987|author=Hudson, T.P.

Work began almost immediately, preparing the groundwork for the expansion of the town, with a full master plan in place by 1949. The plan envisaged an increase in the population of the town from 40,000 to 50,000, with residential properties in nine neighbourhoods radiating from the town centre, and a separate industrial area to the north.<ref name="vic"/> The neighbourhoods would consist mainly of three-bedroom family homes, with a number of smaller and larger properties. Each would be built around a centre with shops, a [[Church (building)|church]], a [[public house]], a [[primary school]] and a [[community centre]].<ref name="cbc"/> [[Secondary education]] was to be provided at three campuses across the town at [[Ifield, Crawley|Ifield Green]], [[Three Bridges]] and [[Tilgate, Crawley|Tilgate]].<ref name="plan">{{cite journal | title=First proposed structure plan, 1947| journal=Nostalgia: A Crawley Observer Supplement| year=1995| issue=2| page=3}}</ref> Later, a fourth campus was added to the plans in [[Southgate, Crawley|Southgate]].<ref name="masterplan">{{Cite map|title=The Crawley Development Corporation's Master Plan for Crawley New Town|publisher=Crawley Development Corporation|year=1949}}</ref>

At first, little development took place in the town centre, the existing high street still being used for shopping. The earliest progress was in [[West Green, Crawley|West Green]], which residents moved into during the late 1940s. In 1950 the town was visited by the then heir to the throne, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Princess Elizabeth]], when she officially opened the [[Manor Royal, Crawley|Manor Royal]] industrial area. Building work continued throughout the 1950s in [[West Green, Crawley|West Green]], [[Northgate, Crawley|Northgate]] and [[Three Bridges]], and later in [[Langley Green, Crawley|Langley Green]], [[Pound Hill, Crawley|Pound Hill]] and [[Ifield, Crawley|Ifield]]. In 1956, land at "Tilgate East" was allocated for housing use, eventually becoming the new neighbourhood of [[Furnace Green, Crawley|Furnace Green]].<ref name="vic"/>

[[Image:Woodfield Road, Northgate.JPG|thumb|right|A typical residential road: Woodfield Road in the Northgate neighbourhood]]

Expectations of the eventual population of the town were revised upwards several times.  The 1949 master plan had allowed for 50,000 people, but this was amended to 55,000 in 1956 after the Development Corporation had successfully resisted pressure from the Minister for Town and Country Planning to accommodate 60,000.  Nevertheless, plans dated 1961 anticipated growth to 70,000 by 1980, and by 1969 consideration was given to an eventual expansion of up to 120,000.<ref name="vic"/>

Developments in the town centre saw the planning of extended shopping facilities to the east of the existing high street. The first stage to open was The Broadwalk in 1954, following by the official opening of the Queen's Square development by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty The Queen]] in 1958. Crawley railway station was moved eastwards towards the new development.<ref name="vic"/>

By April 1960, when Thomas Bennett made his last presentation as chairman of the Development Corporation, the town's population had reached 51,700; {{convert|2289000|sqft|sqm|-2}} of factory and other industrial space had been provided; 21,800 people were employed, with nearly 60% of jobs being in manufacturing industry; and only seventy people were registered as unemployed.  The corporation had built 10,254 houses, and private builders provided around 1,500 more. Tenants were by then permitted to buy their houses, and 440&nbsp;householders had chosen to do so by April 1960.<ref name="13years"/>

[[Image:St Mary's Church, Southgate, Crawley.jpg|thumb|right|Each neighbourhood includes a church (St Mary's in Southgate shown here), a school, shops and other facilities.]]

A new plan was put forward by West Sussex County Council in 1961. This proposed new neighbourhoods at Broadfield and Bewbush, both of which extended outside the administrative area of the then Urban District Council. Plans were drawn up for Broadfield in the late 1960s, with development in place by the early 1970s. Further expansion at Bewbush was begun in 1974, although development there was slow. The two neighbourhoods were both larger than previous ones, with a combined proposed population of 23,000. Work took place in the area now known as Ifield West on the western fringes of the town.<ref name="vicdates"/>

By 1980, the council identified land at Maidenbower as being suitable for further expansion of the town to accommodate the growing population, and work began in 1986. However, all of this development was undertaken privately, unlike the earlier neighbourhoods which had included largely council-owned accommodation.<ref name="vicdates"/>

In 1999, plans were announced to develop a fourteenth neighbourhood on land at Tinsley Green to the northeast of the existing town. However, these were halted due to proposals for possible expansion at [[London Gatwick Airport|Gatwick Airport]].<ref name="nesector">{{Cite web|url=http://www.crawley.gov.uk/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&ssDocName=PR1966&ssTargetNodeId=99|title=Council wins fight against new neighbourhood|accessdate=2007-08-21|publisher=Crawley Borough Council|date=[[2007-05-15]]|author=Janet Treagus|work=Crawley Borough Council website}}</ref> As of 2008, discussions are underway with [[Horsham]] District Council concerning possible future provision of new housing on Crawley's western fringes; much of the land proposed for development currently lies within Horsham's administrative boundaries.<ref name="wnw"/>

==Governance==
[[Image:Crawley Town Hall 01.JPG|thumb|right|Crawley Town Hall, on The Boulevard in the town centre]]
Crawley Urban District Council was formed in April 1956 from the part of the Horsham Rural District which fell within the new town's area. The [[Local Government Act 1972]] led to the district being reformed as a borough in April 1974, gaining a mayor for the first time.

The Urban District Council received its [[coat of arms]] from the [[College of Heralds]] in 1957. After the change to borough status a modified coat of arms, based on the original, was awarded in 1976, and presented to the council on [[24 March]] [[1977]]. It features a central cross on a shield, representing the town's location at the meeting point of north–south and east–west roads. The shield bears nine [[martlet]]s representing both the county of [[Sussex]] and the new town's original nine neighbourhoods. Supporters, of an eagle and a winged lion, relate to the significance of the airport to the locality. The motto featured is ''I Grow and I Rejoice''—a translation of a phrase from the ''Epistulae'' of [[Seneca the Younger]].<ref name="arms">{{Cite web|url=http://www.crawley.gov.uk/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&ssDocName=INT010340&ssTargetNodeId=425&strCSS=PB1_SS_MAIN|title=Coat of Arms|accessdate=2007-09-01|publisher=Crawley Borough Council|year=2007|work=Crawley Borough Council website}}</ref>

Initially the district (and then borough) council worked with the [[English Partnerships|Commission for New Towns]] on many aspects of development; but in 1978 many of the commission's assets, such as housing and parks, were surrendered to the council. The authority's boundaries were extended in 1983 to allow for increasing development in Bewbush and Broadfield.<ref name="guide">{{cite book | title=Crawley: Official Guide| last=Crawley Borough Council| date=1997| publisher=Local Authority Publishing Co. Ltd.| location=Wallington}}</ref>

The borough remains part of the local two-tier arrangements, with services shared with West Sussex County Council. The authority is divided into 15 wards, each of which is represented by two or three local councillors, forming a total council of 37 members. Most wards are coterminous with the borough's neighbourhoods, but two neighbourhoods are divided: Broadfield into North and South wards, and Pound Hill into "Pound Hill North" and "Pound Hill South and Worth". The council is elected in thirds.<ref name="bcfe">{{Cite web|url=http://www.boundarycommittee.org.uk/files/dms/Crawley_5885-5489__E__.pdf|title=Final recommendations on the future electoral arrangements for Crawley in West Sussex|accessdate=2007-07-31|publisher=The Boundary Committee for England|year=2002|format=PDF}}</ref>

==Geography==
At {{coor dms|51|6|33|N|0|11|14|W|city}} (51.1092, -0.1872), Crawley is in the northeastern corner of West Sussex in [[South East England]], {{convert|28|mi|km|0|lk=on}} south of [[London]] and {{convert|18|mi|km|0}} north of [[Brighton and Hove]].  It is surrounded by smaller towns including [[Horley]], [[Redhill]], [[Reigate]], [[Dorking]], [[Horsham]], [[Haywards Heath]] and [[East Grinstead]].  The borough of Crawley is bordered by the West Sussex [[local authority|local authority area]]s of Mid Sussex and Horsham districts, and the [[Mole Valley]] and [[Tandridge]] districts and the [[Reigate and Banstead|Borough of Reigate and Banstead]] in the county of [[Surrey]].

Crawley lies in the [[Weald]] between the [[North Downs|North]] and [[South Downs]]. Two geological beds of [[sedimentary rock]]s meet beneath the town: the eastern neighbourhoods and the town centre lie largely on Hastings Sand, while the bulk of the town to the north and west is based on the [[Weald Clay]].<ref name="bgs">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bgs.ac.uk/magazine/geology/home.html?|title=Geology of Britain|accessdate=2007-08-10|publisher=British Geological Survey|year=2007|work=British Geological Survey website}}</ref>  The town has no major waterways, although a number of smaller brooks and streams are tributaries for the [[River Mole, Surrey|River Mole]] which rises near [[London Gatwick Airport|Gatwick Airport]] and runs northwards to the [[River Thames]] near [[Hampton Court Palace]]. There are several lakes at [[Tilgate Park, Crawley|Tilgate Park]], and a mill pond at Ifield which was stopped to feed the Ifield Mill.<ref name="mill">{{Cite web|url=http://www.crawley.gov.uk/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&ssDocName=INT010149|title=Ifield Mill Pond|accessdate=2007-08-10|publisher=Crawley Borough Council|year=2007|work=Crawley Borough Council website}}</ref>  

After Mary Ann Mantell, a doctor's wife, found a [[fossilised]] tooth near the village of [[Cuckfield]] in 1822, her husband [[Gideon Algernon Mantell|Gideon]]—an amateur fossil collector and [[palaeontologist]]—searched quarries and pits in the surrounding area, including Tilgate Forest on the edge of Crawley, and discovered many more remains.  The age of the rock under the forest suggested that the bones and teeth must have come from a pre-[[mammal]]ian creature.  After showing several famous scientists and anatomists, Mantell eventually announced his discovery in an 1825 scientific paper, giving the creature the name [[Iguanadon]]—the world's first officially named [[dinosaur]].<ref name="dino1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.dinohunters.com/Iguanodon/discovery.htm|title=Mantell’s Discovery of Iguanodon|accessdate=2007-08-10|year=2007|work=A History of Dinosaur Hunting and Reconstruction}}</ref>  In 1832, Mantell discovered and named another genus of dinosaurs after finding a fossil in Tilgate Forest.  The [[Hylaeosaurus]] takes the first part of its name from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] for "forest" or "Wealden".<ref name="dino2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.dinohunters.com/History/Hylaeosaurus.htm|title=Hylaeosaurus|accessdate=2008-03-04|year=2007|work=A History of Dinosaur Hunting and Reconstruction}}</ref>

===Climate===
Crawley has a [[temperate]] climate in common with most areas of Great Britain: its [[Koppen climate classification#GROUP C: Temperate/mesothermal climates|Koppen climate classification]] is ''Cfb''.  Its mean annual temperature of 9.6&nbsp;[[Celsius|°C]] is similar to that experienced throughout the Weald, and slightly cooler than nearby areas such as the Sussex coast and Greater London.<ref name="temperature">{{cite web|year = 2001|url = http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/tmean/17.gif|title = Mean Temperature Annual Average|publisher = [[Met Office]]|accessdate = 2007-08-22}}</ref>  Rainfall is considerably below England's average (1971–2000) level of 838 mm, and every month is drier overall than the England average.<ref name="rainmean">{{Cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/areal/england.html|title=Met Office: averages 1971–2000|accessdate=2007-08-22|publisher=Met Office|year=2007|work=Met Office website}}</ref>

There are 13 residential neighbourhoods, each with a variety of housing types: terraced, semi-detached and detached houses, low-rise flats and bungalows.  There are no residential tower blocks.  Many houses have their own gardens and are set back from roads.  Each neighbourhood is based around a shopping parade, community centre and church, with schools and areas of open space also available.<ref name="vicdates">{{Cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=18415|title=Growth of the New Town|accessdate=2007-08-07|publisher=Victoria County History|year=1987|author=Hudson, T.P.

There are areas which are not neighbourhoods but which are closely associated with Crawley:
*The [[Manor Royal, Crawley|Manor Royal]] industrial estate is in the north of the town.  Although it is part of the Northgate ward, it is allocated a colour: its streets feature the word "INDUSTRIAL" on a black background.
*[[Gatwick Airport]] was built on the site of a manor house, Gatwick Manor, close to the village of Lowfield Heath.  Most of the village was demolished when the airport expanded, but some buildings, including the [[Listed building|Grade II*-listed]] St Michael's church,<ref name="StMLH">{{cite web|url=http://www.cofe.anglican.org/about/diocesesparishes/rcsale/lowfieldheath.html|title=Lowfield Heath St Michael|accessdate=2008-03-31|publisher=The Archbishops' Council|year=2007|work=The Church of England website}}</ref> remain.  These lie on the airport's southern boundary, between the perimeter road and the A23 close to Manor Royal.  In the picture, the road to the left, ''Old Brighton Road South'', is truncated abruptly at the airport boundary, a short distance from the runway.
*[[Worth, West Sussex|Worth]] was originally a village with its own civil parish, lying just beyond the eastern edge of the Crawley urban area and borough boundary;<ref>{{cite map |publisher= Ordnance Survey|title= Sheet 187: Dorking, Reigate and Crawley|year= 1980|scale= 1:50,000|series= Landranger Series of Great Britain}}</ref> but development of the Pound Hill and Maidenbower neighbourhoods has filled in the gaps, and the borough boundary has been extended to include the whole of the village.  The civil parish of Worth remains, albeit reduced in size, and it is part of the [[Mid Sussex]] district.

Crawley originally traded as a traditional market town.  The proposals for the new town included plans to develop it as a centre for manufacturing and light engineering, with a dedicated and purpose-built industrial zone.<ref name="econhist"/> The rapid growth of Gatwick Airport provided opportunities for businesses in the aviation, transport, warehousing and distribution industries. The significance of the airport in terms of local employment and enterprise is recognised in the formation of the Gatwick Diamond partnership which recognises the airport as a hub of employment and economic growth.<ref name="gatdiamond">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gatwickdiamond.co.uk/|title=The Gatwick Diamond|accessdate=2007-08-02|publisher=West Sussex Economic Partnership|year=2007|work=Gatwick Diamond website}}</ref>

===Manufacturing industry===
Crawley was already a modest industrial centre by the end of the Second World War.  Building was an important trade: 800 people were employed by building and joinery firms, and two—Longley's and Cook's—were large enough to have their own factories.<ref name="fredgray"/>  In 1949, 1,529 people worked in manufacturing, with light and precision engineering and aircraft repair being the main industries.  Many of the jobs in these industries were highly skilled.<ref name="fredgray"/><ref name="econhist"/>

Industrial development had to take place relatively early in the life of the new town because part of the Corporation's remit was to move people and jobs out of an overcrowded and war-damaged London.  Industrial jobs were needed as well as houses and shops to create a balanced community where people could settle.<ref name="NTA1946"/>  The Development Corporation wanted the new town to support a large and mixed industrial base, with factories and other buildings based in a single zone rather than spread throughout the town.

[[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Princess Elizabeth]] (later Queen Elizabeth II) opened the first part of the industrial area on [[25 January]] [[1950]];<ref name="miscellany"/> its main road was named Manor Royal, and this name eventually came to refer to the whole estate.<ref name="econhist"/>  

The Corporation stipulated that several different [[Secondary sector of economic activity|manufacturing industries]] should be developed, rather than allowing one sector or firm to dominate.  It did not seek to attract companies by offering financial or other incentives; instead, it set out to create the ideal conditions for industrial development to arise naturally, by providing large plots of land with room for expansion, allowing firms to build their own premises or to rent ready-made buildings, and constructing a wide range of building types and sizes.<ref name="fredgray"/><ref name="econhist"/>

Despite the lack of direct incentives, many firms applied to move to the Manor Royal estate: it was considered such an attractive place to relocate to that the Development Corporation was able to choose between applicants to achieve the ideal mix of firms, and little advertising or promotion had to be undertaken.  One year after Manor Royal was opened, eighteen firms were trading there, including four with more than 100 employees and one with more than 1,000.<ref name="econhist"/>  By 1964, businesses which had moved to the town since 1950 employed 16,000 people; the master plan had anticipated between 8,000 and 8,500.  Nearly 20,000 were employed in 105 "new" firms in 1978.<ref name="fredgray"/><ref name="econhist"/>

===Service industry and commerce===
While most of the new jobs created in the new town's early years were in manufacturing, the [[Tertiary sector of economic activity|tertiary sector]] developed strongly from the 1960s onwards.  The Manor Royal estate, with its space, proximity to Gatwick and good transport links, attracted airport-related services such as logistics, catering, distribution and warehousing; and the Corporation and private companies built many offices throughout the town.

===Shopping and retail===
[[Image:Crawley - High Street (N).JPG|thumb|right|Crawley High Street looking north, with the Saturday market in operation]]

Even before the new town was planned, Crawley had local importance as a retail centre: there were 177 shops in the town in 1948,<ref name="fredgray"/> 99 of which were on the High Street.<ref name="econhist"/>  Its significance grew as the Corporation developed the town centre as a major shopping venue: 150 new shops were provided on previously mostly undeveloped land to the east of the High Street and north of the railway line.<ref name="NTA1946"/>  Its main intention was to integrate the town centre development closely with the surrounding residential neighbourhoods, so that relatively few (and basic) shops would be required in the neighbourhoods themselves, and to maintain the character and ambience of the old High Street.<ref name="13years"/><ref name="NTA1946"/>

Early new town residents relied on the existing shopping facilities until the building of The Broadwalk in 1954, with 23 shops, and then the Queen's Square complex and surrounding streets in the mid-1950s.<ref name="vicdates"/>.  Queen's Square, a pedestrianised plaza surrounded by large shops and linked to the High Street by The Broadwalk, was officially opened in 1958 by Queen Elizabeth II.<ref name="fredgray"/>  The town centre was completed by 1960, by which time Crawley was already recognised as an important regional, rather than merely local, shopping centre.

[[Image:Crawley - County Mall (Friary Way Entrance).JPG|thumb|left|The Friary Way entrance to County Mall]]

Developments between the 1960s and the 1980s included the opening of large branches of [[Tesco]] (Britain's largest at the time), [[Sainsbury's]] and [[Marks & Spencer]]; and an expansion southeastwards from Queen's Square, providing a pedestrianised link (The Martlets) and several large shop units—although the original plans of 1975 were scaled back.<ref name="econhist"/>  The remaining land between this area and the railway line was sold for private development by 1982;<ref name="econhist"/> this came to fruition in 1992, when a {{convert|450000|sqft|sqm|-2}}<ref name="CMsize">{{Cite web|url=http://www.propertymall.com/press/article/433|title=Propertymall.com: Crawley, County Mall Shopping Centre|accessdate=2007-09-05|publisher=MaxiMalls.com Ltd|year=2007|work=www.propertymall.com}}</ref> shopping centre named County Mall was opened.<ref name="mall">{{Cite web|url=http://www.propertyweek.com/story.asp?storyCode=3047252|title=The magnetic North|accessdate=2007-08-21|publisher=Property Week|date=2005-02-25|author=Christine Ease|work=www.propertyweek.com}}</ref> The mall is home to major retailers such as [[Debenhams]], [[Alliance Boots|Boots]], [[W H Smith]] and [[Bhs|British Home Stores]] as well as over 80 smaller outlets.<ref name="shops">{{Cite web|url=http://www.standardlifeweb.co.uk/retailerslist.php?user=countymall&all=true|title=Shopping|accessdate=2007-08-21|publisher=Standard Life Property|year=2007|work=www.countymall.co.uk}}</ref>  The town's main bus station was redesigned, roads including the main A2220 Haslett Avenue were rerouted, and some buildings at the south end of The Martlets were demolished to accommodate the mall.

Provision of water services varies across the town. While all waste water and sewerage provision is made by [[Thames Water]], residents in most parts of the town receiving supply from [[Southern Water]]; areas in the north of the town around [[London Gatwick Airport|Gatwick Airport]] are provided by Sutton & East Surrey Water; and South East Water supplies the [[Maidenbower, Crawley|Maidenbower]] area.<ref name="water">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thameswater.co.uk/en_gb/Downloads/Flash_Documents/map.swf|title=Thames Water Service Area Map|accessdate=2008-02-22|publisher=Thames Water|year=2008|work=Thames Water website|format=SWF}}</ref>

The provision of public services was made in co-operation with the local authorities as the town grew in the 1950s and 1960s.

==Transport==
Crawley's early development as a market town was helped by its location on the London–Brighton [[turnpike]].  The area was joined to the [[Rail transport in Great Britain|railway network]] in the mid-19th century; and since the creation of the new town, there have been major road upgrades (including a [[motorway]] link), a [[guided bus]] transit system and the establishment of an [[airport]] which has become one of Britain's largest and busiest.

===Road===
[[Image:M23_Motorway_West_Sussex.jpg|thumb|right|The M23 motorway between Junctions 9 and 10]]

The London–Brighton turnpike ran through the centre of Crawley, forming the High Street and Station Road.  When Britain's major roads were classified by the British government's Ministry of Transport between 1919 and 1923,<ref name="cbrdhistory">{{cite web |url= http://www.cbrd.co.uk/indepth/roadnumbers/history.shtml|title=CBRD In Depth: Road Numbers—How it happened|accessdate=2008-03-31|publisher=Chris Marshall|year=2001|work=CBRD website}}</ref> it was given the number [[A23 road|A23]].  This was bypassed first by a new dual carriageway in 1939 (which forms the A23's current route through the town), and then later to the east side of the town by the [[M23 motorway]], which was opened in 1975.  This connects London's orbital motorway, the [[M25 motorway|M25]], to the A23 at [[Pease Pottage]], at the southern edge of Crawley's built-up area.  The original A23, a single-carriageway road, became the A2219.  

As well as the junction (11) at Pease Pottage, where the motorway ends, the M23 has junctions in the Crawley area at Maidenbower (10A) and the A2011/[[A264 road|A264]] (10).  The A2011, another dual-carriageway, joins the A23 in West Green, and provides a link, via the A2004, to the town centre.  The A2220 follows the former route of the A264 through the town, linking the A23 directly to the A264 at [[Copthorne, West Sussex|Copthorne]], from where it then runs to [[East Grinstead]].

===Rail===
[[Image:Crawley Station 01 (07-07-2007).JPG|thumb|left|Crawley station, with five storeys of offices above the ticket office and concourse area]]

The first railway line in the area was the [[Brighton Main Line]], which opened as far as [[Haywards Heath]] on [[12 July]] [[1841]].  It ran through Three Bridges, which was then a small village east of Crawley, and [[Three Bridges railway station|a station]] was built to serve it.

A line to [[Horsham]], now part of the [[Arun Valley Line]], was opened on [[14 February]] [[1848]], with [[Crawley railway station|a station]] being provided at Crawley from that date.  This was built next to the High Street.  A new station was constructed slightly to the east, in conjunction with the Overline House commercial development, and replaced the original station which closed on [[28 July]] [[1968]].  The ticket office and Up (London-bound) platform waiting areas form the ground floor of the office building.<ref>{{cite book |last= Body|first= Geoffrey|authorlink= |coauthors= |title= PSL Field Guide: Railways of the Southern Region|year= 1984|publisher= Patrick Stephens Ltd|location= Cambridge|isbn= 0-85059-664-5|pages= page 75}}</ref>

[[Ifield railway station]] is within the Crawley urban area.  Opened as ''Lyons Crossing Halt'' on [[1 June]] [[1907]] to serve the village of Ifield, it was soon renamed ''Ifield Halt'', dropping the "Halt" suffix in 1930.

Regular train services run to [[London Victoria station|London Victoria]] and [[London Bridge station|London Bridge]] stations, Gatwick Airport, [[Croydon]], [[Tunbridge Wells]], [[Horsham]], [[Littlehampton]], [[Bognor Regis]], [[Chichester]] and [[Portsmouth]].  Three Bridges has direct links with Brighton.

===Bus and Fastway===
Early bus routes in the town were provided from services in London and Surrey. With the break up of the [[National Bus Company (UK)|National Bus Company]], local services were provided by [[London Country Bus Services|London Country]], later part of the [[Arriva]] group.
Since March 2001, the majority of local bus services in Crawley have been operated by [[Metrobus (bus company)|Metrobus]], following their acquisition of garaging from the Arriva group who ceased operations from Crawley at that time.<ref name="goahead">{{Cite web|url=http://www.go-ahead.com/Main.php?sFileName=NewsRelease.php&iNewsId=130&s|title=Acquisition of Crawley Depot|accessdate=2007-07-31|publisher=Go Ahead Group|year=2001|work=Go Ahead Group website}}</ref> The company operates local services between the neighbourhoods and town centre, as well as longer-distance routes to [[Horsham]], [[Redhill]], [[Tunbridge Wells]], [[Worthing]] and [[Brighton]].<ref name="buses">{{Cite web|url=http://www.metrobus.co.uk/service_index.php|title=Timetables & Route Index|accessdate=2007-07-31|publisher=Go Ahead Group|year=2007|work=Metrobus Website}}</ref>

===Gatwick Airport===
{{main|London Gatwick Airport}}
Gatwick Airport was originally opened as a private airfield in the 1930s. It was used during the [[World War II|Second World War]] as an [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] base, returning to civil use in 1946. There were proposals to close the airport by the late 1940s, but these were altered. It closed in 1956 to enable it to be rebuilt as a second airport for London. The new airport was opened by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty The Queen]] on [[9 June]] [[1958]]. A second terminal, the North Terminal, was opened in 1988.<ref name="baa">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gatwickairport.com/portal/controller/dispatcher.jsp?CiID=0fcae327ea262010VgnVCM100000147e120a____&ChID=594e1fb079432010VgnVCM100000147e120a____&Ct=B2C_CT_GENERAL&CtID=448c6a4c7f1b0010VgnVCM200000357e120a____&ChPath=Home%5ELGW%5EAbout+BAA+Gatwick%5EGatwick+lowdown%5EOur+history|title=Our History|accessdate=2007-08-01|publisher=BAA plc|year=2006|work=BAA Gatwick Airport website}}</ref>
An agreement exists between [[BAA plc]] and West Sussex County Council preventing the building of a further runway until 2019. Nevertheless, consultations were launched in 2002 by the [[Department for Transport]] which included possible proposals for the building of additional facilities and runways at the airport. The result of the consultation was to preclude any further expansion at Gatwick unless it was impossible to meet growth targets at [[London Heathrow Airport]] within existing pollution limits.<ref name="dft">{{Cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/archive/2002/fd/|title=The future development of air transport in the UK|accessdate=2007-08-01|publisher=Department for Transport|year=2003|work=Department for Transport website}}</ref>

==Sport and leisure==
[[Image:Crawley - Entrance to Broadfield Stadium.JPG|thumb|right|Entrance to the Broadfield Stadium]]

There were many sports clubs which predated the new town.  [[Crawley Town F.C.]], formed in 1896, moved in 1949 to a ground at Town Mead adjacent to the [[West Green]] playing fields. Demand for land near the town centre led to the club moving in 1997 to the new [[Broadfield Stadium]], now owned by the borough council.<ref name="ctfc">{{Cite web|url=http://www.crawleytownfc.net/page.php?pageid=37|title=Crawley Town Football Club - past and present|accessdate=2007-08-02|year=2007|work=Crawley Town Football Club website}}</ref> As of the [[2007-08 in English football|2007/2008 season]], Crawley Town play in the [[Football Conference|Blue Square Premier]], the highest level of non-league competition in England.
