'''''Haunting The Chapel''''' is an [[Extended play|EP]] by the [[thrash metal]] band [[Slayer]]. It was released in 1984 through [[Metal Blade Records]]. Although originally only featuring three songs, the record evidences a marked evolution from the style of their debut album, ''[[Show No Mercy]]'', and is considered the first demonstration of the band's "classic" style displayed on later albums.

The band has regularly performed the songs ''Captor of Sin'' and ''Chemical Warfare'' live since the EP's release, with the latter typically closing their setlist.

==Recording==
Slayer's previous album ''Show No Mercy'' had sold over 40,000 copies worldwide and the band were performing the songs "Chemical Warfare" and "Captor of Sin" live, which made producer [[Brian Slagel]] want to release an [[EP]].<ref name="INTERVIEW WITH BRIAN SLAGEL">{{cite web

Slayer drummer [[Dave Lombardo]] set his drum kit on the concrete and the kit went "all over the place" while playing. Lombardo asked [[Gene Hoglan]] to hold his kit together, while recording "Chemical Warfare", with Hoglan thinking "I hope he does this in one or two takes, because this is rough."<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer">{{cite web| title = An exclusive oral history of Slayer| publisher = Decibel Magazine| url = http://www.decibelmagazine.com/features_detail.aspx?id=4566| accessdate = 2006-12-03 }}</ref> Hoglan was coaching Lombardo how to use [[double-bass]] drums to improve his drumming ability and speed, Lombardo asserts Hoglan was "an amazing double-bass player even back then."<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/>

==Touring==
Hoglan worked as a [[roadie]] for the band after their lighting guy did not show up one night, and performed Lombardo's [[soundcheck]]s.<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/> Slayer and Hoglan would play [[Dark Angel (band)|Dark Angel]] songs during soundchecks, which is how Hoglan eventually joined Dark Angel. Hoglan approached Dark Angel guitarist Jim Durkin: "He came up to me one day and started giving me his criticisms of the band. He said we needed to be more evil. And then he goes, 'By the way, I’m a better drummer than the guy you have in Dark Angel right now.'"<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/>

Hoglan was fired as he thought a roadie only did lighting, while vocalist [[Tom Araya]]'s brother [[Johnny Araya]] would do all roadie duties, such as moving equipment, working with sound and lights, and setting up the stage.<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/> The band performed a show in Seattle in front of a crowd of 1500, the largest show they performed at the time, supporting [[Metal Church]], and in Texas played with the San Antonio Slayer, which was their goodbye show.<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/>
