''Metal Gear Solid''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s story centers on [[Solid Snake]], a retired soldier who infiltrates a [[nuclear weapon]]s disposal facility to neutralize the terrorist threat from [[FOXHOUND]], a renegade [[special forces]] unit.<ref>'''Colonel Campbell''': Next-Generation Special Forces led by members of unit FOX-HOUND.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:MGS screen psx.jpg|left|thumb||200 px|Solid Snake hiding from a guard.]] 

Despite graphical improvements, ''Metal Gear Solid''<nowiki></nowiki>'s gameplay remains similar to its [[MSX#MSX 2|MSX2]] predecessor ''Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake''. The player must navigate the [[protagonist]] Solid Snake through the game's areas without being detected<ref>{{cite web | title=Metal Gear Solid | url=http://psx.ign.com/objects/000/000569.html | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessmonthday=October 22 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> — detection sets off an alarm, which draws armed enemies to his location. To return to a lower alert setting, the player must hide, and remain undetected by the enemy until a timer reaches zero.<ref name="gs1">{{cite web | author=Kasavin, Greg | title=Metal Gear Solid (PC) review | url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/adventure/metalgearsolid/review.html | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | date=[[October 2]], [[2000]] | accessmonthday=July 7 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

To remain undetected, the player can perform techniques which make use of Solid Snake's abilities and the environment, such as crawling under objects, using boxes as cover, ducking or hiding around walls, and making noise to distract the enemy. These are carried out using the [[Third-person shooter|third-person camera]]; which slowly changes its angle to give the player the best strategic view of the area possible, and an on-screen [[radar]], which displays enemy personnel and their field of vision.<ref name="gsguide">{{cite web | author=Mielke, James | title=Metal Gear Solid Strategy Guide | url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/vgs/psx/mgs_gg/ | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | accessmonthday=November 15 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Solid Snake is armed with many items and gadgets, such as [[Thermography|thermal goggles]] and a [[cardboard box]] disguise.<ref>{{cite web | author=House, Matthew | title=Metal Gear Solid – Overview | url=http://www.allgame.com/cg/agg.dll?p=agg&sql=1:14082 | publisher=[[All Game Guide]] | accessmonthday=October 22 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> This emphasis on stealth promotes a less violent form of gameplay — [[Battle|firefights]] against large enemy teams will likely result in heavy damage and possible death for the protagonist.<ref name="manual">{{cite web | title=Metal Gear Solid PC – Instructional Manual | url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/b/1/8/b180af00-6eae-490e-88d6-71ec4f4af01a/metalgearsolid_booklet_EN.pdf | publisher=[[Konami]] / [[Microsoft]] | accessmonthday=July 7 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

Intermixed with the player's progress are plot-progressing [[cut scene]]s and [[Receiver (radio)|radio]] conversations as well as encounters with [[Boss (video games)|boss characters]]. To progress, players must discover weaknesses of these enemies (such as attack patterns) to defeat them. This is where the player will most often use the game's weapon-set, ranging from [[pistol]]s to [[Shoulder-launched missile weapon|rocket launchers]] and [[hand grenade]]s.<ref name="gsguide" /> Game controls and play strategies can also be accessed via the Codec radio, where advice is delivered from Snake's support crew as if the character were playing the video game; for example, the support team may chastise Snake for not saving his progress often enough, or explain his combat moves in terms of which buttons to press on the gamepad. Completion of the title provides the player with a statistical summary of their performance, and a "code name" based upon it, typically the common name of an animal.

In a first for the ''Metal Gear'' series, a training mode is available in which players can practice hiding techniques, weapons use, and sneaking.<ref name="gameguide">{{cite book | year=1999 | editor=Konami staff | title=Metal Gear Solid instruction manual | pages=49 | publisher=Konami | language=English | id=SLES-01370}}</ref> In addition to the stealth gameplay, there are [[Set piece|set-piece]] sequences that entail firefights between the player and the enemy from the third-person and [[First person shooter|first-person]] perspectives.<ref name="gameguide" />

===Plot===
[[Image:Metal Gear Solid - Metal Gear REX.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Solid Snake in battle against [[Metal Gear REX]]]]
In 2005 (six years <!-- note: this refers to Metal Gear 2, not Metal Gear Solid 2 -->after the events of ''Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake''),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.konami.jp/gs/game/mgs3_sub/america/mgs/saga.html|title=Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence website – Metal Gear Saga vol. 1 section|accessdate=January 12|accessyear=2006}}</ref> FOXHOUND and the genetically-enhanced Next-Generation Special Forces unit lead an armed uprising at Shadow Moses, a remote isle located in [[Alaska]]'s [[Fox Islands (Alaska)|Fox Archipelago]] and the site of a nuclear weapons disposal facility.<ref name="manual" /> In the process, they acquire Metal Gear REX, a nuclear-capable [[mecha|bipedal tank]], threatening the U.S. government with a nuclear reprisal if they do not receive the remains of the "legendary mercenary" [[Big Boss (Metal Gear)|Big Boss]].<ref name="history1">{{cite web | author=Shoemaker, Brad | title=GameSpot's The History of MetalGear | url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/mg_history/ | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | accessmonthday=October 22 |accessyear=2006}}</ref> Solid Snake, in retirement at Alaska's [[Twin Lakes (Alaska)|Twin Lakes]],<ref>'''Snake:''' Colonel, I don't work for the government anymore. Let me go back to Twin Lakes. ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref> is forcibly dispatched at the request of Colonel Roy Campbell to penetrate the terrorist defenses and neutralize the threat.<ref>{{cite web | author=Stratosphere | title=Metal Gear Solid Brief Synopsis  | url=http://metalgearsolid.org/show_features.php?id=461 | work=[http://www.metalgearsolid.org/ Metal Gear Solid: The Unofficial Site] | accessmonthday=October 22 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

Solid Snake first locates hostage [[List of Metal Gear Solid characters#Donald Anderson|Donald Anderson]], the DARPA chief. After he informs Snake of Metal Gear REX's deactivation procedure,<ref>'''DARPA chief:''' … you can just insert the card keys and engage the safety lock '''Snake:''' And if I do that? '''DARPA chief:''' Yes. You can stop the launch ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref> he mysteriously dies of what appears to be a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]].<ref>'''Master Miller:''' The cause of death. Didn't the ArmsTech president and the DARPA Chief, I mean Decoy Octopus,… die of something that looked like a heart attack? ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref> Following a brief encounter with Meryl Silverburgh, who aids their escape from the base prison, Snake continues on to find the other hostage, ArmsTech president [[List of Metal Gear Solid characters#Kenneth Baker|Kenneth Baker]]. He is used as bait by Revolver Ocelot, and Snake is challenged to a gunfight, interrupted by the arrival of a mysterious cyborg ninja who severs Ocelot's arm before escaping. Snake is again briefed on the Metal Gear project by Baker; much like the DARPA Chief, he dies of a sudden heart attack just before revealing key information. 

Snake then contacts Meryl via Codec, and agrees to meet her in the base's warhead disposal area on the condition he contact Metal Gear's designer, Hal "Otacon" Emmerich. While searching for him, he encounters the giant Vulcan Raven in an [[M1 Abrams]] tank, which he swiftly disables, and locates Otacon in his lab. The cyborg ninja Snake previously encountered reappears, and after a hand-to-hand battle reveals himself to be Solid Snake's former ally [[List of recurring Metal Gear characters#Gray Fox|Gray Fox]], who Snake believed he had killed years earlier. Before they can settle their score, the ninja vanishes again. Otacon, while safe, is unaware that Metal Gear is to be used as a nuclear delivery system, and breaks down when Snake informs him that he is continuing his family's close involvement with the US nuclear program. He agrees to aid Snake remotely, using special [[camouflage]] to procure information and supplies while remaining unseen. Snake then meets Meryl, and they discuss their differing roles as soldiers. Meryl having joined the military to feel closer to her father, an Army officer killed in action. Ultimately he allows her to accompany him on his mission. Their reunion is brief, and when she is being telepathically coerced by Psycho Mantis to attack Snake,<ref>'''Naomi:''' It's Psycho Mantis. He's controlling Meryl. That tune is his mind control music. ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref> Snake defeats him by plugging the PlayStation controller into a different port, preventing Psycho Mantis from reading his mind. After they defeated Psycho Mantis, Sniper Wolf ambushes them, wounding and capturing Meryl and eventually Snake in a sniper duel.

While imprisoned, Liquid confirms Snake's suspicion that they are twin brothers.<ref>Liquid: Were both the last surviving sons of Big Boss…</ref>  He hands Snake over to Ocelot, who tortures him,<ref>'''Liquid:''' (to Ocelot) We're shorthanded, so make this little torture show of yours as short as possible. ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref> but Snake quickly escapes, and after being chased to the top of the base's Communications Tower, he encounters Liquid again, in a [[Mil Mi-24|Hind-D attack helicopter]]. Despite being outgunned, Snake shoots it down,<ref>'''Snake:''' Oh, I had to take out that helicopter. ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref> and upon descending the tower is yet again ambushed by Sniper Wolf, and kills her following a second duel. Otacon, enamored with her, is overwhelmed with grief, but continues to assist Snake.

Snake descends into the bowels of the Shadow Moses facility, first cutting through the base forge then down into the warehouses below. Here he encounters Raven again, this time face-to-face, and kills him. Before he dies, Raven reveals that the DARPA Chief who Snake encountered was actually FOXHOUND member Decoy Octopus in disguise.<ref>'''Raven:''' That was not the DARPA Chief. It was Decoy Octopus. ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref> Shortly after, Master Miller calls and reveals that Dr. Naomi Hunter, a support agent, had given Solid Snake the genetically engineered virus "FoxDie" during his mission preparations, and is sending coded messages into the facility- Campbell swiftly orders her arrest. The virus, designed to kill people with particular genetic markers via cardiac arrest,<ref>'''Master Miller:''' Snake, have you ever heard of something called "Fox Die"? It's some kind of virus that targets specific people. ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref><ref>'''Master Miller:''' Snake, try to remember. Did Naomi give you some kind of injection? She was in the best position to have done it, but I don't know what her motive was. ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref> was responsible for the deaths of Octopus and the Armstech president.<ref>'''Master Miller:''' Didn't the ArmsTech president and the DARPA Chief, I mean Decoy Octopus,… die of something that looked like a heart attack? Well, apparently Fox Die kills its victims by simulating a heart attack. ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref> Naomi, struck by guilt, contacts Snake in secret and confesses that she joined the mission to sabotage it, as she is the adoptive sister of the now barely human Gray Fox. However, upon learning of Snake's own tragic past through the current mission, she no longer has the heart to kill him directly, having reprogrammed the virus.<ref>'''Naomi Hunter''' You killed my benefactor and sent my brother home a cripple. ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref>

Infiltrating Metal Gear's hangar and following the supposed procedure to disarm the warhead, Snake unknowingly activates Metal Gear REX,<ref>'''Computer:''' PAL code number three confirmed. PAL code entry complete… ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref> after which Master Miller reveals himself to be Liquid in disguise. He informs Snake that his entire mission was manipulated by the renegades to allow the launch of the nuclear weapon.<ref>'''Campbell:''' Snake, you've been talking to… '''Liquid:''' …Me… dear brother. ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref> As a parting gift as he boards REX, Liquid explains that they are the product of the 1972 [[Les Enfants Terribles (Metal Gear Solid)|Les Enfants Terribles]] project, a government sponsored effort to [[Clone (genetics)|clone]] legendary mercenary Big Boss. However, part of the process requires that their genes be altered, Solid receiving all of Big Boss' dominant genes, and Liquid receiving all the recessive genes.<ref>It is for this purpose that we were created! Snake: Created? Liquid: Yes, created, Les Enfantes Terrible…the terrible children. Clones of Big Boss</ref><ref>'''Snake:''' You mean you had this planned from the beginning? Just to get me to input the detonation code? ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref> 

Drawn into battle with Metal Gear REX, Snake manages to disable the machine's sensors with the aid of Otacon, and Gray Fox (who admits to being "Deepthroat") manages to destroy its radome, but is wounded and crushed by its foot. REX is destroyed, but Liquid survives, challenging Snake to a final fist-fight atop Metal Gear, where Snake succeeds and is reunited with Meryl- possibly for the final time, depending on the player's actions (see below). After a protracted jeep-chase with the seemingly unkillable Liquid, Snake finally escapes the facility, and his brother collapses, killed by FoxDie.<ref>'''Snake:''' Naomi, Liquid died from Fox Die too. ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref> Colonel Campbell, briefly ousted from command of the mission, calls off a nuclear airstrike intended to obliterate the evidence of the day's events, and officially declares Snake killed in action to prevent the US Government returning for him in the future. In the immediate aftermath, the player finds out Snake is actually genetically inferior to Liquid<ref>'''Ocelot:''' Until the very end, Liquid thought he was the inferior one. ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref> and has an indeterminate amount of time left before FoxDie kills him.<ref>'''Ocelot:''' The vector? Yes sir, FoxDie should become activated soon… ''(Metal Gear Solid)''</ref>

Depending on the player's actions during the game, there are two possible endings: in one ending, Ocelot kills Meryl and Snake escapes with Otacon, while in the other ending, she survives and escapes with Snake. Meryl's survival is recorded as canon by ''In the Darkness of Shadow Moses'', a story featured in ''Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty''. A telephone conversation following the credits reveals Ocelot to be a double agent for the [[President of the United States]], the third Snake [[List of Metal Gear Solid 2 characters#Solidus Snake (George W. Sears)|Solidus]]. Ocelot's intention was to gain Baker's disk containing Metal Gear's specifications and deliver it to the President.

==Development==
Development for ''Metal Gear Solid'' began in [[1995 in video gaming|1995]]<ref>{{cite web | author=GameSpot staff | title=Metal Gear Solid Comes to the Nintendo 64 | url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/2466851.html | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | date=[[June 17]], [[1997]] | accessmonthday=July 7 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> with the intent of creating the "best PlayStation game ever."<ref name="gsold" /> Developers aimed for accuracy and realism while making the game enjoyable and tense. In the early stages of development, a [[SWAT]] team educated the creators with a demonstration of vehicles, weapons and explosives.<ref name="gsold">{{cite web | author=Bartholow, Peter | title=Metal Gear Solid Casts Its Spell | url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/2467579.html | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | accessmonthday=July 7 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> [[Hideo Kojima]], the director, stated that "if the player isn't tricked into believing that the world is real, then there's no point in making the game". To fulfill this, adjustments were made to every detail, such as individually designed desks.<ref>{{cite web | author=IGN staff | title=More News From Metal Gear Solid Creator | url=http://psx.ign.com/articles/064/064632p1.html | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessmonthday=November 14 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

The characters of ''Metal Gear Solid'' were created by Hideo Kojima; modifications and mechanics were made by conceptual artist [[Yoji Shinkawa]]. The characters were completed by polygonal artists using pencil drawings and clay models by Shinkawa.<ref>{{cite web | author=IGN staff | title=The Art of Design: MGS2 & Z.O.E. | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/088/088856p1.html | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessmonthday=November 14 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> 

Despite being the third ''Metal Gear'' title (not including the non-canonical ''[[Snake's Revenge]]''), Kojima chose the name ''Metal Gear Solid'' over ''Metal Gear 3'' due to the relative obscurity of the first two games. The word ''Solid'' refers to the game being the third installment in the series, and also because the game uses [[3D computer graphics]].<ref name="kent">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamerstoday.com/world_tour/kojima/index.html | title=Hideo Kojima: Game Guru, Movie Maniac | author = Kent, Steven | publisher = Gamers Today | accessmonthday=July 7 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> The subsequent sequels in the series also bear the ''Metal Gear Solid'' title, following a new numeral progression.

Hideo Kojima wanted greater interaction with objects and the environment, such as allowing the player to hide bodies in a storage compartment. Additionally, he wanted "a full orchestra right next to the player"; a system which made modifications (such as [[tempo]] and [[texture (music)|texture]]) to the currently playing track, instead of switching to another pre-recorded track. Although these features could not be achieved, they were implemented in ''Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty''.<ref>{{cite web | author=IGN staff | title=E3: Hideo Kojima Interview | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/079/079352p1.html | publisher=[[IGN]] | date=[[May 15]], [[2000]] | accessmonthday=July 13 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

''Metal Gear Solid'' was revealed to the public at the [[E3]] gaming event in 1997 as a short video. It was later playable for the first time at the [[Tokyo Game Show]] in 1998 and officially released the same year in [[Japan]]<!--dead link--><ref>{{cite web | author=Grant | title=The Metal Gear Timeline | url=http://www.classicgaming.com/metalgear/history.html | work=[http://www.classicgaming.com/metalgear The Metal Gear Edge] | accessmonthday=November 14 |accessyear=2006}}</ref> with an extensive promotional campaign.<ref name="gsold" /> [[Television advertisement|Television]] and [[magazine]] advertisements, in-store samples, and [[Game demo|demo]] give-aways contributed to a total of [[United States dollar|US$]]8 million in promotional costs.<ref>{{cite web | author=GameSpot staff | date=[[October 16]], [[1998]] | title=Metal Gear Gears Up | url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/2465034.html | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | accessmonthday=July 7 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> An estimated 12 million demos for the game were distributed during 1998.<ref>{{cite press release | title=Details announced on massive marketing campaign for Konami's Metal Gear Solid | publisher=Konami / M2 Presswire | date=[[October 19]], [[1998]]}}</ref><!-- LexisNexis 2007-12-31 -->
