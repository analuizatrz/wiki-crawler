'''The Dow Chemical Company''' ({{nyse|DOW}} {{tyo|4850}}) is an [[United States|American]] [[multinational corporation]] headquartered in [[Midland, Michigan]].

==Overview==
The Dow Chemical Company is currently the second largest chemical manufacturer in the World (after BASF)[http://www.hoovers.com/Dow%20Chemical/--ID__10471--/freeuk-co-factsheet.xhtml]. Dow Chemical is the leading Company and major provider of plastics, chemicals, and agricultural products. With presence in 156 Countries and more than 45,000 employees around the world, Dow is one of the top world companies in innovation and  research and development,{{fact}} with more than $1 billion annual expenditure in R&D and the single largest concentation of PhD and Engineers in the United States.{{fact}} Its vision under the current CEO, Mr. Andrew Liveris, is to contribute to create a better world.

The company was founded in 1897 by Canadian-born chemist [[Herbert Henry Dow]], who had invented a new method of extracting the [[bromine]] that was trapped underground in [[brine]] at Midland, Michigan.<ref>{{cite website | url=http://www.invent.org/hall_of_fame/45.html | title=Hall of Fame Inventor Profile | publisher=National Inventors Hall of Fame | accessed=June 24, 2006}}</ref> While at first the company sold only [[bleach]] and [[potassium bromide]], Dow today has seven major operating segments, with a wide variety of products offered by each.<ref>{{cite website | url=http://www.dow.com/about/aboutdow/profile/CorpProfile2006.pdf | title=Corporate Profile | publisher=The Dow Chemical Company | accessed=June 24, 2006}}</ref> The company's 2005 sales totaled [[United States dollar|$]]46.3 billion, with a net income of $4.5 billion. Traded on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], as of 2005 Dow has about 105,000 shareholders.<ref>{{cite website | url=http://news.dow.com/dow_news/press/pre_fast.htm | title=Fast Facts | publisher=The Dow Chemical Company | accessed=June 24, 2006}}</ref>

While Dow has a world wide presence both financially and due to product coverage, most consumers are aware of the company from press-releases rather than product usage.  In recent times, Dow has been called a "Chemical companies' Chemical company" in that most of their product is sold to other manufacturers rather than to end users.  Dow had periods of selling into the Human and Animal Health markets as well as into the Consumer Products market (the latter most visible with Saran Wrap), but all of these facilities have been sold over the years.

Dow Chemical is an active member of the American Chemical Association, and an active partner in different programs and initiatives in both the World Bank and United Nations.

== Products ==
Dow is the world's largest producer of [[plastic]]s, including [[polystyrene]], [[polyurethane]]s, [[polyethylene]], [[polypropylene]], and synthetic [[rubber]]s.  It is also a major producer of the chemicals [[calcium chloride]], [[ethylene oxide]], and various [[acrylate]]s, [[surfactant]]s, and [[cellulose]] resins.  It produces many agricultural chemicals, perhaps being most famous for its [[pesticide]] [[Lorsban]].<ref>{{cite website | url=http://www.dow.com/about/aboutdow/profile/CorpProfile2006.pdf | title=Corporate Profile | publisher=The Dow Chemical Company | accessed=June 24, 2006}}</ref>  Its most well-known [[consumer products]] include [[Styrofoam|Styrofoam brand insulation]]. Two former Dow product lines, [[Saran (plastic)|Saran]] wrap and [[Ziploc]] bags, have been sold to [[S. C. Johnson & Son]].

===Performance plastics===

Performance Plastics make up 25% of Dow's sales<ref>''Chemical and Engineering News'', Vol. 84, Issue 22 (May 29, 2006), pp 10-15</ref>, with many products designed for the [[automotive industry|automotive]] and [[construction industry|construction industries]].  The [[plastic]]s include [[polyolefin]]s such as [[polyethylene]] and [[polypropylene]], as well as the [[polystyrene]] most often seen in [[Styrofoam]]<sup>[[Trademark|TM]]</sup> insulating material.  A complete range of [[epoxy]] resin intermediates and products are manufactured by Dow, including [[bisphenol A]] and [[epichlorohydrin]].  [[Polyurethane]], polyether polyols and specialty [[acrylate]]s are all derived from [[ethylene oxide]] (EO).  The [[Saran]]<sup>TM</sup> range of resins and films is based on [[polyvinylidene chloride]] (PVDC).

===Performance chemicals===

The Performance Chemicals (17% of sales) segment produces materials for [[water purification]], [[pharmaceutical]]s, paper [[coating]]s, paints and advanced [[electronics industry|electronics]].  Major product lines include nitroparaffins such as [[nitromethane]], used in the pharmaceutical industry and manufactured by the Angus Chemical Company<ref>{{cite website | url=http://www.dow.com/angus/ | title=Angus Chemical Company | publisher= The Dow Chemical Company | accessed=June 26, 2006}}</ref>, a Dow subsidiary.   Important polymers include Dowex<sup>TM</sup> [[ion exchange resin]]s, [[acrylic]] and polystyrene [[latex]], as well as Carbowax<sup>TM</sup> [[polyethylene glycol]]s.  Specialty chemicals are used as starting materials for production of agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals.

===Agricultural sciences===

Agricultural Sciences provides 7% of sales, and are responsible for a range of [[insecticide]] s (such as [[Lorsban]]<sup>TM</sup>) and [[fungicide]]s.  Genetically modified plant seeds are also an important, growing area.

===Basic plastics===

Basic plastics (26% of sales) end up in everything from [[diaper]] liners to beverage [[bottle]]s and oil tanks.  Products are based on the three major polyolefins – polystyrene (such as Styron<sup>TM</sup> resins), polyethylene and polypropylene.

===Basic chemicals===

Basic chemicals (12% of sales) are used internally by Dow as raw materials, and are also sold worldwide.  Markets include dry cleaning, paints and coatings, snow and ice control and the food industry.  Major products include ethylene glycol, [[Sodium hydroxide|caustic soda]], [[chlorine]], [[vinyl chloride]] monomer (VCM, for making [[PVC]]) and [[calcium chloride]].  [[Ethylene oxide]] (EO) and [[propylene oxide]] and the derived alcohols [[ethylene glycol]] and [[propylene glycol]] are major [[feedstock]]s for the manufacture of plastics such as polyurethane and [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]].

===Hydrocarbons and energy===

The Hydrocarbons and Energy operating segment (13% of sales) oversees energy management at Dow, succeeding in raising energy efficiency by 92% since 1990.<ref>''Chemical and Engineering News'', Vol. 84, Issue 22 (May 29, 2006), pp 10-15</ref>  Fuels and oil-based raw materials are also procured.  Major feedstocks for Dow are provided by this group, including [[ethylene]], [[propylene]], [[1,3-butadiene]], [[benzene]] and [[styrene]].

== History ==
The company originally sold only [[bleach]] and [[potassium bromide]], achieving a daily bleach output of 72 tons a day in 1902. Early in the company's existence, a group of [[Economy of the United Kingdom|British]] manufacturers attempted to drive Dow out of business by cutting prices. Dow survived by cutting prices in response and, although losing about $90,000 in income, began to diversify its [[product line]].<ref>{{cite website | url=http://www.geo.msu.edu/geo333/dow.html | title=Dow Chemical | publisher=[[University of Michigan]] Department of Geography | accessed=June 24, 2006}}</ref> Even in its early history, the company set a tradition of rapidly diversifying its [[product line]].  Within twenty years, Dow had become a major producer of [[agricultural]] chemicals, elemental [[chlorine]], [[phenol]] and other [[dye]]stuffs, and [[magnesium]] metal.

In the 1930s, Dow began production of plastic resins, which would grow to become one of the corporation's major businesses.  Its first plastic products were [[ethylcellulose]], made in 1935, and [[polystyrene]], made in 1937.

In 1930, Dow built its first plant to produce [[magnesium]] extracted from [[seawater]] rather than underground brine.  Growth of this business made Dow a strategically important business during [[World War II]], as magnesium became important in fabricating lightweight parts for [[aircraft]].  Also during the war, Dow and [[Corning Glass Works|Corning]] began their joint venture, [[Dow Corning]], to produce [[silicone]]s for military and later civilian use. In 1942 Dow began its foreign expansion with the formation of Dow Chemical of Canada in [[Sarnia, Ontario]] to produce [[styrene]] for use in [[styrene-butadiene]] [[synthetic rubber]].

In the post-war era, Dow began expanding outside North America, founding its first overseas subsidiary in [[Economy of Japan|Japan]] in 1952, with several other nations following rapidly thereafter.  Based largely on its growing plastics business, it opened a consumer products division beginning with Saran wrap in 1953.  Based on its growing chemicals and plastics businesses, Dow's sales exceeded $1 billion in 1964, $2 billion in 1971, and $10 billion in 1980.

Today, Dow is the world's largest producer of plastics; with its 2001 acquisition of [[Union Carbide]], it has become a major player in the [[petrochemical]] industry as well.

On [[August 31]], [[2006]] Dow announced that it had plans to close facilities at three locations:<ref>{{cite website | url=http://news.dow.com/dow_news/corporate/2006/20060831g.htm | title=Dow Announces Plant Closures To Strengthen Competitive Position | publisher=The Dow Chemical Company | date=August 31, 2006 | accessed=September 13, 2006}}</ref>
*It will shut down all of its production in [[Sarnia, Ontario|Sarnia]], [[Ontario]] by the end of 2008.
*One plant (Dow terminology for a production unit) at its site in [[Porto Marghera (Venice)]], [[Italy]], which had been shut down for planned maintenance earlier that month, will not be restarted.
*Two plants at its major site in [[Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta|Fort Saskatchewan]], [[Alberta]] were to be shut down by the end of October 2006.

==Dow Corning==
{{main|Dow Corning}}

Equally owned by Dow and [[Corning, Inc.]] (formerly Corning Glass Works), Dow Corning was founded in 1943 by the two companies as a joint venture. The company's focus is [[silicon]]-based products and technology.<ref>{{cite website | url=http://www.dowcorning.com/content/about/default.asp | title=About Dow Corning | publisher=Dow Corning | accessed=June 25, 2006}}</ref> Dow Corning in turn owns 63% of the [[Hemlock, Michigan]]-based [[Hemlock Semiconductor Corporation]], which manufactures [[polycrystalline silicon]] for [[semiconductor]] chips.<ref>{{cite website | url=http://www.ourmidland.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=16832187&BRD=2289&PAG=461&dept_id=472542&rfi=6 | title=Governor visits HSC; expansion plans on schedule | author=Wade, Cheryl | date=June 24, 2006 | publisher=Midland Daily News | accessed=June 25, 2006}}</ref>

Dow Corning manufactured silicone [[breast implants]], which were the cause of controversy and legal liability in the 1980s and 1990s (''see [[Dow Chemical Company#Breast implants|below]]''.)

==Board of directors==
Current members of the [[board of directors]] of The Dow Chemical Company are [[Arnold Allemang]] (who is also a senior adviser to the company); chemistry professor [[Jacqueline Barton]]; former [[Boeing]] manager [[James A. Bell]]; [[Whirlpool Corporation]] chairman and CEO [[Jeff Fettig]]; former [[U.S. Secretary of Commerce]] [[Barbara Franklin]]; Dow chairman and CEO [[Andrew N. Liveris]]; Dow CFO [[Geoffery E. Merszei]]; former Dow Brazil finance director [[J. Pedro Reinhard]]; Illinois Tool Works Inc. vice chairman [[James Ringler]]; [[Duke Energy Corporation]] president [[Ruth Shaw]]; and  Claris Capital chairman [[Paul Stern]] (who is Dow's presiding director and a member of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]].)<ref>{{cite website | url=http://www.dow.com/corpgov/leader/stern.htm | title=Board of Directors | publisher=The Dow Chemical Company | accessed=June 23, 2006}}</ref>

=== Major Sponsorships===

In September 2004, the company obtained the naming rights to the Saginaw County Event Center in [[Saginaw, Michigan]]; the center is now called the [[Dow Event Center]]. The [[Saginaw Spirit]] (of the [[Ontario Hockey League]]) plays at the Center, which also hosts events such as [[professional wrestling]] and live theater.<ref>{{cite website | url=http://www.dow.com/facilities/namerica/michigan/outreach/eventcenter.htm | title=The Dow Event Center | publisher=The Dow Chemical Company | accessed=June 27, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite website | url = http://www.doweventcenter.com/ | title=Welcome to the Dow Event Center | publisher=Dow Event Center | accessed=June 27, 2006}}</ref>

In October 2006 the company bought the naming rights to the stadium used by the Single-A [[Minor League baseball]] team located in its hometown of Midland, Michigan. The stadium (which opens in April 2007) is called [[Dow Diamond]]. The Dow Foundation played a key role in bringing the team, the [[Great Lakes Loons]], to the city.

The company also sponsors a global running relay to highlight the need for better drinking water in locations around the globe. The run will roughly follow the 41st North parallel and cover nearly 12,000 miles. The run is organized by the Blue Planet Run Foundation.

==Outlook==
{{future}}
Dow CEO [[Andrew N. Liveris]] called 2005 the company's "best year ever" with operating profits of $5.4 billion, a jump of 56.5% compared with the previous year. <ref>"Top 50 Chemical Producers", ''Chemical and Engineering News'', Vol. 84, Issue 20 (May 15, 2006), pp 10-15</ref>  Net income rose more than 60% to $4.5 billion, on sales of $46.3 billion.  2006 looks as if it could be even better, with first-quarter net earnings of $1.2 billion. <ref name="liveris">''"Liveris Tells It Like It Is", Chemical and Engineering News'', Vol. 84, Issue 22 (May 29, 2006), pp 10-15</ref>  All this is occurring in the context of adverse operating conditions, caused by high energy & raw material costs, and the effects of two damaging hurricanes.

Liveris supports the vertically integrated approach used at Dow, which produces everything from basic chemical [[feedstock]]s to high value products such as pesticides and reverse osmosis membranes.  These value-adding product chains, along with Dow's wide product range, help the company to weather the storms of the global economy.  Despite this, high energy and feedstock costs may begin to take their toll, particularly if global demand begins to fall just as supply is rising.

Like many chemical companies, Dow is facing pressures of regulation in the US and [[Economy of the European Union|Europe]], particularly as the [[European Union|EU]] introduces its new [[Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals|REACH]] policy.  Litigation costs in the US taken over by Dow as a result of its 2001 takeover of [[Union Carbide]] also remain a concern.  

For these reasons the company is looking to the Middle East and Asia for new projects.  In [[Kuwait]] Dow is constructing (with [[Petrochemical Industries Company|PIC of Kuwait]]) a new world-scale [[petroleum cracking|ethane cracker]] for production of [[ethylene]], along with an [[ethylene oxide]]/[[ethylene glycol]] plant and (for 2008) a facility for production of [[aromatic hydrocarbon]]s.  In [[Oman]], the company is working with the Oman government to build a new world-scale [[polyethylene]] plant.  In China, the company is collaborating with [[Shenhua Group]] (the country's largest [[coal mining]] company) to improve [[catalyst]] efficiency to allow viable conversion of [[coal]] to [[alkene|olefin]]s.  Dow is also seeking to expand its [[Research and development|R&D]] presence in Asia, adding 600 jobs in [[Shanghai]] by the end of 2007, and the company may open up a large R&D center in India. 

The joint ventures planned for Asia are typical of Dow's "asset-light" approach, which works by offering a combination of intellectual property and money in exchange for a share in a world-scale production facility.  At the same time, the company is considering selling a share of some of its existing assets in order to free up cash.  

In June 2006 Liveris announced Dow's [[safety]] and [[environmentalism|environmental]] goals for [[2015]]: <ref name="liveris"/>
* 75% reduction in environmental, health and safety indicators from 2005. The company aims to have no fatalities, and a reduction in injuries, spillages and leaks.
* 25% increase in [[energy efficiency]].
* 2.5% annual reduction in [[greenhouse gas]] emissions intensity.
Liveris expects these goals to be reached predominantly with [[fossil fuel]]s, through [[energy conservation]] and reduction of [[energy intensity]], as he does not expect [[alternative energy]] to play a major role for at least 10-20 years.

==Environmental and human rights controversies==
===Union Carbide Bhopal disaster===
{{main article|Bhopal disaster}}

In 1984, a chemical factory operated by [[Union Carbide]], an American company, leaked lethal gases into the surrounding environment, which has caused more than 20,000 deaths and 100,000 disabilities. In 1999, Dow purchased Union Carbide, which is now a [[wholly owned subsidiary]]. Dow denies legal liability for the disaster, since it did not own or operate the Bhopal factory. <ref>{{cite website | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/3/newsid_2698000/2698709.stm | title=On This Day: December 3, 1984 | publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation | accessed=June 24, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite website | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/bhopal/4023447.stm | title=Response: Union Carbide and Dow Chemical  | date=November 25, 2004 | publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation}}</ref>

The human rights organization [[Amnesty International]] has held Dow responsible for the persistence of contamination and continued suffering of the victims of Bhopal disaster.<ref>{{cite website | url=http://web.amnesty.org/library/pdf/ASA200152004ENGLISH/$File/ASA2001504.pdf | title=Clouds of Injustice: Bhopal Disaster, 20 years on  | date=2004 | publisher=Amnesty Internationl}}</ref>
Victims of the Bhopal disaster and their supporters have demanded that Dow compel Union Carbide to face trial in India, where it is a fugitive from justice. <ref>[http://www.studentsforbhopal.org/Assets/CJM_Jan2005.pdf]</ref>

=== Breast implants ===

A major manufacturer of silicone [[breast implants]], Dow Corning was successfully sued in 1977 for damages arising from a woman whose implants ruptured; it was the first such successful suit, and Dow Corning paid $170,000 in a settlement. During the 1980s, [[Ralph Nader]]'s [[Public Citizen]] Health Research Group publicised its belief that the implants were cancer-causing; in December of 1990, an episode of ''Face to Face with [[Connie Chung]]'' addressed the dangers of silicone implants. More lawsuits, as well as [[Food and Drug Administration]] reviews, [[United States Congress|Congressional]] hearings, and scientific studies took place in the ensuing years; as of December 1991, 137 individual lawsuits were filed against Dow Corning, a figure that would rise to 3,558 in December 1992, and 19,092 by December 1994. Amidst the flurry of lawsuits in May 1995, Dow Corning filed for [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy protection; several judgments against Dow Corning and Dow Chemical were handed down in lawsuits.

=== Napalm ===

[[Image:TrangBang.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[June 8]], [[1972]]: [[Kim Phuc|Kim Phúc]], center, running down a road near [[Trang Bang]] after an [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] 'napalm' bomb attack. <small>([[Nick Ut]] / ©[[Associated Press]])</small>]]
During the [[Vietnam War]], Dow became the sole supplier of [[napalm]] to the [[United States military]]. Napalm, an [[incendiary]] liquid used as a weapon in Vietnam, led to human casualties that were widely displayed in the news media. Protests of Dow took place at many colleges but Dow's board of directors voted to continue production of napalm (after attempting to persuade the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] to accept responsibility for napalm and exculpate Dow's management). 

===Agent Orange===

[[Agent Orange]], a chemical [[defoliant]] containing [[dioxin]], was also manufactured by Dow for use by the U.S. military during the Vietnam War; the dioxin from the defoliant made its way into the [[food chain]] and was linked to a major increase in [[birth defects]] among Vietnamese people. In 2005, a lawsuit was filed by Vietnamese victims of Agent Orange against Dow and [[Monsanto Company]], which also supplied Agent Orange to the military. The companies argued that no link between Agent Orange and the alleged health problems had been proven, and furthermore that the companies are not responsible for the manner in which their products are used by the military.<ref>{{cite website | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4305287.stm | title= Agent Orange lawsuit opens in US | date=March 1, 2005 | publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] | accessed=June 27, 2006}}</ref> The lawsuit was thrown out.<ref>{{cite website | url=http://www.todayonline.com/articles/122591.asp | title = US won't compensate Vietnam's Agent Orange victims: official | date=June 6, 2006 | publisher=Todayonline.com | accessed=June 27, 2006}}</ref> In 2006, a court in [[South Korea]] did order Dow and Monsanto to compensate [[military of South Korea|South Korean veterans]] of the Vietnam War and their families for Agent Orange-related injuries.<ref>{{cite website | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11037756/from/RSS/ | title=Court rules against U.S. firms on Agent Orange | date=January 26, 2006 | publisher=[[MSNBC]] | accessed=June 27, 2006}}</ref>

=== Dioxins in Michigan ===
Starting in the early 2000s, residents living along the [[Tittabawassee River]] near the company's headquarters in Midland and nearby [[Saginaw County, Michigan|Saginaw]] counties in [[Michigan]] filed a class-action lawsuit against the company for [[dioxin]] contamination (levels of dioxins were found above those allowed by the Department of Environmental Quality) in the soil on the riverbed and along its shores.  As of June 2005, the case is still awaiting class certification. [http://www.commondreams.org/views05/0418-31.htm]

===Chlorpyrifos===
[[Chlorpyrifos]], marketed by Dow as [[Dursban]], is well known as a home and garden [[insecticide]], and until 2000 it was one of the most widely used household [[pesticide]] in the US.  The pesticide is also a nerve toxin and suspected [[endocrine disruptor]] and has been associated with [[carcinogenicity]], reproductive and developmental [[toxicity]], and [[acute toxicity]]. One study claims that Dow has contributed to 80% of the Chlorpyrifos burden of the US.

In 1995, Dow was fined $732,000 for not sending the EPA reports it had received on 249 Dursban poisoning incidents. In June 2000, Dow withdrew registration of chlorpyrifos for use in homes and other places where children could be exposed, and severely restricted its use on crops. The company, however, continues to market Dursban in industrializing countries, including India, where Dow's sales literature claimed Dursban has "an established record of safety regarding humans and pets."

In 2003, Dow agreed to pay $2 million - the largest penalty ever in a pesticide case - to the state of New York, in response to a lawsuit filed by the Attorney General to end Dow's illegal advertising of Dursban as "safe".
