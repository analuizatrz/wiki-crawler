'''Gemifloxacin mesylate''' (trade name '''Factive®''', [[Oscient Pharmaceuticals]]) is an oral [[broad-spectrum]] [[quinolone]] [[antibacterial]] agent used in the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic [[bronchitis]] and mild-to-moderate [[pneumonia]].

==Microbiology==

Gemifloxacin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms: 

:Aerobic [[gram-positive]] microorganisms - ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' including [[multi-drug resistant]] ''Streptococcus pneumoniae''  (MDRSP). MDRSP includes isolates previously known as PRSP (penicillin-resistant ''Streptococcus pneumoniae''), and are strains resistant to two or more of the following antibiotics: penicillin, 2nd generation [[cephalosporins]], e.g., [[cefuroxime]], [[macrolides]], [[tetracyclines]] and [[trimethoprim]]/[[sulfamethoxazole]].

:''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' ([[methicillin]]-susceptible strains only) and ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]''

:Aerobic [[gram-negative]] microorganisms - ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'', ''[[Haemophilus parainfluenzae]]'', [[Klebsiella pneumoniae]] (many strains are moderately susceptible), [[Moraxella catarrhalis]], ''[[Acinetobacter lwoffii]]'', ''[[Klebsiella oxytoca]]'', ''[[Legionella pneumophila]]'', ''[[Proteus vulgaris]]''.
:Other microorganisms - ''[[Chlamydia pneumoniae]]'', ''[[Mycoplasma pneumoniae]]''

Comparative [[minimum inhibitory concentration]]s (MICs) (μg/ml) of gemifloxacin versus commonly used [[fluoroquinolones]] against major [[pathogens]]:

Compared with currently available fluoroquinolones, gemifloxacin demonstrated improved [[in vitro]] activity (Gemifloxacin > [[Garenofloxacin]] > [[Moxifloxacin]] > [[Gatifloxacin]] as in following table) against ''S. pneumoniae'' (MIC for 90% eradication 0.03 µg/mL) and similar activity against gram-negative [[respiratory]] pathogens (''Haemophilus influenzae'', ''Moraxella catarrhalis'') and atypical pathogens such as ''Chlamydia pneumoniae'', ''Legionella pneumophila'', and ''Mycoplasma pneumoniae''.

It is reported that penicillin-resistant ''S. pneumoniae'' clinical isolates, also resistant to [[ciprofloxacin]] (MICs, 2 to 64 μg/ml), are highly susceptible to gemifloxacin (MICs, 0.03 to 0.12 μg/ml). It is also reported that other fluoroquinolones like [[levofloxacin]] and moxifloxacin (with AUC(0-24)/MIC = 4.4-7.4) provide little or no inhibition of ciprofloxacin-resistant strains, while gemifloxacin is the only fluoroquinolone (with AUC(0-24)/MIC ≥ 32) to eradicate all ciprofloxacin-resistant strains.

As it is obvious from the above, that gemifloxacin is the most potent fluoroquinolone against S. pneumoniae esp. against multidrug resistant-, ciprofloxacin-resistant, and even levofloxacin-resistant strains.

The [[pharmacokinetics]] of gemifloxacin are linear over the dose range from 40 mg to 640 mg, thus having predictable pharmacokinetics.

==Mechanism of action==

Gemifloxacin acts by inhibiting [[DNA synthesis]] through the inhibition of both [[DNA gyrase]] and [[topoisomerase IV]] (TOPO IV), which are essential for bacterial growth. ''S. pneumoniae'' showing [[mutations]] in both DNA gyrase and TOPO IV (double mutants) are resistant to most fluoroquinolones. 

Gemifloxacin is the only fluoroquinolone which has the ability to inhibit both [[enzyme]] systems (dual targeting of both DNA Gyrase & TOPO IV) at therapeutically relevant drug levels in ''S. pneumoniae'', and has MIC values that are still in the susceptible range for some of these double mutants.
Inhibitory activities of fluoroquinolones against ''S. pneumoniae'' DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV (TOPO IV)

[[IC50]] (µM)†
Fluoroquinolone	DNA Gyrase	DNA Topoisomerase IV
Gemifloxacin	5-10	          2.5-5
Moxifloxacin	20	          10
Gatifloxacin	20-40	          10-20
Levofloxacin	80	          40

(†Inhibitory concentration (IC50) is the concentration at which 50% of the activity of a target enzyme is inhibited. The lower the IC50, the greater the inhibitory effect)

Less risk of development of resistance
Compared to other fluoroquinolones, resistance to gemifloxacin is low as the resistance is via multistep mutations and efflux.  The frequency of spontaneous mutation is low (10<sup>-7</sup> to <10<sup>-10</sup>). Some microorganisms resistant to other fluoroquinolones may be susceptible to gemifloxacin.

==Indication and usage==

GEMIMAC is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the conditions listed below. Success has been achieved in the treatment of [[viral]] fever with Gemimac with good patient [[compliance]].
Acute bacterial exacerbation of [[chronic bronchitis]] caused by ''S. pneumoniae'', ''Haemophilus influenzae'', ''Haemophilus parainfluenzae'', or ''Moraxella catarrhalis''.
[[Community-acquired pneumonia]] (of mild to moderate severity) caused by ''S. pneumoniae'' (including multi-drug resistant strains, ''Haemophilus influenzae'', ''Moraxella catarrhalis'', ''Mycoplasma pneumoniae'', ''Chlamydia pneumoniae'', or ''Klebsiella pneumoniae''.
