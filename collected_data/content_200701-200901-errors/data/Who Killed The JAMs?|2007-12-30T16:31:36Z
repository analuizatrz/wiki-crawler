'''''Who Killed The JAMs?''''' is the second and final studio album by [[The KLF#Incarnations|The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu]] (The JAMs).  Similar in style to the preceding ''[[1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)]]'', the album is a fusion of [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[drum machine]]s and [[Sampling (music)|samples]] of a diversity of musical works, although in general the samples are more covertly integrated here than they are in ''1987''.

==Context==
Early in 1987, [[Bill Drummond]] and [[Jimmy Cauty]] formed The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu and released their debut single, "[[All You Need Is Love (The JAMs song)|All You Need Is Love]]". This was followed in June 1987 by their debut album, ''[[1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)]]'', an "energetic ... [and] loopy dance album"<ref>[[Ira Robbins|Robbins, I.]], [[Trouser Press]] ([http://trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=klf link]). Retrieved 19 April 2006.</ref> but with "too few ideas being spread too thin".<ref>Cranna, I. ''1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)'' review, ''[[Q Magazine]]'', July (?) 1987 ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=479 link]).</ref> In October 1987, The JAMs destroyed most remaining copies of the album following a copyright complaint from [[ABBA]] and the [[Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society]].<ref name=sweden87>[[James Brown (editor)|Brown, J.]], "Thank You For The Music", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', [[17 October]] [[1987]].</ref> The JAMs released several other singles that year and made regular appearances in the British [[music journalism|music press]].

In a December 1987 interview, Rockman Rock claimed that The JAMs' second album would be heavy metal... "We're gonna do heavy metal covers. We thought we'd do the whole of '[[Deep Purple in Rock|''Deep Purple In Rock'']]'." King Boy D continued: "Before we ever did the '1987' LP, we were gonna do one called 'The Justified Ancients Of Mu Mu In Rock' and do all [[Deep Purple]] songs. Then we got all these reviews treating us seriously so we thought maybe we should do a bit more of this stuff." <ref name="tune">Smith, M., "The Great TUNE Robbery", ''[[Melody Maker]]'', [[12 December]] [[1987]] ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=52 link])</ref> In actuality, the duo's second LP, ''Who Killed The JAMs?'', was "more of this stuff" - a fusion of [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[drum machine]]s and [[Sampling (music)|samples]] of a diversity of musical works, albeit with the samples generally more covertly integrated than on ''1987''. "It's like when you have a crap and you squeeze it out and think 'I'm never going to need another one'", they told ''Melody Maker'' when discussing plans for a second album, "Then half an hour later you're thinking that maybe you will".<ref>"Excerpts from Amply Sam(ply) Fox's 'Touch Me'", ''[[Melody Maker]]'', [[4 July]] [[1987]]</ref>

The same picture was used on the American compilation CD ''[[The History of The JAMs a.k.a. The Timelords]]''.]]
Released in February 1988, the sleeve of ''Who Killed The JAMs?'' pictured Drummond and Cauty with Cauty's [[Ford Galaxie]], later to become credited as the 'writer' of "[[Doctorin' the Tardis]]". In the foreground - and in a close-up shot on the reverse of the sleeve - was a bonfire of unsold copies of ''1987 (What The Fuck Is Going On?)'', which The JAMs had been ordered to destroy following their copyright dispute with ABBA.  The fire is referenced in the song "Burn The Bastards", and The JAMs' career story to date told in the song "Prestwich Prophet's Grin".

Upon release, the album was interpreted by sections of the music press to be The JAMs' last album,<ref name="a">''Who Killed The JAMs?'' Review (February 1988), ''[[Melody Maker]]''.</ref> and, excepting the compilation ''[[Shag Times]]'', it was. Most subsequent releases by Drummond and Cauty would be under their new moniker, [[The KLF]]. Drummond: "After all the notoriety we seemed to get on the rock papers news pages over the last year (something we began to feel more and more uncomfortable with) we are going to attempt to keep a low profile in 1988....<!-- Other than "Who Killed The JAMs?" and "Burn The Beat" ... there wont be anything new out by The JAMs this year.... W--> [although] we might put out a couple of 12" records under the name The K.L.F.<!--, these will be rap free just pure dance music, so don't expect to see them reviewed in the music papers-->.... As far as sampling is concerned, I'm sure we will continue doing it and from time to time get into trouble because of it, but it has always been only a part of the process of how we put our records together and not the reason for them existing. We will carry on doing what we want to do, when we want to do it, our motivation, everything we see and hear."<ref name="info88">Drummond, B., KLF Communications Info Sheet, [[22 January]] [[1988]] ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=501 link]).</ref>

==Reviews==
''[[Melody Maker]]'' declared ''Who Killed The JAMs'' to be "divine [[nihilism]]", "an outward show of self-deception, irrationality and bankruptcy that worries and rejoices itself to death".<ref name="a"/>
''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' thought the album "a masterpiece of pathos", referring to "hopeless bravado in the face of massed corporate opposition", and awarded the maximum five stars.<ref>"The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu: ''Who Killed The JAMs?''" , ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds Magazine]]'', [[13 February]] [[1988]].</ref>

==Track listing<ref name="info">[[Bill Drummond|Drummond, B.]], "Info Sheet One", [[KLF Communications]] newsletter, 10 March 1988 ([http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=502 link]). The tracklisting was not actually printed on the album sleeve because, according to Drummond, " to get the record out as fast as possible after we had finished recording
 it, we had to deliver the art work to the printers before Christmas at which
 time we didn't know what the tracks were to be called."</ref>==
