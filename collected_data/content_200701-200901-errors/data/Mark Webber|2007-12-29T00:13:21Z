'''Mark Alan Webber''', (born [[August 27]], [[1976]]) is an [[Australia]]n [[Formula One]] driver. He was born in [[Queanbeyan, New South Wales|Queanbeyan]], [[New South Wales]], son of Alan, the local [[motorcycle]] dealer. He is the first Australian to race in Formula One since [[David Brabham]] in 1994.

After some racing success in Australia, Webber moved to the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in 1995 to further his motorsports career. He continued to win, although he gained his biggest headlines while driving for the [[Mercedes-Benz]] sports car squad at [[24 hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]] in 1999 where he had two spectacular accidents during practice and warmup in which an aerodynamic fault caused the car to somersault off the Mulsanne straight. After Mercedes' withdrawal from the race, Webber began a partnership with fellow Australian [[Paul Stoddart]], at that time owner of the European racing [[Formula 3000]] team, which eventually took them both into Formula One when Stoddart bought the [[Minardi]] team.

Webber made his debut in Formula One in 2002, scoring Minardi's first points in three years at his and Stoddart's home race. After an impressive first season, [[Jaguar Racing]] took him on as lead driver. During two years with the generally uncompetitive team Webber several times qualified on the front two rows of the grid and outperformed his team mates. He joined the former championship winning [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] team in 2005, for whom he achieved his best finish in Formula One to date; a third place at the [[2005 Monaco Grand Prix]]. He has since equalled his third placing at the [[2007 European Grand Prix]].

Webber is a keen sportsman away from the track. He has won the annual F1 Pro-Am [[tennis]] tournament in [[Barcelona]] three times and has recently set up the 'Mark Webber Pure Tasmania Challenge' trek across [[Tasmania]] to raise funds for cancer charities.

==Early career==
Mark Webber was born in [[Queanbeyan, New South Wales|Queanbeyan]], [[New South Wales]], son of Alan, the local [[motorcycle]] dealer. He started his relationship with sport young, working as a ball-boy for premiership winning [[rugby league]] team the [[Canberra Raiders]] during the late 1980s. However, [[motorsport]] was where his interest lay, later listing Formula One [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|World Champion]] [[Alain Prost]] and [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing|Grand Prix motorcycle]] racer [[Kevin Schwantz]] as his childhood heroes. Starting out racing motorcycles, Webber moved to four wheels in [[1991]], taking up [[kart racing|karting]] at the relatively late age of 15. He won the New South Wales state championship in [[1993]], and moved straight into the Australian [[Formula Ford]] Championship after his father bought him an ex-[[Craig Lowndes]] [[Van Diemen]] FF1600. Working as a driving instructor at [[Sydney]]'s [[Oran Park Raceway]] between races, Webber finished 14th overall in his debut season. Continuing in the series in [[1995]], Webber scored several victories, including a win in the support race for the [[1995 Australian Grand Prix|Australian Grand Prix]] at [[Adelaide Street Circuit|Adelaide]]. He finished the series in fourth place, but perhaps more importantly, teamed up with Championship co-ordinator Ann Neal, who secured him a seven-year sponsorship with Australian [[Yellow Pages]], and would become his manager and accompany him on a trip to [[England]] in an attempt to start a career in [[Europe]].

Webber was given a test at [[Snetterton Motor Racing Circuit|Snetterton]] with the Van Diemen team, and subsequently earned a works drive for the team at the 1995 Formula Ford Festival, held at [[Brands Hatch]]. He finished third in his first international race, a result good enough to see him retained by the team for the [[1996]] Championship. Before moving to Europe permanently, Webber won the [[Formula Holden]] race at the [[1996 Australian Grand Prix]] in [[Melbourne Grand Prix Circuit|Melbourne]]. During the 1996 British Formula Ford Championship, Webber took four victories on his way to second place overall, finishing his season strongly with a win in the Formula Ford Festival. He also won the [[Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps|Spa-Francorchamps]] race of the Formula Ford Euro Cup, taking third in the series despite competing in only two of the three rounds. His results throughout the year saw him voted as Australian motorsport's "Young Achiever" and "International Achiever" of 1996. Two days after his Festival victory, Webber completed a successful test for [[Alan Docking Racing]], and was signed by the team to graduate to [[Formula Three]] in [[1997]].

Without the financial backing he had enjoyed during his time in Formula Ford, Webber and his team struggled to find the money to fund their championship campaign. He was almost forced to quit halfway through the season, but was able to obtain personal support from Australian [[rugby union]] legend [[David Campese]], which helped him to complete the year. Webber took victory in just his fourth ever F3 race, at Brands Hatch, leading from start to finish and setting a new lap record in the process. He took a further four podium finishes, including a second place in the support race for the [[1997 British Grand Prix]], and finished the season in fourth overall. Webber also took strong finishes in the [[Marlboro Masters]] at [[Circuit Zandvoort|Zandvoort]] (3rd) and the [[F3 Macao Grand Prix]] (4th), both times making his circuit debut. During the 1997 season, Webber was approached by [[Mercedes-AMG]] to participate in a [[sports car racing|sports car]] race. He initially declined the offer, but at the end of the year he was invited to participate in a test session for the team at [[Österreichring|A1-Ring]] in [[Austria]]. AMG were suitably impressed with Webber, and he was signed as the official Mercedes works junior driver for the [[1998]] [[FIA GT Championship]], alongside reigning champion [[Bernd Schneider (racecar driver)|Bernd Schneider]]. Travelling around the world, including the [[United States]], [[Japan]] and Europe, the pair won five of the ten rounds on their way to second in the overall standings, remarkably beaten to the Championship by teammates [[Klaus Ludwig]] and [[Ricardo Zonta]] by just 8 seconds in the final race at [[Laguna Seca]].

Webber remained with the AMG team for [[1999]], and was promoted to his own race car for the season. However, his sportscar career came to an early end after he flipped twice on the straight in the lead up to the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] race that year. An aerodynamic fault on the team's [[Mercedes-Benz CLR]]s caused Webber to spectacularly become airborne during both practice and race-day warm up, with the same fate befalling teammate [[Peter Dumbreck]] five hours into the race. Both drivers escaped uninjured, but the crashes forced Mercedes to shelve their sportscar program for the year and Webber to reconsider a return to [[open wheel car|open wheel]] racing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.speedtv.com/articles/auto/roadracing/22413/ |title=SPEED Top 10 Moments #4: Mercedes Le Mans Flip |author=Tom Jensen |date=[[2006-03-07]] |accessdate=2006-06-12}}</ref> Webber spoke to Formula One team owner [[Eddie Jordan]], who introduced him to fellow Australian [[Paul Stoddart]]. Stoddart offered to undercut the necessary $1.1 million budget for Webber, and gave him a drive in his Eurobet Arrows [[Formula 3000]] team for [[2000]]. As a result, Webber also got his first taste of a [[Formula One cars|Formula One car]], completing a two-day test at [[Circuit de Catalunya|Barcelona]] in December 1999 for the [[Arrows]] F1 team. 

Webber was signed as test driver for the Arrows F1 team for 2000, and also gained sponsorship from Australian [[beer]] company [[Foster's Lager|Foster's]] whilst competing in the F3000 Championship.<ref>{{cite web | title=Foster's and Mark Webber: Two Great Aussies |url=http://www.fosters.com.au/mediacentre/686EE761401149D7941C83832EA89874.htm| accessdate=February 6 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Webber took victory in round two of the season at [[Silverstone Circuit]], and finished the series with two fastest laps and three podiums on his way to third overall - the highest position of any rookie that year.<ref>{{cite web | title=Mark Webber | work=The Formula One DataBase | url=http://www.f1db.com/f1/page/Mark_Webber | accessdate=February 7 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Contract issues meant that Webber was never able to drive the Arrows A21 car, and rejected an offer of a full contract for 2001 in July. However, he was offered a three day evaluation test for [[Benetton Formula|Benetton]] at the end of the year, outpacing F1 drivers [[Ralf Schumacher]] and [[Giancarlo Fisichella]] at [[Autódromo do Estoril|Estoril]]. The results were good enough to earn him the test driver role with the team for 2001, and he also agreed to take on team boss [[Flavio Briatore]] as manager in return for finance for a further F3000 season. Webber joined the championship-winning [[Super Nova Racing]] team, and despite winning at [[Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari|Imola]], [[Circuit de Monaco|Monaco]] and [[Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours|Magny-Cours]], he finished second overall to British driver [[Justin Wilson]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Formula 3000 International FIA Championships 2001 | url=http://www.clarinet.fi/~spitkane/F3000/raceresults01.htm | accessdate=February 7|accessyear=2006}}</ref> Webber was replaced as test driver for Benetton for 2002 by [[Fernando Alonso]], but Briatore managed to secure Webber a contract to race alongside [[Alex Yoong]] in the Stoddart-owned [[Minardi]] team, making him the first Australian in Formula One since [[David Brabham]] in 1994.

===[[2002 Formula One season|2002]]===
[[Image:Webber 2002.jpg|thumb|Webber driving for [[Minardi]] at the [[2002 French Grand Prix|2002 French GP]].]]
Webber made his Formula One debut at his home race, the [[2002 Australian Grand Prix]].

===[[2003 Formula One season|2003]]===
Webber's Jaguar career started disappointingly, as he qualified in 14th place for the [[2003 Australian Grand Prix]] before being forced to retire on lap 15 with a rear [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] failure. The following race in [[2003 Malaysian Grand Prix|Malaysia]] was even more dramatic for Webber, as [[Giancarlo Fisichella]] began reversing towards him on the starting grid, before Webber's in-car [[fire extinguisher]] discharged into his face and he was eventually forced to retire from 8th with an oil consumption problem.<ref>{{cite web|title=An eventful time for Webber in Malaysia|url=http://www.markwebber.com/news/details.cfm?ObjectID=741&ReturnString=%3FViewBy=Round&view_by_round=Year_2003|accessdate=February 10|accessyear=2006}}</ref> Webber took a remarkable provisional pole position in Friday qualifying of the [[2003 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazilian Grand Prix]], outqualifying local driver [[Rubens Barrichello]] by 0.138 seconds in a [[rain]]-affected session.<ref>{{cite web|title=2003 Brazilian Grand Prix &ndash; Friday qualifying|url=http://www.formula1.com/results/season/2003/4/27/|accessdate=February 10|accessyear=2006}}</ref> He continued his good performance in the Saturday session, taking a career-best 3rd on the grid, a result which was also Jaguar Racing's best qualifying performance in their four-year Formula 1 history.<ref>{{cite web|title=Webber to start Brazilian Grand Prix in third position|url=http://www.markwebber.com/news/details.cfm?ObjectID=801&ReturnString=%3FViewBy%3DMonth%26view%5Fby%5Fmonth%3D4%2D2003|accessdate=February 10|accessyear=2006}}</ref> In the race, which was hit heavily by rain, Webber was sitting in seventh place when he attempted to cool his [[tire|tyres]] by driving through a [[puddle]] lying off-line in the final corner.<ref>Clarkson, Tom "On the inside" ''F1 Racing (Australian edition)'' May 2003: p. 23</ref> The resultant lack of [[friction|grip]] caused Webber to crash heavily into the pit straight tyre barriers, leaving debris on the track which caused a second major crash.

[[Image:Mark Webber 2003 helmet.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Webber's 2003 helmet design]] At the [[2003 British Grand Prix|British Grand Prix]], on the 11th lap, as the procession of cars exited the Becketts corner onto the Hangar straight, now-defrocked priest [[Neil Horan]] cleared the fence wearing a kilt, waving banners with statements "Read the bible" and "The Bible is always right"<ref name=NewSeekers>{{cite news |first = |last = |title = The new seekers|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3242953.stm |format =  |publisher = BBC Sports |date =  November 5, 2003 |accessmonthday=26 August | accessyear=2006|language = English}}</ref> and ran towards the sequence of cars, forcing several cars to swerve to avoid him. Webber came closest to hitting Horan, in a terrifying parallel to the accident at the 1977 South African Grand Prix in which driver [[Tom Pryce]] was killed after hitting a track worker. The safety car was deployed to remove Horan from the track, and Webber evenutally finished 14th. 

Post Silverstone, Webber had scored 12 Championship points compared to Pizzonia's 0, and after much speculation it was announced that Minardi driver Justin Wilson would replace the Brazilian for the remainder of the year. The [[2003 German Grand Prix|German Grand Prix]] saw Webber's sixth retirement for the season, after he made a desperate last lap lunge on [[Jenson Button]] in an attempt to salvage a point from the weekend.<ref>{{cite web|title=Do or die effort ends Webber's race on final lap|url=http://www.markwebber.com/news/details.cfm?ObjectID=1581&ReturnString=%3FViewBy%3DMonth%26view%5Fby%5Fmonth%3D8%2D2003|accessdate=February 10|accessyear=2006}}</ref> Consecutive points finishes in [[2003 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]] and [[2003 Italian Grand Prix|Italy]] saw Webber climb to ninth in the drivers' standings, with a 5 point margin to Button. He was unable to hold onto his position however, as one too many laps on dry tyres saw him spin out from the lead of the [[2003 United States Grand Prix|United States Grand Prix]], and a disappointing 11th-place result in the [[2003 Japanese Grand Prix|Japanese Grand Prix]] meant he finished on equal points with Button, but lost out on a countback.<ref>{{cite web|year=2003|title=2003 FIA Formula One World Championship &ndash; Drivers' and Constructors' Final Standings|url=http://www.fia.com/resources/documents/111698164__F1_Classification_2003.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=February 10|accessyear=2006}}</ref> Although Wilson scored a point in the United States Grand Prix, Webber had still never been outqualified by a teammate, and late in the year, Jaguar announced that rookie [[Christian Klien]] would team up with Webber for the [[2004 Formula One season|2004 season]].

===[[2004 Formula One season|2004]]===
Continuing with Jaguar in 2004, Webber qualified sixth fastest for the first race of the season, the [[2004 Australian Grand Prix|Australian Grand Prix]], but faced his second consecutive retirement from his home race, this time due to a [[gearbox]] failure. The following race, the [[2004 Malaysian Grand Prix|Malaysian Grand Prix]], Webber produced the best qualifying performance of his career, splitting the dominant Ferraris to line up 2nd on the grid. The race was disappointing though, a stall at the start meaning he was well outside the top 10 by the time the cars reached turn 1. An aggressive lap saw him move up to ninth place, but during an exciting battle with [[Ralf Schumacher]], the German collided with him and forced Webber to pit with damage to his front wing and tyre. In his desperation to make up for the lost time, Webber exceeded the pitlane speed limit and was handed a drive-through penalty, which left him even further behind. More frustration eventually led to the end of his race, as he spun into the gravel trap on the outside of the final corner on lap 23. The situation improved for the following race in [[2004 Bahrain Grand Prix|Bahrain]] though, as Webber picked up his first point for the season despite a small mistake in qualifying which left him in 14th and marked the first time he had been outqualified by his teammate in F1.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mistake ends Webber's strong qualifying run|url=http://www.markwebber.com/news/details.cfm?ObjectID=1614&ReturnString=%3FViewBy%3DMonth%26view%5Fby%5Fmonth%3D4%2D2004|accessdate=February 11|accessyear=2006}}</ref> He was unable to continue his pointscoring form, however, as intermittent electrical problems in [[2004 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino]] and a lack of grip in [[2004 Spanish Grand Prix|Spain]] meant that he could do no better than 13th and 12th in those races. 

Amid Jaguar's announcements of special one-race sponsorship deals with movie ''[[Ocean's Twelve]]'' and [[diamond]] company [[Steinmetz Group]], Webber suffered two engine failures in practice for the [[2004 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco Grand Prix]], the first of which forced Webber to extinguish it himself after being unable to find a trackside marshall willing to help.<ref>Webber, Mark "The Grand Prix Diary" ''F1 Racing (Australian edition)'' July 2004: p. 12</ref> In the race itself, Webber was forced to retire due to a loss of engine power, but he was able to pick up two Championship points in the following race with a seventh place finish in the [[2004 European Grand Prix|European Grand Prix]].

It was at this stage that former teammate Pizzonia returned to racing as a replacement for the injured Ralf Schumacher, and upon his return he accused Jaguar of favouritism towards Webber during their time as teammates, saying that Webber received new car parts one or two races before Pizzonia.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pizzonia hits out at "inhuman" Jaguar|url=http://www.pitpass.com/fes_php/pitpass_news_item.php?fes_art_id=21773|accessdate=February 11|accessyear=2006}}</ref> The claims were categorically denied by Jaguar boss [[David Pitchforth]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Pitchforth dismisses Pizzonia's claims|url=http://www.pitpass.com/fes_php/pitpass_news_item.php?fes_art_id=21774|accessdate=February 11|accessyear=2006}}</ref> and whilst Webber did not publicly comment on the situation at the time, he picked up his best finish of the season by finishing sixth in the [[2004 German Grand Prix|German Grand Prix]], running ahead of Pizzonia for the entire race.<ref>{{cite web|year=2004|title=2004 Grand Prix of Germany &ndash; Lap Chart|url=http://www.fia.com/sport/Championships/F1/F1_Lap_Charts/Germany/2004.html|publisher=[[FIA]]|accessdate=February 11|accessyear=2006}}</ref> Meanwhile, reports emerged that Jaguar could not guarantee that they would compete in Formula One for the [[2005 Formula One season|2005 season]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Will Jaguar be on the grid in 2005?|url=http://www.pitpass.com/fes_php/pitpass_news_item.php?fes_art_id=21463|accessdate=February 11|accessyear=2006}}</ref> and on [[July 28]] it was announced that Webber would drive for [[WilliamsF1]] for 2005 and beyond, later admitting this was the team that his "heart was always set on" throughout negotiations.<ref>Webber, Mark "The Grand Prix Diary" ''F1 Racing (Australian edition)'' September 2004: p. 12</ref> Webber was unable to build on his points tally, however as a 10th place in [[2004 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]], followed by a first-lap accident in [[2004 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgium]], 9th in [[2004 Italian Grand Prix|Italy]] and 10th in [[2004 Chinese Grand Prix|China]] saw him sitting 13th in the Championship. The penultimate race of the season in [[2004 Japanese Grand Prix|Japan]] saw Webber produce another good qualifying effort as he set the third fastest time, but his race ended prematurely as he suffered from a badly overheating cockpit, the cause of which could not be determined by Jaguar.<ref>{{cite web|title=Webber makes hot exit from Japanese Grand Prix|url=http://www.markwebber.com/news/details.cfm?ObjectID=1677&ReturnString=%3FViewBy%3DMonth%26view%5Fby%5Fmonth%3D10%2D2004|accessdate=February 11|accessyear=2006}}</ref> The [[2004 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazilian Grand Prix]] marked Webber's last race for Jaguar, and Jaguar's last in Formula One, but it ended sadly for the team, as Klien turned in on and collided with Webber as the Australian attempted to make up for a pit stop delay earlier in the race. Webber was forced to retire due to the damage and watched the remainder of the race from the grass on the outside of turn 1 as Klien finished 14th. 

Webber was granted an early release from his Jaguar contract to be allowed to test with his new team Williams over the winter. Williams had announced earlier that [[Jenson Button]] would drive for the team in 2005 alongside Webber, but after claims the [[Great Britain|Brit]] was still contracted to [[British American Racing|BAR]], his contract with Williams was overturned. With his new teammate undecided, and apparently going down to a "shootout" between [[Nick Heidfeld]] and Pizzonia, Webber hit back at Pizzonia's claims of unfair treatment during 2003, claiming the Brazilian was lying and saying he was a "loser" for believing that there was favouritism towards Webber,<ref>{{cite web|title=Webber re-ignites Pizzonia fight|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/4066115.stm|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=February 11|accessyear=2006}}</ref> comments which led to a reprimand from his new team.<ref>{{cite web|title=Webber carpeted by Williams|url=http://www.itv-f1.com/News_Article.aspx?PO_ID=31695|accessdate=February 11|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

His best chance to do so though came in the following race in [[2005 Malaysian Grand Prix|Malaysia]]. After qualifying fourth, Webber was running behind the Renault of Giancarlo Fisichella, who was struggling due to a lack of downforce and tyre grip. As Webber closed in and attempted a pass around the outside of turn 15, Fisichella locked up his brakes and slid into the side of Webber's car, eliminating both drivers from the race. Fisichella was later reprimanded by race stewards because of the incident,<ref>Hamilton, Maurice. "#2: Race shorts" ''F1 Racing (Australian edition)'' May 2005: p. 102</ref> but as Heidfeld took third in place of Webber, the weekend came to epitomise Webber's growing reputation as a fast qualifier who did not perform well under pressure in race situations.<ref>"Half-term Report" ''F1 Racing (Australian edition)'' August 2005: p40</ref> It was later revealed that Webber had competed in the first two races carrying a fractured [[rib]], an injury he had sustained during pre-season testing at [[Circuit de Catalunya|Barcelona]], though he "didn't want to make a fuss" about it and would be fully fit in time for the [[2005 Bahrain Grand Prix|Bahrain Grand Prix]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Baldwin, Alan|year=March 29, 2005| title=Webber raced with fractured rib| url=http://in.rediff.com/sports/2005/mar/29web.htm| accessdate=April 15|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

He followed this up by qualifying fourth and finishing a disappointing 10th after twice running wide off the track in the [[2005 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino Grand Prix]], although his position was revised to 7th after the disqualification of the [[British American Racing|BAR]] team and a penalty to Ralf Schumacher. The race was a poor one for Williams (Heidfeld was 9th before the reclassification), but Webber hit back at the [[2005 Spanish Grand Prix|Spanish Grand Prix]], qualifying 2nd and finishing 6th &ndash; his fourth pointscoring finish in the first five races. The following race in [[2005 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]] saw Webber take the first podium finish of his career, with third. On the rostrum however, Webber looked noticeably disappointed with the result after losing second to teammate Heidfeld due to the Williams team pitting Heidfeld before Webber, which caused Webber to lose time behind the slow Alonso. Webber had run ahead of Heidfeld all race long and would have been second had the team pitted them in regular sequence.<ref>{{cite web| year=May 23, 2005| title=Third place not good enough for Webber| url=http://www.abc.net.au/sport/content/200505/s1374347.htm| work=ABC Sport| accessdate=April 15| accessyear=2006}}</ref> The best result of Webber's career was followed by one of his worst at the [[2005 European Grand Prix|European Grand Prix]].

"European Grand Prix &ndash; Race Report" ''F1 Racing (Australian edition)'' July 2005: p. 99</ref> The following race in [[2005 Canadian Grand Prix|Canada]] was affected by this result, as Webber was only able to qualify 14th, but he was pleased with an eventual 5th-place finish and a further 4 Championship points.<ref>{{cite web| year=June 13, 2005| title=Four valuable points| url=http://www.markwebber.com/news/details.cfm?ObjectID=1742&ReturnString=%3FViewBy%3DMonth%26view%5Fby%5Fmonth%3D6%2D2005| accessdate=April 15|accessyear=2006}}</ref> The [[2005 United States Grand Prix|United States Grand Prix]] (where only 6 cars took part) was the beginning of a lean streak for Webber, with just one pointscoring finish in the next seven races, a seventh in [[2005 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]], but by this stage he had slipped from 6th to 10th in the World Championship. Webber had another poor race in [[2005 Turkish Grand Prix|Turkey]], where he collided with Michael Schumacher, causing extensive damage to both cars.

With Heidfeld injured, Webber's former Jaguar teammate Antônio Pizzonia stepped into the second Williams seat, with added pressure on Webber to perform well given the public argument the pair had towards the end of 2004. The [[2005 Italian Grand Prix|Italian Grand Prix]] saw Pizzonia gain the upper hand, driving to seventh whilst Webber was caught up in a first-corner incident which saw him finish 14th.<ref>{{cite web| year=September 4, 2005| title=Pizzonia shines as Williams super sub| url=http://www.formula1.com/race/news/3536/746.html| work=Formula 1.com| accessdate=April 15| accessyear=2006}}</ref> The roles were reversed for the following race in [[2005 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgium]], as Webber raced to fourth but Pizzonia retired after a collision with Juan Pablo Montoya in the closing laps.

For the first time in Webber's career, the first race of the season was not held in [[Melbourne Grand Prix Circuit|Melbourne]], and instead was in [[2006 Bahrain Grand Prix|Bahrain]]. Webber qualified 7th and had a solid race to finish 6th and pick up 3 Championship points. Although Webber was considered by some to have the better race performance,<ref>{{cite web|year=March 14, 2006|url=http://www.planet-f1.com/News/Story_Page/0,15909,3210_3265_1085668,00.html| title=The Battles of 2006: Bahrain| work=Planet-F1.com| accessdate=April 20| accessyear=2006}}</ref> this was generally overlooked for the fact that Rosberg set the fastest lap in his debut race and moved through the field well after a first-lap incident.<ref>{{cite web| year=March 12, 2006| url=http://www.planet-f1.com/News/Story_Page/0,15909,3210_3265_1081922,00.html| title=Bahrain GP Winners + Losers| work=Planet-F1.com| accessdate=April 20| accessyear=2006}}</ref> The following two races, in [[2006 Malaysian Grand Prix|Malaysia]] and [[2006 Australian Grand Prix|Australia]] were cut short due to mechanical problems. In Malaysia, Webber started 4th on the grid and was still running in that position before a [[hydraulics]] failure ended his race on lap 14. In his home race, Webber qualified seventh and was leading the race (before his first [[pit stop]]) when his [[transmission (mechanics)|gearbox]] failed on lap 22.<ref>{{cite web| year=April 2, 2006| title=Webber leads home race before retiring with gearbox problem| url=http://www.markwebber.com/news/details.cfm?ObjectID=1829&ReturnString=%3FViewBy%3DRound%26view%5Fby%5Fround%3DId%5F116| accessdate=April 20| accessyear=2006}}</ref> A sixth-place finish in [[2006 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino]] saw Webber move up to 9th in the Championship, but in the [[2006 European Grand Prix|European Grand Prix]] hydraulics failure struck again to end his race after he had fought up to 12th from 19th on the grid (due to a mid-weekend engine change).

The [[2006 Spanish Grand Prix|Spanish Grand Prix]] marked the first time Webber failed to make the top-10 cutoff in the new qualifying system, and he struggled during the race to eventually finish ninth. [[2006 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]], however, saw a huge improvement, with Webber qualifying on the front row (after [[Michael Schumacher]]'s grid penalty) and holding third for a large part of the race before retiring after his exhaust burned a wiring loom. The pace Webber showed displayed his talent when he has a good enough car, as aerodynamic efficiency is not as important at Monaco, and Webber's car was not as disadvantaged as at most other venues.<ref>{{cite web|year=May 28, 2006| title=Fiery End to Webber's Monaco Grand Prix| url=http://www.markwebber.com/news/details.cfm?ObjectID=1851&returnstring=%3FViewBy%3DRound%26view%5Fby%5Fround%3DId%5F120| accessdate=May 30| accessyear=2006}}</ref> In the [[2006 British Grand Prix]] Webber crashed out on the first lap after an incident with Ralf Schumacher and Scott Speed. In France, Webber suffered a spectacular tyre blowout at maximum speed. He gathered it up & parked it in the garage. Germany was one of Webber's strongest races of the year. He was on target for a podium until Mechanical failure stopped him in his tracks with only 9 laps to go. The Hungarian Grand Prix was another retirement for Webber, as he slid into a barrier in the wet conditions and crushed his front wing under the chassis of the Williams.

==={{F1|2007}}===
{{Cleanup|date=June 2007}}
Webber's two-year contract with Williams finished at the end of [[2006 Formula One season|2006]]. The team, however, held an option on his services for 2007 which they choose not to take up on its original terms. Although Webber had expressed his desire to stay with the team, Williams offered Webber a considerably smaller salary than had been stipulated in the original contract for the option year. Under advice from his manager, Flavio Briatore, Webber then sought another drive. Williams quickly elected to promote current test driver [[Alexander Wurz]] to a race seat.<ref>{{cite web| year=August 3, 2006| title=Wurz Land 2007 Race Seat| work=f1.com| url=http://www.formula1.com/news/4746.html| accessdate=August 3| accessyear=2006}}</ref> Williams team boss [[Sir Frank Williams]] stated that he was reluctant to wait for Webber to commit to the team once the option for future years had expired, though he did not blame Webber for waiting to see if there was a seat available at another team.

[[Image:Mark Webber 2007 Britain.jpg|thumb|right|Webber driving for RBR at the [[2007 British Grand Prix]], with a special ''Wings for Life'' livery.]]

After some speculation of Webber joining the [[Renault F1|Renault]] team, which is run by his manager [[Flavio Briatore]], it was announced on [[August 7]] [[2006]], that Webber would join [[Red Bull Racing]] for [[2007 Formula One season|2007]] to partner [[David Coulthard]], replacing former [[Jaguar Racing]] team mate [[Christian Klien]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/5253794.stm|title=news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/5253794.stm<!--INSERT TITLE-->|accessdate=2007-05-15}}</ref>
It is rumored that [[Flavio Briatore]] arranged an agreement with Red Bull that they will offer Webber a racing seat if Renault supplied the engines.
On [[January 26]], 2007 the new Red Bull RB3 challenger was unveiled in Spain, a car that has Mark Webber's hopes pinned upon it. Mark drove the car in a shakedown successfully at the Barcelona circuit on the same day.
The car features heavy revisions to the team's previous cars, and looks very much like [[Adrian Newey]]'s (RB3 designer) previous cars which have either won or come close to the World Title.
The car is fitted with a Renault RS27 engine.

In the first race of the 2007 season, in Melbourne, Webber qualified an impressive 7th place and held that position for the early part of the race, managing to finish in 13th position after the RB3 suffered from a throttle-related malfunction and a jammed fuel flap.

In the Malaysian Grand Prix, he again out qualified experienced team mate David Coulthard, and finished tenth, encouraging for such a new and radical car for the team. [[2007 Bahrain Grand Prix|Bahrain]] was also going well for both drivers, running sixth and seventh, until both cars retired due to mechanical malfunctions. Webber again was hampered by the aforementioned jammed fuel flap, radically affecting the aerodynamic drag, which is a vital set-up point for the [[Sakhir]] circuit.

The potential of both the car and Webber, who has certainly worked well this year to out-qualify his vastly more experienced team-mate, is high lighted by the closeness they are running to engine suppliers [[Renault F1|Renault]], although the [[Adrian Newey|Newey]]-designed car has had flaws which have inadvertently lead to Webber's scoreless season thus-far.

Though pace of the car seems to be picking up, with Coulthard qualifying in the top-10 for the [[2007 Spanish Grand Prix|Spanish Grand Prix]], Webber was unable to convert his early weekend pace into a competitive grid position due to hydraulic problems. His race was much the same, with a similar hydraulic problem retiring him early in the race whilst team-mate Coulthard notched up the team's first points with a competitive drive to fifth. 

Webber finally recorded the second podium of his career at the [[2007 European Grand Prix|European Grand Prix]], after qualifying in 6th position. A rain spiced race, and the retirement of Kimi Räikkönen who was running third at the time, allowed Webber to claim the final position on the podium. However, he almost lost it on the penultimate corner, barely holding off [[Alexander Wurz]].

His best chance at winning a race occurred at the [[2007 Japanese Grand Prix]], where in the wet conditions Webber excelled, running competitively in 2nd place, and setting the 3rd fastest lap of the race only behind the 2 McLarens. Towards the end of the race, Webber was running 2nd behind Lewis Hamilton with no further pit stops to make until [[Sebastian Vettel]], driver for sister team [[Scuderia Toro Rosso]], ran into the back of him under a safety car taking both cars out of the race. He had been lapping faster than Hamilton due to damage on the McLaren's sidepod from contact with Robert Kubica. Out of the current Formula One drivers, Mark has had the second highest number of starts without a win, and is often referred to as the "unluckiest man in modern Formula One",{{Fact|date=September 2007}} a title reinforced in the Japanese Grand Prix 2007, Webber started the race still suffering from food poisoning and vomited inside his helmet during the first safety car period[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/7020434.stm] When questioned by ITV's [[Louise Goodman]] about Vettel's driving and the race ending collision, Webber swore on air, using the [[fuck|f word]].

Webber again looked strong at the final race of the season in [[Brazil]], at [[Interlagos]]. Webber qualified 5th, in front of both [[BMW Sauber]]s, and behind only the Ferraris and McLarens. Webber looked strong in the race, running as high as 4th, before yet another mechanical failure brought an end to an all round disappointing season for the Australian.

==Outside motorsport==
Webber lives in [[Aylesbury]], [[Buckinghamshire]], [[England]] with his girlfriend/manager Ann Neal.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mark Webber &ndash; BMW WilliamsF1 Team Driver| url=http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press_kits/2005/cannes2005/bi_webber.pdf| format=pdf| accessdate=April 20| accessyear=2006}}</ref> Outside motorsport, Webber enjoys "most outdoor pursuits" including [[road cycling]], [[mountain biking]], [[tennis]] and fitness training. He has won the annual F1 Pro-Am tennis tournament in [[Barcelona]] three times (2002, 2004 and 2005), coming runner-up to Juan Pablo Montoya in 2003.<ref>{{cite web| year=May 20, 2004| title=Mark receives congratulations from Juan Pablo Montoya|url=http://www.markwebber.com/gallery/details.cfm?StartRow=13&view_by_Category=7&ViewBy=Category| accessdate=April 20| accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|year=March 27, 2006| title=Pit Stop Tennis Pro-Am teams announced| url=http://www.tennisaustralia.com.au/pages/News.aspx?id=4&PageId=122&HandlerId=2&NewsId=1765| work=Tennis Australia| accessdate=April 20| accessyear=2006}}</ref> Webber is also a [[soccer]] fan, supporting English [[Premier League]] club [[Sunderland AFC]].<ref> http://www.markwebber.com/about/</ref>. His favourite bands are Oasis and INXS. 

===Charity Challenge===
[[Image:MarkWebber2003CharityChallengeMap.png|right|thumb|Route map for Webber's 2003 Challenge]]
In November 2003, Webber set up and competed in a 10-day trek across [[Tasmania]] in an attempt to raise funds for children's [[cancer]] research charities. Starting in Marrawah on the state's west coast, the trek involved 1,000&nbsp;km of cycling, [[kayaking]] and trekking along the southern coast and finished at Coles Bay in the east. Four teams of four competitors each started the trek, with only two teams (including Webber's) completing the entire journey.<ref>{{cite web|year=January 16, 2003| author=Mansen, Jean| title=A New Year for Formula One Racing| url=http://www.jcna.com/library/news/2004/jcna0185.html| work=Jaguar Clubs of North America| accessdate=April 20| accessyear=2006}}</ref> Along the way, Australian sporting stars [[Pat Rafter]], [[Steve Waugh]], [[Cathy Freeman]], [[James Tomkins]], [[Guy Andrews]] and actor [[Joel Edgerton]] completed certain parts of the trek. The challenge concluded with a [[black tie]] dinner and [[auction]] to raise funds. Webber said he was driven to organise the event after the death of his grandfather to cancer, as well as his experiences with friends whose children had battled the disease.<ref>{{cite book | last=Byrne | first=Fiona | title=Sunday Herald Sun (Melbourne) &ndash; Charity drive is the ultimate challenge | origdate=October 19 | origyear=2003 | url=http://www.mollison.com.au/clippings/MB.pdf | format=pdf | accessdate=April 20 | accessyear=2006 | publisher= General News| pages=p. 6}}</ref>

With Webber's switch from Jaguar to Williams at the end of 2004, the challenge was postponed until 2006, when he was able to secure a three-year deal with the [[Government of Tasmania|Tasmanian Government]] to hold the event.<ref>{{cite web| year=March 28, 2006| title=Webber's charity challenge| url=http://www.itv-f1.com/News_Article.aspx?PO_ID=35397| accessdate=April 20| accessyear=2006}}</ref> The 2006 event (now named the "Mark Webber Pure Tasmania Challenge") was held over six days and covered nearly 600&nbsp;km. Twelve teams competed.Webber’s challenge raised A$500,000 for children’s charities. 

The 2007 Mark Webber Pure Tasmania Challenge was launched at the formula one Grand Prix (2007) in Melbourne when Tasmanian aficionado Webber was joined by sports stars and Kylie Minogue, and Hollywood star Anthony Edwards (Top Gun, ER).
 
The 2007 Mark Webber Pure Tasmania Challenge (MWPTC) will be another gruelling physical and mental adventure race about Tasmania in aid of charity but albeit with a new format.  

Teams will compete for honours in two unique categories: the Van Diemen Cup – designed exclusively for corporate teams of four people, and the 2theXtreme Cup – a two person elite team entry.  
Both categories will trek, kayak and cycle alongside each other as they cover approximately 450km through World Heritage wilderness and along the idyllic coast of Freycinet National Park.

The 2007 challenge will be held from 17-23 November. Although the exact course details aren’t being released until 24 hours before the start, it has been revealed that the race will begin in Cradle Mountain, where a ‘prologue’ will determine the running order for the following six days, and finish in Hobart.  And for the first time, one of Webber's fellow F1 drivers, Heikki Kovalainen, will join him in the challenge.

Webber is Tasmania’s unofficial ambassador-at-large and wears ‘discovertasmania.com’ on the chin bar of his racing helmet.
