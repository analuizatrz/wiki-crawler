The '''European Union''' ('''EU''') is a ''[[sui generis]]'' [[supranational union]], made up of twenty-seven member states. It was established as the [[European Economic Community]] in 1957 by the [[Treaty of Rome]] and has undergone many changes since, most notably in 1992 by the [[Maastricht Treaty]]. Since 1957 new [[Enlargement of the European Union|accessions]] have raised the number of [[European Union member states|member states]], and powers have expanded. As a result, the EU can be described as both a [[supranationalism|supranational]] and an [[intergovernmentalism|intergovernmental]] body.

The combined economy of the EU is the largest in the world with a nominal [[gross domestic product|GDP]] of €11.6 ([[US$]]15.7) trillion in 2007.<ref name="GDP IMF"/> The EU has a [[single market]] between [[European Union member state|member states]] with a common trade policy,<ref name="Europa Internal Market">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Activities of the European Union: Internal Market|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://europa.eu/pol/singl/index_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref> a [[Common Agricultural Policy|Common Agricultural]]/[[Common Fisheries Policy|Fisheries Policy]], and a [[European Union Regional policy|regional development policy]].<ref name"Farah">{{cite web|last=Farah|first=Paolo|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Five Years of China WTO Membership.

==History==
{{main|History of the European Union}}
In 1945, at the end of the [[Second World War]], [[Europe]] was marked by unprecedented devastation and human suffering. It faced new political challenges, in particular reconciliation among the peoples of Europe and the growing political division between the [[USA]] and the [[USSR]], two ideologically-opposed superpowers. This situation favoured a long held idea of European unification through the creation of common institutions. 

[[Image:Rometreaty.jpg|thumb|190px|left|The founding nations signing the [[Treaty of Rome]] in 1957]]

In a speech at the [[University of Zurich]] in 1946, [[Winston Churchill]] called for a ''[[United States of Europe]]'' and the creation of a [[Council of Europe]]. The latter was established in [[Strasbourg]] on [[5 May]] [[1949]] as the first European institution. The [[Schuman Declaration]], based on a plan by [[Jean Monnet]] and signed [[9 May]] [[1950]], gave rise to the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC). The aim of the ECSC was to integrate the markets for the industrial resources necessary for reconstruction of Europe, and the production of weapons of war. The founding members of the community, who signed the [[Treaty of Paris (1951)]], were [[Belgium]], [[Netherlands]] and [[Luxembourg]] (who already co-operated as the [[Benelux countries]]), [[France]], [[Italy]] and [[West Germany]].<ref name="ENA WW2">

</ref>

Two additional communities were created by the [[Treaties of Rome]] in 1957; the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC), establishing a [[Customs Union]] and the [[European Atomic Energy Community]] (EAEC or Euratom) for cooperation in [[nuclear energy]]. The ECSC and Euratom were merged into the EEC in 1967 with the signing of the [[Merger Treaty]]. They had a single membership with a combined set of treaties and institutions, and the collective was referred to as the ''European Communities'' (now, the [[European Community]], within the EU).<ref name="ENA Euratom">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=A European Atomic Energy Community|work=|publisher=[[European NAvigator]]|date=|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=3054|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref><ref name="ENA EEC">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=A European Customs Union|work=|publisher=[[European NAvigator]]|date=|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=3056|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref><ref name="ENA Merge">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Merging the executives|work=|publisher=[[European NAvigator]]|date=|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=473|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref>

It also included provisions for common [[immigration policy|policy on the temporary entry of persons]] (including the Schengen Visa), the harmonisation of external [[border]] controls, and cross-border police co-operation. The agreement has been subsequently signed by 30 states, including most EU member states and three non-EU members ([[Iceland]], [[Norway]] and [[Switzerland]]). By 2007 15 member states had implemented the agreement. The [[Republic of Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom]] take part only in the police co-operation measures and not in common border control and visa provisions.<ref name="Europa Schengen acquis">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=The Schengen acquis and its integration into the Union|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=2005|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/l33020.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-28}}</ref> Later in 1985, [[Jacques Delors]] became [[President of the European Commission]]. Serving until 1995, [[Delors Commission|his commission]] is the longest serving and is considered by some as the most successful, a gold standard by which future Commissions are judged in giving the Community a sense of direction and dynamism.<ref name="BM New Commission">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=The new Commission - some initial thoughts|work=|publisher=Burson-Marsteller|date=2004|url=http://www.bmbrussels.be/box_bmnewcomm.php|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-08-14}}</ref>

In 1986 the [[European flag]] was adopted and leaders signed the [[Single European Act]]. In 1989, [[Reunification of Germany|Germany reunified]] after the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], and the former [[East Germany]] joined the enlarged Germany in EU membership. With enlargement toward eastern Europe on the agenda, the [[Copenhagen Criteria]] were agreed and the [[Maastricht Treaty]] formally established the EU on [[1 November]] [[1993]]. With that treaty, the European Community became one of [[three pillars of the European Union|three pillars of the EU]], alongside new areas of integration: [[Common Foreign and Security Policy|foreign policy]] and [[Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters|interior affairs]].<ref name="Europa History 80-89">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=1980-1989 The changing face of Europe - the fall of the Berlin Wall|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://europa.eu/abc/history/1980-1989/index_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref><ref name="Europa History 90-99">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=A Europe without frontiers|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://europa.eu/abc/history/1990-1999/index_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref>

[[Image:Thefalloftheberlinwall1989.JPG|thumb|190px|The fall of the [[Iron Curtain]] marked a new era in [[Eastern Europe]] and laid the foundations of further [[Enlargement of the European Union|enlargement]]]]

In 1994 the [[European Economic Area]] was established, allowing the non-members [[Iceland]], [[Liechtenstein]] and [[Norway]] access to the EU's [[single market]]. In 1995 [[Austria]], [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]] joined the EU. The [[Amsterdam Treaty]] was signed in 1999, shortly after the [[Santer Commission#Resignation|resignation of the Santer Commission]]. In the same year the [[euro]] was introduced for bank transfers, and euro coins and banknotes replaced national currencies in 12 of the member states in 2002. In 2003 the [[Nice Treaty]] came into force, followed a year later by the [[Enlargement of the European Union|accession]] of ten countries (eight central and eastern European countries plus [[Malta]] and [[Cyprus]]).<ref name="Europa History 90-99"/><ref name="Europa History 00">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=A decade of further expansion|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://europa.eu/abc/history/2000_today/index_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref>

Later in 2004, the [[European Constitution]] was signed in Rome, though it was never fully ratified after rejection by French and Dutch voters in [[referendum]]s. In 2007, it was agreed to replace that proposal with a new [[Reform Treaty]] (or "Lisbon Treaty") that would not have constitutional elements but would reform [[Treaties of the European Union|existing treaties]]. At the start of that year [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] joined the EU and the euro was adopted by [[Slovenia]]. It was agreed to allow Cyprus and Malta to adopt the euro at the start of 2008.<ref name="Europa History 00"/>

==Member states==
{{main|European Union member state|Enlargement of the European Union}}

The [[European Coal and Steel Community]] was founded in 1952 by six countries. Between 1973 and 2007 there have been six waves of enlargement bringing the current membership up to 27. The largest enlargement occurred in 2004 when 10 members joined at the same time.<ref name="Delegation History">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Brief History of European Integration|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Delegation to Japan]]|date=|url=http://jpn.cec.eu.int/union/showpage_en_union.history.php|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-24}}</ref> There are currently three official candidate countries, [[Croatia]], the [[former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]] and [[Turkey]].

To join the EU, a country must meet the [[Copenhagen criteria]], defined at the 1993 [[Copenhagen]] European Council. These require a stable democracy respecting [[human rights]] and the [[rule of law]]; a functioning market economy capable of competition within the EU and the acceptance of the obligations of membership, including EU laws. Evaluation of a country's fulfilment of the criteria rests with the [[European Council]].<ref name="Accession Criteria">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Accession criteria (Copenhagen criteria)|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/accession_criteria_copenhague_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref> Enlargement has been seen as a positive force by many, for example in democratising Eastern Europe<ref name="Enlargement voice"/> and causing war crimes suspects in the former [[Yugoslavia]] to be brought to the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|ICTY]].<ref name="EUObserver ICTY">{{cite web|last=Kubosova|first=Lucia|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Del Ponte: EU enlargement bringing justice to Balkans|work=|publisher=EU Observer|date=2007|url=http://euobserver.com/9/24360|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref>

Some parts of member countries are not part of the EU, although they are part of the European continent. Examples include the [[Channel Islands]] and [[Faroe Islands]]. Several territories associated with member states that are outside geographic Europe are also not part of the EU (such as [[Greenland]], [[Aruba]], the [[Netherlands Antilles]] and all the non-European territories associated with the [[United Kingdom]]). On the other hand, some overseas territories are formally part of the EU even if they are not geographically part of Europe, such as the [[Azores]], the [[Canary Islands]], [[French Guiana]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Madeira]], [[Martinique]] and [[Réunion]].<ref name="Amsterdam">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Treaty of Amsterdam|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Eur-Lex]]: Official Journal|date=|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/treaties/dat/11997D/htm/11997D.html|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref><ref name="Consolidated Treaties">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Consolidated Treaties on European Union and establishing the European Community|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Eur-Lex]]|date=|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2006:321E:0001:0331:EN:pdf|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref><ref name="ECB where euro">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Where is the euro legal tender?|work=|publisher=[[European Central Bank]]|date=2006|url=http://www.ecb.int/bc/faqbc/circulation/html/index.en.html#q2|format=PDF|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref>

==Governance==
{{Main|Institutions of the European Union}}
[[Image:Institutions europeennes IMG 4307.jpg|thumb|150px|The [[European Parliament|Parliament]] in [[Strasbourg]] is a [[legislative]] chamber of the EU]]
The EU is governed by a number of institutions, primarily the [[European Commission|Commission]], [[Council of the European Union|Council]] and [[European Parliament|Parliament]]. The [[European Commission]] acts as the [[executive branch]]. It is currently composed of 27 commissioners, one from each member state. The commission is responsible for drafting all proposed rules in order to co-ordinate European Law. It also controls some agencies and is responsible for the day-to-day running of the EU. The president of the commission is nominated by the European Council, and confirmed by the Parliament.<ref name="Europa Institutions Commission">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Institutions: The European Commission|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/comm/index_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref> The [[statistical]] arm of the European Commission is the [[Eurostat]]. Eurostat's key role is to supply statistics to the European Commission, other EU institutions and bodies to help define, implement and analyse EU's policies.

The [[Council of the European Union]] (also known as the Council of Ministers) forms one half of the EU's [[legislative branch]], the other being the Parliament. It is composed of the national ministers responsible for the area of EU law being addressed. For example, European legislation regarding agriculture would be treated by a Council composed of the national ministers for agriculture. The body's presidency rotates between the member states every six months. To increase stability the current president member state co-operates with both the previous and the next president member state.<ref name="Europa Institutions Council">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Institutions: The Council of the European Union|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/council/index_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref> It should not be confused with the [[European Council]], which is not an official institution (although the European Council is an important body and shares its presidency with that of the Council of the EU). It is composed of the heads of government and the [[President of the European Commission]]. The European Council meets four times a year.<ref name="Europa Institutions ECouncil">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=European Council|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Council of the European Union]]|date=|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/cms3_fo/showPage.asp?id=429&lang=en|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref> 

[[Image:European Commission outside.jpg|thumb|left|[[Brussels]] hosts many institutions, such as the [[Council of the European Union|Council]] and [[European Commission|Commission]]]]
The other half of the legislative branch is the [[European Parliament]] and is the only EU body composed of representatives directly elected by the citizens of the [[EU member states]]. Every five years citizens in all member states elect 785 [[Member of the European Parliament|Members of the European Parliament]] (MEPs) who form the second half of the EU's legislative branch. Although the elections are for national candidates, the members of the parliament have seats according to political ideals rather than nationality. The chair of the parliament is elected by its members.<ref name="Europa Institutions Parliament">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Institutions: The European Parliament|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/parliament/index_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref>

The Parliament is the only institution to have its official seat in the city of [[Strasbourg]]. [[Brussels]] plays host to the Commission, Council and some meetings of the Parliament. Hence the latter is often considered the ''de facto'' capital of the EU. However the Courts, and some meetings and departments of the other institutions, are in [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]].<ref name="Brussels Capital">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Brussels, Capital of Europe|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Commission]]|date=2001|url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/policy_advisers/archives/publications/docs/brussels_capital.pdf|format=PDF|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref><ref name="Council Edinburgh">{{cite web|last=European Council|first=|authorlink=European Council|coauthors=|title=European Council in Edinburgh: 11 - 12 December 1992, Annex 6 to Part A|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|date=1992|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/summits/edinburgh/a6_en.pdf|format=PDF|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-24}}</ref>

===Judiciary and law===
{{see|European Court of Justice|Law of the European Union|Treaties of the European Union}}
[[Image:EUCoJ.jpg|thumb|The [[European Court of Justice|Court of Justice]] in [[Luxembourg]] is the highest authority for [[European Union law|EU law]]]]
The [[Judicial branch]] of the EU consists primarily of the [[European Court of Justice]] composed of 27 judges, one judge being nominated by each member-state. The president is elected from the judges. The Court has is the highest court on matters of [[Law of the European Union|European law]], that which is proposed by the Commission rather than national governments. Below the Court of Justice there is a lower court called the [[Court of First Instance]] created to reduce the work load of the Court of Justice. There is also the [[European Court of Auditors]], which monitors the EU's accounts.<ref name="Europa Institutions Justice">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Institutions: Court of Justice|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/justice/index_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref><ref name="Europa Institutions Auditors">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Institutions: Court of Auditors|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/auditors/index_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref><ref name="Europa Institutions Commission"/>

EU law is the first and only example of a [[supranationalism|supranational]] legal framework.

EU law covers a broad range of topics, often as broad as the legislation of the member states.<ref name="Consolidated Treaties"/> Where a conflict arises between EU law and the law of a member state, EU law takes precedence.<ref name="Supremacy">In general, see C 6/64, ''Falminio Costa v. ENEL'' [1964] ECR 585, 593; in the UK see, [[Factortame case|''Factortame Ltd. v Secretary of State for Transport (No. 2) [1991] 1 AC 603'']]; in Germany see ''Solange II'' (''Re Wuensche Handelsgesellschaft'', BVerfG decision of 22 Oct. 1986 [1987] 3 CMLR 225,265); in Italy see ''Frontini v.

This means that private citizens can call upon the rights granted to them (and the duties created for them) by EU legislation. For instance, an air hostess could sue her employer for sexual discrimination based on legislation provided in EU treaties.<ref> Under Art. 141 [[Maastricht Treaty|TEC]], C-43/75 ''Defrenne v. Sabena'' [[1976]] ECR 455</ref> The other legal instrument of the EU, called [[European Union directive|directives]], also may have a direct effect in limited circumstances (when a provision of a directive is clear, precise and unconditional), but only "vertically" - meaning that private persons can call upon their rights against their state, but not other persons.<ref name="EUPARL 1.2.1">{{cite web | url = http://www.europarl.europa.eu/facts_2004/1_2_1_en.htm

Directives allow some choice for member states in the way they translate a directive into national law.

The EU is founded upon a number of [[Treaties of the European Union|treaties]]. In 1951 the [[Treaty of Paris (1951)|Treaty of Paris]] created the ECSC. This was followed in 1957 by the [[Treaties of Rome]] which created [[Euratom]] and the [[European Economic Community]] (Treaty of the European Community). The latter of these is today the core document of the [[European Community]] pillar of the EU. A number of further treaties [[Merger Treaty|merged the communities]] and [[Single European Act|added competencies]] which laid the foundations for the [[Maastricht Treaty]] (Treaty on the European Union). Maastricht created [[three pillars of the European Union]]. The first would be the former Community. It would be joined by the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]] and [[Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters|Justice and Home Affairs]]. These were based more on [[intergovernmental]] decision making, rather than the [[supranational]] system of the European Community. The [[Treaty of Amsterdam]] and the [[Nice Treaty|Treaty of Nice]] saw a number of changes. The Parliament's power increased with the extension of [[codecision procedure]] and powers were transferred from Justice and Home Affairs to the European Community (the former now renamed ''Police and Judicial Cooperation in Criminal Matters''.<ref name="Europa Treaties">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=European treaties|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=2005|url=http://europa.eu/abc/treaties/index_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-30}}</ref> The Proposed [[Reform Treaty]] would abolish the pillar system, although the intergovernmental style in those areas will largely remain.<ref name="Euractiv PJC"/>

==Politics==
{{main|Politics of the European Union}}
[[Image:Josesocrates2006.jpg|thumb|The [[President-in-Office of the European Council]], [[José Sócrates]], helps guide the direction of the EU]]

The politics of the EU primarily cover the economy, which is reminiscent of its history originating in a series of economic communities after the Second World War. When the Maastricht Treaty established the EU, the scope was expanded to the [[Three pillars of the European Union|pillar system]] whereby foreign and home affairs were added to the intergovernmental domain of the EU.<ref name="Glossary Pillars">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Pillars of the European Union|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/eu_pillars_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref> Political direction in the EU is given by the European Council, headed by the rotating presidency.<ref name="Europa Institutions ECouncil"/> Citizens participate through the [[European Parliament]] which is elected every five years.<ref name="Europa Institutions Parliament"/>

===Integration===
{{main|European integration|Enlargement of the European Union}}
The expansion of the EU has been seen as a means for promoting and reinforcing peace and democracy on the European continent following the Second World War and later after the decline of the [[Soviet Union]]. Another aim of the EU has always been to increase its economic prosperity.<ref name="Enlargement voice">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=EU enlargement - voices from the debate|work=|publisher=British [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]]|date=|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&c=Page&cid=1139992114487|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref> There is disagreement on how far the EU should expand however. Some favour further enlargement to continue using the positive influence membership prospects have on neighbouring countries, while others fear "over-stretch". Some believe the European public in particular are suffering from "enlargement fatigue" following the accession of 10 members in 2004.<ref name="IHT fatigue">{{cite web|last=Smale|first=Alison|authorlink=|last2=Bilefsky|first2=Dan|coauthors=|title=Fighting EU 'enlargement fatigue'|work=|publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]]|date=[[2006-06-19]]|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/06/19/news/eu.php|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-08-14}}</ref> [[Turkey]] is a particularly controversial topic, considering its large population, low [[standard of living]], [[Muslim]] culture, [[Asia minor|geographical position]] and ongoing [[Cyprus dispute|disagreements over Cyprus]].

Accession to the European treaties necessarily means to give over some powers from the national government to a supranational governmental organisation. The powers that passed from national governments to the EU are considered large. The ongoing integration of Europe is becoming contested on the grounds that it reduces members' national sovereignty too much.<ref name="Anti-EU">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=FAQs on the EU, from the campaign trail|work=|publisher=Sovereignty|date=2001|url=http://www.sovereignty.org.uk/features/articles/campquest.html|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref> Enlargement together with integration (new treaties) are seen by some as parallel processes, vital to the EU or it will fail: this is known as the "bicycle theory".<ref name="FT Bicycle">{{cite web|last=Bounds|first=Andrew|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Brussels blog: Bicycle wobbles on the way to Doha|work=|publisher=[[Financial Times]]|date=2007|url=http://blogs.ft.com/brusselsblog/2007/05/bicycle_wobbles.html|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref>

===Reform===
{{main|Reform Treaty}}
To govern and guide the ongoing integration and the larger number of member states the [[European Constitution]] was proposed. However ratification of this treaty was rejected by Dutch and French voters.<ref name="BBC Reform">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=EU leaders agree on reform treaty|work=|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6232540.stm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref>
[[Image:EU Constitution Ratification Map.svg|thumb|left|The [[European Constitution|Constitution]] was rejected by voters in two states (red)]]
By the end of 2007, a new "[[Reform Treaty]]" should agreed upon by the leaders to come into force in 2009. The new treaty would carry out most of the reforms envisaged in the Constitutions but without the constitutional elements and would add to, not replace, the existing treaties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://euobserver.com/9/24522|title=EU unveils bulky new treaty draft|publisher=EU Observer|date=[[2007-07-09]]|accessdate=2007-07-23}}</ref>

In discussions on reform, there has been a desire to address the [[democratic deficit in the European Union|democratic deficit of the EU]] through the development of [[citizenship of the European Union|citizenship of the EU]]. Citizens have a number or rights including the right to vote and to stand as candidates in local government and [[Elections in the European Union|European Parliament elections]] in any member state.<ref name="Europa Citizenship">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=European citizenship|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Commission]]|url=http://ec.europa.eu/youreurope/nav/en/citizens/citizenship/citizenship/index.html|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-01-24}}</ref> However there has been falling turnout at elections, with few political structures at EU level and no cohesive European [[civil society]].

===Budget===
{{main|Budget of the European Union}}
Further important political issues concern the [[Budget of the European Union|EU budget]]. The [[Financial Perspective]] for 2007–2013 was defined in 2005 when EU members agreed to fix the common budget to 1.045% of the EU's [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]].<ref name="Financial 2007">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Financial Perspective 2007–2013|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Consilium]]|date=2005|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressData/en/misc/87677.pdf|format=PDF|doi=|accessdate=2007-01-17}}</ref> However there are long running disputes over the [[Common Agricultural Policy]] and the [[UK rebate]]. The UK rebate is a special discount on the UK contributions to the EU budget. The rebate was allowed as the UK was receiving relatively little agricultural support compared to other countries. The agricultural policy has historically dominated much of the EU's spending. Reduction of the agricultural spending and abolition of the UK rebate are listed as important reforms of the system by various groups. This is however problematic as unanimity is required to change these agreements, meaning that both the gross receivers from agricultural policies and the UK have to give up a privileged position. So far no agreement has been reached.<ref name="BBC Rebate">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title= Fact check: Britain's EU rebate|work=|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2005|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4094652.stm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref>

===Justice, freedom and security===
{{main|Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters|European Commissioner for Justice, Freedom & Security}}
[[Image:SchengenAgreement map.png|thumb|Schengen opened borders between its members (blue) prompting cross border police cooperation]]

There are a number of fields of co-operation concerning matters of policing and justice. The stated idea of such cooperation is to create an "area of Justice, Freedom and Security" in Europe. These areas are largely in the domain of the [[Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters|third of the EU's three pillars]], meaning it is dealt with primarily between states rather than through the Commission and Parliament. This would remain the case even with the proposal for abolition of the pillar system under the Reform Treaty. However there is still Community involvement over matters such as the [[Schengen Agreement]] and [[human rights]]. Community powers had previously been extended by the Amsterdam Treaty.<ref name="Council PJC">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Police and Judicial Cooperation (PJC)|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Council of the European Union]]|date=2007|url=http://consilium.europa.eu/cms3_fo/showPage.asp?id=475&lang=EN&mode=g|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref><ref name="Euractiv PJC">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters: Will the EU Constitutional Treaty Keep it Together?|work=|publisher=Euractiv|date=2007|url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/justice/police-judicial-operation-criminal-matters-eu-constitutional-treaty-keep/article-117047|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref>

The Schengen area has opened borders between its member states (some EU members, and some outside the EU), and has hence led to greater cross-border cooperation. This is conducted through bodies such as the [[Europol]] (a police agency), [[Eurojust]] (justice cooperation)<ref name="Euractiv PJC"/> and [[Frontex]] (border control).<ref name="Frontex Tasks">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Tasks|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Frontex]]|date=2007|url=http://www.frontex.europa.eu/origin_and_tasks/tasks/|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-08-12}}</ref> Furthermore, the [[Schengen Information System]] provides a common police database<ref name="SP Shengen">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=The Schengen acquis and its integration into the Union|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=2007|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/l33020.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-08-12}}</ref> and the [[European Arrest Warrant]] allows a faster extradition to another EU state.<ref name="SP EAW">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=European Arrest Warrent|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=2007|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/l33167.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-08-12}}</ref>

In addition to criminal cooperation, the EU also deals with human rights. The [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] was proclaimed in 2000 to ensure citizens rights were protected.

==Foreign relations==

[[Image:Javier Solana (2007).jpg|thumb|The [[High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy|High Representative]], [[Javier Solana]], is the EU's spokesperson on foreign policy]]

The foreign relations of the EU are primarily dealt with through the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). The CFSP has its origins in the [[Maastricht Treaty]] of 1992 where foreign policy was established as the second of [[three pillars of the European Union|three pillars]] in the EU. The CFSP were further defined and broadened in the [[Amsterdam Treaty]] of 1997. The Amsterdam treaty defined five objectives for the CFSP: to safeguard the common values, fundamental interests, independence and integrity of the EU in conformity with the principles of the [[United Nations Charter]]; to strengthen the security of the EU in all ways; to preserve peace and strengthen international security, in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter, as well as the principles of the [[Helsinki Final Act]] and the objectives of the [[Paris Charter]], including those on external borders; to promote international co-operation; and to develop and consolidate democracy and the [[rule of law]], and respect for [[human rights]] and fundamental freedoms. The foreign and security policy is coordinated by the [[High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy]], currently [[Javier Solana]].<ref name="Europa CFSP">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) - Overview|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Commission]]|date=2002|url=http://ec.europa.eu/external_relations/cfsp/intro/index.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref> When policy is agreed, the High Representative can speak for the EU, for example at the [[United Nations]] (UN).

===Military and defence===
{{main|European Security and Defence Policy|Military of the European Union}}

The EU itself has limited military capability of its own. Member states are responsible for their own territorial defence, alongside [[NATO]] which provides common military capabilities and assurances. However the membership of NATO and the EU are not identical. Furthermore, the [[Western European Union]] (WEU) is a separate European security organisation related to the EU. In 1992, the WEU's relationship to the EU was defined, with the EU giving it the "[[Petersberg tasks]]" (humanitarian missions such as peacekeeping and crisis management). The tasks were later transferred from the WEU to the EU by the Amsterdam Treaty; they formed part of the new CFSP and the [[European Security and Defence Policy]]. Elements of the WEU are currently being merged into the EU's CFSP; the President of the WEU is currently CFSP High Representative.<ref name="Europa ESDP">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=EU Security Police & the role of the European Commission|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Commission]]|date=|url=http://ec.europa.eu/external_relations/cfsp/esdp/index.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref><ref name="Europa Chronology">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=EU Security Police & the role of the European Commission: Chronology|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Commission]]|date=|url=http://ec.europa.eu/external_relations/cfsp/esdp/chrono.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref>

[[Image:Eufor222.jpg|thumb|left|[[Military of the European Union|EU forces]] are peacekeeping in areas such as the [[Balkans]]]]

Following the [[Kosovo war]] in 1999, the European Council agreed that "the Union must have the capacity for autonomous action, backed by credible military forces, the means to decide to use them, and the readiness to do so, in order to respond to international crises without prejudice to actions by NATO." To that end, a number of independent forces have been created, answerable to the European Council rather than NATO or member states. These include a 60,000-member [[European Rapid Reaction Force]] and [[EU Battlegroups]] of 15,000 men.<ref name="Council Capabilities">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Capabilities|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Council of the European Union]]|date=|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/cms3_fo/showPage.asp?id=437&lang=EN&mode=g|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref> Forces have been deployed on [[peacekeeping]] missions from [[Africa]] to the former [[Yugoslavia]] and the [[middle east]].<ref name="Council Operations">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=EU Operations|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Council of the European Union]]|date=|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/cms3_fo/showPage.asp?id=268&lang=EN&mode=g|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref> These are supported by a number of bodies, including the [[European Defence Agency]], [[European Union Satellite Centre|satellite centre]] and the [[European Union Military Staff|military staff]].<ref name="Council Structures">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=ESPD Structures|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Council of the European Union]]|date=|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/cms3_fo/showPage.asp?id=279&lang=EN&mode=g|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref>

The [[Common Agricultural Policy]] (CAP) is one the oldest policies of the European Community and was once, one of its central planks.<ref name="stead">{{cite web|last=Stead|first=David|authorlink=|coauthors=Robert Whaples (eds)|title=Common Agricultural Policy|work=|publisher=EH.Net Encyclopedia|date=[[2007-06-22]]|url=http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/Stead.CAP|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-08-30}}</ref>The policy has the objectives of increasing agricultural production, providing certainty in food supplies, ensuring a high quality of life for farmers, stabilising markets and insuring reasonable prices for consumers (article 33 of the Treaty of Rome).<ref name="Consolidated Treaties"/> It was, until recently, operated by a system of subsidies and market intervention, and up until the 1990s accounted for over half of the then European Communities' annual budget, and still accounts for around forty percent of the EU's budget.<ref name="stead"/>

[[Image:Neftochim-vaya-dinev.jpg|thumb|left|EU farms are supported by the [[Common Agricultural Policy|CAP]], the largest [[EU budget|budgetary]] expenditure ([[Burgas]], Bulgaria)]]

The policy's price controls and market interventions led to a great deal of overproduction resulting in the so-called wine lakes and beef mountains. These were intervention stores which were built up from produce bought by the Community to insure minimum price levels. In order to reduce the levels of these stores, agricultural produce was often sold on the world market at prices considerably below what was paid for it, or farmers were offered subsidies (amounting to the difference between the Community and world prices) to export their produce outside the Community. This is often criticised on the grounds that the subsidised produce under-cuts farmers in the developing world.<ref name="Guardian CAP">{{cite web|last=Jeffery|first=Simon|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=The EU common agricultural policy|work=|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=[[2007-06-26]]|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/theissues/article/0,,975350,00.html|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-08-30}}</ref> The overproduction has also been criticised on environmental grounds in that it encourages environmentally unfriendly intensive farming methods.<ref name="Guardian CAP"/> Supports of CAP say that the economic support it provides farmers to a reasonable standard of living in what would otherwise be an economically unviable way of life.

Since the beginning of the 1990s CAP has been subject to a series of reforms.

===Energy===
{{main|Energy policy of the European Union}}
[[Image:RF NG pipestoEU.gif|thumb|170px|[[Pipeline transport|Pipeline]]s from Russia to Europe]]

The EU has been a legislative power in the area of energy policy for many years. This involvement evolved from of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]]. The introduction of a mandatory and comprehensive European energy policy was approved at the meeting of the [[European Council]] in October 2005 and the first draft policy was published in January 2007.<ref name="Energy Q&A">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Q&A: EU energy plans|work=|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=[[2007-03-09]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4783996.stm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-13}}</ref>

The EU currently imports 82% of its [[petroleum|oil]] and 57% of its [[natural gas|gas]], making it the world's leading importer of these fuels.<ref name="low carb prop">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title='Low-carbon economy' proposed for Europe|work=|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|date=|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16560106/|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-01-24}}</ref> In 2007, member states legally bound the EU to use 20% [[renewable energy]] and cut [[carbon dioxide]] [[Greenhouse gas|emissions]] by at least 20% from [[1990]] levels, by [[2020]].<ref name="EUO energy">{{cite web|last=Rettman|first=Andrew|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=EU sticks out neck in global climate change battle|work=|publisher=EU Observer|date=[[2007-03-09]]|url=http://euobserver.com/9/23665|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-03-09}}</ref> In 2020, one-tenth of all cars and trucks in [[Treaty of Accession 2005|EU 27]] are agreed to be running on [[biofuel]]s.

Despite this, there are still concerns that the EU is largely dependent upon [[Russia]] for its energy. This concern has grown particularly acute following a series of [[Russia-Ukraine gas dispute|clashes]] between Russia and its neighbours as Russia rose the price of its exports.  As a result the EU is attempting to diversify its energy supply.<ref name="Energy Russia">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Ukraine-Russia gas dispute - call for stronger EU energy policy|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/public/story_page/051-4234-012-01-02-909-20060112STO04233-2006-12-01-2006/default_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-08-21}}</ref>

===Infrastructure===
{{see|European Commissioner for Transport|European Commissioner for Enterprise and Industry}}<!--Galileo comes under the latter, not Transport-->

The EU is working to improve cross-border [[infrastructure]], for example through the [[Trans-European Networks]] (TEN). Projects under TEN include the [[Channel Tunnel]], [[TGV Est]], the [[Fréjus Rail Tunnel]], the [[Oresund bridge]] and the [[Brenner Base Tunnel]]. In 2001 it was estimated that by 2010 the network would cover: 75,200&nbsp;km of roads; 78,00&nbsp;km of railways; 330 airports; 270 maritime harbours; and 210 internal harbours.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=The trans-European transport network: new guidelines and financial rules|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Commission]]|date=[[2003-10-01]]|url=http://ec.europa.eu/ten/transport/revision/doc/revision_1692_memo_en.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-08-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Mirea|first=Silvia|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=The trans-European transport network: new guidelines and financial rules|work=|publisher=The Railway Journal|date=|url=http://www.cfr.ro/jf/engleza/0304/ten-t.htm|accessdate=2007-08-15}}</ref>

In developing European transport policy, there are environmental pressures on proposals to increase the transport network. With enlargement, a problem policy has had to tackle is the differences between the older and newer member states. In the EU 15, there is a major problem with congestion and pollution, while in the states that joined since 2004, the problem is accessibility.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=White Paper on Transport|work=|publisher=Euractiv|date=[[2004-09-22]]|url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/transport/white-paper-transport/article-129628|format=|accessdate=2007-08-15}}</ref> The [[Roads and expressways in Poland|Polish road network]] in particular was in poor condition.

[[Image:Windkraftanlagen Dänemark.jpg|thumb|[[Renewable energy]] is one priority in transnational research activities such as the [[Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)|(FP7)]] ]]

Education and science are areas where the EU's role is limited in its support. In education, policy mainly developed in the 1980s with programmes supporting exchanges and mobility. The most visible of these has been the [[ERASMUS programme]], a university exchange programme which began in 1987. In its first 20 years it has supported international exchange opportunities for well over 1.5 million university and college students and become a symbol of Europe and student life. In France, where 217,000 students have participated, the programme became the subject of a film in 2002, [[L'Auberge espagnole]].<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=The Erasmus programme celebrates its 20th aniversary|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/news/erasmus20_en.html|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Jean-Sébastien|first=Lefebvre|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Erasmus turns 20 - time to grow up?|date=[[2007-01-22]]|publisher=Café Babel|date=|url=http://www.cafebabel.com/en/article.asp?T=T&Id=9702|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-08-10}}</ref> There are now similar programmes for school pupils and teachers, for trainees in vocational education and training, and for adult learners in the [[Lifelong Learning Programme 2007-2013]].

Scientific support is offered through the EU's [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development|Framework Programmes]], the first of which was in 1984. The aims of EU policy in this area are to coordinate and stimulate research. The independent [[European Research Council]] allocates EU funds to European or national research projects.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=European Research Council: What is the ERC?|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://erc.europa.eu/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.display&topicID=12|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-21}}</ref> Since January 2000 the [[European Commission]] has set its sights on a wider objective, known as the [[European Research Area]]. This has the support of all member states, and extends the existing financing structure of the frameworks. It aims to focus on coordination, sharing knowledge, ensuring mobility of researchers around Europe, improving conditions for researchers and encouraging links with business and industry as well as removing any legal and administrative barriers.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=What is the European Research Area?|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://ec.europa.eu/research/era/index_en.html|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-21}}</ref>

The [[College of Europe]] (based in [[Bruges]] and [[Natolin]]) was the first European educational establishment, being founded in 1949. It is financially supported by the EU and many students go on to work with the European institutions. Student's places are allocated according to the size of the member state, so it is seen as a reproduction of European society.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pierre-Alban|first=Pillet|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=A European Higher Education System is Taking Shape|work=|publisher=Café Babel|date=[[2007-03-22]]|url=http://www.cafebabel.com/en/article.asp?T=T&Id=1371|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-08-10}}</ref> In further effort to build a European science base, and to improve the competitive edge of the EU in the area of innovation and technology, the commission has proposed the foundation of a [[European Institute of Innovation and Technology]]. It has not been decided whether this plan will include its own campus, or will be mainly a network of existing research facilities in the EU.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=European Institute of Technology|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/policies/educ/eit/index_en.html|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-21}}</ref>

===Culture===
{{see|Culture of Europe|Cultural policies of the European Union}}

The EU has no specific culture or cultural history, other than those of its member states, so EU culture is intertwined with the [[culture of Europe]]. Within the EU, supporters of [[European integration]] often appeal to a shared European historical/cultural heritage, typically including [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]], the [[feudalism]] of the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Renaissance]], the [[Age of Enlightenment]], 19th century [[Liberalism]] and (sometimes) negative elements such as the [[World Wars]]. European values are assumed to be grounded in this shared heritage.<ref>For example: {{cite web | url = http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/expert/infopress_page/008-3007-043-02-07-901-20070208IPR02888-12-02-2007-2007-true/default_en.htm | title =Priority is dialogue for partnership and tolerance | accessdate = 2007-07-18 | author = Hans-Gert Poettering| authorlink = Hans-Gert Pöttering| date = 2007-02-13 | work = Inaugural speech by the new president of the European Parliament | publisher = European Parliament | quote = }}</ref> This heritage can often be invoked to encourage a sense of shared heritage and pride in it: in March 2007, for the 50th anniversary of the Treaties of Rome, a piece of art from each state was sent to Rome for a special exhibition. Such art varied from historical pieces such as [[Auguste Rodin]]'s ''[[The Thinker]]'' to modern works such as [[Per Kirkeby]]'s ''Prophecy on Venice''.<ref name="Culture Rome">{{cite web|last=Barber|first=Tony|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Rome shows Europe its heart of art|work=|publisher=[[Financial Times]]|date=[[2007-03-16]]|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/1ce6e3ec-d3e4-11db-8889-000b5df10621,dwp_uuid=176e2654-91dc-11db-a945-0000779e2340.html|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-08-05}}</ref> Displays of such artwork can also be see on [[euro coins]], where countries choose to depict a symbol of national pride such as a building or artist, for example [[France Prešeren]] or ''the [[Vitruvian Man]]''.<ref name="Euro Coins">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Euro coins|work=|publisher=[[European Central Bank]]|date=|url=http://www.ecb.int/bc/euro/coins/html/index.en.html|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-08-05}}</ref>

[[Image:Oldtraffordpitch.jpg|thumb|[[Old Trafford (football ground)|Old Trafford stadium]] saw a European team compete in football, a popular sport across the EU]]

[[Sport policies of the European Union|Sport policy]] is largely the domain of the member states, with the EU mostly playing an indirect role. The role of the EU might increase in the future, if (for example) the [[Reform Treaty]] were to be ratified by all member states.<ref name"EUO Sport">{{cite web|last=Goldirova|first=Renata|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Brussels' first-ever move into sport area set to spark controversy|work=|publisher=EU Observer|date=[[2007-07-11]]|url=http://euobserver.com/9/24455|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-13}}</ref> Recently the EU launched an anti-doping convention. Other policies of the EU have had an impact on sports, such as the freedom of employment which was at the core of the [[Bosman ruling]], which prohibited national football leagues from imposing quotas on foreign players with EU nationality.<ref name"BBC Boseman">{{cite web|last=Fordyce|first=Tom|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=10 years since Bosman|work=|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=[[2007-07-11]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4528732.stm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-13}}</ref>

Various [[spectator sports]] are popular throughout Europe, such as [[Football (soccer)|football]]. In the same manner that artistic heritage is drawn on by the EU, football has also been drawn on. On [[9 February]] [[2007]], for the 50th anniversary of the Rome Treaty, a European football team was formed to take on [[Manchester United Football Club]] in a friendly match. It was also the 50th anniversary of Manchester's first participation in the [[UEFA cup]]. The "[[Marcello Lippi#Europe XI|Europe XI]]" [[Marcello Lippi|team coach]] described the importance of the game to Europe in the following terms: ''"Football brings people together. In a continent so proud of its cultural diversity, football offers a common language. It helps to integrate different communities. At its best, our sport conveys some of Europe’s basic values: the rule of law, respect for others, freedom of expression, teamwork and solidarity."''<ref name"Football Manchester">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=EU 50th Anniversary Football Match|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=[[2007-02-09]]|url=http://ec.europa.eu/unitedkingdom/information/focus/football_en.htm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-08-10}}</ref> Although the combined team was a one off for that event, Commission President [[Romano Prodi]] proposed that the national teams entering the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Olympics]] in [[Beijing]] carry the [[European flag]] in addition to their national flag as a show of unity.

===Environment===
{{main|European Commissioner for the Environment}}
The first European environmental policy was launched in 1972. Since then it has addressed issues such as [[acid rain]], the thinning of the [[ozone layer]], [[air quality]], [[noise pollution]], [[waste]] and [[EU water policy|water pollution]]. The [[Water framework directive]] is an example of the water policy; the aim is for rivers, lake, ground and coastal waters to be of "good quality" by 2015. Wildlife is protected through the [[Natura 2000]] programme  and covers 30,000 sites throughout Europe.<ref name="BBC Dimas">{{cite web|last=Dimas|first=Stavros|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Celebrating the Environmental Union|work=|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=[[2007-03-23]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6476273.stm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-08-15}}</ref> In 2007, the Polish government sought to build a motorway through the [[Rospuda River|Rospuda valley]], but the Commission has been blocking construction as the valley is a wildlife area covered by the programme.<ref name="FT Respuda">{{cite web|last=Dimas|first=Stavros|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Celebrating the Environmental Union|work=|publisher=[[Financial Times]]|date=[[2007-03-23]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6476273.stm|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-08-15}}</ref>

[[Image:Rospuda river1.jpg|thumb|left|The Commission is trying to protect the [[Rospuda River|Rospuda vally]] in Poland from motorway construction]]
The [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals|REACH directive]] was a large piece of legislation passed in 2006 which is designed to ensure 30,000 chemicals which are in daily use are tested for their safety.<ref name="RTE REACH">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=EU chemicals directive agreed|work=|publisher=[[RTÉ News]]|date=[[2006-12-01]]|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2006/1201/reach.html|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-08-15}}</ref> Earlier in 2006, an [[2006 Côte d'Ivoire toxic waste spill|toxic waste spill off the coast of Côte d'Ivoire]], from a European ship, prompted the Commission to look into legislation against toxic waste. With states such as Spain now even having a crime against shipping toxic waste, the Commission proposed to create criminal sentences for "ecological crimes". Although the Commission's right to propose criminal law was contested, it won the right in the Court of Justice.<ref name="E!Sharp0507 Legal">{{cite news|last=Charter|first=David|coauthors=|title=A new legal environment|work=E!Sharp|pages=23-5|language=English|publisher=People Power Process|date=2007|url=|accessdate=}}</ref>

The EU was involved in the development of the [[Kyoto protocol]] and signed up to it along side its member states. One way it has sought to tackle climate change was by creating the [[European Union Emissions Trading Scheme|Emissions Trading Scheme]], the worlds biggest multinational environmental trading scheme. The EU is also involved in trying to secure a post-Kyoto deal.<ref name="BBC Dimas"/> In 2007, the EU agreed to an energy policy binding members to cut their [[carbon dioxide]] [[Greenhouse gas|emissions]] by at least 20% from [[1990]] levels, by [[2020]]. If an international deal is reached, emissions would be cut further. The use of [[Renewable energy in the European Union|renewable energy in the EU]] would also be increased to 20%.<ref name="EUO energy">{{cite web|last=Rettman|first=Andrew|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=EU sticks out neck in global climate change battle|work=|publisher=EU Observer|date=[[2007-03-09]]|url=http://euobserver.com/9/23665|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-03-09}}</ref> It is also planned that by 2020, 10% of all automobiles would run on biofuels.<ref name="Discovery energy">{{cite web|last=Ames|first=Paul|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Poland ends stand-off with EU over road plans|work=|publisher=[[Discovery Channel]]|date=[[2007-07-31]]|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/640968f2-3f5b-11dc-b034-0000779fd2ac.html|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-08-15}}</ref>
