'''''Yakuza eiga''''', or '''yakuza films''', is a popular [[film genre]] in [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese cinema]] which focuses on the lives and dealings of ''[[yakuza]]'', also referred to as the [[Japan|Japanese]] [[Mafia]]. 

==Ninkyo eiga==
''Ninkyo eiga'', or "chivalry films", were the first type of yakuza films. Most were produced by the [[Toei]] studio in the 1960s. The [[kimono]]-clad yakuza hero of the ninkyo films (personified by the stoic [[Ken Takakura]]) was always portrayed as an honorable outlaw torn between the contradictory values of ''giri'' (duty) and ''ninjo'' (personal feelings).

==Jitsuroku eiga==
In the 1970s, a new breed of yakuza eiga emerged, the ''jitsuroku eiga'', or "true document film". Many jitsuroku eiga were based on true stories, and filmed in a documentary style. This genre was popularized by [[Kinji Fukasaku]]'s groundbreaking yakuza epic ''[[Battles Without Honor and Humanity]]''. This film, which spawned four sequels, portrayed the post-[[Pacific War|War]] yakuza not as the honorable heirs to the samurai code, but as ruthless, treacherous street thugs. The films star [[Bunta Sugawara]] (often thought of as the anti-Ken Takakura) as a sneering ex-soldier who rises to power in the bombed-out [[Hiroshima]] underworld.

==Recent developments==
In the 1990s, yakuza movies in Japan declined. Now, many are low-budget direct-to-video movies. One exception has been the critically acclaimed films of [[Takeshi Kitano]], whose [[existentialism|existential]] yakuza movies are well known around the world.
