'''''SpongeBob SquarePants''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[Animation|animated]] [[Television program|television series]] and [[media franchise]]. It is one of Nickelodeon's "[[Nicktoons]]." 

Although its original network is [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]], SpongeBob is now broadcast across the world (see [[International Following of SpongeBob SquarePants|International Following]] for more details). It was created by marine biologist and animator [[Stephen Hillenburg]] and is produced through his production company, [[United Plankton Pictures]] Inc. The series is set in the [[Pacific Ocean]], in the city of [[Bikini Bottom]] and the surrounding lagoon floor. The [[pilot episode]] first aired in the United States on Nickelodeon after the ''[[Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards]]'' on [[May 1]], [[1999]]. The "official" series premiere followed on [[July 24]], [[1999]] with the second episode, "[[Bubblestand]]/[[Ripped Pants]]."

==Setting==
{{main|Bikini Bottom}}
[[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob SquarePants]] is a [[sponge (product)|sponge]] who lives in a Pineapple, while his [[octopus]]<ref>Movie DVD Behind the scenes feature with Stephen Hillenburg explains that Squidward is an octopus.</ref> neighbor [[Squidward Tentacles]] lives in a [[moai]] head. SpongeBob's other neighbor and best friend (on the other side of Squidward), is a pink starfish named [[Patrick]] , who lives under a rock. Squidward always gets annoyed when [[SpongeBob]] and [[Patrick]] bother him.

SpongeBob's house-pet is a [[snail]] named [[Gary]], whose "meow" is similar to a cat. Although Gary only speaks in a few episodes, the characters have shown an ability to understand him. In addition to this, underwater worms bark exactly like dogs, and are kept on chains. Jellyfish are the equivalent of Bees; buzzing, stinging with poison although appears to be an electric shock, and producing delicious "jelly", mocking the name "jellyfish", while still referencing a bee's honey. Fish act as the citizens of the community but, as a rule, are not important characters.

SpongeBob works as a fry cook at the [[Krusty Krab]], a [[hamburger]] [[fast-food restaurant]], with Squidward Tentacles who is the cashier. The [[Krusty Krab]] is owned by Eugene Krabs, also known as Mr. Krabs.
[[Sheldon J. Plankton]] (commonly referred to as "[[Plankton]]") is Mr. Krabs' arch enemy who owns a low-rank fast-food restaurant called [[The Chum Bucket]] across the street which has never had a customer, and he spends most of his time plotting to steal the recipe for Mr. Krabs's popular [[Krabby Patty]] burgers. Only in the movie does he succeed; the formula is never actually revealed to the audience. 
Plankton's computer wife, Karen, alternately helps him in his schemes or bickers with him.

[[Sandy Cheeks]] is another friend of SpongeBob. She is a squirrel that lives in an underwater dome in Bikini Bottom. She was sent there by her bosses, chimpanzees. Sandy has a [[Texas|Texan]] accent and is from the state itself. When not inside her tree-dome, she wears an Astronaut Suit.

Instead of cars, the residents of [[Bikini Bottom]] drive [[boats]]. Once, while out in the wilderness, [[Patrick starfish|Patrick]] questions how they could have a camp fire on the lagoon bottom; the fire is immediately extinguished with a sizzle. A flurry of bubbles accompanies actions in many of the episodes, just to remind the viewer that everything is underwater. Ironically, when there is a body of water underwater a non-car boat must be used to cross it, because both SpongeBob and Patrick cannot swim.

==Popularity==
SpongeBob is the only cartoon to consistently make the Top 10 list in the [[Nielsen ratings]], and is the first "low budget" [[Nicktoon|Nickelodeon cartoon]], according to the network, to become extremely popular. Low-budget cartoons had not garnered as much esteem as higher-rated (and higher-budgeted) shows, such as ''[[Rugrats]]'', although when SpongeBob aired in 1999, it had gained a significant enough viewers in the ratings to be considered popular, eventually becoming more popular than ''Rugrats'' had ever been. SpongeBob follows other [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] shows that have attracted "older" followers: ''[[The Ren & Stimpy Show]]'', ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', the ''[[Kablam!]]'' skits, ''[[Action League Now!]]'' and ''[[The Angry Beavers]]''. Other shows have followed in this trend as well: ''[[Invader Zim]]'' and ''[[The Fairly OddParents]]'' won a similar fan base when they aired in 2001, and the latter is now second only to SpongeBob in popularity,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allgame.com/cg/agg.dll?p=agg&sql=1:43920|title=www.allgame.com/cg/agg.dll?p=agg&sql=1:43920<!--INSERT TITLE-->|accessdate=2007-01-22}}</ref> while the former attracted a cult following. The show debuted in 1999, and during that time, [[Pokémon]] was still the biggest craze. SpongeBob did not gain its popularity until around 2000, and it has remained popular since then. Its popularity is probably caused by its unique setting under water, which few other cartoons do. 

===Broad appeal=== 
{{OR}}
Its popularity could also be due to its sophisticate and sometimes adult humour, which many fail to appreciate and again, other cartoons lack. The cartoon is designed to appeal to adults as well as children. This has a lot to do with the absurd way underwater life and situations are represented, and with the situations, references, and words used, which younger viewers might not understand. Certain innuendos also are intended to go over younger viewers' heads. For example, SpongeBob tried to show his grandma that he was a mature adult by wearing sideburns and a [[Bowler hat|derby]], and listening to 'free form jazz', jokes most children would not understand. Numerous [[marine biology]] in-jokes are woven into the show. There are often complex ironic scenarios that need close attention. Such as the episode "paper", Squidward throws away a piece of paper useless to him, Spongebob then reclaims the paper and considering it very valuable, insists on giving it back. Squidward refuses it, and Spongebob begins to play with it having great fun, making Squidward jealous. Craving the paper, although he earlier rejected it, he traded all of his possessions for it, later realizing what he had done. This makes Spongebob look as if he has done wrong when actually he was sensible at first as to treat as a valuable material, when Squidward, who comes across as much more mature, was being naive in assuming that it could not be used for anything. 

SpongeBob is one cartoon in a long line of shows to put in more "adult" references, and has become so popular with teenagers and adults that the series was broadcasted on [[MTV]] and featured on [[Spike TV]]. A quote by [[Patrick Star|Patrick]] ("It's gonna rock!" from the episode [[Mid-Life Crustacean]]) has been used as a promotional tag-line for rock stations. [[Ren and Stimpy]], among others, had followed a similar path. ''[[The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie]]'', released on [[November 19]] [[2004]], features a [[cameo]] appearance by [[actor]] [[David Hasselhoff]], in a parody of his role from the [[Baywatch]] TV series. In the episode [[Krab Borg]], SpongeBob makes notice of Mr. Krabs calling his radio player his "little buddy", with an accent similar to that of [[Tony Montana]], the main character of the movie [[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]. Also, in the episode [[Bummer Vacation]], Squidward calls for a "shell on a shingle", referencing a [[shit on a shingle]].

Part of the show's appeal has to do with the childlike nature of SpongeBob and his best friend, Patrick Star, both of whom are adults but display an innocence typical of human children. However, the characters are not immune from more adult avocations, including rock musicianship in a stadium performance, reminiscent of a hard rock concert. And Patrick turning to Spongebob after they had nurtured a baby clam, holding his arms out saying "Lets have another". Spongebob is disturbed.

While many newer cartoons revolve around pre-adolescents with strange lives and feature many pop-culture references (e.g. ''[[The Fairly Oddparents]]''), SpongeBob chooses to go for a more teen/adult friendly formula that was used in highly successful older Nick cartoons such as ''[[Ren and Stimpy]]'' and ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', non-human young adults in crazy, unrealistic situations, with minimal pop culture references. 

Unlike the Nickelodeon network, SpongeBob features well-known independent musicians who contribute to its soundtrack. [[Alternative rock]] bands such as [[Wilco]], [[The Shins]], [[The Flaming Lips]] and [[Ween]] (who have contributed two original songs to the show and their 1997 song "Ocean Man" to the movie soundtrack), as well as metal bands [[Pantera]], [[Motörhead]] and [[Twisted Sister]] have made appearances on the show and movies soundtracks, and [[heavy metal]] group [[Metallica]] even released a T-shirt featuring cartoon versions of themselves playing live with the characters SpongeBob and Patrick. [[United Kingdom|British]] rock singer legend [[David Bowie]] announced that he will be a special guest on a future episode of SpongeBob SquarePants in [[2009]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/entertainment/stories.nsf/peopleinthenews/story/87ECF7AD42EF0

===Merchandising and Marketing=== 
[[Image:Lego_Spongebob_2006_sets.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[LEGO SpongeBob SquarePants]]]] 
Merchandise based on the show ranges from [[Kraft Dinner|Kraft Macaroni & Cheese]] and Kraft SuperMac & Cheese, [[Kellogg's]] cereal, and video games to [[boxer shorts]], thongs, pajamas and t-shirts. A line of SpongeBob SquarePants was even produced. The show also spawned a large and popular merchandise line at [[Hot Topic]], [[Claire's]], [[RadioShack]], [[Target Stores|Target]], [[Wal-Mart]] and [[Toys "R" Us]] stores. There have been kids meal tie-ins at [[Wendy's Restaurant|Wendy's]] for SpongeBob's House Party Special in 2002 and at [[Burger King]] restaurants in 2001, 2003, and for the movie in 2004. In 2006, another kids meal tie-in for Burger King was introduced for the Lost in Time special. SpongeBob was also featured on [[VH1]]'s ''[[I Love the 90s: Part Deux]]: 1999'' as part of a commentary by [[Michael Ian Black]]. A tie-in beverage for [[7-Eleven]] convenience stores has been created, a pineapple-flavored [[Slurpee]]. 

Events in the past with the SpongeBob SquarePants theme include an exhibit at [[Underwater Adventures Aquarium]] in the [[Mall of America]] called SeaCrits of Bikini Bottom during the summer of 2003. In October 2004, a [[NASCAR]] [[Busch Series]] race was named The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie 300, presented by [[Lowe's]] and broadcast on [[Turner Network Television|TNT]] featuring [[Jimmie Johnson]]'s #48 Lowe's stock car and [[Kyle Busch]]'s #5 stock car painted for the race with the SpongeBob Movie paint schemes. There were contests tied in with the movie where fans could win SpongeBob-related items or a trip to the [[Cayman Islands]]. The motion simulator/interactive movie ride "Escape from Dino-Island 3D" at [[Six Flags Over Texas]] was turned into "[[SpongeBob SquarePants 4-D]]", with water squirts, real bubbles, and other sensory enhancements. [[LEGO]] received license to produce SpongeBob SquarePants building sets, beginning to sell them in May 2006. 

Other items featuring SpongeBob include a special edition [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] [[board game]] and [[The Game of Life|Life]] board game as well as a SpongeBob SquarePants edition of [[Ants in the Pants]] and [[Yahtzee]]. [[SEGA]] Corporation introduced a ticket [[redemption game]] based on the show that has become popular with most [[video arcades]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.segaarcade.com/pr/SpongeBob.asp|title=www.segaarcade.com/pr/SpongeBob.asp<!--INSERT TITLE-->|accessdate=2007-01-22}}</ref>
The SpongeBob SquarePants market saturation has become something of a joke. In the comic strip "Sherman's Lagoon", Hawthorne the crab is showing off a small nuclear (Junior) reactor, and Herman the shark says "Boy, that SpongeBob will endorse anything!"

When the complete first season of SpongeBob SquarePants was released in the United Kingdom, it included some heavy editing (though not to the cartoons themselves). The audio commentaries were cut out, and only two extras were left in, possibly to avoid a 12 rating. A similar approach was taken with the second season; it included no audio commentaries and only one extra, Around the World with SpongeBob Squarepants.

==History==
===Development (1993&ndash;1999)===
<!--[[Image:TeaattheTreedome.gif| left|thumb|150px|SpongeBob meets Sandy ([[Tea at the Treedome]])]]-->
''SpongeBob's'' history can be traced back to 1993 when ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'' first aired. One of the producers was [[Stephen Hillenburg]], a cartoon worker/marine biologist who loved both his careers. When ''Rocko's Modern Life'' was cancelled in 1996, Hillenburg began working on ''SpongeBob'' (although sketches trace back to 1987). He teamed up with creative director [[Derek Drymon]], who had worked on shows such as ''[[Doug]]'', ''[[Action League Now!]]'', and ''[[Hey Arnold!]]''. Drymon had worked with Hillenburg on ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'' as well, as did many SpongeBob crew members, including writer-directors Sherm Cohen and [[Dan Povenmire]], writer [[Tim Hill]], [[voice actor]]s [[Tom Kenny]] and [[Doug Lawrence]] (aka "Mr. Lawrence"), actor-writer [[Martin Olson]] and animation director Alan Smart. Another crew member with previous [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] cartoon experience was former ''Angry Beavers'' story editor [[Merriwether Williams]], who worked on that show for its first few seasons and switched to ''SpongeBob'' in July 1999.

During production of the show, Bobson provided a concept of short comics with the same style of the show, but the characters looked different. ''SpongeBob'' used to be named ''SpongeBoy'',<ref>"SpongeBob Exposed! The Insiders Guide to SpongeBob SquarePants" book</ref> and used to wear a red hat with a green base and a white business shirt with a tie. The name "[[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBoy]]" did not make it into the show since the name was already officially trademarked by [[Bob Burden]], creator of ''[[Flaming Carrot]]''. Hillenburg later chose the alternative name "SpongeBob". The original name was once referenced in the show by Mr. Krabs' line, "SpongeBoy, me Bob!." The Krusty Krab was originally spelled with the letter C rather than K, but Stephen Hillenburg thought Ks were funnier and it would fit his [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] heritage.

''SpongeBob'' aired its first episode, "Help Wanted/Reef Blower/Tea at the Treedome", after the 1999 ''[[Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards]]''. At this time, ''[[Rugrats]]'' was the most popular show on Nickelodeon and had already outlived dozens of other lower-budget cartoons. SpongeBob, with its generally lower-class animation and humor style more rooted in clever word-play and culture-references unlike the [[toilet humor|potty humor]] that made ''Rugrats'' so popular, was expected to be just another one of those shows. Following early struggles, its ratings soared, and a year after release, it surpassed ''Rugrats'' as Nickelodeon's highest rated show. ''SpongeBob''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s signature voice (provided by [[Tom Kenny]]) and humorous style was enjoyable to both younger and older audiences.

===Peak years (2000&ndash;2003)===
The first part of 2002 saw SpongeBob at its peak. The beginning of the third season produced many of classic episodes and focused on the same style and animation concepts. 

Unfortunately things changed late in the year. Due to rumors of a movie, there was high speculation that the show would be canceled and that 2003/2004 would feature the last season of new episodes. Fans were devastated and online petitions were widely distributed to convince Nickelodeon to produce more episodes by showing continuing fan support. "SpongeBob Meets The Strangler/Pranks A Lot" was the last episode of this season, and aired in October 2004. It was also released on DVD at the end of 2003. Following this, the movie was released in November of that year.

[[Image:Spongebob Squarepants Movie poster.jpg|right|thumb|170px|''[[The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie]]'' poster.]]

===Hiatus and movie era (2003&ndash;2005)===
A hiatus from 2003 to 2005 challenged viewer loyalty, as only about 7 new episodes were shown while the previous two-year span, from 2003-2004, aired 20. This led to the program's lowest ratings ever, causing speculation that the show might even be cancelled after the feature's release.

''[[The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie]]'' achieved over $85,000,000 in revenue in the United States, considered to be under-expectations: People assumed that the show's popularity showed something of a decline at the time of its release. ''[[The Rugrats Movie]]'', on the other hand, earned $100,494,685 in the United States. It was around this time that the animated series which it is based on, ''[[Rugrats]]'', was at the height of its popularity. Interestingly, that movie would also be considered ''Rugrats''' [[jump the shark]] moment by fans, while the ''SpongeBob'' movie was actually generally well received by fans who saw it.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

It was announced late in 2004 that SpongeBob would be continuing with a new session due in 2005. Hillenburg, despite the rumors, did not actually leave the show but has resigned from his position as the show's executive producer (this job now belongs to [[Derek Drymon]], with [[Paul Tibbitt]] taking over Drymon's job as creative director).

===Comeback (2005-Present)===
[[Image:Fear of a Krabby Patty.jpg|160px|left|thumb|The ''[[Fear of a Krabby Patty]]'' DVD.]]

TV advertisements for ''SpongeBob'''s fourth season first aired publicly during the 2005 ''[[Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards]]''. The new episodes began airing on [[May 6]], [[2005]]. The first new episode of Season 4 was "[[Fear of a Krabby Patty]]"/"[[Shell of a Man]]". After airing three new episodes on Fridays from [[May 6]]-[[May 20]], Nickelodeon showed no new episodes until September 2005. 

For the first time in the series' run, Nickelodeon began airing 11-minute segments of new episodes separately, spread over two weeks. This practice began with the airing of the episode "[[Selling Out (SpongeBob SquarePants)|Selling Out]]" on [[September 23]]; its companion episode, "[[Funny Pants]]," premiered the following week.

The Star Online eCentral reported in December 2005 that Nickelodeon had ordered 20 more episodes, bringing the show’s total to 100.<sup><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.star-ecentral.com/news/story.asp?file=/2005/12/27/tvnradio/12578379&sec=tvnradio|title=www.star-ecentral.com/news/story.asp?file=/2005/12/27/tvnradio/12578379&sec=tvnradio<!--INSERT TITLE-->|accessdate=2007-01-22}}</ref></sup> 

''Spongebob SquarePants'' has been approved for a sixth season, which consists of thirteen episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-mightybamypoehlerspongebobsixthseason,0,6061089.story?coll=zap-news-headlines|title=www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-mightybamypoehlerspongebobsixthseason,0,6061089.story?coll=zap-news-headlines<!--INSERT TITLE-->|accessdate=2007-02-23}}</ref>

In November 2005, Nickelodeon aired the special "[[Have You Seen This Snail?]]" and did not air new episodes until February 2006, when they showed the special "[[Dunces and Dragons]]". The show was sponsored by [[Burger King]], and got 8.5 million viewers, one of the highest in ''SpongeBob'''s history. They then showed new episodes until [[June 2]] [[2006]]. On [[September 23]], [[2006]] Nickelodeon began to air new episodes, which included "[[New Leaf]]", "[[Once Bitten]]" in September. ''SpongeBob'' also aired 2 October episodes and the November episodes include "[[The Best Day Ever]]", which featured a 24-hour marathon before its premiere. This drew 6.7 million viewers on [[November 9]] along with "[[Wigstruck]]" (Originally [[October 20]]) and "[[That's No Lady]]," which aired late the same month. The new episodes in 2007 started airing on [[January 15]] and, one of the first times in SpongeBob history, aired three new episodes back to back on [[February 19]], [[2007]]. It's announced in February 2007 that KISS rocker [[Gene Simmons]] will be voicing the Sea Monster in a new episode called "20,000 Patties Under The Sea", schedule to air in 2007.

{{main|Music of SpongeBob SquarePants}}

*The ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' [[theme music|theme song]] is primarily based on the [[sea shanty]], "Blow the Man Down". It is sung by Painty the Pirate, voiced by Pat Pinney, and can be found on the soundtrack ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants: Original Theme Highlights]]''. This song is popularly misattributed to [["Weird Al" Yankovic]]. A cover of the song by [[Avril Lavigne]] can be found on [[The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie (soundtrack)]]. Another cover by the [[Violent Femmes]], which aired as a commercial on Nickelodeon to promote Season 2, can be viewed in the special features of the [[List of SpongeBob SquarePants Media|Nautical Nonsense/Sponge Buddies DVD]]. A choral version was recorded for the SpongeBob [[Christmas special]] where the last repetition of "SpongeBob SquarePants" was replaced by, "It's the SpongeBob Christmas special." The theme song is occasionally utilized as marching cadence.
*Traditional [[sea shanty|sea shanties]] are used for the musical themes in the show. Most commonly used is that of "[[Drunken Sailor]]". In the episode "Krusty Krab Training Video," a young Eugene Krabs is shown walking to a soda vending machine, la-laing the shanty "Blow the Man Down."

Ironically, one of Spence's more famous songs for the NFL Films library of music is an orchestral version of "Drunken Sailor" called "Up She Rises", first suggested by [[Steven Sabol]] to his father [[Ed Sabol|Ed]] because he liked the song at summer camp.
*In the episode "Prehibernation Week," the music is played by the [[heavy metal]] band [[Pantera]]. When ever SpongeBob does something dangerous, the music starts playing. The opening credits have a shot that read's "Special musical guests [[Pantera]]".
