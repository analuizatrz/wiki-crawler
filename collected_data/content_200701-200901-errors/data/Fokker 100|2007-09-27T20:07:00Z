The '''Fokker 100''' is a medium size twin-[[turbofan]] [[airliner]] from the [[Fokker]] company.

Low operational costs and almost no competition in the 100-seat short-range class made it a best seller when it was introduced in the late 1980s, but improved models of the [[Boeing 737]] and [[Airbus A320|Airbus A319]] affected sales and Fokker became insolvent. Production ended in 1997 with 283 airframes delivered. In August [[2006]], 229 Fokker 100 aircraft remained in airline service with 47 airlines around the world.<ref name="FI">''[[Flight International]]'', 3-9 October 2006.</ref>

==History==
The Fokker 100 design was announced in 1983 as an updated replacement for Fokker's popular, but superseded [[Fokker F28|F28]] ''Fellowship'' design. Although the majority of the parts between the two aircraft are different, the Fokker 100 was certificated by the United States Federal Aviation Administration as the Fokker 28-0100.  The most noticeable difference was the much longer fuselage, which increased seating by 65% from 65 in the original F28 series to 107 in a three-by-two single-class arrangement. Fokker also introduced a redesigned wing for the 100, which they claimed was 30% more efficient in cruise. The engines were upgraded to the modern [[Rolls-Royce Tay (turbofan)|Rolls-Royce Tay]] [[turbofan]]s, while the cockpit was updated with an [[glass cockpit|all-glass instrumentation]] package. The Fokker 100 features twin fuselage-mounted engines and a [[T-tail]], similar to that of the [[Douglas DC-9]] family. The Fokker 100 also does not have eyebrow windows above the main cockpit windows as is present in the Fokker 28.

Two prototypes were built - the first, PH-MKH, flew for the first time on [[November 30]], [[1986]], and the second, PH-MKC, followed on [[February 25]], [[1987]]. The type certificate was awarded in November 1987. The first deliveries of the TAY620-15 powered versions started to [[Swissair]] in February 1988. [[American Airlines]] (75 planes ordered), [[TAM Linhas Aéreas]] (50 planes) and [[US Air]] (40 planes) were major customers of the Fokker 100 and were powered by the more powerful TAY650-15.

By 1991, Fokker had produced 70 units and had orders for a total of more than 230. An extended range version with additional fuel tanks in the wings was introduced in 1993, and a quick-change passenger/freighter version in 1994, the 100QC. A shorter version was introduced in 1993 as a direct replacement for the earlier [[Fokker F28|F28]], known as the [[Fokker 70]], which removed 4.70 m of the fuselage and reduced seating to 80. Studies on the 130 seat '''F130''' and the '''Fokker 100QC''' (freighter) did not reach further stages of development. A '''Fokker 100EJ''' (Executive Jet) has been introduced in 2003 as a conversion from used Fokker 100 aircraft.

Although the design was a success in the marketplace, Fokker continued to lose massive amounts of money due to mismanagement. Eventually their parent company, [[Daimler Benz Aerospace]], shut them down. Fokker collapsed in 1996 and wound up production in early 1997. There had been some discussion about the company being purchased by [[Bombardier]], but the plans fell through. 

An [[Amsterdam]]-based group, '''Rekkof Restart''' (Rekkof is Fokker spelled backwards) negotiated to re-open the [[Fokker 70]] and 100 lines in 1999, but the deal never completed.  Stork NV acquired the maintenance business for the aircraft and operated it under the name "Fokker Aviation". <ref name=FokkerHistory> [http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/NV-Koninklijke-Nederlandse-Vliegtuigenfabriek-Fokker-Company-History.html History of Fokker]</ref> 

Like any number of designs, the 70/100 was being increasingly squeezed from below by stretched versions of the Bombardier and Embraer [[regional jet]]s, which also killed off plans for the Fairchild 728JET/928JET and an unnamed design from [[ATR]].  A proposed stretch version called the Fokker 130 was never built. <ref name=FokkerHistory />

*On [[5 March]] [[1993]], a [[Palair Macedonian Airlines]] Fokker 100 crashed near [[Skopje]],  [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], in climb, due to icing. Four of the six crew and 77 of the 91 passengers were killed.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}
*In [[1996]], a problem in a [[Reverse thrust|thrust reverser]] caused [[TAM Linhas Aéreas Flight 402|TAM Flight 402]] to crash in [[São Paulo]] shortly after take-off, killing 95 and 4 on the ground. Since the thrust reverser warning light was rendered inoperative, the crew had no idea what had failed and how to solve the problem until they crashed.
*In July 9, 1997, an explosive structural failure fatally blew part of the floor, a bench and a passenger out of a [[TAM Linhas Aéreas|TAM]] Fokker 100 during flight.
*In September 18, 2001, two cabin windows shattered on a TAM Fokker 100 due to an engine breakup, and the depressurization killed one of the 82 passengers on board.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}
*On August 31, 2002, another TAM Fokker 100 force-landed at a farm near [[Araçatuba]] after running out of fuel. The gear-down landing's only victim was a cow on the ground. No passengers were injured. On the same day, another Fokker 100 made an emergency gear-up landing at [[Viracopos-Campinas International Airport|Viracopos Airport]]. Shortly after the incidents of August 31, TAM announced its intention to immediately reduce its fleet of Fokker 100 and phase out the type completely within three years.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}{{dubious}}As of September 27, 2007, TAM was still flying Fokker 100s.
*On 25 January 2005 about 11 pm a [[Montenegro Airlines]] Fokker 100 (YU-AOM) jet ran off the side of the runway during a night landing in snowy conditions at [[Podgorica]]. The nosegear collapsed and the airplane skidded for about 700 metres before coming to rest, 1180 m after touchdown. Two passengers, pilot and co-pilot were injured.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}
*On August 8, 2006, a front door of a TAM flight came off a few minutes after takeoff at the [[Congonhas-São Paulo International Airport|Congonhas/São Paulo International Airport]], in [[São Paulo (city)|São Paulo]], [[Brazil]].  The cabin had not yet been pressurized and the pilot was able to land back at Congonhas.  The door fell approximately 450 meters (1,470 feet) onto the roof of a supermarket, causing no major damage.
*On January 25, 2007, a [[Régional|Régional Compagnie Aérienne Européenne]] Fokker 100 (F-GMPG) overran the runway on an aborted takeoff. No evidence of bird strike or engine malfunction was found. The pilot did not ask for deicing before taking-off. One person killed on the ground as the aircraft hit a truck.
