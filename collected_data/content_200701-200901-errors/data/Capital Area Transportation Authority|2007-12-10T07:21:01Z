The '''Capital Area Transportation Authority (CATA)''' provides mass transit bus service and [[paratransit]] within the metro [[Lansing, Michigan]] area  (the Michigan capital) including [[Michigan State University]].

==CATA system==
CATA operates both bus transit and paratransit service across a 600-square-mile area throughout metro [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]] including [[Michigan State University]].   CATA boasts the second highest ridership in the state of [[Michigan]], with a total ridership of 9,351,227 in 2005 and 10,031,082 in 2006.

CATA has approximately 300 employees.  It does not operate on these seven major holidays:
*New Years Day
*Easter
*Memorial Day
*Fourth of July
*Labor Day
*Thanksgiving
*Christmas

===Bus service===
[[Image:cata hybrid.jpg|right|300px|thumb|A 40-foot [[hybrid electric]] CATA bus, [[New Flyer]] DE40LFR.]]
Referred to as "fixed route service", CATA's standard bus service operates on thirty-three routes with both rigid 40 ft. and [[Articulated bus|articulated]] 60 ft. buses.  Most of these are [[low floor]] buses manufactured by [[New Flyer]], however a few older high floor [[General Motors|GM]] [[Rapid Transit Series]] remain in the fleet.  The bus service hub is at the CATA Transportation Center (CTC) in downtown Lansing, with a satellite hub on the MSU campus (see below).  In August of 2006, CATA added the first three [[hybrid electric]] buses to its fleet (New Flyer DE40LFR); making CATA the first company in Michigan to operate hybrid buses.  Since then it has continued to purchase more, including articulated hybrid models.

Fixed route buses use a GPS-based system manufactured by Luminator USA that periodically plays a voice-recording of the bus's location over the loudspeakers.  This is particularly useful to the visually-impaired and users who are unfamiliar with the area.  All buses are also equipped with fold-out ramps for users in wheelchairs.

CATA operates a satellite hub, called the MSU/CATA Transportation Center, on the [[Michigan State University]] campus.  This center serves as a hub for CATA's MSU-based routes; it also consists of a large public [[parking ramp]].  Many of the MSU-area routes are called "Spartan Service" - this means that the route only operates during the MSU fall and spring semesters.  This includes all routes numbered 30-36, Lot Link and Night Owl.  Other routes (routes #1, 25 and 26)  are partially Spartan Service, that is, they run more frequently and/or longer into the night during the semesters.

CATA significantly altered its intra-campus (routes 30-39) Spartan Service bus routes serving Michigan State University beginning Fall 2007. Changes include having the same bus serve both the Commuter Lot and Spartan Village, adding Spartan Service to the newly re-opened University Village Apartments, extending fixed route weekend and weeknight service to the Commuter Lot, and adding an additional fixed route for weekend and weeknight service; in the process, routes 37 and 38, the previous night/weekend routes, have been eliminated and replaced with the new routes 34-36 for weekday night and weekend service on campus.  The weekday daytime routes, 30-33, were considerably altered as well. These changes are in effect due to major construction on Farm Ln., which is being rebuilt for widening and to bypass the frequently-served train tracks.  The construction project will not be completed for several years.

===Paratransit===
[[Image:CATA paratransit.jpg|thumb|250px|A CATA paratransit bus in Old Town Lansing.]]
CATA operates several paratransit services using small buses and mini vans.  One service, Spec-Tran, is offered to persons with disabilities who are unable to use fixed route service. The "Night Owl", offers rides across the MSU campus every night from 2 am to 7 am (9 am on weekends) in order to give students a safer way to traverse campus at these hours.

==Fixed routes==
;Route categories:
* Routes 1-19 are Lansing area routes
* Routes 20-26 are east area routes (East Lansing, Okemos, Haslett)
* Routes 30-36 are MSU area routes and all are entirely Spartan Service (i.e. they only run during MSU fall and spring semesters - these are marked "Entire route" under the "Spartan Service" column)
* Routes 46 & 48 are limited stop commuter routes
* "''(Limited)''" indicates that the route only stops at certain points
* "''(Trolley)''" indicates that the route is run using trolley-style buses.  Bicycles cannot be brought on this route.
* All CATA bus routes are wheelchair accessible {{access icon|16px}}.
