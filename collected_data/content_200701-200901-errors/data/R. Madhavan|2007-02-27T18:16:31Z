Madhavan's breakout role as a leading actor came two years later after his film career began  with 2000's ''[[Alaipayuthey]]'' by director, [[Mani Ratnam]], which he became a ''pin-up'' boy after his performance as ''Karthik''. The film, gave him a solid foundation to build his career and several other films he has starred in, have become blockbusters in [[South India]], due to this he also built up a prominent market for his films in [[Bollywood]] and in overseas markets. 

As a seasoned actor, Madhavan began to take on more varied roles and projects, including another Mani Ratnam film, ''[[Aayitha Ezhuthu]]'' where he portrayed the gangster, ''Inba''. While filming for ''[[Ramji Londonwale]]'', he caught the eye of UTV, and became a game host in, ''[[Deal Ya No Deal]]'', but it only lasted for one series. R. Madhavan is a prominent figure in India's entertainment business.

==Film career==

==== 1997 - 2003 ====
Madhavan was a popular face on Indian television even before he made his maiden film debut. He had acted in [[Hindi]] television serials like ''Saaya'', ''Sea Hawks'', ''Banegi Apni Baat'', and ''Ghar Jamai'' in minor and brief roles<ref name="SER">{{cite news|url=http://tvguide.indiatimes.com/articlelist/246503.cms
|publisher=Unplugged TV Guide|title= I have always broken the Rules:Madhavan|date=Oct 18, 2006
}}</ref>. Director [[Santosh Sivan]] saw him during the shoot of an advertisment commercial for ''Ponds Soap''  and took some photographs of him which he handed to the famous director [[Mani Ratnam]].
In 1997, following Santosh Sivan's request, Madhavan then auditioned for a part in the critically-acclaimed movie, ''[[Iruvar]]''<ref name="MNU">{{cite news|url=http://www.rediff.com/entertai/2000/mar/08madh.htm
|publisher=Rediff|title= People remember Scenes, not episodes|date=Oct 18, 2006
}}</ref> starring [[Mohanlal]], [[Prakash Raj]]  and [[Aishwarya Rai]] and directed by [[Mani Ratnam]]. Mani Ratnam was pleased with Madhavan's capabilities but wanted a senior actor to play Madhavan's part, so Mani Ratnam confirmed Madhavan could be a part of his next project as a sorry plea.  

In late 1997, Madhavan made his debut in films, with a small role as an Indian Inspector in the [[Hollywood]] film ''[[Inferno (1997 film)|Inferno]]'' co-starring [[Don "The Dragon" Wilson]]. His debut in Indian movies came in the form of ''[[Relax (film)|Shanti Shanti Shanti]]'', a [[Kannada]]-language movie co-starring [[Abbas (actor)|Abbas]] and [[Prakash Raj]]. The film performed well at the Kannada box-office but when it was dubbed into Tamil after Madhavan's Tamil debut it lowered Madhavan's status in the [[tamil film]] industry after [[Alaipayuthey]].

He got his first big break when [[Mani Ratnam]] called him up again, for his next project. He  introduced Madhavan to [[Kollywood|Tamil Cinema]] through the film ''[[Alaipayuthey]]''. Produced by [[Madras Talkies]], it told the tale of the intricate relationships after marriage and the problems that occur along the way. He was paired with [[Shalini Kumar]], an experienced actress, for the film. The film grossed over Rs.50 million at the box office and became Madhavan's first blockbuster project. Madhavan went on a signing-spree for various films due to his new found fame status.

His next highly-anticipated film, ''[[Ennavale]]'' starring [[Sneha]] dwelled on the subject of diasability flopped but [[Gautham Menon]]'s debut venture, ''[[Minnale]]'' became his second surprise blockbuster. ''[[Minnale]]'' explored the views of college enemies vying for a love after a decade without contact. The film grossed over Rs.75 million at the box office. The music also was a huge success rendered by debutant, [[Harris Jayaraj]]. [[Gautham Menon]] and Madhavan then remade this in [[Bollywood]] as ''[[Rehna Hai Tere Dil Mein]]'' with [[Diya Mirza]] and [[Saif Ali Khan]], which however despite gaining profits from the music sale of the film, did not do well at the box-office.
[[Image:Anbesivam.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Kamal Haasan]] and Madhavan as depicted in the film, ''[[Anbe Sivam]]'']]
[[Madras Talkies]]'s next production was the comedy, ''[[Dumm Dumm Dumm]]'' became another landmark film in his career, in which he co-starred with [[Jyothika Saravanan]] was then followed by veteran director [[K. Balachandar]]'s 100th film, ''[[Parthale Paravasam]]'' with [[Simran (actress)|Simran Bagga]] and [[Sneha]]. Despite a big opening and high expectations, it only managed reasonable business at the box-office. However his third blockbuster ''[[Run (film)|Run]]'' was a landmark film for Madhavan as it won him ''Filmfare Best Actor Award South'' in the [[Filmfare Awards South]] ceremony. ''Run'', directed by Linguswamy told the simple story of a brother opposing his sister's love but the screenplay and thte telling of the story was slick and was well appreciated. The film grossed over Rs.75 million at the box office and the Kollywood trade began comparing Madhavan with top established actors in [[Kollywood]]  like [[Ajith Kumar]] and [[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]].

The film was remade in Hindi which starred [[Abhishek Bachchan]] and [[Bhumika Chawla]] in the roles of Madhavan and [[Meera Jasmine]], who debuted in the original. [[Mani Ratnam]] chose Madhavan again with [[Simran (actress)|Simran Bagga]] in the critically acclaimed blockbuster, ''[[Kannathil Muthamittal]]'', which explored the views of an adopted  child affected in war-torn [[Sri Lanka]]. The film's lead cast was praised by critics and won several awards at the Indian [[National Film Awards]]. He then had a second attempt at [[Bollywood]] with the multi-starrer, ''[[Dil Vil Pyar Vyar]]'' but once again his Hindi film flopped. His next project, ''[[Anbe Sivam]]'' with [[Kamal Haasan]] did well at the box-office. It was labelled by many as one of the finest films made and his co-star, [[Kamal Haasan]] received particular praise for his infamous portrayal of a street campaigner. 

R. Madhavan's following film projects such as [[Vikraman]]'s ''[[Priyamana Thozhi]]'' with [[Jyothika Saravanan]], [[Saran (director)|Saran]]'s ''[[Jay Jay]]'' with [[Pooja Umashankar]], [[Reema Sen]] and [[Nisha Kothari]] and [[K. S. Ravikumar]]'s ''[[Aethiree]]'' with [[Sadha]] and [[Kanika Subramaniam]] all didn't receive good reports by critics and were average-grossers at the box-office demoting Madhavan's prestige in the industry. Madhavan was criticized for ignoring the stories of the films and just playing the lead role in them. Eventhough ''[[Priyamana Thozhi]]'' was directed by [[National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment|National Award]] winner, [[Vikraman]], the film received a poor opening and the film lost out. The film told the story of two friends who were mistaken for lovers. ''[[Jay Jay]]'', directed by [[Saran (director)|Saran]] in which he was paired with then debutants, [[Pooja Umashankar]] and [[Nisha Kothari]], only did average business. ''[[Aethiree]]'' directed by noted director, [[K. S. Ravikumar]] opposite [[Sadha]] and [[Kanika (actress)|Kanika]] despite being a musical hit flopped at the box-office. Madhavan then teamed up with [[Nassar]] to act in a English film entitled ''[[Nothing But Life]]'' which was played at various International Film Festivals around [[Asia]], it released in India in [[2005]], however Madhavan commented in [[October]] [[2006]], it is a film he would like to forget.

==== 2004 – present ====

Madhavan has since come back from his small period of slumps with successful projects such as the multi-starrer ''[[Aayitha Ezhuthu]]'', directed by Mani Ratnam, where he played an off-beat negative role as a fighter for a politician. He co-starred with [[Surya Sivakumar]], [[Siddarth Narayan]], [[Trisha Krishnan]], [[Meera Jasmine]] and [[Esha Deol]]. Madhavan won the [[Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award South]] for the portrayal of the character Inba, which was played by [[Abhishek Bachchan]] in [[Yuva]], the [[Bollywood]] remake. He then continued his success at the box-office with hits such as ''[[Priyasakhi]]'', a family orientated film with [[Sadha]] which became the first film to be the first Tamil film to be dubbed into [[Zulu]]. After approximately 8 months, off the screen, he came back with the long-pending  film, ''[[Thambi]]'' as a [[Mahatma Gandhi]]-[[Subash Chandra Bose]] figure who sacrifces his life to stop growing forms of violence. The film despite receiving negative reviews from critics became a super hit and Madhavan received rave reviews for his portrayal of the character, ''Thambi Velu Thodaiman''  He has since boosted his chances in [[Bollywood]] with the role of Ajay Rathod in the Hindi blockbuster, ''[[Rang De Basanti]]'' which was sent in as [[India]]'s official entry to the Oscars for 2006. His next movie ''[[Rendu]]'', released in [[November]] [[2006]], saw him play his debut double-role, in which he played a blind man in a one of his roles. The film is heading for a Golden Jubilee Run in several theatres in [[Chennai]], the film's shoots were completed within two months. His latest project released on [[January 12]] wass [[Mani Ratnam]]'s ''[[Guru (2007 film)|Guru]]'', which he stars along with [[Abhishek Bachchan]], [[Aishwarya Rai]], [[Vidya Balan]] and [[Mallika Sherawat]]. In Guru, he played the role of an antagonist who opposes the ideas of the character played by [[Abhishek Bachchan]]. The film also contained Madhavan's first on-screen kiss with [[Vidya Balan]]. The film opened well to gain rave reviews from critics.

He also has a [[Hindi]]-[[Bengali]] bilingual, ''[[Sunglass (film)|Sunglass]]'' co-starring [[Konkona Sen Sharma]], [[Jaya Bachchan]] and [[Raima Sen]] set to release in [[March]] [[2007]]. Madhavan has also signed up to two [[Ram Gopal Varma]] production films, the first being a bi-lingual production''[[Leelai]]''/''[[Adi Oka Idhi Le]]'' in which he is paired with [[Shamita Shetty]] and [[Sadha]], for the third time, and he also has ''Yaaravan Nalam'' a [[Tamil language|Tamil]]-[[Hindi]] bilingual which is to take off late in 2007.

==Game Host==

{{main|Deal Ya No Deal}}
[[Image:ManmadhaMatjhavan.jpg|left|thumb|Madhavan as shown presenting, ''[[Deal Ya No Deal]]'']]
R. Madhavan was announced as the host of [[Sony]] Entertainment Television's ''[[Deal Ya No Deal]]'' in [[October 2005]] with a payment of Rs. 10 million per separate series. The show was being produced by Miditech, in association with Endemol BV. Deal Ya No Deal is a game show, testing the participant for speed, reflexes, wit, cunning and gaming skills. The contestant may win up to Rs. 10 million in a show. The contestant faces 22 cash boxes, containing cheques varying from a small amounts to Rs 10 million. Without knowing the contents, the contestant picks a single sealed box, for themselves to keep until the end of the show. It premièred on [[November 23]], 2005 on Sony Entertainment Television and aired on three nights each week. The first series had a set similar to the [[UK]] version, and the theme song and music cues were the same as those used in the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] version. Contestants held the cases. There is a top prize of 1 crore rupees ($10 million), and the lowest prize was a breath freshener, called a Chlor-mint.

Madhavan quit as the lead anchor of the game show, [[Deal Ya No Deal]] in [[January 2006]]. Madhavan claimed he was unhappy with the way the shoot schedules were handled by the production house. According to the actor, when he took on the show, he had made it clear that he would continue with his [[Kollywood|South film]] assignments, and as the show was being filmed in [[Mumbai]], he had found it hard to keep travelling throughout India from [[Chennai]] to film the ten days a month he had signed up for. The ever-changing look of the show meant Madhavan had to constantly rehearse. Madhavan also added that he was restricted by the producers to spend one day rehearsing technically, which left him with fatigue.
 
There were also some testing times, like when he shot for the show immediately after the funeral of his grandfather, when there was a celebrity special. [[Mandira Bedi]] replaced Madhavan as the anchor in [[February]] for Series 2 of the game show. Since then she has also left the set-up for personal unconfirmed reasons. He was also one of the guest judges in the Indian television show, [[Fame Gurukul]] which ended on 20 October 2005.

==Mobile Gaming Character==

A [[Mumbai]] based game development company, [[Paradox]] signed a worldwide contract Madhavan to create six mobile-based games based on him and his film roles. While launching the first game, ''Madhavan's MiG'' in [[Chennai]], Madhavan expressed his delight at being involved in projects aimed at young people. The 'paper-player' model would cost Rs 5 per download, while a one-time download would range from Rs.50-99, he said. The games, which consists of three levels, would be available on [[Reliance]], [[Idea]] and [[Spice]] mobile services. 

''Madhavan's MIG'' game will feature the actor make a reprise of his Rang De Basanti pilot role and the game will be based around basic steering of the planes. In the other game titled ''Madhavan'', the player will have to help the actor get to the premiere of his latest movie evading the paparazzi. Paradox has been developing games for wireless devices, apart from single and multi-player games for PC, web and allied platforms since 2001. Madhavan said the concept of couple of the games had been derived from his role of a pilot in the recent Hindi blockbuster, [[Rang De Basanti]], in which he flew an MiG 29 aircraft.
