'''Emmett Watson''' ([[November 22]] [[1918]] &ndash; [[May 11]] [[2001]]) was a [[Seattle, Washington]] based [[United States|American]] [[Columnist|newspaper columnist]] whose columns ran in a variety of Seattle newspapers over a span of more than fifty years. Initially a [[sports journalism|sportswriter]], he is primarily famous for writing a social commentary column for the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' (''P-I'') from [[1956]] until [[1982]], when he left the ''P-I'' and was subsequently hired by ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' to write a column.  

==Biography==
===Early life===

Emmett and his twin brother Clement were born on [[November 22]], [[1918]], the sons of Garfield and Lena McWhirt.<ref>http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=3274</ref> Emmett's mother and twin brother died of [[Spanish flu|Spanish Influenza]] the following year and his father, an itinerant laborer unable to care for his son, arranged for Emmett's adoption by long-time friends John and Elizabeth Watson of West Seattle.

Watson suffered an ear infection as a child that permanently damaged his hearing. He first attended high school in West Seattle before transfering to Franklin High School, where as a [[catcher]] he played [[baseball]] with future major league pitcher [[Fred Hutchinson]].<ref>http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=3274</ref> Emmett graduated from Franklin High School in 1937.

He continued his baseball career with the [[University of Washington]] Huskies, and then played very briefly with the [[Seattle Rainiers]] of the [[Pacific Coast League]], amassing one hit in a total of two at-bats. He often blamed his lack of success in professional baseball on his inability to hit a curveball. After leaving baseball, Watson worked in the Seattle and Tacoma Shipyards during World War II. In his spare time, he, along with some friends, produced a newsletter to send to baseball players serving in the military.<ref>http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=watson12m0&date=20010512&query=emmett+watson</ref>

The newsletter brought him to the attention of an [[editor]] at the ''[[Seattle Star]]'' (a now defunct daily newspaper) where Watson was hired to cover the Rainiers  in 1944. It was while working at the Star that Watson contracted [[polio]].

===Early career===

In 1946, ''The Seattle Times'' lured him away from the ''Star''. At the ''Times'', Watson continued to cover sports until 1950 when he received an offer from the ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'' that ''The Seattle Times'' chose not to match. Watson's bout with [[polio]] prompted a move from sports reporter to sports columnist, a position that allowed him to do much of his work by telephone. Another change came in 1956 when the ''P-I'' was pitched the idea of an "Around the Town" column by a group of restaurant owners who offered to partially underwrite the costs of producing the column in exchange for an occasional plug. The new column, "This, Our Town," was assigned to Watson.

===Columnist at the Seattle Post-Intelligencer===

Watson's new column quickly broadened its scope to cover all aspects of life in Seattle. In 1959 it was rechristened "This, Our City."<ref>http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=emmett0&date=20010520&query=emmett+watson</ref> By 1962, the column, utilizing primarily the "three dot" format, was running as often as six days a week. When a particular issue caught his attention, Watson would produce a longer, [[essay]]-style column. It was these essay-style columns that provided most of the fodder for his 1993 book, ''My Life in Print''.

In his column, as in his life, Watson was an early champion of [[civil rights]], [[reform movement|social reform]], and the [[peace movement|anti-war movement]].<ref>http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=watson12m0&date=20010512&query=emmett+watson</ref> He denounced [[urban renewal]] plans aimed at flattening [[Pioneer Square, Seattle, Washington|Pioneer Square]] and radically altering Seattle's [[Pike Place Market|Pike Place Public Market]]. He was the founder and leader of  "Lesser Seattle," a parody of Greater Seattle, Inc., which advocated several schemes for Seattle's civic improvement and development that Watson considered ill-advised. Feeling that the influx of outsiders, primarily from California, was ruining the city, Watson often published tongue-in-cheek columns suggesting ways to make visitors to Seattle feel unwelcome. He also invented a fictional organization called the [[Keep the Bastards Out]] (KBO) that fought against the influx of newcomers to the [[Puget Sound]] area from out of state. 

In 1961, Emmett Watson received international notoriety when he broke the story of [[Ernest Hemmingway|Ernest Hemingway's]] suicide, which had been falsely reported by Hemingway's wife as an accidental shooting.

Watson and long-time friend [[United States federal judge|U.S. District Judge]] Bill Dwyer were ringleaders in the anti-trust suit against [[Major League Baseball]] when the [[Seattle Pilots]] were moved to [[Milwaukee]] after a single season in Seattle in 1969.<ref>http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/connelly/23748_watson21.shtml</ref> It was the effectiveness of this action that proved to be instrumental in Seattle being awarded the [[Seattle Mariners]] Major League franchise in 1977. In the early 1980s Watson left the ''P-I'' after he believed he was treated unfairly by a new editor. Still contributing to the ''P-I'' as a freelancer, Watson's criticisms of then Mariner's owner [[George Argyros]] eventually led to the ''P-I'' reducing the frequency of his column. Watson remembered, "I picked up the paper and saw the column wasn't in there. The managing editor called and said he was thinking of cutting me back to one column a week. I said maybe we should make it zero columns a week."<ref>http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=watson12m0&date=20010512&query=emmett+watson</ref> Within days he was offered a job back at the Seattle Times.

===Columnist at the Seattle Times===

At ''The Seattle Times'' Watson continued to write his column in the style that had made him Seattle's best known newspaper columnist. As was his custom, he continued to skewer the rich and powerful in his columns, always fighting against the kind of development and modernization that he felt was destroying the city he knew and loved. Over the years the tone in his columns softened somewhat and they often consisted of his reminisces of "Old Seattle." In November of 2000, when his union, [[The Newspaper Guild]], went on strike against ''The Seattle Times'', Watson, now in his eighties, made regular, daily appearances on the picket lines. During the strike he wrote for the Seattle Union Record,<ref>http://www.washington.edu/alumni/columns/sept01/watson.html</ref> the strike paper of the [http://www.nwguild.org/ Pacific Northwest Newspaper Guild].

===Death===

In March of 2001 Emmett Watson underwent surgery for an abdominal [[aneurysm]] at [[Virginia Mason Medical Center|Virginia Mason Hospital]] in Seattle. He passed away of complications from the surgery on [[May 11]], [[2001]].

==Accomplishments==

Watson was called "one of the greats" by contemporaries [[Herb Caen]] of the [[San Francisco Chronicle]] and [[Jimmy Breslin]] of the ''[[New York Daily News]]''<ref>http://www.washington.edu/alumni/columns/sept01/watson.html</ref> and he considered himself of proteg√© of Caen's. He wrote four books (including ''My Life in Print'') and received the Distinguished Service Award from the [[Society of Professional Journalists]]' Western Washington Chapter in 1998.<ref>http://www.washington.edu/alumni/columns/sept01/watson.html</ref>
