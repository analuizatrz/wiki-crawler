'''Princess Alice of Battenberg''', later '''Princess Andrew of Greece and Denmark''' (Victoria Alice Elizabeth Julia Marie; [[25 February]] [[1885]] &ndash; [[5 December]] [[1969]]) was a great-granddaughter of the British [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]. She was the mother of [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] (consort of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]), and was the elder sister of [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten of Burma]] and [[Louise Mountbatten|Queen Louise of Sweden]].

Born congenitally deaf, she grew up in [[German Empire|Germany]], [[England]] and the [[Mediterranean]]. After marrying [[Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark]] in 1903, she lived in [[Greece]] until the exile of most of the [[Greek Royal Family]] in 1917. On returning to Greece a few years later, her husband was blamed in part for the defeat of Greece in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)]], and the family were once again forced into exile until the [[Greek plebiscite, 1935|restoration of the Greek monarchy in 1935]].

In 1930 she was diagnosed as [[schizophrenic]] and for the next six or seven years lived largely separated from her family. After her recovery, she devoted most of her remaining years to charity work in Greece, founding a nursing order of nuns called the Christian Sisterhood of Martha and Mary.

After the fall of King [[Constantine II of Greece]] and the [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974|imposition of military rule in Greece]] in 1967, she was invited to live at [[Buckingham Palace]] in [[London]] by her son and daughter-in-law. She died there two years later.

==Early life==
''Her Serene Highness'' Princess Victoria Alice Elizabeth Julia Marie of [[Battenberg family|Battenberg]] was born in the Tapestry Room at [[Windsor Castle]] in [[Berkshire]] in the presence of her great-grandmother, [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Vickers|first=Hugo|title=Alice, Princess Andrew of Greece|publisher=Hamish Hamilton|location=London|year=2000|isbn=0-241-13686-5|pages=p. 2}}</ref> She was the eldest child of [[Prince Louis of Battenberg]] ([[24 May]] [[1854]] &ndash; [[11 September]] [[1921]]) and his wife [[Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine]] ([[5 April]] [[1863]] &ndash; [[24 September]] [[1950]]). Her mother was the eldest daughter of [[Alice of the United Kingdom|Princess Alice, Grand Duchess of Hesse]], the second daughter of Queen Victoria and [[Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Albert]]. Her father was eldest son of [[Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine]] through his [[morganatic marriage]] to [[Julia von Hauke|Countess Julia von Hauke]].{{fact}}

She was christened in [[Darmstadt]] on [[25 April]] [[1885]]. Her godparents were her three surviving grandparents [[Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse|The Grand Duke of Hesse]], [[Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine]] and [[Julia von Hauke|Julia, Princess of Battenberg]], her aunts [[Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna|Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna of Russia]] and Princess Marie zu Erbach-Schönberg, and her great-grandmother [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom]].<ref>Vickers, p. 19</ref>

Princess Alice spent her childhood between [[Darmstadt]], [[Jugenheim]], [[Malta]] (where her naval officer father was occasionally stationed) and [[London]].<ref name="dnb">{{citation|first=Hugo |last=Vickers|title=Alice, Princess (1885–1969)|journal=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/66337 |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/66337|accessdate=2007-04-12}}</ref> She was diagnosed with congenital deafness, but learned to lip-read in [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]].<ref>Vickers, p. 26</ref> Educated privately, she studied [[French language|French]],<ref>Vickers, p. 57</ref> and later, after her engagement, she learned [[Greek language|Greek]].<ref>Vickers, pp. 57, 71</ref> A few weeks before her sixteenth birthday she attended the funeral of Queen Victoria in [[St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle]], and shortly afterward she was confirmed in the [[Protestant]] faith.<ref>Vickers, p. 51</ref>

==Marriage==
She met and fell in love with [[Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark|Prince Andrew]] (known as Andrea within the family), the fourth son of [[George I of Greece|King George I of the Hellenes]] and [[Olga Konstantinova of Russia|Queen Olga]], at [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]]'s coronation in 1902.<ref>Vickers, p. 52</ref> They married on [[7 October]] [[1903]] at [[Darmstadt]], and from then on she was known among English-speakers as ''Princess Andrew''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Eilers|first=Marlene A.|title=Queen Victoria's Descendants|publisher=Genealogical Publishing Co.|location=Baltimore, Maryland|year=1987|pages=p.181}}</ref> The bride and groom were closely related to the ruling houses of [[Great Britain]], [[Prussia]]/[[Germany]], [[Russia]], [[Denmark]], [[Greece]], [[Grand Duchy of Hesse|Hesse]], and [[Schleswig-Holstein]]; their wedding was one of the great gatherings of the descendants of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom]] and [[Christian IX of Denmark]] held before [[World War I]].<ref name="dnb" />

Prince and Princess Andrew of Greece had five children:{{fact}}
* [[Princess Margarita of Greece and Denmark]] ([[18 April]] [[1905]] &ndash; [[24 April]] [[1981]]); m. Gottfried, Prince of [[Hohenlohe-Langenburg]] ([[24 March]] [[1897]] &ndash; [[11 May]] [[1960]]), and had issue;
* [[Princess Theodora of Greece and Denmark (1906-1969)|Princess Theodora of Greece and Denmark]] ([[30 May]] [[1906]] &ndash; [[16 October]] [[1969]]); m. [[Prince Berthold, Margrave of Baden]] ([[24 February]] [[1906]] &ndash; [[27 October]] [[1963]]), and had issue;
* [[Princess Cecilie of Greece and Denmark]] ([[22 June]] [[1911]] &ndash; [[16 November]] [[1937]]); m. [[Georg Donatus, Hereditary Grand Duke of Hesse]] ([[8 November]] [[1906]] &ndash; [[16 November]] [[1937]]), and had issue;
* [[Princess Sophie of Greece and Denmark]] ([[26 June]] [[1914]] &ndash; [[24 November]] [[2001]]); m. 1st [[Prince Christoph of Hesse-Cassel]] ([[14 May]] [[1901]] &ndash; [[7 October]] [[1943]]), and had issue; m. 2nd [[Prince George William of Hanover]] ([[25 March]] [[1915]] &ndash; [[8 January]] [[2006]]); and
* [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark]] (born [[10 June]] [[1921]]); m. [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom]] and has issue.

Whilst Prince Andrew continued his career in the military, she became involved in charity work. In 1908 she visited Russia for the wedding of [[Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia (1890-1958)|Grand Duchess Marie of Russia]] to [[Prince Wilhelm, Duke of Södermanland|Prince William of Sweden]]. Whilst there she talked with her aunt, [[Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna]], who was formulating plans for the foundation of a religious order of nurses, and Princess Andrew attended the laying of the foundation stone for her aunt's new church. Later in the year, the Grand Duchess began giving away all her possessions in preparation for a more spiritual life.<ref>Vickers, pp.82-83</ref> On their return to Greece, Prince and Princess Andrew found the political situation worsening, a group of dissatisfied officers formed a [[Military League]] that eventually led to Andrew's resignation from the army and the rise to power of [[Eleutherios Venizelos]].{{fact}}

==Successive life crises==
With the advent of the [[Balkan Wars]] Andrew was reinstated to the army, and Princess Andrew acted as a nurse, assisting at operations and setting up field hospitals, for which work George V awarded her the [[Royal Red Cross]] in 1913.<ref name="dnb" /> During [[World War I]], her brother-in-law, [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine of Greece]], followed a neutrality policy despite the democratically elected Government of Venizelos supporting the Allies. Princess Andrew and her children were forced to shelter in the palace cellars during the French bombardment of Athens on [[1 December]] [[1916]].<ref>Vickers, p. 121</ref> By June 1917, the King's neutrality policy had become so unpopular and untenable that she and other members of the Greek royal family were forced into exile when her brother-in-law abdicated. For the next few years most of the Greek royal family lived in Switzerland.{{fact}}

The naval career of her father, Prince Louis of Battenberg, had collapsed at the beginning of the war in the face of anti-German sentiment in Britain. At the request of [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]], on [[14 July]] [[1917]], he relinquished the title Prince of Battenberg in the Grand Duchy of Hesse and the style [[Serene Highness]], and Anglicized the family name to Mountbatten. The following day, the King created him [[Marquess of Milford Haven]] in the [[peerage]] of the United Kingdom.<ref>Princess Alice of Battenberg never used the Mountbatten surname nor did she assume the [[courtesy title]] as a daughter of a British marquess since she had married into the Royal House of Greece in 1903.</ref> The following year, two of her aunts, [[Alix of Hesse|Alix, Tsarina of Russia]] and [[Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna]] were murdered by [[Bolsheviks]] after the [[Russian revolution]].{{fact}}

On King Constantine's restoration in 1920, they briefly returned to Greece, taking up residence at Mon Repos in [[Corfu]].<ref>Inherited by Prince Andrew on his father’s assassination in 1913.</ref> But after the defeat of the [[Hellenic Army]] in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)|Greco-Turkish War]], a Revolutionary Committee under the leadership of [[Syntagmatarkhis]] ([[Colonel]]) [[Nikolaos Plastiras]] and Syntagmatarkhis [[Stylianos Gonatas]] seized power and forced King [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine]] into exile once again.<ref>Vickers, p. 162</ref> Alice's husband Prince Andrew, who had served as commander of the Second Army Corps during the war, was arrested. Several former ministers and generals arrested at the same time were shot, and British diplomats assumed that Prince Andrew was also in mortal danger. After a show trial he was sentenced to banishment, and Prince and Princess Andrew and their children fled Greece aboard a British cruiser, [[HMS Calypso (D61)|HMS ''Calypso'']], under the protection of the British naval attaché, Commander Gerald Talbot.<ref>Vickers, p. 171</ref>

The family settled in a small house loaned to them by [[Princess Marie Bonaparte|Princess George of Greece]] at [[Saint-Cloud]], on the outskirts of [[Paris]], where the princess helped in a charity shop for Greek refugees.<ref>Vickers, p. 176-178</ref> She became deeply religious, and on [[20 October]] [[1928]] entered the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox Church]]. That winter, she translated her husband's defence of his actions during the Greco-Turkish War into English.<ref>{{cite book|last=Greece|first=H.R.H. Prince Andrew of|authorlink=Prince Andrew of Greece|coauthors=Translated and Preface by H.R.H. Princess Andrew of Greece|title=Towards Disaster: The Greek Army in Asia Minor in 1921|publisher=John Murray|location=London|year=1930}}</ref><ref>Vickers, p. 198-199</ref> However, she then began claiming that she was receiving divine messages, and that she had healing powers.<ref>Vickers, p.200</ref> In 1930, after suffering a severe nervous breakdown, Princess Andrew was diagnosed a paranoid [[schizophrenic]] at Dr Ernst Simmel's sanatorium at [[Tegel]], [[Berlin]].<ref>Vickers, p. 205</ref> She was forcibly removed from her family and placed in Dr [[Ludwig Binswanger]]'s sanatorium in [[Kreuzlingen]], [[Switzerland]].<ref>Vickers, p. 209</ref> Another patient there at the time was [[Vaslav Nijinsky]].<ref>Vickers, p. 213</ref> 

During Princess Andrew's long convalescence, she and Prince Andrew drifted apart, her daughters all married German noblemen between 1930 and 1931 (she did not attend any of the weddings), and Prince Philip went to England to stay with his uncles, [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Louis Mountbatten]] and [[George Mountbatten, 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven]], and his grandmother, the Dowager [[Princess Victoria of Hesse and the Rhine|Marchioness of Milford Haven]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Ziegler|first=Philip|authorlink=Philip Ziegler|title=Mountbatten|publisher=Collins|location=London|year=1985|isbn=0002165430|pages=p. 101}}</ref> 

She remained at Kreuzlingen for two years, but after a brief stay at a clinic in [[Merano]], was released and began an itinerant existence in Central Europe. She maintained contact with her mother, but broke off ties to the rest of her family until the end of 1936.<ref>Vickers, p. 245-256</ref> In 1937 her daughter Cécile, son-in-law and two of her grandchildren were killed in an air accident at [[Ostend]], she and Prince Andrew met for the first time in 6 years at the funeral ([[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]], [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Louis Mountbatten]] and [[Hermann Göring]] also attended).<ref>Vickers, p. 273</ref> In 1939, she returned to [[Athens]] alone to work with the poor, living in a two-bedroomed flat near the [[Benaki Museum]].<ref>Vickers, p. 281, p. 291</ref>

==World War II==
During [[World War II]], most of the Greek royal family remained in exile in [[South Africa]].<ref>Vickers, p. 292</ref> However, Princess Andrew was in the difficult situation of having son-in-laws fighting on the German side and a son in the [[Royal Navy]]. She and her sister-in-law, [[Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia|Princess Nicholas of Greece]] (the mother of [[Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent]]), lived in Athens for the duration of the war.<ref name="times">{{citation|title=Princess Andrew, Mother of the Duke of Edinburgh|journal=[[The Times]] (London)|date=Saturday [[6 December]] [[1969]]|pages=p. 8, col. E}}</ref> She moved out of her small flat and into her brother-in-law [[Prince George of Greece and Denmark|George]]'s three-storey house in the centre of Athens. She worked for the Red Cross organization, helped organize soup kitchens and flew to [[Sweden]], on the pretext of visiting her sister, to bring back medical supplies.<ref name="vickers">Vickers, p. 293-295</ref> After the fall of Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] in September 1943, the German Army occupied Athens, where the majority of Greek [[Jew]]s had sought refuge. During this period, Princess Andrew hid Jewish widower Rachel Cohen and two of her five children, who sought to evade the [[Gestapo]] and deportation to the death camps.<ref name="vickers2">Vickers, p. 298-299</ref> Rachel's husband, Haimaki Cohen, had aided [[George I of Greece|King George I]] in 1912-1913. In return, King George offered him any service that he could perform, should Cohen ever need it. Cohen's son remembered this during the [[Nazi]] threat, and appealed to Princess Andrew, one of only two remaining members of the Royal Family left in Greece (the other was Princess Nicholas). She honoured the promise and saved the Cohen family.<ref name="vickers2" />

As one of Alice's sons-in-law, Christoph von Hessen, was a member of the [[NSDAP]] and the [[Waffen-SS]], and another, Berthold von Baden, had been invalided out of the German army in 1940 after an injury in [[France]], the occuping forces presumably assumed Alice would be pro-German. Once, she was visited by a German general who asked her, "Is there anything I can do for you?" "You can take your troops out of my country," she replied.<ref name="vickers" />

Prince Andrew died towards the end of [[World War II]], just as hopes of a post-war reunion of the couple were rising.<ref name="times" />

==Widowhood==
[[Image:Princess Alice of Battenberg coronation.PNG|thumb|200px|Princess Alice, leading her family from [[Westminster Abbey]] following the coronation of her daughter in law, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]].]]

Princess Andrew returned to [[Great Britain]] in April 1947 to attend the wedding of her only son, now styled Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten R.N., to Princess Elizabeth, the elder daughter and heir presumptive of [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]], that November. She had some of her remaining jewels used in Princess Elizabeth's engagement ring.<ref>Vickers, p. 326</ref> She sat at the head of her family on the left side of [[Westminster Abbey]], opposite the King, [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Elizabeth]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]. It was decided<!--By who?--> not to invite Princess Andrew's daughters to the wedding because of the depth of anti-German sentiment in Britain following World War II.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bradford|first=Sarah|title=King George VI|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|location=London|year=1989|isbn=0297796674|pages=p. 424}}</ref>

In January 1949, the princess founded a nursing order of Greek Orthodox nuns, the ''Christian Sisterhood of Martha and Mary'', modeled after the convent that her aunt, the martyr [[Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna]], had founded in Russia in 1909. She trained on the Greek island of [[Tinos]], established a home for the order in a hamlet north of Athens, and undertook two tours of the [[United States]] in 1950 and 1952 in an effort to raise funds. She attended the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in June 1953 wearing a version of her nun's habit: a conservative two-tone grey long dress and a flowing nun-like headdress. However, the order eventually failed through a lack of suitable applicants.<ref name="nyt">{{citation|title=Princess Andrew of Greece, 84, Mother of Prince Philip, Dead|journal=[[New York Times]]|date=[[6 December]] [[1969]]|pages=p. 37 col. 2}}</ref>

Increasingly deaf and in failing health though incessant smoking, Princess Andrew left Greece for the last time following the [[21 April]] [[1967]] Colonels' Coup. Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh invited Princess Andrew to reside permanently in [[Great Britain]] at [[Buckingham Palace]].<ref name="dnb" /> [[Constantine II of Greece|King Constantine II of the Hellenes]] and [[Queen Anne-Marie of Greece|Queen Anne-Marie]] voluntarily went into exile that December after a failed royalist counter-coup.{{fact}} 

==Death and burial==
Despite suggestions of senility in later life, Princess Andrew remained lucid but physically frail.<ref>Vickers, p. 392</ref> She died at [[Buckingham Palace]] in December 1969. She left no possessions, having given everything away. Initially her remains were placed in the Royal Crypt in [[St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle]], but before she died she expressed her wish to be buried at the [[Church of Maria Magdalene|Convent of Saint Mary Magdalene]] in Gethsemane on the [[Mount of Olives]] (near to her aunt [[Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna]], a Russian Orthodox saint). When her daughter, [[Princess Sophie of Greece and Denmark|Princess George of Hanover]], complained that it would be too far away for them to visit her grave, she jested, "Nonsense, there’s a perfectly good bus service!"<ref>Vickers, p. 396</ref> Her wish was finally realized on [[3 August]] [[1988]] when her remains were transferred to her final resting place in a crypt below the church.<ref name="dnb" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jerusalem-mission.org/convent_magdalene.html|title=Convent of Saint Mary Magdalene - The Garden of Gethsemane|publisher=Russian Ecclesiastical Mission in Jerusalem|accessdate=2007-04-27}}</ref>

On [[31 October]] [[1994]], Princess Andrew's two surviving children, the Duke of Edinburgh and Princess George of Hanover, went to [[Yad Vashem]] (the Holocaust Memorial) in [[Jerusalem]] to witness a ceremony honoring her as "[[Righteous among the Nations]]" for having hidden the Cohen family in her house in Athens during the Second World War.<ref>Vickers, p. 398</ref> Prince Philip said of his mother's sheltering of persecuted Jews, "I suspect that it never occurred to her that her action was in any way special. She was a person with a deep religious faith, and she would have considered it to be a perfectly natural human reaction to fellow beings in distress."<ref>{{citation| last=Brozan|first=Nadine|title=Chronicle|journal=New York Times|date=[[1 November]] [[1994]]}}</ref>
