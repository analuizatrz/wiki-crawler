The '''West End of London''' is an area of [[Central London]], [[England]], containing many of the city's major tourist attractions, businesses, headquarters and the commercial [[West End theatre]]s. Use of the term began in the early 19th century to describe fashionable areas to the west of [[Charing Cross]].<ref name=mills>Mills, A., ''Oxford Dictionary of London Place Names'', (2001)</ref> For strategic planning the area is identified as one of two ''international centres'' in the [[London Plan]].<ref name=plan>Greater London Authority, ''[http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/strategies/sds/london_plan/lon_plan_5.pdf The London Plan: The Sub Regions]''</ref>

Located to the west of the historic [[Roman Britain|Roman]] and [[Mediaeval]] [[City of London]], the West End was long favoured by the rich elite as a place of residence because it was usually upwind of the smoke drifting from the crowded City. It was also located close to the royal seat of power at [[Westminster]], and is largely contained within the [[City of Westminster]] (one of the 32 [[London borough]]s). Developed in the [[17th century|seventeenth]], [[18th century|eighteenth]] and [[19th century|nineteenth centuries]], it was originally built as a series of palaces, expensive town houses, fashionable shops and places of entertainment. The areas closest to the City around [[Holborn]], [[Seven Dials]] and [[Covent Garden]] historically contained poorer communities that were cleared and redeveloped in the nineteenth century.

The name "West End" is a flexible term with different meanings in different contexts. It may refer to the entertainment district around [[Leicester Square]] and [[Covent Garden]]; to the shopping district centred on [[Oxford Street]], [[Regent Street]], and [[Bond Street]] (but the geographically distinct shopping district around [[Knightsbridge]] would also be counted as "West End Shopping" by some); or, less commonly, to the whole of that part of [[Central London]] (itself an area with no generally agreed boundaries) which lies to the west of the [[City of London]]. 

One of the local government [[ward (politics)|wards]] within the [[City of Westminster]] is called "West End". It is bounded by the [[City of London]] to the east, the [[Thames]] to the south east, [[Horseferry Road]] and [[Victoria Street, London|Victoria Street]] to the south, [[Grosvenor Place]] to the west and [[Piccadilly]] and [[Long Acre]] to the north. [http://www.westminster.gov.uk/gis/index.cfm?LayerID=55&LGSL=361,362,346] This is quite a narrow boundary. However, in the United Kingdom, ward boundaries are generally only familiar to people involved in local politics and administration, and this ward carries little weight as an "official" definition of the West End, and is not intended to do so.

Taking a fairly broad definition of the West End, the area contains the main concentrations of most of London's metropolitan activities apart from financial services, which are concentrated primarily in the City of London. There are major concentrations of the following buildings and activities in the West End:
*Art galleries and museums
*Company headquarters outside the financial services sector (although London's many [[hedge fund]]s are based mainly in the West End)
*Educational institutions
*Embassies
*Government buildings (mainly around [[Whitehall]])
*[[Hotels in London|Hotels]]
*Institutes, [[learned societies]] and think tanks
*Legal institutions 
*Media establishments
*Places of entertainment: theatres; cinemas; nightclubs; bars and restaurants
*Shops

The annual [[New Year's Day Parade|New Year’s Day Parade]] takes place on the streets of the West End. [[West End Live]], a showcase of musical theatre, takes place in [[Leicester Square]] in June.

==Districts in the West End==
[[Image:Trafalgarsquarecolumnandfountains.jpg|thumb|[[Trafalgar Square]] viewed from the northeast corner.]]
Using the broadest definition, these are the inner districts of the West End, which were all developed by about 1815:
* [[Bloomsbury]]
* [[Covent Garden]]
* [[Fitzrovia]]
* [[Holborn, London, England|Holborn]]
* [[Marylebone, London, England|Marylebone]]
* [[Mayfair, London, England|Mayfair]]
* [[Seven Dials]] 
* [[Soho]]
* [[St. James's]]
* [[Westminster, London, England|Westminster]]
The districts to the south, north and west of [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] and [[Kensington Gardens]] were developed between the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1815 and the late 19th century, in some cases based on existing villages. The more fashionable of them were generally regarded as being in the West End at that time, but the extension of the term to these areas west of [[Park Lane (road)|Park Lane]] is less common nowadays. The last two listed especially are fringe cases:

*[[Knightsbridge]] (listed as a distinct 'international centre' in the [[London Plan]])<ref name=plan/>
*[[Belgravia]]
*[[Pimlico]]
*[[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]]
*[[South Kensington]]
*[[Bayswater]]
