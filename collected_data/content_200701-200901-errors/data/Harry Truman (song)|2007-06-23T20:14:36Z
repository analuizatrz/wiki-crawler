"'''Harry Truman'''" is a song written by [[Robert Lamm]] for the group [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]] and recorded for their album ''[[Chicago VIII]]'' (1975), with lead vocals by Lamm. The first single released from that album, it reached #13 on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100]].

Written after the resignation of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Richard Nixon]], the lyrics are a tribute to a former President that Lamm felt the American people could trust -- straight-talking [[Harry S. Truman]]. "America needs you, Harry Truman."

Despite its popularity at the time, "Harry Truman" only appears on one of Chicago's compilation albums (''[[The Box (Chicago)|The Box]]'') and it is rarely performed in the band's live shows.
