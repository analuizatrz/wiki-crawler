'''André Derain''' ([[June 10]], [[1880]] – [[September 8]], [[1954]]) was a [[France|French]] painter and  illustrator.

==Biography==
Derain was born in 1880 in [[Chatou]], [[Île-de-France (region)|Île-de-France]]. In 1898, while studying to be an engineer, he began to attend painting classes at the Académie Camillo<ref>Cowling and Mundy, 1990, p. 92</ref> and studied with [[Eugène Carrière]]. In [[1900]], he met and shared a studio with [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] and began to paint his first [[Landscape art|landscapes]]; Vlaminck also introduced him to [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]].

Derain made his first impact on the Paris art scene in [[1905]], when he and Matisse displayed their highly innovative paintings at the [[Salon d'Automne]]. This exhibition led the critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]] to dub them ''[[les Fauves]]'' (the wild beasts). In March 1906, the noted art dealer [[Ambroise Vollard]] sent Derain to [[London]] to compose a series of paintings with the city as subject. In 30 paintings (29 of which are still extant), Derain put forth a portrait of London that was radically different from anything done by previous painters of the city such as [[James McNeil Whistler|Whistler]] or [[Claude Monet|Monet]]. With bold colours and compositions, Derain painted multiple pictures of the [[Thames]] and [[Tower Bridge]]. These London paintings remain among his most popular work. 

In [[1907]] he experimented with stone sculpture and moved to [[Montmartre]] to be near his friend [[Pablo Picasso]] and other notable artists. His work increasingly showed the influence of [[Paul Cézanne]] and of African art. Derain supplied woodcuts in primitivist style for an edition of [[Guillaume Apollinaire]]'s first book of prose, ''[[L'enchanteur pourrissant]]'' (1909), and illustrated a collection of poems by [[Max Jacob]] in [[1912]].

At about this time Derain's work began overtly reflecting his study of the [[Old Masters|old masters]]. The role of color was reduced and forms became austere; the years [[1911]]-[[1914]] are sometimes referred to as his [[Gothic art|gothic]] period. In 1914 he was mobilized for military service in [[World War I]] and until his release in [[1919]] he would have little time for painting, although in 1916 he provided a set of illustrations for [[André Breton]]'s first book, ''Mont de Piete''.

After the war, Derain won new acclaim as a leader of the renewed [[classicism]] then ascendant. With the wildness of his Fauve years far behind, he was admired as an upholder of tradition.<ref>Cowling and Mundy, 1990, pp. 92-93</ref> In [[1919]] he designed the [[ballet]] ''La Boutique fantasque'' for [[Serge Diaghilev|Diaghilev]], leader of the [[Ballets Russes]]. A major success, it would lead to his creating many ballet designs.

The 1920s marked the height of his success, as he was awarded the [[Carnegie Prize]] in [[1928]] and began to exhibit extensively abroad — in [[London]], [[Berlin]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Düsseldorf]], and in [[New York City]] and [[Cincinnati, Ohio]].

During the [[Germany|German]] occupation of [[France]] in [[World War II]], Derain lived primarily in [[Paris]] and was much courted by the Germans because he  represented the prestige of French culture. Derain accepted an invitation to make an official visit to [[Germany]] in [[1941]]. The [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[propaganda]] machine naturally made much of Derain's presence in Germany, and after the [[Liberation]] he was branded a collaborator and ostracized by many former supporters.

He died in [[Garches]], [[Hauts-de-Seine]], Île-de-France, France in 1954.

Today, paintings by Derain sell for as much as US$6 million. The London paintings were the subject of a major exhibition at the [[Courtauld Institute]] in 2005-06.
