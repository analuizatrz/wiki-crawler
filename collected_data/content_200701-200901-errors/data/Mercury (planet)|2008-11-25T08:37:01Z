'''Mercury''' (pronounced {{Audio-IPA|en-us-Mercury.ogg|/ˈmɝːkjʊəri/}}) is the innermost and smallest [[planet]] in the [[solar system]],<ref>[[Pluto]] was once considered the smallest, but is now classified as a [[dwarf planet]].</ref> [[orbit]]ing the [[Sun]] once every 88 days. Mercury is bright when viewed from [[Earth]], ranging from −2.0 to 5.5 in [[apparent magnitude]], but is not easily seen as its greatest [[Elongation (astronomy)|angular separation from the Sun]] is only 28.3°. It can only be seen in morning or evening [[twilight]]. Comparatively little is known about it; the first of two [[spacecraft]] to visit Mercury was [[Mariner 10|Mariner&nbsp;10]], which mapped only about 45% of the planet’s surface from 1974 to 1975. The second is the [[MESSENGER|MESSENGER spacecraft]], which mapped another 30% during its flyby of January 14, 2008.  MESSENGER will make one more pass by Mercury in 2009, followed by orbital insertion in 2011, and will then survey and map the entire planet.

Mercury is similar in appearance to the [[Moon]]: it is heavily [[impact crater|cratered]], has no [[natural satellite]]s and no substantial [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]]. However, unlike the moon, it has a large [[iron]] [[planetary core|core]], which generates a [[magnetic field]] about 1% as strong as that of the [[Earth]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www-spc.igpp.ucla.edu/personnel/russell/papers/merc_mag/|title=Mercury magnetic field|publisher=C. T. Russell & J. G. Luhmann|accessdate=2007-03-16}}</ref> It is an exceptionally dense planet due to the large relative size of its core. Surface temperatures range from about 90 to {{nowrap|700 [[Kelvin|K]]}} (−183&nbsp;°C to 427&nbsp;°C, −297&nbsp;°F to 801&nbsp;°F),<ref name="ESAs&t">{{cite web|url=http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/category/index.cfm?fcategoryid=4586|title=Background Science|publisher=European Space Agency|accessdate=2008-05-23}}</ref> with the [[subsolar point]] being the hottest and the bottoms of craters near the [[Geographical pole|poles]] being the coldest.

[[#Ancient astronomers|Recorded observations]] of Mercury date back to at least the first millennium BC. Before the 4th century BC, Greek astronomers believed the planet to be two separate objects: one visible only at sunrise, which they called [[Apollo]]; the other visible only at sunset, which they called [[Hermes]].<ref name="Dunne">{{cite book|title=The Voyage of Mariner&nbsp;10 — Mission to Venus and Mercury|author=Dunne, J.

==Internal structure==
Mercury is one of four [[terrestrial planet]]s in the [[solar system]], and is a rocky body like the Earth. It is the smallest planet in the solar system, with an [[equator]]ial [[radius]] of 2439.7&nbsp;km.<ref name="nssdcMercury" /> Mercury is even [[list of solar system objects by radius|smaller]]&mdash;albeit more massive&mdash;than the [[List of moons by diameter|largest]] [[natural satellite]]s in the solar system, [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] and [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]. Mercury consists of approximately 70% [[metal]]lic and 30% [[silicate]] material.<ref name="strom" /> Mercury's density is the second highest in the Solar System at 5.427&nbsp;g/cm³, only slightly less than Earth’s density of 5.515&nbsp;g/cm³.<ref name="nssdcMercury" /> If the effect of [[gravitational compression]] were to be factored out, the materials of which Mercury is made would be denser, with an uncompressed density of 5.3&nbsp;g/cm³ versus Earth’s 4.4&nbsp;g/cm³.<ref>{{cite web

Mercury’s density can be used to infer details of its inner structure. While the Earth’s high density results appreciably from gravitational compression, particularly at the [[planetary core|core]], Mercury is much smaller and its inner regions are not nearly as strongly compressed. Therefore, for it to have such a high density, its core must be large and rich in iron.<ref>{{cite journal

Mercury's core has a higher iron content than that of any other major planet in the Solar System, and several theories have been proposed to explain this. The most widely accepted theory is that Mercury originally had a metal-silicate ratio similar to common [[chondrite]] meteors, thought to be typical of the Solar System's rocky matter, and a mass approximately 2.25 times its current mass.<ref name="Benz" /> However, early in the solar system’s history, Mercury may have been struck by a [[planetesimal]] of approximately 1/6 that mass.<ref name="Benz" /> The impact would have stripped away much of the original crust and mantle, leaving the core behind as a relatively major component.<ref name="Benz" /> A similar process has been proposed to explain the formation of Earth’s [[Moon]] (''see [[giant impact theory]]'').<ref name="Benz" />

Alternatively, Mercury may have formed from the [[solar nebula]] before the Sun's [[energy]] output had stabilized. The planet would initially have had twice its present mass, but as the [[protostar|protosun]] contracted, temperatures near Mercury could have been between 2&nbsp;500 and 3&nbsp;500&nbsp;K (Celsius equivalents about 273 degrees less),  and possibly even as high as 10&nbsp;000&nbsp;K.<ref name="CameronAGW1">

Data from the October 2008 flyby of MESSENGER gave researchers a greater appreciation for the jumbled nature of Mercury's surface.  Mercury's surface is more heterogeneous than either Mars or earth's Moon, both of which contain significant stretches of similar geology (maria, plateaus etc.).<ref>Jefferson Morris, "Laser Altimetry", [[Aviation Week & Space Technology]] Vol 169 No 18, 10 Nov. 2008, p. 18: "Mercury's crust is more analogous to a marbled cake than a layered cake."</ref>

===Impact basins and craters===
[[Image:Caloris basin labeled.png|thumb|left|200px|Mercury’s [[Caloris Basin]] is one of the largest impact features in the Solar System.]]
[[Impact crater|Crater]]s on Mercury range in diameter from small bowl-shaped cavities to multi-ringed [[impact basin]]s hundreds of kilometers across. They appear in all states of degradation, from relatively fresh rayed craters to highly degraded crater remnants. Mercurian craters differ subtly from lunar craters in that the area blanketed by their ejecta is much smaller, a consequence of Mercury's stronger surface gravity.<ref name=Spudis01>{{cite journal

One hypothesis for its origin is that shock waves generated during the Caloris impact traveled around the planet, converging at the basin’s antipode (180 degrees away).

Overall, about 15 impact basins have been identified on the imaged part of Mercury. Other notable basins include the 400 km wide, multi-ring, [[Tolstoj Basin]] which has an ejecta blanket extending up to 500 km from its rim, and its floor has been filled by smooth plains materials. [[Beethoven Basin]] also has a similar-sized ejecta blanket and a 625 km diameter rim.<ref name=Spudis01/> Like the [[Moon]], the surface of Mercury has likely incurred the effects of [[space weathering]] processes, including [[Solar wind]] and [[micrometeorite]] impacts.<ref>{{cite journal

[[Image:Mercury's 'Weird Terrain'.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The so-called “Weird Terrain” was formed by the [[Caloris Basin]] impact at its antipodal point.]]

Smooth plains are widespread flat areas which fill depressions of various sizes and bear a strong resemblance to the lunar maria. Notably, they fill a wide ring surrounding the Caloris Basin. An appreciable difference between these plains and lunar maria is that the smooth plains of Mercury have the same albedo as the older inter-crater plains. Despite a lack of unequivocally volcanic characteristics, the localisation and rounded, lobate shape of these plains strongly support volcanic origins.<ref name=Spudis01/> All the Mercurian smooth plains formed significantly later than the Caloris basin, as evidenced by appreciably smaller crater densities than on the Caloris ejecta blanket.<ref name=Spudis01/> The floor of the Caloris Basin is also filled by a geologically distinct flat plain, broken up by ridges and fractures in a roughly polygonal pattern. It is not clear whether they are volcanic lavas induced by the impact, or a large sheet of impact melt.<ref name=Spudis01/>

One unusual feature of the planet’s surface is the numerous compression folds, or [[rupes]], which crisscross the plains. It is thought that as the planet’s interior cooled, it contracted and its surface began to deform. The folds can be seen on top of other features, such as craters and smoother plains, indicating that they are more recent.<ref>{{cite journal

[[Image:Merc fig2sm.jpg|thumb|left|Radar image of Mercury's north pole]]
Despite the generally extremely high temperature of its surface, observations strongly suggest that [[ice]] exists on Mercury. The floors of some deep craters near the poles are never exposed to direct sunlight, and temperatures there remain far lower than the global average. Water ice strongly reflects [[radar]], and observations by the 70m [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex|Goldstone]] telescope and the [[Very Large Array|VLA]] in the early 1990s revealed that there are patches of very high radar [[reflection]] near the poles.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Slade

Mercury is too small for its [[gravity]] to retain any significant [[atmosphere]] over long periods of time; however, it does have a "tenuous surface-bounded [[exosphere]]"<ref> [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007SSRv..131..161D Mercury's Atmosphere: A Surface-Bounded Exosphere] Publication: Space Science Reviews, Volume 131, Issue 1-4, pp. 161-186  Publication Date: 08/2007 DOI: 10.1007/s11214-007-9260-9</ref>  containing [[hydrogen]], [[helium]], [[oxygen]], [[sodium]], [[calcium]] and [[potassium]]. This exosphere is not stable—atoms are continuously lost and replenished from a variety of sources. Hydrogen and helium atoms probably come from the [[solar wind]], [[diffusion|diffusing]] into Mercury’s magnetosphere before later escaping back into space. [[Radioactive decay]] of elements within Mercury’s crust is another source of helium, as well as sodium and potassium. Water vapor is present, being brought to Mercury by some combination of processes such as: comets striking its surface, [[sputtering]] creating water "where none existed before from the ingredients of [[solar wind]] and Mercury rock" (both contain hydrogen and oxygen), and "reservoirs of water ice in small areas of Mercury's poles where local topography creates permanently shadowed spots in crater walls that might trap water over the age of the solar system". [[MESSENGER]] found high proportions of calcium, helium, [[hydroxide]], [[magnesium]], oxygen, potassium, [[silicon]], sodium, and water. The detection of high amounts of water-related ions like O<sup>+</sup>, OH<sup>-</sup>, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sup>+</sup> was a surprise.<ref>Hunten, D. M.; Shemansky, D. E.; Morgan, T. H.; ''The Mercury atmosphere'', In: Mercury (A89-43751 19-91).

Sodium and potassium were discovered in the atmosphere during the 1980s, and are believed to result primarily from the vaporization of surface rock struck by micrometeorite impacts. Due to the ability of these materials to diffuse sunlight, Earth-based observers can readily detect their composition in the atmosphere. Studies indicate that, at times, sodium emissions are localized at points that correspond to the planet's magnetic dipoles. This would indicate some interaction between the magnetosphere and the planet's surface.<ref name="chaikin1" />

==Magnetic field and magnetosphere==
[[Image:Mercury Magnetic Field NASA.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Graph showing relative strength of Mercury's magnetic field]]
Despite its small size and slow 59-day-long rotation, Mercury has a significant, and apparently global, [[magnetic field]]. According to measurements taken by Mariner&nbsp;10, it is about 1.1% as strong as the Earth’s. The magnetic field strength at the Mercurian equator is about 300&nbsp;[[Tesla (unit)|nT]].<ref>{{cite book

Mercury’s magnetic field is strong enough to deflect the [[solar wind]] around the planet, creating a [[magnetosphere]]. The planet's magnetosphere, though small enough to fit within the Earth,<ref name="chaikin1" /> is strong enough to trap solar wind plasma. This contributes to the [[space weathering]] of the planet's surface.<ref name="qq" /> Observations taken by the Mariner&nbsp;10 spacecraft detected this low energy plasma in the magnetosphere of the planet's nightside. Bursts of energetic particles were detected in the planet's magnetotail, which indicates a dynamic quality to the planet's magnetosphere.<ref name="chaikin1" />

==Orbit and rotation==
[[Image:ThePlanets Orbits Mercury PolarView.svg|left|thumb|230px|Orbit of Mercury (yellow)]]
Mercury has the most [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentric]] orbit of all the planets; its eccentricity is 0.21 with its distance from the Sun ranging from 46 to 70 million kilometers. It takes 88 days to complete an orbit.
The diagram on the left illustrates the effects of the eccentricity, showing Mercury’s orbit overlaid with a circular orbit having the same [[semi-major axis]]. The higher velocity of the planet when it is near perihelion is clear from the greater distance it covers in each 5-day interval. The size of the spheres, inversely proportional to their distance from the Sun, is used to illustrate the varying heliocentric distance.  This varying distance to the Sun, combined with a 3:2 [[Mercury (planet) #Spin–orbit resonance|spin-orbit resonance]] of the planet’s rotation around its axis, result in complex variations of the surface temperature.<ref name=strom>{{cite book

Mercury’s orbit is inclined by 7° to the plane of Earth’s orbit (the [[ecliptic]]), as shown in the diagram on the right. As a result, [[Transit of Mercury|transit]]s of Mercury across the face of the Sun can only occur when the planet is crossing the plane of the ecliptic at the time it lies between the Earth and the Sun. This occurs about every seven years on average.<ref>{{cite web

[[Image:ThePlanets Orbits Mercury EclipticView.svg|right|thumb|230px|Orbit of Mercury as seen from the ascending node (bottom) and from 10° above (top)]]
Functionally, Mercury’s [[axial tilt]] is nonexistent,<ref name="JPLweather">{{cite web|url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=725|title=Weather, Weather, Everywhere?|author=Samantha Harvey|publisher=[[NASA]] Jet Propulsion Laboratory|date=[[April 24]], [[2008]] |accessdate=2008-05-23}}</ref><ref name="Cosmic1">{{cite book|title=Cosmic Perspectives in Space Physics|author=S. Biswas|publisher=Springer|year=2000|pages=176}}</ref> with measurements as low as 0.027°.<ref name=Margot2007/> This is significantly smaller than that of Jupiter, which boasts the second smallest axial tilt of all planets at 3.1 degrees. This means an observer at Mercury’s equator during local noon would never see the Sun more than approximately 1/30{{Ref_label|A|a|none}} of one degree north or south of the [[zenith]]. Conversely, at the poles the Sun never rises more than 2.1′ above the horizon.<ref name=Margot2007/>

At certain points on Mercury’s surface, an observer would be able to see the Sun rise about halfway, then reverse and set before rising again, all within the same Mercurian day. This is because approximately four days prior to [[perihelion]], Mercury’s angular [[orbital velocity]] exactly equals its angular [[rotational velocity]] so that the Sun’s [[apparent motion]] ceases; at perihelion, Mercury’s angular orbital velocity then exceeds the angular rotational velocity. Thus, the Sun appears to move in a [[retrograde motion|retrograde]] direction. Four days after perihelion, the Sun’s normal apparent motion resumes at these points.<ref name="strom" />

===Advance of perihelion===
{{main|Tests of general relativity#Perihelion_precession_of_Mercury|Perihelion precession of Mercury}}
During the 19th century, the French [[mathematician]] [[Le Verrier]] noticed that the slow [[precession]] of Mercury’s orbit around the Sun could not be completely explained by [[Newtonian mechanics]] and perturbations by the known planets. He proposed that another planet might exist in an orbit even closer to the Sun to account for this perturbation. (Other explanations considered included a slight oblateness of the Sun.) The success of the search for [[Neptune]] based on its perturbations of the orbit of [[Uranus]] led astronomers to place great faith in this explanation, and the hypothetical planet was even named [[Vulcan (hypothetical planet)|Vulcan]]. However, no such planet was ever found.<ref>{{cite book

In the early 20th century, [[Albert Einstein]]’s [[General relativity|General Theory of Relativity]] provided the explanation for the observed precession. The effect is very small: the Mercurian relativistic perihelion advance excess is just 42.98 [[arcsecond]]s per century, therefore it requires a little over twelve million orbits for a full excess turn. Similar, but much smaller effects, operate for other planets, being 8.62 arcseconds per century for Venus, 3.84 for Earth, 1.35 for Mars, and 10.05 for [[1566 Icarus]].<ref>{{cite journal

[[Image:Mercury's orbital resonance.svg|thumb|right|200px|After one orbit, Mercury has rotated 1.5 times, so after two complete orbits the same hemisphere is again illuminated.]]

===Spin–orbit resonance===
For many years it was thought that Mercury was synchronously [[tidal locking|tidally locked]] with the Sun, [[rotation|rotating]] once for each orbit and keeping the same face directed towards the Sun at all times, in the same way that the same side of the Moon always faces the Earth. However, [[radar]] observations in 1965 proved that the planet has a 3:2 spin–orbit resonance, rotating three times for every two revolutions around the Sun; the eccentricity of Mercury’s orbit makes this resonance stable—at perihelion, when the solar tide is strongest, the Sun is nearly still in Mercury’s sky.<ref>{{cite journal

 | issue=3704 | pages=1717
 | doi=10.1126/science.150.3704.1717
 | pmid=17768871 }}</ref>

The original reason astronomers thought it was synchronously locked was that whenever Mercury was best placed for observation, it was always nearly at the same point in its 3:2 resonance, hence showing the same face. This is because, coincidentally, Mercury's rotation period is almost exactly half of its synodic period with respect to Earth. Due to Mercury’s 3:2 spin–orbit resonance, a [[solar day]] (the length between two [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian]] [[Astronomical transit|transit]]s of the Sun) lasts about 176 Earth days.<ref name="strom" /> A [[sidereal day]] (the period of rotation) lasts about 58.7 Earth days.<ref name="strom" />

Orbital simulations indicate that the eccentricity of Mercury’s orbit varies [[chaos theory|chaotically]] from 0 (circular) to a very high 0.47 over millions of years.<ref name="strom" /> This is thought to explain Mercury’s 3:2 spin-orbit resonance (rather than the more usual 1:1), since this state is more likely to arise during a period of high eccentricity.<ref name="Correia">{{cite journal

Like the Moon, Mercury exhibits [[Lunar phase|phases]] as seen from Earth, being "new" at [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)#Superior and inferior|inferior conjunction]] and “full” at [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)#Superior and inferior|superior conjunction]]. The planet is rendered invisible on both of these occasions by virtue of its rising and setting in concert with the Sun in each case. The first and last quarter phases occur at greatest [[Elongation (astronomy)|elongation]] east and west, respectively, when Mercury's separation from the Sun ranges anywhere from 17.9° at [[perihelion]] to 27.8° at [[aphelion]].<ref name=elongation>{{cite web

Mercury attains inferior conjunction every 116 days on average,<ref name="nssdcMercury" /> but this interval can range from 111 days to 121 days due to the planet’s eccentric orbit. Mercury can come as close as 77.3&nbsp;million km to the Earth,<ref name="nssdcMercury" />  but currently it does not come closer than 82&nbsp;million km from the Earth.<ref name=MercHorizons/> Its period of [[retrograde motion]] as seen from Earth can vary from 8 to 15 days on either side of inferior conjunction. This large range also arises from the planet’s high [[orbital eccentricity]].<ref name=strom />

Mercury is more often easily visible from Earth’s [[Southern Hemisphere]] than from its [[Northern Hemisphere]]; this is because its maximum possible elongations west of the Sun always occur when it is early autumn in the Southern Hemisphere, while its maximum possible eastern elongations happen during late winter in the Southern Hemisphere.<ref name="RASC2007" /> In both of these cases, the angle Mercury strikes with the [[ecliptic]] is maximized, allowing it to rise several hours before the Sun in the former instance and not set until several hours after sundown in the latter in countries located at southern temperate zone latitudes, such as [[Argentina]] and [[New Zealand]].<ref name="RASC2007" /> By contrast, at northern temperate latitudes, Mercury is never above the horizon of a more-or-less fully dark night sky.

The earliest known recorded observations of Mercury are from the [[MUL.APIN]] tablets.

===Ground-based telescopic research===
[[Image:Mercury transit 1.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Transit of Mercury]]. Mercury is the small dot in the lower center, in front of the sun. The dark area on the left of the solar disk is a sunspot.]]
The first [[telescope|telescopic]] observations of Mercury were made by [[Galileo]] in the early 17th century. Although he observed [[planetary phase|phases]] when he looked at Venus, his telescope was not powerful enough to see the phases of Mercury. In 1631 [[Pierre Gassendi]] made the first observations of the [[transit]] of a planet across the Sun when he saw a transit of Mercury predicted by [[Johannes Kepler]]. In 1639 [[Giovanni Battista Zupi|Giovanni Zupi]] used a telescope to discover that the planet had [[orbit]]al phases similar to Venus and the Moon. The observation demonstrated conclusively that Mercury orbited around the Sun.<ref name=strom/>

A very rare event in astronomy is the passage of one planet in front of another ([[occultation]]), as seen from Earth. Mercury and Venus occult each other every few centuries, and the event of [[May 28]] [[1737]] is the only one historically observed, having been seen by [[John Bevis]] at the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Sinnott |first=RW |authorlink= |coauthors=Meeus, J |year=1986 |month= |title=John Bevis and a Rare Occultation |journal=Sky and Telescope |volume=72 |issue= |pages=220 |id= |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1986S&T....72..220S |accessdate= |quote= }}</ref> The next occultation of Mercury by Venus will be on [[December 3]], [[2133]].<ref>{{cite book

The difficulties inherent in observing Mercury mean that it has been far less studied than the other planets. In 1800 [[Johann Schröter]] made observations of surface features, claiming to have observed 20&nbsp;km high mountains. [[Friedrich Bessel]] used Schröter's drawings to erroneously estimate the rotation period as 24 hours and an axial tilt of 70°.<ref>{{cite journal

Italian astronomer [[Giuseppe Colombo]] noted that the rotation value was about two-thirds of Mercury’s orbital period, and proposed that a different form of tidal locking had occurred in which the planet’s orbital and rotational periods were locked into a 3:2 rather than a 1:1 resonance.<ref>{{cite journal

 | publisher=NASA JPL | accessdate=2008-04-07 }}</ref> The 3:2 resonance results from Mercury's eccentric orbit, as the Sun raises higher tides on the planet at perihelion which, combined with the planet's high velocity then, make the planet spin faster. This also means that Schiaparelli's and Antoniadi's maps were not "wrong". Instead, the astronomers saw the same features during every ''second'' orbit and recorded them, but regarded those seen in the meantime, when Mercury's other face was toward the Sun, as spurious.

Ground-based observations did not shed much further light on the innermost planet, and it was not until space probes visited Mercury that many of its most fundamental properties became known. However, recent technological advances have led to improved ground-based observations. In 2000, high-resolution [[lucky imaging]] observations were conducted by the [[Mount Wilson Observatory]] 1.5 meter {{dp|Hale telescope}}.  They provided the first views that resolved some surface features on the parts of Mercury which were not imaged in the Mariner missions.<ref>{{cite journal

===Research with space probes===
{{main|Exploration of Mercury}}

Reaching Mercury from Earth poses significant technical challenges, since the planet orbits so much closer to the Sun than does the Earth. A Mercury-bound spacecraft launched from Earth must travel over 91 million kilometers into the Sun’s [[gravity|gravitational]] [[potential well]]. Starting from the Earth’s [[orbital speed]] of 30&nbsp;km/s, the change in [[velocity]] ([[delta-v]]) the spacecraft must make to enter into a [[Hohmann transfer orbit]] that passes near Mercury is large compared to other planetary missions.<ref name="DunneCh4">{{cite book|title=The Voyage of Mariner&nbsp;10 — Mission to Venus and Mercury|author=Dunne, J. A. and Burgess, E.|chapterurl=http://history.nasa.gov/SP-424/ch4.htm|publisher=NASA History Office|year=1978|chapter=Chapter Four|url=http://history.nasa.gov/SP-424/|accessdate=2008-05-28}}</ref>

The [[potential energy]] liberated by moving down the Sun’s [[potential well]] becomes [[kinetic energy]]; requiring another large delta-v change to do anything other than rapidly pass by Mercury. In order to land safely or enter a stable orbit the spacecraft must rely entirely on rocket motors since [[aerobraking]] is ruled out because the planet has very little atmosphere.  A trip to Mercury actually requires more rocket fuel than that required to [[escape velocity|escape]] the solar system completely.  As a result, only two space probes have visited the planet so far.<ref name="JPLprofile1">{{cite web|url=http://solarsystem.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Mercury&Display=OverviewLong|title=Mercury|publisher=[[NASA]] Jet Propulsion Laboratory|date=[[May 5]], [[2008]] |accessdate=2008-05-29}}</ref> A proposed alternative approach would use a [[solar sail]] to attain a Mercury-synchronous orbit around the Sun.<ref>{{ cite journal

The first spacecraft to visit Mercury was [[NASA]]’s [[Mariner 10|Mariner&nbsp;10]] (1974–75).<ref name="Dunne" /> The spacecraft used the gravity of [[Venus]] to adjust its orbital velocity so that it could approach Mercury, making it both the first spacecraft to use this [[Gravitational slingshot|gravitational “slingshot”]] effect and the first NASA mission to visit multiple planets.<ref name="DunneCh4" /> Mariner&nbsp;10 provided the first close-up images of Mercury’s surface, which immediately showed its heavily cratered nature, and also revealed many other types of geological features, such as the giant scarps which were later ascribed to the effect of the planet shrinking slightly as its iron core cools.<ref>{{cite web

On [[March 27]], [[1974]], two days before its first flyby of Mercury, Mariner 10's instruments began registering large amounts of unexpected ultraviolet radiation in the vicinity of Mercury. This led to the tentative identification of [[Mercury's moon]]. Shortly afterward, the source of some of the UV was identified as the star [[31 Crateris]], and Mercury's moon passed into astronomy's history books as a footnote.

The spacecraft made three close approaches to Mercury, the closest of which took it to within 327&nbsp;km of the surface.<ref name="AtlasM10">{{cite book|url=http://history.nasa.gov/SP-423/sp423.htm|title=Atlas of Mercury|publisher=[[NASA]] Office of Space Sciences|author=Merton E.

The second close approach was primarily used for imaging, but at the third approach, extensive magnetic data were obtained. The data revealed that the planet’s magnetic field is much like the Earth’s, which deflects the [[solar wind]] around the planet. However, the origin of Mercury’s magnetic field is still the subject of several competing theories.<ref name="Ness1">{{ cite journal | last = Ness| first = Norman F. | year = 1978| month = March|title=Mercury - Magnetic field and interior| journal = Space Science Reviews | volume = 21| pages = 527–553| bibcode = 1978SSRv...21..527N | url = http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1978SSRv...21..527N| accessdate = 2008-05-23|doi=10.1007/BF00240907}}</ref>

<!--[[Image:mercclose3.jpg|thumb|Mercury as imaged by the MESSENGER probe]]-->
The mission is designed to shed light on six key issues: Mercury’s high density, its geological history, the nature of its [[magnetic field]], the structure of its core, whether it really has ice at its poles, and where its tenuous atmosphere comes from. To this end, the probe is carrying imaging devices which will gather much higher resolution images of much more of the planet than Mariner&nbsp;10, assorted [[spectrometer]]s to determine abundances of elements in the crust, and [[magnetometer]]s and devices to measure velocities of charged particles. Detailed measurements of tiny changes in the probe’s velocity as it orbits will be used to infer details of the planet’s interior structure.<ref name="MSGRgrayzeck" />

The mapper probe will carry an array of spectrometers similar to those on MESSENGER, and will study the planet at many different wavelengths including [[infrared]], [[ultraviolet]], [[X-ray]] and [[gamma ray]]. Apart from intensively studying the planet itself, mission planners also hope to use the probe's proximity to the Sun to test the predictions of [[General Relativity]] theory with improved accuracy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=31350|title=Objectives|publisher=[[European Space Agency]]|date=[[February 21]], [[2006]]|accessdate=2008-05-29}}</ref>

The mission is named after [[Giuseppe Colombo|Giuseppe (Bepi) Colombo]], the scientist who first determined the nature of Mercury’s spin-orbit resonance and who was also involved in the planning of Mariner&nbsp;10’s gravity-assisted trajectory to the planet in 1974.<ref name="ESA pages" />
