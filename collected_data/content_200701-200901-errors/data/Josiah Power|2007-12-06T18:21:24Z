==Fictional character biography==
[[Image:Josiahpowerdcu1.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Josiah transformed from Power Company #4, artist [[Tom Grummett]]]]
The impressively tall, craggy featured Josiah Power was one of America’s best lawyers until his [[metahuman|metagene]] was triggered during the alien [[Invasion! (DC Comics)|Invasion]] by the activation of the '''Gene Bomb'''.<ref>http://www.dcuguide.com/who.php?name=josiahpower</ref>

Following the untimely public activation of his metagene in the court room, corporate attorney Josiah Power was dismissed from his law firm. Power had little interest in becoming a traditional costumed hero, but it became readily apparent that he could not continue to practice law without undue public attention. 

===Power Company===
{{main|Power Company}}
Working his way through a short depression and other problems, Josiah eventually found a way to combine his old skills and newfound abilities. He decided to found a business of ''superheroes for hire'', structured like a law firm, with partners and associates.

He called his new team, the '''Power Company'''. During his tenure in the team, he was put into a coma from a gunshot wound and [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] became an associate. He has since recovered and has continued active duty. Josiah lives with his [[life partner]] Rupert.

==Powers and abilities==
*He rarely participates in the Company’s missions.  He has made exceptions but only when the situation was dire. When he activates his powers Josiah transforms into a monstrous, grey, stone-like seven foot giant, and an energy corona begins to spark about his body. He gains great strength, invulnerability and possibly other energy based powers.<ref>http://www.dcuguide.com/who.php?name=josiahpower</ref>
*At one point, after seeing him in action, [[Superman]] stated that Josiah was one of the most powerful metas he'd ever met.
