[[Image:Floodforms library.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Halo''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief]] encounters various flood forms on Installation 04.]]
The '''Flood''' is a fictional [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[parasite|parasitic]] life form in the [[Halo (video game series)|Halo]] video game series. They are introduced in ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'' as a secondary enemy to the game's protagonist, [[Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief]], and return in ''[[Halo 2]]''. They are depicted as highly virulent and deadly, and with the ability to quickly incapacitate and infect their vectors. The Flood mutate their hosts into several different forms to serve different purposes. All of these forms have an attraction to any lifeform of sufficient mass to accommodate them and will try to attack or infect any potential host they encounter. 

The Flood make their first appearance in ''Halo: Combat Evolved''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s sixth level, "343 Guilty Spark."<!-- The Flood is not a level, it's a chapter in 343 GS --> After reaching [[Halo (megastructure)|Halo]]'s control room in the previous mission, Master Chief is sent by the AI [[Cortana]] to try and stop [[List of Halo series characters#Captain Jacob Keyes|Captain Jacob Keyes]] and his [[United Nations Space Command|UNSC]] Marines from reaching a weapons cache they believed was hidden in a [[Forerunner (Halo)|Forerunner]] structure by a swamp. In reality, the cache is false intelligence; instead of finding weapons, Keyes finds that a sizable population of Flood has been released from [[stasis]] by the [[Covenant (Halo)|Covenant]]. The Flood quickly escape containment and spread across the ringworld, threatening not only Humanity and the Covenant, but also the entire galaxy if they escape.

==Overview==
===Life Cycle===
In the game, the lifecycle of the Flood begins at the Infection form stage, as a small, frail, creature. These creatures leap upon a potential host and attempt to drive in three barbed tentacles (although the small spores that some Flood are seen to release are also used to either infect or incapacitate potential hosts, as [[343 Guilty Spark]] explains over in the level "The Library").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://halosm.bungie.org/story/level_transcripts/lv07_library.html|title= ''Halo'' Story Page Level Transcripts|work=halo.bungie.org|accessdate=Mar 10|accessyear=2006}}</ref> The infection form burrows into the host, and begins mutating the host body. In the video games, the host is seen carelessly treated, with infected limbs, rotting organs, and the neck of the host broken. The disused head of the victim can be destroyed without causing the Flood form pause, and hordes of Flood will attack the player without regard to casualties. If the host is of a suitable size, the infection form mutates the host into a Combat form.<ref name=h295>{{cite book |author= Piggyback||title=''Halo 2: The Official Strategy Guide: The Flood]''|year= 2004|publisher= Piggyback Interactive Ltd.|location=United States |isbn=0-7615-4473-9|pages=95}}</ref> If the host is not of sufficient size, or is not useful in battle, the next stage of mutation occurs. The upper body swells and incubates new Infection forms, creating a Carrier form. When the Carrier Form detects a suitable host in their proximity, they explode, releasing the Infection forms inside of them to continue the cycle.<ref name=h295 />

===Origins===
{{seealso|Forerunners (Halo)}}
The origins of the Flood have never been fully explained. In ''Halo: Combat Evolved'' the player learns that the ring they are playing on, [[Halo (megastructure)#Installation 04|Halo]], was built by the [[Forerunners (Halo)|Forerunners]] to contain the Flood, as well as being a weapon of last resort if the Flood were to escape. The Forerunners were eventually forced to activate [[Halo (megastructure)|Halo]] to prevent the galaxy-wide spread of the Flood, killing themselves and most other sentient life at the time.<ref>  '''343 Guilty Spark:''' After exhausting every other strategic option, my creators activated the rings.

===Game Development===
The Flood were added later in the game development stage of ''Halo: Combat Evolved'', after the game had made its jump from the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] platform and Bungie was bought by Microsoft. At one point, the ringworld ''Halo'' featured dinosaur-like terrestrial creatures, but due to gameplay constraints, these were dropped. An additional consideration was that Bungie felt the presence of other native species would dilute the impact and surprise of the Flood. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bungie.net/News/TopStory.aspx?story=prexboxhistory040904 |title=One Million Years B.X. |author=Bungie|date=2006-02-10 |work=bungie.net|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060210224125/http://www.bungie.net/News/TopStory.aspx?story=prexboxhistory040904 |archivedate=2006-02-10 }}</ref>

==Flood forms==
===Infection forms=== 
[[Image:Flood3.jpg|thumb|150px|Infection form]]
The infection forms are small creatures which use tentacles for mobility and infection, and are the base forms of Flood. They appear to have their own defined biological framework, as in the games they are seen without a host and do not appear to need one to survive. Individually they are weak and fragile; in the game they usually appear in large swarms. The infection forms will seek out any sentient life of sufficient [[Biomass (ecology)|bio-mass]] and [[calcium]] deposits to sustain itself, and proceed to attempt to use the creature as a host, by burrowing into the thoracic cavity, tapping into the spinal/nervous system, suppressing the host's consciousness, and releasing spores which cause the host to mutate.{{fact}} [[343 Guilty Spark]] mentions these "spores" during ''Halo: Combat Evolved''.<ref>'''343 Guilty Spark:''' You can see how the body's been transformed by the genetic restructuring of the Flood infection. The small creatures carry spores that cause a host to mutate. The mutated host then produces spores that can pass the Flood to others. - {{cite video game

In the ''Halo'' fiction, infection forms are seen to be unable to breach energy shields- those of the Master Chief's [[MJOLNIR]] armor, for instance, or the shields of [[Covenant Elite|Covenant Elites]]. However non-shielded enemies and allies are extremely vulnerable to attack, as even personnel armor can be pierced by the Infection form's tentacles.<ref>{{cite book |last= Dietz|first= William|title=[[Halo: The Flood]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45921-0 |pages=282}}</ref>

===Combat forms===
[[Image:Flood Human.jpg|thumb|150px|Human Combat form]]
If the host is strong or deemed "useful" by the parasitic infection form, it will be converted into a warrior or worker form, used in both defensive and offensive situations. As the Flood are seen to utilize the memories and knowledge of their hosts,<ref>{{cite book |last= Hammack|first= Lee|title=''[[Halo_graphic_novel#The_Last_Voyage_of_the_Infinite_Succor|The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor]]''|year= 2006|publisher= Marvel Comics|location=United States |isbn=0785123725|pages=25}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Dietz|first= William|title=[[Halo: The Flood]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45921-0 |pages=192}}</ref> they can repair or utilize weapons or machinery their hosts could use. These warrior or combat forms are extremely strong and agile, and are seen to be able to jump to extreme distances and heights, and attack enemies with whip-like tentacles. While damage to the host's head and limbs does not give the Combat form pause, disabling the infection form in turn disables the combat form. Combat forms ignore any threat to themselves and those fighting alongside them and will often kill themselves to kill an opponent.<ref name=h296>{{cite book |author= Piggyback||title=''Halo 2: The Official Strategy Guide: Combat Forms''|year= 2004|publisher= Piggyback Interactive Ltd.|location=United States |isbn=0-7615-4473-9|pages=96}}</ref>

===Carrier forms===
[[Image:Carrier Flood.jpg|thumb|150px|Carrier Form]]
The third stage of the Flood cycle.  Carriers grow large sacs which contain several infection forms. When a carrier is in close proximity to any number of suitable hosts or is sufficiently damaged, it triggers a biochemical reaction which causes the sacs to explode and release the infection forms in order to infect more hosts. Carrier forms cannot physically attack; however, the explosion of a carrier form is roughly equivalent to a grenade detonation, killing any Flood or Covenant within the blast radius.<ref name=h276>{{cite book |author= Piggyback||title=''Halo 2: The Official Strategy Guide: Carrier Forms''|year= 2004|publisher= Piggyback Interactive Ltd.|location=United States |isbn=0-7615-4473-9|pages=76}}</ref> Loose [[grenades]] are also set off by a carrier form's explosion. If carrier forms are hurled into the air by another's explosion, they will explode upon landing.<ref name=h276 />

===Brain forms===
[[Image:Brainform Flood.jpg|thumb|150px|Captain Keyes, mutated into a Brain Form]]
Brain forms are large, spongy creatures resembling a large bag of flesh with tentacles. They are seen used in ''Halo: The Flood'' to collect important data, such as codes, planet locations, and information about the species that the Flood can infect. In ''Halo'', [[Captain Jacob Keyes]] was subjected to an 'interrogation' of sorts by one of these forms before finally being completely assimilated.<ref>'''Cortana:''' No human life signs detected. The Captain... he's one of ''them!'' - {{cite video game

| developer = Bungie Studios
| publisher = Microsoft
| date = 2001
| platform =
| version = 
| level = Keyes
| language = English
| isolang = 
| quote = 
}}</ref>

Over time, the brain form strips memories and information from its victims.  However, Keyes was able to resist giving the Flood information regarding the location of Earth when he realized that the Flood could not strip away information that he could draw from his neural implants, such as his name, rank, serial number, and the name of the ship that he commanded.  Thus by "feeding" the Flood that information, he could continue to access it and avoid giving the Flood more important information.<ref>{{cite book |last= Dietz|first= William|title=[[Halo: The Flood]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45921-0 |pages=200}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Dietz|first= William|title=[[Halo: The Flood]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45921-0 |pages=225}}</ref>

===Command forms===
The command forms, due to their limited exposure in the [[Halo (video game series)|Halo]] trilogy, are not well understood. Their purpose is not exactly known. [[Gravemind]] from ''Halo 2'' is a command form over either all Flood or those on Installation 05 ([[Delta Halo]]). When the Flood invaded a Covenant supply ship in the ''[[Halo Graphic Novel]]'' story ''The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor'' they used corpses and dead biomatter to feed what appeared to be a much smaller, developing command form, which the Prophet Legate assumed to be a sort of central brain controlling the infestation.<ref>{{cite book |last= Hammack|first= Lee|title=''[[Halo_graphic_novel#The_Last_Voyage_of_the_Infinite_Succor|The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor]]''|year= 2006|publisher= Marvel Comics|location=United States |isbn=0785123725|pages=10}}</ref>

==Flood details==
It appears that the Flood can infect recently dead lifeforms, as the [[Hierarchs (Halo)#High Prophet of Regret|Prophet of Regret]] is assimilated by [[Gravemind]] shortly after being assasinated by the Master Chief in ''[[Halo 2]]''. However, one of the Marines in ''Halo: Combat Evolved'' evades the Flood by playing dead.<ref>'''Marine:''' Play dead! That's what I did... played dead. They took the live ones... - {{cite video game

Most Flood on [[Alpha Halo|Installation 04]] were destroyed due to detonation of the ''[[Pillar of Autumn]]'''s engines in ''Halo: Combat Evolved'', but in ''Halo 2'' they returned, with the ability to operate in-game vehicles. In ''Halo 2'', the Flood on [[Delta Halo]] are led by the command form [[Gravemind#The Gravemind|Gravemind]], a massive creature that dwells beneath Delta Halo's Library and on [[High Charity]]. It is not currently known if there is a command form with Gravemind's abilities on each ''Halo'', or if the command form Gravemind encountered on [[Delta Halo]] is unique.
