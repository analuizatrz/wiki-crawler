'''Tenacious D''' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA pronunciation]]: {{IPA|[tə-nā'shəs di]}}); is an [[United States|American]] [[rock music|rock band]] duo composed of musician/actors [[Kyle Gass]] (a.k.a. "KG", "Kage","Rage Kage") and [[Jack Black]] (a.k.a. "JB", "Jables"). Their music fuses vulgar absurdist comedy with [[rock music]];<ref name="AMG">{{cite news | author=Heather Phares | title=AMG Biography | work=AMG | url=http://www.allmusicguide.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:7tdsa9ygi23k | accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref> a style that has been described as "mock rock".<ref name=john-kerry-benefit>{{cite news | author=Cathrin Schaer | title=Tenacious D: Mocknrollers | work=http://www.nzherald.co.nz | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/6/story.cfm?c_id=6&objectid=9002730 | date=[[2004-12-12]] | accessdate=2007-01-11}}</ref><ref name='The National Student Magazine'>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=The Pick of Destiny | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.national-student.co.uk/magazine/film/features/tenacious_d.htm | work =The National Student Magazine | pages = | accessdate = 2007-01-26 | language = }}</ref><ref name='The Independant'>{{cite news | first=Simon | last=Price | coauthors= | title= Iron Maiden, Metro Radio Arena, Newcastle | date=[[2007-01-26]] | publisher= | url =http://enjoyment.independent.co.uk/music/reviews/article2103664.ece | work =The Independant | pages = | accessdate = 2007-01-26 | language = }}</ref>

Tenacious D's music showcases Black's theatrical, versatile vocals and Gass' skill in playing the acoustic guitar. Many of their songs discuss the duo's musical and sexual prowess, as well as their friendship and use of [[cannabis]]. Their albums also feature absurd and humorous sketches.

The band first gained popularity in [[1999]] when they starred in the eponymously titled ''[[Tenacious D (TV series)|Tenacious D]]'' TV series, in which JB and Kage established themselves as the "Greatest Band on Earth." The series is occasionally aired on [[Comedy Central]] and is available on [[The Complete Masterworks]]. In addition to recording two albums, Jack and Kyle have written and starred in [[Tenacious D in: The Pick of Destiny|their own movie]]. The storyteller-style lyrics of the songs can be compared to lyrics of [[rock opera]] and [[power metal]] bands, like [[Meat Loaf]], [[The Who]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Black Sabbath]], [[Styx]] and [[Alice Cooper]].

Tenacious D are also known by their nickname, "The D". <ref name="AMG">{{cite news | author=Heather Phares | title=AMG Biography | work=AMG | url=http://www.allmusicguide.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:7tdsa9ygi23k | accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref>

==History==
===Beginnings===

Black, then 16, first met 24-year-old Kyle Gass in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]]<ref name="tenacious-d-scotsman">{{cite news | author=Rory Ford | title=Best band in the world? | work=Edinburgh Evening News | date=2003-03-13 | accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref><ref name="tenacious-d-edinburgh">{{cite news | author=Chay Woodman | title=Tenacious D Interview | work=Virtual Festivals | url=http://www.virtualfestivals.com/artists/article.cfm?artistid=-1&articleid=411&startrow=2 | date=2006-02-7 | accessdate=2006-12-19}}</ref> during the [[Edinburgh Fringe]] whilst the two were members of the "[[The Actors' Gang]]" theater troupe based in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]].

While they can both sing and play the guitar, Black is billed as lead singer and Gass as [[lead guitar|lead guitarist]].

===TV series (1997 &ndash; 2000)===
{{main|Tenacious D (TV series)}}
In 1997, HBO aired two episodes of ''Tenacious D'', right after ''[[Mr. Show]]''<ref name="ign-tenacious-d">{{cite news | author=Brian Zoromski | title=Tenacious D: The Series | work=IGN.com | url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/746/746937p1.html | date=2006-11-20 | accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref> for two weeks. The other four episodes were not aired until 1999. The show was about the trials and tribulations of a band trying to make it in the music business. The show's six episodes featured many songs that went on to be re-recorded and put on the band's first album, as well as songs that have not otherwise been released. The episodes were as follows: The Search for Inspirado; Angel in Disguise; Death of a Dream; The Greatest Song in the World; The Fan and Road Gig. Though featuring songs composed by Jack and Kyle, the tone and content of the series was very much shaped by collaborators [[Bob Odenkirk]], [[David Cross]], and director [[Tom Gianas]].

<!--I think more happened in this period that just a TV series-->
After the TV series aired, the band continued to perform. At a show at the Viper Room in Los Angeles, they met [[Dave Grohl]],<ref name="dave-grohl-tenacious-d">{{cite news | author= Jon Zahlaway | title=liveDaily Interview: Dave Grohl Of Foo Fighters | work=liveDaily | url=http://www.livedaily.com/interviews/liveDaily_Interview_Dave_Grohl_Of_Foo_Fighters-734.html?t=6 | date=2000-04-13 | accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref><ref name="dave-grohl-tenacious-d-kerrang">{{cite news | author=Kerrang! | title=Dave Grohl interviews Tenacious D: Kerrang!

===First album (2001 &ndash; 2003)===

[[Image:Tenaciousd stancecover2001.jpg|thumb|Tenacious D pictured on the cover of Stance magazine, titled as "the band your parents will definitely hate".|right]]
Tenacious D released ''[[Tenacious D (album)|Tenacious D]]'' (#38 UK), in [[2001]]. For their first album, they enlisted the help of [[Dave Grohl]] on drums, keyboardist [[Page McConnell]] of [[Phish]], guitarist [[Warren Fitzgerald]] of [[the Vandals]], and bassist [[Steve McDonald]]. The [[Dust Brothers]] produced the album. The majority of the songs on the album are based on their short-lived [[HBO]] television series.

Several songs on this album are preceded by "skits" where Jack and Kyle go through some sort of rudimentary creative process or argument which immediately precedes the next song. Most of these skits are adapted from episodes of their show and showcase the band's [[Surreal humour|absurdist humor]].

{{listen|filename=Tribute (Tenacious D song sample).ogg|title="Tribute"|description="Tribute" from ''[[Tenacious D (album)|Tenacious D]]''.}}

The first single from the album was the band's signature song [[Tribute (song)|Tribute]] - a tribute to the "greatest and best song in the world", which, as the song describes, they once played to outwit a demon, but subsequently forgot how to play. The video clip for the song was directed by [[Liam Lynch]], and features [[Dave Grohl]] as Satan, [[Jason Reed|Jason "JR" Reed]] as the security guard, and a cameo by [[Ben Stiller]].

Two follow-up singles were released from the album. The first was "Dio", a tribute to rock singer [[Ronnie James Dio]], that accused him of being too old, and asked for him to stop playing rock music and allow Tenacious D to fill his shoes. Dio liked the song enough to let the band appear in the music video for his song, "Push." The last single was "[[Fuck Her Gently]]", which had a [[music video]] that featured animations by [[Spümcø]], the studio behind ''[[Ren and Stimpy]]''.

The album achieved [[platinum]] status on [[8 November]], [[2005]].<ref>RIAA certifications [http://www.riaa.com/ Recording Industry Association of America] Accessed [[31 January]] [[2007]]</ref> The response to the album was varied. [[Entertainment Weekly]] described the release as being "hilarious", and "no mere comedy record".<ref name="s">{{cite news | author=Ken Tucker | title=Music Review: Tenacious D | work=Entertainment Weekly | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/review/music/0,6115,175539~4~~tenaciousd,00.html | date=[[2001-09-24]] | accessdate=2006-12-21}}</ref>.

An EP entitled "[[D Fun Pak]]" was released in 2002. It featured a skit and acoustic versions of ''[[Jesus Ranch]]'' and ''Kyle Quit The Band'', as well as [[megamix]]. The CD was was available free with the album or sold separately. <ref name='Tenacious Joe's'>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Tenacious Joe's: Album | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.tenaciousjoes.com/tenaciousdalbum.html | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2007-01-31 | language = }}</ref> 

In 2003, they released a [[DVD]] entitled ''[[The Complete Masterworks]]'', which features the entire run of their TV series, videos, and a live performance from [[London]]'s [[Brixton Academy]] (recorded on November 3, 2002).

===Film and their second album (2004 &ndash; 2006)===

In July 2004, the band started production on their film, ''[[Tenacious D in: The Pick of Destiny]]''. Filming was delayed by almost a year due to Jack Black being cast in [[Peter Jackson]]'s big budget remake of ''[[King Kong (2005)|King Kong]]'', which was shot in [[New Zealand]]. While on location, JB continued to work on preproduction for the Tenacious D film.  Once Black was done with ''King Kong'', shooting for ''The Pick of Destiny'' started in April 2005<ref name="imdb-dates">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365830/business</ref> with director [[Liam Lynch (musician)|Liam Lynch]], who not only directed the band's ''Tribute'' music video, but also the [[MTV]] show ''[[Sifl and Olly]]''. A month later, in May 2005, the band started recording songs for the soundtrack of the movie, which is their second studio album, ''[[The Pick of Destiny]]''.<ref name="official-news">http://www.tenaciousd.com/news-cps.html</ref> The second Tenacious D album had [[John Konesky]] on lead electric guitar and [[John Spiker]] on bass and backing vocals. Both of these artists are members of Kyle's band [[Trainwreck (band)|Trainwreck]], which also features Lee. Dave Grohl was once again called to be the drummer, and also lent vocals to ''Beelzeboss (The Final Showdown)'' as well as acting in the film, reprising the role that he played in the ''Tribute'' video as the Demon. 

The film, which is a fictional portrayal of the beginnings of the band and their rise to super-stardom, was released on [[November 22]], [[2006]].  It debuted in 11th place during the very busy Thanksgiving weekend. The soundtrack was released just over a week earlier, on [[November 14]] and reached number #8 on the [[Billboard 200]] in the US,<ref name="pick-of-destiny-soundtrack-billboard-chart">{{cite news | author=Anthony Breznican | title=Plucky Tenacious D duo get into their 'Destiny' | work=USA Today | url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2006-11-23-tenacious-D-side_x.htm?csp=34 | date=[[2006-11-24]] | accessdate=2006-12-18}}</ref> #10 in the UK, and #35 in Australia.

The film opened to poor box office results, perhaps owing to the eagerly awaited movies ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'' and Channel 4 spin off ''[[Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan|Borat]]''. The film was released on [[November 22]], [[2006]] and as of [[December 17]], [[2006]] has earned $8,232,726 domestically, <ref name='Rotten Tomatoes'>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Tenacious D in: The Pick of Destiny Box Office and Rental Numbers | date= | publisher= | url =http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/tenacious_d_in_the_pick_of_destiny/numbers.php | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2007-01-31 | language = }}</ref> making it currently the 167th highest grossing film of 2006. The film has also earned $3,917,225 in the United Kingdom, giving it a worldwide total of $12,141,951. It opened in 11th place for both the standard three day weekend as well as the five day Thanksgiving weekend, followed by a 15th place performance the following week.

{{main|Tenacious D's 2006-07 Tour}}
To coincide with the release of their new movie and album, Tenacious D embarked on a [[Tenacious D's 2006-07 Tour|tour of the USA, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand]].  This tour, with stops mainly in small theatres, included the band's first headlining date at a major arena, [[New York City]]'s [[Madison Square Garden]] and also their biggest concert to date at the MEN Arena in Manchester to a sold out crowd of 23,000 people.  It has been reported that the band has lost money on the tour.<ref name="set">{{cite news | author=The List | title=Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny | work=The List | url=http://www.list.co.uk/magazine/index.php?w=module:article,action:view,id:639 | date=[[2006-11-15]] | accessdate=2006-12-18}}</ref>  Both hometown concerts at the [[Gibson Amphitheatre]] were undersold.  The band also heavily promoted the album and film by performing on the daytime and late night talk show circuit, and appearances on the [[American Music Awards]] and ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.  While "The D" had performed on ''SNL'' in the past (usually when Jack Black was the host), this was the first time the band was the musical guest.

==Tenacious D's work==
===Film===
The first appearance of Black and Gass performing together came about in ''[[Bio-Dome]]'' (1996), and they later both appeared in ''[[The Cable Guy]]'' (1996) and ''[[Cradle Will Rock]]'' (1999) and ''[[Saving Silverman]]'' and ''[[Shallow Hal]]'', both released in 2001, although none of these appearances were officially by Tenacious D. ''[[Bongwater (film)|Bongwater]]'' (1997) also featured Black, as his character Devlin, performing "[[Jesus Ranch]]", which would later be featured in an episode of their TV series. Black also starred in a number of films himself including ''[[School of Rock]]''. In 2006, the D starred in their own movie, ''[[Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny]]'', in which they set out to become the greatest rock band in the world, by means of a [[guitar pick]] with supernatural powers.

=== Notable television appearances ===
Black and Gass were featured as puppets performing "Friendship" from their first album on an episode of ''[[Crank Yankers]]''. Later, the duo made an appearance in the first episode of ''[[Tom Goes to the Mayor]]'' to be televised on [[Adult Swim]].  In the episode, the duo were known as "The Bear Trap Brothers," two competitive brothers who ran bear trap shops that were located side-by-side. Gass has also appeared in an episode of [[Friends]] playing a mugger and an old friend of Phoebes. 

The duo appeared in musical promo spots on MTV during the week before the premiere of "[[The Osbournes]]". The two musical shorts featured Jack Black and Kyle Gass dressed in stereotypical rock outfits. These appearances were featured on [[Tenacious D - The Complete Masterworks|The Complete Masterworks]] as an [[Easter egg]]. In [[April 27]], [[2002]] they guest stared on [[Mad TV]] playing the song "Tribute".

In the run up to the release of The Pick of Destiny, Tenacious D made several appearances. At the 2006 American Music Awards (11/21/06) the duo performed [[POD (song)|POD]]. On November 27, 2006, they were guests in a Canadian [[MTV Live (Canada)|MTV Live]] interview. The duo appeared as guests on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart on November 30, 2006.
