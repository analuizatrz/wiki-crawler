The '''Su-25''' ([[NATO reporting name]] ''''Frogfoot'''') is a battlefield [[attack aircraft|attack]], [[close air support]], and [[anti-tank]] aircraft designed by the [[Soviet Union]]. It remains in service with [[Russia]] and other [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] member states, as well as a variety of export customers.

==Development==
The Su-25 was designed by [[Sukhoi]] as a result of studies in the late 1960s on an aircraft to fill the ''Sturmovik'' ground attack role. The Frogfoot is heavily armed, with a [[Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-30-2]] 30mm cannon and various air-to-ground munitions; it can carry more than 4,000 kg of weaponry in the ground-attack role. It is comparable to the [[A-10 Thunderbolt II]], although it more closely resembles the [[Northrop YA-9]], which lost the [[United States Air Force|USAF]] competition that produced the A-10. (The same requirement led to the development of [[fighter bomber]] versions of the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23|MiG-23 'Flogger']], culminating in the definitive [[Mikoyan MiG-27|MiG-27 'Flogger']], although those aircraft share nothing with the Su-25 in design.)

The first prototype, with the bureau designation '''T-8-1''', made its first flight on [[22 February]] [[1975 in aviation|1975]]. Development problems delayed its service entry until April [[1981 in aviation|1981]]. Early examples that were observed by the west were spotted at the Zhukovsky flight test centre near the town of [[Ramenskoye]], resulting in the temporary codename of '''Ram-J.''' The Ram-J was initially believed to have overwing mounted [[turbojets]] and a [[tailplane]] mounted midway up the vertical stabilizer, unlike the actual aircraft.

The Su-25, which is called ''Grach'' ([[rook (bird)|rook]]) in [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] service, was heavily used by the [[Soviet Union]] during its operations in [[Afghanistan]] in the 1980s. 22 Su-25 were lost in this conflict. 

Two-seat '''Su-25UB''' [[trainer]]s were also built, including a small number for the [[Soviet Navy|AVMF]] designated '''Su-25UTG'''. They had strengthened airframes and an [[arresting hook]] for practicing [[aircraft carrier]] landings. The first Su-25UTG flew in September [[1988 in aviation|1988]], and about ten were produced. About half remain in Russian service, used with Russia's sole carrier, [[Soviet aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov|''Admiral Kuznetsov'']]. The Russian navy ordered ten more '''Su-25UBP''' aircraft, much like the earlier Su-25UTG, but with a retractable [[aerial refueling]] probe.

More advanced attack variants, the '''Su-25T''' (alternatively, '''Su-34''', although the OKB appears to have given that designation to the 'Flanker' derivative, the [[Sukhoi Su-34|Su-34 'Fullback']]) and later '''Su-25TM''' ('''Su-39'''), were developed with an improved nav/attack system, better survivability, and capability of carrying new precision-guided weapons. Only a handful of each version has been produced. However, the improved systems from these aircraft have been utilised in the '''Su-25SM''', an upgrade for series produced Su-25s for the Russian Air Force, resulting in superior survivability and combat capability.

The upgraded SU-25KM “'''Scorpion'''”, developed by [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] aerospace manufacturer [[Tbilisi Aerospace Manufacturing|TAM]] in conjunction with [[Elbit Systems]] of [[Israel]], is enhanced with the most advanced avionics, designed to elevate its unique capabilities and to provide a head-start into the 21st century as a model for close-attack aircraft. Avionics include “Glass cockpit” arrangement; digital map generator; display and sight helmet; computerized weapons system; complete mission pre-plan capability; fully redundant backup modes; extremely reliable and very easy to maintain. Performance enhancements include: Highly accurate navigation; pinpoint weapon delivery systems; all weather and day/night performance; NATO compatibility; high level of situational awareness; state-of-the art safety and survivability features; advanced onboard debriefing capabilities complying with international requirements.

The [[Sukhoi Su-28]] was built as a variant of the Su-25UB, which adopted the role of primary trainer and demonstrator.
