'''Tick''' is the common name for the small [[arachnid]]s that, along with other [[mite]]s, constitute the [[order (biology)|order]] ''Acarina''.  Ticks are [[ectoparasite]]s (external parasites), living by [[hematophagy]] on the [[blood]] of [[mammal]]s, [[bird]]s, and occasionally [[reptile]]s and [[amphibian]]s. Ticks are important [[Vector (biology)|vector]]s of a number of diseases, including [[Lyme disease]].

== Characteristics ==

The major families of tick include the Ixodidae or hard ticks, which have thick outer shells made of [[chitin]], and Argasidae or soft ticks, which have a membraneous outer surface. A third family, [[Nuttalliellidae]], contains one rare African species, ''Nuttalliella namaqua''.  Soft ticks typically live in crevices and emerge briefly to feed, while hard ticks will attach themselves to the skin of a host for long periods of time.  Tick bites look like [[mosquito]] bites, but can also sometimes bruise or resemble a bullseye.

Hard ticks can transmit human diseases such as [[relapsing fever]], [[Lyme disease]], [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]], [[tularemia]], [[equine encephalitis]], [[Colorado tick fever]], and several forms of [[ehrlichiosis]].  Additionally, they are responsible for transmitting [[livestock]] and [[pet]] diseases, including [[babesiosis]], [[anaplasmosis]] and [[cytauxzoonosis]]. 

Soft ticks transmit relapsing fever [[spirochaete|spirochetes]] such as ''Borrelia turicatae'', ''Borrelia parkeri'' and ''Borrelia hermsii''. 

Generally, [[tick-borne disease]]s correspond to a specific tick-host combination, and are limited in their geographical extent.  For example, nearly 90% of all [[Lyme disease]](caused by the ''Borrelia burgdorferi'' bacterium) cases have been reported in the Northeastern part of the US; <ref name="RhodeIslandTicks1">{{cite web

The West Coast, although originally identified by A.C.Steere as a focus of Lyme disease, has traditionally been viewed as having minimal tick infection rates.  In the past, it was believed that the role of the Western Fence Lizard in the California tick life cycle produced adult tick infection rates of only 2-3%.  However, a landmark study in 2003 published in The Journal of Medical Entomology by the San Jose State Entomology Department found that the minimum infection rates of the microbe ''Borrelia burgdorferi'' in the tick ''Ixodes pacifica'' were much higher in Santa Cruz County, up to 17.8% in [[The Forest of Nisene Marks State Park]].  This completely transformed traditionally held views of Lyme disease in California as a minimal risk and instead raised the specter of rampant misdiagnosis as the reason for the lower case numbers.  Rick Vetter of UC Riverside has shown in published work that tick-induced Lyme disease rashes in California are often misidentified as [[brown recluse]] spider bites, when, in fact, brown recluse spiders have never been documented in California.

==Location==

<!-- This section needs to be expanded and cover more general info, than north US-->
Ticks are blood-sucking parasites that are often found in tall [[grass]] or trees, where they will rest themselves at the tip of a blade so as to attach themselves to a passing animal. Ticks can also sense heat and fall from a limb onto prey underneath.  Physical contact is the only method of transportation for ticks. They will generally drop off the animal when full, but this may take several days.  Ticks have a harpoon-like structure in their mouth area, known as a [[hypostome]], that allows them to anchor themselves firmly in place while sucking blood. This mechanism is normally so strong that removal of a lodged tick requires two actions: One to remove the tick, and one to remove the remaining head section of the tick.

== Population control ==

A method of reducing deer tick (''Ixodes scapularis/dammini'') populations  - Damminix [http://www.ticktubes.com] -  may be cited. It consists of biodegradable cardboard tubes stuffed with [[permethrin]]-treated cotton and works in the following way: Mice collect the cotton for lining their nests. The pesticide on the cotton kills any immature ticks that are feeding on the mice. It is important to put the tubes where mice will find them, such as in dense, dark brush or at the base of a log; mice are unlikely to gather the cotton from an open lawn. Best results are obtained with regular applications early in the spring and again in late summer. The more neighbors who also use Damminix, the better. Damminix appears to help control tick populations, particularly in the year following initial use. Note that it is not effective on the West Coast. See [http://www.umm.edu/patiented/articles/how_can_lyme_disease_other_tick-borne_infections_be_prevented_000016_8.htm] UMM Patient Education Link.

A potential alternative to Damminix's permethrin is [[fipronil]]. It is used in the Maxforce Tick Management system, in which fipronil is painted onto rodents visiting the plastic baitboxes. see[http://www.maxforcetms.net/]. This system is no longer generally available for sale by Bayer.  In 2005, there were selective reports of grey squirrels "chewing" into some Maxforce TMS boxes in areas of the northeastern United States, compromising the child resistant box. Due to this problem, the Federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) asked that all similarly designed TMS boxes applied in 2006 be covered with a protective shroud capable of preventing squirrel damage. The Maxforce TMS system remains registered by the federal EPA for its continued use. A metal shroud has been developed and is reportedly in use to eliminate any potential squirrel damage to the plastic box. This shroud reportedly satisfies the EPA's mandate to protect the boxes from such damage and is recommended by Bayer Environmental Science. Availability however outside of Connecticut , New York, New Jersey and Rhode Island may be minimal. 

The parasitic [[Ichneumon wasp]] ''[[Ixodiphagus hookeri]]'' has long been investigated for its potential to control tick populations. It lays its eggs into ticks; the hatching wasps kill its host.

Another "natural" form of control for ticks is the [[Guineafowl]]. They consume mass quantities of ticks. Just 2 birds can clear 2 acres in a single year. However they can be quite noisy, and employers of this method should be prepared for complaints from neighbors.

Topical (drops/dust) flea/tick medicines need to be used with care. [[Phenothrin]] (85.7%) in combination with Methopren was a popular topical flea/tick therapy for felines. Phenothrin kills adult fleas and ticks. Methoprene is an insect growth regulator that interrupts the insect's life cycle by killing the eggs. However, the US EPA has made at least one manufacturer of these products (Hartz Mountain Corp., Secaucus, New Jersey, USA), withdraw some products and include strong cautionary statements on others, warning of adverse reactions (http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/factsheets/flea-tick-drops.htm).

==Example species==
[[Image:Tick male size comparison (aka).jpg|left|thumb|Male tick size comparison to a match.]]
*''[[Dermacentor variabilis]]'', the American [[dog]] tick, is perhaps the most well-known of the North American hard ticks. This tick does not carry Lyme disease, but can carry [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]].
[[Image:Tick engorged with thumb.jpg|right|thumb|Engorged deer tick attached to back of toddler's head. Adult thumb shown for scale.]]
*''Ixodes scapularis'' (formerly ''Ixodes dammini''), known as the black-legged tick or [[deer]] tick, is common to the eastern part of [[North America]] and is known for spreading [[Lyme disease]].
*''Ixodes pacificus'', the Western black-legged tick, lives in the western part of North America and is responsible for spreading Lyme disease and the more deadly [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]]. It tends to prefer livestock as its adult host.
*In some parts of Europe, [[tick-borne meningoencephalitis]] is a common [[Virus|viral]] infection.
[[Image:Tick 2 (aka).jpg|thumb|''Ixodes ricinus'']]
*[[Australia]]n tick fauna consists of approximately 75 species, the majority of which fall into the ''Ixodidae'', hard tick, family. The most medically important tick is the [[Paralysis tick]], ''Ixodes holocyclus''.  It is found in a 20-kilometre band that follows the eastern coastline of Australia. As this is where much of the human population resides in [[New South Wales]], encounters with these parasites are relatively common. Although most cases of tick bite are uneventful, some can result in life threatening illnesses including paralysis, tick [[typhus]] and severe allergic reactions.<ref name = "usydticks">{{cite web
