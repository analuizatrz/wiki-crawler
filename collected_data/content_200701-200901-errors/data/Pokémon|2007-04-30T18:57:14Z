{{nihongo|'''''Pokémon'''''|ポケモン|Pokemon|extra={{IPA2|ˈpoʊ.keɪ.mɑn}}}} is a [[media franchise]] owned by video game giant [[Nintendo]] and created by [[Satoshi Tajiri]] around 1995. Originally released as a pair of interlinkable [[Game Boy line|Game Boy]] [[Computer RPG|role-playing]] [[video game]]s, ''Pokémon'' has since become the second most successful and lucrative videogame-based media franchise in the world, falling only behind Nintendo's ''[[Mario]]'' series.<ref name="UK paper names top game franchises ">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6164012.html |title=UK paper names top game franchises |accessdate=2007-02-26|last=Boyes |first=Emma |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=[[2007]]-[[01-10]] |year= |month= |format= |work=GameSpot |publisher=GameSpot UK |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> Pokémon properties have since been [[Merchandising|merchandised]] into [[anime]], [[manga]], [[Collectible card game|trading cards]], toys, books, and other media. The franchise celebrated [[Pokémon: Tenth Anniversary|its tenth anniversary]] on [[27 February]], [[2006]], and as of [[1 December]] 2006, cumulative sold units of the video games (including home console versions, such as the "Pikachu" [[Nintendo 64]]) have reached more than 155 million copies.<ref name="sales release 12 01 2006">{{cite web |url=http://www.n-sider.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2543 |title=Nintendo sales through end of November revealed |accessdate=2006-12-01 |last=Behrens |first=Matt |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=[[2006-12-01]] |year= |month= |format= |work=N-Sider |publisher=N-Sider Media |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

The name ''Pokémon'' is the  [[Romanization of Japanese|romanized]] [[contraction (grammar)|contraction]] of the Japanese brand, {{nihongo|"Pocket Monsters" |'''ポケ'''ット'''モン'''スター|'''Poke'''tto '''Mon'''sutā}},<ref name="The Pokemon Series Pokedex @ Gaming Target">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamingtarget.com/article.php?artid=6531 |title=The Pokemon Series Pokedex @ Gaming Target |accessdate=2007-02-28 |last=Swider |first=Matt |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work=Gaming Target |publisher=Gaming Target |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> as such contractions are very common in Japan. The term "Pokémon", in addition to referring to the ''Pokémon'' franchise itself, also collectively refers to the 493 [[List of Pokémon|fictional species]] that have made appearances in ''Pokémon'' media as of the recent release of the newest Pokémon role-playing games (RPGs) for the [[Nintendo DS]], [[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl|''Pokémon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']]. As  with the words [[deer]] and [[sheep]], the singular and plural forms of the word "Pokémon" do not differ, nor does each individual species name; in short, it is grammatically correct to say both "one Pokémon" and "many Pokémon". Nintendo originally translated ''Poketto Monsutā'' literally, but a naming conflict with the [[Monster in My Pocket]] toy line caused Nintendo to rebrand the franchise as "Pokémon" in early 1996.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} The game's [[catchphrase]] in the [[Japanese language]] versions of the franchise is "ポケモンGETだぜ! (Pokémon Getto Daze! - Let's Get Pokémon!)"{{Fact|date=February 2007}}; in [[English language]] versions of the franchise, it was originally "Gotta catch 'em all!," although it is now no longer officially used except in the sidestory episodes airing under the name ''[[Pokémon Chronicles]]''.

In November 2005, [[4Kids Entertainment]], which had managed the non-game related licensing of Pokémon, announced that it had agreed not to renew the Pokémon representation agreement. Pokémon USA Inc., a subsidiary of Japan's Pokémon Co., now oversees all Pokémon licensing outside of Asia.<ref>"[http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=7615 Pokemon USA Moves Licensing In-House]," ''Gamasutra''.</ref>



==Collecting and playing==
The concept of the ''Pokémon'' universe, in both the video games and the general fictional world of ''Pokémon'', stems from the hobby of insect collecting, a popular pastime which ''Pokémon'' executive director Satoshi Tajiri had enjoyed as a child.<ref> "[http://web.archive.org/web/20050314021722/http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/99/1122/pokemon6.fullinterview1.html The Ultimate Game Freak: Interview with Satoshi Tajiri]," ''TimeAsia'' ([[Waybacked]]).</ref> Players of the games are designated as [[Pokémon Trainer]]s, and the two general goals (in most ''Pokémon'' games) for such Trainers are: to complete the [[Pokédex]] by collecting all of the available Pokémon species found in the fictional region where that game takes place; and to train a team of powerful Pokémon from those they have caught to compete against teams owned by other Trainers, and eventually become the strongest Trainer, the Pokémon Master. These themes of collecting, training, and battling are present in almost every version of the ''Pokémon'' franchise, including the [[Pokémon (video games)|video games]], the [[Pokémon (anime)|anime]] and manga series, and the [[Pokémon Trading Card Game]].

In most incarnations of the fictional ''Pokémon'' universe, a Trainer that encounters a wild Pokémon is able to capture that Pokémon by throwing a specially designed, mass-producible tool called a [[Poké Ball]] at it. If the Pokémon is unable to escape the confines of the Poké Ball, that Pokémon is officially considered under the ownership of that Trainer, and it will obey whatever commands its new master and/or friend (depending on how that trainer treats Pokémon in general) issues to it from that point onward, unless the Trainer demonstrates enough of a lack of experience that the Pokémon would rather act on its own accord. Trainers can send out any of their Pokémon to wage non-lethal battles against Pokémon; if the opposing Pokémon is wild, the Trainer can capture that Pokémon with a Poké Ball, increasing his or her collection of creatures. (Pokémon already owned by other Trainers cannot be captured, except under special circumstances in certain games.) If a Pokémon fully defeats an opponent in battle so that the opponent is knocked out ("faints"), the winning Pokémon gains experience and may [[level up]]. When leveling up, the Pokémon's statistics ("[[Pokémon game mechanics|stats]]") of battling aptitude increase, including Attack, Speed, and so on. From time to time the Pokémon may also learn new [[Pokémon move|moves]], which are techniques used in battle. In addition, many species of Pokémon possess the ability to undergo a form of [[metamorphosis]] and transform into a similar but stronger species of Pokémon, a process called [[Pokémon evolution|evolution]].

In the main series, each game's single-player mode requires the Trainer to raise a team of Pokémon to defeat many [[non-player character]] (NPC) Trainers and their Pokémon. Each game lays out a somewhat linear path through a specific region of the Pokémon world for the Trainer to journey through, completing events and battling opponents along the way. Each game features eight especially powerful Trainers, referred to as Gym Leaders, that the Trainer must each defeat in order to progress. As a reward, the Trainer receives a Gym Badge, and once all eight badges are collected, that Trainer is eligible to challenge the region's Pokémon League, where four immensely talented trainers (referred to collectively as the "Elite Four") challenge the Trainer to four Pokémon battles in succession. If the trainer can overcome this gauntlet, he or she must then challenge the Regional Champion, the master Trainer who had previously defeated the Elite Four. Any Trainer who wins this last battle becomes the new champion and gains the title of Pokémon Master.

==Generations==<!--Please don't delete/rename this header as it is linked to from a number of places.-->
{{main|Pokémon (video games)}}

The original Pokémon games were Japanese [[Console role-playing game|RPGs]] with an element of strategy, and were created by Satoshi Tajiri for the Game Boy. These role-playing games, and their sequels, remakes, and English language translations, are still considered the "main" Pokémon games, and the games which most fans of the series are referring to when they use the term "Pokémon games."

All of the licensed Pokémon properties overseen by [[The Pokémon Company]] are divided roughly by generation. These generations are roughly [[chronological]] divisions by release; every several years, when an official sequel in the main RPG series is released that features new Pokémon, characters, and gameplay concepts, that sequel is considered the start of a new generation of the franchise. The main games and their spin-offs, the anime, the manga, and the trading card game are all updated with the new Pokémon properties each time a new generation begins. The franchise is currently in its fourth generation.

Douglas; Elies, Mark. Pokémon Trainer's Guide. Sandwich Islands Publishing, 1999. ISBN 0-439-15404-9. (pg73)</ref>]]
The Pokémon franchise started off in its first generation with its initial release of [[Pokémon Red and Blue#Pocket Monsters|''Pokémon Red'' and ''Green'']] for the [[Game Boy]] in Japan. When these games proved extremely popular, an enhanced ''Blue version'' was released sometime after, and the ''Blue version'' was reprogrammed as [[Pokémon Red and Blue|''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'']] for international release. The games launched in the United States on September 30, [[1998 in video gaming|1998]]. The original ''Red'' and ''Green'' versions were never released outside of Japan.<ref>[http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/gameboy/data/924467.html "Pokemon Green Info on GameFAQs"] ''gamefaqs.com'' URL Accessed February 23, 2007</ref> Afterwards, a further enhanced remake titled ''[[Pokémon Yellow]]'' was released to partially take advantage of the color palette of the [[Game Boy Color]], as well as to feature more of a stylistic resemblance to the popular Pokémon anime. This first generation of games introduced the original 151 species of Pokémon (in [[List of Pokémon|National Pokédex]] order, encompassing all Pokémon from [[Bulbasaur]] to [[Mew (Pokémon)|Mew]]), as well as the basic game concepts of capturing, training, battling, and trading Pokémon with both computer and human players. These versions of the games take place within the fictional [[Kanto (Pokémon)|Kanto]] [[Pokémon regions|region]], though the name "Kanto" was not used until the second generation. Spin-off first-generation titles include ''[[Pokémon Pinball]]'', an adaption of the ''[[Pokémon Trading Card Game]]'' for [[Game Boy Color]], an on-rails photography simulator for [[Nintendo 64]] titled ''[[Pokémon Snap]]'', a Nintendo 64 Pokémon-themed adaption of ''[[Tetris Attack]]'' named ''[[Pokémon Puzzle League]]'', a 3D Nintendo 64 incarnation of the handheld RPGs' battle system named ''[[Pokémon Stadium]]'', and a co-starring role for several species in the Nintendo 64 fighting game ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]''<ref>''Super Smash Bros.''

[[Image:Croconaw screen.png|thumb|left|Screenshot of ''[[Pokémon Crystal]]'', portraying a player's Level 18 [[Croconaw]] battling a Level 13 [[Snubbull]].]]
The second generation of Pokémon began in [[2000 in video gaming|2000]] with the release of [[Pokémon Gold and Silver|''Pokémon Gold'' and ''Silver'']] for [[Game Boy Color]]. Like the previous generation, an enhanced remake titled ''[[Pokémon Crystal]]'' was later released. It introduced 100 new species of Pokémon (starting with [[Chikorita]] and ending with [[Celebi]]), for a total of 251 Pokémon to collect, train, and battle. New gameplay features include a day-and-night system (reflecting the time of the day in the real world) which influences events in the game; full utilization of the Game Boy Color's color palette; an improved interface and upgraded inventory system; better balance in the collection of Pokémon and their moves, statistics, and equippable items (a new addition); [[Pokémon breeding]]; and a new region named [[Johto]]. Unique to the second generation games is the fact that, after exploring Johto, the player can enter and explore the original Kanto region, which lies to the east of Johto. Spin-off second-generation titles include the Game Boy Color adaption of ''Pokémon Puzzle League'' named ''[[Pokémon Puzzle Challenge]]'', a Nintendo 64 pet simulator named ''[[Hey you, Pikachu!]]'', the ''Pokémon Stadium'' sequel ''[[Pokémon Stadium 2]]'' for Nintendo 64, several Pokémon mini-games for the [[e-Reader]], and a co-starring role for many species in the ''Super Smash Bros.'' sequel ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'' for [[Nintendo Gamecube]].<ref>[http://www.nintendo.com/codegallery?gameid=m-Game-0000-587#m-CodeItem-0000-5887 ''Super Smash Bros. Melee'' Unlockable character guide] ''Nintendo.com''.

[[Image:Pokémon Emerald screenshot.png|right|thumb|A [[Pokémon Emerald|''Pokémon Emerald'']] screenshot featuring an enemy [[Pupitar]] and [[Solrock]] fighting in a double battle against a player's [[Aggron]] and [[Smeargle]].]]
''Pokémon'' entered its third generation with the [[2003 in video gaming|2003]] release of [[Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pokémon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']] for [[Game Boy Advance]] and continued with the Game Boy Advance remakes of ''Pokémon Red and Blue'', [[Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen|''Pokémon FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'']], and an enhanced remake of ''Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire'' titled ''[[Pokémon Emerald]]''. The third generation introduced 135 new Pokémon (starting with [[Treecko]] and ending with [[Deoxys]]) for a total of 386 species. It also features a much more visually detailed environment compared to previous games, a new 2-on-2 Pokémon battling mechanic, a special ability system applying to each Pokémon in battle, the [[Pokémon Contest]] sub-game, and the new region of [[Hoenn]]. However, this generation also garnered some criticism for leaving out several gameplay features, including the day-and-night system introduced in the previous generation, and it was also the first installment that encouraged the player to collect merely a selected assortment of the total number of Pokémon rather than every existing species (202 out of 386 species are catchable in the ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'' versions). Third-generation spin-off titles include ''[[Pokémon Pinball: Ruby and Sapphire]]'' for Game Boy Advance; ''[[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon]]'' for Game Boy Advance and [[Nintendo DS]]; ''[[Pokémon Dash]]'', ''[[Pokémon Trozei!]]'' and ''[[Pokémon Ranger]]'' for Nintendo DS; ''[[Pokémon Channel]]'' and ''[[Pokémon Box]]'' for Nintendo GameCube; and a separate RPG series for Nintendo GameCube, consisting of the games ''[[Pokémon Colosseum]]'' and ''[[Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness]]''.

New gameplay concepts include a restructured [[Pokémon moves|move]]-classification system, online multiplayer trading and battling via [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]], the return (and expansion) of the second generation's day-and-night system, the expansion of the third generation's Pokémon Contests into "Super Contests," and the new region of [[Sinnoh]], which has an underground component for multiplayer gameplay in addition to the main overworld. Currently, spin-off titles in the fourth generation include the ''Pokémon Stadium'' follow-up ''[[Pokémon Battle Revolution]]'' for [[Wii]] (which will have Wi-Fi connectivity as well<ref>"[http://www.cubed3.com/news/5349 Cubed3 Pokémon Battle Revolution Confirmed for Wii]" ''Cubed3.com''.

===Starter Pokémon===
One of the consistent aspects of most [[Pokémon video games|''Pokémon'' games]] – spanning from [[Pokémon Red and Blue|''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'']] on the [[Game Boy line|Nintendo Game Boy]] to the [[Nintendo DS]] game, [[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl|''Pokémon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']] – is the choice of one of three different Pokémon at the start of the player's adventures; these three are often labeled "starter Pokémon."  Players can choose a [[Pokémon type#Grass-type|Grass-type]], a [[Pokémon type#Fire-type|Fire-type]], or a [[Pokémon type#Water-type|Water-type]], Pokémon indigenous to that particular region.<ref name=spy> [http://uk.gba.gamespy.com/gameboy-advance/pokemon-ruby-version/498107p1.html ''Pokémon Ruby'' review (page 1)] ''Gamespy.com''.

===Pokédex===
{{Main|Pokédex}}
The [[Pokédex]] is a fictional electronic device featured in the ''Pokémon'' [[video game]] and [[Pokémon (anime)|anime]] series. In the games, whenever a Pokémon is first captured, its data will be added to a player's Pokédex, but in the anime or [[Pokémon Adventures|manga]], the Pokédex is a comprehensive electronic reference encyclopedia, usually referred to in order to deliver [[Exposition (plot device)|exposition]]. "Pokédex" is also used to refer to a list of Pokémon, usually a list of Pokémon by number.

In the video games, a [[Pokémon Trainer]] is issued a blank device at the start of their journey. A trainer must then attempt to fill the Pokédex by encountering and at least briefly obtaining each of the various different species of Pokémon. A player will receive the name and image of a Pokémon after encountering one that was not previously in the Pokédex, typically after battling said Pokémon, either in the wild or in a trainer battle (with the exceptions of link battles and tournament battles, such as in the [[Pokémon Emerald#Battle Frontier|Battle Frontier]]). More detailed information is available after the player obtains a member of the species, either through capturing the Pokémon in the wild, evolving a previously captured Pokémon, hatching a Pokémon egg (from the second generation onwards), or through a trade with another trainer (either an NPC or another player). This information includes height, weight, species type, and a short description of the Pokémon. Later versions of the Pokédex have more detailed information, like the size of a certain Pokémon compared to the player character, or Pokémon being sorted by their habitat (so far, the latter feature is only in the ''FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen''  versions). The [[GameCube]] games, [[Pokémon Colosseum]] and [[Pokémon XD]], have a Pokémon Digital Assistant (P{{Unicode|&#x2605;}}DA) which is similar to the Pokédex, but also tells what types are effective against a Pokémon and gives a description of its abilities.

===Anime series===
{{Main|Pokémon (anime)}}
[[Image:Kantogroup.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Screenshot of ''Pokémon'' anime. From left to right: Brock, May, Max, Misty, Ash and Pikachu.]]
The ''Pokémon'' anime [[Television program|series]] and [[film]]s are a meta-series of adventures separate from the [[canon (fiction)|canon]] that most of the ''Pokémon'' video games follow (with the exception of ''[[Pokémon Yellow]]'', a game based on the anime storyline).  The anime follows the quest of the main character, [[Ash Ketchum]]<ref name=ash> [http://www.psypokes.com/anime/index.php ''Pokémon'' anime overview] ''Psypokes.com''. URL Accessed [[May 25]], [[2006]].</ref>, a Pokémon Master in training, as he and a small group of friends<ref name=ash/> travel around the fictitious world of Pokémon along with their various Pokémon partners. 

The original series, titled ''Pocket Monsters'', or simply ''Pokémon'' in western countries (often referred to as ''Pokémon: Gotta Catch Em All'' to distinguish it from the later series), begins with Ash's first day as a Pokémon trainer. His first (and signature) Pokémon is a [[Pikachu]], differing from the games, where only [[Bulbasaur]], [[Charmander]] or [[Squirtle]] could be chosen.<ref> ''Pokémon 10th Anniversary, Vol. 1 - Pikachu'', Viz Video., [[June 6]], [[2006]]. {{ASIN|B000F4PDE4}}.</ref>  The series follows the storyline of the original games, [[Pokémon Red and Blue|''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'']], in the region of [[Kanto (Pokémon)|Kanto]]. Accompanying Ash on his journeys are [[Brock (Pokémon)|Brock]], the [[List of Kanto locations#Pewter City|Pewter City]] Gym Leader, and [[Misty (Pokémon)|Misty]], the youngest of the Gym Leader sisters from [[List of Kanto locations#Cerulean City|Cerulean City]].

''Pokémon: Adventures in the Orange Islands'' follows Ash's adventures in the Orange Islands, a place unique to the anime, and replaces Brock with [[Tracey Sketchit]], an artist and "Pokémon watcher." The next series, based on the second generation of games, include ''Pokémon: Johto Journeys'', ''Pokémon: Johto League Champions'', and ''Pokémon: Master Quest'', following the original trio of Ash, Brock, and Misty in the western [[Johto]] region.

[[Image:Pokémon episode 1 screenshot.png|thumb|left|Ash Ketchum and Pikachu together in the pilot episode, [[Pokémon, I Choose You!|Pokémon, I Choose You!]] ]]

The saga continues in ''Pokémon: Advanced'', ''Pokémon: Advanced Challenge'', and ''Pokémon: Advanced Battle'', based on the third generation games. Ash and company travel to [[Hoenn]], a southern region in the Pokémon World. Ash takes on the role of a teacher and mentor for a novice Pokémon trainer named [[May (Pokémon)|May]]. Her brother [[Max (Pokémon)|Max]] accompanies them, and though he isn't a trainer, he knows large amounts of handy information. Brock (from the original series) soon catches up with Ash, but Misty has returned to Cerulean City to tend to her duties as a gym leader. (Misty, along with other recurring characters, appears in the spin-off series ''[[Pokémon Chronicles]]''.) The Advanced Generation concludes with the ''Battle Frontier'' saga, based off the ''Emerald'' version and including aspects of ''FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen''.

The most recent series is the ''Diamond and Pearl'' series, with Max leaving to pick his starter Pokémon, and May going to the Grand Festival in Johto. Ash, Brock and a new companion named [[Dawn (Pokémon)|Dawn]] travel through the region of [[Sinnoh]]. The series is set for release in the US in a special hour block on the 20th of April.

===Pokémon Trading Card Game===  	 
{{main|Pokémon Trading Card Game}} 	 
[[Image:DP01 011 Palkia.jpg|right|150px|thumb|[[Palkia]], the Spatial Pokémon ''Trading Card Game'' card from ''Pokémon TCG Diamond and Pearl''.]] 	 
The ''[[Pokémon (card game)|Pokémon Trading Card Game]]'' is a [[collectible card game]] similar in goal to a Pokémon battle in the video game series. Players use Pokémon cards, with individual strengths and weaknesses, in an attempt to defeat their opponent by "knocking out" his or her Pokémon cards.<ref> [http://www.pokemon-tcg.com/p_strategy/rulebooks/book_68.jsp#433 ''Pokémon Trading Card Game'' "How to play" guide] ''Pokemon-tcg.com''.

The game was first published in [[North America]] by [[Wizards of the Coast]] in 1999.<ref name=wiz> [http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=company/pr/20030312b ''Pokemon Trading Card Game'' News; "Pokémon Ruby & Sapphire TCG Releases"] ''Wizards.com''.

Nintendo discontinued its production of e-Reader compatible cards with the release of EX FireRed & LeafGreen. 
 
In 1998, Nintendo released a [[Game Boy Color]] version of the trading card game in Japan. It was also released in the US and Europe in 2000. [[Pokémon Trading Card Game (video game)|This game]] included digital versions cards from the original set of cards and the first two expansions (Jungle and Fossil), but also included several cards exclusive to the game. A sequel to this game exists, but was not released outside of Japan.

==Criticism==
{{main|Criticism of Pokémon}}

===Racism===
[[image:original Jynx design.png|thumb|right|The original black-skinned Jynx design and source of the controversy.]]
This original design of the Pokémon [[Jynx (Pokémon)|Jynx]] (seen to the right) bore a striking, but possibly coincidental, resemblance to entertainers in [[blackface]]. A strong case can be made for Jynx being a [[parody]] of or [[homage]] to the Japanese [[Ganguro]] and [[Yamanba]] fashion trends, which were extremely popular when Pokémon was first released. Blackface-influenced characters have appeared elsewhere in anime and manga - examples can be found near the beginning of [[Osamu Tezuka]]'s early [[graphic novel]], ''Metropolis'' and also can be found with [[Dragon Ball Z]]'s [[Mr. Popo]].

As Pokémon became more popular in the United States, this perceived similarity to a racist image from the United States' past offended some. In particular, it offended children's book author [[Carole Boston Weatherford]], who accused Jynx of being a racist stereotype in an article titled "Politically Incorrect Pokémon" in the magazine ''Black World Today'', shortly after the anime episode ''Holiday Hi-Jynx'' aired.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} As a result, [[Banned episodes of Pokémon#Kōri no Dōkutsu!|later episodes]] of the anime which feature Jynx were either banned or edited in the United States.

In 2002, in response to this controversy, Nintendo changed Jynx's face from black to purple and its hands from blue to purple in the video game series, a change which would be reflected in the anime three years later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dogasu.bulbagarden.net/bashing/racist_jynx_01.html|title=Pokémon... Racist?|last=Bulbagarden|date=2007-04-23}}</ref>
===Religion===
Pokémon has been criticized by members of both the Christian and Jewish religions.

After the US release of ''Pokémon Yellow'', a sudden widespread criticism of it passed through Christian congregations primarily by word-of-mouth. Some Christian groups in the United States believe Pokémon to be Satanic in origin, although the topic of religion was never mentioned or referenced in any episode of the anime. Claimed parallels between Pokémon and Satanism include the capturing and invoking of Pokémon to perform tasks, similar to [[demon]]s; the concept of Pokémon "evolution," which denies some forms of biblical interpretation; and certain abilities of Pokémon, such as psychic or elemental powers, not stated to derive from God. There are also allegations against ''Pokémon'' citing liberal views on morality. For example, [[Team Rocket (anime)#James|James]], a character on the anime show, frequently dresses as a woman to disguise himself, giving some the impression that he is a [[transvestite]].

The ''Pokémon Trading Card Game'' has been criticized by members of the Jewish community for its use of the [[swastika]], though Nintendo says that this is a matter of cultural misunderstanding, as the swastika and a similar symbol, the manji, have been used in East Asian cultures as a symbol for “good fortune” by the Hindu religion for thousands of years. The manji was shown only on a Japanese version card and was excluded from the North American release. However, these Jewish groups attacked the Japanese version distributed in the U.S. by unauthorized import. As a result of this controversy Nintendo stopped using this symbol even in the Japanese version.

===Health===<!-- THE SEIZURES WERE CAUSED BY '''FLASHING''' RED IMAGES, STILLS WILL NOT BLIND PEOPLE!-->
{{main|Banned episodes of Pokémon#Dennō Senshi Porygon|l1=Banned episodes of Pokémon}}
[[Image:Pikachu seizure-2.jpg|right|thumb|One frame of the scene that caused the seizures.]]
On [[December 16]], [[1997]], more than 635 Japanese children were admitted to hospitals with convulsive [[Seizure|epileptic seizures]]. It was determined that the seizures were caused by watching an episode of Pokémon, "''[[Banned episodes of Pokémon#Dennō Senshi Porygon|Dennō Senshi Porygon]]''," (most commonly translated "Electric Soldier Porygon", season 1, episode 43); as a result, this episode has not been aired since. In this particular episode, there were bright explosions with rapidly-alternating blue and red color patterns.<ref>[http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/pokemon.html Pokemon packs a punch] URL accessed [[January 7]], [[2007]].</ref> It was determined in subsequent research that these strobing light effects cause some individuals to have epileptic seizures, even if the person had no previous history of [[epilepsy]]. As a consequence, many publishers (including [[Nintendo]]) added warning labels to their [[video game]] products (or made pre-existing labels more prominent), warning that exposure to video games may trigger seizures in individuals vulnerable to [[photosensitive epilepsy]].

This incident is the most common focus of Pokémon-related parodies in other media, and was lampooned by ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Thirty Minutes over Tokyo]]"<ref> "[http://web.archive.org/web/20041108175456/http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1999/06/990601080722.htm Color Changes in TV Cartoons Cause Seizures]," ''ScienceDaily'' ([[Waybacked]], [[Cascading Style Sheets|Style Sheet(s)]] missing).</ref> and the ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[Chinpokomon]]," among others.

==Cultural influence==
A live action show called [[Pokémon Live!]] toured the United States in late [[2000]]. It was based on the popular [[Pokémon (anime)|Pokémon anime]], but had some continuity errors relating to it. In late [[2002]], it was scheduled to tour Europe, but was canceled for unknown reasons, possibly due to lack of interest. These problems may have occurred because Europe did not fully partake in the spreading culture of the Pokėmon's influences, thus rendering Pokėmon Live not as much of a "hit" that was planned. 

''Pokémon'', being a popular franchise, has undoubtedly left its mark on [[pop-culture]]. The ''Pokémon'' characters themselves have become pop-culture icons; examples include not one, but two different [[Pikachu]] balloons in the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]], a [[:Image:ana.b747.pokemon.arp.750pix.jpg|Pokémon-styled]] [[Boeing 747-400]], thousands of merchandise items, and a [[Poképark|theme park]] in [[Nagoya, Aichi|Nagoya, Japan]] in 2005 and [[Taipei]] in 2006. Pokémon also appeared on the cover of [[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]] in 1999. The Comedy Central show ''[[Drawn Together]]'' has a character named [[Ling-Ling]] which is a direct parody of Pikachu. Several other shows such as ''[[ReBoot]]'', ''[[Thirty Minutes over Tokyo|The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Chinpokomon|South Park]]'' and ''[[All Grown Up!]]'' have made references and spoofs of ''Pokémon'', among other series. Pokémon was also featured on [[Vh1]]'s ''[[I Love the '90s]]''.
