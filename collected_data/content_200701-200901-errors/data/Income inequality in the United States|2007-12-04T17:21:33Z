'''Income inequality in the United States''' refers to the extent to which [[Income in the United States|income]], most commonly measured by [[Household income in the United States|household]] or [[Personal income in the United States|individual]], is distributed in an uneven manner. While there seems to be [[consensus]] among social scientists that some degree of [[income inequality]] is needed, the extent of income inequality and its implications on society continue to be a subject of great debate, as they have been for over a century.<ref name="Porty, R.

{{main|Household income in the United States}}

Inflation adjusted income data from the Census Bureau shows that household income has increased substantially for all demographics, with larger gains experienced by those with higher incomes. The emergence of dual-earner households has had a substantial impact on increasing household income, especially among households in the upper 20%. Along with the entrance of women into the labor force, the discrepancy between those households with one and those with multiple earners was amplified significantly.<ref name="Gilbert, D. (2002). ''The American Class Structure: In An Age of Growing Inequality''. Belmost, CA: Wadsworth."/> As of 2005, 42% of all U.S. households and 76% of those in the top quintile had two or more [[Income earner|income earners]].<ref name="US Census Bureau. (2006).

Household income quintiles and top 5%.|accessdate=2007-06-20}}</ref> Income rose considerably faster in the higher regions of the household income strata. Between 1967 income increase experienced for the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile, the lower threshold for the upper 5%, was 555.73% as large as the increase in [[median income]], which in turn was 150.63% as large as the increase in income for the 20<sup>th</sup> percentile. While the percentage of household with two or more income earners varied greatly across these three demographics, it is nearly identical for the 80<sup>th</sup> and 95<sup>th</sup> percentile. In 2003 a household in the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile earned 77.2% more than a household in the 80<sup>th</sup> percentile, compared to 60.5% in 1967, a 27.6% increase in the earnings increase discrepancy between the two groups. Overall the income of the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile grew 15.2% faster than that of the 80<sup>th</sup>, 146.8% faster than that of the median and 159.9% faster than that of the 20<sup>th</sup> percentile.<ref name="DeNavas, C., Proctor, B.

{{main|Personal Income in the United States}}
Personal income represents the earnings of individuals and, therefore, directly reflects occupational status, achievement and educational attainment. While many, though not the majority, of income earners reside in households with more than one income earner, trends in personal income are more indicative of the job market and the economy than household income. Personal income has risen considerably since 1953, especially for female workers. For male workers, however, income stagnated during the 1970s and 1980s, increasing substantially during the 1990s and then stagnating once more since 2000.<ref name="US Census Bureau. (2006).

{{see|Gini coefficient}}
To date, one of the most commonly used measure of income inequality is the Gini index. The Gini coefficient measures income inequality on a scale from 0 to 1, based on the [[Lorenz Curve]]. On this scale 0 represents perfect equality with everyone having the exact same income and 1 represents perfect inequality with one person having all income (Scores are then commonly multiplied by 100 to make them easier to understand).<ref name="Schiller, B.

Income inequality has many causes, some of which remain unknown and others which remain disputed. All societies feature some income inequality as the positions people hold in these societies vary in responsibility, importance and complexity. In order to provide sufficient incentive for a wide variety of occupations to be filled with motivated incumbents societies need to provide a variety of rewards.<ref name="Rhonda, L. (1998).

As scarcity creates value, the increased acquisition and subsequent possession of expertise and skill certified through an academic degree increases compensation including income.

More and more employers now require workers to possess greater amounts of expertise than they did a generation ago while the manufacturing sector which employed many of those lacking a post-secondary education is decreasing in size.<ref name="Zweig, M.

Ithica, NY: Cornell University Press.</ref> As a result the scarce intellectual skills transferred through post-secondary education curricula have become increasingly important. Thus, income differences between the varying levels of educational attainment were increasing. The resulting economic job market may be referred to as constituting a "two-tier" labor market. In this market the income discrepancy between the [[American middle class#The professional/managerial middle class|professional]] and [[American middle class#Working class majority|working class]] may be growing. Sociologists such as Dennis Gilbert refer to the professional class as a privileged [[Social class in the United States|class]] due its favorable disposition in the two-tier labor market.<ref name="Gilbert, D.

In other words, higher educational attainment translates into higher personal income levels and larger income increases over time.

While the returns to education increased considerably in the United States since the 1980s, it has not increased as much in many European countries such as Germany, France or the United Kingdom (Freeman, Richard B. and Lawrence F. Katz, editors Differences and Changes in Wage Structures. National Bureau of Economic Research. Comparative Labor Markets Series. The University of Chicago Press, 1995). The reasons for this discrepancy in inequality trends between Europe and the United States is still the subject of much debate but recent work suggests that tight regulations of labor markets in Europe could have prevented the returns to education from rising there as much as in the United States, but at the expense of creating unemployment (Fernández-Kranz, Daniel, “Why has wage inequality increased more in the United States than in Europe: an empirical investigation of the demand and supply of skill,” Applied Economics, Vol. 38, April 2006).
