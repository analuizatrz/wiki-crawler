'''Super Typhoon Paka''' ('''Super Typhoon Rubing''' [[PAGASA]]) was an extraordinarily powerful [[tropical cyclone]] that caused extensive damage in the southern [[Mariana Islands]] (including [[Guam]]) in December of [[1997]].

Paka is the [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] name for Pat.<ref name="cphc">{{cite web|author=Benjamin C. Hablutzel, Hans E. Rosendal,

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Paka 1997 track.png}}
As the weather synoptics of the northern [[Pacific Ocean]] transitioned into a late-fall to early winter-type pattern, [[convection]] from the [[monsoon trough]] extended to the east of the [[International Date Line]]. During late November, an equatorial westerly wind system developed into twin [[trough (meteorology)|trough]]s on opposite sides of the [[equator]]; the one in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] ultimately developed into [[1997-98 South Pacific cyclone season#Tropical Storm Pam|Tropical Storm Pam]], while the one in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] formed into an area of convection about 2000&nbsp;km (1240&nbsp;mi) southwest of [[Hawaii]]. The disturbance gradually organized as it drifted north-northeastward, and on [[November 28]] it developed into Tropical Depression Five-C about 465&nbsp;km (290&nbsp;mi) west-northwest of [[Palmyra Atoll]]. Operationally, the [[Central Pacific Hurricane Center]] (CPHC) did not begin issuing warnings on the system until [[December 2]].<ref name="summary">{{cite web|author=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|year=1999|title=Summary of Western North Pacific and North Indian Ocean Tropical Cyclones|accessdate=2007-04-29|url=https://metocph.nmci.navy.mil/jtwc/atcr/1997atcr/ch3/chap3.htm}}</ref><ref name="pakatcr">{{cite web|author=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|year=1999|title=Super Typhoon Paka (05C) ATCR|accessdate=2007-04-29|url=https://metocph.nmci.navy.mil/jtwc/atcr/1997atcr/ch3/05cw.htm}}</ref><ref name="epachurdat">{{cite web|author=Hurricane Research Division|year=2007|title=Eastern North Pacific Tracks File 1949-2006|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=2007-04-29|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/tracks1949to2006_epa.txt}}</ref><ref name="cphc"/> 

The tropical depression continued drifting north-northeastward, and initially failed to strengthen significantly. It turned to the west on [[December 1]], due to the presence of a strong [[anticyclone]] to its north with a [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] extending westward past the [[International Date Line]]. On [[December 2]], based on satellite estimates, the CPHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Paka while located about 1000&nbsp;km (625&nbsp;mi) south-southeast of [[Johnston Atoll]]. Due to the presence of high [[cloud]]s across the area, forecasters had difficulty at times in locating the low-level circulation. After becoming a tropical storm, Paka remained nearly stationary for about 2 days before resuming a slow motion to the west-southwest. It steadily intensified due to warm water temperatures, and from [[December 3]] through the following day, the storm attained winds of 105&nbsp;km/h (65&nbsp;mph) before encountering dry air and weakening. By [[December 6]], the winds had decreased to minimal tropical storm status for about 12 hours. Subsequently, Paka began to re-intensity, and on [[December 7]] the storm crossed the [[International Date Line]] into the western North Pacific Ocean with winds of 80&nbsp;km/h (50&nbsp;mph).<ref name="epachurdat"/><ref name="cphc"/>

Upon entering the western North Pacific Ocean, tropical cyclone warning duties transferred from the CPHC to the [[Japan Meteorological Agency]] (JMA), and the JMA first assessed Paka as a 65&nbsp;km (40&nbsp;mph <small>10-min sustained</small>) storm.<ref name="jma">{{cite web|author=Japan Meteorological Agency|year=1997|title=Best Track of the 1997 Pacific Typhoon Season|accessdate=2007-04-29|url=http://www.jma.go.jp/jma/jma-eng/jma-center/rsmc-hp-pub-eg/Besttracks/bst1997.txt}}</ref> The [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) unofficially assumed warning duties for interests in the [[United States Department of Defense]], as well. Paka continued to intensify after crossing the date line, and from late on [[December 7]] through early the following day the storm maintained winds of 115&nbsp;km/h (70&nbsp;mph <small>1-min sustained</small>), according to analysis by JTWC. However, upper-level [[wind shear]] increased shortly thereafter, and it again weakened. At 1200&nbsp;UTC on [[December 9]], the JTWC assessed Paka as a 85&nbsp;km/h (50&nbsp;mph) tropical storm, and forecasted it to continue weakening due to [[surface weather analysis]] indicating strong wind shear would remain. By [[December 10]], the shear had begun to decrease as the storm moved through the [[Marshall Islands]], and that night night the JTWC upgraded Paka to typhoon status.<ref name="pakatcr"/> Paka was officially upgraded to typhoon status when JMA classified it with winds of 120&nbsp;km/h (75&nbsp;mph <small>10-min sustained</small>) at 0000&nbsp;UTC on [[December 11]].<ref name="jma"/>

After attaining typhoon status, Paka strengthened fairly quickly, and by [[December 12]] the typhoon reached an intensity of 150&nbsp;km/h (90&nbsp;mph <small>10-min sustained</small>)<ref name="jma"/>, or 215&nbsp;km/h (135&nbsp;mph <small>1-min sustained</small>). Subsequently, it briefly weakened as its forward motion increased, and at 0600&nbsp;UTC on [[December 13]] JTWC classified the typhoon with winds of 175&nbsp;km/h (110&nbsp;mph <small>1-min sustained</small>). However, Paka again re-intensified, and at 1200&nbsp;UTC on [[December 14]] it attained the unofficial ranking of Super Typhoon status while over the open Pacific Ocean.<ref name="pakatcr"/> Additionally, JMA classified it with 10-min sustained winds of 175&nbsp;km/h (110&nbsp;mph).<ref name="jma"/> After reaching an initial peak intensity of 260&nbsp;km/h (160&nbsp;mph <small>1-min sustained</small>) on [[December 15]], Typhoon Paka began to weaken as it approached the southern [[Mariana Islands]]; the [[NEXRAD]] [[Doppler radar]] from [[Guam]] revealed the presence of a primary [[eye (cyclone)|eyewall]] of 74&nbsp;km (46&nbsp;mi) in diameter, with a fragmented inner wall cloud of 19&nbsp;km (11&nbsp;mi) in diameter.<ref name="pakatcr"/> Additionally, satellite imagery indicated an [[eye (cyclone)|Eyewall mesovorticy]] within the eye of the typhoon.<ref name="gp1297">{{cite web|author=Gary Padgett|year=1998|title=Monthly Tropical Cyclone Summary, December 1997|accessdate=2007-04-30|url=http://australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/1998/summ9712.txt}}</ref> It slowed and began to re-intensify as it continued westward, and at 0530&nbsp;UTC on [[December 16]] the northern portion of the outer eyewall of Paka passed over the island of [[Rota (island)|Rota]]; 20 minutes later, the southern portion of the inner wall cloud moved across northern [[Guam]]. At around 1200&nbsp;UTC, the center of Paka passed about 28&nbsp;km (17&nbsp;mi) north of [[Hagåtña, Guam|Hagåtña]], the closest point of approach to Guam.<ref name="pakatcr"/> 

Typhoon Paka continued to steadily intensify after passing the Marianas Islands, and late on [[December 17]] it reached its peak intensity of 185&nbsp;km/h (115&nbsp;mph <small>10-min sustained</small>) while located 440&nbsp;km (275&nbsp;mi) west-northwest of Guam.<ref name="jma"/> Early on [[December 18]], the JTWC assessed it as attaining peak winds of 295&nbsp;km/h (185&nbsp;mph <small>1-min winds</small>).<ref name="pakatcr"/> On [[December 19]], it entered the area of responsibility of the [[Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration]], or PAGASA, and was named Rubing.<ref name="wmo905">{{cite web|author=The United Nations Task Force on El Niño, et. al|year=1999|title=The 1997-1998 El Niño Event: A Scientific and Technical Retrospect|publisher=World Meteorological Organization|accessdate=2007-04-19|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20060311135947/http://www.wmo.ch/nino/WMO905-e.pdf}}</ref> Shortly thereafter, Paka moved through an area of progressively increasing [[wind shear]], which resulted in a steady weakening trend.<ref name="gp1297"/> By [[December 21]], winds decreased to tropical storm status. The next day, it degenerated into a tropical depression, and on [[December 23]] JMA classified Paka as dissipated.<ref name="jma"/>

==Impact==
===Marshall Islands===
While tracking through the [[Marshall islands]] as a tropical storm, Paka produced wind gusts in excess of 75&nbsp;km/h (45&nbsp;mph) on the [[Majuro]] and [[Kwajalein]] atolls.<ref name="pakatcr"/>

===Rota===
Because the typhoon was intensifying while passing to the south of the island, the first wind, or northeast through east winds, were less severe than the second wind from the southeast.<ref name="pakatcr"/>

===Guam===
Paka moved into the Rota Channel on [[December 16]], packing winds between 100 and 150 mph and the eye passed near [[Andersen Air Force Base]].<ref name="Pakadamage">{{

}}</ref> Sea heights reached 35 feet above normal. Approximately 1500 structures were destroyed, many of those residential. Another 10,000 were damaged and about 5000 people were left homeless. Loss of life on Guam was minimized due to a wide use of reinforced concrete in residential construction, strict building codes, and public shelters for those without adequate homes.  Infrastructure and property damage, however, was catastrophic. The complete structural collapses were limited to light-metal and wood frame construction.<ref name="Pakadamage"/>

A gust caused by Super Typhoon Paka over Guam was recorded at 236 mph (380 km/h); however, this reading had to be discarded, since the [[anemometer]] was damaged by the storm. Had it been confirmed, this would be the strongest non-tornadic wind ever recorded at the [[Earth]]'s surface. (The current record is held by a non-hurricane wind registering 231 mph (372 km/h) at [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington]] in [[New Hampshire]].) <ref name="Guam">[http://www.guam.navy.mil/weather/metoc/INDEX.htm U.S. NAVAL FORCES MARIANAS]</ref> 

==Aftermath==
On [[December 17]], [[1997]], [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] declared [[Guam]] a federal disaster area, making it eligible for federal assistance.<ref name="1217fem">{{cite web|author=FEMA|year=1997|title=Guam Typhoon Paka|accessdate=2007-05-01|url=http://www.fema.gov/news/event.fema?id=645}}</ref> One week later, a disaster declaration was ordered for the [[Northern Mariana Islands]].<ref name="1224fem">{{cite web|author=FEMA|year=1997|title=Northern Mariana Islands Typhoon|accessdate=2007-05-01|url=http://www.fema.gov/news/event.fema?id=4443}}</ref> Ultimately, [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]] received 14,770 Individual Assistance Applications from residents on Guam.
