==Life and music career==
===Childhood and early beginnings===


The youngest of fourteen children born to Adhémar Dion and [[Thérèse Dion|Thérèse Tanguay]] both of [[French Canadian]] descent. Céline Dion was raised a [[Roman Catholic]] in a poverty-stricken, but, by her own account, happy home in Charlemagne, Quebec, Canada.<ref name="autogenerated12">"Profiles of Celine Dion, Enrique Iglesias, Moby." Paula Zahn, Charles Molineaux, Gail O'Neill. ''[[People in the News]]''. May 18, 2002.

From an early age Dion had dreamed of being a performer.<ref name=Time1>Alexander, Charles P. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,980285,00.html The Power of Celine Dion]". ''[[Time (Magazine)|Time]]''. March 7, 1994.

At age twelve, Dion collaborated with her mother and her brother Jacques to compose her first song, "[[Ce n'était qu'un rêve]]" ("It Was Only a Dream").<ref name="autogenerated12" /> Her brother Michel Dondalinger Dion sent the recording to music manager René Angélil, whose name he discovered on the back of a [[Ginette Reno]] album.<ref name="autogenerated11">[http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Pop_Encyclopedia/D/Dion_Celine.html Celine Dion Biography]. "[[Canadian Online Explorer|Canoe Jam!]]." Retrieved September 13, 2007</ref> Angélil was moved to tears by Dion's voice, and decided to make her a star.<ref name="autogenerated12" /> He mortgaged his home to fund her first record, ''[[La voix du bon Dieu]]'' (a play on words "The Voice of God/The Way of God", 1981), which became a local number-one record and made Dion an instant star in Quebec. Her popularity spread to other parts of the world when she competed in the 1982 Yamaha World Popular Song Festival in [[Tokyo]], Japan, and won the musician's award for "Top Performer" as well as the gold medal for "Best Song" with "[[Tellement j'ai d'amour pour toi]]" ("I Have So Much Love for You").<ref name="autogenerated11" />

By 1983, in addition to becoming the first Canadian artist to receive a gold record in France for the single "[[D'amour ou d'amitié]]" ("Of Love or of Friendship"), Dion had also won several [[Félix Award]]s, including "Best Female performer" and "Discovery of the Year".<ref name="autogenerated20" /><ref name="autogenerated11" /> Further success in Europe, Asia, and Australia came when Dion represented [[Switzerland]] in the [[1988 Eurovision Song Contest]] with the song "[[Ne partez pas sans moi]]" ("Don't Go Without Me") and won the contest by a close margin in [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Connor |first=John Kennedy |title=The Eurovision Song Contest - The Official History |authorlink=John Kennedy O'Connor |publisher=Carlton Books |location=UK |date=2007-04-02}} ISBN 978-1844429943.</ref> However, American success was yet to come, partly because she was exclusively a Francophone artist.<ref name="autogenerated18">Alexander, Charles P.

Two years after she had learned English, Dion made her debut into the Anglophone market with ''[[Unison (album)|Unison]]'' (1990).<ref name="autogenerated11"/> She incorporated the help of many established musicians, including Vito Luprano and Canadian [[music producer|producer]] [[David Foster]].<ref name=Time1>Alexander, Charles P. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,980285,00.html The Power of Celine Dion]". ''[[Time (Magazine)|Time]]''. March 7, 1994.</ref> The album was largely influenced by 1980s [[soft rock]] music that quickly found a niche within the [[adult contemporary]] radio format. ''Unison'' also hit the right notes with critics: Jim Faber of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote that Dion's vocals were "tastefully unadorned", and that she never attempted to "bring off styles that are beyond her".<ref>{{cite web | title=Entertainment Weekly | work=Review--Céline Dion Unison | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/review/music/0,6115,313100_4_0_,00.html| accessmonthday=November 18 | accessyear=2005}}</ref> Stephen Erlewine of ''[[Allmusic]]'' declared it as, "a fine, sophisticated American debut."<ref>{{cite web | title=Allmusic | work=Review--Céline Dion Unison | url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&token=&sql=10:6227gjlrj6in | accessmonthday=November 18 | accessyear=2005}}</ref> Singles from the album included "[[(If There Was) Any Other Way]]", "[[The Last to Know]]", "[[Unison (song)#Céline Dion version)|Unison]]", and "[[Where Does My Heart Beat Now]]", a mid-tempo soft-rock ballad which made prominent use of the [[electric guitar]]. The latter became her first single to reach the top 10 on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], peaking at number four. The album established Dion as a rising singer in the United States, and across [[Continental Europe]] and Asia.

In 1991, Dion was also a soloist in "[[Voices That Care]]", a tribute to American troops fighting in [[Operation Desert Storm]]. Dion's real international breakthrough came when she duetted with [[Peabo Bryson]] on the title track to [[Disney]]'s animated film ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1991).<ref name=Bliss>Bliss, Karen. "25 Years of Canadian Artists." ''Canadian Musician''. March 1, 2004. pg. 34. ISSN: 07089635</ref> The song captured a musical style that Dion would utilize in the future: sweeping, classically influenced ballads with soft instrumentation. Both a critical and commercial hit, the song became her second U.S. top ten single, and won the [[Academy Award]] for [[Best Song]], and the [[Grammy Award]] for [[Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]].<ref name="autogenerated3">Alexander, Charles P.

"[[Beauty and the Beast (Disney song)|Beauty and the Beast]]" was featured on Dion's 1992 [[Celine Dion (album)|self-titled album]], which, like her debut, had a strong rock influence combined with elements of soul and classical music. Owing to the success of the lead-off single and her collaboration with Foster and [[Diane Warren]], the album was as well received as ''Unison''. Other singles that achieved moderate success included "[[If You Asked Me To#Céline Dion version|If You Asked Me To]]" (a [[Cover version|cover]] of [[Patti LaBelle]]'s song from the 1989 movie ''[[Licence to Kill]]'') which peaked at number four on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], the gospel-tinged "[[Love Can Move Mountains]]", and "[[Nothing Broken But My Heart]]". As with Dion's earlier releases, the album had an overtone of love. Also during this time, Dion released the Francophone album ''[[Dion chante Plamondon]]'' (1991). The album consisted mostly of covers, but included 4 new songs, which included "[[Des mots qui sonnent (song)|Des mots qui sonnent]]," "[[Je danse dans ma tête]]," "[[Quelqu'un que j'aime, quelqu'un qui m'aime]]" and "[[L'amour existe encore]]". It was originally released in Canada and France during the 1991–1992 period, but then got an international release in 1994, the first French Celine Dion album to do so. "[[Un garçon pas comme les autres (Ziggy)]]" became a smash hit in France, reaching number 2 and being certified gold. In Quebec, the album was certified Gold the day it was released. To date, ''Dion chante Plamondon'' has sold 1.5 million records worldwide.

By 1992 ''Unison'', ''Céline Dion'', and media appearances had propelled Dion to superstardom in North America. She had achieved one of her main objectives: wedging her way into the Anglophone market and achieving fame.<ref name="autogenerated18"/> However, while she was experiencing rising success in the U.S., her French fans in Canada criticized her for neglecting them.<ref name="autogenerated21">"Celine Dion."

Gale Research, 1995.</ref><ref name="autogenerated3" /> She would later regain her fan base at the [[Félix Award]] show, where, after winning "English Artist of the Year", she openly refused to accept the award. She asserted that she was—and would always be—a French, not an English, artist.<ref>{{cite web | title=Céline Dion | work=Céline Dion Biography | url=http://www.celinedionweb.com/celine-dion/en,biography.html| accessmonthday=April 26 | accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref name= Enc>{{cite web | title=The Canadian Encyclopedia | work=Céline Dion Biography | url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=U1ARTU0000970

However, the relationship was kept a secret as they both feared that the public would find their relations inappropriate.<ref name="autogenerated22">"Celine Dion."

===1993–1995: Popularity established===
In 1993, Dion announced her feelings for her manager by declaring him "the colour of [her] love" in the dedication section of her third Anglophone album ''[[The Colour of My Love]]''. However, instead of criticizing their relationship as Dion had feared, fans embraced the couple.<ref name=Time1>Alexander, Charles P.

Retrieved April 9, 2008.</ref> Eventually, Angélil and Dion married in an extravagant wedding ceremony in December 1994, which was broadcast live on Canadian television.

As it was dedicated to her manager, the album's motif focused on love and romance.<ref name="autogenerated23">[http://www.pluggedinonline.com/music/music/a0001109.cfm Celine Dion, ''The Colour of My Love'']. ''Plugged in''. Retrieved September 13, 2007.</ref> It became her most successful record up to that point, selling more than six million copies in the U.S., two million in Canada, and peaking at number-one in many countries. The album also spawned Dion's first U.S., Canadian, and Australian number-one single "[[The Power of Love (Jennifer Rush song)#Céline Dion version|The Power of Love]]" (a remake of [[Jennifer Rush]]'s 1985 hit), which would become her [[signature song|signature hit]] until she reached new career heights in the late 1990s.<ref name="autogenerated18" /> Subsequent singles, such as "[[When I Fall in Love#Céline Dion and Clive Griffin version|When I Fall in Love]]", a [[duet]] with [[Clive Griffin]], and "[[Misled]]" failed to reach the upper tier of the pop charts in the U.S., but were moderately successful in Canada. ''The Colour of My Love'' also became Dion's first major hit in Europe, and in particular the United Kingdom. Both the album and the single "[[Think Twice (song)|Think Twice]]" simultaneously occupied the top of the British charts for five consecutive weeks. "Think Twice", which remained at number one for seven weeks, eventually became the fourth single by a female artist to sell in excess of one million copies in the UK,<ref>{{cite web | title=Celinedion.com| work=The Journey so Far| url=http://www.celinedion.com/celinedion/english/journey3.html | accessmonthday=August 16 | accessyear=2005}}</ref> while the album was eventually certified five-times platinum for two-million copies sold.

Dion kept to her French roots and continued to release many Francophone recordings between each English record.<ref name="autogenerated15">"Celine Dion." Compton's by Britannica. ''Encyclopedia Britannica''. 2005.</ref> Generally, they achieved more credibility than her Anglophone works.<ref name="autogenerated21" /> She released ''[[À l'Olympia]]'', a live album that was recorded during one of Dion's concerts at the [[Paris Olympia|Olympia Theatre]] in [[Paris]], in 1994. It had one promotional single, a live version of "[[Calling You#Céline Dion version|Calling You]]", which peaked at seventy-five on the French Singles Chart. ''[[D'eux]]'' (also known as ''The French Album'' in the United States), was released in 1995, and it would go on to become the best-selling French album of all time.<ref name="autogenerated15" /> The album was mostly written and produced by [[Jean-Jacques Goldman]], and amassed huge success with the singles "[[Pour que tu m'aimes encore]]" and "[[Je sais pas]]". "Pour que tu m'aimes encore" reached the Top ten in the UK, a rare accomplishment for a French song, and "Je sais pas" reached number one on the French Singles Chart. These songs would later become "If That's What It Takes" and "I Don't Know" on Dion's next English album, ''[[Falling into You]]''.

The mid-1990s was a transitional period for Dion's musical style, as she slowly diverged from strong rock influences and transitioned into a more pop and soul style (though the electric guitar remained a central part of her music). Her songs began with more delicate melodies that used softer instrumentations, and built up to strong climaxes, over which her vocals could be displayed.<ref name="autogenerated13">''[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:osr67u50o0jw Allmusic]''.

Compared to her debut, both the quality and sound of Dion's music had also changed significantly. The soft-rock influences on her earlier releases were no longer prominent; they were replaced by more soul/adult contemporary styles. However, the theme of "love" remained in all her releases, and this led to many critics dismissing her work as banal.<ref name="autogenerated24">{{cite web | title= findarticles.com|work =The unsinkable Céline Dion - French-Canadian singer - Interview|url= http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1285/is_3_29/ai_54133689|accessmonthday=December 5 | accessyear=2005}}</ref> In a scathing review of ''Let's Talk About Love'', Rob O'Connor wrote: {{cquote|What never ceases to amaze me is how the trite-est, most cliché-ridden music often takes an assembly-line of lauded music industry professionals to perfect...

===2000–2002: Career break===

===2002–2003: Return to music===
Dion's aptly titled ''[[A New Day Has Come]]'', released in March 2002, ended her three-year break from the music industry. The album was Dion's most personal yet, and established a more mature side of Dion with the songs "[[A New Day Has Come (song)|A New Day Has Come]]", "[[I'm Alive (Celine Dion song)|I'm Alive]]", and "[[Goodbye's (The Saddest Word)]]", a change that resulted from her new-found maternal responsibilities, because, in her own words, "becoming a mother makes you a grown-up."<ref name="autogenerated6">{{cite web| title=VH1 | work= Céline Dion: Let's Talk About Success: The Singer Explains Her Career High-Points| url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/interview/1453531/04222002/dion_celine.jhtml| accessmonthday = December 19 | accessyear= 2005}}</ref> She stated, "''A New Day Has Come'', for Rene, for me, is the baby.

During 2002, she performed for many benefit concerts, including for a second time (the first one was in 1998 at the Beacon Theater, New York, with [[Shania Twain]], [[Gloria Estefan]], [[Carol King]], [[Mariah Carey]], and [[Aretha Franklin]]) the famous VH1 Divas Live, a concert to benefit the VH1 Save The Music Foundation, but in this time in Las Vegas, joining with [[Cher]], [[Anastacia]], [[Dixie Chicks]], [[Mary J. Blige]], [[Whitney Houston]], [[Cyndi Lauper]],  and [[Stevie Nicks]].

[[Image:ImageOHcap5.jpg|thumb|left|The upbeat tempo of "[[One Heart (song)|One Heart]]" and the bright colours and "party" style of the music video were a new direction to Céline Dion's work.]]

Drawing inspiration from personal experiences, Dion released ''[[One Heart]]'' (2003), an album that represented her appreciation for life.<ref>Flick, Larry. ''One Heart''. [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' magazine. New York: March 29, 2003. Vol.115, Iss. 13; pg. 30, 1 pgs</ref> The album largely consisted of dance music—a deviation from the soaring, melodramatic ballads, for which she had once been given mixed reception. Although it achieved moderate success, ''One Heart'' hinted at Dions' inability to overcome the creative wall that she had hit, and words such as "predictable" and "banal" appeared even in the most lenient reviews.<ref>{{cite web | title=Allmusic | work=Review--One Heart| url= http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&token=&sql=10:30dovwnqa9ek| accessmonthday=July 17 | accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref>Durchholz, Daniel.

However, it was dismissed as Dion trying to please her sponsors.<ref>Murray, Sonia. ''Céline Dion's latest takes easy, well-worn route''. The Atlanta Journal–Constitution. Atlanta, Georgia: March 25, 2003. pg. C.1.</ref> By the mid 2000s Dion's music had changed to the point where her releases possessed maternal overtones. ''[[Miracle (Celine Dion album)|Miracle]]'' (2004), a multimedia project conceived by Dion and photographer [[Anne Geddes]], had a theme centering on babies and motherhood. The album was saturated with lullabies and other songs of maternal love and inspiration, the two most popular being covers of [[Louis Armstrong]]'s "[[What a Wonderful World]]" and [[John Lennon]]'s "[[Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy)#Céline Dion version|Beautiful Boy]]". The reviews for ''Miracle'' were generally weak: while [[Charles Taylor]] of ''[[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]]'' magazine wrote that the single "Beautiful Boy" was "an unexpected gem" and called Dion "a timeless, enormously versatile artist",<ref>Taylor, Chuck. ''Céline Dion: "Beautiful Boy"''. ''Billboard''. New York: October 16, 2004. Vol.116, Iss. 42; pg. 33, 1 pgs</ref> Chuck Arnold of ''People'' Magazine labeled the album as excessively sentimental,<ref>Arnold, Chuck. "Review: Celine Dion, Miracle." ''[[People Magazine]].''

The Francophone album ''[[1 fille & 4 types]]'' (''1 Girl & 4 Guys'', 2003), fared better than her first two comebacks, and showed Dion trying to distance herself from the "diva" image. She recruited [[Jean-Jacques Goldman]], Gildas Arzel, Eric Benzi, and Jacques Veneruso, with whom she had previously worked on two of her best selling French albums ''[[S'il suffisait d'aimer]]'' and ''[[D'eux]]''. Labeled "the album of pleasure" by Dion herself, the cover showed Dion in a simple and relaxed manner, contrary to the choreographed poses usually found on her album covers. The album achieved relative critical success: reviewer Stephen Erlwine of ''Allmusic'' wrote that Dion was "getting back to pop basics and performing at a level unheard in a while."<ref>{{cite web | title= Allmusic| work=Review--1 Fille & 4 Types|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&token=&sql=10:5uhqoatawijz|accessmonthday=November 20 |accessyear= 2005}}</ref>

Though her albums were relatively successful, signs of a decline began to appear in the poorer critical reception of ''[[The Collector's Series, Volume One]]'' (2000), and ''One Heart'' (2003). The mass appeal of Dion's later works had declined due to the nature of the themes. Her songs received less airplay as radio became less embracing of balladeers like Dion, Carey and Houston, and was focused on more up-tempo, [[Urban contemporary|Urban]]/[[Hip hop music|Hip-hop]] songs.<ref>Gardner, Elysa.

Retrieved August 19, 2005.</ref> However, by 2004, Dion had accumulated sales of more than 175 million records, and received the Chopard Diamond Award from the World Music Awards for her sales. According to the official World Music Awards website, the award is rare, it's not even "presented every year," and an artist can only be presented with the award for selling "over 100 million albums during their career."<ref>[http://www.worldmusicawards.com/ Diamond Award].

Chicago Sun-Times, March 20, 2005.</ref> She conceived the idea for the show after seeing ''[[O (Cirque du Soleil)|O]]'' by [[Franco Dragone]] early in her break from recording, and began on March 25, 2003, in a 4000-seat arena designed for her show.<ref name="autogenerated10" /> The show, put together by Dragone, was a combination of dance, music, and visual effects. It included Dion performing her biggest hits against an array of dancers and special effects. Reviewer Mike Weatherford felt that, at first, Dion was not as relaxed as she should be, and at times, it was hard to find the singer among the excessive stage ornamentations and dancers. However, he noted that the show had become more enjoyable, due to Dion's improved stage-presence and simpler costumes.<ref name="autogenerated19" />

The show was also well-received by audiences, despite the complaints of expensive tickets; the show sold out almost every night since its 2003 opening. Ticket prices were as high as $320. The show was choreographed by [[Mia Michaels]], who is a world renowned choreographer. According to ''[[Pollstar]]'', Dion sold 322,000 tickets and grossed [[United States dollar|US$]]43.9 million in the first half of 2005, and by July 2005, she had sold out 315 out of 384 shows.<ref>{{cite news | title= Dion extends long Las Vegas stint| date= September 19, 2004 | publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3670760.stm}}</ref>

==Artistry and image ==
[[Image:Star Celine.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Celine Dion star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].]]Dion grew up listening to the music of [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Carole King]], [[Anne Murray]], [[Barbra Streisand]] and the [[Bee Gees]], all of whom she would eventually collaborate with. During her younger years, which she spent performing in her parents' piano bar along with her other siblings, she also performed many songs by [[Ginette Reno]] and other popular Québécois artists. She has also expressed appreciation for [[Édith Piaf]], Sir [[Elton John]], [[Cher]] and [[opera]] singer [[Luciano Pavarotti]], as well as many soul singers of the 1960s, 70's and 80's, including [[Roberta Flack]], [[Etta James]] and [[Patti Labelle]], whose songs she would later rerecord. Her English-language material has been influenced by numerous genres, including [[pop music|pop]], [[rock music|rock]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[R&B]] and [[soul music|soul]], and her lyrics focus on themes of poverty, world hunger, and spirituality, with an overemphasis on love and romance.<ref name="autogenerated23" /><ref name="autogenerated9" /> After the birth of her child, her work also began to emphasize maternal bond and brotherly love. Dion has faced considerable criticism from many critics, who state that her music often retreats behind pop and soul conventions, and is marked by excessive sentimentality.<ref name= Enc>{{cite web | title=The Canadian Encyclopedia | work=Céline Dion Biography | url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=U1ARTU0000970

And as her hit duets...have shown, she is a reliable harmony voice."<ref name=SoundofCeline>Review/Pop; The International Sound of Celine Dion</ref>|15 px}}

Upon her debut, many critics had welcomed her restrained vocal inflections, and she was praised for her technical virtuosity and intensity. As Charles Alexander of ''[[Time Magazine|Time]]'' writes, "Her voice glides effortlessly from deep whispers to dead-on high notes, a sweet siren that combines force with grace."<ref name="autogenerated18" /> As her music progressed, however, Dion's vocal performances came to resemble more closely those of her contemporaries, especially Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey,<ref>Mulholland, Garry. ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Music'' (2003). pg. 57. UK: Flame Tree Publishing. ISBN 1-904041-70-1.</ref> and she was heavily criticized for oversinging and for lacking the emotional intensity that once was a part of her earlier work.<ref name="autogenerated7" /><ref name="autogenerated1" /> One critic noted that the emotion "seems to have been trained right out of her lovely voice", leaving her with "more voice than heart".<ref name="autogenerated16" />

}}

Many critics have stated that Dion's involvement in the production aspect of her music is fundamentally lacking, which results in her work being overproduced<ref name="autogenerated8" /> and impersonal.<ref name="autogenerated21" /> Additionally, while she came from a family in which all of her siblings were musicians, she never learned to play any instruments professionally. However, she did help to compose many of her earlier French songs, and had always tried to involve herself with the production and recording of her albums. On her first English album, which she recorded before she had a firm command of the English language, she expressed disapproval of the record, which could have been avoided if she had assumed more creative input.<ref name="autogenerated21" /> By the time she released her second English album ''[[Celine Dion (album)|Celine Dion]]'', she had assumed more control of the production and recording process, hoping to dispel earlier criticisms. She stated, "On the second album I said, 'Well, I have the choice to be afraid one more time and not be 100% happy, or not be afraid and be part of this album.' This is my album."<ref name="autogenerated21" /> She would continue to involve herself in the production of subsequent releases, helping to write a few of her songs on ''[[Let's Talk About Love]]'' (1997) and ''[[These Are Special Times]]'' (1998).<ref>Among others, Dion helped to compose "[[Treat Her Like a Lady]]" from ''Let's Talk About love'', and "[[Don't Save It All for Christmas Day]]" from ''These Are Special Times''</ref>

Despite her success, Dion is often the subject of media ridicule and parody. She is frequently impersonated on shows like ''[[MADtv]]'', ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and ''[[South Park]]'' for her strong accent, as well as her conservative nature and on-stage movements. She is also heavily mocked in her home country of Canada on popular shows ''[[Royal Canadian Air Farce]]'' and ''[[This Hour Has 22 Minutes]]''. However, Dion has stated that she is unaffected by the comments, and has even stated that she is flattered that people take the time to impersonate her.<ref name="autogenerated6" /> She even invited [[Ana Gasteyer]], who parodied her on SNL, to appear on stage during one of her performances. Dion is rarely the centre of media controversies. However, in 2005, following the [[Hurricane Katrina]] disaster, she appeared on ''[[Larry King Live]]'' and tearfully criticized Louisiana's slow response in aiding the victims of Hurricane Katrina: "We need to be there right now to rescue the rest of the people."<ref>{{cite web | title=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation| work= Céline Dion takes swipe at Iraq war; donates $1&nbsp;m to Katrina victims| url=http://www.cbc.ca/story/canada/national/2005/09/04/Arts/celine_dion_iraq20050904.html| accessmonthday=July 14 |accessyear=2006}}</ref> She later said, "When I do interviews with [[Larry King]] or the big TV shows like that, they put you on the spot, which is very difficult. I do have an opinion, but I'm a singer. I'm not a politician."<ref>{{cite book | author=Glatzer, Jenna| title=Céline Dion: For Keeps | publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing| year=2005 | id=ISBN 0-7407-5559-5}}</ref>
