'''Runcorn''' is an industrial town in the [[Halton (borough)|borough of Halton]] and the [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] of [[Cheshire]], [[England]]. It is located on the southern bank of the [[River Mersey]] where the estuary narrows to form [[Runcorn Gap]]. The name came from [[Old English language|Saxon]] ''Rumcofan'' = "wide bay or creek".  At nearby [[Norton Priory]], there are old maps showing a settlement with the name Wronkhorne.
==History==
Ruler of [[Mercia]], [[Aethelflaed]] had a fortification built at Runcorn to protect the northern frontier of her kingdom against the [[Vikings]]. Her visitation to the fort site at Castle Rock near the riverside (where the railway bridge now stands), in AD 915 is the first mention of Runcorn in recorded history.

Runcorn was not mentioned in the [[1086]] [[Domesday]] survey, though surrounding villages of [[Halton, Cheshire|Halton]], Weston, Aston, Sutton and Stockham were. Runcorn could have been integrated into Halton at that time (today Halton village is part of Runcorn, and Runcorn is part of Halton Borough) or may have been harried to worthlessness by [[William the Conqueror]].

In [[Norman dynasty|Norman]] Cheshire, the first [[Earl of Chester]], [[Hugh d'Avranches, 1st Earl of Chester|Hugh d'Avranches]] split his estate into baronies. The [[Barons of Halton|Halton barony]] held precedence over all others and Nigel, the constable of Chester (Cheshire) became its first baron. Nigel erected a [[motte and bailey]] [[castle]] on Halton Hill around [[1071]] to keep watch over the Lancashire and Cheshire plains and the river estuary. The stone structured castle, as is seen remained today, would have started development in the later half of the [[12th century]]; being gradually built upon, with each of the early barons undertaking various projects and adding to the work of his predecessor.

In [[1115]], Nigel's son, William Fitznigel, founded an [[Augustinian]] [[Priory]] at Runcorn. In [[1134]] the monks moved the priory to Norton, about three and a half miles away. The [[barons of Halton]] provided [[Norton Priory]] with substantial amounts of money until [[1200]]. In 1391 the priory was raised to the higher status of [[abbey]]. In [[1536]] the monastery was dissolved, and a few years later the buildings and some of the monastic lands were sold to [[Sir Richard Brooke]] who converted the habitable part of the Abbey into a home for himself and his family.

During the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] the castle was held for The Crown by Earl Rivers, the Steward of Halton. It fell twice to Parliamentarian [[Roundheads]]. The first siege was led by [[Sir William Brereton]] in [[1643]], the second a year later. Stone blocks removed from the castle would have been used to build many of the still existing houses in Halton village. Following the Civil War, the castle was purchased by Colonel Henry Brooke of Norton Priory. However it was only held by the Brooke family for a short period of time, as it was returned to the Duchy after the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] in [[1660]].

According to a writer in [[1656]], Runcorn was "nothing but a fair parish church, a parsonage and a few scattered tenements".  And so it remained for over a century, an isolated and poor hamlet.  The only through traffic was the [[ferry]] which crossed from Runcorn to the north bank of the River Mersey.  Towards the end of the [[18th century]] and in the early years of the [[19th century]] the town was renowned as a health resort where invalids came to take the air and to convalesce from illness.  This was all to change with the coming of the [[Industrial Revolution]].

During the 18th century water transport had been improved in the area by the Mersey and [[Irwell]] Navigation between [[Manchester]] and [[Warrington]].  By [[1773]] the [[Bridgewater Canal]] linking Runcorn with Manchester was open throughout its length.  In [[1777]] a link was made with the [[Trent and Mersey Canal]] at [[Preston Brook]].  This gave Runcorn waterway connections with most of the interior of England through the [[canal]] system and with the sea along the River Mersey, thus forming the basis for the development of the [[Port of Runcorn]].  In [[1804]] the Runcorn to [[Latchford]] canal (popularly known as the Old Quay canal) was completed which provided an improved link with the Mersey and Irwell Navigation.  Then in [[1810]] the Weston Canal was completed which provided access from the [[River Weaver]] to the Mersey avoiding the difficult entrance at the mouth of the Weaver. This navigation system led to [[Northwich]] and [[Winsford]] and so provided easier access to the [[salt]] fields of central Cheshire.

Various industries began to develop within and around the town, in particular [[quarrying]] for Runcorn [[sandstone]], [[shipbuilding]], the manufacture of [[soap]] and [[chemicals]] and [[tanning]].  The major soap manufacturers in the town were the [[John & Thomas Johnson]] and [[Hazlehurst & Sons]].  Both were making [[alkali]] using the [[Leblanc process]] by [[1830]] and in the 1830s both businesses were in the top 20 of the soap making firms in the United Kingdom.  Runcorn was becoming an industrialised and highly [[polluted]] town.

During the 19th century the town became increasingly dominated by the chemical and tanning industries.  In [[1868]] the [[Runcorn Railway Bridge]] was opened across the Mersey, giving Runcorn direct rail links with [[Liverpool]] and the rest of the country via [[Crewe]].  In [[1885]] a [[brine]] pipeline was opened between Northwich and Weston Point, supplying the salt works and nearby chemical works.  Soon after followed the construction of the [[Manchester Ship Canal]] which was opened throughout its length in [[1894]].  This allowed ocean-going ships to travel inland as far as [[Salford]], some of them calling at the port of Runcorn.  The large rise in population between 1881 and 1891 and the subsequent drop by 1901 is explained by the enormous number of people involved in constructing the ship canal at that time.  In [[1905]] the [[Widnes-Runcorn Transporter Bridge]] opened, giving a direct link for vehicular traffic for the first time between the two towns.[[Image:Silver Jubilee Bridge.jpg|thumb|Runcorn (Silver Jubilee) Bridge]]

During the first half of the [[20th century]] the industry of the town continued to be dominated by chemicals and tanning.  In [[1926]] a number of chemical companies merged to form [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (ICI).  As the century progressed there was a degree of diversification of industry.  In [[1961]] the Transporter Bridge was replaced by Runcorn Bridge (also known as the [[Silver Jubilee Bridge]]) which allowed a more efficient means of road traffic across Runcorn Gap.

Major changes were to come with the designation of Runcorn [[New Town]] in [[1964]].  The tanneries had been declining for a long time and the last one (Highfield) closed in [[1968]].  The chemical industry has also declined in the town while there has been a development of many types of light industry in the area of the Old Town and around the outskirts of the New Town.  In [[1974]] Runcorn Urban District Council merged with the [[Widnes|Borough of Widnes]] to form the [[Halton (borough)|Borough of Halton]].

==Runcorn today==
Today, Runcorn is one of the most industrial parts of the UK with the Runcorn [[Ineos]] Chlor chemical plant (previously owned by [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]]) and many other industrial buildings. 

Runcorn consists of what is referred to as 'the old town', which began expansion on farmland during the Industrial Revolution brought by the Bridgewater Canal. There is also Runcorn's so-called New Town, which was designated in 1964, in the second-wave of new towns. This housed overspill population from Liverpool. Unfortunately there was insufficient employment for the additional population which has caused social problems.

Runcorn New Town was the first to pioneer the use of bus-only roads over a large scale. 

The town also retains ruins of the 12th-century castle and the remains of the priory. Large chemical works are found at the furthest edge of the western part of the old town. This is offset by the vast greenery of the new town to the east. ''The Catalyst Museum''[http://www.catalyst.org.uk/] in neighbouring Widnes recognises the contribution of the [[chemical industry]] as it has developed around the North West.

The remains of Norton Priory, including its museum and walled garden are the main tourist attraction of the town. There is also a dry ski slope, and a shopping centre, (Halton Lea). Although (Halton Lea) has been officially renamed, most Runcorn residents choose to call it by its first name: The Shopping City or "The City" for short. Although the shopping centre was the first indoor shopping plaza in Europe, lack of investment has led to a decline in the centre, though numerous other projects mean the town is still well served.

The town has a recreation centre which is used by many local residents called Brookvale Recreation Centre and a second swimming pool (Runcorn Swimming Pool) in the Old Town. There is also a privately owned swimming pool in Runcorn's Beechwood Community Centre.
Runcorn also has an award winning arts centre [[The Brindley]], which opened in autumn 2004 to great success. [http://www.thebrindley.org.uk/].

==Shopping==

The town is unique in terms of its shopping experience since it is the only town of its size to have bi-polar shopping centres. The unique feature is due to the Town's redevelopment in the 1960's as a [[New Town]]. The original Master Plan drawn up by architect [[Arthur Ling]], called for the liquidation of Runcorn's traditional town centre and the moving of all facilities to the newly developed Halton Lea. However, subsequent local governments in [[Runcorn Urban Council]] and after 1974, [[Halton Borough Council]] have continued to ignore these proposals leading the slow, agonising but inevitable death of Runcorn Old Town as a shopping centre. Many commentators have argued that it is this bi-polar model that has harmed Runcorn's development as a major shopping centre.

However, it was not always this way. Just after the opening of the [[Shopping City]] (renamed [[Halton Lea]] in late 1990's) the town attracted a significant amount of trade damaging the growth of Warrington, Widnes and even Liverpool and Manchester's retail sectors. During that period the centre attracted huge numbers of shoppers brought by Runcorn's unique transportation system and its central location between Manchester and Liverpool. It wasn't to last though as the owners at that time Grosvenor pushed rents up in an attempt to capitalise on the centres new found fortune. Spiralling rents soon saw many of the big names that were attracting shoppers close and move centres with lower rents such as the [[Golden Square]] Shopping Centre in neighbouring [[Warrington]]. Some of the problems were blamed on the ASDA Superstore that opened across the road from the centre in 1989 however; it arguably helped to keep the centre alive bringing valuable customers to the area during the centre's poorest years.

The centre suffered for many more years after Grosvenor sold the centre to its current owners, [[Peel Holdings]]. Poor running of the centre had left it in a state of disrepair. Asbestos, building faults and out of date decor led to a huge redevelopment of the centre which eventually led to its renaming to [[Halton Lea]]. Since then the centre has grown to include a retail park named the [[Trident Retail Park]] which hosts many big name shops such as [[Currys]], [[JJB]], [[Blockbusters]], [[Gamestation]] and [[Fitness First]]. The flagship unit is a 9 screen cinema complex currently owned and operated by [[Cineworld]].

The centre is still undergoing a large scale redevelopment which will see over the next few years internal redevelopment and distribution of unit space as well as the development of new retail space both inside the centre through the opening of the centre's unused second floor (adding at least another 500,000sq ft of retail space) as well as the building of more retail parks around the centre. One retail park has plans for what would be Europe's largest supermarket although at this time no supermarket chain has yet expressed interest. It is believed [[Halton Borough Council]] want [[ASDA]] to move into the unit so its current store can be redeveloped into another retail park.

==Transport==

Runcorn is well served by roads (the [[M56 motorway]] passes to the south of the town, and fast [[Expressways]] run round and through the new town), railways; Runcorn station which is one of the major stops on the West Coast Mainline, serving as the last stop before [[Liverpool]] and the stop after [[Crewe]], and Runcorn East which is on the local line between [[Chester and [[Manchester]].  Runcorn station is located on the western side of the town near to the Old Town and Runcorn Bridge. It is the main station of the town and is operatated by Virgin Trains. It has two platforms with two waiting rooms - one on each side   and a small shop. There are elevators to assist movement across the tracks. The station is served by Virgin Trains' [[Liverpool]] to London Euston service every hour and Central Train's Liverpool to Birmingham service also every hour. It takes just under 2 hours to reach Euston and just over 15 minutes to reach Liverpool. The Central Trains service to Liverpool stops at Liverpool Southparkway, the station stop for Liverpool John Lennon Airport.

Runcorn East is a commuter station on the eastern side of the town andis on the mainline between Warrington and Chester. Often unstaffed and with no services, it is operated by Arriva Trains. Services run between [[Manchester]] to [[Chester]] and [[Manchester]] to [[Llandudno]].

Despite Runcorn being connected to [[Widnes]] across the Mersey by a rail bridge, known as Ethelfleda Railway Bridge since 1868, there is no direct train service linking Runcorn and [[Widnes]].

Road transport went by ferry until the [[1890]]s when a transporter bridge was built. This was replaced in 1961 by a steel arched bridge, officially called the Silver Jubilee Bridge, however, is known by locals in both Runcorn and Widnes (grudgingly) as the Runcorn Bridge. It is recognised as imitating a miniature version of the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]]. The town itself benefits greatly from a highly developed transportation network. To the south of the town runs the M56, to the east, the M6 and to the north across the banks of the River Mersey and neighbouring town of [[Widnes]] runs the M62.

The town also benefits from a high-speed, efficient dual carriageway system of road networks which function very much as a mini-motorway system, separated from the main road system by a series of slip roads and junctions. Each suburb/estate of the town has its own junction. The town can be easily passed through in minutes thanks to the road network. The network is so well designed that other than near the Runcorn Bridge, traffic congestion is unheard of. 

The Runcorn Bridge, which connects the town with its neighbour, [[Widnes]] suffers from heavy congestion at peak times. Congestion is unavoidable during peak travel times as it is the only crossing point between the Mersey Tunnels in Liverpool and Warrington further upstream. Both crossings are  at least 30 minutes away making the use of them unpractical. [http://www.merseycrossing.co.uk/] The [[Manchester Ship Canal]] passes alongside Runcorn and under both bridges. Buses in Runcorn use dedicated "busways", a rarity in the [[United Kingdom]].

Visitors to Runcorn are often confused by the road network as there are no direct routes between the various districts. Instead, motorists use the extensive network of [[expressways]] which allow quick access to all Runcorn areas, having been conceived to keep the bulk of traffic safely away from residential neighbourhoods. 

A downside of the 'arterial' model used for traffic flow is that vehicular travel from one district to another is always via the expressway, which can greatly add to travel distances and fuel consumption. In principle, this should have been addressed by the busway system offering a direct (and hence fast) route between districts, but (following deregulation of the bus system) the high minimum price for bus tickets has tended to make public transport uneconomic for short journeys compared to private cars. When Runcorn was planned, it was intended that appx 50% of local journeys would be by busway; this probably only applies to pensioners now. 

The town finds itself between the North West's two main International Airports, Liverpool John Lennon Airport and Manchester International. This results in Runcorn suffering from higher than average levels of noise pollution.

Runcorn, as a new town was designed with a purpose in mind. Although uniquely Runcorn served as the hotbed for many experiments, one of the main ones was focused on the creation and maintaining of a distinct network of roads separate from those available for use by the general motoring public and sanctioned exclusively for the use of public transport (excluding both public and private hire taxis) and the emergency services. Every suburb/estate is served by at least one stop on the network. Although the network is less prominent in the older sections of Runcorn that existed prior to the construction of the new town, they are still served.

On the main ring section of the network to the east of the town, encompassing the main area of new town redevelopment there is a frequent service run by Arriva North West & Wales on Routes 1  & 2. Other services that frequently use the eastern section of the network include the 110 (Arriva) to  [[Widnes]] and [[Warrington]], the X1 (Arriva) to [[Liverpool]], the X30 (Arriva) to [[Chester]] and Warrington, and the 62 (Halton Transport) to [[Widnes]] and [[Warrington]].

The two main bus operators in Halton are Halton Transport and Arriva North West & Wales. Halton Transport is one of the last few Municipal transport corporations that are owned by the local council and continue to make money. There are also a variety of smaller operators whho run usually one or two minor routes that would otherwise be uneconomical for the larger companies to run. The town is also home to two of the countries larger coach companies. Selwyns and Anthony's Travel are both national carriers but are based in Runcorn.

Halton Transport tends to serve the older areas of Runcorn to the west better than Arriva while Arriva tends to serve the easten sections more comprehensively than Halton Transport. The town is unique as it has two main bus stations. Runcorn Old Town primarily serves the outgoing traffic while Halton Lea, the main shopping centre, mainly serves internal traffic although it also plays a large role in transporting some of the population to the outgoing services.

The town also has two canal systems. The Manchester Ship Canal runs between the town and the River Mersey and is not open to non-commercial traffic. The Bridgewater Canal, a much smaller canal is open to public use and is used by many Canal Boats. There are two Canal Boat Docks in Runcorn. Waterloo Junction is the main dock and is situated at the western end of the Bridgewater Canal where the canal system was filled in during the construction of the Runcorn Bridge. The second dock is a privately owned ship yard located further west upstream and can be accessed by road via Halton Road.

==Entertainment==

Despite its larger size and population than neighbouring Widnes, Halton Borough Concil continues to encourage retail investment in Widnes, often at the expensive of Runcorn. Therefore, Runcorn shopping experience is of a poor quality and not worthy of travelling from far away unless you intend to visit Halton Lea as a tourist attraction.

Entertainment-wise though Halton Borough Council has been unable to coherce the majority of companies over to Widnes. Runcorn plays host to Halton's only multiplex cinema and for the foreseeable future probably will continue to do so.

In 2004 Halton Borough Council closed the fledging Queens Hall in Widnes and opened up a state of the art arts centre in the declining old town.  The centre named [[The Brindley]] was named after [[James Brindley]] the engineer responsible for the adjacant [[Bridgewater Canal]] and 
opened to great acclaim and has proved to be an award winning architectural design.  The centre has two performance spaces; a 420 seat main auditorium with seating on two levels, orchestra pit and vast stage, and a smaller studio theatre which doubles as a single screen cinema.  The centre has, thus far, proved a huge success and it is hoped its presence may be a vital asset to the continuing redevelopment of the town.  

Runcorn's nightlife is extremely poor although it is improving. After decades of under-investment and a reputation (that was often well deserved) that any night in Runcorn would involve yourself in at least one fight, the town is seeing a life in fortunes. However, Halton Borough Council's continued insistence of forcing entertainment and shopping facilities to locate in Widnes has resulted in Runcorn being the only town in the country that has over 60,000, a large majority of them 18-30 year olds and not have a nightclub. The town is improving gradually with higher class bars and pubs opening over the next few years, including a [[JD Wetherspoon]] pub [http://www.jdwetherspoon.co.uk/pubfinder/details.php?OutletNumber=699].

==Education and Facilties==

Runcorn has several education facilities across all education types. The town also has a large share of Catholic run schools, far higher than the national average.

The town has four high schools. The Grange Comprehensive, The Heath High School, Halton High and the Roman Catholic St Chad's Catholic High School. St Chad's and The Heath are specialist schools, Language and Technology respectively. St. Chad's is currently undergoing building work to renew its facilities.

The town also has a large higher education college, Riverside College formed from the amalgamation of Runcorn and Widnes Sixth Form College and Halton College. The college which has strong links with several universities in the region and is able to award degrees acredited by the University of Liverpool.  The college is tipped as a prime candidate for becoming a university college within the next 10 years.

==Employment==

Although the town's heritage was based on industry, the majority of Runcorn's residents now work in the service sector. There is still a stong influence from industry although it is severely diminished from several decades ago.

The town is host to several multinationals and PLCs such as Ineos Chlor whose factory uses over 1% of the total electricity prouduced in the UK per year, MFI, ASDA WAL*MART, Tesco, Woolworths and many others.

The town also has a large contingent of local and national government workers. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) was based in Runcorn when it was the Department for Education and Employment.

==Recognition==
Runcorn was part of an amusing segment on [[Danny Baker]]'s ''Fabulous World of Freak Football'' video. After a last-minute winning goal, the match commentator declared that "the crowd are going absolutely berserk". At this time, the camera showed three small children cheering wildly on the touchline in plastic macs and hats. Danny then showed footage of Chelsea fans celebrating, and noted that THAT is a crowd going absolutely berserk, while the Runcorn footage was more like a school class being told it didn't have any homework tonight.

The town's own football club, Runcorn FC, used to play at the now demolished Canal Street ground before an ill-fated move to nearby [[Widnes]] and [[Prescot]] and a rebranding as Runcorn FC Halton.  By moving the club across the Mersey the club lost many of its original fans who branded them traitors after the move.  The club folded in 2006, and is to be replaced by a new club, [[Runcorn Linnets F.C.]], playing in the [[North West Counties League]].  Although now playing at Witton Albion's ground in Northwich, some of the original Runcorn FC fans are now returning.

The [[BBC]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps]]'' is set in Runcorn.

The first two series of the [[BBC]] drama "[[Merseybeat]]" were filmed around Runcorn and Widnes.  The programme followed Police officers from the fictional "Greater Merseyside Constabulary".  In series three the station in question magically moved to central Liverpool. 

''[[Drop Dead Gorgeous (TV series)|Drop Dead Gorgeous]], a new series on [[BBC Three]], is also set in Runcorn. It tells the story of 15-year-old geeky goddess Ashley, whose life is turned upside-down when she is approached by a spotter from a local modelling agency. Events move at lightning speed and the whole family, including beautiful twin sister Jade, are affected.

The Swedish band International Harvester released a song in 1968 called "The Runcorn Report on Western Progress". According to the liner notes for their Sov-Gott Rose Marie album, one of the band members spent three months in Runcorn in 1959.

The [[Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em]] episode "The Employment Exchange" sees Frank destroy a £2m computer in Runcorn, simply by causing one in his home town to explode.
