==Plot==
[[Peter Griffin|Peter]] is a contestant on ''[[Wheel of Fortune (US game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' and wins. He chooses the prize of one week of free [[maid]] service. When his maid Joan arrives, Peter has her do humiliating things like pulling items out of his [[navel|belly button]], and riding her back to the store. Peter decides to over-work Joan on her last night by giving [[Meg Griffin|Meg]] a [[watermelon]], which explodes in her face. [[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]] meets Joan at the Griffin household. While alone outside, he announces he is in love with her. After dating Joan, Quagmire [[Marriage|proposes]] to her, which she accepts and the couple prepares their marriage ceremony. [[Lois Griffin|Lois]], Peter and their neighbors visit Quagmire's house, finding that he has changed his personality significantly. Peter still believes this to be a [[practical joke|prank]] and shows Quagmire [[pornography|porno magazines]] in an attempt to change him back to his former ways. Lois begins to question whether she should [[breastfeeding|breastfeed]] Stewie any longer, as he is hurting her when feeding because of his new teeth. Three weeks later, Lois takes Stewie to the park with [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] now she hadn't beastfeeded Stewie for weeks and her breasts are now huge. She asks Brian if she should still not breastfeed Stewie because she had now gone up two bra sizes and they are still getting bigger.

At the Quagmire's wedding reception, Lois' breasts make her shirt break. Noticing that Quagmire's staring at Lois' huge breasts, Peter spills champagne on them. Lois tries to dry them with her hands but Peter helps her by shaking her which makes her big breasts jiggle. Both of these incidents make Quagmire realize he has made a mistake by marrying Joan. He informs Joan that some of his friends think they should get a [[divorce]] after discussing it with Peter, [[Joe Swanson|Joe]] and [[Cleveland Brown|Cleveland]], but she threatens to [[Self-injury|cut herself]] and him if he divorced her. As a result, Peter decides to help Quagmire fake his death. He shows Joan a video of Quagmire being attacked by a [[ninja]], a [[Nazi]], a "pots and pans" [[robot]], and the body being consumed by a [[dinosaur]] held by Peter. Joan is unconvinced by the video. Peter and his friends operate plan B; which consists of Quagmire pretending to suffer a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and dying. Quagmire is buried in a coffin with enough oxygen to last him a short period of time so Peter can return after the funeral has finished and dig him up. However, when [[Adam West (Family Guy)|Mayor West]] announces that all coffins must be buried in concrete, Peter exclaims he is not dead, and brings Quagmire out of the coffin, alive. [[Death (Family Guy)|Death]] shows up to retrieve his body. After pleaing for Quagmire's life (and touching Death's arm, thus killing her), Death takes Joan instead, as she was [[suicide|suicidal]] and her last name was Quagmire. Lois allows Stewie to breastfeed again, thus delighting him and allowing her breasts to return to normal.<ref name="episode">{{cite video|year=2005|title=Plot synopsis information for the episode "I Take Thee Quagmire"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

==Production==
This episode is one of the first to begin with a scene which is not the Griffin family household or the town center. It starts by depicting the game show ''[[Wheel of Fortune (US game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]''.<ref name="Michel">{{cite video | people=Michel, Pete|year=2005|title=Family Guy season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "I Take Thee Quagmire"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> When Brian is watching ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]'' on television, a scene begins showing the mother of the fictional family screaming at the children and father. [[Jane Kaczmarek]] was asked to do the voice as she was the original actor in the series, however she refused. MacFarlane said that he gets a message that Kaczmarek wishes to portray that character as likable, and does not wish to jeopardize that.<ref name="MacFarlane">{{cite video | people=MacFarlane, Seth|year=2005|title=Family Guy season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "I Take Thee Quagmire"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The father during that scene was voiced by [[Bryan Cranston]], the original actor in the series, who accepted the role.<ref name="MacFarlane"/> [[Seth MacFarlane]] comments that "this is the first real Quagmire story we've ever done."<ref name="MacFarlane"/> A scene was made of Stewie attending a meeting similar to those at [[Alcoholics Anonymous]], however the meeting was designed for those who are too addicted to [[breast milk]].<ref name="Callaghan"/> The format of ''Wheel of Fortune'' is somewhat similar to the layout of the modern-day program, however the scene also features several aspects which are now no longer broadcast, and were featured in the [[1980s]].<ref name="MacFarlane"/>

==Censorship==
Two scenes during this episode were censored for television broadcasting. When Quagmire meets Joan and invites her out on a date, Cleveland asks, "Is that a banana in your pocket, or an erection in your pocket?" Although this entire scene was not censored, [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] bleeped "erection".<ref name="Goodman">{{cite video | people=Goodman, David|year=2005|title=Family Guy season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "I Take Thee Quagmire"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The scene where Peter is promoting 'Crystal Pepsi' was shown only on the DVD, because it is prohibited to promote one product over another on television.<ref name="MacFarlane"/>

==Cultural references==
When Mayor West is playing as a contestant on ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', he spells the name of the host, [[Alex Trebek]] backwards, thus sending him back to the fifth dimension. This is a reference to former animated comedy series: ''[[Super Friends]]''.<ref name="MacFarlane"/> When Peter and the children are flying through space and singing, this is a  reference to ''[[The Great Space Coaster]]''.<ref name="MacFarlane"/> The two Asian men who meet Peter at the traffic lights when riding Joan's back speak in a very similar tone to [[Howard Cosell]], a reference to [[1985 in film|1985]] cult film ''[[Better Off Dead (film)|Better Off Dead]]''.<ref name="Callaghan">{{cite video | people=Callaghan, Steve|year=2005|title=Family Guy season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "I Take Thee Quagmire"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref><ref name="MacFarlane"/> When Quagmire fantasises about being alone in the forest with Joan and speaking to her in [[Elvish]], this is a reference to a scene from ''[[Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref name="MacFarlane"/><ref name="Goodman"/> The following ballroom sequence was inspired by the Disney version of [[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]. When Peter holds the dinosaur in front of the camera, he hums the ''Theme From [[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' by [[John Williams]].

==Reception==
[[Bob Sassone]] of [[TV Squad]] commented that "this episode had one of the more hysterical/disturbing images of this TV season: Lois flashing her breasts to Brian after giving Stewie his lunch."<ref name="TVSquad">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/03/12/family-guy-i-take-thee-quagmire/|title=Family Guy: I Take Thee, Quagmire|date=[[March 12]], [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-12-04|author=Sassone, Bob|publisher=TV Squad}}</ref> Michael Drucker of [[IGN]] noted that "the Volume four episodes are easily funnier than the volume three ones", thus referring to the episode.<ref>[http://uk.dvd.ign.com/articles/744/744835p1.html Family Guy - Volume Four], Drucker, Michael.
