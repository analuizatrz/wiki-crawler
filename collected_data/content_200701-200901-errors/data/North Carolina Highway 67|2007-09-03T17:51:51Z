'''NC 67''' is a 58-mile east-west [[North Carolina]] [[state highway]]. It serves mostly the northern area of [[Yadkin County, North Carolina|Yadkin County]], connecting the towns of [[Jonesville, NC|Jonesville]], [[Boonville, NC|Boonville]] and [[East Bend, NC|East Bend]], along with the city of [[Winston-Salem, NC|Winston-Salem]] in [[Forsyth County, North Carolina|Forsyth County]].

==Route description==
The western terminus is Business [[US 21]] in [[Jonesville, NC|Jonesville]]. From this point in [[Yadkin County, North Carolina|Yadkin County]], the route travels in an easterly direction over [[Interstate 77]], through [[Boonville, North Carolina|Boonville]] and [[East Bend, North Carolina|East Bend]] before crossing the [[Yadkin River]] into [[Forsyth County, North Carolina|Forsyth County]]. 

After crossing the county line, NC 67 turns to head in a southeasterly direction through part of [[Tobaccoville, North Carolina|Tobaccoville]], and near [[Bethania, North Carolina|Bethania]] and [[Pfafftown, North Carolina|Pfafftown]] on its way into [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]]. Once within Winston-Salem's city limits, the route bears the street name Reynolda Road on its straight southeasterly journey toward downtown. Arriving at the [[Wake Forest University]] campus, NC 67 bears right onto a short 0.25-mile road known as Wake Forest Road, which connects to Silas Creek Parkway, a four-lane [[boulevard]]. NC 67 eastbound shares Silas Creek Parkway southbound around Winston-Salem's west side, past [[Hanes Mall]], to end at [[North Carolina Highway 150]] (Peters Creek Parkway) in the city's south side.

==Miscellaneous==

*The road is known for its lack of any major sharp curves throughout.  The road rolls up and down many hills in a near-perfect straight line.
*In Jonesville the route has the street name Winston Road. In Boonville it is known as Main Street. In Winston-Salem the road is known as Reynolda Road for the western segment and Silas Creek Parkway for the eastern segment. Around the year [[1998]], the route changed course and now turns in front of one of the entrances to [[Wake Forest University]] onto a short stretch of road known as Wake Forest Road. In areas outside of towns and cities, the road is simply signed "NC 67".
*The [[speed limit]] for most of the road is 55 MPH. In some areas the speed limit decreases to 45 MPH and within municipalities the speed limit is usually 35 MPH.
