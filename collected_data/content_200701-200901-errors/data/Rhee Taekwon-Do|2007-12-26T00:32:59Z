'''[[Chong Chul Rhee]]''', 8th ''[[Dan rank|dan]]'', is the founder and head of Rhee Taekwon-Do. Rhee holds the title "World Master" and claims the title "Father of Australian Taekwondo."<ref name="Founding"/><ref name="YellowPages"/><ref name="AustralasianFightingArts"/><ref name="WorldWideWeb"/> He is one of the twelve original masters of taekwondo<ref name="OriginalMasters">[http://www.itfnz.org.nz/ref/documents/masters.htm A tribute to the original masters] Retrieved on [[13 June]] [[2007]].</ref> selected from the South Korean military to develop taekwondo under [[Choi Hong Hi|Hong Hi Choi]] in the [[Korea Taekwondo Association|Korea Taekwon-Do Association]] (KTA).{{ref|3}} Rhee is a former unarmed combat instructor in the Korean Marines, and helped introduce the art of taekwondo to [[Southeast Asia]] (notably in [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]]) before becoming the first taekwondo master sent to Australia by the [[Republic of Korea]].

Rhee has worked towards the [[Korean reunification|reunification of Korea]], serving as a member during the third through ninth terms—and as Chairman for the eighth term—of the Oceania Division of the Advisory Council for Democratic and Peaceful Unification.<ref name="ODCC">[http://www.acdpuoceania.com/formal_chairman_e.html Former Chairmen of the ODCC] Retrieved on [[24 April]] [[2003]]; link has expired, as at [[15 July]] [[2007]].</ref> He has also served as Chairman of the [[1988 Summer Olympics|Seoul Olympics]] Supporting Committee and founding President of the Korean Community Hall Construction Supporting Committee.<ref name="ODCC"/> The Republic of Korea awarded Rhee the [[Dongbaeg Medal]] (''[[Hangul|동백장]]'') in 2003 for promoting taekwondo and Korean culture over the past 33 years.<ref name="SydneyKoreanHerald"/>

Two of Rhee's brothers also hold the title of Master in Rhee Taekwon-Do,{{ref|4}} and assist him in managing parts of the school:

* '''Chong Hyup Rhee''', 7th ''dan'', in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], is also one of the twelve original masters of taekwondo,<ref name="OriginalMasters"/> and appears on the right in the school's logo. He also appears to have helped introduce the art of taekwondo to Malaysia and Singapore.{{ref|5}}

* '''Chong Yoon Rhee''', 7th ''dan'', in [[New South Wales]], is a former South Korean army officer.

C. C. Rhee holds grading examinations for Rhee Taekwon-Do across most of Australia and New Zealand, while C. H. Rhee holds the grading examinations in Melbourne and Darwin.<ref name="Darwin">[http://www.angelfire.com/empire2/rhee/ Rhee Tae Kwon Do NT] Retrieved on [[24 August]] [[2007]].</ref>

== Significance ==

Rhee Taekwon-Do occupies a prominent place in Australian taekwondo history. This is reflected in three key claims:<ref name="YellowPages"/><ref name="AustralasianFightingArts"/> (1) Rhee is the Father of Australian Taekwondo, (2) Rhee Taekwon-Do is the first taekwondo school in Australia, and (3) Rhee Taekwon-Do is the biggest taekwondo school in Australia. The school has widely publicised these claims since at least the [[1980s]].

=== Father of Australian Taekwondo ===

No one has challenged Rhee's claim as the Father of Australian Taekwondo. The title might be debated, however, based on claims made about four other martial art masters:

[[Image:070616-Janggeom-Ladies.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A ladies' training session being conducted by a senior Rhee Taekwon-Do instructor]]

* '''Chan Yong Kim''', 9th ''dan'', was the first [[Tang Soo Do|tang soo do]] instructor in Australia.<ref name="Kim-Rozinsky">Ta'kody, J. (2001): "Jack Rozinsky: The art of a lifetime (Part 1)," ''Australasian Taekwondo'', 10(1):8–11.</ref> He arrived in the early 1960s,<ref name="Kim-Rozinsky"/><ref name="Kim1">[http://www.nostaekwondo.com.au/taekwondo.htm No's Taekwondo] Retrieved on [[15 June]] [[2007]].</ref><ref name="Kim2">Stone, B. (2003): "Man of honour: Master Ke Hyung No," ''Australasian Taekwondo'', 12(3):14–17.</ref> sponsored by the Silvertop Taxi Karate Club<ref name="Kim-Rozinsky"/><ref name="Rozinsky1">Anon. (2007): "Jack Rozinsky," in S. Morelli (Ed.), ''Taekwondo: Special collector's edition 2007'' (pp. 54–55). Mulgrave, Australia: Blitz Publications.</ref> or the Australian Judo Federation,<ref name="Kim3">[http://www.thackreytkd.com/chanyongkim.shtml Biography of Grandmaster Chan-Yong Kim] Retrieved on [[15 June]] [[2007]].</ref> and stayed for one or two years before moving overseas. Kim might be considered the first taekwondo instructor in Australia,{{ref|5}} and so might lay claim to the title. He did not establish a taekwondo school in Australia.

* '''Jack Rozinsky''', 9th ''dan'' ([[Jidokwan]]), founded the Shuto Karate Club in 1963;<ref name="Rozinsky1"/><ref name="Rozinsky2">Rozinsky, J. (1996): "Fighting frames," ''Australasian Taekwondo'', 4(4):53.</ref> it later became the Melbourne Taekwondo Centre. As Rozinsky taught tang soo do there, he might be considered the first taekwondo school founder in Australia,{{ref|5}} and so might lay claim to the title. He did not introduce taekwondo outside Victoria.

* '''Terence Walsh''', 8th ''dan'' (World Kido Federation), claims to have introduced taekwondo to New South Wales in 1969.<ref name="Walsh1">Walsh, T. F. (1999): "Grandmaster Kwang Sung Hang: Taekwondo pioneer," ''Australasian Taekwondo'', 8(3):48–50.</ref><ref name="Walsh2">[http://www.walshtkd.com/ Walsh Martial Arts Australia] Retrieved on [[14 June]] [[2007]].</ref> If he was the first to introduce taekwondo to Australia's most populous state, then he might lay claim to the title. He did not introduce taekwondo outside the eastern states.

* '''Young Ku Yun''', 8th ''dan'' (ITF), has been described as having introduced taekwondo to [[Sydney]] in 1971.<ref name="Yun1">Anon. (1997): "Grandmaster Yun: The changing face of martial arts," ''Australasian Taekwondo'', 6(2):9–12.</ref> If he was the first to introduce taekwondo to Australia's largest city, then he might lay claim to the title. He arrived around five years after Rhee, however, and himself claimed to be the first ITF instructor (rather than the first taekwondo instructor) in Australia.<ref name="Yun2">[http://www.yunjungdo.com.au/ Yun Jung Do] Retrieved on [[21 June]] [[2007]].</ref>

Kim would have been in the lower ''dan'' ranks, and would not yet have held the title of Master, when he was invited to teach in Australia. Rozinsky and Walsh would have held 1st ''dan'' ranking in the 1960s. Both Rhee (KTA) and Yun (ITF) would have been in the middle ''dan'' ranks and held the title of Master when they arrived, as they were sent to Australia by their respective Korean governing bodies.

=== First taekwondo school in Australia ===

Rhee Taekwon-Do's position as the first taekwondo school in Australia might be challenged by the Melbourne Taekwondo Centre (originally the Shuto Karate Club),<ref name="Rozinsky1"/> as tang soo do was one of the arts taught there.{{ref|6}} Rhee's school is the first nationwide taekwondo school in Australia, having operated in South Australia from at least 1967, Western Australia from at least 1970,<ref name="Fricke1">Fricke, H.

=== Biggest taekwondo school in Australia ===

Rhee Taekwon-Do's position as the biggest taekwondo school in Australia is supported by independently-verifiable listings of ''dojang''.<ref name="YellowPages"/><ref name="NationalListing"/> The claim might be disputed if the Australian members of the ITF and the WTF were considered as 'schools' as a whole, but Rhee Taekwon-Do is a single school under the direct leadership of Rhee while both the ITF<ref name="ITFConstitution1">[http://www.itftkd.org/fileadmin/archive/commons/20070508_ITF_Constitution.pdf International Taekwon-Do Federation Constitution (28 April 2007)] (ITF-NK, Chang) Retrieved on [[26 August]] [[2007]].</ref><ref name="ITFConstitution2">[http://www.itf-administration.com/constitution.asp International Taekwon-Do Federation Constitution] (ITF-C, Choi) Retrieved on [[26 August]] [[2007]].</ref> and WTF<ref name="WTFOrganisation">[http://www.wtf.org/site/about_wtf/organization.htm World Taekwondo Federation organizational chart] Retrieved on [[26 August]] [[2007]].</ref> are groups of schools (each with its own head) under a larger governing body.

== Ex-Rhee members ==

At least 20 founders of Australian martial art schools (and at least one in New Zealand) received their foundational taekwondo training in Rhee Taekwon-Do or are former Rhee Taekwon-Do instructors. Of these ex-members, the highest-ranked was a Rhee Taekwon-Do 4th ''dan'' instructor when he left Rhee's school.

[[Image:070617-Janggeom-Promotion.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Rhee promoting a member to the rank of Rhee Taekwon-Do 1st ''dan'']]

=== International Taekwon-Do Federation ===

Ex-members who founded ITF schools include three of the most senior ITF instructors in Australia. Ming Tuck Low, 8th ''dan'', attained the rank of Rhee Taekwon-Do 1st ''dan'' in 1971, and was a Rhee Taekwon-Do instructor at the [[University of Western Australia]] in 1972.<ref name="Low1">McQueen, P.

=== Other taekwondo styles ===

Ex-members who founded non-ITF taekwondo schools include three of the more expansionist instructors in Australia. John Ivanov, 7th ''dan'', was a Rhee Taekwon-Do regional instructor in Queensland in 1995.<ref name="Ivanov-Dicks">Anon.

=== Other martial arts ===

Ex-members who founded schools teaching martial arts other than taekwondo include three instructors with an eclectic martial arts history. Hans Fricke, 8th ''dan'', first met Rhee in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] in 1970, was a Rhee Taekwon-Do 2nd ''dan'' instructor in Sydney during the 1970s, and now teaches [[Battōjutsu|battodo]].<ref name="Fricke1"/><ref name="Fricke2">[http://www.japaneseswordsmanship.com.au/ABA_ranks_32.html Australian Battodo Association Dan registry] Retrieved on [[25 August]] [[2007]].</ref> Christopher Nasilowski, 10th ''dan'', trained in Rhee Taekwon-Do in Adelaide from 1972–1984, was a Rhee Taekwon-Do 2nd ''dan'' instructor, and now teaches [[Filipino martial arts|arnis]] and [[Jujutsu|jujitsu]].<ref name="Nasilowski">[http://www.usadojo.com/biographies/christopher-nasilowski.htm Martial arts biography: Christopher Nasilowski] Retrieved on [[30 July]] [[2007]].</ref> Graham Healy, 7th ''dan'', commenced Rhee Taekwon-Do training in Queensland in the 1980s, was a Rhee Taekwon-Do instructor, and now teaches [[boxing]] and taekwondo.<ref name="Healy">[http://healyshealthandfitness.com/ Healy's Health and Fitness] Retrieved on [[14 June]] [[2007]].</ref> At least three other ex-members have founded other martial art schools.{{ref|9}}

== Training ==

[[Image:070617-Janggeom-Drill.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A Rhee Taekwon-Do self-defence drill to practise deflecting an incoming punch aimed at the face]]

Rhee Taekwon-Do [[training]] consists of exercises that may be classified as: basics (group drill exercises; similar to ''[[kihon]]'' in [[karate]]), [[Breaking (martial arts)|destruction]] (breaking), [[hyung]] (patterns or forms), [[self-defence]], and [[sparring]]. Basics, destruction, hyung, and self-defence are similar to equivalent exercises in other traditional martial art schools. Rhee Taekwon-Do [[sparring]] is different to that in ITF and WTF schools, having more in common with [[Kumite#Delivering_strikes|traditional karate sparring]].

Rhee Taekwon-Do sparring is unscored, unarmoured,<ref name="Sparring1">Anon. (1993): "Master Rhee: Interview by a special reporter," ''Rhee Taekwondo'', Autumn 1993:4–5.</ref> and usually 'non-contact' in principle. Members typically achieve non-contact sparring by two methods, whether separately or in combination:

* '''The attacker''' consciously stops just short of hitting the training partner, while still executing attacks with full speed and power.<ref name="Sparring1"/><ref name="Sparring2">Lofthouse, D. (1993): "No contact," ''Rhee Taekwondo'', Summer 1993:7.</ref> The attacker has primary responsibility for non-contact, at a given moment during sparring, and this typically occurs when one training partner has more experience than the other.

* '''The defender''' actively avoids or blocks an incoming attack executed by the training partner.<ref name="Sparring3">Coleman, A. (1993): "Effective self-defence is learnt through non-contact sparring," ''Rhee Taekwondo'', Summer 1993:31.</ref> The defender has primary responsibility for non-contact, at a given moment during sparring, and this typically occurs with training partners of similar experience.

== Ranks ==

[[Image:070616-Janggeom-Tiles.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A twin knife-hand strike into two stacks of roof tiles as part of a Rhee Taekwon-Do 2nd ''dan'' grading test]]

Rhee Taekwon-Do [[Rank|ranks]] are denoted by coloured belts, which indicate a member's level of experience and responsibility within the school. There are ten coloured belt grades, or [[Kup rank|''kup'' rank]]s ([[Hangul|급]]), and nine [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] degrees, or [[Dan rank|''dan'' rank]]s ([[Hangul|단]]).<ref name="Rank">See any ''Rhee Taekwon-Do'' membership booklet.</ref>

Members start with white belts and progress through yellow, green, blue, brown, and then black. 'Tips' denoting odd-numbered ''kup'' ranks are marked by a stripe of the higher colour near the right end (from the wearer's point of view) of a belt of the lower colour. ''Dan'' ranks are represented by a white bars embroidered on a black belt. A black belt with no bars is a Junior Black Belt, a rank assigned to members considered too young for 1st ''dan''.

To attain Rhee Taekwon-Do 1st ''dan'' ranking typically takes around five years of regular training. Progression through the school's ''dan'' ranks is by invitation,<ref name="Craig">Anon. (2006): "Juliette presented with high honour from World Master," ''Maryborough Herald'' (10 May 2006), p. 21.</ref> and is usually slower than in other taekwondo schools. Promotion to 2nd ''dan'' might come after 10–15 years, in which time someone might have reached 4th ''dan'' (ITF)<ref name="Choi">Choi, H. H. (1993): ''Taekwon-Do: The Korean art of self-defence, 3rd ed.'' (Vol. 1, p. 94). Mississauga: International Taekwon-Do Federation.</ref> or 5th ''dan'' (WTF).<ref name="Kukkiwon">[http://www.kukkiwon.or.kr/english/examination/examination08.jsp?div=01 Kukkiwon promotion test regulations (Article 8)] Retrieved on [[19 July]] [[2007]].</ref> Promotion to 3rd ''dan'' might come after 20–25 years, in which time someone might have reached 6th ''dan'' (ITF)<ref name="Choi"/> or 7th ''dan'' (WTF).<ref name="Kukkiwon"/> Several former Rhee Taekwon-Do instructors who joined other taekwondo organisations received new ranks consistent with these approximations.{{ref|10}}
