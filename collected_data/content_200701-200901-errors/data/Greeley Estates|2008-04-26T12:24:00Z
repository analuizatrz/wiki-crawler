'''Greeley Estates''' is a [[post-hardcore]] band from [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Arizona]].

==Biography==

Greeley Estates was one of [[PureVolume]]’s top 10 unsigned artists with over a million plays&mdash;an accolade supported by having album sales in the top 10 on Smartpunk since October 2004. Their distribution record further secured them a position on the Smartpunk chart for “Sales of All Time.” They were on every date of the [[Vans Warped Tour]] in 2005. Greeley Estates' work is featured on the Punk the Clock Vol. 1 & 2 compilations, along with artists such as [[Taking Back Sunday]], [[Acceptance (band)|Acceptance]], [[Mae]], and [[Underoath]]. They have also appeared on the 2005 Warped tour compilation.  The band also performed on the Hurley Stage for the entirety of the 2006 Vans Warped Tour and the entire 2006 Taste of Chaos.

In 2005, they signed to Record Collection and co-headlined the MySpace Fall Tour 2005.

Other accomplishments include: completing three US tours since November 2004, a DVD entitled "The Death of Greeley Estates" released in May 2005, playing on the [[Taste Of Chaos]] tour, and continual play on [[KEDJ]] 103.9 [[alternative rock]] radio in Phoenix. 

The original drummer for the band was Mike Coburn.  He left the band shortly before they started touring at the end of 2003. Brian Champ soon became the drummer for Greeley Estates.

The original bassist, Jared, left Greeley Estates before they began touring the US. Jared was then replaced by Josh Applebach.

On January 31, 2007, bassist Josh Applebach announced that he would leave Greeley Estates for a teaching career in Arizona. Bradley Murray (previously with [[Versus the Mirror]]) from [[Tucson]], [[Arizona]] became their touring bassist. His first live appearance with the band was on February 3, 2007 in [[Safford, Arizona|Safford]], [[Arizona]].

On June 3, 2007, guitarist Dallas Smith announced he would be leaving the band in order to start up a family with his wife and expected twin daughters (he and his wife were to subsequently lose the pregnancy).  He made this announcement via a Myspace bulletin and announced that his last show would be June 20, 2007 at the Clubhouse in Tempe, Arizona.  

After their Mexican tour with Silverstein, Brad Murray left the band for personal reasons.

On September 4, 2007, Greeley Estates recorded their new album. The two new members of Greeley Estates include Alex Torres (previously with Eyes Set To Kill) and Joshua Ferguson (previously with Glory Nights)

After the band finished recording their new album "GO WEST YOUNG MAN, LET THE EVIL GO EAST", Joshua Ferguson left to complete his apprenticeship as a hair stylist at BLACK MARKET HAIR in Calgary Alberta Canada, personal reasons seem to be why he left.  

Greeley Estates has announced Tyler "Telle" Smith (former lead singer/frontman of In Fear And Faith (Rise Records), former guitarist/vocals of Emarosa (Rise Records), and former guitarist/keyboardist/vocals of March And Collapse) as their new bassist.  He is the singer for their entire EP "Voyage".  He also maintains a solo project on myspace called Beyond Breath (myspace.com/beyondxbreath).  Telle played his first show with the band on [[February 9]], [[2008]] at the Clubhouse in Tempe, Arizona.

Their New Album titled "Go West Young Man, Let The Evil Go East" will be released on [[May 6]], [[2008]]
