The [[NZR RM class]] '''Vulcan railcars''' were operated by the [[New Zealand Railways Department]] in the [[South Island]] of [[New Zealand]].  All New Zealand [[railcar]]s were classified as '''RM''', and these were known as ''Vulcan'' railcars, from the name of the manufacturer, [[Vulcan Foundry]] of Britain.    

== Background ==

On [[9 May]] [[1938]], the [[Minister of Railways (New Zealand)|Minister of Railways]] announced an order for ten Vulcan railcars.  They were to provide a service on the [[Midland Line, New Zealand|Midland Line]] from [[Christchurch]] to the [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast]], replacing the [[NZR RM class (Leyland diesel)|Leyland diesel railcars]] built in 1936 for the service as a temporary measure.  

The Vulcan railcars had a driver's compartment at each end, so they did not need to be turned at the terminus for the return journey. They originally had 28 and 22 seats in the two passenger compartments, but the second compartment was reduced to 20 seats with a small guard's compartment replacing two seats and reducing the number of passengers from 50 to 48.

They had a low axle loading to operate on routes like the [[Stillwater - Westport Line]] with light bridges, hence the power bogie was built with three axles with an intermediate carrying axle instead of two axles as originally proposed.  They were designed to operate at speeds of up to 120 km/h (75 mph), though in service they were restricted to a maximum speed of 90 km/h (55 mph), still fast for rural New Zealand railway lines at the time.

The first Vulcan railcar arrived in New Zealand in September 1940. Three more arrived by April 1941, with all nine members in operation by the second half of 1942. Ten railcars had been ordered, but only nine arrived in New Zealand as the ship carrying the tenth was sunk during [[World War II]].

== Speed record ==
On trial on [[25 October]] [[1940]], the railcar achieved a speed of 125.5 km/h (78 mph) on a section of the Midland Line east of [[Springfield, New Zealand|Springfield]].  This remains the fastest speed officially attained on New Zealand's railway network, though unofficially, it has been claimed that [[NZR Ja class|J<sup>A</sup> class]] [[steam locomotive]]s attained higher speeds on the "racetrack" section of the [[Main South Line]] near [[Rakaia]].  

== Operation ==

Before all members of the class had arrived, the Vulcans and Leyland diesel railcars alternated services along the Midland Line and the [[Ross Branch]] to [[Hokitika]], but by September 1942, the Vulcans had fully taken over the service and the Leylands were withdrawn and scrapped.  From [[7 September]] [[1942]], wartime petrol restrictions meant the Vulcans were put into service on the Stillwater - Westport Line, even though the line through the [[Buller Gorge]] technically wasn't finished and hadn't been handed over to the Railways Department from the [[New Zealand Ministry of Works|Public Works Department]].  Also due to the petrol restrictions, a service between Christchurch and [[Timaru]] was instituted and the Hokitika run extended all the way to [[Ross, New Zealand|Ross]].  After the war ended, the Timaru run was cancelled, but the West Coast services continued to operate.

In 1955, the [[NZR RM class (88 seater)|88 seater]] railcars entered service in New Zealand, and on [[20 February]] [[1956]], they began operating the services from Christchurch to Ross via Greymouth, significantly reducing the use of the Vulcans.  Accordingly, some Vulcans were transferred to [[Dunedin]] and put to use on passenger services along the [[Otago Central Railway]] to [[Cromwell, New Zealand|Cromwell]], commencing service on [[1 October]] [[1956]].  In April 1957, three derailments led to the postponement of the service while the line was upgraded, and the service did not resume until [[10 November]] [[1957]].  From [[11 May]] [[1958]], the portion of the trip from [[Alexandra, New Zealand|Alexandra]] to Cromwell was cancelled due to low passenger numbers.  Also that year, another use was found for the Vulcans, with a weekday morning service operated from [[Palmerston, New Zealand|Palmerston]] to Dunedin and a return service run in the evening.  This commenced on [[29 September]] [[1958]], and the railcars were also used for suburban Dunedin services, notably a midday service along the [[Port Chalmers Branch]], whenever they were available for such use.

The Vulcan railcars were never used in the [[North Island]], where the [[NZR RM class (Standard)|Standard railcars]] performed a similar job.

== Withdrawal and preservation ==

The age of the railcars and declining passenger numbers due to competition from road transport led to the decline in use of the Vulcans. The service between Westport and Greymouth ceased in 1967, and after almost three decades of heavy use in the rural South Island, they were all withdrawn from service by 1978.

Four of the nine were preserved, one by the [[Plains Vintage Railway]] (RM 50) and three by the [[Ferrymead Railway]] (RM 51, RM 56, RM 57).  RM 56 in particular sees regular use.
