The '''Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Light Infantry''' was an [[infantry]] [[regiment]] of the [[British Army]].

It was formed in [[1994]] by the amalgamation of two English regiments.

*[[The Gloucestershire Regiment]]
*[[The Duke of Edinburgh's Royal Regiment|The Duke of Edinburgh's Royal Regiment (Berkshire and Wiltshire)]]

The regiment was unique in the [[British Army]] in that it was permitted to wear the United States [[Presidential Unit Citation (US)|Distinguished Unit Citation]], which it inherited from the 1st Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment which was awarded for their  defence of [[Gloster Hill]] during the [[Battle of the Imjin River]] in April [[1951]] during the [[Korean War]].

It was also unique in being the only regiment in the British Army permitted to wear a [[cap badge]] on both the front and the rear of their headdress. The back badge was awarded to the [[28th Regiment of Foot]] for their actions at the [[Battle of Alexandria]] in [[1801]] when the regiment fought on whilst completely surrounded by the enemy.  During the [[Battle of the Imjin River]], during the Korean War, the 1st Battalion, [[Gloucestershire Regiment]] (the Glorious Glosters), and their mortar battery — numbering perhaps 750 men in total — again fought on when surrounded on [[Gloster Hill]] by at least one Chinese division of 10,000 men.

Between [[2002]] and [[2005]], the 1st Battalion, Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment served as a [[public duties]] battalion in London, where its duties included providing the [[Queen's Guard]]. It was while the RGBW was on guard at [[Buckingham Palace]] that the [[Fathers 4 Justice Buckingham Palace protest#Buckingham Palace protest|Fathers 4 Justice protest]] took place.

On [[16 December]] [[2004]], it was announced that the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment was to be disbanded - the Gloucestershire element, along with the [[Devonshire and Dorset Regiment]] was to be merged with the [[The Light Infantry|Light Infantry]], while the Berkshire and Wiltshire elements would have merged with the [[Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment]]. In March [[2005]], it was further announced that the de-amalgamation of the regiment would not take place; instead it would merge completely with the Devonshire and Dorset Regiment as 1st Battalion, Light Infantry. In preparation for this, the regiment was moved from the [[Prince of Wales' Division]] to the [[Light Division]] and renamed the '''Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Light Infantry''' in July [[2005]].

On [[24 November]] [[2005]], the MOD announced further changes to the amalgamations. The regiment would still merge with the [[Devonshire and Dorset Regiment]] resulting in a single battalion, however, they were now to join a new large regiment created by the alamgamation of [[The Light Infantry]] and the [[Royal Green Jackets]]. This new regiment was to be called [[The Rifles]] and would be formed by the end of 2007. The battalion that will result from the merger of the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment and the [[Devonshire and Dorset Regiment]] will be designated '''1st Battalion, [[The Rifles]]'''. On becoming part of a rifle regiment, the RGBW will no longer carry its [[colours, standards and guidons|colours]]; the Colours of the 1st. Battalion will be laid up at [http://www.glosters.org.uk The Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum], Gloucester and the Colours of the 2nd Battalion will be laid up at the Wardrobe, Regimental Museum, Salisbury.
