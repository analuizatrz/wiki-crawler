'''Aluminium chloride''' (AlCl<sub>3</sub>) is a [[chemical compound|compound]] of [[aluminium]] and [[chlorine]].   The solid has a low melting and boiling point, and is [[Covalent bond|covalently bonded]]. It [[sublimation (physics)|sublimes]] at 178 °[[celsius|C]].  Molten AlCl<sub>3</sub> [[conductance|conducts]] [[electricity]] poorly,<ref name="Greenwood">N. N. Greenwood, A. Earnshaw, ''Chemistry of the Elements'', Pergamon Press, [[Oxford]], [[United Kingdom]], 1984.</ref> unlike more [[ionic bond|ionic]] [[halide]]s such as [[sodium chloride]].  It exists in the solid state as a six-coordinate layer lattice.

AlCl<sub>3</sub> adopts the "YCl<sub>3</sub>" structure, featuring  Al<sup>3+</sup> cubic close packed layered structure.<ref name="Wells">A. F. Wells,  ''Structural Inorganic Chemistry'', Oxford Press, [[Oxford]], [[United Kingdom]], 1984.</ref>  In contrast, AlBr<sub>3</sub> has a more molecular structure, with the Al<sup>3+</sup> centers occupying adjacent tetrahedral holes of the close-packed framework of Br<sup>−</sup> ions.  Upon melting AlCl<sub>3</sub> gives the [[dimer]] Al<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>, which can [[vapour|vaporise]].  At higher [[temperature]]s this Al<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub> dimer [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociates]] into trigonal planar AlCl<sub>3</sub>, which is structurally analogous to [[boron trifluoride|BF<sub>3</sub>]].

[[Image:Aluminium-trichloride-3D-structures.png|left|400px|The three structures of aluminium trichloride]]

Aluminium chloride is highly [[deliquescent]], and it can explode in contact with [[water (molecule)|water]] because of the high heat of [[hydration]].  It partially [[hydrolysis|hydrolyses]] with [[water (molecule)|H<sub>2</sub>O]], forming some [[hydrogen chloride]] and/or [[hydrochloric acid]].  [[Aqueous]] [[solution]]s of AlCl<sub>3</sub> are fully ionized, and thus [[conductance|conduct]] [[electricity]] well.  Such solutions are found to be [[acid|acidic]], indicating that partial [[hydrolysis]] of the Al<sup>3+</sup> ion is occurring.  This can be described (simplified) as:

:[Al(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O {{unicode|⇌}} [Al(OH)(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>5</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> + H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>

AlCl<sub>3</sub> is probably the most commonly used non-[[Brønsted-Lowry acid]] and also one of the most powerful.  It finds widespread application in the [[chemical industry]] as a [[catalyst]] for [[Friedel-Crafts]] reactions, both acylations and alkylations.  It also finds use in [[polymerization]] and [[isomerization]] reactions of [[hydrocarbon]]s. Aluminum chloride, like similar compounds such as [[Aluminium chlorohydrate]], is also commonly used as an [[antiperspirant]].

[[Aluminium]] also forms a lower [[chloride]], aluminum(I) chloride (AlCl), but this is very unstable and only known in the vapour phase.<ref name="Greenwood"/>

== Chemical Properties ==
'''Aluminium chloride''' is a powerful [[Lewis acid]], capable of forming stable Lewis acid-base adducts with even weak [[Lewis base]]s such as [[benzophenone]] or [[mesitylene]].<ref name="Friedel">G. A. Olah (ed.), ''Friedel-Crafts and Related Reactions'', Vol. 1, [[John Wiley & Sons|Interscience]], [[New York]], 1963.</ref>  Not surprisingly it forms AlCl<sub>4</sub><sup>−</sup> in the presence of [[chloride]] ion.

In water, partial hydrolysis forms [[hydrogen chloride|HCl gas]] or H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>, as described in the overview above.  [[Aqueous solution]]s behave similarly to other [[aluminium]] [[salt]]s containing hydrated Al<sup>3+</sup> [[ion]]s - for example giving a gelatinous [[precipitate]] of [[aluminium hydroxide]] upon reaction with the correct quantity of aqueous [[sodium hydroxide]]:

AlCl<sub>3</sub>([[aqueous|aq]])  +  3[[sodium hydroxide|NaOH]]([[aqueous|aq]])  →  [[aluminium hydroxide|Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>]]([[solid|s]])  +  3[[sodium chloride|NaCl]]([[aqueous|aq]])

== Preparation ==
'''Aluminium chloride''' is manufactured by the [[exothermic]] reaction of the elements,<ref name="Greenwood"/>  [[aluminium]] and [[chlorine]].  It is commercially available in large quantities.

== Uses ==
The [[Friedel-Crafts]] reaction<ref name="Friedel"/> is the major use for aluminium chloride, for example in the preparation of [[anthraquinone]] (for the [[dye|dyestuffs]] industry) from [[benzene]] and [[phosgene]].<ref name="Greenwood"/>  In the general [[Friedel-Crafts]] reaction<ref name="Friedel"/> an [[acyl chloride]] or [[alkyl halide]] reacts with an [[aromatic]] system as shown:

[[Image:AlCl3_FriedelCrafts.gif|300px]]

With [[benzene]] [[derivative]]s, the major product is the [[para]] [[isomer]].  The alkylation reaction has many associated problems, such as in [[Friedel-Crafts]], so it is less widely used than the acylation reaction.  For both reactions the aluminum chloride (and other materials and the equipment) must be moderately dry, although a trace of moisture is necessary for the reaction to proceed.  A general problem with the Friedel-Crafts reaction is that the aluminium chloride "[[catalyst]]" needs to be present in full [[stoichiometry|stoichiometric]] quantities in order for the reaction to go to completion, because it [[Complex (chemistry)|complex]]es strongly with the products (see chemical properties above).  This makes it very difficult to recycle, so it must be destroyed after use, generating a large amount of corrosive waste.  For this reason chemists are examining the use of more [[green chemistry|environmentally benign]] catalysts such as [[ytterbium]](III) [[triflate]] or [[dysprosium]](III) triflate, which can be
[[recycling|recycled]].

Aluminium chloride can also be used to introduce [[aldehyde]] groups onto [[aromatic]] rings, for example via the [[Gatterman-Koch reaction]] which uses [[carbon monoxide]], [[hydrogen chloride]] and a [[copper(I) chloride]] co-[[catalyst]]):<ref>L. G. Wade, ''Organic Chemistry'', 5th edition, [[Prentice Hall]], [[Saddle River (New Jersey)|Upper Saddle River]], [[New Jersey]], United States, 2003.</ref>

[[Image:AlCl3_formylation.gif|300px]]

Aluminium chloride finds a wide variety of other applications in [[organic chemistry]].<ref>
P. Galatsis, in: ''Handbook of Reagents for Organic Synthesis: Acidic and Basic Reagents'', (H. J. Reich, J. H. Rigby, eds.), pp12-15, [[John Wiley & Sons|Wiley]], [[New York]], 1999.</ref> For example, it can catalyse the "[[ene reaction]]", such as the addition of [[3-buten-2-one]] (methyl vinyl ketone) to [[carvone]]:<ref> B. B. Snider, ''Accounts of Chemical Research'' '''13''', 426 (1980).</ref>

[[Image:AlCl3_ene_rxn.gif|400px]]

AlCl<sub>3</sub> is also widely used for [[polymerization]] and [[isomerization]] reactions of [[hydrocarbon]]s.  Important examples<ref name="Greenwood"/> include the manufacture of [[ethylbenzene]], which used to make [[styrene]] and thus [[polystyrene]], and also production of [[dodecylbenzene]], which is used for making [[detergent]]s.

Aluminium chloride combined with aluminum in the presence of an arene can be used to synthesize bis(arene) metal complexes, e.g. [[bis(benzene)chromium]], from certain metal halides via the so-called [[Ernst Otto Fischer|Fischer]]-Hafner synthesis.

Aluminium chloride (hexahydrate) solution is used in [[Deodorant|antiperspirants]] at low concentrations.  [[Hyperhidrosis]] sufferers need a much higher concentration (15% or higher), sold under such brand names as Drysol®, Maxim®, Odaban®, CertainDri®, and Driclor®.

== Precautions ==
Avoid bringing anhydrous AlCl<sub>3</sub> in contact with [[water (molecule)|water]] or [[base (chemistry)|base]]s, or an explosive reaction may result, yielding misty HCl fumes and heat.  Gloves and [[safety goggles]] should be worn, along with a face shield for larger amounts.  The material should be handled in a [[fume cupboard]] or [[chemical hood]].  When handled in moist air, AlCl<sub>3</sub> rapidly absorbs moisture to become a highly [[acid]]ic and sticky "goo", and it rapidly attacks many materials such as [[stainless steel]] and [[rubber]].
