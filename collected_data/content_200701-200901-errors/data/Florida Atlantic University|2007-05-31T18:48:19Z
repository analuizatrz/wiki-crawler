'''Florida Atlantic University''', also commonly referred to as '''FAU''' or '''Florida Atlantic''', is a [[public university|public]] [[coeducation]]al [[research]] [[university]] located in [[Boca Raton]], [[Florida]], [[United States|USA]]. The university has six additional satellite campuses in [[Florida]] located in the cities of [[Dania Beach, Florida|Dania Beach]], [[Davie, Florida|Davie]], [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]], [[Jupiter, Florida|Jupiter]], [[Port St. Lucie, Florida|Port St. Lucie]], and [[Fort Pierce, Florida|Fort Pierce]] at the [[Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution]]. FAU's seven campuses span 150 [[mile]]s of Florida's eastern coastline and serve a seven-[[county]] region which has a populace of more than five million people.<ref name="Release">{{cite press release | title =Early Detection of Developmental Disorders in Babies to be a Focus of New Infant Development Laboratory | publisher = Florida Atlantic University   | date = 2005-09-22 | url =http://wise.fau.edu/communications/pressarchive/2005-09/16.php | accessdate = 2006-08-22}}</ref>

The university opened its doors in [[1964]], becoming the fifth public university in Florida, and the first university in the nation to offer only upper-division and graduate level courses. Florida Atlantic was established by the [[Florida Legislature]] in order to serve the educational needs of the southeastern section of the state. While initial enrollment was 867 students, this number would increase dramatically in 1984 when the university admitted its first undergraduate students.<ref name="History 1955-1969">{{cite web | url = http://www.fau.edu/explore/timeline.php | title = Explore FAU History: Milestones in FAU History (1955-1969) | publisher = Florida Atlantic University | accessdate = 2006-08-22}}</ref> By [[2007]], enrollment has grown to more than 26,000 students representing 144 countries, 48 [[US state|states]] and the [[District of Columbia]].<ref name="Facts">{{cite web | url = http://www.fau.edu/academic/iea/inst/facts.htm | title = 2006-2007 Quick Facts | publisher = Florida Atlantic University: Office of Institutional Effectiveness & Analysis | accessdate = 2006-12-26}}</ref> Since its inception, FAU has awarded 100,000 degrees to more than 95,000 alumni worldwide.

Although FAU provides for the educational needs of commuter students, in recent years it has successfully undertaken an effort to increase its academic and research standings while evolving into a more traditional university. Under the direction of current [[President]] [[Frank Brogan|Frank T.

==History==
{{main article|History of Florida Atlantic University}}
On [[July 15]], [[1961]], the [[Florida Legislature]] passed an act authorizing the establishment of a new university in southeastern Florida.  A [[1940s]]-era [[Boca Raton Airport|Army airbase]] in Boca Raton, Florida, was selected as the site of the new university.  In [[1962]], the [[Florida Board of Control]] selected "Florida Atlantic University" as the name of the new institution.  Ground was broken on [[December 8]], [[1962]].  FAU opened on [[September 14]], [[1964]], six days behind schedule because of [[Hurricane Cleo]].  The first university in the nation to offer only upper-division and graduate work, FAU had an initial student body of 867.  U.S. [[Presidential system|President]] [[Lyndon Johnson]] dedicated the university on October 25, 1964, and received the first honorary doctorate awarded by Florida Atlantic.  
[[Image:FAU Alumni Plaza.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Alumni Plaza]]

In [[1969]], the [[Florida Board of Regents|Board of Regents]] (successor to the Board of Control) approved an intercollegiate athletics program at FAU.  The university teams become known as the [[Burrowing owl|Owls]].  FAU expanded to [[Broward County, Florida]] in 1971, with the founding of the Commercial Boulevard campus in [[Fort Lauderdale]].  During that same year the university was also named a burrowing owl sanctuary.  By 1973, fall semester enrollment was 5,632.  By the fall semester of [[1983]], enrollment would reach 9,388.  For the first time in [[1984]], due to a rapidly growing population, Florida Atlantic opened its doors to [[freshmen]] and [[sophomores]].  In 1985, the Downtown Fort Lauderdale campus opened on Las Olas Boulevard.  

In [[1989]], the [[Florida Legislature]] designated Florida Atlantic as the lead state university serving Broward County.  The university also reached $10 million in sponsored research activity for the first time.  Fall semester enrollment was 13,148.  In [[1993]], FAU was elected to the [[National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges]], the nation’s oldest higher education professional association.  The university's intercollegiate teams also joined the [[Atlantic Sun Conference]] and moved to [[NCAA Division I]].  In [[1995]], Florida Atlantic purchased [[Barry University|Barry University’s]] [[Port St. Lucie, Florida|Port St. Lucie]] facility to establish a campus on the [[Treasure Coast]], in partnership with [[Indian River Community College]].  By 1997, sponsored research funding exceeded $24 million.  

In 1999, [[Howard Schnellenberger]], a legendary figure in [[college football]], was named Florida Atlantic’s first head [[american football|football]] coach.  The Barry and Florence Friedberg Lifelong Learning Center opened on the Boca Raton campus.  The [[Jupiter, Florida|Jupiter]] campus also opened and was formally named for the late [[John D. MacArthur]]. [[Image:FAU Baldwin House.jpg|right|thumb|250px|President's Residence at Baldwin House]] Sponsored research funding exceeded $36 million.  By [[2003]], fall semester enrollment was 24,961.  FAU also has maintained the most diverse student body in the State University System, with [[minority]] enrollment of 34.6 percent.

In 2003, the State of Florida awarded FAU $10 million to establish the Center of Excellence in Biomedical and Marine Biotechnology, a research facility that searches the waters off Florida's coastline for drugs from natural sources that could be used to treat [[cancer]], [[heart disease]] and other serious illnesses.  The Lady Owls [[softball]] team won the [[Atlantic Sun Conference]] championship for the seventh time and was listed among the all-time greatest teams in college softball history by the National Fastpitch Coaches Association.  In 2004, FAU admitted its first students to the [[University of Miami]]/Florida Atlantic University [[medical school]] partnership.

Today, FAU's $168 million endowment is roughly double that of some larger state schools in Florida, including the [[University of Central Florida]] and [[Florida International University]]. FAU holds the fourth largest in the state. <ref name="Endowment">{{cite web | url = http://www.palmbeachpost.com/pbcsouth/content/local_news/epaper/2006/10/17/s1b_fauendow_1017.html?cxtype=rss&cxsvc=7&cxcat=17 | title = "Giving to FAU Fourth in State" | publisher = Palm Beach Post | accessdate = 2006-10-17}}</ref>. FAU ranks as one of the less expensive state colleges in Florida, with tuition fees of $3,327 in-state, $16,390 out-of-state, and Room/board of $8,280.[http://www.flbog.org/planning/2006-07Fees.pdf][http://iea.fau.edu/factbk/tuition06.htm] For comparison, the University of Florida has tuition fees of $3,370, University of Central Florida costs $3,432, and Florida State University costs $3,360 for in-state undergraduate tuition fees.[http://www.sfa.ufl.edu/apply/coa.html][http://finaid.ucf.edu/applying/app_costs.html][http://financialaid.fsu.edu/apply/cost_ungrad.html]

The Boca Raton campus remains the largest campus with 69% of FAU's students enrolled there.[http://www.fau.edu/academic/iea/inst/facts.htm] The Boca Raton campus and the Jupiter campus  are the only campuses that offer student housing. 

Since its founding, Florida Atlantic University has had [[List of Presidents of Florida Atlantic University|five presidents]]. President [[Frank T. Brogan]] became the fifth president in 2003 after resigning his position as the [[Lieutenant Governor]] of [[Florida]] under then [[Governor]] [[Jeb Bush]]. Brogan graduated from the [[University of Cincinnati]] and holds a master's degree from Florida Atlantic.

MacArthur campus of FAU in Jupiter, Florida. It offers a rigorous [[liberal arts]] education in the platform of a public institution; students work with a professor to develop and write a substantial honors thesis. The Boca Raton campus houses the University Scholars Program, which offers special honors seminars, forums, courses, and advanced course substitution for freshman.

Florida Atlantic has gradually been increasing its admission standards since it opened its doors to freshman in 1984. However, by 1998 more than one-quarter of Florida Atlantic freshmen were classified as alternative admissions. These students were admitted to ensure diversity in the student body and thus did not meet the state of Florida's minimum admission standards.<ref name="Alt Admissions">{{cite news | last = Klein | first = Barry | title = Some find university doors shut | publisher = St. Petersburg Times Online  | date = 1998-06-12 | url = http://www.sptimes.com/State/120698/Some_find_university_2.html | accessdate = 2007-05-25}}</ref> Starting in the summer of 2004, FAU began denying entry to students with low GPA's and [[SAT]] scores. Prospective students were forced to take remedial courses at a [[community college]] before being accepted to the university. The raised admissions standards included a goal of a 3.2 [[GPA]] and an SAT score of at least 1000 for admittance in 2007.<ref name="Admissions Standards"/> By 2007, the average high school GPA for an entering freshman was 3.3 and a 1052 on the SAT.<ref name="Facts"/> 

Today, the average class size for undergraduates is 32 people, and 11 people for graduate classes. Student to Faculty ratio is 19:1. The top three undergraduate majors by enrollment are Elementary [[Education]], [[Management]], and [[Accounting]], respectively. The top three graduate majors by enrollment are [[Business Administration]], [[Nursing]], and [[Educational Leadership]]. The average age for first time in college students is 18, however, the average age for all undergraduates is 25. The average age for graduate students is 34.<ref name="Facts"/>
