In [[computer science]] and [[mathematics]], a '''sorting algorithm''' is an [[algorithm]] that puts elements of a [[List (computing)|list]] in a certain [[Total order|order]]. The   most-used orders are numerical order and [[lexicographical order]]. Efficient [[sorting]] is important to optimizing the use of other algorithms (such as [[search algorithm|search]] and [[merge algorithm|merge]] algorithms) that require sorted lists to work correctly; it is also often useful for [[Canonicalization|canonicalizing]] data and for producing human-readable output. More formally, the output must satisfy two conditions:

# The output is in nondecreasing order (each element is no smaller than the previous element according to the desired [[total order]]);
# The output is a [[permutation]], or reordering, of the input.

Since the dawn of computing, the sorting problem has attracted a great deal of research, perhaps due to the complexity of solving it efficiently despite its simple, familiar statement. For example, [[bubble sort]] was analyzed as early as 1956.<ref>http://www.cs.duke.edu/~ola/papers/bubble.pdf</ref> Although many consider it a solved problem, useful new sorting algorithms are still being invented to this day (for example, [[library sort]] was first published in 2004). Sorting algorithms are prevalent in introductory computer science classes, where the abundance of algorithms for the problem provides a gentle introduction to a variety of core algorithm concepts, such as [[big O notation]], [[divide-and-conquer algorithm]]s, [[data structure]]s, [[randomized algorithm]]s, [[best, worst and average case]] analysis, [[time-space tradeoff]]s, and lower bounds.

== Classification ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Merge sort]] -->
Sorting algorithms used in [[computer science]] are often classified by:

* Computational [[Computational complexity theory|complexity]] ([[Worst-case performance|worst]], [[Average performance|average]] and [[Best-case performance|best]] behaviour) of element comparisons in terms of the size of the list (''n''). For typical sorting algorithms good behavior is [[Big O notation|O]](''n''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''n'') and bad behavior is Ω(''n''²). (See [[Big O notation]]) Ideal behavior for a sort is O(''n''). Sort algorithms which only use an abstract key comparison operation always need Ω(''n''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''n'') comparisons in the worst case.
* Computational [[Computational complexity theory|complexity]] of swaps (for "in place" algorithms).
* Memory usage (and use of other computer resources). In particular, some sorting algorithms are "[[In-place algorithm|in place]]", such that only O(1) or O(log n) memory is needed beyond the items being sorted, while others need to create auxiliary locations for data to be temporarily stored.
* Recursion.  Some algorithms are either recursive or non recursive, while others may be both (e.g., merge sort).
* Stability: '''stable sorting algorithms''' maintain the relative order of records with equal keys (''i.e.'' values). See below for more information. 
* Whether or not they are a [[comparison sort]]. A comparison sort examines the data only by comparing two elements with a comparison operator.
* General method: insertion, exchange, selection, merging, ''etc''. Exchange sorts include bubble sort and quicksort. Selection sorts include shaker sort and heapsort.

==== Stability ====
''Stable sorting algorithms'' maintain the relative order of {{ml|Strict weak ordering||records with equal keys}} (''i.e.'' sort key values).
That is, a sorting algorithm is ''stable'' if whenever there are two records ''R'' and ''S'' with the same key and with ''R'' appearing before ''S'' in the original list, ''R'' will appear before ''S'' in the sorted list. 

When equal elements are indistinguishable, such as with integers, or more generally, any data where the entire element is the key, stability is not an issue. However, assume that the following pairs of numbers are to be sorted by their first component:

 (4, 1)  (3, 7)  (3, 1)  (5, 6)

In this case, two different results are possible, one which maintains the relative order of records with equal keys, and one which does not:

 (3, 7)  (3, 1)  (4, 1)  (5, 6)   (order maintained)
 (3, 1)  (3, 7)  (4, 1)  (5, 6)   (order changed)

Unstable sorting algorithms may change the relative order of records with equal keys, but stable sorting algorithms never do so. Unstable sorting algorithms can be specially implemented to be stable. One way of doing this is to artificially extend the key comparison, so that comparisons between two objects with otherwise equal keys are decided using the order of the entries in the original data order as a tie-breaker. Remembering this order, however, often involves an additional space cost.

Sorting based on a primary, secondary, tertiary, etc. sort key can be done by any sorting method, taking all sort keys into account in comparisons (in other words, using a single composite sort key). If a sorting method is stable, it is also possible to sort multiple times, each time with one sort key. In that case the keys need to be applied in order of increasing priority.

Example: sorting pairs of numbers as above by first, then second component:

 (4, 1)  (3, 7)  (3, 1)  (4, 6) (original)

 (4, 1)  (3, 1)  (4, 6)  (3, 7) (after sorting by second component)
 (3, 1)  (3, 7)  (4, 1)  (4, 6) (after sorting by first component)

On the other hand:

 (3, 7)  (3, 1)  (4, 1)  (4, 6) (after sorting by first component)
 (3, 1)  (4, 1)  (4, 6)  (3, 7) (after sorting by second component, order by first component is disrupted)

== List of sorting algorithms ==
In this table, ''n'' is the number of records to be sorted. The columns "Average" and "Worst" give the time complexity in each case, under the assumption that the length of each key is constant, and that therefore all comparisons, swaps, and other needed operations can proceed in constant time. "Memory" denotes the amount of auxiliary storage needed beyond that used by the list itself, under the same assumption. These are all [[comparison sort]]s.

== Summaries of popular sorting algorithms ==
=== Bubble sort ===
{{main|Bubble sort}}
''Bubble sort'' is a straightforward and simplistic method of sorting data that is used in computer science education. The algorithm starts at the beginning of the data set. It compares the first two elements, and if the first is greater than the second, it swaps them. It continues doing this for each pair of adjacent elements to the end of the data set. It then starts again with the first two elements, repeating until no swaps have occurred on the last pass. While simple, this algorithm is highly inefficient and is rarely used except in education. A slightly better variant, [[cocktail sort]], works by inverting the ordering criteria and the pass direction on alternating passes.
Its average case and worst case is same O(n^2).

=== Selection sort ===
{{main|Selection sort}}
''Selection sort'' is a simple sorting algorithm that improves on the performance of bubble sort. It works by first finding the smallest element using a linear scan and swapping it into the first position in the list, then finding the second smallest element by scanning the remaining elements, and so on. Selection sort is unique compared to almost any other algorithm in that its running time is not affected by the prior ordering of the list: it performs the same number of operations because of its simple structure. Selection sort also requires only ''n'' swaps, and hence just Θ(''n'') memory writes, which is optimal for any sorting algorithm. Thus it can be very attractive if writes are the most expensive operation, but otherwise selection sort will usually be outperformed by insertion sort or the more complicated algorithms.

=== Insertion sort ===
{{main|Insertion sort}}
''Insertion sort'' is a simple sorting algorithm that is relatively efficient for small lists and mostly-sorted lists, and often is used as part of more sophisticated algorithms. It works by taking elements from the list one by one and inserting them in their correct position into a new sorted list. In arrays, the new list and the remaining elements can share the array's space, but insertion is expensive, requiring shifting all following elements over by one. The insertion sort works just like its name suggests - it inserts each item into its proper place in the final list. The simplest implementation of this requires two list structures - the source list and the list into which sorted items are inserted. To save memory, most implementations use an in-place sort that works by moving the current item past the already sorted items and repeatedly swapping it with the preceding item until it is in place. [[Shell sort]] (see below) is a variant of insertion sort that is more efficient for larger lists. This method is much more efficient than the bubble sort, though it has more constraints.

=== Shell sort ===
{{main|Shell sort}}
''Shell sort'' was invented by [[Donald Shell]] in [[1959]]. It improves upon bubble sort and insertion sort by moving out of order elements more than one position at a time. One implementation can be described as arranging the data sequence in a two-dimensional array and then sorting the columns of the array using insertion sort. Although this method is inefficient for large data sets, it is one of the fastest algorithms for sorting small numbers of elements (sets with less than 1000 or so elements). Another advantage of this algorithm is that it requires relatively small amounts of memory.

=== Merge sort ===
{{main|Merge sort}}
''Merge sort'' takes advantage of the ease of merging already sorted lists into a new sorted list. It starts by comparing every two elements (''i.e.'' 1 with 2, then 3 with 4...) and swapping them if the first should come after the second. It then merges each of the resulting lists of two into lists of four, then merges those lists of four, and so on; until at last two lists are merged into the final sorted list. Of the algorithms described here, this is the first that scales well to very large lists.

=== Heapsort ===
{{main|Heapsort}}
''Heapsort'' is a much more efficient version of [[selection sort]]. It also works by determining the largest (or smallest) element of the list, placing that at the end (or beginning) of the list, then continuing with the rest of the list, but accomplishes this task efficiently by using a data structure called a [[heap (data structure)|heap]], a special type of [[binary tree]]. Once the data list has been made into a heap, the root node is guaranteed to be the largest element. When it is removed and placed at the end of the list, the heap is rearranged so the largest element remaining moves to the root. Using the heap, finding the next largest element takes ''O(log n)'' time, instead of ''O(n)'' for a linear scan as in simple selection sort. This allows Heapsort to run in ''O(n log n)'' time.

=== Quicksort ===
{{main|Quicksort}}
''Quicksort'' is a [[divide and conquer algorithm|divide and conquer]] [[algorithm]] which relies on a ''partition'' operation: to partition an array, we choose an element, called a ''pivot'', move all smaller elements before the pivot, and move all greater elements after it. This can be done efficiently in linear time and [[in-place algorithm|in-place]]. We then recursively sort the lesser and greater sublists. Efficient implementations of quicksort (with in-place partitioning) are typically unstable sorts and somewhat complex, but are among the fastest sorting algorithms in practice. Together with its modest O(log ''n'') space usage, this makes quicksort one of the most popular sorting algorithms, available in many standard libraries. The most complex issue in quicksort is choosing a good pivot element; consistently poor choices of pivots can result in drastically slower (O(''n''²)) performance, but if at each step we choose the ''median'' as the pivot then it works in O(''n''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''n'').

===Bucket sort===
{{main|Bucket sort}}
Bucket sort is a sorting algorithm that works by partitioning an array into a finite number of buckets. Each bucket is then sorted individually, either using a different sorting algorithm, or by recursively applying the bucket sorting algorithm.

=== Radix sort ===
{{main|Radix sort}}
''Radix sort'' is an algorithm that sorts a list of fixed-size numbers of length ''k'' in O(''n'' · ''k'') time by treating them as bit strings. We first sort the list by the least significant bit while preserving their relative order using a stable sort. Then we sort them by the next bit, and so on from right to left, and the list will end up sorted. Most often, the [[counting sort]] algorithm is used to accomplish the bitwise sorting, since the number of values a bit can have is small.

== Memory usage patterns and index sorting ==
When the size of the array to be sorted approaches or exceeds the available primary memory, so that (much slower) disk or swap space must be employed, the memory usage pattern of a sorting algorithm becomes important, and an algorithm that might have been fairly efficient when the array fit easily in RAM may become impractical. In this scenario, the total number of comparisons becomes (relatively) less important, and the number of times sections of memory must be copied or swapped to and from the disk can dominate the performance characteristics of an algorithm. Thus, the number of passes and the localization of comparisons can be more important than the raw number of comparisons, since comparisons of nearby elements to one another happen at [[computer bus|system bus]] speed (or, with caching, even at [[Central Processing Unit|CPU]] speed), which, compared to disk speed, is virtually instantaneous.

For example, the popular recursive [[quicksort]] algorithm provides quite reasonable performance with adequate RAM, but due to the recursive way that it copies portions of the array it becomes much less practical when the array does not fit in RAM, because it may cause a number of slow copy or move operations to and from disk. In that scenario, another algorithm may be preferable even if it requires more total comparisons.

One way to work around this problem, which works well when complex records (such as in a [[relational database]]) are being sorted by a relatively small key field, is to create an index into the array and then sort the index, rather than the entire array. (A sorted version of the entire array can then be produced with one pass, reading from the index, but often even that is unnecessary, as having the sorted index is adequate.)  Because the index is much smaller than the entire array, it may fit easily in memory where the entire array would not, effectively eliminating the disk-swapping problem. This procedure is sometimes called "tag sort".<ref>http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=tag+sort&i=52532,00.asp</ref>

Another technique for overcoming the memory-size problem is to combine two algorithms in a way that takes advantages of the strength of each to improve overall performance. For instance, the array might be subdivided into chunks of a size that will fit easily in RAM (say, a few thousand elements), the chunks sorted using an efficient algorithm (such as [[quicksort]] or [[heapsort]]), and the results merged as per [[mergesort]]. This is more efficient than just doing mergesort in the first place, but it requires less physical RAM (to be practical) than a full quicksort on the whole array.

Techniques can also be combined. For sorting very large sets of data that vastly exceed system memory, even the index may need to be sorted using an algorithm or combination of algorithms designed to perform reasonably with [[virtual memory]], ''i.e.'', to reduce the amount of swapping required.

* [[Boston College]] has a ''[http://vision.bc.edu/~dmartin/teaching/sorting/anim-html/all.html graphical demonstration]'' of various sorting algorithms with various initial conditions.

Microsoft's "Quick" programming languages (such as [[QuickBASIC]] and [[QuickPascal]]) have a file named "sortdemo" (with extension BAS and PAS for QB and QP, respectively) in the examples folder that provides a graphical representation of several of the various sort procedures described here, as well as performance ratings of each.

== Language support ==
Most languages have built-in support for sorting. These implementations typically use a single algorithm tuned for high-performance in-memory sorting, and for this application it's usually strongly preferred to writing one's own sorting algorithm. Quicksort is a frequent choice, but heapsort and mergesort are also popular. Here are some of the most well-known:

* [[C (programming language)|C]] includes <code>qsort()</code>, a standard library function that can perform an arbitrary comparison sort on an array of objects using a comparison operator passed in as a function pointer. Its implementation is usually, although not required to be, based on quicksort. While flexible, the overhead of invoking the frequently-used comparison operator via a function pointer is often prohibitive as it cannot be [[in-line expansion|inlined]]. (Ref ISO/IEC 9899:1999(E), section 7.20.5.2, or ANSI/ISO 9899:1990, section 7.10.5.2).
* [[C++]] retains <code>qsort()</code> but adds the templated [[Standard Template Library|STL]] function <code>std::sort</code> which sorts the range between two random-access iterators. In addition, the <code>std::list</code> (linked list) class, which doesn't have random access, has its own <code>sort</code> method. The type of the elements sorted must support the < operator, or you must provide it with a custom comparator. In addition to added type safety, it often outperforms <code>qsort()</code>, particularly when the comparison operation is cheap. C++ also provides <code>stable_sort</code> and <code>partial_sort</code> (Ref sections 25.3 and 25.4 of ISO/IEC 14882:2003(E) and 14882:1998(E)).
* [[Borland Delphi|Delphi]] includes the <code>TList</code> object that provides a <code>Sort</code> function that can be applied to any data. The comparison function must be given to the <code>Sort</code> procedure, and the data is sorted with a quicksort accordingly.
* The [[Java (programming language)|Java]] classes {{Javadoc:SE|java/util|Arrays}} and {{Javadoc:SE|java/util|Collections}} (both available in 1.2 and later) include overloaded <code>sort()</code> static methods that operate on arrays and Lists, respectively. They must be arrays of primitives, or the arrays or Lists must be of a type that implements the <code>Comparable</code> interface, or you must specify a custom Comparator object. The sorting algorithm used is a slightly optimized merge sort algorithm that is fast and stable. This algorithm offers guaranteed n*log(n) performance and runs much faster on substantially sorted lists.<ref>http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/collections/algorithms/index.html#sorting</ref>
* The [[.NET Framework]] supplies the static method <code>Array.Sort()</code> which can sort an array of objects using an arbitrary comparator.<ref>http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfsystemarrayclasssorttopic.asp</ref>
Although the algorithm is not documented, simple reverse engineering shows that Microsoft's implementation uses quicksort.{{Fact|date=August 2007}} .NET additionally supplies a <code>Sort()</code> method on the <code>ArrayList</code> class, which also uses quicksort.<ref>http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfSystemCollectionsArrayListClassSortTopic.asp</ref>
The new generic <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> also provides sorting capabilities.<ref>http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/3da4abas.aspx</ref>
* [[Perl]] provides a built-in <code>sort</code> function that can take a comparator function which returns negative, zero, or positive integers to indicate less, equal, or greater, respectively.<ref>http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/sort.html</ref> It used quicksort in version 5.6 and earlier and afterwards used a somewhat slower stable mergesort algorithm.  A primary motivation for choosing mergesort was security: Perl is a very popular language for writing web applications, so if its sorting algorithm has poor worst-case behavior then an attacker might supply input that was deliberately constructed to cause such behavior as part of a denial-of-service attack.  Mergesort is somewhat less efficient than quicksort with typical input data, but unlike quicksort has no pathological cases. The module Sort::Key::Radix <ref>http://search.cpan.org/~salva/Sort-Key-Radix/</ref> provides an efficient implementation of the [[Radix sort]] algorithm.
* [[Python (programming language)|Python]] provides both a built-in <code>sorted</code> function to sort arbitrary [[iterables]] and a <code>sort</code> method for in-place sorting of lists. Python's built in sorting uses an adaptive, stable mergesort.
* [[Standard ML]] has no built-in support for sorting, but the SML/NJ library included with [[Standard ML of New Jersey]] supplies an efficient <code>ArrayQSortFn</code> functor for sorting arrays with quicksort.<ref>http://www.smlnj.org/doc/smlnj-lib/Manual/array-qsort-fn.html</ref>
* [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] provides a sort function for lists (but not for arrays). Its behavior is specified in terms of insertion sort, but any stable implementation is permitted.<ref>http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/list.html#sect17.3</ref>
* [[Ocaml]] provides three sorting functions for both arrays and lists, named <code>sort</code>, <code>stable_sort</code>, and <code>fast_sort</code>, where the last is just whichever of the first two is generally faster. They all provide a guarantee of constant heap space and logarithmic stack space usage.<ref>http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/List.html#6_Sorting</ref><ref>http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Array.html#6_Sorting</ref>
In earlier versions it used a separate <code>Sort</code> module.
* The [[Common Lisp]] specification defines in section 17.3 two functions SORT and STABLE-SORT which destructively (that is, using mutation) but efficiently sort sequences. Any suitable implementation is permitted. [http://www.lisp.org/HyperSpec/Body/fun_sortcm_stable-sort.html]
* [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] implements a <code>sort</code> method for arrays that is a C [[quicksort]].  Any object that implements a method which yields successive members (<code>each</code>), and a method for comparing the members (<code><=></code>), may be sorted with the sort method by mixing in the Enumerable module.
* [[D (programming language)|D]] provides a built in sort method for arrays that is a [[quicksort]].

== Proof of the lower bound for the asymptotic running time of comparison sort algorithms ==

The worst case running time of any comparison sort algorithm is <math>\Omega(n \lg n)</math>

:Let <math> T </math> be the decision tree for all possible comparisons between elements of a list <math>X[1\dots n]</math>. So <math>T</math> is complete and the label of each vertex <math> v </math> of the tree are of the form <math> x_i : x_j </math> and <math> v </math> is source of two edges labeled <math> \ge </math> and <math> < </math>. The comparisons made by a sorting algorithm running over <math> X</math> corresponds to a path from the root of <math> T </math> to a leaf. One should note that for each possible permutation <math> P</math> of the elements in <math> X </math> there is such a path. So <math>T</math> has at least <math>n!</math> leaves. We know that <math>T</math> is a binary tree, so it has a maximum of <math>2^h</math> leaves, where <math>h</math> is it's height. We have <math>2^h  \ge  n!</math> and
 <math> 
\begin{array}{ccl}
\lg(2^h) & = & h\\
 & \ge & \lg(n!)\\
& = & \lg (n\times (n - 1)\dots 2)\\
& \ge & \lg (\underbrace{\frac{n}{2}\times \frac{n}{2} \dots \frac{n}{2}}_{\frac{n}{2} times})\\
& = & \lg (\frac{n}{2}^\frac{n}{2})\\
& = & \frac{n}{2} \lg (n) - 1\\
& \ge & \frac{1}{4}n \lg n
\end{array}
</math>.
Summarizing, <math> h = \Omega(n\lg n)</math>
