'''Hurricane Lane''' was the strongest hurricane to make landfall in [[Mexico]] since [[Hurricane Kenna]] of [[2002 Pacific hurricane season|2002]].<ref name="epachurdat">{{cite web|author=Hurricane Research Division|year=2006|title=Hurricane Data for Pacific Hurricanes 1949-2005|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=2006-12-11|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/tracks1949to2005_epa.txt}}</ref> The thirteenth named storm, ninth hurricane, and sixth major hurricane of the [[2006 Pacific hurricane season]] in the Eastern Pacific, Lane developed from a [[tropical wave]] on [[September 13]] to the south of Mexico. It moved northwestward parallel to the coast of Mexico, and steadily intensified in an area of favorable conditions. After turning to the northeast, Lane attained peak winds of 125&nbsp;mph (205&nbsp;km/h), and made landfall in the [[Mexico|Mexican state]] of [[Sinaloa]] at peak strength. It rapidly weakened and dissipated on [[September 17]].

Throughout its path, Lane resulted in four deaths and moderate damage. Damage was heaviest in [[Sinaloa]] where the hurricane made landfall, including severe crop damage. Across Mexico, an estimated 4,320&nbsp;homes were impacted by the hurricane, with about 248,000&nbsp;people affected. Moderate flooding was reported in [[Acapulco]], resulting in mudslides in some areas. Damage across the country totaled $2.2&nbsp;billion (2006&nbsp;[[MXN]], $203&nbsp;million (2006&nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD]]).

As Lane came closer to the Mexican coastline, all the [[seaport]]s between [[Michoacán]] and [[Sinaloa]] were closed, and the ''Servicio Meteorológico Nacional'' (National Meteorological Service, in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) warned the general population about the threat of [[flood]]ing and [[landslide]]s.

==Impact==

In [[Acapulco]], the storm produced strong waves and heavy rain, leaving coastal streets with up to 16&nbsp;inches (405&nbsp;mm) of water. The heavy rainfall flooded 200 houses and caused a mudslide, resulting in the death of a 7 year-old boy. Flooding also occurred at the airport in Acapulco, though service was not interrupted. Offshore, strong waves capsized a boat, leaving one person missing. Heavy rainfall in the [[Michoacán]] city of [[Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán|Lázaro Cárdenas]] overflowed a canal, forcing over 500 people to evacuate their homes.<ref name="lane"/> 500&nbsp;acres (2&nbsp;km²) of crops were destroyed by Lane in Michoacán.
