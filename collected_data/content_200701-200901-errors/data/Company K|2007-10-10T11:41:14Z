'''''Company K''''' is a [[1933]] [[novel]] by [[William March]], first [[Serial (literature)|serial]]ised in parts in the [[New York]] Magazine ''[[Forum (magazine)|Forum]]'' from [[1930]] to [[1932]], and published in its entirety by [[Random House|Smith and Haas]] on January 19, [[1933]], in [[New York]]. The books title was taken from the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] [[Company (military unit)|company]] that [[William March|March]] served in during [[World War I]].  It is has been regarded as one of the most significant works of literature to come out of the [[United States|American]] [[World War I]] experience and the most reprinted of all [[William March|March's]] work.

==Plot summary==
The novel comprises 123 vignettes about [[World War I]] soldiers in Company K.  The [[novel]] is told from the viewpoint of 123 different soldiers, stretching from the beginning of training to the end of the [[war]].  These sketches create contrasting and horrific accounts of the daily life endured by the common [[soldier]].  Many of the accounts stem from actual events witnessed and experienced by the author.  

It has often been described as an anti-militarist and an [[anti-war]] [[novel]], but [[William March|March]] maintained that the content was based on truth and should be viewed as an affirmation of life.

==Literary significance & criticism==
''[[Company K (March)|Company K]]'' was hailed as a masterpiece by critics and writers alike.  Writing as a literary critic for the [[Spectator]], the writer [[Graham Greene]] places it among the most important of all [[war]] novels, stating: 
:"His book has the force of a mob-protest; an outcry from anonymous throats. The wheel turns and turns and it does not matter, one hardly notices that the captain of the company, killed on page 159, is alive again a hundred pages later. It does not matter that every stock situation of the war, suicide, the murder of an officer, the slaughter of prisoners, a vision of Christ, is apportioned to [[Company K (March)|Company K]], because the book is not written in any realistic convention. It is the only War-book I have read which has found a new form to fit the novelty of the protest. The prose is bare, lucid, without literary echoes, not an imitation but a development of eighteenth-century prose."<ref>From the 1988 book ''William March: an annotated checklist'' by Roy S. Simmonds, p. 120</ref> 

The journalist and writer [[Christopher Morley]] had an almost identical response to [[Company K (March)|Company K]] after reading an advanced copy, stating:
:"It's queer about this book--it suddenly made me wonder whether any other book about the War has been written in this country.  It's a book of extra-ordinary courage--not the courage of hope but the quiet courage of despair.  It will make patriots and romanticists angry--yet it is the kind of patriotism that is hardest and toughest.  It ranks at once with the few great cries of protest.  It is a selected, partial, bitter picture, but a picture we need.  It will live.  None of the acts of bravery for which the author was decorated during the War was as brave as this anthology of dismay."<ref>From the 1988 book ''William March: an annotated checklist'' by Roy S. Simmonds, p. 4</ref>   

''[[Company K (March)|Company K]]'' has often been compared to [[Erich Maria Remarque]]'s classic [[anti-war]] novel "[[All Quiet on the Western Front]]" for its hopeless view of [[war]]. The professor and author Philip Beidler wrote: 
:"the act of writing Company K, in effect reliving his very painful memories, was itself an act of tremendous courage, equal to or greater than whatever it was that earned him the Distinguished Service Cross, Navy Cross and French Croix de Guerre".<ref>From the 1989 introduction to ''Company K: with an introduction by Philip D. Beidler'' by Philip D. Beidler</ref>

Years after the completion of ''Company K'', [[Ernest Hemingway]] compiled and published the novel ''[[Men At War: The Best War Stories of All Time]]'', in the introduction Hemingway notes that of all the stories published in the novel, the two he most desired to publish were omitted, Andre Malraux's ''[[Man's Fate]]'' and William March's ''Nine Prisoners'', one of the original serialized excerpts from ''Company K''.  Hemingway states that the anti-war aspects of the stories would not bode well, as the novel coincides with the beginnings of [[World War II]].  He further states:
:"Since the military problem, which was by no means clearly presented in the story, will undoubtedly arise many times in this war, I thought the story should be omitted from this book for the duration of the war.  After the war, if a new edition of this book is published, I should strongly advise that the story be included."<ref>From the 1942 introduction of [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s ''Men At War: The Best War Stories of All Time'', p. xxx</ref>

==Film, TV or theatrical adaptations==
A [[film]] adaptation of the same name was made in [[2004]].  It was written and directed by [[Robert Clem]] from the [[William March|March]] novel and stars [[Ari Fliakos]].
