__TOC__

==Synopsis==
{{spoiler}}
When [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] complains he never gets any mail, [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] gives him the family's [[junk mail]]. Bart is only interested in a [[credit card]] [[solicitation]] from MoneyBank. He fills out the application, and when pressed for a name, he uses [[Santa's Little Helper]] (the company reads the name as "Santos L. Halper"). Amazingly, the credit card application is approved, and before long, Bart is sporting his very own credit card.

Bart – blissfully ignorant at how credit works – goes on a shopping spree, buying the family some very expensive gifts from a mail order catalog: [[Vancouver]] smoked [[salmon]] and a [[radio]]-frying pan for Marge, a [[golf]] shirt with corporate logo for Homer, "Trucker's Choice Stay-Alert Capsules" for Lisa ... and plenty of toys and clothing for himself. Lisa is immediately suspicious, but Bart takes advantage of his sister being high on pills and explains his way out of her questions.

The best item of all that Bart buys with his fraudulent credit card: A finely-bred, pre-trained [[collie]], of which only 800 will be born. Not letting its $1,200 purchase price stand in the way, Bart promptly orders one with his credit card. Before long, a crate with his new dog arrives. An overjoyed Bart learns the dog's name is Laddie, and [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and Marge – still not suspicious about Bart's recent spending spree – falls in love with the dog, who can herd [[sheep]] and perform [[CPR]].

Bart fails to pay off "Santos L. Halper's" credit card bill, and it isn't long before he gets a call from a [[collection agency]] demanding payment. When the calls and collection letters persist, Bart has enough and enlists Laddie to help him bury his ill-gotten credit card. Later, repo men arrive to take back all the merchandise. [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] – who is the only one home – demands an explanation, and Bart is forced to admit the truth. When a repossessor demands the $1,200 dog, Bart identifies Santa's Little Helper as the dog they're after. The greyhound is herded into the truck, and Bart sadly watches as it drives away.

Noticing that Santa's Little Helper is gone, the family begins to bond with Laddie ... except for Bart, who begins to miss his canine friend. He fears for Santa's Little Helper's fate, at one point imagining him being burned alive in a cruise ship's furnace. An exhausted Bart is giving Laddie yet another walk, when the collie saves the life of the [[List of recurring characters from The Simpsons#Baby Gerald|unibrow baby]].

At a ceremony honoring Laddie's heroism, [[Chief Wiggum]] decides that Laddie would make the perfect [[police dog]]. Bart gives him away, and now Bart is forced to explain why the Simpsons now have no dog. Homer makes Bart do whatever it takes to get Santa's Little Helper back. Bart eventually learns from [[Reverend Timothy Lovejoy|Rev. Lovejoy]] that the dog was given to a parishioner named Mr. Mitchell.

Bart visits Mr. Mitchell, who is blind, and asks for his dog back, but when he sees how the man and Santa's Little Helper (who has been renamed Sprinkles) have bonded, a heartsick Bart leaves. Bart, still determined to get his dog back, makes a late-night, unannounced visit to Mr. Mitchell's home. Bart and Santa's Little Helper are reunited, but Mr. Mitchell eventually traps Bart in a closet. He calls the police and wants Bart charged with burglary, but Chief Wiggum has brought along Laddie, who immediately sniffs out a [[marijuana]] packet in Mr. Mitchell's pocket.

Chief Wiggum begins to read Mr. Mitchell his rights, when [[List of recurring characters from The Simpsons#Eddie and Lou|Eddie]] remarks about medicinal uses of the drug. After sending Bart away with Santa's Little Helper, Chief Wiggum declares its time to party as the [[Bob Marley]] song '[[Exodus (album)|Jamming]]' plays over the end credits.

* The episode title is a play on the [[1951]] [[Herman Wouk]] novel ''[[The Caine Mutiny]]'' and the subesequent [[Humphrey Bogart]] [[The Caine Mutiny (film)|movie]].
* The dog "Laddie" is a play on [[Lassie]], in terms of name, appearance (resembling a [[Rough Collie]]) and uncanny intelligence.
* The notion of dogs mistakenly being issued major credit cards was previously mentioned in "[[Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming]]".  A real-life incident followed the episode in 2004, when a man replied who signed up to an e-mail list using his dog's name received a credit card in this name.

* In 2006, and Australian woman got two credit cards out in the name of her cat.
* Marge listens to the song "[[You Really Got Me]]" by [[The Kinks]] played on the frying pan radio. This is the only [[The Kinks]] song that has been on the show as to date(confirmed by DVD commentary).
* Bart is seen playing with a [[Pachinko]] machine among all the stuff he purchased.
* The scene in which [[Santa's Little Helper]] has to choose between [[Bart]] and Mr. Mitchell is very similar to a pivotal scene in ''[[Air Bud]]'', which was released several months after this episode.
* Mr. Burns believes Laddie is a member of [[Skull and Bones]], a secret organization based at [[Yale University]].
* At the end of the episode, the song "[[Exodus (album)|Jammin]]" by [[Bob Marley]] is played (with a clearly-doped Wiggum and Lou attempting to sing along).
