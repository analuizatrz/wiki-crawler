'''Troy McClure''' was a [[fictional character]] in the [[television]] [[cartoon]] series ''[[The Simpsons]]'', voiced by [[Phil Hartman]]. After Hartman's murder in 1998, the character was retired (along with Hartman's other recurring character, [[Lionel Hutz]]). His character last appeared in season 10's third episode, "[[Bart the Mother]]". Troy McClure's narrative delivery is reminiscent of documentary narrators from the 70's such as [[William Conrad]]. He is well known from his saying:
"Hi, I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such ... as..."

== Profile ==

Troy McClure is based on a stereotypical [[Hollywood]] [[has-been]]; he is a ubiquitous presenter of educational videos, voiceovers, and [[infomercial]]s. At one stage he had a modestly successful acting career. When introducing the latest product he is paid to add his clean-cut good looks and smooth voice to, he is quick to remind the viewing audience of his previous career with his standard introduction "Hi, I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such [films, educational videos, voiceovers, etc.] as..." and will mention two humorous titles of the same subject. Many of the movies he cites as having appeared in frequently possess (often amusingly-titled) [[B-movie|B-grade titles]] that are unlikely to have been [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning material. He has narrated [[propaganda]] for everyone from the beef industry to health farms to the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]].

McClure's career reportedly went downhill due to his unusual [[paraphilia]], which apparently involved [[fish]] (see [[zoophilia]]), to the point where he had not worked in twelve years. To cover this up, a marriage was arranged between himself and [[Marge Simpson|Marge]]'s sister [[Selma Bouvier|Selma]], which briefly revived his career, and he went on to star in ''Stop the Planet of the Apes, I Want to Get Off!'' (see: ''[[Stop the World - I Want to Get Off]]''), a musical version of the film ''[[Planet of the Apes]]'' (the episode was made well before the [[2001]] remake of the movie).  Although Selma accepted the sham marriage, she drew the line when McClure's agent suggested that they have a child. 

His name is an amalgam of [[B-movie]] actors [[Troy Donahue]] and [[Doug McClure]]. In the earlier seasons of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' he is called Kevin McClure (e.g., the commercial in the beginning of the episode "[[Marge in Chains]]"). McClure drives a [[De Lorean DMC-12]] and lives in an "ultramodern" house strongly reminiscent of the [[Chemosphere]].

Before his untimely death, [[Phil Hartman]] had always wanted to do a live action movie about McClure. Several of the show's writers (including Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein) mentioned in ''Simpsons'' DVD commentaries that they would have loved to do it.

In character, McClure bears a resemblance to [[Futurama]]'s [[Zapp Brannigan]], who was originally supposed to have been voiced by [[Phil Hartman]] before he died.

After Hartman's death, McClure was retired from the show with no explanation. However, in the Simpsons' 2nd episode guide ''The Simpsons Forever!'', a tribute to McClure listing all his known appearances is featured, though it never once mentions his fate. Despite the character's retirement, McClure still occasionally appears via flashbacks, clip shows, and crowd scenes. Information films in a similar vein to McClure's continue to appear (for instance, in ''[[Goo Goo Gai Pan]]'' and ''[[On a Clear Day I Can't See My Sister]]'').

IGN ranked him 1st in their list of the 25 greatest Simpsons side characters.
