}}The '''Brisbane Broncos''' are an Australian professional [[rugby league]] club based in the city of [[Brisbane, Queensland]]. The Broncos play in Australasia's elite competition, the [[National Rugby League|National Rugby League]] (NRL) premiership. The Broncos have won six premierships during their twenty years in competition, making them the league's most successful club.

The club was founded in 1988 as part of the [[New South Wales Rugby League premiership]]'s national expansion, becoming, along with the [[Gold Coast-Tweed Giants]], one of Queensland's first two participants in the [[Winfield Cup]]. The Broncos later played a significant role in the [[Super League War]] of the mid-1990s before continuing to compete successfully in the reunified National Rugby League competition of today.

The Broncos are based in the Brisbane suburb of [[Red Hill, Queensland|Red Hill]] where their training ground and Leagues club are located, but they play their home games at [[Milton, Queensland|Milton]]'s [[Suncorp Stadium]]. They are also the only publicly listed sporting club on the [[Australian Stock Exchange]], trading as Brisbane Broncos Limited ({{asx|BBL}}). The parent company of the Brisbane Broncos is Nationwide News Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of [[News Limited]], which as of 27 February 2007, owns 68.83% of Broncos shares.<ref>{{cite web | title=Brisbane Broncos 2006 Annual Report (Page 25)|url=http://www.broncos.com.au/Content/Attachment/Brisbane%20Broncos%20Limited%202006%20Annual%20Report.pdf| accessdate=2007-04-22}} </ref>

==History==
{{Main|Brisbane Broncos History}}
Queensland’s success in the 1980s' [[Rugby League State of Origin|State of Origin]], in addition to the inclusion of a Combined Brisbane team in the [[Amco Cup|mid-week competition]], convinced the New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) to invite a Queensland-based team into the competition.<ref name="broncshistory">{{cite book | author=Whiticker, Alan & Collis, Ian | title= The History of Rugby League Clubs
| publisher=New Holland Publishers (Australia) Pty Ltd | year=2004| id=ISBN 1-74110-075-5}}</ref> After tough competition between the various syndicates for the Brisbane license, the [[Queensland Rugby League]] chose the bid of former [[Brisbane Rugby League]] players, [[Barry Maranta]] and [[Paul "Porky" Morgan]].<ref name="broncshistory">{{cite book | author=Whiticker, Alan & Collis, Ian | title= The History of Rugby League Clubs

The Broncos secured the services of [[Australian Kangaroos]] captain [[Wally Lewis]] and former [[BRL]] coach [[Wayne Bennett (rugby league)|Wayne Bennett]], who remains the club's coach 20 years later.<ref name="broncshistory">{{cite book | author=Whiticker, Alan & Collis, Ian | title= The History of Rugby League Clubs

[[Brisbane Broncos 1989|In 1989]] they won the midweek knockout competition, the [[Panasonic Cup]]. The club first tasted [[Brisbane Broncos 1992#1992 Grand Final|premiership success in 1992]], and [[Brisbane Broncos 1993#1993 Grand Final|again in 1993]], defeating the [[St. George Dragons]] in both years.<ref name="fabulous"/> 

In [[Brisbane Broncos 1995|1995]], the Super League War broke out.  After threats of expulsion from the NSWRL, the Broncos were one of the first clubs to sign with the new league and all players followed suit. Broncos CEO [[John Ribot]] moved to take over the running of the rebel [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]], leading to a perception that the conflict was orchestrated by the club.<ref name="broncshistory">{{cite book | author=Whiticker, Alan & Collis, Ian | title= The History of Rugby League Clubs

[[Brisbane Broncos 1999|1999]] was disappointing for the club with terrible early-season form hindering their attempt at a third consecutive premiership. Club legend [[Allan Langer]] retired mid-season, perhaps as a result of the team's form. Despite the club's mid-season turnaround, which resulted in qualification for the finals after an 11-match winning streak, the team was eliminated by the [[Cronulla Sharks]] in the first week of the finals.  However, the Broncos' rebounded in 2000 with their fifth premiership, defeating the [[Sydney Roosters]]. This was the last [[Brisbane Broncos 2000#2000 Grand Final|NRL Grand Final]] played in daylight hours and a game which saw the retirement of veterans [[Kevin Walters]] and [[Michael Hancock (rugby league footballer)|Michael Hancock]].<ref name="fabulous"/>

Allan Langer returned to the club in [[Brisbane Broncos 2002|2002]] for one season before eventually retiring. 2002 was also the beginning of Brisbane's "post-Origin slump", which has haunted the club in the years since. Many players represent the [[Queensland Maroons]] in the State of Origin series and the extra workload has caused a loss of form for the club immediately after the series. The Broncos average about 7 players out for every Origin game.<ref>{{cite web | title=Brisbane Broncos - Representative Players|url=http://www.broncos.com.au/index.cfm?MenuID=330&TopMenuID=266| accessdate=2007-04-21}} </ref> This was evidenced in 2003 when the ladder-leading Broncos lost 10 of their last 11 games.  Despite faring better in [[Brisbane Broncos 2004|2004]] and [[Brisbane Broncos 2005|2005]], the team still struggled in the latter stages of the season, losing all of their finals matches.<ref name="fabulous"/>

In [[Brisbane Broncos 2006|2006]], after a strong early and mid-season performance, the Broncos again entered the post-Origin slump, losing 5 consecutive games. However, they reversed this run of form, winning 6 of their last 7 games including the premiership decider against the [[Melbourne Storm]] and keeping their perfect Grand Final record intact.<ref name="fabulous">{{cite book | author=Pramberg, Bernie and Malone, Paul and Colman, Mike and Dick, Barry| title= Broncos: 20 Fabulous Years | publisher=Playright Publishing Pty Ltd | year=2007| id=ISBN 0-9775226-4-4}}</ref>

==Emblem==
[[Image:brisbane 1988.jpg|thumb|150px|The club's original logo, used from 1988 to 1999.]]
It had originally been planned for the Brisbane Broncos to adopt a logo incorporating both a [[kangaroo]] and a stylised "Q" which had been featured in the logo for the Queensland Rugby League for many years. However, with the [[Australian national rugby league team]] also known as the Kangaroos, this was deemed inappropriate and conflicting. The [[Cooktown Orchid]] which had long been used by Brisbane clubs in the [[Bulimba Cup (rugby league competition)|Bulimba Cup]] was also ruled out, along with other [[Fauna of Australia|Australian animals]] such as the [[brumby]], [[possum]], [[galah]] and the [[kookaburra]], which was used on Brisbane's Kookaburra Queen [[Paddle steamer|paddleships]].<ref name="broncsteamtobeat">{{cite book | author=Gallaway, Jack | title=The Brisbane Broncos: The Team To Beat | publisher=University of Queensland Press | year=2001 | id=ISBN 0-7022-3275-0}}</ref> Having wanted to continue with the use of [[alliteration]] for local sporting teams such as the [[Brisbane Bullets]] and [[Brisbane Bears]], the club's directors eventually decided on the nickname [[Bronco]]s.<ref name="broncshistory">{{cite book | author=Whiticker, Alan & Collis, Ian | title= The History of Rugby League Clubs | publisher=New Holland Publishers (Australia) Pty Ltd | year=2004 | id=ISBN 1-74110-075-5}}</ref>

The original club logo was first featured in the Broncos' inaugural season in the premiership in 1988 and was used until 1999. It used a mostly [[gold]] colour scheme, in line with the predominant colour on the team jerseys. In 2000, the club adopted a new logo with a more [[Maroon (color)|maroon]] design, which was much closer to the traditional colour associated with Queensland rugby league and Queensland sport in general.<ref name="fabulous"/> This design continues to be used to date.

==Colours==
{{leagueicon|Brisbane|100|align=left}}Traditionally, the colours of the Brisbane Broncos have been maroon, white and gold, which have all long been linked to the history of rugby league in Queensland. Initially, the founders of the club favoured the official blue and gold colours of [[Brisbane City Council]]. However, Sydney advertiser [[John Singleton]] advised the board that "Queenslanders had been booing players wearing blue for more than three-quarters of a century."<ref name="broncsteamtobeat">{{cite book | author=Gallaway, Jack   | title=The Brisbane Broncos: The Team To Beat   | publisher=University of Queensland Press   | year=2002  | id=ISBN 0-7022-3275-0}}</ref> As a result, the traditional maroon and white colours of Brisbane Bullimba Cup sides along with gold, symbolising the Queensland sunshine,<ref name="broncsteamtobeat">{{cite book | author=Gallaway, Jack   | title=The Brisbane Broncos: The Team To Beat   | publisher=University of Queensland Press   | year=2002  | id=ISBN 0-7022-3275-0}}</ref> were adopted as the club's colours.

In the inaugural 1988 season, the club's jersey design featured the top third being gold, the middle being alternating hoops of maroon and white and the bottom third being maroon. Although this design featured gold strongly, it did not please everyone as the jersey had to differentiate from the maroon and white of [[Manly Sea Eagles|Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]] and the maroon of the [[Queensland State of Origin team]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Rugby League History - RL1908.com - Brisbane Broncos | url=http://www.rl1908.com/Clubs/Brisbane-Broncos.htm | accessdate=2007-04-27}}</ref> Following a number of design changes in the 1990s including a predominantly white jersey from 1997 to 1998, blue was added to the jersey in 2001 as a minor colour to show the aforementioned historical link with the colours of Brisbane. However, this was later dropped from the design in favour of a mainly maroon jersey with gold trim.<ref name="fabulous"/>

At the 1995 [[Rugby League World Sevens]] tournament, the club introduced a new combination of jersey colours - mauve, aqua and white. Brisbane Broncos Marketing Manager Shane Edwards stated that it "will become our Sevens strip... but we will never change the Broncos' colours."<ref> Bronco! Magazine Issue 1, 1995 </ref> In 2001, following the release of the club's predominantly navy-blue and maroon away jersey, the National Rugby League ordered the club to produce a third jersey since the new away jersey clashed with the home jerseys of the [[Penrith Panthers]], Melbourne Storm and [[New Zealand Warriors]]. An aqua strip using the same design as the jerseys used from 1999 to 2001 was worn, which was much derided by the local media. Following two years of public pressure the club dropped the jersey in favour of the design worn against Newcastle at 2003 (the first match at the refurbished Suncorp Stadium).<ref name="fabulous"/>

==Stadium==
{{Main|Brisbane Broncos Stadiums}}
[[Image:Last broncos game at anz.jpg|thumb|250px|The Brisbane Broncos, at the then-ANZ Stadium (1993-2003).]]
In their first five seasons, the Broncos played their matches at [[Lang Park]], the ground considered to be the home of rugby league in Queensland. However, following ongoing conflict with the Queensland Rugby League and Lang Park Trust, the team relocated to [[Queensland Sport and Athletics Centre|ANZ Stadium]] in 1993.<ref name="broncs1908">{{cite web | title=Brisbane Broncos History RL1908 |url=http://www.rl1908.com/Clubs/Brisbane-Broncos.htm | accessdate=2007-04-06}}</ref> The club's home match attendance, which had averaged 19,637 at Lang Park, increased to 43,200 at the new ground in the first season following the club's premiership title in the previous season.<ref name="broncscrowd">{{cite web | title=Rugby League Tables / Attendances Brisbane |url=http://stats.rleague.com/rl/crowds/brisbane.html | accessdate=2007-04-06}}</ref> However, despite the team's second premiership in 1993, crowds gradually declined, with the club failing, until 2002, to register more than the 1996 average of 23,712.

[[Image:Suncorp Stadium.jpg|thumb|250px|left|View of the current Brisbane Broncos home ground, Suncorp Stadium.]]
With the Queensland Government's $280,000,000 redevelopment of Lang Park,<ref>{{cite web | title=Suncopr Stadium Land Park Redevelopment |url=http://www.arup.com/australasia/project.cfm?pageid=1354 | accessdate=2007-04-22}}</ref> the team moved back to the refurbished and renamed Suncorp Stadium upon its completion in mid-2003. The more centrally-located stadium has begun to attract increasingly higher crowds, with the 2006 average attendance of 31,208 being significantly higher than the [[Newcastle Knights]] with 21,848 and about double the regular season competition average of 15,601.<ref name="broncscrowd">{{cite web | title=Rugby League Tables / Attendances Brisbane |url=http://stats.rleague.com/rl/crowds/brisbane.html | accessdate=2007-04-06}}</ref>

The club record attendance for a regular season match is 58,593, set against the St. George Dragons in the final round of the 1993 season. The record attendance for a match at Suncorp Stadium is 50,416, set in the opening round of the 2007 season against the [[North Queensland Cowboys]].<ref name="broncscrowd">{{cite web | title=Rugby League Tables / Attendances Brisbane |url=http://stats.rleague.com/rl/crowds/brisbane.html | accessdate=2007-04-06}}</ref>

==Statistics and records==

==Notable players==
:''For a full list of Broncos representatives, see [[Brisbane Broncos Representatives]]''
The representative playing list of the Brisbane Broncos has traditionally been extensive due to the club's premiership success and being the dominant Queensland team in the competition for the majority of its participation. Consequently, there have been a large number of Queensland Maroons in the team. In 2007, a 20 man legends team was announced to celebrate the club's 20 year anniversary.<ref> {{citeweb | title=Broncos Name Legends Team | url=http://www.nrl.com/News/Latest/NewsArticle/tabid/76/NewsId/5007/Default.aspx | accessdate=2007-05-09 }}</ref>
