'''Jay Pritzker Pavilion''', '''Pritzker Pavilion''', or '''Pritzker Music Pavilion''' is a [[band shell]] in the [[Chicago Loop|Loop]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]] of [[Chicago]] in [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], [[Illinois]], [[United States]]. The [[Frank Gehry]]-designed pavilion, named for [[Pritzker family]] member [[Jay Pritzker]], was constructed between June 1999 and July 2004 in [[Millennium Park]].<ref name=MPF&F/> It is located on the south side of [[Randolph Street (Chicago)|Randolph Street]] directly across from some of the [[List of tallest buildings in the world|tallest buildings in the world]] and east of the [[Chicago Landmark]] [[Historic Michigan Boulevard District]].

It is the park's outdoor performing arts venue and the new home of the [[Grant Park Symphony Orchestra and Chorus]]. As home of the Grant Park Symphony Orchestra and Chorus it is also the home of the [[Grant Park Music Festival]], the nation's only remaining free outdoor [[classical music]] series. The structure is built partially atop the [[Harris Theater (Chicago)|Harris Theater for Music and Dance]], the park's indoor performing arts venue.<ref name=PBKT>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbase.com/tanakak/pritzker|title=The Jay Pritzker Pavilion|accessdate=2007-09-20|publisher=Pbase.com and Kenneth Tanaka}}</ref> It serves as the centerpiece for the park that was opened on [[July 16]] [[2004]].<ref name=JPMPSaGaiL>{{cite web|url=http://www.lares-lexicon.com/millenium/millenium.html|accessdate=2007-09-20|title=The Jay Pritzker Music Pavilion Sounds as Good as it Looks|author=Delacoma, Wayne}}</ref>.

The performance venue is designed with a large fixed seating area, a great lawn, a [[trellis]] network to support the [[sound system]] and a signature Gehry [[stainless steel]] [[headdress]]. It features a sound system with an innovative acoustic design that replicates an indoor [[concert hall]] sound experience.  The pavilion and the park in general are well-known and respected for their [[accessibility]].<ref name=PVA>{{cite web|url=http://pva.convio.net/site/DocServer/PN_BFA_2005_Article.pdf?docID=1921|title=Chicago's New Class Act|accessdate=2007-12-21|year=2005|month=July|publisher=Paralyzed Veterans of America|work=PN|author=Deyer, Joshua}}</ref>

==Design and development==

The pavilion includes 4,000 fixed seats and {{Ft2 to m2|95000}} great lawn that accommodates an additional audience of 7,000.<ref name=MPF&F/> The pavilion features a {{ft to m|120}} [[proscenium]] [[theatre (structure)|theatre]] with a brushed stainless steel headdress. The main stage, which can accommodate a full orchestra and chorus of 150 members,<ref name=PPT/> is connected by this frame to a [[trellis]] of interlocking crisscrossing steel pipes that support the [[sound system]]. The innovative sound system distributes sound to mimic indoor [[concert hall]] [[acoustics]].<ref name=MPJPP>{{cite web|url=http://www.millenniumpark.org/artandarchitecture/jay_pritzker_pavilion.html|accessdate=2007-09-20|title=Jay Pritzker Pavilion|publisher=City of Chicago}}</ref> The trellis is {{ft to m|600|300}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archrecord.construction.com/projects/BTS/archives/perform/05_jayPritzker/overview.asp|accessdate=2007-09-20|title=Jay Pritzker Pavilion |publisher=The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.|work=Architectural Record|author=Kamin, Blair}}</ref> The cost of the project was [[United States dollar|$]]60 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/September-2007/Ten-Modern-Masterpieces/The-List/index.php?cp=3&si=2|accessdate=2007-09-20|title=The List|publisher=Chicago Magazine}}</ref> The structure is named after [[Jay Pritzker]], a prominent Chicago businessman from the [[Pritzker family]], who own the [[Hyatt Hotels]].<ref name=AI>{{cite web|url=http://gochicago.about.com/od/attractionsandlandmarks/ss/millennium_park_3.htm|accessdate=2007-09-20|title=Jay Pritzker Pavilion|publisher=About, Inc.|author=Carlson, Prescott}}</ref> The family contributed $15 million to the construction.<ref name=PPT>{{cite web|url=http://chicagoarchitecture.info/Building/1248/Pritzker_Pavilion__The.php|accessdate=2007-09-20|publisher=chicagoarchitecture.info|title=Pritzker Pavilion, The}}</ref>

The development follows a series of open-air projects by [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao]] designer, Frank Gehry, such as the [[Merriweather Post Pavilion]] in [[Columbia, Maryland]], the [[Concord Performing Arts Center]] in [[Concord, California]], and numerous renovations to the [[Hollywood Bowl]] in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood, California]]. The structure is also a part of a larger inner city redevelopment that includes a theater, extensive gardens and a Gehry-designed serpentine pedestrian [[footbridge]] that buffers against street noise.<ref name=gug/> The redevelopment was part of an effort to overcome unsightly [[railroad track]]s and [[parking lot]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citymayors.com/environment/millennium_park.html|accessdate=2007-09-20|publisher=citymayors.com|author=Pesci, Renato|title=A people's park of international importance in downtown Chicago}}</ref> Much like his [[Experience Music Project]] in [[Seattle, Washington]], it suggests musical qualities. The trellis design was an effort to avoid the traditional obstructing forest of speaker towers.<ref name=gug>{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/exhibitions/past_exhibitions/gehry/millenium_30.html|accessdate=2007-09-20|title=Millennium Park Music Pavilion and Great Lawn|publisher=guggenheim.org}}</ref>

[[Image:2005-10-13 2880x1920 chicago above millennium park.jpg|thumb|Pavilion from the north]]
The original design was much more modest. It had a smaller shell structure and speakers affixed to poles interspersed throughout the seating area. However, two things happened to change the original plans. [[John H. Bryan]], former [[CEO]] of the [[Sara Lee Corporation]], raised revenues to change the scope of the project. Also, Jay Pritzker's widow, Cindy, was unimpressed with the design and demanded that Gehry be involved.<ref name=JPMPSaGaiL/> Despite the redesign, the pavilion has its blemishes: the supporting backside along Randolph Street is controversial, and the fact that the supporting proscenium braces are left exposed is offensive to some observers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lynnbecker.com/repeat/Gehry/gehrybaroque.htm|accessdate=2007-09-21|title=Frank Gehry, Millennium Park and the development of the Techno-Baroque|author=Becker, Lynn|publisher=Lynn Becker |work=Repeat}}</ref>

The Millennium Park director has been honored for his contribution to making America more accessible.  The stage is accessible by gently-sloped ramps instead of stairs as part of the overall parks accessibility aware design.<ref name=PVA/>

===Acoustics===
[[Image:20070919 Pritzker Pavilion bandshell.JPG|thumb|180px|right|The pavilion [[band shell]] is designed to reflect sound for optimal acoustics.]]
Pritzker uses an innovative [[LARES]] sound system that generates reflected and reverberant energy that surrounds the audience. The system causes the sound quality to be fairly uniform throughout the entire venue. The system has received critical acclaim for adaptations of its technologies such as signal processing in a variety of indoor and outdoor venues.<ref name=JPMPSaGaiL/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mixfoundation.org/tec/1993.html|title=1993 TEC Awards|publisher=mixfoundation.org}}</ref> The Pritzker Pavilion is the first permanent outdoor installation of the LARES system in the United States. The trellis serves acoustic and architectural purposes because it allows for the precise placement for sound optimization without visual obstructions, and it simultaneously provides a unifying visual canopy.<ref name=JPMPSaGaiL/>  

[[Image:20070919 Pritzker Pavilion speakers.JPG|thumb|left|Speakers close up]]
The overall acoustic system is described as a distributed sound reinforcement system. It uses many innovative features as well as standard sound reinforcement techniques.  With this system musicians on stage are able to hear each other clearly in a way that facilitates ensemble play.  In addition, direct natural sound from the stage is reflected from architectural surfaces as well as being reinforced by two sound systems.  The forward facing reinforcement speakers time the relaying of sound so as to make it seem to have arrived directly from the stage with clarity and proper volume levels. Distributed speakers allow for lower sound volumes than would be necessary with centralized speakers that would disturb the neighboring residences and business.<ref name=JPP,MP>{{cite web|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/strategies/noise/docs/urbandes/16pritzkerpavillion.pdf|accessdate=2007-09-21|title=Jay Pritzker Pavilion, Millennium Park|publisher=Talaske|work=london.gov.uk}}</ref><ref name=JPMPSaGaiL/>

Specifically, the trellis system has unique features. Instead of merely reinforcing the sound like a traditional public address system, it seeks to replicate the acoustics of a concert hall, and it creates a clearly defined concert space. Sound arriving directly from lateral sources masks city disturbances. Downward facing acoustic enhancement speakers simulate sound reflection similar to indoor concert hall wall and ceiling effects.<ref name=JPP,MP/><ref name=JPMPSaGaiL/>

The initial plan was that the lawn seating would be free for all events.  In fact, an early brochure for the Grant Park Music Festival said "You never need a ticket to attend a concert! The lawn and the general seating section are always admission free."<ref name=HocfMPc/>  However, parking revenue fell short of estimates during the first year and at the [[August 31]][[2005]] concert by Tori Amos the city charged $10 for lawn seating.  However, because the Pavilion is an open air venue, the city contends that there were many places in Millennium Park, such as [[The Cloud Gate]], [[Crown Fountain]] and [[Lurie Gardens]], from which one could have enjoyed the sounds or the atmosphere of the park.<ref name=HocfMPc/><ref name=CCTPVIPP/>  In a related controversy of this concert, the Gehry-designed [[BP Pedestrian Bridge]] that connects Millenium Park with [[Daley Bicentennial Plaza]] was closed until 7:00 A.M. the next day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=116266DCE2E9D5F0&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=A bad deal all around|accessdate=2008-05-18|date=[[2005-09-09]]|publisher=Newsbank|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|author=Wasielewski, Carl}}</ref>  Amos earned positive reviews as the venues inaugural [[Rock and roll]] performer, because she is a classically trained musician who chose only [[piano]] and [[Organ (music)|organ]] accompaniment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=10CF366622FB2B70&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=Amos creates musical magic as Pritzker's first rock act|accessdate=2008-05-18|date=[[2005-09-02]]|publisher=Newsbank|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|author=Orloff, Brian}}</ref><ref name=CoTharihoc/>  In addition to charging for lawn seating, the event promoters prohibited its customers from bringing any beverage (even bottled water) to the lawn but allowed the purchase of beverages at events.<ref name=CCTPVIPP/>  The city contended that confiscation of unopened beverage bottles was a mistake and that "Bottled water is always allowed at the free concerts we host at the park, and will be allowed at any future events as well."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=10D5CE1E91AA8D70&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=Bottled water hardly worth all the fuss we make of it|accessdate=2008-05-18|date=[[2005-09-21]]|publisher=Newsbank|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|author=[[Richard Roeper|Roeper, Richard]]}}</ref>  An estimated 300 attendees set up their blankets beyond the bounds of the trellis system to enjoy their own beverage.<ref name=CoTharihoc>{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=10C60A7D8F809508&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title= Church of Tori holds a revival in heart of city|accessdate=2008-05-18|date=[[2005-09-02]]|publisher=Newsbank|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|author=Elder, Robert K.}}</ref>
