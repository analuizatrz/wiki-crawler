{{nihongo|'''''Final Fantasy III'''''|ファイナルファンタジーIII|Fainaru Fantajī Surī}} is a [[console role-playing game]] developed and published by [[Square Co.|Square]] in {{vgy|1990}} for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] as the third installment in the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series. It is the first numbered ''Final Fantasy'' game to feature the job-change system.

The story revolves around four orphaned youths drawn to a crystal of light. The crystal grants them some of its power, and instructs them to go forth and restore balance to the world. Not knowing what to make of the crystal's pronouncements, but nonetheless recognizing the importance of its words, the four inform their adoptive families of their mission and set out to explore and bring back balance to the world.

The game was released in Japan on [[April 27]], [[1990]]. It had never been released outside of Japan until an enhanced remake was released on the [[Nintendo DS]] on [[August 24]], [[2006]]. At the time, this made it the only ''Final Fantasy'' game not released in North America or Europe.<ref>{{cite web | author=Gantayat, Anoop |date = 2004-10-07| title=Miyamoto Speaks to Final Fantasy Producer| publisher=[[IGN]] | url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/555/555485p1.html | accessdate=2006-09-03}}</ref> There had been earlier plans to remake the game for [[Bandai]]'s [[WonderSwan Color]] handheld, as had been done with the first, second, and fourth installments of the series, but the game faced several delays and was eventually canceled after the premature cancelation of the platform. The Nintendo DS version of the game was positively received internationally, selling over one million copies in Japan.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Final Fantasy III JAP Menu.png|thumb|left|Main menu screen]]

The gameplay of ''Final Fantasy III'' combines elements of the first two ''Final Fantasy'' games with new features. The [[Turn-based strategy|turn-based]] combat system remains in place from the first two games, but [[Health (game mechanism)|hit point]]s are now shown above the target following attacks or healing actions, rather than captioned as in the previous two games. Auto-targeting for physical attacks after a friendly or enemy unit is killed is also featured for the first time. Unlike subsequent games in the series, however, magical attacks are not auto-targeted in the same fashion.<ref name="manual">{{cite book|title=Final Fantasty III instruction manual|date=1990|author=Square Enix}}</ref>

The [[experience point]] system featured in ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]'' makes a return following its absence from ''[[Final Fantasy II]]''. The [[Final Fantasy character classes|character class]] system featured in the first game in the franchise also reappears, with some modifications. Whereas in the original game the player chooses each character's class alignment at the start of the game, ''Final Fantasy III'' introduces the "job system" for which the series would later become famous. Jobs are presented as interchangeable classes: in the Famicom version of the game, all four characters begin as "Onion Knights", with a variety of additional jobs becoming available as the game progresses. Any playable character has access to every currently available job.<ref name="ugo">{{cite web | title = Final Fantasy III | work = The World of Final Fantasy | publisher = [[UGO Networks|UGO.com]] Games | author = Roschin, Oleg;  Vitaglione, Erik | url = http://www.ugo.com/channels/games/features/finalfantasy/finalfantasy3.asp | accessdate = 2008-07-11 }}</ref> Switching jobs consumes "capacity points" which are awarded to the entire party following every battle, much like [[Common_elements_of_Final_Fantasy#Currency|gil]]. Different [[Common_elements_of_Final_Fantasy#Weapons|weapons]], [[Common_elements_of_Final_Fantasy#Armor_and_accessories|armor and accessories]], and [[Final Fantasy magic|magic spells]] are utilized by each job. A character's level of proficiency at a particular job increases the longer the character remains with that job. Higher job levels increase the battle statistics of the character and reduce the cost in capacity points to switch to that job.<ref name=manual />

''Final Fantasy III'' is the first game in the series to feature special battle commands such as "Steal" or "Jump", each of which is associated with a particular job ("Steal" is the Thief's specialty, while "Jump" is the Dragoon's forte). Certain jobs also feature innate, non-battle abilities, such as the Thief's ability to open passages that would otherwise require a special key item.<ref>{{cite web | title = Final Fantasy III Cheats | work = [[GameSpy]] | url = http://cheats.gamespy.com/nes-cheats/final-fantasy-iii/ | accessdate = 2008-07-11 }}</ref> It is also the first game in the series to feature [[Final Fantasy character classes#Summoner|summoned creatures]] which are called with the "Summon" skill.<ref name="ugo" />[[Image:Ff3dsbattle.jpg|left|thumb|Combat and the job system were significantly changed for this release.]]

===Nintendo DS version===
''Final Fantasy III'' for the Nintendo DS features overhauls to the job system, including the rebalancing of the classes, the addition of new abilities, a new "Freelancer" class that replaces "Onion Knight" as the default job at the beginning of the game (Onion Knight is retained as a secret class), new events, a new crystal and dungeon, and the removal of capacity points. Unlike the original Famicom version, most of the jobs remain useful for the entire game. The ultimate jobs – the Ninja and the Sage – and some of the lesser-used jobs like the Geomancer were redesigned to have the same level of abilities as the Warrior.<ref name="strat">{{cite book|title=Final Fantasy III Official Strategy Guide|publisher=Brady Games|date=[[2006-11-15]]|isbn=0744008484}}</ref>

In place of capacity points, each character incurs a small penalty for switching jobs. This penalty decreases the character's statistics for the next 0 to 10 battles. This period is called a "Job Transition Phase" and its length is based on "job compatibility" and the difference in job levels between the new job and old job.<ref name=strat />

The remake takes advantage of the Wi-Fi feature of the Nintendo DS in the form of a Mail/Mognet system similar to ''[[Final Fantasy IX]]''. Various [[Common_elements_of_Final_Fantasy#Moogle|moogles]] in the game allow the player to send mail to others. Players are also able to send mail to various characters in the game as well as to other players.<ref name = "iiinstructions"/> Side quests can also be unlocked using this system, such as the quest to unlock the Onion Knight.<ref>{{cite web | author= Shoemaker, Brad |date = [[2006-07-20]]| title=Final Fantasy III Update| work=Gamespot.com | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ds/rpg/finalfantasyiii/news.html?sid=6154385 | accessdate=August 31 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref> A quick save option is also available, similar to other 2D ''Final Fantasy'' remakes, except for ''[[Final Fantasy I & II: Dawn of Souls]]''.  However, like in the original, there are no save points in the game's dungeons.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-07-16|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=163246|title=Final Fantasy III |publisher=Computer and Video Games }}</ref>

===Setting===
One thousand years before the events in the game, on a floating continent hovering high above the surface of an unnamed planet, a technologically advanced civilization sought to harness the power of the four [[classical element|elemental]] crystals of light. They did not realize that they could not control such fundamental forces of nature. This power of light would have consumed the world itself had the light crystals not had their natural counterparts: the four dark elemental crystals. Disturbed by the sudden interruption of the careful balance of light and dark, four warriors were granted the power of the dark crystals to recapture the power of the light crystals. These so-called Dark Warriors succeeded in their quest, and restored harmony to the world. But their victory came too late to save the doomed civilization. Their culture was reduced to ruin, though their floating continent remained. On that continent, the circle of Gulgans, a race of blind [[Haruspex|soothsayers]] and fortune-tellers, predicted that these events will ultimately repeat.<ref name=game>{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy III|developer=Square|publisher=Square|date=[[1990-04-27]]|platform=Nintendo Family Computer|isolang=ja}}</ref>

===Characters===
[[Image:FinalfantasyIIIhero.jpg|thumb|Development sketch by [[Yoshitaka Amano]] of an unnamed hero riding a dragon]]

''Final Fantasy III'' focuses around four orphans from the remote village of Ur. The remake of the game for the Nintendo DS features a new set of party members designed by [[Akihiko Yoshida]], each with new backstories and personalities: {{nihongo|Luneth|ルーネス|Rūnesu}}, an orphan raised in the village of Ur who is curious and adventurous by nature; {{nihongo|Refia|レフィア}}, who tires of her father's blacksmith training and often runs away from home; {{nihongo|Arc|アルクゥ|Arukū}}, who is Luneth's childhood best friend and a timid yet intelligent young man; and {{nihongo|Ingus|イングズ|Inguzu}}, who is a loyal soldier serving the King of Sasune, who is trying to save the missing Lady Sara.<ref name="iiinstructions">{{cite book | year=2006 | editor=Square Enix | title=Final Fantasy III Instruction Book | pages=51 | publisher=Square Enix | language=English | id=}}</ref>

===Story===
An earthquake opens up a previously hidden cavern in Altar Cave near the village of Ur on the floating continent. Four young orphans under the care of Topapa, the village elder, explore the earthquake's impact and come across a crystal of light. The crystal grants them a portion of its power, and instructs them to go forth and restore balance to the world. Not knowing what to make of the crystal's pronouncements, but nonetheless recognizing the importance of its words, the four inform their adoptive family of their mission and set out to explore an [[overworld]] outside the area in which they were brought up to bring back balance to the world.<ref name=game />

Their adventures bring them to discover that there lies a whole world beyond the boundaries of the floating continent upon which they were living. In the world below, they discover that a demon named Xande, one of three apprentices to the legendary Archmage Noah, is trying to possess the crystals of light to bring forth chaos and disorder. The four warriors eventually arrive at the Crystal Tower where they discover that the Cloud of Darkness is the source of the recent events. It is attempting to bring back a similar situation as the Flood of Light a thousand years earlier so that the world is pulled into the void. The warriors from the light traverse into the domain of the dark crystals to free the imprisoned dark warriors and defeat the Cloud of Darkness, therefore restoring the crystals and balance to the world.<ref name=game />

==Development==
Director [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], designer [[Hiromichi Tanaka]], character designer [[Yoshitaka Amano]], scenario writer [[Kenji Terada]], and music composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]] returned from the two previous ''Final Fantasy'' games to contribute to the development of ''Final Fantasy III''.<ref>{{cite web | title = Game Credits for Final Fantasy III | work = [http://www.mobygames.com/ MobyGames] | url = http://www.mobygames.com/game/nes/final-fantasy-iii/credits | accessdate = 2008-07-14}}</ref> As with the previous two installments of the series, ''Final Fantasy III'' was programmed for the Famicom by [[Nasir Gebelli]].

Square developed and released ''Final Fantasy III'' during the same period that Nintendo released its 16-bit [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] console, intended as the successor to the original 8-bit Famicom. Designer Hiromichi Tanaka said that the original game was never released outside of Japan because Square was focused on developing for Nintendo's new console.

{{Quote|Nowadays we know that when you've got a platform like PlayStation, you'll have PlayStation 2 and then PlayStation 3, and where you've got Xbox, you move on to Xbox 360 - you can sort of assume what's going to happen in the future. But back then, that was the first time that we'd seen a new generation of consoles, and it was really difficult to predict what was going to happen. At that time, then, we were working so hard to catch up on the new technology that we didn't have enough manpower to work on an English version of ''Final Fantasy III''|Hiromichi Tanaka<ref name="euro" />}}[[Image:FF3 WonderSwanColor.jpg|thumb|left|Development screenshot from the unfinished WonderSwan Color remake]]

In 2007, Hiromichi Tanaka explained in an interview that the WonderSwan Color remake had been abandoned because the size and structure of the coding of the original Famicom game was too difficult to recreate on the WonderSwan Color:<ref>{{cite web |author=Hartley, Adam |title=SPOnG Interview: Square Enix's Senior VP Hiromichi Tanaka |url=http://spong.com/feature/10109508 |publisher=SPOnG |date=2007-02-01 |accessdate=2007-02-12}}</ref>

{{quote|When we developed FF3, the volume of content in the game was so huge that the cartridge was completely full, and when new platforms emerged, there simply wasn't enough storage space available for an update of FF3, because that would have required new graphics, music and other content.

Following the failure of the effort to remake the game for the WonderSwan Color, and Square's merger with former competitor [[Enix]] to form Square Enix in {{vgy|2003}}, the company posted assurance that the game's promised remake would not be completely forgotten, and there was speculation that it might find its way to [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]]'s [[PlayStation]] or Nintendo's [[Game Boy Advance]] as its predecessors had.<ref name="Remake">{{cite web | author=Andrew Long and Jesse Kanda | date=2003 | title=Final Fantasy III Finally On Deck | url=http://www.rpgamer.com/news/Q3-2003/070703a.html | publisher=[[RPGamer]] | accessdate=2006-09-04}}</ref><ref name="GBA">{{cite web | author=Adam Riley |date=2006-08-05| title=Final Fantasy III: Nintendo DS | url=http://www.cubed3.com/preview/194/ | publisher=Cubed3.com | accessdate=2006-09-04}}</ref> Square Enix considered porting the game to the [[PlayStation 2]], but was eventually convinced by Nintendo to develop the title for their new handheld system, the Nintendo DS, a decision that would later be positively reinforced by the commercial success of the [[Nintendo DS]].<ref>{{cite web | title=TGS 2006: Square on Final Fantasy III|date=2006-09-24| url= http://ds.ign.com/articles/734/734997p1.html |author=Nix| publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=2006-09-25}}</ref> The ''Final Fantasy III'' remake was first announced to be in development on [[2004-10-07]], but detailed information did not emerge until a year later. Hiromichi Tanaka headed the project as both the executive producer and director. His guidance and supervision were needed because the remake was not a mere graphical update as ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy II]]''{{'}}s remakes were, but a total overhaul using the Nintendo DS's [[3D computer graphics|3D]] capabilities. Along with 3D graphics, a [[full motion video]] opening scene was produced for the game, similar to those found in the ports of the 2D ''Final Fantasy'' games for the PlayStation. Developer Matrix Software handled the programming of the game.<ref>{{cite web | title="Creator's Voice" - The Final Fantasy III Interview |date=2006-08-10 | url=http://xcomp.gamebrink.com/?p=222 | publisher=zgameBrink.com | accessdate=2006-08-27}}</ref>

The remake was produced by Tomoya Asano and co-developed by Matrix Software and Square Enix.  In addition, Ryosuke Aiba (''[[Final Fantasy XI]]'') was the [[art director]]. [[Akihiko Yoshida]] (''[[Final Fantasy XII]]'') redesigned the original characters for use in 3D, and designed the looks of the [[List of Final Fantasy III characters|new playable characters]].<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-07-16|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/nintendo-ds/final-fantasy-iii_|title=Final Fantasy III |publisher=Moby Games }}</ref> The formerly generic and nameless party characters were replaced with more concrete charaters with new personalities and background stories, and additional scenes were added to develop their individuality; however, the main storyline was not altered significantly.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-07-16|url=http://palgn.com.au/article.php?id=6546|title=Final Fantasy III Review |publisher=PALGN }}</ref> Along with these four, additional characters (called "sub-characters") also join the party temporarily, like in the original.
