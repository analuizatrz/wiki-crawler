A '''trade route''' is a [[Logistics|logistical network]] identified as a series of pathways and stoppages used for the commercial transport of cargo. Allowing [[Good (economics and accounting)|good]]s to reach distant [[market]]s, a single trade route contains long distance [[Arterial road|arteries]] which may further be connected to several smaller networks of commercial and non commercial transportation.<ref name=Ciolek>{{cite web| last = Ciolek| first = T.

Historically, the period from 1500 BCE&ndash;1 CE saw the Western Asian, [[Mediterranean]], [[China|Chinese]] and [[India]]n societies develop major transportation networks for trade.<ref name=Denemark1>Denemark 2000: 274</ref> [[Europe]]'s early trading routes included the [[Amber Road]], which served as a dependable network for long distance trade.<ref name=Burns1/> [[Maritime]] trade along the [[Spice route]] became prominent during the [[middle ages]]; nations resorted to military means for control of this influential route.<ref>Donkin 2003: 169</ref> During the Middle Ages organizations such as the [[Hanseatic League]], aimed at protecting interests of the merchants and trade, also became increasingly prominent.<ref name=Dollinger2/> 

With the advent of [[modern times]], commercial activity shifted from the major trade routes of the [[Old World]] to newer routes between modern [[nation states]]. This activity was sometimes carried out without traditional protection of trade and under [[free trade|international free trade]] agreements, which allowed commercial goods to cross borders with relaxed restrictions.<ref name=Columbia2/> Innovative transportation of the modern times includes [[pipeline transport]], and the relatively well known trade using [[railways|rail routes]], [[automobiles]] and [[cargo airlines]].  

==Development of early routes==

===Early development===

The period extending from the middle of the 2nd millennium BCE to the beginning of the [[Common Era]] saw the Western Asian, Mediterranean, Chinese and Indian societies develop major transportation networks for trade.<ref name=Denemark1/>

One of the vital instruments which facilitated long distance trade was [[portage]] and the domestication of [[Working animal|beasts of burden]].<ref name=Denemark7>Denemark 2000: 207</ref> Organized caravans, visible by the 2nd millennium BCE,<ref name=Denemark8>Denemark 2000: 208</ref> could carry goods across a large distance as fodder was mostly available along the way.<ref name=Denemark7/> The domestication of [[camel]]s allowed [[Arabian]] [[nomads]] to control the long distance trade in [[spice]]s and [[silk]] from the [[Far East]] to the [[Arabian Peninsula]].<ref>Stearns 2001: 41</ref> However, caravans were useful in long-distance trade largely for carrying luxury goods, the transportation of cheaper goods across large distances was not profitable for caravan operators.<ref name=Denemark9>Denemark 2000: 213</ref> With productive developments in iron and bronze technologies, newer trade routes - dispensing innovations of civilizations - began to rise slowly.<ref name=Denemark2>Denemark 2000: 39</ref>

===Maritime trade===

{{mainarticle|Ship transport}}

Visible maritime trade between civilizations can be traced back to at least two millennia.<ref name=Denemark3/> Navigation was known in [[Sumer]] between the 4th and the 3rd millennium BCE, and was probably known by the Indians and the [[Chinese people]] before the Sumerians.<ref name=Denemark8/> The [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] had trade routes through the [[Red sea]], importing spices from the "[[Land of Punt]]" ([[East Africa]]) and from Arabia.<ref>Rawlinson 2001: 11-12</ref>

[[Image:Roadevol.svg|thumb|270px|right|Evolution of Indian logistical network. The main map shows the routes since the [[Mughal empire|Mughal times]], Inset A shows the major cultural currents of the prehistorical period, B shows pre-[[Maurya]]n Indian routes, C shows the Mauryan network, D shows the trade routes at the beginning of the [[Christian era]], and E shows the "Z" shaped region of developed roads.]]

Maritime trade began with safer coastal trade and evolved with the manipulation of the monsoon winds, soon resulting in trade crossing boundaries such as the [[Arabian Sea]] and the [[Bay of Bengal]].<ref name=Denemark3>Denemark 2000: 107</ref> [[South Asia]] had multiple maritime trade routes which connected it to [[Southeast Asia]], thereby making the control of one route resulting in maritime monopoly difficult.<ref name=Denemark3/> Indian connections to various Southeast Asian states buffered it from blockages on other routes.<ref name=Denemark3/> By making use of the maritime trade routes, [[Roman commerce#Commercial infrastructure|bulk commodity trade]] became possible for the [[Ancient Romans|Romans]] in the 2nd century BCE.<ref name=Toutain1>Toutain 1979: 243</ref> A Roman trading vessel could span the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in a month at [[Roman commerce#Sea routes|one-sixtieth the cost]] of [[Roman commerce#Land routes|over-land routes]].<ref>Scarre 1995 </ref> 

===Visible trade routes===

The peninsula of [[Anatolia]] lay on the commercial land routes to Europe from [[Asia]] as well as the sea route from the Mediterranean to the [[Black Sea]].<ref name=Streans1>Stearns 2001: 37</ref> Records from the 19th century BCE attest to the existence of an [[Assyrian]] merchant colony at [[Kanesh]] in [[Cappadocia]] (now in modern [[Turkey]]).<ref name=Streans1/>  Trading networks of the Old World included the [[Grand Trunk Road]] of [[India]] and the [[Incense Road]] of Arabia.<ref name=Denemark1/> A transportation network consisting of hard-surfaced highways, using concrete made from volcanic ash and lime, was built by the Romans as early as 312 BCE, during the times of emperor [[Appius Claudius Caecus]].<ref name=EBRome>Roman road system (Encyclopedia Britannica 2002)</ref> Parts of the Mediterranean world, [[Roman Britain]], [[Tigris-Euphrates]] river system and [[North Africa]] fell under the reach of this network at some point of their history.<ref name=EBRome/>

According to Robert Allen Denemark (2000):<ref>Denemark 2000: 124</ref>

<blockquote>
"The spread of urban trading networks, and their extension along the [[Persian Gulf]] and eastern Mediterranean, created a complex molecular structure of regional foci so that as well as the zonation of core and periphery (originally created around [[Mesopotamia]]) there was a series of interacting civilizations: Mesopotamia, Egypt, the [[Indus valley civilization|Indus Valley]]; then also [[Syria]], central Anatolia ([[Hittites]]) and the [[Aegean]] ([[Minoans]] and [[Mycenaeans]]). Beyond this was a margin which included not only [[temperate]] areas such as Europe, but the dry [[steppe]] corridor of [[central Asia]]. This was truly a world system, even though it occupied only a restricted portion of the western Old World. Whilst each civilization emphasized its ideological autonomy, all were identifiably part of a common world of interacting components." 
</blockquote>

These routes - spreading [[religion]], trade and technology - have historically been vital to the growth of urban civilization.<ref>Denemark 2000: 126</ref> The extent of development of cities, and the level of their integration into a larger world system, has often been attributed to their position in various active transport networks.<ref>Denemark 2000: 273</ref>

==Historic trade routes==

===Combined land and waterway routes===

====Incense Route====
[[Image:GDRT230.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The economy of the [[Qataban|Kingdom of Qataban]] (light blue) was based on the cultivation and trade of spices and aromatics including frankincense and myrrh. These were exported to the Mediterranean, India and [[Abyssinia]] where they were greatly prized by many cultures, using camels on routes through Arabia, and to India by sea.]]

{{main|Incense route}}
The Incense Route served as a channel for trading of Indian, Arabian and East Asian goods.<ref name=Yemen1>{{cite web| title =  Traders of the Gold and Incense Road | publisher = Message of the Republic of Yemen, Berlin| url = http://www.botschaft-jemen.de/Geschichte.htm| format = HTML }}</ref> The incense trade flourished from South Arabia to the Mediterranean between roughly the 3rd century BCE to the 2nd century CE.<ref name=UNESCO1>{{cite web| title = Incense Route - Desert Cities in the Negev| publisher = UNESCO| url = http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1107| format = HTML }}</ref> This trade was crucial to the economy of [[Yemen]] and the [[frankincense]] and [[myrrh]] trees were seen as a source of wealth by the its rulers.<ref>Glasse 2001: 59</ref>

[[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]], emperor of [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], may have forged an alliance with the [[Lihyan]]ites in order to secure the incense route at [[Al-`Ula|Dedan]], thereby rerouting the incense trade from Dedan to the coast along the Red Sea to Egypt.<ref>Kitchen 1994: 46</ref> [[I. E. S. Edwards]] connects the [[Syro-Ephraimite War]] to the desire of the [[Israelites]] and the [[Aramaeans]] to control the northern end of the Incense route, which ran up from Southern Arabia and could be tapped by commanding [[Transjordan]].<ref>Edwards 1969: 329</ref> 

[[Gerrha]] - inhabited by [[Chaldean]] exiles from [[Babylon]] - controlled the Incense trade routes across Arabia to the Mediterranean and exercised control over the trading of [[aromatics]] to Babylon in the 1st century BC.<ref>Larsen 1983: 56</ref> The [[Nabateans]] exercised control over the routes along the Incense Route, and their hold was challenged - without success - by [[Antigonus Cyclops]], emperor of Syria and [[Palestine]].<ref name=Eckenstein1>Eckenstein 2005: 86</ref> The Nabatean control over trade further increased and spread in many directions.<ref name=Eckenstein1/>

The replacement of [[Greece]] by the [[Roman empire]] as the administrator of the Mediterranean basin led to the resumption of direct trade with the East and the elimination of the taxes extracted previously by the middlemen of the south.<ref name=Lach1>Lach 1994: 13</ref> According to Milo Kearney (2003) "The South Arabs in protest took to pirate attacks over the Roman ships in the [[Gulf of Aden]]. In response, the Romans destroyed Aden and favored the Western [[Abyssinia]]n coast of the Red Sea."<ref>Kearney 2003: 42</ref> Indian ships sailed to Egypt as the maritime routes of Southern Asia were not under the control of a single power.<ref name=Lach1/>

====Pre-Columbian trade====

[[Image:Inca-roads-map.png|thumb|190px|Major highways of the Inca road system.{{Imagefact|date=November 2007}}]]
{{further|[[Inca road system]]}}
Some similarities between the [[Mesoamerica]]n and the [[Andean]] cultures suggest that the two regions became a part of a wider world system, as a result of trade, by the 1st millennium BCE.<ref>Denemark 2000: 252</ref> The current academic view is that the flow of goods across the Andean slopes was controlled by institutions distributing locations to local groups, who were then free to access them for trading.<ref name=Denemark5/> This trade across the Andean slopes - described sometimes as "vertical trade" - may have overshadowed the long distance trade between the people of the Andes and the neighboring forests.<ref name=Denemark5/> The Callawaya herbalists traded in tropical plants between 6th and the 10th centuries, while copper was dealt by specialized merchants in the [[Peruvian]] valley of [[Chincha]].<ref name=Denemark5/> Long distance trade may have seen local elites resorting to struggle in order for manipulation and control.<ref name=Denemark5>Denemark 2000: 239</ref> 

Prior to the [[Inca]] dominance, specialized long distance merchants provided the highlanders with goods such as gold nuggets, copper hatches, cocoa, salt etc. for redistribution among the locals, and were key players in the politics of the region.<ref name=Denemark6>Denemark 2000: 241</ref> Hatchet shaped copper currency was produced by the [[Peruvian people]], in order to obtain valuables from [[pre Columbian]] [[Ecuador]].<ref name=Denemark6/> A maritime exchange system stretched from the west coast of [[Mexico]] to southernmost Peru, trading mostly in [[Spondylus]], which represented rain, fertility and was considered the principal food of the gods by the people of the [[Inca empire]].<ref name=Denemark6/>  Spondylus was used in elite rituals and the effective redistribution of it had political effect in the Andes during the pre-Hispanic times.<ref name=Denemark6/>

===Predominantly overland routes===

====Silk Route====

{{main|Silk Road}}
[[Image:Transasia trade routes 1stC CE gr2.png|thumb|350px|right|Trading routes used around the 1st century CE centred on the Silk Road.]]
The Silk road was one of the first trade routes to join the [[Eastern world|Eastern]] and the [[Western world]]s.<ref name=Elisseeff1>Elisseeff 2000: 326</ref> According to Vadime Elisseeff (2000):<ref name=Elisseeff1/>

<blockquote>
"Along the Silk Roads, technology traveled, ideas were exchanged, and friendship and understanding between East and West were experienced for the first time on a large scale. Easterners were exposed to Western ideas and life-styles, and Westerners too, learned about Eastern culture and its spirituality-oriented cosmology. [[Buddhism]] as an Eastern religion received international attention through the Silk Roads."
</blockquote>

Cultural interactions patronized often by powerful emperors, such as [[Kanishka]], led to development of art due to introduction of a rich variety of influences.<ref name=Elisseeff1/> [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism|Buddhist missions]] thrived along the Silk Roads, partly due to the conducive intermixing of trade and cultural values, which created a series of safe stoppages for both the pilgrims and the traders.<ref name=Elisseeff2>Elisseeff 2000: 5</ref> Among the frequented routes of the Silk Route was the [[Myanmar|Burmese]] route extending from [[Bhamo]], which served as a path for [[Marco Polo]]'s visit to [[Yunnan]] and Indian Buddhist missions to [[Canton]] in order to establish [[Buddhist monasteries]].<ref name=Elisseeff3>Elisseeff 2000: 14</ref> This route -  often under the presence of hostile tribes -  also finds mention in the works of [[Rashid al-Din]].<ref name=Elisseeff3/>

====Grand Trunk Road====

{{main|Grand Trunk Road}}
The Grand Trunk Road - connecting [[Calcutta]] in India to [[Peshawar]] in [[Pakistan]] - has existed for over two and a half [[millennia]].<ref name=Elisseeff4>Elisseeff 2000: 158</ref> One of the important trade routes of the world, this road has been a strategic artery with [[fortress]]es, halting posts, [[well]]s, [[post office]]s, [[milestone]]s and other facilities.<ref name=Elisseeff4/> Part of this road through Pakistan also coincided with the Silk Road.<ref name=Elisseeff4/>

This highway has been associated with emperors [[Chandragupta Maurya]] and [[Sher Shah Suri]], the latter became synonymous with this route due to his role in ensuring the safety of the travelers and the upkeep of the road.<ref name=Elisseeff5>Elisseeff 2000: 161</ref> Emperor Sher Shah widened and realigned the road to other routes, and provided approximately 1700 roadside [[inn]]s through his empire.<ref name=Elisseeff5/> These inns provided free food and lodgings to the travelers regardless of their status.<ref name=Elisseeff5/>

The British occupation of this road was of special significance for the [[British Raj]] in India.<ref name=Elisseeff6>Elisseeff 2000: 163</ref> Bridges, pathways and newer inns were constructed by the British for the first thirty seven years of their reign since the occupation of [[Punjab]] in 1849.<ref name=Elisseeff6/> The British followed roughly the same alignment as the old routes, and at some places the newer routes ran parallel to the older routes.<ref name=Elisseeff6/>

Vadime Elisseeff (2000) comments on the Grand Trunk Road:<ref>Elisseeff 2000: 178</ref>
<blockquote>
"Along this road marched not only the mighty armies of conquerors, but also the caravans of traders, scholars, artists, and common folk. Together with people, moved ideas, languages, customs, and cultures, not just in one, but in both directions. At different meeting places -  permanent as well as temporary - people of different origins and from different cultural backgrounds, professing different faiths and creeds, eating different foods, wearing different clothes, and speaking different languages and dialects would meet one another peacefully. They would understand one another's food, dress, manner, and etiquette, and even borrow words, phrases, idioms and, at times, whole languages from others."
</blockquote>

====Amber Road====

[[Image:Rota do Ã¢mbar.jpg|thumb|170px|The Amber Route.{{Imagefact|date=November 2007}}]]
{{main|Amber Road}}
The Amber Road was a European trade route associated with the trade and transport of [[amber]].<ref name=Burns1>Burns 2003: 213</ref> Amber satisfied the criteria for long distance trade as it was light in weight and was in high demand for ornamental purposes around the Mediterranean.<ref name=Burns1/> Before the establishment of Roman control over areas such as [[Pannonia]], the Amber Road was virtually the only route available for long distance trade.<ref name=Burns1/> 

Towns along the Amber Road began to rise steadily during the 1st century CE, despite the troop movements under [[Vespasian|Titus Flavius Vespasianus]] and his son [[Domitian|Titus Flavius Domitianus]].<ref>Burns 2003: 216</ref>
Under the reign of [[Tiberius|Tiberius Caesar Augustus]], the Amber Road was straightened and paved according to the prevailing urban standards.<ref name=Burns2>Burns 2003: 211</ref> Roman towns began to appear along the road, initially founded near the site of [[Celts|Celtic]] ''[[oppida]]''.<ref name=Burns2/>

The 3rd century saw the [[Danube]] river become the principal artery of trade, eclipsing the Amber Road and other commercial routes.<ref name=Burns1/> The redirection of investment to the Danubian forts saw the towns along the Amber Road growing slowly, though yet retaining their prosperity.<ref>Burns 2003: 229</ref> The prolonged struggle between the Romans and the barbarians further left its mark on the towns along the Amber Road.<ref>Burns 2003: 231</ref>

====Via Maris====

[[Image:Ancient Levant routes.png|thumb|right|220px|The Via Maris (purple), [[King's Highway (ancient)|King's Highway]] (red), and other ancient Levantine trade routes, c. 1300 BCE.]]
{{main|Via Maris}}
Via Maris, literally [[Latin]] for "the way of the sea,"<ref>Orlinsky 1981: 1064</ref> was an ancient highway used by the Romans and the [[Crusaders]].<ref name=Orlinsky1>Orlinsky 1981: 1065</ref> The states controlling the Via Maris were in a position to grant access for trade to their own citizens and collect tolls from the outsiders to maintain the trade route.<ref name=Silver1>Silver 1983: 49</ref> The name ''Via Maris'' is a Latin translation of a [[Hebrew]] phrase related to [[Isaiah]].<ref name=Orlinsky1/> Due to the [[Biblical]] significance of this ancient route, many attempts to find its present day location have been made by [[Christian]] pilgrims.<ref name=Orlinsky1/> 13th century traveler and pilgrim Burchard of [[Mount Zion]] refers to the Via Maris route as a way leading along the shore of the [[Sea of Galilee]].<ref name=Orlinsky1/>

====Trans Saharan trade====

Early Muslim writings confirm that the people of [[West Africa]] operated a sophisticated network of trade, usually under the authority of a monarch who levied taxes and provided bureaucratic and military support to his kingdom.<ref name=EB1>western Africa, history of (Encyclopedia Britannica 2002)</ref> Sophisticated mechanisms for the economic and political development of the involved African areas were in place before [[Islam]] further strengthened trade, towns and government in western Africa.<ref name=EB1/> The capital, court and trade of the region find mention in the works of scholar [[AbÅ« 'Ubayd 'Abd AllÄh al-BakrÄ«]]; the mainstay of the trans [[Saharan]] trade was gold and salt.<ref name=EB1/>

The powerful Saharan tribes, [[Berber people|Berber]] in origin and later adapting to Muslim and Arab cultures, controlled the channels to western Africa by making efficient use of horse-drawn vehicles and pack animals.<ref name=EB1/> The [[Songhai]] engaged in a struggle against the Sa'di dynasty of [[Morocco]] over the control of the trans Saharan trade, resulting in damage on both sides and a weak Moroccan victory, further strengthening the uninvolved Saharan tribes.<ref name=EB1/> Struggles and disturbances continued till the 14th century, by which the [[MandÃ©]] merchants were trading with the [[Hausa]], between [[Lake Chad]] and the [[Niger]].<ref name=EB1/> Newer trade routes developed following extension of trade.<ref name=EB1/>

====Hanseatic trade====

{{main|Hanseatic League}}
[[Image:Haupthandelsroute Hanse.png|thumb|290px|Main trading routes of the Hanseatic League.]]
Shortly before the 12th century the [[Germans]] played a relatively modest role in the north European trade.<ref>Dollinger 1999: page 9</ref> However, this was to change with the development of Hanseatic trade, as a result of which German traders became prominent in the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and the [[North Sea]] regions.<ref>Dollinger 1999: page 42</ref> Following the death of [[Eric VI of Denmark]], German forces attacked and sacked [[Denmark]], bringing with them artisans and merchants under the new administration which controlled the Hansa regions.<ref name=Dollinger1>Dollinger 1999: page 54</ref> During the third quarter of the 14th century the Hanseatic trade faced two major difficulties: economic conflict with the [[Flanders]] and hostilities with Denmark.<ref name=Dollinger2>Dollinger 1999: 62</ref> These events led to the formation of an organized association of Hanseatic towns, which replaced the earlier union of German merchants.<ref name=Dollinger2/> This new Hansa of the towns - aimed at protecting interests of the merchants and trade - became prominent for the next hundred and fifty years.<ref name=Dollinger2/>

Philippe Dollinger associates the downfall of the Hansa to a new alliance between [[Lubeck]], [[Hamburg]] and [[Bremen]], which outshadowed the older institution.<ref name=Dollinger3>Dollinger 1999: page xix</ref> He further sets the date of dissolution of the Hansa at 1630<ref name=Dollinger3/> and concludes that the Hansa was almost entirely forgotten by the end of the 18th century.<ref name=Dollinger4>Dollinger 1999: page xx</ref> Scholar [[Georg Friedrich Sartorius]] published the first [[monograph]] regarding the community in the early years of the 19th century.<ref name=Dollinger4/>

==Modern routes==
[[Image:Amurbridge.jpg|thumb|350px|The Trans-Siberian Railway route features many bridges, the longest being [[Khabarovsk Bridge]] (1916).]]
The [[modern times]] saw development of newer means of transport and often controversial [[free trade]] agreements, which altered the political and logistical approach prevalent during the Middle Ages. Newer means of transport led to the establishment of new routes, and countries opened up borders to allow trade in mutually agreed goods as per the prevailing free trade agreement. Some old trading route were reopened during the modern times, although in different political and logistical scenarios.<ref name=BBC1>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5150682.stm Historic India-China link opens (BBC)]</ref> The entry of harmful foreign pollutants by the way of trade routes has been a cause of alarm during the modern times.<ref name=Schulze1>Schulze & Ursprung 2003: 104</ref>  A conservative estimate stresses that future damages from harmful animal and plant diseases may be as high as 134 billion US dollars in the absence of effective measures to prevent the introduction of unwanted pests through various trade routes.<ref name=Schulze1/>

The 1844 Railway act of [[England]] compelled at least one [[train]] to a station every day with the third class fares priced at a [[penny]] a mile.<ref>Seaman 1973: 29-30</ref> Trade benefited as the workers and the lower classes had the ability to travel to other towns frequently.<ref name=Seaman1>Seaman 1973: 30</ref> Suburban communities began to develop and towns began to spread outwards.<ref name=Seaman1/> The British constructed a vast railway network in India, but it was considered to serve a strategic purpose in addition to the commercial purpose.<ref>Seaman 1973: 348</ref> The efficient use of rail routes helped in the unification of the [[United States of America]].<ref name=Seaman2/>

The modern times saw nations struggle for the control of rail routes: The [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] was intended to be used by the [[Russia]]n government for control of [[Manchuria]] and later China; the [[Germany|German]] forces wanted to establish [[Berlin-Baghdad Railway]] in order to influence the Near East; and the [[Austria]]n government planned a route from [[Vienna]] to [[Salonika]] for control of the [[Balkans]].<ref name=Seaman2>Seaman 1973: 379</ref>

According to the [[Encyclopedia Britannica]] (2002):

<blockquote>
Railroads reached their maturity in the early 20th century, as trains carried the bulk of land freight and passenger traffic in the [[industrialized countries]] of the world. By the mid-20th century, however, they had lost their preeminent position. The private automobile had replaced the railroad for short passenger trips, while the airplane had usurped it for long-distance travel, especially in the United States. Railroads remained effective, however, for transporting people in high-volume situations, such as commuting between the centres of large cities and their suburbs, and medium-distance travel of less than about 300 miles between urban centres.
<br><br>
Although railroads have lost much of the general-freight-carrying business to semi-trailer trucks, they remain the best means of transporting large volumes of such bulk commodities as coal, grain, chemicals, and ore over long distances. The development of [[containerization]] has made the railroads more effective in handling finished merchandise at relatively high speeds. In addition, the introduction of piggyback flatcars, in which truck trailers are transported long distances on specially-designed cars, has allowed railroads to regain some of the business lost to trucking.

===Modern road networks===
{{Main|Road}}
[[Image:Los Angeles Freeway Interchange.jpg|thumb|right|200px|High-capacity freeway [[Interchange (road)|interchange]] in [[Los Angeles, California]], [[USA]].]]
The advent [[motor vehicles]] created a demand for better use of highways.<ref name=automotive>automotive industry (Encyclopedia Britannica 2002)</ref> Roads evolved into two way roads, [[expressway]]s, [[freeway]]s and [[tollway]]s during the modern times.<ref name=EBroads>roads and highways (Encyclopedia Britannica 2002)</ref> Existing roads were developed and highways were designed according to intended use.<ref name=automotive/>

[[Trucks]] came into widespread use in the Western World during [[World War I]], and quickly gained reputation as a means of long distance transportation of goods.<ref name=truck>truck (Encyclopedia Britannica 2002)</ref> Modern highways, such as the [[Trans-Canada Highway]], [[Highway 1 (Australia)]] and [[Pan-American Highway]] allowed transport of goods and services across great distances. Automobiles continue to play a crucial role in the economies of the Industrialized countries, resulting in rise of businesses such as motor freight operation and truck transportation.<ref name=automotive/>

The emission rate for cars using highways has been on a decline  between 1975 and 1995 due to regulations and the introduction of [[unleaded petrol]].<ref name=Schwela>Schwela & Zali 2003: 156</ref> This trend is especially notable since there has been a growth in vehicles and vehicle miles traveled by automobiles using these highways.<ref name=Schwela/>

===Modern maritime routes===
{{main|Ship transport}}
[[Image:Canals USA 1825.png|thumb|220px|Canals in the US circa 1825.]]

A consistent shift from land based trade to sea based trade has been recorded since the last three millennia.<ref name=Denemark282> Denemark 2000: 282</ref> The strategic advantages of port cities as trading centers are many: they are both less dependent on vital connections and less vulnerable to blockages.<ref name=Denemark283/> Oceanic ports can help forge trading relationships with other parts of the world easily.<ref name=Denemark283> Denemark 2000: 283</ref>

Modern maritime trade routes - sometimes in the form of artificial [[canals]] like the [[Suez Canal]] - had visible impact on the economic and political standing of nations.<ref name=Carter1/> The opening of the Suez Canal altered British interactions with the colonies of the [[British Empire]] as the dynamics of transportation, trade and communication had now changed drastically.<ref name=Carter1>Carter 2004</ref> Other [[waterways]], like the [[Panama Canal]] played an important role in the histories of many nations.<ref>Major 1993</ref> Inland water transportation remained significantly important even as the advent of railroads and automobiles resulted in a steady decline of canals.<ref name=EBcanals/> Inland water transport is still used for the transportation of bulk commodities eg. grains, coal, and ore.<ref name=EBcanal2>canals and inland waterways (Encyclopedia Britannica 2002)</ref>

Waterway commerce was historically important to Europe, particularly to Russia.<ref name=EBcanals/> According to the Encyclopedia Brittanica (2002): "Russia has been a significant beneficiary. Not only have inland waterways opened vast areas of its interior to development, but Moscow-linked to the [[White sea|White]], [[Baltic sea|Baltic]], [[Black sea|Black]], [[Caspian sea|Caspian]], and [[Azov sea|Azov]] seas by canals and rivers-has become a major inland port."<ref name=EBcanals>canal (Encyclopedia Britannica 2002)</ref>

[[Oil spills]] are recorded both in case of maritime routes and pipeline routes to the main refineries.<ref name=Krech/> Oil spills, amounting to as much as 7.56 billion liters of oil entering the oceans every year, occur due to damaged equipment or human error.<ref name=Krech>Krech et al. 2003: 966</ref>

===Free Trade Areas===
{{main|Free Trade Area}}
[[Image:EFTA countries.PNG|thumb|195px|{{legend|#008000|European Free Trade Association member states.}}
{{legend|#66FF99|Former member states, now European Union member states.}}]]
Historically, governments followed a policy of protection of trade.<ref name=Columbia2>[http://www.bartelby.org/65/fr/freetrad.html free trade. The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2001-05.]</ref> International [[Free Trade]] became visible in 1860 with the Anglo-French commercial treaty and the sentiment further gained momentum during the post [[World War II]] era.<ref name=Columbia2/> 

According to [[The Columbia Encyclopedia]], Sixth Edition:<ref name=Columbia2/>

<blockquote>
"After World War II, strong sentiment developed throughout the world against protection and high tariffs and in favor of freer trade. The results were new organizations and agreements on international trade such as the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (1948), the [[Benelux Economic Union]] (1948), the [[European Economic Community]] (Common Market, 1957), the [[European Free Trade Association]] (1959), [[Mercosur]] (the Southern Cone Common Market, 1991), and the [[World Trade Organization]] (1995). In 1993, the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) was approved by the governments of Canada, [[Mexico]], and the United States. In the early 1990s, the nations of the [[European Union]] (the successor organization to the [[Common Market]]) undertook to remove all barriers to the free movement of trade and employment across their mutual borders."
</blockquote>

On May 2004, the United States of America signed the American Free trade Agreement with five [[Central America]]n nations.<ref name=Columbia2/>

===Air routes===
{{main|Air transport}}
[[Image:FedEx DC10.jpg|thumb|200px|[[FedEx]] [[DC-10]].]]
Air transport has become an indispensable part of the modern society.<ref>Button 2004</ref> People having been using air transport both for long and middle distances, with the average route length of long distances being 720 kilometers in Europe and 1220 kilometers in the US.<ref name=Button1>Button 2004: 9</ref> This enormous industry annually carries 1600 million passengers worldwide, and covers a 15 million kilometer network with an annual turnover of 260 billion dollars.<ref name=Button1/>

The national, international and global economies are linked to this mode of transportation, making it vital to many other industries.<ref name=Button1/> Newer trends of liberalization of trade have further led to establishment of routes among nations bound by agreements.<ref name=Button1/> One such example is the American [[Open skies|Open Skies policy]], which led to greater openness in many international markets, but some international restrictions have survived even during the present times.<ref name=Button1/>

Express delivery through international [[cargo airline]]s touched US $ 20 billion in 1998 and, according to the World Trade Organization, is expected to triple in 2015.<ref name=Hindley>Hindley 2004: 41</ref> In 1998, 50 pure cargo service companies operated internationally.<ref name=Hindley/>

===Pipeline networks===
{{main|Pipeline transport}}
[[Image:Btc pipeline route.png|right|340px|thumb|Route of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline.]]
The economic importance of pipeline transport - responsible for a high percentage of oil and natural gas transportation - is often undermined by the general public due to the lack of visibility of this mode.<ref name=EBpipeline/> Generally held to be safer and more economical and reliable than the other modes of transport, this mode has many advantages over rival modes, such as trucks and railways.<ref name=EBpipeline>pipeline (Encyclopedia Britannica 2002)</ref> Examples of modern pipeline transport include [[Alashankou-Dushanzi Crude Oil Pipeline]] and [[Iran-Armenia Natural Gas Pipeline]]. International pipeline transport projects, like the [[Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline]], presently connect modern nation states - in this case [[Azerbaijan]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Turkey]] - through pipeline networks.<ref name=bp1>[http://www.bp.com/genericarticle.do?categoryId=9006669&contentId=7014358 BP Caspian: Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline (Overview)]</ref>

In some select cases, pipelines can even transport solids, such as coal and other minerals, over long distances; short distance transportation of goods such as grain, cement, concrete, solid wastes, pulp etc. is also feasible.<ref name=EBpipeline/>
