'''"The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase"''' is the twenty fourth episode of the [[The Simpsons (season 8)|eighth season]] of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', which originally aired [[May 11]], [[1997]].<ref name="book">{{cite book|last=Richmond |first=Ray|coauthors=Antonia Coffman|title=[[The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to our Favorite Family]] |year=1997 |publisher=Harper Collins Publishers|id=ISBN 0-00-638898-1|pages=p. 228}}</ref> It was written by [[David X. Cohen|David S. Cohen]], [[Dan Greaney]] and [[Steve Tompkins]], with [[Ken Keeler]] coming up with the story.<ref name="book"/> It was directed by [[Neil Affleck]],<ref name="book"/> and saw [[Tim Conway]], [[Gailard Sartain]] and [[Phil Hartman]] guest star.<ref name="book"/><ref name="BBC">{{citeweb|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season8/page24.shtml|title=The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase|accessdate=2007-02-15||author=Martyn, Warren; Wood, Adrian |date=2000|publisher=BBC}}</ref>

It centers around fictional [[pilot episode]]s of non-existent [[television series]] derived from ''The Simpsons''.  The episode is a parody of the tendency of network executives to try to find any reason to [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] characters from a hit series.<ref name="book"/> 

== Plot ==
[[Troy McClure]] hosts a television special introducing three television shows produced using characters from ''The Simpsons''.  The gimmick of the special is that the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX network]], faced with a schedule with only three filled slots (''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Melrose Place]]'', and ''[[The X-Files]]''),<ref name="BBC"/> commissions the producers of ''The Simpsons'' to produce thirty-five different series.  The producers end up churning out three.

=== ''Chief Wiggum, P.I.'' ===
[[Image:Spinoff.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Chief Wiggum and Principal Skinner arrive in New Orleans.]]
[[Clancy Wiggum]] and his son [[Ralph Wiggum|Ralph]] move to [[New Orleans]] with [[Seymour Skinner]] ('Skinny Boy') as Wiggum's sidekick, in what is supposedly a dark police drama (''[[Miami Vice]]'' is satirized most notably, with the characters living on a houseboat, the music that plays in the chase scene with Big Daddy, the opening theme music, and Skinner's unshaven appearance and attire in the opening scene).

After Wiggum proclaims that he will "clean up the city", Ralph is kidnapped by his new nemesis, Big Daddy. Wiggum tracks him down and saves Ralph, but ultimately lets the villain escape, feeling that he will meet him again the following week "in a more exciting and sexy way". The Simpson family make a guest appearance while celebrating [[Mardi Gras]].

The title of this segment, the vehicle Wiggum drives, and the font used in the opening and end scenes are all references to ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]''.

=== ''The Love-matic Grampa'' ===
The next clip is from a [[sitcom]]-style television series about [[Moe Szyslak|Moe]]'s love life.  He receives advice from the [[ghost]] of [[Abraham Simpson]], who was crushed by a falling shelf in a store and subsequently got lost on his way up to Heaven and now possesses Moe's [[Love Tester]] machine.  Moe ends up getting a date, but his dependence on the machine is revealed, and he confesses to receiving advice.  His date is actually happy when she hears this, flattered that Moe would go to all that trouble for her. [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] makes a guest appearance when he visits the bar.  Moe's date, Betty, looks somewhat like [[Tress MacNeille]], the actress who voiced her.<ref name="Yeardleycom">{{cite video | people=Smith, Yeardley|year=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode "The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

Moe's segment has a ''[[Bewitched]]''/''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'' feel to it,<ref name="BBC"/> as well as similarities to ''[[My Mother the Car]]''.<ref name="com">{{cite video | people=Weinstein, Josh; Cohen, David; Greaney, Dan; Keeler, Ken|year=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode "The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The premise as well as the music and animation in the opening sequence also recall ''[[The Smothers Brothers Show]]'', in which a deceased Tom Smothers comes back to earth as an angel to oversee his brother Dick, a swinging bachelor. The first moments of the segment parody ''[[Cheers]]''. The Love-matic Grampa machine singing "[[Daisy Bell]]" in a distorted manner when its electrical circuits are failing is a reference to [[HAL 9000|HAL]] from the 1968 film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.<ref name="BBC"/> Some aspects of the plot recall the 1988 movie ''[[Short Circuit 2]]'' including the idea of a sentient machine giving a man advice on how to speak to women, a scene where the machine is attacked, knocked over and damaged by thugs with crowbars and the subsequent broken speech and confused language spoken by the machine.

=== ''The Simpson Family Smile-Time Variety Hour'' ===
[[Image:The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase.gif|left|thumb|"Lisa" and the real family members doing a skit for their variety hour]]
Homer, [[Marge Simpson|Marge]], [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]] appear in a [[comedy]] show featuring various [[songs]] and skits.  [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] refuses to participate, but is replaced by an attractive [[blonde]] [[super model]].  [[Tim Conway]] guest stars.

This segment is a [[parody]] of ''[[The Brady Bunch Hour]]'', an infamous short-lived spinoff of the 1970s [[sitcom]], considered one of the worst shows of all time.  The replacement of Lisa in the third segment with another girl reflects the recasting of [[Jan Brady]] in the ''Brady Bunch Hour'' when [[Eve Plumb]] refused to participate.  Other shows parodied during the variety show, include ''[[The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour]]'' and ''[[Laugh In]]''.<ref name="com"/>

The songs parodied during the third segment are:
* "[[I Want Candy]]" by [[The Strangeloves]]<ref name="BBC"/>
* "[[Peppermint Twist]]" by Joey Dee and the Starlighters<ref name="BBC"/>
* "[[Whip It]]" by [[Devo]]<ref name="BBC"/>
* "Lollipop" by [[The Chordettes]]<ref name="BBC"/>

===The Future===
Troy ends the special with a look at the upcoming season of ''The Simpsons'', filled with blatantly ridiculous plot twists, such as Homer turning Lisa into a frog using magic powers, the discovery of Bart's two long lost identical brothers, [[Selma Bouvier|Selma]] marrying [[Lenny Leonard|Lenny]], [[Bumblebee Man]], and [[The Itchy & Scratchy Show|Itchy]], and Homer meeting an alien named Ozmodiar, a reference to [[The Great Gazoo]],<ref name="com"/> that only he can see. All of these are examples of [[jumping the shark]], jokingly implying desperate attempts to boost low ratings.

== Production ==
[[Image:Ozmodiar.png|thumb|right|200px|A small green alien called Ozmodiar, that only Homer can see.]]
[[Ken Keeler]] came up with the idea for the episode for a one sentence idea: "Let's do spin-offs".<ref name="Kencom">{{cite video | people=Keeler, Ken|year=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode "The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> After he had pitched the idea it was decided that "it was an idea that ought to work pretty well" and it was produced.<ref name="Kencom"/>

[[Matt Groening]] was uneasy about this episode,<ref name="Mattcom">{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt|year=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode "The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> feeling that its intentionally bad writing and "crazy" plots would be mistranslated as actual bad sitcom writing.<ref name="Mattcom"/> He also didn't like the idea of breaking the fourth wall, by saying that the Simpsons were just actors in a television show.<ref name="Mattcom"/> The idea was again used in the season 11 episode "[[Behind the Laughter]]". Groening later went on to say that the episode "turned out great".<ref name="Mattcom"/>

The character of Ozmodiar was included in the script for an earlier episode but was considered too crazy. When this episode came along he just seemed to fit right in and so was included.<ref name="com"/>  

A self-conscious reference was cut for the broadcast of this episode, and is found on the season 8 [[The Simpsons DVD boxsets|DVD boxset]]. The big-nosed man first seen validating his parking ticket in "[[When Flanders Failed]]" says to Homer and Marge in "The Simpson Family Smile-Time Variety Hour", "How come the sets look [[1977|20 years out of date]]?"<ref name="deleted">{{cite video |year=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season deleted scenes for the episode "The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

Due to the joke in the third segment that Lisa has been replaced, the real Lisa only has one line in the whole episode.<ref name="Yeardleycom"/>

==Reception==
The episode was met with a variety of views. Some loved it, such as ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' who placed the episode 19th in their top 25 Simpsons episode list.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,417748_4,00.html|title=The Family Dynamic|date=[[2003-02-06]]|accessdate=2007-02-02|publisher=Entertainment Weekly}}</ref> Others disliked it, with it being placed 47th on the [[NoHomers.net]] ''50 Worst Episodes'' list, compiled in 2006.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.nohomers.net/showthread.php?t=53699|title=The Official NHC 50 Worst Episodes - Results!|accessdate=2007-02-12|publisher=NoHomers.net}}</ref> The writers of the book ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'' Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood called it, "A very clever spin on the alternates offered by the Treehouse of Horrors run. Each of the spin-offs is very clever in its own way."<ref name="BBC"/>
