'''Estonian''' (''{{Audio|et-eesti keel.ogg|eesti keel}}''; {{pronounced|ˈeːsti ˈkeːl}}) is the official language of [[Estonia]], spoken by about 1.1 million people in Estonia and tens of thousands in various [[émigré]] communities. It is a [[Finno-Ugric languages|Finno-Ugric language]] and is closely related to [[Finnish language|Finnish]].

One distinctive feature that has caused a great amount of interest in [[linguistics|linguists]] is that Estonian has what is traditionally seen as three degrees of [[phoneme]] length: short, long, and "overlong", such that {{IPA|/toto/}}, {{IPA|/toˑto/}} and {{IPA|/toːto/}} are distinct, as are {{IPA|/toto/}}, {{IPA|/totˑo/}}, and {{IPA|/totːo/}}. In actuality, the distinction isn't purely in the phoneme length, and the underlying phonological mechanism is still disputed.

Another feature that sets Estonian apart from most languages is the vowel [[õ]] ({{IPA|[ɤ]}}), a [[close-mid back unrounded vowel|close-mid near-back unrounded vowel]], which is farther back than the [[schwa]] ({{IPA|[ə]}}), but fronter than {{IPA|[o]}}.

Those lines have been interpreted as a claim to reestablish the birthright of the Estonian language. [[Kristjan Jaak Peterson]] (1801-22) the first student at then the German-language [[University of Tartu]] to acknowledge his Estonian origin, is commonly regarded as a herald of [[Estonian literature| Estonian national literature]] and considered the founder of modern Estonian poetry. His birthday on [[March 14]] is celebrated in [[Estonia]] as the [[First language|Mother Tongue]] Day.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=IpR0-OrrwssC&dq Culture and Customs of the Baltic States By Kevin O'Connor; P.126] ISBN 0313331251</ref>

The domination of [[Estonia]] after the [[Northern Crusades]], from the 13th century to 1918 by [[Denmark]], [[Germany]], [[Sweden]], and [[Russia]] resulted few early written literary works in Estonian language. Writings in Estonian became significant only in the 19th century with the spread of the ideas of [[Age of Enlightenment]], during the [[Estophilia#Estophile Enlightenment Period (1750-1840)| Estophile Enlightenment Period ]](1750-1840). Although [[Baltic Germans]] at large regarded the future of Estonians as being a fusion with the Baltic Germans, the Estophile educated class admired the ancient culture of the Estonians and their era of freedom before the conquests by Danes and Germans in the 13 century. <ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=kBZlHdp7tdcC&pg Estonia:Identity and Independence By Jean-Jacques p.84 ISBN 9042008903 ]</ref> 

After the [[Estonian War of Independence]] Estonian language became the [[state language]] of the newly independent country. When the Soviet Union occupied Estonia in 1940, the status of the Estonian language changed overnight. <ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=YgtSqB9oqDIC&dq Encyclopedia of Bilingualism and Bilingual Education By Sylvia Prys Jones, Colin Baker] ISBN 1853593621</ref> In the second half of the 1970s, the pressure of [[Russification]] and bilingualism intensified. The Russian language was termed as ‘the language of friendship of nations’, and was taught to Estonian children as early as in kindergarten. At the same time teaching Estonian to non-Estonians was considered unnecessary<ref>[http://www.estonica.org/eng/lugu.html?kateg=43&menyy_id=99&alam=61&leht=11 Russification]at estonica.org</ref> During the [[Perestroika]] era The Law on the Status of the Estonian Language was adopted in January 1989. The collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] led to the restoration of [[Estonia|Republic of Estonia]]'s [[History of Estonia#Regaining independence|independence]]. Estonian went back to being the only [[state language]] in Estonia.

==Estonian literature==
{{main|Estonian literature}}
The oldest records of written Estonian date from the 13th century. ''Originates Livoniae'' in [[Chronicle of Henry of Livonia]] contains Estonian place names, words and fragments of sentences. The earliest extant samples of connected Estonian are the so-called Kullamaa prayers dating from 1524 and 1528.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=owQBH74N8CIC&pg Aspects of Altaic Civilization
 By Denis Sinor] ISBN 0700703802</ref>The first known printed book in the language is a bilingual German-Estonian translation of the Lutheran catechism by S.Wanradt and J. Koell dating to 1535, during the [[Protestant Reformation]] period. For the use of priests an Estonian grammar was printed in German in 1637.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=CnckpL8auSIC&pg Dictionary of Languages By Andrew Dalby; p. 182] ISBN 0231115695</ref> [[The New Testament]] was translated into [[Võro language|southern Estonian]] in 1686 (northern Estonian, 1715). The two dialects were united based on northern Estonian by Anton Thor Helle. Writings in Estonian became more significant in the 19th century during the [[Estophilia#Estophile Enlightenment Period (1750-1840)| Estophile Enlightenment Period]] (1750-1840).

In modern times [[Jaan Kross]]<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?as_q=&num=20&btnG=Google+Search&&as_auth=Jaan+Kross Jaan Kross] at google.books</ref> and [[Jaan Kaplinski]]<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?as_q=&num=20&btnG=Google+Search&&as_auth=Jaan+Kaplinski Jaan Kaplinski] at google.books</ref> remain as two of [[Estonia]]'s best known and most translated writers.

==Classification==
Estonian belongs to the [[Finnic languages|Finnic]] branch of the [[Finno-Ugric languages]]. Estonian is thus closely related to [[Finnish language|Finnish]], spoken on the other side of the [[Gulf of Finland]], and is one of the few languages of Europe that is not [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]. Despite some overlaps in the vocabulary due to borrowings, in terms of its origin, Estonian is not related to its nearest neighbours, [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]] and [[Russian language|Russian]], which are all Indo-European languages.

Estonian is distantly related to [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] (though there is no mutual intelligibility between the two). It has been influenced by [[German language|German]] (initially [[Middle Low German]], later also [[standard German]]), [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Latvian language|Latvian]], though it is not related to them [[language family|genetically]].

Like Finnish and Hungarian, Estonian is an [[agglutinative language]], but unlike them, it has lost the [[vowel harmony]] of [[Proto-Finno-Ugric]], although in older texts the vowel harmony is still to be recognized. Furthermore, the [[apocope]] of word-final sounds is extensive and has caused a shift from a purely agglutinative to an inflected language. The basic word order is [[Subject Verb Object]].

==Dialects==
The Estonian dialects are divided into two groups - the northern and southern dialects, usually associated with the cities of [[Tallinn]] in the north and [[Tartu]] in the south, in addition to a distinct ''kirderanniku'' dialect, that of the ''northeastern coast'' of Estonia.

The northern group consists of the ''kesk'' or middle dialect that is also the basis for the standard language, the ''lääne'' or western dialect, roughly corresponding to [[Läänemaa]] and [[Pärnumaa]], the ''saarte'' (islands') dialect of [[Saaremaa]] and [[Hiiumaa]] and the ''ida'' or eastern dialect on the northwestern [[shore]] of [[Lake Peipsi]].

The southern group consists of the Tartu, Mulgi, Võro and Seto dialects. These are sometimes considered either variants of a [[South Estonian language]], or separate languages altogether. Also, [[Seto language|Seto]] is not usually considered a dialect of Estonian, but rather a variant of [[Võro language|Võro]].

==Writing system==
===Alphabet===
{{mainarticle|Estonian alphabet}}

Like Finnish, Estonian employs the [[Latin alphabet]], in addition to which the [[Estonian alphabet]] contains letters ''š'', ''ž'', ''ä'', ''ö'', ''ü'', and ''õ''. The letters ''c'', ''q'', ''w'', ''x'' and ''y'' are limited to [[proper names]] of foreign origin, and ''f'', ''z'', ''š'', and ''ž'' appear in loanwords and foreign names only. ''Ö'', and ''ü'' are pronounced similarly to their equivalents in German. Unlike in standard German, ''Ä'' is pronounced [æ], as in English ''mat''. The vowels Ä, Ö and Ü are, unlike in German, clearly separate phonemes and inherent in Estonian, although the letter shapes come from German. The letter ''õ'' denotes {{IPA|/ɤ/}}, unrounded {{IPA|/o/}}, or a [[close-mid back unrounded vowel]]. (It has a different sound from the same letter in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. It is similar to the [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] [[и]], [[Russian language|Russian]] [[Yery|ы]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] [[Turkish dotted and dotless I|ı]] and the [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] [[ơ]].)

===Orthography===
Estonian orthography is essentially phonemic with each phoneme of the language represented by exactly one grapheme. Exceptions to this derive from historical agreements: for example the initial letter 'h' in words, preservation of the morpheme in [[declension]] of the word (writing b, g, d in places where p, k, t is pronounced) and in the use of 'i' and 'j'. Where it is very impractical or impossible to type ''š'' and ''ž'', they are substituted with ''sh'' and ''zh'' in some written texts, although this is considered incorrect. Otherwise, the ''h'' in ''sh'' represents a [[voiceless glottal fricative]], as in ''[[Pasha (disambiguation)|pasha]]'' (''pas-'ha''); this also applies to some foreign names.

Modern Estonian orthography is based on the ''Newer Orthography'' created by [[Eduard Ahrens]] in the second half of the 19th century based on Finnish Orthography. The ''Older Orthography'' it replaced was created in the 17th century by [[Bengt Gottfried Forselius]] and [[Johann Hornung]] based on [[German language|standard German]] orthography. Earlier writing in Estonian had by and large used an ''ad hoc'' orthography based on [[Latin]] and [[Middle Low German]] orthography. Some influences of the standard German orthography &mdash; for example, writing 'W'/'w' instead of 'V'/'v' persisted well into the 1930s. 

It should be noted that Estonian words and names quoted in international publications from Soviet sources are often incorrect back-transliterations from the Russian transliteration. Examples are the use of "ya" for "ä" (e.g. Pyarnu instead of the correct Pärnu) and "y" instead of "õ" (e.g., Pylva instead of the correct Põlva). Even in the "Encyclopaedia Britannica" one can find "ostrov Khiuma", where "ostrov" means "island" in Russian and "Khiuma" is back-transliteration from Russian instead of correct "Hiiumaa" (Hiiumaa>Хийума(а)>Khiuma).

# The mid vowels are not close-mid or open-mid; the usual IPA notation uses these symbols.

There are nine phonemic monophthongs, with three phonetic lengths. Of these, simple and long are segmentally phonemic, and the third length level is suprasegmentally phonemic and aided by a distinctive tonal contour. The script distinguishes only short and long, marked by vowel doubling, e.g. ''öö'' "night". There are 19 segmental diphthongs<ref>Mati Hint. ''Häälikutest sõnadeni.'' Valgus 1978, Tallinn.</ref>, and polysyllablic vowel clusters are also found. There are very few instances of vowel allophony: 'ä' may have pronunciations {{IPA|[æ]}} and {{IPA|[ɛ]}}, and the phoneme {{IPA|/yː/}} is pronounced as the diphthong {{IPA|[yi]}}.

'''Notes''':
#{{IPA|[ŋ]}} only appears as an [[allophone]] of {{IPA|[n]}} before {{IPA|[k]}}
#{{IPA|[f]}} and {{IPA|[ʃ]}} are considered foreign sounds and they only appear in loanwords.

There is one series of stops, unvoiced unaspirated, with three phonemic lengths, written '''b d g''', '''p t k''' and '''pp tt kk'''. The rest of the consonants also have distinctive length, but only short and long are distinguished in writing. As with vowels, two segmental length levels are phonemic, and the third level is  suprasegmentally phonemic. For example, for 'n', short 'n' in ''lina'' "sheet", half-long 'n' in ''linna'' "town's", over-long 'n' in ''linna'' "to the town". The latter addition of length is traceable to a grammatical marker *''-han'' that has elided.

The fricatives are '''s h''', added with '''f š ž z''' for loans. The other consonants are '''j l m n r v''', plus the allophonic [[velar nasal]] in '''nk''' and '''ng'''. Consonants may be palatalized; but this is not written in the orthography, as palatalization generally occurs before front vowels. About 0.15% of the vocabulary features fully phonemic palatalization, where palatalization occurs without the front vowel.  The process is similar to that found in Eastern Finnish dialects, where word-final 'i' is elided, leaving the palatalization on the consonant.  Thus, palatalization does not necessarily need a front vowel, and palatalized vs. plain continuants can be articulated.

[[Proto-Finnic]], the ancestor of the Estonian language, lost palatalization, but Estonian is one of those languages which reacquired it from Slavic. Yet, it underwent further modification, which makes Estonian palatalization different from Russian palatalization. In Russian, palatalization causes some affrication and necessarily features a palatal approximant/fricative offglide, which is not the case in Estonian, where the consonant is otherwise unaffected.

The stress is on the first syllable; however, international loanwords and over-long consonants may alter this pattern. The stress is weak, and as length levels already control an aspect of "articulation intensity", most words appear evenly stressed.

===Gradation===
In Estonian language, sounds [[alternation (linguistics)|alternate]] between various grades of length and stress in different grammatical forms of a word.

====Consonants====

There are two principally different consonant gradation types in Estonian - qualitative and quantitative. 

1) Qualitative changes<br>
1a) deletion of a stop (g, b, d, k, t) or s (''arg : ara, käskida : käsin, tuba : toa, uskuda : usun, mesi : mee'')<br>
1b) assimilation (''kandma : kannan, vars : varre'')<br>
1c) replacement of a weak stop by rules b:v, d:j, g:j (''kaebama : kaevata, rada : raja, märg : märja'')<br>
2) Quantitative changes<br>
2a) alternation of long and short geminate (''pikk : pika, sepp : sepa, võtta : võtan, kirss : kirsi'')<br>
2b) alternation of strong and weak stops (''vilkuda : vilgub, kubjas : kupja, kartma : kardan'').

The strengthening consonant gradation types of nouns are the following:<br>
a) nouns that derived from a verb with consonant gradation, e.g.: ''hinne : hinde'' (verb ''hindama - hinnata - hindan'')<br>
b) nouns that end with s and are in weak grade in singular nominative, but singular genitive is in strong grade and the final s is deleted, e.g  ''saabas : saapa''<br>
c) nouns that end with vowel + r (''vaher : vahtra, tütar : tütre'')<br>
d) nouns that additionally to the gradating stem have stem final change e-me (''liige : liikme, võti : võtme'')<br>

====Vowels====

[[Apophony|Vowel gradation]] is the alternation of II and III grade (''kool : kooli'').

==Grammar==
:''Main article: [[Estonian grammar]]''
Typologically, Estonian represents a transitional form from an [[agglutinating language]] to a [[fusional language]].  Over the course of Estonian history, [[German language|German]] has exercised a strong influence on Estonian, both in vocabulary and syntax.

In Estonian nouns and pronouns do not have [[grammatical gender]], but nouns and adjectives decline in fourteen cases: [[nominative]], [[genitive]], [[Partitive case|partitive]], [[illative]], [[inessive]], [[Elative case|elative]], [[allative]], [[adessive]], [[ablative]], [[translative]], [[terminative]], [[essive]], [[abessive]], and [[comitative]], with the case and number of the adjective(s) always agreeing with that of the noun (except in the terminative, essive, abessive and comitative, where there is agreement only for the number, the adjective being in the genitive form). Thus the illative for "a yellow house" (''kollane maja'') — "into a yellow house" is (''kollasesse majja'').

The direct object of the verb appears either in the [[Accusative case|accusative]] (for total objects) or in the partitive (for partial objects). The accusative coincides with the genitive in the singular and with nominative in the plural. Accusative vs. partitive case opposition of [[Object (grammar)|object]] used with transitive verbs creates a [[telicity]] contrast, just as in Finnish. This is a rough equivalent of the perfect vs. imperfect aspect opposition.<!-- Most books I've seen don't use an accusative case, although I suppose the grammar would make more sense with one. However, when the verb is imperative, the opposition is between nominative and partitive. -->

The verbal system lacks a distinctive future tense (the present tense serves here) and features special forms to express an action performed by an undetermined [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] (the "impersonal").

==Vocabulary==

{{mainarticle|Estonian vocabulary}}

Although the Estonian and [[Germanic language]]s are of completely different origins, one can identify many similar words in Estonian and English, for example. This is primarily due to the fact that the Estonian language has borrowed nearly one third of its vocabulary from [[Germanic languages]], mainly from Low Saxon ([[Middle Low German]]) during the period of [[History of Estonia#The Middle Ages|German rule]], and [[High German]] (including [[standard German]]). The percentage of Low Saxon and High German loanwords can be estimated at 22-25 percent, with Low Saxon making up about 15 percent.

==Language example==
Article 1 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in Estonian:

''Kõik inimesed sünnivad vabadena ja võrdsetena oma väärikuselt ja õigustelt. Neile on antud mõistus ja südametunnistus ja nende suhtumist üksteisesse peab kandma vendluse vaim.''

(All people are born free and equal in their dignity and rights. They are given reason and conscience and they shall create their relationships to one another according to the spirit of brotherhood.)
