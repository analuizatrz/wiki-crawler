The '''University of Texas at Austin''' (often referred to as the '''University of Texas''', '''UT Austin''', '''UT''', or '''Texas''') is a major research university located in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Texas]] and is the [[flagship#University campuses|flagship]] institution of [[University of Texas System|The University of Texas System]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mup.asu.edu/research2007.pdf |title=The Top American Research Universities - 2007 |accessdate=2008-05-06 |format= |work= }}</ref><ref name="flagship1">{{cite news | url=http://www.utexas.edu/opa/news/2005/07/mcdonald21.html | title=Texas flagship universities celebrate milestone of Giant Magellan Telescope partnership | publisher=University of Texas | date=2005-07-21 | accessdate=2006-09-28}}</ref><ref name="flagship4">{{cite web | url=http://www.nndb.com/edu/364/000082118/ | title=University of Texas | work=NNDB | accessdate=2006-09-28}}</ref><ref name="flagship5">{{cite news | url=http://washingtontimes.com/culture/20051002-103300-6882r.htm | title=Flagship university of Texas seeks to boost diversity | author=Austin, Liz | date=2005-10-03 | accessdate=2006-09-28}}</ref> The main campus is located less than a mile from the [[Texas State Capitol]]. UT Austin was named one of the original eight [[Public Ivy]] institutions.<ref>''The Public Ivies: America's Flagship Public Universities'' (2001) by Howard and Matthew Greene</ref> Founded in 1883, the university has had [[List of largest United States universities by enrollment|the fifth largest]] single-campus enrollment in the nation as of fall 2007 (and had the largest enrollment in the country from 1997&ndash;2003), with over 50,000 undergraduate and graduate students and 16,500 faculty and staff.<ref name="EnrEss" /> It currently holds the [[List of largest Texas universities by enrollment|largest enrollment]] of all colleges in the state of Texas.<ref>http://www.txhighereddata.org/Reports/DocFetch.cfm?DocID=1434&Format=XLS&Confirmed=1</ref> 

The university operates various auxiliary facilities aside from the main campus, most notably the [[J. J. Pickle Research Campus]]. UT Austin is a major center for academic research, annually exceeding $400 million in funding.<ref name="EnrEss" /> In addition, the university's athletic programs were recognized by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' as "America's Best Sports College" in 2002.

==History==
{{main|History of the University of Texas at Austin}}
[[Image:UT tower lit entirely in orange.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Main Building (University of Texas at Austin)|UT Austin Tower]], built in 1931, stands 307 ft (94 m) tall and dons [[Main Building (University of Texas at Austin)#Lighting|different colors of lighting on special occasions.]]]]
[[Image:Oldmainbuilding.jpg|right|thumbnail|The university's Old Main Building in 1903]]
The first mention of a public university in [[Texas]] can be traced to the 1827 constitution for the [[Mexico|Mexican]] state of [[Coahuila y Tejas]]. Although an article promised to establish public education in the arts and sciences, no action was ever taken by the Mexican government. After Texas obtained its [[Texas Declaration of Independence|independence]] from Mexico in 1836, the Congress of Texas adopted the [[Constitution of the Republic of Texas|Constitution of the Republic]], which included a provision to establish public education in [[Republic of Texas|republic]], including two universities or colleges. On [[January 26]], [[1839]], the Congress of Texas agreed to eventually set aside fifty [[league (unit)|league]]s of land towards the effort; in addition, forty acres in the new capital of Austin were reserved and designated "College Hill."

In 1846, Texas was [[Texas Annexation|annexed]] into the [[United States]]. The state legislature passed the [[Act of 1858]], which set aside $100,000 in United States [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] towards construction. In addition, the legislature designated land, previously reserved for the encouragement of railroad construction, toward the universities' fifty leagues. However, Texas's [[secession]] from the Union and the [[American Civil War]] prevented further action on these plans.

The passing of the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act|Morrill Act]] in 1862 facilitated the creation of [[Texas A&M University]], which was established in 1876 as the Agricultural & Mechanical College of Texas.<ref>[http://www.tsha.utexas.edu/handbook/online/articles/TT/kct8.html Texas A&M University] ''Handbook of Texas Online.'' Accessed [[29 July]] [[2006]].</ref> The [[Texas Constitution|Texas Constitution of 1876]] mandated that the state establish a university "at an early day," calling for the creation of a "university of the first class," The University of Texas. It revoked the endowment of the railroad lands of the Act of 1858 but appropriated one million acres (4000 km²) in West Texas. In 1883, another two million were granted, with income from the sale of land and [[grazing rights]] going to The University of Texas and Texas A&M.

In 1881, Austin was chosen as the site of the main university, and Galveston was designated the location of the medical department. On the original "College Hill," an official ceremony began construction on what is now referred to as the old Main Building in late 1882. The university opened its doors on [[September 15]], [[1883]].

The old [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]]-[[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic]] [[Main Building of The University of Texas at Austin|Main Building]] served as the central point of the campus's forty acre site, and was used for nearly all purposes. However, by the 1930s, discussions rose about the need for new library space, and the Main Building was razed in 1934 over the objections of many students and faculty. The modern-day tower and Main Building were constructed in its place.

Constitutional restrictions against funding building construction hampered expansion. However, the funds generated by [[petroleum|oil]] discovered on university-owned grounds in 1923 were put towards its general endowment fund. This extra revenue allowed the university to pay down its debt, and pass bond in 1931 and 1947, funding the necessary expansion after the enrollment spike following [[World War II]]. The university built 19 permanent structures between 1950 and 1965, when it was given the right of [[eminent domain]]. With this power, the university purchased additional properties surrounding the original forty acres.

UT property totals 850 acres (3.4 km²), comprised of the 350 acres (1.4 km²) for the main campus and other land for the [[J.J. Pickle Research Campus]] in north Austin and the other properties throughout Texas.

One of the university's most visible features is the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] [[Main Building of The University of Texas at Austin|Main Building]], including a {{convert|307|ft|m|sing=on}} tower designed by [[Paul Philippe Cret]].<ref>[http://www.utexas.edu/tours/mainbuilding/ The Main Building] ''The University of Texas.'' Accessed [[1 December]] [[2005]].</ref> Completed in 1937, the Main Building is located in the middle of campus. The tower usually appears illuminated in white light in the evening but is lit orange for various special occasions, including athletic victories and academic accomplishments; it is conversely darkened for solemn occasions.<ref>[http://www.utexas.edu/opa/pubs/oncampus/02oc_issues/oc020129/oc_tower.html University approves new policy for lighting UT Tower] ''On Campus.'' Accessed [[1 December]] [[2005]].</ref> At the top of the tower is a [[carillon]] of 56 bells, the largest in Texas. Songs are played on weekdays by resident carillonneur Tom Anderson, in addition to the usual pealing of [[Westminster Quarters]] every quarter hour between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m.{{Fact|date=April 2008}} The tower went through a few periods of being closed to the public (due to the [[Charles Whitman#Tower shootings|1966 Whitman Massacre]]<ref>{{cite web | title=After decades of silence, UT acknowledged shootings | first=Victoria | last=Rossi | date=[[August 1]], [[2006]] | publisher=[[Daily Texan]] | url=http://www.dailytexanonline.com/news/2006/08/01/TowerMassacre40YearsLater/After.Decades.Of.Silence.Ut.Acknowledged.Shootings-2142759.shtml | accessdate=2006-08-01}}</ref> and multiple suicide jumps); however, in 1998, after the installation of security and safety measures, the observation deck reopened to the public indefinitely for weekend tours.<ref>[http://www.utexas.edu/student/txunion/ae/towertours/?tours=schedule Tower Tours Schedule Fall 2005] ''The Texas Union.''

[[Image:Johnson library.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum|Lyndon B. Johnson Library and Museum]], located on the UT Austin campus]]

The university is home to 7 museums and 17 libraries, which hold over eight million volumes.<ref>[http://www.lib.utexas.edu/admin/cird/statisticaloverview2005.html Statistical Overview of the Library Collections] ''The University of Texas Libraries.'' Accessed [[1 December]] [[2005]].</ref> The holdings of the university's [[Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center]] include one of only 21 remaining complete copies of the [[Gutenberg Bible]] and the first permanent photograph, ''View from the Window at Le Gras'', taken by [[Nicéphore Niépce]].<ref>[http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/exhibitions/permanent/gutenberg/ The Gutenberg Bible at the Ransom Center] ''Harry Ransom Center.'' Accessed [[1 December]] [[2005]].</ref> The newest museum, the [[Blanton Museum of Art]], opened in April 2006 and hosts approximately 17,000 works from Europe, the United States, and Latin America. 

UT has an extensive underground [[tunnel]] system that links many of the buildings.<ref>[http://www.betterthanyourboyfriend.com/the-secret-tunnels-under-ut.htm The Secret Tunnels Under UT] ''Better Than Your Boyfriend.''</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=April 2008}} The tunnel system, purportedly used for communications and utility service, is closed to the public and is guarded by [[burglar alarm|silent alarms]]. The university also operates a 1.1 megawatt [[Nuclear reactor technology|nuclear reactor]] at the J.J. Pickle Research Campus, which has gone critical twice in its history: once at Taylor Hall in 1963 and again in 1992.<ref name="Nuclear">>[http://www.me.utexas.edu/~nuclear/about.htm Nuclear Engineering Teaching Lab] ''Nuclear and Radiation Engineering Program.''

The university continues to expand its facilities on campus. In February 2006, the Board of Regents voted to update and expand the football stadium, and in March 2006 the student body passed a referendum to build a new Student Activities Center next to Gregory Gym on the east side of campus, pending final approval by the Board of Regents. According to ''The Daily Texan'', the project is estimated to cost $51 million and is set to open between fall 2010 and fall 2012. Funding will primarily come from students, raising tuition by a maximum of $65 per semester.<ref>Terrell, Abby.

A regental policy[http://www.utsystem.edu/OGC/RegentalPolicies/AUFspend.htm] requires that ''at least'' 45 percent of this money go to UT Austin for "program enrichment." By taking two-thirds and multiplying it by 45 percent, we get 30 percent which is the ''minimum'' amount of AUF income that can be distributed to UT Austin under current policies. The Regents, however, can and do decide to allocate additional amounts to UT Austin. Also, the majority of the UT System share of the AUF is used for debt service of UT System [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], some of which were issued for the benefit of UT Austin[http://www.utsystem.edu/CONT/REPORTS/LARs/AUFLAR-102704.pdf]. One should note that the Regents are free to change the 45 percent minimum of the UT System share going to UT Austin at any time, although doing so might be difficult politically.</ref> Proceeds from lands appropriated in 1839 and 1876, as well as oil monies, comprise the majority of PUF. At one time, the PUF was the chief source of income for Texas's two university systems, The University of Texas System and [[Texas A&M University System|the Texas A&M University System]]; today, however, its revenues account for less than 10 percent of the universities' annual budgets. This has challenged the universities to increase sponsored research and private donations. Privately funded endowments contribute over $2 billion to the University's total endowment value.

==Student life==
The university enrolls 37,377 undergraduate, 11,533 graduate and 1,467 law students. The student population includes students from all 50 states and more than 100 foreign countries, most notably, [[South Korea]], followed by [[India]], the [[People's Republic of China]], [[Mexico]] and the [[Republic of China]], are represented.<ref>[http://www.utexas.edu/academic/oir/statistical_handbook/04-05/students/analysis/ 2004-2005 Statistical Handbook, Degrees Conferred] ''The University of Texas Office of Institutional Research.'' Accessed [[1 December]] [[2005]].</ref> The average [[SAT]] score for entering Fall 2004 [[First year|freshmen]] was a 1230 out of 1600.

===Housing===
[[Image:Texas Longhorn.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Texas longhorn]] serves as the [[mascot]] for UT Austin.]]
The campus is currently home to fourteen residence halls, the last of which opened for residence in Spring 2007. On-campus housing can hold more than 7,100 students.<ref>[http://www.utexas.edu/student/housing/pdfs/reshall_masterplan_100405.pdf Residence Hall Master Plan] ''The University of Texas Division of Housing and Food.''

Accessed [[December 2]], [[2005]].</ref>  Academic enrollment exceeds the capacity of on-campus housing; as a result, most students must live in private residence halls, [[housing cooperative]]s, apartments, or with [[fraternities and sororities|Greek organization]]s and other off-campus residences. The Division of Housing and Food Service, which already has the largest market share of 7,000 of the estimated 27,000 beds in the campus area, plans to expand to 9,000 beds in the near future.<ref name="Texan-housing">{{cite news | url=http://www.dailytexanonline.com/media/storage/paper410/news/2006/08/03/TopStories/Ut.Residences.To.Expand-2143178.shtml?norewrite200608032103&sourcedomain=www.dailytexanonline.com | title=UT residences to expand | publisher=The Daily Texan | date=[[3 August]] [[2006]] | accessdate=2006-08-03}}</ref>

===Student organizations===
The university recognizes more than 1,000 student organizations.<ref>[http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sald/about.php About Student Activities and Leadership Development] ''The University of Texas Office of the Dean of Students.'' Accessed [[December 2]], [[2005]].</ref> In addition, it supports three official student governance organizations that represent student interests to faculty, administrators, and the Texas Legislature. Student Government, established in 1902, is the oldest governance organization and represents student interests in general.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.utsg.org/ |title=UT Student Government |accessdate=2008-05-06 |format= |work= }}</ref> The Senate of College Councils represents students in academic affairs and coordinates the college councils,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.utsenate.org/ |title=Senate of College Councils |accessdate=2008-05-06 |format= |work= }}</ref> and the Graduate Student Assembly represents graduate student interests.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.utgsa.org/ |title=Graduate Student Assembly |accessdate=2008-05-06 |format= |work= }}</ref> The Texas Union Student Events Center serves as the hub for student activities on campus.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sec.union.utexas.edu/ |title=Texas Union Student Events Center |accessdate=2008-05-06 |format= |work= }}</ref>

===Greek life===
{{seealso|List of fraternities and sororities at University of Texas at Austin}}
The University of Texas at Austin is home to an active Greek community. The first UT Greek chapters, the Texas Beta chapter of Phi Delta Theta and the Tau Deuteron Chapter of Phi Gamma Delta, both opened in 1883; the same year as the university.<ref name="GreekGuide">{{cite web|title=Sorority & Fraternity Information Guide 2007–2008|work=The University of Texas Office of the Dean of Students|url=http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/gle/downloads/GrkGde07.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate = 2008-04-18}}</ref> Over 11 percent of undergraduate students make up the nearly 4,500 members. With more than 50 national [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity and sorority]] chapters, the university's Greek community is one of the largest in the nation. These [[chapters]] are under the authority of one of UT Austin's five Greek council communities, [[North-American Interfraternity Conference|Interfraternity Council]], [[National Pan-Hellenic Council]], Texas Asian Pan-Hellenic Council, United Greek Council and University Panhellenic Council.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/gle/comm.php|title=Greek communities|author=The University of Texas Office of the Dean of Students|accessdate=2005-12-02}}</ref> Other registered student organizations also name themselves with Greek letters and are called affiliates. They are not a part of one of the five councils but have all of the same privileges and responsibilities of any other organization.<ref name="GreekGuide"/> According to the Office of the Dean of Students' mission statement, Greek Life promotes the principles of cultural appreciation, scholarship, leadership, and [[Community service|service]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/gle/|title=Greek Life and Intercultural Education|author=The University of Texas Office of the Dean of Students|accessdate=2008-04-17}}</ref> While there are no [[fraternity and sorority houses]] located on-campus, the majority are located west of [[The Drag]] in the neighborhood called [[West Campus, Austin, Texas|West Campus]].

===School spirit===
{{seealso|Texas Student Media}}
Traditions at UT Austin are perpetuated through several school symbols and mediums. At athletic events, students frequently sing "[[Texas Fight]]," the university's fight song while displaying the [[Hook 'em Horns]] hand gesture—the gesture mimicking the horns of the school's mascot, [[Bevo (mascot)|Bevo]] the [[Texas longhorn (cattle)|Texas longhorn]].

Students express their opinions in and outside of class through periodicals including ''[[Study Breaks Magazine]]'', ''[[The Daily Texan]]'' (the most award-winning daily college newspaper in the United States),<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.utexas.edu/student/registrar/catalogs/gicurrent/ch5/ch5g.html|title = Student Publications|accessdate = 2007-08-05|work = University of Texas at Austin}}</ref> and the ''[[Texas Travesty]]''. Over the airwaves students' voices are heard through [[K09VR]] and [[KVRX]].

==Athletics==

The University of Texas offers a wide variety of varsity and intramural sports programs. As of 2008, the university's athletics program ranked fifth in the nation among [[Division I]] schools, according to the [[National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics]].<ref>[http://nacda.cstv.com/ National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Due to the breadth of sports offered and the quality of the programs, Texas was selected as "America's Best Sports College" in a 2002 analysis performed by ''[[Sports Illustrated]].''<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/si_online/news/2002/10/01/1_10/ America's Best Sports Colleges] ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''.

However this ranking is based only on clients of the Collegiate Licensing Company which does not handle licensing for approximately three dozen large schools such as [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]], [[University of Southern California|USC]], [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], [[Michigan State University|Michigan State]], and [[Texas A&M University|Texas A&M]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.statesman.com/sports/content/sports/stories/longhorns/08/16/0816royalties.html|title=Texas repeats as national champion in merchandising|publisher=''[[The Austin American-Statesman]]''|accessdate=2007-08-17|date=2007-08-16|author=Maher, John}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clc.com/clcweb/publishing.nsf/Content/rankings.html|title=The Collegiate Licensing Company Rankings|accessdate=2007-08-17}}</ref> 

===Varsity sports===
The university's men's and women's athletics teams are nicknamed the Longhorns. A charter member of the [[Southwest Conference]] until its dissolution in 1996, Texas now competes in the [[Big 12 Conference]] (South Division) of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA's]] [[Division I|Division I-FBS]]. Texas has won 47 total national championships,<ref> [http://www.texassports.com/index.php?s=&change_well_id=2&url_article_id=101 Texas Longhorns Championships History: National Champions] ''TexasSports.com''.

The University of Texas has traditionally been considered a [[college football]] powerhouse.<ref name="Potomac">{{cite book  | url=http://www.potomacbooksinc.com/Books/BookDetail.aspx?productID=167960 | title=Texas Longhorns Football History A to Z | author=Pennington, Richard | publisher=Potomac Books | accessdate=2007-08-04}}</ref><ref name="Tarheel">{{cite news |work=DailyTarheel.com | publisher= The Daily Tarheel | author=Fitt, Aaron | url=http://www.dailytarheel.com/media/storage/paper885/news/2002/09/14/Sportsaturday/Its-Not.About.Mack-1349746.shtml?norewrite200606280132&sourcedomain=www.dailytarheel.com | title=It's not about Mack | date=[[September 14]] [[2002]] | accessdate=2007-08-21}}</ref><ref name="BC$">{{cite news | url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/01/04/commentary/column_sportsbiz/sportsbiz/ | title=Texas is the BC$ champ, too - Even before their stunning upset of [[USC]], the Longhorns were big winners where it matters. |work=CNNMoney | publisher=Turner Broadcasting | date=[[January 5]] [[2006]] | accessdate=2007-04-25}}</ref>  At the start of the 2007 season, the Longhorns were ranked third in the all-time list of both total wins and winning percentage.<ref name="Ark State gw">{{cite news | url=http://www.mackbrown-texasfootball.com/doc_lib/090107_notes.pdf | title=Game notes - Arkansas State | work=MackBrownTexasFootball.com | publisher=University of Texas & Host Interactive | format=PDF | date=[[September 1]][[2007]] | accessdate=2007-09-16}}</ref> The team experienced its greatest success under coach [[Darrell Royal]], winning three national championships in 1963, 1969, 1970, and winning a fourth title under head coach [[Mack Brown]] in 2005 after the 41-38 victory over previously undefeated [[University of Southern California|Southern California]] in the 2006 [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]].

In recent years, the men's [[college basketball|basketball]] team has gained prominence, advancing to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] Sweet Sixteen in 2002, the Final Four in 2003, the Sweet Sixteen in 2004, and the [[Elite Eight]] in 2006 and 2008.

The university's [[college baseball|baseball]] team is considered one of the best in the nation with more trips to the [[College World Series]] than any other school, with wins in 1949, 1950, 1970, 1983, 2002 and 2005.

Additionally, the university's highly successful men's and women's swimming and diving teams lay claim to sixteen NCAA Division I titles.<ref>[http://www.texassports.com/index.php?s=&url_channel_id=20&url_article_id=1733&change_well_id=2 TEXAS LONGHORNS Official Athletic Site<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In particular, the men's team is under the leadership of [[Eddie Reese]], who served as the head men's coach at the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona and the 2004 Games in Athens, and is set to serve as head men's coach at the 2008 games in Beijing.

===Rivalries===
One of the university's notable rivals in many sports is [[Texas A&M Athletics|Texas A&amp;M University]].<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/magazine/features/si50/states/texas/ Sports Illustrated's 50th Anniversary: Texas] ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' poll (conducted by [[Harris Interactive]]) shows 56% of respondents picked Texas vs Texas A&M as the biggest rivalry, followed by Texas vs Oklahoma at 15%, and the Cowboys vs Texans at 7%.</ref> The two schools have acknowledged the importance of this rivalry by creating the [[State Farm]] [[Lone Star Showdown]] series, which encompasses all sports where both schools field a varsity team. The football game played between the two schools is the third longest-running rivalry in the nation and is the longest-running rivalry for both schools. The game used to be played on Thanksgiving day but in recent years has been played on the day following [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]]. As of the 2008 season however the game will be played on Thanksgiving. Both schools traditionally hold a rally each year before the football game &mdash; Texas hosts the [[Hex Rally]], and students at Texas A&M host the [[Aggie Bonfire#Revival|Aggie Bonfire]] (although it is no longer an officially sanctioned Texas A&M event after the deaths of 12 students in 1999). 

Some fans and observers, however, argue that the Longhorns' biggest rival in football is the [[University of Oklahoma]].{{weasel-inline}}<ref>[http://totaljibbly.blogspot.com/2005/11/season-it-never-fails.html The Season] ''Total Jibbly''. [[November 22]], [[2005]].</ref>  The football game between Texas and Oklahoma is known as the [[Red River Shootout]] and is held annually in [[Dallas, Texas]], at the [[Cotton Bowl (stadium)|Cotton Bowl]]. In recent years, this rivalry has been particularly spirited, in part due to the fact that at least one school has been ranked in the top five nationally at the time of the game.

Other schools, such as Arkansas and [[Texas Tech Red Raiders|Texas Tech]], also consider Texas among their rivals.<ref>[http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaaf/preview?gid=200610280086 Texas Longhorns/Texas Tech Raiders Preview Saturday, October 28, 2006] ''[http://sports.yahoo.com/ Yahoo!
