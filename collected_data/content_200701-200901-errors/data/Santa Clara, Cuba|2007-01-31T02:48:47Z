'''Santa Clara''' is the capital city of the [[Cuba]]n province of [[Villa Clara Province|Villa Clara]]. It is located in the most central region of the province and almost in the most central region of the country.

== History ==
{{see|Battle of Santa Clara}}
Santa Clara was the site of the last battle in the [[Cuban Revolution]] in late [[1958]]. There were two guerrilla columns that attacked the city, one led by [[Che Guevara|Ernesto Che Guevara]] and the other led by [[Camilo Cienfuegos]].  Guevara's column first captured the garrison at Fomento. Then, using a bulldozer, Guevara's soldiers destroyed railroad tracks and derailed a train full of troops and supplies sent by [[Fulgencio Batista|Batista]]. At the same time, Cienfuegos's column defeated an army garrison at the [[Battle of Yaguajay]] not far from town. On [[December 31]], [[1958]], the combined forces of Guevara and Cienfuegos (along with other revolutionaries under [[William Alexander Morgan]]) attacked Santa Clara. The battle was chaotic, the defenders were demoralized, some fought, others surrendered without a shot. By the afternoon, the city was captured. This victory for Castro's troops is seen as the decisive moment in the Cuban Revolution as Batista fled Cuba less than 12 hours later.

Prior to [[1 January]] [[1977]], Santa Clara was located in [[Las Villas Province]]. On that date, as part of a general administrating reordering of Cuba's provinces, Las Villas province was reordered into the provinces of [[Villa Clara Province|Villa Clara]], [[Cienfuegos Province|Cienfuegos]], and [[Sancti Spíritus Province|Sancti Spíritus]]. Santa Clara is in the province now known as Villa Clara.

Parque Vidal, Santa Clara is probably one of the most traditional places in Cuba. During the afternoons, people (specially singles) visit the park to meet others. Although not widely practiced in recent times, the custom was to walk the park around and around. The women walk the inner part of the park, while the men walk the outer side. Another lost custom was for the locals to set up a platform and offer improvisations with their guitars on late Sunday afternoons. For that day they dressed with their [[Guayaberas]] and highly polished shoes.
