'''BenQ Corporation''' ({{pronEng|ˌbɛn ˈkjuː}}; {{lang-zh|明基電通股份有限公司}})  is a Taiwanese company specializing in the manufacturing of computing, communications, and consumer electronics devices.

== Name ==

The company was established in 1984, initially known as Acer Peripherals Inc., then [[Acer (company)|Acer]] CM (Communications and Multimedia), and finally rebranded as BenQ<ref>http://www.benq.com/page/?pageId=6</ref> in December 2001. BenQ Corporation is part of the BenQ Group, which also includes [[AU Optronics]].

The name reflects their corporate motto or vision:
'''B'''ringing '''E'''njoyment a'''N'''d '''Q'''uality to life. In June 2007 the company announced that it will change its name to '''Qisda'''.[http://www.digitimes.com/displays/a20070620PD215.html]

== Company ==

BenQ manufactures technology products, including communication and personal computer related products. Its principal products include [[TFT LCD]] monitors and televisions, [[scanners]] and [[Computer printer|printers]], projectors, [[laptop]]s, [[computer keyboard]]s, [[mouse (computing)|mice]], and [[mobile phone]]s.

The head office is located in [[Taoyuan]], [[Taiwan]], and the company operates worldwide. BenQ owns and operates branch offices in key markets, and employ over 15,000+ individuals. Three business groups manage BenQ's product lines: Mobile Communications Business Group, Digital Media Business Group and Integrated Manufacturing and Services Business Group.  

BenQ Corp. has various manufacturing facilities around the World.  They include facilities in [[Taiwan]], [[People's Republic of China]], [[Mexico]], [[Czech Republic]] ([[Brno]]) and [[Brazil]] ([[Manaus]]).

== Recent developments ==

On [[October 1]], [[2005]], BenQ acquired the mobile devices division of [[Germany]]'s [[Siemens AG]], becoming the 6th largest company in the mobile phone industry by accumulated market share.  The acquisition results in a new business group, [[BenQ-Siemens]], of BenQ Corporation entirely dedicated to wireless communications. Mobile phones of the new group are marketed under a new brand, BenQ-Siemens.

On [[August 24]], [[2006]] BenQ announced plans to spin-off its manufacturing operations in early 2007, separating contract manufacturing and own-brand divisions.      

In late September 2006, the mobile devices division of BenQ, BenQ Mobile ([[Germany]]), announced bankruptcy when BenQ Corp. discontinued its funding.  As a result, BenQ Mobile was effectively placed under the supervision of a state-appointed bankruptcy administrator.   In February 2007, BenQ Mobile was finally disbanded as a suitable buyer could not be found.  An estimated 2000 BenQ Mobile employees lost their jobs. 

On August 2006, the company signed a sponsorship contract with the Spanish football club [[Real Madrid]], merging with the existent [[Siemens]] logo.
