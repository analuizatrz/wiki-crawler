The '''Calgary Flames''' are a [[professional]] men's [[ice hockey]] team based in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]].  They are members of the [[Northwest Division (NHL)|Northwest Division]] of the [[Western Conference (NHL)|Western Conference]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL). The club is the third major-professional ice hockey team to represent the city of Calgary, following the [[Calgary Tigers]] (1921–26) and [[Calgary Cowboys]] (1975–77).

The Flames arrived in the city of Calgary in 1980 after spending their first eight seasons in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], as the [[Atlanta Flames]]. The Flames spent their first three seasons, during which they lost only 32 home games,<ref>{{cite book |title=2006–07 Calgary Flames Media Guide |publisher=Calgary Flames |pages=pg. 4}}</ref> playing in the [[Stampede Corral]] before moving into their current home arena, the [[Pengrowth Saddledome|Olympic Saddledome]], in [[1983-84 Calgary Flames season|1983]]. In [[1985-86 Calgary Flames season|1986]], the Flames became the first Calgary team since the Tigers in [[1923-24 WCHL season|1924]] to compete for the [[Stanley Cup]].  In [[1988-89 Calgary Flames season|1989]], the Flames captured the Cup for the first time. 

Calgary is one of two NHL franchises in Alberta, with the other being the [[Edmonton Oilers]]. The cities' proximity has led to a famous rivalry, known as the [[Battle of Alberta]]. Games between the teams are always heated events.<ref>{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Francis |author= |title=The uncivil war...Edmonton...April 23, 1988...Oilers 4 Flames 2 |url=http://www.slam.ca/Slam030917/col_francis-sun.html |publisher=[[Calgary Sun]] |date=2003-09-17 |accessdate=2006-11-28 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Francis |author= |title=The uncivil war...Calgary...January 20, 2003...Flames 3 Oilers 2 |url=http://fun.canoe.ca/Slam030921/col_francis-sun.html |publisher=[[Calgary Sun]] |date=2003-09-21 |accessdate=2006-11-28 }}</ref> 
==Franchise history==
===Atlanta years (1972–1980)===
{{main|Atlanta Flames}}

The Flames were the result of the NHL's first pre-emptive strike against the upstart [[World Hockey Association]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Boer |first=Peter |authorlink= |title=The Calgary Flames |year=2006 |pages=12 |publisher=Overtime Books |isbn=1-897277-07-5 }}</ref>  In December [[1971-72 NHL season|1971]], the NHL hastily granted a team to [[Long Island]] &mdash; the [[New York Islanders]] &mdash; in order to keep the WHA's [[New York Raiders]] out of the brand new [[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum]]. Needing another team to balance the schedule, the NHL awarded a team to an [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]]-based group that owned the [[National Basketball Association]]'s [[Atlanta Hawks]], headed by prominent local real estate developer [[Tom Cousins]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nhl/nyi/nylsanders.html|title=History of the New York Islanders|work=Sports E-Cyclopedia|publisher=Tank Productions|accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref> Cousins named the team the "Flames" after the [[fire]] resulting from the [[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]] in the [[American Civil War]] by [[General William Tecumseh Sherman]], in which Atlanta was nearly destroyed.<ref name="atlflames">{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nhl/atlflames/aflames.html|title=History of the Atlanta Flames|work=Sports E-Cyclopedia|publisher=Tank Productions|accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref>

[[Image:AtlantaFlamesFlamingA.PNG|left|thumb|125px|Logo of the [[Atlanta Flames]].  Calgary uses the Flaming-A logo to identify [[captain (ice hockey)|alternate captains]].]]
The Flames were relatively successful early on.  Under head coaches [[Bernie Geoffrion|Bernie “Boom Boom” Geoffrion]], [[Fred Creighton]] and [[Al MacNeil]], the Flames made the playoffs in six of eight seasons in Atlanta. In marked contrast, their expansion cousins, the Islanders, compiled two of the worst seasons in NHL history during their first two years in the league.  This relative success would not translate in the playoffs, however, as the Flames won only two post-season games during their time in Atlanta.<ref>''2006–07 Calgary Flames Media Guide'', pg. 219</ref>

Despite the on-ice success, the Atlanta ownership was never on sound financial footing. Part of the reason was that the Flames' home arena, [[The Omni]], was one of the last arenas to be built without revenue-producing luxury boxes.  Also, Cousins' initial calculations did not account for the WHA entering the picture.<ref name="fletcher">{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/hockeyu/halloffame/fletcher110304.html |title=Building a franchise is Flether's forte |accessdate=2006-11-28 |last=McGourty |first=John |date=2004-11-03 |publisher=nhl.com}}</ref>  The Flames were also victims of their own early success, which resulted in several low draft picks. At the same time, the Islanders used high draft picks resulting from their first two wretched seasons to put together the core of a team that would win four [[Stanley Cups]] in a row in the early [[1980s]].

In 1980, Cousins was in considerable financial difficulty and was forced to sell the Flames to stave off bankruptcy. With few serious offers from local groups, he sold the Flames to a group of Calgary businessmen fronted by Canadian entrepreneur, and former owner of the Oilers, [[Nelson Skalbania]].<ref name="atlflames">{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nhl/atlflames/aflames.html|title=History of the Atlanta Flames|work=Sports E-Cyclopedia|publisher=Tank Productions|accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref>  The price of US$16 million was the highest price paid for an NHL franchise at the time. Skalbania promptly moved the team to Calgary, but kept the Flames name because he thought it would be appropriate for an oil town like Calgary. The flaming "A" logo was replaced by a flaming "C".  Skalbania sold his interest in 1981, and the Flames have been locally owned since.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oilersheritage.com/legacy/contributions_owners_nelsonskalbania2.html|title=Nelson Skalbania|work=Edmonton Oilers Heritage|accessdate=2007-06-18}}</ref>

===Early years in Calgary (1980–1985)===
[[Image:PengrowthSaddledomeNight.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The Flames moved into the [[Pengrowth Saddledome|Olympic Saddledome]] in 1983.]]
Led by [[Kent Nilsson]]'s 49-goal, 131-point season, the Flames stormed into the playoffs in their first season in Calgary with a 39-27-4 record, good for third in the [[Patrick Division]]. The team found much greater playoff success in Calgary than it did in Atlanta, winning their first two playoff series over the [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]] and [[Philadelphia Flyers]] before bowing out to the [[Minnesota North Stars]] in the semi-finals.<ref>''2006–07 Calgary Flames Media Guide, pg. 131</ref>  This early success was not soon repeated. After a losing record in [[1981-82 NHL season|1981–82]], General Manager [[Cliff Fletcher]] jettisoned several former Atlanta players and rebuilt the roster.<ref>Boer, pg. 51</ref> Over the next three seasons, he put together a core of players that would remain together through the early [[1990s]]. His efforts to match the Oilers led him to draw talent from areas previously neglected by the NHL. The Flames were among the earliest teams to sign large numbers of U.S. college players, including [[Joel Otto]], [[Gary Suter]], and [[Colin Patterson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://couchpotatohockey.com/Teams/Team%20Biographies/Calgary.asp|title=Calgary Flames Team Biography|publisher=Couchpotatohockey|accessdate=2007-12-07}}</ref> Fletcher also stepped up the search for European hockey talent, acquiring [[Håkan Loob]] and other key players. He was among the first to [[NHL Entry Draft|draft]] players from the [[Soviet Union]], including [[HC CSKA Moscow]] star [[Sergei Makarov]], but Soviet players were not released to Western teams until 1989.<ref name="soviet">{{cite web |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/news/2002/09/27/soviet_legacy/ |title=Sweeping changes |author=Dolezar, John A. |date=2002-09-27 |accessdate=2007-12-07 |publisher=Sports Illustrated}}</ref>  Still, the team was sufficiently improved to challenge the Oilers, who required the maximum seven games to defeat the Flames en route to their [[1983-84 NHL season|1984]] [[Stanley Cup]] Championship.

===Seasons of growth (1985–1988)===
[[Image:Calgary Flames logo 1980-1994.png|125px|left|thumb|The original Flames logo, used from 1980–94. A black outline was added in 1995.]]
The Flames improved to become one of the NHL's top teams during the mid-[[1980s]] and early [[1990s]]. They failed to earn 90 points in the regular season only once between 1984 and 1991, but were often unable to transfer that success into a deep playoff run. The NHL's playoff structure of the time made it very likely that the Flames would meet the Oilers in either the first or second round, rather than in the conference finals. Many observers thought that during the mid-1980s, the Oilers and Flames were far and away the two best teams in the Campbell Conference, and possibly the two best teams in the league.  For example, the Flames had their first 100-point season in [[1987-88 NHL season|1987–88]], earning the [[Presidents' Trophy]] for having the league's best record, and ended the Oilers' six-year reign atop the Smythe Division in the process.  However, they were swept by the Oilers in the second round of the playoffs.  The two teams' bitter rivalry mirrored the longstanding rivalry between their two cities. 

By [[1985-86 NHL season|1986]] the Flames had landed forwards [[Doug Risebrough]], [[Lanny McDonald]], and [[Dan Quinn]], defenceman [[Al MacInnis]], and goalie [[Mike Vernon (ice hockey)|Mike Vernon]]. After sweeping the [[Winnipeg Jets]] in the first round, the Flames went on to upset the Oilers in the second round in seven games.  The series-winning goal came at the hands of Oilers' rookie [[James Stephen Smith|Steve Smith]] as he accidentally shot the puck off of goaltender [[Grant Fuhr]]'s leg and into his own net.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oilersheritage.com/history/dynasty_players_stevesmith.html  |title=Dynasty Players: Steve Smith |accessdate=2007-12-07 |publisher=Edmonton Oilers Heritage}}</ref> The goal remains one of the most legendary blunders in hockey history.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/nhl/features/si_stanley_cup/1986/ |title=SI Flashback: Stanley Cup 1986 |author=Swift, E.M.|accessdate=2007-12-07 |publisher=Sports Illustrated}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/stanleycup2006/content/features/topgame7.html |title=Top 10: Game 7's |accessdate=2007-12-07 |publisher=cbc.ca}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/chokes/hockey.html |title=Biggest Stanley Cup playoff chokes |accessdate=2007-12-07 |publisher=ESPN}}</ref>

From there, the Flames went on to defeat the [[St. Louis Blues (hockey)|St. Louis Blues]] in another seven-game series.  This time, Calgary had to survive a scare of its own, shaking off the [[The Monday Night Miracle (ice hockey)|Monday Night Miracle]] at the [[St. Louis Arena]].  [[Doug Wickenheiser]] scored in overtime to cap off a comeback from 5-2 down with 10 minutes to play in the third period in game six, forcing the Flames to a seventh game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/special/pd125.nsf/0/8562839B99EBB29186256E0700728192?OpenDocument |title=Birth of the Blues |author=Goold, Derrick |date=2004-1-20 |accessdate=2007-12-07 |publisher=St. Louis Post Dispatch}}</ref>  Calgary would win game seven at home, 2–1, advancing into the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time.  In the finals, the Flames proved to be no match for the [[Montreal Canadiens]], losing in five games.  Montreal [[rookie]] goaltender [[Patrick Roy]] was nearly unstoppable in the last two games, allowing only four goals en route to winning the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]].  

The Flames followed up their run to the finals with their best regular seasons in team history.  Calgary's 46-31-3 record in [[1986-87 NHL season|1986–87]] was good for third overall in the NHL.<ref>''2006–07 Calgary Flames Media Guide'', pg 125</ref> Calgary was unable to duplicate its playoff success, however, losing its first-round match-up with the Jets in six games.  The season was also difficult off the ice, as [[1986 NHL Entry Draft|1986]] first-round draft pick [[George Pelawa]] was killed in a car accident prior to the season's start.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.canoe.ca/Slam031008/col_ulmer-sun.html |title=Heat is on |author=Ulmer, Mike |date=2003-10-08 |accessdate=2007-12-07 |publisher=Toronto Sun}}</ref>  Back on the ice, the Flames improved again in [[1987-88 NHL season|1987–88]], finishing atop the league standings with a 48-23-9 record, capturing the franchise's first [[Presidents' Trophy]].<ref>''2006–07 Calgary Flames Media Guide'', pg. 124</ref> [[Joe Nieuwendyk]] became the second rookie in league history to score 50+ goals, earning him the [[Calder Memorial Trophy]] as rookie of the year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=11194 |title=Joe Nieuwendyk player profile |accessdate=2007-12-07 |publisher=legendsofhockey.net}}</ref>  Looking to bolster the line-up for a playoff run, the Flames dealt young sniper [[Brett Hull]], along with [[Steve Bozek]], to the Blues for [[Rob Ramage]] and [[Rick Wamsley]] on [[March 7]], [[1988]].  The Flames playoff frustration would continue, however: after defeating the [[Los Angeles Kings]] in five games, Calgary was swept out of the playoffs in four straight by the Oilers.

===Stanley Cup (1988–1989)===
[[Image:FlamesBanners.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Calgary's [[1988-89 Calgary Flames season|1988–89 Championship]] banner hangs alongside [[Lanny McDonald]]'s retired jersey.]]
In [[1988-89 NHL season|1988–89]], the Flames continued to improve.  They captured their second consecutive Presidents' Trophy with a franchise record 117 points, finishing 26 points better than the 2nd-place Kings in the Smythe Division.<ref>''2006–07 Calgary Flames Media Guide'', pg. 123</ref>  Fletcher continued to tinker with the roster, acquiring [[Doug Gilmour]] as part of a six-player deal at the trade deadline.

In the playoffs, the Flames were stretched to seven games in the first round by the Canucks, relying on several key saves by goaltender [[Mike Vernon (ice hockey)|Mike Vernon]], including a famous glove save off a [[Stan Smyl]] breakaway in overtime.  The save remains a defining moment in Flames history.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam040416/nhl_calvan8-sun.html |title=Smyl doesn't lose sleep over big save |author=Sportak, Randy |date=2004-04-16 |accessdate=2007-12-07 |publisher=Calgary Sun}}</ref>  

After defeating the Canucks, the Flames made short work of the Kings, defeating them in four straight, before defeating the [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]] in five to set up a rematch of the [[1986 Stanley Cup Finals]] against Montreal.  This time, the Flames won in six games, the last being a 4-2 win in Montreal. This victory was especially significant in that it marked the only time that an opposing team defeated the Canadiens to win the Stanley Cup on [[Montreal Forum]] ice.<ref name="lanny">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/hockeyu/history/cup/mcdonald052301.html |title=Lanny, Stanley into the sunset |date=2001-05-23 |publisher=NHL.com |accessdate=2007-12-07}}</ref> Long-time captain Lanny McDonald retired at the end of the season.

In 1989, thanks in part to Cliff Fletcher's diplomatic efforts, the Soviets finally gave permission for a select group of Soviet hockey players to sign with NHL teams. The first of these players was [[Sergei Pryakhin]]. Although Pryakhin never became an NHL regular, his arrival blazed a trail for the large number of Russian players who entered the NHL beginning in [[1989-90 NHL season|1989–90]].<ref name="soviet" /> Sergei Makarov joined the Flames that season and, though already in his thirties, became the fifth Flame to win the [[Calder Memorial Trophy]] as the league's Rookie of the Year. The selection would prove controversial, prompting the league to amend the rules to exclude any player over the age of 26 from future consideration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE4DA103EF933A15755C0A966958260 |title=New Rules for Rookies |date=1990-06-20 |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=2007-06-10}}</ref>

===After the Cup (1990–2003)===
[[Image:Calgary Flames horse head logo.png|right|thumb|125px|Calgary's alternate logo, 1999–2007]]
In 1991, after 18 years at the head of the organization, Fletcher left the Flames to become the general manager of the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] .<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/html/spot_oneononeb200401.htm |title=One on One with Cliff Fletcher |publisher=legendsofhockey.net |accessdate=2007-05-14}}</ref>  He was succeeded in Calgary by Doug Risebrough, and the two quickly completed a ten-player mega-trade that saw disgruntled forward [[Doug Gilmour]] dealt to Toronto with four other players for former 50-goal scorer [[Gary Leeman]] and four others.<ref name="gilmourtrade">{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/nhl/news/2001/08/08/sayitaintso_flames/ |title=Say it aint so: Calgary Flames |publisher=Sports Illustrated |author=Dolezar, John A |date=2001-08-08 |accessdate=2007-05-14}}</ref>  The trade transformed both clubs.  The formerly-inept Leafs turned into a contender almost immediately, while the deal is widely believed to have been the beginning of the Flames' long decline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2003/03/13/leafs_flames030313.html |title=Gilmour begins again with Leafs in Calgary |publisher=CBC Sports |date=2003-04-13 |accessdate=2007-05-14}}</ref>  Despite the blossoming of [[Theoren Fleury]] into an NHL star, the Flames missed the playoffs entirely in [[1991-92 NHL season|1992]], only a year after finishing with their third 100-point season in franchise history.  It was the first time the Flames had missed the playoffs since [[1974-75 NHL season|1975]], when they were still in Atlanta.  It was also only the third time out of the playoffs for the franchise.

[[Image:JaromeIginla.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Jarome Iginla]] was one of the team's few bright spots during its seven-year playoff drought]]
Calgary rebounded to make the playoffs for the next three seasons, including two consecutive division titles. However, they failed move past the first round of the playoffs each time.  In [[1996-97 NHL season|1997]], a year after winning their second-consecutive division title, the Flames missed the playoffs and would not return for seven years. 

During this time, the Flames found it increasingly difficult to hold onto their best players, as salaries escalated while the [[Canadian Dollar]] lost value against the [[United States|American Dollar]].<ref name="usatoday">{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/cup/2004-05-25-flames-cover_x.htm  |title=Flames: Bright spot for Canada |publisher=USA Today |author=Gardiner, Andy |date=2004-05-24 |accessdate=2007-12-07}}</ref>  The NHL's small-market Canadian teams found it increasingly difficult to compete in the new environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/columns/story?columnist=cox_damien&id=3098820 |title=What is Ottawa's success worth to Canadians, NHL? A lot |publisher=EPSN |author=Cox, Damien |date=2007-11-07 |accessdate=2007-12-06}}</ref>  In 2000, the Flames owners launched their "Flames Forever" campaign.  The owners argued that if the trend of declining interest in the team was not reversed, the team could join its departed counterparts from [[Winnipeg Jets|Winnipeg]] and [[Quebec Nordiques|Quebec City]] in relocating to the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2000/05/18/flames00518.html |title=Flames aim to save team by end of June |publisher=CBC Sports |date=2000-05-18 |accessdate=2007-12-06}}</ref>  The campaign, aimed at increasing season ticket sales from a franchise low of 8,700 to 14,000, proved successful.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2000/06/29/flames000629.html |title=Flames reach season ticket goal |publisher=CBC Sports |date=2000-11-10 |accessdate=2007-12-06}}</ref>  The increased sales did not halt the Flames' financial losses, however, as the team estimated it lost $14.5 million between 2001 and 2003.<ref name="usatoday" />

In [[1998-99 NHL season|1999]], the Flames traded Fleury rather than lose him to free agency.  The deal occurred only a few days after he became the franchise's all-time leading scorer.  One of the few bright spots in this stretch was [[Jarome Iginla]]. Iginla, who made his NHL debut in the Flames last playoff games in 1996, captured the [[Rocket Richard Trophy|Rocket Richard]] and [[Art Ross Trophy|Art Ross]] Trophies in [[2001-02 Calgary Flames season|2001–02]] as NHL goal- and point-scoring champion after scoring 52 goals and 96 points. Iginla again won the Rocket Richard Trophy, tied with [[Rick Nash]] and [[Ilya Kovalchuk]], with 41 goals in [[2003-04 NHL season|2003–04]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php3?pid=14470 |title=Jarome Iginla |accessdate=2007-12-07 |publisher=hockeydb.com}}</ref>  Another bright spot for the team during this time was defenceman [[Robyn Regehr]], who became the youngest nominee ever for the [[Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy]], which recognizes perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey, in [[1999-2000 NHL season|his rookie year]], despite suffering two broken legs in a car accident the previous summer.<ref>''2006–07 Calgary Flames Media Guide'', pg. 61</ref>

===2004 playoff run===
{{main|2003-04 Calgary Flames season}}
After seven consecutive seasons out of the playoffs, the Flames finally returned to the post-season in 2004.  The Flames stunned the hockey world by defeating the three Western Conference division champions to become the first Canadian team in a decade to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2004/05/19/sharks_flames040519.html |title=Flames reach Stanley Cup finals |accessdate=2006-11-28 |date=2004-05-20 |publisher=cbc.ca}}</ref> The 
Flames' first victim was the Northwest Division champion Vancouver Canucks, whom they defeated in seven games. It was the Flames' first playoff series win since they won the 1989 final.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/recap?gid=2004041922 |title=Recap: Calgary 3, Vancouver 2, OT |accessdate=2006-11-28 |date=2004-04-20 |publisher=Yahoo! Sports}}</ref>

The Flames then upset the [[Detroit Red Wings]], who had garnered the league's best record, in six games. After eliminating the Pacific Division champs, the [[San Jose Sharks]], in six games in the Western Conference Final, the Flames earned a trip to the [[2004 Stanley Cup Finals]] to face the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]]. The Canadian Embassy in [[Washington, D.C.]], flew the Flames flag beside the [[Flag of Canada|Maple Leaf]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/viewpoint/vp_hwang/20040528.html |title=Cheering for the home team |accessdate=2006-11-28 |date=2004-05-28 |last=Hwang |first=Rosa |publisher=cbc.ca}}</ref>  while [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Paul Martin]] dubbed the Flames "Canada's team."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://calgary-flames-news.newslib.com/story/981-245220/ |title=Martin dubs Calgary Flames 'Canada's Team' |accessdate=2006-12-23 |date=2004-05-30 |publisher=CTV Sports}}</ref>

The final series went to seven games, with the Flames suffering a controversial non-goal in game six at home.  Replays showed that [[Martin Gelinas]] came close to scoring what would have been the go-ahead goal late in the third period; however, the referees never signaled a goal, and later replays were ruled inconclusive.  The Lightning would go on to win the game in [[overtime (hockey)|double overtime]],<ref>{{cite news |first=Damian |last=Cristodero |title= One last shot |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2004/06/06/Lightning/One_last_shot.shtml |publisher=St. Petersberg Times |date=2004-06-06 |accessdate=2006-11-28}}</ref> before winning game seven at home to capture the Stanley Cup.

The Flames roared through the [[2005-06 NHL season|2005–06 season]], finishing with 103 points. It was their best total since the 1989 Cup-winning season, and good enough to capture their first division title in 12 years. However, the Flames lost to the [[Anaheim Ducks|Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]] in seven games during the first round of the playoffs. Star goaltender [[Miikka Kiprusoff]] captured both the [[Vezina Trophy]] and the [[William M. Jennings Trophy]] as the NHL's top goaltender, while rookie defenceman [[Dion Phaneuf]] set a franchise record for goals by a rookie blue-liner with 20.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/news/2006/05/271296.html |title=Avs send Tanguay to Flames for Leopold, picks |accessdate=2007-12-23 |date=2006-06-24 |publisher=ESPN}}</ref>

The 2006 off-season began with an unexpected trade for [[Alex Tanguay]], formerly of the [[Colorado Avalanche]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/draft2006/news/story?id=2499645 |title=NHL announces 2005–06 trophy finalists |accessdate=2006-11-28 |date=2006-05-04 |publisher=nhl.com}}</ref> and with [[Darryl Sutter]] relinquishing his head coaching position to assistant [[Jim Playfair]] to focus on his duties as general manager.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=171090&hubname=nhl |title=Sutter steps down as Flames coach |accessdate=2006-11-28 |author=Canadian Press |publisher=tsn.ca}}</ref> Despite the changes, and a marked improvement in team offence, the Flames managed only an 8th-place finish in the Western Conference with 96 points. In the playoffs, Calgary fell in six games to the top-seeded [[Detroit Red Wings]] in the first round.  During the series, the Flames were fined by the NHL for incidents of [[violence in ice hockey|violence]].  Notably, backup goaltender [[Jamie McLennan]] was suspended five games for slashing Red Wings forward [[Johan Franzen]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globesports.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070422.wmclennan0422/GSStory/GlobeSportsHockey/home |title=Five-game suspension for McLennan |author=Duhatschek, Eric |date=2007-04-22 |accessdate=2007-12-07 |publisher=The Globe and Mail}}</ref>

Prior to the start of the [[2007-08 NHL season|2007–08 season]], the Flames demoted Playfair to associate coach, bringing in [[Mike Keenan]] as the team's third head coach in three years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=210816&hubname= |title=Flames name Keenan new head coach |date=2007-06-14 |accessdate=2007-12-07 |publisher=TSN}}</ref>  During the season, Jarome Iginla became the Flames' all-time leader in games played, passing Al MacInnis' mark of 803.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/news?slug=txflamesiginla&prov=st&type=lgns |title=Iginla sets franchise games record |date=2007-11-30 |accessdate=2007-12-07 |publisher=Yahoo!}}</ref>

==Community impact==
===Flames Foundation===
The Flames have maintained an active presence in the community since their arrival in Calgary.  Through the team's non-profit charity, the ''Flames Foundation'', the team has donated over $29 million to causes throughout southern Alberta.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://flames.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&page=NHLPage&bcid=com_ffcr |title=Community |accessdate=2007-12-07 |publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club}}</ref>  Along with the [[Rotary International|Rotary Club]], the Flames are helping to fund the first children's [[hospice]] in Alberta, and one of only six in North America.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/calgary/story/2007/05/09/hospice-alberta.html |title=Alberta to get first children's hospice |date=2007-05-09 |accessdate=2007-12-07 |publisher=CBC}}</ref>

The Flames are also close partners with the [[Alberta Children's Hospital]].  Among the many activities the Flames participate in, the ''Wheelchair Hockey Challenge'' with the Townsend Tigers has remained a highly-popular tradition for both the players and the children involved.  In 2007, the Tigers defeated the Flames 10–9, to move to a perfect 26-0 record since the challenge was first instituted in 1981.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://flames.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&page=NewsPage&articleid=344100 |title=Townsend Tigers extend winning streak to 26 |date=2007-11-21 |accessdate=2007-12-07 |publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club}}</ref>

===Red Mile===
{{main|Red Mile}}

During the Flames' run to the Stanley Cup Finals of 2004, the city of Calgary essentially became the host of a "non-stop party". The 17th Avenue SW entertainment district, which runs west from the Pengrowth Saddledome, saw as many as 35,000 fans pack the streets during the first three rounds of the playoffs,<ref name="usatoday" /> and over 60,000 in the finals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://calgary.ctv.ca/servlet/RTGAMArticleHTMLTemplate/A/20040604/flameswingame5?brand=generic&hub=&tf=CFCNPlus/generic/hubs/frontpage.html&cf=CFCNPlus/generic/hubs/frontpage.cfg&slug=flameswingame5&date=20040604&archive=CFCNPlus&ad_page_name=&nav=home&subnav=fullstory |title=Police brace for another big night on the Red Mile|publisher=CTV|date=2004-06-04|accessdate=2007-12-06}}</ref> Similar celebrations had occurred during Flames playoff runs in the 1980s, primarily taking place along 11th Ave SW, then known as "Electric Avenue".

The Red Mile party received widespread coverage in newspapers across North America.<ref>{{cite web

[[Image:Cofred.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The C of Red]]
In April 2006, the [[Calgary Police Service]] announced that Red Mile gatherings would not be encouraged, and that measures would be taken to discourage them, including traffic diversions, a zero-tolerance policy on noise and rowdy behaviour, and the presence of plain-clothed officers among the crowd to ticket offenders.<ref>{{cite web|last=Seskus|first=Tony|coauthors=Sean Myers|url=http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/story.html?id=3ff860fa-18ea-4297-b0f2-f509d7021af9&k=59310 |title=The party's over for the Red Mile|publisher=[[Calgary Herald]]|date=2006-04-11|accessdate=2007-12-07}}</ref> After meeting with the Chief of Police, Mayor [[Dave Bronconnier]] convinced the Calgary Police Service to relax their ban on the "Red Mile" and encouraged people to make their way to 17th Ave, however the police retained their zero-tolerance policy on public nudity and drunkenness.<ref name="RedMileSun" />

===The "C of Red"===
During the Flames' run to the Stanley Cup Finals of 2004, most of the Flames fans attending the hockey games at the Saddledome wore a red jersey with Calgary's flaming C on it.<ref name="usatoday" /> Sales of the Flames red home jersey, introduced at the start of the 2003–04 campaign, were so strong during the playoffs that the team set a league record for sales of a new jersey design.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fisher|first=Scott|url=http://www.canoe.ca/Slam040521/nhl_calsj5-sun.html |title=Red-hot jersey breaks record|publisher=[[Calgary Sun]]|date=2004-05-21|accessdate=2007-12-06}}</ref>  The tradition of the C of Red dates back to the 1986 Stanley Cup playoffs against the Oilers. Oiler fans were donning hats promoting "Hat Trick Fever" in their quest for [[three-peat|three straight Stanley Cups]]. Flames fans countered by wearing red. In the 1987 playoffs against the [[Winnipeg Jets]], the Jets responded to the C of Red by encouraging fans to wear white, creating the [[Winnipeg White Out]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2007/09/06/nhl_wants_trademark_white_out.aspx |title=NHL wants trademark 'White Out' faded out |date=2007-05-09 |author=Boyer, Lauren |accessdate=2007-09-06 |publisher=The Daily Collegian}}</ref>

==Team colours and mascot==
===Logo===
[[Image:9091Flames sm.gif|right|thumb|150px|Original jerseys, used 1980–1994]]
The Flames primary logo is the "Flaming C" design, introduced when the team came to Calgary in [[1980]].  The design of the logo has remained constant since it was created, though the Flames use a different-coloured logo for the home and away jerseys.  From 1980 until [[2000]], the home logo was red on a white background, while the road logo was white on a red background.  In [[2003]], the NHL switched to using coloured jerseys for the home team. The home logo became black, with the road logo red on a white background.  The original "Flaming A" logo of the Atlanta Flames has been restored for use as a patch denoting the team's assistant captains.  The flaming horse logo was retired in 2007 with the introduction of the new [[Reebok]] Edge jerseys.<ref name="RbkEdge">{{cite web |url=http://flames.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&page=NewsPage&articleid=336594 |title=Flames unveil new look Rbk Edge uniform |date=2007-09-04 |accessdate=2007-12-07 |publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club}}</ref>

===Jerseys===
[[Image:9596Flames sm.gif|left|thumb|150px|Second design, used 1994–2000]]
The Flames' original jerseys used red and orange striping.  In 1994, the Flames added black to the team's colour scheme, while also adding a diagonal stripe from the base of the jersey to below the logo.  In 1998, to celebrate the "Year of the Cowboy", the Flames introduced their third jersey design, the "flaming horse" logo on a black background.<ref>''2006-07 Calgary Flames Media Guide'', pg. 4</ref>  Two years later, the jersey became the Flames road jersey, while the home jersey was updated to incorporate the same V-style striping on the arms and waist of the jersey.  This jersey was once again relegated to third-jersey status in 2003 when the NHL adopted the coloured jerseys for the home team.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statenews.com/index.php/article/2003/01/nhl_039quacked039_up |title=NHL 'quacked' up with hockey jersey switch |author=Karol, Kristofer |accessdate=2007-12-07 |publisher=statenews.com}}</ref>  In 2007, with the introduction of the Rbk Edge jersey, the Flames updated their look once again, replacing the horizontal striping with vertical striping down the sides.  To honour the team's heritage, the Flames added the flags of Alberta and Canada as shoulder patches.<ref name="RbkEdge" />

===Mascot===
{{main|Harvey the Hound}}
[[Harvey the Hound]] is the Flames' mascot. He was created in 1983 to serve both with the Flames and the [[Calgary Stampeders]] of the [[Canadian Football League]].<ref name="cbcmascots"/> Harvey was the first mascot in the NHL.<ref name="cbcmascots">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/columns/top10/mascots.html|title=Mascot Madness|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]|accessdate=2007-02-24|date}}</ref>  Harvey is famous for an incident in January 2003 where he had his tongue ripped out by [[Edmonton Oilers]] head coach [[Craig MacTavish]] as he was harassing their bench.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pyette|first=Ryan|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam030123/col_pyette-sun.html |title=MacTavish leaves Harvey the Hound speechless|publisher=[[London Free Press]]|date=2003-01-23|accessdate=2007-12-23}}</ref>  The incident made headlines throughout North America and led to much humour, including having many other NHL team mascots arrive at the [[53rd National Hockey League All-Star Game|2003 All-Star Game]] with their tongues hanging out.<ref>{{cite web|last=Francis|first=Eric|url=http://www.slamsports.com/Slam030921/col_francis-sun.html |title=The uncivil war|publisher=[[Calgary Sun]]|date=2003-09-21|accessdate=2007-12-23}}</ref>

===Honoured members===
{{seealso|Calgary Flames notable players and award winners}}

Several members of the Flames organization have been honoured by the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] during the team's 27-year history in Calgary.  [[Lanny McDonald]] was the first Flame player inducted, gaining election in 1992.  McDonald recorded 215 goals in 492 games for the Flames, including a team record 66 goals in [[1982-83 NHL season|1982–83]].  He was joined in 2000 by a fellow member of the 1989 [[Stanley Cup]] championship team, [[Joe Mullen]].  Mullen spent five seasons with the Flames, recording 388 points and capturing two [[Lady Byng Trophy|Lady Byng Trophies]].  [[Grant Fuhr]], elected in 2003, became the third former Flames player to enter the Hall.  Fuhr played only one season in Calgary; however, he recorded his 400th career win in a Flames uniform, a victory over the [[Florida Panthers]] on [[October 22]], [[1999]].<ref name="hhof">''2006–07 Calgary Flames Media Guide'', pts. 20–21</ref>  In 2007, [[Al MacInnis]] became the fourth former Flame inducted into the Hall.  MacInnis was a member of the Flames from 1981 until 1994.  He is best remembered for his booming slapshot, as well as for winning the Conn Smythe Trophy in 1989 as playoff MVP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/halloffame07/bio?page=nhlhall07/macinnis |title=2007 Hockey Hall of Fame—Al MacInnis bio |author=Burnside, Scott |date=2007-11-09 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2007-12-07}}</ref>

Former head coach "Badger" [[Bob Johnson (ice hockey)|Bob Johnson]] joined McDonald in the class of 1992, gaining election as a builder. Johnson coached five seasons with the Flames from 1982–87, and his 193 wins remain a team record.  [[Cliff Fletcher]] was the Flames general manager from the organizations inception in 1972 until 1991 - a span of 19 years.  During that time, the Flames qualified for the playoffs sixteen consecutive times between 1976 and 1991. Fletcher was inducted in 2004.  In 2006, [[Harley Hotchkiss]] became the third Flames builder to gain election.  Hotchkiss is an original member of the ownership group that purchased and brought the Flames to Calgary in 1980. He has served many years as the chairman of the NHL Board of Directors, during which he played a significant role in the resolution of the [[2004-05 NHL lockout|2004–05 lockout]].<ref name="hhof" />
