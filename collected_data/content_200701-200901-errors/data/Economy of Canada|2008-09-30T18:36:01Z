[[Canada]] is the home to the ninth largest economy in the world<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_future_GDP_estimates_(nominal)|title=2006/2007/2008 GDP|publisher=IMF}}</ref> (measured in US dollars at market exchange rates),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DATASTATISTICS/Resources/GDP.pdf|title=2006 GDP figures|publisher=world bank}}</ref> is one of the world's wealthiest nations, and a member of the [[Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and [[G8|Group of Eight]] (G8). As with other developed nations, the Canadian economy is dominated by the [[Tertiary sector of industry|service industry]], which employs about three quarters of Canadians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/labr68a.htm|title=Actual hours worked per week by industry, seasonally adjusted (monthly) |publisher=Statistics Canada}}</ref> Canada is unusual among developed countries in the importance of the [[Primary sector of industry|primary sector]], with the [[logging]] and [[petroleum|oil]] industries being two of Canada's most important. Canada also has a sizable manufacturing sector, centred in Central Canada, with the [[Automaker|automobile industry]] especially important.

[[International trade]] makes up a large part of the Canadian economy, particularly of its natural resources. The United States is by far its largest trading partner, accounting for about 76% of exports and 65% of imports as of 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/gblec02a.htm|title=Imports, exports and trade balance of goods on a balance-of-payments basis, by country or country grouping |publisher=Statistics Canada}}</ref> Canada's combined exports and imports ranked 8th among all nations in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Top_20_Exporters_and_Importers_in_2006.gif|title=2006 exports/imports}}</ref>

Canada is a [[Mixed economy|mixed market]] or [[social market economy]],<ref name="PBS, commanding heights, map of the world's economic systems">{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/hi/timemap/ti.html|title=PBS, commanding heights, map of the world's economic systems|accessdate=2008-01-31}}</ref> which the [[Heritage Foundation]] ranks as 7th in the world on their "index of economic freedom", higher than most western European countries and slightly lower than the U.S. (in 5th place).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/countries.cfm|title=2008 Index of Economic Freedom |publisher=Heritage Foundation}}</ref> Canada ranks among the most developed countries on the [[Human development index]], with a GDP per capita lower than, and a median household income roughly equal to, that of the United States. 

==Economic sectors==
Canada has considerable natural resources spread across its varied regions. In [[British Columbia]], the forestry industry is of great importance, while the oil industry is important in [[Alberta]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]. [[Northern Ontario]] is home to a wide array of mines, while the [[fishing]] industry has long been central to the character of the [[Atlantic provinces]], though it has recently been in steep decline.

These industries are increasingly becoming less important to the overall economy. Only some 4% of Canadians are employed in these fields, and they account for less than 6% of GDP. {{Fact|date=September 2007}} They are still paramount in many parts of the country. Many, if not most, towns in northern Canada, where agriculture is difficult, exist because of a nearby mine or source of timber. Canada is a world leader in the production of many natural resources such as [[gold]], [[nickel]], [[uranium]], [[diamonds]] and [[lead]]. Several of Canada's largest companies are based in natural resource industries, such as [[EnCana]], [[Cameco]], [[Goldcorp]], and [[Barrick Gold]]. The vast majority of these products are exported, mainly to the United States. There are also many secondary and service industries that are directly linked to primary ones. For instance one of Canada's largest manufacturing industries is the [[pulp and paper]] sector, which is directly linked to the logging industry.

The relatively large reliance on natural resources has several effects on the Canadian economy and Canadian society. While manufacturing and service industries are easy to standardize, natural resources vary greatly by region. This ensures that differing economic structures developed in each region of Canada, contributing to Canada's strong regionalism. At the same time the vast majority of these resources are exported, integrating Canada closely into the international economy. Howlett and Ramesh argue that the inherent instability of such industries also contributes to greater government intervention in the economy, to reduce the social impact of market changes. <ref>Howlett, Michael and M. Ramesh. ''Political Economy of Canada: An Introduction.'' Toronto: McClelland and Stewart, 1992.</ref>

Such industries also raise important questions of sustainability. Despite many decades as a leading producer, there is little risk of depletion. Large discoveries continue to be made, such as the massive nickel find at [[Voisey's Bay]]. Moreover the far north remains largely undeveloped as producers await higher prices or new technologies as many operations in this region are not yet cost effective. In recent decades Canadians have become less willing to accept the environmental destruction associated with exploiting natural resources. High wages and Aboriginal land claims have also curbed expansion. Instead many Canadian companies have focused their exploration and expansion activities overseas where prices are lower and governments more accommodating. Canadian companies are increasingly playing important roles in Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Africa. 

It is the renewable resources that have raised some of the greatest concerns. After decades of escalating overexploitation the [[cod]] fishery all but collapsed in the 1990s, and the Pacific salmon industry also suffered greatly. The logging industry, after many years of activism, have in recent years moved to a more sustainable model.

===Energy===
{{see also|Petroleum production in Canada}}

[[Image:Oil well3419.jpg|thumb|0px|right|[[Nodding donkey]] pumping an oil well near [[Sarnia, Ontario]]]]Canada is one of the few developed nations that is a net exporter of energy. Most important are the large oil and gas resources centred in Alberta, but also present in neighbouring British Columbia and [[Saskatchewan]]. The vast [[Athabasca Tar Sands]] give Canada the world's second largest reserves of oil after Saudi Arabia according to USGS. In [[Quebec]] and British Columbia, as well as Ontario, Alberta and Manitoba, hydroelectric power is a cheap and relatively environmentally friendly source of abundant energy. In part because of this, Canada is also one of the world's highest per capita consumers of energy.<ref>[http://www.ec.gc.ca/soer-ree/English/Indicators/Issues/Energy/Bulletin/ec_iss_e.cfm Environment Canada - Energy Consumption]</ref><ref>[http://www.environmentalindicators.com/htdocs/indicators/8ener.htm Canada vs. The OECD: An Environmental Comparison]</ref> Cheap energy has enabled the creation of several important industries, such as the large [[aluminum]] industry in Quebec, Alberta and British Columbia.

Historically, an important issue in Canadian politics is that while [[Western Canada]] is one of the world's richest sources of energy, the industrial heartland of Southern Ontario and Quebec has fewer native sources of power. It is, however, cheaper for Alberta to ship its oil to the western United States than to eastern Canada. The eastern Canadian ports thus import significant quantities of oil from overseas, and Ontario makes significant use of [[Nuclear power in Canada|nuclear power]].

In times of high oil prices this means that the majority of Canada's population suffers, while the West benefits. The [[National Energy Policy]] of the early 1980s attempted to force Alberta to sell low priced oil to eastern Canada. This policy proved deeply divisive, and quickly lost its importance as oil prices collapsed in the mid-1980s. One of the most controversial sections of the [[Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement]] of 1988 was a promise that Canada would never charge the United States more for energy than fellow Canadians.

===Agriculture===
{{main|Agriculture in Canada}}
[[Image:Alberta modern cement grain elevator 034 cropped.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A grain elevator in Alberta]]
Canada is also one of the world's largest suppliers of agricultural products, particularly of wheat and other grains.<ref>[http://dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/Collection-R/LoPBdP/modules/prb98-2-grain/grainmarket-e.htm The Relative Position of Canada in the World Grain Market]</ref> Canada is a major exporter of agricultural products, to the United States but also to Europe and East Asia. As with all other developed nations the proportion of the population and GDP devoted to agriculture fell dramatically over the 20th century. 

As with other developed nations, the Canadian agriculture industry receives significant government subsidies and supports.  However, Canada has been a strong supporter of reducing market influencing subsidies through the [[World Trade Organization]].  In 2000, Canada spent approximately CDN$4.6 billion on supports for the industry.  Of this, $2.32 billion was classified under the WTO designation of "green box" support, meaning it did not directly influence the market, such as money for research or disaster relief.  All but $848.2 million were subsidies worth less than 5% of the value of the crops they were provided for, which is the WTO threshold.  Consequently, Canada used only $848.2 million of its $4.3 billion subsidy allowance granted by the WTO.<ref>[http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/PRBpubs/prb0536-e.htm Canada's Domestic Agricultural Supports and the World Trade Organization]</ref>

===Manufacturing===
The general pattern of development for wealthy nations was a transition from a primary industry based economy to a manufacturing based one, and then to a service based economy. Canada did not follow this pattern; manufacturing has always been secondary, though certainly not unimportant. Partly because of this, Canada did not suffer as greatly from the pains of [[deindustrialization]] in the 1970s and 1980s.

Central Canada is home to [[branch plant]]s to all the major American and Japanese automobile makers and many parts factories owned by Canadian firms such as [[Magna International]] and [[Linamar|Linamar Corporation]]. Central Canada today produces more vehicles each year than the neighboring U.S. state of [[Michigan]], the heart of the American automobile industry. Manufacturers have been attracted to Canada due to the highly educated population with lower labour costs than the United States. Canada's publicly funded health care system is also an important attraction, as it exempts companies from the high health insurance costs they must pay in the United States.

Much of the Canadian manufacturing industry consists of branch plants of United States firms, though there are some important domestic manufacturers, such as [[Bombardier]]. This has raised several concerns for Canadians. Branch plants provide mainly [[Blue-collar worker|blue collar]] jobs, with research and executive positions confined to the United States.

===Service sector===
[[Image:TD Centre View from Yonge and King.JPG|thumb|300px|right|The [[Toronto-Dominion Centre]] in Toronto]]
The service sector in Canada is vast and multifaceted, employing some three quarters of Canadians and accounting for over two thirds of GDP.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ca.html#Econ CIA World Factbook - Canada]</ref> The largest employer is the [[retail]] sector, employing almost 12% of Canadians.<ref>Wallace, Iain, ''A Geography of the Canadian Economy.'' Don Mills: Oxford University Press, 2002.</ref> The retail industry is mainly concentrated in a relatively small number of chain stores clustered together in [[shopping mall]]s. In recent years the rise of [[big-box store]]s, such as [[Wal-Mart]] (of the United States) and [[Future Shop]] (a subsidiary of the US based [[Best Buy]]), have led to fewer workers in this sector and a migration of retail jobs to the suburbs.

The second largest portion of the service sector is the business services, employing only a slightly smaller percentage of the population. This includes the [[financial services]], [[real estate]], and communications industries. This portion of the economy has been rapidly growing in recent years. It is largely concentrated in the major urban centres, especially [[Toronto]] and Calgary (see [[Banking in Canada]]).

The education and health sectors are two of Canada's largest, but both are largely under the purview of the government. The health care industry has been rapidly growing, and is the third largest in Canada. Its rapid growth has led to problems for governments who must find money to fund it.

Canada has an important [[high tech]] industry, and also an entertainment industry creating content both for local and international consumption. [[Tourism in Canada|Tourism]] is of ever increasing importance, with the vast majority of international visitors coming from the United States. Though the recent strength of the Canadian Dollar has hurt this sector, other nations such as China have increased tourism to Canada.

==Political issues==
===Regional imbalances===
The Canadian economy differs greatly from region to region.  Traditionally Central Canada has been the economic engine of Canada, home to more than half of its population and much of its industry. Recent years have seen rapid growth in Western Canada as trade with Asia has enriched British Columbia and oil wealth provided a major boost to Alberta and Saskatchewan.

The four Atlantic provinces, though once the centre of economic activity, underwent a major decline in the late 19th century and have traditionally been significantly poorer than the rest of Canada, especially after the recent collapse of the fishing industry. Recent years have seen some significant moves towards diversification, especially as offshore oil and gas wealth have begun to flow into the region. Quebec has also traditionally been poorer than the Canadian average although by a lesser margin than the Atlantic provinces. Although in more recent years [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] have started to see a change in their economy being called the "Celtic tiger of Canada" comparing it the economic transformation in Ireland and it has also been called a "mini Alberta".

===Relations with the U.S.===
{{main|Canada – United States relations}}
Canada and the United States share a deep and common trading relationship. Canada's job market continues to perform well along with the US, reaching a 30 year low in the unemployment rate in December 2006, following 14 consecutive years of employment growth.<ref>[http://www.statcan.ca/Daily/English/070105/d070105a.htm The Daily, Friday, January 5, 2007. Labour Force Survey<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Disputes over trade [[tariffs]], multi-lateral military action and controversial Canadian legislation such as [[same-sex marriage]], [[immigration law]], and legal [[medical marijuana]] have raised tensions and cooled relations between these two countries.

Despite these differences, the United States is by far Canada's largest trading partner, with more than [http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/gblec02a.htm $1.7] billion [[Canadian dollar|CAD]] in trade per day in 2005. 81% of Canada's exports go to the United States, and 67% of Canada's imports are from the United States.<ref>[http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/gblec02a.htm Imports, exports and trade balance of goods on a balance-of-payments basis, by country or country grouping<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Trade with Canada makes up for 23% of exports and 17% of imports for the United States.<ref>[http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/highlights/top/top0512.html FTD - Statistics - Trade Highlights - Top Trading Partners<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  By comparison, in 2005 this was more than U.S. trade with all countries in the [[European Union]] combined,<ref>[http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c0003.html FTD - Statistics - Country Data - U.S. Trade Balance with European Union<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and well over twice U.S. trade with all the countries of [[Latin America]] combined.<ref>[http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c0009.html#2005 FTD - Statistics - Country Data - U.S. Trade Balance with South and Central America<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Just the two-way trade that crosses the [[Ambassador Bridge]] between Michigan and Ontario equals all U.S. exports to [[Japan]]. Canada's importance to the United States is not just a border-state phenomenon: Canada is the leading export market for 35 of 50 U.S. states, and is the United States' largest foreign supplier of energy.

Bilateral trade increased by 52% between 1989, when the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement (FTA) went into effect, and 1994, when the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) superseded it. {{Fact|date=September 2007}} Trade has since increased by 40%. NAFTA continues the FTA's moves toward reducing trade barriers and establishing agreed upon trade rules. It also resolves some long-standing bilateral irritants and liberalizes rules in several areas, including agriculture, services, energy, financial services, investment, and government procurement. NAFTA forms the largest trading area in the world, embracing the 406 million people of the three North American countries.

The largest component of U.S.-Canada trade is in the commodity sector.

The U.S. is Canada's largest agricultural export market, taking well over half of all Canadian food exports.<ref>[http://ats.agr.ca/stats/4141_e.pdf Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada / Agriculture et Agroalimentaire Canada<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Similarly, Canada is the largest market for U.S. agricultural goods with nearly 20% of American food exports going to its Northern neighbor{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. Nearly two-thirds of Canada's forest products, including pulp and paper, are exported to the United States; 72% of Canada's total newsprint production also is exported to the U.S.

At [http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/statistics/energy/default.html $73.6] billion in 2004, U.S.-Canada trade in energy is the largest U.S. energy trading relationship, with the overwhelming majority ($66.7 billion) being exports from Canada. The primary components of U.S. energy trade with Canada are [[petroleum]], [[natural gas]], and [[electricity]]. Canada is the United States' largest oil supplier and the fifth-largest energy producing country in the world. Canada provides about 16% of U.S. oil imports and 14% of total U.S. consumption of natural gas. The United States and Canada's national electricity grids are linked and both countries share hydro power facilities on the Western borders.

While most of U.S.-Canada trade flows smoothly, there are occasionally bilateral trade disputes, particularly in the agricultural and cultural fields.{{Fact|date=May 2007}} Usually these issues are resolved through bilateral consultative forums or referral to [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) or NAFTA dispute resolution.{{Fact|date=May 2007}} In May 1999, the U.S. and Canadian Governments negotiated an agreement on magazines that provides increased access for the U.S. publishing industry to the Canadian market. The United States and Canada also have resolved several major issues involving fisheries. By common agreement, the two countries submitted a Gulf of Maine boundary dispute to the International Court of Justice in 1981; both accepted the Court's 12 October 1984 ruling which demarcated the territorial sea boundary. A current issue between the United States and Canada is the ongoing [[US - Canada softwood lumber dispute|softwood lumber dispute]], as the U.S. alleges that Canada unfairly subsidizes its forestry industry.{{Facts|date=May 2007}}

In 1990, the United States and Canada signed a bilateral Fisheries Enforcement Agreement, which has served to deter illegal fishing activity and reduce the risk of injury during fisheries enforcement incidents. The U.S. and Canada signed a Pacific Salmon Agreement in June 1999 that settled differences over implementation of the 1985 Pacific Salmon Treaty for the next decade.{{Facts|date=May 2007}}

Canada and the United States signed an aviation agreement during [[Bill Clinton]]'s visit to Canada in February 1995, and air traffic between the two countries has increased dramatically as a result. The two countries also share in operation of the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]], connecting the [[Great Lakes]] to the [[Atlantic Ocean]].{{Facts|date=May 2007}}

The U.S. is Canada's largest foreign investor; at the end of 1999, the stock of U.S. direct investment was estimated at $116.7 billion, or about 72% of total foreign direct investment in Canada. U.S. investment is primarily in Canada's mining and smelting industries, petroleum, chemicals, the manufacture of machinery and transportation equipment, and finance.{{Facts|date=May 2007}}

Canada is the third-largest foreign investor in the United States. At the end of 1999, the stock of Canadian direct investment in the United States was estimated at $90.4 billion. Canadian investment in the United States is concentrated in manufacturing, wholesale trade, real estate, petroleum, finance, and insurance and other services.{{Facts|date=May 2007}}

==Notes==
<ref>There is an apparent discrepancy between the factbook's 65.4% of GDP estimate for Canada's debt in 2006 [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ca.html], and the 30.2% trumpeted by the Canadian government at [http://www.fin.gc.ca/ec2006/ec/eca1e.html]. Both numbers are correct. The reason is that the Canadian government uses the OECD's ''net'' financial liabilities, while the CIA World Factbook uses a different measure of financial liabilities. The OECD itself reports the gross number as 68%, and the net number as 30.2% [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m4456/is_80/ai_n18617470]. The net number places Canada as one of the least indebted G8 countries, while the gross number is less flattering.</ref>
