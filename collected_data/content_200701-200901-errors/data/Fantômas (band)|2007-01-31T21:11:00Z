'''Fantômas''' is an [[avant-garde metal]] [[Rock band|band]] formed in [[1998 in metal|1998]] in [[California]], [[United States of America|United States]]. The band is named after [[Fantômas]], a [[villain]] featured in a series of [[crime novel]]s popular in [[France]] before [[World War I]].

==History==
The band was formed when singer [[Mike Patton]] composed a handful of [[spasm]]ic, [[avant-garde metal]] songs after the collapse of his earlier group, [[Faith No More]]. Patton then sent the original compositions to his friends, hoping to form a performing group: [[guitarist]] [[Buzz Osborne]] (of [[The Melvins]]), [[Bass guitarist|bassist]] [[Trevor Dunn]] (of [[Mr. Bungle]]) and [[drummer]] [[Igor Cavalera]] (of [[Sepultura]]). Cavalera declined the offer, but recommended whom he thought would be perfect for the project: [[Dave Lombardo]] of [[Slayer]]. Lombardo accepted and thus was formed Patton's own [[supergroup]].{{fact}}

In summer of [[2005]] the band toured [[Europe]] with [[Terry Bozzio]] on drums, because Lombardo was on tour with [[Slayer]]. Lombardo returned to the band for the final dates of the tour, which concluded on September 15, 2005, however, there are rumours that Bozzio will perform drumming duties on a future Fantômas album.[http://www.cv.org/2005/09/02/patton-has-ideas-for-upcoming-fantomas-albums/]

On [[May 13]], [[2006]], Patton revealed to Billboard.com that a fifth Fantômas album has been planned. Of the album, Patton says "The next record is going to be an all-electronic affair. It's going to take some creative planning on how to record it and execute it, but there will be no acoustic instruments on it whatsoever. We're pretty much about to go into [[Hiatus|hibernation mode]]. I need to, once I have a little time, go back to the drawing board, and start writing the next one."[http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=52216]

==Style==
Though rooted in [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], their music actually touches on many different [[musical genre]]s, and is noted for its offbeat sense of humor; one critic has dubbed their style "[[dada]]-metal" [http://www.fantomas-lives.com/]  Critic Greg Prato describes their music as "completely original ... especially when compared to the blah and predictable [[Alternative rock|alt-rock]] of the late '90s."[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:xe2ibkr90ak0] Patton rarely sings conventional lyrics with the group, preferring his own bizarre style of [[Voice instrumental music|voice music]] or [[scat singing]]. 

Fantômas songs are often discordant and tuneless, using feedback and pure noise, and they could easily be described as [[Progressive music|progressive]] [[noise music|noise]]. However, they are not a pure noise band as they do have concrete beats and melodies in most of their songs. They are a unique combination of noise and progressive psychedelia.

They also arrange albums around strange [[concept album|concepts]] or themes: 
*''[[Fantômas (album)|Fantômas (Amenaza Al Mundo)]]'' was based on science fiction [[comic books]], with every song simply given a page number (Page 1, Page 2 etc.). 
*''[[The Director's Cut]]'' was a series of reinterpretations of [[motion picture]] [[theme song]]s. Some versions are rather loyal to the sources (such as the eerie [[lullabye]] from [[The Night of the Hunter (film)|The Night of the Hunter]]), while others offer radical takes on the music (such the theme from ''[[The Godfather]]'' tackled as a [[thrash metal]] song).
*''[[Delìrium Còrdia]]'' was one extended song, with the concept of [[surgery]] without [[anesthesia]].{{fact}}
*''[[Suspended Animation (Fantômas album)|Suspended Animation]]'' (Recorded in the same sessions as ''Delìrium Còrdia'') is an album of twisted [[cartoon music]], each track named after a day in the month of April [[2005]]. (Friday The 8th, etc.).
