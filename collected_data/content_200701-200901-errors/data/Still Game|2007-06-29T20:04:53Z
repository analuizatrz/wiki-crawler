'''''Still Game''''' is a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[sitcom]], a [[spin-off]] from the [[sketch show]] series ''[[Chewin' the Fat]]''. Originally beginning as a stage play, it was created by ''Chewin' The Fat'''s [[Ford Kiernan]] and [[Greg Hemphill]], who also play the lead characters. Since it debuted on September 1st, 2002, ''Still Game'' has shown [[List of Still Game episodes|thirty five episodes]], including a [[Christmas]] and [[Hogmanay]] special.

The title refers to the antics of two [[Glasgow|Glaswegian]] [[pensioner]]s named Jack Jarvis and Victor McDade. Set in Craiglang, a [[fictional]] district of [[Glasgow]], the show follows the lives of Jack, Victor and their various friends. The show started its first series being broadcast on [[BBC One Scotland]]; the further two series followed suit. It was not until the [[Still Game#Series 4 (2005)|fourth series]] that ''Still Game'' was given a UK-wide broadcast on [[BBC Two]]. Since then, the show has gained favourable critical reviews and attracted many fans, achieving higher ratings than the following comedy shows broadcast during the [[BBC Two|BBC Two Comedy Zone]]. 

==History==
[[Image:Stillgamecover.jpg|thumb|150px|left|The stage play of ''Still Game'']]
''Still Game'' was originally a stage play featuring the characters of Jack Jarvis, Victor McDade and Winston Ingram; the three were retained for the show. In this version, due to a broken lift, the three old men are stranded in Victor's flat, where they discuss a variety of subjects ranging from death to sex. The stage play toured Scotland, [[England]], [[Ireland]] and [[Canada]] before returning to Glasgow, where it was filmed and released on [[VHS]].

Many changes occurred when the play made its transition to television. [[Gavin Mitchell (actor)|Gavin Mitchell]], who originally played Winston (and was replaced with Paul Riley for later performances), now plays the part of Boaby the Barman in the television series. Later television characters Tam Mullen and Isa Drennan are also mentioned in the play but with differences to their counterparts. Notably, Winston refers to his home help catching him dancing in the [[bookmaker|bookies]], a scene that would later be re-used for series two of the show.

In 1998, characters Jack and Victor appeared in a tongue-in-cheek documentary about Scottish [[pop music]] called ''Och Around the Clock'', presented by [[Dougie Vipond]]. They appeared in a number of skits spread throughout the show, in which they were  shown to be watching the show in Victor's flat. In a similar manner to the [[Muppet]] characters of [[Statler and Waldorf]], the skit centred on them making disparaging comments about the performers.

The characters were then featured in Kiernan and Hemphill's sketch show ''[[Chewin' the Fat]]''. Nearly every episode of ''Chewin' The Fat'' featured Jack, Victor, Tam and Winston (although until the 4th series they looked different from their Still Game appearance) singing in the pub, usually accompanied with another sketch featuring just Jack and Victor. However, Winston also features in two other sketches with Tam appearing in one, where he is introduced by Winston as a thief. By the time ''Still Game'' was thought of as its own show, Winston's appearance had been drastically changed but was still played by [[Paul Riley]]. As the show progressed into later series, characters such as Winston, Isa and the local shopkeeper, Navid Harrid have become more popular.

==Filming locations==
[[Image:theclansmanjennys.JPG|200px|left|thumb|The local [[pub]], Jenny's, as seen in ''"Hard Nuts"''.]]
Although ''Still Game'' is set in the fictional Craiglang area of [[Glasgow]], the [[Maryhill]] district of the city is one of the most common filming locations. The [[Forth and Clyde Canal]] and its locks are used in background shots, as are the high-rise tower blocks, including the one in which Jack and Victor live called "Osprey Heights". For the first three series of the show, a real pub ("The Gimlet") was used to film the exterior shots of the pub Jenny's, previously The Clansman. However, between series three and four, the owner of the pub tore the building down, causing the fourth series production team to build an exterior in a set in Dumbarton, the same lot where ''[[River City (TV series)|River City]]'' is filmed.

Finport, as mentioned and seen in the fifth series, was actually filmed on location in [[Largs]] and [[Saltcoats]], [[North Ayrshire]], both of which were once popular seaside resorts with Glaswegians. The shots of the promenade and the sea wall is that of Saltcoats' harbour area. The pub scene is set in the Royal Oak pub in Largs, while the [[bed and breakfast]], where Jack and Victor stay the night in, is located in the north end of Largs promenade. In the scene where Jack and Victor arrive on the bus from the right in Finport this actually leads from the sea, there is no road there. In the scene where Jack and Victor find Winston, a wide panning shot reveals the famous Nardini ice-cream building and the [[Caledonian MacBrayne]] ferry to [[Millport]].

== Series summaries ==
{{main|List of Still Game episodes}}

For the show's first two series, the broadcast of ''Still Game'' was limited to [[BBC One Scotland]]. The show was then moved to [[BBC Two]] for the fourth series and shown throughout [[Great Britain]]. On December 28 2005, ''Still Game'''s first [[Christmas television special|Christmas special]] was shown on [[BBC One]], the first national broadcast of the show on the channel. A fifth series of the show started filming in February 2006 and was shown the following June on BBC Two. As of 2006, series three had not been shown nationally, and only five episodes from the first two series were shown on national BBC Two from 17 January to 14 February 2004.

In the first three series, the episode titles were all [[Scots language]] words that were related to the episode. Starting from season four, the episodes were titled using standard English so that national audiences could understand them.

The events of ''Still Game'' take place in a [[floating timeline]] where the characters remain the same age from series to series. One of the most prominent examples of this is that Victor reveals that he is 74 years old in ''Scran'', an episode of the second series, but it is not until the fifth series (''Smoke On The Water'') that he celebrates his 75th birthday.

==Errors and inconsistencies==
*In the credits of series one to three, Navid was listed as Navid Ingram; Ingram being Winston's surname. The error was removed for series four and subsequent [[DVD]] releases.

*In the episode, "Courtin'", Jack and Victor tell the charity shop worker, Barbara, that they are from Craigbank, a real area in Glasgow. They were meant to say Craiglang, the fictional district where the show is set.

*In the episode "Big Yin", when Jack and Victor mention "Big Innes" to Navid, they say that Innes was before Navid's time, meaning that Navid would not know who he was, and that he lived in Craiglang up until about fifteen years ago. Yet in the episode "Oot", when Isa is giving a rundown of past events, when the year [[1974]] appears, there is a man obviously meant to be a young Navid.  This error is repeated in the Hogmanay special when Navid is introduced as having just taken over the shop.

*In "Flittin'", Victor says that his son who lives in [[Johannesburg]] is called Jamie. He's actually called John. The names John and Jack are often used by the older generation in Scotland to address someone whose first name is James, so it could be said that Victor was correct to call his son Jamie. Jack also points out that he is thirty years old in "Flittin". When we actually see him later on in the series in "Aff", he is closer to fifty.

*In the episode, "Shooglies", Jack and Victor spend a day in Glasgow City Centre. When returning on the bus, they decide to pay a visit to the [[Glasgow Museum of Transport|Glasgow Transport Museum]]. However, the shot of Jack and Victor getting off the bus indicates that it's actually heading from Partick ''into'' the City Centre, rather than away from it.

*In the same episode when Jack and Victor get off the bus at the Transport Museum, you can clearly see that in the background it is a pleasant dry day but in the scene on the museum steps, it is dull and raining. The ground is also very wet looking, indicating that it has been raining for some time.  

*Series one was not aired in the same order that it was originally intended to be. This led to a continuity error in "Scones" in which Navid owns a painting of the [[Taj Mahal]]. This is the exact same as the one Winston gives to him in the following episode "Waddin'". This error was fixed in the DVD release.

*In the very first episode ("Flittin'"), when Jack is moving house, he and Victor are sitting on Jack's sofa. Victor comments to Jack, "Seventy-four years on the planet and this is all you have amassed." It later emerges, in the episode "Scran", that Jack is in fact just seventy-two years old. However, Victor could be referring to his own birthdate.

*In the episode "Cauld" Jack and Victor tell Isa in the lift in Osprey Heights that they are going to the eighth floor. This is the same as Manky Frankie. However, when Tam and Winston are heading towards the same floor in the episode "Brief" they announce that they are heading up to the ninth floor.  This also contradicts with "Flittin", in which Jack instructs the removal van driver that their residence is on the eighteenth floor.

*In the Hogmany Special, which the flashbacks are set in 1975 Victor does not know Isa. But in "Whose the Daddy" a flashback shows Victor did indeed know Isa during the fifties as they were born in sometime in the thrirties and Winston says that they were twenty during the fifties.

*Victor claims he and Jack were born and raised in Craiglang, this may be the case for Jack , but Victor was introduced as moving in during the 70's

==Trivia==
*Just before the fifth series started filming, a pest control team had to be called in to the set when it was discovered that rats had infested Navid's shop and were eating their way through the stock. The alarm was raised after Jane McCarry (Isa) found a dead rat on the set.<ref name="daily record3">{{cite web | title=Daily Record | work=A FORD IN THE RIVER | url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=16708129&method=full&siteid=66633&headline=a-ford-in-the-river--name_page.html/ | accessdate=August 4 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>
*The first 5 series were made by the Comedy Unit production company who also made ''Chewin' the Fat'' and ''[[Rab C. Nesbitt]]'', but after the Comedy Unit was sold, Greg and Ford decided to leave and go independent.
*In the episode "A Fresh Lick", Navid is distracted with the videotape in the back of the shop.  The customer he is meant to be serving eventually says she will go to "Kohli's".  This is a nod to Sanjeev Kohli, who plays the part of Navid.
*Scotland's [[2006 UEFA U-19 Championship (squads)#Scotland|under-nineteen football team]] were noted to have watched ''Still Game'' before going on to win against the [[2006 UEFA U-19 Championship (squads)#Czech Republic|Czech Republic]] in the [[2006 European Under-19 Football Championship]].<ref name=dailyrecord5>{{cite web | title=Daily Record | work=JACK AND VICTORY | url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=17457298&method=full&siteid=66633&headline=jack-and-victory--name_page.html | accessdate=August 6 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>
*The theme tune is a shortened version of a track by the [[Cuban Boys]] entitled: ''"Cuban Boy (Cuban Boys Go Boom! mix)'', which features on their debut album ''Blueprint from Modernisation''. The full length version can be downloaded from their official website.<ref name=cubanboys>http://freespace.virgin.net/skreen.b/virtualbox/cuban_virtual.htm</ref> This theme has been replaced with a different theme in the DVD release to avoid copyright restrictions. However, the DVDs of the first three series released in Scotland between 2002 and 2004 have the original theme.
