==Plot==
{{spoilers}}

The story  revolves around Richter Boudreau ([[Eric Stoltz]]), a man from a privileged background who works as a movie reviewer at the local newspaper only  because his sour mother ([[Mary Tyler Moore]])pulled strings for him. He is dissatisfied with the direction that his life has taken. He also does drugs and is so deeply in debt that his electricity has been cut off. He owes money to Ronnie Stover ([[James Spader]]), an abusive white trashy drug dealer. Ronnie is married to Vicky ([[Deborah Kara Unger]]), who was disowned by her family for marrying Ronnie. Vicky is the sister of Keith (Michael Rooker), an [[misogynistic]] [[alcoholic]] whose large inheritance fails to soothe his anger, loneliness, and [[depression]]. Cherry (Joanna Going) is the [[exotic dancer]] from [[Chicago]] who buys drugs from Ronnie.

Ronnie plans to [[blackmail]] Bedford Shaw ([[Marco Perella]]), the son of a socially prominent business man, after Cherry tells him that Shaw murdered an [[African-American]] [[stripper]]/[[prostitute]] in a motel room and that she took pictures of the whole thing. When Ronnie attempts to involve Richter in his plans by having him look after Cherry and a mysterious black pouch and by exploiting his newspaper connections, Richter spends the rest of the film unsuccessfully trying to extricate himself.
