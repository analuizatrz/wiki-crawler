{{Nihongo|'''''Elfen Lied '''''|エルフェンリート|Erufen Rīto}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[manga]] series created by [[Mangaka|manga author]] [[Lynn Okamoto]]. A thirteen-episode [[anime]] [[television series]] adaptation based on the manga was produced by the studio ARMS and broadcast on [[TV Tokyo]] from July to October 2004; the anime was later licensed in [[North America]] on [[DVD]] by [[ADV Films]]. The anime started before the manga was complete; as a result, the plot differed between the two, especially towards the ending of the story. In 2005, a special [[original video animation]], written to occur between the tenth and eleventh episodes of the series, was released. The title is literally [[German language|German]] for "Elves' Song", or more properly translated "Song of the Elves", and takes its name from the poem ''[[Elfenlied]]'' and the German word ''[[lied]]'', a [[Classical period|classical]]-[[Romantic period|romantic]] poem or musical work.

''Elfen Lied'' revolves around the interactions, views, emotions, and discrimination between humans and the [[Diclonius (Elfen Lied)|diclonius]], a [[mutant]] species similar to humans in build but distinguishable by two cat-ear-like horns and "vectors", transparent arms which can pass through air and objects at high speed.  The series is centered around the teenage Diclonius girl "[[Lucy (Elfen Lied)|Lucy]]", said to be the first Diclonius, becoming [[Sadism|sadistic]] as a result of her vengeance and delivering it on the humans who rejected her.

''Elfen Lied'' involves themes of [[social alienation]], [[Identity (social science)|identity]], [[Cruelty to animals|animal cruelty]], [[revenge]], [[child abuse]], [[jealousy]] and the value of [[humanity]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.vap.co.jp/elfenlied/bstage.html |title=Backstage - Official Elfen Lied website|accessdate=2007-12-01|language=Japanese}}</ref> The series employs [[graphic violence]] and [[nudity]], especially the graphic opening sequence of the first episode. So far, only the thirteen-episode anime series has been licensed in the [[United States]], by [[ADV Films]] and in [[Australia]], by [[Madman Entertainment]]. ADV Films said the series was one of their bestselling and "most notorious" releases of 2005.<ref>{{cite news |last=Solomon |first=Charles |title=Mean Girls |date=[[July 17]] [[2005]] |publisher=New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/17/arts/television/17solo.html?ex=1145419200&en=f50bd37485179e26&ei=5070}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |publisher = ADV Films | date = [[September 28]] [[2005]] | title = Great Reason To Give Thanks With Nine New Releases November 15th | url =http://www.advfilms.com/GEN_PRDetails.asp?ID=1724 }}</ref>

==Plot==
The story is based around the [[Diclonius (Elfen Lied)|Diclonius]], a species of evolved humans with two cat-ear like horns and ''vectors'', [[telekinesis|telekinetically]] controlled arms which resonate at a frequency to the point in which they become transparent, and have the power to manipulate objects within their range. Most Diclonius seem to be girls; male Diclonius are rare throughout the whole series (first one being the Professor at Kohta's school as seen in the manga). In the anime the female Diclonius have uncommon hair and eye colors such as red and pink unlike regular humans who have brown, black, blond, and red hair. In the manga, their hair coloring can be as diverse as a normal human's (ex. Nana and Mariko have purple and blond hair, respectively, in the manga).

At the beginning of the series, Diclonius are being held for storage in a facility off the coast of [[Kamakura]] in [[Kanagawa]], south of the city of [[Yokohama]], held by the scientist Kurama. The first of the Diclonius race, a teenage girl named by the staff as "[[Lucy and Nyū|Lucy]]," escapes the factory stark naked (except for a metal helmet encasing her head) and, using her vectors to deflect gunfire, effortlessly kills the security guards and Kurama's clumsy secretary in her path. However, as she makes her way out of the facility, she is shot in the side of the head by an unnamed sniper armed with a .50 caliber rifle, breaking her metal helmet and causing her to fall into the sea.

The next morning, Kohta, a university-age school student, is moving to Kamakura to study in a university where he is reunited with his cousin Yuka. While reminiscing about his younger sister on a beach, who is later explained to have died "of an illness," he encounters the Diclonius, still naked and brain damaged from the bullet wound, only capable of saying the word "Nyu." Kohta and Yuka decide to take her with them, naming her "Nyu" as a result.

The homeless girl Mayu and her dog encounter Nyu, where she and Kohta come across a [[Special Assault Team]] task force sent by Kurama to find Nyu, led by Bando, a ruthless, cold-hearted soldier, and Nana, another Diclonius, to hunt her down.  However, Lucy and her cold characteristics have not yet faded away; whenever she hits her head or when she is confronted with violence, she reverts to her sadistic side, and makes transitions between her two personalities throughout the series, the first of which is seen against Bando, who has his eyes poked out, and Nana, who has all her limbs ripped off by Lucy's vectors.  Eventually, Kurama decides to take Bando and Nana back to Kamakura, Bando to find Lucy, and Nana to be released into the world contrary to the instructions given to Kurama to put her down.  Mayu and Nana both end up living in Kohta's household, where significant parts of their past come together.

Several developments in the story are made and explained in the latter end of the series.  All the characters have mysterious and tragic pasts which somehow intertwine with each other, and, as their individual stories are retold, they all come together.  Mayu is revealed to have been molested by her stepfather, and Kurama is also revealed to be a carrier of Diclonius DNA.  Professor Kakuzawa, Kurama's colleague and the son of his boss, is revealed to be a Diclonius just seconds before his head gets torn off by Lucy.  Kurama's wife died as a result of complications after giving birth, and Kurama was almost forced to kill his newborn Diclonius daughter, however Kakuzawa's father, the head of the facility, agreed to let her live on the condition that explosives be planted inside her to be detonated if she escapes the facility and causes destruction in the human world.  Lucy's past, why she turned sadistic, and her connections with Kohta are also revealed.

Toward the end of the series, Kurama is forced to risk the fate of both diclonius and humanity by unleashing Mariko, his Diclonius daughter and disputedly the most powerful Diclonius, to kill Lucy and return the species into hiding forever.  Mariko, Nana, Lucy and Kurama all cross paths near a bridge by the seaside, where Mariko and Nana discover that they both believe themselves to be Kurama's daughter, and Lucy is almost killed by Mariko.  However, as Lucy kills the search team accompanying Mariko in retrieving her, including the majority of the remaining staff at the facility, Kurama is cornered with the last three diclonius left.  He chooses instead to spend a final father-daughter moment and die with Mariko as the explosives in her detonate.  Nana returns to the household with Kohta, Yuka and Mayu, and Lucy sees Kohta on the same set of steps as where they had their final conversation eight years earlier, telling him her true feelings, her remorse, and how she is in love with Kohta.  Lucy leaves to face the remaining assault team deployed by the facility; her ultimate fate is unknown.

===Differences between media===
The anime adaptation of ''Elfen Lied'' takes a different approach to its depiction of the diclonius, and provides less details about the diclonius virus. The diclonius characters are shown to have distinct limits on their vectors' quantity and range, which are non-existent in the manga. The anime also eliminates some characters introduced in the manga.

==Characters==
{{main|List of Elfen Lied characters}}
* {{Nihongo|'''Lucy'''|ルーシー |Rūshī}} is a [[teenage]] [[Diclonius (Elfen Lied)|diclonius]] girl around eighteen years old. Within her two-meter range, she can be swift and lethal, and will use any nearby objects as high velocity [[projectile]]s to kill at greater distances. She is also capable of stopping or deflecting most standard ammunition as she concentrates on the action. Lucy has developed strong emotions of hatred and vengeance towards regular humans mainly because of how she was treated by the majority of them as a child, making fun of her horns and giving her insulting nicknames such as freak. Consequently, she discounts regular humans, claiming they are not real people. She seems to lack [[empathy]], kills without much concern, and acts somewhat sadistically, however towards the end of the series, she begins to show remorse for her actions, especially towards Kohta. {{anime voices|Sanae Kobayashi|Kira Vincent-Davis}}

* {{Nihongo|'''Nyu'''|にゅう|Nyū}} is a [[dissociative identity disorder|split personality]] of Lucy that developed after a [[.50 BMG]] round ricocheted off a metallic helmet encasing her head. Nyu has a childlike personality and infantile knowledge of the world, forgetting even that she is a Diclonius and how to use or manifest her vectors leaving her a human with horns. She initially lacks spoken [[language]] skills; however, she eventually learns a handful of words and phrases until (in the manga) she can finally speak properly despite the fact she still uses the non-nonsensical phrase ''nyu'' as her catchphrase. Nyu is innocent and incapable of violent acts, a [[Foil (literature)|foil]] to the normally cold and sadistic Lucy; she is the manifestation of her "good side". Whenever Nyu hits her head or when she is confronted with violence, she reverts to her sadistic side, Lucy. {{anime voices|Sanae Kobayashi|Kira Vincent-Davis}}

* {{Nihongo|'''Kohta'''|コウタ|Kōta}} is around nineteen years old and enters the story when his cousin's family allows him to move in to their closed-down inn in exchange for maintenance while he goes to a local [[university]]. Kohta has [[repressed memory|repressed]] [[Psychological trauma|traumatic]] [[memory|memories]] of his father's and sister's deaths during his childhood at Lucy's hands. Because of him repressing his memories, Kohta does not remember Lucy from when he met her earlier as a child. Due in part to his loss, he has a soft spot for girls in trouble and is extremely generous and protective to the girls around him. He is more forgiving in the anime, but in the manga when he gets his memories back he truly is unforgiving about Lucy killing his father and sister. {{anime voices|Chihiro Suzuki|Adam Conlon}}

* {{Nihongo|'''Yuka'''|ユカ}} is Kohta's [[cousin]].<ref>Elfen Lied Ep. 1: Yuka greets Kohta and then says "''Yuka desu... Itoko no...''"「ユカです…従姉妹の…」, which quite unambiguously translates as "I'm Yuka. Your cousin."</ref> She is also around nineteen years old and planning to attend the same university as Kohta.  She last saw Kohta when they were ten, parting ways with him on the same night in which Lucy killed Kohta's family, completely oblivious to the events following their last meeting.  She moves in with him at the [[inn]] after having not seen him in many years. Having had a crush on Kohta since childhood, she is in love with him,<ref>Yuka's relationship with Kohta may be considered [[taboo]] or illegally [[incest]]uous by [[United States|U.S.]] viewers, but relationships between cousins is not considered scandalous in [[Japan]] and is a topic seen regularly in anime. See: ''[http://www.animenation.net/blog/2006/08/14/ask-john-why-is-romance-between-cousins-common-in-anime/ Why is Romance Between Cousins Common in Anime?]''</ref> and is therefore jealous of Kohta's attention to Nyu (and the other female characters who move in with them), to the point of being very irrational. {{anime voices|Mamiko Noto|Nancy Novotny}}

==Style and themes==
[[Image:ELep1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The first seven minutes of the first episode are known to be some of the most provocative of anime, containing nudity and strong graphic violence.]]In the comments made by director Mamoru Kanbe on the Elfen Lied website, he intended for the anime to question and discuss values based on the way in which humans divide each other by difference, as well as the belief that atrocities such as those committed by Lucy in the series are strongly influenced by the way in which people are treated by their fellow beings.  The series frequently discusses the events and treatment which define the human character in such a way, and the problems which arise from discrimination, as well as the wild contrasts between compassion and vengeance between fellow humans, through the strong vengeance of Lucy compared with her past memory of Kouta.  Many of the themes are mentioned at the teasers at the ends of episodes in the series.

Themes such as genocide and the attempts to "purify" the earth from each other also appear in the anime between diclonius and humans.  Both species feel the need to populate the earth with their own species and wipe each other out.  Kanbe quoted this in relation to the desire of humans to cast each other out and segregate each other.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.vap.co.jp/elfenlied/bstage.html |title=Backstage - Official Elfen Lied website|accessdate=2007-12-01|language=Japanese}}</ref>

Throughout the series, there is a great deal of [[nudity]], blood and gore, extreme [[graphic violence]] as well as [[psychology|psychological]] [[violence]]. One of the most prevalent motifs of the series is the humanity of the diclonius, especially contrasted against the inhumanity of ordinary people. One reviewer described the series as "devoted to quite a few of the darker, more callous factors of human nature".<ref name="them1"/> Throughout the series there are various incidences of human [[Sadism and Masochism|sadism]], casual beatings, cruel experimentation, and outright killing.

[[Image:Elfen intro Kilmt fulfilment.jpeg|thumb|left|250px|The intro scenes of Elfen Lied are an homage to [[Gustav Klimt]]'s artwork such as [[The Kiss (Klimt painting)|The Kiss]].]] Unlike other anime which distinctively fall into a specific subcategory, ''Elfen Lied'' does not fall under any specific genre, containing elements of horror, comedy, drama, romance, action, science-fiction, and suspense. A majority of the episodes contain graphic amounts of violence and gruesome deaths. There is also a lot of female nudity and serious thematic material such as child rape and torture. The series also sometimes has strong language; the word "fuck" is used several times throughout in the English localization. Compared to the other anime of its time, the series is very radical, bold and daring in terms of its plot and content.  The series juxtaposes many different tones and genres and was described by a reviewer as "mixing insane amounts of violence with a heavy dose of 'ultra-cuteness.'"<ref name="shelf">{{cite web | last = Dong | first = Bamboo | title = Shelf Life - Sound of Bounce on Free Throw | publisher = Anime News Network | date = [[June 29]], [[2005]] | url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/shelf-life/2005-06-29 | accessdate = 2007-01-18}}</ref> The series balances its darker themes with romantic [[sub-plot]]s as well as many comic moments. Elfen Lied has been described as similar to, or borrowing elements from ''[[Chobits]]'', ''[[3x3 Eyes]]''<ref name="scifi"/> and ''[[Gunslinger Girl]]''.<ref name="shelf"/>

===Cultural references===
The opening and ending sequences feature artistic drawings of the principal characters. These characters are drawn in a style based on [[Gustav Klimt]]'s paintings, imitating poses, colors, and patterns.<ref name="scifi"/> The [[Germany|German]] [[Lied|song]] ''[[Elfenlied]]'' ("Elf Song"), from which the title takes its name, appears in the manga<ref>{{cite book | first=Lynn| last=Okamoto | coauthors= | title=Elfen Lied Volume 5 | publisher=Shueisha | pages=154 | id=ISBN 4-08-876477-3|language=Japanese}}</ref> and is credited to the composer [[Hugo Wolf]]. A poem by [[Eduard Mörike]] is the basis for Wolf's version. The song does not appear in the anime as it is taught to Nyu by the manga-only character [[List of Elfen Lied characters#Minor characters|Nozomi]]. All episode titles have dual-titles in German.

==Production==
When work began on adapting the ''Elfen Lied'' manga into an anime series, director [[Mamoru Kanbe]] was recommended to work on series by the series composer [[Takao Yoshioka]]. Yoshioka believed that Kanbe's general [[Moe (slang)|moe]] drawing style and composition would be ideal to adapt the manga, still in publication at the time, into an anime series.  Kanbe himself was originally reluctant about joining the product, however gained interest upon reading the manga.

Kanbe originally thought that "this was a love story, and I could make it so that it would bring viewers to tears."<ref>Exclusive Mamoru Kanbe interview, DVD Extra - Elfen Lied DVD 1 (Vector One). Released by [[Madman Entertainment]] and [[ADV Films]].</ref>  Thus, he made attempts throughout the series to provide a contrast of emotions, commenting that he could make the violence exemplify this throughout the series.  The setting in Kamakura was, according to the production team, ideal for the poignant and reflective drama in the series to unfold, as its general tranquility and geography made for a reflective and yet eerie, deep-meaning backdrop to the series.<ref>{{cite web | title=Production Note, Official Elfen Lied website | publisher=VAP | url=http://www.vap.co.jp/elfenlied/top.html | accessdate=2008-03-20 | language=Japanese}}</ref>

==Media==
===Manga===
{{main|List of Elfen Lied chapters}}
Written by [[Lynn Okamoto]], ''Elfen Lied'' premiered in [[Japan]] in ''[[Weekly Young Jump]]'' magazine in June 2002.  New chapters continued to appear in the magazine until August 2005, when the final chapter was published.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=4233 |title=Elfen Lied (manga) |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=2008-05-28 }}</ref> The series' 107 chapters were also published in twelve [[Tankōbon|collected volumes]] by [[Shueisha]] from October 2002 through November 2005.

===Anime===
{{main|List of Elfen Lied episodes}}
The [[television]] series, directed by Mamoru Kanbe, animated by ARMS and produced by [[GENCO]] and [[VAP]], ran for 13 episodes and adapted approximately the first 60 out of 107 chapters of the manga. Episodes one to eleven of the anime are in [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] with the [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] of the storyline for volumes one to six of the manga, faithfully adapting most of the events happening in the latter. The last two TV episodes strayed from the manga's continuity and gave an original conclusion to the anime. The series' author, [[Lynn Okamoto]], has a brief [[cameo appearance]] as a special guest in episode twelve.

Elfen Lied first aired on [[TV Tokyo]]'s AT-X satellite channel from [[July 25]] [[2004]] to [[October 17]] [[2004]] and was broadcast again in 2005. The anime was licensed by [[ADV Films]] in the [[United States]] in 2004 and was released on [[DVD]] in 2005. A single twenty-four-minute [[original video animation]] episode was also released by VAP on [[April 21]] [[2005]]. It takes place between episodes ten and eleven of the original TV series, and for that reason, some refer to it as ''episode 10.5'', ''OVA special'', or even as ''episode fourteen''. The special itself takes on a lighter tone and answers some questions of the early episodes rather than advancing the plot. During the ''Anime Boston 2006''<ref>{{cite web | title=Anime Boston 2006 - A.D. Vision | publisher=Anime News Network |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/convention.php?id=317 | accessdate=2006-06-05}}</ref> (May 26—28) [[Anime convention|convention]], ADV Films acquired the distribution rights of the OVA for release in the [[United States]]. However, the OVA was never released on television and was not included in the box set released by ADV Films.

The series is currently airing in the [[United Kingdom]] on [[Propeller TV]] ([[Sky Digital (UK)|Sky Digital]]) as part of Anime Network's launch in the UK. So far the series has aired uncut with the exception of one of Mayu's flashbacks in episode five as a result of it being related to [[child rape]] at the hands of a stepfather. While it has yet to appear on US television other than on Anime Network's "On Demand" Channel, the DVD box set confirms that the series has a rating of TV-MAVSL; the Canadian rating is 18A. The [[OVA]] episode was not released with the box set that became available in November 2006.

In a posting on the official [[Adult Swim]] message board, Adult Swim programming director Kim Manning revealed that Adult Swim inquired into possibly airing the series, as she was an avid fan herself and watched the entire series in one sitting.  However, the censorship board revealed that the series would have to be so heavily edited ("it would have been cut to shreds") in order to air that it would have been unintelligible, and it does not appear that it will air on the channel at any time in the foreseeable future.<ref name="el_as">{{citeweb|url=http://boards.adultswim.com/adultswim/board/message?board.id=6&message.id=2856706#M2856706|date=[[April 27]] [[2006]])|title=Re: What kind of anime do you complainers want?|publisher=[[Adult Swim]]|accessdate=2007-09-23}}</ref>

==Reception==
The series has received praise for its story and technical excellence in production quality, animation and color.<ref name="scifi"> {{cite web | last = Robinson | first = Tasha | title = Elfen Lied | Anime Reviews | publisher = Sci Fi Weekly | date = [[August 8]], [[2005]] | url = http://www.scifi.com/sfw/anime/sfw1019.html | accessdate = 2007-01-18}}</ref><ref name="DVD1Review">{{cite web|last=Martin |first=Theron | title=Elfen Lied DVD 1 Review | publisher=Anime News Network | date=[[May 16]], [[2005]] | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/elfen-lied/dvd-1 | accessdate=2006-04-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Martin |first=Theron | title=Elfen Lied DVD 2 Review | publisher=Anime News Network | date=[[July 22]], [[2005]] | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/elfen-lied/dvd-2 | accessdate=2007-01-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last =Pierce | first = Travis | title = Elfen Lied Review | publisher = Gamerz-Edge | date = [[May 27]], [[2005]] | url = http://www.gamerz-edge.com/anime/reviews/elfenlied.html | accessdate = 2007-01-18}}</ref>Due to the many scenes of nudity and gore in the series, it has drawn criticism as being "overly blatant".<ref name="them2"/> or "sad and forced"<ref>{{cite web | title = Negative First Impression Theater: Elfen Lied | publisher = Iron Circus | date = [[February 12]], [[2005]] | url = http://www.ironcircus.com/blog/000319.html | accessdate = 2007-01-22}}</ref>  The boldness of the first seven minutes of the first episode have deterred some viewers and caused controversy as to its release. The first four episodes are liberally scattered with horror and fanservice, often taking the form of bloody violence and random nudity and sexual innuendo.

Despite employing experienced voice actors for both the English and Japanese voice casts, such as [[Mamiko Noto]] and [[Kira Vincent-Davis]], the series drew criticism for having sub-par voice acting across the series in the English dub, as well as in the first few episodes on the Japanese voice-overs.<ref name="DVD1Review" /> Another criticism is that the series ends abruptly with some loose ends to the story that could leave viewers unsatisfied.<ref name="dvd4">{{cite web |last=Martin |first=Theron | title=Elfen Lied DVD 4 Review | publisher=Anime News Network | date=[[November 28]] [[2005]] | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/elfen-lied/dvd-4 | accessdate=2006-04-19}}</ref>
