'''Cribbs Causeway''' is a location just north of [[Bristol]], [[England]], best known for The Mall, a large out-of-town shopping centre. Cribbs Causeway is situated in [[Patchway]], [[South Gloucestershire]], near [[Filton Aerodrome|Filton Airfield]]. The primary access routes are the [[M5 motorway|M5]] Junction 17 and the Patchway bypass road. The Mall, with around 14 million visitors a year, is one of the two major shopping centres in the [[Bristol]] area, the other being [[Bristol city centre|Broadmead]]. 

==The name==
The retail area takes its name from the road that runs from the northern edge of Bristol at [[Henbury]] to a point just beyond the M5 junction. This route is the former [[Roman road]] from central Bristol to the crossing point of the [[River Severn]] at [[Aust]], now parts of the [[A4018 road|A4018]] and [[B4055 road|B4055]]. The name of the road itself is often said to owe its name to [[Tom Cribb]], a famous [[bare-knuckle]] [[boxing|boxer]] from nearby [[Henbury]]. However, a book on the [[street name]]s of Bristol <sup id="fn_1_back">[[#fn 1|1]]</sup> states that this was proved wrong by the discovery of a map showing the current name dated to four years prior to his [[1781]] birth. The book's author goes on to speculate that the true origin of the name may be from ''Crybe's dwelling'' (''Crybe'' being a personal name), or from ''crib'' - a manger or hovel.

==The Mall==
The Mall, opened on [[March 31]] [[1998]], comprises 135 shops on two levels, although some of the large stores occupy more levels. The major businesses are [[Marks and Spencer]], [[John Lewis Partnership|John Lewis]] and [[Boots Group|Boots]]. At its centre point The Mall has a large fountain with an impressive water display. Money thrown into the fountain is donated to local charities. Above the fountain is the extensive food court. The Mall has its own bus station.

==Other sections==
The Venue is an entertainment complex featuring a [[Vue (cinema)|VUE cinema]], a [[Hollywood Bowl]] (opened in November 2004, location was previously a [[Dave & Busters]]), [[Fitness First]] and eating places, such as [[Frankie & Bennys]] and [[TGI Fridays]].

The two retail parks are warehouse style shops with individual entrances from outside. The first retail park is a group of large shops housed in distinctive yellow buildings containing shops such as [[Argos (retailer)|Argos]], [[Currys]], [[Comet]] and [[PC World]]. Nearby is a second retail park containing shops such as [[Halfords]], [[TK Maxx]], [[Carpet World]] and [[Hobbycraft]]. 
Other shops include the United Kingdom's first [[ASDA]]-Wal*Mart hypermarket, the first [[Morrisons]] supermarket in the south of England which opened in September 2003, [[Toys "R" Us]], [[Makro]] and [[dfs (retailer)|DFS]], also car dealers, warehouses, pubs and hotels. Hidden away in a lane that passes under the motorway, is the Cribbs Business Centre.

A [[B&Q]] Warehouse is now completed on the site previously owned by Tile World and [[Magnet (store)|Magnet]]. It is situated near the [[Morrisons]] supermarket. The old building which housed B&Q, near TK Maxx and Hobbycraft, has since been demolished.
