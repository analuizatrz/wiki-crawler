'''Lucius Aelius Seianus''' (or '''Sejanus''') ([[20 BC]] &ndash; [[October 18]], [[31]] AD) was an ambitious soldier, friend and confidant of [[Tiberius]], and for a time the most influential and feared citizen of [[Rome]].

== Overview ==

Sejanus was born at [[Volsinii]], in [[Etruria]], to the family of [[Lucius Seius Strabo]], an [[Equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] who became [[praetorian prefect]] under [[Augustus Caesar|Augustus]].  By [[Roman naming convention#Adoption|Roman custom]] he was known as Aelius Sejanus after his adoption into the more prestigious [[Aelius|Aelian]] [[gens]].

He was appointed praetorian prefect on the accession of [[Tiberius]], as the colleague of his father.  On his father's appointment to the governorship of [[Egypt]] in [[15]], he became sole commander of the [[Praetorian Guard]], and began to increase his power. 

After the death of Tiberius' son [[Drusus Julius Caesar|Drusus]] in [[23]], Sejanus consolidated his power over the Senate, and concentrated the scattered elements of the Praetorian guard into a single camp outside the Viminal Gate of Rome.  Despite failing in an attempt to marry Drusus' widow [[Livilla]] in [[25]], which would have made him part of the ruling house, he increased his power further upon Tiberius' retirement to [[Capri]] in [[27]]. In the ensuing years Sejanus consolidated his own position, working towards the downfall of [[Germanicus]]’ widow [[Agrippina the Elder|Agrippina]] and her sons Nero and Drusus (29-30) and allegedly plotting against the life of the youngest son [[Gaius Caligula]].

== Downfall ==

In 31, despite his [[eques]]trian rank, he shared the [[consul]]ship with Tiberius, and finally became betrothed to [[Livilla]].  Sejanus felt his position was unassailable, and plotted to seize power for himself.  Tiberius discovered the plot, however, and chose [[Naevius Sutorius Macro|Macro]], prefect of the [[Vigiles]], to replace Sejanus as prefect of the Praetorian Guard and accomplish Sejanus’ downfall.  Simultaneously Tiberius wrote a letter to the Senate denouncing Sejanus, where he was arrested and condemned to death and [[damnatio memoriae]]. That evening (October 18) Sejanus was strangled and his body cast onto the [[Gemonian stairs]], where the mob tore it to pieces.  Many of Sejanus' friends and allies were executed or committed suicide after his fall.  His three children were similarly executed; his divorced wife, Apicata, killed herself after accusing him and [[Livilla]] of poisoning Drusus.  The revelations concerning his seduction of Livilla while she was still married to Drusus inevitably cast doubt on the paternity of Livilla's son [[Tiberius Gemellus]].

Writing only a few years later, [[Philo]], a leading figure in Alexandria's Jewish community, remembered Sejanus as "desiring to destroy our nation" (''Legatio ad Gaium'', XXIV).

Sejanus’ victims included the poet [[Phaedrus]], who was suspected of alluding to him in his Fables and received some unknown punishment short of death. (Cf. Fables I.1 [the wolf and the lamb], I.2.24 ''hydrum'' [water-snake], I.17 [the wolf who gives false testimony].)

Apicata, Sejanus’ erstwhile wife, may have been the daughter of the gourmand [[Marcus Gavius Apicius|Apicius]].  Rumours were also current that Sejanus had "sold his person to [that] wealthy debauchee” ([[Tacitus]], ''Annales'' IV.1).

== Sejanus in later literature ==
* [[Ben Jonson]] made the story into a 1603 play entitled ''[[Sejanus (play)|Sejanus, His Fall]]'', and an anonymous contemporary also covered him 4 years later, in the 1607 play ''The Tragedy of Claudius [[Tiberius]] Nero''.

* Sejanus was played by [[Patrick Stewart]] in the TV adaptation of [[Robert Graves]]'s book ''[[I, Claudius (TV series)|I, Claudius]]''.
 
* Sejanus is referenced heavily and met several times in the [[Marcus Corvinus]] series by [[David Wishart]].  The Fourth book Sejanus is the story of his fall from power and death.

* Sejanus was also featured in the video game "[[Spartan Total Warrior]]" as a villain who practiced dark magic.  Sejanus's rank and name were kept accurate. "Lucius Aelius Seianus, Praetorian prefect, at your service.  Or rather, at emperor Tiberius's service."

== Reference ==
Sejanus's fall from power and the aftermath are recounted in detail by ancient writers, notably the historians [[Dio Cassius]] (book LVIII) and [[Gaius Cornelius Tacitus|Tacitus]] ([[Annals]] book VI), and also by [[Satires of Juvenal|Juvenal]] in his tenth satire.  [[Josephus]] ([[Antiquities of the Jews]], Book 18, ch.6) is also invaluable.
