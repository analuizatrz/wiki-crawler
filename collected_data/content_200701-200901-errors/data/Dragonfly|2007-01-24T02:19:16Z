A '''dragonfly''' is any [[insect]] belonging to the order [[Odonata]], the suborder [[Epiprocta]] or, in the strict sense, the infraorder '''Anisoptera'''. It is characterized by large [[compound eye|multifaceted eyes]], two pairs of strong transparent [[insect wing|wings]], and an elongated body.

Dragonflies typically eat [[mosquito]]es, [[midge (insect)|midge]]s and other small insects like [[fly|flies]], [[bee]]s, and [[butterfly|butterflies]]. They are usually found around lakes, ponds, streams, and [[wetland]]s because their [[larva]]e, known as "[[nymph (biology)|nymph]]s", are aquatic. Dragonflies do not normally bite or sting humans (though they will bite in order to escape, for example, if grasped by the abdomen); in fact, they are valued as a [[predation|predator]] that helps control the populations of harmful insects, such as mosquitoes.

==Life cycle==
[[Image:Dragonfly_morphology_edit_3.svg|left|thumb|200px|Morphology and anatomy of a dragonfly]]

The life cycle of the dragonfly, from [[egg (biology)|egg]] to death of adult, varies from six months to as much as six or seven years. Female dragonflies lay eggs in or near water, often in or on floating or emergent plants. Most of the life cycle is spent in the [[larva]]l ([[naiad (biology)|naiad]], aka nymph) form, beneath the water surface, using internal [[gill]]s to breathe, and catching other [[invertebrate]]s or even vertebrates such as [[tadpole]]s and [[fish]]. In the adult (flying) stage, larger species of dragonfly can live as long as four months.

==General facts==
===Record breakers===
Much larger dragonfly species existed in the distant past than occur on earth today. The largest one, found as a [[fossil]], is an extinct [[Protodonata]] named ''[[Meganeura]] monyi'' from the [[Permian]] period with a [[wingspan]] of 70&ndash;75&nbsp;cm (27.5&ndash;29.5&nbsp;in). This compares to 19&nbsp;cm (7.5&nbsp;in) for the largest modern species of odonates, the [[Hawaiian Islands|Hawaiian]] endemic dragonfly, ''[[Anax strenuus]]''. The smallest modern species recorded is the libellulid dragonfly, ''[[Nannophya pygmaea]]'' from [[east Asia]] with a wingspan of only 20&nbsp;mm, or about ¾ of an inch.

Dragonflies are the world's fastest insects and, although estimates of their speed vary wildly, most credible authorities say they are capable of reaching speeds of between 30 and 60 [[kilometres per hour|km/h]] (19 to 38 [[miles per hour|mph]]).<ref>{{cite web| url=http://dragonflywebsite.com/faq.htm|accessdate=January 21|accessyear=2007|title=Dragonflies}}</ref> A study showed that dragonflies can travel as much as 137 km (85 mi) in one day.<ref>BBC. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4759615.stm "Tiny tags trace dragonfly paths"], [[10 May]] [[2006]]</ref>

===Vision===
Dragonflies have very good eyesight due to their eye structure. Dragonflies have up to 30,000 facets to their [[compound eye]]s; each one is a separate light-sensing organ or [[ommatidia|ommatidium]], arranged to give nearly a 360° field of vision.

===Camouflage===
It was recently discovered that dragonflies employ a particular [[optical illusion]], termed ''[[motion camouflage]]''<ref>{{cite web| url=http://info.anu.edu.au/MAC/Media/Media_Releases/_2003/_030605Dragonflies.asp|accessdate=June 18|accessyear=2006|title=Dragonflies prove clever predators}}</ref>, to stalk other insects that invade their territory. A dragonfly can move in such a way as to project itself as a stationary object while speedily attacking its victims, new research suggests. These findings illustrate for the first time how dragonflies use complex [[camouflage|camouflaging]] techniques during aerial combat.

==Classification==
===Ancient dragonflies ("Anisozygoptera")===
Conventionally, the Anisoptera were given suborder rank beside the ''ancient dragonflies'' ("Anisozygoptera", two living species and numerous fossil ones), but it has been determined recently that the Anisozygoptera form a [[paraphyly|paraphyletic]] assemblage of primitive relatives of the Anisoptera. Thus, the Anisoptera are reduced to an [[infraorder]], forming the new suborder Epiprocta (dragonflies in a general sense). The artificial grouping Anisozygoptera is disbanded, its members being recognized as largely extinct offshoots at various stages of dragonfly [[evolution]].

The oldest known dragonfly is the 320 million year old ''[[Delitzschala bitterfeldensis]]''. Another old genus is ''[[Namurotypus]]''.

===Dragonflies vs. damselflies===
[[Damselfly|Damselflies]] (Suborder Zygoptera) are often confused with dragonflies, but the two insects are distinct: most damselflies at rest hold their wings together above the body or held slightly open above (such as in the family Lestidae), whereas dragonflies at rest hold their wings horizontally or occasionally slightly down and forward. Also, the hindwing of the dragonfly broadens near the base, caudal to the connecting point at the body, while the hindwing of the damselfly is essentially similar to the forewing. The eyes on a damselfly are separated; in most dragonflies the eyes touch, with notable exceptions to this being in the Petaluridae (Petaltails) and the Gomphidae (Clubtails). Both are members of the Odonata, and their life cycles are similar.

*The [[Pokémon]] [[Yanma]] and its evolution [[Megayanma]] are based on the dragonfly, alongside with [[Vibrava]] (evolved form of [[Trapinch]]) and its evolved form [[Flygon]], who are also based on the [[antlion]].
*One of the Mavericks in ''[[Mega Man X6]]'' is Commander Yammark, a dragonfly Reploid.
*One of the symbols of the band [[Coheed and Cambria]] is a dragonfly. A dragonfly was one of the cover of their first album, ''[[The Second Stage Turbine Blade]]''.
