'''Education in England''' is the responsibility of parents<ref>[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1996/ukpga_19960056_en_2#pt1-ch1-pb3-l1g7 Education Act 1996 (Section 7)]</ref><ref>[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1996/ukpga_19960056_en_2#pt1-ch1-pb4-l1g9 Education Act 1996 (Section 9)]</ref><ref>[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1996/ukpga_19960056_en_35#pt10-ch6-pb6-l1g576 Education Act 1996 (Definition of  "parent")]</ref>.  Whilst full-time education is compulsory for all children aged between 5 and 16 (inclusive) parents are free to choose how to provide the education.  They may choose, for example, from state schools (which could include [[Voluntary aided school]]s and [[Church_school#England|Church schools]]), private [[Independent school (UK)|Independent schools]], [[Waldorf education|Waldorf schools]] or to educate their own children by any other suitable means<ref>http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Parents/Schoolslearninganddevelopment/YourChildsWelfareAtSchool/DG_066966</ref>.

The state run school system is overseen by the [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]];  further and higher education is covered by the [[Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills]]<ref>[http://www.dius.gov.uk/role.html DUS Our role]</ref>.  At a local level the [[Local government in England|local authorities]] take responsibility for implementing policy for [[public education]] and [[state school]]s.  

==The structure of the English educational system==
===Ages 5 to 16===
<center>[[Image:Diagram of UK School System 2.PNG]]</center>
The diagram represents the three most common patterns for schooling in the state sector in England with progression from primary to secondary levels at age 11, or with an intermediate middle level from age 9 to 13.

Children can be enrolled in the reception year in September of that school year thus beginning school at age 4 or 4.5. Unless the student chooses to stay within the education system school attendance ends on the last Friday in June during the academic year in which a student attains the age of 16.<ref>http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Parents/Schoolslearninganddevelopment/YourChildsWelfareAtSchool/DG_066966</ref>

====Primary school====
Primary education in England is most often conducted through [[Infant school|Infant]] and [[Junior school|Junior]] schools or a combined [[Primary school]]. 

* Part-time [[Foundation Stage]] 1 (in a pre-school/childcare environment)
**  Nursery, age 3 to 4

* Full-time [[Foundation Stage]] 2 (in an Infant or Primary school)
**  Reception, age 4 to 5 (Start of compulsory education)

* [[Key Stage 1]] (in an Infant, First or Primary school)
**  [[Year One (school)|Year 1]], age 5 to 6 
**  [[Year Two|Year 2]], age 6 to 7

*  [[Key Stage 2]] (in Junior, Middle or Primary school)
**  [[Year Three|Year 3]], age 7 to 8
**  [[Year Four|Year 4]], age 8 to 9
**  [[Year Five (school)|Year 5]], age 9 to 10
**  [[Year Six|Year 6]], age 10 to 11

====Secondary school====
[[Image:Wetherbyhighschool.jpg|thumb|right|240px|[[Wetherby High School]], a typical former [[secondary modern]] school in [[Wetherby]], [[West Yorkshire]]]]

Secondary education in England most often takes place in [[secondary school]]s which cover the two secondary [[key stage]]s:

* [[Key Stage 3]]
** [[Year 7]], age 11 to 12
** [[Year 8]], age 12 to 13
** [[Year 9]], age 13 to 14 
* [[Key Stage 4]]
** [[Year 10]], age 14 to 15
** [[Year 11]], age 15 to 16 (end of compulsory education)

Many secondary schools make provision for post-compulsory study through [[sixth form]] departments.
*[[Year 12]], age 16 to 17
*[[Year 13]], age 17 to 18

Historically, years 7 to 12/13 used to be known as 'first form' to 'lower/upper sixth form'. There now exists a common parallel terminology for sixth form only: 'year 12/lower 6th' and 'year 13/upper 6th'. The use of the term 'sixth form' reflects its distinct, voluntary nature and situation as the [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-level]] years.  Even more historically, this arose from the system in [[public schools]], where all forms were divided into Lower, Upper, and sometimes Middle sections.  Year 7 is equivalent to 'Upper Third Form', Year 8 would have been known as 'Lower Fourth', and so on.

====Education otherwise than by schooling====
The Education Act requires parents to ensure their children are educated either by attending school or otherwise.  Increasing numbers of parents are choosing the otherwise option<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/rising-number-of-parents-decide-they-can-do-a-better-job-than-the-education-system-671478.html Independent news story]</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/4362145.stm BBC News story]</ref><ref>[http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/society/education/uk+homeschool+cases+soar/847157 Channel 4 news story]</ref>   This style of education is often referred to as Elective Home Education<ref>[http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/localauthorities/index.cfm?action=content&contentID=11357&subjectID=7&subsubjectID=145 DCSF - Elective home education]</ref>.  The education can take many different forms<ref>Free Range Education, Dowty (Editor), Hawthorn Press, ISBN 1903458072</ref> ranging from [[Home_schooling#United_Kingdom|homeschooling]] where a school style curriculum is followed at home to [[unschooling]] where any semblance of structure in the educational provision is abandoned.  Parents do not need permission to educate their own children. There is no requirement to follow the National Curriculum or to give formal lessons. Parents do not need to be qualified teachers, or to follow school hours or terms.<ref>[http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Parents/Schoolslearninganddevelopment/ChoosingASchool/DG_4016124 Educating your child at home]</ref>

====Examinations and assessments====
Under the [[National Curriculum]] system, all pupils undergo a series of tests at specific points in their education. These are known as Key Stage [[National Curriculum assessment|National Curriculum Tests]] and are numbered 1 to 4 as follows:
 
* [[Key Stage 1]] (KS1) — during Year 2 (ages 6/7)
* [[Key Stage 2]] (KS2) — towards the end of Year 6 (ages 10/11)
* [[Key Stage 4]] (KS4) — during both Year 10 and 11, mostly at the end of Year 11 (ages 14-16) — incorporated into [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSE]] examinations

The [[Key Stage 3]] (KS3) tests, which formerly used to happen towards the end of Year 9 (ages 13/14), were eliminated after the 2008 tests, when severe problems emerged concerning the marking procedures.

These Key Stage exams are also often referred to as [[National Curriculum assessment|SATs]] (Standard Assessment Tests).

Pupils wishing to progress in to a [[grammar school]] need to sit an additional exam, usually called the [[Eleven plus]]. The availability of grammar schools is limited by geographical location. Most areas of England no longer have grammar schools in the publicly-funded system, but there may be [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|Independent Schools]] available in the area which offer a grammar school education.

====School attendance====
If registered with a state school  attendance is compulsory beginning with the term following the child's 5th birthday.  Children can be enrolled in the reception year in September of that school year thus beginning school at age 4 or 4.5. Compulsory school attendance ends on the last Friday in June during the academic year in which a pupil attains the age of 16.<ref>http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Parents/Schoolslearninganddevelopment/YourChildsWelfareAtSchool/DG_066966</ref> It is expected that by 2013 students will be required to continue to receive some form of education or training until the age of 18.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6254833.stm</ref>.

===Post 16 education===
[[Image:ShrewsburySixthFormCollege.JPG|250px|thumb|right|[[Shrewsbury Sixth Form College]] in [[Shropshire]].]]
Both state schools and independent schools take the [[GCSE]] examinations, which mark the end of compulsory education.  Above school leaving age, the independent and state sectors are similarly structured. 
In the 16-18 age group, "sixth-form" education is not compulsory. 

====Further education====
Students will typically study in either the Sixth Form of a School, a [[Sixth form college]], or a [[further education college]].
These courses can also be studied by adults over 18. This sector is referred to as [[Further Education]]. All 16-18 students are encouraged (this is only mandatory in some institutions) to study [[Key Skills Qualification|Key Skills]] in Communication, Application of Number and Information Technology.

====Higher education====
[[Image:KingsCollegeChapelWest.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The chapel of [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]], [[Cambridge University]].]]
Students normally enter [[University]] from 18 onwards and study for an [[Academic Degree]].  Apart from [[University of Buckingham|a single private university]], all undergraduate education is largely state financed (with tuition fees set at a maximum index-linked £3,145 per year, repayable after graduation contingent on attaining a certain level of income, and with the state paying all fees for students from the poorest backgrounds), and UK students are generally entitled to [[student loan]]s for maintenance. The state does not control syllabuses, but it does influence admission procedures. Unlike most degrees, the state still has control over [[teacher training]] courses, and uses [[Ofsted]] inspectors to maintain standards.<ref>http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/portal/site/Internet/menuitem.1c8478149b4a6342502b011069f034a0/?event=searchByProviderType&maxResultPerPage=10&currentPage=1&sortOrder=1&providerCategoryID=16777216</ref>

The typical [[first degree]] offered at British universities is the [[Bachelor's degree]] (typically three years). Many institutions now offer an undergraduate [[Master's degree]] as a first degree, typically lasting four years. During a [[first degree]] students are known as [[undergraduate]]s. The difference in fees between [[undergraduate]] and traditional [[postgraduate]] Master's degrees (and the possibility of securing LEA funding for the former) makes taking an undergraduate [[Master's degree]] as a [[first degree]] a more attractive option, although the novelty of undergraduate Master's degrees means that the relative educational merit of the two is currently unclear.

Some universities offer a vocationally-based [[Foundation degree]], typically two years in length for those students who hope to continue to take a [[first degree]] but wish to remain in employment.

=====Postgraduate education=====
Students who have completed a [[first degree]] are eligible to undertake a [[postgraduate]] degree, which includes:

* [[Master's degree]] (typically taken in one year)
* [[Doctorate|Doctorate degree]] (typically taken in three years)

Postgraduate education is not automatically financed by the State, and so admission is in practice highly competitive.

=====Specialist qualifications=====
* Education: [[Postgraduate Certificate in Education]] (PGCE), [[Certificate in Education]] (Cert Ed), [[City and Guilds of London Institute|C&G]] 7407 or [[Bachelor of Education]] (BA or BEd), most of which also incorporate [[Qualified Teacher Status]] ([[QTS]]).
* Law: [[Bachelor of Laws]] LL.B. 
* Medicine: [[Bachelors of Medicine and Surgery]] studied at [[Medical school (United Kingdom)]]
* Business: [[Master of Business Administration]] MBA.

===Adult education===
[[Adult education]], [[Continuing education]] or [[Lifelong learning]] is offered to students of all ages. These can include the vocational qualifications mentioned above and also:
* [[Access programme]] one or two year courses to allow adults access to university.
* [[Open University]] a distance learning program which can result in a Degree.
* [[Workers' Educational Association]]
A large number of semi-recreational courses, with or without qualifications, are made available by Local Education Authorities under the guise of Adult Education, such as holiday languages, crafts and yacht navigation.

===Fees===
As the costs of financing the state run school system are met through [[tax]]ation there are no fees payable for education at state schools or colleges up to the age of 19.   Schools are allowed to levy charges for activities such as swimming, theatre visits, field trips provided the charges are voluntary thus ensuring that thoise who cannot afford to pay are allowed to participate in such events. 

Education at privately run [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|independent schools]] is usually chargeable. Such schools, some of which are [[boarding schools]], cover primary and secondary education and charge between £3000 to £30000 per year{{Fact|date=November 2008}}.  Some schools offer scholarships for those with particular skills or aptitudes or [[bursary|bursaries]] to allow less well-off students to attend.  Parents who choose to educate their own children otherwise than at school have to finance the education provision themselves. 

Undergraduates pay up to £3000 per annum (capped) in [[top-up fees]] and Postgraduates typically pay £3000 per annum however some institutions charge more.  There are numerous bursaries (awarded to low income applicants) to offset the undergraduate fees, and for postgraduates, full scholarships are available for most subjects which are awarded competitively.  Differing arrangements apply to English students studying in [[Education in Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Education in Scotland|Scottish]] / [[Education in Wales|Welsh]] students studying in England.  Non UK students at English universities are charged differing amounts, often in the region of £5000 - £20000 per annum{{Fact|date=November 2008}} for undergraduate and postgraduate degrees. The actual amount differs by institution and subject with the lab based subjects charging a greater amount.

==The history of state-sponsored education in England==
{{main|History of education in England}}

=== The period before 1950 ===

*From medieval times, the Church (or chapel) provided education to all classes of society - in monasteries, at public schools, orphanages, charity schools, grammar schools, church foundations, or by the chaplains to private households. Until as late as the nineteenth century, all university fellows and many schoolmasters were  expected or required to be in holy orders. Schoolmistresses typically taught "the three Rs" (reading, writing and 'rithmatic) in dame schools, charity schools, or informal village schools. The Church of England resisted early attempts for the state to provide secular education, and [[National school|church schools]] still are an integral part of the state school system.

*In August 1833, the [[parliament of the United Kingdom|UK parliament]] voted sums of money each year for the construction of schools for poor children, the first time the state had become involved with education in England and Wales,  whereas the programme of universal [[education in Scotland]] began in 1561.

*A meeting in [[Manchester]] in 1837, chaired by [[Mark Philips]], led to the creation of the [[Lancashire Public Schools' Association]]. The association proposed that non-denominational schools should be funded from local [[tax]]es.

*In 1839 [[government]] grants for the construction and maintenance of schools were switched to voluntary bodies, and became conditional on a satisfactory inspection.

*In 1840 the ''Grammar Schools [[Act of Parliament|Act]]'' expanded the [[Grammar School]] curriculum from classical studies to include [[science]] and [[literature]].

*Before 1870, education was largely a private affair, with wealthy parents sending their children to fee-paying schools, and others using whatever local teaching was made available.

*The Forster ''[[Elementary Education Act 1870]]'' required partially state funded [[board school]]s to be set up to provide primary (elementary) education in areas where existing provision was inadequate.  Board schools were managed by elected school boards. The schools remained fee-paying.  The previous government grant scheme established in 1833 ended on December 31, 1870.

*Under the  ''[[Elementary Education Act 1880]]'', education became compulsory from the ages of 5 to 10.

*The  ''[[Free Education Act 1891]]'' provided for the state payment of school fees up to ten [[shilling]]s per week.

*The  ''[[Elementary Education (School Attendance) Act 1893]]'' raised the school leaving age to 11 and later to 13.  The ''Elementary Education (Blind and Deaf Children) Act'' of the same year extended compulsory education to [[blindness|blind]] and [[deaf]] children, and made provision for the creation of [[special school]]s.

*The ''[[Voluntary Schools Act 1897]]''  provided grants to public [[elementary school]]s not funded by school boards (typically Church schools).

*From April 1900 [[higher elementary school]]s were recognised, providing education from the age of 10 to 15.

*The 'Balfour' ''[[Education Act 1902]] '' created [[local education authority|local education authorities]] (LEAs), who took over responsibility for [[board school]]s from the school boards.  Grammar schools also became funded by the LEA. The act was of particular significance as it allowed for all schools, including denominational schools, to be funded through rates (local taxation).

*The Fisher ''[[Education Act 1918]]'' made [[secondary education]] compulsory up to age 14 and gave responsibility for secondary schools to the state.  Under the Act, many higher elementary schools and endowed [[grammar school]] sought to become state funded [[central school]]s or [[secondary school]]s. However, most children attended primary (elementary) school up until age 14, rather than going to a separate school for secondary education.

*After the passing of the 1929 ''[[Local Government Act]]'', [[Poor Law school]]s became state funded [[elementary school]]s.

*The [[Education Act 1944|Butler Education Act]] of 1944 established the [[Tripartite System]], and defined the modern split between Primary and Secondary education at age 11.

*Education was made compulsory up to age 15 in 1947.

=== The post-war period ===

Due to the perceived failures of the Tripartite system, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government in 1965 requested proposals from all the UK's regions for them to move from the Tripartite system to the [[Comprehensive System]]. Note that this was an optional reform for the regions, and some regions still have the Tripartite System. 

In 1972, education was made compulsory up to age 16. A generation of "[[ROSLA]]" (Raising Of the School Leaving Age) children caused significant problems for teachers.{{Fact|date=January 2008}}

Following the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 General Election]], the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] party regained power in central government, and made two main changes in this period:

# [[New Vocationalism]] was expanded (Labour had made some small efforts beforehand, but the Conservatives expanded it considerably).  This was seen as an effort to reduce the high youth unemployment, which was regarded as one of the causes of the sporadic [[riot]]ing at the end of the seventies.
# The [[Assisted Places Scheme]] was introduced in 1980, whereby gifted children who could not afford to go to fee-paying schools would be given free places in those schools if they could pass the school's entrance exam.

=== The Education Reform Act of 1988 ===

The 1988 Education Reform Act made considerable changes to the education system.  These changes were aimed at creating a 'market' in education with schools competing with each other for 'customers' (pupils). The theory was that bad schools would lose pupils to the good schools and either have to improve, reduce in capacity or close.

The reforms included the following:

* The [[National Curriculum]] was introduced, which made it compulsory for schools to teach certain subjects and syllabi. Previously the choice of subjects had been up to the school.
* [[National curriculum assessment]]s were introduced at the Key Stages 1 to 4 (ages 7, 11, 14 and 16 respectively) through what were formerly called [[Standard Assessment Tests|SATS]] (Standard Assessment Tests). At Key Stage 4 (age 16), the assessments were made from the [[GCSE]] exam.
* [[League tables]] began showing ''performance'' statistics for each school. These are regularly published in newspapers and [http://www.dfes.gov.uk/performancetables/ are available] over the web, so parents can see how schools are doing in each area of the country.
* [[Formula funding]] was introduced, which meant that the more children a school could attract to it, the more money it got.
* Open Enrolment and choice for parents were brought back, so that parents could choose or influence which school their children went to.
* Schools could, if enough of their pupils' parents agreed, opt out of local government control, becoming [[grant maintained school]]s and receiving funding direct from central government. The government offered more money than the school would get usually from the local authority as an enticement. This was seen as a political move given that often local authorities were not run by the governing [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] whereas central government was.

=== New Labour's educational policies from 1997 ===

During the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 General Election]], the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] party mantra was "Education, Education, Education", a reference to their conference slogan. Winning the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|election]] returned them to power, but [[New Labour]]'s political ideology meant that many of the changes introduced by the Conservatives during their time in power remained intact.

They began changing the structure of the school and higher education systems. The following changes took place:

* The previous Labour focus on the Comprehensive system was shifted to a focus on tailoring education to each child's ability.  Critics see this as reminiscent of the original intentions of the Tripartite system.
* Grant-maintained status was abolished, with GM schools being given the choice of rejoining the local authority as a maintained community school, or becoming a [[Foundation school]].
* Labour expanded a policy started by the Conservatives of creating [[specialist school]]s. This new type of secondary school teaches the National Curriculum subjects plus a few specialist branches of knowledge (e.g. business studies) not found in most other schools.  These schools are allowed to select 10% of their pupils.
** Numbers: In 1997 there were 196 of these schools.  In August 2002 there were 1000.  By 2006 the plan is to have 2000, and the goal is to make all secondary schools specialist eventually.
* The [[Beacon Schools programme]] was established in England in 1998. Its aim was to identify high performing schools, in order to help them form partnerships with each other and to provide examples of effective practice for other schools. The programme was replaced in August 2005 with more broadly based programmes; the [[Leading Edge Partnership]] programme (for secondary schools) and [[Primary Strategy Learning Networks]] (PSLNs) (at the primary level).<ref name=programme>[http://www.standards.dfes.gov.uk/beaconschools/ Department for Education and Skills Website, Beacon Schools page.]  Accessed 2007-04-14.</ref>
* A new grade of Advanced Skills Teachers was created, with the intention that highly skilled teachers would be paid more if they accepted new posts with outreach duties beyond their own schools. 
* City Academies were introduced. These are new schools, built on the site of, or taking over from existing failing schools. A [[city academy]] is an independent school within the state system. It is outside the control of the local education authority and set up with substantial funding from interested third parties, which might be businesses, charities or private individuals.
* [[Education Action Zones]] were introduced, which are deprived areas run by an action forum of people within that area with the intention of making that area's schools better. 
* Vocational qualifications were renamed/restructured as follows:
** GNVQs became Vocational GCSEs and AVCEs.
** NVQs scope expanded so that a degree-equivalent NVQ was possible.
* The [[New Deal (UK)|New Deal]] was introduced, which made advisors available to long-term unemployed (in the UK this is defined as being unemployed for more than 6 months) to give help and money to those who want to go back into Education.
* Introduced Literacy and [[Numeracy]] Hours into schools, and set targets for literacy and numeracy.
* Set Truancy targets.
* Set a maximum class size of 30 for 5-7 year olds.
* Introduced the EMA, (Education Maintenance Allowance), which is paid to those between 16 and 18 as an enticement to remain in full-time education and get A-Levels/AVCEs.
* A Performance Threshold was introduced in 2000 to allow experienced teachers access to  higher rates of pay on meeting a set of performance standards, including a standard of pupil attainment. The performance-related pay changes have been bitterly opposed by teaching unions, most notably the [[National Union of Teachers]] which challenged the Threshold scheme by legal action. 
* Introduced [[Curriculum 2000]], which reformed the Further Education system into the current structure of AS levels, A2 levels and Key Skills.
* Abolished the [[Assisted Places Scheme]].
* A report was commissioned, led by the former chief-inspector of schools, [[Mike Tomlinson]], into reform of the curriculum and qualifications structure for 14&ndash;19 year-olds.  The report was published on 18 October 2004 and recommended the introduction of a diploma that would bring together both vocational and academic qualifications and ensure that all pupils had a basic set of core skills.  It is proposed that the current qualifications would evolve into this diploma over the next decade, whether the government will follow the recommendations is yet to be seen &mdash; the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] have already introduced alternative proposals to return to norm-referencing in A-levels rather than the current system of criterion-referencing.

* In 2003 a green paper entitled ''[[Every Child Matters]]'' was published. It built on existing plans to strengthen children's services and focused on four key areas:
** Increasing the focus on supporting families and careers as the most critical influence on children's lives
** Ensuring necessary intervention takes place before children reach crisis point and protecting children from falling through the net
** Addressing the underlying problems identified in the report into the death of [[Victoria Climbié]] - weak accountability and poor integration
** Ensuring that the people working with children are valued, rewarded and trained

: The green paper prompted a wide debate about services for children, young people and families. There followed a wide consultation with those working in children's services, and with parents, children and young people. The Government published ''Every Child Matters: the Next Steps'' in November 2004, and passed the [[Children Act 2004]], providing the legislative spine for developing more effective and accessible services focused around the needs of children, young people and families.

* In January 2007 [[Education Secretary]] [[Alan Johnson]] announced plans to extend the school leaving age in England to eighteen by 2013. This would raise the leaving age for the first time since the last raise in 1972, when compulsory education was extended until sixteen. This change will include training such as [[apprenticeship]]s and work based training rather than exclusively offering continued academic learning.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6254833.stm School leaving age set to be eighteen] BBC News, retrieved 12 January 2007</ref>

==Categories of schools==

There are 4 main types of maintained school in England:

* Community
* Foundation
* Voluntary Aided
* Voluntary Controlled

In 1998 these replaced the previous categories of state school: county, voluntary controlled, special agreement, voluntary aided and grant-maintained (GM).

Schools in all the categories have a lot in common. They work in partnership with other schools and the [[Local Education Authority|LEAs]], and they receive funding from [[Local Education Authority|LEA]] and they have to deliver the national curriculum. Each category has its own characteristics.

===Community schools===

In [[community school]]s (formerly county schools), the [[Local Education Authority|LEA]] employs the schools' staff, own the schools' lands and buildings and have primary responsibility for deciding the arrangements for admitting pupils. In such schools, all teachers are employed under the nationally-agreed [[School Teachers' Pay and Conditions Document]].

===Foundation schools===

In [[foundation school]]s the governing body employs the staff and has primary responsibility for admissions. The school land and buildings are owned by the governing body or by a charitable foundation. Many of these schools were formerly grant maintained schools. The Foundation appoints the majority of [[School governors|governors]]. In 2005 the Labour government proposed allowing all schools to become Foundation schools if they wished.

===Voluntary aided (VA) schools===
[[Image:StBarnabasCoEPrimarySchoolOxford.jpg|thumb|right|St Barnabas Church of England Primary School, Oxford]]
[[Voluntary aided school]]s can be linked to a variety of organisations. They can be faith schools (often the [[Church of England]] or the [[Roman Catholic Church]]), or be non-denominational schools, often linked to London [[Livery Companies]] such as the Worshipful Companies of [[Worshipful Company of Haberdashers|Haberdashers]], [[Worshipful Company of Skinners|Skinners]] and [[Worshipful Company of Drapers|Drapers]]. The [[School governors|governing body]] contributes towards the capital costs of running the school and employs the staff and decides admission arrangements. The schools' lands and buildings are normally owned by the charitable foundation.

===Voluntary controlled (VC) schools===

[[Voluntary controlled school]]s are almost always church schools, and the lands and buildings are often owned by a charitable foundation. However, the [[Local Education Authority|LEA]] employ the schools' staff and has primary responsibility for admission arrangements.
