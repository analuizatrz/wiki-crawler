'''''Press Gang''''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] children's [[television]] [[comedy-drama]] consisting of forty-three episodes across five series that were broadcast from [[1989 in television|1989]] to [[1993 in television|1993]]. It was produced by Richmond Film & Television for [[Central Independent Television|Central]], and screened on the [[ITV]] network in its regular weekday afternoon children's strand, ''[[CiTV|Children's ITV]]''.<ref name="newtonm">{{cite web |first=Matthew |last=Newton|title=Press Gang - An episode guide by Matthew Newton |url=http://www.mjnewton.demon.co.uk/tv/pgmain.htm |accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref>

Aimed at older children and teenagers, the programme was based around the activities of a children's newspaper, the ''Junior Gazette'', produced by pupils from the local [[comprehensive school]]. In later series it would be depicted as a commercial venture. The show interspersed comedic elements with the dramatic. As well as addressing [[interpersonal relationship]]s (particularly in the Lynda-Spike [[story arc]]), the show tackled issues such as [[solvent abuse]], [[child abuse]] and [[firearm]]s control.<ref>[[Paul Cornell]] (1993) "Press Gang" In: {{cite book |last= Cornell |first= Paul. |coauthors= [[Martin Day]], [[Keith Topping]] |title= The Guinness Book of Classic British TV |publisher=Guinness |year= 1993 |pages=215-8 |id=ISBN 0-85112-543-3}}</ref>

Written by ex-teacher [[Steven Moffat]], over half of the episodes were directed by [[Bob Spiers]], a noted [[British comedy]] director who had previously worked on classics such as ''[[Fawlty Towers]]''. Critical reception was very positive, particularly for the quality of its writing,  and has attracted a [[cult following]] with a wide age range.<ref name="newtonm"/>

==Storyline==
{{main|List of Press Gang episodes}}
Famous journalist Matt Kerr ([[Clive Wood]]) arrives from [[Fleet Street]] to edit the local newspaper. He sets up a junior version of the paper, ''The Junior Gazette'', to be produced by pupils from the local [[comprehensive school]] before and after school hours.<ref name="newtons1">{{cite web|first=Matthew|last=Newton|title=Press Gang: Season One|work=Newton's Laws of TV |url=http://www.mjnewton.demon.co.uk/tv/pgang1.htm|accessdate=2006-12-19}}</ref>

Some of the team are "star pupils". However, some members have reputations of delinquency. One such pupil, Spike Thompson ([[Dexter Fletcher]]) is forced to work on the paper rather than being expelled from school. He is immediately attracted to editor Lynda Day ([[Julia Sawalha]]), but they bicker, throwing [[one-liner joke|one-liner]]s at each other. Their relationship develops and they have an on-off relationship.<ref name="newtons2">{{cite web |first=Matthew |last=Newton |title=Press Gang: Season Two |work=Newton's Laws of TV |url=http://www.mjnewton.demon.co.uk/tv/pgang2.htm |accessdate=2006-12-19}}</ref> They regularly discuss their feelings, especially in the concluding episodes of each series. In the final episode for the third series, "Holding On", Spike unwittingly expresses his strong feelings to Lynda whilst being taped.<ref name="holdingon">{{cite episode |title=Holding On |series=Press Gang |credits=wr.

Although the Lynda and Spike [[story arc]] runs throughout the series, most episodes feature self-contained stories and sub-plots.  Amongst lighter stories, such as one about Colin accidentally attending a funeral dressed as a pink rabbit, the show tackled many serious issues. Jeff Evans, writing in the ''Guinness Television Encyclopedia'', writes that the series adopts a "far more adult approach" than "previous efforts in the same vein" such as ''[[A Bunch of Fives]].'' Some critics also compared it with ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'', ''[[Lou Grant (TV series)|Lou Grant]]'' "and other thoughtful US dramas, thanks to its realism and its level headed treatment of touchy subjects."<ref name="evans">{{cite book |first=Jeff |last=Evans |title=The Guinness Television Encyclopedia |publisher=Guinness|year=1995 |pages =423 |isbn= 0851127444}}</ref> The first series approached [[solvent abuse]] in "How To Make A Killing", and the [[NSPCC]] assisted in the production of the "[[Something Terrible]]" episodes about [[child abuse]].<ref>{{cite episode |title=Something Terrible: Part 2 |series=Press Gang |credits=wr.

According to the [[British Film Institute]], "''Press Gang'' managed to be perhaps the funniest children's series ever made and at the same time the most painfully raw and emotionally honest. The tone could change effortlessly and sensitively from farce to tragedy in the space of an episode."<ref name="screenonline">{{cite web |first=Alistair |last=McGown |title=Press Gang (1989-93) |work=BFI Screenonline |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/571944/index.html |accessdate=2006-12-21}}</ref> Although the series is sometimes referred to as a comedy, Moffat insists that it is a drama with jokes in it. The writer recalls "a long running argument with Geoff Hogg (film editor on ''Press Gang'') about whether ''Press Gang'' was comedy. He insisted that it was and I said it wasn't - it was just funny."<ref>{{cite web |title="POSITIVE COMEDY" Graham Kibble-White talks to Steven Moffat |url=http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/interviews/stevenmoffat.htm |work=Off the Telly |date=March 2001 |accessdate=2007-05-11}}</ref> Some innuendo leads Moffat to claim that it "had the dirtiest jokes in history, we got away with tons of stuff ...

Steven Moffat |network=ITV |airdate=1991-03-21 |season=3 |number=3}}</ref>

Jeff Evans also comments that the series was filmed cinematically, dabbling "in dream sequences, flashbacks, fantasies and, on one-occasion, a ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]''-esque parody of the film ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]''."<ref name="evans"/><ref name="daydreams">{{cite episode |title=Day Dreams |series=Press Gang |credits=wr. Steven Moffat, dir. Bob Spiers |network=ITV |airdate=1992-02-11 |season=4 |number=6}}</ref> The show had a strong awareness of continuity, with some stories, incidents and minor characters referred to throughout the series. Actors who played short-term characters in the first two series were invited back to reprise their roles in future episodes.  David Jefford (Alex Crockett) was resurrected from 1989's "Monday - Tuesday" to appear in the final episode "[[There Are Crocodiles]]",<ref name="tac"/> while the same actress (Aisling Flitton) who played a wrong number in "Love and the Junior Gazette"<ref name="love"/> was invited to reprise her character for the third season episode "Chance is a Fine Thing."<ref name="chance"/>  "Attention to detail" such as this is, according to [[Paul Cornell]], "one of the numerous ways that the series respects the intelligence of its viewers."<ref>Cornell, p. 217</ref>

After the team leaves school, the paper gains financial independence and runs commercially. Assistant editor Kenny ([[Lee Ross (actor)|Lee Ross]]), leaves at the end of series three to be replaced by Julie ([[Lucy Benjamin]]), who was the head of the graphics team in season one.

==Production==
===Inception===
Bill Moffat, a headmaster from [[Glasgow]], had an idea for a children's television programme called ''The Norbridge Files''.<ref>Stephen O'Brien and Jim Sangster {{cite web|title=The Norbridge Files|work=Off the Telly|url=http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/childrens/pressgang.htm|date=February 2000|accessdate=2006-12-19}}</ref> He showed it to a producer who came to his school when it was used as the location for [[Harry Secombe]]'s ''[[Highway (TV series)|Highway]]''.<ref name="herring">{{cite web |title=Interview With Steven Moffat for the Guardian Guide |work=richardherring.com |url=http://www.richardherring.com/press/press.php?id=10 |date=1997 |accessdate=2007-05-11}}</ref> Producer [[Sandra C. Hastie]] liked the idea and showed it to Bill Ward, of Richmond Films and Television. When she requested a script, Moffat suggested that his 25-year old son, Steven, an English teacher, should write it. Hastie said that it was "the best ever first script" that she had read.<ref>Cornell, p 215</ref> 

All 43 episodes were written by Steven Moffat. During production of series two, he was having an unhappy personal life after the break-up of his first marriage. His wife's new lover was represented in the episode "The Big Finish?" by the character Brian Magboy ([[Simon Schatzberger]]), a name inspired by Brian: Maggie's boy. Moffat brought in the character so that all sorts of unfortunate things would happen to him, such as having a [[typewriter]] dropped on his foot.<ref name="big finish">Steven Moffat & Julia Sawalha, "The Big Finish?" ''Press Gang: Season 2'' DVD audio commentary</ref> This period in Moffat's life would also be reflected in his sitcom ''[[Joking Apart]]''.<ref>''Joking Apart: Season 1'' DVD audio commentary, and featurette</ref>

Central had confidence in the project, so rather than the show being shot at their studios in [[Nottingham]] as planned, they granted Richmond a £2 million budget. This enabled it to be shot on [[16mm film]], rather than the regular, less expensive [[videotape]], and [[Filming location|on location]], making it very expensive compared to most children's television.<ref name="putp">O'Brien, Stephen. "Picking up the Pieces" ''Breakfast at Czar's'' Issue 1. [Available as a PDF file on the ''Press Gang'' Series 2 DVD]</ref> These high production costs almost lead to its cancellation at the end of the second series, by which time Central executive Lewis Rudd was unable to commission programmes by himself.<ref name="big finish"/>

===Directors===
Over half of the episodes were directed by [[Bob Spiers]], a noted British comedy director who had previously worked on ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'' amongst many other programmes. He would work again with Moffat on his sitcom ''[[Joking Apart]]'' and ''[[Murder Most Horrid]]'', and with Sawalha on ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]''. According to Moffat, Spiers was the "principle director" taking an interest in the other episodes and setting the visual style of the show. Spiers particularly used [[tracking shot]]s, sometimes requiring more dialogue to be written to accommodate the length of the shot. The other directors would come in and "do a Spiers".<ref name="Moffcomm"/> All of the directors were encouraged to attend the others' shoots so that the visual style would be consistent.<ref name="hastie">"Interface: Sandra Hastie, part 2" ''Breakfast at Czar's'' Issue 2. [Available as a PDF file on the ''Press Gang'' Series 5 DVD]</ref>

The first two episodes were directed by [[Colin Nutley]]. However, he was unhappy with the final edit and requested that his name be removed from the credits.<ref name="newtons1"/><ref name="petford">{{cite web |first=Adrian |last=Petford |title=Press Gang - The Complete Series Guide |url=http://www.yoyo.org/pressgang/pgguide.txt |date=[[1995-12-16]] |accessdate=2006-12-19}}</ref> Lorne Magory directed many episodes, notably the two-part stories "How To Make A Killing"<ref name="htmak">{{cite episode |title=How to Make a Killing |series=Press Gang |credits=wr.

===Location===
Whilst the show was set in the fictional town of Norbridge, it was mostly filmed in [[Uxbridge, London|Uxbridge]], a suburb of [[London]].<ref name="moffint"/>  The first series was filmed entirely on location, but after the demolition of the building used as the original newspaper office, interior shots were filmed in [[Pinewood Studios]] for the second series, and the exterior of the building wasn't seen beyond that series.  Subsequent series were filmed at [[Shepperton Studios|Lee International Studios]] at [[Shepperton]] (series three and four) and [[Twickenham Studios]] (series five).<ref name="petford"/>

===Music and title sequences===
[[Image:Press Gang - Juila Sawalha caption.jpg|thumb|Julia Sawalha as Lynda Day, in the opening titles used in the first two series]]
The [[theme music]] was composed by Peter Davis, John Mealing and John G. Perry.<ref name="petford"/> The opening titles show the main characters striking a pose, with the name of the respective actor in a typewriter style typeface. Moffat says that if the credits look "cheesy" now, they also did back in 1989.<ref name="Moffcomm"/> They were re-recorded for series three, in the same style, to address the actors' ages and alterations to the set.

Many of the closing titles in the first two series were accompanied by dialogue from two characters. Episodes that ended on a particularly sombre tone, such as "Monday-Tuesday"<ref name="m-t">{{cite episode |title=Monday-Tuesday |series=Press Gang |credits=wr. Steven Moffat, dir. Bob Spiers |network=ITV |airdate=1989-04-03 |season=1 |number=11}}</ref> and "Yesterday's News",<ref>{{cite episode |title=Yesterday's News |series=Press Gang |credits=wr. Steven Moffat, dir. Lorne Magory |network=ITV |airdate=1990-03-29 |season=2 |number=11}}</ref> used only appropriately sombre music to accompany the end credits. After an emphatic climax, "At Last a Dragon" used an enhanced version of the main theme with more extravagant use of electric guitar. Moffat felt that the voiceovers worked well in the first season, but that they were not as good in the second. Hastie recalls that Moffat was "extremely angry" that ''[[Drop the Dead Donkey]]'' had adopted the style. They were dropped after the second series.<ref name="hastie"/> The cast, according to Moffat, were "grumpy with having to turn up to a recording studio to record them."<ref>Steven Moffat & Julia Sawalha  "At Last a Dragon" ''Press Gang: Season 2'' DVD audio commentary</ref>

==Characters==
===Main characters===
'''Lynda Day''' ([[Julia Sawalha]]) is the editor of the ''Junior Gazette''. She is strong and opinionated, and is feared by many of her team. Moffat has said that the character was partly based on the show's "ball-breaking" producer, Sandra C. Hastie.<ref name="Moffcomm"/><ref name="bbcreviews2">{{cite web|title=Review: Press Gang DVD |work=BBC - Cult Television |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/news/cult/2004/07/08/12781.shtml |date=[[2004-07-08]] |accessdate=2006-12-22}}</ref> In the 2007 [[BBC Four]] series ''Children's TV on Trial'', journalist [[Johann Hari]] says that Lynda is "very much a product of the 1980s ... a woman in charge who's brittle, very fierce, has no power of [[empathy]], is very cruel to the people around her."<ref name="hari">Johann Hair {{cite episode | title=1980s |series =Children's TV on Trial | credits = | network=BBC Four |airdate=2007-07-14}}</ref>

<blockquote>The consequences of Lynda's complete lack of compassion and her cruelty, how it effects the people around her, and how it eventually leads to her own destruction and death ... anyone who knows anything about Britain in the [[1980s]] can see some pretty clear parallels with our own [[Margaret Thatcher|Prime Minister]].<ref name="hari"/></blockquote>

Although she appears very tough, she occasionally exposes her feelings. She quits the paper at the end of "Monday-Tuesday", and in "Day Dreams" laments "Why do I get everything in my whole stupid life wrong?"<ref name="daydreams"/> Intimidated by socialising, she [[hiccup]]s at the idea. She is so nervous at a [[cocktail party]], in "At Last a Dragon",<ref>{{cite episode |title=At Last a Dragon |series=Press Gang |credits=wr. Steven Moffat, dir. Bob Spiers |network=ITV |airdate=1990-02-22 |season=2 |number=6}}</ref> that she attempts to leave on several occasions. The mixture of Lynda's sensitive side and her [[Self-sufficiency|self-sufficient]] attitude is illustrated in the series' final episode "There Are Crocodiles." Reprimanding the ghost of Gary (Mark Sayers), who died after taking a drug overdose, she says:

<blockquote>Look, I'm sorry you're dead OK? I ''do'' care. But to be perfectly honest with you, I don't care a lot. You had a choice, you took the drugs, you died. Are you seriously claiming no one told you it was dangerous? ... I mean, have you had a look at the world lately? ... There's plenty of stuff going on that kills you and you don't get warned at all. So sticking your head in a crocodile you were told about is not calculated to get my sympathy.<ref name="tac"/></blockquote>

Having the protagonist repent in hell is, according to Moffat, "always a  novel way to end a teen-romance series."<ref name="Moffcomm"/> Whether or not Lynda dies is ambiguous.
[[Image:Press Gnag - Spike, Kenny and Lynda.JPG|thumb|250px|Spike, Kenny and Lynda discuss the lead story in "Page One"]]
'''James "Spike" Thomson''' ([[Dexter Fletcher]]) is an American delinquent, forced to work on the paper rather than being excluded from school. He is immediately attracted to Lynda, and he establishes himself as an important member of the reporting team having been responsible for getting their first lead story. He usually has a range of one-liners, though is often criticised, particularly by Lynda, for excessive joking. However, Spike often consciously uses humour to lighten the tone, such as in "Monday-Tuesday" when he tries to cheer up Lynda after she feels responsible for David's suicide.<ref name="m-t"/>

The character was originally written as English, until producer Hastie felt that an American character would enhance the chance of overseas sales. This meant that English-born Fletcher had to act in an [[Regional accents of English speakers|American accent]] for all five years. Moffat says that he isn't "sure [that] lumbering Dexter with that accent was a smart move."<ref name="moffint">{{cite web |title=Interview: Steven Moffat |work=BBC - Cult Television |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/news/cult/2004/07/20/13052.shtml |date=[[2004-07-20]] |accessdate=2006-12-21}}</ref> His accent, however, was so convincing that many are surprised to learn that Fletcher is English.<ref name="dexter">{{cite news |title=Dexter Fletcher answers your questions |work=The Times |format=reprint on unofficial fansite |url=http://dexteronline.ms11.net/times130704.html|date=[[2004-07-13]]  |accessdate=2006-12-22}}</ref>

'''Kenny Phillips''' ([[Lee Ross (actor)|Lee Ross]]) is one of Lynda's (few) long-term friends and is her assistant editor in the first three seasons. Kenny is much calmer than Lynda, though is still dominated by her. Despite this, he is one of the few people able to stand up to Lynda, in his own quiet way. Although he identifies himself as "sweet", he is unlucky in love: Jenny ([[Sadie Frost]]), the girlfriend he meets in "How to Make a Killing",<ref name="htmak"/> dumps him because he is too understanding.<ref name="love">{{cite episode |title=Love and the Junior Gazette |series=Press Gang |credits=wr. Steven Moffat, dir. Bob Spiers |network=ITV |airdate=1990-02-15 |season=2 |number=5}}</ref> His secret passion for writing music is revealed at the end of series two, which was influenced by Ross' interests. Colin organizes and markets a concert for him, and series two ends with Kenny performing "You Don't Feel For Me" (written by Ross himself).<ref name="big finish"/> Lee Ross was only able to commit to the first six episodes of the 12-episode series three and four filming block because he was expecting a film role.<ref name="hastie"/> Thus, by series four, Kenny has left for [[Australia]].

'''Colin Mathews''' ([[Paul Reynolds (actor)|Paul Reynolds]]) is the [[Thatcherite]] in charge of the paper's finances and advertising. He often wears loud shirts, and his various schemes have included marketing defective half-[[ping-pong]] balls (as 'pings'), exam revision kits and [[soft drink|soda]] that leaves facial stains. [[Rosie Marcel]] and Claire Hearnden appear throughout the second series as Sophie and Laura, Colin's mischievous young helpers.

'''Julie Craig''' ([[Lucy Benjamin]]) is the head of the graphics team in season one. Moffat was impressed with Benjamin's performance, and expanded her character for the second series.<ref name="petford"/> However she had committed herself to roles in the [[LWT]] sitcom ''[[Close to Home (UK TV series)|Close to Home]]'' and ''[[Jupiter Moon]]'', so the character was replaced by Sam.<ref name="putp"/> The character returns in the opening episode of series four as researcher on the Saturday morning show ''Crazy Stuff''. She arranges for Lynda and Spike to be reunited on [[live television]], but the subsequent complaints about the violence (face slapping) results in Julie's firing.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Bad News |series=Press Gang |credits=wr. Steven Moffat, dir. Bob Spiers |network=ITV |airdate=1992-01-07 |season=4 |number=1}}</ref> After giving Lynda some home truths, Julie replaces Kenny as the assistant editor for the final two series. She is a flirt, and, according to Lynda, was the "official pin-up at the last [[prison riot]]."<ref name="tac"/>
 
'''Sarah Jackson''' ([[Kelda Holmes]]) is the paper's lead writer. Although she is intelligent she gets stressed, such as during her interview for editorship of the ''Junior Gazette''. Her final episode, "Friendly Fire", shows the development of her friendship with Lynda, and how the latter saw her as a challenge when she first arrived to Norbridge High. Together they had established the underground school magazine: ''Damn Magazine''.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Friendly Fire |series=Press Gang |credits = wr. Steven Moffat, dir.

'''Frazer "Frazz" Davis''' ([[Mmoloki Chrystie]]) is one of Spike's co-delinquents forced into working on the paper, his initial main task writing the [[horoscope]]s. Frazz is initially portrayed as unintelligent, such as not understanding the synonymous relationship between "the astrology column" and the horoscopes.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Page One |series=Press Gang |credits=wr. Steven Moffat, dir. Colin Nutley |network=ITV |airdate=1989-01-16 |season=1 |number=1}}</ref> Later episodes, however, show him to be devious, such as in "The Last Word: Part 2" when he stuns the gunman using a large array of [[flashgun]]s.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Last Word: Part 2 |series=Press Gang |credits=wr.

===Other recurring characters===
'''Sam Black''' ([[Gabrielle Anwar]]) replaced Julie as the head of the graphics team in the second series. Sam is very fashion conscious and a flirt, and is surprised when an actor rejects her advances in favour of Sarah.<ref name="love"/> Anwar had auditioned for the role of Lynda. (Many actors who unsuccessfully auditioned for main characters were invited back later for guest roles.)<ref name="putp"/> Moffat had expanded the role of Julie after the first season, but Lucy Benjamin was unavailable for series two. Sam, therefore, was basically the character of Julie under a different name, especially in her earlier 
episodes.<ref name="petford"/><ref>Steven Moffat & Julia Sawalha  "Breakfast at Czar's" ''Press Gang: Season 2'' DVD audio commentary</ref> [[Charlie Creed-Miles]], who played Danny McColl, the paper's photographer, became disenchanted with his minor role and left after the first series.<ref name="putp"/>

"Tiddler" Tildesley ([[Joanna Dukes]]) is the junior member of the team, responsible for the junior section, ''Junior Junior Gazette''. Billy Homer (Andy Crowe) was also a recurring character. A [[tetraplegic]], he is very competent with computer networks, sometimes [[Hack (technology)|hacking]] in to the school's database. His storylines are some of the first representations of the Internet in British television. Moffat felt that he was unable to sustain the character, and he appears only sporadically after the first series.<ref name="putp"/> The main adults are deputy headmaster Bill Sullivan ([[Nick Stringer]]), maverick editor Matt Kerr ([[Clive Wood]]) and experienced ''Gazette'' reporter Chrissie Stewart ([[Angela Bruce]]).

==Reaction==
===Critical reception===
Critical reaction was good, being particularly praised for the high quality and sophistication of the writing.<ref name="bbcreviews2"/><ref>{{cite web|title=The Junior Gazette's back for a 3rd season on DVD |work=cult.tv |url=http://www.cult.tv/index.php?cm_id=717&cm_type=article |accessdate=2006-12-21}}</ref> The BBC's William Gallagher called it "pretty flawless."<ref>{{cite news |first=William |last=Gallagher |title=The week's TV: Seen it all before? |date=[[2001-08-30]] |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/1516439.stm |accessdate=2007-11-07}}</ref> The first episode was highly rated by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', ''[[The Guardian]]'' and the ''[[Times Educational Supplement]]''.<ref name="putp"/> In his emphatic review, Paul Cornell writes that:

<blockquote>''Press Gang'' has proved to be a series that can transport you back to how you felt as a teenager, sharper that the world but with as much angst as acute wit ... Never again can a show get away with talking down to children or writing sloppily for them. ''Press Gang'', possibly the best show in the world.<ref name="cornell218">Cornell, 218</ref></blockquote>

''[[Time Out]]'' said that "this is quality entertainment: the kids are sharp, the scripts are clever and the jokes are good."<ref>{{cite web |title=Press Gang: 43xhalf hour|work=Press Gang [Unofficial fansite] |url=http://www.geocities.com/davinci5157/ |accessdate=2006-12-21}}</ref> Others have also commented upon how "the show is renowned ... for doing something kid television at the time didn't do (and, arguably, still doesn't): it refused to treat its audience like children."<ref>{{cite web |first=Nikki |last=Tranter |title=Press Gang: Series 1 |work=PopMatters |url=http://www.popmatters.com/tv/reviews/p/press-gang-1.shtml |date[[2004-03-01]] |accessdate=2006-12-22}}</ref> Comedian [[Richard Herring]] recalls watching the show as a recent graduate, commenting that it "was subtle, sophisticated and much too good for kids."<ref name="herring"/> According to Moffat, "''Press Gang'' had gone over very, very well in the industry and I was being touted and romanced all the time." ''Press Gang'''s complicated plots and structure would become a hallmark of Moffat's work, such as ''Joking Apart'' and ''[[Coupling (UK TV series)|Coupling]]''.<ref>{{cite web |first=Graham |last=Kibble-White |title="Fool If You Think It's Over"|work=Off the Telly |url=http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/comedy/jokingapart.htm|date=May 2006 |accessdate=2006-12-22}}</ref>

The series received a [[Royal Television Society]] award and a [[BAFTA]] in 1991 for "Best Children's Programme (Entertainment/Drama)".<ref name="screenonline"/> It was also nominated for two [[Writers' Guild of Great Britain]] awards, one ''Prix Jeunesse''<ref>{{cite web |title=Biographies: Steven Moffat - Writer |work=[[Hartswood Films]] |url=http://www.hartswoodfilms.co.uk/programmes/steven.html |accessdate=2006-12-23}}</ref> and the 1992 BAFTA for "Best Children's Programme (Fiction)".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bafta.org/awards/childrens/nominations/?year=1991 |title=Children's Nominations 1991 |work=BAFTA |accessdate=2007-11-16}}</ref> Julia Sawalha won the Royal Television Society Television Award for "Best Actor - Female" in 1993.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096679/awards |title=Awards for "Press Gang" (1989) |work=IMDb |accessdate=2006-12-24}}</ref>

===Repeat showings===
The show gained an adult audience in an early evening slot when repeated on Sundays on [[Channel 4]].<ref name="cornell218"/> This crossover is reflected in the BBC's review for one of the DVDs when they say that "''Press Gang'' is one of the best series ever made for kids. Or adults."<ref>{{cite web |title=Press Gang 4 DVD |work=BBC - Cult Television |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/news/cult/2005/06/04/19813.shtml |date=[[2005-06-04]] |accessdate=2006-12-22}}</ref>

[[Nickelodeon (British TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] showed nearly all of the episodes in a weekday slot in 1997. The final three episodes of the third series, however, were not repeated on the children's channel because of their content: "The Last Word" double episode with the gun siege, and "Holding On" with the repetition of the phrase "divorce the [[bitch]]".<ref name="holdingon"/> On the first transmission of the latter on [[11 June]] [[1991]], [[continuity announcer]] [[Tommy Boyd]] warned viewers that it contained stronger than usual language. In 2007, [[itv.com]] made the first series, with the exception of "Page One", available to be viewed on its website free of charge.<ref>{{cite web |title=Press Gang |work=itv.com |url=http://www.itv.com/BestofITV/kids/pressgang/ |accessdate=2007-11-19}}</ref>

===Fan following===
''Press Gang'' has attracted a cult following. A [[fanzine]], ''Breakfast at Czars'', was produced in the 1990s. Edited by Stephen O'Brien, it contained a range of interviews with the cast and crew (notably with producer Hastie), theatre reviews and [[fanfiction]]. The first edition was included as a PDF file on the series two DVD, while the next three were on the series five disc. An [[mailing list|e-mail discussion list]] has been operational since February 1997.<ref>{{cite web|title=Press Gang: The Mailing List |url=http://www.yoyo.org/pressgang/mailinglist/ |accessdate=2006-12-23}}</ref>

Two [[Fan convention|convention]]s were held in the mid 1990s in [[Liverpool]]. The events, in aid of the NSPCC, were each titled "Both Sides of the Paper" and were attended by Steven Moffat, Sandra Hastie, Dexter Fletcher, Paul Reynolds, Kelda Holmes and Nick Stringer. There were screenings of extended rough cuts of "A Quarter to Midnight" and "There Are Crocodiles", along with auctions of wardrobe and props.<ref name="petford"/> The ''Press Gang Programme Guide'', edited by Jim Sangster, was published by Leomac Publishing in 1995.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Jim Sangster |title=Press Gang Programme Guide|date=1995|publisher= Leomac Publishing |id=0952695502}}</ref> Sangster, O'Brien and Adrian Petford<ref name="petford"/> collaborated with [[Network DVD]] on the extra features for the DVD releases.

[[Big Finish Productions]], which produces [[radio drama|audio plays]] based on sci-fi properties, particularly ''[[Doctor Who]]'', was named after the title of the final episode of the second season. Its founder, [[Gary Russell]], had previous companies named after ''Press Gang'' episodes: Page One Productions, Photo Finish Productions, Rock Solid Productions and At Last, A Dragon! Productions.<ref>{{cite web |title=DIY Sheep versus Doctor Who and everybody else: Doctor Who is back and he's as stupid as ever |url=http://diysheep.tripod.com/id74.html |accessdate=2007-03-31}}</ref> Moffat himself is an ardent ''Doctor Who'' fan and has written several short stories and four episodes of the revival.<ref>"[[The Empty Child]]"; "[[The Doctor Dances]]"; "[[The Girl in the Fireplace]]" and "[[Blink (Doctor Who)|Blink]]"</ref>

Moffat integrated many references to ''Press Gang'''s secondary characters and locations in his 1997 sitcom ''[[Chalk (TV series)|Chalk]]''. Such references cite neighbouring school Norbridge High, run by Mr Sullivan, and also the characters Dr Clipstone ("UneXpected"), Malcolm Bullivant ("Something Terrible") and David Jefford ("Monday-Tuesday"/"There are Crocodiles"),<ref name="addinfo"/> a pupil who Mr Slatt ([[David Bamber]]) reprimands for [[masturbating]].<ref>{{cite episode |title=Mother |series=Chalk |credits=wr. Steven Moffat, dir. Juliet May |network=BBC One |airdate=1997-03-27 |season=1 |number=6}}</ref> In the first episode of Moffat's ''[[Jekyll (TV series)|Jekyll]]'', Mr Hyde ([[James Nesbitt]]) whistled the same tune as Lynda in "Going Back to Jasper Street".

===Proposed television movie===
A [[television film]] called "Deadline" was planned. It was set a few years after the series and aimed at a more adult audience. At one stage in 1992, series 4 was intended to be the last, and the movie was proposed as a follow up. However, making of the film fell through when a fifth series was commissioned instead. The idea of the follow up film was several times reconsidered during the 1990s, but every time fell through for various reasons.<ref name="addinfo"/>

In June 2007, ''[[The Stage]]'' reported that Moffat and Sawalha are interested in reviving ''Press Gang''. He said: "I would revive that like a shot. I would love to do a reunion episode — a grown-up version. I know Julia Sawalha is interested — every time I see her she asks me when we are going to do it. Maybe it will happen — I would like it to."<ref>{{cite web |title=Steven Moffat wants to bring back ‘Press Gang’ |work=[[The Stage]] |url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/tvtoday/2007/06/steven_moffat_wants_to_bring_back_press_gang.php |date=[[2007-06-13]] |accessdate=2007-06-15}}</ref>
