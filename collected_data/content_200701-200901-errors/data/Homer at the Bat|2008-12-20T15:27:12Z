"'''Homer at the Bat'''" is the seventeenth episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> [[The Simpsons (season 3)|third season]], which originally aired February 20, 1992.<ref name="officialsite">{{cite web|url=http://www.thesimpsons.com/episode_guide/0317.htm|title=Homer at the Bat|accessdate=2007-08-03|publisher=The Simpsons.com}}</ref> The episode follows the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]] softball team, led by [[Homer Simpson|Homer]], having a winning season and making the championship game. [[Montgomery Burns|Mr. Burns]] makes a large bet that the team will win and brings in nine ringers from the "[[Major League Baseball|big leagues]]" to ensure his success.  It was written by [[John Swartzwelder]], who is a big [[baseball]] fan, and directed by [[Jim Reardon]].

[[Roger Clemens]], [[Wade Boggs]], [[Ken Griffey, Jr.]], [[Steve Sax]], [[Ozzie Smith]], [[José Canseco]], [[Don Mattingly]], [[Darryl Strawberry]] and [[Mike Scioscia]] all guest starred as themselves, playing the ringers hired by Mr. Burns. [[Terry Cashman]] also sang a song over the end credits.<ref name="officialsite"/> The guest stars were recorded over several months, with differing degrees of cooperation. The episode is often named among the show's best, and was the first to beat ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' in the ratings on its original airing.

==Plot==
It is softball season in Springfield and many of the workers at [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]] are reluctant to sign up for the Power Plant team due to their previous unsuccessful year. Homer reveals that he has a secret weapon, a homemade bat named "Wonder Bat" and his co-workers eagerly join the team. Thanks in large part to Homer, the team goes through its season undefeated and earns the right to play in the championship game against the [[Shelbyville (The Simpsons)|Shelbyville]] Nuclear Power Plant.

[[Montgomery Burns|Mr. Burns]] makes a million dollar bet with [[List of one-time characters from The Simpsons#Aristotle Amadopoulos|Aristotle Amadopoulos]], owner of the Shelbyville plant, that his team will win. To secure victory in the game, Burns decides to hire major league stars and assembles a team that includes [[Honus Wagner]], [[Cap Anson]], [[Mordecai Brown|Mordecai "Three Finger" Brown]], and a [[Jim Creighton|right fielder]] who has been dead for 130 years. Smithers informs Burns that the players he picked are all retired or dead, and so Burns changes tactics and orders Smithers to find some current superstar players. He hires nine [[Major League Baseball]] players - [[Roger Clemens]], [[Wade Boggs]], [[Ken Griffey, Jr.]], [[Steve Sax]], [[Ozzie Smith]], [[José Canseco]], [[Don Mattingly]], [[Darryl Strawberry]] and [[Mike Scioscia]] - and gives them token jobs at the plant so that they can play on the team, much to the dismay of the plant workers who got the team to the championship game in the first place.

However, before the game, eight of the nine all-star players suffer unrelated misfortunes that prevent them from playing: Clemens is made to think he is a chicken due to a bad [[hypnotist]], Boggs is knocked unconscious by [[Barney Gumble|Barney]], Griffey, Jr. takes an overdoses of nerve tonic, resulting in an extreme case of [[gigantism]], Sax is arrested, Smith disappears in the "Springfield mystery spot", Canseco is too busy rescuing a woman and her possessions from a fire, Mattingly is kicked off the team by Mr. Burns due to [[sideburns]] only he can see, and Scioscia is hospitalized due to [[radiation poisoning]] from the plant. Burns is forced to use his original employees, along with Strawberry, the only star who can play. Homer remains on the bench as Strawberry plays his position. 

With the score tied and bases loaded with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning, Burns elects to field a [[Platoon system|right-handed hitter against a left-handed pitcher]] and [[Pinch hitter|pinch hits]] Homer for Strawberry. The very first pitch [[hit by pitch|hits Homer]] in the head, rendering him unconscious, but forcing in the winning run. The team wins the title and Homer, still unconscious, is paraded as a hero.<ref name="book"/><ref name="bbc"/><ref name=officialsite/>

"Homer at the Bat" took a long time to produce.<ref name="Jean"/> It was written by [[John Swartzwelder]], who is a big baseball fan,<ref name="Martin"/> but was suggested by [[Sam Simon]], who wanted an episode filled with real [[Major League Baseball]] players.<ref name="Jean">{{cite video | people=Jean, Al|year=2003|title=The Simpsons season 3 DVD commentary for the episode "Homer at the Bat"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Executive producers Al Jean and Mike Reiss doubted that they would be able to get nine players, thinking that they would be able to get three at best. However, they succeeded, and the nine players who agreed to guest star were recorded over a period of six months,<ref name="Reiss">{{cite video | people=Reiss, Mike|year=2003|title=The Simpsons season 3 DVD commentary for the episode "Homer at the Bat"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> whenever they were playing the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] or [[California Angels]].<ref name="Jean"/> Each player recorded their part in roughly five minutes and spent the next hour writing autographs for the staff.<ref name=paper>{{cite news|title=Hairy problem dogs mattingly Don gets a 'toon-up' on 'Simpsons' tonight|accessdate=2008-02-19|date=[[1992-02-20]]|author=Tim Kaiser|page=C2|publisher=The Evansville Courier}}</ref>  In several cases, the writers were unable to get the player who was their first choice.<ref name="Jean"/> Two of the players who turned down the chance to guest star were [[Ryne Sandberg]] and [[Carlton Fisk]].<ref name=paper/> 

All of the players were cooperative except for [[José Canseco]], who was intimidating.<ref name="Jean"/> He disliked his original part and insisted it be rewritten, and the writers grudgingly<ref name="Martin">{{cite video | people=Martin, Jeff|year=2003|title=The Simpsons season 3 DVD commentary for the episode "Homer at the Bat"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> made him as heroic as possible.<ref name="Jean"/> He was originally slated to wake up in bed with [[Edna Krabappel]] and miss the game, but Canseco's then-wife, Esther Haddad, objected.<ref name=sports>{{cite news|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_6436656?nclick_check=1|title=Eat my sports: athletes and `The Simpsons'|accessdate=2007-08-03|author=Daniel Brown|date=[[2007-07-22]]|publisher=San Jose Mercury News}}</ref> He disliked his caricature, stating that "the animation looked nothing like [him],"<ref name=sports/> but that he found the acting was very easy.<ref name=other>{{cite news|title='Homer at the Bat' - Simpsons classic features all-star lineup |accessdate=2008-02-19|date=[[2007-07-27]]|author=Daniel Brown|page=B2|publisher=[[San Jose Mercury News]]}}</ref> When asked about his part by the [[San Jose Mercury]], he responded, "that was 100 years ago," hung up the phone, and did not answer any of the paper's subsequent calls for an interview about his guest spot.<ref name=sports/>

[[Ken Griffey, Jr.]] did not understand his line "there's a party in my mouth and everyone's invited" and got quite frustrated when he was recording it. He was directed by [[Mike Reiss]], and his father [[Ken Griffey, Sr.]] was also present, trying to coach his son.<ref name="Reiss"/> [[Roger Clemens]], who made his own chicken noises, was directed by [[Jeff Martin]], as was [[Wade Boggs]].<ref name="Martin"/> Mike Reiss directed most of the other players.<ref name="Reiss"/> Mike Scioscia accepted his guest spot in "half a second," while Ozzie Smith has stated that he would like to guest star again "so [he] can get out [of the Springfield Mystery spot]."<ref name=other/> [[Don Mattingly]], who was forced to shave off his "sideburns" by Mr. Burns during the episode, would later have an actual "haircut controversy", while he was playing for the [[New York Yankees]]. The coaching staff forced him to cut his long hair, and was briefly dropped from the team line-up for not doing so. Many people believed the joke in the episode to be a reference to the incident, but "Homer at the Bat" was recorded a year before it happened.<ref name=other/><ref>{{cite news|title=Truth Mirrors 'Simpsons' Fiction|accessdate=2008-07-07|date=[[1992-02-23]]|publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]]|page=3}}</ref> Many of the guest stars, including Terry Cashman, Wade Boggs and Darryl Strawberry all admit that they are more well known because of their appearance in the episode, Cashman having "Talkin' Softball" requested more often than "[[Talkin' Baseball]]".<ref name=other/>

One of the hardest pieces of editing was the hypnotist segment, which featured several of the guest stars speaking in unison. It was difficult because the parts were recorded over a period of several months and thus it was hard to sync their voices.<ref name="Reiss"/> [[Rich Moore]] was originally intended to direct the episode, but as he did not know anything about baseball he was switched with [[Jim Reardon]], who was a baseball fan. Moore was given the episode "[[Lisa the Greek]]" instead.<ref name="Reardon">{{cite video | people=Reardon, Jim|year=2003|title=The Simpsons season 3 DVD commentary for the episode "Homer at the Bat"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Many of the player designs were difficult, because the animators had a hard time designing real world people during the early years.<ref name="Reardon"/>

==Cultural references==
The episode makes several allusions to the film ''[[The Natural (film)|The Natural]]''. Homer's secret weapon, his self-created "Wonderbat", is akin to [[Roy Hobbs]]'s "Wonderboy", and both bats are eventually destroyed. The scene featuring the explosion of stadium lights as Homer circles the basepaths is also taken directly from the film.<ref name="book"/><ref name="bbc"/> The end song "Talkin' Softball" is a parody of "Talkin' Baseball" by [[Terry Cashman]]. Jeff Martin wrote the new version of the song, but Cashman was brought in to sing it.<ref name="Martin"/> The scenes of the Power Plant team traveling from city to city by train, overlaid with the pennant of the city they are going to, is a reference to the 1942 film ''[[The Pride of the Yankees]]''.<ref name="Castellaneta">{{cite video | people=Castellaneta, Dan|year=2003|title=The Simpsons season 3 DVD commentary for the episode "Homer at the Bat"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> [[Carl Carlson|Carl]] batting with a piano leg is a reference to [[Norm Cash]] of the [[Detroit Tigers]], who once tried to bat with a table leg in a game where [[Nolan Ryan]] was extremely overpowering.<ref name="Jean"/>

==Reception==
[[Image:Ken Griffey Jr 2004.jpg|left|150px|thumb|[[Ken Griffey, Jr.]]]]
During [[The Simpsons (season 2)|the previous season]], Fox had put ''The Simpsons'' in a timeslot that meant it was in direct competition with ''[[The Cosby Show]]'', which won the timeslot every time.<ref name="Jean"/> "Homer at the Bat" had a 15.9 rating and 23% share to win its timeslot while ''The Cosby Show'' had a 13.2 rating and 20% share. This was the first time that a new ''Simpsons'' episode beat a new ''Cosby Show'' episode.<ref>{{cite news|title=As Bart Simpson might say, Emmy rules should get real|date=[[1992-02-24]]|accessdate=2008-02-09|page=44|publisher=[[Rocky Mountain News]]|author=Dusty Saunders}}</ref> Former [[executive producer]] [[Sam Simon]] and current [[showrunner]] Al Jean named it as their favorite episode.<ref>{{cite news|title=Insiders name their favorite episodes|accessdate=2008-02-19|date=[[2007-05-20]]|page=10F|author=Neal Justin|publisher=[[Star Tribune]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Fans' knowledge floors show's top executive|accessdate=2008-02-19|date=[[2001-05-29]]|page=8D|author=Patrick Kampert|publisher=[[Sun-Sentinel]]}}</ref> Regular cast members [[Harry Shearer]] and [[Julie Kavner]] disliked the episode because of its focus on the guest stars and its surreal tone.<ref name="Reiss"/> They were particularly annoyed by the Mattingly sideburns joke.<ref name="Martin"/>

Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'', praised the episode, calling it "a great episode because the accidents that befall the pro players are so funny."<ref name=bbc/> Chris Turner, the author of the book ''[[Planet Simpson]]'', said that the episode was the indication that "the Golden Age [of the show] had arrived."<ref>{{cite book| last = Turner| first = Chris| title = [[Planet Simpson: How a Cartoon Masterpiece Documented an Era and Defined a Generation]]| isbn = 0-679-31318-4| page = 39}}</ref> Nate Meyers gave the episode four and a half out of five, stating "the script makes great use of the baseball superstars, giving each of them a strong personality and plenty of pep (the highlight has to be Mattingly's clash with Mr. Burns)."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitallyobsessed.com/showreview.php3?ID=6129|title=The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season|accessdate=2007-08-03|author=Nate Meyers|date=[[2004-06-23]]|publisher=Digitally Obssessed}}</ref> Colin Jacobson disliked the episode: "when ["Homer at the Bat"] originally aired, I didn't like it. While I've warmed up to the show slightly over the last decade, I still think it's generally weak, and I'd definitely pick it as Season Three's worst."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdmg.com/simpsonsseasonthree.shtml|title=The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season (1991)|accessdate=2007-08-03|date=[[2003-08-21]]|author=Colin Jacobson|publisher=DVD Movie Guide}}</ref>

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' placed the episode fifteenth on their top 25 ''The Simpsons'' episodes list, noting it was "early proof that ''The Simpsons'' could juggle a squad of guest stars without giving the family short shrift."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,417748_3,00.html|title=The Family Dynamic|accessdate=2007-08-03|date=[[2003-01-29]]|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref> It was placed third on AskMen.com's "Top 10: Simpsons Episodes" list, Rich Weir called it "one of the show's more memorable moments" and "effective as it combines a slew of guest stars with some hilarious material for Homer."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.askmen.com/toys/top_10_60/64c_top_10_list.html|title=Top 10: Simpsons Episodes|accessdate=2007-08-03|author=Weir, Rich|publisher=Askmen.com}}</ref> The entire episode was placed first on ESPN.com's list of the "Top 100 Simpsons sport moments", released in 2004. Greg Collins, the author of the list, gave great praise of the episode. He stated that this is the "king of all sports episodes, and perhaps the greatest ''Simpsons'' episode ever." A friend of Collins later met guest star Mike Scioscia and told him the he thought his guest spot was the best thing Scioscia had ever done, he responded "Thanks, I think".<ref>{{cite web|author=Collins, Greg|title=The Simpsons Got Game|publisher=ESPN.com|date=[[2004-01-23]]|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page3/story?page=simpsons/part4|accessdate=2007-03-29}}</ref> Eric Reinagel, Brian Moritz and John Hill of ''[[Press & Sun-Bulletin]]'' named the episode the fourth best in the show's history,<ref>{{cite news|title=WOO-HOO!
