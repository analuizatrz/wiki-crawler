The '''District of Taylor''' is a small town in northeastern [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], located on mile 36 of the [[Alaska Highway]], between [[Fort St. John]] and [[Dawson Creek]]. The municipality covers a total area of 16.61&nbsp;km² (6.41&nbsp;mile²) with about 1,346 residents.<ref>BC Stats, [http://www.bcstats.gov.bc.ca/data/dd/facsheet/cf266.pdf "Taylor District Municipality" (pdf)], ''Community Facts'', [[5 February]] [[2006]].</ref> Taylor is a member municipality of the [[Peace River Regional District, British Columbia|Peace River Regional District]]. The town was incorporated in 1958 and named after the Taylor [[Terrace deposit|Flats]] which the town is situated upon, and which is named after the early settler Herbert Taylor.

It boasts a golf course, and is the site of the Annual World's Invitational Class 'A' Gold Panning Championships every summer, which is partially due to the role that gold-panners played in the historical development of the area. Taylor is situated on the [[Peace River (Canada)|Peace River]].

Taylor was founded in 1912 (although it wasn't officially created by the provincial government until 1958), and is named after Herbert Taylor, a [[trapper]] and ferryman. Taylor is also the site of a [[Duke Energy]] gas plant.

==History==
The town, and the Taylor Flats upon which the town is located, are named after Herbert Taylor, a fur-trader with the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] who regularly met his Aboriginal trading counterparts on this river flat. In 1911 Taylor left his employers and took up residence on the flats with a few other squatters. The following year the federal government opened the area to homesteading and Taylor received the [[Dominion Land Survey|quater-section]] (63 hectares - 160 acres) upon which he had settled.<ref>Harrison, Hal (1981) "Birth of the South Peace" in ''Lure of the South Peace: Tales of the Early Pioneers'' Dawson Creek: South Peace Historical Book Committee. pg. 273.</ref> These early settlers were trappers with the first farm established by Henry Philip, from [[Glasgow]], who inherited the buildings, equipment and land from his survey team when they left the area. In 1919, with the help of Taylor's nine children, along with those from a few American families who settled there, the provincial government opened the Taylor Flats School. 

These early settlers all came to the area through the [[Peace River Country]], from [[Grande Prairie, Alberta|Grande Prairie]], through [[Pouce Coupe, British Columbia|Pouce Coupe]], and had to cross the Peace River. However, many decided to settle on the steep-sloped south side of the Peace River, an area that would become known as South Taylor. To cross the river a [[cable ferry]], which would prove to be accident-prone, was built in the 1920s but soon replaced with a motor-driven ferry. This ferry was used until 1942 when the U.S. Army came through the area building the [[Alaska Highway]] and constructed the 2,130 foot long Peace River Suspension Bridge across the river. The highway connected the town to a rail station in [[Dawson Creek, British Columbia|Dawson Creek]] reducing the dependence on shipping along the river. However, the bridge collapsed on [[16 October]] [[1957]] with no injuries or fatalities<ref>[http://collections.ic.gc.ca/north_peace/transport/02.07.html Collapsed Peace River Bridge] ''History of the North Peace''. URL accessed on [[5 February]] [[2006]].</ref><ref name=history>[http://www.districtoftaylor.com/itoolkit.asp?pg=Taylor's_History&k=1&pp=1 Taylor's History] ''District of Taylor''. URL accessed on [[5 February]] [[2006]].</ref> and replaced with the Peace River Bridge which still stands today. Also, in 1957, following the construction of a highway and rail line through the Rocky Mountains, a rail trestle bridge was constructed connecting the community to [[Chetwynd, British Columbia|Chetwynd]] and the interior of British Columbia.

Major industrial development began in 1957, when Westcoast Transmission (later Duke Energy) built the province's first gas processing plant, as well as a refinery and pipeline from this plant to [[Kamloops, British Columbia|Kamloops]].<ref>Westcoast Energy [http://www.westcoastenergy.com/about/history_gathering.html Gathering, Processing and Transportation] ''History''. URL accessed on [[5 February]] [[2006]].</ref> The community that formed around this industrial development was incorporated as a village on [[23 August]] [[1958]]. Meanwhile, x km (x miles) upstream, the [[W.A.C. Bennett Dam]] and [[Peace Canyon Dam]]s were completed in 1966 and 1980, resepectively, which had the effect of controlling the level and flow of the Peace River water flow making navigation and flood maintenance much easier.

In the late-1980s [[Canfor]] and Fibreco opened sawmills in town which further developed the industrial and population base allowing the village to be re-incorporated into the District of Taylor in 1989. In the 1990s a strong industrial sector has helped develop the small town into a strong community with many recreational amenities. Since 1993, the town of 1,300 people have built a new hockey arena, leisure skating arena, curling rink, and 18 hole golf course. Strong community pride also developed as demonstrated by the town placing first at the provincial level, in its small category, in the parks and gardens-oriented Communities in Bloom Competition in 1997 and second in the national competition in 1998.<ref name=history/><ref>[http://www.communitiesinbloom.ca/participants/participants_pastnat.html 2001 - 1995 National Past Finalists] ''Communities in Bloom''. URL accessed [[26 April]] [[2006]]</ref> Remembering its history, the District, in 2000, built a memorial garden and cenotaph dedicated to the 341st Engineers of the U.S. Army corps of Engineers who were stationed on the Taylor Flats in 1942 during the construction of the Alaska Highway and the Peace River Suspension Bridge.

==Demographics==
[[Image:Taylor, BC population.png|thumb|right|250px|Population trend 1976–2005, BC Stats.<ref>BC Stats, [http://www.bcstats.gov.bc.ca/data/pop/pop/mun/Mun7686a.asp British Columbia Municipal Census Populations, 1976–1986], [[November 27]] [[2005]].</ref> <ref>BC Stats, [http://www.bcstats.gov.bc.ca/data/pop/pop/mun/Mun8696a.asp British Columbia Municipal Census Populations, 1986–1996], [[November 27]] [[2005]].</ref> <ref>BC Stats, [http://www.bcstats.gov.bc.ca/data/pop/pop/mun/Mun9605a.asp British Columbia Municipal Census Populations, 1996–2005], [[November 27]] [[2005]].</ref>]]

The 1961 Canadian census, the first to include Taylor as a distinct subdivision, counted 438 people.<ref name=BCStats1961>BC Stats, [http://www.bcstats.gov.bc.ca/data/pop/pop/mun/Mun2171.asp British Columbia Municipal Census Populations, 1921-1971], [[November 27]] [[2005]].</ref> In the next five years the population rose 36% to 595 people but, by 1971, the population only rose a further 2% to 605 people.<ref name=BCStats1961/> The population spiked in the late-1970s as construction of the Peace Canyon Dam occurred nearby and sawmills were opened in town. Since the population loss in the early-1980s associated with the completion of the dam, the population has steadily increased as the economy has diversified into the service sector.

According to the [[Canada 2001 Census|2001 Canadian census]],<ref name=statscan>Statistics Canada, [http://www12.statcan.ca/english/Profil01/CP01/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=5955030&Geo2=PR&Code2=59&Data=Count&SearchText=Taylor&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=59&B1=All&Custom= Community Highlights for Taylor], ''2001 Community Profiles'', [[November 27]] [[2005]].</ref> there were 1,143 people living in the municipality in 435 [[household]]s. The municipality has a much lower percentage of people over the age of 65, at 5.2%, compared to the province, at 13.6%. The dominant religion is Protestantism, at 29% claiming affiliation, with Catholicism forming the minority at 14% claiming affiliation. Of the population over 20 years old in Taylor, 41% have less than a high school graduation certificate, which is much higher than the 24% province-wide average. Also, the census recorded no visible minorities living in Taylor.

==Geography and climate==
[[Image:Taylor BC Townsite.jpg|left|thumb|250px|District of Taylor's townsite]]
The Taylor Flats, on which the town is situated upon, was formed by a pre-glacial bend in the Peace River that now flows eastwards on the southern edge of town. The terrace is approximately 60&nbsp;m above the Peace River. [[Escarpment]]s north of town encircle the terrace and rise another 100&nbsp;m to the upland prairies.

The soil of the Taylor Flats was rated 1<sup>7</sup>-2<sup>3</sup><sub>x</sub> in the [[Canada Land Inventory]] meaning the land is level and is mixed in a 7:3 proportion of soils with "no or only very slight limitations that restrict its use for the production of common agricultural crops"<ref name=CLI>Provincial Agricultural Land Commission, [http://www.alc.gov.bc.ca/alr/ag_cap_details.htm#class Capability Classes], ''Agriculture Capability Detailed Description'', [[December 8]] [[2005]].</ref> and "minor limitations that require good ongoing management practices or slightly restrict the range of crops."<ref name=CLI/> The soils are Rego black loam and clay loam that contain few stones or gravel and are well drained, yet hold adequate moisture for crops and have a pH of 6.8. There are several hundred acres of [[Agricultural Land Reserve]] with the municipal boundaries on both the east and west sides of the townsite.

The town has a northern continental climate with cool, short summers and long, cold winters. However, the Taylor Flats’ microclimate, created by the south-facing terrace and the Peace River, produces more frost-free days than most of the [[Peace River Country]]. The town gets an annual average snowfall of 135&nbsp;cm with a January average of 26&nbsp;cm.<ref name=ppt>Environment Canada, [http://www.climate.weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_e.html?Province=BC%20%20&StationName=&SearchType=&LocateBy=Province&Proximity=25&ProximityFrom=City&StationNumber=&IDType=MSC&CityName=&ParkName=&LatitudeDegrees=&LatitudeMinutes=&LongitudeDegrees=&LongitudeMinutes=&NormalsClass=A&SelNormals=&StnId=1443& Taylor Flats, British Columbia], ''Canadian Climate Normals 1971-2000'', [[February 7]] [[2006]].</ref> The average precipitation is 320.8&nbsp;mm per year with a July average of 73.1&nbsp;mm.<ref name=ppt/> The area uses [[Mountain Standard Time]] year round since it already has long daylight hours in the summer and short daylight hours in the winter.

==Transportation and infrastructure==
Taylor's transportation network is dominated by the two-lane [[Alaska Highway]] ([[British Columbia provincial highway 97|B.C. highway 97]]) which runs north-south through the middle of community and provides the only road entrance and exit to the town. There are several intersection along the highway that turn off onto [[frontage road]]s which parallel the highway. Businesses and civic buildings, which are oriented towards the highway, line these frontage roads. The frontage roads also provide access to the housing behind the businesses. In case of an accident on the two-lane highway the frontage roads allow traffic to go around the accident and exit town. A wide right-of-way, that includes a roughly 5 meter wide strip of grass, provides a large building setback distance from the road which helps mitigate noise and other negative impacts of heavy traffic. In total, Taylor maintains 12 km of paved and 11 km of unpaved roads.<ref name=redbook>Reed Construction (2005), ''Municipal redbook: an authoritative reference guide to local government in British Columbia'', Burnaby, BC, 65. {{ISSN|0068-161X}}</ref>

Taylor has limited [[Rail transport|rail]], [[bus]], [[boating]] and [[Fixed-wing aircraft|air]] service for regional and provincial transportation needs. A [[BC Rail]] line runs northeast from Chetwynd to Fort St. John and branches off eastwards, parallel to the Peace River, to Taylor. The rail line’s terminus is in the industrial sector in the southeast corner on the town. The train, which does not offer passenger service, must turn around in the industrial area in order to travel back to the trunk line. [[Greyhound Bus Lines]] maintains a bus stop in Taylor along its the Alaska Highway route from Dawson Creek (58 km, 36 miles south of Taylor) to Fort St. John (15 km, 9 miles north of Taylor). Because the Peace River is controlled by two dams upstream, it is navigable for recreational boats. However, due to the [[coulee]] between industry and the river, the shipping industries in the town did not develop. The closest commercial [[airport]] is Fort St. John & District Airport ([[IATA airport code|IATA code]] YXJ <ref>world-airport-codes.com, [http://www.world-airport-codes.com/canada/fort-st-john-2435.html - Taylor- Airport Details], ''World Airport Codes'', [[February 3]] [[2005]].</ref>), 19 km north of Taylor. The airport has two paved runways, one 6700 feet and the other 6900 feet long.<ref>Fort St. John Airport, [http://www.fsjairport.com/runways.html Facilities - Runways] ''North Peace Airport Services'' [[February 3]] [[2005]].</ref>
[[Image:Taylor BC outline.PNG|thumb|left|250px|District of Taylor map]]
The District uses the Peace River which flows eastward as a source of drinking water and as outlet for industrial waste. The drinking water supply comes from an intake pipe southwest of town. The water is mechanically and chemically filtered then pumped to a reservoir on a ridge north of town. A gravity pump moves the water to the town from the reservoir. The town maintains 18 km of watermains.<ref name=redbook/> Sewage is collected by 13 km of sanitary sewers and processed by a two-cell lagoon system before being absorbed into the ground. The District's 2005 property taxes charged single family homes CAD$130 for drinking water, CAD$102 for sewer, and CAD$49 for garbage collection services.<ref name=redbook/>

Taylor’s schools are administered by British Columbia School District No. 60 (Peace River North). The school board administers only one school in Taylor, Taylor Elementary School<ref>Taylor Elementary School (British Columbia) [http://www.taylor.prn.bc.ca/cont.html Table of Contents], ''Taylor Elementary School'', [[January 22]] [[2006]].</ref>, which, in 2005, had an enrollment of 147 students.<ref>School District No. 60 (British Columbia) [http://www.prn.bc.ca/default.taf?lookup=SD_Dir&loc=20 Taylor Elementary School], ''School District No. 60 (Peace River North)'', [[January 22]] [[2006]].</ref> Starting with grade 8, students are transported to Fort St. John for secondary school education. Taylor funds a volunteer fire department, which covers the town plus several kilometers into the rural areas. The Fort St. John detachment of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] maintain a small sub-station in Taylor to provide police services. The closest hospital for Taylor residents is the Fort St. John General Hospital.

==Economy==
[[Image:Taylor BC business.jpg|thumb|250px|Local businesses]]
According to the 2001 Canadian census,<ref name=statscan/> Taylor had a [[labor force|labour force]] of 625 people with a participation rate of 72.2%, much higher than the provincial average of 65.2%, and an [[unemployment]] rate of 4.6%, much lower than provincial rate at 8.5%. Of those 235 people (215 males and 15 females) are employed as tradesmen, transport and equipment operators and related occupations. Its percentage of incidence of low income was at 3.2% which was significantly lower than the 17.8% provincial average. Fort St. John, 15&nbsp;km (9&nbsp;miles) north of Taylor, offers homeless shelters and a soup kitchen which relieves Taylor of much of its incidences of low income, and also provides an alternative place of residence for employees of Taylor's industries.

The economy of Taylor is dominated by the employment generated by large industrial plants. For example, the PetroCanada Industrial Park (160 ha) has a natural gas liquids extraction plant, the [[Canfor]] Forest Products Park (65 ha) has a stud mill that specializes in small diameter logs, and the Duke Energy Inc. Park (40 ha) property processes and transports natural gas destined for Vancouver and Chicago.<ref>District of Taylor (2006) [http://www.districtoftaylor.com/itoolkit.asp?pg=About_Taylor About Taylor] Retrieved [[10 February]] [[2006]].</ref> The largest employers are West Coast Energy which is involved in natural gas and sulphur processing, Fiberco Pulp mill which runs a thermo-chemical pulp mill, Peace River Greenhouses which is a major retailer of trees and shrubs, and McMahon Co-generation plant which produce electricity from natural gas and steam turbine generators. However, since the industries are all involved in primary resources they are subject to market fluctuations. In 2004, as a result of the [[U.S.-Canada softwood lumber dispute]], Canfor shutdown its planer mill in the town.<ref>Sarah Young ([[March 26]] [[2004]]) [http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:6oNbcXCf1fIJ:www.dogwoodinitiative.org/Pages/newsroom/newsstories.php%3Ffilepath%3Dhttp://www.dogwoodinitiative.org/news_stories/archives/000324.html Canfor shuts down planer mill in Taylor] ''Alaska Highway News''</ref>

In response to the decline of the forest industry, the town has expanded its tourism industry. After the Canfor mill closure, the district established a plan to develop Peace Island Park for tourist operations. The federal Ministry of Western Economic Diversification, <ref>Western Economic Diversification Canada [[7 April]] [[2004]]) [http://www.wd.gc.ca/mediacentre/2004/apr07-01a_e.asp Government Of Canada Invests Over $23 Million In B.C. Communities Affected By Softwood Dispute]</ref> contributed $310,952 to the project.<ref>Community Futures Development Corporation - Peace Liard [http://www.communityfutures.biz/economic.html $310,952.00 Towards Aiding Taylor’s Diversification]</ref>

==Culture and recreation==
Thanks to a large industrial [[tax]] base and donations from those industries to the community, Taylor has some of the best [[recreational]] facilities in the region. Its newest facility is a multi-purpose community hall and [[Gym|gymnasium]]. This facility was constructed in 2001, specifically with wood, in support of B.C. lumber industry during the U.S.-Canada softwood lumber dispute. In the same area, in the northwest end of town, the community hall is grouped with the District Ice Center, race track ([[stock car]] and motorcross) [[baseball diamond]]s, [[curling]] rink and [[swimming pool]]. The District Ice Center, built in 1993, has two rinks, one for [[ice hockey]] and another for leisure [[skating]]. The rinks are used for [[roller hockey]] and trade shows and conventions in the summer. The curling rink has four sheets of ice and is used as a swimming pool in the summer.

The district manages an 18-hole Lone Wolf Golf Course. This 320 acre [[golf course]] opened in 1995 at a cost of $3.5 million. The course also offers a 4.2 km partially paved trail, named Participaction Trail, that meanders through an adjacent community forest and around golfing areas. In the winter the golf course and its trails are used for [[cross-country skiing]]. The district also manages Peace Island Park which is a popular spot for residents and tourists. It is a small island in the Peace River to the west of the bridge. It is used for [[camping]], [[boat launch]]es, [[fishing]], and social and private outdoor events.

Annual events in the town include a [[Dogsled racing|dogsled race]] in January or February, a [[conformation dog show]] in may, and a [[halloween]] party for kids in October. However, the most popular event is the Invitational Class 'A' [[Placer mining|Gold Panning]] Championships, which has been held in Taylor annually since 1972. This two day event in July recalls the [[gold rush]] days of the Peace River and includes advanced and amateur competitions, a parade and other communtiy-wide events.

Also, to remember its [[Cultural heritage|heritage]], several pioneer houses are preserved and used for various activities. For example, the visitor information centre and Peace Island Park meeting hall are both renovated log houses form Taylor's pioneer days. There is also a replica of [[Alexander Mackenzie|Alexander Mackenzie's]] [[birch bark]] [[canoe]] displayed in front of the visitor information center.

== Government and politics ==

The District of Taylor has a [[council-manager]] form of [[municipal government]]. A mayor, who also represents Taylor at the [[Peace River Regional District, British Columbia|Peace River Regional District]] four city councillors, and one [[Board of education|school board]] trustee, for representation on school district #60 are elected at-large every three years. In the [[19 November]] [[2005]] civic election Fred Jarvis was elected as mayor by [[acclamation]].<ref>Reaburn, Adam [http://www.fsjnow.com/?action=nc&qn=FSJN-Main_Page&idnews=2960 Municipal Election Results], ''Fort St. John Now!'', [[November 19]] [[2005]].</ref>

Taylor is situated in the [[Peace River South]] provincial electoral district and is represented by [[Blair Lekstrom]] in the [[Legislative Assembly of British Columbia]]. Lekstrom was first elected as a [[Member of the Legislative Assembly]] in the [[British Columbia general election, 2001|2001 provincial election]] taking 78% of votes cast at the Taylor polls<ref>Elections BC (2001) [http://www.elections.bc.ca/elections/sov01/pcs.pdf Peace River South Electoral District (pdf)], ''Statement of Votes, 2001'', [[November 18]] [[2005]].</ref> and he was re-elected in [[British Columbia general election, 2005|2005]] with 73% support from Taylor polls<ref name=2005prov>Elections BC (2005) [http://www.elections.bc.ca/elections/sov05/pcs.pdf Peace River South Electoral District (pdf)], ''Statement of Votes, 2005'', [[November 18]] [[2005]].</ref>. For the [[British Columbia general election, 1996|1996 election]] Taylor was part of the [[Peace River North]] provincial electoral district which elected [[Richard Neufeld]] of the [[Reform Party of British Columbia|BC Reform Party]].<ref>Elections BC (1996) [http://www.elections.bc.ca/elections/sov96/va/sov96_pcn.htm Peace River North Electoral District], ''36th Provincial General Election - May 28, 1996'', 5, [[November 17]] [[2005]].</ref>

Federally, Taylor is located in the [[Prince George—Peace River]] riding, which is represented in the [[Canadian House of Commons]] by [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]] [[Member of Parliament]] [[Jay Hill]]. Hill was first elected in 1993, then re-elected in 1997, 2000, and 2004 with 82%<ref name=97-00fed>Elections Canada [http://www.elections.ca/content.asp?section=gen&document=index&dir=rep/37d&lang=e&textonly=false 36th and 37th General Elections: Official Voting Results: Poll-by-poll Results], ''Elections Canada On-Line|General Information'', [[January 22]] [[2006]].
