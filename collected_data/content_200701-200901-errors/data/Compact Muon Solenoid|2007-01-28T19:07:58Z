The '''Compact Muon Solenoid''' ('''CMS''') experiment is one of two large general-purpose [[particle physics]] [[Particle detector|detector]]s being (as of [[2006]]) built on the [[proton|proton-proton]] [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) at [[CERN]] in [[Switzerland]].  Approximately 2300 people from 159 scientific institutes form the collaboration building it.  It will be located in an underground chamber at [[Cessy, France|Cessy]] in [[France]], just across the border from [[Geneva, Switzerland|Geneva]].  The completed detector will be cylindrical, 21 metres long and 16 metres diameter and weigh approximately 12500 tonnes.

==Goals==
The main goals of the experiment are:
* To explore physics at the [[TeV]] scale
* To discover of the [[Higgs boson]]
* To look for evidence of [[supersymmetry]]
* To be able to study aspects of heavy ion collisions

==Highlights==
The name highlights features of the detector:
* Its relatively small size
* The powerful solenoid
* Its optimization for tracking [[muon]]s

==Detector overview==
CMS is designed as a general-purpose detector, capable of studying many aspects of [[proton]] collisions at 14 TeV, the center-of-mass energy of the [[LHC]] particle accelerator.  It contains subsystems which are designed to measure the [[energy]] and [[momentum]] of [[photons]], [[electrons]], [[muons]], and other products of the collisions.  The innermost layer is a silicon-based tracker.  Surrounding it is a [[scintillating crystal]] electromagnetic [[calorimeter (particle physics)|calorimeter]], which is itself surrounded with a [[sampling calorimeter]] for hadrons.  The tracker and the calorimetry are compact enough to fit inside the CMS [[solenoid]] which generates a powerful magnetic field of 4 T.  Outside the magnet are the large muon detectors, which are inside the [[return yoke]] of the magnet.

==The electromagnetic calorimeter==
The [[electromagnetic calorimeter]] (ECAL) uses an active volume of about 80,000 [[lead tungstate]] [[crystals]] which are both extremely dense and very transparent.  [[Electrons]] and [[photons]] interact with this material and cause a shower of radiation.  This causes the crystal to scintillate, and the resulting light is picked up by [[photodetectors]] on the outside surfaces.  The resulting electronic signals are digitized and can be used to reconstruct the energy of the incident particle.

==The magnet==

Like most particle physics detectors, CMS has a large [[solenoid]].  This allows the charge/mass ratio of particles to be determined from the curved track that they follow in the magnetic field.  It is 13 metres long and 6 metres in diameter, and its refrigerated superconducting niobium-titanium coils will produce a 4-[[tesla_(unit)|tesla]] magnetic field.
