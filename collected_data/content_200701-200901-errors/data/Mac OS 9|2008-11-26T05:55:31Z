'''Mac OS 9''' is the final major release of [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] "Classic" [[Mac OS]]. Introduced on [[October 23]] [[1999]], Apple positioned it as "The Best Internet Operating System Ever," highlighting [[Apple Sherlock (software)|Sherlock 2's]] Internet search capabilities, integration with Apple's free online services known as [[.Mac|iTools]], and improved [[Open Transport]] networking.

While Mac OS 9 lacks the functionality of a modern operating system, such as [[protected memory]] and full [[pre-emptive multitasking]]<ref name="Pre-emptive Multitasking">{{Cite web|url=http://lists.apple.com/archives/Mt-smp/2001/May/msg00007.html|title=Re: newbie question: What is a Blue Task|accessdate=2007-03-29}}</ref>, lasting improvements include the introduction of an automated [[Apple Software Update|Software Update]] engine and support for [[multi-user|multiple users]].

Apple discontinued development of Mac OS 9 in 2002, transitioning all future development to [[Mac OS X]]. Since that time, no updates have been released. The final updates to Mac OS 9 addressed compatibility issues with OS X while running in the [[Classic (Mac OS X)|Classic Environment]] and compatibility with [[Carbon (computing)|Carbon]] applications.

== Features ==
Apple billed Mac OS 9 as including "50 New Features" and heavily marketed its [[Apple Sherlock (software)|Sherlock 2]] software, which introduced a 'channels' feature for searching different online resources and introduced a [[QuickTime]]-like metallic appearance. Mac OS 9 also featured integrated support for Appleâ€™s suite of Internet services known as iTools (later re-branded as [[.Mac]], which is now known as [[MobileMe]]) and included improved [[TCP/IP]] functionality with [[Open Transport]] 2.5.

Other features new to Mac OS 9 include:<ref name="Features 1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.macintouch.com/m90.html|title=Mac OS 9 Special Report|accessdate=2007-03-29}}</ref>

== Mac OS 9 and Classic ==

[[PowerPC]] versions of [[Mac OS X]] include a compatibility layer called [[Classic (Mac OS X)|Classic]], enabling users to run applications and hardware requiring Mac OS 9 from within Mac OS X. This is achieved through booting a full Mac OS 9 system. As a result, Mac OS 9 must be installed on the computer for Classic to function. Most Mac OS 9 applications run well in Classic, although some applications demonstrate screen redraw problems. In addition, scanner drivers and many other utilities no longer work.

In May 2002, at Apple's [[Worldwide Developers Conference]] in [[San Jose, California]], [[Steve Jobs]], accompanied by a [[coffin]], held a mock [[funeral]]<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cl7xQ8i3fc0 YouTube | Apple WWDC 2002-The Death Of Mac OS 9]</ref> to announce that Apple had stopped development of Mac OS 9. Mac OS 9.2.2, introduced in December 2001, was the final version of Mac OS 9, and the end of the classic Mac OS.

In June 2005, Jobs announced that the Macintosh platform would be transitioning to [[Intel x86]] microprocessors. Developer documentation of the [[Rosetta (software)|Rosetta]] PowerPC emulation layer revealed that applications written for Mac OS 8 or 9 would not run on x86-based Macs. The Classic Environment remains in the PowerPC version of Mac OS X 10.4, however x86 versions of OS X do not officially support Classic.

As a workaround for Intel-based Macs, Mac OS 9 can be emulated up to version 9.0.4 by using [[SheepShaver]], a PowerPC emulator. It cannot emulate above 9.0.4 because SheepShaver does not emulate a [[memory management unit]]. The [[PearPC]] PowerPC emulator does not support Mac OS 9.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://pearpc.sourceforge.net/faq.html | title=Frequently Asked Questions | publisher=PearPC Developers | accessdate=2006-11-16}}</ref>

Support for Classic in PowerPC versions of Mac OS X was discontinued as of [[Mac OS X v10.5]].

Updates to Mac OS 9 include 9.0.4, 9.1, 9.2.1, and 9.2.2. Mac OS 9.0.4 was a collection of bug fixes primarily relating to USB and FireWire support. OS 9.1 included integrated CD burning support in the [[Macintosh Finder]] and added a new Window menu in the Finder for switching between open windows. Mac OS 9.2, which required at least a G3 processor, increased performance noticeably.

== Availability ==
Retail copies of Mac OS 9 are still available from several Internet businesses at varying prices. Mac OS 9 is no longer available from Apple. Mac OS 9 is not yet classified as [[abandonware]], as it is still in use by those who cannot upgrade to Mac OS X due to hardware limitations, or prefer it to Mac OS X. Mac OS 9 is also a popular choice for [[retrocomputing]] hobbyists. Mac gamers also sometime revert to classic in order to play some of the earlier, nonsupported games, for example, StarEdit, the starcraft editor, or because Classic Mode does not support 3D hardware acceleration.
