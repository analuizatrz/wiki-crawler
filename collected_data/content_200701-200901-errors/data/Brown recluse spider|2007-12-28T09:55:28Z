The '''brown recluse [[spider]]''', '''''Loxosceles reclusa''''', is a well-known member of the family [[Sicariidae]] (formerly placed in a family "Loxoscelidae"). It is usually between 6–20&nbsp;[[millimetre|mm]] (¼&nbsp;[[inch|in]] and ¾&nbsp;in) but may grow larger. It is brown and sometimes an almost deep yellow color and usually has markings on the [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] side of its [[cephalothorax]], with a black line coming from it that looks like a [[violin]] with the neck of the violin pointing to the rear of the spider, resulting in the nickname "fiddleback spider" or "violin spider". Coloring varies from light tan to brown and the violin marking may not be visible.

==Description==
Since the "violin pattern" is not diagnostic, and other spiders may have similar marking (i.e. cellar spiders (family [[Pholcidae]]) and pirate spiders (family [[Mimetidae]])), for purposes of identification it is far more important to examine the eyes.  Differing from most spiders, which have eight eyes, recluse spiders have six eyes arranged in pairs ([[dyad]]s) with one [[median]] pair and two [[Human anatomical terms#Anatomical directions|lateral]] pairs. Only a few other spiders have 3 pairs of eyes arranged this way (e.g., [[Scytodidae|scytodids]]), and recluses can be distinguished from these as recluse abdomens have no coloration pattern nor do their legs, which also lack spines.<ref name="DermatolOnlineJ1999-Vetter">{{cite journal | author = Vetter R | title = Identifying and misidentifying the brown recluse spider | journal = Dermatol Online J | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 7 | year = 1999 | id = PMID 10673460 | url=http://dermatology.cdlib.org/DOJvol5num2/special/recluse.html}}</ref> 

==Habitat==
Recluse spiders build irregular webs that frequently include a shelter consisting of disorderly threads. These spiders frequently build their webs in woodpiles and sheds, closets, garages, cellars and other places that are dry and generally undisturbed.  They seem to favor cardboard when dwelling in human residences, possibly because it mimics the rotting tree bark which they naturally inhabit.  They also go in shoes, inside dressers, in bed sheets of infrequently used beds, in stacks of clothes, behind baseboards, behind pictures and near furnaces.  The common source of human-recluse contact is during the cleaning of these spaces, when their isolated spaces suddenly are disturbed and the spider feels threatened. Unlike most web weavers, they leave these webs at night to hunt. Males will move around more when hunting while females don't usually stray far from their web.  

==Distribution==
The brown recluse spider is native to the [[United States]] from the southern [[Midwest]] south to the [[Gulf of Mexico]].<ref>{{cite web | author=Jone SC | title=Ohio State University Fact Sheet: Brown Recluse Spider | url=http://ohioline.osu.edu/hyg-fact/2000/2061.html | accessdate=2006-09-02}}</ref> The native range lies roughly south of a line from southeastern [[Nebraska]] through southern [[Iowa]], [[Illinois]], and [[Indiana]] to southwestern [[Ohio]]. In the southern states, it is native from central [[Texas]] to western [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].  They are generally not found west of the [[Rocky Mountains]].<ref name="NEJM2005-Vetter">{{cite journal | author = Swanson D, Vetter R | title = Bites of brown recluse spiders and suspected necrotic arachnidism. | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 352 | issue = 7 | pages = 700-7 | year = 2005 | id = PMID 15716564}}</ref> A related species, the [[brown violin spider]] (''Loxosceles rufescens''), is found in [[Hawaii]].<ref name="">{{cite web | last = Kuwaye | first = Todd T. | title = Case Based Pediatrics for Medical Students and Residents | url = http://www.hawaii.edu/medicine/pediatrics/pedtext/s21c05.html | accessdate = 2006-12-10}}</ref>

==Venomous bite==
[[Image:brown_recluse.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Brown recluse on a quarter (Photo courtesy of the University of Nebraska)]]

As indicated by [[recluse|its name]], this spider is not aggressive and usually bites only when pressed against the skin, such as when tangled up within clothes, bath towels, or in bedding.<ref name="AnnEmergMed2002-Vetter">{{cite journal | author = Vetter R, Bush S | title = The diagnosis of brown recluse spider bite is overused for dermonecrotic wounds of uncertain etiology | journal = Ann Emerg Med | volume = 39 | issue = 5 | pages = 544-6 | year = 2002 | id = PMID 11973562}}</ref> In fact, many wounds that are necrotic and diagnosed as brown recluse bites can actually be [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus]] (MRSA). Actual brown recluse bites are rare. Brown recluse bites may produce a range of symptoms known as [[loxoscelism]]. There are two types of loxoscelism: [[cutaneous]] (skin) and systemic (viscerocutaneous).
 
Most bites are minor with no [[necrosis]].  However, a small number of bites produce severe dermonecrotic lesions, and, sometimes, severe systemic symptoms, including organ damage. Rarely, the bite may also produce a systemic condition with occasional fatalities. Most fatalities are in [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6209004/ children under 7] or those with a weaker than normal immune system. (For a comparison of the toxicity of several kinds of spider bites, see the list of [[Spider bite#Types_of_spiders_with_medically_significant_venom|spiders having medically significant venom]].)

A minority of brown recluse spider bites form a necrotizing [[ulcer]] that destroys soft tissue and may take months to heal, leaving deep [[scar]]s.  The damaged tissue will become [[gangrene|gangrenous]] and eventually slough away. The initial bite frequently cannot be felt and there may be no pain, but over time the wound may grow to as large as 10 inches (25 cm) in extreme cases.  Bites usually become painful and itchy within 2 to 8 hours, pain and other local effects worsen 12 to 36 hours after the bite with the necrosis developing over the next few days.<ref name="ClinTox-Wasserman">{{cite journal | author = Wasserman G, Anderson P | title = Loxoscelism and necrotic arachnidism | journal = J Toxicol Clin Toxicol | volume = 21 | issue = 4-5 | pages = 451-72 | year =1983-1984 | id = PMID 6381752}}</ref>

Serious systemic effects may occur before this time, as the venom spreads throughout the body in minutes. Mild symptoms include [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[fever]], [[rash]]es, and muscle and joint pain. Rarely more severe symptoms occur including [[hemolysis]], [[thrombocytopenia]], and [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]].<ref name="NEJM2005-Wasserman">{{cite journal | author = Wasserman G | title = Bites of the brown recluse spider. | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 352 | issue = 19 | pages = 2029-30; author reply 2029-30 | year = 2005 | id = PMID 15892198}}</ref> Debilitated patients, the elderly, and children may be more susceptible to systemic loxoscelism.

Numerous other spiders have been associated with necrotic bites in the medical literature.  A partial list includes the [[hobo spider]], the [[white-tailed spider]], and the [[yellow sac spider]]s.  However, the bites from these spiders are not known to produce the severe symptoms that often follow from a recluse spider bite, and the level of danger posed by each has been called into question.<ref>

There have been several studies questioning danger posed by some of these spiders.  In these studies, scientists examined case studies of bites in which the spider in question was positively identified by an expert, and found that the incidence of necrotic injury diminished significantly when "questionable" identifications were excluded from the sample set.<ref name="WhiteTail">

==Bite treatment==
<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Loxrec.gif|220px|thumbnail|right|Close up picture of a brown recluse spider.]] -->
First aid involves the application of an ice pack to control [[inflammation]], the application of aloe vera to soothe and help control the pain, and prompt medical care. If it can be easily captured, the spider should be brought with the patient in a clear, tightly closed container so it may be identified.  However, by the time the bite is noticed any spider found nearby is not likely to be the culprit.

There is no established treatment for [[necrosis]]. Routine treatment should include elevation and immobilization of the affected limb, application of ice, local wound care, and tetanus prophylaxis. Many other therapies have been used with varying degrees of success including [[hyperbaric oxygen]], [[dapsone]], antihistamines (e.g., [[cyproheptadine]]), [[antibiotics]], [[dextran]], [[glucocorticoids]], vasodilators, [[heparin]], [[nitroglycerin]], [[electric shock]], [[curettage]], [[surgery|surgical excision]], and [[antivenom]]. None of these treatments have been subjected to controlled, randomized trials to conclusively show benefit. In almost all cases, bites are self-limited and typically heal without any medical intervention.<ref name="NEJM2005-Vetter"/>

It is important to seek medical treatment if a brown recluse bite is suspected, as in the rare cases of necrosis the effects can quickly spread, particularly when the venom reaches a blood vessel.  Cases of brown recluse venom traveling along a limb through a vein or artery are rare, but the resulting mortification of the tissue can affect an area as large as several inches, to the extreme of requiring excising of the wound.  While it is possible, and even likely, that many cases of "brown recluse bites" are indeed misidentifications of other infections or envenemations, the brown recluse has justly earned its reputation.

===Specific treatments===
[[Dapsone]] is commonly used in the [[USA]] and [[Brazil]] for the treatment of necrosis. There have been conflicting reports about its efficacy and some have suggested it should no longer be used routinely, if at all.<ref name="AmJEmergMed2003-Bryant">{{cite journal | author = Bryant S, Pittman L | title = Dapsone use in Loxosceles reclusa envenomation: is there an indication? | journal = Am J Emerg Med | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 89-90 | year = 2003 | id = PMID 12563594}}</ref>

Wound infection is rare. Antibiotics are not recommended unless there is a credible diagnosis of infection.<ref name="MoMed1998-Anderson">{{cite journal | author = Anderson P | title = Missouri brown recluse spider: a review and update | journal = Mo Med | volume = 95 | issue = 7 | pages = 318-22 | year = 1998 | id = PMID 9666677}}</ref>

Studies have shown surgical intervention is ineffective and may worsen outcome. Excision may delay wound healing, cause [[abscesses]], and lead to objectional scarring.<ref name="AnnSurg1985-Rees">{{cite journal | author = Rees R, Altenbern D, Lynch J, King L | title = Brown recluse spider bites. A comparison of early surgical excision versus dapsone and delayed surgical excision | journal = Ann Surg | volume = 202 | issue = 5 | pages = 659-63 | year = 1985 | id = PMID 4051613}}</ref>

[[Anecdotal evidence]] suggests benefit can be gained with the application of [[Glyceryl trinitrate#Uses|nitroglycerin]] patches.<ref>{{cite web | author=Burton K |title=The Brown Recluse Spider: Finally stopped in its tracks | url=http://www.geocities.com/Yosemite/Forest/2021/recluse/intro.html | accessdate=2006-09-02}}</ref> The brown recluse venom is a vasoconstrictor, and nitroglycerin causes [[vasodilation]], allowing the venom to be diluted into the bloodstream, and fresh blood to flow to the wound. Theoretically this prevents necrosis, as vasoconstriction may contribute to necrosis. However, one scientific animal study found no benefit in preventing necrosis, with results showing it increased inflammation and it caused symptoms of systemic envenoming. The authors concluded the results of the study did not support the use of topical nitroglycerin in brown recluse envenoming.<ref name="AnnEmergMed2001-Lowry">{{cite journal | author = Lowry B, Bradfield J, Carroll R, Brewer K, Meggs W | title = A controlled trial of topical nitroglycerin in a New Zealand white rabbit model of brown recluse spider envenomation | journal = Ann Emerg Med | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 161-5 | year = 2001 | id = PMID 11174233}}</ref>

Antivenom, available in South America, appears to be the most promising therapy. However, antivenoms are most effective if given early and because of the painless bite patients do not often present until 24 or more hours after the event, possibly limiting the effect of this intervention.<ref name="ClinTox2003-Isbister">{{cite journal | author = Isbister G, Graudins A, White J, Warrell D | title = Antivenom treatment in arachnidism | journal = J Toxicol Clin Toxicol | volume = 41 | issue = 3 | pages = 291-300 | year = 2003 | id = PMID 12807312}}</ref>

==Misdiagnoses==
It is estimated that 80% of reported brown recluse bites may be misdiagnosed. The misdiagnosis of a wound as a brown recluse bite could delay proper treatment of serious diseases.<ref name="NEJM2005-Vetter"/>  There is now a [[ELISA]]-based test for brown recluse venom that can determine if a wound is a brown recluse bite, although it is not commercially available and not in routine use.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Gomez H, Krywko D, Stoecker W | title = A new assay for the detection of Loxosceles species (brown recluse) spider venom | journal = Ann Emerg Med | volume = 39 | issue = 5 | pages = 469-74 | year = 2002 | id = PMID 11973553}}</ref><ref name="NEJM2005-Vetter">{{cite journal | author = Swanson D, Vetter R | title = Bites of brown recluse spiders and suspected necrotic arachnidism. | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 352 | issue = 7 | pages = 700-7 | year = 2005 | id = PMID 15716564}}</ref>

There are numerous documented infectious and noninfectious conditions (including [[pyoderma gangrenosum]], bacterial infections by ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' and ''[[Streptococcus]]'', [[herpes]], diabetic ulcer, fungal infections, chemical burns, [[toxicodendron]] dermatitis, [[squamous cell carcinoma]], localized [[vasculitis]], [[syphilis]], [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]], [[sporotrichosis]], and [[Lyme disease]]) that produce wounds that have been initially misdiagnosed as recluse bites by medical professionals; many of these conditions are far more common and more likely to be the source of mysterious necrotic wounds, even in areas where recluses actually occur.<ref name="NEJM2005-Vetter"/>

Reported cases of bites occur primarily in [[Arkansas]], [[Texas]], [[Kansas]], [[Missouri]], [[Colorado]], and [[Oklahoma]].  There have been many reports of brown recluse bites in [[California]] (and elsewhere outside the range of the brown recluse); however the brown recluse is not found in California<ref>{{cite web | author=Vetter R |title=Myth of the Brown Recluse: Fact, Fear, and Loathing | url=http://spiders.ucr.edu/myth.html | accessdate=2006-09-02}}</ref> (though a few related species may be found there, none of which has been shown to bite humans). To date, the reports of bites from areas outside of the spider's native range have been either unverified, or - if verified - specimens moved by travelers or commerce. Gertsch and Ennik (1983) report that occasional spiders have been intercepted in various locations where they have no known established populations; [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Florida]], [[Maine]], [[Minnesota]], [[New Jersey]], [[Mexico]], [[New York]], [[North Carolina]], [[Wyoming]] and [[Tamaulipas]] (Mexico),<ref>[http://creatures.ifas.ufl.edu/urban/spiders/brown_recluse_spider.htm] University of Florida Fact Sheet</ref> which indicates that these spiders may indeed be transported fairly easily, though the lack of established populations well outside the natural range also indicates that such movement does not lead to colonization of new areas. Many arachnologists believe that many bites attributed to the brown recluse in the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] are not spider bites at all, or possibly instead the bites of other spider species; for example, the bite of the [[hobo spider]] has been reported to produce similar symptoms, and is found in the northwestern [[United States]] and southern [[British Columbia]] in Canada. However, the toxicity of the hobo spider has been called into question as bites have not  been proven to cause necrosis, and the spider is not considered a problem in its native [[Europe]].<ref name="AnnEmergMed2004-Isbister">{{cite journal | author = Vetter R, Isbister G | title = Do hobo spider bites cause dermonecrotic injuries? | journal = Ann Emerg Med | volume = 44 | issue = 6 | pages = 605-7 | year = 2004 | id = PMID 15573036}}</ref> In addition, published work has shown that [[tick]]-induced [[Lyme disease]] rashes are often misidentified as brown recluse spider bites.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Osterhoudt KC, Zaoutis T, Zorc JJ |title=Lyme disease masquerading as brown recluse spider bite |journal=Annals of emergency medicine |volume=39 |issue=5 |pages=558-61 |year=2002 |pmid=11973566 |doi=}}</ref>
