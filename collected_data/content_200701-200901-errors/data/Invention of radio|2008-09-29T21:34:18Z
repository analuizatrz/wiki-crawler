Within the [[timeline of radio]], several people were involved in the '''invention of radio''' and there were many key inventions in what became the modern systems of [[wireless]].<ref name="inventorsaboutcom"> [http://inventors.about.com/od/rstartinventions/a/radio.htm The Invention of Radio] inventors.about.com/od/rstartinventions/a/radio.htm </ref> [[Radio]] development began as "[[wireless telegraphy]]".<ref name="inventorsaboutcom" /> Closely related, radio was developed along with two other key inventions, the [[telegraph]] and the [[telephone]].<ref name="inventorsaboutcom">[http://inventors.about.com/od/rstartinventions/a/radio.htm The Invention of Radio] inventors.about.com/od/rstartinventions/a/radio.htm </ref>  During the early development of wireless technology and long after its wide use, disputes persisted as to who could claim credit for the invention of radio. The matter was important for economic, political and nationalistic reasons.

==Physics of wireless signaling==
Several different electrical, magnetic, or electromagnetic physical phenomena can be adapted to transmission of signals over a distance without intervening wires. The various methods  for wireless signal transmissions include:
*[[Electrical Conduction]] through the ground,<ref>Electrical current can be injected into the earth and switched on and off; the resulting voltage gradients can be detected at a distance and used for signals. In some cases naturally-occuring currents in the earth can be altered for similar effects. Electrodes placed in a stream or lake can also be used to inject currents.</ref> through the water, or through the air<ref> This includes, but is not limited to, ionization, and [[electrostatic field]]s.</ref>
*[[Electromagnetic induction|Magnetic induction]] 
*[[Capacitive coupling]]
*[[Electromagnetic radiation|Electromagnetic waves]] <ref>Such waves are usually systematically altered (by modulation) to carry signals.</ref>
All these physical phenomena have been tested for purposes of communication. Early researchers may not even have understood or disclosed which physical effects were responsible for transmitting signals. Early experiments used the existing theories of the movement of charged particles through an electrical conductor.  There was no theory of electromagnetic wave propagation to guide experiments before Maxwell's treatise and verification by Hertz and others.

Capacitive and inductive coupling systems today are used only for short-range special purpose systems. The physical phenomenon most widely used today for long-distance communications involves the theory of modulation of electromagnetic waves.

==Early theories and experiments==
Several scientists speculated that light might be some kind of wave connected with electricity or magnetism. Around 1830 [[Francesco Zantedeschi]] suggested a connection between light, electricity, and magnetism .<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_%281913%29/Francesco_Zantedeschi  |title=Francesco Zantedeschi article at the Catholic Encyclopedia|accessdate=2007-06-16 |last=Brother Potamian |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year=1913  |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Wikisource  |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> In 1832 [[Joseph Henry]] performed experiments detecting electromagnetic effects over a distance of 200 feet and postulated the existence of electromagnetic waves. In 1846 [[Michael Faraday]] speculated that light was a wave disturbance in a force field".<ref>{{cite web | author = Baggott, Jim | title = The myth of Michael Faraday: Michael Faraday was not just one of Britain's greatest experimenters. A closer look at the man and his work reveals that he was also a clever theoretician | journal = New Scientist | date = 2 September 1991 | pages = | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg13117874.600-the-myth-of-michael-faraday-michael-faraday-was-not-justone-of-britains-greatest-experimenters-a-closer-look-at-the-man-and-hiswork-reveals-that-he-was-also-a-clever-theoretician-.html | accessdate = 2008-09-06 }}</ref>

Based on the experimental work of [[Faraday]] and other physicists, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] developed a theory of electromagnetism that predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves. He did not transmit or receive radio waves.

==Innovations and laboratory experiments==
===Hughes===
In 1879, during experiments with his induction balance, [[David E. Hughes]] transmitted signals which he attributed to electromagnetic waves. Hughes' contemporaries claimed that the detected effects were due to [[electromagnetic induction]]. Hughes used his apparatus to transmit Morse code using a transmitter controlled by clockwork.

===Hertz===
[[Heinrich Rudolf Hertz]] was the experimental physicist who confirmed Maxwell's work in the laboratory.<ref>Massie, W. W., & Underhill, C. R. (1911). [http://books.google.com/books?id=6_RUAAAAMAAJ Wireless telegraphy and telephony popularly explained]. New York: D. Van Nostrand. </ref> Hertz, though, did not devise a system for actual general use nor describe the application of the technology. From 1886 to 1888 inclusive, in his [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] experiments, he showed that the properties of radio waves were consistent with Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory. He demonstrated that radio radiation had all the properties of waves (now called [[electromagnetic radiation]]), and discovered that the electromagnetic equations could be reformulated into a [[partial differential equation]] called the [[wave equation]].

Hertz’s setup for a source and detector of radio waves (then called Hertzian waves<ref>[http://earlyradiohistory.us/1901hz.htm ''Hertzian Waves'' (1901)] Accessed 2008-08-11</ref> or Hertz waves in his honor), comprised a primitive radio system capable of transmitting and receiving [[radio waves]] through [[free space]].<ref>[http://www.tfcbooks.com/mainpage/glossary.htm#hertz_wave Hertz wave]</ref> His transmitter was not at all efficient and was severely limited in power output. He used what is today called a [[hertz antenna]] (with the other forms being the [[Marconi antenna]] and [[Tesla antenna]]). Its dipole antenna differed from the vertical quarter-wavelength antenna that was subsequently adopted by Marconi and others in that it was not grounded.<ref> Peterson, Gary, "''[http://www.tfcbooks.com/articles/tws09.htm Comparing the Hertz-wave and Tesla wireless systems]''". Feed Line No. 9 Article</ref>
	 
Hertz used the damped oscillating currents in a dipole antenna, triggered by a high-voltage electrical capacitive spark discharge, as his source of radio waves. His detector in some experiments was another dipole antenna connected to a narrow spark gap. A small spark in this gap signified detection of the radio waves. When he added cylindrical reflectors behind his dipole antennas, Hertz could detect radio waves about 20 metres from the [[transmitter]] in his [[laboratory]]. He did not try to transmit further because he wanted to prove [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] theory, not to develop wireless [[communication]]s.

Hertz seemed uninterested in the practical importance of his experiments. He stated that "''It's of no use whatsoever ... this is just an experiment that proves Maestro [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] was right - we just have these mysterious electromagnetic waves that we cannot see with the naked eye. But they are there''."<ref name="katz"> Eugenii Katz, "''[http://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/~eugeniik/history/hertz.htm Heinrich Rudolf Hertz]''". Biographies of Famous Electrochemists and Physicists Contributed to Understanding of Electricity, Biosensors & Bioelectronics.</ref> 	 

Asked about the ramifications of his discoveries, Hertz replied, "''Nothing, I guess''." Hertz also stated,  "I do not think that the wireless waves I have discovered will have any practical application."<ref name="katz" /> Hertz died in 1894, so the art of radio was left to others to implement into a practical useful form. His discoveries would later be taken up by entrepreneurs looking to make their fortunes. Marconi's 1895 experiments followed Hertz's work (among others') by using a spark source in what became known as a [[spark-gap transmitter]].

===Tesla===
Around July 1891, [[Nikola Tesla]] constructed various apparatus that produced between 15,000 to 18,000 cycles per second. Transmission and radiation of radio frequency energy was a feature exhibited in the experiments by Tesla which he proposed might be used for the [[telecommunication]] of [[information]].<ref>"''[http://www.tfcbooks.com/tesla/1893-02-24.htm On Light and Other High Frequency Phenomena]''". Delivered before the Franklin Institute, Philadelphia, February 1893, and before the National Electric Light Association, St. Louis, March 1893.</ref><ref>"''[http://www.tfcbooks.com/tesla/1892-02-03.htm Experiments with Alternating Currents of High Potential and High Frequency]''". Delivered before the Institution of Electrical Engineers, London, February 1892.</ref> 

After 1892, Tesla delivered a widely reported presentation before the [[Institution of Electrical Engineers]] of London in which he suggested that messages could be transmitted without wires. Later, a variety of Tesla's radio frequency systems were demonstrated during another widely known lecture, presented to meetings of the [[National Electric Light Association]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] and the [[Franklin Institute]] in [[Philadelphia]]. According to the [[IEEE]], "''the apparatus that he employed contained all the elements of spark and continuous wave that were incorporated into radio transmitters before the advent of the vacuum tube''".<ref name="IEEE History Center">"''[http://www.ieee.org/web/aboutus/history_center/biography/tesla.html Nikola Tesla, 1856 - 1943]''". IEEE History Center, IEEE, 2003.</ref> However, "''he almost perversely rejected the notion of transmission by Hertzian waves, which he considered to be wasteful of energy.''"<ref name="IEEE History Center" /><ref>Martin, T. C., & Tesla, N. (1894). [http://books.google.com/books?id=bhrreukJiLgC The inventions, researches and writings of Nikola Tesla, with special reference to his work in polyphase currents and high potential lighting]. New York: The Electrical Engineer.</ref><ref>[[wikisource:The True Wireless|The True Wireless]], Electrical Experimenter, May 1919, pages 28-30, 61-63, 87.</ref> Wireless transmissions could be done by [[transverse wave|transverse "Hertzian" waves]] with his devices acting as a [[Radiator#Electronics|radiator]], but Tesla preferred the use of [[longitudinal wave]]s and set up [[standing wave|standing]] [[surface wave]]s through [[resonance]]. In between the Earth and the ionosphere, a cavity exists to set up longitudinal waves (see [[cavity resonator]] for more on this concept).

===Bose===
[[Image:J.C.Bose.JPG|thumb|[[Jagdish Chandra Bose]] in his lab.]]
In November 1894, the [[Bengali people|Bengali]] [[Undivided India|Indian]] physicist, [[Jagdish Chandra Bose]], demonstrated publicly the use of radio waves in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], but he was not interested in patenting his work.<ref>"[http://www.ieee-virtual-museum.org/collection/people.php?taid=&id=1234735&lid=1 Jagadish Chandra Bose]". ieee-virtual-museum.org.</ref> In 1894, Bose ignited [[gunpowder]] and rang a bell at a distance using [[electromagnetic]] waves, showing independently that communication signals can be sent without using wires. In 1896, the [[Daily Chronicle]] of England reported on his UHF experiments: "''The inventor (J.C. Bose) has transmitted signals to a distance of nearly a mile and herein lies the first and obvious and exceedingly valuable application of this new theoretical marvel.''" The 1895 public demonstration by Bose in [[Calcutta]] was before Marconi's wireless signalling experiment on [[Salisbury Plain]] in England in May 1897.<ref>"''[http://www.tuc.nrao.edu/~demerson/bose/bose.html The Work of Jagdish Chandra Bose: 100 years of mm-wave research]''". tuc.nrao.edu.</ref><ref>"''[http://www.ieee-virtual-museum.org/collection/people.php?taid=&id=1234735&lid=1 Jagadish Chandra Bose]''", ieee-virtual-museum.org.</ref> Bose did his demonstration shortly after Tesla had performed radio communication earlier in 1892 and 1893.

Bose was not interested in the commercial applications of the experiment's transmitter. He did not try to file [[patent]] protection for sending signals. In 1899, Bose announced the development of a "''iron-mercury-iron [[coherer]] with [[telephone]] detector''" in a paper presented at the [[Royal Society]], London.<ref>Bondyopadhyay, Probir K., "''Sir J. C. Bose's Diode Detector Received Marconi's First Transatlantic Wireless Signal Of December 1901 (The "Italian Navy Coherer" Scandal Revisited)''". Proc. IEEE, Vol. 86, No. 1, January 1988.</ref> 	Later he received {{US patent|755840}}, "''Detector for electrical disturbances''" (1904), for a specific electromagnetic receiver.

==Early Commercial exploitation == 
===Edison===
In 1885, [[Thomas Alva Edison|T. A. Edison]] used a vibrator magnet for induction transmission. In 1888, he deployed a system of signaling on the Lehigh Valley Railroad. In 1892, Edison attained the wireless patent for this method using inductance ({{US patent|465971}}).

===Tesla===

====Radio frequency generation====
The [[electromechanical]] engineer [[Nikola Tesla]], who has been called called the ''father of [[wireless telegraphy]]'',<ref name="JohnsonAndBrown">Johnson, R., & Brown, J. H. (1904). "[http://books.google.com/books?id=Ou4UAAAAYAAJ&pg=PT122&source=gbs_search_s Nikola Tesla]", [http://books.google.com/books?id=Ou4UAAAAYAAJ The twentieth century biographical dictionary of notable Americans]. Boston: Biographical Society. (cf., He was called the father of wireless telegraphy, which theory he first described in a lecture before the National Electric Light association at St. Louis, Mo., March, 1893; his ideas being given practical demonstration by Marconi in 1902.)</ref> was one of the first to patent a means to reliably produce radio frequency waves. Tesla's {{US patent|447920}}, "''Method of Operating Arc-Lamps''" ([[March 10]], [[1891]]), describes an [[alternator]] that produced high-frequency (for that time period) current of around 10,000 hertz.  His innovation was suppression of the sound produced by arc lamps that were operated on alternating or pulsating current by using frequencies beyond the range of human hearing. The alternator produced frequencies in the [[Very Low Frequency]] (VLF) range.

====Continued research and patents====
Early on in his research [[Nikola Tesla|Tesla]] used his high voltage resonance transformer — the [[Tesla coil]]<ref>{{US patent|454622}}, June 23, 1891 (ed., This patent is cited in [http://books.google.com/books?id=_qtRAAAAMAAJ Maver's Wireless Telegraphy] by William Maver on [http://books.google.com/books?id=_qtRAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA165&lr=&as_brr=1&ei=vd2hSLOuIaa6jgHC2sj6BA#PPA165,M1 Page 165].)</ref> — in radio-wave propagation experiments.  The [[Antenna (radio)#Antenna parameters|aerial]] consisted of a top-loaded electrical conductor that was connected to a high-voltage terminal of the transformer.  The opposing high-voltage terminal was grounded.  The secondary winding was driven by a primary circuit consisting of a few turns of heavy wire, a capacitor bank, a circuit controller, and a power supply transformer.  The launching structure could be operated as a electromagnetic radiator (or "Hertz wave antenna") or a large scale electromagnetic resonator.  

Between 1895 and 1899, Tesla received wireless signals transmitted from actions at long distances.<ref>One such path was from his [[Houston Street (Manhattan)|Houston street]] lab in New York City to a receiving location at [[West Point, New York|West Point]].</ref><ref name="ChildressTesla" /> After 1896, the transmitter consisted of an RF alternator and produced [[Continuous wave|undamped (or continuous) waves]] [[Low frequency|in the neighborhood of 50,000 cycles per second]].<ref>Nikola Tesla On His Work With Alternating Currents and Their Application to Wireless Telegraphy, Telephony and Transmission of Power : An Extended Interview. Chapter IV ISBN 1-893817-01-6 (cf., [Counsel] What do you mean by high frequencies?<br>[Tesla] I mean frequencies of 30,000, 40,000, 50,000, or something like that. <br>
[Counsel] And by means of that machine, you put undamped waves of frequency about 50,000 into that antenna at Houston Street in 1895?<br>[Tesla] No [with that machine], not in 1895.

The wire was placed within the magnetic field, and in conjunction with the condensers formed a tuned circuit.<ref>"Nikola Tesla On His  Work with Alternating Currents and Their Application to wireless Telegraphy, Telephony, and Transmission of Power", Leland I.

Early on in his research Tesla used his high voltage resonance transformer — the [[Tesla coil]]<ref>{{US patent|454622}}, June 23, 1891 (ed., This patent is cited in [http://books.google.com/books?id=_qtRAAAAMAAJ Maver's Wireless Telegraphy] by William Maver on [http://books.google.com/books?id=_qtRAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA165&lr=&as_brr=1&ei=vd2hSLOuIaa6jgHC2sj6BA#PPA165,M1 Page 165].)</ref> — in radio-wave propagation experiments.  The [[Antenna (radio)#Antenna parameters|aerial]] consisted of a top-loaded electrical conductor that was connected to a high-voltage terminal of the transformer.  The opposing high-voltage terminal was grounded.  The secondary winding was driven by a primary circuit consisting of a few turns of heavy wire, a capacitor bank, a circuit controller, and a power supply transformer.  The launching structure radiated as a common "Hertz wave" antenna.  In Tesla's own words, 
<blockquote>"The popular impression is that my wireless work was begun in 1893, but as a matter of fact I spent the two preceding years in investigations, employing forms of apparatus, some of which were almost like those of today. . . ."<ref>"''[http://www.tfcbooks.com/tesla/1919-05-00.htm The True Wireless]''"</ref></blockquote>

After a while he began to favor another technique that he called the “disturbed charge of ground and air method.”  Tesla's wireless system used the same basic apparatus, however instead of using electromagnetic space waves the energy is carried by the resonation of electrical currents through the earth and along with accompanying surface waves.  In one form of the system the ‘return’ path closing the circuit is an electrical current flow established between two elevated terminals, one belonging to the transmitter and the other the receiver.  These consist of currents flowing through plasma and also electrostatic waves.  Once again in Tesla's own words,
<blockquote>"... It was clear to me from the very start that the successful consummation could only be brought about by a number of radical improvements.  Suitable high frequency generators and electrical oscillators had first to be produced.  The energy of these had to be transformed in effective transmitters and collected at a distance in proper receivers.  Such a system would be manifestly circumscribed in its usefulness if all extraneous interference were not prevented and exclusiveness secured.  In time, however, I recognized that devices of this kind, to be most effective and efficient, should be designed with due regard to the physical properties of this planet and the electrical conditions obtaining on the same ..."<ref>"''[http://www.tfcbooks.com/tesla/1919-05-00.htm ibid]''"</ref></blockquote>
In other words, Tesla’s structure injected a large alternating current into the earth via the ground terminal. Tesla's discovery of importance was the "[[Surface wave]]" method. The production of surface waves as described by Arnold Sommerfeld and Jonathan Zenneck was partially the consequence of adding a deep ground connection to the transmitter. Tesla said in 1893 that "''One of the terminals of the source would be connected to Earth ''[as a [[Ground (electricity)|electric ground connection]] ...]'' the other to an insulated body of large surface''.<ref>"''[http://www.tfcbooks.com/tesla/1893-02-24.htm On Light and Other High Frequency Phenomena]''". Delivered before the Franklin Institute, Philadelphia, February 1893, and before the National Electric Light Association, St. Louis, March 1893.</ref>  

A shallow buried ground plane or an elevated insulated counterpoise is commonly used in the construction of low and medium frequency 1/4-wavelength radio antennas.  These lend to the development of the Norton Surface Wave. This method led to longer transmission ranges. Many AM stations use this same principle to boost reception of their signals.<ref name=bickel>[http://www.fcc.gov/mb/audio/bickel/daytime.html Why AM Radio Stations Must Reduce Power, Change Operations, or Cease Operations at Night] fcc.gov</ref> This also allows modern grounded AM 1/4 wavelength monopole antennas to be more practical in order to overcome the restrictions imposed upon designers by the large physical dimensions required for these structures.

Radio antennas radiate electromagnetic waves that can reach the receiver either by ground-wave propagation or by refraction from the ionosphere, known as sky-wave propagation.  The ground-wave component is the portion of the radiated electromagnetic wave that propagates close to the earth's surface.  It has both direct-wave and ground-reflected components, and under certain conditions a tropospheric ducting component.  The direct-wave is limited only by the distance from the transmitter to the horizon plus a small distance added by atmospheric diffraction around the curvature of the earth.  The ground-reflected portion of the radiated wave reaches the receiving antenna after being reflected from the earth's surface.  A portion of the ground-wave energy radiated by the antenna may also be guided by the earth's surface as a ground-hugging [[surface wave]].

Nikola Tesla was issued the following radio patents:
* {{US patent|645576}}, "System of Transmission of Electrical Energy" (March 20, 1900; filed Sept. 2, 1897). In US645576, Tesla cited the well-known radiant energy phenomena and corrected previous errors in theory of behavior. Within this specification, Tesla declared, "The apparatus which I have shown will obviously have many other valuable uses - as, for instance, when it is desired to transmit intelligible messages to great distances [...]".
* {{US patent|649621}}, "Apparatus for Transmission of Electrical Energy" (May 15, 1900; filed February 19, 1900). In US649621, Tesla established a system which was composed of a transmitting coil (or conductor) arranged and excited to cause oscillations (or currents) to propagate via conduction through the natural medium from one point to another remote point therefrom and a receiver coil, or conductor, of the transmitted signals.

In 1911, Tesla would assist in the construction of the [[Telefunken]] station at West Sayville, New York. This station of three 600-foot (180-m) radio towers and another station, erected in Nauen, created the only wireless communication between North America and Europe.

===Popov===
Beginning in the early 1890s, [[Alexander Stepanovich Popov]] conducted experiments along the lines of Hertz's research. In 1894 he built his first [[radio receiver]], which contained a [[coherer]]. Further refined as a  [[lightning detector]], he presented it to the [[Russian Physical and Chemical Society]] on [[May 7]], [[1895]] &mdash; the day has been celebrated in the Russian Federation as "[[Radio Day]]". The paper on his findings was published the same year ([[December 15]] 1895). Popov had recorded, at the end of 1895, that he was hoping for distant signaling with radio waves.<ref> D.T. Emerson, "[http://www.tuc.nrao.edu/~demerson/bose/bose.html The work of Jagadis Chandra Bose: 100 years of mm-wave research]". National Radio Astronomy Observatory, February 1998.</ref> In 1900, Popov stated (in front of the [[Congress of Russian Electrical Engineers]]), 
: "[...]'' the emission and reception of signals by Marconi by means of electric oscillations ''[was]'' nothing new. In America, the famous engineer [[Nikola Tesla]] carried the same experiments in 1893''."<ref>"''The Guglielmo Marconi Case;  [http://web.archive.org/web/20080113034042/http://www.mercury.gr/tesla/marcen.html Who is the True Inventor of Radio]''".</ref>

===Marconi===
====Early years====
[[Image:Marconi.jpg|thumb|right|222px|Guglielmo Marconi : Italian-Irish electrical engineer and Nobel laureate known for the development of a practical wireless telegraphy system.]]
[[Guglielmo Marconi]], who has been called called the ''father of radio'',<ref>Gunston, D. (1965). Guglielmo Marconi, father of radio. London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson.</ref> is said to have read about the [[Heinrich_Hertz#Electromagnetic_research|experiments that Hertz did in the 1880s]] while he was on vacation in 1894 and about Nikola Tesla's work in the just-published book ''[[Inventions, Researches and Writings of Nikola Tesla]]''. It was at this time that Marconi began to understand that radio waves could be used for wireless communications.<ref>Henry M. Bradford, "''[http://www.newscotland1398.net/marconi100/marconi1.html Marconi's Three]; Transatlantic Radio Stations In Cape Breton''". Read before the Royal [[Nova Scotia]] Historical Society, [[31 January]] [[1996]]. (''ed''. the site is reproduced with permission from the ''Royal Nova Scotia Historical Society Journal'', Volume 1, 1998.)</ref> 

Marconi's early apparatus was a development of Hertz’s laboratory apparatus into a system designed for communications purposes. At first Marconi used a transmitter to ring a bell in a receiver in his attic laboratory. He then moved his experiments out-of-doors on the family estate near [[Bologna, Italy]], to communicate further. He replaced Hertz’s vertical dipole with a vertical wire topped by a metal sheet, with an opposing terminal connected to the ground. On the receiver side, Marconi replaced the spark gap with a metal powder [[coherer]], a detector developed by [[Edouard Branly]] and other experimenters. Marconi transmitted radio signals for about a mile at the end of 1895.<ref>''Marconi's Three; Transatlantic Radio Stations In [[Cape Breton]]''.</ref>

By 1895, Marconi introduced to the public a device in [[London]], asserting it was his invention. Despite Marconi's statements to the contrary, though, the apparatus resembles Tesla's descriptions in the widely translated articles.<ref> P.J.Papadopoulos, "Nikola Tesla; The Guglielmo Marconi Case, Who is the True Inventor of Radio?" Originally at http://www.mercury.gr/tesla/marcen.html </ref> Marconi's later practical four-tuned system was pre-dated by N. Tesla, [[History of radio#Oliver Lodge|Oliver Lodge]], and J. S. Stone.<ref>Tesla was the first, though, to expound the principles of the four-tuned system. The earlier two-tuned systems were not practical for commercial activity (as found in the United States court case). In addition, other prior work was conducted by others (such as by Hertz and Braun, but not excluding others) from which many of Marconi's devices and methods were derived. Marconi's {{US patent|676332}} ''Apparatus for wireless telegraphy'' [1901], in which a more intricate system was disclosed than in his earlier patents, was filed after contributions made by other investigators.</ref> Marconi’s late-1895 transmission of signals was for around a mile.<ref>This was small when put against Tesla's transmissions below 50 miles.</ref>

Marconi's reputation is largely based on these accomplishments in radio communications and commercializing a practical system. His demonstrations of the use of radio for wireless communications, equipping ships with life saving wireless communications, establishing the first transatlantic radio service, and building the first stations for the British short wave service, have marked his place in history.

Marconi's {{US patent|586193}} ([[July 13]], [[1897]]) (and the reissued {{US patent|RE11913}}) disclosed a two-circuit system for the transmission and reception of "Hertzian waves" (though he would later acknowledge that in the early wireless systems the "''waves do not propagate in the same manner as free radiation from a classical Hertzian oscillator, but glide along the surface of the Earth''"<ref>Marconi, "''[http://nobelprize.org/physics/laureates/1909/marconi-lecture.html Wireless Telegraphic Communication: Nobel Lecture], [[December 11]], [[1909]].''" Nobel Lectures. Physics 1901–1921. Amsterdam: Elsevier Publishing Company, 1967: 196–222.</ref>). The transmitter was an antenna circuit, with an aerial plate and a ground plate, and a spark gap. Induced signals in the circuit were caused to discharge through a spark gap, producing oscillations which were radiated. The receiver contained an antenna circuit, an aerial plate and a ground plate, and a [[coherer]]. Marconi's apparatus was to be resonant (commonly called by various researcheres at the time syntonic). This was done by the careful determination of the size of the aerial plates.

====Transatlantic transmissions====
In 1901, Marconi claimed to have received daytime transatlantic radio frequency signals at a [[medium frequency|wavelength of 366 metres]] (820 kHz).<ref>Henry M. Bradford, "''[http://www.newscotland1398.net/nfld1901/marconi-nfld.html Marconi in Newfoundland: The 1901 Transatlantic Radio Experiment]''".</ref><ref>Henry M.

Accessed 2008-08-09</ref> Critics have claimed that it is more likely that Marconi received [[Signal noise|stray atmospheric noise]] from [[atmospheric electricity]] in this experiment.<ref> "Marconi's Error: The First Transatlantic Wireless Telegraphy in 1901"</ref> The transmitting station in Poldhu, Cornwall used a spark-gap transmitter that could produce a signal just below the medium frequency and with high power levels.<ref>A maximum time-averaged power of 35 kilowatts, but with a peak pulse power of megawatts.</ref> The message received was the morse letter 'S' - three dots. Dr Jack Belrose has recently contested this, however, based on theoretical work as well as a reenactment of the experiment; he believes that Marconi heard only random atmospheric noise and mistook it for the signal. There are various science historians who agree with Jack Belrose that the Atlantic was not bridged in 1901,<ref>In addition to being bolstered by Tesla supporters.</ref> but other science historians have taken the position that this was the first trans-atlantic radio transmission. 

In 1902, Marconi transmitted from his station in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, Canada, across the atlantic and on 18 January 1903 a Marconi station built near Wellfleet, Massachusetts in 1901 sent a message of greetings from Theodore Roosevelt, the President of the United States, to King Edward VII of the United Kingdom, marking the first transatlantic radio transmission originating in the United States. 

Marconi would later found the [[Marconi Company]] and would jointly receive the 1909 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] with [[Karl Ferdinand Braun]].

====20th century patents====
Shortly after the turn of the 20th century, the US Patent Office reawarded Marconi a patent for radio. The {{US patent|RE11913}} was granted on June 4, 1901. Marconi's {{US patent|676332}} was awarded on June 11, 1901, also. This system was more advanced than his previous works.

===Radio patent decision===

In 1943 a lawsuit regarding Marconi's US radio patents was resolved by the [[United States Supreme Court]], who overturned most of these. The Marconi Company brought this suit in the Court of Claims to recover damages for infringement of four United States patents. Two, {{US patent|763772}} and {{US patent|RE11913}}, were issued to Marconi, a third, {{US patent|609154}}, to Lodge, and a fourth, {{US patent|803684}}, to Fleming. The court held that the Marconi reissue patent was not infringed. In its consideration of [[radio communication system]]s, the United States courts accepted a "definition evolved out of the exhaustive depositions taken from many technical experts..."<ref name=time>{{cite book | title = Tesla: Man Out of Time | author = Margaret Cheney | year = 2001 | publisher = Simon and Schuster | isbn = 0743215362 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=8b-Dp_2KmJoC&source=gbs_summary_s&cad=0}}</ref>  as requiring "two [[tuned circuits]] each at the [[transmitter]] and [[receiver]], all four tuned to the same [[frequency]]."<ref name=time/><ref>320 U.S. 1. Marconi Wireless Telegraph co. of America v. United States</ref><ref>Cheney, M., Uth, R., & Glenn, J. (1999). [http://books.google.com/books?id=3W6_h6XG6VAC&pg=PA70&ei=0YGsSPrEMJDwsgP4xZDxBA&sig=ACfU3U2xsnuskKLOTEFas0mT1apmmW24AQ Tesla, Master of Lightning]. New York: Barnes & Noble Books. Page 71.</ref>

The court found Marconi showed no invention over Stone ({{US patent|714756}}) by making the tuning of his antenna circuit adjustable, or by using Lodge's variable inductance for that purpose. The court decision was based on the proven prior work conducted by others, such as by [[Nikola Tesla]], [[Oliver Lodge]], and [[John Stone Stone]], from which some of Marconi patents stemmed. At the time, the [[United States Army]] was involved in a patent infringement lawsuit with Marconi's company regarding radio, leading various observers to posit that the government nullified Marconi's other patents in order to moot any claims for compensation (as, it is speculated, the government's initial reversal to grant Marconi the patent right in order to nullify any claims Tesla had for compensation).

The U. S. Supreme Court stated that, 
: "''The Tesla patent No. 645,576, applied for September 2, 1897 and allowed March 20, 1900, disclosed a four-circuit system, having two circuits each at transmitter and receiver, and recommended that all four circuits be tuned to the same frequency. ''[... He]'' recognized that his apparatus could, without change, be used for wireless communication, which is dependent upon the transmission of electrical energy.''"<ref>U.S. Supreme Court, "''[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=320&invol=1 Marconi Wireless Telegraph co. of America v. United States]''". 320 U.S. 1. Nos. 369, 373. Argued April 9-12, 1943. Decided [[June 21]], [[1943]].</ref> 
In making their decision, the court noted, 
: "''Marconi's reputation as the man who first achieved successful radio transmission rests on his original patent, which became reissue No. 11,913, and which is not here [320 U.S. 1, 38] in question. That reputation, however well-deserved, does not entitle him to a patent for every later improvement which he claims in the radio field. Patent cases, like others, must be decided not by weighing the reputations of the litigations, but by careful study of the merits of their respective contentions and proofs''."<ref>''Wireless Telegraph co. of America v. United States''.</ref> 
The court also stated that, 
: "''It is well established that as between two inventors priority of invention will be awarded to the one who by satisfying proof can show that he first conceived of the invention''."<ref>''Wireless Telegraph co. of America v. United States''.</ref>

[[Image:Tesla The Great Radio.jpg|thumb|right|The album, [[The Great Radio Controversy]], is titled after the controversy about the identity of the inventor of radio. It is posed that Serbian engineer Nikola Tesla (whom the band is named after) is the true inventor of radio, while the Italian Guglielmo Marconi took the credit and is widely regarded as having the title. The album's inner sleeve recounts this story.]]
