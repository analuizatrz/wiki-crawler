{{For|information on the income of individuals|Personal income in the United States}}
The '''Household income in the United States''' is a measure of current private income commonly used by the [[United States]] government and private institutions. To measure the income of a household, the pre-tax money receipts of all residents over the age of 15 are combined. Most of these receipts are in the form of wages and salaries (before withholding and other taxes), but many other forms of income, such as unemployment insurance, disability, child support, etc., are included as well.  The residents of the household do not have to be related to the householder for their earnings to be considered part of the household's income.<ref name="Definition of household income">{{cite web|url=http://www.sccommunityprofiles.org/glossary.asp|title=Definition of household income|accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref> While the use of household income remains among the most widely accepted as households tend to share a common economic fate, the size of a household which is commonly not considered may off-set gains in household income.<ref name="The American Class Structure">{{cite book | last = Gilbert | first = Dennis | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1998 | title = The American Class Structure | publisher = Wadsworth Publishing | location = New York | id = 0-534-50520-1}}</ref>

The 2006 economic survey also found that households in the top two [[income quintiles]], those with an annual household income exceeding $60,000, had a [[median]] of two income earners while those in the lower quintiles (2nd and middle quintile) had median of only one income earner per household.

In 1990, the median household income was determined to be $30,056; $44,603 in 2003 dollars. While personal income has remained relatively stagnant over the past few decades, household income has risen due to the rising percentage of households with two or more income earners.

===Quintiles===

Households are often divided into quintiles according to their gross income.  Each quintile represents 20%, or one fifth, of all households.  

Household type is strongly correlated with household income.  Married couples are disproportionately represented in the upper two quintiles, compared to the general population of households.  Cross-referencing shows that this is likely due to the presence of multiple income earners in these families. Non-family households (individuals) are disproportionately represented in the lower two quintiles.  Households headed by single males are disproportionately found in the middle three quintles; single females head households concentrated in the bottom three quintiles.

The highest income households are almost ten times as likely to own their homes rather than rent, but in the lowest quintile, the ratio of owners to renters is nearly one to one.

The [[New York Times]] has used the quintiles to define [[social class in the United States|class]].  It has assigned the quintiles from lowest to highest as [[lower class]], [[lower middle class]], [[middle class]], [[upper middle class]], and [[upper class]].<ref name="New York Times definition of class according to the quintiles">{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/national/20050515_CLASS_GRAPHIC/index_01.html|title=New York Times definition of class according to the quintiles|accessdate=2006-07-08}}</ref>

Considering how education significantly enhances the earnings potential of individuals, it should come as no surprise that individuals with [[graduate degree]]s have an average [[per capita income]] exceeding the [[median household income]] of [[Census family|married couple families]] among the general population ($63,813).<ref name="US Census Bureau on Education and Income">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/prod/2002pubs/p23-210.pdf|title=US Census Bureau on Education and Income|accessdate=2006-06-30}}</ref><ref name="Infoplease, median household income">{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0104688.html|title=Infoplease, median household income|accessdate=2006-06-29}}</ref>  Higher [[Educational attainment in the United States|educational attainment]] did not, however, help close the income gap between the genders as the life-time earnings for a male with a professional degree were roughly forty percent (39.59%) higher than those of a female with a [[Educational attainment in the United States|professionals degree]].  The life-time earnings gap between males and females was the smallest for those individuals holding an [[Educational attainment in the United States|Associate degrees]] with male life-time earnings being 27.77% higher than those of females. While [[educational attainment]] did not help reduce the [[income inequality]] between men and women, it did increase the earnings potential of individuals of both sexes, greatly enabling many households with (a) [[Educational attainment in the United States|graduate degree]] householder(s) to enter the top household income quintile.<ref name="US Census Bureau on Education and Income">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/prod/2002pubs/p23-210.pdf|title=US Census Bureau on Education and Income|accessdate=2006-06-30}}</ref>

Household income also increased significantly with the [[Educational attainment in the United States|educational attainment]] of the householder. The [[US Census Bureau]] publishes [[Educational attainment in the United States|educational attainment]] and income data for all households with a householder who was aged twenty-five or older. The biggest income difference was between those with some college education and those who had a [[Bachelor's degree]], with the latter making $23,874 more. Income also increased substantially with increased post-secondary education. While the median household income for a household with a household holding an Associates degree was $51,970, the median household income for those with a Bachelor's degree or higher was $73,446. Those with [[Doctorate degree|doctorates]] had the second highest median household with a median of $96,830; $18,289 more higher than that for those at the [[Master's degree]] level, but $3,170 lower than the median for households with a professionals degree holding householder.<ref name="Educational attainment and median household income">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/hhes/income/histinc/h13.html|title=Educational attainment and median household income|accessdate=2006-09-24}}</ref>

===Age of householder===
Household income in the [[United States]] varies substantially with the age of the person who heads the household. Overall the median household income increased with the age of householder until [[retirement age]] when household income started to decline.<ref name="US Census Bureau median household income by age of householder">{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032005/hhinc/new02_001.htm|title=US Census Bureau median household income by age of householder|accessdate=2006-07-07}}</ref> The highest median household income was found among households headed by working [[baby-boomers]].<ref name="US Census Bureau median household income by age of householder">{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032005/hhinc/new02_001.htm|title=US Census Bureau median household income by age of householder|accessdate=2006-07-07}}</ref> Households headed by persons between the ages of 45 and 54 had a median household income of $61,111 and a mean household income of $77,634. The [[median income per member of household]] for this particular group was $27,924. The highest median income per member of household was among those between the ages of 54 and 64 with $30,544. The group with the second highest median household income, were households headed by persons between the ages 35 and 44 with a median income of $56,785, followed by those in the age group between 55 and 64 with $50,400. Not surprisingly the lowest income group was compromised of those household headed by individuals younger than 24, followed by those headed by persons over the age of 75. Overall households headed by persons above the age of seventy-five had a median household income of $20,467 with the median household income per member of household being $18,645. These figures support the general assumption that median household income as well as the [[median income per member of household]] peaked among those households headed by middle aged persons, increasing with the age of the householder and the size of the household until the householder reaches the age of 64. With retirement income replacing salaries and the size of the household declining, the median household income decreases as well.<ref name="US Census Bureau median household income by age of householder">{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032005/hhinc/new02_001.htm|title=US Census Bureau median household income by age of householder|accessdate=2006-07-07}}</ref>

===Aggregate income distribution===
The aggregate income measures the combined income earned by all persons in a particular income group. Overall all households in the [[United States]] earned roughly $4,286,391 million in 2005 (4.3 trillion). Roughly one third, 32.5%, of all income in the US was earned by those households with an income over $150,000, approximately the top five percent. Approximately one fifth, 20.58%, of all income was earned by the top 2.67%, those households earning more than $200,000 a year. Overall the [[aggregate income]] distributing tilts toward the top, despite the fact that households with middle-range annual incomes ranging from $50,000 to $75,000 earned roughly one fourth, 25.11% of all income. As the percentage of middle-range income households is roughly one-fourth of the population, this particular income group's share of income is roughly equal to their representation in the general population. The bottom 6.37%, however only earned 0.27% of all income.<ref name="US Census 2006 Economic Survey, income data">{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032005/hhinc/new06_000.htm|title=US Census 2006 Economic Survey, income data|accessdate=2006-06-29}}</ref>

Since 1967, the median household income in the [[United States]] has risen by 31%, fluctuating several times. The rise in household income is largely the result of an increase in personal income among college graduates, a group that has doubled in size since the 1960s, and women entering the labor force. Today, 42% of all households have two income earners. Household income increased dramatically faster for affluent households with income inequality having increased steadily since the 1970s.<ref name="US Census Bureau. (2001).

While household income has increased, its growth has been slowed by a decrease in married-couple households who tend to have two earners and, therefore, higher incomes. While the proportion of wives working year-round in married couple households with children has increased from 17% in 1967 to 39% in 1996, the proportion of such households among the general population has decreased. This means that that the share the most economically prosperous type of household in the has been dwindling in the [[United States]]. In 1969, more than 40% of all households consisted of a married couple with children. By 1996 only a rough quarter of US households consisted of married couples with children. As a result of these changing [[Demographics of the United States|household demographics]], median household income rose relatively slow despite an ever increasing female labor force and a considerable increase in the percentage of [[Educational attainment in the United States|college graduates]].<ref name="Income from 1969 to 1996, US Census Bureau">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/prod/3/98pubs/p23-196.pdf|title=Income from 1969 to 1996, US Census Bureau|accessdate=2006-09-26}}</ref>

{{cquote|
"From 1969 to 1996, median household income rose a very modest 6.3 percent in constant dollars... The 1969 to 1996 stagnation in median household income may, in fact, be largely a reflection of changes in the size and composition of households rather than a reflection of a stagnating economy."- John McNeil, US Census Bureau

Overall, the median household income rose from $33,338 in 1967 to an all-time high of $44,922 in 1999, and has since decreased slightly to $43,318. Decreases in household income are visible during each [[recession]], while increases are visible during economic upturns. These fluctuations were felt across the income strata as the incomes of both, the 95th and 20th percentile were affected by fluctuations in the economy. Income in the period between 1967 and 1999 grew considerably faster among wealthier households than it did among poorer households. For example the household income for the 80th precentile, the lower threshold for the [[Income quintiles|top quintile]], rose from $55,265 in 1967 to $86,867 in 2003, a 57.2% increase. The median household income rose by 30% while the income for the 20th percentile (the lower threshold for the second lowest [[Income quintiles|quitile]]) rose by only 28% from $14,002 to $17,984. As the majority of households in the [[Income quintiles|top quintile]] had two income earners, versus zero for the lowest quintile and that the widening gap between the top and lowest quintile may largely be the reflection of changing household demographics including the addition of women to the workforce.<ref name="Income and poverty since 1967, US Census Bureau">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/p60-226.pdf|title=Income and poverty since 1967, US Census Bureau|accessdate=2006-09-26}}</ref><ref name="Income from 1969 to 1996, US Census Bureau">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/prod/3/98pubs/p23-196.pdf|title=Income from 1969 to 1996, US Census Bureau|accessdate=2006-09-26}}</ref> Household demographics are not, however, the cause of the growing gap between the top 5% and the rest of the upper quintile. The top 5% had fewer dual earner households and full-time workers than the top quintile overall. In 2003 a household in the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile earned 77.2% more than a household in the 80<sup>th</sup> percentile, compared to 60.5% in 1967, a 27.6% increase in the earnings increase discrepancy between the two groups. Overall the income of the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile grew 15.2% faster than that of the 80<sup>th</sup>, 146.8% faster than that of the median and 159.9% faster than that of the 20<sup>th</sup> percentile.<ref name="DeNavas, C., Proctor, B.

While per-capita, disposable income has increased 469% since 1972, it has only increased moderately when inflation is considered. In 1972, disposable personal income was determined to be $4,129; $19,385 in 2005 dollars.

==Social class==
{{main|Social class in the United States}}
Household income is one of the most commonly used measures of [[Income in the United States|income]] and, therefore, also one of the most prominent indicators of [[Social class in the United States|social class]]. Household income does not, however, always reflect class status or [[standard of living]] correctly. It does not consider household size and, due to differing numbers of income earners per household, does not always accurately reflect a person's position within the occupational hierarchy. [[Sociology|Sociologist]] [[Dennis Gilbert]] acknowledges that "... the class structure... does not exactly match the distribution of household income" with "the mismatch [being] greatest in the middle..." (Gilbert, 1998: 92) He states that it is possible for a dual earner household from the [[American middle class#Working class majority|working class]] to earn as much as a single [[American middle class#The Professional/Managerial middle class|upper middle class]] individual. Yet, he contends that household income is the best suited income measure as all members of a household share a more or less common socio-economic vantage point. As social classes lack distinct boundaries and commonly overlap, it is not possible to define any household income thresholds. Rather, only common income ranges and typical household incomes are available. According to Leonard Beeghley a household income of roughly $95,000 would be typical of a dual-earner middle class household while $60,000 would be typical of a dual-earner working class household and $18,000 typical for an [[Poverty in the United States|impoverished]] household. William Thompson and Joseph Hickey see common incomes for the upper class as those exceeding $500,000 with upper middle class incomes ranging from the high 5-figures to most commonly in excess of $100,000. Typical household incomes for the lower middle class range from $35,000 to $75,000; $16,000 to $30,000 for the working class and less than $16,000 for the [[American lower class|lower class]].

Of the top fifteen states, all were located in the Northeast and West, with the exception of [[Minnesota]] which ranked fifth and [[Wisconsin]] (15th). 

The [[Southern United States|southern states]] had, by far, the lowest median household income, with nine out of the country's fifteen poorest states being located in the South. It should be noted, however, that most of the poverty in the South is located in rural areas. Metropolitan areas such as Atlanta, Nashville, Raleigh-Durham, Birmingham, Dallas, Houston, Miami, to name just a few, are areas within the southern states that have above average income levels. Overall, median household income tended to be the highest in nation's most urbanized northeastern, upper midwestern and west coast states, while rural areas mostly in the southern, and mountain states had the lowest median household income.<ref name="US Census Bureau, median household income by state 2004">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/income04/statemhi.html|title=US Census Bureau, median household income by state 2004|accessdate=2006-07-01}}</ref>

==Median income==
The [[median]] income divides households in the US evenly in the middle with half of all household earning more than the median income and half of all households earning less than the median household income. In 2004 the median household income in the [[United States]] was $43,389.<ref name="Infoplease, median household income">{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0104688.html|title=Infoplease, median household income|accessdate=2006-06-29}}</ref> According to the [[US Census Bureau]], the median is "considerably lower than the average, and provides a more accurate representation."<ref name="US Census Bureau on the nature the median in determining wealth">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/p70-88.pdf|title=US Census Bureau on the nature the median in determining wealth|accessdate=2006-06-29}}</ref> Considering other racial and geographical differences in regards to household income, it should come as no surprise that the [[median]] household income varies with [[race]], size of household and [[geography]]. The [[US state|state]] with the highest median household income in the United States as of the US Census Bureau 2005/06 is [[New jersey]] with $66,752, followed by [[Maryland]], [[Hawaii]] and [[Connecticut]], making the [[Northeastern United States]] the wealthiest area by income in the entire country.<ref name="US Census Bureau, median household income by state">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/income04/statemhi.html|title=US Census Bureau, median household income by state|accessdate=2006-06-29}}</ref> In terms of region the median household income was as follows: "[[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] ($47,994), [[Western United States|West]] ($47,680) and [[Southern United States|South]] ($40,773)." Median household income in the [[Midwestern United States|Mid-West]] declined by 2.8% to $44,657.<ref name="US Census Bureau, median household income according to certain demographic characteristics">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/income_wealth/005647.html|title=US Census Bureau, median household income according to certain demographic characteristics|accessdate=2006-06-29}}</ref> While median household income has a tendency to increase up to four persons per household, it declines thereon after. This indicated that while four person households have larger incomes than those with one, two or three members, households seem to earn progressively less as their size increases beyond four persons. According to the US Census Bureau 2004 Community Survey, two-person households had a median income of $39,755, with $48,957 for three-person households, $54,338 for four-person households, $50,905 for five-person households, $45,435 for six-person households, with seven-or-more-person households having the second lowest median income of only $42,471.<ref name="US Census Bureau, median family income by family size">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/medincsizeandstate.html|title=US Census Bureau, median family income by family size|accessdate=2006-06-29}}</ref>. In terms of race, [[Asian-Americans]] households had the highest median household income of $57,518, [[European-American]] households ranked second with $48,977, [[Hispanic|Hispanic or Latino]] households ranked third with $34,241. [[African-American|African American or Black]] households had the lowest median household income of all races with $30,134.<ref name="US Census Bureau, median household income according to certain demographic characteristics">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/income_wealth/005647.html|title=US Census Bureau, median household income according to certain demographic characteristics|accessdate=2006-06-29}}</ref>

==Mean income==<!-- This section is linked from [[Social class]] -->
Another common measurement of personal income is the mean household income. Unlike the median household income which divides all households in two halves, the mean income is the average income earned by [[United States|American]] households. In the case of mean income, the income of all households is divided by the number of all households.<ref name="US Government, the different between mean and median">{{cite web|url=http://www.business.gov/topics/research_resources/market_research/census_bureau_faq.html|title=US Government, the different between mean and median|accessdate=2006-06-29}}</ref> The mean income is usually more affected by the relatively unequal distribution of income which tilts towards the top.<ref name="US Census Bureau on the nature the median in determining wealth">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/p70-88.pdf|title=US Census Bureau on the nature the median in determining wealth|accessdate=2006-06-29}}</ref> As a result the mean tends to be higher than the median income with the top earning households boosting it. Overall the mean household income in the United States according to the [[US Census Bureau]] 2004 Economic Survey was $60,528, or $17,210 (39.73%) higher than the median household income.<ref name="US Census Bureau, mean household income">{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032005/hhinc/new06_000.htm|title=US Census Bureau, mean household income|accessdate=2006-06-29}}</ref>

{{cquote|
"[[Median]] income is the amount which divides the [[income distribution]] into two equal groups, half having income above that amount, and half having income below that amount. [[Mean]] income ([[average]]) is the amount obtained by dividing the total aggregate income of a group by the number of units in that group.

The mean household income for households headed by persons identifying as [[White (people)|White alone]] was $65,317, $40,685 for those headed by persons identifying as [[African American|African American or Black]], $45,871 for those headed by persons identifying as [[Hispanic|Hispanic or Latino]], and $76,747 for those households headed by persons identifying as [[Asian-Americans|Asian alone]]. Approximately one third, or 36.5%, of all households earned more than the mean income, while 63.5% earned less than the mean.<ref name="US Census Bureau, mean household income">{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032005/hhinc/new06_000.htm|title=US Census Bureau, mean household income|accessdate=2006-06-29}}</ref>
