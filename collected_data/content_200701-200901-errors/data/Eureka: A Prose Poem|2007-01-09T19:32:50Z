'''''Eureka''''' (1848) is a prose poem by [[Edgar Allan Poe]] in which he describes his intuitive conception of the universe. It is dedicated to the German naturalist and explorer [[Alexander von Humboldt]].

*''Eureka'' presents a physical/spiritual system for which many of Poe's tales and poems serve as allegories. It was  his last major work and grew out of a two and a half hour lecture entitled "The Universe," delivered on [[February 3]], [[1848]]. Poe wrote the 150-page essay based on the lecture by May of that year. 

*The publication of ''Eureka'' brought Poe a vehement anonymous censure, in the ''Literary Review''. This was believed by Poe to have been written  by John Henry Hopkins, Jr., a young theological student, who had previously criticised the work as [[pantheistic]] and "a damnable heresy" that "conscience would compel him to denounce..." (Silverman) 

*In ''Eureka'', Poe [[Wiktionary:presage|presage]]s modern science with his own concept of the [[Big Bang]]. He postulated that the universe began from a single originating particle or [[gravitational singularity|singularity]]. This particle divides into all the particles of the universe. These particles seek one another because of their originating unity (gravity) resulting in the end of the universe as a single particle.
