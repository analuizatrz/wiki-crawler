{{Politics of the United States}}
The '''Democratic Party''' is one of two [[major party|major]] [[political parties in the United States]], the other being the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. It is the oldest political party in continuous operation in the United States and among the oldest in the world.<!--please see long discussions on Talk before altering this--><ref>{{cite book

The Democratic Party traces its origins to the [[Democratic-Republican Party]], founded by [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Madison]], and other influential opponents of the [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist]]s in 1792. Since the division of the Republican Party in the election of [[United States presidential election, 1912|1912]], it has consistently positioned itself to the [[Left-wing politics|left]] of the Republican Party in economic as well as social matters. The economically activist philosophy of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], which has strongly influenced [[Liberalism in the United States|American liberalism]], has shaped much of the party's economic agenda since [[United States presidential election, 1932|1932]]. Roosevelt's [[New Deal coalition]] usually controlled the national government until the 1970s. The [[civil rights movement]] of the 1960s has continued to inspire the party's liberal principles,<ref name="Economist Intelligence Unit. (July 11, 2007). Political Forces"/> despite having lost the more conservative South in the process.

In 2004, it was the largest political party, with 72 million voters (42.6% of 169 million registered) claiming affiliation.<ref name="Neuhart, P. (22 January, 2004). Why politics is fun from catbirds' seats. ''USA Today'''.">{{cite web

''USA Today'''. |accessdate=2007-07-11}}</ref> Since the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 midterm elections]], the Democratic Party is the [[Two-party system|majority party]] for the [[110th United States Congress|110th]] [[United States Congress|Congress]]; the party holds an outright majority in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[Democratic Caucus of the United States Senate|Democratic caucus]] (including two [[independent (politician)|independent]]s) constitutes a majority in the [[United States Senate]]. Democrats also hold a majority of [[List of current United States governors|state governorships]] and control a [[plurality]] of [[List of U.S. state legislatures|state legislatures]]. The party's nominee for [[President of the United States]] in the upcoming [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 election]] is Senator [[Barack Obama]] of [[Illinois]] and the nominee for [[Vice President of the United States]] is Senator [[Joe Biden]] of Delaware.

==Current structure and composition==
[[Image:U.S. party affiliation.svg|thumb|left|Registered Democrats, Republicans and Independents in 2004 in millions.<ref name="Neuhart, P. (22 January, 2004). Why politics is fun from catbirds' seats. ''USA Today'''."/>]]

The [[Democratic National Committee]] (DNC) is responsible for promoting Democratic campaign activities. While the DNC is responsible for overseeing the process of writing the Democratic Platform, the DNC is more focused on campaign and organizational strategy than public policy. In presidential elections it supervises the [[Democratic National Convention]]. The national convention is subject to the charter of the party, the ultimate authority within the Democratic Party when it is in session, with the DNC running the party's organization at other times. The DNC is currently chaired by former Vermont Governor [[Howard Dean]].

The [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]] (DCCC) assists party candidates in House races; its current chairman (selected by the party caucus) is Rep. [[Chris Van Hollen]] of Maryland. Similarly the [[Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee]] (DSCC) raises large sums for Senate races. It is currently headed by Senator [[Chuck Schumer]] of New York. The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC), currently chaired by Mike Gronstal of Iowa, is a smaller organization with much less funding that focuses on state legislative races. The DNC sponsors the [[College Democrats of America]] (CDA), a student-outreach organization with the goal of training and engaging a new generation of Democratic activists. [[Democrats Abroad]] is the organization for Americans living outside the United States; they work to advance the goals of the party and encourage Americans living abroad to support the Democrats. The [[Young Democrats of America]] (YDA) is a youth-led organization that attempts to draw in and mobilize young people for Democratic candidates, but operates outside of the DNC. In addition, the recently created branch of the Young Democrats, the Young Democrats High School Caucus, attempts to raise awareness and activism amongst teenagers to not only vote and volunteer, but participate in the future as well.The [[Democratic Governors Association]] (DGA) is an organization supporting the candidacies of Democratic gubernatorial nominees and incumbents; it is currently chaired by Governor [[Joe Manchin]] of West Virginia. Similarly the mayors of the largest cities and urban centres convene as the [[National Conference of Democratic Mayors]].

Each state also has a state committee, made up of elected committee members as well as ex-officio committee members (usually elected officials and representatives of major constituencies), which in turn elects a chair. County, town, city and ward committees generally are composed of individuals elected at the local level. State and local committees often coordinate campaign activities within their jurisdiction, oversee local conventions and in some cases primaries or caucuses, and may have a role in nominating candidates for elected office under state law. Rarely do they have much funding, but in 2005 DNC Chairman Dean began a program (called the "50 State Strategy") of using DNC national funds to assist all state parties and paying for full time professional staffers.<ref>{{cite news | last = Gilgoff | first = Dan | title = Dean's List | date = [[2006-07-16]] | url = http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/060716/24dems.htm | publisher = [[U.S. News & World Report]] | accessdate = 2007-04-26}}</ref>

[[Image:Democratic Base.svg|thumb|left|200px|Composition of the Democratic base according to a 2005 Pew Research Center study.]]

Since the 1890s, the Democratic Party has favored "[[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]]" positions (the term "liberal" in this sense describes [[social liberalism]], not [[classical liberalism]]). In recent exit polls, the Democratic Party has had broad appeal across all socio-ethno-economic demographics.<ref name="CNN. (2000). Exit Poll.">{{cite web

In 2004, roughly 72 million (42.6 percent) Americans were registered Democrats, compared to 55 million (32.5 percent) Republicans and 42 million (24.8 percent) independents.<ref name="Neuhart, P. (22 January, 2004). Why politics is fun from catbirds' seats. ''USA Today'''."/>

Historically, the party has favored farmers, laborers, labor unions, and religious and ethnic minorities; it has opposed unregulated business and finance, and favored progressive income taxes. In foreign policy, internationalism (including interventionism) was a dominant theme from 1913 to the mid 1960s. In the 1930s, the party began advocating welfare spending programs targeted at the poor. The party had a pro-business wing, typified by [[Al Smith]], that shrank in the 1930s, and a [[Southern Democrats|Southern]] conservative wing that shrank after President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] supported the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. The major influences for liberalism were labor unions (which peaked in the 1936-1952 era), and the [[African American]] wing, which has steadily grown since the 1960s. Since the 1970s, [[environmentalism]] has been a major new component.

In recent decades, the party has adopted a [[Centrism|centrist]] economic and more [[Social progressivism|socially progressive]] agenda, with the voter base having shifted considerably. Once dominated by unionized labor and the [[working class]], the Democratic base now consists of [[social liberalism|social liberals]] who tend to be well-educated as well as the socially more conservative working class. Today, Democrats advocate more social freedoms, [[affirmative action]], [[balanced budget]], and a [[Capitalism|free enterprise]] system tempered by [[public sector|government intervention]] ([[mixed economy]]). The economic policy adopted by the modern Democratic Party, including the former [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]], may also be referred to as the "[[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]]".<ref>{{cite web

The Democratic Party, once dominant in the [[Southeastern United States]], is now strongest in the Northeast ([[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]] and [[New England]]), [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes region]], and the [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific Coast]] (including [[Hawaii]]). The Democrats are also strongest in [[List of United States cities by population|major cities]].

===Ideologies===
{{See|Political ideologies in the United States}}
With over 72 million registered members, the Democratic Party is home to an ideologically diverse base. Liberals form by far the largest and most influential ideological demographic within the party.

====Liberals====
{{main|Modern liberalism in the United States|Liberalism in the United States|Progressivism in the United States}}
[[Image:Liberal opinions.png|thumb|left|350px|Opinions of liberals in a 2005 Pew Research Center study.]]

[[Social liberalism|Social liberals]], also referred to as progressives or modern liberals, constitute a large part, about 45.6 percent, of the Democratic voter base. Liberals thereby form the largest united typological demographic within the Democratic base. According to the Pew Research Center liberals constitute roughly 19 percent of the electorate with 92 percent of American liberals favoring the Democratic Party.<ref name="Pew Research Center."/> While college-educated professionals were mostly Republican until the 1950s, they now comprise perhaps the most vital component of the Democratic Party.<ref name="Judis, B.

Immigration and cultural diversity is deemed positive; liberals favor [[cultural pluralism]], a system in which immigrants retain their native culture in addition to adopting their new culture. They tend to be divided on free trade agreements and organizations such as the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA). Most liberals oppose increased military standing and the display of the [[Ten Commandments]] in public buildings.<ref name="Pew Research Center."/>

This ideological group differs from the traditional organized labor base. According to the [[Pew Research Center]], a plurality of 41 percent resided in [[mass affluent]] households and 49 percent were college graduates, the highest figure of any typographical group. It was also the fastest growing typological group between the late 1990s and early 2000s.<ref name="Pew Research Center."/> Liberals include most of academia<ref name="Kurtz, H. (29 March, 2005).

Many [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] Democrats are descendants of the [[New Left]] of Democratic presidential candidate Senator [[George McGovern]] of South Dakota; others were involved in the presidential candidacies of [[Vermont]] Governor [[Howard Dean]] and U.S. Representative [[Dennis Kucinich]] of [[Ohio]]; still others are disaffected former members of the [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]]. The [[Congressional Progressive Caucus]] (CPC) is a caucus of progressive Democrats, and is the single largest Democratic caucus in the House of Representatives. Its members have included [[Dennis Kucinich]] of Ohio, [[John Conyers]] of Michigan, [[Jim McDermott]] of Washington, [[John Lewis (politician)|John Lewis]] of Georgia, [[Barbara Lee]] of California, the late Senator [[Paul Wellstone]] of Minnesota, and [[Sherrod Brown]] of Ohio, now a Senator.

====Civil libertarians====
[[Civil libertarianism|Civil libertarians]] also often support the Democratic Party because Democratic positions on such issues as [[civil rights]] and [[separation of church and state]] are more closely aligned to their own than the positions of the Republican Party, and because the Democratic economic agenda may be more appealing to them than that of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]]. They oppose gun control, the "[[Prohibition (drugs)|War on Drugs]]," [[protectionism]], [[corporate welfare]], government debt, and an [[interventionism (politics)|interventionist]] foreign policy. The Democratic Freedom Caucus is an organized group of this faction.

====Conservatives====
The [[Pew Research Center]] has stated that [[conservative Democrat]]s represent 15% of [[voter registration|registered voters]] and 14% of the general electorate.<ref name="Pew Research Center."/> In the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], the [[Blue Dog Coalition]], a caucus of fiscal and social conservatives and moderates, primarily southerners, forms part of the Democratic Party's current faction of [[conservative Democrat]]s. They have acted as a unified voting bloc in the past, giving its forty plus members some ability to change legislation and broker compromises with the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]'s leadership. [[Pro-life]] Democrats are sometimes classified as conservatives on the basis of [[social conservatism]].

====Centrists====
Though [[centrism|centrist]] Democrats differ on a variety of issues, they typically foster a mix of political views and ideas. Compared to other Democratic factions, they are tend to be more supportive of the use of military force, including the war in Iraq, and are more willing to reduce government welfare, as indicated by their support for [[welfare reform]] and [[tax cut]]s. One of the most influential factions is the [[Democratic Leadership Council]] (DLC), a nonprofit organization that advocates [[centrism|centrist]] positions for the party. The DLC hails President [[Bill Clinton]] as proof of the viability of "[[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]]" politicians and a DLC success story. Former Representative [[Harold Ford, Jr.]] of [[Tennessee]] is its current chairman.

===Professionals===
Professionals, those who have a college education and whose work revolves around the conceptualization of ideas, have supported the Democratic Party by a slight majority since 2000. Between 1988 and 2000, professionals favored Democrats by a 12 percentage point margin. While the professional class was once a stronghold of the Republican Party it has become increasingly split between the two parties, leaning in favor of the Democratic Party. The increasing support for Democratic candidates among professionals may be traced to the prevalence of social liberal values among this group.<ref name="Judis & Teixeira">{{web cite

====Academia====
Academics, intellectuals and the highly [[Educational attainment|educated]] overall constitute an important part of the Democratic voter base. [[Academia]] in particular tends to be [[Modern liberalism in the United States|progressive]]. In a 2005 survey, nearly 72% of full-time faculty members identified as liberal, while 15% identified as conservative. The [[social sciences]] and [[humanities]] were the most liberal disciplines while business was the most [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]].

As of July, 2008 the "[[Students for Academic Freedom]]" a national coalition of (mostly conservative) student organizations, posted a list of 440 student complaints, most of which pertain to perceived liberal bias of college professors ([http://www.studentsforacademicfreedom.org/abuse-center/ Abuse Center]).

===Youth===
Studies have shown that younger voters tend to vote mostly for Democratic candidates in recent years. Despite supporting [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H. W. Bush]], the young have voted in favor of the Democratic presidential candidate in every election since [[Bill Clinton]] in 1992, and are more likely to identify as liberals than the general population.<ref name="Nagourney">{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/27/washington/27poll.html?_r=3&hp=&adxnnl=1&oref=slogin&adxnnlx=1182947253-8kvQkT+aYTOYz/BCpTsRCg&oref=slogin&oref=slogin|title=Nagourney, A.

In the 2006 midterm elections, the Democrats received 60% of the vote from the same age group, while the Republicans only received 38%.<ref name="CNN. (2004). Exit Poll."/><ref name="CNN. (2006). Exit Poll."/> Polls suggest that younger voters tend to be more liberal than the general population, and have more liberal views than the general public on same-sex marriage and universal healthcare, with 58% planning to vote Democratic in 2008.<ref name="Nagourney"/>

===Labor===
Since the 1930s, a critical component of the Democratic Party coalition has been [[Labor unions in the United States|organized labor]]. Labor unions supply a great deal of the money, grass roots political organization, and voting base of support for the party. Democrats are far more likely to be represented by unions, although union membership has declined, in general, during the last few decades. This trend is depicted in the following graph from the book, ''Democrats and Republicans - Rhetoric and Reality.''<ref>Fried, Joseph, ''Democrats and Republicans - Rhetoric and Reality'' (New York: Algora Publishing, 2008), 126.</ref> It is based on surveys conducted by the National Election Studies (NES).

[[Image:Fig 109 - does someone in house belong to union.JPG|thumb|350px|left]]

The historic decline in union membership over the past half century has been accompanied by a growing disparity between public sector and private sector union membership percentages. The three most significant labor groupings in the Democratic coalition today are the [[AFL-CIO]] and [[Change to Win Federation|Change to Win]] [[National trade union center|labor federations]], as well as the [[National Education Association]], a large, unaffiliated [[teacher|teachers']] union. Both the AFL-CIO and Change to Win have identified their top legislative priority for 2007 as passage of the [[Employee Free Choice Act]]. Other important issues for labor unions include supporting [[industrial policy]] (including [[protectionism]]) that sustains unionized [[manufacturing]] jobs, raising the [[minimum wage]] and promoting broad social programs such as [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[universal health care]].

====Working class====

}}</ref> Yet, as those with lower [[Social class in the United States|socioeconomic status]] are less likely to vote, the working and lower classes are underrepresented in the electorate. The working class is largely distinguished by highly routinized and closely supervised work. It consists mainly of [[Clerk#United States|clerical]] and [[blue-collar worker]]s.<ref name="The American Class Structure"/> Even though most in the working class are able afford an adequate standard of living, high economic insecurity and possible personal benefit from an extended social safety net, make the majority of working class person left-of-center on economic issues. Most working class Democrats differ from most liberals, however, in their more socially conservative views. Working class Democrats tend to be more religious and likely to belong to an ethnic minority. Socially conservative and disadvantaged Democrats are among the least educated and lowest earning ideological demographics. In 2005, only 15% had a college degree, compared to 27% at the national average and 49% of liberals, respectively. Together socially conservative and the financially disadvantaged comprised roughly 54% of the Democratic base.<ref name="Pew Research Center."/> The continued importance of the working class votes manifests itself in recent CNN exit polls, which shows that the majority of those with low [[Income in the United States|incomes]] and little education vote for the Democratic Party.<ref name="CNN. (2000). Exit Poll."/><ref name="CNN. (2004). Exit Poll."/><ref name="CNN. (2006). Exit Poll."/>

===Ethnic minorities===
A large portion of the Democratic voting base are [[minority group|ethnic minorities]].{{Fact|date=August 2008}} The Democrats' positions on affirmative action, [[welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] for the lower class and unemployed, labor unions, and immigration have a strong appeal to many ethnic minorities.

====African Americans====
From the end of the Civil War, [[African American]]s favored the Republican Party. However, they began drifting to the Democratic Party in the 1930s, as [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt's]] [[New Deal]] programs gave economic relief to all minorities, including African Americans and [[Hispanic]]s. Support for the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955‚Äì1968)|Civil Rights Movement]] in the 1960s by [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] helped give the Democrats even larger support among the African American community, although their position also alienated the [[Southern strategy|Southern white]] population and led to a split in the parties, with most liberals going to the Democratic Party and most conservatives, such as the "[[Dixiecrat]]s" moving towards the Republicans. In addition, recent [[Caribbean]] and [[Africa]]n immigrants have voted solidly Democratic.

====Hispanics====
The Hispanic population, particularly the large [[Mexican American]] and [[Salvadoran American]] population in the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] and the large [[Puerto Ricans in the United States|Puerto Rican]] and [[Dominican American|Dominican]] populations in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]], have been strong supporters of the Democratic Party. They commonly favor liberal views on illegal immigration. In the [[United States presidential election, 1996|1996 presidential election]], Democratic President [[Bill Clinton]] received 72 percent of the Hispanic vote. Since then, however, the Republican Party has gained increasing support from the Hispanic community, especially among Hispanic Protestants and [[Pentecostalism|pentecostals]]. Along with Bush's much more liberal views on immigration, President Bush was the first Republican president to gain 40 percent of the Hispanic vote (he did so in the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]]). Yet, the Republican Party's support among Hispanics eroded in the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2006|2006 mid-term elections]], dropping from 44 to 30 percent, with the Democrats gaining in the Hispanic vote from 55 percent in 2004 to 69 percent in 2006.<ref name="CNN. (2004). Exit Poll."/><ref name="CNN. (2006). Exit Poll."/> The shift in the Hispanic population's support back to the Democratic party was largely due to the [[2006 United States immigration reform protests|Immigration Debate]] which was sparked by [[Border Protection, Anti-terrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005|H. R. 4437]], a Republican supported enforcement only bill concerning [[illegal immigration]]. [[Cuban American]]s still heavily vote Republican but [[Mexican American]]s, [[Puerto Ricans in the United States|Puerto Rican Americans]], [[Dominican American]]s, and [[Central America]]n and [[South America]]n immigrants have all voted dependably for Democrats.

====Asian Americans====
The Democratic Party also has considerable support in the small but growing [[Asian American]] population. The Asian population had been a stronghold of the Republican Party until the [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992 presidential election]] in which [[George H. W. Bush]] won 55% of the Asian vote, compared to [[Bill Clinton]] winning 31%, and [[Ross Perot]] winning 15% of the Asian vote. The Democrats made gains among the Asian American population starting with 1996 and in 2006, won 62% of the Asian vote. This is due to demographic shifts in the Asian American community, with growing numbers of well-educated [[Chinese American|Chinese]] and [[Indian American]] immigrants that are typically economic centrists and [[Social progressivism|social progressives]]. [[Vietnamese American]]s and [[Filipino American]]s still vote mostly Republican (though this has lessened recently), while [[Chinese American]]s, [[Indian American]]s, [[Korean American]]s, [[Japanese American]]s, [[Asian American|Southeast Asian Americans]] other than Vietnamese (especially [[Hmong American]]s, [[Cambodian American]]s, and [[Laotian American]]s,) and [[Pacific Islander American]]s have voted mostly Democratic. Younger Asian-Americans of all ethnic backgrounds between ages 18-30 have gravitated towards the Democratic Party in the last few elections.

====Native Americans====
The Democratic Party also has strong support among the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] population, particularly in [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]], [[Montana]], [[North Dakota]], [[South Dakota]], [[Washington]], [[Alaska]], [[Minnesota]], [[Wisconsin]], and [[North Carolina]].<ref>[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0508/10676.html Dems woo Native American vote]. [[Politico]]. Published 5/29/08.</ref>

====Other groups====
[[American Jews|Jewish American]] communities tend to be a stronghold for the Democratic Party, with more than 70% of Jewish voters having cast their ballots for the Democrats in the 2004 and 2006 elections.<ref name="CNN. (2004). Exit Poll."/><ref name="CNN. (2006). Exit Poll."/>

==Recent issue stances==
{{POV|date=August 2008}} 
These views are generally held by most Democrats. Some Democrats take other positions on these issues.

===Economic issues===
====Minimum wage====
Democrats favor a higher [[minimum wage]], and more regular increases, in order to assist the working poor. The [[Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007]] was an early component of the Democrats' agenda during the [[110th United States Congress|110th Congress]]. In 2006, the Democrats supported six state ballot initiatives to increase the minimum wage; all six initiatives passed.

====Renewable energy and oil====
Democrats have opposed tax cuts and incentives to oil companies, favoring a policy of developing domestic [[renewable energy]], such as [[Montana]]'s state-supported wind farm and "clean coal" programs as well as setting in place a [[Emissions trading|cap and trade policy]] in hopes of reducing carbon emissions.

====Fiscal policy====
Democrats generally support a more [[progressive tax]] structure to provide more services and reduce injustice.<ref name=how-high>[http://economics.about.com/od/monetaryandfiscalpolicy/a/high_taxes.htm How High Should Taxes Be?<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Currently they have proposed reversing those [[Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003|tax cuts the Bush administration]] gave to the wealthiest Americans while wishing to keep in place those given to the middle class.<ref name=how-high/><ref>[http://blog.cleveland.com/openers/2007/12/dems_in_debate_urge_taxes_on_w.html Dems in debate urge taxes on wealthiest - OPENERS - Ohio Politics Blog by The Plain Dealer<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Democrats generally support more government spending on social services while spending less on the military.<ref>[http://opinionjournal.com/weekend/hottopic/?id=110010876 The Wall Street Journal Online - Hot Topic<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.heritage.org/Research/budget/wm1460.cfm Budget Resolution Calls for Massive Tax Hikes and Spending Increases<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> They oppose the cutting of social services, such as [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], [[Medicaid]], and various [[welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] programs,<ref>[http://usinfo.state.gov/infousa/government/social/ch9.htm U.S. GOVERNMENT > Social Support > The Social Safety Net<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> believing it to be harmful to efficiency and social justice. Democrats believe the benefits of social services, in monetary and non-monetary terms, are a more productive labor force and cultured population, and believe that the benefits of this are greater than any benefits that could be derived from lower taxes, especially on top earners, or cuts to social services. Furthermore, Democrats see social services as essential towards providing positive freedom, i.e. freedom derived from economic opportunity. The Democratic-led House of Representatives reinstated the [[PAYGO]] (pay-as-you-go) budget rule at the start of the [[110th United States Congress|110th Congress]].<ref>{{cite news

====Health care and insurance coverage====
Democrats call for "affordable and quality health care," and many advocate an expansion of government intervention in this area. Many Democrats favor [[national health insurance]] or [[universal health care]] in a variety of forms to address the rising costs of modern health insurance. Some Democrats, such as Representative [[John Dingell]] and Senator [[Ted Kennedy|Edward Kennedy]], have called for a program of "[[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] for All."<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://energycommerce.house.gov/medicare/medicareforall.shtml Medicare for All]}}. Retrieved on [[2007-01-25]].</ref>

Some Democratic governors have supported purchasing [[Canada|Canadian]] drugs, citing lower costs and budget restrictions as a primary incentive. Recognizing that unpaid insurance bills increase costs to the service provider, who passes the cost on to health-care consumers, many Democrats advocate expansion of health insurance coverage.

==== Environment ====
Democratic belief is that the health of families and the strength of the economy depend on stewardship of the environment. Democrats have promised to fight to strengthen the laws that ensure people have clean air to breathe and clean water to drink. They also promise to make sure these laws are enforced. They feel that a sensible energy policy is key to a strong economy, national security, and a clean environment.<ref>{{cite web
|url=http://www.democrats.org/a/national/clean_environment/
|title=Agenda - Environment
|accessdate=2007-03-18}}</ref>

The Democratic Party rejects the idea that a healthy economy and a healthy environment is mutually exclusive, because they believe that a cleaner environment means a stronger economy. They protect hunting and fishing heritage by expanding conservation lands. They encourage open space and rail travel to relieve highway and airport congestion and improve air quality and economy, and "believe that communities, environmental interests, and government should work together to protect resources while ensuring the vitality of local economies. Once Americans were led to believe they had to make a choice between the economy and the environment. They now know this is a false choice."<ref>{{cite web
|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/Democratic_Party_Environment.htm
|title=Democratic Party on Environment
|accessdate=2007-10-24}}</ref>

The biggest environmental concern of the Democratic party is [[global warming]]. Democrats, most notably former Vice President [[Al Gore]], have pressed for stern regulation of [[greenhouse gas]]es. On [[October 15]] [[2007]] he won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his efforts to build greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and laying the foundations for the measures needed to counteract these changes. asserting that "the climate crisis is not a political issue, it is a moral and spiritual challenge to all of humanity."<ref>{{cite journal

====College education====
Most Democrats have the long term aim of having low-cost, publicly-funded college education with low tuition fees (like in much of Europe and Canada) which should be available to every eligible American student, or alternatively, with increasing state funding for student financial aid such as the [[Pell Grant]] or college tuition [[tax deduction]].<ref>{{cite web

====Trade agreements====
The Democratic Party has a mixed record on [[international trade]] agreements that reflects a diversity of viewpoints in the party. The liberal and [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] wing of the party, including the intelligentsia and college-educated professionals overall, tend to favor [[globalization]], while the organized labor wing of the party opposes it.<ref name="Rorty, R. (1997). ''Achieving Our Country: Leftist Though In Twenthieth Century America''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.">Rorty, R. (1997). ''Achieving Our Country: Leftist Though In Twenthieth Century America''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.</ref> In the 1990s, the Clinton administration and a number of prominent Democrats pushed through a number of agreements such as the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA). Since then, the party's shift away from free trade became evident in the [[Dominican Republic ‚Äì Central America Free Trade Agreement|Central American Free Trade Agreement]] (CAFTA) vote, with 15 House Democrats voting for the agreement and 187 voting against.<ref>{{cite news

In his 1997 ''Achieving Our Country'', [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Richard Rorty]], [[professor]] at [[Stanford University]] states that economic globalization "invites two responses from the Left. The first is to insist that the inequalities between nations need to be mitigated... The second is to insist that the primary responsibility of each democratic nation-state is to its own least advantaged citizens... the first response suggests that the old democracies should open their borders, whereas the second suggests that they should close them. The first response comes naturally to academic leftists, who have always been internationally minded. The second comes naturally to members of trade unions, and to marginally employed people who can most easily be recruited into right-wing populist movements." (p. 88)<ref name="Rorty, R. (1997).

''Achieving Our Country: Leftist Though In Twentieth Century America''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.</ref>

====Alternative Minimum Tax====
While the Democratic Party is in support of a progressive tax structure, it has vowed to adjust the [[Alternative Minimum Tax]] (AMT). The tax was originally designed to tax the rich but now may affect many households, especially those with [[Income in the United States|incomes]] between $75,000 to $100,000. The party proposed to re-adjust the tax in such manner as to restore its initial intention. According to a 2007 Reuters News Report, "House Ways and Means Committee Chairman [[Charles B. Rangel]] has said he will push for permanent AMT relief for those taxpayers who were never meant to pay it."<ref>{{cite web

===Social issues===
====Discrimination====
The Democratic Party supports [[equal opportunity]] for all Americans regardless of sex, age, race, sexual orientation, religion, creed, or national origin. 

Democrats also strongly support the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans with Disabilities Act]] to prohibit discrimination against people on the basis of physical or mental disability. 

====LGBT rights====
The Democratic Party is divided on the subject of [[same-sex marriage]]. Some members favor [[civil union]]s for same-sex couples, liberals commonly favor legalized marriage, and others are opposed to same-sex marriage on religious or ideological grounds. A June 2008 ''[[Newsweek]]'' poll found that 42% of Democrats support it while 23% support [[civil union]]s or [[domestic partnership]] laws and 28% oppose any legal recognition at all.<ref>[http://www.pollingreport.com/civil.htm Civil Rights related polls from] [http://www.pollingreport.com/ Pollingreport]</ref> The 2004 Democratic National Platform stated that marriage should be defined at the state level and it repudiated the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]].<ref name="platform"/> Senator John Kerry, Democratic presidential candidate in 2004, did not support same-sex marriage. Most Democrats have supported other civil rights laws such as extending [[hate crime]] statutes to cover [[violence against LGBT people]].

====Reproductive rights====
Most members of the Democratic Party believe that all women should have access to [[birth control]], and supports public funding of contraception for poor women. The Democratic Party, in its national platforms since 1992, has called for [[abortion]] to be "safe, legal and rare" ‚Äî namely, keeping it legal by rejecting laws that allow governmental interference in abortion decisions, and reducing the number of abortions by promoting both knowledge of reproduction and contraception, and incentives for adoption. When Congress voted on the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]] in 2003, Congressional Democrats were split, with a minority (including current [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]] [[Harry Reid]]) supporting the ban, and the majority of Democrats opposing the legislation.

The Democratic Party opposes attempts to reverse the 1973 Supreme Court decision ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', which declared abortion to be a constitutionally-protected right, and ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'' which lays out the legal framework in which government action alleged to violate that right is assessed by courts. As a matter of the [[Privacy|right to privacy]] and of [[gender equality]], many Democrats believe all women should have the ability to choose to abort without governmental interference. They believe that each woman, conferring with her conscience, has the right to choose for herself whether abortion is morally correct. Many Democrats also believe that poor women should have a right to publicly funded abortions.

Current [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]] [[Harry Reid]] self-identifies as '[[pro-life]]', while 2008 Presidential candidate Barack Obama and current [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Nancy Pelosi]] self-identify as '[[pro-choice]]'. The pro-life [[political faction|faction]] in the Party is represented by groups such as [[Democrats for Life of America]] while the pro-choice [[political faction|faction]] is represented by groups such as [[EMILY's List]]. A ''[[Newsweek]]'' poll from October 2006 found that 25% of Democrats were pro-life while a 69% majority were pro-choice.<ref>[http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htm Abortion related polls from] [http://www.pollingreport.com/ Pollingreport].</ref>

====Stem cell research====
The Democratic Party has voiced overwhelming support for all [[stem cell|stem cell research]] with federal funding. In his 2004 platform, [[John Kerry]] affirmed his support of federally-funded stem cell research "under the strictest ethical guidelines," saying, "We will not walk away from the chance to save lives and reduce human suffering."<ref name="platform">{{PDF|[http://www.democrats.org/pdfs/2004platform.pdf The 2004 Democratic National Platform]|111&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 114452 bytes -->}} </ref>

=== Foreign policy issues ===
==== Invasion of Afghanistan ====
Democrats in the House of Representatives and United States Senate near-unanimously voted for the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists]] against "those responsible for the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|recent attacks launched against the United States]]" in [[Afghanistan]] in 2001, supporting the [[NATO]] coalition invasion of the nation.

====Iraq War====
In 2002, Democrats were divided as a majority (29 for, 21 against) in the Senate and a minority of Democrats in the House (81 for, 126 against) voted for the [[Iraq Resolution|Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq]]. Since then, many prominent Democrats, such as former Senator [[John Edwards]], have expressed regret about this decision, and have called it a mistake, while others, such as Senator [[Hillary Rodham Clinton|Hillary Clinton]] have criticized the conduct of the war but not repudiated their initial vote for it. Referring to Iraq, in April 2007 [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]] [[Harry Reid]] declared the war to be "lost" while other Democrats (especially during the 2004 presidential election cycle) accused the President of lying to the public about WMDs in [[Iraq]]. Amongst lawmakers, Democrats are the most vocal opponents of [[Iraq War#2003: Invasion|Operation Iraqi Freedom]] and campaigned on a platform of withdrawal ahead of the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 mid-term elections]].

Democrats in the House of Representatives near-unanimously supported a [[non-binding resolution]] disapproving of President Bush's decision to send [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|additional troops into Iraq in 2007]]. Congressional Democrats overwhelmingly supported military funding legislation which included a provision that set "a timeline for the withdrawal of all US combat troops from Iraq" by [[March 31]] [[2008]], but also would leave combat forces in Iraq for purposes such as targeted counter-terrorism operations.<ref>{{cite news | last = Flaherty

A March 2003 [[CBS News]] poll taken a few days before the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] found that 34% of Democrats would support it without United Nations backing, 51% would support it only with its backing, and 14% would not support it at all.<ref>[http://www.pollingreport.com/iraq16.htm Archive page #16 of polls from] [http://www.pollingreport.com/ Pollingreport]</ref> ''[[Los Angeles Times|The Los Angeles Times]]'' stated in early April 2003 that 70% of Democrats supported the decision to invade while 27% opposed it.<ref>[http://www.pollingreport.com/iraq15.htm Archive page #15 of polls from] [http://www.pollingreport.com/ Pollingreport]</ref> The [[Pew Research Center]] stated in August 2007 that opposition increased from 37% during the initial invasion to 74%.<ref>[http://pewresearch.org/pubs/579/iraq-vietnam Pew Research Center: Along the Iraq-Vietnam Parallel].

Bush|Bush administration]]'s conduct and want to end the war within the next year.<ref>[http://www.pollingreport.com/iraq.htm Recent polls from] [http://www.pollingreport.com/ Pollingreport]</ref>

====Unilateralism====
Democrats usually oppose the doctrine of [[unilateralism]], which dictates that the United States should use military force without any assistance from other nations whenever it believes there is a threat to its security or welfare. They believe the United States should act in the international arena in concert with strong alliances and broad international support. This was a major foreign policy issue of [[John Kerry]]'s 2004 presidential campaign; his platform attributed rifts with international allies to unilateralism.

In a general sense, the modern Democratic Party is more closely aligned with the [[international relations theory|international relations theories]] of [[liberal international relations theory|liberalism]], [[neoliberalism in international relations|neoliberalism]], and [[functionalism in international relations|functionalism]] than [[Political realism|realism]] and [[Neorealism (international relations)|neorealism]], though realism has some influence on the party.

====Political status of Puerto Rico====
The Democratic Party have expressed their support for Puerto Ricans to exercise their right to decolonization. The following are the appropriate section from the 2000 and 2004 party platforms:

'''Democratic Party 2004 Platform'''

We believe that four million disenfranchised American citizens residing in [[Puerto Rico]] have the
right to the permanent and fully democratic status of their choice. The White House and Congress
will clarify the realistic status options for Puerto Rico and enable Puerto Ricans to choose among them.<ref name="platform"/>

'''Democratic Party 2000 Platform'''

Puerto Rico has been under U.S. sovereignty for over a century and Puerto Ricans have been U.S. citizens since 1917, but the island‚Äôs ultimate status still has not been determined and its 3.9 million residents still do not have voting representation in their national government. These disenfranchised citizens ‚Äì who have contributed greatly to our country in war and peace ‚Äì are entitled to the permanent and fully democratic status of their choice. Democrats will continue to work in the White House and Congress to clarify the options and enable them to choose and to obtain such a status from among all realistic options.<ref>[http://www.letpuertoricodecide.com/details.php?cid=4 Let Puerto Rico Decide: An Introduction to Puerto Rico's Status Debate<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

=== Legal issues ===
==== Torture ====
Democrats are opposed to use of [[torture]] against individuals apprehended and held prisoner by the [[Military of the United States|U.S. military]], and hold that categorizing such prisoners as [[unlawful combatant]]s does not release the U.S. from its obligations under the [[Geneva Conventions]]. Democrats contend that torture is inhumane, decreases the United States' moral standing in the world, and produces questionable results.

====USA PATRIOT Act====
All Democrats in the U.S. Senate, except for [[Russ Feingold]] of [[Wisconsin]], voted for the original [[USA PATRIOT Act]] legislation. After voicing concerns over the "invasion of privacy" and other [[civil liberties|civil liberty]] restrictions of the Act, the Democrats split on the renewal in 2006. Most Democratic Senators voted to renew it, while most Democratic Representatives voted against renewal. Renewal was allowed after many of the most invasive clauses in the Act were removed or curbed.

====Right to privacy====
The Democratic Party believes that individuals should have a [[privacy law|right to privacy]]. For example, Democrats have generally opposed the [[NSA warrantless surveillance controversy|NSA warrantless surveillance of U.S. citizens]].

Some Democratic officeholders have championed [[consumer protection]] laws that limit the sharing of consumer data between corporations. Most Democrats oppose [[Sodomy laws in the United States|sodomy laws]] and believe that government should not regulate consensual noncommercial sexual conduct among adults as a matter of personal privacy. 

====Gun control====
With a stated goal of reducing crime and homicide, the Democratic Party has introduced various [[Gun politics in the United States|gun control]] measures, most notably the [[Gun Control Act of 1968]], the [[Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act|Brady Bill]] of 1993 and Crime Control Act of 1994. However, many Democrats, especially rural, Southern, and Western Democrats, favor fewer restrictions on firearm possession and warned the party was defeated in the 2000 presidential election in rural areas because of the issue.<ref>{{cite news

==Economic performance==
In ''Unequal democracy: The political-economy of the new gilded age'' (Princeton, 2008), [[Princeton University|Princeton]] political scientist [[Larry Bartels]] presents his research findings that Democratic presidents have generally been more successful in both, spurring overall [[Income in the United States|income]] growth and creating a more equitable distribution of income since World War II (see table). After allowing for a one year time lag between assuming office and the effects of policies, and accounting for several economic events that could have caused such a development, such as oil prices and labor force participation, Bartels finds that the correlation with a Democratic presidency and higher income growth remains significant. He concludes that correlation between higher and more equally distributed income growth and the incumbency of Democratic presidents is likely not a mere repeated coincidence. Bartels conducts the same calculations for pre-tax for two periods: 1948-2005 and 1980-2005, and post-tax incomes for the period from 1980-2005, coming to the same conclusions.<ref name="Bartels">Bartels, L. M. (2008). ''Unequal democracy: The political economy of the new gilded age''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.</ref>

Bartels also finds that unemployment and inflation tended to be lower and GNP growth higher under Democratic presidents. Regarding income inequality, Bartels points out that had Democratic presidents continously held office since 1945 inequality would be, ceteris paribus, roughly the same today as in 1945.<ref name="Bartels"/>

==History==
{{main|History of the United States Democratic Party}}

The Democratic Party evolved from [[Anti-Administration Party (United States)|Anti-Federalist]] factions that opposed the [[Hamiltonian economic program|fiscal policies]] of [[Alexander Hamilton]] in the early 1790s. [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]] organized these factions into the [[Democratic-Republican Party]]. The party favored states' rights and strict adherence to the Constitution; it opposed a national bank and wealthy, moneyed interests. The Democratic-Republican Party ascended to power in the [[United States presidential election, 1800|election of 1800]]. After the [[War of 1812]], the party's chief rival, the [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist Party]] disbanded. Democratic-Republicans split over the choice of a successor to President [[James Monroe]], and the party faction that supported many of the old Jeffersonian principles, led by [[Andrew Jackson]] and [[Martin Van Buren]], became the Democratic Party. Along with the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], the Democratic Party was the chief party in the United States until the Civil War. The Whigs were a commercial party, and usually less popular, if better financed. The Whigs divided over the slavery issue after the [[Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War]] and faded away. In the 1850s, under the stress of the [[Fugitive slave laws|Fugitive Slave Law]] and the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]], anti-slavery Democrats left the party. Joining with former members of existing or dwindling parties, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] emerged.

The Democrats split over the choice of a successor to President [[James Buchanan]] along Northern and Southern lines, while the Republican Party gained an ascendancy in the [[United States presidential election, 1860|election of 1860]]. As the [[American Civil War]] broke out, Northern Democrats were divided into [[War Democrats]] and [[Copperheads (politics)|Peace Democrats]]. Most War Democrats rallied to Republican President [[Abraham Lincoln]] and the Republicans' [[National Union Party (United States)|National Union Party]]. The Democrats benefited from white Southerners' resentment of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] after the war and consequent hostility to the Republican Party. After [[Redeemers]] ended Reconstruction in the 1870s, and the extremely violent disenfranchisement of African Americans took place in the 1890s, the South, voting Democratic, became known as the "[[Solid South]]." Though Republicans continued to control the White House until 1884, the Democrats remained competitive. The party was dominated by pro-business [[Bourbon Democrat]]s led by [[Samuel J. Tilden]] and [[Grover Cleveland]], who represented mercantile, banking and railroad interests, opposed imperialism and overseas expansion, fought for the gold standard, opposed bimetallism, and crusaded against corruption, high taxes, and tariffs. Cleveland was elected to non-consecutive presidential terms in 1884 and 1892.

Agrarian Democrats demanding [[Free Silver]] overthrew the Bourbon Democrats in 1896 and nominated [[William Jennings Bryan]] for the presidency (a nomination repeated by Democrats in 1900 and 1908). Bryan waged a vigorous campaign attacking Eastern moneyed interests, but he lost to Republican [[William McKinley]]. The Democrats took control of the House in 1910 and elected [[Woodrow Wilson]] as president in 1912 and 1916. Wilson led Congress to, in effect, put to rest the issues of tariffs, money, and antitrust that had dominated politics for 40 years with new progressive laws. The [[Great Depression]] in 1929 that occurred under Republican President [[Herbert Hoover]] and the Republican Congress set the stage for a more liberal government; the Democrats controlled the House of Representatives nearly uninterrupted from 1931 until 1995 and won most presidential elections until 1968. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], elected to presidency in 1932, came forth with government programs called the [[New Deal]]. New Deal liberalism meant the promotion of social welfare, labor unions, civil rights, and regulation of business. The opponents, who stressed long-term growth, support for business, and low taxes, started calling themselves "conservatives." 

Issues facing parties and the United States after the [[World War II|Second World War]] included the [[Cold War]] and the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955‚Äì1968)|Civil Rights Movement]]. Republicans attracted conservatives and white Southerners from the Democratic coalition with their resistance to New Deal and [[Great Society]] liberalism and the Republicans' use of the [[Southern strategy]]. African Americans, who traditionally supported the Republican Party, began supporting Democrats following the ascent of the Franklin Roosevelt administration, the New Deal, and the Civil Rights movement. The Democratic Party's main base of support shifted to the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]], marking a dramatic reversal of history. [[Bill Clinton]] was elected to the presidency in 1992, governing as a [[New Democrats|New Democrat]] when the Democratic Party lost control of Congress in the [[Republican Revolution|election of 1994]] to the Republican Party. Re‚Äìelected in 1996, Clinton was the first Democratic President since Franklin Roosevelt to serve for two terms. The Democratic Party regained majority control of Congress in the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 elections]]. Some of the party's key issues in the early 21st century in their last national platform have included the methods of how to combat terrorism, homeland security, expanding access to health care, labor rights, environmentalism, and the preservation of liberal government programs.

Initially calling itself the "Republican Party," Jeffersonians were labeled "Democratic" by the opposition [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalists]], with the hope of stigmatizing them as purveyors of democracy or mob rule.<ref>{{cite book

}}</ref> In the 20th and 21st centuries, "[[Democrat Party (phrase)|Democrat Party]]" is a political [[epithet]] that is sometimes used by opponents to refer to the party. The current official name of the party is the "Democratic Party."

The most common mascot symbol for the party is the [[donkey]]. According to the [[Democratic National Committee]], the party itself never officially adopted this symbol but has made use of it.<ref>[http://www.democrats.org/a/2005/06/history_of_the.php History of the Democratic Donkey]. Retrieved on [[2006-11-15]].</ref> They say [[Andrew Jackson]] had been labeled a jackass by his opponents during the intense mudslinging that occurred during the presidential race of [[United States presidential election, 1828|1828]]. A [[editorial cartoon|political cartoon]] depicting Jackson riding and directing a donkey (representing the Democratic Party) was published in 1837. A political cartoon by [[Thomas Nast]] in an 1870 edition of ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's Weekly]]'' revived the donkey as a symbol for the Democratic Party. Cartoonists followed Nast and used the donkey to represent the Democrats, and the elephant to represent the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]].

In the early 20th century, the traditional symbol of the Democratic Party in [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern states]] such as [[Indiana]], [[Kentucky]], [[Oklahoma]] and [[Ohio]] was the [[rooster]], as opposed to the Republican [[eagle]]. This symbol still appears on Oklahoma, Kentucky, and Indiana [[ballot]]s. For the majority of the 20th century, [[Missouri]] Democrats used the [[Statue of Liberty]] as their ballot [[emblem]]. This meant that when [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] candidates received [[ballot access]] in Missouri in 1976, they could not use the Statue of Liberty, their national symbol, as the ballot emblem. Missouri Libertarians instead used the [[Liberty Bell]] until 1995, when the [[mule]] became Missouri's state animal. From 1995 to 2004, there was some confusion among voters, as the Democratic ticket was marked with the Statue of Liberty, and it seemed that the Libertarians were using a donkey.

Although both major political parties (and many minor ones) use the traditional American red, white, and blue colors in their marketing and representations, since election night [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]] the color blue has become the identified color of the Democratic Party, while the color red has become the identified color of the Republican Party. That night, for the first time, all major broadcast television networks used the same color scheme for the electoral map: [[Red states and blue states|blue states]] for [[Al Gore]] (Democratic nominee) and red states for [[George W. Bush]] (Republican nominee). Since then, the color blue has been widely used by the media to represent the party, much to the confusion of non-American observers, as blue is the traditional color of the [[right-wing politics|right]] and red the color of the [[left-wing politics|left]] outside of the United States (c.f. red for the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] and blue for the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservatives]] in [[Canada]], or red for [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and blue for [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] in the [[United Kingdom]]). Blue has also been used by party supporters for promotional efforts (e.g [[ActBlue]], BuyBlue, BlueFund) and by the party itself, which in 2006 unveiled the "Red to Blue Program" to support Democratic candidates running against Republican incumbents in the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 midterm elections]].

The song "[[Happy Days Are Here Again]]" is the unofficial song of the Democratic Party. It was used prominently when [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] was nominated for president at the [[1932 Democratic National Convention]] and remains a sentimental favorite for Democrats today. For example [[Paul Shaffer]] played the theme after the Democrats won Congress in 2006. More recently, the emotionally similar song "[[Beautiful Day]]" by the band [[U2]] has become a favorite theme song for Democratic candidates. [[John Kerry]] used the song during his 2004 presidential campaign, and it was used as a celebratory tune by several Democratic Congressional candidates in 2006.<ref>{{cite news
