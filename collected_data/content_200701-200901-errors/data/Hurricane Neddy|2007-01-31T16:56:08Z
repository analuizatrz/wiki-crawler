"'''Hurricane Neddy'''" is the eighth episode from the [[List of The Simpsons episodes#Season 8 (1996-1997)|eighth season]] of ''[[The Simpsons]]''.

==Synopsis==
{{spoiler}}
Homer lazily enjoys his latest mid-afternoon nap when the winds begin to pick up. Lisa consults her weather instruments and a question-and-answer book and determines a hurricane may soon strike Springfield. Panicked residents quickly gather supplies and food at nearby stores, but [[Ned Flanders|Ned]] remains calm as the main storm approaches.

As various hurricane-related gags play out throughout Springfield, the Simpsons do their best at family bonding. The storm finally passes, and everyone is overjoyed that the storm caused no damage to their home. However, the Flanders family is not so lucky ... Ned's house is the only one that has been destroyed.

Ned is relieved that his family escaped serious injury, but that's of little solace since he does not have homeowner's insurance (having considered insurance "gambling"). The Flanders family is forced to move to the church basement. There, he watches news accounts of the storm's aftermath, and is further discouraged when he is told that the Leftorium had been looted. Seeking answers from God, [[Maude Flanders|Maude]] and [[List of recurring characters from The Simpsons#Lovejoy Family|Rev. Lovejoy]] attempt to reassure Ned things will work out fine.

In an attempt to show their community spirit and friendship, Marge commissions everyone in Springfield to rebuild the Flanders' home. The job is completed in record time, and Ned is overjoyed ... that is, until he inspects their workmanship, which turns out to be  (at best) shoddy; for example, the door to the main bedroom is only large enough to accommodate a cat at best, although the room itself is apparently its normal size. The makeshift house soon crumbles, and Ned tries containing his anger ... but his temper explodes. He angrily speaks his mind about everyone's efforts, then rants on about specific residents, such as Krusty and Bart, ending his tirade by calling Homer "the worst human being I have ever met!"

Fearing he has lost his mind and on the verge of a [[nervous breakdown|mental breakdown]], Ned checks himself into the Calmwood Mental Hospital to seek therapy. There, he is treated by his childhood [[psychiatrist]], Dr. Foster, who reminds Ned that – because his parents did not believe in childhood discipline – he was a rambunctious, out-of-control child in need of psychiatric counseling. That therapy involved eight months of continuous spanking, but instead of reforming Ned, it rendered him unable to express any anger at all and resulted in his trademark nonsencial jabbering at moments when he was particularly close to losing his temper.  This caused Ned to unknowingly repress his anger, until it built up inside him and erupted in his tirade of insults at the townspeople.

Dr. Foster, now having seen that his earlier therapy was inappropriate, enlists Homer to help Ned learn to appropriately express his emotions, as Homer is the person Ned harbours particularly resentful feelings towards. After several flubbed tries, such as Homer claiming to have slept with Maude, Ned finally admits he resents his [[beatnik]] parents because of his upbringing, and suddenly he feels like a weight has been lifted from his shoulders.

Shortly thereafter, Ned is released from Calmwood, and tells everyone he'll try harder at expressing his feelings and letting them know when he is upset, such as when he's really angry "I'm gonna run you down with my car".

{{ListGenBot-SourceStart|SimpsonsTrivia|SimpsonsTriviaS08}}
* In the crowd scene at the end, outside the mental hospital, one of the signs reads "Free [[John Swartzwelder]]". John Swartzwelder is a long-time writer on the Simpsons. Swartzwelder himself is seen in one of the mental institution cells, he quickly closes the door as he sees the Simpson family approaching.
* Ms. Lucille Botzcowski (also known as Botz, the Babysitter Bandit.) from 7G01 - "[[Some Enchanted Evening (The Simpsons episode)|Some Enchanted Evening]]" makes a cameo appearance pacing around in her cell.
* “[[The Critic]]”—Jay Sherman—from 2F31 (“[[A Star Is Burns]]”) makes a cameo appearance as well, telling his doctor, "It stinks! It stinks! It ''stinks''!"; the doctor's response to humor him: "That's right, Mr. Sherman. ''Everything'' stinks."  ''The Critic'' had recently been cancelled, and this was the writers' explanation as to why (''The Critic'' creators [[Al Jean]] and [[Mike Reiss]] were the show runners when Oakley and Weinstein were hired to ''The Simpsons'' staff). Also, in the closing credits Jon Lovitz is credited so he probably came in for that small part, seeing as how he had no other part in the episode. (Dr. Foster was [[Hank Azaria]]).
*Dr. Foster is later seen in "[[It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Marge]]", this time sporting a toupee.
* [[Todd Flanders|Todd]] is wearing a [[Butthole Surfers]] shirt when the Flanders family is in the relief center ("Look, Dad! I'm a ''surfer''!"). The censors, however, only allowed "Buttho Surfers".

* ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' – as in the episode "[[When Flanders Failed]]", Homer leads the town to aid Flanders in his darkest hour, though on this occasion the results are far worse.
* ''[[The Critic]]'' – [[Jay Sherman]] makes a cameo appearance in the mental hospital scenes. The ''Simpsons'' writers joked that this is what ''really'' happened to the character after the series was cancelled. ''Critic'' fans, however, don't consider this appearance part of the series' canon.
* [[Dick Tracy]] and [[Pruneface]] – Ned's "Prune Tracy" remark is a pun on the comic strip detective.  It's also an allusion to an off-color joke.  Given the progression, the next name would be Dick Face, had Dr. Foster not stopped him.
* [[Book of Job|Job]] – The plot of the episode is very similar to that of the Book of Job in the [[Bible]].
* ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'' – Several scenes at Calmwood Mental Hospital are taken from the 1975 movie.
* [[Swanson]] [[TV dinner]]s – The Juvenile Aggression Study film is sponsored by Swanson Angry Man Dinners, a play on Swanson Hungry Man Dinners.
