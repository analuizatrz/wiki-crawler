'''Homeopathy''' (also homœopathy or homoeopathy; from the Greek ''ὅμοιος'', ''hómoios'', "[[Similarity|similar]]" + ''πάθος'', ''páthos'', "[[suffering]]" or "[[disease]]") is a form of [[alternative medicine]] first defined by [[Samuel Hahnemann]] in the 18th century.<ref name="homhist1"/> Homeopathic practitioners contend that an ill person can be treated using a substance that can produce, in a healthy person, [[symptom]]s similar to those of the illness.  According to homeopaths, [[serial dilution]], with shaking between each dilution, removes the [[Toxicity|toxic]] effects of the [[Medication|remedy]] while the qualities of the substance are retained by the [[diluent]] (water, sugar, or alcohol). The end product is often so diluted that it is indistinguishable from pure water, sugar or alcohol.<ref name="Dynamization and Dilution">{{cite news | title= Dynamization and Dilution | publisher= Creighton University Department of Pharmacology | url =http://altmed.creighton.edu/Homeopathy/philosophy/dilution.htm | accessdate = 2007-10-09 }}</ref><ref>Smith, Trevor.

===18th-century medicine===
At the time of the inception of homeopathy, the late [[1700s]], mainstream medicine employed such measures as [[bloodletting]] and purging, the use of [[laxative]]s and [[enema]]s, and the administration of complex mixtures, such as [[Venice treacle]], which was made from 64 substances including opium, myrrh, and viper's flesh.<ref>* {{Harvard reference

===Hahnemann's concept===
[[Image:Samuel Hahnemann.png|thumb|left|[[Samuel Hahnemann]], considered to be the father of homeopathy]]

[[Samuel Hahnemann]] conceived of homeopathy while translating a medical treatise by [[Scotland|Scottish]] physician and chemist [[William Cullen]] into [[German language|German]].<ref name="homhist1"/> Being sceptical of Cullen’s theory concerning [[cinchona]]’s action in [[malaria]], Hahnemann ingested some of the bark specifically to see if it cured fever "by virtue of its effect of strengthening the stomach".<ref>http://www.iavh.org/homeopathy/history/ ''History of Homeopathy,'' IAVH</ref> Upon ingesting the bark, he noticed few stomach symptoms, but did experience [[fever]], [[shivering]] and [[arthralgia|joint pain]], symptoms similar to some of the early symptoms of [[malaria]], the disease that the bark was ordinarily used to treat. From this, Hahnemann came to believe that all effective drugs produce symptoms in healthy individuals similar to those of the diseases that they can treat. This later became known as the "law of similars", the most important concept of homeopathy.<ref name=homhist1>{{cite news |title=History of Homeopathy |publisher=[[Creighton University]] Department of Pharmacology |url=http://altmed.creighton.edu/Homeopathy/history.htm |accessdate=2007-07-23 }}</ref> The term "homeopathy" was coined by Hahnemann and first appeared in print in 1807, although he began outlining his theories of "medical similars" in a series of articles and monographs in 1796.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Homeopathy and "the progress of science" |journal=History of science; an annual review of literature, research and teaching |date=2001 |first=Michael |last=Emmans Dean |volume=39 |issue=125 Pt 3 |pages=255–83 |id=PMID 11712570 |url=http://www.shpltd.co.uk/dean-homeopathy.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-10-02 }}</ref>

Hahnemann began to test what effects substances produced in humans, a procedure which would later become known as "proving".<ref name=homproving>{{cite web |url=http://altmed.creighton.edu/Homeopathy/philosophy/provings.htm |title=Homeopathic Provings |accessdate=2007-10-02 |publisher=[[Creighton University]] School of Medicine }}</ref> These time-consuming tests required subjects to clearly record all of their symptoms as well as the ancillary conditions under which they appeared. Hahnemann saw this data as a way of identifying substances suitable for the treatment of particular diseases.<ref name="homproving"/> The first collection of provings was published in 1805 and a second collection of 65 remedies appeared in his book, ''Materia Medica Pura'', in [[1810]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Kirschmann |first=Anne Taylor |title=A Vital Force: Women in American Homeopathy |publisher=Rutgers University Press |date=December 2003 |isbn=978-0813533209 }}</ref> Hahnemann believed that large doses of drugs that caused similar symptoms would only aggravate illness, and so he advocated extreme dilutions of the substances; he devised a technique for making dilutions that he believed would preserve a substance's therapeutic properties while removing its harmful effects,<ref name=homeodilut>{{cite web |url=http://altmed.creighton.edu/Homeopathy/philosophy/dilution.htm |title=Homeopathic Dynamization and Dilution |accessdate=2007-10-02 |publisher=[[Creighton University]] School of Medicine }}</ref> proposing that this process aroused and enhanced "spirit-like medicinal powers held within a drug".<ref>[http://www.hpathy.com/philosophy/hahnemann-organon261to270.asp ''Organon of Medicine,''] Samuel Hahnemann, combined 5th/6th edition</ref> He gathered and published a complete overview of his new medical system in his 1810 book, ''[[The Organon of the Healing Art]]'', whose 6th edition, published in [[1921]], is still used by homeopaths today.<ref name="homhist1"/>

===Rise to popularity and early criticism===
During the 19th century homeopathy grew in popularity. In 1830, the first homeopathic schools opened, and throughout the 19th century dozens of homeopathic institutions appeared in [[Europe]] and the [[United States]].<ref name=Julian>{{cite web|url=http://www.wholehealthnow.com/homeopathy_pro/homeopathy_1825_1849.html |title=Homeopathy Timeline |accessdate=2007-07-23 |last=Winston |first=Julian |date=2006 |work="The Faces of Homoeopathy" |publisher=Whole Health Now }}</ref> Because of mainstream medicine's reliance on [[blood-letting]] and untested, often dangerous medicines, patients of homeopaths often had better outcomes than those of mainstream doctors.<ref name="pmid8885813">{{cite journal |author=Ernst E, Kaptchuk TJ |title=Homeopathy revisited |journal=Arch.

In the early 19th century, homeopathy began to be criticised. [[John Forbes (physician)|Sir John Forbes]], physician to [[Queen Victoria]], said the extremely small doses of homeopathy were regularly derided as useless, laughably ridiculous and "an outrage to human reason".<ref>Sir John Forbes, ''Homeopathy, Allopathy and Young Physic'', London, 1846</ref> Professor Sir [[James Young Simpson]] said of the highly diluted drugs: "No poison, however strong or powerful, the billionth or decillionth of which would in the least degree affect a man or harm a fly."<ref>James Y Simpson, ''Homoeopathy, Its Tenets and Tendencies, Theoretical, Theological and Therapeutical'', Edinburgh: Sutherland & Knox, 1853, 11</ref> Nineteenth century American physician and author [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.]] was also a vocal critic of homeopathy and published an essay in 1842 entitled ''Homœopathy, and its Kindred Delusions''.<ref>{{cite book

==General philosophy==
Homeopathy is a [[vitalism|vitalist]] philosophy in that it regards diseases and sickness to be caused by disturbances in a hypothetical [[vital force]] or [[spiritual energy|life force]] in humans and that these disturbances manifest themselves as unique symptoms. Homeopathy contends that the vital force has the ability to react and adapt to internal and external causes, which homeopaths refer to as the "law of susceptibility". The law of susceptibility states that a negative state of mind can attract hypothetical disease entities called "miasms" to invade the body and produce symptoms of diseases.<ref name="homhist1"/> However, Hahnemann rejected the notion of a disease as a separate thing or invading entity<ref>{{cite web|url=http://julianwinston.com/archives/articles/winston_organon_outline.php |title=Outline of the Organon |accessdate=2007-08-04 |last=Winston |first=Julian }}</ref> and insisted that it was always part of the "living whole".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.homeopathyhome.com/reference/organon/organon.html |title=Organon Of Medicine |accessdate=2007-08-04 |last=Hahnemann |first=Samuel }}</ref>

===Law of similars===
Hahnemann observed from his experiments with [[cinchona]] bark, used as a treatment for [[malaria]], that the effects he experienced from ingesting the bark were similar to the symptoms of malaria. He therefore reasoned that cure proceeds through similarity, and that treatments must be able to produce symptoms in healthy individuals similar to those of the disease being treated. Through further experiments with other substances, Hahnemann conceived of the "law of similars", otherwise known as "like cures like" ({{lang-la|similia similibus curentur}}) as a fundamental healing principle. He believed that by inducing a disease through use of drugs, the artificial symptoms empowered the vital force to neutralise and expel the original disease and that this artificial disturbance would naturally subside when the dosing ceased.<ref name="homhist1"/>

===Miasms and disease===
Hahnemann found as early as 1816 that the patients he treated through homeopathy still suffered from chronic diseases that he was unable to cure.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lyghtforce.com/HomeopathyOnline/Issue2/educate.html |accessdate=[[2007-10-12]] |author=David Little | title=The Classical View on Miasms | publisher = Homeopathy Online}}</ref> In 1828,<ref>The Chronic Diseases, their Nature and Homoeopathic Treatment, [[Dresden]] and Leipsic, Arnold. Vols. 1, 2, 3, 1828; vol. 4, 1830</ref> he introduced the concept of miasms, which he regarded as underlying causes for many known diseases. A miasm is often defined by homeopaths as an imputed "peculiar morbid derangement of our vital force".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.homeopathyhome.com/reference/organon/10.html |author=Samuel Hahnemann |title=Organon, 5th edition, para 29 |publisher=Homeopathy Home.com. |accessdate=2007-10-22 }}</ref> Hahnemann associated each miasm with specific diseases, with each miasm seen as the root cause of several diseases. According to Hahnemann, initial exposure to miasms causes local symptoms, such as skin or venereal diseases, but if these symptoms are suppressed by medication, the cause goes deeper and begins to manifest itself as diseases of the internal organs.<ref name="ntlworld"/> Homeopathy contends that treating diseases by directly opposing their symptoms, as is sometimes done in conventional medicine, is not so effective because all "disease can generally be traced to some latent, deep-seated, underlying chronic, or inherited tendency".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://homeoint.org/cazalet/ward/historycase.htm |author=Dr J W Ward |title=Taking the History of the Case |publisher=Pacific Coast Jnl of Homeopathy, July 1937 |accessdate=2007-10-22}}</ref> The underlying imputed miasm still remains, and deep-seated ailments can only be corrected by removing the deeper disturbance of the vital force.<ref name=homphilo>{{cite news |title=Cause of Disease in homeopathy |date= |publisher=Creighton University Department of Pharmacology |url=http://altmed.creighton.edu/Homeopathy/philosophy/cause.htm |accessdate=2007-07-23 }}</ref>

Hahnemann's miasm theory remains disputed and controversial within homeopathy even in modern times. In [[1978]], [[Anthony Campbell]], then a consultant physician at The Royal London Homeopathic Hospital, criticised statements by George Vithoulkas claiming that [[syphilis]], when treated with antibiotics, would develop into secondary and tertiary syphilis with involvement of the central nervous system. This conflicts with scientific studies, which indicate that penicillin treatment produces a complete cure of syphilis in more than 90% of cases.<ref name="Birnbaum">{{cite journal |author=Birnbaum NR, Goldschmidt RH, Buffett WO |title=Resolving the common clinical dilemmas of syphilis |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/990415ap/2233.html |journal=American family physician |volume=59 |issue=8 |pages=2233-40, 2245-6 |year=1999 |pmid=10221308}}</ref> Campbell described this as "a thoroughly irresponsible statement which could mislead an unfortunate layman into refusing orthodox treatment".<ref name = "minimum-67-4"/> 

Originally Hahnemann presented only three miasms, of which the most important was "psora" ([[Greek language|Greek]] for ''itch''), described as being related to any itching diseases of the skin, supposed to be derived from suppressed scabies, and claimed to be the foundation of many further disease conditions. Hahnemann claimed psora to be the cause of such diseases as [[epilepsy]], [[cancer]], [[jaundice]], [[deafness]], and [[cataracts]].<ref name="OrganonH"/> Since Hahnemann's time, other miasms have been proposed, some replacing one or more of psora's proposed functions, including [[Tuberculosis|tubercular]] miasms and [[cancer]] miasms.<ref name=ntlworld>{{cite web|url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/homeopathy_advice/Theory/Intermediate/miasm.html |title=Miasms in homeopathy |accessdate=2007-07-24 }}</ref>

==Preparation of remedies==
[[Image:Mortar2.jpg|thumb|right|Mortar and pestle used for grinding insoluble solids into homeopathic remedies including quartz and oyster shells.]]

===Dilution and succussion===
In producing treatments for diseases, homeopaths use a process called "dynamisation" or "potentisation" whereby the remedy is diluted with alcohol or water and then vigorously shaken by ten hard strikes against an elastic body in a process called "succussion". Hahnemann thought that the use of remedies which present symptoms similar to those of disease in healthy individuals would only intensify the symptoms and exacerbate the condition, so he advocated the dilution of the remedies. During the process of potentisation, homeopaths believe that the vital energy of the diluted substance is activated and its energy released by vigorous shaking of the substance. For this purpose, Hahnemann had a saddle maker construct a special wooden striking board covered in leather on one side and stuffed with horsehair.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.igm-bosch.de/english/f10.htm |title= Online Museum |publisher=The Institute for the History of Medicine |accessdate=2007-10-22 }}</ref><ref name="Williams_2002">Williams, Nathan ([[2002]]-[[November 26|11-26]]) [http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2002/homeopathy.shtml ''Homeopathy: The Test''], [[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon (BBC)]] Retrieved on [[2007]]-[[January 26|01–26]] ([http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2002/homeopathytrans.shtml transcript])</ref>  Insoluble solids, such as [[quartz]] and [[oyster]] shell, are diluted by grinding them with [[lactose]] (''[[trituration]]'').

Three potency scales are in regular use in homeopathy. Hahnemann created the centesimal or "C scale", diluting a substance  by a factor of 100 at each stage. The centesimal scale was favored by Hahnemann for most of his life. A 2C dilution requires a substance to be diluted to one part in one hundred, and then some of that diluted solution is diluted by a further factor of one hundred. This works out to one part of the original solution mixed into 9,999 parts (100 × 100 −1 ) of the diluent.<ref>In standard chemistry, this produces a substance with a concentration of 0.01%, measured by the [[Concentration#Volume-volume_percentage|volume-volume percentage]] method.</ref>   A 6C dilution repeats this  process six times, ending up with the original material diluted by a factor of  1,000,000,000,000. (100&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;100&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;100&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;100&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;100&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;100, or 100<sup>6</sup>). Higher dilutions follow the same pattern.  In homeopathy, a solution that is more dilute is described  as having a higher ''potency''. Higher potencies (that is, more dilute substances) are considered by homeopaths to be stronger and deeper-acting remedies.

Hahnemann advocated 30C dilutions for most purposes (that is, dilution by a factor of 10<sup>60</sup>).<ref name = "Hahnemann-128">Hahnemann, ''Organon of medicine,'' aphorism 128 [http://homeoint.org/books/hahorgan/organ120.htm#P128E6]</ref>  A popular homeopathic treatment for the [[influenza|flu]] is a 200C dilution of duck liver, marketed under the name ''[[Oscillococcinum]]''. Comparing these levels of dilution to [[Avogadro's number]], one liter of a 12C homeopathic remedy created from diluting 1 liter of 1 [[molar solution]] contains on average only about 0.602 molecules of the original substance per liter of the 12C remedy. Similarly, the chance of a single molecule of the original substance remaining in a liter of 15C remedy dose is about  one in 1.7 million, and about one in 1.7 trillion trillion trillion (10<sup>36</sup>) for a 30C solution. 

Commonly, critics of homeopathy, as well as homeopaths themselves, attempt to illustrate the dilutions involved in homeopathy with examples. Hahnemann is reported to have joked that a suitable procedure to deal with an epidemic would be to empty a bottle of poison into [[Lake Geneva]], if it could be succussed 60 times.<ref name=Bambridge>''Homeopathy Investigated'', A. D. Bambridge,  Diasozo Trust, [[Kent, England]], 1989, ISBN 0948171200</ref><ref name=Andrews>[http://www.watchman.org/na/homeopth.htm ''Homeopathy and Hinduism''], Peter Andrews, The Watchman Expositor, Vol. 7, No. 3, 1990.</ref><ref>Pouring a 1 liter bottle of poison into [[Lake Geneva]] would only result in about a 7C remedy, since Lake Geneva has a volume of about 89 cubic kilometers of water ([http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0024-3590(200209)47%3A5%3C1355%3ATMOPAI%3E2.0.CO%3B2-J ''Temporal Mapping of Phytoplankton Assemblages in Lake Geneva: Annual and Interannual Changes in Their Patterns of Succession''],  Orlane Anneville, Sami Souissi, Frederic Ibanez, Vincent Ginot, Jean Claude Druart, Nadine Angeli,

Another common illustration involves comparing homeopathic dilution to dissolving the therapeutic substance in a swimming pool.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3958/is_199904/ai_n8846565/pg_6 ''Review, critique, and guidelines for the use of herbs and homeopathy''], James Glisson, Rebecca Crawford and Shannon Street, Nurse Practitioner,  April 1999

Lial, John Hornsby, Terry McGinnis,  [[Addison-Wesley]], Copyright: 2008, Published: 01/02/2007, ISBN 0321437268</ref><ref>The description in the algebra textbook suggests that there are about 100 molecules of therapeutic material remaining in the pool after 15C dilution, which is a reasonable assumption. However, the textbook incorrectly states that to expect to consume one molecule of the original substance, a person has to imbibe 1% of the pool's volume. Unfortunately, this claim is somewhat careless about probabilities; for example, to have a 95% probability of ingesting at least one molecule of the original material, a person has to drink about 3% of the pool, or about 75 metric tons of water (assuming that after dilution, 100 molecules of the original material remain). In general, consuming a fraction ''r'' of ''N'' molecules leads to a probability of approximately 1&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''e''<sup>&minus;''nr''</sup> of consuming at least one of the ''n'' molecules of the original substance, where ''N'' is assumed to be a  large number.   A 15C dilution prepared using one liter of original substance will produce a [[Concentration#Volume-volume_percentage|volume-volume concentration]] of 10<sup>−30</sup> liters of original material per liter of diluent, or 10<sup>−27</sup> milliliters of original substance per liter of diluent. In a 2.5×10<sup>6</sup> liter pool, there is therefore 2.5 × 10<sup>−21</sup> milliliters of original material. If the original material has a [[molar mass]] of ''M'' (in [[gram]]s/[[mole]]) and a [[density]] of ''D'' (in grams/[[milliliter|ml]]), then there will be 2.5 × 10<sup>−21</sup> ''D/M'' moles of original material in the pool, or ''n=1505.535 D/M'' molecules of the original material. The textbook example assumes that ''D/M'' of the original material is about 0.0664 (for comparison, water has a value of ''D/M'' of about 0.0554).</ref><ref name=dynam>{{cite web|url=http://altmed.creighton.edu/Homeopathy/philosophy/dilution.htm|title=Dynamization and Dilution |accessdate=2007-07-24 }}</ref>

For further perspective, 1&nbsp;ml of a solution which has gone through a 30C dilution would have been diluted into a cube of water measuring  1,000,000,000,000,000,000&nbsp;metres per side, which is about 106 [[light year]]s. Thus, homeopathic remedies of standard potencies contain, almost certainly, only water (or alcohol, as well as sugar and other nontherapeutic ingredients). Homeopaths maintain that this water retains some "essential property" of the original material, because the preparation has been shaken after each dilution.<ref>{{cite book |last=Resch |first=G, |coauthors=Gutmann, V |title=Scientific Foundations of Homoeopathy |year=1987 |publisher=Barthel & Barthel Publishing}}</ref> Hahnemann believed that the dynamisation or shaking of the solution caused a "spirit-like" healing force to be released from within the substance. Even though the homeopathic remedies are often extremely diluted,  homeopaths maintain that some healing force is retained by these homeopathic preparations.<ref name="dynam"/>

Some homeopaths developed a decimal scale (D or X), diluting the substance to ten times its original volume each stage. The D or X scale dilution is therefore half that of the same value of the C scale; for example, "12X" is the same level of dilution as "6C". Hahnemann never used this scale but it was very popular throughout the 19th century and still is in Europe. This potency scale appears to have been introduced in the [[1830s]] by the American homeopath, Dr. Constantine Hering.<ref name=Dudgeon>{{cite book |last=Robert |first=Ellis Dudgeon |title=Lectures on the Theory & Practice of Homeopathy | date=1853 |location=London |pages=526–7 |url=http://books.google.com/books/pdf/Lectures_on_the_theory_and_practice_of_h.pdf?id=UKZ_lqlWPhUC&output=pdf&sig=X5aw7kl9oK-_8kXvc7022__2wVo  |format=PDF|isbn=81-7021-311-8 }}</ref> In the last ten years of his life, Hahnemann also developed a quintamillesimal (Q) or LM scale diluting the drug 1 part in 50,000 parts of diluent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.simillimum.com/education/little-library/the-works-of-great-homoeopaths/ham/article04.php |title= Hahnemann's Advanced Methods |accessdate=2007-08-04 |last=Little |first=David |work=Simillimum.com }}</ref> A given dilution on the Q scale is roughly 2.35 times its designation on the C scale. For example a remedy described as  "20Q" has about the same concentration as a "47C" remedy.<ref>If a dilution is designated as q on the Q scale, and c on the C scale, c/q=log<sub>10</sub>(50,000)/2=2.349485.</ref>

Not all homeopaths advocate extremely high dilutions. Many of the early homeopaths were originally doctors and generally tended to use lower dilutions such as "3X" or "6X", rarely going beyond "12X". The split between lower and higher dilutions followed ideological lines with the former stressing pathology and a strong link to conventional medicine, while the latter emphasised vital force, miasms and a [[spirituality|spiritual]] interpretation of disease.<ref>{{cite book |last=Edwin Wheeler |first=Charles |title=Dr. Hughes: Recollections of Some Masters of Homeopathy |publisher=Health Through Homeopathy |date=1941 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Bodman |first=Frank |title=he Richard Hughes Memorial Lecture |publisher=BHJ |date=1970 |pages=179–193 }}</ref>

==== Dilution calculation ====

'''α.''' {{Note_label|A|α|none}} '''Calculation of numbers of molecules in dilutions'''
:Number of [[Mole (unit)|moles]] in initial solution = concentration ([[Concentration#Molarity|M]]) x volume ([[litre|L]])

Also
:Number of molecules in initial solution = number of moles x [[Avogadro's constant]]

Therefore, for 1 L of a 1 M solution
:Moles = 1 × 1 = 1 mole
:Molecules = 1 × 6.02×10<sup>23</sup> = 6.02×10<sup>23</sup> molecules

The 10-fold dilution required to reduce the number of molecules to less than one per litre is 1 part in 1×10<sup>24</sup> (24X or 12C) since:
:6.02×10<sup>23</sup>/1×10<sup>24</sup> = 0.6 molecules per litre

====Coverage in the mainstream press====   
The [[BBC]]'s [[Horizon (BBC TV series)|''Horizon'']] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] ''[[20/20]]'' broadcast programs described scientific testing of homeopathic dilutions that were unable to differentiate these dilutions from [[water]].<ref name="Williams_2002"/><ref name="Stossel">{{cite news | last = Stossel | first = John | authorlink=John Stossel|title = ''Homeopathic Remedies – Can Water Really Remember? | work = [[20/20]] | language = English | publisher = ABC News | year = 2008 | url = http://abcnews.go.com/print?id=124309 | accessdate = 2008-01-22}}</ref>

===Provings===
In order to determine which specific remedies could be used to treat which diseases, [[Samuel Hahnemann|Hahnemann]] experimented on himself and others for several years, before using remedies on patients. His experiments did not initially consist of giving remedies to the sick, because he thought that the most similar remedy, by virtue of its ability to induce symptoms similar to the disease itself, would make it impossible to determine which symptoms came from the remedy and which from the disease itself. Therefore, sick people were excluded from these experiments. The method used for determining which remedies were suitable for specific diseases was called "proving", after the original [[German language|German]] word "Prüfung", meaning "test".) A homeopathic proving is the method by which the [[Profile (engineering)|profile]] of a [[homeopathic remedy]] is determined.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dantas F, Fisher P, Walach H, ''et al'' |title=A systematic review of the quality of homeopathic pathogenetic trials published from 1945 to 1995 |journal=Homeopathy : the journal of the Faculty of Homeopathy |volume=96 |issue=1 |pages=4–16 |year=2007 |pmid=17227742}}</ref>

During the process of proving, Hahnemann used healthy volunteers who were given remedies, often in molecular doses, although he later advocated proving with remedies at a 30C dilution,<ref name = "Hahnemann-128"/> and the resulting symptoms were compiled by observers into a "Drug Picture". During the process the volunteers were observed for months at a time and were made to keep extensive journals detailing all of their symptoms at specific times during the day. During the tests volunteers were forbidden from consuming coffee, tea, spices, or wine. They were also not allowed to play chess, because Hahnemann considered it to be "too exciting", though they were allowed to drink beer and were encouraged to moderately exercise. After the experiments were over, Hahnemann made the volunteers offer their hands and take an oath swearing that what they reported in their journals was the truth, at which time he would interrogate them extensively concerning their symptoms.

Provings have been described as important in the development of the [[clinical trial]], due to their early use of simple control groups, systematic and quantitative procedures, and some of the first application of statistics in medicine.<ref>{{cite book |last =Cassedy |first=James H. |title=American Medicine and Statistical Thinking, [[1800]]–1860 |publisher=iUniverse |date=June 1999 |isbn = 978-1583484289 }}</ref> The lengthy records of self-experimentation by homeopaths have occasionally proven useful in the development of modern drugs: For example,  evidence [[nitroglycerin]] might be useful as a treatment for [[angina pectoris|angina]] was discovered by looking through homeopathic provings, though homeopaths themselves never used it for that purpose at that time.<ref name="pmid2866851">{{cite journal |author=Fye WB |title=Nitroglycerin: a homeopathic remedy |journal=Circulation |volume=73 |issue=1 |pages=21–9 |year=1986 |pmid=2866851 |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/reprint/73/1/21.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>
The first recorded provings were published by Hahnemann in his 1796 ''Essay on a New Principle''. His ''Fragmenta de viribus'' (1805)<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.homeorizon.com/mainpagegeneral.asp?t=fragmenta.htm |title=''Fragmenta de Viribus Medicamentorum Positivis Sive in sano Corpore Humano Observatis''|accessdate=2007-10-16 |first=Homeorizon Team }}</ref> contained the results of 27 provings, and his 1810 ''[[Materia Medica Pura]]'' contained 65.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.hpathy.com/materiamedica/hahnemann-materia-pura/index.asp |title=Materia Medica Pura |accessdate=2007-10-16 |last=Hahnemann |first=Samuel |publisher=hpathy.com }}</ref> 217 remedies underwent provings for [[James Tyler Kent]]'s 1905 ''Lectures on Homoeopathic Materia Medica'', and newer substances are continually added to contemporary versions.

===Repertory===
[[Image:Rep1.JPG|thumb|Homeopathic repertory by James Tyler Kent.]]

A compilation of reports of many homeopathic provings is known as a ''homeopathic materia medica''. In practice the usefulness of such a compilation is limited because a practitioner does not need to look up the symptoms for a particular remedy, but rather to explore the remedies for a particular symptom. This need is filled by the ''homeopathic repertory'', which is an index of symptoms, listing after each symptom those remedies that are associated with it. Repertories are often very extensive and may include data from clinical experience in addition to provings. There is often lively debate among the compilers of a repertory and interested practitioners over the veracity of a particular inclusion. The first symptomatic index of the homeopathic materia medica was arranged by Hahnemann. Soon after, one of his students [[Clemens Maria Franz von Bönninghausen|Clemens von Bönninghausen]], created the ''Therapautic Pocket Book'', another homeopathic repertory.<ref>{{cite book |last=von Bönninghausen |first=Clemens |coauthors=Bradford TL, Boger, CM. |title=Boenninghausen's Characteristics and Repertory with Word Index |year=1999, Reprint Ed. |publisher=New Delhi : B. Jain |isbn=8-170-21207-3 }}</ref> The first such Homeopathic Repertory was Dr. George Jahr's Repertory, published in 1835 in [[German language|German]] and then again in 1838 in English and edited by Dr. Constantine Hering. This version was less focused on disease categories and would be the forerunner to Kent's later works.<ref name=Bellavite>{{cite journal |author=Bellavite P, Conforti A, Piasere V, Ortolani R |title=Immunology and homeopathy. 1. Historical background |journal=Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=441–52 |year=2005 |pmid=16322800 |url=http://ecam.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/2/4/441}}</ref> It consisted of three large volumes. Such repertories increased in size and detail as time progressed.

==Treatments==
Homeopathic treatments generally begin with detailed examinations of their patients' histories, including questions regarding their physical, mental and emotional states, their life circumstances and any physical/emotional illnesses. The homeopath then translates this information into a complex formula of mental and physical symptoms, including likes, dislikes, innate predispositions and even body type.<ref name=Stehlin>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/096_home.html |title=Homeopathy: Real Medicine or Empty Promises? |accessdate=2007-10-01 |last=Stehlin |first=Isadora |date=1996-12-XX |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration]] }}</ref> The goal is to develop a comprehensive representation of each individual's overall health. This information can then be compared with similar established data in the drug provings found in the homeopathic materia medica. Assisted by further dialogues with the patient, the homeopath then aims to find the one drug most closely matching the "symptom totality" of the patient. There are many methods for determining the most-similar remedy (the ''simillimum''), and homeopaths sometimes disagree. This is partly due to the complexity of the "totality of symptoms" concept. That is, homeopaths do not use all symptoms, but decide which are the most characteristic. This subjective evaluation of case analysis relies on knowledge and experience of the homeopath doing the diagnosis.

Some diversity in approaches to treatments exists among homeopaths. So called "classical" homeopathy generally involves detailed examinations of a patient's history and infrequent doses of a single remedy as the patient is monitored for improvements in symptoms. While "clinical" homeopathy involves combinations of remedies to address the various symptoms of an illness.<ref name=pmid12614092/>

"Remedy" is a technical term used in homeopathy to refer to a substance prepared with a particular procedure and intended for treating patients. Homeopathic practitioners rely on two types of reference when prescribing remedies. The Homeopathic Materia Medicae which is comprised of alphabetical indexes of "drug pictures" organised by remedy and describe the symptom patterns associated with individual remedies. They also rely on homeopathic repertories which consist of indexes of symptoms of diseases and listing remedies associated with specific symptoms.<ref name=elixris>{{cite web |url=http://www.elixirs.com/medica.htm |title=Materia Medica: Remedy Information |accessdate=2007-07-24 |last=Jones |first=Kathryn }}</ref>

Homeopathy uses many animal, plant, mineral, and synthetic substances in its remedies.

===Isopathy===
Isopathy is a therapy derived from homeopathy and was invented by Johann Joseph Wilhelm Lux in the 1830s.<ref name=Bellavite/> Isopathy differs from homeopathy in general in that the remedies are made up either from things that cause the [[disease]], or from products of the disease, such as [[pus]]. Many so-called "homeopathic vaccines" are a form of isopathy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.homeoinfo.com/08_non-classical_topics/is_it_homeopathy/isopathy.php |title=Isopathy |accessdate=2007-07-25 }}</ref>

===Tautopathy===
Tautopathy is a practice of [[alternative medicine]] that is similar to homeopathy in that it uses very diluted substances to treat illness. However, tautopathy does not rely on the "law of similars", as homeopathy does. According to practitioners of Tautopathy, dilute solutions of lead and arsenic can cause the body to secrete excess amounts of these toxic metals.<ref>[http://www.hpathy.com/tautopathy/tautopathy.asp ''Tautopathy – An Introduction''], Manish Bhatia, Tautopathy, [http://www.hpathy.com/ Homeopathy for Everyone: Everything Homeopathic!]</ref>

===Flower remedies===
Flower remedies are produced by placing flowers in water and exposing them to sunlight. The most famous of these are the [[Bach flower remedies]], which were developed by the homeopath [[Edward Bach]]. The relationship between these remedies and homeopathy is controversial. On the one hand, the proponents of these remedies share homeopathy's vitalist world-view and the remedies are claimed to act through the same hypothetical "vital force". However, although many of the same plants are used as in homeopathy, the method of preparation is somewhat different, with Bach flower therapies supposedly being prepared in "gentler" ways, such as placing flowers in bowls of sunlit water, and so on.<ref>{{cite journal |author=van Haselen RA |title=The relationship between homeopathy and the Dr Bach system of flower remedies: a critical appraisal |journal=The British homoeopathic journal |volume=88 |issue=3 |pages=121–7 |year=1999 |pmid=10449052}}</ref> There is no convincing scientific or clinical evidence for flower remedies being effective.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ernst E |title="Flower remedies": a systematic review of the clinical evidence |journal=Wien.

===Veterinary use===
The idea of using homeopathy as a treatment for other animals, termed ''veterinary homeopathy'', dates back to the inception of homeopathy as Hahnemann himself wrote and spoke of the use of homeopathy in animals other than humans.<ref name=Saxton2007>{{cite journal

Animals may only be treated by qualified veterinary surgeons in the UK and some other countries. Internationally, the body that supports and represents homeopathic veterinarians is the [[International Association for Veterinary Homeopathy]]. The use of homeopathy in veterinary medicine is controversial, as there has been little scientific investigation and current research in the field is not of a high enough standard to provide reliable data.<ref name=Hektoen>{{cite journal |author=Hektoen L |title=Review of the current involvement of homeopathy in veterinary practice and research |journal=Vet.

== Medical and scientific analysis ==

Homeopathy is unsupported by modern scientific research. The extreme dilutions used in homeopathic preparations usually leave none of the active ingredient ([[atoms]], [[ions]] or [[molecules]]) in the final product.<ref name=Teixeira>{{cite journal |author=Teixeira J |title=Can water possibly have a memory?

Critics also contend that homeopathy is inherently dangerous, because homeopaths offer a false hope that may discourage or delay proper treatment.

=== High dilutions ===

The extremely high dilutions in homeopathy have been a main point of criticism. Homeopaths believe that the methodical dilution of a substance, beginning with a 10% or lower solution and working downwards, with shaking after each dilution, produces a therapeutically active "remedy", in contrast to therapeutically inert water. However, homeopathic remedies are usually diluted to the point where there are no molecules from the original solution left in a dose of the final remedy.<ref name=Milgrom>{{cite journal |author=Milgrom LR |title=Conspicuous by its absence: the Memory of Water, macro-entanglement, and the possibility of homeopathy |journal=Homeopathy : the journal of the Faculty of Homeopathy |volume=96 |issue=3 |pages=209–19 |year=2007 |pmid=17678819 |doi=10.1016/j.homp.2007.05.002}}</ref> Since even the longest-lived [[Noncovalent bonding|noncovalent]] structures in liquid water at room temperature are only stable for a few [[picosecond]]s,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Teixeira1 J, Luzar A, Longeville S. |title=Dynamics of hydrogen bonds: how to probe their role in the unusual properties of liquid water |journal=J.

Homeopathy contends that higher dilutions (fewer potential molecules in each dose) result in stronger medicinal effects. This idea is inconsistent with the observed [[dose-response relationship]]s of conventional drugs, where the effects are dependent on the concentration of the active ingredient in the body.<ref name=Levy>{{cite journal |author=Levy G |title=Kinetics of drug action: an overview |journal=J.

=== Research on medical effectiveness ===

[[Image:Hepar.jpg|thumb|Old bottle of ''Hepar sulph'' made from [[calcium sulfide]]]]
The medical effectiveness of homeopathy has been a point of contention since its inception, and researchers have subjected the system to close scrutiny. One of the earliest studies concerning homeopathic medicine was sponsored by the British government during World War II in which volunteers tested the effectiveness of homeopathic remedies against diluted mustard gas burns.<ref name="Mustard">{{citejournal|publisher=British Homoeopathic Society |journal=British Homoeopathic Journal|year=1943|title= Report on mustard gas experiments |pages= 1–12|volume=33|url=http://www.jameslindlibrary.org/trial_records/20th_Century/1940s/brit_homeo_soc/brit_homeo_soc_kp.html}}</ref> More recent controlled clinical trials on homeopathy have shown poor results, showing slight-to-no differences between homeopathic remedies and placebo.<ref name=nccamnih>{{cite web |url=http://nccam.nih.gov/health/homeopathy/ |title=Questions and Answers About Homeopathy [NCCAM Research Report] |accessdate=2008-02-08 |format= |work=}}</ref> 

[[meta-analysis|Meta-analyses]], which analyse large groups of studies and draw conclusions based on the results as a whole, have been used to evaluate the effectiveness of homeopathy. Early meta-analyses investigating homeopathic remedies showed slightly positive results among the studies examined, but such studies have warned that it was impossible to draw firm conclusions due to low methodological quality and difficulty in controlling for [[publication bias]] in the studies reviewed.<ref name="pmid1825800">{{cite journal |author=Kleijnen J, Knipschild P, ter Riet G |title=Clinical trials of homoeopathy |journal=BMJ |volume=302 |issue=6772 |pages=316–323 |year=1991 |pmid=1825800 }}</ref><ref name="pmid11416076"/><ref name=pmid9310601>{{cite journal |author=Linde K, Clausius N, Ramirez G, ''et al'' |title=Are the clinical effects of homeopathy placebo effects?

The fact that a number of the new high-quality trials... have negative results, and a recent update of our review for the most “original” subtype of homeopathy (classical or individualized homeopathy), seem to confirm the finding that more rigorous trials have less-promising results.

A recent meta-analysis of clinical trials on the effectiveness of homeopathy has shown that earlier clinical trials showed signs of major weakness in methodology and reporting, and that homeopathy trials were less randomized and reported less on dropouts than other types of trials.<ref name="pmid11416076">{{cite journal |author=Linde K, Jonas WB, Melchart D, Willich S |title=The methodological quality of randomized controlled trials of homeopathy, herbal medicines and acupuncture |journal=International journal of epidemiology |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=526–531 |year=2001 |pmid=11416076 }}</ref>

Clinical studies of the medical efficacy of homeopathy have been criticised by some homeopaths as being irrelevant because they do not test "classical homeopathy".<ref>[http://www.vithoulkas.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=247&Itemid=9 Another point of view for the homeopathic trials and meta-analyses] by [[George Vithoulkas]]</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4183916.stm Homoeopathy's benefit questioned] from [[BBC]] News web site</ref> There have, however, been a number of clinical trials that have tested individualized homeopathy.

found 32 trials that met their inclusion criteria, 19 of which were placebo-controlled and provided enough data for meta-analysis. These 19 studies showed a pooled odds ratio of 1.17 to 2.23 in favor of individualized homeopathy over the placebo, but no difference was seen when the analysis was restricted to the methodologically best trials. The authors concluded "that the results of the available randomized trials suggest that individualized homeopathy has an effect over placebo. The evidence, however, is not convincing because of methodological shortcomings and inconsistencies."

Dr. Jack Killen, acting deputy director of the [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]], says homeopathy "goes beyond current understanding of chemistry and physics".

In 1987, French immunologist [[Jacques Benveniste]] submitted a paper to the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' while working at [[INSERM]]. The paper purported to have discovered that [[basophils]] released [[histamine]] when exposed to a homeopathic dilution of anti-immunoglobulin E, a type of [[white blood cell]]. The journal editors, sceptical of the results, requested that the study be replicated in a separate laboratory. Upon replication in four separate laboratories the study was published. Still sceptical of the findings, ''Nature'' assembled an independent investigative team to determine the accuracy of the research, consisting of ''Nature'' editor and physicist Sir [[John Maddox]], American scientific fraud investigator and chemist Walter Stewart, and sceptic and magician [[James Randi]]. After investigating the findings and methodology of the experiment, the team found that the experiments were "statistically ill-controlled", "interpretation has been clouded by the exclusion of measurements in conflict with the claim", and concluded, "We believe that experimental data have been uncritically assessed and their imperfections inadequately reported."<ref>{{cite journal |last=Maddox |first=John |authorlink=John Maddox |coauthors=James Randi and Walter W.

=== Ethical and safety issues ===

As homeopathic remedies usually contain only water and/or alcohol, they are thought to be generally safe. Only in rare cases are the original ingredients present at detectable levels. In one such case, an unusually undiluted (1:100 or "2X") solution of [[zinc gluconate]], marketed as [[Zinc gluconate#Safety Concerns|Zicam Nasal Spray]], allegedly caused a small percentage of users to lose their sense of smell.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.homeowatch.org/legal/zicam.html |title=Zicam Marketers Sued |accessdate=2007-10-25 |publisher=Homeowatch.org }}</ref> There were 340 cases settled out of court for {{nowrap|12 million U.S. dollars}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/30/AR2006013001240.html |title=Paying through the Nose |accessdate=2007-10-25 |last=Boodman |first=Sandra |date=January 31, 2006 |publisher=[[Washington Post]]}}</ref>

Critics of homeopathy have cited other concerns over homeopathic remedies, most seriously, cases of patients of homeopathy failing to receive proper treatment for diseases that it is claimed could have been diagnosed or cured with conventional medicine. Several surveys demonstrate that some (particularly non-physician) homeopaths advise their patients against [[vaccine|immunisation]].<ref name="pmid9243229">{{cite journal |author=Ernst E |title=The attitude against immunisation within some branches of complementary medicine |journal=Eur.

While Hahnemann was opposed to such preparations, modern homeopaths often use them and there is no evidence to indicate they have any beneficial effects.<ref>{{cite journal |title=A challenge to the credibility of homeopathy |journal=Am.

In 1978, [[Anthony Campbell]], then a consultant physician at The Royal London Homeopathic Hospital, criticised statements made by [[George Vithoulkas]] to promote his homeopathic treatments. Vithoulkas stated that [[syphilis]], when treated with antibiotics, would develop into secondary and tertiary syphilis with involvement of the [[central nervous system]]. Campbell described this as a thoroughly irresponsible statement which could mislead an unfortunate layman into refusing conventional medical treatment.<ref name = "minimum-67-4"/> This claim echoes the idea that treating a disease with external medication used to treat the symptoms would only drive it deeper into the body and conflicts with scientific studies, which indicate that penicillin treatment produces a complete cure of syphilis in more than 90% of cases.<ref name="Birnbaum"/>

A 2006 review by W. Steven Pray of the College of Pharmacy at [[Southwestern Oklahoma State University]] recommends that pharmacy colleges include a required course in unproven medications and therapies, that ethical dilemmas inherent in recommending products lacking proven safety and efficacy data be discussed, and that students should be taught where unproven systems such as homeopathy depart from evidence-based medicine.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pray WS |title=Ethical, scientific, and educational concerns with unproven medications |journal=American journal of pharmaceutical education |volume=70 |issue=6 |pages=141 |year=2006 |pmid=17332867 |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=17332867}}</ref>

==Prevalence and legal trends==
{{main|Regulation and prevalence of homeopathy}}
[[Image:WomanHomeopathy.jpg|thumb|Woman looking at homeopathic remedies]]

Homeopathic medicine is fairly common in some countries while being uncommon in others; is highly regulated in some countries and mostly unregulated in others. Regulations vary in Europe depending on the country. In some countries, there are no specific legal regulations concerning the use of homeopathy, while in others, licenses or degrees in conventional medicine from accredited universities are required. In [[Austria]] and [[Germany]], no specific regulations exist, while [[France]] and [[Denmark]] mandate licenses to diagnose any illness or dispense of any product whose purpose is to treat any illness.<ref name=WHO>{{cite web |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2001/WHO_EDM_TRM_2001.2.pdf |title=Legal Status of Traditional Medicine and Complementary/Alternative Medicine: A Worldwide Review |accessdate=2007-09-12 |date=2001 |format=PDF |work=World Health Organization |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] }}</ref> Some homeopathic treatment is covered by the public health service of several European countries, including France, the [[United Kingdom]], Denmark, and [[Luxembourg]]. In other countries, such as [[Belgium]], homeopathy is not covered. In [[Austria]], the public health service requires scientific proof of effectiveness in order to reimburse medical treatments, but exceptions are made for homeopathy.<ref name="WHO"/> Two countries which formerly offered homeopathy under their public health services have withdrawn this privilege. At the start of 2004, homeopathic medications, with some exceptions, were no longer covered by the German public health service, and in June 2005, the [[Swiss]] Government, after a 5-year trial, withdrew homeopathy and four other complementary treatments, stating that they did not meet efficacy and cost-effectiveness criteria, though insurance can be bought to cover such treatments provided by a medical doctor.<ref>[http://www.kaufmann-net.ch/ Bundesratsentscheid über die Leistungen für Alternativmedizin: Information about Homeopathy in [[Switzerland]] by Vera Kaufmann, BHSc.Hom.] (in German)</ref>
