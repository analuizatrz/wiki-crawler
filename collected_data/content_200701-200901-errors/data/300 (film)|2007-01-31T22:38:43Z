== Production ==
In May 2003, the project was being produced by Gianni Nunnari and Mark Canton, whilst Michael B. Gordon had completed a second draft of ''300'' that was 121 pages long.<ref name="review">{{ cite news | author=Stax | url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/492/492542p1.html | title=The Stax Report: Script Review of ''300'' | publisher=[[IGN]] | date=[[2004-02-17]] | accessdate=2006-10-29 }}</ref> In June 2004, director [[Zack Snyder]] (''[[Dawn of the Dead (2004 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'') was hired to helm the film.<ref name="commands">{{ cite news | author=Stax | url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/525/525357p1.html | title=Who Commands the ''300''? | publisher=[[IGN]] | date=[[2004-06-22]] | accessdate=2006-10-29 }}</ref> Snyder, with the help of screenwriter Kurt Johnstad, worked to rewrite Gordon's script for production.<ref name="commands" /> [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], the author of ''300'', was also attached to the project as executive producer and consultant.<ref>{{ cite news | first=Todd | last=Gilchrist | url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/643/643905p2.html | title=Being Frank | publisher=[[IGN]] | date=[[2005-08-20]] | accessdate=2006-10-29 }}</ref>  

The film is a shot-for-shot adaptation of the comic book, similar to the film adaptation of ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]''.<ref name="attila" />  Snyder said that he had photocopied panels from Frank Miller's comic book and worked to plan out the shots that would lead up to the moment and the shots to get out of it after.  "It was a fun process for me to kind of have to go, to have a goal, to have a frame as a goal to get to," said Snyder.  The director also worked to craft the film style to be similar to the comic book.<ref>{{ cite news | url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=0&id=37328 | title=''300'' Matches Miller Style | publisher=[[Sci Fi Wire]] | date=[[2006-07-27]] | accessdate=2006-10-29 }}</ref> Numerous images and pieces of dialogue are taken frame for frame from Miller.<ref>{{cite web| title = '300' comic to screen| publisher = Solace in Cinema| url = http://www.solaceincinema.com/2006/10/04/300-comic-to-screen-comparison/| accessdate = 2006-11-16}}</ref>  One exception to the direct adaptation was using the character Dilios to narrate the story.  Dilios was used by Snyder to show the audience that the surreal "Frank Miller world" of ''300'' was through the perspective of Dilios taking artistic license in his storytelling about the Battle of Thermopylae.<ref>{{ cite news | first=Resa | last=Nelson | url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=0&id=34442 | title=''300'' Mixes History, Fantasy | publisher=[[Sci Fi Wire]] | date=[[2006-02-01]] | accessdate=2006-10-29 }}</ref>

The film spent two months of pre-production in creating 125 shields, 250 spears and 75 swords, although some were recycled from ''[[Troy (film)|Troy]]'' and ''[[Alexander (film)|Alexander]]''. The actors trained alongside the stuntmen, and even Snyder joined in. 600-700 costumes were created for the film, as well as extensive prosthetics for various characters and the corpses of Persian soldiers.<ref name="SHH set visit">{{cite news | last = Douglas | first = Edward | title = ''300'': The Set Visit! | publisher = SuperHeroHype! | date = [[2007-01-05]] | url = http://www.superherohype.com/news/300news.php?id=5064 | accessdate = 2007-01-08}}</ref>

[[Gerard Butler]] said that he didn't feel constrained as an actor by Snyder's direction of the film, however saying, "If you are performing in a way that's trying to be so truthful to the comic, then, of course, there are certain freedoms that are limited to the way that you perform."  David Wenham said there were times where Snyder wanted to capture iconic moments from the comic book specifically and times where the director gave actors "absolute freedom and liberty to explore within the world and the confines that had been set".<ref>{{ cite news | first=Patrick | last=Lee | url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=0&id=37249 | title=Butler Not Too Chafed By ''300'' | publisher=[[Sci Fi Wire]] | date=[[2006-07-23]] | accessdate=2006-10-29 }}</ref> [[Lena Headey]] said of her experience with the bluescreens, "You can't sort of relate to any world, so it's very odd, and emotionally, there's nothing to connect to apart from another actor."<ref>{{ cite news | first=Edward | last=Douglas | url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/featuresnews.php?id=3785 | title=300's Queen Gorgo | publisher=SuperHeroHype.com | date=[[2006-01-19]] | accessdate=2006-10-29 }}</ref> The only scene shot outdoors is a shot of horses travelling across the countryside.<ref>{{cite news | last = Olsen | first = Mark | title = An epic battle is pumped up | publisher = LA Times | date = [[2007-01-14]] | url = http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/cl-ca-spartans14jan14,0,925494.story?coll=cl-movies | accessdate = 2007-01-14}}</ref>

In post-production Snyder enlisted the assistance of Montreal's Meteor Studios to work on 250 visual effects shots to fill in the film footage of [[bluescreen|bluescreens]] and near-empty film sets. James Price, Meteor's visual effects supervisor, said the team of 70 Meteor artists manipulated the colors in ''300'' by increasing the color contrasts of light and dark colors, and certain film sequences were de-saturated and tinted to establish different moods for the scenes.  Ghislain St-Pierre, Meteor's GM, described the look, "Everything looks realistic, but it has a kind of a gritty illustrative feel."  The team worked on creating visual effects shots for scenes including a battle between Spartans and [[ Persian_Immortals | Immortals]] (elite Persian soldiers) and an expansion of the city of Sparta.<ref>{{cite news | first=Sean | last=Davidson | url=http://www.playbackmag.com/articles/magazine/20060306/meteor.html | title=Meteor hits 300 | publisher=Playback | date=[[2006-03-06]] | accessdate=2006-10-29 }}</ref> Chris Watts and Jim Bissell created "The Crush" which filtered colours to look like Miller's novel, meaning props were painted differently on set due to the eventual process. As well as digital effects, the crew also created an animatronic wolf and 13 animatronic horses.<ref name="SHH set visit" />

==Soundtrack==
In July 2005, composer [[Tyler Bates]] had begun work on the film, describing the score as having "beautiful themes on the top and large choir", but "tempered with some extreme heaviness". The composer had scored for a test shot that the director wanted to show to Warner Bros. to illustrate the path of the project. Bates said that the score had "a lot of weight and intensity in the low end of the percussion" that Snyder found agreeable to the film.<ref>{{cite news | first=Daniel Robert | last=Epstein | url=http://www.ugo.com/channels/music/features/tylerbates_music/interview.asp | title=Exclusive Interview with Tyler Bates, Score Composer for ''The Devil's Rejects'' | publisher=UGO.com | date=[[2005-07-13]] | accessdate=2006-10-29 }}</ref> The score was recorded at [[Abbey Road Studios]] and features the vocals of [[Azam Ali]].<ref>{{cite news | author=Warner Bros.

At [[Comic-Con International]] 2006 in July, the ''300'' panel showed a preview of the film.
