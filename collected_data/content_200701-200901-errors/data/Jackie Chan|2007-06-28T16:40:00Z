==Acting career==
[[Image:DrunkenMaster DVDcover.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Drunken Master]]'' brought Jackie Chan into the mainstream.]]
===Early exploits: 1976-1980===
Having returned to Hong Kong, Chan joined film director [[Lo Wei]], who planned to model him on Bruce Lee, casting him in the 1976 movie ''[[New Fist of Fury]]''. Chan's stage name was changed to "Shing Lung" ([[Chinese character|Chinese:]] 成龍, literally "become a dragon") to emphasise his similarity to Bruce Lee, whose Chinese name was "Lee Siu Lung" ([[Chinese character|Chinese:]] 李小龍). The film was not a success as Chan's Peking Opera style differed from Bruce Lee's martial arts style. In spite of the film's failure, Lo Wei insisted on producing films with similar themes, resulting in little improvement at the box office.<ref name="FightingMaster">{{cite web

  | format =
  | doi =
  | accessdate = 2007-06-07 }}</ref>
Between 1976 and 1978, the Lo Wei Motion Picture Company produced several further films featuring Chan, ''[[Shaolin Chamber of Death]]'', ''[[Killer Meteors]]'' (alongside [[Jimmy Wang Yu]]) ''To Kill with Intrigue'' and ''[[Magnificent Bodyguards]]''. During this period, Chan also appeared in smaller roles in several other films, including a supporting role in the [[Golden Harvest]] release, ''[[Hand Of Death]]'', an early film from director [[John Woo]].

Chan's major breakthrough was the 1978 film ''[[Snake in the Eagle's Shadow]]'', directed by [[Yuen Woo Ping]], who granted Chan complete control over his own techniques, hence establishing a new genre of comedic kung fu. The shooting of the film had its dangers, with one of Chan's teeth accidentally kicked out by fellow actor, [[Hwang Jang Lee]]. When released, The movie proved to be a breath of fresh air for the Hong Kong audience and was well received.<ref>{{cite web

The final film Chan completed with Lo's studio was ''[[Dragon Fist]]'' in 1979. During the shooting of ''[[The Fearless Hyena Part II]]'' Chan broke his contract and joined [[Golden Harvest]], prompting [[Lo Wei]] to hire [[triad]]s to blackmail Chan. The dispute was resolved with the help of the actor and director, [[Jimmy Wang Yu]]. Chan was able to stay with Golden Harvest, and directed his second film ''[[The Young Master]]'' in 1980.<ref name="Jcm">{{cite web

===Success of the comedy kung-fu genre: 1980s===
The 1980s saw Jackie Chan move away from the traditional [[period piece|period]] kung fu films to films set in a more modern era, with more spectacular stunts. The decade also saw Chan's early forays into the [[American film industry]], beginning in 1980, albeit with little success. His first Hollywood movie was ''[[Battle Creek Brawl]]'', directed by [[Robert Clouse]], director of Bruce Lee's ''[[Enter the Dragon]]''. In addition, Chan played a minor role in ''[[The Cannonball Run (film)|The Cannonball Run]]'' (1981), a successful film that grossed [[United States dollar|US$]]100 million worldwide. In spite of being largely ignored in favour of established American actors like [[Burt Reynolds]], Chan was impressed by the [[outtakes]] shown at the closing credits, inspiring him to use the same technique in his future films.<ref name=FightingMaster/> 

After the commercial failure of ''[[The Protector (1985 film)|The Protector]]'', Chan temporarily abandoned his attempts to break into the US market, returning his focus to local films. He began the ''[[Police Story (film)|Police Story]]'' series soon after his return from the United States with the [[Police Story (film)|first film]] released in 1985. The film was a Hong Kong style action-comedy with American influences, and is still considered one of Chan's best films. As in his previous films, all of the dangerous stuntwork was done by Chan himself.<ref>{{cite web

Between 1983 and 1985, Chan enjoyed his most prolific period of acting alongside his opera school brothers, co-starring with Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao in Chan's ''[[Project A]]'', playing the role of a coastguard in pursuit of a pirate.

[[Image:Rumble In The Bronx.jpg|thumb|right|Chan in his [[Hollywood]] breakthrough film ''[[Rumble in the Bronx]]'']]
In the 1990s, Chan regained his Hollywood ambitions. Early on, he refused two offers to play villains to avoid being [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]] for future roles. When [[Sylvester Stallone]] offered him the role of Simon Phoenix, a criminal in the futuristic film ''[[Demolition Man (film)|Demolition Man]]'', he declined and it was taken by [[Wesley Snipes]].<ref>{{cite web

Chan is well known for performing the majority of his own stunts, which he choreographs along with his stunt team.

==Roles played==
{{see|Jackie Chan filmography}}
Jackie Chan originally created his screen persona as a reaction to that of the martial artist [[Bruce Lee]], and the [[Bruceploitation|numerous imitators]] who appeared before and after Lee's death. In contrast to Bruce Lee's characters, who were typically stern, morally upright heroes, Chan plays well-meaning, slightly foolish regular guys often at the mercy of friends, girlfriends or families who always triumph in the end regardless.<ref name=Iamjc/>

In recent years, Chan grew tired of being typecast as an action hero, prompting him to act with more emotions in his latest films. In ''[[New Police Story]]'', he portrayed a character suffering from alcoholism and mourning his murdered colleagues.<ref name="Nps">{{cite video
