'''Bradford "Brad" Rutter''' (born [[January 31]], [[1978]]) is a [[Pennsylvania]] quiz show host, most widely known as a contestant on the U.S. [[Television syndication|syndicated]] [[game show]] ''[[Jeopardy!]]''. As of 2007, he has won more money on a game show than any other person in history.

Rutter became an undefeated five-time champion on ''Jeopardy!'' in 2000 and has since won an unprecedented three ''Jeopardy!'' tournament titles: the 2001 [[Jeopardy! Tournament of Champions|Tournament of Champions]], the [[Jeopardy! Million Dollar Masters|Million Dollar Masters Tournament]], and the [[Jeopardy! Ultimate Tournament of Champions|Ultimate Tournament of Champions]].  In the finals of the Ultimate Tournament, Rutter decisively defeated [[Ken Jennings]] and [[Jerome Vered]] to become the show's biggest money winner to date, with a total earnings of $3,255,102.

In twenty games, Rutter has never lost a full match of ''Jeopardy!''  (Rutter has trailed at the end of the first game of a two-day match twice&mdash;against Rick Knutsen in the first game of the Finals of the 2001 Tournament of Champions, and against John Cuthbertson in the first game of the semifinals of the Ultimate Tournament of Champions&mdash;but he ultimately won both of those matches with a higher two-day cumulative score.)  Given his unequaled records and crushing victories over otherwise highly successful ''Jeopardy!'' champions (such as [[Ken Jennings|Jennings]], [[Jerome Vered|Vered]], Eric Newhouse, Bob Verini, Doug Lach, Tad Carithers, John Beck, and Chris Miller), Rutter is one of the best ''Jeopardy!'' players of the Trebek era.

Rutter's machine-like buzzer timing using the ''Jeopardy!'' signaling device spawned the term "getting Ruttered."

Rutter currently lives in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]], where he hosts ''[http://www.inquizitive.com/ InQuizitive]'', a locally-broadcasted quiz show for [[high school]] students.  As of 2005, ''InQuizitive'' is in its second season.  He is also currently a reader and judge for the high school [[National Academic Championship]].

Rutter is a 1995 graduate of Manheim Township High School in [[Neffsville, Pennsylvania]], where he was on the [[Quiz Bowl]] team.  He was named to the [[National Academic Championship]] Hall of Fame, being one of 18 people named to it in its 25 year history.  At the 2005 Manheim Township High School graduation ceremony, he announced the start of a scholarship fund in memory of his late high school quiz bowl coach.  

Rutter has self-deprecatingly described himself as a "slacker" in high school and a [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]] dropout (while there, he studied [[English studies|English]] and [[History]]).  Prior to his success on ''Jeopardy!'', he worked at the [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]] [[Trans World Entertainment|Coconuts record store]].  

He appeared on the U.S. game show ''[[1 vs. 100]]'' (as a member of "the Mob") on December 1, 2006 and again on December 8, 2006 correctly answering every question and being one of only 7 mob members to survive and go on to the next show, along with [[Annie Duke]]. He would eventually be eliminated on the December 15th episode, on a question about Jewish reggae musician [[Matisyahu]]. He again appeared February 9th, 2007 and was eliminated late into a winner takes $250,000 "last man standing" competition, being eliminated before Ken Jennings.

Rutter was the top seed in the ''[[Grand Slam (US TV series)|Grand Slam]]'' game show tournament, but lost in his second round match against [[Ogi Ogas]], a former ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire]]'' contestant. Rutter was one of four former ''Jeopardy!'' champions in the tournament (the other three being #13 seed Leszek Pawlowicz, #12 seed [[Frank Spangenberg]], and #2 seed [[Ken Jennings]]).
