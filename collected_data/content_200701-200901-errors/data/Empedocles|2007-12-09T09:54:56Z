'''Empedocles''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{Polytonic|Ἐμπεδοκλῆς}}, ca. [[490 BC|490]]–[[430 BC]]) was a [[Hellenic civilization|Greek]] [[pre-Socratic]] [[philosopher]] and a citizen of [[Agrigentum]], a Greek colony in [[Sicily]]. Empedocles' philosophy is best known for being the origin of the [[cosmogenesis|cosmogenic]] theory of the four [[classical elements]]. Much of Empedocles' work still survives today, more so than in the case of any other Presocratic. Empedocles' death was well recorded by his contemporaries, and has been the subject of both legend and a number of literary treatments.

==Philosophy==
[[Diogenes Laertius]] preserves a tradition, going back to the historian [[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeus]] that Empedocles was a lapsed initiate into the esoteric doctrines of [[Pythagoras]].  Such conjectures as this, as found in Diogenes' account of Empedocles in his ''Lives of Philosophers'', VIII <ref>[http://classicpersuasion.org/pw/diogenes/dlempedocles.htm Diogenes Laertius, ''Life of Empedocles'', VIII] (on-line text)</ref> provide most of our information. Empedocles delivered his philosophy in the form of epic verse. He maintained in Pythagorean fashion that all [[matter]] is made up of four elements: [[water (classical element)|water]], [[earth (classical element)|earth]], [[air (classical element)|air]] and [[fire (classical element)|fire]]. Empedocles called these the four "roots"; the term "element" (στοιχεῖον), was used only by later writers.

Apart from these four roots, Empedocles postulated something called [[Love]] (φιλία) to explain the attraction of different forms of matter, and of something called Strife (νεῖκος) to account for their separation. These ideas should not be confused with the four elements: if the elements are the content of the universe, then Love and Strife explain their variation and harmony. He was also one of the first people to state the theory that light travels at a finite (although very large) speed, a theory that gained acceptance only much later.

Though having much in common with [[Parmenides]]'s [[ontology]] (to which his own poem is often read as a response), Empedocles is considered softer and more tolerant in his outlook. [[Plato]], in the famous ''[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]'' [[dialogue]], described Empedocles as a "gentle muse":

:''Then there are Ionian, and in more recent times Sicilian muses, who have arrived at the conclusion that to unite the two principles is safer, and to say that being is one and many, and that these are held together by enmity and friendship, ever parting, ever meeting, as the-severer Muses assert, while the gentler ones do not insist on the perpetual strife and peace, but admit a relaxation and alternation of them; peace and unity sometimes prevailing under the sway of Aphrodite, and then again plurality and war, by reason of a principle of strife.'' ([[Plato]], ''Soph.'').

Empedocles was also a mystic and a poet, and [[Aristotle]] considered him the inventor of the study of [[rhetoric]].<ref>In Aristotle's ''Sophist'', according to Diogenes Laertius.</ref> [[Gorgias]] of Leontini was his student, and it is probably from Empedocles that Gorgias developed the notion of rhetoric as magic.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Empedocles' life, as recorded by Diogenes Laertius, was based partly on [[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeus]]' lost ''Histories'' and other sources, and seems at points to confuse him with other men of the same name. As a person he was reported by Diogenes as somewhat arrogant, that he "imitated the pompous demeanour, and way of life, and gestures of one master" [[Anaxagoras]], dressing himself in purple and claiming that by the virtue of the knowledge he possessed he had become divine and could perform miracles, as in the case of a dead woman's body, that he notoriously preserved from corruption, exclaiming in verses that Diogenes quotes:

:''I, an immortal God, no longer mortal,''
:''Now live among you well revered by all,''
:''As is my due, crowned with holy fillets''
:''And rosy garlands.''

Yet his actions and teaching betrayed an [[egalitarian]] streak, as in his opposition to a monument to Akron the physician, he fought to preserve Greek [[democracy]] and allowed that through his teaching others could also become divine{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. He even went so far to suggest that all living things were on the same spiritual plane, indicating he was influenced by [[Pythagoras|Pythagorean]] spirituality. Like Pythagoras, he believed in the [[Metempsychosis|transmigration of souls]] between humans and animals and followed a [[vegetarian]] lifestyle{{Fact|date=September 2007}}. He also propounded a theory of struggle in the animal kingdom that prefigures [[Charles Darwin|Darwin's]] theory of [[natural selection]].<ref>{{citation | last = Empedocles | authorlink = Empedocles | title = [http://history.hanover.edu/texts/presoc/emp.htm On Nature] | volume = Book II}}</ref> [[Aristotle]] discussed this proto-Darwinian theory in his ''[[Physics_%28Aristotle%29|Physics]]'', Book II, and rejected it:

:''A difficulty presents itself: why should not nature work, not for the sake of something, nor because it is better so, but just as the sky rains, not in order to make the corn grow, but out of necessity? . . . Similarly if a man's crop is spoiled on the threshing-floor, the rain did not fall for the sake of this . . .but that result just followed. Why then should it not be the same with the parts in natures, e.g., that our teeth should come up of necessity--the front teeth sharp, fitted for tearing, the molars broad and useful for grinding down the food--since they did not arise for this end, but it was merely a coincident result; and so with all other parts in which we suppose 'that there is purpose?' Wherever then all the parts came about just what they would have been if they had come about for an end, such things survived, being organized spontaneously in a fitting way; whereas those which grew otherwise perished and continue to perish, as Empedocles says his 'man-faced ox-progeny' did.''

His theory of effluences is also one of the first to speak of the distinct objects of perception. He believed that different objects could only be perceived by their respective parts (a bell ringing by the ear) because the object being perceived gave off certain effluences. These effluences were a certain size and shape and only the correct sized passageways could perceive them.  

Empedocles is considered the last Greek philosopher to write in verse and the surviving fragments of his teaching are from two poems, ''Purifications'' and ''On Nature''.

==Death and literary treatments==
Diogenes Laertius records the legend that he died by throwing himself into an active volcano ([[Mount Etna]] in Sicily), so that people would believe his body had vanished and he had turned into an immortal god; however, the volcano threw back one of his bronze sandals, revealing the deceit. The legend is likely to have little truth within it; there is evidence that he actually died in Greece{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.

Another legend has it that he threw himself in the volcano to prove to his disciples that he was immortal.  He genuinely seemed to believe he would come back as a god among man after being devoured by the fire.

In ''Icaro-Menippus'', a comedic dialogue written by the second century satirist [[Lucian of Samosata]], Empedocles’s final fate is re-evaluated. Rather than being incinerated in the fires of Mount Etna, he was carried up into the heavens by a volcanic eruption. Although a bit singed by the ordeal, Empedocles survives and continues his life on the moon, surviving by feeding on dew.

Empedocles' death has inspired two major modern literary treatments. Empedocles's death is the subject of [[Friedrich Hölderlin]]'s play ''Tod des Empedokles'' (''Death of Empedocles''), two versions of which were written between the years 1798 and 1800. A third version was made public in 1826. In [[Matthew Arnold]]'s poem ''Empedocles on Etna'', a narrative of the philosopher's last hours before he jumps to his death in the crater first published in 1852, Empedocles predicts:

:''To the elements it came from''
:''Everything will return.''
:''Our bodies to earth,''
:''Our blood to water,''
:''Heat to fire,''
:''Breath to air.''

In 2006, a massive underwater volcano off the coast of Sicily was named after Empedocles [http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/science/06/22/underwater.volcano.reut/index.html].
