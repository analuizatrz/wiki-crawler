'''''Beyond Fantasy Fiction''''' was a US [[fantasy]] fiction magazine edited by [[H. L. Gold]] in the years 1953-1955.  During this short time period, it published several significant short stories by distinguished authors, such as [[Isaac Asimov]], [[Ray Bradbury]] and [[Philip K. Dick]], and has generally been regarded as one of the best of the many new magazines launched in the 1950s. Nevertheless, it was not a commercial success, and lasted only ten issues.<ref name=Tuck_quality>Tuck states "Although it printed some very good material, it was never commercially successful."  {{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H.

==History and significance==
''Beyond Fantasy Fiction'' was planned by editor H.L. Gold and [[Galaxy Publishing]] as a [[fantasy]]-oriented companion to the more successful ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'', which had been launched in 1950.  Beyond's first issue, dated July 1953, included an editorial by Gold in which he laid out the magazine's scope, excluding (in his words) only "the probably possible" and "the unentertaining".<ref name=Clute_Grant_2>{{cite book|editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] & [[John Grant|Grant, John]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Fantasy| origdate= 1997| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| pages= 110}}</ref><ref name=issues>See the individual issues.

The quality of the fiction remained high throughout the magazine's life,<ref name=Tuck_quality /> with appearances from many well-known authors, and the magazine is often cited as being the successor to the unusual fantasy tradition of ''[[Unknown (magazine)|Unknown]]''.<ref name=Clute_Grant_1>Mike Ashley comments in the Clute ''Encyclopedia of Fantasy'' that ''Beyond'' "is generally acknowledged as the natural successor to Unknown". {{cite book|editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] & [[John Grant|Grant, John]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Fantasy| origdate= 1997|publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| pages= 110}}</ref>  However, the magazine was not commercially successful, and it lasted less than two years.  At that time circulation figures were not required to be published annually, as they were later,<ref name=ASF_1965>See for example the statement of circulation in {{cite journal | year = 1965 | month = December | title = Statement Required by the Act of October 23, 1962 | journal = Analog Science Fiction/Science Fact | volume = LXXVI | issue = 4 | pages = 161}}</ref> so the actual circulation figures are not known.

''Beyond'' published several significant or widely-reprinted stories during its short history.  These included:<ref name=Tuck_stories>All but the last of the list given are included by Tuck in his list of "Notable fiction" from Beyond.  The [[Philip K.

The cover art was often [[Surrealism|surrealist]], which was unusual for a genre magazine.  The cover painting for the first issue was by [[Richard M. Powers]]; Gold was one of the very few American magazine editors to use his work, though Powers was prolific in the paperback field.<ref>For example, the listing at the ISFDB mentions only a couple of magazine covers in Powers extensive oeuvre.  {{cite web | url = http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/ea.cgi?Richard%20Powers | title = Richard Powers: Summary Bibliography | accessmonthday=27 May | accessyear = 2007}}</ref><ref name=Nicholls_952>The Nicholls "Encyclopedia of SF" states that Powers' Surrealist style is "unique in sf".{{cite book|editor= [[Peter Nicholls|Nicholls, Peter]] & [[John Clute|Clute, John]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| origdate= 1993|publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York| pages= 952}}</ref>  In addition to Richard Powers, René Vidmer and Arthur Krusz (among others) contributed cover art.<ref name=issues />  The magazine carried interior artwork for almost every story throughout its life, usually including multiple illustrations for each story.  The best-known interior artist ''Beyond'' used was [[Ed Emshwiller]], though there were several other regulars.<ref name=issues />

A feature of the magazine was that every story included a facsimile of the author's signature, set at the end of the story.  The magazine carried almost no non-fiction, though there were occasional "filler" pieces to fill spaces at the end of stories.  There were no book reviews, and only the first issue carried an editorial.<ref name=issues />

==Bibliographic details==
[[Image:BeyondFantasyFictionMar54.jpg|thumb|160px|left|March 1954 issue of ''Beyond Fantasy Fiction''.  Art by Scott Templar.]]The publisher was Galaxy Publishing Corporation, New York, throughout.  The magazine was initially titled "Beyond Fantasy Fiction", and this remained the title on the masthead throughout the ten-issue run.  However, issue 9 changed the title to simply "Beyond Fiction" on the cover, spine, and table of contents.  Issue 10 used the new, shorter title on the cover and spine, but reverted to "Beyond Fantasy Fiction" for the table of contents.  As a result the magazine is often listed as having changed its name for the last two issues.<ref name=issues /><ref name=Tuck>{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H. Tuck| title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Volume 3| publisher=Advent: Publishers, Inc. | location=Chicago | year=1982 | pages = 549|id=ISBN 0-911682-26-0}}</ref>

The magazine began as a 160-page [[Digest size|digest]], priced at 35 cents.  The price stayed the same throughout the run, but the page count was cut to 128 for the eighth issue, September 1954.  The magazine was bimonthly throughout, but issues 9 and 10 did not carry month and year dates, which has led different bibliographers to catalogue them in different ways.  However, the masthead for these issues indicates that the magazine remained bimonthly, and so they are now usually catalogued as November 1954 and January 1955, respectively; the copyright dates on the last two issues correspond to these dates.  The volume numbering was completely regular; volume 1 had six numbers, and volume 2 ceased with its fourth number.<ref name=issues /><ref name=Tuck />

A British edition of the magazine ran for four issues.  These copied the first four issues of the US version, with slightly cut contents; they were numbered 1 to 4.  They were not dated, but appeared on a bimonthly schedule starting in November 1953 and finishing in May 1954.<ref name=Clute_Grant_2 /><ref name=Tuck />

Nine stories from the magazine were collected into the 160-page paperback ''Beyond'', published in 1963 by Berkley (F712), edited by Thomas Dardis (who was not credited on the book).<ref name=Clute_Grant_2 />
