Azula is a gifted [[Firebender]] and highly favored [[crown princess]] of the [[Fire Nation]]. In addition, she is the first female Firebender to appear in the series, and is the Firebender silhouetted in the opening credits of each episode. She is initially bent on retrieving her exiled brother, [[Zuko|Prince Zuko]], and delivering him to their father, [[List of Avatar: The Last Airbender major secondary characters#Fire Lord Ozai|Fire Lord Ozai]]. During season 2, she was accompanied on her search by her childhood [[Azula#Allies|friends]], [[List of Avatar: The Last Airbender major secondary characters#Mai|Mai]] and [[List of Avatar: The Last Airbender major secondary characters#Ty Lee|Ty Lee]].

== Creation and conception ==

=== Musical Theme ===
Azula's theme is based on the Fire Nation theme that can be heard throughout the entirety of the series. The Fire Nation theme is mostly composed of drums, bass trombones and French horns in very low registers.<ref name="ASNtrack3" /> Due to the masculine sound of the Fire Nation theme, The Track Team decided to alter it into a more feminine, but powerful, sound for Azula. They combined the [[gamelan]]'s eerie bell like quality with a choir to highlight her deeply rooted and controlled evil. The theme is also supposed to help portray her as malevolent, not crazy.<ref name="ASNtrack3">{{cite web |url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/interviews.php?id=4 |title=Music Interview with the Track Team |accessdate=2008-04-08 |author=Acastus |date=2006-07-23 |work=Interview |publisher=Avatar Spirit.Net}}</ref>

== Plot overview ==
[[Image:Azula Hates Barbie2.png|thumb|right|250px|Azula's cruelty was evident even as a child.]]
Azula was born to Prince Ozai and Princess Ursa around two years after her brother, [[Zuko]]. As such, she is the descendant of both Fire Lord Sozin (from Ozai) and Avatar Roku (from Princess Ursa).<ref name="The Avatar And The Firelord">{{cite episode|title=The Avatar and the Firelord|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=306|airdate=2007-10-24|season=3|number=6|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=306|credits=Director: Ethan Spaulding; Writer: Elizabeth Welch Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref>
She is named for her grandfather, Ozai's father, [[List of Avatar: The Last Airbender minor book 2 characters#Fire Lord Azulon|Fire Lord Azulon]]. Azula grew up in the riches, splendor, and privileges of being royalty in the Fire Nation. Even when she was only [[Zuko Alone|ten years old]], Azula expressed her natural talents, along with her tendency for malice and perfectionism. Her sharp wits and the prodigy she displayed towards [[Firebending]] gained her much attention and acclaim and made her Ozai's favorite child. Her father began raising her as his true heir early on, taking her into his confidence and grooming her in politics while ignoring Zuko. From the quality of her [[Fire Nation#Azula’s Ship|ship]] and soldiers, her favored status was readily apparent.

She had no desire to waste time playing around like a regular girl. She was much more interested in power, suggesting that her father would make a better Fire Lord than the [[heir apparent]], her [[Uncle Iroh]], whom she also dubbed "a quitter and a loser" for abandoning his siege at Ba Sing Se.<ref name="Zuko Alone">{{cite episode|title=Zuko Alone|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=207|airdate=2006-05-12|season=2|number=7|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=207|credits=Director: Lauren MacMullan; Writer: Elizabeth Welch Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref>
No love developed between her and Zuko throughout the next few years—when he was burned by their father in an Agni Kai, she watched with a [[Schadenfreude|savage triumph]].<ref name="The Storm">{{cite episode|title=The Storm|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=112|airdate=2005-06-03|season=1|number=12|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=112|credits=Director: Lauren MacMullan; Writer: Aaron Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref>

In the first season, it was revealed that Azula was present for the [[Fire Nation#Agni Kai|Agni Kai]] in which Prince Zuko receives his facial scar from his father.<ref name="The Storm">{{cite episode|title=The Storm|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=112|airdate=2005-06-03|season=1|number=12|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=112|credits=Director: Lauren MacMullan; Writer: Aaron Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref> At the end of the season, after the Siege of the North, Ozai orders Azula to arrest Zuko and Iroh.<ref name="The Siege of the North Part 2">{{cite episode|title=The Siege of the North, Part II|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=120|airdate=2005-12-02|season=1|number=20|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=120|credits=Director: Dave Filoni; Writer: Aaron Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref>

Azula first encountered [[Aang|the Avatar]] in Omashu during the second season, where she and Aang battle. Soon after, she named the Avatar as a personal target in addition to her brother and enlists the help of her friends [[List of Avatar: The Last Airbender major secondary characters#Ty Lee|Ty Lee]] and [[List of Avatar: The Last Airbender major secondary characters#Mai|Mai]].<ref name="Return To Omashu">{{cite episode|title=Return to Omashu|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=203|airdate=2006-04-07|season=2|number=3|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=203|credits=Director: Ethan Spaulding; Writer: Elizabeth Welch Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref> Azula continues to pursue the Avatar for the rest of the season, in place of her brother Zuko. While in Ba Sing Se, though, Azula is side tracked by her [[wiktionary:conquest|conquest]] of the city, which was the capital of the Earth Kingdom. Eventually, she is able to convince her brother to help her secure Ba Sing Se and take down the Avatar.  During their showdown in Ba Sing Se, it appears Azula mortally wounds Aang, while he is in the Avatar State.  It is assumed that the Avatar State has now become broken, although Azula suspects Aang survived. She eventually blames this on her brother.<ref name="The Earth King">{{cite episode|title=The Earth King|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=218|airdate=2006-11-16|season=2|number=18|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=218|credits=Director: Ethan Spaulding; Writer: John O'Bryan|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref>

[[Image:DontU4get.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Azula, Ty Lee, Mai, and Zuko stand together.]] <!-- Image has fair use rationale. See Image:Image:DontU4get.jpg -->
Upon returning home in the third season, it is revealed that Azula has not taken credit for the murder of the Avatar. She gave the credit to Zuko to make him feel better when he faces their father and repay him for his aid in the siege of Ba Sing Se. After Zuko connotes that she's lying, Azula deduces that in case the Avatar was still alive, all of Zuko's glory would turn to shame.<ref name="The Awakening">{{cite episode|title=The Awakening|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=301|airdate=2007-09-21|season=3|number=1|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=301|credits=Director: Giancarlo Volpe; Writer: Aaron Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref> On "The Day of Black Sun", Azula serves as a distraction to keep Aang, Sokka, and Toph from finding Firelord Ozai.<ref name="The Eclipse">{{cite episode|title=The Day of Black Sun Part 2: The Eclipse|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=311|airdate=2007-11-26|season=3|number=11|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=311|credits=Director: Joaquim dos Santos; Writer: Aaron Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref>

At the 2008 Comic-Con in New York, a trailer was shown for the upcoming episodes in the series. In the footage, Azula seems to be losing her temper and her self-control. If the clip is watched in slow motion, Azula's Mother, Ursa, can be seen in the mirror. The recent leaks of the upcoming Book 3: Fire, Vol. 4 DVD covers reveal that Ozai appoints Azula as Firelord in his stead.

== Personality ==
A dedicated nationalist, Azula relentlessly drills herself towards perfection and will settle for nothing less.<ref name="The Avatar State" /> Even as a child she was seen to react with hostility when outdone.<ref name="Zuko Alone" /> She is rather vain and believes that power and domination are what makes a person strong.<ref name="The Crossroads of Destiny" />

She is known for being one of the cruelest characters in the series. From a very young age, Azula demonstrated [[Sadism and Masochism|sadistic]] aggression and lack of remorse,<ref name="Zuko Alone" /> which suggest that Azula could be a [[Dissocial personality disorder|sociopath]]. Her cruel and seemingly total lack of compassion extends to all of her family.<ref name="Zuko Alone" />

Her [[apathy]] also accounts for her ability to create and direct [[lightning]], as the skill requires peace of mind<ref name="Bitter Work">

Ironically, for all her refinement and self-confidence, Azula does retain some unsureness. As a result of her sequestered life of royalty, Azula has come to develop a considerable amount of [[social ineptitude]], particularly in her uncertainty of how to act around boys. Her over-competitive nature surfaces during a [[Footvolley|Kuai ball]] game, where, despite it being a friendly game, she turns an opponents slight lameness against her and overly crushes their opponent. She later admits her jealousy over how much attention Ty Lee receives from boys. <ref name="The Beach">{{cite episode
