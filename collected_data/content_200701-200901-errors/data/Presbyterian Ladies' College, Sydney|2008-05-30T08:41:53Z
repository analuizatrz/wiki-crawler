== History ==
===Foundation===
[[Image:PLCFernlea1888.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Fernlea, PLC's first home in Ashfield, c.1888]]
The idea of a Presbyterian College in Sydney arose in 1883, when the [[General Assembly (presbyterian church)|General Assembly]] of the Presbyterian Church of New South Wales formed a special committee to investigate the establishment of superior [[boarding school]]s for girls and boys. The church saw an urgency to provide Presbyterian education in the colony due to the growth in [[Roman Catholic]] [[secondary school]]s.<ref name="GH1"/> Many Presbyterians had expressed fear of the outcome of this growth, with the Minister at [[Richmond, New South Wales|Richmond]], Rev. James Cameron stating: 
"Presbyterians should take prompt action because the Popish party, seeing the want that was felt throughout the colony in regard to higher education, has stepped in to supply that want, and if Protestants did not look to the matter, the Roman Catholics would take advantage of them."<ref name="GH1"/> 

The New South Wales (N.S.W) [[Scottish people|Scottish]] community had also expressed dissatisfaction with the educational options available to their children. The N.S.W Assembly was however also inspired to establish a school, particularly a Ladies' College, by less worthy motives. For example, other [[Protestant]] denominations in N.S.W had recently established their own Ladies' Colleges, and the "rival" colony of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] had had a Presbyterian Ladies' College since 1875, and so it was felt that N.S.W Presbyterians should also have one.<ref name="GH1"/> 
[[Image:JohnMarden.jpg|right|thumb|150px|PLC's first Principal, Dr. John Marden]]
At the 1884 Assembly it was announced that a school for boys was not necessary due to the existence of establishments such as [[Sydney Grammar School]] and the [[Cooerwull Academy]]. The Committee however felt that the present secondary education options available for girls were not satisfactory, and recommended that a Ladies' College, similar to the [[Presbyterian Ladies' College, Melbourne]], be established as soon as possible. A Ladies' College Committee was subsequently formed to undertake the task.<ref name="GH1"/> 

By July 1887, the committee had leased a property in [[Ashfield, New South Wales|Ashfield]] and advertised for an appropriate [[Principal (school)|Principal]]. They unanimously selected [[John Marden|Dr. John Marden]], a [[science]] master from the [[Methodist Ladies' College, Melbourne|Methodist Ladies' College]] (M.L.C) in [[Melbourne, Victoria|Melbourne]], "because of his high academic standing, his experience and success in teaching and his high Christian character."<ref name="GH9">{{cite book| last = McFarlane| first = John| title = The Golden Hope: Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney 1888-1988| year = 1988| pages = p. 9| chapter = Firm Foundations 1888-1919}}</ref> Marden was a strong believer in [[equal opportunity]] in education, and has been described as an "early feminist" and "truly a man before his time."<ref name="SMH1988">{{cite news| title = The Girls of PLC have made history| url = http://newsstore.smh.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&sy=smh&kw=%22presbyterian+ladies+college%22&pb=all_ffx&dt=selectRange&dr=entire&so=relevance&sf=author&sf=headline&sf=text&rc=10&rm=200&sp=nrm&clsPage=1&docID=news880406_0250_8026| work = Northern Herald| publisher = ''The Sydney Morning Herald'' | page = 26| date = 1988-04-06| accessdate = 2007-09-12}}</ref> He scorned the idea that P.L.C was to be some kind of [[finishing school]] for the daughters of the wealthy,<ref name="GH18"/> and was once quoted as saying: 
<blockquote> 
I am ... out of sympathy with the cry that education is unnecessary for girls, and that all they require is a few accomplishments. Women have also to live their life - in most cases a harder one than men have. This notion of accomplishments being sufficient for girls is surely a remnant of those barbarous days when women were looked on as the plaything of men.<ref name="GH18">{{cite book| last = McFarlane| first = John| title = The Golden Hope: Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney 1888-1988| year = 1988| pages = p.18| chapter = Firm Foundations 1888-1919}}</ref> 
</blockquote> 

The Presbyterian Ladies' College was finally opened by Marden, accompanied by lady [[superintendent (education)|superintendent]], Ms M. McCormick,<ref name="ADBMarden"/> with 39&nbsp;girls, on [[30 January]] [[1888]], at Fernlea, a 14-roomed gentleman's residence set in {{convert|3|acre|ha|0}} of ground at Victoria Street, Ashfield, the current site of the Masonic Hospital.<ref name="GH1">{{cite book| last = McFarlane| first = John| title = The Golden Hope: Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney 1888-1988| year = 1988| pages = p. 1&ndash;4| chapter = Genesis 1883-1887}}</ref> It was modelled on the [[Public Schools Act 1868|great English Public Schools]],<ref name="GH29"/> and was the first school to be established by the Presbyterian Church of New South Wales.<ref name="GHvii"/> Together with the Committee, Marden was responsible for organising the [[curriculum]] and hiring the appropriate staff.<ref name=Principals/>
[[Image:PLCShubra1892.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Shubra Hall and PLC students, 1892]]
By August 1888, the College had outgrown the Ashfield residence, which the committee had always considered to be a temporary home, and the newly established P.L.C Council, consisting of the Principal, six trustees (guarantors) and four members elected by the Assembly, began discussing alternative sites in the nearby suburb of Croydon. On [[5 September]] [[1889]], Col. John Hay Goodlet, an Elder of the Ashfield Kirk Session and benefactor of the Church,<ref name="ADBGoodlet">{{cite encyclopedia| last = Teale| first = Ruth| encyclopedia = Australian Dictionary of Biography| title = Goodlet, John Hay (1835 - 1914)| url = http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A040298b.htm?hilite=presbyterian%3Bladies%3Bcollege | accessdate = 2008-03-22 | edition = Online| year = 1972| publisher = Melbourne University Press| volume = 4| location = Melbourne, Vic. | pages = pp.263-264}}</ref> told the council of Shubra Hall, the home of department store owner [[Anthony Hordern & Sons|Anthony Hordern III]] at Croydon. The property was subsequently purchased on 26 October for Â£7,500, and plans were drawn up for the additional buildings required. By the beginning of the school year of 1891, the new site was complete and ready for furnishing as the permanent home of P.L.C. Marden worked closely with Albert Bond, the [[architect]] of the new school, and was responsible for most of the ideas for the new buildings, based on what he had seen at M.L.C Melbourne.<ref name="GH29"/> Keenly interested in [[horticulture]], he also laid out gardens and [[playing field]]s.<ref name="ADBMarden">{{cite encyclopedia| last = Dougan| first = Alan| encyclopedia = Australian Dictionary of Biography| title = Marden, John (1855 - 1924)| url = http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A100396b.htm?hilite=John%3BMarden| accessdate = 2007-08-10 | edition = Online| year = 1986| publisher = Melbourne University Press| volume = 10| location = Melbourne, Vic. | pages = pp.407-408}}</ref>

''The Presbyterian'' reported of the opening of the College on [[10 March]] [[1891]], by the [[Governor of New South Wales|Governor of N.S.W.]], the [[Victor Child-Villiers, 7th Earl of Jersey|Rt. Hon. Victor Albert George, 7th Earl of Jersey]] at its new site: 
<blockquote>
Standing in six acres of ground, laid out in lawn tennis courts, gardens, etc., in an elevated position, it forms, with its tower 84&nbsp;ft [26&nbsp;m] high, a very conspicuous feature in the landscape. The central feature of the building is the tower, and the architectural design of the facade is classic. Altogether the effect is very imposing ... The main staircase window is a work of art well worth seeing. The central window is beautifully designed, and contains two female figures representing Literature and Music.<ref name="GH29">{{cite book| last = McFarlane| first = John| title = The Golden Hope: Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney 1888-1988| year = 1988| pages = pp. 29&ndash;37| chapter = Firm Foundations 1888-1919}}</ref>
</blockquote>
[[Image:PLC1891.jpg|thumb||right|250px|Basketball Team, 1902]]
During the opening ceremony the Governor invited his wife, the [[Countess]] of Jersey, Margaret Child-Villiers, to speak. The Countess made what the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' described as a "capital impromptu speech."<ref name="GH29"/> In part she said: "You cannot help being a great force in the future of your country ... you girls will be able to do far more for your native country, far more towards forming the character of the nation."<ref name="GH29"/> The Countess's speech was widely reported throughout Australia and parts of the world, as at the time it was quite unusual for a woman to speak in public.<ref name="GH29"/> P.L.C's Jersey Day, an annual event where [[Alumni|ex-students]] return to the College on the Sunday closest to 10 March, is named in honour of the Countess.<ref name="Jersey">{{Citation | title=Jersey Day and its Origin | newspaper=The Ex-students' Union News: The Annual Newsletter of the Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney Ex-students' Union| issue=75 | pages=1 | year=2006 | date=September 2006}}</ref>

===Growth===
In the early years at Croydon, girls tended to be enrolled at an older age, typically over fourteen. It was apparent that despite Marden's insistence, many parents viewed the College as a finishing school. As with today, it was not a requirement for students to be Presbyterians in order to attend, and early school roll's indicate that there were a number of Roman Catholic and [[Jewish]] students. By 1900 the reputation of the school had spread, and pupils were starting to come from a wide geographic area, including [[New Caledonia]], [[Fiji]], [[New Zealand]], the [[Northern Territory]], [[Western Australia]], [[Queensland]] and [[South Australia]].<ref name=GH24>{{cite book| last = McFarlane| first = John| title = The Golden Hope: Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney 1888-1988| year = 1988| pages = pp.24-26| chapter = Firm Foundations 1888-1919}}</ref> Marden believed that women should share in opportunities for [[Secondary school|secondary]] and [[tertiary education]], and also hold high [[Christian]] ideals. Although trained as a [[lawyer]], he gave [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and [[biology]] a prominent place at a time when few schools included much science in the curriculum.<ref name="ADBMarden"/>
[[Image:Croydon Shubra Hall PLC.JPG|230px|thumb|left|PLC Main School, built 1890]]
By 1902 space had become a problem due to increasing student numbers, and Marden urged that new classrooms be built, which Council reluctantly agreed to. These buildings, an extension to Main School, and comprising six&nbsp;classrooms downstairs and 18&nbsp;rooms upstairs, were finished and handed over by the [[contractor]] on [[6 October]] [[1904]], at a cost of Â£2,000.<ref name="GH29"/> 

The increase in enrolments also convinced Council of the need to set up a branch school on another site, preferably on the [[North Shore (Sydney)|North Shore]]. A committee was set up in June 1907 to study the feasibility of a second school, yet recommendations were not considered by the Council. By 1913, space at the college was at a premium, and Marden reported that many applications were being refused because of "shortness of space."<ref name="GH29"/> The matter was taken to the Assembly of 1913, resulting in the approval of the establishment of a branch at [[Pymble, New South Wales|Pymble]] under the Council of P.L.C Croydon. The Council was given Â£5,000 to erect new buildings and lay out the grounds. The [[Presbyterian Ladies' College, Pymble]] was opened on [[8 February]] [[1916]] with 48 day girls and 86 boarders. Marden became the Principal of both schools. The opening of the Pymble campus necessitated a change of name for the Croydon College, from The Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney to The Presbyterian Ladies' College, Croydon.<ref name="GH29"/>

Marden retired at the end of 1919 and a Principal was appointed to each branch. [[Ewen Neil McQueen|Dr E. Neil McQueen]], a prominent educational innovator who had previously been the Vice-Principal of the two schools, became the second Principal of P.L.C Croydon.<ref name="GH29"/>  

The Presbyterian Ladies' College, [[Beecroft, New South Wales|Beecroft]] was established by P.L.C Croydon in 1924 with 13 students. It was to serve as a [[Primary school|primary]] [[feeder school]] for the College, however it did not receive adequate attention from college council and was forced to close in 1929. This school was reopened in 1930 by the assistant teacher, Ms Gurney, who named it Arden, and thus [[Arden Anglican School]] is still in existence today.<ref name="GH58">{{cite book| last = McFarlane| first = John| title = The Golden Hope: Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney 1888-1988| year = 1988| pages = pp. 58&ndash;62| chapter = Reform Rejected 1920-1929}}</ref>

===Second World War===
[[Image:PLCSketch1935.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Sketch of P.L.C, featuring gardens and the Shubra Hall and Main School towers, c. 1935]]
In 1942, the new Principal, Dr. Helen Wilkie, arrived to find falling enrolments, staffing problems and food shortages due to the effects of the [[Second World War]]. Word was soon received that [[Australian military]] authorities wished to inspect the school with a view to taking it over. On [[24 March]] [[1942]], it was requested that P.L.C be occupied by the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) for the purpose of establishing a top secret [[Radar|Radar Unit]] and military [[barracks]]<ref name="GH89">{{cite book| last = McFarlane| first = John| title = The Golden Hope: Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney 1888-1988| year = 1988| pages = pp. 89&ndash;98| chapter =War And Disruption 1942-1945}}</ref> known as No.1 RIMU (Radio Installation and Maintenance Unit).<ref name="Radar">{{Citation | last=Bellamy |first=Craig |publication-date=March 2007 |year=2007 |title=Tributes: Frank Cooper |periodical=Radar Returns: Signals & Echoes For RAAF Radar Veterans |publication-place=Hampton, Victoria |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=p. 3 |url=http://www.radarreturns.net.au/assets/issues/rrvol12no1.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=2007-08-26}}</ref> As a result, Council approached [[Meriden School]] in [[Strathfield, New South Wales|Strathfield]] to see if P.L.C could be accommodated there. Meriden agreed to house the P.L.C boarders and to accommodate singing, [[domestic science]], and physical education classes. Further, the school purchased Lingwood, a property in Strathfield, as a centre for the schools remaining activities.<ref name="GH89"/>

At the end of 1942, the Meriden authorities indicated that they could no longer house the P.L.C boarders, so Lauriston (now the primary school of [[Santa Sabina College]]) and Welbeck, on The Boulevarde at Strathfield were rented to accommodate them. In July 1944, the owners of Lingwood asked if the school was interested in buying the property. Council agreed to the purchase in order to use the house as a Kindergarten [[feeder school]] for the College, or as a site for a permanent move. A few months later, Council decided that the future of P.L.C lay in Strathfield, and offered the Croydon campus to the military for Â£36,500. Plans were subsequently drawn up to purchase Welbeck and Lauriston to form the new P.L.C, however Council's wish for the school to stay in Strathfield was not shared by most of the school community.<ref name="GH89"/> 
[[Image:Strathfield Santa Maria Del Monte Lauriston.JPG|220px|thumb|left|Lauriston, Part of P.L.C's war-time Strathfield Campus]]
Following intervention by the Education Trust of the N.S.W General Assembly in 1945, Council decided that the Strathfield proposal was not viable. It was agreed that P.L.C would reopen at Croydon in first [[Academic term|term]] 1946. The military agreed to pay for the extensive renovations that were required, with the final cheque was handed over by the government on [[21 March]] [[1949]]. Lauriston and Welbeck were subsequently disposed of in 1946, however the Lingwood property was retained as a [[preparatory school]]. Negotiations were entered into with Margaret Thompson, the owner and principal of Branxton, a [[private school]] in Homebush Road, Strathfield. It was agreed that Thompson would close her school and move it to the Lingwood property where it would retain the name Branxton,{{Ref_label|b|b|none}} and come under the control of P.L.C Council. Branxton had an informal link to the College prior to 1946, as it had been founded by the sister of an ex&ndash;student, and many Branxton students had gone on to complete their [[high school]] education at P.L.C.<ref name="GH89"/>

Evidence of P.L.C's war-time occupation remain, with tunnels and [[bomb shelter]]s accessible from below the stage of College Hall. A [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] presented to the school by the RAAF in commemoration of P.L.C's war-time involvement, may be found at the entrance to the Main School, on the school [[Verandah]].<ref name="GH89"/>

===Church Union===
In 1977, a [[Basis of Union (Uniting Church in Australia)|Union]] of the [[Congregational church|Congregational]], [[Methodist]] and Presbyterian Churches took place, forming the [[Uniting Church of Australia]]. Approximately half of the Presbyterian Church decided to remain Presbyterian, and consequently the property of the Church had to be divided. In May of that year, it was announced that P.L.C Croydon was to remain Presbyterian, and P.L.C Pymble would be transferred, with its name changed to Pymble Ladies' College. Subsequently, in 1978 it was decided that P.L.C Croydon should return to its originally intended name of The Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney.<ref name="GH129">{{cite book| last = McFarlane| first = John| title = The Golden Hope: Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney 1888-1988| year = 1988| pages = p. 129| chapter =Preparation For Expansion 1977-1985}}</ref>

===Modern day===
[[Image:PLCSyd120years.jpg|right|thumb|100px|PLC Sydney 120&nbsp;Year Anniversary Logo]]
In late August 2005, due to financial troubles at the [[Presbyterian Ladies' College, Armidale]], it was announced that P.L.C Armidale and P.L.C Sydney would join to form an alliance, with both schools coming under the executive leadership of Dr William McKeith, the Principal of P.L.C Sydney. Members of the P.L.C Armidale Council formed part of the new joint school Council, essentially making the two P.L.C's true [[sister school]]s.<ref name=pcnsw>{{Citation| last=Falls| first=Jeof| publication-date=September-October| year=2005| title=New Partnership between PLC Armidale and PLC Sydney| periodical=Church Offices Newsletter| publication-place=Surry Hills| publisher=The Presbyterian Church in New South Wales| issue=288| pages=3| url=http://pcnsw.org.au/LocalSite/pdf/newsletters/SepOct2005.pdf|format=PDF| accessdate=2007-06-28}}</ref> 

The aim of this alliance is to strengthen P.L.C Armidale through cooperative marketing, a change in management and a stronger financial base. It is also to be of benefit to both schools through student exchanges, accommodation for sporting events or [[excursion]]s, and a 'country or city' option for prospective students. Both schools will maintain their separate identities in order to preserve the unique histories and traditions that both have developed over many years.<ref name=pcnsw/>

===Special education===
P.L.C also offers a unique [[special education]] unit catering to students with mild to moderate [[intellectual disabilities]]. The transition program was developed in 1992 in response to a decision by academic staff to provide a special-needs stream. Through this unit, up to 20 girls between the ages of 11 and 18 are provided with an individual program incorporating mainstream classes where possible.<ref name=Specialneeds>{{cite news| first = Perrie| last = Croshaw| title = Special needs met| url = http://newsstore.smh.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&sy=smh&kw=%22PLC+Sydney%22&pb=all_ffx&dt=selectRange&dr=10years&so=relevance&sf=text&sf=headline&rc=10&rm=200&sp=nrm&clsPage=1&docID=SMH0702086P6N71NB3U7| work = Supplement| publisher = ''The Sydney Morning Herald''| page = 2| date = 2007-02-08| accessdate = 2007-10-08}}</ref>

The senior transition program for older students focuses on the Board of Studies Life Skills program. As part of this program, girls spend time as residential students in the on-campus Transition House, learning to self-cater and self-manage. Transition students also run an outdoor cafe as a small business, to gain related business skills.<ref name=Specialneeds/>

P.L.C's school through this programme is Senehasa Counselling, Training and Rehabilitation Centre for Girls.<ref name=AdoptaSchool>{{cite web |url=http://www.plc.nsw.edu.au/public2/adopt_a_school.asp |title=Adopt a School |accessdate=2007-04-23 |work=International |publisher=Presbyterian Ladies' College}}</ref>

== Fees ==
As with most Australian private schools, P.L.C is not a full fee paying institution, due to it receiving government funding; full fees only apply to international students, who are not subsidised by any government funding. For non-international students, 2008 fees range from [[Australian dollar|AU$]]11,360 to $20,150 per annum, and in excess of AU$32,000 per annum for boarding students.<ref name=Fees08/>

P.L.C Sydney offers [[scholarship]]s and bursaries that provide full or part remission of tuition fees to students who are Australian citizens, Permanent Residents of Australia or refugees. Academic scholarships are based on the results of the [[Australian Council for Educational Research|ACER]] Scholarship Examination, and are typically offered from Year&nbsp;7 onwards. In addition to those awarded for academic performance, P.L.C also offers music and boarding scholarships. Indigenous Bursary's are available for students of [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] or [[Torres Strait Islanders|Torres Strait Islander]] background, and are awarded following an interview with the Principal where the situation of the individual student and the family is considered.<ref name=Scholarships>{{cite web |url=http://www.plc.nsw.edu.au/public2/scholarships.asp |title=Scholarships and Bursaries |accessdate=2007-12-26 |work=Enrolment |publisher=Presbyterian Ladies' College}}</ref>

== Motto and crest ==
[[Image:PLCCigaretteCard.jpg|thumb|150px|Collectable Cigarette card featuring the P.L.C colours and crest, c. 1910s]]   
The school [[Coat of arms|crest]] was adopted at a College Council meeting on [[23 August]] [[1888]]. The College Council decided to use the same crest as that used by the [[Presbyterian Church of New South Wales]], but with minor modifications.<ref name="GH298"/>

The Church's crest consisted of a shield with the words ''Nec Tamen Consumebatur'' (translated from [[Latin]] as "And yet it was not consumed")<ref name=PresbyterianChurch>{{Citation| year=2004 | title=An Introduction to the Presbyterian Church of Australia | place= Sydney | publisher=Code Committee of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church of Australia | volume=1 | pages=p. 21 | url=http://www.presbyterian.org.au/PDF/AnIntroductiont%20thePCABooklet.pdf | format=PDF| accessdate=2007-08-06}}</ref> surrounding it. The shield featured the stars of the [[Southern Cross]], a [[burning bush]], and in outline, a [[Latin cross]]. At the base were the [[floral emblem]]s of Scotland, England and Ireland. Surrounding the shield was a border with the words "Presbyterian Church of New South Wales", with a [[Star of David]] placed on top. Behind both shield and borders was the [[Saint Andrew's Cross|cross of St. Andrew]] in blue.<ref name="GH298"/> 
     
The School modified the crest by changing the words Presbyterian Church of New South Wales to Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney, placing a [[Maltese cross]] at the top of the shield and inserting the School [[motto]] ''Sancte Sapienter''. The motto had been adopted by the school on 23 August 1888, and although no [[translation]] was given of the Latin, it may be loosely translated to "be holy wisely" or "holy, wisely."<ref name="GH298"/> 

== School badge ==   
The school's highly symbolic badge was inspired by the first Principal, Dr. Marden, and designed in 1888 by the first art teacher, J.A. Bennett. The maiden on the lion represents Knowledge, which is crowned by a tower representing the home, and holding a [[trident]] representing [[Sovereignty]]. A [[laurel wreath]] represents the victory of true womanhood, while the sun symbolises light and energy, and the [[crescent moon]] stands for [[youth]]. The words Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney surround the badge.<ref name="GH299"/> 
[[Image:PLCBadge.jpg|left|thumb|160px|PLC Sydney school badge]]
The motto ''All'Ultimo Lavoro'' is [[French (language)|French]] and comes from [[Dante]]. It has variously been translated as: "for the crowning task", "strive for the highest", "the utmost for the highest", or "I work for the highest."<ref name="GH299"/>   
       
The badge is reproduced in the [[leadlight]] over the front door of Shubra Hall,<ref name="GH299"/> and may also be found on the recently opened Ex-Students pathway. It was traditionally worn as part of the uniform on the [[tam-o-shanter]], until it was phased out in 1995. The badge is currently not worn on the academc uniform, partially due to its adoption by Pymble Ladies' College as their school crest in 1977.<ref name="GH299"/> It was however reintroduced in 2003 as an addition to the Beret of the P.L.C Pipes and Drums uniform, and is also used by the college's [[Alumni association|ex-student's union]] as it has since 1905, with the addition of the words "Ex-students Union" below.<ref name="GH299"/>

When the College first opened in 1888 there was no uniform, rather the girls wore long cotton dresses, gloves and hat. The early 20th century saw the introduction of a straw [[Boater (hat)|boater]], worn with a red and white hat band featuring the college crest with its [[burning bush]] woven into it in red. [[Prefects]] during this time wore red silk arm-bands embroidered with a gold crest.<ref name="GH309">{{cite book| last = McFarlane| first = John| title = The Golden Hope: Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney 1888-1988| year = 1988| pages = pp. 309&ndash;311| chapter =The School Uniform}}</ref> 

The distinctive Black Watch Tartan of the college was introduced in 1918. Senior girls wore heavy box-pleated skirts and white blouses, and junior girls wore pinafore dresses. All girls wore a navy blazer and heavy woollen stockings. Prefects at the time also wore a special hat badge with a ring of bright blue enamel. A black felt Breton was introduced for winter use, and no change was made until the introduction of the green beret in 1952.<ref name="GH309"/>
 
1966 saw the introduction of the current Year 11 and 12 uniform. The uniform was designed by the senior students of 1965 and consists of a Black Watch kilt, white blouse, green blazer, green jumper or vest, black stockings for winter and bottle green knee-high socks for summer, and black leather lace-up shoes. Girls of [[Scotland|Scottish]] origin are permitted wear the [[kilt pin]] representing their family or [[Scottish clan|clan]] name, rather than the standard school pin. A green and Black Watch [[tam-o-shanter]] (known as 'the Beret') was also introduced for all grades a few years earlier.<ref name="GH309"/> 

1995 saw the phasing out of the school's distinctive Beret as girls found it difficult to wear,<ref name="Aurora1995">{{Citation | title=Happenings | newspaper=Aurora Australis: The Magazine of the Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney | year=1995}}</ref> and this was replaced by the current [[Panama hat]]. The Beret was however reintroduced in 2003 as an addition to the [[Pipes and Drums]] uniform. 

The current junior (R&ndash;10) uniform was introduced in 1997. In summer, girls are required to wear a Black Watch tunic, short-sleeve white blouse, green blazer with tartan piping, short green socks and black leather shoes. The winter uniform consists of the tunic, long-sleeve white blouse, the blazer, green jumper or vest, Black Watch Tartan tie, Black Watch Tartan scarf and either green knee-high socks or black stockings.<ref name=BoardingHandbook>{{cite web |url=http://www.plc.nsw.edu.au/public/boardinghousehandbook.pdf |title=Boarding House Handbook |accessdate=2007-06-21 |year=2006 |format=PDF |work=Boarding|publisher=Presbyterian Ladies' College}}</ref> School pockets are awarded for student achievements, and are [[Embroidery|embroidered]] in red on the pockets of junior blazers (R&ndash;10 girls), and white on the left-brest of senior blazers (11&ndash;12 girls).

=== College tartan ===   
The school has adopted as its school and [[Pipe band|Pipes and Drums]] uniform, the [[Black Watch]] [[Tartan]] of the [[Royal Highland Regiment]]. P.L.C was granted permission to wear the tartan after its brother school, [[The Scots College]], were issued a [[royal decree]] allowing them to use Black Watch as their Pipes & Drums and [[Cadets]] uniform. This tartan was carefully chosen by the school, as the 1958 ''Aurora Australis'' (the school [[yearbook]]) explained: "the tartan of the Black Watch, the oldest of the highland regiments. This tartan was specially designed for the regiment to prevent the jealousy which would have been aroused, if any existing clan tartan had been used."<ref name="Aurora1958">{{Citation | title=Tartan of the Black Watch | newspaper=Aurora Australis: The Magazine of the Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney | year=1958}}</ref>

== House system ==
The [[house system]] was established by Dr. John Marden shortly after the opening of the school, and consisted of three houses: East, West and Boarders. In 1924 the senior houses were re-organised and renamed Kinross, Harper and Ferguson (with Anderson added in 1968), followed in 1926 by the introduction of junior houses, named Vicars and [[Ewen Neil McQueen|McQueen]] (with Thompson added in 1937).<ref name="GH65">{{cite book| last = McFarlane| first = John| title = The Golden Hope: Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney 1888-1988| year = 1988| pages = pp. 65 & 138}}</ref>  
1979 saw the school move to four houses from primary to secondary, and thus the junior houses disappeared.<ref name="GH65"/> 
Finally, 1995 saw the introduction of two new houses named Pickard and Wilkie. The Houses are named after women and men who have made a significant contribution to the life of the College.<ref name=PLCHouses/>

She was a foundation member of the Committee of the Ex-Students' Union in 1906, then President (1927&ndash;1932), and Patroness from 1936. In 1932 she petitioned the Assembly for the appointment of women to the P.L.C Council. Anderson was a member of the Council (1932&ndash;1958), and a benefactor to the College all her life.<ref name=PLCHouses>{{cite web |url=http://www.plc.nsw.edu.au/public2/house_system.asp |title=House System |accessdate=2007-04-23 |work=History |publisher=Presbyterian Ladies' College}}</ref>

;Harper
[[Andrew Harper|Rev. Dr Andrew Harper]] (1844&ndash;1936) was the third Principal of [[Presbyterian Ladies' College, Melbourne|P.L.C Melbourne]] (1879&ndash;1888). He then lectured at [[Ormond College (University of Melbourne)|Ormond Theological College]], [[Melbourne, Victoria|Melbourne]] before coming to Sydney, where he was Principal of St Andrew's Theological College (1902&ndash;1923). He was Chairman of P.L.C Council from 1907 until 1913.<ref name=PLCHouses/>  

;Kinross
Rev. Dr John Kinross (1833&ndash;1908) was a Presbyterian minister at [[Kiama, New South Wales|Kiama]] (1858&ndash;1875). He then became Principal of St Andrew's Theological College from 1875 until 1901, and Chairman of P.L.C Council from 1888 until 1906.<ref name=Kinross>{{cite web |url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A050040b.htmoffset=0&place_seq=2396 |title=Kinross, John (1833 - 1908) |accessdate=2007-04-23 |last=Dougan |first=Alan |year=1974 |work=Australian Dictionary of Biography |publisher= Melbourne University Press |pages=pp. 33&ndash;34}}</ref><ref name=PLCHouses/> 

;Pickard
Marion Pickard was appointed to the College as a teaching governess in June 1888. She was Lady [[Superintendent (education)|Superintendent]] from 1894 until her resignation in 1907. In 1905 Pickard was elected the first President of the Ex-Students' Union.<ref name=PLCHouses/>  

;Wilkie
Dr Helen Wilkie (1895&ndash;1984), was the second Headmistress at [[Presbyterian Ladies' College, Armidale|P.L.C Armidale]] (1938&ndash;1941), and then the fourth Principal of P.L.C Sydney (1942&ndash;1946). On her appointment to Croydon she was immediately confronted with the takeover by the [[Royal Australian Air Force|RAAF]], and organised the move of the College to Strathfield.<ref name=PLCHouses/>   

==Ex-Students' Union==
'''The Ex-Students' Union''' is the school's [[alumni association]]. It was [[Inauguration|inaugurated]] on the evening of [[9 December]] [[1905]], when at the invitation of Dr. Marden, several former students discussed the proposal, elected as their President the then Lady [[Superintendent (education)|Superintendent]], Marion Pickard, and formed a committee to produce a [[Constitution (corporate)|constitution]]. These were confirmed at a General Meeting on Jersey Day 1906, and the committee took office until 1907. 
At its foundation, the main objective of the union was to:{{Ref_label|d|d|none}} "be the accumulation of a special fund to be devoted to the erection of a [[chapel]] and library at the College, and an Ex-Students' prize to be awarded annually to the girl most proficient in work and sport."<ref name="GH312">{{cite book| last = McFarlane| first = John| title = The Golden Hope: Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney 1888-1988| year = 1988| pages = pp. 312&ndash;317| chapter =The Ex-Students' Union}}</ref>

The Union achieved much in its first few years, renting a building in the [[Sydney central business district|CBD]] to serve as a club and committee meeting place, making garments for [[hospital]]s, visiting [[Kindergarten]]s, the [[YWCA]], Home of Peace, Infants' Home and the [[Royal Institute for Deaf and Blind Children]]. An Ex-Students' [[Orchestra]] and Dramatic Club were formed, and [[Tennis]] and [[Croquet]] matches were held between current and former pupils.<ref name="GH312"/>

In 1916 the Pymble College was opened and its first Ex-Students' expressed an interest in joining the Union. Subsequently a combined Union was formed, known as the P.L.C Croydon and Pymble Ex-Students' Union, and an Ex-Students' prize was established at Pymble on the same conditions as at Croydon.<ref name="GH312"/>

One of the Unions' most significant contributions to the school was planned following the death of Dr. Marden in 1924. With the desire to provide Marden with a "fitting and lasting memorial",<ref name="GH312"/> it was decided that a library, to be called the John Marden Memorial Library, should be built at the Croydon College. This building was opened by Mrs. Marden in 1927 and although no longer suitable as a library due its size, remains a treasured part of the school.<ref name="GH312"/>

In 1929, it was proposed that "Pymble students should form a separate Union"<ref name="GH312"/> and that an equitable division of Union funds should be undertaken. This explains the two separate groups that exist today, however it is still not uncommon for Pymble students to attend Croydon [[reunion]]s and events, particularly those in regional areas or interstate.<ref name="GH312"/>
