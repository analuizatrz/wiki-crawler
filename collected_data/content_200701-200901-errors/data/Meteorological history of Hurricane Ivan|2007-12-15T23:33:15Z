The '''meteorological history of Hurricane Ivan''', the longest tracked [[tropical cyclone]] of the [[2004 Atlantic hurricane season]], lasted from late August through late September. The hurricane developed from a [[tropical wave]] that moved off the coast of [[Africa]] on [[August 31]]. Tracking westward due to a [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]], favorable conditions allowed it to develop into Tropical Depression Nine on [[September 2]] in the deep tropical [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The cyclone gradually intensified until [[September 5]], when it underwent [[rapid deepening]] and reached Category 4 status on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]]; at the time Ivan was the southernmost [[tropical cyclone scales|major]] [[Atlantic hurricane|hurricane]] on record.

[[Hurricane Ivan|Ivan]] quickly weakened due to dry air, but it gradually reorganized, passing just south of [[Grenada]] as a major hurricane on [[September 7]]. The hurricane attained [[List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes|Category 5]] status in the central [[Caribbean Sea]]. Over the subsequent days its intensity fluctuated largely due to [[eye (cyclone)|eyewall replacement cycles]], and Ivan passed just south of [[Jamaica]], the [[Cayman Islands]], and western [[Cuba]] with winds at or slightly below Category 5 status. Turning northward and encountering unfavorable conditions, Ivan gradually weakened before making [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] just west of [[Gulf Shores, Alabama]] on [[September 16]] with winds of 120&nbsp;mph (195&nbsp;km/h). The cyclone quickly weakened to tropical depression status as it turned to the northeast, and Ivan transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]] on [[September 18]].

The remnant low of Ivan turned to the south and southwest, and after crossing [[Florida]] on [[September 21]] it began to reacquire tropical characteristics. It became a tropical depression again on [[September 22]] to the southeast of [[Louisiana]], and Ivan reached winds of 60&nbsp;mph (95&nbsp;km/h) before weakening and moving ashore along southwestern Louisiana as a tropical depression; the circulation of Ivan dissipated after crossing into [[Texas]] on [[September 25]]. The cyclone broke several intensity records, and its duration was the tenth longest on record for an Atlantic hurricane.

On [[August 31]], a large [[tropical wave]] moved off the west coast of [[Africa]].

Low amounts of [[wind shear]] and favorable outflow allowed vigorous deep convection to develop and persist near the center, and by 1800&nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] on [[September 2]] the system developed into Tropical Depression Nine about 450&nbsp;miles (730&nbsp;km) southwest of [[Praia|Praia, Cape Verde]].<ref name="tcr"/>

Upon being classified as a tropical cyclone, the depression was embedded within a deep easterly steering current provided by a [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] to its north.

While at major hurricane status, Ivan maintained very strong convection in its core with a well-defined eye.

After maintaining Category 5 status for about 12&nbsp;hours, Ivan began a steady weakening trend due to another eyewall replacement cycle until reaching winds of 140&nbsp;mph (225&nbsp;km/h) on [[September 10]]. Early next day, the hurricane reorganized as it reached winds just shy of Category 5 status. However, weakening occurred again due to an eyewall replacement cycle, and at 0330&nbsp;UTC on [[September 11]] Ivan passed 23&nbsp;miles (37&nbsp;km) south of [[Portland Point]], [[Jamaica]], its closest approach, with winds of 150&nbsp;mph (240&nbsp;km/h).<ref name="tcr"/> The hurricane was previously forecasted to make landfall on the island,<ref name="disc28"/> though the weakening and a turn to the west kept the strongest winds offshore;<ref name="tcr"/> the last-minute turn to the west was due to a mid-level high pressure system over the eastern [[Gulf of Mexico]].

After its eyewall became re-established Ivan attained Category 5 status for a third time early on [[September 13]]. Shortly thereafter, a trough created a weakness in the ridge to its north, causing the hurricane to turn to the northwest. The combination of the combination of enhanced outflow from the trough and very warm waters allowed Ivan to maintain Category 5 status for 30&nbsp;hours.

After entering the southern [[Gulf of Mexico]], Hurricane Ivan weakened to Category 4 status by 0600&nbsp;UTC on [[September 14]].

At around 0650&nbsp;UTC on [[September 16]], Hurricane Ivan made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] just west of [[Gulf Shores, Alabama]] with an intensity of 120&nbsp;mph (195&nbsp;km/h); the strongest winds occurred over a narrow area near the southern Alabama and western Florida border.<ref name="tcr"/>

Upon moving ashore, the National Hurricane Center expected the forward path of Ivan to be blocked, and accordingly forecasted the hurricane to stall in the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] before dissipating.<ref name="disc55"/> As the hurricane crossed [[Mobile Bay]] it turned to the north-northeast, and within twelve hours Ivan rapidly weakened to tropical storm status.<ref name="tcr"/> The circulation became less-defined,<ref name="disc59">{{cite web|author=Stewart|year=2004|title=Tropical Depression Ivan Discussion Fifty-Nine|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-10-20|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2004/dis/al092004.discus.059.shtml?}}</ref> and early on [[September 17]] the cyclone deteriorated into a tropical depression over northeastern Alabama. Ivan accelerated to the northeast ahead of an approaching cold front, dropping heavy rainfall along its path.
