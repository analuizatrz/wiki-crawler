'''Lethbridge''' is a city in the province of [[Alberta]], [[Canada]]. It is Alberta's fourth largest city by population after [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]], and [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]]. At 127.19 km² (49.1 sq. mi.), it is the third largest in area after Calgary and Edmonton. The city is near the [[Canadian Rockies]], which provides the city with mild winters and a [[Chinook wind|windy climate]], and is 210 km (130 miles) southeast of Calgary on the [[Oldman River]]. 

The city developed from [[Drift mining|drift mines]] opened in the late [[19th century]] and [[agriculture]] in the early [[20th century]]. It has grown into the commercial, financial, transportational and industrial centre of [[southern Alberta]]. Lethbridge provides the only [[Higher education|post-secondary education]] south of Calgary and west of [[Medicine Hat, Alberta|Medicine Hat]]. There is a large cultural environment in the city, including performing arts, museums and sports.

==History==
{{main|History of Lethbridge}}

After the US Army outlawed alcohol trading in 1869 with the [[Blackfeet Indian Reservation|Blackfeet Nation]] in Montana, traders [[John Healy|John J. Healy]] and [[Alfred Hamilton|Alfred B. Hamilton]] started the whiskey trading post Fort Hamilton, which later came to be nicknamed [[Fort Whoop-Up]].<ref name=Ellis>{{cite web| url=http://www.lethbridge.ca/home/Enjoying+Lethbridge/Picture+Gallery/Short+History.htm |title=A Short History of Lethbridge, Alberta| author=Greg Ellis |month=October |year=2001|accessdate=2007-01-17}}</ref>

The whiskey trade eventually lead to the [[Cypress Hills massacre]] of many [[Assiniboine]] Indians in 1873. As a result, the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|North West Mounted Police]] were sent to the area to stop the trade and establish order.<ref name=Ellis/> The NWMP arrived at Fort Whoop-Up on 9 October 1874. For the next twelve years, the fort continued to trade and host a NWMP post.

The city developed from drift mines opened by [[Nicholas Sheran]] ([[1874]]) and the [[North Western Coal and Navigation Company]] ([[1882]]), whose president was [[William Lethbridge]], from whom the city derives its name.

The first rail line was built in Lethbridge, being completed 28 August 1885 by the [[Alberta Railway and Coal Company]]. Because of the rail industry's dependence of coal and the CPR's immigration efforts to settle southern Alberta, Lethbridge became instrumental in the economic success of the region. In the mid-1980s, the rail yards in downtown Lethbridge were moved to nearby [[Kipp, Alberta|Kipp]] and Lethbridge ceased operating as a hub for rail traffic in the province.

==Government==
{{See also|Lethbridge City Council}}

[[Image:Lethbridge City Hall.jpg|thumb|left|Lethbridge City Hall]]
Lethbridge's local government consists of 8 elected councillors, who along with the [[List of mayors of Lethbridge, Alberta|mayor]], make up the [[Lethbridge City Council]]. Lethbridge elects a new government every three years, in October. The City of Lethbridge has an operating budget of [[Canadian dollar|C$]]200 million, more than half of which is received through property taxation.<ref>[http://www.lethbridge.ca/NR/rdonlyres/DDEC3079-A129-49FD-AF56-EAB1E41CBDEB/4462/BudgetPresentation0608BudgetOverview.pdf 2006–2008 Preliminary Operating Budget Overview], City of Lethbridge</ref>

Lethbridgites elect representatives to the federal, provincial, and municipal levels of government. One Member of Parliament (MPs) representing [[Lethbridge (electoral district)|Lethbridge]] sits in the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]] in [[Ottawa]], and another 2 Members of Alberta's [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|legislative assembly]] (MLAs), representing [[Lethbridge East]] and [[Lethbridge West]], sit in the Legislative Assembly in Edmonton. Being Alberta's fourth most populous city, many provincial offices are located in the city.

[[Image:Lethbridge map.gif|thumb|left|200px|Map of Lethbridge]]

Lethbridge is split into three geographical areas: north, south and west. West Lethbridge is separated from the other two by the [[Oldman River]]. North and South Lethbridge are separated by the [[Crowsnest Highway]] and the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CPR]] rail line.

The newest of the three neighbourhoods, West Lethbridge (pop. 27,154)<ref name=2006-pop>[http://www.lethbridge.ca/NR/rdonlyres/C86CA863-3BDA-4D96-AD15-CCC9BC56C934/5794/MEDIARELEASECensusResults2006.pdf City of Lethbridge], "Lethbridge Census 2006 - City population up 1.96% per cent since 2005", 25 May 2006</ref> is home to the [[University of Lethbridge]]. The bulk of the city's growth since the early [[1990s]] has been on the west side. It also has the youngest population of the three.

The north side (pop. 23,241)<ref name=2006-pop/> was originally populated as a result of numerous coal mines in the area. It has the oldest population of the three neighbourhoods and is home to multiple industrial parks.

South Lethbridge (pop. 28,318)<ref name=2006-pop/> is the commercial heart of the city. It contains the [[Downtown Lethbridge|downtown core]], as well as the bulk of retail and hospitality establishments. [[Lethbridge Community College]] is also located here.

===Climate===
Lethbridge has a moderate continental climate with an average maximum temperature of 12.3 °C (54.14 °F) and an average minimum temperature of -1 °C (30.2 °F). With roughly 2400 hours of sunshine per year, Lethbridge is one of the sunniest cities in Canada. Average precipitation amounts to 386.3 mm (15.21 in). With an average wind speed of 18.20 km/h (11.31 mph), Lethbridge is the eighth windiest city in Canada;<ref name="winners">[http://www.on.ec.gc.ca/weather/winners/intro-e.html Weather Winners], Environment Canada. Accessed [[26 December]] [[2006]].</ref> it places second in the country for the most windy days of 40 km/h or more.<ref name="winners"/>

Lethbridge winters have the highest temperatures in the prairies.<ref name="chamber">[http://lethbridgechamber.com/community.php Community Profile], Lethbridge Chamber of Commerce. Accessed [[24 December]] [[2006]].</ref> Its relatively mild winters are a result of several geographical factors:<ref name="chamber"/>
* Close proximity to the Rocky Mountains protects it from strong northwest and southwest winds, often associated with blizzard conditions.
* High elevation (928.70 m)
* Frequent [[chinook wind|chinooks]]

The summers in Lethbridge are relatively cooler than most other locations in the prairies, also a result of its higher elevation.<ref name="bus-inv-profile">[http://www.chooselethbridge.ca/media/publication_1.pdf  Business Investment Profile 2005/2006], Economic Development Lethbridge. 2005.

==Major attractions==
[[Image:lethbridge_Viaduct.gif|thumb|right|High Level Bridge near downtown Lethbridge]]
The [[Lethbridge Viaduct]], commonly known as the ''High Level Bridge'', is the longest and tallest viaduct bridge in the world. Construction was completed in [[1909]] on what was then the western edge of the city.

[[Indian Battle Park]], located in the [[coulee]]s of the [[Oldman River]], commemorates the last battle between the [[Cree]] and the [[Blackfoot]] [[First Nations]] in [[1870]].

[[Nikka Yuko Japanese Garden]], located in south Lethbridge, was opened in [[1967]] in celebration for the Canadian centennial. It was a royal event with [[Japan]]’s Prince and Princess [[Prince Takamatsu|Takamatsu]] leading a list of special guests.

[[Image:Fort Whoop-Up.jpg|thumb|left|Fort-Whoop Up in Lethbridge]][[Fort Whoop-Up]] was also known as Fort Hamilton; during the late [[19th century|1800s]] it served as a centre for various illegal activities. Fort Whoop-Up was first built in [[1869]] by J.J. Healy and A.B. Hamilton with the purpose of being a whiskey post. Its first structure was destroyed by fire within a year of its construction — whether this was an accident or deliberate arson is unknown. A second, more sturdy structure later replaced Fort Whoop-Up. 

[[Galt Museum & Archives]] is the largest museum in the Lethbridge area. Its building once served as the main hospital in the city during the late 1800s and early [[20th century|1900s]]. It has an extensive collection of archives and hosts exhibits.

Nearly 100 years old, it is often displayed on tourist postcards and official city publications.

<!-- remove unsourced image [[Image:doingbusiness_thumb.gif|left|frame|Lethbridge Clock Tower]] -->Another prominent landmark is the [[Lethbridge Post Office|post office]]. While not as widely recognized as the High Level Bridge, it is one of the most unique buildings in Lethbridge, especially when compared to other buildings in southern Alberta. The four-storey building was built at the turn of the 20th century and is crowned by a functioning clock tower.

The remainder of prominent buildings in Lethbridge's [[Downtown Lethbridge|downtown]] skyline consist of several office towers.

In addition, some other prominent landmarks outside of downtown are the [[Lethbridge Water Tower|water tower]], which was originally built in 1958 and sold to a private developer who converted it into a restaurant, and the Alberta Terminals grain elevators.

The bus system is managed by [[Lethbridge Transit]].

The Parks and Recreation department maintains the city-wide, 30-kilometre, pedestrian/cyclist Coal Banks Trail system ([http://www.lethbridge.ca/NR/rdonlyres/12EB4100-4704-49B2-85B1-26053A428E37/733/Coal_Banks.pdf map]). The system was designed to connect the [[Oldman River]] valley with other areas of the city, including Pavan Park in the north, Henderson Lake in the east, [[Alberta provincial highway 4|highways 4]] and [[Alberta provincial highway 5|5]] in the south and a loop in West Lethbridge (including University Drive and McMaster Blvd).

Four provincial highways ([[Crowsnest Highway|3]], 4, 5, and [[Alberta provincial highway 25|25]]) run through or terminate in Lethbridge. This has led to the creation of major arterial roads (including Mayor Magrath Drive, University Drive and Scenic Drive). This, and the fact Lethbridge is located on the [[CANAMEX Corridor]], has led to Lethbridge being a major shipping destination, with many shipping lines having depots located in the city.<ref name="chamber"/>

Lethbridge is a short drive north from the [[United States]] border via highways 4 and 5; and a two hour drive (210 km) south of [[Calgary, Alberta]] via [[Alberta provincial highway 2|highways 2]] and 3. Highways 2, 3 and 4 form part of the [[CANAMEX]] trade route between [[Mexico]], the [[United States]], and Canada.

In addition to its road service, Lethbridge is very close to the [[Lethbridge County Airport]] and the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CPR]] rail yards in [[Kipp, Alberta|Kipp]]. The rail yards were moved to Kipp, just west of the city, from downtown Lethbridge in [[1983]] to make way for commercial expansion.<ref>[http://www.crowsnest-highway.ca/cgi-bin/citypage.pl?city=COALHURST Coalhurst, Alberta : History], The Virtual Crowsnest Highway. Accessed [[26 December]] [[2006]].</ref> The county airport provides commercial flights to several Alberta cities (such as [[Calgary, Alberta|Calgary]] and [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]]) and [[Mexico]], as well as private and charter flights to various other destinations. The airport also provides customs services for any flights coming in from the United States.
