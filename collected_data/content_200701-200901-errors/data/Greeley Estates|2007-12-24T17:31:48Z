==Biography==

Greeley Estates is one of [[PureVolume]]’s top 10 unsigned artists with over 1,300,000 plays&mdash;an accolade supported by having album sales in the top 10 on Smartpunk since October 2004. Their distribution record further secured them a position on the Smartpunk chart for “Sales of All Time.” They were on select dates of the [[Vans Warped Tour]] in 2005. Greeley Estates' work is featured on the Punk the Clock Vol. 1 & 2 compilations, along with artists such as [[Taking Back Sunday]], [[Acceptance (band)|Acceptance]], [[Mae]], and [[Underoath]]. They have also appeared on the 2005 Warped tour compilation.  The band also performed on the Hurley Stage for the entirety of the 2006 Vans Warped Tour.

In 2005, they signed to Record Collection and co-headlined the MySpace Fall Tour 2005.

Other accomplishments include: completing three US tours since November 2004, a DVD entitled "The Death of Greeley Estates" released in May 2005, playing on the [[Taste Of Chaos]] tour, and continual play on [[KEDJ]] 103.9 [[alternative rock]] radio in Phoenix. 

The original drummer for the band was Mike Coburn.  He left the band shortly before they started touring at the end of 2003. Brian Champ soon became the drummer for Greeley Estates.

The original bassist, Jared, left Greeley Estates before they began touring the US. Jared was then replaced by Josh Applebach.

On January 31, 2007, bassist Josh Applebach announced that he would leave Greeley Estates for a teaching career in Arizona. Bradley Murray (previously with [[Versus the Mirror]]) from [[Tucson]], [[Arizona]] became their touring bassist. His first live appearance with the band was on February 3, 2007 in [[Safford, Arizona|Safford]], [[Arizona]].

On June 3, 2007, lead guitar Dallas Smith announced he would be leaving the band in order to start up a family with his wife and expected twin daughters (he and his wife were to subsequently lose the pregnancy).  He made this announcement via a Myspace bulletin and announced that his last show would be June 20, 2007 at the Clubhouse in Tempe, Arizona.  

After their Mexican tour with Silverstein, Brad Murray left the band for personal reasons.

On September 4, 2007, Greeley Estates recorded their new album. The two new members of Greeley Estates include Alejondro Torres (previously with Eyes Set To Kill) and Joshua Ferguson (previously with Glory Nights).
