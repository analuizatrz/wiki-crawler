The term '''B movie''' originally referred to a [[film|motion picture]] made on a low or modest budget and intended for distribution as the less-publicized, bottom half of a [[double feature]] during the so-called [[Cinema of the United States#Golden Age of Hollywood|Golden Age of Hollywood]]. Although the U.S. production of movies intended as second features largely ceased by the end of the 1950s, the term ''B movie'' continues to be used in a broader sense, referring to any low-budget, commercial motion picture meant neither as an [[art film|arthouse film]] nor as [[pornography]]. In its post–Golden Age usage, there is ambiguity on both sides: on the one hand, many B movies display a high degree of craft and aesthetic ingenuity; on the other, the primary interest of many inexpensive [[exploitation film|exploitation]] movies is prurient. In some cases, both are true. 

In either usage, most B movies are representative of a particular [[genre]]—the [[Western (genre)|Western]] was a Golden Age B movie staple, while low-budget [[science-fiction]] and [[horror film|horror]] films became more popular in the 1950s. Early B movies were often part of series in which the star repeatedly played the same character. Almost always shorter than the top-billed films they were paired with, many had running times of 70 minutes or less. The term connoted a general perception that B movies were inferior to the more handsomely budgeted headliners; individual B films were often ignored by critics. Latter-day B movies still sometimes inspire multiple [[sequels]], but series are less common. As the average running time of A films has increased, so has that of B pictures. In its current usage, the term has two primary and somewhat contradictory connotations: it may be used to indicate an opinion that a certain movie is (a) a genre film with minimal artistic ambitions or (b) a lively, energetic film uninhibited by the constraints imposed on more expensive projects and unburdened by the conventions of putatively "serious" [[independent film]].

From their beginnings to the present day, B movies have been an important means of entry into the motion picture industry. Celebrated filmmakers such as [[Anthony Mann]] and [[Jonathan Demme]] learned their craft in B movies, which also gave émigré directors from Europe such as [[Douglas Sirk]] an opportunity to establish themselves in Hollywood. B movies are where actors such as [[Robert Mitchum]] and [[Jack Nicholson]] got their starts, and the B's have also provided work for former A-movie actors, such as [[Vincent Price]] and [[Karen Black]]. Some actors, such as [[Bela Lugosi]] and [[Sybil Danning]], worked in B movies for most of their careers. The terms '''drive-in movie''' and '''midnight movie''', which emerged in association with specific historical phenomena, are now roughly synonymous with ''B movie''. The terms '''C movie''' and '''Z movie''' describe progressively lower grades of films in the category. A more recently coined synonym is '''psychotronic movie'''.

==History==
===Roots of the B movie: 1920s===
[[Image:ThatCertainThing.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]]'s ''That Certain Thing'' (1928) was made for less than $20,000 and ran (silently) for about 69 minutes. The shine on its star, [[Viola Dana]], had faded since her glory days at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|Metro-Goldwyn]]. The film's director was contracted for $1,000; its success earned him a $1,500 bonus. Soon, [[Frank Capra]]'s association with Columbia would help vault the studio toward Hollywood's major leagues.<ref>Hirschhorn (1999), pp. 9–10, 17.</ref>]]
It is not clear that the term ''B movie'' (or ''B film'' or ''B picture'') was in general use before the 1930s, but a similar concept was already well established. In 1927–28, at the end of the [[silent film|silent era]], the production cost of an average feature from Hollywood's leading studios ranged from $190,000 at [[20th Century-Fox|Fox]] to $275,000 at [[MGM]]. That average reflected both "specials" that might cost as much as $1 million and films made quickly for around $50,000. These cheaper films allowed the studios to derive maximum value from facilities and contracted staff in between a studio's more important productions, while also breaking in new personnel.<ref>Finler (1988), p. 36; Balio (1995), p. 29.</ref> Studios in the minor leagues of the industry, such as [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[Film Booking Offices of America]] (FBO), focused on exactly those sort of cheap productions; their movies, with relatively short running times, targeted theaters that had to economize on rental and operating costs—particularly those in small towns and so-called neighborhood venues, or "nabes," in big cities. Even smaller, so-called [[Poverty Row]] outfits made films whose production costs might run as low as $3,000, seeking a profit through whatever bookings they could pick up in the gaps left by the larger concerns.<ref>See, e.g., Taves (1995), p. 320.</ref> 

With the widespread arrival of [[sound film]] in American theaters in 1929, many independent exhibitors began dropping the then-dominant presentation model, which involved live acts and a broad variety of [[short subject|shorts]] before a single featured film. A new programming scheme developed that would soon become standard practice: a [[newsreel]], a short and/or a [[movie serial|serial]], and a [[animated cartoon|cartoon]], followed by a double feature. The second feature, which actually screened before the main event, cost the exhibitor less per minute than the equivalent running time in shorts. The majors' "clearance" rules favoring their affiliated theaters prevented the independents' timely access to top-quality films; the second feature allowed them to promote quantity instead.<ref>Balio (1995), p. 29. The majors' comprehensive booking policy was known in full as the ''run-zone-clearance'' system. As Schatz (1999) describes, the system as of 1940 (and for many years previously) "sent a picture, after playing in the lucrative first-run arena, through the 16,000 'subsequent-run' movie houses; 'clearance' refers to the amount of time between runs, and 'zone' refers to the specific areas in which a film played. Typically, a top feature would play in its second run in smaller downtown theaters [many major-affiliated] and then move steadily outward from the urban centers to the suburbs, then to smaller cities and towns, and finally to rural communities, playing in ever smaller (and less profitable) venues and taking upwards of six months to complete its run" (p. 16). See also p. 324 for specific applications of "clearance."</ref> The B movie also gave the program "balance"—the practice of pairing different sorts of features suggested to potential customers that they could count on something of interest no matter what specifically was on the bill. As the president of one Poverty Row company would later put it, "Not everybody likes to eat cake. Some people like bread, and even a certain number of people like stale bread rather than fresh bread."<ref>Steve Broidy, president of Monogram/Allied Artists, quoted in Schatz (1999), p. 75.</ref> The low-budget picture of the 1920s naturally transformed into the second feature, the B movie, of the 1930s and 1940s—the most reliable bread of Hollywood's Golden Age.

===B's in the Golden Age of Hollywood (1): 1930s===
[[Image:LadiesCravePoster.jpg|thumb|left|250px|It was from small Mascot Pictures, but ''Ladies Crave Excitement'' (1935) still packed "Bursting Action, Deep Drama...And Up To Date Romance" into its 73 minutes. [[Film editing|Supervising editor]] [[Joseph H. Lewis]] would soon become a prolific director of B Westerns. His later [[film noirs]], including the independently produced ''[[Gun Crazy]]'' (1949), would become renowned.]]
The [[studio system|major studios]], at first resistant to the B feature, soon adapted. All ultimately established "B units" to provide films for the expanding second-feature market.  The technique known as ''block booking'' became standard practice: in order to get access to a studio's attractive A pictures, many theaters were obliged to rent the company's entire output for a season. With the B films rented at a flat fee (rather than the box office percentage basis of A films), rates could be set that essentially guaranteed the profitability of every B movie. The parallel practice of ''blind bidding'' meant that the majors didn't have to worry over much about the quality of their B's—even when booking in less than seasonal blocks, exhibitors had to buy most pictures sight unseen. The five largest studios—[[MGM]], [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], [[20th Century-Fox|Fox]], [[Warner Bros.]], and [[RKO]] (descendant of FBO)—had the additional advantage of being part of companies that also owned sizable theater chains, further securing the bottom line. Poverty Row studios, from modest outfits like Mascot Pictures and Sono Art–World Wide on down to shoestring operations, made exclusively B movies, serials, and other shorts; they also distributed totally independent productions and imported films. These studios were in no position to directly block book; instead, they mostly sold regional distribution exclusivity to "states rights" distributors, who would in turn peddle blocks of films to exhibitors, typically six or more movies featuring the same star (a relative status on Poverty Row).<ref>Taves (1995), pp. 326–327.</ref> Two studios in the middle—the "major-minors" [[Universal Studios|Universal]] and Columbia, moving up in rank—had production lines roughly similar to the top Poverty Row concerns, if somewhat better endowed in general, and with a few up-market productions each year as well. They had few or no theaters, but they did have major-league-level distribution exchanges.<ref>See, e.g., Balio (1995), pp. 103–104.</ref>

In the model that would be standard during the Golden Age, the industry's top product, its A films, would premiere at a select number of first-run houses in major cities, virtually all of them owned by the five largest studios, the so-called Big Five. Across North America, there were approximately 450 first-run houses, divided among the majors; a movie that headlined its first week on 100 screens was having a grand opening. Double features, though sometimes employed, were never the rule at these prestigious venues. As described by historian Edward Jay Epstein, "During these first runs, films got their reviews, garnered publicity, and generated the word of mouth that served as the principal form of advertising."<ref>Epstein (2005), p. 6. See also Schatz (1999), pp. 16–17.</ref> Then it was off to the nabes and the hinterland, the subsequent-run market where the double feature prevailed. At the larger local venues controlled by the majors, movies might turn over on a weekly basis. At the thousands of small theaters that belonged to independent chains or were individually owned, programs often changed two or three time a week, sometimes even faster. To keep up with the constant demand for new B product, the low end of Poverty Row turned out a stream of micro-budget movies rarely much more than sixty minutes long; these were known as "quickies" for their tight production schedules—a week's shooting was about average, just four days was not unheard of.<ref>Taves (1995), p. 325.</ref> As historian Brain Taves describes, "Many of the poorest theaters, such as the 'grind houses' in the larger cities, screened a continuous program emphasizing action with no specific schedule, sometimes offering six quickies for a nickel in all-night show that changed daily."<ref>Taves (1995), p. 326.</ref> Many small theaters never saw a big-studio A film, getting their movies from the states rights concerns that handled almost exclusively Poverty Row product. Millions of Americans went to their local theaters as a matter of course: for an A picture, along with the [[Trailer (film)|trailers]], or screen previews, that had presaged its arrival, "[t]he new film's title on the marquee and the listings for it in the local newspaper constituted all the advertising most movies got."<ref>Epstein (2005), p. 4.</ref> Aside from at the theater itself, B films might not be advertised at all.

The introduction of sound had driven costs higher. In 1930, the beginning of the Golden Age's first full decade, the average U.S. feature film cost $375,000 to produce.<ref>Finler (1988), p. 36.</ref> A broad range of Hollywood motion pictures occupied the B-movie category: The leading studios made not only clear-cut A and B films, but also movies classifiable as "programmers" (also "in-betweeners" or "intermediates"). These were films that "straddle[d] the A-B boundary," in Taves's description. During the era of the double feature, "[d]epending on the prestige of the theater and the other material on the double bill, a programmer could show up at the top or bottom of the marquee."<ref>Taves (1995), p. 317. Taves (like this article) adopts the usage of "programmer" argued for by author Don Miller in his 1973 study ''B Movies'' (New York: Ballantine). As Taves notes, "the term ''programmer'' was used in a variety of different ways by reviewers" of the 1930s (p. 431, n. 8). Some present-day critics employ the Miller–Taves usage; others refer to any B movie from the Golden Age as a "programmer" or "program picture."</ref> On Poverty Row, many B's were made on budgets that would have barely covered petty cash on a major's A film, with costs at the bottom of the industry running as low as $5,000.<ref>Taves (1995), p. 325.</ref> By the middle of the 1930s, the double feature was the dominant exhibition model across the country, and the majors responded. In 1935, B-movie production at Warner Bros. was raised from 12 to 50 percent of the studio's total output. The unit was headed by Bryan Foy, known as the "Keeper of the B's."<ref>Balio (1995), p. 102.</ref> At Fox, which also shifted half of its production line into B territory, Sol Wurtzel was similarly in charge of more than twenty movies a year during the late 1930s.

[[Republic Pictures]]' ''Pals of the Saddle'' (1938) lasts just 55 minutes, perfectly average for a Three Mesquiteers adventure.]]
A number of the top Poverty Row firms were consolidating: Sono Art joined with another company to create [[Monogram Pictures]] early in the decade. In 1935, Monogram, Mascot, and several smaller studios merged to form [[Republic Pictures]]. After little more than a year, the heads of Monogram pulled out and revived their company. Into the 1950s, Republic and Monogram released films that tended to be roughly on par with the low end of the majors' output. Less sturdy Poverty Row concerns—with a penchant for grand sobriquets like Conquest, Empire, Imperial, and Peerless—continued to churn out dirt-cheap quickies.<ref>See Taves (1995), pp. 321–329.</ref> Joel Finler has analyzed the average length of feature film releases from the various Hollywood studios in 1938, which indicates the degree to which each emphasized the production of B films ([[United Artists]] directly produced no features, focusing instead on the distribution of prestigious films made by independent outfits):<ref>Adapted from Finler (1988), pp. 21–22.</ref>

Taves estimates that half of the films produced by the eight majors in the 1930s were B movies. Calculating in the three hundred or so films made annually by the many Poverty Row firms, approximately 75 percent of Hollywood movies from the decade, more than four thousand pictures, are classifiable as B's.<ref>Taves (1995), p. 313.</ref> Outside of the highly standardized realm of the series picture, studio executives saw developmental opportunities in their B lines of production. In 1937, RKO production chief Sam Briskin described his company's B films as "a testing ground for new names, and experiments in story and treatment."<ref>Quoted in Lasky (1989), p. 142.</ref>

The Western was by far the predominant B genre in both the 1930s and, to a somewhat lesser degree, the 1940s; for most of the Golden Age, Westerns of every stripe accounted for 25 to 30 percent of all Hollywood feature production.<ref>Nachbar (1974), p. 2.</ref> Film historian Jon Tuska has argued that "the 'B' product of the Thirties—the Universal films with [[Tom Mix|[Tom] Mix]], [[Ken Maynard|[Ken] Maynard]], and [[Buck Jones|[Buck] Jones]], the Columbia features with Buck Jones and [[Tim McCoy]], the RKO [[George O'Brien (actor)|George O'Brien]] series, the Republic Westerns with [[John Wayne]] and the Three Mesquiteers...achieved a uniquely American perfection of the well-made story."<ref>Tuska (1974), p. 37.</ref> At the far end of the industry, Poverty Row's Ajax put out oaters starring [[Harry Carey]], then in his fifties. The Weiss outfit had the Range Rider series, the American Rough Rider series, and the Morton of the Mounted "northwest action thrillers" that gave top billing to Dynamite, the Wonder Horse and Captain, the King of Dogs.<ref>Taves (1995), p. 327–328.</ref> One notable low-budget oater of the era, produced totally outside of the studio system, made money off an outrageous concept: a Western with an all-midget cast, ''[[The Terror of Tiny Town]]'' (1938) was such a success in its independent bookings that Columbia picked it up for distribution.<ref>Taves (1995), p. 316.</ref>

Series of various genres were particularly popular during the first decade of sound film. At just one major studio, Fox, B series included "[[Charlie Chan]], [[Mr. Moto]], [[Sherlock Holmes]], Michael Shayne, the [[Cisco Kid]], George O'Brien Westerns [before his move to RKO], the Gambini sports films, the Roving Reporters, the Camera Daredevils, the Big Town Girls, the hotel for women, the Jones Family, the [[Jane Withers]] children's films, [[Jeeves]], [and] the [[Ritz Brothers]]."<ref>Taves (1995), p. 318.</ref> These feature-length series films are not to be confused with the short, [[cliffhanger]]-structured serials that sometimes appeared on the same program. As with serials, however, many series were specifically intended to interest young people—some of the theaters that twin-billed part-time might run a "balanced" or entirely youth-oriented double feature as a matinee and then a single film for a more mature audience at night. In the words of a contemporary [[George Gallup|Gallup]] industry report, afternoon moviegoers, "composed largely of housewives and children, want quantity for their money while the evening crowds want 'something good and not too much of it.'"<ref>Quoted in Schatz (1999), p. 75.</ref> Series films are often unquestioningly consigned to the B-movie category, but even here there is ambiguity:
<blockquote>
[T]he most profitable B pictures functioned much like the comic strips in the daily newspapers, showing the continuing adventures of [[Roy Rogers]] [Republic], [[Boston Blackie]] [Columbia], the [[Dead End Kids|Bowery Boys]] [Warner Bros./Universal], [[Blondie (film)|Blondie and Dagwood]] [Columbia], Charlie Chan [Fox/Monogram], and so on. Even a major studio like MGM [the industry leader from 1931 through 1941] was equipped with a so-called B unit that specialized in these serial [''sic''] productions. At MGM, however, the [[Andy Hardy]], Dr. Kildaire, and [[The Thin Man (film)|Thin Man]] films were made with major stars and with what some organizations would have considered A budgets.<ref>Naremore (1998), p. 141.</ref>
</blockquote>
For some series, of course, even a major studio's B budget was far out of reach: Poverty Row's Consolidated Pictures, backed by Weiss, featured Tarzan, the Police Dog in a series with the proud name of Melodramatic Dog Features.<ref>Taves (1995), p. 328.</ref>

Director [[Phil Karlson]] would go on to direct several exceptionally tough noirs in the next decade. Lead and producer [[Kay Francis]] had been a major star in the 1930s. This was her last movie.]]
By 1940, the average production cost of an American feature was $400,000, a negligible increase over ten years.<ref>Finler (1988), p. 36.</ref> A number of small Hollywood companies had folded around the turn of the decade, including the ambitious Grand National, but a new firm, [[Producers Releasing Corporation]] (PRC), emerged as third in the Poverty Row hierarchy behind Republic and Monogram. The double feature, never universal, was still the prevailing exhibition model: in 1941, 50 percent of theaters were double-billing exclusively, with additional numbers screening under the policy part-time.<ref>Schatz (1999), p. 73.</ref> In the early 1940s, legal pressure forced the studios to replace seasonal block booking with packages generally limited to five pictures (MGM carried on with blocks of twelve for a while). Restrictions were also placed on the majors' ability to enforce blind bidding.<ref>Schatz (1999), pp. 19–21, 45, 72, 160–163. See also Taves (1995), pp. 314–315.</ref> These were crucial factors in the progressive shift by most of the Big Five over to A-film production, making the smaller studios even more important as B-movie suppliers. In 1944, for instance, MGM, Paramount, Fox, and Warners released a total of 95 features: 14 had B-level budgets of $200,000 or less; 11 were budgeted between $200,000 and $500,000, a range encompassing programmers as well as straight B movies on the lower end; and 70 were A budgeted at $0.5 million or more.<ref>Analysis based on Schatz (1999), p. 173, table 6.3.</ref> Genre pictures made at very low cost remained the backbone of Poverty Row, with even Republic's and Monogram's budgets rarely climbing over $200,000. According to scholar James Naremore, between 1945 and 1950, "the average B western from Republic Pictures was made for about $50,000."<ref>Naremore (1998), p. 140.</ref> Among the established studios, Monogram was exploring fresh territory with what were being called "[[exploitation film|exploitation pictures]]." ''[[Variety]]'' defined these as "films with some timely or currently controversial subject which can be exploited, capitalized on in publicity or advertising."<ref>Quoted in Schatz (1999), p. 175.</ref> Many smaller Poverty Row firms were folding because there simply wasn't enough money to go around: the eight majors, with their proprietary distribution exchanges, were now "taking in around 95 percent of all domestic (U.S. and Canada) rental receipts."<ref>Schatz (1999), p. 16.</ref>

Referencing the work of historian Lea Jacobs, Naremore describes how the line between A and B movies was "ambiguous and never dependent on money alone."<ref>Naremore (1998), p. 141.</ref> Films shot on B-level budgets were occasionally marketed as A pictures or emerged as [[sleeper hit]]s: One of 1943's biggest films was ''Hitler's Children'', an 82-minute-long RKO thriller made for a fraction over $200,000. It earned more than $3 million in rentals, industry language for a distributor's share of gross [[box office]] receipts.<ref>Jewell (1982), 181; Lasky (1989), 184–185.</ref> The graphically violent ''[[Dillinger (1945 film)|Dillinger]]'' (1945) earned Monogram more than $1 million for the first time.<ref>Schatz (1999), p. 175.</ref> A pictures, particularly in the realm of [[film noir]], sometimes echoed visual styles generally associated with cheaper films. Programmers, with their flexible exhibition role, were ambiguous by definition, leading in certain cases to historical confusion. [[Ronald Reagan]], frequently identified as a "B-movie star," in fact often had leading parts not only in programmers but also run-of-the-mill A movies that were B's only in the sense of perceived aesthetic quality. As late as 1948, the double feature remained a popular exhibition mode—it was the standard screening policy at 25 percent of theaters and used part-time at an additional 36 percent.<ref>Schatz (1999), p. 78.</ref> The leading Poverty Row firms began to broaden their scope: In 1947, Monogram established a subsidiary, Allied Artists, as a development and distribution channel for relatively expensive films, mostly from independent producers. Around the same time, Republic launched a similar effort under the "Premiere" rubric.<ref>Schatz (1999), pp. 340–341.</ref> In 1947 as well, PRC was subsumed by [[Eagle-Lion Films|Eagle-Lion]], a British company seeking entry to the American market. Warners' former Keeper of the B's, Brian Foy, was installed as production chief.<ref>Schatz (1999), p. 295; Naremore (1998), p. 142; [http://www.searchmytrash.com/articles/prc(8-05).shtml PRC (Producers Releasing Corporation)] essay by Mike Haberfelner, August 2005; part of the ''(re)Search my Trash'' website. Retrieved 12/30/06.</ref>

In the 1940s, RKO—the weakest of the Big Five throughout its history—stood out among the industry's largest companies for its focus on B pictures. From a latter-day perspective, the most famous of the major studios' Golden Age B units is [[Val Lewton]]'s horror unit at RKO. Lewton produced such moody, mysterious films as ''[[Cat People (1942 film)|Cat People]]'' (1942), ''[[I Walked with a Zombie]]'' (1943), and ''[[The Body Snatcher (film)|The Body Snatcher]]'' (1945), directed by [[Jacques Tourneur]], [[Robert Wise]], and others who would become renowned only later in their careers or entirely in retrospect. The movie now widely described as the first classic film noir—''[[Stranger on the Third Floor]]'' (1940), a 64-minute B—was produced at RKO, which would release many additional melodramatic thrillers in a similarly stylish vein during the decade. The other major studios also turned out a considerable number of movies now identified as noir during the 1940s. Though many of the best-known film noirs were well-financed productions—the majority of Warner Bros. noirs, for instance, were produced at the studio's A level—most 1940s pictures in the mode were either of the ambiguous programmer type or destined straight for the bottom of the bill. In the decades since, these cheap entertainments, generally dismissed at the time, have become some of the most treasured products of Hollywood's Golden Age among aficionados.<ref>See, e.g., Dave Kehr, "Critic's Choice: New DVD's," ''New York Times'', August 22, 2006; Dave Kehr, "Critic's Choice: New DVD's," ''New York Times'', June 7, 2005; Robert Sklar, "Film Noir Lite: When Actions Have No Consequences," ''New York Times'', "Week in Review," June 2, 2002.</ref> 
[[Image:RawDealPoster2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[Raw Deal (1948 film)|Raw Deal]]'', a 1948 [[film noir]], was put out by Poverty Row's [[Eagle-Lion Films|Eagle-Lion]] firm. Such movies were routinely marketed as pure sensationalism, but many noirs were also works of great visual beauty. Directed by [[Anthony Mann]] and [[cinematography|shot]] by [[John Alton]], ''Raw Deal'' "is resplendent with velvety blacks, mists, netting, and other expressive accessories of poetic noir decor and lighting."<ref>Robert Smith, "Mann in the Dark," quoted in Ottoson (1981), p. 145.</ref>]]
In one sample year, 1947, RKO produced in addition to several noir programmers and A pictures, two straight B noirs: ''[[Desperate (film)|Desperate]]'', directed by [[Anthony Mann]], and ''The Devil Thumbs a Ride'', directed by Felix Feist. Ten straight B noirs that year came from Poverty Row's big three: Republic (''Blackmail'' and ''The Pretender''), Monogram (''Fall Guy'', ''The Guilty'', ''High Tide'', and ''Violence''), and PRC/Eagle-Lion (''Bury Me Dead'', ''Lighthouse'', ''Whispering City'', and ''[[Railroaded]]'', another work of Mann). One came from tiny Screen Guild (''Shoot to Kill''). Three majors beside RKO also contributed: Columbia (''Blind Spot'' and ''[[Framed (film)|Framed]]''), Paramount (''[[Fear in the Night]]''), and 20th Century-Fox (''Backlash'' and ''[[The Brasher Doubloon]]''). Adding programmers to that list of eighteen would bring it to around thirty. Still, most of the majors' low-budget production during the decade was of the sort now largely ignored. RKO's representative output included the [[Lupe Vélez|Mexican Spitfire]] and [[Lum and Abner]] comedy series, thrillers featuring the [[Simon Templar|Saint]] and the [[The Falcon (literary character)|Falcon]], Westerns starring [[Tim Holt]], and [[Tarzan]] movies with [[Johnny Weissmuller]]. [[Jean Hersholt]] played Dr. Christian in six films between 1939 and 1941. ''The Courageous Dr. Christian'' (1940) is representative: "In the course of an hour or so of screen time, the saintly physician managed to cure an epidemic of spinal meningitis, demonstrate benevolence towards the disenfranchised, set an example for wayward youth, and calm the passions of an amorous old maid."<ref>Jewell (1982), p. 147.</ref> 

Down in Poverty Row, low budgets led to less palliative fare. Republic aspired to major-league respectability while making lots of cheap and modestly budgeted Westerns, but there wasn't much from the bigger studios that compared with Monogram "exploitation pictures" like [[juvenile delinquency]] [[exposé]] ''Where Are Your Children?'' (1943) and the prison film ''Women in Bondage'' (1943).<ref>Schatz (1999), p. 175.</ref> In 1947, PRC's ''The Devil on Wheels'' brought together teenagers, [[hot rods]], and death.

===Transition I/The B movie in the television age: 1950s===
In 1948, a Supreme Court ruling in a [[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.|federal antitrust suit against the majors]] outlawed block booking and led to the Big Five divesting their theater chains over the next few years. With audiences draining away to television and other economic pressures forcing the studios to scale back production schedules, the first-run double feature began disappearing from American theaters over the course of the 1950s. After barely inching forward in the 1930s, the average U.S. feature production cost had essentially doubled over the 1940s, reaching $1 million by the turn of the decade (the increase from 1940 to 1950 was 150 percent in simple terms, 93 percent after adjusting for inflation).<ref>Finler (1988), p. 36.</ref> The major studios promoted the benefits of recycling, offering former headlining movies as second features in the place of traditional B films.<ref>Strawn (1974), p. 257.</ref> (Their longer running time appears to have both accommodated and hastened the progressive abandonment of the traditional "variety program" of newsreel/cartoon/short preceding the feature presentations at many theaters.) With television airing many classic Westerns as well as producing its own original Western series, the cinematic market for B oaters in particular was drying up.
[[Image:Thekettles1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''[[Ma and Pa Kettle|The Kettles on Old MacDonald's Farm]]'' (1957), from [[Universal]], was the final installment of the last B series put out by a major studio.]]
The first prominent victim of the changing market was Eagle-Lion, which released its last films in 1951. By 1953, the old Monogram brand had disappeared, the company having adopted the identity of its higher-end subsidiary, Allied Artists. The following year, Allied released Hollywood's last two B series Westerns, starring [[Wayne Morris]]: ''The Desperado'' in June and ''Two Guns and a Badge'' in September.<ref>Loy (2004), pp. 9–10; Reid (2005b), pp. 53–54. As was not uncommon in series Westerns, Morris didn't play precisely the same character in the six B oaters he starred in for Allied Artists in 1953 and 1954. Even leaving aside the plots, the series nature of the films is evident from the credits: Vincent M. Fennelly produced all six pictures. Lewis D. Collins and Thomas Carr split directorial duties equally, each taking three. Daniel P. Ullman wrote four of the films. Three cinematographers each shot two of the films—in all three cases, one for each of the two directors. [http://www.imdb.com/list IMDb.com Power Search] performed 12/30/06.</ref> Non-series B Westerns would continue to come out for a few more years, but Republic Pictures, long associated with cheap sagebrush sagas, was out of the filmmaking business by the end of the decade. In other genres, Allied Artists kept its Bomba the Jungle Boy series going through 1955, while Universal maintained B series featuring [[Abbott and Costello]] (through 1955), [[Francis the Talking Mule]] (through 1956), and [[Ma and Pa Kettle]] (through 1957).<ref>Lev (2003), p. 205.</ref> RKO, weakened by what one studio historian describes as its "systematic seven-year rape" by former owner [[Howard Hughes]], exited the movie industry in 1957.<ref>Lasky (1989), p. 229.</ref> Hollywood's A product was getting longer—the top ten box-office releases of 1940 had averaged 112.5 minutes; the average length of 1955's top ten was 123.4.<ref>See Finler (1988), pp. 276–277, for top films. Finler lists ''[[The Country Girl (1954 film)|The Country Girl]]'' as 1955, when it made most of its money, but it premiered in December 1954. ''[[The Seven Year Itch]]'' replaces it in this analysis (the two films happen to be virtually identical in length).</ref> In their modest way, the B's were following suit. The age of the hour-long feature film was now past; at 69 minutes, ''Two Guns and a Badge'' was about as short as Hollywood features ran. In sum, the Golden Age–style second feature was dying. ''B movie'', however, continued to be used in a broader sense, referring to any low-budget genre film featuring relatively unheralded performers ("[[B-actor|B actors]]"). The term retained its earlier suggestion that such movies relied on formulaic plots, "stock" character types, and simplistic action or unsophisticated comedy. At the same time, the realm of the B movie was becoming increasingly fertile territory for experimentation, both serious and outlandish. 

[[Ida Lupino]], well known as an actress, established herself as Hollywood's sole female director of the era. In short, low-budget pictures made for the production company she ran with her husband [[Collier Young]], The Filmakers, Lupino explored virtually taboo subjects such as rape in 1950's ''[[Outrage (film)|Outrage]]'' (released by RKO) and 1953's self-explanatory ''The Bigamist'' (an entirely independent project). Her most famous directorial effort, ''[[The Hitch-Hiker (1953 film)|The Hitch-Hiker]]'' (1953), was another RKO release. Often referred to as the only classic film noir directed by a woman, it made a virtue of its small budget with an unusually intense focus on its three lead characters.<ref>See, e.g., Eddie Muller, ''Dark City: The Lost World of Film Noir'' (New York: St. Martin's, 1998), p. 176.</ref> That same year, RKO put out another historically notable film made at low cost and with an only faintly starry cast: the 85-minute-long ''Split Second'' comes to a head in a desert ghost town about to become a nuclear blast site, making it perhaps the first example of an "atomic noir." The most famous such movie, ''[[Kiss Me Deadly]]'' (1955), independently produced by Victor Saville and his Parklane Pictures company, typifies the persistently murky middle ground between the A and B picture. Film historian Richard Maltby identifies it as a "programmer capable of occupying either half of a neighbourhood theatre's double-bill [and] budgeted at approximately $400,000. [Its] distributor, United Artists, released around twenty-five programmers with production budgets between $100,000 and $400,000 in 1955. For UA, these movies served to spread the overhead costs of their distribution operation rather than to make profits in themselves."<ref>Maltby (2000).</ref> The film's length, 106 minutes, is A level, but its star, [[Ralph Meeker]], had previously appeared in only one major film. It is based on an unequivocally [[pulp magazine|pulpy]] source, one of [[Mickey Spillane]]'s [[Mike Hammer]] novels, but is directed in a self-consciously aestheticized fashion by [[Robert Aldrich]]. The result is a brutal genre picture that chillingly evokes contemporary anxieties about what was often spoken of simply as the Bomb.
[[Image:RocketshipXM2.jpg|thumb|right|285px|''[[Rocketship X-M]]'' (1950), produced and released by small Lippert Pictures, is cited as possibly "the first postnuclear holocaust film."<ref>Shapiro (2002), p. 96. See also [http://www.conelrad.com/conelrad100/index.html Atomic Films: The CONELRAD 100] part of the ''CONELRAD'' website.</ref> It was at the leading edge of a large cycle of movies, mostly low-budget and many long forgotten, classifiable as "atomic bomb cinema."]]
The fear of nuclear war with the Soviet Union, along with less expressible qualms about the effects of radioactive fallout from America's own atomic tests, energized many of the era's genre films. Science fiction, horror, and various hybrids of the two were now of central economic importance to the low-budget end of the business. Most down-market films of the type—like those produced by [[William Alland]] at Universal (e.g., ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]'' [1954]) and [[Sam Katzman]] at Columbia (e.g., ''[[Earth vs. the Flying Saucers]]'' [1956])—sought to provide no more than simple diversion. But these were genres whose fantastic nature could also be used as cover for mordant cultural observations often difficult to make in mainstream movies. Two well-financed films of 1951, ''[[The Thing from Another World]]'' and ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'', are often mentioned as vanguard examples, but scholar Richard Hodgens argues that they are beasts of a different sort: ''The Thing'' "proved that some money could be made by 'science fiction' that preyed on current fears symbolized crudely by any preposterous monster." Its fellow traveller was a thriller with a simplistic moral: "Earthlings, behave yourselves."<ref>Hodgens (1972), pp. 83, 84.</ref> The era's most provocative and unsettling fantasies were made for B-level money. Director [[Don Siegel]]'s ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956 film)|Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'' (1956), produced by [[Walter Wanger]] for $300,000 and released by Allied Artists, treats conformist pressures and the evil of banality in haunting, allegorical fashion.<ref>Lev (2003), pp. 186, 184; Braucort (1972), 75.</ref> A "''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' for the atomic age," ''[[The Amazing Colossal Man]]'' (1957), directed by [[Bert I. Gordon]], is both a monster movie that happens to depict the horrific effects of radiation exposure and "a ferocious cold-war fable [that] spins [[Korean War|Korea]], the army's obsessive secrecy, and America's post-war growth into one fantastic whole."<ref>Auty (1999), p. 24. See also Shapiro (2002), pp. 120–124.</ref>

''The Amazing Colossal Man'' was released by a new company whose name was much bigger than its budgets. [[American International Pictures]] (AIP), founded in 1956 by [[James H. Nicholson]] and [[Samuel Z. Arkoff]] in a reorganization of their American Releasing Corporation (ARC), soon became the leading U.S. studio devoted entirely to B-priced productions. American International helped keep the original-release double bill alive through paired packages of its films: these movies were low-budget, but the economic model was different from that of the traditional B movie—instead of a flat rate, they were rented out on a percentage basis, like A films.<ref>Strawn (1974), p. 259; Lev (2003), p. 206.</ref> ''[[I Was a Teenage Werewolf]]'' (1957) is perhaps the best known AIP film of the era. Guided by experienced genre writer-producer [[Herman Cohen]], the movie starred a twenty-year-old [[Michael Landon]]. As its title suggests, AIP sought audiences not only with fantastic genre subjects, but also with new, teen-oriented angles. One exemplary film, ''[[Daddy-O]]'' (aka ''Out on Probation''; 1958), sported the tagline "Alive!! With the Beat and the Heat of Today's Rock-N-Roll Generation!" If ''Hot Rod Gang'' (1958) worked, then why wouldn't hot rod horror? Result: ''Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow'' (1959). AIP is credited with having "led the way...in [[market segment|demographic exploitation]], [[target market|target marketing]], and saturation booking, all of which would become standard procedure for the majors in planning and releasing their mass-market 'event' films" by the late 1970s.<ref>Cook (2000), p. 324. See also p. 171.</ref> At least in terms of content, the majors were already there, putting out low-budget "[[juvenile delinquency|J.D.]]" movies such as Warner Bros.' ''Untamed Youth'' (1957), starring [[Mamie Van Doren]], and MGM's ''[[High School Confidential]]'' (1958), with [[Russ Tamblyn]]. In Bill Osgerby's description, these films "purported to preach against the 'evils' of juvenile crime, yet simultaneously provided young audiences with the vicarious thrills of delinquent rebellion," a gambit as old as [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]], if not the Hollywood hills themselves.<ref>Osgerby (2003).</ref>

In 1954, a young filmmaker named [[Roger Corman]] received his first screen credits as writer and associate producer of Allied Artists' ''Highway Dragnet''. Later that year, he independently produced his first movie, ''The Monster from the Ocean Floor'', on a $12,000 budget and a six-day shooting schedule.<ref>Di Franco (1979), p. 3.</ref> In 1955, Corman produced and directed the first official ARC release, ''Apache Woman'', one of five movies he had a hand in directing that year. Within a few months he would direct ''Day the World Ended'', half of Arkoff and Nicholson's first twin-bill package, and one of the first AIP films, ''It Conquered the World''. Corman would go on to direct over fifty feature films through 1990. As of 2007, he remained active as a producer, with more than 350 movies to his credit. Often referred to as the "King of the B's," the historically sensitive Corman has said that "to my way of thinking, I never made a 'B' movie in my life," as B movies, in the classic Hollywood sense of the term, were dying out by the time he began making pictures. He prefers to describe his metier as "low-budget exploitation films."<ref>Corman (1998), p. 36. In fact, it appears that Corman made at least one true B picture—according to Arkoff, ''Apache Woman'', to his displeasure, was handled as a second feature (Strawn [1974], p. 258).</ref> In later years Corman, both with AIP and as head of his own companies, would help launch the careers of [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[Martin Scorsese]], [[Robert Towne]], and [[Robert De Niro]], among many others. 
[[Image:Emergo.jpg|thumb|left|250px|For Allied's ''[[House on Haunted Hill]]'' (1958), producer-director [[William Castle]] arranged for theaters to send a plastic skeleton flying over the heads of the audience at a crucial moment. The gimmick was called Emergo.]]
In the late 1950s, [[William Castle]] was even better known as a B filmmaker than Corman. A long-time director and producer of mostly low-end movies for Columbia, including several entries in the studio's Whistler detective series, he left in 1957 to establish the independent Susina Productions with writer Robb White. Castle was the great innovator of the B-movie publicity gimmick. Audiences of ''Macabre'' (1958), an $86,000 production distributed by Allied Artists, were invited to take out insurance policies to cover potential death from fright. With this film and his next collaboration with White, ''[[House on Haunted Hill]]'' (1958), another Allied release, Castle "combine[d] the saturation advertising campaign perfected by Columbia and Universal in their Sam Katzman and William Alland packages with centralized and standardized publicity stunts and gimmicks that had previously been the purview of the local exhibitor."<ref>Heffernan (2004), pp. 95–98.</ref> Castle and White's 1959 creature feature ''[[The Tingler]]'', distributed by Columbia, featured his most famous gimmick, Percepto: at the film's climax, buzzers attached to select theater seats would unexpectedly rattle a few audience members, prompting either appropriate screams or even more appropriate laughter.<ref>Heffernan (2004), pp. 102–104.</ref>

The growth of the [[drive-in theater]] market was one of the major spurs to the expansion of the independent low-budget film industry. In 1946, there were approximately 300 drive-ins in the United States; a decade later, the number had reached 4,500, one-quarter of all American cinemas.<ref>Finler (1988), p. 15.</ref> Unpretentious pictures with simple, familiar plots and reliable shock effects—that is, B pictures in both production values and aesthetic spirit if not by the older, more precise industrial definition—were ideally suited for auto-based film viewing, with all its attendant distractions. The phenomenon of the '''drive-in movie''' became one of the defining symbols of American popular culture in the 1950s. Over the course of the decade, many local television stations began showing B genre films in late-night slots, popularizing the notion of the '''[[midnight movie]]'''. In the spring of 1954, Los Angeles TV station [[KABC-TV|KABC]] expanded on the concept by having an appropriately offbeat host introduce the films: on Saturday nights, ''The Vampira Show'', with [[Maila Nurmi]] as the titular MC, screened low-budget horror and suspense movies, including at least one that would become a [[cult classic]]—Edgar G. Ulmer's ''[[Detour (1945 film)|Detour]]'', produced in 1945 for $117,000. Variations on the Vampira format were soon running at stations around the country.<ref>''The Vampira Show'' is often described as having screened primarily or exclusively horror movies; as a complete listing of the films shown during its run reveals, suspense pictures often appeared: [http://www.milwaukee-horror-hosts.com/VampiraShow.html ''The Vampira Show''—KABC-TV 1954–55].

Increasingly, American-made genre films were being joined by foreign movies acquired cheaply and dubbed for the U.S. market. Promoter [[Joseph E. Levine]] was the crucial figure in this development. In 1956, he financed the shooting of new footage with American actor [[Raymond Burr]] that was edited into the Japanese sci-fi horror film ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]''. The Americanized version was distributed by Levine's [[Embassy Pictures]] as ''[[Godzilla, King of the Monsters!]]'' In 1959, Embassy acquired the worldwide rights to a cheaply made movie starring an American-born bodybuilder as one of the original superheroes. [[Steve Reeves]] had appeared in all of two films previously; his debut was in the independent production ''Jail Bait'' (1954), directed by [[Ed Wood, Jr.|Ed Wood]]. On top of a $125,000 purchase price for his import, Levine then spent $1.5 million on advertising and publicity, a virtually unprecedented amount.<ref>Cook (2000), p. 324.</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' was nonplussed: "''[[Hercules (1958 film)|Hercules]]'', an Italianmade spectacle film dubbed in English, is the kind of picture that normally would draw little more than yawns in the film market. It would have, that is, had it not been that promoter Joseph E. Levine has launched the movie throughout the country with a deafening barrage of publicity. The exploitation film, which has been taken over by Warner Brothers for distribution, opened yesterday at 135 theatres in the New York area alone."<ref>Nason (1959).</ref> Levine counted on opening-weekend box office for his profits, booking the film "into as many cinemas as he could for a week's run, then withdrawing it before poor word-of-mouth withdrew it for him."<ref>Hirschhorn (1979), p. 343.</ref> The strategy was a smashing success: the film earned $4.7 million in domestic rentals alone. Just as valuable to the bottom line, it was even more successful overseas.<ref>Cook (2000), p. 324.</ref> Within a few decades, Hollywood would be dominated by both movies and an exploitation philosophy very like Levine's.

===The golden age of exploitation (1): 1960s===
Despite all the transformations in the industry, the average production cost of an American feature film was effectively stable over the course of the 1950s. In 1961, the figure reached $2 million—after adjusting for inflation, less than 10 percent more than it had been in 1950.<ref>Finler (1988), p. 36.</ref> The traditional twin bill of B film preceding and balancing a subsequent-run A film had largely disappeared from American theaters. The AIP-style dual genre package was the new face of the double feature. In July 1960, the latest Joseph E. Levine [[Sword and sandal|sword-and-sandals]] import, ''[[Hercules and the Queen of Lydia|Hercules Unchained]]'', opened at neighborhood theaters in New York. An 82-minute-long suspense film, ''Terror Is a Man'', produced by a Manila-based, American-Philippine company, ran as a "co-feature." It had a now familiar sort of exploitation gimmick: "The dénouement helpfully includes a 'warning bell' so the sensitive can 'close their eyes.'"<ref>Thompson (1960).</ref> That year, Roger Corman took American International down a new road: "When they asked me to make two ten-day black-and-white horror films to play as a double feature, I convinced them instead to finance one horror film in color."<ref>Quoted in Di Franco (1979), p. 97.</ref> ''[[House of Usher (film)|House of Usher]]'' was a success, launching a series of Poe-based movies Corman would direct for AIP; it also typifies the continuing ambiguities of B-picture classification. ''House of Usher'' was clearly an A film by the standards of both director and studio, with the longest shooting schedule and biggest budget Corman had ever enjoyed. But from a latter-day perspective, it is regarded as a B movie—that schedule was a mere fifteen days, the budget just $200,000, one-tenth the industry average.<ref>Per Corman, quoted in Di Franco (1979), p. 97.</ref> Low-budget-movie aficionado John Reid reports once asking a neighborhood theater manager to define "B picture." The response: "Any movie that runs less than 80 minutes."<ref>Quoted in Reid (2005a), p. 5.</ref> ''House of Usher'''s running time is close, 85 minutes. And despite its high status in studio terms, it was not sent out into the world on its own, but screened in tandem with a crime melodrama asking the eternal question ''Why Must I Die?''<ref>Archer (1960).</ref>
[[Image:MotorpsychoPoster.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[Motorpsycho (film)|Motorpsycho]]'' (1965) had it all: Director [[Russ Meyer]]'s unsurpassed eye for the finer points of female anatomy. The biker theme ("MURDERcycles") that would prove its popularity in historic fashion just a few years down the road. And that money-in-the-bank word in the title: ''psycho''.]]
With the loosening of industry [[Production Code|censorship constraints]], the 1960s and 1970s saw a major expansion in the production and commercial viability of a variety of B-movie subgenres that have come to be known collectively as ''exploitation films''. The term gained broader application as well: Exploitation-style promotional practices had become standard practice at the lower-budget end of the industry; with the majors have exited traditional B production, ''exploitation'' became a way to refer to the entire field of low-budget genre films. The combination of intensive and gimmick-laden publicity with movies featuring vulgar subject matter (as judged by mainstream standards) along with often outrageous imagery dated back decades—before ''Hercules'', before ''Girls in Chains'', before even ''The Terror of Tiny Town''. ''Exploitation'' had originally defined truly fringe productions with a dose of shocking content, made at the lowest depths of Poverty Row or entirely outside the Hollywood system. Many graphically depicted the wages of sin in the context of promoting prudent lifestyle choices, particularly "[[Exploitation film#Classic exploitation|sexual hygiene]]." Audiences might see explicit footage of anything from a live birth to a ritual circumcision in such films.<ref>Schaefer (1999), pp. 187, 376.</ref> They were not generally booked as part of movie theaters' regular schedules but rather presented as special events by traveling roadshow promoters (they might also appear as fodder for "grind houses," which typically had no regular schedule at all). The most famous of those promoters, [[Kroger Babb]], was in the vanguard of marketing low-budget, sensationalistic films with a "100% saturation campaign," inundating the target audience with ads in almost any imaginable medium.<ref>Schaefer (1999), p. 118.</ref> In the era of the traditional double feature, no one would have characterized these exploitation films as "B movies." As production and exhibition practices changed, so did the terms of definition. 

In the early 1960s, exploitation movies in the original sense continued to appear: 1961's ''Damaged Goods'', a [[cautionary tale]] about a young lady whose boyfriend’s promiscuity leads to [[venereal disease]], comes complete with enormous, grotesque closeups of VD's physical manifestations.<ref>[http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/roadshow.php ''Something Weird Traveling Roadshow Films''] review of DVD release with historical analysis by Bill Gibron, July 24, 2003; part of the ''DVD Verdict'' website. Retrieved 11/17/06.</ref> At the same time, the concept of fringe exploitation was merging with a closely related and similarly venerable tradition: “[[Nudity in film|nudie]]" films featuring nudist-camp footage or striptease artists like [[Bettie Page]] had simply been the [[softcore]] pornography of previous decades. As far back as 1933, ''This Nude World'', which promised an "Authentic Trip Through an American Nudist Colony!", was "Guaranteed the Most Educational Film Ever Produced!"<ref>Halperin (2006), p. 201.</ref> In the late 1950s, as more of the old grind house theaters specifically devoted themselves to "adult" product, a few filmmakers began making nudies with some greater semblance of plots. Best known was [[Russ Meyer]], who released his first successful narrative nudie, ''[[The Immoral Mr. Teas]]'', in 1959. Five years later, on a sub-$100,000 budget, Meyer came out with ''[[Lorna (film)|Lorna]]'', "a harder-edged film that combined sex with gritty realism and violence."<ref>Halperin (2006), p. 201.</ref> A talented director, Meyer would gain renown for what became known as [[sexploitation]] pictures such as ''[[Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!]]'' (1965) and ''[[Vixen!]]'' (1968). These films were largely relegated to the fringe circuit of "adult" theaters, while AIP teen movies with wink-wink titles like ''[[Beach Blanket Bingo]]'' (1965) and ''[[How to Stuff a Wild Bikini]]'' (1966), starring [[Annette Funicello]] and [[Frankie Avalon]], played drive-ins and other reputable venues. Roger Corman's ''[[The Trip]]'' (1967) for American International, written by veteran AIP/Corman actor [[Jack Nicholson]], never shows a fully bared, unpainted breast, but flirts with nudity throughout. The Meyer and Corman lines were drawing closer.

One of the most influential films of the era, on both B's and beyond, was Paramount's ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. Its $8.5 million in earnings against a production cost of $800,000 made it the most profitable movie of 1960.<ref>Cook (2000), p. 222.</ref> Its mainstream distribution without the [[Production Code]] seal of approval helped weaken U.S. film censorship. And, as William Paul notes, this move into the horror genre by respected director [[Alfred Hitchcock]] was made, "significantly, with the lowest-budgeted film of his American career and the least glamorous stars. [Its] greatest initial impact...was on schlock horror movies (notably those from second-tier director William Castle), each of which tried to bill itself as scarier than ''Psycho''."<ref>Paul (1994), p. 33.</ref> Castle's first film in the ''Psycho'' vein was ''[[Homicidal]]'' (1961), an early step in the development of the [[slasher film|slasher]] subgenre that would flourish in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It seemed the less money available for a horror film, the better the chances of being grossed out by it: ''[[Blood Feast]]'' (1963), a movie about human dismemberment and culinary preparation made for approximately $24,000 by experienced nudie-maker [[Herschell Gordon Lewis]], established a new, more immediately successful subgenre, the gore or [[splatter film]]. Lewis's business partner [[David F. Friedman]] drummed up publicity by distributing vomit bags to theatergoers ("You May Need This When You See ''Blood Feast''")—the sort of gimmick Castle had mastered—and arranging for an injunction against the film in Sarasota, Florida—the sort of problem exploitation films had long run up against, except Friedman had planned it.<ref>Rockoff (2002), pp. 32–33.</ref> Lewis and Friedman's efforts typify the emerging sense of "exploitation"—the progressive adoption of traditional exploitation and nudie elements into horror, into other classic B genres, and into the low-budget film industry as a whole.
[[Image:YoungEvilSavagePoster.jpg|thumb|left|250px|In 1968, [[American International Pictures|AIP]] packaged ''The Conqueror Worm'', a screamer starring Vincent Price, with an Italian import: ''The Young, The Evil, and the Savage'' (originally ''Nude... si muore'') is representative of the [[giallo]] subgenre, often highly stylized films mixing sexploitation and ultraviolence. [[Mario Bava]], giallo's seminal figure, contributed to the story. Foreign genre films would appear frequently in the U.S. exploitation market during the coming decade.]]
The Production Code was officially scrapped in 1968, to be replaced by the first version of the present-day [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|rating system]]. That year, two horror films came out that heralded directions American filmmaking would take in the next decade, with major long-range consequences for the B film. One was a high-budget Paramount production, directed by the celebrated [[Roman Polanski]] and based on a bestselling novel by [[Ira Levin]]. Produced by B-horror veteran William Castle, ''[[Rosemary's Baby]]'' "took the genre up-market for the first time since the 1930s."<ref>Cook (2000), pp. 222–223.</ref> It was a critical success and the seventh-biggest box office hit of the year. The other was [[George Romero]]'s now classic ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'', produced on weekends in and around Pittsburgh for $114,000. Essentially a war movie pitting a small group of humans against a [[zombie]] [[corps]], it built on the achievement of B-genre predecessors like ''Invasion of the Body Snatchers'' in its subtextual exploration of social and political issues. The movie doubled as both a highly effective thriller and an incisive allegory for America's treatment of the descendants of its former slaves at home and its conduct of a distant [[Vietnam War|war against Vietnamese nationalists]]. Its greatest influence, though, derived not from its ideological implications but rather its clever subversion of genre clichés and the connection made between its exploitation-style imagery, low-cost, truly independent means of production, and high rate of return: $3 million in earnings in 1968, with much more to come as it was revived in various fashions.<ref>Cook (2000), p. 223.</ref> With the Production Code gone and the [[X-rated|X rating]] established, major studio A films like ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'' could now show "adult" imagery, while the market for increasingly [[hardcore pornography]] exploded. In this transformed commercial context, work like Russ Meyer's gained a new legitimacy. In 1969, for the first time a Meyer film, ''[[Finders Keepers, Lovers Weepers!]]'', was reviewed in the ''New York Times''.<ref>Canby (1969).</ref> Soon, Corman would be putting out nudity-filled sexploitation pictures such as ''Private Duty Nurses'' (1971) and ''[[Women in Cages]]'' (1971).

In May 1969, the most important of all exploitation movies premiered at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]. Much of its significance owes to the fact that it was produced for a respectable, if still modest, budget and released by a major studio. The project was first taken by one of its cocreators, [[Peter Fonda]], to American International. Fonda had become AIP's top star in the Corman–directed ''[[The Wild Angels]]'' (1966), a biker movie, and ''The Trip'', as in [[LSD]]. The idea Fonda pitched would combine those two proven themes. AIP was intrigued but balked at giving his collaborator, [[Dennis Hopper]]—who had appeared in ''The Trip'' and several other AIP opuses—free directorial rein. The duo then took their concept, for which they had projected a $60,000 budget, to producer [[Bert Schneider]]. Suggesting that they would have an easier time raising $600,000, Schneider helped arrange a financing and distribution deal with Columbia, where his brother was president. Two more graduates of the Corman/AIP exploitation mill joined the project: Jack Nicholson and cinematographer [[Laszlo Kovacs]]. The film (which managed to incorporate another favorite exploitation theme, the [[redneck]] menace, as well as a fair amount of nudity) was brought in at a cost of $501,000. ''[[Easy Rider]]'' would earn $19.1 million in rentals, becoming, as one history puts it, "the seminal film that provided the bridge between all the repressed tendencies represented by schlock/kitsch/hack since the dawn of Hollywood and the mainstream cinema of the seventies."<ref>Quote: Cagin and Dray (1984), p. 53.

===The golden age of exploitation (2): 1970s===
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, a new generation of low-budget film companies emerged that drew from all the different lines of exploitation as well as the sci-fi and teen themes that had been a mainstay since the 1950s. Operations such as Roger Corman's [[New World Pictures]], [[Cannon Films]], [[New Line Cinema]], [[Film Ventures International]], Fanfare Films, and Independent-International Pictures brought exploitation films to mainstream theaters around the country. The major studios' top product was continuing to inflate in running time—in 1970, the ten biggest earners averaged 140.1 minutes.<ref>See Finler (1988), p. 277, for top films. Finler lists ''[[Hello, Dolly! (film)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' as 1970, when it made most of its money, but it premiered in December 1969. ''[[The Owl and the Pussycat]]'', 51 minutes shorter, replaces it in this analysis.</ref> The B's were keeping pace: In 1955, Corman had a producorial hand in five movies averaging 74.8 minutes, with a range between 69 and 79. He played a similar part in five films originally released in 1970, two for AIP and three for his own New World, including an Italian horror film that he purchased for around $25,000: the average length was 89.8 minutes, with a range between 86 and 94.<ref>From 1955: ''Apache Woman'', ''The Beast with a Million Eyes'', ''Day the World Ended'', ''[[The Fast and the Furious (1954 film)|The Fast and the Furious]]'', and ''Five Guns West''. From 1970: ''Angels Die Hard'', ''Bloody Mama'', ''[[The Dunwich Horror#Adaptations|The Dunwich Horror]]'', ''Ivanna'' (aka ''Scream of the Demon Lover''; U.S. premiere: 1971), and ''The Student Nurses''. For purchase of ''Ivanna'': Di Franco (1979), p. 164.</ref> These films could turn a tidy profit. The first New World release, the biker movie ''Angels Die Hard'', cost $117,000 to produce. It was no ''Easy Rider'', but its box-office take of $2 million–plus meant a 46 percent return for New World's investors.<ref>Di Franco (1979), p. 160</ref> 

In addition to the startups, the growth of exploitation in the 1970s also involved the leading studio in the low-budget field. In 1973, American International gave a shot to director [[Brian De Palma]], whose previous movie, a Warner Bros. comedy, had flopped badly. Reviewing ''[[Sisters (film)|Sisters]]'', De Palma's first horror film, ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' critic [[Pauline Kael]] observed that its "limp technique doesn't seem to matter to the people who want their gratuitous gore. The movie supplies it, but why is there so much gratuitous dumbness to?... [H]e can't get two people talking in order to make a simple expository point without its sounding like the drabbest Republic picture of 1938."<ref>Kael (1976), p. 269.</ref> Many examples of the so-called [[blaxploitation]] genre of the early and middle part of the decade, featuring stereotype-filled stories revolving around drugs, violent crime, and prostitution, were the product of AIP. One of blaxploitation's biggest stars was [[Pam Grier]], who began her film career with a bit part in Russ Meyer's ''[[Beyond the Valley of the Dolls]]'' (1970) and who had appeared in several New World pictures, including ''The Big Doll House'' (1971) and ''The Big Bird Cage'' (1972), both directed by [[Jack Hill]]. Hill also directed her best-known performances, in two AIP blaxploitation films: ''[[Coffy]]'' (1973) and ''[[Foxy Brown]]'' (1974). Grier has the distinction of starring in the first widely distributed movie to climax with a castration scene. 
[[Image:PiranhaPosterA.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[Piranha (film)|Piranha]]'' (1978), directed by [[Joe Dante]] and written by [[John Sayles]] for Corman's [[New World Pictures]], is a triple threat: a thrilling [[horror film|creature feature]]; an outrageous parody of ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]''; and an environmentalist [[cautionary tale]].]]
Blaxploitation was the first exploitation genre to picked up by the major studios in a substantial way. Indeed, the United Artists release ''Cotton Comes to Harlem'' (1970), directed by [[Ossie Davis]], is seen as the first significant film of the type. Crossing over before the genre had even gotten established, Laurence Merrick's micro-budget independent ''The Black Angels'' (aka ''Black Bikers from Hell''; 1970) followed by a few months.<ref>Puchalski (2002), pp. 33–34.</ref> But the movie regarded as truly igniting the blaxploitation phenomenon, again completely independent, came the following year: ''[[Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song]]'' is also perhaps the most outrageous example of the form—wildly experimental in style, borderline pornographic ("Rated X by an All White Jury," declared the ads), and essentially a manifesto for a black American revolution. [[Melvin Van Peebles]] wrote, co-produced, directed, starred in, edited, and composed the music for the film, which was completed with the last-minute help of a $50,000 loan from [[Bill Cosby]].<ref>Van Peebles (2003).</ref> It premiered in April 1971, distributed by [[Cinemation Industries]], a small company then best known for releasing dubbed versions of the Italian ''[[Mondo Cane]]'' "shockumentaries" and the Swedish skin flick ''[[Fanny Hill#Film adaptations|Fanny Hill]]'', as well as for its one in-house production, ''The Man from O.R.G.Y.'' (1970). These were the sort of films that played in the "grind houses" of the day—many of them not outright porno theaters, but rather specializing in all manner of exploitation cinema. The days of six quickies for a nickel were gone, but a continuity of spirit was evident.

In 1970, a low-budget crime drama shot in [[16 mm film|16 mm]] by a first-time American director won the [[FIPRESCI|international critics' prize]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]]. ''[[Wanda (film)|Wanda]]'', written and directed by [[Barbara Loden]], is both a seminal event in the independent film movement and a classic B picture. The plot—involving a disaffected divorcée who drifts away from her coal-town life and aimlessly falls in with a small-time, would-be [[hardboiled]] crook—and the often seedy settings would have been suitable to a straightforward exploitation film or (with a little shifting of sex roles) an old-school B noir. Loden, who spent six years raising money for the sub-$200,000 production, created a film that [[Vincent Canby]] of the ''[[New York Times]]'' praised for "the absolute accuracy of its effects, the decency of its point of view and the kind of purity of technique that can only be the result of conscious discipline."<ref>Quoted in Reynaud (2006). See Reynaud also for Loden's fundraising efforts. For production cost: Schickel (2005), p. 432.

Retrieved 12/29/06.</ref> Like Romero and Van Peebles, other filmmakers of the era made pictures that combined the gut-level entertainment of exploitation with biting social commentary. The first three features directed by [[Larry Cohen]], ''Bone'' (aka ''Beverly Hills Nightmare''; 1972), ''[[Black Caesar (film)|Black Caesar]]'' (1973), and ''[[Hell Up in Harlem]]'' (1973), were all nominally blaxploitation movies, but Cohen—also the screenwriter on each film—used them as vehicles for a satirical examination of race relations and the wages of dog-eat-dog capitalism. Cohen's ''The Private Files of J. Edgar Hoover'' (1977), for AIP, might have "the look of tabloid sleaze," but one leading critic found it "perhaps the most intelligent film about American politics ever to come out of Hollywood."<ref>Taylor (1999), p. 835; Robin Wood, quoted in Cook (2000), p. 232.</ref> The gory horror film ''Deathdream'' (aka ''Dead of Night''; 1974), directed by [[Bob Clark]] and written by Alan Orsmby, is also an agonized protest of the war in Vietnam. Canadian filmmaker [[David Cronenberg]] made serious-minded low-budget horror films whose implications are not so much ideological as psychological and existential: ''[[Shivers (film)|Shivers]]'' (1975), ''[[Rabid]]'' (1977), and ''[[The Brood]]'' (1979) all involve a degree of [[self-reference|self-reflexiveness]] that, as William Paul points out, "makes Cronenberg's status as a genre director somewhat odd.... His works foreground their meaningfulness in a way that is unusual for the horror film."<ref>Paul (1994), pp. 368–369.</ref> An ''Easy Rider'' with conceptual rigor, the movie that most clearly presaged the way in which exploitation content and artistic treatment would be combined in modestly budgeted films of later years was the biker-themed ''[[Electra Glide in Blue]]'' (1973), a United Artists release directed by [[James William Guercio]].<ref>See, e.g., Tom Milne, "''Electra Glide in Blue''," in ''Time Out Film Guide'', 8th ed., ed. John Pym (London et al.: Penguin, 1999), p. 303.</ref> Critical admiration was hardly universal at the time: Roger Greenspun of the ''New York Times'' wrote, "Under different intentions, it might have made a decent grade-C Roger Corman bike movie—though Corman has generally used more interesting directors than Guercio."<ref>Greenspun (1973).</ref>

In the early 1970s, the growing practice of screening nonmainstream motion pictures as late shows, with the goal of building a [[cult film]] audience, brought the midnight movie concept home to the cinema, now with transgressive connotations. Socializing in a [[counterculture|countercultural]]  milieu was part of the original attraction of the midnight filmgoing experience, something like a drive-in movie for the [[hip (slang)|hip]].<ref>See, e.g., Jack Stevenson, ''Land of a Thousand Balconies: Discoveries and Confessions of a B-Movie Archaeologist'' (Manchester: Headpress/Critical Vision, 2003), pp. 49–50; Joanne Hollows, "The Masculinity of Cult," in ''Defining Cult Movies: The Cultural Politics of Oppositional Taste'', ed. Mark Jancovich (Manchester and New York: Manchester University Press, 2003), pp. 35–53; Janet Staiger, ''Blockbuster TV: Must-see Sitcoms in the Network Era'' (New York and London: New York University Press, 2000), p. 112.</ref> One of the first films adopted by the new midnight movie circuit in 1971 was the three-year-old ''Night of the Living Dead''. The midnight movie success of low-budget pictures made entirely outside of the studio system, like [[John Waters]]'s ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'' (1972), with its campy spin on exploitation, spurred the development of the independent film movement. ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' (1975), an inexpensive film from 20th Century-Fox that spoofed all manner of classic B-picture clichés, became an unparalleled hit when it was relaunched as a late show feature the year after its initial, unprofitable release. Even as ''Rocky Horror'' generated its own [[subculture|subcultural]] phenomenon, it contributed to the mainstreaming of the theatrical midnight movie.

On television, the parallels between the weekly series that became the mainstay of [[prime-time]] programming and the Hollywood series films of an earlier day had long been clear. In the 1970s, original feature-length programming increasingly began to echo the B movie as well. While there had been dramatic feature presentations made especially for TV since the beginning of the medium's mass commercialization in the late 1940s, they had by and large not crossed over with the realm of the B movie. In the 1950s, the live television drama—a unique amalgam of cinematic and theatrical elements exemplified by ''[[Playhouse 90]]'' (1956–1961)—had predominated. Over the course of the 1960s, there was a transition to prerecorded features; most of those produced by the major networks either aspired to the prestige of major motion pictures (e.g., CBS's 1965 ''[[Cinderella (TV)|Cinderella]]'') or were intended as pilots for projected series. During this period, AIP produced a number of low-grade genre pictures such as ''Zontar, The Thing from Venus'' (1966) intended for the first-run [[television syndication|TV syndication]] market. 
[[Image:CaliforniaKidPoster.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''The California Kid'' (1974), starring [[Martin Sheen]], is one of the more notorious original films made for the ''[[ABC Movie of the Week]]''. A wicked sheriff ([[Vic Morrow]]) takes sadistic delight in running speeders off and over the cliffside roads leading into his town. Can the Kid save the day?]]
As production of [[TV movies]] expanded with the introduction of the ''[[ABC Movie of the Week]]'' in 1969, soon followed by the dedication of other network slots to original feature presentations, time and financial factors shifted the medium progressively into B-picture territory. While many TV films of the 1970s were action-oriented genre pictures of a type familiar from contemporary cinematic B production, the small screen also saw a revival of the B melodrama. Television films inspired by recent scandals—such as ABC's ''The Ordeal of [[Patty Hearst]]'', which premiered a month after her release from prison in 1979—harkened all the way back to the 1920s and such movies as ''Human Wreckage'' and ''When Love Grows Cold'', FBO pictures made swiftly in the wake of celebrity misfortunes. Some TV movies, such as ''Nightmare in Badham County'' (ABC; 1976), headed straight into the realm of road-tripping-girls-in-redneck-bondage exploitation.

The reverberations of ''Easy Rider'' could be felt in ''Nightmare in Badham County'', as well as in a host of big-screen exploitation films of the era. But perhaps its greatest influence on the fate of the B movie was less direct. By 1973, the major studios were clearly catching on to the commercial potential of genres that had been largely consigned to the bargain basement. ''Rosemary's Baby'' had shown that a well-packaged horror "special" could be a box-office hit, but it had little in common with the exploitation style. Warner Bros.' ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', directed by [[William Friedkin]], was a different story. It showed that a heavily promoted and distributed film in the genre could be an absolute blockbuster. And more: In William Paul's description, "it is the film that really established gross-out as a mode of expression for mainstream cinema.... [P]ast exploitation films managed to exploit their cruelties by virtue of their marginality. ''The Exorcist'' made cruelty respectable. By the end of the decade, the exploitation booking strategy of opening films simultaneously in hundreds to thousands of theaters became standard industry practice."<ref>Paul (1994), pp. 288, 291.</ref> It was the biggest movie of the year and by far the highest-earning horror movie yet made. On behalf of its genre, Universal's ''[[American Graffiti]]'' did something similar. Released when writer-director [[George Lucas]] was twenty-nine years old, it is described by Paul as "essentially an American-International teenybopper pic with a lot more spit and polish"—a combination that made it the third biggest movie of 1973 and, likewise, by far the highest-earning teen-themed movie yet made.<ref>Paul (1994), p. 92.</ref> A-grade B movies of even greater historical import would follow in their wake.

In various ways, the B movies of the era have inspired later filmmakers blessed with much better financial backing. Almost all the work of present-director [[Quentin Tarantino]]—in particular, ''[[Jackie Brown]]'' (1997) and the ''[[Kill Bill]]'' movies (2003–4)—pays explicit tribute to classic exploitation cinema. Blaxploitation is directly homaged by the former, while the latter references a wide variety of Asian [[martial arts films]], which appeared as imports in U.S. theaters regularly during the 1970s. These "[[kung fu]]" films as they were often called, whatever specific martial art was featured, were popularized in the United States by the Hong Kong–produced movies of [[Bruce Lee]]. His films and later ones with such stars as Hong Kong's [[Jackie Chan]] and Japan's [[Sonny Chiba]] were marketed to the same genre/exploitation audience targeted by AIP and New World. The horror field continued to attract young, independent American directors whose work would prove especially influential. As critic [[Roger Ebert]] explained in one 1974 movie review, "Horror and exploitation films almost always turn a profit if they're brought in at the right price. So they provide a good starting place for ambitious would-be filmmakers who can't get more conventional projects off the ground."<ref>Ebert (1974).</ref> The particular movie under consideration was ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]''. Written and directed by [[Tobe Hooper]] on a budget of less than $85,000, it would earn $14.2 million in domestic rentals and become one of the most influential horror films of the decade.<ref>For the film's U.S. cost and returns: [http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0072271/business Business Data for ''The Texas Chain Saw Massacre'' (1974)] part of ''IMDb.com''.

''[[Halloween (film)|Halloween]]'' (1978), produced for around $325,000, earned $18.5 million in U.S. rentals and effectively established the slasher mode as the primary expression of the horror genre for the next decade. Just as Hooper had learned from Romero's landmark ''Night of the Living Dead'', ''Halloween'', in turn, largely followed the model of ''[[Black Christmas (1974 film)|Black Christmas]]'', directed by ''Deathdream'''s Bob Clark.<ref>For cost and returns of ''Halloween'': [http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0077651/business Business Data for ''Halloween'' (1978)] part of ''IMDb.com''.

===Decline of the B: 1980s–1990s===
Most of the B-movie production houses founded during the exploitation era collapsed or were subsumed by larger companies as the field's financial situation changed in the early 1980s. Even a comparatively cheap, efficiently made genre picture intended for theatrical release began to cost millions of dollars, as the major movie studios steadily moved into the production of expensive genre movies, raising audience expectations for spectacular action sequences and realistic special effects. Intimations of the trend were evident as early as ''[[Airport (film)|Airport]]'' (1969) and especially in the mega-schlock of ''[[The Poseidon Adventure (film)|The Poseidon Adventure]]'' (1972), ''[[Earthquake (film)|Earthquake]]'' (1973), and ''[[The Towering Inferno (film)|The Towering Inferno]]'' (1974). Their disaster plots and dialogue were B-grade at best; from an industry perspective, however, these were pictures firmly rooted in the tradition of star-stuffed extravaganzas like ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1956) and ''[[Around the World in Eighty Days (1956 film)|Around the World in Eighty Days]]'' (1956). The significance of ''The Exorcist'' (and, though not effects-driven, ''American Graffiti'') has been noted. But the tidal shift in the majors' focus owed largely to the enormous success of three films: [[Steven Spielberg]]'s [[monster movie|creature feature]] ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' (1975) and George Lucas's [[space opera]] ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' (1977) had each, in turn, become the highest-grossing film in motion picture history. ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'', released in December 1978, had proved that a studio could spend $55 million on a movie about a children's comic book character and make a very handsome profit. Not an all-time record-breaker like ''Jaws'' and ''Star Wars'', it was merely the biggest box-office hit of 1979.<ref>[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=superman.htm ''Superman'' (1978)] part of ''Box Office Mojo'' website.

Despite the mounting financial pressures, distribution obstacles, and overall risk, a substantial number of genre movies from small studios and independent filmmakers were still reaching theaters. In September 1980, Corman released his most expensive movie to date: ''[[Battle Beyond the Stars]]'', with screenplay by [[John Sayles]] and art direction by [[James Cameron]], cost New World a grand total of $2 million. By comparison, the ''Star Wars'' sequel ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', which came out three-and-a-half months before the Corman epic, was originally budgeted at $18.5 million and wound up costing $33 million, triple the cost of ''Star Wars'' just three years before.<ref>Mackey-Kallis (2001), pp. 204–205.</ref> Horror was the strongest low-budget genre of the time, particularly in the "slasher" mode as with ''[[Slumber Party Massacre|The Slumber Party Massacre]]'' (1982), directed by Amy Holden-Jones and written by feminist author [[Rita Mae Brown]].

Aside from the fact that the Concorde name did not appear on the film, it received a widely reviewed theatrical release.</ref>

Larry Cohen continued to twist genre conventions in pictures such as ''[[Q (1982 film)|Q]]'' (aka ''Q: The Winged Serpent''; 1982): "the kind of movie that used to be indispensable to the market: an imaginative, popular, low-budget picture that makes the most of its limited resources, and in which people get on with the job instead of standing around talking about it."<ref>Petit (1999), p. 1172.</ref> In 1981, New Line put out ''[[Polyester (film)|Polyester]]'', a John Waters movie with an estimated $300,000 budget and an old-school exploitation gimmick: Odorama.

Comparing it to ''Night of the Living Dead'', one reviewer said "it achieves a similarly claustrophobic intensity on a microscopic budget.

One of the most successful B-movie companies of the 1980s was a survivor from the heyday of the exploitation era, [[Troma Entertainment|Troma Pictures]], founded in 1974. Troma's most characteristic productions, including ''[[Class of Nuke 'Em High]]'' (1986), ''[[Redneck Zombies]]'' (1986), and ''[[Surf Nazis Must Die]]'' (1987), take exploitation for an absurdist spin. Troma also built on another B-studio tradition: re-releasing the often embarrassing early films of actors turning into major stars. In 1986, the company acquired and distributed two unreleased films, ''Sizzle Beach U.S.A.'' (shot in 1974) and ''Shadows Run Black'' (shot in 1981), capitalizing on performances by [[Kevin Costner]], who had recently appeared in the popular ''[[Silverado]]'' (1985) and was set to headline ''[[The Untouchables (1987 film)|The Untouchables]]'' (1987).<ref>Harper (2004), pp. 156–157.</ref> Troma's best-known production is ''[[The Toxic Avenger]]'' (1985), whose hero, after plunging into a vat of [[toxic waste]] while attempting to escape a loathsome gang of tormentors, mutates into a hideous creature with enhanced physical strength and revenge on what's left of his mind. After the film's successful release, the character, affectionately known as Toxie, became the symbol of Troma and an icon of the 1980s B movie. One of the few successful B-studio startups of the decade was Rome-based [[Empire International Pictures|Empire Pictures]], whose first production, ''[[Ghoulies]]'', reached theaters in 1985. Despite other profitable ventures such as ''[[Re-Animator]]'' (1985), financial difficulties forced the company's American founder to sell it off in 1988.<ref> Morrow (1996), pp. 112–113; [http://www.cinematical.com/2005/10/03/interview-charles-band/ "Interview: Charles Band"] interview by Robert Newton, October 3, 2005; part of ''Cinematical'' website.

The growth of the [[cable television]] industry in the 1980s helped support the low-budget film market, as many B movies quickly wound up as "filler" material for 24-hour cable channels or were made expressly for that purpose. The broadcast version of the midnight movie remained popular: the nationally syndicated ''Movie Macabre'' package starring [[Elvira|Cassandra Peterson]]—aka Elvira, Mistress of the Dark—was essentially a brassier copy of ''The Vampira Show'', presenting mostly low-budget horror films interspersed with Elvira's satiric commentary and abundant display of cleavage. The video rental market was also becoming central to B-film economics: Empire's financial model, for instance, relied on seeing a profit not from theatrical rentals, but only later, at the video store.<ref>Morrow (1996), p. 112.</ref> A number of Concorde–New Horizon releases appeared only briefly in theaters, or not at all.

By 1990, the cost of the average U.S. film had passed $25 million.<ref>[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/ Movie Box Office Results by Year, 1980–Present] part of ''Box Office Mojo'' website. Retrieved 12/29/06.</ref> Of the nine films released that year to gross more than $100 million at the U.S. box office, two would have been strictly B-movie material before the late 1970s: ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (film)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' and ''[[Dick Tracy (film)|Dick Tracy]]''. Three more—the science-fiction thriller ''[[Total Recall]]'', the action-filled detective thriller ''[[Die Hard 2]]'', and the year's biggest hit, the slapstick kiddie comedy ''[[Home Alone]]''—were also far closer to the traditional arena of the B's than to classic A-list subject matter.<ref>[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1990&p=.htm 1990 Yearly Box Office Results] part of ''Box Office Mojo'' website. Retrieved 12/29/06. Dick Tracy literally had been B-movie material—the character was featured in four low-budget RKO films in the mid- to late 1940s.

Drive-in screens were rapidly disappearing from the American landscape: between 1987 and 1990, the number in operation fell from 2,507 to 910.<ref>[http://www.drive-ins.com/exbgover.htm A Brief Overview] part of the ''Drive on In'' website.

Surviving B-movie operations adapted in different ways. Releases from Troma now frequently went [[direct-to-video|straight to video]]. As if in farewell, the company brought a title to the big screen in 1991 that summed up much of the preceding three-and-a-half decades of B movies: ''[[Chopper Chicks in Zombietown]]''. Empire's founder, [[Charles Band (filmmaker)|Charles Band]], started a new production company, [[Full Moon Features|Full Moon]], specifically to address the direct-to-video market. New Line, in its first decade, had been almost exclusively a distributor of low-budget independent and foreign genre pictures. With the smash success of exploitation veteran [[Wes Craven]]'s original ''[[Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' (1984), whose nearly $2 million cost it had directly backed, the company began moving steadily into higher-budget genre productions. In 1994, New Line was sold to the [[Turner Broadcasting System]]; it was soon being run as a midsized studio with a broad range of product alongside Warner Bros. within the [[Time Warner]] conglomerate. The following year, [[Showtime]] launched ''Roger Corman Presents'', a series of thirteen straight-to-cable movies produced by Concorde–New Horizons. A ''New York Times'' reviewer found that the initial installment qualified as "vintage Corman...spiked with everything from bared female breasts to a mind-blowing quote from [[Thomas Mann]]'s ''[[Death in Venice]]''."<ref>O'Connor (1995).</ref>

At the same time as exhibition venues for B films vanished, the independent film movement was burgeoning; among the results were various crossovers between the low-budget genre movie and the "sophisticated" arthouse picture. Director [[Abel Ferrara]], who built a reputation with violent B movies such as ''[[The Driller Killer]]'' (1979) and ''[[Ms. 45]]'' (1981), made two works in the early nineties that marry exploitation-worthy depictions of sex, drugs, and general sleaze to complex examinations of honor and redemption: ''[[King of New York]]'' (1990) was backed by a group of mostly small production companies and the cost of ''[[Bad Lieutenant]]'' (1992), $1.8 million, was financed totally independently.<ref>Johnstone (1999), p. 16; [http://mondofausto.com/interview-abelferrara.htm "Abel Ferrara, Bad Lieutenant"] part of the Mondo Video website. Retrieved 1/1/07. Online claims that ''King of New York'' was budgeted at $8 million do not appear to be well founded. No reliable figure has been located to date.</ref> Ferrara followed these two movies with ''[[Body Snatchers]]'' (1993), a major-studio remake of the sci-fi classic and an acknowledgment of his debt to the B's of an earlier generation. [[Larry Fessenden]]'s micro-budget monster movies, such as ''No Telling'' (1991) and ''Habit'' (1997), reframe classic genre subjects—[[Frankenstein]] and [[vampire|vampirism]], respectively—to explore issues of contemporary relevance—animal experimentation, ecological destruction, drug addiction, and fin-de-siècle urban romance.

David Cronenberg had stepped up in financial grade with ''[[Scanners]]'' (1980), a $3.5 million production that ''[[Time]]'' critic [[Richard Corliss]] associated with his earlier, low-budget films as well as George Romero's ''[[Dawn of the Dead]]'' (1978) and John Carpenter's ''[[The Fog]]'' (1980) as "hip parables of contemporary moral malaise."<ref>Corliss (1981).</ref> Cronenberg's crowning achievement in that vein would come a decade and a half later: Like that of ''Scanners'' in 1980, the budget of ''[[Crash (1996 film)|Crash]]'', $10 million, wasn't comfortably A-grade by 1996, but it was hardly B-level either. The film's imagery was another matter: "On its scandalizing surface, David Cronenberg's ''Crash'' suggests exploitation at its most disturbingly sick," is how [[Janet Maslin]]'s ''New York Times'' review begins. The review ends with an explanation of the film's rating: "''Crash'' has the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#X is replaced by NC-17|NC-17 rating]] (No one under 17 admitted) that it fully deserves. It includes frontal nudity, many sexual encounters and coolly grotesque situations linking sex and violence in graphic, sickening ways."<ref>Maslin (1997).</ref> Financed, like ''King of New York'', by a consortium of production companies, it was ultimately picked up for U.S. distribution by [[Fine Line Features]]. In more ways than one, this result resonated perfectly with the way the film scrambled definitions: Fine Line was a subsidiary of New Line, recently merged into the Time Warner empire—specifically, it was the old exploitation distributor's arthouse division.

===Transition II/The B movie in the digital age: 2000s===
By the turn of the millennium, the average production cost of an American feature had already spent three years above the $50 million mark.<ref>[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/ Movie Box Office Results by Year, 1980–Present] part of ''Box Office Mojo'' website. Retrieved 12/29/06.</ref> In 2005, the top ten movies at the U.S. box office included three adaptations of children's fantasy novels (including one extending and another initiating a series), a child-targeted cartoon, a comic book adaptation, a sci-fi series installment, a sci-fi remake, and a ''King Kong'' remake.<ref>[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=2005&p=.htm 2005 Yearly Box Office Results] part of ''Box Office Mojo'' website. Retrieved 1/2/07.</ref> It was a slow year for Corman: he produced just one movie, which had no American theatrical release, true of most of the pictures he had been involved in recently. ''Bloodfist 2050'', directed by long-time B filmmaker and Corman collaborator [[Cirio H. Santiago]], went straight to DVD in the United States.<ref>See, e.g., [http://www.firecracker-media.com/issue17/interview1701.shtml "Made in the Philippines: Cirio H. Santiago Interviewed"] interview by Erika Franklin, ''Firecracker'' webzine, April 2006.</ref> As big-budget Hollywood movies further usurped the genre territories that were traditionally the domain of the B's, the ongoing viability of the familiar brand of B movie was in grave doubt. Critic [[A. O. Scott]] of the ''New York Times'' warned of the impending "extinction" of
[[Image:Primer.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Does it have to be a bit schlocky to be a B? Writer-director-star-producer-composer-etc. [[Shane Carruth]] made the schlock-free sci-fi ''[[Primer (film)|Primer]]'' (2004) for $7,000. It lasts just 77 minutes—the first time around...]]

the cheesy, campy, guilty pleasures that used to bubble up with some regularity out of the B-picture ooze of cut-rate genre entertainment. Those cherished bad movies—full of jerry-built effects, abominable acting, ludicrous story lines—once flickered with zesty crudity in drive-ins and grind houses across the land. B-picture genres—science fiction and comic-book fantasy in particular, but also kiddie cartoons and horror pictures—now dominate the A-list, commanding the largest budgets and the most attention from the market-research and quality-control departments of the companies that manufacture them.... [F]or the most part, the schlock of the past has evolved into star-driven, heavily publicized, expensive mediocrities....<ref>Scott (2005).</ref>
</blockquote>
On the other hand, recent industry trends suggest the reemergence of something that looks very like the traditional A-B split in major studio production, though with fewer "programmers" bridging the gap. According to a 2006 report by industry analyst Alfonso Marone, "The average budget for a Hollywood movie is currently around $60m, rising to $100m when the cost of marketing for domestic launch (USA only) is factored into the equation. However, we are now witnessing a polarisation of film budgets into two tiers: large productions ($120-150m) and niche features ($5-20m). The rationale is that the likelihood of success is maximised by coupling ultra-large budget and highly marketable features (e.g., ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]''), with multiple low-cost bets (e.g., ''[[Little Miss Sunshine]]''). Fewer $30-70m releases are expected."<ref>[http://www.spectrumstrategy.com/Pages/GB/perspectives/Spectrum-The-Hollywood-movie-business.pdf "One More Ride on the Hollywood Roller-coaster"] industry analysis by Alfonso Marone, Spectrum Strategy Consultants senior manager; part of the Spectrum Strategy website. Retrieved 12/29/06.</ref> ''Little Miss Sunshine'' was produced by [[Fox Searchlight]], the studio's pseudo-[[independent film|indie]] subsidiary, for $8 million. With its quirky, "indie"-style comedy, the film hardly meets any conventional definition of a B movie beyond its relatively small budget, but the sorts of movies embraced by the term have shifted drastically before. Classic film noir's combination of visual beauty and verbal wit, for instance, was hardly common coin in exploitation-era B filmmaking. Further expanding the field, Fox launched a new subsidiary in 2006, [[Fox Atomic]], to concentrate on teen-oriented genre films, mostly variations of horror. The genre focus is similar to that of [[Sony Pictures Entertainment|Sony]]'s [[Screen Gems]] division and the [[The Weinstein Company|Weinsteins]]' [[Dimension Films]], but the economic model is deliberately low-rent, at least by major studio standards. According to a ''[[Variety]]'' report, "Fox Atomic is staying at or below the $10 million mark for many of its movies. It's also encouraging filmmakers to shoot digitally—a cheaper process that results in a grittier, teen-friendly look. And forget about stars. Of Atomic's nine announced films, not one has a big-name."<ref>Zeitchik and Laporte (2006).</ref> In sum, this is an updated version of a Golden Age big studio B unit targeting a market very similar to the one Arkoff and Nicholson's AIP helped define in the 1950s.

In a development hinted at in this ''Variety'' piece, recent technological advances are greatly facilitating the production of truly low-budget motion pictures. Although there have always been economical means with which to shoot movies, including [[Super 8 mm film|Super 8]] and [[16 mm film]] and [[video]] cameras recording onto [[analog signal|analog]] [[videotape]], these mediums could hardly rival the image quality of [[35 mm film]]. The development and widespread usage of [[digital video|digital cameras]] and [[postproduction]] methods allow even low-budget filmmakers to produce films with excellent (and not necessarily "grittier") image quality and precise editing effects—though technical excellence is no guarantee of aesthetic value or even cinematographic competence. As Marone observes, "the equipment budget (camera, support) required for shooting digital is approximately 1/10th that for film, significantly lowering the production budget for independent features. At the same time, over the past 2-3 years, the quality of digital filmmaking has improved dramatically."<ref>[http://www.spectrumstrategy.com/Pages/GB/perspectives/Spectrum-The-Hollywood-movie-business.pdf "One More Ride on the Hollywood Roller-coaster"].</ref> Independent filmmakers, whether working in a genre or arthouse mode, continue to find it difficult to gain access to distribution channels, though so-called digital end-to-end methods of distribution offer new opportunities. In a similar way, the popularity of Internet sites such as [[YouTube]] have opened up entirely new avenues for the presentation of low-budget motion pictures, which may, like television, become largely institutionalized as a parallel production and exhibition model with the cinema, or may lead to a redefinition of the concept of cinema itself.

===C movie===
The '''C movie''' is the grade of motion picture at the low end of the B movie, or—in some taxonomies—simply below it.<ref>See, e.g., Megumi Komiya and Barry Litman, "The Economics of the Prerecorded Videocassette Industry," in ''Social and Cultural Aspects of VCR Use'', ed. Julia R. Dobrow (Hillsdale, N.J.: Lawrence Erlbaum, 1990), pp. 25–44.</ref>  In the 1980s, with the growth of [[cable television]], the C grade began to be applied with increasing frequency to low-quality genre films used as filler programming for that market. The "C" in the term then does double duty, referring not only to quality that is lower than "B" but also to the initial ''c'' of ''cable.'' Helping to popularize the notion of the C movie was the successful TV series ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' (1988–99), which ran on national cable channels (first [[Comedy Central]], then the [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]]) after its first year; updating the concept introduced by [[Maila Nurmi|Vampira]] over three decades before, ''MST3K'' presented cheap, low-grade movies, primarily science fiction of the 1950s and 1960s, along with running voiceover commentary highlighting the films' shortcomings in script and production. Director [[Ed Wood, Jr.|Ed Wood]] has been called "the master of the 'C-movie,'" in this sense, although the term ''Z movie'' (see below) is perhaps even more applicable to his work.<ref>Oppermann (1996).</ref> The rapid expansion of niche cable and satellite outlets such as Sci Fi (with its [[Sci Fi Pictures original films|Sci Fi Pictures]]) and [[HBO]]'s genre channels in the 1990s and 2000s has meant an ongoing market for contemporary C pictures, many of them "direct to cable" movies—modestly budgeted genre films never released in theaters.<ref>See, e.g., [http://www.filmthreat.com/index.php?section=interviews&Id=924&archive=Date&match=0&page=2 "David Payne: Do Fear the Reeker"] interview with the director by Eric Campos, December 12, 2005; part of the ''Film Threat'' website.

===Z movie===  
[[Image:Plan_9_poster.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Ed Wood]]'s ultra-low-budget ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'' (1959) has become the most famous Z movie of all time—and not for being unexpectedly good.]]
The term '''Z movie''' (or '''grade-Z movie''') arose in the mid-1960s as an informal description of certain unequivocally non-A films. It was soon adopted to characterize low-budget pictures with quality standards well below those of most B and even C movies.<ref>The earliest usage of the term (as ''grade-Z movie'', and without the full derogatory meaning now usually intended) so far located is in a contemporary newspaper review of ''[[The Tomb of Ligeia]]'' (1964), an AIP production directed by Roger Corman: Kevin Thomas, "Poe 'Tomb' Is Stylish Scare Film," ''Los Angeles Times'', January 22, 1965. See also a short story by George P. Elliott, "Into the Cone of Cold," in Elliott, ''An Hour of Last Things and Other Stories'' (New York: Harper & Row, 1968), 7–55; p. 27. The earliest clear use of ''Z movie'' so far located in its now prevalent sense is by Todd McCarthy in the introduction to McCarthy and Flynn (1975), p. xii.</ref> While B movies may have mediocre scripts and actors who are relatively unknown or past their prime, they are for the most part competently lit, shot, and edited. The economizing shortcuts of films identified as C movies tend to be evident throughout; nonetheless, C movies are the products of relatively stable entities within the commercial film industry and thus still adhere to certain production norms.

In contrast, most films referred to as Z movies are made outside of the organized studio system on very small budgets. As a result, scripts are often laughably bad, continuity errors tend to arise during shooting, and nonprofessional actors are frequently cast. Many Z movies are also poorly lit and edited. The micro-budget "quickies" of 1930s fly-by-night Poverty Row production houses may be thought of as Z movies ''avant la lettre''.<ref>See, e.g., Taves (1995), p. 323.</ref> Latter-day Z's are often characterized by violent, gory, and/or sexual content and a minimum of artistic interest, readily falling into the category of exploitation, or "grind house," films.

Two films are frequently cited as exemplifying the Z movie:

*''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'' (1959), directed by [[Ed Wood, Jr.|Ed Wood]], is often cited as the worst film ever made.  It features an incoherent plot, bizarre dialogue, inept acting, intrusive narration, the cheapest conceivable special effects, and cardboard sets that the actors occasionally bump into and knock over.  Stock footage is used throughout, whole sequences are used multiple times, [[boom operator (media)|boom mics]] are visible, and actors frequently appear to be reading from cue cards. Outdoor sequences contain parts filmed during both day and night in the same scene.  The movie stars Maila Nurmi, in her Vampira persona, and Bela Lugosi, who died before the film was made. Test footage of Lugosi shot for a different project is intercut with shots of a double with a different physique and hair color, who covers his face with a cape in every scene. The narrator refers to the film by its preproduction name, "Grave Robbers from Outer Space."

*''[[The Creeping Terror]]'' (1964), directed by Arthur J. Nelson (who also stars in the film under the pseudonym Vic Savage), uses some memorable bargain-basement effects: stock footage of a rocket launch is played in reverse to depict the landing of an alien spacecraft; what appears to be shag carpet is draped over several actors shambling about at a snail's pace, thus bringing the monstrous "creeping terror" to the screen. The movie also employs a technique that has come to be synonymous with Z-movie horror: [[voiceover]] narration that paraphrases dialogue being silently enacted onscreen.

Though ''Z movie'' is most commonly used to describe films of this order, some critics use the term more broadly to describe any low-budget movie that defies the norms of mainstream filmmaking in some significant way.<ref>See, e.g., David James (''Allegories of Cinema: American Film in the Sixties''), quoted in Kevin Heffernan, ''Ghouls, Gimmicks, and Gold: Horror Films and the American Movie Business, 1953–1968'' (Durham and London: Duke University Press, 2004), p. 224.</ref>

===Psychotronic movie===
'''Psychotronic movie''' is a term coined by film critic Michael J. Weldon—referred to by a fellow critic as "the historian of marginal movies"—to denote the sort of low-budget genre pictures that are generally disdained or ignored entirely by the critical establishment.<ref>[http://community.tvguide.com/thread.jspa?threadID=700004011 "Sad News: ''Psychotronic Video'' Magazine Gives Up the Ghost"], column by Maitland McDonagh, ''TVGuide.com'', July 17, 2006. Retrieved 12/26/06.</ref> Weldon's immediate source for the term was the Chicago cult film ''[[The Psychotronic Man]]'' (1980), whose titular character is a barber who develops the bizarre ability to kill using psychic energy.<ref>[http://www.psychotronicvideo.com/wow/vestibule.shtml The Psychotronic Vestibule] portal to Weldon's ''Psychotronic Web'' site. Retrieved 10/20/06.</ref> According to Weldon, “My original idea with that word is that it’s a two-part word. 'Psycho' stands for the horror movies, and 'tronic' stands for the science fiction movies. I very quickly expanded the meaning of the word to include any kind of exploitation or B-movie.”<ref>[http://www.uttertrash.net/michaelweldon.htm "The Psychotronic Man"] interview with Michael Weldon by Bob Ignizio, April 20, 2006; part of the ''Utter Trash'' website. Retrieved 10/20/06.</ref> The term, popularized beginning in the 1980s with publications of Weldon's such as ''The Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film'' and ''Psychotronic Video'' magazine, has subsequently been adopted by other critics and fans. Use of the term tends to emphasize a focus on and affection for those B movies that lend themselves to appreciation as [[camp (style)|camp]].<ref>See, e.g., Steven Jay Schneider and Tony Williams, "Introduction" (1–12; pp. 2, 5), and Andrew Syder and Dolores Tierney, "Importation/Mexploitation, or, How a Crime-Fighting, Vampire-Slaying Mexican Wrestler Almost Found Himself in an Italian Sword-and-Sandals Epic" (33–55; pp. 34–35, 50–53), in ''Horror International'', ed.
