'''Brian Samuel Epstein''', born in [[Liverpool]], [[England]] ([[19 September]] [[1934]] &ndash; [[27 August]] [[1967]]) was an [[England|English]] [[impresario]], who is best known as the [[music management|manager]] of [[The Beatles]]. 

Epstein took over management of The Beatles when they were just one of over 300 "beat" groups in Liverpool striving for success. Though he had no previous experience in artist management, Epstein persuaded [[George Martin]] to sign the Beatles to [[EMI]]'s small [[Parlophone]] label after the group had been rejected by every major British record company. Under Epstein's guidance and management, The Beatles went on to have massive international success.

Epstein died of an accidental drug overdose at his home in [[London]] in August [[1967]].  The importance of Epstein to the success of the Beatles is underscored by the opinions of two of its members. In 1970, John Lennon attributed the eventual dissolution of the group to Epstein's death.  "I knew that we were in trouble then..."  In 1997, [[Paul McCartney]] said of Epstein: "If anyone was the [[Fifth Beatle]], it was Brian."

==Early life==
<!-- Put references into this article from books (with page numbers)  or web pages -->
Epstein was born into a [[Jewish]] family in Liverpool, England. His grandfather (Isaac Epstein) was from Hodan, [[Lithuania]], who arrived in England with his wife Diana in the 1890s, at the age of eighteen. He founded a [[furniture]] dealership on Walton Road, Liverpool. Diana and Isaac's third son was Harry Epstein; the father of Brian Epstein.<ref name="Spitzp255"> Spitz 2005. p255</ref> After Harry and his brothers had joined the family firm, Isaac Epstein founded "I. Epstein and Sons", and expanded his furniture business by taking over an adjacent shop to sell a varied range of other goods, such as musical instruments and [[household appliances]].<ref name="Spitzp255"/> They called the new shop "NEMS" (North End Music Stores) from which Paul McCartney's father once bought a piano.<ref name="SpitzPage71"> Spitz 2005. p71</ref><ref name="MilesPage23-24"> Miles 1998. pp23-24.</ref>

Epstein's mother was formally named Malka - though always known by her family as "Queenie" ("Malka" translating as "queen" in [[Hebrew]]). She was a member of the successful Hyman furniture family. Harry and Malka also had another son, Clive. During [[WWII]], the Epsteins moved to [[Southport]] to escape [[The Blitz]]—where two schools expelled Epstein for laziness and poor performance—but returned to Liverpool in 1945.<ref name="Spitzp257"> Spitz 2005. p257</ref> After his parents had moved him from one [[boarding school]] to another, the 14-year-old Epstein spent two years at [[Wrekin College]], in [[Shropshire]]. Shortly before his sixteenth birthday in 1950, he sent a long letter to his father, explaining that he wanted to become a [[Fashion design|dress designer]]. Harry Epstein was adamantly opposed to this idea, and his son finally had to "report for duty" at the family's furniture shop.<ref name="Spitzp258-259"> Spitz 2005. pp258-259</ref> 

In December 1951, Epstein was [[Conscription|drafted]]—as a [[Data entry clerk|clerk]]—into the [[Royal Army Service Corps]], and was posted to the [[Albany Street Barracks]] near [[Regent's Park]], in [[London]].<ref name="Spitzp259"> Spitz 2005. p259</ref> He was often reprimanded for not picking up his army [[Salary|pay]], and had a tailor make an officer's uniform for him that he wore when [[Cruising for sex|cruising]] the bars of London.<ref name="MilesPage86"> Miles 1998. p86.</ref> Epstein was arrested one night (for impersonating an officer) at the Army and Navy Club on [[Piccadilly]] by the [[Military Police]], but managed to avoid a [[court martial]] by agreeing to see an army psychiatrist, who uncovered Epstein's [[homosexuality]].<ref name="MilesPage86"> Miles 1998. p86.</ref> He was discharged from the army after ten months on the medical grounds of being "emotionally and mentally unfit".<ref name="Spitzp260"> Spitz 2005. p260</ref> 

In 1955, at the age of twenty-one, Epstein was made a director of NEMS. In September of 1956, he took a trip to London to meet a friend, but after being there for only one day, he was robbed of his [[passport]], [[birth certificate]], [[cheque]]book, [[wristwatch]], and all the money he had on him. As he did not want his parents to find out, he worked as [[department store]] [[clerk]] until he had earned enough money to buy a train ticket back to Liverpool.<ref name="Spitzp261"> Spitz 2005. p261</ref> Back in Liverpool, he confessed "everything" to a psychiatrist—a friend of the Epstein family—who suggested to Harry Epstein that his son should leave Liverpool as soon as possible. During the sessions Epstein had revealed his ambition of becoming an [[actor]], so his parents allowed him go to London to study.<ref name="Spitzp261"/>      

Epstein attended the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] (RADA) in London. His RADA classmates included actors [[Susannah York]], [[Albert Finney]] and [[Peter O'Toole]], but Epstein dropped out after the third term. Back in Liverpool, Harry Epstein put his son in charge of the record department of the newly-opened NEMS music store on Great Charlotte Street.<ref name="Spitzp263"> Spitz 2005. p263</ref> Epstein worked "day and night" at the store to make it a success, and it became one of the biggest musical retail outlets in the North of England.<ref name="Spitzp264"> Spitz 2005. p264</ref>

The Epsteins opened a second store at 12-14 Whitechapel, and Epstein was put in charge of the entire operation. Epstein often walked across the road to the [[Lewis]] department store—which had a music section—where [[Peter Brown (music industry)|Peter Brown]] was employed. He watched Brown's sales technique and was impressed enough to lure Brown to work for NEMS with the offer of a higher salary and a commission on sales.<ref name="Brownp63"> Brown, Peter. 2002. p63</ref> On [[3 August]] [[1961]], Epstein started a regular music column in the ''[[Mersey Beat]]'' magazine, called, 'Record Releases, by Brian Epstein of NEMS'.<ref name="Spitzp257"> Spitz 2005. p257</ref>

[[Image:Cellarful.gif|thumb|right|200px|Cover of the 1998 US paperback reissue of Epstein's 1964 autobiography [[A Cellarful of Noise]]]]
Epstein supposedly first noticed the Beatles' name in issues of Mersey Beat, and on numerous posters around Liverpool, before asking [[Bill Harry]] who they were.<ref name="Milesp84"> Miles 1998. p84</ref><ref name="Milesp84-85"> Miles 1998. pp84-85</ref> Harry had previously convinced Epstein to sell the Mersey Beat magazine at NEMS, and The Beatles were featured on the front page of the second issue of Mersey Beat.<ref name="Spitzp264-265"> Spitz 2005. pp264-265</ref><ref name="MilesPage88"> Miles 1998. p88</ref> Epstein later asked [[Alistair Taylor]] about the '[[My Bonnie]]' [[Single (music)|single]] that the Beatles had recorded with [[Tony Sheridan]], in [[Germany]] in NEMS some months after its release.<ref name="Spitzp265"> Spitz 2005. p265</ref> Epstein's version of the story was that a customer—Raymond Jones—walked into the NEMS shop and asked Epstein for the "My Bonnie" single, which made Epstein curious about The Beatles.<ref name="BiographyofEpstein">[http://www.momentmag.com/features/aug06/2006-08_Epstein.html  momentmag.com: Biography of Epstein] Retrieved: 10 March 2007 </ref> 

On [[9 November]] [[1961]], Epstein asked Bill Harry to arrange for Epstein and Taylor to watch The Beatles perform at a lunchtime concert in the crowded [[Cavern Club]], which was not far from the NEMS store. Epstein and Taylor were allowed into the club without queuing, and a welcome was announced over the club's [[PA system|public-address system]] after The Beatles had performed by [[Bob Wooler]], who was the resident [[DJ]].<ref name="Spitzp266-268"> Spitz 2005. pp266-268</ref> Epstein later talked about the Beatles' performance: 
{{cquote | I was immediately struck by their music, their beat, and their sense of humour on stage—and, even afterwards, when I met them, I was struck again by their personal charm. And it was there that, really, it all started.<ref name="EpsteindotCom">[http://www.brianepstein.com/ brianepstein.com] Retrieved: 15 March 2007 </ref> }} 
After their performance, Epstein and Taylor went into the [[dressing room]]—which was "as big a broom cupboard"—to talk to them. The Beatles immediately recognised Epstein—as they were regular customers at NEMS—but before Epstein could congratulate them on their performance, [[George Harrison]] said, "And what brings ''Mr. Epstein'' here?"<ref name="Spitzp268"> Spitz 2005. p268</ref> Epstein went to the Cavern for the next three weeks whenever The Beatles played there, and in a meeting with the Beatles at NEMS on [[10 December]] [[1961]], he proposed the idea of managing them.<ref name="MilesPage85"> Miles 1998. p85</ref> Epstein contacted their previous booking agent, [[Allan Williams]], to confirm that Williams no longer had any ties to them, but Williams advised Epstein "not to touch them with a [[barge pole]]".<ref name="Milesp75"> Miles 1998. p75</ref> 

The four Beatles signed a five-year contract with Epstein on [[24 January]] [[1962]].<ref name="MilesPage88"> Miles 1998. p88</ref> Although Epstein had had no prior experience of artist management, he had a strong influence on the Beatles' early dress-code and attitude on stage. When Epstein discovered the band, they wore blue jeans and leather jackets, performing at rowdy [[rock 'n' roll]] shows where they would stop and start songs when they felt like it, or when an audience member requested a certain song. Epstein encouraged them to wear suits and ties, and insisted that they stop [[swearing]], smoking, drinking or eating onstage. He also suggested the famous synchronized bow at the end of their performances.<ref name="Spitzp279-280"> Spitz 2005. pp279-280</ref> McCartney was the first of the Beatles to agree with Epstein's ideas, believing it was—in part—due to Epstein's RADA training.<ref name="Milesp96"> Miles 1998. p96</ref>

Epstein made numerous trips to London from Liverpool to visit record companies, in the hope of securing a record contract for the Beatles, but was rejected by every major record label in [[Britain]], including [[Columbia Records|Columbia]], [[Pye Records|Pye]], [[Philips Records|Philips]], [[Oriole Records|Oriole]], and most famously, [[Decca]] (see [[The Decca audition]]).<ref name="Milesp89"> Miles 1998. p89</ref> The Beatles later found out that Epstein had paid Decca producer [[Tony Meehan]] (ex-drummer of the [[The Shadows|Shadows]]) to produce the studio recordings.<ref name="Milesp89"> Miles 1998. p89</ref> While Epstein was negotiating with Decca, he also approached EMI marketing executive Ron White.<ref>Coleman 1989 p88–89</ref> White later contacted EMI producers [[Norrie Paramor]], Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell, but they all declined to record The Beatles.<ref>Coleman 1989 p93</ref> White could not contact EMI's fourth staff producer (Martin) as he was on holiday.<ref>Coleman 1989 p93–94</ref>

On [[8 February]] [[1962]], Epstein visited a [[HMV]] store in [[Oxford Street]], London, to have the Decca audition tape transferred to disc. A [[HMV]] technician named Jim Foy liked the recordings, and suggested that Epstein should contact [[Parlophone]]'s George Martin.<ref name="BeatlesHistory">[http://geocities.com/dsmurashev.geo/history/1962.htm  geocities.com: Beatles’ History - 1962] Retrieved: 9 March 2007 </ref> On [[9 May]] [[1962]], Epstein was eventually able to persuade Martin to sign the Beatles to EMI's small Parlophone label, without Martin ever having seen them play live.<ref name="Milesp90"> Miles 1998. p90</ref> 

Martin scheduled an audition—at [[Abbey Road Studios]]—which they passed, but with one exception: Martin did not like drummer [[Pete Best]]'s playing.<ref name="Milesp90"> Miles 1998. p90</ref> When the news came that Martin wanted to replace Best on their recordings with a session drummer, Lennon, McCartney and Harrison asked Epstein to fire Best from the band. Epstein agonised about the decision, and asked Bob Wooler if it was a good idea, to which Wooler replied that Best was very popular with the fans and they wouldn't like it at all.<ref name="Spitzp329"> Spitz 2005. p329</ref> [[Ringo Starr]] took his place, as Starr had previously played with [[Rory Storm|Rory Storm and the Hurricanes]], and had previously stepped in to drum with the Beatles when Best was ill or unable to play.<ref name="Milesp90"> Miles 1998. p90</ref>

===After Candlestick Park===
<!-- Put references into this article from books (with page numbers)  or web pages -->
The Beatles' hectic schedule of touring, television, and film work between 1963-65 kept Epstein and the Beatles very busy. After the Beatles' last live concert at [[Candlestick Park]] in San Francisco, California on [[29 August]] [[1966]], Epstein's management duties changed to reflect the changing nature of the Beatles' career. He wanted them to continue touring, however, but the Beatles adamantly refused.<ref name="Spitzp666"> Spitz 2005. p666</ref> By 1967, the Beatles were paying less attention to Epstein's advice on many issues, such as the legally risky cover art of ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''. Epstein later brought [[Robert Stigwood]] into the NEMS organisation, and wanted to sell the control of NEMS to him, but didn't tell the Beatles about his decision.<ref name="Spitzp725-726"> Spitz 2005. p725-726</ref>

Before Epstein's death, McCartney had been taking a much more active interest in the Beatles' finances, and the group was becoming aware that some artists with more ruthless managers—such as the [[Rolling Stones]] under [[Allen Klein]]—claimed to be receiving more commercially advantageous terms. After Epstein's death, Stigwood wanted to take over the management of The Beatles—believing that he was the "natural successor"—but the Beatles vehemently opposed him, with Lennon saying, "We don't know you. Why would we do this?"<ref name="Spitzp725-726"> Spitz 2005. p725-726</ref>

===Business dealings===
<!-- Put references into this article from books (with page numbers)  or web pages -->
The vast majority of informed opinion about Brian Epstein's business dealings commend him for his integrity.  After his death a few people have insinuated that he may have taken advantage of them in some way though there is no documented evidence to substantiate these insinuations  A persepctive that arose some years after his death - as rock music became a massive industry - was that he was naive in some areas of his dealings and placed trust in advisors who gave Epstein poor counsel.  One of the Beatles' closest business advisors Denis O'Dell (a Director of Apple) discussed this revisionism about Epstein as a businessman in his 2002 book "At The Apple's Core".  " "...it's easy to be critical retrospectively about these deals and wise after the event, and much of the posthumous criticism of Brian's merchandising mistakes is pretty stupid. At the time that he and his advisors had made these deals pop merchandising was in its infancy...Nobody knew the full potential or full implications of such deals. Sailing in uncharted waters, Brian had nothing to measure his decisions against. Is it fair to criticize him in light of this? I doubt whether those who are so quick to condemn his deals would have been any wiser at the time..."  <ref name="EpsteinandBusiness">[http://www.beatlemoney.com/epsteinbusiness.htm  beatlemoney.com: Comments about Epstein and business] Retrieved: 11 March 2007 </ref> McCartney admitted that they signed all the contracts Epstein presented to them without reading them first, and when asked for a comment about The Beatles' business dealings after Epstein’s death, Lennon once said, "Well, he [Epstein] was alright. I've found out since, of course, that he wasn't quite as honest to us as he made out".<ref name="Milesp146"> Miles 1998. p146</ref><ref name="McCabeSchonfeldFortheRecord"> McCabe/Schonfeld “For The Record” 1984. p90</ref> Although, in the vast majority of Lennon's published interviews, his descriptions of Epstein were reverential, and the opinions of Martin and Taylor about Epstein agree—expressed in Ray Coleman's 1987 biography of Epstein—as they both referred to Epstein's integrity, honesty, and his devotion to the Beatle's success.

Although the Beatles signed Epstein's first management contract, Epstein did not sign it himself, thereby giving himself the option of withdrawing at any time. The contract could not have been legally binding on McCartney and Harrison in any case, as they were both still [[Minor (law)|minors]] (which at the time in England was people under the age of 21) and thus lacked the [[Legal capacity#Natural persons|legal capacity]] to sign a [[Contract|binding contract]]. The first contract stated that Epstein would receive a management commission of 25 per cent of the Beatles' [[gross income]] after a certain threshold had been reached.<ref name="MilesPage88"> Miles 1998. p88</ref><ref name="MilesPage144-145"> Miles 1998. pp144-145</ref> The Beatles argued for a smaller percentage, but Epstein pointed out that he had been paying their [[expenses]] for months, without receiving anything back.<ref name=" CynthiaJohnp103"> Cynthia Lennon – “John” 2006. p103</ref> 

Epstein once offered to pay the Beatles a fixed wage of £50-a-week for life, instead of receiving money from record sales. Harrison commented that he was earning £25 a week at the time, which was more than the £10 a week his father was earning, but the Beatles declined Epstein's offer, as they thought that they were worth much more than £50-a-week.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/955196.stm  bbc.co.uk: Epstein 'wanted Beatles fortune'] Retrieved: 9 March 2007 </ref> After the release of [[Love Me Do]] in 1962, Epstein signed a second (and legally binding) contract with the Beatles.<ref name="LewisohnChronicles"> Lewisohn “Chronicles” 2006. p61.</ref><ref name="BeatlesContracts">[http://www.beatlemoney.com/epsteinactualcontract.htm  beatlemoney.com: Epstein’s contracts] Retrieved: 11 March 2007 </ref>  

The recording contract that EMI offered Epstein for The Beatles gave them one [[penny]] for each single sold, which was split amongst the four Beatles, meaning one [[British Farthing coin|farthing]] per group member.<ref name="History62">[http://www.beatles-discography.com/index.html?http://www.beatles-discography.com/1962.html  beatles-discography.com: "Beatles History: 1962" at ''Beatles Discography''.] Retrieved: 29 January 2007 </ref> The royalty rate was further reduced for singles sold outside the UK, on which the Beatles received half of one penny (again split between the whole band) per single.<ref name="Brownp79"> Brown, Peter. 2002. p79</ref> Martin said later that EMI had "nothing to lose" by signing a contract with the Beatles.<ref name="GeorgeMartinBeatleMoney">[http://www.beatlemoney.com/martingeneral.htm  beatlemoney.com: George Martin and money] Retrieved: 11 March 2007 </ref> 

Epstein booked the Beatles' concerts himself, and also presented groups managed by NEMS as an opening act for The Beatles, thereby making money for NEMS as the [[Entrepreneur|promoter]], [[Talent agent|booking agent]], and [[Manager]] for all their concerts.<ref name="Brownp102"> Brown, Peter 2002. p102</ref> As promoters were desperate to book The Beatles, Epstein avoided paying some [[tax]] by accepting "hidden" fees on the night of a performance, which he always kept in a brown paper bag.<ref name="Brownp110"> Brown, Peter. 2002. p110</ref> In addition to managing The Beatles, Epstein also successfully managed [[Gerry & the Pacemakers]], who were the second group to sign with Epstein, and recorded for [[Columbia Records]], [[Billy J. Kramer]] and the Dakotas (who had three hits with Lennon-McCartney songs) the [[The Fourmost|Fourmost]] (their first two singles were written by Lennon) the [[The Cyrkle|Cyrkle]] (Epstein's first American group) [[Cilla Black]] (who was Epstein's only female artist) as well as other artists.

On the Beatles' first flight to America Epstein was constantly offered numerous samples of products by merchandisers—who required a licence from Epstein to sell them—including clocks, pens, plastic wigs, bracelets, and games, but Epstein and the Beatles rejected all of them. David Jacobs, the lawyer for NEMS, had already given away some exclusive merchandising rights to Nicky Byrne in [[England]], which later turned out to be a financial mistake as Epstein had asked for a percentage that was far below the norm at the time.<ref name="Spitzp465-466"> Spitz 2005. pp465-466</ref> Once the Beatles were ensconced in the Plaza hotel in [[New York]], Epstein was further besieged by calls and visits from merchandisers, promoters, television commentators, and hustlers—all demanding to talk to him.<ref name="Spitzp458-464"> Spitz 2005. pp458-464</ref> [[Capitol records]]—mindful of the number of records The Beatles were selling in America—sent a [[posh]], well-spoken [[Yorkshire]] girl, Wendy Hanson, to the Plaza hotel to act as Epstein's secretary, and to filter his calls.<ref name="Spitzp464"> Spitz 2005. p464</ref> Hanson later worked solely with Epstein in his Albemarle Street office, which was separate from the NEMS office.<ref name="Spitzp667"> Spitz 2005. p667</ref>

Epstein asked James Trevor Isherwood (a [[Chartered Accountant]]) to set up a company to collect Lennon and McCartney's [[PRS]] payments—called Lenmac—which he did on [[12 May]] [[1964]]. When he first visited Epstein's office, Isherwood was surprised to learn that Epstein took 25% of the Beatles' [[gross income]], and not what he imagined was the usual 10% that other managers received at that time.<ref name="Milesp144"> Miles 1998. p144</ref> All of Epstein's [[expenses]] were also deducted from the Beatles' income, which meant office rental, staff wages, travel, telephone costs, and entertaining expenses.<ref name="Milesp145"> Miles 1998. p145</ref> Before his death, Epstein knew that the renegotiation of his contract with the Beatles (on [[30 September]] [[1967]]) would reduce his management fee from 25 per cent to 10 per cent, as The Beatles were no longer touring.<ref name="Milesp405"> Miles 1998. p405</ref>  

Epstein arranged for the Beatles to enter into a publishing agreement with [[Dick James]] Music (DJM) and set up a company called [[Northern Songs]]. James received 25 per cent of the shares, and Charles Silver—his financial partner and [[accountant]]—also received 25 per cent. Lennon and McCartney received 20 per cent each, and Epstein held the remaining 10 per cent.<ref name="Milesp147"> Miles 1998. p147</ref> After the PRS income from The Beatles increased rapidly, Epstein asked Isherwood to work out a way of avoiding the tax that Lennon and McCartney would have to pay. Isherwood suggested a [[Initial public offering|Stock-market flotation]] for Northern Songs, and further advised Epstein that the Beatles should move to houses near his [Isherwood's] in [[Esher]] during the flotation, which Lennon, Harrison, and Starr did—with only Epstein and McCartney remaining in London.<ref name="Milesp166-167"> Miles 1998. pp166-167</ref> 

In July 1966, when the Beatles were touring the [[Philippines]], Epstein unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady, [[Imelda Marcos]].<ref name="Spitzp619"> Spitz 2005. p619</ref> When presented with an invitation to a breakfast party, Epstein politely declined on behalf of the group, as it had never been the Beatles's policy to accept such official invitations.<ref name="Spitzp620"> Spitz 2005. p620</ref> After the group boarded the plane to fly home, Epstein and [[Mal Evans]] were ordered off, with both believing they would not be allowed back on the plane.<ref name="Spitzp624"> Spitz 2005. p624</ref> Epstein was forced to give back most of the money that The Beatles had earned in the Philippines before being allowed back on the plane.<ref name="Spitzp625"> Spitz 2005. p625</ref>  

After moving to London Epstein rented an office in Monmouth Street—close to [[Seven Dials]]—in 1965, and later leased the [[Saville Theatre]] on [[Shaftesbury Avenue]]. He promoted new works by writers such as [[Arnold Wesker]] in productions that occasionally fell afoul of the [[Lord Chamberlain]] by including "obscene" content or nudity. Epstein changed the programme to that of a music venue in 1966, presenting various U.S. acts.<ref name="Spitzp648-649"> Spitz 2005. pp648-649</ref>

Throughout Epstein's life he was known to be kind and caring to his family, friends of his family, business colleagues, and the Beatles. When Lennon married [[Cynthia Lennon|Cynthia Powell]], on [[23 August]] [[1962]], at the Mount Pleasant [[Register office]] in Liverpool, he attended the wedding as the "[[best man]]", and paid for their lunch afterwards, which cost him 15 [[shillings]] per person.<ref name="Spitzp348"> Spitz 2005. p348</ref><ref name="Brownp83"> Brown, Peter. 2002. p83</ref> He later paid for a private room in a hospital (at twenty-seven shillings a day) during Cynthia's pregnancy, ensuring that she was registered under her [[maiden name]] of Powell.<ref name="Brownp93"> Brown, Peter. 2002. p93</ref> Epstein also offered the Lennons the sole use of his flat on Faulkner Street, Liverpool, when they needed somewhere to live, and agreed to be [[Julian Lennon]]'s [[godfather]] (Lennon and Cynthia's son).<ref name="Brownp83"> Brown, Peter. 2002. p83</ref><ref name=" CynthiaJohnp171"> Cynthia Lennon – “John” 2006. p171</ref>

===Sexual orientation===
Epstein was [[homosexual]], which was not publicly known until a long time after his death, although it was an open secret among his friends and business associates—including the Beatles.<ref name="Milesp88"> Miles 1998. p88</ref> 

Whilst Epstein was studying acting at RADA, he was arrested for "[[Cottaging|persistent importuning]]", and was later blackmailed by an ex-[[Coldstream Guards|Guardsman]]—Billy Connolly—which led to him dropping out after his third term. Throughout the later court case against Connolly, Epstein was referred to as "Mr. X", as the law allowed anonymity at that time.<ref name="Spitzp262"> Spitz 2005. p262</ref> McCartney said that the Beatles knew Epstein was a homosexual, but didn't care, because Epstein greatly encouraged them when record companies turned them down, and used to take them to late-night drinking clubs they had previously never had access to.<ref name="MilesPage88"> Miles 1998. p88</ref> Although Lennon often made sarcastic comments about Epstein's homosexuality to the Beatles and to Epstein personally, nobody outside their closed circle was allowed to comment on it. Ian Sharp—one of Lennon's art school friends—once made a sarcastic remark about Epstein but was sent a letter by Epstein's office within forty-eight hours that demanded a complete apology. Sharp apologised, but was completely ostracized by the Beatles, and was told by McCartney in a letter to have no contact at all with any of them in the future.<ref name="Spitzp302-303"> Spitz 2005. pp302-303</ref>

There were rumours of a brief sexual encounter between Lennon and Epstein when they both went on a four-day holiday together to Barcelona, [[Spain]] in April [[1963]]. Lennon (known for his unflinching candour) always denied this, telling ''[[Playboy]]'' in 1980: "It was never consummated, but we had a pretty intense relationship." Lennon's first wife Cynthia also maintains that Lennon's relationship with Epstein was platonic.<ref name=" CynthiaJohnp104"> Cynthia Lennon – “John” 2006. p104</ref> A fictionalised account of the Spanish holiday was portrayed in the film "The Hours and Times". One source, longtime Lennon friend and confidant [[Peter Shotton]], claimed in his book, ''The Beatles, Lennon and Me'', that under provocation from Epstein, Lennon did partly give in: "I let him [[Handjob|toss me off]], and that was it." Biographer [[Hunter Davies]] also recalled Lennon telling him he had consented to an encounter "to see what it was like." Writer [[Albert Goldman]] expanded on both claims in his ''[[The Lives of John Lennon]]'', alleging a longtime affair between the two men. Despite his soft-spoken manner and dapper appearance, Epstein was strongly attracted to "[[Trade (Homosexual)|rough trade]]", often seeking illicit encounters with abusive partners. He was the object of blackmail, battery, and threats by a number of these partners.<ref name="Spitzp262"> Spitz 2005. p262</ref>

Epstein's strongest relationship with a woman was with [[Alma Cogan]], who was also Jewish and was a part of the glitzy world of old-fashioned show business. Epstein always bought her presents when he was abroad with the Beatles, and even took her to Liverpool to meet his parents. Despite Epstein's preference for male company, some of his friends believed they would eventually get married.<ref name="Milesp138"> Miles 1998. p138</ref>

In October [[1964]], Epstein's [[autobiography]], ''A Cellarful of Noise'', was published in the UK and later in the US. It was co-written by journalist [[Derek Taylor]], who had served as Epstein's assistant that year, then later as publicist for The Beatles from [[1968]]-[[1970]]. (Lennon reportedly once quipped that the memoir should have been titled ''A Cellarful of Boys'').<ref name="EpsteininBillHarryBook">[http://213.87.37.135/oea/millennium/other/Books/billharry/EE.htm#Eamonn%20Andrews%20Show,%20The  Bill Harry book: Lennon’s book titles] Retrieved: 14 March 2007 </ref>

Male homosexual relations were illegal throughout UK until late 1967 (only one month after Epstein's death) when gay male sexuality was legalised in England and Wales (remaining illegal in Scotland and Northern Ireland until 1980 and 1982, respectively).

===Drug use===
After the start of his management of The Beatles, Epstein started taking [[amphetamines]]—usually [[Preludin]], which was legal at that time—which the Beatles also took and had previously taken in Hamburg. He explained his use of the drug as the only way of staying awake at night during The Beatles' numerous concert tours.<ref name="Spitzp301-302"> Spitz 2005. pp301-302</ref> In 1964, Brown started to notice that Epstein was taking too many pills, because Epstein often had a cough at parties, which Brown knew was Epstein's way of secretly putting pills into his mouth without anyone noticing.<ref name="Spitzp518"> Spitz 2005. p518</ref> McCartney often met Epstein at late-night clubs in London, and remembered that Epstein would often "grind his jaws", and once said, "Ugghhh, the pills..." to McCartney.<ref name="Milesp131"> Miles 1998. p131</ref>

In 1964, after having been introduced to [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] by [[Bob Dylan]] in [[New York]], McCartney remembered Epstein standing in front of a mirror, pointing at himself and repeatedly saying "Jew!", and laughing loudly, which McCartney found hilarious and "very liberating".<ref name="MilesPage188-189"> Miles 1998. pp188-189</ref> Epstein later became heavily involved in the 1960s drug scene, and during the four months when the Beatles were recording the [[Sgt. Pepper]] album Epstein spent his time on holiday, or at the [[Priory Group|Priory Clinic]], in [[Putney]], London, where he tried unsuccessfully to curb his drug use. He left the Priory for the party to launch "Sgt. Pepper" to selected journalists at his house at 24 Chapel Street, but went back to the Priory afterwards.<ref>[http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&GridE=-0.15093&GridN=51.49997&lon=-0.15093&lat=51.49997&place=Chapel%20Street%2C%20CITY%20OF%20WESTMINISTER%2C%20SW1&db=GB&scale=5000&search_result=Chapel%20Street%2C%20CITY%20OF%20WESTMINISTER%2C%20SW1&lang=&db=GB&keepicon=true  multimap.com: Location of Epstein’s Chapel Street house] Retrieved: 14 March 2007 </ref><ref name="Milesp337-338"> Miles 1998. pp337-338</ref> After McCartney's admission on [[19 June]] [[1967]], of his use of [[LSD]], Epstein defended McCartney to the Media—admitting that he had also taken it himself.<ref name="Spitzp699-670"> Spitz 2005. pp699-670</ref>

===Gambling===
When The Beatles were visiting [[Elvis Presley]] in America, [[Colonel Tom Parker]] showed Epstein a gambling table, and several packs of playing cards. Epstein straightened his [[bow tie]] and immediately wanted to play, as he was known for his love of [[gambling]] for high-stakes.<ref name="LipackEpoch"> Lipack. p57.</ref> McCartney frequently visited [[gambling]] clubs in London, such as the 'Curzon House' (which was Epstein's favourite club) and often saw Brian Epstein gambling there. McCartney once saw Epstein put a [[Alfred Dunhill, Ltd.|Dunhill lighter]] on the table that was worth £100, and then lose it during a game of cards. Epstein would often lose thousands of pounds by playing [[baccarat]] or [[Baccarat|chemin de fer]], but would stay at the Curzon House the whole evening—eating an expensive meal and drinking fine wines. The club never presented Epstein with a bill, as they knew that he lost so much in their [[casino]].<ref name="MilesPage131"> Miles 1998. p131</ref>

==Death==
<!-- Put references into this article from books (with page numbers)  or web pages -->
[[Image:be3.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Newspaper Headline: Epstein dies at 32.]]
A few weeks before his death, Epstein attended a traditional [[Shiva (Judaism)|shiva]] in Liverpool after his father's death, having just come out of the Priory clinic, where he had been trying to cure his acute [[insomnia]] and his addiction to amphetamines.<ref name="Milesp404-405"> Miles 1998. pp404-405</ref> Epstein's last visit to a Beatles' recording session was on [[23 August]] [[1967]], at the Chappell Recording Studios on Maddox street, London.<ref name="Milesp355"> Miles 1998. p355</ref> 

On Thursday [[24 August]], Epstein asked Brown and Geoffrey Ellis down to Kingsly Hall, which was his country home in [[Uckfield]], [[Sussex]], for the [[Bank Holiday]] weekend. After they got there, Epstein decided to drive back to London by himself because an expected group of people he had invited failed to arrive.<ref name="Milesp405"> Miles 1998. p405</ref> Epstein phoned Brown the next day at 5 o'clock in the afternoon from his Chapel Street house in London.<ref>[http://images.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://www.londontelevisionarchive.com/artwork/Beat%25209.jpg&imgrefurl=http://www.londontelevisionarchive.com/htdocs/beatles.html&h=221&w=121&sz=40&hl=en&start=28&tbnid=TsRtt6ICw3RBBM:&tbnh=107&tbnw=59&prev=/images%3Fq%3D%2522chapel%2Bstreet%2522%2B%252B%2BEpstein%26start%3D20%26gbv%3D2%26ndsp%3D20%26svnum%3D10%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DN  Photo of Epstein’s Chapel Street house] Retrieved: 15 March 2007 </ref> Brown thought that Epstein sounded "very groggy", and suggested that Epstein take a train back down to Kingsley Hall instead of driving under the influence of [[Tuinal|Tuinals]]. Epstein replied that he would eat something, read his mail and watch [[Juke Box Jury]] before phoning Brown to tell him which train to meet. He never called again.<ref name="Milesp405"> Miles 1998. p405</ref>  

Epstein died of a [[drug overdose]] on [[27 August]] [[1967]], the weekend The Beatles were in [[Bangor, Wales]], meeting with the Indian [[guru]] [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]].<ref name="OnThisDayEpstein">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/27/newsid_3767000/3767499.stm bbc.co.uk: On This Day – The death of Brian Epstein] Retrieved: 9 March 2007 </ref> Epstein had previously agreed to travel to Bangor and join the Beatles after the August Bank Holiday.<ref name="Milesp404"> Miles 1998. p404</ref> A concert by [[Jimi Hendrix]] was cancelled on the same day that Epstein died at the Saville Theatre (which Epstein leased) out of respect.<ref name="OnThisDayEpstein"/> At the statutory inquest, his death was officially ruled accidental, and was probably caused by a gradual buildup of [[Carbitral]] in his system, mixed with [[alcohol]]. It was revealed that he had taken six Carbitral pills in order to sleep, which was probably usual for Epstein, but meant that his tolerance was very close to becoming lethal.<ref name="Milesp405"> Miles 1998. p405</ref>    

Brown claimed in his memoir, ''The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles'', that he had once found a suicide note written by Epstein and spoke with him directly about it. According to Brown, the note read in part, "This is all too much and I can't take it anymore." A short will and testament followed, in which Epstein left his house and money to his mother and his brother (Brown himself was a small beneficiary). When confronted with the note, Epstein told Brown that he was grateful Brown had not told anyone about it, and told him that he was sorry he had made Brown worry. He explained that he had simply had taken one pill too many and that he didn't intend to overdose and promised to be more careful from then on. Brown later wrote that he should have given the note to Epstein's doctor, Norman Cowan, who would have stopped prescribing drugs for Epstein.

None of The Beatles were in attendance at Epstein's funeral—wishing to give his family privacy by not attracting the media and the Beatles' fans. A few weeks later, all four Beatles attended a memorial service for Epstein at the New London Synagogue in [[St. John's Wood]] (near the Abbey Road studios) which was officiated by Rabbi [[Louis Jacobs]], who eulogised Epstein, saying: “He encouraged young people to sing of love and peace rather than war and hatred.”<ref name="BiographyofEpstein"/><ref>[http://images.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://www.beatles.ws/hdstone.jpg&imgrefurl=http://www.beatles.ws/1967.htm&h=312&w=241&sz=25&hl=en&start=20&tbnid=PsHVwPyhgJ6UPM:&tbnh=117&tbnw=90&prev=/images%3Fq%3D%2522chapel%2Bstreet%2522%2B%252B%2BEpstein%26gbv%3D2%26svnum%3D10%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DG Epstein’s gravestone] Retrieved: 15 March 2007 </ref>

===Legacy===
<!-- Put references into this article from books (with page numbers)  or web pages -->
While The Beatles were among the earliest entrants into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], the man almost universally regarded as having been responsible for guiding them to their success has never been considered for membership in the Hall's "Non-Performer's Section".  Epstein was overlooked when all four of The Beatles were honoured with the [[Member of the Order of the British Empire|MBE]] in [[1965]] (even though Harrison once said that MBE stood for "Mister Brian Epstein"). Beatles' scholar and producer [[Martin Lewis]]—a protegé of Derek Taylor—has become a vocal champion of Epstein's memory, creating "The Official Brian Epstein Website", which includes a [[petition]] that Epstein be inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref name="EpsteindotCom">[http://www.brianepstein.com/ brianepstein.com   brianepstein.com] Retrieved: 15 March 2007 </ref> Lewis also organized the 1998 re-publication—in the U.S.—of Epstein's 1964 autobiography ''A Cellarful Of Noise''.

McCartney summarised the importance of Epstein to The Beatles when he was interviewed, in 1997, for a BBC documentary about Epstein. He stated: "If anyone was the Fifth Beatle, it was Brian." <ref>[http://www.brianepstein.com/cellarful.html brianepstein.com: McCartney's comments about the fifth Beatle] Retrieved: 12 March 2007 </ref> In his 1970 [[Rolling Stone]] interview, John Lennon commented about Epstein's death: "I knew that we were in trouble then... I thought, we've fuckin' had it!"<ref name="Milesp406"> Miles 1998. p406</ref>
