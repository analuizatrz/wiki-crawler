'''Ammonia''' is a [[chemical compound|compound]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] [[nitrogen|N]][[hydrogen|H<sub>3</sub>]]. It is normally encountered as a [[gas]] with a characteristic pungent [[odor]].  Ammonia contributes significantly to the nutritional needs of terrestrial organisms by serving as a precursor to foodstuffs and fertilizers.  Ammonia, either directly or indirectly, is also a building block for the synthesis of many [[pharmaceuticals]].  Although in wide use, ammonia is both [[Caustic (substance)|caustic]] and hazardous. In 2006, worldwide production was estimated at 146.5 million tonnes.<ref name=Ullmann>Max Appl "Ammonia" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2006, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a02_143.pub2}} Article Online Posting Date: December 15, 2006</ref>

Ammonia, as used commercially, is often called ''anhydrous ammonia.'' This term emphasizes the absence of water in the material.  Because NH<sub>3</sub> boils at -33 °C, the liquid must be stored under high pressure or at low temperature.  Its [[heat of vaporization]] is, however, sufficiently great that NH<sub>3</sub> can be readily handled in ordinary beakers in a [[fume hood]].  "Household ammonia" or "[[ammonium hydroxide]]" is a solution of NH<sub>3</sub> in water.  The strength of such solutions is measured in units of [[Baumé scale|baume]] ([[density]]), with 26 degrees baume (about 30 weight percent ammonia at 15.5 °C) being the typical high concentration commercial product.<ref name=LaRoche>[http://www.airgasspecialtyproducts.com/UserFiles/laroche/PDF/AAPhysical.pdf Ammonium hydroxide physical properties]</ref> Household ammonia ranges in concentration from 5 to 10 weight percent ammonia.

==Structure and basic chemical properties==
The ammonia molecule has a [[Trigonal pyramid (chemistry)|trigonal pyramidal]] shape, as predicted by [[VSEPR theory]].  The [[nitrogen]] atom in the molecule has a [[Lone pair|lone electron pair]], and ammonia acts as a [[Base (chemistry)|base]], a proton acceptor. This shape gives the molecule a [[dipole]] moment and makes it [[Polar molecule|polar]] so that ammonia readily dissolves in [[Water (molecule)|water]].  The degree to which ammonia forms the ammonium ion increases upon lowering the [[pH]] of the [[solution]]&mdash; at "physiological" pH (~7), about 67% of the ammonia molecules are [[Protonation|protonated]].  Temperature and salinity also affect the proportion of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>.   NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> has the shape of a regular [[tetrahedron]].

The main use of ammonia is for production of [[fertilizer]] (83% in 2003).  Another major application is its conversion to [[explosive]]s, because nitric acid is made via oxidation of ammonia.  The ''entire'' nitrogen content of all manufactured [[organic compound]]s is derived from ammonia.<ref name=Ullmann/>

===Natural occurrence===
Ammonia is found in small quantities in the atmosphere, being produced from the [[putrefaction]] of nitrogenous animal and vegetable matter. Ammonia and ammonium salts are also found in small quantities in rainwater, whereas [[ammonium chloride]] (sal-ammoniac), and [[ammonium sulfate]] are found in volcanic districts; crystals of [[ammonium bicarbonate]] have been found in [[Patagonia]]n [[guano]].  The [[kidney]]s secrete NH<sub>3</sub> to neutralize excess acid.<ref name= >ammonia is a purple gas.[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=10360635&dopt=Urine electrolytes and the urine anion and osmolar gaps.]</ref>  Ammonium salts also are found distributed through all fertile soil and in seawater.  Substances containing ammonia, or those that are similar to it, are called ''ammoniacal''.

==History==   
The Romans called the [[ammonium chloride]] deposits they collected from near the Temple of Jupiter [[Amun]] ([[Greek language|Greek]] Ἄμμων ''Ammon'') in [[ancient Libya]] 'sal ammoniacus' (salt of Amun) because of proximity to the nearby temple.<ref>{{cite web | title = Ammonia| work = h2g2 Eponyms | publisher = BBC.CO.UK | date = 2003-01-11 | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/alabaster/A632990| accessdate = 2007-11-08 }}</ref> Salts of ammonia have been known from very early times; thus the term ''Hammoniacus sal''<ref name="Mineral Data">[http://webmineral.com/data/Sal-ammoniac.shtml Webmineral website] URL last accessed August 27 2006</ref> appears in the writings of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], although it is not known whether the term is identical with the more modern ''sal-ammoniac''.<ref name="Mineral Data"/> 

In the form of sal-ammoniac, ammonia was known to the [[Alchemy and chemistry in Islam|Arabic alchemists]] as early as the 8th century, first mentioned by [[Geber]] (Jabir ibn Hayyan),<ref name=Hassan>[[Ahmad Y Hassan]], [http://www.history-science-technology.com/Articles/articles%2072.htm Transfer Of Islamic Technology To The West, Part II: Transmission Of Islamic Engineering], ''History of Science and Technology in Islam''.</ref> and to the European [[Alchemy|alchemists]] since the 13th century, being mentioned by [[Albertus Magnus]].<ref name="astronomy">[http://www.absoluteastronomy.com/ref/ammonia Absolouteastronomy.com] URL last accessed April 24 2006</ref> It was also used by [[dye]]rs in the [[Middle Ages]] in the form of fermented [[urine]]<ref name="astronomy"/> to alter the colour of vegetable dyes.  In the 15th century, [[Basilius Valentinus]] showed that ammonia could be obtained by the action of alkalis on sal-ammoniac.  At a later period, when sal-ammoniac was obtained by distilling the hoofs and horns of oxen and neutralizing the resulting carbonate with [[hydrochloric acid]], the name "spirit of hartshorn" was applied to ammonia.<ref name="astronomy"/>

Gaseous ammonia was first isolated by [[Joseph Priestley]] in 1774 and was termed by him ''alkaline air''; however it was acquired by the alchemist [[Basil Valentine]].<ref name="Alchemy" > Abraham, Lyndy.  Marvell and alchemy.  Aldershot Scolar 1990.</ref> Eleven years later in 1785, [[Claude Louis Berthollet]] ascertained its composition.  

The [[Haber process]] to produce ammonia from the nitrogen in the air was developed by [[Fritz Haber]] and [[Carl Bosch]] in 1909 and patented in 1910.  It was first used on an industrial scale by the Germans during [[World War I]],<ref name=Ullmann/> following the allied blockade that cut off the supply of nitrates from [[Chile]].  The ammonia was used to produce explosives to sustain their war effort.<ref name="Conquering" >Smith, Roland.  Conquering Chemistry 2001</ref>

Prior to the advent of cheap natural gas, hydrogen as a precursor to ammonia production was produced via the  electrolysis of water.  The [[Vemork]] 60 MW hydroelectric plant in Norway constructed in 1911 was used purely for this purpose and up until the second world war provided the majority of Europe's ammonia.

==Synthesis and production==
''see [[Haber Process]]''

Because of its many uses, ammonia is one of the most highly produced inorganic chemicals.  Dozens of [[chemical plant]]s worldwide produce ammonia. The worldwide [[ammonia production]] in 2004 was 109&nbsp;million [[metric tonnes]].<ref name="usgs">[http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/nitrogen/nitromcs05.pdf United States Geological Survey publication]</ref> The [[People's Republic of China]] produced 28.4% of the worldwide production followed by [[India]] with 8.6%, [[Russia]] with 8.4%, and the [[United States]] with 8.2%.<ref name="usgs"/> About 80% or more of the ammonia produced is used for fertilizing agricultural crops.<ref name="usgs"/>

Before the start of [[World War I]], most ammonia was obtained by the [[dry distillation]]<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/chemistry/laureates/1918/press.html Nobel Prize in Chemistry (1918)] - [[Haber process]]. URL last accessed April 24 2006</ref> of nitrogenous vegetable and animal waste products, including [[camel]] [[manure|dung]], where it was [[distillation|distilled]] by the reduction of [[nitrous acid]] and [[nitrite]]s with [[hydrogen]]; in addition, it was produced by the distillation of [[coal]], and also by the decomposition of ammonium salts by [[alkaline]] hydroxides<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A1002934 BBC.co.uk] URL last accessed April 24 2006</ref> such as [[calcium oxide|quicklime]], the salt most generally used being the chloride ([[ammonium chloride|sal-ammoniac]]) thus:

::2 NH<sub>4</sub>Cl + 2 CaO → CaCl<sub>2</sub> + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> + 2 NH<sub>3</sub>

(Two molecules of ammonium chloride plus two calcium oxide yields calcium chloride and calcium hydroxide and two molecules of ammonia)

Today, the typical modern ammonia-producing plant first converts [[natural gas]] (i.e., [[methane]]) or [[liquified petroleum gas]] (such gases are [[propane]] and [[butane]]) or petroleum [[naphtha]] into gaseous [[hydrogen]].  The processes used in producing the hydrogen begins with removal of [[sulfur]] compounds from the natural gas (because sulfur deactivates the [[catalyst]]s used in subsequent steps).  Catalytic [[hydrogenation]]  converts organosulfur compounds into gaseous [[hydrogen sulfide]]:
::H<sub>2</sub> + RSH →  RH + H<sub>2</sub>S(''g'')

*The hydrogen sulfide is then removed by passing the gas through beds of [[zinc oxide]] where it is absorbed and converted to solid [[zinc sulfide]]:
::H<sub>2</sub>S + ZnO → ZnS + H<sub>2</sub>O

* Catalytic [[steam reforming]] of the sulfur-free feedstock is then used to form hydrogen plus [[carbon monoxide]]:
::CH<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O → CO + 3 H<sub>2</sub>

* In the next step, the [[water gas shift reaction]] is used to convert the [[carbon monoxide]] into [[carbon dioxide]] and more hydrogen:
::CO + H<sub>2</sub>O → CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>

* The carbon dioxide is then removed either by absorption in aqueous [[ethanolamine]] solutions or by [[adsorption]] in [[Pressure Swing Adsorption|pressure swing adsorbers]] (PSA) using proprietary solid adsorption media.

* The final step in producing the hydrogen is to use catalytic methanation to remove any small residual amounts of carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide from the hydrogen:
::CO + 3 H<sub>2</sub> → CH<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O
::CO<sub>2</sub> + 4 H<sub>2</sub> → CH<sub>4</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O

* To produce the desired end-product ammonia, the hydrogen is then catalytically reacted with nitrogen (derived from process air) to form anhydrous liquid ammonia. This step is known as the ammonia synthesis loop (also referred to as the [[Haber-Bosch]] process):

::3 H<sub>2</sub> + N<sub>2</sub> → 2 NH<sub>3</sub>

[[Hydrogen]] required for ammonia synthesis could in principle be obtained from other sources, but these alternatives - apart from the electrolysis of water into oxygen + hydrogen - are presently impractical.  
At one time, most of Europe's ammonia was produced from the Hydro plant at [[Vemork]], via the electrolysis route.  Various renewable energy electricity sources are also potentially applicable.

==Biosynthesis==
In certain organisms, ammonia is produced from atmospheric N<sub>2</sub> by [[enzyme]]s called [[nitrogenase]]s.  The overall process is called [[nitrogen fixation]].   Although it is unlikely that biomimetic methods will be developed that are competitive with the [[Haber process]], intense effort has been directed toward understanding the mechanism of biological nitrogen fixation. The scientific interest in this problem is motivated by the unusual structure of the active site of the enzyme, which consists of an Fe<sub>7</sub>MoS<sub>9</sub> ensemble.

Ammonia is also a metabolic product of [[amino acid]] [[deamination]]. Ammonia excretion is common in aquatic animals. In humans, it is quickly converted to [[urea]], which is much less toxic. This urea is a major component of the dry weight of [[urine]]. Most reptiles, including birds, as well as insects and snails solely excrete uric acid as nitrogenous waste.

== Properties ==
Ammonia is a colorless [[gas]] with a characteristic pungent smell. It is [[lighter than air]], its density being 0.589 times that of [[Earth's atmosphere|air]]. It is easily liquefied due to the strong hydrogen bonding between molecules; the [[liquid]] boils at -33.3 °C, and solidifies at -77.7 °C to white crystals. [[Liquid]] ammonia possesses strong [[ion]]izing powers reflecting its high [[Dielectric constant|ε]] of 22. Liquid ammonia has a very high [[standard enthalpy change of vaporization]] (23.35&nbsp;[[Joule|kJ]]/mol, ''cf.'' [[water (molecule)|water]] 40.65&nbsp;kJ/mol, [[methane]] 8.19&nbsp;kJ/mol, [[phosphine]] 14.6&nbsp;kJ/mol) and can therefore be used in laboratories in non-insulated vessels without additional refrigeration. 

It is [[miscible]] with water. Ammonia in an aqueous solution can be expelled by boiling. The [[water|aqueous]] solution of ammonia is [[Base (chemistry)|basic]]. The maximum concentration of ammonia in water (a [[saturation (chemistry)|saturated]] solution) has a [[density]] of 0.880 g /[[cubic centimetre|cm³]] and is often known as '.880 Ammonia'. Ammonia does not burn readily or sustain [[combustion]], except under narrow fuel-to-air mixtures of 15-25% air. When mixed with [[oxygen]], it burns with a pale yellowish-green flame. At high temperature and in the presence of a suitable catalyst, ammonia is decomposed into its constituent elements.  Ignition occurs when [[chlorine]] is passed into ammonia, forming nitrogen and [[hydrogen chloride]]; if ammonia is present in excess, then the highly explosive [[nitrogen trichloride]] (NCl<sub>3</sub>) is also formed. 

The ammonia molecule readily undergoes [[nitrogen inversion]] at room temperature; a useful analogy is an [[umbrella]] turning itself inside out in a strong wind. The energy barrier to this inversion is 24.7 kJ/mol, and the [[resonance frequency]] is 23.79 [[Hertz|GHz]], corresponding to [[microwave]] radiation of a [[wavelength]] of 1.260 cm. The absorption at this frequency was the first [[Microwave spectroscopy|microwave spectrum]] to be observed.<ref name="Cleeton">[[Claud E. Cleeton|C. E. Cleeton]] & [[Neal H. Williams|N. H. Williams]], 1934 - [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v45/i4/p234_1 Online version; archive]. URL last accessed 8 May 2006</ref>

===Basicity ===
One of the most characteristic properties of ammonia is its basicity.  It combines with [[acid]]s to form [[salt]]s; thus with [[hydrochloric acid]] it forms [[ammonium chloride]] (sal-ammoniac); with [[nitric acid]], [[ammonium nitrate]], etc. However perfectly dry ammonia will not combine with perfectly dry [[hydrogen chloride]]: moisture is necessary to bring about the reaction.<ref>Baker, H. B. (1894). ''J. Chem. Soc.'' volume 65: p. 612.</ref>
::NH<sub>3</sub>  +  [[Hydrogen chloride|HCl]]  →  [[Ammonium chloride|NH<sub>4</sub>Cl]]

The salts produced by the action of ammonia on acids are known as the [[:Category:Ammonium compounds|ammonium salts]] and all contain the [[ammonium]] [[ion]] (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>).  Anhydrous ammonia is often used for the [[Methamphetamine#Illicit production|production of methamphetamine]].

=== Acidity ===
Although ammonia is well-known as a base, it can also act as an extremely weak [[acid]]. It is a protic substance, and is capable of formation of [[amide]]s (which contain the NH<sub>2</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> ion), for example  when solid [[lithium nitride]] is added to liquid ammonia, forming a [[lithium amide]] solution:

::Li<sub>3</sub>N<sub>(''s'')</sub>+ 2 NH<sub>3 (''l'')</sub> → 3 Li<sup>+</sup><sub>(''am'')</sub> + 3 NH<sub>2</sub><sup>&minus;</sup><sub>(''am'')</sub>

In this [[Brønsted–Lowry]] acid-base reaction, ammonia serves as an acid.

=== Combustion ===
The combustion of ammonia to [[nitrogen]] and [[water]] is [[exothermic]]:
::4NH<sub>3</sub> + 3O<sub>2</sub> → 2N<sub>2</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>O (''g'') [[Standard enthalpy change of reaction|Δ''H''º<sub>r</sub>]] = –1267.20 kJ/mol
The [[standard enthalpy change of combustion]], Δ''H''º<sub>c</sub>, expressed per [[mole]] of ammonia and with condensation of the water formed, is –382.81&nbsp;kJ/mol. Dinitrogen is the thermodynamic product of combustion: all [[nitrogen oxide]]s are unstable with respect to nitrogen and [[oxygen]], which is the principle behind the [[catalytic converter]]. However, nitrogen oxides can be formed as kinetic products in the presence of appropriate [[catalyst]]s, a reaction of great industrial importance in the production of [[nitric acid]].
::4NH<sub>3</sub> + 5O<sub>2</sub> → 4NO + 6H<sub>2</sub>O

The combustion of ammonia in air is very difficult in the absence of a catalyst (such as [[platinum]] gauze), as the temperature of the flame is usually lower than the ignition temperature of the ammonia-air mixture. The flammable range of ammonia in air is 16–25%.<ref>{{Greenwood&Earnshaw1st|page=485}}</ref>

===Formation of other compounds ===
In [[organic chemistry]], ammonia can act as a [[nucleophile]] in [[Nucleophilic substitution|substitution]] reactions. [[Amine]]s can be formed by the reaction of ammonia with [[alkyl halide]]s, although the resulting &ndash;NH<sub>2</sub> group is also nucleophilic and secondary and tertiary amines are often formed as by-products. An excess of ammonia helps minimise multiple substitution, and neutralises the [[hydrogen halide]] formed. [[Methylamine]] is prepared commercially by the reaction of ammonia with [[chloromethane]], and the reaction of ammonia with 2-bromopropanoic acid has been used to prepare [[racemic]] [[alanine]] in 70% yield. [[Ethanolamine]] is prepared by a ring-opening reaction with [[ethylene oxide]]: the reaction is sometimes allowed to go further to produce [[diethanolamine]] and [[triethanolamine]].

[[Amide]]s can be prepared by the reaction of ammonia with a number of [[carboxylic acid]] derivatives. [[Acyl chloride]]s are the most reactive, but the ammonia must be present in at least a twofold excess to neutralise the [[hydrogen chloride]] formed. [[Ester]]s and [[anhydride]]s also react with ammonia to form amides. Ammonium salts of carboxylic acids can be [[Dehydration|dehydrated]] to amides so long as there are no thermally sensitive groups present: temperatures of 150&ndash;200 °C are required. 

The [[hydrogen]] in ammonia is capable of replacement by [[metal]]s, thus [[magnesium]] burns in the gas with the formation of [[magnesium nitride]] Mg<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>, and when the gas is passed over heated [[sodium]] or [[potassium]], sodamide, NaNH<sub>2</sub>, and potassamide, KNH<sub>2</sub>, are formed. Where necessary in [[IUPAC nomenclature|substitutive nomenclature]], [[IUPAC]] recommendations prefer the name '''azane''' to ammonia: hence [[chloramine]] would be named ''chloroazane'' in substitutive nomenclature, not ''chloroammonia''.

=== Ammonia as a ligand ===
[[Image:TetraAmmineDiAquaCopper.png‎|thumb|right|200px|[[Ball-and-stick model]] of the tetraamminediaquacopper(II) cation, [Cu(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>]]

[[Image:Diamminesilver(I)-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|200px|Ball-and-stick model of the diamminesilver(I) cation, [Ag(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup>]]

Ammonia can act as a [[ligand]] in [[transition metal]] [[complex (chemistry)|complexes]]. It is a pure σ-donor, in the middle of the [[spectrochemical series]], and shows intermediate [[HSAB concept|hard-soft]] behaviour. For historical reasons, ammonia is named '''ammine''' in the nomenclature of [[coordination compound]]s. Some notable ammine complexes include:
*'''Tetraamminediaquacopper(II)''', [Cu(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>, a characteristic dark blue complex formed by adding ammonia to solution of copper(II) salts. Known as [[Schweizer's reagent]].
*'''Diamminesilver(I)''', [Ag(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup>, the active species in [[Tollens' reagent]]. Formation of this complex can also help to distinguish between precipitates of the different silver halides: [[Silver chloride|AgCl]] is soluble in dilute (2M) ammonia solution, [[Silver bromide|AgBr]] is only soluble in concentrated ammonia solution while [[Silver iodide|AgI]] is insoluble in aqueous solution of ammonia.

Ammine complexes of [[chromium]](III) were known in the late 19th century, and formed the basis of [[Alfred Werner]]'s theory of coordination compounds. Werner noted that only two isomers (''fac''- and ''mer''-) of the complex [CrCl<sub>3</sub>(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>] could be formed, and concluded that the ligands must be arranged around the metal ion at the [[wikt:vertex|vertices]] of an [[octahedron]]. This has since been confirmed by [[X-ray crystallography]].

An ammine ligand bound to a metal ion is markedly more [[acid]]ic than a free ammonia molecule, although deprotonation in aqueous solution is still rare. One example is the [[Mercury(I) chloride|Calomel reaction]], where the resulting amidomercury(II) compound is highly insoluble.
::Hg<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> + 2 NH<sub>3</sub> → Hg + HgCl(NH<sub>2</sub>) + NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> + Cl<sup>&minus;</sup>

==Uses==
===Fertilizer===
Approximately 83% (as of 2003) of ammonia is used as fertilizers either as its salts or as solutions.  Consuming more than 1% of all man-made power, the production of ammonia is a significant component of the world energy budget.<ref name=Ullmann/>

===Precursor to nitrogenous compounds===
Ammonia is directly or indirectly the precursor to most nitrogen-containing compounds.  Practically all synthetic and all inorganic nitrogen compounds are prepared from ammonia. An important derivative is [[nitric acid]].  This key material is generated via the [[Ostwald process]] by [[oxidisation]] of ammonia with air over a [[platinum]] [[catalyst]] at 700 - 850 °C, ~9 atm.  [[Nitric oxide]] is an intermediate:<ref>Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. "Inorganic Chemistry" Academic Press: San Diego, 2001. ISBN 0-12-352651-5.</ref>
: NH<sub>3</sub>  +  2 O<sub>2</sub>  →   HNO<sub>3</sub>  +  H<sub>2</sub>O 
Nitric acid is used for the production of [[fertilizer]]s, [[explosive]]s, and natural organonitrogen  other chemical compounds.

===Minor and emerging uses===
====Refrigeration - R717====
Ammonia's thermodynamic properties made it one of the [[refrigerants]] commonly used prior to the discovery of [[dichlorodifluoromethane]].<ref>[http://www.wou.edu/~avorder/Refrigeration.htm Dichlorodifluoromethane] by Aaron Vorderstrasse, Western Oregon University.</ref> Ammonia's toxicity complicates this application.   Anhydrous ammonia is widely used in industrial refrigeration applications because of its high [[energy efficiency]] and low cost. Ammonia is used less frequently in commercial applications, such as in grocery store freezer cases and refrigerated displays due to its toxicity.

====For remediation of gaseous emissions====
Ammonia used to scrub SO<sub>2</sub> from the burning of fossil fuels, the resulting product is converted to ammonium sulfate for use as fertilizer. Ammonia neutralizes the nitrogen oxides (NOx) pollutants emitted by diesel engines. This technology, called SCR (selective catalytic reduction), relies on a vanadia-based [[catalyst]].<ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/mar2008/db20080321_748642_page_3.htm Diesel: Greener Than You Think<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

====As a fuel====
Ammonia was used during [[World War II]] to power buses in Belgium, and in engine and solar energy applications prior to 1900.  Liquid ammonia was used as the fuel of the rocket airplane, the [[X-15]]. Although not as powerful as other fuels, it left no soot in the reusable rocket engine and its density approximately matches that for the oxidizer, liquid oxygen, which simplified the aircraft's design. 
===As a vehicle fuel===
Ammonia is proposed as a practical and clean  alternative to [[fossil fuel]] for [[internal combustion engines]]. Essentially ammonia has no serious issues, as an alternative vehicle fuel compared to petrol or diesel, including toxicity, flammability, use in engines, pollution, energy density . It does requires twice the storage volume of petrol/diesel. It can run in existing engines. It is already widely produced and distributed, and can be manufactured from renewable energy sources, coal or nuclear power. The main down side is that overall it is somewhat less efficient than batteries, but batteries don't yet exist with comparable energy densities to ammonia are very heavy, and consume vast amounts of scarce resources in their manufacture. The 60 MW Rjukan dam in Telemark Norway, was producing ammonia via electrolysis of water for many years from 1913 producing fertilizer for much of Europe. Ammonia is already produced, transported and stored on a vast scale. It an be used in existing engines with only minor modifications to carburetors / injectors. If produced from coal, the CO2 can be readily sequestrated.<ref>[http://www.claverton-energy.com/download/159/ Ammonia as a Transportation Fuel IV San Francisco October 15-16 , 2007 Norm Olson –Iowa Energy Center

MacKenzie, J.J.; Avery, W.H. World Resources Inst., Washington, DC.</ref>

The calorific value of ammonia is 22.5 MJ/kg (9690 [[BTU]]/lb) which is about half that of diesel. In a normal engine, in which the water vapour is not condensed, the calorific value of ammonia will be about 21% less than this figure.

====Textile====
Liquid ammonia is used for treatment of cotton materials, give a properties like mercerisation using alkalies. And also used for pre-washing of wool.

====Poison treatment====
Solutions of ammonia in water can be applied on the skin to lessen the effects of acidic animal poisons, especially insect poison and [[jellyfish]] poison.

== Ammonia's role in biologic systems and human disease ==
Ammonia is an important source of nitrogen for living systems. Although atmospheric nitrogen abounds, few living creatures are capable of utilizing this nitrogen. Nitrogen is required for the synthesis of amino acids, which are the building blocks of [[protein]]. Some plants rely on ammonia and other nitrogenous wastes incorporated into the soil by decaying matter. Others, such as nitrogen-fixing [[legume]]s, benefit from [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationships with [[rhizobia]] which create ammonia from atmospheric nitrogen.<ref>M.B. Adjei, K.H. Quesenberry and C.G. Chamblis. ''Nitrogen Fixation and Inoculation of Forage Legumes'' [http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/AG152 University of Florida IFAS Extension] June 2002.</ref>

Ammonia also plays a role in both normal and abnormal animal [[physiology]]. Ammonia is created through normal amino acid metabolism and is toxic in high concentrations.<ref>[http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?sid=10323059 PubChem Substance Summary], last accessed [[7 May]] [[2007]]</ref>  The [[liver]] converts ammonia to [[urea]] through a series of reactions known as the [[urea cycle]]. Liver dysfunction, such as that seen in [[cirrhosis]], may lead to elevated amounts of ammonia in the blood ([[hyperammonemia]]). Likewise, defects in the enzymes responsible for the urea cycle, such as [[ornithine transcarbamylase]], lead to hyperammonemia. Hyperammonemia contributes to the confusion and [[coma]] of [[hepatic encephalopathy]] as well as the neurologic disease common in people with urea cycle defects and [[organic aciduria]]s.<ref>Zschocke, Johannes, and Georg Hoffman. ''Vademecum Metabolism.'' Friedrichsdorf, Germany: Milupa GmbH, 2004.</ref>

Ammonia is important for normal animal acid/base balance. After formation of ammonium from [[glutamine]], [[α-ketoglutarate]] may be degraded to produce two molecules of [[bicarbonate]] which are then available as buffers for dietary acids. Ammonium is excreted in the urine resulting in net acid loss. Ammonia may itself diffuse across the renal tubules, combine with a hydrogen ion, and thus allow for further acid excretion.<ref>Rose, Burton, and Helmut Rennke. ''Renal Pathophysiology.'' Baltimore, Maryland: Williams & Wilkins, 1994.</ref>

===Excretion===
{{main|Excretion}}
Ammonium ions are a [[toxic]] waste product of the [[metabolism]] in [[animal]]s. In fishes and aquatic invertebrates, it is excreted directly into the water. In mammals, sharks, and amphibians, it is converted in the [[urea cycle]] to [[urea]], because it is less toxic and can be stored more efficiently. In birds, reptiles, and terrestrial snails, metabolic ammonium is converted into [[uric acid]], which is solid, and can therefore be excreted with minimal water loss.<ref>{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Neil A. |authorlink=Neil Campbell (scientist) |coauthors=[[Jane Reece|Jane B. Reece]] |title=Biology |edition=6th edition |year=2002 |publisher=Pearson Education, Inc. |location=San Francisco, California  |isbn=0-8053-6624-5 |pages=937–938 |chapter=44}}</ref>

===Theoretical role in alternative biochemistry===
Ammonia has been proposed as a possible replacement for water as a bodily solvent in the theoretical [[alternative biochemistries]] of lifeforms that do not use [[carbon]] for cellular structure and [[water]] as a solvent to dissolve bodily solutes and allow essential parts of metabolic processes to occur. It has been suggested that ammonia would be most favorable for lifeforms that live in temperatures below the freezing point of water{{Fact|date=December 2007}}.

== Liquid ammonia as a solvent ==
:''See also: [[Inorganic nonaqueous solvent]]''
Liquid ammonia is the best-known and most widely studied non-aqueous ionizing solvent. Its most conspicuous property is its ability to dissolve alkali metals to form highly coloured, electrically conducting solutions containing [[solvated electron]]s. Apart from these remarkable solutions, much of the chemistry in liquid ammonia can be classified by analogy with related reactions in aqueous solutions. Comparison of the physical properties of NH<sub>3</sub> with those of water shows that NH<sub>3</sub> has the lower melting point, boiling point, density, [[viscosity]], [[dielectric constant]] and [[electrical conductivity]]; this is due at least in part to the weaker H bonding in NH<sub>3</sub> and the fact that such bonding cannot form cross-linked networks since each NH<sub>3</sub> molecule has only 1 lone-pair of electrons compared with 2 for each H<sub>2</sub>O molecule. The ionic self-[[dissociation constant]] of liquid NH<sub>3</sub> at &minus;50 °C is approx. 10<sup>-33</sup> mol²·l<sup>-2</sup>.

Liquid ammonia is an ionizing solvent, although less so than water, and dissolves a range of ionic compounds including many [[nitrate]]s, [[nitrite]]s, [[cyanide]]s and [[thiocyanate]]s.  Most [[ammonium]] salts are soluble, and these salts act as [[acid]]s in liquid ammonia solutions. The solubility of [[halide]] salts increases from [[fluoride]] to [[iodide]]. A saturated solution of [[ammonium nitrate]] contains 0.83 mol solute per mole of ammonia, and has a [[vapour pressure]] of less than 1&nbsp;bar even at 25 °C.

=== Solutions of metals ===
:''See also: [[Solvated electron]], [[metallic solution]]''
Liquid ammonia will dissolve the [[alkali metal]]s and other [[Electronegativity|electropositive]] metals such as [[calcium]], [[strontium]], [[barium]], [[europium]] and [[ytterbium]]. At low concentrations (<0.06 mol/L), deep blue solutions are formed: these contain metal cations and [[solvated electron]]s, free electrons which are surrounded by a cage of ammonia molecules. 

These solutions are very useful as strong reducing agents. At higher concentrations, the solutions are metallic in appearance and in electrical conductivity. At low temperatures, the two types of solution can coexist as [[Wiktionary:immiscible|immiscible]] phases.

The range of thermodynamic stability of liquid ammonia solutions is very narrow, as the potential for oxidation to [[Nitrogen|dinitrogen]], [[Standard electrode potential|''E''°]] (N<sub>2</sub> + 6NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> + 6e<sup>&minus;</sup> {{unicode|⇌}} 8NH<sub>3</sub>), is only +0.04&nbsp;V. In practice, both oxidation to dinitrogen and reduction to [[Hydrogen|dihydrogen]] are slow. This is particularly true of reducing solutions: the solutions of the alkali metals mentioned above are stable for several days, slowly decomposing to the [[Amide|metal amide]] and dihydrogen. Most studies involving liquid ammonia solutions are done in reducing conditions: although oxidation of liquid ammonia is usually slow, there is still a risk of explosion, particularly if transition metal ions are present as possible catalysts.

== Detection and determination ==
Ammonia and ammonium salts can be readily detected, in very minute traces, by the addition of [[Nessler's solution]], which gives a distinct yellow coloration in the presence of the least trace of ammonia or ammonium salts. [[Sulfur sticks]] are burnt to detect small leaks in industrial ammonia refrigeration systems. Larger quantities can be detected by warming the salts with a caustic alkali or with [[calcium oxide|quicklime]], when the characteristic smell of ammonia will be at once apparent. The amount of ammonia in ammonium salts can be estimated quantitatively by distillation of the salts with [[sodium hydroxide|sodium]] or [[potassium hydroxide]], the ammonia evolved being absorbed in a known volume of standard [[sulfuric acid]] and the excess of acid then determined [[volumetric analysis|volumetrically]]; or the ammonia may be absorbed in [[hydrochloric acid]] and the [[ammonium chloride]] so formed precipitated as [[ammonium hexachloroplatinate]], (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub>.

===Interstellar space===
Ammonia was first detected in interstellar space in 1968, based on [[microwave]] emissions from the direction of the [[Milky Way|galactic core]].<ref> A.C. Cheung, D.M. Rank, C.H. Townes, D.D. Thornton, and W.J. Welch, 1968, "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1968PhRvL.21.1701C Detection of NH3 molecules in the interstellar medium by their microwave emission]," ''Phys. Rev. Lett.'' 21, 1701.</ref> This was the first [[polyatomic]] molecule to be so detected.
The sensitivity of the molecule to a broad range of excitations and the ease with which it can be observed in a number of regions has made ammonia one of the most important molecules for studies of [[molecular cloud]]s.<ref>P. T. P. Ho and C.H. Townes, 1983,
"[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1983ARA&A.21.239H Interstellar ammonia], ''Ann. Rev. Astron. Astrophys.'', vol. 21, pp. 239-70.</ref> The relative intensity of the ammonia lines can be used to measure the temperature of the emitting medium.

The following isotopic species of ammonia have been detected:
:NH<sub>3</sub>, [[Isotopes of nitrogen|<sup>15</sup>N]]H<sub>3</sub>, NH<sub>2</sub>[[Deuterium|D]], NHD<sub>2</sub>, and ND<sub>3</sub>
The detection of triply-[[deuterium|deuterated]] ammonia was considered a surprise as deuterium is relatively scarce. It is thought that the low-temperature conditions allow this molecule to survive and accumulate.<ref>T. J. Millar, "Deuterium Fractionation in Interstellar Clouds", ''Space Science Reviews'', Vol. 106, Issue 1, pp 73-86.</ref> The ammonia molecule has also been detected in the atmospheres of the [[gas giant]] planets, including [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]], along with other gases like [[methane]], [[hydrogen]], and [[helium]]. The interior of Saturn may include frozen crystals of ammonia.<ref>Edited by Kirk Munsell. Image page credit Lunar and Planetary Institute. NASA.

== Safety precautions ==
=== Toxicity and storage information ===
[[Image:Hydrochloric acid ammonia.jpg|thumb|Hydrochloric acid sample releasing HCl fumes which are reacting with ammonia fumes to produce a white smoke of ammonium chloride.]]
The toxicity of ammonia solutions does not usually cause problems for humans and other mammals, as a specific mechanism exists to prevent its build-up  in the bloodstream. Ammonia is converted to [[carbamoyl phosphate]] by the enzyme [[carbamoyl phosphate synthetase]], and then enters the [[urea cycle]] to be either incorporated into [[amino acid]]s or excreted in the urine. However [[fish]] and [[amphibian]]s lack this mechanism, as they can usually eliminate ammonia from their bodies by direct excretion. Ammonia even at dilute concentrations is highly toxic to aquatic animals, and for this reason it is [[Directive 67/548/EEC|classified]] as ''dangerous for the environment''. Ammonium compounds should never be allowed to come in contact with bases (unless in an intended and contained reaction), as dangerous quantities of ammonia gas could be released.

=== Household use ===
Solutions of ammonia (5&ndash;10% by weight) are used as household cleaners, particularly for glass. These solutions are irritating to the eyes and [[mucous membrane]]s (respiratory and digestive tracts), and to a lesser extent the skin.  Caution should be used that the chemical is never mixed into any liquid containing bleach, or a poisonous gas may result.  Mixing with [[chlorine]]-containing products or strong oxidants, for example household [[bleach]] can lead to hazardous compounds such as [[chloramine]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal | last =Rizk-Ouaini | first =Rosette | author-link = | last2 =Ferriol, Michel; Gazet, Josette; Saugier-Cohen Adad, Marie Therese   | first2 =   | author2-link =   | title = Oxidation reaction of ammonia with sodium hypochlorite.

=== Laboratory use of ammonia solutions ===
The hazards of ammonia solutions depend on the concentration: "dilute" ammonia solutions are usually 5&ndash;10% by weight (<5.62 mol/L); "concentrated" solutions are usually prepared at >25% by weight. A 25% (by weight) solution has a density of 0.907 g/cm³, and a solution which has a lower density will be more concentrated. The [[Directive 67/548/EEC|European Union classification]] of ammonia solutions is given in the table.

The ammonia vapour from concentrated ammonia solutions is severely irritating to the eyes and the respiratory tract, and these solutions should only be handled in a fume hood. Saturated ("0.880") solutions can develop a significant pressure inside a closed bottle in warm weather, and the bottle should be opened with care: this is not usually a problem for 25% ("0.900") solutions.

Ammonia solutions should not be mixed with [[halogen]]s, as toxic and/or explosive products are formed. Prolonged contact of ammonia solutions with [[silver (element)|silver]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]] or [[iodide]] salts can also lead to explosive products: such mixtures are often formed in [[qualitative analysis|qualitative chemical analysis]], and should be lightly acidified but not concentrated (<6%w/v) before disposal once the test is completed.

=== Laboratory use of anhydrous ammonia (gas or liquid) ===
<!-- EU index no. 007-001-00-5 -->
<!-- R10, 23, 34, 50; S1/2, 9, 16, 26, 36/37/39, 45, 61 -->
Anhydrous ammonia is classified as '''toxic''' ('''T''') and '''dangerous for the environment''' ('''N'''). The gas is flammable ([[autoignition temperature]]: 651 °C) and can form explosive mixtures with air (16&ndash;25%). The [[permissible exposure limit]] (PEL) in the United States is 50&nbsp;[[Parts per million|ppm]] (35&nbsp;mg/m³), while the [[IDLH]] concentration is estimated at 300&nbsp;ppm. Repeated exposure to ammonia lowers the sensitivity to the smell of the gas: normally the odour is detectable at concentrations of less than 0.5&nbsp;ppm, but desensitized individuals may not detect it even at concentrations of 100&nbsp;ppm. Anhydrous ammonia corrodes [[copper (element)|copper]]- and [[zinc (element)|zinc]]-containing [[alloy]]s, and so [[brass]] fittings should not be used for handling the gas. Liquid ammonia can also attack [[rubber]] and certain plastics.

Ammonia reacts violently with the halogens. [[Nitrogen triiodide]], a [[primary explosive|primary]] [[high explosive]], is formed when ammonia comes in contact with [[iodine]]. It causes the explosive [[polymerization]] of [[ethylene oxide]]. It also forms explosive [[fulminating]] compounds with compounds of [[gold (element)|gold]], [[silver]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], [[germanium]] or [[tellurium]], and with [[stibine]]. Violent reactions have also been reported with [[acetaldehyde]], [[hypochlorite]] solutions, [[potassium ferricyanide]] and [[peroxide]]s.

==Safety==
The U. S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)]] has set a 15-minute exposure limit for gaseous ammonia of 35 ppm by volume in the environmental air and an  8-hour exposure limit of 25 ppm by volume.<ref  name=ToxFaqSheet>[http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/tfacts126.pdf Toxic FAQ Sheet for Ammonia] published by the [[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]] (ATSDR), September 2004</ref> Exposure to very high concentrations of gaseous ammonia can result in lung damage and death.<ref name=ToxFaqSheet/> Although ammonia is regulated in the United States as a non-flammable gas, it still meets the definition of a material that is toxic by inhalation and requires a hazardous safety permit when transported in quantities greater than 13,248 L (3,500 gallons).<ref>[http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/safety-security/hazmat/hm-permitting.htm#one Hazardous Materials (HM) Safety Permits] from the website of the [[United States Department of Transportation]] (DOT)</ref>
