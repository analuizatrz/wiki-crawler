This article describes the '''history of New Zealand cricket to 1890'''.

==Historical background==
The modern history of [[New Zealand]] begins in 1642 when Dutch explorer [[Abel Tasman]] landed on Van Diemenâ€™s Land ([[Tasmania]]) and in New Zealand.  Working for the [[Dutch East India Company]], he had set out from Batavia (now [[Djakarta]]) and was supposed to find and explore [[Australia]], which had been sighted by [[Willem Jansz]] in 1606, but he sailed along the wrong latitude, too far to the south, and missed it completely, finally sighting Tasmania instead.  Tasman named New Zealand as ''Staten Landt'' and sailed north along the west coast.  He thought the [[Cook Strait]] was a bight and that New Zealand was a single entity, not two islands.  He landed somewhere on South Island and was attacked by [[Maori]], who killed four of his sailors.  He returned to Batavia by way of [[Tonga]] and [[Fiji]].  In 1644, despite a further voyage by Tasman to the north coast of Australia, the Dutch East India Company could not see anything promising in his findings, either for trade or as a naval route, and decided not to fund further exploration of the area.  As a result, it was over a century before Europeans mounted any more expeditions to Australia and New Zealand, though a few ships off course did land there from time to time.

It was in 1766 that the [[Royal Society]] commissioned Captain [[James Cook]] to lead an astronomical expedition to the [[Pacific Ocean]] for the primary purpose of charting a transit of [[Venus]].  He had a second purpose which was to search for a southern continent called ''Terra Australis'', and to establish if this had a connection with the lands visited by Tasman in the 1640s. Captain Cook left England in 1768.  He sailed south and around [[Cape Horn]] to reach [[Tahiti]] in April 1769, where the astronomical survey was concluded.  He then sailed west to try and find New Zealand. He did so and, apart from a few minor errors, mapped the complete coastline.  He discovered the Cook Strait between the two main islands, which Tasman had missed.

European colonisation of New Zealand, particularly by British settlers, began in earnest after 1800. It may safely be assumed that cricket was first played there soon after the English arrived.  

Concerned about the exploitation of Maori by Europeans, the [[British Colonial Office]] appointed [[James Busby]] as British Resident to New Zealand in 1832. In 1834, Busby convened the [[United Tribes of New Zealand]] to select a flag and declare their independence, which led to the Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand. This declaration did not allay the fears of the [[Church Missionary Society]], who continued lobbying for British annexation. Increasing French interest in the region led the British to annex New Zealand by [[Royal Proclamation]] in January 1840. 

Meanwhile, in 1832, the earliest definite reference to [[cricket]] in New Zealand is in the diary of Archdeacon Williams.

====Early developments to 1863-64====
In March 1860, the first inter-provincial match was played between teams representing Wellington and Auckland.  Other games soon followed but they were all one day matches that were not first-class.

The [http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/1/1311.html inaugural first-class match in New Zealand] was [[Otago cricket team|Otago]] v [[Canterbury cricket team|Canterbury]] at the [[South Dunedin Recreation Ground]] on 27-[[29 January]] 1864.  It was arranged as a 3-day match with 4-ball overs.  Canterbury won the toss and decided to field but Otago won by 76 runs.

Despite this being the inaugural first class match in New Zealand, five of the Otago players had previous first class experience, from [[intercolonial cricket in Australia]] with [[Victoria cricket team|Victoria]]. Nevertheless, it was a debutant, 32-year-old James Fulton who passed 25 for the first time. John Mace, a former Victoria player, and MacDonald, born in Victoria, then bowled Canterbury out for 34 by the end of the first day. On the second day, Otago batted out 65.1 overs to make 74, before Mace and MacDonald struck with four and six wickets each to win the game. 

The Otago v Canterbury fixture was played annually from 1864 onwards and became part of the [[Plunket Shield]] in the 1911-12 season.

====1864-65====
The only first class match was the first to be played in [[Canterbury Province]].  It was the second [http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/1/1359.html Canterbury v Otago] game.  The match took place on 6 & [[7 February]] 1865 at Hayley Park in [[Christchurch]].  Canterbury won by 4 wickets.  Otago scored 73 & 61; Canterbury scored 80 & 55-6.

In 1864, Otago had fielded five players with first class experience in Victoria; and a sixth who was born in Victoria.  In 1865, those players were gone and the teams were more balanced.  As in 1864, Otago captain James Fulton top-scored with 22 in the first innings, but four Canterbury players (including both openers) made double-figure scores and Canterbury took a first innings lead of seven. Canterbury captain Henry Lance then had Fulton [[stumped]] for seven, and made 12 in the chase of 55 after coming in at 27 for three. Andrew Bloxham, who played his one and only first-class game, made 18 in the first innings and 10 in the second and was Canterbury's top scorer.

====1865-66====
On 13 & [[14 February]] at South Dunedin Recreation Ground, [http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/1/1414.html Otago v Canterbury].  Otago won by 2 wickets.  Canterbury scored 68 & 97; Otago scored 105 & 62-8.

Arthur Powys, recalled as captain of Canterbury after missing the 1865 fixture, chose to bat.  Otago took a first innings lead of 37 on the first day.  Augustus Tennant, playing in his final game, made 24 for Canterbury in the second innings, but a 17-run partnership between Worthington and Murison took Otago within two runs of victory and Worthington managed to get the winning runs.

====1866-67====
On 7 & [[8 February]] at Hagley Oval in Christchurch, [http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/1/1414.html Canterbury v Otago].  Otago won by an innings and 37 runs.  Canterbury scored 25 & 32; Otago scored 94.

This was the first match played at the Hagley Oval, which became a regular venue up to 1881. The Canterbury totals of 25 and 32 were record lows in New Zealand first-class cricket, while John Hope hit a new first-class best of 28 for Otago as they managed 94 in their first innings, having being asked to bat second.  Otago bowler William Downes took 10-22 in the match, while 20-year-old debutant George Young took six wickets for Canterbury.

====1867-68 to 1872-73====
The Otago v Canterbury series continued through these seasons as the only domestic first-class fixture.

====1873-74====
The number of first-class teams was expanded to five.  Otago and Canterbury continued their annual series and both played their inuagural first-class matches against [[Auckland cricket team|Auckland]].  Auckland also played against [[Wellington cricket team|Wellington]] and Wellington played the fifth debutant [[Nelson cricket team|Nelson]].

====1874-75 to 1889-90====
Auckland, Canterbury, Otago and Wellington played regularly and became established first-class teams.
