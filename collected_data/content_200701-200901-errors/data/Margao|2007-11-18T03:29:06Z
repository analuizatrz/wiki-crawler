'''Margao''' {{audio|Margaon.ogg|pronunciation}} ([[Konkani]]/[[Marathi]]: मडगांव, [[English language|English]]: Margao, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: Margão), is also called '''Madgaon'''. It is [[Goa]]'s second largest but busiest town, the commercial capital of the state, and the administrative headquarters of [[South Goa]] District and of the [[Salcete|Salcete Taluka]].

The name may be pronounced as 'Maudgao' in [[Konkani]], the local language.  Margão is the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] form, and the form Margao is also common. It is derived from ''Mathagram'' which means a place with a [[matha]].

Nestled on the banks of the [[River Sal]], Margão is amongst the oldest recorded towns in Goa. Margão is famous for the huge [[Portugal|Portuguese]] style mansions which dot its landscape. It is also one of the fastest growing cities in Goa and includes several suburbs including [[Aquem]], Fatorda, Gogol, Borda, Comba and Davorlim.

== Transport ==

The Margão Railway station is Goa's biggest and most important as it is a railway junction positioned at the intersection of the [[Konkan Railway]] and the [[South Western Railway]]. All trains passing through Goa stop here, and it is the gateway to south Goa.  Hence Margão is used more commonly as a transit stop rather than as a tourist destination, by many people who either head off down south to [[Palolem]] (38 km) or to Benaulim and Colva which are about six kilometers away.

Though the town is also known as the cultural capital of [[Goa]], a culture center ('Ravindra Bhavan') is still under construction at Fatorda. It also has Goa's only sports stadium, the  [http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/ground/58301.html Nehru Stadium] at Fatorda and hosts the test track for [http://www.konkanrailway.com/website/ehtm/sky_bus.htm Skybus], an elevated rail system which is [http://www.konkanrailway.com/website/ehtm/krcl_patent.htm patented] by the [[Konkan Railway Corporation]] (The skybus project was later scrapped due to an accident which occurred during the test drive killing two engineers and a seriously injuring a crew of two). The pillars constructed for the skybus can be seen when going by train from Margao to Bombay. 
The Konkan Railways also planned to acquire a bullet train for the purpose of passenger travel.
However this plan is still yet to be approved.

== History ==

[[Image:Goa04 market.jpg|thumb|The Old Fish Market (Before it was shifted near the kadamba bus-stand.)]]
Margão in pre-Portuguese times was one of the important settlements in Salcete and known as ''Matha Grama'' (the village of Mathas) as it was a temple town with nine Mathas in temple schools. Most of the inhabitant were [[Brahmin]]. It was then famous for its many outstanding and beautifully built temples, and long before the Portuguese came it had a university with a library. During the Portuguese conquest in 1543 Hindu temples were demolished and Catholic churches were built in their place. Almost all traces of Hindu settlements were wiped out. The first church to be built in Margão, and its replacement in 1579, were destroyed by raiders along with the seminary that had been built along side. The present church was built in 1675.

The initial settlement of Margão grew from the site of the ancient [[Damodar temple]]. The original temple was demolished and the temple [[Irrigation tank|tank]] filled up to be replaced by the Holy Spirit church and church grounds. The Hindus carried their deity [[Damodar]] (a form of Lord [[Krishna]]) across the [[Zuari]] Agranashini river to the Hindu territories held by the Sonde ''Rayas''. While the western side of the Church developed as a market place the settlement grew on the eastern side, that is, the Borda region. The settlement grew with the church at its core and extended outwards.

The Holy Spirit main square is defined on one side by the church with its baroque architecture and the parochial house, and on the other side by the palatial mansions of affluent elite Catholics, positioned in a row. The ''Associação das Communidades'' building and the school being the odd exceptions. They add to its character and sense of scale. They have a maximum height of two stories, and ''balcões'' (singular: ''balcão'') and ''varandas'' facing the square. Parallel to the church square is the commercial street (old market). There is also a landscaped area next to the church called ''Praça da Alegria'' (meaning: joy square).

Margão's importance as an administrative and commercial area grew with the increasing dependence of the surrounding towns and villages; leading to the administrative centre with the town hall at its centre being built in the south. The commercial market became attached to it and was hence called ''maud-gao'' or the market town of Goa, and since then the city has grown towards the east.

In 1961, as a result of [[Operation Vijay (1961)|Operation Vijay]], Goa was incorporated as part of the Indian Union, and Margao was declared as the administrative centre of the district of South Goa.
