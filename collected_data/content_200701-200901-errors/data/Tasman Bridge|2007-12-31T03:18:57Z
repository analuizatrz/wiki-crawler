The '''Tasman Bridge''' is a five-lane [[bridge]] crossing the [[Derwent River, Tasmania|Derwent River]], near the [[Central business district|CBD]] of [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]].
The bridge has a total length (including approaches) of 1,395 meters (4,576&nbsp;ft) &ndash; longer than the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]].  It provides the main traffic route from the CBD (on the western shore) to the eastern shore - particularly [[Hobart International Airport]] and [[Bellerive Oval]]. It has a [[pedestrian]] foot way on each side, but no dedicated lane for [[bicycle]]s.  However, steps to the pedestrian foot way have recently been replaced with on-ramps.

==History==
In the 1950's with the development of the Eastern shore (the old [[Hobart Bridge]] faced increasing difficulty in managing the larger volumes of [[traffic]], and the bridge itself - constantly raising the lift span for shipping) it was decided to build a larger bridge. The total cost of the new bridge in conjunction with approach ramps and Lindisfarne interchange was in the area of 7,000,000.00 pounds. Construction commenced in [[May]], [[1960]] and the bridge was first opened to traffic (2 lanes only) on [[August 18]], [[1964]]. The bridge was completed with all four lanes operational on [[December 23]] [[1964]]. During peak construction a labor force of over 400 men was employed on site.<ref>{{cite web | year = 2004 | url = http://www.parliament.tas.gov.au/history/tbstats.htm | title = Tasman Bridge Statistics | publisher = Tasmanian Government | accessdate = 2007-03-04}}</ref>

==Disaster==
On Sunday [[January 5]], [[1975]], at 9:27 p.m. Australian Eastern Summer Time, the Tasman Bridge was struck by the bulk ore carrier ''[[Lake Illawarra (ship)|Lake Illawarra]]'', bound for the Electrolytic Zinc Company with a cargo of 10,000 tons of zinc concentrate (AusStats, 2002). It caused two pylons and three sections of concrete decking, totaling 127 meters (417&nbsp;ft), to fall from the bridge and sink the ship. Seven of the ship's crewmen were killed, and five motorists died when four cars drove over the collapsed sections before the traffic was stopped. A major press shot showed a 3,000km old [[Holden Monaro]] GTS, which was owned by Frank and Sylvia Maley, along with an older EK Holden station wagon, perched balancing on the ledge.

The depth of the river at this point (35 metres (115&nbsp;ft)) is such that the wreck of ''Lake Illawarra'' lies on the bottom, with concrete slab on top of it, without presenting a navigation hazard to smaller vessels.

The breakage of an important arterial link isolated the residents in Hobart’s eastern suburbs – the relatively short drive across the Tasman Bridge to the city suddenly became a 50 kilometre (31&nbsp;mi) journey via the estuary's next bridge at [[Bridgewater, Tasmania|Bridgewater]]. The only other vehicular crossing within Hobart after the bridge collapsed was the Risdon Punt, a [[cable ferry]] which crossed the river from East Risdon and Risdon, some five kilometers upstream from the bridge. However, it was totally inadequate, carrying only eight cars on each crossing, and although ferries provided a service across the Derwent River, it was not until December 1975 that a single lane [[Bailey bridge]] was opened to traffic, thereby restoring some connectivity.

The separation of Hobart saw an immediate surge in the small and limited ferry service then operating across the river. In a primary position to provide a service were the two ships of [[Bob Clifford|Robert Clifford]], a Tasmanian mariner. He had introduced the locally-built ferries ''Matthew Brady'' and ''James McCabe'' to the river crossing, from the Central Business District of Hobart to the eastern shore, shortly before the collision. These two ships were soon joined by the ''Cartela'', a wooden vessel of 1912 vintage, and other ships pressed into service by the Tasmanian Government, to ferry thousands of commuters across the river. 

Following successful rebuilding of the Bridge, Clifford's organisation saw the ferry traffic fade quickly, but by then he had diversified into further building of ships. His company, [[Incat]], has successfully exported vessels to China, Europe, and built vessels for the [[United States Navy]]. The company is one of the largest employers in Tasmania.

Additionally, in [[2007]], a crane toppled whilst carrying out works on the bridge, and precariously hung for a number of hours off the side of the barriers, on [[June 20]].

==Reconstruction==
Reconstruction of the Tasman Bridge commenced in October [[1975]]. An important factor of the reconstruction is the improved safety measures.  Some examples:
*Large vessels passing beneath the bridge must now do so slightly to the west of the original main navigation span.
*Personnel controlling ships (or [[harbor pilot]]s) must be trained and then cleared for using the special [[laser]] [[lighthouse]] that indicates by colors whether the ship must be steered left or right to regain the centre line.[[Image:Hobart Tasman.JPG|300px|thumb|right|(Top) Lights that manage the Bridge's Lanes]]
*All road traffic is now halted whilst large vessels transit beneath the bridge. 
On top of these new safety measures implemented, the bridge was further upgraded to hold a fifth lane. This upgrade included the construction of lane management systems which would enable the new middle lane to function as a [[Reversible lane]]. The system is comprised of a traffic light system and sign above each lane, pictured right. The signs, in conjunction with the traffic light system, employ a [[pulley]] system to periodically pull the signs over their appropriate lanes.

The middle lane points toward the city side (or western shore) during a.m. peak hours and points back toward the eastern shore during p.m. peak hours. The lane generally points toward the eastern shore during non-peak hours.


The bridge officially reopened on [[October 8]], [[1977]].
