'''''The Most Excellent and Lamentable Tragedie of Romeo and Juliet''''' is a world-renowned [[tragedy]] by [[William Shakespeare]] concerning two young "[[Star-crossed|star-cross'd lovers]]" and the role played by their tragic [[suicide]]s in ending a long-running family feud. It is one of the most famous of Shakespeare's plays, one of his earliest theatrical triumphs, and is thought to be the most [[archetype|archetypal]] love story of the [[Renaissance]] and indeed the history of Western culture.

''Romeo and Juliet'' is a dramatization of [[Arthur Brooke]]'s narrative poem ''[[The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet]]'' (1562). Shakespeare followed Brooke's poem closely<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Sources of Romeo and Juliet|author=Arthur J. Roberts|journal=Modern Language Notes|volume=17|issue=2|year=Feb 1902|pages=41-44}}</ref> but enriched its texture by adding extra detail to both major and minor characters, in particular the Nurse and [[Mercutio]]. Shakespeare also knew ''"The goodly History of the true and constant love of Rhomeo and Julietta"'', a prose retelling of the story by [[William Painter]].<ref>N. H. Keeble "York Notes on Romeo and Juliet" (Longman, 1980) p.18</ref>

Brooke's poem was not original either, being a translation and adaptation of [[Giuletta e Romeo]], by [[Matteo Bandello]], included in his ''Novelle'' of 1554.  This was in turn an adaptation of [[Luigi da Porto]]'s [[Giulietta e Romeo]], included in his [[Istoria novellamente ritrovata di due Nobili Amanti]] (c. 1530).<ref>Moore, Olin. "Bandello and Clizia." ''Modern Language Notes'' 52 (1937): 38-44.</ref> This is the version that gave the story much of its modern form, including the names of the lovers, the rival families of Montecchi and Capuleti, and the location in [[Verona]], in the [[Veneto]]. However, the earliest-known version of the tale is the 1476 story of Mariotto and Gianozza of [[Siena]] by [[Masuccio Salernitano]], in [[Il Novellino]] (Novella XXXIII).<ref>Hosley, Richard, editor. ''Romeo and Juliet''. New Haven: Yale University Press, 168.</ref>

Bandello's story was the most famous and was translated into French (and into English by Brooke). It was also adapted by Italian theatrical troupes, some of whom performed in London at the time that Shakespeare was writing his plays.  Although nothing is known of the repertory of these itinerant troupes, it is possible that they performed a version of the story.<ref>[[Madeline Doran]], ''Endeavors of Art''. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1954: 132.</ref> 

This story of ill-fated lovers had obvious parallels with similar tales told throughout history, including those of [[Hero and Leander]], [[Pyramus and Thisbe]], [[Floris and Blanchefleur]], [[Troilus and Cressida]], [[Antony and Cleopatra]], [[Layla and Majnun]], [[Tristan and Iseult]], [[Chosroes and Shirin|Shirin and Farhad]] and [[Hagbard and Signy]].  Shakespeare was familiar with these stories, some of which were included in his other plays.  The tale of Pyramus and Thisbe appears in comic mode in [[A Midsummer Night's Dream]], while the Trojan War lovers, Troilus and Cressida, were given a history play of their own.

==Date and text== 
[[Image:Romeo and juliet title page.jpg |thumb|right|Title page of the Second Quarto of ''Romeo and Juliet'' (published 1599)]]
Shakespeare's ''Romeo and Juliet'' was published in two distinct [[book size|quarto]] editions prior to the publication of the [[First Folio]] of 1623.  These are referred to as [[First quarto|Q1]] and [[Second quarto|Q2]]. Q2's title page called the play '"The Most Excellent and Lamentable Tragedie of Romeo and Juliet".

Q1, the first printed edition, appeared in 1597, printed by John Danter.  Because its text contains numerous differences from the later editions, it is labelled a '[[bad quarto]]': the twentieth century editor T. J .B. Spencer described it as "a detestable text, probably a reconstruction of the play from the imperfect memories of one or two of the actors."<ref>T. J. B Spencer (ed.) The New Penguin Shakespeare "Romeo and Juliet" (Penguin, London, 1967) "An account of the Text" p.284</ref>

The superior [[Second quarto|Q2]] followed in [[1599]], published by Cuthbert Burby and printed by Thomas Creede. It is a much more complete and reliable text, and was reprinted in 1609 (Q3), 1622 (Q4) and 1637 (Q5).<ref>T. J. B Spencer (ed.) The New Penguin Shakespeare "Romeo and Juliet" (Penguin, London, 1967) "An account of the Text" p.286</ref> Its title page describes it as "Newly corrected, augmented and amended". Scholars believe that this text was based on Shakespeare's pre-performance draft, since there are textual oddities such as variable tags for characters and "false starts" for speeches that were presumably struck through by the author but erroneously preserved by the typesetter.<ref>T. J. B Spencer (ed.) The New Penguin Shakespeare "Romeo and Juliet" (Penguin, London, 1967) "An account of the Text" p.280</ref> Q2 contains 800 lines missing from [[first quarto|Q1]]. Q2 also has an interestingly defective stage direction: it reads "Enter [[William Kempe|Will Kempe]]" instead of "Enter Peter" in IV,v,102.

The First Folio text of 1623 seems to be based primarily on Q3, with some clarifications and corrections possibly coming from a theatrical promptbook.<ref>T. J. B Spencer (ed.) The New Penguin Shakespeare "Romeo and Juliet" (Penguin, London, 1967) "An account of the Text" p.286</ref>

The greater part of ''Romeo and Juliet'' is written in [[iambic pentameter]].  However, the play is also notable for its copious use of [[rhyme]]d verse, notably in the [[sonnet]] contained in Romeo and Juliet's dialogue in the scene where they first meet (Act I, Scene v, Lines 95-108).

==Performance history==
[[Image:Wherefore_Art_Thou_Romeo_-_William_Hatherell.jpg|thumb|left|''O Romeo, Romeo, Wherefore Art Thou Romeo?'' by [[William Hatherell]]]]''Romeo and Juliet'' was a popular play in Shakespeare's lifetime. Gary Taylor measures it as the sixth most popular of Shakespeare's plays, in the period after the death of [[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe]] and [[Thomas Kyd|Kyd]] but before the ascendancy of [[Ben Jonson|Jonson]] during which Shakespeare was London's dominant playwright.<ref>Gary Taylor "Shakespeare Plays on Renaissance Stages" in [[Stanley Wells]] and Sarah Stanton (eds.) "The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare on Stage" (Cambridge University Press, 2002) p.18. The five more popular plays, in descending order, are [[Henry VI, Part 1]], [[Richard III (play)|Richard III]], [[Pericles, Prince of Tyre|Pericles]], [[Hamlet]] and [[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]</ref>

After the theatres re-opened in the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], Sir [[William Davenant]] staged a 1662 production in which [[Henry Harris]] played Romeo, [[Thomas Betterton]] was Mercutio, and Betterton's wife [[Mary Saunderson]] played Juliet.<ref>Van Lennep, William, editor. ''The London Stage, 1660-1800''. Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1965: 1:48.</ref> [[Thomas Otway]]'s adaptation ''The History and Fall of Caius Marius'', one of the more extreme of the Restoration versions of Shakespeare, debuted in 1680. The scene is shifted from Renaissance Verona to ancient Rome; Romeo is Marius, Juliet is Lavinia, the feud is between patricians and plebians; Juliet/Lavina wakes from her potion before Romeo/Marius dies. Otway's version was a hit, and was acted for the next seventy years. [[Theophilus Cibber]] mounted his own adaptation in 1744, followed by [[David Garrick]]'s in 1748. Both Cibber and Garrick used variations on Otway's innovation in the tomb scene.<ref>Jean I. Marsden "Shakespeare from the Restoration to Garrick" in [[Stanley Wells]] and Sarah Stanton (eds.) "The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare on Stage" (Cambridge University Press, 2002) pp.26-27</ref>

In 1750 came the so-called "Battle of the Romeos," with [[Spranger Barry]] and [[Susannah Maria Arne]] (Mrs. Theophilus Cibber) at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] versus [[David Garrick]] and [[George Anne Bellamy]] at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]].<ref>Pedicord, Harry William.

[[Henry Irving]]'s 1882 production at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]] is considered an archetype of his "pictorial" style, placing the action on elaborate sets. Irving hmself played Romeo, and [[Ellen Terry]] played Juliet.<ref>Richard W. Scooch "Pictorial Shakespeare" in [[Stanley Wells]] and Sarah Stanton (eds.) "The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare on Stage" (Cambridge University Press, 2002) pp.62-63</ref>

In one of the most notable twentieth century performances, staged by [[John Gielgud]] at the [[NoÃ«l Coward Theatre|New Theatre]] in 1935, Gielgud and [[Laurence Olivier]] played the roles of Romeo and Mercutio, exchanging roles six weeks into the run, with [[Peggy Ashcroft]] as Juliet.<ref>Robert Smallwood "Twentieth-century Performance" in [[Stanley Wells]] and Sarah Stanton (eds.) "The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare on Stage" (Cambridge University Press, 2002) p.102</ref>

Other notable twentieth century productions include [[Guthrie McClintic|Guthrie McClintic's]] [[1934]] [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] staging in which [[Katharine Cornell]] had a triumph as Juliet opposite [[Basil Rathbone]] as Romeo and [[Edith Evans]] (who also played the role in the [[John Gielgud|Gielgud]] production) as the Nurse. Cornell later revived the production with [[Maurice Evans (actor)|Maurice Evans]] as Romeo and [[Ralph Richardson]] as Mercutio, both making their [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debuts. [[Franco Zeffirelli]] mounted a legendary staging for the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] in 1962 with [[John Stride]] and [[Judi Dench]] that served as the basis for his [[Romeo and Juliet (1968 film)|1968 film]].

==Synopsis==
{{quote|"Two Households, both alike in dignity ..."|Chorus}}
[[Image:Francesco Hayez 053.jpg|thumb|right|''Romeo and Juliet'' by [[Francesco Hayez]]]]
<!-- The play begins with a 14-line [[prologue]] by a Chorus in the form of a [[Shakespearean sonnet]]. It describes to the audience two noble families of [[Verona]] that have [[feud]]ed for generations, explaining that
two lovers from these families will take their lives in a tragic [[suicide]] that will "bury their parents' strife". --><!-- This doesn't really seem to be part of the plot, but could be placed elsewhere in the article. -->

The play begins with a street-battle between two families, the Montagues and the Capulets.  The Prince of [[Verona]], [[Prince Escalus|Escalus]], intervenes with his men and declares that the heads of the two families will be held personally accountable for any further breach of the peace.

Later, [[Count Paris]], a young nobleman, talks to Lord Capulet about marrying his thirteen-year-old daughter, [[Juliet Capulet|Juliet]]. Capulet demurs, citing the girl's tender age, and invites him to attract the attention of Juliet during a [[Masquerade ball|ball]] that the family is to hold that night. Meanwhile, Juliet's mother tries to persuade her daughter to accept Paris' wooing during their coming ball. Juliet states that she will make an effort to love him, but will not go after what is not there. In this scene Juliet's nurse is introduced as a talkative and humourous character who has raised Juliet from infancy.

Meantime, [[Benvolio]] queries his cousin [[Romeo Montague|Romeo]], Lord Montague's son, to find out the source of his melancholy. He discovers that it stems from an unrequited love for a girl named [[Rosaline]]. Upon the insistence of Benvolio and another friend, [[Mercutio]], Romeo decides to attend the masquerade at the Capulet house, in hope of meeting Rosaline.

Alongside his masked friends, Romeo attends the ball as planned, but instead falls for Juliet, and she with him. After discovering that the lovers are of feuding blood, Romeo and Juliet meet on Juliet's balcony. Despite their families' feud, the two declare their love for each other and their intent to marry. With the help of the [[Franciscan]] [[Friar Lawrence]], who hopes to reconcile the two families through their children's union, the two are [[marriage|married]] secretly the next day.

All seems well until [[Tybalt]], Juliet's hot-blooded [[cousin]], challenges Romeo to a [[duel]] for appearing in the Capulets' ball disguised. Though no one is aware of the marriage yet, Romeo refuses to fight Tybalt since they are now kinsmen.  Mercutio is incensed by Tybalt's insolence, and accepts on Romeo's behalf. In the ensuing duel, Mercutio is fatally wounded when Romeo tries to intervene. Romeo, angered by his friend's death, pursues and slays Tybalt, then flees.

Despite his promise to call for the head of the wrong-doers, the Prince merely [[exile]]s Romeo from Verona, reasoning that Tybalt first killed Mercutio, and Romeo merely carried out a just punishment to Tybalt, although without legal authority. Meanwhile, the Capulets engage their unwilling daughter to marry Paris in three days' time, threatening to disown her if she does not. The Nurse, once Juliet's confidante, now tells her she should discard the exiled Romeo and comply. Juliet desperately visits Friar Lawrence for help. He offers her a [[drug]] which will put her into a death-like coma for forty-two hours. She is to take it, and, when discovered apparently dead, she will be laid in the family [[crypt]]. While in her sleep, the Friar will send a messenger to inform Romeo, so that she can rejoin him when she awakes.
[[Image:Johann Heinrich FÃ¼ssli 060.jpg|left|thumb|Romeo at Juliet's Deathbed, by [[Johann Heinrich FÃ¼ssli]]]]
The messenger, however, does not reach Romeo. Romeo instead learns of Juliet's "death" from his servant Balthasar. Grief-stricken, he buys strong [[poison]] from an [[apothecary]], returns to Verona in secret, and visits the Capulets' crypt. He encounters Paris, who has come to mourn Juliet privately. Paris confronts Romeo, believing him to be a vandal, and in the ensuing battle, Romeo kills Paris. Romeo says his final words to the comatose Juliet and drinks the poison in [[suicide]]. Juliet then awakes. Friar Lawrence arrives and, aware of the cause of the tragedy, begs Juliet to leave, but she refuses. At the side of Romeo's dead body, she stabs herself with her lover's dagger.

The feuding families and the Prince meet at the tomb to find three of their families' dead. In explanation, Friar Lawrence recounts the story of the two lovers. Montague reveals that his wife has died of grief after hearing of her son's exile. The families are reconciled by their children's deaths and agree to end their violent feud.  The play ends with the Prince's brief [[elegy]] for the lovers. The Capulets erect a statue of Romeo and the Montagues will erect one of Juliet. The Prince makes his parting words: "For never was a story of more woe Than this of Juliet and her Romeo."

===Plays===
[[Image:Romeo and Juliet.jpg|thumb|right|Romeo and Juliet statue in [[Central Park]] in [[New York City]].]]
Adaptations of Romeo and Juliet have used modern settings. For instance, a version of the play which had Romeo as a [[Palestinian]] and Juliet as a [[Jew]] in [[Israel]] and the [[Palestinian territories]] were made, which criticizes the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]].<ref>Pape, Ilan. "Post-Zionist Critique on Israel and the Palestinians Part III: Popular Culture." ''Journal of Palestine Studies'' 26 (1997): 69.</ref> Similarly, versions have also been devised dealing with [[apartheid]] in [[South Africa]], in which Romeo is black and Juliet is white.<ref>Quince, Rohan.

A Native American version called ''Kino and Teresa'' was first produced in 2005 by Native Voices at the Autry in Los Angeles.  Written by James Lujan, the historical play was set in 17th Century Santa Fe, seventeen years after the Pueblo Revolt of 1680 and revolved around the conflict between the Pueblo Indians and Spanish colonists.<ref>{{cite web|last=Klugman|first=Deborah|url=http://www.laweekly.com/index.php?option=com_lsd&task=film&Itemid=109&id=81675|title=Kino and Teresa review|publisher=[[LA Weekly]]|accessdate=2007-02-17}}</ref>

The play ''[[Shakespeare's R&J]]'', adapted by [[Joe Calarco]], is about a group of [[Catholicism|Catholic]] school boys who steal a copy of ''Romeo and Juliet'' because all of Shakespeare's plays have been banned from their school, due to their lustful content. The boys then act out the play in a basement, and the power of the love story starts to take a hold of the boys playing Romeo and Juliet. The "forbidden kiss" then takes on a new meaning for them.<ref>[http://www.outsmartmagazine.com/issue/i02-00/shakespeare.html Walton Sieber, Ann. "Forbidden Love: Our Favorite Kind," ''Outsmart Magazine''], accessed June 6, 2006.</ref>

===Opera===
The story was converted into the [[opera]] ''[[RomÃ©o et Juliette]]'' by [[Charles Gounod]] in 1867 with a [[libretto]] written by [[Jules Barbier]] and [[Michel CarrÃ©]].

The ''Romeo and Juliet'' story was also the subject of [[Vincenzo Bellini]]'s opera ''[[I Capuleti e i Montecchi]]'', although Bellini and his librettist, [[Felice Romani]], worked from Italian sources, and these were only distantly related to Shakespeare's work.

In 2004 American composer [[Lee Hoiby]] also adapted ''Romeo and Juliet'' to write an opera of the same name.

"[[Butterfly Lovers]]", a [[Chinese Opera]], is commonly known as the Chinese version of Romeo and Juliet.

===Ballet===
Several [[ballet]] adaptations of the story have been made, the first written in the 18th century.  The best known feature music by [[Sergei Prokofiev]], and a variety of choreographers have used this music.  The first version featuring Prokofiev's music was performed in [[1938]].  See: [[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)]]

===Musical===
''Romeo and Juliet'' is the basis for many famous musicals, most notably the hugely successful ''[[West Side Story]]''
;''[[Romeo and Juliet (Tchaikovsky)|Romeo and Juliet Fantasy Overture]]''
:The "[[Romeo and Juliet (Tchaikovsky)|Romeo and Juliet Fantasy Overture]]" (1869, revised 1870, 1880), by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Peter Tchaikovsky]], contains one of the world's most famous melodies. The tremendously famous love theme in the middle of this long symphonic poem has been used countless times in commercials and movies.
;''[[West Side Story]]''
:In 1957, the [[Musical theater|musical]] ''[[West Side Story]]'' debuted on Broadway, with music by [[Leonard Bernstein]] and lyrics by [[Stephen Sondheim]]. This version of "Romeo and Juliet" updated the setting to mid-[[20th century]] [[New York City]] and the warring families to ethnic gangs. ''West Side Story'' opened on the West End in London in 1958 and then was released as a film in 1961. 
;''William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet''
:In 1999, [[Terrence Mann]]'s rock musical ''William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet'', co-written with Jerome Korman, premiered at the Ordway Theatre in St. Paul, Minnesota. It was not a critical success.
;''[[RomÃ©o et Juliette, de la Haine Ã  l'Amour]]''
:''[[RomÃ©o et Juliette, de la Haine Ã  l'Amour]]'', a musical by [[GÃ©rard Presgurvic]], premiered on January 19, 2001 in the Palais de CongrÃ¨s in Paris, France. By 2005, it had already attracted some six million people.
;''[[Once on This Island]]''
:"[[Once on This Island]]" is another musical adaptation that takes on the Romeo and Juliet theme.  These star crossed lovers, Ti Moune and Daniel, were fated to love one another even with the pressures of their class and ethnic backgrounds upon them. However, it was only through death that they could be together.

====Film adaptations====
The film ''[[West Side Story (film)|West Side Story]]'' was released in 1961 following the success of the musical on stage in New York and London. It was set in a 1960s [[New York City]] gang culture and was loosely based on the story of Romeo and Juliet, with the Montagues becoming the Jets and the Capulets becoming the Sharks. This film also resulted in another adaptation, ''[[West Bank Story]]'', a musical comedy which was set, unsurprisingly, in the contemporary West Bank. West Bank Story won the 2006 best Live Action Short at the Academy Awards (Oscars).<ref>[http://www.westbankstory.com/]</ref>

The film ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'' is a fictional account of how Shakespeare writes the play against the clock inspired by his love for a noble woman. The movie also describes the start of ''[[Twelfth Night]],'' inspired by the same woman's ultimate fate. The film won Best Picture at the [[1999 Academy Awards]]. Another film, [[Love Is All There Is]], staring Angelina Jolie and Lannie Kazan, is a comedic take on the tragic story. It takes place in the Bronx, New York and involves two Italian immigrant families who own opposing restaurants. The two families hate each other and have tried to run each other out of business for years. When their children secretly fall in love, the families are forced to deal with it. Instead of the tragic Shakespearean ending, the movie makes the story a bit more light-hearted.

===Television===
Many television adaptations have also been made. The Canadian-produced animated television special ''[[Romie-0 and Julie-8]]'' (1979) is a [[science fiction]] adaptation of the play, recasting the lead characters as robots. The 2005 television movie "[[Pizza My Heart]]" is also based on ''Romeo and Juliet''. This story takes place in Verona, New Jersey and is centered around the lives of two feuding pizzeria owners, the Prestolanis and the Montebellos. In ''[[Romeo and Juliet in Sarajevo]]'' the characters (Romeo and Juliet and Admira and BoÅ¡ko) simply want to live their lives and be allowed to love one another, yet are tragically prevented from doing so, instead succumbing to an untimely death. Disney's ''[[High School Musical]]'' began as a made-for-tv Disney movie and was subsequently turned into a live stage musical and touring concert. Said executive producer Bill Borden, "Our story line is maybe not the most original or creative, but it's Shakespearean," said Borden, who described the plot as a modern version of Romeo and Juliet. "We took from the best."<ref>[http://www.azcentral.com/ent/tv/articles/0302highschool.html]</ref> In the show, the two young love interests, Troy and Gabriella, are from rival cliques, not rival gangs.<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=404621&in_page_id=1773]</ref>

Even anime has managed to produce its own adaptations. ''[[Sea Prince and the Fire Child]]'' (1981), an anime movie by [[Sanrio]] (based on a story by Sanrio founder, [[Shintaro Tsuji]]), was inspired by Romeo & Juliet (the main characters are from different races, sea spirits and fire spirits). The [[Japan]]ese animation studio [[Gonzo (studio)|Gonzo]]  adapted ''Romeo and Juliet'' into an [[anime]] television series entitled ''[[Romeo x Juliet]]''. Set in a dystopian world on a supernatural, aerial city known as Neo Verona, the series premiered April 2007.
