'''''Carnivàle''''', pronounced /{{IPA|kɑɹ.nɪ'væl}}/ ("car-nih-VAL"),<ref>Per DVD audio commantaries by producers</ref> is an [[United States|American]] dramatic [[television series]] produced by [[Home Box Office|HBO]] and ran for two seasons between 2003 and 2005. The show was created by [[Daniel Knauf]], and starred [[Nick Stahl]] and [[Clancy Brown]]. It won 5 Emmys in 2004.

The series is a period drama set in the [[United States]] during the [[Great Depression]] and follows the lives of two very different groups of people. It has an overarching story about the battle between [[good]] and [[evil]] as well as the struggle between [[free will]] and [[destiny]], and mixes [[Christianity|Christian]] theology with aspects of [[gnosticism]] and [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] lore, particularly that of the [[Knights Templar]].

==Conception==

''Carnivàle'' creator [[Daniel Knauf]] conceived the initial script for the ''Carnivàle'' pilot in 1991, thirteen years before the shooting of the series began.<ref name=chat_milfay>{{cite web |url=http://www.savecarnivale.org/html/carniecast_071705.htm |title=Highlights from the Dan Knauf Chat - Episode 1 - Milfay |date=[[July 17]], [[2005]] |publisher=savecarnivale.org |accessdate=2007-07-28}}</ref><ref name=variety_creation>{{cite web |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117906608.html?categoryid=1734&cs=1 |title=''Carnivale'' - Where mysticism's often meted out in meticulously slow fashion |date=[[June 16]], [[2004]] |publisher=variety.com |accessdate=2007-07-28}}</ref> During this time, Knauf worked sporadically in [[Hollywood]] but mainly earned his living with jobs such as in the insurance business, so his experience in the film and television business was not very developed. The ''Carnivàle'' script, originally intended to be a feature script, was one of his first scripts.<ref name=variety_creation /> Despite his other involvements, Knauf continued to tweak the script in the following years and plotted the broad strokes of the story from the beginning so that he knew where ''Carnivàle'' would head, up to the last scene of the show. A certain amount of flexibility was always considered.<ref name=chat_milfay /><ref name=yahoo_msg11817>[http://tv.groups.yahoo.com/group/CarnivaleHBO/message/11817 Daniel Knauf at Yahoo Carnivale HBO] (registration required) ([[February 21]], [[2005]]).

In 2001, Daniel Knauf decided to part from the feature business and forwarded the ''Carnivàle'' script as a TV script to [[Howard Klein]] via a mutal friend, [[Scott Winant]].<ref name=variety_creation /><ref name=dvd_museum>''The Museum of Television & Radio's William S. Paley Television Festival CARNIVALE'' (March 16, 2004). Part of the ''Carnivàle'' Season 2 DVD Special Features.</ref> Klein then brought it to the attention of [[HBO]], who were receptive immediately.<ref name=dvd_museum /> The pilot episode was shot over a period of twenty-one days. Once the show got greenlit, additional material, mainly on Brother Justin's side, was shot.<ref name=chat_milfay />

Knauf had originally designed Brother Justin as a preacher far along in his career as well as a recurring instead of a regular character. But after seeing the prelimary pilot, Knauf and his group of producers realized that there was nowhere to go with him in a television series. So they decided to make Brother Justin an ordinary Methodist minister in a little town, setting him back in time for about a year or two. This opened new possibilities, and the character of Iris was created as a supporting character around him.<ref name carni_iw_jan04>{{cite web |url=http://carnivaleinterviews.blogspot.com/2004_01_01_archive.html |title=Interview with Daniel Knauf - Part 1 |date=[[January 12]], [[2004]] |publisher=Beth Blighton at carnivaleinterviews.blogspot.com |accessdate=2007-07-29}}</ref>

Little was changed on Ben Hawkins' side. The Dreifuss family was only added after a ''Carnivàle'' consultant told the producers about his research of families managing cooch shows, which fascinated them.<ref name carni_iw_jan04 />

==Format==

The ''Carnivàle'' story was originally intended to take place over three "cycles," each lasting two seasons, for a total of six seasons.<ref name=hbo_msg683555>[http://boards.hbo.com/thread.jspa?threadID=300000617&messageID=300683555#300683555 Daniel Knauf (fboffo) at HBO forums] ([[April 17]], [[2005]]). Retrieved on [[July 28]], [[2007]].</ref> This plan was abruptly changed when HBO cancelled the show after only two seasons, although the first two seasons of Carnivale still make up one finished "book."

Each season consists of thirteen episodes, describing the events in the lives of two characters who have yet to meet. Although almost each episode has a distiniguished story that may qualify as a separate entity, all episodes are parts of an overarching [[Good and evil|good-versus-evil]] story that only culminates and resolves very late in Season 2. Show creator [[Daniel Knauf]] stated that ''Carnivàle'' was written to be open to interpretation, including the interpretation of the writer.<ref name=yahoo_msg11232>[http://tv.groups.yahoo.com/group/CarnivaleHBO/message/11232 Daniel Knauf at Yahoo Carnivale HBO] (registration required) ([[February 11]], [[2005]]).

==Cancellation and future==
{{seealso|Fictional universe of Carnivàle#Open questions}}

''Carnivàle'' drew 5.3 million viewers for its premiere and finished the first season with 3.5 million viewers.<ref name=variety_creation /> During the second season, the ratings slowly rose toward the end, but the show became increasingly expensive to produce.<ref name=zap2it /> [[HBO]] however traditionally carries many of its shows through to an end, so the future of ''Carnivàle'' beyond Season 2 was not clear. Since HBO makes their commitments only for one year at a time, a new Season 3 would have meant to open up a new two-season book in Daniel Knauf's six-year plan, including introducing new storylines for the current characters as well as for new characters, and further clarifying and elaborating on the show's mythology.<ref name=yahoo_msg17804>[http://tv.groups.yahoo.com/group/CarnivaleHBO/message/17804 Daniel Knauf at Yahoo Carnivale HBO] (registration required) ([[April 1]], [[2005]]).

Although many fans had assumed that the show would be renewed, it was leaked in early May 2005 that the series would not be returning for a third season.<ref name=yahoo_msg19860>[http://tv.groups.yahoo.com/group/CarnivaleHBO/message/19860 Yahoo Carnivale HBO] (registration required) ([[May 7]], [[2005]]). Mirrored at [http://forums.dvdfile.com/showthread.php?t=53930 forums.dvdfile.com]. Retrieved on [[July 28]], [[2007]].</ref> HBO confirmed that the show had been cancelled on May 11, 2005.<ref name=variety_cancellation /> HBO's president [[Chris Albrecht]] stated that HBO would have considered otherwise if the producers had been willing to lower the price of an episode to US$2 million. But the costs for the size of the cast, the all-on location shooting and the number of episodes per season were too enormous for them.<ref name=zap2it />

The cancellation left several plotlines unfinished and outraged many viewers. Some of them organized petitions and mailing drives to HBO in an effort to get the show renewed. This generated more than 50,000 emails to the network in a single weekend.<ref name=zap2it>{{cite web |url=http://tv.zap2it.com/tveditorial/tve_main/1,1002,271%7C96426%7C1%7C,00.html |title='Carnivale' Fans Besiege HBO with E-mails |date=[[July 18]], [[2005]] |publisher=zap2it.com |accessdate=2007-07-25}}</ref> Show creator Daniel Knauf told fans that such moves would likely not prove very successful, and that HBO would not reconsider their cancellation announcement anytime soon.<ref name=chat_milfay /> He doubted that HBO would want to sell the show or allow it to air on a competing network, and since HBO owns the characters as well as the plot, Knauf would not be allowed not spin off his story into a new form or medium without HBO's permission.<ref name=yahoo_msg18916>[http://tv.groups.yahoo.com/group/CarnivaleHBO/message/18916 Daniel Knauf at Yahoo Carnivale HBO] (registration required) ([[April 17]], [[2005]]).

Daniel Knauf predicted though that, given a strong enough fan base, HBO's own plans might change in the future, possibly switching ''Carnivàle'' to another medium.<ref name=chat_milfay /> At the same time, Knauf made it explicitly clear that tying up loose ends via a three-hour movie was not an option for him, and that he would refuse to participate if one was made. Knauf was not willing to sacrifice his story material that was enough to have ''Carnivàle'' go for four more seasons, and he would rather "leave Carnivale unfinished than finished poorly."<ref name=yahoo_msg18916 /><ref>Canceled (for now) - Die-hards fight to save TV faves.

Knauf would not release a quick run-down of intended future plots, and explained his reasons with the needed collaboration with other writers, the directors, and the actors. He however answered a few basic details about the immediate fate of major characters, who were left hanging after Season 2's cliffhanger,<ref name=yahoo_msg20373>[http://tv.groups.yahoo.com/group/CarnivaleHBO/message/20373 Daniel Knauf at Yahoo Carnivale HBO] (registration required) ([[May 12]], [[2005]]).

Retrieved on [[July 28]], [[2007]].</ref> and provided in-depth information regarding the underlying fictional laws of nature that the writers had not been able to fully explore in the first two seasons.

As of July 2007, no news have come up about HBO reviving ''Carnivàle'' except for a February 2006 mediavillage.com article; it stated that [[HBO]] may be considering developing a movie or miniseries that would wrap up many of these plot lines to be telecast in 2007. A resurrection of the franchise as an ongoing series was also deemed possible for 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mediavillage.com/jmentr/2006/02/09/jmer-02-09-06/ |title=Fans May See More of ''Arrested Development'' and ''Carnivale'' |date=[[February 9]], [[2006]] |publisher=mediavillage.com |accessdate=2007-07-25}}</ref> This seems very unlikely now.

==Lawsuit==

On [[June 9]], [[2005]], a lawsuit was filed in United States District court by writer Jeff Bergquist. Mr. Bergquist claimed that the creators of ''Carnivàle'' did not originate the idea for the show, but rather stole it from his unpublished novel ''Beulah''. Mr. Bergquist claimed that HBO and ''Carnivàle'' creator Daniel Knauf violated his copyright on ''Beulah'' and sought both recognition and punitive damages.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05178/528920.stm |title=TV Notes: 'Carnivale' copied? |date=[[June 27]], [[2005]] |publisher=post-gazette.com |accessdate=2007-07-28}}</ref> The case was [[Prejudice (law)|dismissed with prejudice]] on [[February 17]], [[2006]].{{dubious|date=July 2007}}

=== Critical reviews===

Many early reviews gave ''Carnivàle'' good marks but also stated that its unique characters and story might prevent it from becoming a huge main stream audience success.<ref name=cnn /> ''[[Daily Variety]]''  TV editor Joseph Adalian predicted that "it will get mostly positive reviews but some people will be put off by the general weirdness of the show."<ref name=cnn>{{cite web | last=Doty | first=Meriah | title=Taking a tour with 'Carnivale' | url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/TV/09/11/sprj.caf03.carnivale/ | date=[[September 11]], [[2003]] | publisher = cnn.com | accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref> Phil Gallo of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' described ''Carnivàle'' as "an absolute visual stunner with compelling freak-show characters -- but the series unfortunately takes a leisurely approach toward getting to a point,"<ref name=vareity_review1>{{cite web | last=Gallo | first=Phil | title=Recently Reviewed - Carnivale | url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117921817.html?categoryid=32&cs=1 | date=[[September 11]], [[2003]] | publisher=variety.com | accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref> whereas James Poniewozik of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' called the first three episodes "frustrating" as well as "spellbinding."<ref name=time.com>{{cite web | last=Poniewozik | first=James | title = HBO's Cirque du So-So | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,483299,00.html | date=[[September 7]], [[2003]] | publisher=time.com | accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref> Amanda Murray of BBC said "With so little revealed, it's almost impossible to pass judgment on the show - it's hard to tell if this is just good, or going to be great."<ref name=bbc>{{cite web | last=Murray | first=Amanda | title=Review: Carnivale | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/news/cult/2004/09/13/14282.shtml | date=[[September 13]], [[2004]] | publisher=bbc.co.uk | accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref>
