==Early life==
Born in [[Shoreditch]], [[London]] in 1937,<ref>GRO Register of Births: SEP 1937 1a 176 STEPNEY - Barbara A. Deeks, mmn = Ellis</ref> Windsor was the only child of a [[costermonger]] and [[dressmaker]], John and Rose Deeks. She passed the [[Eleven plus|11 plus]] exam with high marks, and her mother paid for her to have elocution lessons. She trained at the Aida Foster School in [[Golders Green]], making her stage debut at 13 and her West End debut in 1952 in the chorus of the musical ''Love From Judy''.

Her first film role was in ''[[The Belles of St Trinian's]]'' in 1954. She joined [[Joan Littlewood]]'s [[Theatre Workshop]] at the Theatre Royal, Stratford East, coming to prominence in their stage production ''Fings Ain't Wot They Used to Be'' and Littlewood's film ''[[Sparrows Can't Sing]]'' in 1963, achieving a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] nomination for Best British Film Actress. She also appeared in the 1964 film comedy ''[[Crooks in Cloisters]]'' and in the sitcoms ''[[The Rag Trade]]'' and ''[[Wild, Wild Women]]''.

==''Carry On'' films==
However, Windsor came to real prominence with her portrayals of a 'good time girl' in nine [[Carry On films|''Carry On'' films]] – beginning with ''[[Carry On Spying]]'' and ending with ''[[Carry On Dick]]'' – and several TV and compilation specials between 1964 and 1977. 

Her most famous scene was in ''[[Carry On Camping]]'' during which she was doing outdoor aerobic exercises and her bikini top flew off. 

From 1973 to 1975 she appeared with several of the ''[[Carry On]]'' team in the [[West End]] revue ''Carry On London!''. During this time, she had a well-publicised affair with her co-star, [[Sid James]].

However, she was identified with the ''[[Carry On]]'' films for many years and this restricted the roles she was allowed to play later.

== Theatre career ==
She also starred on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in the Theatre Workshop's ''[[Oh! What a Lovely War]]'' and received a 1965 [[Tony Award]] nomination for [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Musical|Best Featured Actress in a Musical]]. She also appeared in [[Lionel Bart]]'s musical flop ''Twang!'' (directed by [[Joan Littlewood]]) and in the musical ''Come Spy with Me'' with [[Danny La Rue]].

In 1970 she landed the role of [[Marie Lloyd]] in the musical-biopic ''Sing Rude a Song''. In 1972 she appeared in the [[West End]] in [[Tony Richardson]]'s ''The Threepenny Opera'' with his then wife, [[Vanessa Redgrave]]. In 1975 toured the UK, New Zealand and South Africa in her own show, ''Carry On Barbara!'', and followed this with the role of Maria in ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' at the [[Chichester Festival Theatre]].

In 1981 she played sex-mad landlady Kath in [[Joe Orton]]'s black comedy ''[[Entertaining Mr Sloane]]'' at the [[Lyric Hammersmith]], directed by her friend, [[Kenneth Williams]]. She reprised the role for a national tour in 1993.

== ''EastEnders'' ==
In 1994, Windsor's fortunes picked up when she took over the role of Queen Vic landlady and mother of the Mitchell boys, [[Peggy Mitchell]], in the BBC soap ''[[EastEnders]]''. For this role, she received the Best Actress award at the [[British Soap Awards]] in 1999. In 2005, Windsor returned to the show after a two-year break. She appeared briefly in the 2006 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode "[[Army of Ghosts]]" as Peggy Mitchell in a fictional episode of ''EastEnders''. She also appeared in a [[Children in Need]] ''[[The Catherine Tate Show]]'' special alongside [[Kacey Ainsworth]] and [[Lacey Turner]].

== Recent years ==
In 1999 she made her record debut with fellow ''[[EastEnders]]'' cast member [[Mike Reid]] with ''The More I See You''. The year 2000 was one of accolades. She was made an [[MBE]] in the Millennium Honours List, was inducted into the first BBC Hall of Fame and had a waxwork of her unveiled at [[Madame Tussauds]]. She also published her autobiography, ''All of Me''.

After a debilitating case of the [[Epstein-Barr virus]] forced a two-year absence from ''EastEnders'' from 2003 to 2005, with just a return for two episodes in 2004, she rejoined the cast in the summer of 2005 and signed a one-year contract. 

Windsor examined her family tree in the first episode of the third series of the documentary series ''[[Who Do You Think You Are?]]'', which aired on [[6 September]] [[2006]], in which she traced her family tree back 11 generations to John Golding, the great-great-grandfather of the painter [[John Constable]], making him Windsor's fourth cousin six times removed.

Windsor hosted an episode of the ''[[The Sunday Night Project]]'' on [[13 July]] [[2008]] and has made regular television appearances on shows such as ''[[The Graham Norton Show]]'' and ''[[The Paul O'Grady Show]]''
