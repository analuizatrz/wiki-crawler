'''Surface diffusion''' is a general process involving the motion of [[atom]]s, [[molecule]]s, and atomic clusters (adparticles) at material [[surface]]s.  Just as in bulk [[diffusion]], this motion is typically a thermally promoted process with rates increasing with increasing temperature.  Surface diffusion is affected by a variety of factors including the strength of the surface-adparticle [[chemical bond|bond]], orientation of the surface lattice, attraction and repulsion between surface species, [[chemical potential]] gradients, etc.  It is an important concept in surface [[phase transition|phase formation]], [[epitaxial growth]], heterogeneous [[catalysis]], and other topics in [[surface science]].

===Kinetics===
Surface diffusion kinetics can be thought of in terms of adatoms residing at [[adsorption]] sites on a 2D [[lattice group|lattice]], moving between adjacent (nearest-neighbor) adsorption sites by a jumping process.  The jump rate is characterized by an attempt [[frequency]] and a [[thermodynamic]] factor which dictates the probability of an attempt resulting in a successful jump.  The attempt frequency <math>\nu\,\!</math> is typically taken to be simply the [[molecular vibration|vibrational frequency]] of the adatom, while the thermodynamic factor is a [[Boltzmann factor]] dependent on temperature and E<sub>diff</sub>, the [[potential energy|potential]] barrier to diffusion. Equation 1 describes the relationship:
{|
|-
|<math>\Gamma = \nu e^{-E_{diff} /k_BT} \qquad (1)</math>
|}
Where <math>\nu\,\!</math> and E<sub>diff</sub> are as described above, <math>\Gamma\,\!</math> is the jump or hopping rate, T is temperature, and k<sub>B</sub> is the [[Boltzmann constant]].  E<sub>diff</sub> must be smaller than the energy of desorption for diffusion to occur, otherwise desorption processes would dominate.  The manner in which diffusion takes place is dependent on the relationship between E<sub>diff</sub> and k<sub>B</sub>T as is given in the thermodynamic factor:  when E<sub>diff</sub> is less than k<sub>B</sub>T the thermodynamic factor approaches unity and E<sub>diff</sub> ceases to be a meaningful barrier to diffusion-this case is known as mobile diffusion.  For the phenomena described throughout this article, E<sub>diff</sub> is assumed to be >> k<sub>B</sub>T and therefore <math>\Gamma \ll \nu \,\!</math>.  In the case of [[Fick%27s_law_of_diffusion|Fickian diffusion]] it is possible to extract both the <math>\nu\,\!</math> and E<sub>diff</sub>  from an [[Arrhenius plot]] of the log  of the diffusion coefficient, D, versus 1/T.

[[Random walk]] statistics describe the mean square displacement of diffusing species in terms of the number of jumps <math>N\,\!</math> and the distance per jump <math>a\,\!</math>.  The number of successful jumps is simply <math>\Gamma\,\!</math> multiplied by the time allowed for diffusion, <math>t\,\!</math>.  In the most basic model only nearest-neighbor jumps are considered and <math>a\,\!</math> corresponds to the spacing between nearest-neighbor adsorption sites.  The root mean square displacement <math>\sqrt{<\Delta r^2>} = a\sqrt{vt}\,\!</math>.  The diffusion coefficient is given as <math>D = \tfrac{v a^2}{z}\,\!</math> where z = 2 for 1D diffusion as would be the case for in-channel diffusion, z = 4 as in a [[square lattice]], and z = 6 as in a [[hexagonal lattice]].

=== Regimes===
[[Image:Chemical surface diffusion slow.gif|thumb|288px|right|Figure 2.  Model of six adatoms diffusing across a square surface lattice.  The adatoms block each other from moving to adjacent sites.  As per [[Fick%27s_law_of_diffusion|Fickâ€™s law]], flux is in the opposite direction of the concentration gradient.  The model is not intended to show repulsion or attraction, and is not to scale on a spatial or temporal basis.]]
Four terms describe the different general schemes in which diffusion may take place.  Tracer diffusion and chemical diffusion differ in the level of adsorbate coverage at the surface, while intrinsic diffusion and mass transfer diffusion differ in the nature of the diffusion environment.  Tracer diffusion and intrinsic diffusion both refer to systems where adparticles experience a relatively homogenous environment.  
*'''Tracer diffusion''' describes the motion of individual adparticles on a surface at relatively low coverage levels.  At these low levels (< 0.01 [[monolayer]]), particle interaction is low and each particle can be considered to move independently of the others.
*'''Chemical diffusion''' describes the process at higher level of coverage where the effects of attraction or repulsion between adatoms becomes important.  These interactions serve to alter the mobility of adatoms.  In a crude way, figure 2 serves to show how adatoms may interact at higher coverage levels.  The adatoms have no "choice" but to move to the right at first, and adjacent adatoms may block adsorption sites from one another.
*'''Intrinsic diffusion''' occurs on a uniform surface (e.g. lacking steps or vacancies) such as a single terrace.  This regime is often studied using [[field ion microscopy]], wherein the terrace is a sharp sample tip on which an adparticle diffuses.  Even in the case of a clean terrace the process may be influenced by non-uniformity near the edges of the terrace.
*'''Mass transfer diffusion''' takes place in the case where adparticle sources and traps such as kinks, steps, and vacancies are present.  Instead of being dependent only on the jump potential barrier E<sub>diff</sub>, diffusion in this regime is now also dependent on the formation energy of mobile adparticles.  The exact nature of the diffusion environment therefore plays a role in dictating the diffusion rate, since the formation energy of an adparticle is different for each type of surface feature as is described in the [[TSK model|terrace-step-kink model]].
