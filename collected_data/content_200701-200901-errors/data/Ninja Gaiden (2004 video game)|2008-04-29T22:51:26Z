'''''Ninja Gaiden''''' is an [[action-adventure game]] for the [[Xbox]] [[video game console]]. [[Team Ninja]] had developed the game for five years before [[Tecmo]] released it in 2004. Although it used the title and [[Protagonist|main character]] of the [[Ninja Gaiden (video game)|1990s series]] on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], it moved the setting to that of the [[Dead or Alive (series)|''Dead or Alive'' series]].

''Ninja Gaiden'' was Team Ninja's first foray into the action market. The player controls the [[ninja]], [[Ryu Hayabusa]], from a [[Third-person shooter|third-person view]]. He has to fight hordes of foes in various places to retrieve a stolen blade and avenge the deaths of the Hayabusa clan. The game offers many weapons and large amounts of gore. Players across the world also took part in record-breaking online contests that climaxed in a final held at [[Tokyo Game Show|Tokyo Game Show 2004]].

Team Ninja went on working on the game after its release and released new game modes over [[Xbox Live]]. The new features evolved the gameplay and this carried on in the 2005 Xbox [[Reissue|re-release]], ''Ninja Gaiden Black'', which added another game mode. The last re-release was ''Ninja Gaiden Sigma'' for the [[PlayStation 3]] in 2007.

The game has received much critical acclaim; several critics called it one of the best and most difficult video games ever made, and inducted it into their Halls of Fame. Although the game was a hit in [[North America]], it received a lukewarm response in [[Japan]]. The ''Ninja Gaiden'' saga goes on in ''[[Ninja Gaiden Dragon Sword]]'' on the [[Nintendo DS]] and ''[[Ninja Gaiden II (2008 video game)|Ninja Gaiden II]]'' on the [[Xbox 360]].

The primary game mode of ''Ninja Gaiden'' is Story Mode. It follows the pacing of a typical [[action-adventure game]]; the protagonist is weak at the beginning and grows more powerful as the story progresses. ''[[The Legend of Zelda (series)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' video game series inspired Team Ninja to reward exploration and hunting for items in their game; players search for keys or solve puzzles to remove obstacles in their path, and gather items to upgrade Ryu's abilities and weapons.<ref name="gsngrev" /><ref name="sigpre">{{cite web

===Combat system===
Reviewers praised ''Ninja Gaiden'' for having one of the deeper combat engines for an [[Xbox]] game, and for its responsive and smooth controls. Players can easily control Ryu's fighting moves with the left [[analog stick|thumbstick]], three attack buttons, and a block button.<ref>{{cite web

  | quote = This gripping feeling is accentuated by the game's controls, which are both fluid and responsive, whether in the pure platform-like sections (think ''[[Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time]]'', especially when Ryu's running along walls or flipping himself out of pits) or the core of the game's challenge, the combat sections. }}

</ref> ''[[God of War]]'' lead combat engine designer, Eric Williams, explained that the combat engine of ''Ninja Gaiden'' prohibits players from stopping or changing attacks in mid-stroke. In contrast, ''God of War'' allows players to cancel and change attacks anytime, and ''[[Devil May Cry]]'' grants this freedom to certain attacks. Williams stated that compared to those two games, ''Ninja Gaiden'' has a more difficult combat system to master but sets up a fair playing field for the player.<ref>{{cite web

[[Image:Ninja Gaiden Sewer Fight.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The character, Ryu, can run along walls to dodge his enemies.]]
''Ninja Gaiden'' offers the player a large selection of weapons. There are swords such as the Dragon Sword and Kitetsu, which allow for quick attacks. Ryu can leap and cut through foes with these weapons in a move called the Flying Swallow. He can also perform his signature Izuna Drop&mdash;an aerial spinning [[piledriver (professional wrestling)|piledriver]]&mdash;to smash foes into the ground with upgraded versions of these weapons. Heavy weapons, such as the Dabilahro and the Unlabored Flawlessness, are slow but powerful. The player can make Ryu string together long sequences of [[combo (video games)|combo]] attacks with [[flail]]s and [[Staff (stick)|staves]]. Ryu can also throw [[shuriken]]s and shoot arrows at distant foes.<ref>{{cite web

Essences are colored globes of energy released on the death of enemies. They are an important part of the gameplay; they serve as [[power-up]]s by healing Ryu, restoring his magic, or increasing his cash. Essences go into Ryu’s body when he is near them.

</ref> In later versions of ''Ninja Gaiden'', these techniques award points, making them an integral part of high scoring play.

Lastly, the player can make Ryu cast ninpos such as fireballs, ice storms, or bolts of lightning.

Team Ninja paid attention to details in their creation of [[3D modeling|3D computer models]] for the game; they studied human anatomy to create skeletal and muscle structures for the characters.

===Story===
The story of ''Ninja Gaiden'' starts two years before the first [[Dead or Alive (arcade game)|''DOA'' game]].<ref name="teamxbox_int" /> [[Cut scene]]s set up the beginning and conclusion of each chapter. Players take control of Ryu in an invasion of the Shadow clan fortress at the start of the game. Ryu is there to visit the clan leader, [[List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Ninjas|Murai]], who is his uncle. A cut scene shows the female ninja, [[List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Supporting characters 2|Ayane]], interrupting the talk between Ryu and Murai; she delivers news of a raid on the Hayabusa village. Ryu fights his way back to his village and encounters Doku who has taken the Dark Dragon Blade and killed Kureha, the Hayabusa [[miko|shrine maiden]]. The encounter ends with a cut scene of Doku cutting Ryu down with the Blade. A [[falcon]] watches over Ryu's body as the screen [[Fade (film)|fades out]]. It is the spiritual animal of the Hayabusas and brings him back to life offscreen.<ref>{{cite journal

Kureha's death causes Ryu to seek revenge on the raiders.<ref name="gmr" /> After Murai tells him that they were from the Vigoor Empire, he hides on a Zeppelin to sneak into the country. Ayane performs as a guide throughout the game; she informs the player of objectives and tips to handle situations. Ryu fights through the streets of Tairon, cutting down those who stand in his way. While players have to fight most of the characters they meet, two of them are there to help. [[List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Supporting characters 2|Muramasa]], the [[bladesmith]], has shops spread over the game world, and players can buy or upgrade items from him. He also gives [[back-story|back-stories]], [[quest (gaming)|quest]]s, and crucial information; he tells Ryu to find the Dragon Eye jewel at the Hayabusa village to upgrade the Dragon Sword to its full potential.

The player faces several [[boss (video games)|boss]]es in Ryu's rampage through Tairon. Most of them are giant nonhuman fiends and the humanoid bosses include the three Greater Fiends.

Although the tournaments had ended, Microsoft has allowed the ranking boards to remain active for players to upload their scores.

==Remakes and merchandise==
Tecmo published two remakes of ''Ninja Gaiden'': ''Ninja Gaiden Black'' and ''Ninja Gaiden Sigma''. They are at heart the same game as the original, telling the same story about Ryu and the Dark Dragon Blade. Tomonobu Itagaki had considered ''Black'' to be the final version of ''Ninja Gaiden''.<ref name="devint" /> However, Tecmo brought the game to the PS3 and released ''Sigma'' as the last remake of ''Ninja Gaiden''.

Itagaki made the other difficulties in ''Black'' to be harder than those in ''Ninja Gaiden''. He made the foes stronger and more aggressive. He also gave most of them grapple attacks to discourage players from being too defensive ([[turtle (game term)|turtling]]). Itagaki further [[Game balance|balanced the game]] by toning down moves that proved too powerful such as the Flying Swallow.<ref name="denngb" /> The game also introduced new foes such as exploding bats and the doppelganger fiends who imitate Ryu.<ref name="ngb1uprev">{{cite web

One mission is adapted from the game played in the World Wide Master Ninja Tournament 2004 finals. The last five missions link together to make up Eternal Legend; it is a revamped Hurricane Pack 2 using the game engine of Black.<ref name="ngbpre" />

''Ninja Gaiden'' received a lot of critical acclaim. [[GameSpot]] called it as "one of the best most challenging action adventure games ever made".<ref name="gsngrev" /> [[IGN]] said that it "sets a new standard for third-person action games in terms of length, depth, speed, and gore".<ref name="ignngrev" /> Critics also put forward the game as one of the most difficult games up to 2007.<ref>{{cite web

</ref> Its remake, ''Ninja Gaiden Black'', still impressed critics. GameSpot hailed it for having the best visual and audio presentation on the Xbox. They also praised its new feature, Mission Mode, for "[distilling] the game down to its purest essentials".<ref name="gsngbrev" /> IGN called its release as "a rare and welcome day", which "[brought their] excitement levels back to the first time [they] played the game".<ref name="ignngbrev" />

From a technical point of view, critics regarded ''Ninja Gaiden'' and ''Black'' as the best of Xbox software; they pushed the console hardware to its limits without showing significant drops in performance. GameSpot was impressed with their "first-rate presentation" and said that none of the games at that time came close in visuals and audios.<ref name="gsngbrev" /> IGN said the games could "make [them] momentarily forget about the next generation of consoles".<ref name="ignngbrev" /> ''Ninja Gaiden'' and ''Black'' were top-selling Xbox games, which led to them being [[backward compatibility|compatible]] with the [[Xbox 360]] for all regions on its release.<ref>{{cite news

However, critics varied in their views on the technical aspects of ''Ninja Gaiden Sigma''. The gaming site, [[1UP.com]], called the updated graphics as "a gorgeous reworking of the modern ninja classic".<ref name="sig1uprev" /> [[Pro-G]], however, said that they were average by next-generation standards and showed occasional "tearing, jagged edges, and miss matched collision between bloodstains and walls".<ref name="prosigrev" /> Various flaws also troubled 1UP. They encountered frequent loadings, even in combat despite installing the game on the local hard drive. They also saw visual glitches such as [[screen tearing]] when the camera moved. These flaws made the game "feel like a bit of a slapdash port".<ref name="sig1uprev" />

Although critics praised ''Sigma'' for retaining the gameplay in the previous games,<ref name="ignau" /><ref name="sig1uprev" /> its lack of new attractive features made them question its worth as "a remake of a remake". Pro-G said that ''Sigma'' was not worth a full priced game because it "has, in effect, been available for years in one form or another".<ref name="prosigrev" /> [[Eurogamer]] stated that ''Sigma'' lacked the "wow factor" when compared to ''[[God of War (video game)|God of War]]'' and ''[[God of War II|its sequel]]''.<ref name="eusigrev" /> The 1UP critic said that shaking the Sixaxis to power up a ninpo was "silly" and a "foolishly tacked-on" way to use the controller.<ref name="sig1uprev" /> IGN was not excited about playing as Rachel and wished to "get back to Ryu's sections simply because he's more fun to play".<ref name="ignsigrev" /> DailyGame, however, said that her slow pace brings "much-needed respite for newcomers and provide something new for experienced players".<ref>{{cite web

A common criticism of the ''Ninja Gaiden'' games was with the camera. The default camera system centers the action on Ryu and his surroundings. It has also improved with the use of manual controls since the ''Hurricane Packs''.<ref name="hurhands1" /><ref name="gsngbrev" /> There are, however, times when the camera locks on to an object and loses track of Ryu, which made the critics mad.<ref name="ignngbrev" /><ref name="entdep" /><ref name="trend" /> However, most critics judged that either the camera was usually decent or the gameplay was good enough to cover up its flaws.<ref name="gsngbrev" /><ref name="ignsigrev" />

The ''Ninja Gaiden'' games gained a reputation throughout the gaming community for their difficulty and details.<ref name="history" /><ref>{{cite journal

</ref> Although they appealed to gamers who are like Pro-G in wanting a "bloody hard, but also bloody good" challenge,<ref name="prongrev" /> casual gamers might find the learning curve daunting. IGN warned that gamers with lesser skills might not "get as much out of this game as others due to [its] incredible difficulty".<ref name="ignngbrev" /> Clive Thompson focused on ''Ninja Gaiden'' in his ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' article on the rewards of beating difficult games. He said that there are games so hard that players get mad in trying to beat them and stay mad even after doing so. ''Ninja Gaiden'', however, rewarded players who beat the game; it brought them "a sort of exhausted exhilaration, like finally reaching the end of ''[[War and Peace]]''". The game was a success in striking balance between challenge and reward.<ref>{{cite web
