'''''Another Perfect Day''''' is the seventh album by the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Motörhead]]. The album was released in 1983 and reached number 20 in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] charts.

After guitarist [[Eddie Clarke|"Fast" Eddie Clarke]] left Motörhead on their second [[United States|US]] tour, [[Brian Robertson|Brian "Robbo" Robertson]] (ex-[[Thin Lizzy]]) was drafted to complete the tour. On their return to the [[United Kingdom|UK]] the band recorded their most unique and controversial album - ''Another Perfect Day''.

Although it is the most melodic and unique album Motörhead had ever recorded, the fans were not pleased; Robertson and [[Phil "Philthy Animal" Taylor|Taylor]] went to form the band ''Operator'' and Lemmy went on with Motörhead, forming the new line-up of Kilmister, Campbell, Burston, Gill.

In 1988 Castle Communications re-issued this album  along with ''[[Overkill (album)|Overkill]]'' – in a gatefold sleeve.
