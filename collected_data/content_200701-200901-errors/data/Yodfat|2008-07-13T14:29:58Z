==History==
===Antiquity===
[[Image:Almog IL5 Yodfat.jpg|250px|thumb|The hilltop where the fortress stood during the [[Great Revolt]].]]
In 67 CE, Yodfat was the site of a fierce battle described by [[Josephus Flavius]], the commander of the Galilee in the [[Great Revolt]], in his later chronicle of the Jewish wars against the Romans.  The city was guarded by a hilltop fortress accessible only from the north.  [[Vespasian]] pitched his camp on the northern side of the city and held it under siege for 47 days. Vespasian was wounded in the battle. 40,000 Jews were killed and 1,000 women and children were sold into slavery. The city was razed and burned on the first of the Hebrew month of [[Tammuz]].<ref>http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=571&letter=J</ref>
Josephus himself was taken captive at Yodfat.<ref>http://www.tourism.gov.il/Tourism_Eng/Tourist+Information/Jewish+Themes/Jewish_Sites/Yodfat+jew.htm.</ref>
===After the fall===
After its capture by the Romans, Yodfat was repopulated by refugees from [[Jerusalem]], among them the priestly family of Miyamin.<ref> ''Encyclopedia Judaica, ''Joptapata'', Keter Publishing, Jerusalem, 1978, volume 10, p. 300.</ref> The city is mentioned in the [[Talmud]] as the home of Rabbi Menachem of Jotapata (Zev. 110b).<ref>''Encyclopedia Judaica, ''Joptapata'', Keter Publishing, Jerusalem, 1978, volume 10, p. 300.</ref>

In 1847, the site was identified with Khirbet Jifat, some 10 miles north of [[Sepphoris]].<ref>''Encyclopedia Judaica, ''Joptapata'', Keter Publishing, Jerusalem, 1978, volume 10, p. 300.</ref>

==Archaeology==
In 1999, archeological excavations revealed a mass grave containing human remains believed to be those of Jewish rebels who committed suicide rather than surrender to the Romans.<ref>http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Archaeology/recent.html</ref> Remains of fortifications and cisterns have also been found at the site.<ref>''Encyclopedia Judaica, ''Joptapata'', Keter Publishing, Jerusalem, 1978, volume 10, p. 300.</ref>

The nursery employs forty people and has an R&D facilities for developing new hybrids, among them Ornithogalum Dubium and cyclamen persicum.
