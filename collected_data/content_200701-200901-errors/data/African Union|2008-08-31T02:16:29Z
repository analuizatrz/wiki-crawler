{{Life in the African Union}}
The '''African Union''' (abbreviated '''AU''' in [[English language|English]], and '''UA''' in its other working languages) is a [[confederation]] consisting of 53&nbsp;[[Africa]]n [[nation]]s as well as several [[intergovernmental organizations]]. Established on [[July 9]] [[2002]], the AU was formed as a successor to the amalgamated [[African Economic Community]] (AEC) and the [[Organization of African Unity]] (OAU). The African Union's government consists of the [[Pan African Parliament]], which is based in [[Midrand]], [[South Africa]], and several institutions that include the [[African Union Commission]] which is based in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, the [[Assembly of the African Union]] which has at least one summit annually in a different city every year, and the [[NEPAD]] secretariat which is also based in Midrand, South Africa. 

== Overview ==
The main administrative capitals of the African Union are Midrand in South Africa, [[Addis Ababa]], [[Ethiopia]], and [[Dakar]] in [[Senegal]]. Among the objectives of the AU's leading institutions are to accelerate the political and socio-economic integration of the continent; to promote and defend African common positions on issues of interest to the continent and its peoples; to achieve peace and security in Africa; and to promote democratic institutions, good governance and [[human rights]].

The African Union, is made up of both political and administrative bodies. The highest political organ of the African Union is the [[Pan African Parliament]], also called the African Parliament. The parliament consists of 265 members, all of whom are elected by the parliaments of the AU member states. The president of the Pan African Parliament is Her Excellency [[Gertrude Mongella]]. The African Parliament is complemented by the [[Assembly of the African Union|Assembly]], made up of all the heads of state or government of member states of the AU and currently chaired by [[Jakaya Kikwete]], president of [[Tanzania]], elected at the 9th ordinary meeting of the Assembly in January 2008. The [[African Union Commission|AU Commission]], which functions is chaired by [[Jean Ping]] of [[Gabon]].

Other institutions of the AU include the Executive Council, made up of foreign ministers; the Permanent Representatives Committee, made up of the ambassadors to Addis Ababa of AU member states; the [[Pan African Parliament]]; and the [[Economic, Social, and Cultural Council]] (ECOSOCC), a civil society consultative body (see further below). 

The AU covers the entire continent<ref> There is the minor exception of the cities of [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]], two autonomous [[Spain|Spanish]] enclaves on the Mediterranean coast. </ref> except for [[Morocco]], which opposes the membership of [[Western Sahara]] as the [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]]. However, Morocco has a special status within the AU and benefits from the services available to all AU states from the institutions of the AU, such as the [[African Development Bank]]. Moroccan delegates also participate at important AU functions, and negotiations continue to try to resolve the conflict with the [[Polisario Front]] in [[Tindouf]], [[Algeria]] and [[Free Zone (Western Sahara region)|parts of Western Sahara]].

The AU's first military intervention in a member state was the May 2003 deployment of a peacekeeping force of soldiers from [[South Africa]], [[Ethiopia]], and [[Mozambique]] to [[Burundi]] to oversee the implementation of the various agreements. AU troops were also deployed in [[Sudan]] for peacekeeping in the [[Darfur conflict]], before the mission was handed over to the United Nations on 1 January 2008 [[UNAMID]]. The AU also has sent a peacekeeping mission to [[Somalia]], of which the peacekeeping troops are from Uganda and Burundi.

The AU has adopted a number of important new documents establishing norms at continental level, to supplement those already in force when it was created. These include the African Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption (2003) and the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance (2007), as well as the [[New Partnership for Africa's Development]] and its associated Declaration on Democracy, Political, Economic and Corporate Governance.<ref>AU treaties available at: http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/Documents/Treaties/treaties.htm</ref>

====Morocco's withdrawal====
The only African state that is not a member of the African Union is [[Morocco]], which left the AU's predecessor, the [[Organization of African Unity]] (OAU), in 1984, when many of the other member states supported the [[Sahrawi]] [[Nationalism|nationalist]] [[Polisario Front]]'s [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1428796.stm BBC News (July 8 2001) - "OAU considers Morocco readmission"] (accessed July 9, 2006).</ref><ref>[http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/020709/2002070920.html Arabic News (July 9 2002) - "South African paper says Morocco should be one of the AU and NEPAD leaders"] (Accessed July 9, 2006)</ref> Morocco's ally, [[Zaire]], similarly opposed the OAU's admission of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, and the [[Mobutu Sese Seko|Mobutu]] regime boycotted the organisation from 1984 to 1986.<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+zr0178) ''Zaire: A Country Study'', "Relations with North Africa"] <small>(accessed [[May 18]], [[2007]])</small></ref> Some countries have since retracted their support for the Sahrawi Republic.<ref>[http://www.map.ma/eng/sections/politics/togo_confirms_to_au/view Togo confirms to AU withdrawal of recognition of SADR] (accessed July 9, 2006).</ref>
{{seealso|List of African Union member states by political system|List of African Union member states by population}}

==Organs of the AU==
{{Politics of the African Union}}
The African Union has a number of official bodies:

; [[Pan-African Parliament]] (PAP) : To become the highest legislative body of the African Union. The seat of the PAP is at [[Midrand]], [[South Africa]]. The Parliament is composed of 265&nbsp;elected representatives from all 53&nbsp;AU states, and intended to provide popular and civil-society participation in the processes of democratic governance. The current President of the Pan African Parliament is [[Gertrude Mongella]] of [[Tanzania]]. 

; [[Assembly of the African Union]] : Composed of heads of state and heads of government of AU states, the Assembly is currently the supreme governing body of the African Union. It is gradually devolving some of its decision-making powers to the Pan African Parliament. It meets once a year and makes its decisions by consensus or by a two-thirds majority.  The [[As of 2008|current]] Chairman of the Assembly is [[Jakaya Kikwete]], president of [[Tanzania]].

; [[African Union Commission]] : The [[secretariat]] of the African Union, composed of ten commissioners and supporting staff and headquartered in [[Addis Ababa]], [[Ethiopia]]. In a similar fashion to its [[European Union|European]] counterpart, the [[European Commission]], it is responsible for the administration and co-ordination of the AU's activities and meetings.

; [[African Court of Justice]] : The Constitutive Act provides for a Court of Justice to rule on disputes over interpretation of AU treaties. A protocol to set up the Court of Justice was adopted in 2003, but has not yet entered into force: it is likely to be superseded by a protocol creating a Court of Justice and Human Rights, which will incorporate the already established African Court of Justice and Human and Peoples' Rights (see below) and have two chambers&mdash;one for general legal matters and one for rulings on the human rights treaties. The draft protocol has been under discussion for several years and is likely to be adopted during 2008.

; [[Executive Council of the African Union|Executive Council]]: Composed of ministers designated by the governments of member states.  It decides on matters such as foreign trade, social security, food, agriculture and communications, is accountable to the Assembly, and prepares material for the Assembly to discuss and approve. 

; [[Permanent Representatives' Committee of the African Union|Permanent Representatives' Committee]]: Consisting of nominated permanent representatives of member states, the Committee prepares the work for the Executive Council. (European Union equivalent: the [[Committee of Permanent Representatives]] (COREPER).)

; [[Peace and Security Council]] (PSC): Proposed at the Lusaka Summit in 2001 and established in 2004 under a protocol to the Constitutive Act adopted by the AU Assembly in July 2002. The protocol defines the PSC as a collective security and early warning arrangement to facilitate timely and effective response to conflict and crisis situations in Africa. Other responsibilities conferred to the PSC by the protocol include prevention, management and resolution of conflicts, post-conflict peace building and developing common defence policies. The PSC has fifteen members elected on a regional basis by the Assembly. Similar in intent and operation to the [[United Nations Security Council]]. 

; [[Economic, Social and Cultural Council]]: An advisory organ composed of professional and civic representatives, similar to the European [[Economic and Social Committee]].  The interim chair of ECOSOCC is Nobel prizewinner [[Wangari Maathai]] of [[Kenya]].

; [[Specialised Technical Committees of the African Union|Specialised Technical Committees]]: Both the Abuja Treaty and the Constitutive Act provide for Specialised Technical Committees to be established made up of African ministers to advise the Assembly. In practice, they have never been set up. The ten proposed themes are: Rural Economy and Agricultural Matters; Monetary and Financial Affairs; Trade, Customs, and Immigration; Industry, Science and Technology; Energy, Natural Resources, and Environment; Transport, Communications, and Tourism; Health; Labour, and Social Affairs; Education, Culture, and Human Resources.

; Financial institutions: [[African Central Bank]], [[African Investment Bank]], [[African Monetary Fund]]. These institutions have not yet been established. Eventually, the AU aims to have a single currency (the [[Afro (currency)|Afro]]).

; Human rights : The [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights]], in existence since 1986, is established under the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]] (the African Charter) rather than the Constitutive Act of the African Union. It is the premier African human rights body, with responsibility for monitoring and promoting compliance with the African Charter.  The [[African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights]] was established in 2006 to supplement the work of the Commission, following the entry into force of a protocol to the African Charter providing for its creation. It is planned that the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights will be merged with the African Court of Justice (see above).

==Role of the diaspora==
The Constitutive Act of the AU declares that it shall "invite and encourage the full participation of the [[African diaspora]] as an important part of our Continent, in the building of the African Union". The African Union Government has defined the African diaspora as "consisting of people of African origin living outside the continent, irrespective of their citizenship and nationality and who are willing to contribute to the development of the continent and the building of the African Union".<ref>[http://www.siue.edu/~mafolay/JournalInfo/Vol-2/Issue%201%20revised.pdf ''Pan-Africanism and the African Union''], Dallas L. Browne.</ref>

== Current issues ==

The AU faces many challenges, including health issues such as combating [[malaria]] and the [[AIDS]]/[[HIV]] epidemic; political issues such as confronting [[liberal democracy|undemocratic]] regimes and mediating in the many [[civil war]]s; economic issues such as improving the [[Human Development Index|standard of living]] of millions of [[poverty|impoverished]], uneducated Africans; ecological issues such as dealing with recurring [[famine]]s, [[desertification]], and lack of ecological [[sustainability]]; as well as the [[international law|legal]] issues regarding [[Western Sahara]].

=== Union Government === 

The principal topic for debate at the July 2007 AU summit held in Accra, Ghana, was the creation of a Union Government<ref>Decision on the Report of the 9th Extraordinary session of the executive council on the proposals for the Union Government, DOC.Assembly/AU/10 (VIII), Assembly/AU/Dec.156 (VIII).</ref>, with the aim of moving towards a United States of Africa. A study on the Union Government was adopted in late 2006,<ref>Study on an African Union Government: Towards a United States of Africa, 2006. See also, Decision on the Union Government, Doc. Assembly/AU/2(VII).</ref> and proposes various options for "completing" the African Union project. There are divisions among African states on the proposals, with some (notably Libya) following a maximalist view leading to a common government with an AU army; and others (especially the southern African states) supporting rather a strengthening of the existing structures, with some reforms to deal with administrative and political challenges in making the AU Commission and other bodies truly effective.<ref>For further discussion of this proposal see http://www.pambazuka.org/aumonitor/</ref>

Following a heated debate in Accra, the Assembly of Heads of State and Government agreed in the form of a declaration to review the state of affairs of the AU with a view to determining its readiness towards a Union Government.<ref>Accra Declaration, Assembly of the Union at its 9th Ordinary session in Accra, Ghana, 1–3 July 2007.</ref> In particular, the Assembly agreed to: 
	
* Accelerate the economic and political integration of the African continent, including the formation of a Union Government of Africa; 
* Conduct an audit of the institutions and organs of the AU; review the relationship between the AU and the RECs; find ways to strengthen the AU and elaborate a timeframe to establish a Union Government. 

The declaration lastly noted the ‘importance of involving the African peoples, including Africans in the Diaspora, in the processes leading to the formation of the Union Government.’

Following this decision, a panel of eminent persons  was set up to conduct the ‘audit review’.  The review team began its work on 1 September 2007.   The review was presented to the Assembly of Heads of State and Government at the January 2008 summit in Addis Ababa. No final decision was taken on the recommendations, however, and a committee of ten heads of state was appointed to consider the review and report back to the July 2008 summit to be held in Egypt.<ref>[http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/Conferences/2008/january/summit/docs/decisions/Assembly.Dec_171%20-%20192%20_X_%20-%20Addis_February_2008.pdf''Decision on the Report of the Executive Council on the Audit of the Union and the Report of the Ministerial Committee on the Union Government, Doc. Assembly/Au/8(X).'']</ref>

=== Role of Regional Economic Communities ===
One of the key debates in relation to the achievement of greater continental integration is the relative priority that should be given to integration of the continent as a unit in itself or to integration of the sub-regions. The 1980 Lagos Plan of Action for the Development of Africa and the 1991 treaty to establish the African Economic Community (also referred to as the Abuja Treaty), proposed the creation of [[Regional Economic Communities]] (RECs) as the basis for African integration, with a timetable for regional and then continental integration to follow.<ref>See note on [http://www.dfa.gov.za/docs/2003/au0815.htm The Role of the Regional Economic Communities (RECs) as the Building Blocks of the African Union] prepared by the South African Department of Foreign Affairs.</ref>

Currently, there are eight RECs recognised by the AU, each established under a separate regional treaty. They are: 

* the [[Arab Maghreb Union]](UMA)
* the [[Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa]] (COMESA)
* the [[Community of Sahel-Saharan States]] (CEN-SAD) 
* the [[East African Community]] (EAC) 
* the [[Economic Community of Central African States]] (ECCAS)
* the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS)
* the [[Intergovernmental Authority on Development]] (IGAD)
* the [[Southern Africa Development Community]] (SADC)

The membership of many of the communities overlaps, and their rationalisation has been under discussion for several years – and formed the theme of the 2006 Banjul summit. At the July 2007 Accra summit the Assembly finally decided to adopt a Protocol on Relations between the African Union and the Regional Economic Communities.<ref>Decision on the Protocol on Relations between the African Union and the Regional Economic Communities (RECs), Assembly/AU/Dec.166 (IX).</ref> This protocol is intended to facilitate the harmonisation of policies and ensure compliance with the Abuja Treaty and Lagos Plan of Action time frames.

===Choosing the chair of the Union===
In 2006, the AU decided to create a Committee "to consider the implementation of a rotation system between the regions" in relation to the presidency. Controversy arose at the 2006 summit when Sudan announced its candidacy for the AU's chairmanship, as a representative of the East African region.  Several member states refused to support Sudan because of tensions over [[Darfur]] (see also below). Sudan ultimately withdrew its candidacy and President [[Denis Sassou-Nguesso]] of the [[Republic of the Congo]] was elected to a one-year term. At the January 2007 summit, Sassou-Nguesso was replaced by President [[John Agyekum Kufuor]] of Ghana, despite another attempt by Sudan to gain the chair. 2007 was the 50th anniversary of Ghana's independence, a symbolic moment for the country to hold the chair of the AU&mdash;and to host the mid-year summit at which the proposed Union Government was also discussed. In January 2008, President [[Jakaya Kikwete]] of Tanzania took over as chair, representing the East African region and thus apparently ending Sudan's attempt to become chair&mdash;at least till the rotation returns to East Africa.

=== Zimbabwe === 
The political crisis in [[Zimbabwe]] has been debated both by the African Union and in particular by the [[Southern African Development Community]]. At African Union level, the situation in Zimbabwe has been a controversial focus of discussions in the Executive Council of the activity reports of the [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights]] in which human rights abuses in Zimbabwe have been a leading subject since the early 2000s. Zimbabwe formed a major focus of debate at the 11th AU Summit held in Sharm el Shaik, Egypt, in July 2008, with some states, including Senegal, Benin, Burkina Faso, Zambia, Botswana, Nigeria, Kenya and others backing strong action against Zimbabwe in light of the problematic second round presidential elections held in June. Among others, [[Raila Odinga]], the [[Prime Minister]] of [[Kenya]], called for suspension of [[Robert Mugabe]] and Zimbabwe from the AU.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7481857.stm|title=Kenya urges AU to suspend Mugabe |date=2008-6-30|publisher=BBC|language=English|accessdate=2008-06-30}}</ref> However, the summit eventually adopted a resolution that did not apply any sanctions against the government of Robert Mugabe but merely urged the two main parties in Zimbabwe to negotiate a solution to their differences.<ref>[http://allafrica.com/stories/200807020018.html allAfrica.com: Africa: AU Summit Resolution On Zimbabwe (Page 1 of 1)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

=== AIDS in Africa ===
One of the most serious issues to face Africa is not a dispute between nations, but rather the rapid spread of [[HIV]] and the [[AIDS]] pandemic. [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], especially southern Africa, is by far the most affected area in the world, and the infection is now starting to claim lives by the millions. While the measurement of HIV prevalence rates has proved methodologically challenging, more than 20% of the sexually active population of many countries of southern Africa may be infected, with South Africa, Botswana, Kenya, Namibia, and Zimbabwe all expected to have a decrease in [[life expectancy]] by an average of 6.5 years. The effects on South Africa, which composes 30% of the AU's economy, threatens to significantly stunt GDP growth, and thus internal and external trade for the continent.

==Interventions in support of democracy==
===Togo===
In response to the death of [[Gnassingbé Eyadéma]], President of [[Togo]], on [[February 5]], [[2005]], AU leaders described the naming of his son [[Faure Gnassingbé]] the successor as a [[Coup d'état|military coup]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4240485.stm |title=AU denounces Togo 'military coup' |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-02-06 |accessdate = 2006-07-10}}</ref> Togo's constitution calls for the speaker of parliament to succeed the president in the event of his death. By law, the parliament speaker must call national elections to choose a new president within sixty days. The AU's protest forced Gnassingbé to hold elections. Under heavy allegations of election fraud, he was officially elected President on [[May 4]] [[2005]].

===Mauritania===
On [[August 3]] [[2005]], a coup in [[Mauritania]] led the African Union to suspend the country from all organisational activities. The Military Council that took control of Mauritania promised to hold elections within two years. These were held in early 2007, the first time that the country had held elections that were generally agreed to be of an acceptable standard.{{Fact|date=December 2007}}

== Regional conflicts and military interventions ==
One of the objectives of the AU is to "promote peace, security, and stability on the continent". <ref>Article 3(f) of the Constitutive Act.</ref> Among its principles is 'Peaceful resolution of conflicts among Member States of the Union through such appropriate means as may be decided upon by the Assembly'.<ref>Article 4(e) of the Constitutive Act.</ref> The primary body charged with implementing these objectives and principles is the Peace and Security Council. The PSC has the power, among other things, to authorise peace support missions, to impose sanctions in case of unconstitutional change of government, and to "take initiatives and action it deems appropriate" in response to potential or actual conflicts.  The PSC is a decision-making body in its own right, and its decisions are binding on member states. 

Article 4(h) of the Constitutive Act, repeated in article 4 of the Protocol to the Constitutive Act on the PSC, also recognises the right of the Union to intervene in member state in circumstances of war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity.  Any decision to intervene in a member state under article 4 of the Constitutive Act will be made by the Assembly on the recommendation of the PSC.  

Since it first met in 2004, the PSC has been active in relation to the crises in Darfur, Comoros, Somalia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, Côte d’Ivoire and other countries. It has adopted resolutions creating the AU peacekeeping operations in Somalia and Darfur, and imposing sanctions against persons undermining peace and security (such as travel bans and asset freezes against the leaders of the rebellion in Comoros). The Council is in the process of overseeing the establishment of a "standby force" to serve as a permanent African peacekeeping force.<ref>See Jakkie Cilliers, [http://www.issafrica.org/dynamic/administration/file_manager/file_links/PAPER160.PDF?link_id=3&slink_id=5753&link_type=12&slink_type=13&tmpl_id=3 'The African Standby Force. An Update on Progress], Institute for Security Studies, South Africa, March 2008.</ref> 

=== Darfur, Sudan ===
{{main|African Union Mission in Sudan}}
{{update}}

[[Image:African Mission in Sudan.jpg||thumb|AMIS peacekeepers in Darfur]]

In response to the ongoing [[Darfur conflict]] in [[Sudan]], the AU has deployed 7,000 peacekeepers, many from [[Rwanda]] and [[Nigeria]], to [[Darfur]]. While a donor's conference in [[Addis Ababa]] in 2005 helped raise funds to sustain the peacekeepers through that year and into 2006, in July 2006 the AU said it would pull out at the end of September when its mandate expires.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5124608.stm BBC NEWS | Africa | AU Darfur mission 'to end soon'<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Critics of the AU peacekeepers, including Dr. [[Eric Reeves]], have said these forces are largely ineffective due to lack of funds, personnel, and expertise. Monitoring an area roughly the size of [[France]] has made it even more difficult to sustain an effective mission. In June 2006, the United States [[US Congress|Congress]] appropriated US$173 million for the AU force. Some, such as the [[Genocide Intervention Network]], have called for [[United Nations]] (UN) or [[NATO]] intervention to augment and/or replace the AU peacekeepers. The UN has considered deploying a force, though it would not likely enter the country until at least October 2007.<ref>[http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs//2007/sc9089.doc.htm Security Council Authorizes Deployment Of United Nations-African Union ‘Hybrid’ Peace Operation In Bid To Resolve Darfur Conflict<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The under-funded and badly equipped AU mission was set to expire on [[December 31]], [[2006]] but was extended to [[June 30]], [[2007]] and will merge with the [[United Nations African Union Mission in Darfur]].

=== Somalia ===
{{main|African Union Mission to Somalia}}

[[Somalia]] has been effectively without a government since the early 1990s. A peace agreement aimed at ending the [[Somali Civil War]] that broke out following the fall of the regime of Siad Barre, was finally signed in 2006 after many years of peace talks. However, the new government was almost immediately threatened by further violence.  On [[March 6]] [[2007]], Ugandan AU soldiers arrived in [[Mogadishu]] as part of a peacekeeping force that is intended by the AU to eventually be 8,000 strong. [[Burundi]], [[Nigeria]], [[Malawi]] and [[Ghana]] are also expected to contribute, but have yet to do so.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2115736.stm BBC NEWS | Africa | African Union replaces dictators' club<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Somaliland]], in the north of Somalia, effectively operates as an independent country, though neither the AU nor any other international organisation has recognised it.

=== Anjouan, Comoros ===
{{main|2008 invasion of Anjouan}}
[[Mohamed Bacar]], who had led the separatist government since 2001, was elected for a five-year term as President of [[Anjouan]].  His term expired the 14 April 2007, and the president of the assembly, [[Houmadi Caambi]], became acting president from 15 April 2007 to 10 May 2007.  Citing irregularities and intimidation in the run-up to voting, the African Union (AU) and the Union government postponed the polls on Anjouan, but a defiant island president Mohamed Bacar printed his own ballots, held elections anyway and claimed a landslide victory of 90 percent on the 11th of May 2007.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2008/01/mil-080131-irin07.htm COMOROS: Military invasion of Anjouan imminent, government warns<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  

In October 2007, the African Union imposed travel sanctions on Anjouan's President Mohamed Bacar and other government officials and freezed their foreign assets while calling for fresh elections. Additionally, a naval blockade of the island was implemented.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1070770.stm BBC NEWS | Africa | Country profiles | Timeline: Comoros<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In February 2008, the Comoros rejected the [[African Union]]'s extended sanctions against Anjouan and instead opted for a military solution.  In March 2008 hundreds of Union government troops began assembling on Moheli, which is closer to Anjouan than the larger island Grande Comore. [[Sudan]] and [[Senegal]] were expected to provide a total of 750&nbsp;troops, while Libya has offered logistical support for the operation. In addition, 500&nbsp;Tanzanian troops were due to arrive soon after.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7289318.stm BBC NEWS | World | Africa | AU troops arrive in the Comoros<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.polity.org.za/article.php?a_id=129050 Comoros troops capture fighters on rebel island<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The forces invaded Anjouan on [[March 25]], [[2008]].

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of the African Union}}

The combined states of the African Union constitute the world's [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|17th largest economy]] with a [[Gross domestic product|nominal GDP]] of [[United States dollar|$]]500&nbsp;billion, ranking after the [[Netherlands]]. By measuring GDP by PPP, the African Union's economy totals $1.515&nbsp;trillion, ranking it 11th after [[Brazil]]. At the same time, they have a combined total debt of $200&nbsp;billion.

The AU future confederation's goals include the creation of a [[free trade area]], a [[customs union]], a [[single market]], a [[central bank]], and a [[Monetary union|common currency]], thereby establishing [[economic and monetary union]].  The current plan is to establish an [[African Economic Community]] with a single currency by [[2023]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/3870303.stm |title=

== Languages ==
{{main|Languages of the African Union}}
According to the Constitutive Act of the African Union, its working languages are [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], as well as [[Languages of Africa|African languages]] "if possible".<ref>Article 25, Constitutive Act of the African Union.</ref> A protocol amending the Constitutive Act adopted in 2003 but (as of 2007) not yet in force added [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]] and "any other African language" and termed all six "official" (rather than "working") languages of the African Union.<ref>Article 11, Protocol on Amendments to the Constitutive Act of the African Union</ref> In practice, translation of documents of the AU into even the four current working languages causes significant delays and difficulties to the conduct of business.

Founded in 2001, the [[African Academy of Languages]] promotes the usage and perpetuation of African languages amongst African people.

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of the African Union}}

Member [[state]]s of the African Union cover almost the entirety of continental [[Africa]] and several off-shore islands. Consequently, the geography of the African Union is wildly diverse, including the world's largest hot [[desert]] (the [[Sahara]]), huge [[jungle]]s and [[savanna]]s, and the world's longest river (the [[Nile]]).

The AU presently has an area of  29,922,059 [[square kilometre|km²]] (18,592,705 [[square mile|mi²]]), with 24,165 km² (15,015 mi²) of coastline. The vast majority of this area is on [[continent]]al Africa, while the only significant territory off the mainland is the island of [[Madagascar]] ([[List of islands by area|the world's fourth largest]]), accounting for slightly less than 2% of the total.

== Foreign relations ==
{{main|Foreign relations of the African Union}}

The individual member [[state]]s of the African Union coordinate foreign policy through this agency, in addition to conducting their own [[international relations]] on a state-by-state basis. The AU represents the interests of African peoples at large in [[intergovernmental organization]]s (IGO's); for instance, it is a [[United Nations General Assembly observers|permanent observer]] at the [[United Nations]]' [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]]. Both the African Union and the United Nations work in tandem to address issues of common concerns in various areas. The African Union Mission in United Nations aspires to serve as a bridge between the two Organizations.

Membership of the AU overlaps with other IGOs and occasionally these third-party organizations and the AU will coordinate matters of public policy. The African Union maintains special diplomatic representation with the [[Ambassadors from the United States|United States]] and the [[European Union Special Representative|European Union]].

== History of the African Union ==
{{main|History of the African Union}}

The historical foundations of the African Union originated in the [[Union of African States]], an early [[confederation]] that was established by [[Kwame Nkrumah]] in the 1960s, as well as subsequent attempts to unite Africa, including the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU), which was established on [[May 25]], [[1963]], and the [[African Economic Community]] in 1981. Critics argued that the OAU in particular did little to protect the rights and liberties of African citizens from their own political leaders, often dubbing it the "Dictators' Club".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2115736.stm African Union replaces dictators' club], BBC, 8 July 2002</ref>
                 
The idea of creating the AU was revived in the mid-1990s under the leadership of Libyan head of state [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]]: the heads of state and government of the OAU issued the [[Sirte Declaration]] (named after Sirte, in Libya) on [[September 9]], [[1999]], calling for the establishment of an African Union. The Declaration was followed by summits at [[Lomé]] in 2000, when the [[Constitutive Act of the African Union]] was adopted, and at [[Lusaka]] in 2001, when the plan for the implementation of the African Union was adopted. During the same period, the initiative for the establishment of the [[New Partnership for Africa's Development]] (NEPAD), was also established.

The African Union was launched in [[Durban]] on [[July 9]], [[2002]], by its first president, South African [[Thabo Mbeki]], at the first session of the Assembly of the African Union. The second session of the Assembly was in [[Maputo]] in 2003, and the third session in [[Addis Ababa]] on [[July 6]], [[2004]].

== Symbols ==
The [[emblem of the African Union]] consists of a [[gold]] ribbon bearing small interlocking [[red]] rings, from which palm leaves shoot up around an outer gold circle and an inner green circle, within which is a gold representation of Africa. The red interlinked rings stand for African solidarity and the blood shed for the liberation of Africa; the palm leaves, for peace; the gold, for Africa's wealth and bright future; the [[green]], for African hopes and aspirations. To symbolise African unity, the silhouette of Africa is drawn without internal borders.

The [[flag of the African Union]] bears a broad green horizontal stripe, a narrow band of gold, the emblem of the African Union at the centre of a broad white stripe, another narrow gold band and a final broad green stripe. Again, the green and gold symbolise Africa's hopes and aspirations as well as its wealth and bright future, and the white represents the purity of Africa's desire for friends throughout the world. The flag has led to the creation of the "[[national colours]]" of Africa of gold and green (sometimes together with white). These colours are visible in one way or another in the flags of many African nations. Together the colours green, gold, and red constitute the [[Pan-African colours]]. 

The African Union has adopted a new anthem, ''[[Let Us All Unite and Celebrate Together]]'', and has the chorus ''O sons and daughters of Africa, flesh of the sun and flesh of the sky, Let us make Africa the tree of life''.
