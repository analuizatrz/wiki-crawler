'''''Crime and Punishment''''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Преступление и наказание) is a [[novel]] by [[Russian literature|Russian author]] [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]] (or Dostoyevsky depending on the transliteration), that was first published in the literary journal ''[[The Russian Messenger]]'' in twelve monthly installments in 1866,<ref name="Minnesota Study Notes">[http://www1.umn.edu/lol-russ/hpgary/Russ3421/lesson9.htm University of Minnesota - Study notes for Crime and Punishment] - (retrieved on [[1 May]] [[2006]])</ref> and was later published in a single volume.<ref name="About">[http://classiclit.about.com/cs/toppicks/tp/aatp_crimepunsh.htm About: Crime and Punishment] - List of Top 10 editions of '''Crime and Punishment''' (retrieved on [[1 May]] [[2006]])</ref>

''Crime and Punishment'' focuses on the mental anguish and moral [[dilemma]]s of [[Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov]], an impoverished [[St. Petersburg]] ex-student who formulates and executes a plan to kill a hated, unscrupulous [[pawnbroker]] seemingly for her money, thereby solving his financial problems and at the same time, he argues, ridding the world of an evil worthless parasite. Raskolnikov also strives to be an extraordinary being, similar to [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], who can murder without repercussions.

==Background==
Dostoevsky conceived the idea of ''Crime and Punishment'' in the summer of 1865, having lost all his money at the casino, unable to pay his bill or afford proper meals. At the time the author owed large sums of money to creditors, and he was trying to help the family of his brother Mikhail, who had died in early 1864. The work was originally conceived in terms that suggest [[Émile Zola]]. Projected under the title ''The Drunkards'', it was to deal "with the present question of drunkness ... [in] all its ramifications, especially tbe picture of a family and the bringing up of children in these circumstance, etc., etc." Once Dostoevsky conceived Raskolnikov and his crime, this theme became auxiliary, centering on the story of the Marmeladov family.<ref>Yousef, [http://www.gradesaver.com/classicnotes/titles/crimeandpunishment/about.html About Crime and Punishment]<br/>* Peace (2005), 17&ndash;18</ref> 
{{Quote_box|width=40%|align=right|quote=<div style="text-align:left;">At the end of November much had been written and was ready; I burned it all; I can confess that now. I didn't like it myself. A new form, a new plan excited me, and I started all over again.</div>

Dostoevsky offered his story or novella (at the time Dostoevsky was not thinking of a novel<ref>Peace (2005), 8<br/>* Simmons (2007), 131</ref>) to the publisher [[Mikhail Katkov]], having explained to him that it was to be about a young man who yields to "certain strange, 'unfinished' ideas, floating in the air".<ref>Miller (2007), 58<br/>* Peace (2005), 8</ref> In letters written in November 1865 an important conceptual change occured: the "story" has become a "novel", and from here on all references to ''Crime and Punishment'' are to a novel. Having also decided to recast his novel in the third person, Dostoevsky began to rewrite from scratch, but was easily able to integrate sections of the early manuscript into the final text.<ref>Miller (2007), 58&ndash;59</ref> 

Dostoevsky had to race against time, in order to finish on time both ''[[The Gambler (novel)|The Gambler]]'' and ''Crime and Punishment''. Anna Snitkina, a stenographer who would soon become his second wife, was a great help for Dostoevsky during this difficult task.<ref>Frank (1995), 39<br/>* Peace (2005), 8</ref> The first part of ''Crime and Punishment'' appeared in the January 1866 issue of ''[[The Russian Messenger]]'', and the last one was published in December 1866.<ref>Simmons (2007), 131</ref>

==Plot summary==

The plot focuses on [[Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov]], a drop-out student, who chooses to live in a tiny, rented room in [[Saint Petersburg]]. Raskolnikov refuses all help, even from his friend Razumikhin, and plans to murder an old-woman money-lender, Alëna, and profit from her wealth&mdash;whether for personal or ideological motives is not quite clear. However, when Raskolnikov kills Alëna, he is also forced to kill her half-sister, Liza, who inopportunely comes in on the scene of the crime.

After the bungled murder Raskolnikov falls into a feverish state, and often behaves as though he wishes to betray himself, so that the detective Porfiry begins to suspect him purely on psychological grounds. At the same time, a chaste relationship develops between Raskolnikov and Sonya&mdash;a prostitute full of Christian virtue&mdash;and Raskolnikov confesses his crime to her. The confession is overheard by Svidrigaylov, a shadowy figure associated with vile deeds, whose aim is to seduce Raskolnikov's sister, Dunya. Svidrigaylov appears to have a hold over Raskolnikov, but when he unexpectedly commits suicide, Raskolnikov goes to police himself to confess. He is confessed to penal servitude in [[Siberia]]; Sonya follows him, and the Epilogue holds out hope for Raskolnikov's redemption, and moral regeneration under her influence.<ref>Peace (2005), 8&ndash;9</ref>

==Structure==
[[Image:Crimeandpunishment symmetry.jpg|right|250px|frame|The symmetry of ''Crime and Punishment'']]

''Crime and Punishment'' has a distinct beginning, middle and end. The novel is divided into six parts, with an [[epilogue]]. The notion of "intrinsic [[Dualism|duality]]" in ''Crime and Punishment'' has been commented upon, with the suggestion that there is a degree of [[symmetry]] to the book.<ref name="D162-163">Davydov (1982), 162&ndash;163</ref> [[Edward Wasiolek]] who has argued that Dostoevsky was a skilled craftsman, highly conscious of the formal pattern in his art, has likened the structure of ''Crime & Punishment'' to a "flattened X", saying:

{{blockquote|Parts I-III [of ''Crime and Punishment''] present the predominantly rational and proud Raskolnikov: Parts IV-VI, the emerging "irrational" and humble Raskolnikov. The first half of the novel shows the progressive death of the first ruling principle of his character; the last half, the progressive birth of the new ruling principle. The point of change comes in the very middle of the novel.<ref name="Edward Wasiolek">"On the Structure of Crime and Punishment, " in: PMLA, March 1959, vol. LXXIV, No. 1, p. 132&ndash;133.</ref>}} 

This compositional balance is achieved by means of the symmetrical distribution of certain key episodes throughout the novel's six parts. The recurrence of these episodes in the two halves of the novel, as [[David Bethea]] has argued, is organized according to a mirror-like principle, whereby the "left" half of the novel reflects the "right" half.<ref name="D162-163" /> For her part, Margaret Church discerns a [[contrapuntal]] structuring: parts I, III and V deal largely with the main hero's relationship to his family (mother, sister and mother surrogates), while parts II, IV and VI deal with his relationship to the authorities of the state "and to various father figures".<ref>Church (1983), 103</ref>

The seventh part of the novel, the Epilogue, has attracted much attention and controversy. Some of Dostoevsky's critics have criticized the novel's final pages as superfluous, anti-climactic, unworthy of the rest of the work, while others have rushed to the defense of the Epilogue, offering various ingenious schemes which conclusively prove its inevitability and necessity. Steven Cassedy argues that ''Crime and Punishment'' "is formally two distinct but closely related, things, namely a particular type of tragedy in the classical Greek mold and a Christian resurrection tale".<ref>Cassedy (1982), 171</ref> Cassedy concludes that "the logical demands of the tragic model as such are satisfied without the Epilogue in ''Crime and Punishment'' ... At the same time, this tragedy contains a Christian component, and the logical demands of this element are met only by the resurrection promised in the Epilogue".<ref>Cassedy (1982), 187</ref>

===Wordplay===

Dostoevsky wrote various instances of wordplay, or double meanings, into ''Crime and Punishment''. 

In the original Russian text, the names of the major characters in ''Crime and Punishment'' have something of a [[double meaning]]. However, these are not seen when translated to different languages.

<div align="center">
{| class="wikitable" align="center"

==Style==

''Crime and Punishment'' is written from a [[third-person narrative|third-person]] [[omniscient]] perspective. It is told primarily from the point of view of Raskolnikov; however, it does at times switch to the perspective of Svidrigailov, Razumikhin, Peter Petrovich, or Dunya. Dostoevski's noteboooks reveal that the writer began to write the novel in the first person.<ref>There is speculation about when Dostoevski actually made this shift from first to third person in the narration, though we do know that it occured sometimes during the late fall and early winter of 1865 (Miller [2007], 57)</ref> He actually considered four first-person plans: a memoir written by Raskolnikov, his confession recorded eight days after the murder, his diary begun five days after the murder, and a mixed form in which the first half was in the form of a memoir, and the second half in the form of a diary.<ref>Rosenshield (1973), 1973</ref>

==Characters in "Crime and Punishment"==
===Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov===

{{Main|Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov}}

[[Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov]], (Russian: Родион Романович Раскольников) variously called Rodya and Rodka, is the [[protagonist]] from whose perspective the story is primarily told. He was a student, but due to his abject poverty, had to leave the university. He resides in a small and squalid top-floor flat in the slums of Saint Petersburg. Despite the name of the novel it does not so much deal with his crime and its formal punishment as with Raskolnikov's internal struggle. In the main, his punishment results more from his conscience than from the law. He commits the murder in the belief that he possesses enough intellectual and emotional fortitude to deal with a murder [based on his paper/thesis, "On Crime"], that he is a [[Napoleon]], but his paranoia and guilt soon engulf him. It is only in the epilogue that his formal punishment is realized, having decided to confess and end his alienation. His name derives from the Russian word ''raskolnik'', meaning “schismatic” or “divided,” an allusion to Raskolnikov's self-imposed schism from Russian society, as well as his own split personality and constantly changing emotional state.

===Sonia Semyonovna Marmeladova===
Sofia Semyonovna Marmeladova (Russian: Софья Семёновна Мармеладова), variously called Sonia and Sonechka, is the daughter of a drunk, Semyon Zakharovich Marmeladov, whom Raskolnikov meets in a tavern at the beginning of the novel. It is not until Semyon's death, and Sonia's thanks for Raskolnikov's generosity, that the two characters meet. She has been driven into prostitution by the habits of her father, but she is still deeply religious. Rodion finds himself drawn to her to such an extent, that she becomes the first person to whom he confesses his crime. She supports him even though she was friends with one of the victims (Lizaveta). For most of the novel, Sonia serves as the spiritual guide for Raskolnikov; she encourages him to take up faith and confess. He does, and after his confession she follows him to Siberia where she lives in the same town as the prison; it is here that Raskolnikov begins his spiritual rebirth.

===Other characters===

*'''Porfiry Petrovich''' (Порфирий Петрович) - The [[detective]] in charge of solving Raskolnikov's murders who, along with Sonya, guides Raskolnikov towards confession. Unlike Sonya, however, Petrovich does this through detrimental mind games, contributing to Raskolnikov's mental instability.  Despite the lack of evidence he becomes certain Raskolnikov is the murderer following several conversations with him, but gives Raskolnikov the chance to confess voluntarily. He is very interested in the psychology behind the motives of criminals. After the heinous double murder, Raskolnikov is terribly disturbed by bouts of illness and fainting, his recurrent nightmares, the smell of fresh paint (painters were working in the pawnbroker's building when he killed her), and the memory of the blood-spattered crime scene. Porfiry attempts to confuse and provoke the unstable Raskolnikov in an attempt to coerce him to confess. Porfiry's piercing eyes, along with his absurd body language and rapier accusations, help drive Raskolnikov to his confession. 
*'''Avdotya Romanovna Raskolnikova''' (Авдотья Романовна Раскольникова) - Raskolnikov's strong willed and self-sacrificing sister, called Dunya, Dounia or Dunechka for short. She initially plans to marry the wealthy, yet somewhat smug and self-possessed, Luzhin to save the family from financial destitution but is followed to Saint Petersburg by the disturbed Svidrigailov, who seeks to win her back through blackmail. She rejects both men in favour of Raskolnikov's loyal friend, Razumikhin.
*'''Arkady Ivanovich Svidrigailov''' (Аркадий Иванович Свидригайлов) - Sensual, depraved, and wealthy former employer and current pursuer of Dunya, Svidrigailov is suspected of multiple acts of murder, and overhears Raskolnikov's confessions to Sonya. With this knowledge he torments both Dunya and Raskolnikov but does not inform the police. When Dunya tells him she could never love him (after attempting to shoot him) he lets her go and commits [[suicide]]. Whereas Sonya represents the path to salvation, Svidrigailov represents the other path towards suicide. Despite his apparent malevolence, Svidrigailov is similar to Raskolnikov in regard to his random acts of charity. He fronts the money for the Marmeladov children to enter an [[orphanage]] (after both their parents die),gives Sonya five percent bank notes totalling three thousand rubles,leaves the rest of his money to his juvenile [[Engagement|fiancée]].
*'''Marfa Petrovna Svidrigailova''' (Марфа Петровна Свидригайлова) - Arkady Svidrigailov's deceased wife, whom he is suspected of having murdered, and who he claims has visited him as a ghost. Her bequest of 3,000 rubles to Dunya allows Dunya to decisively reject Luzhin as a suitor.
*'''Dmitri Prokofich Razumikhin''' (Дмитрий Прокофьич Разумихин) - Raskolnikov's [[loyalty|loyal]], good-natured (though occasionally hot-tempered) and only friend. Raskolnikov repeatedly entrusts the care of his family over to Razumikhin, who lives up to his word. He and Dunya ultimately fall in love and marry. In terms of Razumikhin's contribution to Dostoyevsky's anti-radical thematics, he is intended to represent something of a reconciliation of the pervasive thematic conflict between faith and reason. The fact that his name ''means'' reason shows Dostoyevsky's desire to employ this faculty as a foundational basis for his Christian faith in God. 
*'''Katerina Ivanovna Marmeladova''' (Катерина Ивановна Мармеладова) - Semyon Marmeladov's [[Tuberculosis|consumptive]] and  ill-tempered second wife, stepmother to Sonya. She drives Sonya into prostitution in a fit of rage, but later regrets it, and beats her children mercilessly, but works ferociously to improve their standard of living. She is obsessed with demonstrating that slum life is far below her station, exaggerating her father's influence and insisting that she be treated as "genteel, one might say aristocratic." Following Marmeladov's death, she uses Raskolnikov's money to hold a funeral. At the funeral dinner, she gets in a fight with the other boarders in her building and suffers a coughing fit, throwing up litres of blood, and dying shortly after.
*'''Semyon Zakharovich Marmeladov''' (Семён Захарович Мармеладов) - Hopeless but amiable [[Drunkenness|drunk]] who indulges in his own suffering, and father of Sonya. In the bar he informs Raskolnikov of his familial situation and how he feels incapable of helping them. Marmeladov is run over by a carriage and killed, but this may have been a suicide.  Raskolnikov identifies the man's body in the street and, despite of the fear and panic presented from the blood in murder, he holds him in the street, getting blood on himself; Raskolnikov donates all of his money (which was obtained by his mother as a loan for her pension and sent to Raskolnikov just prior to her arrival to Petersburg) to Marmeladov's family to help with funerary expenses. Marmeladov could be seen as a Russian equivalent of the character of [[Wilkins Micawber|Micawber]] in [[Charles Dickens]]' novel, ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]''.
*'''Pulkheria Alexandrovna Raskolnikova''' (Пульхерия Александровна Раскольникова) - Raskolnikov's relatively clueless, hopeful and loving mother. She informs him of his sister's plans to marry Luzhin. Following Raskolnikov's sentence, she falls ill (mentally and physically) and eventually dies. She hints in her dying stages that she is slightly more aware of her son's fate, which was hidden from her by Dunya and Razumikhin.
*'''Pyotr Petrovich Luzhin''' (Пётр Петрович Лужин) - Despicable man who wants to marry Dunya so she'll be completely subservient to him. Raskolnikov does not take kindly to him and Luzhin is embittered, eventually growing to hate Raskolnikov. To exact his revenge, he attempts to frame Sonya for theft, but the plot is uncovered by Lebezyatnikov and he leaves Saint Petersburg in shame.
*'''Andrey Semyenovich Lebezyatnikov''' (Андрей Семёнович Лебезятников) - Luzhin's [[utopian socialism|utopian socialist]] roommate who witnesses his attempt to frame Sonya and subsequently exposes him.
*'''Alyona Ivanovna''' (Алёна Ивановна) - Suspicious old pawnbroker who hoards money and is merciless to her patrons. She is Raskolnikov's intended target for murder.
*'''Lizaveta Ivanovna''' (Лизавета Ивановна) - Alyona's simple and innocent sister who arrives during the murder, and is subsequently killed. She was a friend of Sonya's. Is noted to be 'constantly pregnant', yet no mention is made of her children.
*'''Zosimov''' (Зосимов) - A friend of Razumikhin and a doctor who cared for Raskolnikov.
*'''Nastasya Petrovna''' (Настасья Петровна) - Raskolnikov's landlady's servant and a friend of Raskolnikov.
*'''Nikodim Fomich''' (Никодим Фомич)- The amiable Chief of Police.
*'''Ilya Petrovich''' (Илья Петрович) - A police official and Fomich's assistant, often referred to as "Lieutenant Gunpowder" or "Explosive Lieutenant" in regards to his short temper. He is also the officer deliberately chosen by Raskolnikov to confess to. 
*'''Alexander Grigorievich Zamyotov''' (Александр Григорьевич Заметов) - Corrupt head clerk at the police station and friend to Razumikhin. Raskolnikov arouses Zametov's suspicions by explaining how he, Raskolnikov, would have committed various crimes, although Zametov later apologizes, believing, much to Raskolnikov's amusement, that it was all a farce to expose how ridiculous the suspicions were. This scene illustrates the argument of Raskolnikov's belief in his own superiority as ''[[Übermensch]]''. 
*'''Nikolai Dementiev''' (Николай Дементьев) - A painter and sectarian who admits to the murder, since his sect holds it to be supremely virtuous to suffer for another person's crime.
*'''Polina Mikhailovna Marmeladova''' (Полина Михайловна Мармеладова) - Ten-year-old adopted daughter of Semyon Zakharovich Marmeladov and younger stepsister to Sonya, sometimes known as Polenka.

==Symbols==
===The Dreams===
Rodya's dreams always have a symbolic meaning, which suggests a psychological view. In the dream about the horse, the mare has to sacrifice itself for the men who are too much in a rush to wait. This could be symbolic of women sacrificing themselves for men, just like Rodya's belief that Dunya is sacrificing herself for Rodya by marrying Luzhin.  Some critics have suggested this dream is the fullest single expression of the whole novel,<ref name="Sidney Monas">Monas, Sidney, "Afterword: The Dream of the Suffering Horse," from his translation</ref> containing the nihilistic destruction of an innocent creature and Rodion's suppressed sympathy for it (although the young Rodion in the dream runs to the horse, he still murders the pawnbroker soon after waking).
The dream is also mentioned when Rodya talks to Marmeladov. He states that his daughter, Sonya, has to sell her body to earn a living for their family. The dream is also a blatant warning for the impending murder.

In the final pages, Raskolnikov, who at this point is in the prison infirmary, has a feverish dream about a plague of [[nihilism]], that enters Russia and Europe from the east and which spreads senseless dissent (Raskolnikov's name alludes to "raskol", dissent) and fanatic dedication to "new ideas": it finally engulfs all of mankind. Though we don't learn anything about the content of these ideas they clearly disrupt society forever and are seen as exclusively critical assaults on ordinary thinking: it is clear that Dostoevsky was envisaging the new, ''politically'' and culturally nihilist ideas which were entering Russian literature and society in this watershed decade, and with which Dostoevsky would be in debate for the rest of his life (cp. Chernyshevsky's ''[[What Is to Be Done? (novel)|What Is to Be Done?]]'', [[Nikolay Dobrolyubov|Dobrolyubov]]'s abrasive journalism, [[Ivan Turgenev|Turgenev]]'s ''[[Fathers and Sons]]'' and Dostoesvsky's own ''[[The Possessed (novel)|The Possessed]]''). Just like the novel demonstrates and argues Dostoevsky's conviction that "if God doesn't exist (or is not recognized) then anything is permissible" the dream sums up his fear that if men won't check their thinking against the realities of life and nature, and if they are unwilling to listen to reason or authority, then no ideas or cultural institutions will last and only brute barbarism can be the result. [[Janko Lavrin]], who took part in the revolutions of the WWI era, knew [[Lenin]] and [[Trotsky]] and many others, and later would spend years writing and researching on Dostoevsky and other Russian classics, called this final dream "prophetic in its symbolism".

===The Cross===
Sonya gives Rodya a [[cross]] when he goes to turn himself in. He takes his pain upon him by carrying the cross through town, like [[Jesus]]; he falls to his knees in the town square on the way to his confession. Sonya carried the cross up until then, which indicates that, as literally mentioned in the book, she suffers for him, in a semi-Christ-like manner. Sonya and Lizaveta had exchanged crosses and become spiritual sisters, originally the cross was Lizaveta's - so Sonya carries Lizaveta's cross, the cross of Rodya's innocent victim, whom he didn't intend to kill. Rodya sees that the cross is made of [[cypress]].

===Saint Petersburg===
This could be a symbol for Rodya's mind or his mental state. It is very confusing, dirty and disgusting. Even Rodya gets disgusted by the sight of it. The city is filled with prostitutes, symbolizing its utter social decadence.  Sidney Monas likened its appearance to imagery found in [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Waste Land]]'',<ref name="Sidney Monas">Monas, Sidney, "Afterword: The Dream of the Suffering Horse," from his translation</ref> another example of its grotesque demeanor.  Indeed, the city plays such an important part in the novel that it is almost a character in itself.

Many of the characters in the novel might be said to be symbolic doubles of Raskolnikov: they share some of his personal traits or something in his situation: his pride and sense of ambition (Dunya), his ongoing moral dilapidation (Svidrigailov), the threat of sinking into destitution and going under (Marmeladov), the loyalty to one's family (Sonya; this feeling is undermined in him by the crime, but the opening scene when Rodion reads the letter from home makes it clear that the bond between him and his mother and, in particular, his sister, has always been a strong one, and Dunya is, after Sonya, the second person to whom he confesses his crime).
