==Background==
''Avatar: The Last Airbender'' was co-created and produced by [[Michael Dante DiMartino]] and [[Bryan Konietzko]] at Nickelodeon Animation Studios in [[Burbank, California]]. According to Bryan Konietzko, the concept of the program was conceived in Spring 2001, when he took an old sketch of a balding, middle-aged man; he re-imagined the character as a child, and the show began to develop.<ref name="NickMagInterview1" /> Bryan drew the character herding bison in the sky, and showed the sketch to Mike DiMartino. At the time, Michael was studying a documentary about explorers trapped in the [[South Pole]]. 

Konietzko described their early development of the concept: {{cquote|We thought, "There's an air guy along with these water people trapped in a snowy wasteland... and maybe some fire people are pressing down on them..."|Bryan Konietzko<ref name="NickMagInterview1">{{cite journal|last=DiMartino|first=Michael Dante|coauthors=Konietzko, Bryan|title=In Their Elements|journal=Nickelodeon Magazine|pages=6|year=2006|issue=Winter 2006}}</ref> }}The co-creators proceeded to successfully pitch the idea to Nickelodeon [[VP]] and [[executive producer]] Eric Coleman just two weeks later.<ref name="AWN1">{{cite web|url=http://mag.awn.com/index.php?ltype=pageone&article_no=3428|title=It's Elementary -- Avatar: The Last Airbender|last=Clark|first=Craig J.|date=2007-10-17|publisher=Animation World Magazine, Inc.|accessdate=2008-05-03}}</ref>

The show was first revealed to the public in a teaser reel at [[Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]] 2004,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.nick.com/all_nick/tv_supersites/video.jhtml?show_id=ava&clip=16 | title = Avatar: The Last Airbender Sneak Peak|accessdate = 2006-12-10|publisher = Nickelodeon}}</ref> and aired February 21, 2005. In the United States, the first two episodes of the series were shown together in a one-hour premiere event. At the conclusion of the first season, Nickelodeon ordered a second twenty-episode season that premiered on March 17, 2006, and concluded on December 1.<ref name="secondseason"/> The series maintained its success during the second season, causing Nickelodeon to order a third and final season, which began on September 21, 2007 and featured twenty-one episodes rather than the usual twenty.<ref name="as_S3airdate" /> The final four episodes were packaged as a two-hour movie.

===Premise===
[[Image:Avatar world map.jpg|left|thumb|250px|A map of the four nations. The characters at the top, 群雄四分, mean "the heroes divide [the world or the country or the land] in four." The characters of the four lands are 水善 (Water Peaceful), 土強 (Earth Strong), 火烈 (Fire Fierce), and 气和 (Air Harmony). The phrase at the bottom, 天下一匡, reads "correct [[all under heaven|all things under heaven]]." The "correct things" phrase, with roots of the Confucian analect phrase 一匡天下, refers to reunification.{{Fact|date=July 2008}}]]
''Avatar: The Last Airbender'' takes place in a fantasy world that is home to humans, fantastic animals, and supernatural spirits. Human civilization is divided into four nations: the [[Water Tribe]]s, the [[Earth Kingdom]], the [[Air Nomads]], and the [[Fire Nation]]. Each nation has its own natural element, on which it bases its society. Within each nation exists an order called "Benders," who have the ability to manipulate the [[classical element|element]] of their nation. The show’s creators assigned each Bending art its own style of martial arts; inheriting both the advantages and weakness of the martial arts it was assigned. The Bending types are [[Waterbender|Waterbending]], [[Earthbender|Earthbending]], [[Firebender|Firebending]], and [[Airbender|Airbending]].<ref name="avatar2/index.jhtml">{{cite web | url = http://www.nick.com/shows/avatar/index.jhtml | title = Nickelodeon's Official Avatar: The Last Airbender Flash Site | accessdate = 2006-12-02 | publisher = Nick.com}}</ref>

Each generation yields one person who is capable of Bending all four elements. This being is referred to as the Avatar, the spirit of the planet manifested in human form. When an Avatar dies, he is [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] into the next nation in the Avatar Cycle. The Avatar Cycle parallels the seasons: autumn for the Air Nomads, winter for the Water Tribe, spring for the Earth Kingdom and summer for the Fire Nation.<ref name="The Souther Air Temple">{{cite episode|title=The Southern Air Temple|url=|airdate=2005-02-25|season=1|number=3|transcripturl=|credits=Director: Lauren MacMullan; Writer: Michael Dante DiMartino|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref> Legend holds the Avatar must master each bending art in order, starting with his native element.  This can sometimes be compromised when the situation requires it, as Aang demonstrates in the show. For the Avatar, learning to bend the element opposite his native element can be extremely difficult.  This is because opposing Bending arts are based on opposing fighting styles and disciplines.  [[Firebending]] and [[Waterbending]] are opposites, as are [[Earthbending]] and [[Airbending]].<ref name="LearnEarthbending">{{cite episode | title = Bitter Work | series = Avatar: The Last Airbender| network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2006-06-02 | season = 2 (Book 2) | number = 9}}</ref>

The Avatar possesses a unique power called the Avatar State. It endows the Avatar with the knowledge and abilities of all past Avatars and acts as an self-triggering [[defense mechanism]], though by learning how to unlock one's own [[chakra]]s, it can be entered into at will.<ref name="AvatarState" />  If an Avatar is killed in the Avatar State, the reincarnation cycle will be broken, and the Avatar will cease to exist.<ref name="AvatarState">{{cite episode | title = The Avatar State | series = Avatar: The Last Airbender | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2006-03-17 | season = 2 (Book 2) | number = 1}}</ref>

Through the ages, countless incarnations of Avatar have served to keep the four nations in harmony, and maintain world order.<ref name="avatar2/index.jhtml"/> The Avatar serves as the bridge between the physical world and the [[Spirit World (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|Spirit World]], allowing him or her to solve problems that normal benders cannot.<ref name="SpiritWorld">{{cite episode | title = The Spirit World | series = Avatar: The Last Airbender | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2005-04-08 | season = 1 (Book 1) | number = 7}}</ref>

===Plot summary===
{{main article|List of Avatar: The Last Airbender episodes}}
One hundred years before the start of the series, the Airbender [[Aang]] learned he was the new Avatar. Faced with the heavy responsibilities of stopping an impending world war, Aang fled from home on his flying bison [[Appa]].  Encountering a fierce storm, they crashed into the ocean, triggering Aang's Avatar State, which froze them in a state of [[suspended animation]].

They are awoken when two siblings of [[Water Tribe|Southern Water Tribe]], [[Katara]] and [[Sokka]], find them.<ref name="The Boy In The Iceberg">{{cite episode|title=The Boy in the Iceberg|url=|airdate=2005-02-21|season=1|number=1|transcripturl=|credits=Director: Dave Filoni; Writers: Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref> Aang learns that the [[Fire Nation]] had indeed ravaged the world with decades of war, he realizes that he must fulfill his destiny of becoming the Avatar and return balance to the world by defeating the Fire Nation. Along with Katara and Sokka, Aang sets out to master the four elements of Air, Water, Earth and Fire (in that order); as he is already an Airbender, he heads to the North Pole to find a Waterbending master.

Aang soon discovers that Sozin's Comet, which sparked off the war, will return within a year, giving the Fire Nation enough power to win the war for good.  Aang must therefore master all the elements and as the Avatar, end the war before then.  For most of their journey to the North Pole, the group is pursued by [[Zuko]] (along with his uncle [[Iroh]]) - banished [[Fire Nation]] prince and son of [[List of Avatar: The Last Airbender characters#Major secondary characters|Fire Lord Ozai]], obsessed with capturing Aang to restore his lost honor.

Aang travels to the Earth Kingdom to master Earthbending. The team meets [[Toph]], a blind girl who is nevertheless an Earthbending prodigy and becomes Aang's second teacher.  The heroes go on to discover information about a solar eclipse, which would leave the Fire Nation powerless and open to invasion; they struggle to reach the Earth King with this vital information.  Opposing them are enemies old and new: the conflicted Zuko, his sister [[Azula]] and her two friends [[List of Avatar: The Last Airbender characters#Major secondary characters|Mai]] and [[List of Avatar: The Last Airbender characters#Major secondary characters|Ty Lee]].  Azula engineers a coup from within that topples the Earth Kingdom and destroys any hope of a large-scale invasion of the Fire Nation.

On the day of the eclipse, Aang, Sokka, Katara, Toph and a small, determined group of allied warriors go ahead and launch a smaller invasion, which although brave ultimately fails thanks to Azula's cunning.  Zuko finally learns the true side of himself and confronts his father.  He later manages to gain the trust of the protagonists and becomes Aang's Firebending teacher.

Sozin's Comet arrives and Fire Lord Ozai is on the brink of total victory in the war.  Now, having finally mastered all four elements, Aang and his friends face Fire Lord Ozai and defeat him, finally restoring harmony to the world.

==Characters==
{{main|List of Avatar: The Last Airbender characters}}

*'''[[Aang]]''' ([[Zach Tyler Eisen]]) is the fun-loving, 112-year-old [[protagonist]] of the series. He is biologically 12 years old but was frozen in an iceberg for 100 years. He is the current incarnation of the Avatar, the spirit of the planet in human form. Aang is a reluctant hero and would prefer adventure over his job as the Avatar and making friends over fighting the Fire Nation. 

*'''[[Katara]]''' ([[Mae Whitman]]) is a 14-year-old<ref name="avatar2/index.jhtml" /> Waterbender of the Southern Water Tribe. In the opening of the show, Katara discovers and frees Aang from an iceberg which he was trapped in for one hundred years. With her older brother Sokka, she accompanies Aang on his quest to defeat the Fire Lord, and bring peace to the world. In season 3, she reluctantly learns the rare art of blood bending (using the water in another's bloodstream to control their movement). In the original unaired [[pilot episode]], Katara's name was Kya.

*'''[[Sokka]]''' ([[Jack DeSena]]) is a 15-year-old warrior of the Southern Water Tribe. With his sister Katara, he accompanies Aang on his quest to defeat the Fire Lord. The joker of the group, Sokka describes himself as "meat-loving" and "sarcastic".<ref name="LearnEarthbending"/> Unlike his companions, Sokka cannot bend an element, but the series frequently grants him opportunities to use his true gifts: ingenuity and use of weapons, including his trusty boomerang and a sword he forged from a meteorite after training under the greatest swordsmaster in the Fire Nation.

*'''[[Toph|Toph Bei Fong]]''' ([[Jessie Flower]]) is a 12-year-old,<ref name="avatar2/index.jhtml" /> blind Earthbender. In the second season of the show, she leaves her wealthy family and home to join Aang on his quest, with a plan to teach him earthbending. Though blind, Toph "sees" with Earthbending; she feels the vibrations in the ground through her feet. After being captured by two Earthbenders, she learns to bend metal, as it is merely purified Earth.

*'''[[Zuko]]''' ([[Dante Basco]]) is the 16-year-old exiled prince of the Fire Nation and original [[antagonist]] of the series. In Book One, Zuko is obsessed with capturing the Avatar. Due to events in Zuko's past, his father, Fire Lord Ozai, deems him a complete failure. Over time, Zuko struggles to deal with his anger, self-pity, and familial relationships; meanwhile, he grows sympathetic to the peoples his nation has terrorized. In Book Three, he defects from his father and the Fire Nation, and joins Aang and the team in order to teach Aang Firebending. At the end of the series he is crowned Fire Lord of the Fire Nation. 

*'''[[Azula]]''' ([[Grey DeLisle]]) is the 14-year-old<ref name="avatar2/index.jhtml" /> princess of the Fire Nation. She is Zuko's younger sister and is one of the major [[antagonist]]s of the series. Azula is considered a firebending prodigy, and is one of the few living firebenders capable of summoning lightning, as well as the only shown to bend a hotter, blue fire. She has no qualms about bullying and threatening her relatives, reserving any familial loyalty for her father, who greatly favors her over Zuko.  

*'''[[Iroh]]''' ([[Mako (actor)|Mako]] in Books 1 and 2, [[Greg Baldwin]]&nbsp;onwards) is a retired Fire Nation general and Prince Zuko's uncle and mentor. Being the older brother of Fire Lord Ozai, Iroh was the original [[heir apparent|heir to the Fire Nation throne]].<ref name="ZukoAlone">{{cite episode | title = Zuko Alone | series = Avatar: The Last Airbender | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2006-05-12 | season = 2 (Book 2) | number = 7}}</ref> On the surface, Iroh is a cheerful and kind old man, but underneath his exterior remains a competent warrior and a devoted surrogate parent to Zuko, especially after losing his only child in battle. He is a Grand Master of the Order of the White Lotus, a secret society of men from all nations, and helped in the retaking of Ba Sing Se during Sozin's Comet.

==Influences==
===Cultural references===
''Avatar'' is notable for borrowing extensively from [[Art of East Asia|Asian art]] and mythology to create its [[fictional universe]]. The show's character designs are heavily influenced by [[anime]]; the show, however, is not considered an "anime" because of its origination in the United States. Explicitly stated influences include [[Chinese art]] and [[History of China|history]], [[Japanese anime]], [[Hinduism]] (India), [[Taoism]] (China), [[Buddhism]] (India),<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nicksplat.com/Whatsup/200510/12000135.html | title = Interview With The Creators | accessdate = 2006-12-02|date=2005-10-12 | publisher = NickSplat.com}}</ref> and [[Yoga]] (India).<ref name="nytimes">{{cite web | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/28/arts/television/28lass.html?ei=5090&en=2d9845c5b0133bb9&ex=1282881600&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=all | title = Article On Avatar: The Last Airbender | accessdate = 2006-12-02 | author = Mark Lasswell |date=2005-08-25 | publisher = NY Times}}</ref> The production staff employs a cultural consultant, Edwin Zane, to review scripts.

====Avatar====
The term "[[Avatar]]" comes from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''Avatāra'', ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]: {{lang|sa|अवतार}}), which means "incarnation." In [[Hindu mythology]], gods manifest themselves into Avatars to restore balance on earth, usually after a period of great evil. The [[Chinese character]]s that appear at the top of the show's title card mean "the divine medium who has descended upon the mortal world."<ref name="calligraphy.html">{{cite web | url = http://www.musogato.com/avatar/calligraphy.html | title = Calligraphy Writing In Avatar | accessdate = 2006-12-02 | author = KTChong | publisher = Distant Horizon}}</ref>

When [[Aang]] was a child, he unknowingly revealed that he was the Avatar; he chose four toys out of thousands, each of which were toys of the previous Avatars (among other trials. In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], there is a similar test for reincarnations of a [[Tulku]] [[Lama]]. According to the book ''Magic and Mystery in Tibet'' by [[Alexandra David-Neel]], "a number of objects such as [[rosary|rosaries]], ritualistic implements, books, tea-cups, etc., are placed together, and the child must pick out those which belonged to the late ''tulku'', thus showing that he recognizes the things which were ''theirs'' in their previous life."<ref>David-Neel, Alexandra. ''Magic and Mystery in Tibet''. New York: Dover Publications, Inc., 1971 (ISBN 0-486-22682-4)</ref> The show's official site states "the successor is expected to show signs of continuity with the previous Avatar, such as being born within a week of the death."<ref name="avatar2/index.jhtml"/>

====Elements====
<!-- Do not mention any specific classical ideology as the influential source unless you have verifiable proof. No "missing fifth element."-->
''Avatar'' draws on the four [[classical elements]] common to most [[Ancient philosophy|ancient philosophies]] (rather than the five [[Wu Xing|classical Chinese elements]]) for its bending arts: [[Water (classical element)|Water]], [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]] and [[Air (classical element)|Air]]. Although each has its own variation, most ancient philosophies incorporate these four elements in some way: examples include the classical [[Tattva|Hindu]], [[Mahābhūta|Buddhist]], [[Classical elements#Classical elements in Greece|Greek]] and [[Five elements (Japanese philosophy)|Japanese]] elemental traditions.
<!-- Please do not mention the 4 Classical Chinese Elements. We KNOW, they're different. Several other philosophies are too. None of them, and neither the Chinese elements, are used in the show, so mentioning any of them is of NO importance. Except to provide relevant information and greater understanding of Chinese culture.-->

In the show’s opening, each element is accompanied by 2 Chinese characters: an ancient Chinese [[seal script]] character on the left, and a modern Chinese character on the right:
* [[Water (classical element)|Water]] ({{lang|zh|水}}) is associated with "[[Image:Shan.svg|20px]]" ({{zh-cp|c=善|p=shàn}}), which means "benevolent" or "adaptive."
* [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]] ({{lang|zh|土}}) is associated with "[[Image:Qiang.svg|20px]]" ({{zh-tsp|t=強|s=强|p=qiáng}}), which means "strong."
* [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]] ({{lang|zh|火}}) is associated with "[[Image:Lie.svg|20px]]" ({{zh-cp|c=烈|p=liè}}), which means "intense" or "ferocious."
* [[Air (classical element)|Air]] ({{lang|zh|气}}) is associated with "[[Image:He (character).svg|20px]]" ({{zh-cp|c=和|p=hé}}), which means "peaceful" or "harmonious".<ref name="cally">{{cite web | url = http://www.musogato.com/avatar/calligraphy.html | title = Distant Horizon: Avatar Calligraphy | accessdate = 2006-12-09 }}</ref>
<!-- Please do not re-add information about Plantbending and Metalbending, in both cases it was specifically mentioned that the bender was not bending either the plant or the metal, but simply the water and the earth within them. -->

===Western culture===
Film series such as ''[[Star Wars]]'', as well as book series such as ''[[Harry Potter]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', were a heavy influence when it came to developing the story of ''Avatar''.  The creators wanted to tell their own epic Legend & Lore story.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://tv.ign.com/articles/818/818284p1.html | title = IGN: Interview: Avatar's Bryan Konietzko and Michael Dante DiMartino | accessdate = 2007-09-24|date=2007-09-06 | publisher = IGN.com}}</ref>

===Asian culture===
====Calligraphy====
<!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:ATLA Calligraphy.png|thumb|An example of Chinese calligraphy]] -->
Traditional [[East Asian calligraphy]] styles are used for nearly all the writing in the show. For each instance of calligraphy, an appropriate style is used, ranging from [[seal script]] (more archaic) to [[clerical script]].<ref name="calligraphy.html"/> The show employs calligrapher Siu-Leung Lee as a consultant and translator.<ref name="nytimes"/>

====Fighting styles====
The fighting choreography of the show draws from martial arts; the fighting styles and weaponry are based on [[Chinese martial arts]], with each bending art corresponding to a certain real-world style. The creators use [[Ba Gua Zhang|Ba Gua]] for [[Airbender|airbending]], [[Hung Gar]] for [[Earthbender|earthbending]], [[Northern Shaolin]] for [[Firebender|firebending]], and  [[Tai Chi Chuan|Tai Chi]] for [[Waterbender|waterbending]].<ref name="avatar2/index.jhtml"/> The only exception to this is [[Toph]], who employs a Chu Gar [[Southern Praying Mantis (martial art)|Southern Praying Mantis]] style.<ref name="con">{{cite web|url=http://flaming-june.org/videos/Audience%20Question%20&%20Answer%20Pt.%202.wmv|title=Audience Questions and Answer Part 2 at the San Diego Comi-con 2006|publisher=Flaming June|accessdate=2008-05-07|type=WMV}}</ref> The show employs [[Sifu]] Kisu of the Harmonious Fist Chinese Athletic Association as a martial arts consultant.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.harmoniousfist.com/ | title = The National Shaolin Information Resource | accessdate = 2006-12-02 | publisher = The Harmonious Fist Chinese Athletic Association}}</ref>

Each fighting style was chosen to represent the element it projected:
* [[Tai Chi Chuan|Tai Chi]] focuses on alignment, body structure, breath, and visualization. This technique is the foundation of "Waterbending" in the series.<ref name="avatar2/index.jhtml"/>
* [[Hung Gar]] was chosen for its firmly rooted stances and powerful strikes to represent the solid nature of earth. This martial art is the basis of "Earthbending" in the series.<ref name="avatar2/index.jhtml"/>
** [[Chu Gar]] [[Southern Praying Mantis]] has distinguishing movements and unique footwork that are employed by [[Toph Bei Fong]] to complement her blindness, giving her a unique style of Earthbending.<ref name="con"/>
* [[Northern Shaolin]] Kung Fu uses strong arm and leg movements. This technique is the foundation of "Firebending" in the series.<ref name="avatar2/index.jhtml"/>
* [[Ba Gua Zhang|Ba Gua]] uses erratic, circular movements.<ref name="avatar2/index.jhtml"/> In Bagua, [[centrifugal force]] plays a vital role in generating power, and the nearly constant circular movement creates angles between the fighters. This makes it easier for the practitioner to defend and attack. This martial art is the basis of "Airbending" and is the bending style of the main character, Aang.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pa-kua.com/fyi27/fyib27.htm|title=Advanced Circle Walking: Training to Fight|last=Miller|first=Dan|year=1994|work=Pa Kua Chang Journal|publisher=The Ba Gua Zhang (Pa Kua Chang) Website of Sifu Park Bok-Nam|accessdate=2008-05-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shenwu.com/bagua.htm|title=An Introduction to Ba Gua Zhang|last=Cartmell|first=Tim|publisher=Shen Wu Martial Arts|accessdate=2008-05-07}}</ref>

====Asian film====
The choreographed martial art bending moves were profoundly affected by Asian cinema. ''Avatar'' creators Bryan Konietzko and Michael Dante DiMartino stated the particular influence in a magazine interview:
{{quote|"Asian cinema is really good at action comedy. ''[[Shaolin Soccer]]'' is one of our favorite movies. It has tons of fantastic action and lots of funny moments. Some of the effects provided inspiration for how bending moves might look on the show."<ref name="NickMagInterview1" />}}

====Anime====

''Avatar'' is not considered an [[anime]] because of its American origin; one review has commented that "''Avatar'' blurs the line between anime and (US) domestic cartoons until it becomes irrelevant."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/anime/sfw12366.html|title=SciFi Channel Anime Review|accessdate=2006-10-16|work=SciFi}}</ref> Avatar has many features of anime, such as having a different color palette from other animated shows.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.awn.com/index.php?ltype=top&newsitem_no=13156 | title = Avatar: The Last Airbender Article | accessdate = 2006-12-16 |date=2005-02-18 | publisher = Animation World Magazine}}</ref>

''Avatar'' creators Bryan Konietzko and Michael Dante DiMartino confirmed a particular anime influence in a magazine interview:
{{quote|The best anime balances great action sequences with humor and emotion, something we try to do on ''Avatar''. We love all the films of [[Hayao Miyazaki]], especially ''[[Spirited Away]]'' and ''[[Princess Mononoke]]''. Both movies deal with spirituality and the environment in an entertaining way. Also, there's a lot of great animation."<ref name="NickMagInterview1" />}}

According to an interview with the artists of ''Avatar'', Appa's design was based on the [[Catbus]] in ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]'', due to the peculiar task of creating a mammal with six legs.<ref>{{Cite video | people = Bryan Konietzko and Michael Dante DiMartino | year = 2006 | title = Book 1: Water, Box Set | medium = DVD |date=2006-09-19}}</ref>

''Avatar'' draws inspiration from [[Shinichiro Watanabe]]'s ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'' and ''[[Samurai Champloo]]'', as well as ''[[FLCL]]'' (''Fooly Cooly'') of [[Gainax]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/894/894105p1.html|title=Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko talk Airbender|publisher=[[IGN]]|author=Mell, Tory Ireland|date=2008-07-26|accessdate=2008-07-28}}</ref> Other various studios from which inspiration was drawn include [[Studio 4°C]], [[Production I.G]], and [[Studio Ghibli]].<ref>{{cite journal |last =Mullins |first =Summer |authorlink = |coauthors = |year = |month = |title =Creation Station, an interview with Bryan Konietzko and Michael DiMartino |journal = |volume = |issue =39 |pages = 74|id = |url = |accessdate =  |quote = }}</ref> Bryan has commented that some of his most cherished Watanabe fight scenes were the fight between ''Bebop's'' [[Spike Spiegel]] and a drug smuggler in "[[List of Cowboy Bebop episodes|Asteroid Blues]]," as well as the duel between [[List of Samurai Champloo characters#Mugen|Mugen]] and a [[List of Samurai Champloo characters#Sara|blind female Jojutsu-user]] in the ''Champloo'' episode "[[List of Samurai Champloo episodes 13-26|Elegy of Entrapment (Verse 2)]]." ''Avatar'' director Giancarlo Volpe also claims the staff "were all ordered to buy ''FLCL'' and watch every single episode of it."<ref name="con" />

===Promotion and merchandising===
''Avatar'''s success has led to some promotional advertising with third-party companies, such as [[Burger King]] and [[Upper Deck Company|Upper Deck Entertainment]]. Avatar-themed [[roller coasters]] at [[Kings Island]] and at [[Nickelodeon Universe]] in the [[Mall of America]] also appeared. During the show's runtime, Nickelodeon published two special issues of ''[[Nickelodeon Magazine|Nick Mag Presents]]'' dedicated entirely to the show. Various members of the ''Avatar'' staff and cast appeared at the 2006 San Diego Comic-Con International convention, while Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko appeared with Martial Arts Consultant Sifu Kisu at the Pacific Media Expo on October 28, 2006. ''Avatar'' also has its own line of t-shirts, [[LEGO]] playsets, toys, a [[Avatar: The Last Airbender Trading Card Game|trading card game]], a [[cine-manga]], and two video games with a third to debut September 2008. Also in September; ''Avatar: Legends of the Arena'', an [[MMO]], will be released online. <ref name="ViacomMMO">{{cite web |url=http://www.viacom.com/news/Pages/newstext.aspx?RID=1179537 |title=Nickelodeon Unveils New Avatar Multiplayer Online Global Game in September |accessdate=2008-08-01 |work=Press Release |publisher=Viacom |date=2008-07-25 }}</ref>

The [[Mattel]]-produced action figure toy line generated some controversy with its exclusion of any female characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oafe.net/articulation/0707.php|title=Points of Articulation: An Open Letter to Mattel | publisher = [[OAFE]] | date = [[2007-07-28]] | accessdate=2008-09-13}}</ref> Mattel came to release information stating that they have taken account of Katara's increased role within the program, and that she would be included in the figure assortment for a mid 2007 release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.livejournal.com/avatar_fans/1658088.html|title=Live Journal}}</ref> The figure ultimately went unreleased, however, as the entire line was canceled before she could be produced.

Nickelodeon executives have since released highly optimistic plans for upcoming marketing strategies in regards to ''Avatar''. Nickelodeon President Cyma Zarghami openly stated his belief that the franchise "could become their ''[[Harry Potter]]''".<ref name="becomeharrypotter" /> They expect consumers to spend about $121 million in 2007, rising to $254 million by 2009.<ref name="becomeharrypotter" /> The marketing plans are to be coincided with the release of the first live-action film based on the series in 2010, which will be the first film in a trilogy.<ref name="becomeharrypotter">{{cite web | url = http://www.usatoday.com/money/media/2007-09-20-avatar_N.htm | title = Nick pins hopes on Avatar | publisher = [[USA Today]] | date = [[2007-09-20]] | accessdate=2008-04-16}}</ref>
