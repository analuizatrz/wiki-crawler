In the [[United States]], '''historically black colleges and universities''' ('''HBCUs''') are colleges or universities that were established before [[1964]] with the intention of serving the [[African American]] community. Other institutions have large numbers of African Americans in their student body, but were founded (or opened their doors to African Americans) after the ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' ruling by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] (the court decision which outlawed [[racial segregation]] of public education facilities).  By definition they are not '''historically''' black colleges. Such institutions have been termed '''predominantly black'''.
 
Today, there are 114 historically black colleges in the United States which vary between two year and four year institutions and public and private funding.  Most are located in the [[Southeastern United States]].  Four are located in the [[Midwestern United States|midwestern]] states (two each in [[Missouri]] and [[Ohio]]), one is in [[Delaware]], and one is in the [[United States Virgin Islands|Virgin Islands]].<ref>{{cite news|first=|last=|url= http://www.ed.gov/about/inits/list/whhbcu/edlite-list.html|publisher=U.S. Department of Education|date=2006-Jul-31| accessdate=2007-Mar-29}}</ref>
