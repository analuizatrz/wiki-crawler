'''Sapindaceae''', also known as the '''soapberry family''', is a [[family (biology)|family]] of [[flowering plant]]s in the order [[Sapindales]]. There are about 140-150 genera with 1400-2000 species, including [[maple]], [[horse chestnut]] and [[lychee]].

Sapindaceae members occur in temperate to tropical regions throughout the world. Many are lactiferous, i.e. they contain milky sap, and many contain mildly [[toxic]]  [[saponin]]s with [[soap]]-like qualities in either the foliage and/or the seeds, or roots. The largest genera are ''[[Serjania]]'', ''[[Paullinia]]'', ''[[Maple|Acer]]'' and ''[[Allophyllus]]''.

The largely temperate genera formerly separated in the families [[Aceraceae]] (''Acer'', ''[[Dipteronia]]'') and [[Hippocastanaceae]] (''[[Aesculus]]'', ''[[Billia]]'', ''[[Handeliodendron]]'') were included within a more broadly circumscribed Sapindaceae by the [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group| APG]]. Recent research has confirmed the inclusion of these genera in Sapindaceae.<ref name="singh">{{cite book |last=Singh |first=Gurjaran |title=Plant Systematics: An Integrated Approach |year=2004 |publisher=Science Publishers |location=Enfield, New Hampshire |isbn=1-57808-342-7| pages=pp. 438-440}}</ref><ref name="harrington">{{cite journal |last=Harrington |first=Mark G. |coauthors=Karen J.

==Characteristics==

Plants of this family have a variety of habits, from [[tree]]s to [[herbaceous plant]]s or [[liana]]s. Their leaves usually spirally alternate, sometimes (in ''Acer, Aesculus'', and a few other genera) opposite. They are most often [[leaf shape|pinnately compound]], sometimes palmately, or just palmate (''Acer'', ''Aesculus''), with a [[petiole]] lacking [[stipule]]s, but having a swollen base.<ref name="singh"/>

[[Flower]]s are small and [[unisexual]], or functionally unisexual, though plants may be either [[dioecy|dioecious]] or monoecious. They are usually grouped in [[inflorescence|cyme]]s grouped in [[panicle]]s. They most often have four or five [[petal]]s and [[sepal]]s (petals are absent in ''[[Dodonaea]]''). The [[stamen]]s range from four to ten, usually on a [[nectar disc]] between the petals and stamen,their filaments are often hairy. The most frequent number is eight, in two rings of four. The [[gynoecium]] contains two or three [[carpel]]s, sometimes up to six. There is usually only one [[style]] with a lobed [[stigma]]. Most often [[pollination|pollinated]] by birds or insects,with a few species pollinated by wind.<ref name="singh"/>

The [[fruit]]s are fleshy or dry,. They may be [[nut]]s, [[berries]], [[drupe]]s, [[schizocarp]]s, [[capsule (fruit)|capsule]]s (''[[Bridgesia]]''), or [[samara (fruit)|samara]]s (''Acer''). The embryos are bent or coiled, without [[endosperm]] in the seed, but frequently with an [[aril]].<ref name="singh"/>

==Classification==
Sapindaceae are related to [[Rutaceae]], and both are usually placed in an order [[Sapindales]] or [[Rutales]], depending on whether they are kept separate and which name is used for the order.<ref name="singh"/> The most [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] member appears to be ''[[Xanthoceras]]''. Some authors maintain some or all of [[Hippocastanaceae]] and [[Aceraceae]], although this may result in [[paraphyly]].<ref name="singh"/><ref name="harrington"/> The former [[Ptaeroxylaceae]], now placed in Rutaceae, were sometimes placed in Sapindaceae.<ref>{{cite web|author=Watson, L., and Dallwitz, M.J.| year=2007| title=Sapindaceae Juss.|work=The families of flowering plants: descriptions, illustrations, identification, and information retrieval |url= http://delta-intkey.com/angio/www/sapindac.htm |accessdate=2007-08-27}}</ref> The family is divided in 5 or 6 subfamily depending on treatment.

[[Image:Dimocarpus longan males F 070203 035 ime ed.jpg|thumb|right|Longan fruits.]]
Sapindaceae includes many species of economically valuable tropical [[fruit]], including the [[lychee]], the [[longan]], the [[Talisia esculenta|pitomba]], the [[korlan]], the [[rambutan]], the [[mamoncillo]] and the [[ackee]]. Other products include [[Guarana]], [[Soapberry|soapberries]] and [[maple syrup]].

Some species of [[Maple]] and [[Buckeye]] are valued for their wood, while several other genera, such as ''[[Koelreuteria]]'', ''[[Cardiospermum]]'' and ''[[Ungnadia]]'', are popular ornamentals. ''[[Schleichera trijuga]]'' is the source of Indian [[macassar oil]].
