The '''Battle of Stillman's Run''', also known as the '''Battle of Sycamore Creek''' or the '''Battle of Old Man's Creek''', occurred on [[May 14]] [[1832]]. The battle was named for Major [[Isaiah Stillman]] and his detachment of 275 Illinois militia which fled in a panic from around 50 of [[Sauk]] warriors. The engagement was the first battle of the 1832 [[Black Hawk War]] which had ignited after Black Hawk crossed the [[Mississippi River]] into Illinois with his "British Band" of Sauk and [[Fox (tribe)|Fox]]. Following a failed attempt at truce negotiations by emissaries sent by Black Hawk, the disorganized militia pursued a group of Sauk scouts back to the main British Band camp. 

During the engagement 12 militia men were killed while making a stand on a small hill. The rest of the militia fled back to [[Dixon's Ferry]] where they spread news of a terrible slaughter at Stillman's Run. It is believed that militia volunteer [[Abraham Lincoln]] helped bury the dead at the battlefield following the fight, this claim, however, was still under investigation as of 2003. An article published in 2006 corroborated Lincoln's presence at the burial; though there is little agreement amongst various other sources. In 1901 a monument was erected in [[Stillman Valley, Illinois]] commemorating the battle.

==Background==
Angered by the loss of his birthplace via prior disputed treaties, [[Black Hawk]] led a number of incursions across the [[Mississippi River]] beginning in 1830. Each time, he was persuaded to return west without bloodshed. In April 1832, encouraged by promises of alliances with other tribes and the [[United Kingdom|British]], he again moved his "[[British Band]]"<ref name=brit>The group was referred to as the "British Band", because of their earlier support to the British during the War of 1812 and continued reliance on British trade.

The conflict became known as the [[Black Hawk War]].

On [[April 5]], [[1832]], Black Hawk and around 1,000 warriors and civilians recrossed the [[Mississippi River]] into Illinois in an attempt to reclaim their land. About half of Black Hawk's band were combatants and the rest were a combination of women, children, and elderly. The band consisted of [[Sauk]], [[Fox]], some [[Potawatomi]], and some [[Kickapoo]]; in addition some members of the [[Ho-Chunk]] nation were sympathetic to Black Hawk.<ref name=lewis3>Lewis, James.

Atkinson was not informed of Governor Reynolds' decision to order Major [[Isaiah Stillman|Isaiah Stillman's]] militia to march on Old Man's Creek, despite being in overall command.

Prior to the battle at Stillman's Run, Black Hawk's grand vision of British support, and an [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] confederacy had collapsed.<ref name=nrhp2/> There would be no one to aid him or his followers. The British Band started to weaken with hunger, and Black Hawk soon realized that the only option was to return back across the [[Mississippi River]]. When he detected the U.S. militia camp eight miles (13 km) away, Black Hawk sent out peace envoys in order to negotiate a truce, they were told to wave a white flag at the militia.<ref name=wiscsr2/>

==Lincoln's role==

[[Abraham Lincoln|Abraham Lincoln's]] service during the Black Hawk War has been a source of discrepancies and questioning, with two major battle sites, including Stillman's Run, being affiliated with Lincoln in the aftermath of combat. A number of sources assert that on [[June 26]], [[1832]], the morning after the [[Battle of Kellogg's Grove|Second Battle of Kellogg's Grove]] members of the company of Captain Jacob M. Early arrived at Kellogg's Grove to help bury the dead. One of the soldiers in the company was Lincoln. Lincoln assisted with the burial and later made a statement about the experience that has been connected with both the battle at [[Kellogg's Grove]] and the fight at Stillman's Run.<ref name=nrhp>Dameier, Evelyn.

Following the first confrontation at Stillman Valley, the exaggerated claim that 2,000 "bloodthirsty warriors were sweeping all Northern Illinois with the bosom of destruction" sent shock waves of terror through the region.<ref name=stmuseum>"[http://www.il.ngb.army.mil/Museum/HistoricalEvents/Blackhawk.htm Black Hawk War]," Historical Events, ''Illinois State Military Museum''.
