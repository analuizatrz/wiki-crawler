'''Kyle Abbot''' is a fictional villain in [[DC Comics]], first appearing in [[Detective Comics]] #743. 

==Character history==
Formerly an agent for the late [[Ra's Al Ghul]], Kyle is the bodyguard of [[Whisper A'Daire]], empowered by his mistress with the same serum that gave her immortality and shapeshifting abilities. In Kyle's case, the serum turned him into an ageless [[werewolf]], second in command of a small army of similarly empowered [[henchmen]].

Able to inflict fatal wounds with ease, Kyle is a useful partner for Whisper. After having disfigured and half-blinded him with acid spit for having displeased her, Whisper searched him out again.  Kyle returned to work alongside Whisper, and was again injected with the serum to restore his youth but not his eye. Whisper tends to lash out at Kyle for any perceived failures, but the two remain partners.  His loyalty and eagerness to follow every order issued by his mistress, even the most gruesome, is total and absolute.

===52===
Kyle resurfaces in ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' week 11, with his role as bodyguard formalized, due to Whisper being known as a manager for HSC International Banking, a company connected with [[Intergang]]. He took Whisper's side in the HSC Headquarters when the [[Question (comics)|Question]] and [[Renee Montoya]] confronted them. Whisper fled, leaving to Kyle and a small group of shapeshifters the task of killing the pair. Kyle also left, shortly before the arrival of [[Batwoman]], leaving the battle to the other henchmen. Some weeks later, when the Question and Renee fled to Kahndaq searching for clues about Intergang, Kyle was able to track them, and frame the pair for the slaughter in an Intergang facility, disappearing again.

Returned in Gotham, he expresses increasing concerns about [[Bruno "Ugly" Mannheim]] increasing madness, only to gain the enmity of his former contractors. Splitting again with Whisper, he helps [[Renee Montoya]] into finding Batwoman, kidnapped and offered in sacrifice to Intergang, and leaves with [[Nightwing]] to disable some device planted in all Gotham to turn the city into a fire pit.

==Powers and abilities==
A tall and muscular bodyguard, trained in hand-to-hand and weapon combat, thanks to Ra's serum (which needs to be taken on a regular basis), Kyle is immortal and able to [[shapeshift]].  Appearing to be only in his thirties, he is at least sixty years old. After the events of [[Infinite Crisis]], he has increased in bulk and his eyesight has been restored. His shapeshifting abilities allow him to transform between his basic human form, a wolf form and an intermediate [[lycan]] form, in which he's described as a "large, furry brick". 

After Ra's death, it is uncertain how and where Whisper obtains the serum that grants their powers.
