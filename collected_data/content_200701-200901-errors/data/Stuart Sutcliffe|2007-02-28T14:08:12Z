'''Stuart Fergusson Victor Sutcliffe''' ([[23 June]] [[1940]] &ndash; [[10 April]] [[1962]]) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] artist who, until his death, worked in a style related to [[Abstract Expressionism]]. An art school friend of [[John Lennon]]'s, he was the original bassist of the British rock band [[the Beatles]] for two years, and is often credited for naming the band (after [[Buddy Holly]]'s band [[the Crickets]]). Along with former drummer [[Pete Best]], he can accurately be called one of only six true members of the Beatles.  Sutcliffe is often referred to as "[[fifth Beatle|the fifth Beatle]]".  

==Biography==
===Life===
He was born at Simpson Memorial Maternity Pavilion Hospital, [[Edinburgh]], [[Lothian]], and brought up in [[Huyton]], [[Merseyside]]. He attended [[Prescot Grammar School]] and was himself a schoolteacher's son.

While Sutcliffe was a gifted painter who showed great promise, with personal [[charisma]] and looks comparable with [[James Dean]]'s, his musical skills were not remarkable. Sutcliffe became a Beatle mostly because of his friendship with Lennon, whom he met while studying at the [[Liverpool College of Art]]. Lennon convinced him to buy a [[bass guitar]] (choosing a [[Höfner]] 500/5 model, known in [[Europe]] as a 500/5 ''President'') <ref>[http://www.rockmine.com/Stu2.html]</ref> with the money he had made from the sale of his picture ''The Summer Painting'' (1959).<ref>[http://www.stuartsutcliffeart.com/gallery.php?category=Middle%20Work Sutcliffe's art]</ref> Sutcliffe has been described as appearing very uncomfortable on stage and even played with his back to the audience, but early Beatles drummer [[Pete Best]] says that these claims are exaggerated, and that Sutcliffe was usually good-natured and "animated" onstage<ref>[http://www.rickresource.com/rrp/petebest.html An Evening With Pete Best, Part I: The Interview] URL accessed Jan 20, 2007</ref>. Sutcliffe's [[musical style]] was elementary, mostly sticking to [[root note]]s of [[Chord (music)|chords]]. (An example of Sutcliffe's bass playing with the early Beatles is the track "Cayenne", on the ''[[Anthology 1]]'' album.)

Bill Harry, founder and editor of the ''[[Mersey Beat]]'' newspaper, has said that Sutcliffe was a competent, although not brilliant, [[bassist]], and that accounts of his musical ineptitude were exaggerated. Original Beatles [[drummer]] [[Pete Best]] has expressed similar views<ref>[http://www.rickresource.com/rrp/petebest.html An Evening With Pete Best, Part I: The Interview] URL accessed Jan 20, 2007</ref>. Nevertheless, Sutcliffe's importance to the group derived from his artistic rather than musical talent. His sense of style, influenced by his lover, [[Astrid Kirchherr]], contributed to the Beatles' early "look". He also had a profound influence on his close friend Lennon, reinforcing the rebellious Lennon's aspiration to art and the [[Bohemianism|bohemian lifestyle]], which were on display during the Beatles' [[psychedelic]] period (1966–1968) and Lennon's solo [[Avant-garde]] work with [[Yoko Ono]].

===Death===
Sutcliffe left the Beatles before they achieved their success to pursue his career as an artist and to marry Kirchherr. [[Paul McCartney]], previously second lead guitarist in the group, replaced Sutcliffe on bass. Months afterwards, in the spring of [[1962]], at age 21, Sutcliffe died from a [[brain haemorrhage]]; after collapsing in the middle of an art class, he was taken to a hospital, but died in the ambulance.<ref name="CynthiaJohnp110"> Cynthia Lennon– “John”. p110.</ref> It has been claimed that his death was the result of a beating sustained in Liverpool while still a member of the group, but it is more likely to have been a [[congenital disorder]]. 

Lennon later said that he was profoundly affected by his friend's death.  
Sutcliffe's sister, Pauline, has always claimed that Lennon was the cause of her brother's death, asserting that the two had fought in [[Hamburg, Germany]] a short while earlier. According to her account, Lennon had repeatedly kicked Sutcliffe in the head and Sutcliffe never recovered from the injuries. (Her claims are echoed in [[Albert Goldman]]'s controversial 1988 book ''[[The Lives of John Lennon]]''.) In 2001, she claimed that late in his life, Lennon himself had admitted this attack and felt guilty over the possible role it played in Sutcliffe's death. However, beyond Pauline, there is no corroboration. Kirchherr, former manager Allan Williams, the other Beatles and many close associates have stated repeatedly that the attack against Sutcliffe occurred at the [[Litherland]] Town Hall in Liverpool after a live performance sometime in 1961. The Beatles were protective of each other as many Liverpool musical venues were located in seedy areas of the city and well known for frequent fights instigated by local roughs. According to published accounts, it was Lennon and Pete Best who saved Sutcliffe from much worse injury by fighting off attackers and taking him to safety.

Because of the limitations of medical knowledge at that time, it has never been known what caused the brain haemorrhage that took Sutcliffe's life.  But according to descriptions of the symptoms he suffered, and thanks to advanced study of neurovascular afflictions, it has been suggested that the cause of death was [[arteriovenous malformation]].

The Beatles paid homage to Sutcliffe by including his portrait among those on the cover of ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' in 1967 (he appears at the extreme left, next to fellow-artist [[Aubrey Beardsley]]).

==Art==
[[Image:Sutcliffe painting.jpg|thumb|right|''Hamburg Painting no. 2'']]As an artist, Sutcliffe displayed considerable talent from an early age. His few surviving works show the influence of the British and [[European]] abstract artists contemporary with the [[Abstract Expressionism|Abstract Expressionist]] movement in the [[United States]]. His earlier figurative work is reminiscent of the [[kitchen sink realism|kitchen sink school]], particularly [[John Bratby]], though he was also producing abstract work by the end of the 1950s, including ''The Summer Painting'', the sale of which to [[John Moores]] fincanced his guitar. His later gestural abstractions were influenced by his art tutor in Hamburg, [[Eduardo Paolozzi]].[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/collections/20c/sutcliffe.asp] They also bear comparison with the work of John Hoyland and [[Nicolas de Staël]], though they are more lyrical. These later works are typically untitled, constructed from heavily impasted slabs of pigment, in the manner of de Staël, overlaid with scratched or squeezed linear elements creating enclosed spaces. ''Hamburg Painting no. 2'' was purchased by Liverpool's [[Walker Art Gallery]].

==Anthology 1==
The Beatles' compilation album ''[[Anthology 1]]'', consisting mostly of previously unreleased recordings from the band's early years, was released in 1995.  Sutcliffe is pictured on the front cover, as he was on ''Sgt. Pepper'' 28 years before.  More importantly, he is featured playing bass with the Beatles on three songs that the band recorded in 1960: "Hallelujah, I Love Her So", "[[You'll Be Mine]]", and "[[Cayenne (song)|Cayenne]]".  These songs are, to date, the only officially sanctioned recordings of Stuart Sutcliffe playing with the Beatles.

==Film Portrayals==
Sutcliffe's role in the Beatles' early career, as well as the factors that led him to leave the group, is dramatised in the film ''[[Backbeat (movie)|Backbeat]]'', in which he was portrayed by [[Stephen Dorff]]. He was also portrayed by David Wilkinson in the film ''[[Birth of the Beatles]]'' and by Lee Williams in ''In My Life: The John Lennon Story'' (2000).
