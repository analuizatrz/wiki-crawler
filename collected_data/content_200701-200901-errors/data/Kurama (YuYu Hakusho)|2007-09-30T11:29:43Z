{{nihongo|'''Kurama'''|蔵馬|Kurama}} is a [[fictional character]] in the [[anime]] and [[manga]] series ''[[YuYu Hakusho]]'' by [[Yoshihiro Togashi]]. In the human world, Kurama is also known as {{nihongo|'''Shuichi Minamino'''|南野秀一|Minamino Shūichi}}.

Kurama is first encountered in the series at the same time as Hiei. His ability is in manipulating plants, and he generally wields a whip created from a rose vine, complete with thorns. He is one of the wiser and more intelligent characters in the series.

Kurama's [[seiyu|seiyū]] are [[Megumi Ogata]] for his human form, and [[Shigeru Nakahara]] as Yoko Kurama. As there are several US dubs done by different companies, Kurama has had three English voice actors: [[John Burgmeier]] in the [[FUNimation]] version, [[David Hayter|Sean Barker]] in the [[Media Blasters]] dub, and [[Hideo Seaver]] in [[U.S. Manga Corps]]' version.

Note that Kurama generally refers to Kurama in his human form, whereas Kurama in his fox demon form is usually referred to as '''Fox Demon Kurama''' or {{nihongo|'''Yoko Kurama'''|妖狐 蔵馬|Yōko Kurama, literally "Spirit Fox Kurama"}}; the English-language manga uses "Fox Demon Kurama," while the English anime uses "Yoko Kurama."

==Personality==
Kurama is generally regarded as the most calm and level-headed member of the group. His analytical nature is present in battle where he prefers to study the strengths and weaknesses of his opponents before devising a strategy of his own.

He is protective of those he cares about and is often merciless to anyone that poses them a threat, a shift in his usually friendly manner. In many instances, Kurama has shown to be very self-sacrificing in the interests of the safety of his friends and family.

==Biography==
[[Image:Yoko Kurama.jpg|thumb|right|Fox Demon Kurama/Yoko Kurama]]

Fox Demon Kurama/Yoko Kurama was a cold hearted and ruthless thief and the most feared bandit in [[Makai]]. He was considered to be an A-class demon, and is said to be more than a thousand years old.

After being wounded by a bounty hunter while in his spirit fox form, Kurama sent his spirit into the Ningenkai (human world) where his spirit took refuge within an unborn child that had not yet gained a soul. It was from this point that Kurama made the transfer to a human body with the intention to recover his strength as the child developed. Kurama planned to leave Ningenkai to return to Makai after regaining his strength after an estimated ten years. However, sometime during or before the tenth year, an act of selflessness by his mother, Shiori Minamino, opened Kurama's eyes to pain he had caused his mother while growing up. Thus, he decides to continue living his human life as Shiori's son.

Kurama is first introduced to the series with [[Hiei (YuYu Hakusho)|Hiei]] and Goki (''Gouki'' in the English anime, ''Goki'' in the English manga). Together they stole three powerful artifacts from Spirit World, which [[Yusuke Urameshi]] has to retrieve as his first assignment as Spirit Detective. Kurama stole the ''Forlorn Hope'', a mirror that has the power to grant its user a wish during the full moon in exchange for their life. Upon meeting Kurama, Yusuke finds out that Kurama has no intention of using the mirror to cause harm, but only wishes to use its power to save his mother from an illness.

Before the [[Dark Tournament Saga]], Kurama is unable to revert to his Fox Demon form. However, while fighting [[List of minor enemies in YuYu Hakusho#Ura Urashima|Ura Urashima]] of Team Uratogi (Fractured Fairy Tales in the English manga), an item called The Reverse Treasure Box (Reverse Magic Box in English Manga, Idun Box in the English Dub) emits smoke that causes him to revert to his original Fox Demon form. He transforms back into Shuichi when [[List of minor allies in YuYu Hakusho#Shishiwakamaru|Shishiwakamaru]] breaks the barrier that was keeping the smoke inside the arena. The last opponent Kurama faces in this tournament is Karasu, a man with an obsessive desire to kill Kurama. Knowing that he cannot defeat Karasu in his human form, Kurama seeks a way to transform himself back into his Fox Demon form. [[List of minor allies in YuYu Hakusho#Suzuki|Suzuki]] of Team Uratogi gives Kurama some potion made from the Fruit of the Past Life (from either Spirit World or Demon World, depending upon whether the source is the English or Japanese version) that he used to make the Reverse Treasure Box. After testing it, Kurama finds out that it will make him transform into his Fox Demon form, but only for fifteen minutes. Kurama takes some of the potion before his battle with Karasu, but it does not take effect until after he is badly injured. Kurama is able to trap Karasu in his Ojigi Plant, and believes to have defeated him. Unfortunately, Karasu is still alive, and the potion's effect wear off even before the fifteen minutes are over. Karasu manages to severely injure Kurama in his human form, but Kurama unleashes a blood sucking plant on Karasu, an attack that Kurama expected would kill him because it would use up his remaining life energy. However, Kurama does not die due to the fact that each time he drank the potion, the effect does not last as long because he regained some of his original demon strength, and this enabled him to survive. In the [[Chapter Black Saga]], Kurama's anger over Yusuke's death gives him increase in demon energy making him an A class demon and transforming him into his Fox Demon form, while keeping his human personality.  After the [[Chapter Black Saga]], Kurama seems to be able to transform into his Fox Demon form at will.  

Between the events of the Chapter Black and the [[Saga of the Three Kings]], Shiori Minamino remarries, and her new husband is Hatanaka, the president at a company where Shiori works. Kurama also gains a new stepbrother, also named Shuichi.<ref>Shuichi's name was changed to '''Kokoda''' in the English dub.</ref>

In the [[Saga of the Three Kings]], Kurama is called on by [[Yomi (YuYu Hakusho)|Yomi]], his former partner when he was still a thief in Makai. Kurama's internal struggles become more apparent in this saga because of the three different aspects of himself: Kurama as he is when he fights alongside Yusuke and his companions, the Fox Demon Kurama, and the human Shuichi Minamino. At this point wherein he relives most of his past, his Fox Demon personality is somewhat predominant, as he seems to want to live the life he lost when the bounty hunter shot him. In moments of duress or battle, Kurama (who retained the A-class powers even in his human form after Sensui was defeated), would transform into the Fox Demon Kurama and his ruthless personality would return (now at an S-class level).

After the death of Raizen, Yusuke comes to Yomi's territory with a proposition; a new tournament which will determine the ruler of whole Makai. Yomi accepts and the tournament begins. Kurama's team qualifies easily in the preliminary round but after that the team faces stronger opponents and each member is defeated one by one. Then, Kurama fights Shigure, "The Demon Surgeon." During a fierce battle he manages to defeat Shigure and destroy his weapon. Unable to accept this, Shigure commits suicide. Kurama is qualified to the next round but is unable to continue fighting due to severe injuries.

After his fight with Shigure, he decides to not look to the past for answers to the future and with his loyalty to his human mother and his friends, he leaves his Fox Demon lifestyle behind. After the end of the Makai/Demon World Tournament, Kurama goes back to Ningenkai and gets a job at his stepfather's company. He lives like a normal human being from then on alongside Yusuke, Kuwabara, and his other friends--except for Hiei, who decides to continue living in Makai.

==In other media==
===Movies===
Kurama appears in both of the YuYu Hakusho movies, [[YuYu Hakusho: The Movie]] and [[Yu Yu Hakusho, The Movie: Poltergeist Report]].

In [[Yu Yu Hakusho, The Movie: Poltergeist Report]], a character named Kuronue<ref>Kuronue's original Japanese name is Kurobue.</ref> is introduced as the Fox Demon Kurama's former partner in thievery. One of the Netherworld Gods impersonates Kuronue in an attempt to gain the upper hand to defeat Kurama, but Kurama eventually discovers this deceit and kills the Netherworld God.

===Video games===
Kurama appears as a playable character in all of the YuYu Hakusho video games, and he also appears in the game ''[[Jump Ultimate Stars]]'' for the [[Nintendo DS]] as a playable character.

==Powers and abilities==
Kurama's special ability is that he can turn plants into deadly weapons by manipulating his youki into that plant. Kurama has complete control over any Human Realm plant and has some control over Demon Realm plants. However Demon Fox Kurama has complete control over Demon Realm Plants and has more power than regular Kurama. The strength of Kurama's moves depends on how much aura Kurama uses. He has an incredible sense of smell (evident when he fights Genbu) and he can [[Lip reading|read lips]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Togashi |first= Yoshihiro |title= YuYu Hakusho Volume 14 Chapter 9 |publisher= [[Shueisha]]}}</ref>

===Techniques/moves===
* {{nihongo|'''Rose Whip/Bara Shibenjin'''|ローズ ウイップ/薔薇棘鞭刃|Rose Thorny Whip-blade}}: With this technique, Kurama uses his aura (yōki) to grow a rose from its seed state to its flowering state and then into a long thorny whip that is capable of cutting even through steel. This weapon was first introduced during Kurama's battle against Genbu of the Four Beasts. This is Kurama's most commonly used weapon.
** {{nihongo|'''Kagon Retsuzanshi'''|華厳裂斬枝|''Splendid Limb-Severing''}} or '''Rose Whiplash''' in the English Dub: Kurama uses this technique against Genbu of the Four Beasts, and it involves swiftly slashing in multiple directions with his whip to destroy Genbu's body.
** '''Fūka Enbu Jin'''　in the Japanese version, ''''Rose Whip Thorn Wheel''' in the English Dub, or '''Petal Whirlwind''' in the English Manga: This is a defensive technique seen when Kurama fights against Karasu. Kurama uses it to buy time before he transforms into Yoko Kurama under the effect of the potion he took. It is essentially a whirlwind of rose petals hovering around him and if the opponent/attacker gets within a certain range the petals attack and rip them to shreds. 
* {{nihongo|'''Shimaneki Sō'''|死招き草|''Deathbringer Weed''}} or '''Seed of the Death Plant''' in the English dub and "Deadly Vetch" in the Viz translation: This is a small seed that Kurama plants in his opponent's body and can be manipulated using his yōki. After it has had enough time to secure its roots within the victim's body, the Shimaneki can kill the victim. This attack was only used in the Dark Tournament Saga and was first used against Roto of the Jolly Devil Six/Team Rokuyukai, who threatened to kill Kurama's human mother with a messenger Yōkai if Kurama attacked him. Kurama was able to plant the Shimaneki on Roto and fought Roto long enough for the seed to take root. During his match against [[Toya (YuYu Hakusho)|Touya]] of the Team Mashotsukai/Team Masho/Shadow Channelers with his yōki sealed away from a curse brought on from his previous match Kurama was forced to place the seed in his body to use the yoki in his body and was able to use the Shimaneki as a sword-like weapon to render Touya unconscious.
* {{nihongo|'''Shoku Yō Shokubutsu'''|食妖植物|''Devourer Demon Plant''}} or '''Death Tree''' in the English Dub: Used by Yoko Kurama during his match against Reverse Urashima/Ura Urashima of Team Uratogi/Fractured Fairy Tales in the Dark Tournament. This is a giant redwood carnivorous tree with an acidic saliva that strikes anything that moves. Yoko Kurama used this to force Ura to tell him the secret of the Reverse Treasure Box. This would have worked if Ura hadn't been killed by his teammate Shishiwakamaru for trying to give away their secrets.
* {{nihongo|'''Makai Ojigi Sō'''|魔界オジギ草|''Demon Realm Bow Weed''}} or '''Ojigi Plant''' in the English Dub: Used during his match against Karasu this is where Yoko Kurama was able to use this plant to counter Karasu's bombs. This deadly plant is from South America where it responds to movements or flammables by closing its leaves around its prey and crushes it to death. Although this plant managed to bind Karasu, he was able to create an explosion from within destroying this plant.
* {{nihongo|'''Kyūketsu Shokubutsu'''|吸血植物|''Bloodsucking Plant''}}('''Vampire Plant''' in VIZ Media Dub): A blood sucking Demon Realm plant that also was used against Karasu in the Team Toguro Match. When Kurama reverted from his fox demon form to his human form and with his yōki running low, Kurama deliberately placed a Shimaneki seed on Karasu's chest knowing that he would find it so it would expose his blood. Kurama intended to sacrifice himself in this attack to kill Karasu, who thought that Kurama could only control plants from the Human World while in his human form.
* {{nihongo|'''Janenju'''|邪念樹|''Tree of Depravity''}} or '''Sinning Tree''' in the English Dub: This plant was used by Kurama in the Chapter Black Saga in the fight against Gourmet (Sadao Makihara). Knowing that Elder Toguro was now in control of Gourmet's body, Kurama placed this seed on his Rose Whip, which was planted on Gourmet's body when Kurama decapitated him. The tree would send its victim their worst fears until they die, but since Elder Toguro was incapable of dying, it would prey on him forever.
* {{nihongo|'''Juryō Yōzan Ken'''|樹霊妖斬拳|''Wood Spirit Demon Beheading Technique''}} or '''The Binding Fist of the Demonic Vine''' in the English Dub: Used by Yoko Kurama during his battle against Shinobu Sensui. It is similar to the Rose Whip in that it is composed of a vine with thorns, but this time it grows around Kurama's arm and is wielded as a sword-like weapon.
* '''Okunenju Ueki''' (''Okunenju Trees'') or '''Okunenju Roots''' in the English Dub: Used during Kurama's battle against Shigure in the Three Kings Saga to show that using his fox demon form was not his trump card. It involves growing a large tree that overran the entire fighting arena. It resembles a [[Sakura|cherry tree]], reflective of Kurama's memories of climbing the cherry tree in his front yard as a child.
* '''Bamboo Plant''': Not officially named, this plant was used in Yu Yu Hakusho: Poltergeist Report to kill a Netherworld God that had impersonated Kuronue. Its tips are extremely sharp, piercing the body as it grows.
* '''Akaru Zassō''' (''Akaru Weed'') or '''Lamp Weed''' in the English Dub: Kurama used these weeds as markers in the maze-like Irma Cave (Demon Door's Cave in the English Dub) in the Chapter Black Saga. Kurama planted a few of these just before their encounter with Game Master (Tsukihito Amanuma). Koenma was later able to use these to help him find his way to join up with the others to fight Sensui.  
* {{nihongo|'''Fuyōka no Makai Shokubutsu'''|浮葉科の魔界植物|''Floating Leaves from Demon Realm Plant''}} or '''Leaf of a Plant''' in the English Dub: This plant appears as "wings" similar to that of a butterfly on Kurama's back. Doubling as a glider, this plant is what Kurama (in his fox demon form) places on his back to aid himself, Kuwabara, and Hiei as they fell from the portal that linked the Human World to the Demon World in the Chapter Black Saga.
