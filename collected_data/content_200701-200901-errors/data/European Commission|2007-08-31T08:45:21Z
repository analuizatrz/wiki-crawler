The '''European Commission''' (formally the '''Commission of the European Communities''') is the [[executive (government)|executive branch]] of the [[European Union]]. It is a [[cabinet government]] of 27 "[[European Commissioner|Commissioners]]" led by a [[President of the European Commission|Commission President]] (currently [[José Manuel Barroso]]). The present Commission, known after its President as the "[[Barroso Commission]]" took office in late 2004 and is serving a five-year term. The body is responsible for proposing legislation, implementing decisions, upholding the [[Treaties of the European Union|Union's treaties]] and the general day-to-day running of the Union.<ref name="Europa Institutions">{{cite web|title=Institutions of the EU: The European Commission|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/comm/index_en.htm|accessdate=2007-06-18}}</ref>

The term "Commission" can mean either the college of Commissioners mentioned above, or the larger [[Institutions of the European Union|institution]]; including the administrative body of about 25,000 European civil servants who are divided into departments called [[Directorate-General|Directorates-General]]. It is primarily based in the [[Berlaymont building]] of [[Brussels]] and its internal [[working language]]s are [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]].<ref name="Europa Institutions"/>

==History==
{{Politics of the European Union}}
{{main|History of the European Commission}}
The first Commission originated in 1951 as the nine-member "High Authority". The Authority was the [[supranational]] administrative executive of the new [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC). In 1958 the [[Treaties of Rome]] established two new communities along side the ECSC: the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) and the [[European Atomic Energy Community]] (Euratom). Both these two communities had an executive like the ECSC, although it used the new name of "Commission". The three bodies co-existed until [[1 July]] [[1967]] where, by means of the [[Merger Treaty]], they were combined into a single administration under President [[Jean Rey (politician)|Jean Rey]]. Rey is recognised as the second President, the first being the President of the EEC's Commission, [[Walter Hallstein]]. This combined body was called the "Commission of the European Communities".<ref>{{cite web|title = European Commission.|publisher=[[European NAvigator]]|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=3202|accessdate=2007-06-18}}</ref>

One of the most successful Commissioners was that headed by [[Jacques Delors]] (the [[Delors Commission]]), with later Presidents failing to meet the same success.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Burson-Marsteller]]|title=The new Commission - some initial thoughts|date=2004|url=http://www.bmbrussels.be/box_bmnewcomm.php|accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref> However the body did see expansions in its powers, with President [[Romano Prodi|Prodi]] being dubbed as the "Prime Minister of Europe" following the [[Amsterdam Treaty]].<ref>{{cite web|last=James|first=Barry|title=Prodi to Have Wide, New Powers as Head of the European Commission|publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]]|date=[[1999-04-16]]|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/1999/04/16/eu.2.t_0.php|accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref> The Commission has also come under greater control of the [[European Parliament]], aiding its legitimacy; in 1999, pressure and threats from the Parliament forced the resignation of the [[Santer Commission]]<ref>{{cite web|last = Topan|first=Angelina|title = The resignation of the Santer-Commission: the impact of 'trust' and 'reputation' |date=[[2002-09-30]]|publisher=European Integration Online Papers|url=http://eiop.or.at/eiop/pdf/2002-014.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref> and in 2004, [[José Manuel Barroso]] was forced to reshuffle his Commission proposals due to opposition from many [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Tobais|first=Troll|title =“We have to democratise procedures”|date=[[2004-11-02]]|publisher=Café Babel|url=http://www.cafebabel.com/en/article.asp?T=T&Id=2620|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref>

==Powers and functions==
[[Image:Jose Manuel BarrosoCROPPED.jpg|left|thumb|Incumbent President Barroso]]
The Commission was set up from the start to act as an independent supranational authority separate from governments, it has been described as "the only body paid to think European".<ref name="Day">{{cite web|title = Interview with European Commission Secretary-General Catherine Day|publisher=EurActiv|date=[[2006-09-25]]|url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/future-eu/interview-european-commission-secretary-general-catherine-day/article-158149 |accessdate = 2007-06-17}}</ref> The members are proposed by their state governments, one from each, however they are bound to act independently &mdash; neutral from other influences such as those governments which appointed them. This is in contrast to the [[Council of the European Union|Council]], which represents governments, and the [[European Parliament|Parliament]], which represents [[EU citizen|citizens]].<ref name="Europa Institutions"/> 

Executive power of the Union is held by the Council, it confers on the Commission such powers for it to exercise. However the Council may withdraw these powers, exercising them directly, or impose conditions on their use.<ref>{{cite web|title=Executive body.|publisher=[[European NAvigator]]|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=3312 |accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = Implementing powers of the Council of the European Union.|publisher=[[European NAvigator]]|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=5625 |accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref> Powers are outlined in Articles 211–219 of the EC treaty<ref>{{cite web|publisher = [[Europa (web portal)]]|title = Consolidated version of the Treaty Establishing the European Community|url=http://europa.eu/eur-lex/en/treaties/dat/C_2002325EN.003301.html|accessdate = 2007-06-17}}</ref> and are more restricted than most national executives, in part due to  the Commission's lack of power over areas like [[Common Foreign and Security Policy|foreign policy]] &mdash; that power is held by the [[European Council]], which some have described as another executive. Considering that under the [[Reform Treaty]] the European Council would become a formal institution with the power of appointing the Commission, it could be said that the two bodies hold the executive power of the Union (the European Council also holds individual national executive powers). However, it is the Commission which currently holds executive powers over the [[European Community]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Bermann|first=George|title=Executive Power in the New European Constitution|date=2004|url=http://www.jeanmonnetprogram.org/papers/04/040501-13.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=[[New York University]]|accessdate = 2006-06-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Stark|first=Christine|publisher = Dragoman|title = Evolution of the European Council: The implications of a permanent seat|date=[[2002-09-04]]|url=http://www.dragoman.org/ec/belfast-2002.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate = 2007-07-10}}</ref> The [[government]]al powers of the Commission have been such that some such as former [[Belgian Prime Minister]] [[Guy Verhofstadt]] have suggested changing its name to the "European Government", calling the present name of commission: ''"ridiculous"''.<ref>{{cite book| last = Verhofstadt| first =Guy| title =The United States of Europe| publisher =Federal Trust| date =2006| location =[[London]]| pages =69| isbn =1-903403-86-3}}</ref>

The Commission differs from the other institutions in that it alone has [[legislative initiative]] over the European Community, meaning only the Commission can make formal proposals for legislation — [[bill (proposed law)|bills]] cannot originate in the legislative branch. It shares this right with the Council over the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy|CFSP pillar]], and has no right over [[Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters]]. In the Community however, Council and Parliament are able to request legislation; in most cases the Commission initiates the basis of these proposals, this monopoly is designed to ensure coordinated and coherent drafting of [[Law of the European Union|Union law]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher = [[Europa (web portal)]]|title = Glossary: Right of initiative.|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/initiative_right_en.htm |accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher = [[Europa (web portal)|Council of the European Union]]|title = The Commission's right of initiative|url=http://register.consilium.eu.int/pdf/en/02/cv00/00230en2.pdf |accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref> This monopoly has been challenged by some who claim the Parliament should also have the right, with most national parliaments holding the right in some respects.<ref>{{cite web|last = Murray|first=Alasdair|title = Reform not or languish later.|publisher=[[Centre for European Reform]]|date=[[2002-09-30]]|url=http://www.cer.org.uk/articles/murray_parl_0902.html |accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref> Under the Reform Treaty, EU citizens would also be able to request the Commission to legislate in an area via a petition carrying one million signatures, but it would not be binding.<ref>{{cite web|last = Wallis |first = Diana| authorlink =Diana Wallis|last2=Picard|first2=Severine|title = The Citizens' Right of Initiative in the European Constitution: A Second Chance for Democracy.|url=http://www.eumap.org/journal/features/2005/demodef/wallis |accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref>

Once legislation is passed, it is the Commission's responsibility to ensure it is implemented. It does this through the member states or through the its [[Agencies of the European Union|agencies]]. In adopting the necessary technical measures, the Commission is assisted by committees made up of representatives of member states (a process known in jargon as "[[comitology]]").<ref>{{cite web|publisher = [[Europa (web portal)]]|title = Glossary: Comitology.|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/comitology_en.htm |accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref> Furthermore, the Commission is responsible for the implementation of the [[EU budget]]; ensuring, along with the [[Court of Auditors]], that EU funds are correctly spent. In particular the Commission has a duty to ensure the treaties and law are upheld, potentially by taking member states or other institutions to the [[European Court of Justice|Court of Justice]] in a dispute. In this role it is known informally as the "guardian of the treaties".<ref>{{cite web|publisher = [[Europa (web portal)]]|title = The European Commission.|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/comm/index_en.htm |accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref> Finally, the Commission provides some [[foreign relations of the European Union|external representation]] for the Union, along side the member states and the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]], representing the Union in bodies such as the [[World Trade Organisation]]. It is also usual for the President to attend meetings of the [[G8]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher = [[Europa (web portal)]]|title = The European Commission.|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/comm/index_en.htm |accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref>

==College==
[[Image:European Commission Room (Open Day) 1.jpg|right|thumb|Floor 13 of the Berlaymont, Commission's meeting room]]
The [[President of the European Commission|President of the Commission]] is first nominated by the European Council; that nominee is then officially elected by the [[European Parliament]]. The candidate selected by the Council has often been, but is not by definition, a leading national politician. In 2004, the proposed Constitution had included a provision that the choice of President must take into account the latest [[Elections in the European Union|Parliamentary elections]]. That provision was not in force in the nomination in 2004, but the centre-right parties of the EU pressured for a candidate from their own ranks. In the end, a right-wing candidate was chosen: [[José Manuel Barroso]] of the [[European People's Party]].<ref>{{cite web|last =|first=|title =Choosing a New EU Commission President| publisher =[[Deutsche Welle]]]|date=[[2004-06-16]]|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,1237192,00.html|accessdate = 2007-08-27}}</ref> There are further criteria influencing the choice of the Council, these include: which area of Europe the candidate comes from, favoured as Southern Europe in 2004; the candidate's political influence, credible yet not overpowering members; language, proficiency in French considered necessary by France; and degree of integration, their state being a member of both the [[eurozone]] and the [[Schengen Agreement]].<ref>{{cite web|last =Fuller|first=Thimas|title =Portuguese premier wants to unite bloc : Barroso nominated to head EU executive| publisher =[[International Herald Tribune]]|date=[[2004-06-30]]|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/06/30/eu_ed3__5.php|accessdate = 2007-07-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last =Stuart|first=Paul|title =Portugal’s Prime Minister Barroso nominated as European Commission president| publisher =World Socialist Web Site|date=[[2004-07-21]]|url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2004/jul2004/port-j21.shtml|accessdate = 2007-07-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last =|first=|title =José Manuel Durão Barroso: The New Commission President| publisher =Grayling|date=2004|url=http://www.graylingbrussels.com/Vote4CommissionPresident/index.php?page=barossoprofile|accessdate = 2007-07-01}}</ref> In 2004, this system produced a number of candidates<ref>{{cite web|last =|first=|title =Commission president: Key candidates| publisher =[[BBC News]]|date=[[2004-06-27]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3816901.stm|accessdate = 2007-07-01}}</ref> and was thus criticised by some MEPs: following the drawn-out selection, the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats|ALDE group]] leader described the procedure as a "[[Justus Lipsius building|Justus Lipsius]] carpet market" producing only the "lowest common denominator"; while [[European Greens–European Free Alliance|Green-EFA]] co-leader [[Daniel Cohn-Bendit]] asked Barroso after his first speech "If you are the best candidate, why were you not the first?"<ref>{{cite web|last =Cohn-Bendit|first=Daniel|title = Nomination of Commission President handled "in a most unsatisfactory way"| publisher =[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]] |date=2004|url=http://www.grahamwatsonmep.org/news/000025.html|accessdate = 2007-07-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last =Watson|first=Graham|title =Statement by the President-designate of the Commission| publisher =Graham Watson MEP website|date=[[2004-07-21]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+CRE+20040721+ITEM-006+DOC+XML+V0//EN&language=EN|accessdate = 2007-07-01}}</ref>

Following their appointment, the President appoints a number of [[Vice-President of the European Commission|Vice-Presidents]] among the [[European Commissioner|Commissioners]]. At present there are five, with [[Margot Wallström]] as the current "First" Vice President. For the most part, the position grants little extra power to Vice-Presidents, except the first Vice-President who stands in for the President when he is away. The Commission is composed of a 27-member college of "[[European Commissioner|Commissioners]]", this is including the President and vice-presidents. Even though each member is appointed by a national government, one per state, they do not represent their state in the Commission. One proposed, the President delegates portfolios between each of the members, they must then a whole be approved by the Parliament before they can take office.<ref name="Europa Institutions"/> The present Commission, the [[Barroso Commission]], took office in late 2004 after being delayed by objections from the Parliament which forced a reshuffle. In 2007 the Commission increased from 25 to 27 members with the accession of [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] who each appointed their own Commissioners. With the increasing size of the Commission, President Barroso has adopted a more Presidential style of control over the college, which has earned him some criticism.<ref>{{cite web|last = Beunderman |first=Mark|publisher=EU Observer|title = EU commission sees civil servants' power grow.|date=[[2007-02-22]]|url=http://euobserver.com/843/23553 |accessdate = 2007-02-27}}</ref> Furthermore, there has also been a greater degree of [[European Commissioner#Politicisation|politicisation within the Commission]], being welcomed by Commissioner Wallström as necessary for citizens' engagement in European affairs.<ref>{{cite web|last = Mahony |first=Honor|publisher=EU Observer|title = Brussels struggles with communication policy.|date=[[2007-05-07]]|url=http://euobserver.com/9/24016 |accessdate = 2007-05-12}}</ref>

==Organisation==
[[Image:Berlaymont Press Room.jpg|thumb|right|Press Room in the Berlaymont]]
The Commission is primarily based in Brussels, with the Presidents office and the Commission's meeting room are based on the 13th floor of  the [[Berlaymont]] building. The Commission also operates out of [[Brussels and the European Union|numerous other buildings in Brussels]] and [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]].<ref name="Europa Institutions"/><ref>{{cite web|last =Castle|first=Stephen|publisher=[[The Independent]]|title=After 13 years of hold-ups and incompetence, the EU's 'Berlaymonster' rises like a phoenix.|date=[[2004-08-05]]|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article50224.ece|accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref> The Commission is divided into departments known as [[Directorate-General|Directorates-General]] (DGs) that can be likened to departments or [[Ministry (government department)|ministries]]. Each covers a specific policy area or service such as External relations or Translation and is headed by Director-General who is responsible to a Commissioner. A Commissioner's portfolio can be supported by numerous DGs, they prepare proposals for them and if approved by a majority of Commissioners it goes forward to Parliament and Council for consideration.<ref>{{cite web|title = Eurojargon.|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://europa.eu/abc/eurojargon/index_en.htm|accessdate=2007-06-18}}</ref><ref name="Europa Institutions"/>

According to figures published by the Commission, 23,043 persons were employed by the Commission as officials and temporary agents in April 2007. In addition to these, 9019 "external staff" (e.g. Contractual agents, detached national experts, young experts etc) were employed. The single largest DG is the [[Directorate-General for Translation (European Commission)|Directorate-General for Translation]], with a 2186-strong staff, while the largest group by nationality is [[Belgium|Belgian]] (21.4 %), probably due to a majority (16,626) of staff being based in the country.<ref>{{cite web|title=Civil Service: Staff figures.|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://ec.europa.eu/civil_service/about/figures/index_en.htm |accessdate=2007-06-18}}</ref> The Commission's civil service is headed by a [[Secretary-General of the European Commission|Secretary General]], currently [[Catherine Day]].<ref name="Day"/>

Communication with the press is handled by the [[Directorate-General Communication (European Commission)|Directorate-General Communication]]. The Commission's chief [[spokesperson]] is Johannes Laitenberger who takes the midday [[Mass media|press]] briefings, commonly known as the "Midday Presser". It takes place every weekday in the Commission's press room at the Berlaymont where journalists may ask questions of Commission officials on any topic and legitimately expect to get an "on the record" answer for live TV. Such a situation is unique in the world.<ref>{{cite web|last =Lynam|first=Joe|title=The peculiar world of the European Union|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=[[2007-04-01]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6496813.stm|accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref> There is a greater number of press corps in Brussels than [[Washington D.C.]]; media outlets in every Union member-state have a Brussels [[correspondent]].<ref>{{cite journal|last = Parker|first = John|title = A tale of two cities|journal = E!Sharp magazine|pages = 42–44|date = January - February 2007|publisher = Encompass Publications }}</ref>

==Legitimacy==
It is argued by some that the method of appointment for the Commission increases the [[democratic deficit in the European Union]].<ref>{{cite web|last =Mulvey|first=Stephan|title = The EU's democratic challenge| publisher =[[BBC News]]|date=[[2003-11-21]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3224666.stm |accessdate = 2007-08-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last =|first=|title = Democratic deficit| publisher =[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/democratic_deficit_en.htm|accessdate = 2007-08-27}}</ref> While the Commission is the executive branch, the candidates are chosen primarily by the 27 national governments, meaning it is hard for the Commission to be thrown out directly by the voters. The legitimacy of the Commission is mainly drawn from the vote of approval that is required from the Parliament along with Parliament's power to sack the body, however there has been less than 50% turnout in the Parliament's elections [[European Parliament election, 1999|since 1999]]. While higher than some national elections, including the [[US Congress]], the fact that there are no direct elections to the Commission President like in the US makes the post less legitimate in the eyes of the public.<ref>{{cite web|last =Mulvey|first=Stephen|title = The EU's democratic challenge| publisher =[[BBC News]]|date=[[2003-11-21]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3224666.stm |accessdate = 2007-06-17}}</ref> A further problem is the lack of a coherent electorate, even though democratic structures and methods are developing there is not such a mirror in creating a European [[civil society]].<ref>{{cite web|last =Lamming|first=Richard|title = The democratic credentials of the new European Union: does the Constitution increase the EU's democratic legitimacy?| publisher =[[Federal Union]]|date=[[2004-09-10]]|url=http://www.federalunion.org.uk/europe/democraticcredentials.shtml |accessdate = 2007-06-17}}</ref> The new Reform Treaty could go some way to resolving the deficit in creating greater democratic controls on the Commission, including enshrining the procedure of linking elections to the selection of the Commission president.<ref>{{cite web|publisher = [[Europa (web portal)]]|title = Glossary: Democratic deficit.|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/democratic_deficit_en.htm |accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref> Under the plans of Vice President Wallström, [[European political parties]] would gain greater prominence and could lead to the Commission President being elected via the [[Elections in the European Union|Parliament's elections]].<ref>{{cite web|last = Mahony |first=Honor|title = European politics to get more political| publisher =EU Observer|date=[[2007-06-27]]|url=http://euobserver.com/9/24370 |accessdate = 2007-06-27}}</ref>

The alternative viewpoint on the Commission states that the policy areas in which it has power to initiate legislation are ill suited to an institution accountable to electoral pressures. In this respect the Commission has been compared with institutions such as independent [[Central Bank]]s which deal with technical areas of policy that are of little electoral salience. In addition some defenders of the Commission point out that legislation must be approved by the Council in all areas (the ministers of member states) and the European Parliament in some areas before it can be adopted, thus the amount of legislation which is adopted in any one country without the approval of its government is limited.<ref>{{cite journal |quotes= |last=Majone |first=Giandomenico |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |month= |title=Perils of Parliamentarization |journal=Governance |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=375 |id= |url= |accessdate= }}</ref>

==Future of the Commission==
The proposed [[Reform Treaty]], the details of which were agreed in June 2007, largely retains the reforms outlined in the rejected [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|Constitutional Treaty]].<ref>{{cite web|last = Council of the European Union|title = Brussels European Council 21/22 June 2007: Presidency Conclusions |date=[[2007-06-20]]|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressData/en/ec/94932.pdf|accessdate = 2007-06-22 }}</ref> The constitution's reforms proposed a number of changes, notably the number of Commissioners would be reduced; from [[2014]] only two out of three member-states would have the right to representation. The representation would be rotated equally between all states and  no state would have more than two in any single Commission. The Commission would also include the new [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy]], as one of the Vice Presidents, replacing the [[European Commissioner for External Relations|External Relations Commissioner]]. The High Representative would have been called the "Union Foreign Minister" – the first time a member of the Commission held the common national title of "Minister". In the appointment of the Commission, the most recent European elections would have to be taken into account. It is thought this would create a stronger link between the elections and the Commission, however the President would still be proposed by the Council. Although when the Parliament votes on the Commission, the treaty changes the term "approve" to "elect" in referring to the vote: it is unknown yet if this will produce practical change.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Union's institutions: Commission|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/constitution/commission_en.htm|accessdate=2007-07-06}}</ref>
