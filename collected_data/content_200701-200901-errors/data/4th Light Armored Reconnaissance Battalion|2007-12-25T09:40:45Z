==History==
===The 1980s and 1990s===

The 4th Light Armored Vehicle Battalion was activated on September 23, 1987.  From December 26,1990 to April 24, 1991 deployed to the Kingdom of [[Saudi Arabia]] as part of [[Operation Desert Shield]] and [[Operation Desert Storm]].  The Battalion's assets were spread out over hundreds of miles of desert terrain and were utilized by the Marine Command to constantly probe the boundaries of Iraqi controlled areas.  The Battalion executed Reconnaissance and Counter Reconnaissance Operations, emergency extraction of friendly forces, breaching of berms and minefields along the Iraqi and [[Kuwait]] border and prisoner capture and control.
On October 1,1996 the battalion was re-designated as the 4th Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion.

===Global War on Terror===

From [[February 24]], [[2003]] to [[September 16]], [[2003]], 4th LAR deployed to [[Iraq]] in support of [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] (OIF).  Alpha and Bravo companies were mobilized in early February 2003 and deployed with [[1st Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion|1st]] and [[3rd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion|3rd LAR]] Battalions  respectively, participating in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].  The remainder of the battalion was activated in early March 2003 and quickly deployed to Iraq.

In May 2003 the battalion was reconstituted as a whole and conducted surveillance and reconnaissance operations along the Iraq/Iran Border.  On [[June 2]], [[2003]] the battalion moved to the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]] HQ, located in [[Al Hilla]] to act as the Division [[Quick Reaction Force|quick reaction force]].  Bravo Company was based in Ad Diwaniyah, and generally conducted missions separately from the rest of the battalion.  On [[June 13]], 2003 Task Force Scorpion was activated and moved to the Northern [[Babil]] province with orders to secure Army convoy routes in and out of [[Forward Operating Base]] Dogwood.  The core of Task Force Scorpion was initially formed around 4th Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion, consisting initially of H&S and Alpha Companies, 4th LAR; Co C, [[1st Battalion 4th Marines]], two platoons from [[Force Reconnaissance]]; an [[Bomb disposal|Explosive Ordinance Disposal]] (EOD) detachment; and elements of [[Radio Battalion]].   The Task Force was later reinforced with Delta Company and two other active duty infantry companies from [[1st Battalion 7th Marines]].  Task Force Scorpion's offensive posture and heavy patrolling effectively reduced the number of attacks on American soldiers in the area. <ref>{{cite web

Since OIF I, Marines from the battalion have continued to support on-going combat and security operations associated with the Global War on Terror.  Several Marines returned to Iraq with the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]], serving as members of the Division Commander's Personal Security Detachment and as military advisers to Iraqi infantry units.  In 2006, members of Co A and H&S Company were mobilized and formed the 4th Provisional Security Company and deployed to the [[Horn of Africa]].  Also Co B was mobilized and returned to Iraq on [[October 11]], [[2006]] to serve '''Dam Security Unit-3''' conducting riverine reconnaissance, support, and security operations from [[Al-Qa'im]] to [[Fallujah]].  They returned to the United States on [[April 1]], [[2007]]. <ref>{{cite web
