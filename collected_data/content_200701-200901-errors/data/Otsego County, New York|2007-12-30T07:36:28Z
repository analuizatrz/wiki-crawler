In 1789, [[Ontario County, New York|Ontario County]] was split off from Montgomery. The actual area split off from [[Montgomery County, New York| Montgomery County]] was much larger than the present county, also including the present [[Allegany County, New York|Allegany]], [[Cattaraugus County, New York|Cattaraugus]], [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua]], [[Erie County, New York|Erie]], [[Genesee County, New York|Genesee]], [[Livingston County, New York|Livingston]], [[Monroe County, New York|Monroe]], [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara]], [[Orleans County, New York|Orleans]], [[Steuben County, New York|Steuben]], [[Wyoming County, New York|Wyoming]], [[Yates County, New York|Yates]], and part of [[Schuyler County, New York|Schuyler]] and [[Wayne County, New York|Wayne Counties]].

=== The formation of Otsego County === 
Otsego County was one of three counties split off from Montgomery (the other two being [[Herkimer County, New York|Herkimer]], and [[Tioga County, New York|Tioga County]]).  Otsego county was officially established on [[February 16]], [[1791]], with Cooperstown as its county seat, even though the village of Cherry Valley was at the time much larger.  The original county consisted of three large [[townships]]:
*[[Cherry Valley, New York|Cherry Valley]] in the northeast,
*[[Otsego, New York|Otsego]] in the northwest, and
*[[Harpersfield, New York|Harpersfield]] in the south.

Otsego and Cherry Valley together roughly covered the area of modern Otsego County, while Harpersfield covered the area south of the current county, as far as the [[Delaware River]].

The original appointments to Otsego County government positions, made by [[George Clinton (politician)|Governor George Clinton]] included:
* [[Richard R. Smith]], county sheriff, from the Otsego township,
* [[Jacob Morris]], county clerk, from the Otsego township,
* [[William Cooper (judge)|William Cooper]], chief judge, from the Otsego township,
* [[Jedediah Peck]], associate justice from the Otsego township,
* [[Edward Griswold]], associate justice from Cherry Valley
* [[Platt Townsend]], associate justice from Harpersfield,
* [[Alexander Harper]], commander of the county militia, from Harpersfield.

=== The founding of new towns === 
By 1793, four towns had been added to the county by division of the existing towns:
*The Otsego township had been divided into the towns of:
**[[Burlington, New York|Burlington]] in the west,
**[[Otsego, New York|Otsego]] in the northeast,
**[[Richfield, New York|Richfield]] in the north, and
**[[Unadilla (town), New York|Unadilla]] in the south.
*Harpersfield had been divided into the towns of:
**[[Franklin (town), New York|Franklin]] in the west and
**[[Harpersfield, New York|Harpersfield]] in the east.

=== Areas of Otsego County used to form new counties === 
The area of Otesgo County was reduced by a number of subsequent splits.

In 1795, a piece of Otsego County was joined with a portion taken from [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]] to create [[Schoharie County, New York|Schoharie County]].

In 1797, a piece of Otsego County was joined with a portion taken from [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster County]] to create [[Delaware County, New York|Delaware County]].

==Geography==
Otsego County is in central New York State, to the west of [[Albany, New York|Albany]], southeast of [[Utica, New York|Utica]], and northeast of [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]].  The county is considered by some to belong to the [[Southern Tier]] region of New York State.

According to the [[United States Census 2000|2000 census]], the county has a total area of 1,015&nbsp;[[square mile]]s (2,629&nbsp;[[km²]]), of which, 1,003&nbsp;square miles (2,597&nbsp;km²) of it is land and 12&nbsp;square miles (32&nbsp;km²) of it (1.21%) is water.
