'''''Hot Fuzz''''' is a [[2007 in film|2007]] [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British]] police [[action film|action]]/[[comedy film|comedy]] film written by [[Simon Pegg]] and [[Edgar Wright]], known for the motion picture ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'' and the television series ''[[Spaced]]''. It was directed by [[Edgar Wright]] and produced by [[Nira Park]]. 

==Plot==

<!-- Move information that isn't so important to the Cast section to describe characters, ala the Star Wars/Lord of the Rings articles.-->

Nicholas Angel ([[Simon Pegg]]), an extremely dedicated and over-achieving [[police officer]] in [[London]]'s [[Metropolitan Police Service]], is so good that he makes everyone else on the service look bad. As a result his superiors send him to a place where his talents won’t be quite so embarrassing: the sleepy and seemingly crime-free [[village]] of Sandford, where there hasn't been a recorded murder for twenty years. Once there, he is partnered with well-meaning but overeager and naive police constable Danny Butterman ([[Nick Frost]]), the son of local police chief Inspector Frank Butterman. A committed action movie fan, Danny is in awe of his new big-city partner, believing him to be a real-life "[[Bad Boys II|bad boy]]" who just might provide him with his chance to experience the life of gunfights and car chases he so longs for. Angel, meanwhile, struggles to adjust to the quiet and uneventful pace of the village, and despite clearing up several otherwise unnoticed [[crime]]s and [[misdemeanor]]s in short order (such as shoplifters, underage drinkers and a farmer storing a huge supply of illegal weapons in his barn), soon finds his most pressing concern being a [[swan]] that has escaped from its owner. Faced with the reality of his situation, Angel and Danny eventually bond over drinks at the local pub and action movies.

Soon after Angel's arrival, a series of grisly "accidents" rock the village, seemingly committed by a cloaked and hooded individual. Increasingly convinced that Sandford is not what it seems, Angel begins to clash with the other officers on the force, in particular the two detectives who believe that he's nothing more than an uptight city cop with an overactive imagination. However, Angel refuses to drop the investigation and initially suspects Simon "Sissy"  Skinner, the charming but sinister manager of the local [[Somerfield (UK retailer)|Somerfield]] supermarket, of murdering the victims due to their involvement in a lucrative property deal.  His confrontation with Skinner only reveals Skinner's apparent innocence and further damages Angel's credibility with his colleagues. After being ambushed in his hotel room by the cloaked murderer, who is unmasked as the giant trolley boy of the Somerfield supermarket under the instruction of Skinner, Angel is led to a nearby castle where he discovers the truth&mdash;Inspector Butterman and the Neighbourhood Watch Alliance (NWA), intent on keeping Sandford's title of "Village of the Year", have been murdering anyone who may potentially damage the village's image. Angel discovers the bodies of various "problem" people whom the NWA have disposed of (several of whom Angel had encountered earlier in the movie), before being cornered and stabbed by Danny, apparently a member of the NWA.

Angel is not harmed, however; having tricked the NWA into believing that Angel is dead, Danny instead drives him to the village limits and releases him, insisting that he knew nothing about their true activities. Danny urges Angel to flee, reasoning that no-one would believe the truth about Sandford. However, while at a rest stop Angel sees the two movies he and Danny bonded over on a nearby sales rack (''[[Point Break]]'' and ''[[Bad Boys II]]'') and is inspired to stop the NWA once and for all; to that end, he drives back to town and arms himself with the confiscated weapons seized earlier in the movie. After Angel meets with Danny in the village, the two begin to dispatch the members of the NWA in an increasingly destructive and frantic series of gun fights. Initially confronted by the Sandford Police Service, Angel and Danny quickly persuade their colleagues of the truth and take the battle to the supermarket. Skinner and Inspector Butterman flee, and are pursued by Angel and Danny to a nearby model village, where both are eventually subdued. Although Angel's old supervisors arrive from London begging Angel to return, as their crime statistics have risen drastically whilst he has been gone seemingly as a result of his absence, Angel elects to remain in Sandford. Back at the police station, the Sandford Police celebrate their triumph and attempt to complete their paperwork, but are ambushed by a remaining member of the NWA.  He attempts to shoot Angel but Danny jumps in front of the blast.  In the resulting chaos a confiscated [[naval mine]]  is triggered and the station is destroyed. The movie cuts to a year later, with Angel laying flowers on a grave marked 'Butterman'; it is revealed that Danny has survived, however, and that the grave is his mother's. Angel has been promoted to Inspector and Danny to Sergeant, and the film ends as they go back to working the beat together in Sandford.

==Production==
Director Edgar Wright and star Simon Pegg spent eighteen months writing the script.<ref>{{cite web | author = Joe Utichi | title = Countryside Commandoes | publisher = Rotten Tomatoes | date = [[2007-02-13]] | url = http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/click/movie-1164807/reviews.php?rid=1598617 | accessdate = 2007-02-13}}</ref> During the latter half of 2005, [[Working Title Films|Working Title]] approached several towns in [[South West England]] looking for an appropriate filming location. Simon Pegg commented "We're both from the [[West Country]] so it just seemed like it was the perfect and logical thing to drag those kind of ideas and those genres and those clichés back to our beginnings to where we grew up, so you could see high-octane balls-to-the-wall action in [[Frome]]".<ref name="culture">{{cite episode | title = Week Four 2007 | episodelink =  | series = The Culture Show | serieslink = The Culture Show | station = [[BBC 2]] | airdate = 2007-02-10}}</ref> 

[[Stow-on-the-Wold]] was considered amongst others, but after being turned away, the company settled upon [[Wells]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cotswoldjournal.co.uk/search/display.var.874709.0.thank_god_we_did_screen_film_event.php|title=Thank God we did screen film event|date=[[2006-08-11]]|publisher=Cotswold Journal}}</ref> Edgar Wright's hometown. Wright has commented "and Wells is very picturesque [...] I love it but I also want to trash it".<ref name="comedy map">{{cite episode | title = [http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedymap/episode2.shtml Episode 2 - Around the West Country and into Wales] | episodelink =  | series = The Comedy Map of Britain | serieslink =  | credits =  | network = [[BBC 2]] | station = | city =  | airdate = 2007-02-03}}</ref> Filming also took place at the [[Hendon Police College]], including the driving school skid pan and athletic track.<ref>[http://www.movielocationsguide.com/Hot_Fuzz/filming_locations List of locations used in Wells, Somerset]</ref>

Wright has said that it takes elements from his final amateur film ''Dead Right'', a film he described as both "''[[Lethal Weapon]]'' set in Somerset" and "a ''[[Dirty Harry]]'' film in Somerset".<ref name="comedy map">{{cite episode | title = [http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedymap/episode2.shtml Episode 2 - Around the West Country and into Wales] | episodelink =  | series = The Comedy Map of Britain | serieslink =  | credits =  | network = [[BBC 2]] | station = | city =  | airdate = 2007-02-03}}</ref>
He uses some of the same locations in both films including the Somerfield supermarket, where he used to work as a shelf-stacker.<ref name="comedy map">{{cite episode | title = [http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedymap/episode2.shtml Episode 2 - Around the West Country and into Wales] | episodelink =  | series = The Comedy Map of Britain | serieslink =  | credits =  | network = [[BBC 2]] | station = | city =  | airdate = 2007-02-03}}</ref>

The film parodies clichés used in other action movies. On the topic of perceived gun fetishes in these movies, Pegg has said "Men can't do that thing, which is the greatest achievement of humankind, which is to make another human, so we make metal versions of our own penises and fire more bits of metal out of the end into peoples heads [...] It's our turn to grab the gun by the hilt and fire it into your face".<ref name="culture">{{cite episode | title = Week Four 2007 | episodelink =  | series = The Culture Show | serieslink = The Culture Show | station = [[BBC 2]] | airdate = 2007-02-10}}</ref> Despite this, Pegg maintains that the film is not a spoof in that, '"They lack the sneer that a lot of parodies have that look down on their source material. Because we're looking up to it."<ref>{{cite news | author = Clark Collis | title = Brits and Giggles | publisher = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = [[2007-04-13]] | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20034733,00.html | accessdate=2007-04-17}}</ref> The film was scored by [[David Arnold]] (well known for his [[2006 in music|2006]]  ''[[Casino Royale (2006 soundtrack)|''Casino Royale'']] soundtrack).

Filming commenced on [[March 19]], [[2006]],<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.workingtitlefilms.com/newsArticle.php?newsID=115 | title=Filming under way on Hot Fuzz | publisher=Working Title Films | date=[[2006-03-20]]}}</ref> and lasted for 11 weeks.<ref name="channel4">{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/apps26/film/reviews/film.jsp?section=indepth&id=159113&page=3|title=Hot Fuzz|publisher=[[Channel 4]]}}</ref> Throughout the filming process Pegg, Frost and Wright recorded a regular [[video blog]] which is available on the ''Hot Fuzz'' section of the Working Title website. Wright cut half an hour from the film.<ref>{{cite news|author=Patrick Kolan|title=Interview With Edgar Wright|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=[[2007-03-13]]|url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/772/772635p1.html|accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref> Advanced screenings of the film took place on the [[14 February]] [[2007]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and was fully released on  [[16 February]] [[2007]]. The film had a limited release in [[Canada]] and the [[USA]] on [[20 April]] [[2007]]. The film carries a 15 certificate in the UK and is rated 14A in Canada for gory scenes and coarse language and is rated R in the US for violent content including some graphic images, and language.

==Box office and critical reception==
The film generated £7.1 million in its first weekend of release in UK cinema.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6379441.stm|title=Hot Fuzz heats up UK box office|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=[[2007-02-20]]}}</ref>

Critically, the movie received positive reviews, and was rated almost as highly as their previous film ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/shaun_of_the_dead/|title=Shaun of the Dead|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref> It has a 89% fresh rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/hot_fuzz/|title=Hot Fuzz|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=2007-04-05}}</ref> and 8.4 on [[IMDB]], currently placing it at number 98 in its top 250 movies of all-time as voted for by its users.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425112/|title=Hot Fuzz|publisher=[[IMDB]]}}</ref> Olly Richards of ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' said of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost "After almost a decade together they’re clearly so comfortable in each other’s presence that they feel no need to fight for the punchline, making them terrific company for two hours".<ref>{{cite news | author = Olly Richards | title = Hot Fuzz | publisher = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | url = http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=10243 | accessdate=2007-02-23}}</ref> [[Johnny Vaughan]] of ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'' already called it the "most arresting Brit-com of 2007".<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Johnny Vaughan]]|title=The Plod Couple|publisher=[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]|date=[[2007-02-16]]|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2007070721,00.html|accessdate=2007-03-05}}</ref> Phillip French of ''[[The Observer]]'', who did not care for ''Shaun of the Dead'', warmed to the comedy team in this film.<ref>{{cite news|author=Phillip French|title=Hot Fuzz|publisher=[[The Observer]]|date=[[2007-02-18]]|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/Critic_Review/Observer_review/0,,2015564,00.html|accessdate=2007-03-05}}</ref> The film also received positive reviews stateside. Derek Elley of ''Variety'' praised Broadbent and Dalton, "[who] are especially good as Angel's hail-fellow-well-met superior and oily No. 1 suspect".<ref>{{cite news | author = Derek Elley | title = Hot Fuzz | publisher = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=[[2007-02-20]]|url = http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117932857.html?categoryid=31&cs=1 | accessdate=2007-02-23}}</ref>  As an homage to the genre, the film was well received by screenwriter [[Shane Black]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Patrick Kolan|title=Interview With Edgar Wright (page 2)|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=[[2007-03-13]]|url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/772/772635p2.html|accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref>

However, the ''[[The Daily Mirror]]'' only gave ''Hot Fuzz'' 2/5, stating that "many of the jokes miss their target" as the film becomes more action-based.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/showbiz/entertainment/movies/tm_headline=hot-fuzz%26method=full%26objectid=18621717%26siteid=89520-name_page.html|title=Hot Fuzz|work=[[Daily Mirror]]}}</ref> ''[[Daily Mail]]'' also shared ''The Mirror'''s view, saying that "It's the lack of any serious intent that means too much of it is desperately unamusing, and unamusingly desperate".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/reviews.html?in_article_id=436569&in_page_id=1924|title=It aims.

The film was met with a wealth of critical praise when it opened in the US on April 20, 2007. Currently, it has a high [[metacritic]] score of 81 [http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/hotfuzz].
It made $5.8 million in its opening weekend from only 825 theaters. ''Hot Fuzz'' also had the highest per-theater average of any film in the top ten that week. Its opening weekend take beat the $3.3 million opening weekend take of Pegg and Wright's previous film, ''Shaun Of The Dead''. In its second weekend of release, [[Rogue Pictures]] expanded the film's theater count from 825 to 1,272 and it grossed $4.9 million, representing a small 17% dip in the gross. As of [[May 13]][[2007]], ''Hot Fuzz'' has grossed $68,182,501. <ref>[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=hotfuzz.htm Box Office Mojo: HOT FUZZ]</ref>

==Cultural references==
Simon Pegg has said that "an awareness of the [[postmodern condition]] is still the intellectual bedrock" of his comedic method. <ref name="Interview">{{cite web|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,2005313,00.html|title=A Fair Cop |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''}}</ref> This is reflected in the large number of references to other films, TV and computer games featured in his work.

The film predominantly references and parodies action films. This is done in a number of ways, including references to scenes - Angel's collecting of guns from the evidence room plays on similar scenes in many action films, including, for example, ''[[Commando (film)|Commando]]'' and ''[[The Matrix (film)|The Matrix]]''.<ref name="Tooling Up">{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/features/hotfuzz/|title=Hot Fuzz Feature|publisher=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]}}</ref> In particular, the films ''[[Bad Boys II]]'' and ''[[Point Break]]'', watched by Angel and Butterman at one point in the film, are frequently referenced. Butterman's firing of his gun in the air in the final action scene is a direct reference to a scene of ''Point Break'' previously viewed by the characters in an earlier scene<ref name=avclub>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/60806/2|title="Nick Frost, Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright of 'Hot Fuzz'"|publisher=A.V Club}}</ref> In the aftermath as ambulances arrive, a low angle shot of Angel and Butterman matches one from ''Bad Boys'' when police helicopters arrive. The movie poster itself spoofs early promotional material for ''[[Bad Boys II]]''.{{Fact|date=April 2007}} Even the logo is a variation of the one found in the posters for the aforementioned film, and its predecessor ''[[Bad Boys (1995 film)|Bad Boys]]''.{{or}} Lines such as "This shit just got real" also refer to ''Bad Boys II''. Other films referenced through individual lines include ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' ("You've always been here"), ''[[Chinatown (film)|Chinatown]]'' ("Forget it, Nick. It's Sandford"), ''[[Men in Black (film)|Men in Black]]'' ("Now that's what I'm talking about") and ''[[He-Man]]'' (the repeated "By the power of [[Castle Grayskull|Grayskull]]"). Similarly, the action sequences refer to various police and thriller movies of note.  For example, ''[[Straw Dogs]]'' is referenced when Angel shoots the bear-trap down causing it close on the barkeeper's head, and ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'' is referenced when Frost opens the car trunk and looks down at Pegg.

Throughout the film, Angel carries a plant with him, that he cares for closely and has a near-personal bond with.  This is especially prevalent during the scenes where he is moving from London to Sandford, referencing the film Léon/The Professional where that film's main character also carries and cares for a plant.  

The film also shares similarity in plot and theme with films such as ''[[Straw Dogs]]'', ''[[The Wicker Man]]'', ''[[Scream (film)|Scream]]'' and ''[[The Frighteners]]''.{{or}}, and twice a character notes that the character Tom (a cameo role played by Edward Woodward) was an extra in ''Straw Dogs'' - in which Woodward starred.

Multiple nods to ''Shaun of the Dead'' are also made, including the fence-based short cut ("What's the matter Danny? Never taken a short cut before?"), but with a role reversal of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, the one-worded Cornetto requests, the way Angel and Danny describe some suspicious characters on the street, a pub slot machine jingle (Oo-ah-Dracula) heard in the 'Winchester', the product advertised in the pub; 'Hog Lumps' and the fact that Nick Frost's character shoots someone in the leg with an air rifle; where in Shaun, the rifle was thought to be deactivated but was not while in Hot Fuzz, it was thought the sea mine was also deactivated but was not. Most blatantly, the Spanish DVD release - with title of ''Zombies Party'' - is briefly seen in a supermarket bargain bin, with a price sticker covering Pegg's face.[[Image:HotFuzz-Zombies party.jpg|thumb|Zombies Party DVD]]

Also Danny Butterman wears a Bristol Rovers shirt in lots of bits of this film

There are several in-jokes with regards to police terminology. Some are explained in the film such as "Police Service, you can't call it a force - sounds too aggressive" where modernisation within the police has led to changes. Meanwhile the fictional town of Sandford is the name used by [[Centrex (police training agency)|Centrex]] for their genuine police promotion exercises.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/northwest/series2/police_village_chesire_training_crime_sandford_officers.shtml | title=Cheshire's Police Village | publisher=BBC | work=BBC Inside Out | accessdate=2007-03-09}}</ref>

The Neighbourhood Watch Association has the acronym [[N.W.A.]], with possible reference to the music group.  They are also referenced in the first line of one of the songs in the credits, "straight outta Sandford," referring to N.W.A.'s [[Straight Outta Compton]].

In an interview, when asked about the title of ''Hot Fuzz'', Wright called it "pure nonsense".

==DVD==
The DVD is scheduled for release on [[11 June]] 2007 in the UK and Ireland. The known special features include around thirty minutes of extra features, interviews, making of/behind the scenes, four audio commentaries (Edgar, Pegg and Frost; the Sandford Police force; the Sandford Village People; and the Real Fuzz) and some hidden [[Easter egg (virtual)|easter eggs]]. The DVD will also feature Wright's last amateur film ''Dead Right'' which he described as "Hot Fuzz without the budget".
