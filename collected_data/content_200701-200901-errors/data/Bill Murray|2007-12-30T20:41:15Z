During the filming of ''Stripes'', Murray wed Margaret "Mickey" Kelly on [[Super Bowl]] Sunday in [[Las Vegas]] on [[January 24]], [[1981]].<ref name= "chase"/><ref name= "white"/> They married again in Chicago in a church for their families.<ref name= "chase"/> They had two sons, Homer (born 1982) and Luke (born 1985), before divorcing in 1994.

Very detached from the [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] scene, Murray does not have an agent or manager and reportedly only fields offers for scripts and roles using a personal telephone number with a voice mailbox that he checks infrequently.{{Fact|date=November 2007}} This practice has the downside of sometimes preventing him from taking parts that he had auditioned for and was interested in, such as that of Sulley in ''[[Monsters, Inc]]'' and [[Willy Wonka]] in ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]].''{{Fact|date=November 2007}}

Murray has homes in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[Martha's Vineyard, MA|Martha's Vineyard, MA]], [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston, SC]], and [[Rockland County, New York]], just outside of New York City.{{Fact|date=November 2007}}

===''Saturday Night Live''===
In 1975, an Off Broadway version of a ''Lampoon'' show led to his first television role as a cast member of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[variety show]] ''[[Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell]]'' that featured animal acts and little kids with loud voices.<ref name= "chase"/> That same season, another variety show titled ''NBC's Saturday Night'' premiered. Cosell's show lasted just one season. 

After working in [[Los Angeles]] with the "guerrilla video" commune [[TVTV]] on a number of projects, Murray rose to prominence when he replaced [[Chevy Chase]] on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.

===Films===

Murray landed his first starring role with the film ''[[Meatballs (film)|Meatballs]]'' in 1979. He followed this up with his portrayal of famed writer [[Hunter S. Thompson]] in 1980's ''[[Where the Buffalo Roam]]''. In the early [[1980s]], he starred in a string of box-office hits including ''[[Caddyshack]]'', ''[[Stripes (film)|Stripes]]'' and ''[[Tootsie]]''. 

Murray began work on a [[film adaptation]] of the novel ''[[The Razor's Edge]]''. The film, which Murray also co-wrote,  was his first starring role in a [[dramatic film]]. He later agreed to star in ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' in a role originally written for [[John Belushi]]. This was a deal Murray made with [[Columbia Pictures]] in order to gain financing for his film.{{Fact|date=November 2007}} ''Ghostbusters'' became the highest-grossing film of 1984. But ''[[The Razor's Edge (1984 film)|The Razor's Edge]]'', which was filmed before ''Ghostbusters'' but not released until after, was a box-office flop. 

Upset over the failure of ''Razor's Edge'', Murray took four years off from acting to study philosophy and history at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], frequent the Cinematheque in Paris, and spend time with his family in their [[Hudson River Valley]] home.<ref name= "carr"/> During that time, his second son, Luke, was born.<ref name= "white"/> With the exception of a [[cameo appearance]] in the [[1986 in film|1986]] movie ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (1986 film)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'', he did not make any appearances in films, though he did participate in several public readings in [[Manhattan]] organized by playwright/director [[Timothy Mayer]] and in a production of [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s ''A Man's Man''.<ref name= "white"/>

Murray returned to films in 1988 with ''[[Scrooged]]'' and the sequel ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'' in 1989. In 1990, Murray made his first and only attempt at directing when he co-helmed ''[[Quick Change]]'' with producer [[Howard Franklin]]. His subsequent films ''[[What About Bob?]]'' (1991) and ''[[Groundhog Day (film)|Groundhog Day]]'' (1993) were box-office hits and critically acclaimed.

After a string of films that did not do well with audiences, he received much critical acclaim for [[Wes Anderson]]'s ''[[Rushmore (film)|Rushmore]]'' for which he won several awards. Murray then experienced a resurgence in his career as a dramatic actor. After dramatic roles in ''[[Wild Things]]'', ''[[Cradle Will Rock]]'', ''[[Hamlet (2000 movie)|Hamlet]]'' (as [[Polonius]]), and ''[[The Royal Tenenbaums]]'', he garnered considerable acclaim for the [[2003 in film|2003]] film ''[[Lost in Translation (film)|Lost in Translation]]''. He received a [[Golden Globe Award]] and a [[BAFTA]] award. He was also nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]], in what was considered{{Who|date=November 2007}} to be a two-horse race between him and [[Sean Penn]], who eventually prevailed. In an interview included on the ''Lost in Translation'' DVD, Murray states that this is his favorite movie in which he has appeared. 

[[Image:MurrayTable.jpg|thumb|200px|Bill Murray as Don Johnston in ''Broken Flowers''.]]
During this time, Murray still appeared in comedic roles such as ''[[Charlie's Angels (film)|Charlie's Angels]]'' and ''[[Osmosis Jones]]''. In 2004, he provided the voice of [[Garfield]] in ''[[Garfield (film)|Garfield: The Movie]]'' and marked his third collaboration with Wes Anderson in ''[[The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou]]''. his dramatic role in [[Jim Jarmusch]]'s ''[[Broken Flowers]]'' was also well received.

In 2005, he announced{{Fact|date=November 2007}} that he would take a break from acting, as he had not had the time since his new breakthrough in the late-[[1990s]]. He did return to the big screen, however, in a small role in Wes Anderson's ''[[The Darjeeling Limited]]''. 

[[Dan Aykroyd]] has recently confirmed in an interview with CISN Country that Murray will be reprising his role as the voice of Dr. Peter Venkman in ''[[Ghostbusters III]]''.<ref>http://www.cisnfm.com/station/blog_mike_mcguire.cfm?bid=7500</ref>

===Golf-related work===
Murray is an avid golfer who often plays in celebrity tournaments.  His [[1999 in literature|1999]] book ''Cinderella Story: My Life in Golf'', part [[autobiography]] and part [[essay]], expounds on his love of golf. In 2002, he and his brothers starred in the [[Comedy Central]] series, ''[[The Sweet Spot]]'', which chronicled their adventures playing golf.

While at a Golf Tournament with British golfer Ian Poulter, both men walked past a student party at the local university and proceeded to enter the building, wash the dishes and leave again in a bizarre manner, typical of Murray.{{Fact|date=December 2007}}

===Outside of show business===
He is a partner with his brothers in Murray Bros. Caddy Shack, a restaurant chain with locations near [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]] and in [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina|Myrtle Beach]] and [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]].<ref>[http://www.murraybroscaddyshack.com/ Murray Bros. Caddyshack Restaurant]</ref> 

He is a part-owner of the [[St. Paul Saints]] independent minor-league [[baseball]] team and occasionally travels to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] to watch the team's games.<ref>[http://www.saintsbaseball.com/staff/ownership/ St. Paul Saints ownership]</ref>  He also owns part of the [[Charleston RiverDogs]], [[Hudson Valley Renegades]], and the [[Brockton Rox]]. He invested in a number of other minor league teams in the past, including the [[Utica Blue Sox]], Miami Miracle, and Salt Lake Trappers. He was also a part-owner of the Auburn Astros (now the [[Auburn Doubledays]]) in Auburn, NY.
He has a glass of milk before bed every night.
