'''Hurricane Danny''' was the fourth tropical storm and second hurricane of the [[2003 Atlantic hurricane season]]. Forming from a [[tropical wave]] at a high latitude on [[July 16]], Danny initially was not expected to strengthen past minimal storm intensity. However, as the storm followed a large loop-like path over the north [[Atlantic Ocean]], it reached hurricane intensity on [[July 19]] at an unusually high latitude and in an area of higher than normal pressures. After maintaining its strength for 24 hours, the convection quickly diminished as the storm moved over cooler water temperatures, and Danny degenerated to a remnant area of low pressure. The system turned to the southwest and west, and it dissipated on [[July 27]] 630 miles (1,015 km) east of where the storm originally formed. Danny did not affect land and resulted in no injuries or fatalities. 

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Danny 2003 track.png}}
A large and well-organized [[tropical wave]] moved off the coast of Africa on [[July 9]]. Due to cooler waters the wave weakened as it tracked northwestward, and by the next day it was devoid of deep convection. On [[July 13]], deep convection developed near a mid-level circulation along the wave vorticy, and the convection slowly organized and increased over the following days. [[Dvorak technique|Dvorak classifications]] began late on [[July 15]], and based satellite imagery and ship reports of a closed surface circulation, the system developed into Tropical Depression Five on [[July 16]] about 630 miles (1,015 km) east of [[Bermuda]].<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|title=Tropical Cyclone Report: Hurricane Danny|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=August 12|accessyear=2006|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2003danny.shtml?}}</ref>

The depression quickly developed outer [[rainbands|banding features]] as the convection organized, and the system strengthened into Tropical Storm Danny early on [[July 17]]. The storm moved steadily northwestward around the edge of the Bermuda-Azores [[High pressure area]] in the central [[Atlantic Ocean]], and as it moved around its periphery its motion turned to the northeast on [[July 18]]. Despite being at a high latitude, Danny continued to strengthen over unusually warm water temperatures.<ref name="tcr"/> Based on the formation of a 17-mile (27-km) wide [[eye (cyclone)|eye]],<ref name="dannydisc11">{{cite web|author=Beven|year=2003|title=Hurricane Danny Discussion Eleven|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-10-11|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2003/dis/al052003.discus.011.shtml?}}</ref> it is estimated the storm attained hurricane status late on July 18 while located 525 miles (850 km) south of [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador]]. Due to the storm forming at a high latitude, Danny was embedded within a higher than average surrounding pressure field, and as a result the minimum central pressure was an unusually high 1000 [[Bar (unit)|mbar]].<ref name="tcr"/>

Despite moving over cooler waters and into an area of higher vertical [[wind shear]], Danny maintained minimal hurricane status for 24 hours<ref name="dannydisc13">{{cite web|author=Avila|year=2006|title=Hurricane Danny Discussion Thirteen|accessdate=2006-10-11|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2003/dis/al052003.discus.013.shtml?}}</ref> until late on [[July 19]] when it weakened to a tropical storm. Continuing around the northern periphery of the Bermuda-Azores high, Danny turned to the east and east-southeast into an area of cooler waters, resulting in rapid weakening. The storm deteriorated into a tropical depression on [[July 20]], and on [[July 21]] Danny degenerated into a remnant area of low pressure. The low turned southward and southwestward into an area of warmer water temperatures, and after executing a small loop on [[July 24]] the system developed deep convection over the center. However, large quantities of dry air prevented re-development of the storm. On [[July 27]], the remnant low dissipated about 1,240 miles (2,000 km) east of [[Bermuda]], or about 630 miles (1,015 km) east of where Danny first developed.<ref name="tcr"/>

===Predictions===
[[Image:Hurricane Danny (2003).jpg|right|thumb|Hurricane Danny while located to the southeast of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]]]
The tropical depression that was to become Danny was not originally forecast to strengthen into a tropical storm,<ref name="td4disc1">{{cite web|author=Avila|year=2003|title=Tropical Depression Four Discussion one|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-08-12|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2003/dis/al052003.discus.001.shtml?}}</ref> yet defied forecasts to become not only a tropical storm but also a hurricane. A narrow region of unusually high sea-surface temperatures (27°C - 27.5°C, 80.6°F - 81.5°F) was responsible for the intensification at a relatively high latitude.<ref name="tcr"/> The NHC was accurate in predicting Danny's movement clockwise around the subtropical ridge.<ref name="td4disc1"/>

Later in the forecast period as Danny was weakening, the NHC also discussed the possibility of Danny reintensifying as it moved south into a region of warmer sea-surface temperatures and less vertical wind shear. However, such a possibility was not considered likely due to the expectation that Danny would be too weak to regenerate by that point.<ref name=NHC-disc10@>{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|title=Discussion for Hurricane Danny, 5:00 p.m. EDT, July 18 2003|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=September 21|accessyear=2006|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2003/dis/al052003.discus.010.shtml?}}</ref>

==Impact and records==
Hurricane Danny did not affect any land areas and there were no reports of damage or fatalities. Early in its life, Danny moved in a direction towards [[Bermuda]], though a high pressure system forced the system to turn northward well to the east of the island. The hurricane entered the [[Canadian Hurricane Centre]]'s response zone, though tropical storm winds were not reported in Canadian waters.<ref name="wmo">{{cite web|author=World Meteorological Organization|year=2004|title=Final Report of the 2003 Hurricane Season|accessdate=2006-10-09|url=http://www.wmo.ch/web/www/TCP/Reports/HC26-English.pdf}}</ref> The Canadian Hurricane Centre issued a gale warning for the southern half of the southeastern [[Grand Banks]],<ref name="chccampbell">{{cite web|author=Campbell|year=2003|title=Canadian Tropical Storm Information Statement on Tropical Storm Danny|publisher=Canadian Hurricane Centre|accessdate=2006-10-11|url=http://www.atl.ec.gc.ca/weather/hurricane/bulletins/20030718000700.Danny.txt.en}}</ref> though it was cancelled after gale force winds were no longer expected.<ref name="chcfc">{{cite web|author=Fogarty/Campbell|year=2003|title=Canadian Hurricane Information Statement on Hurricane Danny|publisher=Canadian Hurricane Cantre|accessdate=2006-10-11|url=http://www.atl.ec.gc.ca/weather/hurricane/bulletins/20030719120700.Danny.txt.en}}</ref> Only one ship reported tropical storm force winds in association with Hurricane Danny; a ship on [[July 20]] recorded a west wind of 45 mph (72 km/h) while located 105 miles (170 km) south of the center. Because Danny stayed well out to sea, no warnings or watches were issued.<ref name="tcr"/>

At the time of when it became a tropical storm on [[July 17]], Danny was the third earliest for a season to produce four tropical storms, though it has since dropped to fourth. Danny became a hurricane at latitude 39.2° N, which is the furthest north a tropical cyclone has intensified into a hurricane before August.<ref name="hurdat">{{cite web|author=Hurricane Research Division|year=2006|title=Hurdat Data for Tropical Cyclones 1851-2005|publisher=[[NOAA]]|accessdate=2006-10-11|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/tracks1851to2005_atl.txt}}</ref>
