'''Trilobites''' ("three-lobes") are [[extinction|extinct]] [[arthropod]]s that form the [[class (biology)|class]] '''Trilobita'''. They appeared in the [[Early Cambrian]] period and flourished throughout the lower [[Paleozoic]] era before beginning a drawn-out decline to extinction when, during the [[Late Devonian extinction]], all trilobite orders, with the sole exception of [[Proetida]], died out. The last of the trilobites disappeared in the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event|mass extinction]] at the end of the [[Permian]] about 250 million years ago ([[mya (unit)|m.y.a.]]).

Trilobites are very well-known, and possibly the second-most famous fossil group, after the [[dinosaur]]s.  When trilobites appear in the [[fossil record]] of the Lower [[Cambrian]] they were already highly diverse and geographically dispersed. Because of their diversity and an easily [[fossilized]] exoskeleton, they left an extensive fossil record with some 17,000 known species spanning [[Paleozoic]] time. Trilobites have been important in [[biostratigraphy]], [[paleontology]], and [[plate tectonics]] research. For example, trilobites have been important in estimating the rate of [[speciation]] during the period known as the [[Cambrian Explosion]] because they are the most diverse group of [[metazoans]] known from the fossil record of the early Cambrian,<ref name=lieberman99>{{citation|last=Lieberman|first=BS|year=1999|title=Testing the Darwinian Legacy of the Cambrian Radiation Using Trilobite Phylogeny and Biogeography|journal=Journal of Paleontology|volume=73|issue=2}}</ref> and are readily distinguishable because of complex and well preserved morphologies.  The trilobites are often placed within the [[arthropod]] subphylum [[Schizoramia]] within the superclass [[Arachnomorpha]] (equivalent to the [[Arachnata]]),<ref name=cotton04>{{citation|last1=Cotton|first1=T.J.|first2=S.J.|last2=Braddy|year=2004|title=The phylogeny of arachnomorph arthropods and the origins of the Chelicerata|journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh: Earth Sciences|volume=94|pages=169–193|doi=10.1017/S0263593303000105}}</ref> although several alternative [[taxonomies]] are found in the literature.

Different trilobites made their living in different ways. Some led a [[benthic]] life as [[predators]], [[scavengers]] or filter feeders. Some swam (a [[Pelagic zone|pelagic]] lifestyle) and fed on [[plankton]]. Most life styles expected of modern marine arthropods are seen, except for parasitism.<ref name=Fortey05>{{citation |last1=Fortey |first1=Richard |year=2005 |title=The Lifestyles of the Trilobites  |journal=American Scientist. |volume=92 |pages=446-453}}</ref>
Some trilobites (particularly the family [[Olenida]]) are even thought to have evolved a [[symbiotic]] relationship with sulfur-eating bacteria from which they derived food.<ref name=Fortey00b>{{citation |last1=Fortey |first1=Richard |year=2000b |title=Olenid trilobites: The oldest known chemoautotrophic symbionts? |journal=Proc.

==Phylogeny==
Despite their rich fossil record with thousands of genera found throughout the world, the [[taxonomy]] and [[phylogeny]] of trilobites have many uncertainties. The systematic division of trilobites into nine distinct orders is represented by a widely held view that will inevitably change as new data emerge. Except possibly for the members of order [[Phacopida]], all trilobite orders appeared prior to the end of the Cambrian. Most scientists believe that order [[Redlichiida]], and more specifically its suborder [[Redlichiina]], contains a common ancestor of all other orders, with the possible exception of the [[Agnostina]]. While many potential phylogenies are found in the literature, most have suborder Redlichiina giving rise to orders [[Corynexochida]] and [[Ptychopariida]] during the Lower Cambrian, and the [[Lichida]] descending from either the Redlichiida or Corynexochida in the Middle Cambrian. Order [[Ptychopariida]] is the most problematic order for trilobite classification. In the 1959 Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology,<ref name=Treatise59>{{Citation |editor-last=Moore |editor-first=R.C. |title=Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology, Part O, Arthropoda 1, Trilobita |pages=''xix'' + 560 pp., 415 figs. |publisher=The Geological Society of America & The University of Kansas Press|place=Boulder, CO & Lawrence, KA |year = 1959 |isbn = 0-8137-3015-5}} </ref> what are now members of orders Ptychopariida, [[Asaphida]], [[Proetida]], and [[Harpetida]] were grouped together as order Ptychopariida; subclass [[Librostoma]] was erected in 1990<ref name=Fortey1990>{{citation|last1=Fortey|first1=R.A.|year=1990|title=Ontogeny, Hypostome attachment and Trilobite classification|journal=Palaeontology|volume=33 (3)|pages=529-576 |url=http://palaeontology.palass-pubs.org/pdf/Vol%2033/Pages%20529-576.pdf}} </ref> to encompass all of these orders, based on their shared ancestral character of a natant (unattached) [[hypostome]].

== Terminology ==
[[Image:SamGonIII 3lobes.png|frame|left|Fig 1. "Trilobite" (meaning "three-lobed") named for the three longitudinal lobes]]
[[Image:SamGonIII cepthopyg.png|frame|right|Fig. 2 The trilobite body is divided into three major sections.]]
As might be expected for a group of animals comprising 1,500+ genera and 17,000+ species the morphology and description of trilobites can be complex. "Trilobite" (meaning "three-lobed") is named for the three longitudinal lobes: a central axial lobe, and two symmetrical pleural lobes that flank the axis (Fig 1). The trilobite body is divided into three major sections, a cephalon (head) with eyes, mouth parts and antennae, a thorax of multiple similar segments (that in some species allowed enrollment), and a pygidium (tail), see Fig 2. When describing differences between different taxa of trilobites, the presence, size, and shape of the cephalic features are often mentioned and shown in Figs 3 & 4.

==Physical description==
When trilobites are found, only the exoskeleton is preserved (often in an incomplete state) in all but a handful of locations. A few locations ([[Lagerstaette| Lagerstätten]]) preserve identifiable soft body parts (legs, gills, musculature & digestive tract) and enigmatic traces of other structures (e.g. fine details of eye structure) as well as the exoskeleton. 

Trilobites range in length from 1 mm to 72 cm (1/25 inch to 28 inches), with a typical size range of 3 to 10 cm (1 to 4 inches). The world's largest trilobite, ''[[Isotelus]] rex'', was found in 1998 by Canadian scientists in Ordovician rocks on the shores of [[Hudson Bay]].<ref name="Rudkin03">{{citation||last1=Rudkin|first1=D.A.|last2= Young|first2=G.A.|last3=Elias|first3=R.J.|last4=Dobrzanske|first4=E.P.|year=2003|title=The World's biggest Trilobite: ''Isotelus rex'' new species from the Upper Ordovician of northern Manitoba, Canada|journal=Palaeontology|volume=70 (1)|pages=99–112

=== Exoskeleton ===
[[Image:Kainops invius lateral and ventral.JPG|thumb|left|''Kainops invius'' lateral and ventral view of exoskeleton showing hypostome and apodemes.]]

The [[exoskeleton]] is composed of [[calcite]] and calcium phosphate minerals in a protein lattice of [[chitin]] that covers the upper surface (dorsal) of the trilobite and curled round to produce a small fringe beneath called the doublure. The exoskeleton of trilobites are divided into three parts (''[[Tagma (biology)|tagmata]]''): a cephalon, composed of the two preoral and first four postoral segments completely fused together; a [[thorax]] composed of freely articulating segments; and a [[pygidium]] composed of the last segments fused together with the [[telson]]. 

During [[ecdysis|molting]], the exoskeleton generally split between the head and thorax, which is why so many trilobite fossils are missing one or the other. In most groups there were facial sutures on the cephalon to facilitate molting. 

[[Image:SamGonIII cranidium.png|thumb|200px|Fig. 3 - Morphology of the cephalon]]
[[Image:SamGonIII cephareas.png|thumb|200px|Fig. 4 - Detailed morphology of the cephalon]]
==== Cephalon ====
The cephalon of trilobites is highly variable with a lot of morphological complexity. The glabella forms a dome underneath which sat the "crop" or "stomach". The ventral surface of the cephalon often preserves muscle attachment scars and the presence of the hypostome, a small rigid plate upon which sat the mouth and stomach. The hypostome is highly variable, sometimes supported by a membrane (natant), sometimes fused onto the doublure with an outline very similar to the glabella above (conterminant) or fused to the doublure with an outline significantly different from the glabella (impendent). Many variations in shape and placement of the hyperstome have been described.<ref name=Fortey1990 /> Size of the glabella, lateral fringe and hypostome variation have all been linked to different lifestyles, diets and [[ecological niches]].<ref name=Fortey05 />
The fringe of the cephalon is greatly exaggerated in the [[Harpetida]], in other species a bulge in the pre-glabellar area is preserved that suggests a brood pouch.<ref
 name=Fortey98>{{citation |last1=Fortey |first1=R.A. |last2=Hughs |first2=N.C. |year=1998 |title=Brood pouches in trilobites |journal=Journal of Paleontology |volume=72 |pages=639–649 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3790/is_199807/ai_n8785182}} </ref>
Highly complex compound eyes are another obvious feature of the cephalon (see below). Figure 3 shows gross morphology of the cephalon. The cheeks (genae) are the pleural lobes on each side of the axial feature, the glabella. When trilobites molted or died, the librigenae (the so-called "free cheeks") often separated, leaving the cranidium (glabella + fixigenae) exposed.  Figure 4 shows a more detailed view of the cephalon.

==== Thorax ====
The thorax is s series of articulated segments that lie between the cephalon and pygidium. Number of segments varies between 2 and 61 with most species in the 2 to 16 range.<ref name=Whittington97a>{{Citation |last=Whittington |first=H.B. |author-link = |contribution=Morphology of the Exoskeleton. |editor-last=Kaesler |editor-first=R.L.

Each segment consists of the central axial ring and the outer plurae which protected the limbs and gills. The plurae are sometimes abbreviated to save weight or extended to form long spines. Apodemes are bulbous projections on the underside to which most leg muscles attached, athough some leg muscles attached directly to the exoskeleton.<ref name=Bruton03a>{{Citation |last1 = Bruton |first1=D.L. |last2=Haas |first2 =W. |contribution=Making Phacops come alive |editor-last=Lane, P.D., Siveter, D.J. & Fortey R.A.

Distinguishing where the thorax ends and the pygidium begins can be problematic and many segment counts suffer from this problem.<ref name=Whittington97a />
[[Image:Eldredgeops-rana-crassituberculata.jpg|thumb|left|An enrolled Phacopid trilobite ''Phacops rana crassituberculata''.]]
Fossilised trilobites are often found '''enrolled''' (curled up) like modern [[woodlice]] for protection. Some trilobites achieved a fully closed capsule (e.g. ''[[Phacops]]'') while others with long pleural spines (e.g. ''[[Selenopeltis]]'') or a small pygidium (e.g.  ''[[Paradoxides]]'') left a gap at the sides or between the cephalon and pygidium .<ref name=Whittington97a /> Even in an Agnostid, with only 2 articulating thoracic segments, the process of enrollment required a complex musculature to contract the exoskeleton and return to the flat condition.<ref name=Bruton&Nakrem05>{{citation |last1=Bruton |first1=D.L. |last2=Nakrem |first2=H.A. |year=2005 |title=Enrolment in a Middle Ordovician agnostoid trilobite. |journal=Acta Palaeontologica Polonica |volume=50(3) |pages=441–448 |url=http://www.nhm.uio.no/geomus/homepages/dokumenter/Acta_Pal_Polon_2005_Bruton_&_Nakrem_Agnostids.pdf}} </ref>
In ''[[Phacops]]'' the pleurae overlap a smooth bevel (facet) allowing a close seal with the doublure. The doublure carries a panderian notch or protuberance on each segment to prevent over rotation of each segment. Long lateral muscles extended from the cephalon to mid way down the pygidium, attaching to the axial rings allowing enrollment while separate muscles on the legs tucked them out of the way.<ref name=Bruton03a />

==== Pygidium ====
Is a number of segments and the telson fused together to form the tail. The pygidium segments are similar to the thoracic segments bearing legs and gills. Trilobites can be described based on the pydigium being micropygous (pydigium smaller than cephalon), isopygous (pydigium equal in size to cephalon), or macropygous (pydigium larger than cephalon).
==== Prosopon (surface sculpture) ====
Trilobite exoskeletons show a variety of small-scale structures collectively called [[prosopon]]. Prosopon does not include large scale extensions of the cuticle (e.g. hollow pleural spines) but to finer scale features, such as ribbing, domes, pustules, pitting, ridging and perforations. The exact purpose of the prosopon is not resolved but suggestions include structural strengthening, sensory pits or hairs, preventing predator attacks and maintaining aeration while enrolled.<ref name=Whittington97a />
In one example, alimentary ridge networks might have been either digestive or respiratory tubes in the cephalon and other regions.<ref name=Clarkson93>{{citation | last=Clarkson | first=E.N. | year=1993 | title=Invertebrate Paleontology and Evolution | edition=4th | publisher=Chapman/Hall | publication-place=New York}}</ref>  Later, more advanced trilobites developed thicker cuticles against predation by cephalopods.  This makes the prosopon harder to see. Alimentory prosopon are easily visible in the Cambrian fossil record from the thinner cuticles of the trilobites in that period.

==== Spines ====
Some trilobites such as those of the order [[Lichida]] evolved elaborate spiny forms, from the [[Ordovician]] until the end of the [[Devonian]] period. Examples of these specimens have been found in the Hamar Laghdad Formation of [[Alnif]] in [[Morocco]]. Collectors of this material should be aware of a serious counterfeiting and fakery problem with much of the Moroccan material that is offered commercially. Spectacular spined trilobites have also been found in western Russia; Oklahoma, USA; and Ontario, Canada. These spiny forms could possibly have been a defensive response to the evolutionary appearance of [[fish]].

Some trilobites had horns on their heads similar to those of modern beetles. Based on the size, location, and shape of the horns the most likely use of the horns was combat for mates, making the [[Asaphida]] [[family]] [[Raphiophoridae]] the earliest exemplars of this behavior.<ref name=Knell&Fortey05>{{citation |last1=Knell |first1=R.J. |last2=Fortey |first2=R.A.  |year=2005 |title=Trilobite spines and beetle horns: sexual selection in the Palaeozoic? |journal=Biology Letters |volume=1 |pages=196-199 |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1626209}} </ref>
A conclusion likely to be applicable to other trilobites as well, such as in the [[Phacopid]] trilobite genus ''[[Walliserops]]'' that developed spectacular tridents.<ref name=NewScientist05>{{citation|url=http://www.newscientist.com/channel/life/mg18625015.100/|title=Earliest combatants in sexual contests revealed|author=New Scientist magazine|authorlink=New Scientist|year=2005|publication-date=[[May 28]], [[2005]]}} </ref>

[[Image:LeggedTrilobite2.jpg|thumb|left|An exceptionally well preserved trilobite from the [[Burgess Shale]]. The antennæ and legs are preserved as reflective carbon films.]]

===  Soft Body Parts ===
==== Legs & Gills ====
Trilobites had a single pair of preoral [[antenna (biology)|antenna]]e and otherwise undifferentiated [[biramous]] limbs. Each exopodite (walking leg) had six segments, homologous to other early arthropods. The first segment also bore a feather-like epipodite, or [[gill]] branch, which was used for respiration and, in some species, swimming. The last expodite segment had a claw and 2 articulated flanking hooks.<ref name=Bruton03a />
Many examples of hairs on the legs suggest adaptations for feeding or sensory organs to help with walking.<ref name=Whittington97b>{{Citation |last=Whittington |first=H.B. |author-link= |contribution=The Trilobite Body. |editor-last=Kaesler |editor-first=R.L. (ed) |title=Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology, Part O, Arthropoda 1, Trilobita, revised. Volume 1: Introduction, Order Agnostida, Order Redlichiida. |pages=137-169 |publisher = The Geological Society of America, Inc. & The University of Kansas |place=Boulder, CO & Lawrence, KA |year=1997c |isbn=0-8137-3115-1}} </ref>

==== Digestive tract ====
The mouth of trilobites was situated on the rear edge of the hypostome, in front of the 2 pairs of legs attached to the cephalon. The mouth is linked by a small oesophagus to the stomach that lay forward of the mouth, below the glabella. The "intestine" led backwards from there to the pygidium.<ref name=Bruton03a />

== Sensory organs ==
Many trilobites had eyes; they also had [[antenna (biology)|antenna]]e that perhaps were used for taste and smell. Some trilobites were blind, probably living too deep in the sea for light to reach them. As such, they became secondarily blind in this branch of trilobite evolution.  Others, such as ''[[Phacops rana]]'', had eyes that were quite large for use in more well lit, predator-filled waters. 

=== Antennae ===
The pair of atennae are suspected in most trilobites (but preserved only in a few) were highly flexible to allow them to be retracted when the trilobite was enrolled. The antennae are probably similar to those in extant [[arthropods]].
=== Eyes ===
Even the earliest trilobites had complex, compound eyes with lenses made of calcite, a unique characteristic of all trilobite eyes. This confirms that eyes of arthropods and probably other animals were already quite developed at the beginning of the Cambrian. Improving eyesight of both predator and prey in marine environments probably provided one of the [[evolutionary pressure]]s furthering an apparent rapid development of new life forms during what is known as the [[Cambrian Explosion]].

The trilobite eyes were typically [[compound eye|compound]], with each lens being an elongated prism. The number of lenses in such an eye varied: some trilobites had only one, while some had thousands of lenses in a single eye. In these compound eyes, the lenses were typically arranged hexagonally.<ref name=Clarkson93 /> The fossil record of trilobite eyes is complete enough that their evolution can be studied through time, which compensates to some extent the lack of preservation of soft internal parts.<ref name=Clarkson79 /> 

The [[lens]]es of trilobites [[eye]]s were made of [[calcite]] ([[calcium carbonate]], CaCO<sub>3</sub>). Pure forms of calcite are transparent, and some trilobites used crystallographically oriented, clear calcite crystals to form each lens of each of their eyes.<ref name=Clarkson97>{{Citation | last = Clarkson | first = E.N. | contribution = The Eye, Morphology, Function and Evolution | editor-last = Kaesler | editor-first = R.L.

In this, they differ from most other arthropods, which have soft or chitin-supported eyes. 

The rigid calcite lenses of a trilobite eye would have been unable to [[accommodation (eye)|accommodate]] to a change of focus like the soft lens in a human eye would; however, in some trilobites the calcite formed an internal [[doublet (lens)|doublet]] structure,<ref name=Clarkson75 >{{Citation | last1 = Clarkson | first1 = E.

A living species with similar lenses is the [[brittle star]] ''[[Ophiocoma wendtii]]''. In other trilobites, with a Huygens interface apparently missing, a [[gradient index lens]] is invoked with the [[refractive index]] of the lens changing towards the center.<ref name=Bruton03b>{{Citation | last1 = Bruton | first1 = D.L. | last2 = Haas | first2 = W. | contribution = The Puzzling Eye of Phacops | editor-last = Lane, P.D., Siveter, D.J. & Fortey R.A. | title = Special Papers in Palaeontology '''70''': Trilobites and Their Relatives: Contributions from the Third International Conference, Oxford 2001|pages =349-362|publisher=Blackwell Publishing & Palaeontological Association |year=2003b |contribution-url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2E2fDXCkUEkC}} </ref>

[[Holochroal eye]]s had a great number (sometimes over 15,000) of small (30-100μm, rarely larger)<ref name=Clarkson79 >{{Citation | last1 = Clarkson | first1 = E. N. K. | year=1979 | title =The Visual System of Trilobites| journal =Palaeontology |volume= 22 |pages=1-22}} </ref> lenses. Lenses were [[hexagonal close packing|hexagonally close packed]], touching each other, with a single [[cornea|corneal membrane]] covering all lenses.<ref name=Clarkson97/> Holochroal eyes had no sclera, the white layer covering the eyes of most modern [[arthropods]]. Holochroal eyes are the ancestral eye of trilobites, and are by far the most common, found in all orders and through the entirety of the Trilobites' existance.<ref name=Clarkson79 /> Little is known of the early history of holochroal eyes; Lower and Middle Cambrian trilobites rarely preserve the visual surface.<ref name=Clarkson79 /> 
[[Image:Erbenochile eye.JPG|thumb|right|The Schizochroal eye (with eye shade) of ''[[Erbenochile|Erbenochile erbenii]]'' that proved [[Erbenochile|some trilobites were diurnal]].<ref name=Fortey&Chatterton2003 >{{Citation | last1 = Fortey | first1 = R. | last2 = Chatterton | First2 = B.| year=2003 | title = A Devonian Trilobite with an Eyeshade| journal =Science |volume= 301 |page=1689}} </ref>]]

[[Schizochroal eye]]s typically had fewer (to around 700), larger lenses, and are found only in [[Phacopida]].

[[Abathochroal eye]]s had around 70 small lenses, and are found only in [[agnostida|Cambrian Eodiscina]]. Each lens was separate and had an individual cornea. The sclera was separate from the cornea, and did not run as deep as the sclera in schizochroal eyes.<ref name=Clarkson97 />

'''Secondary blindness''' is not uncommon, particularly in long lived groups such as the Agnostida and Trinucleioidea. In Proetida, Phacopina and Tropidocoryphinae there are well studied trends showing progressive eye reduction between closely related species that eventually leads to blindness.<ref name=Clarkson97 />

Several other structures on trilobites have been explained as photo-receptors.<ref name=Clarkson97 /> Of particular interest are the small areas of thinned cuticle on the underside of the hypostome (macula) which, in some trilobites, are suggested to be simple '''ventral eyes''' that could have detected night and day or allowed a trilobite to navigate while swimming (or turned) upside down.<ref name=Bruton03b />

=== Sensory Pits ===
There are several types of prosopon that have been suggested as sensory apparatus collecting chemical or vibrational signals. The connection between large pitted fringes on the cephalon of [[Harpidea]] and [[Trinucleoidea]] with corresponding small or absent eyes makes for an interesting possibility of the fringe as a "compound ear".<ref name=Clarkson97 />

==Development==
Trilobites grew through successive molt stages called '''''instars''''', in which existing segments increased in size and new trunk segments appeared at a sub-terminal generative zone during the "anamorphic" phase of development. The molt itself, is called ecdysis. This was followed by the "epimorphic" developmental phase, in which the animal continued to grow and molt, but no new trunk segments were expressed in the exoskeleton.  The combination of anamorphic and epimorphic growth consistutes the "hemianamorphic" developmental mode that is common among many living arthropods. 

Trilobite development was unusual in the way in which articulations developed between segments, and changes in the development of articulation gave rise to the conventionally recognized developmental phases of the trilobite life cycle (divided into 3 stages), which are not readily compared with those of other arthropods.

Trilobites are thought to have reproduced sexually, producing eggs, albeit without undoubted examples in the fossil record.<ref name=Chatterton&Speyer97 /> Some species may have kept eggs or larvae in a brood pouch forward of the glabella,<ref name=Fortey98/> particularly when the [[ecological niche]] was particularly challenging to larvae.<ref name=Fortey00b/> Size and morphology of the first calcified stage are highly variable between (but not within) trilobite taxa, suggesting some trilobites passed through more growth within the egg than others. Early developmental stages prior to calcification of the exoskeleton are a possibility, but so is calcification and hatching coinciding.<ref name=Chatterton&Speyer97 />

The earliest post-embryonic trilobite growth stage known with certainty are the '''''protaspid''''' stages.<ref name=Chatterton&Speyer97/> Starting with  an indistinguishable proto-cephalon and proto-pygidium (anaprotaspid) a number of changes occur ending with a transverse furrow separating the proto-cephalon and proto-pygidium (metaprotaspid) that can continue to add segments.  Segments are added at the posterior part of the pygidium but, all segments remain fused together.<ref name=Chatterton&Speyer97/><ref name=LeroseyWeb /> 
 
The '''''meraspid''''' phase of development is marked by the appearance of an articulation between the head and the fused trunk. At the onset of the meraspid phase the animal had a two-part structure - the head and the plate of fused trunk segments, the pygidium. During the meraspid phase, new segments appeared near the rear of the pygidium as additional articulations developed at the anterior of the pygidium, releasing freely articulating thoracic segments. Segments are generally added one per molt (although two per molt and one every alternate molt are also recorded), with number of stages equal to the number of thoracic segments. A substantial amount of growth, from less than 25% up to 30-40%, probably took place in the meraspid stages.<ref name=Chatterton&Speyer97 />

The '''''holaspid''''' phase of growth commenced when a stable, mature number of segments had been released into the thorax. Molting continued during the holaspid stage, with no changes in thoracic segment number.<ref name=Chatterton&Speyer97 /> Onset of the holaspid phase and the epimorphic phase was coincident in some, but not all, trilobites. 

Some trilobites showed a marked transition in morphology at one particular instar, which has been called '''''trilobite metamorphosis'''''. Radical change in morphology is linked to the loss or gain of distinctive features that mark a change in mode of life.<ref name=Chatterton&Speyer89>{{Citation | last1 = Chatterton | first1 = B.D.E. | last2 = Speyer | first2 = S.E. | title  = Larval ecology, life history strategies, and patterns of extinction and survivorship among Ordovician trilobites | pages = 118-132 | year = 1989 | journal = Paleobiology | vol = 15 | }} </ref> A change in lifestyle during development has significance in terms of [[evolutionary pressure]], as the trilobite could pass through several [[ecological niches]] on the way to adult development and changes would strongly affect survivor-ship and dispersal of trilobite taxa.<ref name=Chatterton&Speyer97 /> It is worth noting that trilobites with all protaspid stages planktonic 
and meraspid stages benthic (e.g. Asaphids) failed to last through the Ordovician extinctions, while trilobites that were planktonic for only the first protaspid stage before metamorphosing into benthic forms survived (e.g. Lichids, Phacopids).<ref name=Chatterton&Speyer89 />

==Fossil record==
The earliest trilobite known from the [[fossil record]] is the [[genus]] [[Fallotaspis]] within [[Order (biology)|Order]] [[Redlichiida]], dated to some {{ma|540}}.<ref name=Fortey00a>{{citation|title=Trilobite!|first=Richard|last=Fortey|year=2000|isbn=0-00-257012-2}}</ref>  Other early genera include ''[[Profalloptaspis]]'' and ''[[Eofallotaspis]]'', all appearing about the same time.

===Origins===
Based on morphological similarities, it is possible that the trilobites have their ancestors in arthropod-like creatures such as ''[[Spriggina]]'', ''[[Parvancorina]]'', and other '''trilobitomorphs''' of the [[Ediacaran]] period of the [[Precambrian]]. There are many morphological similarities between early trilobites and other [[Cambrian]] arthropods known from the [[Burgess Shale]], the [[Maotianshan shales]] at Chengjiang and other [[fossil]]iferous locations. These are investigated further here: [http://www.trilobites.info/triloclass.htm]
It is reasonable to assume that the trilobites share a common ancestor with these other arthropods prior to the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary.  Ancestral trilobites may have been somewhat soft bodied and developed their thick carapaces through Cuticularisation.  As with other forms of trilobite body evolution, this was a defensive measure.

===Extinction===
The reason for the extinction of the trilobites is not clear, although it may be no coincidence that their numbers began to decrease with the appearance of the first [[shark]]s and other early [[gnathostome]]s in the [[Silurian]] and their subsequent rise in diversity during the [[Devonian]] period. Trilobites may have provided a rich source of food for these new animals. A smaller extinction event in the Middle Cambrian of trilobite orders possessing alimentary prosopon and a micropygidium may have been linked to the rise of cephalopods. Trilobites were under great selective pressure to develop defensive bodies quickly.  The most radical change in body form occurred in the Middle Cambrian. As a means of defense, surviving orders developed isopygidius or macropygius bodies. This enabled trilobites to curl their bodies into a ball as a means of defense.  A micropygidius trilobite cannot completely protect itself in a curled position with a pygidium smaller than the cephalon.  It is analogous to pleurodirian (side-necked) turtles of the present day (Holocene).  A terrestrial side neck could never evolve because the exposed neck in a side withdraw state would be vulnerable to a predator.  Surviving trilobites developed thicker cuticles (as mentioned earlier) and as such, the alimentary prosopon are no longer visible due to the thickness.  This makes an excellent fossil stratigraphic marker of the Cambrian period: Researchers who find trilobites with alimentary prosopon, and a micropygium, have found Early Cambrian strata.<ref name=schnirel01>{{citation|last=Schnirel|first=B.L.|year=2001|title=Trilobite Evolution and Extinction|publisher=Graves Museum of Natural History|publication-place=Dania, Florida}}</ref>

After the mid-Cambrian extinction event, the next great extinction event occurred at the Frasnian - Famennian boundary at the end of the Devonian period. All orders (except one) of Trilobites became extinct.  Trilobites were bottlenecked into one single order, the Proetida. This single order survived for millions of years, continued through the Carboniferous period and lasted to the great extinction event at the end of the Permian (where the vast majority of species on earth were wiped out).  It is unknown why Order Proedita alone, survived.  It may have been a deeper water order that was able to avoid rapid changes that would affect species along the continental shelves.  For many millions of years, the Proetida found a perfect niche.   An anology would be today's [[crinoid]]s which exist as deep water species only. In the Paleozoic era, vast 'forests' of crinoids lived in shallow near shore environments. 

Additionally, their relatively low numbers and diversity at the end of the Permian no doubt contributed to their extinction during that great [[Permian extinction|mass extinction event]]. Foreshadowing this, the [[Ordovician-Silurian extinction events|Ordovician mass extinction]], though somewhat less substantial than the Permian one, also seems to have significantly narrowed trilobite diversity.

The closest extant relatives of trilobites may be the [[horseshoe crab]]s,<ref name=Fortey00a /> or the [[Cephalocarida|cephalocarids]].<ref name=lambert85>{{citation|first=David|last=Lambert|publisher=the Diagram Group|title=The Field Guide to Prehistoric Life|publication-place=New York|series=Facts on File Publications|year=1985|isbn=0-8160-1125-7}}</ref>

==Fossil distribution==
[[Image:Cruziana2.jpg|thumb|''[[Cruziana]]'', fossil trilobite furrowing trace.]]

Trilobites appear to have been exclusively marine organisms, since the fossilized remains of trilobites are always found in rocks containing fossils of other salt-water animals such as brachiopods, crinoids, and corals.  Within the marine paleoenvironment, trilobites were found in a broad range from extremely shallow water to very deep water. The tracks left behind by trilobites crawling on the sea floor are often preserved as trace fossils.  These same trace fossils are also occasionally found in freshwater environments,<ref name=woolfe90>{{citation | last = Woolfe | first = K.J. | year = 1990 | title = Trace fossils as paleoenvironmental indicators in the Taylor Group (Devonian) of Antarctica | journal = Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology | volume = 80 | pages = 301–310 | doi = 10.1016/0031-0182(90)90139-X}}</ref> suggesting either that some freshwater trilobites existed, or that the tracks are also made by other organisms. Trilobites, like brachiopods, crinoids, and corals, are found on all modern continents, and occupied every ancient ocean from which Paleozoic fossils have been collected.

Trilobite fossils are found worldwide, with many thousands of known species. Because they appeared quickly in geological time, and moulted like other arthropods, trilobites serve as excellent [[index fossil]]s, enabling geologists to date the age of the rocks in which they are found. They were among the first fossils to attract widespread attention, and new species are being discovered every year. Some [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], recognizing that trilobites were water creatures, had a name for them which means "little water bug in the rocks".

A famous location for trilobite fossils in the [[United Kingdom]] is [[Wren's Nest]], [[Dudley]] in the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], where ''[[Calymene blumenbachi]]'' is found in the [[Silurian]] [[Wenlock Group]]. This trilobite is featured on the town's [[coat of arms]] and was named the ''Dudley Bug'' or ''Dudley Locust'' by quarrymen who once worked the now abandoned [[limestone]] quarries. Other trilobites found there include ''Dalmanites'', ''Trimerus'', ''Bumastus'' and ''Balizoma''. Llandrindod Wells, Powys, Wales, is another famous trilobite location.  The well known ''Elrathia kingi'' trilobite is found in spectacular abundance in the Wheeler Shale ([[Cambrian]]) of west-central Utah.

Spectacular trilobite fossils, showing soft body parts like legs, gills and antennae, have been found in British Columbia ([[Burgess Shale]] Cambrian fossils, and similar localities in the Canadian Rockies); New York State (Odovician Walcott-Rust Quarry, near Utica, N.Y., and the Beecher Trilobite Beds, near Rome, N.Y.), in China (Burgess Shale-like Lower Cambrian trilobites in the [[Maotianshan shales]] near Chengjiang), Germany (the Devonian [[Hunsrück Slates]] near Bundenbach, Germany) and, much more rarely, in trilobite-bearing strata in Utah and Ontario.

Trilobites are collected commercially in Russia (especially in the St. Petersburg area), Germany, Morocco's Atlas Mountains, (where a burgeoning trade in faked trilobites is also under way), Utah, Ohio, British Columbia, and in other parts of Canada.
