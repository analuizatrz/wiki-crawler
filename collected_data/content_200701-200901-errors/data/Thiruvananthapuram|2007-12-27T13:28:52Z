'''Thiruvananthapuram''' {{audio|Thiruvananthapuram.ogg|[t̪iruʋən̪ɨn̪t̪əpurəm]}} ([[Malayalam language|Malayalam]]: തിരുവനന്തപുരം ''Tiruvanŭntapuraṁ''), [[Indian renaming controversy|also]] known as '''Trivandrum''', is the capital of the [[India|Indian]] state of [[Kerala]] and the headquarters of the [[Thiruvananthapuram District]]. It is located on the west coast of [[India]] near the extreme south of the mainland. Referred to by [[Mahatma Gandhi]] as the "Evergreen city of India", the city is characterized by its undulating terrain of low coastal hills and busy commercial alleys. With almost 745,000 inhabitants per the 2001 census, it is the largest and most populous city in Kerala; the wider urban agglomeration having a population of about one million.

The city is the state capital and houses many [[Government of India|central]] and state government offices, organizations and companies. Apart from being the political nerve centre of [[Kerala]], it is also a major academic hub and is home to several educational institutions including the [[Kerala University]], and to many science and technology institutions, the most prominent being the [[Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre]] (VSSC), Sree Chitra Tirunal Instiute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST), [[Technopark, Kerala|Technopark]], [[Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology]] (RGCB) and Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IIST).

==Origin of name==
Thiruvananthapuram literally means "''City of Lord Anantha''" in Malayalam. The name derives from the [[deity]] of the [[Hindu]] [[Hindu temple|temple]] at the centre of the city. Anantha is the serpent [[Shesha]] on whom Padmanabhan or [[Vishnu]] reclines. The temple of [[Vishnu]] reclining on [[Ananta|Anantha]], the [[Sri Padmanabhaswamy temple]] is the most recognizable iconic landmark of the city. The city was officially referred to as ''Trivandrum'' in English until 1991, when the government decided to reinstate the city's original name Thiruvananthapuram in all languages. However, the city is still widely referred to as "Trivandrum" informally.

The rise of modern Thiruvananthapuram began with accession of [[Marthanda Varma]] in 1729 as the founding ruler of the princely state of  [[Travancore]] (''Thiruvithamkoor'' in the local vernacular). Thiruvananthapuram was made the capital of Travancore in 1745. The city developed into a major intellectual and artistic centre during this period. The golden age in the city's history was during the mid 19th century under the reign of [[Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma|Maharaja Swathi Thirunal]] and [[Ayilyam Thirunal|Maharaja Ayilyam Thirunal]]. This era saw the establishment of the first English school (1834), the Observatory (1837), the General Hospital (1839), [[the Oriental Research Institute & Manuscripts Library]]  and the University College (1873).  The first Lunatic Asylum in the state was also started during the same period. Sanskrit College, Ayurveda College, Law College and a second grade college for women were started by [[Moolam Thirunal]] (1885–1924). 

The early 19th century was an age of tremendous political and social changes in the city. The Sree Moolam Assembly, established in 1904 was the first democratically elected legislative council in any Indian state. Despite not being under direct control of the [[British Empire]] at any time, the city however featured prominently in [[Indian independence movement|India's freedom struggle]]. The [[Indian National Congress]] had a very active presence in the city. A meeting of the Indian National Congress presided by Dr. [[Pattabhi Sitaramaiah]] was held here in 1938.  

The period of [[Chitra Thirunal Bala Rama Varma]], who took over in 1931, witnessed many-sided progress. The promulgation of "[[Temple Entry Proclamation]]" (1936) was an act that underlined social emancipation. This era also saw the establishment of the University of Travancore in 1937, which later became the [[Kerala University]].

With the end of the British rule in 1947, Travancore chose to join the Indian union. The first popular ministry headed by [[Pattom Thanu Pillai]] was installed in office on [[24 March]] [[1948]]. In 1949, Thiruvananthapuram became the capital of [[Travancore-Cochin|Thiru-Kochi]], the state formed by the integration of Travancore with its northern neighbour [[Kochi, India|Kochi]]. The king of [[Travancore]], [[Chitra Thirunal Bala Rama Varma]] became the [[Rajpramukh]] of the [[Travancore-Cochin|Travancore-Cochin Union]] from [[July 1]] [[1949]] until [[October 31]] [[1956]]. When the state of [[Kerala]] was formed on [[November 1]] [[1956]], Thiruvananthapuram became the capital of the new state.

With the establishment of [[Thumba|Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station]] (TERLS) in 1962, Thiruvananthapuram became the cradle of India's ambitious space programme. The first Indian space rocket was developed and launched from the [[Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre]] (VSSC) located in the outskirts of the city in 1963. Several establishments of the [[Indian Space Research Organization]] (ISRO) were later established in Thiruvananthapuram.<ref name="VSSC Trivandrum">

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Thiruvananthapuram}}
[[Image:Tpbhavaniview1.jpg|thumb|A View of a [[Technopark Kerala|Technopark]] building]]
The economy of Thiruvananthapuram city was earlier based on the tertiary sector with about 60% of the workforce being employed as government servants. Large scale industrial establishments are low compared to other south Indian state capitals like [[Chennai]] and [[Bangalore]]. At present the economy is growing with the contributions from more professionals in the fields of IT, and Medical/Bio-Technology. The city contributes 80% of software exports from the state. The opening of many private Television channels in the state, made Thiruvananthapuram the home of several studios and related industries. India's first and only animation park is situated here. 

Since the establishment of [[Technopark Kerala|Technopark]] in 1995, Thiruvananthapuram has steadily grown into a competitive IT centre. The city was rated as the best 2nd tier metro with IT/ITES infrastructure, and second in terms of availability of human talent.<ref name="Indian IT destinations">

The sewerage system in the city was implemented at the time of the Travancore Kingdom, and modernised in 1938. This scheme for the disposal of sullage and sewage is an underground system. The whole system is controlled by Kerala Water Authority now. The city area is divided in to seven blocks for the execution of the sewerage system, two commissioned in the 1990s and two after 2000. The sewerage is pumped to a stilling chamber at the Sewerage Treatment Plant (STP) located at Valiyathura, and is disposed through sewage farming. Diary Development Department maintains this sewage farm and fodder cultivation is done here. There is no revenue generation from this scheme, and the sewerage system in the city is a service provided to the residents.<ref name="Thiruvananthapuram Sewerage Scheme">

==Transport==
[[Image:Tvmcentral.jpg|thumb|[[Trivandrum Central]] Railway Station]]

Within the city, city buses and [[autorickshaw]]s provide means of transportation. Scooters, motorcycles and regular bicycles are the favoured means of personal transportation.

The intra-city public transport is dominated by the state-owned [[Kerala State Road Transport Corporation|KSRTC]] (Kerala State Road Transport Corporation). There are also private bus services, but are limited in number. The city services of KSRTC operate from six depots namely, the City depot, Vikas Bhavan, Peroorkada, Pappanamcode, Kaniyapuram and Vellanad. These services were revamped in 2005 with the introduction of modern buses and electronic ticketing mechanisms. The central city bus terminal is located at [[East fort]], near the Padmanabha Swamy temple. The Central and Inter State bus station is located 1&nbsp;km away at Thampanoor. Buses from it go to all major towns and villages in the State as well as big cities in India such as Bangalore and Chennai. 

The [[Trivandrum Central|Central railway station]] is also located at Thampanoor in the heart of the city, 8&nbsp;km from the airport. It is a very important terminus which handles over 50 trains daily. The city is well connected by rail to almost all major cities in India. Thiruvananthapuram is the first major city from south along the second longest train route in the world, [[Kanyakumari]] to [[Jammu]]. A second satellite station was opened in 2005 at Kochuveli, near the International Airport.

[[Image:Image(55).jpg|thumb|[[Trivandrum International Airport]]]]
Thiruvananthapuram's [[Trivandrum International Airport|International Airport]], with direct flights from the [[Middle East]], [[Singapore]], [[Maldives]] and [[Sri Lanka]] is the gateway to the tourism-rich state of [[Kerala]]. [[Indian Airlines]], [[Jet Airways]], [[Air Deccan]], [[Kingfisher Airlines]] and [[Paramount Airways]] are the domestic airlines operating from here. [[Air India]], [[Air-India Express]], [[Gulf Air]], [[Oman Air]], [[Kuwait Airways]], [[SilkAir]], [[Etihad]], [[Srilankan Airlines]], [[Qatar Airways]], [[Air Arabia]] and [[Emirates]] operate international flights. There are also two military airports one near the civilian airport and the other at the Southern Air Command of the [[Indian Air Force]] at [[Akkulam]]. Apart from regular scheduled flights, many chartered flights from Europe like [[First Choice Airways]] from [[London Gatwick]] and [[Monarch Airlines|Monarch]], operating with big jets, land here during the peak tourist season (around December); with Kerala fast becoming a prime tourist destination in India. Thiruvanthapuram airport's importance is also due to the fact that it is the southernmost airport in India and also the closest (and thus cheapest option) for neighbouring countries like [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Maldives]].  
[[Image:Tvmdoubedecker.jpg|thumb|Double Decker Buses which was a major attraction of the city]]
The construction of the mega Deep Water Container Trans-shipment Port at [[Vizhinjam]] is expected to begin in 2007. It is to be built in three phases, and expected to be a key competitor in the ports business (especially for container transshipments), with the international shipping lanes between Europe and the Far East very close to the port, and also with major ports like [[Colombo]], [[Kochi (India)|Kochi]] and [[Tuticorin]] in close proximity.<ref name="Vizhinjam Data Sheet">

The exponential growth of the services and IT based sectors coupled with its prominence as the state capital and tourist centre has caused considerable strain on the transport infrastructure of the city. To tackle this crisis, several multi-million dollar construction projects are now underway including the construction of several new [[underpass|underpasses]] and [[flyover]]s, scheduled to be completed by early 2007. In the first phase, 42&nbsp;km of six-lane and four-lane dual carriage ways are being built.
