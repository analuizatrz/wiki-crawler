==History==
Herzliya, named after Theodor Herzl,<ref name="haaretz">{{cite web|title=Herzliya: For the Young at Heart, Not the Young|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1021009.html|author=Shemesh, Hen|coauthors=Dattel, Lior|accessdate=2008-10-18}}</ref> was founded in 1924 as a semi-cooperative farming community ([[moshava]]) with a mixed population of new immigrants and veteran residents. After the establishment of the state in 1948, large numbers of immigrants settled there. In 1960, when the population reached 25,000, Herzliya was declared a city.<ref name="goisrael">{{cite web|url=http://www.goisrael.com/Tourism_Eng/Tourist+Information/Discover+Israel/Cities/Hertzeliya.htm|title=Herzliya|publisher=GoIsrael.com|work=Israel Wonders|accessdate=2008-10-18}}</ref>
