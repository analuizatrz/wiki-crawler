'''Jonathan Allen Lethem''' (born [[February 19]], [[1964]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[writer]] based in [[New York City]], best known for his novels, short stories, and essays, whose work encompasses a variety of genres and styles.

==Biography==

Lethem was raised in the [[Boerum Hill]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn, New York]], and lives there currently.  His mother (an [[activist]]) and his father (the [[avant-garde]] painter Richard Brown Lethem) were [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]]s living in a pre-[[gentrification|gentrified]] area of [[New York City|NYC]] during the [[1970s]]. Lethem's mother died while he was a teen. 

Intending to become a visual artist like his father, Lethem attended [[The High School of Music & Art]] where he painted, in a style [http://nndb.com/people/546/000029459/ he describes] as "glib, show-offy, usually cartoonish."  At Music & Art he produced his own zine, ''The Literary Exchange,'' that featured artwork and writing, and he wrote a 125 page unpublished novel, ''Heroes.'' 

After high school he entered Vermont's [[Bennington College]] in [[Vermont]] in the early [[1980s]] but soon dropped out.  He then hitchhiked cross-country to [[California]] and settled there for a decade or so, working as a clerk in bookstores and writing in his own time. After managing to publish just a few short stories in the late 1980s and early [[1990s]], Lethem broke into the literary scene in full force once his first novel was published. ''[[Gun, with Occasional Music]]'' was a merging of science fiction and the [[Raymond Chandler|Chandleresque]] detective story, complete with talking [[kangaroo]]s, radical futuristic versions of the illegal drug scene, and [[cryogenic]] containment cells. The novel was a finalist for the [[1994]] [[Nebula Award]], and placed first in the "Best First Novel" category of the [[1995]] ''[[Locus (magazine)|Locus Magazine]]'' reader's poll.

Lethem put forth very different books at each successive turn. The [[1995]] novel ''[[Amnesia Moon]]'' explored a multi-[[post-apocalyptic]] future landscape highly influenced by [[Philip K. Dick]], a poly-[[dystopia]] rife with perception tricks. 

After publishing many of his early stories in a [[1996]] collection (''[[The Wall of the Sky, the Wall of the Eye]]''), Lethem's next novel, ''[[As She Climbed Across the Table]]'' was a love story set in motion when a physics researcher falls in love with an artificially generated spatial anomaly. Her previous partner is spurned, and his comic struggle with this rejection, and with the anomaly called "Lack," constitute the majority of the narrative. (Lethem's friend, novelist [[David Bowman]], helped him name the novel, suggesting that Lethem -- who was having a hard time deciding on a title -- take the title from the last line of the novel: also the technique [[Thomas Pynchon]] used for ''[[The Crying of Lot 49]]''. Bowman later dedicated his novel ''[[Bunny Modern]]'' to Lethem.)

In the late 1990s, Lethem moved from the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] back to Brooklyn. His next book, published after his return to Brooklyn, was ''[[Girl in Landscape]]''. Its plot bore similarities to the [[John Wayne]] [[1950s]] [[film|movie]] classic ''[[The Searchers (movie)|The Searchers]]''. A young girl is forced to endure [[puberty]] while also having to face a strange and new world populated by aliens known as Archbuilders. 

The first novel begun after he returned to New York City in [[1999|1999's]] ''[[Motherless Brooklyn]]'', which takes on the detective theme once again, this time maintaining objective realism while exploring subjective [[alterity]] through a protagonist with [[Tourette syndrome]]. [[Edward Norton]] is adapting and planning to star in a film adaptation described as being "in production" [[as of 2006]]. [http://imdb.com/title/tt0385887/] The novel won the National Book Critic's Circle Award, The Macallan Gold Dagger for crime fiction, the Salon Book Award, and was named book of the year by ''Esquire''. It is generally regarded as Lethem's most endearing and irresistible novel.

Following the success of ''[[Motherless Brooklyn]]'' his UK publisher brought out new editions of his back catalogue. This included the first UK edition of ''Girl In Landscape'' and a revised version of ''The Wall of the Sky, The Wall of the Eye ''.

In the interval of four years during which he wrote his next novel, ''[[The Fortress of Solitude (novel)|The Fortress of Solitude]]'', Lethem also published story collections, edited volumes, wrote magazine pieces, and shepherded his 55-page novella ''[[This Shape We're In]]'' to an eventual niche as one of the first offerings from [[McSweeney's]] Books, the publishing [[imprint]] that arose from [[Dave Eggers]]'s [[Timothy McSweeney's Quarterly Concern|''McSweeney's Quarterly Concern'']].

Lethem also married and divorced during this period, living briefly in Toronto in the process. In 2003 he finally published his semi-autobiographical [[bildungsroman]], ''[[The Fortress of Solitude (novel)|The Fortress of Solitude]]'', a novel of encompassing ambition featuring dozens of characters in a variety of milieus -- but which centers on a tale of racial tensions and boyhood in [[Brooklyn]] during the late [[1970s]].  The main characters are two friends of different backgrounds who grew up on the same block in [[Boerum Hill]]. It was named one of nine "Editor's Choice" books of the year by the [[New York Times]], and eventually published in over fifteen languages. For many readers, this engaging, sprawling, uneven tome is Lethem's greatest testament to date.

His second collection of short fiction, ''[[Men and Cartoons]]'', was published in late [[2004]]. In March, 2005, ''[[The Disappointment Artist]]'', his first collection of essays, was also released.

In March, 2007, Lethem published ''[[You Don't Love Me Yet]]'', a novel about a rock band in [[California]], a return to the setting of much of his earlier fiction. This novel revolves around a woman in the band, Lucinda, who answers phones for her friend's complaint line and uses some of a caller's words as lyrics.

The polarity between [[California]] and [[New York]], between the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] of [[Raymond_Chandler|Chandler]] and [[Philip_K_Dick|Dick]] and the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] of Lethem's childhood, black music, and graffiti, is one of the most important semantic axes in his oeuvre. Considering ''[[The Fortress of Solitude (novel)|The Fortress of Solitude]]'' is a partly autobiographical novel, Lethem's Californian novels become an escape from his New York childhood, while the [[New York City]] diptych (''[[Motherless Brooklyn]]'' and ''[[The Fortress of Solitude (novel)|The Fortress of Solitude]]'') is a return to the author's origin and past.

On [[September 20]], [[2005]], he was named as one of the 2005 recipients of the [[Macarthur Grant#MacArthur Fellowship|MacArthur Fellowship]], often referred to as the "genius grant."

He is currently working on a revival of [[Omega the Unknown]] for [[Marvel Comics]] that has met with severe opposition by creators [[Steve Gerber]] and [[Mary Skrenes]].

In September 2006, Lethem published a lengthy interview with [[Bob Dylan]] in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine; the interview contained Lethem's reflections on Dylan's artistic achievements, as well as revealing Dylan's dissatisfaction with contemporary recording techniques and his thoughts on his own status.<ref>{{cite news
