The '''I-35W Mississippi River bridge''' was an eight-lane, {{convert|1907|ft|m|0}} steel [[truss arch bridge]] that carried [[Interstate 35W (Minnesota)|Interstate 35W]] across the [[Mississippi River]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], [[United States]].

At 6:05 pm on Wednesday, [[August 1]] [[2007]], during the evening [[rush hour]], the main spans of the bridge collapsed, falling into the river and onto its banks. Thirteen people died and approximately one hundred more were injured. Immediately after the collapse help came from [[mutual aid (emergency services)|mutual aid]] in the seven-[[county]] [[metropolitan area]] and a multitude of civilians, hospitals, volunteers and agencies.

== Location ==
[[Image:I 35W Bridge.svg|350px|thumb|left|Map showing bridge location in red.]]
Located in Minneapolis, the [[county seat]] of [[Hennepin County, Minnesota]], this north-south bridge connected the Minneapolis neighborhoods of [[Downtown East, Minneapolis|Downtown East]] and [[Marcy-Holmes, Minneapolis|Marcy-Holmes]].

The north abutment of the bridge was northwest of the [[University of Minnesota]] East Bank campus. The south abutment was northeast of the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome|Metrodome]]. Along with the [[Plymouth Avenue Bridge]], the I-35W bridge bounded the "Mississippi Mile" riverfront parkland.<ref>Flanagan, Barbara. ([[August 26]] [[1988]]) [[Star Tribune]] ''Sheba the donkey is off Nicollet Island, but on pictorial map of it.'' Section:News; page 3B.</ref>

This section of the river is crowded with structures. Immediately upstream is the Lower [[Saint Anthony Falls]] lock and dam. The first bridge upstream is the [[Stone Arch Bridge]] built for [[rail transport]], preserved in 1994 as a [[List of historic civil engineering landmarks|national historic civil engineering landmark]] and now carrying pedestrians and cyclists between downtown Minneapolis and the university.<ref>{{cite web|title=History & Heritage of Civil Engineering|url=http://live.asce.org/hh/index.mxml?lid=158|publisher=American Society of Civil Engineers|date=|accessdate=2007-08-29}}</ref> Downstream and even closer is the [[10th Avenue Bridge]], once known as the Cedar Avenue Bridge.

The bridge was one of the two major river crossings of [[I-35W (Minnesota)|I-35W]] in Minnesota, (the western branch of [[Interstate 35]] through the [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul]] metropolitan area). The other major bridge is the [[I-35W Minnesota River bridge]] located 15&nbsp;miles (24&nbsp;km) to the south over the [[Minnesota River]].

==Site history==
The I-35W Mississippi River bridge was located in the area where Minneapolis began, located just downstream from [[Saint Anthony Falls]], which is the only natural waterfall in the Upper Mississippi River.  Completed in 1956, the lower Saint Anthony Falls dam is a gravity type [[hydroelectricity|hydro-electric dam]] {{convert|60|ft|m|0}} in height.  In November of 1987 the Saint Anthony Lower Hydro-Electric Plant experienced an undermining failure and on [[August 19]], [[1988]] the facility was razed; it had been very near the north bank foundation pier of the I-35W bridge. 

The area of the bridge's south abutment was a site of industrial chemical pollution. For 90 years prior to the bridge's construction, [[History of Minneapolis, Minnesota#Hydroelectric power|Minnegasco's]] predecessor, Minneapolis Gas Works,<ref name="burned">Meersman, Tom. ([[April 28]] [[1993]]) [[Star Tribune]] ''Citizens board OKs NSP plan to burn tainted soil.''

The tract's long-term industrial use effectively resulted in a toxic-waste dump below the bridge. The legal wrangling over the bill for the riverfront cleanup led to a 1991 lawsuit.<ref name="toxic" /> 15,000&nbsp;tons (13,600 [[tonne|t]]) of contaminated soil were removed from below the bridge, ground up with wood chips and burned as a fuel additive for a power plant between 1993 and 1998 at a cost of [[United States dollar|US$]]30 million.<ref name="burned" /><ref>Meersman, Tom.

==Design and construction==
[[Image:I35WBridgeMinneapolisSatellite2004.jpg|thumb|left|I-35W bridge (center left) west of the [[10th Avenue Bridge]] (center right), over the [[Mississippi River]], 2004]]
The bridge, officially designated '''Bridge 9340','' was designed by [[Sverdrup & Parcel]] to 1961 [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials|American Association of State Highway Officials]] (AASHO, the precursor to AASHTO) standard specifications. The construction contracts, worth in total more than US$5.2 million at the time, went to Hurcon Inc. and Industrial Construction Company (the latter having since gone out of business),<ref name=cp0809 /> with Industrial Construction Company building the steel trusses and deck. Construction began in 1964 and the bridge opened to traffic in 1967.<ref name = "fatigue" /><ref name="factsheet" /> 

[[Image:I-35W Bridge 2.jpg|thumb|I-35W bridge south end seen from West River Parkway]]
In its entirety, the bridge was over 1,900&nbsp;feet (580&nbsp;m) long. It consisted of fourteen spans: five south approach spans, three main spans, and six north approach spans. The three main spans were of [[truss bridge|deck truss]] construction while all but two of the approach spans were [[girder bridge|steel multi-girder]] construction with the remaining two approach spans being [[concrete slab]] construction. The bridge had no [[Deep foundation|piers]] built into the [[stream bed|river bed]]; instead, the center span of the bridge consisted of a single 458-foot (140&nbsp;m) steel arched truss over the 390-foot (119&nbsp;m) wide navigation channel. The two support piers for the main trusses, each with two load-bearing concrete pylons at either side of the center main span, were located on opposite banks of the river.<ref name="WCCO"> {{cite news | url=http://wcco.com/topstories/local_story_213191448.html| title=At Least 7 Dead in I35 Bridge Collapse|publisher=WCCO News|date=[[2007-08-01]]}}</ref><ref name="CJAD">{{cite news |url=http://www.cjad.com/news/56/565299 |title=U.S. officials urge quick inspections of bridges similar to Minneapolis span |date=[[2007-08-02]]}}</ref> The center span was connected to the north and south approaches by shorter spans formed by the same main trusses.

===Black ice===
In February and in December 1996, the bridge was identified as the single most treacherous cold-weather spot in the [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul|Twin Cities]] freeway system, because of the almost frictionless thin layer of [[black ice]] which regularly forms as temperatures drop to 30s Fahrenheit (−1°C to 4°C) and below. The bridge's proximity to Saint Anthony Falls contributed significantly to the icing problem and the site was noted for frequent spinouts and collisions<ref>Blake, Laurie.

==Maintenance and inspection==
[[Image:I-35WBridgeOverhead.jpg|thumb|left|I-35W bridge (left) in 2006]]
Since 1993, the bridge was inspected annually by Mn/DOT, although no inspection report was completed in 2007, due to the construction work.<ref name=cp0809>{{cite journal|author=Anderson, G.R. Jr., Paul Demko, Kevin Hoffman, Jonathan Kaminsky, Matt Smith and Matt Snyder|title=Falling Down|work=City Pages|publisher=Village Voice Media volume=28|issue=1392|date=[[2007-08-09]]|url= http://citypages.com/databank/28/1392/article15743.asp|accessdate=2007-08-29}}</ref> In the years prior to the collapse, several reports cited problems with the bridge structure. In 1990, the federal government gave the I-35W bridge a rating of "structurally deficient," citing significant corrosion in its bearings. "Structurally deficient" is a classification term which does not in itself indicate a lack of safety. Approximately 75,000 other U.S. bridges had this classification in 2007.<ref name=cp0809 /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=3442381|title= Minn. bridge problems uncovered in 1990 |accessdate=2007-08-03 |author= Cohen, Sharon; Bakst, Brian (Associated Press) |date=[[2007-08-02]]|work=ABC News (abc.go.com)|publisher=The Walt Disney Company}}</ref>

According to a 2001 study by the civil engineering department of the [[University of Minnesota]], cracking had been previously discovered in the cross girders at the end of the approach spans. The main trusses connected to these cross girders and resistance to motion at the connection point bearings was leading to unanticipated out-of-plane distortion of the cross girders and subsequent stress cracking. The situation was addressed prior to the study by drilling the cracks to prevent further propagation and adding supports struts to the cross girder to prevent further distortion. The report also noted a concern about lack of redundancy in the main [[truss]] system, which meant the bridge had a greater risk of collapse in the event of any single structural failure. Although the report concluded that the bridge should not have any problems with [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue cracking]] in the foreseeable future, the bridge instrumentation by strain gages and continuous [[structural health monitoring]] had been suggested<ref name="fatigue">[http://www.lrrb.org/pdf/200110.pdf Fatigue Evaluation of the Deck Truss of Bridge 9340], Minnesota Department of Transportation, Report #MN/RC-2001–10, March 2001, retrieved from Minnesota Local Road Research Board website</ref>.

[[Image:I-35W Bridge - April, 2006.jpg|thumb|The bridge seen from below in 2006]]
In 2005, the bridge was again rated as "structurally deficient" and in possible need of replacement, according to the [[United States Department of Transportation|U.S. Department of Transportation's]] [[National Bridge Inventory]] database.<ref>[http://apnews.myway.com/article/20070802/D8QOTC180.html Associated Press], ''Hopes Dim in Minneapolis for Survivors,'' 2 August 2007, retrieved 2 August 2007</ref> Problems were noted in two subsequent inspection reports.<ref name='mndot061005'>{{cite web |url=http://www.dot.state.mn.us/hottopics/35w/bridge_inspection_06-10-05.pdf |title=Bridge Inspection Report 06–10–05}}</ref><ref name="mndot061506">{{cite web |url=http://www.dot.state.mn.us/i35wbridge/pdfs/bridge_inspection_report_06-15-06.pdf |title=Bridge Inspection Report 06–15–06}}</ref> The inspection carried out [[June 15]], [[2006]] found problems of cracking and fatigue.<ref name="mndot061506"/> On [[August 1]], Governor [[Tim Pawlenty|Pawlenty]] said his interpretation of the reports indicated that the bridge would last until 2020 or beyond.<ref name=Guardian>{{cite web| last =Krawczynski | first =Jon | title =Death Toll Dips to 4 in Bridge Collapse| publisher =Guardian Unlimited| date =[[2008-08-02]]| url =http://www.guardian.co.uk/uslatest/story/0,,-6822746,00.html| accessdate = 2007-08-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6927725.stm |title=Bid to recover Mississippi bodies |publisher=BBC |date=[[2007-08-02]] |accessdate=2007-08-02}}</ref>

The federal National Bridge Inventory database of inspection records show that the I-35W bridge ranked near the bottom of federal inspection ratings nationwide. The scale used was a "sufficiency rating" which ranges from the highest score, 100, to the lowest score, zero. A score below 80 indicates that some rehabilitation may be needed, while a score of 50 or less shows that replacement may be in order. This measure includes safety elements (such as structural integrity) and factors in elements such as the bridge's size with respect to its current traffic. The I-35W bridge was given a rating of 50 in the year 2005. Out of 104,348 heavily used bridge structures (those with more than 10,000 vehicles traveling on them per day), only 4,227, or 4%, scored below 50, according to an analysis of federal records by MSNBC. Although, on a separate measure, the I-35W bridge was rated "structurally deficient," it was deemed to have met "minimum tolerable limits to be left in place as it is."<ref name='mndot061005'/><ref name='mndot061506'/><ref>[[Bill Dedman]],{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20102713/ |title=I-35 bridge was rated among the nation's worst |publisher=MSNBC.com |date=[[2007-08-03]]- |accessdate=2007-08-03}}</ref>

In December 2006, a steel reinforcement project was planned for the bridge. However, the project was canceled in January 2007 in favor of periodic safety inspections, after it was revealed that drilling for the retrofitting would in fact weaken the bridge. In internal Mn/DOT documents, bridge officials talked about the possibility of the bridge collapsing and worried that it might have to be condemned.<ref name="Phone call">{{cite news | url=http://www.startribune.com/10204/story/1370130.html | title=Phone call put brakes on bridge repair |publisher=Star Tribune |date=[[2007-08-20]] |accessdate=2007-08-20}}</ref>

The construction taking place for the few weeks prior to the collapse was minor and cosmetic, focusing on replacing lighting, concrete and [[guard rail]]s and some work on joints. In the weeks before August, Mn/DOT's contractor, Progressive Contractors, Inc., conducted repairs on the surface of the bridge and, shortly before the incident, announced that it would reduce traffic flow on the bridge to one lane in each direction during the late evenings of [[July 31]] and [[August 1]] to accommodate construction. Progressive Contractors, Inc., was an experienced bridge and deck repair contractor that had previous experience working on the I-35W bridge.

Only a few of the vehicles were submerged, but many people were stranded on the collapsed sections of the bridge. Several involved vehicles caught fire, including a [[Sara Lee]] [[semi-truck]], whose driver's body was later pulled from the cab. When fire crews arrived they had to route hoses from several blocks away.<ref name="CNN080107a">[http://www.startribune.com/ Freeway bridge collapses into river during rush hour in Minneapolis], Minnesota Star Tribune, [[August 2]] [[2007]].</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/World/Minneapolis-bridge-collapses-six-dead/2007/08/02/1185648018526.html |title=Minneapolis bridge collapses, seven dead |publisher=The Age |date=[[2007-08-01]] |accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref><ref name="paul eickstadt">[http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2007/08/07/eickstadtobit/ Paul Eickstadt], by Matt Peiken, [[Minnesota Public Radio]], August 7, 2007</ref>

A [[school bus]] carrying 60 children from Waite House Neighborhood Center Day Camp ended up resting precariously against the guardrail of the collapsed structure, and also near the burning semi-trailer truck. They were returning from a [[field trip]] to a [[water park]]. Jeremy Hernandez, a 20-year-old staff member on the bus, assisted many of the children by kicking out the rear emergency exit and escorting or carrying them to safety. One youth worker was severely injured and ten of the children had minor injuries.<ref>[[Star Tribune]], [http://www.startribune.com/10204/story/1339495.html School Kids on crashed bus reunited with families], [[Star Tribune]], [[August 2]] [[2007]]</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=MacIntyre |first= April | publisher= Monsters and Critics | url=http://people.monstersandcritics.com/news/article_1338171.php |title=Hero Jeremy Hernandez saves 50+ children on I-35 bridge |date=[[2007-08-02]]- |accessdate=2007-08-12 }}</ref>

The families of the deceased, the survivors, and the first responders who were directly impacted by the bridge collapse—together estimated to be at least several hundred people—did not have United States disaster assistance for individuals. Sandy Vargas, president and CEO of the Minneapolis Foundation, one of seven foundations that form ''Minnesota Helps'', believes the ''Minnesota Helps Bridge Disaster Fund'' cannot cover the uninsured medical costs for the victims of the bridge collapse. The fund may be able to make small grants as a gesture of acknowledgment.<ref name=OConnor>{{cite news|author=O'Connor, Debra|title=How to give wisely after Minnesota's disasters|url=http://www.twincities.com/collapse/ci_6713803|work=Pioneer Press|publisher=MediaNews Group, Inc.|date=[[2007-08-24]]|accessdate=2007-08-25}}</ref>

In November 2007, District Judge Herbert Lefler of Hennepin County denied a request for access to complete information, which the state transportation department received from lawyers representing the victims. This information includes "data created and received in the course of the investigation of the I-35W bridge collapse".<ref>{{cite news|author=Olson, Rochelle|title=Judge: Victims' lawyers can't have access to collapsed bridge site|url=http://www.startribune.com/10241/story/1581493.html|date=[[November 29]], [[2007]]|work=Star Tribune|publisher=Avista Capital Partners|accessdate=2007-11-29}}</ref>

Pawlenty and his office, during the last week of November, announced a "$1 million plan" for the victims. State law has limits that may limit awards to below that amount. No legislative action was needed for this step. "The administration wanted approval from the Joint House-Senate Subcommittee on Claims as a sign of bipartisan support" which it received.<ref>{{cite news|author=Lohn, Martiga (The Associated Press)|title=Emergency aid approved for Minnesota bridge collapse victims|url=http://www.thedickinsonpress.com/ap/index.cfm?page=view&id=D8T7J5305|date=[[November 29]], [[2007]]|work=The Dickinson Press|publisher=Forum Communications|accessdate=2007-11-29}}</ref>

The FBI attempted to use a shoebox-sized sub that only had lights and a camera; its effectiveness is unknown. Minneapolis Police Captain Mike Martin stated that "The public safety divers are trained up to a level where they can kind of pick the low-hanging fruit. They can do the stuff that's easy.

National TV networks sent [[CBS]] anchor [[Katie Couric]], [[NBC]]'s [[Brian Williams]] and [[Matt Lauer]], [[MSNBC]]'s [[Contessa Brewer]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[Charlie Gibson]], [[CNN]]'s [[Soledad O'Brien]] and [[Anderson Cooper]], and [[Fox News]]' [[Greta Van Susteren]] and [[Shepard Smith]] to broadcast from the Twin Cities.<ref>{{cite news

U.S. news organizations interested in national and local bridge safety made a record number of requests for bridge information from Investigative Reporters and Editors, an organization which maintains several databases of federal information. News media made more inquiries for National Bridge Inventory data in the first 24 hours after the Minneapolis bridge collapse than for any previous data in the past 20 years.<ref>{{cite news

The [[BBC]] was present and provided one half hour of continuous, uninterrupted worldwide coverage at the end of the day of the collapse.

On [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] television on [[2007-08-15]], Peters said USDOT was opposed to raising the 18.4 cent federal gasoline tax, skeptical that the tax was the right vehicle for an upgrade of the nation's infrastructure. She offered sympathy and criticized communities by saying that 10 to 20 percent of transportation spending is on projects like restoring lighthouses, museums, bike paths, and trails, rather than on infrastructure.<ref>{{cite news|title=Transportation Secretary Discusses Concerns About National Infrastructure|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/transportation/july-dec07/infrastructure_08-15.html|work=the Online News Hour (pbs.org)|publisher=MacNeil/Lehrer Productions|date=originally aired [[2007-08-15]]|accessdate=2007-08-29}}</ref>

The replacement of the collapsed I-35W Mississippi River bridge will cross the Mississippi River at the same location as the original bridge, and will carry north-south traffic on Interstate Highway 35W. It is under construction on an accelerated schedule, due to the highway's function as a vital link for carrying commuters and [[truck|truck freight]].<ref name=rebuild>{{cite web| last =Scheck| first =Tom| title =Rebuild may begin in September| publisher =Minnesota Public Radio| date =[[2007-08-07]]| url =http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2007/08/07/capitol/| accessdate = 2007-08-08}}</ref> Mn/DOT announced on [[September 19]], [[2007]] that Flatiron Constructors and Manson Construction Company will build the [[St. Anthony Falls (35W) Bridge|replacement bridge]] for [[USD]] $234 million, to be completed no later than [[December 24]], [[2008]].<ref>{{cite web| last =Martiga Lohn| first =Martiga Lohn| title =Rich contract awarded for I-35W bridge replacement| publisher =Minnesota Public Radio|date=2007-09-19| url =http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2007/09/19/bridgebids/| accessdate =2007-09-19}}</ref>
