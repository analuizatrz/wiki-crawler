The '''Maniots''' (or '''Maniates'''; Greek: '''Μανιάτες''') are the [[Greeks|Greek]] inhabitants of the [[Mani Peninsula]] (the middle leg of the Peloponnese) located in the southern [[Peloponnese]] in the Greek [[Laconia|prefecture of Laconia]] and [[Messinia|prefecture of Messinia]]. They were also formerly known as '''Mainotes''' in [[English language|English]] and the peninsula as ''Maina''. Etymologically, the name "Maniot" means "one who comes from Mani". Geographically, the peninsula itself is an extension of the [[Taygetus]] mountain range. Modern Maniots claim descent from the ancient [[Lacedaemonians]] ([[Sparta]]ns). Throughout history, the Maniots have been known by their neighbors and their enemies as fearless warriors who practice [[Feud#Blood Feuds/Vendetta|blood feud]]s. 

As early as [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] times, the Maniots were also known as [[piracy|pirates]], as a result of lack of raw materials and resources, and insufficient capital for trade.{{Fact|date=April 2007}} For the most part, the Maniots lived in fortified villages (and "house-towers") where they defended their lands against the Ottomans and even against the armies of [[William II Villehardouin]].

==Ancient Mani== 
[[Image:SouthernPeloponessus.gif|left|thumb|250px|A map showing Classical Mani and Laconia.]]

===Mycenaean Mani===

[[Homer]]'s "[[Catalogue of ships]]" in the ''[[Iliad]]'' mentions the cities of Mani: Messi (Mezapos), Oetylus (Oitylo), Kardamili (or Skardamoula), Gerenia, Teuthone (Kotronas) and Las (Passavas).<ref name="Homer 2.581">[[#Homer|Homer]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hom.+Il.+2.581]</ref> Under the Mycenaeans, Mani flourished and a temple dedicated to the Greek god [[Apollo]] was built at Cape [[Tenaro]]. The temple was of such importance that it rivaled [[Delphi]] which was then a temple dedicated to [[Poseidon]]. Eventually, the temple of Tenaro was dedicated to Poseidon and the temple at Delphi was dedicated to Apollo. According to other legends, there is a cave near Tenaro that leads to [[Hades]]. Mani was also featured in other mythological tales such as the one where [[Helen of Troy]] and [[Paris]] spent their first night together on the island of [[Cranae]], off the coast of Gytheio.<ref name="Kassis7">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 7</ref>

In the [[12th century BC]], the [[Dorians]] invaded [[Laconia]]. The Dorians originally settled at [[Sparta]], but they soon started to expand their territory and by around [[800 BC]] they had taken over Mani and the rest of Laconia. Mani's inhabitants were given the social caste of [[Perioeci]].<ref name="Saitas13">Saitas, ''Mani", 13</ref> During that time, the [[Phoenicia]]ns came to Mani and were thought to have established a colony at [[Gythium]]. The Phoenicians built the colony at Gythium in order to collect [[murex]], a sea shell that was used to make purple dye and was plentiful in the Laconian Gulf.<ref name="Fermor"> Fermor.

===Classical Mani===

While the Spartans ruled Mani, Tenaro became an important gathering place for mercenaries.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos20">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 20</ref> Gythium became a major port under the Spartans as it was only 27 kilometres away from Sparta. In [[455 BC]], during the [[First Peloponnesian War]], it was besieged and captured by the Athenian [[admiral]], [[Tolmides]], along with 50 triremes and 4,000 hoplites.<ref name="Fermor"> Fermor. ''Mani: Travels in the Southern Peloponesse.'', 302 </ref> The city and the dockyards were rebuilt and by the late [[Peloponnesian War]], Gythium was the main building place for the new Spartan fleet.<ref>Xenophon, ''Hellenica'', 1, 4, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0206&layout=&loc=1.4.1 8–12].</ref> The Spartan leadership of the Peloponnese lasted until [[371 BC]], when the [[Thebes, Greece|Thebans]] under [[Epaminondas]] defeated them at [[Battle of Leuctra|Leuctra]]. The Thebans launched a campaign against Laconia and managed to capture Gythium after a three-day siege. The Thebans only briefly managed to hold Gythium, which was captured by 100 elite warriors posing as athletes.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos20">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 20</ref>

===Hellenistic Mani===

During the [[Hellenistic period]] of [[Greece]], Mani remained under Spartan control. The [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]] under the command of [[Philip V of Macedon]] invaded Mani and Laconia ([[219 BC]] - [[218 BC]]) and unsuccessfully besieged the cities of Gythium, [[Passavas|Las]] and [[Skoutari (Laconia), Greece|Asine]].<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos20">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 20</ref> When [[Nabis]] took over the Spartan throne in [[207 BC]], he implemented some reforms. One of these reforms entailed making Gythium into a major port and naval arsenal.<ref name="Green302">Green, ''Alexander to Actium: The Historical Evolution of the Hellenistic Age'', 302</ref> In [[195 BC]], during the [[Roman-Spartan War]], the [[Roman Republic]] and the [[Achaean League]] with assistance from a combined Pergamene and Rhodian force captured Gythium after a lengthy siege.<ref name="Livy 34.29">[[#Livy|Livy]] [http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy34.html 34.29]</ref>

The allies went on to besiege Sparta and forced Nabis to surrender. As part of the terms of the peace treaty, the coastal cities of Mani were liberated. The cities formed the [[Koinon of Free Laconians]] with Gythium as the capitol under Achaean protection.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos20">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 20</ref> Nabis not content with losing his land in Mani, built a fleet and strengthened his army and advanced upon Gythium in [[192 BC]].<ref>[[#William Smith|Smith]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104;query=id%3D%2312514;layout=;loc=]</ref> The Achaean League's army and navy under [[Philopoemen]], tried to relieve the city but the Achaean navy was defeated off Gythium and the army was forced to retreat to [[Tegea]].<ref>[[#William Smith|Smith]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104;query=id%3D%2312514;layout=;loc=]</ref> A Roman fleet under Atilius managed to re-capture Gythium later that year.

==Roman Mani==

The Maniots lived in peace until [[146 BC]] with the advent of the [[Battle of Corinth (146 BC)|Battle of Corinth]]. The conflict resulted in the destruction of [[Corinth]] by the forces of [[Lucius Mummius Achaicus]] and the annexation of the [[Achaean League]] by the [[Roman Republic]]. Even though the Romans conquered the Peloponnese, the Koinon was allowed to retain its independence. The Maniots suffered from pirate raids by Cretan and [[Cilicia]]ns who plundered Mani and pillaged the temple of [[Poseidon]]. The Maniots were delivered from the pirates when [[Pompey the Great]] defeated them. Most probably in gratitude, the Maniots supplied Pompey with archers in his battles against [[Julius Caesar]] during [[Caesar's civil war]] ([[49 BC]] - [[45 BC]]).<ref name="Kassis16">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 16</ref>

During the [[Civil war between Antony and Octavian]] ([[32 BC]] - [[30 BC]]), the Maniots and Laconians assisted [[Augustus]] by sending him men to join his navy. Augustus defeated [[Mark Antony]] and [[Cleopatra VII of Egypt]] at the [[Battle of Actium]] ([[September 2]], [[31 BC]]) and in gratitude he officially recognized the Koinon and visited [[Psammathous]], and it became a semi-independent state. This signified the beginning of the Golden Age of the Koinon.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos21">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 21</ref><ref name="Kassis16">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 16</ref>

Mani flourished under the Romans. The Koinon consisted of 24 cities (later 18), of which Gythium remained the most prominent. However, some parts of Mani remained under the also semi-independent Sparta, the most notable being Asine and Karymili.<ref name="Kassis16">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 16</ref> The Mani became a center for purple dye, which was popular in [[Rome]], as well as being well known for its rose antique marble and [[porphyry (geology)|porphyry]].<ref name="Fermor"> Fermor. ''Mani: Travels in the Southern Peloponesse.'', 302 </ref> Las is recorded to have been a comfortable city with Roman baths and a gymnasium.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos49">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 49</ref> 

[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias the geographer]] has left us a description of the town as it existed during the reign of [[Marcus Aurelius]] (reigned [[161]] - [[180]]). The agora, the Acropolis, the island of Cranae (Marathonisi) where Paris celebrated his nuptials with Helen of Troy, the Migonium or precinct of [[Aphrodite]] Migonitis (occupied by the modern town), and the hill Larysium (Koumaro) rising above it. Nowadays, the most noteworthy remains of the theatre and the buildings partially submerged by the sea all belong to the Roman period.<ref>[[#Pausanias|Pausanias]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Paus.+3.21.8 3.21.8]</ref>

The Koinon remained semi-independent until the provincial reforms of [[Roman Emperor]] [[Diocletian]] in [[297]]. With the [[Migration Period|barbarian invasion]] affecting the [[Roman Empire]], Mani became a haven for refugees. In [[375]], a massive earthquake in the area took its toll on Gythium, which was severely devastated.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos21">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 21</ref><ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos49">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 49</ref>

==Medieval Mani==

[[Image:ByzantineEmpire717AD2lightpurple.PNG|thumb|right|400px|A map of the Byzantine Empire showing Mani and the eastern Peloponnese as part of the Empire (the rest of the Peloponnese was occupied by Avars), ''c.'' 717.]]

===From Theodosius I to the Avar invasion===

On [[January 17]], [[395]], [[Theodosius I]], who had managed to unite the [[Roman Empire]] under his control, died. His eldest son, [[Arcadius]], succeeded him in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], while his younger son, [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]], received the [[Western Roman Empire]]. The Roman Empire had split for the last time, and Mani became part of the Eastern or [[Byzantine Empire]]. Between 395 and [[397]], [[Alaric I]] and his [[Visigoths]] plundered the [[Peloponnese]] and destroyed what was left of Gythium. Alaric captured the most famous cities, [[Corinth, Greece|Corinth]], [[Argos]], and [[Sparta]], selling many of their inhabitants into slavery. He was at last defeated by [[Stilicho]] and then crossed the [[Gulf of Corinth]] towards the north.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos21">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 21</ref>  

In [[468]], [[Gaiseric]] of the [[Vandals]] attempted to conquer Mani with the purpose of using it as a base to raid and then conquer the Peloponnese.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} Gaiseric tried to land his fleet at [[Kenipolis]], but as his army disembarked the inhabitants of the town attacked the Vandals and made them retreat after heavy casualties.<ref name="Fermor120">Fermor, ''Mani:Travels into the Southern Peloponnese", 120</ref> The Byzantine general [[Belisarius]], on the way to his campaign against the Vandals, stopped at Kenipolis to get supplies, honor the Kenipolitans for their victory, and recruit some soldiers.<ref name="Kassis19">Kassis, "Mani's History", 19</ref> According to Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, the [[Eurasian Avars]] (along with the [[Slavs]]) attacked and occupied most of the western Peloponnese in [[590]].<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos22">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 22</ref> However, there is no archaeological evidence for any Slavic (or Avar) penetration of imperial Byzantine territory before the end of the 6th century. Overall, traces of Slavic culture in Greece are very rare.<ref>"Slavs." Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium. Vol. 3, pp. 1917-1919.</ref>

===During the Macedonian dynasty===

There is a description of Mani and its inhabitants in [[Constantine VII]]'s [[De Administrando Imperio]]:

{{cquote|''Be it known that the inhabitants of [[Megali Maini|Castle Maina]] are not from the race of aforesaid [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] but from the older Romaioi, who up to the present time are termed Hellenes by the local inhabitants on account of their being in olden times idolaters and worshippers of idols like the ancient Greeks, and who were baptized and became Christians in the reign of the glorious [[Basil I|Basil]]. The place in which they live is waterless and inaccessible, but has olives from which they gain some consolation.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos22">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 22</ref>}} 

The area inhabited by the Maniates was first called by the name "Maina" and was associated with the castle of [[Tigani]]. The Maniots at that time were called "Hellenes"--that is, [[paganism|pagans]] (see [[Names of the Greeks]])--and were only [[Christianization|Christianized]] fully in the [[9th century]] AD, though some church ruins from the [[4th century]] AD indicate that [[Christianity]] was practiced by some Maniots in the region at an earlier time. The Maniots were the last inhabitants of Greece to openly follow the pagan [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] religion. This can be explained by the mountainous nature of Mani's terrain, which enabled them to escape the attempts of the Eastern Roman Empire to Christianize Greece by force.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos22">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 22</ref>

===Under the Principality of Achaea===

During the [[Fourth Crusade]] ([[1201]] - [[1204]]), the Crusaders captured [[Constantinople]]. The Eastern Roman Empire was partitioned between several Greek and Latin successor states, notably including (from west to east) the [[Despotate of Epirus]], the [[Latin Empire]], the [[Empire of Nicaea]], and the [[Empire of Trebizond]]. These four empires produced rival emperors, struggling for control over each other and the rest of the semi-independent states emerging in the area. [[William of Champlitte]] and [[Geoffrey I Villehardouin]] defeated the Peloponnesian Greeks at the [[Battle of the Olive Grove of Koundouros]] ([[1205]]), and the Peloponnese became the [[Principality of Achaea]]. In [[1210]], Mani was given to Baron [[Jean de Neuilly]] as [[Hereditary Marshal]], and he built the castle of [[Passavas]] on the ruins of Las. The castle occupied a significant position, as it controlled an important pass from Gythium to [[Oitylo]] and contained the Maniots.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos23">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 23</ref><ref name="Kassis23">Kassis, "Mani's History", 23</ref>

The Maniots, however, were not easily contained, and they were not the only threat to the Frankish occupation of the Peloponnese. The [[Melengi]], a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] tribe in the [[Taygetus]] [[mountain range]], raided Laconia from the west, and the [[Tsakonians]] also resisted the Franks. In [[1249]], the new prince, [[William II of Villehardouin]], acted against the raiders. He used the newly captured fortress of [[Monemvasia]] to keep the Tsakones at bay, and he built the castle at [[Mystras]] in the Taygetus mountains overlooking Sparta in order to contain the Melengi. To stop the Maniot raids, he built the castle of [[Megali Maini]], which is most probably [[Tigani]]. It is described as ''at a fearful cliff with a headland above''. A Latin bishop was appointed for Mani during the [[1250s]]. In [[1259]], the bishop was captured during the [[Battle of Pelagonia]] by the renewed Byzantine Empire under the leadership of Nicaea.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos24">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 24</ref>

===Under the Despotate of Morea===

[[Image:ShepherdByzempire1265.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Map showing the Byzantine Empire in 1265.]]

On [[July 25]], [[1261]], the Byzantines under [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] recaptured Constantinople. Prince William was set free, on the condition that he had to surrender the fortresses of Megali Maina, Mystras, and Monemvasia, as well as surrender hostages including Lady Margaret, Baroness of Passavas. With the Franks gone from Laconia, the Maniots lived in peace under the [[Despotate of Morea]], whose successive [[Despotes]] governed the province. Mani seems to have been dominated by the Nikliani family, who were refugees. However, the peace was terminated when the Ottoman Turks started their attacks on the Peloponnese.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos24">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 24</ref>{{hcref|α|Social castes of Mani}}

==Ottoman times==

[[Image:Ottoman.jpg|left|thumb|275px|Map of the Ottoman Empire.]]

===15th century===
After the [[Ottoman Empire]] under [[Mehmet II|Sultan Mehmet II]] [[Fall of Constantinople|took Constantinople]] in May [[1453]], Mani remained under the control of the Despotate of Morea. In May [[1460]], Mehmet occupied the Peloponnese. The Despotate of Morea had been ruled by the two brothers of [[Constantine XI]], who had died defending Constantinople. However, neither [[Demetrios Palaiologos]] nor [[Thomas Palaiologos]] chose to follow his example and defend the Peloponnese. Instead, Thomas fled to [[Italy]], while Demetrios sought refuge with Mehmet. [[Helena Palaiologina]], a daughter of Demetrios and Theodora Asanina, was given in marriage to Mehmet II.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos24">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 24</ref> 
	
Kladas, a Greek from Laconia, was granted lordship by Mehmet over [[Elos]] and Varvounia in [[1461]]. Mehmet hoped that Kladas would defend Laconia from the Maniots.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos24">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 24</ref> During that time, Mani's population grew as a result of an influx of refugees who came from other areas of Greece.<ref name="Kassis38">Kassis, "Mani's History", 38</ref>{{hcref|β|Population of Mani}} In [[1463]], Kladas turned against the Ottomans and joined the Venetians. He led the Maniots against the Ottomans with Venetian aid until [[1479]], when the Venetians made peace with the Ottomans and gave the Ottomans the right to rule ''Brazzo di Maina''. Kladas refused to accept the conditions, and so the Venetians put a price on his head.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos24">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 24</ref>

After the end of the Turco-Venetian War, the Venetians left the Maniots to fend for themselves. Many of the Greeks who had revolted alongside the Venetians were massacred by the Ottomans, but many of them fled to find refuge in Mani. The Maniots continued to resist, and Mehmet sent an army of 2,000 infantry and 300 cavalry against Mani under the command of Ale Boumico.<ref name="Kassis28">Kassis, "Mani's History", 28</ref> The Venetians, trying to gain favor with the Porte, handed over some Maniot rebels. The Ottomans reached Oitylo before Kladas, and the Maniots attacked and massacred them. Only a few escaped; amongst them was Ale Boumico. Kladas invaded the Laconian plain with 14,000 Maniots and killed the Turkish inhabitants.<ref name="Kassis29">Kassis, "Mani's History", 29</ref>

A month later, a larger force under the command of [[Ahmed Bey]] invaded Mani and drove Kladas to [[Porto Kagio]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zorbas.de/maniguide/turkok.html |title=Turkokratia: Kladas Revolt

===16th century===

From [[1500]] to [[1570]], Mani kept its autonomy without any invasion from the Ottomans.<ref name="Kassis29">Kassis, "Mani's History", 29</ref> The Ottomans were busy driving the Venetians out of the Peloponnese and succeeded in [[1540]], when they conquered Monemvasia and [[Nafplio]]. The Ottomans under [[Selim II]], preparing to invade the Venetian island of [[Cyprus]], built a fortress in Mani, at Porto Kagio, and they also garrisoned Passavas. The aim of this was to cut off the Venetians' communication lines and to keep the Maniots at bay. Alarmed, the Maniots called upon Venetian assistance, and the Venetian navy in combination with the Maniot army captured the castle.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos25">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 25</ref> 

Cyprus fell later that year, but the combined fleets of the [[Holy League (Mediterranean)|Holy League]] defeated the Ottoman fleet at the [[Battle of Lepanto]] ([[1571]]). The Greeks assumed that [[John of Austria]] would champion their revolt under the command of the bishop of Monemvasia.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos25">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 25</ref> The promised army never arrived, and by [[1572]] the bishop was forced to retreat to Mani. The Maniots failed when they appealed to [[Pope Gregory VIII]] to convince [[Philip II of Spain]] in providing military support.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos26">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 26</ref>

===17th century===

In [[1603]], the Maniots approached [[Pope Clement VIII]], who had recently taken up the [[crusade|cross]]. Clement died two years later, and the Maniots began to seek a new champion, centering their attention on the King of Spain, [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]].<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos26">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 26</ref> They urged him to land his army at Porto Kagio and promised to join him with 15,000 armed men as well as 80,000 other Peloponnesians.<ref name="Kassis29">Kassis, "Mani's History", 29</ref> The Maniots also sent envoys to some major powers of the Mediterranean, as for example the [[Republic of Venice]], the [[Ancien Régime in France|Kingdom of France]], the [[Republic of Genoa]], the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]], and once again [[Spain]]. These states were interested and sent several expeditionary forces to Mani, but with the exception of a Spanish expedition that sacked Passavas they all failed to achieve anything.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos26">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 26</ref>

The Maniots found a champion in [[1612]], [[Charles Gonzaga]], Duke of Mantua and Nevers. Charles was a descendant of the Byzantine Emperor [[Andronicus II Palaeologus]] through his grandmother, who was of the line of [[Theodore I of Montferrat]], Andronicus' son.<ref name="Kassis30">Kassis, "Mani's History", 30</ref> Through this connection he claimed the throne of Constantinople. He began plotting with the Maniots, who addressed him as ''King Constantine Palaeologus''. When the Porte heard about this, they sent Arslan in command of an army of 20,000 men and 70 ships to invade Mani. He succeeded in ravaging Mani and imposing taxes on the Maniots (which they did not pay). This caused Nevers to move more actively for his crusade. Nevers sent envoys to the courts of Europe looking for support. In [[1619]], he recruited six ships and a number men, but he was forced to abort the mission because of the beginning of the [[Thirty Years' War]].<ref name="Kassis30">Kassis, "Mani's History", 30<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos26">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 26</ref>The idea of the crusade faded and Nevers died in 1637.<ref name="Kassis30">Kassis, "Mani's History", 30</ref>

In [[1645]], the [[Turkish-Venetian War]] or "Cretan War" began. The Republic of Venice was attempting to defend [[Crete]], one of their provinces since 1204, from an attempt to expand the Ottoman Empire, initially under [[Ibrahim I]]. The Maniots supported the Venetians by offering them ships. In [[1659]], Admiral [[Francesco Morosini]], with 13,000 Maniots as his allies, occupied [[Kalamata]], a large city near Mani. In 1667, during the [[Siege of Candia]], some Maniot pirate ships sneaked into the Ottoman fleet and managed to loot and burn some ships. However, Candia fell in 1669, and Crete became part of the Ottoman Empire.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos26">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 26</ref><ref name="Kassis30">Kassis, "Mani's History", 30</ref>{{hcref|γ|Refugees}}

With Crete captured, the Ottomans turned their attention to Mani. The [[Grand Vizier]], [[Köprülü Fazıl Ahmet Pasha]], sent the pirate [[Hasan Baba]] to subdue Mani. Baba arrived in Mani demanding that the Maniots surrender hostages, but instead he was answered with bullets. During the night, ten Maniots went and cut the hawsers of Hasan's ships. This caused some of Baba's ships to founder on some rocks, and the Maniots, taking advantage of the situation, attacked and killed the Turks and seized the ships. Baba managed to escape with only one ship.<ref name="Kassis30-1">Kassis, "Mani's History", 30-1</ref>

In the prisons of [[Bagno]], there was a notorious twenty-five-year-old Maniot pirate named [[Liberakis Gerakis]]. At the age of fifteen, he was in the Venetian galleys as a rower. After being released by the Venetians, he continued piracy and was captured by the Turks in [[1667]]. The Grand Vizier decided to give him amnesty if he cooperated with the Turks and helped them conquer Mani. Gerakis agreed and in [[1670]] became the bey of Mani. One of Gerakis' first acts was to exile his clan's enemies, the Iatriani family and the Stephanopoulos family from Oitylo. The Iatriani fled in [[1670]] and settled in [[Livorno]], [[Tuscany]]. The Stephanopoulos clan was forced to leave Oitylo in [[1676]], and after having gained permission from the [[Republic of Genoa]], went to [[Corsica]]. The Stephanopoulos family first lived in the town of [[Paomia]] before moving to [[Cargese]], and to this day consider themselves Greeks.<ref name="Kassis31">Kassis, "Mani's History", 31</ref>{{hcref|δ|Immigration from Mani}}

Liberakis soon fell out of favor with the Turks since he joined his fellow Maniots in piracy and was captured in [[1682]].<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos27">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 27</ref> With Ottoman forces preoccupied with the Austrians, the Venetians under Morosini saw their opportunity to take over Turkish-held territories in the Peloponnese. The Turkish general in the Peloponnese, [[Ismael]], discovered this plan and attacked Mani with 10,000 men. The Turks ravaged the plains, but during the night the Maniots attacked and killed 1,800 Turks. The other Turks retreated to the castles of Kelefa and Zarnatas, where they were besieged by the Maniots. After brief sieges, the Maniots managed to capture both [[Koroni]] and Kelefa. However, Ismael returned with 10,000 infantry and 2,500 artillery and started besieging the Maniots at Kelefa. The Turks nearly succeeded in breaching the walls before 4,500 Venetians under the command of Morosini arrived and forced the Turks to retreat to [[Kastania]] with the Maniots in pursuit.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos28">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 28</ref><ref name="Kassis32">Kassis, "Mani's History", 32</ref>

The Venetians, with assistance of the Greeks, conquered the rest of the [[Peloponnese]] and then besieged [[Athens]]. During the siege of Athens, the Ottomans were using the Parthenon as an ammunition depot. When artillery fire from the Venetians struck the depot, the resulting explosion damaged large portions of the Parthenon.<ref name="Kassis32">Kassis, "Mani's History", 32</ref> The desperate Ottomans freed Liberakis and gave him the title ''His Highness, the Ruler of Mani''. Liberakis immediately launched several raids into Venetian-held territories of the Peloponnese. However, when the Ottomans attempted to poison Liberakis, he defected to the Venetian side.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos29">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 29</ref><ref name="Kassis33">Kassis, "Mani's History", 33</ref> The Venetians made Liberakis a Knight of St. Mark and recognized him as ruler of [[Roumeli]]. Liberakis first attacked the city of [[Arta]], where the Ottomans destroyed his estates at [[Karpenisi]]. He captured and plundered the city before going back to Mani. The Arteans sent a committee to Venice and reported everything to the [[Doge]]. Ultimately, Liberakis moved to Italy, where he died fourteen years later. Meanwhile, Manos Maneas, a Maniot trader, told German traders of a rising power in the [[Balkans]] and of a ''golden race'' that would defeat the Ottomans. In these conversations, Maneas was specifically referring to the [[Russian Empire]] under the leadership of [[Peter the Great]].<ref name="Kassis33">Kassis, "Mani's History", 33</ref>

===18th century===

In [[1715]], the Ottomans attacked the Peloponnese and managed to drive out the Venetians within seventy days. The Venetians won some minor naval battles off Mani but abandoned the Greeks in [[1716]]. The next year, the [[Treaty of Passarowitz]] was signed, and the Venetians abandoned their claim to the Peloponnese.<ref name="Kassis34">Kassis, "Mani's History", 34</ref> 

====Orlov Revolt====
{{main|Orlov Revolt}}

Papazolis, a Greek living in Russia, was a friend of the [[Orlov]]s and had them convince [[Catherine the Great]] to send an army to Mani and liberate Greece.<ref name="Kassis34">Kassis, "Mani's History", 34</ref> A Russian fleet of five ships and 500 soldiers under the command of [[Aleksey Grigoryevich Orlov]] sailed from the [[Baltic Sea]] in [[1769]] and reached Mani in [[1770]].<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos29">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 29</ref> The fleet landed at Oitylo, where it was met by the Maniots. It was decided to split the army into two groups, the ''Western Legion'' and the ''Eastern Legion''. The Eastern Legion, under the command of [[Barkof]], [[Grigorakis]], and [[Psaros]], consisted of 500 Maniots and six Russians. The Western Legion, under the command of [[John Mavromichalis]] (nicknamed ''the Dog''), [[Dolgorougoph]], and [[Komoundouros]], consisted of 200 Maniots and twelve Russians.<ref name="Kassis34">Kassis, "Mani's History", 34</ref> 

Meanwhile, the Russian fleet was besieging [[Koroni]] with assistance from the Western Legion. The siege proved to be difficult, and soon Orlov got into a dispute with John the Dog. Mavromichalis stated to Orlov that if they wanted to start a real war, they had to occupy Koroni, and that if they did not, they should not excite the Greeks in vain. Orlov replied by calling the Maniots ''ragged'' and ''rude booty men''.<ref name="Kassis34">Kassis, "Mani's History", 34</ref> To this, Mavromichalis replied, ''The last of these ragged booty men keeps his freedom with his own sword and deserves more than you, slave of a whore!''<ref name="Kassis35">Kassis, "Mani's History", 35</ref> The Russians left and conducted their own operations until the end of the year, when they ultimately sailed back to Russia.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos29">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 29</ref>

The Eastern Legion met with success when it defeated an army of 3,500 Turks.<ref name="Kassis34">Kassis, "Mani's History", 34</ref> The Ottomans responded to this by sending 8,000 Turko-Albanians to invade the Peloponnese. The Turko-Albanians first plundered [[Attica]] before entering the Peloponnese. Upon ravaging the Peloponnese, the Turko-Albanians reached [[Rizomylo]] in Messenia, where they were blocked by John Mavromichalis and 400 of his followers. The Maniots held them off for a while, but the Turko-Albanians eventually won due to their superior numbers. They captured John Mavromichalis, who was not only seriously wounded but also the last survivor of the battle. He was ultimately tortured to death. The Turko-Albanians then invaded Mani and began ravaging the land near [[Almiro]]. During the night, an army of 5,000 Maniot men and women attacked the Turko-Albanians while they slept and routed them. The Turko-Albanians lost 1,700, while the Maniots only suffered thirty-nine casualties.<ref name="Kassis35">Kassis, "Mani's History", 35</ref>

In [[1776]], the Ottomans appointed a Maniot, Zanetos Koutifaris, as bey of Mani.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos30">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 30</ref>{{hcref|ε|Beys of Mani}} They also tried to impose a tax of 15,000 piasters on the Maniots, which the Maniots did not pay. The Porte no longer tolerated the Turko-Albanians because of the way they looted the Peloponnese. Hassán Ghazi, the Turkish bey of the Peloponnese, in collaboration with Greek klephts under the command of [[Constantinos Kolokotronis]] (father of [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]]), killed most of the Turko-Albanians in the Peloponnese and made a pyramid out of their heads.<ref name="Kassis36">Kassis, "Mani's History", 36</ref> In [[1779]], the Ottomans had had enough of Koutifaris, who was attempting to extend his beydom into the Laconian plain, and they had him executed. He was replaced by [[Michalis Troupakis]].<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos30">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 30</ref>

====Ottoman Invasion of Mani (1780)====
{{main|Ottoman Invasion of Mani (1780)}}

Around [[1780]], Hassán Ghazi with 16,000 men besieged the two towers in Kastania. The defenders were [[Constantinos Kolokotronis]] and [[Panagiotes Venetsanakis]] with 150 men and women. The fight lasted for twelve days: most of the defenders were killed, and all prisoners of war were tortured and dismembered. The wife of Constantine Kolokotronis was dressed like a warrior and fought her way carrying her baby, [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]], the future leader of the Greek War of Independence.<ref name="Πουμελιωτη31"> Πουμελιωτη, "Ηρωίδες της Λακωνίας και της Μάνης Όλης (1453-1944), 31</ref>

[[Image:Mani Towers.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Maniot towers like the one that held off the Turks at Skoutari.]]

From Kastania, Hassán Ghazi advanced towards [[Skoutari (Laconia), Greece|Skoutari]] and laid siege to the tower of the powerful Grigorakis clan. The tower contained fifteen men, who held out for three days until the Turks placed gunpowder in a mine and blew up the overall garrison. By this time, the main Maniot army of 5,000 men and 2,000 women had established a defensive position at Trikefalia, which was on mountainous terrain above the town of [[Parasyros]]. The entire army was under the command of [[Exarchos Grigorakis]] and his nephew [[Zanetos Grigorakis]]. The Ottoman army advanced to the plain of Agio Pigada (Greek: 'Holy Wells'). They sent envoys to the Maniots telling them that Hassán wanted to negotiate. The Maniots knew that if they sent envoys to the Turks, they would be executed by Hassán if the negotiations failed. The Maniots sent six men to discuss the terms.<ref name="Kassis35">Kassis, "Mani's History", 35</ref>

Six Maniot envoys were sent to Hassán and, without bowing, asked him what he wanted. Hassán's demands entailed the children of ten captains as hostages, all Maniot-held arms, and an annual head-tax to be paid  as punishment for supporting the Russians. The Maniots answered Hassán's demands saying, ''We prefer to die rather than give to you our guns and children. We don't pay taxes, because our land is poor.'' Hassán became furious and had the six men decapitated and impaled on stakes so that the Maniots could see them.<ref name="Kassis36">Kassis, "Mani's History", 36</ref>

After the envoys were killed, the remaining Maniots attacked the Ottomans. The fighting was fierce, and only 6,000 Turks managed to reach Mystras. No one knew exactly how many casualties the Maniots suffered, but the Turks definitively lost 10,000 men.<ref name="Kassis36">Kassis, "Mani's History", 36</ref> Hassán tried to weaken the Grigorakis family by inviting Exarchos to Tripolis. He treated him as an honored guest but then had him hung.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos30">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 30</ref> On Easter Sunday, Exarchos' mother incited the men of Skoutari to take revenge for the death of her son.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos51">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 51</ref> Under the command of Zanetos, the men of Skoutari dressed as priests and were allowed into Passavas. Once inside, the Skoutariotes took out their concealed weapons and killed all the inhabitants of Passavas.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos52">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 52</ref>

In [[1782]], the Ottomans lured [[Michalis Troupakis]] onto a ship and sent him to [[Mytilini]], where he was executed for piracy. The Porte tried to get Zanetos to replace him, but Zanetos refused until he was lured onto a ship and forced to become a bey.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos31">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 31</ref>

====Katsonis====

During Zanetos' rule, Mani became a base for many [[klephts]] and other Greek bandits. Among them was the famous Greek pirate [[Lambros Katsonis]], who helped the Russians in their wars against the Ottomans, [[Andreas Androutsos]], (father of [[Odysseas Androutsos|Odysseas]]), and [[Zacharias]].<ref name="Kassis37">Kassis, "Mani's History", 37</ref> On [[January 9]], [[1792]], [[Catherine II of Russia]] had her representative [[Alexander Bezborodko]] sign the [[Treaty of Jassy]] with [[Grand Vizier]] [[Koca Yusuf Pasha]] of the Ottoman Empire. The treaty ended the [[Russo-Turkish War]], recognized Russia's [[1783]] annexation of the [[Crimean Khanate]], and transferred [[Yedisan]] to Russia, making the [[Dniester]] the Russo-Turkish frontier in [[Europe]] while leaving the [[Asia]]tic frontier ([[Kuban River]]) unchanged.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos140">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 140</ref> Lambros Katsonis said, ''Aikaterini (Greek: Catherine) made her treaty, but Katsonis didn't make his treaty with the enemy.''<ref name="Kassis37">Kassis, "Mani's History", 37</ref>

Katsonis, together with Androutsos and Zacharias, built a gun battery at Porto Kagio. He gathered a small army and a navy of eleven ships and attacked Ottoman ships in the area. However, not being able to maintain his ships, he started attacking ships from other countries. Later that year, he sank two French ships, which was the beginning of the end for Katsonis. An Ottoman fleet of thirty ships and a French destroyer attacked Katsonis at Porto Kagio. Katsonis' men fled to land; Katsonis himself escaped to [[Odessa]] on one of the ships.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos140">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 140</ref>

Androutsos with 500 men tried to cross the Peloponnese and enter Roumeli. Zacharias in a rear-guard action managed to help fight his way through the Peloponnese and into Roumeli.<ref name="Kassis37">Kassis, "Mani's History", 37</ref> In [[1798]], [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]], at the time a general serving in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] under the orders of the [[French Directory]], sent two members of the Stephanopoulos family to Mani in order to convince the Maniots to attack the Ottomans from the Peloponnese while he attacked from [[Egypt]]. Zacharias and Zanetbey accepted the offer, and Napoleon sent them weapons. When the Turks discovered this, they had Zanetos replaced as bey with Panagiotis Koumoundourakis.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos31">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 31</ref>

==Modern Mani==
===Early 19th century===

In [[Ottoman Invasion of Mani (1803)|1803]], the Ottomans deposed Koumoundourakis, because he was not capable of subduing Zanetbey, who was still receiving weapons from the French at his castle at [[Cranae]]. The Ottomans replaced him with Antony or Antonbey, Zanetbey's cousin.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos31">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 31</ref> The Turkish fleet under the command of the [[admiral]] [[Seremet]],<ref name="Kassis37">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 37</ref> was unable to capture Cranae and was soon forced to retreat.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos31">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 31</ref> 

In [[1805]], Seremet attacked Zacharias at his fortress in the [[Taygetus]] mountains and managed to kill him.<ref name="Kassis37">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 37</ref> In [[Ottoman Invasion of Mani (1807)|1807]], the Ottomans attacked Antonbey at [[Gytheio]], because he was unwilling to suppress his cousin, who was still attacking the Turks. The Turks were once again forced to retreat. Three years later, Antonbey resigned in favor of his son-in-law, Konstantis Zervakos, who was favorable to the bey of the Peloponnese. However, the Maniots did not agree with the Ottomans' choice and deposed Zervakos.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos32">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 32</ref> 

Later that year, the Maniot leaders gathered at Gytheio and elected Theodoros Zanerakis or Theodorobey, Zanetbey's nephew, as bey. In [[Ottoman Invasion of Mani (1815)|1815]], the Ottomans attacked Mani but were driven back.<ref name="Kassis38">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 38</ref> Theodorobey was removed from power later that year and was replaced by [[Petros Mavromichalis]] or Petrobey.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos32">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 32</ref>

Petros Mavromichalis was John the Dog's nephew. He was the first Maniot bey from [[Messa Mani]].<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos32">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 32</ref> In 1798, he had also been approached by Napoleon to join the war on the Ottomans, but after the failure of the [[French invasion of Egypt (1798)|French invasion of Egypt]], Petros joined the French army for a while and fought in the [[Ionian Islands]]. It was rumored at the time that he was appointed bey only because his uncle was not killed, had converted to Islam, and had become an officer in the Ottoman army. In [[1819]], he joined the [[Filiki Eteria]], which by 1821 was prepared to revolt.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos33">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 33</ref>

===Contributions to the Greek Revolution===

[[Image:Theodoros Kolokotronis.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Theodoros Kolokotronis, a leader of the Revolution.]]

Maniots, known for their martial qualities, were the first to join the Greek liberation movement. The society called the [[Filiki Eteria]] ("Friendly Company") sent their representatives Perrevos and Chrisospathis to organize the Maniots.<ref name="Paroulakis40">Paroulakis, ''The Greeks: Their Struggle for Independence", 40</ref> On [[March 17]], [[1821]], 12,000 Maniots gathered in the church of the Taxiarchs (Archangels) of Areopolis and declared war against the Ottoman Empire.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos58">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 58</ref> The flag of the revolution was white with a blue cross in the center. Atop the flag was the motto "[[Victory or death]]". The Maniots were responsible for writing "Victory" and not "Freedom" on their banner, since Mani was always free. At the bottom of the flag was an ancient inscription, "With the shield or on the shield."<ref name="Kassis39">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 39</ref>

On [[March 21]], an army of 2,000 Maniots under the command of Petros Mavromichalis, [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]], and [[Papaflessas]] marched towards [[Kalamata]]. On [[March 23]], they captured the city.<ref name="Kassis39">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 39</ref> From Kalamata, Mavromichalis wrote letters to the states of [[Europe]], informing them of what the Greeks were doing. The Messenian Senate was also held in Kalamata. Kolokotronis wanted to attack Tripolis and capture the main Turkish city in the Peloponnese. However, Mavromichalis wanted to capture the smaller towns first and then take Tripolis. The Senate agreed with Mavromichalis, and the Maniots attacked the Turks of Messenia and Laconia.<ref name="Paroulakis58">Paroulakis, ''The Greeks: Their Struggle for Independence", 58</ref> 

Kolokotronis, convinced that he was correct, moved into [[Arcadia]] with 300 Maniots. When he entered Arcadia his band of 300 fought a Turkish force of 1,300 men and defeated them.<ref name="Kassis39">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 39</ref> On [[April 28]], a few thousand Maniot soldiers under the command of Mavromichalis' sons joined Kolokotronis' camp outside Tripolis. On [[September 12]], 1821, the Turkish capital in the Peloponnese fell. On [[July 4]], Kyriakoulis Mavromichalis was killed near the [[Suli|Souliote]] fortress of [[Kaiapha]].

[[Mahmud II]] became desperate and in [[1824]] called on his [[Viceroy]], [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]], to aid him. Ali promised to aid him in return for the islands of [[Crete]] and [[Cyprus]], as well as making his eldest son, [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt]], pasha of the [[Peloponnese]]. Ali accepted the offer and sent his son in command of the expedition. Meanwhile, the Greeks were in disarray because of political rivalries, which caused a civil war. Kolokotronis was arrested, his son [[Panos Kolokotronis|Panos]] was killed, and his nephew [[Nikitaras]] fled.<ref name="Paroulakis113">Paroulakis, ''The Greeks: Their Struggle for Independence", 113</ref> 

Ibrahim made good use of this turmoil and landed with his army at [[Methoni]]. Ibrahim soon had recaptured the Peloponnese except for [[Nafplio]] and Mani. When he tried to capture Nafplio, he was repelled by [[Dimitrios Ypsilantis]] and [[Konstantinos Mavromichalis]], Petros' brother.<ref name="Paroulakis125">Paroulakis, ''The Greeks: Their Struggle for Independence", 125</ref> 

Ibrahim then decided to head for Mani. Ibrahim sent an envoy to the Maniots demanding that they surrender or else he would ravage their land. Instead of surrendering, the Maniots replied:

''From the few Greeks of Mani and the rest of Greeks who live there to Ibrahim Pasha. We received your letter in which you try to frighten us saying that if we don't surrender, you'll kill the Maniots and plunder Mani. That's why we are waiting for you and your army. We, the inhabitants of Mani, sign and await you.''<ref name="Kassis39">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 39</ref>

Enraged by the reply, Ibrahim, commanding an army of 7,000 men, attacked Mani on [[June 21]], [[1826]].<ref name="Kassis40">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 40</ref> He was stopped at the walls of [[Almiro]] and [[Vergas Mani|Vergas]], which ran for around 500 meters.<ref name="Saitis12">Saitis, ''Mani", 12</ref> Defending the walls were 2,000 Maniots under the command of Ilias Mavromichalis and 500 Greek refugees.<ref name="Kassis40">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 40</ref><ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos62">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 62</ref> As Ibrahim launched his infantry and cavalry against the Maniot position, he also ordered two of his ships, including the one he was on, to attack the Maniot fortifications from the sea with their artillery. The Egyptian army attacked the Maniot position eight times and was thrown back.<ref name="Kassis40">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 40</ref> The fighting continued for a few more days before the Egyptians retreated when rumors that Kolokotronis was approaching their rear with 2,000 men proved true.<ref name="Barrow21">Barrow, ''The Mani", 21</ref> The Maniots pursued the Egyptians all the way to Kalamata before returning to Vergas. This battle not only was costly for Ibrahim, who suffered 2,500 casualties, but also ruined his plan to invade Mani from the north.<ref name="Kassis39">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 39</ref><ref name="Kassis40">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 40</ref>

While Ibrahim was launching his attack on the Maniot position at Vergas, he decided to launch a small fleet and attack [[Areopolis]]. This plan was described by Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos as ''excellent'' because it would catch Areopolis by surprise since it was ill defended. By capturing Areopolis, Ibrahim could cut off the Maniot communication lines and control the mountain passes that led to [[Gytheio]]. This would also allow the Egyptians to attack the Maniots at Vergas from the rear.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos62">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 62</ref>

On [[June 24]], Ibrahim sent a small fleet carrying 1,500 troops to land at the Bay of Diros and capture Areopolis.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos62">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 62</ref> As the Egyptians landed on the beach, the alarm bells rang.<ref name="Kassis40">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 40</ref> Soon, 300 women and old men who had been harvesting the crops gathered and, armed only with their scythes and cudgels, charged at the Egyptians. The Egyptians, not expecting any resistance, were caught by surprise at this sudden attack and were forced to retreat to a fortified position on the beach where they could receive support from their ships. Eventually, 300 Maniots arrived from other towns, and the Egyptians were forced to either swim to their ships or be slain.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos62">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 62</ref> Not only was Ibrahim's defeat costly, as he lost 1,000 men, but his plan to invade and conquer Mani was utterly ruined. Later on, the women of Diro were dubbed the 'Amazons of Diro'.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos63">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 63</ref>

Ibrahim, annoyed by his defeats at Vergas and Diro, plundered the Peloponnese for a month before turning his attention back to Mani. He sent an army of 6,000 Arabs to advance to the Taygetus and capture Gytheio and Laconian Mani. In command of the army was a Greek from Vordonia, [[Bosinas]]. As he advanced towards Polytsaravo, he was stopped by Theodoros Stathakos, who together with his family of thirteen people was waiting in their tower. Bosinas tried to make Stathakos surrender, and when the latter feigned surrender, Bosinas came towards the tower. However, once Bosinas was within range, Stathakos and his army killed him. In retaliation, Bosinas' army shot at the tower with their cannons and destroyed it.<ref name="Kassis41">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 41</ref>

The Egyptians then proceeded towards the town of Polytsaravos and reached it on [[August 28]]. The inhabitants of the town had sent the women and children to take refuge in the mountains before improving the fortifications they had there. The town militia was reinforced by other Maniots, and soon the defenders numbered 2,500 men.<ref name="Kassis41">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 41</ref> The Egyptians had trouble advancing to Polytsaravos, because it was surrounded by rocks situated on high ground.<ref name="Barrow102">Barrow, ''The Mani", 102</ref> As soon as the Arabs arrived, the Maniots rallied around their fortifications and attacked the Arabs. The Arabs retreated from Polytsaravos after sustaining 400 casualties while the Maniots only suffered nine.<ref name="Kassis41">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 41</ref> This was the last invasion of Mani by the Egyptians or the Ottomans as the Peloponnese, central Greece, and some of the Aegean islands were liberated in [[1828]] after the naval forces of [[Bourbon Restoration]] France under [[Henri de Rigny]], the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] under [[Edward Codrington]], and the [[Russian Empire]] under [[Login Geiden]] defeated Ibrahim at the [[Battle of Navarino|Navarino]] in [[1827]].

===Republic and Regency===
[[Image:30septgrece2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Map of the boundaries of the Greek Kingdom after the Treaty of Constantinople.]]

In [[1831]], [[Ioannis Capodistrias]] became governor of Greece.<ref name="Kassis41">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 41</ref> Capodistrias quarreled with the Mavromichalis clan because the Maniots refused to pay taxes to the government.<ref name="Paroulakis165">Paroulakis, ''The Greeks: Their Struggle for Independence", 165</ref> Capodistrias requested that [[Tzanis Mavromichalis|Tzanis]], Petros' brother, go to [[Nafplio]], then capital of Greece, and negotiate. As soon as Tzanis arrived, he was arrested and imprisoned. Capodistrias then sent soldiers to Mani and had Petros arrested, imprisoned, and charged with [[high treason]]. His brother Konstantinos, the defender of Nafplio, and Petros' son, [[Georgios Mavromichalis]], were put under house arrest in the capital.<ref name="Paroulakis168">Paroulakis, ''The Greeks: Their Struggle for Independence", 168</ref>

[[Image:Ioannis Kapodistrias (1776-1831)..JPG|thumb|right|200px|Ioannis Kapodistrias (1776-1831); [[oil painting]] by D. Tsokos.]]

On [[September 27]], [[1831]], ([[October 9]] in the [[Gregorian calendar]]), Capodistrias went to attend a church service at the [[Church of St. Spyridon]]. He noticed that Konstantinos and Georgios were waiting at the church doors. As he passed them, he briefly stopped before proceeding into the church. As he was about to step into the church, Konstantinos fired his gun and the bullet hit Capodistrias at the back of the head while at the same time Georgios stabbed him through the heart. Capodistrias collapsed into the arms of his attendants. Capodistrias' bodyguard shot Konstantinos as he was running, and Konstantinos was hit by several more bullets before he died. Kostantinos' body was then dragged by an angry mob, who threw it into the sea. Georgios was captured and executed on the island of [[Bourzi]], off the coast of Nafplio, while his father looked on.<ref name="Paroulakis168">Paroulakis, ''The Greeks: Their Struggle for Independence", 168</ref>

[[Image:Otto of Greece.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[King Otto]], the first king of Greece.]]

In [[1833]], [[Otto of Greece|Otto von Wittelsbach]], a son of [[Ludwig I of Bavaria]] and Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen, became [[King of Greece]] after he was appointed by the [[Great Powers]]. Since he was underage, he had a Council of Regency headed by [[Josef Ludwig von Armansperg]] governing the country for him.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos58">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 58</ref> One of the Council's first acts was to try to subdue the unruly Maniots and pull down their towers; another was to free Petros and Tzanis from their prisons.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos35">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 35</ref> The council sent an army of [[Bavarians]] in order to tame Messa Mani.<ref name="Kassis43">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 43</ref> They made it to Areopolis, but during the night the Maniots surrounded and captured them, forcing them to leave the area.<ref name="Kassis44">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 44</ref>

On [[May 14]], [[1834]], four companies of Bavarian troops, assisted by four cannon, laid siege to the town of [[Petrovouni]]. Ultimately, 800 Maniots from the surrounding towns attacked the Bavarians. The Bavarians were massacred as most of them were either slain by the Maniots or fell into a ravine near the town while escaping. Later that year, an army of 6,000 men with five cannon under the command of General [[Schmaltz]], assisted by five squadrons of royalist Maniots, once again besieged Petrovouni. When news of an army of 1,000 Maniots was approaching, they retreated to Gytheio.<ref name="Kassis44">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 44</ref>

The Council decided that they could not subdue the Maniots by force, so they decided to send a diplomat, [[Max Feder]], with the intention of subduing Mani. He went to different Maniot families and offered them positions if they supported the king. Many of the Achamnomeri (see note α below) and some Megalogenites were convinced by his offers and complied. However, several of the older families and the poorer Achamnomeri rejected the offer, because the former did not want to be dependent on a king and the latter did not want governors with superior rights. In [[Kitta]], this division caused bloodshed when the king's supporters started fighting the other Maniots under the command of [[Giorgaros Skylakakis]].<ref name="Kassis44">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 44</ref> Feder soon arrived with his new allies and blew up Skylakakis and all his allies in his towers. Thus was Mani finally subdued.<ref name="Kassis45">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 45</ref>

===Late 19th century===

During Otto's rule, blood was spilled in Mani because of the [[vendettas]], which have plagued the area for centuries.<ref name="Kassis45">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 45</ref> The vendettas continued until [[1870]], when a Maniot vendetta was halted by the efforts of a regular army with artillery support.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos36">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 36</ref> In [[1841]], [[Crete]] revolted against the Ottomans. The Maniots, described as ''cousins'' of the Cretans, rushed to Crete to support them. The Cretans, together with the Maniots, forced the Turks into a fortress, where they besieged them. A combined Ottoman-English fleet managed to subdue the Cretans and make the Maniots go back to Mani. In [[1866]], a new revolution sparked in Crete, and 2,000 Maniots under the command of [[Petropoulakis]] went to assist their cousins. However, the Cretans were defeated, and the Maniots were again forced to retreat to Mani.<ref name="Kassis45">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 45</ref>

===20th century===

At the start of the [[20th century]], Greece was involved with the [[Greek Struggle for Macedonia|Macedonian Struggle]], military conflicts against the [[VMRO|Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]], and Turkish forces in [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-occupied [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. Many volunteers from Mani took part in the war. The Maniots also took part in the series of wars that followed including the [[Balkan Wars]], [[World War I]], and the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)]]. The participation of troops from Mani in these wars under [[Constantine I of Greece]], created strong [[royalist]] feelings amongst Maniots. That's why most Maniots stayed loyal to Constantine during the Greek [[National Schism]].<ref name="Kassis46">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 46</ref>

During [[World War II]], the Maniots significantly contributed to the [[Hellenic Army]]. During the [[Battle of Greece]], a Maniot named Colonel [[Konstantinos Davakis]] was among the leaders of the armed forces.<ref name="Kassis46">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 46</ref> Davakis, in command of the Pindus Detachment, defeated the Italians at the [[Battle of Pindus]] ([[October 28]] - [[November 13]], [[1940]]), despite the Italians having more advanced weaponry.

Later, the [[Royal Navy]] of the [[United Kingdom]] defeated the [[Regia Marina]] of Italy in the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]] ([[March 27]] - [[March 29]], [[1941]]) on Cape [[Tenaro]]. However, [[Nazi Germany]] attacked Greece in order to support the Italians. The Greeks were forced to retreat, and soon Mani revived its forgotten role as a center for refugees. In April 1941, the British started evacuating their troops from Porto Kagio. By the end of that month, Mani and the rest of Greece were under [[Axis occupation of Greece during World War II|Italian and German occupation]].<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos141">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 141</ref>

During the occupation, Mani became a stonghold of the German-collaborating [[Security Battalions]], because of the anti-communist sentiment of the Maniots. The Germans and Italians left of Greece in [[1944]], but as soon as they left the [[Greek Civil War]] began. The armies of the [[Communist Party of Greece]], [[ELAS]] and [[DSE]], fought against the Hellenic Army and the royalists.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos38">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 38</ref> Mani never recovered from both wars, and soon the young people of Mani left for [[Athens]], the [[United States]], and [[Australia]].<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos39">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 39</ref>

Today, Mani is divided between two prefectures, [[Laconia]] and [[Messenia]]. Mani has around 18,000 inhabitants, with the most important and populous town being [[Gytheio]]. Mani's main source of income is tourism. The most famous of the tourist attractions are the [[Caves of Diro]], which are two caves that have underwater rivers flowing through them.

===Dances===

Two dances come from Mani: Palio Maniatiko (Greek: Old Maniot) and the Modern Maniatiko. The Palio Maniatiko is only found in Mani and is described as an ancient dance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mani.org.au/dancegroup/dgDanceTypes.asp |title=Types of Dances

===Piracy===

Part of Maniot culture entailed [[piracy]]. The Maniots were famous and fearsome pirates whose ships dominated the Maniot coastline. The Maniots became pirates because Mani was not a very fertile land and the Maniots did not have many natural resources. The Maniots considered piracy a legitimate response to the fact that their land was poor, and it became their main source of income.<ref name="Barrow16">Barrow, ''The Mani", 16</ref> The pirate raids were not stopped by the local priests of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], who in fact blessed the ships before they left and sometimes accompanied them on raids. Most of the Maniot pirates came from Messa Mani.<ref name="Barrow17>Barrow, ''The Mani", 17</ref> The main victims of Maniot pirates were the Ottomans, but the Maniots also targeted ships of powerful European countries.<ref name="Kassis38">Kassis, ''Mani's History", 38</ref>

===Superstition===

The Maniots are a very superstitious people.<ref name="Barrow18>Barrow, ''The Mani", 18</ref> Maniots mainly believe in [[Witchcraft|witches]], [[demon]]s, [[vampire]]s, and [[ghost]]s.<ref name="Barrow18>Barrow, ''The Mani", 18</ref> When [[Henry Herbert, 3rd Earl of Carnarvon]], was touring Mani in 1839, he found a fresh egg by the side of the road and offered it to a Maniot soldier who escorted him, who declined the offer claiming that if a [[hag]] had enchanted it he would have to marry her.<ref name="Barrow18>Barrow, ''The Mani", 18</ref> The Maniots thought that certain areas were haunted by demons.<ref name="Barrow18>Barrow, ''The Mani", 18</ref>

===Vendettas===

Another important aspect of Maniot culture were the [[vendetta]]s which frequently plagued Mani. Usually, the decision to start a vendetta was made at a family gathering. The main aim of a vendetta was usually to wipe out the other family.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mani.org.gr/en/history/venteta.htm |title=Vendetta

}}</ref>

Some vendettas went on for months, sometimes years. In vendettas, the families could have a truce or ''treva'', if one family needed to attend a religious ceremony or when it was time to harvest the crops.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mani.org.gr/en/history/venteta.htm |title=Vendetta

|author=Venizeleas
}}</ref> As soon as the treva ended, the killing could resume. Vendettas usually ended when one family was exterminated or when the defeated family left the town. Sometimes families came to terms, and vendettas stopped when the Turks invaded.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mani.org.gr/en/history/venteta.htm |title=Vendetta

=Ethnology=

The inhabitants of Mani consider themselves direct descendants of the ancient Spartans. After the Romans took over Laconia, many of the citizens who were loyal to the laws of [[Lycurgus (Sparta)|Lycurgus]] decided to flee to the mountains of Mani rather than be in Achean or, later, Roman service.<ref name="Hall, Hellander, Simcock and Willet263">,Hall, Hellander, Simcock and Willet ''Lonely Planet: Greece", 263</ref> Even though it seems highly unlikely, Kassis claims that Maniots rarely mated with non-Maniots until the 20th century.<ref name="Kassis20">,Kassis ''Mani's History", 20</ref>

Mani became a refuge during the [[4th century]] when the [[barbarian invasions]] started in Europe. When the Avars and Slavs invaded the Peloponnese, many Greek refugees fled to Mani since the invaders could not infiltrate the mountainous terrain. According to Constantine Porphyrogenitus, the Maniots were not conquered by the Slavs, ''Be it known that the inhabitants of Castle Maina are not from the race of aforesaid Slavs but from the older Romaioi, who up to the present time are termed Hellenes.''<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos22">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 22</ref>

=Notes=
[[Image:Vathia Mani Greece.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Vathia, a typical Maniot village famous for its towers.]]

{{cnote|α|In the second Byzantine occupation of Mani, there were four social castes, the Nikliani, the Megalogenites, the Achamnomeri and the Fameyi. The Nikliani were the inhabitants of the town of Nikli before it was sacked by the Byzantine emperor, [[Andronicus II Palaeologus]]. Kyriakos Kassis claims that the Nikliani were a family<ref name="Kassis24">Kassis, "Mani's History", 24</ref> while Patrick Leigh Fermor claims they were the inhabitants of Nykli.<ref name="Fermor86">Fermor, ''Mani: Travels into the Southern Peloponnese", 86</ref> The Nikliani were wealthy, upper class people who started the building of castles in Mani.<ref name="Kassis24">Kassis, "Mani's History", 24</ref> 

The Megalogenites (Greek: big births), were refugees from other parts of Greece who were from wealthy and renown families like the Commenoi, Palaeologoi, Medici and others. They mostly ignored the Niklianis' laws or tried to live in harmony with them. The Megalogenites also started building towers like the ones built by the Nikliani.<ref name="Kassis24">Kassis, "Mani's History", 24</ref>

The Achamnormeri were the third Maniot class and was the middle class. It did not have as many rights as the first two classes. They had the right to build only one-story towers and they were not allowed to build towers out of limestone or marble. They owned most of the fields and had a right to a portion of common property like quail, salt, and fish. They also had the freedom of movement and means of production. If during the night, they managed to raise a tower larger than one of their neighbors, they were considered more powerful.<ref name="Kassis25">Kassis, "Mani's History", 25</ref>

The last caste were the Fameyi who were serfs. They had no property and they were sometimes confused with the Achamnormeri by modern historians. They could be subject to emancipation and become Achamnormeri.<ref name="Kassis25">Kassis, "Mani's History", 25</ref>
}}

{{cnote|β|In 1453, Mani's population grew drastically as a plethora of refugees arrived from other parts of Greece, after the [[Fall of Constantinople]].<ref name="Kassis38">Kassis, "Mani's History", 38</ref> Around that time, towns like Skoutari were founded by people who had escaped from Constaninople.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos54">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 54</ref> Kassis tells us that the population of Mani at that time was between 40,000 and 80,000.<ref name="Kassis38">Kassis, "Mani's History", 38</ref>

Count Chateau-Reneau says that at the beginning of the 17th century, there were 700 cities and many villages in Mani which was thought to be an exaggerated number. In 1700, 14,773 people were recorded in the census despite the constant migrations in Mani. In 1805, Colonel William Leake records that there were 30,000 people living in Mani. Twelve years later, K. Koumas writes in his geography that Mani had 100,000 inhabitants which was deemed a wildly exaggerated number. In 1820, Anagnostras composition for the [[Philiki Eteria]] says that Mani had 8,000 fighting men. Kassis comes to the conclusion that Mani had around 45,000 inhabitants in 1820.<ref name="Kassis38">Kassis, "Mani's History", 38</ref>
}}

{{cnote|γ|As a result of the many revolts against the Ottoman Empire, the Maniots welcomed new Greek refugees from various areas including [[Asia Minor]], and especially Crete when the Turks acquired the island from the Venetians in [[1669]]. The Cretan refugees settled in Mani and created villages with Cretan names that enriched the Maniot dialect with Cretan words and idioms.<ref name="Fermor150">Fermor, ''Mani: Travels into the Southern Peloponnese", 150</ref>

The mass migration of refugees caused new problems in Mani. The limited area of good arable land led to many local wars between families, clans, and different villages. The era of [[vendettas]] began in Mani and it seemed that only a new Ottoman invasion could save the country from a civil war. Many Maniot people began to serve as mercenaries in the army of the [[Doge of Venice]] while some others became pirates to fulfill their patriotic duties. In fact, the Ottoman fleet near [[Chania]], Crete was destroyed by Maniot pirates.<ref name="Kassis32">Kassis, "Mani's History", 32</ref>}}

{{cnote|δ|Between 1600 and 1700, there was a mass exodus of Maniots leaving Mani for European countries. In 1570, some Maniots immigrated to [[Volterra]].<ref name="Kassis27">Kassis, "Mani's History", 27</ref> Around 700 members of the Stephanopoulos clan migrated to [[Corcisa]], as well as the Iatrini, (whose Latinized name happened to be Medici) who went to live in [[Tuscany]] after gaining [[Ferdinand Medici]]'s permission.<ref name="Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos27">Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, ''Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece", 27</ref> There are still towers in Tuscany that look similar to the ones in Mani. The [[Duke of Genoa]] wanted some Maniots to colonize the western Italian coast and protect it from pirates. There are mentions of Maniots in Naples and T. Asanis Palaeologus building a church there. There are also tombs of Palaeologi in [[Cornwell]], [[England]], as well as one in [[Westminister]] of a Palaeologus who fought with [[Oliver Cromwell]]. [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], the [[King of Spain]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]], had distinguished an army corp name the ''Mainoti''.<ref name="Kassis28">Kassis, "Mani's History", 28</ref>
