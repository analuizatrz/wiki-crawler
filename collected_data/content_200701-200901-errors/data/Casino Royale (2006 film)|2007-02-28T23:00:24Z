'''''Casino Royale''''' is the 21st [[film]] in the [[James Bond]] series and the first to star [[Daniel Craig]] as [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent [[James Bond (character)|James Bond]]. Based on the 1953 novel ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'' by [[Ian Fleming]], it was adapted by [[Neal Purvis]], [[Robert Wade (screenwriter)|Robert Wade]], and [[Academy Award]]-winning screenwriter [[Paul Haggis]] and directed by [[Martin Campbell]], director of the 1995 Bond film ''[[GoldenEye]]''. It is produced by [[EON Productions]] for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and [[Columbia Pictures]], marking the first official Bond film to be co-produced by the latter studio, which had produced and originally distributed the 1967 [[Canon (fiction)|non-canonical]] film version [[Casino Royale (1967 film)|of the same name]]; this is the result of the 2005 [[Sony Pictures Entertainment|Sony]]/[[Comcast Corporation|Comcast]] consortium's acquisition of MGM, [[parent company]] of Bond film series rights co-owner [[United Artists]]. The film, and [[Daniel Craig]]'s performance in particular, quickly earned critical acclaim. It is the highest grossing James Bond film to date.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.variety.com/article/VR1360000986.html?categoryid=13&cs=1|title= "Casino" sets worldwide Bond record |accessdate=2006-12-25}}</ref> It is also the [[List of highest-grossing films|34th highest-grossing film of all-time]] and the 6th highest grossing film of all-time in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web | title = All Time | publisher = The Sky is Falling | url =  http://www.sky-is-falling.co.uk/archives-alltime.html | accessdate=2007-02-18}}</ref>

The film is a [[reboot (continuity)|reboot]] of the Bond franchise.  The events in the film are not designed to precede ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' or any other Bond films, as in a [[prequel]]; instead, they establish a new [[Alternate history (fiction)|timeline]] and narrative framework, though it is still considered the 21st entry in the film series by EON Productions.  This film marks the third screen adaptation of Ian Fleming's first Bond novel, which was previously produced as a [[Casino Royale (novel)#The 1954 television episode|1954 television episode]] and a [[Casino Royale (1967 film)|1967 film spoof]]. However, the 2006 release is the only official EON Productions adaptation of Fleming's novel.

''Casino Royale'' is the first Bond film to take its title from an Ian Fleming novel or short story since 1987's ''[[The Living Daylights]]''. It is also the first Bond film since ''The Living Daylights'' not to be adapted as a novelisation. Instead a film [[tie-in]] edition of Fleming's original novel was published in the UK on [[October 31]] [[2006]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Stamos | first = Athena | title = Casino Royale Movie Tie-in Edition | publisher = CommanderBond.net |date=[[2006-04-02]] | url = http://commanderbond.net/Public/Stories/3165-1.shtml | accessdate = 2006-11-21}}</ref> 

==Plot==
{{spoiler}}
At the opening of the film, James Bond is sent on a mission in [[Prague]] to kill an [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] section chief, [[List of James Bond henchmen in Casino Royale#Dryden|Dryden]], who has sold British secrets. Bond must make two kills to qualify for Double-0 status, granting him a licence to kill: first, Dryden's associate, [[List of James Bond henchmen in Casino Royale#Fisher|Fisher]], and then the section chief himself. The killing of the associate in the men's room leads to the opening credits. Unlike in other Bond films, the opening (including the [[MGM]] and [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]] logos) is filmed in [[black and white]], and the [[James Bond gun barrel sequence|gunbarrel sequence]] is modified to form part of the opening titles.

Bond then travels to [[Madagascar]] in pursuit of an international bomb-maker. After a [[free running]] chase to the Nambutu embassy, Bond chooses to kill the bomb-maker and blow up part of the embassy to escape. Bond's actions are recorded on [[closed-circuit television]] and exposed in the world press, which enrages [[M (James Bond)|M]], his boss at MI6. Bond's target had been working for [[Le Chiffre]], an unscrupulous banker who manages money for terrorist organizations.  Le Chiffre uses his connections to stage attacks against certain companies in order to [[short selling|short sell]] their stocks with his clients' funds. Bond foils Le Chiffre's plans to blow up a prototype airliner at [[Miami International Airport]], which causes huge losses for Le Chiffre. To recoup this loss, Le Chiffre sets up a high-stakes [[Texas hold 'em]] [[poker]] tournament at Casino Royale in [[Montenegro]]. MI6 enters Bond in the tournament to bankrupt Le Chiffre. If Bond succeeds, it will deny Le Chiffre the money he needs and force him to aid the British government in exchange for protection from his creditors. Bond meets up with [[List of James Bond allies in Casino Royale#Ren.C3.A9 Mathis|Mathis]], his contact in Montenegro, and [[Vesper Lynd]], a [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] agent, who is assigned to look after Bond's handling of the [[United States dollar|$]]10 million buy-in. 

During the game, Bond misreads Le Chiffre as bluffing and loses his initial stake. Vesper refuses to give him the funds to [[buying in|rebuy]], but the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s [[Felix Leiter]] offers to stake Bond in exchange for Le Chiffre. Bond wins the tournament, but before the CIA can take Le Chiffre into custody, he kidnaps Vesper and lures Bond into a near-fatal car chase, which results in his capture as well. Le Chiffre tortures Bond by repeatedly striking his testicles with a knotted rope to make him reveal the account password to the game's winnings. When it becomes clear that Bond will not give in, Le Chiffre advances to [[castration|castrate]] him. Before he can, [[Mr. White (James Bond)|Mr. White]] arrives and kills Le Chiffre and his associates while leaving Bond and Vesper alive. Bond awakens in a hospital on [[Lake Como]] and has Mathis, whom Le Chiffre suggested was a [[double agent]], arrested.  Mathis's affiliation is left ambiguous at the conclusion of the film.

Bond admits his love for Vesper and vows to quit the service before it strips him of his humanity. When she agrees, Bond e-mails his resignation to M, and the two go on a romantic holiday in [[Venice]]. Bond soon learns that the funds were never deposited in the Treasury's account and finds Vesper taking the money to a mysterious organization only vaguely alluded to throughout the film. Bond pursues them into a building under renovation. Upon locating several of this group's men hiding there, he deliberately shoots and ruptures the flotation devices supporting the structure and the foundation collapses slowly into the [[Grand Canal of Venice|Grand Canal]]. Vesper apologizes to Bond and commits suicide by locking herself in an elevator that sinks underwater. Bond dives underwater in an attempt to rescue Vesper and though he manages to break into the elevator and bring Vesper to the surface, it is too late. Mr. White stands on an opposite balcony to survey the scene and then walks away with the money. Bond, feeling betrayed ("The bitch is dead," he says, a direct quote from the original novel), learns that MI6 believed Vesper negotiated the handover of money in order to save Bond's life from Le Chiffre and the organisation. Bond, who has Vesper's mobile phone, discovers that she left Mr. White's name and number for Bond to find.

Mr. White, arriving at a palatial estate, receives a phone call. A voice on the line says, "Mr. White? We need to talk." As White asks "Who is this?", he is shot in the leg. As he crawls towards the villa, Bond appears, revealing himself as the shooter, with a silenced submachine gun and responds to Mr. White's question with the iconic [[catch phrase]] "The name's Bond. James Bond."

Two major exclusions from the film are the characters of [[Q (James Bond)|Q]] and [[Miss Moneypenny]]. They were not included in the screenplay, which makes this only the second Bond film without Q since his initial appearance in From Russia With Love (1973's ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'' being the first) and the first without Moneypenny. In October 2005, producer Michael G. Wilson stated that the omission of the characters was due to the characters not appearing in the novel; however, Moneypenny was in the novel and had one line of dialogue, although [[Q (James Bond)|Major Boothroyd]], which the films transformed into the character Q, did not appear until several books later.<ref>{{cite news| last = Hastings | first = Chris | coauthors = Nina Goswami and David Fickling | title = Ah, Miss Moneypenny.

===Cameos===
The movie features [[cameo appearance|cameo roles]] by British entrepreneur [[Richard Branson]] (seen being [[Frisking|frisked]] at an airport), American hotel tycoon Jerry Inzerillo, Brazilian supermodel [[Alessandra Ambrosio]] (seen when Bond first approaches the Ocean Club), and [[Sens Unik]] rapper [[Carlos Leal]]. Key members of the production also feature in cameo roles â producer [[Michael G. Wilson]] appears as the corrupt Montenegrin police chief, continuing his long-standing tradition of Bond film cameos dating from ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'', while director of cinematography Phil Meheux features briefly as a treasury bureaucrat and the film's director [[Martin Campbell]] makes a fleeting cameo as the face of the murdered petrol tanker driver at Miami Airport. In addition, [[Tsai Chin (actress)|Tsai Chin]], who played [[List of James Bond allies in You Only Live Twice#Ling|Ling]] in the opening sequence of ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'', and [[Diane Hartford]], who had a small part in [[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]] (as the girl Bond dances with while escaping from [[Fiona Volpe]]) appear respectively as Madame Wu (the Chinese Woman playing cards with Le Chiffre aboard his yacht) and one of the players in the Bahamas poker game. Sixties model [[Veruschka|"Veruschka" von Lehndorff]] also appears in the background at the casino.<ref>{{cite web | title = Trivia for Casino Royale (2006) | url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0381061/trivia | accessdate = 2006-12-08 }}</ref>

==Production==
===Development===
{{Expand|date=January 2007}}
The film is said to take James Bond "back to his roots" in a film that would be similar to ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'', where the focus was on character and plot rather than high-tech gadgets and visual effects, two issues that were most criticised in ''[[Die Another Day]]''.{{Fact|date=January 2007}} Additionally, EON admitted that they relied too heavily on [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] effects and accomplished the stunts in ''Casino Royale'' "the old fashioned way."<ref>{{cite news| last = Alberge| first = Dayla| title = Fake stunts banished as new Bond keeps it real| publisher = [[The Times Online]] |date=[[2006-03-14]] | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2084375,00.html| accessdate = 2006-11-21}}</ref> The move towards more action, bigger special effects and CGI in recent Bond films was in part due to a need to compete at the time with big-budget action films that dominated the 1990s box office.{{Fact|date=January 2007}} However, the success of less grandiose action films such as ''[[The Bourne Supremacy (film)|The Bourne Supremacy]]'' in the last few years has suggested the time may be right for the Bond series to scale back as it did during the Roger Moore era with ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]'', which followed special effects extravaganzas like ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]''.{{Fact|date=January 2007}}

===Casting===

Pierce Brosnan had a three film contract with an option of the fourth that expired with Die Another Day; and in the Die Another Day DVD Pierce stated: "I had a blast-I wanted to go out with a high note (Die Another Day), but I think it's time for both me and the producers to move on, I'm done with Bond". In 2003, Pierce Brosnan said, "that's it, I'm done with Bond".<ref>{{cite news | title=Pierce Brosnan leaves Bond | publisher = Entertainment Weekly | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,673018,00.html | date = [[2003-05-07]] | accessdate=2003-08-10}}</ref>

Throughout 2004 and 2005, an endless stream of potential new "Bonds", both unknowns and established Hollywood actors, were announced by some media. Michael G. Wilson claimed there was a list of over 200 names.{{Fact|date=January 2007}} Of note, [[Eric Bana]], [[Clive Owen]], [[Hugh Jackman]], and Daniel Craig were at one point confirmed to have been signed or to have been offered the role by various news outlets.{{Fact|date=January 2007}} Rumours surrounding Owen intensified in early 2005 after he was awarded a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture|Golden Globe]] and a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] and nominated for a [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for his [[2004 in film|2004]] film, ''[[Closer (movie)|Closer]]''. 

In May 2005, Daniel Craig stated that MGM had assured him that he had the job, likewise [[Matthew Vaughn]] told reporters that MGM offered him the opportunity to direct, but for both EON Productions had not approached them.<ref>{{cite web | title=Craig, Vaughn on Bond | url=http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/609/609721p1.html |date=[[2005-05-03]] | accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref> Later, Craig stated that the producers offered him the role, but he turned the role down when they didn't have a script for him to read first.<ref>{{cite web | title=Bond is Dead! (Long Live Bond!) | url=http://www.esquire.com/features/articles/2006/060807_mfe_September_06_Bond.html |date=September 2006 | accessdate= 2006-08-10}}</ref> By August 2005, the 37-year-old Daniel Craig was still considered by many to be in the running. On [[October 14]] [[2005]], EON Productions and Sony Pictures Entertainment confirmed to the public that Daniel Craig would be the new James Bond.

After Daniel Craig was announced as James Bond, attention turned to the casting of the lead [[Bond girl]], [[Vesper Lynd]]. [[Casting (performing arts)|Casting director]] [[Debbie McWilliams]] has acknowledged that [[Angelina Jolie]] and [[Charlize Theron]] were "strongly considered" for the role.<ref>{{cite web| title = Casino Royale Bond girl candidates | publisher = [[MI6.co.uk]] |date= [[2006-07-07]]| url = http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/articles/bond_21_girl_casting_rumours.php3?t=bond21&s=bond21| accessdate =2006-11-21}}</ref> McWilliams also stated that [[CÃ©cile de France]] auditioned for the role, but her [[English English|English accent]] "wasn't up to scratch." [[Audrey Tautou]] was also considered, but ultimately not chosen because of her role in ''[[The Da Vinci Code (film)|The Da Vinci Code]]'' that was released in May 2006.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.superherohype.com/news/jamesbondnews.php?id=4470 | title= The New Bond Girls! | publisher = superherohype.com |date= [[2006-07-07]] | accessdate=2006-03-04}}</ref> [[Eva Green]] was finally announced as having been cast on [[February 16]] [[2006]].

===Filming===
{{see also|James Bond locations}}
[[Image:Daniel Craig on Venice yacht crop w Wilson.jpg|thumb|200px|Craig and Michael G. Wilson in Venice during filming.]]
[[Principal photography]] for ''Casino Royale'' commenced on [[January 30]], [[2006]], and concluded on [[July 21]], [[2006]]. The film was primarily shot at [[Barrandov Studios]] in [[Prague]], with additional location shooting in the [[Czech Republic]], the [[Bahamas]], [[Italy]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Production returned to its traditional home of [[Pinewood Studios]] to complete the shooting schedule.

Initially, Michael G. Wilson confirmed that ''Casino Royale'' would be filmed and/or take place in Prague and South Africa. However, following problems for EON Productions in securing film locations in South Africa,<ref>{{cite news | last = Cox| first = John| title = Eon facing South African detour| publisher = CommanderBond.net|date= [[2005-08-08]]| url = http://commanderbond.net/?action=Story&SID=2877 | accessdate = 2006-11-21}}</ref> the producers had to reconsider their options. On [[September 13]], [[2005]], CommanderBond.net reported that Martin Campbell (director) and Phil Meheux (director of photography) were scouting [[Atlantis Paradise Island|Paradise Island]] in the [[The Bahamas|Bahamas]] as a possible location for the film.<ref> {{cite news | last = Cox| first = John| title = Bond bound for Bahamas|date=[[2005-09-13]] | publisher = CommanderBond.net | url = http://commanderbond.net/?action=Story&SID=2922| accessdate =2006-11-21}}</ref> On [[October 6]], [[2005]], Martin Campbell confirmed that ''Casino Royale'' would film in the Bahamas and "maybe Italy." In addition to the extensive location filming, studio work was done at the [[Barrandov Studios]] in Prague and at [[Pinewood Studios]] in England, where the film used several stages as well as the paddock tank and the historic [[Albert R. Broccoli]] [[Albert R. Broccoli's 007 Stage|007 Stage]]. Further shooting in the UK was scheduled for [[Dunsfold]] Aerodrome in [[Surrey]], the cricket pavilion at [[Eton College]] (although that particular scene was cut from the completed movie) and the Millbrook Vehicle Proving Ground in [[Bedfordshire]].

After principal photography had commenced in Prague on [[January 30]] [[2006]], the production moved to the Bahamas. Several locations around [[New Providence]] were used for filming during February and March, largely on Paradise Island and in the southern Coral Harbour area, with an abandoned Royal Bahamian Air Force base being a particularly important location for the production. Footage set in Uganda was filmed at Black Park, Country Park in Buckinghamshire concluding on [[July 4]] [[2006]]. Additional scenes took place at Albany House â an estate recently acquired by golfers [[Ernie Els]] and [[Tiger Woods]].<ref>{{cite news | title = James Bond takes over Ernie and Tiger's pad | publisher = Ernie Els Official Website |date= [[2006-06-12]] | url = http://www.ernieels.com/search.aspx?i_MediaEntryID=506 | accessdate = 2006-11-21}}</ref>

The crew returned to the Czech Republic in April, and continued there, filming in Prague, [[PlanÃ¡ (Tachov District)|PlanÃ¡]] and [[Loket]], before completing in the town of [[Karlovy Vary]] in May. A disused [[destination spa|spa]], formerly known as the Kaiserbad, in Karlovy Vary was used as the exterior of the Casino Royale, with the [[Grandhotel Pupp]] serving as the "Hotel Splendide" where Bond stays during his time in Montenegro.<ref>{{cite news | title = On set report from Casino Royale getaway chase sequence | publisher = [[MI6.co.uk]] |date= [[2006-05-23]]| url = http://www.mi6.co.uk/news/index.php?itemid=3701&catid=2 | accessdate =2006-11-21}}</ref>

The main Italian location alluded to by Campbell is [[Venice]], where the majority of the film's ending is set. Other scenes in the latter half of the film were filmed in late May and early June at the [[Villa del Balbianello]] on the shores of [[Lake Como]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Roth | first = Tim | title = Italian location revealed | publisher = CommanderBond.net |date= [[2006-02-28]] | url = http://commanderbond.net/Public/Stories/3119-1.shtml | accessdate =2006-11-21}}</ref> Further exterior shooting for the movie took place at properties such as the Villa la Gaeta, near the lakeside town of [[Menaggio]].

On [[July 30]], [[2006]], a fire broke out at the [[007 Stage|Albert R. Broccoli 007 Stage]] at Pinewood. The damage was significant, but had no effect on the release of ''Casino Royale'' as the sets were in the process of being taken down.<ref>{{cite news | title = Fire wrecks James Bond film stage| publisher = [[BBC News]]|date= [[2006-07-30]]| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/5228794.stm| accessdate =2006-11-21 }}</ref> The incident occurred one week after filming of ''Casino Royale'' had been completed.

==Soundtrack==
{{Main|Casino Royale (2006 soundtrack)}}
The soundtrack to the 2006 film ''Casino Royale'' was released by [[Sony Classical]] on [[November 14]], [[2006]]. The music was composed by [[David Arnold]] and is Arnold's fourth soundtrack for the film series. Frequent collaborator [[Nicholas Dodd]] orchestrated and conducted the score. The title song ''[[You Know My Name]]'' is performed by [[Chris Cornell]], though it is not present on the soundtrack but released as a separate single. 
 
The soundtrack plays on themes built from the title song. Consistent with the reboot of the James Bond storyline, only at the end, when Bond resumes his usual role, is the classic James Bond theme used.

The music featured in the official trailer for the movie is attributed to "Pfeifer Broz". The music features a choir chanting a section of the traditional Bond theme. The choir does not appear in the main soundtrack.

==Release and response==

[[Michael Medved]] gave ''Casino Royale'' three stars (out of four) calling it "...intriguing, audacious and very original...".

It was reported that the film was released without change, but it later emerged, the Chinese version was edited before release, having a line about the Cold War re-dubbed and a new dialogue added during the poker scene explaining the process of [[Texas Holdem|Texas Hold'em]], as the game is less well known in China.

===Black Market===
The box office coup was immediately followed by pirate copies of the film, which appeared for sale in London two days after the premiere. âThe rapid appearance of this film on the streets shows the sophistication and organisation behind film piracy in the UK,â said Kieron Sharp, from the Federation Against Copyright Theft.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6157066.stm
