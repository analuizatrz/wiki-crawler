'''William Maldon "Bill" Woodfull''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] ([[22 August]] [[1897]], [[Maldon, Victoria]], [[Australia]] - [[11 August]] [[1965]], [[Tweed Heads]], [[New South Wales]]) was an Australian [[cricket]]er. He captained both [[Victorian Bushrangers|Victoria]] and [[Australian cricket team|Australia]], and was best known for his dignified and moral conduct during the tumultuous [[Bodyline]] series in 1932-33 which almost saw the end of Anglo-Australian cricketing ties. Trained as a schoolteacher, Woodfull was known for his benevolent attitude towards his players, and his patience and defensive technique as an opening batsman. After making his first-class debut in 1921, Woodfull rose to national selection in 1926. Touring England, he was named as one of the [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year]]. He reluctantly became captain in 1930 when [[Jack Ryder]] was dropped, and regained the Ashes on the English tour of the same year. After ceding them to England in the Bodyline tour, Woodfull bade farewell to international cricket on the 1934 English tour when he became the only captain to regain the Ashes twice. 

== Style ==

Woodfull batted in a manner which had little aesthetic pleasure or grace, with [[Wisden]] describing stating that “at first sight, he gave the impression of being clumsy”.<ref name="wisden"/> Affected by a bout of rheumatoid fever in childhood, he had stiff-jointed style, and played with little noticeable backlift. This gave the impression of a laboured playing style. Despite this, he scored consistently through good placement and powerful [[List of cricket terms#D|drives]] generated by his strong forearms.<ref name="wisden">{{cite web| title= Wisden 19279 - Bill Woodfull |url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/154706.html| year= [[1962]] |accessdate=2007-05-24| publisher=-[[Wisden]]}}</ref> He was known for playing with a straight bat and a close watch on the ball, which were the core features of a strong defensive ability, which yielded names such as “the unbowlable” (a reference to the fact that he was rarely [[bowled]] as a result of missing the ball) and “wormkiller”. He was also known for his reliability in crisis match situations, leading to epithets such as “The Rock” and “Old Steadfast”. Woodfull formed an opening partnership with [[Bill Ponsford]] at state and international level which yielded 18 century opening stands. Dubbed “Mutt and Jeff” by team-mates after a famous [[vaudeville]] act, they were regarded as one of the finest opening partnerships in Test history. As a captain, Woodfull was known for his courage and high moral principles in the face of the Bodyline series. Fellow player [[Stan McCabe]] described him as "the greatest man I ever met."<ref name="az">{{cite book | last = Cashman, Franks, Maxwell, Sainsbury, Stoddart, Weaver, Webster | year = 1997 | title = The A-Z of Australian cricketers|pages =322-323}}</ref><ref name="pollard">{{cite book | last = Pollard |first= Jack | year = 1969 | title = Cricket the Australian Way| pages=182}}</ref>

== Early years ==
Born in the central Victorian town of [[Maldon]], Woodfull's family moved to [[Melbourne]] when his father Thomas, a [[Methodist]] preacher, was given a transfer to [[Collingwood, Victoria|Collingwood]], and inner city suburb. Woodfull's father installed a net in the backyard and taught him the emphasis on defensive technique and patience which were to become his hallmark.<ref name="pyoung">Perry, p.146-147</ref> Woodfull attended [[Melbourne High School (Victoria)|Melbourne High School]] and his early career was unremarkable. He made his district cricket debut in 1916 for [[Essendon, Victoria|Essendon]], at the age of 19, but did not distinguish himself. He played no further cricket at the level before he gained his qualification as a schoolteacher in 1919. He was posted to Maryborough High School, and it was in the rural cricket competition that he began to gain attention. In 1920 and 1921, he accumulated 1335 runs at average of 225.83 in the local competition. When the [[England cricket team]] toured Australia in 1920-21, Woodfull played for a [[Ballarat]] XV, and scored a 50 and 1. A teaching transfer in 1921 saw him return to Melbourne, where the Victorian selectors trialled him in Second XI fixtures. In two matches against [[Southern Redbacks|South Australia]] and [[New South Wales Blues|New South Wales]], he registered unbeaten scores of 186 and 227 respectively. In early 1922, he made his Sheffield Shield debut against South Australia at the [[Adelaide Oval]], and in his second match against [[Western Warriors|Western Australia]], registered his maiden first-class century with 153.<ref name="az"/><ref name="wisden"/> During this time, he also studied for an arts degree at night in addition to his post at Williamstown High School.<ref name="pyoung"/> Between 1922 and 1926, he accumulated over 3000 runs at an average of 67. He solidified his position in the Victorian Sheffield Shield team in the 1922-23 season, when he averaged 85, including a 117 against New South Wales. He averaged 74 in 1924-25, when his best effort was 97 and 236 in a match against South Australia. In a match against New South Wales in the same season, he compiled 81 and 120 not out as Victoria managed to win after their opponents had accumulated 614 in the first innings. At this stage in his career, he was primarily a middle order batsman, opening only occasionally.<ref name="az"/><ref name="wisden"/>

== Test debut ==
[[Image:Woodfull stance.jpg|left|200px|Woodfull's batting stance|thumb]]
As a result of consistent performances for Victoria, Woodfull was selected for [[Herbie Collins]]’ Australian Test team for the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1926|1926 Ashes tour]]. He headed the batting averages in the first class matches and was third in the Tests. In his first two innings on tour, he struck a 201 against [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]] at [[Leyton]] and a 118 at [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] at [[The Oval]]. They were the first of eight centuries during the tour, in which he compiled 1809 runs at 58.35. He made his debut in the first Test at [[Trent Bridge]], but did not bat and failed to make an impression in the second est at [[Lord's Cricket Ground|Lord's]]. He established himself as a Test opener in the Third Test at [[Headingley]]. After opening partner [[Warren Bardsley]] was dismissed without scoring, Woodfull put on a second wicket partnership of 235 with [[Charles Macartney]] to register his maiden Test century of 141. He followed this in the Fourth Test at [[Old Trafford (cricket ground)|Old Trafford]] with 117, the highest score of the innings.<ref name="az"/><ref name="wisden"/><ref name="cricinfo"> {{cite web|title= Players and Officials:Bill Woodfull |url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/8246.html| first=Gideon |last=Haigh| authorlink=Gideon Haigh| accessdate=2007-05-24|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}</ref> His 206 runs at 51 in the Tests placed him third behind Bardsley and Macartney.<ref>Perry, p.147</ref>

Upon his return to Australia, he established his partnership with Ponsford, and in the 1926-27 Shield season, they put on a 375 run opening stand which laid the foundation for the world record first class score of 1107 against New South Wales. In 1927-28 Woodfull recorded his career best score of 284, during a brief tour to [[New Zealand]] as part of an Australian XI.<ref name="az"/>

In the 1928-29 home Ashes series, Woodfull defiantly carried his bat to make an unbeaten 30 as Australia were skittled for 66 on a sticky wicket in [[Brisbane]] in the first Test. He hit three centuries in the series, with 491 runs at 54.56 despite which Australia lost the Ashes 4-1. He aslso managed 275 not out for Victoria during a tour match against the Englishmen, his highest score for his state. His 1929-30 Australian season was cut short when he suffered a broken hand after being hit by a short ball from [[Hugh Thurlow]].<ref name="az"/><ref name="cricinfo"/><ref name="p28-30"/>

== Captaincy ==
[[Image:Bill Woodfull graph.png|right|thumb|350px|Woodfull's Test career batting performance.]]
After the heavy defeat in the previous Ashes series, captain and fellow Victorian [[Jack Ryder]] was omitted altogether from the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1930|1930 Ashes tour]], and Woodfull appointed captain. At first, Woodfull was reluctant to accept the job, feeling that it rightfully belonged to Ryder. When he was informed that Ryder was not even touring, he only agreed after a ballot was organised. After winning, Woodfull led the youngest fifteen man squad to ever tour England, with eleven never having played on English soil. Commentators expected Australia to be easily defeated, being described as "the weakest squad ever to come to these shores."<ref name="p28-30"/> The tour started with a match against [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]], with Woodfull scoring a century and previously obscure young batsman by the name of [[Don Bradman]] making 236* in 275 minutes. After a poor First Test at [[Trent Bridge]], Woodfull set the tone with an opening stand of 162 with fellow Victorian Ponsford in the Second Test at Lord's, before a 231 run stand with Bradman (254) saw Woodfull reach 155. He was unbeaten on 26 in the second innings as Australia completed a seven wicket triumph. He contributed 50 to a stand of 192 with Bradman at Headingley (the match in which Bradman scored 309 in a day), but rain helped England to a draw. The Fourth Test was rained out, but Australia won the last to regain the Ashes. Woodfull had contributed 345 runs at 57.5, second only to Bradman.<ref name="p28-30"/> In all first class matches he compiled 1435 runs at 57.36 including six centuries as Australia recovered the Ashes. Woodfull and his fellow Victorian Ponsford played a significant part by making three century opening stands – 162 at Lord’s, 159 at The Oval and 106 at Old Trafford to help Australia take the initiative.<ref name="az"/><ref name="cricinfo"/>

This was followed by home series against the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] in 1930-31, the first tour of Australia by the Caribbean side. Ponsford unselfishly broke up his opening combination with Ponsford by dropping down to No. 6 to accommodate young batsman [[Archie Jackson]]. Woodfull was uncomfortable batting out of position, but when restored after Jackson's illness became too much, struck 83. He ended with a modest 204 runs at 34 as Australia won 4-1.<ref name="p28-30"/> The following season saw a tour to Australia by the [[South African cricket team|South Africans]]. Woodfull opened for the entire series, and returned his best ever series figures of 421 at 70.17, second only to Bradman. In Melbourne in 1931-32 against he South Africans, he compiled his Test best of 161.<ref name="az"/><ref name="cricinfo"/><ref name="p28-30"/>

=== Bodyline ===
{{main|Bodyline}}
In 1932-33, the English team led by Douglas Jardine won the Ashes in a very acrimonious series. Their "[[Bodyline]]" tactics, which involved bowling at the bodies of the Australian batsmen and employing a close leg-side cordon to catch balls fended away from the upper body, caused great controversy and ill-feeling among Australian players and crowds. During the season, Woodfull’s physical courage and dignified leadership won him many admirers. He refused to employ retaliatory tactics even though his men were repeatedly hit.<ref name="az"/> 

Australia lost heavily by ten wickets in the first Test at Sydney, when the bowling spearhead of Bodyline, [[Harold Larwood]], took ten wickets.<ref name="pollard"/> Before the second Test, Woodfull had to wait until minutes before the game before he was confirmed as captain by the selectors.<ref>O'Reilly, ''Bill (1985): Tiger - 60 Years of Cricket'', Collins. ISBN 0 00 217477 4. p 88.</ref> Although he led Australia to a dramatic victory in the game, his form was a problem - he had managed only 43 runs in the four innings so far.<ref name="cricinfo"/> 

The controversy reached its peak during the second day of the third Test. An all-time record [[Adelaide Oval]] crowd of 50,962<ref>Harte, Chris (1993): ''A History of Australian Cricket'', Andre Deutsch. ISBN 0 233 98825 4. p 346.</ref> watched Australia finish off England’s first innings for 341. Then, Woodfull opened Australia’s batting with [[Jack Fingleton]], who was dismissed straight away for a duck. Minutes later Larwood, bowling to a conventional field setting, struck Woodfull an agonising blow under his heart with a short, lifting delivery.<ref>Frith, David (2002): ''Bodyline Autopsy'', ABC Books. ISBN 0 7333 1321-3. p 179.</ref> As Woodfull bent down over his bat in pain for several minutes, the huge crowd began jeering and hooting. When play resumed, England’s Gubby Allen bowled an entire over to Don Bradman.<ref>Frith (2002), p 180</ref> Journalist-cricketer Dick Whitington, who was at the ground, later wrote on what happened next:

:As Larwood was about to deliver the first ball of his next over to Woodfull, Jardine held up play to switch to the “bodyline” field setting. This, to the huge Saturday afternoon crowd, was hitting a man when he was down, an unforgivable crime in Australian eyes and certainly no part of cricket. Mass hooting came after almost every ball. [Umpire] Hele believes that had what followed occurred in Melbourne the crowd would have leapt the fence and belaboured the English captain; Larwood, and possibly the entire side.<ref>Whitington, Dick (1974): ''The Book of Australian Test Cricket 1877-1974'', Wren Publishing. ISBN 0 85885 197 0. p 173.</ref>

During the over, another rising delivery knocked the bat out of Woodfull’s hands. He battled it out for 89 minutes, collecting more bruises before Allen Bowled him for 22.<ref>Frith (2002), p 182.</ref> Later in the day, the English team manager [[Pelham Warner]] visited the Australian dressing room to express his sympathies to Woodfull. Woodfull's abrupt response was leaked to the press and it became the most famous quotation of this tumultuous period in cricket history:<ref name="az"/>

{{cquote|I do not want to see you, Mr Warner. There are two teams out there. One is playing cricket and the other is not.<ref name="az"/>}}

Australian wicketkeeper Bert Oldfield was struck a severe blow to the head while batting on the third day of the match. Woodfull came onto the ground to help him back to the dressing room. During the fifth day's play the [[Cricket Australia|Australian Board of Control for International Cricket]]<ref>Frith (2002), pp 216-8.</ref> sent the following cable to the MCC in [[London]]:

{{cquote|Bodyline bowling has assumed such proportions as to menace the best interests of the game, making protection of the body by the batsman the main consideration. This is causing intensely bitter feeling between the players, as well as injury. In our opinion it is unsportsmanlike. Unless stopped at once it is likely to upset the friendly relations existing between Australia and England.<ref name="334notout">[http://www.334notout.com/bodyline/main.htm Bodyline: The History Section.] ''334notout.com''.  Retrieved 30 November 2006.</ref>}}

Jardine threatened to withdraw his team from the fourth and fifth Tests unless the Australian Board withdrew the accusation of unsporting behaviour. The MCC backed their captain but offered to abandon the tour. The standoff was settled only when [[Prime Minister of Australia|Australian Prime Minister]] [[Joseph Lyons]] warned the Australian Board of the severe economic hardships that could result if the British public boycotted Australian trade. Given this understanding, the Board withdrew the allegation of unsportsmanlike behaviour two days before the fourth Test, thus saving the tour.<ref>Frith, pp. 255-259.</ref>
[[Image:Woodfull&Richardson.jpg|left|thumb|Woodfull (left) walks out to open the batting with Vic Ricardson in the final Bodyline Test.]]
In the second innings at Adelaide, England set Australia an impossible 532 for victory. Australia lost its first wicket at three when [[Jack Fingleton]] was [[bowled]] by Larwood. Woodfull was joined by Bradman, who played in an unorthodox counterattacking method, before being dismissed for 66. Woodfull continued on to score an unbeaten 73, carrying his bat as his teammates capitulated around him. Australia was eventually all out for 193, with [[Bert Oldfield]] unable to bat due to a fractured skull.<ref name="pbody">Perry, pp.144-146</ref> 

Woodfull made scores of 67, 19, 14 and 67 in the final two Tests, which Australia lost; England reclaimed the Ashes 4-1.<ref name="az"/> Overall, he had scored 305 runs at a moderate 33.89 average - but significantly, he had defied the English bowling for over twenty hours in total, more than any other Australian. Eventually, rule changes were made to effectively outlaw the tactic by 1934.<ref name="pbody"/>

=== International farewell ===

In 1934, he lead Australia back to England on a tour which had been under a cloud after the cricket diplomacy of the previous Bodyline series. After agreements were put in place so that Bodyline would not be used. However, in a match against [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]], [[Bill Voce]], one of the bodyline bowlers of 1932-33, used it in Australia's first innings. Woodfull told the nottinghamshire administrators that if it were repeated in the second innings, his men would leave the field and return to [[London]]. In the second innings, Voce was absent with a "leg strain". Woodfull performed poorly, with 228 runs at 28.5, but it was sufficient for an Australian triumph as Bradman and Ponsford each averaged over 90 and [[Clarrie Grimmett]] and [[Bill O'Reilly (cricketer)|Bill O'Reilly]] each taking over 25 wickets. During his captaincy he was crticised for his relatively defensive strategy, tending to bat opponents out of the match instead of going for victory. Following Bodyline, he heavily relied on O'Reilly and Grimmett, using only three specialist bowlers as he sought to reinforce the batting line up.<ref name="p28-30"/> This made Woodfull the only captain to twice regain the Ashes. He scored 1268 runs at 52.83 during the tour with three centuries. Upon retiring immediately after he was awarded a joint testimonial with Ponsford on his return to Victoria.<ref name="az"/>

== Retirement ==
Outside cricket, Woodfull had a successful career as a [[mathematics]] [[teacher]] and headmaster at his ''[[alma mater]] '' Melbourne High School.<ref name="az"/> <!--He always considered his contributions to education more important than anything he ever did on the cricket field. One of his pupils was [[Keith Miller]], and the school oval was later named the Miller-Woodfull Oval.{{Fact}}--> The rejuvenated Maldon Oval in his home town was renamed the Bill Woodfull Recreation Reserve, and when the Great Southern Stand was constructed at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] in 1992, one of the entrances was named the Bill Woodfull Gate.<ref name="az"/>

Woodfull married Gwen King, who he met while singing in the choir at his father's church in [[albert Park, Victoria|Albert Park]], and they married after Woodfull's return from the [[England tour]] in 1926. They had three children.<ref name="p28-30">Perry, pp.147-148</ref>

In <!--[[1934]] he turned down the offer of a [[knighthood]] for services to cricket,{{Fact}} but in--> [[1963]] accepted an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] for services to education.<ref name="az"/> In 1965, he collapsed and died while playing golf in [[Tweed Heads]], [[New South Wales]].<ref name="cricinfo"/> Woodfull was inducted into the [[Australian Cricket Hall of Fame]] in [[2001]].<ref name="cricinfo"/>
