{{For|the album by Hugo|Time on Earth (Hugo album)}}
'''''Time on Earth''''' is the fifth studio album by the pop-rock band [[Crowded House]]. Tracks have been produced by both [[Ethan Johns]] and [[Steve Lillywhite]] and the album was released on [[June 30]], [[2007]] in Australia, [[July 2]], [[2007]] in the UK and [[July 10]], [[2007]] in North America.<ref name="pf">[http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/42575-johnny-marr-on-crowded-house-reunion-album Pitchfork Media], 04-25-07</ref> ''Time on Earth'' is the band's first studio album since [[1993]], and marks the reunion of the band eleven years after they disbanded and features new drummer [[Matt Sherrod]] in place of the original drummer, the late [[Paul Hester]], who took his own life in 2005.

As the first studio album from the group in fourteen years, ''Time on Earth'' has been subject to much speculation. Upon its release garnered much critical praise. The group's fans were hesitant to accept a drummer other than Hester initially, however embraced the new work by the group.

==Album history==
===Background===
The album was originally intended to be frontman [[Neil Finn]]'s third solo release.  In the wake of Paul Hester's death, as well as preparations for the release of the live album ''[[Farewell to the World]]'', the band members were drawn together and their friendship was reinvigorated.  Neil Finn invited bassist [[Nick Seymour]] to participate in the recording of his new album and subsequent tour. In the initial phase, various session musicians filled parts, such as studio musician [[Joey Waronker]] on drums and British soul singer [[Beth Rowley]] provided backup vocals for the song "Transit Lounge." After recording a complete album with Ethan Johns in the producer and drummer's seat and Seymour contributing substantially throughout the process, Finn decided Crowded House would reform and that ''Time on Earth'' would be the band's fifth studio album. 

With new drummer [[Matt Sherrod]] and returning multi-instrumentalist [[Mark Hart]] now involved as members of the official lineup, the band returned to the studio to record four additional tracks with producer Steve Lillywhite. Hart and Sherrod also contributed retroactively to some of the Ethan Johns-produced material.  In its final form, the album features tracks mixed by Johns, Lillywhite and [[Tchad Blake]]. Guitarist [[Johnny Marr]] was involved in the recording of "Even a Child" and "Don't Stop Now".<ref>[http://www.nme.com/news/crowded-house/27923 nme.com] - nme.com news article.</ref>

===Recording and production===
Due to the transient nature of the album, gradually adapting from a solo venture into a band effort, the recording process used on the album was somewhat unorthodox in that it encompassed various session musicians for the majority, while the "central lineup" of Finn, Seymour, Hart and Sherrod only performed on four tracks on the album, which includes "[[Don't Stop Now]]", the album's lead single. Before this point, most of the album was produced by [[Ethan Johns]], however from enlisting Sherrod and calling upon Hart to return, the prolific producer [[Steve Lillywhite]] took over.

===Pre-release performances===
To bring their music to the public before the album's release, the group played together a few times before the release. On March 17, 2007 the band played a 2 Â½ hour set streamed live to the internet from veteran musician [[Peter Gabriel]]'s studio ([[Real World Studios]]) in England. The following new songs from the album were played:
* "[[Silent House]]"
* "English Trees"
* "Pour Le Monde"
* "Transit Lounge"
* "She Called Up"
* "Heaven That I'm Making"
* "Nobody Wants To"
* "[[Don't Stop Now]]"

===Release===
The album had a staggered release internationally across a fortnight, starting with Australia and ending with the United States. Following the Australian release, the group performed at [[Live Earth]] in Australia, performing many of the album's songs.

===Critical reception===
The album has been very well received by critics and the public, with many critics praising the album as "a worthy successor to Crowded House's existing catalog".<ref>Hal Horowitz, Amazon Editor, [http://www.amazon.com/Time-Earth-Crowded-House/dp/B000Q9OD7G/ref=pd_sim_m_2_img/103-1262721-1921433 Amazon.com: Time on Earth]. Retrieved [[24 July]], [[2007]].</ref>.

==Cover art==
[[Image:Crowded House.jpeg|left|thumb|The stylised text for the band's name from the cover of ''Time on Earth'']]As he did for the first four Crowded House albums, Nick Seymour, also an artist, created the [[cover art]] for ''Time on Earth''. The group's name "Crowded House" appears with jumbled case, some lower and some upper case, appearing as "cRoWdED HOusE" and the album title also in a part jumble with all but the last two letters in upper case, appearing as "TIME ON EARth." The cover also features a blue dragon eating a human. This is to symbolise former member Hester being consumed by depression (symbolised by the dragon being blue) and this brought his time on earth to an early end. The cover art is almost completely composed of newspaper cuttings collaged together--even the image of the man and the dragon are newspaper cuttings which Seymour painted onto. Only the tree on the right, and the title text are not composed of newspaper cuttings. The human figure appears to be grasping at this newspaper-free title text; this may symbolize the figure's desire for freedom from all that a newspaper may represent (politics, consumerism, media manipulation, war: the horrors of modern life).  This also implies that a person's "time on earth" should not, ideally, be tainted by such things.  This same significance may be applied to the painted, newspaper-free tree, as it was under a tree in a Melbourne park where Paul Hester took his own life.

==Musical style==
{{Quote box|width=350|align=right|quote=It doesn't sound like any one particular Crowded House album, but it has elements of Crowded House... in as much as Nick and I make a sound together when we play and always did. I think there's a lot of heart and spirit in the album which is connected with the loss of our dear friend Paul but also an attempt to try and make sense of it and move forward. And as such, it seemed the most obvious and best way to do that was to be playing music again with each other, Nick and I. I want to be in a band and what other band could it be.|source=Neil Finn<ref>[http://www.farewelltotheworld.com EMI site] - video interview Feb. 2007</ref>}}
{{expandsectionsmall|[[25 July]], [[2007]]}}
Crowded House's leader, Neil Finn has indicated that, as the album began life as a solo project, its sound is generally different to Crowded House, though similar in parts, indicating that no one album by the group sounds like this one. As the album is dedicated to Hester and attends to his death, much of the album has a mournful tone, however this has been received well by critics, with some indicating that "fortunately, Finn is a master at expressing ambiguity, (both) lyrically and musically".<ref>Lewis, Randy; [http://www.calendarlive.com/music/cl-ca-rack8jul08,0,3140779.story "Crowded House reunites in grief -- and joy" - RECORD RACK - Los Angeles Times]. Released [[8 July]], [[2007]]. Retrieved [[25 Juky]], [[2007]].</ref>

==Charts==
''Time on Earth'' entered the Australian [[ARIA Albums Chart]] on [[8 July]] at #2, just behind [[Michael Buble]]'s ''[[Call Me Irresponsible]]'', however in its second week, it rose to the #1 position, swapping with ''Call Me Irresponsible'' which then moved to #2. It entered the [[RIANZ]] albums chart in [[New Zealand]] on [[9 July]], [[2007]] also at #2, though slipped to #3 in its second week, instead of rising as it did in Australia. As Crowded House's place of origin is held in contention due to being led by [[Neil Finn]] of New Zealand, however the band has always resided in and was formed in Australia. Due to this constant confusion, both [[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA]] and RIANZ consider the group to be native to their respective countries, as they're indicated as "local artists" in the album listings, on ARIA as a "red spot" and on RIANZ with the item highlighted in green.<ref>[http://rianz.org.nz/rianz/chart.asp RIANZ]. Retrieved [[15 July]], [[2007]].</ref><ref>[http://ariacharts.com.au/pages/charts_display.asp?chart=1A50 ARIA]. Retrieved [[15 July]], [[2007]].</ref> On the U.S. [[Billboard 200]], the album debuted at number 46, with about 16,000 copies sold in its first week.<ref>Hasty, Katie [http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003613204 "T.I. Holds Off Pumpkins, Interpol To Remain No. 1"], Billboard.com, July 18, 2007.</ref> The album entered the charts in the [[United Kingdom]] at #3 with sales of over 27,000, being Crowded House's most successful studio album on the UK charts, only being superceded by ''[[Recurring Dream]]'' which achieved a #1 position and sold over a million copies. It also entered the [[Canadian Albums Chart]] at #38.

==Track listing==
In April 2007, the band's website went live and included a confirmation of the track listing of ''Time on Earth''<ref name="pf">[http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/42575-johnny-marr-on-crowded-house-reunion-album Pitchfork Media], 04-25-07</ref>. Notably, the album has 14 tracks, only the second studio album by Crowded House to have as many, the previous being ''[[Woodface]]''. The album features the guitar work of [[Johnny Marr]], guitarist and songwriter of [[The Smiths]], on "Even a Child" and lead single "[[Don't Stop Now]];" Marr co-wrote the former song with Finn. The album also includes the song "[[Silent House]]", which Finn co-wrote with the [[Dixie Chicks]] (which also appeared on their 2006 [[Grammy]]-winning album ''[[Taking the Long Way]]''). With the Australian release, the CD unlocks an online exclusive download of an alternate version of the song "Silent House".
