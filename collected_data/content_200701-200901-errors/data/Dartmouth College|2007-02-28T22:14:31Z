'''Dartmouth College''' is a [[Private school|private]] academic institution in [[Hanover, New Hampshire|Hanover]], [[New Hampshire]], in the United States. It is a member of the [[Ivy League]] and is one of the nine colonial colleges founded before the American Revolution.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/home/about/facts.html | title = Dartmouth - About Dartmouth - Facts | publisher = Dartmouth College | accessdate = 2007-01-24 }}</ref>

Founded in 1769 by [[Eleazar Wheelock]], with funds partially raised by the efforts of a Native American preacher named [[Samson Occom]], it is the [[Colonial colleges|ninth-oldest college]] in the United States and the seventh-wealthiest in terms of funds per student.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~speccoll/Resources/DartmouthHistory/DartmouthHistory.shtml | title = A Dartmouth History Lesson for Freshman | first = Francis | last = Childs | accessdate = 2007-02-12 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/home/about/facts.html | title = Dartmouth - About Dartmouth - Facts | publisher = Dartmouth College | accessdate = 2007-01-24 }}</ref> In addition to its liberal arts undergraduate program, Dartmouth has medical, engineering, and business schools, as well as 21 graduate programs in the arts and sciences; hence it would tend to be called a [[university]] in standard American usage.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/home/about/facts.html | title = Dartmouth - About Dartmouth - Facts | publisher = Dartmouth College | accessdate = 2007-01-24 }}</ref> For the sake of tradition—in part stemming from the legacy of the landmark [[Dartmouth College v. Woodward|Dartmouth College Case]]—and in order to emphasize the central importance it gives to undergraduate education, however, it refers to itself as a [[college]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~speccoll/Resources/DartmouthHistory/DartmouthHistory.shtml | title = A Dartmouth History Lesson for Freshman | first = Francis | last = Childs | accessdate = 2007-02-12 }}</ref> With a total enrollment of 5,744 (4,078 of whom are undergraduates), Dartmouth is the smallest school in the Ivy League. It is incorporated as ''Trustees of Dartmouth College''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~trustees/ | title = Trustees of Dartmouth College | publisher = Dartmouth College | accessdate = 2007-02-12 }}</ref>

In 2005 [[Booz Allen Hamilton]] selected Dartmouth College as one of the "World's Ten Most Enduring Institutions," recognizing its ability to overcome crises that threatened its survival (most famously ''[[Dartmouth College v. Woodward|Trustees of Dartmouth College v.

Over many generations, Dartmouth has had one of the highest alumni donor participation rates.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

==History==
[[Image:Dartmouth College Baker building.jpg|thumb|right|275px|[[Baker Memorial Library]] at Dartmouth College]]
Dartmouth was made the final [[colonial college]] given a [[royal charter]] when [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] granted its charter in 1769, mostly as a result of the efforts of [[Eleazar Wheelock]], a [[Puritan]] minister, and his patron, Royal Governor [[John Wentworth (Lieutenant-Governor)|John Wentworth]]. (Queen's College, now Rutgers University, was granted a charter slightly earlier but did not begin operation until after Dartmouth.)

Dartmouth's original purpose was to provide for the Christianization, instruction, and education of "Youth of the Indian Tribes in this Land...and also of English Youth and any others."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~speccoll/Resources/DartmouthHistory/DartmouthHistory.shtml | title = A Dartmouth History Lesson for Freshman | first = Francis | last = Childs | accessdate = 2007-02-12 }}</ref> Ministers [[Nathaniel Whittaker]] and [[Samson Occom]] (an early Native American clergyman) raised funds for the college in England through an English trust among whose benefactors and trustees were prominent English statesmen, including King George III's future [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] in North America, [[William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth]], for whom Dartmouth College is named. The fundraising was meant to support Wheelock's ongoing [[Connecticut]] institution of 1754, Moor's Indian Charity School,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~library/Library_Bulletin/Nov1999/Hoefnagel_Close.html | title = Eleazar Wheelock's Two Schools | first = Dick | last = Hoefnagel | coauthors = Virginia L. Close | accessdate = 2007-01-24 }}</ref>  but Wheelock instead applied most of the funds to the establishment of Dartmouth College.  Wheelock established a collegiate department within Moor's Charity School in 1768 that he moved to Hanover with the rest of the school in 1770.<ref>Dick Hoefnagel with Virginia L. Close, ''Eleazar Wheelock and the Adventurous Founding of Dartmouth. College'' (Hanover, N.H.: Durand Press for Hanover Historical Society, 2002).</ref> The College granted its first degrees in 1771, obtaining a [[Dartmouth College Seal|seal]] to affix on them in 1773.  Dejected and betrayed, [[Samson Occom]] went on to form his own community of New England Indians called [[Brothertown Indians]] in Oneida country in upstate New York.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~speccoll/Resources/DartmouthHistory/DartmouthHistory.shtml | title = A Dartmouth History Lesson for Freshman | first = Francis | last = Childs | accessdate = 2007-02-12 }}</ref>

[[Image:DanielWebster DartmouthCollegeCase.jpg|left|thumb|308px|Painting by Robert Clayton Burns (1962) depicting Daniel Webster and the ''Dartmouth College Case'']]
In 1819, Dartmouth College was the subject of the historic [[Dartmouth College case]], in which the State of [[New Hampshire]]'s 1816 attempt to amend the College's royal charter to make the school a public university was challenged.  An institution called [[Dartmouth University]] occupied the college buildings and began operating in Hanover in 1817, though the College continued teaching classes in rented rooms nearby.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~speccoll/Resources/DartmouthHistory/DartmouthHistory.shtml | title = A Dartmouth History Lesson for Freshman | first = Francis | last = Childs | accessdate = 2007-02-12 }}</ref> [[Daniel Webster]], an [[alumnus]] of the class of 1801, presented the College's case to the [[United States Supreme Court]], which found the amendment of Dartmouth's charter to be an illegal impairment of a contract by the state and reversed New Hampshire's takeover of the College. Webster concluded his peroration with the famous and frequently-quoted words,
: ''It is, Sir, as I have said, a small college. And yet there are those who love it.''<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~speccoll/Resources/DartmouthHistory/DartmouthHistory.shtml | title = A Dartmouth History Lesson for Freshman | first = Francis | last = Childs | accessdate = 2007-02-12 }}</ref>

Dartmouth was a men's college until 1972, when women were first admitted as full-time students and undergraduate degree candidates.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.economicexpert.com/a/Dartmouth:College.html | title = Dartmouth College | fist=Economic Expert | accessdate = 2007-02-12 }}</ref>  At about the same time, Dartmouth adopted its unique "D-Plan", a schedule of year-round operation that allowed an increase in the enrollment (with the addition of females) without enlarging campus accommodations. The year is divided into four terms corresponding with the seasons; students are required to be in residence during their freshman year, sophomore year summer term, and senior year. One wag described it as a way to put 4,000 students into 3,000 beds.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.economicexpert.com/a/Dartmouth:College.html | title = Dartmouth College | work=Economic Expert | accessdate = 2007-02-12 }}</ref> Although new dormitories have been built since, the number of students has also increased and the D-Plan remains in effect.

Dartmouth's motto is "Vox Clamantis in Deserto". The Latin motto is literally translated as "The voice of one crying in the wilderness", but the College administration often translates the phrase as "A voice crying in the wilderness", which, while not technically correct in Latin grammar, attempts to translate the [[synecdoche]] of the phrase. The motto is a reference to the Christian Bible's [[John the Baptist]] as well as to the college's location on what was once the frontier of European settlement.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmo.com/index.php?cat=12 | title = Bartlett Hall’s Wheelock Memorial Window | publisher: Dartmo: The Buildings of Dartmouth College | accessdate = 2007-02-12 }}</ref> Richard Hovey's ''[[Men of Dartmouth]]'' was elected as the best of all the songs of the College in 1896, and today it serves as the school's alma mater, although the lyrics and title have since been changed to be gender-neutral.

The screenplay for the film ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House]]'' was cowritten by Chris Miller (A.B. 1963) and is based loosely on a series of  fictional stories he wrote in 1974 about his fraternity days at Dartmouth, including "The Night of the Seven Fires." In a CNN interview, [[John Landis]] said the movie was "based on Chris Miller's real fraternity at Dartmouth," [[Dartmouth College Greek organizations#Alpha Delta|Alpha Delta]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0308/29/se.09.html | title = Interview with John Landis| first = John | last = Landis | accessdate = 2007-02-12 }}</ref> In an interview with ''The Dartmouth,'' Miller said that at least one incident in the film&mdash;one in which a Delta Tau Chi brother skis down the stairs as the band plays "Shout"&mdash;occurred at an Alpha Delta party at Dartmouth.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.thedartmouth.com/article.php?aid=2004051401080&action=print | title = Alpha Delta Lawn Party is centerpiece of Green Key | first = Linzi | last = Sheldon | accessdate = 2007-02-12 }}</ref> The movie was filmed at the [[University of Oregon]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://libweb.uoregon.edu/speccoll/archives/ | title = Oregon University Archives | first = Heather | last = Briston | accessdate = 2007-02-12 }}</ref>

==Academics==
[[Image:Dartmouth College - Dartmouth Hall circa 1834.jpg|thumb|350px|Lithograph of Wentworth Hall, Dartmouth Hall, and Thornton Hall, circa 1834.]]	
The centerpiece of today's Dartmouth College is its undergraduate college of 4,078 students, constituting one of the most selective undergraduate institutions in the world.  For the Class of 2010, 13,933 students applied for a little over 1,000 places in the class, and only 15.4% of applicants were admitted.  Median SAT scores lie within the low 700s for each subject, and 93% of the members of the Class of 2010 graduated in the top ten percent of their high school class.  30% of the members of the Class of 2010 graduated as valedictorian, and 10% as salutatorian.<ref name="usnews">{{cite web | title=America's Best Colleges | year=2007 |  url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/college/rankings/brief/natudoc/tier1/t1natudoc_brief.php | publisher=US News and World Report | accessdate=2006-08-16}}</ref>

Alongside the undergraduate college lie small graduate schools, the [[Dartmouth Medical School]] (1797), the [[Thayer School of Engineering]] (1867), and the [[Tuck School of Business]] (1900). With these graduate programs, conventional American usage would accord Dartmouth the label of "[[Dartmouth University]]"; but because of the focus on the undergraduate body, as well as historical and nostalgic reasons (such as ''[[Dartmouth College v. Woodward]]''), the school uses the name "Dartmouth ''College''" for the entire institution.

===Academic reputation===
In 2007, Dartmouth College was ranked ninth (tied with [[Columbia University]] and the [[University of Chicago]]) among undergraduate programs at national universities by ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]''.<ref name="usnews">{{cite web | title=America's Best Colleges | year=2007 |  url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/college/rankings/brief/natudoc/tier1/t1natudoc_brief.php | publisher=US News and World Report | accessdate=2006-08-16}}</ref> However, since Dartmouth is ranked in a category for national [[Research university|research universities]], some have questioned the fairness of the ranking given the College's emphasis on undergraduate education.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.dartreview.com/archives/1998/09/30/dartmouth_ranked_tenth_best_college.php | title = Dartmouth Ranked Tenth Best College | first = Steven | last = Menash | work = [[The Dartmouth Review]] | date = [[1998-09-30]] | accessdate = 2007-01-24 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/college/rankings/brief/natudoc/tier1/t1natudoc_brief.php | title = College ranks ninth for six years running| first = Linzi | last = Sheldon | work = [[The Dartmouth]] | date = [[2005-08-23]] | accessdate = 2007-01-24 }}</ref> The 2006 Carnegie Foundation classification <ref>{{cite web | url = http://carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/ | title = The Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education | publisher = The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching | accessdate = 2007-01-01 }}</ref> listed Dartmouth as the only majority-undergraduate, arts-and-sciences focused institution in the country that also had very high research activity.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/sub.asp?key=748&subkey=15105&start=782 | title = Classifications: Dartmouth College | publisher = The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching | accessdate = 2007-01-02 }}</ref>

===Dartmouth's Honor Principle===
Dartmouth College has a well-established Honor Principle that binds all students to be responsible for each other's learning.  Exams are not proctored, take-home exams are common, and students are entrusted with the responsibility not to cheat.  "On February 1, 1962, a majority vote of the student body adopted the principle that 'all academic activities will be based on student honor' and thereby accepted the responsibility, individually and collectively, to maintain and perpetuate the principle of academic honor."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~deancoll/documents/handbook/conduct/standards/honor.html | title = Dartmouth's Honor Principle | publisher = Dartmouth College | accessdate = 2007-02-26 }}</ref>

===Board of Trustees===
Dartmouth is governed by a Board of Trustees.  The board includes the College president and the state governor (both ''ex officio''), eight trustees appointed by the board itself (Charter Trustees), and eight trustees (Alumni Trustees) nominated for board appointment by members of the Association of Alumni of Dartmouth College, a body created in 1854 that represents over 60,000 alumni. (Specifically, trustee candidates may be nominated by an alumni council or by alumni petition, then an election is held, and finally the winner is, by longstanding agreement, appointed to the board by all Trustees. Three recent petition candidates have become Trustees in this manner.)

==Facilities==
===Hopkins Center for the Creative and Performing Arts===
{{main|Hopkins Center for the Arts}}
The [http://hop.dartmouth.edu/ Hopkins Center] ("the Hop") houses the College's drama, music, film, and studio arts departments, as well as a woodshop, pottery studio, and jewelry studio which are open for use by students and faculty. The building was designed by the famed architect [[Wallace Harrison]], who later modeled [[City of New York|Manhattan’s]] [[Lincoln Center]] front façade after the Hopkins Center.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~news/releases/2002/nov/110402b.html | title = The Hopkins Center Turns 40 | first = Tamara | last = Steinert | accessdate = 2007-02-12 }}</ref> Facilities include two recital halls and one large auditorium. It is also the location of all student mailboxes ("Hinman boxes") and the Courtyard Café dining facility. The Hop is connected to the Hood Museum of Art and the Loew Auditorium, where films are shown. The Hopkins Center is an important New Hampshire performance venue.

===Nelson A. Rockefeller Center for Public Policy and the Social Sciences===
The Nelson A. Rockefeller Center is a center for interaction and discussion on public policy.  Dedicated in 1983, the center stands in tribute to [[Nelson A. Rockefeller]] (Class of 1930).  Known on campus as '''Rocky,''' the Center provides students, faculty and community-members opportunities to discuss and learn about public policy, law, and politics.  Sponsoring lunch and dinner discussions with prominent faculty and visitors, the Center aides provides close interaction and discussion.

The Rockefeller Center has established a Public-Policy Minor at Dartmouth College and an exchange program on political economy with Oxford University (Keble College).  In addition, the Center provides grants to students engaged in public-policy research and/or activities.

The Rockefeller Center's Policy Research Shop is an innovative program that provides research upon the request of elected policy makers and their legislative staff throughout the year. The Center hires students to work under the direction of faculty members, who then produce reports that are typically between 5-15 pages long. The intent is to produce useful information in a timely fashion so that the information can be used in legislative deliberations.

===The John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding===
The John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding was established in 1982 to honor Dartmouth's twelfth president (1945-70), [[John Sloan Dickey]]. The purpose of the Dickey Center is to "coordinate, sustain, and enrich the international dimension of liberal arts education at Dartmouth." To this end, the Dickey Center is committed to helping Dartmouth students prepare for a world in which local, national and global concerns are more strongly linked than ever. It strives to promote quality scholarly research at Dartmouth concerning international problems and issues, with an emphasis on work that is innovative and cross-disciplinary. And it seeks to heighten public awareness and to stimulate debate on pressing international issues. The Dickey Center also hosts several student-run organizations, such as the Dartmouth World Affairs Council (WAC) or the War & Peace Fellows, which foster undergraduates' awareness of international affairs. Several grants and awards are also administered by the Dickey Center, including the prestigious Chase Peace Prize, conferred annually to the senior thesis that contributes most significantly to an understanding of the causes of peace and war.

===Aquatic facilities===
[[Dartmouth College Alumni Gymnasium|Alumni Gym]] hosts two pools, the Karl Michael Competition Pool and the Spaulding Pool.  Together they comprise a total of fifteen 25-yard lanes and two 50-meter lanes. The Karl Michael Pool, constructed in 1962, was designed  by former [[Dartmouth College Men's Varsity Swim Team]] captain R. Jackson Smith, class of 1936.  In 1970, it was formally named the Karl Michael Pool, after the coach of the men's varsity swim team from 1939-1970. The pool features eleven 25-yard lanes, with a special bulkhead that can be lowered to create two 50 meter lanes.   The pool area has a seating area for 1,200 spectators.  The Michael Pool hosted the 1968 Men's [http://www.ncaa.org/ NCAA] Championships, in which several American records were set.  The pool also features one and three meter diving boards, with a water well 12 to 14 feet deep.  

Adjacent is the Spaulding Pool.  Spaulding Pool is a 10 by 25 yard pool constructed during 1919 and 1920 and designed by [[Rich & Mathesius, Architects]]. The Spaulding Pool is one of the oldest continuously operating pools in the [[United States]].  The pool's interior walls feature original encaustic tiles designed by noted ceramist Leon Victor Solon, although a later mezzanine housing locker rooms has obscured some of the designs.  The pool has seating for several hundred spectators.  Both pools are currently used by the Men's and Women's Varsity Swim Teams, as well as a host of other programs within the college.

===Housing clusters===
{{main|Dartmouth College residential communities}}
As opposed to ungrouped dormitories or [[residential colleges]] as employed at such institutions as [[The University of Chicago]] and [[Yale University|Yale]], Dartmouth has several housing clusters located throughout campus. The College experienced a slight housing crunch due to the unusually high yield of the class of 2005. Partially as a result, the College erected temporary housing, and two new dormitory clusters were completed in the fall of 2006. Also starting in 2006, the College will guarantee housing for students during their freshman and sophomore years.

==Athletics==
As of 2004, Dartmouth College hosts 34 varsity sports: sixteen for men, sixteen for women, and coeducational sailing and equestrian programs. This places it among the top [[United States]] colleges and universities in this regard.  In addition, there are twenty-three club sports and twenty-four intramural sports.  

===Nickname, symbol, and mascot===
Since the 1920s, the Dartmouth College athletic teams have been known by their unofficial nickname "The Big Green."  The nickname is based on students' adoption of a shade of forest green ("Dartmouth Green") as the school's official color in 1866, leading to the nickname "The Green" soon after.  Until the early 1970s, teams were also known as the "[[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]]s," and athletic uniforms bore a representation of an Indian warrior's head.  That representation and similar images, called collectively "the Indian Symbol," as well as the practice of a cheerleader dressing in Indian costume to serve as a mascot during games, came under criticism. During the early 1970s the Trustees declared the "use of the [Indian] symbol in any form to be inconsistent with present institutional and academic objectives of the College in advancing Native American education."<ref>{{cite news | url = http://dartmouthsports.xosn.com/ViewArticle.dbml?&DB_OEM_ID=11600&ATCLID=590538| title = The 'Big Green' Nickname | publisher = DartmouthSports.com | date = [[2007-01-10]] | accessdate = 2007-01-24 }}</ref>  Some alumni and a minority of students, as well as the conservative student newspaper, ''[[The Dartmouth Review]]'', have sought to return the Indian symbol to prominence, but no team has worn the symbol on its uniform in decades. (Representations of Native Americans do remain on the [[Dartmouth College Seal]], the Dartmouth Coat of Arms (see above), and the weather vane of Baker Library.) 

Various student initiatives have been undertaken to adopt a new mascot, but none has garnered sufficient support from students or alumni to become "official." One proposal devised by the college humor magazine, the ''[[Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern]]'', was [[Keggy the Keg]], an [[anthropomorphic]] beer keg who makes occasional appearances at college sporting events, but Keggy has only received approval from the student government.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~jacko/keggy/index.htm| title = Keggy the Keg | publisher = The Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern | date = [[2007-01-10]] | accessdate = 2007-01-24 }}</ref> In November 2006, after an absence of several years, there was a revival of interest in making the Moose (or Dartmoose) the official mascot of Dartmouth, reaching the level of student government.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.thedartmouth.com/article.php?aid=2007011001020| title = First SA meeting draws crowd | first = Allie | last = Lowe | work = [[The Dartmouth]] | date = [[2007-01-10]] | accessdate = 2007-01-24 }}</ref> This occurred following renewed controversy surrounding the former Indian mascot.

===Varsity teams===
{{main|Dartmouth College athletic teams}}

Dartmouth's varsity athletic teams compete in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[Division I]], in the eight-member [[Ivy League]] conference.  Some teams also participate in the [[Eastern College Athletic Conference]] (ECAC). Dartmouth athletes compete in 34 varsity sports. In addition to the traditional American [[team sport]]s ([[American football|football]], [[basketball]], [[baseball]] and [[ice hockey]]), Dartmouth competes in many others including [[track and field]], [[sailing]],tennis, [[rowing (sport)|rowing]], [[soccer]], [[skiing]], and [[lacrosse]]. Many are highly competitive at the national level, earning berths into NCAA championships and tournaments.

As is mandatory amongst all Ivy League, Dartmouth College does not offer athletic scholarships. Despite this restriction, it is home to many student athletes. As many as three-quarters of Dartmouth undergraduates participate in some form of athletics, and one-quarter of Dartmouth students play a varsity sport at some point during their undergraduate years. The percentage of varsity athletes and varsity sports are thus disproportionately greater than at many much larger colleges in the country.

In addition to varsity sports, Dartmouth students may also participate in several club sports, such as [[College rugby|rugby]], [[water polo]], figure skating, men's volleyball and [[Ultimate (sport)|ultimate frisbee]]. These teams generally perform well in their respective regional and national competitions. The figure skating team has performed particularly well in recent years, winning the national championship in each of the past three consecutive seasons.

===Venues===
Dartmouth hosts many athletic venues.  [[Dartmouth College Alumni Gymnasium|Alumni Gymnasium]], the center of athletic life at Dartmouth, is home of the Dartmouth College aquatic facilities, basketball courts, [[Squash (sport)|squash]] and [[racketball]] courts, indoor track, [[fencing (sport)|fencing]] lanes as well as a [[sport rowing|rowing]] training center.  The College also maintains the [[Memorial Field (Dartmouth)|Memorial Field]] [[American football|football]] stadium, [[Leede Arena|Edward Leede Arena]] (basketball), and [[Thompson Arena|Rupert C. Thompson Arena]] ([[hockey]]), as well as a rowing boat house and a tennis complex. The Boss Tennis Complex was recently awarded national tennis center of the year.  

Dartmouth's original sports field was the Green, where students played [[cricket]] during the late eighteenth century and [[Old Division Football]] during the 1800s; some intramural games still take place there.

==Student life==
===Student groups===
{{main|Dartmouth College student groups}}
Dartmouth hosts a large number of student groups, covering a wide range of interests.  Students are commonly involved in more than one group on campus. As of 2006, the College hosted at least 11 literary publications, 8 a-capella groups, 10 other musical groups, and over 200 organizations recognized by the "Council of Student Organizations". Notable student groups include ''[[The Dartmouth]]'', one of America's oldest college newspapers (established in 1799), ''[[The Dartmouth Review]]'', an independent conservative newspaper, [[Dartmouth College student groups#Dartmouth Film Society|The Dartmouth Film Society]], the nation's oldest college film society, and award-winning a-cappella groups like [[Dartmouth College student groups#The Dartmouth Aires|The Dartmouth Aires]] and [[Dartmouth College student groups#The Dartmouth Cords|The Dartmouth Cords]].

===Greek life===
{{main|Dartmouth College Greek organizations}}

Dartmouth College is host to many [[Greek organizations]] and a large percentage of the [[undergraduate]] student body is active in Greek life.  In 2000, nearly half of the undergraduate student body belonged to a [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]], [[sorority]], or [[coeducational]] Greek house.  First year students are not allowed to join Greek organizations, however, so the actual fraction of Dartmouth students that become active in Greek life during their studies at the College exceeds half of the student body.  Dartmouth College was among the first institutions of higher education to [[desegregate]] fraternity houses in the 1950s, and was involved in the movement to create [[coeducational]] Greek houses in the 1970s.  In the early 2000s, campus-wide debate focused on whether or not the Greek system at Dartmouth should become "substantially coeducational," but most houses retain single-sex membership policies.  The college has an additional classification of social/residential orginazations known as [[Dartmouth College student groups#Undergraduate societies|undergraduate societies]].  These organizations are not part of the official Greek system, but serve a similar role on campus.

===Technology===
Technology plays an important role in student life, as Dartmouth has been ranked as one of the most technologically-advanced colleges in the world (as in ''[[Newsweek]]'s'' ranking of "Hottest for the Tech-Savvy"<ref name="newsweek">{{cite news | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5626574/site/newsweek/ | date = August 2004 | first = Barbara | last = Kantrowitz | work = [[Newsweek]] | title = America's 25 Hot Schools | accessdate = 2007-01-24 }}</ref>). [[BlitzMail]], the campus [[e-mail]] network, plays a tremendous role in social life, as students tend to use it for communication in lieu of [[cellular phones]] or [[instant messaging]] programs. <ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.thedartmouth.com/article.php?aid=2005100501040 | work = [[The Dartmouth]] | title = Cell phones make inroads on Blitz-centric College campus | date = [[2005-10-05]] | first = Jennifer | last = Garfinkel | accessdate = 2007-01-24 | quote = While BlitzMail remains the preferred method of communication, cell phones have become more common. }}</ref> Although there are more than 12,000 computers available for use on campus, student reliance on BlitzMail (known colloquially as "Blitz," which functions as both noun and verb) has led to computer terminals being installed all around campus, so that students can check their "blitz" in between classes or while away from their rooms.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/learnmore/school.html | publisher = Dartmouth College | title = The Basics About Dartmouth | accessdate = 2007-01-24 }}</ref>

Dartmouth was also notable as the first Ivy League institution to offer entirely ubiquitous wireless internet access.<ref name="newsweek"/> With over 1,300 wireless access points, the wireless network is available throughout all college buildings as well as in most public outdoor spaces.<ref name="Computing at Dartmouth">{{cite news | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/comp/resources/network/wireless/focus/facts.html/ | date = May 2005 | first = Susan | last = Knapp | work = Dartmouth College Computer Services | title = Wireless Network Facts | accessdate = 2007-02-12 }}</ref> Other technologies being pioneered include college-wide Video-on-Demand and VoIP rollouts.<ref name="Dartmouth Public Affiars">{{cite news | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~news/releases/2005/05/04.html/ | date = May 2005 | first = Susan | last = Knapp | work = Dartmouth College Office of Public Affairs | title = Phones, television and computers converge at Dartmouth | accessdate = 2007-02-12 }}</ref><ref name="Computing at Dartmouth">{{cite news | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/comp/resources/network/wireless/focus/facts.html/ | date = May 2005 | first = Susan | last = Knapp | work = Dartmouth College Computer Services | title = Wireless Network Facts | accessdate = 2007-02-12 }}</ref>

===Native Americans at Dartmouth===

The charter of Dartmouth College, granted to [[Eleazar Wheelock]] in [[1769]], proclaims that the institution was created "for the education and instruction of Youth of the Indian Tribes in this Land in reading, writing and all parts of Learning ... as well as in all liberal Arts and Sciences; and also of English Youth and any others."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~nap/about/ | title = About the Native American Program | first = Dartmouth College | accessdate = 2007-02-12 }}</ref> The funds for Dartmouth College were raised primarily by the efforts of a Native American named [[Samson Occom]].

While Dartmouth's students since have mainly been white, the college still claims to have a long history of involvement with Indian education.  In 1970 the school established Native American academic and social programs as part of a "new dedication to increasing Native American enrollment."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~nap/about/ | title = About the Native American Program | first = Dartmouth College | accessdate = 2007-02-12 }}</ref>

Wheelock, a Congregationalist dedicated to converting Indians to Christianity, was head of Moor's Indian Charity School (1753) prior to establishing Dartmouth.  It was this institution that Mohegan preacher [[Samson Occom]] raised money for; Occom was bitterly disappointed to see Wheelock transform it into an English college.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~speccoll/Resources/DartmouthHistory/DartmouthHistory.shtml | title = A Dartmouth History Lesson for Freshman | first = Francis | last = Childs | accessdate = 2007-02-12 }}</ref>

=== Traditions ===
[[Image:2004_Winter_Carnival_Sculpture.JPG|thumb|200px|Snow Sculpture at the 2004 Dartmouth Winter Carnival.]]
{{main|Dartmouth College traditions}}
Dartmouth is home to a variety of traditions and celebrations:
*'''Homecoming''' and '''Dartmouth Night''': Each fall term, a bonfire is constructed by the freshman class, a tradition stemming from the late 1800s. Freshman run around the bonfire in accordance with their class year (e.g. the class of 2009 ran 109 laps).
*'''Winter Carnival''': Founded in 1909 by the [[Dartmouth Outing Club]] to promote winter sports, this celebration includes a snow sculpture on the Green and a variety of outdoor events. Winter Carnival was the subject of the 1939 motion picture comedy ''Winter Carnival'', starring [[Ann Sheridan]].
*'''Green Key Weekend''': The spring Green Key Weekend began in the 1920s with a formal function related to the Green Key Society, but the importance of the Society in the weekend is largely diminished. Green Key is today a weekend devoted to campus parties and celebration.
*'''Tubestock''': Tubestock was an unofficial summer tradition in which the sophomore class used wooden rafts and inner tubes to float on the [[Connecticut River]].  Begun in 1986, Tubestock met its demise in 2006 when Hanover town ordinances and a lack of coherent student protest conspired to defeat the popular tradition.
*'''Fieldstock''': The class of 2008, during their summer term on campus in 2006, attempted to replace the now-defunct Tubestock with Fieldstock. The student government coordinated with the college to organize a day of events in the BEMA (Big Empty Meeting Area) and on the Green, including a free barbecue, live music, and the revival of the 1970s and 1980s tradition of racing homemade chariots around the Green. Unlike Tubestock, Fieldstock was college funded and supported, though whether or not it becomes a true college tradition will depend on whether the class of 2009 chooses to hold it again in the summer of 2007.
*'''Freshman trips''': Prior to [[matriculation]], the Dartmouth Outing Club sponsors four-day freshman outing trips for incoming freshman. Each trip concludes at the [[Moosilauke Ravine Lodge]].
*'''Dartmouth [[Pow-wow|Pow-Wow]]''': A two-day ceremony is marked by traditional dancing, crafts, music and art, held every spring since 1973. The Pow-Wow is organized by the student group Native Americans at Dartmouth.

==Seal==
[[Image:Dartseal.gif|thumb|Seal of Dartmouth College of Hanover, New Hampshire, USA]]
Dartmouth College received a royal charter on [[December 13]], [[1769]] through New Hampshire's colonial governor [[John Wentworth]]. The charter required a [[Seal (device)|seal]] that was to be:

{{cquote|engraven in such a form and with such an inscription as shall be devised by the said Trustees for the time being or by the major part of any seven or more of them convened for the service of the said College as is above directed.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmo.com/charter/charter.html#324 | title = The Charter of Dartmouth College | publisher = Dartmo | accessdate = 2007-01-24 }}</ref>}}

Nevertheless, on [[March 13]], [[1770]], founder [[Eleazar Wheelock]] wrote the trustees of the English fund that was supporting the college (rather than the American trustees of the institution itself, as the charter stipulated) to suggest that his

{{cquote|Patrons would devise a proper Seal for the College with one of the Gentlemans coat of arms upon it, if they shall think Proper this motto around it Vox Clamantis in Deserto this may also Serve a proper Seal for the Commissions of the Missionaries, as well for Diplomas, and be a Standing Evidence and monitor to succeeding Generations of the Original Design of this Institution.<ref>Dartmouth College Library, Special Collections MS 770213.2</ref>}}

The English trustees, including Lord Dartmouth, did not take up the suggestion. Evidence exists that they were annoyed with Wheelock's acquisition of a charter for a college; they were under the impression that the funds under their control were to be used to support Wheelock's efforts at educating and Christianizing Native Americans at Moor's Indian Charity School at Lebanon, Connecticut.<ref name="good">{{cite web | first = Jonathan | last = Good | title = Notes from the Special Collections: The Dartmouth College Seal | work = Dartmouth College Library Bulletin | issue = NS 37 | date = April, 1997 | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~library/Library_Bulletin/Apr1997/Good.html | accessdate = 2007-01-24 }}</ref> Wheelock then designed a seal for his college bearing a striking resemblance to the seal of the [[Society for the Propagation of the Gospel]], a missionary society founded in London in 1701, in order to maintain the illusion that his college was more for mission work than for higher education. Wheelock arranged for [[Nathaniel Hurd]], a Boston silversmith, to engrave the seal. Hurd had engraved many coats of arms and appears in a [[John Singleton Copley]] portrait of ca. 1765 with two books, one of which is ''A Display of Heraldry'' by [[John Guillim]] (1610). <ref>John Singleton Coppley, Portrait of Nathaniel Hurd, c. 1765, at the [http://www.clemusart.com/museum/collect/world/hurd.html Cleveland Museum of Art]</ref> Wheelock wrote to Governor Wentworth on [[May 22]], [[1772]], 'I hope that Mr Hurd will have the College Seal compleated by Commencement.'  <ref>{{cite news | first = Dick | last = Hoefnagel | coauthors = Virginia L. Close | title = Journey to Hanover, 1771 | work = Dartmouth College Library Bulletin | issue = NS 36 | date = November 1995 | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~library/Library_Bulletin/Nov1995/LB-N95-Close.html | publisher = Dartmouth College Library | accessdate = 2007-01-24 }}</ref> The seal (a single-sided "female" die used to form impressions in wax) was ready by Commencement of 1773, and Portsmouth resident and former Chief Justice and Treasurer of the Province of New Hampshire [[George Jaffrey]] donated it to the college.  The trustees officially accepted the seal on [[August 25]], [[1773]], describing it as:

{{cquote|An Oval, circumscribed by a Line containing SIGILL: COL: DARTMUTH: NOV: HANT: IN AMERICA 1770. within projecting a Pine Grove on the Right, whence proceed Natives towards an Edifice two Storey on the left; which bears in a Label over the Grove these Words "vox clamantis in deserto" the whole supported by Religion on the Right and Justice on the Left, and bearing in a Triangle irradiate, with the Hebrew Words [El Shaddai], agreeable to the above Impression, be the common Seal under which to pass all Diplomas or Certificates of Degrees, and all other Affairs of Business of and concerning Dartmouth College.<ref>Dartmouth College, Trustees' Records, 1:26. Dartmouth College Library, Special Collections, DA-1.</ref>}}

Former College Librarian William Woodward hid the seal from Dartmouth's officers along with the charter and four account books after the state of New Hampshire purported to take over the operation of Dartmouth College (and purported to make Woodward Treasurer of [[Dartmouth University]]). The [[Dartmouth College Case]] named Woodward as the defendant and technically sought to recover the items that he had hidden.<ref>{{cite web | title = Trustees of Dartmouth College vs. Woodward, 17 U.S. 518 (1819) | url = http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0017_0518_ZS.html | publisher = Cornell Law School Legal Information Institute | accessdate = 2007-01-24 }}</ref> The college's success in the [[Supreme Court]] returned the seal to its possession and extinguished the University.

In 1876, the college switched from having its seal impress wax to having it impress paper. This required a second, "male" die to fit under the original.<ref name="good"/> The seal design was also carved in sandstone on the exterior of Rollins Chapel in 1886 and in wood on the interior of Commons in 1901.  	 
 		 
On [[October 28]], [[1926]], the trustees affirmed the charter's reservation of the seal for official corporate documents alone.<ref name="good"/> The College Publications Committee under [[Ray Nash]] commissioned typographer [[W. A. Dwiggins]] to create a line-drawing version of the seal in 1940 that saw widespread use. 	 
 		 
Dwiggins' design was modified during 1957 to change the date from "1770" to "1769," to accord with the date of the College Charter. The trustees commissioned a new set of dies with a date of "1769" to replace the old dies, now badly worn after almost two hundred years of use.<ref name="good"/> The [[1957]] design continues to be used under trademark number 2305032.<ref name="uspatent">{{cite web | url = http://www.uspto.gov/main/trademarks.htm | title = United States Patent and Trademark Office | accessdate = 2007-01-24 }}</ref> 	 
	 
===Other insignia=== 	 
====Shield==== 	 
On [[October 28]], [[1926]], the Trustees approved a "Dartmouth College Shield" for general use. Artist and engraver [[W. Parke Johnson]] designed this emblem on the basis of the shield that is depicted at the center of the original seal. This design does not survive. On [[June 9]], [[1944]] the trustees approved another [[coat of arms]] based on the shield part of the seal, this one by [[Canadian]] artist and designer [[Thoreau MacDonald]]. That design was used widely and, like Dwiggins' seal, had its date changed from "1770" to "1769" around 1958.<ref name="good"/> That version continues to be used under trademark registration number 3112676 and others.<ref name="uspatent"/> 	 
		 
College designer [[John Scotford]] made a stylized version of the shield during the 1960s, but it did not see the success of MacDonald's design.<ref>{{cite web | first = Jonathan | last = Good | title = A Proposal for a Heraldic Coat of Arms for Dartmouth College | url = http://faculty.reinhardt.edu/good/dartmouthcoatarms.htm | accessdate = 2007-01-24 }}</ref> The shield appears to have been used as the basis of the shield of the [[Dartmouth Medical School]], and it has been reproduced in sizes as small as a few nanometers across.<ref>{{cite web | first = Joe | last = Nabity | url = http://www.jcnabity.com/dartseal.htm | title = Nanometer Pattern Generation System: Dartmouth Seal | accessdate = 2007-01-24 }}</ref> The design has appeared on [[Rudolph Ruzicka]]'s Bicentennial Medal ([[Philadelphia Mint]], 1969) and elsewhere. It appears most commonly in public in the form of a negative rendering on emergency-phone lampposts around Dartmouth's campus.

====The Arms of William Legge, Second Earl of Dartmouth==== 	 
Although an institution's adoption of the arms of its founder is not strictly appropriate, it is frequently done; Legge was not the founder of Dartmouth College, but he is its namesake, and the school has repeated his arms on several occasions. The 1830s banner of the Dartmouth Phalanx militia unit depicted Legge's arms, as did a nineteenth-century sign for the privately-owned Dartmouth Hotel. The 1920s College Flag depicts the arms, as do an early-century edition of ''The Dartmouth College Song Book'' and a 1960s banner hanging in Alumni Hall.
