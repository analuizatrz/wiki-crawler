'''Belarus''' ({{IPAEng|ˈbɛləruːs}}) ([[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]: Беларусь, [[BGN/PCGN romanization of Belarusian|transliteration]]: ''Byelarus’'') {{Audio|Belarus.ogg|listen}} is a [[landlocked country]] in [[Eastern Europe]] which borders [[Russia]] to the east, [[Ukraine]] to the south, [[Poland]] to the west, and [[Lithuania]] and [[Latvia]] to the north. Its capital is [[Minsk]]; other major cities include [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]], [[Hrodna|Grodno]], [[Homyel|Gomel]], [[Mogilev]], [[Vitebsk]] and [[Babruysk|Bobruisk]]. A third of the country is forested, and agriculture and manufacturing are the economic staples of Belarus. 

Until the 20th century, the [[Belarusians|Belarusian nation]] lacked the opportunity to form their national polity, as the lands of modern-day Belarus belonged to several countries, including the [[Duchy of Polatsk]], the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], and the [[Russian Empire]]. After the failure of a short-lived [[Belarusian People's Republic]] (1918–19), Belarus became a [[Republics of the Soviet Union|constituent republic of the Soviet Union]], the [[Byelorussian SSR]]. 

The final unification of the Belarusian lands in the modern borders took place in 1939, when the ethnically Belarusian lands that were a part of [[Second Polish Republic|interwar Poland]] were annexed by the USSR and attached to the Soviet Belarus. The territory and its nation were devastated in [[World War II]] as Belarus lost about a quarter of its population, with the loss of more than half of the republic's economic resources;<ref name="axell">{{cite book | last = Axell | first = Albert | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Russia's Heroes, 1941-45 | publisher = Carroll & Graf Publishers | date = 2002 | location = | pages = 247 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 078671011X }}</ref> but the republic recovered in the post-war years and became one of the founding members of the [[United Nations]]. The parliament of the republic declared the sovereignty of Belarus on [[July 27]], [[1990]] and following the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)|collapse of the Soviet Union]], Belarus officially declared independence on [[August 25]] [[1991]]. Since 1994, [[Alexander Lukashenko]] has been the country's president. During his presidency, Lukashenko has implemented Soviet-era policies, despite objections from Western governments. Belarus is negotiating with Russia to unify into a single state called the [[Union of Russia and Belarus]], although the discussions have stalled for several years.

A total population of about 9,849,000<ref>{{cite web|url=http://un.by/en/aboutbelarus/population/ |title= UN in Belarus > About Belarus > Population |accessdate=2007-10-07 }}</ref> reside in Belarus, mostly in the urban areas surrounding Minsk and other [[oblast]] (regional) capitals. More than 80% of the population are native Belarusians, with sizable minorities of Russians, Ukrainians and Poles. Since a referendum in 1995, the two official languages spoken in Belarus are [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. Belarus has no official religion; the primary religion in the country is [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]].

== Etymology ==
<!-----If you're here to add various translations to "White Russia" to the article, please do not add any more in. We got plenty of them.----->
Historically, the country was referred to in [[English language|English]] as "[[White Russia]]", although this is a slight mis-translation. The correct translation is "White [[Ruthenia]]" ('White Rus' phonetically), which either describes the area of Eastern Europe populated by Slavic people or the various states that occupied the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.halgal.com/ruthenian.html |title=An Understanding of the Terms 'Ruthenia' and 'Ruthenians |accessdate=2007-03-18 |last=Bielawa |first=Matthew |date=2002 |work=Genealogy of Halychyna/Eastern Galicia }}</ref> The first use of the term "White Russia" appeared in German and Latin [[medieval]] literature. The Latin term for the area, ''Russia Alba'', is derived from the area of present-day [[Albania]],  where the inhabitants had very white skin and dogs that could kill large animals. The only area that fit the Latin description was the Great Novgorod, but it was never called White Russia at all.<ref name="alies">{{cite book | last = Alies | first = Bely | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The chronicle of the White Russia: an essay on the history of one geographical name | publisher = Encyclopedix | date = 2000 | location = Minsk, Belarus | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 985-6599-12-1 }}</ref> Nonetheless, usage of the term 'White Russia' continues in many languages, e.g. "Weißrussland" in German, "Beyaz Rusya" in Turkish, "Λευκορωσία" (Leukorosía) in Greek, "Fehéroroszország" in Hungarian (see [[wiktionary:Belarus|here]] for the full list). 

The first known use of the term "White Russia" to refer to Belarus was in the late sixteenth century by Englishman Sir [[Jerome Horsey]]. During the seventeenth century, Russian [[tsar]]s used "White [[Ruthenia|Rus']]", asserting that they were trying to recapture their heritage from the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].<ref name="alies"/>

Belarus was named "Belorussia" ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Белоруссия) in the days of [[Imperial Russia]], and the Russian tsar was usually styled "Czar of [[Russia|All the Russias]] — [[Great Russia|Great]], [[Little Russia|Little]], and [[White Russia|White]]". "Belorussia" was the only [[Russian language]] name of the country (its names in other languages such as English being based on the Russian form) until 1991, when the Supreme Soviet of the [[Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]] decreed by law that the new independent republic should be called "Belarus" (Беларусь) in Russian and in all other language transcriptions of its name. The change was made to reflect adequately the [[Belarusian language]] form of the name.<ref>[http://pravo.kulichki.com/zak/year1991/doc47159.htm The law determining the name of the country]. Reviewed [[October 6]], [[2007]].</ref> Accordingly, the name "Belorussia" was replaced by "Belarus" in English, and, to some extent, in Russian (although the traditional name still persists in that language as well); likewise, the adjective "Belorussian" or "Byelorussian" was replaced by "Belarusian" in English (though Russian has not developed a new adjective). Some Belarusians object to the name "Belorussia", as an unwelcome reminder of the days under Russian and Soviet rule.<ref name='belorussia'> {{cite web|url=http://pravapis.org/art_belarusian_adjective.asp |title=Belarus: "Belarusian" and "Belarusan" the correct adjective forms |accessdate=2006-03-08 |last=Katkouski |first=Uladzimir |date=2003-02-03 |publisher=Pravapis.org }}</ref> Officially, the full name of the country is ''the Republic of Belarus'' (Рэспубліка Беларусь, Республика Беларусь, Respublika Byelarus'). {{Audio|Republic of Belarus.ogg|listen}}<ref>CIA World Factbook.

==Provinces and districts==
{{main|Administrative divisions of Belarus}}

[[Image:Belarus.geohive.png|thumb|250px|Provinces of Belarus]]
Belarus is divided into six [[province]]s ("[[voblast]]s"), named after the cities that serve as their administrative centers. The city of [[Minsk]], located in the Minsk province, has the special status of being a national subordinate, as it is not included in any voblast. Subdivision into ''voblasts'' was inherited from the Soviet era. Voblasts are further subdivided into ''[[raion]]s'' (commonly translated as "[[district]]s" or "regions"). Local legislative authorities (''raisovet'', "raion council") are elected by the raion's residents. Local executive authorities (''raion administration'') are appointed by higher executive authorities. In the same way, each voblast has its own legislative authority (''oblsovet''), elected by residents, and an executive authority (''voblast administration''), whose leader is appointed by the President.

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Belarus}}

[[Image:Belarus-Vaskowskae Reservoir.jpg|thumb|left|Vaskowskae reservoir]]
Belarus is [[landlocked]], relatively flat, and contains large tracts of [[marsh]]y land. Lakes and rivers punctuate the country. The largest marsh territory is [[Polesie]], which is among the largest marshes in Europe. There are 11,000 lakes in Belarus, but the majority of the lakes are smaller than 0.5&nbsp;square kilometer (120&nbsp;acres). Three major rivers run through the country; the [[Neman River]], the [[Pripyat River]], and the [[Dnepr River]]. Belarus' highest point is [[Dzyarzhynskaya Hara]] (Dzyarzhynsk Hill), 345&nbsp;meters (1,132&nbsp;ft), and its lowest point is on the Neman River, 90&nbsp;meters (295&nbsp;ft). Belarus is home, along with Poland, to the ''Belavezhskaya Pushcha'' (Белавежская пушча) or, by its Polish name, [[Białowieża Forest]], the only remaining, virgin part of the immense forest that once spread across the [[European Plain]].

The [[climate]] ranges from harsh winters (average January temperatures are in the range −8 to −2&nbsp;°C (18 to 28&nbsp;°F) to cool and moist summers (average temperature 15 to 20&nbsp;°C (59 to 68&nbsp;°F). On average, 15 to 30 centimeters (6 to 12&nbsp;inches) of snow falls in the country, mostly in the northeast. Belarus experiences an average [[rainfall]] of 600 to 700 millimeters (23.6 to 27.5&nbsp;inches) with over 70% of the rain falling during the warmer periods of the year.<ref>Library of Congress Country Studies [http://countrystudies.us/belarus/15.htm Belarus - Climate]. Retrieved [[July 13]], [[2007]].</ref> Due to the weather patterns, [[natural disaster]]s such as [[drought]]s and [[flood]]s occasionally occur in Belarus. Between the period of 1881 until 2005, the average temperature of Belarus rose 1 degree Celsius (34&nbsp;°F), with temperatures rising significantly during the winter and spring months. It has been projected that Belarus will face a 3 to 4 degree Celsius (34.5 to 39&nbsp;°F) rise in average temperatures when the twenty-first century ends.<ref>Belarus Tourist [http://www.belarustourist.minsk.by/belarus/climate.shtml Climate of Belarus].

Belarus has historically been a [[Russian Orthodox]] country, with minorities practicing [[Catholicism]], [[Judaism]], and other religions. Belarusians converted to the Russian Orthodox Church after Belarus was annexed by Russia after the Partitions of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Belarus' Roman Catholic minority, which makes up perhaps 10% of the country's population and is concentrated in the western part of the country, especially around [[Hrodna]], is made up of a mixture of Belarusians and the country's [[Polish people|Polish]] and [[Lithuanian people|Lithuanian]] minorities.

[[Image:Belarus dress.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Children in traditional dress]]

The traditional Belarusian dress originates from the [[Kievan Rus]]' period. Due to the cool climate, clothing, usually composed of [[flax]] or [[wool]], was designed to keep the body warm. They were decorated with ornate patterns which became influenced by the neighboring cultures: Poles, Lithuanians, Latvians, Russians, and other European nations. Each region of Belarus has developed a specific pattern used on their designs.<ref>Virtual Guide to Belarus [http://www.belarusguide.com/culture1/clothing/index.html Belarusian traditional clothing].

[[Cuisine of Belarus|Belarusian cuisine]] consists mostly of vegetables, meats and breads. The food staples of Belarus include pork, cabbages, potatoes and bread. Because of traditional cooking methods in the pre-Soviet era, foods are usually either slowly cooked or stewed. A typical Belarusian eats a very light breakfast and two hearty meals, with dinner being the largest meal of the day. Wheat and rye breads are both consumed in Belarus, but rye is more plentiful as conditions are too harsh for growing wheat. When greeting a guest or visitor, an offering of bread salt is presented to show hospitality.<ref>Canadian Citizenship and Immigration - [http://www.cp-pc.ca/english/belarus/eating.html Cultures Profile Project - Eating the Belarusian Way].

In the field of music, the first major composition by a Belarusian was the [[opera]] ''[[Faust]]'' by Radzivill. In the 17th century, Polish composer [[Stanislau Maniushka]] resided in Minsk, where he composed many operas and chamber music pieces. During his stay, he worked with Belarusian poet [[Vincent Dunin-Marcinkevich]] and created the opera [[Sialianka]] (Peasant Woman). At the end of the 19th century, the major cities in Belarus were forming their own opera and ballet companies. The ballet "Nightingale" by M. Kroshner was composed during the Soviet era. After the Great Patriotic War, the music focused on the hardships of the Belarusian people or on those who took up arms in defense of the homeland.<ref>Ministry of Foreign Affairs [http://www.mfa.gov.by/eng/index.php?d=belarus&id=28 Music].
