'''DevilDriver''' is a [[groove metal]] band from [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[California]]. [[Coal Chamber]] vocalist [[Dez Fafara]] was not happy with the direction Coal Chamber was going in musically, and met musicians who had a similar music interest at a barbecue and bar. Fafara, guitarists [[Evan Pitts]] and [[Jeff Kendrick]], bassist [[Jon Miller (guitarist)|Jon Miller]], and then-guitarist John Boecklin formed Deathride. Due to copyright issues and the name being taken by several bands, Deathride changed its name to DevilDriver, which refers to bells Italian witches used to drive evil forces away.

The band's [[DevilDriver (album)|self-titled]] album was not well received by some music critics. The primary writer of the album, Pitts, left the band and was replaced by [[Mike Spreitzer]]. Their second album, ''[[The Fury of Our Maker's Hand]]'' received a better reception with critics, and entered the [[Billboard 200]] at number 117. The band embarked on several tours including [[Ozzfest]] and a [[Guinness world record]] was attempted at the 2007 [[Download Festival]] for the "largest [[circle pit]]".

==Biography==

The band was originally known as Deathride, but due to their overwhelmingly bad reception, they changed their name in a hope to increase popularity. which was changed as Fafara felt there were too many bands with that name; a band in Norfolk, Virginia, and a bicycle racing team.<ref name="Interview with Dez Farfara of DevilDriver">{{cite web

Fafara's wife had a book by Italian witchcraft author [[Raven Grimassi]] on [[Stregheria]], and came across the term 'devil driver'. The term 'devil driver' refers to bells Italian witches used to drive evil forces away. Fafara thought it was appropriate because it sounded "evil", and thought the term "suits his life".<ref name="TARTAREAN DESIRE WEBZINE">{{cite web

===''The Fury of Our Maker's Hand'' (2005–2006)===
The band returned to the studio in 2005 to record their follow-up to ''DevilDriver''. The album was produced at Sonic Ranch Studios, a {{convert|1400|acre|km2|sing=on}} [[pecan]] ranch, {{convert|200|mi|km}} away from [[El Paso, Texas]]. The band members wanted to be isolated when recording the album so they could solely focus on the music as friends, family, managers and girlfriends would constantly interrupt. Roughly 30 songs were written which were narrowed down to 15 by the band. The 15 songs were then played for producer [[Colin Richardson]] who wanted to begin [[tracker|tracking]] immediately.

The name of the album was thought of by Fafara who believed that ''[[The Fury of Our Maker's Hand]]'' refers to the "storm" his life has been the past 10 years, "You have your maker's hand and I have my maker's hand and we both living in our fury, the fury of our maker's hand. It explains my life".<ref name ="Soundscan report"/> The album was released on [[June 28]], [[2005]] and debuted on the [[Billboard 200]] chart at number 117, with sales of 10,402 in its first week.<ref name ="Soundscan report">[http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=38915 "Soundscan report DevilDriver"] Blabbermouth.net, ([[July 6]], [[2005]]).

Cox now directs music videos for bands such as [[Linkin Park]] and [[Korn]].<ref name="DevilDriver Vocalist Dez Fafara"/> The first song to be previewed was "Horn of Betrayal" which debuted on Sirius Satellite's Hard Attack channel on [[May 16]].

DevilDriver promoted the album at the 2007 [[Download Festival]] at [[Donington]] alongside headliners Linkin Park, [[Iron Maiden]], and [[My Chemical Romance]]. A [[Guinness world record]] was attempted by the band for the "largest circle pit" at the festival. Guinness responded to the query and denied the request stating they receive over 60,000 requests a year and there is no way to physically define where a circle pit starts and ends. They considered the proposal fully in the context of the subject area and stated that "our decision is final in this matter".<ref name="DEVILDRIVER Attempts 'Largest Circle Pit' GUINESS Record; Video Available ">{{cite web
