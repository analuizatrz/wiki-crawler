'''Ernest Raymond Herbert Toshack''' ([[8 December]] [[1914]]&ndash;[[11 May]] [[2003]]) was an [[Australia]]n [[cricketer]] who played in 12 [[Test cricket|Tests]] from 1946 to 1948. A left arm [[fast bowling|medium paced]] [[bowling (cricket)|bowler]] who was known for his accuracy and stamina in his application of [[leg theory]], Toshack was best known for being as member of [[Don Bradman]]'s ''Invincibles'' that [[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|toured England in 1948]] without incurring a defeat, where he reinforced Australia's [[cricket_ball#Condition_of_a_cricket_ball|new ball attack]] of [[Ray Lindwall]] and [[Keith Miller]]. 

Born in 1914, Toshack overcame many obstacles to reach international level cricket. He was orphaned as an infant, and his early cricket career was hindered because of financial difficulties caused by the [[Great Depression in Australia|Great Depression]]. The [[Second World War]] prevented Toshack from competing at [[first-class cricket|first-class level]] until he was into his thirties. In 1945&ndash;46, the first season of cricket after the end of the War, Toshack made his debut at first-class level and after only seven matches in the [[Sheffield Shield]] he was selected for Australia's tour of [[New Zealand]]. In [[Wellington]], he opened the bowling in a match that was retrospectively classed as an official Test match. Toshack became a regular member of the Australian team, playing in all of its Tests until the 1947&ndash;48 series against [[India national cricket team|India]]. He took his career-best match [[Bowling analysis|bowling figures]] of 11/31 in the First Test but began to suffer recurring knee injuries, and a medical board had to approve his selection for the 1948 England tour. Toshack played in the first four Tests before being injured. After a long convalescence, he attempted a comeback during Australia's 1949&ndash;50 season, but further injury forced him to retire. He was a parsimonious bowler, who was popular with crowds for his sense of humour.

== Early years ==

Born in the New South Wales bush town of [[Cobar, New South Wales|Cobar]] on [[December 8]], [[1914]], he was one of five children born to a stationmaster, but was orphaned at the age of six.<ref name="p5">Pollard (1990), p. 5.</ref><Ref name="tel"/> He was raised by relatives in Lyndhurst, in the northwest of the state. He played his early cricket and [[rugby league]] for [[Cowra]].<ref name="az">{{cite book| last = Cashman |first=Richard | year = 1997 | title = The A-Z of Australian cricketers|pages =pp. 299&ndash;300|isbn=0-19550-604-9}}</ref> In his youth he was also a [[Boxing|boxer]], and earned the nickname "Johnson" for his dark-skinned resemblance to American black heavyweight champion [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]]. In the mid 1930s, he made brief appearances for the State Colts and [[11 (number)#in sports|2nd XI]],<ref name="wisden">{{cite web| title= Players and Officials - Ernie Toshack | url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/7960.html | publisher=[[Wisden]]| accessdate=2007-05-23}}</ref> and played cricket against the likes of [[Stan McCabe]],<ref name="p5"/> an inductee into the [[Australian Cricket Hall of Fame]].<ref name ="mc">{{cite web|first= Gideon| last = Haigh| authorlink = Gideon Haigh| url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/australia/content/player/6540.html |title= Players and Officials - Stan McCabe|accessdate=2007-01-12|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}</ref> His cricket aspirations, already hindered due to economic difficulties caused by the [[Great Depression in Australia|Great Depression]] were further interrupted when he was wheelchair-bound for months after a ruptured appendix in 1938.<ref name="az"/> He was not allowed to enlist in the [[Australian Defence Force]] during the [[Second World War]]and worked at [[Lithgow, New South Wales|Lithgow]]'s Small Arms factory, in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]] west of Sydney. Only at the end of the war, aged 30 did he go to Sydney. At the time, he was a [[fast bowling#Categorisation of fast bowling|medium-fast]] left-arm bowler and approached [[Petersham, New South Wales|Petersham]]&mdash;since Toshack lived in their locality, they had the right to register him ahead of other clubs. They did not select Toshack, so he joined Marrickville in [[Sydney Grade Cricket]], starting in the [[Division (sport)|third grade team]] in 1944&ndash;45.<ref name="wisden"/> Within two matches, he rose to first grade.<ref name="az"/>

== First-class and Test debut ==

Upon the resumption of first-class cricket in 1945&ndash;46, he made his debut for [[New South Wales Blues|New South Wales]] against [[Queensland Bulls|Queensland]] as an opening bowler aged almost 31, and was quickly among the [[Wicket#Dismissing_a_batsman|wickets]]. He took four [[wicket]]s for the loss of 69 runs (4/69) in his first innings as his team fell to a [[result (cricket)|six wicket loss]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aus.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1940S/1945-46/AUS_LOCAL/QLD_NSW_23-27NOV1945.html|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|accessdate=2007-11-28|title=Queensland vs New South Wales at Brisbane, November 23-27, 1945}}</ref> At the end of the season in  March 1946, Toshack had taken 35 wickets in seven first-class matches, at an [[bowling average|average]] of 18.82, making him the second highest wicket-taker behind [[George Tribe]] with 40. He performed consistently and his innings best was 4/30.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aus.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1940S/1945-46/AUS_LOCAL/STATS/FC_1945-46_BOWL_MOST_WKTS.html|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|accessdate=2007-11-28|title=Australian First-Class Season 1945/46: Bowling - Most Wickets}}</ref> Toshack was selected for a tour of [[New Zealand]] and found himself opening the bowling for Australia with fellow debutant [[Ray Lindwall]] in a match at [[Wellington]] which was retrospectively recognised as a Test two years later.<ref name="az"/> The eight years since Australia's last Test saw a new post-war generation of international cricketers make their debut.

Toshack took three further wickets to end with innings figures of 4/12. Toshack did not bat as Australia made 8/198. New Zealand were then bowled out in their second innings for 54, with Toshack taking 2/6 as Australia took an innings victory.<Ref>Pollard (1988), p. 375.</ref>  He dismissed [[Eric Tindill]] and [[Ces Burke]] in both innings.<ref name="ds">{{cite web|url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/62661.html|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|accessdate=2007-11-28|title=Only Test:New Zealand vs Australia at Wellington, March 29-30, 1946}}</ref> The performance ensured that Toshack would become an integral part of Australia’s attack for the next three years.<ref name="wisden"/><ref name="obit"/>

[[Image:ToshackPortrait.jpg|left|125px|thumb|Ernie Toshack]]
Toshack was selected to make his [[the Ashes|Ashes]] debut against the [[England cricket team]] in the First Test of the 1946&ndash;47 home series in [[Brisbane]].<Ref name="testlist"/> With the emergence of leading [[all rounder]] [[Keith Miller]], Toshack was relegated to first change bowler as Miller began his much celebrated partnership with Lindwall.<ref name="Ash1"/> Toshack was unbeaten on one in his first innings with the bat when Australia were bowled out for 645 on the third day.<Ref name="Ash1"/><ref name="p381">Pollard (1988), p. 381.</ref> 
On a [[sticky wicket]], Toshack initially struggled, bowling his characteristic leg stump line. England managed to amass 117 runs for the loss of five wickets (5/117) at the end of the fourth day despite many interruptions caused by rain.<ref name="Ash1"/> [[Norman Yardley]] and captain [[Wally Hammond]] had defied the Australian bowlers since coming together at 5/66.<ref name="Ash1"/> On the fifth and final morning, captain [[Don Bradman]] advised him to pitch straighter and at a slower pace.<ref name="p381"/><Ref name="az"/><Ref name="wisden"/><ref name="obit"/> Having started the day wicketless, Toshack [[dismissal (cricket)|dismissed]] Yardley and Hammond in the space of 13 runs to break the English resistance and finished with an economical 3/17 from 17 [[over (cricket)|overs]] as England were bowled out for 141.<ref name="Ash1"/> Bradman enforced the follow-on, and with Lindwall indisposed,<ref name="p381"/> Toshack took the new ball with Miller. He continued where he finished in the first innings, taking four of the first six wickets as the English top order were reduced to 6/65. He ended the match with 6/82 as England were bowled out twice in a day to lose by an innings and 332 runs.<ref name="wisden"/><ref name="obit"/><Ref name="Ash1">{{cite web| url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/62665.html| publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|accessdate=2007-11-28|title=1st Test:Australia vs England at Brisbane, Nov 29- Dec 4, 1946}}</ref> The remaining four Tests were less successful: only in one innings did he take more than one wicket. In the Second Test, the pitch favoured [[spin bowling]] and Toshack only bowled 13 overs without taking a wicket as Australia claimed another innings victory. He took match figures of 2/127 before returning to form in the Fourth Test in Adelaide Test, where he took 5/66 from a long spell of 66 eight ball overs in extreme heat.<ref name="wisden"/><ref name="obit">{{cite web| title= Obituary, 2004 - Ernie Toshack | url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/155391.html |year=2004 | publisher=[[Wisden]]| accessdate=2007-05-23}}</ref>  Toshack finished the series with 17 wickets at a [[bowling average]] of 25.71.<ref name="testlist">{{cite web| title= Statsguru - ERH Toshack - Tests - Innings by innings list | url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/guru?sdb=player;playerid=745;class=testplayer;filter=basic;team=0;opposition=0;notopposition=0;season=0;homeaway=0;continent=0;country=0;notcountry=0;groundid=0;startdefault=1946-03-29;start=1946-03-29;enddefault=1948-07-27;end=1948-07-27;tourneyid=0;finals=0;daynight=0;toss=0;scheduledovers=0;scheduleddays=0;innings=0;result=0;followon=0;seriesresult=0;captain=0;keeper=0;dnp=0;recent=;viewtype=aro_list;runslow=;runshigh=;batposition=0;dismissal=0;bowposition=0;ballslow=;ballshigh=;bpof=0;overslow=;overshigh=;conclow=;conchigh=;wicketslow=;wicketshigh=;dismissalslow=;dismissalshigh=;caughtlow=;caughthigh=;caughttype=0;stumpedlow=;stumpedhigh=;csearch=;submit=1;.cgifields=viewtype | publisher=[[Cricinfo]]| accessdate=2007-11-28}}</ref><ref>Pollard (1988), p. 389.</ref> His first-class season was not a productive as in his debut year; he took 33 wickets at an average of 30.93 in eleven matches, making him the sixth highest wicket-taker for the season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aus.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1940S/1946-47/AUS_LOCAL/STATS/FC_1946-47_BOWL_MOST_WKTS.html|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|accessdate=2007-11-28|title=Australian First-Class Season 1946/47: Bowling - Most Wickets}}</ref>

The following 1947&ndash;48 season, in the First Test against [[Indian cricket team|India]] at [[Brisbane]] on a wet pitch,<ref name="p393"/> Toshack took ten wickets for the only time in his Test career.<ref name="testlist"/> In reply to Australia's 382, India had been reduced to 5/23 by Lindwall, Miller and [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]] before [[Vijay Hazare]] and captain [[Lala Amarnath]] took the score to 53 without further loss, prompting Toshack's introduction into the attack. He dismissed both to end with 5/2 in 19 balls as India were bowled out after adding only five further runs.<ref name="ind1"/><ref name="p393">Pollard (1988), p. 393.</ref> Bradman enforced the [[follow on]] and India reached 1/27 before a spell of 6/29 from Toshack reduced them to 8/89.

== ''Invincibles'' tour ==
{{seealso|Australian cricket team in England in 1948}}
[[Image:Toshack&Hamence.jpg|right|thumb|Toshack (right) pictured with Invincibles teammate [[Ron Hamence]]]]
By the end of the Indian series, knee injuries had begun to hamper Toshack, and he only made the trip to England for the 1948 tour on a 3&ndash;2 majority vote by a medical team,<ref name="obit"/> despite being one of the first selected by the board. Two Melbourne doctors ruled him unfit, but three specialists from his home state presented a more optimistic outlook that allowed him to tour.<Ref name="p6"/> The tour was to guarantee him immortality as a member of Bradman's ''[[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|Invincibles]]''. He grew tired of signing autographs during the voyage, and entrusted a friend with the task. As a result,  there are still sheets circulating with his name mis-spelt as ''Toshak''.<Ref name="wisden"/> Between the new-ball attacks of Lindwall, [[Keith Miller]] and Johnston every 55 overs, Toshack played the role of stifling England's scoring. In one match against [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]], his 17 overs yielded only three scoring shots. He finished the match bowling 32 overs while conceding 29&nbsp;runs.<ref name="wisden"/> At [[Bramall Lane]], [[Sheffield]], he recorded the best innings analysis of his first-class career, taking 7/81 from 40 consecutive overs, <ref name="p11">Pollard (1990), p. 11.</ref> bemusing the [[Yorkshire]] spectators with the his accent and distinctive "Ow Wizz Ee" [[appeal (cricket)|appealing]]. Bradman considered his 6/51 against the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] at [[Lord's Cricket Ground|Lord's]] as the best performance of all.<ref name="wisden"/><ref name="obit"/>
[[Image:Bsb48052.jpg|Toshack, standing at the left of the middle row, along with his ''Invincibles'' teammates|200px|thumb|left]]
Toshack's performance in the First Test at [[Trent Bridge]] was a quiet one, taking a wicket in each innings.<ref name="testlist"/> He was involved in an aggressive final wicket partnership of 32 with Johnston, scoring 19&nbsp;runs, his best at Test level to date in just 18&nbsp;minutes. Toshack's best Test performance was his 5/40 in the second innings of the Second Test at Lord’s when Miller was unable to bowl after being injured,<Ref name="obit"/> including the wickets of [[Cyril Washbrook]] and [[John Edrich]]. During this performance, he employed two short legs and a silly mid-off.<ref name="p11"/> He had a moderately successful Third Test, taking figures of 3/101 in the only Test that Australia did not win. His knee injury flared again in the Fourth Test after taking an ineffective 1/112 in the first innings and he was taken to [[London]] for cartilage surgery, ending his tour and his Test career.<ref name="testlist"/> An inept batsman with an [[batting average|average]] of 5.78 in first-class fixtures, Toshack managed a Test average of 51 on the 1948 tour after being out only once, behind only [[Arthur Morris]], [[Sid Barnes]], Bradman and [[Neil Harvey]]. The unbeaten 20 he managed in the Lord's Test was his best first-class score, made in an uninhibited tenth-wicket stand with Johnston.<ref name="wisden"/><ref name="obit"/> Due to the fragility of his knee, Toshack was used sparingly in the tour games, playing in only six of the 29 non Test matches on the tour.<ref>Pollard (1990), p. 19.</ref>

The back injury prevented Toshack from playing during the 1948&ndash;1949 Australian domestic season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aus.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1940S/1948-49/AUS_LOCAL/STATS/FC_1948-49_BOWL_MOST_WKTS.html|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|accessdate=2007-11-28|title=Australian First-Class Season 1948/49: Bowling - Most Wickets}}</ref> At the start of the 1949&ndash;50 season, after he took nine wickets in a Shield match in Brisbane, the injury resurfaced and forced him to retire from first-class cricket. Toshack subsequently joined a firm of builders and spent 25 years as a foreman and supervisor on construction sites around Sydney.<ref name="az"/> He also wrote about cricket and enjoyed cultivating his vegetable garden. Toshack died on [[11 May]] [[2003]]. He was survived by a wife Cathleen Hogan, whom he married in 1939, their only daughter, three granddaughters and two great-granddaughters.<ref name="wisden"/><ref name="obit"/><Ref name="tel">{{cite news| title=Ernie Toshack |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/05/13/db1302.xml|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | date=[[2003-05-13]] |accessdate=2008-03-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| title=Australia Test bowler Toshack passes away |date=[[2003-05-12]] |accessdate=2008-03-18 |publisher =[[Rediff]] |url=http://in.rediff.com/cricket/2003/may/12roll.htm}}</ref>

Bowling primarily from over the wicket, his accuracy, [[slower ball|changes of pace]], and movement in both directions, coupled with a [[leg theory|leg stump line]] to a packed leg-side field, made scoring off him difficult.<ref name="az"/><ref name="tel"/> He achieved his success in a manner not dissimilar to [[Derek Underwood]] a generation later. His accuracy and stamina allowed [[Ray Lindwall]] and [[Keith Miller]], one of Australia’s finest fast bowling pairs of all time, to draw breath between short and incisive bursts of pace and [[swing bowling|swing]].<ref name="az"/><ref name="wisden"/><ref name="obit"/><ref name="tel"/> Standing {{convert|6|ft|2|in|cm|0}}, he was particularly effective on sticky wickets, reducing his speed to slow medium pace and using a repertoire of [[off cutter]]s, [[inswinger]]s, [[outswinger]]s and [[leg break]]s. Bowling a leg-stump line from over the wicket with a leg side cordon of two [[Fielding_%28cricket%29#Fielding_position_names_and_locations|short legs]] and a [[Fielding_%28cricket%29#Fielding_position_names_and_locations|silly mid-on]], he was described by Bradman as "unique in every way".<ref name="wisden"/><ref name="obit"/> He usually bowled with four men on the [[off side]] including a [[Fielding_%28cricket%29#Fielding_position_names_and_locations|slip]], and five on the leg.<Ref name="p5"/> When the pitch was wet, he moved a further man to the [[leg side|on side]] to field at [[Fielding_%28cricket%29#Fielding_position_names_and_locations|leg slip]].<Ref name="p6">Pollard (1990), p. 6.</ref>

Nicknamed the "Black Prince", Toshack's looks and sense of humour made him a crowd favourite, as did his theatrical [[appeal (cricket)|appeal]]ing. His sense of fun was often on show. While on tour, he would often wear a bowler hat, grab a furled umbrella, and place a cigar in his mouth, parodying an Englishman.<ref name="wisden"/><ref name="obit"/><Ref name="tel"/>
