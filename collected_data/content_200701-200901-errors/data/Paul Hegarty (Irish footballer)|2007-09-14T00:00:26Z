On [[15 December]], [[2006]] Hegarty announced that he would be moving on from his role as assistant manager at Derry due to difficulties in relation to [[Pat Fenlon|Pat Fenlon's]] new training schedules for the 2007 season. With the managerial slot left empty at [[Finn Harps]] since [[Anthony Gorman|Anthony Gorman's]] departure, Hegarty looked like the favourite to take the role at [[Finn Park]].[http://www.derryjournal.com/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=3422&ArticleID=1932833] On [[20 December]], 2006 Hegarty was named the new boss at [[Finn Harps]] after signing a two-year deal with the club.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/irish/6196141.stm]
