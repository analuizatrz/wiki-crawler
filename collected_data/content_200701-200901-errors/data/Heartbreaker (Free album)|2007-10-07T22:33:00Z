'''''Heartbreaker''''' is the seventh and final album by [[England|English]] [[rock (music)|rock]] group [[Free (band)|Free]], that provided them with one of their most successful singles, "Wishing Well". It was recorded in late 1972 after [[bassist]] [[Andy Fraser]] had left the band and while [[guitarist]] [[Paul Kossoff]] was ailing from an addiction to [[Mandrax]] (contemporary photographs show him looking gaunt and emaciated), and features a different line up to previous albums: [[Tetsu Yamauchi]] was brought in to replace Fraser, while [[John Bundrick|John "Rabbit" Bundrick]] became the band's keyboard player to compensate for the increasingly unreliable Kossoff (singer [[Paul Rodgers]] played keyboards on the previous album ''[[Free at Last (Free album)|Free at Last]]'', but was nowhere near as proficient a player as Bundrick). Both Yamauchi and Bundrick had played with Kossoff and [[drummer]] [[Simon Kirke]] on the album [[Kossoff, Kirke, Tetsu & Rabbit (album)|Kossoff, Kirke, Tetsu & Rabbit]] during that period in late 1971 where the band had broken up. Also, several other musicians were used on the album. This, plus the fact that the album was co-produced by [[Andy Johns]] as well as Free, resulted in the most professional and well-produced album for some time, and also one that is considerably mellower and more mature than many previous efforts. Indeed, there are almost no points of comparison between this and their debut album ''[[Tons of Sobs]]'' in 1968.

==Line up==
*Paul Rodgers - vocals
*Paul Kossoff - guitar
*John "Rabbit" Bundrick - keyboards
*Tetsu Yamauchi - bass
*Simon Kirke - drums
*"Snuffy" Walden - guitar on "Easy on My Soul"
*[[Rebop Kwaku Baah]] - congas on "Wishing Well"

NOTE: The album lists Kossoff as an additional musician (due to exessive drug problems the band had hired a session musician); since this is technically not correct, the listing above has been amended slightly.

==Recording==
One immediate effect of Fraser's departure was the loss of the Fraser/Rodgers songwriting partnership that had hitherto provided the bulk of the band's catalogue. Hence many of the songs were written solely by Rodgers, although some are credited to the entire band as a symbolic gesture (including the single "Wishing Well"). Bundrick wrote two of the album's eight tracks.

Yamauchi had only a very minor influence in the band; the [[Japanese people|Japanese]] bassist was unfamiliar with the English language and in any case was unwilling to jeopardise playing in a relatively well-known and well-regarded British band. Bundrick, on the other hand, was more volatile and frequently clashed with Rodgers just as Fraser had done: they even once had a [[Assault|fist-fight]] in a [[London]] [[restaurant]]. 

Meanwhile, Kossoff was extremely resentful of [[session musician]]s brought in periodically to replace him when the other band members' patience began to break. This exacerbated even further his problems, but on those occasions where recording went well he produced some notable work; he is in fact far more prominent on this album than on the previous one. 

[[Island Records]] boss [[Chris Blackwell]] disliked the band's initial mix of the album and drafted regular engineer Andy Johns to solve the problem; in January 1973 the album was ready for release.
==Reception==
The album was by Free's standards a huge success, becoming their third top-ten album in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] (reaching #9); it reached #47 in [[North America|America]], which was also a considerable success for the band. Also, the single release "Wishing Well" became their third-most successful single, reaching #7. It is widely regarded as one of their definitive songs.

Despite the success of the album and impending tour of America, it finally became apparent that the band had passed the point of no return. Kossoff being credited as an additional musician came as a shock to the entire band. Kossoff spiralled to his lowest ebb and was unable to go to America; he was replaced with [[Wendell Richardson]] from [[Osibisa]]. He proved to be a poor choice, and eventually the band finally gave up. Rodgers and Kirke formed [[Bad Company]] with [[Mick Ralphs]] (formerly of [[Mott the Hoople]]) and [[Boz Burrell]] (formerly of [[King Crimson]]); Yamauchi joined [[the Faces]]; Bundrick became a session musician and eventually became a regular [[keyboard instrument|keyboard]] player with [[the Who]]; Kossoff tried to form his own band [[Back Street Crawler]]. After two unsuccessful albums, the guitarist died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on board an [[fixed-wing aircraft|aeroplane]] on the [[19 March]] [[1976]], at the age of 25.
==Track listing==
===Original tracks===
# "Wishing Well (Rodgers/Kirke/Yamauchi/Kossoff/Bundrick) 3.43
#*One of Free's most popular and enduring tracks, this is a loud and fast riff-driven rock song released as a single in December 1972. There are conflicting accounts of Kossoff's involvement in the song, and he is not listed as playing on it in the album credits. Like many late-period Free songs it concerns emotional distress told in a detached [[grammatical person|second-person]], leading many to believe it was written about Kossoff - Rodgers, the writer of the song, denies this. It is the only true rock song on the album; ironically, even though it is probably the album's most popular track it is probably its least representative. (At his own website Bundrick says he wrote the music for the 'peaceful' "middle 8" section). 
# "Come Together In The Morning (Rodgers) 4.38
#*A slow and keyboard-driven song, this is far more likely to be about Kossoff than the previous song.  It contains one of his best-regarded [[guitar solo]]s, in which he fed his guitar through a [[Leslie speaker]] as [[Jimi Hendrix]] had done in "Little Wing" from ''[[Axis: Bold as Love]]'' (1967).
# "Travellin' in Style (Rodgers/Kirke/Yamauchi/Kossoff/Bundrick) 4.01
#*A jaunty acoustic song that is considerably more lighthearted than most Free songs of the period, the song suggests an optimism at odds with what was occurring in the band at the time.
# "Heartbreaker" (Rodgers) 6.12
#*The title track of the album is a passionate song with [[blues]] and [[progressive rock]] influences, this is another popular track and often appears on compilation albums, sometimes in place of "Wishing Well". It is the longest Free song apart from "[[Goin' Down Slow]]" on ''Tons of Sobs''; because of this it was omitted from [[CD]] reissue of the compilation album ''[[The Free Story]]'' (1974), meaning that that album now features no tracks from ''[[Heartbreaker (album)|Heartbreaker]]''.
# "Muddy Water" (Bundrick) 4.15
#*The first of Bundrick's compositions from the album, this is a slow piano-led ballad about lost love.
# "Common Mortal Man" (Bundrick) 4.06
#*Bundrick's second composition, this is more of a progressive rock song consisting of considerably more esoteric, existential subject matter than "Muddy Water". It is driven by an electric [[organ (music)|organ]] rather than piano.
# "Easy on My Soul" (Rodgers) 3.44
#*A slow, piano-driven song that lacks a clearly defined lyrical structure: it has few lyrics, repeated often. This song relies on delivery rather than its content. When asked what inspired the song, Rodgers replied "No one in particular inspired "Easy on My Soul", it is a message of love."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allrightnow.com/fws/paulrodgers_chat_transcript_09dec01.htm|title=Super Chat with Paul Rodgers|date=2001-12-09|accessdate=2007-02-23}}</ref>
# "Seven Angels" (Rodgers) 5.03
#*The dramatic final track on the album is uniquely guitar driven and features Biblical lyrics, specifically dealing with the [[Book of Revelation]]. As such it makes for an appropriate coda to the band's final album, although it is debatable whether Rodgers wrote it with the band's demise in mind.

===Extra tracks===
# "Wishing Well" (US mix) (Rodgers/Kirke/Yamauchi/Kossoff/Bundrick) 3.39
#*This an alternative mix for a single release in America, which failed. It is less professionally produced than the album version but features a much more prominent guitar solo and noticeable [[List of Caribbean drums|congo drum]] playing from Rebop Kwaku Baah.
# "Let Me Show You" (Rodgers/Kirke/Yamauchi/Kossoff/Bundrick) 3.01
#*The [[B-side]] to "Wishing Well", this is a lightweight [[soul music|soul]] song dealing with romantic love, an increasingly rare topic for the band.
# "Muddy Water" (Budrick) 4.15
#*This is an early version of the album track, before overdubs were added and featuring a different vocal performance from Rodgers.
# "Hand Me Down / Turn Me Round" (Bundrick) 3.19
#*Another Bundrick composition, this soulful but brooding song was written to be included on the album but discarded at an early stage. This features Bundrick singing a guide vocal, as Rodgers never recorded a vocal take.
# "Heartbreaker" (Rodgers) (Rehearsal version) 5.40
#*This is a recorded performance of the album track during rehearsals for the band's tour of [[Japan]]. Kossoff was unable to tour, and this features Rodgers on guitar in his place.
# "Easy on My Soul" (Rodgers) (Rehearsal version) 8.42
#*This is a recorded performance of the album track during rehearsals for the band's tour of Japan. It features Rodgers on [[pianola]] and Bundrick on [[grand piano]]; the song was never tightly structured and this is little more than a loose, extended jam session.
