'''Interstate 476''' is a {{convert|132.10|mi|km|2|sp=us|abbr=on}}-long<ref name="Blue Route" /><ref name="congestion" /><ref name="tollmileage" /> [[List of auxiliary Interstate Highways|auxiliary]] [[Interstate Highway]], designated between [[Interstate 95 in Pennsylvania|Interstate 95]] near [[Chester, Pennsylvania]] and [[Interstate 81]] near [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], serves as the primary north-south Interstate corridor through eastern [[Pennsylvania]]. It consists of both the 21.5&nbsp;mile<ref name="congestion" /> '''Mid-County Expressway''', locally referred to as the "'''Blue Route'''", through the suburban [[Philadelphia]] counties of [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware]] and [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery]], and the 110.6&nbsp;mile<ref name="tollmileage" /> '''Northeast Extension''' of the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] connecting the [[Delaware Valley|Philadelphia metropolitan area]] with the [[Lehigh Valley]], the [[Poconos]], and the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]]-[[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]] metropolitan area.

While proposed as early as [[1929]], the construction of the Mid-County Expressway through Delaware County, Pennsylvania was not completed until [[1991]] due to massive community and environmental opposition during the [[freeway revolts]] of the 1960s and 1970s, leading ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' to dub it "the most costly, most bitterly opposed highway in Pennsylvania history."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/byday/fhbd1219.htm|title=FHWA By Day - December 19|accessdate=2007-03-07}}</ref>

Following the completion of the Mid-County Expressway, in [[1996]] the Interstate 476 designation was extended to include the entire length of the existing Northeast Extension. Since the extension, I-476 has been the longest auxiliary [[Interstate highway]] in the [[United States]].

The portion of Interstate 476 between [[Interstate 95 in Pennsylvania|Interstate 95]] and [[Interstate 276]], running north-south through [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania]], is officially known as the '''Mid-County Expressway''' and the '''Veterans Memorial Highway''', as well as by its ubiquitous nickname, the '''Blue Route'''. The road begins at Interstate 95 near the southwest [[Philadelphia]] suburb of [[Chester, Pennsylvania|Chester]], near [[Philadelphia International Airport]].<ref name="exit 1" />

Heading north, the road immediately narrows to a four-lane parkway north of Exit 1, a reduced design built due to local environmental concerns.<ref name="parkway">{{cite web|url=http://www.phillyroads.com/roads/blue-route/img14.gif|title=Reducing Impacts Through Improved Highway Section|work=Overview of Departmental Recommendations on the Blue Route (I-476)|publisher=[[Pennsylvania Department of Transportation]]|year=1984|accessdate=2007-06-11}}</ref> The route winds through the western [[Philadelphia]] suburbs of [[Wallingford, Pennsylvania|Wallingford]], [[Swarthmore, Pennsylvania|Swarthmore]], and [[Springfield, Pennsylvania|Springfield]], meeting [[U.S. Route 1]] at a massive [[three-level diamond interchange]].<ref name="exit 5">{{cite web|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?client=firefox-a&ie=UTF8&oe=UTF-8&hl=en&channel=s&q=&om=1&ll=39.937645,-75.362628&spn=0.005594,0.010042&t=h&z=17|title=Map/Satellite image of Exit 5|accessdate=2007-06-11|work=Google}}</ref>

=== Northeast Extension ===
[[Image:I-476 Exit 44.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Approaching exit 44 ([[Pennsylvania Route 663|PA 663]]).]]
Beyond the toll barrier, Interstate 476 enters the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] system, interchanging with [[Interstate 276]] and continuing north as the '''Northeast Extension''' of the Pennsylvania Turnpike. The route continues through the Philadelphia suburbs, past [[Lansdale, Pennsylvania|Lansdale]] and [[Quakertown, Pennsylvania|Quakertown]], and into the [[Lehigh Valley]] metropolitan area. It interchanges with [[U.S. Route 22]] near [[Allentown]], which also offers an indirect connection to [[Pennsylvania Route 309]] and [[Interstate 78]].<ref name="lv interchange">{{cite web|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?client=firefox-a&ie=UTF8&oe=UTF-8&hl=en&channel=s&q=&om=1&ll=40.592187,-75.562248&spn=0.04432,0.080338&z=14|title=I-476 at the Lehigh Valley interchange|accessdate=2007-06-11|work=Google}}</ref>

North of Allentown, the route enters the [[Poconos]], tunneling underneath [[Blue Mountain (Pennsylvania)|Blue Mountain]], and meeting [[U.S. Route 209]] near [[Lehighton, Pennsylvania|Lehighton]]. Continuing through the mountains, it cuts through [[Hickory Run State Park]], interchanging with [[Interstate 80]] on the perimeter on its way to the end of the toll ticket system at [[Bear Creek, Pennsylvania]].

North of the toll barrier, the route meets [[Pennsylvania Route 115]], which provides access to nearby [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]]. Near [[Pittston, Pennsylvania|Pittston]], an interchange provides an indirect connection to [[Interstate 81]] through [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]]. The route then crosses the [[Wyoming Valley]] and skirts around Scranton, with an exit to local Keyser Avenue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?client=firefox-a&ie=UTF8&oe=UTF-8&hl=en&channel=s&q=&om=1&ll=40.592187,-75.562248&spn=0.04432,0.080338&z=14|title=I-476 around Scranton|accessdate=2007-06-11|work=Google}}</ref> North of Scranton, the route comes to an abrupt end at a hairpin curve in [[Clarks Summit, Pennsylvania|Clarks Summit]], with connections to [[Interstate 81]], [[U.S. Route 6]] and [[U.S. Route 11]].<ref name="pamap"/>

== History ==
=== Mid-County Expressway ===
Originally planned as far back as 1929, the Mid-County Expressway was later proposed by the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission]] as the "Chester Extension" of the Pennsylvania Turnpike in 1954. After the advent of the [[Interstate Highway System]], the project was transferred to the [[Pennsylvania Department of Transportation|Pennsylvania Department of Highways]] to be built as part of the system, designating it first as '''Interstate 495''', and later as '''Interstate 480''', as I-76 was designated as I-80S at the time. The present-day I-476 designation was assigned on [[February 6]], [[1964]] when I-80S was renumbered as I-76.<ref name="Rambler">{{cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/i76.htm|title=Was I-76 Numbered to Honor Philadelphia for Independence Day, 1776?|publisher=Federal Highway Administration|date=[[2005]]-[[01-18]]|work=Ask the Rambler|accessdate=2007-06-06}}</ref>

[[Image:I-476 Blue Route Map.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A 1960 map of central [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware County]], oriented with east on top, outlining the proposed corridors of the Mid-County Expressway.]]The road received its ubiquitous nickname from a 1958 location report indicating various proposed geographic configurations of an expressway through [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware County]] with lines of various colors on a map. The "blue route" through the [[Crum Creek]] valley won out over other contenders, which included a more easterly "red route" and "yellow route" and a more westerly "green route".<ref name="history">{{cite web|url=http://www.476blueroute.com/history.htm|title=History of the Blue Route|accessdate=2007-06-11|work=I-476 Improvement Project|publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Transportation}}</ref>

As one of the most controversial Interstate Highways in Pennsylvania, construction of I-476 began in 1967, but was not completed until 1991 between MacDade Blvd.(Exit 1) and Interstate 76 (Exit 16), and until 1992 between Germantown Pike east/Chemical Rd.(Exit 19) and Interstate 276/Pennsylvania Turnpike (Exit 20), due to litigation between the [[Pennsylvania Department of Transportation]] and several communities in the road's path over environmental concerns. However, the section of Interstate 476(south end of I-476) between I-95 and MacDade Blvd.(Exit 1) was opened in 1987, but the signs refer to as "To MacDade Blvd" until 1991 when I-476/The Blue Route was opened between Exits 1 and 16. An agreement in 1985 led to many environmental compromises in the road's design, including a downsized four-lane design south of [[Pennsylvania Route 3]], [[ramp meter]]s, and federal scenic route status, prohibiting the erection of advertisement billboards along the entire freeway portion. While the redesigned highway was largely well-received, the constriction to four lanes has led to bottleneck conditions in the area, and many communities that originally opposed the road have now called for its widening.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asphaltinstitute.org/upload/Summer_1997.pdf|title=Asphalt: the Magazine of the Asphalt Institute, Summer 1997|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-03-07}}</ref>

The road is [[As of {{CURRENTYEAR}}|currently]] undergoing a complete rehabilitation project, including paving, bridge repair, and ramp maintenance of the entire length of the freeway between [[Interstate 95 in Pennsylvania|Interstate 95]] and the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.476blueroute.com/|title=I-476 Improvement Project|accessdate=2007-03-07}}</ref>

=== Northeast Extension ===
[[Image:PA-9.svg|50px|thumb|left|PA 9 (1955-1996)]]

The Northeast Extension of the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] system opened in stages from November 23, 1955 to November 7, 1957, and was originally designated '''Pennsylvania Route 9'''.<ref name="PennDOT 1989">{{cite map|publisher=Pennyslvania Department of Transportation|title=State Transportation, front|url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_pdf_files/Maps/Statewide/Historic_OTMs/1989fr.pdf|year=1989|accessdate=2007-06-11}}</ref>
[[Image:Lehigh Tunnel.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Lehigh Tunnel heading Southbound]]
The hairpin curve at the highway's northern terminus was designed to allow for expansion northward to the [[New York]] state line. However, as with the Chester Extension to the south, it was decided to incorporate this segment as part of [[Interstate 81]] following the advent of the Interstate system.<ref name="Lackawanna 1966">{{cite map|publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Transportation|title=Lackawanna County|url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_PDF_FILES/Maps/Type_10_GHS_Historical_Scans/Lackawanna_1966.pdf|edition=|year=1966|accessdate=2007-06-11|isbn=|id=}}</ref>

The highway includes a major, 4,461-foot tunnel through [[Blue Mountain (Pennsylvania)|Blue Mountain]] known as the [[Lehigh Tunnel]]. The tunnel was named as such so as not to cause confusion with the existing [[Blue Mountain Tunnel]] on the mainline. The tunnel was originally to be named for Turnpike Commission chairman Thomas J. Evans, but this was changed due to his [[July 25]], [[1967]] conviction for conspiracy to defraud the Turnpike Commission of $19 million. The Lehigh Tunnel was originally a two-lane tunnel in the manner of the mainline turnpike's original seven tunnels, until it was "twinned" in 1991.<ref name="turnpike history">{{cite web|url=http://www.476blueroute.com/history.htm|title=Turnpike History|work=About the PTC|publisher=Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission|accessdate=2007-03-07}}</ref>

In 1996, after the expansion of the Lehigh Tunnel and the completion of the I-276/I-476/PA 9 interchange, the I-476 designation was extended up the entire length of the Northeast Extension, replacing the PA 9 designation. This extension resulted in I-476 surpassing the 120&nbsp;mile [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 495]] in [[Massachusetts]] as the longest auxiliary Interstate highway.<ref name="fhwa table">{{cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/reports/routefinder/table2.cfm|title=Route Log and Finder List, table 2|publisher=Federal Highway Administration|date=[[2002]]-[[10-31]]|accessdate=2007-03-07}}</ref>

PennDOT is in the preliminary stages of planning the widening of the Northeast Extension from Mid-County to Lansdale from 4 lanes to 6.<ref name="neextwidening">{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc10.com/news/11605582/detail.html|title=Northeast Extension Plans Open To Public Monday Night|publisher=[[WCAU|NBC 10]]|accessdate=2007-04-19}}</ref>
