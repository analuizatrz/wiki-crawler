==Song==

'''''The Ordertaker''''' is a single by [[Philippines|Filipino]] Novelty Rock band Parokya ni Edgar.  It features Kamikazee.  It is a spoof of "[[Chop Suey!]]" and "[[Toxicity (song)|Toxicity]]" by System of a Down.  The melody is almost identical to that of Chop Suey!.  The song tells of a man who cannot order at a restaurant because he has no menu, and proceeds to list all of the different foods he would like to eat. ''The Ordertaker'' is a parody name of [[WWE Roster|WWE Wrestler]] [[Mark Calaway|The Undertaker]].

==Video==

The video starts with Chito Miranda(vocalist) in the clothes he wore in the music video Picha Pie. Joining them was their baby band - Kamikazee. It showed the two bands spoofing several wrestlers (like The Ordertaker, parody of [[Mark Calaway|The Undertaker]] and Adonis 3:16, parody of [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]]). Chito Miranda (who parodied [[The Ultimate Warrior]]) while Vinci Montaner is missing in action (he's in the wanted print ad).
