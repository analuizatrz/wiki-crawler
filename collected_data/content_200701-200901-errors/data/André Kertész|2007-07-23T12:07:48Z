'''André Kertész''' ([[July 2]], [[1894]] - [[September 28]], [[1985]]) born '''Andor Kertész''', was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-born photographer distinguished by his haunting photographic [[composition (visual arts)|composition]] and by his early efforts in developing the [[photo essay]]. In his lifetime, his then-unorthodox camera angles, which hindered [[prose]] descriptions of his works, prevented his work from gaining wider recognition, as well as his use of [[symbolism]] which also became unfashionable later in his life. However, Kertész is now recognized as one of the seminal figures of [[photojournalism]].<ref name="Kertész: His Life and Work">Borhan, Pierre. (2000). ''André Kertész: His Life and Work.''

==Biography==
===Early life and the Hungarian Period===
Born in [[Budapest]] to a middle-class family, André Kertész (then Andor Kertész and known as "Bandi" by his friends) had a relatively uncomplicated childhood. He was the second eldest of three brothers and was the son of Lipót Kertész, a bookseller, and his wife Ernesztin Hoffmann. When Lipót died in 1908 from [[tuberculosis]], Ernesztin was left widowed and without a source of inxome to care for her three children. Fortunately for Andor and his mother, Ernesztin's brother Lipót Hoffmann began to provide for the family in the absence of Lipót Kertész and was in many ways like a father to Andor and his two brothers. Soon after, Andor moved with his family to his uncle's country porperty in [[Szigetbecse]], where he became familiar with the laid back way of life and the beauty of nature.<ref name="Kertész: His Life and Work"/>

Lipót Hoffmann paid for Andor to go through business classes at the Academy of Commerce and made sure he was hired at the stock exchange in 1912 when he had completed his business studies. However, Andor is reported to have had little interest in the career. Instead, he was captivated by illustrated magazines and activities in the countryside such as fishing and swimming in the [[Danube]] which was a short distance from his uncle's property. After this first glimpse of photography in magazines, Andor was determined to become a photographer.<ref name="Kertész: His Life and Work"/>

When Andor had earned enough money, he immediately bought himself a camera. In his free time away from work, Andor began taking photographs of the local peasants, gypsies and landscape of the surrounding countryside, known as the ''puszta'' or Hungarian Plains. His first photograph is believed to be "Sleeping Boy, Budapest, 1912", although his photographs weren't published until a few years later whilst a member of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] army during [[World War I]]. Andor taught himself how to use a camera and even as early as 1914 (for example, "Eugene, 1914") his distinctive and mature style was already evident.<ref name="Kertész: His Life and Work"/>

===The Parisian Period===
Kertész emigrated to [[Paris]] in [[1925]], changed his first name from Andor, and became acquainted with members of the [[Dada]] movement. One of them dubbed him "Brother Seeing Eye", an allusion to a medieval monastery where all the monks were blind except one. His greatest journalistic collaboration was with the French editor and publisher [[Lucien Vogel]], who ran his photographs without explanatory prose. He created portraits of (among others) the painters [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]] and [[Marc Chagall]], the writer [[Colette]], and film-maker [[Sergei Eisenstein]]. In Paris he found critical and commercial success, and he was the first photographer in the world ever to have a one-man exhibition (1927){{Verify source|date=July 2007}}. He was a mentor to many famous names in photography; [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]] said, "We all owe something to Kertész".

===The American Period===
In [[1936]] Kertész and his wife Erzsebet (later altered to Elizabeth) went to the [[United States]] to escape the increasing tension in Europe that was leading to [[World War II]]. The [[Condé Nast Publications|Condé Nast Publishing]] empire had signed Kertész to a long-term contract, which meant he spent most of his time photographing famous homes for [[House & Garden (magazine)|House & Garden]] magazine. However, his personal photographic style did not mesh well with the straightforward fashion photography the American public (and magazines) expected. He continued to exhibit his individual work as best he could but his reputation slowly faded, and he became disillusioned.

His work did not appear in [[Edward Steichen|Steichen's]] famous [[The Family of Man]] show at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], but in [[1964]], soon after [[John Szarkowski]] became the photography director at the museum, Kertész had a solo show which relaunched his career and reputation. He caught the mood of the times and became something of an elder statesman to the photographers of the late [[1960s]] and early [[1970s]]. They had been seeking to validate a tradition of documentary/art photography through linking it back to the Paris photographers of the [[1920s]] and [[1930s]].

By the mid-1970s he was showing his work in galleries all over the world. He continued working very productively into old age, and was experimenting with instant [[Polaroid]] photography shortly before he died.
