'''Caesium fluoride''' ('''cesium fluoride''' in North America), is an ionic compound usually found as a hygroscopic white solid.  It is more soluble and more readily [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociated]] than [[sodium fluoride]] or [[potassium fluoride]].  CsF is commercially available&mdash;on a lab scale it costs around $50 per 100 g ([http://www.synquestlabs.com/catalog/catalog.html Synquest]), cheaper than RbF.  It is available in anhydrous form, and if water has been absorbed it is easy to dry by heating at 100 °[[celsius|C]] for two hours [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Vacuum ''in vacuo'']<sup>[3]</sup>.  It is therefore a useful, less [[hygroscopic]] alternative to [[tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride]] (TBAF) and [[TASF reagent|TAS-fluoride]] (TASF) when anhydrous "naked" [[fluoride]] [[ion]] is needed.  Like all soluble fluorides, it is mildly [[base (chemistry)|basic]].  Contact with [[acid]] should be avoided, as this forms highly toxic/corrosive [[hydrofluoric acid]].

== Chemical properties ==
Caesium fluoride reacts usually as a source of fluoride ion, F<sup>-</sup>.  It therefore undergoes all of the usual reactions associated with soluble fluorides such as potassium fluoride, for example:

2 CsF ([[aqueous|aq]])  +  [[calcium chloride|CaCl<sub>2</sub>]] (aq)  →  2 [[caesium chloride|CsCl]] (aq)  +   [[calcium fluoride|CaF<sub>2</sub>]] ([[solid|s]])

Being highly dissociated it is quite reactive as a fluoride source under anhydrous conditions too, and it will react with [[electron-deficient]] [[aryl chloride]]s to form [[aromatic|aryl]] fluorides ([[halex reaction]]).  Due to the strength of the [[silicon|Si]]–[[fluorine|F]] bond, fluoride ion is useful for desilylation reactions (removal of Si groups) in [[organic chemistry]]; caesium fluoride is an excellent source of anhydrous fluoride for such reactions (see uses below).  As with other soluble fluorides, CsF is moderately basic, due to the fact that [[hydrofluoric acid|HF]] is a weak acid.  The low [[nucleophile|nucleophilicity]] of fluoride means it can be a useful base in organic chemistry (see uses below).

== Preparation ==
Caesium fluoride may be prepared by the action of [[hydrofluoric acid]] on [[caesium hydroxide]] or [[caesium carbonate]], followed by removal of water.

== Uses ==
Caesium fluoride is a useful base in [[organic chemistry]], due the fact that fluoride [[ion]] is largely unreactive as a [[nucleophile]].  It is reported that CsF gives higher yields in [[Knoevenagel condensation]] reactions than [[potassium fluoride|KF]] or [[sodium fluoride|NaF]]<sup>[4]</sup>.

Removal of silicon groups (desilylation) is a major application for CsF in the laboratory, as its [[anhydrous]] nature allows clean formation of [[water (molecule)|water]]-sensitive intermediates.  Caesium fluoride in [[THF]] or [[Dimethylformamide|DMF]] can attack a wide variety of [[organosilicon compounds]] to produce an organosilicon fluoride and a [[carbanion]], which can then react with [[electrophile]]s<sup>[3]</sup>, for example<sup>[5]</sup>:
[[Image:CsF_desilylation.png|500px]]

Desilylation is also useful for the removal of [[silyl]] [[protecting group]]s.

Caesium fluoride is also a popular source of fluoride in [[organofluorine chemistry]].  For example, CsF reacts with [[hexafluoroacetone]] to form a caesium perfluoroalkoxide salt which is stable up to 60 °C, unlike the corresponding [[sodium]] or [[potassium]] salt<sup>[6]</sup>.

Single crystals of the salt are transparent into the deep [[infrared]]. For this reason it is often used as the windows of cells used for [[infrared spectroscopy]].

== Precautions ==
Like soluble fluorides, CsF is moderately toxic, see [http://www.hazard.com/msds/f2/bms/bmsqc.html Elf Atochem MSDS sheet].  Contact with [[acid]] should be avoided, as this forms highly toxic/corrosive [[hydrofluoric acid]].  Caesium [[ion]] (Cs<sup>+</sup>) ''per se'' (for example as [http://www.jtbaker.com/msds/englishhtml/c1903.htm CsCl]) is not generally considered toxic.
