'''''Kim Possible''''' is an [[Emmy Award]]-winning [[United States|American]] [[animated television series]] about a teenage crime fighter who has the task of dealing with worldwide, family, and school issues every day.  The show is action-oriented, but also has a light-hearted atmosphere and often lampoons the conventions and clichés of the secret-agent and action genres. 

== Production ==
Creators [[Mark McCorkle]] and [[Bob Schooley]] claim they created the show in an elevator.  As they tell it, McCorkle looked at Schooley and said, "Kim Possible: she can do anything".  Schooley at once replied, "Her partner is Ron Stoppable: he can't do anything".  The creators also maintain that it was always their intention for Kim and Ron to eventually become involved romantically, rather than just remaining best friends.  This becomes a reality in the supposed series-ending movie, ''[[Kim Possible: So the Drama]]''.  The romantic theme also continues in season four. 

The series premiered on [[Disney Channel]] in June [[2002]], and the first episode to air, ''Crush'', was nominated for a Primetime Emmy award the following year.  After the premiere of this episode, ''Kim Possible'' was the most watched and highest rated television show on Disney Channel at that time. The series as a whole was nominated for the Daytime Emmy  in [[2004]], and again in 2005 (that year it received 5 nominations and 1 win).<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0278866/awards Awards for "Kim Possible"] (2006), retrieved [[August 4]], [[2006]]</ref>.  The show has been widely praised for its smart dialogue, fluid animation, and engaging, well-written characters (both heroic and villainous).

On [[February 22]], [[2005]], after 3 seasons and 65 episodes, the show ended production. Due to the popularity of the series and grassroots operations by dedicated ''KP'' fans, Disney announced on [[November 29]], [[2005]], that the show would be renewed for a fourth season, which debuted on Disney Channel on [[February 10]], [[2007]]. The series finally ended permanently on September 7, 2007 with the airing of the one-hour-long concluding episode, "Graduation" (see below).

The show's title music, "Call Me, Beep Me", is sung by [[Christina Milian]].  Artist [[Shane Glines]] produced the original designs for KP.<ref>[http://www.shaneglines.net/contact/contact.html List of character designs], retrieved [[December 9]], [[2007]]</ref>

''Kim Possible'' also airs on [[Toon Disney]] and [[Family Channel]] in Canada. Some early episodes have been aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] as part of it's [[Saturday morning]] block [[ABC Kids (United States)|ABC Kids]]. A Mandarin version aired on [[CCTV-12]] in China, and an [[Arabic]] dub was also made which started airing on Dubai TV in early [[2006]] and is currently airing on [[MBC 3]] on the network's "Disney morning timeslot", the only thing that was changed were the character's names, for example Kim was called "''Damo Staheel''" (Mostaheel is Arabic for [[Impossible]]), Ron was called "''Mostah Aed''", Wade was called "''Awad''", Shego was called "''Shahira''", and Dr. Drakken was called "''Daraken''". The show aired on the French [[Disney Channel]] and then on [[TF1]]'s Disney show in [[France]]. Several changes were made in the names to fit with translated jokes: for example [[Ron Stoppable]] is called Robin Trépide ("Intrépide" meaning some kind of a courageous adventurer).

==Characters==
===Team Possible===
[[Image:Kim Possible Cast.jpg|thumb|right|300px|From left to right: [[Wade Load|Wade]], [[Dr. James Timothy Possible|Mr.]] and [[Mrs. Dr. Possible|Mrs. Possible]], [[Ron Stoppable|Ron]], [[Rufus (Kim Possible)|Rufus]], [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim]], [[Shego]], [[Doctor Drakken|Dr. Drakken]], [[Monkey Fist]], [[The Seniors|Señor Senior Sr.]], [[Minor villains in Kim Possible#Adrena Lynn|Adrena Lynn]], [[The Seniors|Señor Senior Jr.]]]]
* [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim Possible]] — The team leader, this red-haired crime-fighter who saves the world, also tries to live a normal teenage life; dealing with everyday problems.  She has been Ron's best friend since Pre-K, and has been his girlfriend since the night of their junior prom (Season 3).  Naturally, her name makes reference to the word 'impossible.'  Kim's dialogue tends to be peppered with not-so-typical teen [[slang]]; for example, "So not the drama" and "No big", as well as the series' catchphrase, "What's the sitch?" (slang for situation).
* [[Ron Stoppable]] — Kim's best friend since Pre-K, partner, and boyfriend.  Despite his role as the goofy sidekick, Ron has proven himself to be a very capable hero and also saves the world from time to time.  His name is a play on the word 'unstoppable'.
* [[Rufus (Kim Possible)|Rufus]] — Ron's pet [[naked mole rat]], considered a member of the team — in fact, he often proves to be more competent than Ron, or even Kim on occasion.
* [[Wade Load|Wade]] — The twelve-year-old super genius (completed high school and college in 8 months) who spends the majority of his time in his room and until the episode "Team Impossible" he is never seen in person.  He was seen before that in [[Kim Possible: A Sitch in Time]] but in an adult form. He is significantly seen in Season 4 (Odds Man in, The Cupid Effect, Homecoming Upset, Mad Dogs and Aliens, Cap'n Drakken and Graduation). He runs Kim's website, supplies her with gadgets, assigns her missions, arranges transportation for her, and even goes on missions with Kim on rare occasions. 
* [[Monique (Kim Possible)|Monique]] — A close friend of Kim.  Although she has no special abilities, she has helped out on missions a few times.
