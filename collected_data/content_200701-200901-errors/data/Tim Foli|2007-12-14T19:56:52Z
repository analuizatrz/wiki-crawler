</ref> is a former [[shortstop]] in [[Major League Baseball]] who played for the [[New York Mets]], [[Montreal Expos]], [[San Francisco Giants]], [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|California Angels]] and [[New York Yankees]] from {{by|1970}} to {{by|1985}}. At age 17, Foli was the [[List of MLB first overall draft choices|first pick]] in the [[Major League Baseball Draft]] in {{by|1968}} and went on to be a member of the [[1979 World Series]] champion Pirates.  He currently serves as the field coordinator for the [[Washington Nationals]].

==Overview==
Foli was known as a fiery player who was a reliable fielder, but only an average hitter. Foli was a free swinger, especially in {{by|1982}} when he [[Base on balls|walked]] only 14 times, the lowest total ever for 150 or more [[games played]] ([[Ozzie Guillén]] broke Foli's dubious record three years later). His free swinging did not aim for the fences, however, as he averaged less than two [[home run]]s per season. His lack of power, combined with a lack of running speed (averaging approximately a [[stolen base]] every 20 games), resulted in Foli typically batting either second in the lineup or near the bottom. Although he accumulated few walks, Foli was also one of the most difficult to [[strikeout]], posting the league's best strikeout percentage three times and finishing in the top ten five times. Foli hit well when it counted most as he compiled a .333 [[batting average]] in the 1979 postseason contributing to Pittsburgh's last World Championship. He was an accomplished [[Bunt (baseball)|bunter]], finishing in the league top ten in [[sacrifice hits]] eight times including an [[American League]]-leading 26 in 1982.

Defensively, Foli led league shortstops in [[fielding percentage]] in {{by|1980}} and 1982. He led the [[National League]] in [[double play]]s twice, in [[total chances]] twice, and in [[putout]]s once.  Foli's defensive low occurred on [[September 9]], [[1972]] when he committed three [[Error (baseball)|errors]] in one inning, leading to three runs in an 8-3 loss.

==Early life and career==
Tim Foli was born in [[Culver City, California]] and attended [[Notre Dame High School (Sherman Oaks)|Notre Dame High School]] in [[Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, California]]. He was a high school star in both baseball and [[American football|football]] and was offered a football [[scholarship]] by the [[University of Southern California]]. When the New York Mets made Foli the first overall [[Draft (sports)|draft pick]] in 1968, he decided to forego football for the major leagues.<ref name="Tennessean"> </ref>

At age seventeen, Foli started out poorly with the [[Marion Mets]] of the [[Appalachian League]]. The following year, while the Mets were on their way to winning the [[1969 World Series]], Foli hit over .300 for their "Triple A" level minor league team, the [[Visalia Mets]] of the [[California League]]. In {{by|1970}}, Foli posted decent numbers for the AAA [[Tidewater Tides]] and the Mets called the 19-year-old up to the majors on [[September 11]]. At the time, he was the fourth youngest player in the majors, behind [[César Cedeño]], [[Balor Moore]] and [[Don Gullett]]. In his second game, Foli started at [[Third baseman|third base]], picked up two hits and drove in a late insurance run as the Mets defeated the [[St. Louis Cardinals]]. The defending champions faded the rest of the way and missed the playoffs. 

Foli spent all of {{by|1971}} with the Mets, fighting for playing time at [[Second baseman|second base]] and third base. On [[May 9]], he had an RBI [[Triple (baseball)|triple]] and a three-run [[Double (baseball)|double]] in the first two innings for his first four-[[Run batted in|RBI]] game. It would prove to be his last four-RBI game until {{by|1979}}. In 97 games, his batting average was .226, with both his [[on base percentage]] and [[slugging average]] below .300.

==Montreal==
Before the {{by|1972}} season, on [[April 5]], the Mets packaged Foli with fellow young prospects [[Ken Singleton]] and [[Mike Jorgensen]] and sent them to the Montreal Expos for star [[outfielder]] [[Rusty Staub]]. Foli became a mainstay at shortstop in Montreal for the next five seasons. Although Foli, Singleton and Jorgensen played well in Montreal, the Expos never posted a winning record until after Foli was gone and even lost 107 games in {{by|1976}}.

Foli's offensive numbers in five seasons with Montreal were representative of his whole career. He batted between .238 and .264 each season, only once slugging over .300, and only once reaching .300 in on base percentage. {{by|1976}} was the only offensive season that stood out for Foli, as he posted career highs with 36 doubles (fifth-highest in the N.L.), six home runs and a .366 slugging average. On [[April 21]], [[1976]], Foli hit a [[Single (baseball)|single]], double and triple against the [[Chicago Cubs]] before the game was suspended.  When the game was resumed the next day, Foli hit a home run to complete the first [[hitting for the cycle|cycle]] in Montreal Expos history. In addition, Foli's cycle was the first "natural cycle" (where the single, double, triple and home run are hit in that sequence) in almost a decade.

Foli was popular in Montreal, as evidenced on [[July 8]], [[1973]]. [[Houston Astros]] [[left fielder]] [[Bob Watson]] slid hard into Foli at second base trying to break up a double play, breaking Foli's jaw. When Watson returned to left field in the next half-inning, the Montreal fans at [[Jarry Park Stadium|Jarry Park]] hurled debris at Watson.<ref name="AstrosDaily">{{cite web

</ref> Foli missed the next month of the season.

==Journeyman==
{{by|1977}} was the beginning of Foli's time as a major league journeyman. In his final nine seasons, Foli spent seven different stints with six different franchises. His travels began on [[April 22]], [[1977]] when he was traded to the San Francisco Giants for shortstop [[Chris Speier]]. Foli, who was batting .175 at the time of the trade, hit only .228 for the Giants, who finished well out of playoff contention. Foli's Giants highlight was on [[July 22]], when he had the only two-homer game of his career.

After the 1977 season, Foli's original team, the Mets, purchased his contract from San Francisco. {{by|1978}} was a typical season for Foli, who played 113 games and batted .257 while the Mets finished with the worst record in the [[National League]].

==Pittsburgh Championship==
After playing just three games for the Mets in {{by|1979}}, Foli and a minor league player were traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates in exchange for shortstop [[Frank Taveras]]. The trade sent Foli from the worst team in the league to one of the best. Pittsburgh was locked in a season-long battle with Montreal for first place, but took the lead for good in the final days of the season. Foli set career highs in batting average, RBI, runs, hits and on base percentage. He also struck out once every 38 at bats, a strikeout ratio which has not been bested since. 

Pittsburgh went on to sweep the [[1979 National League Championship Series]], with Foli driving in a run in all three games. In the World Series, Foli had a hit in six of the seven games, but the Pirates were trailing three games to one. Facing 23-game winner and 1979 [[Cy Young Award]] winner [[Mike Flanagan (baseball player)|Mike Flanagan]], Foli scored the tying run and drove in three insurance runs to keep the Pirates alive in Game 5. Foli then scored a run in Game 6 against [[Jim Palmer]] and the Pirates forced a Game 7. In the next game, with Foli's immense help, the Pirates won the World Championship.

Foli posted typical numbers for him in {{by|1980}} and the [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|strike-shortened]] {{by|1981}} season, but the Pirates, suffering from the decline of future [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Willie Stargell]], as well as other intangibles, dropped from World Champions to mediocrity.

==Final years==
After the 1981 season and shortly after his 31st birthday, Foli was traded yet again, moving from Pittsburgh to the California Angels in exchange for 22-year-old [[catcher]] [[Brian Harper]]. Foli was reunited with [[Gene Mauch]], his [[Manager (baseball)|manager]] from Montreal.  He was slated to be a [[utility infielder]] for the Angels, but when [[Rick Burleson]] went down with a torn [[rotator cuff]] in mid-April, Foli spent the season as the starting shortstop.<ref name="Burleson">{{cite web

</ref> A mid-September winning streak propelled the Angels into first place and into the [[1982 American League Championship Series|1982 American League playoffs]], but Foli managed only two hits and one RBI as the Angels lost to the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] three games to two.

Foli played very little in the last third of the next season, finishing with only 88 games. Towards the end of the season, Foli was suspended by the team for not being in uniform after a [[September 11]] rain delay.<ref name="Suspend">{{cite web

  |accessdate=2006-06-15
  |date=[[1983-09-13]]
  |publisher=[[The New York Times]]}}
</ref> The Angels traded Foli to the New York Yankees for [[pitcher]] [[Curt Kaufman]] after the season. In 61 games, Foli played all four [[infield]] positions for the Yankees, who traded him to his old stomping grounds in Pittsburgh after the season in a trade which brought 20-year-old [[Jay Buhner]] to the Yankees.

Foli batted just .189 in 19 games with the Pirates in {{by|1985}}, before Pittsburgh released him on [[June 17]] and retiring at age 34.

==Post-retirement==
After retirement as a player, Tim Foli turned to coaching. He was the third base coach and infield coach for the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] in {{by|1986}} and {{by|1987}}.<ref name="ZephyrsMeet">{{cite web
