'''Chester Cortez Thompson''' (born [[December 11]], [[1948]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]) (not to be confused with the [[Carlos Santana|Santana]] keyboard player) is an [[United States|American]] [[drummer]] and [[session musician]].

Thompson made his name as a session drummer, going on to play in [[Frank Zappa]]'s touring band (as part of the much loved 1973-1974 lineups which also featured percussionist [[Ruth Underwood]] and jazz keyboardist [[George Duke]]) and with [[Weather Report]]. He played on such noted Zappa albums as ''One Size Fits All'', ''Roxy & Elsewhere'', and ''Overnite Sensation''. His longest standing gig was with [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] from 1977, playing on their tours in that year, 1978, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983/4, 1986/7 and 1992/3 and is set to play on the 2007 [[Turn It On Again Tour]]. Chester is featured on their live albums ''[[Seconds Out]]'', ''[[Three Sides Live]]'' and ''[[Live/The Way We Walk, Volume One: The Shorts|The Way We Walk Volume 1]]'' and ''[[Live/The Way We Walk, Volume Two: The Longs|Volume 2]]''. Thompson continues to work with [[Phil Collins]] on his solo concert tours, drumming on the 1982/83 Hello I must be going tour, 1985 No Jacket Required tour, 1990 But Seriously tour, The Tarzan Premiere tour of 1999, The Final Farewell tour of 2004/05, Chester appears on Phil Collins' ''[[Serious Hits... Live!]]'' live album and DVD, and has released his own solo album, ''[[A Joyful Noise (album)|A Joyful Noise]]''.

Chester also plays on the Steve Hackett album, Genesis revisited. He  also appears on Tokyo Tapes album released in 1998 which features Steve Hackett and John Wetton amongst many others.

Chester has also played with Carlos Santana drumming on a few tours, whilst accompanied by Alphonso Johnson on bass giutar.

Chester's playing style is widely acknowledged and respected, and can be seen on numerous live videos of Genesis, from late 70's up to early 90's. His live playing with the band is a striking mixture of his own style and Collins' own, being equally comfortable with acoustic and electronic drums. Chester has endorsed of [[Pearl]] drums and [[Paiste]] cymbals, but now endorses of [[DW]] drums and [[Sabian]] cymbals.
