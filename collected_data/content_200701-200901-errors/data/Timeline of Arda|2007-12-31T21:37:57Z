{{History of Arda}}
This article includes several chronologies relating to [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[legendarium]].

==Events outside of time==

*Many Ainur enter Eä.

==Arda events==
Before the making of the [[Sun (Middle-earth)|Sun]] dates are given in [[Valian Years]] and not all events can be precisely dated. In such cases events are given in chronological order between known dates. All entries are derived from ''The Annals of Aman'' (see [[#General References|references]]) unless otherwise noted.
