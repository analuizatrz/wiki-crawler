The '''France national rugby union team''' is a national sporting side, representing [[France]] in [[rugby union]]. Rugby union is a popular sport in France, and the national team are one of the best in the world. France compete annually with [[England national rugby union team|England]], [[Italy national rugby union team|Italy]], [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]], [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] and [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] in the [[Six Nations Championship]]. They have won the competition outright on 14 occasions, shared in another eight wins and completed eight [[Grand_Slam_%28Rugby_Union%29#Six_Nations_Championship|grand slams]]. As of [[March 15]], 2007, they are the second-ranked team in the world, behind only the [[All Blacks]].<ref name=WorldRank>{{cite web | publisher=irb.com|title=IRB World Rankings |url=http://www.irb.com/EN/World+Rankings/  |accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref> France have competed at every [[Rugby World Cup]] and been runners-up twice. Six former French players have been inducted into the [[International Rugby Hall of Fame]].

Rugby was introduced to France in 1872 by the British and on [[New Year's Day]], [[1906]] the national side played its first [[Test match]] against the All Blacks in Paris. France played irregularly against the [[Home Nations]] until they joined them to form a Five Nations tournament (today, the Six Nations Championship) in 1910. France also competed in early [[Summer Olympics]] games winning one gold and two silver medals. In 1932 the French were ejected from the Five Nations mainly due to accusations of professionalism in the French leagues, and did not rejoin until 1939. During this period the team created a winning streak which still stands today. France came of age during the 1950s and 1960s, winning their first of many Five Nations as well as completing a successful tour of South Africa. They won their first [[Grand Slam (rugby union)#Six Nations Championship|Grand Slam]] in 1968, and won numerous titles in the following years. The [[1987 Rugby World Cup|first Rugby World Cup]] was held in 1987 and France became runners-up, losing to the All Blacks in the final. They would repeat their best result again in [[1999 Rugby World Cup|1999]], losing to [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]] in the final.

France traditionally play in [[blue]] shirts with [[white]] shorts and [[red]] socks, and are commonly referred to as the ''les tricolors'' and ''les bleus''. Their alternative strip is mainly white. French internationals are played at a variety of venues throughout the country, though it is [[Stade de France]] in the [[Paris]] suburb of [[Saint-Denis]] that is used for their games during the Six Nations. France are the host nation of the upcoming [[2007 Rugby World Cup]].

==History==
===Early years===
[[Image:Stade Français history.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Two Paris clubs, Stade Français and the Racing club de France playing each other in the 1890s.]]
Rugby was introduced to the Le Havre region of [[France]] by British merchants and students in the 1870s and was subsequently spread throughout the schools and colleges.<ref name="hundyears">{{cite web | url=http://www.irb.com/EN/News/Features/061114+dk+fre+rugby+100.htm| title=100 years of French Test rugby: part one | publisher=International Rugby Board | author=Chris Thau | date= [[2006-11-14]]| accessdate=2007-03-29}}</ref> The first clubs were established in the late 1870s and early 1880s, with a club championship soon formed, and games against English clubs organised.<ref name="hundyears"/> The first involvement a national rugby union side had was at the [[1900 Summer Olympics|1900 Paris Olympics]], where a French team took part in the tournament and defeated Britain (represented by Mosley Wanderers RFC) 27 - 8 and Germany 27-17 to win the gold medal.<ref name="olympics">{{cite web | url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/olympics.htm#france1900| title=Rugby at the 1924 Olympics | publisher=Rugby Football History | accessdate=2007-03-04}}</ref> However the team represent France at the 1900 games are not considered to be a Test XV.<ref name="hundyears"/> On [[January 1]], [[1906]] France played its first ever Test match - a 38-8 loss to [[Dave Gallaher]]'s [[All Blacks]] in [[Paris]].<ref name="ABGame88">{{cite web| url=http://stats.allblacks.com/teamsheet.asp?MT_ID=1088 |title=8th All Black Test : 88th All Black Game |publisher=allblacks.com |accessdate=2007-03-30}}</ref> In ''The Complete Rugby Footballer'', Gallaher and [[Billy Stead]] wrote of French rugby; "We are strongly of the opinion that the game will spread in their country and that in the course of time they will put a team in the field which will command the utmost respect of any other."<ref name="ABGame88"/> France first played [[England national rugby union team|England]] in March of that year, again in France, this time losing 35-8.<ref name="FranceEngland1906">{{cite web| url=http://2rugby.com/game/4551/ |title=France vs England |publisher=2rugby.com |accessdate=2007-03-30}}</ref>

France played their first Test outside their nation on the [[January 1]], [[1907]], losing to England 31-13 at the Athletic Ground in [[Richmond, England|Richmond]]. Two days later they played a game against the Springboks in [[Parc des Princes]], Paris with a side made up from the two Parisian clubs: Stade Français and Racing Club de France. Only two of the side that had faced the All Blacks played against the Springboks - three-quarter Paul Sagot and forward Georges Jérôme - and none was in the team that had played England. The Springboks scored 13 tries in winning 55-6.

===The Five Nations and the Olympics===
France played [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] for the first time on the 2nd of March 1908, losing 36 - 4 away from home. On March 20 1909, France played [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]] for the first time, beating them 19-8. This was Ireland's biggest victory in international rugby at that time, their highest points tally and a record five tries.

When [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] played France in the first official international match between the two countries in 1910, the foundation was laid for a [[Six Nations Championship|Five Nations competition]]. Their first win in the competition came against Scotland 16-15 in Paris in 1911. In early 1913, France was host to a touring [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springboks]] party, France lost 5 points to 35, the match was part of an era that last from 1911 until 1920 which saw France lose 18 games in a row.

In 1919, the [[Fédération Française de Rugby]] was formed, 13 years after France's Test debut. At the [[1920 Summer Olympics|1920 Antwerp Olympics]] there was another rugby event and France was one of only two teams to enter. A straight final took place between the USA and France but the USA caused a shock by winning 8-0 to take the gold medal.<ref name="olympics"/> Their first win in the five nations against Ireland was attained in 1920 in [[Dublin]] - 15-7. During their last match of the 1921 Five Nations, France showed signs of new strength beating Ireland 20 to 10. Though France did not win a game the following year, the side did draw with Scotland and England.

In 1924 rugby union was again an event at the [[1924 Summer Olympics|Olympics held in Paris]], France. France beat Romania 59-3, scoring 13 tries including four by the fine Stade Francais winger Adolphe Jaureguy. The final took place at Colombes Stadium in Paris on [[May 18]], [[1924]] and the USA took the gold with a 17-3 victory in front of 30,000 spectators.<ref name="olympics"/> The All Blacks returned to France in 1925, the first time since their inaugural Test against them in 1906, France lost 6 to 30.<ref name="nz25">{{cite web | url=http://stats.allblacks.com/tourbreak.asp?IDID=22| title=Australia, the British Isles, France and Canada | publisher=Allblacks.com | accessdate=2007-03-04}}</ref>

===Expelled from Five Nations===
The mid to late 1920s was a period of disappointment for the French, that is until they won their first games over England and Wales, in 1927 and 1928 respectively. France had mediocre results on field during the latter end of the decade and the start of the 1930s, but showed definite signs of improvements in the Five Nations. However, they were expelled from the Five Nations in 1932 following accusations of professionalism in the French league as well as on-field violence and poor organisation and were not allowed to rejoin until 1939.<ref name="fivenations">{{cite web | url=http://www.rugbyworld.com/Story/0,18830,3551_1884973,00.html| title=2/3/4/5/6 Nations Winners | publisher=Rugby World | accessdate=2007-03-04}}</ref> During this time many French players turned to [[rugby league]], which began to build in popularity, as the latter code was excluded from the Five Nations. Despite this there were some internationals played; [[Germany national rugby union team|Germany]] between 1932 and 1936, [[Italy national rugby union team|Italy]] (1937) and [[Romania national rugby union team|Romania]] (1938). On the 2nd of January 1934 [[FIRA - Association of European Rugby|FIRA]] was formed, an organisation to rival the [[International Rugby Board]] (IRB).

Having been expelled from the Five Nations and forced to play against weaker opposition, France went on a winning spree which still stands today, winning ten games in a row during the years from 1931 to 1936. During the [[Germany|German]] occupation of France in [[World War II]], [[Vichy France]] forcibly merged the French [[rugby league]] into the French [[rugby union]], declaring that there was only one rugby.

===Post war===
The Five nations resumed after the second World War in 1947 and French rugby came of age. [[Lucien Mias]] was the innovative captain whose [[line-out]] ploys bring a new attacking dimension to forward play. France beat Wales for the first time in 1948 and England in 1951.

In 1952, France played their second match against the Springboks and again lost 25-3. 

France claimed a share of the Five Nations title for the first time in 1954 alongside England and Wales. France also recorded their first win over New Zealand 3-0 at Stade Colombes in 1954.[http://www.nobok.co.uk/page/RugbyTimeDetail/0,,10301~791109,00.html]

In 1955, France had defeated England, Ireland and Scotland, a win against Wales would give France its first ever Grand Slam. However France lost to Wales 11-16 at Stade Colombes in Paris.

The French made their first visit to South Africa in 1958 and rocked the Springboks by winning the two-Test series. Led by Lucien Mias, in the absence of tour skipper Michel Celaya who had been injured, the underestimated French drew the first Test 3-3 at [[Newlands Stadium|Newlands]] and then produced an even bigger shock by beating the Springboks 9-5 at altitude at [[Ellis Park Stadium|Ellis Park]]. That tour was considered a watershed in the history of French rugby union; signaling that they were now among the top nations.

Victories over Scotland and Wales at the Stade Colombes, together with a 3-3 draw with England at Twickenham earned France their first outright Five Nations title in 1959. They arrived in Dublin as champions, only to be denied a Grand Slam by a 9-5 defeat.[http://www.nobok.co.uk/page/RugbyTimeDetail/0,,10301~791108,00.html]

===The sixties===
 
France's match against England ended in a stalemate and the two sides had to share the 1960 Five Nations trophy. Pierre Albaladejo set a record for the most drop goals, three, in the 23-6 victory over Ireland. France then embarked on a tour of Argentina. In three Tests, France scored 78 points in three victories while the Pumas scored only 12 points.[http://www.nobok.co.uk/page/RugbyTimeDetail/0,,10301~791046,00.html]

The Springboks formidable 1960/61 touring side defeated Scotland, Ireland, England and Wales but were held to a 0-0 draw at Stade Colombes. The game was almost abandoned after fighting broke out. The Tricolours toured New Zealand and Australia in 1961. They lost both games to New Zealand 5-3 and 32-3. The French played a single Test on Australian soil, they go home with a 15-8 win over the Wallabies.[http://www.nobok.co.uk/page/RugbyTimeDetail/0,,10301~791047,00.html]

France won the 1962 Five Nations, but missed out on the Grand Slam again after losing to Wales for the fourth year running. France lost a Test to Romania at the end of the year. 

In 1964, the Tricolores returned to South Africa for a single match in Springs, and beat the Boks again 8-6 in a Test described until his dying day by Dr Danie Craven as the worst yet to be seen in South Africa. 

France set a then record win over England in 1966. After back-to-back Welsh wins, the French won the 1967 Five nations title. The title came down to the last match of the championship against Ireland at Lansdowne Road which France won 11-6. France embarked on their first full-scale tour of South Africa. They were beaten 26-3 in Durban and 16-3 in the "Battle of Bloemfontein" but were able to come back and win the third 19-14 in Johannesburg and draw the last 6-6 in Cape Town.

Fifty-eight years after contesting their first Five Nations tournament, France won their first 'Grand Chelem' with a 14-9 win over Wales at the Arms Park in 1968. However, it was overshadowed by the deaths of Guy Boniface and Jean-Michael Capendeguy in road accidents.

France imploded the following year, losing their first three matches to Scotland, Ireland and England but draw with Wales to deny them a Grand Slam.

===1970-1995===

[[Jean Desclaux]] coached France between 1973 and 1980. The 1976 Championship went well for France, their only loss came against [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] and they beat [[England national rugby union team|England]] 30-9. 1977 saw France win their second Grand Slam with [[Jacques Fouroux]] as captain. In 1978 France finally became a full member of the International Rugby Board. France beat the All Blacks in New Zealand for the first time 24-19 on Bastille day 14 July, 1979.

On the 8th of November 1980 France play their last international against South Africa in the apartheid era. They were led by Jean-Pierre Rives and lost 15-37 to the Springboks at Newlands in what was termed the "Summer Test". [[Jacques Fouroux]] became the coach of France shortly before the 1981 Five Nations tournament. In the ten years that he managed the side, France won the Five Nations on six occasions and two Grand Slams (1981 and 1987). France's successes were based around their massive pack, a fact which upset a number of commentators in France who preferred a more technical approach. Famous names from this time included [[Philippe Sella]], [[Daniel Dubroca]] and [[Serge Blanco]].

France entered the [[1987 Rugby World Cup|inaugural World Cup]] as one of the favourites. France beat [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]] 30-24 in the semi final, coming from behind three times to triumph. France were unable to repeat the feat in the final against favourites [[All Blacks|New Zealand]] losing 29-9. After an embarrassing 12-6 defeat to [[Romania national rugby union team|Romania]] on French soil, Fouroux was given the sack.

With the ban on playing South Africa lifted, France toured South Africa. They were led by Olivier Roumat after tour captain Jean-Francois Tordo had suffered a horrific facial wound in the game against Western Province at Newlands. They lost to South Africa 'B' and Northern Transvaal and drew with Free State but then drew the first Test 20-20 in Durban and again upset the odds by taking the series with an 18-17 victory at Ellis Park. Knocked out by England in the quarter-finals in the [[1991 Rugby World Cup]], they were desperately unlucky to lose in the semi-finals to the hosts and eventual champions [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]] in [[1995 Rugby World Cup|1995]].

===Professional era===
[[Image:France Ecosse 6-02-2004.jpg|right|thumb|300px|France (white) playing Scotland in 2004.]]
As the game adjusted to the new professional era, the Championship was very much dominated by England, who coming off the 1995 win, bascked up with a tournament win in 1996. During the tournament, France actually defeated England, but it was their one point loss to Wales that prevented them from taking the title. After the Five Nations France hosted Romania, and later travelled to Argentina for a two match series; winning all fixtures. At the end of the year, they met Wales, who had beaten them in their last game of the Five Nations, though this time France won, 40 to 33, though this was followed by two losses to the Springboks at home.

After narrowly missing out on the 1996 Five Nations championship, France entered the tournament with confidence, and went through the competition undefeated. After the win, France played aspiring Five Nations entrants Italy, who defeated France 40 points to 32. After defeating Romania, France continued on to Australia for a two Test series, which they lost. At the end of the year, France defeated Italy, Romania and Argentina at home, and against host South Africa for a two Test series, losing both, the second by 40 points.

Despite performing poorly against the southern hemisphere teams of Australia and South Africa in 1997, France successfully defended their Five Nations title, and again completed a grand slam of the tournament, even defeating Wales 51 to nil. France also hosted Australia at the end of the year, though the Wallabies won, 32 to 21.

Their Five Nations title defense was off to a weak start, after defeating Ireland by just one point. France went onto lose every other match and finished [[Wooden spoon (award)|wooden-spoonists]] in the last ever Five Nations. [[Bernard Laporte]] became the first fully professional head coach at the end of 1999.

After mixed results during the mid-year, France stormed through the group stages at the [[1999 Rugby World Cup|1999 World Cup]] to finish atop of their pool. After defeating Argentina 47 to 26  in the quarter-finals, France proceeded to the semi-finals, where they met red hot favourites, the All Blacks. Trailing by 14 point at the beginning of the second half, Fabien Pelous’ toops mounted an outstanding display of attacking rugby, scoring 30 consecutive points to triumph 43-31. In the final,they met Australia; fatigue took hold as they were beaten convincingly 35 to 12 at Cardiff's new [[Millennium Stadium]].

===The Millennium===

In 2000, Italy joined the Five Nations, making the tournament the Six Nations. France did not perform to expectations in the revamped tournament, losing to both England and Ireland and finishing second behind England. After defeating Romania 67 to 20, France hosted Australia in Paris, who beat them 18 to 13 in a 1999 World Cup final re-match. This was followed by a two Test series against the All Blacks, which France lost one and won one.

France again did not perform that well in the 2001 Six Nations, losing to Ireland, Wales and England; and only finishing fifth. They did however manage victories over South Africa and Australia at the end of the year, as well as an impressive 77 to 10 win over Fiji. France went undefeated in the [[2002 Six Nations Championship]] to claim the first Six Nations grand slam. Though they later lost two games to Australia, France defeated South Africa, and drew with the All Blacks that year.
[[Image:France-Wales 24022007 - 10.jpg|thumb|300px|left|France playing Wales during the [[2007 Six Nations Championship]].]]

France lost two matches at the [[2003 Six Nations Championship|2003 Six Nations]], including their opening game with England, who would go onto win a grand slam. France finished only third. After the strong showing at the World Cup, France reproduced their Six Nations success of 2002 at the [[2004 Six Nations Championship]]. France won all five of their matches to win the tournament and complete a grandslam. France finished second, behind Wales in the [[2005 Six Nations Championship]], and the following year at the [[2006 Six Nations Championship|2006 tournament]], France won again, getting their third Six Nations trophy under Laporte.

In preparation for the [[2003 Rugby World Cup|2003 World Cup]], France played Argentina, the All Blacks and England, with mixed results. France won their opening match against Fiji at [[Brisbane]]'s [[Suncorp Stadium]], which saw them continue undefeated through the rest of the pool stages. They met Ireland at [[Telstra Dome]] in [[Melbourne]] in the quarter finals, which they won 43 points to 21. France then met England at [[Telstra Stadium]] in [[Sydney]], and went down seven to 24. At the same venue, France contested for third place with the All Blacks, and lost, finishing fourth overall in the tournament.

The following year France completed a tournament grand slam of the [[2004 Six Nations Championship|2004 Six Nations]], including a win over World Champions England. After a short successful tour of North America, France played southern hemisphere teams, Australia, Argentina and the All Blacks; losing all three. In 2005 France completed another strong Six Nations, losing only to eventual grand slam winners Wales. France lost a two Test series to South Africa, and lost  to Australia during the mid-year. At the end of the year, France continued Australia's run of losses, and completed heavy wins over Canada and Tonga, and a close victory over South Africa. France lost their opening game of the [[2006 Six Nations Championship|2006 Six Nations]], 16 to 20 to Scotland, but went on to defeat the other four nations to win the Six Nations.

In their final tournament before the [[2007 Rugby World Cup|2007 World Cup]], France's defence of their title proved again successful, although it came down to the final minutes of their last [[2007 Six Nations Championship|6 Nations]] game to regain the crown. France needed to beat Scotland by more than the Irish beat Italy to ensure that they would be champions again. They were successful, winning the Championship by 4 points.

==Strip==
[[Image:Logo XV de france.JPG|250px|thumb|Uniform of the French team]]
Until 1912, the uniform of the French team was not blue and did not have a rooster on it, but was white with two rings, one red and one blue. The rings were chosen by France  as its symbol for the Olympic games, there were only two rings because only two continents, America and Europe, participated in the Olympic games at that time.<ref name="logo1">{{fr icon}}{{cite web | url=http://www.sncf.com/actu/rugby/LSDT-premier-maillot-Equipe-France.html| title=Le premier maillot de l'Equipe de France | publisher=Sncf.com | accessdate=2007-03-04}}</ref>

After the first game won by France, against Scotland in 1911, Marcel Communeau who was then captain of the French team, asked that the team adopt the ''coq'' (rooster) as its symbol.<ref name="logo2">{{fr icon}}{{cite web | url=http://rugby-nomades.qc.ca/info-nomades/histoire_1911.php| title=2 janvier 1911 : la naissance d’une Nation | publisher=Rugby-nomades.qc.ca | accessdate=2007-03-04}}</ref> The rooster was probably chosen because it is considered as a proud and combative animal, that can be sometimes aggressive. The rooster was used previously as a symbol by a French team, a former soccer player, Jean Rigal, wore a uniform with this emblem as early as May 1910.<ref name="logo3">{{fr icon}}{{cite web | url=http://crdp.ac-bordeaux.fr/rugby/arts/5-01-02.pdf| title=Le coq dans le sport  | publisher=Crdp.ac-bordeaux.fr | accessdate=2007-03-04}}</ref>

The badge was initially white and red, it was embroidered and multicoloured after 1945, and later golden since 1970.<ref name="logo4">{{fr icon}}{{cite web | url=http://crdp.ac-bordeaux.fr/rugby/arts/5-01-01.pdf| title=Le coq sportif | publisher=Crdp.ac-bordeaux.fr | accessdate=2007-03-04}}</ref> The representation of the rooster was first realistic and detailed, later the outline was simplified, it is now abstract and stylized.

The symbol used by the French rugby team had a great success , it was later adopted by the French delegation at the Olympic games of 1920, the rooster is then perched on five Olympic rings.<ref name="logo5">{{fr icon}}{{cite web | url=http://www.museedusport.fr/histoire_objet.php| title=Ecusson en forme de coq, devenu emblème national | publisher=Musee du Sport | accessdate=2007-03-04}}</ref> The rooster is well known as the symbol of French teams, French players are sometimes called ''les coqs'' and some French supporters used to bring and release a rooster on the playing field before a game starts.

The French team traditionaly played in Blue shirts whites shorts and red socks, as as such they were nicknamed ''les tricolors''. In the new Nike strip The French team currently plays in a mostly blue uniform, which had lead to the team being relered to as ''les Beus'' (The Blue). When necessary (home games in Scotland and Italy), French players wear white colours, the reason for the home side changing strip is due to the age old rugby tradition of the home side changing strips in the event of a colour clash.

==Grounds==
[[Image:France All Blacks 16-11-2002.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Stade de France during a France-All Blacks fixture.]]
France plays internationals at a number of grounds throughout the country. Home matches during the Six Nations are played at Stade de France. During the 2005 and 2006 seasons, France played home internationals at venues such as [[Stade de France]], [[Saint Denis]]; [[Stade Gerland]], [[Lyon]]; [[Stade Vélodrome]], [[Marseille]]; [[Stade de la Beaujoire]], [[Nantes]] and [[Stadium Municipal|Stadium de Toulouse]], [[Toulouse]].

At the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]], there are ten venues being used for matches throughout the country (Cardiff, Wales and Edinburgh, Scotland will also host some games). The French cities hosting matches at the World Cup are [[Stade Félix Bollaert]], [[Lens]]; Stade de France, Saint-Denis; [[Parc des Princes]], [[Paris]]; Stade de la Beaujoire, Nantes; [[Stade Chaban-Delmas]], [[Bordeaux]], Stade Gerland, Lyon; [[Stade Geoffroy-Guichard]], [[Saint-Étienne]], [[Stade de la Mosson]], [[Montpellier]]; Stadium de Toulouse, Toulouse and Stade Vélodrome, Marseille. The final of the World Cup will be played at Stade de France.

Though 2007 is the first Rugby World Cup hosted by France, there have been multiple games played in France earlier during the [[1991 Rugby World Cup|1991]] and [[1999 Rugby World Cup|1999]] tournaments (primarily hosted by England and Wales respectively). In 1991, all Pool D matches (France's pool) were held around France, along with two quarter finals (England v France at Parc des Princes and New Zealand v Canada at [[Stadium Lille-Metropole]]). In 1999, similar to 1991, all Pool C (France's pool) matches were held around France along with one second round play-off and quarter final (at Stade de France).

During the early years France played internationals at venues such as Parc des Princes in Paris and the [[Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir|Stade Olympique de Colombes]] (also in Paris). The Stade Olympique de Colombes, or the Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir, was the main venue at the [[1924 Summer Olympics]], where rugby was also a sport. The largest stadium that France currently plays at is Stade de France, which is where the [[Top 14]] final is also held. It has a capacity of around 80,000.

==Record==
===Six Nations===
Frances' only annual tournament is the [[Six Nations Championship]], which is played against five other European Nations; England, Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales. France first contested the tournament in 1910 when the Home Nations became the Five Nations (Italy would later join in 2000). Not playing during the 1932–1939 seasons, they would join again in 1947. They first won in 1954, sharing the championship with both England and Wales. France shared with Wales again the next season, but won it alone for the first time in 1959. France's longest wait for a championship spanned 37 tournaments (1910 to 1954).

{{Six Nations wins}}

===World Cup===
France have competed at every [[Rugby World Cup]] since the competitions inception in 1987. They have also made it to at least the quarter final stages of every tournament. France have figured in the semi-finals and have twice been overall runners-up. They featured in the inaugural final against the All Blacks, which they lost 29-9. France were knocked out by England in the quarter-finals of the 1991 competition - where some games were also held around France with the final in London.

In 1995 France finished third overall, defeating England 19-9 in the third/fourth place play-off. [[Thierry Lacroix]] was also the tournaments top point scorer. Like 1991, for the 1999 competition, some games were played in France, and the team made it to the final but were defeated by Australia. In 2003 they finished fourth; losing the third/fourth place game to the All Blacks. [[Frédéric Michalak]] was the tournaments second highest point scorer and [[Christophe Dominici]] was in the top ten try scorers.
