'''''Return of Saturn''''' is the fourth album by [[United States|American]] [[third wave ska]] band [[No Doubt]], released by [[Interscope Records]] in April 2000 (see [[2000 in music]]).  After touring for two and a half years to promote its breakthrough album ''[[Tragic Kingdom]]'', No Doubt wrote several dozen songs for its follow-up and eventually settled on working with producer [[Glen Ballard]].  Creating the album became a tumultuous process lasting two years, during which there was dissension amongst band members and between the band and its label.  The album was completed after the band returned to the studio and recorded what became two of the album's [[single (music)|singles]].

The album maintains the [[New Wave music|New Wave]], [[ska]] and [[reggae]] themes of the band's previous work.  It is influenced by [[alternative rock]] and mixes several other styles such as [[funk]], [[cabaret]], and [[hip hop music]].  The lyrics describe singer [[Gwen Stefani]]'s pining for a more domestic life, contrasting that with her commitment to a music career.

Upon release, ''Return of Saturn'' received mixed reviews from music critics.  It debuted at number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] but was unable to measure up to the sales of ''Tragic Kingdom''.  The album produced four singles, only one of which charted on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot 100]].  At the [[43rd Grammy Awards]], ''Return of Saturn'' album was nominated for [[Best Rock Album]].

==Background==
After the success of No Doubt's breakthrough album ''[[Tragic Kingdom]]'' (1995), the band wrote more than twenty songs for a new album, influenced by artists such as [[The Cure]].<ref name="followup">[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1432728/19981111/no_doubt.jhtml "No Doubt Ready To Record 'Tragic Kingdom' Follow-Up"].

Stefani was born [[October 3]], [[1969]], and many of the songs were written during her Saturn return.<ref name="tense"/>

The music of ''Return of Saturn'' further explores the No Doubt's New Wave influences, while adding an [[alternative rock]] feel and maintaining some of the band's [[ska]] and [[reggae]] sounds.  [[Adrian Young]]'s drum part on "Simple Kind of Life" was mixed through [[low fidelity]] filters to give it the sound of a [[lo-fi music|lo-fi]] [[power ballad]].<ref name="singles">Montoya, Paris and Lanham, Tom.

No Doubt experiments with several new styles on the album.  "Ex-Girlfriend," which originally featured a [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]-style [[funk]] sound, was rewritten and includes [[rapping|rapped]] vocals over piano and [[flamenco]] guitar parts.  After opening with [[Gabrial McNair]]'s [[jazz funeral]] horn part over Young's [[beatboxing]], "[[Bathwater]]" proceeds into a song written in [[swing time]].<ref name="singles"/>  It was described as a combination of the band's [[2 Tone]] roots with the operatic [[slapstick]] of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]].<ref name="rs"/>  "Marry Me" features use of the [[tabla]], a pair of tuned hand drums prominent in India.  Young and bassist [[Tony Kanal]]'s contributions were compared to the [[rhythm]] of [[nu metal]] music, and the fragmented progression of "Comforting Lie" was likened to the work of [[Korn]].<ref name="rs"/>

The album's lyrics depict Stefani's maturation and [[femininity]], reflected by images of oral contraceptives, a wedding cake and makeup on the album cover, as well as her romantic relationship with Rossdale.  Her lyrics drew comparisons to the bitter, confessional styling of [[Hole (band)|Hole]] frontwoman [[Courtney Love]].<ref name="rs"/><ref>[http://www.nme.com/reviews/2119.htm "Return Of Saturn"].

"Ex-Girlfriend" discusses a failing relationship and, in "Suspension Without Suspense" and "Home Now" detail feelings of resentment, loneliness, and indecision.<ref name="rs"/>  On "Simple Kind of Life", she confesses to hoping for a mistake with her [[birth control]] and a desire to leaving music for a domestic life.<ref name="tense"/>  She contrasts this, however, with her need for independence:
{{quote|Anyone who knows me knows having a family has always been the most important thing to me.  I wanted to be a mother--which is an unconditional giving of love--and a supportive wife, and suddenly, I can't even be a good girlfriend, because I can't seem to find the right time to call.  I want to do it all, but I can only do one thing good, and right now I've chosen to do this.  Being in a band is a bit of a selfish choice.|Gwen Stefani|''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''<ref name="tense"/>}}

==Reception==
The album received mixed reviews from music critics.  ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' characterized the album as filled with "smoother, layered mid-tempo ballads as creamily textured as extra-thick [[mille-feuille|napoleon pastries]]" but stated that Stefani's lyrics were too much of a throwback to the alternative rock scene of the early 1990s and contrasted with the boom of [[teen pop]].<ref>Browne, David.
