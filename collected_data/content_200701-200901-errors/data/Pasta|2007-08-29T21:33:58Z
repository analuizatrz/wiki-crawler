'''Pasta''' is a type of [[food]] made from a [[dough]] using [[flour]], [[water]] and/or [[Egg (food)|eggs]]. The dough is shaped and can be stored. The pasta is boiled prior to consumption. There are many variations of shapes and ingredients that are all called pasta. Some English speakers say that pastas are a type of [[noodle]]. A few examples include [[spaghetti]] (solid [[cylinders]]), [[macaroni]] ([[Tubing (material)|tubes]] or hollow cylinders), [[lasagna]] (sheets).  

Pasta can also denote dishes in which pasta products are the primary ingredient, served with sauce or seasonings. The word comes from [[Italian language|Italian]] ''pasta'' which shares its origins with "paste", meaning "dough", "pasta", or "pastry" as in "small cake". As recently as [[1918]] the English word "paste" was used instead of or alongside the Italian ''pasta''.<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/87/0006.html The Boston Cooking-School Cook Book. Chapter VI. CEREALS. Fannie Farmer]. Original text from of the 1918 edition of [[Fannie Merritt Farmer]]'s [[Boston Cooking-School Cook Book]].</ref>

==Ingredients==
There are many ingredients that can be used to make pasta dough. They range from a simple flour and water mixture, to those that call for the addition of eggs, spices and cheeses to the dough.  

Under Italian law, dry pasta can only be made from [[durum]] wheat [[semolina]] flour. This flour has a yellow tinge in color. Italian pasta is traditionally cooked ''al dente'' (Italian: "to the teeth", meaning not too soft). Abroad (notably in the [[United States]), dry pasta is frequently made from other types of flour (such as [[farina]]), but this yields a softer product, which cannot be cooked ''al dente''.

Particular varieties of pasta may also use other grains and/or milling methods to make the flour. Some pasta varieties, such as [[Pizzoccheri]], are made from [[buckwheat]] flour. Various types of fresh pasta include [[egg]]s (''pasta all'uovo''). [[Gnocchi]] are often listed among pasta dishes, although they are quite different in ingredients (mainly milled [[potato]]es).

==Preparation==
[[Image:Moser Spaghetti essender Junge.jpg||thumb|left|200px|''Boy with [[Spaghetti]]'' by Julius Moser, c.1808]]  
Pasta can be made by hand but is more commonly made with special tools or machines. [[Extrusion]] tools force ingredients through holes in a plate known as a [[Die (manufacturing)|die]]. Lamination tools squeeze ingredients through rollers into sheets of a particular thickness, which are then cut by slitters. 

Fresh pasta cooks quickly, but spoils relatively quickly due to its high water content. Dry pasta generally contains about 12.5% moisture, which makes it [[shelf stable]] for about three years. Packed refrigerated or frozen pasta can be found with relative ease in most pasta consuming countries. More varieties tend to be available where [[expatriate]] Italian communities have taken root. Italian companies manufacture machines for producing "fresh" packed pasta, which has a [[shelf life]] of around 7 weeks.

Some have attributed the innovation of dried pasta, in the form of long thin noodles we use today (spaghetti) to the Arabs who populated Southern Italy (i.e. Sicily) around the 12th Century. Prior to this, Italians are said to have eaten their pasta freshly made (''pasta fresca'') in a gnocchi like form.

Common pasta sauces in [[Northern Italy]] include [[pesto]] and [[ragù alla bolognese]]; in [[Central Italy]], simple [[tomato sauce]], [[amatriciana]] and [[carbonara]], and in [[Southern Italy]], spicy tomato, garlic, and olive oil based sauces, often paired with fresh vegetables or seafood. Varieties include [[puttanesca]], ''spaghetti alla norma'' (tomatoes and eggplant), ''pasta con le sarde'' (fresh sardines, pine nuts, fennel and olive oil). 

[[Fettuccine Alfredo]], with cheese and butter, and spaghetti with tomato sauce with or without ground meat or meatballs are popular Italian-style dishes in the [[United States]].

== Pasta varieties ==


Pasta comes in many different shapes and sizes. There are simple string-shaped pasta like [[spaghetti]] and [[vermicelli]], ribbon-shaped ones like [[fettuccine]] and [[linguine]], short tubes like [[elbow macaroni]] and [[penne]], decorative fancy shapes like [[farfalle]] and [[rotelle]], large sheets like [[lasagna]], and hollow pasta stuffed with filling, like [[ravioli]], [[manicotti]], and [[tortellini]]. ''See [[List of pasta]] for more detailed descriptions of varieties of pasta.''

The basic ingredients are usually the same; the shape and characteristics of each variety's surface makes it better suited for certain kinds of sauce.
