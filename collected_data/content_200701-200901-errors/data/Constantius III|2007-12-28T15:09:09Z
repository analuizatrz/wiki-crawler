'''Flavius Constantius''' (d. [[2 September]] [[421]]), whose Roman name is traditionally [[anglicized]] as '''Constantius III''', was a late Roman general, politician, and [[Roman Emperor|emperor]].  He also held the position of King of Britainnia for much of the 410s, and in [[421]] briefly became co-emperor of the [[Western Roman Empire|Western Empire]] with [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] before being assassinated in Rome.  

Constantius was born in Naissus (modern-day [[Nis|Niš]]) and was probably a career soldier.  As a [[magister militum]] under Honorius, he gained note by his successful campaigns in defense of the [[Western Roman Empire]], in which he pushed back barbarian invasions and ended the revolt of the usurper [[Constantine III (usurper)|Constantine III]]. As a result, he was given the title of [[Patrician]], and began to exert more and more influence over the weak Honorius. In [[417]] he married Honorius' sister, [[Galla Placidia]], and on [[February 8]], [[421]], was elevated to co-Emperor.  At this point, he effectively ruled the West.  Notably, Constantius reportedly complained about the loss of personal freedom and privacy that came with the imperial office.

Honorius' nephew, the [[Eastern Roman emperor]] [[Theodosius II]] refused to recognize Constantius' imperial status. Constantius reportedly intended to launch a campaign against the Eastern Empire to force recognition of his rights, but before anything could come of these plans, he died suddenly on [[September 2]] after less than seven months as emperor.

Constantius and Galla Placida had two children, the future emperor [[Valentinian III]] and [[Justa Grata Honoria]].

Constantius' success in rising from head of the dwindling Roman army to Imperial rank obviously influenced the actions of later holders of the patrician office, a list that includes [[Flavius Aëtius|Aëtius]] and [[Ricimer]]; however, only [[Petronius Maximus]] would ultimately make the same leap, and his reign would prove to be even shorter than Constantius'.
