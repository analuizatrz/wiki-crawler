'''''Tekken''''' is an [[anime]] [[motion picture]], based on [[Namco]]'s best-selling [[video game franchise]] ''[[Tekken]]''. The story is an amalgamation of the first two games in the series, focusing on the first [[Tekken|King of Iron Fist Tournament]] while giving a prominent role to [[Jun Kazama]], who was introduced in ''[[Tekken 2]]''. The film was released on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]] in [[North America]] by [[ADV Films]] and has occasionally been aired on [[cable television]] in the U.S.

==Plot outline==
{{spoiler}}
The film begins with a flashback featuring [[Kazuya Mishima]], a child studying martial arts under his father. He meets a young girl named [[Jun Kazama]], who is crying after seeing a [[bobcat]] kill a defenseless [[rabbit]]. When Kazuya offers to go fight the bobcat, Kazuya's father, [[Heihachi Mishima]], appears and drags Kazuya away. To make his son prove his strength, Heihachi throws Kazuya into a deep ravine, but not before ripping a locket containing a picture of Kazuya's mother from his son's neck and tossing it aside.

Jun, who tried and failed to locate Kazuya, finds the locket and keeps it with her into adulthood. As an adult, she joins an investigative agency and is asked to infiltrate The King of Iron Fist Tournament, which is  being sponsored by Heihachi, leader of the massive [[Mishima Zaibatsu]]. At the same time, Kazuya elects to attend the tournament to seek revenge on his father, who had since adopted another son in [[Lee Chaolan]], who in turn sees Kazuya as nothing more than a barrier to his own success.

At the island on which the tournament is to be held, Jun encounters Kazuya for the first time since that day, but senses something dark and malevolent about him. Kazuya tries to brush her aside when an assassin breaks in and attempts to kill him under Lee's orders. Jun helps Kazuya fight off the attack, but Kazuya has no interest in hearing Jun out.

On the day of the tournament, Kazuya and Jun fight their way through the other competitors on the island. Kazuya intends to fight his way to the center and kill his father, while Jun races to stop him. After catching up to him, Jun begins to make another appeal when they're attacked by monsters released by Lee, but they fight them off. Kazuya then continues on his way and quickly beats Lee in direct combat before squaring off against Heihachi.

The fighting is brutal, but Kazuya, who formed a pact with a devil to survive his fall into the ravine as a child, uses his demonic power to defeat his father. Before he can finish him off, however, Jun steps in one last time, and convinces Kazuya that he's going about things the wrong way. Kazuya is able to calm his spirit, and he takes mercy on his father. In the meantime, Lee, convinced that the Mishima Zaibatsu should be destroyed if he isn't allowed to inherit it, activates a self-destruct mechanism on the island. Kazuya, Jun and most of the other competitors are able to escape by ship, while Heihachi himself flees the island by air.

In a brief epilogue, Jun is by herself among some trees when her young son, [[Jin Kazama]], who bears a strong resemblance to Kazuya, runs up to her, and they walk off together.

The other major subplot, which runs concurrently with the rest of the film, features [[Lei Wulong]] working as Jun's partner, who investigates the weapons lab located below the surface of the island with the help of the combat android [[Jack (Tekken) #Jack-2|Jack-2]], who wants to cure a little girl of her illness. A few other fighters from the games, most notably [[Bruce Irvin]], [[Baek Doo San]], [[Michelle Chang]], [[Anna Williams]], [[Nina Williams]], [[Jack (Tekken) #Prototype Jack|Prototype Jack]], [[Roger (Tekken)|Roger]], and [[Ganryu (Tekken)|Ganryu]] play small parts in the story. Most of the other game characters like [[King (Tekken)|King]], [[Armor King]], [[Yoshimitsu (Namco)|Yoshimitsu]], [[Marshall Law (Tekken)|Marshall Law]], and [[Paul Phoenix (Tekken)|Paul Phoenix]] appear in background cameos with no direct influence on the story.

==Notable differences from game to film==
The ''Tekken'' motion picture takes several liberties with its source material. Along with combining events from the first two games in the series, it also rewrites important events. For instance, in the video games, there is no direct evidence suggesting that Jun and Kazuya ever met as children, and therefore Jun couldn't have seen Heihachi throw Kazuya into the ravine. The film also gives Anna Williams a rather gruesome death, but she remains alive and well in the fifth game in the series. For these reasons and others, the film is generally seen as a poor adaptation of the video games, but is still considerably more accurate than many American live-action game adaptations such as ''[[Super Mario Bros. (film)|Super Mario Bros.]]'' and ''[[Street Fighter (film)|Street Fighter]]'', which paid considerably less attention to the source material.

Aside from its quality as an adaptation, ''Tekken'' is generally seen as a [[cult film]] or guilty pleasure to its relatively small group of supporters. Some fans also use the film to help explain how Kazuya and Jun conceived their son Jin, who would go on to become the lead protagonist of the video games in ''[[Tekken 3]]'', since the video games have remained rather ambiguous on those details. Because of the number of liberties that the film takes with the storyline, the film cannot be considered completely [[Canon (fiction)|canon]], but the possibility that Jun and Kazuya's storyline as depicted in the film may share parallels with the video games remains open.

==Reaction==
''Tekken: The Motion Picture'' has been hailed and panned by fans and critics alike. The root of the movie's popularity stems from the action and the fighting, which fans consider to be outstandingly realistic. But the designs and English voices for some of the characters have led others to dislike the film, especially for Kazuya's striking resemblance to ''[[Dragon Ball Z|Dragon Ball Z's]]'' [[Vegeta]].

== Tekken (2009 film) ==
Little has been revealed about the new Tekken movie. What is known is that it is set later on than in the Anime film.  [[Charles Stone III]] is reported to be directing.
