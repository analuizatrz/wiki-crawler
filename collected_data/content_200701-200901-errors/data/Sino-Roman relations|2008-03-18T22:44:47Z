'''Sino-Roman relations''' started first on an indirect basis during the [[2nd century BCE]]. [[China]] and [[Roman Empire|Rome]] progressively inched closer with the [[embassy|embassies]] of [[Zhang Qian]] in [[130 BCE]] and the military expeditions of China to [[Central Asia]], until general [[Ban Chao]] attempted to send an envoy to Rome around [[100]] [[CE]]. Several alleged Roman embassies to China were recorded by a number of ancient [[China|Chinese]] [[historian]]s.  The first one on record, supposedly from either the [[Roman emperor]] [[Antoninus Pius]] or the later emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]], arrived in [[166|166 CE]]. 

==Zhang Qian's embassy==
[[Image:HanHorse.JPG|thumb|230px|A horse statuette of the Late [[Han Dynasty]] (1st–2nd century CE).]]

In [[130 BCE]], with the embassies of the [[Han Dynasty]] to Central Asia, following the reports of the ambassador [[Zhang Qian]] (who was originally sent to obtain an alliance with the [[Yuezhi]] against the [[Xiongnu]], but in vain), the [[Chinese emperor]] [[Emperor Wu of Han China|Wudi]] became interested in developing relationships with the sophisticated urban civilizations of [[Ferghana]], [[Bactria]] and [[Parthia]]: 

:''The Son of Heaven on hearing all this reasoned thus: Ferghana ([[Dayuan]]) and the possessions of [[Bactria]] (Daxia) and [[Parthia]] (Anxi) are large countries, full of rare things, with a population living in fixed homes and given to occupations somewhat identical with those of the Chinese people, but with weak armies, and placing great value on the rich produce of China'' - ''Hou Hanshu'' ([[Later Han History]]).

The Chinese subsequently sent numerous embassies, around ten every year, to these countries and as far as [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] [[Syria]]. “Thus more embassies were dispatched to ''Anxi'' ([[Parthia]]), ''Yancai'' (who later joined the [[Alans]]), ''Lijian'' ([[Syria]] under the [[Seleucids]]), ''Tiaozhi'' ([[Chaldea]]) and ''Tianzhu'' (northwestern India)… As a rule, rather more than ten such missions went forward in the course of a year, and at the least five or six.” ''Hou Hanshu'' (Later Han History).

==Chinese silk in the Roman Empire==
[[Image:Menade.jpg|thumb|230px|Menade in [[silk]] dress, [[Naples]] National Museum.]]

[[Roman commerce|Trade with the Roman Empire]] followed soon, confirmed by the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] craze for Chinese [[silk]] (supplied through the [[Parthians]]) from the [[1st century BCE]]. Although the Romans knew of wild silk harvested on [[Kos|Cos]], they did not at first make the connection with Chinese silk. Hence, Pliny the Elder, in his ''Natural History'', wrote:

''The [[Seres]] (Chinese), are famous for the woolen substance obtained from their forests; after a soaking in water they comb off the white down of the leaves… So manifold is the labour employed, and so distant is the region of the globe drawn upon, to enable the Roman maiden to flaunt transparent clothing in public'' — ([[Pliny the Elder]], ''The Natural History'' VI, 54 ).

Yet later in the same work, he writes:

''The larva [of the 'bombyx'] then becomes a caterpillar, after which it assumes the state in which it is known as 'bombylis', then that called 'necydalus', and after that, in six months, it becomes a silk-worm. These insects weave webs similar to those of the spider, the material of which is used for making the more costly and luxurious garments of females, known as 'bombycina'. Pamphile, a woman of Cos, the daughter of Platea, was the first person who discovered the art of unravelling these webs and spinning a tissue therefrom; indeed, she ought not to be deprived of the glory of having discovered the art of making vestments which, while they cover a woman, at the same moment reveal her naked charms.'' ([[Pliny the Elder]], ''The Natural History'' XI, 26).

The [[Roman Senate|Senate]] issued, in vain, several edicts to prohibit the wearing of silk, on economic and moral grounds: the importation of Chinese silk caused a huge outflow of gold, and silk clothes were considered to be decadent and immoral:

:''I can see clothes of silk, if materials that do not hide the body, nor even one's decency, can be called clothes... Wretched flocks of maids labour so that the adulteress may be visible through her thin dress, so that her husband has no more acquaintance than any outsider or foreigner with his wife's body''&mdash;([[Seneca the Younger]] c. [[3 BCE]]–[[65|65 CE]], ''Declamations'' Vol. I).

The Roman historian [[Florus]] also describes the visit of numerous envoys, including ''[[Seres]]'' (perhaps the Chinese), to the first Roman Emperor [[Caesar Augustus|Augustus]], who reigned between [[27 BCE]] and [[14|14 CE]]:

:''Now that all the races of the west and south were subjugated, and also the races of the north, (...) the Scythians and the Sarmatians sent ambassadors seeking friendship; the Seres too and the Indians, who live immediately beneath the sun, though they brought elephants amongst their gifts as well as precious stones and pearls, regarded their long journey, in the accomplishment of which they had spent four years, as the greatest tribute which they rendered, and indeed their complexion proved that they came from beneath another sky.''&mdash;([[Florus]] ''Epitomae'' II, 34).

A maritime route opened up with the Chinese-controlled [[Jiaozhi]] (centred in modern Vietnam) and the Vietnamese kingdom of [[Funan]] probably by the first century CE. At the formerly coastal site of [[Óc Eo]] in the Mekong Delta, Roman coins were among the vestiges of long-distance trade discovered by the French archaeologist Louis Malleret in the 1940s.<ref>Milton Osborne, ''The Mekong: Turbulent Past, Uncertain Future'' (2001:25).</ref> Óc Eo may have been the port known to the geographer Ptolemy and the Romans as [[Kattigara]]. The trade connection extended, via ports on the coasts of India and [[Sri Lanka]], all the way to Roman-controlled ports in [[Egypt]] and the [[Nabataean]] territories on the northeastern coast of the [[Red Sea]]. The ''[[Hou Hanshu]]'' records that a delegation of Roman envoys arrived in China by this maritime route in [[166|166 CE]]; this may well have been an exaggeration, by the envoys or the scribe, of what was actually an unofficial party of Roman merchants.

==Castaways==
[[Pomponius Mela]] ([http://ourworld-top.cs.com/latintexts/m305.htm Book III,Chapter 5]), copied by [[Pliny the Elder]], wrote that [[Caecilius Metellus|Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer]], [[proconsul]] in [[Gaul]], 59 BC, got 'several Indians' (''Indi'') as a present from a [[Germanic king]]. The Indians were driven by a storm to the coasts of [[Germania]] (''in tempestatem ex Indicis aequoribus''):
:''Metellus Celer recalls the following: when he was Proconsul in [[Gaul]], he was given people from India by the king of the [[Suebi|Sueves]]; upon asking why they were in this land, he learnt that they were caught in a storm away from India, that they became castaways, and finally landed on the coasts of Germany. They thus resisted the sea, but suffered from the cold for the rest of their travel, and that is the reason why they left.'' (Sueves is an [[textual criticism|emendation]] to the text.)

It is unclear whether these castaways were people from [[India]] or Eastern Asia, since "Indians" designated all Asians, Indian and beyond, during Roman times. Pomponius is using  these ''Indi'' as evidence for the [[Northeast Passage]] and the northward strait out of the [[Caspian Sea]] (which in Antiquity was usually thought to be open to [[Oceanus]] in the north). [[Edward Herbert Bunbury]] suggests that they were of [[Finnish people|Finnish]] origin. There are also some speculations that they may have been American Indians [[Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact|castaway across the Atlantic]].

Some confusion may be suspected in this passage since Metellus Celer died before taking up his proconsulship, thus leaving it free for [[Julius Caesar]].

==Roman soldiers in the East==
[[Image:Margiana-300BCE.png|thumb|300px|right|The Roman prisoners of the [[Battle of Carrhae]] were brought to [[Margiana]] by king [[Orodes II of Parthia|Orodes]].]]
There are several known instances of Roman soldiers being captured by the Parthians and transferred to the East for border duty.  According to Pliny, in [[54 BCE]], after losing at the [[battle of Carrhae]], 10,000 Roman prisoners were displaced by the Parthians to [[Margiana]] to man the frontier (of the 40,000
troops under Crassus, half had lost their lives, one quarter escaped, and one quarter were taken prisoner):
:"It was to this place (Margiana) that [[Orodes II of Parthia|Orodes]] conducted such of the Romans as had survived the defeat of [[Crassus]]" (Plin. Hist. Nat. 6. 18<ref>"Next comes the district of [[Margiane]], so remarkable for its sunny climate. It is the only spot in all these regions that produces the vine, being shut in on every side by verdant and refreshing hills. This district is fifteen hundred stadia in circumference, but is rendered remarkably difficult of access by sandy deserts, which extend a distance of one hundred and twenty miles: it lies opposite to the country of Parthia, and in it Alexander founded the city of Alexandria. This place having been destroyed by the barbarians, [[Antiochus]], the son of [[Seleucus]], rebuilt it on the same site as a Syrian city. For, seeing that it was watered by the Margus, which passes through it, and is afterwards divided into a number of streams for the irrigation of the district of Zothale, he restored it, but preferred giving it the name of Antiochia. The circumference of this city is seventy stadia: it was to this place that [[Orodes]] conducted such of the Romans as had survived the defeat of [[Crassus]]." [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+6.18 Source:Plin. Hist. Nat. 6. 18]</ref>)

About 18 years later the nomadic [[Xiongnu]] chief [[Zhizhi]] established a state in the nearby [[Talas River|Talas valley]], near modern day [[Taraz]]. The Chinese have an account by [[Ban Gu]] of about "a hundred men" under the command of Zhizhi who fought in a so-called "fish-scale formation" to defend Zhizhi's wooden-palisade fortress against [[Han Dynasty|Han]] forces, in the [[Battle of Zhizhi]] in [[36 BCE]]. The historian [[Homer Dubs]] claimed that this might have been the Roman [[testudo formation]] and that these men, who were captured by the Chinese, were able to found the village of [[Liqian]] (Li-chien) in [[Yongchang County]].  There is, however, no evidence that these men were Romans, although male inhabitants of Liqian are to undergo DNA testing to test the hypothesis.<ref>Sources on Roman soldiers in China: [http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-08/24/content_3396301.htm Xinhua], [http://www.archaeology.org/9905/newsbriefs/china.html Archaelogy.org] [http://www.italymag.co.uk/italy_regions/tuscany/2005/07/ Italy Magazine]

==The expedition of Ban Chao==
[[Image:Daqin in Sancai Tuhui.jpg|thumb|The Chinese impression of the Daqin people, from the [[Ming Dynasty]] encyclopedia ''[[Sancai Tuhui]]'']]
In [[97]], [[Ban Chao]] crossed the [[Tian Shan]]  and [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]] mountains with an army of 70,000 men in a campaign against the [[Xiongnu]]/[[Huns]], who were harassing the trade routes now known as the [[Silk Road]]. The Han general made an alliance with the Parthian king [[Mithradates II]] and established his base on shores of the [[Caspian Sea]] and at [[Antiochia Margiana]] ([[Merv]]) at the eastern outpost of the [[Parthian Kingdom]] (''NOTE:'' The correct information here should state that Han general Ban Chao established an alliance with the Parthian king [[Pacorus II of Parthia]], as Mithradates II was already dead by the time Ban Chao arrived in Parthia).  It was from here that the Han general dispatched envoy Gan Ying to [[Daqin]] (Rome). Gan Ying left a detailed account of western countries, although he apparently only reached as far as Mesopotamia.  While he intended to sail to Rome through the Black Sea, some Parthian merchants, interested in maintaining their profitable role as the middleman in the trade between China and Rome, falsely told him the dangerous trip would take two years at the least (when it was actually closer to two months). Deterred, he returned home.

Gan Ying left an account on [[Rome]] ([[Daqin]] in Chinese) which may have relied on second-hand sources. He locates it to the west of the sea:
:''Its territory covers several thousand [[Li (Chinese unit)|li]] [a "li" is around half a kilometre], it has over 400 walled cities.  Several tens of small states are subject to it.  The outer walls of the cities are made of stones.  They have established posting stations…  There are pines and cypresses.'' (''Hou Hanshu'', cited in Leslie and Gardiner).

He also describes the adoptive monarchy of the Emperor [[Nerva]], and Roman physical appearance and products:
:''As for the king, he is not a permanent figure but is chosen as the man most worthy… The people in this country are tall and regularly featured. They resemble the Chinese, and that is why the country is called Da Qin  (The "Great" [[Qin]])… The soil produced lots of gold, silver and rare jewels, including the jewel which shines at night… they sew embroidered tissues with gold threads to form tapestries and damask of many colours, and make a gold-painted cloth, and a "cloth washed-in-the-fire" ([[asbestos]]).'' (''Hou Hanshu'', cited in Leslie and Gardiner).

Finally Gan Ying determines Rome correctly as the main economic power at the western end of Eurasia:
:''It is from this country that all the various marvellous and rare objects of foreign states come.'' (Hou Hanshu, cited in Leslie and Gardiner).

==The eastern travels of Maes Titianus==
[[Image:LocationOfTashkurgan.jpg|thumb|Maes Titianus went as far as [[Tashkurgan]], known as the "Stone Tower" in [[Antiquity]], the doorstep to [[China]] (in blue).]]
[[Maes Titianus|Maës Titianus]] was the ancient traveller of [[Hellenistic]] culture<ref> His "[[Macedon]]ian" origin betokens no more than his cultural affinity, and the name Maës is Semitic in origin (Cary 1956:130).</ref> who penetrated farthest east along the [[Silk Road]] from the Mediterranean world. In the early second century CE<ref>The mainstream opinion, noted by Cary 1956:130 note 7, based on the date of Marinus, established by his use of many [[Trajan]]ic foundation names but none identifiable with [[Hadrian]].</ref> or at the end of the first century BCE,<ref>This is Cary's dating.</ref> during a lull in the intermittent Roman struggles with [[Parthia]], his party reached the famous Stone Tower, ''[[Tashkurgan]]'',<ref>Centuries later ''Tashkurgan'' ('Stone Tower') was the capital of the Pamir kingdom of [[Sarikol]].</ref> in the [[Pamirs]].

==First Roman embassy==
With the expansion of the [[Roman Empire]] in the Middle East during the [[2nd century]], the Romans gained the capability to develop shipping and trade in the [[Indian Ocean]]. Several ports containing Roman ruins have been excavated on the coast of India.
[[Image:PtolemyWorldMap.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Ptolemy]]'s world map, reconstituted from Ptolemy's [[Geographia (Ptolemy)|''Geographia'']] (circa [[150]]), indicating "Sinae" ([[China]]) at the extreme right, beyond the island of "Taprobane" ([[Sri Lanka]], oversized) and the "Aurea Chersonesus" (Southeast Asian peninsula).]]
Groups of Romans probably travelled farther eastwards, either on Roman, Indian, or Chinese ships. The first group of people claiming to be an ambassadorial mission of Romans to China was recorded in [[166]], sixty years after the westbound expeditions of the Chinese general [[Ban Chao]]. The embassy came to [[Emperor Huan of Han China|Emperor Huan]] of [[Han China]] "from ''Antun'' (Emperor [[Antoninus Pius]]), king of [[Daqin]] (Rome)". (As '''Antoninus Pius''' died in [[161]], leaving the empire to his adoptive son [[Marcus Aurelius|Marcus Aurelius (Antoninus)]], and the convoy arrived in 166, confusion remains about who sent the mission given that both Emperors were named 'Antoninus'.) The Roman mission came from the south (therefore probably by [[sea]]), entering China by the frontier of [[Jinan]] or [[Tonkin]]. It brought presents of [[rhinoceros]] [[horn (anatomy)|horn]]s, [[ivory]], and [[tortoise]] [[Animal shell|shell]], probably been acquired in [[Southern Asia]]. About the same time, and possibly through this embassy, the Chinese acquired a [[treatise]] of [[astronomy]] from the Romans. 

The existence of China was clearly known to Roman [[cartography|cartographers]] of the time, since its name and position is depicted in [[Ptolemy]]'s ''Geographia'', which is dated to c. [[150]]. On the map, China is located beyond the ''Aurea Chersonesus'' ("Golden [[Peninsula]]"), which refers to the [[Southeast Asia]]n peninsula. It is shown as being on the ''Magnus Sinus'' ("Great Gulf"), which presumably corresponds to the known areas of the [[China Sea]] at the time; although Ptolemy represents it as tending to the southeast rather than to the northeast. Trade throughout the [[Indian Ocean]] was extensive from the [[2nd century]], and many trading ports with links to Roman communities have been identified in [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]] along the route used by the Roman mission.

==Other Roman embassies==

[[Image:PtomelyAsiaDetail.jpg|thumb|300px|Detail of Asia in [[Ptolemy]]'s world map. Gulf of the [[Ganges]] left, Southeast Asian peninsula in the center, China Sea right, with "Sinae" (China).]]

Other embassies may have been sent after this first encounter, but were not recorded, until an account appears about presents sent in the early [[3rd century]] by the Roman Emperor to [[Cao Rui]] of the [[Kingdom of Wei]] (reigned [[227]]&ndash;[[239]])  in Northern China. The presents consisted of articles of glass in a variety of colours. While several [[Roman Emperors]] ruled during this time, the embassy, if genuine,  may have been sent by  [[Alexander Severus]]; since his successors reigned briefly and were busy with  civil wars. 

Another  embassy from Daqin is  recorded in the year [[284]], as bringing presents to the Chinese empire. This embassy presumably was sent by the Emperor [[Carus]] ([[282]]&ndash;[[283]]), whose short reign was occupied with war with [[Sassanid Dynasty|Persia]].
