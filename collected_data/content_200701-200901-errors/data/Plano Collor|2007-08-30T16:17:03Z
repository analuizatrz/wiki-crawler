The '''Plano Collor''' (Portuguese: '''Collor Plan''', after the name of the sponsoring [[President of Brazil|president]]) was officially called '''Plano Brasil Novo''' ('''New Brazil Plan'''), but the former name gained wide acceptance in the media and became the [[de facto]] name for a series of policies and procedures to control [[inflation]] in [[Brazil]] in [[1990]], during the [[President of Brazil|presidency]] of [[Fernando Collor de Mello]].

The Plano Collor was announced on [[March 15]] [[1990]] and had ambitious goals, such as putting the long-lasting [[economy|economic]] crisis to an end, bringing balance to the Brazilian economy and "elevating the country from the [[Third World|Third]] to the [[First World]]."

The existing currency, the [[Cruzado novo|cruzado novo]] was replaced by the 1986 [[Cruzeiro (monetary unit)|cruzeiro]] and a cap on bank account withdrawals was put in place. All Economic agents (such as individuals and corporations) were not allowed to withdraw more than [[Cruzeiro (monetary unit)|Cr$]] 50,000.00 from any bank account (be checking or investment) for a period of 18 months. This measure intended to meet the [[Monetarism|monetarist]] interpretation of inflation, artificially limiting the supply of (actually, the access to) money.

Shortly after taking office, Collor launched the ''Collor Plan'', implemented by his finance minister [[Zelia Cardoso de Mello]]. The Plan attempted to reduce the money supply by forcibly converting large portions of consumer bank accounts into non-cashable government bonds, while at the same time increasing the printing of money bills, a contradictory measure to combat [[hyper-inflation]]{{citequote|article}}. 

===Collor´s initiatives: privatization, free trade and the end of hyper-inflation===
Under Zélia´s tenure, Brasil had a period of major changes, featuring what [[ISTOÉ]] magazine called an "unprecedented" "revolution" <ref name="istoe">[http://www.terra.com.br/istoedinheiro/475/economia/zelia_esta_voltando.htm] "Revista Isto é"</ref> in many levels of public administration: "privatization, opening its market to free trade, encouraging industrial modernization, end of the hyper-inflation and public debt reduction."<ref name="scielo"> [http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0034-71402005000200001&script=sci_arttext]. "Scielo" </ref>.

In the month before Collor took power, the hyperinflation was 84 percent per month and growing. All accounts over 50,000 cruzeiros (about US$1,300 at that time), were frozen for 18 months. He also proposed freezes in wages and prices, as well as major cuts in government spending. The measures were received unenthusiastically by the people, though many felt that radical measures were necessary to kill the hyper-inflation which was above 50% monthly. Within a few months, however, inflation resumed, eventually reaching rates of 25% per month.

During the course of his government, Collor was accused of condoning an influence peddling scheme. The accusations weighed on the government and they lead Collor and his team to an institutional crisis leading to a loss of credibility that reached the finance minister Zélia <ref name="istoe"/>.

This political crisis had negative consequences on his ability to carry out his policies and reforms.<ref> [http://www.unopec.com.br/revistaintellectus/_Arquivos/Jan_Jul_04/PDF/Artigo_Rangel.pdf] </ref> The ''Plano Collor I'', under Zélia would be renewed with the implementation of the ''Plano Collor II''; the government's loss of prestige would make that follow-up plan short-lived and largely ineffective.<ref name="scielo"/>. The failure of Zélia and Plano Collor I led to their substitution by Marcílio Marques Moreira and his Plano Collor II. Moreira's plan tried to correct some aspects of the first plan, but was too late. The Collor government was paralyzed by the fast deterioration of Collor's image, through a succession of corruption accusations.<ref>[http://www.portal-rp.com.br/bibliotecavirtual/projetosdepesquisa/0153.pdf]</ref>

Although Zélia acknowledged later that the ''Plano Collor'' didn't end inflation, she also stated: ''"It is also possible to see with clarity that, under very difficult conditions, we promoted the equalization of the national debt --and that, together with the commercial opening, it created the basis for the implementation of the ''[[Plano Real]]''"''<ref name="istoe"/>. 

Collor´s neoliberal macroeconomic agenda was followed by his successors:<ref> [http://www.bbc.co.uk/portuguese/reporterbbc/story/2006/06/060626_lulafhcpimenta.shtml BBCBrasil, ''Lula segue política econômica de FHC, diz diretor do FMI''] {{pt icon}}</ref> Itamar Franco, Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Lula da Silva. Collor's administration privatized 15 different companies (including [[Acesita]], and began the process of privatization for others, such as [[Embraer]], [[Telebrás]] and [[Companhia Vale do Rio Doce]].<ref name="scielo"/> Professor Ricardo Antunes remembers Fernando Henriques´s speech when took over presidency: "FHC himself, on his speech, declared he would implement  Collor's economical program without his political adventurousness" <ref> [http://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/unicamp_hoje/ju/agosto2004/ju263pag11.html ''Jornal da Unicamp'', Ricardo Antunes esmiúça o receituário neoliberal] {{pt icon}}</ref>.

According to Philippe Faucher, professor of political science at [[McGill University]],<ref>[http://www.mcgill.ca/cdas/members/faucher/]</ref> the combination of the political crisis and the hyperinflation continued to decrease Collor's credibility and in that political vacuum an impeachment process took place, precipitated Pedro Collor's (Fernando Collor's brother) accusations and other social and political sectors which thought would be harmed by his policies. Faucher also analyses that ''Plan Real'' benefited from this political process as much as from the ''Plan Collor'' failures, and that both helped its stabilization process <ref>[http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0011-52581998000100001  ''Scielo'': Restaurando a Governabilidade: O Brasil (afinal) se Acertou?''] {{pt icon}}</ref>.

Inflation reached 50 percent per month by June [[1994]] and averaged 31.2 percent a month in 1994, for total of 2,294.0 percent that year; declined to monthly rates of between 1 and 3 percent in [[1995]], for an annual rate of 25.9 percent. In [[1996]]: 16.5 percent; [[1997]]: 7.2 percent. By [[2006]]: 3,18% annualy.
