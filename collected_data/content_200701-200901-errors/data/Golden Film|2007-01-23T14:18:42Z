The '''Golden Film''' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: '''Gouden Film''') is a [[film]] [[award]] recognising domestic [[box office]] achievements in the [[Netherlands]]. The Golden Film is awarded to [[Netherlands|Dutch]] film productions for the first 100,000 tickets sold. The award is an initiative by the [[Netherlands Film Festival]] and the [[Netherlands Film Fund]] to increase media attention for Dutch film productions. Critics of the award say that films selling as few tickets as the number needed to receive the Golden Film are not successful.

==Background==
The Golden Film is an initiative by the [[Netherlands Film Festival]] and the [[Netherlands Film Fund]] with the support of [[Film Investors Netherlands]]. The initiators wish to create more awareness for Dutch film productions in the Netherlands. It should bring good news about a film when the media attention for the film's release has stopped. The award is similar to the Golden Record already existing for the [[music industry]] in the Netherlands.<ref name="feest">{{cite web

The initiators use the terms ''number of visitors'' and ''tickets sold'' interchangeably.<ref name="film-fund-press-release"/> The number of visitors is based on box office information provided by the [[Netherlands Association of Film Distributors]] and the [[film distributor|distributor]] of the particular film.<ref>{{cite web

During the first years of the award, the public interest for Dutch film productions in the Netherlands increased. Within one and a half years a total of ten Golden Films were awarded. In 2003 the condition for the award was changed, according to the Netherlands Film Fund, to continue to stimulate the Dutch film industry. For all films released after [[January 1]], [[2003]], the Golden Film would be awarded for the first 100,000 visitors and the Platinum Film for 400,000 visitors.<ref name="film-fund-press-release"/> In 2005 the [[Crystal Film]] was introduced to award the first 10,000 visitors of a [[documentary film]].<ref name="crystal">{{cite web

The film ''[[Black Book (film)|Black Book]]'' (2006) received the Golden Film within four days after its release, which was at that time the shortest period for a film to receive the award.<ref name="zwartboek">{{cite web

Sometimes a producer asks for an extra trophy to be awarded to the lead [[actor]]s, representing the [[cast member|cast]], or the [[screenwriter]].<ref name="film-fund-press-release">{{cite press release

It happened some times that the producer asks to make extra trophies for example for the actors or the screenwriter."</ref>

==Response to the award==
Some people respond to the Golden film by saying that films selling as few tickets as the number needed to receive the Golden Film are not successful. In 2002, Ronald Ockhuysen wrote in a column about the Golden Film: "A good idea â€“ in itself. (...) 'A positive signal towards the people.' However it is doubtful that the mass grasps the signal. 75 thousand visitors is something meager, something poor. Especially when a film, like [[Full Moon Party (film)|Full Moon Party]], is made only for the mass. Johan Nijenhuis, the director of Full Moon Party, admitted outright that he sees only 300 thousand visitors as a failure."<ref name="feest"/> Dutch film producer [[Rob Houwer]] thinks the Golden Film is the prize for a [[failure|flop]]. In 2005, when the condition for the award had already been increased from 75,000 to 100,000 visitors, he said in an interview: "It is really nothing at all. A failure. Only from 350,000 cinema tickets sold it starts to look like something for a producer. It is incomprehensible that the media report about this prize. Why does everybody accept this nonsense?"<ref>{{cite web
