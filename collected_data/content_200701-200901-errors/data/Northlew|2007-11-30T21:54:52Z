'''Northlew''' is a [[village]] and [[civil parish]] in the [[West Devon]] [[district]] of the county of [[Devon]], [[England]], located at 50.77° N 4.12° W, [[British national grid reference system|UK National Grid]] reference SX5099.  The [[UK postcodes|post code]] for the village [[post office]] is EX20 3NZ. 

The village is approximately 7 miles (11Km) northwest of the town of [[Okehampton]], and most places in the village have excellent views over [[Dartmoor]].  The village is relatively isolated, not being served by any main roads.  It has an attractive main square surrounded by traditional buildings, some of them [[thatch]]ed; just off the square are a [[pub]], the local [[primary school]] and two churches, the [[Church of England]] parish church of [[Saint Thomas Becket]] and the [[Methodism|Methodist]] church (originally [[Bible Christian]]).  The [[ecclesiastical parish]] of Northlew has been combined with the neighbouring village of Ashbury, and since the school is a Church of England [[voluntary controlled school]], it bears the name of both villages.

Historically, Northlew formed part of [[Black Torrington]] [[Hundred (division)|Hundred]].  It gets its name from the ancient [[Manorialism|manor]] of Lew, mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]]; the village of [[Lewdown]] and the [[River Lew]] are nearby.  The village has the melancholy distinction of having lost the highest proportion of its enlisting population of any municipality in the [[United Kingdom]] during the [[First World War]]: of 100 men who enlisted in the forces, 24 died.  A stone memorial to them was recently erected in the churchyard, replacing wooden memorial tablets within the church.
