'''Neterkheperre-setepenamun Siamun''' was the sixth [[pharaoh]] of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] during the [[Twenty-first dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-first dynasty]]. He built extensively in Lower Egypt (for a king of the [[Third Intermediate Period]]) and is regarded as one of the most powerful rulers of this Dynasty after [[Psusennes I]]. 

==Monuments==
According to the French [[Egyptologist]] Nicolas Grimal, Siamun doubled the size of the Temple of Amun at Tanis. and initiated various works at the Temple of Horus at Mesen. He built at [[Heliopolis (ancient)|Heliopolis]] and at [[Piramesse]] where a surviving stone block bears his name. He also constructed and dedicated a new temple to Amun at Memphis with 6 stone columns and doorways  that bear his royal name. Finally, he bestowed numerous favours onto the Memphite Priests of Ptah. In Upper Egypt, he generally appears eponymously on a few Theban monuments although Siamun's High Priest of Amun at Thebes, Pinedjem II, organised the removal and re-burial of the [[New Kingdom]] royal mummies from the [[Valley of the Kings]] in several hidden mummy caches at Deir El-Bahari Tomb [[DB320]] for protection from looting. These activities were dated from Year 1 to Year 10 of Siamun's reign. 

One fragmentary but well known Triumphal relief scene from the Temple of Amun at Tanis depicts a king smiting his enemies with a mace. The king's name is explicitly given as '''[(Neterkheperre Setepenamun) Siamun, beloved of Am(un)]''' in the relief and there can be no doubt that this person was Siamun as the eminent British Egyptologist, [[Kenneth Kitchen]] stresses in his 2003 book, On the Reliability of the Old Testament.(p.109) Kitchen notes that Siamun appears "in typical pose brandishing a mace to strike down prisoners(?) now lost at the right except for two arms and hands, one of which grasps a remarkable double-bladed ax by its socket."(p.109) The writer also observes that this double bladed axe or 'halbread' has a flared crescent shaped blade which is close in form to the Aegean influenced double axe but is quite distinct from the Palestinian/Canaanite double headed axe which has a different shape that resembles an X. Thus, Kitchen concludes Siamun's foes were the Philistines who were descendants of the Aegean based Sea Peoples and that Siamun was commemorating his recent victory over them at Gezer by depicting himself in a formal battle scene relief at the Temple in Tanis.

==Foreign policy==
Under Siamun, Egypt embarked upon an active foreign policy and he is most probably the Pharaoh who formed an alliance with the new ruler of Israel, [[King Solomon]] against the Philistines. Solomon, the son of David, had just assumed power around 971 or 970 BCE which was certainly around the middle of Siamun's reign. As part of the arrangements within this Egyptian-Israelite alliance, the Egyptian king attacked and laid waste to the Philistine city of Gezer in part to safeguard Egypt's commercial ties with Phoenicia--something which the Philistines were threatening--and also to take advantage of the Philistines' momentary weakness after [[King David]]'s series of Biblical wars against their state. Solomon, for his part, was then permitted to permanently secure his kingdom's southern borders by occupying Gezer, which henceforth, remained a part of [[Ancient Israel]]. The alliance was consecrated by a royal marriage between Solomon and a daughter of the Egyptian king. ('''I Kings 9:16''')

==Reign Length==
Siamun was erroneously credited with a reign of only 9 Years by [[Manetho]], a figure which is now universally amended to 19 Years by all scholars on the basis of a Year 17 I Shemu day [lost] inscription in fragment 3B, lines 3-15 dated to Siamun from the Karnak Priestly Annals. It records the induction of Hori, son of Nespaneferhor into the Priesthood at Karnak. Siamun's prenomen, Neterkheperre-Setepenamun, means "Like a God is The Manifestation of Re, Chosen of Amun."
