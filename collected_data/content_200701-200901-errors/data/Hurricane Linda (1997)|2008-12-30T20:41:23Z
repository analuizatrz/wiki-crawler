'''Hurricane Linda''' was the strongest [[Pacific hurricane]] on record. Forming on September&nbsp;9, 1997 from a [[tropical wave]], Linda steadily intensified and reached hurricane status within 36&nbsp;hours of developing. Subsequently, it [[rapid deepening|rapidly intensified]], reaching winds of 185&nbsp;[[miles per hour|mph]] (295&nbsp;[[kilometres per hour|km/h]]) and an estimated central pressure of 902&nbsp;[[bar (unit)|millibars]] (26.65&nbsp;[[Inch of mercury|inches of mercury]]). The hurricane was briefly forecast to move toward southern California, although it turned out to sea and dissipated on September&nbsp;17. It was the fifteenth [[tropical cyclone]], thirteenth named storm, seventh hurricane, and fifth [[tropical cyclone scales|major hurricane]] of the [[1997 Pacific hurricane season]].

While near peak intensity, Hurricane Linda passed near the unpopulated [[Socorro Island]], where it damaged meteorological instruments. The hurricane produced high waves along the southwestern Mexican coastline, which forced the closure of five ports. When Linda was predicted to make [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] on California, it would have been the first to do so since a [[1939 California tropical storm|storm in 1939]]. Although it did not hit the state, the hurricane produced light to moderate rainfall across the region, causing mudslides and flooding in the [[San Gorgonio Wilderness]]; two houses were destroyed and 77&nbsp;others were damaged, and damage totaled $3.2&nbsp;million (1997&nbsp;[[United States Dollar|USD]], $4.3&nbsp;million 2008&nbsp;USD). Despite the intensity, the name was not [[list of retired Pacific hurricane names|retired]].

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Linda 1997 track.png}}
The origins of Hurricane Linda are believed to have been in a [[tropical wave]] which moved off the coast of Africa on August&nbsp;24&mdash;a tropical wave is an elongated [[low pressure area]] embedded within the easterly [[trade wind]]s. The wave tracked westward across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and [[Caribbean Sea]] without [[tropical cyclogenesis|development]]. An area of [[convection (meteorology)|convection]], or thunderstorms, developed to the west of [[Panama]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]] on September&nbsp;6, believed to have been related to the tropical wave. The broad system continued generally westward, and within three days of entering the basin a poorly-defined [[Atmospheric circulation|circulation]] formed. [[Tropical cyclone#structure|Banding features]] developed, and at around 1200&nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] on September&nbsp;9 the system organized into Tropical Depression Fourteen-E, about 460&nbsp;mi (745&nbsp;km) south of the Mexican city of [[Manzanillo, Colima|Manzanillo]].<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=Max Mayfield|date=1997-10-25|title=Hurricane Linda Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|accessdate=2008-12-25|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1997linda.html}}</ref>

Upon becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression was moving northwestward at 6&ndash;12&nbsp;[[Miles per hour|mph]] (9&ndash;19&nbsp;[[Kilometres per hour|km/h]]), partially under the influence of a [[Earth's atmosphere#Temperature and layers|mid- to upper-level]] [[low pressure area|low]] near the southern tip of the [[Baja California peninsula]]. Deep convection and banding features increased, and the depression intensified into a tropical storm early on September&nbsp;10; at that time, the cyclone was [[list of tropical cyclone names|named]] Linda by the [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC). As upper-level [[outflow (meteorology)|outflow]] became well-established, the storm began to strengthen more quickly. By September&nbsp;11, an intermittent [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] appeared, by which time the NHC estimated Linda to have reached hurricane status. Subsequently Linda began to [[rapid deepening|rapidly intensify]]; its small eye became well-defined and surrounded by very cold convection.<ref name="tcr"/> In a 24&nbsp;hour period, the minimum [[Atmospheric pressure|pressure]] dropped 81&nbsp;[[bar (unit)|mbar]] (2.39&nbsp;[[Inch of mercury|inHg]]), or an average drop of 3.38&nbsp;mbar (0.1&nbsp;inHg) per hour; this intensification met the criterion for [[rapid deepening|explosive deepening]], which is an average hourly pressure decrease of at least 2.5&nbsp;mbar (0.07&nbsp;inHg).<ref>{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|date=2007-09-10|title=Glossary of NHC terms|accessdate=2008-12-25|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutgloss.shtml}}</ref> By early on September&nbsp;12, Hurricane Linda reached [[List of Category 5 Pacific hurricanes|Category 5]] status on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Saffir-Simpson scale]], and around 0600&nbsp;UTC attained estimated peak winds of 185&nbsp;mph (295&nbsp;km/h) about 145&nbsp;mi (235&nbsp;km) southeast of [[Socorro Island]].<ref name="tcr"/> Its [[maximum sustained wind]]s were estimated from 180&ndash;195&nbsp;mph (290&ndash;315&nbsp;km/h), based on using the [[Dvorak technique]],<ref name="tcr"/> and gusts in the hurricane were estimated to have reached 218&nbsp;mph (353&nbsp;km/h).<ref name="wrh">{{cite web|author=San Diego National Weather Service|date=January 2007|title=A History of Significant Weather Events in Southern California|accessdate=2008-12-26|url=http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/sgx/document/weatherhistory.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> Also, its pressure is estimated at 902&nbsp;mbar (26.65&nbsp;inHg), making Linda the most intense Pacific hurricane on record;<ref name="tcr"/> when the storm was active, its pressure was estimated to have been slightly lower at 900&nbsp;mbar (26.58&nbsp;inHg).<ref name="wm">{{cite web|author=Jesse Ferrell|year=1997|title=Hurricane Linda: History in the Making|publisher=Central Atlantic Storm Investigators|accessdate=2008-12-26|url=http://www.weathermatrix.net/tropical/1997/linda/}}</ref>

Two days later it weakened to tropical depression status, when located about 1,105&nbsp;mi (1,785&nbsp;km) west of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. By September&nbsp;18, Linda no longer met the criteria for a tropical cyclone, although a circulation persisted for a few days before dissipating.<ref name="tcr"/>

Forecasters and computer models did not anticipate how quickly Linda would strengthen; in one advisory, the NHC under-forecast how strong the winds would be in 72&nbsp;hours by 115&nbsp;mph (185&nbsp;km/h).<ref>{{cite journal|author=Kevin R.

Hurricane Linda occurred about a month after the similarly powerful [[Hurricane Guillermo (1997)|Hurricane Guillermo]], which also reached Category&nbsp;5 status. The passage of Linda cooled the waters in the region, causing [[Hurricane Nora (1997)|Hurricane Nora]] to weaken when it passed through the area on September&nbsp;21.<ref name="mwr"/>

==Preparations, impact and records==
{{Category 5 Pacific hurricanes|align=right}}
While Hurricane Linda did not make [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]], it passed near the unpopulated [[Socorro Island]] when its winds were near their peak intensity.<ref name="mwr"/> The hurricane cut the power to all wind and pressure instruments.<ref name="tcr"/> A station on the island recorded a pressure of 986&nbsp;mbar (29.12&nbsp;inHg) before it stopped producing observations.<ref name="wm"/> No [[Tropical cyclone warnings and watches|tropical cyclone warnings or watches]] were issued for the hurricane;<ref name="tcr"/> however, the threat for high tides and strong winds in Mexico prompted officials to issue coastal flood warnings and close five ports. Waves up to 7.8&nbsp;ft (2.4&nbsp;m) were reported along the coastline, causing flooding in the [[Political divisions of Mexico|states]] of [[Michoacán]], [[Jalisco]], [[Nayarit]], and [[Sinaloa]].<ref name="r914">{{cite news|author=Staff Writer|publisher=Reuters|date=1997-09-14|title=Hurricane hits Mexican ports, may be headed to California|accessdate=2008-12-27}}</ref>

When Linda was predicted to execute its turn to the northeast, it was forecast to move ashore in [[Southern California]] as a weak tropical storm; this would have made Linda the first to do so since a [[1939 California tropical storm|tropical storm]] struck the state in 1939.<ref name="wrh"/> The [[Oxnard, California]] [[National Weather Service]] office issued public information and special weather statements which discussed the possible impact of Linda on southern California. Those advisories mentioned forecasting uncertainty also advised the media not to over-exaggerate the storm.<ref name="tcr"/> The office noted a threat for significant rainfall, possibly causing [[flash flood]]ing, as well as high surf.<ref name="wm"/> To prepare for possible flooding, workers cleaned storm drains and prepared sandbags for coastal properties.<ref>{{cite news|author=Steve Schmidt|date=1997-09-15|title=Fears ease as Pacific hurricane veers off|publisher=Copley News Service|accessdate=2008-12-27}}</ref>

Although Linda did not make landfall, 15&ndash;18&nbsp;ft (4.5&ndash;5.5&nbsp;m) waves reached the southern California coastline.<ref name="wrh"/> In [[Newport Beach, California|Newport Beach]], a wave swept five people off a [[jetty]] and carried them 900&nbsp;ft (1450&nbsp;m) out to sea, although all were rescued by a passing boat.<ref>{{cite web|author=San Diego National Weather Service|date=2007-11-20|title=Day in Weather History: September 14|accessdate=2008-12-26|url=http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/sgx/document/Dayinhistory/dayhistory0914.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> Moisture from the hurricane moved across the state, producing heavy rainfall as well as golfball-sized [[hail]]. A station in Forrest Falls located within the [[San Gorgonio Wilderness]] recorded rainfall rates of 2.5&nbsp;in (64&nbsp;mm). The rainfall caused severe flooding and mudslides which destroyed two houses, damaged 77&nbsp;others, and left $3.2&nbsp;million in damage (1997&nbsp;[[United States Dollar|USD]], $4.3&nbsp;million 2008&nbsp;USD).<ref name="wrh"/> San Diego recorded 0.05&nbsp;in (1.3&nbsp;mm) of rain, the first measurable precipitation in 164&nbsp;days; this tied the record for the longest duration without rainfall at the station, previously set in 1915 and 1924. Moisture from Linda spread further inland into the [[Upper Midwest]], contributing to a record daily rainfall total of 1.97&nbsp;in (50&nbsp;mm) in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]].<ref>{{cite web|author=National Agricultural Statistics Service|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|date=1997-09-23|title=Weekly Weather and Crop Bulletin|accessdate=2008-12-27|url=http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/usda/waob/weather_weekly//1990s/1997/weather_weekly-09-23-1997.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>

With an estimated pressure of 902&nbsp;mbar (26.64&nbsp;inHg), Hurricane Linda became the most intense Pacific hurricane since reliable records began in [[1966 Pacific hurricane season|1966]], with the advent of routine satellite coverage.<ref name="tcr"/> It is also believed to have been the strongest since overall records began in the basin in 1949.<ref name="mwr"/> The previous most intense hurricane was [[Hurricane Ava (1973)|Hurricane Ava]] in 1973, which had a measured pressure of 915&nbsp;mbar (27.02&nbsp;inHg). As no observations recorded the pressure during Linda's peak, its peak intensity was estimated; thus, Ava remains the strongest measured hurricane in the basin.<ref name="hurdat">{{cite web|author=Hurricane Research Division|year=2008|title=Eastern North Pacific Hurricane Best Track File 1949-2007|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=2008-12-26|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/tracks1949to2007_epa.txt}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Miles B.

Hurricane Linda maintained [[List of Category 5 Pacific hurricanes|Category 5]] status on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Saffir-Simpson scale]], with winds of over 155&nbsp;mph (250&nbsp;km/h), for 42&nbsp;consecutive hours.

Linda is one of only 12&nbsp;[[Pacific hurricane]]s to reach Category&nbsp;5 status.<ref name="hurdat"/>

Because Linda caused little damage, the name was not [[list of retired Pacific hurricane names|retired]] by the [[World Meteorological Organization]]. It was used during the [[2003 Pacific hurricane season|2003 season]], and is scheduled to be used again during the 2009 season.<ref name="names">{{cite web|title=Worldwide Tropical Cyclone Names|year=2007|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-01-21|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutnames.shtml}}</ref>
