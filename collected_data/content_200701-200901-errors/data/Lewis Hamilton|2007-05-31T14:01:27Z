'''Lewis Carl Hamilton''' (born [[January 7]] [[1985]] in [[Stevenage]], [[Hertfordshire]], [[England]]) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] Formula One [[racing driver]] who currently drives for the [[McLaren|McLaren Mercedes]] team. 

After finishing in second place at the [[2007 Spanish Grand Prix]], he became the youngest driver ever to lead the [[F1]] drivers' championship, beating the record held since 1960 by [[Bruce McLaren]]. He also holds the record of being the only driver ever to finish in the top three in all of his first five Grands Prix and the only newcomer to have led the championship.   

==Personal and early life==
Hamilton's [[paternal]] grandparents emigrated to the [[United Kingdom]] from [[Grenada]] in the 1950s. His grandfather worked on the [[London Underground]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Grenadian roots of first black F1 driver |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/caribbean/news/story/2006/11/061127_grenadaf1.shtml |date=[[2006-11-27]] |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=2006-12-12}}</ref>  His mother, and father Anthony who named Lewis after the US Olympic gold medal winning athlete [[Carl Lewis]],<ref>Sourced from [[ITV]]'s 2007 Bahrain Grand Prix commentary</ref> separated when Lewis was two. Lewis grew up with his father, step-mother and half-brother <ref name=zooref>Zoo: Issue 162, 30 March-4 April 2007</ref> Nicholas who suffers from [[cerebral palsy]] . At six, he began his racing career when Anthony bought Lewis his first go-kart. He held down three jobs to support Lewis' career and still found enough time to attend all of Lewis' races.<ref name=zooref /> When he was 11, Lewis approached [[Ron Dennis]] and told him, ''"I'm going to race for you one day...I'm going to race for McLaren"'' and was soon signed to [[Team McLaren|McLaren]]'s development programme,<ref name=zooref /> while still attending [[The John Henry Newman School]]. In early 2007, Hamilton moved from [[Tewin|Tewin Wood]] in [[Hertfordshire]] to [[Woking]] in [[Surrey]] to be closer to the [[Mclaren F1|McLaren]] factory. <!--The Daily Mirror reported in March 2007 that he was dating a college girl called Jodia.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hamilton in love with college girl|publisher=[[Daily Mirror]] |url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/topstories/tm_method=full%26objectid=18768228%26siteid=89520-name_page.html}}</ref>-->

==Racing career==
===Pre-Formula One===
====Karting====
Hamilton began karting in 1993 at the age of eight,<ref name="hamiltonf1fbio"> {{cite web | title = Who's Who: Lewis Hamilton | publisher = F1Fanatic.co.uk | date = 2006 | url = http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/whos-who/whos-who-h/lewis-hamilton/ | accessdate =2006-12-02}}{{Verify credibility}}</ref> and quickly began winning races and championships.

He progressed through the Cadet (1995-6), Junior Yamaha (1997), Junior Intercontinental A (1998-9), Intercontinental A (1999), Formula A (2000) and Formula Super A (2001) ranks in seven seasons, becoming European Champion in 2000 with maximum points. In [[Formula A]] and [[Formula Super A]], racing for TeamMBM.com, his team mate was current Williams driver [[Nico Rosberg]].

Following his karting successes, the [[British Racing Drivers' Club]] made him a ‘Rising Star’ Member in 2000.<ref name="hamiltonf1fbio" />

====Junior Formulas====

Hamilton began his car racing career in the 2001 British Formula Renault Winter Series, finishing fifth overall.<ref name="hamiltonf1fbio" /> This led to a full 2002 [[Formula Renault#United Kingdom|Formula Renault UK]] campaign with Manor Motorsport. Hamilton finished third overall with three wins and three pole positions.<ref name="hamiltonf1fbio" /> He remained with Manor for another year and won the championship convincingly with ten wins, beating Alex Lloyd with 419 points to 377.<ref name="hamiltonf1fbio" /> But his début appearance in British Formula Three was less successful – Hamilton crashed out of both races at the Brands Hatch season finale, being taken to hospital after the second.<ref name="hamiltonf1fbio" /> He did show his speed at both the [[Macau Grand Prix|Macau]] and Korean Grand Prix. In the latter he qualified on pole position in his first visit to the Korean track and in only his fourth race outing in a F3 car.

Hamilton and Manor then made their debut in the [[2004]] [[Formula Three Euroseries]]. They won just one race and Hamilton was fifth in the championship. He also won the Bahrain F3 Superprix, race one of the [[Macau Grand Prix|Macau F3 Grand Prix]], and had his first test in a McLaren F1 car in December<ref name="hamiltonf1fbio" /> that year. He defected to reigning Euroseries champions ASM for the 2005 season and dominated the championship, winning 15 of the 20 rounds. He also won the [[Ultimate Masters of Formula 3]] at [[Circuit Park Zandvoort|Zandvoort]].<ref name="hamiltonf1fbio" />

After the season, British magazine ''[[Autosport]]'' featured him in their “Top 50 Drivers of 2005” issue, ranking Hamilton 24th.<ref name="hamiltonf1fbio" /> This success led him to join [[ART Grand Prix]] for the [[2006 GP2 Series season]]. Like ASM in F3, ART were the class of the field and reigning champions having taken the 2005 GP2 crown with [[Nico Rosberg]].<ref name="hamiltonf1fbio" />

Despite stiff opposition from rivals who had raced in the GP2 series during 2005, such as team mate [[Alexandre Prémat]] and [[Nelson Angelo Piquet]], Lewis won the GP2 championship at his first attempt. Among his notable performances was a dominant win at the fifth round held at the [[Nürburgring]], which he won despite serving a penalty for speeding in the [[pit lane]].<ref name="hamiltonf1fbio" />

At his home race at [[Silverstone]], supporting the [[British Grand Prix]], he impressed again by overtaking two rivals at Becketts, a series of high-speed (up to 150&nbsp;mph in a GP2 car) bends where overtaking is rare. He demonstrated his overtaking prowess again at the race in Istanbul, when he recovered from a spin that left him 18th, to take second place in the final corners. He became GP2 champion in unusual circumstances. [[Giorgio Pantano]] won the penultimate race at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]], and set the fastest lap on the final lap, initially taking this bonus point from Hamilton. However, it transpired that he had set this under a yellow flag, indicating to the officials that he had not slowed enough to avoid potential danger, leading to him losing the fastest lap, which therefore gave Hamilton the single point he needed to clinch the title.<ref name="hamiltonf1fbio" />

===Formula One===
{{seealso|McLaren}}

[[Image:Lewis Hamilton 2007.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Hamilton driving for [[McLaren]] at the [[2007 Malaysian Grand Prix]].]]

Hamilton introduced himself to [[McLaren]] team boss [[Ron Dennis]] at the 1994 [[Autosport]] Awards,<ref name="hamiltonf1fbio" /> asking if he could drive for the team in the future.

In 1998 he was signed to the McLaren driver development support programme, the contract including a future option of an F1 seat, making 13-year-old Hamilton the youngest ever driver to secure a F1 contract.<ref name="hamiltonf1fbio" />

His 2006 GP2 championship coincided with a vacancy at McLaren following the departure of [[Juan Pablo Montoya]] to [[NASCAR]] and [[Kimi Räikkönen]] to [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]].<ref name="hamiltonf1fbio" />
[[Image:Luis Hamilton Sepang.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Hamilton finished second in Malaysia, making it two podiums from two starts.]]
After months of speculation on whether Lewis, [[Pedro de la Rosa]], [[Gary Paffett]] or even former World Champion [[Mika Häkkinen]] would drive for McLaren alongside defending champion [[Fernando Alonso]] for the [[2007 Formula One season]], Lewis was confirmed as the team's second driver to the amazement of many F1 insiders who considered that the more experienced [[Gary Paffett]] was more qualified for a race seat.<ref>{{cite news| title = Lewis Hamilton joins Formula 1 World Champion Fernando Alonso at Vodafone McLaren Mercedes| publisher = mclaren.com| url = http://www.mclaren.com/mediaroom/information/pressreleases/lewis_hamilton.php| date = [[2006-11-24]]| accessdate = 2006-11-24}}</ref> He was told of McLaren’s decision on [[September 30]], but the news was not made public until [[November 24]], for fear that it would be overshadowed by [[Michael Schumacher]]’s retirement announcement.<ref name="hamiltonf1fbio" />

Hamilton is the first driver of African or Caribbean ancestry to compete in F1,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sport.independent.co.uk/motor_racing/article2013302.ece |title= Hamilton's F1 drive is a dream come true |author=David Tremayne |date=[[2006-11-25]] |accessdate=2006-11-25 |publisher=[[The Independent]]}}</ref> although [[Willy T.

On his début at the [[2007 Australian Grand Prix]], he qualified fourth on the grid and finished third in the race, the thirteenth driver to finish on the podium on his GP début<ref>{{cite web | title = Hamilton makes history | publisher = F1Fanatic.co.uk | date = 2007 | url = http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/2007/03/18/hamilton-makes-history/ | accessdate = 2007-03-22}}</ref> (excluding those in the first ever World Championship round), the last being {{F1|1997}} World Champion [[Jacques Villeneuve]] 11 years earlier. At the [[2007 Bahrain Grand Prix|Bahrain GP]], Hamilton got his first front-row start qualifying second to the Ferrari driver [[Felipe Massa]], who won the race comfortably. Hamilton also finished second in the [[2007 Spanish Grand Prix|Spanish Grand Prix]], again behind a dominant Massa, to take the lead in the drivers championship.<ref name="bahrain07">{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/6557493.stm|title=Massa holds off battling Hamilton|accessyear=2007|accessmonthday=April 15|publisher=BBC Sport|year=2007}}</ref> With that achievement, Hamilton surpassed Bruce McLaren to become the youngest driver to ever lead the world championship.<ref name="Spain07">{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailyf1news.com/dailyf1news/nieuw/artikel.php?nwsID=3176|title=Race notes: Spanish GP|accessyear=2007|accessmonthday=May 13|publisher=Daily F1 News|year=2007}}</ref>

After his record-breaking start, Lewis was widely praised by the British media and [[Frank Williams]] describing him as "superhuman".  Triple world champions [[Jackie Stewart]] and [[Niki Lauda]] have speculated that he could win the 2007 championship. Ex-[[Jordan Grand Prix|Jordan]] owner [[Eddie Jordan]], however, disagrees and believes that Lewis Hamilton won't win the championship. [[McLaren]] CEO [[Martin Whitmarsh]] has said that he has the potential to become the greatest F1 driver ever.<ref>{{cite news| title =F1 praise 'superhuman' Hamilton.

{{Trivia}}
Hamilton is to take part in the 2007 [[Goodwood Festival of Speed]]. [http://www.goodwood.co.uk/info/pn/FOSEN_view.asp?ID=2049]

After the [[2007 Monaco Grand Prix]], McLaren denied favouring double world champion [[Fernando Alonso]] after Lewis Hamilton suggested he had been forced into a supporting role. Bookmakers [[Paddy Power]] decided to refund bets placed on Hamilton after the controversy.
