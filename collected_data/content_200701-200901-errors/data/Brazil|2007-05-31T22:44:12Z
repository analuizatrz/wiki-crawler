==History==
{{main|History of Brazil}}

===The first Brazilians===
{{main|Indigenous peoples of Brazil}}

The territory of Brazil has been inhabited for at least 8,000 years. The origins of the first Brazilians, who were called "Indians" (''índios'') by the Portuguese, are still a matter of dispute among archaeologists. The traditional view is that they were part of the first wave of migrant hunters who came into the [[Americas]] from [[Siberia]], across the [[Bering Strait]]. However some archaeologists see signs of a much older human population, morphologically distinct from the Asian hunters and more similar to [[Africa]]n and [[Australian Aborigine|Australian]] natives, who were displaced or absorbed by the Siberian hunters. [[Image:Brazil-16-map.jpg|thumb|right|Map of Brazil issued by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[explorer]]s in 1519.]]

===Colonial Brazil===
{{main|Colonial Brazil}}

It is generally accepted that Brazil was first discovered by Europeans on [[April 22]], [[1500]], by [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]], though this is [[Controversies about the discovery of Brazil|contested by some]]. 
Until 1530 Portugal had little interest in Brazil, mainly due to the high profits gained through commerce with [[Indochina]]. This lack of interest led to several "invasions" by different countries, and the Portuguese Crown devised a system to effectively occupy Brazil, without paying the costs. Through the [[Hereditary Captaincies]] system, Brazil was divided into strips of land that were donated to Portuguese noblemen, who were in turn responsible for the occupation of the land and answered to the king.  Later, the Portuguese realized the system was a failure (only two lots were successfully occupied) and took control of the failed lots.<ref>[http://www.fundacaooscaramericano.org.br/eng/Collection/Colonial_Brazil/colonial_brazil.html Colonial Brazil] Fundação Oscar Americano</ref><ref>[http://www.casahistoria.net/Brazil.htm#Colonial_Brazil Colonial Brazil] CasaHistória</ref>

===The Empire of Brazil===
{{main|Brazilian War of Independence|Empire of Brazil}}

The most interesting feature in the history of Brazil is the fact that it was one of only two countries among the ‘new worlds’ that housed an effective legal monarchical state (the other was [[Empire of Mexico|Mexico]]), for a period of almost 90 years; and for a period of 13 years was the metropolis of a European state. This was the case that Brazil’s capital city — [[Rio de Janeiro]] — was from 1808 to 1821 the head of the [[Portuguese empire]], which spread from Europe to Asia and Africa.
In 1808, the Portuguese court, fleeing from [[Napoleon]]’s troops which had invaded the territory of Portugal, moved aboard a large fleet, escorted by [[United Kingdom|British]] men-of-war, with all the government apparatus to its then-colony, Brazil, establishing themselves in the city of Rio de Janeiro. From there the Portuguese king ruled his huge empire for 13 years, and there he would have remained for the rest of his life if it were not for the turmoil aroused in Portugal due, among other reasons, to his long stay in Brazil after the end of Napoleon's reign.[[Image:Fala do trono.jpg|thumb|right|Emperor Dom [[Pedro II of Brazil]], 1873.]]<ref>[http://www.casahistoria.net/Brazil.htm#Independence Indenpendece and Empire] CasaHistória</ref>

===The Old Republic===
{{main|History of Brazil (1889–1930)}}

Pedro II was deposed on [[15 November]], [[1889]]<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+br0022) The Republican Era, 1889-1985]</ref> by a Republican military coup led by general [[Deodoro da Fonseca]], who became the country’s first ''de facto'' president through military ascension.  The country’s name became the ''Republic of the United States of Brazil'' (which in 1967 was changed to ''Federative Republic of Brazil'').  From 1889 to 1930, the government was a constitutional democracy, with the presidency alternating between the dominant states of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] and [[Minas Gerais]].<ref>[http://www.casahistoria.net/Brazil.htm#Republic_1889-1964 Republic] CasaHistória</ref><ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+br0022) The Era of Getúlio Vargas, 1930-54]</ref>

===Populism and development===
{{main|History of Brazil (1930–1945)|History of Brazil (1945–1964)}}

A [[military junta]] took control in 1930. Getúlio Vargas took power soon after that, and would remain as dictatorial ruler (with a brief democratic period), until his suicide in 1954. After 1930, the successive governments continued industrial and agriculture growth and development of the vast interior of Brazil.<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+br0022) The Era of Getúlio Vargas, 1930-54]</ref>

Provisional President Getúlio Dorneles Vargas ruled as dictator (1930–1934), congressionally elected president (1934–1937), and again dictator (1937–1945), with the backing of his revolutionary coalition.  He also served as a senator (1946–1951) and the popularly elected president (1951–1954).<ref>[http://www.casahistoria.net/Brazil.htm#Republic_1889-1964 Republic] CasaHistória</ref>

Vargas was a member of the ''[[gaucho]]'' landed oligarchy and had risen through the system of patronage and clientelism, but he had a fresh vision of how Brazilian politics could be shaped to support national development. He understood that with the breakdown of direct relations between workers and owners in the expanding factories of Brazil, workers could become the basis for a new form of political power—[[populism]]. Using such insights, he would gradually establish such mastery over the Brazilian political world that he would stay in power for fifteen years.

Vargas was responsible for the entry of Brazil into the [[World War II|Second World War]] on the side of the Allies.<ref>[http://www.casahistoria.net/Brazil.htm#Republic_1889-1964 Republic] CasaHistória</ref>

===Military Dictatorship===
{{main|History of Brazil (1964–1985)}}

The [[military]] maintained power in Brazil from 1964 until March 1985 because of political struggles within the regime and Brazilian elite. Although most historians state that the coup was merely a consequence of the regime's behavior in the final years, others argue that the coup had been planned since 1954.  Just as the Brazilian regime changes of 1889, 1930, and 1945 unleashed competing political forces and caused divisions within the military, so too did the regime change of 1964.<ref>[http://www.casahistoria.net/Brazil.htm#Military_Rule Military Rule] CasaHistória</ref>

===Redemocratization to Present===
{{main|History of Brazil (1985–present)}}

[[Tancredo Neves]] was elected president in an indirect election in 1985 as the nation returned to civilian rule. He died before being sworn in, and the elected vice president, [[José Sarney]], was sworn in as president in his place. [[Fernando Collor de Mello]] was the first elected president by popular vote after the military regime in December 1989.  In September 1992 Collor was impeached for corruption. Acting president [[Itamar Franco]] was sworn in as president. In elections held on [[October 3]], [[1994]], [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]] was elected president. Reelected in 1998, he guided Brazil through a wave of financial crises. In 2000, Cardoso ordered the declassifying of some military files concerning [[Operation Condor]], a network of South American military dictatorships that kidnapped and assassinated political opponents.
 
Brazil’s most severe problem today is arguably its highly unequal distribution of wealth and income, one of the most extreme in the world. By the 1990s, more than one out of four Brazilians continued to survive on less than one dollar a day. These socio-economic contradictions helped elect [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] in 2002.

== Government ==

The Brazilian Federation is based on the indissoluble association of three autonomous political entities: the States, the Municipalities and the Federal District. <ref> Brazilian Federal Constitution, article 1 [http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constituiçao.htm "Constituição Federal"], Brazilian Government (official text). Accessed May 17, 2007. </ref> A fourth entity is originated in the aforementioned association: the Union. <ref> Brazilian Federal Constitution, article 18 [http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constituiçao.htm "Constituição Federal"], Brazilian Government (official text). Accessed May 17, 2007. </ref> There is no hierarchy among the political entities. The Federation is set on five fundamental principles: <ref> Brazilian Federal Constitution, article 1, I, II, III, IV, V [http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constituiçao.htm "Constituição Federal"], Brazilian Government (official text). Accessed May 17, 2007. </ref> [[sovereignty]], [[citizenship]], [[dignity]] of the people, social value of [[labor]], freedom of [[enterprise]], and [[political pluralism]].

The classic tripartite division of power, encompassing the [[Executive]], [[Legislative]] and [[Judiciary]] branches under the [[checks and balances]] system, is formally established by the Constitution. <ref> Brazilian Federal Constitution, article 2 [http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constituiçao.htm "Constituição Federal"], Brazilian Government (official text). Accessed May 17, 2007. </ref> The Executive and Legislative are organized independently in all four political entities, whilst the Judiciary is organized only in the Federal and State levels.

=== Executive Branch ===
[[Image:Lula117947.jpeg|thumb|right|Brazil's current [[President of Brazil|president]], [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]].]]

Practically all governmental and administrative functions are exercised by [[authorities]] and [[agencies]] affiliated with the Executive. The [[form of government]] is [[Republican]] and [[democratic]], <ref> Brazilian Federal Constitution, article 1 [http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constituiçao.htm "Constituição Federal"], Brazilian Government (official text).

Accessed May 17, 2007. </ref> 

[[Governors]] head the government in States and the Federal District, whilst [[Mayors]] are responsible for the government of Municipalities. Governors and Mayors are assisted by [[Secretaries]].

=== Legislative Branch ===
[[Image:National Congress of Brazil.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Congresso Nacional|National Congress]] in [[Brasília]], the [[capital]] of Brazil.]]

Legislative houses in each political entity are the main source of laws in Brazil. The [[National Congress of Brazil|National Congress]] is the Union’s Legislative. It is a [[bicameral]] house formed by the [[Chamber of Deputies]] and the [[Senate of Brazil|Federal Senate]]. [[Deputies]] are elected every four years in a system of proportional representation, and represent the people. <ref> Brazilian Federal Constitution, article 45 [http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constituiçao.htm "Constituição Federal"], Brazilian Government (official text). Accessed May 17, 2007. </ref>  [[Senators]] are elected for eight-year terms, and represent the interests of the States. <ref> Brazilian Federal Constitution, article 46[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constituiçao.htm "Constituição Federal"], Brazilian Government (official text). Accessed May 17, 2007. </ref> 

The ordinary law making process is described in detail by the Federal Constitution. <ref> Brazilian Federal Constitution, articles 59-69[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constituiçao.htm "Constituição Federal"], Brazilian Government (official text). Accessed May 17, 2007. </ref>  The Executive participates by analyzing and eventually vetoing laws before they are formally enacted. Vetoes can be overturned by the Legislative. On certain matters, the Executive and Judiciary authorities may have exclusive prerogatives for legislative initiative.

In the States and Municipalities the Legislative is organized in unicameral houses named, respectively, [[Legislative Assemblies]] and [[Municipal Chambers]].

Legislative houses may pass legal judgment in exceptional cases, <ref> Brazilian Federal Constitution, article 52[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constituiçao.htm "Constituição Federal"], Brazilian Government (official text). Accessed May 17, 2007. </ref>  and have administrative functions related to their [[personnel]]. 

=== Judiciary Branch ===
[[Image:STF.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Supreme Federal Tribunal]] interior during trial.]]

Judiciary authorities exercise [[jurisdiction|jurisdictional]] duties almost exclusively. They can also enact laws related to internal court proceedings. <ref> Brazilian Federal Constitution, article 96, I, ''a'' [http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constituiçao.htm "Constituição Federal"], Brazilian Government (official text). Accessed May 17, 2007. </ref>  Also, the Judiciary has administrative functions regarding its personnel.

The Union’s Judiciary relates to the Federal Justice system. States have their own Justice system, <ref> Brazilian Federal Constitution, articles 125 and 126[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constituiçao.htm "Constituição Federal"], Brazilian Government (official text). Accessed May 17, 2007. </ref>  and so does the Federal District. Municipalities rely upon the State or Federal Justice depending on the lawsuit nature. Both the Federal and State Justice systems are interconnected when appeals reach Higher courts. By historical tradition Brazilian Justice is also divided according to the specialized courts, so there are also labor, military and election courts. <ref> Brazilian Federal Constitution, article 92[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constituiçao.htm "Constituição Federal"], Brazilian Government (official text). Accessed May 17, 2007. </ref>   

=== Politics ===
{{main|Politics of Brazil}}<!--Please add new information to relevant articles of the series-->

Democracy was re-established in Brazil when the current Federal Constitution was promulgated. The President, Governors and Mayors are elected by direct vote in the Executive. Likewise, the Legislative members are also elected by direct vote. No judicial authorities are elected. Judges are appointed after passing rigorous entry [[exams]].

[[Voting]] is compulsory for those aged 18 or older. <ref> Brazilian Federal Constitution, article 14, § 1º, I [http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constituiçao.htm "Constituição Federal"], Brazilian Government (official text).

Candidates must have Brazilian [[nationality]], be affiliated with a [[political party]], and fulfill minimum age requirements as well as basic administrative conditions. No formal education is required, as long as the candidate is alphabetized. <ref> Brazilian Federal Constitution, article 14, § 3º and § 4º[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constituiçao.htm "Constituição Federal"], Brazilian Government (official text).

Four political parties stand out among several small ones: [[Partido dos Trabalhadores|PT]], [[Brazilian Social Democracy Party|PSDB]], [[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party|PMDB]] and [[Party of the Liberal Front|PFL]].

=== Problems ===

Brazil faces an uphill task in organizing its public administrative structure. Reforms have been undertaken in each administration, with mixed results. Public [[institutions]] are widely regarded as inefficient. Unprepared and underpaid state personnel, [[bureaucracy]], lack of [[infrastructure]], and rampant [[corruption]] are some of the major problems still requiring attention from authorities and reformists. 

Recent corruption [[scandals]] have further marred the reputation of public authorities in all branches of government, especially the Legislative. <ref> [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4352654.stm "Brazil lawmakers face expulsion"] BBC News. Accessed May 17, 2007. </ref>

Most areas are [[codified]], although non-codified statutes also represent a substantial part of the system, playing a complementary role. Court decisions set interpretation guidelines, but are not binding towards other cases, save for very few exceptional situations. Doctrinal works and comments of legal scholars have strong influence in law creation and in legal cases.

The Federal Constitution, promulgated on [[October 5]], [[1988]], is the fundamental law of Brazil and governs the system. All other legislation and court decisions must conform to its rules. <ref> Silva, José Afonso da; ''Curso de Direito Constitucional Positivo''; Malheiros, 2004, p. 46, ISBN 85-7420-559-1 </ref> As of April 2007, it has seen 53 Amendments.

The States, Municipalities and Federal District enact, respectively, state, municipal and district laws through local legislative houses.

== States ==
{{Brazil Labelled Map|float=right}}
{{main|States of Brazil}}
Brazil is a [[federation]] consisting of twenty-six states ({{lang|pt|''estados''}}) and one federal district ({{lang|pt|''Distrito Federal''}}), making a total of twenty-seven "federate units"<!--"federal units"...?-->.

The Brazilian states enjoy a significant autonomy of government, law making, public security and taxation. The government of a state is headed by a [[Governor]] ({{lang|pt|''governador''}}), elected by popular vote, and also comprises its own legislative body ({{lang|pt|''assembléia legislativa''}}).
Each state is divided into [[municipality|municipalities]] ({{lang|pt|''municípios''}}) with their own [[legislative]] council ({{lang|pt|''câmara de vereadores''}}) and a mayor ({{lang|pt|''prefeito''}}), which are autonomous and hierarchically independent from both federal and state government. A municipality may include other towns ({{lang|pt|''distritos''}}) besides the municipal seat; those, however, have no separate government.

The [[judiciary]] is organized at the state and federal levels within districts called {{lang|pt|''foros''}}. The {{lang|pt|''foros''}} in the state judiciary are called {{lang|pt|''comarcas''}}. Each {{lang|pt|''comarca''}} may include one or several municipalities. In the federal judiciary the {{lang|pt|''foros''}} are called {{lang|pt|''seções judiciárias''}}. One {{lang|pt|''seção judiciária''}} corresponds to the area of one State or the Federal District, according to article 110 of the Federal Constitution. {{lang|pt|''Seções judiciárias''}} may be divided in smaller units, called {{lang|pt|''subseções judiciárias''}}.

== Geography ==
[[Image:Brazil topo en2.PNG|thumb|right|General map of Brazil]]
{{main|Geography of Brazil}}
Brazil is characterized by the extensive low-lying [[Amazon Rainforest]] in the north and a more open terrain of hills and low mountains to the south &mdash; home to most of the Brazilian population and its agricultural base. Along the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast are also found several mountain ranges, reaching roughly 2,900 [[meter]]s (9,500&nbsp;[[Foot (unit of length)|ft]]) high.

The highest peak is the 3,014 meter (9,735&nbsp;ft) [[Pico da Neblina]] (''Misty Peak'') in [[Guiana]]'s [[highland (geography)|highland]]s. Major rivers include the [[Amazon River|Amazon]], the largest river in the world in flowing water volume, and the second-longest in the world; the [[Paraná River|Paraná]] and its major tributary, the [[Iguaçu]] River, where the [[Iguaçu Falls]] are located; the [[Rio Negro|Negro]], [[São Francisco River|São Francisco]], [[Xingu River|Xingu]], [[Madeira river|Madeira]] and the [[Tapajós]] rivers.

Located mainly within the [[tropics]], Brazil's [[climate]] has little seasonal variation. In southernmost Brazil, however, there is subtropical temperate weather, occasionally experiencing frost and snow in the higher regions. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] is abundant in the humid [[Amazon Basin]], but more arid landscapes are found as well, particularly in the northeast.

A number of [[island]]s in the Atlantic Ocean are part of Brazil:
*[[São Pedro e São Paulo|Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago]]
*[[Rocas Atoll]]
*[[Fernando de Noronha]]
*[[Trindade and Martim Vaz]]

Geographically, mainland Brazil is commonly divided into five [[region]]s: [[North Region, Brazil|North]], [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast]], [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Central-West]], [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast]] and [[Southern Region, Brazil|South]].

[[Image:Floripa2006.png|right|thumb|[[Florianópolis]], in [[Southern Brazil]].]]
[[Image:Boa viagem.jpg|thumb|[[Recife]], in [[Northeast Brazil]].]]

* The North constitutes 45.27% of the surface of Brazil and it is the region with the lowest number of inhabitants. With the exception of [[Manaus]], which hosts a tax-free industrial zone, and [[Belém]], with the biggest metropolitan area of the region, it is a fairly unindustrialized and undeveloped region. It accommodates most of the largest rainforest of the world and many [[indigenous peoples of Brazil|indigenous tribes]].

* The Northeast has one third of Brazil's population. The region is culturally diverse, with roots from the Portuguese colonial period, [[Afro-Brazilian]] culture and some Brazilian Indian influence. It is also the poorest region of Brazil, and has long periods of dry climate. It is well-known for its beautiful coast.  The most important cities are [[Recife]], [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]] and [[Fortaleza]].

* The Central-West has a low demographic density compared to the other regions, mostly because of the [[Pantanal]], the world’s largest marshlands area, and a small part of the Amazon [[rainforest]], in the  northwest. However, much of the region is covered by [[Cerrado]], the largest [[savanna]] in the world. It is also the most important area for agriculture in the country. The most important cities of this region are: [[Brasília]] (the capital), [[Goiânia]], [[Campo Grande]] and [[Cuiabá]].

* The Southeast is the richest and most densely populated region. It has more inhabitants than any other South American country, and hosts one of the largest [[megalopolis (term)|megalopolis]] of the world, whereof the main cities are the country's two biggest ones; [[São Paulo]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]]. The region is very diverse, including the major business centre of São Paulo, the historical cities of Minas Gerais and its capital [[Belo Horizonte]], the third-largest metropolitan area in Brazil, the world famous beaches of Rio de Janeiro, and the acclaimed coast of Espírito Santo.

* The South is the wealthiest region by GDP per capita and has the best [[standard of living]] in the country. It is also the coldest region of Brazil, with occasional occurrences of [[frost]]s and [[snow]] in some of the higher altitude regions. The region has been heavily settled by European immigrants, mainly of Italian, German, Portuguese and [[Slavic people|Slavic]] ancestry, and shows clear influences from these cultures. The most important cities of this region are: [[Porto Alegre]], [[Curitiba]], [[Florianópolis]], [[Blumenau]], [[Novo Hamburgo]], [[Londrina]], [[Caxias do Sul]], [[Pelotas]], [[Passo Fundo]] and [[Joinville]].

===Climate===
[[Image:Brazil min temperature.PNG|right|thumb|[[Temperature]] map for [[May]] [[2007]] in Brazil.]]

Although 90% of the country is within the [[tropical zone]], the climate of Brazil varies considerably from the mostly tropical North (the [[equator]] traverses the mouth of the Amazon) to [[temperate zone]]s below the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] (23°27' S latitude), which crosses the country at the latitude of the city of [[São Paulo (city)|São Paulo]]. Brazil has five climatic regions: [[equatorial]], [[tropical]], [[semiarid]], [[tropical|highland tropical]], and [[subtropical]].

Temperatures along the equator are high, averaging above 25°C, but not reaching the summer extremes of up to 40°C in the temperate zones. There is little seasonal variation near the equator, although at times it can get cool enough for wearing a jacket, especially in the rain. At the country's other extreme, there are frosts south of the Tropic of Capricorn during the winter (June-August), and in some years there is snow in the mountainous areas, such as [[Rio Grande do Sul]] and [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]]. Temperatures in the cities of São Paulo, [[Belo Horizonte]], and [[Brasília]] are moderate (usually between 15°C and 30°C), despite their relatively low latitude, because of their elevation of approximately 1,000 meters. [[Rio de Janeiro (city)|Rio de Janeiro]], [[Recife]], and [[Salvador, Brazil|Salvador]] on the coast have warm climates, with average temperatures ranging from 23°C to 27°C, but enjoy constant trade winds. The southern cities of [[Porto Alegre]] and [[Curitiba]] have a subtropical climate similar to that in parts of the United States and Europe, and temperatures can fall below freezing in winter.

Precipitation levels vary widely. Most of Brazil has moderate [[rainfall]] of between 1,000 and 1,500 millimeters a year, with most of the rain falling in the summer (between December and April) south of the Equator. The [[Amazon region]] is notoriously humid, with rainfall generally more than 2,000 millimeters per year and reaching as high as 3,000 millimeters in parts of the western Amazon and near Belém. It is less widely known that, despite high annual precipitation, the Amazon rain forest has a three- to five-month dry season, the timing of which varies according to location north or south of the equator.<ref>[http://www.el-dmc.com.br/brazil/climate.asp Climate in Brazil]</ref>

{{main|Economy of Brazil}} 
{{seealso|Economic history of Brazil}} 

Possessing large and well-developed [[Agriculture|agricultural]], [[mining]], [[manufacturing]],<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/br.html CIA Factbook]</ref> and [[service sector]]s, as well as a large labor pool, Brazil's GDP (PPP) outweighs that of any other [[Latin America]]n country, being the core economy of [[Mercosul]]. The country has been expanding its presence in international financial and commodities markets, and is regarded as one of the group of four emerging economies called [[BRIC]]. Major export products include [[Fixed-wing aircraft|aircraft]], [[coffee]], [[vehicles]], [[soybean]], [[iron ore]], [[orange juice]], [[steel]], [[ethanol]], [[textiles]], [[footwear]], [[corned beef]] and [[electrical equipment]]. 

According to the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]], Brazil has the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|ninth largest]] economy in the world at [[Purchasing Power Parity]] and [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|tenth largest]] at market exchange rates. Brazil has a diversified middle income economy with wide variations in development levels. Most large industry is agglomerated in the [[Southern Region, Brazil|Southern]] and [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast]]. The [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast]] is the poorest [[Regions of Brazil|region of Brazil]], but it is beginning to attract new [[investment]].<ref>[http://www.brasil.gov.br/ingles/about_brazil/indicators/economics/categoria_view Economics] Brazilian Government</ref>

Brazil's diverse industries range from automobiles, steel and petrochemicals to computers, aircraft, and consumer goods and amount to one-third of the [[GDP]]. With the increased economic stability provided by the [[Plano Real]], Brazilian and multinational businesses have invested heavily in new equipment and technology, a large proportion of which has been purchased from [[North America]]n enterprises.

Brazil has a diverse and sophisticated services industry as well. During the early 1990s, the banking sector amounted to as much as 16% of GDP. Although undergoing a major overhaul, Brazilian financial services industry provides local businesses with a wide range of products and is attracting numerous new entrants, including U.S. financial firms. The [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] and [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] stock exchanges are undergoing a consolidation.<ref>[http://www.brasil.gov.br/ingles/about_brazil/brasil_topics/economy/categoria_view Economy and business] Brazilian Government</ref>

As a core country of both [[G20 industrial nations]] and [[G20 developing nations]], Brazil has been expanding its influence in global economic negotiations, such as the currently debated [[Doha Development Round|Doha Round]]. Although Brazil's economy is progressive and regionally important, the problems of widespread state [[bureaucracy]], [[Political corruption|corruption]], [[poverty]] and [[illiteracy]] are still major barriers to furthering its development.

{{main|Environment of Brazil}}

Brazil's immense area is subdivided into different [[ecosystem]]s, which together sustain some of the world's greatest [[biodiversity]]. Due to the relatively explosive economic and demographic rise of the country in the last century, Brazil's ability to protect its [[Habitat (ecology)|environmental habitat]]s has increasingly come under threat. Extensive [[logging]] in the nation's forests, particularly the Amazon, both official and unofficial, destroys areas the size of a small country each year, and potentially a diverse variety of interesting plants and animals.<ref>[http://www.fs.fed.us/global/globe/l_amer/brazil.htm Forest Service International Programs: Brazil] [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] Forest Service International Programs, retrieved February 2007.</ref>

With abundant [[fauna]] and [[flora]], Brazil is home to many thousands of species, most of them still undiscovered. By 2020, it is estimated that at least 50% of the species resident in Brazil will become extinct.<ref>[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=989&page=19 Books] Biodiversity</ref>

As several of these specimens possess special characteristics, or are built in an interesting way, some of their capabilities may be copied for use in technology (see [[bionics]]). The revenues derived from such plans may still hold the key to preserve the country's animal and plant species.

There is general consensus, that Brazil has the highest number of both terrestrial vertebrates and invertebrates of any country in the world. This high diversity of fauna can be explained by the sheer size of Brazil and also the great variation in ecosystems. The numbers published about Brazil's fauna diversity can vary from source to source, as taxonomists sometimes disagree about species classifications and information can be incomplete or out of date. Also new species continue to be discovered and, sadly, some species go extinct in the wild. Brazil has the highest primate diversity of any country in the world with 77 species and fresh water fish (over 3000 species), it claims the second-highest number of amphibian species, the third highest number of bird species and is ranked fifth in reptile species. Many of the species that are at risk live in threatened habitats such as the [[Atlantic Forest]].

{{main|Demography of Brazil}}
Brazil's population is very diverse, comprising many races and [[ethnic group]]s. In general, Brazilians trace their origins from four sources of [[migration]]:

# [[Amerindians]], Brazil's indigenous population, came from human groups that migrated from [[Siberia]] across the [[Bering Strait]] around 9000 BC.
# [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] colonists and settlers, arriving from 1500 onward.
# Diverse groups of [[immigrant]]s from [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and the [[Middle East]] arriving in Brazil during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
# [[Africa]]n [[slave]]s brought to the country from 1530 until the end of the slave trade in 1850.

It is believed that the Americas were settled by three migratory waves from Northern Asia. The Brazilian Indians are thought to be descended from the first wave of migrants, who arrived in the region around 9000 BC. The main Native Brazilian groups were the [[Tupi]]-[[Guarani]], the [[Jê]], the [[Arawaks]] and the Caraibas ([[Caribs]]). The [[Tupi]]-[[Guarani]] nation, originally from the [[Parana river]] basin and also the main of Native-[[Paraguay]]an nations, had spread all along the Brazilian coastline from South to North and got to be known by the Portuguese as "Os Índios da Língua Geral" ("The Indians of the General Language"); the [[Jê]] nation occupied the most of the interior of the country from [[Maranhão]] to [[Santa Catarina]]. The [[Arawaks]] and the [[Caribs]], the last ones to get in contact with the Portuguese, lived in the North and Northwest of Brazil.

The [[Europe]]an [[immigration to Brazil]] started in the sixteenth century, the vast majority of them coming from [[Portugal]]. In the first two centuries of colonization, 100,000 Portuguese arrived in Brazil (around 500 colonists per year). In the eighteenth century, 600,000 Portuguese arrived (6,000 per year). The first region to be settled by the Portuguese was [[Northeastern Brazil]], followed by the [[Southeastern Brazil|Southeastern]] region. The interior began to be settled during the eighteenth century. The Portuguese were the only ethnic group to settle across Brazil.  

[[Image:Kuarup3.jpg|left|thumb|Ritual ceremony by Xavante Indians in the [[Xingu River]] region]] 
The original Amerindian population of Brazil (between three and five million) has in large part been exterminated or assimilated into the Portuguese population. The [[Mameluco]]s (or [[Caboclo]]s, multiple-race between [[Whites]] and Indians) have always been present in many parts of Brazil.

Another important ethnic group, [[Africa]]ns, first arrived as slaves. At first many came from [[Guinea]], although by the end of the eighteenth century many had been taken from [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]] (or, in [[Bahia]], from [[Nigeria]]). By the time of the end of the slave trade in [[1850]], around three to five million slaves had been brought to Brazil &ndash; 37% of all slave traffic between Africa and the Americas. At the time of slavery a [[multiracial]] people came out through rapes or affairs between white masters and  black or Indian slaves. Nowadays, there are still immigration waves coming from the African continent, from countries such as [[Cape Verde]] and [[São Tomé and Príncipe]].

The largest influx of European immigrants to Brazil occurred in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Between 1870 and 1930, more than 5 million immigrants entered Brazil. These immigrants were divided in two groups: a part of them was sent to [[Southern Brazil]] to work as small [[farm]]ers. However, the biggest part of the immigrants was sent to [[Southeastern Brazil]] to work in the [[coffee]] [[plantation]]s. The immigrants sent to Southern Brazil were mainly [[Germans]] (starting in 1824, mainly from [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], [[Pomerania]], [[Hamburg]], [[Westphalia]], etc) and [[Italians]] (starting in 1875, mainly from the [[Veneto]] and [[Lombardia]]). In the South, the immigrants established rural communities that, still today, have a strong cultural connection  with their ancestral homelands. In Southeastern Brazil most of the immigrants were Italians (mainly from the [[Veneto]], [[Campania]], [[Calabria]] and [[Lombardia]]), Portuguese (mainly from [[Beira Alta]], [[Minho (province)|Minho]] and [[Alto Trás-os-Montes]]), [[Spaniards]] (mainly from [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Andalusia]]).

Notably, the early part of the twentieth century saw a large influx of [[Japanese people|Japanese]] (mainly from [[Honshū]], [[Hokkaidō]] and [[Okinawa]]) and [[Arab]]s (from [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]]).  These Arab immigrants were -and still are- wrongly called "[[Turkish people|Turks]]" by many [[Brazilian]]s because their original countries were still under Turkish rule back in the times Arab immigration to Brazil began.  The number of actual [[Turkish people|Turks]] who immigrated to Brazil was in fact very small.

According to the ''Memorial do Imigrante'',<ref>{{cite web |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Memorial do Imigrante |work= |publisher= |date= |url=http://www.memorialdoimigrante.sp.gov.br Memorial do Imigrante |format= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> Brazil attracted nearly 5.5 million immigrants between 1870 and 1953: approximately 1,550,000 [[Italo-Brazilian|Italians]], 1,470,000 Portuguese, 650,000 Spaniards, 210,000 Germans, 190,000 Japanese, 120,000 [[Poles]] and 650,000 of many other nationalities.

Brazil's population is mostly concentrated along the coast, with a lower population density in the interior. The population of the southern states is mainly of European descent, while the majority of the inhabitants of the north and northeast are of [[multiracial]] ancestry (Amerindians, Africans and Europeans)

According to the Brazilian Constitution of 1988, racism is an unbailable crime and must be met with imprisonment. This is taken very seriously.

===Languages===
{{main|Languages of Brazil}}
{{seealso|Brazilian Portuguese}}

[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is the only official language of Brazil. It is spoken by nearly the entire population and is virtually the only language used in schools, newspapers, radio, TV and for all business and administrative purposes. Moreover, Brazil is the only Portuguese-speaking nation in [[the Americas]], making the language an important part of Brazilian national identity. 

Portuguese as spoken in Brazil has developed independently of the European mother tongue, and it has undergone fewer phonetic changes than the language spoken in Portugal, thus it is often said that the "[[language]] of [[Camões]]", who lived in the fifteenth century, sounded closer to modern Brazilian Portuguese, than to the language spoken in Portugal today, and that his work is poetically more perfect when read the Brazilian way.

===Minority languages===

Many Amerindian languages are spoken daily in indigenous communities, primarily in Northern Brazil. Although many of these communities have significant contact with Portuguese, today there are incentives for teaching and preserving native languages. According to SIL International, 133 native American languages are currently endangered. Some of the largest indigenous language groups include Arawak, Carib, Macro-Gê and Tupi<ref>[http://www.sil.org/americas/brasil/PortLang.htm SIL International, Línguas Indígenas do Brasil]</ref>. In 2006, the City of [[Sao Gabriel da Cachoeira]] in the region of Cabeça do Cachorro (Northwestern region of the State of [[Amazonas]]), has adopted some indigenous languages as some of its other official languages along with [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].

Other languages are spoken by descendants of immigrants, who are usually bilingual, in small rural communities in Southern Brazil. The most important are the [[Brazilian German]] dialects, such as [[Riograndenser Hunsrückisch]] and the [[Pomeranian language]], and also the [[Talian]], based on the [[Italian Language|Italian]] [[Venetian language]]. In the city of [[São Paulo]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Korean language|Korean]] can be heard in the immigrant neighborhoods, such as [[Liberdade]]. 

[[English language|English]] is also part of the official high school curriculum in most of the Brazilian states, but few Brazilians are truly fluent in the language, even in Brazilian universities. [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is understood to varying degrees by many Brazilians, especially on the borders with Colombia, Peru, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. The same applies to French which is spoken and understood in the cities bordering the French Guyana.

== Social issues ==
[[Image:RiodeJaneiro-Favela.jpg|thumb|right|Entrenched between some of the richer areas of [[Rio de Janeiro]], the [[Vidigal]] ''[[favela]]'' is testimony to high [[economic inequality]] within Brazil.]]

According to [[Fundação Getulio Vargas]], in June 2006 the rate of poverty based into lacework was of 18.57% of the population - a 19.8% reduction during the previous four years.<ref> [http://www.fgv.br/cps/pesquisas/miseria_queda_grafico_clicavel/Grafico_Miseria.pdf FGV - Gráfico Miséria]</ref> The rate of poverty is in part attributed to the country's [[economic inequality]]. Brazil ranks among the world's highest nations in the [[Gini coefficient]] index of inequality assessment.

Poverty in Brazil is most visually represented by the various ''[[favela]]s'', [[slum]]s in the country's metropolitan areas and remote upcountry regions that suffer with economic underdevelopment and below-par standards of living. There are also great differences in wealth and welfare between regions.<ref>{{cite web |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=PIB dos municípios revela concentração e desigualdades na geração de renda |work= |publisher= |date= |url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/presidencia/noticias/noticia_visualiza.php?id_noticia=354&id_pagina=1 |format= |doi= |accessdate=2007-02-22}}</ref> While the Northeast region has the worst [[economic indicator]]s nationwide due to low comprehensiveness and quality of public services, seasonal [[drought]] in rural areas, and widespread [[Political corruption|corruption]], many cities in the South and Southeast enjoy [[First World]] [[socioeconomic]] standards.<ref> [http://www.fundaj.gov.br/docs/pe/pe0114.html Fundação Joaquim Nabuco - Research report]</ref> In 2005, Brazil had more than 15 million (10.2%) people that were considered to be [[Illiteracy|illiterate]].<ref>
[http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/populacao/trabalhoerendimento/pnad2005/sintesepnad2005.pdf IBGE: Work and Earnings Report - 2005 statistics]</ref>

A recent attempt to mitigate these problems is the "''[[Fome Zero]]''" hunger-eradication program implemented by President [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]].  Part of this is "''[[Bolsa Família]]''", a major anti-poverty program that gives money directly to impoverished families.

Violence is also a part of life in Brazil, due to many social issues such as the blatant inequality between haves and have nots, which generates crime and petty thefts. Muggings, robberies and [[kidnapping]]s are quite common in many cities, being even considered normal by many Brazilians.

{{main|Culture of Brazil}} 
The core culture of Brazil is rooted in the [[culture of Portugal]]. The Portuguese [[colonist]]s and immigrants brought the [[Roman Catholic]] [[faith]], the Portuguese language and many [[tradition]]s and customs that still influence the modern-day Brazilian culture.

As a [[multiracial]] country, its culture also absorbed other influences. The Amerindian peoples influenced Brazil's language and [[Cuisine of Brazil|cuisine]] and the Africans, brought as slaves, largely influenced [[Music of Brazil|Brazil's music]], [[dance]], cuisine, religion and language. The [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] traditions, from nowadays Southwest [[Nigeria]] had made its way strongly into Afro-Brazilian religion and into Brazilian religiousness as a whole. Ancient [[Yoruba mythology|Yoruba]] [[Orishas]] (gods) like [[Shango]] and [[Oxum]] are largely worshipped in Brazil, while [[samba]] and [[capoeira]] (musical rhythm and martial art, respectively) were originally contributions from the [[Bantus|Bantu peoples]] from [[Angola]].

[[Italy|Italian]], [[Germany|German]] and other European [[immigrant]]s came in large numbers and their influences are felt closer to the Southeast and South of Brazil.

According to the [[IBGE]] census:<ref>{{cite web  | last = | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = Religion in Brazil | work =  | publisher = IBGE | date = 2000 | url = http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/populacao/censo2000/populacao/religiao_Censo2000.pdf | format = pdf | doi =  | accessdate = 2007-04-24 }}</ref>
* 74% are [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] (about 139 million).
* 15.4% are [[Protestant]]s (about 28 million).
* {{spaces|2}}7.4% consider themselves [[Agnosticism|agnostics]], [[Atheism|atheists]] or without a religion (about 12 million).
* {{spaces|2}}1.3% are followers of [[Spiritism]] (about 2.2 million).
* {{spaces|2}}0.3% are followers of African traditional religions such as [[Candomblé]] and [[Umbanda]].
* {{spaces|2}}1.7% are members of other religions. Some of these are [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] (1,100,000), [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Latter-day Saints]] (600,000)<ref>[http://www.lds.org.br/brz_mn_item.asp?v_section=2&v_item=8&v_mask=POREMMADEE Igreja no Brasil]</ref>, [[Buddhism]] (215,000), [[Judaism]] (87,000), and [[Islam in Brazil|Islam]] (27,000).
* Some practice a mixture of different religions, such as Catholicism, Candomblé, and indigenous American religions.

Brazil has the largest [[Roman Catholicism in Brazil|Roman Catholic]] population in the world.

Followers of [[Protestantism]] are rising in number.  Until 1970, the majority of Brazilian Protestants were the ones of "traditional churches", mostly [[Lutheran]]s, [[Presbyterian]]s and [[Baptist]]s. Since then, numbers of [[Pentecostal]] and Neopentecostal adherents have increased significantly.

[[Islam in Brazil]] was first practiced by African slaves.  Today, the Muslim population in Brazil is made up of mostly [[Arab]] immigrants. A recent trend has been the increase in conversions to Islam among non-Arab citizens.<ref>[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71451.htm US Department of State - International Religious Freedom Report 2006]</ref>

The largest population of Buddhists in Latin America lives in Brazil.  This is mostly because Brazil has the largest [[Japanese-Brazilian|Japanese]] population outside [[Japan]].

Brazil appears as a devout country to outsiders yet in an [[IBOPE]] poll, about 8% of Brazilians declared themselves to be non-religious (with 2% declaring themselves atheists) and 58% of Catholics considered themselves "not very practicing" or "not at all practicing".<ref>{{cite web |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Pesquisa de Opinião dos Católicos Brasileiros sobre Direitos Reprodutivos, Relação Igreja-Estado e temas Relacionados |work= |publisher= |date= |url=http://www.ibope.com.br/opiniao_publica/downloads/opp008_catolicos_brasileiros_nucleo1.pdf |format=pdf |doi= |accessdate=2007-02-19}}</ref>

{{main|Science and technology in Brazil}}
Brazil has today a well developed organization of [[science and technology]].

Basic research is largely carried out in public [[university|universities]] and research centers and institutes, and some in private institutions, particularly in non-profit [[non-governmental organizations]]. Thanks to governmental regulations and incentives, however, since the [[1990s]] is has been growing in the private universities and companies, as well. Accordingly, more than 90% of funding for basic research comes from governmental sources.<ref>[http://www.brasil.gov.br/ingles/about_brazil/brasil_topics/science/categoria_view Science and technology] Brazilian Government</ref>

Some of Brazil's most important technology nodes are located in [[São José dos Campos]], [[Campinas]], [[São Carlos]], Rio de Janeiro, [[Curitiba]], [[Porto Alegre]], Belo Horizonte, [[Recife]] and São Paulo.

Brazilian [[information technology]] is comparable to other countries that play a major role in the international market, like [[India]] and [[China]] but with a bigger internal market, the exports of software still limited.<ref>[http://www.bndes.gov.br/conhecimento/seminario/EugenioStaub.pdf Panorama da Indústria Brasileira de Eletro-Eletrônica e Software]</ref> Catering for the internal market, Brazilian IT is particularly efficient in [[financial services]], [[Defense industry|defense]], [[CRM]], [[eGovernment]], and [[healthcare]]. The government of Brazil is attempting a switch to [[free software]] and [[operating system]]s in place of [[proprietary software]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Brazil adopts open-source software |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4602325.stm |date=[[2005-06-02]]}}</ref>

Major Brazilian scientific research institutions with worldwide recognition, include the [[Oswaldo Cruz Institute]], the [[Butantan Institute]] and the [[Brazilian Enterprise of Agropecuary Research]].

The [[Brazilian Space Agency]] (''Agência Espacial Brasileira'') is the civilian authority in Brazil that is in charge of the country's burgeoning space program. It operates a rocket launch site at [[Alcântara, Maranhão]].<ref>[http://www.aeb.gov.br/conteudo.php?ida=27&idc=5 Brazilian Space Agency]</ref>
