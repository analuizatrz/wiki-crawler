'''Kaziranga National Park''' ({{lang-as|কাজিৰঙা ৰাষ্ট্ৰীয় উদ্যান}}, [[IAST]]: kājirangā rāstriya uddyāna, [[help:IPA|pronounced]] {{Audio-IPA|Kaziranga-pronounce.ogg|/kaziɹɔŋa ɹastɹijɔ udːjan/}}) is a [[National park of India|national park]] in the [[Golaghat district|Golaghat]] and [[Nagaon district]]s of [[Assam]], [[India]]. It is a [[World Heritage Site]], and two-thirds of the world's [[Indian Rhinoceros|Great One-horned Rhinoceros]]es live in the park.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6564337.stm |work=BBC News |title=Assam rhino poaching 'spirals' |author=Bhaumik, Subir |date=[[17 April]] [[2007]] |accessdate=2007-04-28}}</ref> Kaziranga has the highest density of [[Bengal tiger|tiger]]s among [[protected area]]s in the world and was declared a [[Tiger Reserve]] in 2006. The park has large breeding populations of [[Asian Elephant|elephants]], [[Asiatic Water Buffalo|water buffalo]] and [[swamp deer]]. Kaziranga is recognised as an [[Important Bird Area]] by [[Birdlife International]] for conservation of avifaunal species. The park has achieved notable success in [[wildlife conservation]] compared to other protected areas in [[India]]. Located on the edge of the [[Eastern Himalaya]] [[biodiversity hotspot]], the park combines high-species diversity and visibility.

Kaziranga is a vast expanse of tall [[elephant grass]], [[marshland]] and dense [[tropical moist broadleaf forests]] crisscrossed by four major rivers, including the [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]], and has numerous [[beel|small bodies]] of water. Kaziranga has been the theme of several books, documentaries and songs. The park celebrated its centenary in 2005 after its establishment in 1905 as a [[reserve forest]].

==Etymology==
Though the etymology of the name Kaziranga is not certain, there exist a number of possible explanations.  According to one legend, a girl named Ranga, from a nearby village, and a youth named Kazi, from [[Karbi Anglong District|Karbi Anglong]], fell in love.  This match was not acceptable to their families, and the couple disappeared into the forest, never to be seen again.  The forest was then named after them.<ref>{{cite web | title = Kaziranga National Park-Myth and Mysteries | publisher = Kaziranga National Park Authorities | url= http://www.kaziranga100.com/Myth.htm | accessdate = 2007-02-23 }}</ref>  According to another legend, [[Srimanta Sankardeva]], the [[16th century]] [[Vaisnavism|Vaisnava]] saint-scholar, once blessed a childless couple, Kazi and Rangai, and asked them to dig a big pond in the region so that their name would live on.  Testimony to the history of the name can be found in some records, which state that once, while the [[Ahom Dynasty|Ahom king]] [[Pratap Singha]] ([[17th century]]) was passing by the region, he was particularly impressed by the taste of fish and on inquiry, he was told it came from Kaziranga.<ref name="un7">{{cite web | last = Mathur | first = V.B. | coauthors = Sinha, P.R. and Mishra, Manoj | title = UNESCO EoH Project_South Asia Technical Report No. -7 -Kaziranga National Park | publisher = UNESCO |url=http://www.enhancingheritage.net/docs/UNESCOEoH_Project_South_Asia_Technical_Report_07_v1.pdf | format =PDF | accessdate = 2007-02-28|pages= pp. 15-16 }}</ref>

However, some historians believe that the name Kaziranga was derived from the Karbi Word ''Kajir-a-rang'', which means "the village of Kajir (kajiror gaon)". Among the [[Karbi]]s, Kajir is a common name for a girl child,<ref>{{cite web | title = Karbis of Assam | publisher = worldpress.com | url= http://karbi.wordpress.com | accessdate = 2007-05-19 }}</ref>  and it was believed that a woman named Kajir once ruled over the area.  Fragments of monoliths associated with Karbi rule found scattered in the area seem to bear testimony to this assertion. Kaziranga could also mean the "Land of red goats (Deer)", as the word ''Kazi'' in the [[Karbi]] language means "Goat", and ''Rangai'' means "Red".<ref name="un7"/>

There is a difference in altitude between the eastern and western areas, with the western side being at a lower altitude. The western reaches of the park are dominated by grasslands. Tall elephant grass is found on higher ground, while short grasses cover the lower grounds surrounding the beels or flood-created ponds.<ref name = "un"/> Annual flooding, grazing by herbivores and [[controlled burn]]ing maintains and fertilizes the grasslands and reeds. Common tall grasses are [[Saccharum spontaneum|sugarcanes]], [[Imperata cylindrica|spear grass]], [[Arundo donax|Elephant Grass]] and the [[Phragmites|Common Reed]]. Numerous [[forb]]s are present along with the grasses. Amidst the grasses, providing cover and shade are scattered trees—dominant species including [[Careya arborea|Kumbhi]], [[Indian gooseberry]], the [[Bombax ceiba|cotton]] tree (in savanna woodlands), and [[Dillenia|Elephant apple]] (in inundated grasslands).<ref name = "un"/> 

Thick evergreen forests, near the Kanchanjhuri, Panbari and Tamulipathar blocks, contain trees such as ''[[Aphanamixis polystachya]], [[Talauma hodgsonii]], Dillenia indica, [[Garcinia]] tinctoria, [[Ficus]] rumphii, [[Cinnamomum]] bejolghota'', and species of [[Syzygium]].

The Wildlife wing of the forest department of the Government of Assam is responsible for the administration and management of Kaziranga, which is headquartered at [[Bokakhat]].<ref name="unescotech"/>{{rp|p.05}} The administrative head of the park is the director, who is a conservator-level officer. A divisional forest officer is the administrative chief executive of the park. He is assisted by two officers with the rank of assistant conservator of forests. The park area is divided into four ranges, overseen by range forest officers.<ref name="unescotech"/>{{rp|p.11}} The four ranges are the Burapahar, Baguri, Central, and Eastern. They are headquartered at Ghorakati, Baguri, Kohora, and Agoratoli, respectively. Each range is further sub-divided into beats, headed by a forester, and sub-beats, headed by a forest guard.<ref name="unescotech"/>{{rp|p.11}}  

The park receives financial aid from the State Government as well as the [[Ministry of Environment and Forests (India)|Ministry of Environment and Forests]] of [[Government of India]] under various Plan and Non-Plan Budgets. Additional funding is received under the [[Project Elephant]] from the Central Government. In 1997–1998, a grant of [[US$]] 100,000 was received under the Technical Co-operation for Security Reinforcement scheme from the [[World Heritage Fund]].<ref name="unsummary"/>{{rp|p.02}} Additional funding is also received from national & international [[Non-governmental organizations]].

Kaziranga National Park has been granted maximum protection under the Indian law for wildlife conservation. Various laws, which include the ''Assam Forest Regulation of 1891'' and the ''Biodiversity Conservation Act of 2002'' have been enacted for protection of wildlife in the park.<ref name="unsummary"/>{{rp|p.01}}  Poaching activities, particularly of the rhinoceroses for its horn, has been a major concern for the authorities.
