'''Master Chief Petty Officer SPARTAN-117''', commonly referred to in-game as simply '''Master Chief''' or '''the Chief''', is the fictional protagonist within the [[Halo universe]]. He is the main character of the [[video game]] ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'', and one of the two [[playable character]]s in ''[[Halo 2]]''. He will appear at least once more in the forthcoming game ''[[Halo 3]]''. He also appears in the novels ''[[Halo: The Fall of Reach]]'', ''[[Halo: The Flood]]'', and ''[[Halo: First Strike]]'', and is briefly featured in both ''[[Halo: Ghosts of Onyx]]'' and the ''[[Halo Graphic Novel]]''. 

==Background==
[[Image:Master chief-1-.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Master Chief in action]]
Although his official military designation is ''Spartan-117'', he is most often referred to simply as "Master Chief", short for his rank of [[Master Chief Petty Officer]]. The assignment of Navy enlisted rates to him and other [[SPARTAN-II Project|SPARTAN-IIs]] resembles the usage of these rates by the [[United States Navy]], a correlation further evidenced by the fact that his unit is attached to the [[United Nations Space Command|UNSC]]'s "[[Naval Special Warfare]]" division.

The Master Chief is a [[SPARTAN-II Project|SPARTAN-II]] [[Supersoldier|Super Soldier]], a biologically-enhanced and cybernetically-augmented commando. Extensive surgical alteration coupled with a rigorous lifelong training regimen has resulted in Master Chief being significantly stronger than even the strongest natural human, and his strength and fighting ability are further augmented by the advanced [[MJOLNIR battle armor|MJOLNIR]] (myohl-nir, [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]:[Mjolnər]) battle armor he wears. In the books, the SPARTANs were originally assigned to the task of putting down rebels and insurgents within the [[United Nations Space Command]]; when the powerful alien hegemony known as the [[The Covenant (Halo)|Covenant]] attacked, the Chief and his fellow SPARTANs had a priority shift.

He, as well as his other SPARTANs, can sprint at bursts of 60 km/h as told in "The Fall of Reach". He is approximately forty-one years old at the time of the events of ''Halo: Combat Evolved''.<ref name=timeline>{{cite web|url=http://halosm.bungie.org/story/halostory.timeline.html|title=''Halo'' Universe Timeline|work=halo.bungie.org|accessdate=2007-03-20}}</ref> In his armor, he stands about 7 feet tall. Between ''Halo: Combat Evolved'' and ''Halo 2'', the Chief's armor is upgraded from MJOLNIR Mark V to Mark VI. Both iterations of the armor include a helmet with a reflective visor so the face of the Chief is never seen. In spite of this, he is seen removing his helmet once in each game, the camera angle always concealing his face from the player. The novels describe Master Chief out of armor as a tall, ghostly pale man with short military-style hair, freckles, and a blank yet sorrowful expression. Master Chief is voiced by [[Steve Downes]] in both ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'' and ''[[Halo 2]]'', and Downes has been confirmed to be returning for ''[[Halo 3]]''.

==Character history==
===''The Fall of Reach/Ghosts of Onyx''===

John (Master Chief) was born in 2511 and spent the first part of his childhood on the human colony planet [[Eridanus 2]] where he lived with his family. John was large for his six years of age, approximately a foot above his school peers. At this age he is described as a typical boy, having brown hair, freckles and a gap in between his two front teeth.

In 2517, John and seventy-four other children his age were covertly taken from their homes and replaced with [[United Nations Space Command#Flash clones|flash clones]] to hide the kidnapping. The original children were brought to planet [[Reach (Halo)|Reach]], one of the [[United Nations Space Command|UNSC]]'s headquarters, to train to become SPARTAN-II supersoldiers. On Reach, the abducted children began intensive physical, mental and psychological training as part of the Spartan program by Chief Petty Officer Franklin Mendez, and were assigned new identification numbers instead of last names. John became known as John-117.

On the first day ([[September 24]], [[2517]]) John met his teammates Kelly-087 and Sam-034, who would become his best friends. On [[July 12]], 2519, at the age of eight they were sent out into the wilderness in Pelican dropships to participate in a survival exercise. CPO Mendez warned them that the last trainee to complete the objective had to walk back to the base from the mountainous wilderness, which was a very long walk. After being dropped off individually and linking up, John and the other trainees found the Pelican to be guarded by drill instructors who were out of uniform and under orders to attack any trainee who approached the ship.  John wanted to make sure everyone got back so he and his fellow trainees brutally beat the guards, stole the Pelican and flew it back to the military complex, with the guide of their teacher AI, Déjà. When they returned home, John insisted that if anyone should be punished, it should be him, since he was the last one to board the Pelican. Due to this John was promoted to Squad Leader as a result of both his ability to adapt and his leadership over the other Spartans.

In March 2525, the children were biologically and cybernetically augmented and enhanced. These procedures had substantial risks, and only thirty-three Spartans of the original seventy-five survived to functional status after the augmentations. Of the others, twelve were crippled in surgery and were relegated to tactical and administrative duties as part of Naval Intelligence. When John asked Mendez what to do on his next mission (he considered their augmentation a "mission" with substantial casualties) to avoid such heavy losses, Mendez replied by saying that some losses are acceptable; however, he tells John that there is a difference between a life spent and a life wasted, and this lesson followed John for the rest of his career.

John-117's first real mission was against rebels in the asteroid belt of the Eridanus System, where his homeworld was located. He was wounded while leading his squad to capture Colonel Robert Watts, leader of the insurgent forces. He received a [[Purple Heart]] after the mission.

Later on [[November 2]], [[2525]] he was briefed on the Covenant threat; he and the other Spartans would fight for many years against this new enemy. They were first sent to the Damascus Materials Testing Facility on the planet Chi Ceti 4 to retrieve the MJOLNIR Mark IV armor. While retrieving the armor, the UNSC ship on which they had arrived encountered a Covenant frigate in the system and was severely damaged in the battle. After leaving the planet, Sam, Kelly, and John subsequently boarded the enemy vessel and planted a bomb. This insertion ultimately resulted in the death of Sam, who, due to his suit being breached from a plasma bolt, stayed behind to ensure the successful detonation of the explosives. 

On [[May 1]], 2531, John and his SPARTAN-II team had been sent to the 111 Tauri System, on Planet Victoria, to recover nuclear warheads stolen by rebel insurgents. Among his five-man team, Kurt-051 became Sam's replacement, a former rival during training whom John felt would jeopardize the mission due to Kurt's "lack of discipline" and "having funny feelings." However, when John, Kelly-087, Linda-058, and Fred-104 were captured by rebel commandos, John's doubts were proven wrong as Kurt initiated a successful one-man-rescue.

In 2552 the Covenant launched an invasion of the human world of Sigma Octanus and occupied one of the human cities, Cote D'Azure. John and three teams of Spartans were sent in to destroy the Covenant force with a nuclear warhead following a failed Marine assault. While in the city, John and his team discovered the Covenant were scanning an ancient stone artifact in the city's museum, and recovered it before detonating the nuclear warhead.

As humanity fought a losing war against the Covenant, the UNSC High Command developed a last-ditch plan to capture a Covenant High Prophet, who they hoped could be used in order to barter a truce. Prior to planning out the mission, the MJOLNIR Mark IV armor got upgraded to the Mark V, integrating the Covenant's energy shielding system and the ability to house an AI. The Master Chief was the first to test the armor, and he was introduced to [[Cortana]], who would become his partner for the operation. Despite attempted sabotage by [[List of Halo series characters#James Ackerson|Colonel Ackerson]], the test was a spectacular success, due to John and Cortana's teamwork.

Before the physical part of the mission could be put into action, Reach, the staging ground for the operation and the UNSC center of naval operations, was attacked. The majority of the Spartans were diverted to Reach's surface to defend groundside installations and the fusion reactors for the MAC guns in orbit. The Master Chief was sent along with two other Spartans, Linda and James, to destroy a small Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) stealth ship so that the vessel's navigation info, which could lead the Covenant to Earth, would not fall into enemy hands. As the UNSC fleet, the Marines, and the Spartans defending Reach were being destroyed, the Master Chief managed to complete his mission and return to the ''Pillar of Autumn''. Knowing Reach was lost, Cortana plotted a random course as per the [[The Cole Protocol|Cole Protocol]]. The Master Chief, seemingly the last Spartan alive, went into [[cryonics|cryogenic sleep]] along with the ''Autumn''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> crew, standard operating procedure for slipspace jumps. As Reach was burned by the Covenant bombardment, several Spartans managed to escape and hide in the one area that was not being targeted.

===''Halo: Combat Evolved'' and ''The Flood''===
{{see also|Halo: Combat Evolved|Halo: The Flood}}

Upon coming out of [[slipspace]], the ''Pillar of Autumn'' was attacked by the Covenant and crash landed on [[Halo (megastructure)|Halo]]. In the midst of fighting the Covenant, it was discovered that Halo was a ring-shaped construct created by the [[Forerunners]] as a last line of defense against an alien parasite called [[The Flood (Halo)|The Flood]]. The Flood was accidentally unleashed by exploratory Covenant; as a direct result, a majority of the Covenant and UNSC troops who landed on Halo were infected and became Flood themselves. 

On behalf of the installation's Monitor, a hundred millennia-old A.I. called [[343 Guilty Spark]], the Master Chief retrieved the Index, a device which would activate Halo and supposedly wipe out the Flood. However, Guilty Spark neglected to inform Master Chief that Halo would accomplish this by destroying all sentient life in a vast radius, essentially starving The Flood to death. From Guilty Spark's words, it is implied that he believed that the "other installations" would follow suit, and the entire galaxy would be wiped clean of sentient life. 

Cortana's timely intervention prevented Halo's activation, and the two decided to destroy Halo itself. Fighting off immeasurable numbers of Covenant, Flood, and Guilty Spark's Forerunner Sentinels, the Chief temporarily disabled Halo's firing mechanism by destroying its three pulse generators that would magnify its range, and made his way back to the ''Pillar of Autumn''. There, he detonated the ship's fusion reactor core to trigger an explosion that initiated a chain reaction that allowed Halo's centripetal forces to tear itself apart, destroying Halo and crippling the Covenant invasion/occupation forces led by the future [[Arbiter (Halo)|Arbiter]] that had destroyed Reach and pursued the ''Pillar of Autumn''.

===''First Strike''===
{{see also|Halo: First Strike}}
The Master Chief, along with the few UNSC personnel who survived Halo, managed to capture the Covenant flagship ''Ascendant Justice'', and return to Reach to contact Earth's High Command. At Reach, the Master Chief discovered that the Covenant had not eradicated the planet's [[biosphere]] the way they normally did, and that a few other Spartans were still alive. He retrieved them, as well as Dr. Catherine Halsey, the creative genius behind the SPARTAN-II project. The Spartans then attacked a Covenant command station, the ''Unyielding Hierophant'', which was being used as a staging area for an attack on Earth's coordinates.

By the end of the novel, the only other remaining Halo survivor is [[Sergeant Avery Johnson]], whose life was in the Master Chief's hands. Prior to Dr. Halsey's disappearance, Halsey gives Master Chief a final lesson about sacrificing a life for the greater good, or saving every single life possible. In Johnson's case, the Master Chief had the option to give just the combat data on the Flood, or give the complete data including Johnson's freak accident survival. At the end of First Strike, the Master Chief chose to give the regular combat data. Furthermore, only five of the original Spartans are in active service: Linda (Spartan-058), who was revived by Dr. Halsey's medical care and organ transplants, Fred (Spartan-104), Will (Spartan-043), and John himself. Kelly, Spartan-087, is still alive but has been kidnapped by Dr. Halsey for purposes unknown, in the book stated as a "private mission." All other Spartans are either [[missing in action]] (MIA) or confirmed [[killed in action]] (KIA); however, dead SPARTANs are listed as [[Missing in action]] or WIA (Wounded in Action) to maintain the illusion that Spartans cannot die, in an effort to give the human race hope and to boost [[morale]].

In addition to the five Spartans mentioned above, there are in fact three other Spartans designated "Gray Team" who were otherwise engaged on fields of combat too distant to be easily recalled, when the Spartans were gathered on the ''Pillar of Autumn'', prior to the fall of Reach and the events on [[Installation 04]]. They may have since fallen to Covenant forces since Gray Team never contacted Command for a year according to [[Halo: Ghosts of Onyx]].

===''Halo 2''===
{{see also|Halo 2}}
Upon arriving back on Earth, the Master Chief's heavily damaged Mark V MJOLNIR armor was replaced by the newer Mark VI model (recently field-tested by SPARTAN-062 Maria), based on improvements made to the Covenant technology used in the Mark V. Will, Fred, and Linda are un-accounted for, but it is heavily speculated that they are undergoing extensive medical recovery. The Master Chief attended a brief awards ceremony aboard Cairo Station [[defense platform]], which was rudely interrupted by a Covenant invasion force, comprised of an unusually small fleet of ships. The Covenant boarded Cairo Station, but were repelled by the Master Chief and the UNSC troops. He destroyed one of their ships with their own bomb intended to destroy the station, and reached the ''In Amber Clad'' which descended to [[New Mombasa, East African Protectorate|New Mombasa]] to combat Covenant ground forces. He cleared the city then boarded and destroyed a massive Scarab walker with the assistance of a small squad of Marines. As the Covenant departed using a [[slipspace]] jump within the city, the ''In Amber Clad'' followed them to [[Installation 05]] - another Halo. It wasn't until the Master Chief's disappearance that Will, Fred, and Linda assisted in defending Earth for two weeks, until the three SPARTANs were requested to head to Onyx under Lord Hood's orders.

Master Chief and a small squad of [[ODST]]s landed on this new Halo, and the Master Chief [[assassination|assassinated]] the Covenant [[High Prophets (Halo)|High Prophet]] of Regret, which triggered the removal of the Elites' position as the bodyguards of the Prophets.

John was rescued by the [[Gravemind]], an intelligence of Flood origin, after barely escaping from the High Prophet's main temple and met his Covenant Elite counterpart, the [[Arbiter (Halo)|Arbiter]]. Gravemind had a secret agenda and sent the two soldiers to stop the Prophet Hierarchs from activating Delta Halo. (Even without Installation 04, the devastation caused by the remaining six rings would still be apocalyptic, destroying both races and much of the Flood's food sources) Gravemind sent the Master Chief to infiltrate [[High Charity]], the Covenant capital city-ship, while the Arbiter went to try and stop [[Tartarus (Halo)|Tartarus]], on the surface of Delta Halo itself. As the Chief distracted the Covenant on High Charity, who were already embroiled in a civil war of their own, the Gravemind hijacked the ''In Amber Clad'', filled it with Flood combat forms, and Slipspace jumped the unlucky ship into High Charity. Out of the wreckage spilled a Flood invasion force.

John followed the Prophet of Truth to a Forerunner ship through waves of Flood Combat Forms and managed to board it before it embarked for Earth, though he was forced to abandon Cortana on High Charity so that she could destroy In Amber Clad's nuclear reactor in order to prevent Tartarus from activating Delta Halo.

===''Halo 3''===

Very little is known currently about the Master Chief's role in Halo 3. The Halo 3 announcement trailer has placed him at New Mombasa, before a massive Forerunner artifact and surrounded by Covenant ships and aircraft. A video documentary released by Bungie showing Halo 3 alpha-version screens and gameplay shows a character with Spartan arms and human weaponry battling Brutes in various human industrial locations, presumably on Earth.

==Appearances in other media==
* While developing ''[[Dead or Alive 4]]'', [[Team Ninja]] originally approached Bungie asking to use the Master Chief in their game. While this proved impossible, due to storyline restrictions, Bungie's interest in the idea resulted in the development of [[Nicole (Dead or Alive character)|Nicole (Spartan-458)]], a character that is seemingly unrelated to the ''Halo'' storyline that could conveniently (and somewhat plausibly) be inserted into the ''DOA'' universe. Nicole-458 was inserted into the DOA universe when Bungie acknowledged the [[I Love Bees]] game as [[canon (fiction)|canon]], permitting the time traveling Nicole to be inserted into present day reality.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}
* Master Chief's Helmet is an unlockable item for Character Creation mode in ''[[Blinx 2: Masters of Time and Space]]''.
* Master Chief is mentioned in the first episode of the ''Halo''-based [[machinima]] series ''[[Red vs. Blue]]''. While talking to Simmons, Grif says, "I signed up to fight some aliens. Next thing I know, Master Chief blows up the whole Covenant Armada, and I'm stuck in the middle of nowhere, fighting [[List of characters in Red vs. Blue#Blue Team|a bunch of blue guys]]."<ref>RvB Episode 1: "[[Red vs. Blue (season 1)#Episode 1|Why Are We Here?]]"</ref> Thus giving some explanation to the setting.
