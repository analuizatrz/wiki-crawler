==History==
{{main|History of Ann Arbor, Michigan}}
Ann Arbor was founded in January 1824 by John Allen and Elisha Rumsey, both of whom were land speculators. There are various accounts concerning the origin of the settlement's name; one states that Allen and Rumsey decided to name it "Annarbour" for their spouses, both named Ann, and for the stands of [[bur oak|burr oak]] in the 640 [[acre]]s (260&nbsp;[[hectare|ha]]) of land they had purchased for [[United States dollar|$]]800 from the federal government.<ref name="city_name_origin" /> The regional [[Native Americans (U.S.)|Native Americans]] named the settlement ''Kaw-goosh-kaw-nick'', after the sound of Allen's saw mill.

Ann Arbor became the seat of Washtenaw County in 1827, and was incorporated as a village in 1833. The Ann Arbor Land Company, a group of speculators, set aside 40&nbsp;acres (16&nbsp;ha) of undeveloped land and offered it to the State of Michigan as the site of the state capital, but lost the bid to [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]]. In 1837, the property was accepted instead as the site of the [[University of Michigan]], forever linking Ann Arbor and its history with the university.<ref>{{cite book | title=A History of Ann Arbor | author=Marwil, Jonathan | year=[[June 15]] [[1991]] | publisher=University of Michigan Press | id=ISBN 0-472-06463-0|pages=13}}</ref> The town became a regional transportation hub in 1839 with the arrival of the [[Michigan Central Railroad]], and in 1851 Ann Arbor was chartered as a city.

During [[World War II]], [[Ford Motor Company]]'s nearby [[Willow Run]] plant turned out [[B-24 Liberator]] bombers. The population of Ann Arbor exploded with an influx of military personnel, war workers, and their families.

During the 1960s and 1970s, the city gained a reputation as an important center for liberal politics. Presidential candidate [[John F. Kennedy]] unveiled his [[Peace Corps]] proposal in 1960 at the University of Michigan, and President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] first called for a "[[Great Society]]" as the university's commencement speaker in 1964.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://moaa.aadl.org/PictHistory/1940-1974pg4.php | title=1940–1974: Progress and Preservation. ''Pictorial History of Ann Arbor: 1824–1974'' | year=2003 | publisher=Ann Arbor District Library | accessdate=2007-02-19}}</ref> The city also became a locus for left-wing activism, and served as a hub for the [[American civil rights movement|civil-rights movement]] and [[Opposition to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War movement]], as well as the student movement. The first major meetings of the national left-wing campus group [[Students for a Democratic Society]] took place in Ann Arbor in 1960; in 1965, the city was home to the first U.S. [[teach-in]] against the [[Vietnam War]].<ref name="history">{{cite web | url=http://moaa.aadl.org/PictHistory/1940-1974pg3.php | title=1940–1974: From Protest to Outer Space. ''Pictorial History of Ann Arbor: 1824–1974'' | year=2003 | publisher=Ann Arbor District Library | accessdate=2007-02-19}}</ref> During the ensuing fifteen years, many [[counterculture|countercultural]] and [[New Left]] enterprises sprang up and developed strong constituencies within the city.

[[Image:SouthU.jpg|thumb|South University Avenue caters to young people.]]
These influences washed into municipal politics during the early and mid-1970s when three members of the local, progressive [[Human Rights Party (United States)|Human Rights Party]] (HRP) won city-council seats on the strength of the student vote. During their time on the council, HRP representatives fought for measures including pioneering [[civil rights|antidiscrimination]] ordinances, [[Marijuana laws in Ann Arbor, Michigan|measures decriminalizing marijuana possession]], and a [[rent control|rent-control]] ordinance;<ref name="HRP">{{cite web | author=Restivo, Terrence R. | url=http://etd1.library.duq.edu/theses/available/etd-03312006-154729/unrestricted/RestivoThesis.pdf | title=The Building of a New Left Conglomerate in the City of Ann Arbor: VOICE, Action Movement and the Human Rights Party (1965–1975) | format=pdf | date=[[March 22]] [[2006]] | publisher=McAnulty College and Graduate School of Liberal Arts, Duquesne University | accessdate=2007-05-08}}</ref> many of these remain in effect in modified form.

Alongside these liberal and left-wing efforts, a small group of conservative institutions were born in Ann Arbor. These include [[Word of God (community)|Word of God]] (established in 1967), a charismatic inter-denominational movement of national scope;<ref name="history" /> and the [[Thomas More Law Center]] (established in 1999), a leading religious-conservative advocacy group.

The economy of Ann Arbor underwent a gradual shift from a manufacturing base to a service and technology base during the 20th century, which accelerated in the 1970s and 1980s. At the same time, the downtown transformed from one dominated by retail establishments dealing in staple goods to one composed mainly of eateries, cafés, bars, clubs, and specialty shops. Over the past several decades, Ann Arbor has increasingly found itself grappling with the effects of sharply rising land values and [[gentrification]], as well as [[urban sprawl]] stretching far into the outlying countryside. On [[November 4]], [[2003]], voters approved a [[greenbelt]] plan under which the city government would buy development rights to pieces of land adjacent to Ann Arbor to preserve them from sprawling development.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.a2openspace.org/ | title=Ann Arbor Parks and Greenbelt Proposal | date=[[March 2]] [[2004]] | publisher=Friends of Ann Arbor Open Space | accessdate=2007-04-29}}</ref> Since then, a vociferous local debate has hinged on whether, and how, to accommodate and guide development within city limits.

==Geography and cityscape==
[[Image:NicholsArb.JPG|thumb|right|Ann Arbor's many trees are the result of a reforestation campaign in the early 20th century.]]
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has an area of 27.7&nbsp;[[square mile]]s (71.7&nbsp;[[square kilometre|km²]]); 27.0&nbsp;square miles (70.0&nbsp;km²) is land and 0.7 square miles (1.7&nbsp;km²) or 2.42% is water, much of which is part of the [[Huron River (Michigan)|Huron River]]. Ann Arbor is about 40&nbsp;[[mile]]s (64&nbsp;[[kilometre|km]]) west of [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]]. [[Ann Arbor Charter Township, Michigan|Ann Arbor Charter Township]] is adjacent, on the city's north and east sides. Ann Arbor is situated on the [[Huron River (Michigan)|Huron River]], in a productive agricultural and fruit-growing region. The landscape of Ann Arbor consists of hills and [[valley]]s, with the terrain becoming steeper near the Huron River. The elevation ranges from about 750&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|feet]] (230&nbsp;[[metre|m]]) along the Huron River to over 1,000&nbsp;feet (305&nbsp;m) on the city's west side near I-94.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?lat=42.27083&lon=-83.72639 | title=Ann Arbor, USGS Ann Arbor East (MI) Topo Map | publisher=TopoZone | year=2005 | accessdate=2005-06-15}}</ref> Generally, the west-central and northwestern parts of the city, and UM's North Campus, are the highest parts of the city; the lowest parts are along the Huron River and in the southeast. The elevation is about 839&nbsp;feet (256&nbsp;m) at Ann Arbor Municipal Airport, which is located south of the city at {{coor dm|42|13.38|N|83|44.74|W|region:US}}.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.airnav.com/airport/KARB | title=KARB &ndash; Ann Arbor Municipal Airport | pubisher=AirNav | date=[[March 15]] [[2007]] | accessdate=2007-05-08}}</ref>

Ann Arbor's "Tree Town" nickname stems from the dense forestation of its parks and residential areas. The city holds more than 50,000 trees sited along city streets and an equal number in city parks.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.annarbor.org/aboutannarbor/funfacts.asp | title=Fun Facts | year=2005 | publisher=Ann Arbor Area Convention and Visitor's Bureau | accessdate=2005-09-06}}</ref> In recent years, the [[emerald ash borer]] has destroyed many of the city's approximately 10,500 [[ash tree]]s. The city contains 147 municipal parks, ranging from small neighborhood parks to large recreation areas, with several large city parks and a university park bordering sections of the Huron River.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.a2gov.org/CommunityServices/Parks/parks.html | title=Parks | year=2007 | publisher=Ann Arbor City Government | accessdate=2007-04-29}}</ref> The largest are Argo Park, Riverside Park, County Farm Park, and Gallup Park (near the Huron Parkway),<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.a2gov.org/CommunityServices/Parks/parklistings_1.html | title=Ann Arbor Park Listings and Features | year=2007 | publisher=Ann Arbor City Government | accessdate=2007-04-29}}</ref> while Fuller Recreation Area, near the [[University of Michigan Health System|University Hospital]] complex, contains sports fields, pedestrian and [[bike path]]s, and swimming pools.  [[Nichols Arboretum]], which is operated by the [[University of Michigan]] (and known locally as "The Arboretum" or simply "The Arb"), is a 123-acre (50&nbsp;[[hectare|ha]]) preserve containing hundreds of plant and tree species on the east side of the city near the university's central campus.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.michigan.org/travel/detail.asp?m=9;1&p=G5293 | title=Nichols Arboretum - University of Michigan | publisher=Michigan Economic Development Corporation (Michigan.org) | date=2007 | accessdate=2007-11-15}}</ref>

The Kerrytown Shops, Main Street Business District, the State Street Business District, and the South University Business District are commercial areas in downtown. Three commercial areas south of downtown include the areas near [[Interstate 94|I-94]] and Ann Arbor-Saline Road, [[Briarwood Mall]], and the South Industrial area. Other commercial areas include the Arborland/Washtenaw Avenue and Packard Road merchants on the east side, the Plymouth Road area in the northeast, and the Westgate/West Stadium areas on the west side. The downtown contains a mix of 19th and early 20th century structures and modern-style buildings, as well as a [[farmers' market]] in the Kerrytown district.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.a2gov.org/CommunityServices/Parks/Farmers%20Market/farmers_main.html | title=Ann Arbor Farmers' Market | year=2007 | publisher=Ann Arbor City Government | accessdate=2007-04-29}}</ref> The city's commercial districts are composed mostly of two to four-story structures, although the downtown and the area near Briarwood Mall contain a small number of high-rise buildings.

Ann Arbor's residential neighborhoods contain a range of architectural styles, from classic 19th and early 20th century designs to [[ranch-style house]]s. Contemporary-style houses are farther from the downtown district. Surrounding the University of Michigan campus are houses and apartment complexes occupied primarily by student renters. [[Tower Plaza]], a 26-story condominium building located between the University of Michigan campus and downtown, is the tallest building in Ann Arbor.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=towerplaza-annarbor-mi-usa | title=Tower Plaza, Ann Arbor | publisher=Emporis Buildings | year=2007 | accessdate=2007-08-25}}</ref> The 19th century buildings and streetscape of the Old West Side neighborhood have been preserved virtually intact; in 1972, the district was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], and it is further protected by city ordinances and a nonprofit preservation group.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.oldwestside.org/ | title=Neighborhood Association | publisher=Old West Side Association | year=2007 | accessdate=2006-06-04}}</ref>

There are four seasons, with winters being cold with moderate [[snowfall]] while summers can be warm and humid. The area experiences [[lake effect]], primarily in the form of increased cloudiness during late fall and early winter.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.michiganvacations.com/regions/Ann-Arbor-Michigan.html | title=Ann Arbor | publisher=MichiganVacations.com | year=2005 | accessdate=2005-08-18}}</ref> The highest average temperature is in July at 83&nbsp;°[[Fahrenheit|F]] (28&nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]]) while the lowest average temperature is in January at 16&nbsp;°F (−9&nbsp;°C).

[[Image:AACityHall.JPG|thumb|The Guy C. Larcom, Jr. Municipal Building houses the city hall and police station]]
Ann Arbor has a [[Council-manager government|Council-manager]] form of government. The mayor, who is elected every even-numbered year, is the presiding officer of the City Council and has the power to appoint all Council committee members as well as board and commission members, with the approval of the City Council. The mayor of Ann Arbor is [[John Hieftje]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]), who has served in that capacity since the 2000 election. The city council has ten members, two from each of the city's five wards, with the mayor wielding the tie-breaking vote. Council members serve two-year terms; half the council is elected in annual elections.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.a2gov.org/citycouncil/index.html | title=Government | year=2007 | publisher=Ann Arbor City Council | accessdate=2007-04-29}}</ref>  City operations are managed by the [[City Administrator]], who is chosen by the city council.

Left-wing politics have been particularly strong in municipal government since the 1960s – an orientation evident in the passage of strong [[civil rights|antidiscrimination]] ordinances. Voters also approved charter amendments that have [[Marijuana laws in Ann Arbor, Michigan|lessened the penalties]] for possession of marijuana (1974), and that aim to protect access to [[abortion]] in the city should it ever become illegal in the State of Michigan (1990).<ref>{{cite journal | author=Marshall, Steve | title=City Hopes to Thwart Michigan on Abortion Law | journal=USA Today | date=[[February 14]] [[1990]] | pages=3A}}</ref> In 1974, [[Kathy Kozachenko]]'s victory in an Ann Arbor city-council race made her the country's first openly [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] candidate to win public office.<ref>{{cite web | author= Cohen-Vrignaud, Gerard | url=http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1999/feb/02-12-99/news/news18.html | title=Gay and Proud | publisher=The Michigan Daily | date=[[February 12]] [[1999]] | accessdate=2007-05-05}}</ref> In 1975, Ann Arbor became the first U.S. city to use [[instant-runoff voting]] for a mayoral race.

Several major companies are headquartered in Ann Arbor. [[Borders Books]], originally a two-room shop upstairs above 211 South State, was opened in 1969 with a stock of used books by brothers Tom and Louis Borders. The shop soon moved to a storefront in the Maynard House building on East William, and soon after that, in 1971,  returned to State Street and a ground-floor location where the Red Hawk Grill is now. The brothers then switched to selling new books, and moved a few years later to larger quarters across the street. They began operating other outlets around the region in 1985. The Borders chain is still based in the city, as is its flagship store (now in yet another location). Dogs are allowed inside the flagship store, and the cashiers have a stock of treats for such visitors.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Blakeley, Pam | year=2005–2006 | title=[http://www.ecurrent.com/ag/2005/feat/dogging05.php Doggin' Around Ann Arbor] | journal=Ann Arbor Guide 2005–6 | accessdate=2007-02-18}}</ref> [[Domino's Pizza]]'s headquarters is near Ann Arbor on Domino's Farms, a 271-acre (109 hectare) [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]-inspired complex just northeast of the city.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dominosfarms.com/visibility.php | title=Distinction and Visibility | publisher=Domino's Farms Office Park | year=2006 | accessdate=2006-06-04}}</ref> Flint Ink Corp., another Ann Arbor-based company, was until recently the world's largest privately held ink manufacturer (in October 2005, it was acquired by Stuttgart-based XSYS Print Solutions).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.flintgrp.com/FlintGroupPressRelease.nsf/0/49F3D7414F165D04852571BF005D9867?OpenDocument | title=Flint Ink and XSYS Print Solutions Agree to Merge | publisher=Flint Group | date=[[July 20]] [[2005]] | accessdate=2007-05-08}}</ref> Another Ann Arbor-based company is [[Zingerman's|Zingerman's Delicatessen]], which serves sandwiches and Jewish foods, and has developed businesses under a variety of brand names.

A downtown bus depot served by [[Greyhound Lines]] provides out-of-town bus service, and is the city's only remaining example of the [[Streamline Moderne]] architectural style.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Brandt, Karen L. | url=http://www.daads.org/modern/1802/article07.htm | title=Ann Arbor Bus Depot | journal=The Modern | date=Fall 2005/Winter 2006 | volume=18 | number=2 | accessdate=2007-05-05}}</ref> [[Megabus]] has twice daily direct service to [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]], while a bus service provided by [[Amtrak]] connects to [[East Lansing, Michigan|East Lansing]] and [[Toledo, Ohio]], though only for rail passengers making connections.

[[Ann Arbor Municipal Airport]] is a small [[general aviation]] [[airport]] located south of [[Interstate 94|I-94]]. [[Detroit Metropolitan Airport]], the area's large [[international airport]], is about 28&nbsp;miles (45&nbsp;km) east of the city, in [[Romulus, Michigan|Romulus]]. [[Willow Run Airport]] in nearby Ypsilanti serves freight, corporate, and general aviation clients.

The city was a major rail hub, notably for freight traffic between [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] and ports north of [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]], from [[1878]] to [[1982]]; however, the [[Ann Arbor Railroad]] also sold 1.1 million passenger tickets in [[1913]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://clarke.cmich.edu/michrailroads/building.htm | title=Michigan's Ann Arbor Railroads  &mdash; Building the Ann Arbor | publisher=Central Michigan University &mdash; Clarke Historical Library | year=December 8, 2005 | accessdate=2005-09-01}}</ref> The city was also served by the [[Michigan Central Railroad]] starting in [[1837]]. [[Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti Street Railway]], Michigan's first [[interurban]], served the city from [[1891]] to [[1929]]. [[Amtrak]] provides service to Ann Arbor, operating its [[Wolverine (passenger train)|Wolverine]] three times daily in each direction between Chicago and [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]], via [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]]. Rail service is provided at the [[Ann Arbor (Amtrak station)|Ann Arbor Train Station]]; the present-day station neighbors the city's old Michigan Central Depot, which was renovated as a restaurant in [[1969]]. There have been plans to build a [[SEMCOG Commuter Rail|commuter rail]] link between Ann Arbor and Detroit, with the U.S. federal government providing [[United States dollar|$]]100 million to enable its development.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Mulcahy, John | year=[[August 28]] [[2005]] | url=http://www.mlive.com/news/aanews/index.ssf?/base/news-14/112522397069040.xml&;coll=2 | title=Is commuter rail finally on fast track?
