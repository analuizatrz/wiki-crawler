The '''Severn Tunnel''' ({{lang-cy|Twnnel Hafren}}) is a [[railway]] [[tunnel]] in the [[United Kingdom]], linking [[South Gloucestershire]] in the west of [[England]] to [[Monmouthshire]] in south [[Wales]] under the [[estuary]] of the [[River Severn]].

Built by the [[Great Western Railway]] (GWR) between 1873 and 1886, it is 4&nbsp;miles 624&nbsp;yd (7,008&nbsp;m) long, and was the longest mainline railway tunnel within the UK for well over 100 years until the two major [[High Speed 1]] tunnels (London East and West) were opened as part of the [[CTRL]] in November 2007. Only 2¼&nbsp;miles (3.62&nbsp;km) of the tunnel are actually under the river.

===Construction===
Prior to the building of the tunnel, communications between the [[Bristol]] area and South Wales were primarily by boat. With the coming of the railway, services were forced to either take a long detour via [[Gloucester]], or, from 1863, to use the [[Bristol and South Wales Union Railway]], which involved a ferry crossing. The GWR proposed to drive a tunnel under "The Shoots", a relatively narrow but unusually deep section of the estuary. This meant steep gradients by railway standards in order to reach the required depth.

Work on the tunnel began in March 1873, and proceeded gradually through the 1870s. As Thomas Walker notes in his book, GWR had expected the critical part of the work to be the tunnelling under the deep-water channel of the Shoots. However, the builders' real difficulties began in October 1879. At this stage, when only 130&nbsp;yards (119&nbsp;m) remained separating the main  tunnel heading being driven from the Welsh side, and the shorter Gloucestershire heading, the workings were inundated, from a large fresh-water source ("The Great Spring") tapped by the heading being driven inland on the Welsh side.

[[Thomas A. Walker]] was the contractor entrusted by the chief GWR engineer Sir [[John Hawkshaw]] with rescuing and completing the tunnel after the 1879 flooding. Holding the Great Spring in check required the installation of greatly increased pumping facilities, and a diver had to be sent down a shaft and 300&nbsp;m along the tunnel heading to close a door in the workings and seal off the waters. This troublesome task was finally achieved in November 1880 by lead diver [[Alexander Lambert]] using [[Henry Fluess|Henry Fluess']] new [[self contained breathing apparatus]], but work in the area of the Great Spring was unable to continue until January 1881 when the Great Spring was temporarily sealed off. Work was later disrupted in 1883 by further flooding from the Great Spring, and again Lambert managed to save the day. Additional mishaps afflicting the workings included a large tidal wave and a breakthrough of the bed of a pool (the "Salmon Pool") on the English side. In the intervening period the [[Severn Railway Bridge]] from [[Sharpness]] to [[Lydney]] was opened.

The tunnel was completed during 1885 and a goods train passed through it on 9 January 1886, but regular services had to wait until the pumping systems were complete. The tunnel opened to goods trains in September and to passenger traffic in December 1886, nearly 14 years after work had started. Fixed [[steam engine]]s pumped out the Great Spring and other sources of water until the 1960s, when they were replaced by electrically powered pumps.

In the 1930s the availability of the reliable fresh water supply from the Great Spring led to the choice of site for the [[Royal Navy Propellant Factory, Caerwent]].

=== Car transport ===
In 1924 the [[Great Western Railway]] started a service to transport cars on rail trucks through the tunnel between [[Pilning railway station|Pilning]] and [[Severn Tunnel Junction]].  The service was an alternative to the [[Aust Ferry]], which had an erratic timetable determined by the tides, or the long road journey via Gloucester.  The service continued after the war, but was made redundant by the opening of the [[Severn Bridge]] in 1966<ref>Nock, O.S. (1967) ''History of the Great Western Railway'' Volume III p.42</ref>.

===World War 2===
During [[World War II]], a Great Western Railway passenger train was pursued by a German aircraft along the main line to Wales.  Reaching speeds estimated at {{convert|90|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, well above the wartime restrictions in place, the train successfully escaped into the tunnel and stopped beneath the river until the driver judged that the danger had passed.  The train was struck by several bullets during the chase but there were no serious injuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059825/trivia|title=The Train (1964) - Trivia|publisher=imdb.com |accessdate=2007-07-08 |quote=The sequence in which Burt Lancaster evades an air attack on his locomotive by driving at full speed into a tunnel was based on an attack on the Great Western Railway during the war.}}</ref>

===Present day===
The Second Road Crossing (usually but slightly misleadingly called the [[Second Severn Crossing]]), crosses over the tunnel on a "ground level bridge" on the English side, (near the Salmon Pool), supported in such a way that no load is imposed on the tunnel. The opportunity  was taken to renew the concrete cap above the tunnel in the Salmon Pool during bridge construction.

There is also a second tunnel under the river just upstream near this point, carrying a high-capacity electricity cable ([[National Grid UK|SuperGrid]]) under the river, complementing the earlier high-capacity [[Aust Severn Powerline Crossing]], which is carried over the river by pylons just downstream of the original [[Severn Bridge]]. Both electricity links were originally commissioned by the [[CEGB]].

As the tunnel has aged, every Sunday the tunnel is closed to allow teams of engineers in to carry out vital work to ensure the safety of the passengers that use it. On several occasions, it has closed immediately after drivers of various trains have reported hearing their trains hit items on the track.

The tunnel is severely congested, and freight from South Wales ports to southern England is often routed via Gloucester.
