The '''ghost fungus''' (''Omphalotus nidiformis'') is a gill [[mushroom]] most notable for its [[bioluminescence|bioluminescent]] properties.  Previous names include ''Pleurotus nidiformis'' and ''Pleurotus  lampas''. It is [[poison]]ous.  While not lethal, consuming this mushroom leads to very severe [[cramp]]s, [[vomit]]ing, and [[diarrhea]].   

It occurs in south western [[Western Australia]] and south eastern Australia, from eastern [[South Australia]] through to southeast [[Queensland]]. It also occurs in [[Tasmania]].

Its bioluminescence is only observable in low-light conditions when the [[eye]] develops [[night vision]]. 


== Description ==
The fruiting body of the ghost fungus can be found on dead or diseased wood, where it causes white heart rot. A saprobe or parasite, it is nonspecific in its needs and can be found on native ''[[Banksia]]'', ''[[Hakea]]'' and various [[Myrtaceae]] as well as introduced tree species.
The cap is generally cream in colour, though often tinted with orange, brownish, greyish or purple shades. Growning up to 25 cm in diameter it is funnel-shaped or fan-shaped in appearance. The cream-white gills are decurrent and often drip with moisture. The thin flesh is creamy white in colour. There is no distinctive smell or taste.

==Similar Species==
The similarly poisonous mushroom '''Tsukiyotake''' (''[[Omphalotus japonicus]]'' (Kawam.) Kirchm. & O.K. Mill., aka ''Lampteromyces japonicus'' (Kawam.) Sing.) found in [[Japan]] and eastern [[Asia]], and the North American jack o'lantern mushroom (''[[Omphalotus olearius]]'') emit light similar to that of the ghost fungus. It was confirmed that Tsukiyotake was a relative of jack o'lantern mushroom in [[2003]]. The poisonous western jack o'lantern mushroom, ''[[Omphalotus olivascens]]'' is abundant in South & Central California.
