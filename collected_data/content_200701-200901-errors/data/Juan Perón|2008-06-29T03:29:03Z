'''Juan Domingo Perón Sosa''' ([[October 8]], [[1895]] &ndash; [[July 1]], [[1974]]) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[colonel]] and [[politician]], elected three times as [[President of Argentina]], after serving in several government positions including Labor Secretary and Vice President. He returned to power in 1973 and served for nine months, until his death in 1974 when he was succeeded by his third wife [[Isabel Martinez de Perón|Isabel Martínez]]. 

Perón and his second wife, [[Eva Perón|Eva]], were immensely popular amongst many of the Argentine people and are still considered icons by the [[Peronist Party]]. The Peróns' followers praised their efforts to eliminate [[poverty]] and to dignify labor, while their detractors considered them [[Demagogy|demagogues]] and [[dictator]]s. The Peróns gave their name to the political movement known as [[Peronism]], which is followed by the [[Justicialist Party]].

==Childhood and youth==
Perón was born near [[Lobos]], [[Province of Buenos Aires]].  He was the son of Mario Tomás Perón, a farmer whose family was partly [[Scottish people|Scottish]] and [[Italian people|Italian]], and Juana Sosa, of [[Spanish people|Spanish]] descent.
<!--- Research undertaken by the Argentine journalist and writer [[Tomás Eloy Martínez]], reported in his books "Memoirs of the General" and "The Perón Novel", indicate that Perón was probably illegitimate.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}  When his parents married, they acknowledged Juan and his brother.  It is believed this information was denied for years because it would have likely ruined Perón's career. -->

Perón married his first wife, [[Aurelia Tizón]], on [[January 5]], [[1929]], but she died of [[uterine cancer]] nine years later.  He called her "Potota."

Perón received a strict [[Catholic]] upbringing.  He entered military school at 16, and after graduation he progressed through the ranks.  In 1938 he was sent to [[Italy]], [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Albania]] and [[Yugoslavia]] as a military observer, and  became familiar with [[Benito Mussolini]]'s government and other European governments of the time.

==Military government of 1943-1946==
In May 1943, as a [[colonel]], he took a significant part in the [[military coup]] by the GOU ([[United Officers' Group]]), a secret society, against the conservative civilian government of [[Ramón Castillo]].  At first an assistant to [[Secretary of War]] General [[Edelmiro Farrell]], under the administration of General [[Pedro Ramírez]], he later became the head of the then-insignificant [[Department of Labor]].
[[Image:17deoctubre-enlafuente.jpg|thumb|left|Demonstration for Perón's release, on October 17th, 1945.]]
Perón's work in the Labor Department led to an alliance with the [[socialist]] and [[syndicalism|syndicalist]] movements in the Argentine [[labor union]]s. This caused his power and influence to increase in the military government<ref>{{es icon}}

.  After the coup, socialists from the labor union [[General Confederation of Labour (Argentina)|CGT]] Nº1, made contact with Colonels Perón and [[Mercante]] through the mercantile labor leader [[Borlenghi]] and the [[railroad]] union [[lawyer]] [[Juan Bramuglia]].  They established an alliance to promote labor laws that had long been demanded by the workers' movement, strengthen the unions, and transform the Department of Labor into a more significant government office. <!--Perón's position as head of the Department of Labor was elevated to a cabinet-level secretariat in November of 1943. (Baily,84; López, 401) -->

In February 1945, Peron became Vice President and Secretary of War under General [[Edelmiro Farrell]]. Forced to resign by opponents within the [[armed forces]] on [[October 9]], [[1945]], Perón was arrested, but mass [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] organized by the CGT [[trade union]] federation forced his release on [[October 17]]. Four days later, he married his second wife, [[Eva Duarte de Perón|Eva Duarte]], who became hugely popular.  Known as Evita, she helped her husband gain support with labor and women's groups.

==Election as president and first term (1946-1952)==
Perón leveraged his popular support to victory in the [[February 24]], [[1946]] presidential elections. 

Once in office, Perón pursued policies aimed at empowering the working class.  He greatly expanded the number of unionized workers, and strengthened the [[General Confederation of Labour (Argentina)|General Confederation of Labour (CGT)]], created in 1930. He called these policies the "third position", between capitalism and communism.  Perón also pushed industrialization hard; in 1947 he announced the first [[Five-year plans of Argentina|five-year plan]] to boost newly nationalized industries.  [[Peronism]] became a major force in Argentine politics, and Perón continued to exert a strong influence after the 1955 [[Revolución Libertadora|military uprising]] forced him into exile.

[[Image:Perón (El Obrero Ferroviario).jpeg|thumb|left|Peron on the cover of a magazine in 1945]]Among upper-class Argentines, improvement of the workers' situation was a source of resentment; industrial workers from rural areas had formerly been treated as servants.  It was common for better-off Argentines to refer to these workers using racist slurs like "little black heads" (''cabecitas negras'', the name of a bird), "greased" (''grasas'' which came from people with grease in their hands/fingernails ie blue-collar), "un-shirted" (''descamisados'', since they "took off their jackets and/or shirts"). The [[Radical Civic Union|radical]] deputy [[Ernesto Sammartino]] said that people who vote for Perón were a "zoological flood" (''aluvión zoológico'').<ref>[http://ricardobalbin.tripod.com/los44.htm Quoted by Hugo Gambini in his book "Historia del peronismo"] He said, in Spanish: ''"El '''aluvión zoológico''' del 24 de febrero parece haber arrojado a algún diputado a su banca, para que desde ella maúlle a los astros por una dieta de 2.500 pesos.  Que siga maullando, que a mí no me molesta..."''</ref>  In the 1940s upper-class students were the first to oppose Peronist workers, with the slogan: "No to [[espadrille]] dictatorship" (''No a la dictadura de las alpargatas'').  A graffito revealing the strong opposition between Peronists and anti-Peronists appeared in upper-class districts in the 1950s, "Long live cancer!" (''¡Viva el cáncer!''), when Eva Perón was dying of cancer.<ref>[http://www.elhistoriador.com.ar/frases/evaperon/vivaelcancer.php Eduardo Galeano , Memorias del Fuego , México, Siglo XXI, 1990]</ref>  She died of [[uterine cancer]] in 1952 at the age of thirty-three.<ref>Lerner, BH (2000).  The illness and death of Eva Perón: cancer, politics, and secrecy. Lancet 355:1988-1991</ref>

Weiss (2005, p.45) recalls events in the universities:
<blockquote>"As a young student in Buenos Aires in the early 1950s, I well remember the graffiti found on many an empty wall all over town: "Build the Fatherland. Kill a Student" (''Haga patria, mate un estudiante''). [Perón] opposed the universities, which questioned his methods and his goals.  A well-remembered slogan was, ''Alpargatas sí, libros no'' ('[[peon]] footwear [=espadrilles]  yes, books no'). Universities were [then] 'intervened'.  In some, a ''Peronista'' mediocrity was appointed rector.  Others were closed for years."</blockquote>

[[Image:Peron y Eva - Acto en Plaza de Mayo -17OCT1951.jpg|thumb|right|Evita and Juan Peron at the [[Plaza de Mayo]], 1951]]Between 1947 and 1950, Argentina manufactured two advanced jet aircraft called [[I.Ae. 27 Pulqui I|Pulqui I]] (designed by the Argentine engineers Cardehilac, Morchio and Ricciardi with the French [[Emile Dewoitine]], condemned in France in absentia for [[Collaborationism]]), and [[FMA IAe 33 Pulqui II|Pulqui II]] designed by [[Kurt Tank]]. In the test flights, the planes were flown by Lieutenant Edmundo Osvaldo Weiss and Kurt Tank himself, reaching 1000 km/h with the Pulqui II.  Argentina continued testing the Pulqui II until 1959; in the tests, two pilots lost their lives.<ref>[http://www.lucheyvuelve.com.ar/pulqui/pulqui1.htm El proyecto Pulqui: propaganda peronista de la época]</ref>  The Pulqui project opened the door to two successful Argentinian planes: [http://www.choiquehobbies.com.ar/revista/notas/pucara/Pucara.htm I.A.58"Pucara] and the [http://www.fuerzaaerea.mil.ar/material/pampa.html I.A.63'Pampa] manufactured at the Aircraft Factory of Córdoba.<ref>http://www.reconstruccion2005.com.ar/0412/aviacion.htm La aviación militar apunta a Cordoba
como vector comercial del poder aéreo</ref> 

In 1951, Perón announced that the [[Huemul Project]] would produce nuclear fusion before any other country.  The project was led by an Austrian, [[Ronald Richter]], who had been recommended by Kurt Tank. Tank expected to power his aircraft with Richter's invention.  Perón announced that energy produced by the fusion process would be delivered in milk-bottle sized containers.  Richter announced success in 1951, but no proof was given.  The next year, Perón appointed a scientific team to investigate Richter's activities.  Reports by [[José Antonio Balseiro]] and Mario Báncora revealed that the project was a fraud.  After that, the Huemul Project was transferred to the Centro Atómico Bariloche (CAB) of the Argentine [[National Atomic Energy Commission]] (CNEA) and to the physics institute of the [[Universidad Nacional de Cuyo]], later named [[Instituto Balseiro]] (IB). 

=== Protection of Nazi war criminals ===
{{see|Ratlines (history)}}
After World War II, Argentina became a leading haven for Nazi war criminals, with explicit protection from Perón. [[Uki Goñi]] showed in his 1998 book that Nazis and French and Belgian [[collaborationists]], including [[Pierre Daye]], organized a meeting in the ''[[Casa Rosada]]'' with Perón. In this meeting, a network was created with support by the Immigration Service and foreign office. The Swiss Chief of Police Heinrich Rothmund [http://www.millersville.edu/~holo-con/epstein.html] and the Croatian Roman Catholic priest [[Krunoslav Draganović]] also helped organize the [[ratlines (history)|ratline]] <ref name=PaginaUki> [http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-14198-2002-12-15.html La Odessa que creó Perón], ''[[Pagina/12]]'', 15 December 2002 {{es icon}} </ref>. According to Goñi, 1948 was the most active year, during which [[Carlos Fuldner]] was in Switzerland with a special passport describing him as "special envoy of the President of Argentina." In 1946, Cardinal [[Antonio Caggiano]] went to the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]], in the name of the Argentine government, offered refuge for French collaborationists who had fled to Rome <ref name=PaginaUki/>.

[[Image:Peron y Eva - casamiento civil - 1945.jpg|thumb|right|The Perons in 1945]]An investigation of 22,000 documents by the [[DAIA]] in 1997 discovered that the network was managed by [[Rodolfo Freude]] who had an office in the Casa Rosada and was close to Eva Perón's brother, [[Juan Duarte]]. According to Ronald Newton, [[Ludwig Freude]], Rudolfo's father, was probably the local representative of the Office Three secret service headed by [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], with probably more influence than the German ambassador [[Edmund von Thermann]]. He had met Perón in the 1930s, and had contacts with Generals [[Juan Pistarini]], [[Domingo Martínez]] and [[José Domingo Molina Gómez|Molina]]. Ludwig Freude's house became the meetingplace for Nazis and Argentine military officers supporting the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]]. In 1943, he went with Perón to Europe to attempt an arms deal with Germany. <ref> [http://www.lanacion.com.ar/202464 La rama nazi de Perón], ''[[La Nacion]]'', 16 February 1997 {{es icon}} </ref>

Examples of Nazis and collaborators who went to Argentina include Emile Dewoitine, who arrived in May 1946 and worked on the [[Pulqui]] jet, [[Erich Priebke]], who arrived in 1947, [[Josef Mengele]] in 1949, [[Adolf Eichmann]] in 1950, his adjutant [[Franz Stangl]], Austrian representative of [[Spitzy]] in Spain, [[Reinhard Spitzy]], [[Charles Lescat]], editor of ''[[Je Suis Partout]]'' in [[Vichy France]], SS functionary [[Ludwig Lienhardt]], German industrialist [[Ludwig Freude]], ''SS-Hauptsturmführer''[[Klaus Barbie]].  As well, many members of the notorious Croatian [[Ustaše]] took refuge in Argentina, as did [[Milan Stojadinovich]], Prime minister of occupied Yugoslavia <ref name=Time> [[Mark Falcoff]], [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/1998/int/981109/latin_america.perons_na30a.html Perón's Nazi Ties], ''[[Time]]'', [[November 9]], [[1998]], vol 152, n°19 </ref>. As in the United States ([[Operation Paperclip]]), Argentina also welcomed displaced German technicians such as [[Kurt Tank]] and [[Ronald Richter]]. Some of these refugees took important roles in Perón's Argentina, such as French collaborationist [[Jacques de Mahieu]], who became an ideologue of the Peronist movement, before becoming mentor to a Roman Catholic nationalist youth group in the 1960s. Belgian collaborationist [[Pierre Daye]] became editor of a Peronist magazine. [[Rodolfo Freude]], Ludwig's son, became Perón's chief of presidential intelligence in his first term. Stojadinovitch founded ''[[El Economista]]'' in 1951, which still carries his name on its masthead. The Croatian priest [[Krunoslav Draganović]], organizer of the San Girolamo ratline, was authorized by Perón to help Nazis come to Argentina, including [[Ante Pavelic]] <ref name=Time/>.

Recently, [[Uki Goñi]]'s research, drawing on investigations in Argentine, Swiss, American, [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Belgian]] government archives, as well as numerous interviews and other sources, was detailed in ''The Real [[ODESSA|Odessa]]: Smuggling the Nazis to Perón's Argentina'' (2002), showing how escape routes known as [[ratlines (history)|ratlines]] were used by [[ex-Nazi|former NSDAP members]] and like-minded people to escape trial and judgment. <ref>[[Uki Goñi]], ''The Real [[ODESSA|Odessa]]: Smuggling the Nazis to Perón's Argentina'' (2002) (Granta Books, 2002, ISBN 1862075816) </ref>  Uki Goñi places particular emphasis on the part played by Perón's government in organizing the ratlines, as well as documenting the aid of Swiss and Vatican authorities in their flight. The Argentine consulate in [[Barcelona]] gave false passports to fleeing Nazi war criminals and collaborationists.

==Juan Perón and the Jewish and German communities of Argentina==

{{cquote|''When I realized that Perón, contrary to previous governments, gave Jewish citizens access to public office, I began to change my way of thinking about Argentine politics...''

Fraser and Navarro write that Juan Perón was a complicated man who over the years stood for many different, often contradictory, things. <ref>Fraser, Nicholas. Navarro, Marysa.

Peron and the Enigmas of Argentina. W.W. Norton and Company. 1987: 221. ISBN 0-393-30543-0</ref>

[[Image:Evita y Golda Meir.jpg|thumb|left|[[Golda Meir]] talks with [[Evita Perón]] on Meir's visit to Argentina, 1951]]Besides Ber Gelbard, Perón sought out the Jewish community for participation in his government. The powerful Secretary of Media, [[Raúl Apold]], was also Jewish, ironically called "Perón´s Goebbels." He favoured the creation of institutions like New Sion (Nueva Sión), the Argentine-Jewish Institute of Culture and Information, presided by Simón Mirelman, and the Argentine-Israeli Chamber of Commerce. Also, he named Rabbi Amran Blum the first Jewish professor of philosophy in the National University of Buenos Aires. After being the first Latin American government to acknowledge the State of Israel, he sent a Jewish ambassador, [[Pablo Mangel]]. Education and Diplomacy were the two strongholds of Catholic nationalism, and both appointments were highly symbolic. The same goes for the 1946 decision of allowing Jewish privates to celebrate their holidays, which was aimed at fostering the Jewish position in another traditionally Catholic institution, the army.
Argentina signed a generous commercial agreement with the Jewish state, that granted favourable terms for Israeli acquisitions of Argentine commodities, and also the [[Eva Perón Foundation]] sent a huge humanitarian aid. [[Chaim Weizmann]] and [[Golda Meir]] expressed their gratitude during their visit to Buenos Aires in 1951.

The [[German Argentine]] community in Argentina is the third largest ethnic group in the country, after the [[Spanish settlement in Argentina|Spanish Argentines]] and the [[Italian settlement in Argentina|Italian Argentines]]. The German Argentine community predates Juan Perón's presidency, going back as far as the time of the [[unification of Germany]]. Laurence Levine writes that Perón found German civilization too "rigid" and therefore had a "distaste" for it. <ref>''Inside Argentina from Perón to Menem: 1950–2000 From an American Point of View'' by Laurence Levine, page 23'' ISBN 0964924773</ref> Crassweller writes that while Juan Perón's own personal preference was for [[Hispanic]] culture, with which he felt a [[spiritual]] affinity, Perón was "[[pragmatic]]" in dealing with the diverse populace of Argentina. <ref>Crassweller, David. Peron and the Enigmas of Argentina. W.W. Norton and Company. 1987: 221. ISBN 0-393-30543-0</ref> 

While Juan Perón's Argentina allowed many Nazi criminals to take refuge in Argentina, Juan Perón's Argentina also accepted more Jewish immigrants than any other country in Latin America, which in part accounts for the fact that Argentina to this day has a population of over 200,000 Jewish citizens, the largest in Latin America, the third largest in the [[Americas]], and the sixth largest in the world. <ref>"Continuing Efforts to Conceal Anti-Semitic Past."

Martínez also notes that Juan Perón's wife, Eva Perón, played no part in allowing Nazis into the country. <ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/1997/int/970120/cinema.the_woman.html THE WOMAN BEHIND THE FANTASY: PROSTITUTE, FASCIST, PROFLIGATE--EVA PERON WAS MUCH MALIGNED, MOSTLY UNFAIRLY] [[Tomás Eloy Martínez]], Director of the Latin American program at Rutgers University</ref>

==The second term (1952-1955)==

Perón was re-elected in 1951.  During his second term, Perón's administration faced serious economic problems.  Perón called employers and unions to a Productivity Congress to regulate social conflict through dialogue, but the congress failed and a deal was not made.

Perón signed a contract with an American oil company, [[Standard Oil of California]], in May 1955, starting a policy of economic development with the help of foreign investment.  The radical party leader, [[Arturo Frondizi]], considered it to be an anti-patriotic decision, but three years later he himself signed contracts with foreign oil companies.

During the second term, several terrorist acts were committed against civilian targets.  On [[April 15]], [[1953]], a terrorist group detonated two bombs in a public rally at [[Plaza de Mayo]], killing 7 and injuring 95.  On [[June 15]], [[1955]], a failed coup d'état by anti-Peronists used navy aircraft to bomb Peronists at [[Plaza de Mayo]], killing 364.  This is considered a prelude to the [[dirty war]] in Argentina between 1976 and 1983.

In 1954, the [[Roman Catholic Church]], which had supported Perón's government, confronted Perón's enactment of the divorce law, among other reasons. Following the expulsion of two Catholic priests, Perón was excommunicated by the [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1955.  On [[September 16]], [[1955]], a nationalist Catholic group from both the Army and Navy, led by General [[Eduardo Lonardi]], General [[Pedro Eugenio Aramburu|Pedro E. Aramburu]] and Admiral [[Isaac Rojas]], took power in a coup which they named ''[[Revolución Libertadora]]'' (the "Liberating Revolution").  The military regime accused Peronist leaders of corruption, but no one was prosecuted.

==Exile (1955-1973)==

[[Image:Parag.871.Stroessner,Peron.jpeg|right|thumb|Presidents Stroessner and Perón. The stamp is Scott Paraguay no. 871]]

After the coup, Perón escaped to [[Paraguay]] with the help of his friend President [[Alfredo Stroessner]] of Paraguay, who sent a gunboat to anchor  in the [[Río de la Plata|Rio de la Plata]].  Later, he lived in [[Panama]], where he met the nightclub singer [[Isabel Martínez de Perón|María Estela Martínez]].  Eventually settling in [[Madrid, Spain]] under the protection of [[Francisco Franco]], he married Isabel in 1961.  In Argentina, Peronism was banned and Peronists were persecuted.  In 1963, the Aramburu decree made even the simple naming of Juan Perón illegal.

In Argentina, the 1950s and 1960s were marked by frequent [[coups d'état]], low economic growth in the 1950s and high growth rates in the 1960s (Gerchunoff et al, 309-321).  Argentina faced problems of continued social and labor demands.  During those years poverty decreased, with rates <!-- of what? such statistics are to be taken carefully. What is "poverty"? what's the threshold? --> between 2% and 5% {{Fact|date=February 2007}} in the first years of the 1960s ([[INDEC]]).  Argentine painter [[Antonio Berni]]'s works reflected the social tragedies of these times.  In particular, Berni dealt with hardship in the ''[[villas miseria]]'' (shanty towns) through his series Juanito Laguna, a slum child, and Ramona Montiel, a prostitute.

Perón was admitted back into the church in [[1963]]. Perón sent his wife, [[Isabel Martínez de Perón|Isabel]], to Argentina in 1965, to meet political dissidents there.  She organized a meeting in the house of mayor Bernardo Alberte, Perón's delegate and sponsor of various left-wing Peronist movements such as the [[General Confederation of Labour (Argentina)|CGT de los Argentinos]].  Between 1968 and 1972, the CGT organized opponents to [[Juan Carlos Onganía]]'s dictatorship, and would have an important role in the 1969 ''[[Cordobazo]]'' insurrection.  During Isabel's visit, [[José López Rega]], future founder of the [[Anticommunist Argentine Alliance|Triple A]] death squad, won Isabel's trust, and then went to Spain see Perón. There, he worked for Perón's security before becoming the couple's personal secretary.

[[Image:Perón y Stroessner.jpg|thumb|left|Peron and Stroessner in 1954]]Perón supported the more active unions and maintained close links with the [[Montoneros]], a left-wing Catholic Peronist group.  On [[June 1]], [[1970]], the Montoneros kidnapped and assassinated former anti-Peronist president [[Pedro Eugenio Aramburu]] in retaliation for the June 1956 Leon Suarez massacre and the execution of [[Juan José Valle]], who had headed a Peronist uprising against the junta.

General [[Alejandro Lanusse]] took power in March 1971 and, faced with strong opposition and social conflicts, declared his intention to restore constitutional democracy by 1973.  From exile, Perón supported both left-wing Peronists and right-wing Peronists. He supported conservative radicals such as [[Ricardo Balbín]], member of the [[Radical Civic Union]] and an old opponent of Perón's. He also supported the left-wing Peronist [[Héctor José Cámpora]], who also became his "personal secretary." In 1971, he sent two letters to the film director [[Octavio Getino]], one congratulating him for his work with [[Fernando Solanas]] and [[Gerardo Vallejo (film-maker)|Gerardo Vallejo]], in the ''[[Grupo Cine Liberación]]'', and another concerning two [[film documentaries]], ''La Revolución Justicialista'' and ''Actualización política y doctrinaria'' <ref name=Tercer> Oscar Ranzani, [http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/cultura/7-42538-2004-10-20.html La revolución es un sueño eterno], ''[[Pagina 12]]'', [[20 October]] [[2004]] {{es icon}}</ref>. 

Finally, members of the right-wing [[Tacuara Nationalist Movement]], considered the first Argentine guerrilla group, turned towards him.  Founded in the early 1960s, the Tacuaras were a fascist, anti-Semitic and anti-conformist group founded on the model of [[José Antonio Primo de Rivera|Primo de Rivera]]'s [[Falange]], who first strongly opposed Peronism.  However, they split after the 1959 [[Cuban Revolution]] into three groups.  Opposed to the Peronist alliance, the Catholic priest Meinvielle retained the original hard-line stance.  [[Dardo Cabo]] founded the [[Movimiento Nueva Argentina]] (MNA, New Argentina Movement), officially launched on June 9, 1961, to commemorate General [[Juan José Valle]]’s Peronist uprising in 1956.  The MNA became the ancestor of all modern Catholic nationalist groups in Argentina.  Finally, [[Joe Baxter]] and [[José Luis Nell]] joined the Peronists, believing in its revolutionary capacities.  They created the [[Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario Tacuara]] (MNRT, Revolutionary Nationalist Tacuara Movement) which, without forsaking nationalism, broke from the Church, and abandoned anti-Semitism.  Baxter’s MNRT became progressively Marxist.  Many of the [[Montoneros]] and of the [[People's Revolutionary Army (Argentina)|ERP]]’s leaders came from this group.

==The third term (1973-1974)==

General elections were held on [[March 11]], [[1973]].  Perón was banned from running, but a stand-in, [[Héctor Cámpora]], a left-wing Peronist and his personal secretary, was elected and took office on [[May 25]].  On [[June 20]], [[1973]], Perón returned from Spain to end his 18-year exile. According to ''[[Pagina 12]]'' newspaper, [[Licio Gelli]], headmaster of [[Propaganda Due]], had provided an [[Alitalia]] plane to return to his native country <ref name=P12> Susana Viau and Eduardo Tagliaferro, [http://www.pagina12.com.ar/1998/98-12/98-12-14/pag03.htm Carlos Bartffeld, Mason y Amigo de Massera, Fue Embajador en Yugoslavia Cuando Se Vendieron Armas a Croacia - En el mismo barco], ''[[Pagina 12]]'', [[December 14]], [[1998]] {{es icon}}</ref>. Gelli was part of a committee supporting Perón, along with [[Carlos Saúl Menem]] (future President of Argentina in the 1980s-90s) <ref name=P12/>. The former Italian Premier [[Giulio Andreotti]] recalled an encounter between Perón, his wife Isabel Martínez and Gelli, saying that Perón knelt before Licio Gelli to salute him <ref name=P12/>.

[[Image:Peron 1974.jpg|thumb|right|Peron in 1974]]On the day of Perón's return, a crowd of left-wing Peronists (estimated at 3.5 million) gathered at the Ezeiza airport in Buenos Aires to welcome him.  Perón was accompanied by Cámpora, whose first measures were to grant [[amnesty]] to all [[political prisoner]]s and reestablish relations with Cuba, helping [[Fidel Castro|Castro]] break the [[United States embargo against Cuba|US embargo]].  This, along with his social policies, had earned him the opposition of right-wing Peronists, including the trade-unionist bureaucracy.

Camouflaged snipers, including members of the [[Argentine Anti-Communist Alliance]] (aka Triple A), opened fire on the crowd at the airport.  The left-wing Peronist Youth Organization and the [[Montoneros]] had been trapped.  At least 13 people were killed and 365 injured in this episode, which became known as the [[1973 Ezeiza massacre|Ezeiza massacre]].<ref>{{es icon}} [[Horacio Verbitsky]], ''Ezeiza'', Contrapunto, Buenos Aires, 1985. Available at [http://www.elortiba.org/ezeiza.html ElOrtiba].</ref>

Cámpora resigned in July 1973, paving the way for new elections, this time with Perón's participation.  Argentina had reached a peak of instability, and Perón was viewed by many as the country's only hope for prosperity and safety. 

UCR leader [[Ricardo Balbín]] and Perón contemplated a Peronist-Radical joint government, but opposition in both parties made this impossible.  Perón received 62% of the vote, returning him to the presidency.  In October 1973 he began his third term, with Isabel, his wife, as Vice President.

Perón's third term was marked by an escalating conflict between the Peronist left- and right-wing factions.  This turmoil was fueled primarily by Perón's growing ties to conservative Radical Party leader Ricardo Balbín, who the opposition, led by [[Raúl Alfonsín]], considered a right-wing radical.  The Montoneros became marginalized in the Peronist movement and were mocked by Perón himself after the Ezeiza massacre. In his speech to the governors on 2 August 1973, Perón openly criticized radical Argentine youth for a lack of political maturity. Shortly after Perón's attack on left-wing Peronism, the Montoneros went underground.  Another guerrilla group, the Guevarists [[ERP]], also opposed the right-wing Peronists, and started engaging in [[armed struggle]], attempting to create a ''[[foco]]'' in [[Tucuman]], the smallest province of Argentina located in the Northwest.  Meanwhile, [[José Lopez Rega]], personal secretary of Juan Perón and then of Isabel Perón, began targeting left-wing opponents.

Perón died of a heart attack on [[July 1]], [[1974]] recommending that his wife, Isabel, rely on Balbín for support.  At the president's burial Balbín uttered a historic phrase, "This old adversary bids farewell to a friend".

Isabel Perón succeeded her husband to the presidency, but proved incapable of managing the country's political and economic problems, including the left-wing insurgency and the reactions of the extreme right.  Ignoring her late husband's advice, Isabel gave Balbín no role in her new government, instead granting broad powers to López Rega, who started a "[[dirty war]]" against political opponents.

[[Image:Juan Domingo Perón 1.jpg|thumb|right|Peron statue in [[Rosario, Santa Fe]], [[Argentina]], 2006]]Isabel Perón's term ended abruptly on [[March 24]], [[1976]] by a military coup d'état.  A [[military junta]], headed by [[Jorge Rafael Videla]] took control of the country, starting the self-styled [[National Reorganization Process]].  The junta combined widespread persecution of political dissidents with [[state terrorism]].  The death toll rose to thousands (at least 9,000, with human rights organizations claiming it was closer to 30,000).  Many of these were "the [[forced disappearance|disappeared]]" (''desaparecidos''), people kidnapped and executed without trial or record.

==Perón's corpse==
Perón was buried in [[La Chacarita Cemetery]] in [[Buenos Aires]].  In 1987, his tomb was desecrated, and his hands and some personal effects, such as his sword, were stolen.{{Fact|date=March 2008}} In the year 2007, journalist David Cox and Damian Nabot in their book La Segunda Muerte reported that the robbery of his hands was connected to [[Licio Gelli]], and military officers that were involved during Argentina's Dirty War.

On [[17 October]] [[2006]] his body was moved to a mausoleum at his former summer residence, rebuilt as a museum, in the Buenos Aires suburb of [[San Vicente, Buenos Aires|San Vicente]].  A few people were injured in riots, as Peronist trade unions fought over access to the ceremony.  The police contained the violence enough for the procession to move to the mausoleum.  This move of Perón's body offered his self-proclaimed illegitimate daughter the opportunity to obtain a DNA sample from his corpse. The woman, Martha Holgado, 72, had been trying for 15 years to do this DNA analysis, which, in [[November 2006]], proved she was not his daughter.<ref>CNN. 17 October 2006.
