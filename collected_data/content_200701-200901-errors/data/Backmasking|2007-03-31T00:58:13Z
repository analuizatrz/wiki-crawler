'''Backmasking''' (also incorrectly known as '''[[backward masking]]''' or '''backwards masking'''<ref>Backward(s) masking has two other meanings; see [[backward masking]]. See also {{cite web |last=Crispen |first=Bob |title=Backward Masking... another pious fraud |url=http://www.crispen.org/rants/backward.html |accessdate=2006-09-01}}</ref>) is a [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] technique in which a message is recorded backwards onto a track that is meant to be played forwards. Backmasking is a deliberate process, whereas a ''backward message'' may be unintentional. Backmasking has been a source of much controversy, especially related to supposed [[subliminal message]]s in rock music.

== History ==
=== Development of backmasking ===
In 1877, the [[phonograph|gramophone]] was invented, allowing recorded music to be played back.<ref name="loop">{{cite web |last=Peters |first=Michael |title=The Birth of Loop: A Short History of Looping Music |url=http://www.loopers-delight.com/history/Loophist.html |accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref> In addition to playing [[gramophone record]]s forwards, one could create new sounds by placing the [[stylus|needle]] on the record and spinning it counter-clockwise.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kittler |first=Friedrick |title=The Gramaphone |work=Adventures in CyberSound |publisher=[[Australian Centre for the Moving Image]] |url=http://www.acmi.net.au/AIC/PHONO_KITTLER.html |accessdate=2007-03-01}}</ref>

[[Image:Reel-to-reel_recorder_tc-630.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Tape recorder]]s allowed backwards recording in [[recording studio]]s.]]

The [[1950s]] saw the development of ''[[musique concrète]]'', an [[avant-garde]] form of [[electronic music]] which involves [[audio editing|editing]] together fragments of natural and industrial sounds, and the spread of the use of [[tape recorder]]s in [[recording studio]]s.<ref>{{cite web |last=White |first=Ray |title=Musique Concrète |url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/whitefiles/b2_h/4_radiophonic_workshop/rws/pgs/rx01.htm |accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref> These two trends led to tape music compositions, which are composed on [[magnetic tape|tape]] using techniques including [[reverse tape effects]].<ref name="loop" />

[[Johnny Cash]]'s first number one hit, "[[I Walk The Line]]" (1956), was derived from a melody that resulted from an accidental tape reversal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stevenmenke.com/I%20Walk%20The%20Line%20Page.htm |title=Johnny Cash - I Walk The Line at Steve Menke.com accessdate=2007-03-30 |last=Menke |first=Steve}}</ref> The actual studio track, however, does not contain any backwards recording.

The first known instance of backwards recording is in "[[They're Coming to Take Me Away Ha-Haaa!]]", a 1966 [[novelty song]] by [[Napoleon XIV]]. The [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of the release is a reversed version of the complete forwards version.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://homepage.mac.com/bavala/reverse.htm |title=Reverse Speech: A Short Introduction |accessdate=2007-03-10 |last=van den Bos |first=Willem |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060207055856/http://homepage.mac.com/bavala/reverse.htm |archivedate=2006-02-27}}</ref>

=== Backmasking rumors ===
The Beatles were involved in the spread of backmasking both as a recording technique and as a controversy. The latter began in the autumn of 1969, when [[WNIC|WKNR-FM]] DJ [[Russell Gibb]] received a phone call from a student at [[Eastern Michigan University]] who identified himself as "Tom". The caller asked Gibb about a rumor that Beatle [[Paul McCartney]] had died, and claimed that the Beatles song "[[Revolution 9]]" contained a backward message confirming the rumor. Gibb played the song backwards on his turntable, and heard "Turn me on, dead man... turn me on, dead man... turn me on, dead man..."<ref>{{cite book |last=Reeve |first=Andru J |title=Turn Me On, Dead Man: The Beatles And The "Paul-Is-Dead" Hoax |pages=11-13 |publisher=[[AuthorHouse]] |url=http://www.authorhouse.com/BookStore/ItemDetail~bookid~25150.aspx |accessdate=2007-03-12}}</ref> Gibb then found various other [[clues]], and began telling his listeners about what he called "The Great Cover-up".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Yoakum |first=Jim |title=The Man Who Killed Paul McCartney |journal=[[Gadfly Online|The Gadfly]] |date=May/June 2000 |url=http://www.gadflyonline.com/archive/MayJune00/archive-mccartney.html |accessdate=2007-10-12}}</ref> This incident popularized both the "[[Paul is dead]]" [[urban legend]] and the idea of backmasking in [[popular music]].

Following Gibb's show, many more instances of alleged hidden backwards messages were found (see [[#Alleged backmasking|alleged backmasking]]). Initially, the search was done mostly by fans of [[rock music]], but in the late 1970s and early 1980s, during the rise of the [[Christian right]],<ref name="nyt">{{cite web |last=Holden |first=Stephen |title=Serious Issues Underlie a New Album from Styx |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=[[1983-03-27]] |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9506E5DF1339F934A15750C0A965948260 |accessdate=2007-03-13}}</ref> some [[fundamentalist Christian]] groups began to claim that backmasked messages could bypass the conscious mind and reach the [[subconscious]], where they would be unknowingly accepted by the listener (see [[#Subliminal persuasion|subliminal persuasion]]).<ref name="poundstone86">{{cite book |last=Poundstone |first=William |authorlink=William Poundstone |title=[[Big Secrets|Bigger Secrets]] |year=1986 |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]] |id=ISBN 0395453976 |chapter=Backward Messages on Records |chapterurl=http://www.skepticfiles.org/mys1/backmsk2.htm |accessdate=2006-08-19}}</ref> In 1982, thirty North Carolina teenagers, led by their pastor, claimed that some singers had been possessed by Satan, who used their voices to create backwards messages, and held a record-burning at their church.<ref name="robinson" /> The [[Parents Music Resource Center]] also advocated against supposed subliminal backmasking,<ref name="ev2">{{cite journal |last=Olcott |first=Ev |title=Backwards Messages|journal=Music And Technology |publisher=First Avenue |url=http://www.triplo.com/ev/column/04.html |accessdate=2007-03-13}}</ref> and accused bands including [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[Queen (band)|Queen]] of using backmasking to promote Satanism and drug use.<ref>{{cite web |last=Wachter |first=Kristi |title=Ridiculous claims from the PMRC |publisher=[[TOTSE]] |url=http://www.totse.com/en/ego/can_you_dance_to_it/pmrcsuks.html |accessdate=2007-03-13}}</ref>

The furor led to legislation by the state governments of Arkansas and California, and calls for investigations in the legislatures of Texas and Canada. The 1983 California bill made the distribution of records with undeclared backmasking an invasion of privacy for which the distributor could be sued. The Arkansas law, passed unanimously in 1983, referenced albums by [[The Beatles]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Electric Light Orchestra]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], and [[Styx (band)|Styx]],<ref name="nyt" /> and mandated that records with backmasking include a warning sticker: "Warning: This record contains backward masking which may be perceptible at a subliminal level when the record is played forward."<ref name="vokey">{{cite journal |last=Vokey |first=John R. |coauthors=J.

[[Image:CD autolev crop.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The [[compact disc]] made finding backwards messages difficult, causing interest in backmasking to decline.]]

With the advent of [[compact disc]]s in the [[1980s]], it became more difficult to listen to recordings backwards, and the controversy died down; however, websites that play songs backward have led to a recent resurgence in interest.<ref name="wsj">{{cite news |last=Searcey |first=Dionne |title=Behind the Music: Sleuths Seek Messages In Lyrical Backspin |publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=[[2006-01-09]] |url=http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB113677367081541303-lMyQjAxMDE2MzA2OTcwNzkzWj.html |accessdate=2007-02-28}}</ref>

Following the release of their 1974 album ''[[Eldorado, A Symphony|Eldorado]]'', [[Electric Light Orchestra]] was accused of hiding a backwards Satanic message in the track "[[Eldorado (song)|Eldorado]]": "He is the nasty one / Christ, you're infernal / It is said we're dead men / Everyone who has the mark will live."<ref name="poundstone83" /> ELO singer and songwriter [[Jeff Lynne]] responded by calling this accusation (and the related charge of being "devil-worshippers") "skcolloB".<ref name="ftm">{{cite web |title=Electric Light Orchestra Biogs |publisher=Face The Music |url=http://www.ftmusic.com/biogs/elo/elo_biog.html |accessdate=2007-03-14}}</ref> In addition, the group later included several deliberate backmasked messages in their other albums (see [[#Parody messages|parody messages]]).

In 1981, [[Styx (band)|Styx]] was accused of putting the backwards message "Satan move through our voices" on the song "Snowblind", from ''[[Paradise Theatre]]''.<ref name="nyt" /> Songwriter [[Dennis DeYoung]] called these charges "rubbish",<ref name="arar">{{cite news |last=Arar |first=Yardena |title=Satanic records or balderdash: Just what the devil's going on? |publisher=[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|The Daily Herald]] |date=[[1982-05-26]] |url=http://www.lashtal.com/nuke/module-subjects-viewpage-pageid-79.phtml |accessdate=2007-04-15}}</ref> and responded, "If we want to make a statement, we'll do it in a way that people can understand us and not in a way where you have to go out and buy a $400 tape player to understand us."<ref name="kilroy">{{cite news |last=Hoekstra |first=Dave |title=Styx makes a statement |publisher=Suburban Sun-Times |date=[[1983-04-01]] |url=http://www.racerrecords.com/Styx/statement.html |accessdate=2007-03-14}}</ref> In 1983, the band released a concept album satirizing the [[Moral Majority]] (see [[#Parody messages|parody messages]]).

=== Subliminal persuasion ===
{{further|[[Subliminal message]]}}

Various [[fundamentalist Christian]] groups have claimed that Satan uses backmasked messages to alter behavior. [[Gary Greenwald]], a fundamentalist Christian preacher, claims that backmasked messages can be heard subliminally, and can induce listeners towards, in the case of rock music, sex and drug use.<ref name="sketches">{{cite book |title=Psychological Sketches |editors=John R.

In 1990, British [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Judas Priest]] was sued over a [[suicide pact]] made by two [[Nevada]] schoolboys. The lawsuit by their families claimed that the 1978 Judas Priest album ''[[Stained Class]]'' contained hidden messages, including the words "Do it", allegedly audible when the song "Better By You, Better Than Me" was played backwards. The case was dismissed, and the judge's ruling stated that "The scientific research presented does not establish that subliminal stimuli, even if perceived, may precipitate conduct of this magnitude. There exist other factors which explain the conduct of the deceased independent of the subliminal stimuli." Judas Priest members also commented that if they wanted to insert subliminal commands in their music, killing their fans would be counterproductive, and they would prefer to insert the command "Buy more of our records."<ref>Van Taylor, David.

=== Skepticism ===
In 1985, university psychologists John R. Vokey and J. Don Read conducted a study using [[Psalm 23]] from the [[Bible]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s "[[Another One Bites the Dust]]," and various other sound passages made up for the experiment. Vokey and Read concluded that if backmasking did indeed exist, it was ineffective. Their volunteers had trouble even noticing the backmasked phrase when the tape was played forward, were unable to judge the type of message (whether it was Christian, Satanic, or commercial) it contained, and were not led to behave in any certain way as a result of being "exposed" to the backmasked phrase.<ref name="sketches" /> Due to this research, Vokey and Read were later called upon as expert witnesses in the aforementioned trial involving the band Judas Priest.

Audio engineer [[Ev Olcott]] claims that messages by artists including Queen and Led Zeppelin are coincidental phonetic reversals, in which the spoken or sung [[phoneme]]s form new combinations of words when listened to backwards.<ref name="ev" /> Olcott states that "Actually engineering or planning a phonetic reversal is next to impossible, and even more difficult when trying to design it with words that fit into a song."<ref name="ev2" />

[[Michael Shermer]] claims that the emergence of the [[Paul is dead]] phenomenon, including the alleged message at the end of "I'm So Tired", was caused by faulty perception of a pattern. Shermer argues that the human brain evolved with a strong [[pattern recognition]] ability that was necessary to process the large amount of [[noise]] in man's environment, but that today this ability leads to [[false positive]]s.<ref>{{cite news |last=Shermer |first=Michael |title=Turn Me On, Dead Man |year=2005 |month=May |publisher=[[Scientific American]] |url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000EB977-12BE-1264-8F9683414B7FFE9F |accessdate=2007-02-28}}</ref>

[[Stanford University]] psychology professor Brian Wandell claims that the observance of backward messages is a mistake arising from this pattern recognition facility.

== Deliberate backmasking ==
{{see also|List of backmasked messages}}

Many musicians have deliberately recorded backward messages into their songs. Deliberate backmasked messages are unintelligible noise when played forward, but when played backwards are clear speech.<ref name="robinson" />

=== Satanic references ===
{{POV-section}}
{{OR}}

Although the Satanic backmasking controversy involved mainly [[classic rock]] bands that denied any intent to promote [[satanism]], some backmasking has been used by [[heavy metal music|metal]] bands which have employed Satanism in their lyrics or imagery. Though the members of [[Slayer]] are not Satanists, they have frequently used Satanic imagery, and the start of their 1985 album ''[[Hell Awaits]]'' includes a deep backmasked voice chanting "Join Us" over and over at increasing volumes.<ref>{{cite web |last=Giles |first=Jeff |title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Slayer |date=2007-03-20 |url=http://jefitoblog.com/blog/?p=1118 |accessdate=2007-03-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Did You Know? |publisher=Slayerized |url=http://www.slayerized.com/band/didyouknow.html |accessdate=2006-06-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Greatest Metal Bands Of All Time:Slayer |publisher=[[MTV News]] |url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/m/metal/greatest_metal_bands/071406/index7.jhtml |accessdate=2007-03-21}}</ref> [[Cradle of Filth]], who have also employed Satanic imagery, released the song "Dinner at Deviant's Palace", which consists almost entirely of ambient sounds and a reversed reading of the [[Lord's Prayer]]<ref name="hardrock">{{cite web |last=Corbin |first=Dean |title=Hard Rock/Metal/Punk |publisher=Backmask Online |url=http://www.backmaskonline.com/hardrock.html |accessdate=2006-07-25}}</ref> (backwards readings of the Lord's Prayer are allegedly used in certain Satanic rites<ref>{{cite book |last=Fuller |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Fuller |title=Good Thoughts in Bad Times, and Other Papers |year=1863 |publisher=Ticknor and Fields |url=http://www.books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC05821745 |accessdate=2007-03-21 |page=157 |quote=Witches are reported (amongst many other hellish observations, whereby they oblige themselves to Satan) to say the Lord's prayer backwards.}}</ref>).

=== Statements ===
Backwards messages have also been used to record statements or to avoid censorship. On [[Roger Waters]]' 1991 album ''[[Amused to Death]]'', Waters recorded a backward message critical of film director [[Stanley Kubrick]], who had refused to let Waters sample a breathing sound from ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Simon |first=Michael |title=Amused To Death Trivia |publisher=Roger Waters International Fan Club |url=http://www.rogerwaters.org/atdtrivia.html |accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref> On "Perfect Sense Part 1", Waters' backmasked voice says, "Julia, however, in light and visions of the issues of Stanley, we have changed our minds.

[[Insane Clown Posse]]'s song "Echo Side" from their 1999 album [[The Amazing Jeckel Brothers]] contains the backmasked message, "Fuck the Devil! Fuck that shit! We believe in life legit.

[[Image:Zappa.jpg|thumb|170px|right|[[Frank Zappa]] used backmasking both to avoid censorship and to parody charges by the [[Parents Music Resource Center]].]]

Backmasking was used by [[Frank Zappa]] in his earliest albums to avoid censorship. "Hot Poop", from ''[[We're only in it for the Money]]'' (1968), contains the backmasked message "Better look around before you say you don't care/Shut your f[censored]ing<!-- please don't change this to "fucking" - the song is itself censored --> mouth 'bout the length of my hair/how would you survive/if you were alive/shitty little person?" at the end of side A. This profanity laced verse, originally from the song "Mother People", was censored in the United States release, so Zappa edited the verse out, reversed it, and inserted it elsewhere in the album as a "song" called "Hot Poop." However, even in the backwards message the word "fucking" is censored.<ref>{{cite web |title=We're Only In It for the Money |last=Pacholski |first=Luke |url=http://www.lukpac.org/~handmade/patio/vinylvscds/money.html |accessdate=2006-07-29}}</ref>

=== Parody messages ===
In response to the Satanic backmasking controversy, various artists recorded messages poking fun at the allegations with over-the-top Satanic messages or exaggeratedly wholesome messages.

Zappa released "Ya Hozna", from 1984's [[Them or Us]], in part as a response to the [[Parents Music Resource Center]] controversy, during which he testified at a [[United States Senate|Senate]] hearing regarding "porn rock".<ref>{{cite web |author=SazSquatch |title=Ya Hozna (Frank Zappa): You figure it out |publisher=The [[Easter egg (virtual)|Easter Egg]] Archive |date=[[2003-02-19]] |url=http://www.eeggs.com/items/38394.html |accessdate=2006-08-23}}</ref> The song contains various messages in both German and English, made up of distorted outtakes from "[[Ship Arriving Too Late to Save a Drowning Witch|Valley Girl]]", "[[We're Only in It for the Money|Lonely Little Girl]]", and "[[One Size Fits All|Sofa #2]]".<ref>{{cite web |author=Chris-O |title=Ya Hozna |publisher=[[Everything2]] |url=http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1029203 |accessdate=2006-08-23}}</ref>

Following accusations of Satanic backmasking in their 1974 album ''[[Eldorado, A Symphony|Eldorado]]'' (see [[#Alleged backmasking|alleged backmasking]]), [[Electric Light Orchestra]] included deliberate backmasking in two songs on their next album, 1975's ''[[Face the Music (album)|Face The Music]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Michel |first=Rob |title=1974: Electric Light Orchestra: Eldorado |work=Counting Out Time |publisher=Dutch Progressive Rock Page |year=2002 |month=August |url=http://www.dprp.net/proghistory/index.php?i=1974_03 |accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref> "[[Down Home Town]]" contains a voice which repeats twice, in reverse, "Pass the mighty waterfall".<ref name="elo">{{cite web |title=Secret Messages |work=My Electric Light Orchestra Fan Site |publisher=FutureBright |url=http://elo.futurebright.com/Secrets.htm |accessdate=2006-07-27}}</ref> And the instrumental "[[Fire On High]]" contains the backmasked message "The music is reversible, but time is not, turn back! Turn back! Turn back!" ({{audio|Elofireonhighreverce.ogg|listen}}<!-- FAIR USE of Image:Elofireonhighreverce.ogg: see image description pages at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Elofireonhighreverce.ogg for rationale -->). Later, in 1983, ELO released an entire album, ''[[Secret Messages]]'', in response to the backmasking controversy.<ref name="ftm" /> Among the many backmasked messages on the album are "Welcome to the big show" (2x),<ref name="poundstone86" /> "Thank you for listening", "Look out there's danger ahead", "Hup two three four", "Time After Time", and "you're playing me backwards".<ref name="elo" />

[[Image:USA Great Seal Reverse.png|thumb|130px|left|[[Styx (band)|Styx]], after being accused of Satanic backmasking, included an actual backmasked message in ''[[Kilroy Was Here (album)|Kilroy Was Here]]'': "''[[Annuit Cœptis]], [[Novus Ordo Seclorum]]''".]]

[[Styx (band)|Styx]] also released an album in response to allegations of Satanic backmasking (see [[#Alleged backmasking|alleged backmasking]]).<ref name="kilroy" /> The album, 1983's ''[[Kilroy Was Here (album)|Kilroy Was Here]]'', deals with an allegorical group called the "Majority for Musical Morality" that outlaws rock music.<ref name="nyt" /> A sticker on the album cover contains the message, "By order of the Majority for Musical Morality, this album contains secret backward messages". One song, "Heavy Metal Poisoning", does in fact contain the backmasked [[Latin language|Latin]] words "''[[Annuit Cœptis]], [[Novus Ordo Seclorum]]''" ("God has favored our undertakings; a new order for the ages") — part of the [[Great Seal of the United States|Great Seal]] which encircles the pyramid on the back of the [[United States one-dollar bill|dollar bill]].<ref name="poundstone86" />

The [[Christian rock]] group [[Petra (band)|Petra]] included in their song "Judas Kiss" a message in response to the backmasking controversy: "What are you looking for the devil for, when you ought to be looking for the Lord?"<ref name="poundstone86" />

[[Image:Sox Satanic Subliminals.png|thumb|right|200px|The manual for the popular sound program [[SoX]] pokes fun at subliminal messages. The description of the "reverse" option says "Included for finding satanic subliminals."]]

The [[electro (music)|electro]] band [[Mindless Self Indulgence]]'s 2000 album ''[[Frankenstein Girls Will Seem Strangely Sexy]]'' contains a song named "Backmask (warning!)" that contains the lyrics (when played forwards) "Play that record backwards/ Here's a message yo for the suckas/ Play that record backwards/ And go fuck yourself." When played backwards, clearly audible reversed speech by [[Little Jimmy Urine]] can be heard, including "Respect your parents", "Clean your room", "Do your homework", and "Eat your vegetables".<ref name="modernrock">{{cite web |last=Corbin |first=Dean |title=Modern Rock |publisher=Backmask Online |url=http://www.backmaskonline.com/modernrock.html |accessdate=2006-07-25}}</ref>

Two songs by [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] employ deliberate backmasking; only one song of the two has a particular (albeit [[tongue-in-cheek]]) demonic reference. In "Nature Trail to Hell", from the 1984 album ''[["Weird Al" Yankovic in 3-D]]'', Al declares that "Satan eats [[Cheez Whiz]]". Later, in "[[I Remember Larry]]" from the 1996 album ''[[Bad Hair Day]]'', Al lightly chastises the listener, remarking, "Wow, you must have an awful lot of free time on your hands."<ref>{{cite web |last=Lick |first=Marty "Gumby" |coauthors="Happy Steve" Chai| title="Weird Al" Yankovic Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Al-oholics Anonymous |url=http://www.al-oholicsanonymous.com/faq/index.html |accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref>

[[The Bloodhound Gang]] included a parody message referencing the aforementioned Judas Priest case on "Lift Your Head Up High (And Blow Your Brains Out)", from 1996's ''[[One Fierce Beer Coaster]]''. After the forwards lyrics "I hope you take this the wrong way / And misinterpret what I say / Rewind and let me reverse it / Backwards like Judas Priest first did", a backmasked message is recited in a deep voice: "Devil child will wake up and eat [[Chef Boyardee]] Beefaroni".<ref>{{cite web |author=Hasket |title=One Fierce Beer Coaster: backwards talk decoded |publisher=The [[Easter egg (virtual)|Easter Egg]] Archive |date=[[2001-04-16]] |url=http://www.eeggs.com/items/25047.html |accessdate=2006-07-17}}</ref>

=== Artistic backmasking ===
Various artists have used backmasking for artistic effect. 

[[Pink Floyd]]'s song "[[Empty Spaces]]" has an extended backmasked message: "...congratulations. You've just discovered the secret message. Please send your answer to Old Pink, care of the funny farm, Chalfont."<ref name="milner" /><ref name="ev" /> (voice in background) "Roger! Carolyne is on the phone!"<ref name="urick">{{cite web |title=Empty Spaces |last=Urick |first=Brett |work=A Litarary Analysis of Pink Floyd's The Wall |url=http://www.thewallanalysis.com/emptyspaces.html |accessdate=2007-02-03}}</ref> Many fans believe this line refers to former lead singer [[Syd Barrett]], who suffered a breakdown years earlier.<ref>{{cite web |author=Anonymous |title=Empty Spaces (Pink Floyd): Man Talking Backwards |publisher=The [[Easter egg (virtual)|Easter Egg]] Archive |date=[[1999-08-31]] |url=http://www.eeggs.com/items/1968.html |accessdate=2007-02-03}}</ref> Another interpretation of this is that it foreshadows the progression of Pink (the main character on [[The Wall]]) towards insanity and the "funny farm."<ref name="urick" />

The track "Renholdër", on [[A Perfect Circle]]'s 2000 album ''[[Mer de Noms]]'', includes a high-pitched voice saying "Danny Lohner, Danny Lohner". [[Danny Lohner]] was an early member of A Perfect Circle. The title, "Renholdër," is "Re: D. Lohner" backwards.<ref>{{cite web |title=Renholder by A Perfect Circle |author=Chrissy |publisher=[[Songfacts]] |url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=3191 |accessdate=2007-02-02}}</ref> 

One use of backmasking is to reverse an earlier part of a song. [[Jay Chou]]'s song "You Can Hear" it, from 1993's ''[[Ye Hui Mei]]'', has the backmasked message "Zhi you ni neng ting de dao" ("Only you can hear it"), following the same lyrics forwards.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jay Chou FAQ |publisher=Jay-Chou.net |url=http://www.jay-chou.net/forums/faq.php?faq=new_faq_item2 |accessdate=2006-06-21}}</ref> [[At the Drive-In]]'s song "300 MHz", from the ''[[Vaya]]'' [[EP]], includes various reversed messages from earlier in the song.<ref name="modernrock" /> [[Lacuna Coil]]'s "Self Deception", on the 2002 album ''[[Comalies]]'', contains a reversed version of the chorus of the song: "I don't know what to do, no guilt is in my heart, I don't know what to do, I'm not the reason"<ref>{{cite web |title=Lacuna Coil - Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Emptyspiral.net – The Lacuna Coil Community |date=[[2006-12-10]] |url=http://emptyspiral.net/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=69 |accessdate=2006-08-23}}</ref> And [[Missy Elliott]]'s "Work It", from 2002's ''[[Under Construction]]'', contains the lyrics "I put my thing down, flip it, and reverse it", once forwards and twice backwards.<ref name="rap" />

=== Backwards effects ===
{{see also|Reverse tape effects}}

Though not strictly backmasking, backwards recording of sound effects or instrumental audio is a common technique used by record producers.<ref>{{cite web |last=Federlein |first=David |title=Reader comments: backwards satanic messages |work=The [[Skeptic's Dictionary]] |date=[[2005-04-01]] |url=http://skepdic.com/comments/backcom.html |accessdate=2006-08-26}}</ref>

Backwards effects are often used to [[censorship|censor]] words and phrases deemed as inappropriate on [[radio edit]]s and edited album releases.<ref name="nelson">{{cite web |last=Nelson |first=Chris |title=Sticker Ban Policy: Family Values Or Consumer Fraud? |publisher=[[VH1]] |date=[[1998-09-08]] |url=http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/501064/19980908/story.jhtml |accessdate=2007-02-03}}</ref> [[The Fugees]]' clean version of the album ''[[The Score (album)|The Score]]'' contains various backmasked [[profanity|swears]].<ref name="nelson" /> Thus, when playing the album backwards, the swears are clearly audible among the backwards gibberish.<ref>{{cite web |author=mcc |publisher=[[Everything2]] |title=Music that sounds better backward than forward |url=http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=677630 |accessdate=2006-08-26}}</ref>

Various bands have reversed entire tracks. [[The Stone Roses]] have made heavy use of the technique: their eponymous debut album features a track entitled 'Don't stop' which was a backwards version of the preceding track 'Waterfall' overdubbed with new vocals.<ref>{{cite web |last=Pomroy |first=Matt |title=The Stone Roses: self-titled |date=[[2002-10-22]] |publisher=[[PopMatters]] |url=http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/s/stoneroses-st.shtml |accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref> Three of the bands' other singles, "Elephant Stone", "Made of Stone", and "Where Angels Play", were accompanied by B-sides of the original A-side tracks ("Full Fathom Five", "Guernica", and "Simone") played backwards and overdubbed with new vocals and instrumentation.<ref>{{cite web |author=Paul |title=Full Fathom Five |work=This Is The Daybreak |url=http://www.pdmcauley.co.uk/FFF.htm |accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite interview |last=Brown |first=Ian |interviewer=Adam Walton |date=[[1999-02-02]] |url=http://adamwalton.co.uk/mmt_arc/int-ianbrown.htm |accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref> On heavy rock act [[Korn]]'s track "Am I Going Crazy", from their fourth album, ''[[Issues (album)|Issues]]'', the recorded music is played forward in one channel and backward in the other.<ref>{{cite web |title=Am I Going Crazy? by KoRn |author=Nick |publisher=[[Songfacts]] |url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=2852 |accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref>

Though not true backwards recording, the backwards playing of instruments can be used to create a backwards-sounding recording. Part of the [[David Bowie]] song "Move On" is his earlier song "All The Young Dudes" played backwards. Bowie stated that "I was playing through some old tapes of mine on a Revox and accidentally played one backwards and thought it was beautiful. Without listening to what it was originally we recorded it note for note backwards".<ref>{{cite web |title= Encyclopaedia: A |work=The Ziggy Stardust Companion |url=http://www.5years.com/encya.htm |accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref> [[The Stone Roses]] created the song "Don't Stop" from their [[The Stone Roses (album)|self-titled debut album]] by playing the demo of another song, "Waterfall", backwards, and then adding lyrics that they thought fit to the sound of the song. The 1999 album [[In Reverse]] by [[Matthew Sweet]] included several reversed guitar parts<ref>{{cite web |last=Medina |first=Jay |title=Music Review: In Reverse, Matthew Sweet |date=[[2007-01-14]] |work=Jay's Movie and Music Blog |url=http://moviesandmusic.wordpress.com/tag/music-reviews/ |accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref> which were played directly onto a tape running in reverse.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Simons |first=David |title=Matthew Sweet: Rebuilding the Wall of Sound |journal=[[Guitar Player]] |year=2000 |month=January |url=http://www.matthewsweet.com/news/press2.html |accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref> For live concerts, the guitar parts were played live on stage using a backward emulator.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Simons |first=David |title=Back on the Bus |journal=Onstage |year=2000 |month=January |url=http://www.matthew-sweet.com/inreverseinterview.html#anchor12535 |accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref>

Similarly, the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]] based the audio backing for a science fiction play on reversed voices.<ref>{{cite web |last=Marsh |first=Peter |title=Experimental Review - Radiophonic Workshop |publisher=[[BBC]] |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/release/9xn8/ |accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref> Various instruments played backwards were also used by the Radiophonic Workshop in the creation for the theme song of [[Doctor Who]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Ayres |first=Mark |title=A History of the Doctor Who Theme |work=The Mark Ayres Doctor Who pages |url=http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/Mark_Ayres/DWTheme.htm |accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref>

== Cultural references ==
In the [[Adam Sandler]] movie ''[[Little Nicky (film)|Little Nicky]]'', one character attempts to demonstrate a backwards satanic message on an [[Ozzy Osbourne]] album. At this point, the title character — one of the devil's sons, played by Sandler — says that "the blizzard always came straight with his messages", but produces a [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]] record and reveals that it clearly says, when played backwards: "I command you, in the name of Lucifer, to spill the blood of the innocent".<ref>{{cite web |title=Memorable quotes for Little Nicky |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]] |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0185431/quotes |accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref>
