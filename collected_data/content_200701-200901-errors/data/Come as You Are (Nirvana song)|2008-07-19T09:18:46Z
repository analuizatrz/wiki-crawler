"'''Come as You Are'''" is a song by the [[United States|American]] [[Grunge music|grunge]] band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], written by frontman [[Kurt Cobain]]. It is the third song on (and second [[Single (music)|single]] from) the band's second album ''[[Nevermind]]'' (1991). It was the album's second most successful single, and the band's second American Top 40 hit in 1992.

==Background==
"Come as You Are" was one of the few new songs Nirvana recorded onto a rehearsal tape the group sent to producer [[Butch Vig]] prior to the recording of ''Nevermind'' in 1991.<ref>Azerrad, p. 166-67</ref> The group recorded the song with Vig during album sessions at Sound City Studios in [[Van Nuys]], [[California]], in early 1991. "Come as You Are" was selected as the second single from the album; it was anticipated that the album's first single, "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]", would be a "base-building alternative cut", while "Come as You Are" would be able to cross over into other radio formats. However, "Smells Like Teen Spirit" became a surprise hit and boosted the band's popularity.<ref>Azerrad, p. 227</ref>

After its release as a single in March 1992, "Come as You Are" peaked at number 32 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100; it was the band's second and last American [[Top 40]] hit.<ref name="Billboard singles">[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Singles&model.vnuArtistId=5316&model.vnuAlbumId=810092 Nirvana Artist Chart History: Singles]. Billboard.com. Retrieved on [[June 4]], [[2008]].</ref> The single stayed on the chart for 18 weeks.<ref name="RS CAYA">"[http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6596290/come_as_you_are come As You Are]". ''Rolling Stone''. [[December 9]], [[2004]]. Retrieved on [[June 4]], [[2008]].</ref> The song also reached number three on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream]] and [[Hot Modern Rock Tracks|Modern Rock Tracks]] charts.<ref name="Billboard singles" />

==Lyrics==
The song's prominent line "And I swear that I don't have a gun" has also been interpreted to mean that Cobain "had nothing to hide from anyone." Cobain was known for writing using heavy metaphor in his lyrics, allowing fans to decide what the words meant to them. After the death of the song's author, the media paid much attention to the song's prominent line, and other songs on ''Nevermind'' that mentioned guns, though the album was written and recorded three years before Cobain's death and therefore it was taken as a mere coincidence.

==Music video==
The music video was directed by [[Kevin Kerslake]], who later directed the videos for "[[Lithium (Nirvana song)|Lithium]]," "[[In Bloom]]," and "[[Sliver (song)|Sliver]]." After the unsatisfactory experience filming the "Smells Like Teen Spirit" with [[Samuel Bayer]], Cobain selected Kerslake due to his impressionisic style. Cobain was unable to formulate any ideas beyond homaging the ''Nevermind'' album cover and including "a lot of purples and reds", so he let Kerslake conceptualize the clip.<ref name="azerrad246">Azerrad, p. 246</ref> The band shot outdoor footage in a park in [[Hollywood Hills]] a few days prior to the main video shoot. Kerslake projected this footage in the background of many shots in the main part of the video.<ref>Azerrad, p. 247</ref>

The video features the band in a dark room, where the appearance of falling water in front of the band distorts and blurs the band members' faces (an idea suggested by Cobain).<ref name="azerrad246" /> Throughout the video, clips such as cells multiplying at an incredible rate, to a living organism in its embryotic stages are shown. The video clip also features Kurt Cobain swinging away on a chandelier throughout the room, and water begins to flow into the room. In addition, the video shows parts involving a dog wearing a cone collar. Images of a baby swimming underwater (a reference to the cover of ''Nevermind'') and a gun floating appear. Towards the end, a clip of the band appears, with Cobain in the front, lying on the ground and kissing the camera.

==Killing Joke controversy==
When ''Nevermind'' was released, members of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[post-punk]] band [[Killing Joke]] claimed the main [[guitar riff]] of "Come As You Are" plagiarized the riff of their own single, "Eighties". The band, however, did not file a copyright infringement lawsuit, which according to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' was "due to personal and financial reasons." In some interviews, [[Jaz Coleman]] stated he did not file a lawsuit because the members of Nirvana openly confessed to him that they indeed took the riff, which he said was all he wanted to hear.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzjnXpnKue4 | title=Jaz and Youth Interview (video) | accessdate=2006-09-26}}</ref>

However, conflicting reports state that Killing Joke ''did'' file a lawsuit but that it was thrown out of court,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.anirrationaldomain.net/articles/current/kerrang120403.html | title=Conspiracy of Two | accessdate=2006-09-18}}</ref> or that it was dropped following Cobain's death.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/music/2003/07/24/killing_interview.shtml | title=Interview with Killing Joke's Geordie | accessdate=2006-09-18}}</ref> [[Geordie Walker]], Killing Joke's guitar player, stated that:<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.anirrationaldomain.net/articles/1992-1996/guitarist1294.html | title=December 1994 Guitarist Magazine | accessdate=2006-09-18}}</ref>

<blockquote>"We are very pissed off about that, but it's obvious to everyone. We had two separate musicologists' reports saying it was. Our publisher sent their publisher a letter saying it was and they went 'Boo, never heard of ya!', but the hysterical thing about Nirvana saying they'd never heard of us was that they'd already sent us a Christmas card!"</blockquote>

Nevertheless, apparently neither band held a grudge about this; ex-Nirvana [[drummer]] [[Dave Grohl]] played drums on Killing Joke's [[Killing Joke 2003 (album)|thirteenth (second self-titled) album]] in 2003.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/killingjoke/articles/story/5936629/nirvana_pay_back_killing_joke |title=Nirvana Pay Back Killing Joke - Dave Grohl drums on UK band's first studio album in seven years |accessdate=2007-11-24 |last=Borzillo-Vrenna |first=Carrie |authorlink=Carrie Borzillo-Vrenna |date=2003-04-10 |work=ARTISTS |publisher=RollingStone |quote=Twelve years after Nirvana borrowed heavily from Killing Joke's "Eighties" to create "Come As You Are," the reunited UK band is borrowing the defunct Seattle band's drummer to make its first studio album in seven years. }}</ref>

==Other versions==
An [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic]] version of "Come As You Are," from Nirvana's [[MTV Unplugged]] set on November 18, 1993, appears on the album ''[[MTV Unplugged in New York]].'' The album was released in November 1994. 

A live rendition, recorded on November 25, 1991 at the [[Paradiso (Amsterdam)|Paradiso]] in [[Amsterdam]], appears on the band's 1994 [[home video]], ''[[Live! Tonight! Sold Out!!]]''. It features Cobain screaming the song's lyrics over an out-of-tune guitar. 
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:FenderLegend.jpg|right|150px|The original version of "Come As You Are" appeared on the ''Fender 50th Anniversary Guitar Legends'' album]] -->
The ''Nevermind'' version appears on the compilation album, ''Fender 50th Anniversary Guitar Legends'', released in 1996 to celebrate the [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] guitar company's 50th anniversary. The ''Nevermind'' version also appears on the band's 2002 "best-of" compilation, ''[[Nirvana (album)|Nirvana]]''.

[[Outtake]]s from the "Come As You Are" [[music video]], directed by [[Kevin Kerslake]], appear on the [[DVD]] menu of the band's 2004 [[box set]], ''[[With the Lights Out]]''. 

A [[boombox]]-recorded [[demo (music)|demo]] version appears on the 2005 compilation album, ''[[Sliver - The Best of the Box]]''. It was recorded in March 1991 as part of a demo tape sent to ''Nevermind'' [[record producer|producer]] [[Butch Vig]].

The TV program Cold Case featured the song at the ending scene.

The song's lyrics are vaguely referenced in "[[Adam's Song]]" by California pop-punk band "[[blink-182]]" when it says "I took my time, I hurried up. The choice was mine...."

==Welcome to Aberdeen==
[[Image:Welcome to Aberdeen cropped.jpg|thumb|Tribute to Kurt Cobain in [[Aberdeen, Washington|Aberdeen]]]]
In 2005, a sign was put up in [[Aberdeen, Washington]], Cobain's hometown, that reads "Welcome to Aberdeen - Come As You Are" as a tribute to Cobain. The sign was paid for and created by the Kurt Cobain Memorial Committee, a non-profit organization created in May 2004 to honor Cobain. Founded by author [[Jeff Burlingame]] and Aberdeen City Councilman Paul Fritts, the Committee also plans to create a Kurt Cobain Memorial Park and a youth center in Aberdeen. This may be considered somewhat ironic, as Cobain openly spoke about his hatred for Aberdeen and the friends he had there while growing up.
