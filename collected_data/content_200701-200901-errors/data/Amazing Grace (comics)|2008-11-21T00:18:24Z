After Superman (posing as Clark Kent) was transported to Apokolips Grace was "captured" by Darkseid's troops and was to be thrown into the firepits; all to lure Superman out. He saved her, but he himself fell into the firepits. He survived, but with no memory or powers. It was implied that Grace seduced Superman on behalf of Darkseid, and convinced the Man of Steel that he was Darkseid's son. Superman was given his powers back when he allied himself with Darkseid and led Darkseid's forces into battle. Serving Darkseid, Superman went into battle against Darkseid's true son, Orion, who used the powers of the Motherbox to restore Superman's memories while erasing his knowledge of, and guilt over,  the thousands that had died because of his actions under Grace's influence.

==Powers and abilities==
Like her brother [[Glorious Godfrey]], Grace is a master of mind manipulation, who uses those powers to subtly influence others.
