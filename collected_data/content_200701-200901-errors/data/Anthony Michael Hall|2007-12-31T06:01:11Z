'''Michael Anthony Thomas Charles Hall''' (born [[April 14]], [[1968]]), known professionally as '''Anthony Michael Hall''', is an [[United States|American]] [[actor]], [[film producer|producer]] and [[film director|director]] who achieved stardom in several successful teen-oriented films of the [[1980s]]. Hall began his career in commercials and on stage as a child, and made his screen debut in 1980. His films with director-screenwriter [[John Hughes (film director)|John Hughes]], beginning with the popular [[1984 in film|1984]] [[coming of age|coming-of-age]] comedy ''[[Sixteen Candles]]'', shaped his early career. Hall's next movies with Hughes were the teen classics ''[[The Breakfast Club]]'' and ''[[Weird Science (film)|Weird Science]]'', both in [[1985 in film|1985]]. His performances as lovable [[geek]]s in these three films connected his name and face with the stereotype for an entire generation. 

Hall diversified his roles to avoid becoming [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] as his "geek" persona,  joining the cast of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (1985–1986) and starring in films such as ''[[Out of Bounds (1986 film)|Out Of Bounds]]'' (1986), ''[[Johnny Be Good]]'' (1988), ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' (1990) and ''[[Six Degrees of Separation (film)|Six Degrees of Separation]]'' (1993). After a series of minor roles in the [[1990s]], his performance as [[Microsoft]]’s [[Bill Gates]] in the [[Emmy]]-nominated [[1999 in television|1999]] film ''[[Pirates of Silicon Valley]]'' put him back in the spotlight. He starred role in the popular [[USA Network]] series ''[[The Dead Zone (TV series)|The Dead Zone]]'', from [[2002 in television|2002]] to [[2007 in television|2007]]. During its run, the show remained one of the highest-rated cable television series.<ref name="usanetwork">{{cite web | publisher=September 18, 2006 | title= USA Network announces sixth season pick up of "The Dead Zone" | url=http://www.usanetwork.com/series/thedeadzone/behindthescenes/news/press091806.html | accessmonthday=September 29 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

[[Image:Vacation2.jpg|thumb|250px|Hall in 1983's ''[[National Lampoon's Vacation]]'']]
The following year, Hall landed the role of Rusty Griswold, [[Chevy Chase]] and [[Beverly D'Angelo]]'s son, in ''[[National Lampoon's Vacation]]'', catching the attention of the film's screenwriter [[John Hughes (film director)|John Hughes]], who was about to make the jump to directing. "For [Hall] to upstage Chevy, I thought, was a remarkable accomplishment for a 13-year-old kid," said Hughes.<ref name="16candles">{{cite web | publisher=People Weekly - June 4, 1984 | title= Sixteen Candles' sweet teens graduate to stardom by acting their own ages | author=Jeff Jarvis | url=http://www.riverblue.com/hughes/articles/sweet16teens.html|accessmonthday=September 30 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> The film was a significant box office hit in [[1983 in film|1983]], grossing over US$61 million in the United States.<ref>{{cite web | title= Box Office Mojo - ''National Lampoon's Vacation'' | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=nationallampoonsvacation.htm | accessmonthday=October 6 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> After ''Vacation'', Hall moved on to other projects and declined to reprise his role in the 1985 sequel.<ref>{{cite web | title=''National Lampoon's European Vacation''  Review | author=Russell Lee |  url=http://www.dvdbits.com/reviewprint.asp?id=3164 | accessmonthday=November 25 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> 

Hall's breakout role came in [[1984 in film|1984]], when he was cast as Farmer Ted, the scrawny, braces-wearing [[geek]] who pursued Molly Ringwald's character in John Hughes' directing debut ''[[Sixteen Candles]]''. Hall tried to avoid the clichés of geekness. "I didn't play him with 100 pens sticking out of his pocket," he said. "I just went in there and played it like a real kid. The geek is just a typical freshman."<ref name="16candles">{{cite web | publisher=People Weekly - June 4, 1984 | title= Sixteen Candles' sweet teens graduate to stardom by acting their own ages | author=Jeff Jarvis | url=http://www.riverblue.com/hughes/articles/sweet16teens.html | accessmonthday=September 30 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Hall landed a spot on the promotional materials, along with co-star Ringwald. Reviews of the film were positive for Hall and his co-stars, and one for ''[[People Weekly]]'' even claimed that Hall’s performance "[pilfered] the film" from Ringwald.<ref>{{cite web | publisher=People Weekly - May 14, 1984. | title= ''Sixteen Candles'' | author=Scot Haller | url=http://home.xnet.com/~madman/sc/sc-article3.html}} Retrieved October 22, 2006 from "Shermer, Illinois", a John Hughes fansite.</ref> Despite achieving moderate success at the box office, the film became an instant classic and made overnight stars of both Ringwald and Hall.

[[Image:Breakfastclubhall.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Hall in 1985's ''[[The Breakfast Club]]'']]
Hall starred in two [[1985 in film|1985]] teen classics, both written and directed by John Hughes. He was cast as Brian Johnson, "the brain," in the quintessential teen film ''[[The Breakfast Club]]'', co-starring [[Emilio Estevez]], [[Judd Nelson]], [[Ally Sheedy]], and Ringwald.

[[Art Garfunkel]], [[Edd Byrnes]], [[Bobby Kennedy]] and [[Daryl Hall]] were among Hall's celebrity impersonations.

After ''Scissorhands'', he appeared in a series of low-budget films, including the [[1992 in film|1992]] comedy ''Into the Sun'', where he starred as a visiting celebrity at a military air base.

Hall also directed an episode from season three, "The Cold Hard Truth," guest starring legendary standup comic [[Richard Lewis (comedian)|Richard Lewis]].

===In the media===
Hall became a regular subject of tabloid media after ''[[New York Magazine]]'' named him a member of the [[Brat Pack]], the group of young actors who became famous in the 1980s and frequently starred together.<ref>{{cite web | publisher=thebratpacksite.com | title= Brat Pack Origin | url=http://www.thebratpacksite.com/origin.html | accessmonthday=October 22 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> In the late 80s, Hall's drinking problem, which began in his early teens, made headlines.<ref name="geekgrowsup">{{cite web | publisher=People Weekly - March 9, 1992 | title= The Geek Grows Up | author=Tom Gliatto | url=http://www.riverblue.com/hughes/articles/geekgrowsup.html | accessmonthday=September 30 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Hall eventually quit drinking and became fully sober by 1990. "The truth is, I had my partying nights, but I never really bounced at the bottom," he said. "I never went to rehab...I was able to govern myself and continue my work."<ref name="ugodz">{{cite web | publisher=Underground Online | title= Anthony Michael Hall from The Dead Zone - Interview | author=Dan Epstein | url=http://www.ugo.com/channels/filmtv/features/anthonymichaelhall/ | accessmonthday=September 30 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

In 1990, Hall's physical appearance in ''Scissorhands'' caught audiences off guard. His more muscular image provoked rumors of steroids, but Hall later said that "the weight gain was natural."<ref name="aolchat">{{cite web | publisher=Hall's former official site hallofmirrors.com.

Hall's role in the 1993 film, ''Six Degrees of Separation'', managed to make news not because of what occurred onscreen, but rather what failed to occur. Hall played a gay love interest to Will Smith, who had previously agreed to a kissing scene between the two. However, on the day of the shoot, Smith backed off. Smith told the press that he called [[Denzel Washington]] for advice,<ref name="ugodz">{{cite web | publisher=Underground Online | title= Anthony Michael Hall from The Dead Zone - Interview | author=Dan Epstein | url=http://www.ugo.com/channels/filmtv/features/anthonymichaelhall/ | accessmonthday=September 30 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> who told him that an onscreen same-sex kiss was a bad career move.<ref>{{cite web | publisher=The Boston Globe - April 10, 2005| title= For all the steamy romance on-screen, the lip-locks often leave something to be desired | author=Wesley Morris | url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2005/04/10/kissed_off?pg=2 | accessmonthday=October 22 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> When asked about the incident during an interview, Hall said, "I didn't care.

===Recognition===

The [[2001 in film|2001]] film ''[[Not Another Teen Movie]]'' pays tribute to Hall's numerous appearances in the teen-oriented, 80s comedy films parodied by the movie. A brief shot of the sign over the door of a high school cafeteria reveals that the facility is named the "Anthony Michael Dining Hall."<ref>{{cite web | title=The John Hughes Files: References | url=http://www.riverblue.com/hughes/references.html | accessmonthday=November 25 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> In 2006, Hall was ranked # 4 in [[VH1]]'s list of the "100 Greatest Teen Stars"<ref>{{cite web | publisher=VH1.com | title= VH1's 100 Greatest Teen Stars #'s 20-1 | url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/the_greatest/97838/episode_featured_copy.jhtml | accessmonthday=September 29 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> and # 41 in "100 Greatest Kid Stars."<ref>{{cite web | publisher=VH1.com | title= VH1's 100 Greatest Kid Stars #'s 60-41 | url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/the_greatest/92321/episode_featured_copy.jhtml | accessmonthday=October 22 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

In June 2005, ''The Breakfast Club'' was rewarded with the "Silver Bucket of Excellence Award" at the [[MTV Movie Awards]], in honor of the film's twentieth anniversary. [[MTV]] attempted to reunite the original cast; Sheedy, Ringwald, and Hall appeared together on stage, and [[Paul Gleason]] personally gave the award to his former castmates. Estevez could not attend because of family commitments,<ref>{{cite web | publisher=contactmusic.com - July 11, 2005| title= Estevez is a definite for Breakfast Club reunion movie | url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/estevez%20is%20a%20definite%20for%20breakfast%20club%20reunion%20movie | accessmonthday=October 22 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> and Nelson appeared earlier on the red carpet<ref>{{cite web | publisher=USAToday.com - June 5, 2005| title= MTV awards honor actors | author=William Keck | url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2005-06-05-mtv-awards_x.htm|accessmonthday=October 22 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>  but left before the on-stage reunion for reasons unknown.
