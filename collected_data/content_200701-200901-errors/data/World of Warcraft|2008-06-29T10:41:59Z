'''''World of Warcraft''''' (commonly known as '''''WoW''''') is a [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] (MMORPG). It is [[Blizzard Entertainment]]'s fourth game set in the fantasy [[Warcraft universe|''Warcraft'' universe]], which was first introduced by ''[[Warcraft: Orcs & Humans]]'' in [[1994 in video gaming|1994]].<ref>Excluding [[expansion pack]]s and the canceled ''[[Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans]]''.</ref> ''World of Warcraft'' takes place within the world of [[Azeroth (world)|Azeroth]], four years after the events at the conclusion of Blizzard's previous release, ''[[Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne]]''.

During the 2007 [[BlizzCon]] event, Blizzard announced a second expansion pack called ''[[World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King|Wrath of the Lich King]]'' on [[August 3]], [[2007]].<ref name="wrathofficialsrc">{{cite web|title=Wrath of the Lich King - Official Site|url=http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/wrath/}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
{{main|Gameplay of World of Warcraft}}
Unlike previous games in the ''Warcraft'' series, ''World of Warcraft'' is a [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]], not a [[real-time strategy]] game. As with other MMORPGs, [[people]] control a character [[avatar (computing)|avatar]] within a persistent game world, exploring the landscape, fighting monsters, performing quests, building [[skill]]s, and interacting with [[Non-player character|NPC]]s, as well as other players. The game rewards success with in-game money, items, experience and reputation, all of which in turn allow players to improve their skill and power. Players can [[level up]] their characters from level one to level 60, level 70 if they have ''[[World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade|The Burning Crusade]]'' expansion. Upon release of the ''[[World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King|Wrath of the Lich King]]'' expansion, players will be able to attain level 80 after purchasing the expansion.<ref name="wrathofficialsrc"/> In addition, players may opt to take part in battles against other players of an enemy faction, in [[Player versus player|PvP]] battlegrounds or in normal world zones subject to the rules in place on the particular server. [[Duel]]s can also be fought between members of the same or opposing factions, although these do not provide tangible rewards. Many players also choose to join [[Clan (computer gaming)|guilds]]. Short-term parties and raid groups can be formed to conduct [[Raid (gaming)|raids]] against enemy territories and [[Instance dungeon|instances]].

===Characters===
There are two types of characters: [[Player Character]]s (PCs, or simply "players") and [[Non-Player Character]]s (NPCs). A Player Character is an avatar in the game environment that is controlled by a player, whilst Non-Player Characters are controlled by the game software and can only interact with PCs through scripted events or [[artificial intelligence]] (AI). There are three types of NPCs. Friendly NPCs cannot attack friendly characters and vice versa. Hostile NPCs are either of the opposing faction or are [[Mob (computer gaming)|mobs]] (enemies controlled by AI) and will freely attack any PC with whom they are hostile. Neutral NPCs will only attack if provoked. Some NPC interaction is affected by the [[#Reputation|reputation]] a PC has with them.

NPCs in major and minor cities can buy and sell merchandise, train class and profession skills, give [[quest]]s and provide a large number of services that are needed in the game. While some will merely offer advice or further the story, others, such as city guards, patrol around set paths to keep cities defended against attacking PCs or hostile NPCs that may attempt to invade. Guards can also provide directions to common locations within their city.

When creating a character in ''World of Warcraft'', the player can choose from ten different [[race (fantasy)|races]] in two factions: Alliance and Horde. Race determines the character's appearance, starting location, and initial skill set, called "racial traits".
*The Alliance currently consists of [[Warcraft (series)#Humans|Humans]], [[Warcraft (series)#Night Elves|Night Elves]], [[Warcraft (series)#Dwarfs|Dwarfs]], [[Warcraft (series)#Gnomes|Gnome]]s and [[Warcraft (series)#Draenei|Draenei]].
*The Horde currently consists of [[Warcraft (series)#Orcs|Orc]]s, [[Warcraft (series)#Tauren|Tauren]], [[Warcraft (series)#Undead|Undead]], [[Warcraft (series)#Trolls|Troll]]s and [[Warcraft (series)#Blood Elves|Blood Elves]].
Draenei<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/09/technology/10warcraftqa.web.html?_r=1&oref=slogin Interview: Jeff Kaplan on World of Warcraft Expansion], New York Times</ref> and Blood Elf characters were introduced in ''The Burning Crusade'', and require that expansion in order to be created.

In addition to the ten playable races, there are many NPC races including (but not limited to) Goblins<ref name="wowgoblin">[[wowwiki:Goblin]]</ref>, Ogres<ref name="wowogre">[[wowwiki:Ogre]]</ref>, Murlocs<ref name="wowmurloc">[[wowwiki:Murloc]]</ref>, and Naga<ref name="wownaga">[[wowwiki:Naga]]</ref>.

==== Classes ====

The game has nine [[character class]]es that a player can choose from, though not all classes are available for each race. Each class has a set of unique abilities and talents. Abilities are general skills and spells available to the entire class, while talents allow players to specialize their character and further refine their role. Each class has a set of three talent trees. Depending on class, players may choose to build their character's talent trees for damage-dealing (also called damage-per-second, or DPS), healing, [[Tank (gaming)|tanking]], or a mix of these.<ref name="wowclasses">{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/index.html|title=Classes in World of Warcraft at official US site|accessdate=2007-02-26}}</ref> Some classes, known as "hybrid classes," are able to perform different roles depending on a group's needs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/basics/partyroles.html |title=Party Roles |accessdate=2007-10-19 |author=Blizzard Entertainment}}</ref>

The nine available classes in ''World of Warcraft'' are:

*Druid<ref name="wowdruid">[[wowwiki:Druid]]</ref> (Hybrid class) <!-- This is a basic description of the class, not a "list of forms". Please do not add info for any of the classes more detailed than the official WoW page. --> 
:A nature-oriented class capable of fulfilling the role of damage-dealer, tank, or healer. The druid can [[shape-shift]] into many animal forms to increase its combat or movement abilities. In humanoid form, the druid can cast a variety of healing or damaging spells.

*Hunter<ref name="wowhunter">[[wowwiki:Hunter]]</ref> (Ranged damage class)
:A combination of a [[marksman]]/[[archery|archer]] and animal specialist, the hunter specializes in ranged damage dealt by means of a [[bow (weapon)|bow]], [[crossbow]], or [[gun]] with the help of an animal [[pet]]. The hunter also employs a series of traps for damaging or disabling enemies.

*Mage<ref name="wowmage">[[wowwiki:Mage]]</ref> (Spell damage class)
:The [[wizard]]-esque damage-dealer of ''World of Warcraft'', the mage employs spells of the "[[arcane]]", fire, and frost elements. They have minimal armor. Mages can also conjure food and water to replenish group members, and [[teleport]] themselves and others to most major cities.

*Paladin<ref name="wowpaladin">[[wowwiki:Paladin]]</ref> (Hybrid class)
:A heavily armored holy warrior. Like druids, paladins can specialize to fulfill each of the three major roles in ''World of Warcraft''. (''See also: [[Paladin (character class)#Warcraft]]''.)

*Priest<ref name="wowpriest">[[wowwiki:Priest]]</ref> (Healer/Spell damage class)
:A lightly armored class that can protect and heal allies (with "Holy" spells) or bring harm to enemies (with "Shadow" spells).

*Rogue<ref name="wowrogue">[[wowwiki:Rogue]]</ref> (Melee damage class)
:A shadowy assassin that can "stealth" to avoid being seen by enemies (providing near-invisibility). The rogue deals damage by dual-wielding small [[melee weapon]]s, and also provides traditional thief skills like [[lock-picking]], [[pickpocket]]ing, and [[poisoning]].

*Shaman<ref name="wowshaman">[[wowwiki:Shaman]]</ref> (Hybrid class)
:Unlike other hybrid classes (paladins and druids), the [[totem]]-wielding shaman's tanking abilities are quite limited. However, they can specialize to become effective healers, or damage dealers using either melee weapons or spells.

*Warlock<ref name="wowwarlock">[[wowwiki:Warlock]]</ref> (Spell damage class)
:A sinister combination of the mage and the hunter, the warlock deals magical damage like a mage, but also has demonic "pets" (called minions) like hunters. Depending on their specialization, the warlock's damaging spells can come chiefly in the form of "damage over time" spells that, after being placed on an enemy, slowly deal damage, or in the form of direct damage spells that deal damage all at once, as those of a mage or shaman do.

*Warrior<ref name="wowwarrior">[[wowwiki:Warrior]]</ref> (Tank/[[melee]] damage class)
:A heavily armored class, the warrior is a general melee fighter who can wield any non-magical weapon in the game.

The Paladin class was previously only available to the Alliance, and the Shaman only available to the Horde. Now, with the release of ''The Burning Crusade'', the Draenei (Alliance) are able to be shamans and the Blood Elves (Horde) are able to be paladins, removing the previous faction exclusivity.
 
In the upcoming ''[[Wrath of the Lich King]]'' expansion, a tenth class known as the Death Knight<ref name="wowdeathknight">[[wowwiki:Death Knight]]</ref> will be added, which will also be the game's first Hero class.<ref name="wrathofficialsrc"/>  Similar to the Warrior class, Death Knight abilities will involve tanking and dealing melee damage.<ref name="dkgameplay">{{cite web |url=http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/wrath/features/deathknight/gameplay.xml|title=Death Knight Gameplay |accessdate= 2008-05-20 |author=Blizzard |authorlink=Blizzard Entertainment |format=HTML}}</ref>

====Items and equipment====
Player characters can acquire various "items" in the game, which can aid in character customization, or which can otherwise be of aid to them. Items can vary from resources such as herbs or raw ores to items to be retrieved for quests. Player characters can also equip different weapons and armor, either to customize their character or to improve abilities (such as better attack or defense skills).<ref>[http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/items/basics.html WoW Basic Info on Items] ''Blizzard Entertainment. Retrieved 19-09-07.'' </ref> Items improve character effectiveness to a level where this makes acquisition of these items necessary and highly desirable for progression. ''World of Warcraft''’s item mechanics are complex.  They have undergone many changes in an attempt to keep the system balanced. Items play a significant role in the outcome of all confrontations within the game and a character’s effectiveness is directly related to the quality of gear currently equipped. After the release of the [[World of Warcraft Trading Card Game]], players could redeem codes found on "loot cards" for in-game items.

One of the more notable items are "mounts", which are items or spells which, when activated, summon an animal or machine which increase the character's land movement speed. In the expansion pack ''The Burning Crusade'', the ability to purchase or acquire flying mounts became available in the expansion areas. Each playable race can use a certain mount type most powerfully associated with their race.<ref>[http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/basics/mounts/index.html WoW Basic Info on Mounts] ''Blizzard Entertainment. Retrieved 2008-03-25.'' </ref>

====Professions====
During the course of playing the game, players may choose to develop side skills for their character(s). These non-combat skills are called professions. Professions<ref name="wowprofessions">[[wowwiki:profession]]</ref> are divided into two categories, primary and secondary<ref name="wowskills">[[wowwiki:Professions#Professions and secondary skills]]</ref>.

'''Primary professions''' are skills related to the creation and enhancement of items (weapons, armor, potions, and other useful devices), and can be subdivided into gathering and crafting professions. The gathering professions in ''WoW'' are herbalism, mining, and skinning. Crafting professions include blacksmithing, leatherworking, tailoring, alchemy, engineering, enchanting, jewelcrafting (added in ''The Burning Crusade'' expansion), and inscription (to be added in the ''Wrath of the Lich King'' expansion<ref name="wrathofficialsrc"/>). Crafting professions also have specialization categories that when trained, allow for more diverse items to be created, depending on the character's direction in the game. There is also the Enchanting profession, which allows a character to enchant weapons and armor, and also disenchant magical items in his or her possession. A character is limited to two primary professions.

'''Secondary professions''' are skills that serve to enhance the player's experience and self-sufficiency. The secondary professions are first aid, cooking, and fishing. Characters can learn all three secondary professions. The Rogue class has two unique secondary professions: poisons and lock-picking.

====PvP rankings====
Upon defeating another player of the opposite faction in [[player versus player]] (PvP) combat the victor earns "Honor Points". Some servers allow for unrestricted PvP in most areas of the game, while others restrict this so-called "world PvP" to voluntary action only. All players also may choose to participate in the Battlegrounds - areas designed for multiplayer combat. In addition to honor points, the losing team in a Battleground receives one "mark of honor", while the winning team earns three marks. Honor Points and marks may be spent as currency to purchase various rewards like armor, weapons and mounts. Prior to patch 2.0.1, significant PvP achievements would allow characters to display various titles. After the patch new titles are no longer available; however, previously earned titles can still be displayed.

The Arenas,<ref>Arena facts taken from http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/pvp/arena/index.xml</ref> added in ''The Burning Crusade'', offer gladiator-like combat in a ''World of Warcraft'' setting. The Arenas have a separate system from the Battlegrounds. Instead of honor, the Arenas give "Arena Points" which can be spent to purchase items in a manner similar to Honor Points. Only level 70 players can participate in rated arena matches. Lower level players can participate in practice arena matches, or "skirmishes", but no arena points are awarded.

The Arena system is broken into seasons. At the end of each season the best Arena teams in each category (2 versus 2, 3 versus 3 and 5 versus 5) are rewarded with titles.<ref> http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/pvp/arena/index.xml bottom part of the page</ref> From highest to lowest these ranks are Merciless Gladiator, Gladiator, Duelist, Rival and Challenger.

====Reputation====
The reputation system is complex and can have direct impact on character advancement. In ''World of Warcraft'', there are many groups of NPCs known as "factions". The two primary factions are the Alliance and the Horde, and each one features a large number of sub-factions primarily based on race and geographic location. Characters' reputation with a faction can be increased or decreased by killing certain mobs, completing quests, or handing in items to certain NPCs. Higher reputation can grant many benefits to characters including reduced prices from vendors, the ability to purchase unique items including specialized mounts, and expanded access to certain areas of the game.<ref>[http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/basics/reputation.html WoW Basic Info on Reputations] ''Blizzard Entertainment. Retrieved 2008-03-25.'' </ref>

However, characters cannot gain reputation with opposing factions, so a Horde character cannot gain reputation with any Alliance-only faction and vice versa. There are also diametrically opposed factions in which gaining reputation with one will result in loss of reputation with another.

====Quests====
Quests in WoW are tasks given to PCs by NPCs. The completion of quests provides many different rewards to the player, including reputation, experience, items, and gold. There are a variety of quests available, from single objective tasks to epic multi-step endeavors. Currently (BC-patch 2.4) there are more than 2000 quests in ''World of Warcraft''.

===Instances===
Instances, also known as [[instance dungeon]]s or simply "dungeons", are areas where multiple copies of the same area can exist concurrently.<ref name="Instancing">{{cite web |url=http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/basics/instancing.html |title=Instancing |accessdate=2007-01-18 |author=Blizzard Entertainment}}</ref> This means that multiple groups can both be doing the same activities in the same location, yet not interfere with one another. "Instance" can also refer to a particular copy of such an area. Other areas such as battlegrounds are also instances, enabling multiple groups of players to participate at the same time in areas such as Warsong Gulch, Alterac Valley, Arathi Basin and Eye of the Storm which are split into different level range depending on participants. Instances other than battlegrounds can hold as many as forty different players each, pitting them against dragons or other creatures of greater power.

Instance in ''World of Warcraft'' are designed around specific level ranges and general group setups. Currently (BC-patch 2.4) instances are designed around 5-player groups, 10-player groups and 25-player groups. Instances permitting 10 or more players are referred to as raid instances. In ''The Burning Crusade'' expansion, Blizzard created a heroic difficulty mode for the 5-player instances found in Outland. Heroic difficulty is designed around maximum level characters.

Generally, to complete an instance, a group must be comprised of players that fill three roles. These are the “tank” (withstand attacks and protect other characters), “healer” (heal the damage caused by attacks), and “DPS” (Damage per Second, whose main concern is damaging enemies).

===Realms===
''World of Warcraft'' uses server clusters (known as "realms") to allow players to choose their preferred gameplay type and to allow the game to support as many subscribers as it does. There are four types of realms: Normal (also known as PvE or [[player versus environment]]), PvP (player versus player), RP (a [[roleplaying]] Normal/PvE server) and RP-PvP (roleplaying PvP server):

* Normal
:On the Normal (also know as PvE, Player versus Environment) realms throughout most of the world players cannot attack or be attacked by each other, except by actively enabling the character's PvP flag, attacking a PvP-flagged character, entering a "PvP Territory" (such as a Battleground) or an enemy faction Capital City, or casting a positive spell on a friendly PvP-flagged character. The PvP flag is removed after 5 minutes from the last PvP action. If the PvP flag was enabled using the command the player will need to turn it off using the same command and then avoid PvP combat for 5 minutes.

* PVP (Player versus Player)
:On a PvP realm, players are flagged for PvP by default. This flag is only disabled when a character is in a friendly faction city or a zone dedicated to newly created characters. All other zones are considered "contested territory" where players are automatically flagged for PvP upon entering. Most players will not need to enter a contested zone until roughly level 20.

:On PvP servers, a player is limited to creating characters on one faction. This is in contrast to PvE servers, where a player may create characters from both factions.

:The PvP servers also feature a more "hands–off" approach to server policies, facilitating the state of open war in these servers. Thus, The in-game GMs will deal with PvP related offenses differently than on the PvE realms, and some player actions are allowed to occur.<ref name="pvp policy">{{cite web |url=http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?articleId=20456 |title=Player vs Player Server Policy |accessdate=2008-03-08 |publisher=Blizzard Entertainment}}</ref> These actions include, but are not limited to, [[corpse camping]], [[ganking]], and other PvP related sections of Blizzard's harassment policy.

* RP (Roleplaying)
:The roleplaying servers use the same ruleset as PvE realms, with the exception that players must act and behave [[in character]], and must follow "naming rules" when they name their character. On these realms, players act and speak as their characters would, and anything said [[out of character]] is usually preceded by "OOC:" or presented in ((double parentheses)). It is also against the rules to be off-topic in all public channels, such as General and Trade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blizzard.com/support/wowgm/?id=agm01725p|title=Roleplaying Policy|work=World of Warcraft In-Game Support Knowledge Base|publisher=[[Blizzard Entertainment]]|author=Blizzard Entertainment|date=[[2006]]|accessdate=2006-10-27}}</ref>

* RP-PvP (Roleplaying Player versus Player)
:The roleplaying PvP realms are an extension to the role-playing realms that use the PvP ruleset instead of the Normal (PvE) ruleset. Blizzard did not initially have this server type when the game was launched; it was added later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/656/656255p1.html|title=World of Warcraft RP PvP - Checking out the new flavor of roleplaying. Huzzah!|publisher=[[IGN]]|author=Tom McNamara|date=2005-10-05|accessdate=2008-01-05}}</ref>

* Public test realm <!-- Removed capitalization here as these are refered to as 'a' test server/realm below, rather than 'the' test server/realm -->
:A public test realm, also called a test server, is used to test features in development for the next patch. Players can copy a character to the test realm or can sometimes copy a premade character. Players on test realms may encounter character wipes, item wipes, or frequent downtime to make changes or apply patches.

Users may have up to ten characters per realm and up to a maximum of fifty characters per account.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/faq/characters.html|title=Characters FAQ|work=World of Warcraft Game Guide|publisher=[[Blizzard Entertainment]]|author=Blizzard Entertainment|date=[[2006]]|accessdate=2006-09-06}}</ref> Characters can be moved between realms in the same region (e.g., from one European server to another, but not from a European server to an American one) for a fee.

Blizzard posts announcements on the login screen of ''World of Warcraft'' and on the official forums about realm status or other technical issues. The status for each realm can also be viewed on their main website.


===Modifications===
[[Image:Modified WoW User Interface.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Comparison of a default ''World of Warcraft'' user interface (Top) to a heavily modified one.(Bottom)]]''World of Warcraft'' includes significant support for modifications to the [[user interface]] (UI) of a game, colloquially known as "[[Mod (computer gaming)|mods]]" and "[[Plugin|addons]]". At a simple level it allows full control over the content of toolbars and [[Keyboard shortcut|hot keys]], as well as [[Macro (computer science)|macros]] to automate sets of operations and the ability to script much more elaborate tools. The range of modifications that are available can be anything from ways to automatically advertise trade skills, to adding extra rows of button bars for spells, skills and more, to one designed for humorous intent, such as one that reproduces the infamous [[Leeroy Jenkins]] sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wow.curse-gaming.com/en/files/details/897/rhysls-leroy-jenkins-battle-cry/|title=''Leeroy Jenkins!!!'' sound clip mod}}</ref> The 2.0 release of ''World of Warcraft'' changed the way that an addon interacts with the game, causing certain modifications and addons to no longer function as intended. This meant that all addons designed before the patch needed to be rewritten, or they would not work.

Addons in ''World of Warcraft'' are coded using one or both [[Lua programming language|Lua]] and [[XML]], and images used for modifications are created using the [[TGA|.TGA (Targa)]] and [[.BLP]] image formats. Blizzard has also released a User Interface Customization tool to support and encourage UI modders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blizzard.com/support/wow/?id=aww01669p|title=Blizzard's WoW User Interface Customization tool download}}</ref> However, Blizzard is unable to endorse or provide support for third party interfaces due to issues that may be caused by them.

Some third-party programs that operate in a stand-alone mode, or independent of ''World of Warcraft'', may be considered [[Exploit (online gaming)|exploits]], especially if they automate operation beyond that made available using the built-in macro functionality, or pass information in or out of the game. Use of these is against [[Blizzard Entertainment]]'s Terms of Use. When playing the game, and as such, may lead to possible suspension or closure of accounts. Blizzard has stated on the official forums that any modification that uses the Lua programming language will not be considered an exploit, though Blizzard reserves the right to change information available via the Lua language if the modification changes the nature of encounters in the game.<ref name="WoWToU_righttochange">{{cite web |url=http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/legal/termsofuse.html |title=Terms of Use |accessdate=2007-01-18 |author=Blizzard Entertainment |authorlink=Blizzard Entertainment |date=2007-01-11 |language=English |quote=Section 9, Changes to&nbsp;... the Program }}</ref>

===Voice chat===
In patch 2.2.0, Blizzard introduced an in-game voice chat feature. This feature is intended to complement the traditional text chat with a more efficient means of communication between players. Similar to text chat, voice chat is limited to communications between characters of the same faction. Channels can be set for various purposes such as groups, instances, raids, battlegrounds or general zones. Players may also join, create and moderate their own channels.<ref>http://worldofwarcraft.com/info/basics/voicechat.html bottom part of the page</ref> Players may enable this feature through the in-game options; no [[third-party developer|third-party]] applications are needed. Options for "push-to-talk" and "voice activated" modes are available. A microphone and speaker are required however, as with other similar voice chat products.

===2008 Arena Tournament===
Early in 2008 Blizzard announced they would be creating multiple Arena Realms in conjunction with patch 2.4, this realm would be to give anyone that considered themselves skilled enough the opportunity to compete against one another. These realms are completely separate from the current arena season rewards and give cash rewards instead. In order to be eligible for the rewards of this tournament the player must compete in various matches and meet requirements set by Blizzard.<ref>[http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/pvp/tournament/index.xml WoW -> PvP -> 2008 World of Warcraft Arena Tournament Information<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Setting==
[[Image:WoW Map Cosmic.jpg|thumb|right|''World of Warcraft'' Cosmic Map (Including 'Outland')]]
The current [[virtual world]] consists of two planets, Azeroth and Draenor (also known as "Outland"). Azeroth consists of two main continents, the Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor. Located to the northwest of Kalimdor are the Azuremyst and Bloodmyst Isles, and Teldrassil.

Kalimdor contains the starting areas for the Orc, Troll, and Tauren races of the Horde. The Night Elves and Draenei of the Alliance both begin in areas off the coast of Kalimdor (Teldrassil and Azuremyst and Bloodmyst Isles respectively). The Night Elves have the capability to move to the mainland fairly early as well. The Eastern Kingdoms contain the beginning areas for the Undead and Blood Elves of the Horde, as well as the Humans, Dwarves and Gnomes of the Alliance.

Draenor, added with the release of ''The Burning Crusade'', is only accessible to those who have purchased and activated the expansion pack. It is reached through the Dark Portal in the south of the Eastern Kingdoms or through in-game teleportation. Draenor was the original home of the Orcs and was also inhabited by the Draenei for over 200 years.

The ''Wrath of the Lich King'' expansion will add the continent of Northrend in the northern region of Azeroth and will be available exclusively to those players who purchase and activate that expansion pack.<ref name="wrathofficialsrc"/>

World of Warcraft was first announced by Blizzard at the [[European Computer Trade Show|ECTS]] trade show in September 2001.<ref name="ECTS">{{cite web|title=ECTS 2001:World of Warcraft|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/worldofwarcraft/news.html?sid=2810134|publisher=Gamespot|accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> Development of the game took about five years with extensive testing done to make sure everything was ready for launch.

''World of Warcraft'' runs natively on both [[Macintosh]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] platforms. Boxed copies of the game use a [[hybrid CD]] to install the game, eliminating the need for separate Mac and Windows retail products. The game allows all users to play together, regardless of their [[operating system]]. Although there is no official version for any other platform, support for ''World of Warcraft'' is present in Windows [[application programming interface|API]] implementations [[Wine (software)|Wine]] and [[Cedega]], allowing the game to be played under [[Linux]] and [[FreeBSD]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://appdb.winehq.org/appview.php?iVersionId=6482|title=Wine application notes for WoW}}</ref>

===Post-launch development===

[[Image:World of Warcraft Launcher 1.1 (11).png|thumb|right|200px|World of Warcraft Launcher]]
The ''World of Warcraft'' Launcher (referred to in press releases and the menu bar as the "Blizzard Launcher") is a program designed to act as a starting point for ''World of Warcraft'' players. It was first included with the version 1.8.3 patch. The 2.1.0 patch allowed for an option to bypass the use of the launcher. Features of the launcher include news and updates for ''World of Warcraft'' players, access to ''World of Warcraft's'' support website, access to the test version of ''World of Warcraft'' when it is live on the test servers in order to test upcoming patches, updates to [[Warden (software)|Warden]],<ref name="warden_updates">{{cite web |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/11/15/world_of_warcraft_warden_encryption/ |title=World of Warcraft spykit gets encrypted |accessdate=2008-03-08 |last=Modine |first=Austin |date=2007-11-15 |publisher=The Register}}</ref> and updates to the updater itself.

The World of Warcraft Launcher’s built-in cheat-program scanner, Warden, is considered an additional level of security and is primarily used to protect the customers' interests by continuously monitoring cheats and hidden [[Malware|malicious]] programs (also referred to as "Malware") that collect information such as account names and passwords. Although it does not report any specific information back to Blizzard, a player risks having his or her account closed if a cheat is detected.

[[Patch (computing)|Patch]] 1.9.3 added native support for [[Apple-Intel architecture|Intel-powered Macs]], making ''World of Warcraft'' a [[Universal binary|Universal application]] (as defined by Apple). As a result of this, the minimum supported Mac OS X version has been changed to 10.3.9; ''World of Warcraft'' version 1.9.3 and later will not launch on older versions of Mac OS X.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/patchnotes/patch1p9.html|title="World of Warcraft Client Patch 1.9.3 (2006-02-07)" patch notes}}</ref>

Due to the fact that new content is constantly being added to the game official system requirements often change. In version 1.12.0 the requirements for Windows were increased from requiring 256&nbsp;MB to 512&nbsp;MB of RAM. Official [[Windows 98]] technical support was dropped, even though the game continued to run fine until version 2.2.3.<ref>

</ref> After version 2.2.3, the official patches to version 2.3.0 failed on [[operating system]]s earlier than Windows 2000. By knowledgeably using an old update executable with new patch data, Windows 98 and Windows ME users could update from 2.2.3 using one of the released patches. Once successfully upgraded, the new version of the game then worked with Windows ME, although version 2.3.0 did not work with Windows 98 Second Edition unless applying updates to the operating system, including an unofficial third party's operating system modifications.<ref>{{cite web

===Corrupted Blood plague incident===
{{main|Corrupted Blood}}
The Corrupted Blood plague incident was one of the first events to affect entire servers. Patch 1.7 saw the opening of Zul'Gurub, the game's first 20-player raid dungeon where players faced off against an ancient tribe of jungle trolls under the sway of the ancient Blood God, Hakkar the Soulflayer. Upon engaging Hakkar, players were stricken by a [[Buff (computer_gaming)#Debuff|debuff]] called "Corrupted Blood" which would periodically sap their life. The disease would also be passed on to other players who were simply standing close to an infected person. Originally this malady was confined within the Zul'Gurub instance but made its way into the outside world by way of hunter or warlock pets that contracted the disease.

Within hours Corrupted Blood had infected entire cities such as Ironforge and Orgrimmar because of their high player concentrations. Low-level players were killed in seconds by the high-damage disease. Eventually Blizzard fixed the issue so that the plague could not exist outside of Zul'Gurub.

The corrupted blood plague so closely resembled the [[outbreak]] of real-world [[epidemic]]s that scientists are currently looking at ways MMORPGs or other massively-distributed systems can model human behavior during outbreaks. The reaction of players to the plague closely resembled previously hard-to-model aspects of human behavior that may allow researchers to more accurately predict how diseases and outbreaks spread amongst a population.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6951918.stm BBC NEWS | Health | Virtual game is a 'disease model'<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Pricing ==
[[Image:ExWoW2.jpg|thumb|right|The current login screen, as of the release of [[World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade|''The Burning Crusade'']]]]
''World of Warcraft'' is priced differently in different regions of the world. Usually, the pricing model is similar to that of MMORPGs previously released in the market.

In the United States and Canada, Blizzard distributes ''World of Warcraft'' via [[retail software]] packages that originally had a suggested retail price of [[United States dollar|US$]]49.99 at the time of release,<ref name="blizz_release_pr">{{cite web |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/worldofwarcraft/news.html?sid=6112390&mode=press |title=Blizzard Entertainment Announces World of Warcraft Street Date - [[November 23]], [[2004]] |accessdate=2008-03-08 |date=2004-11-04 |publisher=Blizzard Entertainment}}</ref> but have since dropped to $19.99. The software package includes 30 days of gameplay (worth $15) for no additional cost. In order to continue playing after the initial 30 days, additional play time must be purchased using a credit card or prepaid game card. The minimum gameplay duration that a player can purchase is 30 days using a credit card, or 60 using a prepaid game card. A player also has the option of purchasing three or six months of gameplay at once for a slight (6% to 15%) discount. A player pays about US$0.50 for one day of gameplay.<ref>{{cite web

|date=2007
|accessdate=2007-04-25
}}</ref>

In South Korea, there is no software package or CD key requirement to activate the account. In order to play the game, however, players need to purchase time credits online via credit card or the ARS billing system. The minimum gameplay duration that a player can purchase via credit card is five hours. A player may also purchase game time by thirty hours or by increments of one week. A player also has the option of purchasing game time by one, three, or six months of gameplay at once for a slight discount.<ref>{{cite web

|accessdate=2006-12-17
}}</ref> As of [[December 17]] [[2006]], 30 days of gameplay costs [[South Korean won|₩]]19,800 (US$21.46).

In China, because a large number of the players do not own the computer they use to play games (e.g. [[Internet cafe]]s), the CD keys can be purchased independently of the software package. The CD key, which is required to activate an account, is sold for [[Renminbi|¥]]30 (US$3.75) each. The software packages vary in price depending on the items they contain. In order to play the game, players must purchase prepaid game cards in denominations of ¥30 each that can be played for 66 hours and 40 minutes.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> This equates to exactly ¥0.45 (US$0.06) for one hour of gameplay. A monthly fee model is not available to players of this region.

In Australia, the United States, and many European countries, video game stores commonly stock the trial version of ''World of Warcraft'' in DVD form priced at [[Australian dollar|A$]]2 or [[Euros|€]]2 including [[VAT]], which include the game and 14 days of gameplay, after which the player would have to upgrade to a retail account by supplying a valid credit card, or purchasing a game card as well as a retail copy of the game.

''World of Warcraft'' was almost universally praised by critics<ref name="metacritic_score" /> upon release, following a period of high anticipation before launch.<ref name="atrip_review" /> Although the game follows a similar model to others in the genre<ref name="gamespot_review" /> and was noted for having many familiar concepts from [[roleplaying game]]s,<ref name="1up_review" /> the new approaches to reduce pauses between game encounters, was well liked.<ref name="gamespy_review" /> A common example was the new approach to character death; in previous [[MMORPG]]s a player would suffer a high penalty for character death, while in ''WoW'' a player would be able to recover and start playing quickly.<ref name="gamespot_review" /> Combat was another area where "downtime" or pauses between play were reduced. By allowing all character types to recover from damage taken, players could return to combat quickly.<ref name="gamespy_review" /> It was felt that these changes in pacing would make the genre more accessible to casual players, who would be able to play for short periods and still achieve something,<ref name="gamespy_review" /> while still having a depth of game that would attract players at all levels of interest in the genre.<ref name="ign_review" /> The concept of a "rested bonus", or increasing the rate at which a player's character gains experience was also welcomed as a way for players to quickly catch up with their friends<ref name="gamespot_review" />

[[Quest (gaming)|Questing]] was described as an integral part, often being used to continue a storyline or lead the player through the game.<ref name="gamespy_review" /> The high number of quests in each location was popular, as well as the rewards for completing them.<ref name="gamespot_review" /> It was felt that the range of quests removed the need for a player to "grind" or carry out repetetive tasks in order to advance their character.<ref name="ign_review" /> Quests also seemed to require players to explore every section of the game world, potentially causing problems for social gamers or roleplayers seeking somewhere quiet.<ref name="gamespy_review" />  Quests that required the player to collect items from the corpses of creatures they had killed were also unpopular, with a low "drop rate" or chance of finding the items required making them feel repetitive as a high number of creatures would need to be killed in order to complete the quest.<ref name="ign_review" /> Some critics mentioned a lack of quests that required players to group up made the game feel as if it was designed for solo play,<ref name="eurogamer_review" /> while others complained that some dungeon or instance-based group quests were not frienly to new players and could take several hours to complete.<ref name="ign_review" /> Upon release, a small number of quests had errors or [[Software bug|bugs]] that would make them impossible to complete,<ref name="gamespot_review" /> while the large number of new players in a particular area meant that there were often no creatures to kill,<ref name="gamespy_review" /> or that players would have to wait and take turns to kill a particular creature in order to complete a quest.<ref name="gamespot_review" />

Characters were felt to be implemented well, with each class option appearing "viable and interesting" while still having unique and different mechanisms,<ref name="eurogamer_review" /> and each of the races having a distinct look and feel.<ref name="gamespot_review" /> Character development was also liked, with the talent mechanism offering choice to players<ref name="1up_review" /> and profession options being praised.<ref name="gamespot_review" /> Character customisation options were felt to be low,<ref name="ign_review" /> but the detail of character models was praised.<ref name="atrip_review" />

The appearance of the game world was hughly praised by critics. Most popular was the feature that a player could run from one end of the continent to the other without having to pause at a "loading screen" while part of the game is retrieved from storage.<ref name="atrip_review" /> The environment was described as "breathtaking", with players finding it difficult to be come lost and each area in the game world having a distinct look that blends from one to the next.<ref name="gamespy_review" /> Critics described the environemnt as "a careful blend of cartoon, fantasy art and realism".<ref name="1up_review" /> The game was found to run smoothly on a range of systems,<ref name="gamespot_review" /> although some described it as basic<ref name="gamespy_review" /> and mentioned that the [[bloom (shader effect)|bloom]] graphics effect can blur things.<ref name="ign_review" /> Having said that, one reviewer described being able to fly over long stretches of scenery as "very atmospheric".<ref name="eurogamer_review" /> The user interface was liked, being described as "sumple", with [[tooltip]]s helping to get the player started.<ref name="gamespot_review" />

The audio was well recieved, particularly the background music. By assigning music to different areas of the game world, reviewers felt that the fantasy style added to immersion<ref name="1up_review" /> and that the replay value was increased.<ref name="ign_review" /> The sounds and voices used by characters and [[non-player character|NPC]]s, as well as the overall sound effects were felt to add a "personality" to the game.<ref name="1up_review" />

''World of Warcraft'' won several awards from critics upon release, including Editor's Choice awards.<ref name="ign_review" /><ref name="gamespot_review"/> In addition, it won several annual awards from the media, being described as the best game in the [[RPG]] and [[MMORPG]] class.<ref name="gamespy_goty">{{cite web |title=Game of the Year Awards-PC Genre |publisher=[[GameSpy]] |url=http://goty.gamespy.com/2004/pc/index12.html |author= |date= |accessdate=2008-06-25}}</ref> The graphics and audio were also praised in the annual awards, with the cartoonish style<ref name="gamespy_special">{{cite web |title=PC Special Awards |publisher=[[GameSpy]] |url=http://goty.gamespy.com/2004/pc/index16.html |author= |date= |accessdate=2008-06-25}}</ref> and overall sound makeup<ref name="ve_audio">{{cite web |title=2004 PC Game of the Year Awards |publisher=[[Voodoo Extreme]] |url=http://ve3d.ign.com/articles/features/12150/2004-PC-Game-of-the-Year-Awards |author=Robert Howarth |date=2004-12-24 |accessdate=2008-06-25}}</ref> being noted.

==Controversy and criticism==
{{main|Criticism of World of Warcraft}}
Despite its popularity, ''WoW'' has been criticized for a number of reasons.

=== Game addiction ===
Stories of [[game addiction]] are a common source of criticism of WoW, earning it the nickname "World of Warcrack".<ref name="wired warcrack">{{cite web |url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/warcraft.html |title=World of Warcrack  |accessdate=2008-03-08 |author=Joi Ito  |date=2006-06  |publisher=Wired}}</ref> In June 2005 it was reported that a child had died due to [[neglect]] by her ''World of Warcraft''-addicted parents in South Korea.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200506/200506140037.html|title=http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200506/200506140037.html|title= Infant Daughter Dies as Parents Play Online Game|publisher=Chosun|date=2005-06-14|accessdate=2008-05-11}}</ref> In August of that year, the government of the [[People's Republic of China]] proposed new rules to curb what it perceived to be social and financial costs brought on by the popularity of online games in general. The measure would enforce a time limit on China's estimated total of 20 million gamers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4183340.stm|title=China imposes online gaming curbs|publisher=BBC|date=[[25 August]] [[2005]]}}</ref>

Dr. [[Maressa Orzack]], a clinical psychologist at McLean Hospital in [[Newton, Massachusetts]], was interviewed [[August 8]], [[2006]], stating that of the 6 million subscribers "I'd say that 40 percent of the players are addicted."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.twitchguru.com/2006/08/08/world_of_warcraft_players_addicted/|title=Expert: 40 Percent of World of Warcraft Players Addicted|publisher=TwitchGuru|date=[[8 August]] [[2006]]}}</ref> The 40% figure was not derived from a scientific study overseen by Orzack, but rather came from "a forum that Nick Yee runs." She added in an August 2006 interview that "even if the percentage is 5 to 10 percent which is standard for most addictive behaviors, it is a huge number of people who are out of control."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060809-7459.html|title=Ars Technica interview with Dr. Orzack, 8/9/2006}}</ref> Also, according to Dr. John Grohol, a colleague of Orzack's, "Dr. Orzack is not claiming that up to 40 percent of ''World of Warcraft'' gamers are addicted based upon any actual evidence or surveys of players. This is just her opinion, based upon her own experience and observation of the problem."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2006/08/10/expert-40%-of-world-of-warcraft-players-addicted/|title=PsychCentral - John M. Grohol, Psy.D., [[August 10]], [[2006]]}}</ref>

=== Spam problems === 
After Blizzard started offering free trial gameplay accounts, players started receiving increasing numbers of [[Spam (electronic)|spam]] sent by [[Computer game bot|bots]] in the virtual mailboxes of their characters, advertising virtual gold, honor, and experience selling services.<ref>[http://gigaom.com/2006/11/26/world-of-warcraft-gold-farmers/ GigaOM: Inside World of Warcraft Gold Farm, Future of Work] by Wagner James Au, retrieved 2007-01-13</ref> One study shows that this problem is particularly prevalent on the European realms.<ref>[http://www.gamerprice.com/wow-gold-study.html World of Warcraft Gold Farmer Study] by GamerPrice and Sheffield University, retrieved 2007-01-26</ref> In patch 2.1, Blizzard responded to this by adding additional anti-spam mechanics including whisper throttling, and the ''report spam'' function. Additionally, trial accounts are prevented from speaking in the public chat channels (although they may speak to players within range or whisper to other players that have first whispered them), participating in in-game trades, using the Auction House and the mail feature, and several other limitations. Though this has drastically reduced the number of spamming incidents, many offenders still attempt to get attention in the more populous regions in the game, such as major cities.

==Legacy==
===Virtual community===
In addition to playing the game itself and conversing on discussion forums provided by Blizzard, ''World of Warcraft'' players often participate in the ''World of Warcraft'' [[virtual community]] in creative ways, including fan artwork<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blizzard.com/inblizz/fanart/page1.shtml|title=Blizzard fan artwork web page}}</ref> and comic strip style storytelling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/community/comics.html|title=World of Warcraft comic strip site}}</ref> Blizzard furthers this community by offering in-game and out-of-game prizes, as well as highlighting community events and occurrences. Blizzard has also provided incentives for introducing new members to ''World of Warcraft''. In late October 2005 each subscribed player received a 10-day free pass<ref>Blizzard Entertainment (2005). [http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/news/wow-news-10-2005.html World of Warcraft Community Site - Check your inbox for the Recruit-A-Friend e-mail!] Retrieved [[March 6]], [[2006]].</ref> which they suggested be employed as seasonal gifts that could either be used by the current player or given to a friend. These passes would generate a free month's usage if the guest player purchased a full account.

There are various [[memes]], including "Face Melting,"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-priest&t=296239&p=1&tmp=1#post296239|title="Face Melting" WoW forum reference}}</ref> a reference to a very long thread on the priest forums on the ''World of Warcraft'' website that consisted of players saying, "You will melt faces as a Shadow Priest in PvP" in different ways. This is because the icon for Mind Flay, a powerful skill used heavily by Shadow Priests, looks like a melting face. Another popular phenomenon in the community are [[machinima]] videos such as the one<ref>{{cite video|people=Jenkins, Leeroy (Starring)|publisher=Pals 4 Life|medium=Promotional video|title=Leeroy Jenkins|year=2005|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7714643693602998196}}</ref> starring a player named [[Leeroy Jenkins]], showing him and his guild in a comedic encounter. Leeroy's popularity inspired more videos and tributes in other games, and he was even part of a clue on the [[November 16]] [[2005]] episode of the TV [[game show]] ''[[Jeopardy!|College Jeopardy!]]''.<ref>{{cite video|year=2005|title=Jeopardy!|people=Trebek, Alex (Host)|medium=Television series||url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2448368923986986124|publisher=[[NBC]]|location=California, US}}</ref>

As of August 2005, the Dark Iron server has been home to the guilds of web-comic creators Scott Kurtz (''[[PvP]]'') and Mike Krahulik and Jerry Holkins (''[[Penny Arcade (webcomic)|Penny Arcade]]''). Kurtz created Panda Attack and Djörk on the Horde side, while Holkins and Krahulik initiated a series of guilds that is now known as the Penny Arcade Alliance. This event is referred to as the Comic Guild Wars, and has created healthy competition between the authors, to the extent of dedicating some of their strips to the subject. Tim Buckley of ''[[Ctrl+Alt+Del]]'' and the creators of ''Holy Bibble'' have also joined in on making guilds for Dark Iron players.

=== Impact on popular culture ===
{{see also|Warcraft (series)#Film adaptation}}
The popularity of ''WoW'' has led some artists to satirise and/or acknowledge its mark in popular culture. One example is the Emmy Award winning ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]."<ref name="South Park PR">{{cite press release | url = http://www.blizzard.com/press/061002.shtml | title = SOUTH PARK CELEBRATES 10 GROUNDBREAKING SEASONS!!! | date = 2006-10-02 | accessdate = 2007-07-23 | publisher = Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.}}</ref> In the Louisville [[World Series of Video Games]] competition, ''World of Warcraft'' was a featured game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewsvg.com/news/112|title=www.thewsvg.com/news/112<!--INSERT TITLE-->}}</ref> ''WoW'' itself also contains references to pop culture within the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wowwiki.com/List_of_pop_culture_references_in_Warcraft|title=Pop-culture references|accessdate = 2007-09-21|publisher=WoWWiki}}</ref>  The game has also been used to advertise unrelated products, such as [[Toyota]] trucks.<ref name="Crave">{{cite web|url=http://crave.cnet.com/8301-1_105-9792837-1.html|title=What level/class do I need to get a Tacoma in 'WoW'?|publisher=[[Cnet]]|date=[[2007-11-08]]|accessdate=2008-01-04}}</ref> In late 2007, a series of television commercials for the game began airing featuring pop culture celebrities such as [[Mr. T]], [[William Shatner]], and [[Verne Troyer]] discussing the virtues of the character classes they play in the game.

''WoW'' has inspired a [[World of Warcraft: The Board Game|board game]] produced by [[Fantasy Flight Games]], as well as a [[World of Warcraft Trading Card Game|trading card game]] produced by [[Upper Deck Entertainment]].

In November 2007, [[DC Comics]] published the first issue of the ongoing ''[[World of Warcraft (comics)|World of Warcraft]]'' comic under their [[Wildstorm Comics|Wildstorm]] [[imprint]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dccomics.com/comics/?cm=8393|title=''World of Warcraft'' #1|publisher=[[Wildstorm Comics]]}}</ref>
