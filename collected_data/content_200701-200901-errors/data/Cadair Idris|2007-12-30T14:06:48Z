'''Cadair Idris''' or '''Cader Idris''' is a [[mountain]] in [[Snowdonia]], north [[Wales]]. It lies at the southern end of [[Snowdonia National Park]] and reaches 893&nbsp;[[metre|m]] at its [[summit]], named '''Penygadair''' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]] for "top of the chair"). It is one of the most popular mountains in Wales&nbsp;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://snowdoniaguide.com/cader_idris.html |title=Cadair Idris |publisher=SnowdoniaGuide.com |accessmonthday=October 31 |accessyear=2006}}</ref>. It is composed largely of [[Ordovician]] [[igneous rock]]s, with classic [[glaciation|glacial erosion]] features such as [[Cirque|cwms]], [[moraine]]s, [[Glacial striations|striated rocks]], and [[roche moutonnée|roches moutonnées]].

A number of named paths lead to the summit, such as the ''Pony Path'', or the ''Fox's Path'', the latter leading directly up the northern face of the mountain — a three-mile-long [[cliff]] and [[scree]] face. In recent years, the Fox's Path has degraded sufficiently to make it a dangerous descent for any other than experienced hikers and [[scrambling|scramblers]]. To the north lie [[Dolgellau]] and the [[Mawddach]] estuary, while to the south is the [[glaciation|glaciated]] [[Tal-y-llyn Lake]]. Two miles further west is the eastern end of the [[Talyllyn Railway]], a [[narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] [[preserved railway]].

Much of the area around Cadair Idris was designated a [[National Nature Reserve]] in 1957, and is home to [[arctic-alpine]] plants such as [[Purple Saxifrage|purple saxifrage]] and [[Dwarf Willow|dwarf willow]]&nbsp;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unep-wcmc.org/sites/pa/0654v.htm |title=Cadair Idris National Nature Reserve |publisher=[[United Nations Environment Programme]] [[World Conservation Monitoring Centre]] |accessmonthday=October 31 |accessyear=2006}}</ref>.

==Name==

''Cadair Idris'' means "the chair of [[Idris (giant)|Idris]]" in [[Welsh language|Welsh]], a reference to a [[giant (mythology)|giant]] in [[Welsh mythology]] and the resemblance of one of the mountain's cwms, Cwm Cau, to an enormous [[chair|armchair]]. The spelling ''Cader Idris'' is often found in both Welsh and English, as reflected in the name of the local secondary school, [[Dolgellau#Education|Ysgol y Gader]] (never Ysgol y Gadair).   This spelling is presumably due to the common pronunciation in everday speech of the Welsh word ''cadair'' as {{IPA|[kader]}} (rather than {{IPA|[kadair]}}). However, ''Cadair Idris'' is the form used on modern maps and many people regard ''Cader'' as incorrect.

==Myths and legends==
[[Image:Llyn Cau.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Llyn Cau, the lake that nestles southeast of the summit. Its steep back wall may explain Cadair Idris' etymology.]]

There are numerous legends about Cadair Idris.  Some nearby lakes are supposed to be bottomless, and anyone who sleeps on its slopes will supposedly awaken either a madman or a poet. This tradition (of sleeping on the summit of the Mountain) apparently stems from bardic traditions, where bards would sleep on the mountain in hope of inspiration.{{Fact|date = July 2007}}

As mentioned above, the mountain's name refers to the giant [[Idris (giant)|Idris]] of Welsh mythology. The name is sometimes translated as ''Arthur's Seat'', presumably with reference to [[King Arthur]] (and to the [[Arthur's Seat, Edinburgh|hill of the same name in Edinburgh]]), an idea popularised by [[Susan Cooper]] in her book ''[[The Grey King]]'', part of ''The Dark is Rising'' series. There is no good reason for such a translation, however, and the connection of Idris with Arthur is highly dubious.

The crater-like shape of Cwm Cau has given rise to the occasional mistaken claim that Cadair Idris is a recently [[extinct volcano]]. This was debunked as long ago as 1872, when [[Charles Kingsley]] commented in his book ''Town Geology''&nbsp;<ref>{{Gutenberg|no=10251|name=Town Geology |author=[[Charles Kingsley]]}}</ref>:
{{cquote|I have been told, for instance, that that wonderful little blue Glas Llyn<ref>"Glas Llyn" here refers to [[Glaslyn]].</ref>, under the highest cliff of Snowdon, is the old crater of the mountain; and I have heard people insist that a similar lake, of almost equal grandeur, in the south side of Cader Idris, is a crater likewise. But the fact is not so.}}

In Welsh mythology, Cadair Idris is also said to be the hunting ground of [[Gwyn ap Nudd]] and his ''[[Cŵn Annwn]]''. The howling of these huge dogs foretold death to anyone who heard them, the pack sweeping up that person's [[soul]] and herding it into [[Annwn|the underworld]].
