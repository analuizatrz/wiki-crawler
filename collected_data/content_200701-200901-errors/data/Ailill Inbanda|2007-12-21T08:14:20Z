'''Ailill Inbanda''' mac Eógain(d.550)<ref>all dates per ''Annals of Ulster''</ref> was a king of [[Connacht]] from the [[Ui Fiachrach]] branch of the [[Connachta]]. He was the son and sucessor of [[Eógan Bél]]<ref>T.M.Charles-Edwards, ''Early Christian Ireland'' </ref> who was slain by the northern [[Ui Neill]] in 543/547. His nickname Inbanda means "womanish" or effeminate.

His father's feud with the northern Ui Neill continued. He himself was slain at the Battle of Cúil Conaire in Cera(Mayo Co.) along with his brother Áed Fortobol ("the strong") by Fergus and Domnall of the [[Cenél nEógain]], sons of [[Muirchertach mac Ercae]].
