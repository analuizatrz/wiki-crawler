==Biography==
'''DevilDriver''' is a [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band from [[California|California, United States]]. The group was started by [[Dez Fafara]], formerly of the band [[Coal Chamber]], as a result of frustrations stemming from the more mainstream direction his former band mates were attempting to take their music. After the demise of Coal Chamber, DevilDriver became his main focus. Their debut album, the self-titled [[DevilDriver (album)|DevilDriver]], was released on [[October 23]], [[2003]] under [[Roadrunner Records]]. Dez wanted to focus more on the extreme side of music, influenced by [[Black metal|black]], [[Death metal|death]], and [[thrash metal]]. This is more apparent on their second album, [[The Fury of Our Maker's Hand]], where one can hear traces of [[Scandanavian]] [[death metal]], specifically with the guitar work. 

Their latest album, ''The Fury of Our Maker's Hand'', was released in [[2005]] and was generally well-received by fans and critics alike, even garnering a 4K review from renowned rock magazine [[Kerrang]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrun.com/artists/Devildriver/showphoto.aspx?photoID=10838|title=Kerrang DevilDriver Review Scan}}</ref> 

The band went on numerous tours in support of the album, including stops in the [[USA|United States]], [[Europe]], and [[Australia]] in support of bands such as [[Fear Factory]] and [[Machine Head]], as well as the ''Burning Daylight Tour'', their first headlining.

On [[October 31]], [[2006]], DevilDriver re-released their 2005 album ''The Fury of Our Makers Hand'' with three additional studio tracks and three live recordings of previously released material. The special edition also contains a DVD of all of their music videos to date.

Just recently, DevilDriver wrapped up the recording sessions for their third album (which is set to be released on June 5, 2007) entitled [[The Last Kind Words]], at Sonic Ranch studios outside El Paso, Texas.
