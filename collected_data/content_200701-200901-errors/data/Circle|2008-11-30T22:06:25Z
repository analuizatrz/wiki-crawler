A '''circle''' is a simple [[shape]] of [[Euclidean geometry]] consisting of those [[point (geometry)|points]] in a [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] which are at a constant [[distance]], called the ''[[radius]]'', from a fixed point, called the ''center''.  A circle with center ''A'' is sometimes denoted by the symbol {{Circlenotation|A}}.

A ''[[chord (geometry)|chord]]'' of a circle is a line segment whose two endpoints lie on the circle.  A ''[[diameter]]'' is a chord passing through the center and is the largest chord in a circle. The length of a diameter is twice the length of the radius.

Circles are simple closed [[curve]]s which divide the plane into an [[interior (topology)|interior]] and an exterior.  The ''[[circumference]]'' of a circle is the perimeter of the circle, and the interior of the circle is called a ''[[Disk (mathematics)|disk]]''.  An ''[[Arc (geometry)|arc]]'' of a circle is any [[Connected space|connected]] part of a circle's perimeter.   

A circle is a special [[ellipse]] in which the two [[Focus (geometry)|foci]] are coincident.  Circles are [[conic section]]s attained when a [[conical surface|right circular cone]] is intersected with a plane perpendicular to the axis of the cone.

==History==
[[Image:God the Geometer.jpg|thumb|225px|Early [[science]], particularly [[geometry]] and [[Astrology and astronomy|astronomy/astrology]], was connected to the divine for most [[History of science in the Middle Ages|medieval scholars]]. Notice, even, the circular shape of the [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]].
The [[compass (drafting)|compass]] in this [[13th century]] manuscript is a symbol of God's act of [[Creation myth|Creation]], as many believed that there was something intrinsically "divine" or "perfect" that could be found in circles]]

The circle has been known since before the beginning of recorded history. It is the basis for the [[wheel]] which, with related inventions such as [[gear]]s, makes much of modern civilization possible. In mathematics, the study of the circle has helped inspire the development of geometry and calculus. Some highlights in the history of the circle are:
* 1700 BC – The [[Rhind papyrus]] gives a method to find the area of a circular field. The result corresponds to 256/81 as an approximate value of <math>\pi</math>.<ref>[http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Chronology/30000BC_500BC.html#1700BC Chronology for 30000 BC to 500 BC<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
* 300 BC – Book 3 of [[Euclid's Elements]] deals with the properties of circles. 
* 1880 – [[Ferdinand von Lindemann|Lindemann]] proves that <math>\pi</math> is transcendental, effectively settling the millennia-old problem of [[squaring the circle]].<ref>[http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/HistTopics/Squaring_the_circle.html Squaring the circle<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><br clear=all>

==Analytic results==
[[Image:Circle center a b radius r.svg|frame|right|Circle of radius ''r'' = 1, center (''a'', ''b'') = (1.2, -0.5).]]
[[Image:CIRCLE LINES 2.svg|right|thumb|Chord, secant, tangent, and diameter.]]
[[Image:Circle slices.svg|right|185px|Arc, sector, and segment]]
In an ''x''-''y'' [[Cartesian coordinate system]], the circle with center (''a'', ''b'') and radius ''r'' is the set of all points (''x'', ''y'') such that

:<math>
\left( x - a \right)^2 + \left( y - b \right)^2=r^2.
</math>

This '''[[equation]]''' of the circle follows from the [[Pythagorean theorem]] applied to any point on the circle. If the circle is centered at the origin (0, 0), then the equation simplifies to 

:<math>x^2 + y^2 = r^2. \!\ </math>

The equation can be written in [[parametric equations|parametric form]] using the [[trigonometric function]]s sine and cosine as

:<math>x = a+r\,\cos t,\,\!</math>
:<math>y = b+r\,\sin t\,\!</math>
where ''t'' is a [[parametric variable]], interpreted geometrically as the angle that the ray from the origin to (''x'',&nbsp;''y'') makes with the ''x''-axis.  Alternatively, in [[stereographic projection|stereographic coordinates]], the circle has a parametrization

:<math> x = a + r \frac{2t}{1+t^2}</math>
:<math> y = b + r \frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2}.</math>

In [[homogeneous coordinates]] each [[conic section]] with equation of a circle is of the form

:<math>\ ax^2+ay^2+2b_1xz+2b_2yz+cz^2 = 0.
</math>

It can be proven that a conic section is a circle if and only if the point I(1: i: 0) and J(1: −i: 0) lie on the conic section. These points are called the [[circular points at infinity]].

In [[polar coordinates]] the equation of a circle is

:<math>
r^2 - 2 r r_0 \cos(\theta - \varphi) + r_0^2 = a^2.\,
</math>

In the [[complex plane]], a circle with a center at ''c'' and radius (''r'') has the equation <math>|z-c|^2 = r^2</math>. Since <math>|z-c|^2 = z\overline{z}-\overline{c}z-c\overline{z}+c\overline{c}</math>, the slightly generalized equation <math>pz\overline{z} + gz + \overline{gz} = q</math> for real ''p'', ''q'' and complex ''g'' is sometimes called a [[generalised circle]].  Not all generalised circles are actually circles: a generalized circle is either a (true) circle or a [[line (geometry)|line]].

=== Tangent lines ===
{{main|Tangent lines to circles}}

The [[tangent line]] through a point ''P'' on a circle is perpendicular to the diameter passing through ''P''.  The equation of the tangent line to a circle of radius ''r'' centered at the origin at the point (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''y''<sub>1</sub>) is

:<math>xx_1+yy_1=r^2 \!\ </math>

Hence, the [[slope]] of a circle at (''x''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''y''<sub>1</sub>) is given by:

:<math>
\frac{dy}{dx} = - \frac{x_1}{y_1}.
</math>

More generally, the [[slope]] at a point (''x'',&nbsp;''y'') on the circle <math>(x-a)^2 +(y-b)^2 = r^2</math>, i.e., the circle centered at (''a'',&nbsp;''b'') with radius ''r'' units, is given by

:<math>
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{a-x}{y-b},
</math>

provided that <math>y \neq b</math>.

=== Pi (π) === 

{{ details|Pi}}

[[Pi]] or [[Pi|π]] is the ratio of a circle's [[circumference]] to its [[diameter]]. It is a [[mathematical constant|constant]] that takes the same numeric value for all circles.

In modern English, it is {{pronEng|ˈpaɪ}}  (the same way as the English word pie).

=== Area enclosed ===

[[Image:Circle Area.svg|thumb|150px|Area of the circle = '''''π''''' × area of the shaded square]]

{{main|Area of a disk}}

The [[Area of a disk|area enclosed by a circle]] is <math>\pi</math> multiplied by the radius squared:

:<math>
 Area = \pi r^2\, </math>

Equivalently, denoting diameter by ''d'',

:<math>Area = \frac{\pi d^2}{4} \approx 0{.}7854 \cdot d^2, </math>

that is, approximately 79% of the [[Circumscribe|circumscribing]] square (whose side is of length ''d'').

The circle is the plane curve enclosing the maximum area for a given arc length.  This relates the circle to a problem in the [[calculus of variations]], namely the [[isoperimetric inequality]].

==Properties==

*The circle is the shape with the largest area for a given length of perimeter. (See [[Isoperimetric inequality]].)
*The circle is a highly symmetric shape: every line through the center forms a line of [[reflection symmetry]] and it has [[rotational symmetry]] around the center for every angle. Its [[symmetry group]] is the [[orthogonal group]] O(2,'''R'''). The group of rotations alone is the [[circle group]] '''T'''.
*All circles are [[similarity (mathematics)|similar]].
**A circle's circumference and radius are [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]]. 
**The [[area (geometry)|area]] enclosed and the square of its radius are [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]]. 
***The [[mathematical constant|constants]] of proportionality are 2[[pi|π]] and π, respectively.
*The circle centered at the origin with radius 1 is called the [[unit circle]].
**Thought of as a [[great circle]] of the [[unit sphere]], it becomes the [[Riemannian circle]].
*Through any three points, not all on the same line, there lies a unique circle.  In [[Cartesian coordinates]], it is possible to give explicit formulae for the coordinates of the center of the circle and the radius in terms of the coordinates of the three given points. See [[circumcircle]].

=== Chord properties ===
* Chords are equidistant from the center of a circle if and only if they are equal in length. 
* The perpendicular bisector of a chord passes through the center of a circle; equivalent statements stemming from the uniqueness of the perpendicular bisector: 
** A perpendicular line from the center of a circle bisects the chord. 
** The [[line segment]] ([[circular segment]]) through the center bisecting a chord is perpendicular to the chord. 
* If a central angle and an [[inscribed angle]] of a circle are subtended by the same chord and on the same side of the chord, then the central angle is twice the inscribed angle. 
* If two angles are inscribed on the same chord and on the same side of the chord, then they are equal. 
* If two angles are inscribed on the same chord and on opposite sides of the chord, then they are supplemental.
** For a cyclic quadrilateral, the exterior angle is equal to the interior opposite angle.
* An inscribed angle subtended by a diameter is a right angle.
* The diameter is the longest chord of the circle.

===Sagitta properties===
*  The sagitta (also know as the [[versine]]) is a line segment drawn perpendicular to a chord, between the midpoint of that chord and the circumference of the circle.
*  Given the length ''y'' of a chord, and the length ''x'' of the sagitta, the [[Pythagorean theorem]] can be used to calculate the radius of the unique circle which will fit around the two lines:

:: <math>r=\frac{y^2}{8x}+ \frac{x}{2}.</math>

Another proof of this result which relies only on two chord properties given above is as follows.  Given a chord of length ''y'' and with sagitta of length ''x'', since the sagitta intersects the midpoint of the chord, we know it is part of a diameter of the circle.  Since the diameter is twice the radius, the “missing” part of the diameter is (2''r''&nbsp;−&nbsp;''x'') in length.  Using the fact that one part of one chord times the other part is equal to the same product taken along a chord intersecting the first chord, we find that (2''r''&nbsp;−&nbsp;''x'')''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;(''y''/2)².  Solving for ''r'', we find the required result.

===Tangent properties===
*The line drawn perpendicular a radius through the end point of the radius is a tangent to the circle. 
*A line drawn perpendicular to a tangent through the point of contact with a circle passes through the center of the circle. 
*Two tangents can always be drawn to a circle from any point outside the circle, and these tangents are equal in length.

===Theorems===
[[Image:Secant-Secant Theorem.svg|thumb|200px|right|Secant-secant theorem]]
{{See also|Power of a point}}
*The chord theorem states that if two chords, ''CD'' and ''EB'', intersect at ''A'', then ''CA''&times;''DA'' = ''EA''&times;''BA''. 
*If a [[tangent]] from an external point ''D'' meets the circle at ''C'' and a [[Secant line|secant]] from the external point ''D'' meets the circle at ''G'' and ''E'' respectively, then ''DC''<sup>2</sup> = ''DG''&times;''DE''. (Tangent-secant theorem.) 
*If two secants, ''DG'' and ''DE'', also cut the circle at ''H'' and ''F'' respectively, then ''DH''&times;''DG'' = ''DF''&times;''DE''. (Corollary of the tangent-secant theorem.) 
*The angle between a tangent and chord is equal to the subtended angle on the opposite side of the chord. (Tangent chord property.)
*If the angle subtended by the chord at the center is 90 [[Degree (angle)|degrees]] then ''l'' = √2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;''r'', where ''l'' is the length of the chord and ''r'' is the radius of the circle.
*If two secants are inscribed in the circle as shown at right, then the measurement of angle ''A'' is equal to one half the difference of the measurements of the enclosed arcs (''DE'' and ''BC''). This is the secant-secant theorem.

===Inscribed angles===

[[Image:inscribed angle theorem.svg|thumb|242px|right|Inscribed angle theorem]]

An [[inscribed angle]] (examples are the blue and green angles in the figure) is exactly half the corresponding [[central angle]] (red). Hence, all inscribed angles that subtend the same arc (pink) are equal. Angles inscribed on the arc (brown) are supplementary. In particular, every inscribed angle that subtends a [[diameter]] is a [[right angle]] (since the central angle is 180 degrees).

==Apollonius circle==<!-- This section is linked from [[Sphere]] -->

[[Image:Apollonius circle definition labels.svg|thumb|200px|left|Apollonius' definition of a circle: ''d''<sub>1</sub>/''d''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;constant.]]

[[Apollonius of Perga]] showed that a circle may also be defined as the set of points in plane having a constant ''ratio'' of distances to two fixed foci, A and B.  That circle is sometimes said to be drawn ''about'' two points<ref>{{cite book|author=Harkness, James|title=Introduction to the theory of analytic functions|location=London, New York|publisher=Macmillan and Co.| year= 1898 |pages= 30|url=http://dlxs2.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=math;idno=01680002}}</ref>.

The proof is as follows.  A line segment PC bisects the interior angle APB, since the segments are similar:

:<math>
\frac{AP}{BP} = \frac{AC}{BC}.
</math>

Analogously, a line segment PD bisects the corresponding exterior angle.  Since the interior and exterior angles sum to <math>180^{\circ}</math>, the angle CPD is exactly <math>90^{\circ}</math>, i.e., a [[right angle]].   The set of points P that form a right angle with a given line segment CD form a circle, of which CD is the diameter.
{{-}}
===Cross-ratios===
A closely related property of circles involves the geometry of the [[cross-ratio]] of points in the [[complex plane]].  If ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' are as above, then the Apollonius circle for these three points is the collection of points ''P'' for which the absolute value of the cross-ratio is equal to one:
:<math>|[A,B;C,P]| = 1.</math>
Stated another way, ''P'' is a point on the Apollonius circle if and only if the cross-ratio [''A'',''B'';''C'',''P''] is on the [[unit circle]] in the complex plane.

===Generalized circles===
{{See also|Generalized circle}}
If ''C'' is the [[midpoint]] of the segment ''AB'', then the collection of points ''P'' satisfying the Apollonius condition

:<math>\frac{|AP|}{|BP|} = \frac{|AC|}{|BC|}</math>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)

is not a circle, but rather a line.

Thus, if ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' are given distinct points in the plane, then the locus of points ''P'' satisfying (1) is called a '''generalized circle'''.  It may either be a true circle or a line. In this sense a [[line (geometry)|line]] is generalized circle of infinite radius.
