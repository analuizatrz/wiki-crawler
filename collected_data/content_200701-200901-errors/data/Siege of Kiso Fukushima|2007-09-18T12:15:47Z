The [[1554]] '''siege of Kiso-Fukushima''' was a siege by [[Takeda Shingen]] on [[Kiso Fukushima castle]], in the [[Kiso River]] Valley of [[Shinano province]]. This was one of many battles fought during Shingen's campaign to seize control of Shinano.

[[Kiso Yoshiyasu]], commander of the besieged castle, surrendered as his garrison ran out of food and water, as a result of Shingen's starvation siege tactics.
