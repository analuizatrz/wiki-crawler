The '''durian''' ({{IPA2|ˈdʊəriən, -ɑn}}<ref>{{ cite web | title = Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1) | publisher = Random House, Inc. | year = 2008 | accessdate = 2008-04-02 | url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/durian }}</ref>) is the [[fruit]] of trees of the [[genus]] ''Durio'' belonging to the [[Malvaceae]], a large family which includes [[hibiscus]], [[okra]], [[cotton]], [[mallows]] and [[Tilia|linden]] trees. Widely known and revered in [[Southeast Asia]] as the "King of Fruits," the fruit is distinctive for its large size, unique [[odor|odour]], and formidable thorn-covered [[husk]]. The fruit can grow up to {{convert|30|cm|in}} long and {{convert|15|cm|in|0}} in diameter, and typically weighs one to three kilograms (2 to 7&nbsp;lbs). Its shape ranges from oblong to round, the colour of its husk green to brown, and its flesh pale-yellow to red, depending on the species. 

The hard outer husk is covered with sharp, prickly [[Spine (botany)|thorns]] while the edible flesh within emits a distinctive odour, which is regarded as either fragrant or overpowering and offensive. The odour of the ripe fruit is strong and penetrating even when the husk is intact. Due to the unusual odour, the durian is forbidden from certain establishments such as hotels and public transportations in Southeast Asia. The odour has prompted many people to formulate evocative descriptions with views ranging from those of deep appreciation to intense disgust.

The durian, native to [[Brunei]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]], has only been known to the western world for about 600 years. The British [[Natural history|naturalist]] [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] famously described its flesh as "a rich custard highly flavoured with almonds" in the 19th century. The flesh can be consumed at various stages of ripeness and is used to flavour a wide variety of savoury and sweet edibles in Southeast Asian cuisines. The seeds can also be eaten when cooked. The name ''durian'' comes from the [[Malay language|Malay]] word ''duri'' (thorn) together with the [[suffix]] -''an''.

There are 30 recognised ''Durio'' species, at least nine of which produce edible fruit. ''Durio zibethinus'' is the only species available in the international market; other species are sold in their local regions. There are hundreds of durian [[cultivar]]s; most of them have a common name and a code number starting with "D". Many consumers express preferences for specific cultivars, which fetch higher prices in the market.

==Species==
{{dablink|For the complete list of known species of Durio, see [[List of Durio species]].}}
[[Image:Durian tree in malaysia.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Durian tree, compared to human height]] 
Durian [[tree]]s are relatively large, growing to 25&ndash;50&nbsp;metres (80&ndash;165&nbsp;ft) in height depending on the species.<ref name=Brown/> The leaves are [[evergreen]], elliptic to oblong and 10&ndash;18&nbsp;centimetres (4&ndash;7&nbsp;in) long. The flowers are produced in three to thirty clusters together on large branches and directly on the trunk with each flower having a calyx ([[sepals]]) and five (rarely four or six) [[petal]]s. Durian trees have one or two flowering and fruiting periods per year, though the timing varies depending on the species, cultivars, and localities. A typical durian tree can bear fruit after four or five years. The durian fruit can hang from any branch and matures roughly three months after [[pollination]]. The durian fruit can grow up to {{convert|30|cm|in}} long and {{convert|15|cm|in|0}} in diameter, and typically weighs one to three kilograms (2 to 7&nbsp;lb).<ref name=Brown/> Its shape ranges from oblong to round, the colour of its husk green to brown, and its flesh pale-yellow to red, depending on the species.<ref name=Brown/> Among the thirty known species of ''Durio'', nine of them have been identified as producing edible fruits: ''D. zibethinus'', ''D. dulcis'', ''D. grandiflorus'', ''D. graveolens'', ''[[Durio kutejensis|D. kutejensis]]'', ''D. lowianus'', ''D. macrantha'', ''D. oxleyanus'' and ''D. testudinarum''.<ref name=ACIAR>{{cite web | url = http://www.cababstractsplus.org/google/abstract.asp?AcNo=20053008325| title = Botany and Production of Durian (''Durio zibethinus'') in Southeast Asia | year = 2004 | accessdate = 2006-03-05 | format = PDF |author = O'Gara, E., Guest, D.

[[Image:Durian flower.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Durian flowers are usually closed during the daytime.]]
The name ''durian'' comes from the [[Malay language|Malay]] word ''duri'' (thorn) together with the [[suffix]] -''an'' (for building a noun in Malay).<ref>{{cite book | quote=Via ''durion'', the Malay name for the plant. | title = [[Oxford English Dictionary]] | year = 1897 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | author=Huxley, A. (Ed.) | title=New RHS Dictionary of Gardening | publisher=Macmillan | year=1992 | id=ISBN 1-56159-001-0}}</ref> ''D. zibethinus'' is the only species commercially cultivated on a large scale and available outside of its native region. Since this species is open-pollinated, it shows considerable diversity in fruit colour and odour, size of flesh and seed, and tree [[phenology]]. In the species name, ''zibethinus'' refers to the Indian [[civet]], ''Viverra zibetha''. There is disagreement regarding whether this name, bestowed by [[Carolus Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], refers to civets being so fond of the durian that the fruit was used as bait to entrap them, or to the durian smelling like the civet.<ref>{{cite book | author = Brown, Michael J. | title=Durio &mdash; A Bibliographic Review | publisher = International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI)| year=1997 | url = http://www.bioversityinternational.org/publications/Pdf/654.pdf | isbn=92-9043-318-3 | pages = p. 2; also, see pp. 5&ndash;6 regarding whether Linnaeus or Murray is the correct authority for the [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial name]] | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-03-14}}</ref>

Durian flowers are large and feathery with copious [[nectar (plant)|nectar]], and give off a heavy, sour and buttery odour. These features are typical of flowers pollinated by certain species of [[bat]]s that eat nectar and [[pollen]].<ref>{{cite book | author=Whitten, Tony | title=The Ecology of Sumatra | publisher=Periplus | year=2001 | id=ISBN 962-593-074-4 | pages=p. 329}}</ref> According to research conducted in Malaysia in the 1970s, durians were pollinated almost exclusively by cave fruit bats (''[[Eonycteris|Eonycteris spelaea]]'').<ref name=Brown/> However, a 1996 study indicated two species, ''D. grandiflorus'' and ''D. oblongus'', were pollinated by [[spiderhunter]]s ([[Nectariniidae]]) and another species, ''D. kutejensis'', was pollinated by giant honey bees and birds as well as bats.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Bird-pollination of Three Durio Species (Bombacaceae) in a Tropical Rainforest in Sarawak, Malaysia | author = Yumoto, Takakazu | journal = [[American Journal of Botany]] | volume = 87 | issue = 8 |pages = p. 1181–1188 | year = 2000 }}</ref>

===Cultivars===
[[Image:D101 and random stock.jpg|thumb|right|Different cultivars of durian often have distinct colours. D101 (right) has rich yellow flesh, clearly distinguishable from a random variety (left).]]

Over the centuries, numerous durian [[cultivar]]s propagated by vegetative [[Cloning|clone]]s have arisen in southeast Asia. They used to be grown with mixed results from seeds of trees bearing superior quality fruit, but are now propagated by [[layering]], [[marcotting]], or more commonly, by [[grafting]], including bud, [[Wood veneer|veneer]], wedge, whip or U-grafting onto seedlings of randomly selected [[rootstock]]s. Different cultivars can be distinguished to some extent by variations in the fruit shape, such as the shape of the spines.<ref name=Brown/> Durian consumers express preferences for specific cultivars, which fetch higher prices in the market.<ref name=ST/>

Most cultivars have a common name and a code number starting with "D". For example, some popular clones are Kop (D99), Chanee (D123, {{lang-th|ชะนี}}, [[IPA|ʨʰániː]]), Tuan Mek Hijau (D145), Kan Yao (D158, {{lang-th|ก้านยาว}}, [[IPA|kâːn jaːw]]), Mon Thong (D159, {{lang-th|หมอนทอง}}, [[IPA|mɔ̌ːn tʰɔːŋ]]), Kradum Thong ([[IPA|kràdum tʰɔːŋ]]), and with no common name, D24. Each cultivar has a distinct taste and odour. More than 200 cultivars of ''D. zibethinus'' exist in [[Thailand]]. Chanee is the most preferred rootstock due to its resistance to infection by ''[[Phytophthora palmivora]]''. Among all the cultivars in Thailand, only four are currently in large-scale commercial cultivation: Chanee, Kradum Thong, Mon Thong, and Kan Yao.<ref name=Brown/> There are more than 100 registered cultivars in [[Malaysia]]<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~durian/info/vk_duri.htm | title = Comprehensive List of Durian Clones Registered by the Agriculture Department (of Malaysia)| publisher = Durian OnLine | accessdate=2006-03-05|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070407225917/http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~durian/info/vk_duri.htm 
|archivedate=2007-04-07}}</ref> and many superior cultivars have been identified through competitions held at the annual Malaysian Agriculture, Horticulture and Agrotourism Show. In [[Vietnam]], the same process has been done through competitions held by the Southern Fruit Research Institute.

In recent times, Songpol Somsri, a Thai government scientist, crossbred more than ninety varieties of durian to create Chantaburi No. 1, a cultivar without the characteristic odour, which is awaiting final approval from the local Ministry of Agriculture.<ref name="Fuller">{{cite web | author=Fuller, Thomas | date = [[2007-04-08]] | title = Fans Sour on Sweeter Version of Asia's Smelliest Fruit | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/08/world/asia/08durian.html?ex=1333684800&en=bc818fd0f3339f36&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss | work =[[New York Times]] | accessdate= 2007-04-08}}</ref> Another hybrid, Chantaburi No. 3, develops the odour about three days after the fruit is picked, which enables an odourless transport and satisfies consumers who prefer the pungent odour.<ref name="Fuller"/>

==Cultivation and availability==
[[Image:Pekawai 070314 0221 utk.jpg|thumb|left|''Durio kutejensis'' from [[West Kalimantan]], Indonesia]]

The durian is native to [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Brunei]]. There is some debate as to whether the durian is native to the [[Philippines]], or was introduced.<ref name=Brown/> The durian is grown in other areas with a similar climate; it is strictly [[Tropical agriculture|tropical]] and stops growing when mean daily temperatures drop below {{convert|22|C|F}}.<ref name=ACIAR/> 

The centre of [[ecological diversity]] for durians is the island of [[Borneo]], where the fruit of the edible species of ''Durio'' including ''D. zibethinus'', ''D. dulcis'', ''D. graveolens'', ''D. kutejensis'', ''D. oxleyanus'' and ''D. testudinarium'' are sold in local markets. In Brunei, ''D. zibethinus'' is not grown because consumers prefer other species such as ''D. graveolens'', ''D. kutejensis'' and ''D. oxyleyanus''. These species are commonly distributed in Brunei and together with other species like ''D. testudinarium'' and ''D. dulcis'', represent rich [[genetic diversity]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ipgri.cgiar.org/Publications/HTMLPublications/655/ch08.htm | title = Tropical fruit production and genetic resources in Southeast Asia: Identifying the priority fruit species | author = M.B.

Although the durian is not native to [[Thailand]], the country is currently one of the major exporters of durians, growing {{convert|781000|t|lk=on}} of the world's total harvest of {{convert|1400000|t}} in 1999, exporting {{convert|111000|t}}.<ref name=trade/> Malaysia and Indonesia followed, both producing about {{convert|265000|t}} each. Malaysia exported {{convert|35000|t}} in 1999.<ref name=trade/> In the Philippines, the centre of durian production is the [[Davao Region]]. 
The [[Kadayawan Festival]] is an annual celebration featuring the durian in [[Davao City]]. Other places where durians are grown include [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Vietnam]], [[Myanmar]], [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[West Indies]], [[Florida]], [[Hawaii]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Polynesia|Polynesian Islands]], [[Madagascar]], southern China (Hainan Island), [[northern Australia]], and [[Pulau Ubin]] island in [[Singapore]]. 

Durian was introduced into Australia in the early 1960s and clonal material was first introduced in 1975. Over thirty clones of ''D. zibethinus'' and six ''Durio'' species have been subsequently introduced into Australia.<ref>{{ cite journal | author = Watson, B.

[[Image:Durianpack01.JPG|thumb|left|Durian flesh packed for sale, with an exposed seed]]
The durian is a seasonal fruit, unlike some other non-seasonal tropical fruits such as the [[papaya]] which are available throughout the year. In Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore, the season for durians is typically from June to August, which coincides with that of the [[mangosteen]].<ref name=Brown/> Prices of durians are relatively high as compared with other fruits. For example, in Singapore, the strong demand for high quality cultivars such as the D24, ''Sultan'', and ''Mao Shan Wang'' has resulted in typical retail prices of between [[S$]]8 to S$15 ([[US$]]5 to US$10) per kilogram of whole fruit.<ref name=ST>{{cite web | url = http://www.stomp.com.sg/stfoodiesclub/taste/03/index.html | title = ST Foodies Club - Durian King | year = 2006 | accessdate = 2007-07-25 | publisher = [[The Straits Times]] }}</ref> With an average weight of about {{convert|1.5|kg}}, a durian fruit would therefore set the consumer back by about S$12 to S$22 (US$8 to US$15).<ref name=ST/> The edible portion of the fruit, known as the [[aril]] (usually referred to as the "flesh" or "pulp") only accounts for about 15-30% of the mass of the entire fruit.<ref name=Brown>{{cite book | author=Brown, Michael J. | title=Durio &mdash; A Bibliographic Review | publisher=International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI), at p35 | year=1997 | url = http://www.bioversityinternational.org/publications/Pdf/654.pdf | format = PDF | isbn=92-9043-318-3 | accessdate = 2007-03-14}}</ref> Many consumers in Singapore are nevertheless quite willing to spend up to around S$75 (US$50) in a single purchase of about half a dozen of the favoured fruit to be shared by family members.<ref name=ST/>

In season durians can be found in mainstream [[Japan]]ese supermarkets while, in the West, they are sold mainly by Asian markets.

==Flavour and odour==
[[Image:Singapore MRT Fines.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Sign forbidding durians on Singapore's [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|Mass Rapid Transit]]]]

The unusual flavour and odour of the fruit have prompted many people to express diverse and passionate views ranging from deep appreciation to intense disgust. Writing in 1856, the British [[Natural history|naturalist]] [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] provides a much-quoted description of the flavour of the durian: 

{{cquote| The five cells are silky-white within, and are filled with a mass of firm, cream-coloured pulp, containing about three seeds each. This pulp is the edible part, and its consistence and flavour are indescribable. A rich custard highly flavoured with almonds gives the best general idea of it, but there are occasional wafts of flavour that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine, and other incongruous dishes. Then there is a rich glutinous smoothness in the pulp which nothing else possesses, but which adds to its delicacy. It is neither acid nor sweet nor juicy; yet it wants neither of these qualities, for it is in itself perfect. It produces no nausea or other bad effect, and the more you eat of it the less you feel inclined to stop. In fact, to eat Durians is a new sensation worth a voyage to the East to experience. ... as producing a food of the most exquisite flavour it is unsurpassed.<ref name=Wallace>{{cite web | author = [[Alfred Russel Wallace|Wallace, Alfred Russel]] | title = On the Bamboo and Durian of Borneo | date = 1856 | url = http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/S027.htm | accessdate = 2007-03-12}}</ref>}}

While Wallace cautions that "the smell of the ripe fruit is certainly at first disagreeable", later descriptions by westerners are more graphic. British novelist [[Anthony Burgess]] writes that eating durian is "like eating sweet raspberry [[blancmange]] in the lavatory."<ref>{{cite book | title = The Long Day Wanes: A Malayan Trilogy | first = Anthony |last = Burgess | authorlink = Anthony Burgess | pages = p. 68 | publisher = W. W. Norton & Company | isbn = 0393309436 | year = 1993, first printed in 1956 }}</ref> Chef [[Andrew Zimmern]] compares the taste to "completely rotten, mushy onions."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8M7vn8bkmg | title = Bizarre Foods - Asia | accessdate = 2008-03-22 | publisher = YouTube }}</ref> Travel and food writer [[Richard Sterling]] says:  
{{cquote|... its odor is best described as pig-shit, turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.  It can be smelled from yards away.  Despite its great local popularity, the raw fruit is forbidden from some establishments such as hotels, subways and airports, including public transportation in Southeast Asia.<ref>{{cite book | author=Winokur, Jon (Ed.) | title=The Traveling Curmudgeon: Irreverent Notes, Quotes, and Anecdotes on Dismal Destinations, Excess Baggage, the Full Upright Position, and Other Reasons Not to Go There | publisher=Sasquatch Books | year=2003 | id=ISBN 1-57061-389-3 | pages = p. 102}}</ref>}} [[Image:Hydrogen-sulfide-2D-dimensions.svg|thumb|left|[[Hydrogen sulfide]], one of the chemical compounds that may be responsible for the characteristic odour of durian]]

The wide range of descriptions for the odour of durian may have a great deal to do with the variability of durian odour itself. Durians from different species or clones can have significantly different aromas; for example, red durian (''D. dulcis'') has a deep [[caramel]] flavour with a [[turpentine]] odour while red-fleshed durian (''D. graveolens'') emits a fragrance of roasted [[almond]]s.<ref name=ACIAR2>{{cite web | url = http://www.cababstractsplus.org/google/abstract.asp?AcNo=20053008326| title = Occurrence, Distribution and Utilisation of Durian Germplasm | year = 2004 | accessdate = 2007-03-13 | format = PDF |author = O'Gara, E., Guest, D. I. and Hassan, N. M. | publisher = Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) }}</ref> Among the varieties of ''D. zibethinus'', Thai varieties are sweeter in flavour and less odourous than Malay ones.<ref name=Brown/> The degree of ripeness has an effect on the flavour as well.<ref name=Brown/> Three scientific analyses of the composition of durian aroma &mdash; from 1972, 1980, and 1995 &mdash; each found a mix of volatile compounds including [[ester]]s, [[ketone]]s, and different [[sulfur compounds]], with no agreement on which may be primarily responsible for the distinctive odour.<ref name=Brown/> 

This strong odour can be detected half a mile away by animals, thus luring them. In addition, the fruit is extremely appetising to a variety of animals from [[squirrel]]s to [[Chevrotain|mouse deer]], [[pig]]s, [[orangutan]], [[elephant]]s, and even carnivorous [[tiger]]s. While some of these animals eat the fruit and dispose of the seed under the parent plant, others swallow the seed with the fruit and then transport it some distance before excreting, with the seed being dispersed as the result.<ref>{{cite book | author=Marinelli, Janet (Ed.) | title=Brooklyn Botanic Garden Gardener's Desk Reference | publisher=Henry Holt and Co. | year=1998 | id=ISBN 0-8050-5095-7 | pages = p. 691 }}</ref> The thorny, armoured covering of the fruit discourages smaller animals; larger animals are more likely to transport the seeds far from the parent tree.<ref name=McGee>{{cite book | author = [[Harold McGee|McGee, Harold]] | title= On Food and Cooking (Revised Edition) | publisher=Scribner | year=2004 | id=ISBN 0-684-80001-2 | pages = p. 379}}</ref>

===Ripeness and selection===
[[Image:Durian customer.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A customer sniffs durian before purchasing it.]]

According to ''[[Larousse Gastronomique]]'', the durian fruit is ready to eat when its husk begins to crack.<ref>{{cite book | title = [[Larousse Gastronomique]] | author = Montagne, Prosper (Ed.) | publisher = Clarkson Potter | year = 2001 | isbn = 0609609718 | pages = p. 439}}</ref> However, the ideal stage of ripeness to be enjoyed varies from region to region in Southeast Asia and by species. Some species grow so tall that they can only be collected once they have fallen to the ground, whereas most cultivars of ''D. zibethinus'' are nearly always cut from the tree and allowed to ripen while waiting to be sold. Some people in [[southern Thailand]] prefer their durians relatively young when the clusters of fruit within the shell are still crisp in texture and mild in flavour. In [[northern Thailand]], the preference is for the fruit to be as soft and pungent in aroma as possible. In Malaysia and Singapore, most consumers prefer the fruit to be quite ripe and may even risk allowing the fruit to continue ripening after its husk has already cracked open. In this state, the flesh becomes richly creamy, slightly alcoholic,<ref name=Davidson/> the aroma pronounced and the flavour highly complex.

The various preferences regarding ripeness among consumers makes it hard to issue general statements about choosing a "good" durian. A durian that falls off the tree continues to ripen for two to four days, but after five or six days most would consider it overripe and unpalatable.<ref name=Morton>{{cite book | author=Morton, J. F. | url = http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/morton/durian_ars.html | title=Fruits of Warm Climates | publisher=Florida Flair Books | year=1987 | id=ISBN 0-9610184-1-0}}</ref> The usual advice for a durian consumer choosing a whole fruit in the market is to examine the quality of the [[plant stem|stem]] or stalk which loses moisture as it ages: a big, solid stem is a sign of freshness.<ref name=tech>{{cite web | url = http://www.proscitech.com.au/trop/d.htm | title = Durian & Mangosteens | publisher = Prositech.com | accessdate = 2006-07-01 }}</ref> Reportedly, unscrupulous merchants wrap, paint, or remove the stalks altogether. Another frequent piece of advice is to shake the fruit and listen for the sound of the seeds moving within, indicating the durian is very ripe and the pulp has dried out a bit.<ref name=tech/>

==History==
[[Image:Garcia-orta-coloquios.png|upright|left|thumb|''Colóquios dos Simples e Drogas da India'' (1563)]]

The durian has been known and consumed in southeastern Asia since [[Prehistory|prehistoric times]], but has only been known to the western world for about 600 years. The earliest known European reference to the durian is the record of [[Niccolò Da Conti|Niccolò de' Conti]], who travelled to southeastern Asia in the fifteenth century.<ref name=Brown/> [[Garcia de Orta]] described durians in ''[[Colóquios dos Simples e Drogas da India]]'' published in 1563. In 1741, ''Herbarium Amboinense'' by the German botanist [[Georg Eberhard Rumphius]] was published, providing the most detailed and accurate account of durians for over a century. The genus ''Durio'' has a complex [[taxonomy]] that has seen the subtraction and addition of many species since it was created by Rumphius.<ref name=ACIAR/> During the early stages of its taxonomical study, there was some confusion between durian and the [[soursop]] (''Annona muricata''), for both of these species had thorny green fruit.<ref name=Brown/> It is also interesting to note the Malay name for the soursop is ''durian Belanda'', meaning ''Dutch durian''.<ref>{{cite book | author=Davidson, Alan | title=The Oxford Companion to Food | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1999 | id=ISBN 0-19-211579-0 | pages= p. 737}}</ref> In the eighteenth century, [[Johann Anton Weinmann]] considered the durian to belong to [[Chestnut|Castaneae]] as its fruit was similar to the horse chestnut.

[[Image:Durio Zibethinus Van Nooten.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''Durio zibethinus''. [[Chromolithograph]] by Hoola Van Nooten, circa 1863]]
''D. zibethinus'' was introduced into [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]] by the Portuguese in the sixteenth century and was reintroduced many times later. It has been planted in the Americas but confined to [[botanical garden]]s. The first seedlings were sent from the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]], to [[Auguste Saint-Arromen]] of [[Dominica]] in 1884.<ref name = Agro>{{ cite web | url = http://www.worldagroforestry.org/SEA/Products/AFDbases/AF/asp/SpeciesInfo.asp?SpID=715 | title = Agroforestry Tree Database - ''Durio zibethinus'' | publisher = International Center for Research in Agroforestry | accessdate = 2007-03-12}}</ref> 

In southeast Asia the durian has been cultivated for centuries at the village level, probably since the late eighteenth century, and commercially in south-eastern Asia since the mid-twentieth century.<ref name=Brown/> In ''My Tropic Isle'', [[Edmund James Banfield|E. J. Banfield]] tells how, in the early 20th century, a friend in [[Singapore]] sent him a durian seed, which he planted and cared for on his tropical island off the north coast of [[Queensland]].<ref>{{cite book | author=[[Edmund James Banfield|Banfield, E. J.]], | title=My Tropic Isle | url = http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/b/banfield/ej/b21tr/ | publisher=T. Fisher Unwin | year=1911 | accessdate = 2007-03-14}}</ref> 

In 1949, the British botanist [[E. J. H. Corner]] published ''The Durian Theory, or the Origin of the Modern Tree''. His idea was that ''endozoochory'' (the enticement of animals to transport seeds in their stomach) arose before any other method of [[Biological dispersal|seed dispersal]], and that primitive ancestors of Durio species were the earliest practitioners of that strategy, especially the red durian fruit exemplifying the primitive fruit of flowering plants.

Since the early 1990s, the domestic and international demand for durian in the Association of South-East Asian Nations ([[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]]) region has increased dramatically, partly due to the increasing affluence in Asia.<ref name=Brown/>

==Uses==
===Culinary===
[[Image:Durianlog.JPG|thumb|left|A durian-flavoured [[Bûche de Noël|Yule log]]]]
Durian fruit is used to flavour a wide variety of sweet edibles such as traditional Malay candy, [[ice kachang]], [[dodol]], rose biscuits, and, with a touch of modern innovation, ice cream, milkshakes, [[mooncake]]s, [[Yule log]]s and [[cappuccino]]. Pulut Durian is [[glutinous rice]] steamed with [[coconut milk]] and served with ripened durian. In [[Sabah]], red durian is fried with onions and chilli and served as a side dish.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sabahtravelguide.com/culture/default.ASP?page=trad_cuisine | publisher = Sabah Tourism Promotion Corporation | title = Traditional Cuisine | accessdate = 2007-03-10 }}</ref> Red-fleshed durian is traditionally added to ''sayur'', an Indonesian soup made from fresh water fish.<ref name=Heaton>{{cite book | title = A Consumers Guide on World Fruit | author = Heaton, Donald D. | publisher = BookSurge Publishing | isbn = 1419639552 | year = 2006 | pages= p. 54–56 }}</ref> ''Ikan brengkes'' is fish cooked in a durian-based sauce, traditional in [[Sumatra]].<ref>{{cite book | title = Indonesia (Lonely Planet Travel Guides) | first = Justine |last = Vaisutis | coauthors = Neal Bedford, Mark Elliott, Nick Ray, Ryan Ver Berkmoes | pages = p. 83 | publisher = Lonely Planet Publications | isbn = 1741044359 | year = 2007}}</ref> ''Tempoyak'' refers to [[Fermentation (food)|fermented]] durian, usually made from lower quality durian that is unsuitable for direct consumption.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~durian/rec/recipe.htm | title = Durian Recipe Gallery | publisher = Durian Online| accessdate = 2006-03-03| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070822090320/http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~durian/rec/recipe.htm  | archivedate=2007-08-22}}</ref> Tempoyak can be eaten either cooked or uncooked, is normally eaten with rice, and can also be used for making [[curry]].

In Thailand, blocks of durian paste are sold in the markets, though much of the paste is [[Adulterant|adulterated]] with [[pumpkin]].<ref name=Morton/> Unripe durians may be cooked as vegetable, except in the Philippines, where all uses are sweet rather than savoury. Malaysians make both sugared and salted preserves from durian. When durian is minced with salt, onions and vinegar, it is called ''boder''. The durian seeds, which are the size of chestnuts, can be eaten whether they are boiled, roasted or fried in [[coconut oil]], with a texture that is similar to [[taro]] or [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]], but stickier. In Java, the seeds are sliced thin and cooked with sugar as a confectionery. Uncooked durian seeds are toxic due to [[cyclopropene]] [[fatty acid]]s and should not be ingested.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.science.edu.sg/ssc/detailed.jsp?artid=3452&type=6&root=4&parent=4&cat=49 | publisher = Singapore Science Centre | title = Question No. 18085: Is it true that durian seeds are poisonous? | accessdate = 2006-03-20 | date = 2006}}</ref> Young leaves and [[shoot]]s of the durian are occasionally cooked as [[greens (vegetable)|greens]].

In Malaysia, a [[decoction]] of the leaves and roots used to be prescribed as an [[antipyretic]]. The leaf juice is applied on the head of a fever patient.<ref name=Morton/> The most complete description of the medicinal use of the durian as remedies for fevers is a Malay prescription, collected by Burkill and Haniff in 1930. It instructs the reader to boil the roots of ''[[Hibiscus rosa-sinensis]]'' with the roots of ''Durio zibethinus'', ''[[Nephelium|Nephelium longan]]'', ''Nephelium mutabile'' and ''[[Artocarpus|Artocarpus integrifolia]]'', and drink the decoction or use it as a [[poultice]].<ref>{{ cite journal | author = Burkill, I.H. and Haniff, M. | year = 1930 | title = Malay village medicine, prescriptions collected | journal = Gardens Bulletin Straits Settlements | issue = 6 | pages = p. 176–177 }}</ref>

In the 1920s, Durian Fruit Products, Inc., of New York City launched a product called "Dur-India" as a health food supplement, selling at [[US$]]9 for a dozen bottles, each containing 63 tablets. The tablets allegedly contained durian and a species of the genus ''[[Allium]]'' from India and [[vitamin E]]. The company promoted the supplement saying that they provide "more concentrated healthful energy in food form than any other product the world affords".<ref name=Morton/>

==Customs and beliefs==

Southeast Asian folk beliefs, as well as [[traditional Chinese medicine]], consider the durian fruit to have warming properties liable to cause [[excessive sweating]].<ref>{{cite book | title = The Pharmacology of Chinese Herbs (Second Edition) | author = Huang, Kee C. | publisher = [[CRC Press]] | pages = p. 2 | isbn = 0849316650 | year = 1998}}</ref> The traditional method to counteract this is to pour water into the empty shell of the fruit after the pulp has been consumed and drink it.<ref name=Davidson/> An alternative method is to eat the durian in accompaniment with [[mangosteen]] that is considered to have cooling properties. People with [[high blood pressure]] or pregnant women are traditionally advised not to consume durian.<ref name="Fuller"/><ref>{{cite book | title = Medical Anthropology in Ecological Perspective | author = McElroy, Anne and  Townsend, Patricia K. | publisher = Westview Press | year = 2003 | isbn = 0813338212 | pages = p. 253}}</ref>

Another common local belief is that the durian is harmful when eaten with [[coffee]]<ref name=Davidson/> or alcoholic beverages.<ref name=Brown/> The latter belief can be traced back at least to the 18th century when Rumphius declared that one should not drink alcohol after eating durians as it will cause indigestion and [[Halitosis|bad breath]]. In 1929, J. D. Gimlette stated in his ''Malay Poisons and Charm Cures'' that the durian fruit must not be eaten with [[brandy]]. In 1981, J. R. Croft wrote in his ''Bombacaceae: In Handbooks of the Flora of Papua New Guinea'' that a feeling of morbidity often follows the consumption of alcohol too soon after eating durian. Several medical investigations on the validity of this belief have been conducted with varying conclusions.<ref name=Brown/>

The [[Javanese]] believe durian to have [[aphrodisiac]] qualities, and impose a strict set of rules on what may or may not be consumed with it or shortly thereafter.<ref name=Davidson/> A saying in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], ''durian jatuh sarung naik'', meaning "the durians fall and the [[sarung]]s come up", refers to this belief.<ref>{{cite book | title = A Comprehensive Indonesian-English Dictionary  | first = Alan M. | last = Stevens | coauthors = A.

[[Image:Durian with sharp thorns.jpg|left|thumb|Durian fruit is armed with sharp thorns, fully capable of drawing blood.]]
A durian falling on a person's head can cause serious injuries because it is heavy, armed with sharp thorns, and can fall from a significant height. Wearing a [[hardhat]] is recommended when collecting the fruit. [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] writes that death rarely ensues from it, because the copious [[effusion]] of blood prevents the inflammation which might otherwise take place.<ref name=Wallace/> A common saying is that a durian has eyes and can see where it is falling because the fruit allegedly never falls during daylight hours when people may be hurt.<ref>{{cite web | title = Encyclopedia of Asian Food | url = http://www.asiafood.org/glossary_1.cfm?alpha=D&startno=27&endno=51 | date = 1998 | accessdate = 2007-07-26 | publisher = Periplus | first = Charmaine | last = Solomon }}</ref> A saying in Indonesian, ''ketiban durian runtuh'', which translates to "getting a fallen durian", means receiving an unexpected luck or fortune.<ref>{{cite book | title = An Indonesian-English Dictionary | first = John M. |last = Echols| coauthors = Hassan Shadily |publisher= Cornell University Press |year = 1989 |isbn = 0801421276| pages = p. 292}}</ref> Nevertheless, signs warning people not to linger under durian trees are found in Indonesia.<ref>{{cite book | title = Indonesia (Lonely Planet Travel Guides) | first = Justine |last = Vaisutis | coauthors = Neal Bedford, Mark Elliott, Nick Ray, Ryan Ver Berkmoes | pages = p. 393-394 | publisher = Lonely Planet Publications | isbn = 1741044359 | year = 2007}}</ref>

A naturally spineless variety of durian growing wild in [[Davao]], Philippines, was discovered in the 1960s; fruits borne from these seeds were also spineless.<ref name=Brown/> Because the bases of the scales develop into spines as the fruit matures, sometimes spineless durians are produced artificially by scraping scales off of immature fruits.<ref name=Brown/>

== Cultural influence ==
[[Image:The Esplanade 4, Singapore, Dec 05.JPG|right|thumb|Singapore's [[Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay|Esplanade]] building, nicknamed "The Durian"]]
The durian is commonly known as the "King of the Fruits",<ref name=Heaton/> a label that can be attributed to its formidable look and overpowering odour.<ref>The [[mangosteen]], called as the "queen of fruits", is petite and mild in comparison. The mangosteen season coincides with that of the durian and is seen as a complement, which is probably how the mangosteen received the complementary title.</ref> Due to its unusual characteristics, the durian has been referenced or parodied in various cultural mediums. To foreigners the durian is often perceived as a symbol of revulsion, as it can be seen in [[Dodoria]], one of the villains in the [[Anime|Japanese anime]] ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]''. Dodoria, whose name has been derived from the durian,<ref>{{ja icon}} {{cite web | url = http://www.dbmania.net/db-names.htm | title = ドラゴンボール登場人物名前由来 | publisher = ドラゴンボールマニア (Dragon Ball Mania) | accessdate = 2007-02-11}}</ref> was given a brutal appearance and a sinister role. In the ''[[Castlevania]]'' videogame series, "Rotten Durian" is an item that removes 500 [[Hit point|HP]] from the character if consumed; its in-game description reads "Has introduced you to a whole new world of unpleasant odors." The game ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' includes several minigames where one must throw fruit into baskets. The durian is unique among the fruit, in that it cannot be picked up because of its spiny exterior and instead must be kicked like a [[soccer ball]] into the basket. The [[role-playing game]], ''[[Tales of Destiny]]'' includes the durian (spelt ''Dorian'' by translators) as part of the edible food list. While fairly expensive and filling, the fruit, when consumed, also comes with an additional benefit of reducing random encounters by repelling monsters, presumably with its smell. The fruit was featured in the video game ''[[Madagascar (video game)|Madagascar]]'' where the main character battles the final boss that spews out debilitating durian breaths, with durians also used as projectile weapons.

[[Image:Davao-durian-monument.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Monument to durian at the [[Davao City|Davao]] International Airport]]
In its native southeastern Asia, however, the durian is an everyday food and portrayed in the local media in accordance with the different cultural perception it has in the region. The durian symbolised the subjective nature of ugliness and beauty in [[Hong Kong]] director [[Fruit Chan]]'s [[2000 in film|2000 film]] ''[[Durian Durian]]'' (榴槤飄飄, ''Liulian piao piao''), and was a nickname for the reckless but lovable protagonist of the eponymous Singaporean TV comedy ''Durian King'' played by [[Adrian Pang]].<ref name=STB>{{cite web | title = Uniquely Singapore - July 2006 Issue | url = http://www.visitsingapore.com/publish/stbportal/en/home/about_singapore/ezine_home/Jul06/local_speak/Durain_Story.html | year = 2006 | publisher = Singapore Tourism Board| accessdate = 2007-07-31 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070823005745/http://www.visitsingapore.com/publish/stbportal/en/home/about_singapore/ezine_home/Jul06/local_speak/Durain_Story.html 
|archivedate=2007-08-23}}</ref> Likewise, the oddly shaped [[Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay|Esplanade]] building in Singapore is often called "The Durian" by locals,<ref name=STB/> and "The Big Durian" is the nickname of [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]].<ref>{{ cite web

One of the names Thailand contributed to the list of storm names for Western North Pacific [[tropical cyclone]]s was '[[Typhoon Durian|Durian]]',<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.jma.go.jp/jma/jma-eng/jma-center/rsmc-hp-pub-eg/tyname.html | title = Tropical Cyclone Names | publisher = Japan Meteorological Agency | accessdate = 2007-03-10}}</ref> which was retired after the second storm of this name in [[2006 Pacific typhoon season|2006]]. Being a fruit much loved by a variety of wild beasts, the durian sometimes signifies the long-forgotten animalistic aspect of humans, as in the legend of [[Orang Mawas]], the Malaysian version of Bigfoot, and [[Orang Pendek]], its Sumatran version, both of which have been claimed to feast on durians.<ref>{{cite web | author = Lian, Hah Foong | url = http://www.bigfootencounters.com/creatures/mawas.htm | title = Village abuzz over sighting of 'mawas' | publisher = Star Publications, Malaysia | date = [[2000-01-02]] | accessdate = 2007-03-09 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.jambiexplorer.com/content/orangpendek.htm | title = Do 'orang pendek' really exist? | publisher = Jambiexplorer.com | accessdate = 2006-03-19 }}</ref>
