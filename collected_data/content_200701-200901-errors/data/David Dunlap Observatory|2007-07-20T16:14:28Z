The '''David Dunlap Observatory''' is an [[astronomy|astronomical]] [[observatory]] in [[Richmond Hill, Ontario|Richmond Hill]], [[Ontario]], owned by the [[University of Toronto]] and operated by its Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics. It is the site of the largest [[optical telescope]] in [[Canada]].

The observatory, founded in [[1935]], was a gift to the university from Jessie Donalda Dunlap as a memorial for her husband, David Alexander Dunlap. It was planned in consultation with astronomer [[Clarence Chant]], the observatory's first director, who had long hoped to establish a world-class astronomical facility in Canada. The selected site was a farm property located 25 kilometres north of the university's downtown [[Toronto]] campus. The original pre-[[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] [[farmhouse]] became the residence for the director.

At the time of its construction, the 1.88-metre telescope was the second-largest in the world. Soon after the observatory opened, a 0.5-metre [[Cassegrain reflector]] telescope was built on top of the administration building. In [[1965]], another Cassegrain telescope measuring 0.6 metres was installed.

C. Thomas Bolton, professor of astronomy and [[astrophysics]] at the University of Toronto, published the first identification of a [[black hole]] from his observation of [[Cygnus X-1]] at the observatory.
