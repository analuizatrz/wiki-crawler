'''East Carolina University''' ('''ECU''') is a [[public education|public]], [[coeducational]], [[research]] [[intensive]] [[university]] located in [[Greenville, North Carolina|Greenville]], [[North Carolina]], [[USA]]. ECU is the third largest university in North Carolina with an enrollment of over 24,000 students and the fastest-growing campus in the [[University of North Carolina]] system. ECU offers 109 bachelor’s, 79 master’s, 22 doctoral, and the MD degree programs. ECU name is derived from being the first college East of [[Raleigh]].  It is considered the flagship of Eastern North Carolina.

== History ==
[[image:ECU_Cupola.gif|thumb|left|150px|ECU Cupola.]]
ECU was chartered by the General Assembly on [[March 8]], [[1907]], as '''East Carolina Teachers Training School''' (ECTTS), a two-year institution. The chairman of its original board of trustees, [[Thomas Jordan Jarvis|T. J. Jarvis]], a former Governor of North Carolina now known as the "Father of ECU," participated in groundbreaking ceremonies for the first buildings on [[July 2]], [[1908]]. ECTTS opened its doors on [[October 5]], [[1909]]. Although its purpose was to train "young white men and women," there were no male graduates until [[1932]]. In [[1921]] ECTTS became a four-year institution and was renamed [[East Carolina Teachers College]] (ECTC); its first bachelor's degrees were awarded the following year. A master's degree program was authorized in [[1929]]; the first such degree granted by ECTC was in [[1933]]. Progress toward full college status was made in [[1948]] with the designation of the [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] as a liberal arts degree, and the [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] as a teaching degree. A change of name to '''East Carolina College''' in [[1951]] reflected this expanded mission. Racial segregation ended in [[1957]]. The years that followed saw the establishment of School of Nursing ([[1960]]), [[College of Business at East Carolina University|Business]] ([[1960]]), [[College of Fine Arts and Communication at East Carolina University|Art]] ([[1962]]), [[College of Fine Arts and Communication at East Carolina University|Music]] ([[1962]]), and [[East Carolina University College of Education|Education]] ([[1963]]), as well as the [[College of Fine Arts and Communication at East Carolina University|College of Arts and Sciences]] ([[1964]]), later named for [[Thomas Harriot]]. Over the objections of [[Dan K. Moore|Governor Dan K. Moore]], who opposed the creation of a university system separate from the Consolidated University of North Carolina, ECC was made a regional university effective [[July 1]], [[1967]], and assumed its present name, East Carolina University. It did not, however, remain independent for long; on [[July 1]], [[1972]], it was incorporated into the [[University of North Carolina System]], the successor to the Consolidated University. Subsequent foundations at ECU include the School of Industry and Technology ([[1970]]); (now called the [[College of Technology and Computer Science at East Carolina University|College of Technology and Computer Science]]), the [[Brody School of Medicine at East Carolina University|School of Medicine]] (authorized in [[1974]], opened in [[1977]], renamed the Brody School of Medicine in [[1999]], the School of Social Work ([[1986]]); now called [[The College of Human Ecology at East Carolina University|The College of Human Ecology]], and the [[The College of Health and Human Performance at East Carolina University|College of Health and Human Performance]] ([[1993]]).

'''Future of East Carolina'''
*At the last Board of Trustees meeting, the members unanimously passed a resolution to start a Dental School. The Dental School has also been unanimously approved by the UNC System Board of Governers.  The next step is Legislative funding.
*[[Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium]] is in the beginning process of expansion. Starting the Fall of [[2006]], a temporary bleacher section will be erected on the East side under the scoreboard. The marching band and the students who are not in the Student Pirate Club will be moved to this location. In the next few years, the stadium will become horseshoed in connecting the North and South side. Also at [[Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium|Dowdy-Ficklen]], on the South side a new Press Box and office complex will be built. The total height will be about six stories, or two stories over the top of the [[Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium|stadium]]
