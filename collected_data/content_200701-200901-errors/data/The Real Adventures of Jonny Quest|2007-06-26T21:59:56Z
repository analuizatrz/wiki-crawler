==Development and history==

''The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest'' was conceived circa 1993 as part of Hanna-Barbera's revival of the ''Quest'' franchise amidst fan interest and support.<ref name="peoria">{{cite journal | last = Timm | first = Lori | title = CUE CARD>LOST ON QUEST FOR BROAD APPEAL | date=1994-09-15 | journal = [[Peoria Journal Star]] p.

Producers contracted seven studios to animate the first season. An international team handled digital post-production and QuestWorld scenes, while [[Japan]]ese and [[Korea]]n animators drew traditional [[cel]] sequences.<ref name="animag" /> Over a quarter of the first season's footage was digitally inked and painted "to enhance the background and the atmospheric elements."<ref name="animag" /> The process was applied in "excess of 20 hours per episode...just for effects, beyond the normal things you do...We added light effects, rain, snow, glitter, reflections, fog, [which] made things much more realistic."<ref name="animag" /> The Japan-based Mook Studios exclusively animated the second season.<ref name="anipla" /> [[Composer]] Gary Lionelli updated the original ''Jonny Quest'' theme; he and other artists wrote incidental music and cues used in both seasons. Composer [[Guy Moon]] called it the "hardest thing I've done in my life", as the producers "want it big, Big, BIG."<ref name="guymoon">{{cite web | title=Guy Moon | year=1996 | author=Jennifer Clay | url=http://www.bmi.com/guymoon.html | publisher=[[BMI]] | archivedate=1996-10-20 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19961020023157/http://bmi.com/guymoon.html | accessdate=19 June | accessyear=2007}}</ref> "They want a big orchestra with a good synth rig...It's great because they push me so much I'll probably replace my whole demo reel with Jonny Quest music.

===QuestWorld===

Producers cultivated an element of [[virtual reality]] through QuestWorld, an area of cyberspace rendered with three-dimensional computer animation and [[motion capture]].<ref name="animag" /> QuestWorld was designed as an extension of contemporary technology, similar to the classic series's high-tech lasers, satellites, and robots.<ref name="timesherald" /> Seibert traced its origin to "the same problem that James Bond [has]...When you look at even his newest gadgets, they're somewhat quaint."<ref name="jonnyredux" /> Inspiration came from [[cyberpunk]] novels written by [[Neal Stephenson]] and [[William Gibson]], including ''[[Snow Crash]]''.<ref name="jonnyredux" /> QuestWorld characters were created as [[wire frame]] models, augmented with faces scanned from clay busts, then digitally painted and inked.<ref name="jonnyredux" /> A company named Buzz F/X, based in [[Montreal]] and [[Santa Monica]], created computer animation for the first season.<ref name="lord">{{cite web | author=Francois Lord | title=Francois Lord's Commentary | date=1997-04-11 | url=http://questfan.com/wiki/index.php?title=Francois_Lord%27s_Commentary | accessdate=19 June | accessyear=2007}}</ref> Work began in April 1996, and animators first tackled the opening titles—a gliding journey through a canyon of green, cartographic lines with scenes illuminated upon the walls. Budgetary constraints forbade the supervision of experienced animators in Montreal, allegedly "why the opening sequence is so ugly" according to one of the company's animators.<ref name="lord" /> Short segments of action and adventure called ''Quest Bytes'' were also produced to follow certain episodes.
[[Image:Trajq-questworld-tobardoandback.png|right|200px|thumb|Race and Surd fighting in QuestWorld from season one's ''To Bardo and Back'']]
Work for ''Escape to Questworld'' and ''Trouble on the Colorado'' followed, and the untested animators worked "12 hours a day, 6 days a week in a small garage" with insufficient computers.<ref name="lord" /> Roughly ten more were hired in July; only two had work experience. The amateur employees struggled with lighting scenes and syncing jerky motion capture from the House of Moves in [[Venice Beach]].<ref name="lord" /> By August, the team was working "14 hours a day, 7 days a week," and were accustomed to working full nights and mornings.<ref name="lord" /> After two more episodes, Buzz F/X cut its losses and terminated the contract with Hanna-Barbera, which hired [[Blur Studio]] to finish season two.<ref name="lord" /> Blur used [[Intergraph]] hardware for its sequences and ''Quest Bytes''. The company's sharp performance in meeting deadlines and highly visible usage of Intergraph attracted press attention and sealed an amicable relationship with Hanna-Barbera.<ref name="wiregraph">{{cite journal | title = Intergraph Workstations Play Starring Role in "The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest" at Blur Studio | date=1997-02-12 | journal = [[Business Wire]] | publisher = Gale Group}}</ref><ref name="intergraph">{{cite web | title=Intergraph takes on new 'Quest' | year=1997 | author=James McWilliams | url=http://www.htimes.com/today/access/oldfiles/quest.html | publisher=The Huntsville Times | archivedate=1997-07-28 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19970728084643/http://www.htimes.com/today/access/oldfiles/quest.html | accessdate=15 June | accessyear=2007}}</ref> Roughly 100 minutes of computer animation for QuestWorld was produced—more than any previous show or feature, including ''[[Toy Story]]''.<ref name="animag" />

==Creative direction==

Dr. Quest, a famous [[phenomenology|phenomenologist]], investigates mysterious occurrences and exotic locales with his son, Jonny Quest, bodyguard Race Bannon, Race's daughter Jessie, assistant Hadji Singh, and pet [[bulldog]] Bandit.<ref name="animag" /><ref name="virgin">{{cite journal | title = Virgin Sound and Vision inks licensing agreement with Turner New Media; VSV brings Hanna-Barbera's The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest into computer age with CD-ROM | date=1996-03-18 | journal = [[Business Wire]] | publisher = Gale Group}}</ref> Peter Lawrence set the story several years after the classic series, with Jonny and his friends now teenagers.<ref name="bible" /> Certain episodes took place almost entirely in the virtual environment of QuestWorld, and the team would frequently encounter the villainous [[Jeremiah Surd]] and [[Ezekiel Rage]]. Lawrence aimed to use "existing, real phenomenon"—such as the "Airstrips of [[Nazca]], the Ruins of [[Teotihuacan]] or the possible existence of [[Giant Squid]]"—to capture the curiosity of audiences.<ref name="bible" /> Stressing that "plausibility is a keynote", he suggested coverage of real-world mysteries, [[cryptozoology]], exotic locales, or fictional but "believable" mysteries.<ref name="bible" /> The Quests would sparingly encounter "monster[s] of the week...simply out to get [them]", instead battling not "necessarily malevolent" antagonists whose conflicts lay in "personal objective or ambition...opposed by Dr. Quest."<ref name="bible" /> Lawrence stationed the family at a new compound on the coast of Maine, replete with "houses, barns and workshops."<ref name="bible" /> Rooms suited for each character included a library for Dr. Quest, workshop for Jonny, computer-equipped den for Jessie, dojo and gym for Race, and lighthouse lookout for Hadji's meditation.<ref name="bible" /> Lawrence equipped Dr. Quest with a fleet of air, land, and sea vehicles, including a [[World War II]]-era [[biplane]] and state-of-the-art [[catamaran]] named ''Questor'' with [[diving bell]]s and smaller research vessels stored in the hulls.<ref name="bible" /><ref name="vehicles">{{cite web | title=Vehicles | url=http://questfan.com/wiki/index.php?title=Vehicles | work=[http://www.questfan.com QuestFan] | accessdate=20 June | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

===Characters===
[[Image:Trajq-expeditiontokhumbu.png|right|200px|thumb|Hadji, Jessie, and Jonny from the season one episode ''Expedition to Khumbu'']]
Seibert explained Jonny's age as one in which "you think you can solve problems like an adult, but you may go get yourself into trouble."<ref name="jonnyredux" /> Lawrence wrote Jonny, age 14, as "somewhat cooler...a tough kid with a straight-ahead, right-on attitude...But he's not a punk. He's got guts...and heart...His life is cool and he embraces it wholeheartedly."<ref name="bible" /> Lawrence and later writers emphasized that Jonny was "more a Man-Of-Action in training...than an intellectual," and created tension by contrasting his father's academic leanings with Jonny's affinity for Race's lifestyle.<ref name="bible" /> Hadji, age 16, became Dr. Quest's personal assistant, who "does not have his mentor's formal education in the sciences but he shares his burning interest in archaeology, anthropology and, particularly, the paranormal."<ref name="bible" /> A [[Sikh]] and student [[yogin]], he exhibited a "fatalistic and accepting attitude to whatever is happening...[starting] from the philosophical point of view that everything is as it's supposed to be."<ref name="bible" /> Hadji often used wise aphorisms, taken from "any culture or any source...Sometimes it will baffle Jonny."<ref name="bible" /> Lawrence cut Hadji's classic [[telekinesis]], and aligned his abilities with realistic yogin practices. "He doesn't say things like 'Sim, Sim Sala Bim' anymore," season one voice [[Michael Benyaer]] explained. "The writers and producers actually researched the actual yogic powers. He can do more plausible stuff. There is an episode where Hadji pretends to stop his breathing so that the bad guys think he is dead."<ref name="cinef">{{cite journal | last = Kingston | first = F. Colin | title = Older and bolder, the cartoon quester returns on Turner TV. | date=October 1996 | journal = [[Cinefantastique]] | volume = 28 | issue = 3}}</ref>

Jessie Bannon, age 15, was characterized as "just as tough...smarter...[and] more thoughtful" than Jonny, and "more in tune with Hadji". She was "more of an egghead" who elected to spend time with Dr. Quest as Jonny did with Race.<Ref name="bible" /> Her father, age 38, retained his classic "laconic sense of humor" and "fearless and utterly dependable" nature.<Ref name="bible" /> Race Bannon retired from government work due to ethical scruples with his former intelligence agency.<ref name="jonnyredux" /> Writers noted that Race "can't help being the overprotective Dad" for Jessie, while Jonny is "the boy Race never had."<ref name="jonnyredux" /> His new western accent and elaborate [[simile]]s were met with resistance from older ''Quest'' fans.<ref name="semifaq" /> Dr. Benton Quest, age 55, retired from government research and operated from the "Quest Compound" on the coast of Maine.<ref name="bible" /> "Driven by his desire to know more about...the inexplicable worldwide phenomena which he investigates," he was "consulted by individuals, governments and corporations to investigate any mysterious chain of events."<Ref name="bible" /> Described as "single-minded - almost to the point of obsession - in his pursuit of knowledge," he often encountered trouble as "his drive to learn blanks out more basic instincts like self-preservation."<Ref name="bible" /> Jessie appreciated his "ponderous" sense of humor.<Ref name="bible" /> Lawrence removed Bandit, the Quest's [[bulldog]]'s clownish origins and presented him in useful roles.<Ref name="bible" /> Summarizing the group's behavior, he wrote:

{{cquote2|Jonny's response to danger will be close to Race's.  Jessie's intrigue with mysterious, unexplained phenomena will be close to Dr. Quest's.  And Hadji, with his roots in a different culture and a more spiritual approach to life, is different again.<ref name="bible" />}}

In response to preliminary criticism over character changes, Fred Seibert hoped ''Real Adventures'' would find success as new interpretations of [[comic book]] heroes had done.<ref name="angryclassicfan">{{cite journal | last = Rollins | first = Ron | title = SEEN & OVERHEARD | date=1996-10-22 | journal = [[Dayton Daily News]] p. 3C | publisher = Cox Ohio Publishing}}</ref><ref name="animag" /> The season two team notwithstanding changed Takashi's designs and steered the show to its classic roots.<ref name="semifaq" /> Hadji regained his childhood mystical powers, as according to story editor Glenn Leopold he "developed latent psionic powers that appear 'magical'."<ref name="bible" /> Leopold resurrected spoon-bending and "rope tricks", debasing the realism of season one as "not that interesting to watch...With Hadji, the more visual his 'power', the better."<ref name="bible" /> All characters lost an age; Jonny was now 13.<ref name="bible" /> He returned Race to being a governmental bodyguard, sealed by an episodic visit with classic agency leader Phil Corbin.<ref name="bible" /><ref name="racecommentary">{{cite web | title=Lance Falk Episode Commentary #5 Race Against Danger | author=Lance Falk | date=1997-02-23 | url=http://questfan.com/wiki/index.php?title=Lance_Falk%27s_Episode_Commentary#.235_Race_Against_Danger | accessdate=19 June | accessyear=2007}}</ref> While Race lost his western accent, Dr. Quest gained his classic red hair and rudimentary combat skills.<ref name="thoughtcommentary">{{cite web | title=Lance Falk Episode Commentary #3 Thoughtscape | author=Lance Falk | date=1997-02-14 | url=http://questfan.com/wiki/index.php?title=Lance_Falk%27s_Episode_Commentary#.233_Thoughtscape | accessdate=19 June | accessyear=2007}}</ref> Initially resistant to Jessie, writer Lance Falk came to regard her as the "missing piece needed to complete the Quest family," and Leopold added slight romantic overtones.<ref name="anipla" /> Regarding season two episode ''Undersea Urgency'' and others, fans complained that Jessie was reduced to a [[damsel in distress]] with stereotypically-female pink clothes.<ref name="thoughtcommentary" /> Falk defended his decision to portray her as having realistic, "human" fears.<ref name="thoughtcommentary" /><ref name="semifaq" /> An academic paper on animated gender stereotypes later pointed out that Jonny saved Jessie from danger six times during an episode.<ref name="genderstereotypes">{{cite web | title=Gender Stereotypes in Children's Television Cartoons | author=Kelly Eick | date=May 1998 | url=http://cla.calpoly.edu/%7Ejrubba/495/papersS98/paper1.html | publisher=California Polytechnic College of Liberal Arts | accessdate=19 June | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

Leopold and Falk took greater creative liberties with ''Real Adventures'', invoking ghosts, other dimensions, and megalomaniacal schemes. Whereas Lawrence's team wrote "lots of spiritual, mystical plots...[where] they uncover a lot of hoaxes," the second season team geared towards a "slam-bang adventure show with real monsters" and the "action's emphasis more [on] Jonny" and his friends.<ref name="anipla" /><ref name="bible" /> Falk explained, "I strive for accuracy...but if it gets in the way of "cool"...cool's gonna win out every time (as it should)," and emphasized that "Jonny Quest is a show with one foot in the ''fantastic'', and one foot solidly based in reality."<ref name="wintercommentary" /><ref name="anipla" /> Resistant to the ubiquitous use of QuestWorld, the team was nonetheless contractually obligated to use the concept throughout the new season.<ref name="anipla" /> Falk felt that virtual reality paradoxically undermined the show's "strong connection to reality," and suggested that after so many dangerous incidents Dr. Quest would have simply turned the system off.<ref name="semifaq" /> The team brought back several classic characters passed over by Lawrence, including Pasha the Peddler, Jezebel Jade, and Dr. Zin.<ref name="anipla" /> Falk also honored ''Quest'' creator [[Doug Wildey]] by creating an eponymous grandfather for Jonny who ranches the western United States in the episode ''Nuclear Netherworld''.<ref name="anipla" /> Leopold introduced Estella Velasquez as Jessie's mother to retcon the telefilms, as Jade "would never get married to anybody."<ref name="anipla" /> Writers episodically eliminated villains Rage and Surd in favor of new adversaries.<ref name="anipla" /> Comparing ''Quest'' without Zin to "James Bond without S.P.E.C.T.R.E.", Falk penned a season finale featuring the robot spies from the eponymous classic episode and a visceral fight between Dr. Quest and Zin.<ref name="anipla" /> With the Maine compound destroyed in the aftermath, the creative team planned to revive Palm Key as the ''Quest'' home in new episodes. However, Cartoon Network did not renew ''Real Adventures'', despite a pledge to explore the history of Jonny's mother in the season premiere.<ref name="anipla" />

==Cast==

The first season of ''Real Adventures'' featured [[J. D. Roth]] as Jonny, [[George Segal]] as Dr. Quest, [[Robert Patrick]] as Race, [[Jesse Douglas (actress)|Jesse Douglas]] as Jessie, and [[Michael Benyaer]] as Hadji. A childhood fan of the original series, J.D. Roth remarked that he was "so into the idea of what they were trying to accomplish that I had to be Jonny."<ref name="cinef" /> Roth was attracted by Jonny's characterization as "a real kid, who has real instincts, who wants to help people. He has star quality."<ref name="roth1">{{cite web | date=1996-08-21 | author=Ellen Gray | title=The new `Jonny Quest' is full of ideas for children's programming  | url=http://www.newstimes.com/archive/aug2196/tvf.htm | publisher=Knight-Ridder Media | archivedate=1997-04-30 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19970430170024/http://www.newstimes.com/archive/aug2196/tvf.htm|  accessdate=15 June | accessyear=2007}}</ref> He found that "[Jonny] doesn't think about how he's going to do it; he just wants to go do it...he is full of enthusiasm, and it is infectious."<ref name="cinef" /> Roth admired the show's educational quality, something he had tried to integrate in his personal television pilots.<ref name="roth1" /> He later expressed that "Jonny is crazy about his dad. He looks up to him and thinks he is the smartest man ever to walk to face of the earth. He has the typical teenage relationship with his father, but his father definitely sees something in him. Dr Quest knows that Jonny is going to be something really special."<ref name="cinef" /> Michael Banyaer enjoyed playing Hadji—"[he] is one of the few roles for an ethnic actor that is not a bad guy. I mean, how many East Indian heros have been on television? Hadji is for the sensitive kids out there. He is the outsider in all of us."<ref name="cinef" /> A [[Star Wars]] fan, Banyaer also relished the opportunity to work with [[Mark Hamill]].<ref name="cinef" />

When asked about the introduction of Jessie to the team, Jesse Douglas stated, "I'd be bummed if I upset anybody. Jessie is pretty cool. It is not like she is a girl who is whining all the time. If anything, she is a really good springboard for the rest of the storyline."<ref name="cinef" /> Roth supported her, claiming that "Jonny hasn't discovered girls yet but when he does Jessie would be the type of girl he'd like to be with...I think something will happen between them but right now Jess is his best friend."<ref name="cinef" /> Second season changes prompted Hanna-Barbera to buy out the first cast's contracts and hire new actors.<ref name="semifaq" /> Season two featured [[Quinton Flynn]] as Jonny, [[John de Lancie]] as Dr. Quest, [[Granville Van Dusen]] (initial episodes) and [[Robert Foxworth]] as Race, [[Jennifer Hale]] as Jessie, and [[Rob Paulsen]] as Hadji. Turner contacted [[Don Messick]] to reprise his role as Dr. Quest, but he suffered a stroke during early sessions and died the next year.<ref name="anipla" /> His recorded dialogue included work on the episode ''Rock of Rages'', one line of which survived overdubbing by de Lancie.<ref name="ragescommentary">{{cite web | title=Lance Falk Episode Commentary #1 Rock of Rages | author=Lance Falk | date=1997-02-08 | url=http://questfan.com/wiki/index.php?title=Lance_Falk%27s_Episode_Commentary#.231_Rock_of_Rages | accessdate=19 June | accessyear=2007}}</ref> Van Dusen voiced Bannon in the 1986 ''Quest'' series, and Foxworth took over the part coincidentally after an audition for Dr. Quest.<ref name="anipla" /> Paulsen previously voiced Hadji in the two ''Quest'' telefilms.<ref name="paulsen">{{cite web | title=IMDb: Rob Paulsen | url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0667326/ | publisher=Internet Movie Database Inc. | accessdate=19 June | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

Turner Home Entertainment pushed a massive marketing campaign to promote ''Real Adventures'', working with a "small army" of thirty-three licensees and sponsors.<ref name="brandweek3" /><ref name="marketing" /> The company claimed to invest $20 million towards merchandising and promotion, with each network spending $5-7 million.<ref name="brandweek3">{{cite journal | last = Matzer | first = Marla | title = Pillsbury, Campbell's join in new Quest. | date=1996-06-24 | journal = [[Brandweek]] | volume = 37 | issue = 26 | publisher = VNU eMedia, Inc.}}</ref> Other press reports pegged the budget at $40 or even $100 million.<ref name="brandweek2" /><ref name="OVER9000LOL">{{cite journal | title = Ned Beatty leaving "Homicide' series | date=1995-06-21 | journal = [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]] Times p. 2B}}</ref> [[Wall Street Journal]] called ''Quest'' a "property to watch" in 1995; [[People (magazine)|People]] and [[Good Housekeeping]] considered it a surefire blockbuster.<ref name="timesherald" /><ref name="people">{{cite journal | title = Fast forward. | date=1995-07-10 | journal = [[People (magazine)|People]] | volume = 44 | issue = 2 | publisher = People Magazine (Time)}}</ref><ref name="housekeeping">{{cite journal | title = WHAT'S HOT THIS YEAR | date=Dec. 1996 | journal = [[Good Housekeeping]] | volume = 223 | issue = 6 | publisher = Hearst Brand Development}}</ref> Potential merchandisers were given a digital [[style guide]] with a collection of ''Quest'' artwork, coloring instructions, and product mock-ups.<ref name="dsg">{{cite web | title=Jonny Quest Digital Style Guide | url=http://questfan.com/wiki/index.php?title=Jonny_Quest_Digital_Style_Guide | work=[http//questfan.com QuestFan] | accessdate=24 June | accessyear=2007}}</ref> [[Pillsbury]] included $3 mail-in rebates for future ''Quest'' videos, display contests, and instant coupon offers on over twenty million packages.<Ref name="brandweek2" /> [[Campbell Soup Company]] released six holographic miniature posters on the same number of [[SpaghettiOs]] cans.

[[Galoob]] secured figurine licensing rights in 1995 and created a product line of vehicles, figures, and [[Micro Machines]] for fall 1996 release.<Ref name="brandweek2" /> The figures were not popular outside of the [[United States]]; new designs were shelved and the line discontinued in 1997.<ref name="galoobnotpopular">{{cite journal | title = BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS | date=1997-10-20 | journal = The Pantagraph (Bloomington, Illinois)}}</ref><ref name="galoob">{{cite web | title=Jonny Quest: Quest Headquarters | url=http://www.galoob.com/JQ/index.html | archivedate=1997-04-13 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19970413222402/http://galoob.com/JQ/index.html | accessdate=15 June | accessyear=2007}}</ref><ref name="galoob2">{{cite web | title=Jonny Quest Unproduced Toys | url=http://www.mindspring.com/~questworld-online/unreleased.html | accessdate=15 June | accessyear=2007}}</ref> [[General Mills]] outfitted boxes of [[Honey Nut Cheerios]] and [[Cinnamon Toast Crunch]] with offers for tee shirts and other items.<ref name="brandweek3" /> [[Upper Deck Company]] used art, sketches, and plots from the first season to create a card collection with sixty individual pieces.

Several products were listed in the "Quest Adventure Value Pack" catalogue, which encouraged $40 savings through combined purchases.<ref name="brandweek3" /> Among other products, the catalogue was packaged with [[Kid Rhino]]'s [[cassette]] audio adventure based on the episode ''Return of the Anasazi''.<ref name="kidrhino">{{cite web | date=1996-09-17 | title=The new KID RHINO TAKES A JOURNEY INTO THE WORLD OF JONNY QUEST  | url=http://www.rhino.com/hotpress/jonnyquestpr.html | publisher=Knight-Ridder Media | archivedate=1997-06-14 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19970614064532/http://www.rhino.com/hotpress/jonnyquestpr.html |  accessdate=19 June | accessyear=2007}}</ref> The show's [[credits]] advertised a [[soundtrack]] available from Rhino, but such a release was never otherwise promoted or sold.<ref name="semifaq" /> The campaign culminated with the release of eight season one episodes over [[VHS]] with suggested retail prices of $12.98 per unit.<ref name="marketing" /> The size of the push left one newspaper reviewer wondering, "are [the Quests] back because they're too cool to die, or because they're too well known to be squandered as a licensing product?"<ref name="dailyheraldrevue" /> [[Hanna-Barbera]] chief [[Fred Seibert]] expected high sales and success:

{{cquote2|The new series is the beginning of what will be a multi-faceted global programming, marketing and merchandising effort...The property still has great recognition and we think this will work because of the production values, because it's a real person solving real problems, and because it's the property that started the genre.<Ref name="timesherald" /><ref name="brandweek2" />}}

[[Dark Horse Comics]] composed a twelve issue series released over the show's first run; publisher [[Mike Richardson (publisher)|Mike Richardson]] felt that "the massive exposure Turner is giving Quest...could truly drive traffic into the comic stores.

[[Image:Trajq-jessiebentondarkestfathoms.png|right|200px|thumb|Dr. Quest and Jessie, a subject of initial debate, in season one's ''The Darkest Fathoms'']]

The [[Toronto Star]] scathingly criticized the show for hosting "facile plots heavily laced with jarring science fiction and incongruous computer animation," and called QuestWorld a "poorly explained techno-gimmick."<ref name="torontostar" /> Though praising the computer animation, The Star regarded the traditional sequences as "flat and textureless, with minimal characterization, unnaturally stiff movement and poor execution of shading and shadow."<ref name="torontostar" /> Ted Cox of the Chicago Daily Herald disagreed, lauding "realistic" traditional and digital animation—"such as the play of light on the ocean."<ref name="dailyheraldrevue" /> Cox conceded that in some spots, motion seemed "remarkably uneven".<ref name="dailyheraldrevue" /> Greg Aaron of [[HotWired]] praised the franchise's return, but warned against QuestWorld hype, arguing that "it will take more than visual sophistication to hook today's viewers".<ref name="jonnyredux" /> Senior vice president of production Sherry Gunther admitted that the motion capture technology was "best reserved for recording broad movements...because the technology is still a little crude."<ref name="jonnyredux" /> 

Alberto Menache expanded this criticism of QuestWorld in ''Understanding Motion Capture for Computer Animation and Video Games'', calling the virtual reality simulation a "failure" laden with "many mistakes."<Ref name="capturecrit">{{cite book | last = Menache | first = Alberto | coauthors = | title = Understanding Motion Capture for Computer Animation and Video Games | publisher = Morgan Kaufmann | date = October 1999 | pages = 52-53 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=9njZ482OYfwC&dq | isbn=0124906303}}</ref> The size difference between the motion capturers and the actual characters caused unsteady animation and shaking, consequently mismatching interaction with props or uneven terrain.<Ref name="capturecrit" /> Menache levied blame upon the show's budget, which did not allow for digital post-production and review. Producers instead expected "plug-and-play" results straight from the capture studio.<Ref name="capturecrit" /> Menache concluded that the QuestWorld sequences were the result of a "pipeline set up for mass production" with little testing or advance planning.<Ref name="capturecrit" /> These criticisms mirrored the comments of Buzz F/X animator Francois Lord, who revealed that most of the company's teams were inexperienced and forced to deliver on a rushed schedule.<ref name="lord" /> Lord pointed out that aside from having experienced workers, Blur Studio—the second QuestWorld animation company—"had twice as [much] time as we did and twice as [much] money."<ref name="lord" /> Menache was less critical of the facial capture, considering it "medium-quality...but still acceptable for the kind of television budget this project had."<Ref name="capturecrit" />
