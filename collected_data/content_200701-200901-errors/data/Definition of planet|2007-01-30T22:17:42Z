The '''definition of "[[planet]]"''' has been the subject of intense debate in recent years. Although the word itself dates back  millennia, there was no official scientific definition of a "planet" until the early 21st century.

Traditionally, the term was only applied to objects in the [[Solar System]], and any differences there could be dealt with on an individual basis. After 1992, however, astronomers began to discover many additional objects beyond the orbit of [[Neptune]], as well as hundreds of objects [[extrasolar planet|orbiting other stars]]. These discoveries not only increased the number of potential planets, but also expanded their variety and peculiarity. Some are nearly large enough to be [[star]]s, while others are smaller than our [[Moon]], and they have challenged long perceived notions of what a planet could be. 

The issue of a clear definition for "planet" came to a head in 2005 with the discovery of the [[trans-Neptunian object]] [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], a body larger than the smallest accepted planet, [[Pluto]]. In response, the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU), recognised by astronomers as the international body responsible for resolving issues of astronomical nomenclature, released its [[2006 redefinition of planet|decision]] on the matter. This definition, which applies only to the Solar System, states that a planet is a body that orbits the [[Sun]], is large enough for its own gravity to make it round, and has "[[Clearing the neighbourhood|cleared its neighbourhood]]" of smaller objects.  

Pluto does not qualify as a planet under this definition, and the Solar System is thus considered to have eight planets: [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]]. The new category of [[dwarf planet]] was created, currently including Pluto, Eris, and [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]]. The IAU's decision has not resolved all controversies, however, and some in the astronomical community have rejected it outright. The issue of what constitutes a planet will likely remain contentious at least until 2009, when the IAU holds its next Congress in [[Rio de Janeiro]].<ref>

==History==
[[Image:Cellarius ptolemaic system.jpg|thumb|250px|The planets as understood before the acceptance of the [[heliocentric model]].]]

The word "[[planet]]" has meant many things in its long life, some of them contradictory. When originally coined by the [[ancient Greeks]], a planet was any object that appeared to wander against the field of fixed [[star]]s that made up the night sky (''asteres planetai'' "wandering stars"). This included not only the five "classical" planets, that is, [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]], but also the [[Sun]] and the [[Moon]] (the "[[seven heavenly objects]]"). However, a distinction was occasionally made in terminology; the "five planets" (excluding the Sun and the Moon) were referred to alongside the "seven planets" (including the Sun and the Moon), so that the term "planet", even at this early stage, had acquired ambiguity. 

Eventually, when the [[heliocentric model]] was accepted over the [[geocentric]], [[Earth]] was placed among their number and the Sun was dropped, and after [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] discovered his four [[natural satellite|satellites]] of Jupiter, the Moon was also eventually reclassified. However, the [[Galilean moons|Galilean satellites]] of Jupiter (in 1610), Saturn's satellite [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] in 1659, and [[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]] and [[Rhea (moon)|Rhea]] in 1673 were initially described as "planets", not "moons"; the word "moon" at that time only referred to Earth's Moon.

In 1781, the astronomer [[William Herschel]] was searching the sky for [[binary stars]] when he observed what he termed a [[comet]] in the constellation of [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]]. That this strange object might have been a planet simply did not occur to him; the five planets beyond Earth had been part of humanity's conception of the universe since antiquity. However, unlike a comet, this object's orbit was nearly circular and within the ecliptic plane. Eventually it was recognised as the seventh planet and named [[Uranus]].<ref>
{{cite book | author=Croswell, Ken | year=1999 | title=Planet Quest: The Epic Discovery of Alien Solar Systems| publisher= Oxford University Press pp. 34-35 (ISBN 0-19-288083-7)}}</ref>

Gravitationally induced irregularities in Uranus's observed orbit led eventually to the discovery of [[Neptune]] in 1846, and calculation errors that were thought to be irregularities in Neptune's orbit led to the search which ultimately located [[Pluto]] in 1930. Pluto was later discovered to be too small to have caused those irregularities, which [[Voyager 2]] determined were due to an overestimation of Neptune's mass.<ref>{{cite web | author=Paul Schlyter | title=Appendix 7: Hypothetical Planets| work=nineplanets.org| url=http://www.nineplanets.org/hypo.html| accessdate=2006-10-04}} </ref>

Pluto rendered obsolete such prior considerations as roughly circular orbit, orbit-perturbing mass, and lying within the ecliptic, as none of them applied to it. Astronomers had therefore to look elsewhere for a definition.

===Minor planets===
One of the unexpected results of [[William Herschel|William Herschel's]] discovery of [[Uranus]] was that it appeared to validate [[Bode's law]], a mathematical function which generates the size of the [[semimajor axis]] of planetary [[orbit]]s. Astronomers had considered the Law a meaningless coincidence, but Uranus fell at very nearly the exact distance it predicted. Since Bode's Law also predicted a body between [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]] that at that point had not been observed, astronomers turned their attention to that region in the hope that it might be vindicated again. Finally, in 1801, astronomer [[Giuseppe Piazzi]] found a miniature new world, [[1 Ceres|Ceres]], lying at just the correct point in space. The object was hailed as a new planet.<ref name="Ceres">{{cite web | author=Hilton, James L. | title=When did asteroids become minor planets? | work=U.S. Naval Observatory | url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/hilton/AsteroidHistory/minorplanets.html | accessdate=2006-05-25}} </ref>

Then in 1802, [[Heinrich Wilhelm Matthäus Olbers|Heinrich Olbers]] discovered [[2 Pallas|Pallas]], a second "planet" at roughly the same distance from the [[Sun]] as Ceres. The idea that two planets could occupy the same orbit was an affront to centuries of thinking. Some years later, another world, [[3 Juno|Juno]], was discovered in a similar orbit. Over the following decades, several more were discovered, all within relatively the same orbital distance.<ref name="Ceres" /> 

Herschel suggested that these worlds be given their own separate classification, [[asteroid]]s (meaning "starlike" since they were too small for their disks to resolve and thus resembled [[star]]s), though most astronomers preferred to refer to them as planets. Science textbooks in 1828, after Herschel's death, still numbered the asteroids among the planets. By 1851, the number of asteroids had increased to 15, and a new method of classifying them, by adding a number before their names, was adopted, inadvertently placing them in their own distinct category. By the 1860s, observatories in Europe and the United States began referring to them as "[[minor planet]]s", or "small planets", though it took the first four asteroids longer to be grouped as such.<ref name="Ceres" />

The long road from planethood to reconsideration undergone by Ceres is mirrored in the story of [[Pluto]], which was named a planet soon after its discovery in 1930. Pluto was an anomaly: a tiny, icy world in a region of [[gas giant]]s with an orbit that carried it high above the plane of the [[ecliptic]] and even inside that of [[Neptune]]. However, it was, as far as anyone could tell, unique. Then, beginning in 1992, astronomers began to detect large numbers of icy bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune that were similar in composition and size to Pluto. They concluded that they had discovered the long-hypothesised [[Kuiper Belt]] (sometimes called the [[Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt]]), a band of icy debris that is the source for "short-period" comets&mdash;those, like [[Halley's comet|Halley]], with orbital periods of up to 200 years.<ref>{{cite web | author=Weissman, Paul R. | title=The Kuiper Belt| work=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics| url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995ARA&A..33..327W
| accessdate=2006-10-04}}</ref>

Pluto's orbit lay right in the middle of this band and thus its planetary status was thrown into question; the precedent set by Ceres in downgrading an object from planet status because of a shared orbit led many to conclude that Pluto must be reclassified as a minor planet as well. [[Michael E. Brown|Mike Brown]] of the [[California Institute of Technology]] suggested that a "planet" should be redefined as "any body in the solar system that is more massive than the total mass of all of the other bodies in a similar orbit."<ref>{{cite web | author=Brown, Mike. | title=A World on the Edge | work=[[NASA]] Solar System Exploration | url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=105 | accessdate=2006-05-25}}</ref> The eight planets over that mass limit would be referred to as "major planets". There was outcry at the prospect of Pluto's "demotion", and in 1999 the [[International Astronomical Union]] clarified that it was not at that time proposing to change Pluto's status as a planet.<ref>{{cite web | year=1999 | title=The Status of Pluto:A clarification | work=[[International Astronomical Union]], Press release | url=http://www.iau.org/STATUS_OF_PLUTO.238.0.html | accessdate=2006-05-25}}</ref><ref> {{cite web | year=1999 | author=Witzgall, Bonnie B. | title=Saving Planet Pluto | work= Amateur Astronomer article| url=http://www.asterism.org/newsletter/l9904-3.htm | accessdate=2006-05-25}} </ref>

The discovery of several other [[trans-Neptunian object]]s approaching the size of Pluto, such as [[50000 Quaoar|Quaoar]] and [[90377 Sedna|Sedna]], continued to erode arguments that Pluto was exceptional from the rest of the trans-Neptunian population. On [[July 29]], [[2005]], Mike Brown and his team announced the discovery of an object confirmed to be larger than Pluto,<ref>{{cite web | year=2006 | author=Brown, Mike | title=The discovery of 2003 UB313, the 10th planet.| work= California Institute of Technology| url=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/planetlila/ | accessdate=2006-05-25}} </ref> named [[136199 Eris|Eris]].<ref> {{cite web | year=2005 | author=M.

Although its discoverers (and many in the news media) immediately referred to it as the [[tenth planet]], it is officially designated as a [[dwarf planet]] - although the [[Minor Planet Center]] has given it a full minor planet designation: 136199 Eris.

==IAU debate==
{{main|2006 redefinition of planet}}
[[Image:NewSolarSystem2.jpg|thumb|right|420px|The eight [[Planet|Planets]] and three [[Dwarf Planet|Dwarf Planets]] of the Solar System. ''(Sizes to scale.)'']]
The discovery of [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]] forced the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] to act on a definition. In October 2005, a group of 19 IAU members, which had already been working on a definition since the discovery of [[90377 Sedna|Sedna]] in 2003, narrowed their choices to a shortlist of three, using [[approval voting]]. The definitions were:

* A planet is any object in [[orbit]] around the [[Sun]] with a diameter greater than 2000&nbsp;km. ''(eleven votes in favour)''
* A planet is any object in orbit around the Sun whose shape is stable due to its own gravity. ''(eight votes in favour)''
* A planet is any object in orbit around the Sun that is dominant in its immediate neighborhood. ''(six votes in favour)''<ref>{{cite web | author=McKee, Maggie| year=2006 | title=Xena reignites a planet-sized debate | work=NewScientistSpace | url=http://www.newscientistspace.com/article.ns?id=dn8681| accessdate=2006-05-25}} </ref><ref>{{cite web | author=Croswell, Ken| year=2006 | title=The Tenth Planet's First Anniversary| url=http://kencroswell.com/TenthPlanetFirstAnniversary.html| accessdate=2006-05-25}} </ref>
Since no overall consensus could be reached, the committee decided to put these three definitions to a wider vote at the IAU General Assembly meeting in [[Prague]] in August 2006,<ref>{{cite web| year=2006 | title=Planet Definition| work=IAU | url=http://www.astronomy2006.com/planet-definition.php| accessdate=2006-08-14}} </ref> and on [[August 24]], the IAU put a final draft to a vote, which combined elements from two of the three proposals. It essentially created a medial classification between "planet" and "rock" (or, in the new parlance, "[[small solar system body]]"), called "[[dwarf planet]]" and placed [[Pluto]] among them.<ref>[http://astro.cas.cz/nuncius/nsiii_09.pdf IAU General Assembly Newspaper, 24 August 2006]</ref><ref>[http://www.iau2006.org/mirror/www.iau.org/iau0602/index.html Definitions as voted on]</ref> The vote was passed, though only 424 astronomers took part in the ballot. 
 
{{cquote|The IAU therefore resolves that planets and other bodies in our [[Solar System]], except [[natural satellite|satellites]], be defined into three distinct categories in the following way:''

(1) A "[[planet]]"<sup>1</sup> is a celestial body that:  (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] (nearly round) shape, and (c) has [[clearing the neighbourhood|cleared the neighbourhood]] around its orbit.

<sup>2</sup> An IAU process will be established to assign borderline objects into either "dwarf planet" and other categories.<br>
<sup>3</sup> These currently include most of the Solar System [[asteroid]]s, most [[Trans-Neptunian object|Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs)]], [[comet]]s, and other small bodies.

----

The IAU further resolves:

[[Pluto]] is a "dwarf planet" by the above definition and is recognized as the [[Pluto prototype|prototype]] of a new category of trans-Neptunian objects.}}

==Ongoing controversies==
Despite the IAU's declaration, a number of issues continue to be unresolved. The definition is seen by many as arbitrary and confusing, and a number of [[Pluto]]-as-planet proponents, in particular [[Alan Stern]], head of [[NASA|NASA's]] [[New Horizons]] mission to Pluto, have circulated a petition among astronomers to alter the definition. The claim is that, since less than 5 percent of astronomers voted for it, the decision was not representative of the entire astronomical community.<ref>{{cite web | year=2006 | author=Robert Roy Britt| title=Pluto demoted in highly controversial definition| work= Space.com| url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/060824_planet_definition.html| accessdate=2006-08-24}}and[http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/060831_planet_definition.html]</ref> Even with this controversy excluded, there remain several ambiguities in the definition. 

===Clearing the neighborhood===
{{main|Clearing the neighborhood}}
One of the main points at issue is the precise meaning of "cleared the neighborhood around its [[orbit]]". [[Alan Stern]] recently objected that "it is impossible and contrived to put a dividing line between [[dwarf planet]]s and planets," and that since neither [[Earth]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], nor [[Neptune]] have entirely cleared their regions of debris, none could properly be considered planets under the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] definition.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5283956.stm| title=Pluto vote 'hijacked' in revolt}}</ref> This would appear to contradict his earlier published work, in which he wrote, "we define an ''überplanet'' as a planetary body in orbit around a [[star]] that is dynamically important enough to have cleared its neighboring planetesimals ... And we define an ''unterplanet'' as one that has not been able to do so," and then a few paragraphs later, "our [[solar system]] clearly contains 8 überplanets and a far larger number of unterplanets, the largest of which are [[Pluto]] and [[Ceres (planet)|Ceres]]."<ref name="Stern 2002">{{cite journal | last=Stern | first=S. Alan | coauthors=and Levison, Harold F. | year=2002 | title=Regarding the criteria for planethood and proposed planetary classification schemes | url=http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~hal/PDF/planet_def.pdf | format=[[PDF]] | journal=Highlights of Astronomy| volume=12 | pages=205-213, as presented at the XXIVth General Assembly of the IAU - 2000 [Manchester, UK, 7 - 18 August 2000]}}</ref>

In his article on the subject, [[Steven Soter]] gives one possible explanation. Essentially, "clearing the neighborhood" is [[Michael E. Brown|Mike Brown's]] definition by mass dominance: if an orbiting body is more than a hundred times more massive than the remaining collective mass in its "orbital zone", then it is a planet. Two bodies can be said to occupy the same "orbital zone" if their orbits cross a common distance from the star, or "primary", and their orbital periods differ less than an order of magnitude. In other words, if two bodies occupy the same distance from a star at one point in their orbits, and those orbits are similar, rather than, as a [[comet|comet's]] would be, extending for several times the other's distance, then they are in the same orbital zone.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://arxiv.org/ftp/astro-ph/papers/0608/0608359.pdf| format=PDF| title= What is a Planet?| first=Steven| last=Soter| date=2006-08-16| accessdate=2006-08-24}} submitted to The Astronomical Journal, [[16 August]] [[2006]]</ref>

Assuming this definition of "neighborhood" is the one ultimately accepted by the IAU, it is still an ambiguous concept. Mark Sykes, director of the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona and organiser of the petition, explained the ambiguity to [[National Public Radio]]. Since the definition does not categorise a planet by composition or formation, but, effectively, by its location, a Mars-sized or larger object beyond the orbit of Pluto would be considered a dwarf planet, since it would not have time to clear its orbit and would therefore be surrounded by objects of similar mass, whereas an object smaller than Pluto orbiting in isolation would be considered a planet.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5788798| format=RealPlayer| title= Astronomers Prepare to Fight Pluto Demotion| first=Sykes| last=Mark| date=2006-09-08| accessdate=2006-10-04}} </ref>

===Hydrostatic equilibrium===
[[Image:Vesta-HST.jpg|thumb|The asteroid [[4 Vesta|Vesta]] illustrates the broad boundary between "irregular" & "[[spheroid]]".]]
The [[International Astronomical Union|IAU's]] definition mandates that planets be large enough for their own [[gravity]] to form them into a state of [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]; this means that they will reach a shape that is, if not spherical, then [[Spheroid|spheroidal]]. This distinction, as opposed to strict sphericity, is mandated by the fact that many large objects in the [[Solar System]], such the planets [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]], the moons [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]], [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]] and [[Miranda (moon)|Miranda]], and the [[Kuiper belt object]] [[2003 EL61]],<ref> {{cite web| author= Brown, Michael E.| title=2003EL61| work= California Institute of Technology| url=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/2003EL61| accessdate=2006-05-25}} </ref> have been distorted into oblate or prolate spheroids by rapid rotation or [[tidal force]]s. However, deciding which objects in the solar system are spheroid is more complicated than it seems. In mathematical terms, spheroids consist of an ellipse rotated around one axis. Consequently they have two axes of equal length and one that is either longer or shorter; they resemble spheres that have been deformed (by stretching or squashing) in one dimension. A section through one axis will produce a circle, and a section through the other two axes will produce an ellipse.<ref> {{cite web| author=Calvert, J. V.| title=Mathematical Index: Ellipse| work= University of Denver| url=http://www.du.edu/~jcalvert/math/ellipse.htm| accessdate=2006-10-04}} </ref>

All spheroids, however, have the points on their surfaces joined by smooth curves (which form the elliptical or circular sections). On a topographically irregular body this can only be an approximation; however, taking such irregularity into account, a definite contrast exists between bodies, such as Enceladus, which are essentially spheroidal, and ''irregular'' bodies, like [[Neptune|Neptune's]] moon [[Proteus (moon)|Proteus]], whose [[limb]]s do not show smooth curvature.<ref> {{cite web | year=2006 | author=Thomas, P.

If one uses this mathematical basis to define a spheroid, then the boundary between spheroidal and irregular objects within the solar system frays noticeably, as this table illustrates:

Plainly, there is no clear mass or size boundary dividing those objects in the solar system which could be considered "spheroids" and those which are obviously irregular. The irregular objects [[2 Pallas|Pallas]], [[10 Hygeia|Hygeia]] and Proteus are all larger than regular objects, such as Miranda and Mimas. Also, as demonstrated by the dimensions listed in the table, the term "spheroid" is, in any case, fairly loose. [[4 Vesta|Vesta]], by the above formulation, could be considered either a spheroid or irregular. (see image)

Also, there is no one point at which an object can be said to have reached hydrostatic equilibrium. Objects made of ices, such as Enceladus and Miranda, assume that state more easily than those made of rock, such as Vesta and Pallas. Heat energy, from [[gravitational collapse]], [[impact event|impacts]], tidal forces, or [[radioactive decay]] also factors into whether an object will be spherical or not; Saturn's icy moon Mimas is spheroidal, but Neptune's larger moon Proteus, which is similarly composed but colder because of its greater distance from the Sun, is irregular.

===Double planets===
{{main|Double planet}}
[[Image:pluto and charon.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[telescope|telescopic]] image of [[Pluto]] and [[Charon (moon)|Charon]].]]

The definition specifically excludes [[natural satellite|satellites]] from the category of [[dwarf planet]], though it does not directly define the term "satellite". In the original draft proposal, an exception was made for [[Pluto]] and its largest satellite, [[Charon (moon)|Charon]], which possess a [[barycenter]]  outside the volume of either body. The initial proposal classified Pluto/Charon as a double planet, with the two objects orbiting the [[Sun]] in tandem. However, the final draft made clear that, double or not, both Pluto and Charon would be considered dwarf planets, not planets. 
	
Under the same definition, the [[Earth]]-[[Moon]] system is not formally recognized as a double planet, despite the Moon's large relative size, since the barycenter lies within the Earth. As the Moon is slowly [[Orbit of the Moon#Tidal evolution of the lunar orbit|receding from the Earth]], the Earth-Moon system may eventually become a double planet system on the basis of this barycentric definition.
 
Also, many moons, even those that do not orbit the Sun directly, often exhibit features in common with true planets. Jupiter's moon [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] and Saturn's moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] are both larger in terms of diameter (though not mass) than [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], and Titan even has a substantial atmosphere, thicker than the Earth's. Moons such as [[Io (moon)|Io]] and [[Triton (moon)|Triton]] demonstrate obvious and ongoing geological activity, and Ganymede has a [[magnetic field]].

It could be argued that, just as [[star]]s in orbit around other stars are still referred to as stars, thus objects in orbit around planets that share all their characteristics could also be called planets.

===Extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs===
{{main|Extrasolar planet|Brown dwarf}}
The [[International Astronomical Union|IAU's]] definition of planet applies only to objects within our own [[solar system]]. The more than 200 extrasolar planets (planet-sized objects in [[orbit]] around other [[star]]s) were excluded as too complex an issue to be resolved during the congress. However, any future definition will need to include them, as their discovery has widened the debate on the nature of planethood in unexpected ways. Many of these planets are of considerable size, approaching the mass of small stars, while many newly-discovered brown dwarfs are conversely small enough to be considered planets.<ref>{{cite web| year=2006 | title=IAU General Assembly: Definition of Planet debate| url=http://astro2006.meta.mediastream.cz/Astro2006-060822-01.asx

Traditionally, the defining characteristic for starhood has been an object's ability to [[Nuclear fusion|fuse]] [[hydrogen]] in its core. However, stars such as brown dwarfs have always challenged that distinction. Too small to commence sustained hydrogen fusion, they have been granted star status on their ability to fuse [[deuterium]]. However, due to the relative rarity of that [[isotope]], this process lasts only a tiny fraction of the star's lifetime, and hence most brown dwarfs would have ceased fusion long before their discovery.<ref> {{cite web | author=Basri, Gibor | title=What is a planet?| work= Astronomy Dept., UC Berkeley| url=http://astron.berkeley.edu/~basri/defineplanet/whatsaplanet.htm | accessdate=2006-05-25}} </ref> [[Binary star]]s and other multiple-star formations are common, and many brown dwarfs orbit other stars. Therefore, since they do not produce energy through fusion, they could be described as planets. Indeed, astronomer [[Adam Burrows]] of the [[University of Arizona]] claims that "from the theoretical perspective, however different their modes of formation, extrasolar giant planets and brown dwarfs are essentially the same."<ref>{{cite web | author=Burrows, Adam, Hubbard, W.B., Lunine, J., Leibert, James | year=2001 | title=The Theory of Brown Dwarfs and Extrasolar Giant Planets| work=Department of Astronomy and Steward Observatory, and Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, The University of Arizona| url=http://zenith.as.arizona.edu/~burrows/papers/rmp/RMP-final.pdf
| accessdate=2006-06-09}} </ref> Similarly, an orbiting [[white dwarf]], such as [[Sirius B]], since it too has ceased fusion, could be considered a planet. However, the current convention among astronomers is that any object massive enough to have possessed the capability to fuse during its lifetime should be considered a star.<ref> {{cite book | author=Croswell, Ken | year=1999 | title=Planet Quest: The Epic Discovery of Alien Solar Systems| publisher= Oxford University Press p. 119 (ISBN 0-19-288083-7)}}</ref>

The confusion does not end with brown dwarfs. Maria Rosa Zapatario-Osorio et al. have discovered many objects in young [[star cluster]]s of masses below that required to sustain fusion of any sort (currently calculated to be roughly 13 Jupiter masses).<ref> {{cite web |year= 2000| author= Zapatero M. R. Osorio, V. J. S. Béjar, E. L. Martín, R. Rebolo, D. Barrado y Navascués, C. A. L. Bailer-Jones, R. Mundt  | title=Discovery of Young, Isolated Planetary Mass Objects in the Sigma Orionis Star Cluster| work= Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences, California Institute of Technology| url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/290/5489/103 | accessdate=2006-05-25}} </ref> These have been described as "[[interstellar planet|free floating planets]]" because current theories of solar system formation suggest that planets may be ejected from solar systems altogether if their orbits become unstable. One could therefore argue that the original criterion that a planet must orbit a star should instead be amended to indicate that it must have ''originated'' in orbit around a star. This, however, would make large captured satellites such as [[Neptune|Neptune's]] [[Triton (moon)|Triton]] into planets.

[[Image:Cha110913.jpg|thumb|300 px|The solitary [[sub-brown dwarf]] [[Cha 110913-773444]] (middle), the least massive [[brown dwarf]] yet found, set to scale against the [[Sun]] (left) and the planet [[Jupiter]] (right).]]
However, it is also possible that these "free floating planets" could have formed in the same manner as stars.<ref>{{cite web |year= 2000| title=Rogue planet find makes astronomers ponder theory| work=Reuters| url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/TECH/space/10/06/space.planets.reut/| accessdate=2006-05-25}} </ref>  The material difference between a low-mass star and a large [[gas giant]] is not clearcut; apart from size and relative temperature, there is little to separate a gas giant like [[Jupiter]] from its host star. Both have similar overall compositions: hydrogen and [[helium]], with trace levels of heavier [[element]]s in their [[atmosphere]]s. The generally accepted difference is one of formation; stars are said to have formed from the "top down"; out of the gases in a nebula as they underwent gravitational collapse, and thus would be composed almost entirely of hydrogen and helium, while planets are said to have formed from the "bottom up"; from the accretion of dust and gas in orbit around the young star, and thus should have cores of [[silicate]]s or ices.<ref> {{cite web |year= 2004| author=G. Wuchterl| title=Giant planet formation| work=Institut für Astronomie der Universität Wien| url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/j6357423q7324013/| accessdate=2006-10-04}} </ref> As yet it is uncertain whether gas giants possess such cores. If it is indeed possible that a gas giant could form as a star does, then it raises the question of whether such an object, even one as familiar as Jupiter or Saturn, should be considered an orbiting low-mass star rather than a planet. 

In 2003, the IAU officially released a statement<ref>{{cite web |year= 2001| title=WORKING GROUP ON EXTRASOLAR PLANETS (WGESP) OF THE INTERNATIONAL ASTRONOMICAL UNION| work=[[IAU]]| url=http://www.dtm.ciw.edu/boss/definition.html| accessdate=2006-05-25}} </ref> to define what constitutes an extrasolar planet and what constitutes an orbiting star. To date, it remains the only official decision reached by the IAU on this issue.
{{cquote|
#Objects with true masses below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium (currently calculated to be 13 Jupiter masses for objects of solar metallicity) that orbit stars or stellar remnants are "planets" (no matter how they formed). The minimum mass/size required for an extrasolar object to be considered a planet should be the same as that used in our Solar System.
#Substellar objects with true masses above the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium are "brown dwarfs", no matter how they formed nor where they are located.
#Free-floating objects in young star clusters with masses below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium are not "planets", but are "[[sub-brown dwarfs]]" (or whatever name is most appropriate).}}

Like defining a "[[minor planet]]" by [[clearing the neighborhood|clearing its neighbourhood]], this definition creates ambiguity by making location, rather than formation or composition, the determining characteristic for planethood. A free-floating object with a mass below 13 Jupiter masses is a "sub-brown dwarf," whereas such an object in orbit round a fusing star is a planet, even if, in all other respects, the two objects may be identical. This ambiguity was highlighted in December 2005, when the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] observed [[Cha 110913-773444]], the least massive brown dwarf yet found, only eight times Jupiter's mass with what appears to be the beginnings of its own [[star system]]. Were this object found in orbit round another star, it would have been termed a planet.<ref>{{cite web |year= 2005| author= Clavin, Whitney| title=A Planet With Planets?

===Semantics===
Finally, from a purely linguistic point of view, there is the dichotomy that the IAU created between 'planet' and 'dwarf planet'. The term 'dwarf planet' arguably contains two words, a noun (planet) and an adjective (dwarf). Thus, the term could suggest that a dwarf planet is a type of planet, even though the IAU explicitly defines a dwarf planet as ''not'' so being. Arguably, this can confuse people. This is met by the observation that, if so, the term 'minor planets' (which are also not planets) would share the same difficulties, although this term has been in use for many years, and that therefore 'dwarf planet' (and 'minor planet') is best considered as being a [[compound noun]]. Benjamin Zimmer, of [http://www.languagelog.org languagelog.org], summarised the confusion: "The fact that the IAU would like us to think of dwarf planets as distinct from 'real' planets lumps the lexical item 'dwarf planet' in with such oddities as 'Welsh rabbit' [sic] (not really a rabbit) and 'Rocky Mountain oysters' (not really oysters)."<ref>{{cite web|author= Nathan Bierma|title=New confusion as definition spins out of control| work=Chicago Tribune| url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/chi-0609050383sep06,1,6078637.story?ctrack=1&cset=true| accessdate=2006-10-04}}</ref> As [[Dava Sobel]], historian and popular science writer who participated in the IAU's initial decision in October 2006, noted in an interview with [[National Public Radio]], "A dwarf planet is not a planet, and in astronomy, there are dwarf stars, which are stars, and dwarf galaxies, which are galaxies, so ["dwarf planet" is] a term no one can love."<ref>{{cite web|title=A Travel Guide to the Solar System|year=2006|work=National Public Radio|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/dmg/dmg_wmref.php?prgCode=TOTN&showDate=27-Oct-2006&segNum=4&mediaPref=WM&sauid=U980048701163643238937&getUnderwriting=1|accessdate=2006-11-18}}</ref>
