A '''rainbow flag''' is a multi-colored flag consisting of stripes in the colors of the [[rainbow]]. Not all, however, use the actual [[Color#Physics of color|basic colors]] red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue and violet, nor the [[Rainbow#Remembering the sequence of colours|traditional rainbow colors]] of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.

The use of rainbow flags has a long tradition; they are displayed in many cultures around the world as a sign of diversity and inclusiveness, of hope and of yearning. This denotation goes back to the rainbow as a symbol of biblical promise when [[God]] gave the sign to [[Noah]] that there would never be a flood like the one that happened then ever again. The use of all the colors of the rainbow symbolizes all flags of gay people.

Already in the German [[Peasants' War]] of the 16th century, the rainbow flag together with the peasants' boot ("Bundschuh") was used as the sign of a new era, of hope and of social change.

The reformer [[Thomas Müntzer]]  connected  socially revolutionary claims with his preaching of the gospel. He is often portrayed with a rainbow flag in his hand. The [[Thomas Müntzer]] statue in the German town of Stolberg also shows him holding a rainbow flag in his hand.

There are several, unrelated rainbow flags in use today, with the flag of the [[Rainbow family]] being an obvious example. The most widely known is perhaps the flag representing [[gay pride]]. The [[peace]] flag is especially popular in [[Italy]] and the [[Cooperatives]] Co-op flag symbolizes international co-operation. There are also other, less well known rainbow flags as well as other flags of a similar design but different purpose (such as the [[European flag#Proposals|European flag]] "barcode" style).

The rainbow flag, sometimes called 'the freedom flag', has been used as a symbol of [[gay]] and [[lesbian]] pride since the [[1970s]]. The different colors symbolize diversity in the [[gay community]],  and the flag is often used as a symbol of gay pride in gay rights marches. It originated in the [[United States]], but is now used around the world.

The rainbow flag was first used to symbolize gay pride and diversity by [[San Francisco]] artist Gilbert Baker; as of 2006, it currently consists of six colored stripes of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. It is most commonly flown with the red stripe on top, as the colors appear in a natural rainbow.

===History===

There was some use of similar multi-colored flags in the USA in the early [[1970s]] as a symbol of internationalism and unity of all people of Earth, but by the end of the 1970s the rainbow flag's connection with [[gay pride]] became generally known in the United States.

The original gay-pride flag was hand-dyed by Baker.  It first flew in the San Francisco Gay Freedom Day Parade on [[June 25]], [[1978]], by Justin Fox, the lead singer of Last Blue Film.  The flag consisted of eight stripes; Baker assigned specific meaning to each of the colors as follows:
* '''hot pink''' - sexuality
* '''red''' - life
* '''orange''' - healing
* '''yellow''' - sunlight
* '''green''' - nature
* '''turquoise''' - magic
* '''blue''' - serenity
* '''violet''' - spirit

After the [[November 27]],[[1978]] assassination of openly gay City Supervisor [[Harvey Milk]], demand for the rainbow flag greatly increased.  To meet demand, the Paramount Flag Company began selling a version of the flag using stock rainbow fabric consisting of seven stripes of red, orange, yellow, green, turquoise, blue, and violet.  As Baker ramped up production of his version of the flag, he too dropped the hot pink stripe due to the unavailability of hot-pink fabric. Also, San Francisco-based Paramount Flag Co. began selling a surplus stock of [[International Order of the Rainbow for Girls|Rainbow Girls]] flags from its Polk Street retail store, which was located in a large gay neighborhood.
[[Image:DavieVillage-1.png|left|thumb|[[Davie Village]] banners on Davie Street in [[Vancouver]]]]
In [[1979]], the flag was modified again.  When hung vertically from the lamp posts of San Francisco's [[Market Street]], the center stripe was obscured by the post itself.  Changing the flag design to one with an even number of stripes was the easiest way to rectify this, so the turquoise stripe was dropped, which resulted in a six stripe version of the flag - red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet.

In [[1989]], the rainbow flag came to nationwide attention in America after John Stout sued his landlords and won when they attempted to prohibit him from displaying the flag from his [[West Hollywood]], [[California]] apartment balcony.

[[Image:We the People Say No to the Bush Agenda by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Rainbow flag as a form of protest]]The rainbow flag celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2003.  During the gay pride celebrations in June of that year, Gilbert Baker restored the rainbow flag back to its original eight-striped version and has since advocated that others do the same. However the eight-striped version has seen little adoption by the wider gay community, which has mostly stuck with the better known six-striped version.

In autumn [[2004]] several gay businesses in [[London]] were ordered by [[City of Westminster|Westminster City Council]] to remove the rainbow flag from their premises, as its display required planning permission. When one shop applied for permission, the Planning sub-committee refused the application on the chair's casting vote ([[May 19]], [[2005]]), a decision condemned by gay councillors in Westminster and the Mayor of London, [[Ken Livingstone]]. In November the council announced a reversal of policy, stating that most shops and bars would be allowed to fly the rainbow flag without planning permission.

Today many homosexuals and supporters of gay rights often put rainbow flags in the front of their yards and/or front doors, or use rainbow [[bumper stickers]] on their vehicles to use as an outward symbol of their homosexuality or support.

On the 14th of June 2004, gay activists sailed to Australia's uninhabited Coral Sea Islands Territory and raised the Gay flag, proclaiming the territory independent of Australia.  See also [[Gay and Lesbian Kingdom of the Coral Sea Islands]].

===Variations===
Many variations of the rainbow flag have been used. Some of the more common ones include a Greek letter λ (lambda) in white in the middle of the flag and a [[pink triangle]] or [[Black triangle (badge)|black triangle]] in the upper left corner. Other colors have been added, such as a black stripe symbolising those community members lost to [[AIDS]]. The rainbow colors have also often been used in gay alterations of national and regional flags, replacing for example the red and white stripes of the [[flag of the United States]].

===Rainbow colors as symbol of gay pride===

The basic rainbow flag has spawned innumerable variations. One common item of jewelry is the ''pride necklace'' or ''freedom rings'', consisting of six rings, one of each color, on a chain. Other variants range from key chains to candles. 

In [[Montreal|Montréal]], [[Beaudry (Montreal Metro)|Beaudry]] metro station, which serves that city's [[Village gai]], was recently rebuilt with rainbow-colored elements integrated into its design.

This rainbow flag in [[Italy]] was first used in a peace march in [[1961]], inspired by similar multi-colored flags used in demonstrations against [[nuclear weapon]]s. It became popular with the ''Pace da tutti i balconi'' ("peace from every balcony") campaign in [[2002]], started as a protest against the impending [[war in Iraq]]. The most common variety has seven colors, purple, blue, [[azure (color)|azure]], green, yellow, orange and red, and is emblazoned in bold with the Italian word ''PACE'', meaning "peace".

Common variations include moving the purple stripe down below the azure one, and adding a white stripe on top (the original flag from the 60s had a white stripe on top). This flag has been adopted internationally as a symbol of the [[peace movement]].

==Cooperative movement==
{{Unreferencedsect|date=February 2007}}
===History and use===
A seven-color rainbow flag is a common symbol of the international [[Cooperative]] movement. The rainbow flag has been the co-operative emblem since 1921 when the International Co-operative Congress of World Co-op Leaders met in Basel, Switzerland to identify and define the growing co-operative movement’s common values and ideals to help unite co-ops around the world.

In Essen, Germany in 1922, the [[International Co-operative Alliance]] (ICA) designed an international co-op symbol and a flag for the first "Co-operators' Day," which was held in July 1923. After some experiments with different designs, a famous French co-operator, Professor [[Charles Gide]], suggested using the seven colors of the rainbow for the flag. He pointed out that the rainbow symbolized unity in diversity and the power of light, enlightenment and progress. The first co-op rainbow flag was completed in 1924 and was adopted as an official symbol of the international co-operative movement in 1925.

The ICA has been flying a flag with its official logo since April 2001, when its Board decided to replace the traditional rainbow flag. Its use by a number of non-cooperative groups led to confusion in several countries around the world. The ICA's official flag was changed to clearly promote and strengthen the co-operative image, but still uses the rainbow image.  Other organizations sometimes use the traditional rainbow flag as a symbol of co-operation.
===Meaning of the colors===
Like the [[rainbow]], this flag is a symbol of hope and peace. The seven colors from flags around the world fly in harmony. Each of the seven colors in the co-operative flag have been assigned the following meaning:

* '''red''' stands for courage;
* '''orange''' offers the vision of possibilities;
* '''yellow''' represents the challenge that GREEN has kindled;
* '''green''' indicates a challenge to co-operators to strive for growth of membership and of understanding of the aims and values of co-operation;
* '''sky blue''' suggests far horizons, the need to provide education and help less fortunate people and strive toward global unity.
* '''dark blue''' suggests pessimism: a reminder that less fortunate people have needs that may be met through the benefits of co-operation;
* '''violet''' represents warmth, beauty, and friendship.

== Andean peoples and social movements ==
'''The andean ''Whipala'''''

A flag with a seven-striped rainbow design is used in [[Peru]]<ref>http://flagspot.net/flags/xi.html</ref> and [[Ecuador]] to represent [[Inca Empire|Tawantin Suyu]], or Inca territory. The use of the flag has its origin in Inca culture and it is called whipala. Even today in the city of Cuzco, Peru it is common to see the flag around the city displayed even in government buildings and in Cuzco main square. The meaning behind the whipala has to be found in connection with the Incas and with the cosmovision and philosophy of Andean indigenous culture. [http://revista.serindigena.cl/props/public_html/?module=displaystory&story_id=813&format=html]
It celebrates the order of the cosmos and it is a symbol for life and fertility. 

Unlike the gay pride flag, the Tawantinsuyu flag uses light blue instead of turquoise. Some have suggested adopting a new flag to avoid confusion with the gay pride flag. There is also a version that has a white stripe between the yellow and green stripes, and a light blue stripe is not used.

'''The ''whipala'' and social movements in Ecuador and Peru'''

Today in Ecuador, it is readily identified with the Indian Social movement mainly represented by CONAIE (Ecuadorian Confederation of Indian nationalities). This organization has had an important role in massive protests in the late 90s and 2000s which have brought down 3 presidents perceived as corrupt and responsible for the empoverishment of Ecuadorians. The flag of CONAIE is a whipala with a mask in the middle from a preinca Ecuadorian coastal peoples known as La Tolita. 

The flag is displayed by marches of the CONAIE movement and also it is used by its political faction the Pachakutik Movement (Movimiento de Unidad Plurinacional Pachakutik) which participates in elections and has a considerable legislative representation. The concept of pachakutik, which is a Quechua or quichua word, is related with the vision and the hope of a better tomorrow for Andean people. The MUPP was formed in the 90s mainly by an alliance of the CONAIE with peasant organizations and urban social movements. Because of this fact, the whipala is celebrated also by urban social movements as a symbol of diversity and protection of the lives and dignity of the Ecuadorian people and it also finds sympathy in local LGBT, feminist and afroecuadorian circles and activists. Ecuador is a diverse country of many climates, languages and ethnicities and also a country blessed with fertile lands and the whipala there also constitutes a celebration of all these.

The rainbow whipala is also displayed is marches of indigenous and peasant movements in Peru.
