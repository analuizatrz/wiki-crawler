{{Campaignbox First Indochina War}}

The '''Battle of Dien Bien Phu''' ([[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]: ''Chiến dịch Điện Biên Phủ'') was the last major battle in the [[First Indochina War]] between the military forces of France and Vietnamese revolutionary forces called the [[Viet Minh]]. The battle occurred between [[March]] and [[May]] [[1954]], and culminated in a massive French defeat that effectively ended the war. Dien Bien Phu was "the first time that a non-European colonial independence movement had evolved through all the stages from [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla bands]] to a conventionally organized and equipped army able to defeat a modern Western occupier in [[pitched battle]]."<ref>Quotation from Martin Windrow. Kenney, Michael. "British Historian Takes a Brilliant Look at French Fall in Vietnam".  ''[[Boston Globe]]'', January 4, 2005.</ref> 

As a result of blunders in the French decision making process, the French undertook to create an air-supplied base, at [[Dien Bien Phu]], deep in the hills of Vietnam. Its purpose was to cut off Viet Minh supply lines into the neighboring French colony of [[Laos]]. Instead, the Viet Minh, under General [[Vo Nguyen Giap]], surrounded and [[siege|besieged]] the French, who were ignorant of the Viet Minh's possession of heavy artillery and their ability to move such weapons to the mountain crests overlooking the French encampment. The Viet Minh occupied the highlands around Dien Bien Phu, and were able to fire down accurately onto French positions. Tenacious fighting on the ground ensued, reminiscent of the [[trench warfare]] of [[World War I]]. The French repeatedly repulsed Viet Minh assaults on their positions. Supplies and reinforcements were supplied by air, although as the French positions were overrun, fewer and fewer of those supplies reached them. After a two month siege, the garrison was overrun and most French surrendered. Despite the loss of most of their best soldiers, the Viet Minh marshalled their remaining forces and pursued the French who did flee into the wilderness, routing them and ending the battle.

Following the battle, the war ended with the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|1954 Geneva accords]]. The accords partitioned the country in two; fighting later resumed in 1957 with the [[Vietnam War]] (Second [[Indochina Wars|Indochina War]]).

==Background and preparations==
By 1953, the [[First Indochina War]] was not going well for the French. A succession of commanders – [[Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque]], [[Jean-Étienne Valluy]], [[Thierry d'Argenlieu]], [[Jean de Lattre de Tassigny]], and [[Raoul Salan]] – had proven incapable of suppressing the Viet Minh insurrection. During their 1952–53 campaign, the Viet Minh had overrun vast swaths of the French colony of [[Laos]], Vietnam's western neighbor. The French were unable to slow the Viet Minh advance, and the Viet Minh fell back only after outrunning their always-tenuous supply lines. In 1953, the French had begun to strengthen their defenses in the [[Hanoi]] delta region to prepare for a series of offenses against Viet Minh [[staging area]]s in northwest Vietnam. They had set up fortified towns and outposts in the area, including [[Lai Chau]] near the Chinese border to the north,<ref>Fall, 23</ref> [[Nan Sanh]] to the west of Hanoi,<ref>Fall, 9</ref> and the [[Plain of Jars]] in northern Laos.<ref>Fall, 48</ref>

In May 1953, French Premier [[Rene Mayer]] appointed [[Henri Navarre]], a trusted colleague, to take command of French Forces in Indochina. Mayer had given Navarre a single order – to create military conditions that would lead to an "honorable political solution."<ref name="d165">Davidson, 165</ref> On arrival, Navarre was shocked by what he found. "There had been no long-range plan since de Lattre's departure. Everything was conducted on a day-to-day, reactive basis. Combat operations were undertaken only in response to enemy moves or threats. There was no comprehensive plan to develop the organization and build up the equipment of the Expeditionary force. Finally, Navarre, the intellectual, the cold and professional soldier, was shocked by the 'school's out' attitude of Salan and his senior commanders and staff officers. They were going home, not as victors or heroes, but then, not as clear losers either. To them the important thing was that they were getting out of Indochina with their reputations frayed, but intact. They gave little thought to, or concern for, the problems of their successors."<ref name="d165"/>

===Defense of Laos===
[[Image:LocationVietnamDienBien.png|right|thumbnail|200px|Dien Bien Phu, in [[Dien Bien Province]] (shown in green) was sufficiently far from Hanoi, the seat of French military power, that French air transport could not easily keep it supplied]]

The most controversial issue surrounding the battle was whether Navarre was also obligated to defend Laos, which was far from the French seat of military power in [[Hanoi]]. Although Navarre assumed it was his responsibility, defending it would require his army to operate far from its home base. During meetings with the [[National Defense Committee (France)|France's National Defense Committee]] on [[July 17]] and [[July 24]], Navarre asked if he was responsible for defending northern Laos.<ref name="d176">Davidson, 176</ref> These meetings produced a misunderstanding that became the most disputed fact of the controversy surrounding the battle. For years afterwards, Navarre insisted the committee had reached no consensus; French Premier [[Joseph Laniel]] insisted that, at that meeting, the Committee had instructed Navarre to abandon Laos if necessary. "On this key issue, the evidence supports Navarre's claim that on [[July 24]], he was given no clear-cut decision regarding his responsibility for Laos. Over the years, when challenged by Navarre, Laniel has never been able to present any written evidence to support his contention that Navarre was instructed to abandon Laos if necessary."<ref name="d176"/> The committee was reluctant to give Navarre a definitive answer because its proceedings were constantly leaked to the press, and the politicians on the committee did not want to take a politically damaging position on the issue.<ref name="d176"/>

===Nan Sanh and the hedgehog concept===
Simultaneously, Navarre had been searching for a way to stop the Viet Minh threat to Laos. Colonel Louis Berteil, commander of Mobile Group 7 and Navarre's main planner,<ref>Fall, 44</ref> formulated the "herisson" ([[hedgehog]]) concept. The French army would establish a fortified [[airhead]] by air-lifting soldiers adjacent to a key Viet Minh supply line to Laos.<ref>Davidson, 173</ref> This would effectively cut off Viet Minh soldiers fighting in Laos and force them to withdraw. 

The hedgehog concept was based on French experiences at the [[Battle of Nan Sanh]]. In late November and early December 1952, Giap attacked the French outpost at Nan Sanh. Nan Sanh was essentially an "air-land base", a fortified camp supplied only by air.<ref>Fall, 24</ref> Giap's forces were beaten back repeatedly with very heavy losses. The French hoped that by repeating the setup on a larger scale, they would be able to bait Giap into committing the bulk of his forces in a massed assault. This would enable superior French artillery, armor, and air support to wipe out the exposed Viet Minh forces. The experience at Nan Sanh convinced Navarre of the viability of the fortified airhead concept.

However, French staff officers failed to take into consideration several important differences between Dien Bien Phu and Nan Sanh. First, at Nan Sanh, the French commanded most of the high ground with overwhelming artillery support.<ref>Davidson, 147</ref> At Dien Bien Phu, however, the Viet Minh controlled much of the high ground around the valley and their artillery far exceeded French expectations and outnumbered the French by a ratio of four-to-one.<ref name="d224"/> Giap compared Dien Bien Phu to a "rice bowl", where his troops occupied the edge and the French the bottom. Second, Giap made a mistake in Nan Sanh by committing his forces into reckless frontal attacks before preparations could be made. At Dien Bien Phu, Giap would spend months stockpiling ammunitions and emplacing heavy artillery and anti-aircraft guns before making his move. Teams of Viet Minh volunteers were sent into the French camp to note the disposition of the French artillery. Wooden artillery pieces were built for camouflage and the real guns were rotated every few salvos to confuse French counterbattery fire. As a result, when the battle began, the Viet Minh knew exactly where the French artillery were while the French were not even aware of how many guns Giap possessed. Third, the aerial resupply lines at Nan Sanh were never severed despite Viet Minh anti-aircraft fire. At Dien Bien Phu, Giap amassed anti-aircraft batteries that quickly shut down the runway and made it extremely difficult and costly for the French to bring in reinforcements.

===Lead up to Castor===
In June, [[Major General]] [[René Cogny]], commander of the [[Tonkin]] Delta, had proposed Dien Bien Phu as a "mooring point".<ref>Davidson, 182</ref> In another misunderstanding, Cogny had envisioned a lightly defended point from which to launch raids; however, to Navarre, this meant a heavily fortified base capable of withstanding a siege. Navarre selected Dien Bien Phu for the location of Bertiel's "hedgehog". When presented with it, every major subordinate officer protested – Colonel [[Jean-Louis Nicot]], (commander of the French Air transport fleet), Cogny, and generals Jean Gilles and Jean Dechaux (the ground and air commanders for CASTOR, the initial airborne assault on Dien Bien Phu). Cogny pointed out, presciently, that "we are running the risk of a new Na San under worse conditions"<ref>Roy, 21</ref> Navarre rejected the criticisms of his proposal, and concluded a November 17 conference by declaring the operation would commence three days later, on [[November 20]], [[1953]].<ref>Roy, 33</ref><ref>Davidson, 184</ref>

Navarre decided to go ahead with the operation, despite operational difficulties which would later become obvious (but may at the time have been more concealed)<ref>''the last valley'', [[Martin Windrow]], [[2004]], p211, 212, 228, 275</ref> because he had been repeatedly assured by his intelligence officers that the operation had very little risk of involvement by a strong enemy force.<ref>Davidson, 189</ref> Navarre had previously considered three other ways to defend Laos: [[Mobile warfare]], which was impossible given the terrain in Vietnam; a [[static defense]] line stretching to Laos, which was inexecutable given the number of troops at Navarre's disposal; or placing troops in the Laotian capitals and supplying them by air, which was unworkable due to the distance from [[Hanoi]] to [[Luang Prabang]] and [[Vientiane]].<ref>Davidson, 186</ref> Thus, the only option left to Navarre was the hedgehog option, which he characterized as "a mediocre solution."<ref>Davidson, 187</ref>

In a sad twist of fate, the French National Defense Committee ultimately did agree that Navarre's responsibility did not include defending Laos. However, their decision (which was drawn up on [[November 13]]) was not delivered to him until [[December 4]], two weeks after the Dien Bien Phu operation began.<ref name="d176"/>

===Establishment of the airhead===
[[Image:Cogny Castries Navarre.jpg|right|thumbnail|300px|(seated left to right) [[René Cogny]] (holding the cane), [[Christian de Castries]] (hatless), and [[Henri Navarre]]]]

Operations at Dien Bien Phu began at 10:35 on the morning of [[November 20]], [[1953]]. In '''Operation Castor''', the French dropped or flew 9,000 troops into the area over three days. They were landed at three drop zones: Natasha, northwest of Dien Bien Phu; Octavie, southwest of Dien Bien Phu; and Simone, southeast of Dien Bien Phu.<ref>Davidson, 194</ref>

The Viet Minh elite 148th Independent Infantry Regiment, headquartered at Dien Bien Phu, reacted "instantly and effectively"; however, three of their four battalions were absent that day.<ref>Davidson, 193</ref> Initial operations proceeded well for the French. By the end of November, six parachute battalions had been landed and the French were consolidating their positions.

It was at this time that Giap began his counter-moves. Giap had expected an attack, but could not foresee when or where it would occur. Giap realized that, if pressed, the French would abandon [[Lai Chau Province]] and fight a [[pitched battle]] at Dien Bien Phu.<ref>Davidson, 196</ref> On [[November 24]], Giap ordered the 148th Infantry Regiment and the 316th division to attack into Lai Chau, and the 308th, 312th, and 351st divisions to attack from [[Viet Bac]] into Dien Bien Phu.<ref>Davidson, 196</ref>

Starting in December, the French, under the command of Colonel [[Christian de Castries]], started transforming their anchoring point into a fortress by setting up various strongpoints, each one (allegedly) named after a former de Castries mistress, although this is unlikely, as they also start with 7 of the first letters of the alphabet.  The center of the fortress had the headquarters with strongpoints "Huguette" to the west, "Claudine" to the south, and "Dominique" to the northeast.  Other strongpoints were "Anne-Marie" to the northwest, "Beatrice" to the northeast, "Gabrielle" to the north and "Isabelle" four miles to the south, covering the reserve airstrip. The choice of de Castries as the on-scene commander at Dien Bien Phu was, in retrospect, a bad one. Navarre had picked de Castries, a [[cavalry|cavalryman]] in the 18th century tradition,<ref name="time">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,860710,00.html The Fall of Dienbienphu], [[Time Magazine]], [[May 17]], [[1954]] edition</ref> because Navarre envisioned Dien Bien Phu as a mobile battle. In reality, Dien Bien Phu required someone adept at [[World War]] I-style [[static defense]], something for which de Castries was not suited.<ref>Davidson, 199</ref> 

The arrival of the 316th Viet Minh division prompted Cogny to order the evacuation of the Lai Chau garrison to Dien Bien Phu, exactly as Giap had anticipated. En route, they were virtually annihilated by the Viet Minh. "Of the 2,100 men who left Lai Chau on [[December 9]], only 185 made it to Dien Bien Phu on [[December 22]]. The rest had been killed or captured or [[desertion|deserted]]."<ref>Davidson, 203</ref> The Viet Minh troops now converged on Dien Bien Phu.

The French had committed 10,800 troops, with more reinforcements totaling nearly 16,000 men, to the defense of a monsoon-affected valley surrounded by heavily wooded hills that had not been secured. Artillery, as well as ten M-24 light tanks and numerous aircraft were committed to the garrison as well. The garrison comprised French regular troops (notably elite paratroop units plus artillery), Foreign Legionaires, Algerian and Moroccan [[tirailleur]]s, and locally recruited Indochinese infantry.  

All told, the Viet Minh had moved 50,000 regular troops into the hills surrounding the valley, totaling five divisions including the 351st Heavy Division made up entirely of heavy artillery.<ref name="d223"/> Artillery and AA guns, which outnumbered the French artillery by about four to one,<ref name="d223"/> were moved into camouflaged positions overlooking the valley. The French came under sporadic Viet Minh artillery fire for the first time on [[January 31]], [[1954]] and patrols encountered the Viet Minh in all directions. The battle had been joined, and the French were now surrounded.

==Combat operations==
[[Image:Dien Bein Phu map.png|right|thumbnail|250px|The French disposition at Dien Bien Phu, as of March 1954. The French took up positions on a series of fortified hills. The southernmost, Isabelle, was dangerously isolated. The Viet Minh positioned their 5 divisions (the 304th, 308th, 312th, 316th, and 351st) in the surrounding areas to the north and east. From these areas, the Viet Minh had a clear line of sight on the French fortifications and were able to accurately rain down artillery on the French positions.]]

===Beatrice===
The fighting began at 5:00 PM on [[March 13]] when the Viet Minh launched massive surprise artillery barrage. The time and date were carefully chosen – the hour allowed the artillery to fire in daylight, and the date was chosen because it was a [[new moon]], allowing a nighttime infantry attack.<ref>Davidson, 234</ref> The attack concentrated on strongpoints Beatrice, defended by a battalion from the [[French Foreign Legion]]. 

Unbeknown to the French, the Viet Minh had made very detailed study of Beatrice, and had practiced assaulting it using models. According to one Viet Minh major: "Every evening, we came up and took the opportunity to cut barbed wire and remove mines. Our jumping-off point was moved up to only two hundred yards from the peaks of Beatrice, and to our surprise [French] artillery didn't know where we were".<ref>Roy, 167</ref> 

The French command on Beatrice was decimated at 6:15 PM when a shell hit the French command post there, killing Legionnaire commander Major [[Paul Pegot]] and his entire staff. A few minutes later, Colonel [[Jules Gaucher]], commander of the entire northern sector, was killed by Viet Minh artillery. 

French resistance on Beatrice collapsed shortly after midnight following a fierce battle. Roughly 500 legionnaires were killed, along with 600 Viet Minh killed and 1,200 wounded from the 312th division.<ref name="d236">Davidson, 236</ref> The French launched a counterattack against Beatrice the following morning, but it was quickly beaten back by Viet Minh artillery. Despite their losses, the victory at Beatrice "galvanized the morale" of the Viet Minh troops.<ref name="d236"/> 

Much to French disbelief, the Viet Minh had employed direct artillery fire, where each gun crew does its own [[artillery spotting]] (as opposed to indirect fire, where guns are massed further away, out of direct line of sight, and rely on a forward artillery spotter). Indirect artillery, generally held as being far superior to direct fire, requires experienced, well-trained crews and good communications which the Viet Minh did not have.<ref>Davidson, 227</ref> Navarre wrote that "Under the influence of Chinese advisers, the Viet Minh commanders had used processes quite different from the classic methods. The artillery had been dug in by single pieces... They were installed in shell-proof dugouts, and fire point-blank from portholes... This way of using artillery and AA guns was possible only with the expansive ant holes at the disposal of the Vietminh and was to make shambles of all the estimates of our own artillerymen."<ref>Navarre, 225</ref> The French artillery commander, Colonel [[Charles Piroth|Piroth]], distraught at his inability to bring counterfire on the well-camouflaged Viet Minh batteries, went into his dugout and killed himself with a [[hand grenade]].<ref>{{cite web

</ref> He was buried there in great secrecy to prevent loss of morale among the French troops.

===Gabrielle===
Following a four hour cease fire on the morning of [[March 14]], Viet Minh artillery resumed pounding French positions. The air strip was put out of commission, forcing the French to deliver all supplies by parachute.<ref name="d237">Davidson, 237</ref> That night, the Viet Minh launched an attack on Gabrielle, held by an elite Algerian battalion. The attack began with a concentrated artillery barrage at 5:00 PM. Two [[regiments]] from the crack 308th division attacked starting at 8:00 PM. At 4:00 AM the following morning, a Viet Minh artillery shell hit the battalion headquarters, severely wounding the battalion commander and most of his staff.<ref name="d237"/>

Castries ordered a counterattack to relieve Gabrielle. However, Colonel [[Pierre Langlais]], in forming the counterattack, chose to rely on the 5th Vietnamese Parachute battalion, which had jumped in the day before and was exhausted.<ref name="d238">Davidson, 238</ref> Although some elements of the counterattack reached Gabrielle, most were paralyzed by the Viet Minh artillery and took heavy losses. At 8:00 AM the next day, the Algerian battalion fell back, abandoning Gabrielle to the Viet Minh. The French lost around 1,000 men defending Gabrielle, and the Viet Minh between 1,000 and 2,000.<ref name="d238"/>

===Anne-Marie===
Anne-Marie was defended by [[T'ai]]s, a Vietnamese ethnic minority loyal to the French. For weeks, Giap had distributed subversive [[propaganda]] leaflets, telling the T'ais that this was not their fight. The fall of Beatrice and Gabrielle had severely demoralized them. On the morning of [[March 17]], under a fog, the bulk of the T'ais left or defected. The French and few remaining T'ais on Anne-Marie were then forced to withdraw.<ref>Davidson, 239</ref>

===Lull===
[[March 17]] through [[March 30]] saw a lull in fighting. The Viet Minh encircled the French central area (formed by the strongpoints Hugette, Dominique, Claudine, and Eliane), effectively cutting off Isabelle and its 1,809 personnel.<ref>Fall, 279</ref> During this lull, the French suffered from a serious crisis of command. "It had become painfully evident to the senior officers within the encircled garrison – and even to Cogny at Hanoi – that Castries was incompetent to conduct the defense of Dien Bien Phu. Even more critical, after the fall of the northern outposts, he isolated himself in his bunker so that he had, in effect, relinquished his command authority."<ref name="d241">Davidson, 240-241</ref> On [[March 17]], Cogny attempted to fly into Dien Bien Phu and take command, but his plane was driven off by anti-aircraft fire. Cogny considered parachuting into the encircled garrison, but his staff talked him out of it.<ref name="d241"/> 

Castries' seclusion in his bunker, combined with his superiors' refusal to replace him, created a leadership vacuum within the French command. On [[March 24]], Colonel Langlais and his fellow paratroop commanders, all fully armed, confronted Castries. They told Castries that he would retain the appearance of command, but that Langlais would exercise it.<ref>Fall, 177</ref> Castries accepted the arrangement without protest, although he did exercise some command functions thereafter.<ref>Davidson, 243</ref>

The French aerial resupply was taking heavy losses from Viet Minh machine guns near the landing strip. On March 27, Hanoi air transport commander Nicot ordered that all supply deliveries be made from 6,500 feet or higher; losses were expected to remain heavy.<ref>Davidson, 244</ref> Castries ordered an attack against the Viet Minh machine guns two miles west of Dien Bien Phu. Surprisingly, the attack went totally according to plan, with 350 Viet Minh soldiers killed and seventeen AA machine guns destroyed. French losses were only twenty soldiers.<ref>Davidson, 244-245</ref>

===March 30–April 5 assaults===
[[Image:Dien Bien Phu zoom.svg|right|350px|thumbnail|The central French positions at Dien Bien Phu as of late March 1954. The positions in Eliane saw some of the most intense combat of the entire battle]]

The next phase of the battle saw more massed Viet Minh assaults against French positions in the central Dien Bien Phu area – Eliane and Dominique in particular. Those two areas were held by five understrength battalions, composed of a mixture of Frenchmen, Legionnaires, Vietnamese, Africans, and T'ais.<ref>Davidson, 245</ref> Giap planned to use the tactics from the Beatrice and Gabrielle skirmishes. 

At 7:00 PM on [[March 30]], the Viet Minh 312th division captured Dominique 1 and 2, making Dominique 3 the final outpost between the Viet Minh and the French general headquarters, as well as outflanking all of the position east of the river.<ref name="d246">Davidson, 246</ref> At this point, the French 4th colonial artillery regiment entered the fight, setting its 105 mm howitzers to zero elevation and firing directly on the Viet Minh attackers, blasting huge holes in their ranks. Another group of French, near the airfield, opened fire on the Viet Minh with anti-aircraft machine guns, forcing the Viet Minh to retreat.<ref name="d246"/> 

However, the Viet Minh were more successful in their simultaneous attacks elsewhere. The 316th division captured Eliane 1 from its Moroccan defenders, and half of Eliane 2 by midnight.<ref name="d247">Davidson, 247</ref> On the other side of Dien Bien Phu, the 308th attacked Huguette 7, and nearly succeeded in breaking through, but a French sergeant took charge of the defenders and sealed the breach.<ref name="d247"/> 

Just after midnight on the 31st, the French launched a fierce counterattack against Eliane 2, and recaptured half of it. Langlais ordered another counterattack the following afternoon against Dominique 2 and Eliane 1, using virtually "everybody left in the garrison who could be trusted to fight."<ref name="d247"/> The counterattacks allowed the French to retake Dominique 2 and Eliane 1, but the Viet Minh launched their own renewed assault. The French, who were exhausted and without reserves, fell back from both positions late in the afternoon.<ref>Davidson, 248</ref> Reinforcements were sent north from Isabelle, but were attacked en route and fell back to Isabelle.

Shortly after dark on the 31st, Langlais told Major [[Marcel Bigeard]], who was leading the defense at Eliane, to fall back across the river. Bigeard refused, saying "As long as I have one man alive I won't let go of Eliane 4. Otherwise, Dien Bien Phu is done for."<ref name="roy210">Roy, 210</ref> The night of the 31st, the 316th division attacked Eliane 2. Just as it appeared the French were about to be overrun, a few French tanks arrived, and helped push the Viet Minh back. Smaller attacks on Eliane 4 were also pushed back. The Viet Minh briefly captured Huguette 7, only to be pushed back by a French counterattack at dawn on the 1st.<ref name="d253">Davidson, 253</ref>

Fighting continued in this style over the next several nights. The Viet Minh repeatedly attacked Eliane 2, only to be beaten back again and again. Repeated attempts to reinforce the French garrison by parachute drops were made, but had to be done by single planes at irregular times to avoid excessive casualties from Viet Minh anti-aircraft fire.<ref name="d253"/> Some reinforcements did arrive, but not nearly enough to replace French casualties.

===Trench warfare===
On [[April 5]], after a long night of battle, French fighter-bombers and artillery inflicted particularly gruesome losses on one regiment which was caught on open ground. At that point, Giap decided to change tactics. Although Giap still had the same objective – to overrun French defenses east of the river, he decided to emphasize [[trench warfare|entrenchment and sapping]].<ref>Davidson, 254-255</ref>

[[April 10]] saw the French attempt to retake Eliane 1, which they had lost eleven days earlier. It had been a significant threat to Eliane 4 since, which the French wanted to eliminate. The dawn attack, which Bigeard devised, was preceded by a short, massive artillery barrage, followed by small unit infiltration attacks, followed by mopping-up operations. Without realizing it, Bigeard had re-invented the [[Infiltration tactics]] used with great success by [[Oskar von Hutier]] in   World War I. Eliane 1 changed hands several times that day, but by the next morning the French had control of it. The Viet Minh attempted to retake it on the evening of April 12, but were pushed back.<ref>Davidson, 265</ref>

"At this point, the morale of the Viet Minh soldiers broke. The French intercepted radio messages which told of units refusing orders, and Communist prisoners said that they were told to advance or be shot by the officers and noncommissioned officers behind them."<ref>Davidson, 256</ref> The extreme casualties they had suffered (6,000 killed, 8,000-10,000 wounded, and 2,500 captured) had taken a toll; worse, the Viet Minh had a total lack of medical facilities. "Nothing strikes at combat morale like the knowledge that if wounded, the soldier will go uncared for."<ref>Davidson, 257</ref> To avert the crisis, Giap called in fresh reinforcements from Laos. 

During the fighting at Eliane 1, on the other side of camp, the Viet Minh entrenchments had almost entirely surrounded Huguette 1 and 6. On [[April 11]], the garrison of Huguette 1 attacked, and were joined by artillery from the garrison of Claudine. The goal was to resupply Huguette 6 with water and ammunition. They repeated their attacks on the night of the 14&ndash;15th and 16&ndash;17th. While they did succeed in getting some supplies through, the heavy casualties convinced Langlais to abandon Huguette 6. Following a failed attempt to link up, on [[April 18]], the defenders at Huguette 6 made a daring break out, but only a few made it back to French lines.<ref>Davidson, 258</ref><ref>Fall, 260</ref> The Viet Minh repeated the isolation and probing attacks against Huguette 1, and overran it on the morning of [[April 22]]. With the fall of Huguette 1, the Viet Minh took control of more than 90% of the airfield, making accurate parachute drops impossible.<ref>Fall, 270</ref> This caused the landing zone to become perilously small, choking off much needed supplies.<ref>Davidson, 259</ref> A French attack against Huguette 1 later that day was repulsed.

===Isabelle===
Isabelle saw only desultory action until [[March 30]], when the Viet Minh succeeded in isolating it and beating back the attempt to send reinforcement north. Following a massive artillery barrage against Isabelle on [[March 30]], the Viet Minh began employing the same trench warfare against Isabelle as they were using against the central camp. By the end of April, Isabelle had exhausted its water supply and was nearly out of ammunition.<ref>Davidson, 260</ref>

===Final defeat===
The Viet Minh launched a massed assault against the exhausted defenders on the night of [[May 1]], overrunning Eliane 1, Dominique 3, and Huguette 5, although the French managed to beat back attacks on Eliane 2. On [[May 6]], the Viet Minh launched another massed attack against Eliane 2 again. The attack included, for the first time, [[Katyusha]] rockets.<ref name="d236"/> The French, too, used a new innovation. The French artillery fired with a "TOT" (time on target) attack, so that artillery fired from different positions would arrive on target at the same time.<ref>Davidson, 261</ref> The barrage wiped out the assault wave. A few hours later that night, the Viet Minh detonated a mine shaft, literally blowing Eliane 2 up. The Viet Minh attacked again, and within a few hours had overrun the defenders.<ref>Davidson, 262</ref>

On [[May 7]], Giap ordered an all out attack against the remaining French units. At 5:00 PM, de Castries radioed French headquarters in Hanoi and talked with Cogny. 

:De Castries: "The Viets are everywhere. The situation is very grave. The combat is confused and goes on all about. I feel the end is approaching, but we will fight to the finish."
:Cogny: "Well understood. You will fight to the end. It is out of the question to run up the white flag after your heroic resistance."<ref name="time"/>

By nightfall, all French central positions had been captured. That night, the garrison at Isabelle made a breakout attempt. While the main body did not even escape the valley, about 70 troops (out of the 1,700 men in the garrison) did escape to Laos.<ref>Davidson, 269</ref>

==Aftermath==
===Prisoners===
On [[May 8]], the Viet Minh counted 11,721 prisoners, of whom 4,436 were wounded.<ref name="losses">{{cite web

===Political ramifications===
The garrison constituted roughly a tenth of the total French manpower in Indochina;<ref>"The French expeditionary Force numbered 175,000 troops" - Davidson, 163</ref> thus, its loss effectively ended the War. Following the battle, the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|1954 Geneva accords]] partitioned Vietnam into [[communist]] [[North Vietnam]]ese and French [[South Vietnam]]ese administered zones. This partition was supposed to be temporary, and the two zones were supposed to be reunited by national elections in 1956. After the French withdrawal, the [[United States|U.S.]] supported a southern government under Emperor [[Bao Dai]] as chief of state and his Prime Minister [[Ngo Dinh Diem]], which opposed the Geneva agreement, arguing that [[Ho Chi Minh]] from the North had been killing Northern patriots and terrorizing people both in the North and the South. This dispute would eventually escalate into the [[Vietnam War]] (Second Indochina War).

The defeat in Indochina seriously damaged French prestige elsewhere in their colonial empire, notably the North African territories from where many of the troops who fought at Dien Bien Phu had been recruited. In 1954, six months after the battle at Dien Bien Phu ended, the [[Algerian War of Independence]] started, and by 1956, both Morocco and Tunisia had gained independence. 

The battle was depicted in ''[[Diên Biên Phu (film)|Diên Biên Phu]]'', a 1992 drama film by French director [[Pierre Schoendoerffer]].

===US participation===
The United States provided the French with material aid during the battle - planes, weapons, mechanics, and civilian teams.<ref>Roy, 140</ref> However, the United States intentionally avoided public direct intervention. In February 1954 - following French occupation of Dien Bien Phu but prior to the battle - Democratic senator [[Mike Mansfield]] asked [[United States Defense Secretary]] [[Charles Erwin Wilson]] whether the US would send naval or air units if the French were subjected to greater pressure there. "For the moment there is no justification for raising United States aid above its present level". US President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] also stated that "Nobody is more opposed to intervention than I am".<ref>Roy, 140</ref> On [[March 31]], following the fall of Beatrice, Gabrielle, Anne-Marie, a panel of US Senators and House Representatives questioned US [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], Admiral [[Arthur W. Radford]] about the possibility of US involvement. Radford concluded it was too late for the US Air Force to save the French garrison. A proposal for direct intervention was unanimously voted down by the panel, which "concluded that intervention was a positive [[act of war]]".<ref>Roy, 211</ref>

The United States did covertly participate in the battle, however. Following a request for help from Henri Navarre, Radford provided two squadrons of [[B-26 Marauder]] bomber aircraft to support the French.  Subsequently, thirty-seven US pilots flew 682 sorties over the course of the battle. Two of them – Wallace Buford and [[James "Earthquake McGoon" McGovern Jr.]] – were killed in action. Seven of those pilots were later awarded the French [[Legion of Honor]]. The role the US pilots played in the battle has remained little known – "US historian Erik Kirsinger researched the case for more than a year to establish the facts."<ref>"France honors US pilots for Dien Bien Phu role". ''Agence France Presse.'' February 25, 2005.</ref><ref>Burns, Robert. "Covert U.S. aviators will get French award for heroism in epic Asian battle". ''Associated Press Worldstream''. February 16, 2005</ref> French author Jules Roy also suggests that Radford discussed with the French the possibility of using [[atomic weapons]] in support of the garrison.<ref>Roy, 198</ref> Moreover, [[John Foster Dulles]] was reported to have mentioned the possibility of lending atomic bombs to the French for use at Dien Bien Phu,<ref>Fall, 306</ref> and a similar source claims that British Foreign Secretary [[Sir Anthony Eden]] was aware of the possibility of atomic defense in the region.<ref>Fall, 307</ref>

===Khe Sanh===
During the [[Vietnam War]] fourteen years later, the [[North Vietnamese Army]] (still under Giap's command) attempted to repeat their success at Dien Bien Phu in the [[Battle of Khe Sanh]]. However, a number of factors were significantly different, allowing the Americans to win. Khe Sanh was much closer to its supply base (45 kilometers versus 200 at Dien Bien Phu);<ref>Rottman, 8</ref> At Khe Sanh, the Americans held the high ground, and their artillery forced the Vietnamese to use their artillery from a much greater distance, while at Dien Bien Phu the French artillery (six 105 mm batteries and one battery of four 155 mm howitzers and mortars<ref>Fall, 480</ref>) were only sporadically effective;<ref>Rottman, 9</ref> Khe Sanh received 18,000 tons in aerial resupply during the 30 day battle, whereas during 167 days the French forces at Dien Bien Phu received only 4,000 tons.<ref>Rottman, 9</ref> And lastly, the US Air Force dropped 114,810 tons of bombs on the Vietnamese at Khe Sanh – roughly as much as on Japan in 1945 during [[World War II]].<ref>Rottman, 10</ref>
