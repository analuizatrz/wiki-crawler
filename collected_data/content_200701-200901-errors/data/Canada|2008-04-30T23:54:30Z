'''Canada''' ({{IPAEng|ˈkænədə}}) is a [[country]] occupying most of northern [[North America]], extending from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the east to the [[Pacific Ocean]] in the west and northward into the [[Arctic Ocean]].  It is the [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|world's second largest country]] by total area,<ref name="cia_factbook">{{cite web |author=Central Intelligence Agency |publisher= Central Intelligence Agency |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ca.html |title=The World Factbook: Canada |date=[[2006-05-16]] |accessdate=2007-05-06}}</ref> and shares [[Canada–United States border|land borders]] with the [[United States]] to the south and northwest. 

The land occupied by Canada was inhabited for millennia by various [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal peoples]].  Beginning in the late 15th century, [[British colonization of the Americas|British]] and [[French colonization of the Americas|French]] expeditions explored and later settled the Atlantic coast.  France ceded nearly all of [[New France|its colonies in North America]] in 1763 after the [[Seven Years War]].
In 1867, with the union of three [[British North America]]n colonies through [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], Canada was formed as a [[federalism|federal]] [[dominion]] of four provinces.<ref>{{cite web| title = Territorial evolution| work = Atlas of Canada | publisher = Natural Resources Canada |  url =http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/reference/anniversary_maps/terr_evol | format = html/pdf | accessdate =  2007-10-09| quote = In 1867, the colonies of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick are united in a federal state, the Dominion of Canada.... }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title = Canada: History| work = Country Profiles | publisher = Commonwealth Secretariat |  url =http://www.thecommonwealth.org/YearbookInternal/145152/history/ | format = html/pdf | accessdate =  2007-10-09| quote = The British North America Act of 1867 brought together four British colonies ... in one federal Dominion under the name of Canada.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last = Hillmer| first = Norman | authorlink =| coauthors = W.

A [[federation]] now comprising [[Provinces and territories of Canada|ten provinces and three territories]], Canada is a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] and a [[constitutional monarchy]], with [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] as its head of state. It is a [[Bilingualism in Canada|bilingual]] and [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] country, with both [[Canadian English|English]] and [[Canadian French|French]] as official languages at the federal level. [[Developed country|Technologically advanced and industrialized]], Canada maintains a diversified economy that is heavily reliant upon its abundant natural resources and upon trade—particularly with the United States, with which Canada has a [[Canada–United States relations|long and complex relationship]].

[[Image:Cartier.png|thumb|upright|left|[[Jacques Cartier]]]]

The name ''Canada'' most likely comes from a [[St. Lawrence Iroquoians|St. Lawrence Iroquoian]] word ''kanata'', meaning "village" or "settlement".  In 1535, inhabitants of the present-day [[Quebec City]] region used the word to direct explorer [[Jacques Cartier]] toward the village of [[Stadacona]].<ref>{{cite book | first = Bruce G. |last = Trigger | coauthors =  Pendergast, James F. | year = 1978 |chapter=Saint-Lawrence Iroquoians | title = Handbook of North American Indians Volume 15 | location= Washington |publisher= Smithsonian Institution | pages= pp. 357–361 | id = OCLC 58762737}}</ref> Cartier used the word 'Canada' to refer to not only that village, but the entire area subject to [[Donnacona]], Chief at Stadacona. By 1545, European books and maps began referring to this region as Canada.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/12356/12356-h/12356-h.htm | title = Relation originale de Jacques Cartier | publisher = Tross (1863 edition) | author = Jacques Cartier | date = 1545 | accessdate = 2007-02-23}}</ref> 

The French colony of [[Canada, New France|Canada]] referred to the part of [[New France]] along the [[Saint Lawrence River]] and the northern shores of the [[Great Lakes]]. Later, it was split into two British colonies, called [[Upper Canada]] and [[Lower Canada]] until their union as the British [[Province of Canada]] in 1841. Upon [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] in 1867, the name ''Canada'' was adopted for the entire country, and ''[[Dominion]]'' was conferred as the country's [[title]].<ref>J. E. Hodgetts.  2004.  "Dominion".  ''Oxford Companion to Canadian History'', Gerald Hallowell, ed.  (ISBN 0195415590)  Toronto: Oxford University Press; p. 183: "The title conferred on Canada by the preamble to the Constitution Act, 1867, whereby the provinces declare 'their desire to be federally united into one Dominion under the Crown of the United Kingdom'."</ref>  It was frequently referred to as the ''Dominion of Canada'' until the 1950s.  As Canada asserted its political autonomy from [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the federal government increasingly used ''Canada'' on legal state documents and treaties. The [[Canada Act 1982]] refers only to "Canada" and, as such, it is currently the only legal (and bilingual) name. This was reflected in 1982 with the renaming of the national holiday from [[Dominion Day]] to [[Canada Day]].

[[Image:Voyageur canoe.jpg|left|thumb|The [[fur trade]] was Canada's most important industry until the 1800s]]
Various groups of [[Inuit]] and [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|First Peoples]] inhabited [[North America]] prehistorically.  While no written documents exist, various forms of rock art, petroforms, [[petroglyphs]], and ancient artifacts provide thousands of years of information about the past.

French explorer [[Samuel de Champlain]] arrived in 1603 and established the first permanent European settlements at [[Port Royal, Nova Scotia|Port Royal]] in 1605 and [[Quebec City]] in 1608. These would become respectively the capitals of Acadia and Canada. Among [[French colonization of the Americas|French colonists]] of [[New France]], ''[[Canadiens]]'' extensively settled the [[St. Lawrence River]] valley, [[Acadians]] settled the present-day [[Maritimes]], while [[Coureurs de bois|French fur traders]] and [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle|Catholic missionaries]] explored the [[Great Lakes]], [[Hudson Bay]] and the [[Mississippi River#Watershed|Mississippi watershed]] to [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]]. The [[French and Iroquois Wars]] broke out over control of the [[fur trade]].

[[Image:Benjamin West 005.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'' on the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham|Plains of Abraham]] at [[Quebec City|Quebec]] in 1759, part of the [[French and Indian War|Seven Years' War]].]]

The [[Kingdom of England|English]] established fishing outposts in [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] around 1610 and [[British colonization of the Americas|colonized]] the [[Thirteen Colonies]] to the south. A series of four [[French and Indian Wars|Intercolonial Wars]] erupted between 1689 and 1763. Mainland [[Nova Scotia]] came under British rule with the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] (1713); the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]] ceded Canada and most of [[New France]] to [[British Empire|Britain]] following the [[French and Indian War|Seven Years' War]]. <!--(The western portion, [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]], was ceded to Spain, briefly.)-->

The [[Royal Proclamation of 1763|Royal Proclamation (1763)]] carved the [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Province of Quebec]] out of [[New France]] and annexed [[Cape Breton Island]] to [[Nova Scotia]]. It also restricted the language and religious rights of [[French Canadians]]. In 1769, St. John's Island (now [[Prince Edward Island]]) became a separate colony. To avert conflict in Quebec, the [[Quebec Act]] of 1774 expanded Quebec's territory to the [[Great Lakes]] and [[Ohio Valley]], and re-established the French language, Catholic faith, and French civil law in Quebec; it angered many residents of the Thirteen Colonies, helping to fuel the [[American Revolution]].<ref>{{cite web | author= |publisher= |title= Wars on Our Soil, earliest times to 1885 |accessdate=2006-08-21 |url=http://www.civilization.ca/cwm/gallery1/revolution2_e.html}}</ref> The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]] recognized American independence and ceded territories south of the [[Great Lakes]] to the [[United States]]. Approximately 50,000 [[United Empire Loyalists]] fled the [[United States]] to Canada.<ref name="moore">{{cite book |first= Christopher |last=Moore |year=1994 |title=The Loyalist: Revolution Exile Settlement |publisher=McClelland & Stewart |location= Toronto |id=ISBN 0-7710-6093-9}}</ref> [[New Brunswick]] was split from [[Nova Scotia]] as part of a reorganization of Loyalist settlements in the [[Maritimes]]. To accommodate English-speaking Loyalists in [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Quebec]], the [[Constitutional Act of 1791]] divided the province into French-speaking [[Lower Canada]] and English-speaking [[Upper Canada]], granting each their own elected Legislative Assembly. 

Canada was a major front in the [[War of 1812]] between the United States and British Empire. Its defence contributed to a sense of unity among British North Americans. Large-scale immigration to Canada began in 1815 from Britain and Ireland. The [[timber industry]] would also surpass the [[fur trade]] in importance in the early 1800s. 

[[Image:Fathers of Canadian Confederation.jpg|left|thumb|[[Fathers of Confederation]] by [[Robert Harris (painter)|Robert Harris]], an amalgamation of [[Charlottetown Conference|Charlottetown]] and [[Quebec Conference, 1864|Quebec conference]] scenes.]]

The desire for [[Responsible Government]] resulted in the aborted [[Rebellions of 1837]]. [[Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839)|The Durham Report (1839)]] would subsequently recommend responsible government and the assimilation of French Canadians into British culture.<ref name="ce_durhamreport">{{cite web |author=David Mills |publisher= Historica Foundation of Canada |url=http://www.canadianencyclopedia.ca/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0002473 |title=Durham Report |accessdate=2006-05-18}}</ref> The [[Act of Union (1840)]] merged [[The Canadas]]  into a [[United Province of Canada]]. French and English Canadians worked together in the Assembly to reinstate French rights. [[Responsible government#British North America|Responsible government]] was established for all British North American provinces by 1849. 

The signing of the [[Oregon Treaty]] by Britain and the United States in 1846 ended the [[Oregon boundary dispute]], extending the border westward along the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]], and paving the way for British colonies on [[Colony of Vancouver Island|Vancouver Island (1849)]] and in [[Colony of British Columbia|British Columbia (1858)]]. Canada launched a series of western exploratory expeditions to claim [[Rupert's Land]] and the [[Arctic]] region. The Canadian population grew rapidly because of high birth rates; British immigration was offset by emigration to the United States, especially by French Canadians moving to [[New England]].

[[Image:Canada provinces evolution.gif|thumb|right|An animated map, exhibiting [[Territorial evolution of Canada|the growth and change of Canada's provinces and territories since Confederation.]]]]

Following several constitutional conferences, the [[Constitution Act, 1867]] brought about [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] creating "one Dominion under the name of [[Canada's name#Adoption of Dominion|Canada]]" on July 1, 1867 with four provinces: [[Ontario]], [[Quebec]], [[Nova Scotia]], and [[New Brunswick]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Farthing |first= John |title= Freedom Wears a Crown |location= Toronto |publisher=Kingswood House |date=1957 |id = ASIN B0007JC4G2}}</ref>  Canada assumed control of [[Rupert's Land]] and the [[North-Western Territory]] to form the [[Northwest Territories]], where [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis']] grievances ignited the [[Red River Rebellion]] and the creation of the province of [[Manitoba]] in July 1870. British Columbia and Vancouver Island (which had [[United Colonies of Vancouver Island and British Columbia|united]] in 1866) and the colony of [[Prince Edward Island]] joined Confederation in 1871 and 1873, respectively. 

[[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[John A. Macdonald]]'s [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative Party]] established a [[National Policy]] of [[tariffs]] to protect nascent Canadian manufacturing industries. To open the West, the government sponsored construction of three trans-continental railways  (most notably the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]), opened the prairies to settlement with the [[Dominion Lands Act]], and established the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|North-West Mounted Police]] to assert its authority over this territory.   In 1898, after the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] in the Northwest Territories, the Canadian government created the [[Yukon]] territory. Under [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Wilfrid Laurier]], continental European immigrants settled the prairies, and [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]] became provinces in 1905.

[[Image:Canadian tank and soldiers Vimy 1917.jpg|thumb|left|Canadian soldiers won the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]] in 1917.]]

Canada automatically entered the [[First World War]] in 1914 with Britain's declaration of war, sending volunteers to the Western Front, who played a substantial role in the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]]. The [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]]  erupted when [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|conservative]] Prime Minister [[Robert Borden]] brought in compulsory military service over the objection of French-speaking Quebecers.  In 1919, Canada joined the [[League of Nations]] independently of Britain; in 1931 the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] affirmed Canada's independence. 

The [[Great Depression of 1929]] brought economic hardship to all of Canada. In response, the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (CCF) in Alberta and Saskatchewan presaged a welfare state as pioneered by [[Tommy Douglas]] in the 1940s and 1950s. Canada [[Military history of Canada during World War II|declared war on Germany]] independently during [[World War II]] under Liberal Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]], three days after Britain.

Under successive [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] governments of [[Lester B. Pearson]] and [[Pierre Trudeau]], a new [[Canadian identity]] emerged. Canada adopted its current [[Flag of Canada|Maple Leaf Flag]] in 1965. In response to a more assertive [[francophone|French-speaking]] [[Quebec]], the federal government became [[Bilingualism in Canada|officially bilingual]] with the [[Official Languages Act (Canada)|Official Languages Act]] of 1969.  Non-discriminatory [[Immigration to Canada|Immigration Acts]] were introduced in 1967 and 1976, and official [[Multiculturalism#Origins in Canada|multiculturalism]] in 1971; waves of non-European immigration had changed the face of the country. [[Social democratic]] programs such as [[Medicare (Canada)|Universal Health Care]], the [[Canada Pension Plan]], and [[Canada Student Loans]] were initiated in the 1960s and consolidated in the 1970s; provincial governments, particularly Quebec, fought these as incursions into their jurisdictions. Finally, Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] pushed through the [[patriation]] of the constitution from Britain, enshrining a [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] based on [[individual rights]] in the [[Constitution Act of 1982]]. Canadians continue to take pride in their [[Health care in Canada|system of universal health care]], their commitment to multiculturalism, and human rights.<ref name="bickerton">{{cite book |author=Bickerton, James & Gagnon, Alain-G & Gagnon, Alain (Eds). |title=Canadian Politics |publisher=Broadview Press |edition=4th edition |location=Orchard Park, NY |id=ISBN 1-55111-595-6 |year=2004}}</ref>

[[Quebec]] underwent profound social and economic changes during the [[Quiet Revolution]] of the 1960s. [[Québécois]] [[Quebec nationalism|nationalists]] began pressing for greater provincial autonomy and others for Quebec independence. Radical Quebec nationalist militants of the [[Front de libération du Québec]] (FLQ) which committed acts of terrorism against anglophone Québécois  brought Canada into crisis in 1970, when they kidnapped British Trade Commissioner [[John Cross]] and murdered Quebec Labour Minister [[Pierre Laporte]], in which Canada invoked the controversial [[War Measures Act]] which allowed Canadian law enforcement to arrest any suspected militants without warrants. After 1970, no significant militant Quebec nationalism continued, and moderate Quebec nationalism prevailed under the [[Parti Québécois]] of [[René Lévesque]] which came to power in Quebec in 1976. A [[referendum]] on [[sovereignty-association]] in [[1980 Quebec referendum|1980]] was rejected by a solid majority of the population. Efforts by [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] (PC) government of [[Brian Mulroney]] to recognize Quebec as a "distinct society" under the [[Meech Lake Accord]] in 1987 collapsed in 1989. Anger in French Quebec and a sense of alienation in Canada's western provinces resulted in a sovereignist federal party [[Bloc Québécois]] under [[Lucien Bouchard]] and the [[Reform Party of Canada]] under [[Preston Manning]] rising to prominence in the [[Canadian federal election, 1993|election of 1993]]. Each advocated for greater decentralization in [[Canadian federalism]] in opposition to the more centralized vision of Liberal Prime Minister [[Jean Chrétien]]. Another Parti Québécois government in Quebec led by [[Jacques Parizeau]] held a second referendum [[1995 Quebec referendum|in 1995]] that was rejected by a slimmer margin of just 50.6% to 49.4%.<ref name="dickinson">{{cite book |first= John Alexander |last=Dickinson |coauthors=Young, Brian |year=2003 |title=A Short History of Quebec |publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |edition=3rd edition |location= Montreal |id=ISBN 0-7735-2450-9}}</ref> In 1997, the Canadian Supreme Court ruled [[Reference re Secession of Quebec|unilateral secession]] by a province to be unconstitutional, and Parliament passed the "[[Clarity Act]]" outlining the terms of a negotiated departure.<ref name="dickinson" /> A merger of Reform and PC Parties into the [[Conservative Party of Canada]] was completed in 2003.

[[Image:parliament2.jpg|thumb|right|The Chamber of the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]].]]
The [[Parliament of Canada|federal parliament]] is made up of the Queen and two houses: an elected House of Commons and an appointed [[Canadian Senate|Senate]]. Each member in the House of Commons is elected by [[plurality electoral system|simple plurality]] in a [[electoral district (Canada)|''riding'' or electoral district]]; general elections are called by the Governor General when the Prime Minister so advises or when the government loses the [[Vote of confidence|confidence]] of the House. While there is no minimum term for a Parliament, a new election must be called within five years of the last general election. Members of the Senate, whose seats are apportioned on a regional basis, are chosen by the Prime Minister and formally appointed by the Governor General, and serve until age 75.

Four parties have had substantial representation in the federal parliament since 2006 elections: the [[Conservative Party of Canada]] (governing party), the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] (Official Opposition), the [[New Democratic Party]] (NDP), and the ''[[Bloc Québécois]]''. The [[Green Party of Canada]] does not have current representation in Parliament, but garners a significant share of the national vote. The list of [[List of political parties in Canada#Historical parties that have won seats in Parliament|historical parties]] with elected representation is substantial.

== Law ==
{{main|Law of Canada}}
[[Image:Supreme Court of Canada.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in Ottawa, west of Parliament Hill.]]

Canada's [[judiciary]] plays an important role in interpreting laws and has the power to strike down laws that violate the Constitution. The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] is the highest court and final arbiter and is led by the Right Honourable Madam Chief Justice [[Beverley McLachlin]], P.C. since 2000. Its nine members are appointed by the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] on the advice of the Prime Minister and Minister of Justice. All judges at the superior and appellate levels are appointed after consultation with non-governmental legal bodies. The federal cabinet also appoints justices to superior courts at the provincial and territorial levels. Judicial posts at the lower provincial and territorial levels are filled by their respective governments (see [[Court system of Canada]] for more detail).

[[Common law]] prevails everywhere except in [[Quebec]], where [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] predominates. [[Criminal law in Canada|Criminal law]] is solely a federal responsibility and is uniform throughout Canada. Law enforcement, including criminal courts, is a provincial responsibility, but in rural areas of all provinces except Ontario and Quebec, policing is contracted to the federal [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP).

== Foreign relations and military ==

[[Image:Peacekeeping monument.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Peacekeeping Monument]] in Ottawa.]]

Canada and the [[U.S.-Canada relations|United States]] share the world's longest undefended [[border]], co-operate on military campaigns and exercises, and are each other's largest trading partners. Canada has nevertheless maintained an independent foreign policy, most notably maintaining full relations with [[Cuba]] and declining to participate in the [[Iraq War]]. Canada also maintains historic ties to the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]] and to other former British and French colonies through Canada's membership in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and [[La Francophonie]] (French-Speaking Countries). 

Canada currently employs a professional, volunteer military force of about 64,000 regular and 26,000 reserve personnel.<ref>{{cite web |author=Assistant Deputy Minister (Public Affairs) |authorlink=Department of National Defence (Canada) |publisher= Department of National Defence |url=http://www.forces.gc.ca/site/about/family_e.asp |title=The National Defence family|accessdate=2006-05-14}}</ref> The unified [[Canadian Forces]] (CF) comprise the [[Canadian Forces Land Force Command|army]], [[Canadian Forces Maritime Command|navy]], and [[Canadian Forces Air Command|air force]].

== Provinces and territories ==
{{main|Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian federalism}}
[[Image:Map Canada political-geo.png|thumb|left|A geopolitical map of Canada, exhibiting its [[Provinces and territories of Canada|ten provinces and three territories]].]]

Canada is a [[federation]] composed of ten [[province]]s and three [[Territory (country subdivision)|territories]]; in turn, these may be [[List of regions of Canada|grouped into regions]]. [[Western Canada]] consists of [[British Columbia]] and the three [[Canadian Prairies|Prairie provinces]] ([[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]], and [[Manitoba]]). [[Central Canada]] consists of [[Quebec]] and [[Ontario]]. [[Atlantic Canada]] consists of the three [[Maritimes|Maritime provinces]] ([[New Brunswick]], [[Prince Edward Island]], and [[Nova Scotia]]), along with [[Newfoundland and Labrador]].  [[Eastern Canada]] refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together.  Three territories ([[Yukon]], [[Northwest Territories]], and [[Nunavut]]) make up [[Northern Canada]]. Provinces have a [[Canadian federalism|more autonomy]] from the federal government than territories. Each has its own [[List of Canadian provincial and territorial symbols|provincial or territorial symbols]].

The provinces are responsible for most of Canada's social programs (such as [[Health care in Canada|health care]], [[Education in Canada|education]], and [[welfare (financial aid)|welfare]]) and together collect more revenue than the federal government, an almost unique structure among federations in the world. Using its spending powers, the federal government can initiate national policies in provincial areas, such as the [[Canada Health Act]]; the provinces can opt out of these, but rarely do so in practice. [[Equalization payments]] are made by the federal government to ensure that reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.

All provinces have [[unicameral]], elected [[Legislative Assemblies of Canada's provinces and territories|legislatures]] headed by a [[premier (Canada)|Premier]] selected in the same way as the Prime Minister of Canada. Each province also has a [[Lieutenant-Governor (Canada)|Lieutenant-Governor]] representing the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen]], analogous to the Governor General of Canada.  The Lieutenant-Governor is appointed on the recommendation of the Prime Minister of Canada, though with increasing levels of consultation with provincial governments in recent years.

In eastern Canada, the Saint Lawrence River widens into the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]], the world's largest [[estuary]], which contains the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].

[[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]] are divided by the [[Bay of Fundy]], which experiences the world's largest tidal variations. [[Ontario]] and [[Hudson Bay]] dominate central Canada. West of Ontario, the broad, flat [[Canadian Prairies]] spread toward the [[Rocky Mountains]], which separate them from [[British Columbia]].

In western Canada, the [[Mackenzie River]] flows from the [[Great Slave Lake]] to the [[Arctic Ocean]].  A tributary of a tributary of the Mackenzie is the [[South Nahanni River]], which is home to [[Virginia Falls, Northwest Territories|Virginia Falls]], a waterfall about twice as high as [[Niagara Falls]].

The northern Canadian mainland is ringed with a vast [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago|archipelago]] containing some of the [[List of islands by area|world's largest islands]].

Average winter and summer high temperatures across Canada vary depending on the location.

Economic integration with the United States has increased significantly since World War II. The ''Canada-United States Automotive Agreement'' (or [[Canada-United States Automotive Agreement|Auto Pact]]) in 1965 opened the borders to trade in the auto manufacturing industry. The ''Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement'' ([[Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement|FTA]]) of 1988 eliminated tariffs between the two countries, while ''North American Free Trade Agreement'' ([[NAFTA]]) expanded the free trade zone to include [[Mexico]] and [[Chile]] in the 1990s .
