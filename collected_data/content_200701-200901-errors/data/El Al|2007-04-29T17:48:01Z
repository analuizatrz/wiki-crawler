El Al's first flight was in September 1948 when the first [[President of Israel]], [[Haim Weizman]] was flown to [[Tel Aviv]] from [[Geneva]]. The airline established itself as a scheduled carrier [[15 November]] of that year, starting ordinary operations in [[August]] [[1949]] with a service from [[Tel Aviv]] to [[Paris]] and [[Rome]]. This was extended a year later to [[London]]. In the early [[1950s]], the airline carried over 160,000 immigrants to Israel from [[India]], [[Iran]], and [[Yemen]] as part of [[Operation Magic Carpet (Yemen)|Operation Magic Carpet]] and [[Operation Ezra and Nehemiah]]. On [[27 July]] [[1955]] an El Al [[Lockheed Constellation]] was shot down over [[Bulgaria]]. All of the crew and passengers were killed.

On [[15 June]] [[1961]], the airline set the world record for the longest non-stop commercial flight with the introduction of non-stop Tel Aviv to [[New York]] services. Its its [[Boeing 707]], covered 5,760 miles in 9 hours and 33 minutes. On [[23 July]] [[1968]], the first and only successful hijacking of an El Al aircraft took place when a 707 carrying 10 crew and 38 passengers was taken over by three members of the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (PFLP). The aircraft was [[enroute]] from [[Rome]], [[Italy]], to [[Lod]], [[Israel]]. The hijackers diverted it to [[Algiers]]. The negotiations extended over 40 days and both the hijackers and the 21 Israeli hostages ultimately went free. It later emerged that the hijackers left Beirut armed, with the full consent of the Lebanese authorities.{{fact|date=april 2007}} Accordingly, Israel held Lebanon accountable, and retaliated on [[28 December]] [[1968]] when it raided [[Lebanon|Lebanon's]] airport and destroyed 13 planes on the ground, most of which belonged to [[Middle East Airlines]].

===1970s and 1980s===

El Al continued to grow as more refugees migrated to Israel. In 1970, passengers and crew foiled a hijacking attempt on an El Al aircraft as part of the [[Dawson's Field hijackings]]. Another attempt was thwarted as part of the [[Hindawi Affair]] on [[18 April]] [[1986]]. In this case, a pregnant Irishwoman named [[Anne Mary Murphy]] was about to board an El Al flight at [[London]]'s [[Heathrow Airport]] when her bag was found to contain 3 pounds of plastic explosives. The explosives had been planted by her fiancé [[Nezar Hindawi]] who was to go on a separate flight. Hindawi was jailed for 45 years, the longest sentence ever delivered by a British court. Murphy, who had been duped, later gave birth to their daughter. There was evidence that [[Syrian]] officials were involved and as a result, Britain cut off diplomatic relations with Syria. 

April 1980 saw the launch of non-stop El Al service from Tel Aviv to [[Cairo]] following the peace agreement between the two nations. In March 1984 the airline entered the record books once again with the first international [[Boeing 767]] flight when they flew from [[Montreal]] to Tel Aviv. In May 1988, El Al operated what is to this day its longest non-stop flight in history from [[Los Angeles]] Tel Aviv, a journey of 7,000 statute miles in 13 hours, 41 minutes.

===1990s and early 2000s===

As the airline continued to grow, El Al continued to carry out humanitarian missions rescuing Jews from around the world. On [[24 May]] [[1991]] an El Al [[Boeing 747]] airlifted a record-breaking 1,087 passengers, [[Ethiopian Jews]] flying from [[Addis Ababa]] to Israel as part of [[Operation Solomon]]. 

On [[4 October]], [[1992]], [[El Al Flight 1862]], a [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-200F]] cargo plane, crashed into the Groeneveen and Klein-Kluitberg flats in [[Bijlmermeer]], a neighbourhood of [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]]. The three crew members, one passenger, and 43 on the ground were killed. It was in 1997 that [[El Al Cargo|El Al's cargo branch]] became an independent entity. In [[February]] [[1995]] El Al left the technical receivership it had been operating under since [[1982]] and in June 1996, another milestone was hit with the inaugaral flight from Israel to [[Amman]], [[Jordan]]. El Al's first [[Boeing 777]] took off for the first time in March 2000, and the first phase of a long delayed [[privatisation]] was initiated in [[June]] [[2003]] when 15% of the airline's shares were listed on the [[Tel Aviv Stock Exchange]]. [[Arkia Israel Airlines]] parent company, [[Knafaim-Arkia Holdings]], acquired a large stake in mid-2004 and intended to take complete ownership. Today, the owners are Knafaim-Arkia Holdings (40%), private investors (30%) and the [[Israel|state]] (30%). 

On [[4 July]], [[2002]], [[Hesham Mohamed Hadayet]] shot six Israelis at El Al's ticket counter at [[Los Angeles International Airport]] ([[LAX]]). Two of the victims died. Although the gunman was not linked to any terrorist group, Hadayet, an [[Egypt]]ian, espoused anti-Israeli views and was opposed to U.S. policy in the Middle East.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/West/04/12/airport.shooting/ | title=FBI, Justice: El Al attack was terrorism | accessdate=2007-04-29 | publisher=CNN}}</ref> This led the [[FBI]] to classify the shooting as a [[terrorist act]], one of the few on U.S. soil since the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]. On [[23 October]], [[2003]] an El Al Boeing 767 flying from Tel Aviv to Los Angeles via Toronto was diverted to [[Mirabel International Airport]] and then on to [[Hamilton/John C. Munro International Airport|Hamilton Airport]], where [[RCMP]] tactical teams were ready. The diversion was the result of a "severe security threat," which was later clarified as a possible [[surface-to-air missile]] attack on the aircraft upon landing in Toronto.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cbc.ca/story/news/national/2003/10/26/pearson_elal031026.html | title=Israeli Flight Lands in Toronto| accessdate=2006-11-12 | publisher=CBC News}}</ref>

===Recent History===


On [[7 June]], [[2006]], the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Attorney General]] reported that seven [[North Africa]]ns were arrested in connection with a [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to blow up an unspecified El Al flight the following day. At the time of the arrest, El Al's flights between [[Tel Aviv]] and [[London]] flew over the area where a ground-to-air missile was discovered and later that year, following a strike that temporarily shut down the airline at the end of November, El Al decided to fly some of their planes on [[Shabbat]] in order to get back on schedule. This led to a large-scale [[Haredi]] boycott of the airline. On [[5 January]] [[2007]], a deal was signed between El Al and the Haredi community, which stated that El Al will not fly on Shabbat.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/810030.html | title=El Al, ultra-Orthodox sign deal to end dispute over Shabbat flights | accessdate=2007-01-05 | publisher=Haaretz}}</ref>

In [[January]] [[2007]], El Al signed cooperation agreements with [[Austrian Airlines]], [[Lufthansa]], and [[Swiss International Airlines]], and announced that they would schedule their flights to enable shorter waiting times for passengers on connecting flights. El Al also opened a new [[King David Lounge]] at [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]]. New lounges at [[Heathrow Airport]] and [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] will open later this year. Today, the company employs 5,417 staff globally and boasts a fleet of over 30 aircraft.

==Security==

El Al has the reputation of being the most secure airline in the world <ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/sept11/2001/10/01/elal-usat.htm | title= 
Unfriendly skies are no match for El Al | accessdate=2007-04-29 | publisher=USA Today}}</ref> for the following reasons:

===On the plane===

Approximately six undercover agents (formerly two; exact numbers are never given for security purposes) accompany each international El Al flight, sitting amongst passengers, with hidden firearms. Most El Al pilots are former [[Israeli Air Force]] fighter pilots, and all El Al flight crew members are trained in hand-to-hand combat. In fact, most El Al employees have served in the [[Israel Defense Force]] (since national service is compulsory in Israel for most citizens).

The cockpit in El Al's [[aircraft]] have double doors to prevent entry by unauthourized people. A [[password|code]] is required to access the doors, and the second door will only be opened after the first has closed and the person has been identified by the [[captain]] or [[first officer]].

There are reinforced [[steel]] floors separating the [[passenger]] [[cabin]] from the [[baggage]] hold.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=2&ObjectID=10396216 | title=Flying under the eagle eyes of El Al's famed high security | accessdate=2006-08-15 | publisher=New Zealand Herald}}</ref> This is intended to strengthen the plane in case of an explosion in the hold or vice versa.

The El Al fleet is also the only commercial airline fleet in the world to be equipped with anti-missile [[countermeasures]] (the radar-based ''[[Flight Guard]]'' system). [[Switzerland]] has refused El Al flights landing rights because of fears that [[flares]] dropped by such an automated system might cause fires on the ground near airports, and other European governments have expressed similar views.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3221013,00.html | title=Europe objects to El Al's anti-missile shield | accessdate=2006-11-12 | publisher=YNet News}}</ref> El Al does not comment about the specifications of these systems.

===On the ground===

Passengers are asked to report three hours before takeoff. All El Al terminals around the world are closely monitored by security agents in either plain clothes or fully armed local police or army personnel, who patrol the premises for explosives, suspicious behavior, and other threats. Inside, passengers and their baggage are checked by a trained team. El Al security procedures also require that all passengers be interviewed individually prior to boarding, allowing El Al staff to identify possible security threats with probing questions, such as their origin, goal and occupation. The likelihood of potential terrorists maintaining their calmness under such inquisitive probing is considered low.

At the [[check-in]] counter, ground staff scrutinize the [[passport]] and the [[ticket]]. They will not accept a ticket without a sticker from the [[security]] checkers. Once through passport control, where the person's name is checked through a computer, which utilizes information from both the [[FBI]] and [[Scotland Yard]] terrorism databases, the person and their hand luggage go through rigorous screening, including hand searches. In addition, all luggage must pass through a decompression chamber; this simulates pressures during flight which may be triggers for explosives.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.segl.com/xj.php | title=El Al Decompression Chamber | accessdate=2006-07-18 | publisher=Simcoe Engineering Group Limited}}</ref> El Al is the only airline in the world that passes all luggage through such a chamber. Even in airports in the United States, El Al security agents conduct all luggage searches personally, though they are often supervised by government or private security firms who otherwise have screening responsibilities.
