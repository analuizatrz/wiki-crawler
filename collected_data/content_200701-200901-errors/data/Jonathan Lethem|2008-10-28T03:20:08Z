==Biography==
===Early life===
Lethem was born in [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]], [[New York]] to [http://www.richardlethem.com Richard Brown Lethem], an [[avant-garde]] painter, and Judith Lethem, a political [[activist]].  He was the eldest of three children; his brother, Blake, is an artist, and his sister, Mara, is a photographer and writer.<ref name= "dodger">McGlone, Jackie.  [http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/critique.cfm?id=816862007 "Brooklyn dodger"], [[The Scotsman]], 2007-05-26.  Retrieved on [[2007]]-[[08-29]].</ref>  Jonathan was raised in a [[Commune (intentional community)|commune]] in the pre-[[gentrification|gentrified]] Brooklyn neighborhood of [[Boerum Hill]].  Despite a pervasive feeling of racial tension, he later described his [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] childhood as “thrilling” and culturally wide-reaching;<ref name= "dodger"/> he gained an encyclopedic knowledge of the music of [[Bob Dylan]], saw ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' twenty-one times during its original theatrical release,<ref name= "guard">Edemariam, Aida. [http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,2093135,00.html "The borrower"], [[The Guardian]], 2007-06-02.  Retrieved on [[2007]]-[[08-01]].</ref> and read the complete works of the [[science fiction]] writer [[Philip K. Dick]].  Lethem later called Dick’s work “as formative an influence as marijuana or punk rock—as equally responsible for beautifully fucking up my life, for bending it irreversibly along a course I still travel.”<ref>Lethem (2005). p. 77.</ref>

His parents divorced when Lethem was young.  When he was thirteen, his mother Judith died from a malignant [[brain tumor]],<ref>Lethem (2005). p. 36-37.</ref> an experience he has said haunted him and heavily affected his writing.  In 2007, Lethem explained that "My books all have this giant, howling missing [center]—language has disappeared, or someone has vanished, or memory has gone."<ref name= "dodger"/>  Intending to become a visual artist like his father, Lethem attended [[the High School of Music & Art]], where he painted in a style he describes as "glib, show-offy, usually cartoonish."<ref name= "post">[http://www.postroadmag.com/Issue_5/Etcetera5/Lethem.htm “Interview: Jonathan Lethem"], Post Road Magazine, Fall/Winter 2002.  Retrieved on [[2007]]-[[08-29]].</ref>  At Music & Art he produced his own zine, ''The Literary Exchange,'' that featured artwork and writing, created animated films, and wrote a 125-page unpublished novel, ''Heroes''.

After graduating from high school, Lethem entered [[Bennington College]] in [[Vermont]] in 1982 as a prospective art student.  At Bennington, Lethem experienced an “overwhelming....collision with the realities of class—my parents’ bohemian milieu had kept me from understanding, even a little, that we were poor....at Bennington that was all demolished by an encounter with the fact of real privilege.”<ref name= "post"/>  This, coupled with a growing realization that he was more interested in writing than art, led Lethem to drop out halfway through his sophomore year.  He [[hitchhiking|hitchhiked]] from [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], [[Colorado]] to [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[California]] in 1984, what he called "one of the stupidest and most memorable things I've ever done."<ref name= "scifistud">Kelleghan, Fiona.

Retrieved on [[2007]]-[[09-17]].</ref>  He lived in California for twelve years, working as a clerk in used bookstores and writing in his own time. Lethem published his first short story in 1989 and published several more in the early 1990s.<ref name= "sf">Houle, Zachary.

===First novels===
Lethem’s first novel, ''[[Gun, with Occasional Music]]'', is a merging of science fiction and the [[Raymond Chandler|Chandleresque]] detective story which includes talking [[kangaroo]]s, radical futuristic versions of the drug scene, and [[cryogenic]] prisons.  The novel was published in 1994 by [[Harcourt Brace]], in what Lethem later described as a "delirious" experience.  "I'd pictured my first novels being published as paperback originals,” he recalled, "and instead a prestigious house was doing the book in cloth....I was in heaven."<ref name= "post"/>  The novel was released to little initial fanfare, but an enthusiastic review in ''[[Newsweek]]'', which declared ''Gun'' an "audaciously assured first novel," catapulted the book to wider commercial success.<ref name= "barry">Gaffney, Elizabeth.  [http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA165462.html "Jonathan Lethem: Breaking the Barriers Between Genres"], [[Publishers Weekly]], 1998-03-30.  Retrieved on [[2007]]-[[09-19]].</ref>  ''Gun, with Occasional Music'' was a finalist for the 1994 [[Nebula Award]], and placed first in the "Best First Novel" category of the 1995 ''[[Locus (magazine)|Locus Magazine]]'' reader's poll.  In the mid-1990s, film producer-director [[Alan J. Pakula]] optioned the novel's movie rights, which allowed Lethem to quit working in bookstores and devote his time to writing.<ref name= "barry"/>

He followed ''Gun, with Occasional Music'' in 1995 with his second novel.  Partially inspired by Lethem's experiences hitchhiking cross-country,<ref name= "scifistud"/> ''[[Amnesia Moon]]'' uses a [[road trip|road]] narrative to explore a multi-[[post-apocalyptic]] future landscape rife with perception tricks.  After publishing many of his early stories in a 1996 collection (''[[The Wall of the Sky, the Wall of the Eye]]''), Lethem's third novel, ''[[As She Climbed Across the Table]]'', was published in 1997.  The novel takes as its starting point a physics researcher who falls in love with an artificially generated spatial anomaly called "Lack", for whom she spurns her previous partner.  Her ex-partner's comic struggle with this rejection, and with the anomaly constitute the majority of the narrative.

In 1996, Lethem moved from the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] back to Brooklyn.<ref name= "scifistud"/> His next book, published after his return to Brooklyn, was ''[[Girl in Landscape]]''.  In the novel, a young girl must endure [[puberty]] while also having to face a strange and new world populated by aliens known as Archbuilders.  ''Girl in Landscape'''s plot and characters, including the figures of a young girl and a violently protective father figure, were "very strongly influenced" by the 1956 [[John Wayne]] [[Western (genre)|Western]] ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]'', a movie with which Lethem is "obsessed."<ref>Lethem, Jonathan.

===Mainstream success and "genre bending"===
The first novel Lethem began after returning to New York City was ''[[Motherless Brooklyn]]'', a return to the detective theme, this time maintaining objective realism while exploring subjective [[alterity]] through Lionel Essrog, a protagonist with [[Tourette syndrome]] who is obsessed with language.  Lethem later called Essrog "obviously the character I’ve written with whom I most identify," and explained that the novel "stands outside myself....It’s the only one which doesn’t need me, never did.  It would have found someone to write it, by necessity."<ref name= "post"/>  Upon its publication in 1999, ''Motherless Brooklyn'' won the [[National Book Critics Circle Award#Fiction|National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction]], The [[Gold Dagger|Macallan Gold Dagger]] for crime fiction, and the ''[[Salon.com|Salon]]'' Book Award, and was named book of the year by ''[[Esquire]]''. In 1999, [[Edward Norton]] announced that he was planning to write, direct and star in a film adaptation of the novel;<ref>Fleming, Michael.  [http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117756590.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 "Norton birthing 'Motherless': New Line nurturing Lethem novel"], [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]], 1999-10-13.  Retrieved on [[2007]]-[[08-29]].</ref> in March 2007, Norton said he was still working on the screenplay.<ref>Clarke, Donald.

The mainstream success of ''Motherless Brooklyn'' made Lethem, according to ''[[The New York Times]]'', "something of a hipster celebrity," and he was referred to several times as a "[[Genre fiction|genre]] bender."<ref name= "nyti">Cardwell, Diane.  [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D02E6DD163AF935A2575AC0A9659C8B63 "Untangling the Knots of a Brooklyn Boyhood"] , [[The New York Times]], 2003-09-16.  Retrieved on [[2008-03-28]].</ref>  Critics cited Lethem's various novels, which were alternately hardboiled detective fiction, science fiction, and autobiographical.  (Lethem credited his comfort in genre-mixing to his father's art, which "always combined observed and imagined reality on the same canvas, very naturally, very un-self-consciously.")<ref name= "nyti"/>  In ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, [[Lev Grossman]] classed Lethem with a movement of authors similarly eager to blend literary and popular writing, including [[Michael Chabon]] (with whom Lethem is friends),<ref name= "eleanor">Henderson, Eleanor. [http://www.vqronline.org/articles/2007/summer/henderson-chabon-yiddish-policemen/ "From Pittsburgh to Sitka: On Michael Chabon’s ''The Yiddish Policemen’s Union''"] (book review), [[The Virginia Quarterly Review]], Summer 2007.

In 2003, Lethem definitively described his opinion of his supposed "genre bending":

<blockquote>The fact is, I used to get very involved, six or seven years ago, and before that, in questions of taxonomy of genre, and in the idea—which is ultimately a political idea—that a given writer, perhaps me, could in some objective way alter or reorganize the boundaries between genres....Nowadays, I've come to feel that talking about categories, about 'high' and 'low', about genre and their boundaries and the blurring of those boundaries, all consists only of an elaborate way to avoid actually discussing what moves and interests me about books—my own, and others'. What I like are books in their homely actuality—the insides of the books, the mysterious movements of characters and situations and the emotions that accompany those movements. The play of sentences, their infinite variety.<ref name= "fail">[http://www.failbetter.com/11/LethemInterview.htm "Jonathan Lethem Interview"], FailBetter.com, Summer/Fall 2003.  Retrieved on [[2007]]-[[08-29]].</ref></blockquote>

In the early 2000s, Lethem published a story collection, edited two anthologies, wrote magazine pieces, and published the 55-page novella ''[[This Shape We're In]]'' in 2000.  ''This Shape We're In'' was one of the first offerings from [[McSweeney's]] Books, the publishing [[imprint]] that arose from [[Dave Eggers]]'s [[Timothy McSweeney's Quarterly Concern|''McSweeney's Quarterly Concern'']].

In November 2000, Lethem said that he was working on an uncharacteristically "big sprawling" novel, about a child who grows up to be a rock journalist.<ref name= "sf"/>  The novel was published in 2003, as ''[[The Fortress of Solitude (novel)|The Fortress of Solitude]]''.  The semi-autobiographical [[bildungsroman]] features dozens of characters in a variety of milieus, but centers on a tale of racial tensions and boyhood in [[Brooklyn]] during the late 1970s.  The main characters are two friends of different backgrounds who grew up on the same block in [[Boerum Hill]]. It was named one of nine "Editor's Choice" books of the year by ''[[The New York Times]] '' and has been published in fifteen languages. 

His second collection of short fiction, ''[[Men and Cartoons]]'', was published in late 2004. In March 2005, ''[[The Disappointment Artist]]'', his first collection of essays, was released.  On September 20, 2005, Lethem was named one of the 2005 recipients of the [[Macarthur Grant#MacArthur Fellowship|MacArthur Fellowship]], often referred to as the "genius grant."

===Recent work===
In September 2006, Lethem published [http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/11216877/the_modern_times_of_bob_dylan_a_legend_comes_to_grips_with_his_iconic_status/print "The Genius of Bob Dylan"], a lengthy interview with Bob Dylan in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine; the interview contained Lethem's reflections on Dylan's artistic achievements, as well as revealing Dylan's dissatisfaction with contemporary recording techniques and his thoughts on his own status.

After ''Motherless Brooklyn'' and ''The Fortress of Solitude'', Lethem decided that "[i]t was time to leave Brooklyn in a literary sense anyway….I really needed to defy all that stuff about place and memory."<ref name= "dodger"/>  In 2007, he returned to the setting of [[California]], where some of his earlier fiction took place, with ''[[You Don't Love Me Yet]]'', a novel about an upstart rock band. The novel revolves around a woman in the band, Lucinda, who answers phones for her friend's complaint line and uses some of a caller's words as lyrics.  According to Lethem, ''You Don't Love Me Yet'' was inspired by the years he spent as the lead singer in an upstart California band  in the late 1980s and early 1990s, during what he called "the unformed posturing phase of life."<ref name= "hit song">Gilbert, Megan.

Dick, [[Charles Grandison Finney|Charles Finney]] and [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcock]]’s ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' and it concerns a circle of friends including a faded child-star actor, a cultural critic, a hack ghost-writer of autobiographies, and a city official.
