'''Zionism''' is an international [[Jewish political movements|political movement]] that supports a [[homeland for the Jewish People]] in the [[Land of Israel]].<ref>Zionism On The Web, [http://www.zionismontheweb.org/zionism_definitions.htm "Definitions of Zionism"], a compiled collection, Accessed January 10, 2007.</ref>
Although its origins are earlier, the movement was formally established by Austrian journalist [[Theodor Herzl]] in the late nineteenth century. The international movement was eventually successful in establishing the [[Israel|State of Israel]] in [[1948]], as the world's first and only modern [[Jewish State]]. It continues primarily as support for the state and government of Israel and its continuing status as a homeland for the Jewish people.<ref>"An international movement originally for the establishment of a Jewish national or religious community in Palestine and later for the support of modern Israel."

While Zionism is based in part upon [[Judaism|religious tradition]] linking the Jewish people to the Land of Israel, where the concept of Jewish [[nationhood]] is thought to have first evolved somewhere between 1200 BCE and the late [[Second Temple]] era (i.e. up to 70 CE),<ref>"...from Zion, where King David fashioned the first Jewish nation" (Friedland, Roger and Hecht, Richard ''To Rule Jerusalem'', p. 27).</ref><ref>"By the late Second Temple times, when widely held Messianic beliefs were so politically powerful in their implications and repercussions, and when the significance of political authority, territorial sovereignty, and religious belief for the fate of the Jews as a people was so widely and vehemently contested, it seems clear that Jewish nationhood was a social and cultural reality".

==Terminology==

The word "Zionism" itself derived from the word "[[Zion]]" ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: ציון, ''Tzi-yon''), one of the names of [[Jerusalem]] and the [[Land of Israel]], as mentioned in the [[Bible]]. 
<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:1892 Self Emancipation by Birnbaum.jpg|thumb|left|150px|1892 issue of ''Self Emancipation'' by N. Birnbaum describing the principles of Zionism]] -->
It was coined as a term for Jewish [[nationalism]] by [[Austria]]n [[Jew]]ish publisher [[Nathan Birnbaum]], founder of the first nationalist Jewish students' movement ''Kadimah'', in his journal ''Selbstemanzipation'' (''Self Emancipation'') in 1890. (Birnbaum eventually turned against political Zionism and became the first secretary-general of the anti-Zionist [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] movement [[Agudat Israel]].)<ref>De Lange, Nicholas, ''An Introduction to Judaism'', Cambridge University Press (2000), p. 30.  ISBN 0-521-46624-5.</ref>

Since the founding of the State of Israel, the term "Zionism" is generally considered to mean support for Israel as a Jewish [[nation state]]. However, a variety of different, and sometimes competing, [[ideologies]] that support Israel fit under the general category of Zionism, such as [[Religious Zionist Movement|Religious Zionism]], [[Revisionist Zionism]], and [[Labor Zionism]]. Thus, the term is also sometimes used to refer specifically to the programs of these ideologies, such as efforts to encourage [[Aliyah|Jewish emigration to Israel]].

Certain individuals and groups have used the term "Zionism" as a pejorative to justify attacks on Jews. According to historians [[Walter Laqueur]], [[Howard Sachar]] and [[Jack Fischel]] among others, in some cases, the label "Zionist" is also used  as a [[euphemism]] for Jews in general by apologists for [[antisemitism]].<ref>Misuse of the term "Zionism":
*"... behind the cover of "anti-Zionism" lurks a variety of motives that ought to be called by their true name. When, in the 1950s under Stalin, the Jews of the Soviet Union came under severe attack and scores were executed, it was under the banner of anti-Zionism rather than anti-Semitism, which had been given a bad name by Adolf Hitler. When in later years the policy of Israeli governments was attacked as racist or colonialist in various parts of the world, the basis of the criticism was quite often the belief that Israel had no right to exist in the first place, not opposition to specific policies of the Israeli government. Traditional anti-Semitism has gone out of fashion in the West except on the extreme right. But something we might call post-anti-Semitism has taken its place. It is less violent in its aims, but still very real. By and large it has not been too difficult to differentiate between genuine and bogus anti-Zionism. The test is twofold. It is almost always clear whether the attacks are directed against a specific policy carried out by an Israeli government (for instance, as an occupying power) or against the existence of Israel. Secondly, there is the test of selectivity. If from all the evils besetting the world, the misdeeds, real or imaginary, of Zionism are singled out and given constant and relentless publicity, it can be taken for granted that the true motive is not anti-Zionism but something different and more sweeping." ([[Walter Laqueur|Laqueur, Walter]]: ''Dying for Jerusalem: The Past, Present and Future of the Holiest City'' (Sourcebooks, Inc., 2006) ISBN 1-4022-0632-1. p. 55)
*"In late July 1967, Moscow launched an unprecedented propaganda campaign against Zionism as a "world threat." Defeat was attributed not to tiny Israel alone, but to an "all-powerful international force." ... In its flagrant vulgarity, the new propaganda assault soon achieved Nazi-era characteristics. The Soviet public was saturated with racist canards. Extracts from Trofim Kichko's notorious 1963 volume, ''Judaism Without Embellishment'', were extensively republished in the Soviet media. Yuri Ivanov's ''Beware: Zionism'', a book essentially replicated ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', was given nationwide coverage." ([[Howard Sachar]]: ''A History of the Jews in the Modern World'' (Knopf, NY. 2005) p.722

Zionism should be distinguished from [[Territorialism]] which was a Jewish nationalist movement calling for a Jewish homeland, but not necessarily in [[Palestine]].  During the early history of Zionism, a number of proposals were made for settling Jews outside of Europe but these all ultimately were rejected or failed.  The debate over these proposals helped define the nature and focus of the Zionist movement.

==The Historic and Religious Origins of Zionism==
{{main|Jewish history}}
===Biblical Precedents===
The desire of Jews to return to their ancestral homeland is a Jewish theme that first makes its appearance in the [[Torah]]. [[Jacob|Israel]] and his sons went down to Egypt to escape a drought, in Egypt they became a nation and were enslaved. [[Moses]] goes before Pharoh and demands "Let my people go!".  Most of the Torah is devoted to the story of the [[Exodus]] from Egypt which is estimated to have taken place in 1400 BCE and is celebrated annually during [[Passover]]. The Passover meal traditionally ends with the words "Next Year in Jerusalem".

After the conquest of Judea by [[Babylon]] in 641 BCE, the Judeans were exiled to Babylon and the theme recurs. In the book of [[Psalms]] (see [[Psalm 137]]) Jews lamented their exile while Prophets like [[Ezekiel]] foresaw their return. The Bible recounts how, in 538 BCE [[Cyrus (Bible)|Cyrus the Great]] of [[Persia]] conquered Babylon and issued a [[proclamation]] granting the people of Judah their freedom.  50,000 Judeans, led by Zerubabel returned. A second group of 5000 led by [[Ezra]] and [[Nehemiah]] returned to [[Judea]] in 456 BCE.

===The Jewish Decline in Israel===
{{Main|Jewish history}}
{{See also|History of the Jews and the Crusades|inquisition|Bohdan_Khmelnytsky#Khmelnytsky_in_Jewish_history}}
During the [[Hellenistic Age]] many Jews left Judea to live in other parts of the [[Mediterranean]] basin.<ref>[http://classes.maxwell.syr.edu/his301-001/jeishh_diaspora_in_greece.htm The Jewish Diaspora in the Hellenistic Period]</ref>  

The third great Jewish exile is considered to have begun after the destruction of Judea by the Roman Empire in the year [[70]] (after the [[Great Jewish Revolt]]). A second Jewish revolt against the Romans, [[Bar Kokhba's revolt]] of [[135]], led to further dispersal of Jews to other parts of the Empire.<ref>[http://www.wzo.org.il/en/resources/view.asp?id=1527&subject=28 Yearning for Zion] by Briana Simon (WZO)</ref> 

A Jewish presence in the Land of Israel was maintained even after the [[Bar Kokhba]] revolt, and there is evidence of vibrant communities in the first millennium. For example, the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] was created in the centuries following the revolt.  The inventors of [[niqqud|Hebrew vowel-signs]], the [[Masoretes]] (ba'alei hamasorah, Hebrew בעלי המסורה), groups of scribes in 7th and 11th centuries were based primarily in [[Tiberias]] and [[Jerusalem]]. 
 
The [[Crusades]] were devastating for the Jewish presence in Israel{{Fact|date=November 2007}}. The Crusaders [[History of the Jews and the Crusades|massacred Jews]], both on their path across Europe and in the [[Holy Land]].<ref>See The History of the Jews in the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem by Joshua Prawer, 1988, see alo http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_cru1.htm (accessed No 2007)</ref> After the Arab reconquest in the thirteenth century, Sultan [[Baybars]] ravished the land to ensure it could not sustain a large population and would not be attractive to invaders. It remained poor under the [[Ottomans]], who took over in the 16th century and ruled it until the 20th.

Over the centuries, the population of the Holy Land was slowly bolstered by Jews fleeing [[inquisition|Christian persecution]] especially after the ''[[Reconquista]]'' of ''[[Al-Andalus]]'' (the Muslim name of the [[Iberian peninsula]]).  Safed became an important center of [[Kabalah]] and by the end of the 19th century Jews were the largest ethnicity resident in [[Jerusalem]]{{Fact|date=November 2007}}. [[Hebron]] and [[Tiberias]] also had significant Jewish populations.

===Aliyah and the ingathering of the exiles===
{{main|Aliyah}}

Return to the Land of Israel had remained a recurring theme among generations of [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora Jews]], particularly in [[Passover]] and [[Yom Kippur]] prayers which traditionally concluded with, "Next year in Jerusalem", and in the thrice-daily [[Amidah]] (Standing prayer).<ref>"Sound the great shofar for our freedom, raise the banner to gather our exiles and gather us together from the four corners of the earth (Isaiah 11:12) Blessed are you, O Lord, Who gathers in the dispersed of His people Israel."</ref>

''Aliyah'' (immigration to Israel) has always been considered to be a praiseworthy act for Jews according to [[Halakha|Jewish law]], and is included as a commandment in most versions of the [[613 mitzvot|613 commandments]]. 

From the [[Middle Ages]] and onwards, a number of famous Jews (and often their followers) immigrated to the Land of Israel. These included [[Nahmanides]], [[Yechiel of Paris]] with several hundred of his students, [[Yosef Karo]], [[Menachem Mendel of Vitebsk]] and 300 of his followers, and over 500 disciples (and their families) of the [[Vilna Gaon]] known as [[Perushim]], among others.

==Pre-Zionist Initiatives  1799 - 1897==
{{see also|Jewish Emancipation|antisemitism|History of antisemitism}}
===The Enlightenment and the Jews===

The [[age of enlightenment]] in Europe led to an [[18th century|18th]] and [[19th century]] Jewish enlightenment movement in Europe, called the [[Haskalah]]. The [[French Revolution]] and the spread of western liberal ideas among newly emancipated Jews, created for the first time a class of [[secular Jews]] who absorbed the prevailing ideas of [[rationalism]], [[romanticism]] and, most importantly, [[nationalism]]. 

Emancipated Jews who abandoned Judaism, often found themselves still rejected by their host societies and still regarded as 'Jews'. They also found that abandoning their Jewish identity meant loss of their heritage. 

The formation of modern nations in Europe led to changes in the prejudice directed against Jews. What had previously been religious prejudice now became a new phenomena known as [[antisemitism]]. Anti-Semites saw Jews as a racial group as well as a religious group and actively tried to prevent Jews from being given equal rights and citizenship.

===Proto-Zionism===

A precursor to the Zionist movement of the later 1800s occurred with the 1820 attempt by journalist, playwright and American-born diplomat [[Mordecai Manuel Noah]] to establish a Jewish homeland on [[Grand Island, New York]], (north of [[Buffalo, New York]], USA). In 1840s, Noah advocated the "Restoration of the Jews" in the Land of Israel.<ref>Rubinstein, Hilary L. (Ed.),  Rubinstein, William D,  Cohn-Sherbok, Dan, Edelheit, Abraham J. ''The Jews in the Modern World: A History Since 1750'', pp.303, Oxford University Press (2002), ISBN 0-340-69163-8</ref> 
[[Image:pinsker Autoemanicipation.jpg|left|thumb|150px|''[[Auto-Emancipation]]'' by J.L. Pinsker, 1882]] 
[[Moses Hess]]'s 1862 work ''[[Rome and Jerusalem. The Last National Question]]'' argued for the Jews to create a socialist state in [[Palestine]] as a means of settling the [[national question]]. In the same year 1862, German Orthodox Rabbi [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]] published his tractate ''Derishat Zion'', positing that the salvation of the Jews, promised by the Prophets, can come about only by self-help.<ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=56&letter=K Zvi Hirsch Kalischer] (Jewish Encyclopedia)</ref> In 1882 [[Judah Leib Pinsker]] publish the pamphlet ''[[Auto-Emancipation]]'', arguing that Jews would not require emancipation in their own country. 

Pre-Zionist groups were active in the 1880s in [[Eastern Europe]] where emancipation had not occurred to the extent it had in [[Western Europe]] (if at all). The massive [[pogroms]] following the assassination of [[Russian history, 1855-1892|Tsar Alexander II]] made emancipation seem more elusive than ever, and influenced the [[Hovevei Zion|Hibbat Zion]] to actively promote Jewish settlement in Palestine. In 1890, the "Society for the Support of Jewish Farmers and Artisans in Syria and Eretz Israel" (better known as the [[Odessa Committee]]) was officially registered as a [[charitable organization]] in the [[Russian Empire]] and by 1897 it counted over 4,000 members.

[[United States|American]] [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Christian Zionism|Christian Zionists]] such as [[William Eugene Blackstone]] also pursued the Zionist ideal during late 19th century, especially in the American [[Blackstone Memorial]] (1891).

====Agricultural settlements====
{{main|Mikveh Israel Settlement|Bilu|Hovevei Zion}}
[[Image:First aliyah BILU in kuffiyeh.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The first aliyah: [[Biluim]] used to wear the traditional Arab headdress, the [[kaffiyeh]]]]
In the late 1870s, Jewish philanthropists such as the [[Moses Haim Montefiore|Montefiores]] and the [[Rothschild]]s, responded to the persecution of Jews in Eastern Europe by sponsoring agricultural settlements for Russian Jews in Palestine. The Jews who migrated in this period have become known in Zionist history as the [[First Aliyah]].<ref> Scharfstein, Sol, ''Chronicle of Jewish History: From the Patriarchs to the 21st Century'', p.231, KTAV Publishing House (1997), ISBN 0-88125-545-9</ref> ''Aliyah'' is a Hebrew word meaning "ascent," referring to the act of spiritually "ascending" to the Holy Land.

Founded in 1878, [[Petah Tikva]] was the first [[Israeli settlement|Zionist settlement]]. 

[[Rishon LeZion]] was founded on [[31 July]] [[1882]] by a group of ten members of [[Hovevei Zion]] from [[Kharkov]] (today's [[Ukraine]]). Led by [[Zalman David Levontin]], they purchased 835 acres (3.4 km²) of land for this purpose near an [[Arab]] village named [[Uyun Qara]]. The land was owned by Tzvi Leventine and was purchased by the "Pioneers of Jewish Settlement Committee" that was formed in [[Jaffa, Israel|Jaffa]], the port of arrival for many of the immigrants to the area.

In 1890 Palestine, which was part of the [[Ottoman Empire]], was inhabited by about 520,000 people, mostly [[Muslim]]s and [[Christian]] [[Arab]]s&mdash;but including 20-25,000 Jews.

===Non-Jewish Support===

[[Napoleon and the Jews#Napoleon and a Jewish state in Palestine|Napoleon suggested]] the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine as early as 1799, during his invasion of the Levant.<ref>[[Shlomo Avineri|Avineri, Shlomo]], ''The Making of Modern Zionism: Intellectual Origins of the Jewish State'', pp.45, Basic Books (1981), ISBN 0-465-04328-3</ref> In 1873, [[Shah of Persia]] [[Nasser al-Din Shah Qajar]] met with British Jewish leaders, including Sir [[Moses Montefiore]], during his journey to Europe.

Their report was widely published<ref>''A Narrative of a Mission of Inquiry to the Jews from the Church of Scotland in 1839'' (Edinburgh, 1842) ISBN 1-85792-258-1</ref> and was followed by a "Memorandum to Protestant Monarchs of Europe for the restoration of  the Jews to Palestine." In August 1840, ''The Times'' reported that the British government was considering Jewish restoration.<ref name=BritZion/> Lord Lindsay wrote in 1847: "The soil of Palestine still enjoys her sabbaths, and only waits for the return of her banished children, and the application of industry, commensurate with her agricultural capabilities, to burst once more into universal luxuriance, and be all that she ever was in the days of Solomon."<ref>Crawford, A.W.C.

[[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Benjamin Disraeli]] wrote in his article entitled "The Jewish Question is the Oriental Quest" (1877) that within fifty years a nation of one million Jews would reside in Palestine under the guidance of the British. [[Moses Montefiore]] visited the Land of Israel seven times and fostered its development.<ref name=Green2005/>

The [[Treaty of Paris (1856)]] granted Jews and Christians the right to settle in Palestine and opened the doors for Jewish immigration.

===Causes of the Emergence of Zionism===
{{See also|History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union}}

Zionism arose out of a combination of factors, it was a nationalist ideology,  a response to anti-Semitism, an attempt to provide a means of escape from what many Jews saw as unceasing Christian persecution and also an alternative to assimilation, Bolshevism and conversion.

Many Zionist Jews wanted to create their own Jewish Nation in Israel.

Jews in growing numbers began to perceive themselves as a "nation" in the new European sense and were inspired by various national struggles. If European nationas were entitled to a homeland, and if they excluded Jews, why not create a Jewish homeland, one where Jews would be free of persecution?  

Jews in Eastern Europe faced constant [[pogroms]] and [[History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union#Tsarist Russia .281480s-1917.29|persecution in Tzarist Russia]] aimed at driving them out. In response to the Jewish drive for modern education ([[Haskalah]]) the Tzars imposed tight quotas on schools, universities and cities to prevent entry by Jews, the government deliberately organized pogroms with military authorities disarming any Jews who attempted to defend themselves. Consequently, between 1880 and 1928, two million Jews left Eastern Europe, mostly for the USA. A minority went to Palestine. By 1928 nations were increasingly legislating to prevent Jews from entering, particularly in the wake of the [[Bolshevik revolution]] in which Jews were seen as playing a prominent role. Many countries feared that immigrating Jews would bring revolutionary ideas with them.

==Establishment of the Zionist Movement 1897 - 1917==
===Formation===

In 1883, [[Nathan Birnbaum]], nineteen years old, founded ''Kadimah'', the first Jewish Students Association in Vienna. In 1884 the first issue of ''Selbstemanzipation'' or ''Self [[Political emancipation|Emancipation]]'' appeared, completely made by Nathan Birnbaum himself.

The [[Dreyfus Affair]], which erupted in [[France]] in 1894, played a key role in the establishment of the movement. Jews were profoundly shocked to see the depth of anti-Semitism in a country which they thought of as the home of enlightenment and liberty. Among those who witnessed the Affair was an Austro-Hungarian (born in [[Budapest]], lived in [[Vienna]]) Jewish journalist, [[Theodor Herzl]], who published his pamphlet ''[[Der Judenstaat]]'' ("The Jewish State") in 1896 and [[altneuland]] (Old-New Land) in 1897. He described the Affair as a turning point&mdash;prior to the Affair, Herzl had been [[anti-Zionist]], afterwards he became ardently [[pro-Zionist]]. Herzl believed in a Jewish state for the Jewish nation; in that way the Jews, he argued, could become a people like all other peoples and anti-semitism would cease to exist.<ref>[[Hannah Arendt]], 1946, ' ''Der Judenstaat'' 50 years later', also published in: Hannah Arendt, ''The Jew as pariah'', NY, 1978</ref><ref>N. Finkelstein, 2002, ''Image and reality of the Israel-Palestine conflict'', 2nd ed., p. 7-12</ref> 

In [[Austria]], [[Theodor Herzl|Herzl]] took the idea of political Zionism and infused it with a new and practical urgency. He brought the [[World Zionist Organization]] into being and, together with Nathan Birnbaum, planned its First Congress at [[Basel]] in 1897<ref>[http://fusion.dalmatech.com/%7Eadmin24/files/zionism_in-britishpalestine.pdf Zionism & The British In Palestine], by [[Arjun Sethi|Sethi,Arjun]] (University of Maryland) January 2007, accessed May 20, 2007.</ref>

====The objectives of Zionism====
During the congress, the following agreement, commonly known as the Basel Program, was reached:

Zionism seeks to establish a home for the Jewish people in Eretz-Israel secured under public law [that is to seek legal permission from the rulers for Jewish migration]. The Congress contemplates the following means to the attainment of this end:
#The promotion by appropriate means of the settlement in Eretz-Israel of Jewish farmers, artisans, and manufacturers.
#The organization and uniting of the whole of Jewry by means of appropriate institutions, both local and international, in accordance with the laws of each country.
#The strengthening and fostering of Jewish national sentiment and national consciousness.
#Preparatory steps toward obtaining the consent of governments, where necessary, in order to reach the goals of Zionism.<ref>[http://www.mideastweb.org/basleprogram.htm The Basle Program. Resolutions of the First Zionist Congress] August 30, 1897 (mideastweb)</ref></blockquote>
</blockquote>

====The organizational structure of the Zionist movement====
After the First Zionist Congress, the [[World Zionist Organization]] met every year for the first four years, later they gathered every second year till the Second World War. After the war the Congress met every four years until present time.
[[Image:Herzelandsecondcongress.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Theodor Herzl]] addresses the Second Zionist Congress in 1898.]]
Congress delegates were elected by local committee membership (members were required to pay a due known as a "Shekel"). The congress then elected a 30 man executive council which in turn elected the movement's leader.  The movement was democratic and women had the right to vote (in 1914 still absent in Great Britain).

The [[WZO]]'s initial strategy was to obtain permission of the [[Ottoman Empire#Sultans|Ottoman Sultan]] [[Abd-ul-Hamid II]] to allow systematic Jewish settlement in Palestine. The good offices of the German Emperor, [[William II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], were sought, but nothing came of this. Instead, the WZO pursued a strategy of building a homeland through persistent small-scale immigration, and the founding of such bodies as the [[Jewish National Fund]] in 1901 and the [[Anglo-Palestine Bank]] in 1903.

===Early Arguments===
====Cultural Zionism and Opposition to Herzl====
{{main|Cultural Zionism}}
{{see also|Revival of the Hebrew language|Ahad HaAm}}
Herzl's strategy relied on winning support from foreign rulers, in particular the [[Ottoman Sultan]].  He also made efforts to cultivate Orthodox, Rabbinical support.  Rabbinical support depended on the Zionist movement making no challenges to existing Jewish tradition. In response to this an opposition movement arose which emphasized the need for a revolution in Jewish thought.
While Herzl believed that the Jews needed to return to their historic homeland as a refuge from anti-Semitism, the opposition, led  by [[Ahad HaAm]], became known as Cultural Zionists and believed that the Jews must revive and foster a Jewish national culture and, in particular strove to revive the Hebrew language.

====The Uganda Proposal====
In 1903 the British Colonial Secretary, [[Joseph Chamberlain]] suggested the [[British Uganda Program]], land for a Jewish state in "[[Uganda]]" (in today's [[Kenya]]). Herzl initially rejected the idea, preferring Palestine, but after the April 1903 [[Kishinev pogrom]] Herzl introduced a controversial proposal to the Sixth Zionist Congress to investigate the offer as a temporary measure for Russian Jews in danger. Notwithstanding its emergency and temporary nature, the proposal still proved very divisive, and widespread opposition to the plan was fueled by a walkout led by the Russian Jewish delegation to the Congress. Nevertheless, a majority voted to establish a committee for the investigation of the possibility, and it was not dismissed until the Seventh Zionist Congress in 1905. After that it was agreed that Palestine was the sole focus of Zionist aspirations.

====The death of Herzl====
In 1904, Herzl died unexpectedly at the age of 44. After his death leadership was taken over by [[David Wolfsohn]] who led the movement until 1911. During this period the movement made little international progress, failing to win support among the [[Young Turks]], following the collapse of the Ottoman Regime.

By this time Cultural Zionism was accepted by most Zionists and a schism was beginning to develop between the Zionist movement and Orthodox Judaism.
===Anti-Zionism and Alternative Proposals===
{{main|Anti-Zionism}}
====Orthodox Jewish Opposition====
Under Herzl's leadership Zionism won orthodox Jewish support, however cultural and socialist Zionists increasingly broke with tradition and used language contrary to the outlook of most religious Jewish communities. As a result many religious organizations opposed Zionism, both on the grounds that it was a secular movement and on the grounds that any attempt to re-establish Jewish rule in Israel by [[Agency (philosophy)|human agency]] was blasphemous, since (in their view) only the [[Jewish eschatology|Messiah]] could accomplish this.<ref>"Most Orthodox Jews originally rejected Zionism because they believed the Jews must await the Messiah to restore them to nationhood." ''Settings of Silver: An Introduction to Judaism. Stephen M. Wylen, 2000, Paulist Press, page 356</ref>

[[Orthodox Jews]] thus retreated into the traditional [[Judaism|Jewish belief]] that the Land of Israel was given to the ancient [[Israelite]]s by [[God]], and that while the right of the Jews to that land was permanent and inalienable, the Messiah must appear before Israel could return to Jewish control. 

Prior to [[the Holocaust]], [[Reform Judaism]] rejected Zionism as inconsistent with the requirements of Jewish citizenship in the diaspora.<ref>"Reform Jews originally rejected Zionism as inconsistent with the acceptance of Jewish citizenship in the Diaspora." ''Settings of Silver: An Introduction to Judaism. Stephen M. Wylen, 2000, Paulist Press, page 356</ref>

It should be noted that while Zionism aroused [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] Orthodox antagonism in Europe (probably due to Modernist European antagonism to organized religion), in the Islamic world Orthodox Judaism eagerly embraced Zionism.

====Support for other homelands====
Before 1917 some Zionist leaders took seriously proposals for Jewish homelands in places other than Palestine. Herzl's ''Der Judenstaat'' argued for a Jewish state in either Palestine, "our ever-memorable historic home", or [[Argentina]], "one of the most fertile countries in the world".
when the Zionist Movement rejected the Uganda Proposal, the [[Jewish Territorialist Organization]] (ITO) led by [[Israel Zangwill]] split off from the main Zionist movement. The [[territorialism|territorialists]] attempted to establish a Jewish homeland wherever possible, but went into decline after 1917 and the ITO was dissolved in 1925. 
====Communism ====
Zionisms most serious rival in Eastern Europe was the [[General Jewish Labor Union]], otherwise known as the [[Bund]], which helped promote the Communist Revolution in Russia. The Bund called for [[Jewish Autonomism|Jewish Autonomy]] within Eastern Europe and promoted [[Yiddish]] as the Jewish language. Bund supporters regarded Zionism as a form of [[Bourgeois nationalism]].
However, as was the case with Orthodox Judaism, while the leadership opposed Zionism (and Orthodox Judaism), in practise the rank and file often had ties with other forms of Jewish life including Zionism.  The Bund thus indirectly led to development of Socialist Zionism, which competed with it for Jewish allegiances.

===Growth of the Zionist community in Israel===
In Palestine, the small Zionist community began to expand. Widespread pogroms accompanied the [[1905 Russian Revolution]], inspired by the [[Black Hundreds]]. This and the desire of many young Jews to avoid conscription for the [[Russo-Japanese war]] led to a wave of immigrants to Palestine. The new wave of immigrants [[Revival of the Hebrew language|resurrected the Hebrew Language]]. 
[[Image:TelAviv-Founding.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Tel Aviv]], its name taken from a work by Theodor Herzl. It was founded on empty dunes, purchased from Arabs, north of the existing city of Yafo. This photograph is of the auction of the first lots in 1909.]]
Outside Jaffa a new town called, [[Tel-Aviv]] was established, the new town had a modern school, the [[Herzliya Hebrew High School]], which was the first modern school to teach only in Hebrew. 
In Jerusalem foundations were laid for a Jewish University (the [[Hebrew University]]), one which would teach only in Hebrew and which the Zionists hoped would help them prove their usefulness to the Turks (this did not come to fruition until 1918). In Haifa the cornerstone was laid for a Jewish Technical school (the [[Technion]]).

The 1911 edition of the [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] evidenced the movement's growing popularity: "there is hardly a nook or corner of the Jewish world in which Zionistic societies are not to be found."<ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=132&letter=Z&search=Zionism Zionism article (section ''Wide Spread of Zionism'')] by Richard Gottheil in the [[Jewish Encyclopedia]], 1911</ref> <br /> Zionism was not a purely [[Ashkenazi]] phenomenon. The first Zionist branches in the Arab world opened in [[Morrocco]] only a few years after the first Zionist conference, and the movement was popular among Jews living in Arab states.  A number of the founders of the city of [[Tel-Aviv]] were Moroccan Jewish immigrants and there was significant early migration from [[Yemenite Jews| Yemen]] (10% of Yemenite Jews moved to the Holy Land between 1880 and 1914) and [[Bukharan Jews| Uzbekistan]].

====Socialist Zionism: a new Zionist movement====
{{main|Socialist Zionism}}
{{see also|Kibbutz Movement|Kibbutz}}
{{Unreferencedsection|date=May 2007}}

The chief rival to Zionism among young Jews in Eastern Europe was the [[socialist movement]]. Many Jews were abandoning Judaism in favour of [[Communism]] or supported the [[Bund]], a [[Jewish socialist movement]] which called for [[Jewish Autonomism|Jewish autonomy]] in Eastern Europe and promoted [[Yiddish]] as the Jewish language.

Opposition to this led to the emergence of a new zionist movement, the socialist Zionists, who believed that the Jews' centuries of being oppressed in anti-Semitic societies had reduced Jews to a meek, vulnerable, despairing existence which invited further anti-Semitism. They argued that Jews should redeem themselves from their history by becoming farmers, workers, and soldiers in a country of their own. These socialist Zionists rejected religion as perpetuating a "[[Diaspora]] mentality" among the Jewish people and established rural communes in Israel called "[[Kibbutzim]]". Major theoreticians of Socialist Zionism included [[Moses Hess]], [[Nahum Syrkin]], [[Ber Borochov]] and [[Aaron David Gordon]] and leading figures in the movement included [[David Ben-Gurion]] and [[Berl Katznelson]]. 

Socialist Zionism became a dominant force in Israel, however it caused the schism between some groups of [[Orthodox Jews]] such as [[Neturei Karta]] and Zionism to grow.

====Early Zionism and the non-Jewish population of Palestine====
It is, in retrospect, unclear how familiar Zionist leaders and advocates were with contemporary Palestine.{{Fact|date=November 2007}} During the movement's formative stages, Zionist negotiators with stronger political powers (such as the [[United Kingdom|British]]) corresponded enthusiastically while remaining silent about the inhabitants of Palestine, who numbered just under half a million during the late [[19th century|nineteenth century]].<ref name="pop">{{cite book | title=The Population of Palestine: Population History and Statistics of the Late Ottoman Period and the Mandate| last=McCarthy| first=Justin| date=1990| pages=26| publisher=Columbia University}}</ref> Michael Bar-Zohar, the author of [[David Ben-Gurion|Ben-Gurion]]'s biography, attempted to explain this dichotomy: <blockquote>Whatever became of the slogan: "A people without a land returns to a land without a people"? The simple truth was that Palestine was not an empty land, and the Jews were only a small minority of its population. In the days of the empire building, the Western powers had dismissed natives as an inconsequential factor in determining whether or not to settle a territory with immigrants. Even after the [[World War I|[First] World War]], the concept of self-determination [...] was still reserved exclusively for the developed world.<ref name="gurionbio">{{cite book | title=Ben-Gurion: A Biography| last=Bar-Zohar| first=Michael| date=1986| pages=45| publisher=Adama Books}}</ref></blockquote>

According to Flapan, from the beginning Zionism ignored the Palestinians as a [[nation]] but chose to see the Palestinian Arabs as part of the larger Arab nation.<ref>Simha Flapan, 'Zionism and the Palestinians', 1979, ISBN 0-85664-499-4, p. 11</ref> This supported the Zionists; claim of a preemptive right to the Palestinian territory.<ref>N. Finkelstein, 2002, 'Image and reality of the Israel-Palestine conflict', 2nd ed., p. 12-16</ref> 

[[Chaim Weizmann]], Israel's first president, indicated that the British did not view the welfare of the Arab residents highly, and according to [[Arthur Ruppin]], formerly in charge of the [[Jewish Agency for Israel|Jewish Agency]], Zionist leaders failed to grasp the nature and importance of the Arab question. Ruppin told the Agency in May 1936: "Dr Weizmann once told me how he received the Balfour Declaration. And when I asked him, 'And what did you think then in reality on the Arab question?' he replied, 'The English told us that [there are] some hundred of thousands [of] blacks there, and this has no importance.' This shows me that at that time our leaders didn't have a clue regarding the Arab question, and even much later they relegated this question to the margins."<ref>Heller, Yosef. ''Bama'vak Lemedinah, Hamediniyut Hatzionit Bashanim 1936-1948'' [''The Struggle for the State: The Zionist Policy 1936-1948''], Jerusalem, 1984, p.140, quoting [[Arthur Ruppin]]'s speech to the Jewish Agency Executive, May 20, 1936. The original speech is believed to have been in German; a copy of the original is held in the [[Central Zionist Archives]] in Jerusalem. This passage from the speech was translated into Hebrew. The English translation published here, based on the Hebrew version, is by Yosef Heller for Wikipedia, May 2007.</ref>

Under the Ottomans, Palestine's Arab population mostly saw themselves as Ottoman subjects or as Moslems and, when they concerned themselves with Zionists, they generally assumed the movement (whose objectives they feared) would fail. After the Young Turk revolution in 1908, Arab Nationalism grew rapidly in the area and Arabs Naitonalists were generally more alert to Zionism which they regarded as a threat, although a minority perceived Zionism as providing a path to modernity.<ref> Mohammed Muslih, ''The Origins of Palestinian Nationalism'', New York 1988, chapter 3, See also Yehoshua Porath, ''The Emergence of the Palestinian-Arab National Movement 1918-1929'', introduction. </ref>

===The Zionist Movement in World War I and the Balfour Declaration===
{{Main|Balfour Declaration}}
In the search for support, Herzl made most progress with the Kaiser, meeting with him and joining the Kaiser on his 1898 trip to Palestine <ref>"Herzl's Journeys in Palestine and Egypt" by Desmond Stewart in the ''Journal of Palestine Studies'', Vol. 3, No. 3 (Spring, 1974), pp. 18-38 </ref> At the oubreak of war in 1914 the offices of the World Zionist Organization were located in Berlin and Zionist policy was to maintain strict neutrality and "to demonstrate complete loyalty to Turkey".<ref> Jehuda Reinharz, "Chaim Weizmann, the Making of a Statesman", page 10. Oxford 1993</ref>

At this time England had a rapidly growing Jewish minority.  Some 150,000 Jews migrated there from Russia in the period 1881 - 1914.  There was pressure from British voters to halt the influx as well as a strong love for the [[Old Testament]] in British society which made Zionism an attractive solution.<ref> Estimates of the number of Jewish migrants vary widely raning from 100,000 to 300,000. This figure is taken from the Jewish Museum website: http://www.jewishmuseum.org.uk/collections/theme3.asp accessed Nov 2007</ref>

Following Turkey's entry into the [[First World War]], most Zionists were expelled from Palestine{{Fact|date=November 2007}}. In response a Polish Zionist, [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]], had the idea of creating a Jewish division in the British army.  This became known as the [[Jewish Legion]] and was mainly staffed by Zionist volunteers. The Jewish Legion participated in the 1917 British invasion of Palestine and Jabotinsky was awarded for bravery.

The most prominent Russian-Zionist migrant to Britain was [[Chaim Weizmann]]. In 1915 the British [[Shell Crisis of 1915|government fell]] as a result of its inability to manufacture sufficient artillery shells for the war effort. In the new Government [[Lloyd-George]] became the minister responible for armaments. Lloyd George was a [[Christian-Zionist]] and had represented the Zionist movement in its dealings with the British Government over the Uganda proposal. 

Weizmann developed a means for mass production of [[Acetone]] a critical ingredient of explosives that Britain was unable to manufacture. He did not ask for any payment for his efforts.  According to Lloyd-George he said he expected no payment, just the rights over Palestine...<ref>Chaim Weizmann, The Making of a Statesman by Jehuda Reinharz, chapter 2</ref> Weizmann became a close associate of [[Lloyd George]] (Prime-Minister from 1916) and the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] (foreign minister from 1916), [[Arthur Balfour]]. 

In 1917, the British Foreign Secretary, [[Arthur Balfour]], made the famous [[Balfour Declaration, 1917|Declaration]] in favour of "the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people." The Declaration used the word "home" rather than "state," and specified that its establishment must not "prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine."

When the Balfour Declaration was issued in 1917, [[Edwin Montagu]], the only Jew in the British Cabinet, "was passionately opposed to the declaration on the grounds that (a) it was a capitulation to anti-Semitic bigotry, with its suggestion that Palestine was the natural destination of the Jews, and that (b) it would be a grave cause of alarm to the Muslim world."<ref>Hitchens, "Love, Poverty, and War" 327</ref>, the reference to the rights of non-Jews in Palestine was thus demanded by the only Jew in the British cabinet.

==The British Mandate and the struggle for Palestine 1918 - 1939 ==
===Weizmann becomes leader===
{{Main|Chaim Weizmann}}
After the war, in 1921, Weizmann was elected president of the [[World Zionist Organisation]] in recognition of his role in creating the Balfour Declaration. He remained in this position until 1931. From 1931 to 1935 the WZO was presided by [[Nahum Sokolov]] (who had also spent the first world war in Britain). Weizmann resumed presidency of the WZO in 1935 and led it until 1946.

===The League of Nations endorses Zionism===

[[Image:Tarbut.jpg|thumb|left|Poster from the Zionist Tarbut schools of [[Poland]] in the 1930s. Zionist parties were very active in [[Poland|Polish]] politics. In the 1922 Polish elections, Zionists held 24 seats of a total of 35 Jewish parliament members.]]

After the defeat and dismantling of the Ottoman Empire in 1918, the [[League of Nations]] endorsed the Balfour Declaration with the establishment of the [[League of Nations mandate|British Mandate]] for Palestine (text: [http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/mideast/palmanda.htm]).

In addition to the promises made by Balfour, the League required Britain to create a representative body, the [[Jewish Agency]], which would administer Jewish affairs in Palestine.

The Zionist movement entered a new phase of activity. Its priorities were the escalation of Jewish settlement in Palestine, the building of the institutional foundations of a Jewish state, raising funds for these purposes, and persuading &mdash; or forcing &mdash; the British authorities not to take any steps which would lead to Palestine moving towards independence as an Arab-majority state. The 1920s did see a steady growth in the Jewish population and the construction of state-like Jewish institutions, but also saw the emergence of Palestinian Arab nationalism and growing resistance to Jewish immigration.
===Expansion of the Movement===
The success of Zionism in getting international recognition for its project, led to growth in the membership and developmenmt of new forms of Zionism.
====Religious Zionism====
{{main|Religious Zionism}}
In the 1920s and 1930s, a small but vocal group of religious Jews began to develop the concept of [[Religious Zionism]] under such leaders as Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] (the first Chief Rabbi of Palestine) and his son Zevi Judah, and gained substantial following during the latter half of the 20th century.  Kook was concerned that growing secularization of Zionism and antagonism towards it from the Orthodox Jews would lead to a schism.  He therefore sought to create a brand of Judaism which would serve as a bridge between Orthodoxy and secular Jews.
====Revisionist Zionism====
{{main|Revisionist Zionism}}
The Revisionist Zionists were a group led by Jabotinsky who advocated pressing Britain to allow mass Jewish emigration and the formation of a Jewish Army in Palestine.  The army would force the Arab population to accept mass Jewish migration and promote British interests in the region. 

Revisionist Zionism was detested by the Socialist Zionist movement which saw them as being influenced by [[Fascism]] and the movement caused a great deal of concern among Arab Palestinians. After the [[1929 Palestine riots|1929 Arab riots]], the British banned Jabotinsky from entering Palestine. 

Revisionism was popular in Poland but lacked large support in Palestine. In 1935 the Revisionists left the Zionist movement, rejoining in 1946.

===Jewish Opposition to Zionism between the wars===
International Jewish opinion remained divided on the merits of the Zionist project. While many Jews in Europe and the United States argued that a Jewish homeland was not needed because Jews were able to live in the democratic countries of the West as equal citizens, others supported Zionism. 

Many Jews who embraced [[socialism]] and [[proletarian internationalism]] opposed Zionism as a form of [[bourgeois nationalism]]. The [[General Jewish Labor Union]] (Bund), which represented socialist Jews in Eastern Europe, was anti-Zionist. Some Jewish factions tried to blend [[Jewish Autonomism]] with Zionism, favoring Jewish self-rule in Eastern-Europe. 

The Communist parties, which attracted substantial Jewish support during the 1920s and 1930s, were vigorously anti-Zionist. In 1928, the [[Soviet Union]] established a [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]] in the [[Russian Far East]] but the effort failed to meet expectations and as of 2002 Jews constitute only about 1.2% of its population.<ref>Mark Tolts: [http://www.jafi.org.il/education/100/concepts/demography/Tolts_Article1.pdf The Post-Soviet Jewish Population in Russia and the World.] Published in: Jews in Russia and Eastern Europe, 2004, No. 1 (52). p.51</ref>

===Arab attitudes to Zionism===
Though there had already been Arab protests to the Ottoman authorities in the 1880s against land sales to foreign Jews, the most serious opposition began in the 1890s after the full scope of the Zionist enterprise became known. There was a general sense of threat. This sense was heightened in the early years of the 20th century by Zionist attempts to develop an economy from which Arab people were largely excluded, such as the "Hebrew labor" movement which, in an effort to prevent Zionist settlements turning into a standard colonial enterprise and to secure the creation of a Jewish proletariat, campaigned against the employment of cheap Arab labour. 
The creation of Palestine in 1918 and the [[Balfour Declaration, 1917|Balfour Declaration]] greatly increased Arab fears.
[[Image:FeisalPartyAtVersaillesCopy.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Faisal I of Iraq]]]]
In 1919 King [[Faisal I of Iraq]] (who was then King of Syria, before the French expelled him), signed the [[Faisal-Weizmann Agreement]]. He wrote: "We [[Arabs]], especially the educated among us, look with the deepest sympathy on the Zionist movement. Our delegation here in Paris is fully acquainted with the proposals submitted yesterday by the Zionist organization to the Peace Conference, and we regard them as moderate and proper."  

Palestinian Arab nationalism was motivated by anti-Zionism more then any other factor and developed in opposition to Zionism. Faisal's agreement with Weizmann led the Palestinian-Arab population to reject the Syrian-Arab-Nationalist movement (in which many previously placed their hopes) and to agitate for Palestine to become a state governed by the Arab majority, in particular they demanded an elected assembly. <ref> The Emergence of the Palestinian-Arab National Movement 1918-1929, Yehoshua Porath, London 1974, chapter 2</ref>    

The Arabs in Palestine were led by two main camps, the [[Nashashibi]]s led by [[Raghib al-Nashashibi]], who was Mayor of Jerusalem from 1920 - 1934 were moderates who sought dialogue with the British and the Jews.  The Nashashibis were overshadowed by the [[al-Husayni]]s who came to dominate Palestinian-Arab politics in the years before 1948. 

====The Mufti and the emergence of Palestinian Nationalism====
{{main|Mohammad Amin al-Husayni}}
[[Image:MAal-Husayni.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Mohammad Amin al-Husayni]]]]
After 1920 [[Haj Amin al-Husseini]] became the focus of Palestinian opposition to Zionism. In 1920 he was instrumental in causing [[1920 Palestine riots|religious riots]]. In 1921 the British made him [[Mufti of Jerusalem]]. 

The Mufti was concerned that Jews were seeking to rebuild the [[Jewish Temple]] on the site of the [[Dome of the Rock]] and [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] and responded by trying to gain control of the [[Kotel]] saying it was [[al-Buraq|sacred to the Moslems]]. 

Religious tension (over the Kotel), international economic crisis (affecting crop prices) and nationalist tension (over Zionist immigration) led to the [[1929 Palestine riots]]. In these religious-nationalist riots Jews were [[1929 Hebron massacre|massacred in Hebron]] and the survivors were expelled from the town. Devastation also took place in [[Safed]] and Jerusalem. This violence was directed against the non-Zionist orthodox communities; Zionist communities were able to defend themselves and had established defence organizations.  As a result the orthodox community in Palestine was increasingly dependant on Zionist support.

A [[Shaw Report|British commission]] investigated the riots and throughout his interview the Mufti held a copy of the [[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]].<ref>Palestine Commission on the Disturbances of August 1929, Minutes of Evidence (London 1930), Vol 2 pg 539:13,430, pg 527:13,107 (interview on 4/12/1929).</ref>  The Mufti thus also held violently antisemitic views.
 
In 1936 the [[Supreme Muslim Council]] in Palestine, led by the Mufti, instigated an [[1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine|Arab uprising]] which lasted for three years and significantly changed British attitudes. During the revolt the Mufti was forced to flee to Iraq where he was involved in a pro-Nazi coup during which the Jewish areas of Baghdad were subjected to a [[Farhud|pogrom]]. In May 1941 he issued a [[fatwa]] for a holy war against Britain.<ref>Hirszowicz, op. cit. p 82 - 83</ref>  After the British reoccupied Iraq the Mufti joined the Nazis, serving with the [[13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian)|Waffen SS in Bosnia]]. During the war he made requests to "the German government to bomb Tel Aviv."<ref>Lewis (1995), 351.</ref>

In 1948 the Mufti returned to Egypt from where he made his way to Palestine and assumed command of the Palestinian-Arab forces. In his radio broadcasts to the Palestinian-Arabs he called for Genocide ("Kill Jews wherever you find them").<ref>The Mufti of Jerusalem by Maurice Pearlman (1947).</ref>

===Zionist attitudes toward the Arabs===

One issue fatally divided Arab and Jew in Palestine: immigration. Jews could not compromise over emmigration as for them Palestine was intended as a haven from persecution, particularly after the rise of the Nazis. The Arabs for their part could not compromise on migration because to do so would effectively end their majority in Palestine. Both sides distrusted and feared the others long term ambitions.

Most Zionists were Europeans, and although Jews were generally less racist then the average European of the time (Jews were prominent in fighting racism around the world), European-Jewish public opinion generally reflected attitudes of the European societies in which they lived, which at this time was highly prejudiced.

A wide range of opinion could be found among Zionist leaders after 1920. The division between these camps did not match the main threads in Zionist politics as cleanly as is often portrayed.{{Fact|date=November 2007}} 

====Weizmann====
In [[Chaim Weizmann]]'s view Palestine was a Jewish and not an Arab country.<ref>Simha Flapan, 'Zionism and the Palestinians', 1979, ISBN 0-85664-499-4, p. 17-83</ref> Weizmann did  not view the Palestinians as a separate people but as a part of the larger Arab people. Weizmann preferred to negotiate a political solution primarily with the British, and sometimes with non-Palestinian Arabs, but not with the Palestinians themselves.<ref>Simha Flapan, 'Zionism and the Palestinians', 1979, ISBN 0-85664-499-4, p. 70</ref> Weizmann was opposed the creation of representative institutions in Palestine as these would have enabled the Arab majority to halt Jewish emigration.

====Jabotinsky====
[[Vladimir Jabotinsky]], the leader of the [[Revisionist Zionism|Revisionist Zionists]], thought the Arabs were completely irrelevant to the question of Zionism except as enemies. In his view the conflict with the Arabs was natural and inevitable and could not be solved until the Zionists could face the Arabs with an 'iron wall' of Jewish power.<ref>Simha Flapan, 'Zionism and the Palestinians', 1979, ISBN 0-85664-499-4, p. 113</ref> 

====Ben-Gurion====
The situation with socialist Zionists such as [[David Ben-Gurion]] was ambiguous. In public, Ben-Gurion upheld the official position of his party that denied the necessity of force in achieving Zionist goals. Unlike Weizmann Ben-Gurion did have a realistic view of the strong attachment of Arab Palestinians to the Palestinian soil. In 1938 he said: 'In our political argument abroad we minimize Arab opposition to us. But let us not ignore the truth among ourselves. [...] A people which fights against [what it conceives as] the usurpation of its land will not tire so easily.'<ref>Simha Flapan, 'Zionism and the Palestinians', 1979, ISBN 0-85664-499-4, p. 141</ref>

According to Flapan Ben-Gurions assesment of Arab feelings led him to an even more militant line on the need to build up Jewish military strength: 'I believe in our power, in our power which will grow, and if it will grow agreement will come...'.<ref>Simha Flapan, 'Zionism and the Palestinians', 1979, ISBN 0-85664-499-4, p. 142-144</ref>

====Bi-National support====
{{see also|Brit Shalom|Binational_solution#Historic_development}}
A minority of Zionists sought to create a bi-national state, however this approach was unpopular with both Arabs and Jews.
The Socialist Zionist movement, [[Hashomer Hatzair]] supported a binational solution.

====Zionist Para-Military Organizations====
In response to Arab attacks under the Turks, the Zionists in Palestine established [[Hashomer]] (the Guardian), a self-defence organization.  After the Jaffa Riots, an organization of Jewish Legion veterans was created, [[Haganah]] (Defence) to defend Jewish communities against rioters.
In 1931,  following the Revisionist Zionist departure from the Zionist Movement a group of revisionists left Haganah and founded the [[Irgun]] Tzvai Leumi (National Military Organization), also known as Etzel.

===British Immigration Restrictions===
British support for Zionism was never unequivocal and the issue was periodically debated in [[British House of Commons|Parliament]]. Following the Arab riots in 1922, Colonial Secretary [[Winston Churchill]], decided to remove the Transjordan area of Palestine and use it to fulfill British promises to [[Sharif Hussein]], making [[Abdullah I of Jordan|one of his sons]] King of [[Transjordan]].

Churchill also imposed restrictions on Jewish migration.  An annual quota was established for Jewish migration. Certificates allowing migration were distributed by the Jewish Agency, however Jews with 1000 Pounds in cash or Jewish professionals with 500 Pounds in cash could emigrate freely. Churchill's reforms made it hard for [[Arab Jews]], [[Orthodox Jews]] and [[Revisionist Zionists]] to migrate to Palestine as the Jewish Agency was dominated by European Zionists, and increasingly by Socialist Zionists.
Immigration restrictions did, however mean that Jewish immigrants to Palestine had to prove their loyalty and dedication by spending years preparing for migraiton.

====The rise of Hitler and illegal migration====
{{See also|Hitler's rise to power|Fifth Aliyah}}
The rise to power of [[Adolf Hitler]] in Germany in 1933 produced a powerful new impetus for Zionism. The claim that Jews could live securely as minorities in Christian societies was deeply undermined. At the same time most countries closed their doors to Jewish immigration. A [[Aliyah#Fifth Aliyah (1929-1939)|wave of migrants]] headed for Palestine. Those unable to pay the fees demanded by the British had to join waiting lists and spent years learning Hebrew and taking agricultural training. 

Nazi efforts to push Jews out of Germany were undermined by the refusal to allow Jews to take their property with them. In response [[Arlozorov]], negotiated an agreement with the Nazis, the [[Haavara agreement]],  whereby Jews could export capital goods to Palestine.  In Palestine the goods were sold and the income given to the migrants. As a result of this agreement Arlozorov was assassinated by the Irgun.

In 1934 the Revisionist started organizing [[Aliyah Bet|illegal emmigraiton]] to Palestine as they felt that the allocation of certificates discriminated against their supporters. The Jewish population of Palestine now began to rise fast and the financial influx led to an economic boom, however the rapid rise of Jewish migration led to an [[Arab revolt]]. In 1938 the pressure in Europe led the left-wing Zionists to organize illegal immigration too.

==The Struggle Against Britain and the Nazis 1939 - 1948==
===The 1939 White Paper and the British break with Zionism===
{{main|1939 White Paper}}
As elsewhere in Europe, the 1930s saw an increase in [[antisemitism]]. Labour leader, [[Oswald Mosley]] formed a party called the [[British Union of Fascists]], which claimed that "the Jews" were leading Britain to war and campaigned for peace with Germany.<ref> Hurrah for the Blackshirts, Martin Pugh, Pimlico 2007</ref> British support for Zionism was also undermined by the Palestinian-Arab revolt and concern that millions of Jews would soon be seeking entry to Palestine.

In 1939 the British issued a [[1939 White Paper|White Paper]], announcing that they were withdrawing from the Balfour Declaration. A [[Jewish National Home]] now existed and their obligations were fulfilled. Further migration would be harmful to the Arab population.
A further 10,000 Jews a year would be admitted, from 1939 - 1944 as well as a one time allowance of 25,000 in lieu of the situation in Europe. After that Jewish migration would require agreement of the Arab majority (by this time Jews were about a third of the population). The British promised Palestine independence by 1949.

The British were concerned about maintaining Arab support as Fascist propaganda was [[Fascism as an international phenomenon#Overtures to Muslims and Arab countries|targetting the Arab world]] (and winning support).<ref>Mussolini's Propaganda Abroad: Subversion in the Mediterranean and the Middle East, 1935-1940 by Manuela Williams, Routledge 2006 
</ref> Jewish support in the fight against Fascism was guaranteed.<ref>Raul Hilberg, The Destruction of the European Jews, (1961) New Viewpoihnts, New York 1973 p.716 </ref> In Palestine, Zionists increasingly viewed the British as an enemy, however the fight against the Nazis was deemed more important. In 1940 a group, later known as [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]], left the Irgun and began fighting the British.

===State of the Zionist Movement on the eve of World War II===
{{The Holocaust|state=uncollapsed}}
In 1938-39 the Zionist movement had 1,040,540 members in 61 countries.  Zionism was banned in the [[USSR]] and Turkey. A significant proportion of the movement's supporters originally came from the USSR, however under [[Stalin]], Zionism and Orthodox Judaism were banned and Jews were prominent among the victims of the [[Soviet genocide]]. 

The following figures relate to the last pre-war Zionist congress in Geneva, 1939. Elections for the congress were held in 48 countries and 529 delegates attended. Members of the movement voted for the parties. Each party submitted a delegate list. Seats were distributed to the parties according to the number of votes they obtained and candidates elected in the order in which they were named on the list. This system today forms the basis for Israeli elections.

===Zionism during the Holocaust===
{{main|Holocaust}}
During the Holocaust Europe's Jews were cut off from the outside world and systematically impoverished, starved and eventually murdered. Where Jews did succeed in fighting the Nazis, Zionists were prominent in the resistance. 

The [[Warsaw Ghetto uprising]] was commanded by a Zionist, [[Mordechaj Anielewicz]] and Zionists played a leading role in the struggle.  The uprising's survivors eventually made their way to Palestine and founded two Kibutzim: [[Lohamey ha-Geta'ot]] and [[Yad Mordechai]].

In Palestine the Zionist leadership instructed all able bodied Jews to volunteer for the British Army.  In addition there was an effort to parachute fighters into Europe, though little came of this.Fearing a Nazi invasion the Jewish community prepared for a final stand to be made against the Nazis.<ref> Tom Segev, The Seventh Million, chapter 3</ref>

Over all there was little they could do (in the words of [[Tom Segev]]): 
<blockquote>
"The story of the yishuv leaders during the Holocuast was essentially one of helplessness. They rescued a few thousand Jews from Europe. They could, perhaps have saved more, but they could not save millions."<ref> Tom Segev, The Seventh Million, page 72</ref></blockquote>
Efforts were made to offer the Nazis money for the release of Jews however these efforts were systematically (and, according to Segev, cynically) destroyed by the British.<ref>Tom Segev, The Seventh Million, page 94</ref>
 
The 1942 Zionist conference could not be held because of the war. Instead 600 Jewish leaders (not just Zionists) met in a hotel in the Biltmore Hotel in New York and adopted a statement known as the [[Biltmore Program]] [http://www.mideastweb.org/biltmore_program.htm]. They agreed that when the war ended all Jewish organizations would fight to ensure that Jewish migration into Palestine be controlled by the Jewish Agency.

===Impact of the Holocaust===
{{see also|After the Holocaust}}

The Nazi-inspired genocide in Europe had grave consequences for the Zionists.
# A large section of the membership was wiped out, this was particularly damaging in Poland where about a third of the Zionist members had lived, (the Russian membership had been lost to Communism).
# Those Jews who were not killed lost their possessions: the ability of the Zionist movement to raise money in Europe was severely damaged.

This calamity led to important changes in Jewish and Zionist politics:
#Many Jews were now desperate to leave Europe and willing to take grave risks for that purpose
#All Jews now agreed on the need for a Jewish state where Jews could live free of the fear of persecution and which would provide a haven in times of persecution.
#The Jews of the USA were now the dominant force in Jewish politics.
#More Jews were prepared to mobilize on behalf of their brethren.
#Britain was now weakened and less able to resist international pressure.

====The rapid growth of illegal immigration to Palestine====
{{Main|Aliyah Bet}}
{{see also|Berihah|Sh'erit ha-Pletah}}

In 1945, President Truman sent a personal representative, [[Earl G. Harrison]], to investigate the situaiton of the Jewish survivors in Europe. Harrison reported that
<blockquote>
substantial unofficial and unauthorized movements of people must be expected, and these will require considerable force to prevent, for the patience of many of the persons involved is, and in my opinion with justification, nearing the breaking point. It cannot be overemphasized that many of these people are now desperate, that they have become accustomed under German rule to employ every possible means to reach their end, and that the fear of death does not restrain them.<ref>http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/documents/harrison_report.htm accessed Nov 2007</ref>
</blockquote>

Despite winning the 1946 British election with a manifesto promising to create a Jewish state in Palestine, the Labour Government succumbed to Foreign Office pressure and kept Palestine closed to Jewish migration.

In Europe former [[Jewish partisans]] led by [[Abba Kovner]] began to organize escape routes taking Jews from Eastern Europe down to the Mediterranean where the Jewish Agency organized ships to illegally carry them to Palestine.<ref>''Flight and Rescue: Brichah'', written by Yehuda Bauer, published by Random House; New York, 1970 </ref> 
 
The British government responded to this movement by trying to force Jews to return to their places of origin. Holocaust survivors entering the British Zone were denied assistance or forced to live in hostels with former Nazi collaborators.
In American controlled zones, political pressure from Washington allowed Jews to live separately from Christians and meant that the US Army helped Jews trying to move away from the centres of genocide.

==Zionism and Israel since 1948==
{{See also|History of Israel}}
[[Image:Declaration of State of Israel 1948 2.jpg|thumb|[[David Ben Gurion]] (First Prime Minister of [[Israel]]) publicly pronouncing the Declaration of the State of Israel, [[May 14]] [[1948]], [[Tel Aviv]], Israel, beneath a large portrait of [[Theodore Herzl]], founder of modern political Zionism.]]
In 1947 Britain announced its intention to withdraw from Palestine, and on [[29 November]] the [[United Nations General Assembly]] voted to partition Palestine into an Arab state and a Jewish state (with Jerusalem becoming an international enclave). The Jewish Agency accepted the plan,  while the Arabs of Palestine and the neighboring countries rejected it. Civil conflict between the Arabs and Jews in Palestine ensued immediately. On [[14 May]] [[1948]] the leaders of the Jewish community in Palestine made a [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|declaration of independence]], and the state of Israel was established. This marked a major turning point in the Zionist movement, as its principal goal had now been accomplished. Many Zionist institutions were reshaped, and the three military movements combined to form the [[Israel Defence Forces]].

The majority of the Arab population having been ethnically cleansed<ref>N.G. Finkelstein, 'Beyond Chutzpah', 2205, ISBN 0-520-24598-9, p. 3</ref> during the War of Independence, Jews were now a majority of the population within the 1949 ceasefire lines, which became Israel's ''de facto'' borders until 1967. In 1950 the [[Knesset]] passed the [[Law of Return]] which granted all Jews the right to immigrate to Israel. This, together with the influx of Jewish refugees from Europe and the later flood of [[Jewish exodus from Arab lands|Jews from Arab countries]], had the effect of creating a large and apparently permanent Jewish majority in Israel.

Since 1948 the international Zionist movement has undertaken a variety of roles in support of Israel. These have included the encouragement of immigration, assisting the absorption and integration of immigrants, fundraising on behalf of settlement and development projects in Israel, the encouragement of private capital investment in Israel, and mobilization of world public opinion in support of Israel.

The 1967 war between Israel and the Arab states (the "[[Six-Day War]]") marked a major turning point in the history of Israel and of Zionism. Israeli forces captured the eastern half of Jerusalem, including the holiest of Jewish religious sites, the [[Western Wall]] of the ancient Temple. They also took over the remaining territories of pre-1948 Palestine, the [[West Bank]] (from Jordan) and the [[Gaza Strip]] (from [[Egypt]]). Religious Jews regarded the West Bank (ancient [[Judaea]] and [[Samaria]]) as an integral part of Eretz Israel, and within Israel voices of the political Right soon began to argue that these territories should be permanently retained. Zionist groups began to build Jewish settlements in the territories as a means of establishing "facts on the ground" that would make an Israeli withdrawal impossible.

The 28th Zionist Congress (Jerusalem, 1968) adopted the following five principles, known as the "Jerusalem Program", as the aims of contemporary Zionism:<ref>[http://www.wzo.org.il/en/resources/view.asp?id=497&subject=43 The Jerusalem Program] (WZO)</ref>
* The unity of the Jewish people and the centrality of Israel in Jewish life
* The ingathering of the Jewish people in the historic homeland, Eretz Israel, through [[aliyah]] from all countries
* The strengthening of the State of Israel, based on the "prophetic vision of justice and peace"
* The preservation of the identity of the Jewish people through the fostering of Jewish, Hebrew and Zionist education and of Jewish spiritual and cultural values
* The protection of Jewish rights everywhere.

Control of the West Bank and Gaza placed Israel in the position of control over a large population of Palestinian Arabs. Whether or not there had been a distinct Palestinian national identity in the 1920s may be debated, but there is no doubt that by the 1960s such an identity was firmly established &mdash; the founders of Zionism had thus, ironically, created two new nationalities, Israeli and Palestinian, instead of one.

''From this point the history of Israel and the Palestinians can be followed in the article [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]].''

In 1975 the [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379]] was passed. It stated that "zionism is a form of racism and racial discrimination"<ref>The UNGA Res 3379 was passed at the 2400th plenary meeting on [[10 November]] [[1975]]. [http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/000/92/IMG/NR000092.pdf?OpenElement (PDF)].</ref> The resolution 3379 was rescinded in 1991 by the [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 4686|Resolution 4686]].<ref>The UNGA resolution 4686 was passed at the 74th plenary meeting on [[16 December]] [[1991]] by a vote of 111-25-13. The text of the resolution is available [http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/46/a46r086.htm here].</ref> This issue is discussed in length in the article on [[anti-Zionism]].

Since 1948 most Jews have continued to identify as Zionists, in the sense that they support the State of Israel even if they do not choose to live there. This worldwide support has been of vital importance to Israel, both politically and financially. This has been particularly true since 1967, as the rise of [[Palestinian nationalism]] and the resulting political and military struggles have eroded sympathy for Israel among non-Jews, at least outside the [[United States]].

==International reactions to Zionism==

Both the [[League of Nations]]' [[1922]] [[Palestine Mandate]] and the [[1947 UN Partition Plan]] broadly endorsed the aim of Zionism. The latter was a rare instance of concurrence between the United States and the Soviet Union during the [[Cold War]], although [[Harry Truman]]'s State Department, led by [[George Marshall]], vehemently opposed the formation of the state of Israel.<ref> David McCullough, ''Truman'', Simon and Schuster, 1992, pp. 614-620</ref> Only Truman's personal insistence overcame Marshall's intense opposition, which was based on strategic concerns for the stability of the region.<ref> Ibid. </ref> Marshall's opposition was recounted in detail by Truman's aide [[Clark Clifford]], who led the internal campaign to recognize a new Jewish state.<ref> Clark Clifford, with Richard Holbrooke, ''Counsel to the President'', Random House, 1991.</ref>

==Anti-Zionism and post-Zionism==<!-- This section is linked from [[Projects working for peace among Israelis and Arabs]] -->
{{main|Anti-Zionism|Post-Zionism}}
There are a number of critics of Zionism, ranging from Jewish anti-Zionists to pro-Palestinian activists. Some of the most vocal critics of Zionism have tended to be Palestinians and other [[Arabs]],{{Fact|date=August 2007}} many of whom view Israel as wrongfully occupying what they view as the Arab land of [[Palestine]].<ref>El-Nawawy, Mohammed (2002). ''The Israeli-Egyptian Peace Process in the reporting of western Journalists''. Ablex/Greenwood, pg. 19 ISBN 1567505449 "It is a barrier that has been created by years and years of antagonism with Israelis; a barrier that was strengthened by the Egyptian and Arab news media at large which have enforced the Arabs' stereotypes about the Israelis as invaders of Arab land."</ref><ref>Khalidi, Rashid (2006). ''The Iron Cage: The Story of the Palestinian Struggle for Statehood''. Beacon Press, pg. 19. </ref>  Such critics generally opposed Israel's creation in 1948, and continue to criticize the Zionist movement which underlies it.  These critics view the changes in demographic balance which accompanied the creation of Israel, including the displacement of some 700,000 Arab [[palestinian refugee|refugees]],<ref>The U.N.'s final estimate of the total number of Palestinian Refugees was 711,000 according to the ''[http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/9a798adbf322aff38525617b006d88d7/93037e3b939746de8525610200567883!OpenDocument General Progress Report and Supplementary Report of the United Nations Conciliation Commission for Palestine, Covering the Period from [[11 December]] [[1949]] to [[23 October]] [[1950]]]'', published by the [[United Nations Conciliation Commission]], [[October 23]], [[1950]].

Critics of Zionism, such as [[Joseph Massad]] of [[Columbia University]] have asserted that Zionism is a form of [[Zionism and racism|racism]],<ref name = "MassadAlAhram">{{cite web

"Zizek seems observant enough, in another essay, to note that Zionist Jews are employing anti-Semitic notions to describe the Palestinians.

</ref> both in its support of Israel as a Jewish State, and in its continuing policies such as the [[Law of Return]].

While most Jewish groups are pro-Zionist, some liberal and [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] Jewish communities (most vocally the [[Satmar]] Hasidim and the [[Neturei Karta]] group), oppose Zionism on religious grounds.<ref>Neturei Karta, Satmar and various left wing anti-Zionist groups make up a tiny fraction of the Jewish population and do not represent main stream thinking, [http://www.zionismontheweb.org/antizionism/Against_Zionists_not_Jews.htm Again Zionists Not Jews], Anti-Zionist Resource Center, Zionism On The Web.</ref>  Other non-Zionist Israeli movements, such as the [[canaanites (movement)|Canaanite]] movement led by poet [[Yonatan Ratosh]] in the 1930s and 1940s, have argued that "Israeli" should be a new pan-ethnic [[nationality]].  A related modern movement is known as [[post-Zionism]], which asserts that Israel should abandon the concept of a "state of the Jewish people" and instead strive to be a state of all its citizens.[http://www.meforum.org/article/469] Another opinion favors a [[binational solution|binational state]] in which Arabs and Jews live together while enjoying some type of autonomy, as in Belgium.

Critics of anti-Zionism reject the charges that Zionism is racist, insisting it is no different than any other national liberation movement of oppressed peoples, and argue that criticisms of Israel and Zionism are often disproportionate in degree and unique in kind, sometimes attributing this to [[antisemitism]].<ref name=Taguieff>Taguieff, Pierre-André. ''Rising From the Muck: The New Anti-Semitism in Europe''. Ivan R. Dee, 2004. </ref><ref name=Rosenbaum>Rosenbaum, Ron. ''Those who forget the past''. Random House, 2004.</ref>

==Non-Jewish Zionism==
===Christian Zionism===
{{main|Christian Zionism}}
In addition to Jewish Zionism, there was always a small number of [[Christian Zionism|Christian Zionists]] that existed from the early days of the Zionist movement. According to Charles Merkley of Carleton University, Christian Zionism strengthened significantly after the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], and many [[Dispensationalism|dispensationalist]] Christians, especially in the United States, now strongly support Zionism.

Throughout the entire 19th century and early 20th century, the return of the Jews to the Holy Land was widely supported by such eminent figures as [[Queen Victoria]], [[King Edward VII]], [[John Adams]], the second President of the [[United States]], [[Jan Smuts|General Smuts]] of [[South Africa]], [[Tomáš Masaryk|President Masaryk]] of [[Czechoslovakia]], British Prime Ministers Lloyd George and Arthur Balfour, President [[Woodrow Wilson]], [[Benedetto Croce]], [[Italy|Italian]] philosopher and historian, [[Henry Dunant]], founder of the [[Red Cross]] and author of the [[Geneva Conventions]], [[Fridtjof Nansen]], [[Norway|Norwegian]] scientist and humanitarian. The [[France|French]] government through Minister M. Cambon formally committed itself to “the renaissance of the Jewish nationality in that Land from which the people of Israel were exiled so many centuries ago". Even in faraway [[China]], Wang, Minister of Foreign Affairs, declared that "the Nationalist government is in full sympathy with the Jewish people in their desire to establish a country for themselves."<ref> Palestine: The Original Sin , Meir Abelson [http://www.acpr.org.il/ENGLISH-NATIV/issue1/Abelson-1.htm] </ref>

===Muslims supporting Zionism===
Most Muslim public figures oppose Zionism; there is no organized Zionist movement among Muslims. There are, however, a few [[Muslim]] thinkers who publicly express Zionist views. The best known is Sheikh [[Abdul Hadi Palazzi]], the leader of Italian Muslim Assembly and a co-founder of the [[Islam-Israel Fellowship]]. In 2005, Palazzi told FrontPage Magazine ''"I find in the Qur'an that God granted the Land of Israel to the Children of Israel and ordered them to settle therein ({{cite quran|5|21|style=ref}}) and that before the [[Qiyamah|Last Day]] He will bring the Children of Israel to retake possession of their Land, gathering them from different countries and nations ({{cite quran|17|104|style=ref}}). Consequently, as a Muslim who abides by the Qur'an, I believe that opposing the existence of the State of Israel means opposing a Divine decree."''<ref>''The Anti-Terror, Pro-Israel Sheikh'', By Jamie Glazov, September 12, 2005, [http://www.frontpagemagazine.com/Articles/Read.aspx?GUID={AD363EAC-228E-432A-9F15-8702D7765792} FrontPageMagazine.com]</ref>

Other public Muslim figures supporting Zionism include [[Magdi Allam]], [[Salah Choudhury]] and [[Tashbih Sayyed]], who calls himself a 'Muslim Zionist'.<ref>''Tashbih Sayyed ― A Fearless Muslim Zionist'', by Rachel Neuwirth, 24 Jun, 2007, The American Thinker, posted by [http://www.islam-watch.org/Others/Tashbih-Sayyed-A%20Fearless-Muslim-Zionist.htm Islam-Watch.org]</ref>.

===Marcus Garvey and "Black Zionism"===

Zionist success in winning British support for formation of a "Jewish National Home" in Palestine helped inspire the African-American Nationalist [[Marcus Garvey]] to form a movement dedicated to returning Americans of African origin to Africa. During a speech in [[Harlem]] in 1920 Garvey stated that
<blockquote>
other races were engaged in seeing their cause through---the Jews through their Zionist movement and the Irish through their Irish movement---and I decided that, cost what it might, I would make this a favorable time to see the Negro's interest through.<ref>[[Negro World]] 6, March 1920 cited in http://www.international.ucla.edu/africa/mgpp/lifeintr.asp (accessed 29/11/2007).</ref></blockquote>
Garvey established a shipping company, the [[Black Star Line]], to ship Black Americans to Africa, but for various reasons failed in his endeavour. His ideas helped inspire the [[Rastafarian]] movement in Jamaica, the [[Black Jews]] <ref> http://www.blackjews.org/RabbiBios/RabbiFord.html</ref> and the [[The African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem|Black Hebrews]] who initially moved to Liberia before settling in Israel.
