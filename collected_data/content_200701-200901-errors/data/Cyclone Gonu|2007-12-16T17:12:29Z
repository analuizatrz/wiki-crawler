'''Cyclone Gonu''' (JTWC designation: '''''02A''''', also known as '''Super Cyclonic Storm Gonu''') was the strongest [[tropical cyclone]] on record in the [[Arabian Sea]], and tied for the strongest tropical cyclone on record in the northern [[Indian Ocean]].<ref name="jtwcbt">{{Cite web|author=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|year=2007|title=Northern Indian Ocean Tropical Cyclone Best Track Data|accessdate=2007-06-04|url=https://metocph.nmci.navy.mil/jtwc/best_tracks/ioindex.html}}</ref> The second named tropical cyclone of the [[2007 North Indian Ocean cyclone season]], Gonu developed from a persistent area of convection in the eastern [[Arabian Sea]] on [[June 1]]. With a favorable upper-level environment and warm [[sea surface temperature]]s, it [[rapid deepening|rapidly intensified]] to attain peak winds of 240&nbsp;km/h (150&nbsp;mph) on [[June 3]] according to the [[India Meteorological Department]]. Gonu weakened after encountering dry air and cooler waters, and late on [[June 5]] it made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] on the eastern-most tip of [[Oman]], becoming the strongest tropical cyclone to hit the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. Intense cyclones like Gonu have been extremely rare over the Arabian Sea, as most storms in this area tend to be small and dissipate quickly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/natural_hazards_v2.php3?img_id=14288|title=NASA Earth Observatory: Tropical Cyclone Gonu|date=2007-06-04|accessdate=2007-06-05|work=NASA}}</ref>

The cyclone caused about $4&nbsp;billion in damage (2007&nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD]]) and over 50 deaths in [[Oman]], where the cyclone was considered the nation's worst natural disaster. Gonu dropped heavy rainfall near the eastern coastline, reaching up to 610&nbsp;mm (24&nbsp;inches) which caused flooding and heavy damage. In [[Iran]], the cyclone caused 23 deaths and $215&nbsp;million in damage (2007&nbsp;USD).

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Gonu 2007 track.png}}
On [[May 27]], a widespread area of [[convection]] persisted over the southeastern [[Arabian Sea]].<ref>{{cite web|author=India Meteorological Department|year=2007|title=May 27 Tropical Weather Outlook|accessdate=2007-06-04|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/New-Delhi/2007052706.DEMS}}</ref> By [[May 31]], an organized tropical disturbance developed about 645&nbsp;km (400&nbsp;mi) south of [[Mumbai]], [[India]] with cyclonic convection and a well-defined mid-level circulation. The disturbance initially lacked a distinct low-level circulation; instead it consisted of strong [[divergence (meteorology)|divergence]] along the western end of a surface [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] of low pressure.<ref>{{cite web|author=Delta Forecast Team|year=2007|title=May 31 Significant Tropical Weather Advisory for the North Indian Ocean|publisher=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|accessdate=2007-06-04|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5PKajUuuL}}</ref> 

A propitious upper-level environment allowed convection to improve, and on [[June 1]] a low-level circulation formed.<ref>{{cite web|author=Charlie Forecast Team|year=2007|title=June 1 Significant Tropical Weather Advisory for the North Indian Ocean|publisher=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|accessdate=2007-06-04|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5PKajUuuL}}</ref> By late on [[June 1]], the system developed to the extent that the [[India Meteorological Department]] (IMD) classified it a depression.<ref>{{cite web|author=India Meteorological Department|year=2007|title=June 2 Tropical Weather Outlook|accessdate=2007-06-04|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/New-Delhi/2007060201.DEMS}}</ref> It tracked westward along the southwestern periphery of a mid-level [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] over southern [[India]]; convection continued to organize, and early on [[June 2]] the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) classified it Tropical Cyclone 02A while it was located about 685&nbsp;km (425&nbsp;mi) southwest of Mumbai, India.<ref name="warn1">{{cite web|author=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|year=2007|title=Tropical Cyclone 02A Warning NR 001|accessdate=2007-06-04|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/GuamStuff/2007060203-WTIO.PGTW}}</ref>

Upon first forming, the system contended with the entrainment of dry [[air]] to the northwest of the storm; this was expected to limit intensification.<ref name="warn1"/> The storm steadily intensified; early on [[June 2]] the IMD upgraded it to deep depression status,<ref>{{cite web|author=India Meteorological Department|year=2007|title=Deep Depression over East Central Arabian Sea|accessdate=2007-06-04|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5PI3E1mSw}}</ref> and later in the day the IMD classified the system as Cyclonic Storm Gonu while it was located 760&nbsp;km (470&nbsp;mi) southwest of Mumbai, India.<ref>{{cite web|author=India Meteorological Department|year=2007|title=Cyclone Storm “GONU’ over East Central Arabian Sea|accessdate=2007-06-04|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5PIRtXOfN}}</ref> The name ''Gonu'' was contributed by the [[Maldives]], meaning 'bag made from palm leaves' in [[Dhivehi language|Dhivehi]], the Maldivian language.<ref name="FOXNews">{{cite web|author=Associated Press|year=2007|title=Powerful Cyclone Gonu Strikes Oil-Rich Persian Gulf|publisher=FOXNews.com|accessdate=2007-06-04|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,278098,00.html}}</ref> As a mid-latitude trough developed over [[Pakistan]], Gonu turned to the north and northeast,<ref name="warn4">{{cite web|author=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|year=2007|title=Tropical Cyclone Gonu Warning NR 004|accessdate=2007-06-04|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5PJM7tPiw}}</ref> though resumed a westward track after ridging built to the north of the storm.<ref name="warn5">{{cite web|author=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|year=2007|title=Tropical Cyclone Gonu Warning NR 005|accessdate=2007-06-04|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5PJgtZuxr}}</ref> 

With a solid area of intense convection, it [[rapid deepening|rapidly intensified]] to attain severe cyclonic status early on [[June 3]],<ref>{{cite web|author=India Meteorological Department|year=2007|title=Severe Cyclone Storm “GONU’ over East Central Arabian Sea|accessdate=2007-06-04|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5PJM7lt7l}}</ref> and with good [[outflow (meteorology)|outflow]] the JTWC upgraded it to the equivalent of a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 1]] tropical cyclone.<ref name="warn6">{{cite web|author=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|year=2007|title=Tropical Cyclone Gonu Warning NR 006|accessdate=2007-06-04|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5PK57ccI9}}</ref> The dry air ultimately had a smaller impact on the intensification than previously estimated. As the storm tracked under an upper-level ridge axis, outflow increased further, and combined with a local increase in ocean heat content, Gonu rapidly deepened and developed a well-defined [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] in the center of [[convection]].<ref name="warn7">{{cite web|author=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|year=2007|title=Tropical Cyclone Gonu Warning NR 007|accessdate=2007-06-04|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5PKZ3UgwO}}</ref>

==Aftermath==
The [[Seeb International Airport]] in [[Muscat, Oman]] reopened after three days of closure. The port of [[Fujairah]] in the [[United Arab Emirates]] reopened on [[June 7]] after it was closed the day before.<ref name="Reuters-DialaSaadeh"/> The cyclone caused little impact to oil facilities along its path, and as a result oil prices dropped over US$2 per barrel.<ref>{{cite web|author=Associated Press|year=2007|title=Oil prices decline by US$2 a barrel after Cyclone Gonu dissipates, easing supply worries|accessdate=2007-06-08|url=http://www.940news.com/nouvelles.php?cat=22&id=60886}}</ref> In [[Oman]], production of [[desalination|desalinated water]] was interrupted, as both of Oman's desalination plants failed. The first, Ghubrah, lost supplies of [[natural gas]], halting production; while the second, Barka, sustained a damaged switchgear due to flooding. These plants provided water to Muscat's 631,000 residents and surrounding areas, triggering severe water shortages across eastern Oman. To rectify the situation, officials emptied [[water tank]]s. The water returned to near normal in five days, as the two plants returned to service. Additionally, electricians worked quickly to repair [[power outage]]s.<ref name="ap610"/> Five days after Gonu hit, [[utilities]] were restored to most of Muscat and the coastal provinces. The Omani army assisted residents in returning to their houses. Even though the Omani government did not request any international aid, the [[United States]] offered assistance through [[United States Navy|naval ships]] in the area. This was eventually rejected.<ref name="dn611"/> The country lost an estimated $200&nbsp;million (2007 USD) in oil exports.<ref>{{cite web|author=Reuters|year=2007|title=Gonu costs Oman $200m in lost exports|accessdate=2007-06-11|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=14224}}</ref>

After the passage of the cyclone, the [[Red Crescent Society of the Islamic Republic of Iran|Iran chapter]] of the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] and its volunteers worked in conjunction with the military to distribute relief supplies to isolated villages using trucks and helicopters. The branch in [[Sistan and Baluchestan Province]] distributed over 10,000 blankets, 1,300 tents, 400 clothing items, 82,000 loaves of bread, and 87,000 bottles of water to affected citizens.<ref name="irfc611">{{cite web|author=International Federation of Red Cross And Red Crescent Societies|year=2007|title=Iran: Cyclone Gonu Information Bulletin No. 2|publisher=Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs|accessdate=2007-06-11|url=http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/EGUA-743KL3?OpenDocument&rc=3&emid=TC-2007-000075-OMN}}</ref>
