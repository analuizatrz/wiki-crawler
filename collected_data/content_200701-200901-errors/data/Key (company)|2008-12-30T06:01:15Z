'''Key''' is a Japanese [[visual novel]] studio under [[Visual Art's]], known for making dramatic and [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]-oriented visual novels. ''[[Kanon]]'' was Key's debut release, which combined an elaborate [[Plot (narrative)|storyline]], an up-to-date [[anime]]-style drawing style, and a musical score which helped to set the mood for the game. Key's second game, ''[[Air (visual novel)|Air]]'' had a similar if not more complex storyline to ''Kanon'' and a more thorough gameplay. Both ''Kanon'' and ''Air'' were originally produced as [[Eroge|adult games]], but had non-erotic console ports released for the [[Dreamcast]], [[PlayStation 2]], and [[PlayStation Portable]]. As of July 2007, Key has released six games, and has worked in the past with [[Interchannel]], and [[Prototype (company)|Prototype]] for the consumer port releases of previous Key titles. Key has announced their seventh game, ''[[Rewrite (visual novel)|Rewrite]]''.<ref name="rewrite"/>

Every soundtrack that is released based from one of Key's titles is on a [[record label]] called [[Key Sounds Label]]. There are other albums on the label not directly related to the visual novels, such as two albums by [[Lia (singer)|Lia]] and one by [[Eufonius]]. The albums on this label have music composed by members from Key, such as [[Jun Maeda]], and [[Shinji Orito]]. Three of Key's works, ''Kanon'', ''Air'' and ''Clannad'', have been made into [[anime]]. Key supervised the production of these anime while working with two animation studios, [[Toei Animation]], and [[Kyoto Animation]]. Toei Animation animated the first ''Kanon'' TV anime series, the [[Air (film)|''Air'' movie]] and the [[Clannad (film)|''Clannad'' movie]]. Kyoto Animation animated the ''Air'' TV anime series, the second ''Kanon'' TV anime series, and the two ''Clannad'' TV anime series.

==History==
Before forming Key, the founding members worked for another visual novel development company called [[Tactics (company)|Tactics]]. At the time of ''[[Dōsei]]'''s production, Tactics' first game, four of Key's original staff worked on the game: [[Itaru Hinoue]] as art director, [[Shinji Orito]] as musical composer, and Miracle Mikipon and Shinory contributing to the computer graphics. After ''Dōsei'', the rest of Key's founding staff joined Tactics and contributed to two more games: ''[[Moon.]]'', and ''[[One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e]]''. After the release of ''One'' on May 26, 1998, these developers transferred to [[Visual Art's]] where they formed Key; the name Key for the studio was decided by [[majority rule]].<ref>{{citeweb|last=Tonokawa|first=Yūto|url= http://key.visualarts.gr.jp/diary/2008/07/post_27.html|title=Answering Questions Journal|date=2008-07-07|accessdate=2008-07-08| language=Japanese|quote=At the time, the staff decided on majority rule. (当時のスタッフの多数決で決まったようです。)}}</ref> Key released their debut title ''[[Kanon]]'' on June 4, 1999, an [[Eroge|adult game]],<ref>{{citeweb|url= http://key.visualarts.gr.jp/product/kanon/| title=Kanon's visual novel official website|publisher=Key|accessdate=2007-11-30|language= Japanese}}</ref> though the scenes containing sexual intercourse were kept to a minimum. This gave the player more of a focus on the characters' stories and on the visuals and music, especially for a visual novel at the time of its release. A year later, on September 8, 2000, Key released their second game ''[[Air (visual novel)|Air]]'', which was also an adult game and similar in storytelling to ''Kanon''.<ref>{{citeweb|url= http://key.visualarts.gr.jp/product/air/|title=Air's visual novel official website|publisher=Key|accessdate=2007-11-30|language= Japanese}}</ref>

The third game named ''[[Clannad (visual novel)|Clannad]]'' is a [[visual novel]] similar to Key's previous games, but is entirely clean, without any [[Hentai|adult]] content. ''Clannad'' was meant to be released in 2002, but was delayed, leading to the game finally being released on April 28, 2004.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://key.visualarts.gr.jp/product/clannad/|title=Clannad's visual novel official website|publisher=Key|accessdate=2007-11-30|language=Japanese}}</ref> Seven months after ''Clannad'''s release, Key released their shortest game, ''[[Planetarian: Chiisana Hoshi no Yume]]'', on November 29, 2004.<ref>{{citeweb|url= http://key.visualarts.gr.jp/product/planetarian/|title=Planetarian's visual novel official website|publisher=Key|accessdate= 2007-11-30|language=Japanese}}</ref> ''Planetarian'', in contrast to Key's past games, is a linear visual novel that does not require the user to make a choice, but to sit back and enjoy the story; this is what is referred to as a [[KineticNovel|kinetic novel]]. The company's fifth game was ''[[Tomoyo After: It's a Wonderful Life]]'', an adult game and sequel of sorts to ''Clannad'' released on November 25, 2005 which expanded on the scenario of the heroine [[List of Clannad characters#Tomoyo Sakagami|Tomoyo Sakagami]] from ''Clannad''.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://key.visualarts.gr.jp/product/tomoyo/| title=Tomoyo After's visual novel official website|publisher=Key|accessdate= 2007-11-30|language=Japanese}}</ref> Key released their sixth game, ''[[Little Busters!]]'', on July 27, 2007 with no adult content,<ref name="littlebusters!">{{citeweb|url= http://key.visualarts.gr.jp/product/little/products.htm|title=Little Busters! products page|accessdate=2007-11-30|language=Japanese}}</ref> but released another version of the game entitled ''Little Busters!

===Key Sounds Label===
{{main|Key Sounds Label}}
In 2001, Visual Art's created the [[record label]] Key Sounds Label (KSL).<ref name="ksldisc">{{citeweb|url=http://key.soundslabel.com/discography.htm|title=Key Sounds Label discography|accessdate=2007-05-03|language=Japanese}}</ref> The music albums and singles released by Key after this were put under this label, meaning that this does not include the first two albums and one single which were released before it was officially formed. The first album on this label was ''[[Humanity...]]'', though the only direct connection to Key's works is that it contains a remixed version of the opening theme to ''Air''. The albums under this label are composed by Key's signature [[composer]]s: Jun Maeda, [[Shinji Orito]] and [[Magome Togoshi]]. Three of the singles feature songs sung by [[Lia (singer)|Lia]] and one album, ''[[Love Song (album)|Love Song]]'', features the singer [[Riya]] from [[Eufonius]]. Three [[Radio drama in Japan|drama CDs]] have been released as well.<ref name="ksldisc"/>

To celebrate Key's ten-year anniversary, Key hosted a [[concert]] called KSL Live World 2008: Way to the Little Busters! EX on May 10, 2008 in Tokyo, Japan, and again on May 17, 2008 in [[Osaka]], Japan. Each time, the concert lasted for two and a half hours and featured songs sung by [[Lia (singer)|Lia]], [[Rita (singer)|Rita]], [[Chata]], and [[Tomoe Tamiyasu]] who have previously sung songs for singles and albums released under Key Sounds Label.<ref>{{citeweb|url= http://key.visualarts.gr.jp/info/2008/03/post_6.html|title=Presenting Information on an Event - KSL Concert|publisher=Key|date=2008-03-14|accessdate=2008-03-14|language= Japanese}}</ref>

===Comiket involvement===
[[Image:Key's booth at Comiket 71.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Key's booth at [[Comiket|Comiket 71]] (December 2006).]]
[[Comiket]], short for Comic Market, is a large comic convention held twice a year in Tokyo, Japan during August and December, which are referred to as the summer and winter Comic Markets respectively. Key has been an active participant in the convention since Comiket 57 in December 1999, where they sold ''[[Kanon]]''-related products (as ''Kanon'' was their only release at the time); one such product was a [[Zippo]] lighter.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://img300.imageshack.us/img300/5396/kanonc57lighterfz0.jpg|title=Image of a Kanon Zippo lighter sold originally at Comiket 57|accessdate=2008-09-20}}</ref> The first ''[[Air (visual novel)|Air]]''-related products Key sold at the convention were at Comiket 59 in December 2000.<ref name="c59">{{citeweb|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20021013195151/http://catalog-of-59.product.co.jp/visualarts.htm|url=http://catalog-of-59.product.co.jp/visualarts.htm|title=Key's Comiket 59 products|publisher=[[Visual Art's]]|archivedate=2002-10-13|accessdate= 2007-11-29|language=Japanese}}</ref> Typical products include: [[postcard]]s, [[telephone card]]s, [[calendar]]s, posters, and [[album]]s.<ref name="c59"/><ref name="c63"/><ref name="c71"/><ref name="c73">{{citeweb|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080208181134/http://c73.product.co.jp/brand/key.html|url=http://c73.product.co.jp/brand/key.html|title=Key's Comiket 73 products|publisher=[[Visual Art's]]|archivedate=2008-02-08|accessdate=2008-09-20|language=Japanese}}</ref> The products Key sells at Comiket are all related to the visual novels the company produces.<ref name="c59"/><ref name="c63"/><ref name="c71"/><ref name="c73"/>

Key, through Visual Art's, generally participates at the winter Comiket in conjunction with other brands under Visual Art's, but has been known to appear at the summer Comiket too, such as with Comiket 70 in August 2006 where they sold ''[[Planetarian: Chiisana Hoshi no Yume]]'' related products.<ref>{{citeweb|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070706211910/http://key.visualarts.gr.jp/c70/c70-goods.html|url=http://key.visualarts.gr.jp/c70/c70-goods.html|title=Key's Comiket 70 products|publisher=Key|archivedate= 2007-07-06|accessdate=2008-09-20|language=Japanese}}</ref> The combined total of the products Key sells at a given Comiket range in price between 3,000 [[Japanese yen|yen]] (about [[United States dollar|US$]]27) and 5,000 yen (about US$45).<ref name="c63">{{citeweb|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030415211013/http://catalog-of-63.product.co.jp/key.html|url=http://catalog-of-63.product.co.jp/key.html|title=Key's Comiket 63 products|publisher=[[Visual Art's]]|archivedate=2003-04-15|accessdate= 2008-09-20|language=Japanese}}</ref><ref name="c71">{{citeweb|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071217101133/http://c71.product.co.jp/brand/key.html|url=http://c71.product.co.jp/brand/key.html|title=Key's Comiket 71 products|publisher=[[Visual Art's]]|archivedate=2007-12-17|accessdate=2008-09-20|language= Japanese}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20031202203616/http://catalog-of-65.product.co.jp/|url=http://catalog-of-65.product.co.jp/|title=Brands under Visual Art's that participated at Comiket 65|publisher=[[Visual Art's]]|archivedate=2003-12-02|accessdate=2008-09-20|language=Japanese}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061007075531/http://c67.product.co.jp/|url=http://c67.product.co.jp/|title=Brands under Visual Art's that participated at Comiket 67|publisher=[[Visual Art's]]|archivedate=2006-10-07|accessdate= 2007-11-29|language=Japanese}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061005014437/http://c69.product.co.jp/|url=http://c69.product.co.jp/|title=Brands under Visual Art's that participated at Comiket 69|publisher=[[Visual Art's]]|archivedate=2006-10-05|accessdate=2008-09-20|language=Japanese}}</ref> This includes the selling of music albums released under Key's [[record label]] [[Key Sounds Label]] which has been releasing albums since Comiket 60 in August 2001 with the release of the label's first two albums, ''[[Humanity...]]'' and "[[List of Air soundtracks#Natsukage / Nostalgia|Natsukage / Nostalgia]]". If there are any unsold products by the end of a given Comiket, Visual Art's has been known to set up an online [[mail order]] to sell the remaining goods from all the brands under Visual Art's that participated at Comiket. After Comiket 73 in December 2007, Visual Art's started taking mail orders on March 4, 2008, and only six days later on March 10, 2008, Key reported that all of Key's goods sold at Comiket 73 were now sold out.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://key.visualarts.gr.jp/info/2008/03/73_1.html| title=Comiket 73 Goods Via Mail Order Has Begun|publisher=Key|date=2008-03-04|accessdate=2008-03-10|language=Japanese}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url=http://key.visualarts.gr.jp/info/2008/03/73_2.html|title=Comiket 73 Goods Sold Out!|publisher=Key|date=2008-03-10|accessdate=2008-03-10| language=Japanese}}</ref> At the end of the second day of Comiket 75 in December 2008, all of Key's goods at the convention were sold out.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://key.visualarts.gr.jp/diary/2008/12/post_49.html|title=Comiket 75 Second Day Journal|publisher= Key|date=2008-12-29|accessdate=2008-12-29|language=Japanese}}</ref>

===Key Radio===
{{main|Key Radio}}
Key began to produce an [[Internet radio]] show simply called {{Nihongo|''Key Radio''|Keyらじ|Key Raji}} in regards to the company with the first recording released on December 13, 2007.<ref name="rec-1">{{citeweb|url= http://key.visualarts.gr.jp/diary/2007/12/key.html|title=Key's official blog entry on the radio's first recording|publisher=Key| date=2007-12-13|accessdate=2007-12-13|language=Japanese}}</ref> It is hosted by [[Shinji Orito]] and [[Itaru Hinoue]] of Key, and another woman named Chiro who works for Pekoe, another visual novel studio under [[Visual Art's]].<ref name="key-radio">{{citeweb|url= http://key.visualarts.gr.jp/gallery/radio/index.html|title=Key Radio section at Key's official website|publisher=Key|accessdate= 2007-12-06|language=Japanese}}</ref> Listeners can submit thoughts about the show and any requests they may have for the show, along with submitting questions to the host trio.<ref>{{citeweb|url= http://key.visualarts.gr.jp/gallery/radio/radio_form.html|title=Key Radio's submission form|publisher=Key| accessdate=2007-12-06|language=Japanese}}</ref> The broadcasts are available via download on Key's official website and were available for download on the radio show's official blog for the first nine broadcasts.<ref name="key-radio"/><ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.voiceblog.jp/visualarts/|title=Key Radio's official blog|accessdate=2007-12-28| language=Japanese}}</ref> The broadcasts can also be listened to on Visual Art's' [[YouTube]] channel named Visual Channel.<ref> {{citeweb|url=http://jp.youtube.com/user/visualarts|title=Visual Channel official website|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate= 2008-07-11|language=Japanese}}</ref>

For the first six episodes, the show had five corners, or parts, which started with opening greetings from the hosts and went onto thoughts and impressions that listeners had about the show. This moved on to an informal talk between the hosts, followed by a section where entries previously submitted by listeners concerning their enthusiasm for Key were read by the hosts. The fourth corner concerned answering questions that had been submitted by listeners, and the final corner had Orito playing the flute; listeners could submit suggestions for songs he was to play.<ref name="key-radio"/> Two more corners were added starting with the seventh broadcast. The first corner added concerns scary stories that the hosts can tell themselves, or read from submissions by listeners, and was added party because Hinoue enjoys such stories. The second corner added deals with submissions by listeners describing a new fictional character, and Hinoue will take these submissions and form a new fictional character out of combining elements from multiple submissions together. During the broadcasts, tracks from the soundtracks released under [[Key Sounds Label]] play in the background.

==Staff==
===Main===
The main staff in Key are members that have had a hand in nearly every game released by Key and do the majority of the work involved. [[Jun Maeda]] has worked on the planning for the individual projects and was one of the main scenario writers; he has also composed music for all of Key's games except ''Planetarian''.<ref>'''Untranslated quote:''' 自分の書いた曲では一番気に入ってます。<br>'''Translated quote:''' "Out of the songs I wrote myself, I like this one ["Zankō"] the most."<br>''Kanon Original Soundtrack'' booklet, page 4.</ref><ref name="Kanon-OST-Chudahs">{{citeweb|url= http://www.chudahs-corner.com/soundtracks/index.php?catalog=KSLA-0006|title=Chudah's Corner on the ''Kanon Original Soundtrack''| accessdate=2007-11-13}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url=http://erogamescape.dyndns.org/~ap2/ero/toukei_kaiseki/creater.php?creater=938| title=Jun Maeda's visual novel contributions| accessdate=2007-11-16|language=Japanese}}</ref> Maeda was reported to say in the February 2007 issue of ''[[Comptiq]]'' that after the completion of ''Little Busters!'', he would not be working on the scenario staff for Key any longer.<ref>{{citeweb|url= http://ranking.getchu.com/pc/2007_g_ranking/2007_g_ranking_all.html|title=Getchu.com's yearly Bishōjo Game Ranking poll results for best overall game titles from 2007|accessdate=2008-03-15|language=Japanese}}</ref> However, in an interview in the December 2007 issue of ''[[Dengeki G's Magazine]]'', Maeda said that he would still be working on the music for Key's next game.<ref>{{citation|title=Jun Maeda and Shinji Orito Interview|magazine=[[Dengeki G's Magazine]]|issue=December 2007|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]}}</ref> [[Itaru Hinoue]] is Key's main artist and was the art director for Key's first three games.<ref>{{citeweb|url= http://erogamescape.dyndns.org/~ap2/ero/toukei_kaiseki/creater.php?creater=621|title= Itaru Hinoue's visual novel contributions |accessdate=2007-11-30|language=Japanese}}</ref> [[Na-Ga]], another prominent artist in the company, mainly worked with background art in earlier games, but with ''Little Busters!'' was given the position of co-art director with Hinoue.<ref name="littlebusters!"/> Further computer graphics have been provided in the past by three graphic artists: Shinory, Mochisuke, Minimo Tayama, and Torino.<ref name="airfun">{{citeweb|url= http://airfun.fc2web.com/staff.html|title=Key-Tactics staff information|accessdate=2008-09-18|language=Japanese}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url=http://key.visualarts.gr.jp/gallery/uro02.html|title=Sketches of art by Key staff, with staff position listed|publisher=Key|accessdate=2007-12-01|language=Japanese}}</ref> Key's main [[composer]], [[Shinji Orito]], has been with the company since ''Kanon''.<ref name="Kanon-OST-Chudahs"/><ref>'''Untranslated quote:''' サウンド担当　折戸伸治<br>'''Translated quote:''' "Sound Director Shinji Orito."<br>''Kanon Original Soundtrack'' booklet, page 5.</ref> With Maeda no longer contributing to the scenario, another scenario writer, [[Yūto Tonokawa]], joined Key and first worked on the scenario in ''Little Busters!'', but has also worked on the scenario for ''[[Rewrite (visual novel)|Rewrite]]''.<ref name="rewrite">{{citeweb|url=http://key.visualarts.gr.jp/rewrite/rewrite.html|title=''Rewrite'' visual novel official website|publisher=Key|accessdate=2008-03-31|language=Japanese}}</ref>

In addition to the main staff, there are others who have helped make the games released by Key. Kazuki Fujii helped write the scenario for ''Air'', working as a scenario assistant.<ref name="airfun"/> [[Eeji Komatsu]] worked as the art director for the [[KineticNovel|kinetic novel]] ''Planetarian'',<ref name="planetarian">{{citeweb|url=http://key.visualarts.gr.jp/product/planetarian/ |title=Key's official Planetarian website|accessdate=2007-05-27|language=Japanese}}</ref> and another artist, [[Fumio]], worked as the art director for ''Tomoyo After''.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://erogamescape.ddo.jp/~ap2/ero/toukei_kaiseki/game.php?game=5986|title=Tomoyo After staff information|accessdate=2007-05-27|language=Japanese}}</ref> Further scenario writers include [[Leo Kashida]], an outsourced writer who worked with Key on ''Tomoyo After'' and ''Little Busters!'', and Chika Shirokiri, another outsourced writer who worked with Key on ''Little Busters!''.<ref name="littlebusters!"/><ref name="erogamescape">{{citeweb|url= http://erogamescape.ddo.jp/~ap2/ero/toukei_kaiseki/creater.php?creater=3064|title=Leo Kashida's visual novel contributions|accessdate= 2007-11-30|language=Japanese}}</ref> Two new composers named Manack and PMMK helped with the music in ''Little Busters!'', and MintJam helped with arrangement.<ref name="littlebusters!"/> Two out-sourced writers worked on the scenario for ''Rewrite'': [[Ryukishi07]] of [[07th Expansion]], and [[Romeo Tanaka]].<ref name="rewrite"/>

===Former===
Many of Key's staff have left the company over time. [[Naoki Hisaya]] had worked as one of the main scenario writers for ''Kanon'',<ref name="airfun"/> but once the project was complete, he left the company; Hisaya later provided the original concept for ''[[Sola (manga)|Sola]]''. Another member of the staff that made ''Kanon'' was [[OdiakeS]], a composer who has since left Key. OdiakeS returned to help in two music albums, one each released for ''Air'' and ''Clannad'', but has done nothing with Key since 2004.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.beta.or.jp/~odiakes/|title=OdiakeS' personal website|accessdate=2007-05-27|language=Japanese}}</ref> One of the staff members for ''Air'', Takashi Ishikawa, only participated in this game as one of the scenario writers, but did not contribute in future games released by Key.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://erogamescape.ddo.jp/~ap2/ero/toukei_kaiseki/creater.php?creater=941|title=Takashi Ishikawa's involvement in Key|accessdate=2007-05-27|language=Japanese}}</ref> Ishikawa has since moved to another brand in [[Visual Art's]] as of 2000. Kai, one of the scenario writers, contributed in ''Air'' and ''Clannad'', as did a different scenario writer named Tōya Okano. Kai moved to the company [[Ram (company)|Ram]] under Visual Art's in 2004 and Okano moved to the company Giant Panda, also under Visual Art's, the same year. Another scenario writer, [[Yūichi Suzumoto]], worked with Key between ''Air'' and ''Planetarian''. Suzumoto has since transferred to [[Leaf (company)|Leaf]] as of 2004 under the publisher Aquaplus. One of the original computer graphics artists, Miracle Mikipon, left after ''Clannad''. Mikipon had been working for [[Psycho (company)|Psycho]] under [[Nexton]] starting in 2004, but then moved onto the company Ham Ham Soft under Visual Art's.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.psycho-cop.net/ff.htm|title=Miracle Mikipon employed by Psycho|accessdate=2007-06-13|language=Japanese}}</ref> [[Magome Togoshi]] had been with Key since ''Air'', working as one of the signature composers, but left the company in October 2006.<ref>{{citeweb|url= http://magome.cocolog-nifty.com/blog/2007/07/key_8ca9.html|title=Magome Togoshi's official blog announcement of his resignation from Key|date=2007-07-10|accessdate= 2007-11-29|language=Japanese}}</ref>

==Impact==
[[Image:Promo yumemi.jpg|thumb|A promo character card of Yumemi Hoshino from ''[[Planetarian: Chiisana Hoshi no Yume]]'' from the ''[[Lycèe Trading Card Game]]''.]]
According to Satoshi Todome's work, ''A History of Adult Games'', Key's impact on the visual novel, or rather primarily the [[Eroge|adult game]], world stems from before Key was formed and most of the founding members of Key worked for [[Tactics (company)|Tactics]] under [[Nexton]].<ref name="history-of-adult-games">{{citeweb|last=Todome|first=Satoshi|url=http://www.kyo-kan.net/column/eroge/eroge3.html|title=A History of Adult Games, chapter 3|accessdate=2007-11-22|language=Japanese}}</ref> Due to an influence by [[Leaf (company)|Leaf's]] visual novel ''[[To Heart]]'' released in 1997, the developers at Tactics created a simple formula for a game: a comedic first half with a heart-warming romantic middle followed by a tragic separation and finally an emotional reunion formed what is known as a "crying game". The main purpose of such a game is to make the player feel for the characters and make them cry due to emotional scenarios which serves to leave a bigger impact on the player after the game is over.<ref name="history-of-adult-games"/> Tactics' second title ''[[One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e]]'' was created based on this formula.

After ''One'' was complete, the development team quit Tactics to form Key where they developed their first title ''[[Kanon]]'' also based upon on this formula.<ref name="history-of-adult-games"/> ''Kanon'' was "heavily hyped [and] had gamers impatient until its release. It was only one game released by Key so far, and yet [it] had already sent major shockwaves around the industry. And yet another game [''Air''], two years later, sent even more shockwaves. ''Air'' was equally hyped and well received."<ref name="bluemist">{{citeweb|url=http://bluemist.animeblogger.net/archives/key/|title=Short Key history|accessdate=2007-05-03}}</ref> The success of ''One'' and ''Kanon'' on Key's formula to create a "crying game" was later adopted by other visual novel developing companies which were influenced by this formula. Examples of this include: ''[[Kana: Little Sister]]'' by Digital Object, the ''[[Memories Off]]'' series by [[KID]], ''[[D.C.: Da Capo]]'' by [[Circus (company)|Circus]], ''[[Snow (visual novel)|Snow]]'' by Studio Mebius (also under [[Visual Art's]]), and ''[[Wind: A Breath of Heart]]'' by [[Minori]].<ref name="history-of-adult-games"/>

Key is one of seventeen brands under [[Visual Art's]] with games included in the ''[[Lycèe Trading Card Game]]'' published by [[Broccoli (company)|Broccoli]]. Characters from Key's first five games were included in the first three out of four Visual Art's card sets,<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.lycee-tcg.com/card_list_serch.cgi?version=VA1.1|title=Lycèe Trading Card Game Visual Art's 1.1 card set|publisher=[[Broccoli (company)|Broccoli]]|accessdate=2007-11-30|language=Japanese}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.lycee-tcg.com/card_list_serch.cgi?version=VA2.0|title=Lycèe Trading Card Game Visual Art's 2.0 card set|publisher=[[Broccoli (company)|Broccoli]]|accessdate=2007-11-30|language=Japanese}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url= http://www.lycee-tcg.com/card_list_serch.cgi?version=VA3.0|title=Lycèe Trading Card Game Visual Art's 3.0 card set|publisher=[[Broccoli (company)|Broccoli]]|accessdate=2007-11-30|language=Japanese}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url= http://www.lycee-tcg.com/card_list_serch.cgi?version=VA4.0|title=Lycèe Trading Card Game Visual Art's 3.0 card set|publisher=[[Broccoli (company)|Broccoli]]|accessdate=2007-11-30|language=Japanese}}</ref> and characters from ''Little Busters!'' were featured in the fifth Visual Art's card set.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.lycee-tcg.com/release_2008spring_va500.html|title= Lycèe Trading Card Game Visual Art's 5.0 card set|publisher=[[Broccoli (company)|Broccoli]]|accessdate=2008-04-01|language=Japanese}} </ref> There are also seven out of fifty-five rare promotional cards with characters from Key titles.<ref>{{citeweb|url= http://www.lycee-tcg.com/card_list_serch.cgi?version=all&rare=P|title=Lycèe Trading Card Game promotional cards|publisher=[[Broccoli (company)|Broccoli]]|accessdate=2007-11-30|language=Japanese}}</ref> Other big-name visual novel companies included in the card game include: [[AliceSoft]], [[August (company)|August]], [[Leaf (company)|Leaf]], [[Navel (company)|Navel]], and [[Type-Moon]].<ref> {{citeweb|url=http://www.lycee-tcg.com/card.html| title=Lycèe Trading Card Game card sets|publisher=[[Broccoli (company)|Broccoli]]|accessdate=2007-11-30|language=Japanese}}</ref>

===Leaf, Key BBS===
A [[bulletin board system]] (BBS) based on the interface of the large Japanese [[Internet forum]] [[2channel]] (2ch) was formed on January 26, 2000 named {{Nihongo|"Leaf, Key BBS"|leaf,key掲示板|leaf,key Keijiban}}, otherwise nicknamed as {{Nihongo|"Leaf-Key Board"|葉鍵板|Ha-Kagi Ita}}.<ref name="BBS-chrono">{{citeweb|url=http://nippoudairi.2-d.jp/hakagi_ita/nenpyou/|title=Chronology of the Leaf, Key BBS|accessdate=2007-12-16|language=Japanese}}</ref><ref name="Leaf-Key-BBS">{{citeweb|url=http://pie.bbspink.com/leaf/|title=Leaf, Key BBS|accessdate=2007-12-16|language=Japanese}}</ref> The board originated from 2ch's [[video game]] discussion board due to a dispute involving the game ''[[Kizuato]]'' in December 1999;<ref name="BBS-chrono"/> ''Kizuato'' was an early game of another visual novel producing company named [[Leaf (company)|Leaf]]. Ultimately, fans of the game moved to 2ch's [[Eroge|adult game]] board, but there was not much resolution, and at the time Key fans on the board were being shunned for discussions on ''Kanon'' and, at the time, Key's upcoming game ''Air''. This resulted finally with the Leaf and Key fans moving away from 2ch and forming again on the PINKchannel Internet forum.<ref name="Leaf-Key-BBS"/> The board serves as a discussion board for anything related to Leaf and Key. This includes the games the companies produce, but also the companies themselves and the staff that make up those companies. The BBS gets approximately 1500 posts per day as of November 2007. Like 2ch, the board has a default [[Anonymous (group)|anonymous]] posting setting, and the default name is {{Nihongo|"Nanashi-san Dayomon"|名無しさんだよもん||lit. "Mr. Nameless-dayomon"}}, a reference to the heroine [[One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e#Main characters|Mizuka Nagamori]] from ''[[One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e]]'' who uses the words "dayo" and "mon" frequently.<ref name="Leaf-Key-BBS"/>
