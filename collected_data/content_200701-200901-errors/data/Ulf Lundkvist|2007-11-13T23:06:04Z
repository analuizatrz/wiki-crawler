'''Ulf Lundkvist''' (born [[1952]]) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[list of comic creators|comic creator]], illustrator, and painter. A [[nostalgia]] buff in love with the 1940s, 50s, and 60s, Lundkvist depicts the "old Sweden" with humor and affection, small towns and countryside, anachronistic places where time seem to stand still. 

Lundkvist's most famous comic is probably the strip ''Assar'', the absurd story about a [[hot dog]] who gains sentience and escapes his fate to seek adventure.
