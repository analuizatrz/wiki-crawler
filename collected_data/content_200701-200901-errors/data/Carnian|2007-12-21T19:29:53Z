:''For the Carnian Alps, see [[Carnic Alps]].''

The '''Carnian''' (less commonly, '''Karnian''') is the first [[faunal stage|stage]] of the Upper [[Triassic]] Period. Its boundaries are not characterized by major extinctions or biotic turnovers, but a climatic event (known as the Carnian Pluvial Event) occurred during the Carnian and seems to be associated with important extinctions or radiations.

==Naming==
The Carnian was named in [[1869]] by [[Johann August Georg Edmund Mojsisovics von Mojsvar|Mojsisovics]]. It is unclear if it was named after the [[Carnic Alps]] or after the Austrian region of [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] (''Kärnten'' in German). The name, however, was first used referring to a part of the Hallstatt Limestone cropping out in [[Austria]].

==Dating and subdivisions==
There is not an established, standard usage for the Carnian subdivisions, thus, while some authors use a two-substage subdivision:
* Julian
* Tuvalian
others prefer a three-substage organization of the stage as follows:
* Cordevolian
* Julian
* Tuvalian

The Carnian spans from 228.0 ± 2.0 to 216.5 ± 2.0 [[mega-annum|Ma]] in the [[geologic time scale]] by Gradstein et al. ([[2004]]). These dates are interpolated, because direct [[radiometric dating|radiometric dates]] for this stage were missing when that time scale was compiled. Recently, Upper Carnian beds in southern Italy yielded an age of 230.91 ± 0.33 [[mega-annum|Ma]]. The age and duration of the Carnian need thus to be reconsidered.

==Definition==
The base of the Carnian stage is not yet formally defined. The leading [[GSSP]] candidate is at Prati di Stuores/Stuores Wiesen, in Badia Valley, [[South Tyrol]], [[Italy]]. The proposed base of the Carnian is at the First Occurrence of the ammonoid ''Daxatina canadensis''. Other possible candidate sections are in Spiti, Indian [[Himalayas]], and at New Pass in [[Nevada]].

==Paleogeography and climate==
The paleogeography of the Carnian was basically the same as for the rest of the Triassic. Most continents were merged into the supercontinent [[Pangaea]], and there was a single global ocean, [[Panthalassa]]. The global ocean had a western branch at tropical latitudes called [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean|Paleo-Tethys]]. The sediments of Paleo-Tethys now crop out in southeastern [[Europe]], in the [[Middle East]], in the [[Himalayas]], and up to the [[Timor|island of Timor]].

The extreme land-sea distribution led to "mega-monsoons", i.e., an atmospheric [[monsoon|monsoon regime]] more intense than the present one.

As for most of the Mesozoic, there were no ice caps. Climate was mostly arid in the tropics, but an episode of wet tropical climate is documented at least in the Paleo-Tethys. This putative climatic event is called the “Carnian Pluvial Event”, its age being between latest early Carnian (Julian) and the beginning of late Carnian (Tuvalian). The nature of this event is still discussed; some scientists believe it is only an artifact, due to the [[continental drift|migration of continents]] of the Tethyan area across the equatorial climatic belt. Following this idea, the apparent shift from arid to humid, and then back to arid climate simply testifies the continents going from southern tropical, to equatorial, and then to northern tropical latitudes.

==Life in the Carnian==
===Plants===
In the marine realm, the Carnian saw the first abundant occurrences of calcareous nannoplankton, a morphological group including the [[Coccolithophore]]s.

===Invertebrates===
There are a few invertebrates which are typical and characteristic of the Carnian. Among molluscs, the [[ammonite|ammonoid]] genus ''Trachyceras'' is exclusive of the lower Carnian (i.e., Julian of the two-substages subdivision, see above). The family tropitidae and the genus Tropites appear at the base of the upper Carnian (Tuvalian). The [[bivalvia|bivalve]] genus ''Halobia'', a bottom-dweller of deep sea environments, differentiated from ''Daonella'' at the beginning of this age. [[Scleractinia]]n coral reefs, i.e., reefs with corals of the modern type, became relatively common for the first time in the Carnian.

===Vertebrates===
The earliest [[dinosaur]] [[Eoraptor]] originated slightly before the Carnian stage began around 230 [[Annum|Ma]], nevertheless, the oldest well documented dinosaurian assemblage, in the [[Ischigualasto Formation]] of [[Argentina]], is most probably late Carnian in age.

[[Conodont]]s are present in Triassic marine sediments. ''Paragondolella polygnathiformis'' appears at the base of the Carnian stage, and is perhaps the most characteristic species.

==Classic localities and Lagerstätten== 
The lower Carnian fauna of the San Cassiano Formation ([[Dolomites]], northern [[Italy]]) is studied since the 19th century. Fossiliferous localities are many, and are distributed mostly in the surroundings of [[Cortina d'Ampezzo]] and in the high Badia Valley, near the village of San Cassiano, after which the formation was named. This fauna is extremely various, including ammonoids, gastropods, bivalves, echinoderms, calcareous sponge, corals, brachiopods, and a variety of less common fossils. A collection of this fauna is exposed in the “Museo delle Regole”, a museum in Cortina d'Ampezzo.

The Ischigualasto Formation of northwestern Argentina yielded a very important vertebrate association, including the oldest dinosaurian assemblage.
