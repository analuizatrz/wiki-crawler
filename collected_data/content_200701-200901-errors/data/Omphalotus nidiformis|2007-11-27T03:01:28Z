'''''Omphalotus nidiformis''''', or '''ghost fungus''', is a gill [[mushroom]] found in southern Australia most notable for its [[bioluminescence|bioluminescent]] properties. Its scientific name is derived from the [[Latin]] ''nidus'' "nest", hence "nest shaped". Similar in appearance to the [[oyster mushroom]], it was previously considered a member of the same genus, ''[[Pleurotus]]'',  and described under the former names ''Pleurotus nidiformis'' or ''Pleurotus  lampas''. However, it is [[poison]]ous and while not lethal, consuming this mushroom leads to very severe [[cramp]]s, [[vomit]]ing, and [[diarrhea]]. Poisonings have occurred over confusion with [[oyster mushrooms]].  

It is one of several species with bioluminescent properties occurring worldwide, all of which are poisonous.

==Taxonomy and naming==
The ghost fungus was initially described in 1844 by English naturalist [[Miles Joseph Berkeley]] as ''Pleurotus nidiformis'', before being later placed in the genus ''[[Omphalotus]]'' with other bioluminescent mushrooms by [[Orson K. Miller, Jr.]] in 1994.<ref>(1994) ''Mycol. helv.'' '''6'''(2): 93 </ref> Material had been collected by [[James Drummond]] in 1841 from the [[Swan River]] and described by Berkeley as both this and ''Pleurotus lampas''. The latter name persisted in some texts but has been synonymised with this species.

Several species with similar bioluminescent properties occur worldwide, all of which are poisonous. The best known are the North American jack o'lantern mushroom (''[[Omphalotus olearius]]'') and the '''Tsukiyotake''' (''[[Omphalotus japonicus]]'' (Kawam.) Kirchm. & O.K. Mill., aka ''Lampteromyces japonicus'' (Kawam.) Sing.) found in [[Japan]] and eastern [[Asia]]. A recent molecular study shows the ghost fungus to be most closely related to the western jack o'lantern mushroom, ''[[Omphalotus olivascens]]'', which is abundant in Southern and Central [[California]].<ref>Kirchmair M, Morandell S, Stolz D, Pöder R (2004) Phylogeny of the genus ''Omphalotus'' based on nuclear ribosomal DNA-sequences.   ''Mycologia'' '''96''' 1253-1260</ref>

== Description ==
The fruiting body of the ghost fungus can be found on dead or diseased wood, where it causes white heart rot. A saprobe or parasite, it is nonspecific in its needs and can be found on native ''[[Banksia]]'', ''[[Hakea]]'' or ''[[Acacia]]'' and various [[Myrtaceae]] as well as introduced trees such as ''[[Pinus]]'' or ''[[Platanus]]'' species.

The cap is generally cream in colour, though often tinted with orange, brownish, greyish or purple shades. Growing up to 25 cm (11 in) in diameter it is funnel-shaped or fan-shaped in appearance. The cream-white gills are decurrent and often drip with moisture. The stubby stem is 2-7 cm (1-3 in) long and tapers to the base. The thin flesh is creamy white in colour. There is no distinctive smell or taste. The spore print is white.

Its bioluminescence is best seen in low-light conditions when the [[eye]] develops [[night vision]]. The gills are the most luminescent part of the fungus, emitting a greenish light which fades with age. The light allegedly can be bright enough to read by.

==Distribution and habitat==
It occurs in south western [[Western Australia]], where it was first recorded by Drummond, and south eastern Australia, from eastern [[South Australia]] through to southeast [[Queensland]]. It also occurs in [[Tasmania]].

==Biochemistry==
''Omphalotus nidiformis'' is not edible. Though reputedly mild tasting, eating it will result in vomiting. The toxic ingredient is thought to be a [[sesquiterpene]] compound known as [[illudin]], which is also responsible for its bioluminescence.
