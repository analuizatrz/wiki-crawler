The '''red imported fire ant''' (''Solenopsis invicta''), or simply '''RIFA''', is one of over 280 members of the widespread [[genus]] ''[[Fire ant|Solenopsis]]''. Although the red imported fire ant is native to [[South America]], it is best known in the [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[Taiwan]], [[Philippines]], and the southern [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] province of [[Guangdong]]. In [[January 2005]], several [[ant-hill]]s belonging to fire ants were found in northern [[Hong Kong]]. Later, after a thorough search for the ant was conducted there, several hundred ant-hills were found in different parts of Hong Kong. There were also reports of ant hills in [[Macau]], the former Portuguese enclave that borders the province of Guangdong. They have recently been introduced in the [[Philippines]] in [[July 2005]] when a cargo plane coming from [[Texas]] via [[California]] arrived in [[Manila]].

Colonies were accidentally introduced into the United States in the [[1930s]] through the seaport of [[Mobile, Alabama]]. Cargo ships from Brazil docking at Mobile unloaded goods infested with the ants; they have since spread from Alabama to the coastal plain and piedmont of almost all of the southeastern states, as well as into California. The ants were accidentally introduced into Australia in [[2001]], in a similar way.

==Overview==
RIFA are more aggressive than most native ant species and have a painful sting. A person typically encounters them by inadvertently stepping into one of their mounds, which causes the ants to swarm up the person's legs, attacking ''en masse.'' The ants respond to [[pheromone]]s that are released by the first ant to attack. The ants then swarm and immediately sting when any movement is sensed.

RIFA are efficient competitors to other ants, and have been successful at enlarging their range, notably in the United States, where they have gradually spread north and west despite intense efforts to stop them. Today they are found in most of the southeastern states, including [[Texas]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Louisiana]], [[Arkansas]], [[Mississippi]], [[Alabama]], [[Tennessee]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Florida]], [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], [[Maryland]], and [[Virginia]]. It is not uncommon for several fire ant mounds to appear suddenly in a suburban yard or a farmer's field, seemingly overnight. Even in the [[San Francisco, California]] area, there are large numbers of red imported fire ants. 

(At least one community uses the presence of fire ants as a publicity opportunity: [[Marshall, Texas]] hosts an annual [http://www.marshall-chamber.com/pages/fireants.php fire ant festival].)

RIFA are still on the move, often traveling from one area to another in turf, root balls of nursery plants, and other agricultural products. They are a pest, not only because of the physical pain they can inflict, but because their mound-building activity can damage plant roots and lead to loss of crops. Their stings are rarely life-threatening to humans and other large animals, causing only 80 documented deaths as of 2006. They often kill smaller animals such as birds. They sometimes kill newborn calves if the calves do not get on their feet quickly enough. The sting of the RIFA has venom composed of a [[necrosis|necrotizing]] [[alkaloid]] which causes both pain and the formation of white pustules which appear one day after the sting.

Red imported fire ants are extremely resilient and have adaptations to contend with both flooding and drought conditions. If the ants sense increased water levels in their nests, they will come together and form a huge ball or raft that is able to float on the water, with the workers on the outside and the queen inside. Once the ball hits a tree or other stationary object, the ants swarm onto it and wait for the water levels to recede. To contend with drought conditions, their nest structure includes a network of underground foraging tunnels and tunnels that extend down to the water table. Also, despite the fact that they do not hibernate during the winter, colonies can survive cold conditions as low as 16°F (&minus;9°C).

At present, RIFA in the United States can be controlled but not eradicated. A number of products are available, which can be used on a mound-by-mound basis to destroy ant colonies when they appear. With all such efforts, it is important to reach and kill the queens, which may be as far as six feet (2&nbsp;m) underground; otherwise, some queens may simply move a short distance away and quickly re-establish the colony.

==Body structure==
[[Image:RIFA.jpg|frame|Red imported fire ant]]

Fire ants are [[symmetrical]] along the body, meaning that the left part is a mirror image of the right. They have hardened [[exoskeleton]]s, a tough [[integument]]s for support and protection. They breathe through [[trachea]]e, like other terrestrial insects. 

Their bodies, like their relatives' (the [[bee]]s and [[wasp]]s), are divided into three major parts: [[head (anatomy)|head]], [[mesosoma]], and [[metasoma]]. They have three pairs of legs, and a pair of elbowed [[antenna (biology)|antenna]]e. The distinguishing characteristics of the Family Formicidae (the ants) are the presence of a pedicel or hump between the thorax and the gaster or abdomen of the insect. The Formicidae also have geniculate or elbowed antennae.

Red imported fire ants are further distinguished from the other ants by the presence of both a pedicel and postpediole.  In otherwords they belong to a group of ants that have two humps between the thorax and abdomen.  The workers have ten antennal segments terminating in a two segmented club.  It is often difficult to distinguish between the red imported fire ant ''Solenopsis invicta'' and the other species in the genus. A number of characters are used, but are not always consistent between the black imported fire ant (''Solenopsis richteri'')or hybrids between the two species. Positive ids can be made using High Performance Liquid Chromotography (HPLC) to distinguish differences in the cuticular hydrocarbons.  

As in other ants, the worker and soldier ants are sterile females. The queen is responsible for laying thousands of eggs. The number of males is low because they are only produced during a brief period of the year when mating swarms are emerging.

Contrary to what most people believe, a fire ant does not just “bite.” They use their jaws to anchor themselves and then, like a bee or wasp, inject [[venom]] using a sting at the tip of their abdomen. Using their strong mandibles to attach themselves to the victim’s flesh, they can sting many times continuously. They are extremely aggressive and have the ability to deliver venom in unison.

Since their accidental importation from South America into North America in the [[1930s]], the RIFA population has increased its territorial range to include most of the [[Southern United States]]. They build mounds, no larger than 46&nbsp;cm (18&nbsp;in) in diameter and 46&nbsp;cm (18&nbsp;in) in height, on soil close to homes and other buildings, and sometimes forage indoors for food and moisture. They are a nuisance and can threaten sleeping or bedridden individuals, and pets. Occasionally they feed on vegetable plants in home gardens. The worst damage usually occurs during hot, dry weather when they invade flowerbeds while seeking warmth and moisture. If disturbed, fire ants bite and sting the intruder. 

They are somehow attracted to electrical fields{{fact}} and crawl into air conditioning units and the [[electrical wiring]] of stoplights, shorting them out. This is the leading cause of traffic light shorts in [[Texas]], where the ants cause more than US$140 million in damage each year.

The FDA estimates that more than US$5 billion is spent annually on medical treatment, damage, and control in RIFA-infested areas. Further, the ants cause approximately US$750 million in damage to agricultural assets, including vet bills and livestock loss as well as crop loss.<ref>{{cite journal | last=McDonald | first=Maggie | title=Reds Under Your Feet (interview with Robert Vander Meer) | journal=NewScientist | volume=189 | issue=2538 | year=2006 | month=February | pages=50 }} </ref>

Fire ants are excellent natural predators and are biological controls for pests such as the [[sugarcane borer]], the [[rice stink bug]], the [[striped earwig]], [[aphid]]s, the [[boll weevil]], the [[soybean looper]], the [[cotton leafworm]], the [[hornfly]], and many other pests harmful to crops. However, they also kill beneficial [[pollinator]]s such as ground-nesting [[bee]] species. Seeds, fruits, leaves, roots, bark, nectar, sap, fungi, and carrion are all fire-ant prey, and they are not shy from creating their own [[carrion]] either. They are proficient enough at overwhelming intruders that they can virtually clear an area of invertebrates, lizards, and ground-dwelling birds.

Since September 2004, [[Taiwan]] has been seriously affected by the red fire ant. A few people are reported to have succumbed to venom from the ant stings. A large campaign to kill the ants has been partially effective, but it has not been able to eliminate all of them. 

In [[People's Republic of China|China]] in [[January 2005]], a controversy arose when it became known that [[Guangdong]]'s provincial government had suppressed all information about the spread of fire ants in the province since the middle of [[2004]]. [[Hong Kong]] newspapers, including ''Appledaily'', ''Mingpao'', ''Hong Kong Economic Times'', ''Singtao'' and ''Takungpao'' (the latter funded by the Chinese government), have also reported that the ants have been found in both [[Shenzhen]] and [[Wuchuan]] in [[Guangdong province]]. 

According to a press briefing of the [[Agriculture]], Fisheries and Conservation Department of Hong Kong, the city authorities have also located several [[ant-hill]]s of ''Solenopsis invicta'' in an artificial [[wetland]] in Hong Kong's northwestern section. 

There has also been reports of ant-hills being reported in [[Metro Manila]] and [[Cavite|the Province of Cavite]] in the Philippines since [[July 2005]].

An outbreak of RIFA in [[Queensland]] was discovered on [[22 February]] [[2001]]. It is believed that the ants were present in shipping containers arriving to the Port of Brisbane from the United States. Anecdotal evidence suggests fire ants may have been present in Australia for six to eight years prior to formal identification. While the outbreak is restricted to a small region of southeast Queensland near Brisbane, the potential social, economic, and ecological damage prompted the Australian government to respond rapidly. The initial emergency response was followed by the formation of the Fire Ant Control Centre in September 2001. Joint state and federal funding of [[Australian dollar|A$]]175,000,000 was granted for a 6-year eradication program involving the employment of more than 600 staff and the broad-scale baiting of approximately 678.9&nbsp;km² between 8 and 12 times, followed by two years of surveillance. Following the completion of the fourth year of the eradication program, the Fire Ant Control Centre estimates eradication rates of greater than 99% from previously infested properties.

==Countermeasures==
Red imported fire ants have virtually no natural [[Biological pest control|biological control agents]] in the [[United States]], [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[Philippines]], or [[Australia]]. Many scientists and agencies are attempting to develop methods to stop the spread of the RIFA.

Traditionally, control of RIFA has been achieved through [[pesticide]] use, but current research is introducing natural enemies of the ant. The microsporidian [[protozoa]]n ''Thelohania solenopsae'' and the [[fungus]] ''[[Beauveria bassiana]]'' are promising [[pathogen]]s. ''Pseudacteon tricuspis'' and ''Pseudacteon curvatus'' are [[parasite|parasitoid]] [[phorid fly|phorid flies]] from [[South America]] (more below). ''Solenopsis daguerri'' (Santschi), a parasitic ant, invades RIFA colonies to replace the queen in hopes of gaining control of the colony. For this reason, its use as a biological control agent is also being explored.

A few species of phorid flies, found in the ants' native habitat in South America, parasitize the ants. The female flies each lay an egg at the junction of head and thorax of their victims, prompting a jerky dance maneuver by the ants. The larva then slowly consumes the contents of the head, decapitating the ant in the process, and using the exoskeleton as a pupal case.

Phorid flies have been introduced in many places in southeastern United States, and are slowly reproducing and spreading to cover the entire RIFA range. The amount of actual damage done by phorid flies is minimal, but the ants appear to be aware of the hovering flies, losing their social organization and ceasing foraging, thus causing much greater damage in the long run. In addition, phorid flies are very species-specific, and should in theory leave native ant species (the fire ants' prime competitor) unmolested.

In some cases, hastily adopted biological control agents can do more harm than good (such as the [[mosquitofish]] in Australia), and it remains to be seen how much success that the biological control of the red imported fire ant will have.

Researchers have also been experimenting with extreme temperature change to exterminate RIFA, such as injecting liquid nitrogen or pressurized steam into RIFA nests.  Folk remedies have often sought a rapid ''increase'' in temperature by soaking the nest in [[gasoline]] or [[kerosine]] and lighting it on fire, but this is potentially dangerous and should not be attempted.
