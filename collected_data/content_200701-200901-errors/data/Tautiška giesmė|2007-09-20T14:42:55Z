'''"Tautiška giesmė"''' is the [[national anthem]] of [[Lithuania]]. The music and lyrics were written in [[1898]] by Dr. [[Vincas Kudirka]]. The fifty word poem was a condensing of Kudirka's ideas for the Lithuanian state, the Lithuanian people and her proud past. Shortly after his death in 1899, the song was played to Lithuanians living in Russia. The first Lithuanian performance occurred in [[Vilnius]] in 1905, and became the official national anthem in [[1919]]. In 1950, the [[Soviet]] government replaced ''Tautiška giesmė'' with their own anthem. The lyrics, written in 1950 and modified after Stalin's death, stated about working together with all peoples and how Communism "will light the Earth." During the 1980s, when Lithuania was working towards its independence, "Tautiška giesmė" was sung and performed more frequently, and was reinstated as the national anthem in 1992, when the new [[Constitution]] was ratified. The status of ''Tautiška giesmė'' as the state anthem was solidified in 1999 by the passage of a national law.

== Creation ==
At the time when the poem ''Lietuva, Tevyne musu'' were written, Lithuania was under the control of the [[Russian Empire]]. Kudirka, a medical student at the [[University of Warsaw]], was writing as a columnist for the newspaper ''[[Varpas]]'' (The Bell). In his columns of Varpas, Kudirka wrote about how Lithuanians should be a proud people, the problems the Russian Government were causing the Lithuanian population and denounced those who wished to work for the Russians. In the course of writing for Varpas, he wrote down his thoughts on what Lithuania was and what it should be, resulting in the fifty word poem called ''Lietuva, Tevyne musu'' (Lithuania, Our Homeland). The poem described the heroic past of Lithuania and expressed hope for her people to care for the land, care for humanity and to live in honor. Kudirka also hoped for the country to become a source of light, prosperity and to shake off ignorance. Without a melody, Kurdika took time to compose the music while laying on his death bed due to [[tuberculosis]]. Both the melody and the lyrics were printed in Varpas in September of 1898. Upon his death in 1899, his tomb was engraved with the second stanza of the anthem (later destroyed by the authorities).<ref>The Lithuanian Word [http://www.spaudos.lt/Istorija/Vincas_Kudirka.en.htm Vincas Kudirka].

== History ==
Shortly after Kudrika's death, the first performance of the poem occurred at a concert in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1899. The concert was conducted by Ceslovas Sasnauskas and was attended by Lithuanians, which St. Petersburg has the largest population at the time. The first performance of the poem in Lithuania occurred around the [[Great Seimas of Vilnius]] on [[December 3]], [[1905]]. When Lithuania declared their independence from Russia in 1919, the song was declared as the state anthem. This was continued until Lithuania was annexed into the [[Soviet Union]] after [[World War II]].<ref>http://www2.omnitel.net/ramunas/Lietuva/lt_emblem_anthem.shtml</ref> Before the Soviet takeover, there were suggestions to modify the words, mostly to include a reference to God. It was decided, in Kudrika's memory, that the lyrics to remain intact.<ref>[[Encyclopedia Lituanica]], "National anthem", volume IV, pages 24-26</ref>

During the Soviet era, an anthem was created for the republic starting in 1950. The music was composed by [[Balys Dvarionas]] and [[Jonas Švedas]], and the words were written originally by [[Antanas Venclova]]. Due to the death of [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1953, the lyrics were modified by [[Vacys Reimeris]] to [[Destalinization|remove instances of his name]]. The overall theme of the anthem stated how the Lithuanian people will work with peoples of the other [[Soviet Republics]], the struggles they took to achieve happiness and how [[Communism]] will be the source of light for the world. The song was continued to be used until Lithuania broke away from the Soviet Union.

Lietuva, Tėvyne mūsų,<br>
Tu didvyrių žeme,<br>
Iš praeities Tavo sūnūs<br>
Te stiprybę semia.

Tegul Tavo vaikai eina<br>
Vien takais dorybės,<br>
Tegul dirba Tavo naudai<br>
Ir žmonių gėrybei.

Tegul saulė Lietuvoj<br>
Tamsumas prašalina,<br>
Ir šviesa, ir tiesa<br>
Mūs žingsnius telydi.

Tegul meilė Lietuvos<br>
Dega mūsų širdyse,<br>
Vardan tos Lietuvos<br>
Vienybė težydi!}}
