The '''Swedish Armed Forces''' ({{lang-sv|Försvarsmakten}}), is a [[Government agencies in Sweden|Government agency]] responsible for the operation of the [[armed force]]s of [[Sweden]]. 

Sweden does not have a system to defend Sweden. Instead, the primary task of the agency is to train and deploy military forces abroad, while concurrently maintaining the long-term ability to mobliize some few, small military units in Sweden. 

There are three service branches: [[Swedish Army|Army]], [[Swedish Air Force|Air Force]] and [[Swedish Navy|Navy]], all reporting to the [[Government_agencies_in_Sweden#Ministry_of_Defence|Ministry of Defence]]. The head of the armed forces is the [[Supreme Commander of the Swedish Armed Forces|Supreme Commander]] (''Överbefälhavaren'', ''ÖB'') who is, apart from the [[Monarch of Sweden|Sovereign]], the highest ranking officer in the country.

Sweden's military is built on [[conscription]], and until the end of the [[Cold War]] nearly all males reaching the age of military service were conscripted. In recent years, the number of conscripted males has been reduced dramatically, while the number of female [[volunteer]]s has increased slightly. Recruitment has generally shifted towards finding the most motivated recruits, rather than solely on the otherwise most fit for service, although there are exceptions. All soldiers serving abroad are by law required to be volunteers. In 1975 the total number of conscripts was 45,000. By 2003 it was down to 15,000. After the Defence Proposition 2004, the number of troops in training will decrease even further to between 5,000 and 10,000 each year, which emphasizes the need to recruit only the soldiers later prepared to volunteer for international service. As of 2007, the government discussed dropping the peacetime draft altogether.

Today, the total manpower available to the Swedish Armed Forces when fully mobilized is said to consist of about 321,500. This stands in sharp contrast to the 1980's, before the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], when Sweden could gather up to 1,000,000 men when total mobilization had been declared; but the importance placed on defensive spending during the Cold War is perhaps best reflected by the fact that Sweden in the late 1950s ran the world's fourth-largest air force. This is now far from being the case. Indeed, after rapid draw-downs in the mid-to-late 1990s, there are now more admirals and generals in the Swedish Armed Forces force than there are ships and artillery pieces, respectively, for them to command.

As of 2006, wartime placement has been resumed, after being scrapped in 2003. At present Sweden can mobilise 321,500 men and women. This force includes 4,500 officers, 18,000 conscripts, 262,000 in the reserve and 37,000 [[Swedish Home Guard|Homeguards]] (National Guard. But mobilisation is assumed to take one year (although no mobilisation readiness exists), and the formations assumed are of battalion level. In a couple of months, 2,700 officers and 7,000 conscripts are available, with the state militias being available within hours<ref name="hv0702no1Facts">{{cite journal|last=Ivarsson|first=Ulf|title=Pendeln måste slå tillbaka|pages=5|journal=Hemvärnet|date=February 2007|issue=1}}</ref>

Currently, one of the Swedish Armed Forces' most important tasks is to serve as the lead nation of an [[European Union battle groups|EU Battle Group]] to which [[Norway]], [[Finland]], [[Estonia]] and [[Ireland]] are also contributing. The [[Nordic Battle Group]] (NBG) is presently on a 10-day deployment readiness until the end of the first half of [[2008]].

In Spring 2008 it was announced that several regiments of the Armed Forces may be disbanded in order to conserve national revenue.

== Doctrine ==
Usually, the adversary in tactical [[military exercise]]s and scenarios is thought to use equipment from the former [[Warsaw Pact]].  A common name for the [[Opposing_force|OPFOR]] has been "Stormakt Röd" (Great power Red)<ref name="stormaktrod">For use of the term "Stormakt röd" in regular media, see for example  [http://www.ltz.se/artikel_standard.php?id=38319&avdelning_1=103&avdelning_2=0 this editorial].</ref>.  Although a specific country is rarely mentioned for political reasons, there is a saying in the armed forces, "Fienden kommer alltid öster ifrån", The enemy always comes from the east.    Swedish equipment, training, and procedures are [[NATO]] interoperable, and most scenarios include some form of cooperation with one or more of the NATO members. Recent political decisions have strongly emphasized the will to participate in international operations, to the point where this has become the main short-term goal of training and equipment acquisition.  Sweden hopes to have the option of remaining [[neutral country|neutral]] in case of proximate war, and is therefore not a formal member of NATO.

== Capacity of the Army ==
The table describes briefly what Sweden currently has deployed abroad and may mobilize within one year. Some units may be mobilized faster at R30 and R90. Note. There are currently four training centers that produce mechanized and light mechanized units: LG (Life Guards), P4, P7 and I19.
{{Template:User Swedish miltary units}}

== Current deployments ==
Currently, Sweden has deployed military forces in the sea outside [[Lebanon]], in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Kosovo]]; further troops have been promised for a [[France|French]]-led [[EU]] mission in [[Chad]]. A promise was made in 2006 for the planned UN peacekeeping forces in [[Darfur]], [[Sudan]], but later retracted in 2008. [[observation|Observer]]s from Sweden have been sent to a large number of countries, including [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[North Korea]], [[Lebanon]], [[Israel]] and [[Sri Lanka]].

== Training ==
Officers are trained in the different combat schools and also at the [[Military Academy Karlberg]] which has establishments at [[Karlberg Palace]] in [[Stockholm]], and in [[Halmstad]].  [[Conscription|Conscript]]s are trained at the different units of the three branches, the purpose of which primarily being training installations and without significant wartime importance.

== Criticism ==
Some voices have been heard about the Swedish armed forces getting too thin and that more money should be spent on the forces in the homeland. The former Prime Minister [[Göran Persson]] did on August 14 2008 critise the current [[Swedish government]] not to spend enough money on the Armed Forces and that they should remember that Sweden still is a neutral country and should have a strong defence.<ref>http://svt.se/svt/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=22620&a=1217477</ref>. Also the party leader of the [[Liberal People's Party]], Jan Björklund, announced on August 20 that more budget cuts in the Swedish armed forces would give the wrong message to the rest of the world. He also sad that the lastest situation in [[2008 South Ossetia war|Georgia]] shows that a strong defence is still needed <ref>http://lund.lny.se/bjorklund-svanger-om-forsvarets-pengar-62764/</ref>. The [[Supreme Commander of the Swedish Armed Forces]], ''[[Håkan Syrén]]'', has replied to the budget cuts by saying that it was now not certain that Sweden could defend itself in an armed conflict<ref>http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=147&a=770132</ref>.

== Military ranks ==
{{Template:User SwedishMilitaryRanks2}}

The military introduced the rank of Brigadier General in 2001. The rank and the responsibilities associated with it existed before 2001, but all officers were commissioned as "Colonel First Class", or ''Överste av första graden'', i. e. not a General. The same goes for ''Flottiljamiral'' which used to be ''Kommendör av första graden'', or "Captain First Class". The background for this anomaly was a [[Politics of Sweden|political will]] to limit the number of Generals in the armed forces. The last [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Field Marshal]] to be appointed was [[Johan August Sandels]] in [[1824]]. The title was retained until 1972 as a wartime award. (It was never used as such practically due to Sweden not being to war since 1814.)
