{{Monarchy in Canada}}
{{Politics of Canada}}
{{dablink|The Canadian Monarchy is a shared monarchy.  This article describes the Monarchy from the perspective of [[Canada]]. In the other [[Commonwealth Realm]]s, the constitutional role of the Monarchy is similar, but the historical and cultural significance may differ. For information on the Monarchy in the other Realms, see [[Monarchy in Canada#See also|Other Realms]].}}

'''[[Canada]]''' is a '''[[constitutional monarchy]]''' and a [[Commonwealth Realm]], with [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] as its [[Queen regnant|reigning monarch]], since [[February 6]], [[1952]]. As such she is Canada's [[head of state]] and officially called [[Queen of Canada]]. 

Most of the Queen's political powers in Canada are exercised by the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]], though she does hold several powers that are hers alone. The Governor General is sometimes referred to as Canada's [[de facto head of state|''de facto'' head of state]].<ref>[http://www.gg.ca/governor_general/role_e.asp Governor General: Role]</ref>

There are several other members of the [[Canadian Royal Family]] besides those aforementioned, including the Queen's other children and cousins.

==Constitutional monarchy in Canada==

===International and domestic role===
One of the most complicated features of the Canadian Monarchy is that it is a shared monarchy.

Fifty-three states are members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. Sixteen of these countries are specifically [[Commonwealth Realm]]s who recognize, individually, the same person as their Monarch and [[Head of State]]; Canada is one of these. Despite sharing the same person as their respective national monarch, each of the Commonwealth Realms &mdash; including Canada &mdash; is sovereign and independent of the others.
{{See also|Personal union}} 

====Development of shared monarchy====
The [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]] provided the [[dominion]]s the right to be considered equal to Britain, rather than subordinate; an agreement that had the result of, in theory, a shared Crown that operates independently in each Realm rather than a unitary British Crown under which all the [[Dominion]]s were secondary. The Monarchy thus ceased to be an exclusively British institution, although it has often been called "British" since this time (in both legal and common language) for reasons historical, legal, and of convenience. The [[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act, 1927]] was the first indication of this shift in law, further elaborated in the [[Statute of Westminster, 1931]].

Under the Statute of Westminster, Canada has a common monarchy with Britain and the other [[Commonwealth Realm]]s, and though laws governing the line of succession to the Canadian throne lie within the control of the Canadian Parliament, Canada cannot change the rules of succession without the unanimous consent of the other realms, unless explicitly leaving the shared monarchy relationship by means of a constitutional amendment. This situation applies symmetrically in all the other Realms, including the UK. These concepts were reasserted by Justice Rouleau in a 2003 [[O'Donohue v. Canada|court ruling]] in which he wrote that "Union under the... Crown together with other Commonwealth countries [is a] constitutional principle."<ref>[http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2003/2003canlii41404/2003canlii41404.html O’Donohue v. Canada, 2003 CanLII 41404 (ON S.C.)]</ref>

On all matters of the Canadian State, the Monarch is advised solely by Canadian federal and provincial [[Minister (government)|minister]]s. Effective with the [[Constitution Act, 1982]], no British or other Realm government can advise the Monarch on any matters pertinent to Canada.<ref>In 1997, [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] intended to offer a [[Life Peer]]age to Canadian businessman [[Conrad Black]]. Citing the 1919 [[Nickle Resolution]], the Canadian government advised the Queen that they have objected to such honours for many years. If Blair had not backed down, the Queen would have been in the situation of having to grant an [[honour]] on the advice of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and to object to the same as Queen of Canada on the advice of then Prime Minister of Canada [[Jean Chrétien]]. The problem was resolved when Black renounced his Canadian citizenship. Canada raised no further objections and he was granted his peerage, becoming Lord Black of [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Crossharbour]].</ref>
{{See|Queen's Privy Council for Canada}}

====Title====
{{Main|Style of the Canadian Sovereign}}
In Canada, the Queen's official title is:
* In [[English language|English]]: ''Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom, Canada and Her other Realms and Territories Queen, [[Head of the Commonwealth]], [[Defender of the Faith]].''
* In [[French language|French]]: ''{{lang|fr|Elizabeth Deux, par la grâce de Dieu, Reine du Royaume-Uni, du Canada et de ses autres royaumes et territoires, Chef du Commonwealth, Défenseur de la Foi}}.''

This style reflects Canada's status as an independent monarchy as it mentions Canada separately from the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth Realms, to highlight the Monarch's role specifically as Queen of Canada, as well as the shared aspect of the Crown throughout the Realms. Typically, the Sovereign is styled "Queen of Canada," and is addressed as such when in Canada, or performing duties on behalf of Canada abroad.

Although the Queen's Canadian titles include "[[Defender of the Faith]]/''{{lang|fr|Défenseur de la Foi}}''," neither the Queen, not any of the Governors has any religious role in Canada; there have been no [[established church]]es in Canada since before [[Canadian Confederation|confederation]]. This is one of the key differences from the Queen's role in the United Kingdom where she is [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]].

====Representation of the State====
At one time the Monarchy was considered a purely British institution, when most Canadians still continued to be both legally, and by personal view, British subjects. However, paralleling the changes in constitutional law, and the evolution of Canadian nationalism, the cultural role of the Monarchy in Canada altered.

The federal and provincial governments now recognize and promote the Queen's role as Monarch of Canada as separate to her position as Monarch of the United Kingdom.<ref>[http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/about/people/senate//Monarchy/SenMonarchy_15-e.htm Canada: a Constitutional Monarchy]</ref><ref>[http://canada.gc.ca/howgoc/queen/quind_e.html Biography: Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II Queen of Canada]</ref><ref>[http://www.gr.gov.sk.ca/protocol/Practice/crown_in_canada.htm Saskatchewan Government Relations: The Crown in Canada]</ref>  Today the Sovereign is regarded as the personification of the Canadian [[State]], and is described by the [[Department of Canadian Heritage]] as the "personal symbol of allegiance, unity and authority for all Canadians."<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.pch.gc.ca/special/royalvisit/ENGLISH.pdf The Crown in Canada]|376&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 385993 bytes -->}}</ref> Elizabeth II stated in 1973:
: "But it is as Queen of Canada that I am here, Queen of Canada and of all Canadians, not just of one or two ancestral strains. I want the Crown to be seen as a symbol of national sovereignty belonging to all. It is not only a link between Commonwealth nations, but between Canadian citizens of every national origin and ancestry."
[[Image:Ottawa-1939.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The dedication of the [[National War Memorial (Canada)|National War Memorial]] in [[Ottawa]] by King [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]], as the personification of the state, and Queen [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Elizabeth]], 1939.]]

From time to time the Sovereign or another member of the Royal Family will also represent Canada abroad.  On these occasions they are acting as Sovereign of Canada and members of the [[Canadian Royal Family]].
:''Further information: [[Canadian Royal Family#Duties|Canadian Royal Family: Duties]]''

The [[Oath of Allegiance (Canada)|oath of allegiance]] to Canada, sworn by new [[citizenship|citizens]], the [[Canadian Forces]], [[police]] officers, and [[Parliament of Canada|parliamentarians]], is an oath of allegiance to the Monarch as Sovereign of Canada, and to his/her heirs and successors according to law.
{{See|Oath of citizenship (Canada)}}

====Finance====
Contrary to common misconception, Canadians do not pay any monies to the Queen, either for personal income or to support the Royal residences outside of Canada. Only when the Queen is in Canada, or acting abroad as Queen of Canada, does any Canadian government support her in the performance of her duties. This rule applies equally to other members of the [[Canadian Royal Family|Royal Family]]..<ref name="CCC">[http://www.monarchist.ca/new/docs/costofcrown.html ''The Cost of Canada's Constitutional Monarchy: $1.10 per Canadian'']</ref>

Provincial and federal records of expenditures associated with the Crown are kept, but no official report on the cost of the monarchy to Canadians is compiled. However, every three years the [[Monarchist League of Canada]] issues a survey, based on various federal and provincial government budgets, expenditures and estimates, that outlines a yearly cost for the functioning of the Crown. The 2005 survey found that the institution cost Canadians roughly $49 million in 2004.<ref>[http://www.monarchist.ca/new/docs/Report.pdf ''$1.53 per Canadian: The Cost of Canada's Constitutional Monarchy, 2005'']</ref> Previous surveys found that the overall cost of the Canadian Crown was $22 million in 1999<ref>[http://www.monarchist.ca/new/docs/costs.html ''The Cost of Canada's Constitutional Monarchy: 74 Cents per Canadian'']</ref> and $34 million in 2002.<ref name="CCC" /><ref>[http://members.tripod.com/~constantian/expense2.html The Constantian Society. The [[Constantian Society]]'s detailed comparison of the costs of monarchies versus [[republic]]s.]</ref> (This does not take into account the inflation of the [[Canadian Dollar]] over these years).

Usually the Queen's Canadian governments pay only for the costs associated with the Governor General and Lieutenant Governors in their exercising of the powers of the Crown on behalf of the Queen, including travel, security, residences, offices, ceremonial occasions, etc.<ref name="CCC" />

===Constitutional role===
[[Image:EIIR-Canadian Parliament.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] reads the [[Throne Speech]] in a joint session of the [[Canadian Parliament]], 1977, accompanied by her husband, [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]].]]

[[Constitution of Canada|Canada's constitution]] is made up of a variety of statutes and conventions that are either British or Canadian in origin, which gives Canada a similar parliamentary system of government as the other Commonwealth Realms.

All powers of State are constitutionally reposed in the Monarch, who is represented at the federal level by the [[Governor General of Canada]] - appointed by the Monarch upon the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Canada]] - and at the provincial level by [[Lieutenant-Governor (Canada)|Lieutenant Governor]]s - appointed by the Governor General upon the advice of the Prime Minister, in consultation with the relevant provincial premier; the Monarch is informed of the Prime Minister's decision before the Governor General gives Royal Assent.<ref>[http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/idb/forsey/index-e.asp Forsey, Eugene; ''How Canadians Govern Themselves''; Parliament of Canada]</ref>

====Duties====
Most of the Queen's domestic duties are performed by the Governor General at the national level and the Lieutenant Governors at the provincial level.

As in the other Commonwealth Realms, the Monarch's role, and thereby the vice-regal's role, is almost entirely symbolic and cultural, acting as a symbol of the legal authority under which all governments operate, and the powers that are constitutionally hers are exercised almost wholly upon the advice of the [[Cabinet of Canada|Canbinet]], made up of [[Minister of the Crown|Ministers of the Crown]].  It has been said since the death of [[Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] in 1714, the last monarch to head the British cabinet (when almost all of Canada was still French colonial territory), that the monarch "reigns" but does not "rule". In Canada, this has been true since the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]] ended the reign of Canada's last absolute monarch, King [[Louis XV of France]].

In exceptional circumstances, however, the Monarch or vice-regal has acted against such advice based upon his or her [[reserve power]]s — as when Governor General [[Baron Byng|Julian Byng]] refused a request by Prime Minister [[W.L. Mackenzie King|William Mackenzie King]] for a dissolution of Parliament and call for new elections. Also, [[Monarchy in Alberta|Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta]], [[John C. Bowen]], in 1937 refused to grant Royal Assent to three bills passed by [[William Aberhart]]'s [[Social Credit Party of Alberta|Social Credit]] government on the [[William Aberhart#Political career|grounds that they were unconstitutional]],<ref>[http://www.assembly.ab.ca/pub/gdbook/Part1/page2.htm The Citizen's Guide to the Alberta Legislature Part I: The Foundation]</ref> and [[Monarchy in Saskatchewan|Lieutenant-Governor of Saskatchewan]] [[Frank Lindsay Bastedo]] refused Royal Assent to a bill in [[1961]].<ref>[http://www.gr.gov.sk.ca/PDFs/Monarchy%20in%20Saskatchewan.pdf ''Monarchy in Saskatchewan'']</ref>
{{see|King-Byng Affair}}

There are also a few duties which must be specifically performed by, or bills that require assent by the [[Queen regnant|Queen]]. These include: signing the appointment papers of Governors General, the confirmation of awards of Canadian honours, and approving any change in her Canadian title.<ref>[http://www.empireclubfoundation.com/details.asp?SpeechID=562&FT=yes Speech by Governor General Roland Michener, Nov. 19, 1970]</ref> On occasion the Monarch must personally act directly in [[partisan (political)|partisan]] affairs. For example, this occurred when Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]] advised Queen Elizabeth II to expand the number of [[Canadian Senate|Senate]] seats to assure passage of the [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|GST]]. The Queen followed his advice, and as such, Mulroney became [[accountability|accountable]] for that [[advice]].

It is also possible that if the Governor General decided to go against the Prime Minister's or the government's advice, the Prime Minister could appeal directly to the Monarch, or even recommend that the Monarch dismiss the Governor General.
:''Further information: [[Governor General of Canada#Governmental role|Governor General of Canada: Governmental role]]''

====Provinces====
{{Main|Monarchy in the Canadian provinces}}
Across the country the Canadian Crown is unitary. Under this system the [[Head of State|headship of state]] is not a part of either the federal or provincial jurisdictions. The Queen reigns impartially over the country as a whole; meaning the [[sovereignty]] of the provinces is passed on not by the Governor General or the [[Parliament of Canada|Canadian Parliament]], but through the Crown itself.  This means that the Crown is "divided" into eleven legal jurisdictions; into eleven "crowns" - one federal and ten provincial.<ref>[http://www.monarchist.ca/cmnews/CMN_winter_spring_2003_Update-3.pdf Jackson, Michael; ''Canadian Monarchist News'': Golden Jubilee and Provincial Crown; Spring, 2003]</ref><ref>[http://www.monarchist.ca/cmnews/CMN_winter_spring_2003_Update-3.pdf Jackson, Michael; ''Canadian Monarchist News'': Golden Jubilee and Provincial Crown; Spring, 2003]</ref>

A [[Lieutenant-Governor (Canada)|Lieutenant Governor]] serves as the Queen's representative in each province, carrying out all the Monarch's constitutional and ceremonial duties of state on her behalf.

The [[Commissioner]]s of Canada's territories of [[Nunavut]], [[Yukon]], and [[Northwest Territories]] are appointed by the [[Queen-in-Council|Governor-in-Council]], at the recommendation of the federal [[Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (Canada)|Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development]]. But as the territories are not sovereign entities, the commissioners are ''not'' representatives of the Sovereign. They receive instruction from the said Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.
{{See|Lieutenant-Governor (Canada)}}

====Succession====
Succession to the throne is by [[primogeniture|male-preference primogeniture]], and governed by the provisions of the [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement]], as well as the [[English Bill of Rights]]. These documents, though originally passed by the [[Parliament of England]], are now part of Canadian constitutional law, under control of the Canadian parliament only.

This legislation lays out the rules that the Monarch cannot be a [[Roman Catholic]], nor married to one, and must be in communion with the [[Church of England]] upon ascending the throne. This has led to a legal challenge (''see [[O'Donohue v. Canada, 2003|O'Donohue v. Her Majesty the Queen]]''). As Canada's laws governing succession are currently identical to those of the United Kingdom (by the Statute of Westminster) see [[Succession to the British Throne]] for more information.

The [[heir apparent]] is Elizabeth II's eldest son, [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Charles]], who has no official title in Canada, but is accorded his UK title, [[Prince of Wales]], as a [[courtesy title]].<ref>[http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/special/royalvisit/english.htm Department of Canadian Heritage: Prince of Wales Royal Visit]</ref> The [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada]] is expected to proclaim him [[King of Canada]] upon his accession to the Throne upon the [[demise of the Crown]].

===Legal role===
All laws in Canada are enacted with the sovereign's, or the vice-regal's signature, though there is some debate over whether the monarch is constitutionally allowed to personally grant Royal Assent to provincial bills.  Thus, all bills begin with the phrase "Now, therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows."<ref>[http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Docid=2604319&file=4 Bill C43: ''An Act to provide for consultations with electors on their preferences for appointments to the Senate'']</ref>  The granting of a signature to a bill is known as [[Royal Assent]]; it and proclamation are required for all acts of Parliament and of the provincial legislatures, usually granted or withheld by the Governor General or Lieutenant-Governor, with the [[Great Seal of Canada]], or the appropriate provincial seal. The Vice-Regals may reserve a bill for the Monarch's pleasure, that is to say, allow the Monarch to make a personal decision on the bill. A Lieutenant-Governor of a province may similarly defer to the Governor General (who may in turn defer to the Monarch). The Monarch has the power to disallow a bill (within a time limit specified by the constitution). Recently activists opposed to [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|Bill C-38]] lobbied Queen Elizabeth II to disallow the legislation after it was passed by parliament. However it received Royal Assent from The Right Honourable Beverley McLachlin, Deputy of the Governor General on [[July 20]], [[2005]]. Territorial legislatures, unlike their provincial counterparts, are subject to the oversight of the Government of Canada.<ref>[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/N-27/252179.html Department of Justice Canada: ''Northwest Territories Act''; 1985]</ref><ref>[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/Y-2.01/265655.html Department of Justice Canada: ''Yukon Act''; 2000]</ref><ref>[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/N-28.6/index.html Department of Justice Canada: ''Nunavut Act''; 1993]</ref>

[[Image:Canadian_Supreme_Court_justices_circa_1950.jpg|right|thumb|In the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] is displayed the [[Coat of arms of Canada|Royal Arms of Canada]]]]
The Sovereign is deemed the "fount of justice," and is responsible for rendering justice for all subjects. The Sovereign does not personally rule in judicial cases; instead, judicial functions are performed in his or her name.  The common law holds that the Sovereign "can do no wrong"; the monarch cannot be prosecuted in his or her own courts for criminal offences.  Civil lawsuits against the Crown in its public capacity (that is, lawsuits against the government) are permitted; however, lawsuits against the Monarch personally are not cognizable. The Sovereign, and by extension the Governor General, also exercises the "prerogative of mercy," and may pardon offences against the Crown. Pardons may be awarded before, during, or after a trial.

In Canada the legal personality of the [[State]] is referred to as "Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada", and likewise for the provinces and territories (i.e., "in Right of Ontario," etc.).<ref>[http://arizonaenergy.org/images/ontario_mou_e.pdf ''Memorandum for Understanding of Cooperation on Addressing Climate Change''; May 21, 2004]</ref> For example, if a lawsuit is filed against the federal government, the respondent is formally described as Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada. The monarch as an individual takes no more role in such an affair than in any other business of government. For example, a case in which a party sues both a province and the federal government, the respondents would formally be called ''Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Saskatchewan and Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada''.<ref>[http://www.usask.ca/nativelaw/factums/claim.html Lac La Ronge Indian Band vs. HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN In Right of Canada, and HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN in Right of the Province of Saskatchewan; Q. B. No. 2655 of 1987]</ref> In this capacity, all [[Crown copyright]] is held by the Queen, either in Right of Canada or a relevant province.<ref>[http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/reference/national/can_political_e/map.pdf Natural Resources Canada: Map of Canada]</ref>

In addition, the Monarch also serves as a symbol of the legitimacy of Courts of Justice, and of their judicial authority. An image of the Queen or the [[Coat of Arms of Canada|Arms of Her Majesty in Right of Canada]] is always displayed in Canadian courtrooms, except in the province of [[British Columbia]] where the [[Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom|Arms of Her Majesty in Right of the United Kingdom]] are displayed as a symbol of its judiciary.<ref>[http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/index.asp Courts of British Columbia]</ref> [[Itinerant]] judges will display an image of the Queen and the Canadian flag when holding a session away from established courtrooms. Such situations occur in parts of Canada where the stakeholders in a given court case are too isolated geographically to be able to travel for regular proceedings.

===Cultural role===
[[Image:Victoriacrosscanadapostagestampimage.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The [[Victoria Cross (Canada)|Victoria Cross]] is the highest decoration in the [[Canadian honours system]]. Its motto "For Valour" was adopted on the recommendation of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]]]

{{rquote|right|''The Canadian Crown continues as a key element of our parliamentary democracy and an enduring symbol that represents all generations of Canadians and the best that is our country.''<ref>[http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/special/royalvisit2005/53_e.cfm Canadian Heritage: 2005 Royal Visit: The Queen and Canada: 53 Years of Growing Together]</ref>| [[Department of Canadian Heritage]], 2005}}

In Canada major [[public inquiries]] are called [[Royal Commission]]s, and are created by the [[Cabinet]] on behalf of the Monarch through a [[Royal Warrant]].

{{Main|Canadian royal symbols}}

Despite the removal or replacement of certain monarchical symbols as national symbols through the 1970s and 1980s, the Crown remains a visible part of the everyday lives of Canadians. What were formerly purely British symbols became symbols of the Monarch, or loyalty thereto.

The Monarchy is presently symbolised through images of the Sovereign on currency and in portraits in public buildings; in songs, toasts and salutes;<ref>[http://www.saskd.ca/heritage.pdf Department of National Defence: The Honours, Flags and Heritage Structure of the Canadian Forces; pg. 404]</ref><ref>[http://www.saskd.ca/heritage.pdf Department of National Defence: The Honours, Flags and Heritage Structure of the Canadian Forces; pg. 449-450]</ref> on [[Canadian honours system|Canadian decorations and honours]]; on provincial and [[Coat of Arms of Canada|national Coats of Arms]].  Certain key days are also reserved to celebrate the monarchy, notably [[Victoria Day]], the holiday for celebrating the Sovereign's birthday,<ref>[http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/jfa-ha/victoria_e.cfm Heritage Canada: Victoria Day]</ref> and the day of the [[Royal Christmas Message]], broadcast to the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] since 1932. 

There are also hundreds of places named for Canadian monarchs and members of the Royal Family all across Canada.  No individual has been more honoured than Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]] in the names of Canada's public buildings, streets, populated places and physical features.<ref>[http://www.canadianencyclopedia.ca/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0008358 ''The Canadian Encyclopedia'':Victoria]</ref>
{{See|National symbols of Canada}}

==== Royal presence ====
For over 200 years members of the Royal Family have visited or lived in Canada. Though all of the Royal Family currently lives outside of the country, members are still regular visitors, enough so that on occasion [[royal visits to Canada]] are also referred to by monarchists as "Royal Homecomings." These events are often marked with a variety of ceremonies, the granting of honours and general celebrations, even though these events are not always official holidays.

The Queen regularly undertakes tours of Canada to celebrate Canadian culture, milestone anniversaries, military remembrances, and the like. Other Royals will perform the same tasks in the Queen's place, from time to time, usually on a less grand scale or for events of a lesser importance. These tours are at the invitation of, organized, and paid for by the [[Government of Canada|Canadian government]], provincial government, or a combination of both; hence, they are called "official tours" or "official visits."<ref>[http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page4384.asp#2.5 Buckingham Palace: Guidelines and Procedures for the Acceptance, Classification, Retention and Disposal of Gifts to Members of the Royal Family]</ref>

==History==
{{main|History of monarchy in Canada}}
[[Image:Francis1-1.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Francis I of France]]; established colonies in [[Acadia]] and Canada, 1534]]

The first French and British colonizers of Canada interpreted the hereditary nature of some indigenous North American chieftainships as a form of monarchy, often referring to these leaders as kings and their lands as kingdoms.<ref>[http://www.angelfire.com/mi4/polcrt/4Chiefs.html The Four Indian Kings]</ref> There is also evidence that the aboriginals had an understanding of monarchy, most notably in the legend of the [[Kingdom of Saguenay]], and tales of "wealthy kingdoms in the north" told by [[Iroquois|Iroquoians]] to [[Jacques Cartier]] in 1534.<ref>[http://www.carsten-rex.de/History/history.html Canada: History]</ref><ref>[http://www.macleans.ca/switchboard/article.jsp?content=20031027_68038_68038 Ferguson, Will; ''The Lost Kingdom''; ''Macleans'', October 27, 2003]</ref>

Canada has been the territory of a monarchy, or a monarchy in its own right, since the establishment of [[New France]]. Territory of the [[List of French monarchs|French Crown]] was merged with the North American colonies under the [[British monarchy|British Crown]] with the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763. In 1867, Canada became a self-governing [[Dominion]] under the British Crown (originally intended to be named the [[Canada's name#Adoption of Dominion|Kingdom of Canada]]), and, from that date to the patriation of the Canadian constitution in 1982, Canada developed into a kingdom in its own right. Thus, kings and queens reigning over Canada have included the [[List of French monarchs|monarchs of France]] (from [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] in 1534 to [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] in 1763), [[List of British monarchs|those of the UK]] (from [[Anne of Great Britain]] in 1713 to [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] in 1952), to [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] as Queen of Canada today.

Canada's emergence as a sovereign constitutional monarchy, with a Crown separate to that of the United Kingdom, was demonstrated in the abdication of [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VIII]] in 1936; when Canada had to pass its own ''Succession to the Throne Act'', that effected changes to the rules of succession in Canada so that they matched those within the other Realms of the British Empire.<ref>[http://www.canlii.org/on/cas/onsc/2003/2003onsc11019.html O'Donohue v. Her Majesty The Queen in Right of Canada]</ref> A few years later Canada's new status was again demonstrated when [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] and [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Elizabeth]] traveled from Canada into the United States as [[Queen of Canada|King and Queen of Canada]].<ref>[http://www.collectionscanada.ca/05/0532/053201/053201130206_e.html The Royal Tour of 1939]</ref>  The ''[[Constitution Act of 1982]]'' entrenched the monarchy in Canada. Any change to the position of the monarch or the monarch's representatives in Canada now requires the consent of the [[Canadian Senate|Senate]], the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]], and the legislative assemblies of all the provinces.

Members of the Royal Family have been present in Canada since the late [[1700s]], either on military manoeuvres, for official tours, or as governors; various members of the Royal Family have served as the vice-regal representative of the British, and later Canadian monarch.  The present Queen has been in Canada more than any other monarch before her, having toured the country more than 22 times, being present for events such as the opening of the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]], the commemoration of the Charlottetown and Quebec conferences, Canada's centennial, the [[Expo 67|Montreal Expo]], her Proclamation of the Constitution Act 1982, her Silver and Golden Jubilees, and to mark the anniversaries of the entry of many provinces and territories into confederation.
{{see|Royal visits to Canada}}

Through the 1960s and 1970s, the rise of [[Quebec nationalism]] and changes in Canadian identity created an atmosphere where the purpose and role of the Canadian Monarchy [[Debate on the Canadian monarchy|came into question]]. Some references to the Monarch and the Monarchy were slowly removed from the public eye, and moves were made by the government to constitutionally alter the Monarchy's place and role in Canada. The premiers of the provinces reacted strongly against these proposals.<ref>[http://www.monarchist.ca/cmnews/Sum04PDFRepublicanism.pdf#search='quebec%20monarchy' Dr. Stephen Phillips; Republicanism in Canada in the reign of Elizabeth II: the dog that didn't bark]</ref>

In 1999, it was revealed that the federal government was again toying with the idea of changing Canada to a republic. When this information was leaked to the media and public, there was strong negative reaction, and even denial by the Prime Minister.

{{Main|The Canadian Crown and First Nations, Inuit and Métis}}

The Canadian Crown has a long relationship with the [[First Nations]], [[Inuit]], and [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] peoples of [[Canada]].

As with the [[Māori]] and the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] in [[New Zealand]], Canada's [[First Nations]] view their treaties as being agreements directly between them and the Crown, not with the ever-changing [[government of Canada]]. The ''[[Royal Proclamation of 1763]]'' remains an important document, mentioned in the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'', outlining the Canadian Crown's responsibility to protect First Nations' territories.<ref>[http://www.ualberta.ca/~nativest/pim/waitangi.htm A Historical Analysis of Early Nation to Nation Relations in Canada and New Zealand:The Royal Proclamation of 1763, the Treaty of Niagra and The Treaty of Waitangi]</ref><ref>[http://www.treaty6.ca/princ.html Fundamental Treaty Principals]</ref>

Over the centuries there have been literal and symbolic gestures to demonstrate the "nation-to-nation" relationship, from the commemoration by [[Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] of the "[[Four Mohawk Kings]]" in 1710,<ref>[http://www.tyendinaga.net/history/ Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory]</ref> to Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] donating a piece of [[Balmoral]] granite engraved with the ciphers of [[Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] and herself to the [[First Nations University of Canada]] in 2005.<ref>[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/Page/document/v5/content/subscribe?user_URL=http://www.theglobeandmail.com%2Fservlet%2FArticleNews%2FTPStory%2FLAC%2F20050511%2FNATIVES11%2FTPNational%2FCanada&ord=1169237438207&brand=theglobeandmail&force_login=true Monchuk, Judy; ''The Globe and Mail'': Natives decry 'token' presence for Queen's visit; May 11, 2005]</ref>

==The Crown and the Canadian Forces==

{{Main|The Canadian Crown and the Canadian Forces}}
The Crown holds a prominent place within the [[Canadian Forces]]. The Queen is the [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the entire Forces, though the Governor General holds this title and exercises the duties on behalf of the Sovereign.<ref>[http://www.gg.ca/gg/rr/cc/hist_e.asp Governor General of Canada: Commander in Chief of the Canadian Forces]</ref> The Queen is also the Honorary Commissioner of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]].<ref>[http://www.regiments.org/biography/royals/1926eliz.htm Land Forces: H.M. Elizabeth II Queen of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]</ref>

The Sovereign's position and role in the military is reflected by Canadian [[navy|naval vessels]] bearing the prefix [[Her Majesty's Canadian Ship]] (HMCS) (subsequently His Majesty's Canadian Ship during the reign of a king), and all members of the armed forces must swear allegiance to the Queen and her heirs and successors.  Members of the Royal Family are also [[Colonel-in-Chief]] of many Canadian regiments.
:''Further information: [[List of Canadian organizations with royal patronage#Military|List of Canadian Organizations with royal patronage — Military]]''

Members of the Canadian Royal Family have presided over many military ceremonies both abroad and at home, including [[Trooping the Colour]]s, inspections of the troops, and anniversaries of key battles; whenever the Sovereign or a member of her family is in Ottawa, they lay a wreath at the [[National War Memorial (Canada)|National War Memorial]].



==Organizations with royal association==
===Organizations under Royal Charter===
{{Main|Royal Charter}}
A [[Royal Charter]] is granted by the [[Monarch]] on the advice of the [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada]] thich creates or gives special status to an incorporated body. This is an exercise of the Royal Prerogative, and, in Canada, there are hundreds of organizations under Royal Charters. Such organisations include charities, businesses, colleges, universities, and cities.  Today, it is mostly charities and professional institutions who receive Royal Charters.

Examples of organizations under Royal Charter are [[Hudson's Bay Company]], founded by Royal Charter issued by [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] in 1670;<ref>[http://www.pch.gc.ca/special/royalvisit/royal-quiz-answers.htm Department of Canadian Heritage: Test your royal skills]</ref> [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], receiving its charter in 1786 from [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]];<ref>[http://www.canadascities.ca/caoreport_062000_1.htm#3 ''Canada's Cities: Unleash our Potential'']</ref> and [[McGill University]], which received a Royal Charter from [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]] in 1821.

===Canadian Organizations with Royal Patronage===
Until [[Industrial Revolution|modern industrial]] times, all development of the [[Science]]s and the [[Art]]s were under the direct control of the [[Monarch]], exercised by the foundation of [[college]]s that today form the basis of modern [[Universities]]. The endowments to provide for these colleges were provided by [[the Crown]] to further education in both ecclesiastical and [[secularism|secular]] matters.

As time progressed, the educated members of these organisations formed into groups to lecture, demonstrate and [[debate]] their various subjects. These groups either sought Royal Patronage or were created as [[memorial]]s for the predecessors of the reigning monarch. Other colleges and foundations have been endowed by the owners of the great [[Estate (law)|landed estates]] and, in later times, by industrialists and finally modern [[corporation|corporate bodies]].  However, even in present times, relatively new organisations still seek Royal Patronage, though it is a ceremonial function wherein the royal will either volunteer their time for service or make a charitable donation.  To receive Royal Patronage, an organisation must prove to be long lasting.
{{see|List of Canadian organizations with royal patronage}}

==Awards and charities==
A number of awards in Canada are issued in the name of previous or present members of the Royal Family. These include:

* The [[National Hockey League|NHL's]] ''[[Prince of Wales Trophy]]'', donated by and named for [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward, Prince of Wales]]

Charities and volunteer organizations have also been founded as gifts to, or in honour of some of Canada's monarchs, or members of the Royal Family.  These include:
* The [[Victorian Order of Nurses]] was a gift to Queen Victoria for her [[Diamond Jubilee#Diamond Jubilee for Queen Victoria|Diamond Jubilee]] in 1897

==Debate==
{{main|Debate on the monarchy in Canada}}

To date, there has been little national debate about ending the Monarchy in Canada, in contrast to some other [[Commonwealth Realm]]s where the issue has gained a relatively higher profile.  Many Canadians continue to be unaware that the Queen serves as their Head of State; a 2002 [[EKOS Research Associates|EKOS]] poll found that only five percent of Canadians could correctly identify Elizabeth II as Canada's Head of State (the majority believing it to be the Prime Minister).<ref>[http://www.ekos.com/admin/articles/31may2001.pdf Eskos poll]</ref>

Where debate does exist, it tends to be a largely academic one, and several books have been authored that explore the subject from a [[political science]] perspective. Neither of Canada's two main political parties, the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] or the [[Conservative Party of Canada]], are officially in favour of abolishing the Monarchy; though the latter makes support for constitutional monarchy a founding principle in its Policy Declaration.<ref>[http://www.conservative-own.ca/documents/policy031905.pdf#search='conservative%20party%20of%20canada%20objectives%20monarchy' Conservative Party of Canada Policy Declaration]</ref> The [[New Democratic Party]] has officially stated it is willing to "explore" the issue, but in practice the party is not actively pro-republic and largely supports the status quo. Unlike other Commonwealth Realms, Canada has never had a head of government who has been openly republican.  Some politicians, having pledged allegiance to the Queen, have occasionally publicly voiced their opinion on the matter, following former-[[Deputy Prime Minister of Canada|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[John Manley (politician)|John Manley]]'s 2002 statement that he was in favour of abolishing the monarchy - later stating that it was his personal opinion.

Canada has two special-interest groups representing both sides of the debate, who frequently argue the issue in the media: [[Monarchist League of Canada]] and the [[Citizens for a Canadian Republic]].
