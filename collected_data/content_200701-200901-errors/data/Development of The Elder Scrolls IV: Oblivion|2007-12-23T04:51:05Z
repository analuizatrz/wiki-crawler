==Business==
===Rumors and official announcements===
The first rumors of another ''Elder Scrolls'' release after ''[[The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind]]'' began to circulate in June 2004, following Bethesda's posting of an e-mail searching for new staff. The new staff members were to participate on a team that would push "the bleeding-edge of RPG development for the PC and [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|future-generation consoles]]". For those considering the job, the e-mail suggested that "knowledge of&nbsp;...&nbsp;The Elder Scrolls [is] a plus". At the time, a member of Bethesda's staff played down the importance of the last comment, noting that Bethesda would "obviously" prefer applicants familiar with the company's products.<ref name="RUMORS"/> Rumors were confirmed on [[July 12]] [[2004]], when it was announced that ''[[Fallout 3]]'' and the next ''Elder Scrolls'' title would be published by Bethesda and produced by Todd Howard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bethsoft.com/news/pressrelease_071204.htm |title=Bethesda Softworks to Develop and Publish Fallout 3 |publisher=[[Bethesda Softworks]] |date=[[2004-07-12]] |accessdate=2007-12-09}}</ref> The title of the release was listed on [[September 10]] [[2004]], when Bethesda officially announced the identity of the game in question: ''The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion'', followed by a feature in the October 2004 issue of ''[[Game Informer]]''.<ref name="ANNOUNCED"/><ref name="EIVPCNG"/> At the time of the announcement, Bethesda had been working on ''Oblivion'' for two years (since 2002<ref name="EIVPCNG"/>), just as Bethesda was completing work on ''Morrowind''.<ref name="E3IMP">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/rpg/theelderscrollsivoblivion/news.html?sid=6124431 |title=The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion E3 2005 Impressions |first=Andrew |last=Park |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=[[2005-05-18]] |accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref><ref name="GBAN">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamebanshee.com/interviews/oblivion1.php |title=The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Interview |publisher=[[UGO]] |work=GameBanshee |date=[[2004-12-09]] |accessdate=2007-06-01 |quote=No rest for the weary here!}}</ref>

===Release delays===
Although preliminary reports from [[Reuters]] suggested an ''Oblivion'' release in tandem with the launch of the Xbox 360 on [[November 22]] [[2005]],<ref name="XLAUN"/> and the original announcement of the game set a release date of Winter 2005,<ref name="Announce">{{cite web|url=http://www.elderscrolls.com/news/press_051705.htm |title=Bethesda Softworks and 2K Games announce The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion for Microsoft's Xbox 360 video game and entertainment system |publisher=[[Bethesda Softworks]] |date=[[2005-05-16]] |accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref> [[Take-Two Interactive]] announced, during a conference call with analysts on [[October 31]] [[2005]], that ''Oblivion''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s release was to be delayed until the second quarter of Take-Two's fiscal year. The new schedule would put the release between February and April 2006. The delay surprised many, especially online retailers, who had begun accepting pre-orders for consoles bundled with ''Oblivion''.<ref name="RDD"/> News of the delay came at a time following a burst of bad news from the company, including a 60% drop in expected earnings per share, the ongoing [[Hot Coffee minigame controversy]], worse than average sales for the company's flagship ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'', sudden drops in share prices, and delays for other company products.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/rpg/theelderscrollsivoblivion/news.html?sid=6136197 |title=Street does double-take over Take-Two stock |last=Thorsen |first=Tor |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=[[2005-10-20]] |accessdate=2007-05-26}}<br/>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/rpg/theelderscrollsivoblivion/news.html?sid=6136974 |title=Take-Two lowers guidance, reveals new PSP GTA |last=Thorsen |first=Tor |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=[[2005-10-31]] |accessdate=2007-05-26}}<br/>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/rpg/theelderscrollsivoblivion/news.html?sid=6137016 |title=Take-Two clobbered on Wall Street |last=Thorsen |first=Tor |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=[[2005-11-01]] |accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref> 

Most commentators blamed Take-Two's corporate governance; one analyst stated that the company's troubles were more "company-specific than market-driven",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/rpg/theelderscrollsivoblivion/news.html?sid=6137016 |title=Take-Two clobbered on Wall Street |last=Thorsen |first=Tor |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=[[2005-11-01]] |accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref> and another declared company CEO [[Paul Eibeler]] to be the "worst CEO of 2005", pointing to "setbacks on the rollouts of newer games" as evidence of his failure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=%7B3C3ACCDE%2DCC12%2D4D1C%2DBB71%2D0483577E5CD7%7D&archive=true&siteid=mktw&dist=ArchiveSplash&returnURL=%2Fnews%2Fstory%2Easp%3Fguid%3D%7B3C3ACCDE%2DCC12%2D4D1C%2DBB71%2D0483577E5CD7%7D%26siteid%3Dmktw%26dist%3D%26archive%3Dtrue%26param%3Darchive%26garden%3D%26minisite%3D |title=Worst CEO: Paul Eibeler of Take-Two |first=Herb |last=Greenberg |publisher=[[MarketWatch]] |date=[[2005-12-08]] |accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref> Pete Hines, Vice President of PR and Marketing for Bethesda, and [[Todd Howard]], Executive Producer for the game, gave an update about the delay on the weekend of [[November 6]] [[2005]].

In fact, they say this three times just to make sure we know how hard they are working....&nbsp;While it's nice to see the development team taking time out to update the fans, if the announcements continue to be as vague as this one, I'd rather just see them spend the extra time on the actual game."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2005/11/06/oblivion-update-on-bethesda-forums/ |title=Oblivion update on Bethesda forums |publisher=[[Joystiq]] |date=[[2005-11-06]] |first=Alan |last=Rose |accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref>

===Product showings===
[[Image:Dsc00708.JPG|The [[Los Angeles Convention Center]], where the [[E3|Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3) is held.|right|thumb]]
On [[May 16]] [[2005]], Bethesda announced that they would be releasing ''Oblivion'' on [[Microsoft]]'s Xbox 360, and that the game's public debut would come at the [[E3|Electronic Entertainment Expo]] in [[Los Angeles]] on [[May 18]] [[2005]].<ref name="Announce"/> The version shown at E3 was substantially finished; most content was already in the game, lacking only the polish that the final months of development would bring. The game's world, for example, had already been fully constructed but still needed to undergo a "clutter pass", wherein minor game items&mdash;"books, weapons, and thousands of forks and plates"&mdash;are dropped into the game world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/rpg/theelderscrollsivoblivion/news.html?sid=6124431 |title=The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Q&A - Oblivion at E3 2005 |author=Staff |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=[[2005-05-17]] |accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref> 

Howard himself never took to the show. "It's like a beauty pageant," he told one reporter.

We don't have loud crazy booths."<ref name="5MIN"/> 

During Microsoft's E3 pre-show conference, a ten-second preview of ''Oblivion'' was shown amid demo reels for other games. The preview consisted of a series of brief second-long shots of the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/rpg/theelderscrollsivoblivion/news.html?sid=6125085 |title=Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion E3 2005 Preshow Report |first=Matthew |last=Rorie |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=[[2005-05-17]] |accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref> Later on, during E3 proper, Bethesda showed a longer 25-minute demo that showcased further clipped scenes: the opening dungeon, a procedurally rendered forest, one of the game's towns, and other locales.<ref name="E3IMP"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=Articles.Detail&id=2 |title=E3 2005 Coverage: Demo Summary |author=Stargelman |publisher=[[GameSpy]] |accessdate=2007-05-27 |date=[[2005-05-19]]}}</ref> Most viewers were impressed by ''Oblivion''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s showing.

===PlayStation 3 release===
The PS3 version of the game was ported/developed by [[4J Studios]] who have worked with bethesda in other projects. In April 2006, an inadvertently mailed version of Bethesda's supposed forthcoming game release list began a series of unconfirmed rumors of ''Oblivion'' releases for the [[PlayStation 3]] and the [[PlayStation Portable]] (PSP). The list suggested that ''Oblivion'' would be a PlayStation 3 [[launch title]], and that the PSP version would be released in November.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=9035 |title=Report: Oblivion To Debut On PS3, PSP |first=Simon |last=Carless |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |date=[[2006-04-25]]|accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref> These rumors were confirmed on [[September 28]] [[2006]], when Bethesda officially announced the titles, setting the PlayStation 3 version's North American release date for November 2006, European release date for March 2006, and the PSP version for Spring 2007. The two titles were set to be published by Bethesda alone in North America, and with [[Ubisoft]] as a co-publisher in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elderscrolls.com/news/press_092806.htm |title=Bethesda Softworks Announces Oblivion™ for PLAYSTATION®3 and PSP®System |publisher=[[Bethesda Softworks]] |date=[[2006-09-28]] |accessdate=2007-08-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=11048 |title=Oblivion Confirmed For PS3 Launch, PSP in Spring |first=Jason |last=Dobson |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |date=[[2006-09-28]] |accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref> Hines was mum regarding the change in publishers: "Too much backroom stuff."<ref name="SCRUP"/> Ubisoft saw their first quarter sales for 2007 rise 90.5%, to 134 million [[Euro]]s, exceeding previous forecasts by 14 million Euros. Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot attributed the rise to "new-generation consoles and the impact of PlayStation 3 game sales, including ''[[Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas|Rainbow Six Vegas]]'' and ''Oblivion''".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=27013 |title=Ubisoft first quarter sales up 90.5 per cent |first=Mark |last=Androvich |date=[[2007-07-24]] |publisher=GamesIndustry.biz |accessdate=2007-08-03}}</ref>

Despite the title being included in Sony's announced PlayStation 3 launch lineup at its annual Gamers' Day event in San Francisco, online retailers [[Electronics Boutique|EBgames.com]] and [[GameStop|Gamestop.com]]&mdash;two sites with a history of revealing the release dates of games before their publisher's announcements&mdash;were found on [[November 8]] [[2006]] to have set ''Oblivion''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s release date as [[January 1]] [[2007]].<ref name="RRDR"/> Some few hours later, the delay was confirmed, as Pete Hines issued the statement that "Oblivion PS3 is now a Q1 2007 title". Hines gave no reason for the delay, but the news stirred suspicions of development difficulties working with the PlayStation 3, and that Bethesda was discouraged by the scarcity of PlayStation 3 consoles at launch.<ref name="Q12K7"/> The North American PS3 release was later confirmed to be [[March 20]] [[2007]], near the end of the first quarter window,<ref name="PS3NA"/> with the European PS3 release set at [[April 27]] [[2007]].<ref name="PS3EURO"/> Some reporters commented on a perceived parallelism between the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 delays and releases.<ref name="EMBRACE"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2006/11/09/oblivion-slips-from-ps3-launch-expansion-for-pc-360-late-nov/ |title=Oblivion slips from PS3 launch, expansion for PC, 360 late Nov |first=James |last=Ransom-Wiley |date=[[2006-09-11]] |publisher=[[Joystiq]] |accessdate=2007-08-31}}</ref>

[[United Kingdom]] video games retailer [[GAME (retailer)|GAME]] encountered distribution problems on release day in Europe. A branch on [[Oxford Street]] reported to ''[[Computer and Video Games (magazine)|Computer and Video Games]]'' (CVG), a video games magazine, that no units were in stock on the afternoon of [[April 27]] [[2007]], and that other stores were in the same predicament.<ref name="GAMEOBB">{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=162989 |title=GAME says Oblivion PS3 on its way |first=Stuart |last=Bishop |publisher=[[Computer and Video Games (magazine)|Computer and Video Games]] |date=[[2007-04-27]] |accessdate=2007-08-03}}</ref> Other reports suggested that the game was not available in any of GAME's 400 UK and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] stores.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=24619 |title=GAME refuses to stock Oblivion for PS3 |first=Matt |last=Martin |date=[[2007-04-27]] |accessdate=2007-08-03}}</ref> GAME staff nonetheless told ''CVG'' reporters that copies would be available by next week, "possibly Monday". An Ubisoft representative attributed the shortage to high demand for the product, and stated that copies were available online and at other [[High Street]] retailers. Other retailers, such as [[HMV]] and [[Virgin Megastore]], reported no shortages.<ref name="GAMEOBB"/>

==Production and design==
===Staff===
In 2002, Bethesda's ''Elder Scrolls'' team was split in two: half, mostly [[Game designer|designer]]s and [[Game artist|artist]]s, were sent to work on ''Morrowind''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind#Expansions|expansions]]; and the rest, mostly [[Game programmer|programmer]]s, were sent to work on technology for ''Oblivion''.<ref name="RPGNG"/> Ken Rolston, a former designer for ''Morrowind'', was signed on as the game's Lead Designer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6166140.htm |title=Big Huge Games grabs big huge game designer |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |first=Tim |last=Surette |date=[[2007-02-20]] |accessdate=2007-12-09}}</ref> Coders for the PC and Xbox 360 were somewhat interchangeable, owing to the similarity in system architecture between the consoles,<ref name="SCRUP"/> but the team still had to divide its programming staff between the two.<ref name="GPRDCR"/> A number of staff with experience in developing for [[Sony]] platforms like the [[PlayStation 2]] worked on optimizing the code for the subsequent [[PlayStation 3]] release.<ref name="SCRUP">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=23597 |title=Scrolling Up |first=Ellie |last=Gibson |publisher=[[Eurogamer#GamesIndustry.biz|GamesIndustry.biz]] |date=[[2007-03-20]] |accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref> The art and design staff were largely unaffected by the need to develop for multiple consoles.<ref name="GPRDCR"/>

===Publisher relations===
On [[February 3]] [[2005]], Bethesda entered into an agreement with [[Take-Two Interactive]] regarding the publication and release of ''Oblivion''. Under the agreement, Bethesda would retain full control over ''Oblivion''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s development and the rights to any possible sequels, and Take-Two would agree to publish the game under its recently-formed [[2K Games]] sub brand.<ref name="COPUB"/> According to Producer Gavin Carter, the team's experience was a rarity in the industry; few independent developer-publisher relationships still exist, and it was a surprise that Bethesda's experience worked out as well as it did. Carter described Take-Two's role as one of minimal interference, and the company mostly left Bethesda's development teams alone, trusting them to produce a "fantastic product" with minimal interference or "red tape". The relationship was a rarity in the industry, according to Carter, where most developers are beholden to their publishers.<ref name="GPRDCR"/>  Ashley Cheng, ''Oblivion''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s senior producer, concurred. There was "complete freedom" at Bethesda to decide their own path, whatever market trends might say.<ref name="ASHCHN"/> Of the legal proceedings affecting Bethesda's parent company ZeniMax during the initial stages of game development, when Bethesda founder Christopher Weaver sued the company for severance pay,<ref name="DIR"/><ref>{{cite court|url=http://www.courts.state.md.us/opinions/cosa/2007/2368s05.pdf |litigants=Christopher S.

"I just focus on the games."<ref name="DIR"/>

===Design goals===
[[Image:Ssmartinwallpaperiw8.png|[[Martin Septim]], the "chosen one" of ''Oblivion''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s main quest, was not the [[player character]], but a [[non-player character]].|thumb|right]]
The team's goal then was, in the words of Todd Howard, to "create the quintessential RPG of the next generation", with a focus on a "combination of freeform gameplay and cutting-edge graphics."<ref name="GSPTQA">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/theelderscrollsivoblivion/news.html?page=1&sid=6111720 |title=The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Q&A - Overview, Character Development, Fallout |author=Staff |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=[[2004-10-28]] |accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref> It was a wise decision to make at the time. Producing for next generation machines, rather than a cheap upgrade, gave Bethesda an additional four years of development: four years that "all but guaranteed" a punctual launch alongside the Xbox 360, four years that offered room for Bethesda to start from scratch.<ref name="DIR">{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/issue/83/11 |title=Bethesda: The Right Direction |publisher=[[The Escapist]] |first=Joe |last=Blancato |date=[[2007-02-06]] |accessdate=2007-06-01}}</ref> Howard describes this as an aspect of Bethesda's greater goal of "Reinvention", where the team's goal is to make "a new game that stands on its own, that has its own identity".<ref name="RPGNG"/> Howard spoke of the need to avoid repetition, to avoid merely adding "some new features and content, and keep doing that", describing that path as "a good way to drive your games into the ground." Bethesda, Howard stated, would focus instead on recapturing what made its past titles exciting "in the first place".<ref name="DIR"/>

Keeping with the spirit of past games, Howard promised to keep with the spirit of "big-world, do-anything"-style games, feeling that a certain size and number of choices were needed to make role-playing feel "meaningful";<ref name="GSPTQA"/> but now there was to be greater emphasis on keeping the game focused.<ref name="RPGNG"/> Pete Hines saw the developments between games as less an issue of design focus and more as a "natural side effect of improving and refining how the game works". If smart decisions were made, ease of play would naturally follow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/extras/2006/022406_oblivion_1.x |title=The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Preview |first=Chris |last=Remo |publisher=[[Shacknews]] |date=[[2006-02-24]] |accessdate=2007-05-27}}</ref> ''Oblivion'' would include fewer NPCs and quests than ''Morrowind'', and mindless filler, which Howard felt the team had been guilty of in the past, would be avoided.<ref name="RPGNG"/> In exchange, Producer Gavin Carter later explained, there would be greater focus on length and depth in the quests, adding more "alternate paths", more "chararcters [sic] to connect with, who actually have personalities". Carter cast negative aspersions on aspects of gameplay too far removed from the game's central plot. Carter stated that such material was not needed, preferring instead that the focus be on the plot, on "fighting these demon lords", and that further material is "tertiary" and "takes away".<ref name="GCRT"/> 

The role of the player character in the main quest was to be changed as well. In contrast to past games, where the player character would play a type of "[[The One#See also|chosen one]]", ''Oblivion'' would have the player character "find him, protect him, and help him."<ref name="GCLOUD"/><ref name="MYGAME"/> Aside from that, in the opinion of Hines, "the main quest has similar themes and tones as in past Elder Scrolls games", and should still feel "epic", simply because of the way the gamespace is designed: with openness in mind.<ref name="MYGAME">{{cite web|url=http://www.mygamer.com/index.php?page=interviews&mode=viewinterviews&id=35 |title=The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion - An interview with Pete Hines |first=Matt |last=Cook |publisher=Mygamer |date=[[2005-10-20]] |accessdate=2007-06-02}}</ref> Improving that aspect of the experience, said Hines, came mostly in the form of improved information presentation. The system would not intrude on the experience when the player merely wishes to "walk around and explore the world and do whatever he/she wants", but given the scenario where the player asks "'OK, I'm ready to do the next part of the main quest, where do I go?'", the game would provide a ready answer, so as to avoid "confusion" and "downtime".<ref name="GCLOUD"/>

===Technology===
The Xbox 360 was set as ''Oblivion''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s base platform, being the "easiest to develop for", in the words of Pete Hines; the PC, being more like a "random amalgamation of graphics cards and RAM and processors", and poorly "defined".<ref name="SCRUP"/> As they had done with previous games in the series, Bethesda threw out their old content and technology and began work anew. A new engine was envisioned, one which would take advantage of advanced lighting and shader routines, like [[high dynamic range rendering]] and [[Specularity|specular mapping]].<ref name="E3IMP"/> The final product was shipped with an engine formed of a mixture of in-house tech and Numerical Design Limited's [[Gamebryo]] engine,<ref name="ELB"/> "tricked out" in collaboration with Bethesda's graphics programmers and NDL.<ref name="TVG"/> Cheng has described the game as "[[pixel shader|pixel-shader]] heavy", taking advantage of the feature in rendering "metal, wood, stone, blood, skin," in addition to water, which was the only use ''Morrowind'' made of the technology. In particular, ''Oblivion'' uses [[Normal mapping|normal maps]], diffuse maps, specular maps, and [[Parallax mapping|parallax maps]],<ref name="MONTHLY"/> which Howard described as "kind of like [[displacement mapping]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xbox.ign.com/articles/568/568240p1.html |title=The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=[[2004-11-22]] |first=Steve |last=Butts |accessdate=2007-06-03}}</ref> ''Oblivion'' makes use of Radiant AI, a new artificial intelligence system that allows non-player characters to dynamically react and interact with the world around them.<ref name="GCHRON"/> General goals, such as "Eat at this city at 2pm" are given to NPCs, and NPCs are left to determine how to achieve them.<ref name="GNEXT"/> The absence of individual scripting for each character allowed for the construction of a world on a much larger scale than other games had developed, and aided in the creation of what Todd Howard described as an "organic feel" for the game.<ref name="GCHRON"/>

Features introduced for the new release that had been absent in ''Morrowind'' included "full facial animations, lip synching, and full speech for all dialogue".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/theelderscrollsivoblivion/news.html?sid=6111161 |title=New details on Elder Scrolls IV |first=Chris |last=Kohler |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=[[2004-10-22]] |accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref> ''Oblivion'' uses [[Havok (software)|Havok]] as its physics engine, following in the footsteps of ''[[Half-Life 2]]''. Havok is involved in modeling the game's representations of [[telekinesis]], theft, traps, tumbling,<ref name="LIVING"/> paralysis, [[area effect]] fireball explosions,<ref name="MONTHLY"/> and the contact between arrows and their targets. Arrows, in ''Oblivion'', may lodge themselves in objects and thereby increase their mass.<ref name="LIVING"/>

The inclusion of procedural content tools allowed for the creation of realistic environments at much faster rates than was the case with ''Morrowind''.<ref name="RPGCRT"/> Using [[Interactive Data Visualization, Inc.|IDV]]’s [[SpeedTree]] technology, for example, Bethesda artists were able to "quickly generate complex and organic tree shapes with relative ease". With its "parent/child [[Hierarchy|hierarchies]] and [[Iteration|iterative]] [[Branching (software)|branch]] levels comprised of highly modifiable cylinder [[Geometric primitive|primitives]]", Bethesda's Noah Berry attests that "an entire tree shape can be created in a manner of minutes, just by adjusting numerical values and tweaking [[Spline (mathematics)|spline]] curve handles".<ref name="NOAH"/> Instead of ''Morrowind''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s artificially smoothed-over terrain, erosion algorithms incorporated in the landscape generation tools allowed for the creation of "craggy mountain vistas" quickly and easily.<ref name="RPGCRT"/>

===PlayStation 3===
The PS3 release featured a number of technical improvements over the Xbox 360 release; load times were reduced, fewer framerate drops were experienced and several bugs were fixed. Draw distance was increased, and new shaders were included to render the foreground cleanly and sharply, leading to rocky landscapes with "craggy appearances" rather than "smooth, non-distinct surfaces".<ref name="HANDSONHANDSOFF"/> The new shader sets blended "near detail" and "far detail" onscreen, removing the harsh line that cut between them in previous releases.<ref name="PS3INT"/> Bethesda decided against implementing [[SIXAXIS]] motion support for the game, considering ''Oblivion'' not to be of a type well-suited to such a feature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/765/765378p1.html |title=Bethesda Enters PS3 Oblivion |publisher=[[IGN]] |first=Rob |last=Burman |date=[[2007-02-16]] |accessdate=2007-08-03}}</ref> The ''Knights of the Nine'' content pack was included with the game, but other downloadable content releases were not.<ref name="HANDSONHANDSOFF"/> The latter release spawned a host of rumors across the Internet:<ref name="RUMORS"/> a 1UP piece stated that the content was removed due to its negative effect on console performance,<ref name="DOWNGRADE">{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2007/02/10/oblivion-downgraded-for-ps3-not-happening-on-wii/ |title=Oblivion: Downgraded for PS3, not happening on Wii [update 1] |first=Jared |last=Rea |publisher=[[Joystiq]] |date=[[2007-02-10]] |accessdate=2007-08-03}}</ref> and other websites repeated the claim.<ref name="RUMORS"/> Limitations of the PS3's system memory were suspect, as the potential cause of the performance drop.<ref name="DOWNGRADE"/>

In an article for IGN, Pete Hines challenged the statements, providing an alternate rationale for the content packages' absence. Firstly, he stated, the expansions were removed to avoid giving a PS3 player an early advantage over other consoles' players. Secondly, he stated, the game designers were unfamiliar with the [[PlayStation Network#PlayStation Store|PlayStation Network Store]] and Sony's online content distribution systems, and had not yet determined the best method of releasing the packages. The suggestion that the PS3's technical makeup determined the move could not be "farther from the truth". Hines confirmed that the shader improvements for the PS3 would eventually migrate to the PC and Xbox 360 through further patches, but noted that some optimizations would remain exclusive to the PS3.<ref name="RUMORS"/> In the end, the Xbox 360 and the PS3 would be "very much on a par" in their graphical performance.<ref name="SCRUP"/>

[[Image:OblivionMobileScreenshot.gif|thumb|right]]
''The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion Mobile'' is a mobile phone [[Computer role-playing game|role-playing game]] developed and published by [[Vir2l Studios]]. It was released [[May 2]] [[2006]] It is an adaptation of ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'', and as such it is set within Cyrodiil, the main province of [[Tamriel]].  It also features several monsters and dungeons from ''Oblivion''.  Players are free to choose out of the classes of Monk, Nightblade, Barbarian, Archer, Knight, Spellsword, Sorcerer and Battlemage. Some of the classes are found in earlier installments of the [[The Elder Scrolls|''Elder Scrolls'' series]].  Unlike Oblivion, however, the player gains [[experience points]] to increase their level, instead of using their major skills.

From April 2006 onwards, Bethesda began releasing small, downloadable packages of content from their website and over the [[Xbox Live Marketplace]], for prices equivalent to between one and three [[United States dollar|US dollar]]s.<ref name="downloads">{{cite web|url=http://www.obliviondownloads.com/StoreCatalog_ProductList.aspx?SubCategoryId=1 |title=Oblivion Downloads |publisher=[[Bethesda Softworks]] |accessdate=2006-12-20}}</ref> The first package, a set of horse armour for ''Oblivion''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s steeds, was released on [[April 3]] [[2006]], costing 200 [[Microsoft Points|Marketplace points]], equivalent to [[United States dollar|US$]]2.50<ref name="HRSRMR"/> or [[Pound sterling|GBP]]1.50;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=15909 |title=Bethesda announces new premium Oblivion content |first=Paul |last=Loughrey |publisher=[[Eurogamer#GamesIndustry.biz|GamesIndustry.biz]] |date=[[2006-04-05]] |accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref> the corresponding PC release cost was [[United States dollar|US$]]1.99.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/theelderscrollsivoblivion/news.html?sid=6147320 |title=Next Oblivion add-on priced |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=[[2006-04-07]] |first=Brendan |last=Sinclair |accessdate=2007-07-06}}</ref> Bethesda offered no rationale for the price discrepancy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3149261&a=all |title=Oblivion 360 Downloads Begin |publisher=[[1UP]] |date=[[2006-04-03]] |first=Patrick |last=Klepek |accessdate=2007-07-06}}</ref> These were not the first ''Oblivion''-related Marketplace releases, (that honor goes to a series of dashboard themes and picture packs released prior to ''Oblivion''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s publication, in February 2006, for a nominal fee<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/rpg/theelderscrollsivoblivion/news.html?sid=6144822 |title=Oblivion content now on Marketplace |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=[[2006-02-23]] |first=Tim |last=Surette |accessdate=2007-07-06}}</ref>) nor were they entirely unexpected: Bethesda had previously announced their desire to support the Xbox release with downloadable Marketplace content,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=8784 |title=Round Up: Oblivion Downloadable Content, ESRB Ratings Issues, Ubisoft COO Resigns |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |date=[[2006-04-03]] |first=Jason |last=Dobson |accessdate=2007-07-06}}</ref> and other publishers had already began to release similar packages for their games, at similar prices. A November 2005-release of a "Winter Warrior Pack" for ''[[Kameo: Elements of Power]]'' was also priced at 200 Marketplace points,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6140529.html |title=Kameo konkokts kool kostumes |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=[[2005-11-29]] |first=Tim |last=Surette |accessdate=2007-07-06}}</ref> and similar content additions had been scheduled for ''[[Project Gotham Racing 3]]'' and ''[[Perfect Dark Zero]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/perfectdarkzero/news.html?page=1&sid=6146324 |title=Marketplace hits 10 million transactions |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=[[2006-03-21]] |first=Tim |last=Surette |accessdate=2007-07-06}}</ref> Indeed, Marketplace content additions formed a significant part of a March 2006 Microsoft announcement regarding the future of [[Xbox Live]]. "Downloadable in-game content is a main focus of Microsoft's strategy heading into the next-gen console war," stated one [[GameSpot]] reporter.<ref name="HRSRMR"/> "With more consoles on their way to retail, 80 games available by June, and new content and experiences coming to Xbox Live all the time, there has never been a better time to own an Xbox 360," announced [[Peter Moore (business)|Peter Moore]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=8606 |title=Microsoft Confirms Xbox 360 Production Surge, Plans |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |date=[[2006-03-21]] |first=Simon |last=Carless |accessdate=2007-07-06}}</ref> Nonetheless, although [[Xbox Live Arcade]] games, picture packs, [[Xbox 360#Dashboard|dashboard]]s and profile themes continued to be a Marketplace success for Microsoft, the aforementioned in-game content remained sparse.<ref name="HRSRMR"/> Pete Hines asserted, 
"We were the first ones to do downloadable content like that—some people had done similar things, but no one had really done additions where you add new stuff to your existing game." There was no pressure from Microsoft to make the move.<ref name="SCRUP"/>

===Consumer backlash===
Although gamers generally displayed some enthusiasm for the concept of [[micropayment]]s for downloadable in-game content,<ref name="BRTOI"/><ref name="HRSRMR"/> ''Oblivion''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s horse armor release caused significant discord on [[Internet forum]]s, with gamers divided by the item's value versus its cost. "This is not a matter of it being expensive in the grand scheme of things. This is not a matter of it being a requirement to buy. It's a matter of basically spitting in the consumer's collective face," wrote one poster. "Something like horse armor is a trivial addition to the game&nbsp;...&nbsp;Bethesda should be ashamed of it." Others were more conciliatory. "I agree that small stuff like that SHOULD be free, but in this day and age it's unlikely that we'll get a lot of 'free' content. If you are into the game as much as I am, you're going to shell out the $ for downloads. Microsoft knows this&nbsp;...&nbsp;so the best we can hope for is that it will be free (unlikely) or inexpensive (as is the case here)," wrote another.<ref name="HRSRMR"/> A [[Joystiq]] editorial gave further complaints. "C'mon, if this download came with a side quest, then sure, we'd throw down some points. But, despite our ever-growing addiction to ''Oblivion'', we're not itching to hand over additional cash for an item that was supposed to be included in the game's initial release."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2006/04/03/download-oblivions-horse-armor-for-a-price/ |title=Download Oblivion's horse armor, for a price |publisher=[[Joystiq]] |date=[[2006-04-03]] |first=James |last=Ransom-Wiley |accessdate=2007-07-06}}</ref> ''Kameo''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s release hadn't provoked such a backlash; but then, there had not been such "feverish enthusiasm" for ''Kameo'' as there was for ''Oblivion''.<ref name="BRTOI"/>

On April 4, the day after the first content release, Bethesda representatives, and Pete Hines in particular, made a variety of similar responses to various inquiries regarding the mod; broadly similar responses were issued to GameSpot News, to Evil Avatar, and to 1UP. Regarding the cost of the add-on, Hines stated that Bethesda aimed for a price point that "fit". "A Theme costs 150 points. The ''Kameo'' thing was 200. We're trying to find the right spot that fits&nbsp;...&nbsp;"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2006/04/04/bethesda-responds-to-oblivion-backlash/ |title=Bethesda responds to Oblivion backlash |publisher=[[Joystiq]] |date=[[2006-04-04]] |first=James |last=Ransom-Wiley |accessdate=2007-07-06}}</ref> Hines assured the press  that Bethesda wasn't going to respond rashly to customer criticism. "We're not going to make any knee-jerk decisions based on it [the armor] being available for five hours. We'll see what folks think and put out a few others we have planned and figure out where to go from there." Responding to concerns as to why ''Oblivion''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s downloadable content would cost money, while ''Morrowind''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s had been free, Hines stated: "Different game, different approach to downloadable content and the size and scope of things we want to do, and what it takes to do them."<ref name="BRTOI"/> Hines was skeptical that consumers would have been happy with the product at any price: "We could have put that out for 25 cents and people would have still been up in arms."<ref name="BRTOI"/> A Bethesda representative told GameSpot that future plans were still somewhat uncertain. "It's hard to tell right now until we have more stuff out, how many people want item plug-ins, versus quests or locations, and so forth. It certainly may be the case that some plug-ins will appeal to some folks and not others, but we hope we'll be able to provide a good variety so that there's something for everyone&nbsp;...&nbsp;and hopefully more than one something for everyone."<ref name="MOCC">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/rpg/theelderscrollsivoblivion/news.html?sid=6147118 |title=More Oblivion content coming, detailed |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=[[2006-04-04]] |first=Tim |last=Surette |accessdate=2007-07-06}}</ref>

===Later releases===
April 4 also saw the announcement of two new downloadable content packs for the coming weeks: an "Orrery" quest that would see gamers setting out to repair a Dwarven Orrery; and a "Wizard's Tower" that would offer a new home for player characters, complete with the capacity to grow herbs, summon atronachs, and make spells.<ref name="MOCC"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2006/04/05/next-oblivion-downloads-promise-more-than-horse-getups/ |title=Next Oblivion downloads promise more than horse getups |date=[[2006-04-05]] |publisher=[[Joystiq]] |first=James |last=Ransom-Wiley |accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref> 1UP predicted that, given Bethesda's response to customer criticism, those releases would be somewhat more substantial than the "Horse Armor" release was.<ref name="BRTOI"/> On April 7, Bethesda priced the "Orrery". Offering what GameSpot called "more bang for less buck", Bethesda set the PC release price at [[United States dollar|US$]]1.89, and the Xbox 360 release price at 150 Marketplace points, equivalent to [[United States dollar|US$]]1.88.<ref name="NOBAOP"/> Joystiq offered their support—"'Big ups'"—to the company for the new price. "Although we passed on the $2.50 horse armor this week, we'll definitely be messin' with that Orrery device when it hits the Marketplace."<ref name="LCOFCD"/> The pack was eventually released on April 17.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2006/04/17/oblivion-orrey-pack-now-available-on-xbox-live/ |title=Oblivion Orrery pack now available on Xbox Live [Update] |publisher=[[Joystiq]] |date=[[2006-04-17]] |first=Ross |last=Miller |accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref> Also on April 7, [[EB Games]] and [[GameStop]] began offering a coupon promising one free download of the "Horse Armor" pack with every purchase of the PC edition of ''Oblivion''; Xbox 360 owners were once again out of luck.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2006/04/07/free-oblivion-horse-armor-coupon-with-pc-version/ |title=Free Oblivion horse armor coupon |publisher=[[Joystiq]] |first=Christopher |last=Grant |accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref> The "Wizard's Tower", called the "Frostcrag Spire" in-game, was released on April 24 for the same price as the "Orrery".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/theelderscrollsivoblivion/news.html?sid=6148244 |title=Wizard's Tower add-on available for Oblivion |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=[[2006-04-24]] |first=Brendan |last=Sinclair |accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref>

New releases continued into late 2006. The "Thieves' Den", a 2.27MB download offering the chance to "Uncover a famous pirate's lost ship and claim it for your own", was released on May 22 for the Xbox 360, priced at 150 Marketplace points, "roughly" equivalent to [[United States dollar|US$]] $1.89.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6151636.html |title=Den of Xbox 360 Oblivion thieves uncovered |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=[[2006-05-22]] |first=Tor |last=Thorsen |accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref> Explaining the add-on, Ashley Cheng stated "Basically, it's [[The Goonies|Goonies]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2006/05/17/new-oblivion-add-on-inspired-by-goonies/ |title=New Oblivion add-on inspired by Goonies |publisher=[[Joystiq]] |date=[[2006-05-17]] |first=James |last=Ransom-Wiley |accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref> "Mehrunes' Razor", a quest revolving around a mage in search of the deadly Daedric artifact known as Mehrunes' Razor, was released on June 14. It became the most expensive download yet, at [[United States dollar|US$]]2.99 for PC users and 250 Marketplace points, equivalent to [[United States dollar|US$]]$3.13, for Xbox 360 owners.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/theelderscrollsivoblivion/news.html?sid=6152158 |title=Next Oblivion add-on detailed |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=[[2006-06-01]] |first=Brendan |last=Sinclair |accessdate=2007-07-09}}<br/>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/theelderscrollsivoblivion/news.html?sid=6152676 |title=Oblivion Mehrunes' Razor add-on dated |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=[[2006-06-13]] |first=Brendan |last=Sinclair |accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref> One [[1UP]] reporter took the occasion to reflect on the increasing price of owning the "complete" ''Oblivion''. With all the add-ons included, he calculated, "That's over $80 in game for the complete version of Oblivion, thus far." Foreseeing eventual problems with the upcoming [[PS3]] release, and a potential bundling of all the software for a cheaper price, he wondered: "will Xbox 360 and PC users feel slighted?&nbsp;...&nbsp;Microtransactions are sticky business."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3151156 |title=Yes, Even More Oblivion Content Coming |publisher=[[1UP]] |date=[[2006-06-01]] |first=Luke |last=Smith |accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref> Joystiq continued to harp on the "Horse Armor" add-on in their notice of the quest's release. "With a weapon like that, who needs horse armor?"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2006/06/16/new-oblivion-plug-in-available/ |title=New Oblivion plug-in available |publisher=[[Joystiq]] |date=[[2006-06-16]] |first=Alan |last=Rose |accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref> On July 13, "The Vile Lair", sporting a hidden crypt called "Deepscorn Hollow" for players bitten with ''Oblivion''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s vampirism bug, was released. Like the "Orrery" and the "Wizard's Tower", Bethesda set "The Vile Lair"'s PC release price at [[United States dollar|US$]]1.89, and the Xbox 360 release price at 150 Marketplace points, equivalent to [[United States dollar|US$]]1.88.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/rpg/theelderscrollsivoblivion/news.html?sid=6163580 |title=Oblivion getting $2 evil add-on July 13 |date=[[2006-07-11]] |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |first=Tor |last=Thorsen |accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref> Joystiq responded positively to the new price point. "What a bargain!&nbsp;...&nbsp;It's good to see the folks at ''Oblivion'' have learned their lesson and aren't offering relatively super expensive content not fit to see the light of day."<ref name="NOBDOWN"/> On August 31, "Spell Tomes", adding books with "wondrous and powerful magic spells," to the random loot of fallen foes, was released, for the price of [[United States dollar|US$]]1.00 on both the Xbox 360 and the PC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/rpg/theelderscrollsivoblivion/news.html?sid=6156923 |title=New $1 Oblivion DL casts spells |date=[[2006-08-31]] |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |first=Tim |last=Surette |accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref> Beginning on December 22 and continuing on until the end of the year, Bethesda offered their "Mehrunes Razor" package free of charge, as a sort of holiday gift.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/rpg/theelderscrollsivoblivion/news.html?sid=6163580 |title=Bethesda giftwraps Oblivion's Mehrunes Razor |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=[[2006-12-21]] |first=Tim |last=Surette}}</ref> ''Oblivion''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s final content pack, named "Fighter's Stronghold", was released [[October 15]] [[2007]].
