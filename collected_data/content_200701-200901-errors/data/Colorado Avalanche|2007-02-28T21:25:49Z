The '''Colorado Avalanche''' are a professional [[ice hockey]] team based in [[Denver, Colorado]] [[United States]]. They play in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL). They are highly notable for being the only team in NHL history to win the Stanley Cup their first season. Although it was not their first season as an organization, it was their first season in Denver.

==Franchise history==
{{see also|Quebec Nordiques}}
The Quebec Nordiques were one of the [[World Hockey Association]]'s original teams when the league began play in [[1972-73 WHA season|1972]]. Though first awarded to a group in [[San Francisco]], the team quickly moved to [[Quebec City]] when the [[California]] deal soured due to financial and arena problems. During their seven WHA seasons, the Nordiques won the [[Avco World Trophy]] once, in [[1976-77 WHA season|1977]]. Two years later, in [[1979-80 NHL season|1979]], they entered the NHL, along with the WHA's [[Edmonton Oilers]], [[Hartford Whalers]], and [[Winnipeg Jets]].

After making the postseason for seven consecutive years, [[1980-81 NHL season|1981]] to [[1986-87 NHL season|1987]], the Nordiques fell into the league's basement. In [[1991 NHL Entry Draft|1991]], for the third straight draft, Quebec had the first overall selection. Although [[Eric Lindros]], the draft's top-ranked player, repeatedly said he would never play in [[Quebec City]] they drafted him anyway. "The Big E" would not wear the Nordiques jersey when it was presented to him, only holding it for press photographs. On advice from his mother, Lindros refused to sign a contract and began a holdout that would last over a year. On June 30, 1992, he was traded to the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] in exchange for five players, the rights to Swedish prospect [[Peter Forsberg]], two first-round draft picks, and $15 million (USD). Quickly, Quebec would become a [[Stanley Cup]] contender. The Lindros trade is now seen by many to be one of the most one-sided in sports history due to Lindros' injuries and falling out with the Flyers eight years later, as well as the success enjoyed by the Quebec/Colorado franchise for the next decade.

While the team experienced on-ice success, off-ice financial failure during the lockout-shortened [[1994-95 NHL season]] forced team owner [[Marcel Aubut]] to ask for a bailout from Quebec's provincial government. The bailout fell through and Aubut subsequently sold the team to a group of investors in [[Denver]]. The franchise moved to [[Colorado]] following the 1995 season, where they were renamed the Colorado Avalanche.

[[Image:Patrick_Roy_1999.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Goaltender [[Patrick Roy]], the winningest net minder in the NHL, played for the Avalanche from 1995-2003.]]
Led by [[Captain (ice hockey)|captain]] [[Joe Sakic]], Forsberg and [[Defenceman (ice hockey)|defensive]] stalwart [[Adam Foote]], Colorado entered their first season in Denver with a very strong lineup. Still, few could anticipate the midseason trade that would make them a true power. On [[December 2]], [[1995-96 NHL season|1995]], during an 11-1 loss to the [[Detroit Red Wings]], [[Montreal Canadiens]] coach [[Mario Tremblay]] kept [[goaltender]] [[Patrick Roy]] in net for the first nine goals. After finally being pulled from the game, Roy told team president [[Ronald Corey]] it was the last game he would ever play for the Canadiens. Four days later, Roy was traded to Colorado along with [[Mike Keane]] for [[Andrei Kovalenko]], [[Martin Rucinsky]], and [[Jocelyn Thibault]], who had been chosen with one of the first-rounders acquired in the Lindros deal. When the Avs and Habs played each other a few weeks later, Roy won 5-2 in a Colorado uniform. He added a final insult by flipping the puck at Tremblay when the game ended, and claimed,

''<blockquote>"It made me feel so good. It was a mistake, but I don't regret it. I'm an emotional person. I know it sometimes gets me in trouble, but I know it sometimes helps me to play better too."</blockquote>{{Fact|date=February 2007}}''

Ironically, Roy was a [[Quebec City]] native who had allegedly vowed not to play for the Nordiques (but he would play for the Avalanche). In the 1996 playoffs, it didn't matter that [[Montreal]] lost in the quarterfinals, because behind strong goaltending from Roy and a [[Conn Smythe Trophy]]-winning performance from Sakic, after beating the [[Detroit Red Wings]] in a classic six-game series in the Western Conference Final, the Avs would roll to the [[Stanley Cup]] Final to meet the [[Florida Panthers]]. In the third [[overtime (ice hockey)|overtime]] of game four, defenseman [[Uwe Krupp]] scored to claim the franchise's first Cup. Roy's promise to his teammates: "No more [[rat]]s" (Florida right-winger [[Scott Mellanby]] had popularized the throwing of [[plastic]] rats earlier that season whenever the Cats scored) held true.

Colorado would lose a Western Conference Final rematch to the rival Red Wings in [[1996-97 NHL season|1997]], despite winning the coveted [[Presidents' Trophy]] for best regular-season record, and over the next three seasons, the team lost two more times in the Western Conference Finals, both times to the Dallas Stars. Then [[March 6]], [[1999-2000 NHL season|2000]], the [[Boston Bruins]] traded future [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] defenseman [[Ray Bourque]] and [[Forward (ice hockey)|forward]] [[Dave Andreychuk]] to Colorado for [[Brian Rolston]], [[Martin Grenier]], [[Samuel Pahlsson]], and a first-round draft pick. Bourque, who had been a Bruin since [[1979-80 NHL season|1979-80]], requested a trade to a contender for one last shot at a Stanley Cup. The Avs, however, would lose to the [[Dallas Stars]] in the Conference Final.

In [[2000-01 NHL season|2000-01]], the Avs would once again strengthen their defense for a run at the Cup. On February 21, 2001, they acquired star defenseman [[Rob Blake]] and defensive center [[Steven Reinprecht]] from the [[Los Angeles Kings]] for [[Adam Deadmarsh]] and [[Aaron Miller]]. Colorado would win the [[Presidents' Trophy]] again, with a 52-16-10-4, 118-point record, and looked like they would fulfill their mission &mdash; they'd dedicated 00-01 to getting Bourque a ring. They were dealt a blow, however, when [[Peter Forsberg]] had emergency spleen surgery after their second-round series against the Kings. Forsberg would miss the rest of the playoffs. The Avalanche would meet the defending champion [[New Jersey Devils]] in the Stanley Cup Final. The Devils, who played in Colorado as the [[Colorado Rockies (NHL)|Rockies]] from 1976-82, took a 3-2 series onto home ice for game six. Colorado would win 4-0 and then take game seven back in Colorado by a score of 3-1. Goalie Patrick Roy won his record third [[Conn Smythe Trophy]], but all eyes were on Bourque after the game. Joe Sakic was handed the Cup from [[NHL Commissioner]] [[Gary Bettman]], and in a true show of class, immediately gave the Stanley Cup to Ray Bourque, capping off his 22-year career with his only championship.

Colorado has not been able to capture that moment of glory since 2001. After falling to Detroit in the [[2001-02 NHL season|2002]] Conference Final, the Avs would blow a 3-1 series lead on the [[Minnesota Wild]] in the first-round of the [[2002-03 NHL season|2003]] playoffs, losing in overtime of Game 7. In the 2003 offseason, Patrick Roy would announce his retirement. Later, on July 1, Colorado shocked the hockey world when they signed star wingers [[Paul Kariya]] and [[Teemu Selänne]] from the [[Anaheim Ducks|Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]]. Despite Roy's departure, the Avs would become the NHL favorite to win the [[2003-04 NHL season|2004]] Cup almost immediately after the signings, but Kariya and Selänne failed to live up to expections and the hype surrounding their acquisitions. For the first time since 1994-95, the Avs failed to win their division, ending an NHL-record eight consecutive division titles.

[[Image:Colorado-alternate.gif||thumb|right|150px|Colorado's alternate logo; the foot of [[Bigfoot]], a mythical creature.]]
After the [[2004-05 NHL lockout]] and the implementation of a salary cap, the Avalanche lost Forsberg and Foote to free agency with the hope of keeping Sakic (whose contract would expire after the following season) and other key players. In a money-saving effort to replace the two, veterans [[Pierre Turgeon]] and [[Patrice Brisebois]] were signed, though many knew they could not fill the shoes of Forsberg and Foote. The team struggled at times in [[2005-06 NHL season|2005-06]], but surprising seasons from [[rookie]] [[Marek Svatos]] and other young players led to a first-round upset of Dallas. At the 2006 trade deadline, general manager [[Pierre Lacroix]] made a questionable trade, sending goalie [[David Aebischer]], who had recovered from some early-season difficulties to reassert himself as the starter, to the [[Montreal Canadiens]] for struggling, former [[Hart Trophy|Hart]] and [[Vezina Trophy]]-winning netminder [[Jose Theodore]]. Avalanche fans and hockey analysts alike questioned the move, while some wondered if Lacroix was attempting the same kind of trade he made eleven years earlier, when he acquired Roy from the Habs.

A day after the Avalanche were swept in the second round by the [[Duck]]s, Lacroix resigned and [[François Giguère]] was hired.

On June 20, Joe Sakic was re-signed to a one-year contract. Four days later at the [[2006 NHL Entry Draft]], the Avs traded [[Alex Tanguay]] to the rival [[Calgary Flames]] for defenseman [[Jordan Leopold]] &mdash; who had fallen out of favor with Flames GM/then-coach [[Darryl Sutter]]. Rob Blake left for his former team, the Los Angeles Kings, and forward [[Dan Hinote]] also moved on, signing with the [[St. Louis Blues (hockey)|St. Louis Blues]], leaving Sakic and [[Milan Hejduk]] as the only two remaining members since the 2001 Cup team. Sakic is the only player left from the team's days in Quebec (though Hejduk was drafted by the Nordiques), but prospect [[Paul Stastny]], son of Nordiques legend [[Peter Stastny]], also provides a link to the past.

After a record 487 consecutive games, the NHL's longest consecutive attendance sellout ended with the Avalanche on [[October 16]], [[2006]] after a reported attendance of 17,681 which was 326 under capacity at the [[Pepsi Center]] before an Avalanche-[[Chicago Blackhawks]] game, which the [[Hawk]]s ultimately won 5-4. The streak began on [[November 9]], [[1995]], the Avalanche's eighth [[regular season]] home game during the [[1995-96 NHL season]], before a sellout of 16,061 at the [[McNichols Sports Arena]] versus the [[Dallas Stars]]. The Avs recorded their 500th home sellout in Denver on the 20th of [[January]] [[2007]], recording a home sellout percentage (playoffs and regular season) of 97% (500 out of 515). The Avalanche won that game 3-1 against the [[Detroit Red Wings]][http://www.coloradoavalanche.com/News/NewsDetails.aspx?NID=780]
