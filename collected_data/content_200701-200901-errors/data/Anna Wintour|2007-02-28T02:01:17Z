'''Anna Wintour''' (born [[November 3]], [[1949]]) is the [[Editing|Editor]]-in-Chief of the [[U.S.]] edition of ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', a position she has held since 1988. A native [[London]]er of [[English people|English]] and [[United States|American]] parentage, she became interested in [[fashion]] as a teenager and advised her father Charles, editor of the ''[[Evening Standard]]'', on how to better make the [[newspaper]] appealing to the youth of mid-1960s [[Britain]]. After dropping out of school at 16, she forsook college to start a career in journalism on both sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] that stopped at ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' and ''[[Home & Garden]]'' before she took over at British ''Vogue'' and finally the flagship magazine in [[New York]]. She succeeded in turning around a faltering product and has been widely recognized in the publishing industry for her success.

Like her predecessor [[Diana Vreeland]], she has become a fashion [[icon]] in her own right. Her [[bob cut|bob]] [[haircut]] and [[sunglasses]] have become a common sight in the front row of the most exclusive [[fashion show]]s.

She has become as much of an institution in the fashion world as the magazine she edits. Universally hailed for her keen eye for fashion trends and support for younger [[fashion designer|designers]], her aloof and demanding persona has earned her the nickname "Nuclear Wintour". A former [[personal assistant]] of hers, [[Lauren Weisberger]], wrote the [[2003 in literature|2003]] [[best seller|bestselling]] ''[[roman á clef]]'' ''[[The Devil Wears Prada (novel)|The Devil Wears Prada]]'', later made into a successful [[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|film]] starring [[Meryl Streep]] as [[Miranda Priestly]], a fashion editor widely believed to be based on Wintour. She has also drawn both praise and criticism for her willingness to use the magazine and its cachet to shape the industry as a whole. [[Animal rights]] activists have also singled her out for her continued promotion of [[fur]].

==Family==

Her father, [[Charles Vere Wintour]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]], was an  editor of The ''[[Evening Standard]]''. Her mother was Wintour's first wife, Eleanor ("Nonie") Trego Baker, the daughter of a [[Harvard Law School|Harvard law professor]], whom he [[marriage|married]] in 1940 and [[divorce]]d in 1979. She was named after her maternal grandmother, Anna (Gilkyson) Baker, a [[Philadelphia]] socialite.<ref name="Oppenheimer2">Oppenheimer, Jerry;''Front Row: The Cool Life and Hot Times of Vogue's Editor In Chief'', St. Martin's Press, New York, 2005, ISBN 0-3123-231-07, 2</ref> Her stepmother is Audrey Slaughter, a magazine editor who founded such British publications as ''Honey'' and ''Petticoat''.

Wintour had four siblings, three of whom survive: James Charles, the [[managing director]] of [[Gravesham]] Borough Council;<ref name="Gravesham">Gravesham Borough Council; 20 August 2004; [http://www.gravesham.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=1173 Council’s Top Job is Filled]; retrieved December 6, 2006.</ref> Nora Hilary Wintour, the deputy general secretary of [[Public Services International]] in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]];<ref name="Nora Wintour">[http://www.world-psi.org/TemplateEn.cfm?Section=PSI_staff&Template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID=13041 PSI staff]; retrieved from world-psi.org February 2, 2007.</ref> [[Patrick Wintour]], who started as labour correspondent at ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 1983 and rose to become the political editor for both it and the ''[[The Observer]]'' in 2006.<ref name="Patrick Wintour"> [http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardiancontacts/page/0,,326716,00.html Patrick Wintour, chief political correspondent]; ''[[The Guardian]]''; retrieved December 6, 2006.</ref> Her eldest brother, Gerald Jackson Wintour, died as a child in 1951 when he was struck by a car.<ref name="Oppenheimer28">Oppenheimer, ''op. cit.'', 28</ref>

Her [[aunt]] Cordelia Wintour married [[Eric James, Baron James of Rusholme|Sir Eric James]], who was granted a [[life peer]]age as Baron James of [[Rusholme]].

==Early life==

The young Wintour was educated at [[North London Collegiate School]], where she frequently rebelled against the [[dress code]] by wearing her [[skirt]]s so that the [[hem]] was higher than allowed.<ref name="Oppenheimer15">Oppenheimer, ''op.cit.'', 15</ref> At the age of 14 she began wearing her hair in the [[bob cut|bob]] that has since become her trademark. As London began to [[Swinging London|swing]], she became a dedicated follower of fashion as a regular viewer of [[Cathy McGowan]] on ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]'', and her father regularly consulted her when he was considering ideas for increasing readership in the youth market. In her later teens, she began dating [[gossip columnist]] [[Nigel Dempster]] and became a fixture on the London club circuit with him.<ref name="Oppenheimer36-37">Oppenheimer, ''op. cit.'', 36-37.</ref>

==Career==
===From fashion to journalism===

At 16, Anna dropped out of North London Collegiate. Wintour chose not to go to college but instead entered a training program at [[Harrods]]. At her parents' behest, she also took some fashion classes at a nearby school, but soon dropped out, telling her friend Vivienne Lasky that "you either know fashion or you don't".<ref name="Oppenheimer51">Oppenheimer, ''op. cit.'', 51.</ref> At Harrod's, she continued dating well-connected older men, in this case Peter Gitterman, the stepson of [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] conductor [[Georg Solti]].

She entered the field of [[fashion journalism]] in 1970 when ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' merged with ''Queen'' to become, for a time, ''Harper's & Queen''. There, she discovered model [[Annabel Hodin]], a former North London classmate, and used the connections she had built up to secure locations for some striking, innovative shoots.<ref name="Oppenheimer81">Oppenheimer, ''op. cit.'', 81.</ref> One recreated the works of [[Renoir]] and [[Manet]] using models in [[go-go boots]].<ref name="Met bio">[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]; January 12, 1999; [http://www.metmuseum.org/Press_Room/full_release.asp?prid={44C504B8-C28F-11D3-936E-00902786BF44} Anna Wintour elected honorary trustee]; retrieved December 6, 2006.</ref> After a short stint at a small magazine named ''[[Savvy]]'',<ref name="Larson">Larson, Christina; April 2005; [http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2005/0504.larson2.html From Venus To Minerva]; ''[[Washington Monthly]]''; retrieved December 11, 2006.</ref> Wintour would move on to become a junior fashion editor at [[Harper's Bazaar]] in New York in 1975,<ref name="Met bio" /> where she lasted less than a year before being fired.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Anna went on to become editor in charge of fashion at ''[[Viva (magazine)|Viva]]''.<ref name="Larson" /> According to Jerry Oppenheimer's biography ''Front Row'', she would later omit mention of the magazine in her career because of its connections to ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]''. After three years, she moved on to become fashion editor of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]''.<ref name="Met bio" />

===British ''Vogue''=== 

She became editor of ''British Vogue'' in [[1986]] and ''[[House & Garden (magazine)|House & Garden]]'' the following year. At the former, she told her father's old paper, the ''Evening Standard'', she wanted to reach "a new kind of woman out there. She's interested in business and money. She doesn't have time to shop anymore. She wants to know what and why and where and how."<ref name="Larson" /> 

At the latter, she was so fond of putting couture in photo spreads that industry wags began to refer to the magazine as ''House & Garment''.<ref name="Slate">Fortini, Amanda; February 10, 2005; [http://www.slate.com/id/2113278/ Defending ''Vogue'''s evil genius]; ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''; retrieved December 6, 2006.</ref>  She managed to turn around and increase circulation of ''British Vogue'' but her couture photo spreads turned off [[Subscription business model|subscribers]] to ''House & Garden'' such that it would eventually close down after she left. "She destroyed ''House & Garden'' in about two days," complained a fired editor, noting that she had, in her first week, killed photo spreads and articles that had cost $2 million.<ref name="Time 1988">Zuckerman, Lawrence; June 13, 1988; [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,967685-1,00.html The Dynamic Duo at Conde Nast]; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''; retrieved February 8, 2007.</ref>  (Later, it would be revived by its parent company, [[Conde Nast]]).

===American ''Vogue''=== 

She was expected to do the same at American ''Vogue'', when she took over in 1988. It had, under her predecessor [[Grace Mirabella]], become more focused on lifestyles as a whole and less on fashion.<ref name="Slate" /> Industry insiders worried that it was losing ground to the upstart ''[[ELLE]]'',<ref name="Slate" /> which had been introduced to America from France in 1985.<ref name="Larson" /> Wintour made her mark early on with a shift in the cover pictures. Whereas Mirabella had preferred tight [[Head shot|headshots]] of well-known models, Wintour's covers showed more of the body and were taken outside, in [[natural light]], instead of the [[studio]], echoing what Vreeland had done years earlier.<ref name="Larson" /> She used less well-known models, and mixed inexpensive clothes with the high fashion — the first issue she was in charge of, in November of that year, featured a young [[Israel]]i model in a $50 pair of faded [[jeans]] and a bejeweled [[T-shirt]] by [[Christian Lacroix]] worth 200 times that (200 x $50 = $10,000). Eight months later, another model was shown in wet hair, with just a [[terrycloth]] [[bathrobe]] and apparently without [[makeup]].<ref name="Slate" /> She also made a point of seeing to it that photographers, [[makeup]] artists and [[hairstylist]]s got as much credit for the images as the models.<ref name="Larson" />

Under her editorship, the magazine renewed its focus on fashion and returned to the prominence it had held under [[Diana Vreeland]]. The September 2004 issue boasted a record 832 pages, the largest issue of a monthly magazine ever published at that time.<ref name="Slate" /> She has also overseen the introduction of three spinoff titles: ''[[Teen Vogue]]'', ''[[Vogue Living]]'' and ''[[Men's Vogue]]''. ''Teen Vogue'' has outpaced its two top competitors, ''[[ELLE Girl]]'' and ''[[Cosmo Girl]]'' in ad pages and dollars, and the 164 ad pages in the debut issue of ''Men's Vogue'' were the most for a first issue in Conde Nast history.<ref name="Folio">March 29, 2006; [http://www.foliomag.com/viewmedia.asp?prmMID=5843&prmID=249 Anna Wintour:Editor-in-Chief, Vogue]; ''Folio:''; retrieved February 7, 2007.</ref> Her accomplishment in expanding the brand earned her the coveted title of "Editor of the Year," by the industry trade magazine ''[[Advertising Age|AdAge]].<ref name="Editor of the Year">October 22, 2006; "[http://adage.com/amc06/article?article_id=112639 Magazine Editor of the Year: Anna Wintour]"; ''[[Advertising Age]]''; retrieved February 8, 2007.</ref>

Her salary is reported to be $5 million a year and she also receives generous perks including a $50,000 clothes budget, a [[chauffeur]] and a suite at the [[Hôtel Ritz Paris]] whilst attending Paris Fashion Week.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

[[A & E]] [[IndieFilms]] and [[R.J. Cutler]] are to shoot a feature-length documentary chronicling the making of Vogue's September issue. Cutler had approached Wintour in 2004 and will direct the untitled pic which will be shot over eight months as Wintour prepares the fall fashion issue, known in the industry as the "fashion bible". The filmmakers plan to have the pic completed in 2008 

===Fashion industry power broker===

Anna Wintour, through the years, has become one of the most powerful people in fashion, setting trends and anointing new designers. ''[[The Guardian]]'' has called her the "unofficial mayoress" of [[New York City]].<ref name="Unofficial mayoress">Pilkington, Ed; 5 December 2006; [http://www.guardian.co.uk/elsewhere/journalist/story/0,,1964329,00.html Central Bark]; ''The Guardian''; retrieved December 6, 2006.</ref> She has worked behind the scenes to encourage fashion houses to hire younger, fresher designers such as [[John Galliano]], who owes his position at [[Christian Dior]] to her intervention. She persuaded [[Donald Trump]] to let [[Marc Jacobs]] use a [[ballroom]] at the [[Plaza Hotel]] for a [[fashion show|show]] when he and his partner were short of cash. More recently, she persuaded [[Brooks Brothers]] to hire the relatively unknown [[Thom Browne]].<ref name="Citizen Anna">Horyn, Cathy; February 1, 2007; "[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/01/fashion/01WINTOUR.htm Citizen Anna]"; ''[[The New York Times]]''; retrieved February 2, 2007.</ref> Her protégée at ''Vogue'', [[Plum Sykes]], became a successful [[novel]]ist, drawing her settings from New York's fashionable élite.

Like many successful power brokers, she rarely makes her wishes known directly. Fashion industry [[publicist]]s say that a simple "Do you want me to go to Anna with this?" from a subordinate is often enough to settle a dispute in ''Vogue'''s favor.<ref name="Citizen Anna" />

==Personal life==
===Marriages and children===

She [[marriage|married]] child psychiatrist [[David Shaffer]] in 1984<ref name="Larson" /> and has two children by him, Charles (Charlie) and Katherine (known as Bee), who blogs for the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]''<ref name="Bee">Alexander, Hilary; February 15, 2006;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/main.jhtml?xml=/fashion/2006/02/15/efanna15.xml Wintour comes in from the cold]; ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''; retrieved February 7, 2007.</ref>(during both [[pregnancy|pregnancies]], she continued to wear [[Chanel]] [[miniskirt]]s to work<ref name="Acid Queen">June 25, 2006; "[http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,1806322,00.html Meet the acid queen of New York fashion]"; ''[[The Observer]]''; retrieved February 7, 2007.</ref>). 

The couple [[divorce]]d in 1999; [[tabloid]] newspapers and [[gossip columnist]]s speculated that it was an affair with [[millionaire]] [[investor]] [[Shelby Bryan]] that ended the marriage, but Wintour has refused to comment.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} She maintains an ongoing relationship with Bryan that friends say has mellowed her. "She smiles now and has been seen to laugh," the ''[[The Observer|Observer]]'' quoted one as saying.<ref name="Acid Queen" />

===Philanthropy=== 

Despite her infamous icy facade, Wintour is also a noted [[philanthropist]]. She serves as a [[trustee]] of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York.<ref name="Met bio" /> Wintour began the CFDA/Vogue Fund in order to encourage, support and mentor unknown fashion designers. She has also raised over $10 million for [[AIDS]] charities since 1990, by organizing various high profile benefits.<ref name="Met bio" />

===Work habits===

She rises daily before 6 a.m., plays [[tennis]] and has her hair and makeup done, then gets to ''Vogue'''s offices at 8. She always arrives at fashion shows at their scheduled starting time, whether or not they can be reasonably expected to do so. "I use the waiting time to make phone calls, make notes; I get some of my best ideas at the shows," she says.<ref name="Bee" /> According to the [[BBC]] [[documentary]] ''Boss Woman'', she is similarly efficient with her time elsewhere in her day, rarely staying at parties for more than 20 minutes at a time and getting to bed by 10:15 every night.<ref name="Boss Woman review">Media, David Lister; July 8, 2000; "[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20000708/ai_n14327782 You can't be too thin to survive Nuclear Wintour]"; ''[[The Independent]]''; retrieved from findarticles.com February 8, 2007.</ref>

At ''Vogue'', she reportedly has three full-time assistants (one more than suggested by ''The Devil Wears Prada'') but sometimes surprises callers by answering the phone herself.<ref name="Citizen Anna" /> Her good friend [[Barbara Amiel]] says that she often turns her [[cell phone]] off in order to eat lunch uninterrupted, and likes to have a good [[steak]] for her midday meal.<ref name="Amiel">Amiel, Barbara; July 2, 2006; "[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2006/07/02/svdevil02.xml The 'Devil' I know]"; ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''; retrieved February 6, 2007.</ref>

===Politics===

"Anna is a liberal," says Amiel. "She endorsed [[Al Gore]] in his presidential bid".<ref name="Amiel Maclean's">Amiel, Barbara; June 30, 2006; "[http://www.macleans.ca/culture/films/article.jsp?content=20060701_130331_130331 This devil isn't Anna]"; ''[[Maclean's]]''; retrieved February 8, 2007.</ref>

==Criticism==

While her success at turning ''Vogue'' around and her support of the fashion industry and charity work are universally acknowledged, that has not immunized her from criticism.

In [[2003 in literature|2003]], one of her former assistants, [[Lauren Weisberger]], published the [[bestseller|bestselling]] ''[[roman à clef]]'' ''[[The Devil Wears Prada (novel)|The Devil Wears Prada]]''. Its [[antagonist]], [[Miranda Priestly]], editor of the fictional ''Runway'', was widely believed to be based on Wintour.

Two years later, Wintour was the subject of an unauthorized [[biography]] by [[Jerry Oppenheimer]], ''Front Row: The Cool Life and Hot Times of Vogue's Editor In Chief'', that drew on many unnamed sources, often with grudges, to paint a similar portrait of the real woman. According to Oppenheimer, Wintour not only declined his requests for an interview but directed others not to cooperate.<ref name="Oppenheimerxi">Oppenheimer, ''op. cit.'', xi</ref> This is consistent with reports that she goes to great lengths to manage her public image. When she took over as American ''Vogue'' editor, gossip columnist [[Liz Smith (journalist)|Liz Smith]] reported rumors that she had gotten the job by having an [[affair]] with [[Condé Nast Publications]] [[chairman]] [[Si Newhouse]]. Wintour was reportedly furious and made her anger the subject of one of her first staff meetings.<ref name="Larson" />

There have also been accusations that she has imposed an [[elitism|elitist]] aesthetic on the magazine, promoting celebrities over fashion personalities and making demands that even prominent subjects change their image before being featured in its pages.
 
===Personality===

Accounts of her personality often describe it as cold. In his autobiographical comedy "How to Make Enemies and Alienate People," British journalist Toby Young nicknamed her "Nuclear Wintour" for her icy demeanor and alleged mood swings during her tenure at British ''Vogue'', an epithet that has been widely reused.<ref name="Bee" /> 

"I think she has been very rude to a lot of people in the past, on her way up--very terse," said the same friend the ''Observer'' quoted on the positive effect of her relationship with Bryan. "She doesn't do small talk. She is never going to be friends with her [[personal assistant|assistant]]".<ref name="Acid Queen" /> A former assistant said, "You definitely did not ride the [[elevator]] with her."<ref name="Stummer">Stummer, Robin; June 18, 2006; "[http://enjoyment.independent.co.uk/film/news/article1090199.ece Nuclear Wintour: The Movie]"; ''[[The Independent|The Independent on Sunday]]''; retrieved February 7, 2007.</ref> Even those who like her admit to some trepidation at her presence. "Anna happens to be a friend of mine," says Amiel, "a fact which is of absolutely no help in coping with the cold panic that grips me whenever we meet."<ref name="Amiel" />

She has often been described as a [[perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionist]] who routinely makes impossible, arbitrary demands of those who work for or under her, and treats them unkindly: "kitchen scissors at work," in the words of one commentator.<ref name="Slate" /> "The notion that Anna would want something done 'now' and not 'shortly' is accurate," Amiel says of ''The Devil Wears Prada''. "Anna wants what she wants right away."<ref name="Amiel Maclean's" /> She reportedly once made a junior staffer look through a photographer's [[garbage|trash]] to find a picture he had refused to give her.<ref name="Larson" /> In a frequently told story, a new [[intern]] at the magazine was told she must not make [[eye contact]] with Wintour or initiate conversation with her. One day in the hall, the intern saw Wintour trip and stepped over her rather than violate this [[Taboo on rulers|taboo]].<ref name="Acid Queen" /> 

Critics of Wintour's management style also point to a May 11, 2004 ruling by a New York court in a case brought against Wintour and Shaffer by the state [[Workers' Compensation]] Board. It sought to recover $140,000 in costs it had incurred when a former employee of the couple who had been injured on the job turned out not to have had the necessary [[insurance]] coverage. Wintour and Shaffer repeatedly failed to make payment, forcing the suit. The two were ordered to pay $104,403; an additional $32,639 was levied against Wintour herself.<ref name="TSG">Bastone, William; May 18, 2004; [http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/0518043anna1.html Wintour In $140,000 Worker's Comp Default]; ''[[The Smoking Gun]]''; retrieved December 10, 2006.</ref>
[[Image:The Devil Wears Prada cover.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Lauren Weisberger's ''roman á clef'', ''The Devil Wears Prada'', supposedly about Wintour and ''Vogue''.]]

===''The Devil Wears Prada''===

Weisberger's novel is told in the voice of Andrea "Andy" Sachs, a young woman fresh from college with literary ambitions. Andy gets a job as junior assistant to legendary editor [[Miranda Priestly]], who among her [[The Devil Wears Prada (novel)#Realism|other similarities]] to Wintour is British, has two young children, and serves on the board of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. Priestly is depicted as a [[tyranny|tyrant]] who makes impossible demands of her subordinates, gives them almost none of the information or time necessary to comply and then berates them for their failures to do so.<ref name="novel cite">Weisberger, Lauren; ''[[The Devil Wears Prada (novel)|The Devil Wears Prada]]'', Broadway Books, New York 2003, ISBN 0-7679-1476-7, 145</ref> Similar charges have long been made about Wintour herself by (usually unnamed) former employees. Prior to its publication, Wintour told the ''[[New York Times]]'', "I always enjoy a great piece of fiction. I haven't decided whether I am going to read it or not."<ref name="Times quote">Carr, David; February 17, 2003; [http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/17/business/media/17MAG.html?8hpib=&pagewanted=all&position=top Anna Wintour Steps Toward Fashion's New Democracy]; ''[[The New York Times]]''; retrieved December 10, 2006.</ref>

While it has been suggested that the setting and Priestly were based on ''Vogue'' and Wintour, Weisberger denies this, and even gives Wintour herself a cameo appearance near the end of the book (In her less-successful second novel, ''[[Everyone Worth Knowing]]'', the main character doesn't think she's capable of working for Wintour when her uncle suggests it<ref name="Everyone Worth Knowing">Weisberger, Lauren; ''[[Everyone Worth Knowing]]'', Downtown Press, New York, 2005, ISBN 0743262336, 37-38.</ref>).

Yet it is almost universally believed that the book's success was due to the real-life angle. Neither ''Vogue'' nor any other Conde Nast publications, nor many other popular women's magazines, reviewed Weisberger's book. When the film was released, one of the company's magazines, ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ran a review of the film by [[David Denby]] that disparaged the novel in comparison.<ref name="New Yorker DWP review">[[David Denby|Denby, David]]; July 10 & 17, 2006; "[http://www.newyorker.com/critics/cinema/articles/060710crci_cinema Dressed to Kill]"; ''[[The New Yorker]]''; retrieved February 6, 2007.</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'''s [[Janet Maslin]] avoided mentioning Wintour's name in one of the paper's two negative reviews of the book.<ref name="Maslin DWP review">[[Janet Maslin|Maslin, Janet]]; April 14, 2003; BOOKS OF THE TIMES:[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02EEDF133BF937A25757C0A9659C8B63 Elegant Magazine, Avalanche Of Dirt]; ''[[The New York Times]]''; retrieved February 7, 2007.</ref> Its favorable notice of the movie mentioned neither ''Vogue'' nor Wintour.<ref name="NYT DWP film review">[[A.

====Film adaptation====

During production of [[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|the movie]] in 2005, Wintour was reportedly pressuring prominent fashion personalities, particularly designers, not to make [[cameo appearance]]s in the movie lest they be banished from the magazine's pages, at least temporarily.<ref name="Radar">{{cite web|url=http://www.radarmagazine.com/fresh-intelligence/2005/11/09/index.php#report_004079|title=The Devil You Know, On Line One|accessdate=2006-07-01|work=Fresh Intelligence|date=2005-11-09}}</ref> She denied it through a spokesperson who said she was interested in anything that "supports fashion". But, while many designers are mentioned in the film, only one, [[Valentino Garavani]], actually appeared as himself.<ref name="Radar" />

The film was released, in mid-2006, to great commercial success.<ref name="boxofficemojo">[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=devilwearsprada.htm The Devil Wears Prada] at boxofficemojo.com, retrieved February 8, 2007.</ref> Wintour attended the [[premiere]] wearing [[Prada]]. In the film, actress [[Meryl Streep]] plays a Priestly different enough from the book's to receive critical praise as an entirely original (and more sympathetic) character (although Streep's office in the film bears similarities striking enough to Wintour's<ref name="office photos">See photos of both at [http://www.oficinadeestilo.com.br/blog/wp-content/office.jpg this page], retrieved December 6, 2006.</ref> that the latter reportedly had it redecorated after the film's release<ref name="Whitworth">Whitworth, Melissa; June 9, 2006; "[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/main.jhtml?xml=/fashion/2006/09/06/efpatricia06.xml The Devil has all the best costumes]"; ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''; retrieved February 6, 2007.</ref>). Streep denies that her portrayal was based on Wintour, whom the actress says she only met at the first benefit screening of the film. She stated she had no interest in doing a documentary on the ''Vogue'' editor, preferring to draw her inspiration from an amalgam of [[uber|über]]bosses she had met over the years. 

Amiel reported that her first reaction was to say that the film would probably go straight to [[DVD]].<ref name="Amiel" /> It went on to make over US$ 300 million in worldwide box office receipts. Later in 2006, in an interview with [[Barbara Walters]] which aired the same day the DVD was released, Wintour said she found the film "really entertaining" and praised it for making fashion "entertaining and glamorous and interesting.... I was one hundred percent behind it".<ref name="Barbara Walters">Walters, Barbara; December 12, 2006; [http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=2716887&page=3 Anna Wintour: Always in Vogue]; "The 10 Most Fascinating People of 2006"; retrieved from abcnews.go.com December 18, 2006.</ref>

While Wintour may have borne no malice toward the film and those involved in it, the same may not be true regarding Weisberger. When ''[[New York Daily News|Daily News]]'' [[gossip columnist]] [[Lloyd Grove]] reported shortly before the film's release that the author was having enough trouble with her third novel (after disappointing sales of her second) that her editor suggested she completely start over, there was enough [[bitterness]] left that Wintour's spokesman Patrick O'Connell suggested she "should get a job as someone else's assistant."<ref name="Lloyd Grove">Grove, Lloyd; May 2, 2006; [http://www.nydailynews.com/news/gossip/story/413881p-349908c.html Author goes from Prada to nada]; ''[[New York Daily News|Daily News]]''; retrieved May 2, 2006.</ref>

===PETA campaign===

She has often been the target of various [[animal rights]] organizations such as [[PETA]] who are angered by her use of fur in Vogue, her pro-fur editorials and her refusal to run paid advertisements from animal rights organizations. Undeterred, she continues to use fur in photo spreads. She is routinely assaulted by activists over this matter. 

In Paris in [[October 2005]], she was hit with a [[tofu]] pie while waiting to get into the [[Chloé]] show.<ref name="USA Today">[[Associated Press]]; October 2005; [http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2005-10-10-vogue-wintour_x.htm?POE=LIFISVA Anti-fur demonstrators hit 'Vogue' editor with a pie in Paris] ''[[USA Today]]''; retrieved December 8, 2006.</ref> She herself said she has been physically attacked so many times she's "lost count."{{Fact|date=February 2007}} She and ''Vogue'''s publisher Ron Galotti (himself the inspiration of a fictional character as Mr. Big from [[Sex and the City]]) once retaliated for a protest outside the Conde Nast offices during the company's annual [[Christmas]] party by sending down a plate of steaming, freshly cooked [[roast beef]].<ref name="Page Six">Johnson, Richard; December 19, 1997; [http://www.voguesucks.com/artwint6.gif Vogue fights PETA beef with beef]; [[Page Six]], ''[[The New York Post]]''; retrieved from voguesucks.com December 8, 2006.</ref>

===Elitism===

Some critics have charged that instead of models, celebrities are becoming the face of ''Vogue''.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Indeed, a wide range of prominent women have graced the front cover of Vogue during Wintour's tenure, from Oscar-winning actresses ([[Nicole Kidman]], [[Charlize Theron]], and [[Angelina Jolie]]) to celebrities ([[Melania Trump]] and [[Kate Winslet]]) and politicians ([[Hillary Clinton]]).

According to insiders, however, she has not been content to let celebrities appear on the cover, but has demanded they bow to her standards as well. [[Oprah Winfrey]] was reportedly told she would not be photographed for the cover until she lost weight, and Clinton would not appear until she stopped wearing navy blue [[suit (clothing)|suit]]s as much as she had been.<ref name="Slate" /> At the 2005 Anglomania celebration, a ''Vogue''-sponsored salute to British fashion at the Met, Wintour is said to have gone beyond mere approval and personally chose the clothes that prominent attendees such as [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Kate Moss]], [[Donald Trump]] and [[Diane von Furstenberg]] wore.<ref name="Acid Queen" /> "I don’t think [[Diana Vreeland|Vreeland]] had that kind of concentration", says ''[[Women's Wear Daily]]'' publisher Patrick McCarthy. "She wouldn’t have dressed Babe Paley. Nor would Babe Paley have let her".<ref name="Citizen Anna" />

Another writer for the magazine complained that Wintour excluded ordinary working women, many of whom are regular subscribers, from the pages. "She's obsessed only about reflecting the aspirations of a certain class of reader," the writer says." "We once had a piece about [[breast cancer]] which started with an [[flight attendant|airline stewardess]], but she wouldn't have a stewardess in the magazine so we had to go and look for a high-flying businesswoman who'd had cancer."<ref name="Slate" /> 

Wintour has been accused of exercising her power to set herself apart even from ostensible peers. "I do not think fiction could surpass the reality", an unnamed British fashion magazine editor says of ''The Devil Wears Prada''. "[A]rt in this instance is only a poor imitation of life." Wintour, the editor says, routinely requests that her seats at New York fashion shows are located such that she is not only separated from competing editors but cannot even see or be seen by them, either.<ref name="Acid Queen" /> Further,
<blockquote>
We spend our working lives telling people which it-bag to carry but Anna is so above the rest of us she does not even have a [[handbag]]. She has a limo. And she has her walkers [[André Leon Talley]] and Hamish Bowles, whose main job is to carry her bits around for her.<ref name="Acid Queen" />
</blockquote>
Amiel confirms this practice. "Why she has this routine I don't know. Certainly it unnerves females ... Obviously it is part of the persona".<ref name="Amiel Maclean's" /> 

Some of her intercessions on behalf of designers, particularly [[Georgina Chapman]] (currently dating film mogul [[Harvey Weinstein]]), have also been criticized as being motivated by personal connections rather than talent. By persuading designers to loan clothes to prominent [[socialite]]s and celebrities, who are then photographed wearing the clothes not only in ''Vogue'' but more general-interest magazines like ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' and ''[[Us (magazine)|Us]]'', which in turn influence what buyers want, some in the industry believe Wintour is exerting too much control over it, especially since she is not involved in making or producing clothes herself. "The end result is that Anna can control it all the way to the selling floor", says Candy Pratts Price, executive fashion director at [[style.com]].<ref name="Citizen Anna" />

===Responses===

Wintour has rarely, if ever, personally responded to criticisms of her, as most critics have been her employees or others with something to gain by remaining in her favor. But there have been a few defenses from other quarters. Amanda Fortini at ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' said she was just fine with Wintour's elitism since that was intrinsic to fashion and, ultimately, good for the magazine's readers:
{{quote|In a sea of women's glossies that purport to be about fashion but publish earnest articles chronicling the author's quest for self-actualization, ''Vogue'' stands apart. The voluminous fashion pages are arty, original, and sophisticated, shot by talented photographers like [[Annie Leibovitz]], [[Irving Penn]], and [[Steven Meisel]]. Most of us read ''Vogue'' not with the intention of buying the wildly expensive clothes, but because doing so educates our eye and hones our taste, similar to the way eating gourmet food refines the [[palate]]. This is a pleasure enabled by Wintour's ruthless aesthetic, her refusal to participate in the democratizing tendency of most of her competitors. To deny her that privilege is to deny her readers the privilege of fantasy in the form of beautifully photographed [[Paris]] couture.<ref name="Slate" />}}

Responses to horror stories about her treatment of employees have frequently been met with charges of [[sexism]], that similar behavior from a male boss would seem unremarkable. "Powerful women in the media always get inspected more thoroughly than their male counterparts", said the ''New York Times'' in a piece about Wintour shortly after the film's release.<ref name="Times Wintour film piece">Carr, David; July 10, 2006; "[http://plainsfeminist.blogspot.com/2006/07/devil-you-say.html The Devil Wears Teflon]"; ''The New York Times'', retrieved from plainsfeminist.blogspot.com December 10, 2006.</ref> Wintour has been likened to [[Martha Stewart]] and fellow Condé Nast editor [[Tina Brown]], both of whom also have been described as overbearing and abusive to those who work for them.

Some of her defenders have even seen her as [[feminism|feminist]] whose changes to ''Vogue'' have actually in a small way reflected, acknowledged and reinforced advances in the status of women. In a nominal review of Oppenheimer's book in the ''[[Washington Monthly]]'', [[managing editor]] Christina Larson notes that ''Vogue'', unlike many other women's magazines, doesn't play to its readership's sense of inadequacy:
{{quote|Unlike its glossy peers on the newsstand, it isn't loaded with tips to flatten your [[Human abdomen|abs]], flaunt your [[cleavage]], or squeeze into your thin jeans by Friday; it assumes you need no help mastering love moves no man can resist. It doesn't purport to solve problems, to help you feel less guilty. Instead, it reminds women to take satisfaction, parading all manner of fineries (clothes, furniture, travel destinations) that a successful woman might buy, or at least admire. While it surely exists to sell ads — which it does remarkably well — it does so primarily by exploiting ambition, not insecurity.<ref name="Larson" />}}
She contrasts Vreeland's Vogue with Wintour's by noting how the former treated female beauty as something innate, whereas Wintour showed how it could be created. "She shifted ''Vogue'''s focus from the cult of beauty to the cult of the creation of beauty ... Beyond whisking models off their pedestals, the concept that grace is a construction, and not merely a gift, allows that it can be enjoyed longer, well past the age of 40 or 50".<ref name="Larson" /> To her, the focus on celebrities is a welcome development as it means that women are making the cover of ''Vogue'' at least in part for what they have accomplished, not just how they look. "Wintour's ''Vogue'' allows women to imagine a world, increasingly an attainable one, in which the pursuit of beauty reinforces rather than overshadows female authority", she concludes.<ref name="Larson" />

Concerns about her role as an ''[[eminence grise]]'' of the fashion world are allayed by those familiar with how she uses that power, who say she is not manipulative. "She’s honest. She tells you what she thinks. Yes is yes and no is no", according to [[Karl Lagerfeld]]. "She’s not too pushy" agrees [[François-Henri Pinault]], [[chief executive officer]] of [[PPR (company)|PPR]], [[Gucci]]'s parent company. "She lets you know it’s not a problem if you can’t do something she wants. But she makes you understand that if you could, she would be very supportive with her magazine." 

Her defenders also suggest her power over the industry is neither as vindictively applied, nor as absolute, as is often believed. She continued to support Gucci despite her strong belief PPR was making a major mistake letting [[Tom Ford]] go. Designers such as [[Alice Roi]] and [[Isabel Toledo]] have become rising stars in the industry without indulging Wintour or ''Vogue''.<ref name="Citizen Anna" />

She has also earned praise for her tenacity. "Once a friend, that's it", Amiel quotes Talley as saying, after Wintour helped him overcome a serious [[obesity|weight problem]]. Amiel herself agrees that "her singular quality is one of loyalty".<ref name="Amiel Maclean's" /> This carries over into her professional life. Her willingness to throw her weight around has helped keep ''Vogue'' independent despite its heavy reliance on advertising dollars. Wintour was the only fashion editor who refused to follow an [[Armani]] [[ultimatum]] to feature more of its clothes in the magazine's editorial pages if it was running the company's ads.<ref name="Acid Queen" />

Even ''The Devil Wears Prada'' is not without some admiration for Wintour/Priestly. Weisberger, through Andy, notes that she does manage the difficult task of making all the major editorial decisions in a major fashion magazine every month all by herself<ref name="novel cite1">Weisberger, ''op. cit.'', 208.</ref> and that she does have genuine class and style.<ref name="novel cite2">Weisberger, ''op. cit.'', 271-21.</ref>

==In popular culture==

*[[Edna Mode]], in the [[2004 in film|2004]] hit [[animation|animated]] film ''[[The Incredibles]]'', was believed to have been at least partially inspired by Wintour, due to the similar bob haircut.

*The HBO series ''[[Tracey Takes On]]'', starring [[Tracey Ullman]], also featured a similar Anna Wintour character.

*Wintour is referenced in another HBO series, ''[[Sex and the City]]'', when [[Carrie Bradshaw]] is interviewed for a job at Vogue. Carrie gets drunk with an editor in his Vogue office, who tries to subtly help the tipsy Bradshaw make her way out of the building. On her way she bumps in to a female employee and, embarrassed, says "please tell me that wasn't Anna Wintour".

*''[[Ugly Betty]]'''s character Fey Sommers shares some characteristics as Wintour, such as the bob and sunglasses, being the editor of a fashion magazine, and having a last name that sound like a season. Wintour is also referenced in the series after [[Bradford Meade]] is arrested and [[Wilhelmina Slater]] is poised to take over as Editor-in-Chief of the magazine. Wilhelmina is informed by her assistant that Wintour called with an invitation to lunch, which Wilhelmina declines.

*There are several references of Anna throughout [[Robert Altman|Robert Altman's]] [[1994]] film "[[Prêt-à-Porter (film)|Prêt-à-Porter]]"; on the featured fashion shows, fashion critics sitting on the front row wear sunglasses. The fictional fashion editor, Regina Krumm (played by [[Linda Hunt]]) has a similar haircut style.
