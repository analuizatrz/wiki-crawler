'''Min-nyi Min-tha''' was the common title for all Princes of the Blood of the Burmese monarchy, i.e. sons, grandsons, brothers and nephews of a sovereign, who were all assigned fiefdoms when they came of age, and promoted to this rank.

==Specific ranks and titles for dynasty members==
It was divided into four principal grades, as follows, awarded individually:
* The Great Deputy King: '''[[Maha Uparaja]] Anaudrapa Ainshe Min''', incorrectly termed Crown Prince by Europeans, and addressed as His Royal Highness.
* Viceroy or governor of a province: (territorial title) '''Buring [[Khan]]''', i.e. Viceroy, with the style of His Royal Highness.
* Great Princes, a maximum of eigteen at any one time, divided into nine great princes of the left and nine great princes of the right: Minthaya-gyi, together with the rank of '''Sado Min''', i.e. Prince, with the style of His Royal Highness.
* Middle Princes, a maximum of eigteen at any one time, divided into nine middle princes of the left and nine middle princes of the right: Mintha-lap, together with the rank of '''Min Ye''', Prince, with the style of His Royal Highness.

Specific titles were also used not by office, but by birth; however these were NOT indicative of the succession, for which there were no effective rules, a power struggle in the palace was the rule
*The eldest son of the sovereign, by his chief Queen: '''Shwe Kodaw-gyi Awratha''', i.e. Prince with the style of His Royal Highness.
* younger sons of the sovereign, by his chief Queen: '''Shwe Kodaw-gyi [[Rajaputra]]''', i.e. Prince with the style of His Royal Highness.
