The Holy Apostolic and Catholic [[Assyrian Church of the East]] is a Christian church that traces its origins to the [[episcopal see|See]] of [[Babylon]], said to be founded by [[Saint Thomas the Apostle]].  In India, it is known as the [[Chaldean Syrian Church]]. In the West it is often known, inaccurately, as the Nestorian Church. The Assyrian Church is the original Christian church in what was once [[Parthia]]; today [[Iraq]] and western [[Iran]]. Geographically it stretched in the medieval period to China and India: a monument found in Xi'an (Hsi-an), the Tang-period capital of China (originally Chang'an), in Chinese and Syriac described the activities of the church in the 7th and 8th century, while half a millennium later the Chinese monk [[Rabban Bar Sauma]] went from Beijing to Paris and Rome to call for a crusade with the Mongols against the Mamelukes. Prior to the Portuguese arrival in India in 1498, it provided "East Syrian" bishops to the Saint Thomas Christians.

'''Mar Benyamin Shimon XXI''', was at one time the Patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East.  He was assassinated by a Kurdish Leader named Simko.  After his murder in 1915 the Kurdish people stripped and dragged his dead body in the village streets.

Mar Benyamain was ordained Metropolis by his uncle the then Patriarch, Mar Rowil (Ruben) Shimun, Catholicos Patriarch, XX.  Upon Mar Rowil's death, Mar Benyamin was ordained the twenty first Patriarch by [[Mar Yousip Khnanisho]], Bishop of [[Rustaqa]] and Mar Zaia Sargis, Bishop of [[Jilu]].  He was murdered in 1918 by an ambush of Simco and his men when Simco invited His Holiness Mar Benyamin under false pretenses of a peace accord.  The Rab Khaila Dawid d'Mar Shimun, Mar Benyamin's brother accompanied him and survived the onslaught of Kurdish gun fire.

'''Mar Eshai Shimun XXIII''', sometimes known as '''Mar Shimun XXI Ishaya''', Catholicos Patriarch of the [[Church of the East]] from [[1920]] until his assassination on November 6, [[1975]].  (The difference in regnal numbers depends on which members of the Shimun family one counts as Patriarchs;  Mar Eshai himself came to use the regnal number XXIII.)

Born into the patriarchal family in [[Qochanis|Qudshanis]] in 1908, Mar Eshai was chosen as patriarch on the death of his uncle.  He was educated in Britain and was the translator or author of several books on the theology and history of the Church of the East.  The uncertainties caused in 1933 by the independence of [[Iraq]] from colonial rule forced the patriarch's relocation to Cyprus and then, in 1940, to [[Chicago]].  Mar Eshai became an American citizen about 1949 and settled in the [[San Francisco]] area in 1954.
