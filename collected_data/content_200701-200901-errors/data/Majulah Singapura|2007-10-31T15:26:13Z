'''''Majulah Singapura''''' is the [[national anthem]] of [[Singapore]]. Composed by [[Zubir Said]], the song was selected in 1959 as the island's anthem. Upon full independence from [[Malaysia]] in 1965, Majulah Singapura was formally adopted as the national anthem. Originally written in [[Malay language|Malay]], the title means ''Onward Singapore.''

== History ==
The composing of ''Majulah Singapura'' occurred during a push for independence from the [[United Kingdom]]. Stared in 1956, [[Encik Zubir Said]] took a year to finish composing the music and lyrics for the song. The first public performance of the song was on [[December 3]], [[1959]], the same day the [[Flag of Singapore|national flag]] and the [[Coat of arms of Singapore|state crest]] was adopted. The timing of the adoption was centered around the inauguration of the [[Yang di-Pertuan Negara]], the Singapore head of state. The song was officially adopted as the national anthem in 1965, when Singapore achieved full independence after separating from Malaysia<ref name="anthem">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhb.gov.sg/PE/resources/national_symbols/national_anthem.html|title=The National Anthem|accessdate=2007-10-27|publisher=National Heritage Board|author=National Heritage Board}}</ref>
