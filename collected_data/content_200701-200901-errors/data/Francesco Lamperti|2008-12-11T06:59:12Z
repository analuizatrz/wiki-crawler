'''Francesco Lamperti''' (11 March 1811 or 1813 - 1 May 1892) was an [[Italy|Italian]] singing teacher.

A native of [[Savona]], Lamperti attended the [[Milan]] Conservatory where, beginning in 1850, he taught for a quarter of a century.  He was director at the Teatro Filodrammatico in [[Lodi]]. In 1875 he left the school and began to teach as a private tutor.  Among his pupils were [[Emma Albani]], [[Italo Campanini]], [[Marie van Zandt]], [[Herbert Witherspoon]], [[David Bispham]], both Cruvelis, Collini and [[Désirée Artôt]].  His methods were very similar to older Italian methods, and he wrote a number of [[treatise]]s on the subject.  

Lamperti was created a [[Order of the Crown of Italy|Commander of the Crown of Italy]] for his services to music.  He died in [[Como]] in 1892.

His son [[Giovanni Battista Lamperti]] (1839-1910) was also a well-known voice teacher.
