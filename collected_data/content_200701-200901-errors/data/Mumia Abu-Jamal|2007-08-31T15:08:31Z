</ref>) is a former [[Black Panther Party]] [[activist]], cab driver and local journalist from [[Philadelphia]] [[conviction|convicted]] for the [[murder]] of [[police officer]] [[Daniel Faulkner]] in 1981. He is serving a presently undefined [[Sentence (law)|sentence]] of [[imprisonment]] at State Correctional Institution - Greene near [[Waynesburg, Pennsylvania]] in consequence. Originally [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]], that sentence was quashed and resentencing ordered in December 2001 by a [[judge]] of the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania]]. Both he and the [[Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]] have [[appeal (law)|appealed]] the [[court ruling|ruling]] alternately as to the appropriateness of affirming the conviction and that of disaffirming the validity of the original sentence. 

His [[cause celebre|celebrated case]] has received [[international]] attention. Supporters and human rights campaigners variously assert that he is innocent, that the incident in question was a [[Actual innocence|setup]], that he did not receive a [[fair trial]], and/or express their opposition to the possibility of the administration of the [[death penalty]]. Skeptics and opponents assert that he is [[guilt (law)|guilty]], that he received the benefit of [[due process]] and was legitimately [[conviction|convicted]] of murder. Execution proponents among these assert that under Pennsylvania law, his eventual [[judicial execution]] is warranted and mandated by the nature of his crime.<ref>{{cite web

The attention received has spawned [[controversy|controversies]] surrounding references to him in [[music]] and [[toponymy|naming of public places]], as well as his status as a celebrated author, [[Honorary degree|honoree]] of [[municipal]], educational and [[civil society]] organizations, and his engagement as a [[radio host]], [[writer]] and [[commencement speaker]] in the United States.

As an [[adult]], he formally [[adopt]]ed the name. ''Mumia'' is [[Swahili language|Swahili]] in origin. "Abu-Jamal" which means [[father]] of Jamal (the name of his [[son]]) is [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in origin. He has not at any point asserted that his choice of name relates to [[Conversion to Islam#Conversion to Islam|religious conversion to Islam]] and he has never asserted that he is a [[Muslim]].  He expresses his religious beliefs, which follow no denomination, in his [[poetry]] [[book]] "Death Blossoms", which was published by a [[Christian]] [[Monasticism|monastic]] organization. Abu-Jamal continually expresses a belief in a "Mother God" who coexists with all [[male]] religious understandings.  An example is, "You call him [[God]]; I call him Mama."<ref>{{cite web

In the early hours of December 9, 1981, around 3:51 a.m., [[Philadelphia Police Department]] officer [[Daniel Faulkner]] was [[shooting|shot]] and [[kill]]ed during an altercation that ensued from a routine [[traffic stop]] of a vehicle driven by [[William Cook (street vendor)|William Cook]], Mumia's younger brother.<ref>{{cite web

<blockquote>1. During the traffic stop, Cook [[assault]]ed Faulkner, who in turn attempted to subdue Cook.<br /> 
2. Abu Jamal emerged from a nearby parking lot and shot Faulkner in the [[back]].<br /> 
3. Faulkner was able to return fire, seriously [[wound]]ing Mumia.<br />
4. Abu Jamal then advanced on Faulkner, fired some additional shots at close range, one of which struck Faulkner in the [[face]] causing his [[death]].<br />  
5. Abu Jamal was unable to flee due to his own [[gunshot injury|gunshot wound]], and was taken into [[arrest|custody]] by other police officers, who had been summoned by Faulkner at the time of the traffic stop.<br /></blockquote>

In Abu-Jamal's possession was a [[.38 Special|.38 caliber]] [[revolver]] that records showed he had purchased in 1979. The [[Cylinder (firearms)|cylinder]] of the revolver had five spent [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridges]]. He was taken directly from the scene of the shooting to a [[hospital]] and was treated for his [[injury]]. [[Witness]]es, including a [[security guard]] working at the hospital, stated that while he was receiving medical treatment, he acknowledged that he [[shooting|shot]] Daniel Faulkner (see [[Mumia Abu-Jamal#"Hospital bed" confession|"Hospital bed" confession]]). The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania contends that his version of events is not supported by [[testimony]] and [[physical evidence]] brought into consideration at his trial: that, in particular, it is inconsistent with the finding that a weapon registered in his name was identified as the weapon known to have administered the fatal gunshots to Daniel Faulkner's [[body]].<ref>{{cite web

He was [[indictment|charged]] with [[first-degree murder]]. He initially retained the services of [[Defense (legal)|criminal defense]] [[attorney]] Anthony Jackson.

=== Prosecution witnesses at trial ===
Four eyewitnesses to the shooting were produced by the [[prosecution]]:
 
<blockquote>1. Robert Chobert, a [[taxicab|cab]] [[driving|driver]];<br /> 
2. Michael Scanlon, a [[businessman]] who had been visiting from out of town on the night of the killing;<br /> 
3. Cynthia White, a [[prostitute]] who was later revealed to be a [[police informant]];<br />
4. Albert Magilton, a passerby<br /></blockquote>  

These witnesses testified to the effect that they were at the scene at the time of the shooting, and each identified Abu-Jamal as the person who shot Daniel Faulkner.<ref>{{cite web

This became known as the "running man theory", based on the possibility that a "running man" may have been the actual shooter. Of those witnesses, only Chobert averred to actually witnessing the shooting. He testified that shortly after the shooting he had told police that he had seen Abu-Jamal shoot Daniel Faulkner in the face, and that Abu-Jamal had then run a short distance and collapsed on the sidewalk - himself having also been shot by Faulkner.  In other words, Chobert's testimony was that ''Abu-Jamal himself'' was the running man.<ref>{{cite web

==== "''Hospital bed''" confession ====

Contrary to those witnesses, some witnesses are recorded as having reported that he was completely [[unconscious]] during the time that he was reported to have uttered it.<ref>http://www.freemumia.org/intro.html ''Who is mumia?'' from mumia.org incorporating the statement "Abu-Jamal's doctor said that Abu-Jamal, who was unconscious, said nothing. He reported that a nurse found police with loaded guns pointed at Mumia as he lay unconscious in his hospital bed."</ref> 

The original report of Gary Wakshul, a police officer who confirms to having accompanied him throughout the entire period of his arrest and medical treatment, states that he "made no comment." Officer Wakshul elsewhere later stated that he witnessed Abu-Jamal's utterance of the "hospital bed" confession on the night of the killing, such statement being made almost three months after the arrest and upon the occasion when the [[prosecutor]] met with police seeking to test the evidence about Abu-Jamal's alleged utterance of it. Wakshul is recorded as having reasoned that he "didn't think the confession was important" at the time he wrote his original report.<ref name= "MAJCRD_DVD">{{cite video

=== Witnesses not called at trial ===
{{seealso|Mumia Abu-Jamal legal proceedings#New witnesses}}
Several material and potentially material witnesses were not called to testify at trial. Some were subsequently heard from at Post-Conviction Review Act hearings in the period 1995-7 or otherwise had their statements incorporated into appeal briefs filed on behalf of Abu-Jamal. 

Abu-Jamal did not testify in his own defense. Regarding this he has explained:<blockquote>"At my trial I was denied the [[right]] to [[self-defense|defend myself]]. I had no confidence in my [[public defender|court-appointed attorney]], who never even asked me what happened the night I was shot and the police officer was killed; and I was excluded from at least half the trial. ''Since I was denied all my rights at my trial I did not testify. I would not be used to make it look like I had a fair trial''."<ref>{{cite web

He did not state his version of events for the initial [[police]] [[investigation]], nor for almost another 20 years afterwards until subsequent to his third set of [[lawyer]]s offering the 1999 [[affidavit]] of [[Arnold Beverly]].

On April 24, 2003, Kenneth Pate, the step-brother of Priscilla Durham, swore a declaration incorporating the following relevant content:<blockquote>"I read a newspaper article about the Mumia Abu-Jamal case. It said Priscilla Durham had testified at Abu-Jamal's trial that when she was working as a security guard at the hospital she heard Abu-Jamal say that he had killed the police officer. When I read this I realized it was a different story from what she had told me.” .. [when I asked her] ..
