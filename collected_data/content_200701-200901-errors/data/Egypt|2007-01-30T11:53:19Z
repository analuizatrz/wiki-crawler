'''Egypt''' ([[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]: ''Km.t''&nbsp;; [[Coptic language|Coptic]]: {{Unicode|Ⲭⲏⲙⲓ}} ''Kīmi''&nbsp;; [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: '''<big> مصر </big>''' ''Mi{{unicode|ṣ}}r''&nbsp;; [[Egyptian Arabic]]: ''Má{{unicode|ṣ}}r''), officially  the '''Arab Republic of Egypt''', is a country in [[North Africa]] that includes the [[Sinai Peninsula]], a land bridge to [[Asia]]. Covering an area of about 1,001,450 square kilometers (386,560&nbsp;[[square mile]]s), Egypt [[border]]s [[Libya]] to the west, [[Sudan]] to the south, and [[Israel]] and the [[Gaza Strip]] to the northeast; on the north and the east are the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Red Sea]], respectively.

Egypt is the [[Countries by population|fifteenth most populous country]] in the world. The vast majority of its 78.8 million people (2006)<ref name="Factbook" /> live near the banks of the [[Nile River]] (about 40,000&nbsp;km² or 15,450&nbsp;sq miles) where the only [[arable]] agricultural land is found. Large areas of land form part of the [[Sahara]] [[Desert]] and are sparsely inhabited. Around half of Egypt's residents live in urban areas, with the majority spread across the densely populated centres of greater [[Cairo]] (the largest city in Africa and the Middle East), [[Alexandria]] and other major towns in the [[Nile Delta]].

Egypt is famous for its [[Ancient Egypt|ancient civilization]] and some of the world's most ancient and important monuments, including the [[Giza pyramid complex|Giza Pyramids]] and the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]]; the southern city of [[Luxor]] contains a particularly large number of ancient artifacts such as the [[Karnak]] Temple and the [[Valley of the Kings]]. Today, Egypt is widely regarded as a main political and cultural centre of the [[Middle East]].{{cn}}

== Etymology ==
{{Hiero | ''km.t'' (Egypt) | <hiero>km-m-t:niwt</hiero> | align=right | era=default}}

* One of the ancient [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] names of the country, ''km.t'', or "black land," is derived from the fertile black soils deposited by the Nile floods, distinct from the 'red land' (''dSr.t'') of the desert. The name is realized as ''kīmi'' and ''kīmə'' in the [[Coptic language|Coptic]] stage of the Egyptian language, and appeared in early Greek as ''Kymeía''. 

* ''Mi{{unicode|ṣ}}r'', the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and official name for modern Egypt  ([[Egyptian Arabic]]: ''Ma{{unicode|ṣ}}r''), is of [[Semitic]] origin directly cognate with the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] מִצְרַיִם (''Mitzráyim''), meaning "the two straits" (a reference to the dynastic separation of upper and lower Egypt), and possibly means "a country" or "a state".<ref name="hebrewname">[http://www.ancient-hebrew.org/emagazine/011.html Biblical Hebrew E-Magazine. January, 2005]</ref> ''Mi{{unicode|ṣ}}r'' in Arabic also means "a country" or "a state" or "frontier-land". 

* The English name "Egypt" came via the [[Latin]] word ''Aegyptus'' derived from the [[ancient Greek]] word {{Polytonic|Αίγυπτος}} (''Aigyptos''). According to [[Strabo]], Αίγυπτος (''Aigyptos''), in ancient Greek meant "below the Aegean" ({{Polytonic|Aἰγαίου ὑπτίως}}, "Aegaeou uptiōs"), and was formed by the combination of the two words. It has also been suggested that the word is a corruption of the ancient [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] phrase ''{{unicode|ḥwt-k3-ptḥ}}'' meaning "home of the [[Egyptian soul|Ka]] (Soul) of Ptah", the name of a temple of the god [[Ptah]] at [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]].<ref name="note1">"[http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/kmt.htm The Origin of the word Egypt]", ''by Nermin Sami and Jimmy Dunn".</ref>

== History ==
[[Image:Nile.jpg|thumb|270px|The [[Nile River]] in Egypt.]]
{{main|History of Egypt|Ancient Egypt|Egyptians}}
The [[Nile Valley]] has been a site of continuous human habitation since at least the [[Paleolithic]] era. Traces of these early peoples appear in the form of artifacts and rock carvings along the terraces of the [[Nile]] and in the desert oases. In the [[10th millennium BC]], a [[cereal|grain]]-[[grinding]] [[culture]] using the earliest type of [[sickle]] [[blade]]s had been replaced by another culture of [[hunter-gatherer]]s and [[fishing|fishers]] using [[stone tool]]s. Climate changes and/or overgrazing around 8000 BC began to desiccate the pastoral lands of Egypt, eventually forming the [[Sahara]]. Early tribal peoples migrated to the Nile River where they developed a settled [[agriculture|agricultural]] [[Economic system|economy]] and more centralized [[society]].<ref>Midant-Reynes, Béatrix. ''The Prehistory of Egypt: From the First Egyptians to the First Pharaohs''. Oxford: Blackwell Publishers.</ref> 

By about 6000 BC, organized agriculture and large building construction had appeared in the Nile Valley. During the [[Neolithic]], several [[Predynastic Egypt|predynastic]] cultures developed independently in [[Upper and Lower Egypt]]. The [[Badarian]] culture and the successor [[Naqada]] series are generally regarded as precursors to [[Ancient Egypt|Dynastic Egyptian civilization]]. The earliest known Lower Egyptian site, Merimda, predates the Badarian by about seven hundred years. Contemporaneous Lower Egyptian communities coexisted with their southern counterparts for more than two thousand years, remaining somewhat culturally separate, but maintaining frequent contact through trade. The earliest known evidence of [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|Egyptian hieroglyphic]] inscriptions appear during the predynastic period on [[Naqada]] III pottery vessels, dated to about 3200 BC.<ref>Bard, Kathryn A. Ian Shaw, ed. ''The Oxford Illustrated History of Ancient Egypt''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000. p. 69.</ref> 

{{Hiero | ''tAwy'' ('Two Lands') | <hiero>N16:N16</hiero> | align=left | era=default}}A unified kingdom was founded circa 3150 [[Before Christ|BC]] by King [[Menes]], giving rise to a [[List of Egyptian dynasties|series of dynasties]] that ruled Egypt for the next three millennia. [[Egyptians]] subsequently referred to their unified country as ''tAwy'', meaning 'Two Lands'; and later ''km.t'' ([[Coptic language|Coptic]]: ''Kīmi''), the 'Black Land', a reference to the fertile black soil deposited by the Nile river. [[Culture of Egypt|Egyptian culture]] flourished during this long period and remained distinctively Egyptian in its [[Ancient Egyptian religion|religion]], [[Art of ancient Egypt|arts]], [[Egyptian language|language]] and customs. The [[Protodynastic Period of Egypt|first two ruling dynasties]] of a unified Egypt set the stage for the [[Old Kingdom]] period, c.2700−2200 BC., famous for its many [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]], most notably the [[Third dynasty of Egypt|Third Dynasty]] [[pyramid of Djoser]] and the [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]] [[Giza pyramid complex|Giza Pyramids]].

[[Image:SphinxGiza.jpg|thumb|230px|The [[Great Sphinx of Giza|Great Sphinx]] and the [[Giza pyramid complex|Pyramids of Giza]], built during the [[Old Kingdom]], are modern national icons that also lie at the heart of Egypt's thriving tourism industry.]]
The [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt|First Intermediate Period]] ushered in a time of political upheaval for about 150 years. Stronger Nile floods and stabilization of government, however, brought back renewed prosperity for the country in the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] ''c''. 2040 BC, reaching a peak during the reign of Pharaoh [[Amenemhat III]]. A [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|second period of disunity]] heralded the arrival of the first alien ruling dynasty in Egypt, that of the [[Semitic]] [[Hyksos]]. The Hyksos invaders took over much of Lower Egypt around 1650 BC, and founded a new capital at [[Avaris]]. They were eventually driven out by an Upper Egyptian force led by [[Ahmose I]], who founded the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]] and relocated the capital from [[Memphis]] to [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]].

The [[New Kingdom]] (c.1550−1070 BC) began with the Eighteenth Dynasty, marking the rise of Egypt as an international power that expanded during its greatest extension to an empire as far south as [[Jebel Barkal]] in [[Nubia]], and included parts of the [[Levant]] in the east. This period is known for some of the most well-known [[Pharaoh]]s, including [[Hatshepsut]], [[Thutmose III]], [[Akhenaten]] and his wife [[Nefertiti]], [[Tutankhamun]] and [[Ramesses II]]. The first known self-conscious expression of [[monotheism]] came during this period in the form of [[Atenism]]. Frequent contacts with other nations brought in new ideas in the New Kingdom.

[[Image:Cairo, Old Cairo, Hanging Church, Egypt, Oct 2004.jpg|thumb|170px|left|First built in the third or fourth century AD, the Hanging Church is Cairo's most famous [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] church.]]
The [[Thirtieth dynasty of Egypt|Thirtieth Dynasty]] was the last native ruling dynasty during the Pharaonic epoch. It [[History of Egypt under Achaemenid Persian domination|fell to the Persians]] in 343 BC after the last native pharaoh, King [[Nectanebo II]], was defeated in battle. Later, Egypt fell to the [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Greeks]] and [[Aegyptus (Roman province)|Romans]], beginning over two thousand years of foreign rule. Before Egypt became part of the [[Aegyptus (Roman province)#Byzantine Egypt|Byzantine]] realm, Christianity had been brought by [[Saint Mark the Evangelist]] in the AD first century. [[Diocletian]]'s reign marks the transition from the Roman to the Byzantine era in Egypt, when a great number of Egyptian Christians were persecuted. The [[New Testament]] was by then translated into Egyptian, and after the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in AD 451, a distinct [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Egyptian Coptic Church]] was firmly established.<ref>Kamil, Jill. Coptic Egypt: History and Guide. Cairo: American University in Cairo, 1997. p. 39</ref>

The Byzantines were able to regain control of the country after a brief [[Aegyptus (Roman province)#Persian and Arab conquests|Persian]] invasion early in the seventh century, until in AD 639, Egypt was [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|invaded]] by the [[Muslim]] [[Arabs]]. The form of Islam the Arabs brought to Egypt was [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]], though early in this period Egyptians began to blend their new faith with indigenous beliefs and practices that had survived through Coptic Christianity, giving rise to various [[Sufism|Sufi]] orders that have flourished to this day.<ref>El-Daly, Okasha. ''Egyptology: The Missing Millennium''. London: UCL Press, 2005. p. 140</ref> Muslim rulers nominated by the [[Islamic Caliphate]] [[History of Arab Egypt|remained in control of Egypt]] for the next six centuries, including a period for which it was the seat of the Caliphate under the [[Fatimid]]s. With the end of the [[Ayyubid dynasty]], a [[Turkish people|Turco]]-[[Circassians|Circassian]] military caste, the [[Mamluk]]s, took control about AD 1250 and continued to govern even after the [[History of Ottoman Egypt|conquest of Egypt]] by the [[Ottoman Turks]] in 1517. 

[[Image:Mohammed-ali-basha-mosque.jpg|thumb|230px|Mosque of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Mohamed Ali]] built in the early nineteenth century within the [[Cairo Citadel]].]]
The brief [[French Invasion of Egypt]] led by [[Napoleon I of France|Napolean Bonaparte]] in 1801 had a great social impact on the country and its culture. Native Egyptians became exposed to the principles of the [[French Revolution]] and had an apparent chance to exercise [[self-governance]].<ref>Vatikiotis, P.J. ''The History of Modern Egypt''. 4th edition. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University, 1992, p. 39</ref> A series of civil wars took place between the Ottoman Turks, the Mamluks, and Albanian mercenaries following the evacuation of French troops, resulting in the Albanian [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] (Kavalali Mehmed Ali Pasha) [[Muhammad Ali's seizure of power|taking control of Egypt]] where he was appointed as the Ottoman [[viceroy]] in 1805. He led a modernization campaign of public works, including irrigation projects, agricultural reforms and increased industrialization, which were then taken up and further expanded by his grandson and successor [[Isma'il Pasha]].

Following the completion of the [[Suez Canal]] by Ismail in 1869, Egypt became an important world transportation hub. In 1866, the Assembly of Delegates was founded to serve as an advisory body for the government. Its members were elected from across Egypt and eventually they came to have an important influence on governmental affairs.<ref>Jankowski, James. ''Egypt: A Short History.'' Oxford: Oneworld Publications, 2000. p. 83</ref> The country also fell heavily into debt to European powers. Ostensibly to protect its investments, the [[United Kingdom]] [[Scramble for Africa|seized control]] of Egypt's government in 1882, but nominal allegiance to the [[Ottoman Empire]] continued until 1914 when as a result of the declaration of [[World War I|war with the Ottoman Empire]], Britain declared a [[protectorate]] over Egypt and deposed the [[khedive]], replacing him with [[Husayn Kamil|his uncle]] who was appointed [[Sultan of Egypt]].

[[Image:1919revolution.jpg|thumb|230px|left|Public riot during the 1919 Revolution sparked by the British exile of nationalist leader [[Saad Zaghlul]].]]
Between 1882 and 1906, a local nationalist movement for independence was taking shape. The [[Dinshaway Incident]] prompted Egyptian opposition to take a stronger stand against British occupation and the first political parties were founded. After the first World War, [[Saad Zaghlul]] and the [[Wafd Party]] led the Egyptian nationalist movement after gaining a majority at the local Legislative Assembly. When the British exiled Zaghlul and his associates to [[Malta]] on March 8, 1919, Egypt witnessed its first modern revolution. Constant revolting by the Egyptian people throughout the country led Great Britain to issue a unilateral declaration of Egypt's independence on February 22, 1922.<ref>Jankowski, ''op cit''., p. 112</ref>

The new Egyptian government drafted and implemented a new [[1923 Constitution of Egypt|constitution]] in 1923 based on a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] representative system. Saad Zaghlul was popularly-elected as [[Prime Minister of Egypt]] in 1924, and in 1936 the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936|Anglo-Egyptian Treaty]] was concluded. However, continued instability in the government due to remaining British control and increasing involvement by the King in politics led to the eventual toppling of the monarchy and the dissolution of the parliament through a ''[[coup d'état]]'' by a group of [[Free Officers Movement|army officers]] in 1952. They forced [[King Farouk I]] to abdicate in support of his son [[King Ahmed Fouad II]].

The Egyptian Republic was declared on [[18 June]] [[1953]] with General [[Muhammad Naguib]] as the first President of the Republic. Naguib was forced to resign in 1954 by [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] &ndash; the real architect of the 1952 movement &ndash; and was later put under [[house arrest]]. Nasser assumed [[Political power|power]] as President and declared the full independence of Egypt from the [[United Kingdom]] on [[June 18]] [[1956]]. His [[nationalization]] of the [[Suez Canal]] on [[July 26]] [[1956]] prompted the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]]. Three years after the 1967 [[Six Day War]], in which Egypt lost the [[Sinai]] to [[Israel]], Nasser died and was succeeded by [[Anwar Sadat]]. Sadat switched Egypt's [[Cold War]] allegiance from the [[Soviet Union]] to the [[United States]], expelling Soviet advisors in 1972, and launched the [[Infitah]] economic reform policy, while violently clamping down on religious and secular opposition alike. 

In 1973, Egypt, along with Syria, launched a surprise attack on Israel in an attempt to regain the occupied Sinai Peninsula. Both the [[US]] and the [[USSR]] intervened and a cease-fire was reached between both sides. Despite not being a complete military success, most historians agree that the [[Yom Kippur war]] presented Sadat with a political victory that would later allow him to pursue peace with Israel. In [[1977]], Sadat made a historical visit to Israel which led to the [[1978]] [[Camp David Accords|peace treaty]] in exchange for the complete Israeli withdrawal from Sinai. Sadat's initiative sparked enormous controversy in the Arab world and led to Egypt's expulsion from the Arab League, but was supported by the vast majority of Egyptians.<ref>Vatikiotis, p. 443</ref> Sadat was assassinated in Cairo by a fundamentalist military soldier in [[1981]] and was succeeded by the incumbent [[Hosni Mubarak]]. In 2003, the [[Kifaya|Egyptian Movement for Change]], popularly known as ''Kifaya'', was launched to seek a return to [[democracy]] and greater [[civil liberties]].

:{{main|Politics of Egypt}}
===National===
[[Image:presoffice.jpg|thumb|left|260px|The Office of the [[President of Egypt]] at the [[Presidential Palace]].]]
Egypt has been a republic since [[18 June]] [[1953]]. President [[Hosni Mubarak|Mohamed Hosni Mubarak]] has been the [[President of Egypt|President of the Republic]] since [[October 14]] [[1981]], following the assassination of former-President [[Anwar Sadat|Mohammed Anwar El-Sadat]]. Mubarak is currently serving his fifth term in office. He is the leader of the ruling [[National Democratic Party (Egypt)|National Democratic Party]]. [[Heads of government of Egypt|Prime Minister]] Dr. [[Ahmed Nazif]] was sworn in as Prime Minister on [[9 July]] [[2004]], following the resignation of Dr. [[Atef Ebeid]] from his office.

Although power is ostensibly organized under a [[Multi-party system|multi-party]] [[semi-presidential system]], whereby the executive power is theoretically divided between the President and the [[Prime Minister of Egypt|Prime Minister]], in practice it rests almost solely with the President who traditionally has been elected in single-candidate elections for more than fifty years. Egypt also holds regular multi-party parliamentary elections. The last presidential election, in which Mubarak won a fifth consecutive term, [[Egyptian presidential election, 2005|was held in September 2005]].

In late February 2005, President Mubarak announced in a surprise television broadcast that he had ordered the reform of the country's presidential election law, paving the way for multi-candidate polls in the upcoming presidential election. For the first time since the [[Free Officers Movement|1952 movement]], the Egyptian people had an apparent chance to elect a leader from a list of various candidates. The President said his initiative came "out of my full conviction of the need to consolidate efforts for more freedom and democracy."<ref>Business TodayEGYPT. [http://www.businesstodayegypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=4565 Mubarak throws presidential race wide open]. March 2005.</ref> However, the new law placed draconian restrictions on the filing for presidential candidacies, designed to prevent well-known candidates such as [[Ayman Nour]] from standing against Mubarak, and paved the road for his easy re-election victory.<ref>Lavin, Abigail.

March 27, 2006.</ref> 

[[Image:parli.gif|thumb|250px|The [[Parliament of Egypt|Egyptian Parliament]].]]
Concerns were once again expressed after the 2005 presidential elections about government interference in the election process through fraud and vote-rigging, in addition to police brutality and violence by pro-Mubarak supporters against opposition demonstrators.<ref>Murphy, Dan. [http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0526/p06s01-wome.html Egyptian vote marred by violence]. Christian Science Monitor. May 26, 2995.</ref> This poses major questions about the government's purported commitment to democracy.

As a result, most Egyptians are skeptical about the process of [[democratization]] and the role of the elections. Less than 25 percent of the country's 32 million registered voters (out of a population of more than 78 million) actually turned out for the 2005 elections.<ref>Gomez, Edward M.

September 13, 2005.</ref> Newspapers, however, have exhibited an increasing degree of freedom in criticizing the president, and the results of the [[Egyptian parliamentary election, 2005|2005 parliamentary elections]], which saw [[Islamism|Islamist]] candidates such as the banned [[Muslim Brotherhood]] winning seats, indicate that a change of some sorts may be underway. A proposed change to the constitution would limit the president to two seven-year terms in office.<ref>[http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2006/12/egypt-to-begin-process-of-lifting.php Egypt to begin process of lifting emergency laws].

===Human rights===

[[Image:Kefaya demo.jpg|thumb|230px|left|Members of the [[Kifaya]] democracy movement protesting a fifth term for President [[Hosni Mubarak]].]]Several local and international human rights organizations, including [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]], have reported on Egypt's poor human rights record for many years. In 2005, the government of President [[Hosni Mubarak]] faced unprecedented public criticism when it clamped down on [[Kifaya|democracy activists]] challenging his rule. Some of the most serious human rights violations according to HRW's 2006 report on Egypt are routine torture, arbitrary detentions and trials before military and state security courts.<ref name="HRW">Human Rights Watch.

Discriminatory personal status laws governing marriage, divorce, custody and inheritance which put women at a disadvantage have also been cited. Laws concerning [[Copt|Christians]] which place restrictions on church building have been recently eased, but major constructions still require governmental approval.<ref>[http://www.wwrn.org/article.php?idd=19813&sec=36&cont=3 Church Building Regulations Eased]</ref> In addition, intolerance of Baha'is and unorthodox Muslim sects remains a problem.<ref name="HRW" />

Denying a basic right of religious belief, the high court of Egypt has outlawed all religions and belief except Islam, Christianity and Judaism. (For more information see [[Egyptian Identification Card Controversy]]).

===Foreign relations===
:{{main|Foreign relations of Egypt}}

Egypt's foreign policy operates along a non-aligned level. Factors such as population size, historical events, military strength, diplomatic expertise and a strategic geographical position give Egypt extensive political influence in the Middle East and Africa, and within the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] as a whole. Cairo has been a crossroads of regional commerce and culture for centuries, and its intellectual and Islamic institutions are at the center of the region's social and cultural development.

The permanent headquarters for the [[Arab League Headquarters|League of Arab States]] (The Arab League) is located in Cairo. The Secretary General of the League has traditionally been an Egyptian. Former Egyptian Foreign Minister [[Amr Moussa]] is the current Secretary General of the Arab League. The Arab League briefly moved out of Egypt to Tunis in 1978 as a protest at the peace treaty with Israel, but returned in 1989.

Egypt was the first Arab state to establish diplomatic relations with the state of Israel, after the signing of the [[Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty]] at the [[Camp David Accords (1978)|Camp David Accords]]. Egypt has a major influence amongst other Arab states, and has historically played an important role as a mediator in resolving disputes between various Arab nations, and in the Israeli-Palestinian dispute. Most Arab nations still give credence to Egypt playing that role, though its effects are often limited.

Former Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] served as Secretary General of the [[United Nations]] from 1991 to 1996.

== Military ==
{{main|Military of Egypt}}

[[Image:egyptf16.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Egyptian F-16s flying in close formation]]The Egyptian military is one of the largest military powers on the African continent, and the second strongest in the Middle East after Israel. The Egyptian Armed forces have also had more battle-field experience than most armies in the region, with a combined troop strength of around 450,000 active personnel.<ref>[http://www.globalfirepower.com/country_detail.asp?country_id=12 Egypt Military Strength]</ref> The Egyptian military has recently undergone massive military modernization mostly in their Air Force. Egypt is currently the only Arab and African country with a [[Spy satellite]], [[EgyptSat 1]].<ref>Katz, Yaacov.

The Egyptian government recently requested a batch of advanced F-15 fighters from the United States equipped with "smart" bombs to expand its Air Defense capability. Israel is trying to block the sale of the F-15 fighters because of concern that this would completely close the gap between the Egyptian and Israeli Air Forces.<ref>Jewish Virtual Library. [http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Threats_to_Israel/Egypt.html Potential Threats To Israel: Egypt]. 2007.</ref> According to the Israeli chair of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, Yuval Steinitz, the [[Egyptian Air Force]] has roughly the same number of modern warplanes as the [[Israeli Air Force]] and far more Western tanks, artillery, anti-aircraft batteries and warships than the [[IDF]].<ref>Steinitz, Yuval. [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/795822.html Not the peace we expected]. Haaretz. December 05, 2006.</ref>

Egypt continues to contribute regularly to [[United Nations]] peacekeeping missions, most recently in [[East Timor]], [[Sierra Leone]], and [[Liberia]]. [[Conscription#Egypt|Conscription]] is compulsory for Egyptian men of 18 years of age who are not the only male child. Full-time students may defer their service until the age of 28. The length of the service depends on the level and kind of education achieved by the conscript and needs of the army at the time of conscription.

== Economy ==
[[Image:Cairo.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Lions guard the Kasr-el-Nil Bridge which traverses the [[Nile]] at Tahrir Square. The construction of the bridge served as a catalyst for the development of the affluent commercial district [[Zamalek]] (Gezira Island).]]
{{main|Economy of Egypt}}
Egypt's economy depends mainly on agriculture, media, petroleum exports, and tourism; there are also more than five million Egyptians working abroad, mainly in Saudi Arabia, the [[Persian Gulf]] and [[Europe]]. The [[United States]] as well has a large population of Egyptian immigrants.

The completion of the [[Aswan High Dam]] in 1971 and the resultant [[Lake Nasser]] have altered the time-honored place of the Nile River in the [[agriculture]] and ecology of Egypt. A rapidly-growing population (the largest in the Arab world), limited arable land, and dependence on the Nile all continue to overtax resources and stress the economy.

The government has struggled to prepare the economy for the new millennium through economic reform and massive investments in communications and physical infrastructure. Egypt has been receiving  U.S. [[foreign aid]] (since 1979, an average of $2.2 billion per year) and is the third-largest recipient of such funds from the United States following the Iraq war. Its main revenues however come from tourism as well as traffic that goes through the [[Suez Canal]].

Economic conditions are starting to improve considerably after a period of stagnation from the adoption of more liberal economic policies by the government, as well as increased revenues from tourism and a booming stock market. In its annual report, the [[IMF]] has rated Egypt as one of the top countries in the world undertaking economic reforms.

== Demographics ==
[[Image:Egyptian farm.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Egyptian farm.]]
{{main|Demographics of Egypt|Egyptians}}
Egypt is the most populous country in the [[Middle East]] and the second-most populous on the [[Africa]]n continent, with nearly 79 million people. Almost all the population is concentrated along the banks of the Nile (notably Alexandria and Cairo), in the Delta and near the Suez Canal. Approximately 90% of the population adheres to [[Islam in Egypt|Islam]] and most of the remainder to Christianity (primarily the [[Coptic Orthodox]] denomination).<ref name="Factbook">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/eg.html#People|title=Egyptian people section from the World Factbook|work=[[World Fact Book]]|accessdate=2007-01-29}}</ref>  Apart from religious affiliation, Egyptians can be divided demographically into those who live in the major urban centers and the [[fellah]]in or farmers of rural villages.

[[Egyptians]] are by the far the largest ethnic group in Egypt at 97-98% (about 76.4 million) of the total population.<ref name="Factbook" /> Ethnic minorities include the [[Bedouin]] Arab tribes living in the eastern deserts and the [[Sinai Peninsula]], the [[Berber language|Berber]]-speaking [[Siwis]] of the [[Siwa Oasis]], and the ancient [[Nubian]] communities clustered along the Nile in the southernmost part of Egypt. Egypt also hosts some 90,000 refugees and asylum seekers, made up mostly of 70,000 [[Palestinian refugee]]s and 20,000 [[Sudanese refugees in Egypt|Sudanese refugees]]. The once-vibrant [[History of the Jews in Egypt|Jewish]] community in Egypt has virtually [[Jewish exodus from Arab lands|disappeared]], with only a small number remaining in Egypt and those who visit on religious occasions. Several important Jewish archaeological and historical sites remain.

== Religion ==
[[Image:Cairo_mosques.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Cairo's unique city scape with its ancient mosques]]
{{main|Religion in Egypt}}
Religion plays a central role in most Egyptians' lives, as visitors to the country quickly discover. The [[Adhan|rolling calls to prayer]] that are heard five times a day have the informal effect of regulating the pace of everything from business to entertainment. Cairo is famous for its numerous mosque [[minaret]]s and church towers. Unfortunately, this religious landscape has been marred by a long-standing record of relgious extremism,<ref name="us_dos_egypt">{{cite web | title = Egypt: International Religious Freedom Report | date = 2004-09-15 | author = U.S. Department of State | publisher = Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor | url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2004/35496.htm | accessdate = 2006-10-20}}</ref> most recently typified in a 16 December 2006 judgment of the [[high court|Supreme Administative Council]] of Egypt which has insisted on a clear demarcation between "recognized religions"—Islam, Christianity and Judaism—and all other religious beliefs—thus effectively delegitimatizing and forbidding practice of all but these aforementioned religions.<ref name="eipr2">{{cite web | title =  Government Must Find Solution for Baha'i Egyptians | date = 2006-12-16 | accessdate = 2006-12-16 | author = Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights | publisher = eipr.org | url = http://www.eipr.org/en/press/06/1612.htm}}</ref>  This judgment has lead to the requirement for communities to either commit perjury or be subjected to [[egyptian identification card controversy|denial of identification cards]] which is tantamount to the denial of their right to citizenship.

Egypt is predominantly Muslim, at approximately 90% of the population, with the majority being adherents of the [[Sunni]] branch of Islam.<ref name="Factbook" /> A significant number of Muslim Egyptians also follow native [[Sufism|Sufi]] [[Tariqah|orders]].<ref>Hoffman, Valerie J. ''Sufism, Mystics, and Saints in Modern Egypt''. University of South Carolina Press, 1995.</ref> Christians represent about 10% of the population, 90% of whom belong to the native [[Copts|Coptic]] denominations (primarily [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]], but also [[Coptic Catholic Church]] and [[Coptic Evangelical Church]]), while the remainder include [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria]], [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox of Antioch]], and [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] and some Uniate Catholic Churches such as the Maronite, Chaldean, Syriac Catholic and Armenian Catholic Churches, largely found in [[Alexandria]] and [[Cairo]].<ref name="Factbook" />

According to the [[Constitution of Egypt|constitution]], any new legislation must implicitly agree with [[Sharia|Islamic laws]]. The mainstream [[Hanafi]] school of [[Sunni]] Islam is largely organised by the state, through ''Wizaret Al-Awkaf'' (Ministry of Religious Affairs). ''Al-Awkaf'' controls all mosques and overviews Muslim clerics. [[Imams]] are trained in Imam vocational schools and at [[Al-Azhar University]]. The department supports Sunni Islam and has commissions authorised to give ''[[Fatwa]]'' judgements on Islamic issues.

Egypt hosts two major religious institutions. [[Al-Azhar University]] (Arabic: جامعة الأزهر) is the oldest [[Islam|Islamic]] institution of higher studies (founded around 970 [[A.D]]) and considered by many to be the oldest extant university. Egypt also has a strong Christian heritage as evidenced by the existence of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox Church]] headed by the [[Patriarch of Alexandria]], which has a following of approximately 50 million Christians worldwide, most importantly in [[Ethiopia]], [[Syria]] and [[Eritrea]].

[[Image:monastry3.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Over seven million Egyptians follow the [[Christianity|Christian]] faith as members of the [[Coptic Church]].]]Religious freedom for Egypt's [[Copts|Coptic Christian]] community is hampered to varying degrees by extremist [[Islamism|Islamist]] groups and by discriminatory and restrictive government policies. Until recently, [[Christians]] were required to obtain presidential approval for even minor repairs in churches. Although the law was recently eased by handing down the authority of approval to the governors, [[Copts]] continue to face many obstacles in building new or repairing existing churches.<ref>WorldWide Religious News.

That however changed to some degree when President [[Sadat]] appointed [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]], as the Egyptian Foreign Minister.

In addition, [[Naguib Sawiris]], an extremely successful businessman and one of the wealthiest people internationally is a [[Copts|Copt]].

Egypt was once home to one of the oldest Jewish communities in the world. Jews partook of all aspects of Egypt's social and political life; one of the most ardent Egyptian nationalists, Yaqub Sanu' (Abu Naddara), was a Jew, as was popular singer [[Leila Mourad]]. After the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]], some 25,000 Jews were expelled by [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], many with Egyptian citizenship. Their Egyptian citizenship was revoked and their property was confiscated. A steady stream of migration of Egyptian Jews followed, reaching a peak after the [[Six-Day War]] with Israel in 1967. Today, Jews in Egypt number less than 200.<ref>Jewish Community Council (JCC) of Cairo. [http://www.geocities.com/RainForest/Vines/5855/bassa20.htm Bassatine News]. 2006.</ref>

[[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] in Egypt, whose population ranges between several hundred and a few thousand, have long been [[Persecution of Bahá'ís#Egypt|persecuted]], having their institutions and community activities banned. Since their faith is not officially recognized by the state, they are also not allowed to use it on their national [[Egyptian identification card controversy|identity cards]] (conversely, Islam, Christianity, & Judaism are officially recognized); hence most of them do not hold national identity cards. In April 2006 a court case recognized the Bahá'í Faith, but the government appealed the court decision and succeeded in having it suspended on 15 May.<ref name="note9">"[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/IRIN/00d003de7250ad6560e7b65ceae6fd20.htm EGYPT: Court suspends ruling recognising Bahai rights]", ''Reuters AlertNet'', 16 May 2006.</ref> On [[December 16]], [[2006]], only after one hearing, the Supreme Administrative Council of Egypt ruled against the Bahá'ís and stating that the government may not recognize the Bahá'í Faith in official identification numbers.<ref name="eipr2">{{cite web | title =  Government Must Find Solution for Baha'i Egyptians | date = 2006-12-16 | accessdate = 2006-12-16 | author = Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights | publisher = eipr.org | url = http://www.eipr.org/en/press/06/1612.htm}}</ref> 

There are Egyptians who identify as [[atheist]] and [[agnostic]], but their numbers are largely unknown as openly advocating such positions risks legal sanction. In 2000, an openly atheist Egyptian writer, who called for the establishment of a local association for atheists, was tried on charges of insulting Islam in four of his books.<ref name="note6">{{cite news |first=Jailan |last=Halawi |pages= |title=Limits to expression |date=21-27 December 2000 |publisher=Al-Ahram Weekly |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2000/513/eg7.htm}}</ref>

== Geography ==
[[Image:WhiteD1.jpg|left|200px|thumb|White Desert, [[Farafra, Egypt|Farafra]].]]
{{main|Geography of Egypt}}
At 386,636&nbsp;[[square miles|mi²]] (1,001,450&nbsp;[[square kilometre|km²]] <ref>[https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/rankorder/2147rank.html World Factbook area rank order]</ref>), Egypt is the world's thirtieth-largest country (after [[Mauritania]]). It is comparable in size to [[Tanzania]], twice the size of [[France]], four times the size of the [[UK]], and is more than half the size of the US state of [[Alaska]].

Nevertheless, due to the aridity of Egypt's climate, population centres are concentrated along the narrow Nile Valley and Delta, meaning that approximately 99% of the population uses only about 5.5% of the total land area.<ref> [http://www.iasonnet.gr/abstracts/hamza.html]</ref>

Egypt is bordered by [[Libya]] on the west, [[Sudan]] on the south, and by [[Israel]] and the Palestinian [[Gaza Strip]] on the northeast. Egypt's important role in geopolitics stems from its strategic position: a [[transcontinental nation]], it possesses a land bridge (the Isthmus of Suez) between [[Africa]] and [[Asia]], which in turn is traversed by a navigable waterway (the [[Suez Canal]]) that connects the Mediterranean Sea with the [[Indian Ocean]] via the [[Red Sea]]. 

Apart from the Nile Valley, the majority of Egypt's landscape is a big, sandy desert. The winds blowing can create sand dunes over one hundred feet high. Egypt includes parts of the [[Sahara Desert]] and of the [[Libyan Desert]]. These deserts were referred to as the "red land" in ancient Egypt, and they protected the Kingdom of the Pharaohs from western threats.

Towns and cities include [[Alexandria]], one of the greatest ancient cities, [[Aswan]], [[Asyut]], [[Cairo]], the modern Egyptian capital, [[El-Mahalla El-Kubra]], [[Giza]], the site of the Pyramid of Khufu, [[Hurghada]], [[Luxor]], [[Kom Ombo]], [[Port Safaga]], [[Port Said]], [[Sharm el Sheikh]], [[Suez]], where the Suez Canal is located, [[Zagazig]], and [[Al-Minya]]. [[Oasis|Oases]] include [[Bahariya Oasis|Bahariya]], [[Dakhla Oasis|el Dakhla]], [[Farafra, Egypt|Farafra]], [[Kharga Oasis|el Kharga]] and [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]]. 
{{MapLibrary|Egypt_sat.png|Egypt}}

[[Protectorates]] include Ras Mohamed National Park, Zaranik Protectorate and Siwa. See [[Egyptian Protectorates]] for more information.

===Climate===
Egypt has a dry climate. It is hot in the summer, with temperatures averaging between 80 and 90°F(27 - 32°C). Winters are warm, with temperatures averaging between 55 and 70°F(13 - 21°C). A steady wind from the northwest helps hold down the temperature near the coast. The [[Khamaseen]] is a wind that blows from the south in Egypt, usually in spring or summer, bringing sand and dust, and sometimes raises the temperature in the desert to more than 100°F(38°C). Rain seldom falls in Egypt. Along the Mediterranean Coast, the average yearly rainfall is 8 inches(20cm). Farther south, only about one inch of rain falls every year.
During winter snow falls on Sinai's mountains and some coastal cities, such as: Baltim, Damiatta, Sidi Barrany and Alexandria.

== Culture ==
[[Image:LibraryAlexandria1-Omar.jpg|thumb|270px|left|[[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]] is a commemoration of the ancient [[Library of Alexandria]] in Egypt's second largest city.]]
{{main|Culture of Egypt}}
[[Culture of Egypt|Egyptian culture]] has five thousand years of recorded history. [[Ancient Egypt]] was among the earliest [[civilization]]s and for millennia, Egypt maintained a strikingly complex and stable culture that influenced later cultures of [[Europe]], the [[Middle East]] and [[Africa]]. After the Pharaonic era, Egypt itself came under the influence of [[Hellenism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]]ic culture. Today, many aspects of Egypt's ancient culture exist in interaction with newer elements, including the influence of modern [[Western culture]], itself with roots in ancient Egypt. 

Egypt's capital city, Cairo, is Africa's largest city and has been renowned for centuries as a center of learning, culture and commerce. Egypt has the highest number of [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel Laureates]] in Africa and the Arab World. Some Egyptian born politicians were or are currently at the helm of major international organizations like [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] of the [[United Nations]] and [[Mohamed ElBaradei]] of the [[IAEA]].

====Renaissance====
The work of early nineteenth-century scholar Rifa'a et-Tahtawi gave rise to the Egyptian Renaissance, marking the transition from [[History of Ottoman Egypt|Medieval]] to [[History of Modern Egypt|Early Modern]] Egypt. His work renewed interest in [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian antiquity]] and exposed Egyptian society to [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] principles. Tahtawi co-founded with education reformer [[Ali Mubarak]] a native [[Egyptology]] school that looked for inspiration to medieval Egyptian scholars, such as [[Suyuti]] and [[Maqrizi]], who themselves studied the [[History of ancient Egypt|history]], [[Egyptian language|language]] and [[Ancient Egyptian architecture|antiquities]] of Egypt.<ref>El-Daly, ''op cit''., p. 29</ref> Egypt's renaissance peaked in the late 19th and early 20th centuries through the work of people like [[Muhammad Abduh]], Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed, [[Qasim Amin]], [[Salama Moussa]], [[Taha Hussein]] and [[Mahmoud Mokhtar]]. They forged a [[liberalism|liberal]] path for Egypt expressed as a commitment to individual freedom, [[secularism]] and faith in science to bring progress.<ref>Jankowski, ''op cit''., p. 130</ref>

====Arts====
[[Image:Maler der Grabkammer des Ramose 002.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth dynasty]] painting from the tomb of [[Thebes, Egypt|Theban]] governor [[Ramose]] in [[Deir el-Madinah]]]]The Egyptians were one of the first major civilizations to codify design elements in art. The wall paintings done in the service of the [[Pharaoh]]s followed a rigid code of visual rules and meanings. Modern and contemporary Egyptian art can be as diverse as any works in the world art scene. The [[Cairo Opera House]] serves as the main performing arts venue in the Egyptian capital. Egypt's media and arts industry has flourished since the late nineteenth century, today with more than thirty satellite channels and over one hundred motion pictures produced each year. Cairo has long been known as the "Hollywood of the Middle East;" its annual film festival, the [[Cairo International Film Festival]], has been rated as one of 11 festivals with a top class rating worldwide by the International Federation of Film Producers' Associations.<ref>[http://www.ukhotmovies.com/film-festivals/cairo-film-festival/information.html Cairo Film Festival information].</ref> To bolster its media industry further, especially with the keen competition from the [[Persian Gulf Arab States]] and [[Lebanon]], a large media city was built. Some Egyptian actors, like [[Omar Sharif]], have achieved worldwide fame.

====Literature====
[[Literature]] constitutes an important cultural element in the life of Egypt. Egyptian novelists and poets were among the first to experiment with modern styles of Arabic literature, and the forms they developed have been widely imitated throughout the Middle East. The first modern Egyptian novel ''[[Zaynab (novel)|Zaynab]]'' by [[Muhammad Husayn Haykal]] was published in [[1913]] in the [[Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian vernacular]].<ref>Vatikiotis, ''op cit''.</ref> Egyptian novelist [[Naguib Mahfouz]] was the first Arabic-language writer to win the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. Vernacular poetry is perhaps the most popular literary genre amongst Egyptians, represented by such luminaries as Ahmed Fuad Nigm (Fagumi), [[Salah Jaheen]] and [[Abdel Rahman el-Abnudi]].


====Music====
[[Image:Egyptian musicians.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Upper Egyptian folk musicians from [[Kom Ombo]].]]
{{main|Music of Egypt}}
[[Music of Egypt|Egyptian music]] is a rich mixture of indigenous, Mediterranean, African and Western elements. In [[Ancient Egypt|antiquity]], Egyptians were playing harps and flutes, including two indigenous instruments: the [[ney]] and the [[oud]]. [[Percussion]] and vocal music also became an important part of the local music tradition ever since. Contemporary Egyptian music traces its beginnings to the creative work of people such as Abdu-l Hamuli, Almaz and Mahmud Osman, who influenced the later work of Egyptian music giants such as [[Sayed Darwish]], [[Umm Kulthum]], [[Mohammed Abdel Wahab]] and [[Abdel Halim Hafez]]. From the 1970s onwards, Egyptian pop music has become increasingly important in Egyptian culture, while Egyptian folk music continues to be played during weddings and other festivities.

====Festivals====
Egypt is famous for its many festivals and religious carnivals, also known as ''mulids''. They are usually associated with a particular [[Copt]]ic or [[Sufism|Sufi]] saint, but are often celebrated by all Egyptians irrespective of creed or religion. [[Ramadan]] has a special flavor in Egypt, celebrated with sounds, lights (local lanterns known as ''fawanees'') and much flare that many Muslim tourists from the region flock to Egypt during Ramadan to witness the spectacle. The ancient spring festival of Sham en Nisim ([[Coptic language|Copto]]-[[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]: {{Unicode|Ϭⲱⲙ‘ⲛⲛⲓⲥⲓⲙ}} ''shom en nisim'') has been celebrated by Egyptians for thousands of years, typically between the [[Egyptian calendar|Egyptian months]] of Baramouda (April) and Bashans (May) following Easter Sunday.<ref>Bizzari, Heba Fatteen. [http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/shamelnaseen.htm Sham el Nessim: Egypt Spring Festival]. Tour Egypt.</ref>

====Sports====
[[Football (soccer)]] is the ''de facto'' [[national sport]] of Egypt. Egyptian Soccer clubs [[Al-Ahly|El Ahly]] and [[El Zamalek]] are the two most popular teams and enjoy the reputation of long-time champions of the sport regionally. [[Squash (sport)|Squash]] and [[tennis]] are other close favorites among Egyptians. The Egyptian Squash team has been known for its fierce competition in world-wide championships since 1930s.
