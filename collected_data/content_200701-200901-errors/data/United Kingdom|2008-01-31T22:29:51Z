{{Main|History of the United Kingdom}}

[[Image:Sadler, Battle of Waterloo.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Battle of Waterloo]] marked the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].]]

[[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] had existed as separate sovereign and independent states with their own [[monarchs]] and political structures since the 9th century. The once independent [[Principality of Wales]] fell under the control of English monarchs from the [[Statute of Rhuddlan]] in 1284. Under the [[Acts of Union 1707]], England (including Wales) and Scotland, which had been in [[personal union]] since the [[Union of the Crowns]] in 1603, agreed to a political union in the form of a unified [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://personal.pitnet.net/primarysources/act.html |title=The Treaty (or Act) of Union, 1707 |publisher= |accessdate=2006-05-15}}</ref>
The [[Act of Union 1800]] united the Kingdom of Great Britain with the [[Kingdom of Ireland]], which had been gradually brought under English control between 1541 and [[Treaty of Limerick|1691]], to form the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] in 1801.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.actofunion.ac.uk/actofunion.htm#act | title=The Act of Union |publisher=Act of Union Virtual Library |accessdate=2006-05-15}}</ref> Independence for the [[Irish Free State]] in 1922 followed the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920|partition]] of the island of Ireland two years previously, with six of the nine [[Counties of Ireland|counties]] of the [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Ulster]] remaining within the UK, which then [[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927|changed]] to the current name in 1927 of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.<ref name="CAIN">{{cite web |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/politics/docs/ait1921.htm |title=The Anglo-Irish Treaty, [[6 December]] [[1921]] |publisher=CAIN |accessdate=2006-05-15}}</ref>

Britain played an important part in the [[Age of Enlightenment]] with [[philosophy|philosophical]] and [[science|scientific]] input and a [[literary]] and [[theatrical]] tradition. Over the next century the United Kingdom played an important role in developing [[Western world|Western]] ideas of [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] with significant contributions to [[literature]], the [[arts]] and [[science]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Ferguson |first=Niall |authorlink=Niall Ferguson |year=2003 |title=Empire: The Rise and Demise of the British World Order |publisher=Basic Books |id=ISBN 0-465-02328-2}}</ref> The UK-led [[Industrial Revolution]] transformed the country and fuelled the [[British Empire]]. During this time, like other [[Great Powers]], the UK was involved in colonial exploitation, including the [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]], while the passing of the 1807 [[Slave Trade Act 1807|Slave Trade Act]] also made the UK the first nation to prohibit trade in slaves.

[[Image:British Empire 1897.jpg|thumb|left|The [[British Empire]] in 1897]]

After the defeat of [[Napoleon]] in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Britain became the principal naval power of the 19th century. At its peak the [[British Empire]] controlled large amounts of territory in Asia, Africa, Oceania and America.

In the 19th century, the country played an important role in the development of [[parliamentary democracy]], partly through the emergence of a multi-party system. At the end of the [[Victorian era]] the United Kingdom lost its industrial leadership, particularly to the [[German Empire]], which surpassed the UK in industrial production and trade in the 1890s, and to the [[United States]]. Britain remained an eminent power and its empire expanded to its maximum size by 1921, gaining the [[League of Nations]] mandate over former German and Ottoman colonies after World War I.

After [[World War I]], the world's first large-scale international broadcasting network, the [[BBC]], was created. In 1924 the country's [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour movement]], which had been gaining strength since the late 1890s, formed the [[First Labour Government (UK)|first Labour government]]. Britain fought [[Nazi Germany]] in [[World War II]], with its [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] allies including [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]] and [[India]], later to be joined by further [[Allies of World War II|allies]] such as the United States. Wartime leader [[Winston Churchill]] and his peacetime successor [[Clement Atlee]] helped create the post-war world as part of the "Big Three". World War II left the United Kingdom financially damaged. [[Loans]] taken out during and after World War II from both Canada and the United States were economically costly but, along with post-war [[Marshall Plan|Marshall aid]], the UK began the road to recovery.

The immediate post-war years saw the establishment of the British [[Welfare State]] and one of the world's first and most comprehensive public [[National Health Service|health services]], while the demands of a recovering economy brought people from all over the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] to create a [[multi-ethnic]] Britain. Although the new post-war limits of Britain's [[political]] role were confirmed by the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956, the international spread of the [[English language|language]] meant the continuing impact of its literature and [[culture]], while at the same time from the 1960s its [[popular culture]] found influence abroad. Following a period of economic stagnation and industrial strife in the 1970s after a global economic downturn, the 1980s saw the inflow of substantial [[North Sea Oil|oil revenues]], and the premiership of [[Margaret Thatcher]], under whom there was a marked break with the post-war political and economic consensus. Her supporters credit her with economic success, but her critics blame her for greater social division. From 1997 onward, these trends of growth largely continued under the leadership of [[Tony Blair]].

The United Kingdom has been a member of the [[European Union]] since 1973. The attitude of the present [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government towards further integration with this organisation is mixed,<ref name=Times>{{cite web |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,17129-1948441,00.html |title=Modest progress but always on back foot |publisher=Times Online |date=[[2005-12-21]] |accessdate=2006-05-16}}</ref> with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] favouring a return of some powers and competencies to the state,<ref name=Conservatives>{{cite web |url=http://www.conservatives.com/tile.do?def=europe.news.campaigns.display.page&obj_id=73417 |title=European Constitution: bad for Britain, bad for Europe |publisher=Conservative Party |accessdate=2006-05-23}}</ref> and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] supportive of current engagement.

The end of the 20th century witnessed a major change to the government of the United Kingdom with [[devolution]] to [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] taking effect in 1999. The creation of the devolved [[Scottish parliament]] in particular, with powers to legislate over a wide range of issues, is beginning to add to differences between the [[constituent countries]] of the United Kingdom.  It has also brought to the fore the so-called [[West Lothian question]] which is a complaint that devolution for Scotland and Wales but not England has created a situation where all the MPs in the UK parliament can vote on matters affecting England alone but on those same matters Scotland and Wales can make their own decisions.  In 2007, the [[SNP]] won the [[Scottish Parliament Election, 2007|Scottish parliament elections]] and formed a [[minority government]]. New [[First Minister]], [[Alex Salmond]], hopes to hold a referendum on [[Scottish Independence]] before 2011, though the SNP may be unable to get a Bill to hold such a referendum approved by the Scottish parliament due to the minority position of the SNP government. If a referendum is held, an opinion poll in late 2007 suggested the result could be close as support for independence had reached 40% with just 44% supporting retention of the Union.<ref>[http://www.sundayherald.com/news/heraldnews/display.var.1907907.0.0.php Sunday Herald, December 2007, 40% of Scots now support Independence]</ref>

== Government and politics ==
{{Main|Politics of the United Kingdom|Monarchy of the United Kingdom}}
[[Image:Elizabeth II greets NASA GSFC employees, May 8, 2007 edit.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]]]

The United Kingdom is a [[constitutional monarchy]] with [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]], [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], as head of state; the monarch of the UK also serves as head of state of [[Commonwealth realm|fifteen other Commonwealth countries]], putting the UK in a [[personal union]] with those other states. The UK has a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary government]] based on strong democratic traditions: the [[Westminster system]] has been emulated around the world — a legacy of the [[British Empire]].

[[Constitution of the United Kingdom|The UK's constitution]] governs the legal framework of the country and consists mostly of written sources, including [[statute]]s, judge made [[case law]], and international treaties. As there is no technical difference between ordinary statutes and [[law]] considered to be "constitutional law," the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] can perform "constitutional reform" simply by passing [[Acts of Parliament]] and thus has the [[political power|power]] to change or abolish almost any written or unwritten element of the constitution. However, no Parliament can pass laws that future Parliaments cannot change.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/laws/sovereignty.cfm|title=Official UK Parliament web page on parliamentary sovereignty}}</ref> The United Kingdom is one of the three countries in the world today that does not have a codified [[constitution]] (the other two being [[New Zealand]] and [[Israel]]).<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.llrx.com/features/uk2.htm#UK%20Legal%20System |title=A Guide To the UK Legal System |author=Sarah Carter |publisher=[[University of Kent|University of Kent at Canterbury]] |accessdate=2006-05-16}}</ref>

The position of [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], the UK's [[head of government]], belongs to the [[List of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom|current leader]] of the political party that can obtain the confidence of a plurality in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. The Prime Minister and their Cabinet are formally appointed by the Monarch to form [[Her Majesty's Government]]. However, the Prime Minister chooses the Cabinet, and by convention, the Queen respects the Prime Minister's choices. The [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] is traditionally drawn from members of the Prime Minister's party in both legislative houses, and mostly from the House of Commons, to which [[Responsible government|they are responsible]]. Executive power is exercised by the Prime Minister and Cabinet, all of whom are sworn into [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council]], and become [[Minister of the Crown|Ministers of the Crown]]. [[Gordon Brown]], leader of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], has been Prime Minister, [[First Lord of the Treasury]] and [[Minister for the Civil Service]] since [[27 June]] [[2007]].

The [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] is the legislature of the United Kingdom; housed in the [[Palace of Westminster]], it is the ultimate legislative authority in the UK, according to the doctrine of [[parliamentary sovereignty]]. However, questions over sovereignty have been brought forward due to the UK's membership within the [[European Union]].<ref name=Times20050914>{{cite web |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1779849,00.htm |title=Europe Wins The Power To Jail British Citizens |publisher=The Times |date=[[2005-09-14]]}}</ref> The parliament is made up of the Queen and two houses: an elected House of Commons and an appointed [[House of Lords]]. Each member in the House of Commons is elected by [[plurality electoral system|simple plurality]] in a [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituency]]; general elections are called by the Monarch when the Prime Minister so advises. There is no minimum term for a Parliament, but a new election must be called within five years of the last general election.

[[Image:Westminster palace.jpg|thumb|The [[Houses of Parliament]]]]

The UK's three [[List of political parties in the United Kingdom#Major political parties in the United Kingdom|major political parties]] are the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], and the [[Liberal Democrats]]. Other parties such as the [[Democratic Unionist Party]], the [[Scottish National Party]], [[Plaid Cymru]], the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]], the [[Ulster Unionist Party]], and [[Sinn Féin]] (from Northern Ireland) hold most of the remaining seats in the House. In accordance with party policy, no elected Sinn Féin Member of Parliament has ever attended the House of Commons to speak in the House on behalf of their constituents as all Members of Parliament are required to take an oath of allegiance to the Monarch. However, the current five [[Sinn Féin]] MPs have since 2002 made use of the offices and other facilities available at Westminster.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1771635.stm|title=news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1771635.stm<!--INSERT TITLE-->}}</ref>

=== Administrative subdivisions ===
{{main|Subdivisions of the United Kingdom}}
The United Kingdom is divided into four ''[[home nations]]'' or ''[[Constituent country|constituent countries]]'': [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]], and [[Northern Ireland]]. The latter three each has a [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] legislature, [[Devolution|devolved]] from the United Kingdom Parliament, which relates specifically to each constituent country: the [[Scottish Parliament]], the [[National Assembly for Wales]], and the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]]. Each also has its own [[Executive (government)|Executive]], led by a [[First Minister]], which controls separate law making and constitutional powers devolved from Westminster. However, despite being the largest of the United Kingdom's four constituent countries, England, (with the exception of the [[Greater London Authority]]), has no devolved executive; it is ruled directly by the UK government.

Each nation is further subdivided for the purposes of [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local government]]. The Queen appoints a [[Lord-Lieutenant]] as her personal representative in lieutenancy areas across the UK; this is little more than a ceremonial role. The following table highlights the arrangements for local government, lieutenancy areas and cities across the home nations:

Historically, the four nations were divided into [[Counties of the United Kingdom|counties]] as areas for local government administration. Although these are still used to some extent for this purpose and as geographical areas, they are no longer the sole basis for [[wikt:local|local]] government administration.

In recent years, England has, for some purposes, been divided into nine intermediate-level [[Regions of England|Government Office Regions]]. Each region is made up of [[metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England|counties]] and [[unitary authorities]], apart from [[London]], which consists of [[London borough]]s. Although at one point it was intended that these regions would be given their own elected regional assemblies, the plan's future is uncertain following a rejection, by referendum, of a proposed assembly in the [[North East England|North East]] region.

[[City status in the United Kingdom|City status]] is governed by [[Royal Charter]]. There are sixty-six British cities: fifty in England; six in Scotland; five in Wales; and five in Northern Ireland.

The [[British crown|Crown]] has sovereignty over the [[Isle of Man]] and the [[Bailiwick]]s of [[Jersey]] and [[Guernsey]]. Collectively, these three territories are known as the [[Crown dependencies]], lands owned by the [[British monarch]] but not part of the United Kingdom. They are also not part of the European Union. However, the Parliament of the United Kingdom has the authority to legislate for the dependencies, and the British government manages their foreign affairs and defence.

The UK also has fourteen [[British overseas territory|overseas territories]] around the world, the last remaining territories of the [[British Empire]]. The overseas territories are also not considered part of the UK, but in most cases, the local populations have British citizenship and the right to abode in the UK. This has been the case since 2002.

=== Law ===
{{main|Law of the United Kingdom}}
[[Image:Edinburgh Scottish Parliament01 2006-04-29.jpg|thumb|[[Scottish Parliament]] is the national legislature of Scotland]]

The United Kingdom has three distinct [[systems of law]]. [[English law]], which applies in [[England and Wales]], and [[Courts of Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland law]], which applies in Northern Ireland, are based on [[common law|common-law]] principles. [[Scots law]], which applies in Scotland, is a hybrid system based on both common-law and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil-law]] principles. The [[Treaty of Union]] guaranteed the continued existence of a separate law system for Scotland.

The Appellate Committee of the [[House of Lords]] (usually just referred to, as "The House of Lords") is the highest court in the land for all criminal and civil cases in [[England]], [[Wales]], and [[Northern Ireland]], and for all civil cases in Scots law. Recent constitutional changes will see the powers of the House of Lords transfer to a new [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]].<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.dca.gov.uk/consult/supremecourt/supreme.pdf Constitutional reform: A Supreme Court for the United Kingdom]|252&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 258317 bytes -->}}, Department for Constitutional Affairs. Retrieved on [[2006-05-22]]</ref>

In [[England and Wales]], the [[Courts of England and Wales|court system]] is headed by the Supreme Court of Judicature of England and Wales, consisting of the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]], the [[High Court of Justice]] (for civil cases) and the [[Crown Court]] (for criminal cases). In [[Scotland]] the chief courts are the [[Court of Session]], for civil cases, and the [[High Court of Justiciary]], for criminal cases, while the [[sheriff court]] is the Scottish equivalent of the county court.

The [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]], comprising the same members as the Appellate Committee of the [[House of Lords]], is the highest court of appeal for several independent Commonwealth countries, the UK overseas territories, and the British crown dependencies.

=== Foreign relations ===
{{main|Foreign relations of the United Kingdom}}
The United Kingdom is a permanent member of the [[United Nations Security Council]], a member of the [[G8]] and [[NATO]], and a member state of the [[European Union]]. The UK has a "[[Special Relationship]]" with the [[United States]]. Apart from the US and [[Europe]], Britain's close allies include [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth nations]] and other [[Anglosphere|English speaking countries]]. Britain's global presence and influence is further amplified through its trading relations and its armed forces, which maintain approximately eighty military installations and other deployments around the globe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpowereurope.eu/|title=www.globalpowereurope.eu/<!--INSERT TITLE-->}}</ref>

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of the United Kingdom}}
The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is in Western Europe. It comprises the island of Great Britain (most of England, Scotland and Wales) and the northeastern one-sixth of the island of Ireland (Northern Ireland), together with many smaller islands. The mainland areas lie between latitudes 49° and 59° N (the Shetland Islands reach to nearly 61° N), and longitudes 8° W to 2° E. The Royal Greenwich Observatory, near London, is the defining point of the [[Prime Meridian]]. The United Kingdom has a total area of approximately {{convert|245000|sqkm|sqmi|-1}}.
The UK lies between the North Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea, and comes within {{convert|35|km|mi|0|lk=on}} of the northwest coast of France, from which it is separated by the [[English Channel]]. Northern Ireland shares a {{convert|360|km|mi|0}} land boundary with the Republic of Ireland. The Channel Tunnel ("Chunnel") now links the UK with France beneath the English Channel.

=== Topography ===
[[Image:Uk-map.svg|thumb|left|upright|Map of the United Kingdom.]]
[[Image:BenNevis2005.jpg|thumb|[[Ben Nevis]], in the [[Grampian Mountains (Scotland)|Grampian Mountains]], is the highest point in the [[British Isles]]]]

Most of England consists of lowland terrain, with some mountainous terrain in the north-west ([[Cumbrian Mountains]] of the Lake District), north (the upland moors of the [[Pennines]] and [[limestone]] hills of the [[Peak District]]) and south-west ([[Exmoor]] and [[Dartmoor]]) by the [[Tees-Exe line]]. Lower ranges include the [[limestone]] hills of the [[Isle of Purbeck]], [[Cotswolds]] and [[Lincolnshire Wolds]], and the [[chalk]] downs of the [[Southern England Chalk Formation]]. The main rivers and estuaries are the [[Thames]], [[Severn]] and the [[Humber|Humber Estuary]]. The largest urban area is [[Greater London]]. England's highest mountain is [[Scafell Pike]], which is in the [[Lake District]] {{convert|978|m|ft|0}}.

[[Scotland's geography]] is varied, with [[Scottish Lowlands|lowlands]] in the south and east and [[Scottish Highlands|highlands]] in the north and west, including [[Ben Nevis]], the highest mountain in the British Isles at {{convert|1344|m|ft|0}}. There are many long and deep-sea arms, [[firth]]s, and [[loch]]s. There are nearly eight hundred [[List of islands of Scotland|islands in Scotland]], mainly west and north of the mainland, notably the [[Hebrides]], [[Orkney Islands]] and [[Shetland Islands]]. In total, it is estimated that the UK includes around one thousand islands.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.celticlegend.co.uk/dialysis/scotland.htm |title=Dialysis Scotland |publisher=Celtic Legend |accessdate=2006-05-22}}</ref>

Wales is mostly mountainous, the highest peak being [[Snowdon]] (''Yr Wyddfa'') at {{convert|1085|m|ft|0}} above sea level, however South Wales is less mountainous than North and Mid Wales. North of the mainland is the island of [[Anglesey]] (''Ynys Môn'').

[[Image:ThreeCliffsBay.jos.500pix.jpg|thumb|right|Three Cliffs Bay, [[Gower Peninsula]].]]

Northern Ireland, making up the northeastern part of Ireland, is mostly hilly. It includes [[Lough Neagh]], at {{convert|388|sqkm|sqmi|0|lk=on}}, the largest body of water in the UK and [[Ireland]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/ni/geog.htm |title=Geography of Northern Ireland |publisher=University of Ulster |accessdate=2006-05-22}}</ref> The highest peak is [[Slieve Donard]] at {{convert|849|m|ft|0|lk=on}} in the province's [[Mourne Mountains]].

The greatest distance between two points on the UK mainland of Great Britain is {{convert|1350|km|mi|-1}} between [[Land's End]] in [[Cornwall]] (near [[Penzance]]) and [[John O'Groats]] in [[Caithness]] (near [[Thurso]]), a two day journey by car. When measured directly north-south it is a little over {{convert|1100|km|mi|-2}} in length and is a fraction under {{convert|500|km|mi|-2}} at its widest.

=== Climate ===
{{main|Climate of the United Kingdom}}
All parts of the United Kingdom have a temperate [[climate]], with plentiful rainfall all year round. The temperature varies with the seasons but seldom drops below {{convert|-10|C|lk=on}} or rises above {{convert|35|C}}. The prevailing wind is from the southwest, bearing frequent spells of mild and wet weather from the Atlantic Ocean. Eastern parts are most sheltered from this wind and are therefore the driest. Atlantic currents, warmed by the Gulf Stream, bring mild winters, especially in the west, where winters are also wet, especially over high ground. Summers are warmest in the south east of England, being closest to the European mainland, and coolest in the north. Snowfall can occur in winter and early spring, though it rarely settles to any great depth away from high ground.

==== Larger Urban Zones ====
{{further|[[Larger Urban Zones (LUZ) in the European Union]]}}
A [[European Union]] measurement of urbanisation, the '''Larger Urban Zone''' is a harmonised definition of [[metropolitan area]]. [[Eurostat]]'s objective was to have an area from which a significant share of the residents commute into the city, a concept known as the “functional urban region”. To ensure good data availability, Eurostat works with administrative boundaries that approximate the functional urban region.

Seven UK Zones feature in the top 50 in the EU.
* London - 11.62 million
* Manchester - 2.51 million
* Leeds/Bradford - 2.36 million
* Birmingham - 2.34 million
* Glasgow - 1.75 million

== Demography ==
{{main|Demography of the United Kingdom}}
[[Image:Populations of the nations in the United Kingdom.svg|right|thumb|The populations and percentage of total population in the four nations of the United Kingdom.]]

=== Population ===
At the April [[2001 UK Census]], the United Kingdom's population was 58,789,194, the third largest in the [[European Union]] (behind [[Germany]] and [[France]]), the fifth largest in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and the twenty-first largest in the world. This had been estimated up to 60,587,300 by the [[Office for National Statistics]] in 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/CCI/nugget.asp?ID=6 |title=UK population approaches 60 million |publisher=Office for National Statistics |date=[[2005-08-25]] |accessdate=2006-05-14}}</ref> In August 2006 it was confirmed that the UK's population had reached 60 million, then rapidly increased to 60.2 million, largely from net [[immigration]], but also because of a rising [[List of countries and territories by fertility rate|birth rate]] and increasing life expectancy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,1857779,00.html |title=Rising birth rate, longevity and migrants push population to more than 60 million |publisher=The Guardian |date=[[2006-08-25]] |accessdate=2006-08-25}}</ref>

The UK's overall [[population density]] is one of the highest in the world. About a quarter of the population lives in England's prosperous south-east and is predominantly urban and suburban,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/pyramids/pages/j.asp |title=Census 2001: South East |publisher=Office for National Statistics |accessdate=2006-05-14}}</ref> with an estimated 7,517,700 in the capital of London.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/lmp/la/2038431860/subreports/pop_time_series/report.aspx |title=All people population: City of London |publisher=Office for National Statistics |accessdate=2006-08-31}}</ref> The population of the United Kingdom has now reached 60,587,000 (mid 2006 estimate).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=6 |title=Population estimates: UK population grows to 60.6 million|publisher=Office for National Statistics|date=2007-08-22|accessdate=2007-09-22}}</ref>

In 2006, the UK's [[total fertility rate]] (TFR) was 1.86 children per woman, below the replacement rate of 2.1. In 2001, the TFR was at a record low of 1.63, but it has increased each year since, and will continue to do so as the share of births from immigrant mothers continues to prod the fertility rate. The TFR was considerably higher during the 1960s 'baby boom', peaking at 2.95 children per woman in 1964.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=369|title=www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=369<!--INSERT TITLE-->}}</ref>

=== Migration and ethnicity ===
{{main|Ethnic groups of the United Kingdom}}
Located as they are on a group of islands close to [[Continental Europe]], the lands now constituting the United Kingdom have historically been subject to many [[invasions]] and [[Human migration|migrations]], especially from [[Scandinavia]] and the continent - including [[Roman Britain|Roman]] occupation for several centuries. Present day Britons are descended mainly from the varied ethnic stocks that settled there before the eleventh century. The [[Cruithne (people)|pre-Celtic]], [[Celts|Celtic]], Roman, [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]], and Norse influences were blended in Great Britain under the [[Normans]], Scandinavian [[Viking]]s who had lived in northern France (Normandy). Since 1945, international ties forged by the [[British Empire]] have contributed to substantial immigration, especially from Africa and South Asia, and, most recently, the accession of new EU members in 2004 has fuelled more immigration from continental [[Europe]]. As of [[2001 British Census|2001]], 7.9% <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/CCI/nugget.asp?ID=764&Pos=4&ColRank=1&Rank=176 |title=Ethnicity: 7.9% from a non-White ethnic group |publisher=Office for National Statistics |date=[[2004-06-24]] |accessdate=2007-04-02}}</ref>
of the UK population identified themselves as an [[ethnic minority]].

Cities with high proportions of people from [[minority group|ethnic minorities]] include [[London]] with 40.1% of its population coming from minority groups, [[Leicester]] with 39.5% and [[Birmingham]] with 34.4%, according to the 2001 census.

In contrast with some other European countries, high [[Foreign-born population of Great Britain, 2001|foreign-born]] immigration is contributing to a rising population,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/immigration/story/0,,1852513,00.html |title=Immigration fails to stem European population loss |publisher=The Guardian |date=[[2006-08-17]] |accessdate=2006-08-20}}</ref> accounting for about half of the population increase between 1991 and 2001.

In 2004, the number of people who became British citizens rose to a record 140,795 - a rise of 12% on the previous year. This number had risen dramatically since 2000.

=== Language ===
{{main|Languages of the United Kingdom}}
[[Image:Anglospeak.svg|thumb|Countries where [[English language|English]] has ''de facto'' or ''de jure'' official language status.]]

Though the UK does not ''[[de jure]]'' have an official language, the predominant [[spoken language]] is [[English language|English]], a [[West Germanic]] language descended from [[Old English]] featuring a large number of borrowings from [[Old Norse]] and [[Norman language|Norman]]. The other indigenous languages of the UK are [[Scots language|Scots]] (which is closely related to English) and the [[Insular Celtic languages]]. The latter fall into two groups: the P-Celtic languages ([[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Cornish language|Cornish]]); and the Q-Celtic languages ([[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Scottish Gaelic]] and [[Manx language|Manx]]). Celtic dialectal influences from [[Cumbric]] persisted in Northern England for many centuries, most famously in a unique set of numbers used for counting sheep (see [[Yan Tan Tethera]]).

The English language has spread to all corners of the world (largely due to the British Empire) and has thus become [[International English|the business language of the world]]. Worldwide, it is [[English language learning and teaching|taught as a second language]] more than any other.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cepr.org/pubs/new-dps/dplist.asp?dpno=2055 |title=English-Language Dominance, Literature and Welfare |author=Jacques Melitz |publisher=Centre for Economic Policy Research |date=1999 |accessdate=2006-05-26}}</ref> The United Kingdom's Celtic languages are also spoken by small groups around the globe, mainly [[Scottish Gaelic in Canada|Gaelic]] in [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]], and Welsh in [[Patagonia]], [[Argentina]].

Immigrant languages constitute for up to 10% of the UK's population, [[French language|French]] is spoken by 2.3% of the country's population, 1.0% of Britons speak [[Polish language|Polish]] reflecting the recent mass migration to the UK. 0.9% of the UK's population speak [[German language|German]] and 0.8% [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. The majority of other foreign languages spoken in the UK originate from [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[Africa]]. A large percentage of the immigrants to the UK come from [[Anglophone]] countries (such as [[Nigeria]], [[Jamaica]], [[Hong Kong]] and the [[Philippines]]), which is why there is not a great deal of diversity between some of the country's ethnic minority communities.

=== Religion ===
{{Main|Religion in the United Kingdom}}
While the United Kingdom has a long tradition of [[Christianity]] and a link between [[church and state]] still remains, in practice the UK is a predominantly [[secular]] society with only 38%<ref name=Atheists>{{PDFlink|[http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_225_report_en.pdf Eurobarometer poll conducted in 2005]|1.64&nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 1722129 bytes -->}}. Page 11. European Commission. Retrieved on [[7 December]] [[2006]]</ref> proclaiming a belief in a [[God]]. People identify themselves with [[religion]] in the UK for both cultural and religious reasons and this is reflected by the disparity between the figures for those proclaiming a belief in a [[God]] and those identifying themselves with a particular religion. Christianity has the largest number of adherents followed by Islam, Hinduism and Sikhism.

==== Christianity ====

[[Image:Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral at dusk (reduced grain), corrected perspective.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral]] is a Roman Catholic [[Cathedral]] in Liverpool, England.]]

[[Christianity]] is the majority religion; there are many Christian [[churches]], [[denominations]], and [[sects]]. However, [[Christianity]] in the UK is on the decline. The [[Tearfund]] Survey<ref name=Tearfund_Survey>{{cite web |url=http://www.tearfund.org/webdocs/Website/News/Final%20churchgoing%20report.pdf |title=Tearfund Survey 2007 |accessdate=2007-05-05}}</ref> in 2007 revealed 53% identified themselves as Christian compared to 71.6% in the 2001 UK Census.<ref name=Christians>{{cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=293 |title=UK Census 2001 |accessdate=2007-04-22}}</ref> Only 7% of people in the UK are actually practising Christians. [[Christianity]] was first introduced to Britain by the [[Roman Britain|Romans]]. The direct influence of the [[Anglican Communion]] has been on the decline for many years but the [[Church of England]] retains a [[Lords Spiritual|representation]] in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] and the right to draft legislative measures (usually related to religious administration), through the [[General Synod]], that can be passed into law, but not amended by Parliament. The churches of the [[Anglican Communion]] in the rest of the UK were [[disestablishmentarianism|disestablished]] in the 19th and 20th centuries.

[[Scotland]] and [[northern England]] were [[Evangelism|evangelised]] first, by [[Celtic missionaries]] from [[Ireland]], such as [[Saint Ninian|Ninian]], [[Columba]] and [[Aidan of Lindisfarne|Aidan]]. [[Augustine of Canterbury|Augustine]] was subsequently sent to southern England by [[Pope Gregory I]] in 597.

The English Church split from [[Roman Catholic Church|Rome]] in 1534, during the reign of [[Henry VIII of England]] (see [[English Reformation]]). Today, the [[Church of England]] is the officially established [[Christian]] church in England and senior branch of the worldwide [[Anglican Communion]]. The [[British monarch]] is required to be a member of the Church of England under the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] and is the [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|Supreme Governor]]. The senior bishop of Church of England is the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].

The [[Church of Scotland]] (known informally as the [[Kirk]]) broke with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in 1560 (see [[Calvinism]] and [[Scottish Reformation]]). Today it is a [[Presbyterian]] church, recognised as the [[national church]] of Scotland, and not subject to state control. The British monarch is an ordinary member, and is required to swear an oath to "defend the security" of the Church at the coronation. The [[Scottish Episcopal Church]], which is part of the Anglican Communion, dates from the final establishment of Presbyterianism in Scotland in 1690. Further splits in the Church of Scotland, especially in the nineteenth century, led to the creation of various other Presbyterian churches in Scotland, including the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Church of Scotland]].

In the 1920s, the [[Church in Wales]] was separated from the Church of England and became [[Disestablishment|disestablished]] (lost its status as the state religion). However the Church in Wales remains in the [[Anglican Communion]]. [[Methodism]] and other independent churches are traditionally strong in Wales.

The Anglican [[Church of Ireland]] was disestablished in the nineteenth century. It covers the entire island of [[Ireland]] (both [[Northern Ireland]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]]). In Northern Ireland the [[Roman Catholicism in Ireland|Catholic Church in Ireland]] is the largest single denomination, although [[Protestant]]s are in the majority overall. The [[Presbyterian Church in Ireland]] is the largest Protestant denomination and is in terms of theology and history closely linked to the Church of Scotland

The [[Roman Catholic Church in Great Britain|Roman Catholic Church]] is the second largest denomination of Christianity in the UK. After the [[Protestant Reformation]], strict laws were passed against Catholics; these were removed by the [[Catholic Emancipation]] laws in 1829. There are separate Catholic hierarchies for [[Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales|England and Wales]], [[Roman Catholic Church in Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Roman Catholic Church in Ireland|Ireland]].

Other large Christian groups include the [[Methodists]] (founded by [[John Wesley]] in London) and the [[Baptists]]. There are also growing [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] or [[Pentecostal]] churches, many of which have flourished with [[Immigration to the United Kingdom|immigration]] from around the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and beyond.

==== Islam ====

More recently, [[refugees]] from [[Somalia]], [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus|Northern Cyprus]], the [[Balkans]] and [[Arab]] countries have increased Britain's Muslim population. The 2006 controversy over the [[burqa]], brought up in comments by politician [[Jack Straw (politician)|Jack Straw]], reflects a split between some Britons [[Criticism of Islam|questioning the extent to which traditionalist forms of Islam are compatible]] with British society, and others who believe that wearing the veil is compatible with Muslim integration in Britain.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/10/07/uk.straw/ |title=Veil: British papers back Straw |accessdate=2006-05-11 |date=[[2006-07-10]] |publisher=CNN}}</ref>

==== Other religions ====
[[Indian religions|Religions of Indian origin]], such as [[Hinduism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] are followed in Britain. As of the 2001 census, there are about 560,000 Hindus and 340,000 Sikhs. [[Buddhism]] is practised by about 150,000<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/profiles/uk.asp |title=Census 2001 - Profiles |accessdate=2007-01-27 |publisher=Office for National Statistics}}</ref> It is likely that these figures have increased since 2001.

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of the United Kingdom}}
[[London]] is a major centre for [[International Business|international business]] and commerce and is the leader of the three "command centres" for [[The Global Economy|the global economy]] (along with [[New York City]] and [[Tokyo]]).<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Saskia Sassen|Sassen, Saskia]]|title=The Global City: New York, London, Tokyo|year=2001|publisher=Princeton University Press|edition=2nd edition}}</ref> For over twenty-five years, the British economy has corresponded with what has been described by some since the 1980s as the [[Anglo-Saxon economy|Anglo-Saxon model]], focusing on the principles of liberalisation, the [[free market]], and low taxation and regulation. Based on [[market]] [[exchange rate]]s, the United Kingdom is the fifth largest economy in the world,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2006/01/data/dbcoutm.cfm?SD=2005&ED=2005&R1=1&R2=1&CS=3&SS=2&OS=C&DD=0&OUT=1&C=512-941-914-446-612-666-614-672-311-946-213-137-911-962-193-674-122-676-912-548-313-556-419-678-513-181-316-682-913-684-124-273-339-921-638-948-514-686-218-688-963-518-616-728-223-558-516-138-918-353-748-196-618-278-522-692-622-694-156-142-624-449-626-564-628-283-228-853-924-288-233-293-632-566-636-964-634-182-238-453-662-968-960-922-423-714-935-862-128-716-611-456-321-722-243-965-248-718-469-724-253-576-642-936-643-961-939-813-644-199-819-184-172-524-132-361-646-362-648-364-915-732-134-366-652-734-174-144-328-146-258-463-656-528-654-923-336-738-263-578-268-537-532-742-944-866-176-369-534-744-536-186-429-925-178-746-436-926-136-466-343-112-158-111-439-298-916-927-664-846-826-299-542-582-443-474-917-754-544-698&S=NGDPD&CMP=0&x=31&y=8 |title=Report for Selected Countries and Subjects |publisher=International Monetary Fund |date=2005 |accessdate=2006-05-15}}</ref> and the second largest in Europe after [[Germany]].

The British started the [[Industrial Revolution]], and, like most industrialising countries at the time, initially concentrated on heavy industries such as [[shipbuilding]], [[coal mining]], [[steel]] production, and [[textiles]]. The empire created an overseas market for British products, allowing the United Kingdom to dominate international trade in the 19th century. However, as other nations industrialised and surplus labour from [[agriculture]] began to dry up, coupled with economic decline after two world wars, the United Kingdom began to lose its economic advantage. As a result, heavy industry declined, by degrees, throughout the 20th century. The British service sector, however, has grown substantially, and now makes up about 73% of GDP.<ref>{{cite web |date=[[2006-04-26]] |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/Product.asp?vlnk=9333 |title=Index of Services (experimental) |publisher=Office for National Statistics |accessdate=2006-05-24}}</ref>

The service sector of the United Kingdom is dominated by [[financial services]], especially in banking and insurance. London is the world's largest financial centre with the [[London Stock Exchange]], the [[London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange]], and the [[Lloyd's of London]] insurance market all based in [[City of London|The City]]. It also has the largest concentration of foreign bank branches in the world. In the past decade, a rival financial centre in London has grown in the [[London Docklands|Docklands]] area, with [[HSBC]] and [[Barclays plc|Barclays Bank]] relocating their head offices there. Many multinational companies that are not primarily UK-based have chosen to site their European or rest-of-world headquarters in London: an example is the US financial services firm [[Citigroup]]. The Scottish capital, [[Edinburgh]], also has one of the large financial centres of [[Europe]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marklazarowicz.org.uk/parliament/speeches2003/4.30(WH).htm |title=Debate on Scottish financial services industry |first=Mark |last=Lazarowicz (Labour MP) |date=[[2003-04-30]] |accessdate=2006-05-16}}</ref>

[[Tourism in the United Kingdom|Tourism]] is very important to the British economy.

The British manufacturing sector, however, has greatly diminished, relative to the economy as a whole, since World War II. It is still a significant part of the economy, but only accounted for one-sixth of national output in 2003.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dti.gov.uk/ministers/speeches/hewitt150704b.html |title=TUC Manufacturing Conference |author=Patricia Hewitt |publisher=Department for Trade and Industry |date=[[2004-07-15]] |accessdate=2006-05-16}}</ref> The [[British motor industry]] is a significant part of this sector, although it has diminished with the collapse of [[MG Rover]] and most of the industry is foreign owned.

[[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] holds a major share of the global aerospace engines market.

The UK has a small coal reserve along with significant [[natural gas]], and [[Petroleum|oil]] reserves, although the natural gas and oil reserves are diminishing.

Government involvement throughout the economy is exercised by the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] (currently [[Alistair Darling]]) who heads [[HM Treasury]], but the [[Prime Minister]] (currently [[Gordon Brown]]), is [[First Lord of the Treasury]]; the Chancellor of the Exchequer is the Second Lord of the Treasury. However since 1997, the [[Bank of England]], headed by the [[Governor of the Bank of England]], has control of interest rates and other monetary policy.

=== Currency ===
{{seealso|Banknotes of the pound sterling|pound sterling}}
The currency of the UK is the [[pound sterling]], represented by the symbol '''[[Pound sign|£]]'''. The [[Bank of England]] is the [[central bank]], responsible for issuing currency. Banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland retain the right to issue their own notes, subject to retaining enough Bank of England notes in reserve to cover the issue.

Health is a [[devolved]] matter and though each of the [[constituent countries]] of the United Kingdom has healthcare available to all of their citizens that is free at the point of need (being funded from general taxation), considerable differences are developing between the different systems.<ref>[ http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7149423.stm NHS now four different systems} [[BBC]] [[January 2]] [[2008]]</ref> Though commonly referred to as the NHS across the UK, infact the [[National Health Service]] just covers England with [[NHS Scotland]] covering Scotland, [[NHS Wales]] covering Wales and the [[Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety]] providing healthcare in Northern Ireland. The NHS is one of the largest cohesive organisations of any type in the world.  

Public sector healthcare delivery consists of primary ([[General Practice]]), secondary ([[district general hospital]]) and tertiary ([[teaching hospital]]) levels of service.  There is considerable interaction and cross-flow between the various levels.

The private medical system is very small in the United Kingdom, but it is growing.{{Fact|date=January 2008}}
[[Image:NorfolkAndNorwichUniversityHospital(KatyAppleton)Aug2005.jpg|thumb|[[Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital|NNUH]] is a good example of a large modern hospital on a city's outskirts.]]
There are various regulatory bodies in the UK, both government-based (e.g. Department of Health, [[General Medical Council]], [[Nursing and Midwifery Council]]) and non-governmental-based (e.g. [[Royal College]]s).  

With respect to quality, unlike in the [[USA]] and many other developed countries where [[hospital accreditation]] groups independent of central government are utilised,  the UK government take on both the role of suppliers of healthcare and assessors of the quality of its delivery through groups organised directly by government departments, such as [[NICE]] and [[CHI]]. 

The United Kingdom has a large number of [[medical school]]s and [[dental school]]s, and a considerable establishment for training [[nurse]]s and professions allied to medicine, such as [[physiotherapy]], [[occupational therapy]], [[clinical psychology]] and [[radiography]].

=== Cinema ===
{{main|Cinema of the United Kingdom}}
The United Kingdom has been influential in the development of cinema, with the [[Ealing Studios]] claiming to be the oldest studios in the world. Despite a history of important and successful productions, the industry is characterised by an ongoing debate about its identity, and the influences of American and European cinema. Famous films include the [[Harry Potter film series|Harry Potter]] and [[Ian Fleming]]'s [[James Bond]] series which, although now made by American studios, used British source materials, locations, actors and filming crew.

=== Education ===

{{further|[[Education in the United Kingdom]]}}

The United Kingdom's official literacy rate (99%) is normal by developed country standards. Universal state education was introduced for the primary level in 1870 and secondary level in 1900 (except in Scotland where it was introduced in 1696, see [[Education in Scotland]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.humana.org/Article.asp?TxtID=223&SubMenuItemID=183&MenuItemID=43 |title=United Kingdom |publisher=Humana |accessdate=2006-05-18}}</ref> Education is mandatory from ages five to sixteen (15 if born in late July or August).

The majority of children in the UK are educated in state-sector schools, only a small proportion of which select on the grounds of academic ability. Around 7% of children in the UK are educated privately, the vast majority at the anachronistically named [[public schools]]. The products of public schools make up about 50% of students at the leading universities of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], as well as the majority of doctors, judges and business leaders. State schools which are allowed to select pupils according to intelligence and academic ability can achieve comparable results to public schools: out of the top ten performing schools in terms of GCSE results in 2006 two were state-run [[grammar schools]]. The [[Programme for International Student Assessment]], coordinated by the [[OECD]], currently ranks the UK's education as the 14th best in the world, being significantly higher than the OECD average.[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/42/8/39700724.pdf]

Some of the UK's 138 university level institutions are internationally renowned, especially those of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], and [[University of London|London]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ed.sjtu.edu.cn/rank/2005/ARWU2005_Top100.htm |title=Top 500 World Universities (1-100) |publisher=Shanghai Jiao Tong University |date=2005 |accessdate=2006-05-15}}</ref> and [[Loughborough University]] which is regarded as the best Sports University in the world<sup>Citation?</sup>, as well as holding research facilities for global companies such as [[Ford]] and [[Motorola]]. In the 2006 [[THES - QS World University Rankings]],<ref>[http://www.topuniversities.com/worlduniversityrankings/] — A 2006 ranking from ''[[THES - QS]]'' of the world’s research universities.</ref> 30 UK institutions were ranked amongst the top 200 universities in the world.

Fewer citizens of the UK are able to speak a foreign language than in any other EU country except Ireland. This has caused fear that the poor language skills in the UK will have a negative effect on business, and has led to calls for languages to be given priority in education.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/4442223.stm|title=news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/4442223.stm<!--INSERT TITLE-->}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/6960432.stm|title=news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/6960432.stm<!--INSERT TITLE-->}}</ref>

=== Literature ===
{{main|British literature}}
[[Image:Shakespeare.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Chandos portrait]], believed to depict the famed [[playwright]] [[William Shakespeare]].]]

The English playwright and poet [[William Shakespeare]] is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the [[English language]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9109536 |title=Encyclopedia Britannica article on Shakespeare |accessdate=2006-02-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761562101/Shakespeare.html |title=MSN Encarta Encyclopedia article on Shakespeare |accessdate=2006-02-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://columbia.thefreedictionary.com/Shakespeare,+William |title=Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia article on Shakespeare |accessdate=2006-02-26}}</ref>

Among the earliest British writers are [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] (12th century) , [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] (14th century) , and [[Thomas Malory]] (15th century). In the 18th century, [[Samuel Richardson]] is often credited with inventing the modern novel. In the 19th century, there followed further innovation by [[Jane Austen]], the [[Brontë|Brontë sisters]], the social campaigner [[Charles Dickens]], the [[naturalism (literature)|naturalist]] [[Thomas Hardy]], the visionary poet [[William Blake]] and romantic poet [[William Wordsworth]]. Twentieth century writers include the science fiction novelist [[H. G. Wells]], the controversial [[D. H. Lawrence]], the [[Modernists|modernist]] [[Virginia Woolf]], the prophetic novelist [[George Orwell]] and the poet [[John Betjeman]]. Most recently, the children's fantasy [[Harry Potter]] series by [[J. K. Rowling]] has recalled the popularity of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].

Scotland's contribution includes the detective writer [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], romantic literature by [[Sir Walter Scott]], the epic adventures of [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] and the celebrated poet [[Robert Burns]]. More recently, the modernist and nationalist [[Hugh MacDiarmid]] and [[Neil M. Gunn]] contributed to the [[Scottish Renaissance]]. A more grim outlook is found in [[Ian Rankin]]'s stories and the psychological horror-comedy of [[Iain Banks]]. Scotland's capital, [[Edinburgh]], is UNESCO's first worldwide city of literature.

In the early medieval period, Welsh writers composed the [[Mabinogion]]. In modern times, the poets [[R.S. Thomas]] and [[Dylan Thomas]] have brought Welsh culture to an international audience.

Many authors from other nationalities, particularly from Ireland, or from [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, have also lived and worked in the UK. Significant examples through the centuries include [[Jonathan Swift]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Bram Stoker]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Joseph Conrad]], [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Ezra Pound]], and more recently British authors born abroad such as [[Kazuo Ishiguro]] and Sir [[Salman Rushdie]].

In theatre, Shakespeare's contemporaries [[Christopher Marlowe]] and [[Ben Jonson]] added depth. More recently [[Alan Ayckbourn]], [[Harold Pinter]], [[Michael Frayn]], [[Tom Stoppard]] and [[David Edgar (playwright)|David Edgar]] have combined elements of surrealism, realism and radicalism.

=== Media ===
{{main|Media in the United Kingdom}}
The prominence of the English language gives the UK media a widespread international dimension.

==== Broadcasting ====
[[Image:Channel 4 Building - Horseferry Road - London - 310504.jpg|thumb|The Channel 4 building.]]
[[Image:BBC Television Centre.JPG|thumb|BBC Television Centre.]]
The [[BBC]] is the UK's publicly funded [[radio]], [[television]] and [[internet]] broadcasting corporation, and is the oldest and largest broadcaster in the world. It operates several [[BBC Television|television channels]] and [[BBC Radio|radio]] stations in both the UK and abroad. The BBC's international television news service, [[BBC World]], is broadcast throughout the world and the [[BBC World Service]] radio network is broadcast in thirty-three languages globally.

The domestic services of the BBC are funded by the [[television licence]], a legal requirement for any British household with a television receiver that is in use to receive broadcasts, regardless of whether or not the householders watch BBC channels. Households which are the principal residence of any person over 75 are exempt<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/information/agedover74s.jsp|title=TV licensing: aged over 74}}</ref> and the requirement does not extend to radio listeners. The BBC World Service Radio is funded by the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] and the television stations are operated by [[BBC Worldwide]] on a commercial subscription basis over cable and satellite services. It is also this commercial arm of the BBC that forms half of [[UKTV]] along with [[Virgin Media]].
There are five major nationwide television channels in the UK: [[BBC One]], [[BBC Two]], [[ITV1]], [[Channel 4]] and [[Five (channel)|Five]] - all currently transmitted by analogue terrestrial, free-to-air signals with the latter three channels funded by commercial advertising.

The UK now also has a large number of digital terrestrial channels including a further six from the BBC, five from ITV and three from Channel 4 among a variety of others.

The vast majority of digital [[Cable television|cable]] services are provided by [[Virgin Media]] with [[Satellite television|satellite]] being provided by [[BSkyB]] and [[free-to-air]] digital terrestrial television by [[Freeview]]. The entire country [[Digital switchover in the United Kingdom|will switch to digital]] by 2012.

[[Radio in the United Kingdom|Radio in the UK]] is dominated by [[BBC Radio]], which operates ten national networks and over forty local radio stations. The most popular radio station, by number of listeners, is [[BBC Radio 2]], closely followed by [[BBC Radio 1]]. There are also many hundreds of mainly local commercial radio stations across the country offering a variety of music or talk formats.

==== Print ====
Traditionally, [[List of newspapers in the United Kingdom|British newspapers]] could be split into ''quality'', serious-minded newspaper (usually referred to as "[[broadsheets]]" due to their large size) and the more populist, ''[[tabloid]]'' varieties. For convenience of reading, many traditional broadsheets have switched to a more [[Compact (newspaper)|compact]]-sized format, traditionally used by [[tabloid]]s. [[The Sun (newspaper)|''The Sun'']] has the highest circulation of any daily newspaper in the UK, with approximately a quarter of the market; its sister paper, ''[[The News of The World]]'' similarly leads the Sunday newspaper market,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/section/0,,1782,00.html |title=ABC Newspaper Circulation Figures |publisher=The Times |date=[[2006-05-12]] |accessdate=2006-05-16}}</ref> and traditionally focuses on celebrity-led stories. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', a [[Right-wing politics|right-of-centre]] broadsheet paper, has overtaken ''[[The Times]]'' (tabloid size format) as the highest-selling of the "quality" newspapers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.org.uk/
|title=Audit Bureau of Circulation Interactive Analysis National Newspaper Selection - Average Net Circulation (UK) 03-Jul-2006 to 30-Jul-2006 | accessdate=2006-09-04}} Lists the circulation of ''Daily Telegraph'' as 844,929 and ''The Times'' as 620,456.</ref> ''[[The Guardian]]'' is a more [[Liberalism in the United Kingdom|liberal]] (left-wing) "quality" broadsheet. The ''[[Financial Times]]'' is the main business paper, printed on distinctive salmon-pink broadsheet paper. Scotland has a distinct tradition of newspaper readership (see [[List of newspapers in Scotland]]).
First printed in 1737, the ''[[The News Letter|Belfast News Letter]]'' is the oldest known English-speaking daily newspaper still in publication today. One of its fellow Northern Irish competitors, ''[[The Irish News]]'', has been twice ranked as the best regional newspaper in the United Kingdom, in 2006 and 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newspaperawards.co.uk/default.htm |title=The Newspaper Awards |accessdate=2007-05-19}}</ref>
Aside from newspapers, a number of British magazines and journals have achieved worldwide circulation including ''[[The Economist]]'' and ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.

=== Music ===
[[Image:Beatlessullivantogether.jpg|thumb|[[The Beatles]] were and still are considered one of the world's greatest bands.]]
{{main|British Music}}

'''Classical music:''' Notable composers from the United Kingdom have included [[William Byrd]], [[Henry Purcell]], [[Sir Edward Elgar]], [[Sir Arthur Sullivan]] (most famous for working with librettist [[Sir W. S. Gilbert]]), [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], and [[Benjamin Britten]], pioneer of modern British [[opera]]. London remains one of the major [[classical music]] capitals of the world.

'''Popular music:''' Prominent among the UK contributors to the development of [[rock music]] in the 1960s and 1970s were [[The Beatles]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[The Who]], [[Queen]] and [[Black Sabbath]]. [[Heavy metal]], [[hard rock]], [[punk rock]] and [[New Wave (music)|New Wave]] were among the variations that followed. In the early 1980s, UK bands from the [[New Romantic]] scene such as [[Duran Duran]],[[Depeche Mode]] [[Spandau Ballet]], [[Soft Cell]] and [[Ultravox]] were prominent. In the 1990s, [[Britpop]] bands and [[electronica]] music also attained international success. More recent pop acts, including [[The Smiths]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] and the [[Spice Girls]], have ensured the continuation of the UK's massive contribution to popular music.

=== Philosophy ===
[[Image:David Hume.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[David Hume]] (1711 – 1776).]]

The United Kingdom is famous for the tradition of "British Empiricism", a branch of the philosophy of knowledge that states that only knowledge verified by experience is valid. The most famous philosophers of this tradition are [[John Locke]], [[George Berkeley]] and [[David Hume]]. Britain is also famous for a theory of moral philosophy, Utilitarianism, first used by [[Jeremy Bentham]] and later by [[John Stuart Mill]], in his short work [[Utilitarianism (book)]]. Other eminent philosophers from the UK include [[William of Ockham]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Jeremy Bentham]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Adam Smith]] and [[Alfred Ayer]]. Foreign born philosophers who settled in the UK include [[Isaiah Berlin]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Karl Popper]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].

=== Science, engineering and innovation ===
{{seealso|Category:British inventors|Category:British inventions}}
[[Image:GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg|thumb| Sir Isaac Newton.]]
The modern scientific method was promoted by the English philosopher [[Francis Bacon]] in the early seventeenth century, and subsequent advances credited to British scientists and engineers include:
* The [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]] and illumination of [[gravity]], by [[Sir Isaac Newton]] in the late 17th century
* The unification of electromagnetism, by [[James Clerk Maxwell]]
* The discovery of [[hydrogen]], by [[Henry Cavendish]]
* The [[steam locomotive]], by [[Richard Trevithick]] and [[Andrew Vivian]]
* The [[telephone]], by [[Alexander Graham Bell]]
* Evolution by [[natural selection]], by [[Charles Darwin]]
* The [[Turing machine]], by [[Alan Turing]], the basis of modern computers
* The structure of [[DNA]], by [[Francis Crick]] and others
* The development of the [[World Wide Web#Origins|World Wide Web]], largely attributed to [[Tim Berners-Lee]]

Notable [[civil engineering]] projects, whose pioneers included [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], contributed to the world's first national railway transport system. Other advances pioneered in the UK include the [[marine chronometer]], [[television]], the [[jet engine]], the modern [[bicycle]], [[electric lighting]], the [[electric motor]], the [[screw propeller]], the [[internal combustion engine]], military [[radar]], the electronic [[computer]], [[vaccination]] and [[antibiotics]].

Scientific journals produced in the UK include ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' and ''[[The Lancet]]''. In 2006, it was reported that the UK provided 9% of the world's scientific research papers and a 12% share of citations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/research/story/0,,1736095,00.html |title=Britain second in world research rankings |publisher=The Guardian |date=[[2006-03-21]] |accessdate=2006-05-14}}</ref>

=== Sport ===
{{main|Sport in the United Kingdom}}
[[Image:Wimbledon Grojean 2004 RJL.JPG|thumb|The [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] Championships, a [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournament, is held in [[Wimbledon, London]] every July.]]

A number of major [[sport]]s originated in the United Kingdom, including [[association football|football]], [[rugby football|rugby]], [[cricket]], [[tennis]] and [[golf]].

The most popular sport in the UK is football. The UK does not compete as a nation in any major football tournaments. Instead, the home nations compete individually as [[England national football team|England]], [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], [[Wales national football team|Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]]. Because of this four-team arrangement, the UK does not compete in football events at the [[Olympic Games]]. However, there are proposals for a united team taking part in the [[2012 Summer Olympic Games]], which are to be held in London. The [[The Football Association|English]] and [[Irish Football Association|Northern Irish]] football associations have confirmed participation in this team while the [[Scottish FA]] and the [[Welsh FA]] have declined to participate, fearing that it would undermine their independent sport status.

The UK is home to many world-renowned football clubs, such as [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. Clubs compete in [[Football in the United Kingdom|national leagues and competitions]] and some go on to compete in European competitions. British teams have been successful in European Competitions including some who have become European Cup/UEFA Champions League winners: [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] (five times), [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] (twice), [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] (twice), [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], and [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. More clubs from England have won the European Cup than any other country (four compared to three from Italy, Germany and the Netherlands). Moreover, England ranks second in the all time list of European club trophies won with 35, one behind Italy's 36. The European Cup competition itself was brought about due to the success of another UK club, [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], against top European sides<ref>http://galeb.etf.bg.ac.yu/~mirad/archive.html EuroCups Archive</ref> in the 1950s. The [[English Premier League|Premiership]] is also the most-watched football league in the world and is particularly popular in [[Asia]]; in the [[People's Republic of China]], matches attract television audiences between 100 million and 360 million, more than any other foreign sport.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.footy-live.com/Premiership.html |title=Footy Live |publisher=Live Sport Network |accessdate=2007-04-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3207829.stm |title=Chinese phone maker's fancy footwork |publisher=BBC News |date=[[27 October]] [[2003]] |accessdate=2006-08-09}}</ref>

[[Image:Wembley Stadium closeup.jpg|thumb|left|The new [[Wembley Stadium]] is the most expensive stadium ever built costing £793 million ($1.6 billion).]]

The 90,000 capacity [[Wembley Stadium]] is the principal sporting stadium of the UK. Between the demolition of the former 'twin towers' stadium and construction of the new one (completed in March 2007), Cardiff's 73,000 seater [[Millennium Stadium]] briefly served this role.

The early reference to the separate national identities in the UK is perhaps best illustrated by the game of cricket. [[Cricket]] was invented in [[England]]. There are league championships but the [[England|English]] national team dominates the game in Britain. There is no UK team. Some [[Sport in Ireland|Irish]] and [[Cricket in Scotland|Scottish]] players have played for [[England]] because neither Scotland nor Ireland have Test status and only play in One Day Internationals.

The UK has proved successful in the international sporting arena in [[rowing (sport)|rowing]]. It is widely considered that the sport's most successful rower is [[Steven Redgrave]] who won five gold medals and one bronze medal at five consecutive [[Olympic Games]] as well as numerous wins at the [[World Rowing Championships]] and [[Henley Royal Regatta]].
[[Image:Royal & Ancient Clubhouse.jpg|thumb|[[The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews]], generally regarded as the world's "Home of Golf".]]
Both forms of rugby are national sports. [[Rugby League]] originates from and is generally played in the North of England, whilst [[Rugby Union]] is played predominantly in [[Wales]], [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]], and [[Southern England]]. Having supposedly originated from the actions of [[William Webb Ellis]] at the School at [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]], it is considered the national sport of Wales. In [[rugby league]] the UK plays as one nation — [[Great Britain national rugby league team|Great Britain]] — though in union, it is represented by four nations: England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland (which consists of players from the [[Republic of Ireland]] and Northern Ireland). Every four years the [[British and Irish Lions]] tour Australia, New Zealand or South Africa. Here, rugby football differs internationally to association football, as the England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland (including the [[Republic of Ireland]]) teams combine to form the [[British and Irish Lions]] although they compete separately in all other international competitions.

The game of [[tennis]] first originated from the UK's second city of [[Birmingham]] between 1859 and 1865. The [[Wimbledon Championships]] are international [[tennis]] events held in [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]] in south London every summer and are regarded as the most prestigious event of the global tennis calendar.

[[Thoroughbred racing]] is also very popular throughout the UK. It originated under [[Charles II of England]] as the "Sport of Kings" and is a royal pastime to this day. World-famous horse races include the [[Grand National]], the [[Epsom Derby]] and [[Royal Ascot]]. The town of [[Newmarket]] is considered the centre of English racing, largely due to the famous [[Newmarket Racecourse]].

Golf is one of the most popular participation sports played in the UK, with [[St Andrews]] in Scotland being the sport's home course. Cricket is also popular, although the popularity of the game is dramatically greater in England than in other parts of the UK, all four constituent nations [[as of 2006]] compete at the One-Day International level — Scotland independently, Wales as part of the English team, and Northern Ireland as part of all-Ireland.

[[Shinty|Shinty (or ''camanachd'')]] (A sport derived from the same root as the [[Ireland|Irish]] [[hurling]] and similar to [[bandy]]) is popular in the [[Scottish Highlands]], sometimes attracting crowds numbering thousands in the most sparsely populated region of the UK.

The country is closely associated with [[motorsport]]. Many teams and drivers in [[Formula One]] (F1) are based in the UK and drivers from Britain have won more world titles than any other country. The country also hosts legs of the F1 and [[World Rally Championship]] and has its own [[Touring Car Racing]] championship, the [[British Touring Car Championship]] (BTCC).
The [[British Grand Prix]] takes place at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] each July.

The [[Royal Academy]] is located in London. Other major schools of art include the [[Slade School of Art]]; the six-school [[University of the Arts, London]], which includes the [[Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design]] and [[Chelsea College of Art and Design]]; the [[Glasgow School of Art]], and [[Goldsmiths, University of London]]. This commercial venture is one of Britain's foremost visual arts organisations.

During the late 1980s and 1990s, the [[Saatchi Gallery]] in London brought to public attention a group of multigenre artists who would become known as the [[Young British Artists]]. [[Damian Hirst]], [[Chris Ofili]], [[Rachel Whiteread]], [[Tracy Emin]], [[Mark Wallinger]], [[Steve McQueen (artist)|Steve McQueen]], [[Sam Taylor-Wood]], and the [[Chapman Brothers]] are among the better known members of this loosely affiliated movement.

* The [[flag of the United Kingdom]] is the [[Union Flag]] commonly known as the "Union Jack". It was created by the superimposition of the flags of [[Flag of England|England]] ([[St George's Cross]]) and [[Flag of Scotland|Scotland]] ([[Saint Andrew's Cross]]), with the [[Saint Patrick's cross]], representing Ireland, being added to this in 1801.

There is no official National [[flag of Northern Ireland]] following the [[Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973]] or any unofficial flag universally supported in Northern Ireland. The use of various flags in Northern Ireland is contentious. However, the [[Ulster Banner]] is often used for sporting events. See [[Northern Ireland flags issue]] and [http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/notes/snpc-04474.pdf The Union Flags and flags of the United Kingdom]</div>
* The [[national anthem]] of the United Kingdom is "[[God Save the King]]", with "King" replaced with "Queen" in the lyrics whenever the monarch is female. The anthem's name, however, remains "God Save the King".<ref>It is sometimes asserted by those used to a legislative tradition that "God Save the King/Queen" is not the actual national anthem of the United Kingdom — or sometimes that it is the de facto national anthem — because no law has ever been passed to say that that is the case. In the United Kingdom, however, such laws are unnecessary; custom, practice and proclamation are sufficient to establish it as the official national anthem.</ref>
* [[Britannia]] is a [[National personification|personification]] of the United Kingdom, originating from the [[Roman occupation of Britannia|Roman occupation]] of southern and central Great Britain.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.24carat.co.uk/britanniaframe.html |title=Britannia on British Coins |publisher=Chard |accessdate=2006-06-25}}</ref> Britannia is symbolised as a young woman with brown or golden hair, wearing a [[Corinthian helmet]] and white robes. She holds [[Poseidon]]'s three-pronged trident and a [[shield]], bearing the Union Flag. Sometimes she is depicted as riding the back of a lion. At and since the height of the British Empire, Britannia has often associated with maritime dominance, as in the patriotic song ''[[Rule Britannia]]''.
* The [[lion]] has also been used as a symbol of the United Kingdom; one is depicted behind Britannia on the [[British fifty pence coin|50 pence]] piece and one is shown crowned on the back of the [[10p|10 pence]] piece. It is also used as a symbol on the non-ceremonial flag of the [[British Army]]. Lions have been used as [[heraldic device]]s many times, including in the royal arms of both the kingdoms of [[Coat of Arms of England|England]], [[Royal coat of arms of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of Gwynedd]] in [[Wales]]. The lion is featured on the emblem of the [[England national football team]], giving rise to the popular football anthem ''[[Three Lions]]'', and the [[England national cricket team]]. The "three lions" on the English coat of arms were originally two leopards. An extra leopard was added by [[Richard the Lionheart]] and with the help of his name, they became known as three lions. They are now drawn to look more like lions. Leopards are traditionally depicted lying down whereas lions were drawn standing on all fours or up on their hind legs attacking, as in the Scottish [[Lion Rampant]].
* The [[bulldog]] is sometimes used as a symbol of [[Great Britain]], and is often associated with [[Winston Churchill]]'s defiance of Nazi Germany.
* Britain (especially England) has been personified as the character [[John Bull]], although this character is rarely used in modern times.
* The British landscape, and especially some of its distinctive flora such as the [[oak]] tree and the [[rose]], have long been a widely used proxy for the visual representation of British identity. The red rose is the emblem of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], the [[England national rugby union team]], the [[Rugby Football Union]] and [[Lancashire]].
