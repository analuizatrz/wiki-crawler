'''Ronald Ernest Paul''' (born August 20, 1935) is a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States Congress]]man, physician, and bestselling author from [[Lake Jackson, Texas]]. He is regularly featured on CNN and other US News outlets, and has a large base of supporters often called the "[[Ron Paul presidential campaign, 2008#Ron Paul Revolution|Ron Paul Revolution]]." He is also the founder of the [[Campaign for Liberty]].

Originally from the [[Green Tree, Pennsylvania|Green Tree]] suburb of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], he graduated from [[Gettysburg College]] in 1957, then studied at [[Duke University School of Medicine]]; after his 1961 graduation and a residency in obstetrics and gynecology, he became a [[U.S. Air Force]] [[flight surgeon]], serving outside the [[Vietnam War]] zone. He represented Texas districts in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] (1976–1977, 1979–1985, and 1997–present). and entered the [[1988 presidential election]], running as the [[Libertarian (U.S.)|Libertarian]] nominee while remaining a registered Republican. He placed a distant third. He was a [[Ron Paul presidential campaign, 2008|candidate]] in the [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|2008 Republican presidential primaries]], where he was placed fourth, and refused to endorse the candidate chosen by the [[2008 Republican National Convention]], [[John McCain]].

Paul has been described as [[classical conservatism|conservative]], [[Constitutionalist]], and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]].<ref name=ny>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/22/magazine/22Paul-t.html?ei=5124&en=22ee37525a9fc4f5&ex=1343016000&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink&pagewanted=all|title=The Antiwar, Anti-Abortion, Anti-Drug-Enforcement-Administration, Anti-Medicare Candidacy of Dr. Ron Paul|author=Caldwell, Christopher|work=[[New York Times Magazine]]|date=2007-07-22|accessdate=2007-07-21}}</ref> He advocates a foreign policy of [[United States non-interventionism|non-intervention]], having voted against actions such as the [[Iraq War Resolution]], but in favor of [[force against terrorists]] in [[Afghanistan]]. He favors withdrawal from the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] and the [[United Nations]], citing the dangers of foreign entanglements to national sovereignty. Having pledged never to raise taxes, he has long advocated ending the federal income tax, scaling back government spending, abolishing most federal agencies, and removing military bases and troops from foreign soil; he favors [[hard money (policy)|hard money]] and opposes the [[Federal Reserve]]. He also opposes the [[Patriot Act]], the federal [[War on Drugs]], [[No Child Left Behind]], and gun regulation. Paul is strongly [[pro-life]] and has introduced bills to negate ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', as he believes the Supreme Court has usurped each state's right to allow, regulate, or ban abortion.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.house.gov/paul/congrec/congrec2003/cr060403b.htm|title=Pro-Life Action Must Originate from Principle|author=Paul, Ron|publisher=[[U.S. House of Representatives]]|work=[[Congressional Record]]|date=2003-06-04|accessdate=2008-02-12}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Paul was born in Green Tree, Pennsylvania to Howard and Margaret ([[née]] Dumont) Paul. His family roots can be traced back to [[Hesse]], [[Germany]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/political/paul.html|title=The Ancestors of Ron Paul|author=Reitweisner, William Addams|accessdate=2008-11-13}}</ref> With an eighth-grade education, Howard co-owned Green Tree Dairy with his brothers Lewis and Arthur; the small-town truck farm stood just outside Pittsburgh. Paul was the third of five sons born during seven years in the [[Great Depression]], and he shared one bedroom of their four-room house with his brothers William (the eldest), David, Jerrold, and Wayne.<ref name="OneBrother">{{cite web|url=http://www.dailypaul.com/node/3844|title=One Brother in Pulpit, Another Seeks White House|date=October 19, 2007|language=English|accessdate=2008-11-14}}</ref> Paul began working at Howard's dairy at age five, and later delivered newspapers, worked in a drugstore, and became a milkman upon reaching driving age.<ref name=dailypaul>{{cite web|url=http://dailypaul.com/node/53|title=The American Dream - Through the Eyes of Mrs. Ron Paul|author=Paul, Carol|date=2007-03-16|publisher=Daily Paul|accessdate=2008-03-22}}</ref>

Excelling in [[track and field]], he graduated from [[Keystone Oaks High School|Dormont High School]] in 1953 with honors. He had a best mark in the 100-yard dash of 9.7&nbsp;seconds<ref name=seattletimes>{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com:80/html/nationworld/2003810874_paul29.html|title=Profile: Republican Ron Paul|date=2007-07-29|work=[[Seattle Times]]|accessdate=2007-12-21}}</ref> (the record was then 9.4&nbsp;seconds);<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hornetfootball.org/boosters/team_docs/track/Track-History.htm|title=Alameda Sprinter Rates with Greatest Prep Runners|work=[[Alameda Times-Star]]|date=1954-05-24|accessdate=2007-12-26}}</ref> as a junior, he was the 220-yard dash state champion<ref name=PTR/> and placed second in the 440-yard run.<ref name=dailypaul/> He was on the wrestling team, played football and baseball, and was student council president.<ref name=dailypaul/> After surgery on a knee injury, he took up swimming as a form of therapy.

==Marriage and family==

[[Image:Randpaul.jpg|thumb|Rand Paul speaking at a Ron Paul rally.]]

While at Dormont, schoolmate Carol Wells asked Paul to escort her to a [[sweet 16 (birthday)|sweet-16]] [[Sadie Hawkins party]], which was their first date. In 1956, Paul proposed marriage to Wells; the couple were wed on February 1, 1957, at Dormont [[PCUSA|Presbyterian]] Church.<ref name=dailypaul/>

They have five children, who were [[infant baptism|baptized]] [[ECUSA|Episcopalian]]:<ref name=ny/> Ronnie, Lori, Rand, Robert, and Joy.

==Military service and medical career==
Paul had considered becoming a [[Lutheran]] minister like two of his brothers,<ref name=seattletimes/> but instead decided to pursue a medical degree at [[Duke University School of Medicine]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]], which was attained in 1961. He began [[residency (medicine)|residency]] training and an internship, both in [[internal medicine]], at [[Henry Ford Hospital]] in Detroit (1961–1962).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=P000583|title=Paul, Ronald Ernest|accessdate=2007-05-20|publisher=[[U.S. Congress]]|work=[[Biographical Directory of the United States Congress]]}}</ref>

The medical training was soon interrupted when he received a [[draft (U.S.)|draft]] notice and was commissioned a [[captain (United States)|Captain]] in the U.S. Air Force during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].<ref name=CSPAN>{{cite news|url=http://chbn.com/Clip.aspx?key=1CD9E3A0397BCBEC|title=Congressman Ron Paul Announces Presidential Run while taking LIVE calls on C-SPAN!|accessdate=2007-07-08|publisher=[[Capitol Hill]] Broadcasting Network|work=[[the Hill (newspaper)|the Hill]]|format=video|date=2007-03-20}}</ref> He was based out of [[Kelly Air Force Base]] in [[San Antonio]], and remained in the military during the early years of the Vietnam War.<ref>{{cite news|author=Brockwell, Ian|date=2007-07-15|url=http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/viewArticle.asp?articleID=32269|title=Ron Paul — A True Patriot!|work=American Chronicle|accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref> While on duty as a flight surgeon from 1963 to 1965, he attended to ear, nose, and throat problems of pilots in [[South Korea]], [[Iran]], [[Ethiopia]], and [[Turkey]], but was never sent to [[Vietnam]].<ref name=ny/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vote-smart.org/bio.php?can_id=BC031929|title=Representative Ronald Ernest "Ron" Paul (TX)|publisher=[[Project Vote Smart]]|accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref> While stationed at Kelly Air Force Base, he obtained his private pilot's license.<ref name=lambda/> The experience of performing physicals on helicopter pilot candidates, at a time when he saw many helicopters being shot down, deeply affected Paul; he later considered his indirect association with Vietnam as a catalyst for his rejection of interventionist foreign policy.<ref name=gold/>

While in San Antonio, he moonlighted three nights a week in a local church hospital's emergency room for $3 per hour, and became involved with [[Barry Goldwater]]'s presidential campaign.<ref name=thp/> He then served in the [[Air National Guard]] while completing his residency (1965–1968), having switched to ob/gyn at the [[University of Pittsburgh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ronpaulforcongress.com/html/veterans.html|title=Congressman Ron Paul — "Fighting For Our Country"|accessdate=2007-07-08|publisher=Committee to Re-Elect Ron Paul|year=2007}}</ref> His residency research into causes of pregnancy [[toxemia]] was subsequently published in the journal ''Obstetrics and Gynecology''.

He moved to [[Lake Jackson, Texas]], on July 31, 1968, and eventually delivered more than 4,000&nbsp;babies.<ref name=2008bio/> Assuming the practice of a retiring doctor, Paul became the only ob/gyn doctor in [[Brazoria County]],<ref name=lambda/> reportedly delivering 40–50&nbsp;babies a month and frequently busy with surgery.<ref name=no/> His practice refused [[Medicare (U.S.)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] payments; he worked [[pro bono]], arranged discounted or custom-payment plans for needy patients,<ref name=paulfacts/> or otherwise "just took care of them".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.concordmonitor.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070930/NEWS01/709300331|title=Many Awakenings: Ron Paul is as surprised as anyone at the near messianic zeal he inspires|date=2007-09-30|accessdate=2007-10-08|author=Liebowitz, Sarah|work=[[Concord Monitor]]}}</ref>

==Early Congressional career==
While still a medical resident in the 1960s, Paul was influenced by [[Friedrich Hayek]]’s ''[[Road to Serfdom]]'', which led him to read many works of [[Ayn Rand]] and [[Ludwig von Mises]]. He came to know economists [[Hans Sennholz]] and [[Murray Rothbard]] well, and credits to them his interest in the study of economics. He claims that he realized what the [[Austrian school]] economists wrote was coming true on August 15, 1971, when President [[Richard Nixon]] [[Nixon Shock|closed the "gold window"]] by implementing the [[U.S. dollar]]'s complete departure from the [[gold standard]].<ref name=gold/> That same day, the young physician decided to enter politics, saying later, "After that day, all money would be political money rather than money of real value. I was astounded."<ref name=no/>

===First campaigns===
Inspired by his belief that the monetary crisis of the 1970s was predicted by the Austrian school, and caused by excessive government spending on the Vietnam War and wholesale [[welfare state|welfare]],<ref name=lambda/> Paul became a delegate to the Texas Republican [[political convention|convention]] and a Republican candidate for Congress. Incumbent [[Robert R. Casey]] defeated him in the [[TX-22|22nd district]]; [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democrats]] won 1974 heavily. When President [[Gerald Ford]] appointed Casey to head the [[Federal Maritime Commission]], Paul won a 1976 [[special election]] to fill the empty seat. Paul lost some months later in the [[general election]], to Democrat [[Robert Gammage]], by fewer than 300&nbsp;votes (0.2%), but defeated Gammage in a 1978 rematch and won new terms in 1980 and 1982.

Paul was the first Republican representative from the area; he also led the Texas Reagan delegation at the national Republican convention.<ref name=campaigncom>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF-s1voM_Y|title=The Ron Paul Story|format=YouTube|accessdate=2007-06-14}}</ref> His successful campaign against Gammage surprised local Democrats, who had expected to retain the seat easily in the wake of the [[Watergate scandal]]. Gammage underestimated Paul's support among local mothers: "I had real difficulty down in Brazoria County, where he practiced, because he'd delivered half the babies in the county. There were only two obstetricians in the county, and the other one was his partner."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15016924|title=Paul Has Long Drawn Support from Unlikely Places|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|date=2007-10-07|accessdate=2007-10-23|author=Goodwyn, Wade|work=the '08 Candidates' First Campaign}}</ref>

===House of Representatives===
Paul was the first member of Congress to propose [[term limit]]s legislation in the House,<ref name=wsj1997>{{cite news|url=http://www.seedship.com/politics/ronpaul1.html|title=The Libertarian Congressman Is Back|work=[[Wall Street Journal]]|date=1997-01-13|page=A18|accessdate=2007-09-27}}</ref> where he also declined to attend junkets or register for a Congressional pension while serving four terms.<ref name=campaign1996>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2519/is_n6_v17/ai_18535311|title=Paul vs. Laughlin — Ron Paul's campaign against Representative Greg Laughlin|author=Beiler, David|date=1996-06|publisher=Campaigns and Elections}}</ref> His chief of staff (1978–1982) was [[Lew Rockwell]].<ref name=insight1997>{{cite news|title=Insight on the News|date=1997-01-10|author=Berlau, John}}</ref> In 1980, when a majority of Republicans favored President [[Jimmy Carter]]'s proposal to reinstate draft registration, Paul argued that their views were inconsistent, stating they were more interested in registering their children than they were their guns.<ref name=wsj1997/> He also proposed legislation to decrease Congressional pay by the rate of inflation; he was a regular participant in the annual Congressional [[baseball]] game;<ref name=campaigncom/> and he continued to deliver babies on Mondays and Saturdays during his entire 22nd district career.<ref name=no/>

During his first term, Paul founded a [[think tank]], the [[Foundation for Rational Economics and Education]] (FREE).<ref name=free>{{cite web|url=http://www.free-nefl.com/html/introduction.html|title=Introduction to FREE and NEFL|publisher=[[Foundation for Rational Economics and Education]]|accessdate=2008-02-12}}</ref> Also in 1976, the foundation began publication of the first monthly newsletter connected with Paul, ''Dr. Ron Paul's Freedom Report''<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.tnr.com/downloads/freedomApril1978.pdf|journal=Dr. Ron Paul's Freedom Report|title=The absence of force and toleration of others is the key to peace and prosperity|month=April | year=1978|author=Paul, Ron, attrib.|publisher=[[Foundation for Rational Economics and Education]]|volume=3|issue=4|accessdate=2008-02-13|format=PDF (reprint)|oclc=15124395}}</ref> (or ''Special Report''). It also publishes [[monographs]], books, radio spots, and (since 1997) a new series of the monthly newsletter, ''Ron Paul's Freedom Report'', which promote the principles of limited government.

On the [[House Banking Committee]], Paul blamed the Federal Reserve for inflation,<ref name=2008bio/> and spoke against the banking mismanagement that led to the [[savings and loan crisis]].<ref name=ny/> The U.S. Gold Commission created by Congress in 1982 was his and [[Jesse Helms]]'s idea, and Paul's commission [[minority report]] was published by the [[Cato Institute]] in ''The Case for Gold'';<ref name=gold>{{cite web|work=J.

In 1984, Paul chose to run for the [[U.S. Senate]] instead of re-election to the House, but lost the Republican primary to [[Phil Gramm]].<ref>{{cite news|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|date=2007-07-26|author=Rudin, Ken|accessdate=2008-03-22|title=Ron Paul, George and Ringo|work=Political Junkie}}</ref> He returned to full-time medical practice<ref name=2008bio/> and was succeeded by former state representative [[Tom DeLay]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lrl.state.tx.us/legis/members/roster.cfm?leg=68|title=Members and leaders of the Texas Legislature|accessdate=2007-07-08|publisher=Legislative Reference Library of Texas}}</ref> In his House [[farewell address]], Paul said, "Special interests have replaced the concern that the Founders had for general welfare. Vote trading is seen as good politics. The errand-boy mentality is ordinary, the defender of liberty is seen as bizarre. It's difficult for one who loves true liberty and utterly detests the power of the state to come to Washington for a period of time and not leave a true [[cynicism|cynic]]."<ref name=insight1997/>

According to Paul, his presidential run was about more than reaching office; he sought to spread his libertarian ideas, often to school and university groups regardless of vote eligibility. He said, "We're just as interested in the future generation as this election.

===Campaigns===
{{details|Texas's 14th Congressional district}}

====1996 campaign====
In 1996, Paul was re-elected to Congress after the toughest campaign race he had faced since the 1970s. Since the Republicans had taken over both houses of Congress in the [[United States House elections, 1994|1994 election]], Paul entered the race hopeful that his [[Constitutionalist]] policies of tax cuts, closing agencies, and curbing the UN would have more support,<ref name=paulsneary>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3827/is_199806/ai_n8799789|title=Paul vs. Sneary|date=1998-06-26|accessdate=2007-11-18|work=[[Human Events]]}}</ref> but he quickly concluded "there was no sincere effort" toward his goals.<ref name=lambda/> The [[Republican National Committee]] focused instead on encouraging Democrats to switch parties, as Paul's primary opponent, incumbent [[Greg Laughlin]], had done in 1995. The party threw its full weight behind Laughlin, including support from House Speaker [[Newt Gingrich]], Governor [[George W. Bush]], and the [[National Rifle Association]]. Paul responded by running newspaper ads quoting Gingrich's harsh criticisms of Laughlin's Democratic voting record 14&nbsp;months earlier.<ref name=campaign1996/> Paul won the primary with support from baseball pitcher, constituent, and friend [[Nolan Ryan]] (as honorary campaign chair and ad spokesman), as well as tax activist [[Steve Forbes]]<ref name=ny/> and conservative commentator [[Pat Buchanan]] (both of whom had run presidential campaigns that year).

Paul's Democratic opponent in the fall election, [[trial lawyer]] [[Charles "Lefty" Morris]], received assistance from the [[AFL-CIO]], but Paul's contributor base outraised Morris two-to-one, giving the third-highest amount of individual contributions received by any House member (behind Gingrich and [[Bob Dornan]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/118086.html|title=Paul for President?|accessdate=2007-05-28|author=[[Brian Doherty (journalist)|Doherty, Brian]]|date=2007-01-22|work=[[Reason magazine]]}}</ref>

While Paul was able to paint Morris as a tool of trial lawyers and big [[labor union|labor]], Morris ran numerous ads about Paul's advocacy of federal drug law repeal, and about the views Paul published in his newsletters,<ref name=no/> some of which had contained derogatory comments concerning race and other politicians, making them a public issue for the first time.<ref>{{cite news|work=Campaign '96 U.S. House|title=Newsletter excerpts offer ammunition to Paul's opponent|author=Bernstein, Alan|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070512114222/http://www.chron.com/content/chronicle/aol-metropolitan/96/05/23/paul.html|publisher=[[Houston Chronicle]]|date=1996-05-22|accessdate=2007-10-05|quote=Black males age&nbsp;13 [seemed] as big, strong, tough, scary and culpable as any adult" and "unbelievably fleet-footed" in committing crimes; President [[Bill Clinton]] was accused of fathering [[illegitimate]] children and using [[cocaine]]; "complex [[embezzling]]" became a "100&nbsp;percent white and [[Asia]]n" crime; the [[Israeli government]] was labeled a powerful Washington lobby "of the bad sort.}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=The Congressman Who Voted Against a Congressional Medal for Rosa Parks|journal=Journal of Blacks in Higher Education|date=Summer 1999|volume=24|pages=38–9|url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=1077-3711(199922)24%3C38%3ATCWVAA%3E2.0.CO%3B2-K|month=October|year=1999}}</ref> After the [[Los Angeles riots of 1992]], the ''Political Report'' proposed "that 95 percent of the black males in Washington DC are semi-criminal or entirely criminal", and stated that "the criminals who terrorize our cities&nbsp;... largely are" young black males, who commit crimes "all out of proportion to their numbers".<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.tnr.com/downloads/sponraceterrorism.pdf|date=1992-06-15|title=This is America, 1992|journal=Ron Paul Political Report|publisher=Ron Paul & Associates|accessdate=2008-02-13|volume=6|issue=6|format=PDF (reprint)|author=No byline}}</ref> Paul's campaign replied that voters might not understand the "tongue-in-cheek, academic" quotes out of context, and rejected Morris' demand to release back issues. Paul said he was alluding to a contemporary scientific study finding that "of black men in Washington&nbsp;... about 85&nbsp;percent are arrested at some point in their lives".<ref>{{cite news|author=Deparle, Jason|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE6D9103AF93BA25757C0A964958260|title=42% of Young Black Males Go Through Capital's Courts|work=[[New York Times]]|date=1992-04-18|accessdate=2007-11-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Miller, Jerome G.|year=1992|title=Hobbling a Generation: African American Males in the District of Columbia's Criminal Justice System|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=selr6BDsMNAC&pg=PA141&sig=8pLyDV8iqy0trgHViU6I0UgoizE#PPA141,M1|accessdate=2007-11-12}}</ref> Paul went on to win the election in a close margin.

====Later campaigns====
In 1998 and again in 2000, Paul defeated [[Loy Sneary]], a Democratic [[Bay City, Texas|Bay City]] rice farmer and former [[Matagorda County]] judge,<ref name=no/> by running ads warning voters to be "leery of" Sneary.<ref name=saynot/> Paul accused Sneary of voting to raise his pay by 5%, increasing his travel allotment by 400% in one year, and using increased taxes to start a new government [[bureaucracy]] to handle a [[license plate]] fee he enacted. Sneary's aides said he had voted to raise all county employees' pay by five percent in a [[cost-of-living increase]]. Paul countered that he had never voted to raise Congressional pay.<ref name=paulsneary/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20040805041451/http://www.chron.com/cgi-bin/auth/story.mpl/content/chronicle/metropolitan/98/08/15/notebook.2-0.html|title=Foes lock horns over Paul's radio ads|accessdate=2007-05-26|date=1998-08-14|work=Campaign Notebook|publisher=[[Houston Chronicle]]|author=Bernstein, Alan}}</ref> In both campaigns, the national Democratic Party and major unions continued to spend heavily on targeting Paul.<ref name=no/>

In 2001, Paul took "moral responsibility" for the comments printed in the "Ron Paul" newsletters, telling ''[[Texas Monthly]]'' that they were written by unnamed contributors and did not represent his views.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.freemarketnews.com/WorldNews.asp?nid=41822|title=Ron Paul Race Smear Erased?|date=2007-05-22|work=Free Market News|publisher=Free Market News Network|accessdate=2008-03-03}}</ref> He said newsletter remarks referring to [[U.S. Representative]] [[Barbara Jordan]] (which called her a "fraud" and a "half-educated victimologist" whose "race and sex protect her from criticism") were "the saddest thing, because Barbara and I served together and actually she was a delightful lady." The magazine defended Paul's decision to protect the writer's confidence in 1996, concluding, "In four terms as a U.S. congressman and one presidential race, Paul had never uttered anything remotely like this."<ref name=no/> RP&A, the chief publisher, was dissolved the same year.<ref name=whowrote/>

An online grassroots petition to draft Paul for the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]] garnered several thousand signatures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:kzoMbojcmoAJ:www.petitiononline.com/mod_perl/signed.cgi%3FPaul2004|title=Ron Paul for President 2004|author=Allan, Sterling D|publisher=Petition Online}}</ref> On December 11, 2001, he told the independent movement that he was encouraged by the fact that the petition had spread the message of Constitutionalism, but did not expect a White House win at that time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20040722093715/http://www.paul2004.com/RonsResponse/index.html|title=Ron Paul's Response to "Ron Paul for President 2004" Petition|author=Allan, Sterling D.|publisher=Draft Ron Paul for United States President 2004|date=2001-12-11|accessdate=2008-03-21}}</ref> Further prompting in early 2007 led him to enter the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 race]].

===Relationship with district===
After [[2003 Texas redistricting]], Paul's district is larger than [[Massachusetts]],<ref>{{cite news|title=GOP House Candidate Responds to Charges|accessdate=2007-09-11|author=Pressley, Sue Ann|date=1996-05-26|work=[[Washington Post]]}}</ref> with {{convert|675|mi|km}} of [[Gulf of Mexico]] coastline between [[Houston]] and [[Corpus Christi, Texas]], covering some 22&nbsp;counties. Even so, Paul opposes programs like [[National Flood Insurance Program|federally funded flood insurance]] (typically supported by coastal and rural representatives) because it requires those outside flood zones to subsidize those within, but prohibits those within from choosing their own insurers. In an overwhelmingly rural region known for [[ranching]] and [[rice]] farms,<ref name=gold/> Paul opposes farm subsidies because they are paid to large corporations rather than small farmers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,252847,00.html|title=Ron Paul, the Real Republican?|author=[[Radley Balko|Balko, Radley]]|date=2007-02-20|accessdate=2007-11-06|publisher=[[Fox News]]|work=Straight Talk}}</ref> Despite his voting against heavily supported legislation like [[farm bill]]s, Paul's devotion to reducing government resonates with 14th district voters:<ref name=no/> in a survey, 54% of his constituency agreed with his goal of eliminating the [[U.S. Department of Education]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/paul/tst/tst97/tst072097.htm|title=Parents must have control of education|accessdate=2007-09-13|author=Paul, Ron|date=1997-07-20|work=[[Congressional Record]]|publisher=[[U.S. House of Representatives]]}}</ref>

In ''[[The Revolution: A Manifesto]]'', Paul states his views on earmarks this way: "The real problem, and one that was unfortunately not addressed in the 2007's earmark dispute, is the size of the federal government and the amount of money we are spending in these appropriations bills. Cutting even a million dollars from an appropriations bill that spends hundreds of billions will make no appreciable difference in the size of government, which is doubtless why politicians and the media are so eager to have us waste our time on [earmarks]."<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul, Ron|year=2008|title=The Revolution: A Manifesto|pages=81–82}}</ref>

Paul also spends extra time in the district to compensate for "violat[ing] almost every rule of political survival you can think of".<ref name=no/> He often logs over {{convert|300|mi|km}} daily,<ref name=no/> and is famous for attending civic ceremonies for veterans, graduates, and [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]], often accompanied by his grandchildren. His staff helps senior citizens obtain free or low-cost prescription drugs through a little-known drug company program; procures lost or unreceived medals for war veterans, holding dozens of medal ceremonies annually; is known for its effectiveness in tracking down [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] checks; and sends out birthday and condolence cards.<ref name=no/><ref name=wsj2003/>

In 2001, he was one of only eight doctors in the House; even fewer had continued to practice while in office. He is occasionally approached by younger area residents to thank him for attending their births.<ref name=no/>

===Legislation===
{{main|Legislation sponsored by Ron Paul}}
Paul authors more bills than the average representative, such as those that impose [[term limits]], or abolish the [[income tax (U.S.)|income tax]]<ref name=endirs/> or the Federal Reserve; many do not escape committee review. He has written successful legislation to prevent [[eminent domain]] seizure of a church in New York, and a bill transferring ownership of the [[Lake Texana]] dam project from the federal government to Texas. By amending other legislation, he has barred funding for [[national identification numbers]], funding for federal teacher certification,<ref name=no/> [[International Criminal Court]] jurisdiction over the [[U.S. military]], American participation in any U.N.

Paul was one of six Republicans to vote against the [[Iraq War Resolution]], and (with [[Oregon]] representative [[Peter DeFazio]]) sponsored a resolution to repeal the war authorization in February 2003.

Paul was on a [[bipartisan]] coalition of 17&nbsp;members of Congress that sued President [[Bill Clinton]] in 1999 over his conduct of the [[Kosovo war]]. They accused Clinton of failing to inform Congress of the action's status within 48&nbsp;hours as required by the [[War Powers Resolution]], and of failing to obtain Congressional declaration of war. Congress had voted 427–2 against a declaration of war with [[Yugoslavia]], and had voted to deny support for the air campaign in Kosovo. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit, ruling that since Congress had voted for funding after Clinton had actively engaged troops in the war with Kosovo, legislators had sent a confusing message about whether they approved of the war. Paul said that the judge's decision attempted to circumvent the Constitution and to authorize the president to conduct a war without approval from Congress.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/paul/press/press99/pr060999.htm|title=Judge sides with Clinton|accessdate=2007-06-12|author=Paul, Ron|date=1999-06-09|publisher=[[U.S. House of Representatives]]}}</ref>
