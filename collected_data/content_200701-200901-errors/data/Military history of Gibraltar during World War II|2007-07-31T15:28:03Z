[[Gibraltar]] has been a [[United Kingdom|British]] fortress and bulwark for over 300 years and a vital factor in British strategy in all wars, both as a last foothold on the [[Europe|Continent of Europe]], and as a bastion of [[Royal Navy|British sea power]].<ref>''The Rock'' by Warren Tute, publ. by ''Companion Book Club'',. 1958</ref> From the first days of [[World War II]], the Rock became a vital pivot in the [[Mediterranean Theatre of World War II|Mediterranean Theatre]]. Gibraltar controlled traffic in and out of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and was thus of major maritime importance.<ref>William G.F. Jackson, The Rock of the Gibraltarians. A History of Gibraltar, Grendon : Gibraltar Books (1987) 1998</ref>

Gibraltar was a strongly protected naval station from which ships could operate in the Atlantic and in the Mediterranean. [[Force H]], under the command of [[James Fownes Somerville|Vice-Admiral James Somerville]] was based in Gibraltar and had the task of maintaining Naval superiority and providing a strong escort for the convoys which had to be pushed through to help [[Siege of Malta (1940)|beleaguered Malta]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/73/a2683073.shtml|title=Gibraltar's role in WWII|publisher=WW2 People's War|accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref> Gibraltar came under aerial bombardment from the [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] aircraft and also from the Italian aircraft from [[Sardinia]], as well as underwater exploits of the Italian [[frogman|frogmen]] and their [[human torpedo]]s which were based on an interned Italian ship ''SS Olterra'' in the nearby Spanish harbour of [[Algeciras]].<ref name="bbc1"/>

Inside the [[Rock of Gibraltar]] itself, miles of tunnels were dug out of the limestone. Masses of rock was blasted out to build an "underground city".<ref name="bbc1">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/99/a2627499.shtml|title=What life was like on the Rock during the War Years|publisher=WW2 People's War|accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref> There were barracks in huge man-made caverns, fully equipped hospitals with an operating theatre and x-ray apparatus.<ref name="bbc1"/>

[[Operation Torch]], the Allied invasion of [[French North Africa]] in November 1942 was coordinated from the Rock.<ref name="optorch">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/99/a2627499.shtml|title=What life was like on the Rock during the War Years|publisher=WW2 People's War|accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref> General [[Dwight D.

==Evacuation==
[[Image:Mason MacFarlane and Churchill in Gib.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Governor of Gibraltar]] [[Noel Mason-Macfarlane|Mason MacFarlane]] with Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] in Gibraltar.]]
[[World War II]] dramatically changed the lives of all Gibraltarians. The decision to enforce mass [[evacuation]] in order to increase the strength of the [[Rock of Gibraltar|Rock]] with more [[military]] and [[navy|naval]] personnel meant that most Gibraltarians (some for as long as ten years) had nowhere to call ‘home’. Only those civilians with essential jobs were entitled to stay but it gave the entire community a sense of being ‘British’ by sharing in the war effort.<Ref name="c2">Bond, pp. 97</ref>

In June 1940 about 13,500 evacuees were shipped to [[Casablanca]] in [[French Morocco]] but following the [[Capitulation (surrender)|capitulation]] of the [[France|French]] to the [[Nazi Germany|German]] armies in June 1940, the new Pro-German French Vichy Government found the presence of Gibraltarian evacuees in Casablanca an embarrassment and looked for ways for their removal.<Ref name="c2"/> The opportunity soon arose when 15 British [[cargo ship|cargo vessels]] arrived under Commodore Crichton repatriating 15,000 French servicemen who had been rescued from [[Battle of Dunkirk|Dunkirk]]. Once their own rescued servicemen had disembarked, the ships were arrested until they agreed to take away all the evacuees.<Ref name="c2"/> Although Crichton was unable to obtain permission to clean and restock his ships (and contrary to [[Admiralty|British Admiralty]] orders which forbade the taking on of evacuees) when he saw the mass of civilians pouring through the dockyards, he opened up his gangways for boarding.<Ref name="c2"/> These people were being herded towards the docks and forced to embark at bayonet point by French troops. However, when they arrived at Gibraltar, the [[Governor of Gibraltar |Governor]] would not allow them to land fearing that once on the Rock, it would be virtually impossible to evacuate them a second time.<Ref name="c1">Bond, pp. 98</ref>  Crowds gathered in John Macintosh square, in the centre of Gibraltar as the news broke, speeches were made and two [[Local government in the United Kingdom#Councils and councillors|City Councillors]] accompanied by the Acting President of the Exchange and Commercial Library went to see the Governor (Sir Clive Liddel) to ask that the evacuees be allowed to land. After receiving instructions from [[London]], a landing was allowed as long as the evacuees returned when other ships arrived to take them away from the Rock, and by [[13 July]] the re-evacuation back to Gibraltar had been completed. 

[[Image:Gibraltar Chronicle(1942).jpg|thumb|right|300px|The ''[[Gibraltar Chronicle]]'', dated [[December 2]], [[1942]].]]
[[Oliver Stanley]] agreed to accept the evacuees in the United Kingdom, but he argued with Gibraltar over the number of people involved. The Governor, he declared, had given the number of evacuees first as 13,000, then as 14,000 and finally as 16,000.<Ref name="c6">Garcia, pp. 15</ref> He asked for the situation to be clarified, stressing the shortage of accommodation in Britain and insisting that only 13,000 could be accepted, 2000 of whom were to be sent to the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] Atlantic island of [[Madeira]]. The situation, replied General Liddel on [[19 July]], ‘is that this is a fortress liable to heave and immediate attack and there should be no civilians here whereas there are 22,000. The 13,000 was the number sent to [[Morocco]], and more would have been sent had the situation there not altered.’<Ref name="c6"/> In London the evacuees were placed in the hands of the [[Ministry of Health]], and many were housed in [[Kensington]] area. Concern for them in Gibraltar mounted as the air raids against London intensified, coupled with the arrival of harrowing letters, describing the circumstances in which the evacuees were living.<ref>GGA, Evacuation 1940: General Mechanics of </ref>

In September rumours were already circulating among the evacuees, and in Gibraltar, that the possibility of re-evacuating the Gibraltarians once more was being mooted, this time the destination being [[Jamaica]], in the [[Caribbean|West Indies]]. After much contention, it was decided to send a party directly from Gibraltar to the island, and 1,093 evacuees left for Jamaica direct, on [[9 October]], with more following later on. However petitions followed and the demands were met, partly for strategic reasons and the lack of available shipping.<ref>Garcia, pp. 16</ref> The situation at the end of 1940, therefore, was that approximately 2,000 evacuees were in Jamaica and a lesser number in Madeira, with the bulk of around 10,000 housed in the London area.<ref>Garcia, pp. 16-17</ref>

The surrender of Italy in September 1943 lifted any possible objections to the return of the evacuees to the Rock. As a result a Resettlement Board was established in November, and at a meeting of the Board on [[8 February]] [[1944]] [[repatriation]] priorities were finally agreed.<Ref name="c6">Garcia, pp. 20</ref> On [[6 April]] [[1944]] the first group of 1367 repatriates arrived on the Rock directly from the United Kingdom and on [[28 May]], the first repatriation party left Madeira, and by the end of 1944 only 520 non-priority evacuees remained on the island.<Ref name="c6">Garcia, pp. 20</ref>

In London, home-comers were making claims on the evacuees’ wartime accommodation and 500 Gibraltarians were re-evacuated to [[Scotland]] and 3,000 to camps in [[Northern Ireland]].<Ref name="c3">Bond, pp. 100</ref> Although the Governor, Lt. General Sir Noel Mason-MacFarlane, fought valiantly on behalf of the evacuees and did not accept the lack of accommodation as a sufficient reason for the delays.<Ref name="c3"/> As late as 1947 there were still 2,000 in Irish camps. The last of the evacuees did not see the Rock again until 1951.<Ref name="c3"/>

==Royal Air Force involvement==
{{Sectstub}}
On [[25 September]] [[1939]],  [[No. 200 Group RAF|No 200 (Coastal) Group]] was formed as a subordinate formation to HQ RAF Mediterranean in control of [[No. 200 Squadron RAF]]. The Group's function was the control of [[Royal Air Force]] units operating from Gibraltar.  In late 1940 the Group was transferred to [[RAF Coastal Command|Coastal Command]].<ref name="uolib1">{{cite web|url=http://www.rafweb.org/Grp07.htm|title=Air of Authority - A History of RAF Organisation|publisher=Royal Air Force Organisation|accessdate=2007-07-04}}</ref>  Later a combined HQ was formed with the Royal Navy at the Tower in the dockyard, and commenced operations in early 1942.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafgibraltar/aboutus/hist.cfm|title=The History of RAF Gibraltar|publisher=Royal Air Force - Gibraltar|accessdate=2007-07-05}}</ref>

For the aerial attack on the harbour of Gibraltar forces are to be designated which will guarantee abundant success. For the subsequent operations against naval objectives and for support of the attack of the Rock mainly dive bombers units are to be transferred to Spain. Sufficient anti-aircraft artillery is to be allocated to the army units including its use against ground targets.<ref>{{cite book | last=Prior | first=Dorothy E. | coauthors= | year=2005 | month= | title=A short History of Loreto in Gibraltar  | publisher=DOMA | location=Gibraltar | isbn=0-9583016-0-3 | pages= }}</ref>

The Rock came through the war relatively unscathed but there was little doubt that [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] had made plans to capture Gibraltar.<Ref name="c4">Bond pp. 100-102</ref> The plan, codenamed ‘Felix’ was devised at the highest level of command and was signed by [[Adolf Hitler]].<Ref name="c4"/> It involved prompt entry through [[Spain]] (with or without permission) and driving the British out of the Western Mediterranean. With Gibraltar taken, the [[Strait of Gibraltar|Strait]] would be effectively closed to the Allies.<Ref name="c4"/> The Rock was to be heavily dive bombed by planes leaving France but landing afterwards at Spanish air bases. The final attack to seize Gibraltar was to be made by German troops alone, thus Spain was to be denied possession.<Ref name="c4"/> However, General [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]’s wavering neutrality caused Hitler to hesitate and with the opening of the war on the Russian front, Hitler was obliged to postpone plan ‘Felix’.<Ref name="c4"/>

==Operation Tracer==
A document came to light in the top secret files of the offices of British [[naval intelligence]] giving details of the plan, codenamed ''Operation Tracer'', which was hatched during the darkest days of the Second World War.<Ref name="c12">{{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1997 |month=October |title=Operation Tracer |journal=Gibraltar Magazine |volume= |issue= |pages= |id= |url= |accessdate= 2007-06-29 |quote= }}</ref>

Six men were to be sealed in a cave with only two small openings to the outside world and left with enough supplies for one year. They were told there would be no way out and anyone who died within the chamber would have to be embalmed and cemented into the walls. Only if Germany was defeated within a year would they be released.

The volunteers – two doctors, three signalmen and their leader – would run an observation post from the two 12 inch by 6 inch slits, one looking due east out over the Mediterranean and the other west over the Strait and the harbour and wireless back all shipping movements to the [[Admiralty|British Admiralty]].<Ref name="c12"/>

[[Image:Dr Bruce Cooper.jpg|righ|thumb|Dr Bruce Cooper in Gibraltar, 1942]]
The potential menace of Germany’s invasion was seen as a real threat and by late 1941, ideas for a series of secret observation posts first in Gibraltar and later in other places like [[Malta]] and [[Aden]] were put together as Operation Tracer.<Ref name="c12"/> 

Work at Gibraltar began immediately under Commander Geoffry Birley and his chief engineer Colonel Fordham. The site chosen at Lord Airey’s Battery on the southern tip of the Rock already had an existing tunnelling scheme for a shelter. 

Extensive trials of the equipment began in January 1942 under the eye of [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] radio expert Colonel Gambier-Parry. Much thought was also given to the type of men needed for such a strange and demanding task.

A member of [[Robert Falcon Scott|Scott]]’s ill-fated [[Terra Nova Expedition|expedition to the Antarctic]], Murray Levick was called up as Surgeon-Commander to advise on survival techniques.<Ref name="c12"/> There were practical matters such as diet, exercise, sanitation and clothing to consider as well as vital ‘psychology of the personnel’. 

The full team was in place by the end of summer 1942 and their cavern fully equipped and ready for occupation. A comprehensive manual was prepared on all aspects of the operation and it was considered that similar secret lookout posts should be prepared throughout the world in the event of future wars. However, Operation Tracer was never needed, as [[Adolf Hitler]] turned his attention away from Gibraltar and towards the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].<Ref name="c12"/> 

The operation had been clouded in mystery until the discovery of papers at the [[Public Records Office]] in [[Kew]] [[UK]]. In the 1960s details of the story were told to a journalist by his intelligence service contacts and he wrote these up as ‘Operation Monkey’ yet facts were very sparse.<Ref name="c12"/>

In 1997 'Stay Behind Cave' (as it was nicknamed) was discovered in Gibraltar by the ''Gibraltar Caving Group'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thepoormouth.blogspot.com/2007/02/backwaters-of-history-operation-tracer.html|title=Backwaters of history - Operation Tracer |publisher=The Poor Mouth|accessdate=2007-07-03}}</ref> but no account was ever obtained from anyone associated with the mission. The discovery happened when the group encountered a strong gust of wind in a tunnel. Further searching led them to carefully break through a wall into chambers which had never been used and had remained sealed for over 50 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discovergibraltar.com/mainlogo/mainfrm.htm|title=Operation Tracer - Stay Behind Cave|publisher=discoverGibraltar.com|accessdate=2007-07-05}}</ref>

In November 2006 Jim Crone and Sergeant Major Pete Jackson, senior tunnel guide with the [[Royal Gibraltar Regiment]], met possibly the only member of Operation Tracer still alive when they travelled to meet Dr. W. A. Bruce Cooper at his home in [[England]].

Cooper (92 at the time) provided an opportunity to shed light on the operation with his direct involvement in the mission as a [[Lieutenant|Surgeon-Lieutenant]] in the [[Royal Naval Reserve|Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve]] (RNVR). He recalled stories about his colleagues, his training, and his feelings about the task.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/article2456304.ece|title=Ulsterman unravels mystery history of wartime Gibraltar cave operation|publisher=The Belfast Telegraph|accessdate=2007-07-03}}</ref>

==War tunnels==
Given that Gibraltar was a small town with only a few defences protecting it, the solution was to build a massive series of tunnels and chambers inside the natural protection of the [[Rock of Gibraltar]]. This town inside the rock contained its own power station, water supply, and hospital.<Ref name="gov">{{cite web|url=http://www.gibraltar.gov.gi/tourism/great_siege.htm|title=The Great Siege Tunnels|publisher=Government of Gibraltar|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref> Some soldiers posted here would not see the light of day for months on end. Royal Engineers (originally the Artificer Company during the Great Siege) along with a Canadian contingent added some 30 miles (45 km) of such tunnels.<Ref name="gov"/>

==Operation Torch and General Eisenhower on the Rock==
{{Main|Operation Torch}}
[[Image:GibraltarWWII.gif|right|thumb|250px|The [[Strait of Gibraltar]]]]
Following the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], by mid-1942 plans for the Allied counter offensive were well under way. Gibraltar was to play a crucial part in those plans. It had been realised that an invasion of Europe in 1943 would be impracticable, but the allies could, as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] expressed it, attack the "soft underbelly of Europe" through the [[Mediterranean]]. The plan, code named [[Operation Torch]], which was hatched between [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] and Churchill, was to occupy French North Africa as a springboard from which attacks could be launched to drive Italy out of the war.<Ref name="c10">{{cite web|url=http://www.gibraltar.gov.gi/latest_news/topical_speeches/operation_torch.htm|title=Address by the Hon P.R. Caruana QC on the occasion of a plaque unveiling ceremony to commemorate 'Operation Torch'|publisher=Government of Gibraltar|accessdate=2007-07-01}}</ref> 

In July 1942 Major General (later President) [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Dwight Eisenhower]] was appointed Allied Commander-in-Chief of Operation Torch. Churchill placed Gibraltar under the command of General Eisenhower as the temporary headquarters for this, the first large-scale Anglo-American operation of the war. He arrived in Gibraltar on [[5 November]] [[1942]] to take over, not just command of Operation Torch itself, but also military command of Gibraltar.<Ref name="c10"/>

General Eisenhower stayed at ''the Convent'' (now the [[Governor of Gibraltar|Governor]]'s residence), but his operational headquarters were in a small chamber in a tunnel in the heart of the [[Rock of Gibraltar|Rock]]. In his memoirs General Eisenhower wrote: 

{{cquote|The subterranean passages under the Rock provided the sole available office space, and in them was located the signal equipment by which we expected to keep in touch with the commanders of the three assault forces. The eternal darkness of the tunnels was here and there partially pierced by feeble electric bulbs. Damp, cold air in block-long passages was heavy with stagnation and did not noticeably respond to the clattering efforts of electric fans. Through the arched ceilings came a constant drip, drip, drip of surface water that faithfully but drearily ticked off the seconds of the interminable, almost unendurable, wait which always occurs between completion of a military plan and the moment action begins.<Ref name="c10"/>}}

100,000 soldiers on the high seas in a multitude of transports converged on Gibraltar. More than 400 aircraft of all types were crammed into the dispersal areas around the Gibraltar runway. Fighters had been shipped in crates and assembled on the airfield. Every available area of storage was taken up with [[ammunition]], fuel, and other essential supplies. 168 [[United States|American]] pilots were housed in the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] messes at ''North Front''.<Ref name="c10"/>

On [[8 November]] [[1942]], 466 aircraft from Gibraltar landed on captured North African airfields.

From their headquarters in Gibraltar, Lieutenant General Dwight David Eisenhower (United States Army), and Admiral Sir Andrew Browne Cunningham (Royal Navy), directed Operation Torch, the first major combined combat operation during World War II involving American and British forces.<Ref name="c10"/>

==Death of Władysław Sikorski==
[[Image:SikorskiPlane 1943.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Sikorski's Liberator, lying on its back with its wheels just having started to retract, in the sea just off Gibraltar following the crash (1943).]]
On [[July 4]], [[1943]], a [[B-24 Liberator|Liberator bomber]] from [[RAF Transport Command]] took off from Gibraltar for England. On board was General [[Władysław Sikorski]], Prime Minister of Poland's London-based government in exile and [[Commander-in-Chief]] of its armed forces, returning from visiting Polish troops in the Middle East. 

The aircraft climbed normally from the runway, levelled off to gather speed but then suddenly lost height and crashed into the harbour. The 62-year-old general died, along with 15 others. The sole survivor was the Czech-born pilot, Max Prchal, who was rescued by an RAF launch. The bodies of five passengers and crew, including Sikorski's daughter, were never found.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fpp.co.uk/History/Sikorski/Times040703.html|title=Real History and the Death of General Sikorski|publisher=The Times|accessdate=2007-06-30}}</ref>

In 1943 a British Court of Inquiry investigated the crash of Sikorski's [[B-24 Liberator|Liberator II]] ''AL523'', but was unable to determine the probable cause, finding only that it was an accident<ref>Stanczyk, Zbigniew L., [http://www.dziennik.com/www/dziennik/kult/archiwum/07-12-02/pp-09-13-02.html "Tajemnica gen. Sikorskiego"], ''Przegląd Polski Online", [[7 December]] [[2002]], in Polish, retrieved [[July 31]], [[2007]]</ref> and the "aircraft became uncontrollable for reasons which cannot be established". A popular theory was insufficient technical maintenance leading to jamming aircraft controls.<ref>{{pl icon}} Various authors.

Official publication of the Polish government Agency of Combatants and Repressed</ref> Despite this finding, the political context of the event, coupled with a variety of curious circumstances, immediately gave rise to speculation that Sikorski's death had been no accident, and may in fact have been the direct result of a Soviet, British or even Polish conspiracy.<ref name="BBC'06">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5307448.stm|title='Polish soldier's 'fishy' sabotage tale'|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2007-06-30}}</ref>

Six weeks before the crash, while Sikorski had been at Gibraltar for the first time, en route to his Middle East inspection, a Polish government office in London received a phone call stating that Sikorski had been killed in a crash at Gibraltar; the call had been discounted as a prank, but has since led to speculation. It is often mentioned that two of Sikorski's previous planes had been subject to incidents. The [[November 30]], [[1942]], forced landing at [[Montreal]], [[Canada]], was suspected to have been caused by sabotage. Another incident might have taken place few months earlier, in March.<ref name="BBC'06"/> At Gibraltar, due to the special treatment accorded [[Very Important Person (person)|VIPs]], there was uncertainty about who had in fact boarded the plane and about the exact cargo manifest &mdash; all leading to uncertainty as to the identity of the bodies recovered from the crash site; some bodies, including that of Sikorski's daughter, Zofia, have never been recovered.<ref name="Wprost-Z">{{pl icon}} [http://www.wprost.pl/ar/?O=71300 Baliszewski, Dawid, "Bransoletka Zofii" ("Zofia's Bracelet"), ''Tygodnik Wprost'', no. 1152 ([[December 31]], [[2004]])], retrieved [[July 31]], [[2007]].</ref>
