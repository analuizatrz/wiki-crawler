"'''Rich Girl'''" is a [[pop music|pop]]-[[ragga]] song performed by singer [[Gwen Stefani]] featuring [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]]. The song was primarily written by [[Dr. Dre]], Eve, and Stefani, with other collaborators for Stefani's debut solo album ''[[Love. Angel. Music. Baby]]'' (2004). "Rich Girl" is based on the [[Louchie Lou and Michie One]] song of the same name, which is an adaptation of the ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'' song "[[If I Were a Rich Man (song)|If I Were a Rich Man]]". In the song, Stefani discusses her dreams of fame and riches from the perspective of "when she was just an [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] girl".<ref name="ocr">Wener, Ben.

Retrieved [[May 2]], [[2007]].</ref>

The last song to be included on the album,<ref name="express"/> "Rich Girl" was released as the album's second [[single (music)|single]] in late 2004 (see [[2004 in music]]) to mixed reviews from music critics. It was a commercial success, reaching the top ten on the majority of the [[record chart|chart]]s it entered, and topped the singles chart in [[Argentina]]. In the [[United States]], "Rich Girl" was certified double platinum, and it received a nomination for [[Best Rap/Sung Collaboration]] at the [[48th Grammy Awards]].

==Writing process==
Gwen Stefani and Eve had previously collaborated together on the 2001 single "[[Let Me Blow Ya Mind]]."

After playing some of the songs on which she had been working, Dr. Dre told her, "You don't want to go back there."  Instead of using one of the tracks, Dr. Dre instead suggested using [[reggae]] duo Louchie Lou and Michie One's 1993 song "Rich Girl," which itself interpolated "[[If I Were a Rich Man (song)|If I Were a Rich Man]]" from the 1964 musical ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]''.<ref name="scared"/> Stefani and Eve helped each other with their parts, but when they presented Dr. Dre with the [[demo (music)|demo]], he told them to rewrite the song,<ref name="scared"/> suggesting that Stefani play a character in the song.<ref name="express"/>

Since she had not seen the musical since she was a child, Stefani went to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] to better understand the theme that "even if you're poor and you have love, you're rich."<ref name="express"/> The idea which became the final version came to Stefani while [[brainstorming]] on her [[treadmill]].<ref name="scared"/> She commented that the troubles in writing the song came because "Dre was really pushing me to write in a new way," but when she presented him with the song, "he just totally tricked the track out."<ref>[http://www.rebelwaltz.com/gwen_stefani.html "Gwen Stefani"].
