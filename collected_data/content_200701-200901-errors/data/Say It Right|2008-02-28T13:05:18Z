"'''Say It Right'''" is a song written by [[Nelly Furtado]], [[Timbaland|Timothy "Timbaland" Mosley]] and [[Nate Hills|Nate "Danja" Hills]] for Furtado's third album, ''[[Loose (album)|Loose]]'' (2006). It was co-produced by Timbaland and Danja and released as the album's third [[single (music)|single]] in [[North America]] and [[Australia]] (see [[2006 in music]]). The song served as the album's fourth single in [[Europe]] and [[Asia]], and it was released digitally in the [[United Kingdom]] in March 2007. It was the album's fifth single in [[Latin America]].

The song received a nomination for [[Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] at the [[50th Annual Grammy Awards]].<ref name=Grammydotcom>[http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/50th_Show/list.aspx "50th Annual Grammy Awards Nominations List"]. Grammy.com.</ref>

==Background, style and subject matter==
[[Image:Say_It_Right_MusicSheet.jpg|300px|left|thumb|Say It Right Music Sheet]]
The process of creating the song began in the recording studio one morning at around 4:00 a.m., when Timbaland recommended that Furtado go home because she was tired. Furtado, who had heard that the band [[U2]] wrote many of their songs in the studio control room, said "Really? I'll show you", put on her [[hoodie]] and began to "[[jam session|jam]]".<ref name="RS">Scaggs, Austin. [http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10603268/why_is_nelly_furtados_new_album_so_loud "Why Is Nelly Furtado's New Album So Loud?"]. ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. [[June 19]] [[2006]]. Retrieved [[December 30]] [[2006]].</ref> Nate Hills and Timbaland soon joined her, writing and producing as they went, and according to Furtado, this process intensified as she sang. The team used four microphones in the live room and moved them around during recording, about which Furtado said, "...when you listen to it&mdash;there's a lot of dimension. It kind of sounds like [Timbaland is] in another country".<ref name="RS"/> Afterwards, they picked the best vocals and "perfected" them, before inserting "reverbs and weird alien sounds" onto them. "[W]e experimented a lot with depth and different sounds", Furtado said of the making of the song. "[It] affected my vocals a whole lot."<ref name="RS"/> 
"Say It Right" is performed with a moderate techno groove and is written in [[F minor]]. It is set in [[common time]]; in 4/4 count. The melody follows the major chord Fm&ndash;E♭/F&ndash;D♭/F&ndash;B♭m/F. Furtado's vocal range spans from Ab3 to F5.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=MN0056652 |last= |first= |title=Nelly Furtado Digital Sheet Music: Say It Right |work=Musicnotes.com |publisher=Musicnotes, Inc. |date= |accessdate=2008-01-28}}</ref> Furtado has cited the "spooky, [[electronic keyboard|keyboard]]-driven pop sound" of the band [[Eurythmics]], particularly their 1983 song "[[Here Comes the Rain Again]]", as an influence on "Say It Right" and other tracks on ''Loose''. "I'm not 100 percent sure what ["Here Comes the Rain Again" is] about, but it always takes me away to another place, and I love it", she said.<ref name="umusic">[http://umusic.ca/nellyfurtado/ "Nelly Furtado"]. [[Universal Music]] Canada. Retrieved [[December 30]] [[2006]].</ref>

In fact the song deals with [[Mysticism|mystic]] or [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] experiences as she explains in an interview in 2007. "It is a kind of a magical song. It has a mystery to it, that I have not quite figured out. It has a haunting twist to it." <ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIA1vvDERHg Nelly Furtado in an interview] at [[YouTube]]</ref>
In other interviews she said that she does not really know what "Say It Right" is about, "but it captures the feeling I had when I wrote it, and it taps into this other sphere."<ref name="umusic"/> In an interview for ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'', it was mentioned that it is about her breakup with DJ Jasper Gahunia, the father of her daughter.<ref>Cairns, Dan.

''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine called the song "a [[Pussycat Dolls]]-inspired contempo jam, high on hooks and of-the-moment production.

The clip starts with a helicopter landing on a black helipad bearing Furtado's name on top of a building, and Furtado getting out. She is shown on the roof of the building throughout the video, with the [[Los Angeles]] skyline in the background. The video features mostly face shots of her and Timbaland intercut with shots of dancers. Furtado described the clip as "a throwback to the '80s ... the more surreal side" because the shots of her and Timbaland reminded her much of those of [[Annie Lennox]] and [[David A. Stewart|Dave Stewart]] in videos for Eurythmics' singles, and "the strange relationship [they] had, where ... you get this intense vibe from it. And Tim and me, we're partners, we vibe on a serious creative level, so the video captures that energy."<ref name="MTV-Nov2006"/> The video ends with Furtado climbing back into the helicopter, which flies off.
