also known as '''Jesus Christ''', is the central figure of [[Christianity]], revered by most [[Christian]]s as the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation of God]], and is also an important figure in several other [[religion]]s.

The name "Jesus" is an [[Anglicisation|Anglicization]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{Polytonic|Ίησους}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|Iēsous}}''), itself a [[Hellenization]] of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] {{lang|he|יהושע}} (''Yehoshua'') or Hebrew-[[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] {{lang|he|ישוע}} (''[[Yeshua (name)|Yeshua]]''), meaning "[[Tetragrammaton|YHWH]] rescues".

The main sources of information regarding Jesus' life and teachings are the [[gospel]]s. Most scholars in the fields of [[history]] and [[biblical studies]] agree that Jesus was a [[Galilee|Galilean]] [[Jew]], was regarded as a teacher and [[faith healing|healer]], was [[baptism|baptized]] by [[John the Baptist]], and was [[crucifixion|crucified]] in [[Jerusalem]] on orders of [[Roman governor|Roman Governor]] [[Pontius Pilate]], on the charge of [[sedition]] against the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>[[Raymond E.

[[Christian views of Jesus]] (see also [[Christology]]) center on the belief that Jesus is [[Christology|divine]], is the [[Christ|Messiah]] whose coming was [[Claimed Messianic prophecies of Jesus|prophesied in the Old Testament]], and that he was [[Death and resurrection of Jesus|resurrected]] after his crucifixion. Christians predominantly believe that Jesus is the "[[Son of God]]" (meaning that he is [[God the Son]], the second person in the [[Trinity]]), who came to provide [[Salvation#Christianity|salvation]] and [[Confession|reconciliation]] with [[God]]. Other Christian beliefs include Jesus' [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]], performance of [[Miracles attributed to Jesus|miracles]], [[Ascension of Jesus|ascension]] into [[Heaven]], and future [[Second Coming]]. While the doctrine of the Trinity is widely accepted by Christians, a small minority instead hold various [[Nontrinitarianism|nontrinitarian]] beliefs concerning the divinity of Jesus.

In [[Islam]], Jesus ({{lang-ar|عيسى}}, commonly transliterated as [[Jesus in Islam|Isa]]) is considered one of [[God in Islam|God]]'s important [[Prophets in Islam|prophets]],<ref>James Leslie Houlden, "Jesus: The Complete Guide", Continuum International Publishing Group, 2005, ISBN 082648011X</ref><ref>Prof. Dr. Şaban Ali Düzgün, "[http://www.diyanet.gov.tr/english/web_kitap.asp?yid=30 Uncovering Islam: Questions and Answers about Islamic Beliefs and Teachings]", Ankara: The Presidency of Religious Affairs Publishing, 2004</ref> a bringer of scripture, a worker of miracles, and the [[Messiah]].

== Chronology ==
{{main|Chronology of Jesus}}
Scholars do not know the exact year or date of Jesus' birth or death. The Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke place Jesus' birth under the reign of Herod the Great, who died in 4 BC/BCE,<ref>Edwin D. Freed, ''Stories of Jesus' Birth'', (Continuum International, 2004), page 119.</ref> although the Gospel of Luke also describes the birth as taking place during the [[Census of Quirinius|first census]] of the Roman provinces of [[History of Syria#Syria in antiquity|Syria]] and [[Iudaea Province|Iudaea]] in 6 AD/CE.<ref>Geza Vermes, ''The Nativity: History and Legend'', London, Penguin, 2006, page 22.</ref> Scholars generally assume a date of birth between 6 and 4 BC/BCE.<ref>James D. G. Dunn, Jesus Remembered, Eerdmans Publishing (2003), page 324.</ref> Jesus' ministry followed that of John the Baptist.<ref>Luke states that John's ministry began in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod was tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip was tetrarch of the region of Iturea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene, during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas.</ref>
The Gospels name Pontius Pilate as the Roman prefect that had Jesus crucified, and Pilate was prefect of Iudea between 26 and 36 AD/CE.<ref>Joel B. Green, The Gospel of Luke, (Eerdmans, 1997), page 168.</ref>

The common Western standard for numbering years, in which the current year is {{CURRENTYEAR}}, is based on an early medieval attempt to count the years from Jesus' birth. 

While [[Christmas]], in honor of Jesus' birth, is celebrated [[December 25]], there is no indication that this was his actual birthday. Jesus died after [[Passover]], a Jewish holiday occurring in northern spring. Christians commemorate Jesus' death at this time of year, on [[Good Friday]].

== Life and teachings, as told in the Gospels ==
{{main|New Testament view on Jesus' life}}

The [[Bible]]'s four [[biblical canon|canonical]] [[gospel]]s are the main sources for the traditional [[Christian]] biography of Jesus' life. Scholars, although considering the gospel accounts to be [[historical method|historically useful]], differ widely as to their reliability. Each gospel portrays Jesus' life and its meaning differently.<ref name ="Harris">[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], Understanding the Bible.

=== Genealogy and family ===
{{main|Genealogy of Jesus|Desposyni}}

[[Image:Czestochowska.jpg|thumb|left|165px|Jesus and Mary: [[Black Madonna of Częstochowa]]]]

Of the four gospels, only Matthew and Luke give accounts of Jesus' genealogy. The accounts in the two gospels are substantially different, and various theories have been proposed to explain the discrepancies.<ref>Joseph A. Fitzmyer, The Gospel According to Luke I-IX. Anchor Bible. Garden City: Doubleday, 1981, pp. 499–500; I. Howard Marshall, The Gospel of Luke (The New International Greek Testament Commentary). Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1978, p. 158;</ref> Both accounts, however, trace his line back to [[David|King David]] and from there to [[Abraham]]. These lists are identical between Abraham and David, but they differ between David and Joseph. Matthew starts with [[Solomon]] and proceeds through the kings of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] to the last king, [[Jeconiah]]. After Jeconiah, the line of kings terminated when [[Babylonian captivity|Babylon conquered Judah]]. Thus, Matthew shows that Jesus is the legal heir to the throne of [[Land of Israel|Israel]]. Luke's genealogy is longer than Matthew's; it goes back to [[Adam and Eve|Adam]] and provides more names between David and Jesus.

<!-- The way Joseph's fatherhood is not expressed or expressed is the result of a long discussion attain consensus. Please do not change without reading and discussion. -->
[[Joseph of Nazareth|Joseph]], husband of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]], appears in descriptions of Jesus' childhood. No mention, however, is made of Joseph during the ministry of Jesus.

The New Testament books of Matthew, Mark, and Galatians tell of Jesus' relatives, including what may have been brothers and sisters.<ref>{{niv|Matthew|13:55–56|Matthew 13:55–56}}, {{niv|Mark|6:3|Mark 6:3}}, and {{niv|Galatians|1:19|Galatians 1:19}}</ref> The Greek word ''adelphos'' in these verses, often translated as ''brother'', can refer to any familial relation, and most Catholics and Eastern Orthodox Christians translate the word as ''kinsman'' or ''cousin'' in this context (see [[Perpetual virginity of Mary]]). Luke also mentions that [[Elizabeth (Biblical person)|Elizabeth]], mother of John the Baptist, was a "cousin" or "relative" of Mary ({{niv|Luke|1:36|Luke 1:36}}), which would make John a distant cousin of Jesus.

=== Nativity and early life ===
{{main|Annunciation|Nativity of Jesus|Child Jesus}}

[[Image:Gerard van Honthorst 002.jpg|thumb|left|175px|''Adoration of the Shepherds'', [[Gerard van Honthorst]], 17th century]]

According to Matthew and Luke, Jesus was born in [[Bethlehem]] of [[Judea]] to Mary, a virgin, by a miracle of the [[Holy Spirit]]. The Gospel of Luke gives an account of the [[angel]] [[Gabriel]] visiting Mary to tell her that she was chosen to bear the [[Son of God]] ({{niv|Luke|1:26–38|Luke 1:26–38}}). According to Luke, an order of [[Augustus|Caesar Augustus]] had forced Mary and Joseph to leave their homes in [[Nazareth]] and come to the home of Joseph's ancestors, the house of [[David]], for the [[Census of Quirinius]].

After Jesus' birth, the couple was forced to use a [[manger]] in place of a crib because of a shortage of accommodation ({{niv|Luke|2:1–7|Luke 2:1–7}}). According to Luke, an angel announced Jesus' birth to shepherds who left their flocks to see the newborn child and who subsequently publicized what they had witnessed throughout the area (see [[The First Noël]]). Matthew tells of the "[[Biblical Magi|Wise Men]]" or "[[Magi]]" who brought gifts to the infant Jesus after following a star which they believed was a sign that the [[King of the Jews]] had been born ({{niv|Matthew|2:1–12|Matthew 2:1–12}}).

Jesus' childhood home is identified as the town of [[Nazareth]] in [[Galilee]]. Except for a [[Flight into Egypt|journey to Egypt]] by his family in his infancy to escape Herod's [[Massacre of the Innocents]] and a short trip to [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Sidon]] (in what is now Lebanon), the Gospels place all other events in Jesus' life in [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|ancient Israel]].<ref>''For Egypt'': {{niv|Matthew|2:13–23|Matthew 2:13–23}}; ''For Tyre and sometimes Sidon'':{{niv|Matthew|15:21–28|Matthew 15:21–28}} and {{niv|Mark|7:24–30|Mark 7:24–3}}</ref> According to Matthew, the family remained in Egypt until Herod's death, whereupon they returned to Nazareth to avoid living under the authority of Herod's son and successor [[Herod Archelaus|Archelaus]] ({{niv|Matthew|2:19–23|Matthew 2:19–23}}).

Only Luke tells that Jesus was found teaching in the temple by his parents after being lost. The [[Finding in the Temple]] ({{niv|Luke|2:41–52|Luke 2:41–52}}) is the only event between Jesus' infancy and baptism mentioned in any of the canonical Gospels. According to Luke, Jesus was "about thirty years of age" when he was baptized ({{niv|Luke|3:23|Luke 3:23}}). In Mark, Jesus is called a carpenter. Matthew says he was a carpenter's son, suggesting to some that Jesus may have spent some of his first 30 years practicing carpentry with his father ({{niv|Mark|6:3|Mark 6:3}}, {{niv|Matthew|13:55|Matthew 13:55}}).

=== Baptism and Temptation ===
{{main|Baptism of Jesus|Temptation of Jesus|John the Baptist}}

[[Image:Ary Scheffer - The Temptation of Christ (1854).jpg|thumb|right|175px|''Temptation of Christ'', [[Ary Scheffer]], 19th c.]]

All three [[synoptic Gospels]] describe the [[Baptism of Jesus]] by [[John the Baptist]], an event which Biblical scholars describe as the beginning of Jesus' public ministry. According to these accounts, Jesus came to the [[Jordan River]] where John the Baptist had been preaching and baptizing people in the crowd. Matthew describes John as initially hesitant to comply with Jesus' request for John to baptize him, stating that it was Jesus who should baptize him. Jesus persisted, "It is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness" ({{niv|Matthew|3:15|Matthew 3:15}}). After Jesus was baptized and rose from the water, Mark states Jesus "saw the heavens parting and the Spirit descending upon Him like a dove. Then a voice came from heaven saying: 'You are My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased'" ({{nkjv|Mark|1:10–11|Mark 1:10–11}}). The Gospel of John does not describe the baptism, but it does attest that Jesus is the very one about whom John the Baptist had been preaching — the Son of God.

Following his baptism, Jesus was led into the desert by God where he [[fasting|fasted]] for forty days and forty nights ({{niv|Matthew|4:1–2|Matthew 4:1–2}}). During this time, the [[Devil in Christianity|devil]] appeared to him and tempted Jesus three times. Each time, Jesus refused temptation with a quotation of [[scripture]] from the [[Book of Deuteronomy]]. The devil departed and angels came and brought nourishment to Jesus ({{niv|Matthew|4:1–11|Matthew 4:1–11}}, {{niv|Mark|1:12–13|Mark 1:12–13}}, {{niv|Luke|4:1–13|Luke 4:1–13}}).

=== Ministry ===
{{main|Ministry of Jesus|Sermon on the Mount|Sermon on the Plain|Twelve Apostles|Transfiguration of Jesus}}

[[Image:Bloch-SermonOnTheMount.jpg|left|thumb|250px|''Sermon on the Mount'', [[Carl Heinrich Bloch]], 19th c.]]

The Gospels state that Jesus, as Messiah, came to "give his life as a ransom for many" and "preach the good news of the [[Kingdom of God]]."<ref>{{niv|Mark|10:45|Mark 10:45}}, {{niv|Luke|4:43|Luke 4:43}}, {{niv|John|20:31|John 20:31}}.</ref> Over the course of his ministry, Jesus is said to have [[Miracles of Jesus|performed various miracles]], including healings, [[exorcism]]s, [[walking on water]], [[turning water into wine]], and raising several people, such as [[Lazarus]], from the dead ({{niv|John|11:1–44|John 11:1–44}}, {{niv|Matthew|9:25|Matthew 9:25}}, and {{niv|Luke|7:15|Luke 7:15}}).

[[Image:First century palestine.gif|thumb|200px|right|Judæa and Galilee at the time of Jesus]]

The Gospel of John describes three different [[passover]] feasts over the course of Jesus' ministry. This implies that Jesus preached for a period of at least "two years plus a month or two",<ref>Meier 1991 vol. 1:405</ref> although some interpretations of the [[Synoptic Gospels]] suggest a span of only one year.<ref>"The Thompson Chain-Reference Study Bible NIV," published December 1999, B.B. Kirkbride Bible Co., Inc.; William Adler & Paul Tuffin, "The Chronography of George Synkellos: A Byzantine Chronicle of Universal History from the Creation," Oxford University Press (2002), p. 466</ref> The focus of his ministry was toward his closest adherents, the [[Twelve Apostles]], though many of his followers were considered [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]]. The Twelve Apostles and others closest to Jesus were all Jews as shown by Jesus’ statements that his mission is directed only to those of the house of Israel ({{niv|Matthew|15:24|Matthew 15:24}}, {{niv|Matthew|10:1-6|Matthew 10:1-6}}) and by the fact that only after the death of Jesus did the apostles agree with Paul that the teaching of the gospel could be extended to uncircumcised Gentiles ({{niv|Acts|15:1–31|Acts 15:1–31}}, {{niv|Galatians|2:7–9|Galatians 2:7-9}}, {{niv|Acts|10:1–11:19|Acts 10:1–11:18}}). Jesus led an [[Apocalypse|apocalyptic]] following. He preached that the [[End times|end of the current world]] would come unexpectedly, and that he would return to judge the world, especially according to [[The Sheep and the Goats|how they treated the vulnerable]]; for this reason, he called on his followers to be ever alert and faithful. Jesus also taught that repentance was necessary to escape [[hell]], and promised to give those who believe in him eternal life ({{niv|John|3:16–18|John 3:16–18}}).

At the height of his ministry, Jesus attracted huge crowds numbering in the thousands, primarily in the areas of [[Galilee]] and Perea (in modern-day [[Israel]] and [[Jordan]] respectively).<ref>In ''John'', Jesus' ministry takes place in and around Jerusalem.</ref> Some of Jesus' most famous teachings come from the [[Sermon on the Mount]], which contained the [[Beatitudes]] and the [[Lord's Prayer]]. Jesus often employed [[Parables of Jesus|parables]], such as the [[Parable of the Prodigal Son]] and the [[Parable of the Sower]]. His teachings encouraged unconditional self-sacrificing [[agape|God-like love]] for God and for all people. During his sermons, he preached about service and humility, the forgiveness of sin, faith, [[Turn the other cheek|turning the other cheek]], [[Expounding of the Law#Love|love for one's enemies]] as well as friends, and the need to follow the spirit of [[Torah|the law]] in addition to the letter.<ref>''Sermon on the Mount'': {{niv|Matthew|5–7|Matthew 5–7}}; ''Prodigal Son'': {{niv|Luke|15:11–32|Luke 15:11–32}}; ''Parable of the Sower'': {{niv|Matthew|13:1–9|Matthew 13:1–9}}; ''Agape'': {{niv|Matthew|22:34–40|Matthew 22:34–40}}.</ref>

Jesus often met with society's outcasts, such as the [[publicani]] (Imperial tax collectors who were despised for extorting money), including the apostle [[Matthew the Evangelist|Matthew]]; when the [[Pharisees]] objected to Jesus' meeting with sinners rather than the righteous, Jesus replied that it was the sick who need a physician, not the healthy ({{niv|Matthew|9:9–13|Matthew 9:9–13}}). According to Luke and John, Jesus also made efforts to extend his ministry to the [[Samaritans]], who followed [[Samaritanism|a different form]] of the Israelite religion. This is reflected in his preaching to the Samaritans of [[Sychar]], resulting in their conversion ({{niv|John|4:1–42|John 4:1–42}}).

According to the synoptic gospels, Jesus led three of [[Twelve Apostles|his apostles]] — [[Simon Peter|Peter]], [[John the Apostle|John]], and [[James the Great|James]] — to the top of a mountain to pray. While there, he was [[Transfiguration of Jesus|transfigured]] before them, his face shining like the sun and his clothes brilliant white; [[Elijah]] and [[Moses]] appeared adjacent to him. A bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the sky said, "This is my beloved son, with whom I am well pleased."<ref>{{niv|Matthew|17:1–6|Matthew 17:1–6}}, {{niv|Mark|9:1–8|Mark 9:1–8}}, {{niv|Luke|9:28–36|Luke 9:28–36}}</ref> The gospels also state that toward the end of his ministry, Jesus began to warn his disciples of his future death and resurrection ({{niv|Matthew|16:21–28|Matthew 16:21–28}}).

===Arrest, trial, and death===
{{main|Jesus and the Money Changers|Last Supper|Arrest of Jesus|Sanhedrin Trial of Jesus|Death of Jesus}}

In the account given by the synoptic gospels, Jesus came with his followers to Jerusalem during the Passover festival where a large crowd came to meet him, shouting, "[[Hosanna]]! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Blessed is the King of Israel!"<ref>The crowd was quoting {{niv|Psalms|118:26|Psalms 118:26}}; found in {{niv|John|12:13–16|John 12:13–16}}.</ref> Following his [[triumphal entry]],<ref>John puts the cleansing of the temple at the start of Jesus' ministry.</ref> Jesus created a disturbance at [[Herod's Temple]] by [[Jesus and the Money Changers|overturning the tables of the moneychangers]] who set up shop there, and claiming that they had made the Temple a "den of robbers." ({{niv|Mark|11:17|Mark 11:17}}). Later that week, Jesus celebrated the [[Passover|Passover meal]] with his disciples — an event subsequently known as the [[Last Supper]] — in which he prophesied that he would be betrayed by one of his disciples, and would then be executed. In this ritual he took bread and wine in hand, saying: "this is my body which is given for you" and "this cup which is poured out for you is the New Covenant in my blood," and instructed them to "do this in [[Eucharist|remembrance]] of me" ({{niv|Luke|22:7–20|Luke 22:7–20}}). Following the supper, Jesus and his disciples went to pray in the [[Garden of Gethsemane]].
 
While in the Garden, Jesus was [[Arrest of Jesus|arrested]] by temple guards on the orders of the [[Sanhedrin]] and the high priest, [[Caiaphas]] ({{niv|Luke|22:47–52|Luke 22:47–52}}, {{niv|Matthew|26:47–56|Matthew 26:47–56}}). The arrest took place clandestinely at night to avoid a riot, as Jesus was popular with the people at large ({{niv|Mark|14:2|Mark 14:2}}). [[Judas Iscariot]], one of his apostles, betrayed Jesus by identifying him to the guards with [[The Kiss of Judas|a kiss]]. Simon Peter, another one of Jesus' apostles, used a sword to attack one of Jesus' captors, cutting off his ear, which, according to Luke, Jesus immediately healed miraculously.<ref>The apostle is identified as [[Saint Peter|Simon Peter]] in {{niv|john|18:10|John 18:10}}; the healing of the ear is found in {{niv|luke|22:51|Luke 22:51}}.</ref> Jesus rebuked the apostle, stating "all they that take the sword shall perish by the sword" ({{niv|Matthew|26:52|Matthew 26:52}}). After his arrest, Jesus' apostles went into hiding.

[[Image:Cristo Velázquez lou2.jpg|thumb|left|175px|''[[Crucifixion]]'', [[Diego Velázquez]], 17th c.]]

During the [[Sanhedrin Trial of Jesus]], the high priests and elders asked Jesus, "Are you the [[Son of God]]?" When he replied, "You are right in saying I am," they condemned Jesus for [[blasphemy]] ({{niv|luke|22:70–71|Luke 22:70–71}}). The high priests then turned him over to the Roman [[List of Kings of Judea#Roman Procurators|procurator]] [[Pontius Pilate]], based on an accusation of [[sedition]] for forbidding the payment of taxes [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2023:1-2;&version=8; Luke 23:1-2] and claiming to be King of the Jews.<ref>{{niv|Matthew|27:11|Matthew 27:11}}; {{niv|Mark|15:2|Mark 15:12}}.</ref> When Jesus came before Pilate, Pilate asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?" to which he replied, "It is as you say." According to the Gospels, Pilate personally felt that Jesus was not guilty of any crime against the Romans, and since there was a custom at Passover for the Roman governor to free a prisoner (a custom not recorded outside the Gospels), Pilate offered the crowd a choice between Jesus of Nazareth and an insurrectionist named [[Barabbas]]. The crowd chose to have Barabbas freed and Jesus crucified. Pilate washed his hands to indicate that he was innocent of the injustice of the decision ({{niv|Matthew|27:11–26|Matthew 27:11–26}}).

According to all four Gospels, Jesus died before late afternoon at [[Calvary]], which was also called Golgotha. The wealthy Judean [[Joseph of Arimathea]], a member of the [[Sanhedrin]] according to Mark and Luke, received Pilate's permission to take possession of Jesus' body, placing it in a tomb.<ref>{{niv|Mark|15:42–46|Mark 15:42–46}}; {{niv|Luke|23:50–56|Luke 23:50–56}}.</ref> According to John, Joseph was aided by [[Nicodemus]], who joined him to help bury Jesus, and who appears in other parts of John's gospel ({{niv|John|19:38–42|John 19:38–42}}). The three Synoptic Gospels tell of the [[crucifixion eclipse|darkening of the sky]] from twelve until three that afternoon; Matthew also mentions an [[earthquake]] ({{niv|Matthew|27:51|Matthew 27:51}}).

[[Image:Grunewald - christ.jpg|thumb|right|175px|''Christ en majesté'', [[Matthias Grünewald]], 16th c.: [[Resurrection of Jesus]]]]

According to the Gospels, Jesus [[resurrection of Jesus|rose from the dead]] on the third day after his [[crucifixion]].<ref name="Resurrection">{{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Matthew |chapter=28|verse=5|range=-10}}; {{niv|mark|16:9|Mark 16:9}}; {{niv|luke|24:12–16|Luke 24:12–16}}; {{niv|John|20:10–17|John 20:10–17}}; {{niv|Acts|2:24|Acts 2:24}}; {{niv|1Cor|6:14|1Cor 6:14}}</ref> The Gospel of Matthew states that an angel appeared near the tomb of Jesus and announced his resurrection to [[Mary Magdelene]] and "another Mary" who had arrived to [[anoint]] the body ({{niv|Matthew|28:1–10|Matthew 28:1–10}}). According to Luke there were two angels ({{niv|Luke|24:4|Luke 24:4}}), and according to Mark there was a youth dressed in white ({{niv|Mark|16:5|Mark 16:5}}). The "[[Mark 16|longer ending]]" to Mark states that on the morning of his resurrection, Jesus first appeared to Mary Magdalene ({{niv|Mark|16:9|Mark 16:9}}). John states that when Mary looked into the tomb, two angels asked her why she was crying; and as she turned round she initially failed to recognize Jesus until he spoke her name ({{niv|john|20:11–18|John 20:11–18}}).

The [[Acts of the Apostles]] state that Jesus appeared to various people in various places over the next forty days. Hours after his resurrection, he appeared to two travelers on the road to [[Emmaus]] ({{niv|Luke|24:13–35|Luke 24:13–35}}). To his assembled disciples he showed himself on the evening after his resurrection ({{niv|John|20:19|John 20:19}}). Although his own ministry had been specifically to Jews, Jesus is said to have sent his apostles to the Gentiles with the [[Great Commission]] and [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|ascended]] to heaven while a cloud concealed him from their sight. According to Acts, [[Paul of Tarsus]] had a vision of Jesus during his [[Road to Damascus]] experience. Jesus promised to [[Second Coming|come again]] to fulfill the remainder of [[Messianic prophecy]].<ref>''Ministering to Israel'': {{niv|Matthew|15:24|Matthew 15:24}}; ''ascension'': {{niv|Mark|16:19|Mark 16:19}}; {{niv|Luke|24:51|Luke 24:51}}{{niv|Acts|1:6–11|Acts 1:6–11.}}; ''Paul's conversion on the road to Damascus'': {{niv|Acts|9:1–19|Acts 9:1–19.}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|22:1–22|31}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|26:9–24|31}}; ''Second coming'': {{niv|Matthew|24:36–44|Matthew 24:36–44}}</ref>

=== Fulfillment of prophecy ===
{{main|Messianic prophecy in Christianity}}

The Gospels present Jesus' birth, life, death, and resurrection as fulfillments of prophecies found in the Hebrew Bible. See, for example, the [[virgin birth]], the [[flight into Egypt]], Immanuel ([[Isaiah 7:14]]), and the [[suffering servant]].<ref name="Christianity.com">{{cite web|url=http://christianity.com/Christian%20Foundations/Jesus/11541169/|title="What the Old Testament Prophesied About the Messiah"|accessdate=2007-10-11}}</ref>

== Historical Jesus ==
{{main|Historical Jesus|Quest for the historical Jesus}}

Scholars have used the [[historical method]] to develop probable reconstructions of Jesus' life. Over the past two hundred years, the image of Jesus among historical scholars has come to be very different than the common image of Jesus that was based on the gospels.<ref>[[Marcus Borg|Borg, Marcus J.]] in Borg, Marcus J. and N. T. Wright. The Meaning of Jesus: Two visions. New York: HarperCollins. 2007.</ref> Some scholars draw a distinction between Jesus as reconstructed through historical methods and Jesus as understood through a theological point of view, while other scholars hold that a [[Religious perspectives on Jesus|theological Jesus]] represents a historical figure.<ref>See, for an example of the latter, Pope [[Benedict XVI]], ''Jesus of Nazareth''. Doubleday, 2007. ISBN 978-0-385-52341-7</ref> The main sources of information regarding Jesus' life and teachings are the gospels, especially the synoptic gospels: [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]]. Biblical scholars and most historians accept the historical existence of Jesus and regard claims against his existence as "effectively refuted".<ref>"The nonhistoricity thesis has always been controversial, and it has consistently failed to convince scholars of many disciplines and religious creeds.&nbsp;... Biblical scholars and classical historians now regard it as effectively refuted." - [http://www.westernsem.edu/explore/faculty/vanvoorst Van Voorst, Robert E.] ''Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence'' (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 2000), p. 16.</ref>

=== The Quest of the Historical Jesus ===
The English title of Albert Schweitzer's 1906 book, "The Quest of the Historical Jesus," is a label for the post-Enlightenment effort to describe Jesus using critical historical methods.<ref name ="Oxford:Historical">Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005 - article "Historical Jesus, Quest of the"</ref> Since the end of the 18th century, scholars have examined the gospels and tried to formulate historical biographies of Jesus.

=== Constructing a historical Jesus ===

{{main|Historical Jesus|Cultural and historical background of Jesus}}

Historians analyze the gospels to try to discern the historical man on whom these stories are based. They compare what the gospels say to historical events relevant to the times and places where the gospels were written. They try to answer historical questions about Jesus, such as why he was crucified.

Most scholars agree the Gospel of Mark was written about the time of the destruction of [[Herod's Temple|the Jewish Temple]] by the Romans under [[Titus]] in the year 70, and that the other gospels were written between 70–100.<ref>Meier (1991), pp.43–4</ref> The historical outlook on Jesus relies on [[Biblical criticism|critical analysis of the Bible]], especially the gospels. Many scholars have sought to reconstruct Jesus' life in terms of contemporaneous political, cultural, and religious currents in Israel, including differences between Galilee and Judea, and between different sects such the [[Pharisees]], [[Sadducees]], [[Essenes]] and [[Zealots]],<ref>For a comparison of the Jesus movement to the Zealots, see [[S. G. F. Brandon]], ''Jesus and the Zealots: a study of the political factor in primitive Christianity,'' Manchester University Press (1967) ISBN 0–684–31010–4</ref><ref name="comparison">For a general comparison of Jesus' teachings to other schools of first century Judaism, see [[John P. Meier]], ''Companions and Competitors (A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus, Volume 3)'' Anchor Bible, 2001. ISBN 0–385–46993–4.</ref> and in terms of conflicts among Jews in the context of Roman occupation.

Peter Kirby's ''[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/theories.html Historical Jesus Theories]'' gives an overview of the conflicting answers that recent writers have given to these questions. The variety and contradictory character of these answers indicate that what follows here is not to be taken as representing a consensus among scholars.

===Descriptions of historical Jesus===
Historians generally describe Jesus as an healer who preached the restoration of God's kingdom.<ref>[[Shaye J.D. Cohen]], ''From the Maccabees to the Mishnah'', Westminster Press, 1987, p. 78, 93, 105, 108; [[John Dominic Crossan]], ''The Historical Jesus: The Life of a Mediterranean Jewish Peasant'', HarperCollins, 1991, p. xi – xiii; Michael Grant, p. 34–35, 78, 166, 200; [[Paula Fredriksen]], ''Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews'', Alfred B. Knopf, 1999, p. 6–7, 105–110, 232–234, 266; John P. Meier, vol. 1:68, 146, 199, 278, 386, 2:726; E.P. Sanders, pp. 12–13; [[Geza Vermes]], Jesus the Jew (Philadelphia: Fortress Press 1973), p. 37.; </ref> Most historians agree he was baptized by John the Baptist, and was crucified by the Romans. 

====Baptism====
John the Baptist led a large apocalyptic movement. He demanded repentance and baptism. Jesus was baptized and later began his ministry. After John was executed, some of his followers apparently took Jesus as their new leader.<ref>Sanders, E.P. ''Jesus and Judaism.'' Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1987; [[Geza Vermes|Vermes, Geza]]. ''Jesus the Jew: A Historian's Reading of the Gospels.'' Minneapolis: Augsburg Fortress, 1981; [[Paula Fredriksen|Fredriksen, Paula]]. ''From Jesus to Christ.'' New Haven: Yale University Press, 2000.</ref>

Historians are nearly unanimous in accepting Jesus' baptism as a historical event.<ref>Sanders, E.P. ''Jesus and Judaism.'' Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1987; [[Geza Vermes|Vermes, Geza]]. ''Jesus the Jew: A Historian's Reading of the Gospels.'' Minneapolis: Augsburg Fortress, 1981; [[Paula Fredriksen|Fredriksen, Paula]]. ''From Jesus to Christ.'' New Haven: Yale University Press, 2000.</ref>

====Teaching====
According to Robert Funk, Jesus taught in pithy parables and with striking images.<ref name = "5G">[[Robert W. Funk|Funk, Robert W.]], Roy W. Hoover, and the Jesus Seminar. ''The five gospels.'' HarperSanFrancisco. 1993.</ref> He likened the Kingdom of Heaven to small and lowly things, such as yeast or a mustard seed,<ref name = "5G">[[Robert W. Funk|Funk, Robert W.]], Roy W. Hoover, and the Jesus Seminar. ''The five gospels.'' HarperSanFrancisco. 1993. page 21.</ref> that have great effects. Historians often see Jesus' theological pronouncements in the gospels as coming from the Christian tradition but not from Jesus' himself.

Jesus placed a special emphasis on God as one's heavenly father.<ref name = "5G">[[Robert W. Funk|Funk, Robert W.]], Roy W. Hoover, and the Jesus Seminar. ''The five gospels.'' HarperSanFrancisco. 1993. page 21.</ref>

==== Names and titles ====
{{Jesus}}
{{main|Names and titles of Jesus in the New Testament}}

The name '''Jesus''' is an anglicization of the Hebrew name that would have more closely been pronounced as spelled ''Yeshua''.{{Fact|date=March 2008}}

Jesus probably lived in [[Galilee]] for most of his life and he probably spoke [[Aramaic]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.godward.org/Hebrew%20Roots/did%20jesus%20speak%20hebrew.htm|title=Brian Knowles: Which Language Did Jesus Speak – Aramaic or Hebrew?}}</ref> The name "Jesus" is an [[English language|English]] transliteration of the [[Latin language|Latin]] (''Iēsus'') which in turn comes from the [[Koine Greek|Greek]] name Iesous (''{{Polytonic|Ιησους}}''). The name has also been translated into English as "[[Joshua]]".<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374x.htm "Origin of the Name of Jesus Christ"]. ''Catholic Encyclopedia''. Retrieved [[April 14]], [[2007]].''</ref> Further examination of the [[Septuagint]] finds that the Greek, in turn, is a transliteration of the Hebrew/[[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] [[Yeshua (name)|Yeshua]] ({{lang|he|ישוע}}) (''Yeshua'' — he will save) a contraction of Hebrew name ''Yehoshua'' ({{lang|he|יהושוע}} ''Yeho'' — [[Yahweh]] [is] ''shua`'' — deliverance/rescue, usually Romanized as ''Joshua''). Scholars believe that one of these was likely the name that Jesus was known by during his lifetime by his peers.<ref>Durant, Will. ''Caesar and Christ''. New York: Simon and Schuster, 1944. p. 558; John P. Meier, ''A Marginal Jew''. New York: Doubleday, 1991 vol. 1:205–7;</ref>

''[[Christ]]'' (which is a title and not a part of his name) is an Anglicization of the Greek term for ''[[Messiah]]'' (''χριστός'', from the verb ''χρίω'' "to anoint"), and literally means "anointed one." Historians have debated what this title might have meant at the time Jesus lived; some historians have suggested that other titles applied to Jesus in the New Testament had meanings in the first century quite different from those meanings ascribed today.<ref>Vermes, "Jesus the Jew: A Historian's Reading of the Gospels"</ref>

The titles "Divine", "[[Son of God]]", "God", "God from God", "Lord", "Redeemer", "Liberator", and "Saviour of the World" were each applied to the Roman emperors. [[John Dominic Crossan]] considers that the application of them to Jesus by the early Christians would have been regarded as denying them to the emperor(s). "They were taking the identity of the Roman emperor and giving it to a Jewish peasant. Either that was a peculiar joke and a very low lampoon, or it was what the Romans called ''majestas'' and we call high treason."<ref> Crossan, John Dominic, God and Empire, 2007, p. 28</ref>

The title [[Son of God]] has often been taken as a claim to divinity. Likewise, Jesus claimed the title "I AM" in {{niv|John|8:58|John 8:58}} which designates God in the Hebrew Bible, especially in {{niv|Exodus|3:14|Exodus 3:14}}.<ref>"Jesus was claiming for himself the title "I AM" by which God designates himself... he was claiming to be God." - Wayne Grudem, ''Systematic Theology'', page 546, Zondervan.</ref> Some New Testament scholars, however, argue that Jesus himself made no claims to being God.<ref>"A further point of broad agreement among New Testament scholars is&nbsp;... that the historical Jesus did not make the claim to deity that later Christian thought was to make for him: he did not understand himself to be God, or God the Son, incarnate. " - [[John Hick]], ''The Metaphor of God Incarnate: Christology in a Pluralistic Age'', Westminster John Knox Press, page 27.</ref><ref>[[Michael Ramsey]], ''Jesus and the Living Past'' (Oxford University Press, 1980), page 39: 'Jesus did not claim deity for himself’</ref><ref>[[C. F. D. Moule]], ''The Origin of Christology'' : 'Any case for a "high" Christology that depended on the authenticity of the alleged claims of Jesus about himself, especially in the Fourth Gospel, would indeed be precarious'</ref><ref>[[James Dunn|James Dunn (theologian)]], ''Christology in the Making'', (SCM Press 1980), page 254: 'We cannot claim that Jesus believed himself to be the incarnate Son of God' and 'There is no question in my mind that the doctrine of incarnation comes to clear expression within the NT…John 1.14 ranks as a classic formulation of the Christian belief in Jesus as incarnate God.' Page xiii. . </ref><ref>Brian Hebblethwaite, ''The Incarnation'' (Cambridge University Press, 1987), page 74: 'it is no longer possible to defend the divinity of Jesus by reference to the claims of Jesus' . </ref><ref>John A. T. Robinson, ''Honest to God'', Westminster Press (1963), Page 47: 'It is, indeed, an open question whether Jesus ever claimed to be the Son of God, let alone God.'</ref><ref>Larry Hurtado, ''Lord Jesus Christ: Devotion to Jesus in Earliest Christianity'', page 5, describes the view that Jesus made 'both his messiahship and his divinity clear to his disciples during his ministry' as 'naive and ahistorical'.</ref> Most Christians identified Jesus as divine from a very early period, although holding a variety of views as to what exactly this implied.<ref>Larry Hurtado, ''Lord Jesus Christ: Devotion to Jesus in Earliest Christianity'', (Eerdmans, 2005), page 650.</ref>

=== Religious groups ===
Scholars refer to the religious background of the early 1st-century to better reconstruct Jesus' life. Some scholars identify him with one or another group.

====Pharisees====
Pharisees were a powerful force in 1st-century Judaism. After the fall of the Temple, the Pharisee outlook was established in Rabbinic Judaism.

Some scholars speculate that Jesus was himself a [[Pharisee]].<ref>Based on a comparison of the Gospels with the [[Talmud]] and other Jewish literature. <!-- Sanders is disputed, see talk[[E. P. Sanders|Sanders, E. P.]] ''Jesus and Judaism,'' Fortress Press, 1987. ISBN 0–8006–2061–5; --> [[Hyam Maccoby|Maccoby, Hyam]] ''Jesus the Pharisee,'' Scm Press, 2003. ISBN 0–334–02914–7; [[Harvey Falk|Falk, Harvey]] ''Jesus the Pharisee: A New Look at the Jewishness of Jesus,'' Wipf & Stock Publishers (2003). ISBN 1–59244–313–3.</ref> In Jesus' day, the two main schools of thought among the Pharisees were the [[House of Hillel]], which had been founded by the eminent [[Tannaim|Tanna]], [[Hillel the Elder]], and the [[House of Shammai]]. Jesus' assertion of hypocrisy may have been directed against the stricter members of the House of Shammai, although he also agreed with their teachings on divorce ({{niv|Mark|10:1–12|Mark 10:1–12}}).<ref>[[Jacob Neusner|Neusner, Jacob]] ''A Rabbi Talks With Jesus,'' McGill-Queen's University Press, 2000. ISBN 0–7735–2046–5. Rabbi Neusner contends that Jesus' teachings were closer to the House of Shammai than the House of Hillel.</ref> Jesus also commented on the House of Hillel's teachings ([[Babylonian Talmud]], [[Shabbat]] 31a) concerning the [[Shema Yisrael|greatest commandment]] ({{niv|Mark|12:28–34|Mark 12:28–34}}) and the [[Ethic of reciprocity|Golden Rule]] ({{niv|Matthew|7:12|Matthew 7:12}}).

====Sadducees====
The Sadducee sect was particularly powerful in Jerusalem. They accepted the written Law only, rejecting the traditional interpretations accepted by the Pharisees, such as belief in retribution in an afterlife, resurrection of the body, angels, and spirits. They appear to have opposed Jesus' ministry, perhaps because they feared trouble from the Roman power, and in any case because they opposed his doctrines. After the fall of Jerusalem, they disappeared from history.<ref name = "Cross-2005">"Sadducees." Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005</ref>

====Essenes====
Essenes were apocalyptic ascetics, one of the three (or four) major Jewish schools of the time, though they were not mentioned in the [[New Testament]].<ref>Based on a comparison of the Gospels with the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], especially the [[Teacher of Righteousness]] and Pierced Messiah. [[Robert Eisenman|Eisenman, Robert]] ''James the Brother of Jesus: The Key to Unlocking the Secrets of Early Christianity and the Dead Sea Scrolls,'' Penguin (Non-Classics), 1998. ISBN 0–14–025773-X; [[Hartmut Stegemann|Stegemann, Hartmut]] ''The Library of Qumran: On the Essenes, Qumran, John the Baptist, and Jesus.'' Grand Rapids MI, 1998. See also Broshi, Magen, "What Jesus Learned from the Essenes," ''[[Biblical Archaeology Review]],'' 30:1, pg. 32–37, 64. Magen notes similarities between Jesus' teachings on the virtue of poverty and divorce, and Essene teachings as related in Josephus' ''[[The Jewish Wars]]'' and in the [[Damascus Document]] of the Dead Sea Scrolls, respectively. See also [[Keith Akers| Akers, Keith]] ''The Lost Religion of Jesus.'' Lantern, 2000. ISBN 1-930051-26-3.</ref>

Some scholars theorize that Jesus was an [[Essene]], or close to them.  Among these scholars is Pope Benedict XVI, who supposes in his book on Jesus that "it appears that not only John the Baptist, but possibly Jesus and his family as well, were close to the Qumran community."<ref> Joseph Ratzinger, Pope Benedict XVI, Jesus of Nazareth, p. 14</ref>

====Apocalyptic movements====
Still other scholars hypothesize that Jesus led a new [[Apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] sect, possibly related to [[John the Baptist]],<ref>See [[Albert Schweitzer|Schwietzer, Albert]] ''The Quest of the Historical Jesus: A Critical Study of its Progress from Reimarus to Wrede,'' pp. 370–371, 402. Scribner (1968), ISBN 0–02–089240–3; [[Bart Ehrman|Ehrman, Bart]] ''Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium,'' Oxford University Press USA, 1999. ISBN 0–19–512474-X. Crossan, however, makes a distinction between John's apocalyptic ministry and Jesus' ethical ministry. See [[John Dominic Crossan|Crossan, John Dominic]], ''The Birth of Christianity: Discovering What Happened in the Years Immediately After the Execution of Jesus,'' pp. 305–344. Harper Collins, 1998. ISBN 0–06–061659–8.</ref> who became [[Early Christianity|early Christian]] after the [[Great Commission]] spread his teachings to the [[Gentiles]].<ref>This includes the belief that Jesus was the Messiah. [[Michael L. Brown|Brown, Michael L.]] ''Answering Jewish Objections to Jesus: Messianic Prophecy Objections'' Baker Books, 2003. ISBN 0–8010–6423–6. Brown shows how the Christian concept of Messiah relates to ideas current in late Second Temple period Judaism. See also [[Joseph Klausner|Klausner, Joseph]], ''The Messianic Idea in Israel: From its Beginning to the Completion of the Mishnah,'' Macmillan 1955; [[Raphael Patai|Patai, Raphael]], ''Messiah Texts,'' Wayne State University Press, 1989. ISBN 0–8143–1850–9; [[John Dominic Crossan|Crossan, John Dominic]], ''The Birth of Christianity: Discovering What Happened in the Years Immediately After the Execution of Jesus,'' pg. 461. Harper Collins, 1998. ISBN 0–06–061659–8. Patai and Klausner state that one interpretation of the prophecies reveal either two Messiahs, Messiah ben Yosef (the dying Messiah) and Messiah ben David (the Davidic King), or one Messiah who comes twice. Crossan cites the Essene teachings about the twin Messiahs. Compare to the Christian doctrine of the [[Second Coming]].</ref> This is distinct from an earlier commission Jesus gave to the [[twelve Apostles]], limited to "the lost sheep of the house of Israel" and specifically excluding the Gentiles or [[Samaritans]] ({{niv|Matthew|10|Matthew 10}}).

====Nazarenes====
The Gospels record that Jesus was a [[Nazarene]], a term commonly taken to refer to his place of birth, but sometimes as a religious affiliation.<ref name="comparison">.</ref> 

====Zealots====
The Zealots were a revolutionary party opposed to Roman rule, one of those parties that, according to [[Josephus]] inspired the fanatical stand in Jerusalem that led to its destruction in the year 70.<ref name = "Cross-2005-Zealots">"Zealots." Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005</ref> Luke identifies Simon, a disciple, as a "zealot," which might mean a member of the Zealot party (which would therefore have been already in existence in the lifetime of Jesus) or a zealous person.<ref name = "Cross-2005-Zealots"/> The notion that Jesus himself was a Zealot does not do justice to the earliest Synoptic material describing him.<ref>"Jesus Christ." Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005</ref>

=== Gospels as historical texts ===
{{main|Higher criticism}} 

The New Testament, especially the synoptic gospels, were written soon after Jesus' life, making them relevant to historical analysis.<ref>"The New Testament was complete, of substantially complete, about AD 100, the majority of the writings being in existence twenty to forty years before this ...the situation is encouraging from the historian's point of view, for the first three Gospels were written at a time when many were alive who could remember the things that Jesus said and did... At any rate, the time elapsing between the evangelic events and the writing of most of the New Testament books was, from the standpoint of historical research, satisfactorily short." Bruce, F. F.: ''The New Testament Documents: Are They Reliable?'', pp. 12-14, InterVarsity Press, USA, 1997.</ref><!--(paul barnett is not signficant enough to warrant direct quotation) [[Paul Barnett (bishop)|Paul Barnett]] pointed out that "scholars of ancient history have always recognized the '[[subjectivity]]' factor in their available sources" and "have so few sources available compared to their modern counterparts that they will gladly seize whatever scraps of information that are at hand." He noted that [[modern history]] and ancient history are two separate disciplines, with differing methods of analysis and interpretation.<ref>[[Paul Barnett (bishop)|Barnett, Paul]], "Is the New Testament History?," p.1.</ref> --> Modern scholars use various methods for sorting out the historical Jesus who inspired the gospels from the Jesus of faith that the gospel authors wrote about.

After the original oral stories were written down in Greek, they were transcribed, and later translated into other languages. This is not unique to the [[Bible]] — other documents of antiquity have been scrutinized for gaps between the date of an event and the date it was written. Having been written, the New Testament sources encountered insignificant changes, according to scholars such as the late [[Frederic Kenyon|Sir Frederic Kenyon]] (1863 - 1952).<ref>"The interval then between the dates of the original composition and the earliest extant evidence becomes so small as to be in fact negligible, and the last foundation for any doubt that the Sciptures have come down to us substantially as they were written has now been removed. Both the ''authenticity'' and the ''general integrity'' of the books of the New Testament may be regarded as finally established." As quoted in Bruce, F. F.: ''The New Testament Documents: Are They Reliable?'', p. 20, InterVarsity Press, USA, 1997.</ref>

Contemporary textual critic [[Bart D. Ehrman]] cites numerous places where the gospels, and other New Testament books, were apparently altered by Christian scribes.<ref name = "Misquoting">Ehrman, Bart (2005). [[Misquoting Jesus]]: The Story Behind Who Changed the Bible and Why. HarperSanFrancisco. ISBN 0-06-073817-0.</ref> The scribes, largely amateurs, worked to make the gospels more similar and to remove verses that could be taken to support unorthodox beliefs common in early Christianity.<ref name = "Misquoting"/> For example, Luke portrays Jesus as implacable in the face of his crucifixion, contrary to Mark, which portrays him in agony. Ehrman considers that verses in Luke in which Jesus sweats blood to be a later interpolation, made to include agony in Luke's account.<ref name = "Misquoting"/>
<!--(only reference in this paragraph is a non-scholarly web site, and the content is thin) The [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the [[Scientific Revolution]] brought skepticism regarding the historical accuracy of these texts. Although some critical scholars, including archaeologists, continue to use them as points of reference in the study of ancient Near Eastern history,<ref>Hawkins, Craig S. [http://www.apologeticsinfo.org/papers/actsarcheology.html "The Book of Acts and Archaeology"], Apologetics Information Ministry, Retrieved [[April 14]], [[2007]].</ref> others have come to view the texts as cultural and literary documents, generally regarding them as part of the genre of literature called [[hagiography]], an account of a holy person regarded as representing a moral and divine ideal. Hagiography has as its primary aim the glorification of the religion itself and of the example set by the perfect holy person represented as its central focus.-->
The views of intellectuals who entirely reject Jesus' historicity are summarized in the chapter on Jesus in [[Will Durant]]'s ''Caesar and Christ''. It is based on a scarcity of eyewitness accounts, a lack of direct archaeological evidence, the failure of specific ancient works to mention Jesus, and similarities between early Christianity and contemporary mythology.<ref>Durant 1944:553–7</ref>

One method used to estimate the factual accuracy of stories in the gospels is known as the "[[criterion of embarrassment]]," which holds that stories about events with embarrassing aspects (such as the denial of Jesus by [[Saint Peter|Peter]], or the fleeing of Jesus' followers after his arrest) would likely not have been included if those accounts were fictional.<ref name="A Marginal Jew"> Meier, John P., [[John P. Meier#A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus|''A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus'']], Doubleday: 1991. vol 1: p. 168–171. </ref> Biblical scholars hold that the works describing Jesus were initially communicated by [[oral history|oral tradition]], and were not committed to writing until several decades after Jesus' crucifixion. The earliest [[extant text]]s which refer to Jesus are [[Paul the Apostle|Paul's]] letters, which are usually dated from the mid-1st century. Paul wrote that he only saw Jesus in visions, but that they were divine [[revelation]]s and hence authoritative ({{niv|Galatians|1:11–12|Galatians 1:11–12}}). The earliest extant texts describing Jesus in any detail were the four [[Gospel]]s.
<!-- (not about Jesus) 
Many other early Christian texts detail events in Jesus' life and teachings, though they were not included when [[Biblical canon|the Bible was canonized]] due to a belief that they were [[pseudepigraphy|pseudepigraphical]], not inspired, or written too long after his death, while others were suppressed because they contradicted Christian [[orthodoxy]]. It took several centuries before the list of what was and was not part of the [[Bible]] became finally fixed, and for much of the early period the [[Book of Revelation]] was not included while works like [[The Shepherd of Hermas]] were.

Books that were not included are known as the [[New Testament apocrypha]]. These include the ''[[Gospel of Thomas]]'', a collection of ''[[logia]]'' — phrases and sayings attributed to Jesus without a narrative framework, only rediscovered in the 20th century. Other important apocryphal works that had a heavy influence in forming traditional Christian beliefs include the [[Apocalypse of Peter]], [[Protevangelium of James]], [[Infancy Gospel of Thomas]], and [[Acts of Peter]]. A number of Christian traditions (such as [[Saint Veronica|Veronica's veil]] and the [[Assumption of Mary]]) are found not in the canonical gospels but in these and other apocryphal works.

==== Possible earlier texts ====
Some texts with even earlier historical or mythological information on Jesus are speculated to have existed prior to the Gospels,<ref>Bettenson, Henry and Maunder, Chris. ''Documents of the Christian Church'' (3rd edition), Oxford University Press, 1999. ISBN 0–19–288071–3 </ref> though none have been found other than the Pauline epistles. Based on the [[synoptic problem|unusual similarities and differences]] between the [[Synoptic Gospels]] — [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], the first three canonical gospels — many Biblical scholars have suggested that [[oral tradition]] and [[logia]] (such as the [[Gospel of Thomas]] and the theoretical [[Q document]])<ref>Gaztambide, Daniel. [http://www.aramaicnt.org/site/index.php?mode=article&entry=30 "The Synoptic Problem: Two-Source Hypothesis and Q"], AramaicNT.org, Retrieved [[April 14]], [[2007]].</ref> probably played a strong role in initially passing down stories of Jesus, and may have inspired some of the Synoptic Gospels.

Specifically, many scholars believe that the Q document and the Gospel of Mark were the [[two-source hypothesis|two sources]] used for the gospels of Matthew and Luke; however, other theories, such as the older [[Augustinian hypothesis]], continue to hold sway with some Biblical scholars. Another theoretical document is the [[Signs Gospel]], believed to have been a source for the [[Gospel of John]].<ref>Gaztambide, Daniel. [http://www.aramaicnt.org/site/index.php?mode=article&entry=28 "So Sayeth The Lord... According to Who?"], AramaicNT.org, Retrieved [[April 14]], [[2007]].</ref>

There are also early non-canonical gospels which may predate the canonical Gospels, although few surviving fragments have been found. Among these are the [[Unknown Berlin Gospel]], the [[Oxyrhynchus Gospels]], the [[Egerton Gospel]], the [[Fayyum Fragment]], the [[Dialogue of the Saviour]], the [[Gospel of the Ebionites]], the [[Gospel of the Hebrews]], and the [[Gospel of the Nazarenes]].<ref>Miller, Robert J. ''ed.'' (1994) ''The Complete Gospels: Annotated Scholars Version''. Polebridge Pres: Sonoma, CA. pp. 1–5.</ref> -->

===Jesus as myth===
{{Main|Jesus myth hypothesis}}
{{see|Jesus Christ and comparative mythology}}

A few scholars have questioned the existence of Jesus as an actual historical figure. Among the proponents of non-historicity have been [[Bruno Bauer]] in the 19th century. Non-historicity was somewhat influential in biblical studies during the early 20th century.
(The views of scholars who entirely rejected Jesus' historicity then were summarized in the chapter on Jesus in [[Will Durant]]'s ''Caesar and Christ'' (in 1944); they were based on a suggested lack of eyewitness, a lack of direct archaeological evidence, the failure of certain ancient works to mention Jesus, and similarities early Christianity shares with then-contemporary religion and mythology.<ref>Durant 1944:553-7</ref>)

[[Michael Grant (author)|Michael Grant]] stated (in 1977) that the view is derived from a lack of application of historical methods:
<blockquote>…if we apply to the New Testament, as we should, the same sort of criteria as we should apply to other ancient writings containing historical material, we can no more reject Jesus' existence than we can reject the existence of a mass of pagan personages whose reality as historical figures is never questioned.&nbsp;... To sum up, modern critical methods fail to support the Christ myth theory. It has 'again and again been answered and annihilated by first rank scholars.' In recent years, 'no serious scholar has ventured to postulate the non historicity of Jesus' or at any rate very few, and they have not succeeded in disposing of the much stronger, indeed very abundant, evidence to the contrary.<ref>M. Grant, ''Jesus: An Historian's Review'', pp. 199-200</ref></blockquote>

More recently, arguments for non-historicity have been discussed by scholars such as [[George Albert Wells]] and [[Robert M. Price]]. Additionally, [[The Jesus Puzzle]] and [[The Jesus Mysteries]] are examples of popular works promoting the non-history hypothesis. Nevertheless, non-historicity is still regarded as effectively refuted by almost all Biblical scholars and historians.<ref>Bruce, FF (1982). ''New Testament Documents: Are They Reliable?''

{{main|Christian views of Jesus|Christology}}

Though [[Christianity|Christian]] views of Jesus vary, it is possible to describe a general majority Christian view by examining the similarities between specific Western Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and many Protestant doctrines found in their [[catechism|catechetical]] or [[Confessionalism (religion)|confessional]] texts.<ref>This section draws on a number of sources to determine the doctrines of these groups, especially the early Creeds, the Catechism of the Catholic Church, certain theological works, and various Confessions drafted during the Reformation including the Thirty Nine Articles of the Church of England, works contained in the Book of Concord, and others.</ref> This view, given below as the Principal view, does not encompass all groups which describe themselves as Christian, with other views immediately following.

Christians profess that Jesus is the Messiah (Greek: ''Christos''; English: Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament,<ref>''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' §436–40; ''Thirty Nine Articles of the Church of England'', article 2; Irenaeus ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus Haereses]]'' in ''[[Patrologia Graeca]]'' ed.

The [[Atonement (satisfaction view)|satisfaction view]] of [[atonement]] for sin, first articulated by [[Anselm of Canterbury]], is that humanity owes God a debt of honor. This debt creates essentially an imbalance in the moral universe; it could not be satisfied by God's simply ignoring it. In this view, the only possible way of repaying the debt was for a being of infinite greatness, acting as a man on behalf of men, to repay the debt of honor owed to God. Therefore, when Jesus died, he paid a debt to God, his father. [[Thomas Aquinas]] consider atonement and articulated that rather than seeing the debt as one of honor, he sees the debt as a moral injustice to be righted. Aquinas concludes that punishment is a morally good response to sin, "Christ bore a satisfactory punishment, not for His, but for our sins," and substitution for another's sin is entirely possible.{{Fact|date=March 2008}}

Christians also profess that Jesus suffered death by [[crucifixion]],<ref>[[Apostles' Creed]]; [[Nicene Creed]];[[Luther's Small Catechism]] commentary on [[Apostles' Creed]]; ''Second Helvetic Confession'', chapter 9</ref> and rose bodily from the dead in the definitive miracle that foreshadows the [[Resurrection of the dead|resurrection]] of humanity at the end of time,<ref>''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' §638–655; Byzantine Liturgy, ''Troparion'' of Easter; ''Thirty Nine Articles of the Church of England'', article 4 and 17; ''Augsburg Confession'', article 3; ''Second Helvetic Confession'', chapter 9.</ref> when Christ will come again to [[Last judgment|judge the living and the dead]],<ref>[[Apostles' Creed]]; [[Nicene Creed]]; [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] §668–675, 678–679; [[Luther's Small Catechism]] commentary on [[Apostles' Creed]]; {{niv|Matthew|25:32–46|Mt 25:32–46}}</ref> resulting in either entrance into heaven or damnation.<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2L.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church §1021-1022]</ref> The [[Death and resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] is perhaps the most controversial aspect of the life of Jesus. Christianity hinges on this point of Christology, both as a response to a particular history and as a confessional response.<ref>[[Reginald H. Fuller#The Foundations of New Testament Christology (1965)|Fuller 1965, p. 15]]</ref> Christians believe that Jesus’ resurrection brings reconciliation with God (II Corinthians 5:18), the destruction of death (I Corinthians 15:26), and forgiveness of sins for followers of Jesus.{{Fact|date=March 2008}} 

[[Image:Christology.gif|left|thumb|350px|Comparison of Christological positions]]

In the beginning of the second century, the Roman official and writer, [[Pliny the Younger]] (63 - ca. 113), stated that Christians were "singing responsively a hymn to Christ as to god" (''carmenque Christo quasi deo dicere secum invicem'').<ref>Pliny the Younger: [http://www.vroma.org/~hwalker/Pliny/Pliny10-096-L.html C. Plinius Traino Imperatori Liber Decimus Epistula XCVI]</ref> Between 325 and 681, Christians theologically articulated and refined their view of the nature of Jesus by a series of seven [[ecumenical council]]s (see [[Christology]]). These councils described Jesus as one of the three divine [[Hypostasis (religion)|hypostases]] or persons of the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]]: the Son is defined as constituting, together with God the Father and the Holy Spirit, the single [[Ousia|substance]] of the One God (see ''[[Communicatio idiomatum]]'').<ref>''Nicene Creed''; ''Thirty Nine Articles of the Church of England'', article 1; ''Augsburg Confession'', article 1; ''Second Helvetic Confession'', chapter 3; Council of Nicaea I (325) in Denzinger-Schönmetzer, ''{{lang|la|Enchiridion Symbolorum, definitionum et declarationum de rebus fidei et morum}}'' (1965) §126; Council of Constantinople II (553) in ibid. §424 and 424; Council of Ephesus in ibid. §255; {{niv|John|1:1|John 1:1}}; {{niv|John|8:58|8:58}}; {{niv|John|10:30|10:30}}</ref> Furthermore, Jesus is defined to be one person with a fully human and a fully divine [[Physis|nature]], a doctrine known as the [[Hypostatic union]].<ref>''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' §464–469; ''Thirty Nine Articles of the Church of England'', article 2 and 3 ''Second Helvetic Confession'', chapter 9; Council of Ephesus (431) in Denzinger-Schönmetzer, ''{{lang|la|Enchiridion Symbolorum, definitionum et declarationum de rebus fidei et morum}}'' (1965) §250; Council of Ephesus in ibid. §251; Council of Chalcedon (451) in ibid. §301 and 302; {{niv|Hebrews|4:15|Hebrews 4:15}}.</ref> However, the [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] and the [[Church of the East & Abroad]] do not accept the hypostatic union.{{Fact|date=March 2008}}

The Gospels of Matthew and Luke suggest the [[Virgin Birth of Jesus|virgin birth]] of Jesus. Barth speaks of the virgin birth as the divine sign “which accompanies and indicates the mystery of the incarnation of the Son.”<ref>Barth 1956, p. 207</ref> Donald MacLeod<ref>MacLeod 1998, p. 37-41</ref> gives several Christological implications of a virgin birth: it highlights salvation as a [[supernatural]] act of God rather than an act of human initiative, avoids [[adoptionism]] (which is virtually required if a normal birth), and reinforces the sinlessness of Christ, especially as it relates to Christ being outside the sin of Adam ([[original sin]]).

Jesus Christ, the Mediator of humankind, fulfills the [[Threefold Office|three offices of Prophet, Priest, and King]].  [[Eusebius]] of the early church worked out this threefold classification, which [[John Calvin]] developed<ref>John Calvin, Calvins Calvinism BOOK II Chapter 15 Centers for Reformed Theology and Apologetics [resource online] (1996-2002, accessed 03 June 2006); available [http://www.reformed.org/books/institutes/books/book2/bk2ch15.html#one.htm here]</ref> and [[John Wesley]] discussed.<ref>H.

They believe Jesus (not the Father) is the same as [[Jehovah]] or [[Yahweh]] of the [[Old Testament]]. ''See [[Religious perspectives on Jesus#Jesus in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Jesus in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].''

===== Jehovah's Witnesses =====
[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] believe Jesus to be God's (or Jehovah's) son, rather than being God himself. Jehovah's Witnesses believe he was the same divine created being as [[Archangel Michael|Michael the Archangel]],<ref> “Revelation—Its Grand Climax at Hand!” –1988 | chap. 27 pp. 180-181 par. 15 “God’s Kingdom Is Born!” | . © Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania | “But who is Michael? The name “Michael” means “Who Is Like God?” So Michael must be interested in vindicating Jehovah’s sovereignty by proving that no one is to be compared to Him. In Jude verse 9, he is called “Michael the archangel.” Interestingly, the title “archangel” is used elsewhere in the Bible with reference to only one person: Jesus Christ. Paul says of him: “The Lord himself will descend from heaven with a commanding call, with an archangel’s voice”</ref><ref> “Insight On The Scriptures 2” –1988 | p. 393 “Michael” | . © Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania | “Scriptural evidence indicates that the name Michael applied to God’s Son before he left heaven to become Jesus Christ and also after his return. Michael is the only one said to be “the archangel,” meaning “chief angel,” or “principal angel.” The term occurs in the Bible only in the singular. This seems to imply that there is but one whom God has designated chief, or head, of the angelic host. At 1 Thessalonians 4:16 the voice of the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ is described as being that of an archangel, suggesting that he is, in fact, himself the archangel” </ref> and that God made him a perfect human by transferring his life to the womb of Mary.<ref>"Jesus The Ruler Whose Origin Is From Early Times," ''The Watchtower'' (15 June 1998) p. 22. | "Some centuries later came Jesus’ greatest assignment up to that time. Jehovah transferred the life force of his beloved Son from heaven into the womb of Mary. Nine months later she gave birth to a baby boy, Jesus.

It was essential that he should in this way become completely like his brothers.” (But would he have been “completely like his brothers” if he had been a God-man?)”</ref> They also believe that he is "the word" of John 1:1. This is understood to mean that he is God's spokesman, likely the one speaking in God's name to Adam, and to the Israelites in the wilderness.<ref> “Insight On The Scriptures” –1988 | p. 53 “Jesus Christ” | . © Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania | “Doubtless on many occasions during his prehuman existence as the Word, Jesus acted as Jehovah’s Spokesman to persons on earth. While certain texts refer to Jehovah as though directly speaking to humans, other texts make clear that he did so through an angelic representative. (Compare Ex 3:2-4 with Ac 7:30, 35; also Ge 16:7-11, 13; 22:1, 11, 12, 15-18.) Reasonably, in the majority of such cases God spoke through the Word. He likely did so in Eden, for on two of the three occasions where mention is made of God’s speaking there, the record specifically shows someone was with Him, undoubtedly his Son. (Ge 1:26-30; 2:16, 17; 3:8-19, 22) The angel who guided Israel through the wilderness and whose voice the Israelites were strictly to obey because ‘Jehovah’s name was within him,’ may therefore have been God’s Son, the Word.—Ex 23:20-23; compare Jos 5:13-15.” </ref> In line with this, they point out that the Bible presents him as the only way humans can approach God.

===== Unity =====
The [[Unity Church]] considers Jesus the master teacher and "way show-er," citing Jesus' frequent calls to emulate him rather than worship him, and the ability of others to be like him, such as in John 10:34 and John 14:12. Jesus is not worshiped as God, but regarded as someone who had achieved a complete connection with God the Father.

===== Christadelphians =====
[[Christadelphians]] believe that Jesus is literally God's son, hence the Biblical title ''son of God'',<ref>{{cite book | last = Flint | first = James | authorlink = | coauthors = Deb Flint | title = One God or a Trinity? | publisher = Printland Publishers | date = | location = Hyderabad | pages = p. 3 | url = http://www.christadelphia.org/pamphlet/p_onegod.htm#3 | doi = | id = | isbn = 81-87409-61-4 }}</ref> not ''God the Son''.

===== Other alternative views =====
Others believe that the one God, who revealed himself in the Old Testament as Jehovah, came to earth, taking on the human form of Jesus Christ. They believe Jesus is Jehovah, is the Holy Spirit, and is the one Person who is God. Examples of such churches today are [[Oneness Pentecostals]] and the [[New Church]].

==== Other early views ====
Various [[early Christian]] groups and theologians held differing views of Jesus.
The [[Ebionites]], an early [[Jewish Christian]] community, believed that Jesus was the last of the [[Prophet#Prophets in the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible)|prophets]] and the [[Messiah]]. They believed that Jesus was the natural-born son of Mary and Joseph, and thus they rejected the Virgin Birth. The Ebionites were [[Adoptionism|adoptionists]], believing that Jesus was not divine, but became the [[son of God]] at his baptism. They rejected the [[Epistles of Paul]], believing that Jesus kept the [[Mosaic Law]] perfectly and wanted his followers to do the same. However, they felt that Jesus' crucifixion was the ultimate sacrifice, and thus [[animal sacrifice]]s were no longer necessary. Therefore, some Ebionites were [[vegetarian]] and considered both Jesus and [[John the Baptist]] to have been vegetarians.<ref>Ehrman, Bart D. ''Lost Christianities'', Oxford, 2003, p. 102.</ref>

In [[Gnosticism]], Jesus is said to have brought the secret knowledge ([[gnosis]]) of the spiritual world necessary for salvation.<ref>McManners, John, ed., ''The Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity,'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1990, pp. 26–31.</ref> Their secret teachings were paths to gnosis, and not gnosis itself. <!-- The previous sentence is necessary to clarify that gnosis is a different concept than the teachings of Scientology. --> While some Gnostics were [[docetism|docetics]], other Gnostics believed that Jesus was a human who became possessed by the spirit of Christ during his baptism.<ref>Ehrman, Bart D. ''Lost Christianities'', Oxford, 2003, p. 124–125.</ref> Many Gnostics believed that Christ was an [[Aeons#In Gnosticism|Aeon]] sent by [[Monad (Gnosticism)|a higher deity]] than the evil [[Demiurge#Gnosticism|demiurge]] who created the material world. Some Gnostics believed that Christ had a [[Syzygy#Gnosticism|syzygy]] named [[Sophia (gnosticism)|Sophia]]. The Gnostics tended to [[Gnosticism and the New Testament|interpret the books that were included in the New Testament]] as [[allegory]], and some Gnostics interpreted Jesus himself as an allegory. The Gnostics also used a number of [[Gnostic texts|other texts]] that did not become part of the New Testament canon.

[[Marcionites]] were 2nd century [[Gentile]] followers of the Christian theologian [[Marcion of Sinope]]. They believed that Jesus rejected the [[Tanakh|Jewish Scriptures]], or at least the parts that were incompatible with his teachings.<ref>[[Henry Wace|Wace, Henry]], [http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/info/marcion-wace.html "Commentary on Marcion"], Retrieved [[April 16]], [[2007]]. </ref> Seeing a stark contrast between the vengeful God of the [[Old Testament]] and the loving God of Jesus, Marcionites, like some Gnostics, came to the conclusion that the Jewish God was the evil creator of the world and Jesus was the savior from the material world. They also believed Jesus was not human, but instead a completely divine spiritual being whose material body, and thus his crucifixion and death, were [[docetism|divine illusions]].<ref>Ehrman, Bart D. ''Lost Christianities'', Oxford, 2003, p. 103, p. 104–105, p.108</ref> Marcionism was declared a [[Heresy#Christianity|heresy]] by proto-orthodox Christianity.

[[Sabellius]] in the 3rd century taught that the Trinity represented not three persons but a single person in three "modes." Jerome reported that the [[Montanists]] of his day shared this view.

=== Islamic views ===
{{main|Jesus in Islam}}

[[Islam]] holds Jesus ({{lang-ar|عيسى}} '''''`Īsā''''') to have been a messenger of God who had been sent to guide the [[Children of Israel]] (''banī isrā'īl'') with a new scripture, the ''[[Injil|Injīl]]'' (gospel).<ref> [[The Oxford Dictionary of Islam]], p.158 </ref> According to the [[Qur'an]], believed by Muslims to be God's final revelation, Jesus was born to Mary (Arabic: Maryam) as the result of [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virginal conception]], a miraculous event which occurred by the decree of [[God]] (Arabic: [[Allah]]). To aid him in his quest, Jesus was given the ability to perform [[miracle]]s. These included speaking from the cradle, curing the blind and the [[leper]]s, as well as raising the dead; all by the permission of God. Furthermore, Jesus was helped by a band of disciples (the ''ḥawāriyūn''). Islam states that Jesus was not killed nor [[Crucifixion|crucified]] by the Jews, but that he had been raised alive up to [[jannah|heaven]]. Islamic traditions narrate that he will return to earth near the [[day of judgement]] to restore justice and defeat ''[[Dajjal|al-Masīḥ ad-Dajjāl]]'' (''lit''. "the false messiah", also known as the [[Antichrist]]) and the enemies of Islam. As a just ruler, Jesus will then die.<ref name="EoI-Isa">"Isa", Encyclopedia of Islam</ref>

Like all [[prophets in Islam]], Jesus is considered to have been a [[Muslim]], as he preached for people to adopt the straight path in submission to God's will. Islam rejects that Jesus was God or the [[son of God]], stating that he was an ordinary man who, like other prophets, had been divinely chosen to spread God's message. Islamic texts forbid the association of partners with God (''[[shirk]]''), emphasizing the notion of God's [[tawhid|divine oneness]] (''tawhīd''). As such, Jesus is referred to in the Qur'an frequently as the "son of Mary" ("''Ibn Maryam''").<ref name="EoI-Isa"/><ref>Fasching, deChant (2001) p. 241</ref> Numerous titles are given to Jesus in the Qur'an, such as ''mubārak'' (blessed) and ''`abd-Allāh'' (servant of God). Another title is ''al-Masīḥ'' ("the [[messiah]]; the anointed one" i.e. by means of blessings), although it does not correspond with the meaning accrued in Christian belief. Jesus is seen in Islam as a precursor to [[Muhammad]], and is believed by Muslims to have foretold the latter's coming.<ref name="EoI-Isa"/>

==== Ahmadiyya views ====
{{main|Ahmadiyya views of Jesus}}
The [[Ahmadiyya]] Movement, was founded in 19th century India. Ahmadis interpret the Bible to show that Jesus was taken down from the cross while unconscious, not dead.<ref>Jesus in India[http://www.alislam.org/topics/jesus/]</ref>. They believe that he revived, appeared to his disciples in the flesh, and fled eastward to [[Kashmir]], where he died of old age under the name [[Yuz Asaf]] (''"Leader of the Healed"''). They believe his tomb is located in [[Srinagar]], [[Kashmir]]. This view has also been taken up by some western authors and historians.<ref>Ahmad, M. M. [http://www.alislam.org/library/links/00000094.html#8 "The Lost Tribes of Israel: The Travels of Jesus"], [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]], Retrieved [[April 14]], [[2007]]. This view has also been taken up by some western authors, Günter Grönbold, Jesus In Indien, München: Kösel 1985, ISBN 3466202701. Norbert Klatt, ''Lebte Jesus in Indien?'', Göttingen: Wallstein 1988.</ref>

Ahmadis believe that the prophecy concerning Jesus' second coming indicated a spiritual return, and that it was fulfilled in the person of [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], identified as the [[Imam Mahdi]] (Promised [[Messiah]]).

=== Judaism's view ===
{{main|Judaism's view of Jesus}}

Mainstream [[Judaism]] holds the idea of Jesus being God, or part of a Trinity, or a mediator to God, to be heresy.<ref>''[[Emunoth ve-Deoth]]'', II:5</ref> Judaism also holds that Jesus is not the [[Jewish Messiah|Messiah]], arguing that he had not fulfilled the [[Messianic prophecies]] in the [[Tanakh]] nor embodied the personal qualifications of the Messiah.<ref>[[Shraga Simmons|Simmons, Shraga]], [http://www.aish.com/jewishissues/jewishsociety/Why_Jews_Dont_Believe_In_Jesus.asp "Why Jews Do not Believe in Jesus"], Retrieved [[April 15]], [[2007]]; [http://ohr.edu/ask_db/ask_main.php/2637/Q1/ "Why Jews Do not Believe in Jesus"], [[Ohr Somayach, Jerusalem|Ohr Samayach]] — ''Ask the Rabbi'', Retrieved [[April 15]], [[2007]]; [http://www.askmoses.com/qa_detail.html?h=120&o=350 "Why do not Jews believe that Jesus was the messiah?"], [[AskMoses.com]], Retrieved [[April 15]], [[2007]]</ref> According to Jewish tradition, there were no more prophets after 420 BC/BCE, [[Malachi]] being the last prophet, who lived centuries before Jesus. Judaism states that Jesus did not fulfill the requirements set by the [[Torah]] to prove that he was a prophet. Even if Jesus had produced such a sign that Judaism recognized, Judaism states that no prophet or dreamer can contradict the laws already stated in the Torah, which Judaism states Jesus did.

There is, however, there is a small group of people who believe in Yeshua (Jesus) and stay Jewish.  They are Messianic Jews, (read more here [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messianic_Judaism].  They still say the traditional prayers, believe in the old and new Covenants of the Bible (the same as the Christian Bible), and stay true to their Jewish roots, with the God of their ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/article.asp?AID=9977|title=Devarim 13:1–5}}</ref><ref>[[Ephraim Buchwald|Buchwald, Ephraim]], [http://www.njop.org/html/REEH5764–2004.html "Parashat Re'eh 5764–2004: Identifying a True Prophet"], [[National Jewish Outreach Program]], Retrieved [[April 15]], [[2007]]; Tracey Rich, [http://www.jewfaq.org/prophet.htm "Prophets and Prophecy"], ''Judaism 101'', Retrieved [[April 15]], [[2007]]; Rabbi Pinchas Frankel, [http://www.ou.org/about/judaism/history.htm "Covenant of History: A Fools Prophecy"], [[Orthodox Union|Orthodox Union of Jewish Congregations of America]], Retrieved [[April 15]], [[2007]]; Laurence Edwards, [http://urj.org/Articles/index.cfm?id=2819&pge_prg_id=26382&pge_id=3453 "Torat Hayim — Living Torah: No Rest(s) for the Wicked"], [[Union for Reform Judaism|Union of American Hebrew Congregations]], Retrieved [[April 15]], [[2007]]</ref>
<!-- (quotes unnecessary if there's a main article to handle such detail) The ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' (an authoritative work of [[halakha|Jewish law]]) states in ''Hilkhot Melakhim'' 11:10–12:

<blockquote>Even Jesus the Nazarene who imagined that he would be [[Jewish Messiah|Messiah]] and was killed by the court, was already prophesied by [[Daniel]]. So that it was said, "And the members of the outlaws of your nation would be carried to make a (prophetic) vision stand. And they stumbled".<ref>Daniel 11.14</ref> Because, is there a greater stumbling-block than this one? So that all of the [[prophet]]s spoke that the Messiah redeems Israel, and saves them, and gathers their banished ones, and strengthens their commandments. And this one caused (nations) to destroy Israel by sword, and to scatter their remnant, and to humiliate them, and to exchange the Torah, and to make the majority of the world err to serve a divinity besides God. However, the thoughts of the Creator of the world — there is no force in a human to attain them because our ways are not God's ways, and our thoughts not God's thoughts. And all these things of Jesus the Nazarene, and of ([[Muhammad]]) the [[Ishmael]]ite who stood after him — there is no (purpose) but to straighten out the way for the King Messiah, and to restore all the world to serve God together. So that it is said, "Because then I will turn toward the nations (giving them) a clear lip, to call all of them in the name of God and to serve God (shoulder to shoulder as) one shoulder".<ref>Zephaniah 3.9</ref> Look how all the world already becomes full of the things of the Messiah, and the things of the [[Torah]], and the things of the commandments! And these things spread among the far islands and among the many nations uncircumcised of heart.<ref>[http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/e511.htm "Hilchot Malachim (laws concerning kings) (Hebrew)"], [[Torah database#Mechon Mamre.28digital freeware.29|MechonMamre.org]], Retrieved [[April 15]], [[2007]]</ref></blockquote>

According to [[Conservative Judaism]], Jews who believe Jesus is the Messiah have "crossed the line out of the Jewish community":
<blockquote>Judaism has held that the Mashiach will come and usher in a new era; not that he will proclaim his arrival, die and wait centuries to finish his task. To continue to assert that Jesus was the Mashiach goes against the belief that the Mashiach will transform the world when he does come, not merely hint at a future transformation at some undefined time to come... Judaism rejects the claim that a new covenant was created with Jesus and asserts instead that the chain of Tradition reaching back to Moshe continues to make valid claims on our lives, and serve as more than mere window dressing.<ref>{{cite web

[[Reform Judaism]], the modern progressive movement, states:

=== Buddhist views ===
{{see|Buddhism and Christianity}}

Buddhists' views of Jesus differ, since Jesus is not mentioned in any Buddhist text as Buddha preceded him by approximately 500 years. Some [[Buddhists]], including [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama]]<ref>Beverley, James A., [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/june11/15.64.html Hollywood's Idol], Christianity Today, "Jesus Christ also lived previous lives," he said.

=== Hindu views ===
[[Hinduism|Hindu]] beliefs about Jesus vary. [[Contemporary Sant Mat movement]]s regard Jesus as a [[Satguru]]. [[Ramakrishna]] believed that Jesus was an [[Avatar|Incarnation]] of God.<ref name="Ramakrishna">[http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/gospel/introduction/christianity.htm The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna], Introduction by [[Swami Nikhilananda]], p. 34.</ref> [[Swami Vivekananda]] has praised Jesus and cited him as a source of strength and the epitome of perfection.<ref name="vivekananda">{{cite web|url=http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/volume_4/lectures_and_discourses/christ_the_messenger.htm|title=Christ the Messenger|accessmonthday=April 15|accessyear=2007}}</ref> [[Paramahansa Yogananda]] taught that Jesus was the reincarnation of [[Elisha]] and a student of [[John the Baptist]], the reincarnation of [[Elijah]].<ref>Paramahansa Yogananda, ''Autobiography of a Yogi,'' 2nd ed., Crystal Clarity Publishers, 2005.

=== Bahá'í views ===
The [[Bahá'í Faith]], founded in 19th-century Persia, considers Jesus, along with [[Muhammad]], the [[Buddha]], [[Krishna]], and [[Zoroaster]], and other messengers of the great religions of the world to be [[Manifestation of God|Manifestations of God]] (or [[prophet]]s), with both human and divine stations.<ref name="stockman">{{cite journal | title = Jesus Christ in the Baha'i Writings | first = Robert | last = Stockman | journal = Bahá'í Studies Review | volume = | issue = 1 | year = 1992 | url = http://bahai-library.com/index.php5?file=stockman_jesus_bahai_writings}}</ref> In their divine station Bahá'ís view them in essential unity with each other and with God, and in their human station they view them as distinct individuals.<ref name="stockman" /> Thus, in the Bahá'í view, Jesus incarnates God's attributes, perfectly reflecting and expressing them.<ref name="stockman" /> However, the Bahá'í view rejects the belief that the essence of God was perfectly or completely contained in Jesus or any other human body, since [[Bahá'í literature|Bahá'í scripture]] emphasizes the transcendence of the essence of God.<ref name="stockman" /> Jesus is believed to be the "Son of God" though not literally a biological son.

Bahá'ís accept Jesus as the Messiah foretold in the Jewish Scriptures.

=== Mandaean views ===
[[Mandaeanism]], a very small Mideastern, Gnostic sect that reveres John the Baptist as God's greatest prophet, regards Jesus as a false prophet of the false Jewish god of the Old Testament, [[Names of God in Judaism|Adonai]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gnosis.org/library/haran.htm|title=Mandaean Scriptures and Fragments: ''The Haran Gawaitha''|accessmonthday=April 20|accessyear=2007}}</ref> and likewise rejects [[Abraham]], [[Moses]], and [[Muhammad]].

=== Other views ===
The [[New Age]] movement entertains a wide variety of views on Jesus. Some New Age practitioners (such as the creators of [[A Course In Miracles]]) claim to go so far as to trance-[[channeling (mediumistic)|channel]] his spirit. However, the New Age movement generally teaches that [[Initiation (Theosophy)|Christhood]] is something that all may attain. [[Theosophy|Theosophists]], from whom many New Age teachings originated (a Theosophist named [[Alice A. Bailey]] invented the term ''New Age''), refer to Jesus of Nazareth as the [[Master Jesus]] and believe he had previous [[reincarnation|incarnations]] and is presently one of the [[Ascended masters|Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]] ([[deity|deities]] responsible for governing the planet Earth).

Many writers emphasize Jesus' moral teachings. [[Garry Wills]] argues that Jesus' ethics are distinct from those usually taught by Christianity.<ref> Wills, Garry, ''What Jesus Meant'' (2006) ISBN 0–670–03496–7</ref> The [[Jesus Seminar]] portrays Jesus as an itinerant preacher who taught peace and love, rights for women and respect for children, and who spoke out against the hypocrisy of religious leaders and the rich.<ref>[[John Dominic Crossan|Crossan, John Dominic]], ''The Historical Jesus: The Life of a Mediterranean Jewish Peasant'', HarperSanFrancisco (1993), ISBN 0–06–061629–6; [[Robert Funk]], ''The Five Gospels: What Did Jesus Really Say?

Philosopher and atheist [[Bertrand Russell]] saw Jesus' teachings and values as surpassed by other philosophers; Russell writes 'I cannot myself feel that either in the matter of wisdom or in the matter of virtue Christ stands quite as high as some other people known to History. I think I should put [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and [[Socrates]] above Him in those respects.'<ref>[http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/russell0.htm Russell, Bertrand, ''Why I am not a Christian''], March 6, 1927, Retrieved [[April 15]], [[2007]]</ref> [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] saw Socrates and Jesus as foundational to Western culture and criticized them both. He considered Jesus' concern for the weak to be a reversal of noble morality and accused Christianity of spreading the concept of equal rights for all, which he opposed.<ref>Nietzsche, Friedrich.

Christianity spread throughout the [[Roman Empire]] under a version known as [[Nicene Christianity]] and became the [[state religion]] under [[Theodosius I]]. Over the centuries, it spread to most of [[Europe]], and around the world.

Jesus has been [[Images of Jesus|drawn, painted, sculpted]] and [[Dramatic portrayals of Jesus|portrayed on stage and in films]] in many different ways, both serious and [[Jesus in Pop culture|humorous]]. The figure of Jesus features prominently in art and literature. A number of popular novels, such as ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'', have also portrayed various ideas about Jesus, and a number of films, such as ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'', have portrayed his life, death, and resurrection. Many of the sayings attributed to Jesus have become part of the culture of [[Western world|Western civilization]]. There are many items purported to be [[relics of Jesus]], of which the most famous are the [[Shroud of Turin]] and the [[Sudarium of Oviedo]].

Other legacies include a view of God as more lovingly parental, merciful, and more forgiving, and the growth of a belief in a blissful [[afterlife]] and in the [[resurrection of the dead]]. His teaching promoted the value of those who had commonly been regarded as inferior: women, the poor, ethnic outsiders, children, prostitutes, the sick, prisoners, etc. For over a thousand years, countless hospitals, orphanages, and schools have been founded explicitly in Jesus' name. Jesus and his message have been interpreted, explained and understood by many people. Jesus has been explained notably by [[Paul of Tarsus]], the [[Church Fathers]], including [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Martin Luther]], and more recently by [[C. S. Lewis]] and [[Pope John Paul II]]. [[Thomas Jefferson]] considered Jesus' teaching to be "the most sublime and benevolent code of morals which has ever been offered to man."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/co/JeffersonBible/jeffintr.html|title=The Jefferson Bible|accessmonthday=April 20|accessyear=2007}}</ref>

For some Jews, the legacy of Jesus has been a history of [[Christianity and antisemitism|Christian antisemitism]],<ref> "Christian Antisemitism: A History of Hate" by William Nicholls, 1993.

Wilken, Univ. of California Press, Berkeley, 1983</ref> although in the wake of [[the Holocaust]] many Christian groups have gone to considerable lengths to reconcile with Jews and to promote interfaith dialog and mutual respect. For others, Christianity has often been linked to European [[colonialism]].<ref>''Of Revelation and Revolution, Volume 1: Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa'' by Jean Comaroff, John L. Comaroff 1991 University of Chicago Press; ''A Violent Evangelism: The Political and Religious Conquest of the Americas'' by Luis Rivera Pagan 1992 Westminster Press; ''The Americas in the Spanish World Order: The Justification for Conquest in the 17th century'' by James Muldoon 1994 University of Pennsylvania Press; ''An Empire Divided: Religion, Republicanism, and the Making of French Colonialism, 1880–1914 by J.P.
