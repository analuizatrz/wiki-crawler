==History (overview)==

''Southampton's history is very long and very complicated. This section is an overview. For fuller details see''
{{main|History of Southampton}}
 
Archeological finds show that [[Stone Age]], [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]] settlements once existed within the area that is now the modern City of Southampton<ref name=MusArch>Southampton museum of Archeology. Gods House Tower, Southampton.</ref>. 

Archeology also shows that the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] established a settlement shortly after their invasion of Britain in AD 43<ref name=MusArch/> and that there was a [[Roman Road]] linking to Wickham, Portchester and Chichester<ref name=Rance/>. It was an important trading port, generally<ref name=Rance/> agreed to be ''Clausentum''<ref name=MusArch/><ref name=Rance/>. This site is at the modern [[Bitterne Manor]]<ref name=MusArch/>. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] abandoned this settlement circa 410<ref name=MusArch/> 

The [[Anglo-Saxons]] then formed a new, larger, settlement across the [[River Itchen, Hampshire|Itchen]] centred around what is now the St Mary's area. The settlement was known as ''Hamwic'',<ref name=MusArch/> which evolved into ''Hamtun'' and then ''Hampton''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba66/feat3.shtml |author= British Archaeology Magazine |title=Great Sites: Hamwic |date=August 2002 |accessdate=2007-08-09 |quote=Hamwic, which is described as a commercial port (mercimonium). Hamwic (also known as Hamtun) must have possessed considerable administrative importance,}}</ref>. Archeological excavations of this site have uncovered one of the best collections of Saxon artifacts in Europe.<ref name=MusArch/>
Viking raids from 840AD onwards contributed to the decline of Hamwic in the 9th century,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southampton.gov.uk/leisure/history/museums-galleries/ghtower-museumofarchaeology/saxon.asp#0 |title=Saxon Southampton |accessdate=2007-08-09 }}</ref> and by the 10th century, a fortified settlement, which became Medieval Southampton had been established<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southampton.gov.uk/leisure/history/museums-galleries/ghtower-museumofarchaeology/medieval.asp#0 |title=Medieval Southampton |accessdate=2007-08-09 }}</ref>

Following the [[Norman Conquest]] in 1066. Southampton became the major port of transit between Winchester (then the capital of [[England]]) and [[Normandy]]. Southampton Castle was built in the 12th century<ref name=Rance/> and by the 13th century, Southampton had become a leading port, particularly involved in the trade of French Wine<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southampton.gov.uk/leisure/history/museums-galleries/ghtower-museumofarchaeology/medieval.asp#0 |title=Medieval Southampton |accessdate=2007-08-09 }}</ref> in exchange for English cloth and [[wool]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba66/feat3.shtml |author= British Archaeology Magazine |title=Great Sites: Hamwic |date=August 2002 |accessdate=2007-08-09 |quote=larger-scale trade in relatively low value commodities such as wool, timber and quernstones..}}</ref>.

Increasing Traffic congestion in the 1920s led to partial demolition of medieval walls around the Bargate in 1932 and 1938<ref name=Rance/>, but a large portion of those walls remain standing today.  

During the [[Middle Ages]], [[shipbuilding]] became an important industry for the town. [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] famous warship [[Grace Dieu]] was built in Southampton<ref name=Rance>Southampton. An Illustrated History. Adrian Rance. 1986. ISBN 0-903852-95-0</ref>. [[Walter Taylor (Southampton)|Walter Taylor]]s 18th century mechanisation of the block-making process was a significant step in the [[Industrial Revolution]]<ref name=RancePP95>Southampton. An Illustrated History. Adrian Rance.1986. ISBN 0-903852-95-0. pp95-97</ref>. From 1904 to 2004, the [[John I. Thornycroft & Company|Thornycroft]] shipbuilding yard was a major employer in Southampton<ref name=Rance/>, building and repairing many ships used in the two World Wars<ref name=Rance/>.

In 1415<ref name=RancePP48>Southampton. An Illustrated History. Adrian Rance. 1986. ISBN 0-903852-95-0. pp48</ref>, the ringleaders of the "[[Southampton Plot]]" were tried and found guilty of high treason and executed outside the [[Bargate]]<ref name=RancePP48/> in front of troops assembled by King [[Henry V of England]]<ref name=RancePP48/> prior to the army's departure from Southampton to the [[Battle of Agincourt]]<ref name=RancePP48/>. Southampton has often been used for Military Embarkation, also fulfilling that role during 18th Century  wars with the French<ref name=RancePP92>Southampton. An Illustrated History. Adrian Rance. 1986. ISBN 0-903852-95-0. pp92</ref>, the [[Crimean war]]<ref name=RancePP120>Southampton. An Illustrated History. Adrian Rance. 1986.

ISBN 0-903852-95-0. pp170-171</ref>. Southampton was designated No.1 Military Embarkation port during the [[Great War]]<ref name=Rance/> and became a major centre for treating the returning wounded and POWs<ref name=Rance/>. The port of Southampton was also central to the preparations for the [[Invasion of Europe]] in 1944<ref name=Rance/>. 

In 1642, during the English Civil War, a Parliamentary garrison moved into Southampton<ref name=RancePP71>Southampton. An illustrated History. Adrian Rance. 1986. ISBN 0-903852-95-0.pp71-72</ref>. The Royalists advanced as far as Redbridge in March 1644 but were prevented from taking the town<ref name=RancePP71>Southampton. An illustrated History. Adrian Rance. 1986. ISBN 0-903852-95-0.pp71-72</ref>.  

Southampton became a Spa Town in 1740<ref name=RancePP75>Southampton. An illustrated History. Adrian Rance. 1986. ISBN 0-903852-95-0.pp78-79</ref>. It was also a popular site for Sea Bathing by the 1760s<ref name=RancePP78>Southampton. An illustrated History. Adrian Rance. 1986. ISBN 0-903852-95-0.pp78-79</ref>, despite the lack of a good quality beach<ref name=RancePP78/>. Innovative buildings specifically for this purpose were built at West Quay<ref name=RancePP78/>, with baths that were filled and emptied by the flow of the tide<ref name=RancePP78/>.     

For centuries, the only crossings of the river Itchen in this area were at Mansbridge, some distance upstream of Southampton, and at [[Itchen Ferry village]]<ref name=Rance/>. A toll bridge was opened at Northam in September 1799<ref name=Rance/>, connecting the town to Portsmouth via another toll bridge built at [[Bursledon]]<ref name=Rance/>. The [[Woolston ferry|Floating Bridge]] also connected Southampton to [[Woolston, Hampshire|Woolston]] and Portsmouth on the east bank of the [[River Itchen]] in 1836<ref name=Rance/>. The first Cobden bridge was built in 1883<ref name=Rance/>

The town experienced major expansion during the [[Victorian era]]<ref name=Rance/>. The Southampton Docks company had been formed in 1835<ref name=Rance/>. In October 1838 the foundation stone of the docks was laid<ref name=Rance/> and the first dock opened in 1842<ref name=Rance/>. The structural and economic development of docks continued for the next few decades<ref name=Rance/>. The railway link to London was fully opened in May 1840<ref name=Rance/>, though it had been operating as far as Basingstoke since June 1839<ref name=Rance/>. Southampton subsequently became known as ''The Gateway to the Empire''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southampton.gov.uk/leisure/history/museums-galleries/ghtower-museumofarchaeology/postmedievalsouthampton.asp#0 |title=Post-Medieval Southampton |accessdate=2007-08-09}}</ref> 

[[Image:Southampton-TitanicEngineersMemorial.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The memorial to the engineers of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']].]]The port was the original point of departure for the [[Pilgrim Fathers]] aboard the ''[[Mayflower]]'' in 1620.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://southamptonuk.ags.myareaguide.com/?cityguide=tours |title=Recommended Southampton Tours |accessdate=2007-08-03 }}</ref>. In 1912 the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] sailed from Southampton.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://southamptonuk.ags.myareaguide.com/?cityguide=tours |title=Recommended Southampton Tours |accessdate=2007-08-03 }}</ref>.Southampton was subsequently the home port for the transatlantic passenger services operated by [[Cunard]] and their [[Blue Riband]] liner [[RMS Queen Mary]] and her sister ship [[RMS Queen Elizabeth]]. In 1938, Southampton docks also became home to the [[Flying boat]]s of [[Imperial Airways]]<ref name=Rance/>. Southampton Container terminal first opened in 1968<ref name=Rance/> and has continued to expand.

The [[Supermarine Spitfire]] was designed and developed in Southampton, evolving from the [[Schneider trophy]] winning [[seaplanes]] of the 1920s and 30's. Heavy bombing of the [[Supermarine]] factory in September 1940 destroyed the factory and many homes in the vicinity, killing many civilians and workers. [[World War II]] hit Southampton particularly hard because of its strategic importance as a major commercial port and industrial area. Prior to the [[Invasion of Europe]], many components for [[Mulberry Harbour]] were built here<ref name=Rance/>. After [[D-Day]], Southampton docks handled a large amount of military cargo to help keep the Allied forces supplied <ref name=Rance/>. The last air raid was on 5th November 1944<ref name=RancePP169>Southampton. An Illustrated History. Adrian Rance. 1986. ISBN 0-9-3852-95-0. pp 169</ref>. 

Pockets of Georgian architecture survived the war, but much of the city was levelled. Southampton has thus been extensively re-developed since [[World-War II]]<ref name=Rance/>, to a development plan approved in November 1956<ref name=Rance/>. One of the last acts of Southampton Borough Council, prior to Local Government reorganisation in 1974, was to award a contract to build the [[Itchen Bridge]]<ref name=Rance/>. The bridge opened in 1977<ref name=Rance/>

A Royal Charter in 1952<ref name=Rance/>, upgraded University College at Highfield to the University of Southampton<ref name=Rance/>. Southampton acquired [[city status]], becoming the City of Southampton in 1964<ref name=Rance/>.

Southamptons parks and the common were designated public parks in 1844<ref name=Rance/>.

Southampton became a [[non-metropolitan district]] in 1974. However, the city became independent administratively from that county as it was made into a [[unitary authority]] in a local government re-organisation on [[1 April]] [[1997]] - a result of the [[Local Government Commission for England (1992)|1992 Local Government Act]]. The district remains part of the Hampshire [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]].

Southampton City Council consists of 48&nbsp;councillors elected by thirds.  After the 2007 local council elections on [[3 May]] [[2007]]  the Council was split with 18&nbsp;seats each to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], each having gained two, and 12 to the [[Liberal Democrats]]. The Conservatives took control in May 2007, after a Liberal Democrat resigned from her group to become an independent and voted for the Conservative leader Alec Samuels. During the budget setting meeting on [[20 February]] [[2008]], a no confidence motion was passed and Labour and the Liberal Democrats formed a coalition.

In the local elections on [[1 May]] [[2008]], the Conservatives took overall control of Southampton, winning 15 of the 17&nbsp;seats being contested. Both the Labour and Liberal Democrat leaders lost their seats to young Conservative challengers.

There are three [[Member of Parliament|members of parliament]] for the city: Rt Hon [[John Yorke Denham|John Denham]] (Labour) for [[Southampton Itchen (UK Parliament constituency)|Southampton Itchen]], the constituency for the east of the city, Dr [[Alan Whitehead]] (Labour) for [[Southampton Test (UK Parliament constituency)|Southampton Test]]  which covers the west of the city, and [[Sandra Gidley]] (Liberal Democrat) for [[Romsey (UK Parliament constituency)|Romsey]], which includes a northern portion of the city. The [[Boundary Commission for England]] has created the new constituency of Romsey and Southampton North, by enlarging the current Romsey one. The new boundaries encompass the unitary authority wards of [[Bassett, Hampshire|Bassett]] and [[Swaythling]]. It will be in place in time for the 2009 or 2010 General Election.

Southampton's police service is provided by [[Hampshire Constabulary]], its fire service by [[Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service]] and the ambulance service by the [[South Central Ambulance Service]].  Police stations within the city boundaries can be found in [[Portswood]], [[Bitterne]], and [[Shirley, Hampshire|Shirley]], as well as at the Civic Centre in the [[Southampton City Centre|city centre]].  Fire stations are located in [[St Mary's, Hampshire|St Mary's]], [[Sholing]] and [[Redbridge, Hampshire|Redbridge]].

==Geography and climate==
The geography of Southampton is very much influenced by the sea and rivers. The city sits at the northern tip of the [[Southampton Water]], a deepwater estuary, which is a [[ria]] formed at the end of the last Ice Age. Here, the rivers Test and Itchen converge.<ref>''The Port of Southampton''

Southampton has always been strongly connected with [[Shipping|maritime]] history and developments, and the docks have long been a major employer in the city. In particular, it is a primary port for [[cruise ships]], its heyday being the first half of the 20th century, and in particular the inter-war years, when it handled almost half the passenger traffic of the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. Today it remains home to many luxury liners, as well as being the largest freight port on the Channel coast, with several [[container (cargo)|container]] terminals.  Unlike many other ports, such as [[Liverpool]], [[London]], and [[Bristol]], where industry and docks have largely moved out of the city centres leaving room for redevelopment, Southampton retains much of its inner-city industry.  Part of the docks have been redeveloped, however, as the [[Ocean Village (marina)|Ocean Village]] development, a local [[marina]] and entertainment complex. Southampton is home to the headquarters of both the [[Maritime and Coastguard Agency]] and of the [[Marine Accident Investigation Branch]] of the Department for Transport.

During the latter half of the 20th century, a more diverse range of industry also came to the city, including aircraft  and automobile manufacture, cables, electrical-engineering products, and petrochemicals. These now sit alongside the city's traditional industries of the docks, grain milling, and tobacco processing.<ref> {{citeweb

==Transport==
[[Image:Oceanvillagemarina.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Ocean Village (marina)|Ocean Village]] marina]]
As befits Southampton's role as a major port, the city has good transport links with the rest of the country. The [[M27 motorway]], linking places along the south coast of England, runs just to the north of the city. The [[M3 motorway]] links the city to [[London]] and also, by linking to the [[A34 road]] at [[Winchester]] with the Midlands and North. The [[M271 motorway]] is a spur of the [[M27 motorway|M27]], linking it with the Western Docks and city centre.

Southampton is also well served by the [[Network Rail|rail network]], which is used by both freight services to and from the docks and passenger services as part of the [[National Rail|national rail]] system. The main station in the city is [[Southampton Central railway station|Southampton Central]]. Rail routes run east towards [[Portsmouth]], north to [[Winchester]], the Midlands and [[London]], and westwards to destinations such as [[Salisbury]], [[Bristol]], and [[Bournemouth]]. 

Local train services operate in the central, Southern and Eastern sections of the city, with stations at [[Swaythling]], [[St Denys]], [[Millbrook, Hampshire|Millbrook]], [[Redbridge, Hampshire|Redbridge]], [[Bitterne]], [[Sholing]] and [[Woolston, Hampshire|Woolston]].

Southampton Coach Station, which is located near the [[West Quay]] Shopping Centre, was recently refurbished and the range and frequency of services offered by [[National Express]] services make use of the new facilities.

[[Image:Southampton Airport Control Tower.jpg|thumb|right|Southampton Airport Control Tower]]
[[Southampton Airport]] is a regional airport located in the town of [[Eastleigh]], just north of Southampton. It hosts flights to UK and near European destinations, and is connected to the city by a frequent rail service from [[Southampton Airport (Parkway) railway station]], and a number of bus services. 

Whilst Southampton is no longer the base for any cross-channel ferries, it is the terminus for three internal [[ferry]] services, all of which operate from terminals at Town Quay. Two of these, a [[RORO|car ferry]] service and a fast [[catamaran]] passenger ferry service, provide links to [[Cowes|East Cowes]] and [[Cowes]] respectively on the [[Isle of Wight]] and are operated by [[Red Funnel]]. The third ferry is the [[Hythe Pier, Railway and Ferry|Hythe Ferry]], providing a passenger service to [[Hythe, Hampshire|Hythe]] on the other side of [[Southampton Water]].

Buses now provide the majority of local public transport, with significant peak hour congestion in the city. The main [[bus]] operators are [[First Hampshire & Dorset|First Southampton]], [[Uni-link]] and [[Bluestar (bus company)|Bluestar]]. Other operators include [[Brijan Tours]], [[Black Velvet (bus company)|Black Velvet]], [[Stagecoach Group|Stagecoach]] and [[Wilts and Dorset]]. Free buses are provided by [[Uni-link#City-link shuttle service|City-link]] and ''City Loop''.<ref>[http://www.southampton.gov.uk/Images/9.%20Transport%20investment%20plans%20-%20Integrated%20transport_tcm46-160704.pdf Southampton Local Transport Plan 2001/2 to 2005/6] Accessed [[10 May]] [[2007]]</ref> [[Uni-link#City-link shuttle service|City-link]] runs from town quay to Southampton Central Station and is operated by [[Uni-link]].<ref>[http://www.unilink.soton.ac.uk/routes.shtml Uni-link routes] Accessed [[10 May]] [[2007]]</ref> The Uni-link bus service was commissioned by the [[University of Southampton]] to provide access to students who are studying at the university to all parts of the city. The buses run from early in the morning to midnight meeting demands of students who wish to get to the city during the day and leisure places in the evening. There is also a door to door minibus service called Southampton Dial a Ride, for residents who cannot access public transport. This is funded by the council and operated by SCA Support Services. 

There are two main termini for bus services. As the biggest operator, First uses stops around Pound Tree Road, and occupy a lot of space there. This leaves the other terminal of West Quay available for other operators. [[Uni-link]] passes West Quay in both directions, and [[Wilts and Dorset]] drop passengers off and pick them up there, terminating at a series of bus stands along the road. Certain [[Bluestar (bus company)|Bluestar]] services also do this, while others stop at Bargate and some loop round West Quay, stopping between Bargate and Pound tree Road. There was a [[Southampton Corporation Tramways|tram system]] from 1879 to 1949.

Southampton used to be home to a number of ferry services to the continent, with destinations such as San Sebastian, Lisbon, Tangier and Casablanca. A ferry port was built during the 1960s.<ref>http://www.plimsoll.org/Southampton/TheDocks/EasternDocks/OuterDock3.asp The result appeared to be very successful] Accessed 2nd Jan 2008</ref> However a number of these relocated to Portsmouth and by 1996, there were no longer any car ferries operating from Southampton with the exception of services to the Isle of Wight. The land used for Southampton Ferry Port was sold off and a retail and housing development was built on the site. The Princess Alexandra Dock was converted into a  Marina. Now the new Ian Harold Brown car reception area fills the Eastern Docks where passengers, dry docks and trains used to be.
