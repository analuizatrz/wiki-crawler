'''Jean Balukas''' ([[June 28]], [[1959]] &ndash; ?), an [[United States|American]] [[billiards]] player from [[Brooklyn]], [[New York]], ranks among the stellar females players in the history of the sport. Many [[aficionado]]s place her as the greatest female player ever.  

Balukas' rise through the ranks from a young age is legendary. She began playing at four years of age and competed in her first [[Billiard Congress of America]] U.S. Open at a [[wunderkind|precocious]] nine, taking seventh place. At twelve she won her first BCA title and at fourteen her first national women's championship. Her subsequent titles include seven BCA U.S. Open [[straight pool]] titles, six World Open titles and numerous [[9-ball]] and straight pool first place finishes. She was inducted into the BCA's hall of fame in [[1985]] with the added honor of being its youngest inductee.

==Dissension among the ranks==
In the mid to late 1980s, a rancorous dispute occurred in the [[Women's Professional Billiard Association]] in which Balukas was accused of [[Sportsmanship|unprofessional conduct]]. Balukas vehemently denied the charges. There were countercharges of professional jealousy based on Balukas' then virtual domination of women's professional pool. The result was that Balukas reportedly quit the sport in [[disgust]] rather than accept professional sanction. Although she no longer competes professionally, Balukas helps run her family's billiard parlor, Hall of Fame Billiards, located in Brooklyn, New York.
