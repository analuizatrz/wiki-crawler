{{Nihongo|'''''Death Note'''''|デスノート|Desu Nōto}} is a Japanese [[manga]] series created by writer [[Tsugumi Ohba]] and illustrator [[Takeshi Obata]]. The series centers on [[Light Yagami]], a high school student who discovers a [[supernatural]] [[notebook]] dropped on Earth by [[Shinigami#Ryuk|Ryuk]], a ''[[shinigami]]'' ("death god"), that allows Light to kill anyone by writing the victim's name in the notebook. The user must also know the face of the victim to prevent anyone with the same name from being harmed. The story follows Light's attempt to create and rule a world cleansed of evil using the notebook, and the complex conflict between him and his opponents.

''Death Note'' was first serialized in 108 chapters by [[Shueisha]] in the Japanese manga magazine ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]'' from December 2003 to May 2006. The series was also published in ''[[tankōbon]]'' (paperback) format in Japan starting in May 2004 and ending in October 2006, and since then has been translated internationally. The series was adapted into live-action films released in Japan on June 17, 2006, on November 3, 2006, and on February 2, 2008. The [[anime]] series aired in Japan from October 3, 2006, to June 26, 2007. A novel based on the series, written by [[Nisio Isin]], was released in Japan on August 1, 2006.

== Production ==
Ohba said that he decided to create a suspense series because he did not feel that he could have created a "normal fight-style" series and that the genre had few suspense series. Ohba said that he did not derive the ''Death Note'' concept from any single source. He said that one day he thought of a concept involving Shinigami and "specific rules."<ref name="HowtoRead59">{{cite book | last=Ohba | first=Tsugumi | title=Death Note 13: How to Read| year=2008 |page=p. 59| publisher=Viz Media | isbn=1-4215-1888-0}}</ref> After publication of the pilot chapter Ohba said that he did not expect for the series to be approved as a serialized comic as he thought it did not "fit with ''Jump''." Ohba said that when he learned ''Death Note'' received approval and that Obata would create the artwork he "couldn't even believe it."<ref name="HTR174">{{cite book | last=Ohba | first=Tsugumi | title=Death Note 13: How to Read| year=2008 |page=p. 173| publisher=Viz Media | isbn=1-4215-1888-0}}</ref> Due to positive reactions to the series ''Death Note'' became a serialized manga series.<ref name="HowtoRead 58">{{cite book | last=Ohba | first=Tsugumi | title=Death Note 13: How to Read| year=2008 |page=p. 58| publisher=Viz Media | isbn=1-4215-1888-0}}</ref>

Ohba created "thumbnails," consisting of dialog, panel layout, and basic drawings, to be sent to Obata; the editor reviewed the thumbnails and sent them to Obata with the script set in stone and the panel layout "mostly done." Obata determined the expressions and "camera angles" and created the final artwork. According to Ohba he concentrated on the "tempo" and the amount of dialog; he added that he had difficulty in keeping the text from being too long. Ohba said that he tried to make the story concise and did not want too much text as he believed that "reading too much exposition" would be "tiring" and that it would negatively affect the atmosphere and "air of suspense". Ohba set the basic characteristics of his characters while he allowed for Obata to influence the actual character designs. According to Ohba he did not derive the actual plot idea from one particular source.<ref name="HowtoRead59"/> Regarding the backgrounds and props Ohba said that he put descriptions such as "abandoned building" and let Obata wield most of the creative power regarding the backgrounds and props.<ref name="HTR180">{{cite book | last=Ohba | first=Tsugumi | title=Death Note 13: How to Read| year=2008 |page=p. 180| publisher=Viz Media | isbn=1-4215-1888-0}}</ref>

Ohba said that when he decided on the plot he internally visualized the panels while "rolling around in bed," drinking tea, or walking around his house; Ohba said that he needed to feel relaxed while visualizing the panels. After that he drew the panels on white paper in a "very simple manner." The writer added that on many occasions the draft consisted of too many pages and he had to write drafts "two or three times" to find the desired "tempo" and "flow" for the chapter. Ohba added that he liked to read the previous "two or four" chapters "very carefully" to ensure consistency in the story.<ref name="HowtoRead59"/>

Ohba said that his general weekly schedule consisted of five days to create and think about the creation and then use one day pencil and insert dialog into the rough drafts; according to Ohba, after this point he faxed the drafts to the editor. Obata also described his weekly schedule. He said that he usually took one day with the thumbnails, layout, and pencils and one day with additional penciling and inking. His assistants usually worked for four days and Obata used one day to add "final touches." Obata said that sometimes he took "an extra day or two" to color pages and that this "messed with the schedule." Ohba said that on some occasions he took "three or four" days to create a chapter while on other occasions he took a month to create a chapter. Obata said that his schedule remained consistent except when he had to create color pages.<ref name="HTR192">{{cite book | last=Ohba | first=Tsugumi | title=Death Note 13: How to Read| year=2008 |page=p. 192| publisher=Viz Media | isbn=1-4215-1888-0}}</ref>

Ohba and Obata rarely met in person during the creation of the serialized manga; instead the two met with the editor. The first time they met in person was at an editorial party in January 2004. Obata said that, despite the intrigue, he did not ask his editor about Ohba's plot developments as he anticipated the new thumbnails every week.<ref name="HTR174"/> The two did not discuss the final chapters with one another and they continued to talk with the editor.<ref name="HTR180"/> Ohba said that when he asked the editor if Obata had "said anything" about the story and plot the editor responded '"No, nothing" [''laughs''].'<ref name="HTR180">{{cite book | last=Ohba | first=Tsugumi | title=Death Note 13: How to Read| year=2008 |page=p. 180| publisher=Viz Media | isbn=1-4215-1888-0}}</ref>

Ohba said that the series ended more or less in the manner that he intended for it to end; Ohba considered the idea of [[L (Death Note)|L]] defeating Light Yagami with Light dying; he instead chose to use the "Yellow Box warehouse" ending. According to Ohba he had the details set "from the beginning."<ref name="HowtoRead58">{{cite book | last=Ohba | first=Tsugumi | title=Death Note 13: How to Read| year=2008 |page=p. 58| publisher=Viz Media | isbn=1-4215-1888-0}}</ref> Ohba wanted an ongoing plot line instead of an episodic series because ''Death Note'' was serialized and that Ohba wanted a series focused on a cast with a series of events triggered by the Death Note.<ref name="HowtoRead60">{{cite book | last=Ohba | first=Tsugumi | title=Death Note 13: How to Read| year=2008 |page=pp. 60-61| publisher=Viz Media | isbn=1-4215-1888-0}}</ref> ''How to Read 13'' states that the humorous aspects of ''Death Note'' originated from Ohba's "enjoyment of humorous stories."<ref name="HTR194">{{cite book | last=Ohba | first=Tsugumi | title=Death Note 13: How to Read| year=2008 |page=p. 194| publisher=Viz Media | isbn=1-4215-1888-0}}</ref>

====General creative process====
For each chapter the creative process began with Ohba and moved to Obata; both took advice from the editor.<ref name="HTR189">{{cite book | last=Ohba | first=Tsugumi | title=Death Note 13: How to Read| year=2008 |page=p. 188-189| publisher=Viz Media | isbn=1-4215-1888-0}}</ref>

Ohba began each segment by creating a rough draft; he said that his main weakness was including too much information in each panel. Once each draft "goes through a few rounds" and the elements "are decided on" Ohba split the panels and "solidified" dialog, monologues, and "everything else." Ohba included "specific art" in thumbnails if he believed it was needed. Obata took the thumbnails and edited "camera angles" and expressions exhibited by characters. Obata used the thumbnails as models for his final panels. When Obata decided on the content he began drawing. At this point in many cases Obata determined designs of newly-introduced characters and items. After that point, the editor takes the pages and lettering, special effects, and other type are inserted into the pages; at that point the final drafts are finished.<ref name="HTR189"/>

===Pilot chapter===
The ''Death Note'' process began when Ohba brought thumbnails for two concept ideas to [[Shueisha]]; Ohba said that the ''Death Note'' pilot, one of the concepts, became "received well" by editors and attained "positive" reactions by readers.<ref name="HowtoRead 58"/>

Ohba described keeping the story of the pilot to one chapter as "very difficult" and he said that he remembered taking "more than a month" to begin writing the chapter. Ohba added that the story had to revive the killed characters with the Death Eraser and that he "didn't really care" for that plot device.<ref name="HTR215"/>

Obata said that he "really" wanted to draw the story after he heard of a "horror story featuring Shinigami."<ref name="HTR174"/> According to Obata, when he first received the rough draft created by Ohba he "didn't really get it" at first and that he wanted to work on the work due to the presence of Shinigami and that the work "was dark."<ref name="HTR215"/> He also said that he wondered about the progression of the plot as he read the thumbnails and if ''Jump'' readers would enjoy reading the comic. Obata said that while there is little action and that the main character "doesn't really drive the plot" he enjoyed the atmosphere of the story. Obata stated that he drew the pilot chapter "in a way that would appeal to me."<ref name="HTR215">{{cite book | last=Ohba | first=Tsugumi | title=Death Note 13: How to Read| year=2008 |page=p. 215| publisher=Viz Media | isbn=1-4215-1888-0}}</ref>

Ohba brought the rough draft of the pilot chapter to the editorial department. Obata came into the picture at a later point to create the artwork. Ohba and Obata did not meet in person while creating the pilot chapter. Ohba said that the editor told him that Ohba did not need to meet with Obata to discuss the pilot; Ohba said "I think it worked out all right."<ref name="HTR174"/>

=== Conception and design of the Death Notes ===
Obata said that Ohba did not give him suggestions regarding how to design the Death Notes, so Obata possessed free rein. Obata said that he originally thought of the books as "[[Bible]]-like" "something you would automatically think was a Death Note." Obata added that he felt that this design would seem "difficult to use" so he opted for an "easy to use" "college" notebook. Obata said that at a later point he thought of a concept that Death Notes could look different depending on the human era, such as having Death Notes in ancient Japan looking like scrolls and Death Notes in [[medieval Europe]] looking like [[The Old Testament]].<ref name="drawing design 140">{{cite book | last=Ohba | first=Tsugumi | title=Death Note 13: How to Read| year=2008 |page=p. 149| publisher=Viz Media | isbn=1-4215-1888-0}}</ref>

Ohba said that he "randomly" selected numbers for use in various situations. He said that in some conditions he wished to use the number [[four]] since the word {{nihongo|"four" in [[Japan]]ese|[[Wiktionary:四|四]]|shi}} sounds like the word for {{nihongo|"[[death]]"|[[Wiktionary:死|死]]|shi}}.<ref name="HowtoRead 58"/>

===Intent with the series===
Ohba said that he did not have a theme that he wished to express throughout the series. Ohba said that if he had to choose one, he would select "Humans will all eventually die and never come back to life, so let's give it our all while we're alive." He said that he did not intend for Death Note to push an ideology or make a statement about good and evil. Ohba said that Near's statement in Volume 12 about deciding right and wrong is closest to his own personal belief. Ohba said that he understands how debate can form from the story; Ohba says that since the answers to the questions raised become "ideological" and that he believes this development would be "dangerous" and not "interesting in a manga" Ohba decided not to include this aspect in ''Death Note''.<ref name="HowtoThink69">{{cite book | last=Ohba | first=Tsugumi | title=Death Note 13: How to Read| year=2008 |page=p. 69| publisher=Viz Media | isbn=1-4215-1888-0}}</ref>

As a response to the interview question "So the series is meant to be all about enjoying the plot twists and psychological warfare" Ohba responded by saying that the statement is the reason why he was "very happy" to place the story in ''Weekly Shōnen Jump''. He said that, because ''Death Note'' is aimed at "the young" the reader can "push back ideology" and focus on "pure entertainment." Ohba said that if he aimed the series at an older audience he would expect "more debate over the issues" and therefore he believed that the story would have had to develop in that direction.<ref name="HowtoThink69"/> ''Death Note: How to Read 13'' states that debate about good and evil "sometimes" appears in the series and that the "answer" to the debate is left for the reader to decide.<ref name="HTR183">{{cite book | last=Ohba | first=Tsugumi | title=Death Note 13: How to Read| year=2008 |page=p. 183| publisher=Viz Media | isbn=1-4215-1888-0}}</ref>

Ohba responded to the question "If you had to say what the most important thing in ''Death Note'' is, what would it be?" by answering "The human whose name is written in this note shall die" while Obata responded by answering "Impossible to say."<ref name="HTR192"/>

==Production and intent in the anime==
Tetsuro Araki, the director, said that he wished to convey aspects that "made the series interesting" instead of simply "focusing on morals or the concept of justice." Toshiki Inoue, the series organizer, agreed with Araki and added that, in anime adaptations, there is a lot of importance in highlighting the aspects that are "interesting in the original." Inoue concluded that Light's presence was "the most compelling" aspect; therefore the adaptation chronicles Light's "thoughts and actions as much as possible." Inoue noted that, to best incorporate the manga's plot into the anime, he "tweak[ed] "the chronology a bit" and incorporated flashbacks that appear after the openings of the episodes; he said this revealed the desired tensions. Araki said that, because in an anime the viewer cannot "turn back pages" in the manner that a comic reader can, the anime staff ensured that the show clarified details. Inoue added that the staff did not want to get involved with every single detail, so the staff selected elements to emphasize. Due to the complexity of the original manga, Inoue described the process as "definitely delicate" "and a great challenge." Inoue admitted that he placed "way more instructions and notes in the script than usual." Araki added that because of the importance of otherwise trivial details, the notes became crucial to the development of the series.<ref name="Passionsdreams">"Passion and dreams." ''[[Newtype USA]]''. November 2007. Volume 6. Number 11. 50-51.</ref>

Araki said that when he discovered the ''Death Note'' anime project, he "literally begged" to join the production team; when he joined he insisted that Inoue should write the scripts. Inoue added that, because he enjoyed reading the original comic, he wished to use his effort.<ref name="Passionsdreams"/>

Instead, Ryuk tells him of all the events leading up to the Mello/Near arc, about Light Yagami and his rival L.

[[Image:Death Note Kira Game.jpg|thumb|250px|Death Note Kira's Game]]
A ''Death Note'' [[video game]] developed and published by [[Konami]] for the [[Nintendo DS]], entitled {{Nihongo|''Death Note Kira Game''|デスノート キラゲーム|Desu Nōto Kira Gēmu}}, was released on February 15, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ds/action/deathnote/index.html?tag=result;title;0|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|title=Death Note: Kira Game|accessdate=2007-12-17}}</ref> ''Kira Game'' is a strategy game where the player takes on the role of Kira or L. These are just titles, as any character can be Kira or L. The player will attempt to deduce who their enemy is (Kira will try to uncover L's identity and vice versa). This will play out in 3 phases: Investigation, where the player will discuss the case and clues with other characters; Voting, where each member of the investigation team casts a vote on who they suspect is L or Kira based on the player's performance in the previous phase; L/Kira, where the player can either focus their investigation on one member to see if they are Kira (L part) or force a member off of the team (Kira part).<ref name="game">{{cite web|title=Official Konami Website for Death Note|url=http://www.konami.jp/gs/game/deathnote/|publisher=Konami|accessdate=2007-02-03|language=Japanese}}</ref>

== Reception==
[[Shūsuke Kaneko]], director of the film versions of the series, said that the manga series "barely touches" pain felt by the Death Note's victims, so he decided to use a different focus with the film series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://star-ecentral.com/news/story.asp?file=/2006/10/29/movies/15836968&sec=movies|title=The making|publisher=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]|accessdate=2008-06-15}}</ref> [[Tatsuya Fujiwara]], the actor who portrayed Light in the film series, compared the theme of ''Death Note'' to the theme of ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' and viewed ''Death Note'' as a "very eccentric story" that depicts a "very permanent theme."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sinchew-i.com/contests/deathnote/index.phtml?sec=cast|title=cast|publisher=[[Sinchew]]|accessdate=2008-06-15}}</ref>

Tom S. Pepirium of [[IGN]] said that ''Death Note'''s "heavy serialized nature" is what "makes the show so engaging and discussion worthy."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/836/836387p1.html|title=Death Note "Tactics" Review|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2008-06-15}}</ref> Pepirium, saying that translating ''Death Note'' is "no small task," said that Stephen Hedley created a dub with "nothing clunky." Pepirium added that Karl Willems, director of the dub, assembled a "stunning voice cast of professionals" with a "solid tone minus some of the cheesy yelling and screaming of other dubs."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/855/855426p1.html|title=Death Note: "Ally" Review Review|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2008-06-15}}</ref> [[Play (US magazine)|Play magazine]] named ''Death Note'' as the best anime of 2007 in their "2007 Anime Year in Review" feature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playmagazine.com/animeyir2007/index.html |title=Play Magazine's Anime Year in Review 2007|publisher=[[Play (US magazine)|Play magazine]]|accessdate=2008-06-15}}</ref> John Powers of the [[NPR]] show ''[[Fresh Air]]'' finds the show "addicting" and equates its similarity to the American TV series ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]''."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89999028|title=Killer Penmanship in 'Death Note|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=2008-06-15}}</ref>

Douglas Wolk of ''[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]'' said that a rumor circulated stating that the creators intended to create ''Death Note'' to last half as long as its actual run; according to Wolk the rumor stated that Ohba and Obata had been persuaded to lengthen the storyline when ''Death Note'''s popularity increased. In addition he said that fans wrote "thousands" of ''Death Note'' [[fan fiction]] stories and posted them on the [[internet]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/books/review/2007/07/26/death_note/print.html|title=Death strip|publisher=[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]|accessdate=2008-06-15}}</ref>

A.E. Sparrow of IGN reviewed the novel and gave it a 9.5 out of 10. Sparrow said that the author understood "what made these characters click so well" and "captures everything that made the manga the compelling read that it is." Sparrow said that fans of ''Death Note'' who read ''Another Note'' will "find a welcome home" in the Nisio Isin's work that "adds a few more fun layers" to the ''Death Note'' franchise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/865/865077p1.html|title=Death Note - Another Note: The Los Angeles BB Murder Cases Review|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2008-06-15}}</ref> Carl Kimlinger, in ''[[Protoculture Addicts]]'', called ''Death Note'' "morally repellant" and said it "presents a worldview that is both shallow and repulsively misanthropic."<ref name=Kimlinger>Kimlinger, Carl (2008).

The principal, Chris Roger, sent letters to all the students' parents saying "Regardless of the origin of the book, we take the situation very seriously. The safety of our school family is always our top priority. We treat situations like this the same as if a student called in a bomb threat or brought a weapon to school.
