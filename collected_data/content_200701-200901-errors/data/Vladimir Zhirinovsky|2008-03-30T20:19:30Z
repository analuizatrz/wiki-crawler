'''Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovsky''' ({{lang-ru|Влади́мир Во́льфович Жирино́вский}}, formerly ''Vladimir Volfovich Eidelshtein'', born [[April 25]], [[1946]]) is a [[Russia]]n politician, founder and the leader of the [[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]] (LDPR), Vice-Chairman of the [[State Duma]], and a member of the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|Parliamentary Assembly]] of the [[Council of Europe]]. The LDPR describes itself as a centrist, pro-reform democratic party; however it is often described as an [[Ultranationalism|ultranationalist]] party <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7102153.stm BBC NEWS | Europe | Moscow Diary: Campaign circus<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9115420/Zhirinovsky-Vladimir ''Zhirinovsky, Vladimir'' Encyclopædia Britannica Online]</ref><ref>[http://en.rian.ru/russia/20071213/92278399.html Russian ultranationalist Zhirinovsky nominated for president] [[RIA Novosti]]</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,980142,00.html Zhirinovsky Beat Russia's top ultranationalist had a busy week abroad] ''[[Time Magazine]]''</ref>.

==Early life and politics==
Zhirinovsky was born in [[Almaty|Alma-Ata]], the former capital of the then-[[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet Republic]] of [[Kazakhstan]]. In July 1964, Zhirinovsky moved from Alma-Ata to [[Moscow]], where he began his studies in the Department of Turkish Studies, Institute of Asian and African Studies at [[Moscow State University]] (MSU), from which he graduated in 1969. Zhirinovsky then went into [[military service]] in [[Tbilisi]] during the early 1970s. He would later get a law degree and work at various posts in state committees and unions. He was awarded a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in philosophy by MSU in 1998.

Zhirinovsky, whose father was a [[Polish Jew]], began his formal political career in the Shalom Cultural Society, a [[Judaism|Jewish]] organization given support by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet government]] in order to compete with independent Jewish groups which sprang up during the era of ''[[glasnost]]'' under the tenure of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in the latter part of the decade.<ref>[http://www.jcpa.org/cjc/cjc-satanovsky-s02.htm Organized National Life of Russian Jews in the Late Soviet and Post-Soviet Era: a View from Moscow]</ref> (On a private visit to [[Israel]] in June 2006, Zhirinovsky paid his first visit to the grave of his father, Wolf Isakovich Eidelshtein, who is buried in the [[Tel Aviv]] suburb of [[Holon]].<ref name=Haaretz>{{cite news|first=Yossi|last=Melman|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/732918.html|title=The Jewish Side of the Family|publisher=Haaretz|date=2006-06-30}}</ref>)

Although he participated in some underground reformist groups, Zhirinovsky was largely inconsequential in Soviet political developments during the 1980s. While he contemplated a role in politics, a nomination attempt for a seat as a People's Deputy in 1989 was quickly abandoned.<ref>[http://www.panorama.ru/works/oe/zhirinoe.html Zhirinovsky Vladimir Volfovich] Panorama.ru</ref>

==Liberal-Democratic Party==

In 1990, Zhirinovsky, along with Vladimir Bogachev, took initiatives which led to the founding of the [[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia|Liberal Democratic Party]], the second registered party in the [[Soviet Union]] and therefore the first officially sanctioned [[Opposition (parliamentary)|opposition party]]. This party was a joint project of [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU) leadership and the [[KGB]] according to former [[CPSU Politburo]] member [[Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev]]. Yakovlev wrote in his memories that KGB director [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]] presented the project of the puppet LDPR party at a meeting with [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and informed him about a selection of the LDPR leader. According to Yakovlev, the name of the party was invented by KGB General [[Philipp Bobkov]]. However Bobkov said that he was against the creation of this "[[Sergei Vasilyevich Zubatov|Zubatov's]] pseudo-party under KGB control that directs interests and sentiments of certain social groups" <ref> [[Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev]] ''Time of darkness'', Moscow, 2003, ISBN 5-85646-097-9, page 574 ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Яковлев А. Сумерки. Москва: Материк 2003 г.). The book provides an official copy of a document providing the initial LDPR  funding (3 million rubles) from the CPSU money</ref>

In elections that same year, after which Gorbachev became the first [[President of the Soviet Union]], the LDPR officially gathered 8% of the vote. Afterwards, the LDPR garnered a reputation as an ineffective vehicle for opposition against the government, and one that lacked either credibility or authenticity, particularly given Zhirinovsky's vocal support for the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991]]. This view was further encouraged by rumors, denied by Zhirinovsky, that he was an agent of the KGB and that the LDPR was a farcical creation meant to either discredit or distract earnest opposition to the government. Such impressions would last even as the Soviet Union was dissolved and the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|Communist Party]] itself was thrown into an opposition role.

Nonetheless, the Liberal-Democratic Party remained an important force in [[Politics of Russia|Russian politics]]. At the height of its fortunes, the LDPR gathered 23% of the vote in the 1993 Duma elections and achieved a broad representation throughout the country - the LDPR being the top vote-getter in 64 out of 87 regions. This fact encouraged Zhirinovsky to once again vie for the presidential office, this time against incumbent [[Boris Yeltsin]]. The fact that Yeltsin's candidacy seemed seriously challenged by Russian nationalist groups and a rejuvenated Communist Party alarmed many outside observers, particularly in the [[Western world]], who were concerned that such developments posed a serious threat to the survival of Russian democracy, already in a very fragile state. Zhirinovsky became a focal point of harsh criticism and seemed to be the living embodiment of [[authoritarianism]] and [[militarism]] in modern Russia.

For his own part, Zhirinovsky has done a great deal to foster a reputation as a loud and boisterous populist who speaks on behalf of the Russian nation and people, even when the things he says are precisely what many people, at home or abroad, do not want to hear. Zhirinovsky infamously promised voters in 1991 that if he were elected, free vodka would be distributed to all. Similarly, he once remarked, during a political rally inside a Moscow department store, that if he were made president, underwear would be freely available.<ref name=Fedarko>{{cite news|first=Kevin|last=Fedarko|url=http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,979889,00.html|title=A Farce to Be Reckoned With|publisher=''[[TIME]]''|date=1993-12-27}}</ref> He has on several occasions been involved in altercations with other politicians and debate opponents. As a candidate, Zhirinovsky also took part in the [[Russian presidential election, 2000|2000]] and [[Russian presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential elections]].

==Controversies==

Zhirinovsky has been widely accused of [[anti-Semitism]] for statements in which he accused Jews of ruining Russia, sending Russian women to foreign countries as prostitutes, selling children and organs to the Western world, and provoking [[the Holocaust]]. He repeatedly denied his father's Jewishness until he published ''Ivan Close Your Soul'' in July 2001, describing how his father changed his name, Volf Isaakovich Eidelshtein, from Eidelshtein to Zhirinovsky. He rhetorically asks, "''Why should I reject Russian blood, Russian culture, Russian land, and fall in love with the Jewish people only because of that single drop of blood that my father left in my mother's body?''"<ref name="antisemitism">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1446759.stm Zhirinovsky admits Jewish roots] [[BBC News]]</ref> He has expressed admiration for [[United States presidential election, 1996|1996]] [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidential]] contender [[Pat Buchanan]]. Referring positively to a comment in which Buchanan labeled the [[United States Congress]] "Israeli-occupied territory", Zhirinovsky remarked that, "We have the same situation in Russia." He said that both countries were "under occupation" and that "to survive, we could set aside places on US and Russian territories to deport this small but troublesome tribe." Buchanan strongly rejected Zhirinovsky's endorsement, eliciting a harsh response by Zhirinovsky: "You soiled your pants as soon as you got my congratulations. Who are you afraid of? [[Zionists]]?"<ref name="buchanan">[http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/3063/edition_id/54/format/html/displaystory.html Russia's Zhirinovsky now blasts Buchanan as 'crap'] Jewish News Weekly</ref>

He is also well known for his boasts pertaining to other countries, having expressed a desire to reunite countries of the ex-Soviet "near abroad" with Russia, and dreaming of a day "when Russian soldiers can wash their boots in the warm waters of the [[Indian Ocean]]".<ref name="boots">[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/12/08/1070732141347.html Ultra-right gains in poll] ''[[The Age]]''</ref> Zhirinovsky has advocated forcibly retaking [[Alaska]] from the [[United States]], dumping [[nuclear waste]] in [[Germany]], and using [[nuclear weapons]]  against [[Japan]].<ref name="threats">[http://www.acs.brockport.edu/~dgusev/Russian/vzbio.html Vladimir Zhirinovsky] Information Technology Services at SUNY Brockport</ref> He also called for the [[deportation]] of all [[Japanese people|Japanese]] and [[Chinese]] from Russia.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=SX4B7pNG3W8C The Beast Reawakens] By Martin A. Lee</ref> In 1999, at the start of the [[Second Chechen War]], he advocated hitting some [[Chechnya|Chechen]] villages with [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s.<ref>[http://www.rferl.org/specials/russianelection/archives/07-171299.asp Russian Parliamentary Election 1999] [[RFE/RL]]</ref> He was also close to the [[Serbia]]n ultra-nationalist and [[war crime]]s suspect [[Vojislav Šešelj]].

Zhirinovsky hailed what he described as "the democratic process" in [[Iraq]] under [[Saddam Hussein]], whom he supported strongly. The friendship dates at least until the first [[Gulf War]], during which time Zhirinovsky sent several volunteers from the "Falcons of Zhirinovsky" group to support the Iraqi president. Allegations have dogged Zhirinovsky closely since [[2003 invasion of Baghdad|the fall of Baghdad]] that he personally profited from illicit oil sales as part of the [[Oil-for-Food Programme|Oil-for Food scandal]], a charge investigated in 2005 by the Independent Inquiry Committee into the Oil-for-Food Programme ([[Paul Volcker|Volcker]] Commission) and the [[United States Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations|US Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations]] (PSI).<ref>{{PDFlink|http://www.access.gpo.gov/congress/senate/pdf/109hrg/21438.pdf|78.0&nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 81820301 bytes -->}}</ref>

Zhirinovsky also has a history of igniting violence in political contexts.  In June 2003, Zhirinovsky celebrated the eighth anniversary of his notorious debate with [[Boris Nemtsov]] in 1995, during which a "juice fight" broke out. Zhirinovsky had deliberately spilled the contents of his glass, namely fruit juice, onto Nemtsov. The celebration in 2003 involved an open tournament of splashing juice onto one's opponent. This "tournament" was opened by Zhirinovsky himself by splashing juice onto a group of volunteers, and the event was held in the open near a theatre in Moscow.<ref>[http://www.vesti.ru/news.html?id=34546 Жириновский снова брызнул соком] from Vesti.ru</ref> In 2003, Zhirinovsky engaged in a fistfight after a television debate with [[Mikhail Delyagin]].<ref>[http://www.eng.yabloko.ru/Publ/2003/PAPERS/11/031124_mt.html Zhirinovsky Gets Into Fistfight After Televised Election Debate] from ''[[The Moscow Times]]'' mirrored by yabloko.ru</ref> In 2005, Zhirinovsky ignited a brawl in the parliament by spitting at a [[Rodina]] party legislator, [[Andrei Saveliyev]].<ref>[http://newsfromrussia.com/main/2005/03/30/58932.html Flamboyant Russian lawmaker in parliament chamber brawl] from [http://newsfromrussia.com/ News from Russia]</ref>

===Recent controversies===

In 2005 the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] of Kazakhstan declared Zhirinovsky ''[[persona non grata]]'' on the territory of his historical homeland, due to the politician's controversial speech about the change of the Russia-Kazakhstan border, in which he questioned the [[Kazakhs|Kazakh people's]] place in history. Zhirinovsky maintains his view, claiming that his position is backed by a number of academic works on history and geography. Moreover, he called on the government of Kazakhstan not to take offense on the matter.<ref>[http://lenta.ru/russia/2005/02/10/zhirinovsky1/ Жириновскому запретили приезжать на историческую родину] from [[Lenta.ru]]</ref>

In reaction to [[Condoleezza Rice]]'s criticism of [[Foreign relations of Russia|Russian foreign policy]] during the January 2006 [[Russia-Ukraine gas dispute]], Zhirinovsky stated that Rice's comments were a reflection of her own unmarried and childless status, and that "Condoleezza Rice needs a company of soldiers. She needs to be taken to barracks where she would be satisfied."<ref>[http://english.pravda.ru/main/18/88/354/16724_Condoleezza.html Condoleezza Rice's anti-Russian stance based on sexual problems] from [[Pravda]].ru</ref> [[As of 2006]], he was ''persona non grata'' in [[Ukraine]], although this was revoked in 2007.

On the November 2006 death by poisoning of Russian defector [[Alexander Litvinenko]], he said: "''Any traitor must be eliminated using any methods. If you have joined the special services to work, then you should work, but to betray, to run away abroad, to give up the secrets you learned while working - all of this looks bad.''"<ref name="www.ebru.tv">[http://www.ebru.tv/en/News/a.503.html Former KGB Agent Dies] [[Associated Press]]. 24 November 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20061124/spy_kremlin_061125/20061126?hub=TopStories Dead ex-spy claimed Russian agent monitored him] from [[CTV Television Network|CTV]].ca</ref> [[Sergei Abeltsev]], Zhirinovsky's former bodyguard and [[State Duma]] member from the LDPR, also stated: "''The deserved punishment reached the traitor. I am sure his terrible death will be a warning to all the traitors that in Russia the treason is not to be forgiven. I would recommend to citizen [[Boris Berezovsky|Berezovsky]] to avoid any food at the commemoration for his crime accomplice Litvinenko.''"<ref name=Abeltsev>{{ru icon}}{{cite web

In July 2007, in response to questions about Russian troops carrying out extensive war games around the town of [[Pskov]], which reportedly included rehearsals of a Baltic invasion, Zhirinovsky endorsed the forcible re-occupation of the [[Baltic States]].<ref>[http://www.baltictimes.com/news/articles/18220/ Russia threatens Baltic missile build-up] from [http://www.baltictimes.com/ The Baltic Times]</ref>

While some observers were inclined to consider such comments as stark efforts to drum up nationalist support and should not be viewed as anything more serious than electoral fodder meant for domestic consumption, there was great consternation at the fact that in February 1996, months before a [[Russian presidential election, 1996|presidential election]], Zhirinovsky placed second in opinion polls, behind Communist [[Gennady Zyuganov]] and ahead of Boris Yeltsin. In the end, however, Zhirinovsky placed fifth with a 5.7% share in the first round of voting. Since then, the party's fortunes have somewhat stabilized, with [[Russian legislative election, 2003|2003]] seeing a LDPR vote share of 11.7%, while the effect of Zhirinovsky's personality only increased his irrelevancy in successive presidential elections. In 2004, he declined to even [[Russian presidential election, 2004|be nominated by the party]], leaving that role to [[Oleg Malyshkin]], who received a nearly negligible portion of the vote.

While some commentators call Zhirinovsky a [[fascism|fascist]] (Zhirinovsky reportedly praised [[Adolf Hitler]]'s ideology of [[National Socialism]]<ref>[http://www.acs.brockport.edu/~dgusev/Russian/vzbio.html Vladimir Zhirinovsky]</ref>),<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb5037/is_199312/ai_n18302450 Zhirinovsky's A-Z.
