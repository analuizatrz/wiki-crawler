'''Burger King''' ({{NYSE|BKC}}), often abbreviated to ''BK'', is a global [[chain store|chain]] of [[hamburger]] [[fast food]] restaurants. The first restaurant was opened in [[Miami, Florida]] in 1954 by [[James McLamore]] and [[David Edgerton]], and has since used several variations of [[franchising]] to expand its operations. Burger King Holdings is the parent company of Burger King; in the United States it operates under the Burger King Brands title while internationally it operates under the Burger King Corporation banner. It is a publicly traded company with investment firms of [[TPG Capital, L.P.]], [[Bain Capital]], and [[Goldman Sachs]] each owning about 25% of the company.

At the end of its fiscal year 2007, Burger King reported that there are more than 11,300 outlets in 69 countries; 66% are in the United States and 90% are privately owned and operated. The company has more than 37,000 employees serving approximately 11.4 million customers daily.<ref name="2007report">{{cite web |url=http://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/irol/87/87140/2007_AR.pdf |format=PDF| title=BKC 2007 Annual Report |author=BKC publication |publisher=Burger King Holdings |date=October 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-08 |quote=11,283 Restaurants in 69 countries and territories}}</ref> In [[North America]], franchises are licensed on a per store basis, while in several international locations licenses are sold on a regional basis with franchises owning exclusive development rights for the region or country. These regional franchises are known as master franchises, and are responsible for opening new restaurants, licensing new third party operators, and performing standards oversight of all restaurant locations in these countries. The largest example of a master franchise is [[Hungry Jack's]], which exclusively owns, operates or sub-licenses over 300 restaurants in [[Australia]].<ref name=bkcau>{{cite web |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/eating-drinking-places/4275422-1.html |title=Burger King Re-flags Australian Stores |author=Restaurant Business News |publisher=AllBusiness.com |date=[[2003-05-30]] |accessdate=2007-09-29 }}</ref> 

As with other [[multi-national corporation]]s, Burger King has had its share of [[Burger King legal issues|controversies and legal issues]] over the course of its existence. Issues have included trademark disputes, controversies with [[animal rights]] groups, health issues and labor relations. Several of its legal cases, particularly those cases involving trademarks and contractual law, have been [[precedent]] setting in their scope in the United States and abroad. Depending upon its ownership and executive staff at the time, its responses to controversial situations has varied from acceding to demands to refusal to concede its position regardless of the outcome.

The [[Burger King products|Burger King menu]] has evolved from a basic offering of burgers, fries, sodas and milkshakes in 1954 to a larger, more diverse set of offerings that includes several variations of [[chicken (food)|chicken]], [[fish (food)|fish]], [[salad]]s and [[breakfast]]. The [[Whopper]], a sandwich that has since become Burger King's signature product, was the first major addition to the menu by Mr. McLamore in 1957.<ref name="whopper">{{cite web |url=http://www.bison.com/press/pr2-28-02bk.html |title=Burger King Celebrates As The WHOPPER Turns 45 |author=BKC press release |publisher=BizJournals on Bison.com |date=[[2002-02-08]] |accessdate=2007-10-22}}</ref> Not all introductions have had the success of the Whopper; BK has introduced many products which failed to catch hold in the marketplace.<ref>{{cite news |title=Burger King Delivers. |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&s_site=philly&p_multi=PI&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB2A3E145CB415C&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |author=Gerald Etter |publisher=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date=[[1992-09-23]] |accessdate=2007-08-21 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/05-30-2002/0001737292&EDATE |title=Burger King Corporation to Launch BK Back Porch(TM) Griller Sandwiches |author=BKC press release|publisher=PRNewswire.com |date=[[2001-01-18]] |accessdate=2007-10-22}}</ref><ref name="BK-BBlum"/> Some products that have failed in the US have seen success in foreign markets, where BK has also tailored its menu for regional tastes .<ref>[http://www.burgerking.dachan.com/menu01.htm BK Taiwan dessert menu] featuring turnover-style pies</ref><ref>[http://www.burgerking.dachan.com/menu01.htm BK Taiwan menu] featuring chicken thigh meat sandwiches</ref> 

The company's "Golden Age" of [[Burger King advertising|advertising]] was during the 1970s when it introduced its mascot [[the Burger King|the Magical Burger King]], a memorable jingle, and several well known and parodied [[slogans]].

===History===
{{expand-section|It needs more data on the 1970s to mid 1980s period|date=March 15, 2008}}
Burger King's first restaurant, originally called '''Insta Burger King''', was opened on [[December 4]], [[1954]] in a suburb of [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], [[Florida]] by James McLamore and David Edgerton; both alumni of the [[Cornell University School of Hotel Administration]]. McLamore visited the original McDonald's hamburger stand belonging to [[Dick and Mac McDonald]] in [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]], [[California]]; sensing potential in their innovative [[assembly line]]-based production system, he decided to create a version of his own. By 1959, BK had grown to five regional stores in and around the metropolitan Miami area. About this time, McLamore and Edgerton decided to expand BK nationally by using a franchising system; a popular method for expansion due to its low capital cost for the parent company. They formed Burger King Corporation as the parent and began selling territorial franchise licenses to private owners across the US.<ref name="answers">{{cite web |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/burger-king |title=History of Burger King Corporation |author=[http://www.fundinguniverse.com FundingUniverse.com] |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2007-10-24}}</ref>

In 1967, after eight years of private operation, the [[Pillsbury Company]] acquired Burger King and its parent company Burger King Corporation. At the time of the purchase, BK had grown to 274 restaurants in the United States. Even though Pillsbury owned and operated the company, BK was still the object of a series of failed and successful acquisitions and divestitures. In 1973, Chart House, owner of 350 BK restaurants at the time and one of BK's largest franchise groups, attempted to purchase the chain from Pillsbury for $100 million ([[USD]]). When Chart House's bid failed, its owners, Billy and Jimmy Trotter, suggested that Pillsbury and Chart House spin off their respective Burger King holdings and merge the two entities into a separate company, an offer Pillsbury also declined. After the failed attempts to acquire BK, the relationship with Chart House and the Trotters began to sour; in 1979 BK successfully sued Chart House for improperly acquiring locations in Boston and Houston.<ref name="answers"/> In 1984, Pillsbury purchased Chart House's successor DiversiFoods for $390 million ([[USD]]) after a separate, independent $525 million DiversiFoods management-backed [[leveraged buy-out]] of the company failed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_v19/ai_3930610 |title=How Pillsbury 'stole' DiversiFoods for just $390 million |author=Rick Telberg |publisher=Nation's Restaurant News |date=[[1985-09-09]] |accessdate=2007-08-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A02EFDA1238F931A25751C1A962948260 |title=DiversiFoods Net |publisher=New York Times |date=[[1984-12-12]] |accessdate=2007-08-24}}</ref> 

BK, and former corporate siblings, [[Bennigan's]], [[Steak and Ale]], [[Godfather's Pizza]] (part of the DiversiFoods acquisition<ref>{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_v18/ai_3367413 |title=Hyde leaves DiversiFoods-BK; Bolton takes reins as president |author=David Zuckerman |publisher=Nation's Restaurant News |date=[[1984-07-24]] |accessdate=2007-08-24}}</ref>), [[Quik Wok]] and [[Häagen Dazs]] ice cream shops, remained under the Pillsbury corporate umbrella until Pillsbury divested its restaurant holdings in 1989 and sold Burger King to [[United Kingdom|British]] [[alcoholic beverage]] manufacturer and distributor [[Grand Metropolitan]] PLC. In 1989, under the ownership of Grand Met, Burger King acquired many locations of its major [[UK]] rival [[Wimpy Bar|Wimpy]] when the parent company bought the Wimpy's brand from its previous owner [[United Biscuits]] and re-branded them as Burger King, giving it an even greater presence in that country. While other "Wimpy" locations are still in operation presently, they are now independent from BK and no longer have the presence they once did.<ref name="answers"/> In 1997, Grand Metropolitan merged with [[Guinness]] to form a company called [[Diageo]]. Diageo maintained ownership of BKC until 2001 when Diageo decided to focus solely on their beverage products and divest itself of the chain.

By the time of the sale, Burger King's revenues and market share had declined significantly, Burger King had fallen to a near tie for second place with rival [[Wendy's]] in the US market for hamburger chain restaurants.<ref name="slate">{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2102906/ |title=What's wrong with Burger King |author=Daniel Gross |publisher=Slate.com |date=[[2004-06-24]] |accessdate=2007-10-24}}</ref> For many years leading into the early 2000s Burger King and its various owners plus many of its larger franchises closed many under-performing stores.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE7DE123EF93BA35752C0A96E948260 |title=Pillsbury restaurants cutbacks set |author=Calvin Sims |publisher=The New York Times |date=1988-01-08 |accessdate=2007-10-24}}</ref> Several of its largest franchises entered bankruptcy due to the issues surrounding the performance of the brand.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m5072/is_33_23/ai_77757921 |title=Franchisee of Burger Chain Files Chap. 11 |author =Anthony Palazzo |publisher=Los Angeles Business Journal |date=[[2001-08-21]] |accessdate=2007-10-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A01E7D6153BF936A35751C1A9649C8B63&n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/F/Fast%20Food%20Industry |title=Big Burger King Franchise chain files for bankruptcy |author= |publisher=The New York Times |date=[[2002-12-05]] |accessdate=2007-10-24}}</ref> 

In 2002, a [[triumvirate|troika]] of [[private equity]] firms led by [[TPG Capital]], L.P with associates [[Bain Capital]] and [[Goldman Sachs Capital Partners]] agreed to purchase BK from Diageo for $1.5 billion ([[USD]]),<ref name="answers"/> with the sale becoming complete in December of that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/1113/p01s01-usec.html |title=Are private buyouts good for the economy? |author=Mark Trumbull |publisher=Christian Science Monitor |date=[[2006-11-13]] |accessdate=2007-10-24}}</ref> The new owners, through several new CEOs, have moved to revitalize and reorganize the company, the first major move was to re-name the BK parent as Burger King Brands.<ref name="bkcnn">{{cite web |url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/05/12/markets/ipo/burger_king/index.htm |title=Burger King IPO set to fire up |author=Grace Wong |publisher=CNN Money |date=[[2006-05-12]] |accessdate=2007-09-30 }}</ref> The investment group initially planned to take BK public within the two years of the acquisition, this was delayed until 2006.

===International expansion===
While BK began its foray in to locations outside of the [[continental United States]] in 1963 with a store in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], it did not have a large international presence. This situation changed shortly after the acquisition when Pillsbury opened its first international restaurant in [[Canada]] in 1969. Other international locations followed soon after: [[Oceania]] in 1971 with Hungry Jack's and in [[Europe]] in 1975 with a restaurant in [[Madrid, Spain]]. Beginning in 1982, BK and its franchisees began operating stores in several [[East Asian]] countries, including [[Japan]], [[Taiwan]], [[Singapore]] and [[South Korea]].<ref name="answers"/> Due to high competition, all of the Japanese locations closed by the end of 2001.

[[Image:Carrols-LogoCrop.jpg|thumb|right|[[Carrols Restaurant Group]] of [[New York]] is the largest franchisee.]]
<div id=franchises>
When Burger King Corporation began franchising in 1967, it relied on a regional franchising model where franchisees would purchase the right to open stores within a defined geographic region. These franchise agreements granted BKC very little oversight control over its franchisees and resulted in issues of product quality control, store image and design and operations procedures.<ref name=answers/><ref name=Reiter>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=oBj-sPpJDQcC&pg=PA64&lpg=PA64&dq=donald+smith+burger+king&source=web&ots=FhXPdZvuKU&sig=Oc4o4BHLk8esIyTgcjWHuSzdXKA&hl=en |title=Making Fast Food: From the Frying Pan Into the Fryer, 2nd edition |author=Ester Reiter |publisher=[[McGill-Queen's University Press]] |date=March 1996 |page=64 |accessdate=2008-04-06 |isbn=0773513876 |quote=Burger King's early franchising arrangements proved to be troublesome}}</ref>
</div>

<div id=smith rules>
This model remained in place until 1978 when Donald Smith initiated a restructuring of all future franchising agreements, disallowing new owners from living more than one hour from their restaurants, preventing corporations from owning franchises and prohibiting franchisees from operating other chains. This new policy effectively limited the size of franchisees and prevented larger franchises from challenging Burger King Corporation as Chart House had.<ref name=Reiter/> Smith also sought to have BKC be the primary owner of new locations and rent or lease the restaurants to its franchises. This policy would allow the company to take over the operations of failing stores or evict those owners who would not conform to the company guidelines and policies.<ref name=answers/> However, by 1988 BKC parent Pillsbury had relaxed many of Smith's changes, scaled back on construction of new locations and stalling growth.<ref name=nyt-franchises>{{cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0DD1530F937A25752C1A96E948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=print |title=Burger King's Angry Franchises |author=Eric N.

Individual owners also took advantage of the AmeriKing failure; one of BK's regional owners, Miami-based Al Cabrera, purchased 130 stores located primarily in the [[Chicago]] and the upper [[mid-west]] region, from the failed company for a bargain basement price of $16 million, or approximately 88% of their original value. The new company, which started out as Core Value Partners and eventually became [[Heartland Foods]], also purchased 120 additional stores from distressed owners and completely revamped them. The resulting purchases made Mr. Cabrerra BKB's largest minority franchisee and Heartland one of BKH's top franchises.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_50_37/ai_111507745 |title=BK franchisee-led group buys 131 AmeriKing units |author= |publisher=Nations Restaurant News |date=[[2003-12-15]] |accessdate=2008-04-12]] |quote= }}</ref> By 2006, the company was valued at over $150 million, and was sold to [[New York]]-based GSO Capital Partners.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://franchise.business-opportunities.biz/2006/12/29/major-burger-king-franchisee-to-sell-240-restaurants/ |title=Major Burger King Franchisee To Sell 240 Restaurants |author= |publisher=[[the Miami Herald]] |date=[[2006-12-17]] |accessdate=2008-04-12 |quote=}}</ref> Other purchasers included a three way group of [[NFL]] athletes [[Kevin Faulk]], [[Marcus Allen]] and [[Michael Strahan]] who collectively purchased 17 stores in the cities of [[Norfolk, Va|Norfolk]] and [[Richmond, Va|Richmond]], [[Virginia]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boston.com/business/globe/articles/2007/08/17/faulk_joins_other_black_athletes_to_buy_burger_king_franchises/ |title=Faulk joins other black athletes to buy Burger King franchises |author=Keith Reed |publisher=[[the Boston Globe]] |date=[[2007-08-17]] |accessdate=2008-04-12 |quote=}}</ref> and [[Cincinnati]]-based franchisee Dave Devoy, who purchased 32 AmeriKing stores.

[[Image:Mattoon Burger King.jpg|thumb|The Hoots' family ''Burger King'' restaurant in Mattoon, Illinois.]]
As with other [[multi-national corporation]]s, international [[fast food restaurant]] [[chain store|chain]] '''[[Burger King]]''' has had its share of controversies and legal issues over the course of its existence. Issues that involved a myriad of topics have affected all areas of the company; depending upon its ownership and executive staff at the time, its responses to these challenges has varied from acceding to demands to refusal to concede its position regardless of the outcome.

Trademark issues involving the similarly named [[Burger King (Mattoon, Illinois)|Burger King]] in [[Mattoon, Illinois]] lead to a law suit whose outcome helped define the scope of the [[Lanham act]] in the US and an existing trademark held by a shop of the same name in [[Queensland]] forced the company to change its name in [[Australia]].<ref name="hoots">{{cite web |url=http://www.illinoistimes.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A2686 |title=The burger king and queen of Mattoon |author=John Jermaine |publisher=the Illinois Times |date=[[2003-11-20]] |accessdate=2007-09-26 |quote= }}</ref><ref name=bkcau>{{cite web |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/eating-drinking-places/4275422-1.html |title=Burger King Re-flags Australian Stores |author=Restaurant Business News |publisher=AllBusiness.com |date=[[2003-05-30]] |accessdate=2007-09-29 |quote=Hungry Jack's was BK's original franchisee in Australia, but the company could not use the Burger King name at the time because it was already trademarked.}}</ref> Several legal decisions have set contractual law precedents in regards to [[long-arm statute]]s, the limitations of franchise agreements and ethical business practices; many of these decisions have helped define general business dealings that continue to shape the entire market place.<ref name=findlaw>{{cite web |url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&court=US&vol=471&page=462 |title=471 U.S. 462 |publisher=[[Findlaw]] |date=[[1985-05-20]] |accessdate=2008-03-04 |quote=}}</ref><ref name=peloso>{{cite web |url=http://www.invispress.com/law/civpro/burger.html |title=Burger King v.

==Charitable contributions and services==
Burger King has several of its own in-house national [[charitable organization]]s and programs. The first is the Have It Your Way Foundation, a U.S.-based non-profit, [[501(c)(3)]] corporation with multiple focuses on hunger alleviation, disease prevention and community education through scholarship programs at colleges in the US. The other charitable organization is the McLamore Foundation, also a non-profit, 501(c)(3) corporation that provides scholarships to students in the US and its territories.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bk.com/companyinfo/community/hiywfoundation.aspx |title=the HIYW foundation |author= |publisher=Burger King Holdings |date= |accessdate=2007-09-26 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bk.com/companyinfo/community/mclamore.aspx |title=the McLamore Foundation |author= |publisher=Burger King Holdings |date= |accessdate=2007-09-26 }}</ref> Additionally, there is an optional literacy program that partners individual restaurants with community schools in the US.

In various regions across the United States, Burger King and its franchises have aligned themselves with several charitable organizations that support research and treatment of juvenile [[cancer]]. Each year these coalitions hold a fund raising drive called '''A Chance for Kids''', which has the restaurants selling [[lottery]]-style [[scratch cards]] for $1. Each card produces a winning prize that is usually a food or beverage product, but includes items such as shopping sprees or trips. In the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]], BK has affiliated itself with the [[Major League Baseball]] team the [[Boston Red Sox]] and its charitable foundation, the [[Jimmy Fund]]. The group runs the contest in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], in the [[New York city]] area it operates the contest in association with the Burger King Children's Charities of Metro New York and the [[New York Yankees]]. Funds raised in these areas go to support the [[Dana-Farber Cancer Institute]] located in Boston.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jimmyfund.org/cor/special/burger/default.html |title=Burger King A Chance for Kids |author= |publisher=The Jimmy Fund |date=[[2007-07-01]] |accessdate=2007-09-28 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jimmyfund.org/abo/press/pressreleases/2002/072602b.asp |title=Burger King Children's Charities of Metro New York to help Small Fries become Large Fries |author= |publisher=The Jimmy Fund |date=[[2002-07-26]] |accessdate=2008-03-29}}</ref> In Nebraska, the company is affiliated with the [http://www.lizslegacy.com/html/home/index.asp Liz's Legacy Cancer Fund] [http://www.beatcancerforkids.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=18&Itemid=44 BK Beat Cancer for Kids] program at the UNMC Eppley Cancer Center at the [[University of Nebraska Medical Center]] in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beatcancerforkids.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=15&Itemid=30 |title=BK Beat Cancer for Kids |author= |publisher=University of Nebraska Medical Center |date= |accessdate=2008-03-09 |quote=The BK Beat Cancer for Kids Program was established through the generosity of Burger King Restaurants and is one of many outreach and fundraising programs benefiting Liz’s Legacy , the Fund to Advance Cancer Research at the UNMC Eppley Cancer Center.}}</ref> In the [[Pittsburgh, PA|Pittsburgh]] region it funded the establishment of the Burger King Cancer Caring Center, a support organization for the patients, families and friends of cancer patients.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cancercaring.org/aboutbkccc.html |title=Burger King Cancer Caring Center |author= |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2007-09-28 }}</ref>

[[Image:Burger king whopper.jpg|thumb|The [[Whopper]] sandwich, Burger King's signature product.]]
When the company began, its menu consisted predominantly of [[hamburger]]s, [[French fries]], [[soft drink]]s, and [[dessert]]s. In 1957, BK added its signature item, the [[Whopper]]. This quarter pound [[hamburger]] was created by Burger King founders [[James McLamore]] and [[David Edgerton]] as a way to differentiate BK from other burger outlets at the time. The sandwich became famous enough that BK eventually adopted the motto "Home of the Whopper."

One of Donald N. Smith's first changes to the menu was the addition of the Burger King Specialty sandwich line in 1979, which significantly expanded the breadth of the BK menu with many non-hamburger sandwiches including new chicken and fish offerings. The new specialty sandwich line was one of the first attempts to target a specific demographic, in this case adults 18-34, members of which would be willing spend more on a higher quality product.<ref name=jakle>{{cite book |title=Fast Food: Roadside Restaurants in the Automobile Age |author=John A.

In order to appeal to as many demographic groups as possible and better compete with its QSR competitor [[Wendy's]], Burger King added a multi-tiered [[value menu]] in 1993 with items priced at 99¢, $1.99 and $2.99 ([[USD]]). The project called, Operation Phoenix, was an attempt to add not only a value menu but a line of [[value meal]]s.

Burger King was a pioneer in the advertising practice known as the [[product tie-in]] with a successful partnering with [[George Lucas]]' [[Lucasfilm|Lucasfilm, Ltd.]] to promote the 1977 movie [[Star Wars]] film ''[[Star Wars]]'' (later renamed ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]'') in which BK sold a set of glasses featuring the main characters from the film. This promotion was one of the first in the [[fast food restaurant|fast food]] industry and set the pattern that continues to the present. BK's early success in the field was overshadowed by a 1982 deal between McDonald's and the [[Walt Disney Company]] to promote Disney's animated films beginning in the mid 1980s and running through the early 1990s. In 1994 Disney switched from McDonald's to Burger King, signing a ten film promotional contract which would include such top ten films as ''[[Aladdin (1992 film)|Aladdin]]'' (1992), ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1991), ''[[The Lion King]]'' (1994) and ''[[Toy Story]]'' (1995).<ref name="Disney">{{cite web |url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Burger-King-Corporation-Company-History.html |title=Burger King Corporation, Turnaround under Grand Met in the 1990s |author= |publisher=[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/ FundingUniverse.com] |date= |accessdate=2007-11-26}}</ref> A partnership in association with the [[Pokémon]] franchise at the height of its popularity in 1999 was one of the most successful in the industry, rivaled only by McDonald's\Ty [[Beanie Babies]] cross-promotion in 1999-2000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/KIDS+SWARM+BURGER+KING+AS+POKEMON-MANIA+STRIKES.(News)(Statistical...-a083629023" |title=Kids swarm Burger King as Pokémon-mania strikes |author=Jason Kandel |publisher=[[Los Angeles Daily News]] |date=[[1999-11-12]] |accessdate=2007-12-02}}</ref>

Shortly after the acquisition of Burger King by [[TPG Capital, L.P.]] in 2002, its newly hired [[CEO]] [[Brad Blum|Bradley (Brad) Blum]] set about turning around fortunes of the company by initiating an overhaul its flailing advertising programs. One of the first moves by the company was to reinstate its famous ''Have it your way'' slogan as the corporate motto. BK handed the effort off to its new advertising agency, Miami-based [[Crispin Porter + Bogusky]] (abbreviated as CP+B). CP+B was known for having a hip, subversive tack when creating campaigns for its clients, exactly what BK was looking for.<ref name="BK-BBlum"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hispanicbusiness.com/news/newsbyid.asp?id=14482 |title=Burger King Corporation Selects Crispin Porter + Bogusky As Lead Creative Advertising Agency|publisher=HispanicBusiness.com| date=[[23 January]] [[2006]]}}</ref> One of CP+B strategies was to revive the Burger King character used during BKs 1970s/1980s [[Burger King Kingdom]] children's advertising campaign as a [[caricature]]d variation now simply called "the King". The farcical nature of ''the Burger King'' centered advertisements inspired an [[internet meme]] where the King is [[Photo manipulation|photoshopped]] into unusual situations that are either comical or menacing, many times followed with the phrase ''Where is your God now?''.

Additionally, CP+B created a series new characters like [[the Subservient Chicken]] and the faux [[nu metal]] band [[Coq Roq]] featured in a series of [[Viral marketing|viral]] web-based advertisements on sites such as [[MySpace]] and various BK corporate pages to compliment the various television and print promotional campaigns.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mad.co.uk/Main/Home/Articles/be50c1fbeab44225a611af5edb1d4ae7/Burger-King-in-MySpace-campaign.html |title=Burger King in MySpace campaign |publisher=Mad.co.uk |date=[[2006-05-13]] |accessdate=2007-08-27 |type=Fee required}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://marketingtoday.blogspot.com/2005/07/burger-king-goes-tasteless.html |title=Burger King Goes Tasteless |author=Peter Delegge |publisher=MarketingToday.com |date=[[2005-07-31]] |accessdate=2007-08-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/marketing-advertising/advertising/3877633-1.html |title=Burger King's Table Guests |author=Robyn Tippins |publisher=AllBusiness.com |date=[[2006-08-03]] |accessdate=2007-08-25}}</ref> One of the more unique promotions that CP+B devised was the creation of a series of three [[advergaming|advergames]] for the [[X-Box 360]].

The first logo that Burger King used is identified simply as the ''Sitting King'' logo; the first version of [[the Burger King]] character is shown sitting atop the of the sign holding a beverage. The sign has several versions, with the King either sitting atop a hamburger or on an inverted [[trapezoid]] with the company name along the top and its motto ''Home of the Whopper'' below it; some signs did not include the King and only had the inverted trapezoid. This logo was used in one form or another until 1969 when the famous Burger King "bun halves" logo made its debut, and has continued in one form or another until the current day. As implied by its name, the logo is meant to resemble a [[hamburger]]; the logo had two orange semi-circular "buns" surrounding the name, which was the "meat" of the logo. In 1994 BK updated the logo with a graphical tightening, replacing the aging "bulging" font with a smoother font with rounded edges. In addition, all secondary signing, such as roof and directional signs, was also updated with new rounded font.

In 1999, BK again revised its logo. The new Burger King logo is a stylized version of the original "bun halves" logo. BK changed the color of the restaurant's name from red to burgundy, while leaving them sandwiched between two yellow bun halves. The new logo also tilts the bun halves and the [[font]] on an [[Coordinate axis|axis]], has a smaller "bun" motif and wraps the burger with a blue crescent whipping around the buns giving it a more [[circular]] appearance. Most restaurants did not acquire newer signs with the new logo, menus, and drive-thru ordering speakers until 2001. Again all secondary signage was updated with the new logo and sharp type face, and all sign posts were repainted to match the blue coloring of the new crescent from their original black.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.logoblog.org/burger-king-logo.php |title=Burger King Logo |author= |publisher=LogoBlog.org |date= |accessdate=2008-03-10 |quote=In 1969, Burger King established its famous Burger King “bun halves” logo that lasted till early 1990s.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bison.com/press/pr4-14bk.html |title=Burger King Shares Extensive Transformation Plans |author=BKC press release |publisher=BizJournals on Bison.com |date=[[1999-04-14]] |accessdate=2007-10-09 }}</ref>

The Hungry Jack's logo is based on the Burger King "bun halves" design. HJ currently uses a variation of the second generation "bun halves" logo, featuring the smoother font used in the Burger King logo from 1994. Currently, the only region that BK uses a non-Latin text logo is in the Middle East. In those Arabic speaking countries the logo is mirrored and uses Arabic characters; otherwise the logo is identical to the "blue crescent" logo used in the west.
