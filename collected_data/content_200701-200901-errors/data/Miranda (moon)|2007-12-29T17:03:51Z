'''Miranda''' ({{pronEng|mɨˈrændə}} ''mə-ran'-də)'' is the smallest and innermost of [[Uranus (planet)|Uranus]]' five major [[natural satellite|moon]]s.

It was discovered by [[Gerard Kuiper]] on [[1948-02-16]] at [[McDonald Observatory]]. It was named after [[Prospero]]'s daughter in [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[The Tempest (play)|The Tempest]]'' by Kuiper in his report of the discovery.<ref>G. P. Kuiper, [http://adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/PASP./0061//0000129.000.html ''The Fifth Satellite of Uranus''], Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, Vol. 61, No. 360, p. 129, June 1949</ref> The adjectival form of the name is ''Mirandan''<!--- e.g. http://rst.gsfc.nasa.gov/Sect19/Sect19_20.html --->. It is also designated '''Uranus&nbsp;V'''.

So far the only close-up images of Miranda are from the ''[[Voyager 2]]'' probe, which made observations of the moon during its Uranus flyby in January, 1986. During the flyby the southern hemisphere of the moon was pointed towards the [[Sun]] so only that part was studied. It is geologically the most active body in the Uranian system.

Miranda's surface may be mostly water ice, with the low density body also likely containing [[silicate]] rock and [[organic compound]]s in its interior. 

Miranda's surface has patchwork regions of broken terrain indicating intense geological activity in the moon's past, and is criss-crossed by huge canyons. Large 'racetrack'-like grooved structures, called [[Corona (planetary geology)|coronae]], may have formed via [[Rift|extensional]] processes at the tops of [[diapir]]s, or upwellings of warm ice.<ref>{{cite journal

Miranda is one of the few bodies in the solar system in which the equatorial circumference is shorter than the pole-to-pole circumference, likely a consequence of the diapir activity.

Miranda's past geological activity is believed to have been driven by [[Tidal acceleration #Tidal heating|tidal heating]] at a time when its orbit was more eccentric than currently. Early in its history, Miranda was apparently captured in a 3:1 [[orbital resonance]] with [[Umbriel (moon)|Umbriel]], from which it subsequently escaped.<ref>{{cite journal

In the Uranus system, due to the planet's lesser degree of [[oblate]]ness, and the larger relative size of its satellites, escape from a mean motion resonance is much easier than for satellites of [[Jupiter]] or [[Saturn]]. Miranda's orbital [[inclination]] (4.34°) is unusually high for a body so close to the planet. Miranda probably escaped from its resonance with Umbriel via a secondary resonance, and the mechanism of this escape is believed to explain why its orbital inclination is more than 10 times those of the other large Uranian moons (see [[Uranus' natural satellites]]).<ref>{{cite journal

An earlier theory, proposed shortly after the ''[[Voyager 2]]'' flyby and now out of favor, was that a previous incarnation of Miranda was shattered by a massive impact, with the fragments reassembling into the current strange pattern.<ref name="chaikin2001">{{cite web

Scientists recognize the following [[geology|geological]] features on Miranda:
*[[Impact crater|Craters]]
*[[Coronae]] (large [[ovoid]] features)
*[[Regiones]] (geological regions)
*[[Rupes]] ([[Escarpment|scarp]]s)
*[[Sulcus (geology)|Sulci]] (parallel grooves)

==Miranda in popular culture==
*[[Astronomy Domine]], a song by [[Pink Floyd]], refers to Miranda as well as [[Oberon (moon)|Oberon]] and [[Titania (moon)|Titania]].
*In the fictional [[Star Trek]] universe, the crystalline mineral [[dilithium (Star Trek)|dilithium]] was first discovered on Miranda in the mid-21st century. The moon said to be the only naturally occurring source of dilithium in the Sol system. This mineral was, a short time later, used to facilitate [[warp drive]] propulsion systems which allowed spacecraft to achieve faster-than-light travel.
*In [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s [[Mars Trilogy]] the moon is visited by the characters Ann Clayborne and Zo Boone.
