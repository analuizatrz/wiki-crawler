{{Warsaw Uprising}}
'''The Warsaw Uprising''' (''Powstanie Warszawskie'') was an armed struggle during the [[Second World War]] by the [[Poland|Polish]] [[Armia Krajowa|Home Army]] (''Armia Krajowa'') to liberate [[Warsaw]] from [[Germany|German]] occupation and [[Nazism|Nazi]] rule. It started on [[August 1]] [[1944]], as part of a nationwide [[uprising]], [[Operation Tempest]]. The Polish troops resisted the German-led forces until [[October 2]] (63 days in total). Losses on the Polish side amounted to 18,000 soldiers killed, 25,000 wounded and over 250,000 civilians killed, mostly in mass executions conducted by advancing German troops. Casualties on the German side amounted to over 17,000 soldiers killed and 9,000 wounded. During the [[urban combat]]&mdash;and after the end of hostilities, when German forces acting on Hitler's orders burned the city systematically, block after block&mdash;an estimated 85% of the city was destroyed.

The Uprising started at a crucial point in the war as the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] army approached Warsaw. The Soviet army had reached a point within a few hundred meters across the [[Vistula]] River from the city on [[September 16]], but failed to make further headway in the course of the Uprising, leading to accusations that [[Stalin]] did not want the Uprising to succeed.

There is no evidence that the [[Armia Krajowa|Home Army]] coordinated its struggle with the Soviet Army. According to Russian memoirs (for example [[Konstantin Rokossovsky]] who led the Warsaw liberation) the [[Armia Krajowa|Home Army]] tried to liberate the city before (and without) the Soviet army.

The [[Armia Krajowa|Home Army]]'s initial plans for a national uprising, [[Operation Tempest]], which would link up with [[Western Allies]] forces, changed in 1943 when the situation on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] made it apparent that the [[Red Army]], not the Western Allies, would force the Germans from Poland. The discovery of the [[Katyn massacre]] soured Polish-Soviet relations in April, and they never properly recovered; [[Soviet partisans in Poland|Soviet partisans often clashed up with Polish]]. Although doubts existed about the military wisdom of a major uprising, the planning continued nevertheless.

[[Image:Flaga PPP.png|thumb|left|150px|[[Flag of Poland|Polish flag]] with the "[[Kotwica|Anchor]]"]]
The situation came to a head as [[Operation Bagration]], the Soviet offensive, crossed the old [[Polish border]] on [[13 July]]. At this point the Poles had to make a decision: either carry out the uprising in the current difficult political situation and risk problems with Soviet support, or fail to carry out an uprising and face [[Soviet propaganda]] describing ''[[Armia Krajowa]]'' as collaborators and ineffective cowards. The urgency of this decision increased as it became clear that after any successful Polish-Soviet co-operation in the liberation of various towns (for example, in the [[Wilno Uprising]]), the Soviet [[NKVD]] units who followed behind would either shoot or arrest most Polish officers and those Polish soldiers who could not or would not join the [[Polish Armed Forces in the East|communist Polish forces]].

In the early summer of 1944, German planning required Warsaw to serve as [[Festung Warschau|the strong point of the area]] and to be held at all costs. The Germans had fortifications constructed and built up their forces in the area. This process slowed after the failed [[July 20 Plot]] to assassinate [[Adolf Hitler]], but by late July of 1944, German forces had almost reached their full strength again. On [[July 27]], the governor of the [[General Government]], [[Hans Frank]], called for 100,000 Polish men between the ages of 17&ndash;65 to present themselves at several designated meeting places in Warsaw the following day. The plan envisaged the Poles constructing fortifications for the [[Wehrmacht]] in and around the city. The Home Army viewed this move as an attempt to neutralise the underground forces, and the underground urged Warsaw inhabitants to ignore it.

The official Soviet [[propaganda]] line tried to portray the Polish underground as "waiting with their arms at ease" and not fighting the common enemy. As the Soviet forces approached Warsaw in June and July 1944, Soviet radio stations demanded a full national uprising in Warsaw to cut German communication lines of units still on the right bank of [[Vistula]]. On [[July 29]], [[1944]], the first Soviet armoured units reached the outskirts of Warsaw, but were counterattacked by [[German 39th Panzer Corps]], comprising [[4th Panzer Division]], [[5th SS Panzer Division]], [[19th Panzer Division]], and the [[Hermann Goering Panzer Division]]. In the ensuing [[Battle of Radzymin (1944)|battle of Radzymin]] Germans enveloped and annihilated [[Soviet 3rd Tank Corps]] at [[Wołomin]], 15 kilometers outside Warsaw. The Germans crushed its resistance by [[August 11]], inflicting a 90% casualty rate on this encircled Soviet force.

[[Image:Tadeusz Bor Komorowski.jpg|left|thumb|[[Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski]].]]

On [[25 July]] the [[Polish government in exile]] in [[London]] approved the planned uprising in Warsaw. Fearing German reprisals following the ignored order to support fortification construction, and believing that time was of the essence, General [[Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski]] ordered full mobilisation of Home Army forces in the Warsaw area on [[1 August]], [[1944]].

This mobilization decision had some key ramifications with the [[Soviet Union]]. [[Stalin]] decried for not being officially consulted on the uprising and thus suspected subterfuge from his Western allies. In retrospect, both sides were jockeying for regional political alignment, with the Polish Home Army's desire for a pro-Western Polish government and the Soviet's intention of establishing a [[Polish Communist]] regime.

{{main|List of military units in the Warsaw Uprising}}

The Home Army forces of the Warsaw District numbered about 50,000 soldiers, 23,000 of them equipped and combat-ready. Most of them had trained for several years in [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] warfare and [[urban guerrilla]] warfare, but lacked experience in prolonged daylight fighting. The forces lacked equipment, especially since the Home Army had shuttled weapons and men to the east of Warsaw before making the decision on [[21 July]] to include Warsaw in Operation Tempest. Besides the Home Army itself, a number of other partisan groups subordinated themselves to Home Army command for the uprising. Finally, many volunteers, including some [[Polish Jews|Jew]]s freed from the concentration camp in the ruins of the [[Warsaw Ghetto]], joined as the fighting continued.

General [[Antoni Chruściel]], codename 'Monter', commanded the Polish forces in Warsaw. Initially he divided his forces into eight areas:
*Area I ([[Śródmieście]], Old Town)
*Area II ([[Żoliborz]], [[Marymont]], [[Bielany]])
*Area III ([[Wola]])
*Area IV ([[Ochota]])
*Area V ([[Mokotów]])
*Area VI (Praga)
*Area VII ([[Powiat Warszawski]])
*[[Kedyw|Zgrupowanie Kedywu Komendy Głównej]]
On [[September 20]] a re-organisation of this structure took place to fit the structure of Polish forces fighting among the Western Allies. The entire force, renamed the Warsaw Home Army Corps (''Warszawski Korpus Armii Krajowej'') and commanded by General Antoni Chruściel (''Monter''), formed into three [[infantry division]]s.

As of [[August 1]] their military supplies consisted of:
*1,000 [[rifle]]s
*1,700 [[pistol]]s
*300 [[machine pistol]]s
*60 [[submachine gun]]s 
*7 [[machine gun]]s (medium or light, such as the [[MG 42]])
*35 [[anti-tank gun]]s and [[carbine]]s (including several [[PIAT]]s)
*25,000 [[hand grenade]]s (mainly of the 'stick' variety).
In the course of the fighting the Poles obtained further gear through [[airdrop]]s and by capture from the enemy (including several [[armoured vehicle]]s). Also, the insurgents’ workshops worked busily throughout the uprising, producing 300 [[automatic pistol]]s, 150 [[flame-thrower]]s, 40,000 grenades, a number of [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]]s, and even an [[armoured car]] (''[[Kubuś]]'').

On [[August 1]], [[1944]], the German [[garrison]] in Warsaw numbered some 10,000 troops under General [[Rainer Stahel]]. Together with various units on the left bank of the [[Vistula]] River, German forces comprised some 15,000 to 16,000 [[Wehrmacht]] soldiers as well as [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] and police forces. Critically, these well-equipped German forces had been prepared for the defence of the city's key positions for many months. Several hundred concrete [[bunker]]s and [[barbed wire]] lines protected the buildings and areas occupied by the Germans. Also, at least 90,000 additional German troops were available from occupation forces in the surrounding area.

As of [[August 23]], [[1944]], the German units directly involved with fighting in Warsaw included:
*Battle Group Rohr (commanded by Major General Rohr)
*Battle Group Reinefarth (commanded by SS-Gruppenführer [[Heinz Reinefarth]])
** Attack Group [[Dirlewanger Brigade]]
** Attack Group Reck (commanded by Major Reck)
** Attack Group Schmidt (commanded by Colonel Schmidt)
** Various support and backup units
*Warsaw Garrison (''Group of Warsaw Commandant'') commanded by Lieutenant General Stahel

==The battle==
{{Main|Military description of the Warsaw Uprising}}
[[Image:Warsaw 5.08.1944.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Map]] showing Polish [[Home Army]]'s initial positions after five days' fighting ([[August 5]], [[1944]]). The Polish-held areas are marked in black.]]
The uprising began officially in daylight at 17:00 or "W-hour" [[August 1]], a decision which is now regarded as a costly mistake. Although the Germans failed to realise that extra activity and early fights with the insurgents were linked and had not developed a plan for dealing with a major uprising, the Polish forces failed to secure many of their objectives due to a sudden change of plan, incomplete mobilization, inexperience in day fighting and heavier than expected German resistance.

The first two days were crucial in establishing the battlefield for the rest of the fight. Most successes were achieved in the city centre ([[Warszawa-Śródmieście]]) and old town ([[Warsaw Old Town|Stare Miasto]]) and nearby parts of [[Wola]], where most objectives were captured, although several major German strongholds remained, and in some areas of Wola Poles sustained heavy losses that forced them to retreat early on. In other areas such as [[Mokotów]] the attackers almost completely failed to secure any of their objectives. In [[Praga]], on the east bank of the [[Vistula]] (Wisła) river, the German concentration was so high that the Polish forces fighting there were very quickly forced back into hiding. Most crucially, the fighters in different areas failed to link up, either with each other or with areas outside Warsaw, leaving each section of the city isolated from the others.

[[Image:Barykada.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Poles erected [[barricade]]s, such as this one on [[Napoleon Square (Warsaw)|Napoleon Square]], throughout Warsaw, making it difficult for German infantry and tanks to operate. In background: captured [[Hetzer]] [[tank destroyer]].]]
After the first several hours of fighting many units adopted a more defensive strategy while the civilian population started erecting barricades throughout the city. The moment of greatest gains, on [[August 4]], was also the moment at which the German army began receiving reinforcements. [[SS]] General [[Erich von dem Bach]] was appointed commander and soon after began to counter-attack with the aim of linking up with the remaining German pockets and then cutting off the Uprising from the Vistula river.

[[August 5]] is marked by the liberation of the former [[Warsaw Ghetto]] area by insurgents and by the beginning of the [[Wola Massacre]], where approximately 40,000 civilians were slaughtered by the Germans. A critical aim of this German policy was to crush the will of the Poles to fight and bring the uprising to an end without having to commit to the heavy [[city fighting]]; until late September, the Germans were, in fact, shooting all captured insurgents on the spot for the same reason. In other areas, the prime aim of the German troops seems to have been to loot and rape rather than fight, which actually allowed Polish defence to continue against the odds. This German policy was later reversed when the German commanders decided that such atrocities only stiffened the resistance of the Poles to fight their oppressors. From the end of September on, some of the captured Polish soldiers were starting to be treated as [[Prisoner of war|POWs]].

On [[August 7]] German forces were strengthened by the arrival of tanks with civilians being used as [[human shield]]s. After two days of heavy fights they managed to cut Wola in two and reach the [[Bankowy Square]].

The German aim was to gain a significant victory to show the [[Armia Krajowa|Home Army]] the futility of further fighting and make them surrender. This did not succeed. Between [[August 9]] and [[August 18]] pitched battles raged around the Old Town and nearby Bankowy Square, with successful attacks by the German side and counter-attacks from the Polish side. Once again, German demoralizing tactics were demonstrated by targeted attacks against clearly marked hospitals (reminiscent of Luftwaffe attacks against hospitals in September, 1939). German tactics also very much hinged on bombardment through the use of [[heavy artillery]] (including the [[Schwerer Gustav]] supergun) and [[heavy bomber]]s which the Poles, without any [[anti-aircraft]] artillery weapons, were unable to effectively defend against. 

The Old Town was held until the end of August when diminished supplies made further defence impossible. On [[September 2]] the defenders of the Old Town withdrew through the [[sewer]]s, which at this time were becoming a major means of communication between different parts of the uprising. More than 5,300 men and women were evacuated in this way.

[[Image:Uprising sewers.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The Warsaw [[sewers|sewer system]] (map) was used to move insurgent forces, unseen, between the Old Town and the Downtown (''Śródmieście'') and ''[[Żoliborz]]'' districts.]]
The Soviet army captured Eastern Warsaw and arrived on the eastern bank of the Vistula in mid-September. When they finally reached the right bank of the [[Vistula]] on [[September 10]], the officers of the Home Army units stationed there proposed recreating the pre-war [[36th 'Academic Legion' infantry regiment]]; however, the [[NKVD]] arrested them all and sent them to the Soviet Union.{{Fact|date=March 2007}}.

</div>

Soviet attacks on 4th SS Panzer Corps east of Warsaw were renewed on [[August 26]], and forced the Germans to retreat into Praga, and then across the Vistula. The Soviet army containted the [[1st Polish Army]] (''1 Armia Wojska Polskiego''), and some of them landed in the [[Czerniaków]] and [[Powiśle]] areas and made contacts with Home Army forces. Their intiative was however not supported by the Soviet High Command. With inadequate artillery, air support, and numbers, the langing troops sustained heavy casualties and were forced to retreat. After repeated attempts by the 1st Polish Army to link up with the insurgents failed, the Soviets limited their assistance to sporadic artillery and air support. Plans for a river crossing were suspended "for at least 4 months", since operations against the 5 [[panzer]] divisions on 9th Army's order of battle were problematic at that point, and the commander of the 1st Polish Army, General [[Zygmunt Berling]], who ordered the crossing of the Vistula by his units, was relieved of his duties by his Soviet superiors. 

From this point on, the Warsaw Uprising can be seen as a one-sided war of attrition or, alternatively, as a fight for acceptable terms of surrender. Fighting ended on [[2 October]] when the Polish forces were finally forced to [[capitulate]].

===Life behind the front lines===
[[Image:Warsaw Uprising boyscouts.jpg|thumb|right|150px|''[[Szare Szeregi]]'' Scouts also fought in the Warsaw Uprising.]]
In the first weeks of the Uprising on Polish-controlled territory, people tried to recreate normal life in their free country. Cultural life was vibrant, with theatres, post offices, newspapers and similar activities. Boys and girls of the [[Związek Harcerstwa Polskiego|Polish Scouts]] acted as couriers for an underground postal service, risking their lives daily to transmit any information that might help their people. Near the end of the Uprising, lack of food, medicine, overcrowding and obviously indiscriminate German air and artillery assault on the city made the civilian situation more and more desperate.
{{sect-stub}}

===Lack of outside support===
{{main|Lack of outside support in the Warsaw Uprising}}
Limited support in terms of [[airdrop]]s came from the Western allies; particulary the [[Royal Air Force]], in which a number of Polish, Australian, Canadian and South African [[pilots]] flew, made 223 sorties and lost 34 [[aircraft]]. However the effect of these airdrops was mostly psychological, as they delivered much smaller number of supplies then was needed by the insurgents, and many air drops landed outside insurgent-controlled territory.

American support was also limited. After Stalin's objections to supporting the uprising, [[Churchill]] telegrammed [[Roosevelt]] on [[August 25]] and proposed sending planes in defiance of Stalin, to "see what happens". Unable and unwilling to upset Stalin before the [[Yalta Conference]], Roosevelt replied on [[August 26]] with: ''I do not consider it advantageous to the long-range [[general]] war prospect for me to join you in the proposed message to Uncle Joe''.<ref name="CNNS">''[http://www.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/presents/shows/warsaw.rising/interactive/timeline.warsaw/frameset.exclude.html Warsaw Uprising CNN Special]'' - August 26. Last accessed on 11 April 2007.</ref>

[[Image:Uprising airmen.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Monument]] commemorating [[Allied]] airmen who lost their lives over Warsaw.]]
Also of significant note was the existence of an American airbase at [[Poltava]] in the Ukraine, from which an airdrop was made during the "Frantic Mission" in mid-September. However, this action infuriated Stalin, who immediately forbade all Allied presence in Soviet airspace{{Fact|date=March 2007}}. Thus all but one Allied airdrops had to be carried out from faraway [[Brindisi]] in [[Italy]].

Although the Soviets briefly ([[13 September]]&ndash;28) provided some airdrops--but without parachutes and only when the uprising was on the verge of collapse--they prevented Allied assistance by denying landing rights to Allied aircraft on Soviet-controlled territory, and even shot down a number of those which carried supplies from [[Italy]].{{Fact|date=April 2007}} The limited landings by the [[1st Polish Army]] represented the only external force which arrived to physically support the uprising; and even they were curtailed by the Soviet High Command.

One of the reasons given as to why the Warsaw uprising failed, was the failure of the Soviet Red Army to aid the Resistance. The Red Army, which was ordered to halt and therefore positioned just a short distance away on the right bank of the Vistula, was ordered not to link up with or in any way assist the Resistance forces. Post-war political considerations and malice by Stalin are seen as the reason for the Red Army's failure to act. Another possible reason was the 4-5 Panzer Divisions in the 46th Panzer Corps and 4th SS Panzer Corps on the order of battle of German 9th Army holding positions east of Warsaw.

It is likely that Stalin ordered his forces to halt right before entering the city so that the Home Army would not succeed. Had the Home Army triumphed, the Polish government-in-exile in London would have increased their political and moral legitimacy to reinstate a government of its own, rather than accept a Soviet regime. By halting the Red Army's advance, Stalin guaranteed the destruction of Polish resistance (which would undoubtedly also have resisted Soviet occupation), that it would be the Soviets who "liberated" Warsaw, and that Soviet influence would prevail over Poland. The Soviet military gave a shortage of fuel as the reason why they could not advance. Soviet and Polish sources disagree.

==Aftermath==
===Capitulation===
{{main|The capitulation of Warsaw after the Warsaw Uprising}}

:''The 9th Army has crushed the final resistance in the southern Vistula circle. The insurgents fought to the very last bullet. - from the German report on [[23 September]] (T 4924/44)''
</div>
On [[October 2]] General [[Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski]] signed the capitulation order of the remaining Polish forces (''Warszawski Korpus Armii Krajowej'' or Home Army Warsaw Corps) at the German headquarters in the presence of General von dem Bach. According to the capitulation agreement, the Wehrmacht promised to treat Home Army soldiers in accordance with the [[Geneva Convention]], and to treat the civilian population humanely. Fighting was so fierce that [[SS]] chief [[Heinrich Himmler]] remarked: ''One of the most deadly fights since the beginning of the war, as difficult as the fight for [[Stalingrad]]'' &ndash; to other German generals on [[21 September]] [[1944]].

The next day the Germans began to disarm the Home Army soldiers. They later sent 15,000 of them to [[POW]] camps in various parts of [[Germany]]. Between 5,000-6,000 insurgents decided to blend into the civilian population hoping to continue the fight later. The entire Warsaw civilian population was expelled from the city and sent to a transit camp ''Durchgangslager'' 121 in [[Pruszków]]. Out of 350,000-550,000 civilians who passed through the camp, 90,000 were sent to labour camps in the [[Reich]], 60,000 were shipped to death and concentration camps ([[Ravensbruck]], [[Auschwitz]], [[Mauthausen]], others), while the rest were transported to various locations in the [[General Government]] and released.

After the remaining population had been expelled, the Germans started the destruction of the remains of the city. Special groups of German engineers were dispatched throughout the city in order to burn and demolish the remaining buildings. According to German plans, after the war Warsaw was to be turned into a lake. The demolition squads used [[flame-thrower]]s and explosives to methodically destroy house after house. They paid special attention to historical monuments, Polish national archives and places of interest: nothing was to be left of what used to be a city.
By January 1945 85% of the buildings were destroyed: 25% as a result of the Uprising, 35% as a result of systematic German actions after the uprising, the rest as a result of the earlier [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] (15%) and other combat including the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|September 1939 campaign]] (10%).

Material losses were estimated at 10,455 buildings, 923 historical buildings (94 percent), 25 churches, 14 libraries including the [[Polish National Library|National Library]], 81 primary schools, 64 high schools, [[University of Warsaw]] and [[Warsaw University of Technology]], and most of the historical monuments. Almost a million inhabitants lost all of their possessions. The exact amount of losses of private and public property as well as pieces of art, monuments of science and culture is unknown but considered enormous. However, various estimates place it at an equivalent of approximately 40 billion 1939 [[dollar|US dollar]]s. In 2004 the Warsaw self-government authorities estimated that the approximate loss of the municipal property is 45 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] [[2004]] [[dollar|US dollars]] (this includes only the property owned by the city of Warsaw on [[August 31]], [[1939]], and not the properties owned by the inhabitants themselves). The [[municipal council of Warsaw]] is currently disputing whether claims for German reparations should be made. Destruction was so bad that in order to rebuild much of Warsaw, a detailed landscape of the city which had been commissioned by the government before the [[Partitions of Poland]] (18th century), painted by two Italian artists [[Marcello Bacciarelli|Bacciarelli]] and [[Bernardo Belotto|Canaletto]] who ran an arts school there as well, had to be used as a model to recreate most of the buildings.

The city of Warsaw was rebuilt, with the [[Warsaw Old Town|Old Town]] being partially restored to its former state. However, complete recovery as a major European capital only began in the early 1990s after the [[fall of communism]].

In 2004 [[President of Warsaw]] [[Lech Kaczyński]], now [[President of Poland]], established a historical commission to estimate material losses that were inflicted upon the city by German authorities. The commission estimated the losses on at least $31.5 billion in 2004 value.<ref name="Wakt">{{pl icon}} {{cite web|url=http://um.warszawa.pl/v_syrenka/new/index.php?dzial=aktualnosci&strona=aktualnosci_archiwum&poczatek=2004-02&ak_id=171&kat=2|title=Warszawa szacuje straty wojenne|language=Polish|accessdate=2007-03-16}}</ref>

===Political arena===
{{main|After effects of the Warsaw Uprising}}
[[Image:Uprising Grob.png|thumb|right|151px|After the Uprising, one grave was left in the streets of Warsaw.]]
Due to a lack of cooperation and often the active aggressive moves on the part of the Soviets and several other factors, the Warsaw Uprising and Operation Tempest failed in their primary goal: to free part of the Polish territories so that a government loyal to the [[Polish government-in-exile]] could be established there instead of a Soviet [[puppet state]]. There is no consensus among historians as to whether that was ever possible, or whether those operations had any other lasting effect. Some argue that without Operation Tempest and the Warsaw Uprising, Poland would have ended as a Soviet republic, a fate definitely worse than that of an "independent" puppet state, and thus the Operation succeeded at least partially in being a political demonstration to the Soviets and Western Allies.{{Fact|date=April 2007}} In addition, the Warsaw Uprising compelled the Soviets to stopped their offensive in Poland to let the Germans suppress the uprising. Some historians speculate that if they had not stopped their march, they would have occupied all of Germany rather than just the eastern section. {{Fact|date=April 2007}}

Overall Polish casualties were between 150,000 and 200,000; more importantly, many of those lost were the people who would have played important and even critical roles in the country's recovery (although many of the Polish [[intelligentsia]] had already been killed at the time of the Soviet and German invasions in 1939).

===After the war===
[[Image:Warsaw wwII 1.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Warsaw]] monument to the heroes of the Warsaw Uprising.]]
Most soldiers of the Home Army (including those who took part in the Warsaw Uprising) were persecuted after the war: captured by the [[NKVD]] or [[Urzad Bezpieczenstwa|UB]], interrogated and imprisoned, awaiting trials on various charges. Many of them were sent to gulags or executed or just "disappeared". Most of those sent to POW camps in Germany were later liberated by British, American and Polish forces and remained in the West, including uprising leaders [[Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski]] and [[Antoni Chrusciel|Antoni Chruściel]] (in [[London]] and the United States, respectively). 

In addition, members of the Polish Air Force flying supplies to the Home Army, were likewise persecuted after the war and many others "disappeared" after their return to Poland. Once word got back to the Polish flyers still in England, many decided not to return to Poland.

Factual knowledge of the Warsaw Uprising, inconvenient to Stalin, was twisted by propaganda of the [[People's Republic of Poland]], which stressed the failings of the Home Army and the Polish government-in-exile, and forbade all criticism of the Red Army or the political goals of Soviet strategy. Until the late [[1960s|sixties]] the very name of the Home Army was censored, and most films and novels covering the 1944 Uprising were either banned or modified so that the name of the Home Army did not appear. Further, the official propaganda of both communist Poland and the [[USSR]] suggested that the Home Army was some sort of a group of right-wing collaborators with Nazi Germany. From 1956 on, the image of the Warsaw Uprising in Polish propaganda was changed a little bit to underline that the soldiers were indeed brave, while the officers were treacherous and the commanders were characterised by disregard of the losses. The first serious publications on the topic were not issued until the late [[1980s|eighties]]. In Warsaw no monument to the Home Army could be built until 1989. Instead, efforts of the Soviet-backed [[Armia Ludowa]] were glorified and exaggerated.

In the West, the story of the Polish fight for Warsaw with little support was an embarrassment, as was the shock of Home Army soldiers as Western Allies recognised the Soviet controlled pro-Communist regime installed by Stalin; as a result, the story was not publicised for many years.

The courage of soldiers and civilians involved in the Warsaw Uprising, and its betrayal by the Soviet Union, contributed to keeping anti-Soviet sentiment in Poland at a high level throughout the [[Cold War]]. Memories of the Uprising helped to inspire the Polish labour movement [[Solidarity]], which led a peaceful opposition movement against the [[Communist]] government during the 1980s, leading to the downfall of that government in 1989 and the emergence of democratic political [[Representative democracy|representation]].

After 1989 censorship of the facts of the Uprising ceased, and [[1 August]] has now become a celebrated anniversary. On [[1 August]] [[1994]], Poland held a ceremony commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Uprising. Germany and Russia were invited to the ceremony, although there was opposition to Russia's invitation. Moreover, a joke making the rounds suggested that "[[Yeltsin]] should be given a pair of binoculars so he can observe the ceremony from across the [Vistula] river." On [[July 31]], [[2004]], a [[Warsaw Uprising Museum]] opened in Warsaw.
