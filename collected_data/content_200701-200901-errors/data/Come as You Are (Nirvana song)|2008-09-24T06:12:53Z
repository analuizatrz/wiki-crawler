"'''Come as You Are'''" is a song by the [[United States|American]] [[Grunge music|grunge]] band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], written by frontman [[Kurt Cobain]]. The song was released as the second [[Single (music)|single]] from the band's second album ''[[Nevermind]]'' (1991) in March 1992. It was the band's second American Top 40 hit, reaching number 32 on the ''Billboard'' charts. The [[music video]] for the song, the band's first collaboration with director [[Kevin Kerslake]], used imagery that referenced the cover art of ''Nevermind''.

==Origin and recording==
"Come as You Are" was one of the few songs Nirvana recorded onto the rehearsal tape the group sent to producer [[Butch Vig]] prior to the recording of ''Nevermind'' in 1991.<ref>Azerrad, p. 166-67</ref> The group recorded the song with Vig during album sessions at Sound City Studios in [[Van Nuys]], [[California]], in early 1991. Cobain recorded his guitar solo in two takes, as well as three takes of vocals, of which the first was used.<ref name="Berk71">Berkenstadt; Cross, p. 71</ref> Vig then asked Cobain to double track his vocals throughout the entire song. During the harmony overdub session, Cobain accidentally sang the phrase "And I don't have a gun" too early, appearing the fourth time he sings the word "Memoria" after the guitar solo. He decided to keep the mistake in the final recording. Vig sampled Cobain singing "Memoria" from the middle of song and placed it in the background of the song near the end twice.<ref>Berkenstadt; Cross, p. 72</ref>

==Composition and lyrics==
{{Sound sample box align right|Music sample:}}
{{Listen|filename=ComeAsYouAre.ogg|title="Come as You Are"|description=Sample of "Come as You Are" from Nirvana's 1991 album ''[[Nevermind]]''. Kurt Cobain uses a [[Chorus effect|chorus]] pedal when playing his guitar, creating a "watery" effect. | format = [[Ogg]]}}
{{sample box end}}
The song begins with Cobain playing an unaccompanied [[guitar riff]] for eight seconds. Cobain used an Electro-Harmonix Small Clone guitar pedal to give his instrument a "watery" tone during the verses and pre-chouses. He is joined by the rest of the band for the first verse, which is moody and subdued. Once the band reaches the chorus, the song reaches full volume. The shift in dynamics is a technique Nirvana used on many of its songs. The song features one of Cobain's longest guitar solos. "Kurt really did not play a lot of solos", Vig said. "This one is more of a melodic part based on the vocal melody. It's not trying to show off pyrotechnics. It complements the melody of the song."<ref name="Berk71" />

Cobain described the lyrics of "Come as You are" as contradictory, and said the song was about "people and what they're expected to act like".<ref name="Berk71" /> The song's prominent line "And I swear that I don't have a gun" has also been interpreted to mean that Cobain "had nothing to hide from anyone." Cobain was known for writing using heavy metaphor in his lyrics, allowing fans to decide what the words meant to them.

Members of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[post-punk]] band [[Killing Joke]] claimed the main guitar riff of "Come As You Are" plagiarized the riff of their own single, "Eighties". The band, however, did not file a copyright infringement lawsuit, which according to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' was "due to personal and financial reasons." In some interviews, [[Jaz Coleman]] stated he did not file a lawsuit because the members of Nirvana openly confessed to him that they indeed took the riff, which he said was all he wanted to hear.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzjnXpnKue4 | title=Jaz and Youth Interview (video) | accessdate=2006-09-26}}</ref>

However, conflicting reports state that Killing Joke did file a lawsuit but that it was thrown out of court,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.anirrationaldomain.net/articles/current/kerrang120403.html | title=Conspiracy of Two | accessdate=2006-09-18}}</ref> or that it was dropped following Cobain's death.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/music/2003/07/24/killing_interview.shtml | title=Interview with Killing Joke's Geordie | accessdate=2006-09-18}}</ref> [[Geordie Walker]], Killing Joke's guitar player, stated that:<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.anirrationaldomain.net/articles/1992-1996/guitarist1294.html | title=December 1994 Guitarist Magazine | accessdate=2006-09-18}}</ref>

<blockquote>"We are very pissed off about that, but it's obvious to everyone. We had two separate musicologists' reports saying it was. Our publisher sent their publisher a letter saying it was and they went 'Boo, never heard of ya!', but the hysterical thing about Nirvana saying they'd never heard of us was that they'd already sent us a Christmas card!"</blockquote>

==Release==
"Come as You Are" was selected as the second single from the album; it was anticipated that the album's first single, "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]", would be a "base-building alternative cut", while "Come as You Are" would be able to cross over into other radio formats. However, "Smells Like Teen Spirit" became a surprise hit and boosted the band's popularity, whereas "Come as You Are" served to maintain it.<ref>Azerrad, p. 227</ref>

After its release as a single in March 1992, "Come as You Are" peaked at number 32 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100; it was the band's second and last American [[Top 40]] hit.<ref name="Billboard singles">[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Singles&model.vnuArtistId=5316&model.vnuAlbumId=810092 Nirvana Artist Chart History: Singles]. Billboard.com. Retrieved on [[June 4]], [[2008]].</ref> The single stayed on the chart for 18 weeks.<ref name="RS CAYA">"[http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6596290/come_as_you_are Come As You Are]". ''Rolling Stone''. [[December 9]], [[2004]]. Retrieved on [[June 4]], [[2008]].</ref> The song also reached number three on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream]] and [[Hot Modern Rock Tracks|Modern Rock Tracks]] charts.<ref name="Billboard singles" />

==Music video==
The music video was directed by [[Kevin Kerslake]], who later directed the videos for "[[Lithium (Nirvana song)|Lithium]]," "[[In Bloom]]," and "[[Sliver (song)|Sliver]]." After the unsatisfactory experience filming the "Smells Like Teen Spirit" with [[Samuel Bayer]], Cobain selected Kerslake due to his impressionisic style. Cobain was unable to formulate any ideas beyond homaging the ''Nevermind'' album cover and including "a lot of purples and reds", so he let Kerslake conceptualize the clip.<ref name="azerrad246">Azerrad, p. 246</ref> The band shot outdoor footage in a park in [[Hollywood Hills]] a few days prior to the main video shoot. Kerslake projected this footage in the background of many shots in the main part of the video.<ref>Azerrad, p. 247</ref>

The video features the band in a dark room, where the appearance of falling water in front of the band distorts and blurs the band members' faces (an idea suggested by Cobain).<ref name="azerrad246" /> Throughout the video, clips such as cells multiplying at an incredible rate, to a living organism in its embryotic stages are shown. The video clip also features Kurt Cobain swinging away on a chandelier throughout the room, and water begins to flow into the room. In addition, the video shows parts involving a dog wearing a cone collar. Images of a baby swimming underwater (a reference to the cover of ''Nevermind'') and a gun floating appear. Towards the end, a clip of the band appears, with Cobain in the front, lying on the ground and kissing the camera.

==Welcome to Aberdeen==
[[Image:Welcome to Aberdeen cropped.jpg|thumb|Tribute to Kurt Cobain in [[Aberdeen, Washington|Aberdeen]]]]
In 2005, a sign was put up in [[Aberdeen, Washington]], Cobain's hometown, that reads "Welcome to Aberdeen - Come As You Are" as a tribute to Cobain. The sign was paid for and created by the Kurt Cobain Memorial Committee, a non-profit organization created in May 2004 to honor Cobain. Founded by author [[Jeff Burlingame]] and Aberdeen City Councilman Paul Fritts, the Committee also plans to create a Kurt Cobain Memorial Park and a youth center in Aberdeen.
