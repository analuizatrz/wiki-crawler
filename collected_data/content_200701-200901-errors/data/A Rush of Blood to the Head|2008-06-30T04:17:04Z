'''''A Rush of Blood to the Head''''' is the second [[album]] by [[England|English]] [[Rock music|rock]] [[Musical ensemble|band]] [[Coldplay]], released on [[August 26]], [[2002]] in the [[UK]] and on [[August 27]] in the [[U.S.]]. It was as successful as, if not more than, its predecessor, ''[[Parachutes]]'', debuting at #1 in the [[United Kingdom]], moving 273,000 copies, and at #5 in the [[United States]], moving 144,000 copies in the first week.

The album includes "guitar-pop" singles ("[[In My Place]]", "[[God Put a Smile upon Your Face]]"), [[ballad]]s ("[[The Scientist (song)|The Scientist]]", "Warning Sign"), and acoustic songs ("Green Eyes"). However, the [[U2]]-esque [[arena rock|epic rock]] of the album's opening track "Politik," the piano-driven "[[Clocks (song)|Clocks]]", and the loud guitars of "A Whisper" were seen to extend the band's musical range. The album also had greater use of [[piano]] than Coldplay's debut album or that of many other rock bands popular at the time. "Clocks," a song centered around a cyclic piano riff and included on the album only at the last minute, ultimately became the band's largest hit to date, earning the band a [[Grammy]] for [[Record of the Year]].

''A Rush of Blood to the Head'' also won the [[2002]] Grammy for [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album|Best Alternative Album]]. The album received generally excellent reviews, and many critics considered it better than Coldplay's first album, ''[[Parachutes]]''. {{RS500|473}}
