'''Charles Frederick Henry Prince''' (born [[11 September]], [[1874]] in [[Boshof]], [[Orange Free State]], died [[2 February]], [[1949]] in [[Wynberg]], [[Cape Province]]) was a [[South Africa]]n [[cricketer]] who played in one [[Test cricket|Test]] in 1899.

Prince was a lower-order right-handed batsman and a wicket-keeper who played from 1894 for [[Western Province cricket team|Western Province]]. He later played for both [[Border cricket team|Border]] and [[Eastern Province cricket team|Eastern Province]]. 

His one Test match was the second match of the 1898-99 series against the [[English cricket team]] led by [[Lord Hawke]]. [[South African cricket team|South Africa]], having led by 85 on the first innings, were dismissed for just 35 in the second innings and lost the match by 210 runs. Prince scored 5 and 1, did not keep wicket and never played Test cricket again.

In 1901, Prince was a member of an unofficial South African side that visited England at the height of the Boer War; no Tests were played on that tour, but several matches were arranged against [[first-class cricket|first-class]] counties. He retired after the 1904-05 season.
