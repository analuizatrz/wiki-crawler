The '''Tasman Bridge''' is a five-lane [[bridge]] crossing the [[Derwent River, Tasmania|Derwent River]], near the [[Central business district|CBD]] of [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]].
The bridge has a total length (including approaches) of 1,395 metres (4,576&nbsp;ft) &ndash; longer than the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]].  It provides the main traffic route from the CBD (on the western shore) to the eastern shore - particularly [[Hobart International Airport]] and [[Bellerive Oval]]. It has a [[pedestrian]] footway on each side, but no dedicated lane for [[bicycle]]s.  However, steps to the pedestrian footway have recently been replaced with on-ramps.

==History==
In the 1950's with the development of the Eastern shore (the old [[Hobart Bridge]] faced increasing difficulty in managing the larger volumes of [[traffic]], and the bridge itself - constantly raising the lift span for shipping) it was decided to build a larger bridge. Construction started on the bridge in [[1960]]. It was completed, and then opened to traffic on [[August 17]], [[1964]] as a four lane bridge.

==Disaster==
On Sunday [[January 5]], [[1975]], at 9:27 p.m. Australian Eastern Standard Time, the Tasman Bridge was struck by the bulk ore carrier ''[[Lake Illawarra (ship)|Lake Illawarra]]'', bound for the Electrolytic Zinc Company with a cargo of 10,000 tons of zinc concentrate (AusStats, 2002). It caused two pylons and three sections of concrete decking, totalling 127 metres (417&nbsp;ft), to fall from the bridge and sink the ship. Seven of the ship's crewmen were killed, and five motorists died when four cars drove over the collapsed sections before the traffic was stopped. A major press shot showed a 3,000km old [[Holden Monaro]] GTS, along with an older EK Holden station wagon, perched balancing on the ledge.

The depth of the river at this point (35 metres (115&nbsp;ft)) is such that the wreck of ''Lake Illawarra'' lies on the bottom, with concrete slab on top of it, without presenting a navigation hazard to smaller vessels.

The breakage of an important arterial link isolated the residents in Hobart’s eastern suburbs – the relatively short drive across the Tasman Bridge to the city suddenly became a 50 kilometre (31&nbsp;mi) journey via the estuary's next bridge at [[Bridgewater, Tasmania|Bridgewater]]. The only other vehicular crossing within Hobart after the bridge collapsed was the Risdon Punt, a [[cable ferry]] which crossed the river from East Risdon and Risdon, some five kilometres upstream from the bridge. However, it was totally inadequate, carrying only eight cars on each crossing, and although ferries provided a service across the Derwent River, it was not until December 1975 that a single lane [[Bailey bridge]] was opened to traffic, thereby restoring some connectivity.

The separation of Hobart saw an immediate surge in the small and limited ferry service then operating across the river. In a primary position to provide a service were the two ships of [[Robert Clifford (mariner)|Robert Clifford]], a Tasmanian mariner. He had introduced the locally-built ferries ''Matthew Brady'' and ''James McCabe'' to the river crossing, from the Central Business District of Hobart to the eastern shore, shortly before the collision. These two ships were soon joined by the ''Cartela'', a wooden vessel of 1912 vintage, and other ships pressed into service by the Tasmanian Government, to ferry thousands of commuters across the river. 

Following successful rebuilding of the Bridge, Clifford's organisation saw the ferry traffic fade quickly, but by then he had diversified into further building of ships. His company, [[Incat]], has successfully exported vessels to China, Europe, and built vessels for the [[United States Navy]]. The company is one of the largest employers in Tasmania.

==Reconstruction==
Reconstruction of the Tasman Bridge commenced in October [[1975]] and included the addition of a 5th lane. Another important factor of the reconstruction is the improved safety measures.  Some examples:
*Large vessels passing beneath the bridge must now do so slightly to the west of the original main navigation span.
*Personnel controlling ships (or [[harbour pilot]]s) must be trained and then cleared for using the special [[laser]] [[lighthouse]] that indicates by colours whether the ship must be steered left or right to regain the centre line.
*All road traffic is now halted whilst large vessels transit beneath the bridge. 

The bridge officially reopened on [[October 8]], [[1977]].
