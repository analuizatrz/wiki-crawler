The '''United States national cricket team''' is the team that represents the [[United States of America]] in international [[cricket]] matches. The team became an associate member of the [[International Cricket Council]] in 1965. The [[United States of America Cricket Association]] (USACA) was suspended by the ICC for&nbsp;&ndash; amongst other things&nbsp;&ndash; failure to hold office-bearers elections under the terms of a new constitution. However, as of April 1, 2008, the necessary reformations have been made under the supervision of the West Indies Cricket Board and the ICC has welcomed the USACA back into the council.<ref>[http://icc-cricket.yahoo.com/media-release/2008/april/media-release20080401-2.html United States of America Cricket Association re-recognised by ICC | ICC Cricket News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==History==

{{main|History of United States cricket}}

===Beginnings===

Cricket was first played in the United States in the 18th century.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.smithsonianmagazine.com/issues/2006/october/cricket.php | title = Smithsonian Institution Magazine: Cricket, Anyone? | accessdate=2006-12-05}}</ref> It is understood from anecdotal evidence that [[George Washington]] was a strong supporter of cricket, participating at least one occasion in games of cricket with his troops at [[Valley Forge]] during the [[American Revolution]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.americanrevwar.homestead.com/files/VALLEY.HTM | title = The American Revolution Webpage: The Winter At Valley Forge | accessdate=2006-12-05}}</ref> [[John Adams]] was recorded as saying in [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] that if leaders of cricket clubs could be called "presidents", there was no reason why the leader of the new nation could not be called the same.<ref>[http://www.cricinfo.com/db/NATIONAL/ICC_MEMBERS/USA/USA_HISTORY.html USA cricket history at cricinfo]</ref>

In 1844, the United States particpated in the [[United States v Canada (1844)|first international cricket match]]. This was played against [[Canada national cricket team|Canada]] at the [[St George's Cricket Club]] Ground, [[Bloomingdale Park]], [[New York]].<ref name='CricInfoArticle'> {{cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/usa/content/story/141158.html |title=Cricinfo - Cricket in the USA |last=Das |first=Deb |accessdate=2007-03-09 |date=None Given |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] }}</ref> This first international sporting event was attended by 20,000 people and established the longest international sporting rivalry in the modern era.<ref name='CricClub'> {{cite web|url=http://cricketclub.org/can_usa.html |title=Canada Versus United States of America Cricket 1844 St George Cricket Club Ground, Manhattan, New York |accessdate=2007-03-09 |last= |first= |date=None Given |publisher=Cricket Club }}</ref> Wagers of around $120,000 were placed on the outcome of the match. This is equivalent to around $1.5 million in 2007.<ref name='Canada Cricket'> {{cite web|url=http://www.canadacricket.com/cgi-bin/coranto/viewnews.cgi?id=EEVlEFlyZuRgpCgjDK |title=Canada Cricket Online |accessdate=2007-03-09 |last= |first= |date=None Given |publisher=Canada Cricket }}</ref>

Sides from England toured North America (taking in both the USA and Canada) following the English cricket seasons of 1859, 1868 and 1872. These were organised as purely commercial ventures. Most of the matches of these early touring teams were played "against odds", that is to say the home team was permitted to have more than eleven players (usually twenty-two) in order to make a more even contest.<ref>[[Alan Gibson]], ''The Cricket Captains of England'', The Pavilion Library, 1989, ISBN 1-85145-390-3, 4-7.</ref>

===Decline===

In spite of cricket's popularity in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the game was supplanted by [[baseball]] in the 1850s and 1860s. As interest in baseball rose, the rules of that game were changed slightly to increase its popularity. For example, easily manufactured round [[baseball bat|bats]] were introduced to contrast the flat [[cricket bat|bats]] of cricket.<ref name='Seattle Cricket'> {{cite web|url=http://www.seattlecricket.com/history/bsblckt.htm|title=Early Baseball and Cricket in America |accessdate=2007-03-09 |last= |first= |date=None Given |publisher=Seattle Cricket Club }}</ref>

Another reason cricket's decline in popularity may be that in the late 1800s American cricket remained an amateur sport reserved for the wealthy while England and Australia were developing a [[professional sport|professional]] version of the game. As cricket standards improved with professionalism elsewhere in the world many North American cricket clubs stayed stubbornly elitist. Clubs such as [[Philadelphia Cricket Club|Philadelphia]] and [[Merion Cricket Club|Merion]] abandoned cricket and converted their facilities to other sports. Some city cricket clubs unknowingly contributed to their own demise by sponsoring auxiliary baseball teams.{{Fact|date=March 2007}} By 1900 baseball had taken over the American scene and created its independent mythology.{{Fact|date=March 2007}} The formation of the ''Imperial Cricket Conference'' in 1909 also helped to keep the popularity of the game down. It certainly undercut any momentum to professionalize cricket in the USA, although whether the momentum would have developed even in the presence of a more open ICC remains a question.<ref name='CricInfoArticle'> {{cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/usa/content/story/141158.html |title=Cricinfo - Cricket in the USA |last=Das |first=Deb |accessdate=2007-03-09 |date=None Given |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] }}</ref> Regardless of its cause, the game did not flourish in the United States the way it did in the [[British Empire]]. From the 1880s until the outbreak of [[World War I]], the American game was dominated not by the national side, but by an amateur team from [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].

===Philadelphian cricket===

{{main|Philadelphian cricket team}}[[Image:Philadelphians in 1884.JPG|right|thumb|The [[Philadelphian cricket team]], shown here on an 1884 tour of England, were the premier American cricket team for several decades after the US Civil War]]
The Philadelphian cricket team was a team that represented [[Philadelphia]] in [[first-class cricket]] between 1878 and 1913. Even though the United States had played the first ever international [[cricket]] match against [[Canada cricket team|Canada]] in 1844, the sport began a slow decline in the country.<ref name='CricinfoArticle'> {{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/143914.html |title=Cricinfo - Pennsylvania's hidden secret |last=Das |first=Deb |accessdate=2007-02-14 |date=[[7 April]] [[2005]] |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] }}</ref> This decline was furthered by the rise in popularity of baseball. In Philadelphia, however, the sport remained very popular and from the end of the 19th century until the outbreak of [[World War I]], the city produced a first class team that rivaled many others in the world. The team was composed of players from the four chief cricket clubs in Philadelphia&ndash;[[Germantown Cricket Club|Germantown]], [[Merion Cricket Club|Merion]], [[Belmont Cricket Club|Belmont]], and [[Philadelphia Cricket Club|Philadelphia]]. Players from smaller clubs, such as [[Tioga Cricket Club|Tioga]] and [[Moorestown Cricket Club|Moorestown]], and local colleges, such as [[Haverford College|Haverford]] and [[University of Pennsylvania|Penn]], also played for the Philadelphians. Over its 35 years, the team played in 89 first-class cricket matches. Of those, 29 were won, 46 were lost, 13 were drawn and one game was abandoned before completion.<ref>See summary of first-class matches [[Philadelphian cricket team#Summary of first-class matches|here]].</ref>

Arguably, the greatest American cricketer ever played for Philadelphia during this period. [[John Barton King]] was a very skilled batsman, but really proved his worth as a bowler. During his career, he set numerous records in North America and at least one [[first-class cricket|first-class]] bowling record.<ref name='Rolfe'>{{cite book | last = Rolfe | first = John |title=Everything You Want to Know About Sports (Sports Illustrated for Kids) |publisher=Bantam Books for Young Readers |location=New York |year=1994 |isbn=0-553-48166-5 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref> He competed with and succeeded against the best cricketers in the world from England and Australia. King was the dominant bowler on his team when it toured England in 1897, 1903, and 1908. He dismissed batsmen with his unique delivery, which he called "the angler", and helped to perfect swing bowling in the sport. Many of the great bowlers of today still use the strategies and techniques that he developed.<ref name='SABRUK'> {{cite web|url=http://www.sabruk.org/examiner/10/cricket.html |title=SABR UK Examiner no.10: Baseball and Cricket: Cross-Currents |accessdate=2007-01-31 |last=Synge |first=Allen |date=2007 |publisher=[[Society for American Baseball Research]] (UK Chapter) }}</ref> [[Plum Warner|Sir Pelham Warner]] described Bart King as one of the finest bowlers of all time,<ref name='WisObit'> {{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/234625.html |title=Wisden - 1966 - Obituaries in 1965 |accessdate=2007-01-31 |date=1966 |publisher=[[Wisden|John Wisden & Co]] }}</ref> and [[Donald Bradman]] called him "America's greatest cricketing son."<ref name='TheDon'>{{cite book | last = Bradman | first = Donald | authorlink = | title = The Art of Cricket | publisher = Robson Books | date = 1998 | pages = | doi = | isbn = }}</ref>

On [[28 June]] [[1913]] the Philadelphians played the last first-class game on the mainland for more than 90 years. Games were played in the [[US Virgin Islands]] in the interim, which is considered as part of the West Indies by the ICC. The team had played an American national side 6 times between 1885 and 1894. The United States team won one of these matches, lost two, and earned a draw in three. Cricket remained a minor pastime in the United States until the mid-1960s, when ICC reforms allowed associate members to join.

===Status from 1965===

In 1965, the Imperial Cricket Conference changed its name to the International Cricket Conference. In addition, new rules were adopted to permit the election of countries from outside the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. This led to the expansion of the Conference, with the admission of Associate Members, including the United States. Today cricket is played in all fifty states.<ref>[http://www.usaca.org/Who_we_are.htm USACA Who we are page]</ref>

The USA have played in every edition of the [[ICC Trophy]], though they didn't pass the first round until the [[1990 ICC Trophy|1990 tournament]] in the [[Netherlands]]. They reached the plate final of the [[1994 ICC Trophy|1994 tournament]], but opted not to play due to prior travel arrangements. They finished twelfth in [[1997 ICC Trophy|1997]] and sixth in [[2001 ICC Trophy|2001]], their best performance to date. They have also played in every edition of the [[ICC Americas Championship]], winning in 2002.<ref name="TL">[http://www.cricketeurope4.net/CRICKETEUROPE/GENERAL/TIMELINES/usa.shtml Timeline of USA cricket] at CricketEurope</ref>

In 2004, the United States cricket team played a first-class match as part of the first [[ICC Intercontinental Cup]]. The matches against [[Canadian cricket team|Canada]] and [[Bermuda national cricket team|Bermuda]] were the first in many years.<ref name="TL" /> The team won the [[ICC 6 Nations Challenge]] beating [[Scotland national cricket team|Scotland]], [[Namibia national cricket team|Namibia]], the [[Netherlands national cricket team|Netherlands]], and the [[United Arab Emirates national cricket team|UAE]] on net run rate by 0.028 of a run.<ref>[http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Events/Tables/ICC_Six_Nations_Challenge_2003-04.html ICC 6 Nations Challenge 2004 Points Table at Cricket Archive]</ref>

Winning the ICC Six Nations meant that they qualified for the [[ICC Champions Trophy 2004]] in England. Here the USA played their first ever [[One Day International]] match against [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] at [[The Oval]] on [[10 September]] [[2004]].<ref name="ODIs">[http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Records/UnitedStatesofAmerica/Odis/Odi_List.html List of ODIs played by the USA]</ref> The US side was beaten by New Zealand and lost to [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] in the tournament, as well.<ref name="CT04">[http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Events/Tables/ICC_Champions_Trophy_2004.html Points Table from the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy at Cricket Archive]</ref>

The [[2005 ICC Trophy]] represented a chance for the USA to re-establish themselves on the world stage and qualify for the [[2007 cricket World Cup|2007 World Cup]]. A poor showing saw them finish at the bottom of their group, with four losses and a match abandoned due to rain from their five group fixtures. This failure robbed the USA of the prize of full [[One Day International]] status on offer to the World Cup qualifiers.<ref name="TL" /> This failure was compounded on [[August 9]] [[2005]] when the ICC expelled the USA from the [[2005 ICC Intercontinental Cup]].<ref name="Susp">[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/usa/content/story/215409.html ICC suspends USA from Intercontinental Cup, Cricinfo]</ref>

The USA made their return to international cricket in August 2006 when they participated in Division One of the [[ICC Americas Championship]] in [[Canada]].<ref name="AC106">[http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Seasons/CAN/2006_CAN_ICC_World_Cricket_League_Americas_Region_Division_One_2006.html Americas Division One at Cricket Archive]</ref> They finished second in the five team tournament.<ref>[http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Events/Tables/ICC_World_Cricket_League_Americas_Region_Division_One_2006.html Americas Division One points table]</ref>

In May 2007 the USA were to visit [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], [[Australia]] to take part in [[2007 ICC World Cricket League Division Three|Division Three]] of the [[ICC World Cricket League]].<ref name="WCL Structure">[http://www.icc-cricket.com/icc/development/wcl_div1-5_2007-2009.pdf World Cricket League Structure]</ref> A top two finish in this tournament would have qualified them for [[2007 ICC World Cricket League Division Two|Division Two]] of the same tournament later in the year.<ref name="WCL Structure">[http://www.icc-cricket.com/icc/development/wcl_div1-5_2007-2009.pdf World Cricket League Structure]</ref> Unfortunately, the [[United States of America Cricket Association]] was suspended from the ICC and the team was pulled from this competition.<ref name="Susp2">[http://content-www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/282227.html Cricinfo - ICC suspends USA Cricket Association<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The suspension was due to an internal dispute over a constitution for the USACA. The dispute was resolved in early 2008, and the suspension was lifted on April 1 of that year.

The team's reinstatement permitted them to enter the [[World Cricket League]] in [[2008 ICC World Cricket League Division Five|Division Five]] for 2008 in [[Jersey]].  The team made it through the Group Stage tied for first in their division with a 4-0-0 record (one match abandoned),<ref>[http://www.cricketeurope4.net/WCL5/DATABASE/RESULTS/tables.shtml Points tables] at WCL5 Official site</ref> but lost both their semi-final match with Jersey and their third-place play-off with Nepal.<ref name="WCL508">[http://www.cricketeurope4.net/WCL5/DATABASE/RESULTS/index.shtml Results] at WCL5 Official site</ref> They will play in Division Five again in 2010.<ref name="Exp">[http://www.cricketeurope4.net/DATABASE/ARTICLES2/articles/000034/003452.shtml World Cricket League to continue and expand] by Andrew Nixon, 25 May 2008 at CricketEurope</ref>
