The S.S. Foundation Franklin was a sea-going [[salvage]] vessel operated by [[Foundation Maritime]] between [[1930]]-[[1949]]. The ship was  built for the [[British Navy]] in [[1918]].


== History ==


The Foundation Franklin was built HMS Frisky in [[Dundee]], [[Scotland]], in 1918. She was designed to move capitol warships, and operate in rough weather. 
The ship was commisioned in the spring of [[1919]], but the ending of  [[WWI]] ended the need for the HMS Frisky. She was used to tow warships to [[Scapa Flow]] until being laid up. In 1924, the ship was sold and performed towing work on the [[Rhine River]] and in the [[Baltic Sea]]. The Frisky was later purchased by a German project intending to tow barges across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and renamed S.S. Gustavo Ipland, but the project was destined to fall through. The former HMS Frisky then was laid up until 1930.

The ship was purchased by a [[Foundation Maritime]] representative in 1930, and brought to Southampton the same year. After a complete refurbishing, the ship was sailed to Foundation Maritime headquarters in [[Montreal]], [[Canada]]. She continued to operate in the [[salvage]] role until [[1948]], when a storm damaged the ship beyond repair. She was sold for scrap the following year.
