In [[linguistics]], '''Polonization''' refers to conversion of a foreign word or name to a form better following [[Polish language|Polish]] phonetic and syntactical rules.  Compare with [[Romanization]].

In [[history]], depending on the context, the phenomenon of Polonization can be understood in two different ways.

<!---now chronological order--->On the one hand, Polonization can be seen as an example of [[cultural assimilation]]. Such view is widely considered applicable to the times of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] (1569-1795) when the [[Ruthenia]]n and [[Lithuania]]n [[upper class]]es were drawn towards the more [[Western culture|Westernized]] Polish culture, political and financial benefits of such transition, as well as, sometimes, by the administrative pressure exerted on their own cultural institutions, primarily the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]]. The conversion to the [[Roman Catholic]] faith (and to a lesser extent, [[Protestant]]) was often the single most important part of the process as for Ruthenians of that time being Polish culturally and Roman Catholic by religion was almost the same. This aspect of Polonization that led to the diminishing of the Orthodox Church was most resented by Belarusian and Ukrainian masses. In contrast the Lithuanians, who were mostly Catholic, were in danger of losing their cultural identity as a nation, but that didn't become evident for the wide masses of Lithuanians until the [[History of Lithuania#Lithuanian national revival|Lithuanian national renaissance]] in the middle of the [[19th century]].

On the other hand, the Polonization policies of the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish government]] in the [[interbellum|interwar years]] of the twentieth century were again two-folded. Some of them were similar to the mostly forcible [[assimilation (sociology)|assimilationist]] policies, implemented by other European powers that have aspired to regional dominance (e.g., [[Germanization]], [[Russification]]), while others resembled policies carried out by countries aiming at increasing the role of their native language and culture in their own societies (e.g., [[Rumanization]], [[Ukrainization]]). For Poles, it was a process of rebuilding the Polish national identity and reclaiming Polish heritage, including the fields of education, religion, infrastructure and administration, that suffered under the prolonged periods of [[partitions of Poland|foreign occupation by the neighboring empires]] of [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[Prussia]], and [[Austria-Hungary]]. However, as a third of recreated Poland's population was ethnically non-Polish and many felt their own nationhood aspirations thwarted specifically by Poland, large segments of this population resisted to varying extent policies aimed to assimilate them into Polish culture. [[Endecja|Part of the country's leadership]] emphasized the need for the ethnic and cultural homogeneity of the state in the long term. However, the governmental advancement of [[Polish language]] in the administration, the public life and, especially, the education (combined with discriminating against other languages) were perceived by some as an attempt at forcible homogenization.  In areas inhabited by ethnic Ukrainians for example, actions of the Polish authorities seen as aiming at restricting the influence of the Orthodox and the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] caused additional resentment, and were considered to be closely tied to religious Polonization, as most ethnic Poles were Catholics. 

The proponents of the Polonization policies implemented in areas where ethnic Poles were a minority hoped that they would result in the Polish language becoming dominant over the continuum of a few generations. However, given the relatively short duration of [[Second Polish Republic|the Republic]]'s independence of less than twenty years, these policies, applied with varying intensity by successive Polish governments, fell far short of their aim, thus contributing to increased ethnic tensions which led to large scale interethnic violence during [[World War II]].

==Historic periods==
===Piast Poland===
Between the [[12th century|12th]] and the [[14th century|14th]] centuries many towns in Poland adopted the so-called [[Magdeburg rights]] that promoted the towns' development and [[trade (profession)|trade]]. The rights were usually granted by the king on the occasion of the arrival of migrants. Some, integrated with the larger community, such as merchants who settled there, especially [[Greeks]] and [[Armenians]]. They adopted most aspects of Polish culture but kept their Orthodox faith. Since the Middle Ages, Polish culture, influenced by the West, in turn radiated East, beginning the long and uneasy process of [[cultural assimilation]].<ref name="Mikos">[[Michael J.

===Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth===
In the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], the non-Polish [[ethnic group]]s, especially the [[Ruthenian]]s and [[Lithuanians]], found themselves under the strong pressure of [[Polish culture]].<ref name=Polonska1>[[Nataliia Polonska-Vasylenko]], History of Ukraine, "Lybid", (1993), ISBN 5325004255, v.I, Section: "Ukraine under Poland"</ref><ref name=Iakovenko1>Natalia Iakovenko, Narys istorii Ukrainy s zaidavnishyh chasic do kincia XVIII stolittia, Kiev, 1997, Section: 'Ukraine-Rus, the "odd man out" in Rzeczpospolita Obojga Narodow''</ref>

''"Within the [Lithuanian] grand duchy, the Ruthenian lands initially retained considerable autonomy. The pagan Lithuanians themselves were increasingly converting to Orthodoxy and assimilating into Ruthenian culture. The grand duchy's administrative practices and legal system drew heavily on Slavic customs, and Ruthenian became the official state language. Direct Polish rule in Ukraine since the 1340s and for two centuries thereafter was limited to Galicia. There, changes in such areas as administration, law, and land tenure proceeded more rapidly than in Ukrainian territories under Lithuania. However, Lithuania itself was soon drawn into the orbit of Poland."''

This was reflected in a sizeable polemical literature, struggles over the control of bishoprics and church properties that intensified after the restoration of an Orthodox hierarchy in 1620, and numerous acts of violence. Efforts to heal the breach in the 1620s and '30s were ultimately fruitless."''

and even an attempted ban<ref name="EB_Unia">
In 1596 the Union of Brest-Litovsk subordinated the Eastern Orthodox church of the Commonwealth to the papacy by creating the Eastern-rite (Uniate) church. Politically, this was intended to cement the cohesion of the state vis-à-vis Moscow; instead it led to internal divisions among the Orthodox. The new Eastern-rite church became a hierarchy without followers while the forbidden Eastern Orthodox church was driven underground. Wladyslaw's recognition of the latter's existence in 1632 May have come too late. The Orthodox masses—deprived of their native protectors, who had become Polonized and Catholic—turned to the Cossacks.

The Lithuanian Grand Duke [[Jogaila]] was offered the Polish crown and became [[Jogaila|Władysław II Jagiełło]] (reigned 1386-1434). This marked the beginning of the gradual Polonization of the Lithuanian nobility. He built many Roman Catholic churches in pagan [[Lithuanians]] land and provided them generously with estates, gave out the lands and positions to the Catholics, settled the cities and villages and gave most the biggest cities and towns the [[Magdeburg Rights]] privileges that consisted of many allowances. These rights were given only to the settlements dominated by the Poles and the Germans but not to Ruthenian settlements whose residents were fully taxed{{dubious}}. The noble Ruthenians were also freed from many payment obligations and their rights were equalized with those of the Polish nobility but only when they adopted the Catholicism. Then they were provided with compensation for the military service, while those who remained Orthodox received none. As such, the entire population of Ruthenia was split into the privileged and non-privileged ones, and the latter were the Orthodox people of Ruthenia.<ref name=Polonska1/>

Under Jagiełło's successor [[Władysław III of Poland|Władysław III of Varna]] (reigned 1434-1444) the Polonization which earlier took place more by force than by other means<ref name=KostWladJagello>
''"The new Polish king, the son of Jagello, Vladislav [Wladyslaw] named in history "of Varna" due to his death in the battle with Turks at Varna in 1444) curbed significantly the aspirations of Svidrigello [Švitrigaila] by his attitude to the Ruthenian people and the Ruthenian religion. Until that day [under Jagiello] the Poles captured power in Ruthenia by force [...] . Jagiello's successor, Wladyslaw (reigned from 1434), acted differently than his father, although with the same goals in mind. He expanded the privileges and liberties formerly available only to the Ruthenian nobles of the Latin religion to all Ruthenian nobles without exception. This marked the beginning of the reconciliation between Ruthenia and Poland..."''
</ref> attained a certain degree of subtlety. Władysław III introduced some more liberal reforms. He expanded the privileges to all Ruthenian nobles, irrespective of their religion, and in 1443 he signed a bull equalizing the Orthodox church in rights with the Roman Catholicism thus alleviating the relationship with the Orthodox clergy. These policies continued under the next king [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]]. Still, the mostly cultural expansion of the Polish influence continued since the Ruthenian nobility were attracted by both the glamour of the Western culture and the Polish political order where the [[magnates]] became the unrestricted rulers of the lands and serfs in their vast estates. 

Some Ruthenian magnates like [[Sanguszko]], [[Wiśniowiecki]] and [[Kisiel]], resisted the cultural Polonization for several generations, with the [[Ostrogski]] family being one of the most prominent examples. Remaining generally loyal to the Polish state, the magnates, like Ostrogskis, stood by the religion of their forefathers, and supported the Orthodox Church generously by opening schools, printing books in Ruthenian language (the first four printed [[Cyrillic]] books in the world were published in Cracow, in 1491<ref name="Mikos">[[Michael J. Mikoś]], ''Polish Renaissance Literature: An Anthology''. Ed. Michael J. Mikoś. Columbus, Ohio/Bloomington, Indiana: Slavica Publishers. 1995. ISBN 0-89357-257-8, [http://staropolska.gimnazjum.com.pl/ang/renaissance/Mikos_renaissance/Literary_r.html RENAISSANCE LITERARY BACKGROUND]</ref>) and giving generously to the Orthodox churches' construction. However, their resistance was gradually waning with each subsequent generation as more and more of the Ruthenian elite turned towards Polish language and Catholicism.

Still, with most of the educational system getting Polonized and the most generously funded institutions being to the west of Ruthenia, the Ruthenian indigenous culture further deteriorated. In the Polish Ruthenia the language of the administrative paperwork started to gradually shift towards Polish. By the 16th century the language of administrative paperwork in Ruthenia was a peculiar mix of the older [[Church Slavonic]] with the [[Ruthenian language]] of the commoners and the [[Polish language]]. With the Polish influence in the mix gradually increasing it soon became mostly like the Polish language superimposed on the Ruthenian phonetics. The total confluence of Ruthenia and Poland was seen coming.<ref name=KostOstGen>Kostomarov, ''"Ostrozhski"''</ref>

As the [[Eastern Rite Catholic Churches|Eastern Rite]] [[Greek-Catholic]] Church originally created to accommodate the Ruthenian, initially Orthodox, nobility, ended up unnecessary to them as they converted directly into the [[Latin Rite]] Catholicism en masse, the Church largely became an hierarchy without followers. The Greek Catholic Church was then used as a tool aimed to split even the peasantry from their Ruthenian roots, still mostly unsuccessfully.<ref name="EB_Unia"/> The commoners, deprived of their native protectors, sought protection through the [[Cossacks]],<Ref name="EB_Unia"/> who, being fiercely Orthodox, tended also to easily turn to violence against those they perceived as their enemies, particularly the Polish state and what they saw as its representatives, the Poles and generally the [[Catholic]]s , as well as the Jews.<ref name=KostKhmeln>{{Ru icon}} "''Little Russian Hetman Zinoviy-Bogdan Khmelnytsky''" ([[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]]) in "[[Nikolay Kostomarov]]'s, "Russian History in Biographies of its main figures", [http://www.kulichki.com/inkwell/text/special/history/kostom/kostom36.htm]</ref>

The Polonization took place in the early years of the [[Prussia]]n partition, where as a reaction to the persecution of Roman Catholicism during the [[Kulturkampf]], German Catholics living in areas with a Polish majority voluntarily integrated themselves within Polish society, affecting approximately 100,000 Germans in the eastern provinces of Prussia.<ref name="Thomas"/>

According to some scholars the biggest successes in Polonisation of the non-Polish lands of former Commonwealth were achieved after the Partitions, in times of persecution of Polishness (noted by [[Leon Wasilewski]] (1917<ref>Wasilewski L. (Wasilewski 1917) Kresy Wschodnie. — Warszawa: T-wo wydawnicze w Warszawie, 1917. p. VII as cited in (Smalyanchuk 2001), p.24.</ref>), [[Mitrofan Dovnar-Zapolsky]] (1926<ref>(Dovnar 1926) pp.290—291,298.</ref>)). Paradoxically, the substantial eastward movement of the Polish ethnic territory (over these lands) and growth of the Polish ethnic regions were taking place exactly in the period of the strongest Russian attack on everything Polish in Lithuania and Belarus.<ref>"In times of Myravyov the Hanger", as noted in (Wasilewski 1917), p. VII as cited in (Smalyanchuk 2001), p.24. See also the note on treatment of Polonisation as self-Polonisation.</ref>

Following the [[Partitions of Poland|demise of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in the end of the eighteenth century, the Polonization trends initially continued in Lithuania, Belarus and Polish-dominated parts of Ukraine as the initially liberal policies of the Empire gave the Polish elite significant concessions in the local affairs. Dovnar-Zapolsky notes<ref name="Dovnar"> Довнар-Запольский М. В. ([[Mitrofan Dovnar-Zapolsky]]) История Белоруссии. — 2-е изд. — Мн.: Беларусь, 2005. — 680 с.

With time, the traditional [[Latin]] was fully eliminated from the University and by 1816 it was fully replaced by Polish and Russian. This change both affected and reflected a profound change in the Belarusian and Lithuanian secondary schools systems where Latin was also traditionally used as the University was the main source of the teachers for these schools. Additionally, the University was responsible for the textbooks selection and only Polish textbooks were approved for printing and usage.<ref name=Yla/>

Dovnar-Zapolsky notes that "the 1800s – 1810s had seen the unprecedented prosperity of the Polish culture and language in the former Great Duchy of Lithuania lands" and "this era has seen the effective completion of the Polonization of the smallest nobility, with further reduction of the areal of use of the contemporary [[Belarusian language]].<ref name=Dovnar290>Dovnar-Zapolsky, pp.290-298.</ref> also noting that the Polonization trend had been complemented with the (covert) anti-Russian and anti-Orthodox trends.<ref name="Dovnar_p293">Dovnar-Zapolsky, pp.293—296.</ref> The Lithuanian opposition to these development was quieted by various, sometimes even violent means.<ref name=Yla/> The results of these trends are best reflected in the [[Ethnic history of the region of Vilnius|ethnic censuses]] in previously non-Polish territories.

The trends continued with the [[French invasion of Russia (1812)|arrival of Napoleon in 1812]]. The Poles continued to occupy the most important positions in the Vilnius government of Lithuania and following the restoration of the Russian rule the central government policies changed little. [[Jan Śniadecki]], who was promoted under Napoleon times to the rank of the Minister of Education and Cults retained his rectorship due to the Czartoryski's protection. As Alexander's plan to break Lithuania away from Poland through the restoration of the Grand Duchy became apparent, Sniadecki, supported by Czartoryski, who pretended to be faithful to Tzar, made the last ditch effort to Polonize the young generation of Lithuanians by educating them as Poles that would join the ranks of the strugle for the independent and homogeneous Poland.<ref name=Yla/>

Following the Polish [[November Uprising]] aimed at breaking away from Russia, the Imperial policies changed abruptly. The University was forcibly closed in 1832 and the following years where characterized by the policies aimed at the assimilationist solution of the "Polish question", the trend that was further strengthen following another unsuccessful [[January Uprising]] (1863).{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

In the 19th century, the mostly unchallenged Polonization trend of the previous centuries had been met staunchly by then "[[anti-Polish]]" [[Russification]] policy, with temporary successes on both sides, like Polonization rises in mid-1850s and in 1880s and Russification strengthenings in 1830s and in 1860s.<ref name="Dovnar_p303">Dovnar-Zapolsky, pp.303—315,319—320,328—331.</ref> Any Polonization of the east and west territories (Russian and German partitions) occurred in the situation were Poles had steadily diminishing influence on the government. Partition of Poland posed a genuine threat to the continuation of Polish language-culture in those regions.<ref name="Suss_Cubb"/> As Polonization was centered around Polish culture, policies aimed at weakening and destroying it had a significant impact on weakening Polonization of those regions.

According to the Polish Census of 1931, Poles made up 5,600,000 of the total population of eastern Poland which stood at 13,021,000.* In Lithuania, Poles had majorities in the Vilnius [P. Wilno, Rus. Vilna] and Suwałki areas, as well as significant numbers in and around Kaunas [P.Kowno]."</ref> Following the post-[[World War I]] rebirth of the Polish statehood, these lands became again disputed but the Poles, who were more successful than the nascent [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]] in the [[Polish-Ukrainian War]] of 1918.

The Ukrainian territories of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] and [[Volhynia]] had different backgrounds, different late histories and different dominant religions. Until the First World War, Galicia with its largely [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Greek Catholic]] Ukrainian population, was controlled by the [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian Empire]] whose local policies were relatively pro-Ukrainian (Ruthenian) in an attempt to cement the Austrian control over the territories and prevent the political trends of population's leaning towards the rest of Ukrainians controlled by the [[Russian Empire]]. Such policies resulted in much stronger national self-perception among the Galicia Ukrainians. On the other hand, the Ukrainians of Volhynia, formerly of the [[Russian Empire]], were largely [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox by religion]], and were influenced by strong [[Ukrainian Russophiles |Russophile]] trends. Therefore, while the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] (UGCC), which functions in [[Full communion|communion]] with the [[Latin Rite]] Catholicism, could have hoped to receive a better treatment in Poland, where the leadership saw the Catholicism as one of the main tools to unify the nation, the Poles saw the Greek Catholic Galicia Ukrainians as even less reliable than the Orthodox Volhynia Ukrainians seen as good candidates for the political assimilation. As such the Polish policy in Ukraine initially was aimed at keeping Greek Catholic Galicians from influencing Orthodox Volhynians.<ref name="Snyder">[[Timothy Snyder]], ''The Reconstruction of Nations: Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania, Belarus, 1569-1999'', Yale University Press, ISBN 0-300-10586-X[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN030010586X&id=xSpEynLxJ1MC&pg=PA144&lpg=PA144&dq=stanislaw+grabski&sig=5kSKOnXipwsTitk7w_hotRTooPQ Google Books, p.144]</ref> 

Due to the region's history the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] attained a strong Ukrainian national character, and the Polish authorities sought to weaken it in various ways. In 1924, following a visit with the Ukrainian Catholic believers in North America and western Europe, the head of the UGCC was initially denied reentry to Lviv until after a considerable delay. Polish priests led by their bishops began to undertake missionary work among Eastern Rite faithful, and the administrative restrictions were placed on the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church.<ref name=Magosci>{{cite book| author=Magosci, P. | title=Morality and Reality: the Life and Times of Andrei Sheptytsky| location= Edmonton, Alberta | publisher= Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies, University of Alberta | year = 1989| }}</ref> 

With respect to the Orthodox Ukrainian population in eastern Poland, the [[Polish government]] initially issued a decree defending the rights of the Orthodox minorities. In practice, this often failed, as the [[Catholics]], also eager to strengthen their position, had official representation in the [[Sejm]] and the courts. Any accusation was strong enough for a particular church to be confiscated and handed over to the Roman Catholic church. 190 Orthodox churches were destroyed (some of the destroyed churches were abandoned<ref name="BP">''The Impact of External Threat on States and Domestic Societie'', [[Manus I.

How to deal with the non-Polish minorities was a subject of intense debate within the Polish leadership. Two ideas of Polish policy clashed at the time - a more tolerant and arguably less assimilationist approach advocated by [[Józef Piłsudski]],<ref name="Brzez">[[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] in his introduction to Wacław Jędrzejewicz’s “Pilsudski A Life For Poland” wrote: ''Pilsudski’s vision of Poland, paradoxically, was never attained. He contributed immensely to the creation of a modern Polish state, to the preservation of Poland from the Soviet invasion, yet he failed to create <u>the kind of multinational commonwealth, based on principles of social justice and ethnic tolerance, to which he aspired in his youth</u>. One may wonder how relevant was his image of such a Poland in the age of nationalism...''. Quoted from [http://members.lycos.co.uk/jozefpilsudski/index2.html this website].</ref> whose project of creating a [[Międzymorze]] [[federation]] with other states failed in the [[aftermath of the Polish-Soviet War]], clashed with the eventually prevailing assimilationist approach advocated by [[Roman Dmowski]] (minister of foreign affairs) and [[Stanisław Grabski]] (minister of religion and education). Dmowski and Grabski saw the solution of the "minorities problem" in imposing  "Polish values" (Polish language and the Catholic Church) on the minorities to achieve "national assimilation", i.e. to make them "Polish" within the "next generation".<ref name="Snyder"/> On the other hand, [[Józef Piłsudski]], a Polish [[chief of State]] who also controlled the army, supported "state" rather than "national" assimilation as a more practical approach. 

As most of the Polish government was initially controlled by [[Roman Dmowski]], [[National Democracy|National Democratic]] leader and a strong proponent of Polonization,<ref name="BFG">[[Manfred F.

When the territories of [[Western Belarus]], [[Western Ukraine]] and the [[Wilno Voivodship|Wilno region]] were incorporated into Poland after the [[Treaty of Riga]], Poland rejected its international obligations to grant autonomy to [[eastern Galicia]]{{ref|Stakhiv}}, which she had never intended to honor.<ref name=Roshwald_p. 144./> Linguistic assimilation was considered by [[National Democracy|National Democrats]] to be a major factor for "unifying the state." For example, [[Stanisław Grabski]], Polish Minister for Religion and Public Education in 1923 and 1925-1926, wrote that "Poland may be preserved only as a state of Polish people. If it were a state of Poles, Jews, Germans, Rusyns, Belarusians, Lithuanians, Russians, it would lose its independence again"; and that "it is impossible to make a nation out of those who have no 'national self-identification,' who call themselves 'local' (''[[tutejszy]]'')."{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. Grabski also said that the aim of Polish policy should be "the transformation of the Commonwealth into Polish ethnic territory."<ref name="Reid">[[Anna Reid]], ''Borderland: A Journey Through the History of Ukraine'', Westview Press, 2000, ISBN 0-8133-3792-5, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0813337925&id=f78MPIkGDFMC&pg=PA106&lpg=PA106&dq=stanislaw+grabski&sig=SjXf-H9DAr-0pTJmPwP_ckLe1VM Google Print, p.106]</ref><ref name="Brub">[[Rogers Brubaker]], ''Nationalism Reframed: Nationhood and the National Question in the New Europe'', Cambridge University Press, 1996, ISBN 0-521-57649-0, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0521576490&id=O3Bfhfghi50C&pg=PA100&lpg=PA100&dq=stanislaw+grabski&sig=pVgdkDsk1AeiVqF-Rl8QhQ_Pddw Google Print, p.100]</ref> Some officials denied the existence of the Ukrainian and Belarusian nations altogether{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.

A law issued in 1924 banned usage of any language but [[Polish language|Polish]] in governmental and municipal paperwork{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. It the area of public education it was postulated that state schools could be only Polish language schools.<ref name="Snyder"/> Local populations could have private local language schools, but only in territories "loyal to the Polish state"{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. Specifically with respect to the Eastern territories (known as ''[[Kresy Wschodnie]]'', or "Eastern Borderlands") it was recognized that ''"schools can become an instrument of the cultural development in Eastern lands only if Polish teachers will work there"''{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. It turned out to be infeasible for implementation and, in particular cases, bilingual schools ("[[utraquist school]]s", ''szkoły utrakwistyczne'') were proposed, while in reality those schools were functionally the Polish language ones.<ref name="Snyder"/> 

In internal politics, Piłsudski's reign marked a much-needed stabilization and improvement in the situation of [[ethnic minorities]], which formed almost a third of the population of the Second Republic. Piłsudski replaced the [[National Democracy|National-Democratic]] "ethnic-assimilation" with a "state-assimilation" policy: citizens were judged by their loyalty to the state, not by their nationality.<ref name="Snyder"/> The years 1926-1935 were favourably viewed by many [[Polish Jews]], whose situation improved especially under the cabinet of Piłsudski’s appointee [[Kazimierz Bartel]].<ref name="Cieplinski">[[Feigue Cieplinski]], ''Poles and Jews: The Quest For Self-Determination 1919-1934'', Binghamton Journal of History, Fall 2002, Last accessed on 2 June, 2006.</ref> However a combination of various reasons, from the [[Great Depression]],<ref name="Snyder"/> through the Pisłudski's need for support from parties for the parliament's election<ref name="Snyder"/> to the [[vicious spiral]] of terrorist attacks by [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]] and government pacifications<ref name="Davies_GP2-407">Davies, God's Playground, op.cit., [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0231053525&id=DMoPXktGwiUC&pg=PA407&lpg=PA407&dq=Davies+OUN+terrorism&sig=n2yftCtdccp3U4rPQL8OcBtH9_8]</ref><ref name="Snyder"/> meant that the situation continued to degenerate, despite Piłsudski's efforts. The attitude of Ukrainians of that time is well shown in the statements by the reputable Ukrainian historian [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]], who noted negative influence of Polish policies on the [[Ukrainian culture]]: "the four centuries of Polish rule had left particularly destructive effects (...) economic and cultural backwardness in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] was the main "legacy of historical Poland, which assiduously skimmed everything that could be considered the cream of the nation, leaving it in a state of oppression and helplessness".<ref>C.

After the [[Polish legislative election, 1930]], Belarusian representation in the [[Polish parliament]] was reduced and since the early 1930s the Polish government started to introduce policies intended to Polonize the minorities{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. In [[1938]] about 100 abandoned<ref name="BP"/>Orthodox churches were destroyed or converted to [[Roman Catholic]] in the eastern parts of Poland.<ref name="mironowicz">[[Eugeniusz Mironowicz]], ''"Białoruś"'', Trio, Warszawa, 1999, ISBN 83-85660-82-8, p. 109</ref> The use of [[Belarusian language]] was discouraged. There wasn't a Belarusian school  in the spring of [[1939]], and only 44 schools teaching Belarusian language existed in Poland at the beginning of [[World War II]]{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.

Situation of Lithuanians also was getting worse. During the interwar period of the 20th century (1920-1939) [[Lithuanian-Polish relations]] were characterised by mutual enmity. Starting with the conflict over the city of [[Vilnius]] (Wilno), and the [[Polish-Lithuanian War]] shortly after the [[First World War]], both governments - in the era nationalism was sweeping through Europe - treated their respective minorities harshly.<ref name="Żołędowski114">Żołędowski, ''Białorusini i Litwini...'', p. 114</ref> <ref name="Makowski244">Makowski, ''Litwini...'', pp.244-303</ref> <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/ethnic/Random%20Narratives/LithuaniaRN1.3.pdf |title=Lithuania|accessdate=2007-06-18 |last= Fearon |first=James D. |coauthors=Laitin, David D. |year= 2006 |format=pdf |publisher= Stanford University |pages=4 |language= English}}</ref>  Beginning 1920, after the staged mutiny of [[Lucjan Żeligowski]] Lithuanian cultural activities in Polish controlled territories were limited; closure of newspapers and arrest of editors occurred.<ref name="Čepėnas">{{cite book |last=Čepėnas |first=Pranas |authorlink=Pranas Čepėnas | title=Naujųjų laikų Lietuvos istorija |year=1986 |publisher=Dr. Griniaus fondas |location=Chicago |pages= p.655,656}}</ref> One of them - [[Mykolas Biržiška]] was accused of state treason and sentenced to a [[death penalty]], only direct intervention by the [[League of Nations]] saved him from this fate. He was one of 32 Lithuanian and Belarussian cultural activists formally expelled from Vilnius on September 20, 1922 and turned over to Lithuanian army.<ref name="Čepėnas"/> In 1927, as tensions between Lithuania and Poland arose furthermore 48 Lithuanian schools were closed and another 11 Lithuanian activist were deported. <ref name="Żołędowski114">Żołędowski, Cezary (2003). ''Białorusini i Litwini w Polsce, Polacy na Białorusi i Litwie (in Polish). Warszawa: ASPRA-JR. ISBN 8388766767'' p. 114</ref> Following [[Józef Piłsudski|Piłsudski's]] death in 1935, [[Lithuanian minority in Poland]] again became an object of [[Polonisation]] policies, more intensive this time. 266 Lithuanian schools were closed since 1936 and almost all organizations were banned. Further Polonisation was ensued as the government encouraged [[Osadnik|settlement of Polish army veterans]] in disputed regions. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/ethnic/Random%20Narratives/LithuaniaRN1.3.pdf |title=Lithuania|accessdate=2007-06-18 |last= Fearon |first=James D. | coauthors=Laitin, David D.  |year= 2006 |format=pdf  |publisher= Stanford University |pages=4 |language= English}}</ref>
About 400 Lithuanian reading rooms and libraries were closed in Poland in 1936-1938. <ref name="Makowski244">Makowski, Bronisław (1986). Litwini w Polsce 1920-1939 (in Polish). Warszawa: PWN. ISBN 8301068051. p.244-303</ref> The Polonization of Lithuanians became reduced with more relaxed government policies only after Lithuania re-established diplomatic relations with Poland in 1938.

Polonization of the economy was advanced by Polish [[statism]]. Lack of private capital in the country after the First World War, and later state interventions and takeovers of politically important sectors in the aftermath of the [[Great Depression]], increasingly expanded the government economic sector. From 1931 on, the state industrial sector grew more rapidly than the private sector, however the Jewish minority was excluded from this sector of the economy. Even facing acute shortage of engineers, the responsible authorities preferred to leave positions vacant than fill them with Jewish experts <ref name="Strauss">Herbert Arthur Strauss "Hostages of Modernization: Studies on Modern Antisemitism, 1870-1933/39", [[Walter de Gruyter]], 1993, p. 1084</ref> Jews were also excluded from local administrations. In [[Lublin]], where Jews made up about 40% of the population, only 2.6% of municipal workers were Jews; in Warsaw 16% of the Poles, and only 0.8% of Jews, were employed in the state or public sectors <ref name="Strauss1050">Strauss, p.1050 </ref>. Efforts to Polonize the economy also affected Jews employed in the private sector. Boycotts of Jewish businesses were instigated by [[National Democracy|National-Democratic]] groups such as the [[League of the Green Band]] (Liga Zielonej Wstążki). The Catholic Church and Polish government condoned this  Polonization of the economy especially after the National Democrats gained control of the government in 1937.<ref name="Strauss1083">Strauss, p.1083 </ref>.

However, Polonization also created a new educated class among the non-Polish minorities, a class of intellectuals aware of the importance of schooling, press, literature and theatre, who became instrumental in the development of their own ethnic identities.<ref>Eugenia Prokop-Janiec, "Polskie dziedzictwo kulturowe w nowej Europie.

Some scholars emphasize the importance of the interwar government's Polonization policies for the preservation of Polish statehood in the long term.<ref>In an article written in 1968 for the fiftieth anniversary of Polish independence in 1918, and the emergence of the [[Polish Second Republic]], [[Jan Nowak-Jeziorański]] wrote: "Even a large amount of staunch criticism of the Polish independence of the [[History of Poland (1918–1939)|interwar period]] cannot overshadow the fact that the resurgence and rebuilding of the country was the biggest victory achieved by the Polish people in their history... The interwar period, short from the historical perspective, was by no means a finite episode. The twenty years of independence cemented Polish presence on the map of the world with such strength that no [[Hitler]] in collusion with [[Stalin]] in 1939, nor Stalin alone in 1945 were able to remove it again from among the European states... The biggest achievement of the interwar period for the sovereign Polish state was the making of a new generation of Poles, who proved themselves in a test of fire during [[World War II]]."

=== Post–World War II ===
Ethnic Germans still living in the western territories gained by Poland (determined by [[Tehran Conference]] by [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] in the aftermath of World War II - e.g. Silesia) were denied the use of their language in public by the Communist regime and they had to adopt the Polish language and citizenship to evade discrimination, expropriation and insult. Some 180,000 were sent to forced work camps like camp [[Toszek|Tost]], camp [[Central Labour Camp Potulice|Potulice]] or camp [[Łambinowice|Lamsdorf]].<ref name="WB_HL">[[Włodzimierz Borodziej]], [[Hans Lemberg]], ''Unsere Heimat ist uns ein fremdes Land geworden...

Western Germany however did not recognize this agreement. Until 1953 there were 55 German basic schools and 2 higher German schools in Poland. The Germans enjoy a formally recognized status of an ethnic minority in modern Poland.

During [[Operation Wisła]] in [[1947]], the Ukrainian and [[Rusyn]] populations were forcibly resettled from their historic territories in the south-east of  Poland to northern areas of the [[recovered territories|territories]] awarded by [[Allies of World War II|the Allies]] to Poland in the post-war settlement. According to the order of the Ministry of [[Recovered Territories]], "the main goal of the relocation of settlers "W" is their assimilation in a new Polish environment, all efforts should be exerted to achieve those goals. Do not apply the term "Ukrainians" towards the settlers. In cases when the intelligentsia element reaches the recovered territories, they should by all means be settled separately and away from the communities of the "W" settlers."<ref name="Дрозд">Роман Дрозд [http://nslowo.free.ngo.pl/z_istoriji_kultury/jaworzno_trahicznyj_symwol.htm Явожно– трагічний символ акції «Вісла»]</ref>

==Ethnicity of notable figures==
As a consequence of the process of cultural Polonization, disputes occur as to the ethnicity of some notable persons such as [[Tadeusz Kościuszko]], [[Adam Mickiewicz]] and [[Ignacy Domeyko]], who are claimed as national celebrities by [[Poles]], [[Belarusians]] and [[Lithuanians]] alike.
