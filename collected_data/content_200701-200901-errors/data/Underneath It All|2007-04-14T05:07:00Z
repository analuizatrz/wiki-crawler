"'''Underneath It All'''" is a [[pop music|pop]] song written by [[Gwen Stefani]] and [[Dave Stewart]] for [[No Doubt]]'s fourth album ''[[Rock Steady (album)|Rock Steady]]'' (2001). The song features [[reggae]] production, vocals from deejay [[Lady Saw]], and received mixed reviews from pop music critics. "Underneath It All" was released as the album's third [[single (music)|single]] in mid-2002 (see [[2002 in music]]) and was moderately successful. It was nominated for a [[Teen Choice Awards|Teen Choice Award]] in 2003 and received a [[Grammy Award]] for "[[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal|Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]]" in 2004.

==Background and writing==
The song was originally written by [[Gwen Stefani]] and [[David A. Stewart|Dave Stewart]] during Stefani's visit to boyfriend [[Gavin Rossdale]] in [[London]].  The two used backward string [[Sampling (music)|samples]] to write the song in only ten minutes.  Producers [[Sly and Robbie]] later added guest vocals from [[dancehall]] artist [[Lady Saw]].

==Chart performance==
"Underneath It All" peaked at number three on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart and number two for ten non-consecutive weeks on the [[Adult Top 40]] format. Although it was very successful in the U.S., reaction elsewhere was generally less enthusiastic. In Canada the song debuted on the [[Canadian Singles Chart|singles chart]] at number thirty-six and descended from the top fifty the following week. It became No Doubt's second-least successful Canadian single after "[[Ex-Girlfriend (song)|Ex-Girlfriend]]" (2000).

In the UK "Underneath It All" debuted at number eighteen and fell off the chart five weeks later. This feat echoed in Australia, where it peaked at number twenty-eight, but saw more success by remaining on the chart for seven weeks. In New Zealand it peaked at number eight for two consecutive weeks and garnered substantial [[airplay (radio)|airplay]].

The song reached the top thirty in [[Austria]] and [[Sweden]], the top forty in [[Brazil]] and [[Germany]], and the top sixty in [[Switzerland]]. It peaked at number eleven on the [[United World Chart]] for the week of [[November 23]] [[2002]].

==Music video==
The song's [[music video]] was directed by [[Sophie Muller]]. It features the band [[Cycling|bicycling]] and playing [[basketball]]. Stefani removes several pieces of clothing throughout the video, and in the last scene, she is jumping on a [[bed]], in [[white]] [[undergarment]]s and without [[Cosmetics|makeup]]. A scene from the video was used for the cover of the song's [[CD single]].

"Underneath It All" peaked at number two on [[MuchMusic]]'s ''[[Countdown (MuchMusic TV series)|Countdown]]'' in late 2002.  The video received nominations for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Pop Video|Best Pop Video]] and [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] at the [[2003]] [[MTV Video Music Awards]].
