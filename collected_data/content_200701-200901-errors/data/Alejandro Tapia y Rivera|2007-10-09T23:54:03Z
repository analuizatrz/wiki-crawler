Tapia is considered to be the father of [[Puerto Rican literature]] and that no one else has contributed more to the cultural advancement of Puerto Rico in literature.  In addition to his writing, Rivera was also a fervent [[abolitionist]] and a [[women's rights]] advocate.  Rivera received his primary education in San Juan under the guidance of the renowned educator [[Rafael Cordero (educator)|Rafael Cordero]], who was an early inspiration in his life.

Tapia was working for the State Department when  a Spanish Army artillery officer challenged him to a [[duel]], a challenge which he accepted; as a result, Tapia was deported to [[Spain]]. There he completed his studies in literature in [[Madrid]] ([[1850]]-[[1852]]), and joined the [[Society of the Recollection of Historical Documents]], relating to Puerto Rico.

Tapia organised and filed in order important Puerto Rican [[16th century|16th]] and [[17th century]] documents. He published his first important work called ''[[The Historical Library of Puerto Rico]]'' relating to those documents and his findings on them. 

Tapia was a member of the [[Progressive Action Political Party]].  Among his cultural positions was his membership of the [[Puerto Rican Intellectual Protective Society]]. He was also the director of the [[Youth Museum]] in [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]] and the founder and first president of the [[Ateneo Puertorriqueño]].

Among Tapia's many awards and honours were:
*The [[Medal of the Royal Knight]] and 
*The [[Distinguished Order of Carlos III]] from Spain.

Alejandro Tapia y Rivera died in the city of San Juan, Puerto Rico in [[July 19]], [[1882]] while giving a conference at the Ateneo Puertorriqueño.
