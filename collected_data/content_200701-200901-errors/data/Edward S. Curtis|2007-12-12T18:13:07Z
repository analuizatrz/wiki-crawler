'''Edward Sheriff Curtis''' ([[February 16]], [[1868]] &ndash; [[October 19]], [[1952]]) was a photographer of the [[American West]] and of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] peoples. <ref name=obit/> <ref name=makepeace/>

==Early life==
Edward Curtis was born near [[Whitewater, Wisconsin]]. <ref name=loc/> Curtis' father, Rev. Johnson Asahel Curtis (1840-1887), was a minister and a [[United States Civil War]] veteran. Rev. Curtis was born in [[Ohio]]. Rev. Curtis' father was born in [[Canada]], and his mother in [[Vermont]]. Edward's mother, Ellen Sheriff (1844-1912), was born in [[Pennsylvania]]; and both her parents were born in [[England]]. Curtis' siblings were Raphael Curtis (1862-c1885), who also was called Ray Curtis; Eva Curtis (1870-?); and [[Asahel Curtis]] (1875-1941). <ref name=census1880>[[:Image:1880 census Curtis Sheriff.gif|Curtis family]] in [[1880 US Census]] in [[Cordova Township, Minnesota]]</ref>

Around 1874 the family moved from Wisconsin to [[Minnesota]], and Curtis built his own camera. In 1880 the family was living in [[Cordova Township, Minnesota]], where Johnson Curtis was working as a retail grocer. <ref name=census1880/> <ref name=pbs>{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/database/curtis_e.html |title=Shadow Catcher |accessdate=2007-08-26 |quote=Edward S. Curtis was born near Whitewater, Wisconsin in 1868. His father, a Civil War veteran and a Reverend, moved the family to Minnesota, where Edward became interested in photography and soon constructed his own camera and learned how to process the prints. At the age of seventeen he became an apprentice photographer in St. Paul. The family moved near Seattle, Washington, where Edward purchased a second camera and bought a half interest in a photographic studio. He married and the couple had four children. |publisher=[[American Masters]] }}</ref> <!-- Richard Arthur Norton (1958- ) says: I am still looking through the census data for his entry in 1870, 1900, 1920 and 1930 Census -->

==Early career==
In 1885 at the age of seventeen Edward became an apprentice photographer in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]]. In 1887 the family moved to [[Seattle, Washington]], where Edward purchased a new camera and became a partner in an existing photographic studio with Rasmus Rothi. Edward paid $150 for his 50 percent share in the studio. After about six months, Curtis left Rothi and formed a new partnership with Thomas Guptill. The new studio was called Curtis and Guptill, Photographers and Photoengravers. <ref name=makepeace >{{cite book |last=Makepeace |first=Anne  |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Edward S. Curtis: Coming to Light |year=2001 |publisher=[[National Geographic]] |location= | pages= |isbn=0792264045 }}</ref> <ref name=loc/>

==Marriage==
[[Image:Curtis family.jpg|thumb|left|From left to right are Elizabeth M. Curtis (1896-1973) aka Beth Curtis; Harold Curtis (1894-?); Clara J. Phillips (1874-1932); and Florence Curtis (1899-?) circa 1905-1909]]
In 1892 Edward married Clara J. Phillips (1874-1932), who was born in [[Pennsylvania]]. Her parents were from [[Canada]]. Together they had four children: Harold Curtis (1893-?); Elizabeth M. (Beth) Curtis (1896-1973), who married Manford E. Magnuson (1895-1993); Florence Curtis (1899-1987) who married Henry Graybill (1893-?); and Katherine (Billy) Curtis (1909-?).

In 1896 the entire family moved to a new house in [[Seattle]]. The household then included Edward's mother, Ellen Sheriff; Edward's sister, Eva Curtis; Edward's brother, [[Asahel Curtis]]; Clara's sisters, Susie and Nellie Phillips; and Nellie's son, William.

==Middle career==
In 1895 Curtis met and photographed [[Princess Angeline]] (c1800-1896) aka Kickisomlo, the daughter of [[Chief Sealth]] of [[Seattle]]. This was to be his first portrait of a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]. In 1898 while photographing [[Mt. Rainier]], Curtis came upon a small group of scientists. One of them was [[George Bird Grinnell]], an expert on Native Americans. Grinnell became interested in Curtis' photography and invited him to join an expedition to photograph the Blackfeet Indians in Montana in the year 1900. <ref name=makepeace/>

==''The North American Indian''==
[[Image:10284052110512546776.jpg|thumb|right|The North American Indian, 1907]]
In 1906 [[J.P. Morgan]] offered Curtis $75,000 to produce a series on the North American Indian. <ref name=nyt1>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Mr. Edward Curtis's $3,000 Work on the Aborigine a Marvel of Pictorial Record.  |url= |quote=Photo-history is the apt word which has been coined to describe the work which Edward S. Curtis is doing for the North American Indian. Nothing just like it has ever before been attempted for any people. |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=[[June 6]], [[1908]] |accessdate=2007-08-21 }}</ref> It was to be in 20 volumes with 1,500 photographs. Morgan was to receive 25 sets and 500 original prints as his method of repayment. Curtis' goal was not just to photograph, but to document, as much American Indian (Native American) traditional life as possible before that way of life disappeared. He wrote in the introduction to his first volume in 1907: "The information that is to be gathered ... respecting the mode of life of one of the great races of mankind, must be collected at once or the opportunity will be lost." Curtis made over 10,000 wax cylinder recordings of Indian language and music. He took over 40,000 photographic images from over 80 tribes. He recorded tribal lore and history, and he described traditional foods, housing, garments, recreation, ceremonies, and funeral customs. He wrote biographical sketches of tribal leaders, and his material, in most cases, is the only recorded history. <ref name=makepeace/>
<!-- Richard Arthur Norton (1958- ) says: The Morgan Library says it still has a box of correspondences between the Morgans and Curtis and Morgan and Charles Lauriat -->

==Divorce==
In 1910 the family was living in Seattle and on [[October 16]], [[1916]], Clara filed for divorce. In 1919 she was granted the divorce and received the Curtis' photographic studio and all of his original camera negatives as her part of the settlement. Edward went with his daughter, Beth, to the studio and destroyed all of his original glass negatives, rather than have them become the property of his ex-wife, Clara. Clara went on to manage the Curtis studio with her sister, Nellie M. Phillips (1880-?), who was married to Martin Lucus (1880-?). In 1920 Beth Curtis and her sister Florence Curtis were living in a boarding house in Seattle. Clara was living in Charleston, [[Kitsap County, Washington]] with her sister Nellie and her daughter Katherine Curtis. <ref name=makepeace/> <!-- Richard Arthur Norton (1958- ) says: Nellie and Martin's descendants have been contacted in the hope they can provide more information on the siblings of Edward -->

==Hollywood==
[[Image:10284052110508890707.jpg|thumb|left|Indian Days of the Long Ago, 1915]]
Around 1922 Curtis moved to Los Angeles with his daughter Beth, and opened a new photo studio. To earn money he worked as an assistant cameraman for [[Cecil B. DeMille]] and was an uncredited assistant cameraman in the 1923 filming of ''The Ten Commandments''. On October 16, 1924 Curtis sold the rights to his ethnographic motion picture ''In the Land of the Head-Hunters'' to the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. He was paid $1,500 for the master print and the original camera negative. It had cost him over $20,000 to film. <ref name=makepeace/>

==Decline==
In 1927 after returning from [[Alaska]] to Seattle with his daughter Beth, he was arrested for failure to pay alimony over the preceding 7 years. The total owed was $4,500, but the charges were dropped. For Christmas of 1927, the family was reunited at daughter Florence's home in [[Medford, Oregon]]. This was the first time since the divorce that Curtis was with all of his children at the same time, and it had been thirteen years since he had seen Katherine. In 1928, desperate for cash, Edward sold the rights to his project to [[J. P. Morgan, Jr.|J.P Morgan's son]]. In 1930 he published the concluding volume of ''The North American Indian''.  In total about 280 sets were sold of his now completed ''opus magnum''. In 1930 his ex-wife, Clara, was still living in Seattle operating the photo studio with their daughter Katherine. His other daughter, Florence Curtis, was still living in Medford, Oregon with her husband Henry Graybill. In 1932 his ex wife, Clara, drowned while rowing in [[Puget Sound]], and his daughter, Katherine moved to California to be closer to her father and her sister, Beth. <ref name=makepeace/>

==Loss of rights to ''The North American Indian''==
In 1935 the rights and remaining unpublished material were sold by the Morgan estate to the Charles E. Lauriat Company in Boston for $1,000 plus a percentage of any future royalties. This included 19 complete bound sets of ''The North American Indian'', thousands of individual paper prints, the copper printing plates, the unbound printed pages, and the original glass-plate negatives. Lauriat bound the remaining loose printed pages and sold them with the completed sets. The remaining material remained untouched in the Lauriat basement in Boston until they were rediscovered in 1972.<ref name=makepeace/>

==Death and burial ==
[[Image:Edward Sheriff Curtis (1868-1952) obit.jpg|thumb|left|Curtis' obituary]] On [[October 19]], [[1952]], at the age of 84, Curtis died of a heart attack in [[Los Angeles, California]] in the home of his daughter, Beth. He was buried at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]] in Hollywood Hills, California. His terse obituary appeared in [[The New York Times]] on [[October 20]], [[1952]]:
<blockquote>
Edward S. Curtis, internationally known authority on the history of the North American Indian, died today at the home of a daughter, Mrs. Bess Magnuson. His age was 84. Mr. Curtis devoted his life to compiling Indian history. His research was done under the patronage of the late financier, [[J. Pierpont Morgan]]. The foreward [sic] for the monumental set of Curtis books was written by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. Mr. Curtis was also widely known as a photographer. <ref name=obit>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Edward S.

</blockquote>

==Curtis archive at the Library of Congress==
<blockquote>
The Prints and Photographs Division Curtis collection consists of more than 2,400 silver-gelatin, first generation photographic prints &mdash; some of which are sepia-toned &mdash; made from Curtis's original glass negatives. Most of the photographic prints are 5" x 7" although nearly 100 are 11" x 14" and larger; many include the Curtis file or negative number within the image at the lower left-hand corner.

Acquired by the [[Library of Congress]] through copyright deposit from about 1900 through 1930, the dates on the images reflect date of registration, not when the photograph was actually taken. About two-thirds (1,608) of these images were not published in the North American Indian volumes and therefore offer a different and unique glimpse into Curtis's work with indigenous cultures. The original glass plate negatives which had been stored and nearly forgotten in the basement of New York's [[The Morgan Library & Museum|Pierpont Morgan Library]] were dispersed during World War II. Many others were destroyed and some were sold as junk.<ref name=loc>{{cite web |url=http://www.loc.gov/rr/print/coll/067_curt.html |title=Edward S. Curtis Collection |accessdate=2007-08-26 |quote=Although unknown for many years, Edward S. Curtis is today one of the most well-recognized and celebrated photographers of Native people. Born near White Water, Wisconsin, on [[February 16]], [[1868]], he became interested in the emerging art of photography when he was quite young, building his first camera when he was still an adolescent. In Seattle, where his family moved in 1887, he acquired part interest in a portrait photography studio and soon became sole owner of the successful business, renaming it Edward S. Curtis Photographer and Photoengraver. |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] }}</ref>
</blockquote>
<!-- Richard Arthur Norton (1958- ) says: the LOC has an extensive collection of Curtis images, but almost none of him available online. They have been contacted and are looking into providing a scan of some of his self portraits for this article -->

==Charles Lauriat archive==
Around 1970, Karl Kernberger of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] went to Boston to search for Curtis' original copper plates and [[photogravure]]s at the Charles E. Lauriat rare bookstore. He discovered almost 285,000 original photogravures as well as all the original copper plates. With Jack Loeffler; and David Podwa, they jointly purchased all of the surviving Curtis material that was owned by Charles Emelius Lauriat (1874-1937). The collection was later purchased by another group of investors led by Mark Zaplin of Santa Fe. The Zaplin Group owned the plates until 1982, when they sold them to a California group led by Kenneth Zerbe, the current owner of the plates as of 2005. <!-- Richard Arthur Norton (1958- ) says: Zerbe has been contacted to see if they will provide a higher reolution image of Curtis -->

==Peabody Essex Museum==
Dr. [[Charles Goddard Weld]] purchased 110 prints that Curtis had made for his 1905-1906 exhibit and donated them to the [[Peabody Essex Museum]], where they remain.  The 14" by 17" prints are each unique and remain in pristine condition.  Clark Worswick, curator of photography for the museum, describes them as:
<blockquote>
"...Curtis' most carefully selected prints of what was then his life’s work...certainly these are some of the most glorious prints ever made in the history of the photographic medium. The fact that we have this man’s entire show of 1906 is one of the minor miracles of photography and museology." <ref name=pem>{{cite web |url=http://www.pem.org/exhibitions/exhibition.php?id=9 |title=The Master Prints of Edwards S. Curtis: Portraits of Native America |accessdate=2007-08-26 |quote=Edward Sheriff Curtis was just thirty-three years old in 1901 when he began his legendary effort to document the life and cultures of the North American Indian through photographs and interviews. By 1930 he had studied more than eighty tribes, taken more than 40,000 photographs, and earned the support of Theodore Roosevelt and J. P. Morgan, among others. |publisher=[[Peabody Essex Museum]] }}</ref>
</blockquote>

==Controversy==
Curtis has been praised as a gifted photographer but also criticized for manipulating his images by professional ethnologists. Curtis' photographs have been charged with misrepresenting Native American people and cultures by portraying them in the popular notions and stereotypes of the times. Although the early twentieth century was difficult time for most Native communities in America, not all natives were doomed to becoming a "vanishing race."<ref name=vanish>{{cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/award98/ienhtml/essay2.html |title=The Myth of the Vanishing Race |accessdate=2007-08-26 |quote= |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] }}</ref> At a time when natives' rights were being denied and their treaties were unrecognized by the federal government, many natives were successfully adapting to western society. By reinforcing the native identity as the [[noble savage]] and a tragic vanishing race, Curtis detracted attention from the true plight of American natives at the time when he was witnessing their squalid conditions on reservations first-hand and their attempt to find their place in Western culture and adapt to their changing world.<ref name=vanish/> 

In many of his images Curtis removed parasols, suspenders, wagons, and other traces of Western and material culture from his pictures. In his photogravure [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/curt:@field(DOCID+@lit(cp06005)) ''In a Piegan Lodge''], published in ''The North American Indian'', Curtis retouched the image to remove a clock between the two men seated on the ground.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/award98/ienhtml/essay3.html |title=Edward Curtis: Pictorialist and Ethnographic Adventurist |accessdate=2007-08-26 |quote= |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] }}</ref>

He also is known to have paid natives to pose in staged scenes, wear historically inaccurate dress and costumes, dance and partake in simulated ceremonies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.collectorsguide.com/fa/fa047.shtml |title=The Shadow Catcher |accessdate=2007-08-26 |quote= |publisher= }}</ref> In Curtis' picture [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/curt:@field(DOCID+@lit(cp03002)) ''Oglala War-Party''], the image shows 10 Oglala men wearing feather headdresses, on horseback riding down hill. The photo caption reads, "a group of Sioux warriors as they appeared in the days of inter tribal warfare, carefully making their way down a hillside in the vicinity of the enemy's camp." In truth headdresses would have only been worn during special occasions and, in some tribes, only by the chief of the tribe. The photograph was taken in 1907 when natives had been relegated onto reservations and warring between tribes had ended. Curtis paid natives to pose as warriors at a time when they lived with little dignity, rights, and freedoms. He altered and manipulated his pictures to create an ethnographic simulation of Native tribes untouched by Western society.
