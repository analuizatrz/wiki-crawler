'''Yodfat''' ({{lang-he|יודפת}}), is a non-religious [[Jew]]ish [[moshav]] located in the vicinity of the Atzmon mountain ridge north of the [[Beit Netofa Valley]] in the [[Western Galilee|Galilee]], south of [[Carmiel]] and within the municipal territory of the [[Misgav Regional Council]] in [[Israel]]. The moshav, named after the nearby [[Second Temple]]-era Judean city of the same name (in Hebrew), [[Jotapata]], was founded in 1958 by a group of graduates of the [[Hebrew Reali School]] of [[Haifa]]. Over the years, families from [[North America]] and [[England]] also joined this group.
