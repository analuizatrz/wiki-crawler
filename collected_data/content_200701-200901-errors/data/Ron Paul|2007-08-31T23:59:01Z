He had been offered a full [[scholarship]] to run for the track team but declined it, worried that he would not regain his previous speed.<ref name="dailypaul1"/> Paul was inducted into [[Lambda Chi Alpha]] fraternity,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.fraternalcaucus.org/greeks_congress|title= Greeks in Congress|accessdate=2007-07-08 |publisher= Capital Fraternal Caucus}}</ref> and he served as steward and house manager of the fraternity.<ref name="dailypaul1"/> He received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] [[Academic degree|degree]] in 1957.

Although he had once considered becoming a [[Lutheran]] minister like two of his brothers,<ref name="seattletimes"/> Paul decided to pursue a career in medicine instead and was accepted to [[Duke University School of Medicine]], where he received his [[Doctor of Medicine]] (M.D.) in 1961. He conducted his [[internship]] and a year of [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] training, both in [[internal medicine]], at [[Henry Ford Hospital]] in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] from 1961 to 1962 and residency in [[obstetrics]]/[[gynecology]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] from 1965 to 1968.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=P000583|title= PAUL, Ronald Ernest|accessdate= 2007-05-20|publisher= United States Congress}}</ref>

Paul is well-versed in the economic philosophy of the [[Austrian School]] of economics and has authored several books ([[Ron Paul#Books authored|see below]]) on the subject. He has pictures of [[Friedrich von Hayek]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], and [[Murray Rothbard]] hanging on his office wall.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.amconmag.com/2007/2007_06_18/cover.html|title= Lone Star|accessdate=2007-07-08 |author= Brendan Dougherty, Michael|publisher= ''The American Conservative''|date= 2007-06-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://photos-184.ll.facebook.com/photos-ll-sf2p/v77/31/32/153800184/n153800184_30173281_6346.jpg |title="Screenshot.

Two years after leaving medical school, Paul worked in the [[Emergency department|emergency room]] of a church hospital in [[San Antonio]] for a wage of [[US Dollar|$3]] an hour.

== Early congressional career ==

A physician for several years in his district before he went into politics, Paul became a [[delegate]] to the Republican Party of Texas [[Political convention|convention]] in 1974. He had decided to enter politics on [[August 15]], [[1971]], when President [[Richard Nixon]] advocated a complete departure from the [[gold standard]] for the U.S. dollar. He said, "After that day, all money would be political money rather than money of real value. I was astounded."<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/>

[[Image:Ron Paul and Reagan.jpg|right|frame|Ron Paul led the Texas Delegation to nominate [[Ronald Reagan]] (left to right: Ron Paul, [[Jack Fields]], Ronald Reagan, and [[William Reynolds Archer, Jr.|Bill Archer]])]]

Paul was an unsuccessful Republican candidate for Congressman from the 22nd District of Texas in 1974, an election where Democratic candidates won heavily, against the incumbent Democrat [[Robert R. Casey]]. When President [[Gerald R. Ford]] appointed Casey as head of the [[Federal Maritime Commission]], a [[special election]] was held in [[April]] [[1976]] to choose a new congressperson. Paul won that election but lost six months later in the [[general election]] to Democrat [[Robert Gammage|Robert A. Gammage]]. The vote was close: fewer than 300 votes out of 180,000. He then defeated Gammage in a 1978 rematch. Paul won new terms in 1980 and 1982. Paul was the first Republican to represent the area in the House of Representatives.<ref name="campaigncom">[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF-s1voM_Y The Ron Paul Story] on YouTube accessed on [[June 14]] [[2007]]</ref> He was one of only four Republican congressmen to endorse [[Ronald Reagan]] for president against [[Gerald Ford]] in 1976,<ref name="2008bio"/> when Paul led the Texas delegation in support of Reagan at the national Republican convention.<ref name="campaigncom"/>

Paul delivered babies on Mondays and Saturdays during his entire term as the 22nd District representative.<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/> During this time, he began to gain his reputation as "Dr. No", with his refusal to vote for laws he felt to be unconstitutional.<ref name="campaigncom"/>

Paul was the first member of Congress, in the 1970s, to propose [[term limit]] legislation for the House of Representatives,<ref name="wsj1997">[http://www.seedship.com/politics/ronpaul1.html The Libertarian Congressman Is Back] from ''The Wall Street Journal'' accessed on [[June 15]] [[2007]]</ref> where he declined to attend junkets or register for a congressional pension while serving four terms.<ref name="campaign1996">{{cite web |url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2519/is_n6_v17/ai_18535311|title= Paul vs. Laughlin — Ron Paul's campaign against Representative Greg Laughlin|author= Beiler, David|date= 1996-06|publisher= Campaigns and Elections}}</ref> He proposed legislation to decrease congressional pay at the rate of inflation.<ref name="wsj1997"/> In 1980, when a majority of Republicans favored President Carter's proposal to reinstate [[Selective Service|draft registration]], he told them that they were inconsistent in their views: they were more eager to register their children than they were to register their guns.<ref name="wsj1997"/>

Paul served on the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services|House Banking Committee]] during this time, where he spoke against the inflation he saw as being caused by the [[Federal Reserve]].<ref name="2008bio"/> He also spoke against the deregulation of banking rules that allowed for the [[Savings and loan crisis]] of the 1980s.<ref name="nytimesmagazine"/> The US Gold Commission created by Congress in 1982 was his idea, and his conclusions from the commission were published by the [[Cato Institute]] as the book ''The Case for Gold''.<ref name="gold">{{cite web |work= J Taylor's Gold & Technology Stocks|date= 2000-05-11 |title= In Defense of our "Unalienable Rights" |url= http://www.usagold.com/gildedopinion/taylorpaulintrvw.html}}</ref> Paul's chief of staff from 1978 to 1982 was [[Lew Rockwell]].<ref name="insight1997">{{Citation |journal= Insight on the News |date= 1997-01-10|author= Berlau, John}}</ref> Paul was a regular participant in the annual Congressional baseball game.<ref name="campaigncom"/>

Paul was an unsuccessful candidate for the [[U.S. Senate]] in the 1984 [[Republican Party (United States)|GOP]] primary against [[Phil Gramm]]. Having chosen to run for the Senate instead of re-election, Paul left Congress in 1985 and returned to full-time medical practice<ref name="2008bio"/> and was subsequently succeeded by [[Tom DeLay]], then a member of the [[Texas House of Representatives]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.lrl.state.tx.us/legis/members/roster.cfm?leg=68|title= Members and leaders of the Texas Legislature|accessdate=2007-07-08 |publisher= Legislative Reference Library of Texas}}</ref> In a farewell address on the House floor, Paul said, "Special interests have replaced the concern that the Founders had for general welfare. Vote trading is seen as good politics. The errand-boy mentality is ordinary, the defender of liberty is seen as bizarre. It's difficult for one who loves true liberty and utterly detests the power of the state to come to Washington for a period of time and not leave a true cynic."<ref name="insight1997"/>

== 1988 presidential campaign ==

In the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 presidential election]], Paul defeated American Indian activist [[Russell Means]] to win the [[United States Libertarian Party|Libertarian Party]]'s nomination for the [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidency]].<ref name="nytimesmagazine"/> Appearing on the ballot in 46 states and the [[District of Columbia]],<ref name="1988nytimes">{{cite web |url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0712FB3E5C0C748DDDA90994D0484D81|title= Now for a Real Underdog: Ron Paul, Libertarian, for President|date= 1988-10-17|publisher= ''[[The New York Times]]''}}</ref> he placed third in the [[popular vote]] (with 431,750 votes — 0.47%), behind Republican [[George H.

Bush had been [[Vice President of the United States|vice-president]].<ref name="campaign1996"/>

During his time as a Libertarian candidate, Paul gained supporters nationwide who agreed with him on many of his positions — on [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|gun rights]], [[fiscal conservatism]], [[home-schooling]], and abortion, and he won approval from others who thought the federal government was heading in the wrong direction on other issues. These supporters formed a nationwide support base that encouraged him to return to office and supported his campaigns financially.<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/> His 2008 campaign chair, Kent Snyder, first worked for Paul on the 1988 campaign, when Snyder says that Senator [[John McCain]] told him, "You're working for the most honest man in Congress."<ref name="txmonthly2007"/>

Paul said that he was trying to do more during his presidential run than reach office: he was trying to spread his liberty-minded ideas and would often talk to school groups that weren't old enough to vote. "We're just as interested in the future generation as this election. These kids will vote eventually, and maybe, just maybe, they'll go home and talk to their parents."<ref name="1988nytimes"/>

After the election, Paul had a coin business,<ref name="spectator1999">{{citation|title= A principled maverick|date= 1999-11|publisher= ''The American Spectator''}}</ref> began his own [[think tank]], the Foundation for Rational Economics and Education, and continued his medical practice until he returned to Congress.<ref name="spectator1999"/><ref name="nytimesmagazine"/>

== Newsletter article controversy ==

An article in a 1992 edition of Paul's ''Ron Paul Survival Report'' (a newsletter that he had published from 1985) contained disparaging comments concerning race and Paul's political opponents.<ref name=HoustonChronicle>{{cite news | title=CAMPAIGN '96 U.S. HOUSE Newsletter excerpts offer ammunition to Paul's opponent | url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070512114222/http://www.chron.com/content/chronicle/aol-metropolitan/96/05/23/paul.html | author=Alan Bernstein | publisher=Houston Chronicle | date=1996-05-22 | accessdate=2007-05-20}}</ref> According to the ''Atlanta Progressive News,'' the newsletter accused [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] of fathering [[Illegitimacy|illegitimate children]] and using [[cocaine]], and called [[U.S. House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Barbara Jordan]] a "fraud" and a "half-educated victimologist." The article said that government should lower the [[Defense of infancy|legal age for prosecuting youths as adults]], saying: "black males age 13 who have been raised on the streets and who have joined criminal gangs are as big, strong, tough, scary and culpable as any adult and should be treated as such." The newsletter also said, "only about 5 percent of blacks have sensible political opinions," "If you have ever been robbed by a black teen-aged male, you know how unbelievably fleet-footed they can be," and, "95 percent of the black males in [[Washington, D.C.]] are semi-criminal or entirely criminal."<ref>Searcy, R. (June 3, 2007) [http://www.atlantaprogressivenews.com/views/0024-views.html "The Ron Paul that Ron Paul Doesn't Want You to Know"] ''Atlanta Progressive News''</ref>

In a 2001 interview with ''[[Texas Monthly]]'' magazine, Paul acknowledged that the comments were printed in his newsletter under his name, but that they were written by a [[ghostwriter]] and did not represent his views. He said the derogatory remarks about Congresswoman Jordan were "the saddest thing, because Barbara and I served together and actually she was a delightful lady."<ref>[http://www.freemarketnews.com/WorldNews.asp?nid=41822 "Ron Paul Race Smear Erased?"] (May 22, 2007) ''FreeMarketNews.com''</ref> He stated that he took moral responsibility for comments with which he disagreed being published under his name. ''Texas Monthly'' explained, "What made the statements in the publication even more puzzling was that, in four terms as a U. S. congressman and one presidential race, Paul had never uttered anything remotely like this."<ref name="texasmonthly2001">{{cite web |url= http://www.texasmonthly.com/2001-10-01/feature7.php|title= Dr. No|author= Gwynne, S.C.|date= 2001-10-01|publisher= ''[[Texas Monthly]]''}}</ref>

[[Image:Ron paul.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Paul's Congressional portrait]]

In 1996, Paul returned to Congress after a tougher battle than he had faced in the 1970s. He was hopeful that he would be more effective in Congress after the Republicans took over both houses of Congress in the [[United States House elections, 1994|1994 election]].<ref name="paulsneery"/> His Republican primary opponent, [[Greg Laughlin]], had support from leaders within the Republican Party, including House Speaker [[Newt Gingrich]] and Texas Governor [[George W. Bush]].<ref name="campaign1996"/> Incumbent Laughlin had switched from the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] to the Republican side the year before, and the [[Republican National Committee]], hoping to encourage other Democrats to switch parties, threw its full support behind Laughlin. Despite these efforts by the national party and some of its aligned interest groups such as the [[NRA]], challenger Paul won the primary. It was the third time he had been elected to Congress as a non-incumbent.<ref name="nytimesmagazine"/>

While Gingrich and other Republican leaders visited the district stumping for Laughlin, Paul ran newspaper ads quoting Gingrich's harsh criticisms of Laughlin's voting record 14 months earlier, before Laughlin switched parties.<ref name="campaign1996"/> Baseball pitcher (and constituent) [[Nolan Ryan]], a friend of Paul's, served as his honorary campaign chairman and appeared in ads for him, and tax activist [[Steve Forbes]] also supported Paul's candidacy.<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/><ref name="nytimesmagazine"/> Paul was elected for the coastal 14th Congressional District rather than the 22nd District he had previously represented. The change in district was a result of the borders of redistricting<ref>{{cite web |url= http://ao.nictusa.com/ao/no/900023.html|title= Federal Election Commission Advisory Opinion Number 1990-23|accessdate= 2007-05-26|author= Elliott, Lee Ann|date= 1990-11-05|publisher= }}</ref> as Paul continued to maintain his home in Lake Jackson.

His Democratic opponent in the fall election, [[lawyer]] Charles "Lefty" Morris, lost in a close margin despite running numerous attacks on Paul, including his past votes to repeal federal [[Prohibition (drugs)|drug laws]] in favor of state legislation and portions of old newsletters, and was assisted by the national [[AFL-CIO]]. Paul in turn labeled Morris a pawn of trial lawyers and big labor. He raised more money than Morris, with the help of his national network of donors: $1.2 million to Morris' $472,153. Ken Bryan, a Democratic consultant to some of Paul's opponents, has said, "He has one of the largest contributor bases in Congress, outside of the leadership." Most of Paul's contributions are given in small amounts by individuals.<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/> That year, he had the third-highest amount of individual contributions of any House member, behind Speaker [[Newt Gingrich]] and [[Bob Dornan]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.reason.com/news/show/118086.html|title= Paul for President?:The maverick libertarian Republican talks on war, immigration, and presidential ambition.|accessdate= 2007-05-28|author= Doherty, Brian|date= 2007-01-22|publisher= ''Reason Magazine'' }}</ref>

In 1998 he again won the primary and the election and outraised his opponent by a large margin, $2.1 million to $734,000. Opposing a Democratic rice farmer and former [[Matagorda County, Texas|Matagorda County]] judge, Loy Sneary, Paul won by 11 percentage points; he ran ads warning voters to be "leery of Sneary."<ref name="saynot">{{cite web |url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/08/AR2006070800966_2.html|title= Congressman Paul's Legislative Strategy?

=== Relationship with district ===

Paul continued to work as an [[obstetrician]] in [[Brazoria County, Texas]], even while serving in [[United States Congress|Congress]], delivering many of his constituents' babies. As of 2001, he was one of few doctors in the House (eight, including dentists) and part of an even smaller group that continued to practice while in office. Journalists have reported that it is not unusual for younger people in his home district to approach the congressman and say that he delivered them.<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/>

Paul opposes some forms of legislation that coastal or rural members of Congress typically support. Paul's district in Texas borders the [[Gulf of Mexico]] with 675 miles of coastline and also includes suburbs of [[Houston]]; it was redistricted prior to the 2004 election. Paul is opposed to federally funded [[flood insurance]] because it requires those who do not live near [[flood]] zones to subsidize those who choose to live in an area that is prone to flooding and does not allow those in flood zones to choose their own insurer. In an "overwhelmingly rural region," Paul opposes farm subsidies because they go to big corporations rather than small farmers. Despite voting against bills with large support in Congress, such as the farm bill, the congressman's "contrarian nature" and devotion to lowering taxes has appealed to voters in the 14th District.<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/>

While Paul votes against most spending bills, he has diverted funds that have been authorized by other bills into his own district.<ref name="wsj2003">{{cite web |url= http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB104725224693862700.html|title= A Far-Right Texan Inspires Antiwar Left|accessdate= 2007-06-15|author= Murray, Shailagh|date= 2003-03-10|year= 2003|publisher= ''The Wall Street Journal''}}</ref> Paul spends time in the district to compensate for "violat[ing] almost every rule of political survival you can think of."<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/> He sometimes spends three to four days a week in his district addressing constituents' concerns, often accompanied by one of his 17 grandchildren. He attends graduations, civic ceremonies, and [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scout]] honor ceremonies. In an expansive district, it is not unusual for him to log more than 300 miles per day visiting [[constituents]] or handling their concerns. He reaches out to 14th District voters on veterans' issues, such as procuring medals for war veterans who lost or never received their medals; he holds medal ceremonies for those whose medals are being presented. He has helped senior citizens of the district get free or low-cost prescription drugs through a little-known drug company program.<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/> His staff sends out birthday cards to constituents, as well as [[condolence]] cards on the deaths of family members.<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/>

=== Legislation ===

Paul sponsors many bills in Congress, such as those that would abolish the [[income tax]] or the [[Federal Reserve]], many of which do not get out of committee. Nevertheless, he has been named one of the "50 Most Effective Members of Congress" by ''Congressional Quarterly''.<ref name="ronpaulis">{{cite web |url= http://www.ronpaulforcongress.com/html/ronpaulis.html |title= Ron Paul Is… | accessdate= 2007-06-15|publisher= Ron Paul for Congress}}</ref> He has sponsored successful legislation to prevent the [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]] from seizing a church in New York state through [[eminent domain]] and a bill transferring ownership of the [[Lake Texana]] dam project from the federal government to [[Texas]].<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/>

Paul said in 2004 that he had refused to vote for more than 700 bills creating a larger government over his previous two terms in office.<ref name="scspeech">{{cite web |url= http://www.lewrockwell.com/yates/yates92.html|title= An Evening With Dr. Ron Paul|accessdate= 2007-06-13|author= Steven Yates|date= 2004-04-07|year= 2004|publisher= Lew Rockwell}}</ref> In [[March 2001]], Paul introduced the "Constitutional War Powers Resolution of 2001," which would repeal the 1973 [[War Powers Resolution]], and thus prohibit presidents from initiating a war without a formal [[Declaration of war by the United States|declaration of war]] by Congress.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=22022|title= Bill would restore Congress' war powers|accessdate= 2007-06-13|author= Jon Dougherty|date= 2001-03-13|year= 2001|publisher= World Net Daily}}</ref> In 2001, however, Paul voted for the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force]], which authorized the president, pursuant to War Powers Resolution, to respond to those responsible for the [[September 11]], [[2001]] terrorist attack.<ref name="AUMF"/>

Paul was one of 17 members of Congress who formed a bipartisan coalition to file a lawsuit against President [[Bill Clinton]] in 1999 over his conduct of the war in [[Kosovo]]. In the filing, they accused Clinton of not reporting to Congress within 48 hours on the status of the action as required by the 1973 War Powers Resolution and not first obtaining a [[Declaration of war by the United States|declaration of war]] from Congress as specifically required in the Constitution. Congress had voted 427 to 2 against a declaration of war with [[Yugoslavia]] and had voted to deny support for the air campaign in Kosovo. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit, ruling that since Congress had voted for funding after the United States was already actively engaged in the war with Kosovo, legislators had sent a confusing message about whether they approved of the war. Paul said that the judge's decision was an attempt to circumvent the Constitution and authorize the president to conduct a war without approval from Congress.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.house.gov/paul/press/press99/pr060999.htm|title= Judge sides with Clinton|accessdate= 2007-06-12|author= Ron Paul's Congressional office|date= 1999-06-09|year= 1999|publisher= US House of Representatives homepage}}</ref>

In order to prevent Congress from yielding its constitutional authority to declare war to the executive branch, which does not constitutionally hold that power, Paul introduced legislation in [[October 2002]] giving Congress the opportunity to declare war on [[Iraq]], rather than merely "authorizing" the president to deploy forces without a declaration of war. He said he would not vote for his own bill, but if his fellow members of Congress wished to go to war in Iraq, they should follow the Constitution and [[Declaration of war by the United States|declare war]]. In a hearing on the resolution, Republican Rep. [[Henry Hyde]] said, "There are things in the Constitution that have been overtaken by events, by time. Declaration of war is one of them. There are things no longer relevant to a modern society. Why declare war if you don’t have to? We are saying to the President, use your judgment. So, to demand that we declare war is to strengthen something to death. You have got a hammerlock on this situation, and it is not called for. Inappropriate, anachronistic, it isn’t done anymore."<ref name="scspeech"/> As one of six Republicans to vote against the Iraq War Resolution, Paul inspired the founding of a group called the National Peace Lobby Project to promote a resolution he and Oregon representative [[Peter DeFazio]] sponsored to repeal the war authorization in February 2003. His column "35 Questions That Won't Be Asked About Iraq"<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.house.gov/paul/congrec/congrec2002/cr091002.htm|title=Questions that won't be asked about Iraq|accessdate= 2007-07-12|author=Congressman Ron Paul|date= 2002-09-10|year= 2002|publisher= US House of Representatives homepage}}</ref> was translated and published in German, French, Russian, Italian, and Swiss publications before the Iraq War began.<ref name="wsj2003"/>

Paul has said his fellow members of Congress have increased domestic spending by 33 percent since Bush came into office. After introduction of a 2005 bill that was touted as "slashing" government waste, he wrote that the bill only decreased spending by less than a fraction of one percent and that "Congress couldn't slash spending if the members' lives depended on it."<ref name="budgetslashing">{{cite web |url= http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul287.html|title= Too Little Too Late|accessdate= 2007-06-13|author= Ron Paul|date= 2005-11-15|year= 2005|publisher= Lew Rockwell}}</ref>

=== Internet popularity ===

Paul has participated in four [[Republican Presidential Debates, 2008|Republican presidential debates]], three of which he won according to the sponsors' online polls. After the first debate, [[ABC News]] noted that Paul has a robust online presence and that "his supporters have mastered the art of 'viral marketing,' using Internet savvy and blog postings to create at least the perception of momentum for his long-shot presidential bid."<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Story?id=3147940 ABC analysis of "The Ron Paul Effect"]</ref> ''[[U.S. News]]'' has reported him to have an increasing on-line popularity, saying "his supporters have flocked to the Internet with such enthusiasm that Paul is now showing up among the much richer candidates in various measures of [[Internet traffic]]."<ref name="usnews0509">[http://www.usnews.com/usnews/blogs/news_blog/070509/ron_pauls_online_rise.htm U.S.News and World Report: Ron Paul's Online Rise] accessed on May 10, 2007</ref> According to ''[[USA Today]]'', Ron Paul is an "online natural."<ref name=usatweb />

However, Aaron Krane, a spokesman for Technorati, has stated his company's position that Ron Paul's search popularity is genuine to the best of their knowledge.<ref name="usnews0509" />
