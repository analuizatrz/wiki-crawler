The '''Severn Tunnel''' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]: ''Twnnel Hafren'') is a [[railway]] [[tunnel]] in the [[United Kingdom]], linking [[South Gloucestershire]] in the west of [[England]] to [[Monmouthshire]] in south [[Wales]] under the [[estuary]] of the [[River Severn]]. It was built by the [[Great Western Railway]] (GWR) between [[1873]] and [[1886]], and is 4 miles 624 yd (7,008 m) long, and is still the longest mainline railway tunnel within the UK (though the [[Channel Tunnel]] is longer).  In [[2007]], the opening of Phase 2 of the [[Channel Tunnel Rail Link]] will take this record away. Only 2Â¼ miles (3.62 km) of the tunnel are actually under the river.

Prior to the building of the tunnel, communications between the [[Bristol]] area and South Wales were primarily by boat. With the coming of the railway, services were forced to either take a long detour via [[Gloucester]], or to transfer their passengers and cargo onto a [[ferry]]. The GWR proposed to drive a tunnel under "The Shoots", a relatively narrow but unusually deep section of the estuary. This meant steep gradients by railway standards in order to reach the required depth.

Work on the tunnel began in March 1873, and proceeded gradually through the 1870s. As Thomas Walker notes in his book, GWR had expected the critical part of the work to be the tunnelling under the deep-water channel of the Shoots. However, the builders' real difficulties began in October [[1879]]. At this stage, when only 130 yards (119 m) remained separating the main  tunnel heading being driven from the Welsh side, and the shorter Gloucestershire heading, the workings were inundated, from a large fresh-water source ("The Great Spring") tapped by the heading being driven inland on the Welsh side.

[[Thomas A. Walker]] was the contractor entrusted by the chief GWR engineer Sir [[John Hawkshaw]] with rescuing and completing the tunnel after the 1879 flooding. Holding the Great Spring in check required the installation of greatly increased pumping facilities, and a diver had to be sent down a shaft and 300 m along the tunnel heading to close a door in the workings and seal off the waters. This troublesome task was finally achieved in November 1880 by lead diver [[Alexander Lambert]] using [[Henry Fluess|Henry Fluess']] new [[self contained breathing apparatus]], but work in the area of the Great Spring was unable to continue until January [[1881]] when the Great Spring was temporarily sealed off. Work was later disrupted in 1883 by further flooding from the Great Spring, and again Lambert managed to save the day. Additional mishaps afflicting the workings included a large tidal wave and a breakthrough of the bed of a pool (the "Salmon Pool") on the English side. In the intervening period the [[Severn Railway Bridge]] from [[Sharpness]] to [[Lydney]] was opened.

The tunnel was completed during 1885 and a goods train passed through it on [[January 9]], [[1886]], but regular services had to wait until the pumping systems were complete. The tunnel opened to goods trains in September and to passenger traffic in December 1886, nearly 14 years after work had started. Fixed [[steam engine]]s pumped out the Great Spring and other sources of water until the [[1960s]], when they were replaced by electrically powered pumps.

The Second Road Crossing (usually but slightly misleadingly called the [[Severn crossing#Second Severn Crossing|Second Severn Crossing]]), which passes above the tunnel, crosses over it on a "ground level bridge" on the English side, (near the Salmon Pool), supported in such a way that no load is imposed on the tunnel. The opportunity  was taken to renew the concrete cap above the tunnel in the Salmon Pool during bridge-construction.

There is also a second tunnel under the river just upstream near this point, carrying a high-capacity electricity cable (SuperGrid) under the river, and complementing the earlier high-capacity link, which is slung high over the river (just downstream of the first road bridge). Both electricity links were originally commissioned by the [[CEGB]].

During [[World War II]], a [[Great Western Railway]] passenger train was pursued by a German aircraft along the main line to Wales.  Reaching speeds estimated at 90mph (well above the wartime restrictions in place) the train successfully escaped into the tunnel and stopped beneath the river until the driver judged that the danger had passed.  The train was struck by several bullets during the chase but there were no serious injuries.
