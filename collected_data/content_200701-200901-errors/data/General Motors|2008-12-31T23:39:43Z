'''General Motors Corporation''' ('''GM''') ({{nyse|GM}}),the world's largest automaker, has been the annual global industry sales leader for 77 years. Founded in 1908, GM today employs about 266,000 people around the world. With global headquarters in Detroit, GM manufactures its cars and trucks in 35 countries. In 2007, nearly 9.37 million GM cars and trucks were sold globally under the following brands: [[Buick]], [[Cadillac]], [[Chevrolet]], [[GM Daewoo]], [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]], [[Holden]], [[Hummer]], [[Opel]], [[Pontiac]], [[Saab Automobile|Saab]], [[Saturn Corporation|Saturn]], [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]], and [[SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile|Wuling]]. GM's OnStar subsidiary is the industry leader in vehicle safety, security and information services. <ref>http://www.gm.com/corporate/about/</ref> GM's largest national market is the United States, followed by China, Brazil, the United Kingdom, Canada and Germany. <ref> http://www.gm.com/corporate/about/company.jsp </ref>

In recent years the company has endured significant financial turmoil, including a $50 billion dollar loss in 2007 and 2008.
On December 19, 2008, the Bush administration granted $17.4 billion in low-interest loans for GM and [[Chrysler]] on its own initiative to weather the current credit crisis.

== History ==
{{main|History of General Motors}}

General Motors (GM) was founded on September 16, 1908, in [[Flint, Michigan]], as a [[holding company]] for [[Buick]], then controlled by [[William C. Durant]], and acquired [[Oldsmobile]] later that year. The next year, Durant brought in [[Cadillac]], [[Elmore (automobile)|Elmore]], [[Oakland automobile|Oakland]] (later known as Pontiac) and several others. In 1909, General Motors acquired the Reliance Motor Truck Company of [[Owosso, Michigan]], and the Rapid Motor Vehicle Company of [[Pontiac, Michigan]], the predecessors of [[GMC (automobile)|GMC Truck]]. Durant lost control of GM in 1910 to a bankers' trust, because of the large amount of debt taken on in its acquisitions coupled with a collapse in new vehicle sales. A few years later, Durant would start the [[Chevrolet]] Motor car company and through this he secretly purchased a controlling interest in GM. Durant took back control of the company after one of the most dramatic [[proxy wars]] in American business history. Shortly after, he again lost control for good after the new vehicle market collapsed. [[Alfred Sloan]] was picked to take charge of the corporation and led it to its post war global dominance. This unprecedented growth of GM would last through the late 70's and into the early 80's.

==Company overview==
General Motors currently employs approximately 266,000 people around the world. GM's global headquarters is the [[Renaissance Center]] located in [[Detroit, Michigan]], United States. In 2007, 9.37 million GM [[cars]] and [[trucks]] were produced in 35 different countries. GM is the majority shareholder in [[GM Daewoo|GM Daewoo Auto & Technology Co.]] of South Korea and has had many collaborations with the world's various automakers. This includes product, powertrain and purchasing collaborations with [[Suzuki|Suzuki Motor Corp.]] and [[Isuzu|Isuzu Motors Ltd.]] of Japan, advanced technology collaborations with [[Toyota|Toyota Corporation]] and [[BMW|BMW AG]] of Germany and vehicle manufacturing ventures with several of the world's automakers including Toyota, Suzuki, Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp. of China, [[AvtoVAZ]] of Russia, [[Renault|Renault SA]] of France, and most recently, UzAvtosanoa of Uzbekistan. GM also had collaborations with [[Fiat|Fiat S.p.A]] (see [[GM/Fiat Premium platform]]) and [[Ford Motor Company]]. To this day, GM retains various stakes in many different automakers.

GM parts and accessories are sold under [[GM Goodwrench]] and [[Delco Electronics|ACDelco]] brands through GM Service and Parts Operations which supplies GM dealerships and distributors worldwide. GM engines and transmissions are marketed through [[GM Powertrain]]. GM's largest national market is the United States, followed by China, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Germany. GM owns nearly-half (49%) of the finance company [[General Motors Acceptance Corporation|GMAC Financial Services]], which offers automotive, residential and commercial financing and insurance. GM's [[OnStar]] subsidiary is a vehicle safety, security and information service provider.

There have only been a few models bearing the General Motors brand. The GM [[EV1]] was introduced in the 1990s but was later discontinued. The GM [[General Motors Sequel|Sequel]] was a hydrogen fuel cell concept vehicle introduced in 2005, however the name was later changed to [[Chevrolet Sequel]]. Along with various concept vehicles, the [[Holden Statesman]] luxury sedan (1971 - 1985) was originally marketed as the General Motors Statesman.

The General Motors Aftermarket Business in the US manages four brands; Goodwrench, ACDelco, GM Performance Parts and GM Accessories. GM Aftersales operates globally.

== Human resources==
Together with the [[United Auto Workers]], GM created a joint venture dedicated to the quality of life needs of employees in 1985. The UAW-GM Center for human resources in [[Detroit]] is dedicated to providing GM salaried employees and GM UAW members programs and services related to medical care, diversity issues, education, training and [[tuition]] assistance, as well as programs related to work and family concerns, in addition to the traditional union-employer [[health and safety]] partnership.<ref>[https://www.uawgmjas.org/j/index.php?option=com_frontpage&Itemid=1 "Welcome to the UAW-GM Center for Human Resources"]. ''UAW-GM Joint Activity System''. Retrieved on June 19, 2007.</ref>

== Marketing in the United States ==
At one time, each of GM's automotive divisions in the United States were targeted to specific market segments and despite some shared components, each distinguished itself from its stablemates with unique styling and technology. The shared components and common corporate management created substantial [[economy of scale|economies of scale]], while the distinctions between the divisions created an orderly upgrade path, with an entry-level buyer starting out with a practical and economical [[Chevrolet]] and moving through offerings of the different divisions until the purchase of a [[Buick]] or [[Cadillac]].

The postwar automobile industry became enamoured with the concept of "[[planned obsolescence]]", implemented by both technical and styling innovations with a typical 3-year product cycle. In this cycle, a new basic body shell is introduced and then modified for the next two years with minor styling changes. GM, [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], and [[Chrysler Corporation|Chrysler]] competed vigorously in this new restyling environment.

=== Distinguishing the brands ===
By 1958, the divisional distinctions within GM began to blur with the availability of high-performance engines in [[Chevrolet]]s and [[Pontiac]]s. The introduction of higher trim models such as the [[Chevrolet Impala]] and [[Pontiac Bonneville]] priced in line with some [[Oldsmobile]] and [[Buick]] offerings was also confusing to consumers. By the time [[Pontiac]], [[Oldsmobile]] and [[Buick]] introduced similarly styled and priced compact models in 1961, the old "step-up" structure between the divisions was nearly over.

=== Compacts arrive ===
The decade of the 1960s saw the creation of compact and intermediate classes. The [[Chevrolet Corvair]] was a 6-cylinder answer to the [[Volkswagen Beetle]], the Chevy II was created to match Ford's conventional [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Falcon]] and the [[Chevrolet Camaro]]/[[Pontiac Firebird]] was GMs counter measure to the [[Ford Mustang]].  Among intermediates, the [[Oldsmobile Cutlass]] nameplate became so popular during the 1970s that [[Oldsmobile]] applied the Cutlass name to most of its products in the 1980s. By the mid 1960s, most of GM's vehicles were built on a few common ''platforms'' and in the 1970s GM began to use nearly identical body panel stampings, differing only in internal and external trim items. 

The 1971 [[Chevrolet Vega]] was GM's launch into the new subcompact class. Problems associated with its innovative [[aluminum]] engines would damage GMs reputation more than perhaps any other vehicle in its history. During the late 1970s, GM would initiate a wave of [[downsizing]] starting with the [[Chevrolet Caprice]] which was reborn into what was the size of the [[Chevrolet Chevelle]], the Malibu would be the size of the Nova, and the Nova was replaced by the troubled front-wheel drive [[Chevrolet Citation]].

=== The electric car ===
In 1990, GM debuted the revolutionary "Impact" concept car at the Los Angeles Auto Show. It was the first car with zero-emissions marketed in the US in over three decades. The Impact was eventually produced as the [[EV1]] for the 1996 model year. It was available through dealers located in only a few regions (e.g., California, Arizona, Georgia). Vehicles were leased, rather than sold, to individuals. In 2003 GM decided to cease production of the vehicles. All EV1's were either destroyed or donated to museums or universities.

=== GM in the new century ===
In the late 1990s, the U.S. economy was on the rise and GM and [[Ford]] gained market share producing enormous profits primarily from the sale of light trucks and sport-utility vehicles. From 2000 to 2001, the [[Federal Reserve]] in a move to quell the stock market, made twelve successive interest rate increases. Following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], a severe stock market decline caused a pension and benefit fund underfunding crisis.   GM began its ''Keep America Rolling'' campaign, which boosted sales, and other auto makers were forced to follow suit. The U.S. automakers saw sales increase to leverage costs as gross margins deteriorated. Although retiree health care costs remain a significant issue, General Motors' investment strategy has generated a $17.1 billion surplus in 2007 in its $101 billion U.S. pension fund portfolio, a $35 billion reversal from its $17.8 billion of underfunding.<ref name = "qvoyrs">Sloan, Allan (April 10, 2007).[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/09/AR2007040901262.html GM's High-Performance Pension Machine] ''Washington Post'', D02.</ref>

In 2004, GM redirected resources from the development of new sedans to an accelerated refurbishment of their light trucks and [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]]s for introduction as 2007 models in early 2006. Shortly after this decision, fuel prices increased by over 50% and this in turn affected both the trade-in value of used vehicles and the perceived desirability of new offerings in these market segments. The current marketing plan is to tout these revised vehicles extensively as offering the best fuel economy ''in their class'' (of vehicle). GM claims its hybrid trucks will have gas-mileage improvements of 25%. 

In the summer of 2005, GM announced that its corporate chrome emblem "[[Mark of Excellence]]" will begin appearing on all recently introduced and all-new 2006 model vehicles produced and sold in North America. The move is seen as an attempt by GM to link its name and vehicle brands more closely. 

In 2005, GM promoted sales through an employee discount to all buyers. Marketed as the lowest possible price, GM cleared an inventory buildup of 2005 models to make way for its 2006 lineup. While the promotion was a temporary shot in the arm for sales, it did not help the company's bottom line. GM has since changed its marketing strategy to a no haggle sticker policy in which all vehicle prices are lowered, but incentives are reduced, if not eliminated.

====Decline of SUV sales====
In 2008 rapidly rising gas prices resulted in a 30% drop off of sales of SUVs which had been GM's most profitable product, often returning profits of 10 to 15 thousand dollars per vehicle. Sales of SUVs had been decreasing since 2004, but in May, 2008 a $2 billion investment program for a new SUV platform, the CXX program, was canceled<ref>http://www.worldcarfans.com/9081028.003/gm-cancels-all-future-full-size-suvs</ref> and on Oct. 13 it was announced that it would close the Janesville, Wisconsin plant, which built full-sized SUVs. During the first 6 months of 2008 GM lost $18.8 billion and by late October its stock had dropped 76% and it was considering a merger with Chrysler. In only 12 months (October 2007-2008) GM sales in US have dropped 45 % [http://auto.mail.ru/text.html?id=27985] GM's concentration on SUVs as a profit center dated from the 1990s.<ref>{{cite news

== GM in China ==
General Motors is the best selling foreign auto maker in China.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060105/AUTO01/601050436/1148|title=GM becomes top-selling foreign automaker in China|work=[[Detroit News]]|accessmonthday=April 10 |accessyear=2007}}</ref> The [[Buick]] brand is especially strong, led by the [[Buick Excelle]] subcompact. [[Cadillac]] initiated sales in China in 2004, starting with imports from the United States. GM pushed the marketing of the [[Chevrolet]] brand in China in 2005 as well, moving the former [[Buick Sail]] to that marque. The company manufactures most of its China-market vehicles locally, through its [[Shanghai GM]] joint venture. Shanghai GM, a joint venture between the Chinese company SAIC and General Motors, was created on March 25, 1997. The Shanghai GM plant was opened December 15, 1998 when the first Chinese-built Buick came off the assembly line. The [[SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile]] joint-venture is also successful selling trucks and vans under the [[SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile|Wuling]] marque (34% belongs to GM).

GM plans to create a research facility in Shanghai for $250m to develop [[hybrid car]]s and [[alternative energy vehicle]]s. This move has been criticized because it pushes outsourcing to the very limit.<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/10/29/business/gm.php "GM plans a research center in Shanghai for hybrid technology"], ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', October 29, 2007</ref>

== Reaction to 2008 global economic decline ==
On October 10, 2008, GM considered exchanging its remaining 49% stake in [[GMAC]] to [[Cerberus Capital Management]] for [[Chrysler|Chrysler LLC]], potentially merging two of [[Big Three automobile manufacturers#United States|Detroit's "Big Three"]] automakers.<ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081011/ap_on_bi_ge/gm_chrysler_merger_talks Reports: Chrysler, GM discuss merger, acquisition]</ref>  Acquisition talks involving Chrysler were cancelled, however, before November 7, 2008, as part of a broader response to the increasing urgency of GM's own cash flow problems. That was a result of Chrysler's senior bank debt currently trading at less than 50 cents on the dollar and because Chrysler's other owner – Daimler, formerly Daimler Chrysler – recently revalued its 19.9% Chrysler stake down to zero, which may or may not reflect its value in a potential sale.<ref>''Bloomberg.com'' [http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=aPtO113gTIUs&refer=news GM Says It May Run Out of Operating Cash This Year (Update2) By Jeff Green and Mike Ramsey]</ref>. 

On December 12, 2008, General Motors stated that it was nearly out of cash, and may not survive past 2009.  The [[U.S. Senate]] voted and strongly opposed any source of government assistance through a bailout bridge loan (originally worth $14 billion in emergency aid) which was aimed toward helping the struggling [[Big Three automobile manufacturers|Big Three]] automakers financially, despite strong support from President [[George W. Bush]] and President-elect [[Barack Obama]], along with some mild support from both parties (Democratic and Republican).

Prior to the U.S. Senate's announcement, General Motors announced that it had hired several [[lawyers]] to discuss the possibility of filing for [[bankruptcy]], with [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] being one of the options discussed. GM stated that "all options are on the table" for the company. [[Chrysler LLC]], which is owned by [[Cerberus Capital Management]], is in a similar financial situation and like General Motors, warned that it, too, was nearly out of cash and may not survive much longer.

On December 18, 2008, President Bush announced that an "orderly" bankruptcy is one option being considered for both General Motors and [[Cerberus Capital Management|Cerberus]]-owned [[Chrysler LLC]]. Sources say that setting up this type of "orderly" bankruptcy would be complicated because it would not only involve talks with the automakers, but also the unions and other stakeholders would have to be involved.

On December 19, 2008, Bush approved a bailout plan and gave General Motors and Chrysler $13.4 billion in financing from TARP ([[Troubled Assets Relief Program]]) funds, as well as $4 billion to be "withdrawn later."

=== Advertising 2008–2009 ===
On August 18, 2008, GM announced it has dropped its advertising for the Emmys in September and for the upcoming 2009 [[Academy Awards]].<ref>[http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/content_display/news/national-broadcast/e3ie2e24571645310cba674a8120f0f1ef0 "General Motors Drives Away From Oscar Stage"], ''[[MEDIAWEEK]]'', August 18, 2008</ref> GM cited cost cutting and a return to marketing that works best. Media outlets have been struggling in the face of American automakers cutting "billions" in advertisements as the economy slows and American automakers struggle. American automakers have cut $414 million in advertising spending in the first quarter of 2008 alone.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/11/business/media/11auto.html?ref=todayspaper "Media Outlets Losing Money From a Lack of Auto Ads"], ''[[New York Times]]'', August 10, 2008</ref> On September 22, 2008, GM announced that it would not advertise in the 2009 [[Super Bowl]], citing the cost and the fact that they will not have any particular vehicles to launch at that time.<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/2008-09-22-gm-no-super-bowl-ads_N.htm "GM opts against Super Bowl ad amid cost cutting"] USA Today.

== Subsidies ==
In March 2005, the [[Government of Canada]] provided [[Canadian dollar|C$]]200 million in incentives to General Motors for its Ontario plants to expand production and provide jobs, according to [[Jim Harris (politician)|Jim Harris]]. Similar incentives were promised to non-North American auto companies like Toyota; Premier Dalton McGuinty said the money the province and Ottawa are pledging for the project is well-spent.

== Labor relations ==
=== 2007 United Auto Workers strike ===
{{main|2007 General Motors strike}}   
On September 24, 2007 General Motors workers represented by the [[United Auto Workers]] union went on the first nationwide strike against GM since 1970. The ripple effect of the strike reached into Canada the following day as two car assembly plants and a transmission facility were forced to close. Overnight a tentative agreement was reached, however, and UAW officials declared the end of the strike in a news conference at 4 a.m. on September 26. By the following day, all GM workers in both countries were back to work.

==== Outcome of strike ====
A new labor contract was ratified by UAW members exactly one week after the tentative agreement was reached, passing by a majority 62% vote. In the contract are several product and employment guarantees stretching well into the next decade. One of GM's key future products, the Chevy Volt, was promised to the GM Poletown/Detroit-Hamtramck plant in 2010. Also included is a VEBA (Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association) which will transfer retiree health care obligations to the UAW by 2010. This eliminates more than 50 billion dollars from GM's healthcare tab. It will be funded by 30 billion in cash and 1.4 billion in GM stock paid to the UAW over the next 4 years of the contract. It also eliminates 70% of the labor cost gap with GM's Japanese rivals.

==== Impact of other strikes ====
A strike at American Axle and Manufacturing Holdings Inc. will result in lost production of an additional 230,000 vehicles in the second quarter, with an estimated $1.8 billion impact on earnings before tax. With a total strike cost of $2.81 billion. <ref>[http://autonewsreport.com/2008/05/23/gms-total-cost-for-axle-strike-281-billion/ GM's Cost - Auto News Report]</ref>

=== 2008 Canadian Auto Workers bargaining===
In an unusual move, [[General Motors of Canada#2008 Canadian Auto Workers bargaining|GM Canada]] and the [[Canadian Auto Workers]] (CAW) union ratified a new collective bargaining contract in May 2008, four months before the expiration of the existing contract.  As part of the agreement, among other production commitments, GM pledged to maintain production at the Oshawa, Ontario pickup truck plant. Less than three weeks later, GM announced that rising gasoline prices and falling truck sales made it necessary to close certain truck and SUV plants, including the [[Oshawa Truck Assembly|Oshawa pickup plant]].<ref>http://media.gm.com/servlet/GatewayServlet?target=http://image.emerald.gm.com/gmnews/viewmonthlyreleasedetail.do?domain=3&docid=46161</ref>  In response, CAW members staged a 12-day blockade of the GM Canada headquarters.  After further discussions with the CAW, GM agreed to compensate workers at the truck plant, as well as making product commitments for the [[Oshawa Car Assembly|Oshawa car assembly plant]].<ref>http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20080728.RGM28/TPStory/Business</ref>

== Auto racing ==
General Motors has an extensive history in numerous forms of racing. Vehicles of most, if not all, of GM's brands have been represented in competition, with perhaps [[Chevrolet]] being the most prominent. In particular, the [[Chevrolet Corvette]] has long been popular and successful in international road racing. GM also is a supplier of racing components, such as engines, transmissions, and electronics.

GM's [[Oldsmobile Aurora]] engine platform was successful in the [[Indy Racing League]] (IRL) throughout the 1990s, winning many races in the small [[V8 engine|V-8]] class. An unmodified Aurora V-8 in the Aerotech, captured 47 world records, including the record for speed endurance in the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America. Recently, the [[Cadillac V-Series]] has entered motorsports racing. GM has also used many cars in the American racing series [[NASCAR]]. Currently the [[Chevrolet Impala]] is the only entry in the series but in the past the [[Pontiac Grand Prix]], [[Buick Regal]], [[Oldsmobile Cutlass]], [[Chevrolet Lumina]],  [[Chevrolet Malibu]], and the [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]] were also used.

In touring cars (mainly in Europe) [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]] is a key player and former champion in the [[British Touring Car Championship]] (BTCC) series and competes with a [[Vauxhall Vectra]] in Super 2000 spec. [[Opel]] used to participate in the [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft|DTM]] series and also in the 1980s in the World Rally Championship and other Rally Series with Group B Spec Opel Manta's before this category of Rallying was banned. [[Chevrolet]] competes with a [[Daewoo Lacetti|Lacetti]] in the [[FIA]] [[World Touring Car Championship]] (WTCC).  Robertshaw Racing also complete with a privately run Lacetti in the BTCC.

In Australia, there is the prestigious [[V8 Supercar]] Championship which is battled out by the two main rivals of [[Holden]] & [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]. The current [[Holden]] Racing Team cars are based on the [[Holden Commodore]] and run a 5.0-litre V8-cylinder engine producing 635+ BHP (approx 467 kW Power). These cars have a top speed of 294 km/h (182 mph) and run 0-100 km/h in 3.8 seconds. The [[Holden Racing Team]] is Australia's most successful team in Australian Touring Car History. In 2007 the Drivers championship was won by the very closely linked [[HSV Dealer Team]]. 

===Development of electronics for GM Auto Racing===
In 1986, the GM Motorsports group asked [[Delco Electronics]] Corporation (DEC), a subsidiary of GM [[Hughes]] Electronics (headquarters - [[Kokomo, Indiana]]) if an electronic engine management system could be developed for the Chevy Indy V8 engines used in the [[CART]] open-wheel race series. Delco Electronics had been supplying all GM automobiles sold in the USA with Engine Control Modules (ECMs) since 1981 when the USA [[Clean Air Act]] required 3-way [[catalytic converters]] and controlled [[air-fuel ratio]]s. The production ECMs were becoming more complex, and were becoming powertrain controllers controlling the transmission, spark timing, Idle speed, as well as air-fuel intake mixtures.

Delco Electronics used a small group of electronic designers and technicians at their facility in [[Goleta, California]] (near [[Santa Barbara, California]]) to do special assignable projects that were advanced or more state of the art. This facility was called Delco Systems Operations (formerly known as GM Defense Research Labs), a part of Delco Electronics Corporation at the time. Delco Systems Operations is the place where the [[Apollo Program]]'s Lunar Rover Mobility Sub-system<ref>Anthony Young, [http://lunarandplanetaryrovers.com/roverbook.htm Lunar and Planetary Rovers: The Wheels of Apollo and the Quest for Mars].
ISBN 0387307745</ref> was developed and built, also the Apollo Program's guidance computers ([[Apollo PGNCS]]) and the [[Boeing 747]] guidance computers ([[Delco Carousel]] IV) were developed and manufactured there. All Delco Electronics Motorsports products developed before 1994 were designed by this group. From 1994 to present, this activity is at Delco Electronics/[[Delphi (auto parts)|Delphi]] in Kokomo, IN.

The first generation of engine management controller for [[CART]] racing used a modified production ECM, but performed poorly in the race car due to the harsh EMI ([[Electromagnetic Interference]]) environment. This version was never used in racing, but the experience gained enabled the engineers to design a more successful Generation 2 controller for use in the 1988 CART IndyCar World series.

[[Image:Mario Illien introduces the Gen II to Mario Andretti.jpg|thumb|Practice at Phoenix 1988. Mario Illien introduces the Gen II to Mario Andretti]]

Generation 2 controllers were used experimentally by [[Newman/Haas/Lanigan Racing|Newman/Haas Racing]] in 1988 and the first win was in the [[Grand Prix of Cleveland|Cleveland GP]] with [[Mario Andretti]] driving.

In 1989 Newman/Haas Racing, [[Penske Racing|Team Penske]], [[Galles Racing]], and [[Patrick Racing]] teams used Delco Electronics Gen-2 controllers with the [[Ilmor]] Chevy Indy V8 engine. "By the start of the 1989 season, racing pundits recognized that Chevrolet, with its Ilmor Engineering engines  and Delco Electronics equipment, had assembled perhaps the most potent racing power in the history of the sport. As the season got under way in April, the pattern of winning began. Racing's elite drivers -- [[Al Unser, Jr.]] and [[Al Unser|Senior]], [[Emerson Fittipaldi]], [[Rick Mears]], Danny Sullivan, and Mario and Michael Andretti -- were driving the best equipment in the world. 

The results began to show early on. By October, Chevy engines with DE equipment had won 13 of the 15 IndyCar races.

When Emerson Fittipaldi crossed the finish line to win the [[1989 Indianapolis 500]], racing fans witnessed history being made. Fans thrilled to the neck-and-neck finish between Fittipaldi and Al Unser, Jr. who went spinning on lap 198 after brushing tires with Emmo, and the 43-year-old Brazilian had his first Indianapolis 500 win. Fittipaldi's victory -- in a Chevrolet Indy V8 engine controlled by a Delco Electronics electronic engine control module (ECM) -- was the first time in the 500's storied history that the engine of the winning vehicle was controlled by an electronic engine management system.<ref>Delco Electronics Electron Magazine, June 1994, pages 1-5</ref> 

[[Image:Gen-2 Conroller that was in the 1989 Indy 500 Winning Car.jpg|thumb|Gen-2 Controller that was in the 1989 Indy 500 Winning Car]]

For the 1990 season, all teams using the Ilmor Chevy Indy V8 were provided a redesigned Gen-3 system and it won 15 poles, 16 wins including the [[1990 Indianapolis 500]], with 17 races in the IndyCar World Series. To prove the system, the components were used with [[GM engines]] in the [[Trans-Am]] Racing series during 1989.

In the 1991 IndyCar World Series, Gen-3 had a perfect score: 17 poles, 17 wins, 17 races including the [[1991 Indianapolis 500]]. At the 1991 Indianapolis 500, Delco Electronics introduced [[telemetry]] to the electronic system using the advanced [[spread spectrum]] radio technology<ref>James Bogner, [http://www.sae.org/technical/papers/962327 SAE paper 962327 : Spread Spectrum Telemetry Data System for Indy Car Racing], October 1996.</ref> . It was so popular that all IndyCar teams eventually used it, and many still use it. [[ABC TV]] used the data from the systems to display real time data with ABC's in-car video cameras.

In 1990 and 1991, the Chevy engine with the Delco Electronics Gen-3 controller won 33 straight IndyCar races. Chevy's dominance proved electronics had found their place in IndyCar racing.

In the 1992 IndyCar World Series, race cars with Gen-3 captured 7 poles, 11 wins  including the [[1992 Indianapolis 500]], in 16 races.

For the 1993 IndyCar World Series, Delco Electronics had been developing a smaller more powerful controller using 32-bit computers and a high-level software language called [[Modula]]-GM. This system was called Gen-4 and won much praise for its improved functions and features.  The telemetry system developed for the 1992 season was used, and a new Distributorless Ignition module component was added to the overall engine management system. 10 wins including the [[1993 Indianapolis 500]] in 16 CART races.

[[Image:Gen-1,Gen-2, Gen-3, Gen-4 Controller Modules Compared.jpg|thumb|Left to Right Gen-4, Gen-3, Gen-2, & Gen-1 Delco Electronics Motorsport Engine Control Modules]]
In 1994, a totally new Ilmor engine was introduced to IndyCar teams and the engine controller was Delco Electronics Gen-4: 12 wins including the [[1994 Indianapolis 500]], 16 races.

In 1995, Gen-4 won 6 races out of 17. 

In 1996, the Indy Racing League split from CART and used the naturally aspirated [[Oldsmobile Aurora]] engine which used the Delco Electronics Gen-4 system until the engine was retired from the IRL [[IndyCar Series]] a few years ago. 1997 was the last year the Gen-4 ran in the CART IndyCar World Series.

Per a February 27, 2003 Delphi Press Release<ref>Delphi's Innovative Earpiece Sensor System Becomes Safety Requirement for Indy Racing League Drivers[http://delphi.wieck.com/pressSingle/value=DEL2005011379901]</ref>, Delphi's current involvement in open wheel racing is as follows:

"Delphi is the official electronics provider to the IRL and has been involved in open-wheel racing since 1988. Today, a majority of the vehicles in the IRL are equipped with several of Delphi's racing products including:

*Delphi Earpiece Sensor System - measures dynamic forces to a driver's head during an accident. It uses small sensors integrated into the left and right radio earpieces worn by the driver. The six accelerometers -- one for each of the three axes on each side -- measure acceleration in the X, Y and Z axes during an accident. The combined data from the earpiece sensor system and onboard accident data recorder provide accident researchers valuable data for a clearer picture of what happens during a crash.

*Accident Data Recorder (ADR2) - senses and records key vehicle parameters at 1,000 samples per second just prior to, during, and after an accident-triggering event.

*Track Condition Radio - helps alert drivers with critical information by transmitting messages from race control to the racecar. A dash-mounted display communicates messages including safety warnings, track condition and pits opened/closed.

*Radio Telemetry Module - transmits engine and chassis data from a speeding racecar to race team engineers located in the pits. The telemetry module helps enhance driver safety and race team strategy by making real-time data available.

*Multec(R) Bottom Feed Methanol Electronic Fuel Injector - provides a high flow rate and a low profile package that are ideal for port fuel racing applications. The injector is able to operate at high temperatures and provide a high level of spray atomization.

*Connectors, Cables and Terminals - connectors are coupling devices that provide an electrical and mechanical connection/disconnection in a system. Cables are insulated electrical conductors. Terminals are devices attached to the end of a wire to facilitate electrical connections. All of these Delphi components enable a vehicle's electrical/electronic system to function under the tough conditions in racing.

Delphi also has begun offering services to the racing industry, including Hydraulic Sled Testing from its state-of-the-art testing laboratory in Vandalia, Ohio. Delphi provides comprehensive safety testing using a hydraulic test sled to simulate a crash. Services include on-board data acquisition, on- and off-board digital video monitoring and the use of Delphi safety products such as the earpiece sensor system and accident data recorder."

==Alternative fuels and hybrids==
General Motors is both active in environmental causes and, as a major industrial force, implicated in ecologically harmful activity. The company has long worked on alternative-technology vehicles, and has recently led the industry with clean burning Flexfuel vehicles that can run on either [[E85]] (ethanol) or [[gasoline]]. The company was the first to use [[turbocharger]]s and was an early proponent of [[V6 engine]]s in the 1960s, but quickly lost interest as the [[muscle car]] race took hold. They demonstrated <ref>[http://www.conklinsystems.com/firebird/mlife.php America's First Turbine Car]</ref> [[gas turbine]] vehicles powered by [[kerosene]], an area of interest throughout the industry, but abandoned the alternative engine configuration in view of the [[1973 oil crisis]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, GM pushed the benefits of [[diesel]] engines and [[cylinder deactivation]] technologies with disastrous results due to poor durability in the [[Oldsmobile]] diesels and drivability issues in the [[Cadillac]] V8-6-4 variable cylinder engines. In 1987 GM, in conjunction with [[Aerovironment]] built the [[Sunraycer]] which won the inaugural [[World Solar Challenge]] and was a showcase of advanced technology. Much of the technology from Sunraycer found its way into the Impact prototype electric vehicle (also built by Aerovironment) and was the predecessor to the [[General Motors EV1|EV1]].

GM supported a compromise version of the [[CAFE]] standard increase from 27 mpg to 35 mpg, the first such increase in over 20 years.<ref>[http://www.kpcnews.com/articles/2007/07/27/greater_fort_wayne/news/doc46a9e1f76229a445366384.txt GM workers lobbying for less-stringent CAFE rule<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref> 
====Hybrid initiative====
{{Main|Plug-in hybrid|Chevrolet Volt}}

In May 2004, GM delivered the world's first full sized hybrid pickups, and introduced a hybrid passenger car. In 2005, the [[Opel Astra]] [[diesel]] [[hybrid vehicle|Hybrid]] [[concept vehicle]] was introduced. The 2006 [[Saturn Vue#Green Line|Saturn Vue Green Line]] was the first hybrid passenger vehicle from GM and is also a mild design. GM has hinted at new hybrid technologies to be employed that will be optimized for higher speeds in [[freeway]] driving. Future hybrid vehicles should include the 2007 [[Chevrolet Tahoe|GMC Yukon]], the [[Saturn Aura#Aura Green Line|Saturn Aura]], and an updated [[Saturn Vue#Second Generation|Saturn Vue]] based an [[Opel]] design like the Saturn Aura. 

GM has recently introduced the concept cars  [[Chevrolet Volt]] and [[Opel Flextreme]], which are electric vehicles with back-up generators, powered by gasoline, E85, or fuel cells. According to GM, a production Chevrolet Volt will be available by late 2010 as a 2011 model.

GM currently offers two types of hybrid systems. The first type, used in the Silverado Hybrid, Saturn Vue, Saturn Aura, and Chevrolet Malibu, is what GM calls a "[[mild hybrid|Mild Hybrid]]" or "BAS" system. The second hybrid drive system,co-developed with [[DaimlerChrysler]] and [[BMW]], is called a "[[Two-Mode Hybrid]]."  The two-mode is used by the Chevrolet Tahoe/GMC Yukon and will later be used on the Saturn Vue, and possibly other vehicles.<ref>Tom Higgs, [http://www.mycar.net/gm "Patents General Motors"].

GM sold 843 hybrids of all types during the first quarter of 2008, according to the industry newspaper ''[[Automotive News]]''.  Compared that with Ford, which sold 5,225 hybrids during that time. The hands-down hybrid leader, Toyota, sold 278,000 in the U.S. alone last year and 430,000 worldwide. CSM Worldwide, expects GM to seriously increase its hybrid output, turning the automaker into a serious contender within the next few years. He expects it to produce 40,000 to 50,000 hybrids this year, more than doubling last year's production.<ref>Valdes-Dapena, Peter [http://www6.lexisnexis.com/publisher/EndUser?Action=UserDisplayFullDocument&orgId=101846&topicId=104970025&docId=l:780869115 GM gets on the hybrid highway], CNNMoney, April 23, 2008, retrieved 2008-07-06</ref>

====Hydrogen initiative====
GM has prided its research and prototype development of [[hydrogen vehicle|hydrogen powered vehicles]], to be produced in early 2010, using a support infrastructure still in a prototype state. The economic feasibility of the technically challenging hydrogen car, and the low-cost production of hydrogen to fuel it, has also been discussed by other automobile manufacturers such as [[Ford]] and [[Chrysler]]. In June 2007, Larry Burns, vice president of research and development, said he's not yet willing to say exactly when hydrogen vehicles will be mass produced, but he said it should happen before 2020, the year many experts have predicted. He said "I sure would be disappointed if we weren't there" before 2020.<ref>Tom Krisher, [http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D8PP9U4G0.htm "GM steps up work on hydrogen cars"], ''[[Business Week]]''. June 15, 2007</ref>

====[[Flexfuel]] and [[Biofuel]]s====  
GM produces many Flexfuel vehicles that can operate on ethanol gasoline, or [[E85]]. GM is the leader in E85 FlexFuel vehicles, with over 3 million FlexFuel vehicles on the road in the U.S. E85 is a mostly renewable fuel made from corn and grain products.<ref>[http://www.gm.com/explore/fuel_economy/e85/index.jsp?deep=what General Motors | Fuel Economy & Alternative Fuels - E85 Ethanol]</ref>

By the end of 2008, GM will offer 25 ethanol-enabled FlexFuel cars and trucks around the world, and produce more than one million new FlexFuel vehicles.<ref>[http://www.gm.com/corporate/investor_information/docs/fin_data/gm07ar/content/letter/letter_02.html General Motors 2007 Annual Report | Page 2 of 4]</ref> GM's goal is to have half of their annual vehicle production be E85 or biodiesel capable by 2012.

====Electric vehicles====
{{main|General Motors EV1}}  
The process of obtaining the [[General Motors EV1|EV1]], GM's first electric vehicle, was difficult. The vehicle could not be purchased outright. Instead, General Motors offered a closed-end lease for three years, with no renewal or residual purchase options.   The EV1 was only available from specialist Saturn dealerships, and only in California and Arizona.<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/general-motors-ev1 General Motors EV1: Information and Much More from Answers.com<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref> Before reviewing leasing options, a potential lessee would be taken through a 'pre-qualification' process in order to learn how the EV1 was different from other vehicles. Next came a waiting list with no scheduled delivery date.<ref>[http://pages.prodigy.net/noela/myev.htm My EV experiences<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref>

In June 2006 the documentary ''[[Who Killed the Electric Car?]]'' was released, criticizing among others, GM for being responsible for the demise of the EV1.  Several weeks before the debut of the movie, the [[Smithsonian Institution]] announced that its EV1 display was being permanently removed and the EV1 car put into storage. GM is a major financial contributor to the museum, but both parties denied that this fact contributed to the removal of the display.<ref>[http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/06/smithsonian_kills.php Smithsonian Kills the Electric Car]. Retrieved on 2008-05-19.</ref>

General Motors has responded to complaints about the scrapping of the EV1 program and they dispute the existence of any conspiracy surrounding its demise. An entry was posted on the GM blog [http://fastlane.gmblogs.com/ FastLane] in 2006 in which GM defended its decision by saying that it was unable to guarantee the vehicles could continue to be maintained in a safe operating state.<ref name = "kpybzs">[http://fyi.gmblogs.com/2006/06/who_ignored_the_facts_about_th.html GM FYI Blog: Who Ignored the Facts About the Electric Car?<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref>  

GM alleges that during the four years available to the public, only 800 EV1's were released. Over $1 billion was spent on the EV1 program, with a great portion used for consumer incentives and marketing. With a waiting list of 5,000 applicants, only 50 individuals actually were willing to accept a lease on the EV1. Suppliers ceased production of replacement parts due to the low demand for the EV1. This made repairs and continued safety of the vehicles difficult. The EV1 was designed as a developmental vehicle and was never intended for serial production. 

The limitations of storage technology and the expense of production would have made the cars impractical for the vast majority of consumers;{{Fact|date=December 2008}} a production EV1 would have met limited demand and would have been priced out of reach of most.{{Fact|date=December 2008}} Had sufficient demand existed to justify mass production and had costs and technologies been able to support mass production, GM would have been more receptive to the idea.{{Fact|date=December 2008}} 

GM responded to allegations made in the film through a blog post by Dave Barthmuss, who said "Sadly, despite the substantial investment of money and the enthusiastic fervor of a relatively small number of EV1 drivers — including the filmmaker — the EV1 proved far from a viable commercial success."<ref>[http://fyi.gmblogs.com/2006/06/who_ignored_the_facts_about_th.html ''Who Ignored the Facts About the Electric Car?'']</ref> Barthmuss notes investments in electric vehicle technology since the EV1: [[Two-Mode Hybrid]], plug-in hybrid, and fuel cell vehicle programs. The filmmakers suggested that GM did not immediately channel its technological progress with the EV1 into these projects, and instead let the technology languish while focusing on more immediately profitable enterprises such as SUVs. Contrary to this suggestion, as Barthmuss points out, GM is bullish on hydrogen:

According to GM, not all of the EV1's were destroyed. Many were donated to research institutions and facilities, along with museums. Some are still owned by General Motors themselves, and are kept at their technical design center in [[Warren, Michigan]], and can occasionally be seen on the road within a closed area of the tech center.<ref name = "kpybzs"/>

On September 16, 2008, as part of its 100th anniversary celebration, GM unveiled the "production" version of the Chevrolet Volt at the GM headquarters in Detroit[http://media.gm.com/servlet/GatewayServlet?target=http://image.emerald.gm.com/gmnews/viewpressreldetail.do?domain=827&docid=48589].

==Political and charitable contributions==
In the 2006 election cycle General Motors contributed $788,600, with 34% of that amount going to the Democrats and 66% to the Republicans.<ref>[http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/contrib.asp?Ind=M02 Top Contributors to Federal Candidates and Parties: Automotive<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref> Since 1996, General Motors has been the exclusive source of funding for [[Safe Kids USA]]'s "Safe Kids Buckle Up" program, a national initiative to ensure child automobile safety through education and inspection.<ref>Safe Kids USA.

== Corporate restructuring ==
After gaining market share in the late 1990s and making enormous profits General Motors stock soared to over $80 a share. However, in 2000, twelve successive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve led to a severe stock market decline following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], caused a pension and benefit funds crisis at General Motors and many other American companies. General Motors' rising retiree health care costs and Other Post Employment Benefit (OPEB) fund deficit prompted the company to enact a broad restructuring plan. Although GM had already taken action to fully fund its pension plan, its OPEB fund became an issue for its corporate bond ratings. GM had expressed its disagreement with the bond ratings; moreover, GM's benefit funds were performing at higher than expected rates of return. Then, following a $10.6 billion loss in 2005, GM acted quickly to implement its restructuring plan. For the first quarter of 2006 GM earned $400 million, signaling a turnaround had already begun even though many aspects of the restructuring plan had not yet taken effect. Although retiree health care costs remain a significant issue, General Motors' investment strategy has generated a $17.1 billion surplus in 2007 in its $101 billion U.S. pension fund portfolio, a $35 billion reversal from its $17.8 billion of underfunding.<ref name = "qvoyrs"/>

In February 2005, GM successfully bought itself out of a put option with [[Fiat]] for $2 billion USD (€1.55 billion). In 2000, GM had sold a 6% stake to Fiat in return for a 20% share in the Italian automaker. As part of the deal, GM granted Fiat a [[put option]] which, if exercised between January 2004 and July 2009, could have forced GM to buy Fiat. GM had agreed to the put option at the time, perhaps to keep it from being acquired by another automaker such as [[Daimler AG]] competing with GM's [[Opel]] and [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]] marques. The relationship suffered, and Fiat had failed to improve. In 2003, Fiat recapitalized, reducing GM's stake to 10%. 

In February 2006, GM slashed its annual dividend from 2.00 to $1.00 per share. The reduction saved $565 million a year. 

In March 2006, GM divested 92.36 million shares (reducing their stake from 20% to 3%) of Japanese manufacturer [[Suzuki]], in order to raise $2.3 billion. GM originally invested in [[Suzuki]] in the early 1980s. 

On March 23, 2006, a private equity consortium including [[KKR]], [[Goldman Sachs]] Capital, and [[Five Mile Capital]] purchased $8.8 billion, or 78% of [[GMAC]], GM's commercial mortgage arm. 
The new entity, in which GMAC will own a 21% stake, will be known as Capmark Financial Group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060323/NEWS11/60323002|work=[[Detroit Free Press]]|title=article|accessmonthday=March 23 |accessyear=2006}}</ref>

On April 3, 2006, GM announced that it would sell 51% of GMAC as a whole to a consortium led by [[Cerberus Capital Management]], raising $14 billion over 3 years. Investors also include [[Citigroup]]'s private equity arm and [[Aozora Bank]] of Japan. The group will pay GM $7.4 billion in cash at closing. GM will retain approximately $20 billion in automobile financing worth an estimated $4 billion over three years.

GM sold its 8% stake in [[Isuzu]] on April 11, 2006, to raise an additional $300 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060411/UPDATE/604110423/1148/AUTO01 |title=GM sells Isuzu shares for $300 million|work=[[Detroit News]] |accessdate=2006-04-12}}</ref>12,600 workers from [[Delphi (auto parts)|Delphi]], a key supplier to GM, agreed to buyouts and an early retirement plan offered by GM in order to avoid a strike, after a judge agreed to cancel Delphi's union contracts. 5,000 Delphi workers were allowed to flow to GM.

On June 28, 2007, GM agreed to sell its [[Allison Transmission]] division to [[private-equity]] firms [[Carlyle Group]] and [[Onex Corporation|Onex]] for $5.1 billion. The deal will increase GM's [[liquidity]] and echoes previous moves to shift its focus towards its core automotive business. The two firms will control seven factories around Indianapolis but GM will retain management of a factory in [[Baltimore]]. Former Allison Transmission president [[Lawrence E. Dewey]] will be the new CEO of the standalone company.<ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118303669648651430-search.html?KEYWORDS=gm+allison&COLLECTION=wsjie/6month GM Agrees to Sell Allison Transmission Unit], [[The Wall Street Journal]], June 29, 2007</ref>

On February 12, 2008 GM announced its loss of $39 billion, the biggest loss of any U.S. automaker. GM has offered buyouts to all its UAW members.

In March 24, 2008 GM reported a cash position of $24 billion, or $6 billion less than what was on hand September 31, 2007, which is a loss of $1 billion dollars a month. <ref>[http://autonewsreport.com/2008/05/29/gm-cash-burn-1b-per-month/ GM Cash Burn 1B per month] - Auto News Report - May 29, 2008</ref> A further quarterly loss of $15.5 billion, the third-biggest in the company's history, was announced on August 1, 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=au.TL_ofjGuM&refer=home|title=GM's $15.5 Billion Loss Is Third-Biggest in a Century|last=Bensinger|first=Greg|coauthors=Green, Jeff|date=August 1, 2008|work=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|accessdate=2008-08-02}}</ref>

On November 18, 2008, General Motors together with [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[Chrysler]], sought financial aid at a Congressional hearing in [[Washington D.C.]] in the face of worsening conditions caused by the [[automotive industry crisis of 2008|automotive industry crisis]]. All three companies were unsuccessful and were invited to draft a new action plan for the sustainability of the industry.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/19/business/19auto.html?_r=1&em Detroit Chiefs Plead for Aid. New York Times on November 18, 2008.] Retrieved November 21, 2008.</ref> On December 2, 2008, General Motors submitted its "Restructuring Plan for Long-Term Viability" to the Senate Banking Committee and House of Representatives Financial Services Committee. <ref>[http://www.house.gov/apps/list/press/financialsvcs_dem/gm.pdf Restructuring Plan for Long-Term Viability]</ref>

==Disability assistance==
The GM Mobility program was launched in 1991 to assist people with disabilities with their transportation needs. The Mobility program provides financial assistance, plus two extra years of the OnStar safety and security service. This applies when one or more of the 35 eligible aftermarket mobility equipment modifications are installed on the vehicle (i.e., hand controls, scooter hoists or wheelchair lifts). All GM brands (Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC, HUMMER, Pontiac, Saab and Saturn) are included in the program.

==Criticism==
===GM Scrutinized for Alleged Nazi Collaboration===

In August 1938,  a senior executive for General Motors, James Mooney, received the Grand Cross of the German Eagle for his distinguished service to the Reich. Hitler "would never have considered invading Poland" without synthetic fuel technology provided by General Motors. <ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/nov98/nazicars30.htm]</ref>,<ref>http://www.internalcombustionbook.com/archive/offsite/jweekly/JWeeklyGMandtheNazis.html</ref>

===Deliberate dismantlement of urban rail infrastructure===
{{seealso|Great American streetcar scandal}}

Facing a saturated car market in the US in the early 1920s GM engaged in in a controversial policy along with road-builders that triggered the massive shift from the mass transportation of the previous century to the 'one-person-one-car' trip of today.<ref>[http://www.sustainabletimes.ca/articles/greencars.htm Stephen Leahy, ''Time Expired'']</ref>
In order to expand auto sales and maximize profits GM bought local mass transit systems and privately-owned railways, following which it would proceed to eliminate them.<ref>[http://www.lovearth.net/gmdeliberatelydestroyed.htm Bradford Snell, ''The StreetCar Conspiracy. How General Motors Deliberately Destroyed Public Transit'']</ref> 

In 1996 documentary ''[[Taken for a Ride]]'', GM is cited as being mastermind of purchase and destruction of private fixed rail transit systems in US cities from 1920s until 1950s.
The documentary claims the motivations were to eliminate fixed rail systems and implement the idea of buses and cars as more efficient and better alternatives in order to increase GM sales.

===Top-level management===
In 1980, J. Patrick Wright wrote a book named ''On a Clear Day You Can See General Motors.'' This book, which critics acclaimed "blows the lid off the king of carmakers" was about the allegations of corruption, "mismanagement and total irresponsibility" at the top level of the company, as seen by [[John DeLorean|John Z. DeLorean]], the Vice-President, who in 1973 resigned from his position in spite of a brilliant and meteoric rise (he was earning $ 650,000 per year and was expected to be the next President of GM).

In 2008, during the economic downturn, GM entered into discussions for a possible takeover of Chrysler, LLC. in exchange for its 49% stake in GMAC with Cerberus. This was met with criticism.

===Electric car issues===
In June 2006 the documentary ''[[Who Killed the Electric Car?]]'' was released, criticizing GM, among others, for the cancellation of its first electric car, the [[General Motors EV1|EV1]].  It should be noted that with the introduction of the production [[Chevrolet Volt]], Chris Paine, director of the documentary, has shown substantial affinity for General Motors.  The sequel to the documentary, to be titled ''Revenge of the Electric Car'' is expected to portray a less antagonistic view of General Motors. <ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/news/3441346/General-Motors-end-of-the-road.html]</ref>

Many have criticized GM for ignoring larger environmental issues across their entire fleet and using the Chevy Volt merely to green wash their tarnished image.  The planned first year production is only 10,000 vehicles.<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/22/business/22volt.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=chevrolet%20volt&st=cse G.M.’s Latest Great Green Hope Is a Tall Order</ref>
