'''[[Poverty]] in [[the United States]]''' refers to people living in poverty in the U.S. Within the U.S. the most common measure of poverty is the "[[poverty threshold|poverty line]]" set by the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]], which recognizes poverty as lacking those goods and services commonly taken for granted by members of mainstream society.<ref name="Schwartz">Schwartz, J.

Those under the age of 18 were the most likely to be impoverished. In 2006 the poverty rate for minors in the United States was the highest in the industrialized world, with 21.9% of all minors and 30% of African American minors living below the poverty threshold.<ref>[http://www.epinet.org/content.cfm/webfeatures_snapshots_20060719 U.S. Government Does Relatively Little to Lessen Child Poverty Rates]</ref> Moreover, the standard of living for those in the bottom 10% was lower in the U.S. than other developed nations except the United Kingdom, which has the lowest standard of living for impoverished children in the developed world.<ref name="Marriages, Families & Intimate Relationships">{{cite book | last = Williams | first = Brian | authorlink = | coauthors = Stacey C.

==Measures of poverty==
Measures of poverty can be either absolute or relative. 

===The official measure of poverty===
[[Image:Poverty 59 to 05.png|thumb|400px|Percent and number below the poverty threshold.<ref name = "US Census Bureau, report on income, poverty and insurance for 2005"/>]]
[[Image:Homeless - American Flag.jpg|thumb|250px|People who experience  homelessness make poverty more visible in the United States.]]

There are two basic versions of the federal poverty measure: the poverty thresholds (which are the primary version) and the poverty guidelines. The [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau]] issues the poverty thresholds, which are generally used for statistical purposes&mdash;for example, to estimate the number of people in poverty nationwide each year and classify them by type of residence, race, and other social, economic, and demographic characteristics. The [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] issues the poverty guidelines for administrative purposes&mdash;for instance, to determine whether a person or family is eligible for assistance through various federal programs.<ref>Fisher, G.M. (2003) [http://www.census.gov/hhes/poverty/povmeas/papers/orshansky.html The Development of the Orshansky Poverty Thresholds]. Accessed: 2003-12-27</ref>

Since the 1960s, the United States Government has defined poverty in absolute terms.  When the [[Lyndon Johnson|Johnson]] administration declared "[[war on poverty]]" in 1964, it chose an absolute measure.  The "absolute poverty line" is the threshold below which families or individuals are considered to be ''lacking the resources to meet the basic needs for healthy living; having insufficient income to provide the food, shelter and clothing needed to preserve health.''

The "Orshansky Poverty Thresholds" form the basis for the current measure of poverty in the U.S.  [[Mollie Orshansky]] was an economist working for the [[Social Security Administration]] (SSA).  Her work appeared at an opportune moment.   Orshansky's article was published later in the same year that Johnson declared war on poverty.  Since her measure was absolute (i.e., did not depend on other events), it made it possible to objectively answer whether the U.S. government was "winning" this war.  The newly formed [[United States Office of Economic Opportunity]] adopted the lower of the Orshansky poverty thresholds for statistical, planning, and budgetary purposes in May 1965. 

The Bureau of the Budget (now the [[Office of Management and Budget]]) adopted Orshansky's definition for statistical use in all Executive departments in 1965. The measure gave a range of income cutoffs, or thresholds, adjusted for factors such as family size, sex of the family head, number of children under 18 years old, and farm or non-farm residence.  The economy food plan (the least costly of four nutritionally adequate food plans designed by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]]) was at the core of this definition of poverty.<ref name=census>[http://www.census.gov/hhes/income/defs/poverty.html Poverty Definition] U.S. Census Bureau. Accessed: 2003-12-27.</ref> 

The Department of Agriculture found that families of three or more persons spent about one third of their after-tax income on food.  For these families, poverty thresholds were set at three times the cost of the economy food plan.  Different procedures were used for calculating poverty thresholds for two-person households and persons living alone.  Annual updates of the SSA poverty thresholds were based on price changes in the economy food plan.   

Two changes were made to the poverty definition in 1969.  Thresholds for non-farm families were tied to annual changes in the [[Consumer Price Index]] (CPI) rather than changes in the cost of the economy food plan.  Farm thresholds were raised from 70 to 85% of the non-farm levels.

In 1981, further changes were made to the poverty definition.  Separate thresholds for "farm" and "female-householder" families were eliminated.  The largest family size category became "nine persons or more."<ref name=census />

Apart from these changes, the U.S. government's approach to measuring poverty has remained static for the past forty years. 

However, there are reasons to believe that the official government numbers greatly exaggerate the extent of poverty: Sociologists and researchers who have looked beyond official income figures by actually interviewing real poor people have found that many people officially classified by income as "poor" actually have significant unreported sources of income, usually in the underground economy, incomes that indicate they are not by any means in poverty.  In addition, a significant increase in the poverty stats consists of poor people coming into the United States from other countries--people whose poverty originated in other countries. Given this, and given that about one third of all people in poverty are actually only temporarily in poverty (for instance college students temporarily poor while getting their degrees and preparing for successful careers in the future), many scholars estimate that the actual number of U.S. citizens suffering from long-term poverty is probably around 4 percent (four percent) of the general population--a number which compares favorably to Africa (with about 90% in long term poverty), China (with maybe 75 percent in long term poverty), and so on.  
===Recent poverty rate and guidelines===
The official poverty rate in the U.S. increased for four consecutive years, from a 26-year low of 11.3% in 2000 to 12.7% in 2004, then declined somewhat to 12.3% in 2006.  This means that 36.5 million people (approx 1 in 8 Americans) were below the official poverty thresholds in 2006, compared to 31.1 million in 2000<ref>[http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/2001/cb01-158.html "Nation's Household Income Stable in 2000, Poverty Rate Virtually Equals Record Low, Census Bureau Reports"], 10 October, 2001, census.gov.</ref>, and that there was an increase of 5.4 million poor from 2000 to 2006 while the total population grew by 17.5{{Fact|date=October 2007}} million. <ref>{{cite web | title=www.census.gov/ps | work=Poverty Status of People by Family Relationship, Race, and Hispanic Origin: 1959 to 2006 | url=http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/histpov/hstpov2.html | accessmonthday=September 08 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>  The poverty rate for children under 18 years old increased from 16.2% to 17.8% from 2000 to 2004 and had dropped to 17.4% in 2005 and 2006. <ref>{{cite web | title=www.census.gov/h | work=Poverty:2006 highlights | url=http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/poverty06/pov06hi.html | accessmonthday=September 08 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

===Relative measures of poverty=== 
[[Image:Poverty by Age.png|thumb|400px|The poverty rate for selected age groups. Those under the age of 18 are most likely to fall below the poverty threshold.<ref name="US Census Bureau, report on income, poverty and insurance for 2005">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/prod/2006pubs/p60-231.pdf|title=US Census Bureau, report on income, poverty and insurance for 2005|accessdate=2006-01-19}}</ref>]]
Another way of looking at poverty is in ''relative'' terms. "Relative poverty" can be defined as ''having significantly less access to income and wealth than other members of society.''  Therefore, the relative poverty rate can directly be linked to income inequality. When the standard of living among those in more financially advantageous positions rises while that of those considered poor stagnates, the relative poverty rate will reflect such growing income inequality and increase. Conversely, the poverty rate can ''decrease,'' with low income people coming to have less wealth and income if wealthier people's wealth is reduced by a larger percentage than theirs. In 1959, a family at the poverty line had an income that was 42.64% of the median income. Thus, a poor family in 1999 had ''relatively'' less income and therefore ''relatively'' less purchasing power than wealthier members of society in 1959, and, therefore, "poverty" had increased. But, because this is a relative measure, this is not saying that a family in 1999 with the same amount of wealth and income as a family from 1959 had less purchasing power than the 1959 family.

In the EU, "relative poverty" is defined as an income below 60% of the national [[median]] equalized [[disposable income]] after social transfers for a comparable household. In Germany, for example, the official relative poverty line for a single adult person in 2003 was 938 euros per month (11,256 euros/year, $12,382 PPP. West Germany 974 euros/month, 11,688 euros/year, $12,857 PPP). For a family of four with two children below 14 years the poverty line was 1969.8 euros per month ($2,167 PPP) or 23,640 euros ($26,004 PPP) per year. According to [[Eurostat]] the percentage of people in Germany living at risk of poverty (relative poverty) in 2004 was 16% (official national rate 13.5% in 2003). Additional definitions for poverty in Germany are "poverty" (50% median) and "strict poverty" (40% median, national rate 1.9% in 2003). Generally the percentage for "relative poverty" is much higher than the quota for "strict poverty". The U.S concept is best comparable to "strict poverty". By European standards the official (relative) poverty rate in the United States would be significantly higher than it is by the U.S. measure. A research paper from the [[OECD]] calculates the relative poverty rate for the United States at 16% for 50% median of disposable income and nearly 24% for 60% of median disposable income<ref name="Michael Foerster/Marco Mira d'Ercole">Michael Foerster/Marco Mira d'Ercole, "Income Distribution and Poverty in OECD Countries in the Second Half of the 1990s", OECD Social, employment and migration working papers No. 22, Paris 2005, page 22, figure 6. </ref> (OECD average: 11% for 50% median, 16% for 60% median).

=== The income distribution and relative poverty ===
Although the relative approach theoretically differs largely from the Orshansky definition, crucial variables of both poverty definitions are more similar than often thought. First, the so-called standardization of income in both approaches is very similar. To make incomes comparable among households of different sizes, [[equivalence scales]] are used to standardize household income to the level of a single person household. In Europe, the modified [[OECD]] equivalence scale is used, which takes the combined value of 1 for the head of household, 0.5 for each additional household member older than 14 years and 0.3 for children. When compared to the US Census poverty lines, which is based on a defined basket of goods, for the most prevalent household types both standardization methods show to be very similar. 

Secondly, if the  of the poverty threshold in Western-European countries is not always higher than the Orshansky threshold for a single person family. The actual Orchinsky poverty line for single person households in the US ($9645 in 2004) is very comparable to the relative poverty line in many Western-European countries (Belgium 2004: €9315), while price levels are also similar.  The reason why relative poverty measurement causes high poverty levels in the US, as demonstrated by Förster<ref name="Michael Foerster/Marco Mira d'Ercole">Michael Foerster/Marco Mira d'Ercole, "Income Distribution and Poverty in OECD Countries in the Second Half of the 1990s", OECD Social, employment and migration working papers No. 22, Paris 2005, page 22, figure 6. </ref>, is caused by distributional effects rather than real differences in wellbeing among EU-countries and the USA. The median household income is much higher in the US than in Europe due to the wealth of the middle classes in the US, from which the poverty line is derived. Although the paradigm of relative poverty is most valuable, this comparison of poverty lines show that the higher prevalence of relative poverty levels in the US are not an indicator of a more severe poverty problem but an indicator of larger inequalities between rich middle classes and the low-income households. It is therefore not correct to state that the US income distribution is characterised by a large proportion of households in poverty; it is characterized by relatively large income inequality but also high levels of prosperity of the middle classes. The 2007 poverty threshold for a three member family is 17,070.'''

==Human Poverty Index==
The [[United Nations Development Programme]], uses the human poverty index in order to assess the development with regards to poverty among OECD countries. The index takes the likelihood of a child not surviving to age 60, [[functional illiteracy]] rate, long-term unemployment and the population living on less than 50% of the median national income into account. While the United States has one of the second lowest long-term unemployment rates in the developed world, it has the highest percentage of children who are not likely to live to age 60 and persons living on less than 50% of the national median income and the third highest percentage of adults lacking functional literacy skills.

==Food security==
Eighty-nine percent of American households were food secure throughout the entire year 2002, meaning that they had access, at all times, to enough food for an active, healthy life for all household members. The remaining households were food insecure at least some time during that year. The prevalence of food insecurity rose from 10.7% in 2001 to 11.1% in 2002, and the prevalence of food insecurity with hunger rose from 3.3% to 3.5%. These numbers are largely meaningless, however, since they include people who claim to have been food insecure for one day of the year. <ref>[http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/fanrr35/fanrr35.pdf Household Food Security in the United States, 2002] - United States Department of Agriculture</ref>

== Causes of poverty ==
There are numerous perceived direct and indirect causes of [[poverty]] in the [[United States]]. They include:
===Parents not married===
In 2005, [[African American]] economist [[Walter E. Williams]], of [[George Mason University]], wrote:
{{cquote
|Let's examine some numbers readily available from the Census Bureau's 2004 Current Population Survey... There's one segment of the black population that suffers only a 9.9 percent poverty rate, and only 13.7 percent of its under-5-year-olds are poor. There's another segment that suffers a 39.5 percent poverty rate, and 58.1 percent of its under-5-year-olds are poor. Among whites, one segment suffers a 6 percent poverty rate, and only 9.9 percent of its under-5-year-olds are poor. The other segment suffers a 26.4 percent poverty rate, and 52 percent of its under-5-year-olds are poor... The only distinction between both the black and white populations is marriage — lower poverty in married-couple families. <ref>[http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/williams102705.asp  Ammunition for poverty pimps] Walter E. Williams, October 27, 2005</ref>}}

In a February 7, 2008 column, [[African American]] economist [[Thomas Sowell]] wrote, "The poverty rate among black married couples has been in single digits since 1994."<ref>[http://jewishworldreview.com/cols/sowell020708.php3 Economics, anyone?] Thomas Sowell, February 7, 2008</ref>

In a [[January 15]], [[2003]] article titled "How Not to Be Poor," Blake Bailey wrote, "Don't Have Children Out of Wedlock... Children born to parents who do not marry spend, on average, 56.7 percent of their lives in poverty as opposed to just 6.3 percent for children in married families." <ref>[http://www.ncpa.org/pub/ba/ba428/ How Not to Be Poor]</ref>

===Excessive levels of taxation and regulation===
A May 16, 2006 editorial in the [[Wall St. Journal]] stated, "The Pacific Research Institute has crunched the tax numbers in all 50 states and published the 'U.S. Economic Freedom Index' ranking all states according to how friendly or unfriendly their policies were toward free enterprise... In 2005, per capita personal income grew 31% faster in the 15 most economically free states than it did in the 15 states at the bottom of the list. And employment growth was a staggering 216% higher in the most free states." <ref>[http://www.opinionjournal.com/federation/feature/?id=110008350 'Live Free or Move'], Wall St. Journal, May 16, 2006</ref>
===Closed shop policies===
A March 3, 2008 editorial in the [[Wall St. Journal]] stated, "There's no doubt times are tough in Ohio. The state has lost 200,000 manufacturing jobs since 2000... Meanwhile, the Texas economy has boomed since 2004, with nearly twice the rate of new job creation as the rest of the nation... Ohio, Indiana and Michigan are losing auto jobs, but many of these 'runaway plants' are not fleeing to China, Mexico or India. They've moved to more business-friendly U.S. states, including Texas... Ohio's most crippling handicap may be that its politicians -- and thus its employers -- are still in the grip of such industrial unions as the United Auto Workers. Ohio is a '[[closed shop]]' state, which means workers can be forced to join a union whether they wish to or not. Many companies -- especially foreign-owned -- say they will not even consider such locations for new sites. States with '[[Right-to-work law|right to work]]' laws that make union organizing more difficult had twice the job growth of Ohio and other forced union states from 1995-2005, according to the National Institute for Labor Relations... Texas is a right to work state and has been adding jobs by the tens of thousands. Nearly 1,000 new plants have been built in Texas since 2005, from the likes of Microsoft, Samsung and Fujitsu." <ref>[http://online.wsj.com/public/article_print/SB120450306595906431.html Texas v. Ohio], Wall St. Journal, March 3, 2008</ref>

===Heavily funded, but badly run public schools===
According to a 2005 report from the [[OECD]], the United States is tied for first place with Switzerland when it comes to annual spending per student on its public schools, with each of those two countries spending more than $11,000 (in U.S. currency). [http://www.oecd.org/document/34/0,2340,en_2649_201185_35341645_1_1_1_1,00.html] 
Despite this high level of funding, U.S. public schools lag behind the schools of other rich countries in the areas of reading, math, and science. [http://www.siteselection.com/ssinsider/snapshot/sf011210.htm] 

According to a 2007 article in [[The Washington Post]], the Washington D.C. public school district spends $12,979 per student per year. This is the third highest level of funding per student out of the 100 biggest school districts in the U.S. Despite this high level of funding, the school district provides outcomes that are lower than the national average. In reading and math, the district's students score the lowest among 11 major school districts - even when poor children are compared only with other poor children. 33% of poor fourth graders in the U.S. lack basic skills in math, but in Washington D.C., it's 62%. [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/09/AR2007060901415.html?hpid=topnews]

According to a 2006 study by the [[Goldwater Institute]], Arizona's public schools spend 50% more per student than Arizona's private schools. The study also says that while teachers constitute 72% of the employees at private schools, they make up less than half of the staff at public schools. According to the study, if Arizona's public schools wanted to be like private schools, they would have to hire approximately 25,000 more teachers, and eliminate 21,210 administration employees. The study also said that public school teachers are paid about 50% more than private school teachers. [http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2006/10/18/private-schools-now-33-off/]

In 1985 in Kansas City, Missouri, a judge ordered the school district to raise taxes and spend more money on public education. Spending was increased so much, that the school district was spending more money per student than any of the country's other 280 largest school districts. Although this very high level of spending continued for more than a decade, there was no improvement in the school district's academic performance. [http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa-298.html] [http://www.amren.com/9512issue/9512issue.html]

According to a 1999 article by [[William J. Bennett]], former U.S. Secretary of Education, increased levels of spending on public education have not made the schools better. Among many other things, the article cites the following statisitcs: [http://www.heartland.org/Article.cfm?artId=11200]

*  Between 1960 and 1995, U.S. public school spending per student, adjusted for inflation, increased by 212%.

* In 1994, less than half of all U.S. public school employees were teachers.

* Out of 21 industrialized countries, U.S. 12th graders ranked 19th in math, 16th in science, and last in advanced physics.

Some poverty in the United States is the result of social institutions which contribute to and sustain poverty. <ref name = Marger>{{cite book

1. Don't drop out of school.
2. Don't have children before marriage. 
3. Work at a job, any job, don't quit. 

Sawhill's research shows that most poverty today is the result of either dropping out of high school, having children before marriage, and refusing to work at available jobs. In short, to poor life choices. 

Other causes of poverty include low quality education from poorly funded inner-city schools resulting in few marketable skills which leads to low-wage jobs which leads to less ability to pay for housing, food, clothing, medical care which leads to bad neighborhoods and further funding problems for schools, as well as less exposure to positive role models, and increased risk of serious illness.  (However, hard-working immigrants attending these same schools often end up economically successful proving that poor schools alone are not sufficient conditions for poverty. Racial and ethnic [[discrimination]] may also feed into these barriers.

Some claim that poverty is also the product of deindustrialization.  As the U.S. shifts from a manufacturing, industrial society to a service-oriented, high-tech society, many of the blue-collar jobs that required little education but paid well are disappearing or being outsourced.<ref name = Marger/>  Rural areas, such as [[Appalachia]], suffer losses of [[mining]] jobs, and cities such as [[Detroit]] lose many manufacturing jobs to automation or overseas factories.  Some people are unable to follow the jobs or commute to work are left in neighborhoods without employment or tax-basis to support needed social functions, such as schools, public transportation, police departments, etc.  Others simply cannot find jobs because of the shift towards a service-based economy; in economic terms these people are structurally unemployed due to the changing skills needed. However, the economist Steve Rose has shown, in several scholarly articles, that this claim is demonstrably false.

==Controversy==<!-- This section is linked from [[Poverty in the United States]] -->
There has been significant disagreement about poverty in the United States; particularly over how poverty ought to be defined. Using radically different definitions, two major groups of advocates dispute whether or not more resources are needed to help lessen poverty. Liberals consistently claim that more resources are needed to alleviate poverty.  Conservatives often argue that the condition of the poor does not presently require more resources but rather an allocation that encourages a temporary dependence upon the American social safety net.  

Much of the debate about poverty focuses on statistical measures of poverty and the clash between advocates and opponents of [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] programs and government regulation of the [[free market]]. Since measures can be either absolute or relative, it is possible that advocates for the different sides of this debate are basing their arguments on different ways of measuring poverty. It is often claimed that poverty is understated, yet there are some who also believe it is overstated; thus the accuracy of the current poverty threshold guidelines is subject to debate and considerable concern.

In a 2003 editorial in [[The Washington Times]], [[Bruce Bartlett]] wrote, "In a supplementary report that got no press attention, the Census Bureau looked at some of these new necessities and their ownership by the poor. It turns out many poor people today own appliances that were considered luxuries when I grew up, and some that would still be considered luxuries today. For example, 91 percent of those in the lowest 10 percent of households -- all officially poor -- own color TVs, 74 percent own microwave ovens, 55 percent own VCRs, 47 percent own clothes dryers, 42 percent own stereos, 23 percent own dishwashers, 21 percent own computers and 19 percent own garbage disposals. When I grew up in the 1950s, only the wealthy owned color TVs, clothes dryers, stereos, dishwashers and disposals. These were all considered luxuries. We got by with black-and-white TVs, hanging our wet clothes on a line to dry, washing dishes by hand and throwing our potato peels in a pail instead of down the drain. So did most other middle-class families. Not even the wealthiest people owned microwave ovens, VCRs or computers." <ref>[http://www.washtimes.com/news/2003/oct/05/20031005-111129-3478r/ Poverty yardstick variables], Bruce Bartlett, October 6, 2003</ref>

However, as noted in "EU versus USA", only 11% of those in the general UK population own a dishwasher, and the penetration rate of microwave ovens in the EU is generally well under 30% <ref name="EU versus USA">{{cite web|url=http://www.timbro.se/bokhandel/pdf/9175665646.pdf|title=EU versus USA|accessdate=2007-10-11}}</ref>. The report goes on to note that 46% of poor households in the US own their own home, and 30% have two or more cars, and 63% have cable or satellite TV. 

===Concerns regarding accuracy===
In recent years, there have been a number of concerns raised about the official U.S. poverty measure.  In 1995, the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]]'s Committee on National Statistics convened a panel on measuring poverty.  The findings of the panel were that "the official poverty measure in the United States is flawed and does not adequately inform policy-makers or the public about who is poor and who is not poor."

The panel was chaired by Robert Michael, former Dean of the Harris School of the [[University of Chicago]].  According to Michael, the official U.S. poverty measure "has not kept pace with far-reaching changes in society and the economy."  The panel proposed a model based on [[disposable income]]:  

{{cquote
|According to the panel's recommended measure, income would include, in addition to money received, the value of non-cash benefits such as food stamps, school lunches and public housing that can be used to satisfy basic needs. The new measure also would subtract from gross income certain expenses that cannot be used for these basic needs, such as income taxes, child-support payments, medical costs, health-insurance premiums and work-related expenses, including child care.<ref>Harms, W. (1995) [http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/950511/poverty.shtml  Poverty definition flawed, more accurate measure needed] The University of Chicago Chronicle, 14:17.</ref>}}

===Understating poverty===
Many sociologists and government officials have argued that poverty in the [[United States]] is understated, meaning that there are more [[household]]s living in actual poverty than there are households below the poverty threshold.<ref name="Dealing with Diversity">{{cite book | last =Adams  | first =J.Q.  | authorlink =  | coauthors =Pearlie Strother-Adams  | year =2001  | title =Dealing with Diversity  | publisher =Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company  | location =Chicago, IL | id = 0-7872-8145-X}}</ref> A recent [[National Public Radio|NPR]] report states that as much as 30% of Americans have trouble making ends meet and other advocates have made supporting claims that the rate of actual poverty in the US is far higher than that calculated by using the poverty threshold.<ref name="Dealing with Diversity">{{cite book | last =Adams  | first =J.Q.  | authorlink =  | coauthors =Pearlie Strother-Adams  | year =2001  | title =Dealing with Diversity  | publisher =Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company  | location =Chicago, IL|id = 0-7872-8145-X}}</ref> While the poverty threshold is updated for inflation every year, the basket of goods used to determine what constitutes being deprived of a socially acceptable miniumum standard of living has not been updated since 1955. As a result, the current poverty line only takes goods into account that were common more than 50 years ago, updating their cost using the Consumer Price Index. Mollie Orshansky, who devised the original goods basket and methodology to measure poverty, used by the U.S. government, in 1963-65, updated the goods basket in 2000, finding that the actual poverty threshold, i.e. the point where a person is excluded from the nation's prevailing consumption patterns, is at roughly 170% of the official poverty threshold.<ref name="Schwartz"/> According to John Schwarzt, a political scientist at the University of Arizona,

<blockquote>
The official poverty line today is essentially what it takes in today's dollars, adjusted for inflation, to purchase the same poverty-line level of living that was appropriate to a half century ago, in 1955, for that year furnished the basic data for the formula for the very first poverty measure. Updated thereafter only for inflation, the poverty line lost all connection over time with current consumption patterns of the average family. Quite a few families then didn't have their own private telephone, or a car, or even a mixer in their kitchen... The official poverty line has thus been allowed to fall substantially below a socially decent minimum, even though its intention was to measure such a minimum.
</blockquote>

The issue of understating poverty is especially pressing in states with both a [[Real estate pricing|high cost of living]] and a high poverty rate such as [[California]] where the [[Real estate pricing|median home price]] in May 2006 was determined to be $564,430.<ref name = "California median home price"/> With half of all homes being priced above the half million dollar mark and prices in urban areas such as [[San Francisco]], [[San Jose, CA|San Jose]] or [[Los Angeles]] being higher than the state average, it is almost impossible for not just the poor but also [[lower middle class]] worker to afford decent housing {{Fact|date=February 2007}}, and no possibility of home ownership. In the [[Monterey County, California#Home prices|Monterey area]], where the low-pay industry of agriculture is the largest sector in the economy and the majority of the population lacks a college education the median home price was determined to be $723,790, requiring an [[Household income in the United States|upper middle class income]] which only roughly 20% of all households in the county boast.<ref name="California median home price">{{cite web|url=http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/060627/20060627005927.html?.v=1|title=California median home price|accessdate=2006-07-06}}</ref><ref name="Monterey County income distribution">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=05000US06053&-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_QTP32&-ds_name=D&-_lang=en|title=Monterey County income distribution|accessdate=2006-07-06}}</ref> Such fluctuations in local markets are however not considered in the Federal poverty threshold and thus leave many who live in poverty-like conditions out of the total number of households classified as poor.

===Overstating poverty===
The federal poverty line also excludes income other than cash income, especially welfare benefits. Thus, if [[food stamps]] and [[public housing]] were successfully raising the standard of living for poverty stricken individuals, then the poverty line figures would not shift since they do not consider the income equivalents of such entitlements.<ref>[http://www.washtimes.com/commentary/20060906-100020-4785r.htm Poor Poverty Yardsticks] by Rea Hederman, [[Heritage Foundation]], ''Washington Post.'' September 7, 2006. Accessed: 2007-02-18 </ref>

A 1993 study of low income single mothers titled ''Making Ends Meet,'' by Kathryn Edin, a sociologist at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], showed that the mothers spent more than their reported incomes because they could not "make ends meet" without such expenditures. According to Edin, they made up the difference through contributions from family members, absent boyfriends, off-the-book jobs, and church charity.

According to Edin: "No one avoided the unnecessary expenditures, such as the occasional trip to the [[Dairy Queen]], or a pair of stylish new [[Athletic shoe|sneaker]]s for the son who might otherwise sell drugs to get them, or the Cable TV subscription for the kids home alone and you are afraid they will be out on the street if they are not watching TV."<ref>  However many mothers skipped meals or did odd jobs to cover those expenses.  According to Edin, "most welfare-reliant mothers food and shelter alone cost almost as much as these mothers received from the government.  For more than one-third, food and housing costs exceeded their cash benefits, leaving no extra money for uncovered medical care, clothing, and other household expenses."[http://192.211.16.13/curricular/mpafp1999/Poverty.htm Devising New Math to Define Poverty] by Louis Uchitelle, ''New York Times.'' 1999-10-18. Accessed: 2006-06-16 </ref>

Moreover, [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[free market]] [[think tank]] [[Timbro]] point out that lower-income households in the U.S. tend to own more appliances and larger houses than many middle-income Western Europeans.<ref name="Timbro, E.U. vs U.S.A">{{cite web|url=http://www.timbro.se/bokhandel/pdf/9175665646.pdf|title=E.U. vs U.S.A, [[Timbro]]|accessdate=2007-11-10}}</ref>

== Fighting poverty ==
There have been many governmental and [[Non-governmental organization|nongovernmental]] efforts to make an impact on poverty and its effects. These range in scope from neighborhood efforts to campaigns with a national focus.  They target specific groups affected by poverty such as children, autistics, immigrants, or the [[homeless]]. Efforts to alleviate poverty use a disparate set of methods, such as [[advocacy]], [[education]], [[social work]], [[legislation]], direct service or [[Charitable organization|charity]], and [[community organizing]].  

Recent debates have centered on the need for policies that focus on both "income poverty" and "asset poverty."  Advocates for the approach argue that traditional governmental poverty policies focus solely on supplementing the income of the poor, through programs such as AFCD and Food Stamps. These programs do little, if anything, to help the poor build assets and begin to lift themselves out of poverty.  Some have proposed creating a government matched savings plan (similar to the private 401K) system to provide a savings incentive to poor and lower-income individuals and families.

===Negative income tax===
- From 1968 to 1979 a massive social experiment was undertaken in the U.S.
[http://www.us.big.net/papers/013-Sheahen.doc : The Negative Income Tax Experiments of the 1970s in the USA]
The four experiments were in:

#Urban areas in [[New Jersey]] and [[Pennsylvania]] from 1968-1972 (1300 families).
#Rural areas in [[Iowa]] and [[North Carolina]] from 1969-1973 (800 families).
#[[Gary, Indiana]] from 1971-1974 (1800 families).
#[[Seattle]] and [[Denver]], from 1970-1978 (4800 families).

===Campaign to Reduce Poverty in America===
Catholic Charities USA released the [http://www.catholiccharitiesusa.org/poverty : "Campaign to Reduce Poverty in America"] based on its paper ''Poverty in America: A Threat to the Common Good'' in January 2007.

===From Poverty to Prosperity===
In April 2007 The [[Center for American Progress]], a think tank, released a report [http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/04/poverty_report.html : "From Poverty to Prosperity: A National Strategy to Cut Poverty in Half"]. It recommends 12 steps to cut poverty in half by 2017. 

#Raise and index the minimum wage to half the average hourly wage. At $5.15, the federal [[minimum wage]] is at its lowest level in real terms since 1956. The federal minimum wage was once 50 percent of the average wage but is now 30 percent of that wage. Congress should restore the minimum wage to 50 percent of the average wage, about $8.40 an hour in 2006. Doing so would help nearly 5 million poor workers and nearly 10 million other low-income workers.
# Expand the [[Earned Income Tax Credit]] and [[Child Tax Credit]]. As an earnings supplement for low-income working families, the EITC raises incomes and helps families build assets. The Child Tax Credit provides a tax credit of up to $1,000 per child, but provides no help to the poorest families. We recommend tripling the EITC for childless workers and expanding help to larger working families. We recommend making the Child Tax Credit available to all low- and moderate-income families. Doing so would move as many as 5 million people out of poverty.
#Promote [[Trade union|unionization]] by enacting the [[Employee Free Choice Act]]. The Employee Free Choice Act would require employers to recognize a union after a majority of workers signs cards authorizing union representation and establish stronger penalties for violation of employee rights. The increased union representation made possible by the Act would lead to better jobs and less poverty for American workers.
# Guarantee child care assistance to low-income families and promote early education for all. We propose that the federal and state governments guarantee child care help to families with incomes below about $40,000 a year, with expanded tax help to higher-earning families. At the same time, states should be encouraged to improve the quality of early education and broaden access for all children. Our child care expansion would raise employment among low-income parents and help nearly 3 million parents and children escape poverty.
#Create 2 million new “opportunity” housing vouchers, and promote equitable development in and around central cities. Nearly 8 million Americans live in neighborhoods of concentrated poverty where at least 40 percent of residents are poor. Our nation should seek to end concentrated poverty and economic segregation, and promote regional equity and inner-city revitalization. We propose that over the next 10 years the federal government fund 2 million new “opportunity vouchers” designed to help people live in opportunity-rich areas. Any new affordable housing should be in communities with employment opportunities and high-quality public services, or in gentrifying communities. These housing policies should be part of a broader effort to pursue equitable development strategies in regional and local planning efforts, including efforts to improve schools, create affordable housing, assure physical security, and enhance neighborhood amenities.
#Connect disadvantaged and disconnected youth with school and work. About 1.7 million poor youth ages 16 to 24 were out of school and out of work in 2005. We recommend that the federal government restore Youth Opportunity Grants to help the most disadvantaged communities and expand funding for effective and promising youth programs—with the goal of reaching 600,000 poor disadvantaged youth through these efforts. We propose a new Upward Pathway program to offer low-income youth opportunities to participate in service and training in fields that are in high-demand and provide needed public services.
#Simplify and expand [[Pell Grant]]s and make higher education accessible to residents of each state. Low-income youth are much less likely to attend college than their higher income peers, even among those of comparable abilities. Pell Grants play a crucial role for lower-income students. We propose to simplify the Pell grant application process, gradually raise Pell Grants to reach 70 percent of the average costs of attending a four-year public institution, and encourage institutions to do more to raise student completion rates. As the federal government does its part, states should develop strategies to make postsecondary education affordable for all residents, following promising models already underway in a number of states.
#Help former prisoners find stable employment and reintegrate into their communities. The United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world. We urge all states to develop comprehensive reentry services aimed at reintegrating former prisoners into their communities with full-time, consistent employment. 
#Ensure equity for low-wage workers in the [[Unemployment Insurance]] system. Only about 35 percent of the unemployed, and a smaller share of unemployed low-wage workers, receive unemployment insurance benefits. We recommend that states (with federal help) reform “monetary eligibility” rules that screen out low-wage workers, broaden eligibility for part-time workers and workers who have lost employment as a result of compelling family circumstances, and allow unemployed workers to use periods of unemployment as a time to upgrade their skills and qualifications.
#Modernize means-tested benefits programs to develop a coordinated system that helps workers and families. A well-functioning safety net should help people get into or return to work and ensure a decent level of living for those who cannot work or are temporarily between jobs. Our current system fails to do so. We recommend that governments at all levels simplify and improve benefits access for working families and improve services to individuals with disabilities. The Food Stamp Program should be strengthened to improve benefits, eligibility, and access. And the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program should be reformed to shift its focus from cutting caseloads to helping needy families find sustainable employment.
#Reduce the high costs of being poor and increase access to financial services. Despite having less income, lower-income families often pay more than middle and high-income families for the same consumer products. We recommend that the federal and state governments should address the foreclosure crisis through expanded mortgage assistance programs and by new federal legislation to curb unscrupulous practices. And we propose that the federal government establish a $50 million Financial Fairness Innovation Fund to support state efforts to broaden access to mainstream goods and financial services in predominantly low-income communities.
#Expand and simplify the Saver’s Credit to encourage saving for education, homeownership, and retirement. For many families, saving for purposes such as education, a home, or a small business is key to making economic progress. We propose that the federal “Saver’s Credit” be reformed to make it fully refundable. This Credit should also be broadened to apply to other appropriate savings vehicles intended to foster asset accumulation, with consideration given to including individual development accounts, children’s saving accounts, and college savings plans.
