==Background and military career==
Born in [[Rockford, Illinois]], he joined the [[Reserve Officer Training Corps]] (ROTC) at his local high school and was appointed to the [[U.S. Naval Academy]] in Annapolis, Maryland in 1921. Upon graduation in 1925 he received his ensign's commission and commenced his career aboard the battleship [[USS Maryland]]. In 1932 he entered flight training school at the U.S. Navy air station in Pensacola, Florida; after graduating as a naval aviator in 1933 he served as navigator and [[executive officer]] on three different ships.

During [[World War II]] Dufek commanded a flight training squadron, served as senior naval aviator in Algeria during the [[invasion of North Africa]], assisted in the planning for the invasion of Sicily and Salerno and, after his promotion to captain and subsequent reassignment, the invasion of southern France. In September 1944 he assumed command of the [[USS Bogue]], which sank the final [[U-boat|German submarine]] lost in World War II.

During the [[Korean War]] the Navy placed Dufek in command of the [[USS Antietam]], then on [[Kwajalein]] in the Pacific and finally at [[Naval Air Station Whidbey Island]] in [[Oak Harbor, Washington]].

==Arctic experience==
===With Admiral Byrd===
In the spring of 1939 Dufek, at this time a lieutenant, requested and received an assignment with Rear Admiral [[Richard E. Byrd]]'s third expedition to [[Antarctica]], where he served as navigator of the USS Bear, the flagship of the expedition. In recognition of his many hours of exploratory flying over the South Polar continent Dufek later received the [[United States Antarctic Expedition Medal|Antarctic Expedition Medal]].

===Operation Highjump===
After a brief post-war stint in Japan, Dufek was assigned as chief [[staff office]]r to a U.S. Navy-[[Coast Guard]] task force to establish weather bases in the polar regions. While there he participated in [[Operation Highjump]], a Naval expedition to Antarctica under the command of Admiral Byrd, during which he made the first flight over the [[Thurston Island|Thurston Peninsula]] and later rescued six survivors of another flight over the same area. He returned to Washington D.C. briefly but by 1947 was back in the Antarctic, this time commanding a task force sent to supply existing weather stations and to establish new ones near the Pole.

===Operation Deepfreeze===
In 1954 Dufek joined a special Antarctic planning group preparing for the Navy's [[Operation Deepfreeze]], a scientific polar research expedition. When planning was complete Dufek was given command of Task Force 43 which, with more than 80 officers and 1000 enlisted men, three [[ice-breaker]]s, and three [[cargo ship]]s, was charged with [[logistics]] and support for the expedition.

Among other accomplishments the task force established bases on [[Ross Island]] and in [[Little America]], and on [[October 31]], [[1956]],<ref name="SkytrainCentennialGov">{{cite web |url= http://www.centennialofflight.gov/user/fact_oct.htm |title= Aviation History Facts |author= U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission |quote= October 31 in 1956:  The [[United States Navy|US Navy]] R4D-5 [[C-47 Skytrain|Skytrain]] Que Sera Sera, commanded by [[Rear Admiral]] George Dufek, becomes the first airplane to make a landing at the [[South Pole]]. }} (Reference:  ''Aviation Year by Year,'' [[Bill Gunston]], ed.

After Admiral Byrd's death, Dufek was appointed to succeed him as supervisor of U.S. programs in the South Polar Regions.
