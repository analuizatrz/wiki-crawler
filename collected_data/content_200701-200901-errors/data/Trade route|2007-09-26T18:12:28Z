{{Trade route}}
A '''trade route''' is a sequence of [[pathway]]s and stopping places used for the [[Commerce|commercial]] [[transport]] of [[cargo]]. Trade routes can be over [[landform|land]] or  [[marine (ocean)|water]]. 

Trade routes have existed since the begining of [[civilization]] and&mdash;due to their importance&mdash;have often influenced the [[Major religious groups|religions]] and [[political]] policies of the regions involved.

==Early trade routes==
[[Image:Roadevol.svg|thumb|200px|left|Evolution of Indian road network. The main map shows the routes since the [[Mughal empire|Mughal times]], Inset A shows the major cultural currents of the prehistorical period, B shows pre-[[Maurya]]n Indian routes, C shows the Mauryan network, D shows the trade routes at the beginning of the [[Christian era]], and E shows the Indian "Z".]]
The peninsula of [[Anatolia]] lay on the land routes to [[Europe]] from [[Asia]] as well as the sea route from the [[Mediterranean]] to the [[Black Sea]].<ref name=Streans1>Stearns 2001: 37</ref> Records from the 19th century BCE attest to the existence of an [[Assyrian]] merchant colony at [[Kanesh]] in [[Cappadocia]] (now in modern [[Turkey]]).<ref name=Streans1/> The domestication of the [[camel]] allowed [[Arabian]] [[nomads]] to control the  long distance trade in [[spice]]s and [[silk]] from the [[Far East]] to the [[Arabian Peninsula]].<ref>Stearns 2001: 41</ref> The [[Egyptian]]s had trade routes through the [[Red sea]], importing spices from the "[[Land of Punt]]" (east Africa) and from [[Arabia]].<ref>Rawlinson 2001: 11-12</ref>

The period from 1500 BCE-1 CE saw the Western Asian, Mediterranean, [[Chinese]] and [[India]]n societies develop major transportation networks for trade.<ref name=Denemark1>Denemark 200: 274</ref> The main networks of the [[Old world]] included the [[Grand Trunk Road]] of [[India]] and the [[Incense Road]] of Arabia.<ref name=Denemark1/>

===Incense Route===
{{main|Incense route}}
The Incense Route served as a channel for trading of Indian, Arabian and East Asian goods.<ref name=Yemen1>{{cite web| title =  Traders of the Gold and Incense Road | publisher = Message of the Republic of Yemen, Berlin| url = http://www.botschaft-jemen.de/Geschichte.htm| format = HTML }}</ref> The incense trade flourished from South Arabia to the Mediterranean between roughly the 3rd century BCE to the 2nd century CE.<ref name=UNESCO1>{{cite web| title = Incense Route - Desert Cities in the Negev| publisher = UNESCO| url = http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1107| format = HTML }}</ref> This trade was crucial to the economy of [[Yemen]] and the [[frankincense]] and [[myrrh]] trees were seen as a source of wealth by the its  rulers.<ref>Glasse 2001: 59</ref>[[Image:GDRT230.jpg|right|150px|thumb|The economy of the [[Qataban|Kingdom of Qataban]] (light blue) was based on the cultivation and trade of spices and aromatics including frankincense and myrrh. These were exported to the Mediterranean, India and [[Abyssinia]] where they were greatly prized by many cultures, using camels on routes through Arabia, and to India by sea.]]

[[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]], emperor of [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], may have forged an alliance with the [[Lihyan|Lihyanites]] in order to secure the incense route at [[Al-`Ula|Dedan]], thereby rerouting the incense trade from Dedan to the coast along the Red Sea to Egypt.<ref>Kitchen 1994: 46</ref> [[I. E. S. Edwards]] connects the [[Syro-Ephraimite War]] to the desire of the [[Israelites]] and the [[Aramaeans]] to control the northern end of the Incence route, which ran up from Southern Arabia and could be tapped by commanding [[Transjordan]].<ref>Edwards 1969: 329</ref> 

[[Image:Tilglath pileser iii.jpg|130px|left|thumb| [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] attacked [[Gaza]] in order to control trade along the Incense Route.<ref>Edwards 1969: 330</ref>]][[Gerrha]], inhabited by [[Chaldean]] exiles from [[Babylon]], controlled the Incense trade routes across Arabia to the Mediterranean and exercised control over the trading of [[aromatics]] to Babylon in the 1st century BC.<ref>Larsen 1983: 56</ref> The [[Nabateans]] exercised control over the routes along the Incense Route.<ref name=Eckenstein1>Eckenstein 2005: 86</ref> In order to release the Incense Route from the Nabatean control military expeditions were undertaken, without success, by [[Antigonus Cyclops]], emperor of [[Syria]] and [[Palestine]].<ref name=Eckenstein1/> The Nabatean control over trade increased and spread in many directions.<ref name=Eckenstein1/>

The replacement of [[Greece]] by the [[Roman empire]] as the administrator of the Mediterranean basin led to the resumption of direct trade with the East and the elimination of the taxes extracted previously by the middlemen of the south.<ref name=Lach1>Lach 1994: 13</ref> The Romans sacked Ptolemaic Egypt and controlled [[Roman trade with India|trade with India]].<ref>Shaw 2003: 426</ref> The monopoly of the middlemen weakened with the development of monsoon trade, forcing the [[Parthian]] and Arabian middlemen to adjust their prices so as to compete on the Roman market with the goods now being bought in by a direct sea route to India.<ref name=Lach1/> Indian ships sailed to Egypt as the maritime routes of Southern Asia were not under the control of a single power.<ref name=Lach1/>

===Silk Route===
[[Image:SilkRoadPeoples.jpg|thumb|151px|Peoples of the Silk Road, [[Dunhuang]], China, 9th century.]]
{{main|Silk Road}}
The Silk road was one of the first trade routes to join the [[Eastern world|Eastern]] and the [[Western world]]s.<ref name=Elisseeff1>Elisseeff 2000: 326</ref> According to Vadime Elisseeff (2000):<ref name=Elisseeff1/>

<blockquote>
Along the Silk Roads, technology traveled, ideas were exchanged, and friendship and understanding between East and West were experienced for the first time on a large scale. Easterners were exposed to Western ideas and life-styles, and Westerners too, learned about Eastern culture and its spirituality-oriented cosmology. [[Buddhism]] as an Eastern religion received international attention through the Silk Roads.
</blockquote>[[Image:Transasia trade routes 1stC CE gr2.png|thumb|200px|left|Trading routes used around the 1st century CE centred on the Silk Road.]]

Cultural interactions patronized often by powerful emperors, such as [[Kanishka]], led to development of art due to introduction of a rich variety of influences.<ref name=Elisseeff1/> Buddhist missions thrived along the Silk Roads.<ref name=Elisseeff2>Elisseeff 2000: 5</ref> This was made possible due to the intermixing of trade and cultural values, which created a series of safe stoppages for both the pilgrims and the traders.<ref name=Elisseeff2/> Among the frequented routes of the Silk Route was the [[Myanmar|Burmese]] route extending from [[Bhamo]].<ref name=Elisseeff3>Elisseeff 2000: 14</ref> The activities along this route included [[Marco Polo]]'s visit to [[Yunnan]] and Indian monks traveling to [[Canton]] to establish [[Buddhist monasteries]].<ref name=Elisseeff3/> This route —  often under the presence of hostile tribes —  also finds mention in the works of [[Rashid al-Din]].<ref name=Elisseeff3/>

===Grand Trunk Road===
{{main|Grand Trunk Road}}
The Grand Trunk Road connecting [[Calcutta]] in India to [[Peshawar]] in [[Pakistan]] has existed for over two and a half [[millennia]].<ref name=Elisseeff4>Elisseeff 2000: 158</ref> One of the important trade routes of the world, this road has been a strategic artery with [[fortress]]es, halting posts, [[well]]s, [[post office]]s, [[milestone]]s and other facilities.<ref name=Elisseeff4/> Part of this road through Pakistan also coincided with the Silk Road.<ref name=Elisseeff4/>

This highway has been associated with emperors [[Chandragupta Maurya]] and [[Sher Shah Suri]], the latter became synonymous with this route due to his role in ensuring the safety of the travelers and the upkeep of the road.<ref name=Elisseeff5>Elisseeff 2000: 161</ref> Emperor Sher Shah widened and realigned the road to other routes, and provided approximately 1700 roadside [[inn]]s through his empire.<ref name=Elisseeff5/> These inns provided free food and lodgings to the travelers regardless of their status.<ref name=Elisseeff5/>

[[Image:GTRoad_Ambala.jpg|thumb|right|300px|For centuries, the Grand Trunk Road has served as the main artery from travel across Northern India. A scene from the [[Ambala]] cantonment during the British Raj.]]The British occupation of this road was of special significance for the [[British Raj]] in India.<ref name=Elisseeff6>Elisseeff 2000: 163</ref> Bridges, pathways, newer inns were constructed by the British for the first thirty seven years of their reign since the occupation of [[Punjab]] in 1849.<ref name=Elisseeff6/> The British followed roughly the same alignment as the old routes, and at some places the newer routes ran parallel to the older routes.<ref name=Elisseeff6/>

Vadime Elisseeff (2000) comments on the Grand Trunk Road:<ref>Elisseeff 2000: 178</ref>
<blockquote>
Along this road marched not only the mighty armies of conquerers, but also the caravans of traders, scholars, artists, and common folk. Together with people, moved ideas, languages, customs, and cultures, not just in one, but in both directions. At different meeting places—  permanent as well as temporary— people of different origins and from different cultural backgrounds, professing different faiths and creeds, eating different foods, wearing different clothes, and speaking different languages and dialects would meet one another peacefully. They would understand one another's food, dress, manner, and etiquette, and even borrow words, phrases, idioms and, at times, whole languages from others.
</blockquote>

===Amber Road===
[[Image:Rota do âmbar.jpg|thumb|170px|The Amber Route.]]
{{main|Amber Road}}
The Amber Road was an European trade route associated with the trade and transport of [[amber]].<ref name=Burns1>Burns 2003: 213</ref> Amber satisfied the criteria for long distance trade as it was light in weight and in high demand for ornamental purposes around the Mediterranean.<ref name=Burns1/> Before the establishment of Roman control over areas such as [[Pannonia]], the Amber Road was virtually the only route available for long distance trade.<ref name=Burns1/> 

Towns along the Amber Road began to rise steadily during the first century, despite the troop movements under [[Vespasian|Titus Flavius Vespasianus]] and his son [[Domitian|Titus Flavius Domitianus]].<ref>Burns 2003: 216</ref>
Under the reign of [[Tiberius|Tiberius Caesar Augustus]], the Amber Road was straightened and paved according to the prevailing urban standards.<ref name=Burns2>Burns 2003: 211</ref> Roman towns began to appear along the road, initially founded near the site of [[Celts|Celtic]] ''[[oppida]]''.<ref name=Burns2/>

The third century saw the [[Danube]] river become the principal artery of trade, eclipsing the Amber Road and other commercial routes.<ref name=Burns1/> The redirection of investment to the Danubian forts saw the towns along the Amber Road growing slowly, though yet retaining their prosperity.<ref>Burns 2003: 229</ref> The prolonged struggle between the Romans and the barbarians further left its mark on the towns along the Amber Road.<ref>Burns 2003: 231</ref>

===Via Maris===
[[Image:Ancient Levant routes.png|thumb|right|180px|The Via Maris (purple), [[King's Highway (ancient)|King's Highway]] (red), and other ancient Levantine trade routes, c. 1300 BCE]]
{{main|Via Maris}}
Via Maris, literally [[Latin]] for "the way of the sea,"<ref>Orlinsky 1981: 1064</ref> was an ancient highway used by the Romans and the [[Crusaders]].<ref name=Orlinsky1>Orlinsky 1981: 1065</ref> The states controlling the Via Maris were in a position to grant access for trade to their own citizens and collect tolls from the outsiders to maintain the trade route.<ref name=Silver1>Silver 1983: 49</ref> The name ''Via Maris'' is a Latin translation of a [[Hebrew]] phrase related to [[Isaiah]].<ref name=Orlinsky1/> Due to the [[Biblical]] significance many attempts have been made by the [[Christian]] pilgrims in order to locate the route, among other Biblical sites.<ref name=Orlinsky1/> 13th century traveler and pilgrim Burchard of [[Mount Zion]] refers to the Via Maris route as a way leading along the shore of the [[Sea of Galilee]].<ref name=Orlinsky1/>

===Spice Trade===
{{main|Spice trade}}
[[Image:Magellan'sVoyage.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Islands of Northern [[Indonesia]] and Southern [[Philippines]], commonly called the [[Spice Islands]].]]
As trade between India and the [[Greco-Roman world]] increased<ref><small>At any rate, when [[Cornelius Gallus|Gallus]] was prefect of Egypt, I accompanied him and ascended the [[Nile]] as far as [[Aswan|Syene]] and the frontiers of [[Kingdom of Aksum|Ethiopia]], and I learned that as many as one hundred and twenty vessels were sailing from [[Myos Hormos]] to India, whereas formerly, under the [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemies]], only a very few ventured to undertake the voyage and to carry on traffic in Indian merchandise. - [[Strabo]] (II.5.12.); [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/2E1*.html Source].</small></ref> spices became the main import from India to the Western world,<ref>Ball 2000: 131</ref> bypassing silk and other commodities.<ref>Ball 2000: 137</ref> The Indian commercial connection with South East Asia proved vital to the merchants of Arabia and Persia during the seventh century and the eighth century.<ref>Donkin 2003: 59</ref>

The [[Abbasids]] used [[Alexandria]], [[Damietta]], [[Aden]] and [[Siraf]] as entry ports to India and China.<ref name=Donkin3>Donkin 2003: 91-92</ref> Merchants arriving from India in the port city of Aden payed tribute in form of [[musk]], [[camphor]], [[ambergris]] and sandalwood to [[Ibn Ziyad]], the [[sultan]] of [[Yemen]].<ref name=Donkin3/> [[Molucca]]n products shipped across the ports of Arabia to the Near East passed through the ports of India and [[Sri Lanka]].<ref name=Donkin4>Donkin 2003: 92</ref>[[Image:Calicut 1572.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Image of [[Calicut]], India from Georg Braun and Franz Hogenber's atlas ''Civitates orbis terrarum'', 1572.]] Indian exports of spices find mention in the works of Ibn Khurdadhbeh (850), al-Ghafiqi (1150 AD), Ishak bin Imaran (907) and Al Kalkashandi (fourteenth century).<ref name=Donkin4/> After reaching either the Indian or the Sri Lankan ports were sometimes shipped to [[East Africa]], where they would be used for many purposes, including burial rites.<ref name=Donkin4/>

On the orders of [[Manuel I of Portugal]], four vessels under the command of navigator [[Vasco da Gama]] rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]], continuing to the eastern coast of Africa to [[Malindi]] to sail across the Indian Ocean to [[Calicut]].<ref name=Columbia1>[http://www.bartleby.com/65/ga/Gama-Vas.html Gama, Vasco da. The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. Columbia University Press.]</ref> The wealth of the [[Indies]] was now open for the Europeans to explore; the [[Portuguese Empire]] was one of the early European empires to grow from spice trade.<ref name=Columbia1/>

===Hanseatic trade===
{{main|Hanseatic League}}
[[Image:Haupthandelsroute Hanse.png|thumb|Main trading routes of the Hanseatic League.]]
Shortly before the twelfth century the [[Germans]] played a relatively modest role in the north European trade.<ref>Dollinger 1999: page 9</ref> With the development of Hanseatic trade German traders became prominent in the [[Baltic]] and the [[North Sea]] regions.<ref>Dollinger 1999: page 42</ref> Following the death king [[Eric VI of Denmark|Eric Menved]], German forces attacked and sacked [[Denmark]].<ref name=Dollinger1>Dollinger 1999: page 54</ref> The new administration bought artisans and merchants with them and controlled the Hansa regions.<ref name=Dollinger1/> During the third quarter of the fourteenth century the Hanseatic trade faced two major difficulties: economic conflict with the [[Flanders]] and hostilities with Denmark.<ref name=Dollinger2>Dollinger 1999: page 62</ref>[[Image:Extent of the Hansa.jpg|thumb|left|Northern Europe in 1400, showing the extent of the Hansa]] These events led to the formation of an organized association of Hanseatic towns, which replaced the earlier union of German merchants.<ref name=Dollinger2/> This new Hansa of the towns, aimed at protecting interests of the merchants and trade, became prominent for the next hundred and fifty years.<ref name=Dollinger2/>

Philippe Dollinger associates the downfall of the Hansa to a new alliance between [[Lubeck]], [[Hamburg]] and [[Bremen]], which outshadowed the older institution.<ref name=Dollinger3>Dollinger 1999: page xix</ref> He further sets the date of dissolution of the the Hansa at 1630.<ref name=Dollinger3/> The Hansa was almost entirely forgotten by the end of the eighteenth century.<ref name=Dollinger4>Dollinger 1999: page xx</ref> [[Georg Friedrich Sartorius|Sartorius]] published the first [[monograph]] regarding the community in the early years of the ninteeth century.<ref name=Dollinger4/>

==Modern trade routes==
[[Image:Transcontinental railroad route.png|thumb|right|200px|Route of the first American transcontinental railroad from Sacramento, California, to Council Bluffs, Iowa.]]
The 1844 [[Railway]] act of [[England]] compelled at least one [[train]] to a station every day with the third class fares priced at a [[penny]] a mile.<ref>Seaman 1973: 29-30</ref> Trade benefited as the workers and the lower classes had the ability to travel to other towns frequently.<ref name=Seaman1>Seaman 1973: 30</ref> Suburban communities began to develop and towns began to spread outwards.<ref name=Seaman1/> The British constructed a vast railway network in India, but it was considered to serve a strategic purpose in addition to the commercial purpose.<ref>Seaman 1973: 348</ref>

The modern times saw nations struggle for the control of rail routes.<ref name=Seaman2>Seaman 1973: 379</ref> The unification of the [[United States of America]] was helped by the efficient use of railways.<ref name=Seaman2/> The [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] was intended to be used by the [[Russia]]n government for control of [[Manchuria]] and later China; the [[German]] forces wanted to establish [[Berlin-Baghdad Railway]] in order to influence the Near East; and the [[Austria]]n government planned a route from [[Vienna]] to [[Salonika]] for control of the [[Balkans]].<ref name=Seaman2/>

[[Image:Btc pipeline route.png|left|200px|thumb|Route of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline]]The [[Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline]] connects the modern nation states of [[Azerbaijan]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Turkey]] through a buried pipeline.<ref name=bp1>[http://www.bp.com/genericarticle.do?categoryId=9006669&contentId=7014358 source]</ref> With a capacity to export one million barrels of oil a day, it has pump stations in all the three countries.<ref name=bp1/> Other examples of [[pipeline transport]] include [[Alashankou-Dushanzi Crude Oil Pipeline]] and [[Iran-Armenia Natural Gas Pipeline]].

Historically, governments followed a policy of protection of trade.<ref name=Columbia2>[http://www.bartelby.org/65/fr/freetrad.html free trade. The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2001-05.]</ref> International [[Free Trade]] became visible in 1860 with the Anglo-French commercial treaty and the sentiment further gained momentum during the post [[Second World War]] era.<ref name=Columbia2/> 
On May 2004, the United States of America signed the American Free trade Agreement with five [[Central America]]n nations.<ref name=Columbia2/>

According to [[The Columbia Encyclopedia]], Sixth Edition:<ref name=Columbia2/>[[Image:FedEx DC10.jpg|thumb|[[FedEx]] [[DC-10]]]]

<blockquote>
After World War II, strong sentiment developed throughout the world against protection and high tariffs and in favor of freer trade. The results were new organizations and agreements on international trade such as the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (1948), the [[Benelux Economic Union]] (1948), the [[European Economic Community]] (Common Market, 1957), the [[European Free Trade Association]] (1959), [[Mercosur]] (the Southern Cone Common Market, 1991), and the [[World Trade Organization]] (1995). In 1993 the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) was approved by the governments of Canada, [[Mexico]], and the United States. In the early 1990s the nations of the [[European Union]] (the successor organization to the [[Common Market]]) undertook to remove all barriers to the free movement of trade and employment across their mutual borders.
</blockquote>

Express delivery through international [[cargo airline]]s touched US $ 20 billion in 1998 and, according to the World Trade Organization, is expected to triple in 2015.<ref name=Hindley>Hindley 2004: 41</ref> In 1998, 50 pure cargo service companies operated internationally.<ref name=Hindley/>
