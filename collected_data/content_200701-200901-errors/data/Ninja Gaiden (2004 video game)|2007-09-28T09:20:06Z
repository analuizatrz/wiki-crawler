'''''Ninja Gaiden''''' is a console [[action-adventure game]] developed by [[Team Ninja]] and published by [[Tecmo]]. It was released in 2004 for the [[Xbox]] [[video game console]], and starts off a whole new ''Ninja Gaiden'' story and universe, different from the older [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] ''[[Ninja Gaiden (NES)|Ninja Gaiden]]'' series.  It has received much critical acclaim, with several publications proclaiming it the best video game ever made, inducting it into their Halls of Fame.

''Ninja Gaiden'' marks the first foray into the third-person, [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] action-adventure market for Team Ninja, and the ''Ninja Gaiden'' series.  Taking place in Japan and the fictional country of Vigoor, the game follows the super [[ninja]], [[Ryu Hayabusa]] as he goes through hordes of enemies in a variety of challenging environments to retrieve the stolen Dark Dragon Blade. It is famed among gamers for its challenging but rewarding difficulty, and the depth of its combat engine, allowing them to decapitate and blast away enemies with swords, shurikens, and magic arts. An online tournament was held for it shortly after its release. The qualifiers played over [[Xbox Live]] established record-breaking participation, and culminated in the finalists having their showdown at the [[Tokyo Game Show]] 2004.

The game mechanics of ''Ninja Gaiden'' have gradually evolved through downloadable contents and two re-releases, '''''Ninja Gaiden Black''''' for the Xbox in 2005, and '''''Ninja Gaiden Sigma''''' for the [[PlayStation 3]] in 2007. Its saga will be continued in ''[[Ninja Gaiden Dragon Sword]]'' on the [[Nintendo DS]], and later on in ''[[Ninja Gaiden II (Xbox 360)|Ninja Gaiden II]]'' on the [[Xbox 360]].

==Gameplay==
The player controls Ryu Hayabusa, guiding him in a [[third-person shooter|third person]] view, fighting foes and exploring the environment of the 3D world. Except for a few situations dictated by the story, Ryu is unrestrained in his exploration, running through the streets, jumping and running up and along walls, and acrobatically swinging from pole to pole. Though the game world is loaded in stages, it is remarkably smooth on the Xbox that such loadings are said to be negligible.<ref name ="gwxngrev">{{cite web

Ninja Gaiden has earned the right to say this, because Ninja Gaiden literally has no problems with its gameplay.

The loading time for a new level is very brief and it loads the entire area...or so it seems.  That is where Team Ninja pulls off a little Ninjitsu magic of their own.  As you enter a room there is a short transition where Ryu walks through the doorway, I suspect that there is a little burst loading done at that point.  It is fairly seamless and it ensures that you are only loading an area once."</ref>

''Ninja Gaiden''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> standard game mode, Story Mode, follows the pacing of the typical [[action-adventure game]], where the protagonist starts off weak at the beginning of the story and can be built up to have a larger life bar, more powerful weapons and magical ability through items or purchases, by the end of the it. The player's performance in this mode is based purely on the karma score, with "Master Ninja" as the highest rank, and "Ninja Dog" for the worst scores.

Another gaming experience was introduced in ''Ninja Gaiden Black'' and ''Sigma'', in the form of Mission Mode. The missions are short sessions of pure combat action, and each mission typically comes with its own equipment loadout for the player. The highest scores for each mission are accumulated for the player's Mission Mode score.

Players can upload their scores to online ranking boards for both modes, and compete with other players to get the best scores. Besides this, the games also promote replayability with the large number of Mission Mode missions, and unlockable costumes and emulated games for completing Story Mode on different difficulties.

It's very likely that, during those moments, you'll come to the conclusion that the game is perfect, or at least as close to perfect as any game has managed in this generation. [...] More importantly, the controls are absolutely spot-on, responding immediately to your commands to the point where it feels as if there's really no hunk of plastic tethered to a cable between you and the on-screen action."</ref> Using only the control stick and three buttons, the player is able to make Ryu block, dodge and attack with ease. Ryu's defence is unbreakable to most attacks, though he has to be wary against grab attacks. He can also dodge attacks with a well-timed 'reverse-wind' (tumble and roll).

Ryu has a multitude of weapons to choose from, to engage the enemies besieging him. With the light swords (Dragon Sword, Kitetsu, etc), he is able to perform quick attacks, the Flying Swallow (high speed leaping slash) - cutting through foes, as well as his signature Izuna Drop (leaping spinning [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)|piledriver]]) - smashing foes into the ground. Heavy weapons like the Dabilahro, swing with slow but powerful momentum. Flails and staves let him show off flashy but useful attacks. The super weapon typical of most action games is here in the form of the Unlabored Flawlessness, the fully upgraded form of the wooden sword. [[Shuriken]]s and arrows, make up the rest of his arsenal, allowing him to hurt his foes at a distance.

By absorbing essences given off by slain enemies, Ryu can unleash super powerful attacks known as Ultimate Techniques. Each weapon bears its own unique Ultimate Technique, and besides dealing out heavy damage to the unfortunate foes caught in them, it also grants Ryu invulnerability during the attack. In the later versions of ''Ninja Gaiden'', these techniques award karma points, making them an integral part of high scoring play.

Lastly, fueled by his ki, Ryu can cast ninpos (magic spells), harming his foes with fireballs, ice storms or bolts of lightning while avoiding damage from their attacks.

==Plot and setting==
[[Image:NGB Meeting Alma.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A meeting in the monastery. Note the Byzantine architecture of the hall.]]''Ninja Gaiden'''s world consists of fictional locations between two countries, [[Japan]] and the fictional Vigoor Empire. For the Japanese locations, the ninja fortress and the Hayabusa village are designed in the typical Japanese [[Japanese architecture#Heian period|Heian period]] architecture, set amongst the mountains.

The Vigoor Empire is an imaginative environment, consisting of a variety of real world cultural influences. The city of Tairon bears the marks of [[Islamic architecture]] with [[Arabic language|Arabic]] letterings found on various gates and structures. The monastery bears the looks of [[Byzantine architecture]] with the large spacious hall, multiple levels of windows and archways. The hidden underground evokes the influence of ancient [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Ancient Egyptian architecture|Egypt]], while the [[pyramid]] is that of a [[Sumerian architecture|Sumerian]] [[ziggurat]]. Overall, ''Ninja Gaiden'' is a reckless mish-mash of unrelated styles. Itagaki has admitted to this, saying "I just put everything in that I wanted to create!"<ref name="teamxbox_int" />

===Characters===
{{main|List of Ninja Gaiden characters}}
The protagonist and the only playable character in ''Ninja Gaiden'' and ''Ninja Gaiden Black'' is the super ninja, [[List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Ryu Hayabusa 2|Ryu Hayabusa]]. A man of few words, he works alone in his quest. He ends up rescuing the fiend hunter, [[List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Supporting characters 2|Rachel]] (who is another playable character in ''Ninja Gaiden Sigma'') quite a number of times over the course of the game.

The bulk of enemies the protagonist faces in the game are Fiends, humans turned into supernatural creatures through cursing of their blood.<ref>'''Rachel:''' It's hard to believe they were ever humans, isn't it?

</ref> only [[List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Leaders of the Fiends|Doku]] plays a major role in the storyline, being the one who starts off Ryu's quest for vengeance, by killing his village, stealing the Dark Dragon Blade, and having turned [[List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Leaders of the Fiends|Alma]] into a Fiend.

===Story===
Taking place two years before the first ''[[Dead or Alive (arcade game)|Dead or Alive]]'' game, the story starts off with the raid on the Hayabusa village and theft of the Dark Dragon Blade during Ryu's visit on his uncle, [[List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Ninjas|Murai]]. Ryu rushes back to his village on receiving the news but is cut down by Doku, ending the scene with the Hayabusa's spiritual animal, a [[falcon]] watching over Ryu's fallen body.

Guided in the background by [[List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Supporting characters 2|Ayane]], Ryu cuts a bloody swath through the streets of Tairon, leaving death and destruction. In his adventures, he meets the Fiend Hunter, Rachel and the enigmatic swordsmith, [[List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Supporting characters 2|Muramasa]], both of whom aid him in their own ways.

Ryu finally metes out his vengeance on Doku in a [[labyrinth]], but the latter casts the blood curse on Ryu with his last breath.<ref>'''Spirit Doku:''' Receive the curse, become a Fiend. {{cite video game

With the Emperor's hold on his realm gone, it starts to collapse. Ryu loses his grip on the Dark Dragon Blade while escaping. It is picked up by the [[List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Ninjas|Dark Disciple]] who was shadowing Ryu throughout his adventure. Unmasking himself to be Murai, the whole ordeal is revealed to be a set up by him to infuse the Blade with the souls harnessed from Ryu's quest of vengeance, thereby restoring its evil power.<ref>'''Dark Disciple:''' Gamov, so the Dark Dragon grows in power with each killing. {{cite video game

The story ends with Ryu defeating Murai, and shattering the Dark Dragon Blade with the True Dragon Sword. Simply stating "It's over...", Ryu turns himself into a falcon and flew back to the Hayabusa village.

</ref> However, due to the strong outcries to the game's difficulty, he instituted the Ninja Dog mode as a double-edged compromise: it can only be accessed through dying three successive times (similar to the Special Edition of ''[[Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening#Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition|Devil May Cry 3]]'') within the first stage, at which point the player is asked, "Do you wish to abandon the way of the ninja?" If the player accepts, the game enters Ninja Dog and continues on under a condescending atmosphere - pink ribbons for accessories, Ayane taking on an attitude to Ryu, etc.

''Ninja Gaiden Black'' is, however, more difficult than the original release, especially on the higher difficulties. Several bosses including [[List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Leaders of the Fiends|Spirit Doku]] and the Dark Disciple attack faster and more furiously, plus a variety of dangerous new foes have been added to make life even harder. Furthermore, players who have previously played ''Ninja Gaiden'' will find the Flying Swallow move, previously a powerful and useful technique, has been noticeably toned down and is a mere shadow of its old self, with a couple of new enemies having moves specifically to punish usage of it against them. On Hard difficulty and above, foes block the Flying Swallow more frequently, forcing players to adapt to a new style of fighting.

[[Image:NGB FS Counter.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Ryu's Flying Swallow meets a bayonet in his gut.]]''Hurricane Pack 1'''s design, along with several new in-game cutscenes were effectively integrated into Story Mode, and playable on all difficulty levels, including the new Ninja Dog and Master Ninja difficulty. Encounters were added on higher levels of difficulty to surprise players on their first play, and almost all foes were given grabbing, guard breaking or crushing attacks. This coupled with the increase in the enemies' aggressiveness made the player more wary on their toes, and less likely to '[[Turtle (game term)|turtle]]' in ''Ninja Gaiden Black''.

New elements are continually introduced as the player clears the higher difficulties with the aid of the Lunar and Smoke Bombs (a new projectile which aids in distracting enemies). As the player attempts the higher difficulties, he will encounter foes from the ''Hurricane Packs'', as well as new ones, like explosive bats, flame ninjas (red-clad ninjas whose attacks inflict additional flame damage), and Ryu's evil shadows, the [[List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Fiends|Doppelganger Fiends]]. New costumes for Ryu were also available for the player to unlock, as well as the ''[[Ninja Gaiden (arcade game)|Ninja Gaiden arcade game]]'' (which took the place of the three bonus unlockable NES games in ''Ninja Gaiden'').

Mission Mode introduced 46 missions concentrating on combat in small arenas. The majority of the missions are new scenarios, while several are modified versions of fights found in Story Mode. The game the finalists played in the World Wide Master Ninja Tournament 2004 finalists was implemented as one of the missions. The longest mission is Eternal Legend, which is ''Hurricane Pack 2'' implemented on ''Ninja Gaiden Black''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> engine.

</ref> almost all of the bonus features from the two previous versions were excluded from this version. Unlockable costumes were reduced to only two, and the old NES and arcade games which can be unlocked previously were eliminated. The introductory movie chronicling the legend of the Dark Dragon Blade and the Dragon Sword was also no longer in the game.

Graphics were overhauled to [[High-definition video|high definition]] standards. Vast changes were made to the layout of a few environments. A great number of new save and shop locations were added, and Rachel's three chapters were simply inserted amongst Ryu's Story Mode chapters. New foes, like the biker [[List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Vigoor military|MVAPs]], the fish-men [[List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Fiends|girtablilu]], and the wisp-like [[List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Fiends|phantoms]], were introduced with the two new bosses, [[List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Vigoor military|Gamov]] and [[List of Ninja Gaiden characters#Vigoor military|Alternator]], with quite a few changes made to the specifications (AI, damage, etc) of the old foes. The player can fight these foes with the new weapon, a pair of [[katana]]s, the Dragon's Claw & Tiger's Fang.

Ryu's reverse wind technique was replaced with that of his ninja foes. He can now fight on water, and shoot arrows in mid-air. The most prominent change allowed the player to use restoration items without going through the menus. The controller can also be shaken to increase a casted ninpo's power.

</ref> The player goes through the missions without any restoration item, and keeps fighting enemies until the character's life is reduced to zero. Online rankings primarily keep track of the player's individual mission records, in terms of the number of kills.

A demo was released on [[April 26]], [[2007]], over the PlayStation Network. Like the original ''Ninja Gaiden''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> demo, the player is restricted to chapter one's game world. However the demo unlocks the next higher difficulty when the player completes it on a lower difficulty. The player can also play as Rachel in a separate mission.

On starting the very first game on the retail version, the player can be rewarded with a bonus amount of yellow essence based on the player's achievements in the demo. The demo exhibited a scoring glitch which resulted in ridiculously high scores on the leaderboards to the dismay of many ''Ninja Gaiden'' veterans.

Being rated as a 'Mature' video game, ''Ninja Gaiden'' can retain its heavy gore content (blood, violence, decapitations, grotesque monsters) without any censorship. However, the ratings systems for certain countries prohibit beheadings from being depicted in them. Several of these decisions were based on public opinion over current events, and as such there are differences in the rulings between versions.

Despite heavy suspicions that the European release of the game would be censored in certain aspects, [[Microsoft]] reassured the crowd in March 2004 that the gore would be left intact.<ref>{{cite news

</ref> [[Germany|German]] law forbids games featuring the decapitations portrayed in ''Ninja Gaiden'', to be released to those 18 years old and above. As such, decapitations were removed from the PAL retail versions. However, a year later, ''Ninja Gaiden Black'' was accredited with the same rating by the [[Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle|USK]], but the decapitations were left untouched in the [[PAL region|PAL]] versions.

Since 2006, [[Japan]] has become more stringent with [[Computer Entertainment Rating Organization|CERO]], its violence rating system. Therefore, ''Ninja Gaiden Sigma'' cannot feature human decapitation unless Tecmo is willing to accept a 'Z' rating for the game. As it is sold in Japan under the 'D' rating, there are no decapitations in the [[NTSC|NTSC/J]] version of ''Ninja Gaiden Sigma''.

''Ninja Gaiden'' received near universal critical acclaim. [[GameSpot]] acclaimed it as "one of the best most challenging action adventure games ever made." [[IGN]] said it "sets a new standard for third-person action games in terms of length, depth, speed, and gore."

''Ninja Gaiden Black'' despite being an enhancement of ''Ninja Gaiden'' still managed to awe its reviewers. GameSpot hailed it having the best visual and audio presentation on the Xbox and its new features, "mission mode distills the game down to its purest essentials". IGN called its release "a rare and welcome day" for a re-release which can "bring your excitement levels back to the first time you played the game."

From a technical viewpoint, ''Ninja Gaiden'' and ''Ninja Gaiden Black'' were regarded by the reviewers as epitomes of Xbox programming, fully using and pushing to the limits the resources of the console while still performing fluidly. GameSpot was floored by their "Absolutely first-rate presentation--visuals and audio still second-to-none" while IGN claimed their standards were such "that can make you momentarily forget about the next generation of consoles". When the Xbox 360 was released, ''Ninja Gaiden'' and ''Ninja Gaiden Black'' were listed among the Xbox's top games and set for [[backward compatibility]] in all three regions right at the very start.<ref>{{cite news

When ''Ninja Gaiden Sigma'' was released, the reviewing community was divided in its opinion over the technical aspects. While [[Electronic Gaming Monthly|EGM]] gushed over the updated graphics, calling it "a gorgeous reworking of the modern ninja classic", Pro-G was harsh on it, saying they are average by next-gen standards with occasional "tearing, jagged edges and miss matched collision between bloodstains and walls." Frequent loadings unseen in the Xbox versions (which refuse to go away despite installing the game on the local hard drive), as well as previous recognized flaws remaining unfixed were on the lists of complaints, characterized by EGM bemoaning "weird glitches (sync problems that make the screen "tear" when the camera moves, odd bouts of loading where the screen briefly fades to gray, even in combat)" made the game "feel like a bit of a slapdash port."

''Ninja Gaiden Sigma''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> lack of new attractive features raised the question on the value of a remake of a remake of a game. Pro-G stated none of ''Sigma''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> features made it worthwhile as a full priced game which "has, in effect, been available for years in one form or another" while [[Eurogamer]] said ''Sigma'' lacked the "wow factor", compared to the advancements found in ''[[God of War (video game)|God of War]]'' ''1'' and ''2''. EGM mocked the controller-shaking to power up a ninpo as a "foolishly tacked-on Sixaxis functionality" and "silly". Rachel's implementation as a playable character was dampened with IGN wishing they could "get back to Ryu's sections simply because he's more fun to play", though DailyGame said her slowness brings "much-needed respite for newcomers and provide something new for experienced players."<ref>{{cite web

The games have become quite well known throughout the gaming community for its difficulty<ref> See ''[[Penny Arcade (webcomic)|Penny Arcade]]'' for a concise summary of fan reaction: [http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/03/08 "A Brief Index of Difficulty"]; see also Tycho's newpost [http://www.penny-arcade.com/2004/03/08 comment]: "Shit ''damn'' Ninja Gaiden is hard, it's so hard that your ''friends'' will die. It's also completely great - once you've gone a few levels, just start a new game real quick and take a look at the guys you thought were bad-asses before. Those guys are ''feather pillows'' compared to the beasts and murderers you rub up against later." Tycho later [http://www.penny-arcade.com/2004/12/27] commented: "When you first start playing Ninja Gaiden you might be overwhelmed with its difficulty - that was certainly true in my case. In fact, it was difficult to the degree that it was utterly demoralizing and it ended up on the shelf underneath something else so I wouldn't constantly be reminded of my deficiencies."</ref> which is both a blessing and a curse. While ''Ninja Gaiden'' appeals to gamers who like [[Pro-G]] desire a "bloody hard, but also bloody good" challenge, casual gamers seem to find the learning curve daunting. IGN enthused about ''Ninja Gaiden Black''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> difficulty but cautioned those with lesser ability will unlikely be able to "get as much out of this game as others due to the incredible difficulty of most of the new content."

One common criticism of ''Ninja Gaiden'' and its offshoots, is with the camera placement. While the default camera controls are adequate for most fights in centering the action on Ryu and his surroundings, there are certain fights where the camera is locked on a certain object (usually a boss), or loses track of Ryu. Although reviewers acknowledged the rotational control of the camera implemented since the ''Hurricane Packs'' is an improvement, it is of no help when the camera angle is locked.

===Legacy===
''Ninja Gaiden'' spawned two re-releases, ''Ninja Gaiden Black'', and ''Ninja Gaiden Sigma''. ''Ninja Gaiden'' and ''Ninja Gaiden Black'' has accounted for 1.5 million copies sold to consumers, while Tecmo has shipped 500,000 copies of ''Ninja Gaiden Sigma'' to the retailers as of August, 2007.<ref>{{cite news

Clive Thompson focused on ''Ninja Gaiden'' in his [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'s article on the rewards of conquering difficult games.<ref>{{cite web

</ref> In it, he says that while some games are hard just to frustrate and hinder players, overcoming ''Ninja Gaiden''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> rewards you with "a sort of exhausted exhilaration, like finally reaching the end of ''[[War and Peace]]''". ''Ninja Gaiden'' is recognised as a game which has successfully struck that balance between challenge and reward.

===Merchandises===
Tecmo produces several merchandises for its own products, and ''Ninja Gaiden'' is no exception. Its online shop carries mostly apparel in the form of caps, wristbands, t-shirts, etc. The original soundtrack of the game has also been released to the music industry.

Kotobukiya was contracted to produce PVC figures for the collectible industry. The statues are in the [[1:6 scale modeling|1/6th scale]], ranging from 10.6 to 12.4 inches tall. As of now, only statues of Ryu, Ayane, Kureha, and Rachel have been produced.<ref>{{cite web
