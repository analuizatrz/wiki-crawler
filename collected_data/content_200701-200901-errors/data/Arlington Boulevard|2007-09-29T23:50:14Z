Arlington Boulevard begins in the east at an interchange with [[Interstate 66]], [[Virginia State Route 110]], and the [[George Washington Memorial Parkway]] (I-66 Exit 75) at the foot of the [[Theodore Roosevelt Bridge]] over the [[Potomac River]] to Washington, DC.  It proceeds westward soon turning south along the edge of [[Fort Myer]] [[United States Army|army]] post.  Most of the [[junction (traffic)|junction]]s in this section are grade-separated [[interchange (road)|interchange]]s.  At an interchange with [[Washington Boulevard (Arlington)|Washington Boulevard]] ([[Virginia State Route 27|VA 27]]), the road turns west again and continues in that direction for the remainder of its length.

Arlington Boulevard has interchanges with [[Virginia State Route 120|VA 120]] ([[Glebe Road]]) in Arlington County and [[Virginia State Route 7|VA 7]] ([[Leesburg Pike]])/[[Virginia State Route 338|VA 338]] (Hillwood Avenue)/[[Virginia State Route 613 (Fairfax County)|SR 613]] ([[Wilson Boulevard]]) at [[Seven Corners, Virginia|Seven Corners]] and [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|I-495 (Capital Beltway)]] in Fairfax County.

Arlington Boulevard has a shorter history than many other major arterial roads in the region and was only built in the first half of the 20th century in several stages beginning in the west in progressing east.  The entire route was complete in 1938 with the final section around Fort Myer.  The road was originally called '''Lee Boulevard''' but, with [[Lee Highway]] being another major route in Northern Virginia, the name was changed to Arlington Boulevard in the early 1950s.

Between 1935-37, the US 50 designation was attached to the road even though it had yet to be completed past Glebe Road, then [[State Route 9 (Virginia 1933-1940)|VA 9]].  Before that, the road was [[State Route 236 (Virginia 1933)|VA 236]], a number now assigned to the nearby [[Little River Turnpike]].

The completed Arlington Boulevard's eastern terminus was originally the George Washington Memorial Parkway crossing in the District of Columbia at [[Columbia Island (District of Columbia)|Columbia Island]].  With the completion of the Theodore Roosevelt Bridge in 1964, Arlington Boulevard's terminus was moved to its present location.

Arlington Boulevard is [[as of 2007|currently]] undergoing major improvements in Arlington County and "the long-range vision is to transform Arlington Boulevard into a parkway route through the County, one that is made safer for bus riders, bicyclists and pedestrians and one that serves as an appropriate gateway into the County."<ref>[http://www.arlingtonva.us/NewsReleases/Scripts/ViewDetail.asp?Index=1425 "Arlington Boulevard Improvement Process to Begin."] Arlington County Government Press Release.
