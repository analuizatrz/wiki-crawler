'''GM Holden Ltd''' is an [[Australia]]n automaker based in [[Port Melbourne, Victoria]]. The company was originally independent, but since 1931 has been a subsidiary of [[General Motors]] (GM). Holden has taken charge of vehicle operations for GM in [[Australasia]] and, on behalf of GM, holds partial ownership of [[GM Daewoo]] in [[South Korea]]. Over the years, Holden has offered a broad range of locally produced vehicles, supplemented by imported GM models. In the past, Holden has offered [[Badge engineering|rebadged]] [[Nissan Motors|Nissan]] and [[Toyota]] models in sharing arrangements.

Holden [[Bodywork|car bodies]] are manufactured at [[Elizabeth, South Australia]], and engines are produced at Port Melbourne, Victoria. Historically, production or assembly plants were operated in all mainland [[States and territories of Australia|states of Australia]]: [[Acacia Ridge, Queensland]]; [[Dandenong, Victoria]]; [[Mosman Park, Western Australia]]; [[Pagewood, New South Wales]]; and [[Woodville, South Australia]]. Until 1990, [[Holden New Zealand]] also operated a plant based in [[Trentham, New Zealand|Trentham]], and until 1984 in [[Petone]] as well. The consolidation of car production at Elizabeth, South Australia, was completed in 1988, but some assembly operations continued at Dandenong until 1996.

Although Holden's involvement in exports has fluctuated since the 1950s, the declining sales of large cars in Australia has led the company to look to international markets to increase profitability; in 2006, exports alone accounted for almost [[Australian dollar|AU$]]1.3&nbsp;billion in earnings.

== History of the marque ==
=== Early history ===
In 1852, James Alexander Holden emigrated to [[South Australia]] from [[England]] and in 1856 established ''J.A. Holden & Co'', a saddlery business in [[Adelaide]].<ref>Davis, Kennedy, Kennedy (Part One), p. 16</ref> [[Edward Holden]], James' son, joined the firm in 1905 with an interest in automobiles.<ref>{{cite web | last = Hancock | first = Joan | coauthors = Richards, Eric | url = http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A090705b.htm | title = Holden, Sir Edward Wheewall (1885 - 1947) | work = [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]] | publisher = [[Melbourne University Publishing]] | accessdate = 2007-05-18}}</ref> From there, the firm evolved through various partnerships and, in 1908, Holden and Frost moved into the business of minor repairs to car upholstery.<ref name = "Holden History">{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/history_holden.htm | title = Holden History | publisher = Unique Cars and Parts | accessdate = 2007-06-12}}</ref> The company began to produce complete motorcycle sidecar bodies in 1913, and Edward experimented with fitting bodies to different types of carriages.<ref name = "milestones">{{cite web | url = http://media.gm.com/aus/holden/en/company/history/history_milestones.html | title = Holden Company Milestones | publisher = [[General Motors]] | accessdate = 2007-05-19}}</ref> After 1917, wartime trade restrictions led the company to start full-scale production of vehicle body shells. J.A. Holden founded a new company in 1919, ''Holden's Motor Body Builders Ltd'' (HMBB) specialising in car bodies. By 1923, HMBB were producing 12,000&nbsp;units per year.<ref name = "Holden History"/> From 1924, HMBB became the exclusive supplier of car bodies for GM in Australia, with manufacturing taking place at the new [[Woodville, South Australia]] plant.<ref name = "The Holden car in Australia">{{cite web | url = http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/holdencar/index.htm | title = The Holden car in Australia | publisher = [[Government of Australia]] | accessdate = 2007-12-04}}</ref> These bodies were made to suit a number of [[chassis]] imported from manufacturers such as [[Chevrolet]] and [[Dodge]].<ref name = "Holden History"/> The [[Great Depression]] era led to a substantial downturn in production, from 34,000&nbsp;units annually in 1930 to just 1,651&nbsp;units one year later.<ref name = "Holden History"/> In 1931, General Motors purchased the business and formed ''General Motors–Holden's Ltd''.<ref>Davis, Kennedy, Kennedy (Part One), p. 6</ref> Since then, two name changes have occurred: the first, in 1998, changed the name to ''Holden Ltd'', and the second, in May 2005, to ''GM Holden Ltd''.<ref>Davis, Kennedy, Kennedy (Part One), p. 9</ref>

=== 1950s ===
During the 1950s, Holden dominated the Australian car market. General Motors invested heavily in production capacity, which allowed the company to meet increased post-war demand for motor cars.<ref name = "milestones"/> Less expensive four-cylinder cars did not offer Holden's ability to deal with rugged rural areas.<ref name = "NAA"/><ref>Davis, Kennedy, Kennedy (Part One), p. 38</ref> [[Holden 48-215|48-215]] sedans were produced in parallel with the [[Holden 48-215|50-2106]] [[coupé utility]] from 1951; the latter was known [[Colloquialism|colloquially]] as the "ute" and became ubiquitous in Australian [[rural]] areas as the workhorse of choice. Production of both the ute and sedan continued with minor changes until 1953, when they were replaced by the facelifted [[Holden FJ|FJ]] model, introducing a third [[panel van]] [[Car body style|body style]].<ref>{{cite web | date = [[2001-04-24]] | url = http://www.autoweb.com.au/A_53869/cms/newsarticle.html | title = An Aussie Icon Turns 50 - The Holden Ute: 1951 - 2001 | work = AutoWeb | publisher = Web Publications | accessdate = 2007-05-30}}</ref> The FJ was the first major change to the Holden since its 1948 introduction.

[[Image:1961-1962 Holden EK Special Station Sedan 01.jpg|thumb|left|The EK was Holden's response to the [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Ford Falcon]], and was available with automatic transmission.]]

=== 1960s ===
In the 1960s, Holden faced serious competition for the first time; its major competitors began to import cars.<ref>Wright (1998), p. 121</ref> Holden in 1960, introduced its third major new model, the FB. The car's style was inspired by 1950s Chevrolets, with [[tailfin]]s and a wrap-around [[windshield]] with "dog leg" [[Pillar (car)|A-pillars]]. By the time it was introduced, many considered the appearance dated. Much of the motoring industry at the time noted that the adopted style did not translate well to the more compact Holden.<ref>Wright (1998), p. 122</ref> The FB became the first Holden that was adapted for [[Traffic directionality|left-hand-drive]] markets, enhancing its export potential.<ref>Davis, Kennedy, Kennedy (Part One), p. 46</ref> In 1960, [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] unveiled the new [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Falcon]] in Australia, only months after its introduction in the United States. To Holden's advantage, the Falcon was not durable, particularly in the front suspension, making it ill-suited for [[Environment of Australia|Australian conditions]].<ref>Wright (1998), p. 133–134</ref> In response to the Falcon, Holden introduced the facelifted EK in 1961; the new model featured two-tone paintwork and optional [[automatic transmission]].<ref>Davis, Kennedy, Kennedy (Part One), p. 48</ref> An all-new EJ model came in 1962, debuting the new luxury oriented "Premier" model.<ref>Wright (1998), p. 135</ref> The [[Holden EH|EH]] update came a year later brining the new [[Holden Red motor|''Red'' motor]], providing better performance than the previous [[Holden Grey motor|''Grey'' motor]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/holden_red_motor.htm | title = Holden 6 Cylinder Red Motor | publisher = Unique Cars and Parts | accessdate = 2007-05-09}}</ref> After the slow-selling HD series of 1965, Holden responded with the HR in 1966, selling over 250,000&nbsp;units in two years. Changes came in the form of new front and rear styling and higher-capacity engines. More significantly, the HR fitted standard front [[seat belt]]s; Holden thus became the first Australian automaker to provide the safety device as standard equipment across all models.<ref>Davis, Kennedy, Kennedy (Part Two), p. 57</ref> This coincided with the completion of the production plant in [[Acacia Ridge, Queensland]].<ref name = "milestones"/>   

[[Image:1968-1971 Holden Brougham 01.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Holden Brougham]] (1968–1971) was Holden's first full-size luxury vehicle; based on the mainstream [[Holden Kingswood|Kingswood]].]]

Holden began assembling the [[Compact car|compact]] HA series [[Vauxhall Viva]] in 1964. This was superseded by the [[Holden Torana]] in 1967, a development of the Viva ending Vauxhall production in Australia.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_torana_hb.htm | title = Holden Torana HB | publisher = Unique Cars and Parts | accessdate = 2008-03-06}}</ref> Holden offered the LC, a Torana with new styling, in 1969 with the availability of Holden's six-cylinder engine. In the development days, the six-cylinder Torana was reserved for [[Auto racing|motor racing]], but research had shown that there was a business case for such a model.<ref>Wright (1998), p. 191–192</ref>

Holden's long tradition of manufacturing [[Chevrolet]]s and [[Pontiac]]s ended in 1968, coinciding with Holden's next major new model, the HK.<ref>Davis, Kennedy, Kennedy (Part One), p. 5, 31</ref> This included Holden's first [[V8 engine]], a [[Chevrolet]] engine imported from the United States.<ref>Davis, Kennedy, Kennedy (Part Two), p. 59</ref> Models based on the HK series included an extended-length prestige model, the [[Holden Brougham|Brougham]], and a two-door [[coupé]], the [[Holden Monaro|Monaro]].<ref>Davis (1987), p. 102</ref> The mainstream [[Holden Special]] was rebranded the [[Holden Kingswood|Kingswood]], and the basic [[Fleet vehicle|fleet model]], the [[Holden Standard|Standard]], became the [[Holden Kingswood|Belmont]].<ref>Wright (1998), p. 171</ref> The first Australian-designed and mass-produced V8 engine debuted in the Hurricane concept of 1969, before being applied to facelifted HT model. This was available in two capacities: {{convert|253|cuin|L|1|lk=in}} referred to as a 4.2L and {{convert|308|cuin|L|1}}.<ref>{{cite web | date = [[1999-06-28]] | url = http://www.autoweb.com.au/A_51435/cms/newsarticle.html | title = Holden Employees Farewell The Last Aussie-Built V8 | work = AutoWeb | publisher = Web Publications | accessdate = 2008-03-05}}</ref>

Despite the arrival of serious competitors—namely the Ford Falcon, [[Chrysler Valiant]], and [[Japan]]ese cars—in the 1960s, Holden's locally produced large six- and eight-cylinder cars remained Australia's top-selling vehicles. Sales were boosted by exporting the Kingswood sedan, station wagon, and utility body styles to places such as [[Indonesia]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], and [[South Africa]] in [[complete knock down]] form.<ref>Davis, Kennedy, Kennedy (Part One), p. 31</ref>

[[Image:1971-1974 Holden HQ Kingswood sedan 01.jpg|thumb|left|Holden's HQ series sold in record numbers, with more than 480,000&nbsp;units shifted throughout the car's lifetime.]]

=== 1970s ===
In 1970, Holden transformed the [[Woodville, South Australia]] factory into an AU$16.5&nbsp;million ''Tri-Matic'' automatic transmission plant.<ref name = "milestones"/> The new three-speed transmission debuted in the HG series.<ref>Wright (1998), p. 194</ref> The following year, Holden launched the new [[Holden Kingswood#HQ|HQ]] series.<ref name = "Strauss 11">Strauss (1998), p. 11</ref> At this time, the company was producing all of its passenger cars in Australia, and every model was of Australian design; however, by the end of the decade, Holden was producing cars based on overseas designs. The HQ was thoroughly re-engineered, featuring a perimeter frame and semi-[[monocoque]] (unibody) construction. Other firsts included an all-coil suspension and an extended wheelbase for station wagons, while the utilities and panel vans retained the traditional coil/leaf suspension configuration.<ref>{{cite web | date = [[1998-10-26]] | url = http://www.autoweb.com.au/A_50813/cms/newsarticle.html | title = Golden Holden Oldies - Stars of the Seventies | work = AutoWeb | publisher = Web Publications | accessdate = 2008-03-05}}</ref> The series included the new prestige [[Statesman (automobile)|Statesman]] brand, which also had a longer wheelbase replacing the [[Holden Brougham|Brougham]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/0BF19BA5E77986D6CA256D2100149EA4 | title = Car review - Holden Statesman V6 sedan | work = GoAuto | publisher = John Mellor | accessdate = 2008-03-05}}</ref> The Statesman remains noteworthy because it was not marketed as a "Holden", but rather a "Statesman".<ref>{{cite journal | last = Luck | first = Rob | month = September | year = 1971 | title = Bold New Breed | journal = [[Motor (magazine)|Modern Motor]] | pages = 62 | publisher = Modern Magazines (Holdings)}}</ref>, this model was also exported as a Chevrolet to foreign markets. The HQ framework led to a new generation of two-door [[Holden Monaro|Monaros]], and, despite the introduction of the similar sized competitors, the HQ range became the top-selling Holden of all time, with 485,650&nbsp;units sold in three years.<ref>Davis, Kennedy, Kennedy (Part Two), p. 67–68</ref>

The next development of the Torana was the LH series, introduced in 1974 offered only as a four-door sedan.<ref name = "Wright 340">Wright (1998), p. 340</ref> The LH Torana was one of the few cars worldwide engineered to occupy four-, six-and eight-cylinder engines.<ref>Wright (1998), p. 198</ref> This trend continued until Holden introduced the [[Holden Sunbird|Sunbird]] in 1976; essentially the four-cylinder Torana with a new name.<ref name = "Wright 340"/> Designated LX, both the Sunbird and Torana introduced a three-door hatchback variant.<ref>Wright (1998), p. 244</ref>

[[Image:1978-1980 Holden VB Commodore 01.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Holden Commodore|Commodore]] followed the success of its forbear, the [[Holden Kingswood|Kingswood]], becoming Holden's bestselling vehicle to date.]]

In 1975, Holden introduced the [[Subcompact car|subcompact]] [[Isuzu Gemini|Gemini]], the Australian version of the "[[GM T platform|T-Car]]", based on the [[Opel Kadett]] C. The Gemini was an overseas design developed jointly with [[Isuzu]], GM's Japanese affiliate; and was powered by a 1.6&nbsp;litre four-cylinder engine.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_gemini_tx.htm | title = Holden Gemini TX | publisher = Unique Cars and Parts | accessdate = 2007-05-11}}</ref> Fast becoming a popular car, the Gemini rapidly attained sales leadership in its class, and the nameplate lived on until 1987.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_gemini_rb.htm | title = Holden Gemini RB | publisher = Unique Cars and Parts | accessdate = 2007-05-11}}</ref>

Holden's most popular car to date, the [[Holden Commodore|Commodore]], was introduced in 1978 as the [[Holden VB Commodore|VB]].<ref>Tuckey (1999), p. 27</ref> The new family car was loosely based on the [[Opel Rekord]] E body shell, but with the front from the [[Opel Senator]] grafted to accommodate the larger Holden six-cylinder and V8 engines. Initially, the Commodore maintained Holden's sales leadership in Australia.<ref>Tuckey (1999), p. 33</ref> However, some of the compromises resulting from the adoption of a design intended for another market hampered the car's acceptance. In particular, it was narrower than its predecessor and its Falcon rival, making it less comfortable for three rear-seat passengers.<ref name = "Robinson 22, 26-27">Robinson (2006), p. 23, 26-27</ref>

Holden discontinued the Torana in 1979 and the Sunbird in 1980. After the 1978 introduction of the Commodore, the Torana became the "in-between" car, surrounded by the smaller and more economical [[Isuzu Gemini|Gemini]] and the larger, more sophisticated Commodore. The closest successor to the Torana was the [[Holden Camira|Camira]], released in 1982 as Australia's version of GM's medium-sized "[[GM J platform|J-Car]]".<ref name = "Robinson 24">Robinson (2006), p. 24</ref>

[[Image:Holden Calais (1988-1991 VN series) 02.jpg|thumb|left|The second generation [[Holden Commodore|Commodore]] ''([[Holden VN Commodore#Calais|VN Calais]] pictured)'' overcame the previous generations' width problems.]]

=== 1980s ===
The 1980s were challenging for Holden and the Australian car industry. The Australian Government tried to revive the industry with the [[Button car plan]], which encouraged car makers to focus on producing fewer models at higher, more economical volumes, and to export cars.<ref>Wright (1998), p. 277</ref> The decade opened with the shut-down of the [[Pagewood, New South Wales]] production plant and introduction of the light commercial [[Holden Rodeo|Rodeo]], sourced from Isuzu in Japan.<ref name = "milestones"/> The Rodeo was available in both two- and four-wheel drive [[chassis cab]] models with a choice of [[Gasoline|petrol]] and [[diesel]] powerplants.<ref>Davis, Kennedy, Kennedy (Part Two), p. 82</ref> The range was updated in 1988 with the TF series, based on the [[Isuzu TF]].<ref name = "milestones"/>

Holden introduced the new [[Holden Kingswood#WB|WB]] series utilities, panel vans and limousines in 1980. However, the design, based on the HQ and updated [[Holden Kingswood#HJ|HJ]], [[Holden Kingswood#HX|HX]] and [[Holden Kingswood#HZ|HZ]] models from the 1970s could not compete with similar models in [[Ford Motor Company|Ford's]] lineup. Thus, Holden abandoned those [[Car classification|vehicle classes]] all together in 1984.<ref name = "Strauss 11"/> Sales of the [[Holden Commodore|Commodore]] also fell, with the effects of the [[1979 energy crisis]] lessening, and for the first time the Commodore lost ground to the [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Ford Falcon]]. Sales in other segments also suffered when competition from Ford intensified, and other Australian manufacturers: [[Mitsubishi Motors Australia|Mitsubishi]], [[Nissan Motors|Nissan]] and [[Toyota]] gained market share.<ref>{{cite web | last = Kenwright | first = Joe | date = [[2006-07-29]] | url = http://editorial.carsales.com.au/car-review/1916079.aspx | title = Crossing the Lion | publisher = carsales.com.au | accessdate = 2007-06-16}}</ref> When released in 1982, the [[Holden Camira|Camira]] initially generated good sales, which later declined because buyers considered the 1.6&nbsp;litre engine underpowered, and the car's build and ride quality below-average.<ref name = "Robinson 24"/> The Camira lasted just seven years, and contributed to Holden's accumulated losses of over AU$500&nbsp;million by the mid-1980s.<ref>Robinson (2006), p. 26</ref>

[[Image:1983-1984 Statesman WB II Caprice 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Statesman (automobile)|Statesman]] marque lasted until 1984, when Holden abandoned the full-size luxury segment.]]

In 1984, Holden introduced the [[Holden VK Commodore|VK Commodore]], with significant styling changes from the previous [[Holden VH Commodore|VH]]. The Commodore was next updated in 1986 as the [[Holden VL Commodore|VL]], which had new front and rear styling.<ref>Davis, Kennedy, Kennedy (Part Two), p. 89–94</ref> Controversially, the VL was powered by the 3.0&nbsp;litre [[Nissan RB engine#RB30|Nissan ''RB30'']] six-cylinder engine and had an electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission. The engine change was necessitated by the legal requirement that all new cars sold in Australia after 1986 had to consume unleaded petrol.<ref>{{cite web | date = [[2007-06-21]] | url = http://www.epa.qld.gov.au/environmental_management/air/caring_for_our_air/ | title = Caring for our air | publisher = [[Government of Queensland|State of Queensland]] | accessdate = 2007-07-11}}</ref> Because it was infeasible to convert the existing six-cylinder engine to run on unleaded fuel, the Nissan engine was chosen as the best engine available. However, changing exchange rates caused the cost of the engine and transmission to double over the life of the VL.<ref>Robinson (2006), p. 25</ref> The decision to opt for a Japanese-made transmission led to the closure of the [[Woodville, South Australia]] assembly plant. This came after Holden reorganised and recapitalised the business in 1985; separating the engine and car manufacturing divisions in the process.<ref name = "Robinson 27">Robinson (2006), p. 27</ref> For the most part, car bodies were now manufactured at [[Elizabeth, South Australia]], with engines confined to a single plant in [[Port Melbourne, Victoria]].

=== 1990s ===
The company changed throughout the 1990s, increasing its Australian market share from 21&nbsp;percent in 1991 to 28.2&nbsp;percent in 1999.<ref name = "Sales and Share of Australian Market Archive (1991-2002)">{{cite web | url = http://media.gm.com/aus/holden/en/company/finance/fin_sales_share_ARCHIVE.html | title = Sales and Share of Australian Market Archive (1991-2002) | publisher = [[General Motors]] | accessdate = 2007-11-21}}</ref> Besides manufacturing Australia's bestselling car, which was exported in significant numbers, Holden continued to export many locally produced engines to power cars made elsewhere. In this decade, Holden adopted a strategy of importing cars it needed to offer a full range of competitive vehicles.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gm.com/company/corp_info/global_operations/asia_pacific/aust.html | title = GM Global Operations: Australia | publisher = [[General Motors]] | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070427004252/http://www.gm.com/company/corp_info/global_operations/asia_pacific/aust.html | archivedate = 2005-10-25}}</ref> 

On [[April 26]], [[1990]], GM's New Zealand subsidiary, [[Holden New Zealand]], announced that production at the assembly plant based in [[Trentham, New Zealand|Trentham]] would be phased out and that vehicles would be imported [[Duty (economics)|duty]]-free. This came after the 1984 closure of the [[Petone]] assembly line due to low output volumes.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.holden.co.nz/heart/heritage/ | title = Heart of Holden - Holden Heritage | publisher = [[Holden New Zealand]] | accessdate = 2007-05-27}}</ref> During the 1990s Holden, other Australian automakers and [[trade union]]ists pressured the Australian Government to halt the lowering of car import [[tariff]]s. By 1997, the federal government had already cut tariffs to 22.5&nbsp;percent from 57.5&nbsp;percent ten years earlier, and by 2000 were planning to reduce this even further down to 15&nbsp;percent. Holden was critical, saying that Australia's population was not large enough, and that the changes could tarnish the local industry.<ref>{{cite web | last = Richardson | first = Michael | date = [[1997-04-24]] | url = http://www.iht.com/articles/1997/04/24/cars.t_0.php | title = Automakers Say Cuts in Duties Would Maim Industry : Tussle on Tariffs in Australia | work = [[International Herald Tribune]] | publisher = [[The New York Times Company]] | accessdate = 2007-11-23}}</ref>

Holden re-introduced its defunct [[Statesman (automobile)|Statesman]] name in 1990, this time under the Holden marque, as the [[Holden Statesman|Statesman and Caprice]]. For 1991, Holden updated the Statesman and Caprice with a range of improvements, including the introduction of four-wheel [[Anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]],<ref>Wright (1998), p. 343</ref> although a rear-wheel system had been standard on the Statesman Caprice from March 1976.<ref name = "Wright 340"/> This feature was added to short-wheelbase Commodore range in 1992.<ref>Davis, Kennedy, Kennedy (Part Two), p. 103–104</ref> Another returning variant was the full-size utility, this time based on the Commodore.<ref>Robinson (2006), p. 26–27</ref> The [[Holden VN Commodore|VN Commodore]] received a major facelift in 1993 with the [[Holden VR Commodore|VR]]. Compared to the VN, approximately 80&nbsp;percent of car was new. Exterior changes brought an overall smoother body and a "twin-kidney" [[grille]]&mdash;a Commodore styling trait which remained until the 2002 [[Holden VY Commodore|VY]] model.<ref>{{cite web | last = Smith | first = Graham | date = [[2002-09-06]] | url = http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,20384,5037260-26236,00.html | title = 1993 Holden VR Commodore | work = [[Herald Sun]] | publisher = [[News Limited]] | accessdate = 2008-03-02}}</ref> Holden introduced the all-new [[Holden VT Commodore|VT Commodore]] in 1997, the outcome of an AU$600&nbsp;million development programme that spanned more than half a decade.

=== 2000s ===
Holden's market surge from the 1990s reversed in the 2000s.

The campaign publicised that "For the first time ever, all Australians can enjoy the financial benefit of Holden Employee Pricing". However, this did not include a discounted dealer delivery fee and savings on factory fitted options and accessories that employees received. At the same time, employees were given a further discount between 25 and 29&nbsp;percent on selected models.<ref>{{cite web | date = [[2006-04-19]] | url = http://www.accc.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/732368/fromItemId/2332 | title = Holden employee pricing backfires | publisher = [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]] | accessdate = 2008-01-28}}</ref>

The [[Holden VT Commodore|VT Commodore]] received its first major update in 2002 with the [[Holden VY Commodore|VY]] series.

Since the 1960s, Holden models have been a staple of domestic [[touring car racing]], and the quasi-factory [[Holden Racing Team]] (HRT) has successfully participated in [[V8 Supercars|V8 Supercar]] racing.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.hsv.com.au/racing/2004/history/history.htm | title = Holden Racing Team History | publisher = [[Holden Special Vehicles]] | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060823045603/http://www.hsv.com.au/racing/2004/history/history.htm | archivedate = 2006-08-23}}</ref> In 1987, [[Holden Special Vehicles]] (HSV) was formed in partnership with Tom Walkinshaw, who primarily manufactures modified, high-performance Commodore variants.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.hsv.com.au/studentpack/spackhistory.htm | title = HSV History & Background | publisher = [[Holden Special Vehicles]] | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.hsv.com.au/studentpack/spackhistory.htm | archivedate = 2005-07-22}}</ref> To further reinforce the brand, HSV introduced the [[HSV Dealer Team]] into the V8 Supercar fold in 2005 under the naming rights of HSV Toll Racing.<ref>{{cite web | date = [[2005-11-21]] | url = http://www.hsvdt.com.au/hsvdt_new/2006/news/toll_hsvdt_release.asp | title = Toll and HSV Dealer Team confirm V8 Supercar alliance | publisher = [[HSV Dealer Team]] | accessdate = 2008-02-20}}</ref>

The logo, or "Holden lion and stone" as it is known, has played a vital role in establishing Holden's identity. In 1928, Holden's Motor Body Builders appointed [[Rayner Hoff]] to design the emblem. The logo refers to a [[prehistory|prehistoric]] fable, in which observations of [[lion]]s rolling stones led to the invention of the wheel. With the 1948 launch of the [[Holden 48-215|48-215]], Holden revised its logo and commissioned another redesign in 1972 to better represent the company.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Wright | first = John | month = May | year = 2004 | title = Badgeology | journal = [[Wheels magazine]] | pages = 152 | publisher = [[ACP Magazines]]}}</ref> The emblem was reworked once more in 1994.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.holden.com.au/www-holden/jsp/corporateinfo/history/history.jsp?link=symbol | title = The Story of the Holden Lion | publisher = GM Holden | accessdate = 2007-07-12}}</ref>
