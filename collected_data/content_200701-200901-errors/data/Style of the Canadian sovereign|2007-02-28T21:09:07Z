The style '''Queen of Canada''' is held by the [[Monarchy in Canada|Canadian Monarch]] during the reign of a female sovereign. During the reign of a male sovereign, the title would change accordingly to '''King of Canada'''.  It is expected that upon the [[demise of the Crown]], the current [[heir apparent]], [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]], will be proclaimed King of Canada by the [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada]] (which would then be the King's Privy Council).

The style came into use for the first time with the passing of the ''[[Royal Style and Titles Act]]'' in 1953, which put into practice the principals of the 1931 [[Statute of Westminster, 1931|''Statute of Westminster'']].  Through the Act, passed by the [[Parliament of Canada|Canadian Parliament]], the Queen accorded herself the title "Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom, Canada and Her other Realms and Territories Queen, [[Head of the Commonwealth]], [[Defender of the Faith]]."  For the first time the official Canadian title mentioned Canada separately from the United Kingdom and the other Realms, to highlight the Monarch's role specifically as Queen of Canada, as well as the shared aspect of the Crown throughout the Realms.

Elizabeth II refers to herself as Queen of Canada when in, or acting abroad on behalf of, Canada.  For example, she stated in 1973: "But it is as Queen of Canada that I am here, Queen of Canada and of all Canadians, not just of one or two ancestral strains."  The federal government and provincial governments now promote the title Queen of Canada, illustrating the separation between Elizabeth II's positions as Queen of Canada and Queen of the United Kingdom.<ref>[http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/about/people/senate//Monarchy/SenMonarchy_15-e.htm Canada: a Constitutional Monarchy]</ref> <ref>[http://canada.gc.ca/howgoc/queen/quind_e.html Biography: Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II Queen of Canada]</ref> <ref>[http://www.gr.gov.sk.ca/protocol/Practice/crown_in_canada.htm The Crown in Canada]</ref>  The style "Queen of Canada" is included in the [[Oath of Allegiance (Canada)|Oath of Allegiance]], as well as the [[Oath of citizenship (Canada)|Oath of Citizenship]].

==Highness and Majesty==
The use of the styles "Highness" and "Majesty" originated in the United Kingdom, where they were used from the [[12th century]] onward.  During the reign of [[James I of England|James VI of Scots and I of England and Ireland]], however, "Majesty" became the official title, to the exclusion of others.

The style was imported to Canada during colonial times, through usage in reference to the [[British Monarchy|British Monarch]], who then had sovereignty over the [[British North America|British North American]] colonies and provinces.  Its usage continued after Canada became a sovereign kingdom between 1931 and the [[Patriation|patriation of the Canadian constitution]] in 1982, and is now applied to the Canadian Monarch.

Unlike in the United Kingdom, where the Sovereign is referred to in [[treaties]] and on British [[passport]]s as "Her [His] Britannic Majesty", the Sovereign in Canada is referred to simply as "Her [His] Majesty."  However, from time to time, the style will be "Her [His] Canadian Majesty" as to differentiate from foreign sovereigns.
