'''Roslyn''' is an [[unincorporated area|unincorporated community]] in [[Abington Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Abington Township]], [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery County]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]]. Originally called Hillside, the name Roslyn came from rose gardens that once grew there.<ref name=ggcc>{{cite web|url=http://www.glensidechamber.org/communty.htm |title=A Brief History of Roslyn Valley |work=[http://www.glensidechamber.org/ Greater Glenside Chamber of Commerce website] |accessdate=2008-08-23 }}</ref>

The first known person of European descent to settle the area was John Tyson, who bought a tract of land here in 1717. He built [[lime kiln]]s to turn the abundant local limestone into [[Calcium oxide|quicklime]], starting an industry that operated into the late 20th century.<ref name=ggcc/>

The first rail connection to Roslyn was built by the Northeast Pennsylvania Railroad in 1873.<ref name=eprrh>{{cite web|url=http://www.earlpleasants.com/search_1.asp| title=Search 1 |work=Earl Pleasants' Railroad History Database | accessdate=2008-08-23}}</ref> Today's [[Roslyn (SEPTA station)|station]], which replaced the original in the 1960s, is on [[SEPTA]]'s [[R2_(SEPTA)#R2_Warminster|R2 Warminster]] line.<ref name=septa>{{cite web|url=http://www.septa.org/maps/click_map/roslyn.html | title =SEPTA Roslyn Station | work=[[SEPTA]] website |accessdate=2008-08-23}}</ref>

Children in the community attend Roslyn Elementary School, one of the seven public elementary schools that make up [[Abington School District]], or St. John of the Cross Elementary, a private school.<ref name=abington>{{cite web| url=http://www.abington.org/info/communities_roslyn.htm| title=Township Information: Communities (Roslyn)| work=[http://www.abington.org/ Abington Township website] |accessdate=2008-08-23 }}</ref>
