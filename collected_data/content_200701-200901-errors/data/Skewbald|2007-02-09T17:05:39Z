The '''Skewbald''' [[horse]] has a coat made up of brown (or any color besides black) and white patches, on top of either pink or black skin.  It is similar in appearance to the [[piebald]] and [[oddbald]] horses. While the term is seldom used in the United States, and if used, refers generically to any brown and white spotted horse, in the United Kingdom, it is typically used in reference to a manifestation of the [[Tobiano]] gene.<br>
Like the [[piebald]] and [[oddbald]], these terms are now no longer in common use in the UK and are more correctly referred to as ''Coloured.''  In the United States, the terminology is seldom used at all, and all such spotted horses are simply called [[pinto horse|Pinto]], or if in reference to a certain breed, [[American Paint Horse|Paint]].
