[[Image:Canada 2006 Federal Election seats.png|thumb| The initial seat distribution of the 39th Canadian Parliament]]


The '''39th Canadian Parliament''' is the current [[Parliament of Canada]], and has been in session since [[April 3]], [[2006]].  The membership was set by the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 federal election]] on [[January 23]], [[2006]], and it has changed only somewhat due to resignations and [[by-elections]].  The longest it could run, barring war or national emergency, is until [[October 19]], [[2009]] due to Bill C-16, passed by this Parliament.  Historically, however, [[minority government]]s in Canada such as the current one have rarely lasted more than two years.

It is controlled by a [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]] minority, led by [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] and the [[28th Canadian Ministry]], which assumed power on [[February 6]], [[2006]].  The [[Official Opposition (Canada)|Official Opposition]] is the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]], led first by interim leader [[Bill Graham]], and currently by [[Stéphane Dion]].

The [[Speaker of the Canadian House of Commons|Speaker]] is Liberal [[Peter Milliken]].  Milliken was re-elected as the Speaker of the House for the 39th Parliament on [[April 3]], [[2006]]. The Speaker only votes in a tie, and, as Milliken is a Liberal, the Liberal caucus is effectively reduced by one.  This, along with the defection of [[Wajid Khan]] to the Conservatives enables the Conservatives to pass legislation with the cooperation of any one of the three [[opposition parties]]: [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]], [[Bloc Québécois|Bloc]], or [[New Democratic Party]] (NDP).

There has been only one [[Parliamentary session|session]] of the 39th Parliament:

==Major events==
===Floor-crossing===
Four members of parliament have [[crossing the floor|crossed the floor]] since the election: 

On [[February 6]], [[2006]] [[David Emerson]], elected as the Liberal [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Vancouver Kingsway]], crossed the floor to join Stephen Harper's cabinet as Minister of International Trade.

On [[January 5]], [[2007]] [[Wajid Khan]], elected as the Liberal [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Mississauga—Streetsville]], crossed the floor to join the Harper government.

On [[February 6]], [[2007]] [[Garth Turner]], elected as a Conservative MP for [[Halton (electoral district)|Halton]], moved to the Liberal caucus.  He had been sitting as an Independent since being suspended from the Tory caucus on [[October 18]], [[2006]].

On [[June 26]], [[2007]] [[Joe Comuzzi]], elected as a Liberal MP for [[Thunder Bay&mdash;Superior North]], moved to the Conservative caucus.  He had been sitting as an Independent since being suspended from the Liberal caucus on [[March 21]], [[2007]].[http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070626/Joe_Comuzzi_07626/20070626?hub=Canada]

===Liberal leadership===
During the election campaign, the Liberal leader was then Prime Minister [[Paul Martin]].   After the election results were announced, Liberal leader [[Paul Martin]] announced his intention to resign, but did not indicate when, other than saying he would not lead the party into the next election. On [[February 1]], the Liberal Party Caucus chose [[Bill Graham (politician)|Bill Graham]] as [[parliamentary leader]], meaning he served as [[Leader of the Opposition (Canada)|Leader of the Opposition]] in the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]] until the election of [[Stéphane Dion]] as Liberal leader at the next Liberal Party leadership convention, held [[December 2]] through [[December 3]].

Some political observers had questioned whether Martin would have led the Liberals into an election had the Harper minority fallen in the first few months of the 39th Parliament.[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20060202.LIBERALS02/TPStory/?query=].  In 1979,  [[Pierre Trudeau]]'s Liberals lost to [[Joe Clark]]'s [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservatives]] who only won a minority on [[May 22]] of that year. The Clark minority was defeated less than seven months after on a [[motion of no confidence|confidence vote]] over the budget, which was much earlier than most observers had expected the government to fall. Trudeau had announced his resignation as leader of the Liberals on [[November 21]], [[1979]]; however in light of the collapse of the government on [[December 13]], [[1979]], and the Liberal Party's not having chosen a replacement as leader, Trudeau was persuaded to change his mind, and he led the party into the [[Canadian federal election, 1980|1980 election]] winning a [[majority government]]. Unlike Martin, Trudeau did not appoint an [[interim leader]] or withdraw from the day-to-day leadership of the party after announcing he would resign. 

On [[March 18]], [[2006]] Martin officially tendered his resignation as Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada. This move was widely seen as a move by Martin to stop any talk of him leading the party into the next election.

===Five priorities===
Prime Minister Harper has said he will move forward with his top five priorities from the campaign.  At least four of these will require legislative action: the passage of a ''[[Federal Accountability Act]]'' in response to the [[sponsorship scandal]]; combating crime by creating more police officers and setting longer [[mandatory sentencing|mandatory sentences]]; lowering the [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|Goods & Services Tax]] to 6% (and eventually to 5%); giving $1,200 for parents per child under the age of 6.  On [[December 6]], [[2006]], another issue many expected to arise in the first session of parliament did, in fact, come to the fore, when the government introduced a motion calling "on the government to introduce legislation to restore the traditional definition of marriage without affecting civil unions and while respecting existing same-sex marriages." [http://www.pco-bcp.gc.ca/lgc/default.asp?Language=E&Page=newsroom&Sub=speeches&Doc=20061207_marriage_e.htm]  The next day, the House defeated the motion by a vote of 175 to 123, with six cabinet ministers voting against it, and Harper declared the issue settled.[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20061208.SAMESEX08/TPStory/?query=%22same-sex+marriage%22] (See [[Members of the 39th Canadian Parliament and same-sex marriage]] for more information.)

===Jean Lapierre's resignation===
Just a week after [[Wajid Khan]]'s defection to the [[Conservative Party of Canada]], [[Outremont (federal electoral district)|Outremont's]] Liberal MP [[Jean Lapierre]] declared on [[January 11]], [[2007]] that he would resign from the Liberal Party at the end of the month to pursue a career in television. This took place on [[January 28]], leaving the [[Outremont (federal electoral district)|Outremont]] district vacant, and further weakening the Liberal Party by reducing their number of seats to 100. The Liberal seat count has since risen to 101, with independent MP Garth Turner (former Conservative MP) of the [[Halton (electoral district)|Halton]] district joining the Liberal Party on [[February 6]], [[2007]].

On [[21 February]] [[2007]], [[Yvan Loubier]] (representing [[Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot]] for the [[Bloc Québécois]]) resigned in order to run in the [[Quebec general election, 2007]].

==Major bills and motions==
Important business of the 39th Parliament includes the following [[Bill (proposed law)|bills]] and [[Motion (democracy)|motions]].  Note that not all of these bills have yet become law.  Motions (excepting those which pass bills) have no effect in law.  A [http://www.parl.gc.ca/LEGISINFO/index.asp?Language=E complete lists of bills] of the 1st session of the 39th Parliament is on the Parliament's website.  The bills are divided into government bills, [[private member's bill]]s, and [[private bill]]s for both the House and the Senate.

===Acts passed by 39th Parliament===
=====Federal Accountability Act=====
Bill C-2, the [[Federal Accountability Act]] (officially ''"An Act providing for conflict of interest rules, restrictions on election financing and measures respecting administrative transparency, oversight and accountability"''), received [[royal assent]] in the Senate on [[December 12]], [[2006]], and is now becoming law.  The act plans to reduce the opportunity to exert influence with money by banning corporate, union, and large personal political donations; create a five-year lobbying ban on former ministers, their aides, and senior public servants; provide protection for whistleblowers; and enhancing the power for the Auditor General to follow the money spent by the government.

=====Extending the Afghan War until 2009=====
A successful motion in the House to extend Canada's [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|mission in Afghanistan]] by two years, until early 2009.  The motion was supported by the Conservatives and 30 Liberal MPs, allowing it to narrowly pass 149-145 on [[May 17]], [[2006]].<ref>{{Cite news |author=CBC News |publisher=CBC.ca |title=Canada's stay in Afghanistan extended by 2 years |date=May 17, 2006 |accessdate=2006-12-13 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/05/17/afghandebate05172006.html}}</ref>

=====Quebecois nationhood=====
A successful motion in the House to recognise the [[Québécois]] as a [[Québec nationalism|nation within a united Canada]].  The motion was put forth by the [[Stephen Harper|Prime Minister]] in reaction to an announced motion by [[Bloc Quebecois]] leader [[Gilles Duceppe ]] that would recognise Quebec as a nation, but did not contain the words “in Canada” .<ref>{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Sheppard |work=In Depth: The 39th Parliament |title=Quebec nationalism, a long history |publisher=CBC.ca |date=November 23, 2006 |accessdate=2006-12-11 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/parliament39/quebecnation-history.html}}</ref>  The motion easily passed 266 to 16, with all party leaders voting in favour, including Duceppe<ref>{{Cite news |author=CBC News |work=In Depth: The 39th Parliament |title=How each MP voted on Québécois nationhood |publisher=CBC.ca |date=November 28, 2006 |accessdate=2006-12-11 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/parliament39/quebecnation-mpvotes.html}}</ref>

=====Reaffirming the Kyoto Protocol=====
A motion passed by the opposition parties (161 for to 115 against) on [[February 5]], [[2007]] to reaffirm Canada's commitment to the [[Kyoto Protocol]].<ref>{{cite news | author = CBC News | title = House motion passes supporting Kyoto | url = http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/02/05/kyoto-vote.html | publisher = cbc.ca | date = [[2007-02-05]] | accessdate = 2007-02-05}}</ref>  The motion may not have any legal effect, but it is related to [[39th Canadian Parliament#Kyoto Protocol Implementation Act|Bill C-288]] -- which is on third reading stage in the Senate.

=====Fixed election dates=====
{{wikinews|Fixed election dates to become law in Canadian federal elections}}
Bill C-16, titled ''"An Act to amend the Canada Elections Act"'', is a bill to set fixed election dates.  If passed, elections will be held on the third Monday in October in the fourth calendar year following polling day for the last general election.  The next general election under this act would be held on [[October 19]], [[2009]].  Parliament could still be dissolved by a [[motion of non-confidence]].  The provinces of British Columbia, Ontario, and Newfoundland and Labrador have already implemented fixed election dates for their own provincial elections.  Bill C-16 passed in the House on [[November 6]], [[2006]] and the Senate on [[March 28]], [[2007]].  The House began discussing the amendments made in the Senate on [[April 21]], [[2007]]. The house voted down the amendments on [[April 24]], [[2007]]. [http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&Mode=1&Parl=39&Ses=1&DocId=2857890] On [[May 1]], [[2007]], the Senate chose not to insist on its amendment. The bill received royal assent on [[May 3]]. [http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&Mode=1&Parl=39&Ses=1&DocId=2896549]

===Failed acts and motions===
=====Re-opening the same-sex marriage debate=====
A failed government motion to reopen the [[same-sex marriage]] debate.  The [[38th Canadian Parliament]], led by the Liberals, had legalised same-sex marriage a year earlier, and many provinces before that.  Harper’s motion to reopen the issue was a promise he made while campaigning, but doing so would likely have been unconstitutional.  The motion failed 175-123, so the issue is closed, again, leaving same-sex marriage legal in Canada.<ref>{{Cite news |author=Canadian Press |authorlink=Canadian Press |publisher=CBC.ca |title=MPs vote against revisiting gay marriage issue |date=December 7, 2006 |accessdate=2006-12-11 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/cp/national/061207/n120751A.html}}</ref>

=====Extending anti-terror laws=====
A failed government motion (159 opposed to 124 in favour) to renew certain sunsetted provisions of the [[Canadian Anti-Terrorism Act|''Anti-terrorism Act'']], first passed by the Liberals after [[9/11]] that suspended some civil liberties in order to combat [[terrorism]].<ref>{{cite news |author=CBC News |title=MPs vote against extending anti-terrorism measures |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/02/27/terror-vote.html |work=CBC.ca |date=[[2007-02-28]] |accessdate=2007-02-28}}</ref>

===Acts not yet passed===
=====Eight-year Senate terms=====
Bill S-4, titled ''An Act to amend the Constitution Act, 1867 (Senate tenure)'' is a Senate bill to limit new [[Canadian Senate|Senators']] tenure to eight-year terms.  Currently, senators can stay in office until they reach the age of 75.  The bill was first introduced by the government in the Senate on [[May 30]], [[2006]].  After several months of debates, and consideration of the subject-matter by a special committee, the bill was read a second time on [[February 20]], [[2007]].  At the same time, it was referred to the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for consideration.  It will not proceed with its third reading until the Supreme Court of Canada has ruled with respect to its constitutionality.  It has been suggested that the Liberal Senate will modify the bill to extend the terms to twelve years so that a prime minister would not control the entire Senate after two parliaments.

=====Age of consent=====
Bill C-22, titled ''"An Act to amend the Criminal Code (age of protection) and to make consequential amendments to the Criminal Records Act"'', is a bill to raise the [[Ages of consent in North America|age of consent]] from 14 to 16.  The bill was read a second time and referred to committee on [[October 30]], [[2006]]. It was returned from committee on [[April 23]], [[2007]]. The bill was passed by the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]] on [[May 4]]. [http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&Mode=1&Parl=39&Ses=1&DocId=2903104]

=====Senate Appointment Consultations Act=====
Bill C-43, titled ''"An Act to provide for consultations with electors on their preferences for appointments to the Senate"'', is a bill to hold [[referendum]]s on Senate appointments, introduced [[December 13]], [[2006]].<ref>{{Cite news |author=CTV.ca News Staff |publisher=CTV.ca |title=PM to bring 'democracy' to choice of senators |date=December 13, 2006 |accessdate=2006-12-13 |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20061213/senate_elexn_061213/20061213?hub=TopStories}}</ref>  The bill is opposed by Liberals and has stalled after the [[first reading]].

=====Expanding the House of Commons=====
Bill C-56, titled ''"An Act to amend the Constitution Act, 1867 (Democratic representation)"'' is a bill which would add 22 seats to the House of Commons. This would increase the number to 330 seats, although these seats probably will not be in use until at least 2014. Under the proposed plan, [[Ontario]] would gain 10 seats, [[British Columbia]] would get 7 seats, and [[Alberta]] would receive 5 seats. The act has stalled after the first reading.
