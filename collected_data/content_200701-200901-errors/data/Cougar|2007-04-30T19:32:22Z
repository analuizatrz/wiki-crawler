The '''cougar''' (''Puma concolor''), also known as the '''puma''' or '''mountain lion''', is a [[New World]] [[mammal]] of the [[Felidae]] family. This large, solitary cat has a vast range, extending from [[Yukon]] in [[Canada]] to the southern [[Andes]] of [[South America]]. An adaptable [[Generalist and specialist species|generalist]] species, the cougar is found in every major New World [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] type. Due to overhunting and continual human development of cougar habitat, populations have dropped in many parts of its historical range, although recent conservation efforts have allowed numbers to improve in some areas. 

There is a considerable variation in color and size of cougars across the large range of habitats. It is on average the second heaviest cat in the [[Americas]], after the [[jaguar]], and the fourth heaviest in the world, after the [[tiger]], [[lion]], and jaguar; the cougar is larger on average than the [[leopard]], but is not typically counted among the "[[big cats]]" as it cannot [[roar]] and is classified in the ''[[Puma]]'' [[genus]] rather than ''[[Panthera]].''

Capable as both a stalk-and-ambush and chase predator, the cougar pursues a wide-range of prey. Its primary food is [[deer]] but it also hunts [[insect]]s, [[mouse|mice]] and [[rabbit]]s, domestic [[cat]]s and [[dog]]s, [[alpaca]], [[livestock]], and also other large game such [[bighorn sheep]] and [[elk (Cervus canadensis)|elk]]. In the [[Rocky Mountains]] it sometimes preys on mature [[cattle]] and [[horse]]s. It is a secretive cat and usually avoids people; it has been known to attack humans, but rarely.<ref name=attacks>{{cite web | url = http://cougarinfo.com/attacks3.htm | title = List of Confirmed Cougar Attacks In the United States and Canada 2001 - Now}}</ref>

==Naming and etymology==
In the [[English language]] the cougar has over 40 names. Cougars are known by many regional names, including '''American lion''',  '''brown tiger''',  '''catamount''',  '''deer tiger''',  '''Florida panther''',  '''ghost cat''',  '''Indian devil''',  '''king cat''',  '''Mexican lion''',  '''mountain screamer''',  '''painter''',  '''panther''',  '''red lion''',  '''red panther''',  '''red tiger''',  '''silver lion''',  '''sneak cat''',  and '''painted cat'''. The word ''puma'' comes from the [[Quechua language]]. In Brazil it is also known as the '''suçuarana''', from the [[Tupi language]], but also has other names.

In North America, particularly the [[United States]], "panther" by itself refers to a cougar when the context implies a local species. In South America, "panther" refers to both the spotted and black color morphs of the [[jaguar]].

==Taxonomy==

The cougar is the largest of the small cats. While its bulk characteristics are similar to the species of ''Panthera'' it is more closely related to small and mid-sized felines. It was originally placed in ''[[Felis]]'', a genus which includes the [[domestic cat]], and was reviewed as such as late as 1983. It is now placed in the ''[[Puma]]'' genus along with the [[jaguarundi]], a cat just a little more than a tenth its weight. Culver ''et al.'' report that the cougar, jaguarundi, and [[African cheetah]] share a common ancestor dated to 5 to 8 [[Ma]].<ref name=Culver>{{cite journal | author = Culver, M. | coauthors =  Johnson, W.E., Pecon-Slattery, J., O'Brein, S.J. | date = 2000 | title = Genomic Ancestry of the American Puma | journal = Journal of Heredity | volume = 91 | issue = 3 | pages = 186-197 | url = http://www.coryi.org/Florida_panther/Miscellaneous_Panther_Material/Genomic%20ancestry%20of%20the%20American%20puma.pdf | format = PDF}}</ref> Johnson ''et al.'', writing in 2006, support the relationship between the three cats.<ref name=Johnson2006>{{cite journal | author = Johnson, W.E., Eizirik, E., Pecon-Slattery, J., Murphy, W.J., Antunes, A., Teeling, E. & O'Brien, S.J. | year = 2006 | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/311/5757/73 | title = The Late Miocene radiation of modern Felidae: A genetic assessment. | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 311 | pages = 73-77}}</ref> They note that the ''Puma'' lineage shares a clade with the ''[[Lynx]],'' leopard cat (''[[Prionailurus]]''), and domestic cat (''Felis'') lineages. A common ancestor of these and the ocelot lineage (''[[Leopardus]]'') is suggested to have migrated to the Americas between 8 and 8.5 Ma. The cheetah, after diverging from ''Puma'', migrated backwards. Taxonomic research on felids remains partial and should be treated cautiously; Johnson notes that "a large portion of felid evolutionary history is not represented in the fossil record."<ref name=Johnson2006/>

Up until the late 1990s, as many as 32 different subspecies were recorded, although Culver indicates that many of these supposed subspecies are too genetically similar to be retained as distinct. The study suggests that the original North American subspecies of ''Puma concolor'' became extinct during the Pleistocene extinctions some 10,000 years ago and that North America was then repopulated by South American cougars, leading to the genetic similarity of modern North American cougars.<ref name=Culver/> The canonical Mammal Species of the World (3rd) now recognizes six subspecies, following the research.<ref name=MSW3/>

==Physical characteristics==

The cougar is a slender and agile cat. The length of adult males is often reported at around 2.4&nbsp;m (8&nbsp;ft) long nose to tail, with overall ranges between 1.5–2.75&nbsp;m (5–9&nbsp;ft) nose to tail suggested for the species in general.<ref name=Texas>{{cite web |url=http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/huntwild/wild/species/mlion/ |title=Mountain Lion (''Puma concolor'') |accessdate=2007-03-30 |publisher=Texas Parks and Wildlife}}</ref><ref name=NY>{{cite web |url=http://www.dec.state.ny.us/website/dfwmr/wildlife/endspec/eacofs.html |title=Eastern Cougar Fact Sheet |accessdate=2007-03-30 |publisher=New York State Department of Environmental Conservation}}</ref> The higher end of this length range equals that of the jaguar, but the cougar is less muscled and powerful than its felid cousin. Males have an average weight of about 53–72&nbsp;kg (115–160&nbsp;lb). In rare cases, some may reach over 120&nbsp;kg (260&nbsp;lb). Female average weight is between 34–48&nbsp;kg (75–105 &nbsp;lb).<ref name=CAP/> Cougars are smallest close to the [[equator]], and populations increase in size as they approach the [[geographical pole|poles]].<ref name=diet>{{cite journal | author = J. Agustin Iriarte, William L. Franklin, Warren E. Johnson, and Kent H. Redford | year = 1990 | title = Biogeographic variation of food habits and body size of the America puma | journal = [[Oecologia]] | volume = 85 | issue = 2 | pages = 185 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/nvk62r701822qq17/ | accessdate = 2007-04-04}}</ref>

Cougar colouring is plain (Latin ''concolor'') but can vary greatly between individuals, and even between siblings. The coat is typically tawny, but ranges to silvery-grey or reddish,<ref name=CAP> Nowell, K. and Jackson, P. (compilers and editors) 1996. ''Wild Cats. Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan.'' ([http://carnivoractionplans1.free.fr/wildcats.pdf PDF]). IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group. IUCN, Gland, Switzerland.</ref> with lighter patches on the under body including the jaws, chin, and throat. Infants are spotted and born with blue eyes;<ref name=CAP/> juveniles are pale, and dark spots remain on their flanks.<ref name=NY/> The head of the cat is round and the ears erect. 

The cougar has large feet and proportionally the largest hind legs in the cat family.<ref name=CAP/> This physique allows for great leaping and short-sprint ability. ''[[Canadian Geographic]]'' and the [[San Diego Zoo]] report an exceptional vertical leap of 5.4&nbsp;m (18&nbsp;ft).<ref name=CanGeo>{{cite web |url=http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/Magazine/mj04/indepth/justthefacts.asp |title= Cougars in Canada (Just the Facts) |accessdate=2007-04-02 |publisher=[[Canadian Geographic Magazine]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sandiegozoo.org/animalbytes/t-puma.html |title= Mountain Lion (Puma, Cougar) |accessdate=2007-04-02 |work=San Diego Zoo.org |publisher=[[San Diego Zoo|Zoological Society of San Diego]]}}</ref> Horizontal jumping capability is suggested anywhere from 6 to 12&nbsp;m (20 to 40&nbsp;ft).
<!--The cougar can run as quickly as 70km/h (43.5&nbsp;mph), jump 6&nbsp;m (20&nbsp;ft) from a standing position, and vertically leap 2.5&nbsp;m (8&nbsp;ft).-->

Cougar claws are retractable and it has four toes, with a dew claw on its front paws. The cougar is somewhat smaller in South America, than in North America. Cougar kittens have brownish-blackish spots and rings on their tails. Their life span is about a decade in the wild and 25 years or more in captivity.

Although the cougar is frequently lumped in with larger cats, the cougar is distinct in that it cannot roar, and makes vocalizations much more common to small cats.

===Hybrids and melanism===

In spite of not being closely related to the [[pantherine (animal)|pantherine]] [[big cat]]s, hybrids between the cougar and the leopard have been bred and are called the [[pumapard]]. Hybrids between the cougar and the [[ocelot]] have also been bred. Hybrids between the cougar and the jaguar have been reported, but none have been proven.

In spite of anecdotal accounts of "[[black panther]]s" in the cougar's range (and outside the Jaguar's), [[melanism]] has never been documented in the cougar. Such anecdotal accounts are particularly prominent in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] of the eastern United States, a region where ''P. concolor'' is accepted as having been wholly extirpated by the late 1800s, and where breeding populations have not been documented as re-established by 2005.

==Hunting and diet==

This successful generalist predator will eat any animal it can catch, from insects through large [[ungulates]]. Like all cats, the cougar is an [[obligate carnivore]], feeding only on meat. The most important prey species for the cougar is deer, particularly in North America. [[Mule deer]], [[white-tailed deer]], [[elk (Cervus canadensis)|elk]], and even the large [[moose]] are taken by the cat. A survey of North America research found 68% of prey items were ungulates, especially deer (only the isolated Florida sub-species showed variation, often preferring feral [[Hog (swine)|hogs]] and [[armadillo]]s).<ref name=diet/> Investigation in [[Yellowstone National Park]] showed elk followed by mule deer were the cougar's primary targets; the prey base is shared with the park's wolves, with whom the cougar competes for resources.<ref name=Yellowstone>{{cite web | title = Wildlife: Wolves | publisher = [[Yellowstone National Park]] | url = http://www.yellowstonenationalpark.com/wolves.htm | accessdate = 2007-04-08}}<br>* {{cite web  | author = Holly Akenson, James Akenson, Howard Quigley | title = Winter Predation and Interactions of Wolves and Cougars on Panther Creek in Central Idaho| url = http://www.yellowstonenationalpark.com/wolves.htm}}<br>* {{cite web | author = John K. Oakleaf, Curt Mack, Dennis L. Murray | title = Winter Predation and Interactions of Cougars and Wolves in the Central Idaho Wilderness | url = http://www.yellowstonenationalpark.com/wolves.htm}}</ref> Another study on winter kills (November-April) in [[Alberta]] showed that ungulates accounted for greater than 99% of the cougar diet; learned, individual behaviour was observed, as some cougars rarely killed bighorn sheep, while others relied heavily on the species.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Ross | first = R.  | coauthors = Jalkotzy, MG., Festa-Bianchet, M. | date = May 1993 | title = Cougar predation on bighorn sheep in southwestern Alberta during winter | journal = Canadian Journal of Zoology | volume = 75 | issue = 5 | pages = 771-775 | url = http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&collection=ENV&recid=4321651 | accessdate = 2007-04-08}}</ref> 

In the Central and South American cougar range, the ratio of deer in the diet declines. Small to mid-size mammals are preferred, including large rodents such as the [[capybara]]. Ungulates accounted for only 35% of prey items in one survey, approximately half that of North America. Competition with the larger jaguar has been suggested for the decline in the size of prey items.<ref name=diet/> Other listed prey species of the cougar include [[mice]], [[porcupine]], [[hares]] and [[bighorn sheep]]. Birds and small reptiles are sometimes predated in the south, but this is rarely recorded in North America.<ref name=diet/>

Though quite capable of sprinting, the cougar is typically an ambush predator. It will stalk through brush and trees, across ledges, or other covered spots, before delivering a powerful leap onto the back of prey and a suffocating neck bite. It has a flexible spine which aids its killing technique. Kills are generally estimated at around one large ungulate every two weeks; the period shrinks for females raising young, and may be as short as one kill every three days when cubs are nearly mature around fifteen months.<ref name=CAP/>

==Population and distribution==
The cougar has the largest range of any wild cat. Before the modern human [[population explosion]] in the Americas, the cougar ranged across most of the Americas. Even now, it has the widest range of any [[New World]] land animal, spanning 110 [[Degree (angle)|degree]]s of [[latitude]], from northern [[Yukon]] in [[Canada]] to the southern [[Andes]] on both the [[Chilean]] and [[Argentinean]] sides. It has also been sighted recently in northern [[Connecticut]] and other parts of [[New England]], however, sightings are not generally regarded as reliable enough to serve as scientific evidence.<ref>{{cite web | title = Beyond Sightings to Signs | work = [http://www.easterncougar.org Eastern Cougar Foundation] | url = http://www.easterncougar.org/beyondsightings.htm | date = 2006-09-26}}</ref>  One of the few locations where the cougar is in great danger is within the United States, mainly [[Florida]] and other parts of the East Coast. This is mostly due to human infringement, clashing with cities and other urban advancements or because of the loss of territories that urbanization brings. When the cougar is found and relocated to more "wild" parts of the state, it is put into competition with pre-existing populations.

===Cougar populations of the United States and Canada===
Hunted almost to extinction in the United States and eastern Canada, the cougar has made a determined comeback, with an estimated 30,000 individuals in the western United States. In Canada, the cougar is found west of the [[Canadian Prairies|Prairies]], in [[Alberta]], [[British Columbia]] and southern Yukon. It is also found in smaller numbers within the [[Canadian Shield]] and river valley regions of [[Ontario]], [[Manitoba]] and [[Saskatchewan]]. They are occasionally seen in the mainland of southeastern [[Alaska]].{{Fact|date=March 2007}} The densest concentration of cougars in North America is found on [[Vancouver Island]] in British Columbia, while in the United States the densest concentration is in the [[Ventana Wilderness]] in the [[Los Padres National Forest]], California.<ref name=iucn/>

The cougar is gradually extending its range to the east, following [[Creek (stream)|creek]]s and riverbeds, and has reached [[Missouri]], [[Michigan]] and [[Kansas]]. In [[Texas]], the cougar is generally confined to the western ⅔ of the state. However, there have been Cougar sightings in 218 of the 254 Texas counties, with confirmed mortalities in 67 counties since 1983, an indication that it is expanding statewide to its historical range.<ref name=Texas/> There are continuing reports of the survival of a remnant population of the eastern cougar in [[Maine]], [[New Brunswick]], Ontario and the [[Gaspé Peninsula]] of [[Quebec]].

In the eastern United States, rumors and myths of the cougar never died, but this cat is slowly making its way from myth to reality, especially along the Appalachian Mountains from [[Virginia]] to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. In this region cougar sightings are steadily increasing, and a government bounty is offered in many places for confirmed sightings. One very compelling piece of evidence surfaced in June 1997, when a [[Kentucky]] man hit and killed a cougar kitten with his truck. DNA analysis proved that the animal was descended in part from wild North American cougars, and it showed no evidence of having been someone's escaped pet.<ref name=attacks/>

[[Image:MountainLion.jpg|thumb|left|Puma, photographed in the [[Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum]], Tucson, Arizona]]

The sightings are not limited to the mountains either. Locals as far east as the [[Atlantic Coastal Plain|Coastal Plain]] of [[North Carolina]] have reported sightings. In 1994 Charles R. "Buster" Humphreys Jr. claimed in his book, ''Panthers of the Coastal Plain'' to have recorded over 500 sightings of cougars. Half of these were coal black panthers. This species has never been officially recorded in North Carolina.<ref>http://farshores.org/abc_us04.htm</ref>

Due to [[urbanization]] in the [[urban-wildland interface]], cougar ranges increasingly overlap with human habitation, especially in areas with a large population of deer, its natural prey. In these cases, the cougar may occasionally prey on livestock and on [[pet]]s, such as dogs and cats. Cougar attacks on humans have increased since the late 1980s when cougar hunting was effectively banned in many states and the cougar populations began to climb dramatically. Even so, cougar attacks are still rare. Cougar hunting is still common in the [[United States]], and is permitted in every state from the Rocky Mountains to the [[Pacific Ocean]] with the exception of [[California]]. The cougar is typically hunted with dogs that chase the animal until it climbs a tree, whereupon the hunters shoot it. 

There are an estimated 4,000 to 6,000 cougars in [[California]] (circa 1990) and an estimated 4,500 to 5,000 in [[Colorado]].

==Attacks on humans==
[[Image:Puma warning.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Puma warning message]]
Attacks on humans are rare, but do occur, especially as humans encroach on wildlands and impact the availability of the cougar's traditional prey. There were around 100 cougar attacks on humans in the USA and Canada during the period from 1890 to January 2004, with 16 fatalities; California, which has the highest population density of areas with a significant cougar habitat, has had 64 attacks and 16 fatalities, most of which happened in the past 10 years. Attacks by cougars on humans and pets are associated with urban areas situated in the [[wildland urban intermix]] such as the [[Boulder, Colorado]] area, which have encouraged a traditional prey of the cougar, the [[mule deer]], to [[habituation|habituate]] to urban areas and the presence of people and pets. Cougars in such circumstances may come to lose their fear of both people and dogs and come to see them as prey.<ref>{{cite book | title = The Beast in the Garden | id = ISBN 0393058077}}</ref> "Given the opportunities available," notes wildlife biologist Kevin Hansen, "attacks on people are surprisingly rare events indeed, suggesting an overwhelming willingness on the part of the cougar to live and let live, at least where humans are concerned."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.watchtower.org/library/g/1998/4/22/article_01.htm | title = The Puma Everywhere and Nowhere}}</ref> 

As with many animals, a cougar may attack if cornered, if a fleeing human being stimulates its instinct to chase, or if a person mistakenly "plays dead." Exaggerating the threat to the animal through intense eye contact, loud but calm shouting, and any other action that makes a person appear larger and more menacing, may make the animal retreat; fighting back with sticks and rocks may also cause a cougar to disengage.<ref>Kobalenko, Jerry. ''Forest Cats of North America''. Buffalo, New York 14205: Firefly Books (U.S.) Inc, 1997. ISBN 1-55209-174-4</ref><ref>Sierra Club ''Wilderness Basics''. ISBN 0-89886-814-9</ref>

On [[January 8]], [[2004]] a cougar killed and partly ate a [[mountain biking|mountain biker]] in [[Whiting Ranch Wilderness Park]] in [[Orange County, California]]; what is assumed to be the same animal attacked another mountain biker in the park the same day, but was fought off by other [[mountain biking|bikers]]. A young male cougar was shot nearby by rangers later in the day.

The Cougar cannot be hunted in California except under very specific circumstances. This, as well as the extermination in California of the [[gray wolf]] and [[brown bear]], has allowed the Cougar to increase its numbers.  California law requires that wild animals who have attacked a human must be killed if they can be located.

==Ecological role==

Excepting human beings, no species preys upon mature cougars in the wild. The cat is not, however, the dominant predator throughout much of its range. In its northern range the cougar interacts with other large predators such as the [[brown bear]] and [[wolf]]. In the south, the [[jaguar]] and cougar are sympatric—related species sharing overlapping territory—and the jaguar is the larger of the two.

The Yellowstone ecosystem provides a fruitful microcosm to study inter-predator interaction in North America. Of the three large predators, the massive brown bear appears dominant, able to drive both wolves and cougars off their kills. One study found that bears (both brown and [[black bear|black]]) visited 24% of cougar kills in Yellowstone and [[Glacier National Park]]s, usurping 10% of carcasses.<ref>Assessment and Update Status Report on the Grizzly Bear (Ursus arctos) (2002). ''COSEWIC.'' Canadian Wildlife Service, [[Environment Canada]]. ([http://dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/Collection/CW69-14-166-2002E.pdf PDF]) Retrieved on: [[April 8]], [[2007]].</ref> 

Wolves and cougars compete more directly for prey, especially in winter. While individually more powerful than a wolf, a solitary cougar may be dominated by the pack structure of the canines: wolves can steal kills and occasionally kill the cat. One report describes a large pack of fourteen wolves killing a female cougar and her kittens; conversely, lone wolves are at a disadvantage, and have been reported killed by cougars.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A2158-2003May17&notFound=true |title=In Yellowstone, it's Carnivore Competition |last=Gugliotta |first=Guy |date=May 19, 2003 |publisher=[[Washington Post]] | accessdate=April 9, 2007}}</ref> Wolves more broadly affect cougar population dynamics and distribution by dominating territory and prey opportunities, and disrupting the feline's behaviour. Preliminary research in Yellowstone, for instance, has shown displacement of cougars by wolves.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greateryellowstonescience.org/topic/wolves/wolvesoverview.html |title=Overview: Gray Wolves |accessdate=2007-04-09 |publisher=Greater Yellowstone Learning Center}}</ref> One researcher in Oregon notes: "When there is a pack around, cougars are not comfortable around their kills or raising kittens...A lot of times a big cougar will kill a wolf, but the pack phenomenon changes the table."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oregonwild.org/press-room/press-clips/turf-wars-in-idaho-s-wilderness |title=Turf wars in Idaho's wilderness |last=Cockle |first=Richard |date=October 29, 2006 |publisher=[[The Oregonian]] | accessdate=April 9, 2007}}</ref> Both species, meanwhile, are capable of killing mid-sized predators such as [[bobcat]]s and [[coyote]]s and tend to suppress their numbers.<ref name=Yellowstone/>
