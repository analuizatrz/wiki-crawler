'''Brigadeiro''' is a simple [[Brazil]]ian [[chocolate]] [[fudge]] [[candy]] created in the [[1920]]'s, and named after [[Brigadeiro Eduardo Gomes]].

Eduardo Gomes was a [[Brazilian Air Force]] brigadier (thus the title "Brigadeiro", in Portuguese), who first gained notoriety for playing a part in quashing a [[communist]] [[coup]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Later he ran unsuccessfully for the presidency in [[1946]] and [[1950]], during a brief breeze of [[democracy]] that blew in Brazil after the [[Second World War]]. This was a time of shortage of traditional [[imports]] such as [[nut (fruit)|nuts]] and [[Europe]]an [[fruit]]s because of the war. But, at the same time, [[Nestlé]]™ was introducing its chocolate powder in the country.

Although [[Brazil]] is a major producer of [[cocoa]] beans, it is believed that the creation and success of the candy was a combination of opportunities: the [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] Nestlé™, which introduced chocolate powder; the creators who named it after a famous politician, the need to find a replacement to imported sweets; and its ease of manufacture.

There are rumors that claim that the invention of the brigadeiro was also a joke made after Eduardo Gomes, since he had lost one of his [[testicle]]s in a shooting during an [[urban area|urban]] conflict, and, unlike many popular Brazilian candies, brigadeiros have no [[egg (food)|eggs]] in their recipe and, in Portuguese, egg is a slang for testicles.<br/>
Brigadeiro, [[beijinho]] and [[cajuzinho]], are the three most common birthday parties candies.

There are two ways to serve brigadeiro. The traditional method is to roll the candy into balls which are then covered
in sprinkles. The second method is to leave the candy slightly more fluid and to eat it with a spoon. 
== Recipe ==
* 1 can of sweet [[condensed milk]]
* 3 tablespoons of cocoa powder
* 1 tablespoon butter or margarine
* Chocolate sprinkles (optional)

'''On the stove:'''
Put all the ingredients (except for the sprinkles) in a pan and mix them well. Put it on the stove, on medium-low heat. Stir continuously. If you want a creamy brigadeiro, cook until desired thickness is reached. For a birthday party, cook it until it gets so thick that you can see the bottom of the pan while stirring it.

'''In the microwave:'''
Put all the ingredients in a large bowl and mix them well. Place it in the microwave on high heat for 3 minutes. Stir it and put it on high heat for an additional 3 minutes. When ready stir it until the bubbles are gone and you will have creamy brigadeiro. If you want to roll it for a party, microwave for an additional 3 minutes on high heat. 
NOTE: The time can vary depending on your microwave.

'''To roll it:'''
If you want a birthday brigadeiro, make the cream very thick. Wait until the cream is cold. Roll it into small ball shapes and cover them with chocolate sprinkles. Serve in small cupcake holders.

'''Another option:'''
Some people make the creamy version for parties too. If you like it, serve it in very small glasses or dixie cups, topped with sprinkles.
