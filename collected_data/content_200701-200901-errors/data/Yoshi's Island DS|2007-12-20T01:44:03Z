== Gameplay ==
[[Image:YoshisIslandDSscreen.jpg|thumb|150px|left|A screenshot showing ''Yoshi's Island DS''<nowiki>'</nowiki>'s distinctive graphical style. The [[Nintendo DS]]'s two screens function as one tall screen.]]
''Yoshi's Island DS''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s gameplay is fundamentally the same as the previous game. The player guides various different coloured [[Yoshi]]s through [[Side-scrolling video game|side scrolling]] stages<ref name="gamepro">{{cite web|date=[[2006-11-14]]| title=Review: Yoshi's Island DS | url=http://www.gamepro.com/nintendo/ds/games/reviews/86048.shtml | work=[http://www.gamepro.com GamePro] | accessdate=25 November | accessyear=2006}}</ref> in "get from A to B" fashion. To this end, Yoshi is able to jump and hover for a short time, eat enemies and turn them into eggs (which can be used for things like hitting switches and defeating distant enemies) and pound the ground (to, say, smash crates).<ref name=gamespot /> Some stages offer Yoshi the ability to morph into vehicles for a short time.<ref name="gamepro" /> ''DS'', like the original ''Yoshi's Island'', differs from many platforming games in that Yoshi does not have a [[life bar]]; when Yoshi is hit, the baby he is carrying falls off his back and Yoshi must retrieve him/her before a timer runs out.<ref name= "gamespot" />

''DS'' differs from the previous game in that five babies are available for Yoshi to carry, each bestowing a different ability. Baby Mario allows Yoshi to dash and makes special 'M' blocks appear. He can also grab Super Stars to become Super Baby Mario. Baby Peach allows Yoshi to float and fly on wind currents, Baby DK can grab and swing on vines and ropes, Baby Wario uses his magnet to attract metal objects and Baby Bowser spits fireballs.<ref name="ign">{{cite web|first=Craig|last=Harris| date=[[2006-11-13]] | title=Yoshi's Island DS Review | url=http://uk.ds.ign.com/articles/745/745698p1.html | publisher=IGN UK | accessdate=25 November | accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref name="gamespot" /> The need to switch babies at key points adds a [[Puzzle game|puzzle]] element to the game.<ref name="ign" />

The [[Nintendo DS]]'s two screens act as one tall screen.<ref name="gamepro" /> However, in practice, this essentially just gives the player a better view of the surroundings and, save for one [[Boss (video games)|boss]] battle, only provides the benefit of being able to see more(above) and, when you're on the top screen, below.<ref name="gamespot" /> The game does not make use of the bottom screen's touch sensitivity for basic gameplay, though it is an option for selecting levels and in some mini-games.<ref name="gamespot" /> Each of ''DS''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s five worlds has two bosses, each with a weakness that must be identified and exploited. Most of the time, these are simply giant-sized versions of normal enemies, though some are more inventive.<ref name="ign" />

Flowers and coins, as well as stars, are scattered about the game's stages. These are totalled at the end of each stage and a score is given depending how many of each were collected<ref name="gamespot" /> (a maximum of 30 stars, 20 red coins and 5 flowers). Perfect scores are required to unlock one of the two sets of secret levels<ref name="gamespot" /> (the other set being unlocked upon completing the game). Special character coins are also introduced. Missing from the game are the power-ups of sorts, like the ability to spit seeds by eating watermelons, which were present in the original.<ref name="ign" />

Keys scattered throughout the stages unlock minigames which are playable both mid-level and from the main menu.<ref name="gamepro" /><ref name="gamespot" />

== Plot ==

As in [[Yoshi's Island]], Baby Mario and the Yoshi clan must recapture the endangered Baby Luigi, who was snatched by [[Bowser]]'s minion, Kamek. However, this time the Yoshis have the combined assistance of both Baby Peach and Baby DK &ndash; who escaped the botched capture by the [[Mario series enemies#Magikoopa|Magikoopa]]. They become acquainted with Baby Wario and Baby Bowser, who both join, offering their specialised abilities so that the group may proceed.<ref name="gamespot" /> Baby Wario's insatiable lust for treasure leads him to abandon his duties whilst Baby Bowser betrays the group upon arrival of Bowser's castle. Despite this, the babies and Yoshis prevail, in both defeating Bowser&mdash;who had traveled to the past to capture the "Star Babies"&mdash;and retrieving Baby Luigi.

== Visuals, audio and development ==
''DS'' was announced at E3 2006 under the name ''Yoshi's Island 2'',<ref name="igne3" /> originally featuring only baby versions of Mario, Peach, and DK.<ref name="igne3" /> The developer, Artoon, has made one other Yoshi game: [[Yoshi's Universal Gravitation|Yoshi Topsy-Turvy]] for the GBA. Topsy-Turvy veered away from the "Nintendo" design, but for ''DS'' Artoon stuck close to the original concept.<ref name="ign" />

The game retains the "classic" pastel/crayon visuals from its predecessor.<ref name="gamepro" /> Small changes are noticeable -  water animation is better, the black outlines around objects aren't as thick and the backgrounds are less cluttered<ref name="gamespot" /> - but the visuals are still "tightly centered" on those of the Super NES game.<ref name="ign" /> Most of the music in ''DS'', as is the case in Yoshi's Story, centers around a single basic melody.

== Reception and sales==
''Yoshi's Island DS''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s reception was positive, being given high scores by some of the most prominent gaming critics. These include gaming websites [[IGN]] and [[GameSpot]], who gave it 8/10 and 9.1/10 respectively.<ref name="ign" /><ref name="gamespot"/> [[GameSpot]]'s review commented that the developers have "produced a sequel that seems fresh and new while remaining every bit as awesome as the original".<ref name="gamespot" /> Multimedia website IGN called it "a solid recreation of the Yoshi's Island elements in a two-screen-high format,"<ref name="ign" /> and [[GamePro]] in their review said that "it's fun and light-hearted play".<ref name="gamepro" />
Reviewers were particularly pleased with how the core gameplay elements are the same as in the previous game. GamePro hails it as having "the classical 2D side-scrolling action and colorful pastel artwork that brought Nintendo to prominence",<ref name="gamepro" /> while IGN, although impressed with the game in general, wonders whether the developers "stuck too close to the established design in this new game", because having played the previous game "ruins a lot of the surprises".<ref name="ign" />

One problem critics identified is the [[Blind spot (vision)|blind spot]] created by the gap between the Nintendo DS's two screens. IGN accepts that this blind spot is necessary for aiming eggs properly but still describe it as "bothersome".<ref name="ign" /> [[GameSpy]]'s reviewer calls it "a pain" and expresses frustration at being hit by an enemy hiding in this gap.<ref name="gamespy">{{cite web|last = TheoBald|first = Phil | date=[[2006-11-14]] | title=Yoshi's Island DS Review | url=http://ds.gamespy.com/nintendo-ds/yoshis-island-ds/746011p1.html |publisher = GameSpy | accessdate=26 November | accessyear=2006}}</ref> On the whole, reviewers were pleased with the way the extra babies have been implemented,<ref name="gamespot" /> but IGN felt that Baby Wario was "a last minute addition that wasn't tested properly".<ref name="ign" /> They call his magnet "wonky", and says it "[misses] items that are right next to him".<ref name="ign" />

''Yoshi's Island DS'' was given GameSpot's "Editor's Choice" rating,<ref name="gamespot" /> and reached the final round for "Best Nintendo DS game".<ref name="gamespotbestworst2006"> {{cite web| year=2006 | title=Best Nintendo DS game | url=http://www.gamespot.com/special_features/bestof2006/platform/index.html?page=3&tag=topslot;title;1&om_act=convert&click=topslot | publisher=GameSpot | accessdate=10 January | accessyear=2007}}</ref> The game sold more than 300,000 copies in its first week of release in Japan.<ref name=N-Europe>{{cite web| date=[[2007-03-19]] | title=Charts: Latest Japanese Software & Hardware Sales | url=http://www.n-europe.com/news.php?nid=10262 | work=[http://www.n-europe.com/ N-Europe] | accessdate=19 March | accessyear=2007}}</ref> As of [[July 25]], [[2007]], ''Yoshi's Island DS'' has sold 2.47 million copies worldwide.<ref name="nintendo-Q108">{{cite web | url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/807/807852p1.html | title=Nintendo Sales Update |last =Casamassina
