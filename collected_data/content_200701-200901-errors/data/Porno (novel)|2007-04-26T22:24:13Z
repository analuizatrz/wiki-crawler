'''''Porno''''' is a [[novel]] by [[Scotland|Scottish]] writer [[Irvine Welsh]], and is the [[sequel]] to ''[[Trainspotting (novel)|Trainspotting]]''.
The book describes the characters of [[Trainspotting (novel)|Trainspotting]] nine years after the events of the earlier book, as their paths cross again in, this time the pornography business being the backdrop rather than heroin use. A number of characters from ''[[Glue (novel)|Glue]]'' make an appearance as well.

This sequel picks up ideas of the film adaptation of [[Trainspotting (film)|''Trainspotting'']]. One example is the fact that "Spud" has received his share of the drug money, which is shown in the film, but only alluded to in the book.

==Plot summary==
{{spoiler}}
The novel is divided into 3 sections, each of which comprises [[chapter]]s with different [[narrator]]s. Unlike ''Trainspotting'' which had more narrational diversity, ''Porno'' is reduced to just 5 narrators: Sick Boy, Renton, Spud, Begbie and Nikki. Another difference from the format of ''Trainspotting'' is that each [[fictional character|character]] has a defined chapter heading : Sick Boy = [[Scam]] # 18,732(-18,753); Renton = Whores of Amsterdam Pt 1(-12); Spud = Title; Begbie = TITLE; Nikki = ". . . quote from chapter . . .". 

Each narrator is associated with a distinctive prose style.  Renton, Sick Boy, and Nikki's chapters are written almost entirely in "standard" English while Begbie and Spud's chapters are in [[Scots language|Scots]].  For example, in Chapter 25, Spud narrates, "So ah'm downcast when ah git intae the library, thinkin tae masel" ("So I'm downcast when I get into the library thinking to myself"). Sick Boy's returning grandiose nature is featured in imagined interviews with John Gibson of the ''Evening News'' and [[Alex McLeish]]. 

===Section 1: Stag===
In Leith, Sick Boy comes into ownership of his aunt's [[pub]], a welcome change from the [[Cocaine#Crack cocaine|crack]] scene he has been in, and decides that he will focus all his energy into making the bar successful and classier. Nikki is attending university while also performing moderate prostitution at a massage parlour ([[handjob]]s only). Rab introduces Nikki to Terry and his underground/homemade porn operation: the scene interests Nikki, and Nikki interests Terry. Spud is regularly attending group sessions for help in kicking his heroin habit but his relationship with his wife, Alison, is strained; Spud contemplates [[suicide]] paired with [[life insurance]] as a means of ensuring a brighter future for his wife and his son, Andy. While working at his bar, Sick Boy meets up with Terry and they agree that the upstairs of the bar would make a suitable venue for shooting some scenes. 

Meanwhile in [[Amsterdam]], Renton is living luxuriously as the co-owner of a [[nightclub]]. On this particular night, the [[DJ]] is from his hometown of Leith and the two nod in recognition as Mark leaves the club. Back at Sick Boy's pub, he and his new associates begin the ambitious planning of a professional, legitimate film. Nikki enthusiastically signs onto the project, but gets sick before being able to perform and is shuttled home. The first section concludes with "OOTSIDE", a chapter noting the release into society of Francis Begbie.

===Section 2: Porno===
While in prison Begbie had been periodically receiving packages of [[gay]] pornography sent anonymously (by Sick Boy) and places finding the culprit on his agenda along with reintegrating into his old criminal scene. While accompanying his old friend Larry on a debt collection errand he meets Kate, a woman currently bruised from an instance of [[domestic violence]], and decides to take her out. At his pub, Sick Boy and Spud are in the course of winding each other up in front of Alison; the discussion turns to Renton ripping them off and Spud reveals that he wasn't ripped off, since he had eventually received his share in full, much to Sick Boy's displeasure. Then when Sick Boy points out that he has amounted to nothing, Spud unveils his recent ambition: to write his own book on the history of Leith. Sick Boy is unimpressed and the couple depart. As Sick Boy is reflecting on Alison's deteriorating loveliness "''He'' comes in". Sick Boy offers Begbie a beer and the two converse, while Sick Boy simultaneously considers the duplicitous trait of opportunity and [[threat]] accompanying Begbie's release. Soon after, Terry and others enter the bar and begin discussing  their upcoming trip to Amsterdam as a bachelor celebration for Rab; among them is Carl, a DJ who just recently returned from a visit to "the Dam". Initially, Sick Boy decides not to accompany them, but quickly changes his mind when Carl innocently mentions he worked in a club called Luxury, owned by an old friend of his, Renton.

===Section 3: Exhibition===

==Characters in "Porno"==
*Simon "Sick Boy" David Williamson - Marred by a string of failed business ventures, decides to make a porn film.  A heavy [[cocaine]] user. Still bitter about being ripped off by Renton in the previous novel. In the years since ''Trainspotting'' he had a son with a woman who is now his ex-wife. He has also lost some of the charm and physical attractiveness he previously possessed.

*Mark "Rents" Renton - Kicked heroin and owns a successful nightclub in Amsterdam. Agrees to finance Sick Boy's porn film in exchange for a share of the profits, despite a mutual lack of trust and amiability. Has got into shape and learned martial arts in anticipation and fear of an eventual meeting with Begbie.

*Nikki Fuller-Smith - 25-year old university student and film studies major who moonlights performing minor sexual favours at a sauna/massage parlour.  Has body image problems (she occasionally vomits after meals) and is attracted to Sick Boy.  She decides to help Sick Boy with his film by starring in it. 

*Daniel "Spud" Murphy - Still on drugs but trying to kick them.  The only one compensated for his role in the drug deal at the end of ''Trainspotting'', and holds no ill will against Renton as a result. Married with a son, Andy, but is plagued by marital and self-esteem problems. 

*Francis "Franco" Begbie - Spent three years in prison for manslaughter. The crime was actually a murder, but he managed to stab himself and plant false evidence to make it seem like manslaughter. Harbours a lot of resentment towards Renton for ripping him off in the last novel and blames him for the murder he committed. Still as violent and psychopathic as ever, now even more [[Paranoia|paranoid]] due to heavy cocaine use. The fact that Sick Boy anonymously sends gay porn to his prison cell doesn't help this paranoia.

*Lauren - Nikki's best friend and flatmate, a feminist, who tries to dissuade Nikki from being in a porn film. She is generally regarded as a bore and/or motherly figure.

*Terry "Juice" Lawson- Amateur porn star that Sick Boy employs to be in his film. A main character in ''Glue''.

*Rab - Friend of Nikki and Lauren also younger brother of "Business Birrell" from Glue, who introduces them to the underground porn scene. Engaged with a child on the way.

*Dianne - Another flatmate of Nikki's.  Had a relationship with Renton during ''Trainspotting'' while she was underaged. Currently studying for a [[psychology]] degree, with particular attention to sexual psychology.
