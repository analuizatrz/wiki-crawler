'''''In the Groove''''' (abbreviated '''''ITG''''') is the first [[Video game|game]] in the ''[[In the Groove (series)|In the Groove]]'' franchise, published and developed by [[Roxor Games]], and first released in [[video arcade]]s around [[August 30]], [[2004]].

==Gameplay==
{{seealso|Dance Dance Revolution#Common Gameplay Elements}}
{{main|In the Groove (series)#Common Gameplay Elements}}
''In the Groove'' utilizes similar mechanics to [[Konami|Konami's]] ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]'' series, The core gameplay involves the player moving his or her feet to a set pattern, stepping in time to the general rhythm or beat of a song. During normal gameplay, arrows scroll upwards from the bottom of the screen and pass over flashing stationary arrows (referred to as the "guide arrows" or "receptors"). When the scrolling arrows overlap the stationary ones, the player must step on the corresponding arrows on the dance platform. Longer arrows referred to as "holds" must be held down for their entire length for them to count. Successfully hitting the arrows in time with the music fills the life bar, while failure to do so drains it. If the life bar is fully depleted during gameplay, the player fails the song, usually resulting in a game over. Otherwise, the player is taken to the Results Screen, which rates the player's performance with a letter grade and a percentage score, among other statistics. The player may then be given a chance to play again, depending on the settings of the particular machine (the limit is usually 3-5 songs per game).

Stepcharts on ''In the Groove'' can sometimes contain 3 or 4 arrow combinations (usually hit with the assistance of hands). Stepcharts can also contain Mines. If a player is on an arrow when a mine passes through the step zone for that arrow, it will explode and health will be lost.

==Modes of Play==

In The Groove offers various modes of play.

'''Dance Mode''' is the default mode of play.  In this mode, a player chooses a number of individual songs to play (the default is three).  After the songs are played, the game is over.

'''Marathon Mode''' is an extended mode of play.  In this mode, a player chooses a predefined configuration of songs that may also have a predefined script of ''modifiers'' whose purpose is to make the song more challenging.  Marathon courses typically have four songs, although some have five songs.

'''Battle Mode''' is a specialized "versus" mode of play.  Two players (or one player against the computer) play three individual songs of the same difficulty.  During the song, successfully executed steps fill up a player's "power bar".  When the power bar completely fills, a modifier is applied to the opposing player's side.

==Song list==
This list covers the 75 songs available in the arcade and home versions of In the Groove.  All the songs are playable in the sequel game, ''[[In the Groove 2]]''. For songs exclusive to In the Groove 2, see the [[In the Groove 2#Song list|ITG2 song list]].

The difficulties are abbreviated to conserve table space:
:N = Novice
:E = Easy
:M = Medium
:H = Hard
:X = Expert

Note the numbers given for each difficulty level are similar to DDR's 1-10 "footers," except ITG removed the footer label and added 3 additional difficulties, far surpassing the hardest 10-footers in DDR. Thus a 10 in ITG is comparable to a 10-footer in DDR. If one actually counts the number of boxes showing the difficulty, one will notice there are only 12 boxes. The 13s go far and beyond the realm of reality for most people. Only one 13 exists in In the Groove 1, while two make their debut in the sequel.

Songs that need to be unlocked in the arcade version are highlighted in red.  Songs that are from In the Groove 2 are highlighted in green.  These also need to be unlocked.

The Novice steps are only available in the home version, as well as in the sequel.  In addition, there is an asterisk beside the Single Expert step routines for "Why Me."  These are also only available in the sequel.  The Double Expert steps are not on any current release of In the Groove 1, but they are on the sequel.  It is marked with a karat to emphasize this.

There is one song that is in the arcade version that cannot be played in normal mode. "Liquid Moon" exists only in the ''Energy'' Marathon course.  It is fully playable in the home version and the sequel.  It is highlighted as a home version song.

==Lawsuit==

[[Konami]] filed a [[lawsuit]] against [[Roxor Games]] on an infringement of various rights on [[May 9]], [[2005]].  Additionally, they amended their complaint on [[July 1]], [[2005]], to include the dance game "MC GROOVZ danceCRAZE" (a game produced by [[Mad Catz]] to accompany their 3rd party dance mat). [[Konami]] primarily claims that Roxor has infringed their dancing game patent rights, but also goes on to claim that the refitting of arcade cabinets "has been done in an infringing and unfair way". ITG fans were quick to criticise the lawsuit, pointing out that [[Konami]]'s Japanese arcade games are illegal in the United States.   

On [[July 10]], [[2005]], however, Konami amended its complaint to include the In The Groove PS2 game and its publisher [[RedOctane]].  On [[July 25]], [[2005]], Roxor Games filed a [[counterclaim]] against Konami. In the counterclaim, Roxor denies the claims in Konami's complaint, stating that 'In The Groove' does not violate patent law and that claiming that Konami has engaged in unfair competition.

However, the lawsuit ultimately ended in a settlement.  On [[October 18]], [[2006]], Roxor announced that Konami had acquired the intellectual property rights to the In the Groove series as part of the settlement to this litigation.<ref name="Acquisition">[http://www.inthegroove.com/page/Press_Release Konami acquires In the Groove]</ref>
