The '''Appalachian School of Law''' (ASL) is a fully-accredited private [[law school]] in [[Grundy, Virginia]], a small town near the convergence of [[Virginia]], [[Kentucky]], and [[West Virginia]]. The school offers a three-year [[Juris Doctor]] degree, and enrolls approximately 380 full-time students from numerous states and several foreign countries. The school also has 482 alumni and 50 staff. The law school was founded in 1994 with a deep commitment to community service and leadership, and it admitted its first class of students in August 1997.

==History==
[[Image:AtriumASL.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Atrium at ASL, circa 2002.]]
===The Beginning===
ASL traces its roots back to [[1993]] when [[Norton, Virginia]] lawyer Joe Wolfe came up with the idea to create a law school in Central [[Appalachia]].  His idea was well received by local business leaders and a steering committee was founded in [[1994]] and grew to eighty members.  The committee gained permission of the [[Virginia General Assembly]] to start a law school in [[1995]] and continued to secure endorsements from local civic associations and industrial development authorities.  [[Buchanan County, Virginia]] approached the committee in [[1996]] and offered the grounds and buildings of the former Grundy Elementary and Intermediate Schools to which the steering committee accepted. The State Council of Higher Education in Virginia granted the school the ability to enroll students studying for the [[Juris Doctor]] Degree in [[1997]].  The charter class of 71 students first attended classes on [[August 12]], [[1997]].<ref name="ASL Course Catalog">{{cite web

===Accreditation===
Appalachian School of Law was granted full accreditation by the [[American Bar Association]] on [[June 12]], [[2006]]. The school had been provisionally accredited by the ABA since February 2001. Students who complete their course of legal study at this approved law school are eligible to take the bar examination in all 50 states and the [[District of Columbia]]. Prior to February [[2001]], graduates of the school were allowed to sit for the bar examination in [[Virginia]] and [[West Virginia]].<ref name="ASL Full Accreditation">{{cite web

===January 2002 Campus Shooting===
{{main|Appalachian School of Law shooting}}
On [[January 16]], [[2002]], ASL Dean Anthony Sutin, Professor Thomas Blackwell, and 1L student Angela Dales were shot and killed by disgruntled student Peter Odighizuwa, 43, of [[Nigeria]]. At trial, Odighizuwa was found mentally competent, plead guilty to the murders to avoid the [[death penalty]], and was sentenced to multiple life terms in prison.

===Community Impact===
[[Buchanan County, Virginia|Buchanan County]] brought ASL to [[Grundy, Virginia|Grundy]] in order to revitalize a town that had been in a steady economic decline since the town's Flood of 1977. ASL has brought a positive economic impact on its home town, [[Grundy, Virginia|Grundy]], including spurring additional building of rental homes and the opening of additional businesses in the area. ASL's success spurred the conception and implementation of the [[University of Appalachia College of Pharmacy]] from 2003 to the date the doors opened in 2005.<ref name="Open House">{{cite web

==Campus==
[[Image:ASLlibrary.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Law Library, 2002.]]The campus of ASL currently consists of three buildings, the main academic building, the Student Organization House, and the law library. A fourth building, Booth Hall, is under construction.
===Main Academic Building=== 
The main academic building was created from the town's former high school and gymnasium complex; these buildings were joined and extensively remodeled and expanded as part of an award-winning architectural project.  The main building contains an appellate courtroom, a trial courtroom, five classrooms, student mailroom, the Lion's Lounge, and offices.

===Law Library=== 
The two-story law library is adjacent to the main building. The building has 24,780 square feet and has facilities for seminar classes and group study rooms. The library contains over 196,000 volumes.<ref name="ASL Library">{{cite web

===Student Organization House===
This building, located across Slate Creek from the main campus, houses offices for student organizations including the Student Bar Association, Moot Court, and the Law Journal.  A privately owned coffee shop operates out of this building during the school year.

===Booth Hall===
A fourth campus building, Booth Hall, is now under construction. Booth Hall will be situated behind and to the rear of the main academic building and law library. The building will have 58,000 square feet of space on three floors. Thirty three parking spaces will be situated on the first floor.  Additional classrooms, including one that seats 150 students, student lounges, and a conference room will be included in the new building. The building is estimated to be completed in 2008 and will house the school's Business Office and President's Office.  The building will also house facilities for [[Southwest Virginia Community College]], who will share classroom space with ASL.<ref name="New Building Planned">{{cite web

==Academic Program==
[[Image:ASLPhoto2005.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Photo of academic building at the Appalachian School of Law in 2005.]]Students at Appalachian complete the traditional law school curriculum as required by the [[American Bar Association]] (ABA); however, the school distinguishes itself from almost all of the other 192 ABA accredited law schools in the country, as its students are required to volunteer 25 hours each semester on community service projects, ranging from dispute resolution training to humane society management. Only 11 other law schools have similar mandatory programs.

===First Year Curriculum===
First year students cover the following legal foundation courses: [[Torts]] (4 credits), [[Contracts]] (6 credits), [[Property]] (6 credits), [[Civil Procedure]] (5 credits), [[Criminal Law]] (3 credits) and [[Legal Process]] (6 credits).  Legal Process teaches students legal research and writing. First-year students also take an orientation course to the community service program in the first semester and an additional legal research course in the second semester. First-year students may not take any electives.<ref name="ASL Curriculum">{{cite web

====Externship Program====
Additionally, all first-year students are required to complete a 200-hour unpaid externship over the summer before their second-year. This requirement is usually met by students working as judicial clerks, interns in prosecutor and defense offices, governmental agencies, and private practices. The school provides assistance in locating and obtaining these positions.<ref name="Externship">{{cite web

====Alternative Dispute Resolution====
ASL is also distinguished by its requirement that all second-year students complete a mandatory [[Alternative Dispute Resolution]] (ADR) class.  The school has also held ADR training in local schools; this program drew national attention, particularly from former U.S. [[Attorney General]] [[Janet Reno]], who has publicly congratulated the school on this effort.
<p>Students also have the option of taking additional courses in their second and third years to earn certification for mediation under the "Lawyer as a Problem Solver" Certificate Program. Students must complete basic law school procedure courses, two ADR focused courses, and an additional problem solving skills course.<ref name=" ASL Graduate Begins Prestigious Masters of Law Program">{{cite web

The Senate consists of three elected senators for the first year, second year, and third year classes.  The Executive Branch consists of the Student Body President, Vice President, Secretary, and Treasurer, plus any committees that the President appoints to assist in his or her endeavors.  The Honor Court consists of five elected judges, one for the first year class and two per upper class.<ref name="ASL Student Bar Association">{{cite web
