The '''Sukhoi Su-25''' ([[NATO reporting name]] "'''Frogfoot'''") is a battlefield [[attack aircraft|attack]], [[close air support]], and [[anti-tank]] aircraft designed by the [[Soviet Union]]. It remains in service with [[Russia]] and various other [[CIS]] states and export customers.

The aircraft was designed by [[Sukhoi]] and its developement begun in January 1972. The Su-25 prototype, designated as "T8-1", had its maiden flight on 22nd February 1975, being flyed by [[Vladimir Ilyushin]]. After all the testing phases were completed, the Su-25 went in series production in 1979, at Tbilisi, in the [[Georgian SSR|Soviet Republic of Georgia]].

In the late-1980s and 1990s, new modernized and dedicated for different tasks Su-25 variants appeared, the most significant ones being the Su-25UB (trainer), Su-25BM (target-towing) and Su-25T (antitank). Also, a Su-25KM prototype was developed by [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] in cooperation with Israeli [[Elbit Systems]] company in 2001, thus this variant did not achieved much succes.

The [[Russian Air Force]] is currently the biggest operator of the Su-25, and it has plans to upgrade its fleet to Su-25SM variant. However, this is a slow process due to funds shortage, only 7 aircraft being modernized until early-2007.

==Development==
The Su-25 was designed by [[Sukhoi]] as a result of studies in the late 1960s on an aircraft to fill the ground attack role. It is heavily armed, with a [[Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-30-2]] 30mm cannon and various air-to-ground munitions; it can carry more than 4,000 kg (8,818 lb) of weaponry in the ground-attack role. It is comparable to the [[A-10 Thunderbolt II]], although it more closely resembles the [[Northrop YA-9]], which lost the [[United States Air Force|USAF]] A-X competition to the A-10. (The same requirement led to the development of [[fighter bomber]] versions of the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23|MiG-23 'Flogger']], culminating in the definitive [[Mikoyan MiG-27|MiG-27 'Flogger']], although those aircraft share nothing with the Su-25 in design.)

The first prototype, with the bureau designation '''T-8-1''', made its first flight on [[22 February]], [[1975 in aviation|1975]]. Development problems delayed its service entry until April [[1981 in aviation|1981]]. Early examples that were observed by the west were spotted at the Zhukovsky flight test centre near the town of [[Ramenskoye]], resulting in the temporary codename of '''Ram-J.''' The Ram-J was initially believed to have overwing mounted [[turbojets]] and a [[tailplane]] mounted midway up the vertical stabilizer, unlike the actual aircraft.

The Su-25, which is called ''Grach'' ([[rook (bird)|rook]]) in [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] service, was heavily used by the [[Soviet Union]] during its operations in [[Afghanistan]] in the 1980s. 22 Su-25 were lost in this conflict.

==Variants==
===Su-25 (early version)=== 
During the testing phase of the first two prototypes, T8-1 and T8-2, the [[Sukhoi Design Bureau]]'s management had started to look around for a plant where series production of the Su-25 could be undertaken. The period coincided with burgeoning production of military aircraft for the Soviet Union, and there was little spare capacity anywhere in the USSR. Clearly all this put the company in a very difficult position, and production of the Su-25 was thus placed in serious jeopardy by the lack of a suitable manufacturing plant. The only remaining possibility was Factory No. 31, at Tbilisi, in the [[Georgian SSR|Soviet Republic of Georgia]], the major manufacturing base for the [[MiG-21|MiG-21UM]] "''Mongol-B''" trainer.<ref>Yefim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.43-44</ref> The Soviet Ministry of Aircraft Production authorised the manufacture of the Su-25 at Tbilisi, and the production commenced in 1978. Between 1978 and 1989, 582 single-seat Su-25s were produced in Georgia (without counting the Su-25K).<ref name="Variants">Yefim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.45-46</ref>

During the course of its operational service and after a number of accidents that were caused by systems failures on the Su-25, attributed to salvo firing of weapons, the use of its main armament, the 240mm [[S-24]] missile, was prohibited. Its place as the main heavy weapon was taken by the [[FAB-500]] 500kg general-purpose high-explosive bomb.<ref name="Variants" />

====Su-25K==== 
The Su-25 was used as the basis for a commercial export variant, known as the Su-25K ('''''K'''omercheskiy''), and also built at Factory 31 in Tbilisi, Georgia. The aircraft differed from the Soviet Air Force version in certain minor details concerning internal equipment. A total of 180 Su-25K aircraft were built at Tbilisi between 1984 and 1989.<ref name="Variants" />

===Su-25UB===
[[Image:Su-25UB.jpg|thumb|right|A freshly painted Su-25UB preparing to take-off.]]
The Su-25UB [[trainer]] ('''''U'''chebno-'''B'''oyevoy'') was preliminary drawn up in 1977, under the T-8UB designation. The first prototype, called "T-8UB-1" was rolled out in July 1985, and its maiden flight was carried out at the [[Ulan-Ude]] factory airfield on 12 August.<ref name="Variants"/> The Su-25UB was intended for training and check flights of pilots onthe squadrons and teaching cadets the techniques of aircraft handling in Soviet Air Force flying schools. The performance of the Su-25UB did not differ substantially from that of the single-seater. The navigation-attack, sighting devices and weapons -control system of the two-seater enabled it to be used for both routine training and weapons-training missions.<ref>Yefim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.50-51</ref> By the end of 1986 a total of 25 Su-25UBs had been produced at Ulan-Ude, although the twin-seater had been built at a time when the aircraft had not yet completed its State trials and had not been officially cleared for service with the Soviet Air Force.<ref>Yefim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.54</ref>

====Su-25UBK====
From 1986 to 1989, in parallel with the construction of the main Su-25UB combat training variant, the Ulan-Ude plant was also producing the so-called "commercial" Su-25UBK, which was intended for export to the countries who already bought the Su-25K. The Su-25UBK differed  from the Su-25UB only in minor details, in much the same way as the export Su-25K differed from the Soviet Air Force Su-25.<ref>Yefim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.56</ref>

====Su-25UTG====
[[Image:Su-25UTG.jpg|thumb|right|Su-25UTG on the [[Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov]].]]
The Su-25UTG ('''''U'''chebno-'''T'''renirovochnyy s '''G'''akom'') is based on the Su-25UB combat trainer and was designed specifically to train pilots in the techniques of taking-off from, and landing on, a land-based simulated carrier deck complex, with a sloping ski-jump section and arrester wires. The first Su-25UTG flew in September [[1988 in aviation|1988]], and about ten were produced.<ref>Yefim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.59</ref> About half remained in Russian service after 1991, used with Russia's sole [[aircraft carrier]], [[Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov|''Admiral Kuznetsov'']]. Such a small number of aircraft was insufficient to serve the training needs of Russia's carrier air group, so an additional batch of around then Su-25UBs were converted into Su-25UTGs, these aircraft also being known by the alternative designation Su-25UBP ('''''U'''chebno-'''B'''oyevoy '''P'''alubny'') - the adjective "palubnyy" meaning "deck", indicated that these aircraft had a naval function.<ref>Yefim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.60-68</ref> About 10 aircraft are currently operational in the [[Russian Navy]], being part of the 279th Naval Aviation Regiment.<ref>[http://www.warfare.ru/?linkid=1611&catid=256 Russian Military Analysis on Su-25], warfare.ru, accesed 18th June 2007</ref>

===Su-25BM===
The Su-25BM ('''''B'''uksirovshchik '''M'''isheney'') is a target-towing variant of the Su-25 and its development begun in 1986. The prototype, designated as "T-8BM1", succesfully first flew on 22nd March 1990, at Tbilisi. After succesfull completion of the test phase, the aircraft, which was given the service designation "Su-25BM", was put into series production at Tbilisi.<ref name="Su-25BM">Yefim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.69-71 </ref>

The Su-25BM target-tower was designed to provide towed target facilities for training [[Russian Ground Forces|ground forces]] and naval personnel equipped with ground-to-air or naval surface-to-air missiles. It is powered by [[R-195]] engine and equipped with RSDN-10 long-range [[navigation system]], which is analoguos in operation to the Western [[LORAN]] equipment.<ref name="Su-25BM" />

===Su-25T===
The Su-25T ('''''T'''ankovy'') is an dedicated anti-tank version of the Su-25, which have been tested with notable succes in real combat missions in Chechnya. Possesing the best features and qualities of the original Su-25, the Su-25T is a true all-weather attack aircraft and capable of night operations. The Su-25T can employ the full arsenal of weapons of the standard Su-25, as well as the [[KAB-500|KAB-500Kr]] [[TV]]-guided bomb and the semi-active [[laser-guided]] Kh-25ML. The later Su-25TM (Su-39), was developed with an improved nav/attack system, better survivability, and capability of carrying new precision-guided weapons. The Russian Air Force received only a small number of each version. However, the improved systems from these aircraft have been utilised in the '''Su-25SM''', an upgrade for series produced Su-25s for the Russian Air Force, resulting in superior survivability and combat capability.<ref>Yefim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.89</ref>

===Su-25KM===
The SU-25KM, is a somewhat unexpected Su-25 upgrade programme that was announced in early-2001, involving a partnership between the original manufacturer, Tbilisi Aerospace Manufacturing in Georgia, and [[Elbit Systems]] of Israel. Using a standard Su-25 airframe, the result of this colaboration has been named "''Scorpion''" and the aircraft's designation has been changed to Su-25KM ('''''K'''ommercheskiy '''M'''odernizirovannyy''). The aircraft made its maiden flight on 18 April 2001 at Tbilisi, and the prototype carried full Georgian Air Force markings.<ref name="Su-25KM">Yefim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.130-132</ref>

The aircraft was enhanced with the most advanced avionics, designed to elevate its unique capabilities and to provide a head-start into the 21st century as a model for close-attack aircraft. Avionics include [[Glass cockpit]] arrangement, [[digital map]] generator, display and sight helmet, computerized weapons system, complete mission pre-plan capability and fully redundant backup modes. Performance enhancements include: highly accurate navigation, pinpoint weapon delivery systems, all weather and day/night performance, NATO compatibility, high level of situational awareness, state-of-the art safety and survivability features, advanced onboard debriefing capabilities complying with international requirements as described in this [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ1Rj-ytg6c video].<ref name="Su-25KM" />

===Other variants===
The [[Sukhoi Su-28]] was built as a variant of the Su-25UB, which adopted the role of primary trainer and demonstrator.

==Combat service==
===Soviet War in Afghanistan===
On 19 July 1981 the 200th Independent "Shturmovaya" Air Squadron was assigned to Shindand airbase, being the first Su-25 unit deployed in Afghanistan. Their main task was to conduct air strikes against mountain military positions, buildings and houses controlled by the Afghan rebels.<ref>Yafim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.133-135</ref>

During the entire [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]], the Su-25s launched a total of 139 guided missiles of all types against [[Mujahideen]] positions. On average each aircraft performed 360 sorties per year, which was considerably higher than any other combat type in [[Afghanistan]]. By the end of the war, the number of Su-25s deployed to Afghanistan had reached around 50 and they had carried out a total of 60,000 sorties, while 21 aircraft were lost in combat operations.<ref>Yafim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.135-147</ref>

===Iran-Iraq War===
The Su-25 also saw combat during the [[Iran-Iraq War]], which started in 1980 and ended in 1989. The first Su-25s were commissioned by the [[Iraqi Air Force]] in 1987 and performed about 900 combat sorties, carrying out the bulk of the offensive strikes. In the most intensive periods of fighting each Su-25 was performing up to fifteen sorties per day. There was one recorded incident where an Iraqi Su-25 was shot down by an Iranian [[MIM-23 Hawk|Hawk]] [[surface to air missile]], bu the pilot managed to eject. After the end of the war, [[Saddam Hussein]] decorated all of the Iraqi Air Force's Su-25 pilots with the country's highest [[military decoration]]. <ref>Yafim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.148</ref>
                          
===Gulf War===
During the [[Gulf War]] (or [[Operation Desert Storm]]), the air superiority of the coalition forces was so great that the majority of Iraqi Su-25s did not even manage to get airborne from their own bases. On 25 January 1991, seven Iraqi Air Force Su-25s fled from Iraq and landed on the territory of their former enemy, Iran. <ref>[http://www.janes.com/defence/air_forces/news/jdw/jdw060913_1_n.shtml Iran bolsters Su-25 fleet] Jane's Defence Weekly, 13 September 2006</ref>

On the evening of 6 February 1991, two [[US Air Force]] [[F-15|F-15C Eagle]] fighters of the 53rd Tactical Fighter Squadron, operating out of Al Kharj Air Base in [[Saudi Arabia]], intercepted a pair of Iraqi [[MiG-21]]s and a pair of Su-25s. All four Iraqi aircraft were shot down, both Su-25s coming down in the desert not far from the border with Iran. This was the single air battle during the entire war, in which Iraqi Su-25s were involved.<ref>Yafim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.149</ref>
                                                
===2001 Macedonia Conflict=== 
The Su-25s were widely used by the [[Military of the Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian Air Force]] during [[2001 Macedonia conflict]] against Albanian Separatists starting with 24 June. The most successfull operation took place on 10 August 2001 when they attacked Albanian terrorists located in the village of [[Raduša]], where sixteen Macedonian soldiers had been ambushed and killed in the previous two days. <ref name="Operators4">Yafim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.100-102</ref>

*'''{{AFG}}''': In Afghanistan Su-25s were handed over by the [[Soviet Union]] in the period 1986-1990 and their number varied between twelve and sixty aircraft if citing open-source [[newspapers]]. The actual number of Su-25s has never been established, nor indeed whether any remain in the [[Afghan Air Force]] service. Since no evidence of Afghan operation of the Su-25 has emerged during recent allied operations, it is likely the "''Frogfoot''" was never actually acquired by the country. <ref> Sukhoi Su-25 ''Frogfoot'', Yafim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.89</ref>

*'''{{ANG}}''': An agreement was reached at the beginning of 1988 between the Soviet Union and Angola for the delivery of a squadron of Su-25s, comprising twelve single-seat Su-25Ks and two Su-25UBKs trainers. Later, these numbers were augmented by at least a further three two seaters. <ref> Yafim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.90-91</ref>

*'''{{ARM}}''': Following the break-up of the Soviet Union, Armenia had no Su-25s in its inventory, but after the start of the conflict in [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] in 1991-2, the newly independent [[Republic of Armenia]] unofficially acquired a small number of aircraft (11 single-seaters and four Su-25UBs).<ref name="Operators3">Yafim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.92</ref><ref name="awst_20070115">"World Military Aircraft Inventory", Aerospace Source Book 2007, ''[[Aviation Week & Space Technology]]'', [[January 15]] [[2007]].</ref>

*'''{{AZE}}''': Like Armenia, Azerbaidjan did not inherit any Su-25s after the collapse of the USSR, but a single aircraft was obtained in April 1992, as the consequence of a pilot defecting from the [[Russian Air Force]] base at Sital-Chai. Later, Azerbaidjan acquired at least five Su-25s through secret channels, although one aircraft has been obtained as the result of yet another defection, this time from the [[Georgian Air Force]]. Other aircraft must have been acquired later, since in 2001, the [[Azerbaijan Air Force]] still had three of the type in its inventory, although it is believed that four Su-25s were shot down in combat operations against Armenia relating to Nagorno-Karabakh.<ref name="Operators3" />

*'''{{BLR}}''': After the break-up of the Soviet Union, Belarus was the second member state of the [[CIS]], after [[Russia]], to posses a significant number of Su-25s. Currently, seventy Su-25s and six Su-25UB are operational and concentrated at Lida air base. <ref>Yafim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.93</ref>

[[Image:Su25bg gra.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bulgarian Air Force]] Su-25.]]
*'''{{BUL}}''': Bulgaria was the second [[Warsaw Pact]] country to obtain the Su-25, acquiring its first examples of both Su-25K and the Su-25UBK in 1985. The aircraft were intended to replace the obsolete [[MiG-17|MiG-17F ''Fresco-C'']] which had been the backbone of the [[Bulgarian Air Force]] fighter-bomber fleet for many years. Twenty Su-25Ks and three Su-25UBKs were commissioned and are currently operational at [[Bezmer]] air base. <ref>Yafim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.94</ref>

*'''{{COD}}''': In late 1999, the [[Tbilisi]] Aerospace Manufacturing plant, signed a contract with the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] for the delivery of ten Su-25Ks to the [[Military of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Force Aerienne Congolaise]]. The deal was reported to be valued at 6 million [[US Dollars]], and the first four aircraft were delivered on board an [[An-124]] in November 1999. The remaining six aircraft were delivered in January 2000.<ref name="Operators2" />

*'''{{ETH}}''': A batch of four Su-25s were delivered to [[Ethiopia]] in the first quarter of 2000, comprising a pair of Su-25Ts and two Su-25UBKs combat trainers. The twin seaters were withdrawn from [[Russian Air Force]] service and modified in accordance to a special request by the [[Ethiopian Air Force]]. Since acquiring the aircraft, the Ethiopians has used them in combat operations against [[Eritrean]] insurgent groups. <ref name="Operators2">Yafim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.96</ref>

*'''{{GEO}}''': Georgia, which during the Soviet era had produced hundreds [[MiG-21|MiG-21U/UM/US]] "Mongol" trainers and scores of single-seat Su-25s at the Tbilisi plant, was left with virtually no air force or aircraft following the break-up of the Soviet Union. Only a very small number of single-seat Su-25s were actually taken on to the inventory of the newly formed [[Georgian Air Force]], these aircraft being examples which were left in the factory at the time of the declaration of independence. Currently Georgia has at its disposal up to eight Su-25s of various modification standards and one Su-25KM "''Scorpion''" (an upgraded version of the Su-25 in collaboration with [[Israel]]). <ref>Yafim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.97</ref>

*'''{{IRN}}''': On 21 January 1991, seven [[Iraqi Air Force]] Su-25s were flown to Iran, seeking a temporary safe haven from [[Operation Desert Storm]] attacks on major Iraqi military installations. In effect, these Iraqi aircraft were considered by the Iranians to be a gift from their former long-term adversary, although as a result of lack of spare parts, documentation and, more importantly, training, these aircraft were never flown by the [[Iranian Air Force]]. Iran's [[Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Air Force]] has added at least six new aircraft to its inventory and likely restored ex-Iraqi Su-25s to flight status as well.<ref>[http://www.janes.com/defence/air_forces/news/jdw/jdw060913_1_n.shtml Iran bolsters Su-25 fleet] Jane's Defence Weekly, 13 September 2006</ref> 

*'''{{KAZ}}''': The [[Military of Kazakhstan|Kazakh Air Force]] received twelve single-seat Su-25s and two Su-25UB trainers in December 1995, as compensatory payment for the return of the [[Tu-95|Tu-95MS "''Bear-H''"]] strategic bombers which had been rapidly flown out of the republic at the time of the collapse of the USSR. The Kazakh Su-25s are located at [[Chimkent]] air base in the south of the country.<ref name="Operators" />

*'''{{MKD}}''': Macedonia purchased three single-seat Su-25s and one Su-25UB following incursions and attacks by [[Albanian]] separatists. The aircraft were supplied by the [[Ukrainian]] authorities, having been withdrawn from [[Ukrainian Air Force]].<ref>Yafim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.99</ref>

*'''{{PRK}}''': North Korea was the first [[Asia|Asian country]] to obtain the Su-25. In the 1950s the [[North Korean Air Force]] had accumulated useful experienceof operating the Su-25's piston-engined predecessor, the [[Il-10|Ilyushin Il-10 "''Beast''"]]. In the period from the end of 1987 until 1989, the PRK acquired a total of thirty-two single-seat Su-25Ks and four Su-25UBKs. The aircraft are based at [[Sonchon]] (80 km from [[Pyongyang]]), which has heavily fortified natural hangars, equipped with blast-proof doors capable of protecting the aircraft from conventional and [[nuclear]] explosions.<ref name="Operators4" />

*'''{{PER}}''': Peru received eighteen ex-Belarussian Air Force Su-25s in late 1998 from the Republic of Belarus, which refurbished them prior to delivery. The total was made up of ten single-seat and eight Su-25UB trainers. The aircraft were all build just before the downfall of the Soviet Union and thus represented the latest equipment standard for the Su-25. It is believed that up to December 2000, at least twenty-five light aircraft transporting [[cocaine]] had been shot down by the Peruvian Su-25s. <ref name="Operators4" />

[[Image:Suchoi Su-25.jpg|thumb|right|Russian Air Force Su-25SM in display.]]
*'''{{RUS}}''': Today, Russia possesses a reduced fleet of Su-25s, which are operated by "Shturmovoi" Assault Regiments. The major variants used are the single-seat Su-25, the twin-seat Su-25UB and the Su-25BM target-towing version. In addition, the [[Russian Air Force]] received a small number of Su-25T dedicated anti-tank variants, which have been tested with notable success in real combat situations in [[Chechnya]]. The Su-25 is also operated by the [[Russian Navy]], both in standard land-based Su-25 and Su-25UB guise, as well as in the specialised Su-25UTG role as a carrier-operable trainer. Overall, the number of Su-25s in current service with the Russian Air Force is 245 aircraft, with a further ten aircraft operated by the navy. The modernisation of the Russian Air Force Su-25s to reach Su-25SM level is underway. <ref>Yafim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.89</ref> The first modernized Su-25SM was delivered in August 2001, while another six were delivered in late December 2006, at [[Lipetsk]] air base. <ref>[[Air Forces Monthly]], July 2007 edition.</ref>

*'''{{SVK}}''': The [[Slovak Air Force]] received twelve Su-25Ks and one Su-25UBK following the dissolution of Czechoslovakia. The aircraft are currently based at the Slovak 33rd Air Base located at Malacky-Kuchnya. <ref>Yafim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.94-96</ref>

*'''{{TKM}}''': Following the downfall of the Soviet Union, the newly independent Republic of Turkmenistan was given forty-six Su-25s which had been assembled for storage on its territory up to that time. It is known that in accordance to an agreement between Georgia and Turkmenistan in 1999, Tbilisi Aerospace Manufacturing planned to refurbish forty-five Su-25s for the [[Military of Turkmenistan|Turkmenistan Air Force]] by way of payment owed by Georgia to the Asian republic for the delivery of [[natural gas]]. The refurbished aircraft were relocated at Ak-Tepe air base, and currently a total of eighteen operational Su-25s are known to be based there.<ref name="Operators4" />

*'''{{UKR}}''': Ukraine obtained ninety-two Su-25s, of differing variants, following independence in the wake of the break-up of the USSR. Currently, the [[Ukrainian Air Force]] operates around sixty Su-25, Su25UB and Su-25UTG, which are operated by the 299th Independent Assault Regiment (299 OShAP), based at [[Saki]], in the [[Crimea]], and the 456th Assault Regiment (456 ShAP) at [[Chortkiv]]. It is also known that up to thirty Su-25 are stored at 4070th Reserve Base. Evidently, three of the Su-25s which were sold to Macedonia came from this reserve pool.<ref name="Operators4" />

*'''{{UZB}}''': Until 1990, a [[Soviet Air Force]] pilot training centre was located at [[Chirchik]] air base in Uzbekistan, equipped with around twenty Su-25, Su-25UB and Su-25BM variants. In 1991, a small number of Su-25s were also located at [[Dzhizak]] air base, but after 1991 all the Su-25s in Uzbekistan were concentrated at Chirchik, operated by the 59th Fighter-Bomber Aviation Regiment (59 APIB) of the Soviet Air Force. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, all the Su-25s on the territory of the now independent Republic of Uzbekistan became the property of the new government.<ref name="Operators4" />

*'''{{CZE}}''': After the dissolution of [[Czechoslovakia]], the Czech Republic acquired twenty-four Su-25Ks and one Su-25UBK. In December 2000, the Czech Su-25s were retired from service and placed in storage at [[Přerov]] air base.<ref>Yafim Gordon and Alan Dawes, p.95</ref><ref>[http://www.scramble.nl/cz.htm Info about Czech air force], Scramble.nl</ref>

*'''{{IRQ}}''': During the course of the early phase of the Iran-Iraq War, Iraq approached the Soviet Union with a request to purchase a wide variety of military equipment. As a result, Iraq become the first non-Warsaw Pact country to obtain the Su-25K and Su-25UBK combat trainer. It is believed that Iraq received a total of 73 Su-25s, of which four were the Su-25UBK. In January 1998, the Iraqi Air Force still possessed twelve Su-25s, and at least three Su-25Ks were seen in a flypast over [[Baghdad]] in December 2002. However, the Su-25s were phased out immediately after the [[2003 Liberation of Iraq]].<ref name="Operators" />

*'''{{USSR}}''': passed aircraft onto successor states.
