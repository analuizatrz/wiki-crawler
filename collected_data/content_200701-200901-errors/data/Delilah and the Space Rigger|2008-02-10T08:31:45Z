"'''Delilah and the Space Rigger'''", a [[science fiction]] [[short story]] by [[Robert A. Heinlein]], is arguably one of the best [[feminist]] works of [[fiction]] ever written by a [[male]] [[author]]. One of his [[Future History]] stories, it originally appeared in ''Blue Book'' in December 1949 and was reprinted in his collection, ''[[The Green Hills of Earth (short story collection)|The Green Hills of Earth]]'' (and subsequently ''[[The Past Through Tomorrow]]'').

It concerns Gloria Brooks McNye, a Communications Engineer who takes a job as a [[radio]] technician and joins the all-male crew building a [[space station]], and her dispute with the construction superintendent who doesn't want any women "sniffing around my boys."  The superintendent is constantly putting his foot in his mouth with remarks like, "Mind what [Hammond] tells you.  He's a good man," only to hear a brisk, "I know, I trained him."  In the end, the superintendent is forced to admit that having a woman on the team has improved morale and efficiency, rather than causing a disruption, and he decides to stop discriminating on the basis of gender.  He also asks that a Chaplain be assigned to the station, reasoning, "We may need one anytime."
