A large part of the reef is protected by the [[Great Barrier Reef Marine Park]], which helps to limit the impact of human use, such as overfishing and tourism. Other environmental pressures to the reef and its [[ecosystem]] include water quality from [[runoff]], climate change accompanied by mass [[coral bleaching]], and cyclic outbreaks of the [[crown-of-thorns starfish]].

==Physiography==
The Great Barrier Reef is a distinct physiographic province of the larger [[East Australian Cordillera]] division. It encompasses the smaller [[Murray Islands]] physiographic section.<ref>''Physiographic Diagram of Australia'', A.K. Lobeck, by The Geological Press, Columbia University, New York, 1951. ... "to accompany text description and geological sections which were prepared by Joseph Gentilli and R.W. Fairbridge of the [[University of Western Australia]]"</ref>

The substrate of the GBR may have needed to build up from the sediment until the edge of the substrate was too far away for suspended sediments to have an inhibiting effect on coral growth.

According to the [[Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority]], the current, living reef structure is believed to have begun growing on the older platform about 20,000 years ago.<ref name = "GBRMPAage"/> The [[Australian Institute of Marine Science]] agrees, which places the beginning of the growth of the current reef at the time of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]]. At around that time, the sea level was {{convert|120|m|ft}} lower than it is today.
[[Image:Heron Island, Australia - View of Island from helicopter.JPG|right|thumb|[[Heron Island, Australia|Heron Island]], a coral cay in the southern Great Barrier Reef]]

From 20,000 years ago until 6,000 years ago, the [[Sea level rise|sea level rose]] steadily. As it rose, the corals could then grow higher on the hills of the coastal plain. By around 13,000 years ago the sea level was {{convert|60|m|ft}} lower than the present day, and corals began to grow around the hills of the coastal plain, which were, by then, [[Island#Continental islands|continental islands]]. As the sea level rose further still, most of the continental islands were submerged. The corals could then overgrow the hills, to form the present [[cay]]s and reefs. Sea level on the Great Barrier Reef has not risen significantly in the last 6,000 years.<ref name="AIMSage"/>The CRC Reef Research Centre estimates the age of the present, living reef structure at 6,000 to 8,000 years old.<ref name="CRCage"/>

[[Fringing reef]]s are distributed widely, but are most common towards the southern part of the Great Barrier Reef, attached to high islands, for example, the [[Whitsunday Islands]]. [[Lagoonal reef]]s are also found in the southern Great Barrier Reef, but there are some of these found further north, off the coast of [[Princess Charlotte Bay]]. [[Cresentic reef]]s are the most common shape of reef in the middle of the Great Barrier Reef system, for example the reefs surrounding [[Lizard Island]]. Cresentic reefs are also found in the far north of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, and in the Swain Reefs (20-22 degrees South). [[Planar reef]]s are found in the northern and southern parts of the Great Barrier Reef, near Cape York, Princess Charlotte Bay, and Cairns.

The rivers of north eastern Australia provide significant pollution of the Reef during tropical flood events with over 90% of this pollution being sourced from farms.<ref>{{cite web|date=2003|url=http://www.epa.qld.gov.au/register/p01258bs.pdf|title=Coastal water quality |work=The State of the Environment Report Queensland 2003 |publisher=Environment Protection Agency Queensland|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-06-07}}</ref> Farm run-off is polluted as a result of overgrazing and excessive [[fertiliser]] and pesticide use. Due to the range of human uses made of the water catchment area adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef, [[Water pollution|water quality]] has declined owing to the sediment and chemical [[Surface runoff|runoff]] from farming, and to loss of coastal [[wetland]]s which are a natural filter.<ref name= wetlands>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|year=|title=Wetlands|url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/key_issues/water_quality/wetlands|accessdate=2007-03-13}}</ref><ref name= "Brodie07">{{cite web |date=2007 |author=Brodie, J.|url=http://www.actfr.jcu.edu.au/Publications/ACTFRreports/06-07_NMZ%20technical%20final%20March%202007%20main.pdf|title=Nutrient management zones in the Great Barrier Reef Catchment: A decision system for zone selection|publisher=Australian Centre for Tropical Freshwater Research|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-06-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Australian Government Productivity Commission|year=2003|title=Industries, Land Use and Water Quality in the Great Barrier Reef Catchment - Key Points|url=http://www.pc.gov.au/study/gbr/finalreport/keypoints.html|accessdate=2006-05-29}}</ref> It is thought that the mechanism behind poor water quality affecting the reefs is due to increased light and oxygen [[Competition (biology)|competition]] from [[algae]].<ref name= waterquality>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|year=2006|title=Principal water quality influences on Great Barrier Reef ecosystems|url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/key_issues/water_quality/principal_influences.html|accessdate=2006-10-22}}</ref>

The [[crown-of-thorns starfish]] is a coral reef predator which preys on coral polyps. Large outbreaks of these starfish can devastate reefs. In 2000, an outbreak contributed to a loss of 66% of live coral cover on sampled reefs in a study by the CRC Reefs Research Centre.<ref name="cots 1999-2000">{{cite web|url=http://www.reef.crc.org.au/publications/techreport/techrept32.htm|title=CRC REEF RESEARCH CENTRE TECHNICAL REPORT No. 32 — Crown-of-thorns starfish(Acanthaster planci) in the central Great Barrier Reef region.

The unsustainable [[overfishing]] of [[keystone species]], such as the [[Triton (mollusk)|Giant Triton]], can cause disruption to [[food chain]]s vital to life on the reef. Fishing also impacts the reef through increased pollution from boats, [[by-catch]] of unwanted species (such as dolphins and turtles) and reef [[habitat destruction]] from [[trawling]], [[anchors]] and nets.<ref>{{cite web|author=CSIRO Marine Research|year=1998|title=Environmental Effects of Prawn Trawling|url=http://www.marine.csiro.au/LeafletsFolder/26trawl/26.html|accessdate=2006-05-28}}</ref> As of the middle of 2004, approximately one-third of the [[Great Barrier Reef Marine Park]] is protected from species removal of any kind, including fishing, without written permission.<ref>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|title=Marine Park Zoning|url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/management/zoning/index.html|accessdate=2006-08-08}}</ref>

Other threats to the Great Barrier Reef include shipping accidents, oil spills, and tropical cyclones.

==Human use==
The Great Barrier Reef has long been known to and utilised by the [[Aboriginal Australian]] and [[Torres Strait Islander]] peoples. Aboriginal Australians have been living in the area from at least 40,000 years ago,<ref>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|date=2006 date|title=Fact Sheet No. 4 - Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People and the Great Barrier Reef Region|url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/2142/Fact_Sheet_04_IPLU.pdf|accessdate=2006-05-28}}</ref> and Torres Strait Islanders since about 10,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|date=|title=reefED - GBR Traditional Owners|url=http://www.reefed.edu.au/explorer/traditional_owners/index.html|accessdate=2006-05-28}}</ref> For these 70 or so clan groups, the reef is also an important part of their culture and spirituality.<ref name= traditionalfishing>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/key_issues/conservation/natural_values/indigenous|title=Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Culture & Dugongs and Turtles|accessdate=2007-05-23}}</ref>

The reef first became known to [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]] when the [[HM Bark Endeavour|HM Bark ''Endeavour'']], captained by explorer [[James Cook]], ran [[wiktionary:aground|aground]] there on [[June 11]] [[1770]], sustaining considerable damage.

===Management===
{{main|Great Barrier Reef Marine Park}}
After the Royal Commissions' findings, in 1975 the [[Government of Australia]] created the Great Barrier Reef [[Marine Park]] and defined what activities were prohibited on the Great Barrier Reef.<ref>{{cite web| author=Commonwealth of Australia| year=1975| title=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975| url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/gbrmpa1975257/index.html| accessdate=2006-08-30}}</ref> The park is managed, in partnership with the [[Government of Queensland]], through the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to ensure that it is widely understood and used in a sustainable manner. A combination of zoning, management plans, permits, education and incentives (such as [[eco-tourism]] certification) are used in the effort to conserve the Great Barrier Reef.

In July 2004, a new zoning plan was brought into effect for the entire Marine Park, and has been widely acclaimed as a new global benchmark for the conservation of [[marine ecosystem]]s.<ref>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|year=2003|title=Zoning Plan 2003|url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/10591/Zoning_Plan.pdf|accessdate=2006-10-02}} (PDF)</ref> The rezoning was based on the application of systematic conservation planning techniques, using the [[marxan|MARXAN]] software.<ref>Fernandes et al. (2005) ''Establishing representative no-take areas in the Great Barrier Reef: large-scale implementation of theory on marine protected areas'', Conservation Biology, 19(6), 1733-1744.</ref> While protection across the Marine Park was improved, the highly protected zones increased from 4.5% to over 33.3%.<ref>{{cite web|author=World Wildlife Fund Australia|year=|title=Great Barrier Reef - WWF-Australia|url=http://www.wwf.org.au/ourwork/oceans/gbr/|accessdate=2006-11-10}}</ref> At the time, it was the largest [[Marine Protected Area|marine protected area]] in the world, although as of 2006, the [[Northwestern Hawaiian Islands National Monument]] is the largest.<ref name=BBC_5083974>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5083974.stm Bush to protect Hawaiian islands], [[BBC News]], [[15 June]] [[2006]]</ref>

In 2006, a review was undertaken of the ''Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975''. Some recommendations of the review are that there should be no further zoning plan changes until 2013, and that every five years, a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] Outlook Report should be published, examining the health of the Great Barrier Reef, the management of the reef, and environmental pressures.<ref name="1975review"/><ref>{{cite web

===Tourism===
Due to its vast [[biodiversity]], warm clear waters and its accessibility from the floating guest facilities called '[[live aboard]]s', the reef is a very popular destination for tourists, especially [[scuba diving|scuba divers]]. Many cities along the Queensland coast offer daily boat trips to the reef. Several continental and coral cay islands have been turned into [[resort]]s, including the pristine resort island of [[Lady Elliot Island]].

As the largest commercial activity in the region, it was estimated in 2003 that tourism in the Great Barrier Reef generates over [[Australian dollar|AU$]]4 billion annually.<ref>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|year=2003|title=Summary report of the social and economic impacts of the rezoning of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.|url=http://www.reefed.edu.au/rap/pdf/JUG_SR_09-12-03.pdf|accessdate=2006-10-19}} (PDF)</ref> (A 2005 estimate puts the figure at [[AU$]]5.1 billion.<ref name = 2005Brochure>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|year=2005|title=Protecting Biodiversity Brochure 2005|url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/info_services/publications/brochures/index.html|accessdate=2006-11-11}}</ref>) Approximately two million people visit the Great Barrier Reef each year.<ref>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|year= |title=Number of Tourists Visiting The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park| url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/key_issues/tourism/gbr_visitation/numbers|accessdate=2006-10-12}} </ref> Although most of these visits are managed in partnership with the marine [[Tourism|tourism industry]], there are some very popular areas near shore (such as [[Green Island National Park|Green Island]]) that have suffered damage due to overfishing and land based run off.

A variety of boat tours and cruises are offered, from single day trips, to longer voyages. Boat sizes range from [[dinghies]] to [[superyacht]]s.<ref>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|year=2005|title=What You Do|work= Onboard - The Tourism Operator's Handbook for the Great Barrier Reef|url=http://www.tourismoperators.reefhq.com.au/yourproduct/index.html|accessdate=2006-11-14}}</ref> [[Glass bottom boat|Glass-bottomed boats]] and [[underwater observatory|underwater observatories]] are also popular, as are [[helicopter]] flights. By far, the most popular tourist activities on the Great Barrier Reef are [[snorkelling]] and diving, for which pontoons are often used, and the area is often enclosed by nets. The outer part of the Great Barrier Reef is favoured for such activities, due to water quality.

Management of tourism in the Great Barrier Reef is geared towards making tourism [[ecological sustainability|ecologically sustainable]]. A daily fee is levied that goes towards research of the Great Barrier Reef.<ref name = "2005Brochure"/> This fee ends up being 20% of the GBRMPA's income.<ref>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|year=2005|title=How is the Money Used?|work=Onboard - The Tourism Operator's Handbook for the Great Barrier Reef |url=http://www.tourismoperators.reefhq.com.au/emc/use_of/index.html|accessdate=2006-11-11}}</ref> Plans of management are also in place for the popular tourist destinations of Cairns and the [[Whitsunday Islands]], which account for 85% of the tourism in the region.<ref name = "2005Brochure"/>
Policies on [[cruise ship]]s, [[bareboat charter]]s, and anchorages limit the traffic on the Great Barrier Reef.<ref name = "2005Brochure"/>

===Fishing===
The [[fishing industry]] in the Great Barrier Reef, controlled by the Queensland Government, is worth [[Australian dollar|AU$]]1 billion annually.<ref>{{cite web|author=Access Economics Pty Ltd|year=2005|title=Measuring the economic and financial value of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park|url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/about_us/documents/economic_values_report.pdf|accessdate=2007-03-16}} (PDF)</ref> It employs approximately 2000 people, and fishing in the Great Barrier Reef is pursued commercially, for recreation, and as a traditional means for feeding one's family.<ref name= traditionalfishing/> [[Wonky hole]]s in the reef provide particularly productive fishing areas.
