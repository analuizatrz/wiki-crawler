{{Politics of Canada}}
The '''monarchy of Canada''', also known as the '''Canadian monarchy''',<ref>[http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/fr-rf/index_e.cfm Department of Canadian Heritage: The Canadian Monarchy]</ref><ref name="Buck1" /> is a [[constitution]]al system of government in which a hereditary [[monarch]] is the [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] and [[head of state]] of [[Canada]],<ref name="Forsey2">[http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/idb/forsey/institutions_02-e.asp Forsey, Eugene; ''How Canadians Govern Themselves'': The Institutions of Our Federal Government; Library of Parliament; sixth edition; pg. 1]</ref> forming the core of the country's [[Westminster system|Westminster style]] [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[democracy]].<ref name="Forsey1">[http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/idb/forsey/intro_01-e.asp Forsey, Eugene; ''How Canadians Govern Themselves'': Introduction; Library of Parliament; sixth edition; pg. 1]</ref> The terms ''[[The Crown|Crown in Right of]] Canada'', ''Her Majesty in Right of Canada'', or ''The Queen in Right of Canada'' may also be used to refer to the entire [[Government of Canada#Executive power|executive of the government of Canada]].

The present monarch is [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] &ndash; officially styled [[Style of the Canadian sovereign|Queen of Canada]] ([[French language|French]]: ''Reine du Canada'') &ndash; who has [[Queen regnant|reigned]] since [[February 6]], [[1952]]. She, her [[List of Canadian monarchs#List of Royal Consorts of Canada|consort]], [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], their eldest son and the [[heir apparent]],<ref>[http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/special/royalvisit/english.htm Department of Canadian Heritage: Prince of Wales Royal Visit]</ref> [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]], and other members of the [[#Canadian Royal Family|Canadian Royal Family]] undertake various public ceremonial functions across Canada and on behalf of the country abroad. However, the Queen is the only member of the Royal Family with any [[Constitution of Canada|constitutional]] role, holding ultimate [[Executive (government)|executive authority]] over [[Government of Canada|the government]] and [[Law of Canada|legislative structure]] of Canada,<ref name="Forsey1" /><ref>[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/const/c1867_e.html Constitution Act, 1867; 30 & 31 Victoria, c. 3. (U.K.); III.9; March 29, 1867]</ref> though her [[Royal Prerogative]] remains bound by policies and procedures set down either by laws enacted in parliament or by [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|convention]]s and precedents,<ref name="Forsey2" /> leaving the day-to-day exercise of executive power to the [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]]. While several powers are the sovereign's alone, most of the royal constitutional and ceremonial duties in Canada are carried out by the Queen's representative, the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]],<ref name="Forsey2" /> at present [[Michaëlle Jean]]; as such, the Governor General can sometimes be referred to as the [[de facto head of state|''de facto'' head of state]].<ref>[http://www.gg.ca/governor_general/role_e.asp Governor General: Role]</ref> In each of [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canada's provinces]] the monarch is represented by a [[Lieutenant-Governor (Canada)|Lieutenant-Governor]].<ref name="Forsey2" /> The territories are not [[Sovereignty|sovereign]], and thus do not have a [[viceroy]].

The Canadian monarch, besides reigning in Canada, separately serves as [[head of state]] for each of fifteen other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries,<ref name="Forsey1" /> putting Canada in a [[personal union]] relationship with those other states. This developed from the former colonial relationship of these countries to the [[United Kingdom]], but they are now independent and the monarchy of each is legally distinct. As such, the Canadian Crown also has [[Canadian royal symbols|uniquely Canadian symbols]], sometimes being [[Colloquialism|colloquially]] dubbed the ''Maple Crown'',<ref>[http://www.pch.gc.ca/pc-ch/discours-speeches/2007/kenney/2007-04-23_e.cfm The Honourable Jason Kenney; Talking Points for The Honourable Jason Kenney, Secretary of State (Multiculturalism and Canadian Identity); Lieutenant Governors Meeting; Regina, Saskatchewan; April 23, 2007]</ref> a term first coined by Governor General [[Albert Grey, 4th Earl Grey|Lord Grey]] in 1905.<ref>Lord Grey stated about his inauguration of [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]] in a [[telegram]] to King [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]]: "[each one] a new leaf in Your Majesty's Maple Crown". Grey Papers; Grey to Edward VII; 4 March and 1 Sept. 1905</ref>

==Origins==
[[Image:Queen of canada wob.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Her Majesty Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] wearing the [[Monarch|Sovereign]]'s insignia of the [[Order of Canada]] and the [[Order of Military Merit (Canada)|Order of Military Merit]].]]
The current Canadian [[monarchy]] can trace its ancestral lineage back to the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]] period, and ultimately back to the [[List of kings of the Angles|kings of the Angles]] and the early [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scottish kings]]. Parts of the territories that today comprise Canada were claimed under King [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] in 1534, while others were claimed by Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in 1583; both of whom are [[blood relative]]s of the current monarch. Throughout the 18th century, via war and treaties, the [[New France|Canadian colonies of France]] were ceded to King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].  The [[Canadian Confederation|colonies were confederated]] by Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]] in 1867 to form [[Canada]] as a [[Monarchy|kingdom]] in its own right,<ref name="Heritage">{{PDFlink|[http://www.pch.gc.ca/special/royalvisit/ENGLISH.pdf The Crown in Canada]|376&nbsp;KB}}</ref> and the country was proclaimed fully independent, via [[Constitution Act, 1982|constitutional patriation]], by Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] in 1982.

==International and domestic aspects==
Canada, as one of the [[Commonwealth realm]]s, is in [[personal union]] with fifteen other states within the 53-member [[Commonwealth of Nations]].<ref>Zines, ''The High Court and the Constitution'', 4th ed. (1997) at 314: "The Queen as monarch of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand is in a position resembling that of the King of Scotland and of England between 1603 and 1707 when two independent countries had a common sovereign"; the relationship between England and Scotland during those years is described as a [[personal union]].</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title = The Status of the British Commonwealth in International Law|author = P.

[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1999/30.html R v Foreign Secretary; Ex parte Indian Association, QB 892 at 928; as referenced in High Court of Australia: Sue v Hill [1999] HCA 30; 23 June 1999; S179/1998 and B49/1998]</ref> meaning the Canadian monarchy has both a separate and a shared character, and the monarchy has also thus ceased to be an exclusively British institution, although it has often been called ''British'' since this time (in both legal and common language) for reasons historical, political, and of convenience. On all matters of the Canadian state, the monarch is advised solely by Canadian federal [[Minister of the Crown|Ministers of the Crown]],<ref name="Buck1">[http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page4918.asp Buckingham Palace: The Queen and Commonwealth: Canada]</ref> and, effective with the [[Constitution Act, 1982]], no British or other realm government can advise the monarch on any matters pertinent to Canada.<ref>In 1997, [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] intended to offer a [[Life Peer]]age to Canadian businessman [[Conrad Black]]. Citing the 1919 [[Nickle Resolution]], the Canadian government advised the Queen that they have objected to such honours for many years. If Blair had not backed down, the Queen would have been in the situation of having to grant an [[Honor|honour]] on the advice of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and to object to the same as Queen of Canada on the advice of then Prime Minister of Canada [[Jean Chrétien]]. The problem was resolved when Black renounced his Canadian citizenship. Canada raised no further objections and he was granted his peerage, becoming Lord Black of [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Crossharbour]].</ref>
:''Further information: [[Commonwealth realm#The Crown in the Commonwealth realms|Commonwealth realm: The Crown in the Commonwealth realms]]''

===Title===
{{Main|Style of the Canadian sovereign}}
The shared and domsestic aspects of the Crown are also highlighted in the sovereign's Canadian title, currently ''Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom, Canada and Her other Realms and Territories Queen, [[Head of the Commonwealth]], [[Defender of the Faith]]'' ([[French language|French]]: ''{{lang|fr|Elizabeth Deux, par la grâce de Dieu, Reine du Royaume-Uni, du Canada et de ses autres royaumes et territoires, Chef du Commonwealth, Défenseur de la Foi}}'').<ref name="DCHtitle">[http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/fr-rf/titre_e.cfm Canadian Heritage: Royal Style and Titles Act; 1 - 2 Elizabeth II; Chap. 9; February 11, 1953]</ref> The sovereign's role specifically as Queen of Canada, as well as her status as monarch of other nations, is communicated by mentioning Canada separately from, but along with, the Queen's other lands.<ref name="DCHtitle" /> Typically, the sovereign is styled ''Queen of Canada'', and is addressed as such when in Canada or performing duties on behalf of Canada abroad. Also, although the Queen's Canadian titles include "[[Defender of the Faith]]/''{{lang|fr|Défenseur de la Foi}}''," neither the Queen nor any of her governors has any religious role in Canada; there have never been any [[established church]]es in Canada.

=== Finance ===
The sovereign only draws from Canadian coffers for support in the performance of her duties when in Canada or acting as Queen of Canada abroad; Canadians do not pay any money to the Queen, either towards personal income or to support royal residences outside of Canada. This applies equally to other members of the [[#Canadian Royal Family|Royal Family]].<ref name="CCC">[http://www.monarchist.ca/new/docs/costofcrown.html ''The Cost of Canada's Constitutional Monarchy: $1.10 per Canadian'']</ref> Normally, tax dollars pay only for the costs associated with the Governor General and ten Lieutenant Governors in the exercise of the powers of the Crown, including travel, security, residences, offices, ceremonies, and the like.<ref name="CCC" />

The provincial and federal governments keep records of expenditures associated with the Crown, but no official report on the full cost of the monarchy is compiled. Every three years, the [[Monarchist League of Canada]] issues a survey, based on the various federal and provincial budgets, expenditures and estimates, that outlines a yearly cost for the functioning of the Crown. The 2005 survey found that the institution cost Canadians roughly $49&nbsp;million in 2004.<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.monarchist.ca/new/docs/Report.pdf ''$1.53 per Canadian: The Cost of Canada's Constitutional Monarchy, 2005'']|1.08&nbsp;MB}}</ref> Previous surveys found that the overall cost of the Canadian Crown was $22&nbsp;million in 1999,<ref>[http://www.monarchist.ca/new/docs/costs.html ''The Cost of Canada's Constitutional Monarchy: 74 Cents per Canadian'']</ref> and $34&nbsp;million in 2002.<ref name="CCC" /><ref>[http://members.tripod.com/~constantian/expense2.html The Constantian Society. The [[Constantian Society]]'s detailed comparison of the costs of monarchies versus [[republic]]s.]</ref> (This does not take into account the inflation of the [[Canadian Dollar]] over these years.)

===Succession===
[[Image:Charles, Prince of Wales.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Charles, Prince of Wales]], is the [[heir apparent]] to the Canadian throne.]]
Succession is by [[primogeniture|male-preference primogeniture]] governed by the provisions of the [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement, 1701]], and the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights, 1689]]. This legislation limits the succession to the natural (i.e. non-[[adoption|adopted]]), legitimate descendants of [[Sophia of Hanover|Sophia, Electress of Hanover]], and stipulates that the monarch cannot be a [[Roman Catholic]], nor married to one, and must be in communion with the [[Church of England]] upon ascending the throne, clauses that have led to [[O'Donohue v. Canada|legal challenge]]. Though these constitutional laws, as they apply to Canada, now lie within the control of the [[Parliament of Canada|Canadian parliament]],<ref name="Topo">[http://www.monarchist.ca/mc/invisibl.htm Toporoski, Richard; ''Monarchy Canada'': The Invisible Crown; Summer, 1998]</ref> via adopting the Statute of Westminster Canada agreed not to change its rules of succession without the unanimous consent of the other realms, unless explicitly leaving the shared monarchy relationship; a situation that applies [[Symmetry|symmetrically]] in all the other realms, including the United Kingdom, and which has been likened to a [[treaty]] amongst these countries.<ref>Justice Rouleau in a 2003 [[O'Donohue v. Canada|court ruling]] wrote that "Union under the&nbsp;... Crown together with other Commonwealth countries [is a] constitutional principle". [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2003/2003canlii41404/2003canlii41404.html O’Donohue v. Canada, 2003 CanLII 41404 (ON S.C.)]</ref> Thus, Canada's line of succession remains identical to [[Succession to the British Throne|that of the United Kingdom]]; however, there is no provision in Canadian law that states the King or Queen of Canada must be the same person as the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|King or Queen of the United Kingdom]]; if the United Kingdom were to breach the convention set out in the preamble to the Statute of Westminster and change the line of succession to the British throne without Canada's consent, the alteration would have no effect on the reigning sovereign of Canada or his or her heirs and successors.<ref name="Topo" /> As such, the rules for succession are not fixed, but may be changed by a constitutional amendment.

Upon a ''[[demise of the Crown]]'' (the death or abdication of a sovereign) it is customary for the accession of the new monarch to be publicly [[Proclamation|proclaimed]] by the Governor General, on behalf of the [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada]], which meets at [[Rideau Hall]] after the ascession. [[Ted McWhinney]] theorised that failure to make this proclamation would result in an empty throne for Canada, leaving the Governor General as full head of state;<ref>McWhinney, Edward (2005). The Governor General and the Prime Ministers. Vancouver: Ronsdale Press, 16-17; 34. ISBN 1-55380-031-1</ref> however, the proposal was met with criticism from legal experts.<ref>Ian Holloway, Dean of Law of the University of Western Ontario, as quoted in [http://www.monarchist.ca/cmn/2005/Spring_2005_CMN.pdf Ed.; ''Canadian Monarchist News'': Liberal Stalking Horse for Stealth End of Monarchy?; Spring, 2005; No. 23; pg. 2]</ref> Regardless of any proclamations, the late sovereign's heir immediately and automatically succeeds, without any need for confirmation or further ceremony; hence arises the phrase "[[The King is dead. Long live the King!]]" Following an appropriate period of [[mourning]], the monarch is also [[coronation of the British monarch|coronated]] in the United Kingdom, though this ritual is not necessary for a sovereign to reign; for example, [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]] was never crowned, yet was undoubtedly king during his short time on the throne. All incumbent [[viceroy]]s, judges, [[Canadian civil service|civil servants]], legislators, military officers, etc., are not affected by the death of the monarch, as per the 1927 Act Respecting the Demise of the Crown, though they are required to re-take the [[Oath of Allegiance (Canada)|Oath of Allegiance]].<ref>[http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/department/history/dcer/details-en.asp?intRefId=3497 Documents on Canadian External Relations; Volume #18 - 1, Chapter 1, Part 1; Death and Accession of the Monarch]</ref> After an individual ascends the throne, he or she typically continues to reign until death. Monarchs are not allowed to unilaterally abdicate; the only Canadian monarch to abdicate, Edward VIII, did so with the authorization of the Canadian government granted in [[His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936|His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act, 1936]]. A special [[Act of Parliament|Act of Canadian Parliament]] &ndash; the [[Succession to the Throne Act 1937|Succession to the Throne Act, 1937]] &ndash; later confirmed this in law.

==Constitutional role==
[[Image:EIIR-Canadian Parliament.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] reads the [[Throne Speech]] in a joint session of the [[Canadian Parliament]], 1977, accompanied by her husband, [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]].]]
[[Constitution of Canada|Canada's constitution]] is made up of a variety of statutes and conventions that are either British or Canadian in origin, which gives Canada a similar parliamentary system of government to the other Commonwealth realms. All powers of state are constitutionally reposed in the monarch,<ref>[http://www.pco-bcp.gc.ca/docs/InformationResources/Publications/guidemin/accountable-guide2007_e.pdf ''Accountable Government: A Guide for Ministers and Secretaries of State; Library and Archives Cataloguing in Publication; 2007; p. 49]</ref> who is represented at the federal level by the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] {{ndash}} appointed by the monarch on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Canada]] {{ndash}} and at the provincial level by [[Lieutenant-Governor (Canada)|Lieutenant Governor]]s{{ndash}} appointed by the Governor General upon the advice of the Prime Minister, usually in consultation with the relevant provincial premier,<ref name="McCullough">[http://www.filibustercartoons.com/lg.htm McCullough, John; ''Interview with Lieutenant Governor Iona Campagnolo''; April 23, 2004]</ref> and the monarch is informed of the Prime Minister's decision before the Governor General gives [[Royal Assent]].<ref>[http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/idb/forsey/index-e.asp Forsey, Eugene; ''How Canadians Govern Themselves''; Parliament of Canada]</ref> Most of the Queen's domestic duties are performed by these [[Viceroy|vice-regal]] representatives.

All institutions of government are said to act under the sovereign's authority; as such, the constitution instructs that any change to the position of the monarch, or the monarch's representatives in Canada, requires the consent of the [[Canadian Senate|Senate]], the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]], and the legislative assemblies of all the provinces. The government of Canada is also thus formally referred to as ''Her Majesty's Government in Canada''.<ref name="US">[http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/department/history/dcer/details-en.asp?intRefid=4363 Documents on Canadian External Relations: Chapter VIII: Relations with the United States; Part III]</ref> However, since the early 1970s, though the constitutional arrangements have not changed, the government is more often addressed simply as ''The [[Government of Canada]]''.

===Executive===
The role of the Queen and the Governor General is both legal and practical; the Crown is regarded as a corporation, in which several parts share the authority of the whole, with the Queen as the person at the centre of the constitutional construct.<ref name="Murdoch" />

The vast powers that belong to the Crown are collectively known as the [[Royal Prerogative]]. Parliamentary approval is not required for the exercise of the Royal Prerogative; moreover, the consent of the Crown must be obtained before either of the houses of parliament may even debate a bill affecting the sovereign's prerogatives or interests. While the Royal Prerogative is extensive, it is not unlimited. For example, the monarch does not have the prerogative to impose and collect new taxes; such an action requires the authorization of an [[Act of Parliament]].

====Queen-in-Council====
In Canada's constitutional system, one of the main duties of the Crown is to appoint a [[prime minister]], who thereafter heads the [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]] and [[Advice (constitutional)|advises the monarch and Governor General]] on how to execute their executive powers over all aspects of government operations and foreign affairs. Though the monarch's power is still a part of the executive process{{ndash}} the operation of the Cabinet is technically known as the ''[[Queen-in-Council]]'' (or ''Governor-in-Council''){{ndash}} the advice tendered is typically binding. Since the death of [[Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] in 1714, the last monarch to head the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|British Cabinet]] (when almost all of Canada was still French colonial territory), the monarch ''reigns'' but does not ''rule''; in Canada, this has been true since the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] ended the reign of Canada's last absolute monarch, King [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]. This means that the monarch's role, and thereby the vicegerents' role, is almost entirely symbolic and cultural, acting as a symbol of the legal authority under which all governments and agencies operate, while the Cabinet directs the use of the Royal Prerogative, which includes the privilege to declare war, maintain the [[Queen's peace]], and direct the actions of the [[Canadian Forces]], as well as to [[Parliamentary session|summon and prorogue parliament]], and [[Dropping the writ|call elections]]. However, it is important to note that the Royal Prerogative belongs to the Crown, and not to any of the ministers, though it may sometimes appear that way,<ref name="Murdoch" /> and the royal figures may unilaterally use these powers in exceptional [[constitutional crisis]] situations,<ref name="Forsey">{{cite web|last=Forsey|first=Eugene|title=''How Canadians Govern Themselves'': Parliamentary Government (pg. 2)|publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/idb/forsey/parl_gov_02-e.asp|quote=In very exceptional circumstances, the Governor General could refuse a request for a fresh election.}}<br>{{cite web|last=Forsey|first=Eugene|title=''How Canadians Govern Themselves'': The Institutions of Our Federal Government (pg. 2)|publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/idb/forsey/institutions_02-e.asp|quote=But they almost invariably must act on their Ministers’ advice, though there may be very rare occasions when they must, or may, act without advice or even against the advice of the Ministers in office.}}<br>{{cite web|last=Forsey|first=Eugene|title=''How Canadians Govern Themselves'': Canadian and American Government (pg. 2)|publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/idb/forsey/can_am_gov_02-e.asp|quote=Yes: in Canada, the head of state can, in exceptional circumstances, protect Parliament and the people against a Prime Minister and Ministers who may forget that "minister" means "servant," and may try to make themselves masters.

In accordance with [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|convention]], the monarch or Governor General, to maintain the stability of government, must appoint as prime minister the individual most likely to maintain the support of the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]]: usually the leader of the [[List of political parties in Canada|politial party]] with a majority in that house, but also when no party or coalition holds a majority (referred to as a [[minority government]] situation), or other scenarios in which the Governor General's judgement about the most suitable candidate for prime minister has to be brought into play.<ref name="GG">[http://www.gg.ca/media/fs-fd/P1_e.asp Governor General of Canada: The Swearing in of a new Ministry]</ref> The Governor General also appointes to Cabinet the other [[Minister of the Crown|ministers of the Crown]], who are, in turn, accountable to the democratically elected House of Commons, and through it, to the people.

Members of various executive agencies, and other officials are appointed by the Crown. The commissioning of [[Lieutenant-Governor (Canada)|lieutenant governors]], [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada|privy councillors]], [[Canadian Senate|senators]], the Speaker of the Senate, [[Supreme Court of Canada|Supreme Court]] justices, and [[Superior court|Superior]] and County Court judges in each province also falls under the Royal Prerogative, though these duties are specifically assigned to the Governor General by the [[Constitution Act, 1867]], save for the appointment of judges to the Courts of Probate in [[Nova Scotia]] and [[New Brunswick]]. The lieutenant governors are also specifically delegated to appoint under the Great Seal of the Province, the Attorney General, the Secretary and Registrar of the Province, the Treasurer of the Province, the Commissioner of [[Crown land|Crown Lands]], and the Commissioner of Agriculture and Public Works, and, in the Case of Quebec, the Solicitor General. [[Public inquiries]] are also commissioned by the Crown through a [[Royal Warrant]], at the direction of either the federal or provincial cabinets, and are called [[List of Canadian Royal Commissions|Royal Commission]]s.

====Foreign affairs====
[[Image:Canadian Passport Cover.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The cover of a Canadian passport, bearing the [[Coat of arms of Canada|Royal Arms of Canada]].]]
The Royal Prerogative also extends to foreign affairs: the sovereign or Governor General negotiates and ratifies treaties, alliances, and international agreements. As with other uses of the Royal Prerogative, no parliamentary approval is required; however, a treaty cannot alter the domestic laws of Canada; an Act of Parliament is necessary in such cases. The Governor General, on behalf of the Queen, also accredits Canadian [[High Commissioner]]s and ambassadors, and receives diplomats from foreign states. These tasks were solely in the domain of the sovereign until 1977, when, at the direction of Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]], Queen Elizabeth II agreed to allow the Governor General to perform these duties on her behalf,<ref name="CMN23">[http://www.monarchist.ca/cmn/2005/Spring_2005_CMN.pdf Ed.; ''Canadian Monarchist News'': Martin Government Removes Queen From Diplomatic Documents; Spring 2005; No. 23; pg. 2]</ref> and in 2005 the [[Letter of credence|Letters of Credence and Recall]] were altered so as to run in the name of the incumbent governor general, instead of following the usual international process of the letters being from one head of state to another.<ref name="CMN23" /> In addition, the issuance of passports falls under the Royal Prerogative,<ref name="CPO">[http://www.pptc.gc.ca/publications/pdfs/81-86_administrative_2006_eng.pdf Canadian Passport Order; Registration SI/2006-95; June 28, 2006; ''Canada Gazette''; Part II, Vol. 140, No. 13]</ref> and, as such, all Canadian [[passport]]s are issued in the monarch's name.

===Parliament===
The sovereign, along with the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] and the House of Commons, is one of the three components of [[Parliament of Canada|parliament]]. The authority of the Crown in parliament is embodied in the mace for each house, which both bear a crown at their apex. The monarch and viceroy do not, however, participate in the legislative process save for the granting of Royal Assent. Further, the Constitution Act, 1867, outlines that the Governor General alone is responsible for summoning the House of Commons, though it remains the monarch's prerogative to [[prorogation|prorogue]], and [[dissolution of Parliament|dissolve]] parliament, after which the [[Writ of election|writs for a general election]] are usually [[Dropping the writ|dropped by the Governor General]] at [[Rideau Hall]]. The new parliamentary session is marked by the [[State Opening of Parliament]], during which either the monarch or the Governor General reads the [[Speech from the Throne]]. As the monarch and viceroy cannot enter the House of Commons, this, as well as the bestowing of Royal Assent, takes place in the Senate chamber; Members of Parliament are summoned to these ceremonies from the Commons by the Crown's messenger, the [[Black Rod|Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod]], after he knocks on the doors of the lower house that have been slammed closed on him, to symbolise the barring of the monarch from the Commons.<ref>[http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Parlinfo/compilations/OfficersAndOfficials/ProceduralOfficersAndSeniorOfficials_Senate.aspx Parliament of Canada: Officers and Officials of Parliament]</ref>

===Provinces===
{{Main|Monarchy in the Canadian provinces}}
[[Image:May23 14-QE-Alb.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The three main bodies of the [[Government of Alberta|provincial government of Alberta]]: The [[Queen of Canada]] (centre) with her vice-regal representative, the [[Lieutenant Governor of Alberta]], [[Norman Kwong]] (left), and her [[Premier of Alberta|Albertan premier]], [[Ralph Klein]] (right), at the official celebrations of [[Alberta]]'s centennary, [[May 23]], [[2005]].]]

The Canadian monarchy is a [[Federal monarchy|federal one]] in which the Crown is unitary across the country, with the [[Head of State|headship of state]] being a part of neither the federal nor provincial jurisdictions, meaning the [[sovereignty]] of the provinces is passed on not by the Governor General or the [[Parliament of Canada|Canadian parliament]], but through the Crown itself. This means that, though unitary, the Crown is "divided" into eleven legal jurisdictions; into eleven "crowns"{{ndash}} one federal and ten provincial.<ref>[http://www.monarchist.ca/cmnews/CMN_winter_spring_2003_Update-3.pdf Jackson, Michael; ''Canadian Monarchist News'': Golden Jubilee and Provincial Crown; Spring, 2003]</ref>  The [[:Category:Fathers of Confederation|Fathers of Confederation]] viewed this system of constitutional monarchy as a bulkwark against any potential fracturing of the [[Canadian confederation|Canadian federation]].<ref>Smith; p. 8</ref>

A [[Lieutenant-Governor (Canada)|Lieutenant Governor]] serves as the Queen's representative in each province, carrying out all the monarch's constitutional and ceremonial duties of state on her behalf. The [[Commissioner]]s of Canada's territories of [[Nunavut]], [[Yukon]], and [[Northwest Territories]] are appointed by the [[Queen-in-Council|Governor-in-Council]], at the recommendation of the federal [[Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (Canada)|Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development]], but, as the territories are not sovereign entities, the commissioners are not representatives of the sovereign.

==Legal role==
===Legislation===
All laws in Canada are enacted only with the viceroy's, or sovereign's, granting of [[Royal Assent]]; usually done by the Governor General or relevant Lieutenant Governor, with the [[Great Seal of Canada]] or the appropriate provincial seal. Thus, all federal bills begin with the phrase "Now, therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows,"<ref>[http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Docid=2604319&file=4 Bill C43: ''An Act to provide for consultations with electors on their preferences for appointments to the Senate'']</ref> There is some debate over whether the monarch is constitutionally allowed to personally grant Royal Assent to provincial bills,<ref>[http://www.monarchist.ca/cmn/2005/AutumnWinter_2005_CMN.pdf Munro, Kenneth and Toporoski, Richard; ''Canadian Monarchist News'': Can the Queen Give Royal Assent in a Provincial Legislature?; Fall/Winter 2005; pg. 17]</ref> however, he or she can do so for the federal parliament (as [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]] did in 1939), and the Governor General may defer Royal Assent to the sovereign. A Lieutenant Governor of a province may similarly defer to the Governor General, who may in turn defer to the monarch, who has the power to disallow any bill, within a time limit specified by the constitution. Recently, activists opposed to [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|Bill C-38]] lobbied Queen Elizabeth II to disallow the legislation after it was passed by parliament. However, it received Royal Assent from [[Beverley McLachlin]], then Deputy of the Governor General, on [[July 20]], [[2005]]. Territorial legislatures, unlike their provincial counterparts, are subject to the oversight of the Government of Canada.<ref>[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/N-27/252179.html Department of Justice Canada: ''Northwest Territories Act''; 1985]</ref><ref>[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/Y-2.01/265655.html Department of Justice Canada: ''Yukon Act''; 2000]</ref><ref>[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/N-28.6/index.html Department of Justice Canada: ''Nunavut Act''; 1993]</ref>
[[Image:Armoiries du Canada.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Coat of arms of Canada|Royal Arms of Canada]] displayed outside a courthouse in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]].]]

===Courts===
The sovereign is deemed the ''fount of justice'', and is responsible for rendering justice for all subjects. However, he or she does not personally rule in judicial cases; instead, judicial functions are performed in his or her name. Hence, the common law holds that the sovereign "can do no wrong"; the monarch cannot be prosecuted in his or her own courts for criminal offences. Civil lawsuits against the Crown in its public capacity (that is, lawsuits against the government) are permitted; however, lawsuits against the monarch personally are not cognizable. In international cases, as a [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] and under established principles of [[international law]], the Queen of Canada is not subject to suit in foreign courts without her express consent.<ref name="US" /> The sovereign, and by extension the Governor General, also exercises the ''[[Pardon#Pardons and clemency in Canada|prerogative of mercy]]'', and may pardon offences against the Crown, either before, during, or after a trial.

In addition, the monarch also serves as a symbol of the legitimacy of courts of justice, and of their judicial authority. An image of the Queen or the [[Coat of Arms of Canada|Arms of Her Majesty in Right of Canada]] is always displayed in Canadian courtrooms; exceptions are the courts of [[British Columbia]], the [[Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador]], and some of the courts of Ontario, where the [[Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom|Arms of Her Majesty in Right of the United Kingdom]] are displayed as a symbol of the judiciary.<ref>[http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/index.asp Courts of British Columbia]</ref><ref>[http://www.court.nl.ca/supreme/default.htm Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador - Home<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Itinerant]] judges will display an image of the Queen and the [[Flag of Canada|Canadian flag]] when holding a session away from established courtrooms; such situations occur in parts of Canada where the stakeholders in a given court case are too isolated geographically to be able to travel for regular proceedings.

===Legal embodiment of the state===
In Canada the legal personality of the [[state]] is referred to as ''Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada'' (French: ''Sa Majesté la Reine du chef du Canada''), and likewise for the provinces and territories (i.e., ''in Right of Ontario'', etc.).<ref>[http://arizonaenergy.org/images/ontario_mou_e.pdf ''Memorandum for Understanding of Cooperation on Addressing Climate Change''; May 21, 2004]</ref> For example, if a lawsuit is filed against the federal government, the respondent is formally described as Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, or simply ''[[Queen regnant|Regina]]''.<ref name="CRHT2" /> Likewise, in a case in which a party sues both the province of [[Saskatchewan]] and the federal government, the respondents would formally be called Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Saskatchewan and Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.<ref>[http://www.usask.ca/nativelaw/factums/claim.html Lac La Ronge Indian Band vs. Her Majesty the Queen In Right of Canada, and Her Majesty the Queen in Right of the Province of Saskatchewan; Q. B. No. 2655 of 1987]</ref>

As such, the monarch is the owner of all state lands, buildings, and equipment{{ndash}} called ''[[Crown land]]'' and ''Crown held property'',<ref>[http://www.forces.gc.ca/dgcb/dcba/mfs/engraph/crown_held_automobiles_04_e.asp National Defence: Crown held automobiles]</ref> as well as all [[Crown copyright]], either as Queen in Right of Canada or of a relevant province<ref>[http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/reference/national/can_political_e/map.pdf Natural Resources Canada: Map of Canada]</ref>{{ndash}} though only in his or her position as sovereign, and not as an individual. Government staff are also employed by the monarch; the [[Supreme Court of Canada|Supreme Court]] found in the 1980 case Attorney General of Quebec v. Labrecque that [[Civil service|civil servants]] in Canada are not contracted by an abstraction called "the [[state]]," but rather they are employed by the monarch, who "enjoys a general capacity to contract in accordance with the rule of ordinary law."<ref>Smith; p. 79</ref> This situation is similar for the governors, judges, members of the [[Canadian Forces]], [[police]] officers, and [[Parliament of Canada|parliamentarians]], who all technically work for the monarch. In this role, the monarch is the locus of [[Oath of Allegiance (Canada)|oaths of allegiance]]; it states in the ''Rules & Forms of the House of Commons of Canada'' that "allegiance to the King means allegiance to the Country."<ref>Beauchesne, Arthur; ''Rules & Forms of the House of Commons of Canada''; Fourth Edition; The Carswell Company Limited; Toronto; 1958; p. 14</ref> Hence, many employees of the Crown are required by law to recite the [[Oath of Allegiance (Canada)|Oath of Allegiance]] before taking their posts, though the 2003 Public Services Modernization Act ended the requirement of civil servants to swear allegiance to the Queen. Also, by the [[Canadian nationality law|Citizenship Act]], new [[citizenship|citizens]] also must swear allegiance to the monarch in the [[Oath of citizenship (Canada)|Oath of Citizenship]], in [[Reciprocal|reciprocation]] to the sovereign's [[Coronation]] Oath, wherein he or she promises "to govern the Peoples of&nbsp;... Canada&nbsp;... according to their respective laws and customs".<ref>[http://www.oremus.org/liturgy/coronation/cor1953b.html The Form and Order of Service that is to be performed and the Ceremonies that are to be observed in the Coronation of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in the Abbey Church of St. Peter, Westminster, on Tuesday, the second day of June, 1953]</ref>

Past Ontario chairman of the [[Monarchist League of Canada]] Gary Toffoli stated: "The Queen is the legal embodiment of the state at both the national and the provincial levels. There is no other legal embodiment. That is why the oath is taken to the Queen. It is not taken because she is an admirable person in her own right or because it is a nice tradition to maintain. It is taken to the Queen because she is our sovereign and it is the role of the Queen, recognized by the constitutional law of Canada, to embody the state."<ref>[http://www.ontla.on.ca/web/committee-proceedings/committee_transcripts_details.do;jsessionid=c72d607930d600b4e9b4ead54d5496d1d6b94ab16cbc.e3eRb3iNcheNe34OaN4La3yRa3j0n6jAmljGr5XDqQLvpAe?locale=en&Date=1996-04-10&ParlCommID=45&BillID=&Business=Bill+22%2C+Legislative+Assembly+Oath+of+Allegiance+Act%2C+1995#P58_3463 Committee Transcripts: Standing Committee on the Legislative Assembly - April 10, 1996 - Bill 22, Legislative Assembly Oath of Allegiance Act, 1995]</ref>

==Cultural role==
===Representing the state===
{{rquote|right|''The Canadian Crown continues as a key element of our parliamentary democracy and an enduring symbol that represents all generations of Canadians and the best that is our country.''<ref>[http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/special/royalvisit2005/53_e.cfm Canadian Heritage: 2005 Royal Visit: The Queen and Canada: 53 Years of Growing Together]</ref>|<small>[[Department of Canadian Heritage]], 2005</small>}}

Prior to the reign of [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]], when Canadians were still, both by law and personal view, [[British subject]]s, the monarchy was viewed as a predominantly or purely British institution. However, paralleling the changes in constitutional law and the evolution of [[Canadian nationalism]], the cultural role of the monarchy in Canada altered. Since that time, the federal and provincial governments have recognized and promoted the sovereign's role as monarch of Canada as separate to his or her position as monarch of the United Kingdom.<ref>[http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/about/people/senate//Monarchy/SenMonarchy_15-e.htm Canada: a Constitutional Monarchy]</ref><ref>[http://canada.gc.ca/howgoc/queen/quind_e.html Biography: Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II Queen of Canada]</ref><ref>[http://www.gr.gov.sk.ca/protocol/Practice/crown_in_canada.htm Saskatchewan Government Relations: The Crown in Canada]</ref> The first shifts were seen during the 1939 royal tour of King George VI and Queen [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Elizabeth]], when Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] desired that the King perform duties specifically as King of Canada, and travel to the [[United States]] in the same capacity.<ref name="Lanctot" /> and [[John Diefenbaker]] directed Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] to do the same in order to demonstrate Canada's sovereignty from the United Kingdom. Also, from the beginning of Elizabeth's reign onwards, royal symbols in Canada were altered or new ones created to make them distinctly Canadian, such as the [[Queen's Personal Canadian Flag|sovereign's Canadian royal standard]], instituted in 1962,<ref>Franco, Guida; ''Canadian Almanac & Directory 2006''; Toronto: Micromedia ProQuest; 2006; p. 3. ISBN 1-895021-90-1.</ref> and the augmentation of the [[Coat of Arms of Canada|Royal Arms of Canada]] in 1994.<ref name="RHSC">[http://www.heraldry.ca/misc/coatArmsCanada.htm Royal Heraldry Society of Canada: The Coat of Arms]</ref>

Today the sovereign is regarded as the personification of the Canadian [[state]], described by the [[Department of Canadian Heritage]] as the "personal symbol of allegiance, unity and authority for all Canadians,"<ref name="Heritage" /><ref name="Buck2">[http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page5179.asp Buckingham Palace: The Queen and Commonwealth: Canada: The Queen's role in Canada]</ref> a concept akin to that expressed in the statement by King [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]: "''l'État, c'est moi''", or, "I am the state."<ref>[http://www.ontla.on.ca/web/committee-proceedings/committee_transcripts_details.do;jsessionid=c72d607930d600b4e9b4ead54d5496d1d6b94ab16cbc.e3eRb3iNcheNe34OaN4La3yRa3j0n6jAmljGr5XDqQLvpAe?locale=en&Date=1996-04-10&ParlCommID=45&BillID=&Business=Bill+22%2C+Legislative+Assembly+Oath+of+Allegiance+Act%2C+1995#P58_3463 Committee Transcripts: Standing Committee on the Legislative Assembly - April 10, 1996 - Bill 22, Legislative Assembly Oath of Allegiance Act, 1995]</ref> Elizabeth II said in 1973: "But it is as Queen of Canada that I am here, Queen of Canada and of all Canadians, not just of one or two ancestral strains. I want the Crown to be seen as a symbol of national sovereignty belonging to all. It is not only a link between Commonwealth nations, but between Canadian citizens of every national origin and ancestry."

===Royal presence and duties===
[[Image:Prince of Wales at the official opening of Union Station.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward, Prince of Wales]], arrives to open [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]] in [[Toronto]], [[1927]].]] 
Members of the Royal Family have been present in Canada since the late [[1700s]], either on military maneuvers, for official tours, or as the vice-regal representative of the British, and later Canadian monarch. Today, though the monarch and the rest of the Royal Family live predominantly in the United Kingdom, members visit regularly enough that, on occasion, [[royal tours of Canada]] are also referred to by [[Monarchism in Canada|monarchists]] as ''Royal Homecomings''. Usually important milestones, anniversaries, or celebrations of [[Culture of Canada|Canadian culture]] will warrant the presence of the monarch, while other royals will be asked to participate in lesser occasions. In these instances, when acting at the direction of the [[Cabinet of Canada|Canadian Cabinet]], they are doing so as monarch of Canada and members of the [[#Canadian Royal Family|Canadian Royal Family]],<ref>[http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page4918.asp Buckingham Palace: The Monarchy Today: Canada]</ref> respectively, and will carry out two types of duties:

''Official duties'' involve the sovereign representing the [[state]] at home or abroad, or other Royal Family members participating in a government organised ceremony either in Canada or elsewhere.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/story/canada/national/2005/05/17/royal-visit-050517.html CBC News: ''Queen arrives in Saskatchewan''; May 18, 2005]</ref><ref>[http://www.royal.gov.uk/OutPut/Page4120.asp ''Royal Insight Magazine'': The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh pay a centenary visit to Canada, 17-24 May 2005]</ref><ref>[http://www.pch.gc.ca/royalvisit2005/day09_e.cfm Department of Canadian Heritage: The 2005 Royal Visit - Day 9]</ref><ref>[http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page4384.asp#2.5 Buckingham Palace: Guidelines and Procedures for the Acceptance, Classification, Retention and Disposal of Gifts to Members of the Royal Family]</ref><ref name="MJ">[http://www.monarchist.ca/cmn/2004/Sum04PDFPRinSask.pdf Jackson, Michael; ''Canadian Monarchist News'': The "Working" Princess: Saskatchewan Welcomes the Princess Royal; Summer, 2004]</ref> The monarch and/or his or her family have been involved in events such as various centennials and bicentennials; [[Canada Day]]; the openings of [[Pan American Games|Pan American]], [[Olympic Games|Olympic]], and other games; anniversaries of [[First Nations]] [[Numbered Treaties|treaty]] signings; award ceremonies; [[D-Day]] commemorations; anniversaries of the monarch's accession; and the like. Also, though the sovereign and his or her family more frequently represent the UK abroad, as directed by the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|British Cabinet]], and typically the Governor General, as representative of the monarch, will undertake [[state visit]]s and other foreign duties on behalf of Canada,<ref>[http://www.gg.ca/osgg-bsgg/fin/2004-05/fs-2005-03_e.asp Governor General of Canada: Report on Performance]</ref><ref>[http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/decret-executif/023004-2020-e.html Library and Archives Canada: By Executive Decree: The Governor General]</ref> the Royal Family will take part in Canadian events overseas; for instance, King [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]] dedicated the [[Canadian National Vimy Memorial]] in [[France]];<ref>Foot, Richard; ''The Vancouver Sun'': Vimy memorial had a turbulent history of its own; [[April 4]], [[2007]]; p.A4</ref> [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]] and [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|his wife]] visited the [[United States]] as King and Queen of Canada;<ref name="Lanctot">According to the official Royal Tour historian [[Gustave Lanctot]], George VI was to be present in [[Canada]] as a living example the fact of Canada's status as an independent kingdom.

Along with the Acting Canadian Secretary to the Queen,<ref name="Hansard62" /> the monarch's entourage includes the Queen's Honorary Physician, the Queen's Honorary Dental Surgeon, and the Queen's Honorary Nursing Sister, the latter being drawn from the [[Canadian Forces]].<ref name="CRHT2">[http://www.crht.ca/DiscoverMonarchyFiles/FactsAboutMonarchy.html Bousfield, Arthur and Toffoli, Garry; The Canadian Royal Heritage Trust: Facts About Canada's Monarchy]</ref>

''Unofficial duties'' are performed by Royal Family members on behalf of Canadian organizations of which they may be [[Patronage|patrons]], through their attendance at charity events, visiting with members of the [[Canadian Forces]] as [[Colonel-in-Chief]], or marking certain key anniversaries.<ref name="MJ" /> The invitation and expenses associated with these undertakings are usually borne by the associated organization. In 2002 members of the Royal Family were present at a total of 117 Canadian engagements, 57 events in 2003, 19 in 2004, and 76 in 2005.

Apart from Canada, the Queen and other members of the Royal Family regularly perform public duties in the other fifteen nations of the Commonwealth in which the Queen is head of state. As the Crown within these countries is a legally separate entity from the Canadian Crown, it is funded in these countries individually, through the ordinary legislative budgeting process. This situation, however, can mean the monarch and/or members of the Royal Family will be promoting one nation and not another; a situation that has been met with criticism.<ref>Former External Affairs Minister [[Mitchell Sharp]] commented on a situation wherein Elizabeth II was in Latin America to promote British goods at the same time a Canadian ministerial trip to the same area was underway to promote Canadian products. Sharp stated: "We couldn't ask Her Majesty to perform the function she was performing for Britain on that Latin American trip because the Queen is never recognized as Queen of Canada, except when she is in Canada". Sharp, Mitchell; ''Which Reminds Me..., A Memoir''; Toronto: University of Toronto Press; 1994; p. 223</ref>

The main symbol of the monarchy is the sovereign herself, described as "the personal expression of the Crown in Canada."<ref>MacKinnon, Frank; ''The Crown in Canada''; Glenbow-Alberta Institute; 1976; p. 69</ref> Thus, her image appears on [[Canadian dollar|currency]], and in portraits in public buildings, and she is mentioned in, and the subject of, songs, toasts, and salutes.<ref>[http://www.saskd.ca/heritage.pdf Department of National Defence: The Honours, Flags and Heritage Structure of the Canadian Forces; pg. 404]</ref><ref>[http://www.saskd.ca/heritage.pdf Department of National Defence: The Honours, Flags and Heritage Structure of the Canadian Forces; pg. 449-450]</ref> A crown is also used to illustrate the monarchy as the locus of authority, appearing on [[Orders, decorations, and medals of Canada|decorations and honours]], provincial and [[Coat of Arms of Canada|national coats of arms]], and [[police]] force and [[Canadian Forces]] regimental and maritime badges and rank insignia.

[[Victoria Day]] marks the reigning sovereign's official birthday in Canada.<ref>[http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/jfa-ha/victoria_e.cfm Heritage Canada: Victoria Day]</ref> and there are hundreds of places named for Canadian monarchs and members of the Royal Family all across Canada; no individual has been more honoured in this way than Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]].<ref>[http://www.canadianencyclopedia.ca/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0008358 ''The Canadian Encyclopedia'':Victoria]</ref> There also exist hundreds of statues of, and monuments to, Canada's monarchs, usually on the grounds of government buildings or in large public parks. As well, the Royal Swans live in Ottawa; of two varieties (the [[Mute Swan]], and [[Black Swan]]),<ref>[http://www.ottawahumane.ca/swan.html#1 Ottawa Humane Society: Royal Swan FAQ]</ref> the original six pairs of birds were a gift to the city from Queen Elizabeth II in 1967, to commemorate the Canadian Centennial.

==History==
{{main|History of monarchy in Canada}}
[[Image:Francis1-1.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Francis I of France]]; established colonies in [[Acadia]] and Canada, 1534.]]
Though the first French and British colonizers of Canada interpreted the hereditary nature of some indigenous [[North America]]n chieftainships as a form of monarchy, it is generally accepted that Canada has been the territory of a monarch, or a monarchy in its own right, only since the establishment of [[New France]].<ref>[http://www.angelfire.com/mi4/polcrt/4Chiefs.html The Four Indian Kings]</ref><ref>[http://www.carsten-rex.de/History/history.html Canada: History]</ref><ref>[http://www.macleans.ca/switchboard/article.jsp?content=20031027_68038_68038 Ferguson, Will; ''The Lost Kingdom''; ''Macleans'', October 27, 2003]</ref> Thus, [[History of monarchy in Canada#Monarchs of Canadian territories|kings and queens reigning over Canada]] have included the [[List of French monarchs|monarchs of France]] (from [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] to [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]), [[List of British monarchs|those of the UK]] (from [[Anne of Great Britain|Anne]] to [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]]), to the monarchs of Canada, from [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] to [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] as [[Style of the Canadian sovereign|Queen of Canada]] today.

The lands of the French Crown were merged with the [[North America]]n colonies of the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British Crown]] through the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in [[1763]], and, in 1867, with the granting of [[Royal Assent]] by Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]] to the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act]], Canada became a self-governing [[Dominion]], intended by the main [[Canadian Confederation#Fathers of Confederation|Father of Confederation]], [[John A. Macdonald]], to be named the ''[[Canada's name#Adoption of Dominion|Kingdom of Canada]]''. From that date to the [[patriation]] of the Canadian constitution in 1982, Canada developed into a kingdom in its own right,<ref>[http://www.pch.gc.ca/special/royalvisit/ENGLISH.pdf Department of Canadian Heritage: ''The Crown in Canada'']</ref> notably through the issuance of the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]], the [[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act, 1927]], and the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster, 1931]]. The [[Constitution Act, 1982]], is said to have entrenched the monarchy in Canada, due to the stringent requirements, as laid out in the amending formula, that must be met to alter the monarchy in any way.

The emergence of a distinct monarchy for Canada was demonstrated in the abdication of [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VIII]] in 1936{{ndash}} when Canada had to pass its own [[Succession to the Throne Act]], which effected changes to the rules of succession in Canada so that they matched those within the other realms of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]]<ref>[http://www.canlii.org/on/cas/onsc/2003/2003onsc11019.html O'Donohue v. Her Majesty The Queen in Right of Canada]</ref>{{ndash}} as well as when King [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]] and Queen [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Elizabeth]] travelled from Canada into the [[United States]] as [[Style of the Canadian sovereign|King and Queen of Canada]].<ref>[http://www.collectionscanada.ca/05/0532/053201/053201130206_e.html The Royal Tour of 1939]</ref> As ease of travel increased, visits by the sovereign and other Royal Family members became more and more frequent, seeing the Queen Elizabeth II officiate at such important moments as the opening of the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] in [[1959 in Canada|1959]]; the [[Canadian Centennial]] in [[1967 in Canada|1967]]; the opening of the [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Olympics]] in [[Montreal]]; the [[patriation]] of the Constitution in [[1982 in Canada|1982]], the 500th anniversary, in [[1997 in Canada|1997]], of [[John Cabot|Cabot's]] landing at [[Bonavista, Newfoundland and Labrador|Bonavista]]; and more.

Through the 1960s and 1970s, the rise of [[Quebec nationalism]] and changes in [[Canadian identity]] created an atmosphere where the purpose and role of the monarchy [[Debate on the monarchy in Canada|came into question]]. Some references to the monarch and the monarchy were removed from the public eye, and moves were made by the federal government to constitutionally alter the Crown's place and role in Canada; but, provincial and federal ministers, along with loyal [[Monarchism in Canada|national citizen's organisations]], ensured that the system remained essentially the same.<ref>[http://www.monarchist.ca/cmnews/Sum04PDFRepublicanism.pdf#search='quebec%20monarchy' Dr. Stephen Phillips; Republicanism in Canada in the reign of Elizabeth II: the dog that didn't bark]</ref> Still, by 2002, the year of ''[[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II#Canada|The Queen's Golden Jubilee: a Canadian Celebration]]'',<ref>[http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/special/jubilee/e-general-info.htm Department of Canadian Heritage; Golden Jubilee: a Canadian Celebration; General Information]</ref> it was revealed in a poll that only 5% of Canadians were aware that the monarch was their [[head of state]],<ref>[http://www.ekos.com/admin/articles/31may2001.pdf Ekos; ''Trust and the Monarchy: an examination of the shifting public attitudes towards government and institutions; May 30, 2002]</ref> though the the royal tour and associated [[fête]]s for the jubilee proved popular with Canadians.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/story/news/national/2002/10/06/queen_hockey021006.html CBC News: ''Queen drops puck, raises cheer in arena'']</ref><ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/story/news/national/2002/10/10/queencbc021010.html CBC News: ''Queen helps CBC TV mark 50th anniversary'']</ref><ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/story/news/national/2002/10/11/queen_friday021011.html CBC News: ''Queen begins visit to New Brunswick'']</ref>

== Canadian Royal Family ==
{{dablink|The Canadian Royal Family is shared between the [[Commonwealth realm]]s; this article focuses on the perspective of [[Canada]].  For information on the Royal Family in the other realms, see [[#Other realms: royal family|Other realms: Royal Family]].}}
[[Image:Roy-fam-canada.jpg|thumb|right|260px|The Canadian Royal Family gathers in [[Lac-Brome, Quebec]], 1976 (left to right: the [[Duke of Edinburgh]], [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]] (now [[Princess Royal]]), [[Mark Phillips]], [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Prince Edward]] (now [[Earl of Wessex]]), the Queen, [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Prince Andrew]] (now [[Duke of York]]) and [[Charles, Prince of Wales]]. ]]

The '''Canadian Royal Family''' is a group of people closely related to the monarch of Canada;<ref>[http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/ps/nap/comm/deaw_e.html#hon Ministry of Indian and Northern Affairs: Commissionners of the Territories: Honours of Office]</ref> it is a non-resident royal family, as those who comprise the group live predominantly in the [[United Kingdom]]; some members have lived in Canada for extended periods as [[viceroy]], such as [[Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone]]. Members often perform ceremonial and social duties but, aside from the monarch, have no role in the affairs of government.  Those who compose the Royal Family carry the [[style (manner of address)|style]] ''[[Majesty|His or Her Majesty]]'' (HM), ''[[Royal Highness|His or Her Royal Highness]]'' (HRH), or sometimes ''[[The Right Honourable]]'' (in [[French language|French]]: ''Sa Majesté'' (SM), ''Son Altesse Royale'' (SAR), and ''Le très honorable''), which usually results in the application of the term to the monarch, the [[List of Canadian monarchs#List of Royal Consorts of Canada|consort of the monarch]], the widowed consorts of previous monarchs, the children of the monarch, the male-line grandchildren of the monarch, and the spouses and the widowed spouses of a monarch's son and male-line grandsons.

It has been stated by the [http://www.crht.ca/ Canadian Royal Heritage Trust] that [[Prince Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent and Strathearn|Prince Edward, Duke of Kent]], due to his having lived in Canada between 1791 and 1800, and his being father of Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]], is "the ancestor of the modern Canadian Royal Family".<ref>[http://www.crht.ca/DiscoverMonarchyFiles/ArmedForces.html Toffoli, Gary; ''The Royal Family and the Armed Forces''; Canadian Royal Heritage Trust]</ref>  However, the concept of the Canadian Royal Family did not emerge until after the passage of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] in 1931. Though the act came into effect during the reign of King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]], Canadian officials only began to overtly consider putting the principles of Canada's new status as an independent [[Monarchy|kingdom]] into effect during the late 1930s.<ref name="Parl">[http://www.parl.gc.ca/Infoparl/english/issue.htm?param=130&art=820 Galbraith, William; ''Canadian Parliamentary Review'': Fiftieth Anniversary of the 1939 Royal Visit; Vol. 12, No. 3, 1989]</ref> At first, the monarch was the only member of the Royal Family to carry out public ceremonial duties solely on the advice of Canadian ministers; King [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]] became the first to do so when he dedicated the [[Canadian National Vimy Memorial|Vimy Memorial]] in July, [[1936]]{{ndash}} one of his few obligations performed during his short reign.<ref>[http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=memorials/ww1mem/vimy/battle&CFID=14831976&CFTOKEN=67789669 Veterans Affairs Canada: VAC Canada Remembers: The Battle of Vimy Ridge - Fast Facts]</ref> Over the decades, however, the monarch's children, grandchildren, cousins, and their respective [[spouse]]s began to perform functions at the direction of the Canadian government, representing the monarch within Canada or abroad.

Despite the length of service, it was not until October 2002, when the term ''Canadian Royal Family'' was first used publicly and officially by a member of it: in a speech given to the [[Legislative Assembly of Nunavut|Nunavut legislature]] at its opening, Queen Elizabeth II stated: "I am proud to be the first member of the Canadian Royal Family to be greeted in Canada's newest territory".<ref>[http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page4178.asp Text of The Queen's address to the Legislative Assembly in Nunavut, Canada, 4 October 2002]</ref>  Still, the Canadian media often still refer to the Royal Family as the ''British Royal Family''.<ref>[http://www.thestar.com/artsentertainment/article/163172Howell, Peter; ''Toronto Star'': Queen rules for city critics; December 20, 2006]</ref><ref>[http://www.canoe.ca/NewsStand/WinnipegSun/News/2005/04/11/991413-sun.html Canadian Press; Winnipeg Sun: Royal wedding details emerge; April 11, 2005]</ref>

===Composition===
[[Image:Roy-fam-2007.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Members of the Canadian Royal Family gathered for a dinner celebrating the 60th wedding anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh.]]
Queen Elizabeth II is the head of the Royal Family; her family is considered Canada's Royal Family.<ref>[http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/ps/nap/comm/deaw_e.html#hon Ministry of Indian and Northern Affairs: Commissionners of the Territories: Honours of Office]</ref> Those in the direct line of succession owe their allegiance to Elizabeth II specifically as the Queen of Canada,<ref name="Noonan">Noonan, Peter C.; ''The Crown and Constitutional Law in Canada''; Sripnoon Publications, Calgary; 1998</ref> and, according to the [[Department of National Defence and the Canadian Forces|Department of National Defence]], members of the family who bear the style ''Royal Highness'' are subjects specifically of the Canadian monarch,<ref>[http://www.saskd.ca/heritage.pdf Department of National Defence: ''The Honours, Flags and Heritage Structure of the Canadian Forces''; pg 281]</ref>  They are entitled to [[Diplomatic missions of Canada|Canadian consular assistance]] and to the protection of the Queen's [[Canadian Forces|armed forces of Canada]] when they are outside of the [[Commonwealth realm]]s, and in need of protection or aid.<ref name="Noonan" /> Their position as subjects but not citizens of Canada is reflected in the confusion that arises around the awarding of honours to members of the Royal Family; for example, the [[Order of Canada]] bestowed upon [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|the Queen Mother]] was only honorary, though the [[Canadian Forces Decoration]] awarded to her was not.<ref>[http://www.monarchist.ca/cmn/celebrations.htm Queen Mother appointed to Order of Canada]</ref><ref>[http://pch.gc.ca/newsroom/index_e.cfm?fuseaction=displayDocument&DocIDCd=2N0018 Commemoration Service for Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother,C.C.]</ref>

Although there is no strict legal or formal definition of who is or is not a member of the Royal Family<ref>[http://www.heraldica.org/faqs/britfaq.html#p2-2 Heraldica: FAQ]</ref>{{ndash}} a royal family is loosely defined as the extended family of a [[Monarchy|monarch]]{{ndash}} according to former [[Minister of Canadian Heritage and Status of Women|Minister of Canadian Heritage]] [[Sheila Copps]], the Canadian federal government does maintain an official list of Royal Family members for matters of honours and protocol.<ref name="Copps" />  Because of the [[Commonwealth Realm#Nature of the Crown|shared nature of the Crown]], most members of the Canadian Royal Family are also members of the [[British Royal Family]], and are thus also members of the [[House of Windsor]]. There are some exceptions, however; for instance [[Angus Ogilvy]] was included in the [[Department of Canadian Heritage]]'s Royal Family list,<ref>[http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/fr-rf/_00_e.cfm Department of Canadian Heritage: Royal Family]</ref> whereas he was not considered a member of the British Royal Family.

There have been two marriages of Canadian citizens into the extended royal family. In 1988, [[Sylvana Jones]] (neé Tomaselli) married [[George Windsor, Earl of St Andrews]], a great-grandson of [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]].  On [[May 18]], [[2008]], [[Autumn Phillips|Autumn Kelly]], originally from Montreal, married [[Peter Phillips]].<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2008/05/17/royal-wedding.html CBC News:  Montrealer Autumn Kelly weds Queen's eldest grandson; May 17, 2008]</ref>
Phillips is the son of [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]], and the eldest grandchild of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]. Divorced spouses of the monarch's descendants are removed from the official government list of Royal Family members, as was the case with [[Diana, Princess of Wales]].<ref name="Copps">[http://www.torontosun.com/News/Columnists/Copps_Sheila/2006/04/26/1550711.html Copps, Sheila; ''Toronto Sun: PM should ignore flag bureaucrats'']; [[April 26]], [[2006]]</ref>

Canadian poet [[George Elliott Clarke]] has publicly opined on a fully [[First Nations]] royal family, asking "why can't a truly Canadian royal family be Aboriginal or [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]]? I think the project&nbsp;... would do wonders for national identity and national unity".<ref>[http://www.uofaweb.ualberta.ca/senate/news.cfm?story=36105 Lingley, Scott; University of Alberta Senate: ''Clarke calls on grads to help achieve the ideals of Canada''; June 7, 2005]</ref> However, this would contravene the convention laid out in the preamble to the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] (a part of the Canadian Constitution).

The existence of a Canadian royal family has been contested by some, mostly in the small [[Debate on the monarchy in Canada|Canadian republican movement]]. However, [[Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia]] [[Iona Campagnolo]] has also stated she feels Canada does not "really have a royal family".<ref name="McCullough" />
:''See also: [[British Royal Family#List of members|List of Members]]''

===Styles===
Unlike in the United Kingdom, in Canada the sovereign is the only member of the Royal Family who has a title established through law. Though it would be possible for other members of the Royal Family to be granted distinctly Canadian titles (as is the case for the [[Duke of Rothesay]] in [[Scotland]]), they have always been, and continue to only be accorded the use of a [[courtesy title]], which is the style they have been granted via [[Letters Patent]] in the United Kingdom.

However, in Canada these styles are also translated to [[French language|French]]. The most senior members of the Royal Family are styled as follows:
* His [[Royal Highness]] [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|The Duke of Edinburgh]]: ''Son Altesse Royale le prince Philip, duc d'Édimbourg''
* His Royal Highness [[Charles, Prince of Wales|The Prince of Wales]]: ''Son Altesse Royale le prince de Galles''
* His Royal Highness [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|The Duke of York]]: ''Son Altesse Royale le duc d'York''
* His Royal Highness [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|The Earl of Wessex]]: ''Son Altesse Royale le comte de Wessex''
* Her Royal Highness [[Sophie, The Countess of Wessex|The Countess of Wessex]]: ''Son Altesse Royale la comtesse de Wessex''
* Her Royal Highness [[Anne, Princess Royal|The Princess Royal]]: ''Son Altesse Royale la princesse Royale''

===Popularity===
The popularity of the Royal Family with Canadians, as well as individual members of it, has fluctuated over the years. Mirroring the mood in the United Kingdom, the family's lowest approval was during the mid-1980s to 1990s when the children of the monarch were enduring their [[divorce]]s, and were the targets of negative [[tabloid]] reporting. Some recent poll results follow:

* An [[EKOS Research Associates]] Poll conducted in May 2002, concluded that 35% of Canadians found the Royal Family boring, 52% saw them as interesting, with 12% stating neither. 44% said they were irrelevant, 46% said the opposite, and 8% said neither. 59% saw the Royal Family as tired, 22% deemed them vibrant, and 17% put them at neither.<ref>[http://www.ekos.com/admin/articles/31may2001.pdf EKOS: ''Trust and the Monarchy: and examination of the shifting public attitudes toward government and institutions''; May 30, 2002]</ref>
* A March 2005, [[Decima Research]] Poll found some interesting support levels for members of the Royal Family. 71% of Canadians had a favourable impression of the Royal Family. Only 20% had an unfavourable impression of the Royal Family. The poll found that 28% of Canadians saw the Queen as their favourite member of the Royal Family, [[Prince William of Wales|Prince William]] was second with 26%, [[Prince Henry of Wales|Prince Harry]] was third with 9%, Prince Charles was fourth with 6% and Prince Philip last with 2%.

==Residences==
[[Image:Rideau Hall04.JPG|thumb|right|350px|Rideau Hall, the monarch's principal Canadian residence, though foremostly that of the Governor General.]]
{{main|Government Houses of Canada}}
The sovereign's primary official residence is [[Rideau Hall]],<ref name="Parl" /><ref>Lanctot, Gustave; ''Royal Tour of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in Canada and the United States of America 1939''; E.P. Taylor Foundation; 1964</ref><ref name="Mon">[http://www.monarchist.ca/mc/palace.htm Aimers, John; ''Monarchy Canada'': The Palace on the Rideau; April 1996]</ref> in [[Ottawa]]; however, this is also, and predominantly, the official home of the Governor General.<ref name="RH">[http://www.gg.ca/rh/rh_e.asp Governor General of Canada: Rideau Hall]</ref> Rideau Hall is the site of most state banquets, investitures, swearing-in of ministers, and other ceremonies.<ref name="RH" /> Moreover, visiting heads of state usually reside at the palace. Another principal residence of the Governor General is [[La Citadelle]], in [[Quebec City]].  The provinces of [[British Columbia]], [[Manitoba]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[New Brunswick]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], and [[Prince Edward Island]] also maintain residences, used primarily by the respective Lieutenant Governor, though the monarch or other members of the Royal Family will reside there when in the province.

The aforementioned buildings belong to the Crown; they are held in trust for future rulers, and cannot be sold by the monarch. However, monarchs have owned homes and land in Canada in a private capacity: King [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]] owned Bedingfield Ranch, near [[Pekisko, Alberta]].<ref>[http://www.pch.gc.ca/royalvisit/prince-quiz-answers.htm Department of Canadian Heritage: Royal Visit 2001: Getting to Know the Prince(s) of Wales]</ref> [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]], sister of Queen Elizabeth II, also owned Portland Island. The land was presented to her during a visit to the province in 1958 until her death in 2002; however, she offered it to the Crown on permanent loan in 1966, after lengthy correspondence between the [[Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia|Lieutenant Governor]] and [[Kensington Palace]]. The island and surrounding waters eventually became [http://www.britishcolumbia.com/ParksAndTrails/Parks/details/?ID=525 Princess Margaret Marine Park].<ref name="Legacy">[http://www.bcarchives.gov.bc.ca/exhibits/jubilee/legacy.htm British Columbia Archives: The Legacy]</ref> As it is convention to conceal royal wills from the public, it is unkown as to whom the island was bequeathed by the Princess after her passing.<ref>[http://www.hellomagazine.ca/royalty/2002/06/26/margaret/ ''Hello Magazine'': Princess Margaret leaves her fortune to her children; June 26, 2002]</ref>

==The Crown and Aboriginal peoples==

The Crown has a long relationship with the [[First Nations]], [[Inuit]], and [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] peoples of [[Canada]].<ref>[http://www.umanitoba.ca/law/newsite/kawaskimhon_factums/FINALWrittenSubmissionsofFederalCrown_windsor.pdf ''In the Kawaskimhon Aboriginal Moot Court'': Factum of the Federal Crown Canada; University of Manitoba, Faculty of Law; 2007; pg. 2]</ref> As with the [[Māori]] and the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] in [[New Zealand]], Canada's [[First Nations]] view their treaties as being agreements directly between them and the Crown, not with the ever-changing [[government of Canada]]. The [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] remains an important document,<ref>[http://web2.uvcs.uvic.ca/courses/igov/igov383%202006/pdfs/Wampum%20at%20Niagra%20Oct%209%20-%2018.pdf Borrows, John; ''Wampum at Niagara: The Royal Proclamation, Canadian Legal History, and Self-Government''; University of Victoria; pg. 170]</ref> mentioned in the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], outlining the Crown's responsibility to protect First Nations' territories, and act as a fudiciary between the government and aboriginal peoples in Canada.<ref name="UMan7">University of Manitoba; pg. 7</ref><ref>[http://www.ualberta.ca/~nativest/pim/waitangi.htm A Historical Analysis of Early Nation to Nation Relations in Canada and New Zealand:The Royal Proclamation of 1763, the Treaty of Niagara and The Treaty of Waitangi]</ref><ref>[http://www.treaty6.ca/princ.html Fundamental Treaty Principals]</ref> It is thus, and further outlined in the Constitution Act, 1867, solely the responsibility of the federal Crown to establish [[Indian reserve|reserves]] and negotiate further treaties, though the maintenance of reserves may fall to the relevant provincial crown.<ref name="UMan7" />

Over the centuries there have been literal and symbolic gestures to demonstrate the ''nation-to-nation'' relationship, from the commemoration by [[Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] of the [[Four Mohawk Kings]] in 1710,<ref>[http://www.tyendinaga.net/history/ Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory]</ref> to Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] donating a piece of [[Balmoral]] granite engraved with the ciphers of [[Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] and herself to the [[First Nations University of Canada]] in 2005.<ref>[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/Page/document/v5/content/subscribe?user_URL=http://www.theglobeandmail.com%2Fservlet%2FArticleNews%2FTPStory%2FLAC%2F20050511%2FNATIVES11%2FTPNational%2FCanada&ord=1169237438207&brand=theglobeandmail&force_login=true Monchuk, Judy; ''The Globe and Mail'': Natives decry 'token' presence for Queen's visit; May 11, 2005]</ref> The First Nations, in return, honour members of the Royal Family with ceremonies and traditional titles.

==The Crown and the Canadian Forces==
[[Image:Élisabeth II Chef des armées canadiennes.jpg|thumb|[[Equestrian statue]] of Elizabeth II, [[Commander-in-Chief of the Canadian Forces]], on [[Parliament Hill]], [[Ottawa]].]]
{{Main|The Canadian Crown and the Canadian Forces}}
As the repository of all authority in Canada, the Crown sits at the pinnacle of the [[Canadian Forces]]. The monarch is the [[Commander-in-Chief of the Canadian Forces|Commander-in-Chief of the entire forces]], though the Governor General holds this title and usually exercises the duties on behalf of the sovereign.<ref>[http://www.gg.ca/gg/rr/cc/hist_e.asp Governor General of Canada: Commander in Chief of the Canadian Forces]</ref> The monarch is also the Honorary Commissioner of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]].<ref>[http://www.regiments.org/biography/royals/1926eliz.htm Land Forces: H.M. Elizabeth II Queen of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]</ref>

The sovereign's position and role in the military is reflected by [[navy|naval vessels]] bearing the prefix ''[[Her Majesty's Canadian Ship]]'' (HMCS){{ndash}} ''His Majesty's Canadian Ship'' during the reign of a king{{ndash}} and all members of the  forces must swear allegiance to the Queen and her heirs and successors. Members of the Royal Family are also [[Colonel-in-Chief]] of many Canadian regiments. As such, they have presided over military ceremonies both abroad and at home, including [[Trooping the Colour|Troopings of the Colour]], inspections of the troops, and anniversaries of key battles; whenever the sovereign or a member of her family is in [[Ottawa]], they lay a wreath at the [[National War Memorial (Canada)|National War Memorial]].
:''Further information: [[List of Canadian organizations with royal patronage#Military|List of Canadian Organizations with royal patronage: Military]]''

==Organizations with royal association==
Besides government and military institutions, a number of Canadian civilian organizations have association with the monarchy, either through their being founded via a Royal Charter, having been granted the right to use the prefix ''royal'' before their name, or because at least one member of the [[#Canadian Royal Family|Royal Family]] serves as a patron.

===Crown corporations===
{{main|Crown corporations of Canada}}
Canadian Crown corporations are [[state]]-owned enterprises, within either the federal or provincial sphere, that are technically operated by the Canadian monarch, as the institution's sole [[shareholder]], either as the Monarch-in-Right-of-Canada or the [[Monarchy in the Canadian provinces|Monarch-in-Right-of-[Province]]]. This follows the legal premise that [[the Crown]], as an institution, owns all the property of government. In practice, however, Crown corporations operate at arm's length from the government, with direct government control only being exerted over the corporation's budget and the appointment of its chairperson and directors through [[Order-in-Council]].

===Organizations under Royal Charter===
[[Image:Kings College.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[University of King's College]], founded by a [[Royal Charter]] issued in [[1802]] by King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].]]
:''Main article: [[Royal Charter#Canada|Royal Charter: Canada]]''
A [[Royal Charter]] is granted by [[Order-in-Council]], either creating an incorporated body, or giving an existent one special status.<ref>[http://www.privy-council.org.uk/output/page26.asp Privy Council Office: Royal Charter]</ref> This is an exercise of the [[Royal Prerogative]], and, in Canada, there are hundreds of organizations under Royal Charters. Such organizations include charities, businesses, colleges, universities, and cities. Today, it is mostly charities and professional institutions who receive Royal Charters.

Examples of organizations under Royal Charter are: the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], founded by Royal Charter issued by King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in [[1670]];<ref>[http://www.hbc.com/hbcheritage/collections/archival/charter/ Hudsons Bay Company: Corporate Collections: Reference: The Charter]</ref> the city of [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], receiving its charter in 1786 from King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]];<ref>[http://www.canadascities.ca/caoreport_062000_1.htm#3 ''Canada's Cities: Unleash our Potential'']</ref> [[Scouts Canada]], constituted by Royal Charter from King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] in 1912;<ref>[http://scoutdocs.ca/Scouts_Canada_Act/Royal_Charter.php ScoutDocs: Scout Canada Act: Royal Charter of the Boy Scouts Association]</ref> and [[McGill University]], which was first founded as the Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning by Royal Charter from King [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] in 1821, and subsequently reconstituted as McGill by Royal Charter issued by Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]] in 1852.<ref>[http://www.mcgill.ca/secretariat/charter-statutes/royal/ McGill University: Admin and governance: Secretariat: University Charter and Statutes: The Royal Charter of McGill University]</ref>

===Royal prefix===
[[Image:Royal Ontario Museum edit3.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[Royal Ontario Museum]] in [[Toronto]], given its royal prefix by [[Order-in-Council]] of the [[Monarchy in Ontario|Crown in Right of Ontario]] in [[1912]]. It is under the [[patron]]age of the [[Lieutenant Governor of Ontario]].]]
{{main|List of Canadian organizations with royal prefix}}
As a matter of honour, the monarch may bestow on an organization the right to use the prefix ''royal'' before its name; this may be done for any type of constituted group, from [[Royal Ottawa Golf Club]] to [[the Royal Canadian Regiment]]. The granting of this distinction falls within the Royal Prerogative, and thus is conferred by the monarch through the office of her viceroy, with input from the [[Department of Canadian Heritage]] on whether or not the institution meets the criteria of having been in existence for at least 25 years, being financially secure, and a non-profit organization, amongst others.<ref name="DCHroyal" />

===Organizations with royal patronage===
{{main|List of Canadian organizations with royal patronage}}
The practice of members of the Canadian Royal Family giving their [[patron]]age to Canadian organizations stems from that which started in the United Kingdom in pre-[[Industrial Revolution|industrial]] times, when all development of the [[science]]s and [[art]]s were under the direct control of the monarch and exercised by the foundation of [[college]]s that today form the basis of modern [[university|universities]]. Today, royal patronage is a ceremonial function wherein the royal will either volunteer their time for service or make charitable donations, in order to help bring recognition to the group's achievements and to the contributions of different sectors of public life.<ref>[http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page4900.asp Buckingham Palace: The Monarchy Today: Queen and Public: Charities and Special Associations]</ref>

Any organization may apply for royal patronage, via the office of the Governor General; however, to receive the honour, an organization must prove to be long lasting and have aims and objectives that will earn the approval of the person from whom patronage is requested.<ref name="DCHroyal">[http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/fr-rf/criter_e.cfm Department of Canadian Heritage: Criteria for Royal patronage]</ref> Also, patronage is typically granted to athletic, artistic, cultural, or [[charitable organizations]]; rarely to [[Corporation|corporate]] or [[Business|for-profit]] companies. Some charities and volunteer organizations have been founded as gifts to, or in honour of, some of Canada's monarchs or members of the Royal Family, such as the [[Victorian Order of Nurses]] (a gift to Queen Victoria for her [[Diamond Jubilee#Diamond Jubilee for Queen Victoria|Diamond Jubilee]] in 1897), the Canadian Cancer Fund (set up in honour of King George V's [[Silver Jubilee#Silver Jubilees in the United Kingdom|Silver Jubilee]] in 1935), and the Queen Elizabeth II Fund to Aid in Research on the Diseases of Children.

===Awards===

A number of awards in Canada are issued in the name of previous or present members of the Royal Family.

==Debate==
{{main|Debate on the monarchy in Canada}}
To date, there has been little national debate centring on the monarchy of Canada, in contrast to some other [[Commonwealth realm]]s, where the issue has gained a relatively higher profile. Many Canadians, though, continue to be unaware that the Queen serves as their head of state; a 2002 [[EKOS Research Associates|EKOS]] poll found that only five percent of the population could correctly identify Elizabeth II as their head of state (the majority believing it to be the [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]]).<ref>[http://www.ekos.com/admin/articles/31may2001.pdf Eskos poll]</ref>

Where debate does exist, it tends to be a largely academic one, and several books have been written that explore the subject from a [[political science]] perspective. Unlike some other Commonwealth realms, Canada has never had a head of government who has been openly republican. Neither of Canada's two most prominent political parties, the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] or the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]], is officially in favour of abolishing the monarchy; though the latter makes support for constitutional monarchy a founding principle in its policy declaration.<ref>[http://www.conservative-own.ca/documents/policy031905.pdf#search='conservative%20party%20of%20canada%20objectives%20monarchy' Conservative Party of Canada: Policy Declaration]</ref> The [[New Democratic Party]] (NDP) has no official position on the role of the monarchy, while the leaders of the ''[[Bloc Québécois]]'' are vocally opposed to the Crown.<ref>[http://cfcn.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/scfcn/CTVNews/20080507/gg_france_080507 CTV News: ''Bloc Quebecois leader calls monarchy 'ridiculous'''; May 7, 2008]</ref><ref>[http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=c78844d9-74e2-4665-a030-14305de0e119 Thompson, Elizabeth; ''The Gazette'': Royal rumble: Queen not welcome at Quebec celebrations, Duceppe says; April 17 2007]</ref><ref>[http://entertainment.yahoo.ca/s/capress/080507/national/jean_angry_separatists Panetta, Alexander; The Canadian Press: ''Separatists call GG 'ridiculous' after she promotes Canada in France''; May 7, 2008]</ref> Some politicians, having [[Oath of Allegiance (Canada)|pledged allegiance to the Queen]], have occasionally publicly voiced their opinion on the matter, following former-[[Deputy Prime Minister of Canada|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[John Manley (politician)|John Manley]]'s 2002 statement that he was in favour of abolishing the monarchy.<ref>[http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20021006/manley_monarchy_021005?s_name=pope&no_ads=no CTV News: ''Manley regrets focus on anti-monarchy comments''; October 6, 2002]</ref>

Though it was not the case prior to the 1960s,<ref>[http://pages.interlog.com/~rakhshan/pmyth.html Canadian Monarchist Online: Anti-monarchy myths]. Former Prime Minister Sir [[Wilfred Laurier]] stated: "French-Canadians have not forgotten France [and their culture]... Here in France, people are surprised at the attachment French Canadians feel for the Queen, and we are faithful to the great nation which has given us liberty."</ref> shifting attitudes in Quebec nationalism have made it the one province that has recently shown significant republican sentiment; the ''[[Parti Québécois]]'' has, like its federal counterpart, at times expressed hostility to the institution of the monarchy. However, as the party views [[Quebec sovereignty]] as a more pressing concern, and sees the Crown as a purely federal institution (despite the existence of the [[Monarchy in Quebec|Crown in Right of Quebec]]),<ref>[http://pages.interlog.com/~rakhshan/pmyth.html Canadian Monarchist Online: Anti-monarchy myths]</ref> it has recently tended to decline comment on the issue.

Canada has two special-interest groups representing the debate, who frequently argue the issue in the media: the [[Monarchist League of Canada]] and [[Citizens for a Canadian Republic]].<ref>[http://www.monarchist.ca/new/index.html The Monarchist League of Canada: Who we are and what we do]</ref><ref>[http://www.canadian-republic.ca/goals.html Citizens for a Canadian Republic: Our goals]</ref> There are also other [[Loyalist|loyal]] organizations, such as the [http://www.uelac.org/ The United Empire Loyalists' Association of Canada], the [http://www.crht.ca/index.html Canadian Royal Heritage Trust], the [http://members.aol.com/totarisse/menu-en.html Democratic Canadian Union], and the [[Orange Order in Canada]].
