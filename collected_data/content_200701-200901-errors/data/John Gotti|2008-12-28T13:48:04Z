'''John Joseph Gotti, Jr.''' (October 27, 1940 &ndash; June 10, 2002), commonly known by the [[Mass media|media]] as "The Dapper Don" and "The Teflon Don" after the murder of his former boss [[Paul Castellano]], was the [[crime boss|boss]] of the well known [[Gambino crime family]], one of the [[Five Families]] in [[New York City]]. He became widely known for his outspoken personality and flamboyant style that eventually caused his downfall. In 1992, Gotti was convicted of [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act|racketeering]], 13 murders, [[obstruction of justice]], [[hijacking]], [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to commit murder, [[illegal gambling]], [[extortion]], [[tax evasion]], [[loansharking]] and other crimes and was sentenced to [[life imprisonment|life in prison]] where he died 10 years later.

==Early life and family==
Gotti was born to Italian-American parents John Gotti Sr and Philomena "Fannie" Gotti. He was 12 when his family moved to [[Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn]] where he and his brothers [[Peter Gotti|Peter]] and [[Richard V. Gotti|Richard]] became part of a local street gang. In the early summer of 1954, while trying to steal a cement mixer, the mixer tipped over, crushing Gotti's foot, giving him a limp that would last him his life. 

In 1962, Gotti married Victoria DeGiorgio. They had five children, Angela (Angel), [[Victoria Gotti|Victoria]], [[John A. Gotti|John A. "Junior" Gotti]], Peter and Frank. John Gotti did not think very highly of his family, being recorded on video as saying "I took garbage Gotti blood and contaminated it with DiGiorgio blood."<ref>[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/blowingupgotti Blowing up Gotti -Episode 4: Gotti Blood]</ref> Gotti was also recorded on video as saying to his daughter Victoria "I'm not your father or John's father or these kids's grandfather." <ref>[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/blowingupgotti Blowing up Gotti -Episode 5: I Got Nothin']</ref>

A brutal and short tempered family man, John Gotti used to subject his wife and son to regular beatings. This has been proven by FBI tapes, and later became media fodder for the New York papers.

==Criminal career ==
Gotti's criminal career with the Gambinos began with fencing stolen goods from Idlewild Airport (later renamed [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]]) out of the [[Bergin Hunt and Fish Club]] in [[Ozone Park, Queens]]. A truck to JFK's [[United Airlines]] cargo area  drove off with $30,000 worth of merchandise. A few days later the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) began surveillance on Gotti and Ruggiero and caught them loading more goods, the FBI swooped in and arrested all three men.

In February 1968, United employees identified Gotti as the man who signed for the earlier stolen merchandise.  The FBI arrested him for the United hijacking soon after. Two months later, while out on bail, Gotti was arrested a third-time for hijacking--this time stealing a load of cigarettes worth $50,000 on the [[New Jersey Turnpike]]. Later that year Gotti pled guilty to the Northwest hijacking and was sentenced to four years at [[Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary]]. Prosecutors dropped the charges for the cigarette hijacking. Gotti also pled guilty to the United hijacking. Gotti spent less than three years at Lewisburg. 

After he was released from prison, he was placed on probation and ordered to find a legitimate job. Meanwhile he returned to his old crew at the Bergin club, still working under caporegime [[Carmine Fatico]]. Fatico was indicted on loansharking charges and made Gotti the acting [[Caporegime|capo]] of the Bergin Crew reporting to [[Carlo Gambino]] and [[Aniello Dellacroce]]. Gotti's crew, however, were found to be selling [[heroin]], against the rules of the family, with his members possibly killed. Gotti and others had [[Paul Castellano]] shot six times along with his bodyguard, Thomas Bilotti, outside [[Sparks Steak House]], and Gotti took control of the family. 

As the boss of the largest mafia family in New York Gotti controlled loansharking and gambling networks, infiltration of construction and trucking [[labor unions]], extortion and complex financial fraud. During the late 1980s, Gotti's income would exceed a million dollars per month as he received tribute from more then 300 soldiers. Naturally, Gotti declared none of this income and claimed to be a plumbing supply salesman so he could declare enough income to live modestly in [[Howard Beach]]. Gotti's daily routine began around noon. He would stop in at a social club near his home in Queens and have lunch, meeting with members of his old crew including his brother [[Peter Gotti]] who served as his cash collector or 'bag man'. In the evening Gotti would dress in an expensive Delisi suit and be driven to the former Little Italy headquarters of the late Aniello Dellacroce, the [[Ravenite Social Club]]. Here he would meet daily with capos and senior soldiers and associates. Gotti would often be seen (by locals and the FBI alike) on 'walk and talks' down the street with top Gambino members. Later in the evening Gotti would frequent nightclubs with his close friends, including current Gambino boss [[Jackie D'Amico]]. 

Gotti was arrested several times throughout his career, serving time in both state and federal prison (including a [[manslaughter]] conviction in connection with the 1973 shooting death of low-level [[Irish-American]] gangster [[James McBratney]], who had kidnapped and killed Emmanuel Gambino, Carlo Gambino's nephew). By the 1980s, he was referred to by the news media as the "[[Teflon]] Don" as he avoided conviction on racketeering and assault charges.

==Death of Frank Gotti== 
On March 18, 1980, 12-year-old Frank Gotti, youngest son of John Gotti was run over and killed on his bicycle by neighbor [[John Favara]] whose children were friends with Frank Gotti.

Police found Favara was not to blame in the accident, which was officially ruled "accidental" and no charges were ever filed against him. However, in the months after the accident, the word "Murderer" was spray-painted onto Favara's car. On May 28, Victoria DiGiorgio Gotti, Frank's mother, attacked Favara with a metal baseball bat, sending him to the hospital. Favara decided not to press charges and planned to move out of Howard Beach. According to the FBI, on July 28, 1980, Favara was kidnapped and murdered by eight members of Gotti's crew while Gotti and his wife were out of town.<ref name=don>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Don Is Done  |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E5DB1239F932A05752C0A96F958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=6  |quote= |work=[[New York Times]] |date=January 31, 1999 |accessdate=2008-10-23 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,134529,00.html Feds Search 'Mafia Graveyard' in New York]</ref><ref>[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/mob_bosses/gotti/gotti_8.html The Tragedy of Frank Gotti]</ref>

The New York Police Department was contacted days after Favara disappeared and the caller, who seemed to have an intimate knowledge of what had happened, claimed that Favara had been kidnapped by Gotti's henchmen and been held captive until Gotti returned from vacation.  Then, despite Favara's pleas for mercy, John Gotti himself dismembered Favara with a chainsaw. <ref>''Goombata'', by John Cummings and Ernest Volkman, Avon Books, c. 1992, page 164.</ref>

==Trial and imprisonment==
[[Image:GottiPrison.jpg|right|300px|thumb|John Gotti after getting physically assaulted in prison.]]
Gotti was under electronic surveillance by the FBI; they caught him on tape in an apartment discussing a number of murders and other criminal activities. The FBI also caught Gotti denigrating his underboss, [[Sammy Gravano|Salvatore "Sammy The Bull" Gravano]]. On December 11, 1990, FBI agents and New York City detectives raided the Ravenite Social Club and arrested Gotti, Gravano, [[Frank Locascio]], and [[Thomas Gambino]].

Gotti was charged with 13 counts of murder (including Paul Castellano and Thomas Bilotti), conspiracy to commit murder, loansharking, racketeering, obstruction of justice, illegal gambling, and tax evasion. 

Gotti was tried in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York]] before Judge [[I. Leo Glasser]]. The federal prosecutor's evidence was overwhelming. Not only did they have Gotti on tape, but they also had several witnesses to testify against Gotti. [[Phil Leonetti|Philip Leonetti]], a former Underboss in the violent [[Philadelphia crime family]], was going to testify that Gotti bragged that he had ordered Castellano's execution. Then, Gotti's own Underboss Gravano voluntarily agreed to testify against his boss and Consigliere [[Frank Locascio|Frank LoCascio]] with the promise of being entered into the [[Witness Protection Program]]. On April 2, 1992, after only 13 hours of deliberation, the jury found Gotti and LoCascio guilty on all 13 charges.<ref>[http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters_outlaws/mob_bosses/gotti/don_24.html John Gotti - The Last Mafia Icon - The Crime library<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> On June 23, 1992, Judge Glasser sentenced Gotti to life imprisonment without possibility of parole.<ref>[http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters_outlaws/mob_bosses/gotti/don_24.html?sect=15 John Gotti - The Last Mafia Icon - The Crime library<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  He was sent to the [[USP Marion|United States Penitentiary at Marion, Illinois]], where he was kept in a cell 23 hours a day. Four days later, his father died of heart failure. Allegedly, Gotti offered $100,000 to the [[Aryan Brotherhood]] if they would kill Walter Johnson, a black man who had brutally beaten him. Gotti was told that his offer was accepted and that his attacker would be taken care of. The prison guards surmised that Johnson was in danger and began moving him to different locations and ultimately transferred him to another prison where he was paroled. It was later revealed that the Aryan Brotherhood had hired Johnson to beat Gotti, after Gotti had stopped paying the AB for protection money, claiming that he had enough of 'his men' on the inside, and did not need the assistance of the Aryan Brotherhood anymore. After Gotti's death, it became apparent that the Brotherhood had no real intention of carrying out the hit on Johnson.

==Death and funeral==   
[[Image:Image-Bureau_of_Prisons_image_-_John_Gotti.jpg|thumb|right|Last known picture of an ill John Gotti]] 
Gotti died of [[throat cancer]] at 12:45 p.m. on June 10, 2002 at the [[Medical Center for Federal Prisoners, Springfield|United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners]] in [[Springfield, Missouri]], where he had been transferred once the cancer was diagnosed.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=John Gotti Dies in Prison at 61.

He was 61. The cause was cancer. In 1998, Mr. Gotti was operated on for neck and head cancer. He had been re-admitted to the hospital several times since then for treatment.  |work=[[New York Times]] |date=June 11, 2002 |accessdate=2008-10-23 }}</ref> Gotti had the lower half of his jaw removed due to the cancer and was fed through a tube. The [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn]] announced that Gotti's family would not be permitted to have a [[Requiem|Mass of Christian Burial]] but allowed Gotti's family to have a Requiem after burial.
