A '''comedian''' ('''comedienne''' if female), or '''comic''', is a performer who seeks to entertain an audience, primarily by making them laugh.  This might be through [[joke]]s or amusing situations, or acting the fool, as in [[slapstick]], or employing [[prop comedy]].  A comedian who stands alone and addresses an audience directly is called a [[stand-up comedy|stand-up comic]].

A comedian can be distinguished from a [[clown]] because clowns most often use slapstick, wear costumes and makeup, and engage in buffoonery, whereas comedians most often focus on a more verbal style of humor, telling jokes.

A popular saying, variously quoted but generally attributed to [[Ed Wynn]],<ref name=Bartleby>{{cite web|title=Simpson's Contemporary Quotations, 1988|url=http://www.bartleby.com/63/93/8993.html|accessdate=2008-04-01}}</ref> is, "A comic says funny things; a comedian says things funny," which draws a distinction between how much of the comedy can be attributed to verbal content and how much to acting and persona.

Since the late 1980s, a new wave of comedy, called [[alternative comedy]], grew in  popularity with its more offbeat and experimental style.  This normally involves more experiential, or observational reporting, e.g. [[Andy Kaufman]], [[Alexei Sayle]] and [[Malcolm Hardee]].  Alternative comedy is now arguably the mainstream.  

As far as content is concerned, comedians such as [[Tommy Tiernan]] draw on their background to poke fun at themselves, while others such as [[Bill Maher]] and [[George Carlin]] have strong political and cultural undertones.

Many comics achieve a [[cult following]] while touring famous comedy hubs such as the [[Just for Laughs]] festival in [[Montreal]], the [[Edinburgh Fringe]], and [[Melbourne Comedy Festival]] in [[Australia]].  Often a comic's career advances significantly when they win a notable comedy award, such as the now defunct [[Perrier Award]].  Comics typically survive by continuous touring and foray into other areas of entertainment, such as film and television, when they have become much better known.
