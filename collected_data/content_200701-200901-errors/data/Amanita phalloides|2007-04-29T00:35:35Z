'''''Amanita phalloides''''' is a [[basidiomycete]] [[fungus]], one of many in the genus ''[[Amanita]]''. Widely distributed across [[Europe]], ''A. phalloides'' forms [[mycorrhiza|ectomycorrhizal]] associations with various deciduous and coniferous trees. An adaptable organism, its range is expanding in other countries after accidental introduction in association with [[oak]], [[chestnut]] and [[Pinus|pine]].

Like many basidiomycetes, ''A. phalloides'' produces large [[epigeous]] fruiting bodies known to the public as [[mushroom]]s or [[toadstool]]s, and to [[mycologist]]s as [[Sporocarp (fungi)|sporocarps]] or [[basidiocarp|basidiomes]]. They have an infamous reputation for being one of the most poisonous of all fungal fruiting bodies known thus far, and are likely to be responsible for the majority of human deaths from mushroom poisoning.<ref name="benjamin95">{{cite book |last=Benjamin| first= Denis R. |chapter=Amatoxin syndrome  |title=Mushrooms: poisons and panaceas — a handbook for naturalists, mycologists and physicians |publisher=WH Freeman and Company| location=New York |year=1995|pages=198–214| isbn=0-7167-2600-9}}</ref> Unfortunately, they resemble several edible species commonly consumed by humans, increasing the risk of accidental ingestion. This toxicity is reflected in the common name given to the species, the '''death cap'''.

Its principal toxic constituent is [[alpha-amanitin|α-amanitin]], which damages the liver and kidneys, often fatally. The other main agent identified, [[phalloidin]], is not thought to contribute to toxicity when consumed.

==Taxonomy and naming==
The death cap was first described by French botanist [[Sébastien Vaillant]] in 1727, who gave a succinct phrase name "''Fungus phalloides, annulatus, sordide virescens, et patulus''," which is still recognizable as the fungus today.<ref>{{la icon}}{{cite book|last=Vaillant|first=Sébastien|year=1727|title=Botanicon Parisiense|location=Leide & Amsterdam|publisher=J. H. Verbeek and B. Lakeman|oclc=5146641}}</ref> Though the [[scientific name]] ''phalloides'' means "phallus-shaped", it is unclear whether it is named for its resemblance to a litteral [[phallus]] or the Stinkhorn mushrooms ''[[Phallus (genus)|Phallus]]''.
In 1821, [[Elias Magnus Fries]] described it as "''Agaricus phalloides''", but included all white Amanitas within its description.<ref>{{la icon}}{{cite book |last=Fries |first=Elias Magnus |title=Systema Mycologicum I |year=1821 |publisher=Ernesti
Mauritii |location=Gryphiswaldiae|oclc=10717479 }}</ref> Finally in 1833, [[Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link]] settled on the name ''Amanita phalloides'',<ref>{{de}} Link JHF (1833) ''Grundriss der Kraeuterkunde IV''. Haude und Spenerschen Buchhandlung (S.J. Joseephy), Berlin</ref> after [[Christian Hendrik Persoon|Persoon]] had named it ''Amanita viridis'' thirty years earlier.<ref>{{la icon}}{{cite book |last=Persoon |first=Christian Hendrik |title=Tentamen Dispositionis Methodicae Fungorum |year=1797 |publisher=P.P.

Dietrich |location=GÖttingen|oclc=28329773 }}</ref> Although [[Louis Secretan]]'s use of the name ''Amanita phalloides'' predates Link's, it has been rejected for nomenclatural purposes because Secretan's works did not use [[binomial nomenclature]] consistently.

''Amanita phalloides'' is the [[type species]] of ''Amanita'' section ''Phalloideae'', a group that contains all of the deadly poisonous ''Amanita'' species thus far identified. Most notable of these are the species known as [[destroying angel]]s, namely ''[[Amanita virosa]]'' and ''[[Amanita bisporiga|A. bisporiga]]'' as well as the fools mushroom ''([[Amanita verna|A. verna]])''. This common name has been applied to ''A. phalloides'' at times, but "death cap" is by far the most common common name used in English. Other common names also listed include stinking amanita<ref name = "North67"/> and deadly amanita.<ref name="benjamin95"/>

==Description==
[[Image:Amanita phalloïdes.jpg|right|thumb|A young death cap emerging from universal veil ([[France]]).]]

The death cap has a large and distinctive [[fungus|fungal]] [[fruiting body]] (basidiocarp), usually with a [[pileus]] (cap) from 5 to 15&nbsp;[[centimetre|cm]] (2–6&nbsp;[[inch|in]]) across, initially rounded and semi-spherical, but flattening with age. Easily peeled and sticky when wet, the cap surface can be pale-, yellowish- or olive-green and is often paler after rain. The colour may also be paler toward the margins of the cap. A [[partial veil]] is present, and the  crowded white [[Lamella (mycology)|lamellae]] (gills) are free.

The white [[stipe]] is  4 to 18&nbsp;cm long and 1 to 3&nbsp;cm-thick with a skirtlike, floppy [[annulus (mycology)|annulus]] and a swollen volva (base), and jagged edges which stand out from the stalk. As the volva, which may be hidden by leaf litter, is a distinctive and diagnostic feature, it is important to remove some debris to check for one.<ref name="Jord01">{{cite book | author=Jordan P, Wheeler S. | year=2001 | title=The Ultimate Mushroom Book | location=London | publisher=Hermes House}}</ref> The smell has been described as initially faint and honey-sweet but strengthening over time to become overpowering, sickly-sweet and objectionable.<ref name="Zeitl76"/> Young specimens first emerge from the ground resembling a white egg covered by a universal veil, which then breaks, leaving the volva as a remnant. The [[spore print]] is white, a common feature of ''Amanita''. The transparent spores are globular to egg-shaped, measures 8-10&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]] long and stain blue with [[iodine]].<ref name="Zeitl76"/>

A rarely appearing all-white form has been designated ''A. phalloides'' var. ''alba'',<ref name="Jord01"/> though its status has been unclear. It has been described in 2004 as a distinct variety and includes ''A. verna'' var. ''tarda''.<ref name="Nevpoum04"/>

===Similarity to edible species===

This is a leading cause of mushroom poisoning in the [[United States]]. Novices may also mistake death caps for other edible ''Amanita'' species such as ''[[Amanita lanei]]'', and for this reason, some authorities recommend avoiding the collection of ''Amanita'' species for the table altogether.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kuo| first=Michael| year=2005| month=March| title=The Genus Amanita| url=http://www.mushroomexpert.com/amanita.html| publisher=MushroomExpert.com|accessdate=2007-05-22}}</ref> 

In Europe, other similarly greenish species collected by mushroom hunters include various green-hued brittlegills of the genus ''[[Russula]]'', and the formerly popular ''[[Tricholoma flavovirens]]''. However, the latter species is now regarded as hazardous after a series of restaurant poisonings in [[France]]. The brittlegills, such as ''[[Russula heterophylla]]'' can be distinguished by their brittle flesh and the lack of either a volva or ring.<ref name="Zeitl76">{{cite book|last=Zeitlmayr|first= Linus|year=1976|title=Wild Mushrooms:An Illustrated Handbook|publisher=Garden City Press|location=Hertfordshire|isbn= 0-584-10324-7}}</ref>

Other similar species include ''[[Amanita subjunquillea|A. subjunquillea]]'' in eastern [[Asia]] and ''[[Amanita arocheae|A. arocheae]]'', which ranges from Andean [[Colombia]] to central [[Mexico]] (at least). All these fungi are [[mycorrhizal]].

''Amanita phalloides'' has been conveyed to new countries across the southern hemisphere with the importation of hardwoods and conifers.

Death caps fruit from late summer to autumn, appearing after periods of rain.<ref name="Zeitl76"/> It is [[ectomycorrhizally]] associated with a number of tree species; In Europe, these include a large number of [[hardwood]] and, less commonly, [[conifer]] species.

==Toxicity==
[[Image:Death Cap Mushroom.jpg|thumb|right|Warning sign in [[Canberra]], [[Australia]].]]
As the common name suggests, the fungus is highly toxic, and is responsible for the majority of fatal [[mushroom poisoning]]s worldwide. It is estimated that 30&nbsp;[[gram]]s (half a cap) of this mushroom is enough to kill a human.<ref name="benjamin95"/> Furthermore, the toxicity is not reduced by cooking, freezing or drying. Not surprisingly, intensive research into its biochemisry have been done for decades.<ref name="Litten75"/>

Recent cases highlight the issue of its similarity to ''Volvariella volvacea'', with southeast-asian immigrants in Australia and the west coast of the United States falling victim, including a tragic episode in [[Oregon]] where four members of a [[Korea]]n family required liver transplants.<ref name="benjamin95"/> Of the seven people poisoned in the [[Canberra]] region between 1988 and 1998 three were from [[Laos]].<ref name="trim99"/>

===Biochemistry===
The species is now known to contain two main groups of toxins, both [[Cyclic compound|multicyclic]] (ring-shaped) [[peptide]]s, spread throughout the mushroom [[Thallus (tissue)|thallus]]: the [[amatoxin]]s and the [[phallotoxin]]s. Another toxin is [[phallolysin]], which has shown some [[haemolysis|haemolytic]] (red blood cell-destroying) activity ''in vitro''. An unrelated compound, an [[antamanide]] has also been isolated.

Amatoxins consist of at least eight compounds with a similar structure, that of eight amino-acid rings. By name they are [[α-amanitin]], [[β-amanitin]], [[γ-amanitin]], [[epsilon-amanitin|ε-amanitin]], [[amanullinic acid]], [[amanin (organic compound)|amanin]], [[amanullin]] and [[proamanullin]]. Isolated in 1941 by [[Heinrich Otto Wieland|Heinrich O. Wieland]] and Rudolf Hallermayer of the [[Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich|University of Munich]],<ref name="Litten75"/> α-amanitin is the main toxin responsible for the deadly effects of the death cap.<ref name=" Karlson-Stiber">{{cite journal |author=Karlson-Stiber C, Persson H |title=Cytotoxic fungi - an overview |journal=Toxicon |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=339-49 |year=2003 |pmid=14505933|doi=10.1016/S0041-0101(03)00238-1}}</ref>

The phallotoxins consist of at least seven compounds, all of which have seven similar peptid rings.  [[Phalloidin]] had been isolated in 1937 by [[Feodor Felix Konrad Lynen|Feodor Lynen]], Heinrich Wieland's student and son-in-law, and Ulrich Wieland of the University of Munich. The remaining six are [[prophalloin]], [[phalloin]], [[phallisin]], [[phallicidin]], [[phallacin]] and [[phallisacin]]. Though highly toxic to liver cells, it has since been found to have little input into the death cap's toxicity as it is not absorbed through the gut. Furthermore, it is also found in the edible (and sought after) [[Blusher]] (''Amanita rubescens'').<ref name="Litten75"/>

===Symptoms===
Death caps have been reported to taste pleasant.<ref name="Litten75"/><ref name="Clel76">{{cite book | last= Cleland|first= John Burton |origyear=1934 | year=1976| title=Toadstools and mushrooms and other larger fungi of South Australia | publisher=South Australian Government Printer| oclc=15150059 }}</ref> This, coupled with the delay in symptoms appearing—eight to twelve hours, sometimes 24, during which time irreparable damage may be occurring—makes it particularly dangerous. Initially, symptoms are [[gastrointestinal]] in nature, and include [[Biliary colic|colicky]] abdominal pain, watery [[diarrhea]] and [[vomiting]], which may lead to [[dehydration]]. These first symptoms resolve two to three days after the ingestion, before a more serious deterioration signifying liver involvement—[[jaundice]], diarrhea, [[delirium]], [[seizures]] and [[coma]] due to [[liver failure]] and [[hepatic encephalopathy]] (accumulation of normally liver-removed substance in the blood) may then occur.<ref name = "North67">{{cite book | last=North |first=Pamela Mildred | year=1967 | title=Poisonous plants and fungi in colour| location=London  | publisher=Blandford Press|oclc=955264}}</ref> [[Renal failure]] often occurs, but generally not until after the liver is involved.<ref>{{cite journal|first=János| last=Vetter|year=1998| month=January| title=Toxins of ''Amanita phalloides''| journal=Toxicon| volume=36| issue=1 |pages=13-24|pmid=9604278| doi=10.1016/S0041-0101(97)00074-3}}</ref>  Death generally occurs six to sixteen days after the poisoning.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fineschi V, Di Paolo M, Centini F |title=Histological criteria for diagnosis of amanita phalloides poisoning |journal=J.

Up to the mid-20th century, the mortality rate was around sixty to seventy percent, but this has greatly improved with advances in medical care. A review of death cap poisoning throughout Europe from 1971 to 1980, found the overall mortality rate to be 22.4% (51.3% in children under ten, and 16.5% in those older than ten).<ref name="Floer82">{{de icon}}{{cite journal| last=Floerscheim| first=G.L.| Coauthors=O.

===Treatment===
Consumption of the death cap is a [[medical emergency]] requiring hospitalization. The amatoxins' main mechanism is inhibition of [[RNA polymerase II]], a vital enzyme in cell metabolism, thus affecting [[mRNA]] synthesis and leading to cell death.<ref name=" Karlson-Stiber"/> The [[liver]] is the principal organ affected, as it is the organ which is first encountered after absorbtion in the gastrointestinal symptom, though other organs, especially the [[kidney]]s, are susceptible.<ref name="benjamin95"/> Treatment is mainly supportive ([[gastric lavage]], [[activated carbon]], [[Fluid replacement|fluid resuscitation]]), though serious cases may require a [[liver transplantation]].<ref>{{cite journal|author= Klein, Andrew S.

==Notable victims==
The cause of the early demise of several historical figures was speculated to be poisonings by ''Amanita phalloides'' (or other [[destroying angel]] amanitas), either accidentally or as an [[assassination]]. Alleged victims of this kind of poisoning include Roman Emperor [[Claudius]], [[Pope Clement VII]], Tsaritsa [[Natalia Naryshkina]], and [[Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI]].<ref name=wasson>{{cite journal|last=Wasson|first=Robert Gordon| year=1972| title=The death of Claudius, or mushrooms for murderers|journal=Botanical Museum Leaflets, Harvard University| volume=23| issue=3|pages=101–128|issn=0006-8098}}</ref>

[[R. Gordon Wasson]] recounted the details of these deaths, noting whether they were likely to have been caused by ''Amanita'' poisoning or not. In the case of Clement VII, the illness that lead to his death lasted some five months, clearly inconsistent with amatoxin poisoning. Natalia Naryshkina is said to have consumed a large quantity of pickled mushrooms near the time of her death, however, it is unclear whether the mushrooms themselves were poisonous or whether she simply succumbed to [[food poisoning]].<ref name=wasson/>

Charles VI became ill with indigestion after eating a dish of sauteed mushrooms, leading to an illness from which he died ten days later—symptomology that is consistent with amatoxin poisoning. Charles' death lead to the [[War of Austrian Succession]], leading [[Voltaire]] to note, "this dish of mushrooms changed the destiny of Europe".<ref name=wasson/>

The case of Claudius is more complex. It is known that Claudius was very fond of ''[[Amanita caesarea]]'' and many later sources have attributed his death to his being fed a meal of death caps instead of Caesar's mushrooms. However, ancient authors such as [[Tacitus]] and [[Suetonius]] are unanimous about the fact that poison was added to the mushroom dish, rather than the dish being prepared from poisonous mushrooms. Wasson speculates that the poison used to kill Claudius was derived from death caps, with a fatal dose of [[colocynth]] being administered later in his illness.<ref name=wasson/>
