'''Melbourne Victory Football Club''' is an [[association football|football (soccer)]] team in the [[Australian]] [[A-League]] based in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. They draw the largest average crowd of any A-League club and consistently set attendance records. As of 2008, they are the only club to complete the [[List of A-League champions|Premiership-Championship]] double, having won both during the [[A-League 2006-07|2006-07]] season. They are also the first club to win all three trophies available in the A-League, adding the [[2008 A-League Pre-Season Challenge Cup|2008 Pre-Season Challenge Cup]] to their Premiership and Championship wins, with a penalty shoot-out victory against the [[Wellington Phoenix]] on [[August 6]], [[2008]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.a-league.com.au/default.aspx?s=hal_newsdisplay&id=23098|title=Victory Claim Pre Season Cup|date=[[2008-08-06]]}}</ref>.

==History==
===The Beginning===

Melbourne Victory were founded in 2004 after the announcement of a revamped domestic league in Australia, which saw the [[National Soccer League]] disbanded in 2004 and replaced by the A-League. The Victory replaced Victorian teams [[South Melbourne FC]] and [[Melbourne Knights]], who now play in the second tier competition —- the [[Victorian Premier League]]. 

[[Football Federation Australia]] (FFA) approved the Melbourne Victory consortium as Melbourne's representative in the league, with [[Belgravia Leisure Pty Ltd]] backing the club. The chairman and CEO of Belgravia Leisure, [[Geoff Lord]], was installed as the inaugural chairman of Melbourne Victory F.C.

[[Gary Cole (footballer)|Gary Cole]] (an ex-[[Australia national football (soccer) team|Socceroo]]) was hired to become Football Operations manager, and was soon joined by [[Ernie Merrick]], appointed as head coach from the [[Victorian Institute of Sport]] (VIS). [[Archie Thompson]], a current Socceroo who had been playing in [[Belgium]] with [[Lierse S.K.]], was the club's first player signing. The club soon signed three more internationals for the inaugural squad - Socceroo [[Kevin Muscat]], [[Austria]]n [[Richard Kitzbichler]] and [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Geoffrey Claeys]].

The remainder of the squad was quickly assembled, although room was left for signings before Melbourne played its first competitive match against [[Adelaide United]] in a [[World Club Championship]] qualifier. Unfortunately, this resulted in a up and down first season. Whilst highlights included a 5-0 drubbing of major rivals [[Sydney FC]], Melbourne Victory finished as the worst Australian team (ahead of the [[New Zealand Knights]]), whilst Sydney, their major rivals went on to win the first [[A-league]] Championship. 

===A-League 06/07===

Melbourne began the 2006-2007 Hyundai A-League season hoping to vastly improve on their 7th place in the inaugral 2005-2006 season. Coach Ernie Merrick had made a number of off-season signings to bolster the squad with skill and experience including 3 Brazilians [[Alessandro]], [[Claudinho]], [[Fred]] along with Scottish Premier League player [[Grant Brebner]].  After a hugely successful round 2 fixture against Sydney FC at the Telstra Dome which attrached the largest home and away crowd for regular club match, Melbourne Victory announced that they would move all but one match from Olympic Park to the new venue  Melbourne would become  the first team to complete the [[A-League]] double in the history of the competition; clinching the premiership against the [[New Zealand Knights]] 4-0 at Olympic Park with 4 rounds of competition remaining, then beating [[Adelaide United]] 6-0 in the grand final at a sold out [[Telstra Dome]] to take the championship.  Melbourne also qualified for the 2008 Asian Champions League as A-League Champions. 

===A-League 07/08===

Looking to capitalise on their successful 2006/07 campaign, Melbourne made some strong off-season signs including former Socceroo [[Ljubo Milicevic]] and Costa Rican international [[Carlos Hernández (soccer)|Carlos Hernández]] to cover the hole left by the departure of Fred to MLS club [[DC United]].  Again with the league largest crowds and a record membership of over 20,000, Melbourne were undefeated after 7 rounds but the season would slip away with some poor home performances and a mounting injury list.  A late season rally gave Melbourne a hope of making the finals up to the second last round but they would finish 5th, 4 points out of the finals.
Melbourne became the first side in A-League history to score 100 goals, reaching the mark after 65 games, with their first goal against [[Wellington Phoenix]] at [[Telstra Dome]] on [[January 11]], 2008.
The 2008 Asian Champions League campaign started with a 2-0 home victory of Korean side Chunnam Dragons but inexperience was to show with the team not able to adapt to the East Asian style and long away trips.
They also became the first A-League team to play against a team from a top European league, losing 4-1 to Juventus at the [[Telstra Dome]] on [[May 30]], 2008. The team was able to compete with the European giants for most of the game, until a late surge of 2 goals in the final minutes lead to a scoreline of 4-1. Juventus managers commended Melbourne Victory on their efforts.

===A-League 08/09===

The 2008/09 season will bring the start of the A-League Youth League and the introdution of the W-League of which Melbourne will field teams in both competitions. Melbourne has again be actively recruiting bring in Socceroo [[Michael Thwaite]], Costa Rican World Cup player [[José Luis López Ramírez]] as well as [[Ney Fabiano de Oliveira]] from Asian Champions League revials [[Chonburi FC]].

Melbourne's season got off to the best possible start, with the Victory winning the [[2008 A-League Pre-Season Challenge Cup|Pre-Season Challenge Cup]] for the first time, winning a penalty shoot-out 8 goals to 7 against the {{ALeague WP}}, after the final ended in a 0 - 0 draw.

After grabbing the Pre-Season Cup, the Victory were held to a 0-0 draw away against [[Sydney FC]].  However, they have been able to cruise to 4-2 and 5-0 victories against [[Wellington Phoenix]] and the [[Newcastle Jets]] respectively to maintain their status as league favourites.

==Corporate==
Geoff Lord and his partners have become the sole owners of Melbourne after buying out the shares held by Football Federation Australia.

Victory struggled to raise the initial $5 million equity capital to join the A-League three years ago and the FFA helped the club over the line by contributing franchise and set-up fees of about $500,000. 

The FFA took a 10 per cent holding in the club in return, as well as having a representative on the Victory board. 

The shareholding was offered back to the club in 2007 and Lord and his partners -- including Ron Peck, Richard Wilson and John Harris -- raised the money to buy the shares.  

The ownership of the club is structured as such:
* [[Geoff Lord]] - 50%
* Private Investors - 50%

===Sponsors===
On [[October 27]] [[2005]], [[South Korean]] electronics giant [[Samsung Group|Samsung]] became the club's major sponsor in a two year deal. This would ensure that Samsung would have their logo feature on the front and the back of Victory's home and away kits. Prior to the [[A-league 2006-07|2006-07]] season [[KFC]] announced they would also be one of Victory's shirt sponsor's, with their logo appearing on the sleeve of Victory's home and away kits.

==Colours and badge==
Melbourne's kit colours are navy blue, silver and white, which encompass the traditional state sporting colours of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. In the first [[A-League]] season, only the club badge displayed a [[Chevron (insigne)|chevron]], known colloquially as the "Big V", a symbol traditionally used by the [[Victoria Australian rules football team]]. In the 2006-07 season the away strip was changed to a grey jersey with a white chevron on the front. This was an immediate hit with the club's supporters, and from the 2007-08 season onwards the Melbourne's home jersey also sported the white chevron on the front.

A new kit was introduced for the [[AFC Champions League 2008|2008 AFC Champions League]] due to AFC rules requiring kits to have player numbers on the front of the uniform as well as the back, which would not fit well with the 'V' on the Victory's regular kit.

==Stadium==
[[Image:Aleaguefinal3.jpg|right|thumb|350px|2006-07 A-League Grand Final at Telstra Dome]]
{{see|Telstra Dome|Olympic Park Stadium|Melbourne Rectangular Stadium}}

Melbourne were originally based at the aging [[Olympic Park Stadium|Olympic Park]] stadium, where they played all home matches during the [[A-League 2005-06|2005-06 A-League season]].  This stadium has seated areas only on the wings, with standing-room sandy terraces on the north and south ends.

On the back of a then-record regular season attendance of 39,730 at the all-seater [[Telstra Dome]] for the match against [[Sydney FC]] on [[September 2]] [[2006]], it was announced that seven home matches would be moved to "the Dome". Only one match (due to a [[Robbie Williams]] concert) —- against the struggling [[New Zealand Knights]] —- would remain at [[Olympic Park, Melbourne|Olympic Park]].

This move to such a large stadium was viewed with skepticism by many, but proved to be an outstanding success, with the average attendance rising to over 27,000 during the season.  However, some of the Victory's active supporter groups have little affection for "The Dome", citing over-zealous security restrictions for hampering their efforts on match day. 

Prior to the 06-07 season the club had planned to move to a new stadium being built to the east of the current Olympic Park complex.  The new [[Melbourne Rectangular Stadium]] was originally expected to seat approximately 20,000 spectators (expandable to 25,000) and was to be completed in time for the start of the 2008-09 campaign. 

These plans have since been revised after the Victory refused to commit to playing at such a small capacity stadium.  On [[May 23]] [[2007]], the club announced it had signed as a founding co-tenant of the Melbourne Rectangular Stadium, which would now be built to accommodate a maximum of 31,000 spectators with further renovations to 50,000 possible.

Telstra Dome will continue to serve as the club's home ground until the completion of the Melbourne Rectangular Stadium. The club will split its home games between the new stadium and the Telstra Dome from the 2009-10 A-League campaign; the games of less importance or potential drawing power at the new stadium and the 'blockbusters' and finals matches at the Telstra Dome. This decision has left a large amount of fans with a bitter taste in their mouth as it means they will never see their team play against arch rivals Sydney FC or Adelaide United at what many regard as Melbourne's true home ground.

==Rivalry==
Rivalry exists between [[Sydney FC]] and [[Adelaide United]]. Victory have recorded big wins against Adelaide (6-0 in the 2006-7 Grand Final) and Sydney (5-0 during the 05-06 Season).

Sydney is considered Melbourne's major rival, due to Melbourne and Sydney being Australia's two largest cities (see [[Melbourne-Sydney rivalry]]). Matches between the two teams are regularly controversial and bitter encounters. Strong tensions are also emerging between the supporters from opposing teams, evident in the sell-out crowds, and Melbourne's regular large travelling group of away supporters. 

Adelaide is Melbourne's geographical rival as it is the closest team to Melbourne in Australia.

== Supporters ==
Melbourne is the only A-League team based in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and have a dedicated fan base — the club have consistently set records for A-League attendances. With the move to Telstra Dome during the 2006/07 season, large crowds have been a feature of Victory home games.  On [[February 18]], [[2007]], a capacity crowd of 55,436 attended the Grand Final against [[Adelaide United]] at the Telstra Dome.  This is the largest attendance on record for a domestic football match in Australia, surpassing the previous record of 50,333 set at the same venue earlier in the season in a match against [[Sydney F.C.]], recorded as the current record Australian Domestic regular season attendance.

Melbourne has a number of supporter groups, each group with its own style of support. The biggest and most notable group of fans are the ultras group the Blue and White Brigade (a.k.a BWB), who situate themselves on either level 1 or level 3 of Telstra Dome, and the SDC (Southern Death Crew) based in the south end.  These British style supporters generally stand at the North End of Telstra Dome, however it's referred to as the 'South End' because of the tradition started by the SDC and affiliates at the South-End terrace of [[Olympic Park, Melbourne|Olympic Park]].
