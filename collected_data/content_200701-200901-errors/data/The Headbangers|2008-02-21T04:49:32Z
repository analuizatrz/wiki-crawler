'''The Headbangers''' were the [[tag team]] of [[Charles Warrington|Mosh]] and [[Glen Ruth|Thrasher]], whose most notable matches were in the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF). As the name of the team implied, their [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] was that they were a pair of [[headbanging|headbangers]], complete with [[Heavy metal (music)|heavy metal]] related T-shirts, piercings, shaved heads, and black [[face paint]].

==History==
===1996-1998===
The team debuted on WWF television wearing [[nun]]s' clothing and billed as the Flying Nuns, Sister Angelica and Mother Smucker. On an episode of ''[[WWF Shotgun Saturday Night|Shotgun Saturday Night]]'', [[Bruce Prichard|Brother Love]] showed up to manage the Nuns. After the Nuns defeated the [[The Godwinns]], Love renamed them the Sisters of Love.<ref name=wwf1997>{{cite web|title=1997|work=The History of WWE|url=http://www.angelfire.com/wrestling/cawthon777/97.htm|accessdate=2008-01-03}}</ref> The gimmick was short-lived, but they kept the skirts when they became The Headbangers in January 1997.<ref name=wwf1997/><ref name=slam>{{cite web|last=Baines|first=Tim|title=Bangers a smash: Eccentric, yes, but WWF tag team caught up in fun|work=SLAM!

Throughout 1997, The Headbangers (initially as [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]], later as [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]]) [[feud (professional wrestling)|feuded]] with The Godwinns, as well as [[Doug Furnas]] & [[Philip Lafond|Phil Lafon]], often finding themselves on the losing end. They faced [[Legion of Doom]] during their surprise return match on February 24 to a double [[Professional wrestling#Countout|count-out]]. At [[WrestleMania 13]], The Headbangers won a [[List of professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|4-way elimination match]] for a shot at the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]]. The team was seen on [[New York]]'s [[WABC-TV]] in June, which re-aired on WWF programming. 

The Headbangers' won the vacant Tag Team title at [[In Your House#In Your House 17: Ground Zero|In Your House 17]] due to [[List of professional wrestling slang#R|run-in interference]] by [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]].<ref name=wwftag>{{cite web|title=W.W.W.F./W.W.F./W.W.E.

The two are seen backstage playing with [[Bret Hart]]'s son, Blade, in the [[1998 in film|1998]] [[documentary film]] ''[[Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows]]''. The footage depicts events from the previous year. 

Both Mosh and Thrasher entered the [[Royal Rumble (1998)|1998 Royal Rumble]] and both lasted over 10 minutes before Mosh was eliminated by [[Kurrgan]] and Thrasher by Steve Austin.<ref>{{cite web|title=WWF Royal Rumble 1998|work=Hoffco Inc.|url=http://www.hoffco-inc.com/wwe/ppv/ppv/rr98.html|accessdate=2008-01-03}}</ref> On [[February 17]] [[1998]], The Headbangers won the [[NWA World Tag Team Championship]] from [[The Rock 'n' Roll Express]] during a WWF program. They feuded with [[The Quebecers]] and the [[Oddities]] throughout the year and become the first [[MCW Tag Team Championship|Maryland Championship Wrestling Tag Team Champions]] on August 18.<ref name=mcw>{{cite web|title=Maryland Championship Wrestling Tag Team Title|work=Wrestling Titles|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/md/mcw/mcw-t.html|accessdate=2008-01-03}}</ref>

===1999-2000===
The Headbangers were both meant to compete in the [[Royal Rumble (1999)|1999 Royal Rumble]] but were injured before the event. Consequently, they were used sparingly throughout 1999. Mosh, repackaged as Beaver Cleavage and then Chaz, performed in singles competition and began having problems with his on-screen girlfriend, [[Marianna Komlos]].<ref name=owwchaz/> He was [[kayfabe]] arrested on an episode of ''[[WWE Heat|Sunday Night Heat]]'' in September after Komlos claimed he [[Spousal abuse|hit her]].<ref name=owow/><ref name=owwchaz/> After Chaz's match on October 5, Glen Ruth (Thrasher) showed GTV footage of Mariana applying makeup to create the effect of wounds.<ref name=owow/><ref name=wwf1999>{{cite web|title=1999|work=The History of WWE|url=http://www.angelfire.com/wrestling/cawthon777/99.htm|accessdate=2008-01-03}}</ref> This proved her accusations false, and The Headbangers subsequently reunited. They then took on a gimmick where they dressed as the opponents that they feuded with, such as the [[Dudley Boyz]] and [[Mean Street Posse]]. The duo later turned heel and began to dress in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]], most notably wearing breast cones.

Mosh entered in the [[Royal Rumble (2000)|2000 Royal Rumble]] alone;<ref>{{cite web|title=Royal Rumble 2000|work=Pro Wrestling History|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/rumble.html#00|accessdate=2008-01-03}}</ref> however, The Headbangers continued performing in tag team and singles matches.<ref name=wwf2000>{{cite web|title=2000|work=The History of WWE|url=http://www.angelfire.com/wrestling/cawthon777/00.htm|accessdate=2008-01-03}}</ref> Both men participated in the [[WWE Hardcore Championship|Hardcore]] [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]] at [[WrestleMania 2000]] where Thrasher held the title for [[List of WWE Hardcore Championship reigns by length|43 seconds]].<ref>{{cite web|title=W.W.F./W.W.E.

Glen Ruth was released from WWF in 2000 and performed [[independent circuit|independently]] briefly before retiring. Charles Warrington (Mosh) was released from WWF in July 2001 and continues to perform occasionally at [[Florida]] shows.<ref name=owwchaz>{{cite web|title=Wrestler Profiles: Chaz Warrington|work=Online World of Wrestling|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/c/chaz.html|accessdae=2008-01-03}}</ref>

===WWE taking shots at The Headbangers===
[[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] has taken shots at The Headbangers. Two examples of this are back in June 2007 when WWE released a special magazine about the history of champions, they had a section in the magazine ripping into people who should not have won a certain belt. For example [[Maven Huffman|Maven]] winning [[WWE Hardcore Championship|the Hardcore Championship]] stating that there was nothing hardcore about [[Maven Huffman|Maven]]. WWE had The Headbangers in this section ripping into The Headbangers' [[World Tag Team Championship| Tag Team Championship]] reign talking about how bad the title reign was.

Recently in WWE's RAW 15th Anniversary magazine WWE decides to take another shot on The Headbangers having a list of 15 superstars who "overstayed" their welcomes putting The Headbangers at number 2, infront of [[Christy Hemme]] (number 3)and behind [[Scott Steiner]](number 1), [[Maven Huffman|Maven]] also made the list at number 6.
