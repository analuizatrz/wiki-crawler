{{nihongo|'''''Otowa'''''|音羽}} was a 3rd class [[protected cruiser]] of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], designed and built by the [[Yokosuka Naval Arsenal]] in [[Japan]]. The name ''Otowa'' comes from a mountain in [[Kyoto]], located behind [[Kiyomizu-dera]]. The waters from a waterfall at this temple were traditionally held to be a cure for all illnesses.

==Background==
Authorized under the 2nd Naval Expansion Program of 1897, ''Otowa'' was originally intended to be the third vessel in the {{sclass|Niitaka|cruiser}} series. However, due to budget constraints, ''Otowa'' was redesigned with 10 percent smaller [[displacement]], and with considerably lighter weaponry. The ship was completed in less than 20 months; its rapid construction time set a new record for Japan. 

''Otowa'' was the first ship to be equipped with the Japanese-designed Kampon water-tube boiler which developed 227 psi compared to the 213 psi pressure of the previous Niclausse boilers in the ''Niitaka''-class. The vertical [[triple expansion steam engine]]s were identical to those of the ''Niitaka''-class with a slight increase in power. It was intended that lack of armor and armament in ''Otowa'' be partially offset by higher speed, but in fact ''Otowa'' was only very slightly faster than the ''Niitaka''-class cruisers. 

==Service record==
''Otowa'' was rushed into service in order to participated in the [[Russo-Japanese War]], joining the Japanese fleet blockading Port Arthur, and later joining the 3rd squadron of the [[IJN 2nd Fleet|2nd Fleet]] in the crucial [[Battle of Tsushima]].

On [[28 August]] [[1912]] it was re-designated as a 2nd class cruiser. 

During [[World War I]], ''Otowa'' fought at the [[Battle of Tsingtao]], and was subsequently assigned to patrol the sea lanes between [[Singapore]], [[Polynesia]] and the [[Philippines]] from its forward base at [[Manila Bay]] against the [[Kaiserliche Marine|Imperial German Navy]], as part of the Japanese contribution to the Allied side under the [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance]]. 

During the mutiny of Indian troops against the British in Singapore in February 1915, ''Otowa'' was the first ship to respond to the British government's request for assistance.

On [[25 July]] [[1917]], when in route from Yokosuka to [[Sasebo, Nagasaki|Sasebo]], ''Otowa'' ran aground off [[Daiozaki]], [[Shima Province|Shima]] peninsula, [[Mie prefecture]] ({{coord|34|14|N|136|53|E}}). Subsequent efforts to save the vessel failed, and it broke apart and sank on [[10 August]] [[1917]].
