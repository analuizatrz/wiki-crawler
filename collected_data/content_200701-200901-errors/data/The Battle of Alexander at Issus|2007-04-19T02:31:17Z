'''''The Battle of Alexander at Issus''''' is arguably [[Albrecht Altdorfer]]'s (c. 1480 near [[Regensburg]] – [[February 12]] [[1538]] in Regensburg) most famous painting.<ref name="mus">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/altdorfer/battle-issus/|title=Web Museum|accessmonthday=9 April|accessyear=2007}}</ref> Painted in [[1529]], the [[oil painting]]<ref name="brit">{{Cite web|url=http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/art-8321|title=Encyclopaedia Brittanica (Concise)|accessmonthday=9 April|accessyear=2007}}</ref>  depicts a young [[Alexander the Great]] in [[333 BC]], claiming victory over the [[Persia]]n army of [[Darius III of Persia|King Darius III]] in the [[Battle of Issus]]. The work now resides in the [[Alte Pinakothek]] in [[Munich]].<ref name="mus" /><ref name="brit" />

==Background information==
Albrecht Altdorfer is considered by most to be the first true [[landscape art|landscape]] painter and [[etching|copperplate etcher]].<ref name="mus" /><ref name="brit" /> He was also an [[architect]], an [[engraving|engraver]], and a high-ranking member of the [[Danube school|Danube School of German art]].<ref name="mus" />
He was also known as something of a near contemporary of [[Albrecht Dürer]], and [[Matthias Grünewald|Grünewald]]'s (a man who is known to have had an impact on Altdorfer) ''[[Heavenly Host above the Virgin and Child]]'' in the [[Isenheim Altarpiece]] has been compared to ''The Battle of Alexander at Issus'', because they both seem to be related to the heavens or the stars. This is shown in ''The Battle of Alexander at Issus'' by the strange night sky.<ref name="mus" />

Altdorfer is most remembered for the [[sacred art|religious scenes]] and backgrounds in his paintings, and was one of the first to paint 'pure' scenes and images of landscapes and such. So when Altdorfer completed the ''Battle of Issus'', it was rather atypical in contrast to his previous paintings, and presented quite a violent change from what he had become renowned for. Despite this, the painting has become among &ndash; perhaps foremost among &ndash; his most famous works.<ref name="mus" />

===The Battle of Issus===
The city of [[Issus]] was located in southeast [[Asia Minor]], close to where [[Iskenderum]], [[Turkey]] is situated today.<ref name="mus" /> Even though the battle took place in Turkey, in the painting the [[Alps]] and what are obviously [[Germany|German]] cities can be clearly defined,<ref name="mus" /> so there was a degree of historical inaccuracy on Altdorfer's part. The battle itself was known to have been claimed fairly easily by the Macedonian force, with a casualty comparison of 7,000 of Alexander the Great's Macedonian army (of which comprised an estimated 16%) and 30,000 deaths in Darius III's Persian army.

==Painting==
It is important to note that, because of the incorrect setting of the painting (being obviously painted to reflect a German setting, where the real battle was actually held in Turkey), it is only really possible to tell which battle or war is meant to be shown by reading the strange sign hanging down from the sky in the painting, or the texts and inscriptions on the banners of the soldiers.<ref name="mus"/>

===Characteristics and analysis of the painting===
Altdorfer has attempted to keep in line with the historical reports on the number of soldiers present at the battle in question, and has tried to implant this in the work by painting from a [[bird's-eye view]]. This creates an effect where as the two armies simply become a mass of people, and the two opposing forces cannot be told apart.
While he has done this, the [[armour]] that most or all of the soldiers are clad in are unmistakably that of the 16th century.<ref name="mus" /> The fortified city seen in the distance is also of a similar time period to that of Altdorfer's, instead of the ancient year of 333 BC.

The scene is, by some, considered to be related to the [[cosmos]] intimately, because of the tumultuous sky above the icy mountains and the human skirmishing.<ref name="mus" /> The painting is also admired for its well-presented and dramatic battle-scene, and the landscape used.<ref name="brit" />
