The '''Battle for Henderson Field''', also known as the '''Battle of Henderson Field''', took place October 23–26, [[1942]], and was a land, sea, and air [[battle]] of the [[Pacific War|Pacific campaign]] of [[World War II]], between the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Navy]] and [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] (mainly [[United States Marine Corps|United States (U.S.) Marine]] and [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]) forces.  The battle was the third of three separate major land offensives by the Japanese in the [[Guadalcanal campaign]].

In the battle, U.S. Marine and Army forces, under the overall command of U.S. [[Major General]] [[Alexander Vandegrift]], successfully repulsed an attack by the [[Japanese 17th Army]], under the command of Japanese [[Lieutenant General]] [[Harukichi Hyakutake]].  The U.S. forces were defending the Lunga perimeter, which guarded [[Henderson Field (Guadalcanal)|Henderson Field]] on Guadalcanal, that was captured from the Japanese by the Allies in landings on Guadalcanal on August 7, 1942.  Hyakutake's force was sent to Guadalcanal in response to the Allied landings with the mission of recapturing the airfield and driving the Allied forces off of the island.  Hyakutake's soldiers conducted numerous assaults over three days at various locations around the Lunga perimeter but all were repulsed with heavy losses for the Japanese attackers.  At the same time, Allied aircraft operating from Henderson Field successfully defended against attacks on Guadalcanal by Japanese naval air and sea forces.

The battle was the last serious ground offensive conducted by Japanese forces on Guadalcanal.  After an attempt to deliver further reinforcements failed during the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]] in November, 1942, Japan conceded defeat in the struggle for the island and successfully evacuated its remaining forces by the first week of February, 1943.

==Background==
On [[August 7]], [[1942]], Allied forces (primarily U.S.) landed on Guadalcanal, [[Tulagi]], and [[Florida Islands]] in the [[Solomon Islands]].  The landings on the islands were meant to deny their use by the Japanese as [[Military base|bases]] for [[threat]]ening the [[materiel|supply]] routes between the U.S. and [[Australia]], and secure the islands as starting points for a [[Military campaign|campaign]] with the eventual goal of isolating the major Japanese base at [[Rabaul]] while also supporting the Allied [[New Guinea campaign|New Guinea]] campaign.  The landings initiated the six-month-long [[Guadalcanal campaign]].<ref>Hogue, ''Pearl Harbor to Guadalcanal'', p. 235-236.</ref>

==Battle==
Finally on [[23 October]], with the addition of more troops, the Japanese made another attempt to capture [[Henderson Field (Guadalcanal)|Henderson Field]] from the south of the [[salient]]. The newly arrived [[United States Army|U.S. Army's]] [[U.S. 164th Infantry Regiment|164th Infantry Regiment]] and [[1st Battalion, 7th Marines|1st Battalion]], [[U.S. 7th Marine Regiment|7th Marines]] defended this position, and after a determined battle the attack was finally repulsed after committing the U.S. reserves.

On [[October 25]] Platoon Sergeant [[Mitchell Paige]] and 33 marine riflemen emplaced four water-cooled .30-caliber [[M1917 Browning machine gun|Browning]] [[machine gun]]s on a ridge to defend Henderson Field. By the time the night was over the Japanese 29th Infantry Regiment had lost 553 killed or missing and 479 wounded among its 2,554 men. The Japanese 16th Regiment's losses were not accounted for but the 164th's burial parties handled 975 Japanese bodies. Total American estimates for Japanese casualties on that ridge were 2,200. All the men in Paige's platoon were either killed or wounded during the night of fierce fighting. Paige moved up and down the line placing dead and wounded troops back into foxholes and firing short bursts from each of the four Brownings to deceive the Japanese that a force still held the ridge. Paige was subsequently cited for a [[Medal of Honor]] for his actions that night. 

At dawn of the next day, battalion executive officer Major [[Odell M. Conoley]] reinforced Paige on the hill. It was decided that they would charge the remnants of the two Japanese regiments who were now regrouping. Conoley gathered his resources who consisted of "three enlisted communication personnel, several riflemen, a few company runners who were at the point, together with a cook and a few messmen who had brought food to the position the evening before."
