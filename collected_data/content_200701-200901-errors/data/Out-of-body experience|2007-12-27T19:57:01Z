An '''out-of-body experience''' ('''OBE''' or sometimes '''OOBE'''), is an experience that typically involves a sensation of floating outside of one's body and, in some cases, perceiving one's physical [[human body|body]] from a place outside one's body ([[autoscopy]]). About one in ten people has had an out-of-body experience at some time in their lives{{Fact|date=December 2007}}.  Scientists know little about the phenomenon.<ref name="bbc">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4271018.stm</ref> OBEs are often part of the [[near-death experience]], and reportedly may also lead to [[astral projection]].  It is claimed that OBErs sometimes observe details during an OBE which were unknown to them beforehand.<ref>http://www.near-death.com/experiences/evidence01.html ''People Have NDEs While Brain Dead'' Retrieved Sept 21, 2007</ref>

In some cases the phenomenon appears to occur spontaneously; in others it is associated with a physical or mental trauma, use of [[psychedelic drugs]], or a [[dream]]-like state. It is possible to induce the experience deliberately, for example through visualization while in a relaxed, meditative state. Recent (2007) studies have shown that experiences somewhat similar to OBEs can be induced by direct brain stimulation. Relatively little is known for sure about OBEs.<ref name="bbc"/>  Some of those who experience OBEs may have willed themselves out of their bodies, while others found themselves being pulled from their bodies (usually preceded by a feeling of [[paralysis]]). In other accounts, the feeling of being outside the body was suddenly realized after the fact, and the experiencers saw their own bodies almost by accident.<ref name="oberf">http://www.oberf.org/sobe_stories.htm</ref>

==Types of OBE==
===Initiated during/after sleep===
{{main|Sleep Paralysis}}
OBEs are often initiated through [[lucid dreaming]], though other types of initiation also used. In many cases, people claim to have had an OBE, reported being [[asleep]], on the verge of sleep, or having been asleep shortly before the experience. A large percentage of these cases referred to situations where the sleep was not particularly deep (due to illness, noises in other rooms, emotional stress, exhaustion from overworking, frequent re-awakening, etc.). In most of these cases, the subjects then felt themselves awake; about half them noted a feeling of [[sleep paralysis]].<ref name="oberf"/>
Some subjects report having had an OBE during near death conditions.

There appear to be two common forms of such lucid experiences. The first involves lucid dreaming, where the subject is immersed in unrealistic worlds, or in a modified form of the reality with impossible or inconsistent features. A second experience is of a more physical nature where the environment is consistent with reality; this is often called an etheric or ethereal experience. This type can be frightening, as extremely realistic physical sensations may occur, often including magnetic and vibrating phenomena, loss of balance, and confusion. The person believes he has awoken physically and panic can be caused by the realization that limbs appear to be penetrating objects.

The OBE may or may not be followed by other experiences which are self-reported as being "as real" as the OBE feeling; alternatively, the subject may fade into a state self-reported as dreaming, or they may wake completely. The OBE is sometimes ended due to a fearful feeling of getting "too far away" from the body. Many end with a feeling of suddenly "popping" or "snapping" and sometimes a "pulling" back into their bodies; some even report being "sucked back" into physical form.  A majority describe the end of the experience by saying "then I woke up". However it's worth noting that even those who describe the experience as something fantastic that occurs during sleep, and who describe the end of the experience by saying "and then I woke up", are very specific in describing the experience as one which was clearly ''not'' a dream; many described their sense of feeling more awake than they felt when they were normally awake. One compared the experience to that of lucid dreaming, but said that it was "more real".

People often report having these experiences after suffering from traumatic experiences such as motor vehicle accidents. They are able to recall the accident as if observing from a location outside the vehicle.

===Induced OBEs===
Some people have attempted to develop techniques to induce OBEs:

* Attempting to fall asleep without losing [[wakefulness]]. This method is generally believed to be what causes involuntary OBEs. Inventor [[Thomas Edison]] was known to use the sleep state to tackle problems while working on his inventions. He would hold a rock above a metal bucket while sitting in a chair, and let himself fall asleep. This would cause the rocks to fall into the bucket and wake him up.{{Fact|date=October 2007}} Deliberately teetering between awake and asleep states is known to cause spontaneous trance episodes at the onset of sleep which are ultimately helpful when attempting to induce an out-of-body experience, as reported by [[Robert Monroe]] and Robert Peterson.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}

* Deep trance and [[visualization]]. The types of visualizations vary; some common imageries used include climbing a rope to "pull out" of one's body, floating out of one's body, getting shot out of a cannon, and other similar approaches. This technique is considered hard to use for people who cannot properly relax. Common sensations can arise such as deep vibrations, impressions of very high heart rate (when it actually is in a relaxed state) and these sensations are likely to cause anxieties. A good example of such a technique consists of the popular "[[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|Golden Dawn]] Body of Light Technique".{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

* Audio/visual stimulation intended to bring the subject into the appropriate state.{{Fact|date=December 2007}} The use of [[binaural beats]] to induce theta [[brain wave]] frequencies was observed as effective by the Monroe institute (and corroborated by others). Another popular technology uses sinusoidal wave pulses to achieve similar results. The beta/theta simultaneous brainwave patterns were also observed as effective, apparently easing the lighter sleep condition. The theta frequency is observed monitoring brains of dreaming patients, notably in REM ([[Rapid eye movement sleep|Rapid Eye Movement]]) sleep, while the beta frequency range is that of normal, relaxed awakened individuals. It is believed that one of the unsuspected powers of the drumming of the American natives during religious ceremonies caused the brain to shift among frequencies to become more receptive to the "other worlds" using similar means.  See [[Brainwave synchronization]].

* Chemically induced experiences. OBEs induced with [[recreational drug use|drug]]s are generally considered to be [[hallucination]]s (i.e., purely subjective), even by those who believe the phenomenon to be objective in general. There are several types of drugs that can initiate an OBE, primarily the [[dissociative]] [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deleriants|hallucinogen]]s such as [[ketamine]], [[dextromethorphan]] (DM or DXM),  and [[phencyclidine]] (PCP). It has also been reported under the influence of tryptamine psychedelics including [[dimethyltryptamine]] (DMT), and [[ayahuasca]]. Being under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs are commonly referred to as being in a [[psychedelic]] state.  
* [[Methamphetamine]] has also been known to cause OBEs, not in itself but through lack of sleep. It has been reported that it felt like the person was talking above and behind them and, being under the influence of the drug, had no idea what was happening.
* Magnetic stimulation of the brain, as with the [http://www.shaktitechnology.com/ helmet] developed by Michael Persinger.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}
* Electrical stimulation of the [[brain]], particularly the [[temporoparietal junction]] (See below).
* [[Sensory deprivation]] or [[sensory overload]]. Various techniques aim to cause intense disorientation of the subject by making him lose his space and time references.{{Fact|date=December 2007}} The first technique, attempting to fall asleep without losing consciousness, can be considered to be a passive form of [[sensory deprivation]]. The brain tends to fill in the gaps when there is nothing getting into the senses for some time. [[Sensory overload]] consists of the opposite, where the subject can for instance be rocked for a long time in a specially designed [[cradle]], or submit to light forms of torture, to cause the brain to shut itself off from all sensory input. Both conditions tend to cause confusion and this disorientation often permits the subject to experience vivid, ethereal out-of-body experiences. This tends to happen when the subject believes he or she is in a particular position, whereas his or her actual body is either rocking in a cradle actively, or still lying down. Consciousness suddenly transfers to the mental body.
* Some people who practice [[BDSM]] desire to be placed in extreme bondage ([[Mummification (BDSM)|mummification]]) because it may allow them to have an out-of-body experience. These experiences have been reported by some people placed in extreme bondage. It is worth noting that being placed in extreme bondage is like being placed in a sensory deprivation tank, and that the OBE may be induced by the resulting sensory deprivation.{{Fact|date=August 2007}} 
* [[Galantamine]] is a [[Nootropic]] that can increase the odds of success when using along with Out-of-body experience or [[Lucid dream]] induction technique. <ref name=Yuschak2006>{{cite book | author = Thomas Yuschak | title = Advanced Lucid Dreaming | edition = 1st ed. | publisher = Lulu Enterprises | year = 2006 |isbn = 978-1-4303-0542-2 }}</ref> <ref name=Yuschak2007>{{cite book | author = Thomas Yuschak | title = Pharmacological Induction of Lucid dreams | year = 2007 | url = http://www.advancedld.com/f/Pharmacological_Induction_of_Lucid_Dreams.pdf}}</ref>  <ref name=LaBerge2004>{{cite web | title= Substances that enhance recall and lucidity during dreaming | work=Stephen LaBerge - US Patent | url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/20040266659.html | accessdate=2007-10-29}}</ref>
* In  some cases, extreme physical effort can induce an OOB. For example, one running in a marathon could overwork themselves and feel "extraordinarily weightless" and actually see themselves from above. Many times this is related to dehydration.{{Fact|date=December 2007}}

===Near-death experiences===
{{main|Near-death experience}}
Another form of a spontaneous OBE occurs during a near death experience (INDEE or NDE). The [[phenomenology]] of an NDE usually includes physiological, psychological and transcendental factors (Parnia, Waller, Yeates & Fenwick, 2001) such as impressions of being outside the physical body (an out-of-body experience), visions of deceased relatives and religious figures, transcendence of ego and spatiotemporal boundaries and other transcendental experiences (Lukoff, Lu & Turner, 1998; Greyson, 2003). Typically the experience follows a distinct progression, starting with the sensation of floating above one's body and seeing the surrounding area, followed by the sensation of passing through a tunnel, meeting deceased relatives, and concluding with encountering a being of light (Morse, Conner & Tyler, 1985).

==Scientific studies of OBEs==
The first extensive scientific study of OBEs was made by [[Celia Green]] (1968).<ref name="Green1968">Green, C.E. (1968). ''Out-of-the-Body Experiences''. London: Hamish Hamilton.</ref>  She collected written, first-hand accounts from a total of 400 subjects, recruited by means of appeals in the mainstream media, and followed up by questionnaire. Her purpose was to provide a [[taxonomy]] of the different types of OBE, viewed simply as an anomalous perceptual experience or [[hallucination]], while leaving open the question of whether some of the cases might incorporate information derived by [[extrasensory perception]]. 

Previous collections of cases had been made by Dr Robert Crookall; however, he had approached the subject from a spiritualistic position, and collected his cases predominantly from spiritualist newspapers such a Psychic News, which appears to have biased his results in various ways.  For example, the majority of his subjects reported ‘seeing’ a cord connecting their ‘external’ body to their physical body; whereas Green found that less than 4% of her subjects noticed anything of this sort, and some 80% reported feeling they were a ‘disembodied consciousness’, with no external body at all.

===Neurology and OBE-like experiences===
There are several possible physiological explanations for parts of the OBE.  OBE-like experiences have been induced by stimulation of the brain and by using cameras to fool the mind into thinking that the body is somewhere it is not.  The OBE has been reproduced through stimulation of the posterior part of the right superior temporal gyrus in a patient<ref>De Ridder D, Van Laere K, Dupont P, Menovsky T, Van de Heyning P. Visualizing out-of-body experience in the brain. N Engl J Med. 2007 Nov 1;357(18):1829-33. </ref>. Positron-emission tomography was also used in this study to identify brain regions affected by this stimulation. 

English psychologist [[Susan Blackmore]] suggests that an OBE begins when a person loses contact with sensory input from the body while remaining conscious.{{Fact|date=August 2007}} The person retains the illusion of having a body, but that perception is no longer derived from the senses. The perceived world may resemble the world he or she generally inhabits while awake, but this perception does not come from the senses either. The vivid body and world is made by our brain's ability to create fully convincing realms, even in the absence of sensory information. This process is witnessed by each of us every night in our dreams, though OBEs are claimed to be far more vivid than even a [[lucid dream]].

====Olaf Blanke studies====
Research by Olaf Blanke in Switzerland found that it is possible to reliably elicit experiences somewhat similar to the OBE by stimulating regions of the brain called the right temporal-parietal junction (TPJ; a region where the [[temporal lobe]] and [[parietal lobe]] of the brain come together).  Blanke and his collaborators in Switzerland have explored the neural basis of OBEs by showing that they are reliably associated with [[lesions]] in the right TPJ region<ref name="Blanke2004">Blanke, O., Landis, T., Spinelli, L., & Seeck, M. (2004). Out-of-body experience and autoscopy of neurological origin. ''Brain'', 127(Pt 2), 243-258.</ref> and that they can be reliably elicited with electrical stimulation of this region in a patient with epilepsy.<ref name="Blanke2002">Blanke, O., Ortigue, S., Landis, T., & Seeck, M. (2002). Stimulating illusory own-body perceptions. ''Nature'', 419(6904), 269-270.</ref>  These elicited experiences may include perceptions of transformations of the patient's arm and legs (complex somatosensory responses) and whole-body displacements (vestibular responses).<ref>Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience at Ecole Polytechnique Federeale de Lausanne: http://lnco.epfl.ch/</ref><ref>Out-of-Body Experiences: All in the Brain? By Jan Holden, EdD, Jeff Long, MD, and Jason MacLurg, MD ''Vital Signs'' Volume 21, Number 3</ref>

In neurologically normal subjects, Blanke and colleagues then showed that the conscious experience of the self and body being in the same location depends on [[multisensory integration]] in the TPJ. Using [[event-related potential]]s, Blanke and colleagues showed the selective activation of the TPJ 330-400 ms after stimulus onset when healthy volunteers imagined themselves in the position and visual perspective that generally are reported by people experiencing spontaneous OBEs. [[Transcranial magnetic stimulation]] in the same subjects impaired mental transformation of the participant’s own body.  No such effects were found with stimulation of another site or for imagined spatial transformations of external objects, suggesting the selective implication of the TPJ in mental imagery of one's own body.<ref name="Blanke2005">Blanke, O., Mohr, C., Michel, C. M., Pascual-Leone, A., Brugger, P., Seeck, M., et al. (2005). Linking out-of-body experience and self processing to mental own-body imagery at the temporoparietal junction. ''Journal of Neuroscience'', 25(3); doi:10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2612-04.2005.[http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/full/25/3/550]
</ref>  In a follow up study, Arzy et al. showed that the location and timing of brain activation depended on whether mental imagery is performed with mentally embodied or disembodied self location.  When subjects performed mental imagery with an embodied location, there was increased activation of a region called the "extrastriate body area" (EBA), but when subjects performed mental imagery with a disembodied location, as reported in OBEs, there was increased activation in the region of the TPJ.  This leads Arzy et al. to argue that "these data show that distributed brain activity at the EBA and TPJ as well as their timing are crucial for the coding of the self as embodied and as spatially situated within the human body."<ref name="Arzy2006">Arzy, S., Thut, G., Mohr, C., Michel, C. M., & Blanke, O. (2006). Neural basis of embodiment: Distinct contributions of temporoparietal junction and extrastriate body area. ''Journal of Neuroscience'', 26(31), 8074-8081.</ref>

Blanke and colleagues thus propose that the right temporal-parietal junction is important for the sense of spatial location of the self, and that when these normal processes go awry, an OBE arises.<ref name="BlankeArzy">Blanke, O., & Arzy, S. (2005). The out-of-body experience: Disturbed self-processing at the temporo-parietal junction. ''Neuroscientist'', 11(1), 16-24</ref>

In August 2007 Blanke's lab published research in ''Science'' demonstrating that conflicting visual-somatosensory input in [[virtual reality]] could disrupt the spatial unity between the self and the body. During multisensory conflict, participants felt as if a virtual body seen in front of them was their own body and mislocalized themselves toward the virtual body, to a position outside their bodily borders. This indicates that spatial unity and bodily self-consciousness can be studied experimentally and is based on multisensory and cognitive processing of bodily information.<ref name = "Lenggenhager">Lenggenhager et al. 2007. Video Ergo Sum: Manipulating Bodily Self-Consciousness. ''Science'' 317:1096 - 1099 DOI: 10.1126/science.1143439</ref>

====Michael Persinger studies====
[[Michael Persinger]] has undertaken similar research to Olaf Blanke using magnetic stimulation applied to the right [[temporal lobe]] of the brain, which is known to be involved in visuo-spatial functions, multi-sensory integration and the construction of the sense of the body in space.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCVzz96zKA0 Michael Persinger's research on YouTube] presented by [[Michael Shermer]]</ref> Persinger's research also found evidence for objective neural difference between periods of [[remote viewing]] in two individuals thought to have psychic abilities. Persinger undertook his research on Sean Harribance and [[Ingo Swann]], a renowned remote viewer who has taken part in numerous studies.<ref name="Persinger">Persinger, Michael M. (2001). The neuropsychiatry of paranormal experiences ''Neuropsychiatric Practice and Opinion'', 13(4), 521-522.</ref>  Examination of Harribance showed enhanced [[electroencephalography|EEG]] activity within the alpha band (8 - 12 Hz) over Harribance's right parieto-occipital region, consistent with neuropsychological evidence of early brain trauma in these regions.  In a second study, Ingo Swann was asked to draw images of pictures hidden in envelopes in another room.  Individuals with no knowledge of the nature of the study rated Swann's comments and drawings as congruent with the remotely viewed stimulus at better than chance levels.  Additionally, on trials in which Swann was correct, the duration of 7 Hz (alpha band) [[paroxysmal]] discharges over the right [[occipital lobe]] was longer.  Subsequent anatomical [[MRI]] examination showed anomalous subcortical [[white matter]] signals focused in the perieto-occipital interface of the right hemisphere that were not expected for his age or history.

====Ehrsson study====
In August 2007 [[Henrik Ehrsson]], then at the Institute of Neurology at [[University College of London]] (now at the [[Karolinska Institute]] in Sweden) published research in ''[[Science (magazine)|Science]]'' demonstrating the first experimental method that, according to the scientist's claims in the publication, ''induced'' an out-of-body experience in healthy participants.<ref name = "Ehrsson">Ehrsson, H.H. 2007. The Experimental Induction of Out-of-Body Experiences. ''Science'' 317:1048
DOI: 10.1126/science.1142175</ref> The experiment was conducted in the following way:
<blockquote>The study participant sits in a chair wearing a pair of head-mounted video displays. These have two small screens over each eye, which show a live film recorded by two video cameras placed beside each other two metres behind the participant’s head. The image from the left video camera is presented on the left-eye display and the image from the right camera on the right-eye display. The participant sees these as one ‘stereoscopic’ (3D) image, so they see their own back displayed from the perspective of someone sitting behind them.

The researcher then stands just beside the participant (in their view) and uses two plastic rods to simultaneously touch the participant’s actual chest out-of-view and the chest of the illusory body, moving this second rod towards where the illusory chest would be located, just below the camera’s view.

The participants confirmed that they had experienced sitting behind their physical body and looking at it from that location.<ref name ="Eurekalert">[http://search.eurekalert.org/e3/query.html?qt=out+of+body&col=ev3rel&qc=ev3rel&x=0&y=0 First out-of-body experience induced in laboratory setting], August 23 2007, EurekAlert!</ref></blockquote>

The experiment fits a three-point definition of the out-of-body experience (OBE). The OBE as reported in spontaneous cases can be phenomenologically more complex as commented in ''Slate''<ref name ="Slate">[http://www.slate.com/id/2172694/pagenum/2 The Out-of-Body Electric], August 23 2007, Daniel Engber, Slate</ref> and elsewhere.<ref name ="MedicalNewsToday">[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/youropinions.php?opinionid=21453 First OBE Experiment Was In 1966], September 21 2007, Nelson Abreu, Medical News Today</ref>

==Astral projection==
{{main|Astral projection}}
Astral projection is a [[paranormal]] interpretation of an [[out-of-body experience]] achieved either awake or via [[lucid dreaming]] or deep [[meditation]]. The concept of astral projection assumes the existence of another body, separate from the [[physical body]] and capable of [[traveling]] to non-physical planes of existence. Commonly such planes are called ''astral, [[Etheric body|etheric]]'', or ''[[Spirituality|spiritual]]''.  Astral projection is often experienced as the [[Soul|spirit]] or [[astral body]] leaving the [[Human anatomy|physical body]] to travel in the [[spirit world]] or [[astral plane]].<ref>http://parapsych.org/historical_terms.html  entry on ''Astral body'' in the Historical Terms Glossary from the website of the Parapsychological Association, retrieved August 26, 2007</ref>

Evidence for objective reality of astral projection is sometimes suggested when people, such as patients during surgery, describe OBEs in which they see or hear events or objects outside their sensory range (for instance, one woman reportedly described a surgical instrument she had not seen previously, as well as conversation that occurred while she was clinically dead).<ref>http://www.near-death.com/experiences/evidence01.html ''People Have NDEs While Brain Dead'' Retrieved Sept 21, 2007</ref>

Skeptics such as Susan Blackmore have disputed whether anything leaves the body during an OBE.<ref>{{cite book
