'''Connie Francis''' (born [[December 12]], [[1938]] in [[Newark, New Jersey]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[pop singer]] best known for international hit songs such as "[[Who's Sorry Now?]]", "[[Where The Boys Are]]", and "[[Everybody's Somebody's Fool]]".

==Biography==
Born '''Concetta Rosa Maria Franconero''' in the Italian Down Neck or [[Ironbound]] neighborhood of [[Newark, New Jersey]], she is considered the most prolific and popular female [[rock 'n' roll]] hit-maker of the early rock era -- the late 1950s to the early 1960s. After an appearance on ''[[Startime|Ford Startime]]'', Francis was advised to change her name from Franconero to something more easily pronounceable -- as well as to quit the [[accordion]] and focus on singing.

Francis' first single "Freddy" ([[1955 in music|1955]]) met with little success. Her next nine singles were also failures, and she began to consider a career in medicine. However, a [[cover version]] of the song "[[Who's Sorry Now?]]" ([[1923 in music|1923]]) by [[Bert Kalmar]] and [[Harry Ruby]] launched her into super-stardom worldwide. Francis recorded the song at what was to have been her final recording session for [[MGM]] -- the label was about to drop her due to her previous singles doing poor business. She has said -- paraphrased from ''The Billboard Book of Number One Singles'' by Fred Bronson -- that she recorded it at the suggestion of her father, who convinced her it stood a chance of becoming a hit because it was a song adults already knew and that teenagers would dance to if it were released with a more contemporary arrangement.  

The gamble paid off. In April [[1958 in music|1958]], "Who's Sorry Now" reached No. 1 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] (number four in the USA). In 2000, it was named one of the [[Songs of the Century]]. On January 1, 1958, she debuted it on [[Dick Clark]]'s ''[[American Bandstand]]'' television show, and by mid-year over a million copies were sold. This was followed by many other hits over the next decade, as Connie Francis became one of the most popular vocalists in the world.  

Francis specialized in downbeat ballads delivered in her trademark "sobbing" style -- such as "My Happiness," "I'm Sorry I Made You Cry," "Among My Souvenirs," "Together," "Breakin' In a Brand New Broken Heart," and the [[Italian language|Italian]] song "Mama" -- many of which were remakes of old standards. However, she also had success with a handful of more upbeat, rock-and-roll-oriented compositions, such as "Stupid Cupid", "Lipstick On Your Collar", and "Vacation". 

Among her other notable performances were "In the Summer of His Years" (a tribute to slain U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]]) and [[Bert Kaempfert]]'s "[[Strangers In The Night]]" (although the latter song is more identified with [[Frank Sinatra]]).  Both "[[Everybody's Somebody's Fool]]" and "[[My Heart Has a Mind of Its Own]]" went to No. 1 on the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' music charts in [[1960 in music|1960]]. In [[1962 in music|1962]], she had another No. 1 hit with "[[Don't Break the Heart That Loves You]]". 

[[Image:Connie Francis record.jpg|thumb|left|Connie Francis MGM LP record, 1961]] Francis recorded in thirteen languages during her career: English, German, Swedish, Dutch, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian (and its dialect Neapolitan), Hebrew, Yiddish, Japanese, Latin and Hawaiian. During a live concert in Brazov, [[Romania]] in March 1970 she also performed live in Romanian.

Francis remade many of her hits in foreign languages, including "Everybody's Somebody's Fool" and her [[signature song]], "[[Where the Boys Are]]."  In fact, her biggest hit album in the U.S. was 1960's ''[[Italian Favorites]]'', and she followed it with several more albums of Italian songs over the years, as well as collections of Spanish-language and Jewish songs, among others.

"Where The Boys Are," one of many [[Neil Sedaka]]/[[Howard Greenfield]] compositions Francis recorded during her career (others included "Stupid Cupid" and "Everybody's Somebody's Fool"), gained wide exposure through its inclusion in the [[1960 in film|1960]] [[motion picture]] with the same title.  Francis had a role in the film and sang the title song. During the first half of the 1960s she starred in three additional films -- ''Follow the Boys'' (1963) (the title song of which became a No. 17 Billboard single for Francis), ''Looking for Love'' (1964) and ''When the Boys Meet the Girls'' (1965).

In 1960 Francis became the youngest headliner to sing in [[Las Vegas]], where she played 28 days a year for nine years. In 1961 she was successful in starring in her own television special on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television sponsored by [[Brylcreem]] titled ''Kicking Sound Around'', singing and acting along-side [[Tab Hunter]], [[Eddie Foy Jr.]] and [[Art Carney]]. She appeared on the ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show|Ed Sullivan Show]]'' on July 1, 1962 with French singing star [[Johnny Hallyday]] in a show that was taped at the famous [[Moulin Rouge]] nightclub in [[Paris, France]]. On July 3, 1963 she played a [[Royal Variety Performance|Command performance]] before [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] at the [[Alhambra Theatre]] in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]]. By 1967, she had 35 U.S. Top 40 hits, and three number ones.

Connie Francis has always been a great fan of [[country music]] and recorded several albums of country standards during her pop career.  In 1969 she had a modest country hit with "The Wedding Cake" and made the country charts again in 1982 with "There's Still a Few Good Love Songs Left in Me."  Several country singers found chart success remaking Francis' pop hits for the country market, including [[Marie Osmond]] ("Who's Sorry Now" in 1975), [[Susan Raye]] ("My Heart Has a Mind of Its Own" in 1972), [[Margo Smith]] ("Don't Break The Heart That Loves You" in 1978), and [[Debby Boone]]. 

During the height of the [[Vietnam War]] in 1967, Connie Francis performed for U.S. troops.

Francis ended her recording career in 1969. She returned in 1973 with "The Answer," a song written just for her, and soon began performing again. Her son Joey was born in 1974. 

Tragedies followed soon after. In 1974 she was [[Rape|brutally raped]] for two hours in a [[Howard Johnson's]] hotel following a performance in [[Westbury, New York]], and subsequently sued the motel chain for failing to provide adequate security; she reportedly won a $3 million judgment, at the time one of the largest judgments in history.  She did not perform again for seven years thereafter.<ref>http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0203/11/lkl.00.html</ref> 

Nasal surgery to correct a sensitivity to [[air conditioning]] deprived her of her ability to sing professionally for four years. Her brother was murdered in 1981. 

Francis' [[autobiography]], ''Who's Sorry Now?'' was published in 1984. Francis was diagnosed with [[bipolar disorder]], a mental disease which includes severe depressions and manic highs. She uses the drug [[Lithium pharmacology|Lithium]] to balance out the emotional highs and lows caused by the disease. Connie Francis resumed her career in 1989 after discovering the drug and has continued singing and recording since then. Francis still holds a world-wide appeal shown through continued music sales and sold-out appearances.

Her latest CD ''The American Tour'' contains performances from recent shows. In late December 2004, Francis headlined in Las Vegas for the first time since 1989.

In March 2007, Francis performed to a sold-out crowd -- composed of gay urbanites and conservative suburbanites -- at the [[Castro Theater]] in [[San Francisco]]. The "little diva" belted out versions of her "woebegone ballads . . . in full force," according to the music critic of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', reviewing the Castro show.

==The Two Connies==
She and singer-actress [[Connie Stevens]] are often mistaken for each other.  Both are female Italian-American singers from the greater New York City area who Anglicized their Italian birth name of "Concetta" into "Connie" and their last names into common English names.  Both were born in 1938, and both enjoyed their greatest success on the pop charts in the late 1950's and early 1960's.

==Bio-pic==
The [[screenplay]] for a movie based on Francis' life, titled ''Who's Sorry Now?'' is done, and filming is anticipated in 2007, Latin music star [[Gloria Estefan]] said in a news conference.  Estefan wrote the screenplay and will produce and play the lead.  Estefan said, "She [Francis] isn't in the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], and yet she was the first pop star worldwide, and has recorded in nine languages. She has done a lot of things for victims' rights since her rape in the '70s . . . There's a major story there."  The "long gestating biopic" will begin pre-production within a few months, according to a story published in March 2007 in the San Francisco gay newspaper ''[[Bay Area Reporter]]''.

==Trivia==
*In 1993, [[Channel 4]] screened a [[Dennis Potter]] production called ''[[Lipstick on Your Collar]]'' which featured the Connie Francis song and starred a young [[Ewan McGregor]].
*The ending song in the [[animated series]] ''[[Futurama]]'' episode "[[Jurassic Bark]]" is 'I Will Wait for You' sung by Connie Francis.
*Billboard chart historian [[Joel Whitburn]] ranks Connie Francis as the top female vocalist on the [[Adult Contemporary]] chart during the 1960s.  In 1961, Francis was the first female artist to score a No. 1 Billboard AC single, with "Together," and she topped the AC chart again the following year with "Don't Break the Heart That Loves You." 
*"Connie Francis" is also a character in the [[anime]] series [[Victory Gundam]], one of the five (of the six) original members of the "Shrike Team" who are named in homage to [[20th century]] female singers.
*Her recording of 'Siboney' appears in [[Wong Kar-Wai]]'s [[2046 (film)|2046]].
*According to 1963's ''Movie Life Yearbook'', at the time she was 5'1, 110 lbs, 35-23-35 1/2.
*In the 1999 film, [[Jawbreaker (film)]], her song "Lollipop Lips" is heard during a sex scene. Francis, who found the content of the film objectionable, [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1589/is_2002_April_16/ai_84669421/ filed a lawsuit]
*In the 1996 movie "[[The Craft (film)|The Craft]]," when Nancy and her mother collect insurance from her step-father Ray's fatal heartattack, her mother buys a jukebox that plays nothing but Connie Francis songs.
*During a scene in "[[Trinity and Beyond]]," "Where The Boys Are" is playing to a scene of servicemen having a cookout on the beach.  The scene shifts to them sitting on the beach, looking at the water.  At that point a nuclear weapon is detonated, and the radio turns to static, due to EMP.  The bomb which is detonated high above the Earth, distorts the radio for about 10 seconds, and the song is finishing as the EMP wears off.
