'''Dominik Hašek''' ({{IPA2|'domɪnɪk 'ɦaʃɛk}}) (born [[January 29]], [[1965]]) is a professional [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) [[goaltender]] for the [[Detroit Red Wings]]. In his 15-season NHL career, he has also played for the [[Chicago Blackhawks]], [[Buffalo Sabres]], and the [[Ottawa Senators]]. During his years in Buffalo, he became one of the league's finest goaltenders, earning him the nickname "The Dominator." His strong play has been credited with establishing European goaltenders in a league widely dominated by North Americans.<ref name = "return">{{cite news

Hašek has been one of the league's most successful goaltenders of the 1990s and early 2000s. From [[1992-93 NHL season|1993]] to [[2000-01 NHL season|2001]] he won six [[Vezina Trophy|Vezina Trophies]], and in 1998 he became the first goaltender to win consecutive [[Hart Memorial Trophy|Hart Trophies]].<ref name="azhockey">{{cite web

In the process, he set a record for shutouts in a playoff year.

Hašek is considered an unorthodox goaltender, with a distinct style that has labeled him a "flopper."<ref name="MainBio">{{cite web|url=http://hockeygoalies.org/bio/hasek.html|title=Dominik Hasek (1990–present)|publisher=''hockeygoalies.org''|accessdate=2007-04-24|year=2007}}</ref> He is best known for his concentration, foot speed, flexibility, and unconventional saves, such as covering the puck with his blocker rather than his [[Glove (hockey)|trapper]]. His puckhandling is considered to be his biggest weakness.<ref name="MainBio"/>

Hašek is regarded as a future [[Hockey Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] by those in the hockey world.<ref>{{cite news

==Early life==
Hašek started playing hockey at the age of six in his native [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]]. As he explains:<ref name="flex">{{cite news

In 1981, the 16-year old Hašek joined the top hockey league in the country, playing for his home team [[HC Pardubice]] of the [[Czechoslovak Extraliga]], winning two league titles in 1987 and 1989. The next year, he was drafted by the Czech army to play for [[Dukla Jihlava]]. After making his mark and eventually playing for the Czechoslovakian National team, Hašek entered the NHL draft and was drafted by the Chicago Blackhawks in [[1983 NHL Entry Draft|1983]]. At the time, NHL teams were wary of drafting players from behind the [[Iron Curtain]] who were often unwilling to play in the NHL or barred from doing so by their countries. Consequently, Hašek was picked in the 10th round (199th overall) and was the seventeenth goalie selected. Hašek did not even know he had been drafted until several months later.<ref name="draft">{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=18282|title=Dominik Hasek|publisher=''legendsofhockey.net''|accessdate=2006-08-05}}</ref>
The Blackhawks offered Hašek a contract prior to the 1987–88 season, but he rejected it because at that time he did not feel the desire to leave his home country to play in North America.<ref name="HockeydCentral">{{cite web|url=http://www.hockeydraftcentral.com/1983/83199.html|title=Dominik Hasek Bio at HockeyDraftCentral|publisher=''hockeydraftcentral.com''|accessdate=2007-04-24|year=2007}}</ref>

Until 1990, Hašek played in his native Czechoslovakia for [[HC Pardubice]] and [[HC Jihlava]]. He was named the [[Golden Hockey Stick (Czechoslovakia)|top ice hockey player]] of the Czechoslovak Extraliga in 1987, 1989, and 1990, and Goaltender of the Year from 1986 through 1990.<ref name="TSNprofile">{{cite web|url=http://tsn.ca/nhl/teams/players/bio/?id=126&hubname=nhl-red_wings|title=TSN.ca player profile|publisher=''[[The Sports Network]]''|accessdate=2007-05-14}}</ref> With [[Velvet Revolution|the end of communist rule]] in 1989, the borders of the Soviet Bloc countries opened, allowing Hašek to emigrate to the United States with aspirations of playing in the NHL.<ref name="draft"/> His American career began with the [[Indianapolis Ice]] of the [[International Hockey League (1945-2001)|IHL]], where he played parts of two seasons. His NHL debut with the Blackhawks finally came in the [[1990-91 NHL season|1990–91 season]], eight years after the 1983 NHL Entry Draft.

==NHL career==
In Chicago, Hašek spent time as the backup to [[Ed Belfour]], and played only 25 games over two seasons with the Blackhawks. On [[November 6]], [[1990]], wearing the number 31, Hašek made his first NHL start in a 1–1 tie against the [[Hartford Whalers]].<ref name="detroit page">{{cite web

His first victory came on [[March 8]], [[1991]] in a 5–3 performance over the Buffalo Sabres, and on [[January 9]], [[1992]], he recorded his first shutout in a 2–0 win against the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]].<ref name="detroit page"/>

====Buffalo (1994–1998)====
After a Stanley Cup finals loss to [[Mario Lemieux]] and the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]], Hašek was traded to the Buffalo Sabres for goalie [[Stephane Beauregard]] and future considerations, which later materialized into a draft pick used to obtain [[Eric Daze]]. In Buffalo, wearing number 39, he was initially the backup goaltender, first playing behind [[Tom Draper]] and then [[Grant Fuhr]]. When Fuhr was injured partway through the season, Hašek was elevated to starter, where he soon developed into a top tier goaltender. In [[1993-94 NHL season|1994]], he won his first [[Vezina Trophy]], was runner-up for the [[Hart Trophy]] and shared the [[William M. Jennings Trophy]] with Fuhr. Hašek played 58 games with a league-best 1.95 [[goals against average]] (GAA), seven shutouts, and a .930 [[save percentage]]. He followed this feat by again winning the Vezina Trophy and again placing as a Hart finalist in [[1994-95 NHL season|1995]].

Hašek's continued success in the [[1996-97 NHL season|1996–97 season]] was overshadowed by a conflict with then-head coach [[Ted Nolan]]. The conflict created a tense, clique-like atmosphere in the Sabres' clubhouse.<ref name="rattling">{{cite news

With Steve Shields in goal, the Sabres fought back against the Senators and took the series in seven games. However, Hašek claimed his knee was still injured and did not play in the five-game loss in the following series against the [[Philadelphia Flyers]].

Though General Manager [[John Muckler]] was named "Executive of the Year", he was fired for his constant feuding with Nolan. Hašek, who sided with Muckler, stated in an interview during the 1997 NHL Awards Ceremony that it would be better if Nolan was not rehired.<ref>{{cite news

Despite winning the [[Jack Adams Award]] as top coach and being popular with the Sabres fanbase, Nolan was only offered a one-year contract extension by replacement GM [[Darcy Regier]].

As the season progressed, Hašek played well and won back many fans. He won the Vezina Trophy again, as well as the [[Lester B. Pearson Award]] and the [[Hart Trophy]] for league MVP. He became one the few goaltenders in NHL history to win the Hart, alongside [[Al Rollins]] and [[Jose Theodore]], and Hall of Famers [[Jacques Plante]], [[Chuck Rayner]] and [[Roy Worters]].

Hašek played a career high 72 games in the [[1997-98 NHL season|1997–98 season]], and set a team record with 13 shutouts. Six of these shutouts came in December, which tied the all-time NHL record for most in one month.<ref name="HockeydCentral"/> He again won the Lester B.

He donated the $10,000 prize money after winning the Pearson Award in 1998 to the ''Variety Club of Buffalo''.<ref name="HockeydCentral"/> In the off-season he signed a $26 million deal, the highest goaltender salary contract at that time.<ref>{{cite web|

In [[1998-99 NHL season|1999]], Hašek averaged a career best 1.87 GAA and .937 save percentage, capturing him his third consecutive Vezina, and fifth overall. He was also a finalist for the Hart and Pearson trophies.

The Sabres eventually lost the series four games to two, with the decisive sixth game being one of the longest Stanley Cup playoff games in NHL history. Hašek and Ed Belfour made 50 and 53 saves, respectively, in a sudden-death [[Overtime (ice hockey)|triple-overtime]] duel that only ended when [[Brett Hull]] scored a controversial Cup-winning goal with his foot in the [[Hockey rink#Goal crease|goal crease]].<ref name="HullGoal">{{cite web

However, after Detroit's first round loss to the [[Anaheim Ducks|Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]] in the [[2002-03 NHL season|following season]], he expressed his desire to play again. This created a difficult situation for the Red Wings, who had two years left on [[Curtis Joseph]]'s three-year $24 million contract, which had a no-trade clause. Detroit was also under pressure knowing that the rival Colorado Avalanche would be looking for a goalie to replace [[Patrick Roy]] after his retirement.<ref name="comeback"/> With [[Manny Legacé]] also on the Wings' roster, Detroit now had three potential starting goalies.

In the [[2003-04 Detroit Red Wings season|2003–04 season]] Hašek injured his groin after playing just 14 games. On [[January 9]], he and the team agreed he should rest his injury for two to four weeks. Hašek privately told general manager [[Ken Holland]] that he would not accept any pay while he was injured.

Similar to the tour Wayne Gretzky and [[IMG (business)|IMG]] formed during the [[1994-95 NHL lockout]], the Primus Worldstars Tour ran December 7–23, playing in seven different countries (Riga, Latvia; Moscow and St Petersburg, Russia; Bratislava, Slovakia; Bern, Switzerland; Karlstad, Jonkoping and Linkoping, Sweden; Oslo, Norway; Katowice, Poland) in ten scheduled games.

On [[July 31]], [[2006]], at the age of 41, Hašek joined the Red Wings for the third time. He signed a one-year $750,000 US 
contract, with added bonuses if the team succeeded in the playoffs. He posted 38 wins and a 2.05 GAA while leading the Red Wings to 
the number one seed in the [[Western Conference (NHL)|Western Conference]]. He also broke his own personal record by going 181 minutes and 17 seconds without allowing a goal.<ref>{{cite web

However, Hašek and the Red Wings lost in six games to the Ducks, who eventually defeated the Ottawa Senators for the Stanley Cup.

Hašek contemplated retirement in the 2007 offseason, but on [[July 5]], [[2007]], he signed a one-year contract with Detroit worth $2 million with up to $2 million in bonuses,<ref>{{cite news

In order to cover the bottom of the net, where most goals are scored, Hašek drops down on almost every [[Shot (ice hockey)|shot]]. His "flopping" style is derived from him flailing in the crease, using every part of his body, including his head, to stop the puck. Hašek occasionally drops his stick and covers the puck with his stick hand, whereas most goaltenders would use the glove hand instead.<ref name="MainBio"/>
In response to the speculation he receives from his style, Hašek explained:<ref name="flex"/>

{{h3|Inline hockey game incident}}
During an inline hockey game on [[May 18]], [[2003]], Hašek was accused of assaulting another player. He was playing as a defender for Bonfire Střída when he crosschecked Martin Šíla. The prosecutor in the case, Lenka Strnadová, ruled two months later that there was no evidence that Hašek intended bodily harm and recommended the case be treated as a misdemeanor, punishable only by fine ($95 USD maximum), rather than a felony where jail time would have been possible.<ref>{{cite news

==Legacy==
===Milestones===
Hašek earned his 300th National Hockey League win on [[October 15]], [[2005]], in a 5–1 home victory with the Ottawa Senators over the Boston Bruins. He stopped 34 of 35 shots in the win, and was holding a shutout until Bruins forward [[Pat Leahy (ice hockey)|Pat Leahy]] jammed a loose puck under him three minutes into the third period, becoming the twenty-second goaltender to reach this milestone.<ref name="MainBio"/> He is the oldest goaltender in NHL history to post a 30-win season, and was the first goaltender to ever win the Lester B. Pearson Award in 1997 for most outstanding player in the entire league. He is also the only goaltender to win the Hart Trophy twice for Most Valuable Player, and is only one Vezina Trophy away from tying Jacques Plante's total of seven for most all-time. Hašek's personal best shutout streak is 181 minutes, 17 seconds.
