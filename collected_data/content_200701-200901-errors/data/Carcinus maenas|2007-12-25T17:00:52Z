'''''Carcinus maenas''''' is a common [[littoral]] [[crab]], and an important [[invasive species]]. It is listed among the 100 "world's worst invasive alien species"&nbsp;<ref>{{cite web|title=100 of the World's Worst Invasive Alien Species | url = http://www.issg.org/database/species/search.asp?st=100ss&fr=1&sts= |publisher=Invasive Species Specialist Group}}</ref>.

''C. maenas'' is known by different names around the world. In the [[British Isles]], it is generally referred to simply as the ''shore crab''. In [[North America]] and [[South Africa]], it bears the name ''green crab'' or ''European green crab''. In [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], it is referred to as either the ''European green crab'' or ''European shore crab''.

==Description==
[[Image:Carcinus maenas - Eemian crab borehole Bergen Netherlands.jpg|thumb|left|Fossil ''Carcinus maenas'' remains from the [[Eemian]] age, found in the [[Netherlands]]]]
''C. maenas'' has a [[carapace]] up to 60&nbsp;[[millimetre|mm]] long and 90&nbsp;mm wide&nbsp;<ref name="Yamada">{{cite journal | quotes=no|journal=[[Journal of Shellfish Research]]|volume=20|issue=3|pages=905–9|year=2001|title=Field identification of the European green crab species: ''Carcinus maenas'' and ''Carcinus aestuarii''|author=S. B. Yamada & L. Hauck |url=http://www.sgnis.org/publicat/papers/yamahauc.pdf}}</ref>, with five short teeth along the rim behind each eye, and three undulations between the eyes. The undulations, which do not protrude beyond the eyes are the simplest means of distinguishing ''C. maenas'' from the closely-related ''[[Carcinus aestuarii|C. aestuarii]]'', which can also be an invasive species. In ''C. aestuarii'', the carapace lacks any bumps and extends forward beyond the eyes. The other character for distinguishing the two species is the form of the first and second [[pleopod]]s (collectively the [[gonopod]]s), which are straight and parallel in ''C. aestuarii'', but curve outwards in ''C. maenas''&nbsp;<ref name="Yamada"/>.

The colour of ''C. maenas'' varies greatly, from green to brown, grey or red. This variation has a genetic component but is largely due to local environmental factors&nbsp;<ref>{{cite journal | quotes=no|title=Patterns of morphological and genetic variability in UK populations of the shore crab, ''Carcinus maenas'' Linnaeus, 1758 (Crustacea : Decapoda : Brachyura) |author=J.

In particular, individuals which delay [[ecdysis|moulting]] become red–coloured rather than green. Red individuals are stronger and more [[aggression|aggressive]], but are less tolerant of [[environmental stress]]es, such as low [[salinity]] or [[hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]]&nbsp;<ref>{{cite journal | quotes=no|author=A.

==Native and introduced range==

Black dots represent single sightings that did not lead to invasion, and green areas are the potential range of the species.]]
''C. maenas'' is native to [[Europe]]an and [[North Africa]]n coasts as far as the [[Baltic Sea]] in the east, and [[Iceland]] and central [[Norway]] in the north, and is one of the most common crabs throughout much of its range. In the [[Mediterranean Sea]], it is replaced by the closely-related species ''Carcinus aestuarii''.

''C. maenas'' was first observed on the east coast of [[North America]] in [[Massachusetts]] in 1817, and may now be found from [[Newfoundland]] to [[Virginia]].

In [[Australia]], ''C. maenas'' was first reported in the late [[19th century]], in [[Port Phillip Bay]], [[Victoria (state)|Victoria]]. It has since spread along the coast of Victoria, reaching [[New South Wales]] in 1971, [[South Australia]] in 1976 and [[Tasmania]] in 1993. One specimen was found in [[Western Australia]] in 1965, but ''C. maenas'' has not been seen in the area since&nbsp;<ref name="Thresher">{{cite journal | quotes=no|author=R. Thresher, C. Proctor, G.

''C. maenas'' first reached [[South Africa]] in 1983, in the Table Docks area near [[Cape Town]]&nbsp;<ref>{{cite journal | quotes=no|author=P. J. Le Roux, G. M. Branch & M. A. P.

Since then, it has spread at least as far as [[Saldanha Bay]] in the north and [[Camps Bay]] in the south, over 100&nbsp;[[kilometre|km]] apart.

In 1989, ''C. maenas'' was found in [[San Francisco Bay]], [[California]], on the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast of the [[United States]]. Until 1993, it was not able to extend its range, but reached [[Oregon]] in 1997, the state of [[Washington]] in 1998 and [[British Columbia]] in 1999&nbsp;<ref name="Alaska">{{cite web|url=http://www.pwsrcac.org/docs/d0015300.pdf|title=Non-indigenous aquatic species of concern for Alaska.

In 2003, ''C. maenas'' was discovered in [[Patagonia]]&nbsp;<ref>{{cite journal | quotes=no|author=F. J.

Other appearances that have not, however, led to invasions have been recorded in [[Brazil]], [[Panama]], [[Hawaii]], [[Madagascar]], the [[Red Sea]], [[Pakistan]], [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Myanmar]]; [[Japan]] has been invaded by a related crab, either ''[[Carcinus aestuarii|C. aestuarii]]'' or a [[hybrid]] of ''C. aestuarii'' and ''C. maenas''&nbsp;<ref>{{cite journal | quotes=no |title=Episodic global dispersal in shallow water marine organisms: the case history of the European shore crabs ''Carcinus maenas'' and ''C. aestuarii'' | year=2003 |author=T.

It is believed, based on the ecological conditions, that ''C. maenas'' could eventually extend its range to colonise the Pacific coast of North America from [[Baja California]] to [[Alaska]]&nbsp;<ref name="Alaska" />. Similar ecological conditions are to be found on many of the world's coasts, with the only large potential area not to have been invaded yet being [[New Zealand]]; the New Zealand government has taken action, including the release of a Marine Pest Guide&nbsp;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.biosecurity.govt.nz/files/pests-diseases/animals/european-shore-crab/european-shore-crab-guide.pdf |title=Marine Pest Guide |publisher=[[Biosecurity New Zealand]] |date=June 2006}}</ref> in an effort to prevent colonisation by ''C. maenas''.

==Ecology==
[[Image:Crab Cangrexo 66eue.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A young ''Carcinus maenas'' showing the common green colour]]
''C. maenas'' can live in all types of protected and semi-protected [[marine (ocean)|marine]] and [[estuarine]] habitats, including habitats with mud, sand, or rock substrates, submerged aquatic vegetation, and emergent [[marsh]], although soft bottoms are preferred. ''C. maenas'' is [[euryhaline]], meaning that it can tolerate a wide range of [[salinity|salinities]] (from 4 to 52&nbsp;[[permille|‰]])and survive in [[temperature]]s from 0[[Celsius|°C]] to 30°C&nbsp;<ref>{{cite journal | quotes=no|author=A. N. Cohen & T. J.

The wide salinity range allows ''C. maenas'' to survive in the lower salinities found in [[estuary|estuaries]].

A [[molecular biology|molecular biological]] study using the [[cytochrome oxidase|COI]] [[gene]] found genetic differentiation between the North Sea and the [[Bay of Biscay]], and even more strongly between the populations in [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]] and those elsewhere.

''C. maenas'' is a [[predator]] and feeds on many organisms, particularly [[Bivalvia|bivalve molluscs]] (such as [[clam]]s, [[oyster]]s, and [[mussel]]s), [[polychaete]]s and small [[crustacean]]s&nbsp;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wdfw.wa.gov/fish/ans/greencrab.htm |author=Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife |title=European green crab}}</ref>. They are primarily nocturnal, although activity also depends on the tide, and crabs can be active at any time of day&nbsp;<ref>{{cite journal | quotes=no |author=M.

''C. maenas'' has the ability to disperse by a variety of mechanisms&nbsp;<ref name=USGS/> including: [[Sailing ballast|ballast water]], ships' hulls, packing materials ([[seaweed]]s) used to ship live marine organisms, bivalves moved for [[aquaculture]], [[raft]]ing, migration of crab [[larva]]e on [[ocean current]]s, and the movement of submerged aquatic vegetation for coastal zone management initiatives. Thresher ''et al.''&nbsp;<ref name="Thresher" /> found that in Australia ''C. maenas'' dispersed mainly by rare long-distance events, possibly caused by human actions.

In [[California]], preferential [[predation]] of ''C. maenas'' on native clams (''[[Nutricola|Nutricola spp.]]'') resulted in the decline of the native clams and an increase of a previously introduced clam (the amethyst gem clam, ''[[Amethyst gem clam|Gemma gemma]]'')&nbsp;<ref>{{cite journal | quotes=no|author=E.

''C. maenas'' has been implicated in the destruction of the soft-shell clam (''Mya arenaria'') fisheries on the east coast of the United States and Canada and the reduction of populations of other commercially important bivalves (such as [[scallops]], ''Argopecten irradians'', and northern [[quahog]]s, ''Mercenaria mercenaria'')&nbsp;<ref name=USGS/>.

''C. maenas'' can, however, have substantial negative impacts on local commercial and recreational [[fishery|fisheries]] by preying on the young of species such as [[oyster]]s and the [[Dungeness crab]], or competing with them for resources&nbsp;<ref>{{cite journal | quotes=no|author=K.

==Control==
Due to its potentially harmful effects on ecosystems, various efforts have been made to control introduced populations of ''C. maenas'' around the world. In [[Edgartown]], Massachusetts, a bounty was levied in 1995 for catching ''C. maenas'', in order to protect local [[shellfish]], and 10&nbsp;[[tons]] were caught&nbsp;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marine.csiro.au/crimp/nimpis/controlDetail.asp?ID=66 |author=F. R. McEnnulty, T. E. Jones & N. J. Bax |year=2001 |title=The Web-Based Rapid Response Toolbox. Web publication |accessyear=2006 |accessdate=March 9 |year=2002}}</ref>.

There is evidence that the native [[blue crab]] in eastern North America, ''Callinectes sapidus'', is able to control populations of ''C. maenas''; numbers of the two species are [[correlation|negatively correlated]], and ''C. maenas'' is not found in [[Chesapeake Bay]], where ''Callinectes sapidus'' is most frequent&nbsp;<ref>{{cite journal | quotes=no | author=DeRivera, C E, G M Ruiz, A H Hines & P Jivoff |year=2005 |title=Biotic resistance to invasion: Native predator limits abundance and distribution of an introduced crab |journal=[[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]] |volume=86 |issue=12 |pages=3367–3376 |url=http://serc.si.edu/labs/marine_invasions/publications/PDF/DeRivera_et_al_%202005%20_Biotic_%20resistance_to_Green_Crab.pdf}}</ref>. On the west coast of North America, ''C. maenas'' appears to be limited to upper estuarine habitats in part by predation by native rock crabs (''Cancer antennarius'' and ''Cancer productus'') and competition for shelter with a native shore crab, ''Hemigrapsus oregonensis''&nbsp;<ref>{{cite book |author=S. B. Yamada |year=2001 |title=Global invader: the European Green Crab |year = 2001|publisher = Oregon Sea Grant}}</ref>. Host specificity testing has recently been conducted on ''[[Sacculina|Sacculina carcini]]'', a [[parasite|parasitic]] [[barnacle]], as a potential biological control agent of  ''C. maenas''&nbsp;<ref name="Goddard">{{cite journal | quotes=no |author=J. H. R. Goddard, M. E. Torchin, A. M. Kuris & K. D. Lafferty |year=2005 |title=Host specificity of ''Sacculina carcini'', a potential biological control agent of introduced European green crab ''Carcinus maenas'' in California |journal=[[Biological Invasions]] |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=895–912|url=http://www.werc.usgs.gov/chis/Goddardetal05.pdf}}</ref>. In the laboratory, ''Sacculina'' settled on, infected, and killed native California crabs, including the [[Dungeness crab]], ''Cancer magister'', and the shore crabs ''Hemigrapsus nudus'', ''Hemigrapsus oregonensis'' and ''Pachygrapsus crassipes''. Dungeness crabs were the most vulnerable of the tested native species to settlement and infection by the parasite. Although ''Sacculina'' did not mature in any of the native crabs, developing reproductive sacs were observed inside a few ''Cancer magister'' and ''Hemigrapsus oregonensis''. Any potential benefits of using ''Sacculina'' to control ''C. maenas'' on the west coast of North America would need to be weighed against these potential non-target impacts&nbsp;<ref name="Goddard"/>.

''C. maenas'' has also caused significant problems in the [[Republic of Ireland]] where predation of bottom-cultured [[mussel]]s has been recorded in several counties ([[County Kerry|Kerry]], [[County Wexford|Wexford]], [[County Waterford|Waterford]]), and a number of control programmes have been instigated by mussel producers. "Hard-eye" shrimp creels are typically used to fish ''C. maenas'' in Ireland; the creels are baited, deployed and fished in 24-hour cycles, being typically deployed in strings along the boundaries of mussel beds in order to lure the crabs out of the mussel beds. Some producers pay levies for the removal of crabs, but in most cases, ''C. maenas'' catches are sold for processing into food products. This is, however, a small market and the relatively low value of ''C. maenas'' ([[Euro|€]]500 per [[tonne]]) and high transport costs (refrigerated lorry €170 per tonne) means that fishing ''C. maenas'' is uneconomical unless it forms part of a control programme to protect more valuable shellfish beds&nbsp;{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.

==Fishery==
''C. maenas'' is [[fishery|fished]] on a small scale in the north-east [[Atlantic Ocean]], with approximately 1200&nbsp;[[tonne]]s being caught annually, mostly in [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. In the north-west Atlantic, ''C. maenas'' was the subject of fishery in the 1960s, and again since 1996, with up to 86&nbsp;tonnes being caught annually&nbsp;<ref>{{cite web|title=FAO Nominal Catches: ''Carcinus maenas''|url=http://www.fishbase.org/report/FAO/FAOCatchList.cfm?&scientific=Carcinus%20maenas}}</ref>.
