During this time, the elderly man sleeping beneath the tree awoke and began screaming loudly in Pashto, causing a number of local children to run over and interpret for the Americans, explaining that the man was "just angry".

Several women immediately fled the huts and ran away while the occupants began throwing grenades at the American troops, with intermittent rifle fire. After the firefight, a statement by one of the soldiers would contradict this and say that there had only been one woman and one child present, and both were detained by US forces after exiting the huts.<ref name="OC1"/>

Morris and Silver had now taken up positions outside the stone wall, with Silver "over Morris's left shoulder explaining where he should try to position his next shot",<ref name="thestar"/> when Morris fell back into Silver, with a cut above his right eye and shrapnel embedded in his nose.

Unaware that Khadr and a militant had survived the bombing, the ground forces sent a team consisting of ''OC-1'', Silver, Speer and three Delta Force soldiers<ref>It is not immediately clear if ''OC-1'' was one of the Delta Force soldiers</ref> through a hole in the south side of the wall, while at least two other American troops continued throwing grenades into the compound.<ref name="aol">[[CBC.ca|CBC]], "[http://news.aol.ca/article/Did-Friendly-Fire-Kill-Medic-Not-Khadr/193444/ Did Friendly Fire Kill Medic, Not Khadr?]", April 12, 2008</ref>
[[Image:Speer at Bagram being unloaded by the 396th Medical.jpg|thumb|left|Speer being unloaded at Bagram.]]
The team began picking their way over the bodies of dead animals and three fighters.<ref name="thestar"/>  According to Silver's 2007 telling of the story, he then heard a sound "like a gunshot", and saw the three Delta Force soldiers duck - as a grenade flew past them and exploded near Speer, who was at the rear of the group and not wearing his helmet.<ref name="thestar"/><ref name="pay">Humphreys, Adrian.

''OC-1'' reported that although he didn't hear any gunfire, but the dust being blown from an alley on the northside of the complex led him to believe the team was under fire from a shooter between the house and barn. He reported that a grenade was also "lobbed" over the wall that led to the alley and landed 30-50&nbsp;metres from the alley opening. Running towards the alley to escape the grenade which he also didn't hear detonate, ''OC-1'' fired a dozen [[M4 Carbine]] rounds into the alley as he ran past, although he couldn't see anything due to the rising dust clouds.  Crouching at the southeast entrance to the alleyway, ''OC-1'' could see a man with a holstered pistol moving on the ground next to an [[AK-47]], with two chest wounds. From his position, ''OC-1'' fired a single shot into the man's head, killing him.<ref name="OC1"/>
[[Image:Uncropped Medical Treatment of Omar Khadr.JPG|thumb|Khadr being treated by medics.]][[Image:Omar Khadr getting battlefield first aid.jpg|thumb|Two soldiers kneel over the wounded Khadr.]]
When the dust cleared, ''OC-1'' saw Khadr crouched on his knees facing away from the action and wounded by shrapnel that had just permanently blinded his left eye,<ref name="worth"/> and shot him twice in the back.<ref name="OC1"/>

''OC-1'' estimated that all the events since entering the wall had taken less than a minute up until this point, and that he had been the only American to fire his weapon, although an American grenade had also been thrown into the living quarters after initially entering the complex.<ref name="OC1"/>

Silver initially claimed that ''two'' Delta Force troops had opened fire, shooting all three of the shots into Khadr's chest, after the youth was seen to be holding a pistol and facing the troops.<ref name="thestar"/><ref name="worth"/> These claims all directly contradict ''OC-1'''s version of events as the only eyewitness. ''OC-1'' did agree however, that something was lying in the dust near Khadr's end of the alley, although he couldn't remember if it were a pistol or grenade.<ref name="OC1"/>

Entering the alleyway, ''OC-1'' saw two dead men with a damaged AK-47 buried in rubble who he believed had been killed in the airstrikes<ref name="OC1"/>, and confirmed that the man he had shot was dead. Moving back to Khadr, ''OC-1'' tapped the motionless youth's eye, confirming that he was still alive. Turning him over onto his back, for entering troops to secure, he began exiting the alleyway to find Speer, who he was unaware had been wounded. While leaving the alleyway, he saw a third AK-47 and several grenades.<ref name="OC1"/> 
Contradicting Morris' report of five well-dressed men, ''OC-1'' maintained that a search of the rubble determined that there had only been four occupants, all found in the same alleyway.<ref name="OC1"/>

Khadr was given on-site medical attention, during which time he repeatedly asked the medics to kill him, surprising them with his English. An officer present later recorded in his diary that he was about to tell his [[Private_%28rank%29#United_States|Private Second Class]] to kill the wounded Khadr, when Delta Force soldiers ordered them not to harm the prisoner.<ref>[[Toronto Star]], [http://www.thestar.com/News/World/article/347974 Captured Khadr nearly executed: documents], March 19, 2008</ref>

The presence of Gould, who brought Khadr a [[Big Mac]] value meal,<ref name="letter"/> allowed the government to claim that the purpose of the visit was to "to ascertain Khadr's well-being", while his attorney [[Nate Whitling]] argued that "(Foreign Affairs) is suggesting that the visit was actually for (Khadr's) benefit, but this is not the case".

The Tribunals were not themselves authorized to determine whether the captives were ''lawful combatants'' -- simply to determine whether or not the captives have already been correctly proven to match the administration's definition of an "[[enemy combatant]]". Participation by the captives was voluntary, and Khadr chose not to be involved in his tribunal.

On August 31, 2004, a [[Summary of Evidence (CSRT)|Summary of Evidence memo]] was prepared for Khadr's [[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]]. The summary alleged that he had admitted he threw a [[hand grenade|grenade]] which killed a U.S. soldier, attended an [[Afghan training camp|al Qaida training camp]] in [[Kabul]] and worked as a translator for [[al Qaida]] to coordinate [[land mine]] missions. In addition, he was accused of helping to plant the landmines between Khost and [[Ghardez]], and having visited an airport near Khost to collect information on U.S. convoy movements.<ref name=CsrtSummaryOfEvidenceOmarAhmedKhadr>

During a hearing on 22 October 2008 it was revealed that, during the process of "[[discovery]]", the Prosecution had given the Defense team an incomplete version of Khadr's medical records in June of 2008.<ref name=GlobeAndMail2008-10-22>

The Prosecution had told the Defense it was complete, but, in fact, it was missing psychiatric records.
The Defense had requested Khadr's medical records in November 2007.  And Presiding Officer had ordered the Prosecution to comply.  According to the ''Globe and Mail'' Parrish ruled that the Prosecution's lapse was not necessarily due to malice.
He noted, however, that ''“those decisions have consequences,”'' and granted the Defense's request for a further delay.

===Canadian documentation===
[[Image:Omar Khadr interrogation.png|thumb|The video of Khadr's interrogation obscured the faces of interrogators.]]Khadr's defence attorneys claimed that the Canadian government acted illegally, sending its counsel and CSIS agents to Guantanamo Bay to interrogate Khadr and turning their findings over to the Tribunal prosecutors to help convict Khadr,<ref>[[Michelle Shephard|Shephard, Michelle]], [[Toronto Star]], "[http://www.thestar.com/News/Canada/article/357020 Judges question Khadr secrecy]", March 27, 2008</ref> and that the release of the documents might help prove Khadr's innocence.<ref name="Gorham"/>

In 2007, the [[Federal Court of Appeal (Canada)|Federal Court of Appeal]] ordered the Canadian government to turn over its records related to Khadr's time in captivity, as judge [[Richard Mosley]] stated it was now apparent that Canada had violated [[international law]].<ref name="globe20080709"/> The government appealed to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in 2008, arguing that Khadr was just "[[fishing expedition|fishing]]" for information and that disclosing their records, which include an initial account of the firefight which differs from all previously seen reports,<ref>[[Michelle Shephard|Shephard, Michelle]], [[Toronto Star]], "[http://www.thestar.com/News/World/article/413647 'Missing' Khadr document is in Canada], April 11, 2008</ref> could jeopardise national security.<ref name="scc">[[CTV Television Network|CTV]], [http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080326/khadr_SCC_080326/20080326?hub=CanadaAM SCC reserves decision on Omar Khadr case], March 26, 2008</ref> 

Critics alleged that the refusal to release the classified documents was due only to the "embarrassment" they caused the government,<ref name="scc"/><ref>[[CTV]], [http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080320/KHADR_COURT_080320 Supreme Court to consider Khadr's treatment claim], March 20, 2008</ref> and on May 23 2008, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruled unanimously that the government had acted illegally, contravening [[Section Seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|§. 7 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], and ordered the videotapes of the interrogation released.<ref>[[Canadian Press]], [http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5gxvjz67MqoE3WW4ITkQT8_uW_7zw Terror suspect Khadr wins partial access to federal papers for tribunal defence], May 23 2008</ref>.

===Civil lawsuit ===
[[Image:Judge Paul Cassels transparent.png|thumb|Judge Paul Cassell]]
Sgt. [[Layne Morris]] and Sgt. Speer's widow Tabitha, both represented by Donald Winder,<ref>[[CTV]], "[http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20040806/Khadr_Lawsuit_040806?s_name=&no_ads= U.S. woman sues dead Khadr dad for $10 million]", August 6, 2004</ref> filed a  [[civil suit]] against the estate of [[Ahmed Said Khadr]] - claiming that the father's failure to control his son resulted in the loss of Speers' life and Morris' right eye. Since American law doesn't allow civil lawsuits against "acts of war", Speer and Morris relied on the argument that throwing the grenade was an act of terrorism, rather than war. In February 2006, Utah District Court Judge [[Paul Cassell]] awarded the plaintiffs $102.6&nbsp;million in damages, approximately $94&nbsp;million to Speer and $8&nbsp;million to Morris,<ref>{{Ar icon}}al-Vefagh News, "[http://www.al-vefagh.com/1384/841204/html/doliat.htm بريطانيا تلقي القبض على ممثلين من القاعدة]", February 23, 2006</ref> in what he said likely marks the first time terrorist acts have resulted in civil liabilities.<ref name=SLTribune> [http://www.sltrib.com/utah/ci_3522572 GI injured in Afghan war wins lawsuit: Unique case: Court awards default judgment to man blinded in one eye], ''[[Salt Lake Tribune]]'', February 16, 2006</ref> It has been suggested that the plaintiffs might collect funds via the [[U.S. Terrorism Risk Insurance Act]],<ref name=SaltLakeTribune20070514>

==Reintegration programs==
[[Image:Sumya8.png|thumb||125px|A child at a 2008 demonstration demanding Khadr's repatriation]]In the spring of 2008, a series of visits by Canadian [[Foreign Affairs]] officials led Karim Amégan and Suneeta Millington to report that Khadr was "salvageable" if allowed to return to society, but that keeping him in the prison would risk radicalizing him.<ref name="spec">[[Hamilton Spectator]], [http://www.thespec.com/News/BreakingNews/article/379611 Khadr described as a good kid], June 3, 2008</ref> 

In June, Canada formally discussed the possibility of repatriating Khadr. It was suggested that Toronto [[Imam]] [[Hamid Slimi]] could draft a "religious rehabilitation" program, to prepare for Khadr's return.<ref name=TorontoStat20080621>
