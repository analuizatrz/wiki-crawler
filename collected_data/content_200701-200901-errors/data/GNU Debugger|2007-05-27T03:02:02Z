The '''GNU Debugger''', usually called just '''GDB''', is the standard [[debugger]] for the [[GNU]] software system. It is a portable debugger that runs on many [[Unix-like]] systems and works for many [[programming language]]s, including [[Ada programming language|Ada]], [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[FreeBASIC]], and [[Fortran programming language|FORTRAN]].

==History==
GDB was first written by [[Richard Stallman]] in [[1986]] as part of his [[GNU]] system, after his [[GNU Emacs]] was "reasonably stable".<ref>http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/stallman-kth.html</ref> GDB is [[free software]] released under the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL). It was modeled after the [[Dbx debugger]], which came with [[BSD| Berkeley Unix]] distributions.

From 1990 to 1993 it was maintained by [[John Gilmore (activist)|John Gilmore]] while he worked for [[Cygnus Solutions]].

==Technical details==
===Features===
GDB offers extensive facilities for tracing and altering the execution of [[computer program]]s. The user can monitor and modify the values of programs' internal [[variable]]s, and even call [[function (programming)|functions]] independently of the program's normal behavior.

GDB target processors (as of [[2003]]) include:
[[DEC Alpha|Alpha]], [[ARM architecture|ARM]], [[Atmel AVR|AVR]], [[Hitachi H8|H8/300]], [[System/370]], [[System 390]], [[X86]] and [[X86-64]], [[Itanium|IA-64]] "Itanium", [[Motorola 68000]], [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]], [[PA-RISC]], [[PowerPC]], [[SuperH]], [[SPARC]], and [[VAX]].

Lesser-known target processors supported in the standard release have included [[A29K]], [[Advanced RISC Computing|ARC]], [[CRIS]], [[D10V]], [[D30V]], [[FR-30]], [[FR-V]], [[Intel i960]], [[M32R]], [[Motorola 68HC11|68HC11]], [[Motorola 88000]], [[MCORE]], [[MN10200]], [[MN10300]], [[320xx microprocessor|NS32K]], [[Stormy16]], [[V850]], and [[Zilog Z8000|Z8000]].  (Newer releases will likely not support some of these.)

GDB has compiled-in [[Instruction Set Simulator|simulators]] for target processors even for lesser-known target processors such like M32R or V850.

GDB is still actively developed.  As of early 2007, the focus is on adding "reversible debugging" support<ref>http://sourceware.org/gdb/news/reversible.html</ref> &mdash; allowing a debugging session to step backwards, much like rewinding a crashed program to see what happened.

===Remote debugging===
GDB offers a 'remote' mode often used when debugging embedded systems. Remote operation is when GDB runs on one machine and the program being debugged runs on another. GDB can communicate to the remote 'stub' which understands GDB protocol via Serial or TCP/IP.

The same mode is also used by KGDB for debugging a running [[Linux kernel]] on the source level with gdb. With kgdb, kernel developers can debug a kernel in much the same way as they debug application programs. It makes it possible to place breakpoints in kernel code, step through the code and observe variables. On architectures where hardware debugging registers are available, watchpoints can be set which trigger breakpoints when specified memory addresses are executed or accessed. kgdb requires an additional machine which is connected to the machine to be debugged using a [[serial cable]] or [[ethernet]]. On [[FreeBSD]], it is also possible to debug using [[Firewire]] [[Direct memory access|DMA]].

===Limitations===
The debugger does not contain its own [[graphical user interface]], and defaults to a [[command-line interface]]. Several front-ends have been built for it, such as [[Data Display Debugger|DDD]], [http://download.eclipse.org/tools/cdt/docs/tutorials/debug_tutorial/cdt_w_debug.htm Eclipse CDT], [[GDBtk]]/[http://sources.redhat.com/insight/ Insight] and the "GUD mode" in [[GNU Emacs]]. These offer facilities similar to debuggers found in [[integrated development environment]]s.

Some other debugging tools have been designed to work with GDB, such as [[memory leak]] detectors.

==Examples of commands==
 gdb prog.out      debug prog.out
 gdb > run         run

The program is being run.  After the cause of the segmentation fault is found, the program is edited to use the correct behavior.  The corrected program is recompiled with [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] and then run.
