'''Historically black colleges and universities''' ('''HBCUs''') are institutions of [[higher education in the United States]] that were established before [[1964]] with the intention of serving the [[African American]] community. They are often [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts colleges]] or [[universities]].

==Overview==
There are [[List of historically black colleges of the United States|114 historically black colleges]] in the [[United States]] today, including public and private, two-year and four-year institutions.  Most are located in the [[Southeastern United States]]. Four are located in the [[Midwestern United States|midwestern]] states (two each in [[Missouri]] and [[Ohio]]), two are located in [[Pennsylvania]], one is in [[Delaware]], and one is in the [[United States Virgin Islands|Virgin Islands]].<ref>{{cite news|title=List of HBCUs—White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities|url= http://www.ed.gov/about/inits/list/whhbcu/edlite-list.html|publisher=U.S. Department of Education|date=2006-07-31| accessdate=2007-03-29}}</ref>

Other educational institutions may have large numbers of African Americans in their student body, but as they were founded (or opened their doors to African Americans) after the ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' ruling by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] (the court decision which outlawed [[racial segregation]] of public education facilities), by definition they are not historically black colleges. Such institutions have been termed predominantly black.
