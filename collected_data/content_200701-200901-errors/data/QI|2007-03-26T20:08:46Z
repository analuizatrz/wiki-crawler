'''''QI''''', standing for '''''Quite Interesting''''' and a play on '''''[[Intelligence quotient|IQ]]''''', is a comedy [[panel game]] television show hosted by [[Stephen Fry]] and shown on [[BBC Two]] and [[BBC Four]], with older, syndicated episodes are shown on [[UKTV G2]]. ''QI'' is one of the most successful shows shown on the BBC, having the highest ratings of any show on BBC Four.<ref>[http://www.qi.com/tv/audience.php QI.com] Audience figures.</ref>

It is distinguished by the awarding of points not necessarily for the ''correct'' answer, but rather, for an ''interesting'' one. Many of the questions and answers are extremely obscure. Points are deducted from a panellist who gives an ''obvious but wrong'' (that is to say, boring or conventional) answer, typically one that is generally accepted as true but is, in fact, false. It is therefore possible (and quite likely) that a panellist will have a negative point score at the end of the game. In the words of the QI website, regular panellist  ''"Alan Davies has turned this aspect of the game into somewhat of an art form."''

== Format and conception==
The panel consists of four panellists, one of whom, [[Alan Davies]], appears in all episodes, except for one episode in series four (although he does appear at the beginning and through voiceover for the rest of it). He is the frequent target of jokes — mainly initiated by Stephen Fry — and is the panellist who normally offers up most of the "obvious but wrong" answers. Therefore, he usually finishes last. He also holds the record for the lowest score in a single episode, of -144. This was due to him guessing that [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]]'s first name was "Randy" (the correct answer is Mohandas Karamchand) thus resulting in a 150 point penalty. Davies was leading by 3 points at the time, and would have won if he had not got the penalty.

To date, Davies has won only three times: in episode 10 of the first series and in episodes 6 and 9 of the fourth series, which is nearly a three-year gap between the first and second victories. However, his third victory was helped due to Fry accidentally giving away the answer to a special bonus question, scoring 50 points. However, it was discovered he would have won anyway with out the bonus. This third win puts him towards, if indeed not <i>at</i>, the top of the ''QI'' leaderboard in wins — though since he's been on every episode of the 40-plus so far, his win percentage is small at 6.122%<ref>3 is 6.12245% of 49. Figure correct as of December 2006.</ref>.

Most other panellists come from a [[stand-up comedy]] background, although there have also been musicians, actors, television personalities and poets including [[Richard E. Grant]], [[Jeremy Clarkson]], [[Gyles Brandreth]] and [[Roger McGough]].

Unusually, the audience are also allowed to answer questions when the panel cannot answer them. This once resulted in the audience winning one show by answering just one question, scoring two points.

[[Image:QI_Logo.png|thumb|right|200px|The QI Logo.]]

Providing an "obvious but wrong" answer results in a sequence of [[klaxon]]s. In the first and second series, Stephen Fry produced the answer on a card to show the panellists, while it also flashed on the large screens behind them (excepting the very first episode, when only the cards were used). In the third series and onward, Fry's answer cards were dispensed with altogether, leaving only the screens as proof that the answers given had been predicted.

Tangential discussions and even complete non-sequiturs abound on the show, for panellists are apt to branch off into frivolous conversations, give voice to train of thought, and share humorous anecdotes from their own lives.

Writer and former [[BBC]] producer [[John Lloyd (writer)|John Lloyd]] devised the format of the show, and it is produced by Quite Interesting Ltd., an organisation set up by Lloyd. 

The show was originally conceived as a radio show, with Lloyd as chairman. When it was decided that the show would air on television, [[Michael Palin]] was offered the job of chairman with Fry and Davies as captains of 'clever' and 'stupid' teams respectively.<ref>[http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2006/12/21/4850/last_among_eqials Last among eQIals]</ref>

The theme tune was composed by [[Howard Goodall]], who has twice appeared as a panellist on the show.

=== Buzzers ===
[[Image:QIfront.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Stephen Fry presenting an episode of ''QI''.]]
Each of the panel has a [[buzzer]], the sound of which is often based along some sort of theme. The sounds are demonstrated at the beginning of the programme, but are sometimes changed in some way the very next time they are used. Davies' buzzer usually contradicts the others' in some amusing way.  Davies' buzzer has been the last to be demonstrated in every episode except for the pilot, in which he went first and Eddie Izzard, with a sillier buzzer, went last.

=== General Ignorance ===
{{main|General Ignorance}}
[[Image:QI_Davies.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Alan Davies on ''QI''.]]
In a parody of ubiquitous [[general knowledge]] quizzes, the final round is off-topic and called "General Ignorance", focusing upon seemingly-easy questions which have "obvious but wrong" answers. Whereas in the main rounds of the show, the panellists' use of buzzers is not usually enforced, the "General Ignorance" questions are introduced by Fry's reminder to keep "fingers on buzzers".

One Christmas episode saw Davies making a stand and announcing that he didn't want to do General Ignorance because he always got the questions wrong, saying that he "will not ''be'' humiliated at Christmas". In turn, Fry offered to switch places with him, to the delight of the audience. Despite the seeming spontaneity of the swap, it was undoubtedly pre-planned (at least on the part of Davies and the producers), as evidenced by the fact that Davies, in turn, produced his own set of questions on loose-leaf paper, most of which he directed at Fry. At the end of the show, Fry announced that the game's loser was, in fact, he himself, as a result of his conceding to many of Davies' traps.

=== Extra tasks ===
In some episodes, panellists are given an extra task to complete during the course of the game. Those who do the best are often awarded extra points. One of the most famous was a special 200 point bonus question, about the chemical formula for the explosion in a custard factory. The answer was correctly answered by [[Helen Atkinson-Wood]], who managed to score a grand total of 200 points, the highest ever score in ''QI''.

==Episodes==

{{seealso|List of QI episodes}}

The first series started on [[11 September]] [[2003]]. All of the questions (with the exception of the final "General Ignorance" round) were on subjects beginning with "a" except in the Christmas Special (e.g., "[[arthropods]]", "[[Alan (name)|Alan]]s", "[[astronomy]]", etc.) A second series of 12 programmes started on [[8 October]] [[2004]]. In a continuation of the established theme, subjects began with the letter "b" (except in two episodes, one about [[music]] and one about [[colour]]). Series three started on [[30 September]] [[2005]], and all subjects began with the letter "c" (e.g. "[[custard]], [[cheating]]"). The fourth series, Series D, began filming on [[19 April]] [[2006]] and began transmission on [[29 September]] [[2006]]. ([[Danger]], [[Death]], [[Dog|Dogs]]). The fifth series, Series E, has been commissioned for [[2007]]. [http://www.qi.com/talk/viewtopic.php?t=3755&start=0]

===Most appearances===
This list contains the people who have made the most appearances.

* [[Alan Davies]] (permanent panellist, to Fry's immediate right)
* [[Rich Hall]]
* [[Jo Brand]]
* [[Phill Jupitus]]
* [[Bill Bailey]]
* [[Sean Lock]]
* [[John Sessions]]
* [[Clive Anderson]]
* [[Jimmy Carr]]

Many of the frequent participants are managed by the ''Off the Kerb Productions'' comedy group.

==Highlights==

The questions are, as in many comedy panel games, mainly created to set up jokes or discussions, rather than for any serious competition. Certain questions are purposely contradictory to established doctrine for the sake of entertainment. For example, to the question "How many planets are there in the solar system?", Alan Davies gave the answer "Nine" and lost points for an "obvious but wrong" answer, the explanation being that at the time a debate was occurring over whether [[Pluto (planet)|Pluto]] was indeed a planet (see ''[[2006 redefinition of planet]]''). However, as the [[International Astronomical Union]] still defined Pluto as a planet at the time of questioning, the answer "nine" ''would'' have been a "correct" answer, if one accepted the contemporaneous IAU definition.

A further example of this purposeful contradiction occurred during the second series, when the question "How many moons does the Earth have?" was asked. Alan Davies had, in the previous series, been given negative points for answering "One" to the same question, due to the presence of the [[asteroid]] [[3753 Cruithne|Cruithne]] which has an [[orbital resonance]] with Earth (although it is not normally defined as a [[natural satellite]]). This time, he was again given negative points for answering with "two", which was counted as correct during the first series. The change in answer was attributed to the recent discovery of new satellites ([[(54509) 2000 PH5|(54509) 2000 PH<sub>5</sub>]], [[(85770) 1998 UP1|(85770) 1998 UP<sub>1</sub>]] and [[2002 AA29|2002 AA<sub>29</sub>]]) that share a similar resonance to Cruithne with respect to the Earth. In the Series 1 episode, Rich Hall returned the question when, following this, in response to the question "What man-made artifacts can be seen from the moon with the naked eye?" he said, "Which moon are we talking about?"

Another highlight came when Rory McGrath demonstrated his extensive knowledge of the elements of the Periodic Table and Latin names for birds, but by doing this he became ''too'' interesting and began to bore the other panellists, so much so that Sean Lock pretended to be dragged under the desk while Rory and Stephen were discussing bird names ("I am so sorry, there's a portal into the underworld down there! It's ridiculous!") He continued to mock Rory after that ("Do I get more points if I say the answer in another language?") but apparently in good spirit.

A "Luvvie Alarm" has on occasion sounded when a guest does a blatant name drop. It was originally used on [[John Sessions]] when he name dropped [[Robert Redford]] in series 2, and was used on Fry (when Sessions came back as a panelist in an episode of series 3), when he mentioned a party he had attended hosted by the [[Gerald Grosvenor, 6th Duke of Westminster|Duke and Duchess of Westminster]] (as pointed out by guest [[Clive Anderson]], the Duke was [at the time of recording] the second richest man in the UK after [[Roman Abramovich]]; [[as of 2006]], he is currently third-richest after Abramovich and [[Lakshmi Mittal]]).

At the end of the third series, [[Dara Ó Briain]] was deducted points for having stated, in the series before, that the [[triple point]] of [[water]] is zero degrees [[Celsius]], an answer which earned him points at the time. Some viewers, however, wrote in to say that the triple point of water is in fact 0.0''1'' degrees, and so the points awarded Dara in the previous series were revoked. Dara humorously retorted with, "How many people sat at home watching that and said, 'It's just a comedy show, but I'm not letting that [[feck]]er get away with that!'?"

Some people have suggested that answers to questions are rehearsed in advance, in order to provide a more entertaining programme, an accusation also headed towards shows such as ''[[Have I Got News for You]]''. On the official website the makers of the show insist that this is not the case, and instead a series of "warm up" questions are asked before recording starts.

Although many of the facts presented on the show are correct, there have been the occasional slip-up, such as announcing the age of the oldest woman to be 125 when she died, when in fact she, [[Jeanne Calment]], only lived to be 122.

==''QI'' culture==
[[Image:QI-Book.jpg|thumb|right|''QI: The Book of General Ignorance'']]

In October 2004 a ''QI'' [[café]]/[[bar (establishment)|bar]], eclectic bookshop and private members' [[club]] opened at Quite Interesting Ltd's headquarters, on [[Turl Street]] in [[Oxford]]. For the duration of the series, the bar shows the broadcast episode every Friday. The club intends to promote things that are 'quite interesting', and arranges speakers and events.

On [[14 November]] [[2005]] an interactive ''QI'' game on DVD was released by [[Warner Home Video]].

After much pressure from fans, the [[BBC]]'s DVD division, [[2 entertain]] released the first TV series on DVD on [[6 November]] [[2006]]. The DVD also contains the pilot, which has never been broadcast, and features to date the only appearance of [[Eddie Izzard]] as a panellist.

On [[5 October]] [[2006]], ''[http://www.faber.co.uk/book_detail.html?bid=37386 The Book of General Ignorance]'' was published in hardback by [[Faber and Faber]], with a [[foreword]] by Stephen Fry and "Four words by Alan Davies" - "Will this do, Stephen?". It contains a list of 200 popular misconceptions, most of which have appeared in the "General Ignorance" round of ''QI''. On [[8 December]] [[2006]], the book reached the top of [[amazon.co.uk|amazon.co.uk's]] [[best-seller]] list.

A ''QI'' feature has appeared in [[BBC MindGames Magazine|''BBC MindGames'']] magazine from its fifth issue and is based on facts and questions in the sphere of General Ignorance.  From [[10 February]] [[2007]] a weekly QI column began in ''[[The Telegraph]]''; 52 columns are planned.

==The QI Elves==
The Elves devise the questions for ''QI''. The Elves spend their time researching several topics, constantly trying to find things 'quite interesting'. Often, when a subject is brought up in the show, the Elves will contact the show mid-way to provide and even correct information given. The panellists are given the list of questions to be asked an hour or two before recording, but are forbidden to ask the Elves for preparatory materials or other help.<ref>''QI Series 1 DVD'' Factoids</ref> It is known that Alan never does any preparation at all.<ref>''QI Series 1 DVD'' Factoids</ref>
