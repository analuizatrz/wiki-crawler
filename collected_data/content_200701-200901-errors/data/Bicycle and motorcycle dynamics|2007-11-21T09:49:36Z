[[Image:BikeModel.jpg|thumb|A simplified mathematical model of bike and rider demonstrating the dynamic of a right turn]]

'''Bicycle and motorcycle dynamics''' is the [[science]] of the motion of [[bicycle]]s and [[motorcycle]]s, in entirety or in parts, due to the forces acting on them during [[Mechanical equilibrium|balancing]], [[countersteering|steering]], [[brake|braking]], and [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]]. [[Experiment]]ation and [[mathematical model|mathematical analysis]] have shown that a bike stays upright when it is steered to keep its [[center of mass]] over its wheels. This steering is usually supplied by a rider, or in certain circumstances, by the bike itself. Long-standing hypotheses and claims that [[gyroscopic]] effect is the main stabilizing force have been refuted.<ref name="klein">{{cite web

While remaining upright may be the primary goal of beginning riders, a bike must lean in order to turn. The higher the [[speed]] or smaller the turn [[radius]], the more lean is required. This is necessary in order to balance [[centrifugal force]]s due to the turn with [[gravitational force]]s due to the lean. When braking, depending on the location of the combined center of mass of the bike and rider with respect to the point where the front wheel contacts the ground, bikes can either skid the front wheel or flip the bike and rider over the front wheel.

==Forces==
The forces that act on a bike and its components include [[Gravitation|gravity]], [[Reaction (physics)|ground reaction]] (usually at the front and rear wheel [[contact patch]]es with both horizontal and vertical components), [[Centrifugal force|centrifugal]] (in the accelerating [[Frame of reference|reference frame]] of the bike and rider; in a stationary, [[Inertial frame of reference|inertial reference frame]] this is simply [[inertia]] and not a force at all), [[Gyroscope#Properties|gyroscopic]] (due to rotating parts such as wheels, engine, transmission, etc.), [[Vehicle propulsion|propulsive]] (usually at the rear wheel contact patch), [[torque]]s applied between the steering mechanism (front fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) and rear frame, and between the rider and the rear frame, [[friction]] (between any parts that move against each other: at the tire contact patches, as mentioned above, in the [[Powertrain|drive train]], between the steering mechanism and the rear frame, etc.), and [[Full aerodynamic force|aerodynamic]] (mostly in the form of [[Drag (physics)|drag]], but also possibly from a [[crosswind]]).

==Balance==
A bike remains upright when it is steered so that the [[Reaction (physics)|ground reaction forces]] exactly balance all the other forces it experiences such as gravitational, inertial or centrifugal if in a turn, and aerodynamic if in a [[crosswind]].<ref name="whitt">{{cite book

Steering may be supplied by a rider or, under certain circumstances, by the bike itself. This self-stability is generated by a combination of several effects that depend on the geometry, mass distribution, and forward speed of the bike. Tires, suspension, steering damping, and frame flex can also influence it, especially in motorcycles.

If the steering of a bike is locked, it becomes virtually impossible to ride. Instead, if just the gyroscopic effect of rotating bike wheels is cancelled by adding counter-rotating wheels, it can still be easily ridden.<ref name="klein">{{cite web

===Forward speed===
Steering inputs counter lean to maintain balance. At high speeds, the input required to return the bike to upright only needs to be small; a much greater input is required to maintain balance at low speed. As such, it is easier to maintain balance at high speeds.<ref>{{cite web

| accessdate = 2006-08-23
}}</ref>

===Center of mass location===
The farther forward (closer to front wheel) the [[center of mass]] of the combined bike and rider, the less the front wheel has to move laterally in order to maintain balance. Conversely, the further back (closer to the rear wheel) the center of mass is located, the more front wheel lateral movement or bike forward motion will be required to regain balance. This can be noticeable on long-wheelbase [[Recumbent bicycle|recumbents]] and [[choppers]].

A bike is also an example of an [[inverted pendulum]]. Thus, just as a broomstick is easier to balance than a pencil, tall bikes (with a high center of mass) can be easier to balance than short ones because their lean rate will be slower.<ref>{{cite web

A top-heavy bike can require more effort to keep upright, when stopped in traffic for example, than a bike with a lower center of mass.

===Trail===
[[Image:Head angle rake and trail.svg|right|frame|Bicycle [[Caster angle|head angle]], [[Rake and trail|rake, and trail]]]]

A factor that influences how easy or hard a bike will be to ride is [[Bicycle and motorcycle geometry|trail]], the distance by which the front wheel ground contact point trails behind the point where a line through the steering axis, the axis about which the steering mechanism (fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) pivots, intersects the ground. In traditional bike designs, with a steering axis tilted back from the vertical, trail causes the front wheel to steer into the direction of a lean, independent of forward speed.<ref name="whitt" />
This can be seen by pushing a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side. In a lean, gravity provides this force.

The more trail a bike has, the more stable it feels. Bikes with negative trail (where the contact patch is actually in front of where the steering axis intersects the ground), while still ridable, feel very unstable. Bikes with too much trail feel difficult to steer.  Normally, road racing bicycles have more trail than mountain bikes or touring bikes.  In the case of mountain bikes, less trail allows more accurate path selection off-road, and also allows the rider to recover from obstacles on the trail which might knock the front wheel off-course.  Touring bikes are built with small trail to allow the rider to control a bike weighed down with luggage.  As a consequence, an unloaded touring bike can feel rather unstable to ride.  In bicycles, [[bicycle fork|fork]] rake, often a curve in the fork blades forward of the steering axis, is used to diminish trail.<ref name="zinn">{{cite news

Trail is a function of head angle, [[Bicycle fork|fork]] offset or rake, and wheel size. Their relationship can be described by this formula:<ref>{{cite web

:<math>Trail = \frac{(R_w \cos(A_h) - O_f)}{\sin(A_h)}</math>
where <math>R_w</math> wheel radius, <math>A_h</math> is the head angle measured clock-wise from the horizontal and <math>O_f</math> is the fork offset or rake. Trail can be increased by increasing the wheel size, decreasing or slackening the head angle, or decreasing the fork rake.

A small survey by Whitt and Wilson<ref name="whitt" /> found:
*[[touring bicycle]]s with head angles between 72° and 73° and trail between 43 mm and 60 mm
*[[racing bicycle]]s with head angles between 73° and 74° and trail between 28 mm and 45 mm
*[[track bicycle]]s with head angles of 75° and trail between 23.5 mm and 37 mm

both with forks that have 45 mm of offset or rake and the same size wheels:
*a 2007 Filmore, designed for the track, with a head angle that varies from 72.5° to 74° depending on frame size
*a 2006 Tete de Course, designed for road racing, with a head angle that varies from 71.25° to 74°, depending on frame size

===Steering mechanism mass distribution===
Another factor that can also contribute to the self-stability of traditional bike designs is the distribution of mass in the steering mechanism, which includes the front wheel, the fork and the handlebar. If the center of mass for the steering mechanism is forward of the steering axis, then the pull of gravity will also cause the front wheel to steer in the direction of a lean. This can be seen by leaning a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side independent of any interaction with the ground.<ref name="hand">{{cite web

More subtle effects, such as the fore-to-aft position of the center of mass and the elevation of the center of mass also contribute to the dynamic behavior of a bike.<ref name="hand" /><ref name="whitt" />

===Gyroscopic effects===
The role of the gyroscopic effect in most bike designs is to help steer the front wheel into the direction of a lean. This phenomenon is called [[precession]] and the rate at which an object precesses is inversely proportional to its rate of spin. The slower a front wheel spins, the faster it will precess when the bike leans, and vice-versa.<ref name="fajans">{{cite journal

The rear wheel is prevented from precessing as the front wheel does by friction of the tires on the ground, and so continues to lean as though it were not spinning at all. Hence gyroscopic forces do not provide any resistance to tipping.

At low forward speeds, the precession of the front wheel is too quick, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to oversteer, start to lean the other way and eventually oscillate and fall over. At high forward speeds, the precession is usually too slow, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to understeer and eventually fall over without ever having reached the upright position.<ref name="Wilson">{{cite book

This instability is very slow, on the order of seconds, and is trivial to counteract for most riders. Thus a fast bike may feel stable even though it is actually not self-stable and would fall over if it were uncontrolled.

===Self stability===
Between these two extremes, there may be a range of forward speeds for a given bike design at which the effects described above steer an uncontrolled bike upright.<ref name="smp">{{cite journal

However, even without self-stability a bike may be ridden by steering it to keep it over its wheels.<ref name="jones" />

See a [http://www.tam.cornell.edu/~ad29/JBike6/JBike6_self_stable_files/bicycle_stability.mpeg video] of a riderless bicycle exhibiting this self-stability.

Note that the effects mentioned above that combine to produce self stability may be overwhelmed by additional factors such as [[headset (bicycle part)|headset]] friction and stiff [[Bowden cable|control cables]].<ref name="whitt" />

==Instability==
Bikes, as complex mechanisms, have a variety of unstable modes: ways that they can be unstable. Some of the names given to these instabilities include capsize, weave, and wobble. These different modes are differentiated by the speed at which they occur and the relative phases of leaning and steering.

In this context, "stability" is used to mean that an uncontrolled bike will continue rolling forward without eventually falling over. Conversely "instability" means that an uncontrolled bike will eventually fall over.

===Modes===
There are three main unstable [[Normal mode|modes]] that a bike can experience: capsize, weave, and wobble. A lesser known mode is rear wobble, and it is usually stable.

====Capsize====
'''Capsize''' is the word used to describe a bike falling over, without oscillation. An uncontrolled front wheel usually steers in the direction of lean during capsize until a very high lean angle is reached, at which point the steering may turn in the opposite direction. A capsize can happen very slowly if the bike is moving forward rapidly. Because the capsize instability is so slow, on the order of seconds, it is easy for the rider to control, and is actually used by the rider to initiate the lean necessary for a turn.<ref name="Cossalter">{{cite book

| id = ISBN 978-1-4303-0861-4
| pages = 241-342}}</ref>

====Weave====
'''Weave''' is the word used to describe a slow (0-4 Hz) oscillation between leaning left and steering right and vice-versa. The entire bike is affected with significant changes in steering angle, lean angle (roll), and heading angle (yaw). The steering is 180° out of phase with the heading and 90° out of phase with the leaning.<ref name="Cossalter" />

For most bikes, depending on geometry and mass distribution, weave is unstable at low speeds, and becomes less pronounced as speed increases until it is no longer unstable. While the amplitude may decrease, the frequency actually increases with speed.

Here is a video that shows weave: [http://www2.ee.ic.ac.uk/cap/cappp/projects/2/files/weave_0_65.avi AVI movie]

====Wobble or shimmy====
'''Wobble''', '''shimmy''', '''tank-slapper''', [[speed wobble]], and even '''death wobble''' are all words and phrases used to describe a quick (4 - 10 Hz) oscillation of primarily just the front end (front wheel, fork, and handlebars). The rest of the bike remains mostly unaffected. This instability occurs mostly at high speed and is similar to that experienced by shopping cart wheels, airplane landing gear, and automobile front wheels.<ref name="Wilson" /><ref name="Cossalter" />

While wobble or shimmy can be easily remedied by adjusting speed, position, or grip on the handlebar, they can be fatal if left uncontrolled.<ref>{{cite news

}}</ref>

Wobble or shimmy begins when some otherwise minor irregularity accelerates the wheel to one side. The restoring force is applied in phase with the progress of the irregularity, and the wheel turns to the other side where the process is repeated. If there is insufficient [[steering damper|damping]] in the steering the oscillation will increase until system failure. Speed changes, making the bike stiffer or lighter, or increasing the stiffness of the steering (of which the rider is the main component) can change the oscillation frequency, though only speed change is applicable in the situation.<ref name="whitt" />

Here is a video that shows wobble: [http://www2.ee.ic.ac.uk/cap/cappp/projects/2/files/wobble_0_65.avi AVI movie]

====Rear wobble====
The term '''rear wobble''' is used to describe a mode of oscillation in which lean angle (roll) and heading angle (yaw) are almost in phase and both 180° out of phase with steer angle. The rate of this oscillation is moderate with a maximum of about 6.5 Hz. Rear wobble is heavily damped and falls off quickly as bike speed increases.<ref name="Cossalter" />

===Design criteria===
The design characteristics of a bike can affect these instabilities in the following ways:<ref>{{cite web

| format = PDF
| accessdate = 2006-08-04
}}</ref>
====Frame stiffness====
Lateral and torsional stiffness of the [[Motorcycle#Chassis|rear frame]] and the wheel spindle affect the wobble-mode damping substantially with significant changes in the wobble frequency and slight reduction in the weave-mode damping at high speeds.

====Geometry====
Long [[Trail (bicycles)#Wheelbase|wheelbase]] and [[Trail (bicycles)#Trail|trail]] and a flat [[Trail (bicycles)#Steering axis angle|steering-head angle]] have been found to increase weave-mode damping. Lateral distortion can be countered by locating the [[Motorcycle fork|front fork]] torsional axis as low as possible.
====Suspension====
Degraded damping of the [[Suspension (motorcycle)#Rear suspension|rear suspension]] amplify cornering weave tendencies.
====Tire characteristics====
Cornering and camber stiffnesses and relaxation length of the rear [[tire]], make the largest contribution to weave damping, but not so much from the same parameters of the front tire. Inflation pressures are also important variables in the behavior of a motorcycle at high speeds.
====Loading====
Rear loading amplifies cornering weave tendencies. Rear load assemblies with appropriate stiffness and damping were successful in damping out weave and wobble oscillations.

==Turning==
[[Image:BikeLeanForces2.svg|frame|right|The forces acting on a leaning bike in the rotating reference frame of a turn where <math>N</math> is the normal force, <math>F</math> is friction, and <math>m</math> is mass]]

In order to '''turn''', that is change their direction of forward travel, bikes must lean to balance the relevant forces: gravitational, inertial, frictional, and ground support. The angle of lean, <math>\theta</math>, can easily be calculated using the laws of [[circular motion]]:
:<math>\theta = \arctan \left (\frac{gr}{v^2} \right )</math>
where <math>v</math> is the forward speed, <math>r</math> is the radius of the turn and <math>g</math> is the acceleration of [[gravity]].<ref name="fajans" />

For example, a bike in a 10&nbsp;m (33&nbsp;ft) radius steady-state turn at 10&nbsp;m/s (22&nbsp;mph) must be at an angle of ca. 45°. A rider can lean with respect to the bike in order to keep either the torso or the bike more or less upright if desired. The angle that matters is the one between the horizontal plane and the plane between the tire contacts and the location of the center of mass of bike and rider.

===Countersteering===
{{main|Countersteering}}
In order to initiate a turn, a bike must momentarily steer in the opposite direction. This is often referred to as countersteering. This brief turn moves the wheels out from directly underneath the center of mass, and thus causes a lean in the desired direction. Where there is no external influence such as an opportune side wind to create the force necessary to lean the bike, countersteering happens in every turn.<ref name="fajans" />

As the lean approaches the desired angle, the front wheel must be steered in the direction of the turn, depending on the forward speed, the turn radius, and the need to maintain the lean angle. Once in a turn, the radius can only be changed with an appropriate change in lean angle, and this can only be accomplished by additional countersteering out of the turn to increase lean and decrease radius, then into the turn to decrease lean and increase radius. To exit the turn, the bike must again countersteer and momentarily steer more into the turn to decrease the radius to increase inertial forces in order decrease the angle of lean.<ref>{{cite web

| accessdate = 2006-08-08
}}</ref>

===No hands===
While countersteering is usually initiated by applying torque directly to the handlebars, on lighter vehicles such as bicycles, it can also be accomplished by shifting the rider’s weight. If the rider leans to the right relative to the bike, the bike will lean to the left to conserve [[angular momentum]], and the combined center of mass will remain in the same vertical plane. This leftward lean of the bike will cause it to steer to the left and initiate a right hand turn as if the rider had countersteered to the left by applying a torque directly to the handle bars.<ref name="fajans" />

Note that this technique may be complicated by additional factors such as [[headset (bicycle part)|headset]] friction and stiff [[Bowden cable|control cables]].

===Two-wheel steering===
Because of theoretical benefits, such as a tighter turning radius at low speed, attempts have been made to construct motorcycles with '''two-wheel steering'''. One working prototype by Ian Drysdale in Australia is reported "by all accounts it seems to work very well."<ref>{{cite web

Issues in the design include whether to provide active control on the rear wheel or let it swing freely. In the case of active control, the control algorithm needs to decide between steering with or opposite of the front wheel, when, and how much.

The [[Sideways bike]] is another implementation of two-wheel steering which lets the rider control the steering of both wheels directly.

===Rear-wheel steering===
Because of the theoretical benefits, especially a simplified [[front-wheel drive]] mechanism, attempts have been made to construct a ridable '''rear-wheel steering''' bike. For example, the Bendix Company built a rear-wheel steering bicycle, and the U.S. Department of Transportation commissioned construction of a rear-wheel steering motorcycle: both proved to be unridable. One documented case of someone successfully riding a rear-wheel steering bicycle is of L. H. Laiterman at MIT on a specially designed recumbent.<ref name="whitt" />

Rainbow Trainers, Inc. in Alton, IL, offers "A cash prize of US$5,000 ... to the first living person, hereafter referred to as the challenger, who can successfully ride the rear-steered bicycle, Rear Steered Bicycle I."<ref>{{cite web

The difficulty is due to the fact that turning left, accomplished by turning the rear wheel to the right, initially moves the center of mass to the right, and vice versa. This makes compensating for leans induced by the environment tricky.<ref>{{cite web

Examination of the [[Bicycle and motorcycle dynamics#Eigenvalues|eigenvalues]] shows that the configuration is inherently unstable.

===Center steering===

Between classical front-wheel steering, and strictly rear-wheel steering, is a class of bikes with a pivot point somewhere between these two extremes and referred to as '''center-steering'''. These design allow for simple [[front-wheel drive]] and appear to be quite stable, even ridable no-hands, as many photographs attest.<ref>{{cite web

These designs usually have very lax head angles (40° to 65°) and positive or even negative trail. The builder of a bike with negative trail states that steering the bike from straight ahead forces the seat (and thus the rider) to rise slightly and this offsets the destabilizing effect of the negative trail.<ref>{{cite web

=== Tiller effect ===

'''Tiller effect''' is the expression used to describe how handlebars that extend far behind the steering axis (head tube) act like a [[tiller]] on a boat in that one moves the bars to the right in order to turn the front wheel to the left, and vice versa. This situation is commonly found on [[Cruiser bicycle|cruisers]], some [[Recumbent bicycle|recumbents]], and even some [[Motorcycle#Types|cruiser motorcycles]]. It can be problematic when it limits the ability to steer because of interference or the limits of arm reach.<ref>{{cite web

==Braking==<!-- This section is linked from [[Bicycle brake systems]] -->
Most of the braking force of standard upright bikes comes from the front wheel. If the [[Bicycle brake systems|brakes]] themselves are strong enough, the rear wheel is easy to skid, while the front wheel often can generate enough stopping force to flip the rider and bike over the front wheel. This is called a [[stoppie]] if the rear wheel is lifted but the bicycle does not flip or an ‘endo’ (abbreviated form of 'end-over-end') if the bicycle flips. However, long or low bikes, such as [[Types of motorcycle#cruiser|cruiser motorcycles]] and [[recumbent bicycle]]s, can also skid the front tire, causing a loss of the ability to balance.

===Longitudinal stability===
Mechanical analysis of the forces generated by a bike with a [[Bicycle and motorcycle geometry#wheelbase|wheelbase]] <math>L</math> and a center of mass at height <math>h</math> and halfway between the wheels, with both wheels locked, reveals that the normal (vertical) forces at the wheels are:<ref>{{cite book

:<math>N_f = mg\left(\frac{1}{2} + \mu \frac{h}{L}\right)</math>
for the front wheel, while the frictional (horizontal) forces are simply <math>F_r = \mu N_r</math> for the rear wheel and <math>F_f = \mu N_f</math> for the front wheel, where <math>\mu</math> is the [[coefficient of friction]], <math>m</math> is the [[mass]] and <math>g</math> is the acceleration of [[gravity]]. Thus if
:<math>\mu \frac{h}{L} \ge \frac{1}{2}</math>
then the normal force of the rear wheel will be zero (at which point the equation no longer applies) and the bike will begin to flip forward over the front wheel.

The [[coefficient of friction]] of [[rubber]] on dry [[asphalt]] is between 0.5 and 0.8.<ref name="kurtus">{{cite web

Using the lower value of 0.5, and if the center of mass height is greater than or equal to the wheel base, the front wheel can generate sufficient stopping force to flip the bike and rider forward over the front wheel.

On the other hand, if the center of mass height is less than half the wheelbase and at least halfway towards the rear wheel, for example a [[Tandem bicycle|tandem]] or a long-wheel-base [[Recumbent bicycle|recumbent]], then even if the coefficient of friction is 1.0, it is impossible for the front wheel to generate enough braking force to flip the bike. It will skid unless it hits some fixed obstacle such as a curb.

A riding technique that takes advantage of how braking increases the downward force on the front wheel is known as [[trail braking]].

In the case of a front [[Suspension (motorcycle)|suspension]], especially telescoping [[fork tube]]s, this increase in downward force on the front end may cause the suspension to compress and the front end to lower. This is known as [[Suspension (motorcycle)#Brake Dive|brake diving]].

===Front wheel braking===

The limiting factors on the maximum deceleration in front wheel braking are:
*the maximum, limiting value of [[Friction#Static_friction|static friction]] between the tire and the ground,
*the [[Friction#Kinetic_friction|kinetic friction]] between the brake pads and the rim or disk,
*pitching over the front wheel.

For an upright bicycle on dry asphalt with excellent brakes, pitching will probably be the limiting fact. The combined center of mass of a typical upright bicycle and rider will be about 60&nbsp;cm back from the front wheel contact patch and 120&nbsp;cm above, allowing a maximum deceleration of 0.5&nbsp;g (4.9&nbsp;m/s² or 16&nbsp;ft/s²).<ref name="whitt"/>
However, if the rider modulates the brakes properly, pitching can be avoided. If the rider moves his weight back and down even larger decelerations are possible.

Front brakes on many inexpensive bikes are not strong enough so, on the road, they are the limiting factor. Cheap cantilever brakes, especially with "power modulators", severely restrict the stopping force. So do Raleigh-style side-pull brakes. In wet conditions they are even less effective.

Front wheel slides are more common off-road. Mud, water and loose stones reduce the friction between the tire and road. Knobby tires can mitigate this effect by grabbing the surface irregularities.

Front wheel slides are also common on corners, whether on road or off. This is because the centripetal acceleration adds to the forces on the tire/ground contact. When the friction force is exceeded the wheel slides.

===Rear wheel braking===

The rear brake of a upright bicycle can only produce about 0.1&nbsp;g deceleration at best.<ref name="whitt"/>
This is due to the decrease in normal force at the rear wheel as described above.

On motorcycles, light rear-wheel braking, sometimes referred to as dragging, can be a useful aid to stability when turning at low speed.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}

==Theory==
Although its equations of motion can be linearized, a bike is a [[Nonlinearity|nonlinear]] system: its behavior is not expressible as a sum of the behaviors of its descriptors.<ref name="Meijaard">{{cite web

In the idealized case, in which friction and any flexing is ignored, a bike is a [[Conservation of energy#Mechanics|conservative]] system. However, and perhaps surprisingly, it can still demonstrate damping: side-to-side oscillations will decrease with time. Energy added with a sideways jolt to a bike running straight and upright (demonstrating [[Bicycle and motorcycle dynamics#self stability|self stability]]) is converted into increased forward speed, not lost, as the oscillations die out.

A bike is a [[nonholonomic system]] because its outcome is [[Path (topology)|path]]-dependent. In order to know its exact configuration, especially location, it is necessary to know not only the configuration of its parts, but also their histories: how they moved over time. This complicates mathematical analysis.<ref name="fajans" />

Finally, in the language of [[control theory]], a bike exhibits [[Minimum phase#mixed phase|non-minimum phase]] behavior.<ref>{{cite web
| title = Counter-Intuitive.

It turns in the direction opposite of how it is initially steered, as described above in the section on [[Bicycle and motorcycle dynamics#countersteering|countersteering]]

===Equations of motion===
The [[Equation of motion|equations of motion]] of an idealized bike, consisting of
*a rigid [[bicycle frame|frame]],
*a rigid [[bicycle fork|fork]],
*two knife-edged, rigid [[bicycle wheel|wheels]],
*all connected with frictionless bearings and rolling without friction or slip on a smooth horizontal surface and
*operating at or near the upright and straight ahead unstable equilibrium

can be represented by two [[Linearization|linearized]] second-order [[ordinary differential equation]]s,<ref name="hand" /> the lean equation
:<math> M_{\theta\theta}\ddot{\theta_r} +
        K_{\theta\theta}\theta_r +
        M_{\theta\psi}\ddot{\psi} +
        C_{\theta\psi}\dot{\psi} +
        K_{\theta\psi}\psi =
        M_{\theta}
</math>
and the steer equation
:<math> M_{\psi\psi}\ddot{\psi} +
        C_{\psi\psi}\dot{\psi} +
        K_{\psi\psi}\psi +
        M_{\psi\theta}\ddot{\theta_r} +
        C_{\psi\theta}\dot{\theta_r} +
        K_{\psi\theta}\theta_r =
        M_{\psi}\mbox{,}
</math>
where 
*<math>\theta_r</math> is the lean angle of the rear assembly,
*<math>\psi</math> is the steer angle of the front assembly relative to the rear assembly and
*<math>M_{\theta}</math> and <math>M_{\psi}</math> are the moments (torques) applied at the rear assembly and the steering axis, respectively. For the analysis of an uncontrolled bike, both are taken to be zero.
These can be represented in matrix form as <math>M\ddot{q}+C\dot{q}+Kq=f</math>
where
*<math>M</math> is the symmetrical mass matrix which contains terms that include only the mass and geometry of the bike,
*<math>C</math> is the so-called damping matrix, even though an idealized bike has no dissipation, which contains terms that include the forward speed <math>V</math> and is asymmetric,
*<math>K</math> is the so-called stiffness matrix which contains terms that include the gravitational constant <math>g</math> and <math>V^2</math> and is symmetric in <math>g</math> and asymmetric in <math>V^2</math>,
*<math>q</math> is a vector of lean angle and steer angle, and
*<math>f</math> is a vector of external forces, the moments mentioned above.

In this idealized and linearized model, there are many [[Bicycle and motorcycle geometry|geometric parameters]] (wheelbase, head angle, mass of each body, wheel radius, etc.), but only four significant variables: lean angle, lean rate, steer angle, and steer rate. These equations have been verified by comparison with multiple numeric models derived completely independently.<ref name="smp" />

===Eigenvalues===
[[Image:BicycleEigenvalues.svg|right|thumb|300px|Eigenvalues plotted against forward speed for a typical [[utility bicycle]]]]

It is possible to calculate [[eigenvalues]], one for each of the four significant variables, from the linearized equations to analyze the self-stability of a particular bike design. In the plot to the right, eigenvalues are calculated for forward speeds of 0–10&nbsp;m/s (22&nbsp;mph). When the [[Real number|real]] parts of all eigenvalues (shown in dark blue) are negative, the bike is self-stable. When the [[Imaginary number|imaginary]] parts of any eigenvalues (shown in cyan) are non-zero, the bike exhibits [[oscillation]].

The forward speed at which oscillations do not increase, eventually causing the uncontrolled bike to fall over, is called the '''weave speed'''. The forward speed at which non-oscillatory leaning does not increase, eventually causing the uncontrolled bike to fall over, is called the '''capsize speed'''.<ref name="Meijaard" /> Between these two speeds, if they both exist, is a range of forward speeds at which the particular bike design is self-stable. In the case of the bike whose eigenvalues are shown here, the self-stable range is 5.3–8.0&nbsp;m/s (12-18&nbsp;mph).

Note that this idealized model does not exhibit the [[Bicycle and motorcycle dynamics#Wobble or shimmy|wobble or shimmy]] and [[Bicycle and motorcycle dynamics#Rear wobble|rear wobble]] instabilities described above. They are seen in models that incorporate tire interaction with the ground.<ref name="Cossalter" />

==Experimentation==
A variety of experiments have been performed in order to verify or disprove various hypotheses about bike dynamics.
* [[David E. H. Jones|David Jones]] built several bikes in a search for an unridable configuration.<ref name="jones"/>
* Richard Klein built several bikes to confirm Jones's findings.<ref name="klein"/>
* Richard Klein also built a "Torque Wrench Bike" and a "Rocket Bike" to investigate steering torques and their effects.<ref name="klein"/>
* Keith Code built a motorcycle with fixed handlebars to investigate the effects of rider motion and position on steering.<ref name="code">{{cite news

==Other hypotheses==<!-- This section is linked from [[Bad science]] -->
Although bicycles and motorcycles can appear to be simple mechanisms with only four major moving parts ([[bicycle frame|frame]], [[bicycle fork|fork]], and two [[bicycle wheel|wheels]]), these parts are arranged in a way that makes them quite complicated to analyze.<ref name="whitt" /> 

While it is an observable fact that bikes can be ridden even when the [[Gyroscopic#Properties|gyroscopic effects]] of their wheels are canceled out,<ref name="jones" /><ref name="klein" /> the hypothesis that the gyroscopic effects of the wheels are what keep a bike upright is common in print and online.<ref name="klein" /><ref name="fajans" />
