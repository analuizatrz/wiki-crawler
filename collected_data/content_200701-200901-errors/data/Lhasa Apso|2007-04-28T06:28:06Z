The '''Lhasa Apso''' is a small [[dog breed|breed]] of [[dog]] originally from [[Tibet]].  They were used as watchdogs inside Tibetan [[Monastery|monasteries]] for over 1200 years, for which they are uniquely suited with keen intelligence, acute hearing, and instincts for identifying friends from strangers.

==Appearance==
Lhasas are about 10 to 11 inches at the [[withers]] and weigh about 14-18 pounds.  Bitches are slightly smaller, and weigh between 12-14lbs. The breed standard requires dark brown eyes, with black pigmentation on eye rims and a black nose. Texture of the coat is hard, straight, dense, not woolly or silky. It is often referred to as "moppy". It is of good length, and comes in a variety of colors.  All colors are equally acceptable, with or without black tippings.   The tail should be carried in a tight screw over the back.

== Temperament ==
Having been bred to be sentinel or [[guard dog|watch dog]]s, Lhasa Apsos tend to be alert and have a keen sense of hearing with a rich, sonorous bark that belies their size (some are known as "singers"). Most Lhasas will often bark when something is out of the ordinary, such as if someone is at the door. 

Lhasa Apsos are very intelligent dogs with big personalities. They are bright and outgoing, and although they may tend to be wary of strangers, it is a discerning attitude and not aggressiveness. However, many Lhasas are quite friendly from the first introduction. Lhasas have a very good memory.  They enjoy being spoken to and are capable of learning and understanding hundreds of words. They are very affectionate but can also be very possessive and independent little dogs.  

Many Lhasas are content with indoor living, and are playful. Some love being taken for a walk, while others are content indoors. They are perfect for apartment/condo living.

The Lhasa Apso is a low-shedding breed. While not completely hypo-allergenic, it comes very close. It is cleanest if regularly groomed.  If properly raised it will come to appreciate bathing, hair combing and cutting.

The Lhasa Apso is a long-lived breed, with some living in good health into their early twenties.

==History==

It is believed that the breed originated from Lhasa, the capital of Tibet (hence the name) around [[800s BC|800 BC]]. These dogs were raised by the aristocratic part of the Tibetan society and by Tibetan monks in the monasteries where they were used as guard dogs.  They were very valuable both spiritually and materialistically. To be presented with a Lhasa Apso was to be blessed with good fortune.

Lhasa Apsos have adopted an incentive to be wary of strangers from their owners, who, due to the geographical location of Tibet, were also cautious of outsiders. The heavy coat of Lhasas can also be explained by the geographical features of Tibet: the temperature frequently drops below freezing thus making it hard for a dog to survive without sufficient insulation. Lhasas were rarely groomed by their owners thus allowing the breed to adapt to the harsh weather.

In 1901 Mrs. A. McLaren Morrison brought the Lhasa Apso to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] where it was registered as an official breed in [[The Kennel Club]] in 1902.

[[World War I]] had a devastating effect on the breed. It has been reported that as few as 30 Lhasa Apsos may have existed outside Tibet at that time.

The original American pair was a gift from [[Thubten Gyatso, 13th Dalai Lama]] to C. Suydam Cutting, arriving in the [[United States]] in the early [[1930s]].  The [[American Kennel Club]] officially accepted the breed in 1935 in the Terrier group, and in 1959 transferred the breed to the Non-Sporting group.

Recently, DNA Analysis has identified the Lhasa Apso as one of the 14 most [[ancient dog breeds]].

== Miscellaneous ==
Apparently monks believe that Lhasas are reincarnated [[dalai]]s and as such hold them in high esteem.  Golden Lhasas are said to house the souls of the Dalai Lamas. Lhasas tend to have a very long lifespan of 15-18 years. The oldest living dog in history was a Lhasa, documented 29 years of age in 1939.

The Brazilian comic series [[Monica's Gang]] features a Lhasa Apso named [[Fluffy (Monica's Gang)|Fluffy]] which belongs to [[Jimmy Five]].
