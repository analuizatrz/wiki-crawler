[[Image:Extent of the Hansa.jpg|thumb|300px|Northern Europe in 1400, showing the extent of the Hansa]]

The '''Hanseatic League''' was an [[military alliance|alliance]] of [[trade|trading]] [[guild]]s that established and maintained a trade [[monopoly]] over the [[Baltic Sea]], to a certain extent the [[North Sea]], and most of [[Northern Europe]] for a time in the [[Late Middle Ages]] and the [[early modern period]], between the [[13th century|13th]] and [[17th century|17th]] centuries. 

==History==
Historians generally trace the origins of the League to the foundation of the Northern [[Germany|German]] town of [[Lübeck]], established in [[1158]]/[[1159]] after the capture of the area from the Count of [[Schauenburg]] and [[Holstein]] by [[Henry the Lion]], the [[Duchy of Saxony|Duke of Saxony]]. 

Exploratory trading adventures, [[Raid (military)|raid]]s and [[piracy]] had occurred earlier throughout the Baltic (see [[Viking]]s) — the [[sailor]]s of [[Gotland]] sailed up rivers as far away as [[Novgorod]], for example — but the scale of international [[economic system|economy]] in the Baltic area remained insignificant before the growth of the Hanseatic League. 

German cities achieved domination of trade in the Baltic with striking speed over the next century, and Lübeck became a central node in all the sea-borne trade that linked the areas around the [[North Sea]] and the Baltic Sea. The 15th century saw the climax of Lübeck's hegemony. ([[Visby]], one of the midwives of the Hanseatic league in 1358, declined to become a member. Visby dominated trade in the Baltic before the Hanseatic league, and with its monopolistic ideology, suppressed the [[Gotland]]ic free-trade competition.)

===Foundation===
[[Image:Hanseatic league.jpg|right|Hanseatic League.]]

Lübeck became a base for [[merchant]]s from Saxony and [[Westphalia]] to spread east and north. Well before the term ''Hanse'' appeared in a document ([[1267]]), merchants in a given city began to form [[guilds]] or ''Hansa'' with the intention of trading with towns overseas, especially in the less-developed eastern Baltic area, a source of [[timber]], [[wax]], [[amber]], [[resin]]s, [[fur]]s, even [[rye]] and [[wheat]] brought down on [[barge]]s from the [[hinterland]] to port markets.

Visby functioned as the leading centre in the Baltic before the Hansa. For 100 years the Germans sailed under the Gotlandic flag to Novgorod. Sailing east, Visby merchants established a branch at Novgorod. To begin with the Germans used the Gotlandic Gutagard. With the influx of too many merchants the Gotlanders arranged their own trading stations for the German Petershof further up from the river — see a translation of the grant<ref>[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/1229novgorod-germans.html  Medieval Sourcebook: Privileges Granted to German Merchants at Novgorod, 1229]</ref> of privileges to merchants in [[1229]]. They expanded former Slavic towns and helped establish new German towns into key Hansa towns on and near the east Baltic coast: [[Danzig]] ([[Gdańsk]]), [[Elbing]] (Elblag), [[Toruń|Thorn]] (Toruń), [[Reval]] ([[Tallinn]]), [[Riga]] and [[Dorpat]] ([[Tartu]]), all founded (like others on the Baltic coast) under [[Lübeck law]], which provided that they had to appeal in all legal matters to Lübeck's city council. Before the foundation of the Hanseatic league in 1358 the word ''Hanse'' did not occur in the Baltic. The Gotlanders used the word ''varjag''.

Hansa societies worked to acquire special trade privileges for their members. For example, the merchants of the [[Cologne]] (Köln) Hansa contrived to convince [[Henry II of England]] to grant them (in [[1157]]) special trading privileges and market rights which freed them from all [[London]] tolls and allowed them to trade at fairs throughout [[England]]. The "Queen of the Hansa", Lübeck, where traders trans-shipped goods between the North Sea and the Baltic, gained the Imperial privilege of becoming an [[Imperial Free City|Imperial city]] in [[1227]], the only such city east of the River [[Elbe]].

Lübeck, which had access to the Baltic and North Sea fishing grounds, formed an alliance in 1241 with [[Hamburg]], another trading city, which controlled access to salt-trade routes from [[Lueneburg|Lüneburg]]. The allied cities gained control over most of the [[Curing (food preservation)|salt-fish]] trade, especially the [[Scania Market]]; and Cologne joined them in the [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]] of 1260. In [[1266]] [[Henry III of England]] granted the Lübeck and Hamburg Hansa a charter for operations in England, and the Cologne Hansa joined them in 1282 to form the most powerful Hanseatic colony in London. Much of the drive for this co-operation came from the fragmented nature of existing territorial government, which failed to provide security for trade. Over the next 50 years the Hansa itself emerged with formal agreements for confederation and co-operation covering the west and east trade routes. The chief city and linchpin remained Lübeck; with the first general Diet of the Hansa held there in [[1356]], the Hanseatic League acquired an official structure and could date its official founding.

===Expansion===
[[Image:Haupthandelsroute Hanse.png|thumb|Main trading routes of the Hanseatic League.]]
Lübeck's location on the Baltic provided access for trade with [[Scandinavia]] and [[Russia]], putting it in direct competition with the Scandinavians who had previously controlled most of the Baltic trade routes. A treaty with the [[Visby]] Hansa put an end to competition: through this treaty the Lübeck merchants also gained access to the inland [[Russia]]n port of [[Novgorod]] (center of [[Novgorod Republic]]), where they built a trading post or ''[[Kontor]]''. Other such alliances formed throughout the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The League never became a closely-managed formal organisation. Assemblies of the Hanseatic Towns met irregularly in Lübeck for ''Hansetag'', from 1356 onwards, but many towns chose not to send representatives and decisions were not binding individual cities. Over time, the network of alliances grew to include a flexible roster of 70 to 170 cities <ref>[[Fernand Braudel]]: ''The Perspective of the World''. Vol III of ''Civilisation and Capitalism'' 1984</ref>.

The league succeeded in establishing additional ''Kontors'' in [[Bruges]] (in the [[County of Flanders]], present-day [[Belgium]]), [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]] (Norway) and [[London]] (England). These trading posts became significant [[enclave]]s. The London ''Kontor'', established in 1320, stood west of [[London Bridge]] near Upper Thames Street. ([[Cannon Street station]] occupies the site [[as of 2006|now]].) It grew significantly over time into a walled community with its own warehouses, weighhouse, church, offices and houses, reflecting the importance and scale of the activity carried on. The first reference to it as the [[Steelyard]] (''der Stahlhof'') occurs in [[1422]]. 

In addition to the major Kontors, individual [[Hanseatic ports]] had a representative merchant and warehouse. In England this happened in [[Boston, Lincolnshire|Boston]], [[Bristol]], Bishop's Lynn (now [[King's Lynn]]), which features the sole remaining Hanseatic warehouse in England, [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[Ipswich]], [[Norwich]], Yarmouth (now Great [[Great Yarmouth|Yarmouth]]) and [[York]].

The League primarily traded timber, furs, resin (or tar), flax, honey, wheat and rye from the east to Flanders and England with cloth (and, increasingly, manufactured goods) going in the other direction. Metal ore (principally copper and iron) and herring came southwards from Sweden.

[[Image:Tallinn & Helsinki 046 - Tallinn Town Hall.jpeg|thumb|left|Town Hall of Reval (now [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]]).]]
German colonists under strict Hansa supervision built numerous Hansa cities in the Baltic: towns like Reval ([[Tallinn]]), [[Riga]], and Dorpat ([[Tartu]]), some of which still retain many Hansa buildings and bear the style of their Hanseatic days. [[Livonia]] incorporated parts of modern-day [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]] and had its own Hanseatic parliament (diet); all of its major towns became members of the Hanseatic League. The dominant language of trade was ''Mittelniederdeutsch'' ([[Middle Low German]]), a dialect  with significant impact for countries involved in the trade, particularly the larger [[Scandinavian languages]].

===Zenith===
Danzig ([[Gdańsk]]), along with other important Hansa cities including Thorn ([[Toruń]]) and Elbing ([[Elbląg]]) was incorporated into [[Poland]] at the [[Second Treaty of Toruń]] in [[1466]]. [[Kraków]], then the capital of Poland, was also a Hansa city. The lack of customs borders on the River [[Vistula]] after 1466 helped to gradually increase Polish grain export, transported to the sea down the Vistula, from 10,000 [[tonne|t]] per year in the late 15th century to over 200,000 [[tonne|t]] in the 17th century<ref>Norman Davies ''God's playground. A history of Poland'', Columbia University Press, 1982</ref>. The Hansa dominated maritime grain trade made Poland one of the main areas of its activity helping Danzig to become the Hansa's largest city due to its control of Polish grain exports.

The League had a fluid structure, but its members shared some characteristics. First, most of the Hanseatic League (or Hansa) cities either started as independent cities or gained independence through the collective bargaining power of the League. Such independence remained, however, limited; it meant that the Hansa cities in Germany owed allegiance directly to the Emperor of the day, without any intermediate tie to the local nobility. Another similarity involved the cities' strategic locations along trade routes. In fact, at the height of its power in the late [[1300s]], the merchants of the Hanseatic League succeeded in using their economic clout (and sometimes their military might - trade routes needed protecting, and the League's ships sailed well-armed) to influence Imperial policy.

The League also wielded power abroad: between [[1368]] and [[1370]], Hansa ships unified in the [[Confederation of Cologne]] fought against the Danes, and forced King [[Valdemar IV of Denmark]] to grant the League 15 percent of the profits from Danish trade ([[Treaty of Stralsund]], 1370) and an effective trade monopoly in Scandinavia. The Hansa also waged a vigorous campaign against pirates. Between [[1392]] and [[1440]] maritime trade of the League faced danger from raids of the [[Victual Brothers]] and their descendants, a mighty [[brotherhood]] of [[privateer]]s hired in [[1392]] by [[Albert of Sweden|Albrecht of Mecklenburg]] against the Danish queen [[Margaret I of Denmark|Margaret I]]. In the [[Dutch-Hanseatic War]] ([[1438]] — [[1441]]) the merchants of Amsterdam sought and eventually won free access to the Baltic and broke the Hansa monopoly. As an essential part of protecting their investment in trade and ships, the League trained [[Pilot (harbour)|pilot]]s and erected lighthouses.

Exclusive trade routes often came at a high price. Most foreign cities confined the Hansa traders to certain trading areas and to their own trading posts. They could seldom, if ever, interact with the local inhabitants, except in the matter of actual negotiation. Moreover, many people, merchant and noble alike, envied the power of the League. For example, in London the local merchants exerted continuing pressure for the revocation of the privileges of the League. The refusal of the ''Hanse'' to offer reciprocal arrangements to their English counterparts exacerbated the tension. [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] reconfirmed the league's privileges in the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1474)]] despite this hostility — in part thanks to the significant financial contribution the League made to the Yorkist side during [[The Wars of the Roses]]. A century later, in [[1597]], [[Elizabeth I]] expelled the League from London and the [[Steelyard]] closed in [[1598]]. The very existence of the League and its privileges and monopolies created economic and social tensions that often crept over into rivalry between League members.

===Downfall===
The economic crises of the late [[14th century]] did not spare the Hansa. Nevertheless, its eventual rivals emerged in the form of the [[Nation state|territorial states]], whether new or revived, and not just in the west: [[Poland]] triumphed over the [[Teutonic Knights]] in [[1466]]; [[Ivan III of Russia]] ended the entrepreneurial independence of Novgorod in [[1478]]. New [[Medium of exchange|vehicles of credit]] imported from [[Italy]] outpaced the Hansa economy, in which silver coin changed hands rather than bills of exchange.

In the 14th century, tensions between Prussia and the Wendish cities (Lübeck and neighbours) rose. Lübeck was dependent on its role as centre of the Hansa, being on the shore of the sea without a major river. Lübeck was on the entrance of the land route to Hamburg, but this land route could be circumvented by the sea travel around Denmark and through the Sound. Prussia's main interest on the other hand was primarily of exporting bulk products like grain and timber, which were very important for England, the Low Countries and later on also for Spain and Italy. 

A major benefit for the Hansa was its domination of the shipbuilding market, mainly in Lübeck and in the Prussian city of Danzig. The Hansa sold ships everywhere in Europe including Italy. 

The Hansa had excluded the Hollanders from the Hansa, because it wanted to favour Bruges as a huge staple market at the end of a trade route. The Hollanders regarded themselves as Germans and were part of the same Empire as Lübeck, still they weren't allowed to be part of the German Hansa. When the Hollanders started to become competitors of the Hansa in shipbuilding, the Hansa tried to stop the flow of shipbuilding technology from Hansa towns to Holland. Prussian Danzig didn't fall for it and tried to stall the decision. Dutch ships sailed to Danzig to take grain from the Prussians directly, to the dismay of Lübeck. The staple market from Bruges was moved to Antwerp. Bruges, Antwerp and Holland all became part of the same country, Burgundy, which actively tried to take over the monopoly of trade from the Hansa. The power of the Hansa was broken when Hollanders and Prussians became trading partners and didn't care anymore about Lübeck except for ending its position as a leading trading town.

Hollanders circumvented the Hansa towns by trading directly with North German princes in non-Hansa towns. Dutch freight costs were much lower than those of the Hansa, and the Hansa were excluded as middlemen. Nürnberg developed an overland route to sell formerly Hansa monopolized products from Frankfurt via Nürnberg and Leipzig to Poland and Russia, trading Flemish cloth and French wine in exchange for grain and furs from the east. The Hansa could only profit from the Nürnberg trade by allowing Nürnbergers to settle in Hansa towns, which the Nürnbergers exploited by taking over trade with Sweden as well.  

In 1466, the Western Prussian towns rose against the dominance of the Teutonic Order and asked for help of the Polish king. Danzig, Thorn and Kulm became loyal German speaking citizens of Poland who traded with the Dutch. The famous astronomer Copernicus lived in Thorn during this time. {{lopsided}}

The Dutch merchants aggressively challenged the Hansa and met with much success. Hanseatic cities in Prussia, Livonia and Poland supported the [[Netherlands]] against the core cities of the Hansa in northern Germany. After several naval wars between the [[Burgundian Circle|Burgundian]] and the Hanseatic fleets, [[Amsterdam]] gained the position of leading port for Polish and Baltic grain from the late 15th century onwards. The Dutch regarded Amsterdam's grain trade as the mother of all trades (''Moedernegotie''). [[Denmark]] and [[England]] tried to destroy the [[Seventeen Provinces|Netherlands]] in the early 16th century, but failed.

At the start of the 16th century the League found itself in a weaker position than it had known for many years. The rising [[Swedish Empire]] had taken control of much of the Baltic. Denmark had regained control over its own trade, the Kontor in Novgorod had closed and the Kontor in [[Bruges]] had become effectively defunct. The individual cities which made up the League had also started to put self-interest before their common Hansa interests.  Finally the political authority of the German princes had started to grow — and so to constrain the independence of action which the merchants and Hanseatic Towns had enjoyed.
[[Image:Heinrich Sudermann.jpg|thumb|Heinrich Sudermann]]
The League attempted to deal with some of these issues. It created the post of [[Syndic]] in [[1556]] and elected [[Heinrich Sudermann]]<ref>[[:de:Heinrich Sudermann]]</ref> as permanent official with legal training who worked to protect and extend the diplomatic agreements of the member towns. In [[1557]] and [[1579]] revised agreements spelled out the duties of towns and some progress was made.  The [[Bruges]] Kontor moved to Antwerp and the Hansa attempted to pioneer new routes.  However, the League proved unable to halt the progress around it and so a long decline commenced.  The Antwerp Kontor closed in [[1593]], followed by the London Kontor in [[1598]]. The Bergen Kontor continued until [[1754]]: its buildings alone of all the Kontoren survive (see [[Bryggen]]).

===The end===
By the late [[16th century]], the League imploded and could no longer deal with its own internal struggles, the social and political changes that accompanied the [[Reformation]], the rise of Dutch and English merchants, and the incursion of the [[Ottoman Turks]] upon its trade routes and upon the Holy Roman Empire itself. Only nine members attended the last formal meeting in [[1669]] and only three (Lübeck, Hamburg and Bremen) remained as members until its final demise in [[1862]]{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.

Despite its collapse, several cities still maintain the link to the Hanseatic League [[as of 2006|today]]. Even in the [[21st century]], the cities of [[Deventer]], [[Kampen, Netherlands|Kampen]], [[Zutphen]], [[Lübeck]], [[Hamburg]], [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]], [[Rostock]], [[Wismar]], [[Stralsund]], [[Greifswald]] and [[Anklam]] call themselves ''Hanse'' cities. For Lübeck in particular, this anachronistic tie to a glorious past remained especially important in the second half of the [[20th century]]. Lübeck, [[Hamburg]] and [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]] continue to style themselves officially as "(Free) (and) Hanseatic Cities". The [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] removed this privilege through the [[Gesetz über Groß-Hamburg und andere Gebietsbereinigungen|''Greater Hamburg Act, 1937'']] after the Senat of Lübeck did not permit [[Adolf Hitler]] to speak in Lübeck during his election campaign<ref>[http://www.europealacarte.co.uk/Germany/lubeck.html Guide to Lubeck</ref>. He held the speech in [[Bad Schwartau]], a small village on the outskirts of Lübeck. Subsequently he always referred to Lübeck as "the small city close to Bad Schwartau".

==Lists of former Hansa cities==
In the list that follows, the role of these foreign merchant companies in the functioning of the city that was their host, in more than one sense is, as [[Fernand Braudel]]<ref>Braudel</ref> pointed out, a telling criterion of the status of that city: "If he rules the roost in a given city or region, the foreign merchant is a sign of the [economic] inferiority of that city or region, compared with the economy of which he is the emissary or representative".

Hanseatic League merchant caravans are used as the backdrop for "living history" groups in Florida and North Carolina. [http://www.hanseatic-league.com/ Hanseatic League Historical Re-enactors] has two chapters, "'''Bergens Kontor'''" in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and "'''Voss Kontor'''" in Fayetteville, North Carolina. Both groups portray merchants from a '''Hanseatic League merchant caravan''' originating from ''kontors'' and towns in Norway. They offer "''in character''" lectures, skits and "theatre in the round", based on the history of the Hanseatic League, for the education and entertainment of Renaissance Festival patrons and local schools.

Robert Heinlein's novel, "Citizen of the Galaxy," revolves around a loose league of trading spaceships of varying old Earth nationalities like the Finns aboard the "Sisu."  Another ship is called "Hansea."

Barrie Jay Moynihan refers to the Hanseatic League in his recently withdrawn fiction novel with describes the dilemmas presented to a local landowner Fergus Crothur Ceilleacher who was based in hinterland of Tralee during the Act of Union 1601.
