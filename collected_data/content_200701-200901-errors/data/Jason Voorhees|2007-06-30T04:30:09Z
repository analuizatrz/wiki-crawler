'''Jason Voorhees''' is the main [[fictional character]] from the [[Friday the 13th (series)|''Friday the 13th'' series]] of [[slasher film]]s. A vicious [[mass murder]]er, he has a presence in all of the films, even when he is not the killer.  With his trademark hockey [[goalie mask]] and [[machete]], he is arguably among the most recognizable villains from any slasher film.  Throughout the series, Jason has never spoken aside from when he drowned as a child, and from occasional mumbles, grunts, and groans, and a few words in the eighth and ninth film of the series, the latter when he possessed another man's body.  Jason is credited as having been created by [[Victor Miller (writer)|Victor Miller]], the screenwriter of the first ''Friday the 13th'' film, in spite of the fact that he barely appeared in that film and much controversy exists about his creation, with [[Ron Kurz]] and [[Tom Savini]] both arguing they deserve some of the credit.  For his part, Miller has gone on record as saying he has avoided watching the sequel films and that he has great reservations about how Jason has been handled.<ref name="Victor Miller on the sequels">{{cite web | url=http://www.victormiller.com/faq/index.html#q11 | title=Friday the 13th sequels | publisher=VictorMiller.com | accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref>

==Character biography==
===Childhood years===

Little about Jason's life prior to his drowning at Camp Crystal Lake has been explored in the films. It is established that he was born [[June 13]], [[1946]] to [[Pamela Voorhees]]. Most other details have been left untouched by the film series, the gaps filled in by the novelizations of the early films (particularly for ''Part 2''). The [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] nature of these novels are unclear, but a few details have been incorporated into later films, such as [[Elias Voorhees]] being the name of Jason's father. Outside of the ''Jason Lives'' novelization, Elias has not been depicted in any media, his ties to Jason's back-story left unclear in the series, although he was mentioned by name in ''[[Jason Goes To Hell: The Final Friday]]''. 

Jason's mental abilities and possible retardation have not been officially addressed, and have been depicted with conflicting evidence by both the films and outside sources. Jason's deformed look and [[hydrocephalus|hydrocephalic]] features are also unclear when taking other sources into consideration. The novelizations are explicit that Jason was born physically normal, having developed the deformation seen onscreen through a "regeneration ability" while he had been at the bottom of Crystal Lake. Adding to this is that [[Victor Miller (writer)|Victor Miller]] has stated that Jason was originally conceived of as a normal child akin to the novelizations.<ref>http://www.campcrystallake.com/interviews/victormiller.htm Victor Miller on Jason's design as a boy.</ref>
[[Image:Friday2jasonmask.jpg|205px|thumb|left|Jason's hood in ''[[Friday the 13th Part 2]]'']]

However a flash back of Jason drowning in the original film clearly shows a deformed head; this combined with his mother saying "Jason should have been watched, every minute, every second. He was-" and then pausing to add "he wasn't a very good swimmer" hints that Jason's mother was about to admit that Jason was retarded or her son before catching herself and correcting herself. It was [[Tom Savini]] who designed the deformed look seen in the film. Supporting this scenerio is the fact that in ''Jason Takes Manhattan'' Jason's visage appears frequently to one of the main characters, his appearance growing from normal to deformed with each appearance. Later films, specifically ''Jason X'', have taken the concept of Jason possessing a regenerative ability. Despite this, there has yet to be anything surrounding Jason's drowning directly addressed in the film series. The closest thing that refutes the novels' explanation is in ''Freddy vs. Jason'', the more recent of the films, in which a dream sequence from Jason's own mind depicts him as a young child at the camp with his characteristic deformities. However, how trust-worthy this perspective is left to debate.
[[Image:Jasonunmask.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Jason's horribly disfigured face in ''[[Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter]]''.]]

The only established facts retained through the films' continuity is that Jason supposedly drowned at Camp Crystal Lake in [[1957]], his body never found. This incident drives his mother to take revenge on those she feels were responsible. After the camp is closed due to the murder of two counselors she had killed, Mrs. Voorhees goes to great lengths to keep the camp from reopening. Her final attempt is a killing spree that ends with her own [[decapitation]] in the sole survivor's act of self-defense.  It has also been said that the camp counselors were, instead of saving Jason from drowning, having sex, therefore causing Jason's mother to kill them. Although it was not explained that if Jason did survive the drowning and managed to become a full grown man (albeit with a warped mind), why he did not try and seek out his mother to inform her of his survival. Although it would explain that just as Pamela felt she needed to seek revenge for Jason's apparent death; Jason felt the need for revenge when he witnessed his mother's death from afar.

===Resurface===
Based on the information given in the films, it's presumed that Jason acts out his first murder on [[Alice Hardy]], the woman responsible for his mother's death just two months earlier. It's further suggested that soon after he retreats to the deserted grounds of Camp Crystal Lake and makes his home in a crudely built shack with his mother's severed head in his possession.[[Image:Jasongetshockey.png‎|200px|left|thumb|In ''[[Friday the 13th Part 3|Part 3]]'', Jason gets his trademark hockey mask.]]
It is not until five years later does Jason begin a seemingly unstoppable killing spree when two counselors in the adjacent training center sneak onto the closed off area. This event triggers Jason to leave the grounds to kill over thirty victims during the course of a few days as depicted in the second, third, and fourth films in the series. During his spree there are attempts to stop Jason by the few survivors, but none are entirely successful until a young [[Tommy Jarvis]] drives a machete deep into his skull and then repeatedly strikes him again and again. This evidently ends Jason's reign of terror, but the cost is Tommy's own mental health and he spends several years in various [[psychiatric hospital]]s. It is during this time that Jason has been buried. According to the ''Jason Lives'' novelization and screenplay, Jason's father intervened to keep his son from being [[cremated]] by paying for a proper burial.

===Return from the grave===
As made clear in ''[[Friday the 13th: A New Beginning|A New Beginning]]'', in which copycat killer [[Roy Burns]] assumes Jason's identity to exact revenge for the death of his son, Tommy Jarvis is still haunted years later by his encounter with Jason. ''[[Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives|Jason Lives]]'' begins with Tommy taking a friend to help him dig up and cremate Jason to make sure that he will not return. However, seeing Jason again stirs memories and Tommy, mirroring his mad attack at the climax of ''[[Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter|The Final Chapter]]'', stabs the rotting corpse repeatedly with a metal rod. Soon the rod attracts lightning and the burst of electricity brings Jason back to life in a fashion modeled after ''[[Frankenstein]]''. With a stronger and more invulnerable Jason roaming back to the Crystal Lake (renamed Forest Green as part of the town's efforts to distance itself from Crystal Lake's violent history), Tommy devises a plan. Luring him onto the middle of the lake, returning Jason to where he drowned, and chains him to the bottom of the lake. Tommy assumes Jason is "home" and is never seen in any of the subsequent films.
[[Image:Jasonlivesagain.jpg‎|right|thumb|225px|Jason's corpse revived by a strike of lightning in ''[[Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives|Part 6]]'']]
When ''[[Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood|The New Blood]]'' begins Jason's body remains chained in lake's waters some years later after the events of the previous film. His dormant body is resurrected again via the [[psychokinesis]] ability of a young woman who had accidentally killed her father with the same powers in the same lake. After using these powers once again she somehow uses her abilities to revive her father, who leaps out of the lake and pulls Jason back into the lake.  Jason is brought back again at unspecified time later in the eighth film, ''[[Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan|Jason Takes Manhattan]]''. Brought to life once more with electricity, he boards a cruise ship named ''Lazarus'' and kills several high school graduates on their way to [[New York]], and continues to hunt the few survivors of the sunken ship onto the city's streets. In the climax of the film, Jason is caught up in a flood of toxic waste that is pumped in Manhattan's sewer system. The fate of Jason in this event remains debated as the only evidence of him when the waste clears is a young Jason, free of any deformities. As the film depicts one of the characters seeing flashes of Jason, it is possible that this is a mere psychic allusion and not a physical representation of Jason. The confusion of this ending is furthered by ''Jason Goes To Hell'' which begins with Jason already alive, never explaining how he escaped the waste in New York.

===To Hell and clash with Freddy Krueger===
Regardless of how he had survived and made his way back to Crystal Lake, the ninth film opens with Jason caught in the sights of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]. He is overpowered and quickly blown apart. It is established in the film that though Jason's body has been destroyed, his spirit lies in his untouched heart. It is this physical manifestation of his soul that passes from host-to-host in a quest to find another Voorhees, the only means by which he can be [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] into his familiar form; but a Voorhees also possesses the only power to destroy him. Once reborn through his sister's body, his niece takes up a special dagger empowered by her bloodline, and uses it against Jason, sending him to Hell. Afterwards his mask is on the ground when a clawed glove bursts out from the ground and drags it down.
[[Image:Freddy_vs_jason_promo.jpg|left|thumb|225px|''[[Freddy vs. Jason]]''.]]
When ''[[Freddy vs. Jason]]'' begins Jason is living out previous murders while in [[Hell]]. During this he is provoked by his mother to "wake up", which results in a physical resurrection. However, it turns out that Jason was brought back not by his mother, but by [[Freddy Krueger]], the supernatural [[serial killer]] of the ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (series)|The Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' films who can manipulate dreams. Freddy's objective is to use Jason as a mere tool to kill the children of Springwood so they will be attributed to Krueger and thus produce enough fear to restore his powers. However, Jason turns out to be too much for Freddy to control and Freddy resorts to his renewed powers to bring Jason into his world. The battle ultimately spills out from the dream world into the real world. Though [[Lori Campbell]] tries to help Jason in defeating Freddy, both Jason and Freddy fall into the water; Jason from massive wounds and Freddy by Jason impaling him with Freddy's own arm.

Jason is later seen leaving the lake with Freddy's severed head in tow. Because the head is seen winking, the nature of who won remains ambiguous.

=== The Future ===
[[image:UberJason.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The new and improved "Über-Jason" as depicted in ''[[Jason X]]'']]
The tenth film establishes that in the year 2008 in the relatively near-future, Jason is being held as a prisoner in the Crystal Lake Research Facility (presumably built on the site of what was once Camp Crystal Lake). After several failed attempts to execute Voorhees, it is decided that he shall be held in [[Cryopreservation|cryonic suspension]]. Jason briefly escapes when the military attempt to take him away (presumably for use as a weapon) but is eventually trapped in a freezing chamber. Over four hundred years later, after Earth has become uninhabitable and its populace relocated to "Earth Two", Jason is found, still frozen, by a ship populated by students and soldiers. After being brought on board, and assumed dead, he thaws and begins killing as usual until he is effectively stopped by an android who destroys large portions of his body. His remains are abandoned on a bed used to help regenerate tissue via nanotechnology. Using the metal around them, the [[nanotechnology]] helps to rebuild Jason with an armored body, providing him more strength and seeming invulnerability, this new Jason is referred to as "Über-Jason" in the credits of the movie. The remaining survivors of the ship exhaust every effort to hold him back and eventually escape, leaving Uber-Jason on a doomed space vessel. Jason apparently survives the vacuum of space to attempt an attack on the rescue ship but is tackled into Earth Two's atmosphere by a surviving soldier in a space-suit.

Jason is shown then burning-up upon entering Earth Two's atmosphere, although his hockey mask at least is shown to have survived the crash, ending its descent at the bottom of a body of water. Jason's fate after this incident has so far only been addressed in comics and novels, which are not necessarily [[canon (fiction)|canon]]. However, even if he is alive (and in one piece) it will take some time for even Jason to recuperate (even based upon his argued "recuperating abilities").

==Appearances outside the films==
[[Image:Jasonbooks2.jpg|thumb|right|235px|''Jason vs Leatherface'' and ''Friday the 13th:Hate-Kill-Repeat'' released in 1995 and 2005 (respectively), attempted to expand on the Jason character]]
Jason has also appeared in other media outside of the film series. Though some of these are adaption, the canonicity of anything outside of the events depicted onscreen is unknown. These appearance include [[Friday the 13th (comics)|several comic books]] and even makes a cameo appearance in the fourth issue of ''Satan's Six'' that follows the end of ''Jason Goes to Hell''. He has also starred in two different [[Friday the 13th (video game)|video games]]<ref>http://www.thelogbook.com/phosphor/c64/2006/f.htm Review of Commodore 64 version</ref> and several [[Friday the 13th (film series)#Books|books]].

Jason has also appeared in other unofficial media. The image of Jason has littered popular culture due to the popularity of the ''Friday the 13th'' films. This began with the release of the third film in which the character first wears the hockey mask. Since then the hockey mask itself has become synonymous with the character and therefore the franchise. Oftentimes, the mere appearance of a character wearing a hockey mask, especially when imitating situations from a horror film, evoke the idea of Jason. To this extent the general appearance of Jason has more of an impact in the collective public than any particular film in the series. Images of Jason, or depictions of characters in hockey masks, have appeared in various films and television shows. These are used either for parody or as an homage. Dozens of direct references have been spotted in various media. One website maintains a near-comprehensive list.<ref>http://www.fridaythe13thfilms.com/media/references.html. List of other media references.</ref>

==The men behind the masks==
Much like his masked counterpart [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]], the part of Jason Voorhees has been played by various actors, some uncredited, others taking great pride in the role. Due to the physical demands the character required and the lack of emotional depth depicted, it comes as no surprise that almost all of the actors are [[stunt double|stuntmen]] with no pre-existing history solely in acting.  The best known among them is [[Kane Hodder]], who has become a favorite among fans and is often cited as the best to take up the role.<ref>[http://dvd.ign.com/articles/372/372345p1.html ''Jason X'' review]</ref><ref>[http://home.comcast.net/~zombiephilia/freddy%20vs%20jason.htm ''Freddy vs. Jason'' review]</ref><ref>[http://www.retrocrush.com/horror/index.html Retrocrush: The 100 Greatest Horror Movie Performers]</ref>

In the original ''Friday the 13th'', [[Ari Lehman]] portrayed a young Jason, seen only in a brief flashback and at the very end. Although he is not the only actor to portray a young Jason, he is the first actor to ever play Jason Voorhees.

For the role of the first adult Jason, some controversy arose over the role in ''Part 2''. While Warrington Gillette is credited as Jason, the majority of the role was actually played by Steve Daskewisz, who was simply credited as the stunt double. Gillette only played the role in the unmasked scene, with Daskewisz playing the role in almost all of the character's other scenes except the opening scene, which was done by Ellen Lutter and some feet, hands and shadow shots done by Jerry Wallace. Although this credit was corrected of sorts in ''Part 3'' (in which Daskewisz is credited as Jason for the reused footage from the climax of the film), this confusion existed for years until the publication of ''Making Friday the 13th'' by David Grove and ''Crystal Lake Memories'' by Peter Bracke.

Daskewisz was asked to reprise his role in the third film, but turned it down simply because of the money he would have had to put out during filming, a decision he says he later regretted.<ref>[http://www.campcrystallake.com/interviews/stevedash.htm 13 Questions with...Steve Dash]</ref> Instead, the role went to Richard Brooker, a [[trapeze]] artist cast simply because of his big frame. He took the role believing that dialogue was not a necessity to acting.<ref name="hellmag">''Jason Goes To Hell: The Final Friday - The Official Movie Magazine'': "The Other Jasons"</ref>

More controversy stirred for the part in ''The Final Chapter'', when the role was handed over to professional stunt man [[Ted White (stunt man)|Ted White]]. White refused credit for the role, feeling bad about the treatment of the actors who played the victims, and claiming that he took the role solely for the money, not wanting his name on what he called a "piece of shit."<ref name="hellmag"/> He was later cited as saying that the film came out better than he had expected<ref name="hellmag"/>. He is credited in reused footage for later films.

Much like with ''Part 2'', there has been confusion over the role in ''A New Beginning'', partly due to the crediting of the killer and not Jason himself. While Dick Wieand is credited as [[Roy Burns]], the film's actual murderer, it was stuntman Tom Morga who performed in the few flashes of Jason, as well as portraying Roy in almost all but the unmasked scenes. A veteran stunt man named John Hock (also known as John Hocks Conrad) did the fall onto the spikes, while an unknown actor played Jason in the opening sequence. Wieand has been outspoken about his lack of enthusiasm over his role in the film.<ref name="hellmag"/>

[[C.J. Graham]] auditioned for the role in the sixth film. He initially lost the role, but was called back five days later for the role when the hired stuntman, Dan Bradley, failed to give the desired performance<ref name="hellmag"/> (Bradley can still be seen in the paintball sequence in the film). A nightclub owner with a military history, Graham performed almost all of his own stunts in the role. Although he was passed over for reprising the role, he has spoken highly of his time in the part, and is even willing to reprise the role should he ever be asked.<ref name="hellmag"/><ref name="fvjmag"/>

[[Kane Hodder]] first played Jason in ''The New Blood'', also playing the role in ''Jason Takes Manhattan'', ''Jason Goes To Hell'', and ''Jason X''. He remains the only actor to reprise the role. His strong following caused obvious upset among fans when he was turned down for ''Freddy vs. Jason''.

For ''Freddy vs. Jason'', the role went to [[Ken Kirzinger]], a Canadian stuntman who worked on ''Jason Takes Manhattan'' (He also played Jason in Jason Takes Manhattan in the scene where Jason was run over and when he chased Rennie and Sean in the subway) .  There have been conflicting reports over the reason behind the casting of Kirzinger, although many believe that it may have simply been due to his residence in [[Canada]], where the film was shot, and thus done to save money.<ref>[http://www.joblo.com/arrow/index.php?id=486 Arrow in the Head 2003 interview with Kane Hodder]</ref><ref>http://www.horrorseek.com/horror/realm/freddyvsjason.htm</ref>  Additionally, according to director Ronny Yu, Kirzinger was hired because he was taller than Freddy actor [[Robert Englund]]. Ken stands 6'5" compared to the 6'3" Kane Hodder, and Ronny Yu wanted a much larger actor to tower over Englund (who stands an average 5'10"). Yu also wanted someone with more "sympathetic eyes."<ref> Crystal Lake Memories: The Complete History of Friday the 13th, Peter M Bracke 2006 ISBN 1845763432 </ref>
