'''Madness''' is a [[Briton|British]] [[Pop music|pop]]/[[ska]] band from [[Camden Town]], [[London]], that formed in 1976.<ref name="madness76"> {{cite web|url= http://www.madness.co.uk/time/1976/text.htm  |title= The Madness Timeline: 1976 }} Retrieved on [[June 5]], [[2007]].</ref> As of 2007, the band has continued to perform with their most recognised lineup of seven members, although their lineup has varied slightly over the years. They were one of the most prominent bands of the late-1970s [[2 Tone]] ska revival.<ref name="allmusic"> Erlewine, Stephen Thomas. {{cite web|url= http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:wifqxqe5ldfe~T1|title= "Allmusic.com 'Madness' biography" }} Retrieved on [[June 19]], [[2007]].</ref> <ref name="allmusic"/>

Madness achieved most of their success in the 1980s.  Both Madness and [[UB40]] spent exactly 214 weeks on the UK singles charts over the course of the decade, holding the record for most weeks spent by a group in the 1980s UK singles charts.  However, Madness achieved this in a a shorter time period (1980-1986).<ref>Rice 1990. p286</ref><ref>For Madness, the figure of 214 weeks does not include the 4 weeks on the charts by spin-off band "The Madness".

==Career==
===1976–1978: Formation===
The core of the band formed as '''The North London Invaders''' in [[1976]] (although their name was often shortened to '''The Invaders'''), and included [[Mike Barson]] (Monsieur Barso) on [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]] and [[singer|vocals]], [[Chris Foreman]] (Chrissy Boy) on [[Electric guitar|guitar]] and [[Lee Jay Thompson|Lee Thompson]] (Kix) on [[saxophone]] and vocals.<ref name="madness76"/> They later recruited John Hasler on [[Drum kit|drums]] and Cathal Smyth (better known as [[Chas Smash]]) on [[bass guitar]]. Later in the year, they were joined by lead vocalist "Dikron".<ref name="madness76"/>

[[Image:Madness logo.gif|right]]This six-piece lineup lasted until part way through [[1977]], when [[Graham McPherson]] (better known as Suggs) took over the lead vocals after seeing the band perform in a friend's [[Yard (land)|garden]].<ref name="madness77"> {{cite web|url= http://www.madness.co.uk/time/1977/text.htm  |title= The Madness Timeline: 1977 }} Retrieved on [[June 5]], [[2007]].</ref> [[Cathal Smyth|Smyth]], who was poor on [[bass guitar]], was replaced by Gavin Rogers, an acquaintance of Barson.<ref name="madness77"/> McPherson was kicked out of the band for too often choosing to watch [[Football (soccer)|football]] instead of rehearsing.<ref name="madness78"> {{cite web|url= http://www.madness.co.uk/time/1978/text.htm  |title= The Madness Timeline: 1978 }} Retrieved on [[June 5]], [[2007]].</ref> Thompson left the band after Barson criticised his [[saxophone]] playing.<ref name="madness78"/> 

By [[1978]], the band had allowed McPherson to return, after filling in temporarily for Hasler (who had taken over vocals when McPherson was removed).<ref name="madness78"/> Thompson returned after patching things up with Barson, and [[Daniel Woodgate]] (Woody) and [[Mark Bedford]] (Bedders) also joined the band, on drums, replacing Garry Dovey, and bass guitar, replacing Gavin Rogers, respectively.<ref name="madness78"/> After briefly changing their name to '''Morris and the Minors''', the band renamed itself as Madness; paying homage to one of their favourite songs by [[ska]]/[[reggae]] artist [[Prince Buster]].<ref name="madness79"> {{cite web|url= http://www.madness.co.uk/time/1979/text.htm  |title= The Madness Timeline: 1979 }} Retrieved on [[June 5]], [[2007]].</ref> The band remained a sextet until late 1979, when Chas Smash rejoined and officially became the seventh member of Madness as a [[backing vocalist]] and [[trumpet]] player.<ref name="madness79"/>

In [[1979 in music|1979]], the band recorded the [[Lee Jay Thompson|Lee Thompson]] composition "[[The Prince (song)|The Prince]]".<ref name="madness79"/> The song, like the band's name, paid homage to their idol, [[Prince Buster]]. The song was released through [[2 Tone Records]], the label of [[The Specials]] founder [[Jerry Dammers]].<ref name="madness79"/> The song was a surprise hit, peaking in the UK music charts at number 16.<ref name="madness79"/> A performance of "The Prince" on popular UK music show ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' helped Madness gain public recognition. Madness then toured with fellow [[2 Tone]] bands The Specials and [[The Selecter]], before recording their debut album, ''[[One Step Beyond...]]'', which was released by [[Stiff Records]].<ref name="madness79"/> The album included a re-recording of "The Prince" and the band's second and third singles: "[[One Step Beyond (song)|One Step Beyond]]" and "[[My Girl (Madness song)|My Girl]]". The title song was a cover of the [[B-side]] of the 1960s Prince Buster hit "Al Capone". ''One Step Beyond...'' stayed in the [[Great Britain|British]] charts for 37 weeks, peaking at number 2.<ref name="osbchart"> {{cite web|url= http://www.chartstats.com/albuminfo.php?id=4786  |title= One Step Beyond chart information }} Retrieved on [[July 30]], [[2007]].</ref><ref name="madness79"/> After the release of "My Girl", the band felt that they had exhausted the material from ''One Step Beyond...'', and did not want to release any more singles from the album.<ref name="madness80"/> However, Dave Robinson, head of Stiff Records, disagreed.<ref name="madness80"/> Eventually, a compromise was made, and the band decided to release an [[EP]] featuring one album track and three new tracks.<ref name="madness80"/> The result was the ''[[Work Rest and Play]]'' EP, which was headlined by the song "[[Night Boat to Cairo]]", from the ''One Step Beyond'' album.<ref name="madness80"/> The EP reached number 6 in the UK singles chart.<ref name="madness80"/>
 
The following year, the band's second album, ''[[Absolutely (album)|Absolutely]]'' reached number 2 in the UK album charts.<ref name="madness80"> {{cite web|url= http://www.madness.co.uk/time/1980/text.htm  |title= The Madness Timeline: 1980 }} Retrieved on [[June 19]], [[2007]].</ref> ''Absolutely'' spawned some of the band's biggest hits, most notably "[[Baggy Trousers]]", which peaked at number 3 in the UK singles chart.<ref name="madness80"/> "[[Embarrassment (song)|Embarrassment]]" reached number 4 in the charts, and the instrumental song "[[Return of the Los Palmas 7]]" climbed to number 7.<ref name="madness80"/> Although the album reviews were generally less enthusiastic than those of ''One Step Beyond...'', they were mostly positive. [[Robert Christgau]] gave the album a favorable B- grade,<ref name="abrc"> Christgau, Robert. {{cite web|url= http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?id=861&name=Madness  |title= Robert Christgau Madness album reviews }} Retrieved on [[August 1]], [[2007]].</ref> but [[Rolling Stone Magazine]] awarded the album just one out of five stars.<ref name="abrs"> Marcus, Greil. {{cite web|url= http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/madness/albums/album/205337/review/5946271/absolutely  |title= Rolling Stone "Absolutely" review }} Retrieved on [[August 1]], [[2007]].</ref> Rolling Stone was particularly scathing of the [[2 Tone|ska revival]] in general, stating that "''[[Specials (album)|The Specials]]'' wasn't very good" and Madness were simply "the [[Blues Brothers]] with English accents".<ref name="abrs"/>

===1982–1984: Change of direction===
{{sound sample box align left| }}

{{multi-listen item|filename=Madness - Our House.ogg|title="Our House" (1982) |description=The band's most internationally successful single. The song inspired a musical of the same name in 2003, which featured songs from Madness. |format=[[Ogg]]}}
{{multi-listen end}}
{{sample box end}}In 1981, the band's third studio album, ''[[7 (Madness album)|7]]'' reached number 5 in the UK album charts and contained three hit singles.<ref name="madness81"> {{cite web|url= http://www.madness.co.uk/time/1981/text.htm  |title= The Madness Timeline: 1981 }} Retrieved on [[June 19]], [[2007]].</ref> In an article in 1979, [[Chris Foreman]] explained that the band's music would move with the times, and change styles as time goes on.<ref name="soundsmag">{{Citation  | last =Millar  | first =Robbi  | title =  | newspaper =Sounds Magazine | date =September, 1979}} (The full article was also included on the back cover of the ''Absolutely'' LP.)</ref> This was shown to be the case, as unlike the two [[ska]]-filled, fast-paced albums that preceded it, ''7'' was somewhat of a change in direction. [[Graham McPherson|Suggs']] vocal performance changed significantly, and his strong [[Cockney]] accent from the previous albums had been watered down. The album strayed from the ska-influenced sound of ''[[One Step Beyond...]]'' and ''[[Absolutely (album)|Absolutely]]'', and moved towards a more conventional and mature [[Pop music|pop]] sound; a trend that continued with subsequent albums. Near the end of [[1981 in music|1981]], Madness released one of their most recognised songs; a remake of [[Labi Siffre]]'s 1971 hit "[[It Must Be Love]]".<ref name="madness81"/> The song climbed to number 4 in the UK, and in 1983, the song peaked at number 33 in the [[United States|US]]  charts.<ref name="madness81"/><ref name="2tone1"> {{cite web|url= http://2-tone.info/artists/madness.html  |title= 2 Tone Records - Artists }} Retrieved on [[June 19]], [[2007]].</ref> In 1982, Madness released their only number 1 hit to date, "[[House of Fun]]"; as well as their fourth studio album ''[[The Rise & Fall]]''.<ref name="madness82"> {{cite web|url= http://www.madness.co.uk/time/1982/text.htm  |title= The Madness Timeline: 1982 }} Retrieved on [[June 19]], [[2007]].</ref> The album was well received in the UK, but didn't get an American release. Instead, many of the albums songs were included on the US compilation ''[[Madness (album)|Madness]]'', including "[[Our House (Madness song)|Our House]]", which was their most internationally successful single to date. "Our House" reached number 5 in the UK music charts and number 7 in the US charts.<ref name="madness82"/><ref name="madnessstory5"> {{cite web|url= http://www.hilltop61.freeserve.co.uk/2tone/madness5.html  |title= The Madness Story: Chapter 5 }} Retrieved on [[June 19]], [[2007]].</ref> Many reviewers compared the ''The Rise & Fall'' to [[The Kinks]]' ''[[Village Green Preservation Society]]'',<ref name="amriseandfall"> Woodstra, Chris. {{cite web|url= http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&token=&sql=10:gxfwxqw5ldfe  |title= "Allmusic.com The Rise & Fall overview"  }} Retrieved on [[August 2]], [[2007]].</ref> and it is at times retrospectively considered a [[concept album]].

===1985–1988: Decline and breakup===
[[Image:Keep moving.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The ''Keep Moving'' album was Mike Barson's last contribution to the band, until their subsequent reunion.]]In October [[1983 in music|1983]], the band's founder, keyboardist and prominent songwriter [[Mike Barson]] decided to leave the band, partly because he had relocated to [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]].<ref name="madness83"> {{cite web|url= http://www.madness.co.uk/time/1983/text.htm  |title= The Madness Timeline: 1983 }} Retrieved on [[June 5]], [[2007]].</ref>  He officially left the band in June 1984, following the release of "[[One Better Day]]".<ref name="madness84"> {{cite web|url= http://www.madness.co.uk/time/1984/text.htm  |title= The Madness Timeline: 1984 }} Retrieved on [[June 5]], [[2007]], however finished live performance with the band in 1983,  [[Paul Carrack]] took Barson's place whilst the band toured America in early 1984. .</ref> The six remaining members left [[Stiff Records]] and formed their own label, [[Zarjazz Records]], which was sub-label of [[Virgin Records]].<ref name="madness84"/> In 1985, the label released the band's sixth album, ''[[Mad Not Mad]]''. Barson's keyboard parts were filled by [[synthesiser]]s and [[Steve Nieve]] joined the band to take his place.

The band then attempted to record a new album, and 11 demo tracks were recorded.<ref name="storychap6"/> However, musical differences arose between band members, and in September 1986, the band announced that they were to split.<ref name="storychap6"/><ref name="madness86"> {{cite web|url= http://www.madness.co.uk/time/1986/text.htm  |title= The Madness Timeline: 1986 }} Retrieved on [[June 5]], [[2007]].</ref> Barson rejoined the band for a farewell single, "[[(Waiting For) The Ghost Train]]", but did not appear in the [[music video]].<ref name="madness86"/> The band officially split following the release of the single, which reached a high of number 18 in the UK.

While promoting "Sorry", Sway DaSafo confirmed in an interview with ''[[NME]]'' that he will perform in the recording of Madness' updated version of their song "[[Baggy Trousers]]", entitled "Baggy Jeans".<ref name="baggyjeans"> {{cite web|url= http://www.nme.com/news/madness/27212?  |title=  Madness to re-record classic hit with Sway }} Retrieved on [[June 5]], [[2007]].</ref> The updated song will be featured on Madness' upcoming studio album, and also released as a single.<ref name="baggyjeans"/> DaSafo predicted the song will be a "huge smash guaranteed", although the date of release is not yet known.<ref name="baggyjeans"/> However, lead singer Suggs has stated that the album will be released in January 2008, although it has not yet been given an official release date.<ref name="newalbumrelease"> {{cite web|url= http://www.sziget.hu/festival_english/news/100796.html  |title= "An interview with Madness"  }} Retrieved on [[August 15]], [[2007]].</ref>  It was announced in September 2007 that Madness would embark on a seven date U.K. stadium tour including a date at [[The O2]]  in London.  Both the London dates of the tour (The Astoria 3/12/07 and The O2 14/12/07) shall be recorded live for limited distribution.

==Collaborations==

Madness collaborated with [[Elvis Costello]] in 1983 on a version of their song [[Tomorrow's (Just Another Day)]].  It was released as a b-side to the single. In later years [[Mike Barson]] stated that Costello's 'Watching the Detectives' was the main influence on the song [[My Girl]].  For the [[Wonderful]] album in 1999,  [[Ian Dury]] laid down vocals on the track [[Drip Fed Fred]] which was released as the last single from the album.  Subsequently it was Ian's last recording before his death. Live, Madness have collaborated with artists such as [[UB40]] and [[Prince Buster]], notably at their first Madstock concert.

==Lyrical themes==
Although Madness were seen by some as somewhat of a humorous band with catchy, bouncy songs,<ref name="absolutelyam">Woodstra, Chris. {{cite web|url= http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:a9fixqq5ldhe  |title= "Allmusic.com Absolutely overview"  }} Retrieved on [[July 5]], [[2007]].</ref> they sometimes tackled, what were at the time, controversial issues in their lyrics. "[[Embarrassment (song)|Embarrassment]]" (from the ''[[Absolutely (album)|Absolutely]]'' album) was written by [[Lee Jay Thompson|Lee Thompson]], and reflected the unfolding turmoil following the news that his teenage sister had become [[pregnant]] and was carrying a [[Black people|black man's]] child.<ref name="embarrassment">Duffy, Jonathan. {{cite web|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4465666.stm  |title= "An embarrassment no more"  }} Retrieved on [[June 5]], [[2007]].</ref> The band discussed [[animal testing]] in the song "Tomorrow's Dream".<ref name="animaltesting"> Thompson, Lee. {{cite web|url=http://www.madness.co.uk/seven/one_6c.htm  |title= "Tomorrow's Dream": What's it all about? }} Retrieved on [[June 5]], [[2007]].</ref> The band criticized the [[National Health Service]] in "Mrs. Hutchinson", which told the story of a woman who, after several misdiagnoses and mistreatment, became [[Terminal illness|terminally ill]]. The story was based on the experiences of [[Mike Barson|Mike Barson's]] mother.<ref name="mrsh">Barson, Mike. {{cite web|url=http://www.madness.co.uk/seven/one_5c.htm  |title= "Mrs. Hutchinson": What's it all about? }} Retrieved on [[June 5]], [[2007]].</ref> Madness' final single prior to disbanding, "[[(Waiting For) The Ghost Train]]", commented on [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|apartheid]] in [[South Africa]].<ref name="madness86"/>

==Skinhead controversy==
Early in their career, Madness were linked to [[skinhead]]s; members of a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[working class]] [[subculture]] that the media often stereotyped as [[Racism|racist]] (although many skinheads, including the original generation, are [[Anti-racism|anti-racist]]).<ref name="madness79"/><ref name="sharpskins"> {{cite web|url= http://www.skinheadnation.co.uk/sharpskinheads.htm  |title= "SHARP Skinheads" }} Retrieved on [[June 25]], [[2007]].</ref> Not only were Madness, along with other [[2 Tone]] bands, popular with skinheads, but it was said that the band members themselves were associated with the subculture. The band's relationship with the skinheads varied at times.  [[Mike Barson]] was particularly displeased with the band's skinhead association, often finding it disappointing that so many were present at performances. Prior to becoming a full member of the band, [[Chas Smash]] had been involved in fights with skinheads at performances. In one particular incident on [[November 18]], [[1979]], Madness were supported by "Red Beans and Rice", who featured a [[black people|black]] lead singer, and the band were prevented from completing the performance due to the racist chants from certain members of the skinhead filled audience. [[Suggs (singer)|Suggs]] later came on stage to show his displeasure at their behaviour, but this didn't stop much of the audience from [[Nazi salute|Nazi saluting]] at the end of the show.<ref name="madness79"/>

In a 1979 ''[[NME]]'' interview, Madness member Chas Smash was quoted as saying "We don't care if people are in the [[British National Front|NF]] as long as they're having a good time." This added to speculation that Madness was a racist band supporting the National Front, although the band members denied those allegations, and Chas Smash responded to the ''NME'' article in the song "Don't Quote Me On That".<ref name="madness79"/> Eventually, band members denied their skinhead roots, which disappointed much of their skinhead fan base.<ref name="skinheads1"> Pateman, John. {{cite web|url= http://libr.org/isc/occasional_papers/gallery2.html  |title= "This Was England: a Skinhead exhibition from the 1980s" }} Retrieved on [[June 5]], [[2007]].</ref>

==Awards==
The band's first notable musical award came in [[1983]] when they won an "[[Ivor Novello Awards|Ivor Novello Award]]" for ''Best Song'' for the international hit "[[Our House (Madness song)|Our House]]".<ref name="suggsimdb"/><ref name="madness83"/> They received another "Ivor Novello Award" 17 years later for an "Outstanding Song Collection".<ref name="suggsimdb"/><ref name="novellobbc"> {{cite web|url= http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/764027.stm |title= Ivor Novello awards: The winners }} Retrieved on [[June 19]], [[2007]].</ref> In 2005, they were awarded the [[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo Magazine]] "Hall Of Fame" award, notably for being 'an artist's artist'.<ref name="mojoaward"> {{cite web|url= http://promo.emapnetwork.com/mojo/honours2005/
