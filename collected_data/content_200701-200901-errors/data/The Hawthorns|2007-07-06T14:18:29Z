'''The Hawthorns''' is a [[football (soccer)|football]]  [[stadium]] in [[West Bromwich]], [[England]], and is the home of [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.]]. Hosting [[football (soccer)|Association Football]] since [[1900]], the ground was (depending on one's definition) either the first [[The Football League|Football League]] ground to be built in the [[20th century]] or the last built in the [[19th century]]. Notably, at an altitude of 551 [[foot (unit of length)|feet]] (168 metres), it is the [[Highest English football stadia by altitude|highest ground]] among those of all 92 [[Premier League]] and [[The Football League|Football League]] clubs. Today, it is a 28,003 capacity all-seater stadium, making it the [[List of English football stadia by capacity|twenty-eighth largest stadium]] in English football. 

==History==
West Bromwich Albion moved to The Hawthorns after the expiry of their lease on the old ''Stoney Lane'' ground. The name derives from the [[Common Hawthorn|hawthorn]] bushes that were growing on the field when it was chosen for the new ground. The first match at the new venue took place on September 3, 1900, when Albion drew 1-1 with [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]]. Derby's England international [[Steve Bloomer]] scored the first Hawthorns goal, with 'Chippy' Simmons equalizing for Albion.

In its early years, the ground was also used for athletics meetings. In May 1908, [[Birchfield Harriers]] used The Hawthorns for their Spring Meeting, which included the end of the first [[marathon]] to be run in the Midlands. The runners covered 25 miles from [[Coventry]] to the Hawthorns, and one of them - Jack Price of Small Heath Harriers - was selected for the British team for the forthcoming [[1908 Summer Olympics|London Olympic Games]] on the strength of his performance.

Concrete terracing was introduced into the ground in 1920, an electric [[turnstile]] aggregator for automatically calculating attendences in 1949 and the electric [[floodlights]] in 1957. The ground used to be divided by the [[Birmingham]]/[[Smethwick]] border, but was moved completely into the latter by a minor rationalisation of local government borders in the [[1960s]] and is now entirely in [[Sandwell]]. During the mid-late 1990s there were proposals for [[Moseley Rugby Football Club]] to share the ground, but these never materialised.

Large widescreen TV screens were introduced at the start of 2002-03, Albion's first season in the [[Premier League|Premiership]].<ref>{{cite web

|accessdate=2007-07-04}}</ref> In December 2003, the board of directors unveiled plans to increase the stadium's capacity to 40,000 all-seated. However these plans have yet to be materialised, as Albion slipped out of the Premiership in 2006, and are unlikely to go ahead unless Albion ever establish themselves as a Premiership club.

==Stands==
===Halfords Lane Stand/West Stand===
Constructed: [[1979]] - [[1981]]<br>
Capacity: 5,110 (seated)

Running along the west edge of the pitch, the Halfords Lane Stand provided [[Very Important Person (person)|VIP]] seating before the advent of the new East Stand. The stand houses the main TV cameras as well as the press and commentary area. Chairman [[Jeremy Peace]] has announced that there are plans for the Halfords Lane Stand to be demolished to make way for a single-tier, 10,000 seated stand within the next five years. This would raise the total stadium capacity to around 33,000.

===Birmingham Road End===
Constructed: [[1994]] - [[1995]]<br>
Capacity: 6,000 (seated)

Better known to supporters as the ''Brummie Road'', the traditional ''[[Birmingham]] Road End'' runs behind the goal, adjacent to the [[A41 road|A41]]. Traditionally housing the core of the home support, its role has been somewhat stolen by the ''[[Smethwick]] End'' in recent years. Between this stand and the East Stand lies the Woodman corner, named after the Woodman pub which stood just behind it until its demolition in 2004. The Woodman corner is home to a large [[throstle]] mascot, which was originally perched above the old (terraced) Woodman corner, but was housed in the Halfords Lane stand for several seasons until the stadium redevelopments were completed.

===Smethwick End===
Constructed: 1994 - 1995<br>
Capacity: 5,816 (seated)

Running behind the goal at the southern edge of the pitch, the Smethwick End houses the away supporters though they are generally only allocated part of the stand, the remainder housing the most vocal of the home support. (If and when the new west stand is completed there may be a chance of the Smethwick End going to the visitors).

===East Stand===
Constructed: [[2001]]<br>
Capacity: 10,000 (seated)

Replacing the old ''Rainbow Stand'', the East Stand now houses the club's administration offices, club shop, club ticket office and corporate entertainment suites. The wings of the East Stand are known as the Woodman corner (which joins up with the Birmingham Road End, and is named after the Woodman public house that stood there until 2002) and the Millennium Corner (adjacent to the Smethwick End). 

Above the Woodman corner sits a giant effigy of a [[throstle]], which had been a familiar feature of the ground for generations. It used to perch on the old scoreboard in the old (terraced) Woodman Corner; after the redevelopment of the ground in 1994 it was moved temporarily to the main stand in Halfords Lane, and it can now be seen back in its old position.

==Transport==
The stadium is served by [[The Hawthorns station]], which is both a railway station and [[Midland Metro]] (tram) stop. The station is approximately 400 metres from the ground.

Bus routes 74 and 79 pass the stadium along the Birmingham Road, with services running between [[Birmingham]] and [[Dudley]]/[[Wolverhampton]]. The 450 bus stops on Halfords Lane but is rerouted approximately 1 hour before kick off as police close Halfords Lane.
