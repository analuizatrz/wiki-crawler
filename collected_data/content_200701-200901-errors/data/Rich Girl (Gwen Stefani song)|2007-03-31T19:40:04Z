"'''Rich Girl'''" is a [[pop music|pop]]-[[ragga]] song performed by singer [[Gwen Stefani]] featuring [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]].  It was primarily written by [[Dr. Dre]], Eve, and Stefani with other collaborators for Stefani's debut solo album ''[[Love. Angel. Music. Baby.|Love. Angel. Music. Baby]]'' (2004). The song is based on the Louchie Lou and Michie One 1993 song of the same name, which is an adaptation of the ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'' song "[[If I Were a Rich Man (song)|If I Were a Rich Man]]".

The track was released as the album's second [[single (music)|single]] in 2005 (see [[2005 in music]]) to mixed reviews from music critics.  It was a worldwide commercial success, reaching number two in [[Australia]] and the top twenty on the majority of the [[record chart|chart]]s it entered.  At the [[48th Grammy Awards]], the song was nominated for [[Best Rap/Sung Collaboration]].

==Writing process==
When Stefani first began recording solo material, Eve showed interest in working with Stefani again, having previously worked with her on "[[Let Me Blow Ya Mind]]", and commented, "She's fly, she's tight and she is talented. It's going to be hot regardless."<ref>Moss, Corey and Downey, Ryan J.  [http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1471367/20030418/no_doubt.jhtml "Gwen Stefani Recording Solo Material"].  [[MTV News]].

[[MTV News]].  [[January 31]], [[2005]].

After playing some of the songs on which she had been working, Dr. Dre told her, "You don't want to go back there."<ref name="scared"/>  Instead of using one of the tracks, Dr. Dre instead suggested using the Louchie Lou and Michie One 1993 song "Rich Girl", which itself interpolated "[[If I Were a Rich Man (song)|If I Were a Rich Man]]" from the 1964 musical ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]''.<ref name="scared"/>  Stefani and Eve helped each other with their parts, but when they presented Dr. Dre with the track, he told them to rewrite the song again.<ref name="scared"/>  The idea which became the final version came to Stefani while [[brainstorming]] on her [[treadmill]].<ref name="scared"/>  She commented that the troubles in writing the song came because "Dre was really pushing me to write in a new way" but when she presented him with the song, "he just totally tricked the track out".<ref>[http://www.rebelwaltz.com/gwen_stefani.html "Gwen Stefani"].

==Critical reception==
"Rich Girl" received mixed reviews from music critics.  [[PlayLouder]] said that it brought "a much-needed element of diversity" to ''L.A.M.B.'' and called it a "potential hit single".<ref>Smirke, Richard.

The interpolation of "If I Were a Rich Man" also drew mixed reviews.  [[PopMatters]] argued that the track "turns it into an anthem of urban [[bling]]-lust" and that its "simple pounding piano [[chord (music)|chord]] makes for great [[percussive]] backing".<ref name="pm"/>  ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' disagreed, stating that the interpolation was used awkwardly,<ref>Browne, David.

The [[music video]] for "Rich Girl" was [[music video director|directed]] by [[David LaChapelle]] and features a [[pirate]] theme.  The video opens with four [[Japan]]ese [[schoolgirl]]s playing with a pirate ship and [[Bratz]] dolls, discussing what they would do if they were a "rich girl". The video features several sequences.  Stefani is first shown on board the pirate ship bellow deck, dancing on a table, singing to the song.  She is surrounded by other "pirates" and is soon joined by Eve, wearing an [[eyepatch]].  Above deck Stefani and her dancers, also dressed as pirates, dance.  Stefani is also seen swinging from an [[anchor]] and dancing with the [[Harajuku Girls]] in a [[treasure trove]].  The video concludes with the four schoolgirls dropping the pirate ship in a [[fish tank]], causing Stefani and her fellow pirates to fall all over the ship.
