'''Nine Inch Nails''' (abbreviated as '''NI<!--Please do not use И; it is the Cyrillic letter I -->N''') is an [[United States|American]] [[rock band]] founded in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[Ohio]] circa [[1988 in music|1988]] by [[Trent Reznor]]. As its main [[Producer (music)|producer]], singer, songwriter, and [[instrumentalist]], Reznor is the only official member of Nine Inch Nails and remains solely responsible for its musical direction.<ref name = "AMG" /> NIN's music straddles a wide range of genres and techniques while retaining a characteristically intense sound. After recording a new album, Reznor usually assembles [[Nine Inch Nails live performances|a live band]] to perform with him; this live component is a separate entity from Nine Inch Nails in the [[recording studio]].<ref name="Industrial Introspection" /><ref name="Wigney" /> On stage, NIN often employs spectacular visual elements to accompany its performances, which frequently culminate with the band destroying musical instruments.<ref name="Reimink" />

[[Underground music]] audiences warmly received Nine Inch Nails in its early years. The band would produce several highly influential records in the 1990s that achieved widespread popularity and won two [[Grammy Awards]]. Many Nine Inch Nails songs became radio hits,<ref name = "BillboardHistory" /> and the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] has certified the sale of over 10.5 million units of the band's albums in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=3&table=tblTopArt&action=|title= Best Sellers: Gold & Platinum Top Artists |publisher= [[Recording Industry Association of America]] |date= [[2006-07-31]] |accessdate= 2007-02-05}}</ref> In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' placed Nine Inch Nails at 94 on their list of the 100 greatest music artists of all time.<ref>{{cite journal |title= Nine Inch Nails |last= Bowie |first= David |authorlink=David Bowie |journal= [[Rolling Stone]] |issue=972 |date=[[2005-04-21]] |url = http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/7250012/94_nine_inch_nails |accessdate=2007-03-13}}</ref> Despite this acclaim, the band has had several feuds with corporate aspects of the recording industry.

In the past, NI<!--Please do not use И -->N released major studio albums infrequently; [[remix]]es and [[live album]]s bridged these gaps in the band's catalog. Reznor cites his personal issues as the cause of these delays, and his songs often confront dark explorations of the self.<ref name="SMH">{{cite web |url= http://www.smh.com.au/news/music/hammer-time-over/2005/08/04/1122748732635.html |title= Hammer time over |author= Roberts, Jo |publisher= [[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date= [[2005-08-05]] |accessdate= 2006-11-28}}</ref> The most recent Nine Inch Nails album, ''[[Year Zero (album)|Year Zero]]'', is an exception to both the typically introspective nature of Reznor's songwriting and its long gestation period.

==History==
===Early years===
Initial ambitions for Nine Inch Nails were modest: in 1988, Reznor hoped to release one [[12-inch single]] on a small European label.<ref name= "AP90">{{cite journal |url= http://theninhotline.net/archives/articles/getdowninit.shtml |title= Getting Down in It |date= March 1990 |journal= [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]] |issue= 27 |accessdate= 2006-10-30}}  Archived at [http://www.theninhotline.net The NIN Hotline].</ref> He was employed at that time as an assistant engineer and janitor at [[Midtown Recording|Right Track Studios]] in Cleveland,<ref name="AMG">{{cite web |author= Huey, Steve |url= http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:jxkcikv6bbf9~T10 |title= Nine Inch Nails |accessdate= 2006-11-24 |publisher= [[All Music Guide]]}}</ref> and asked studio owner Bart Koster for permission to record some [[Demo (music)|demos]] of his own songs for free during unused studio time. Koster agreed, remarking that it cost him "just a little wear on [his] tape heads."<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://nothing.nin.net/int12.html |title= The music of rage |journal= [[People (magazine)|People]] |volume=43 |issue=5 |last=Dougherty |first= Steve |coauthors=Bryan Alexander, Tom Nugent, John Hannah |date= [[1995-02-06]] |pages=105–107 |accessdate= 2006-11-29}}  Archived at [http://www.nin.net nin.net].</ref> While assembling these, the earliest NIN recordings, Reznor was unable to find a band that could articulate his songs as he wanted. Instead, inspired by [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], Reznor played all the instruments except drums himself.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.theninhotline.net/archives/articles/xart27a.shtml |title= The Truth About Trent |journal=Option |last=Fine |first=Jason |date=July/August 1994 |accessdate= 2007-08-24}} Archived at [http://www.theninhotline.net The NIN Hotline].</ref> On most of the band's studio recordings, this role remains Reznor's, though he has occasionally involved other musicians and assistants. Several labels responded favorably to the demo material, and Reznor signed with [[TVT Records]].<ref name= "AMG" /> Nine selections from the Right Track demos were unofficially released in 1994 as ''[[Purest Feeling]]''; many of these songs would appear in revised form on ''[[Pretty Hate Machine]]'' in 1989.

Several rumors have persisted about the origins of the name "Nine Inch Nails," one being that Reznor chose to reference the story of Jesus' crucifixion with nine inch spikes.<ref name = "Shock">{{cite book |first= Greg |last= Rule |title= Electro Shock!: Groundbreakers of Synth Music |publisher= Backbeat Books |year= 1999 |id= ISBN 0-8793-0582-7}}</ref> [[Chuck Klosterman]] surmised that Reznor was inspired by the sight of nine inch fingernails on [[Freddy Krueger]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.spin.com/features/magazine/columns/chuck_klosterman/2006/03/0603_chuck/ |title= Arriving late to the Nine Inch Nails party |last= Klosterman |first= Chuck |authorlink= Chuck Klosterman |publisher = [[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |date= March 1992 |accessdate = 2006-11-01}}</ref> Reznor maintains that he coined the name because it "abbreviated easily," rather than for "any literal meaning."<ref name = "Axcess">{{cite journal |url= http://theninhotline.net/archives/articles/axc94a.shtml | title = Talking about Nothing with Trent Reznor |journal= Axcess |volume = 2 |date= 1994 |accessdate= 2006-10-22}}  Archived at [http://www.theninhotline.net The NIN Hotline].</ref> Reznor and Gary Talpas designed the Nine Inch Nails logo, which consists of the letters "NIN" set inside a border with the second "N" reversed. The logo first appeared on NIN's debut, "[[Down in It]]," and was inspired by [[Tibor Kalman]]'s typography on the [[Talking Heads]] album ''[[Remain in Light]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nin.com/access/7_21_04/questions5.gif |title= Response from Trent |date= [[2004-07-21]] |last= Reznor |first=Trent |authorlink = Trent Reznor |publisher= [http://nin.com The official NIN website] |accessdate= 2006-10-22}}</ref> Talpas, a native of Cleveland, would continue to design NIN packaging art through the 1997 double [[VHS]] ''[[Closure (Nine Inch Nails VHS)|Closure]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=

===''Pretty Hate Machine''===
{{main|Pretty Hate Machine}}
[[Image:Nin-pretty hate machine.jpg|thumb|right|150px|''[[Pretty Hate Machine]]''<br />(1989)]]
Written, arranged, and performed by Trent Reznor, NIN's first album '''''Pretty Hate Machine''''' debuted in 1989. The album marked Reznor's first collaboration with [[Adrian Sherwood]] (who produced lead single "Down in It" in [[London, England]] without having met Reznor face-to-face)<ref name = "AP90" /> and [[Flood (producer)|Mark "Flood" Ellis]]. Flood's production would appear on each major Nine Inch Nails release until 1994, and Sherwood has done remixes for the band as recently as 2000. Reznor and his co-producers expanded upon the ''Purest Feeling'' demos, and added future singles "[[Head Like a Hole]]" and "[[Sin (Nine Inch Nails song)|Sin]]".

''[[Rolling Stone]]'''s [[Michael Azerrad]] described the album as "industrial-strength noise over a pop framework" and "harrowing but catchy music";<ref name="RS Azerrad">{{cite journal | last = Azerrad | first = Michael | authorlink = Michael Azerrad | title = Nine Inch Nails | journal = [[Rolling Stone]] | issue = 1990 | date = 1990 | url = http://theninhotline.net/archives/articles/xart12.shtml | accessdate = 2007-08-27}}  Archived at [http://www.theninhotline.net The NIN Hotline]</ref>  Reznor proclaimed this combination "a sincere statement" of "what was in [his] head at the time."<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://theninhotline.net/archives/articles/thrash.shtml |author= Martin, Steve |title= Nine Inch Nails |journal= [[Thrasher (magazine)|Thrasher]] |date= 1990 |accessdate= 2006-10-30}}  Archived at [http://www.theninhotline.net The NIN Hotline].</ref> Spending two years on the album charts, ''Pretty Hate Machine'' became one of the first [[Indie (music)|independently released]] records to attain [[RIAA certification|platinum certification]].<ref name="AMG" /> [[MTV]] aired videos for "Down in It" and "Head Like a Hole," but an explicit video for "Sin" was only released on the 1997 home video ''Closure'', albeit in edited form. In the album's liner notes, Reznor thanks [[horror fiction]] writer [[Clive Barker]] for inspiration.

The live band first toured North America opening for industrial act [[Skinny Puppy]] and later for [[alternative rock]] artists such as [[Peter Murphy (musician)|Peter Murphy]] and [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]].<ref name="AMG" /> On these tours, Reznor quickly gained a reputation for smashing equipment on stage out of frustration, and an interview with ''Rockbeat'' attributed NIN's eventual success in front of rock orientated audiences to this extremely aggressive attitude.<ref name = "Rockbeat">{{cite journal |url= http://theninhotline.net/archives/articles/xart198.shtml |title= The man behind the machine |author= Gitter, Mike |journal= Rockbeat |date= 1992 |accessdate= 2006-12-06}} Archived at [http://www.theninhotline.net The NIN Hotline].</ref> Nine Inch Nails then embarked on a world tour that continued through the first [[Lollapalooza]] festival in 1991, where the band "stole the show" from headliners [[Jane's Addiction]] despite numerous equipment problems.<ref name = "Huxley">{{cite book |last= Huxley |first= Martin |title= Nine Inch Nails: Self Destruct |year= 1997 |month= September |publisher= St. Martin's Griffin |id= ISBN 0-3121-5612-X}}</ref> After a disastrous European reception opening for [[Guns N' Roses]], NIN returned to America amid pressure from TVT to produce a more commercial follow-up to ''Pretty Hate Machine''. In response, Reznor secretly began recording under various pseudonyms to avoid record company interference.<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://theninhotline.net/archives/articles/musica.shtml |title= Nine Inch Nails |journal= [[Musician (magazine)|Musician]] |date= March 1994 |accessdate= 2006-12-02}}  Archived at [http://www.theninhotline.net The NIN Hotline].</ref>

===''Broken''===
{{main|Broken (Nine Inch Nails EP)}}
[[Image:Nin-broken.jpg|thumb|right|150px|''[[Broken (Nine Inch Nails EP)|Broken]]''<br />(1992)]]
The fruit of Reznor's disillusionment with his record label and culmination of the band's harsh, aggressive live sound, the '''''Broken''''' [[Extended Play|EP]] of six songs and two bonus tracks was released in 1992. In the liner notes, Reznor credits his band from the 1991 tour as an influence on ''Broken'', which he described as a guitar-based "blast of destruction."<ref name="Shock" />

[[Peter Christopherson|Peter "Sleazy" Christopherson]] of the bands [[Coil (band)|Coil]] and [[Throbbing Gristle]] directed a performance video for "Wish",<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.9inchnails.com/gallery/wish.php |title= Wish |publisher= Painful Convictions |date= 2007 |accessdate=2007-08-07}}</ref> but the EP's most infamous video accompanied the song "[[Happiness in Slavery]]". The video was almost universally [[censorship|banned]] for its graphic depiction of [[performance art]]ist [[Bob Flanagan]] disrobing in front of the camera and lying on a machine that pleasures, tortures, then kills him.<ref name="Stone94">{{cite journal |title= Love it to death |last=Gold |first=Jonathan |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |issue= 690 |pages= 50 |date=[[September 8]], [[1994]]}}</ref> A third video for "Pinion", partially incorporated into MTV's ''Alternative Nation'' opening sequence, showed a toilet that apparently flushes into the mouth of an individual in bondage.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.9inchnails.com/gallery/pinion.php |title= Pinion |publisher= Painful Convictions |date= 2007 |accessdate=2007-08-07}}</ref> Reznor and Christopherson compiled these three clips into a longform music video also called ''[[Broken (film)|Broken]]'', which depicts the murder of a young man who is kidnapped and tortured while forced to watch the videos. This footage was never officially released, but instead appeared covertly among tape trading circles.<ref name="Stone94" />

A separate performance video for "Gave Up" featuring [[Richard Patrick]] and [[Marilyn Manson (person)|Marilyn Manson]] was filmed at [[10050 Cielo Drive|Le Pig studios]], site of the [[Charles Manson]] murders. A live recording of "Wish" was also filmed, and both videos appeared on the ''Closure'' compilation in 1997.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.9inchnails.com/gallery/gave-up.php |title= Gave Up |publisher= Painful Convictions |date= 2007 |accessdate=2007-08-07}}</ref> ''Broken'' was followed by the remix EP ''[[Fixed (EP)|Fixed]]'' in late 1992. Rather than tour in support of the new material, Reznor began living and recording full-time at Le Pig, working on a follow-up free of restrictions from his record label.

The album spawned two singles: "[[March of the Pigs]]" and "[[Closer to God|Closer]]"; "[[Hurt (song)|Hurt]]" and "Piggy" were issued to radio without a commercial single release. The music video for "Closer", directed by [[Mark Romanek]], received frequent rotation on MTV after the network made edits to it.<ref name="Closer video">{{cite web |title= Nine Inch Nails: Closure (VHS) |publisher= DeepFocus.com |url= http://www.deep-focus.com/flicker/closure.html |accessdate= 2007-08-26}}</ref>  A radio edit that partially mutes the song's explicit lyrics also received extensive airtime.<ref name= "BillboardHistory" /> "Hurt" enjoyed renewed success when it was [[Cover version|covered]] by [[Johnny Cash]] in 2002, and Reznor has stated that hearing Cash's cover revitalized his interest in writing music.<ref>{{cite book |last= DeCurtis |first= Anthony |authorlink= Anthony DeCurtis |title= In Other Words |chapter= Trent Reznor on 'Hurt' |publisher= Hal Leonard |origyear= 2005 |id= ISBN 0-6340-6655-2}}</ref> [[David Bowie]] also sang "Hurt" alongside Reznor during the two artists' co-headlining 1995 tour. The ''Closure'' video documents this and other highlights from NIN's marathon ''Self Destruct'' tour, including full live videos of "Eraser", "Hurt" and the [[Long take|one-take]] "March of the Pigs" clip made for MTV. This tour reached its widest mainstream audience with a mud-drenched performance at [[Woodstock '94]] that was broadcast on [[Pay-Per-View]] and seen in as many as 24 million homes.<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-16319994.html |title= Feedback muddy from Woodstock PPV |author= Umstead, R.

After ''The Downward Spiral'', Reznor produced a remix album entitled ''[[Further Down the Spiral]]'', the only non-major NIN release to be certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] in the United States.<ref name="RIAA.com" /> It featured contributions from electronic musician [[Aphex Twin]], producer [[Rick Rubin]], and former [[Jane's Addiction]] guitarist [[Dave Navarro]]. Two versions of ''Further Down the Spiral'' were released in 1995, both featuring exclusive content. A 10th anniversary deluxe reissue of ''The Downward Spiral'' was released on [[November 23]], [[2004]], which prompted ''Rolling Stone'' to describe the album as a "masterpiece".<ref>{{cite web |title= DualDisc format takes off |url= http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/davidbowie/articles/story/7207720/dualdisc_format_takes_off |publisher = [[Rolling Stone]].com |first= Brian |last= Hiatt |date= [[2005-03-25]] |accessdate= 2007-08-26}}</ref>

''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' hailed ''The Fragile'' as "album of the year", and several songs from it were regular features on [[alternative rock]] radio stations.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://theninhotline.net/archives/articles/xart150.shtml |title= Rock radio pumps up volume |author = Kaufman, Gil |work = SonicNet News |date=[[1999-12-02]] |accessdate= 2006-10-28}}  Archived at [http://www.theninhotline.net The NIN Hotline].</ref> According to Reznor, the album was built around "sound-scapes" in which "songwriting and arranging and production and sound design[...] became the same thing.

Prior to the album's release, the song "[[Starfuckers, Inc.]]" provoked media speculation about whom Reznor had intended its acerbic lyrics to satirize.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://theninhotline.net/archives/articles/xart79.shtml |title= Provocative, pounding new NIN songs leaked to radio |author = Kaufman, Gil |work = SonicNet News |date= [[1999-07-14]] |accessdate= 2006-10-28}}  Archived at [http://www.theninhotline.net The NIN Hotline].</ref> [[Cinesexuality]] critic Patricia MacCormack interprets the song as a "scathing attack on the alternative music scene", particularly Reznor's former friend and protégé [[Marilyn Manson (person)|Marilyn Manson]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.popmatters.com/music/videos/n/nin-starfuckers.shtml |title=All the fun of the (not so) fair |last= MacCormack |first= Patricia |publisher=[[PopMatters]] |accessdate= 2007-08-26}}</ref> The two artists put aside their differences when Manson co-directed and appeared in the song's music video, retitled "Starsuckers, Inc." and performed on stage with NIN at [[Madison Square Garden]] in 2000. Nine Inch Nails released three commercial singles from the album in different territories: "[[The Day the World Went Away]]" in North America; "[[We're in This Together]]" in the [[EU]] and Japan (on three separate discs); and an EP with "[[Into the Void (Nine Inch Nails song)|Into the Void]]" as its lead track in [[Australia]]. MTV aired videos for the latter two tracks, as well as "Starsuckers, Inc."

Reznor followed ''The Fragile'' with another remix album, ''[[Things Falling Apart]]''. This was released soon after the 2000 ''Fragility'' tour, which itself was recorded and released on CD, [[DVD]], and VHS in 2002 as ''[[And All that Could Have Been]]''. A deluxe edition of the live CD came with the companion disc ''[[Still (Nine Inch Nails album)|Still]]'', featuring stripped-down re-interpretations of songs from the band's entire career along with several new pieces of music.

Nine Inch Nails' fourth full-length album, '''''With Teeth''''', was released in 2005, though it [[Internet leak|leaked]] prior to its official release date.

A promotional video for the song "[[The Hand That Feeds]]" premiered on NIN's website in March 2005, rather than the traditional music channels, and Trent Reznor released the source files for "The Hand that Feeds" in [[GarageBand]] format a month later, allowing fans to remix the song.<ref name= "March05">{{cite web |url= http://www.nin.com/current/ |publisher= Nine Inch Nails |title= Current |date= [[2005-04-15]] |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20050420075258/nin.com/current/ |archivedate= 2005-04-20 |accessdate= 2007-08-26}}</ref> This release spawned an unofficial remix contest, in which over 500 fan remixes were submitted.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ninremixes.com/about.php |title= NINRemixes.com History |accessdate= 2007-05-08}}</ref> In response to this successful experiment, Reznor also released the source files for the album's second single "[[Only (Nine Inch Nails song)|Only]]" in a wider range of formats, including [[ProTools]] and [[ACID Pro]]; fans were also invited to access the band's official MySpace page to upload remixes, vote for favorites, and comment about them in a [[blog]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.myspace.com/ninremixes |title= NIN remixes |publisher= [[MySpace]] |accessdate= 2006-12-24}}</ref> [[David Fincher]] directed a video for "Only" using primarily [[computer-generated imagery]].

Most of these are labeled with [[Nine Inch Nails discography#Halo numbers|''halos'']], a sequential numbering system that applies to most official NIN releases.

Nine Inch Nails has also recorded five songs specifically for film soundtracks: in 1994, [[Joy Division]]'s "Dead Souls" for ''[[The Crow (album)|The Crow]]'', "[[Burn (Nine Inch Nails song)|Burn]]" and a reworked version of "Something I Can Never Have" for ''[[Natural Born Killers (soundtrack)|Natural Born Killers]]''; "[["The Perfect Drug" Versions|The Perfect Drug]]" for 1997's ''[[Lost Highway (soundtrack)|Lost Highway]]''; and in 2001, "[[Deep (song)|Deep]]" for ''[[Lara Croft: Tomb Raider]]''.<ref name="RS discography">{{cite web |title= Nine Inch Nails - Discography |publisher= [[Rolling Stone]] |url= http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/nineinchnails/discography | accessdate = 2007-08-21}}</ref> Other film music, such as "You Know What You Are?" from [[Clint Mansell]]'s ''[[Doom (film)|Doom]]'' soundtrack, constitutes remixes of NIN's official catalog by other artists.<ref name="Doom soundtrack">{{cite web |title= Doom Soundtrack |publisher= Soundtrack.net |url= http://www.soundtrack.net/albums/database/?id=3924 |accessdate= 2007-08-21}}</ref> Reznor himself has remixed a number of songs by other artists, only a few of which are [[Nine Inch Nails discography#Remixes|credited to NIN]].

{{Inline audio|section}}
[[Image:NineInchNails.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Nine Inch Nails live on tour in 2005]]
The [[All Music Guide]] categorizes Nine Inch Nails in various styles overlapping with the [[industrial rock]] genre, including [[alternative rock]], [[alternative metal]], [[industrial metal]] and [[dance-rock]].<ref name="AMG" /> Reznor has never referred to his own work as [[industrial music]], but admits to borrowing techniques from such bands as [[Throbbing Gristle]] and [[Test Dept.]]<ref name="Axcess" /> Despite the disparity between those artists initially operating under the term "industrial" and Nine Inch Nails, it has become common in journalistic descriptions of Reznor's body of work to describe it as such. In actuality, the band's output has covered a wide range of genres: though Reznor acknowledged in ''Spin'' magazine that "Down in It" was influenced by early [[Skinny Puppy]], particularly their song "[[Dig It (single)|Dig It]]", other songs from ''Pretty Hate Machine'' were described in the same interview as [[synth-pop]].<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://www.theninhotline.net/archives/articles/xint8a.shtml |title= Sympathy for the devil |journal= [[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |date= March 1996 |accessdate= 2006-10-22}} Archived at [http://www.theninhotline.net The NIN Hotline]</ref> By contrast, songs such as "The Perfect Drug" and "Starfuckers, Inc." contain elements of [[drum and bass]] dance music, whereas "The Frail" creates a melancholy mood with solo piano instrumentation.<ref>{{cite web |title= NIN's new effort threads the line between beauty and destruction |first= Steve |last= Cooper |publisher= The Cavalier Daily |url= http://www.cavalierdaily.com/CVArticle.asp?ID=768&pid=469 |date= [[1999-09-24]] |accessdate= 2007-08-26}}</ref>

Certain techniques and styles can be found throughout NIN's back catalog. Extreme [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]] are staples of songs like "Wish" ({{audio-nohelp|Wish.ogg|sample}}) and "The Day the World Went Away" ({{audio-nohelp|TDtWWA.ogg|sample}}), which quickly change from quiet to loud and back again, ending with a loud climax followed by an abrupt stop, rather than by fading out or letting the final note resonate. Reznor's singing follows a similar pattern, frequently moving from whispers to screams. The band's music also occasionally features odd [[time signatures]], notably in "The Collector"<ref name = "PopMatters review">{{cite web |url= http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/n/nineinchnails-withteeth.shtml |title= "Nine Inch Nails: With Teeth" |publisher= [http://www.popmatters.com PopMatters] |author= Schiller, Mike |date= [[2005-05-18]] |accessdate= 2006-12-20}}</ref> and "March of the Pigs".<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20050405/ai_n13498487 |title= Arts reviews: Nine Inch Nails |work= [[The Independent]] |date=[[2005-04-05]] |author= Nash, Rob |accessdate= 2006-12-20}}  Archived at [http://www.findarticles.com FindArticles.com].</ref> Reznor also favors the use of [[Noise (audio)|noise]] and distortion in his song arrangements, and often incorporates [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] with [[chromatic]] melody and/or harmony. A well-known example of this technique is in the song "Hurt" ({{audio-nohelp|Hurt.ogg|sample}}), which features a highly dissonant [[tritone]] played on guitar during the verses, a B5#11, emphasized when Reznor sings the [[eleventh]] note on the word "I" every time the B/F [[Dyad (music)|dyad]] is played.<ref>{{cite book |author= Reynolds, Tom |title= I Hate Myself and I Want to Die |pages= 227 |id= ISBN 978-1860746284 |date= [[2005-06-13]] |publisher= Sanctuary Publishing}}</ref> "Closer" ({{audio-nohelp|Closer.ogg|sample}}), from the same album, concludes with a chromatic piano [[Motif (music)|motif]]: the same melody that recurs on the title track of ''The Downward Spiral''.<ref name = "PopMatters review" /> On ''The Fragile'', Reznor revisits this technique of repeating a motif multiple times throughout different songs, either on a different musical instrument, with a transposed harmony, or in an altered tempo.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://theninhotline.net/archives/articles/xrevw136.shtml |title= The Fragile |publisher= Lollipop Online |date= May 2000 |author= Marburger, Lex |accessdate= 2006-12-20}}  Archived at [http://www.theninhotline.net The NIN Hotline].</ref>

{{main|Nine Inch Nails live performances}}
It is generally understood that the Nine Inch Nails live band is a separate entity from the recording studio-based component of NIN.<ref name="Industrial Introspection">{{cite web | url = http://gopher.well.sf.ca.us:70/0/Publications/authors/Gareth_Branwyn/gar4.cv | title = Industrial Introspection | last = Branwyn | first = Gareth | authorlink = Gareth Branwyn | publisher = ''[[Mondo 2000]]'' #5 | date = [[1991-06-19]] | accessdate = 2007-02-10}}  Archived at [[WELL]].</ref><ref name="Wigney">{{cite web | url = http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/N/Nine_Inch_Nails/2006/03/03/1471299-sun.html | title = NIN keyboardist having a blast | author = Allan Wigney | publisher = ''[[Ottawa Sun]]'' | date = [[2006-03-03]] | accessdate = 2007-02-10}} Archived at [[Canadian Online Explorer]].</ref> Occasionally, past band members are invited to participate in the process, but when not directly involved with recording new material, Nine Inch Nails' lineup tends to change drastically between major tours. Aside from Trent Reznor remaining on lead vocals and guitar, nothing about the live band has remained constant since its inception.

==Corporate entanglements==

Trent Reznor is an outspoken critic of the music industry, particularly corporate influence on his artistic freedom. As a result, Nine Inch Nails has clashed with several corporations.

===TVT Records and Nothing Records===

In the early 1990s, Nine Inch Nails was involved in a much-publicized feud with TVT Records, the first record label to sign the band. Reznor objected to the label's attempted interference with his intellectual property.<ref name = "Shock" /> Ultimately, they entered into a joint venture with Interscope Records in which Reznor forfeited a portion of his [[Music publisher (popular music)|publishing rights]] to TVT Music in exchange for the freedom of having his own [[Nothing Records]] imprint.<ref name = "Huxley" /> In 2005, Reznor sued his former friend and manager [[John Malm, Jr.]], co-founder of Nothing, for [[breach of contract]] and breach of [[Fiduciary|fiduciary duty]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://theninhotline.net/archives/articles/manager/display_article.php?id=102 |title= NIN's Reznor: I was duped by manager |date= [[2005-05-17]] |publisher= [[Associated Press]] |accessdate= 2006-11-29}}  Archived at [http://www.theninhotline.net The NIN Hotline].</ref> Their relationship was formally severed in a New York courtroom, with damages awarded to Reznor in excess of three million US dollars.<ref name = "E! Online">{{cite web | url = http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=0d53d346-74a1-496c-a624-3ce5e8054ae4 |title= Reznor bails on MTV, nails manager |author= Amter, Charlie |publisher= [[E! Online]] |date= [[2005-05-27]] |accessdate= 2006-11-28}}</ref>

At the behest of [[Prudential Financial|Prudential Securities]] bankruptcy proceedings, TVT put the rights to Reznor's recordings for the label on auction in 2005. This offer included all of the label's catalog, including ''Pretty Hate Machine'' and a percentage of royalties from Reznor's song publishing company, Leaving Hope Music/TVT Music. [[Rykodisc]], who did not win the auction but were able to license the rights from Prudential, re-issued the out-of-print ''Pretty Hate Machine'' CD on [[November 22]], [[2005]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://theninhotline.net/news/archives/backissue/05/10#1130439320 |title= Rykodisk to reissue pretty hate machine *updated* |publisher=The NIN Hotline |date= [[2005-10-27]] |accessdate= 2006-11-28}}</ref> Ryko also reissued the "Head Like a Hole" CD and a vinyl edition of ''Pretty Hate Machine'' on [[January 31]], [[2006]]. They considered releasing a deluxe edition, just as Interscope had done for ''The Downward Spiral''; however, Reznor declined to produce it for them without payment.<ref name = "Toronto Sun">{{cite news |url= http://www.torontosun.com/Entertainment/Music/2005/11/08/1297497-sun.html |title= Reznor grits his teeth |author= Ladouceur, Liisa |work= [[The Toronto Sun]] |date= [[2005-11-08]] |accessdate= 2006-10-22}}</ref>

===2005 MTV Movie Awards===

Nine Inch Nails was scheduled to perform at the 2005 [[MTV Movie Awards]], but dropped themselves from the show due to a disagreement with the network over the use of an unaltered image of [[George W. Bush]] as a backdrop to the band's performance of "[[The Hand that Feeds]]."<ref name = "E! Online" /><ref name="MTV Awards">{{cite web

Soon afterwards, Reznor wrote on the official NIN website: "apparently, the image of our president is as offensive to MTV as it is to me."<ref name = "E! Online" /><ref name="MTV Awards" /> MTV replied that they respected Reznor's point of view, but were "uncomfortable" with the performance being "built around partisan political statements." A performance by the [[Foo Fighters]] replaced NIN's time slot on the show.<ref name = "E! Online" /><ref name="MTV Awards" />

===Fox News===

On [[October 24]], [[2006]], after being alerted by a fan website, Reznor issued a [[cease and desist]] to [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] for using three songs from ''The Fragile'' on air without permission. The songs "La Mer," "The Great Below," and "The Mark Has Been Made" appeared in an episode of ''[[War Stories with Oliver North]]'' detailing the [[battle of Iwo Jima]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://theninhotline.net/news/archives/backissue/06/10#1161617908 |title= Fox News, War Stories, and Nine Inch Nails |publisher=The NIN Hotline |date= [[2006-10-23]] |accessdate= 2006-11-29}}</ref> A post appeared on Reznor's blog, which read: "Thanks for the Fox News heads-up.

===Recording Industry Association of America===

As part of the [[Year Zero (alternate reality game)|alternate reality game]] which accompanied the release of ''[[Year Zero (album)|Year Zero]]'', three tracks from the album were intentionally "leaked" prior to the album's release at a number of NIN concerts on [[USB flash drive|USB drives]].<ref name="CoolerThanLost" />  The high-quality, pre-release audio quickly circulated the internet. Owners of websites hosting the files soon received cease and desist orders from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], despite the fact that the viral campaign, and the use of USB drives, was sanctioned by Nine Inch Nails' record label.<ref name="BillboardPaolette">{{cite web | last = Paoletta | first = Michael | title = Online Odyssey Stoking Interest In New NIN Album  | publisher = ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' | date = [[2007-03-30]] | url = http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003565585 | accessdate = 2007-05-20}}</ref>  The source that broke the story was quoted as saying "These fucking idiots are going after a campaign that the label signed off on."<ref name="BillboardPaolette" />

===Universal Music Group===

On [[May 13]], [[2007]] Reznor made a post on his blog on the official Nine Inch Nails website condemning [[Universal Music Group]] for their pricing and distribution plans for ''Year Zero''.<ref name="RollingStoneKreps">{{cite web | last = Kreps | first = Daniel | title = Nine Inch Nails’ Trent Reznor Slams Records Labels for Sorry State of the Industry | publisher = [[Rolling Stone]] | date = [[2007-05-14]] | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/05/14/nine-inch-nails-trent-reznor-slams-records-labels-for-sorry-state-of-the-industry/ | accessdate = 2007-05-19}}</ref>  The full text of that post is as follows:

{{cquotetxt|As the climate grows more and more desperate for record labels, their answer to their mostly self-inflicted wounds seems to be to screw the consumer over even more. A couple of examples that quickly come to mind:

<nowiki>*</nowiki> The ABSURD retail pricing of Year Zero in Australia. Shame on you, UMG. Year Zero is selling for $34.99 Australian dollars ($29.10 US). No wonder people steal music. [[Avril Lavigne]]'s [[The Best Damn Thing|record]] in the same store was $21.99 ($18.21 US).
By the way, when I asked a label rep about this his response was: "It's because we know you have a real core audience that will pay whatever it costs when you put something out - you know, true fans. It's the pop stuff we have to discount to get people to buy."
So... I guess as a reward for being a "true fan" you get ripped off.

<nowiki>*</nowiki> The dreaded EURO Maxi-single. Nothing but a consumer rip-off that I've been talked into my whole career. No more.

The point is, I am trying my best to make sure the music and items NIN puts in the marketplace have value, substance and are worth you considering purchasing. I am not allowing [[Capital G]] to be repackaged into several configurations that result in you getting ripped off.

We are planning a full-length remix collection of substance that will be announced soon.|Trent Reznor|NIN.com<ref name="UMG">{{cite web |url= http://www.nin.com/tr |accessdate=2007-08-22 |last= Reznor |first= Trent |title= Updates from Trent |authorlink= Trent Reznor |date=[[2007-05-13]] |publisher= NIN.com |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070517041353rn_1/nin.com/tr/ |archivedate=2007-05-17}}</ref>|}}

Reznor's post, specifically his citing of the recording industry's "self-inflicted wounds," elicited considerable media attention.<ref name="Reznor Smashes UMG">{{cite web | title = Reznor Smashes UMG, Websites Write About It | publisher=The NIN Hotline | date = [[2007-05-17]] | url = http://www.theninhotline.net/news/archives/backissue/07/5#1179461909 | accessdate = 2007-05-19}}</ref>
