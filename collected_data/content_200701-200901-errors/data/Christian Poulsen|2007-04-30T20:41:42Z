'''Christian Bager Poulsen''' (born [[February 28]], [[1980]]) is a [[Denmark|Danish]] professional [[football (soccer)]] player who currently plays for [[Sevilla FC]]. He has been a regular member of the [[Denmark national football team]] since his debut in 2001, and has played more than 40 matches, scoring two goals. He represented Denmark at the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] and [[2004 UEFA European Football Championship|2004 European Championship]] tournaments.

==Biography==
Born in Asnæs, Christian Poulsen started playing youth football in the local club. He moved to amateur club [[Holbæk B&IF]], where he made his senior debut at 17 years of age, captaining the side on several occasions.<ref name="prøver">"FCK prøver ung Holbæk-spiller", ''[[Jyllands-Posten]]'', September 2, 2000</ref> He was called up for the Danish under-19 football team in September 1998, and played four games for the team. 

===National breakthrough===
In September 2000, he tried out for [[F.C. Copenhagen]] (FCK) in the top-flight [[Danish Superliga]] championship,<ref name="prøver"/> and signed his first professional contract with the club within a week. Poulsen got his breakthrough in Denmark when he took a commanding role in the attacking midfield of FCK, following the heart problems of former [[Norway national football team|Norwegian international]] midfielder [[Ståle Solbakken]] in March 2001. Poulsen quickly made his mark on the league, and helped his club win the [[Danish Superliga 2000-01|2000-01 Superliga]] championship. He scored to 1-0 in the 3-1 win against second-placed [[Brøndby IF]], which secured the league title. 

Following a good start of the 2001-02 season, Poulsen was called up for the Danish national team by national manager [[Morten Olsen]]. He got his debut when he started the 1-1 draw with the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] on [[November 10]], [[2001]]. FCK ended runners-up in the [[Danish Superliga 2001-02|2001-02 Superliga]], and Poulsen was named FCK ''Player of the Year'' 2002. Christian Poulsen was called up for the Danish squad for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], where he was initially used as a substitute. He took part in all three group stage matches, gradually getting more playing time in each game. Following two [[yellow card]]s in the group stage, he was suspended when Denmark were eliminated in the knock-out phase.

===Moving abroad===
[[Image:Schalke Poulsen01.jpg|thumb|Poulsen at Schalke 04.]]
After the 2002 World Cup, Poulsen made a [[Euro|€]]7M move, the most expensive sale by a Danish club at the time,<ref>{{da icon}} [http://www.dr.dk/Sporten/Fodbold/Int.fodbold/2006/01/11/100306.htm Daniel Agger skifter til Liverpool], [[Danmarks Radio]], January 11, 2006</ref> to [[Germany|German]] club [[FC Schalke 04]], where he looked to take over the position as [[holding midfielder]] left by veteran [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech international]] [[Jiří Němec]]. His start in Schalke was made easier by the fact that his team mate in the Danish national team, [[Ebbe Sand]], also played for the club. Through his time at Schalke, Poulsen played a number of matches at right back, but eventually secured himself a spot in the central midfield for both club and country.

Poulsen was selected for the [[2004 UEFA European Football Championship|2004 European Championship]], where he would play a controversial role. Following the 0-0 draw with [[Italy national football team|Italy]], Danish television showed Poulsen being spat on by Italian [[Francesco Totti]], who received a three-match ban and gave a "full public apology", though still claiming he was provoked by Poulsen.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/euro_2004/italy/3818559.stm Totti ban confirmed], [[BBC Sport]], June 18, 2004</ref> Poulsen played three of Denmark's four games, before the team was eliminated from the tournament.

In the 2005-06 [[UEFA Champions League]] tournament, Poulsen and Schalke were in the same preliminary group as Italian team [[A.C. Milan]]. Following their first match, a 2-2 draw, Poulsen was described as "a coward" by A.C. Milan coach [[Carlo Ancelotti]],<ref>[http://www.sportinglife.com/football/cups/championsleague/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=international_feed/05/09/29/SOCCER_Ita-AC_Milan_Poulsen.html ANCELOTTI FURIOUS AT POULSEN], Sporting Life, September 13, 2005</ref> this time for Poulsen's marking of A.C. Milan's [[Brazil]]ian playmaker [[Kaká]]. Schalke were eliminated from the Champions League tournament, as A.C. Milan won their second match 3-2, despite a goal by Christian Poulsen. Following the final whistle, Italian player [[Gennaro Gattuso]] steered towards Poulsen and confronted him.<ref>[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=188825&cc=3888 AC Milan 3-2 Schalke: Giants stutter through], [[Soccernet]], December 6, 2005</ref> Gattuso made gloating taunts, while Poulsen gave him an ironic [[thumbs up]], afterwards declaring he found Gattuso childish and hoped he felt embarrassed for himself.<ref>{{da icon}} [http://www.dr.dk/Sporten/Fodbold/Champions+League/2005/12/06/232955.htm Poulsen: Gattuso opførte sig som et barn], [[Danmarks Radio]], December 6, 2005</ref> His displays for Schalke and the Danish national team earned him the 2005 [[Danish Player of the Year|Danish ''Player of the Year'']] award.

In June 2006, Christian Poulsen's contract with Schalke ran out. Long-lasting rumours linked him to several teams, including Italian clubs [[Internazionale F.C.]] and A.C. Milan, despite the earlier Italian criticism of Poulsen's playing style.<ref>{{it icon}} Carlo Laudisa, [http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/Squadre/Milan/Primo_Piano/2006/03_Marzo/30/pulsen.shtml Milan, arriva Poulsen], ''[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]'', 30 March, 2006</ref> He eventually signed a contract with defending [[UEFA Cup]] champions [[Sevilla FC]] from Spain. In his debut match for the club, Poulsen helped Sevilla win the [[European Super Cup]] trophy, with a 3-0 victory against [[FC Barcelona]] on August 25. Following his first month at the club, he was named the best new signing in Spain by Spanish sports daily [[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]].<ref>{{da icon}} Anders B. Rasmussen, [http://sporten.tv2.dk/fodbold/article.php/id-4927688.html Marca: Poulsens bedste indkøb], [[TV 2 (Denmark)]], September 21, 2006</ref> He became the first player to be named Danish ''Player of the Year'' for two consecutive years, when he also won the 2006 award.
