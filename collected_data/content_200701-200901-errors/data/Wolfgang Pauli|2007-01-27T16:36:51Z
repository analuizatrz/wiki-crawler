'''Wolfgang Ernst Pauli''' ([[April 25]], [[1900]] &ndash; [[December 15]], [[1958]]) was an [[Austria]]n [[theoretical physicist]] noted for his work on the theory of [[spin (physics)|spin]], and in particular the discovery of the [[Pauli exclusion principle|Exclusion principle]], which underpins the whole of [[chemistry]].

== Biography ==
Pauli was born in [[Vienna]] to Wolfgang Joseph Pauli and Berta Camilla Schütz. His middle name was given in honor of his [[Godparent|godfather]], the physicist [[Ernst Mach]]. Pauli's father, Wolfgang Pauli, Sr. (originally Wolf Pascheles), whose parents came from prominent Jewish families of Prague, converted from [[Judaism]] to [[Roman Catholicism]] shortly before his marriage in 1899.  Bertha Schütz was raised in her mother's Roman Catholic religion, but her father was the Jewish writer Friedrich Schütz.  Although Pauli was raised as a Roman Catholic, eventually he (and his parents) left the Church. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jinfo.org/Physicists.html|title=Jewish Physicists|access_date=2006-09-30}}</ref>

Pauli attended the Döblinger-Gymnasium in Vienna, graduating with distinction in 1918. Only two months after graduation, the young [[child prodigy|prodigy]] had published his first [[scientific paper|paper]], on [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] theory of [[general relativity]]. He attended the [[Ludwig-Maximilian University]] of Munich, working under [[Arnold Sommerfeld|Sommerfeld]], where he received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate]] in July [[1921]] for a thesis on the quantum theory of ionised [[molecular hydrogen]].

Sommerfeld asked Pauli to review the [[theory of relativity]] for the ''Encyklopaedie der mathematischen Wissenschaften'', a German [[encyclopedia]]. Two months after receiving his doctorate, Pauli completed the article, which came to 237 pages. It was praised by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]; published as a [[monograph]], it remains a standard reference on the subject to this day.

He spent a year at the [[University of Göttingen]] as the assistant to [[Max Born]], and the following year at what became the [[Niels Bohr Institute]] for Theoretical Physics in [[Copenhagen]]. He then spent [[1923]] to [[1928]] as a lecturer at the [[University of Hamburg]]. During this period, Pauli was instrumental in the development of the modern theory of [[quantum mechanics]]. In particular, he formulated the [[Pauli exclusion principle|exclusion principle]] and the theory of nonrelativistic [[spin (physics)|spin]]. (See below for a list of his scientific contributions.)

In May [[1929]], Pauli left the Roman Catholic Church; in December that year, he married Käthe Margarethe Deppner. The marriage was an unhappy one, ending in divorce in [[1930]] after less than a year.

===Metaphysical crisis===
At the beginning of [[1931]], shortly after his divorce and immediately following his postulation of the [[neutrino]], Pauli had a severe breakdown. He consulted the psychiatrist and psychotherapist [[Carl Jung]] who, like Pauli, lived near [[Zurich]]. Jung immediately began to interpret his deeply [[archetypal]] dreams and Pauli became one of the depth psychologist’s best students. Soon, he began to scientifically criticize the [[epistemology]] of Jung’s theory and contributed like this to a certain clarification of the latter’s thoughts, especially about the concept of [[synchronicity]]. A great deal of these discussions is documented in the Pauli/Jung letters, today published as “[[Atom and Archetype]]”. Jung's elaborate analysis of more than 400 of Pauli's dreams is documented in “[[Psychology and Alchemy]]” (see below). 

In [[1928]], he was appointed Professor of Theoretical Physics at the [[ETH Zurich]] in [[Switzerland]] where he made significant scientific progress. He held visiting professorships at the [[University of Michigan]] in [[1931]], and the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]] in [[1935]]. He was awarded the [[Lorentz Medal]] in [[1931]].

In [[1934]], he married [[Franciska Bertram]]. This marriage would last for the rest of his life. They had no children.

The German annexation of Austria in [[1938]] made him a German citizen, which became a difficulty with the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]] in [[1939]]. Pauli moved to the United States in [[1940]], where he was Professor of Theoretical Physics at Princeton. After the end of the war, he became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States in 1946 before returning to [[Zurich]], where he mostly remained for the rest of his life.

Also in [[1945]], he received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for his "decisive contribution through his discovery in 1925 of a new law of Nature, the exclusion principle or [[Pauli principle]]." He had been nominated for the prize by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]].

In [[1958]], Pauli was awarded the [[Max Planck medal]]. In that same year, he fell ill with [[pancreatic cancer]]. When his last assistant, Charles Enz, visited him at the Rotkreuz hospital in [[Zurich]], Pauli asked him: “Did you see the room number?” It was number 137. Throughout his life, Pauli had been preoccupied with the question of why the [[fine structure constant]], a [[dimensional analysis|dimensionless]] fundamental constant, has a value nearly equal to 1/137. Pauli died in that room on [[December 15]], [[1958]].

==Scientific career==
Pauli made many important contributions in his career as a physicist, primarily in the subject of [[quantum mechanics]]. He seldom published papers, preferring lengthy correspondences with colleagues (such as [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]] and [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]], with whom he had close friendships.) Many of his ideas and results were never published and appeared only in his letters, which were often copied and circulated by their recipients. Pauli was apparently unconcerned that much of his work thus went uncredited. The following are the most important results for which he ''has'' been credited:

In [[1924]], Pauli proposed a new quantum degree of freedom to resolve inconsistencies between observed molecular spectra and the developing theory of [[quantum mechanics]]. He formulated the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], perhaps his most important work, which stated that no two electrons could exist in the same quantum state. The idea of spin had originated with [[Ralph Kronig]]. [[George Uhlenbeck|Uhlenbeck]] and [[Samuel Goudsmit|Goudsmit]] one year later identified this degree of freedom as [[electron]] [[spin (physics)|spin]].

In [[1926]], shortly after [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] published the matrix theory of modern [[quantum mechanics]], Pauli used it to derive the observed spectrum of the [[hydrogen atom]]. This result was important in securing credibility for Heisenberg's theory.

In [[1927]], he introduced the [[Pauli matrices]] as a basis of spin operators, thus solving the nonrelativistic theory of spin. This work is sometimes said to have influenced [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]] in his discovery of the [[Dirac equation]] for the [[relativistic particle|relativistic]] electron, though Dirac stated that he invented these same matricies himself independently at the time, without Pauli's influence. Dirac invented similar but larger spin matricies for use in his relativistic treatment of fermionic spin.

In [[1930]], Pauli considered the problem of [[beta decay]].  In a letter of Dec 4 beginning "Dear radioactive ladies and gentlemen" (to Lise Meitner et al.), he proposed the existence of a hitherto unobserved neutral particle with a small mass (no greater than 1% the mass of a proton), in order to explain the continuous spectrum of [[beta decay]]. In [[1934]], [[Enrico Fermi|Fermi]] incorporated the particle, which he called a [[neutrino]], into his theory of [[beta decay]]. The neutrino was first observed experimentally in [[1959]].

In [[1940]], he proved the [[spin-statistics theorem]], a critical result of quantum field theory which states that particles with half-integer spin are [[fermion]]s, while particles with integer spin are [[boson]]s.

== Personality and reputation ==
The [[Pauli effect]] was named after his bizarre ability to break experimental equipment simply by being in the vicinity. Pauli himself was aware of his reputation, and delighted whenever the Pauli effect manifested. 

Regarding physics, Pauli was famously perfectionist. This extended not just to his own work, but also to the work of his colleagues. As a result, he became known within the physics community as the "conscience of physics", the critic to whom his colleagues were accountable. He could be scathing in his dismissal of any theory he found lacking, often labelling it ''ganz falsch'', utterly false. 

However, this was not his most severe criticism, which he reserved for theories or theses so unclearly presented as to be untestable or unevaluatable, and thus not properly belonging within the realm of science, even though posing as such. There were worse than wrong because they could not be proven wrong.  Famously, he once said of such an unclear paper: "It is not ''even'' wrong."

A well-known joke about Pauli in the physics community goes as follows: After his death, Pauli was granted an audience with [[God]]. Pauli asked God why the [[fine structure constant]] has the value 1/(137.036...). God nodded, went to a blackboard, and began scribbling equations at a furious pace. Pauli watched Him at first with great satisfaction, but soon began shaking his head violently: "''Das ist ganz falsch!''"

== Modern pop culture ==
Pauli was referenced in an episode of the animated television series [[Futurama]], where several varieties of beer from the 30th century were featured, including "St. Pauli's Exclusion Principle Beer", a take-off on the "St. Pauli Girl Beer" brand.
