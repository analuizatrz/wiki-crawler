[[image:Marine_Atlantic_ferry_ports.png|thumb|right|250px|Marine Atlantic ferry ports and current routes]]
'''Marine Atlantic Inc.''' (fr: '''Marine Atlantique''') is an independent [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Crown corporation]] offering [[ferry]] services between the provinces of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] and [[Nova Scotia]].

Marine Atlantic was established in [[1986]] to take over the provision of ferry services in [[Atlantic Canada]] which had previously been operated by [[CN Marine]], a subsidiary of [[Canadian National Railway]].

Marine Atlantic's corporate headquarters are in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador]].

==Current routes==
Currently, Marine Atlantic operates ferries between [[North Sydney, Nova Scotia]] and [[Channel-Port aux Basques, Newfoundland and Labrador|Port aux Basques]], [[Newfoundland]] route year-round (96 [[nautical mile]]s).  This route is mandated under Newfoundland's "Terms of Union" in the [[Constitution of Canada]].  This route was assumed by [[Canadian National Railway]] in [[1949]] from the [[Newfoundland Railway]], upon [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland's]] entry into [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]].

Marine Atlantic also operates a seasonal service on a route between North Sydney and [[Argentia|Argentia, Newfoundland]] (280 [[nautical mile]]s).

==Current vessels==
Marine Atlantic owns and operates 3 ''Ro-Pax'' (roll-on, roll-off, passenger) vessels and 1 vessel dedicated for [[semi-trailer truck]]/cargo traffic.

===Gulfspan vessels===
The ''[[MV Caribou]]'' and the ''[[MV Joseph and Clara Smallwood]]'' are the largest ferry vessels operating in [[North America]].  Classed "100A1" by [[Lloyd's of London|Lloyd's]] with an ice classification of "Northern Baltic 1A Super," these vessels have similar dimensions as medium-sized [[cruise ship]]s.  They are based on a unique Canadian hull-design called ''Gulfspan'', which permits the ships to slice through sea ice rather than riding up onto and crushing it as conventional icebreakers do.  Their dimensions are 27,000 registered [[Tonnage|tons]] and 179 metres long, carrying 1,200 passengers, 100 crew, and 370 automobile-equivalent vehicles.

===Other vessels===
''[[MV Leif Ericson|MV Leif Ericson]]'' is the company's third passenger ferry, having been purchased in 2001.  Significantly smaller and a less-capable [[icebreaker]] than the ''Gulfspan'' vessels, this ferry's dimensions are 4,600 registered [[Tonnage|tons]] and 157 metres long, carrying 500 passengers, and 250 automobile-equivalent vehicles.  ''Atlantic Freighter'' is the company's dedicated freight and cargo vessel.

==History==
Extensive budget cuts by the [[Government of Canada]] during the latter part of the [[1990s]] led to a drastic downsizing of Marine Atlantic's operations.

In [[1997]] the [[Confederation Bridge]] replaced Marine Atlantic's constitutionally-mandated ferry service to [[Prince Edward Island]].

That same year saw the operation of the Saint John-Digby and Yarmouth-Bar Harbor services transferred to the private-sector company [[Bay Ferries Limited]], a subsidiary of [[Northumberland Ferries Limited]].

Marine Atlantic also removed itself from the provision of coastal ferry services in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] with the transfer of operations to the provincial government at the end of the [[1997]] season, in exchange for federal funding to extend regional roads (such as the [[Trans-Labrador Highway]]) to service coastal communities.  These coastal ferry services had been initiated by the [[Newfoundland Railway]] and were assumed by [[Canadian National Railways]], following the province's entry into [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] in [[1949]], although they were not constitutionally mandated.

In [[1998]], the company moved its headquarters from [[Moncton, New Brunswick]] to [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador]], after briefly considering [[North Sydney, Nova Scotia]] and [[Channel-Port aux Basques, Newfoundland and Labrador|Port aux Basques, Newfoundland and Labrador]].

In late [[2004]] the federal government announced the appointment of a three-member committee tasked with examining future operations of Marine Atlantic.  One of the options being considered is reportedly [[privatization]].
