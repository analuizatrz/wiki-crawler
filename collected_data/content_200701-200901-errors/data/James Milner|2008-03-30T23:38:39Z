'''James Philip Milner''' (born [[4 January]] [[1986]]) is an [[English people|English]] [[football (soccer)|footballer]] who plays as a [[winger (sport)|winger]] and left-sided [[midfielder]] for the English club [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]. He has previously played for the English clubs [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]], [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]], and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]].

His talent in football, [[cricket]], and [[long-distance track event|long-distance running]] was recognised when he was a child. He represented his school in these sports and played football for amateur teams from [[Rawdon, West Yorkshire|Rawdon]] and [[Horsforth]]. He supported [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] from a young age and was a [[season ticket]] holder at the club. Milner began his career at Leeds United by joining the club's academy in 1996; he was later<!--year? it was after he left school--> taken on as a trainee. Milner made his inaugural appearance for the first team in 2002, aged only 16, and gained prominence as the youngest player to score in the [[Premier League]]. 

While at Leeds United, he spent time on loan at [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] to gain experience as a first-team player. Following his move to Newcastle United, he was loaned to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] for a season. He has since established himself as a regular starter in the Newcastle first team. His main role on the team is to create scoring opportunities. He has now made more than 100 appearances for Newcastle, as well as making a record number of appearances for the [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21]] side.

==Early life==
Born in [[Wortley, West Yorkshire|Wortley]], and raised in [[Horsforth]], [[Leeds]], Milner played most of his childhood football for Westbrook School in Horsforth. He was later educated at [[Boston Spa School]]. Graeme Coulson, a coach from [[Rawdon, West Yorkshire|Rawdon]], recognised Milner's talent and persuaded him to play for Rawdon in several tournaments, including a tournament at Rawdon Meadows, where Milner scored four goals in their victory in the final.<ref name="Milner child"/>

He played for the Yorkshire Schools cricket team, was the cross-country champion at his school for three consecutive years and was the district champion over 100&nbsp;metres for two years in a row.<ref name="Milner child"/> 

Milner took as much interest in watching football as he did playing it. He supported the professional football club [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] from a young age. His earliest memory of Leeds is of watching them win the [[FA Youth Cup]] in 1993. He and his parents, Peter and Lesley, were [[season ticket]] holders for Leeds United, for which Milner became a [[ballboy#Sport|ballboy]].<ref name="findarticles">{{cite web

When Milner was 10 years old, he joined the Leeds United Academy after being spotted by a [[scout (sport)|scout]] while playing for [[Horsforth#Education|Westbrook]] Juniors in Horsforth.<ref name="Milner child"/> At the academy, Milner played against contemporaries from other clubs in the north, including future [[Manchester United]] striker [[Wayne Rooney]]. His role model was Leeds-born [[Alan Smith]], who was then a Leeds United striker. Milner believed playing with Smith put him through a learning curve, as Smith had done what Milner aspired to do; that is, to come through the academy and play for the first team.<ref name="findarticles"/> Having made good progress at the Academy, Milner was taken on as a trainee after leaving school.<ref name="Milner child"/> However, his father insisted that he attend college once a week to continue his education.<ref name="findarticles2">{{cite web

==Career==

===Leeds United===
[[Image:Th milnerleeds.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Milner with Leeds during the [[2002-03 in English football|2002&ndash;03 season]]]]
Milner's debut for Leeds United came on [[10 November]] [[2002]], in a game against [[West Ham United]], when he came on as a [[substitute (football)|substitute]] for [[Jason Wilcox]] for the last six minutes. The appearance made him the second youngest player ever to play in the [[Premier League]], at the age of 16 years and 309 days.<ref name="ESPN"/> On [[Boxing Day]] of that year, he became the youngest player to score in the Premier League, with a goal in a 2&ndash;1 win against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]].<ref>{{cite web

In a match against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] a month later, Milner scored again, using first touch of the ball that was described as "a beauty", to avoid a tackle from Chelsea defender [[Marcel Desailly]]. This created a yard of space for him to deliver a shot that curled towards the goal from {{convert|18|yd|m|0}} away.<ref name="Chelsea goal">{{cite web

At the start of the [[2003-04 in English football|2003&ndash;04 season]], Milner was sent on a month-long loan to [[Football League One|Division Two]] side [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] to gain experience as a first-team player. Before the stint, he saw it as a valuable experience as a player.<ref name="findarticles"/> He spent a month with Swindon, scoring two goals in six games. Milner also continued to develop on the international scene. He represented England at Under-20 level at the [[2003 FIFA World Youth Championship|2003 World Youth Championship]]. Soon after this, Under-21 manager [[Peter Taylor (footballer born 1953)|Peter Taylor]] called him up to the [[England national under-21 football team|England Under-21 side]] and Milner made his debut against [[Sweden national under-21 football team|Sweden]] on [[30 March]] [[2004]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Chopra earns U21s draw | author=Gerry Cox |

However, Leeds United's fortunes were different as they struggled in the league. The team received a lot of negative attention from the media, and several first-team players were sold. Milner said he believed that this experience made him emotionally stronger and taught him how to deal with team problems.<ref name="findarticles"/> Leeds' eventual [[promotion and relegation|relegation]] to the [[Football League Championship|Championship]] led to speculation over Milner's future at the club. [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] all expressed an interest in signing him.<ref name="ESPN">{{cite web

The final total paid was £5,000,000, after a certain number of appearances for the new club. Although Milner was not happy to be leaving the club he had supported as a child, he wished to do what was "in the club's best interest"<ref name="findarticles">{{cite web

Milner's first Premier League game for Newcastle came against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] on [[18 August]] [[2004]], in which he played on the extreme right of the field as a [[Winger (sport)|winger]], despite having featured regularly on the left for Leeds.

However, the situation changed for Milner after Newcastle manager [[Bobby Robson]], whom Milner considered his mentor, was sacked and replaced by [[Graeme Souness]]. Under Souness, he started 13 league games, but did not play his first full Premier League game for Newcastle until April 2005. By the end of the season, he had made 41 appearances in all competitions and scored once. Souness did not make Milner a regular in the Newcastle side and controversially remarked that the club would not win "with a team of James Milners". Milner's response to this statement was reported as "mature".<ref name="Rooney">{{cite web

Villa made an improved offer on [[30 August]], which was accepted by Newcastle chairman [[Freddy Shepherd]]. Media sources quoted the transfer fee as being £4,000,000.

====Return to Newcastle United====
[[Image:James Milner 17.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Milner takes a free kick during the [[2006-07 in English football|2006–07 season]]]]
Newcastle's players and manager [[Glenn Roeder]] reacted positively to Milner's return at the start of the [[2006-07 in English football|2006&ndash;07]] season.<ref>{{cite web

Roeder confirmed that he would play Milner in "plenty of games" during the season. This proved to be the case, as Milner was a starter in the Newcastle side for the entire season.<ref name="Roeder"/> 

He also continued to make progress at international level, scoring the winning goal for the England Under-21 side in a 3&ndash;2 win over [[Switzerland national under-21 football team|Switzerland]]. The win secured England a place in the playoff stage of the [[2007 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|2007 Under-21 European Championship]] qualifiers.<ref>{{cite web

Both of these were scored from at least {{convert|20|yd|m|-1}} away. Later in the season, Roeder praised the progress Milner had made and said that he believed him to be the hardest-training player at the club.

In June, Milner competed for England at the [[European Under-21 Football Championship]]. He played in all four of England's matches and was booked in the semi-final against [[Netherlands national under-21 football team|the Netherlands]], which meant he would have missed the final. The game was decided by a penalty shootout, in which Milner scored twice and England lost 13&ndash;12.<ref>{{cite web
