Jackson | url=http://www.pbs.org/kcet/tavissmiley/archive/200602/20060224.html | accessdate=August 20 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Jackson then flew to Memphis to join an equal rights protest march.

Rap Brown]] and others active in the [[Black Power]] movement.<ref name="Parade.com"/> Jackson revealed in the same ''Parade'' interview that he began to feel empowered with his involvement in the movement, especially when the group began buying guns.<ref name="Parade.com"/> However, before Jackson could become involved with any significant armed struggle, his mother sent him to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] after the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|F.B.I.]] told her that he would die within a year if he remained with the Black Power movement.<ref name="Parade.com"/>

==Acting career==
===1970s - 1980s===
Jackson initially decided to go to Morehouse College to major in Architecture, but decided to change his major to Drama<ref name="tributeca.com">{{cite web | title=tributeca.com | work=Star Bios: Samuel L. Jackson | url=http://www.tribute.ca/bio.asp?id=2040 | accessdate=December 3 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> after taking a public speaking class and appearing in a version of ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]''.<ref name="cnn">{{cite web | title=CNN.com | work=Samuel L. Jackson: Samurai and snakes | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/Movies/08/21/film.qa.samuel.l.jackson.ap/ | accessdate=August 21 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Jackson began acting in multiple plays including ''Home'' and ''A Soldier's Story''. He also landed himself in several TV films, and his first feature film was in ''[[Together for Days]]'' ([[1972 in film|1972]]). After these initial roles, Jackson proceeded to move from Atlanta to New York City in [[1976]] and spent the next decade appearing in stage plays such as ''The Piano Lesson'' and ''Two Trains Running'' with the Negro Ensemble Company and the New York Shakespeare Company.<ref name="Hollywoodfirm">{{cite web | title=Hollywoodfirm.com | work=Biographies: Samuel L. Jackson | url=http://www.hollywoodfirm.com/Biographies/jackson.htm | accessdate=December 3 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> At this point in his early career, Jackson developed an alcohol and cocaine addiction, resulting in him being unable to proceed with the two plays as they continued to Broadway (actors [[Charles S. Dutton]] and [[Laurence Fishburne]] took his place).<ref name="Yahoo Movies.com"/> Throughout his early film career, mainly in minimal roles in films and TV films, Jackson was mentored by [[Morgan Freeman]].<ref name="tiscali.film & tv"/> After a [[1981]] performance in the play ''A Soldier's Play'', Jackson was introduced to beginning director [[Spike Lee]]<ref name="Yahoo Movies.com"/> who would later include him in small roles for the films ''[[School Daze]]'' ([[1988 in film|1988]]) and ''[[Do the Right Thing]]'' ([[1989 in film|1989]]).

===1990s===
[[Image:Samburgar.JPG|thumb|220px|left|Jackson as Jules Winnfield in ''Pulp Fiction'', 1994]]
After completing these films, Jackson's cocaine addiction continued to increase to the point where  he overdosed, and his family entered him into a New York rehab clinic.<ref name="tiscali.film & tv"/> When he successfully completed rehab, Jackson acted in ''[[Jungle Fever]]'', as the cocaine addict brother to the relatively new actor [[Wesley Snipes]]. The film was so acclaimed that the 1991 [[Cannes Film Festival]] awarded  a special "Supporting Actor" award just for him.<ref name="Hollywood.com">{{cite web | title=Hollywood.com | work=Samuel L. Jackson | url=http://www.hollywood.com/celebs/fulldetail/id/190189 | accessdate=November 30 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> After this role, Jackson became involved with multiple film requests, including ''[[Strictly Business]]'', ''[[Juice (film)|Juice]]'', ''[[Patriot Games (film)|Patriot Games]]'', and then moving on to two comedies: ''[[Loaded Weapon 1|National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1]]'' and ''[[Amos & Andrew]]''. After these rapid films involvement, Jackson worked with director [[Steven Spielberg]] in ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' and up-and-coming director [[Quentin Tarantino]] in ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]''. The film was perhaps Jackson's most notable role, mainly for his monologues and one-liners along with co-star [[John Travolta]]. The film earned Jackson an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] and a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] Best Supporting Actor award win.<ref name="FilmBug">{{cite web | title=FilmBug.com | work=Samuel L. Jackson | url=http://www.filmbug.com/db/314 | accessdate=December 3 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

With a succession of unsuccessful films such as ''[[Kiss of Death]]'', ''[[The Great White Hype]]'', and ''[[Losing Isaiah]]'', Jackson began to receive poor reviews from critics who were just praising him before with ''Pulp Fiction''. This ended with his involvement in the two successful box office films ''[[A Time to Kill (film)|A Time To Kill]]'', where he depicted a father who is put on trial for killing two men who raped his daughter, and ''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]'', co-starring along side [[Bruce Willis]] in the third installment of the ''[[Die Hard]]'' series. For ''A Time to Kill'', Jackson earned a NAACP Image for Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture.<ref name="SuperiorPics.com">{{cite web | title=SuperiorPics.com | work=Samuel L. Jackson | url=http://www.superiorpics.com/samuel_l__jackson/ | accessdate=December 3 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

Quickly becoming a box office star, Jackson continued with three starring roles in 1997. In ''[[One Eight Seven|187]]'' he played a teacher, dedicated to educating students in a [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] high school. He received an Independent Spirit award for Best First Feature<ref name="SuperiorPics.com"/> alongside first-time writer/director [[Kasi Lemmons]] in the drama film ''[[Eve's Bayou]]'', for which he also served as executive producer.

In [[1999]], Jackson starred in a shark horror film, ''[[Deep Blue Sea]]'', and as [[Jedi|Jedi Master]] [[Mace Windu]] in [[George Lucas]]'s ''[[Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace]]''. In an interview, Jackson claimed that he did not have a chance to read the script for the film and did not learn he was playing the character Mace Windu until he was fitted for his costume.<ref name="BigFanBoy.com">{{cite web | title=BigFanBoy.com | work=SAMUEL L.

===2000s===
On [[June 13]], [[2000]], Jackson was honored with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] which can be found at 7018 Hollywood Blvd.<ref name="">{{cite web | title=The Hollywood Walk of Fame | work=Locations of Stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame | url=http://www.seeing-stars.com/Immortalized/WalkOfFameStars.shtml | accessdate=November 30 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

Jackson's sole film in [[2001]] was ''[[The Caveman's Valentine]]'', where he plays a homeless musician in a murder thriller. The film was directed by Kasi Lemmons, who previously worked with Jackson in ''Eve's Bayou''. In 2002, he played a recovering alcoholic attempting to keep custody of his kids while dealing with a mishap with [[Ben Affleck]]'s character in ''[[Changing Lanes]]''. He returned for ''[[Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones]]'', increasing his role from a small role to a supporting role. Mace Windu's purple lightsaber in the film was the result of Jackson's suggestion; he wanted to be sure that his character would stand out in a crowded battle scene.<ref name="WENN">{{cite web | title=World Entertainment News Network | work=Jackson Demands Purple Shaft | url=http://www.imdb.com/news/wenn/2002-05-07#celeb9 | accessdate=November 30 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Jackson then acted as a [[National Security Agency|NSA]] agent alongside [[Vin Diesel]] in ''[[XXX (film)|xXx]]'' and a drug dealer wearing a kilt in ''[[Formula 51]]''.

Jackson also returned for two sequels: ''[[XXX: State of the Union]]'', this time commanding [[Ice Cube]], and the final prequel George Lucas installment, ''[[Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith]]''. His last film for 2005 was ''[[The Man (2005 film)|The Man]]'' alongside comedian [[Eugene Levy]].
