Mac McWhorter, an All-SEC guard at Georgia in 1973, is a well-traveled offensive line coach who's considered one of the best in the business. McWhorter joined the Texas staff in 2002 after leaving Georgia Tech, where he served as interim coach for the Jackets' bowl game after George O'Leary left for Notre Dame.


McWhorter is credited with bringing toughness to a Texas line that used to be labeled "soft."


"Coach McWhorter brought back the blocking sled and put us in chutes to get our pads lower and just is constantly yelling at us to strain, pushing us beyond where we think we can go," senior guard Will Allen told the Dallas Morning News. "He believes in proper technique, but he also believes that passion and toughness can make up for a lot. His intense style brings that out in us."

Mac McWhorter is in his seventh year on UT's coaching staff. McWhorter serves as the Longhorns offensive line coach. He was promoted to Associate Head Coach in 2005. Four of the Longhorn linemen he has tutored are currently in the NFL.

McWhorter guided a line in 2007 that had to overcome the loss of three players to the NFL, including OG/T Justin Blalock (second round, Falcons), OG Kasey Studdard (seventh round, Texans) and C Lyle Sendlein (free agent, Arizona), and two of its senior starters to injury. OT Tony Hills, who was named first-team All-America by the Walter Camp Football Foundation, had his season cut short by two games, and C Dallas Griffin, who became Texas’ first Draddy Trophy winner and was first-team Academic All-America, missed the last three. Sophomore OT Adam Ulatoski also missed time, leading McWhorter to prepare three true freshmen (Tray Allen, Kyle Hix and Michael Huey) for significant action. But despite youth and frequently rotating lineups, the line still paved the way for 462.9 yards of total offense (13th NCAA), 207.5 yards rushing (17th NCAA) and 37.2 points per game (14th NCAA).

In 2006, McWhorter’s offensive line produced a unanimous All-American, four All-Big 12 performers and a Freshman All-American. Blalock became Texas’ fifth lineman to earn unanimous All-America honors. He finished his stellar four-year career by setting the UT record for consecutive starts with 51. He was also a finalist for the Lombardi Award and the Outland Trophy. Sendlein and Studdard both earned first-team All-Big 12 honors, while Hills was named honorable mention All-Big 12. With the loss of starter Cedric Dockery in the middle of the season to a knee injury, Ulatoski was forced to step in and responded by being named a Freshman All-American. 

The offensive line was the foundation for a National Championship and one of the top offensive seasons in NCAA history in 2005. Texas set an NCAA record for points scored with 652 and a UT record with 6,657 total yards. For the second consecutive year, Texas finished second nationally in rushing (274.9 ypg). Vince Young also reached 1,000 yards rushing to extend Texas’ national-leading streak of 1,000-yard rushers to 11 seasons. 

A year earlier, in 2004, the Longhorns also finished the season ranked second in the country in rushing offense (299.2 ypg), seventh in total offense (464.4 ypg) and 12th in scoring (35.3 ppg). UT rushed for at least 300 yards six times in 2004, the most since 1977. Under McWhorter’s tutelage, junior Jonathan Scott and sophomore Justin Blalock were both named first-team All-Big 12.

McWhorter began to handle the entire Longhorn line in 2003. Despite needing to replace two of five starters, UT ranked eighth nationally in rushing (232.5 ypg) and produced its most rushing yards (3,023) since 1977. Guard Tillman Holloway was a consensus first-team All-Big 12 pick and tackle Jonathan Scott earned All-Big 12 recognition. Tackle Justin Blalock earned first-team Freshman All-America honors (FWAA/Sporting News).

In his first season at Texas in 2002, McWhorter helped tutor first-team All-America OL Derrick Dockery, who worked at both guard and tackle.

McWhorter's coaching career includes stops as a head coach at both the collegiate and high school levels. As interim head coach for the bowl game in 2001, he directed the Yellow Jackets' win in the inaugural Seattle Bowl (tabbed Sports Illustrated's All-Bowl Team Head Coach). He had served as assistant head coach/offensive line under George O'Leary that year.

A 1974 graduate of the University of Georgia, his coaching career began as an assistant at Duluth (Ga.) High in 1974 and as an assistant at Douglas County (Ga.) High from 1975-78. McWhorter earned his first head coaching job in 1979 at Villa Rica (Ga.) High, where was named the Carroll County Coach of the Year.

He moved to the college ranks in 1980, when he was named to Bill Curry's staff at Georgia Tech. After working with the wide receivers for one season, he took over Tech's offensive line in 1981. McWhorter then was promoted to assistant head coach in 1985, and the Yellow Jackets posted a 9-2-1 record and played in the All-American Bowl. He also served as director of football operations from 1985-86.

In 1987, McWhorter joined Curry in a move to Alabama. In two seasons with the Crimson Tide, he served as assistant head coach, tutored the offensive line and was the director of football operations and an administrative assistant to the head coach.

In 1989, he was the head coach at Division II West Georgia College in Carrollton, Ga., before returning to the Atlantic Coast Conference as an assistant coach in charge of the offensive line, as well as director of football operations at Duke in 1990. He returned to his alma mater to join the staff of Ray Goff in 1991, when he served as the offensive line coach, special teams coordinator and director of football operations. While at Georgia, he helped the Bulldogs establish single-season school records for total yards (5,135 in 1994) and yards per rush (5.6 in 1992).

When Goff left Georgia in 1995, McWhorter moved to Clemson, where he was the offensive tackles and tight ends coach from 1996-98. He was responsible for developing 1997 All-America offensive lineman Jim Bundren. The Tigers led the ACC in rushing in 1996.

After spending a year as co-offensive coordinator and offensive line coach at Memphis in 1999, he returned to Tech as offensive line coach in 2000 and was promoted to assistant head coach in 2001.

McWhorter's line was a major factor in the Yellow Jackets' offensive success in 2000. After inheriting a unit that returned only two starters, he tutored a line that led the ACC in fewest sacks allowed and helped Tech’s offense rank among the top 20 nationally in scoring, passing and total offense. OT Chris Brown was consensus first-team All-America and OG Brent Key earned first-team All-ACC.

In 2001, McWhorter rebuilt an offensive line that started two freshmen and featured only one returning starter. True freshman OT Nat Dorsey earned first-team All-ACC and Freshman All-America honors.

McWhorter was a three-year letterwinner and two-year starter on the Georgia line under head coach Vince Dooley from 1971-73. He earned All-SEC honors as a senior. He also was a two-time Academic All-SEC pick (1972-73).

McWhorter and his wife, Rebecca, have three children, Kasey, Katie and Mac.
