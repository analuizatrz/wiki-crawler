==Playing career==
He spent 17 years with his hometown club [[Altay SK]] in İzmir, gaining a reputation as one of the best left-sided forwards in the [[Turkish Premier Super League|league]]. In [[1980]], he became topscorer with 12 goals. Denizli transferred then in [[1983]] to [[Galatasaray S.K.|Galatasaray]], but retired at the end of the season [[1983]]-[[1984]] from active sport. During his playing time, he was capped 10 times for the [[Turkish national football team|national team]].

==Managerial career==
He started his next career as the assistant coach to [[Germany|German]] [[Jupp Derwall]] and served three years in this position at Galatasaray. In [[1987]], he took over his master’s position as coach. For the same season, Denizli was appointed head coach of the Turkish national football team. In the season [[1988]]-[[1989]], he reached the semi-finals of the [[UEFA Champions League]] with Galatasaray, but the road to the final was blocked by [[Steaua Bucuresti]].

For the season [[1989]]-[[1990]], Denizli signed a contract with the German second league side [[Alemannia Aachen]]. Denizli had installed a new type of attacking football for the German club but he left from this club due to [[Alemannia Aachen]] was faced with relegation to third league. Returned back to Turkey after one season, he was responsible for Galatasaray again. The team won [[Turkish Football Cup|Turkish Cup]] under his management in [[1991]]-[[1992]] and played in the quarter finals of the [[Cup Winners Cup]]. From [[1992]] to [[1995]], he coached Kocaelispor and then he was appointed the second time head coach for the national team, he served until [[2000]].

Denizli is the first Turkish coach of Fenerbahçe ever to win the league championship, but he enjoyed a rather poor [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] run with defeats against [[FC Barcelona]] and [[Bayer Leverkusen]]. In 2002 the [[Nigerian national football team]] wanted to sign Denizli for their [[2002 Fifa World Cup|2002 World Cup]] campaign but due to several problems it was canceld.
