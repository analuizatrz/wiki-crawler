'''Michael Shawn Hickenbottom''' (born July 22, 1965), better known by his [[ring name]] '''Shawn Michaels''', is an American [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]]. He performs for [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE), formerly the World Wrestling Federation, on its [[WWE Raw|Raw]] [[WWE Brand Extension|brand]]. Hickenbottom is one of the senior performers in WWE, having joined in 1987. He is one of only two wrestlers, the other being [[The Undertaker]], to have appeared on the very first episode of ''Monday Night Raw'' who are still with the company today.

Hickenbottom began his wrestling career with [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Mid-South Wrestling]], now known as Universal Wrestling Federation, and [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA). During his time with AWA, he performed in partnership with [[Marty Jannetty]], as [[The Rockers|The Midnight Rockers]]; winning the [[AWA World Tag Team Championship]] twice. Hickenbottom and Jannetty then signed with World Wrestling Federation (WWF), while in contract with AWA. They returned to AWA, only to go back to the WWF in 1988.

Hickenbottom later worked as a sole performer, taking on a new persona of "The Heartbreak Kid." He was the leader of a backstage group known as [[The Kliq]], which was known for performing an unscripted act during the [[Madison Square Garden]] "[[The Kliq#Curtain Call: The MSG Incident|Curtain Call]]" incident in 1996. The following year, he teamed up with [[Triple H|Hunter Hearst Hemsley]], who often was referred to as Triple H (HHH), and [[Chyna]] to form [[D-Generation X]] (DX). This [[List of professional wrestling terms#S|group of wrestlers]] were known for their sophomoric crude humor. That same year, Hickenbottom took part in one of the most controversial matches in wrestling history, dubbed as the "[[Montreal Screwjob]]." After a back injury forced him to retire following his [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] loss at [[WrestleMania XIV]], Hickenbottom opened a wrestling academy, called [[Texas Wrestling Academy|The Shawn Michaels Wrestling Academy]], in which he trained upcoming wrestlers. He made his in-ring return at [[SummerSlam (2002)|SummerSlam]] in 2002. In 2006, Hickenbottom and Triple H briefly reformed DX, but after an injury that Triple H sustained, Hickenbottom returned to singles wrestling.

Overall, Hickenbottom has been a world champion four times, including three reigns as [[WWE Championship|WWE Champion]], and one reign as [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Champion]]. He was also the winner of the [[Royal Rumble (1995)|1995]] and [[Royal Rumble (1996)|1996]] [[Royal Rumble]] and was the company's first [[Grand Slam Championship|Grand Slam Champion]]. Aside from professional wrestling, Hickenbottom is a [[born-again Christian]], husband, and father of two children.

==Career==
===Early career (1984–1988)===
Hickenbottom began to train under Mexican professional wrestler [[Jose Lothario]].<ref name=stopper>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Wrestlemania20/2004/03/14/381421.html|title=Shawn Michaels, still the show-stopper|first=Jaya|last=Roopansingh|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]|work=Slam!

After his training with Lothario, he debuted as Shawn Michaels, with [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Mid-South Wrestling]] and Texas All-Star Wrestling (TAW) [[professional wrestling promotion|promotions]] in 1984.<ref name="HAT">{{cite video|year=2007|title=The Shawn Michaels Story: Heartbreak & Triumph|medium=DVD|publisher=[[WWE Home Video]]}}</ref> During his time with TAW, Michaels and Paul Diamond ([[Paul Diamond|Tom Boric]]) were awarded the TAW Tag Team Championship by Chavo Guerrero, Sr. ([[Chavo Guerrero, Sr.|Salvador Guerrero Llanes]]).<ref name="slam"/> He also worked for [[Heart of America Sports Attractions|Central States Wrestling]].<ref>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=75–77}}</ref> There, he and [[tag team]] partner Marty Jannetty ([[Marty Jannetty|Frederick Jannetty]]) defeated The Batten Twins for the [[NWA Central States Tag Team Championship|Central States Tag Team Championship]], later losing it back to the Battens.<ref name="slam"/> Michaels also made several appearances in the [[Dallas, Texas]]-based [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] throughout 1985.

Michaels made his national-level debut at the age of twenty in [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA), once again teaming with Marty Jannetty.<ref name=stopper/> The pair were billed as "[[The Rockers|The Midnight Rockers]]", and held the [[AWA World Tag Team Championship]], defeating [[Doug Somers]] and Buddy Rose ([[Buddy Rose|Paul Perschmann]]).<ref name=stopper/> In 1987, The Rockers were signed by a competing promotion: the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF).<ref name=stopper/> They were fired from WWF two weeks later, for a bar incident (a misunderstanding, according to Michaels' autobiography).<ref name=stopper/><ref name="sm116"/> They then returned to AWA, but were re-signed by WWF a year later.<ref name="sm116">{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=116–118}}</ref>

====The Rockers (1988–1991)====
{{main|The Rockers}}
The Rockers redebuted at a WWF [[house show]] on July 7, 1988.<ref>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=133}}</ref> Due to WWF chairman [[Vince McMahon]]'s desire to have his performers carry WWF-exclusive ring names, they were renamed, as simply "[[The Rockers]]."<ref name="HAT"/> The team proved popular with both children and women.<ref name=stopper/> The team was a mid-card stalwart of television and [[pay-per-view]] shows for the next two years.<ref name=sm148>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=148–150}}</ref>

In October 1990, The Rockers were scheduled to win the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]] from [[The Hart Foundation]] ([[Bret Hart]] and [[Jim Neidhart]]), as Neidhart, half of the championship team, was in the process of negotiating his release from the company.<ref name=sm148/> The match was taped with The Rockers winning the belts, but soon after, Neidhart came to an agreement with management and was rehired.<ref name=sm148/> The belts were returned to the Hart Foundation, while the title change was never broadcast or even acknowledged on television.<ref name=sm148/> When news spread, WWF explained that the original result was void due to a collapsed [[turnbuckle]] in the ring during the bout. A buckle had indeed broken, but not to a noticeable or dangerous extent during the match.<ref name="HAT"/> The Rockers plodded along, eventually splitting on December 2, 1991 during an incident on Brutus "The Barber" Beefcake's ([[Edward Leslie]]) televised ''Barber Shop'' talk show [[Promo (professional wrestling)|promotional segment]].<ref name=sm159>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=157–159}}</ref> Michaels [[superkick]]ed Jannetty and [[Defenestration|threw him]] through a [[Sugar glass|glass]] window on the set of Beefcake's talk show.<ref name=stopper/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.ign.com/articles/583/583410p1.html|title=IGN: Shawn Michaels Interview|last=Robinson|first=Jon|date=2005-01-28|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|work=[[IGN]] Sports|accessdate=2008-08-06}}</ref> Jannetty disappeared from the company, and Michaels became a villain as "The Boy Toy."<ref name=sm159/>

====Heartbreak Kid (1992–1995)====
{{see also|Shawn Michaels and Kevin Nash}}
At the suggestion of [[Curt Hennig|"Mr Perfect" Curt Hennig]], Michaels adopted the nickname "The Heartbreak Kid."<ref name=stopper/> Along with his new name came a new [[List of professional wrestling terms#G|gimmick]] as a vain, cocky villain.<ref name=shining>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCO/is_5_2/ai_68951382?tag=artBody;col1|title=7 Superstars Shining Brightly|first=Anderson|last=Steve|publisher=Find Articles.com|work=Wrestling Digest|accessdate=2008-07-17|month=February|year=2001}}</ref> He was put together with mirror-carrying [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]], Sensational Sherri ([[Sherri Martel|Sherri Schrull]]), who, according to the storyline, had become infatuated with him.<ref name=sm159/> Sherri even sang the first version of his new [[theme music]], "[[Music in professional wrestling#M|Sexy Boy]]."<ref name="HAT"/> During that period, Michaels normally wrestled during the first half of house shows, and his departure was announced with the words, "Shawn Michaels has left the building" (alluding to the phrase "[[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] has left the building").<ref>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=165–166}}</ref>

[[Image:Shawn Michaels in 1994.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Michaels at a live event in 1994]]
Michaels failed to win the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Championship]] from Bret Hart in July 1992, even losing the WWF's first-ever [[ladder match]] against him at a house show, a match where the objective was to climb a ladder and reach an object hanging above the ring.<ref>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=161–162}}</ref> He, however, won the title from The British Bulldog ([[Davey Boy Smith|David Smith]]) on the [[Saturday Night's Main Event results#Saturday Night's Main Event XXXI|October 27, 1992 edition]] of ''[[WWE Saturday Night's Main Event|Saturday Night's Main Event]]'', which aired on November 8.<ref name=IC-title>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/intercontinental/|title=Title History: Intercontinental|accessdate=2008-07-17|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}</ref> Shortly thereafter, he was in a pay-per-view main event for the first time, in which he lost to Hart, for the [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] at the [[Survivor Series (1992)|1992 Survivor Series]].<ref>{{cite news|title=2007 Wrestling Almanac & Book of Facts|work=Wrestling’s Historical Cards|publisher=Kappa Publishing|year=2007|pages=90–91}}</ref> Michaels and Hart were moved to the main event after The Ultimate Warrior ([[Warrior (wrestler)|Brian Hellwig]]) was unable to compete in the tag team match that involved Randy Savage ([[Randy Savage|Randall Poffo]]) against the team of Ric Flair ([[Ric Flair|Richard Fliehr]]) and Razor Ramon ([[Scott Hall]]).<ref>{{cite book|title=Wrestlecrap: The Very Worst of Pro Wrestling|last=Baer|first=Randy|coauthors=Reynolds, R.D.|publisher=[[ECW Press]]|year=2003|isbn=1-55022-584-7|pages=74}}</ref> During this time, Michaels and Sherri split and he engaged himself in a feud with former tag team partner Marty Jannetty.<ref name=stopper/> Michaels lost the Intercontinental Championship to Jannetty on ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'' on May 17, 1993.<ref name=IC-title/> He then regained it on June 6 with the help of his debuting "[[bodyguard]]" (and off-air friend) Diesel ([[Kevin Nash]]).<ref name="HAT"/><ref name=IC-title/>

In September 1993, Michaels had quit the company, after it was announced that he had failed to defend his title enough times during a set period; in reality, he had been suspended for testing positive for [[steroid]]s&nbsp;– a charge that Michaels denies to this day.<ref>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=182}}</ref> After turning down [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW)'s advances, Michaels returned to the WWF and made several appearances in the [[United States Wrestling Association]] (USWA) during a WWF/USWA cross-promotion. He returned to WWF television for November's [[Survivor Series (1993)|Survivor Series]] pay-per-view, substituting for [[Jerry Lawler]], who was dealing with legal issues, in a match pitting himself and three of Lawler's "Knights" against the Hart brothers, Bret, [[Bruce Hart (wrestler)|Bruce]], [[Keith Hart (wrestler)|Keith]], and [[Owen Hart|Owen]].<ref name=pwi92>{{cite news|title=2007 Wrestling Almanac & Book of Facts|work=Wrestling’s Historical Cards|publisher=Kappa Publishing|year=2007|pages=91–92}}</ref>

He soon entered a [[Feud (professional wrestling)|staged rivalry]] with Razor Ramon, who had won the vacated Intercontinental Championship, during Michaels' absence.<ref name="ladderbegin">{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=182–187}}</ref> Since Michaels had never been defeated in the ring for the title, he claimed to be the rightful champion and even carried around his old title belt.<ref name="ladderbegin"/> This feud culminated in a ladder match between the two at [[WrestleMania X]].<ref name="ladderbegin"/> Michaels lost the match, which featured both his and Ramon's belts suspended above a ladder in the ring.<ref name=pwi92/><ref name="ladderbegin"/> This match was voted by fans as "Match of the Year" by ''[[Pro Wrestling Illustrated]]''.<ref name=stopper/> Over the next few months, Michaels battled various injuries and launched the ''[[WWE Raw#Recurring segments|Heartbreak Hotel]]'' television talk show segment, mainly shown on ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|WWF Superstars]]''.<ref>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=190}}</ref>

On August 28, 1994, Michaels and Diesel captured the WWF World Tag Team Championship from [[The Headshrinkers]] (Samu <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Samula Anoa'i]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> and Fatu <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Solofa Fatu]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>).<ref>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=195}}</ref> The next day, at [[SummerSlam (1994)|SummerSlam]], Diesel lost the Intercontinental championship to Ramon when Michaels accidentally superkicked Diesel.<ref name=pwi92/> This triggered a split between Michaels and Diesel, a storyline that was drawn out until [[Survivor Series (1994)|Survivor Series]] that November.<ref>{{cite news|title=2007 Wrestling Almanac & Book of Facts|work=Wrestling’s Historical Cards| publisher=Kappa Publishing|year=2007|pages=92–93}}</ref> Michaels went on to win the [[Royal Rumble (1995)|Royal Rumble]] in 1995,<ref name=sm196>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=196–199}}</ref> which set up a championship grudge match at [[WrestleMania XI]] against Diesel (who had gone on to win the WWF Championship from [[Bob Backland]]).<ref name=sm196/> As part of the storyline, Michaels recruited Sycho Sid ([[Sid Eudy]]) as his bodyguard for the build-up, lost the match,<ref>{{cite news|last=Martin|first=Finn|title=Power Slam Magazine, issue 10|work=Tough luck Shawn (WrestleMania XI)|publisher=SW Publishing|date=1995-04-24|pages=20–25}}</ref> and was attacked by Sid the following night.<ref name="Sid attack">{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=204}}</ref> After this, Michaels took time off,<ref name="Sid attack"/> because Vince McMahon wanted Michaels to become a crowd favorite.<ref>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=203-204}}</ref>

====Clique's influence (1995–1997)====
Michaels returned to the ring, as a crowd favorite, in June 1995. He went onto defeat [[Jeff Jarrett]] at the July pay-per-view event, [[In Your House 2: The Lumberjacks|In Your House]], to win his third Intercontinental championship.<ref name=stopper/><ref>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=209}}</ref> This led to a title defense against Razor Ramon at [[SummerSlam (1995)|SummerSlam]], in a ladder match, which Michaels won.<ref name=stopper/> Around this time, Michaels became the alleged leader of a backstage group known as [[The Kliq|The Clique]].<ref name=stopper/> Others perceived the group to have sufficient clout with WWF owner Vince McMahon, becoming dominant wrestling figures in WWF for several years in the mid-1990s. Michaels disputes the perception, saying that McMahon pushed only deserving wrestlers.<ref>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|pp=206&ndash;208}}</ref> Michaels' fan base was later nicknamed "The Kliq" as an inside reference to the real "Clique".<ref>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=230}}</ref> In October 1995, he was [[wiktionary:legitimate|legitimately]] attacked by several men outside a bar in [[Syracuse, New York]].<ref name="HAT"/> Shortly afterwards, at the [[In Your House#In Your House 4: Great White North|In Your House: Great White North]] pay-per-view, Michaels forfeited the Intercontinental championship to staged rival Dean Douglas ([[Shane Douglas|Troy Martin]]) because he was, according to WWF, unable to compete.<ref>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=213}}</ref> Later in the night, Douglas lost the championship to Clique member Razor Ramon.<ref>{{cite news|title=2007 Wrestling Almanac & Book of Facts|work=Wrestling’s Historical Cards|publisher=Kappa Publishing|year=2007| page=94}}</ref> The next month, during a match with [[Owen Hart]] on an episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'', Owen performed a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Enzuigiri|kick that struck the back of Michaels' head]].<ref name=sm215>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=215}}</ref> They continued the match, but Michaels collapsed in the ring, supposedly because he had suffered a concussion in the Syracuse incident.<ref name="HAT"/><ref name=sm215/> The concussion was scripted, which was kept from most fans at the time.<ref name="HAT"/> A retirement angle was written so that Michaels could take some time off, after he came back from an injury too soon.<ref name="HAT"/>

[[Image:Hug MSG Incident.jpg|thumb|left|165px|[[The Kliq#Curtain Call: The MSG Incident|The MSG Incident]].]]
After teasing a retirement, Michaels returned to WWF at the [[Royal Rumble (1996)|Royal Rumble]] match in 1996, which he wound up winning for a second year in a row, to receive a [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] match in the main event at [[WrestleMania XII]].<ref>{{cite news|title=2007 Wrestling Almanac & Book of Facts|work=Wrestling’s Historical Cards|publisher=Kappa Publishing|year=2007|page=95}}</ref> Around this time, Jose Lothario became Michaels on-screen manager.<ref>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=219}}</ref> At WrestleMania XII, Michaels defeated Bret Hart in the 'sudden death' overtime of their sixty minute [[Iron Man match]], a match where the winner is determined by the number of scoring conditions by a certain time limit, which had ended in a 0–0 tie.<ref name=stopper/> On May 19, 1996 in an incident known as "[[The Kliq#Curtain Call: The MSG Incident|Curtain Call: The MSG Incident]]," Michaels won a [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|steel cage match]], a match where the ring is surrounded by a steel cage, against Kevin Nash. After the match ended, Scott Hall, who was about to leave WWF to company rival WCW, came to the ring and hugged Michaels.<ref name=assael156>{{harv|Assael|Mooneyham|2002|p=156}}</ref> Although, Hunter Hearst Helmsley ([[Triple H|Paul Levesque]]) and Nash were seen as villains at the time, in contrast to Michaels and Hall, they were also members of The Clique, and group joined in the good-bye hug.<ref name=assael156/> The incident was seen as a rare breach in "[[kayfabe]]", which is the faux action and storylines that promoters wanted the fans to see as real.<ref name=assael156/> As WCW gained momentum due to the signings of Hall and Nash, Michaels held the championship for most of the year. Michaels' championship reign ended at the [[Survivor Series (1996)|1996 Survivor Series]] event, where he lost to Sycho Sid, his former bodyguard.<ref>{{Harv|Michaels|Feigenbaum|2005|p=234}}</ref> Michaels recaptured the championship from Sid in January 1997 at the [[Royal Rumble (1997)|Royal Rumble]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/304454115|title=HBK's second WWE title reign|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}</ref>

At the October pay-per-view event, [[WWE Bad Blood#1997|In Your House: Badd Blood]], Michaels and Undertaker participated in the first [[Hell in a Cell]] match, a match contested in a ring surrounded by a steel cage made of metal.

Michaels returned to the WWF on November 23, 1998, but not as a wrestler; instead, he replaced Sgt. Slaughter ([[Sgt.

Michaels made occasional appearances on WWF television as the commissioner during the spring and summer of 1999.
