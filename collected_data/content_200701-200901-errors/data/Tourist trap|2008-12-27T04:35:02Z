While the term may have negative connotations for some, such establishments may be viewed by tourists as fun and interesting diversions.  The term is somewhat ambiguous; the sort of tourist trap common in the US, for example, is slightly different from that found in Europe.{{Fact|date=December 2008}} 

==Tourist traps in the US==
As with elsewhere, tourist traps in the US provide an opportunity to separate a consumer from their [[money]] and are oriented primarily towards non-native or non-local consumers. But in the US, a tourist trap typically refers to a diversion from a genuine point of interest. Because the tourist is on his or her way to a particular attraction, the tourist trap will either offer a distinctly contrary experience or an allied experience.  They will offer up "unique" natural or artificial features (the "[[Biggest ball of twine|World's Largest Ball of Twine]]" or "[[Silver Springs Nature Theme Park|Silver Springs]]") that can only be had at the particular stop, and will then offer up conveniences or activities to entertain and capitalize upon the stopped tourist.

===Goods===
Typically goods available for purchase will include [[souvenir]]s and [[curiosities]] embossed with the name of the establishment and or local points of interest.  Additional products may include the normal range of items found in a [[gift shop]].

===Activities===
Activities at US tourist traps vary greatly based in part on the surrounding [[economy]] and [[infrastructure]]. In some areas like [[Ishpeming, Michigan]], [[Flush toilet]]s may be a sufficient draw to entice tourist to stop as they are not readily available at many tourist facilities in [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Michigan's Upper Peninsula]].<ref Name="Yoopers"/>  [[Wall Drug]], in [[South Dakota]], began its tourist trade simply by offering ice water.<ref Name="Wall">{{cite web  | title =WallDrug.com  | work =The Wall Drug Store got its start during the Depression years by offering Free Ice Water to thirsty travelers  | publisher =  | date =2007  | url =http://www.walldrug.com/  | format =web  | accessdate = 2008-02-04 }}</ref> In other locations like [[Anaheim, California]] more robust activates are required to draw a tourist to a specific activity over a [[Disneyland|competitor]]'s activity.  Other activities may include [[thematic restaurant]]s, [[arcade game]]s, [[wax museum]]s, [[collection]]s of unique artifacts, and so on.

Arriving in [[Flagstaff, Arizona]] where they took up [[Sheep#Domestication|sheep herding]].  Ralph visited the nearby [[Grand Canyon]] and realizing its potential as a tourist trap began acquiring properties.  Before the [[Grand Canyon]] became a [[U.S. National Monument|National Monument]] in 1906 the Cameron’s and accomplices had secured over 100 claims including some of the most scenic.   They improved an old Indian trail that would become [[Bright Angel Trail]] and began charging tourists a dollar toll.   Tourists could rent a [[mule]] to take them to the bottom of the canyon.  At the bottom of  the tourist would have an opportunity to be [[Sheep shearing|sheared]] again as they were given an opportunity to hire a mule to carry them to the top.  Other opportunities to separate tourists from their dollars included charging for [[Outhouse|comfort stations]].<ref>[http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/albright2/ Horace M.

===Size=== 
Tourist traps range significantly in size, from a single tree<ref>{{cite web  | coauthors = Jarl & Carol de Boer   | title = The Eternal Tree House in Redcrest on the Redwood Highway  | work = TUNNELTREE and CALIFPOSTCARD Home Pages  | publisher =   | date =  © 2003   | url = http://www.tunneltree.com/redwood/hum-scot/eternal/eternal.html  | format = Web  | doi =  | accessdate = 2007-03-21 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web  | coauthors = Jarl & Carol de Boer

===Stop and Shop===
A few establishments take pride in the term and embody it into their names, such as "Da Yoopers Tourist Trap"<ref Name="Yoopers">{{cite web   | title = Da Yoopers Tourist Trap & Museum  | work = Ishpeming, Michigan, Business web site  | url = http://www.dayoopers.com/thetrap.html  | format = Web   | accessdate = 2007-03-21 }}</ref> in [[Michigan]]’s [[Upper Peninsula]], and "The TOURIST TRAP"<ref name="Maryland">{{cite web   | title = The TOURIST TRAP  | work = Deep Creek Lake, Maryland, Business web site  | publisher =   | date = ©Copyright 2003 - The Tourist Trap  | url = http://www.shoptouristtrap.com  | format = Web  | doi =  | accessdate =  2007-03-21}}</ref> at [[Deep Creek Lake, Maryland]].  Other establishments like The "Trees of Mystery"<ref>{{cite web   | title = Trees of Mystery   | work = Klamath, California, Business web site   | publisher =  | date =  | url = http://www.treesofmystery.net   | format = Web  | doi =  | accessdate = 2007-03-21 }}</ref> in [[Klamath, California]] avoid the phrase.  If the term is embraced or not, regardless of the price of products, the two things that most tourist stops have in common are [[restroom]]s and items for sale with the name of the establishment or other nearby [[points of interest]].

European Tourist traps differ from the American variety in that they are typically based at, or very near, historical centres.{{Fact|date=December 2008}}

{{Trivia|date=October 2007}}
These kinds of attractions find their way into popular culture. A few examples, in addition to the [[Charles Ogden (children's writer)|Charles Ogden]] book and the [[Tourist Trap|horror film]] mentioned elsewhere on this page:
*In an episode of ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', in which the four main players are driving to California, they see a billboard advertising a Praline Pecans shop hundreds of miles away. As they approach its location, the signs appear with greater frequency, and their interest grows, only to learn on arrival that the store is out of business.
*An episode of ''[[Kojak]]'' titled "Tourist Trap" is about a crime boss conducting an [[illegal immigration]] scheme to provide workers for businesses he owns.
*In the 1983 film ''[[National Lampoon's Vacation]]'', Ellen Griswold ridicules her husband, Clark, for being distracted trying to find attractions such as "the world's largest ball of twine" on their way to their actual destination, the fictional amusement park called "Wally World".
*The [[Adventure Game]] [[Sam and Max Hit the Road]] largely takes place at a series of tourist traps across the United States.
*In the novel [[American Gods]] by [[Neil Gaiman]], tourist traps are hypothesized to be built in areas of great spiritual energy in America, much like shrines or stone monoliths might mark such spots in other parts of the world.
*Folk-music act [[Bright Eyes (band)|Bright Eyes]] has a song called ''Tourist Trap'' on their 2007 ''Four Winds EP.''
*In the 1996 independent movie [[Michael (1996 film)|''Michael'']], the archangel Michael insists on stopping at several tourist traps.
*In [[House of 1000 Corpses]] the group of young victims stop at Captain Spaulding's Museum of Monsters and Madmen, a hybrid tourist trap and gas station. 
* In the graphic novel ''[[The Hills Have Eyes: The Beginning]]'', the [[Mutants (The Hills Have Eyes)|mutants]] refer to their deal with gas station employees, who trick people into going into the mutants' domain where they are cannibalized, as a "tourist trap". <ref> ''The Hills Have Eyes: The Beginning'' </ref>
* [[RuneScape]] has a quest by this name.
* The 2006 Disney/Pixar animated movie ''[[Cars]]'' is set in the fictional community of Radiator Springs, Arizona, essentially a "tourist trap" of the old school along [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] as was bypassed when Interstate 40 supplanted Route 66, forcing the community into a state of decline.
