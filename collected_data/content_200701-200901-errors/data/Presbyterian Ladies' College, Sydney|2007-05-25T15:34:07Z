The college is a founding member of the [[Association of Heads of Independent Girls' Schools]] (AHIGS), and one of only two [[Round Square]] schools in Sydney.<ref name="RoundSquare">[http://www.plc.nsw.edu.au/public2/round_square.asp Round Square Application] (accessed:04-23-2007)</ref> 
P.L.C is non-selective, and caters for approximately 1400 girls from Branxton Reception (4 years old) to Year 12 (18 years old).

Set in Croydon, an [[Inner West (Sydney)|inner western]] suburb of Sydney, the grand buildings of the College stand within 5 hectares of historic grounds and fields. PLC is located within 15 minutes of the [[Sydney central business district|city's central business district]], [[Sydney University]], the [[University of Technology, Sydney|University of Technology]] and the [[Australian Catholic University]]. The [[Sydney Olympic Park|Homebush Olympic site]] is 10 minutes away to the west of the College.<ref name="AboutPLC"/>

The current principal is Dr. William T. McKeith who has led the school since [[1986]].<ref name="Principal">[http://www.plc.nsw.edu.au/public2/the_principal.asp PLC Website- The Principal] (accessed:04-23-2007)</ref>

== History ==
The Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney was the first Presbyterian school established in New South Wales. The school was founded as '''The Presbyterian Ladies' College, Ashfield''', with 39 girls, on the 7th of January, [[1888]], at "Fernlea", a fourteen-roomed gentleman's residence in [[Ashfield, New South Wales|Ashfield]], the current site of the Masonic Hospital. This establishment saw the culmination of five years' work by a committee of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church of N.S.W.<ref name="Golden Hope"/> 

The decision to commence a Ladies' College was made in [[1883]] when the Assembly formed a special committee to investigate the establishment of Superior [[Boarding school|Boarding Schools]] for girls and boys. By July [[1887]], the committee had purchased the Ashfield property and advertised far and wide for an appropriate principal. They unanimously selected [[John Marden|Dr. John Marden]], a science master from the [[Methodist Ladies' College, Melbourne|Methodist Ladies' College]] in [[Melbourne]], ''"because of his high academic standing, his experience and success in teaching and his high Christian character"''.<ref name="Golden Hope">{{cite book | author=McFarlane, John | title=The Golden Hope: Presbyterian Ladies' College, 1888-1988 | publisher=P.L.C Council, Presbyterian Ladies' College Sydney, (Croydon) | year=1988 | id= ISBN 0-9597340-1-5}}</ref>
[[Image:PLC1891.jpg|frame|First students at Croydon|right|260px]]

By August [[1888]], the College had outgrown the Ashfield site, which had always been considered a temporary home for the college, and Council began discussing alternative sites at Croydon. On the 5th September [[1889]], Col. John Hay Goodlet told the council of "Shubra Hall", the home of [[Anthony Horderns|Anthony Hordern III]] at Croydon, and urged Council to purchase it. Subsequently, the property was purchased on the 26th October for £7,500. Plans were promptly drawn up for the additional buildings required, and by the beginning of the school year of [[1891]], the new site was complete and ready to commence furnishing as the permanent home of P.L.C. The move saw the college change its name to '''The Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney'''.<ref name="Golden Hope"/>
The "Presbyterian" reported of the opening of the College on the 10th of March, by the new [[Governor of New South Wales|Governor of N.S.W.]], the [[Victor Child-Villiers, 7th Earl of Jersey|Rt. Hon. Victor Albert George, Earl of Jersey]] at its new site: 

<blockquote>
Standing in six acres of ground, laid out in lawn tennis courts, gardens, etc., in an elevated position, it forms, with its tower 84ft high, a very conspicuous feature in the landscape. The central feature of the building is the tower, and the architectural design of the facade is classic. Altogether the effect is very imposing.

On the ground floor of the main building is a handsome hall, the dining room capable of seating 80 persons, and the school-room. This room is lighted by three large bay windows of cathedral glass, with stained panels at boarders. At the end of the school hall is a spacious corridor, communicating with six classrooms. These are lofty, well lighted, and ventilated in the most approved fashion. Close to the classrooms are two lavatories, fitted with every convenience and sanitary appliance.

At the side and rear of the main building are five music rooms, handsome landing, and wide corridors, extending the whole length of the building, giving access to 27 spacious dormitories. The bed furniture is of the simplest and most wholesome description - none but spring wire mattresses are used, with light horsehair mattresses only 2 inches thick above. With this arrangement the maximum of cleanliness and comfort combined is secured.

There are six bathrooms, linen rooms, etc. The baths are fitted with shower, hot and cold water pipes and can be filled in three minutes. The lavatory and bathroom fittings are especially good, marble and electro-plate being freely used.
[[Image:Shubrahall.jpg|frame|Shubra Hall|right|260px]]

Many of the internal doors are of stained glass from the establishment of Messrs. Goodlet & Smith. The main staircase window is a work of art well worth seeing. The central window is beautifully designed, and contains two female figures representing Literature and Music.

Among the portraits on the two side windows are those of [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Titian]] and [[John Milton]]. Some of the mantelpieces are exquisite in workmanship, those in the dining hall being wrought in Italian Gariotte Marble. The ceilings are handsomely decorated in chaste colours, relieved with stencil flowers and gold mouldings. Every ceiling in the place is sound-proof.

At the very rear of the main building is a gymnasium and studio fitted with every modern appliance. It may be mentioned that very special provision is made for the safety of the building and of the inmates in case of fire."<ref name="Golden Hope"/>
</blockquote> 

The opening of the new buildings received wide publicity in the papers of March [[1891]]. This was principally due to an impromptu speech made by the Countess of Jersey, Margaret Child-Villiers, of which was considered a controversial and ground-breaking move, as it was most unusual for women to speak in public. Encouraged by her husband, the Countess spoke of the opportunities available to girls at the college, the future role of Australian women, and the need for life-long learning.<ref>The Ex-students Union News, Number 75 (2006). </ref> P.L.C's 'Jersey Day', an annual event where ex-students return to the college on the Sunday closest to the 10th of March, is named in the Countesses honour.

By [[1902]], space had again become a problem due to increasing enrolments. Marden urged that new classrooms be built, which Council reluctantly agreed to. These buildings comprising six classrooms downstairs and eighteen rooms upstairs, were finished and handed over by the contractor on 6th October, [[1904]], at a cost of £2,000. This increase in enrolments also convinced Council of the need to set up a branch school on another site, preferably on the [[North Shore (Sydney)|North Shore]]. A committee was set up in June [[1907]] to study the feasibility of a second school, yet recommendations were not considered by the Council. By [[1913]], space at the college was at an absolute premium. Marden reported that many applications were being refused because of ''"shortness of space".'' This matter was taken to the [[General Assembly (presbyterian church)|General Assembly]] of [[1913]], resulting in the approval of the establishment of a branch at [[Pymble, New South Wales|Pymble]] under the Council of P.L.C Sydney. The Council was given £5,000 to erect new buildings and lay out the grounds. "The [[Presbyterian Ladies' College, Pymble]]" was opened on the 8th February, [[1916]] with 48 day girls and 86 boarders.<ref name="Golden Hope"/>
This school is still in existence, and is now known as '[[Pymble Ladies' College]]'. The opening of the Pymble campus once again necessitated a change of name for the Croydon college, from 'The Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney' to '''The Presbyterian Ladies' College, Croydon'''.<ref name="Golden Hope"/> 
The 'Presbyterian Ladies' College, Beecroft' was established in [[1924]], a primary 'feeder' school for the Croydon College, however it did not receive adequate attention from college council and was forced to close in [[1929]]. This school reopened shortly after under new management, and is now known as '[[Arden Anglican School]]'.<ref name="Golden Hope"/> 

[[1942]] saw major upheaval and difficulties for the college. The new principal, Dr. Helen Wilkie, arrived to find falling enrolments, staffing problems and food shortages due to the effects of the raging [[World War II]].<ref name="Golden Hope"/> The situation was made much worse as word was received that [[Australian military]] authorities wished to inspect the school with a view to taking it over. On the 24th of March, 1942, it was requested that the school be occupied by the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] for the purpose of establishing a top secret [[Radar|Radar Unit]]. As a result, council approached [[Meriden, Strathfield|Meriden School]] in [[Strathfield, New South Wales|Strathfield]] to see if P.L.C could be accommodated there. Meriden kindly agreed to house the P.L.C boarders and to accommodate [[singing]], [[domestic science]], and [[physical education]] classes.<ref name="Golden Hope"/>
Further, the school purchased "Lingwood", a property in Strathfield, as a centre for the schools remaining activities.
In spite of the apparent happy association with Meriden, Dr. Wilkie, recommended that further integration with the school should not proceed, and thus at the end of 1924, Meriden indicated that they would no longer house the P.L.C boarders.<ref name="Golden Hope"/>

From here, P.L.C moved to 'Lauriston' (now the primary school of [[Santa Sabina College]]) and 'Welbeck', on The Boulevarde at Strathfield. In July, [[1944]], the owners of 'Lingwood' asked if the school was interested in buying the property. Council agreed to the purchase in order to use the house as a kindergarten 'feeder school' for the college, or as a site for a permanent move to Strathfield. A few months later, Council decided that the future of P.L.C lay in Strathfield and not in Croydon, and offered the Croydon campus to the military for £36,500. Plans were subsequently drawn up to purchase "Welbeck" and "Lauriston" to form the new P.L.C.<ref name="Golden Hope"/> 

Council's wish for the school to stay in Strathfield was not shared by most, with one student writing:

<blockquote>
"I must go back to Croydon again, to the old grey tower and walls;

And all I ask is the rising bell as it peels its lusty call;

And the beds creak, and the blankets fly, and the cheerful faces beaming;

And a mad rush to get a bath, and the bath taps steaming.

I must go back to Croydon again, for the call of the old school bell;

Is a loud call, a clear call, and a call that I know well;

And all I ask is a windy day with the old flag flying;

The chatter of cheerful voices, and the flag staff flying.

I must go back to Croydon again, to that dear old school of ours;

Where on the courts and in the pool I've spent many happy hours;

And all I ask is the old school song as we stand in the dear old hall;

And I pray that some day we may return to that dearest school of all". - Peggy Levy.<ref>Aurora Australis, Page 3 (1942).</ref>
</blockquote> 

In [[1945]], after intervention by the Education Trust of the N.S.W General Assembly, which had been investigating the future of the college, Council decided that the Strathfield proposal was not viable. It was agreed that P.L.C would reopen at Croydon in first term, [[1946]]. The military agreed to pay for the extensive renovations that were needed. The 'Lingwood' property was retained as a preparatory school for the college, and renamed 'Branxton'.{{Ref_label|a|a|none}}<ref name="Golden Hope"/>

Legacies of P.L.C's war-time occupation remain, with tunnels and [[bomb shelter]]s accessible from below the [[stage]] of 'College Hall'. A plaque presented to the school by the RAAF in commemoration of P.L.C's war-time involvement, may be found at the entrance to the main school, on the school [[Verandah]].

P.L.C's final name change occurred in [[1977]] due to the Pymble college's split from the Presbyterian Church, and its subsequent change of name to 'Pymble Ladies' College'. It was decided that the school should return to its originally intended name of 'The Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney'.

The school motto was adopted on 23 August [[1888]]. It was decided that the motto should be ''"sancte sapienter".'' No translation was given of the Latin, but a rather loose translation is: "be holy wisely" or "holy, wisely". The motto encapsulates the two broad aims of the school religious and academic education.<ref name="Golden Hope"/>

== College crest ==   
The school crest was adopted at a College Council meeting on 23 August [[1888]]. It now forms the badge worn on the [[uniform]]. The College Council decided to use the same crest as that used by the [[Presbyterian Church of New South Wales]], but with minor modifications.<ref name="Golden Hope"/> 
  
The Church's crest consisted of a shield with the words "nectamen consumebatur" surrounding it. A [[burning bush]], the stars of the [[Southern Cross]] and a [[Latin cross]], in outline, were on the shield. At the base, rather indefinitely, were the floral emblems of [[Scotland]], [[England]] and [[Ireland]], with only the [[thistle]] and [[rose]] clearly defined. Surrounding the shield was a border with the words "Presbyterian Church of New South Wales". At the top of the border was the [[Star of David]]. Behind both shield and borders was the [[Saint Andrew's Cross|cross of St. Andrew]] in blue.<ref name="Golden Hope"/> 
[[Image:PLCtiles.jpg|frame|Verandah tiles|right|260px]]     
The School modified the crest by changing the words "Presbyterian Church of New South Wales" to "Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney" and substituting the School motto "sancte sapienter" for "nec tamen consumebatur". A [[Maltese cross]] device was placed at the top of the shield.<ref name="Golden Hope"/> 

At [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] in [[1901]], Presbyterian churches of the various Australian states also federated. The newly formed [[Presbyterian Church of Australia]] adopted as its crest the NSW crest, changing "[[New South Wales]]" to "[[Australia]]". In [[1939]] the General Assembly of Australia adopted a new crest: the star of David disappeared, the [[Latin cross]] was added and the floral emblems were redrawn with the thistle in centre position. These changes of [[1939]] account for the differences between the school's crest and the Church's crest today.<ref name="Golden Hope"/> 
   
The school's crest can be found in the tiles on the verandah outside the main door, near the College Hall. Traditionally, the school's crest has been produced in the school colours, red and white.<ref name="Golden Hope"/>

== School badge ==   
The school's highly symbolic badge was inspired by the first principal, [[John Marden|Dr. Marden]] and designed by the first art teacher, Mr. J.A. Bennett in 1888. The [[maiden]] on the [[lion]] (Knowledge) crowned with a [[tower]] (The Home) and holding a [[trident]] (Sovereignty) and a [[laurel wreath]] (Victory) represents the victory of true womanhood, whose crown is the home, over force. The sun symbolises light and vitalising energy while the crescent moon stands for youth. The words "Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney" surround the badge.<ref name="Golden Hope"/> 
[[Image:PLCBadge.jpg|right|thumb|150px|PLC Sydney school badge]]
The motto "All'ultimo lavoro" comes from [[Dante]] and has variously been translated as: "for the crowning task", "strive for the highest", "the utmost for the highest", or "I work for the highest".<ref name="Golden Hope"/>   
   
"Croydon" replaced "Sydney" on the badge when the Pymble branch became a separate school. In [[1977]] the Pymble College was awarded to the [[Uniting Church]] after Church Union and became known as "[[Pymble Ladies' College]]". Subsequently, in [[1978]] P.L.C changed the wording on the badge from "Croydon" back to "Sydney".<ref name="Golden Hope"/>    
    
The badge is reproduced in the [[leadlight]] over the front door of the original house, 'Shubra Hall'.<ref name="Golden Hope"/>
It may also be found on the recently opened 'ex-students pathway'.   
   
The school badge was traditionally worn as part of the uniform on the original [[tam-o-shanter]], until it was phased out in [[1995]]. The badge is currently not worn by students, partially due to its adoption by Pymble Ladies' College as their school crest in 1977. It was however reintroduced in [[2003]] as an addition to the Berets of the 'P.L.C Pipes and Drums' uniform.
The badge is also used by the college's ex-student's union as it has since [[1905]], with the addition of the words "Ex-students Union" below.

== College tartan ==   
The school has adopted as its school and [[Pipe band|Pipes and Drums]] uniform the [[Black Watch]] Tartan of the [[Royal Highland Regiment]]. P.L.C was granted permission to wear the tartan after its brother school, [[The Scots College]], were issued a [[royal decree]] allowing them to use Black Watch as their Pipes & Drums and [[Cadets]] uniform.   
  
NB: "the tartan of the Black Watch, the oldest of the highland regiments. This tartan was specially designed for the regiment to prevent the jealousy which would have been aroused, if any existing clan tartan had been used".<ref>Aurora Australis(1958).</ref>

When the college first opened in [[1888]], there was no uniform, rather the girls wore long cotton dresses, gloves and hat. The early [[20th century]] saw the introduction of a straw [[boater]], worn with a red and white hat band featuring the college crest with its 'burning bush' woven into it in red. [[Prefects]] during this time wore red silk arm-bands embroidered with a gold crest.<ref name="Golden Hope"/> 

[[1910]] saw the straw boater changed to a large [[breton]] shape.

The distinctive Black Watch Tartan of the college was introduced in [[1918]]. Senior girls wore heavy box-pleated skirts and white blouses, whilst junior girls wore pinafore dresses. All girls wore a navy blazer and heavy woollen stockings. The tennis uniform consisted of a white dress, white stockings, and a cream blazer piped with red braid and embroidered pockets.
Prefects at the time also wore a special hat badge with a ring of bright blue enamel. A black felt [[Breton]] was introduced for winter use, and no change was made until the introduction of the green beret in [[1952]].<ref name="Golden Hope"/> 

The first summer uniform, consisting of a light weight [[gingham]] dress, was introduced in [[1949]]. This uniform was replaced by a [[terylene]] mixture in [[1967]].

A grey sports uniform was introduced in [[1951]], and was later changed to red, white and black. Prior to this, girls were required to wear a navy box pleated [[tunic]], with a long sleeved blouse and tie. House badges were worn on the left shoulder.<ref name="Golden Hope"/> 

[[1966]] saw the introduction of the current senior uniform for years 11 and 12. This uniform was designed by the senior students of [[1965]] and consists of a Black Watch Tartan kilt, white blouse (short sleeve in summer, long in winter), a dark green collarless blazer, green jumper or vest, black stockings for winter and bottle green knee-high socks for summer and black leather lace-up shoes. Girls of [[Scotland|Scottish]] origin are permitted to wear the [[kilt pin]] representing their family name, rather than the standard school pin. A bottle green and Black Watch [[tam-o-shanter]] (known as 'the [[Beret]]') was also introduced for all grades a few years earlier.<ref name="Golden Hope"/> 

[[1995]] saw the phasing out of 'the Beret' as girls found it very difficult to wear. This was replaced by the current '[[Panama hat]]' which is worn by all girls in the junior school, and is optional for the high school girls. The Beret was however reintroduced (this time in navy) in [[2003]] as an addition to the 'P.L.C [[Pipes and Drums]]' uniform.

The current junior (R-10) uniform was introduced in [[1997]]. In [[summer]], girls are required to wear a Black Watch Tartan tunic, a short-sleeve white blouse, bottle green blazer with tartan piping and crest, short bottle green socks and black leather shoes. The [[winter]] uniform consists of the Black Watch Tartan tunic, a long-sleeve white blouse, the bottle green blazer, bottle green jumper or vest, Black Watch Tartan tie, Black Watch Tartan [[scarf]] and either green knee-high socks or black stockings.
All girls are required to use regulation green crested school and sports bags, and must wear their school and house badges at all times.
Black or Black Watch Tartan ribbons may be worn.

School 'pockets' are awarded for achievements in a wide range of areas, and are embroidered in red on the pockets of junior blazers (R-10 girls), and white on the left-side of senior blazers (11-12 girls).

Green and Gold striped blazers are awarded to girls who represent Australia in any event. Approximately six current students have been awarded these blazers.

== House system ==
The College currently has six [[House system|'Houses']] and all students and staff take active part in House activities.

The house system was established by [[John Marden|Dr. John Marden]] shortly after the opening of the school, and consisted of three houses: 'East', 'West' and 'Boarders'. In [[1924]], the senior houses were re-organised, and renamed 'Kinross', 'Harper' and 'Ferguson' (with 'Anderson' added in [[1968]]), and in [[1926]], the junior houses were named 'Vicars' and '[[Ewen Neil McQueen|McQueen]]' (with 'Thompson' added in [[1937]]).<ref name="Golden Hope"/>  
[[1979]] saw the school move to four houses from primary to secondary, and thus the junior houses 'Vicars', McQueen' and 'Thompson' disappeared.<ref name="Golden Hope"/> 
Finally, [[1995]] saw the introduction of two new houses due to increasing enrolments. These were named 'Pickard' and 'Wilkie'.

The Houses are named after women and men who have made an outstanding contribution to the life of the College.

== The P.L.C Armidale/P.L.C Sydney Alliance ==

In late August [[2005]], due to financial troubles at the [[Presbyterian Ladies' College, Armidale]], it was announced that P.L.C Armidale and P.L.C Sydney would join together to form an 'alliance'. It is hoped that this alliance will strengthen P.L.C Armidale through cooperative marketing, a change in management and a stronger financial base. It should also be of benefit to both schools through student exchanges, accommodation for sporting events or excursions, and a 'country or city' option for prospective students.

In the September-October 2005 edition of the Presbyterian Church in New South Wales's 'Church Offices Newsletter', the Chairman of Trustees, Jeof Falls, announced this alliance between the two schools:

<blockquote>
Arising from a detailed strategic analysis of the school over the past six months and recommendations from some highly respected educational consultants, the Church has moved to strengthen PLC Armidale through modifying its governance structure so as to bring it under the executive leadership of...Dr William McKeith, who is the Principal of PLC Sydney.

This action was endorsed by the General Assembly in July. Members of the present PLC Armidale Council will form part of the new Council. Essentially, PLC Armidale and PLC Sydney will become true sister schools under the leadership of a united Council and an Executive Principal. PLC Armidale will also continue to have its own Head of School.

Both schools will retain their strong sense of independence, and will maintain their separate identities so as to recognise and preserve the unique relationships, histories and traditions that both have developed over many years in serving their respective communities. Dr McKeith’s appointment as Executive Principal of both schools is effective from 1st September 2005.<ref>Presbyterian Church in New South Wales, Church Offices Newsletter (2005).
