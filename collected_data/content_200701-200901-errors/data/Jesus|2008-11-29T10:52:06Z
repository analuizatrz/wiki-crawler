[[Christian views of Jesus]] (see also [[Christology]]) center on the belief that Jesus is [[Christology|divine]], is the [[Christ|Messiah]] whose coming was [[Claimed Messianic prophecies of Jesus|prophesied in the Old Testament]], and that he was [[Death and resurrection of Jesus|resurrected]] after his crucifixion. Christians predominantly believe that Jesus is the "[[Son of God]]" (generally meaning that he is [[God the Son]], the second person in the [[Trinity]]), who came to provide [[Salvation#Christianity|salvation]] and [[Confession|reconciliation]] with [[God]] by his death for their [[Sin#Christian views of sin|sin]]s. Other Christian beliefs include Jesus' [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]], performance of [[Miracles attributed to Jesus|miracles]], [[Ascension of Jesus|ascension]] into [[Heaven]], and future [[Second Coming]]. While the doctrine of the Trinity is widely accepted by Christians, a small minority instead hold various [[Nontrinitarianism|nontrinitarian]] beliefs concerning the divinity of Jesus.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Antitrinitarianism|url=http://www.gameo.org/encyclopedia/contents/A597.html|last=Friedmann|first=Robert|year=1953|encyclopedia=Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online|publisher=Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online|accessdate=2008-06-08}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name “Jesus” is an [[Anglicisation]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{Polytonic|Ἰησοῦς}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|Iēsoûs}}''), itself a [[Hellenisation]] of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] {{lang|he|יהושע}} (''Yehoshua'') or Hebrew-[[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] {{lang|he|ישוע}} (''[[Yeshua (name)|Yeshua]]''), meaning “[[Tetragrammaton|YHWH]] rescues”. “[[Christ]]” is a title derived from the Greek {{Polytonic|Χριστός}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|Christós}}''), meaning the “Anointed One”, which corresponds to the Hebrew-derived “[[Messiah]]”.<ref>per ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'' [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374x.htm]</ref> Another common name for Jesus, '''Emmanuel''' or '''Immanuel''' is derived from the Aramaic "Imman-el", which translates as "God with us".

== Chronology ==
{{main|Chronology of Jesus}}
Scholars do not know the exact year or date of Jesus' birth or death. The [[Gospel of Matthew]] and the [[Gospel of Luke]] place Jesus' birth under the reign of [[Herod the Great]], who died in 4 BC/BCE,<ref>Edwin D. Freed, ''Stories of Jesus' Birth'', (Continuum International, 2004), page 119.</ref> although the Gospel of Luke also describes the birth as taking place during the [[Census of Quirinius|first census]] of the Roman provinces of [[History of Syria#Syria in antiquity|Syria]] and [[Iudaea Province|Iudaea]] in 6 AD/CE.<ref>Geza Vermes, ''The Nativity: History and Legend'', London, Penguin, 2006, page 22.</ref> Scholars generally assume a date of birth between 6 and 4 BC/BCE.<ref>James D. G. Dunn, Jesus Remembered, Eerdmans Publishing (2003), page 324.</ref> Due to a fourth century arrangement to offset the pagan Roman [[Saturnalia]] festival, the birth of Jesus is celebrated on [[December 25]]. Since the thirteenth century, celebration of the [[Christmas]] ("Christ's Mass") has become an important Christian tradition.<ref name="HC13">Howard Clarke, The Gospel of Matthew and its readers, Indiana University Press, p.13</ref> The common Western standard for numbering years, in which the current year is {{CURRENTYEAR}}, is based on an early medieval attempt to count the years from Jesus' birth.

Jesus' ministry followed that of [[John the Baptist]].<ref>Luke states that John's ministry began in the fifteenth year of the reign of [[Tiberius Caesar]], when [[Pontius Pilate]] was governor of [[Judea]], and [[Herod]] was [[tetrarch]] of [[Galilee]], and his brother Philip was tetrarch of the region of [[Iturea]] and [[Trachonitis]], and [[Lysanias]] was tetrarch of [[Abilene]], during the [[high priesthood]] of [[Annas]] and [[Caiaphas]].</ref> The Gospels, [[Josephus]], and [[Tacitus]] name Pontius Pilate as the Roman prefect who had Jesus crucified, and Pilate was prefect of Judea between 26 and 36 AD/CE.<ref>Joel B. Green, The Gospel of Luke, (Eerdmans, 1997), page 168.</ref> According to Matthew, Mark and Luke, Jesus was executed after [[Passover]] (a Jewish holiday occurring in northern spring) but according to John he was executed earlier in the day of preparation for the passover.<ref> Amy-Jill Levine, The Oxford Dictionary of the Biblical World, Oxford University Press, p.373</ref> Most Christians commemorate Jesus' crucifixion on [[Good Friday]] and celebrate his resurrection on [[Easter]] Sunday.

== Life and teachings, as told in the Gospels ==
{{main|New Testament view on Jesus' life}}

The [[Bible]]'s four [[biblical canon|canonical]] [[gospel]]s are the principal sources for the traditional [[Christian]] biography of Jesus' life. Scholars, although considering the gospel accounts to be [[historical method|historically useful]], differ widely as to their reliability. 

The Gospels (especially Matthew) present Jesus' birth, life, death, and resurrection as fulfillments of [[Messianic prophecy in Christianity|prophecies found in the Hebrew Bible]]. See, for example, the [[virgin birth]], the [[flight into Egypt]], Immanuel ([[Isaiah 7:14]]), and the [[suffering servant]].<ref name="Christianity.com">{{cite web|url=http://Christianity.com/Christian%20Foundations/Jesus/11541169/|title="What the Old Testament Prophesied About the Messiah"|accessdate=2007-10-11}}</ref>

=== Genealogy and family ===
{{main|Genealogy of Jesus|Desposyni|Jesus bloodline}}
[[Image:Czestochowska.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Jesus and Mary: [[Black Madonna of Częstochowa]]]]
Of the four gospels, only Matthew<ref>{{niv|Matthew|1:1-17|Matthew 1:1-17}}</ref> and Luke<ref>{{niv|Luke|3:23-38|Luke 3:23-38}}</ref> give accounts of Jesus' genealogy. The accounts in the two gospels are substantially different.<ref>Joseph A. Fitzmyer, The Gospel According to Luke I-IX. Anchor Bible. Garden City: Doubleday, 1981, pp. 499–500; I. Howard Marshall, The Gospel of Luke (The New International Greek Testament Commentary). Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1978, p. 158;</ref> The genealogies cannot be harmonized and contemporary scholars generally view the genealogies as theological constructs. More specifically, some have suggested that Matthew wants to underscore birth of a messianic child of royal lineage (mentioning Solomon) whereas Luke's genealogy is priestly (mentioning Levi).<ref>[[Howard W. Clarke]], The Gospel of Matthew and Its Readers, [[Indiana University Press]], 2003, p.1</ref> Both accounts trace his line back to [[David|King David]] and from there to [[Abraham]]. These lists are identical between Abraham and David, but they differ between David and Joseph. Matthew starts with [[Solomon]] and proceeds through the kings of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] to the last king, [[Jeconiah]]. After Jeconiah, the line of kings terminated when [[Babylonian captivity|Babylon conquered Judah]]. Thus, Matthew shows Jesus as a descendant of the kings of [[Land of Israel|Israel]]. Luke's genealogy is longer than Matthew's; it goes back to [[Adam and Eve|Adam]] and provides more names between David and Jesus.

<!-- The way Joseph's fatherhood is not expressed or expressed is the result of a long discussion attain consensus. Please do not change without reading and discussion. -->
[[Saint Joseph|Joseph]], husband of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], appears in descriptions of Jesus' childhood. No mention, however, is made of Joseph during the ministry of Jesus.

The New Testament books of Matthew, Mark, and [[Galatians]] tell of Jesus' relatives, including what may have been brothers and sisters.<ref>{{niv|Matthew|13:55–56|Matthew 13:55–56}}, {{niv|Mark|6:3|Mark 6:3}}, and {{niv|Galatians|1:19|Galatians 1:19}}</ref> The Greek word ''adelphos'' in these verses, often translated as ''brother'', can refer to any familial relation, and most Catholics and Eastern Orthodox Christians translate the word as ''kinsman'' or ''cousin'' in this context (see [[Perpetual virginity of Mary]]). Luke also mentions that [[Elizabeth (Biblical person)|Elizabeth]], mother of John the Baptist, was a "cousin" or "relative" of Mary ({{niv|Luke|1:36|Luke 1:36}}), which would make John a distant cousin of Jesus.

=== Nativity and early life ===
{{main|Annunciation|Nativity of Jesus|Child Jesus}}
[[Image:Gerard van Honthorst 002.jpg|thumb|left|165px|''Adoration of the Shepherds'', [[Gerard van Honthorst]], 17th century]]
According to Matthew and Luke, Jesus was born in [[Bethlehem]] of [[Judea]] to Mary, a virgin, by a miracle of the [[Holy Spirit]]. The Gospel of Luke gives an account of the [[angel]] [[Gabriel]] visiting Mary to tell her that she was chosen to bear the [[Son of God]] ({{niv|Luke|1:26–38|Luke 1:26–38}}). According to Luke, an order of [[Augustus|Caesar Augustus]] had forced Mary and Joseph to leave their homes in [[Nazareth]] and come to the home of Joseph's ancestors, the house of [[David]], for the [[Census of Quirinius]].

After Jesus' birth, the couple was forced to use a [[manger]] in place of a crib because of a shortage of accommodation ({{niv|Luke|2:1–7|Luke 2:1–7}}). According to Luke, an angel announced Jesus' birth to shepherds who left their flocks to see the newborn child and who subsequently publicized what they had witnessed throughout the area (see [[The First Noël]]). Matthew tells of the "[[Biblical Magi|Wise Men]]" or "[[Magi]]" who brought gifts to the infant Jesus after following a star which they believed was a sign that the [[King of the Jews]] had been born ({{niv|Matthew|2:1–12|Matthew 2:1–12}}). King Herod hears of Jesus' birth from the Wise Men and tries to kill him by massacring all the male children in Bethlehem under the age of two (the "[[massacre of the innocents]]").<ref name ="Harris Matthew">[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985. "Matthew" p. 272-285</ref> The family flees to Egypt and remains there until Herod's death, whereupon they settle in Nazareth to avoid living under the authority of Herod's son and successor [[Herod Archelaus|Archelaus]] ({{niv|Matthew|2:19–23|Matthew 2:19–23}}).

Jesus' childhood home is identified as the town of Nazareth in [[Galilee]]. Except for Matthew's "flight into Egypt," and a short trip to [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Sidon]] (in what is now Lebanon), the Gospels place all other events in Jesus' life in [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|ancient Israel]].<ref>''For Egypt'': {{niv|Matthew|2:13–23|Matthew 2:13–23}}; ''For Tyre and sometimes Sidon'':{{niv|Matthew|15:21–28|Matthew 15:21–28}} and {{niv|Mark|7:24–30|Mark 7:24–3}}</ref>
[[Image:Bogojavlenie.jpg|thumb|175px|right|[[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism of Christ]] (ortodox icon)]]

Only Luke tells that Jesus was found teaching in the temple by his parents after being lost. The [[Finding in the Temple]] ({{niv|Luke|2:41–52|Luke 2:41–52}}) is the only event between Jesus' infancy and baptism mentioned in any of the canonical Gospels, however [[List of gospels#infancy gospels|infancy gospels]] were popular in antiquity. According to Luke, Jesus was "about thirty years of age" when he was baptized ({{niv|Luke|3:23|Luke 3:23}}). In Mark, Jesus is called a [[carpenter]]. Matthew says he was a carpenter's son, however, the Greek word used in the Gospel is "tekton" meaning "builder," which suggests he could have been an artisan of some type as well.({{niv|Mark|6:3|Mark 6:3}}, {{niv|Matthew|13:55|Matthew 13:55}}).

=== Baptism and Temptation ===
{{main|Baptism of Jesus|Temptation of Jesus|John the Baptist}}
All three [[synoptic Gospels]] describe the [[Baptism of Jesus]] by [[John the Baptist]], an event which Biblical scholars describe as the beginning of Jesus' public ministry. According to these accounts, Jesus came to the [[Jordan River]] where John the Baptist had been preaching and baptizing people in the crowd. After Jesus was baptized and rose from the water, Mark states Jesus "saw the heavens parting and the Spirit descending upon Him like a dove. Then a voice came from heaven saying: 'You are My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased'" ({{nkjv|Mark|1:10–11|Mark 1:10–11}}). 
[[Image:Ary Scheffer - The Temptation of Christ (1854).jpg|thumb|right|175px|''Temptation of Christ'', [[Ary Scheffer]], 19th c.]]
Mark starts his narration with Jesus' baptism, specifying that it is a token of repentance and for forgiveness of sins.<ref name ="Harris">[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985.</ref> Why Jesus would need forgiveness of sins has long been a puzzle to the Church, and Matthew omits this reference, emphasizing Jesus' superiority to John.<ref name ="Harris">[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985.</ref><ref>Early Christian accounts reflect some perplexity at Jesus being baptized, especially by a subordinate figure. See "Baptism of Christ." Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005</ref> Matthew describes John as initially hesitant to comply with Jesus' request for John to baptize him, stating that it was Jesus who should baptize him. Jesus persisted, "It is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness" ({{niv|Matthew|3:15|Matthew 3:15}}). In Matthew, God's public dedication informs the reader that Jesus has become God's anointed ("Christ").<ref name ="Harris">[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985.</ref> 

Following his baptism, Jesus was led into the desert by God where he [[fasting|fasted]] for forty days and forty nights ({{niv|Matthew|4:1–2|Matthew 4:1–2}}). During this time, the [[Devil in Christianity|devil]] appeared to him and tempted Jesus three times. Each time, Jesus refused temptation with a quotation of [[scripture]] from the [[Book of Deuteronomy]]. The devil departed and angels came and brought nourishment to Jesus ({{niv|Matthew|4:1–11|Matthew 4:1–11}}, {{niv|Mark|1:12–13|Mark 1:12–13}}, {{niv|Luke|4:1–13|Luke 4:1–13}}).

The Gospel of John does not describe Jesus' baptism, but it does attest that Jesus is the very one about whom John had been preaching — the Son of God. The Baptist twice declares Jesus to be the Lamb of God, a term found nowhere else in the Gospels. John also emphasizes Jesus' superiority over John.<ref name ="Harris">[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985.</ref> John doesn't record Jesus' temptation in the wilderness. In John, Jesus leads a program of baptism in Judea, and his disciples baptize more people than John ({{niv|John|3:22-23|John 3:22-23}}, {{niv|John|4:1-3|John 4:1-3}}).

=== Ministry ===
{{main|Ministry of Jesus|Sermon on the Mount|Sermon on the Plain|Twelve Apostles|Transfiguration of Jesus}}
Mark says that Jesus came to "give his life as a ransom for many," <ref>{{niv|Mark|10:45|Mark 10:45}}</ref> Luke that he was sent to "preach the good news of the [[Kingdom of God]],"<ref>{{niv|Luke|4:43|Luke 4:43}}</ref>, and John that he came so that those who believed in him would have eternal life.<ref>{{niv|John|20:31|John 20:31}}.</ref> Over the course of his ministry, Jesus is said to have [[Miracles of Jesus|performed various miracles]], including healings, [[exorcism]]s, [[walking on water]], [[turning water into wine]], and raising several people, such as [[Lazarus]], from the dead ({{niv|John|11:1–44|John 11:1–44}}, {{niv|Matthew|9:25|Matthew 9:25}}, and {{niv|Luke|7:15|Luke 7:15}}).

====Disciples====
{{main|Twelve Apostles}}
Jesus called Jewish peasants to be his [[Twelve Apostles]], though many of his followers were considered [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]]. Jesus directs the apostles' mission only to those of the house of Israel ({{niv|Matthew|15:24|Matthew 15:24}}, {{niv|Matthew|10:1-6|Matthew 10:1-6}}). Three apostles, Peter, James, and John, are accorded a special status. In Mathhew, Jesus confers authority on Peter in particular and on the apostles in general, founding the Christian church.

====Teachings and Preachings====
{{main|Sermon on the Mount|Sermon on the Plain}}
[[Image:Bloch-SermonOnTheMount.jpg|left|thumb|250px|''Sermon on the Mount'', [[Carl Heinrich Bloch]], 19th c.]]
At the height of his ministry, Jesus is said to have attracted huge crowds numbering in the thousands, primarily in the areas of [[Galilee]] and Perea (in modern-day [[Israel]] and [[Jordan]] respectively).<ref>In ''John'', Jesus' ministry takes place in and around Jerusalem.</ref> Some of Jesus' most famous teachings come from the [[Sermon on the Mount]], which contained the [[Beatitudes]] and the [[Lord's Prayer]]. Jesus often employed [[Parables of Jesus|parables]], such as the [[Parable of the Prodigal Son]] and the [[Parable of the Sower]]. His teachings encouraged unconditional self-sacrificing [[agape|God-like love]] for God and for all people. During his sermons, he preached about service and humility, the forgiveness of sin, faith, [[Turn the other cheek|turning the other cheek]], [[Expounding of the Law#Love|love for one's enemies]] as well as friends, and the need to follow the spirit of [[Torah|the law]] in addition to the letter.<ref>''Sermon on the Mount'': {{niv|Matthew|5–7|Matthew 5–7}}; ''Prodigal Son'': {{niv|Luke|15:11–32|Luke 15:11–32}}; ''Parable of the Sower'': {{niv|Matthew|13:1–9|Matthew 13:1–9}}; ''Agape'': {{niv|Matthew|22:34–40|Matthew 22:34–40}}.</ref>

In the Synoptics, Jesus leads an [[Apocalypse|apocalyptic]] movement. He preaches that the [[End times|end of the current world]] will come unexpectedly, and that he will return to judge the world, especially according to [[The Sheep and the Goats|how they treated the vulnerable]]. He calls on his followers to be ever alert and faithful. In Mark, the Kingdom of God is a divine government that will forcibly appear within the lifetimes of his original followers.<ref name ="Harris Mark">[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], Understanding the Bible.

Jesus' outreach to outsiders includes the [[Samaritans]], who followed [[Samaritanism|a different form]] of the Israelite religion, as reflected in his  preaching to the Samaritans of [[Sychar]] ({{niv|John|4:1–42|John 4:1–42}}) and in the Good Samaritan.

====Transfiguration and Jesus' Divine Role====
{{main|Transfiguration of Jesus}}
According to the synoptic gospels, Jesus led three of [[Twelve Apostles|his apostles]] — [[Simon Peter|Peter]], [[John the Apostle|John]], and [[James the Great|James]] — to the top of a mountain to pray. While there, he was [[Transfiguration of Jesus|transfigured]] before them, his face shining like the sun and his clothes brilliant white; [[Elijah]] and [[Moses]] appeared adjacent to him. A bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the sky said, "This is my beloved son, with whom I am well pleased."<ref>{{niv|Matthew|17:1–6|Matthew 17:1–6}}, {{niv|Mark|9:1–8|Mark 9:1–8}}, {{niv|Luke|9:28–36|Luke 9:28–36}}</ref> The gospels also state that toward the end of his ministry, Jesus began to warn his disciples of his future death and resurrection ({{niv|Matthew|16:21–28|Matthew 16:21–28}}).

In Mark, Jesus' identity as the Messiah is obscured (see [[Messianic secret]]).<ref>"Messianic Secret." Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005</ref> Mark states that "this generation" will be given no sign, while Matthew and Luke say they will be given no sign but the sign of Jonah.<ref>[[Robert W. Funk|Funk, Robert W.]], Roy W. Hoover, and the Jesus Seminar. ''The five gospels.''

The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005</ref> Here he punctuates his ministry with several miraculous signs of his authority.

In the Synoptic Gospels, Jesus speaks primarily about the Kingdom of God (or Heaven).<ref>Introduction. [[Robert W. Funk|Funk, Robert W.]], Roy W. Hoover, and the Jesus Seminar. ''The five gospels.''

=== Arrest, trial, and death ===
{{main|Jesus and the Money Changers|Last Supper|Arrest of Jesus|Sanhedrin Trial of Jesus|Crucifixion of Jesus}}
[[Image:Eccehomo2.jpg|thumb|right|175px|''[[Ecce Homo]] (Behold the Man!)'', [[Antonio Ciseri]], 19th c.: Pontius Pilate presents a [[scourge]]d Jesus of Nazareth to onlookers: a very popular motif in Christian art.]]
In the account given by the synoptic gospels, Jesus came with his followers to Jerusalem during the Passover festival where a large crowd came to meet him, shouting, "[[Hosanna]]! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Blessed is the King of Israel!"<ref>The crowd was quoting {{niv|Psalms|118:26|Psalms 118:26}}; found in {{niv|John|12:13–16|John 12:13–16}}.</ref> Following his [[triumphal entry]],<ref>John puts the cleansing of the temple at the start of Jesus' ministry.</ref> Jesus created a disturbance at [[Herod's Temple]] by [[Jesus and the Money Changers|overturning the tables of the moneychangers]] who set up shop there, and claiming that they had made the Temple a "den of robbers." ({{niv|Mark|11:17|Mark 11:17}}). Later that week, Jesus celebrated the [[Passover|Passover meal]] with his disciples — an event subsequently known as the [[Last Supper]] — in which he prophesied that he would be betrayed by one of his disciples, and would then be executed. In this ritual he took bread and wine in hand, saying: "this is my body which is given for you" and "this cup which is poured out for you is the New Covenant in my blood," and instructed them to "do this in [[Eucharist|remembrance]] of me" ({{niv|Luke|22:7–20|Luke 22:7–20}}). Following the supper, Jesus and his disciples went to pray in the [[Garden of Gethsemane]].

While in the Garden, Jesus was [[Arrest of Jesus|arrested]] by temple guards on the orders of the [[Sanhedrin]] and the high priest, [[Caiaphas]] ({{niv|Luke|22:47–52|Luke 22:47–52}}, {{niv|Matthew|26:47–56|Matthew 26:47–56}}). The arrest took place clandestinely at night to avoid a riot, as Jesus was popular with the people at large ({{niv|Mark|14:2|Mark 14:2}}). [[Judas Iscariot]], one of his apostles, betrayed Jesus by identifying him to the guards with [[The Kiss of Judas|a kiss]]. Simon Peter, another one of Jesus' apostles, used a sword to attack one of Jesus' captors, cutting off his ear, which, according to Luke, Jesus immediately healed miraculously.<ref>The apostle is identified as [[Saint Peter|Simon Peter]] in {{niv|john|18:10|John 18:10}}; the healing of the ear is found in {{niv|luke|22:51|Luke 22:51}}.</ref> Jesus rebuked the apostle, stating "all they that take the sword shall perish by the sword" ({{niv|Matthew|26:52|Matthew 26:52}}). After his arrest, Jesus' apostles went into hiding.

[[Image:Cristo crucificado.jpg|thumb|left|175px|''[[Crucifixion]]'', [[Diego Velázquez]], 17th c.]]

During the [[Sanhedrin Trial of Jesus]], the high priests and elders asked Jesus, "Are you the [[Son of God]]?" When he replied, "You are right in saying I am," they condemned Jesus for [[blasphemy]] ({{niv|luke|22:70–71|Luke 22:70–71}}). The high priests then turned him over to the Roman [[List of Kings of Judea#Roman Procurators|procurator]] [[Pontius Pilate]], based on an accusation of [[sedition]] for forbidding the payment of taxes [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2023:1-2;&version=8; Luke 23:1-2] and claiming to be King of the Jews.<ref>{{niv|Matthew|27:11|Matthew 27:11}}; {{niv|Mark|15:2|Mark 15:12}}.</ref> When Jesus came before Pilate, Pilate asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?" to which he replied, "It is as you say." According to the Gospels, Pilate personally felt that Jesus was not guilty of any crime against the Romans, and since there was a custom at Passover for the Roman governor to free a prisoner (a custom not recorded outside the Gospels), Pilate offered the crowd a choice between Jesus of Nazareth and an insurrectionist named [[Barabbas]]. The crowd chose to have Barabbas freed and Jesus crucified. Pilate washed his hands to indicate that he was innocent of the injustice of the decision ({{niv|Matthew|27:11–26|Matthew 27:11–26}}).

According to all four Gospels, Jesus died before late afternoon at [[Calvary]], which was also called [[Golgotha]]. The wealthy Judean [[Joseph of Arimathea]], a member of the [[Sanhedrin]] according to Mark and Luke, received Pilate's permission to take possession of Jesus' body, placing it in a tomb.<ref>{{niv|Mark|15:42–46|Mark 15:42–46}}; {{niv|Luke|23:50–56|Luke 23:50–56}}.</ref> According to John, Joseph was aided by [[Nicodemus]], who joined him to help bury Jesus, and who appears in other parts of John's gospel ({{niv|John|19:38–42|John 19:38–42}}). The three Synoptic Gospels tell of the [[crucifixion eclipse|darkening of the sky]] from twelve until three that afternoon; Matthew also mentions an [[earthquake]] ({{niv|Matthew|27:51|Matthew 27:51}}, the earth breaking open and a number of righteous dead people rising out of the grave and going into Jerusalem.

=== Resurrection and Ascension ===
{{main|Resurrection of Jesus|Harrowing of Hell|Resurrection appearances of Jesus|Great Commission|Ascension of Jesus Christ|Second Coming}}
[[Image:Grunewald - christ.jpg|thumb|right|175px|''Christ en majesté'', [[Matthias Grünewald]], 16th c.: [[Resurrection of Jesus]]]]
The Gospels state that Jesus [[resurrection of Jesus|rose from the dead]] on the third day after his [[crucifixion]].<ref name="Resurrection">{{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Matthew |chapter=28|verse=5|range=-10}}; {{niv|mark|16:9|Mark 16:9}}; {{niv|luke|24:12–16|Luke 24:12–16}}; {{niv|John|20:10–17|John 20:10–17}}; {{niv|Acts|2:24|Acts 2:24}}; {{niv|1Cor|6:14|1Cor 6:14}}</ref> In the Gospel of Matthew, an angel appeared near the tomb of Jesus and announced his resurrection to [[Mary Magdelene]] and "another Mary" who had arrived to [[anoint]] the body ({{niv|Matthew|28:1–10|Matthew 28:1–10}}). According to Luke there were two angels ({{niv|Luke|24:4|Luke 24:4}}), and according to Mark there was a youth dressed in white ({{niv|Mark|16:5|Mark 16:5}}). The "[[Mark 16|longer ending]]" to Mark states that on the morning of his resurrection, Jesus first appeared to Mary Magdalene ({{niv|Mark|16:9|Mark 16:9}}). John states that when Mary looked into the tomb, two angels asked her why she was crying; and as she turned round she initially failed to recognize Jesus until he spoke her name ({{niv|john|20:11–18|John 20:11–18}}).

The Gospels all recount appearances by Jesus to his disciples. In Matthew, Jesus proclaims the great commission to baptize the nations. In John, Jesus commissions Peter as the shepherd of the new community.<ref>[[Robert W. Funk|Funk, Robert W.]] and the [[Jesus Seminar]]. ''The acts of Jesus: the search for the authentic deeds of Jesus.'' HarperSanFrancisco. 1998. p. 491</ref> Also in John, Jesus demonstrates his physical presence to "[[doubting Thomas]]."<ref name ="Harris">[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985.</ref>

The [[Acts of the Apostles]] state that Jesus appeared to various people in various places over the next forty days. Hours after his resurrection, he appeared to two travelers on the road to [[Emmaus]] ({{niv|Luke|24:13–35|Luke 24:13–35}}). To his assembled disciples he showed himself on the evening after his resurrection ({{niv|John|20:19|John 20:19}}). Although his own ministry had been specifically to Jews, Jesus is said to have sent his apostles to the Gentiles with the [[Great Commission]] and [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|ascended]] to heaven while a cloud concealed him from their sight. According to Acts, [[Paul of Tarsus]] had a vision of Jesus during his [[Road to Damascus]] experience. Jesus promised to [[Second Coming|come again]] to fulfill the remainder of [[Messianic prophecy]].<ref>''Ministering to Israel'': {{niv|Matthew|15:24|Matthew 15:24}}; ''ascension'': {{niv|Mark|16:19|Mark 16:19}}; {{niv|Luke|24:51|Luke 24:51}}{{niv|Acts|1:6–11|Acts 1:6–11.}}; ''Paul's conversion on the road to Damascus'': {{niv|Acts|9:1–19|Acts 9:1–19.}}, {{bibleverse-nb || Acts|22:1–22|31}}; {{bibleverse-nb || Acts|26:9–24|31}}; ''Second coming'': {{niv|Matthew|24:36–44|Matthew 24:36–44}}</ref>

== Historical views ==
{{main|Historical Jesus|Quest for the historical Jesus}}
Scholars have used the [[historical method]] to develop probable reconstructions of Jesus' life. Over the past two hundred years, the image of Jesus among historical scholars has come to be very different from the common image of Jesus that was based on the gospels.<ref>[[Marcus Borg|Borg, Marcus J.]] in Borg, Marcus J. and N. T. Wright. The Meaning of Jesus: Two visions. New York: HarperCollins. 2007.</ref> Some scholars draw a distinction between Jesus as reconstructed through historical methods and Jesus as understood through a theological point of view, while other scholars hold that a [[Religious perspectives on Jesus|theological Jesus]] represents a historical figure.<ref>See, for an example of the latter, Pope [[Benedict XVI]], ''Jesus of Nazareth''. Doubleday, 2007. ISBN 978-0-385-52341-7</ref> The principal sources of information regarding Jesus' life and teachings are the gospels, especially the synoptic gospels: [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]]. Biblical scholars and historians accept the historical existence of Jesus.<ref>"The nonhistoricity thesis has always been controversial, and it has consistently failed to convince scholars of many disciplines and religious creeds.&nbsp;... Biblical scholars and classical historians now regard it as effectively refuted." - [[Robert E.

The English title of Albert Schweitzer's 1906 book, ''The Quest of the Historical Jesus,'' is a label for the post-Enlightenment effort to describe Jesus using critical historical methods.<ref name="Oxford:Historical">Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005 - article "Historical Jesus, Quest of the"</ref> Since the end of the 18th century, scholars have examined the gospels and tried to formulate historical biographies of Jesus. Contemporary efforts benefit from a better understanding of 1st-century Judaism, renewed Roman Catholic biblical scholarship, broad acceptance of critical historical methods, sociological insights, and literary analysis of Jesus' sayings.<ref name="Oxford:Historical" />

=== Constructing a historical view ===
{{main|Historical Jesus|Cultural and historical background of Jesus}}
Historians analyze the gospels to try to discern the historical man on whom these stories are based. They compare what the gospels say to historical events relevant to the times and places where the gospels were written. They try to answer historical questions about Jesus, such as why he was crucified.

Most scholars agree the Gospel of Mark was written about the time of the destruction of [[Herod's Temple|the Jewish Temple]] by the Romans under [[Titus]] in the year 70, and that the other gospels were written between 70–100.<ref>Meier (1991), pp.43–4</ref> The historical outlook on Jesus relies on [[Biblical criticism|critical analysis of the Bible]], especially the gospels. Many scholars have sought to reconstruct Jesus' life in terms of contemporaneous political, cultural, and religious currents in Israel, including differences between Galilee and Judea, and between different sects such as the [[Pharisees]], [[Sadducees]], [[Essenes]] and [[Zealots]],<ref>For a comparison of the Jesus movement to the Zealots, see [[S. G. F. Brandon]], ''Jesus and the Zealots: a study of the political factor in primitive Christianity,'' Manchester University Press (1967) ISBN 0–684–31010–4</ref><ref name="comparison">For a general comparison of Jesus' teachings to other schools of first century Judaism, see [[John P.

=== Descriptions ===

Historians generally describe Jesus as a healer who preached the restoration of God's kingdom.<ref>[[Shaye J.D. Cohen]], ''From the Maccabees to the Mishnah'', Westminster Press, 1987, p. 78, 93, 105, 108; [[John Dominic Crossan]], ''The Historical Jesus: The Life of a Mediterranean Jewish Peasant'', HarperCollins, 1991, p. xi – xiii; Michael Grant, p. 34–35, 78, 166, 200; [[Paula Fredriksen]], ''Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews'', Alfred B.

Sanders, pp. 12–13; [[Geza Vermes]], Jesus the Jew (Philadelphia: Fortress Press 1973), p. 37.;</ref> Most historians agree he was baptized by John the Baptist, and was crucified by the Romans.

John the Baptist led a large apocalyptic movement. He demanded repentance and baptism. Jesus was baptized and later began his ministry. After John was executed, some of his followers apparently took Jesus as their new leader.<ref name=autogenerated1>Sanders, E.P. ''Jesus and Judaism.''

According to Robert Funk, Jesus taught in pithy parables and with striking images.<ref name = "5G">[[Robert W. Funk|Funk, Robert W.]], Roy W. Hoover, and the Jesus Seminar. ''The five gospels.''

=== Names and titles ===
{{Jesus}}
{{main|Names and titles of Jesus in the New Testament}}
Jesus probably lived in [[Galilee]] for most of his life and he probably spoke [[Aramaic]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.godward.org/Hebrew%20Roots/did%20jesus%20speak%20hebrew.htm|title=Brian Knowles: Which Language Did Jesus Speak – Aramaic or Hebrew?}}</ref> The name "Jesus" comes from an alternate spelling of the [[Latin language|Latin]] (''Iēsus'') which in turn comes from the [[Koine Greek|Greek]] name Iesous (''{{Polytonic|Ιησους}}''). The name has also been translated into English as "[[Joshua]]."<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374x.htm "Origin of the Name of Jesus Christ"]. ''Catholic Encyclopedia''. Retrieved April 14, 2007.''</ref> Further examination of the [[Septuagint]] finds that the Greek, in turn, is a transliteration of the Hebrew/[[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] [[Yeshua (name)|Yeshua]] ({{lang|he|ישוע}}) (''Yeshua'' — he will save) a contraction of Hebrew name ''Yehoshua'' ({{lang|he|יהושוע}} ''Yeho'' — [[Yahweh]] [is] ''shua`'' — deliverance/rescue, usually Romanized as ''Joshua''). Scholars believe that one of these was likely the name that Jesus was known by during his lifetime by his peers.<ref>Durant, Will. ''Caesar and Christ''. New York: Simon and Schuster, 1944. p. 558; John P. Meier, ''A Marginal Jew''. New York: Doubleday, 1991 vol. 1:205–7;</ref>

''[[Christ]]'' (which is a title and not a part of his name) is an Anglicization of the Greek term for ''[[Messiah]]'' (''χριστός'', from the verb ''χρίω'' "to anoint"), and literally means "anointed one." Historians have debated what this title might have meant at the time Jesus lived; some historians have suggested that other titles applied to Jesus in the New Testament had meanings in the first century quite different from those meanings ascribed today.<ref>Vermes, "Jesus the Jew: A Historian's Reading of the Gospels"</ref>

The titles "Divine," "[[Son of God]]," "God," "God from God," "Lord," "Redeemer," "Liberator,", "The Prince of Peace", "The Wonder Counsellor" and "Saviour of the World" were each applied to the Roman emperors. [[John Dominic Crossan]] considers that the application of them to Jesus by the early Christians would have been regarded as denying them to the emperor(s). "They were taking the identity of the Roman emperor and giving it to a Jewish peasant. Either that was a peculiar joke and a very low lampoon, or it was what the Romans called ''majestas'' and we call high treason."<ref> Crossan, John Dominic, God and Empire, 2007, p. 28</ref>

Many New Testament scholars argue that Jesus himself made no claims to being God.<ref>"A further point of broad agreement among New Testament scholars is&nbsp;... that the historical Jesus did not make the claim to deity that later Christian thought was to make for him: he did not understand himself to be God, or God the Son, incarnate.

=== Religious groups ===

Scholars refer to the religious background of the early 1st century to better reconstruct Jesus' life. Some scholars identify him with one or another group.

====Pharisees====
[[Pharisees]] were a powerful force in 1st-century Judea. Early Christians shared several beliefs of the Pharisees, such as resurrection, retribution in the next world, angels, human freedom, and Divine Providence.<ref>"Pharisees." Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005</ref> After the fall of the Temple, the Pharisee outlook was established in Rabbinic Judaism. Some scholars speculate that Jesus was himself a [[Pharisee]].<ref>Based on a comparison of the Gospels with the [[Talmud]] and other Jewish literature.<!-- Sanders is disputed, see talk[[E. P.

Funk|Funk, Robert W.]] and the [[Jesus Seminar]]. ''The acts of Jesus: the search for the authentic deeds of Jesus.'' HarperSanFrancisco. 1998.</ref>

====Sadducees====
The [[Sadducee]] sect was particularly powerful in Jerusalem. They accepted the written Law only, rejecting the traditional interpretations accepted by the Pharisees, such as belief in retribution in an afterlife, resurrection of the body, angels, and spirits. After Jesus caused a disturbance at the Temple, it seems{{weasel-inline|Date=November 2008}} to have been the Sadducees who had him arrested and turned over to the Romans for execution. After the fall of Jerusalem, they disappeared from history.<ref>"Sadducees." Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005</ref>

====Essenes====
[[Essenes]] were apocalyptic ascetics, one of the three (or four) major Jewish schools of the time, though they were not mentioned in the [[New Testament]].<ref>Based on a comparison of the Gospels with the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], especially the [[Teacher of Righteousness]] and Pierced Messiah.

See also Broshi, Magen, "What Jesus Learned from the Essenes," ''[[Biblical Archaeology Review]],'' 30:1, pg. 32–37, 64. Magen notes similarities between Jesus' teachings on the virtue of poverty and divorce, and Essene teachings as related in Josephus' ''[[The Jewish Wars]]'' and in the [[Damascus Document]] of the Dead Sea Scrolls, respectively. See also [[Keith Akers| Akers, Keith]] ''The Lost Religion of Jesus.'' Lantern, 2000. ISBN 1-930051-26-3.</ref> Some scholars theorize that Jesus was an [[Essene]], or close to them.

====Apocalyptic sect====
Most scholars hold that the movement Jesus led was apocalyptic, expecting God to intervene imminently to restore Israel. John the Baptist's movement was apocalyptic, and Jesus began his public career as one of his followers.<ref>Crossan, John Dominic. The essential Jesus. Edison: Castle Books. 1998. p. 146</ref> Scholars commonly surmise that Jesus' eschatology was apocalyptic, like John's.<ref>See [[Albert Schweitzer|Schwietzer, Albert]] ''The Quest of the Historical Jesus: A Critical Study of its Progress from Reimarus to Wrede,'' pp. 370–371, 402.

Patai and Klausner state that one interpretation of the prophecies reveal either two Messiahs, Messiah ben Yosef (the dying Messiah) and Messiah ben David (the Davidic King), or one Messiah who comes twice. Crossan cites the Essene teachings about the twin Messiahs. Compare to the Christian doctrine of the [[Second Coming]].</ref> This is distinct from an earlier commission Jesus gave to the [[twelve Apostles]], limited to "the lost sheep of the house of Israel" and specifically excluding the Gentiles or [[Samaritans]] ({{niv|Matthew|10|Matthew 10}}).-->

=== Christian scripture as historical texts ===
{{main|Higher criticism}}

Historians examine Christian scripture for important clues about the historical Jesus. They sort out sayings and events that are more likely to be genuine and use those to construct their portraits of Jesus. The Gospel tradition has certainly preserved several authentic fragments of Jesus' teaching.

The New Testament was at least substantially complete by AD 100, making its books, especially the synoptic gospels, historically relevant.<ref>"The New Testament was complete, or substantially complete, about AD 100, the majority of the writings being in existence twenty to forty years before this ...the situation is encouraging from the historian's point of view, for the first three Gospels were written at a time when many were alive who could remember the things that Jesus said and did... At any rate, the time elapsing between the evangelic events and the writing of most of the New Testament books was, from the standpoint of historical research, satisfactorily short." Bruce, F. F.: ''The New Testament Documents: Are They Reliable?'', pp. 12-14, InterVarsity Press, USA, 1997.</ref> The Gospel tradition certainly preserves several fragments of Jesus' teaching.<ref>"There is no reason to doubt that we have in the Gospel tradition several authentic fragments of His [Jesus Christ's] teaching (albeit in Greek translation)."

Biblical scholars hold that the works describing Jesus were initially communicated by [[oral history|oral tradition]], and were not committed to writing until several decades after Jesus' crucifixion. After the original oral stories were written down in Greek, they were transcribed, and later translated into other languages. <!--(Find a more noteworthy scholar than Sir Frederic) Having been written, the New Testament sources encountered insignificant changes, according to scholars such as the late [[Frederic Kenyon|Sir Frederic Kenyon]] (1863 - 1952).<ref>"The interval then between the dates of the original composition and the earliest extant evidence becomes so small as to be in fact negligible, and the last foundation for any doubt that the Sciptures have come down to us substantially as they were written has now been removed. Both the ''authenticity'' and the ''general integrity'' of the books of the New Testament may be regarded as finally established." As quoted in Bruce, F. F.: ''The New Testament Documents: Are They Reliable?'', p. 20, InterVarsity Press, USA, 1997.</ref>-->Contemporary textual critic [[Bart D.

Critical scholars consider scriptural accounts more likely when they are attested in multiple texts, plausible in Jesus' historical environment, and potentially embarrassing to the author's Christian community. The "[[criterion of embarrassment]]" holds that stories about events with aspects embarassing to Christians (such as the denial of Jesus by [[Saint Peter|Peter]], or the fleeing of Jesus' followers after his arrest) would likely not have been included if those accounts were fictional.<ref name="A Marginal Jew"> Meier, John P., [[John P.

The earliest [[extant text]]s which refer to Jesus are [[Paul the Apostle|Paul's]] letters (mid-1st century), which affirm Jesus' crucifixion.

=== Mythical view ===
{{Main|Jesus myth hypothesis}}
{{see|Jesus Christ and comparative mythology}}
A few scholars have questioned the existence of Jesus as an actual historical figure. Among the proponents of non-historicity was [[Bruno Bauer]] in the 19th century. Non-historicity was somewhat influential in biblical studies during the early 20th century.
(The views of scholars who entirely rejected Jesus' historicity then were summarized in the chapter on Jesus in [[Will Durant]]'s ''Caesar and Christ'' (in 1944); they were based on a suggested lack of eyewitness, a lack of direct archaeological evidence, the failure of certain ancient works to mention Jesus, and similarities early Christianity shares with then-contemporary religion and mythology.<ref>Durant 1944:553-7</ref>)

More recently, arguments for non-historicity have been discussed by authors such as [[George Albert Wells]] and [[Robert M. Price]]. Additionally, [[The Jesus Puzzle]] and [[The Jesus Mysteries]] are examples of popular works promoting the non-historical hypothesis. 

Nevertheless, non-historicity has been rejected by almost all Biblical scholars and historians.<ref>Bruce, FF (1982). ''New Testament Documents: Are They Reliable?''

Projects become "dead" by being abandonded because they are no longer thought to be productive. "Refuted" means some VERY strong evidence against it has been found--> In ''Jesus Outside the New Testament'' (2000), [[Robert E.

To sum up, modern critical methods fail to support the Christ myth theory. It has 'again and again been answered and annihilated by first rank scholars.' In recent years, 'no serious scholar has ventured to postulate the non historicity of Jesus' or at any rate very few, and they have not succeeded in disposing of the much stronger, indeed very abundant, evidence to the contrary."

{{main|Christian views of Jesus|Christology}}
Though [[Christianity|Christian]] views of Jesus vary, it is possible to describe a general majority Christian view by examining the similarities between specific Western Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and many Protestant doctrines found in their [[catechism|catechetical]] or [[Confessionalism (religion)|confessional]] texts.<ref>This section draws on a number of sources to determine the doctrines of these groups, especially the early Creeds, the Catechism of the Catholic Church, certain theological works, and various Confessions drafted during the Reformation including the Thirty Nine Articles of the Church of England, works contained in the Book of Concord, and others.</ref> This view, given below, does not encompass all groups which describe themselves as Christian, with alternative views immediately following.

==== Savior and Redeemer ====
Christians profess that Jesus is the Messiah (Greek: ''Christos''; English: Christ) prophesied in the [[Old Testament]],<ref>''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' §436–40; ''Thirty Nine Articles of the Church of England'', article 2; Irenaeus ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus Haereses]]'' in ''[[Patrologia Graeca]]'' ed.

Migne]] (Paris, 1857–1866) 7/1, 93; {{niv|Luke|2:1|Luke 2:11}}; {{niv|Matthew|16:16|Matthew 16:16}}</ref> who, through his life, death, and resurrection, restored humanity's communion with God in the blood of the [[New Covenant (theology)|New Covenant]]. His death on a cross is understood as the redemptive sacrifice: the source of humanity's salvation and the atonement for [[sin]]<ref>''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' §606–618; Council of Trent (1547) in Denzinger-Schönmetzer, ''Enchiridion Symbolorum, definitionum et declarationum de rebus fidei et morum'' (1965) §1529;{{niv|John|14:2–3|John 14:2–3}}</ref> which had [[The Fall of Man|entered human history]] through the [[Original sin|sin of Adam]].<ref>''Thirty Nine Articles of the Church of England'', article 9; ''Augsburg Confession'', article 2; ''Second Helvetic Confession'', chapter 8; {{niv|Romans|5:12–21|Rom 5:12–21}}; {{niv|1_Corthians|15:21–22|1 Cor 15:21–22}}.</ref>

The [[Atonement (satisfaction view)|satisfaction view]] of [[substitutionary atonement|atonement]] for sin, first articulated by [[Anselm of Canterbury]], is that humanity owes God a debt of honor. This debt creates essentially an imbalance in the moral universe; it could not be satisfied by God's simply ignoring it. In this view, the only possible way of repaying the debt was for a being of infinite greatness, acting as a man on behalf of men, to repay the debt of honor owed to God. Therefore, when Jesus died, he paid a debt to God, his father. [[Thomas Aquinas]] consider atonement and articulated that rather than seeing the debt as one of honor, he sees the debt as a moral injustice to be righted. Aquinas concludes that punishment is a morally good response to sin, "Christ bore a satisfactory punishment, not for His, but for our sins," and substitution for another's sin is entirely possible.<ref>[[Thomas Aquinas]], ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', First Part of the Second Part, Question 87, Article 7, Reply to Objection 3, available [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2087.htm here]</ref>

Christians also profess that Jesus suffered death by [[crucifixion]],<ref>[[Apostles' Creed]]; [[Nicene Creed]];[[Luther's Small Catechism]] commentary on [[Apostles' Creed]]; ''Second Helvetic Confession'', chapter 9</ref> and rose bodily from the dead in the definitive miracle that foreshadows the [[Resurrection of the dead|resurrection]] of humanity at the end of time,<ref>''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' §638–655; Byzantine Liturgy, ''Troparion'' of Easter; ''Thirty Nine Articles of the Church of England'', article 4 and 17; ''Augsburg Confession'', article 3; ''Second Helvetic Confession'', chapter 9.</ref> when Christ will come again to [[Last judgment|judge the living and the dead]],<ref>[[Apostles' Creed]]; [[Nicene Creed]]; [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] §668–675, 678–679; [[Luther's Small Catechism]] commentary on [[Apostles' Creed]]; {{niv|Matthew|25:32–46|Mt 25:32–46}}</ref> resulting in either entrance into heaven or damnation.<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2L.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church §1021-1022]</ref> The [[Death and resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] is perhaps the most controversial aspect of the life of Jesus. Christianity hinges on this point of Christology, both as a response to a particular history and as a confessional response.<ref>[[Reginald H. Fuller#The Foundations of New Testament Christology (1965)|Fuller 1965, p. 15]]</ref> Christians believe that Jesus' resurrection brings reconciliation with God (II Corinthians 5:18), the destruction of death (I Corinthians 15:26), and [[Atonement|forgiveness of sins]] for followers of Jesus.

[[Image:Christology.gif|left|thumb|350px|Comparison of Christological positions]]

Between 325 and 681, Christians theologically articulated and refined their view of the nature of Jesus by a series of seven [[ecumenical council]]s (see [[Christology]]). These councils described Jesus as one of the three divine [[Hypostasis (religion)|hypostases]] or persons of the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]]: the Son is defined as constituting, together with God the Father and the Holy Spirit, the single [[Ousia|substance]] of the One God (see ''[[Communicatio idiomatum]]'').<ref>''Nicene Creed''; ''Thirty Nine Articles of the Church of England'', article 1; ''Augsburg Confession'', article 1; ''Second Helvetic Confession'', chapter 3; Council of Nicaea I (325) in Denzinger-Schönmetzer, ''{{lang|la|Enchiridion Symbolorum, definitionum et declarationum de rebus fidei et morum}}'' (1965) §126; Council of Constantinople II (553) in ibid. §424 and 424; Council of Ephesus in ibid. §255; {{niv|John|1:1|John 1:1}}; {{niv|John|8:58|8:58}}; {{niv|John|10:30|10:30}}</ref> Furthermore, Jesus is defined to be one person with a fully human and a fully divine [[Physis|nature]], a doctrine known as the [[Hypostatic union]].<ref>''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' §464–469; ''Thirty Nine Articles of the Church of England'', article 2 and 3 ''Second Helvetic Confession'', chapter 9; Council of Ephesus (431) in Denzinger-Schönmetzer, ''{{lang|la|Enchiridion Symbolorum, definitionum et declarationum de rebus fidei et morum}}'' (1965) §250; Council of Ephesus in ibid. §251; Council of Chalcedon (451) in ibid. §301 and 302; {{niv|Hebrews|4:15|Hebrews 4:15}}.</ref>

[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] believe Jesus to be God's (or Jehovah's) son, rather than being God himself. Jehovah's Witnesses believe he was the same divine created being as [[Archangel Michael|Michael the Archangel]],<ref> "Revelation—Its Grand Climax at Hand!" –1988 | chap. 27 pp. 180-181 par. 15 "God's Kingdom Is Born!" | . © Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania | "But who is Michael?

He likely did so in Eden, for on two of the three occasions where mention is made of God's speaking there, the record specifically shows someone was with Him, undoubtedly his Son. (Ge 1:26-30; 2:16, 17; 3:8-19, 22) The angel who guided Israel through the wilderness and whose voice the Israelites were strictly to obey because 'Jehovah's name was within him,' may therefore have been God's Son, the Word.—Ex 23:20-23; compare Jos 5:13-15."</ref> In line with this, they point out that the Bible presents him as the only way humans can approach God.

The [[Unity Church]] considers Jesus the master teacher and "way show-er," citing Jesus' frequent calls to emulate him rather than worship him, and the ability of others to be like him, such as in John 10:34 and John 14:12. Jesus is not worshiped as God, but regarded as someone who had achieved a complete connection with God the Father.

[[Christadelphians]] believe that Jesus is literally God's son, hence the Biblical title ''son of God'',<ref>{{cite book | last = Flint | first = James | authorlink = | coauthors = Deb Flint | title = One God or a Trinity? | publisher = Printland Publishers | date = | location = Hyderabad | pages = p. 3 | url = http://www.christadelphia.org/pamphlet/p_onegod.htm#3 | doi = | id = | isbn = 81-87409-61-4 }}</ref> not ''God the Son''.

Others believe that the one God, who revealed himself in the Old Testament as Jehovah, came to earth, taking on the human form of Jesus Christ. They believe Jesus is Jehovah, is the Holy Spirit, and is the one Person who is God. Examples of such churches today are [[Oneness Pentecostals]] and the [[New Church]].

==== Other early views ====

[[Image:Christ Carrying the Cross 1580.jpg|thumb|right|''Jesus Carrying the Cross'', [[El Greco]], 1580]]
Various [[early Christian]] groups and theologians held differing views of Jesus.
The [[Ebionites]], an early [[Jewish Christian]] community, believed that Jesus was the last of the [[Prophet#Prophets in the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible)|prophets]] and the [[Messiah]]. They believed that Jesus was the natural-born son of Mary and Joseph, and thus they rejected the Virgin Birth. The Ebionites were [[Adoptionism|adoptionists]], believing that Jesus was not divine, but became the [[son of God]] at his baptism. They rejected the [[Epistles of Paul]], believing that Jesus kept the [[Mosaic Law]] perfectly and wanted his followers to do the same. However, they felt that Jesus' crucifixion was the ultimate sacrifice, and thus [[animal sacrifice]]s were no longer necessary. Therefore, some Ebionites were [[vegetarian]] and considered both Jesus and [[John the Baptist]] to have been vegetarians.<ref>Ehrman, Bart D. ''Lost Christianities'', Oxford, 2003, p. 102.</ref>

The Apologists of the 2nd century, such as [[Justin Martyr]], saw Jesus as the Logos or Word of God united with a human being. They viewed the Logos, in line with Middle Platonism, as the source of order and rationality, but distinct from God.<ref>"Christology." Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005</ref>

In [[Gnosticism]], Jesus is said to have brought the secret knowledge ([[gnosis]]) of the spiritual world necessary for salvation.<ref>McManners, John, ed., ''The Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity,'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1990, pp. 26–31.</ref> Their secret teachings were paths to gnosis, and not gnosis itself.<!-- The previous sentence is necessary to clarify that gnosis is a different concept than the teachings of Scientology. --> While some Gnostics were [[docetism|docetics]], other Gnostics believed that Jesus was a human who became possessed by the spirit of Christ during his baptism.<ref>Ehrman, Bart D. ''Lost Christianities'', Oxford, 2003, p. 124–125.</ref> Many Gnostics believed that Christ was an [[Aeons#In Gnosticism|Aeon]] sent by [[Monad (Gnosticism)|a higher deity]] than the evil [[Demiurge#Gnosticism|demiurge]] who created the material world. Some Gnostics believed that Christ had a [[Syzygy#Gnosticism|syzygy]] named [[Sophia (wisdom)|Sophia]]. The Gnostics tended to [[Gnosticism and the New Testament|interpret the books that were included in the New Testament]] as [[allegory]], and some Gnostics interpreted Jesus himself as an allegory. The Gnostics also used a number of [[Gnostic texts|other texts]] that did not become part of the New Testament canon.

[[Marcionites]] were 2nd century [[Gentile]] followers of the Christian theologian [[Marcion of Sinope]]. They believed that Jesus rejected the [[Tanakh|Jewish Scriptures]], or at least the parts that were incompatible with his teachings.<ref>[[Henry Wace|Wace, Henry]], [http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/info/marcion-wace.html "Commentary on Marcion"], Retrieved April 16, 2007.</ref> Seeing a stark contrast between the vengeful God of the [[Old Testament]] and the loving God of Jesus, Marcionites, like some Gnostics, came to the conclusion that the Jewish God was the evil creator of the world and Jesus was the savior from the material world. They also believed Jesus was not human, but instead a completely divine spiritual being whose material body, and thus his crucifixion and death, were [[docetism|divine illusions]].<ref>Ehrman, Bart D. ''Lost Christianities'', Oxford, 2003, p. 103, p. 104–105, p.108</ref> Marcionism was declared a [[Heresy#Christianity|heresy]] by proto-orthodox Christianity.

[[Sabellius]] in the 3rd century taught that the Trinity represented not three persons but a single person in three "modes." Jerome reported that the [[Montanists]] of his day shared this view.

=== Islamic views ===

==== Majority view ====
{{main|Jesus in Islam}}
[[Image:Jesus-masih-islam.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sermon on the Mount]] in Islamic art]]
[[Islam]] holds Jesus ({{lang-ar|عيسى}} '''''`Īsā''''') to have been a messenger of God and the messiah who had been sent to guide the [[Children of Israel]] (''banī isrā'īl'') with a new scripture, the ''[[Injil|Injīl]]'' (gospel).<ref> [[The Oxford Dictionary of Islam]], p.158</ref> According to the [[Qur'an]], believed by Muslims to be God's final revelation, Jesus was born to Mary (Arabic: Maryam) as the result of [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virginal conception]], a miraculous event which occurred by the decree of [[God]] (Arabic: [[Allah]]). To aid him in his quest, Jesus was given the ability to perform [[miracle]]s. These included speaking from the cradle, curing the blind and the [[leper]]s, as well as raising the dead; all by the permission of God. Furthermore, Jesus was helped by a band of disciples (the ''ḥawāriyūn''). Islam states that Jesus was not killed nor [[Crucifixion|crucified]], but that he had been raised alive up to [[jannah|heaven]]. Islamic traditions narrate that he will return to earth near the [[day of judgement]] to restore justice and defeat ''[[Dajjal|al-Masīḥ ad-Dajjāl]]'' (''lit''. "the false messiah," also known as the [[Antichrist]]) and the enemies of Islam. As a just ruler, Jesus will then die.<ref name="EoI-Isa">"Isa," Encyclopedia of Islam</ref>

Like all [[prophets in Islam]], Jesus is considered to have been a [[Muslim]], as he preached for people to adopt the straight path in submission to God's will. Islam denies that Jesus was God or the [[son of God]], stating that he was an ordinary man who, like other prophets, had been divinely chosen to spread God's message. Islamic texts forbid the association of partners with God (''[[shirk]]''), emphasizing the notion of God's [[tawhid|divine oneness]] (''tawhīd''). As such, Jesus is referred to in the Qur'an frequently as the "son of Mary" ("''Ibn Maryam''").<ref name="EoI-Isa"/><ref>Fasching, deChant (2001) p. 241</ref> Numerous titles are given to Jesus in the Qur'an, such as ''mubārak'' (blessed) and ''`abd-Allāh'' (servant of God). Another title is ''al-Masīḥ'' ("the [[messiah]]; the anointed one" i.e. by means of blessings), although it does not correspond with the meaning accrued in Christian belief. Jesus is seen in Islam as a precursor to [[Muhammad]], and is believed by Muslims to have foretold the latter's coming.<ref name="EoI-Isa"/>

==== Ahmadiyya views ====
{{main|Jesus in Ahmadiyya Islam}}
According to the early 20th century teachings of the [[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadi Muslims]] of Northern India, Jesus did not die on the cross, but after his apparent death and resurrection (or resuscitation from his tomb) he journeyed east to [[Jammu and Kashmir|Kashmir]] to further teach the gospel until his natural death<ref>{{citation|last=Rice|first=Edward|title=Eastern Definitions: A Short Encyclopedia of Religions of the Orient|year=1978|publisher=New York|isbn=0-385-08563-X|pages=7}}.</ref> (The general notion of Jesus in Kashmir is older than the Ahmadi tradition,<ref name="ShaeferCohen">{{citation|last=Schäfer|first=Peter|last2=Cohen|first2=Mark R.|title=Toward the Millennium: Messianic Expectations from the Bible to Waco|year=1998|location=Leiden/Princeton|publisher=Brill/Princeton UP|isbn=90-04-11037-2|pages=306}}.</ref> and is discussed at length by Grönbold<ref>Günter Grönbold, Jesus In Indien, München: Kösel 1985, ISBN 3466202701.</ref> and Klatt<ref>Norbert Klatt, ''Lebte Jesus in Indien?'', Göttingen: Wallstein 1988.</ref>).

Following Jesus' death of natural causes (so the Ahmadi tradition) "at a ripe old age of roughly 120 years,"<ref name="Faruqi_1983_98">{{citation|last=Faruqi|first=Nisar Ahmed|chapter=The Promised Messiah|title=Ahmadiyyat in the Service of Islam|year=1983|publisher=Ahmadiyya Anjuman Ishaat|location=Lahore|isbn=0-913321-00-1|at=chap. 3|chapter-url=http://www.aaiil.org/text/books/others/naseerahmadfaruqui/ahmadiyyatserviceislam/promisedmessiah_pf.shtml|pages=98}}.</ref> [[Jesus in Ahmadiyya Islam|Jesus according to Ahmadi doctrine]] was then laid to rest in [[Srinagar]], and that the tomb of a sage known locally as [[Roza Bal|Yuz Asaf]] (which in [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]] means  "Leader of the Healed"<ref>http://www.tjresearch.info/legends.htm</ref>) is really the tomb of Jesus of Nazareth.<ref>{{citation|last=Houtsma|first=M.

Further, according to this movement, the second coming predicted in the Muslim tradition is not actually that of Jesus, but that of a person "similar to Jesus" (''mathīl-i ʿIsā''), i.e. [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad|the founder of the movement]] himself and his teachings were representative of Jesus.<ref name="ShaeferCohen" />

According to the [[Encyclopedia of Islam]], Ahmadi Christological beliefs are one of the three primary characteristics that distinguish Ahmadi teachings from general Islamic ones, and that it had provoked a ''[[fatwa]]'' against the founder of the sect, "purporting that this doctrine disagreed with the [[Koran]] and therefore had to be looked upon as a heresy."<ref name="EI">{{harvnb|Houtsma|1913|p=260}}.</ref>

=== Judaism's view ===
{{main|Judaism's view of Jesus}}
[[Judaism]] holds the idea of Jesus being God, or part of a Trinity, or a mediator to God, to be heresy.<ref>''[[Emunoth ve-Deoth]]'', II:5</ref> Judaism also holds that Jesus is not the [[Jewish messianism|Messiah]], arguing that he had not fulfilled the [[Messianic prophecies]] in the [[Tanakh]] nor embodied the personal qualifications of the Messiah. According to Jewish tradition, there were no more prophets after [[Malachi]], who lived centuries before Jesus and delivered his prophesies about 420 BC/BCE. Judaism states that Jesus did not fulfill the requirements set by the [[Torah]] to prove that he was a prophet. Even if Jesus had produced such a sign that Judaism recognized, Judaism states that no prophet or dreamer can contradict the laws already stated in the Torah, which Jesus did.<ref>[[Shraga Simmons|Simmons, Shraga]], [http://www.aish.com/jewishissues/jewishsociety/Why_Jews_Dont_Believe_In_Jesus.asp "Why Jews Do not Believe in Jesus"], Retrieved April 15, 2007; [http://ohr.edu/ask_db/ask_main.php/2637/Q1/ "Why Jews Do not Believe in Jesus"], [[Ohr Somayach, Jerusalem|Ohr Samayach]] — ''Ask the Rabbi'', Retrieved April 15, 2007; [http://www.askmoses.com/qa_detail.html?h=120&o=350 "Why do not Jews believe that Jesus was the messiah?"], [[AskMoses.com]], Retrieved April 15, 2007</ref>

The ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' (an authoritative work of [[halakha|Jewish law]]) states in ''Hilkhot Melakhim'' 11:10–12 that Jesus is a "stumbling block" who makes "the majority of the world err to serve a divinity besides God."<ref>"Even Jesus the Nazarene who imagined that he would be [[Jewish Messiah|Messiah]] and was killed by the court, was already prophesied by [[Daniel]]. So that it was said, "And the members of the outlaws of your nation would be carried to make a (prophetic) vision stand. And they stumbled." (Daniel 11.14) Because, is there a greater stumbling-block than this one? So that all of the [[prophet]]s spoke that the Messiah redeems Israel, and saves them, and gathers their banished ones, and strengthens their commandments. And this one caused (nations) to destroy Israel by sword, and to scatter their remnant, and to humiliate them, and to exchange the Torah, and to make the majority of the world err to serve a divinity besides God. However, the thoughts of the Creator of the world — there is no force in a human to attain them because our ways are not God's ways, and our thoughts not God's thoughts. And all these things of Jesus the Nazarene, and of ([[Muhammad]]) the [[Ishmael]]ite who stood after him — there is no (purpose) but to straighten out the way for the King Messiah, and to restore all the world to serve God together. So that it is said, "Because then I will turn toward the nations (giving them) a clear lip, to call all of them in the name of God and to serve God (shoulder to shoulder as) one shoulder."(Zephaniah 3.9) Look how all the world already becomes full of the things of the Messiah, and the things of the [[Torah]], and the things of the commandments! And these things spread among the far islands and among the many nations uncircumcised of heart.

Judaism rejects the claim that a new covenant was created with Jesus and asserts instead that the chain of Tradition reaching back to Moshe continues to make valid claims on our lives, and serve as more than mere window dressing.

[[Mandaeanism]], a very small Mideastern, Gnostic sect that reveres [[John the Baptist]] as God's greatest prophet, regards Jesus as a false prophet of the false Jewish god of the Old Testament, [[Names of God in Judaism|Adonai]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gnosis.org/library/haran.htm|title=Mandaean Scriptures and Fragments: ''The Haran Gawaitha''|accessmonthday=April 20|accessyear=2007}}</ref> and likewise rejects [[Abraham]], [[Moses]], and [[Muhammad]].

Many writers emphasize Jesus' moral teachings. [[Garry Wills]] argues that Jesus' ethics are distinct from those usually taught by Christianity.<ref> Wills, Garry, ''What Jesus Meant'' (2006) ISBN 0–670–03496–7</ref> The [[Jesus Seminar]] portrays Jesus as an itinerant preacher who taught peace and love, rights for women and respect for children, and who spoke out against the hypocrisy of religious leaders and the rich.<ref>[[John Dominic Crossan|Crossan, John Dominic]], ''The Historical Jesus: The Life of a Mediterranean Jewish Peasant'', HarperSanFrancisco (1993), ISBN 0–06–061629–6; [[Robert Funk]], ''The Five Gospels: What Did Jesus Really Say? The Search for the AUTHENTIC Words of Jesus'', Harper San Francisco (1997), ISBN 0–06–063040-X; [[Robert Funk]], ''The Acts of Jesus: What Did Jesus Really Do?'', The Jesus Seminar, Harper San Francisco (1998), ISBN 0–06–062978–9; The [[Jesus Seminar]], ''The Gospel of Jesus: According to the Jesus Seminar'', Robert Walter Funk (Editor), Polebridge Press (1999), ISBN 0–944344–74–7</ref> [[Thomas Jefferson]], one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] and a [[deism|deist]], created the [[Jefferson Bible]] entitled "The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth" that included only Jesus' ethical teachings because he did not believe in Jesus' divinity or any of the other supernatural aspects of the [[Bible]].

According to most Christian interpretations of the [[Bible]], the theme of Jesus' teachings was that of [[repentance]], [[agape|unconditional love]],<ref>{{niv|John|13:34–35|John 13:34–35}}</ref> [[forgiveness]] of [[sin]], [[Divine grace|grace]], and the coming of the [[Kingdom of God]].<ref>Sniegocki, John.

Christianity spread throughout the [[Roman Empire]] under a version known as [[Nicene Christianity]] and became the [[state religion]] under [[Theodosius I]]. Over the centuries, it spread to most of [[Europe]], and around the world.

Jesus has been [[Images of Jesus|drawn, painted, sculpted]] and [[Dramatic portrayals of Jesus|portrayed on stage and in films]] in many different ways, both serious and [[Jesus in Pop culture|humorous]]. The figure of Jesus features prominently in art and literature. A number of popular novels, such as ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'', have also portrayed various ideas about Jesus, and a number of films, such as ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'', have portrayed his life, death, and resurrection. Many of the sayings attributed to Jesus have become part of the culture of [[Western world|Western civilization]]. There are many items purported to be [[relics of Jesus]], of which the most famous are the [[Shroud of Turin]] and the [[Sudarium of Oviedo]].

Other legacies include a view of God as more lovingly parental, merciful, and more forgiving, and the growth of a belief in a blissful [[afterlife]] and in the [[resurrection of the dead]]. His teaching promoted the value of those who had commonly been regarded as inferior: women, the poor, ethnic outsiders, children, prostitutes, the sick, prisoners, etc. For over a thousand years, countless hospitals, orphanages, and schools have been founded explicitly in Jesus' name. Jesus and his message have been interpreted, explained and understood by many people. Jesus has been explained notably by [[Paul of Tarsus]], the [[Church Fathers]], including [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Martin Luther]], and more recently by [[C. S. Lewis]] and [[Pope John Paul II]]. [[Thomas Jefferson]] considered Jesus' teaching to be "the most sublime and benevolent code of morals which has ever been offered to man."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/co/JeffersonBible/jeffintr.html|title=The Jefferson Bible|accessmonthday=April 20|accessyear=2007}}</ref>

For some Jews, the legacy of Jesus has been a history of [[Christianity and antisemitism|Christian antisemitism]],<ref> "Christian Antisemitism: A History of Hate" by William Nicholls, 1993. Published by Jason Aronson Inc., 1995; "Mature Christianity: The Recognition and Repudiation of the Anti-Jewish Polemic in the New Testament" Norman A. Beck, Susquehanna Univ. Press, 1985; "The Satanizing of the Jews: Origin and development of mystical anti-Semitism" Joel Carmichael, Fromm, 1993; "The Origins of Anti-Semitism: Attitudes Toward Judaism in Pagan and Christian Antiquity" [[John Gager|John G.

Wilken, Univ. of California Press, Berkeley, 1983</ref> although in the wake of [[the Holocaust]] many Christian groups have gone to considerable lengths to reconcile with Jews and to promote interfaith dialog and mutual respect. For others, Christianity has often been linked to European [[colonialism]].<ref>''Of Revelation and Revolution, Volume 1: Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa'' by Jean Comaroff, John L. Comaroff 1991 University of Chicago Press; ''A Violent Evangelism: The Political and Religious Conquest of the Americas'' by Luis Rivera Pagan 1992 Westminster Press; ''The Americas in the Spanish World Order: The Justification for Conquest in the 17th century'' by James Muldoon 1994 University of Pennsylvania Press; ''An Empire Divided: Religion, Republicanism, and the Making of French Colonialism, 1880–1914 by J.P.

B. Eerdmans</ref> Conversely, some have argued that through [[Bartolomé de las Casas]]' defense of the indigenous inhabitants of Spain's New World empire, one of the legacies of Jesus has been the notion of universal [[human rights]].
