[[Mary Wollstonecraft]]'s '''''A Vindication of the Rights of Woman''''' (1792) is one of the earliest [[feminist]] works of literature or philosophy. In it, Wollstonecraft responds to the educational and political theorists of her day who wanted to deny women an education; she argues that women deserve an education commensurate with their position in society. She then proceeds to redefine that position, claiming that women are essential to the nation because they educate its children and that they should be "companions," rather than mere wives, to their husbands. Rather than viewing women as ornaments to society or property to be traded in marriage, Wollstonecraft maintained that they were human beings who deserved the same fundamental rights as men.

==Historical context==
''A Vindication of the Rights of Woman'' was written against the tumultuous background of the [[French Revolution]] and the debate that it spawned in Britain. In the lively and sometimes vicious British pamphlet war, now referred to as the "Revolution Controversy," writers addressed topics ranging from representative government to human rights to the separation of church and state.<ref>On the "Revolution Controversy" see Marilyn Butler, ed., ''Burke, Paine, Godwin, and the Revolution Controversy''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (2002).</ref> Wollstonecraft first entered this fray in 1790 with ''A Vindication of the Rights of Men'', a response to [[Edmund Burke]]'s ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790), the text which sparked the heated printed exchanges of the Revolution Controversy.<ref>Wollstonecraft, Mary. ''The Vindications: The Rights of Men and The Rights of Woman.'' Eds. D.L. Macdonald and Kathleen Scherf. Toronto: Broadview Literary Texts (1997), 9-10.</ref> In his ''Reflections'', Burke criticizes the view of many British thinkers and writers who had welcomed the early stages of the French Revolution. While they saw the revolution as a reflection of Britain's own [[Glorious Revolution]] in 1688, Burke saw it as the violent overthrow of a legitimate government. He argues that citizens do not have the right to challenge their government; for Burke, governments and societies consist of traditions that had been reached as a result of social consensus and the end result of challenging tradition would be anarchy. One of the key arguments of Wollstonecraft's ''Rights of Men'', published just six weeks after Burke's ''Reflections'', is that tradition should not have any authority; rights, she argues, should be conferred because they are reasonable and just, not because they are traditional.<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 43-4.</ref>

When in 1791, [[Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord]] argued in ''Rapport sur l'instrcution publique'' (1791) that women as well as men should be included under the French Assembly's [[Declaration of the Rights of Man]], Wollstonecraft was galvanized to reply. That same year French feminist [[Olympe de Gouge]] published her ''Rights of Woman'', making the question of women's rights central in both France and Britain.<ref>Macdonald and Scherf, "Introduction," 11-12.</ref> ''A Vindication of the Rights of Woman'', then, was an extension of Wollstonecraft's arguments in the ''Rights of Men''&mdash;she continued to ask who should be granted what rights and on what grounds&mdash;and engaged specifically with the events in France and the Revolution Controversy in Britain.

==Themes==
Unlike most philosophical writers of the eighteenth century, Wollstonecraft did not employ a formal structure in ''A Vindication of the Rights of Woman''. The text is essentially one long essay that introduces all of its major topics in the opening chapters and then repeatedly returns to them throughout the text, each time from a different point of view. It also adopts a hybrid tone&mdash;one that combines the rational argument common to philosophy and the fervent rhetoric of [[sensibility]].

===Rational education===
One of Wollstonecraft's central arguments in the ''Vindication of the Rights of Woman'' is that women should be educated rationally so that they can contribute to society. In the eighteenth century, it was often assumed by educational philosophers and conduct-book writers (those who advised parents on how to educate their children), that women were incapable of rational thought. Women, it was thought, were too emotional and too fragile to be able to think clearly; moreover, it was asserted, women were incapable of abstract thought&mdash;they were far better at detailed observation. Wollstonecraft, along with other female reformers such as [[Catharine Macaulay]] and [[Hester Chapone]], argued that women were indeed capable of rational thought and deserved to be educated.

Wollstonecraft states in her "Preface" that “my main argument is built on this simple principle, that if [woman] be not prepared by education to become the companion of man, she will stop the progress of knowledge and virtue; for truth must be common to all." Without educated women, Wollstonecraft argues, society will degenerate, particularly because mothers are the primary educators of young children.<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 102.</ref> Wollstonecraft attributes the problem of uneducated women to men and “a false system of education, gathered from the books written on this subject by men who, considering females rather as women than human creatures.”<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 109.</ref> She thus makes the argument that women are capable of rationality; the only reason it appears women are incapable of rational thought, she argues, is because men have encouraged them to be uneducated and silly (she refers to women, for example, as "spaniels" and "toys" at one point<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 144.</ref>).

Wollstonecraft responds vitriolically to conduct-book writers such as [[James Fordyce]] and [[John Gregory]] as well as educational philosophers such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who argue that a woman does not need a rational education. (Rousseau famously argues in ''[[Emile: Or, On Education|Emile]]'' (1762) that women should be educated for the pleasure of men.) Wollstonecraft is intent on illustrating the limitations that the current educational system places upon women; she writes: "Taught from their infancy that beauty is woman’s sceptre, the mind shapes itself to the body, and, roaming round its gilt cage, only seeks to adorn its prison."<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 157.</ref> Without this damaging ideology, which encourages young women to focus their attention on beauty and outward accomplishments, Wollstonecraft implies, they could achieve much more. Wollstonecraft also maintains that wives can be the rational "companions" of their husbands and even pursue careers should they so choose: "women might certainly study the art of healing, and by physicians as well as nurses. And midwifery, decency seems to allot to them&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they might, also, study politics&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Business of various kinds, they might likewise pursue."<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 286.</ref> Wollstonecraft describes "the most perfect education" as "an exercise of the understanding as is best calculated to strengthen the body and form the heart. Or, in other words, to enable the individual to attach such habits of virtue as will render it independent.”<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 129.</ref>

In addition to her larger philosophical arguments, Wollstonecraft also lays out a specific educational plan. In Chapter 12, "On National Education", she argues that all children should be sent to a "country day school" as well as given some education at home "to inspire a love of home and domestic pleasures." She also maintains that schooling should be [[coeducation|co-educational]], arguing that men and women, whose marriages are "the cement of society", should be "educated after the same model."

===Feminism===
It is debatable to what extent the ''Vindication of the Rights of Woman'' is a feminist text; because definitions of [[feminism|feminist]] vary, different scholars have come to different conclusions. Wollstonecraft herself would never have referred to her texts as feminist because the words ''feminist'' and ''feminism'' were not coined until the 1890s.<ref>''Oxford English Dictionary''.</ref> Moreover, there was no [[feminist movement]] to speak of during Wollstonecraft's lifetime. In the introduction to her seminal work on Wollstonecraft's thought, Barbara Taylor writes,
<blockquote>
Describing [Wollstonecraft's philosophy] as feminist is problematic, and I do it only after much consideration. The label is of course anachronistic&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Treating Wollstonecraft’s thought as an anticipation of nineteenth and twentieth-century feminist argument has meant sacrificing or distorting some of its key elements. Leading examples of this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. have been the widespread neglect of her religious beliefs, and the misrepresentation of her as a bourgeois liberal, which together have resulted in the displacement of a religiously inspired utopian radicalism by a secular, class-partisan reformism as alien to Wollstonecraft’s political project as her dream of a divinely promised age of universal happiness is to our own. Even more important however has been the imposition on Wollstonecraft of a heroic-individualist brand of politics utterly at odds with her own ethically driven case for women’s emancipation. Wollstonecraft’s leading ambition for women was that they should attain virtue, and it was to this end that she ought their liberation.<ref>Taylor, Barbara. ''Mary Wollstonecraft and the Feminist Imagination''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (2003), 12.</ref>
</blockquote>

In the ''Rights of Woman'' Wollstonecraft does not argue for gender equality in the same way or use the same language as late nineteenth and twentieth-century feminists would; she does not claim that men and women are equal&mdash;she argues that they are equal in some areas but that it those areas which are most significant. For example, she contends that all men and women are equal in the eyes of God and that, as a result, they are all subject to the same moral laws.<ref>See, for example Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 126, 146.</ref> While this may not seem revolutionary, its implications are. For example, Wollstonecraft argues that both men and women should be modest (not just women)<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 102 and 252.</ref> and that both men and women should respect the sanctity of marriage (not just women).<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 274.</ref> Her argument illustrated the sexual double standard of the late eighteenth century and demanded that men adhere to the same virtues demanded of women.

Furthermore, when Wollstonecraft revised the ''Rights of Woman'' for the second edition, she took the opportunity to bolster the feminist claims in her argument.<ref>Macdonald and Scherf, "Introduction," 23 and Anne K. Mellor, “Mary Wollstonecraft’s ''A Vindication of the Rights of Woman'' and the women writers of her day.” ''The Cambridge Companion to Mary Wollstonecraft''. Ed. Claudia L. Johnson. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (2002), 141-2.</ref> She changed some of her statements regarding female and male difference to reflect a greater equality between the sexes.<ref>Mellor, 141-2.</ref>

However, such claims of equality stand in contrast to her statements respecting the superiority of masculine strength and valor.<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 110.</ref> Wollstonecraft famously and ambiguously states: "Let it not be concluded that I wish to invert the order of things; I have already granted, that, from the constitution of their bodies, men seem to be designed by Providence to attain a greater degree of virtue. I speak collectively of the whole sex; but I see not the shadow of a reason to conclude that their virtues should differ in respect to their nature. In fact, how can they, if virtue has only one eternal standard? I must therefore, if I reason consequentially, as strenuously maintain that they have the same simple direction, as that there is a God."<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 135.</ref>

Moreover, as Mary Poovey and other scholars have pointed out, Wollstonecraft calls on men, rather than women, to initiate the social and political changes she outlines in the ''Rights of Woman''. Because women are uneducated, Wollstonecraft argues, they cannot alter their own situation&mdash;men must come to their aid.<ref>Poovey, Mary. ''The Proper Lady and the Woman Writer: Ideology as Style in the Works of Mary Wollstonecraft, Mary Shelley and Jane Austen''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press (1984), 79.</ref> At the end of the ''Rights of Woman'', Wollstonecraft begs "Be just then, O ye men of understanding!"<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 343.</ref>

===Sensibility===
One of Wollstonecraft's most scathing criticisms in ''Vindication of the Rights of Woman'' is against false and excessive [[sensibility]], particularly in women. She argues that women who succumb to sensibility are "blown about by every momentary gust of feeling"; because they are "the prey of their senses," they cannot think rationally.<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 177.</ref> In fact, she claims, not only do they do harm to themselves but they also do harm to all of civilization: these are not women who can refine civilization, these are women who will destroy it. But, Wollstonecraft does not argue that reason and feeling should act independently of each other; rather, she believes that they should inform each other.<ref>Jones, 46.</ref>

As part of her argument that women should not be overly influenced by their feelings, Wollstonecraft emphasizes that they should not be bound by their bodies or by their sexual feelings.<ref>See, for example, Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 259-60.</ref> This particular argument has drawn the criticism of many modern feminists; they contend that Wollstonecraft not only avoids embracing female sexuality, she fears its power. Cora Kaplan argues that the ''Rights of Woman'' “expresses a violent antagonism to the sexual; it exaggerates the importance of the sensual in the everyday life of women, and betrays the most profound anxiety about the rupturing force of female sexuality.”<ref>Kaplan, Cora. “While Nights: Pleasure/Sexuality/Feminism.” ''Sea Changes: Essays on Culture and Feminism''. London: Verso (1986), 41.</ref>.

===Republicanism===
Claudia Johnson, a prominent Wollstonecraft scholar, has argued that the ''Vindication of the Rights of Woman'' is a "a republican manifesto."<ref>Johnson, Claudia. ''Equivocal Beings: Politics, Gender, and Sentimentality in the 1790s: Wollstonecraft, Radicliffe, Burney, Austen''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press (1995), 24.</ref> Johnson contends that Wollstonecraft is interested in reestablishing a [[republican]] ethos, one that contains strong but distinct masculine and feminine roles for its citizens.<ref>Johnson, 29.</ref> According to Johnson, Wollstonecraft "denounces the collapse of proper sexual distinction as the leading feature of her age, and as the grievous consequence of sentimentality itself. The problem undermining society in her view is feminized men."<ref>Johnson, 23.</ref> If men feel free to adopt both the masculine position and the sentimental feminine position, she argues, women have no position open to them in society.<ref>Johnson, 45.</ref> Johnson therefore sees Wollstonecraft as a critic of the "masculinization of sensitivity" in works such as [[Edmund Burke]]'s ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]''<ref>Johnson, 30.</ref>

In the ''Rights of Woman'' Wollstonecraft adheres to a version of republicanism that advocates for the eventual overthrow of all titles, including the monarchy. She also briefly suggests that all men and women should be represented in government. But the bulk of her “political criticism,” as Chris Jones, one of the foremost Wollstonecraft scholars, explains, “is couched predominantly in terms of morality.”<ref>Jones, Chris. “Mary Wollstonecraft’s ''Vindications'' and their political tradition.” ''The Cambridge Companion to Mary Wollstonecraft''. Ed. Claudia L. Johnson. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (2002), 43.</ref> Her definition of virtue focuses on the individual’s happiness rather than, for example, the good of the entire society.<ref>Jones, 43.</ref> For Wollstonecraft, moreover, the individual is educated into republicanism and republican benevolence within the family; domestic relations and ties are crucial to her understanding of social cohesion and patriotism.<ref>Jones, 46 and ''Vindications'', 101-102, for example.</ref>

===Class===
Wollstonecraft addressed her text to the middle-class, what she called the "most natural state." In many ways the ''Vindication of the Rights of Woman'' is inflected by a [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] view of the world; two of the virtues Wollstonecraft praises most often are modesty and industry.<ref>See Gary Kelly, ''Revolutionary Feminism: The Mind and Career of Mary Wollstonecraft''. London: Macmillan (1992).</ref> She also attacks the wealthy using the same language with which she accuses women of worthlessness. But she is not necessarily a friend to the poor; for example, in her national plan for education, she suggests that, after the age of nine, the poor be separated from the rich and taught in another school.<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 311.</ref> She even argues that the poor are lucky because they will never be trapped by the snares of wealth: “Happy is it when people have the cares of life to struggle with; for these struggles prevent their becoming a prey to enervating vices, merely from idleness!”<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 169.</ref> Moreover, she contends that giving charity only results in negative consequences because, as Jones puts it, she “sees it as sustaining an unequal society while giving the appearance of virtue to the rich.”<ref>Jones, 45.</ref>

==Rhetoric and style==
Although Wollstonecraft argues against excessive sensibility, the rhetoric of the ''Rights of Woman'' is at times heated and attempts to provoke the reader. Wollstonecraft herself even comments on this effect. While she claims to write in a plain style so that her ideas would reach the broadest possible audience,<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 111-12.</ref> she actually combines the plain, rational language of the political treatise with the poetic, passionate language of sensibility in order to demonstrate that one can combine rationality and sensibility in the same self. Wollstonecraft defends her positions not only with reasoned argument but also with ardent rhetoric.

In her efforts to vividly describe the condition of women within society, for example, Wollstonecraft employs several different analogies. She often compares women to slaves, arguing that their ignorance and powerlessness places them in that position. But she also argues that they are "capricious tyrants" who use cunning and deceit to manipulate the men around them. At one point, she reasons that a woman can become either&mdash;the two, slave and tyrant, are two sides of the same coin and both are equally undesirable.<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 158.</ref> Wollstonecraft also compares women, unflatteringly, to soldiers; like military men, they are valued only for their appearance. She also compares them to the rich; both, through their "softness" "debased mankind."<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 165.</ref> Perhaps most insultingly, Wollstonecraft argues, women are consistently infantalized; she scoffs at the benefits of innocence, arguing that to remain innocent means to remain in "a state of childhood."<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 178.</ref>

==Reception==
''A Vindication of the Rights of Woman'' was reviewed positively when it was first published in 1792.<ref>Janes, R.M. "On the Reception of Mary Wollstonecraft’s A Vindication of the Rights of Woman". ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' 39 (1978): 293-302.</ref> Moreover, other writers such as [[Mary Hays]] and [[Mary Robinson (poet)|Mary Robinson]] specifically alluded to Wollstonecraft in their own work. Hays cited the ''Rights of Woman'' in her novel ''Emma Courtney'' and modeled her female characters after Wollstonecraft's ideal woman.<ref>Mellor, 143-4 and 146.</ref> Even more significantly, although female conservatives such as [[Hannah More]] excoriated Wollstonecraft herself, as Anne K. Mellor has shown, they actually shared many of the same values; for example, they both wanted a society founded on “Christian virtues of rational benevolence, honesty, personal virtue, the fulfillment of social duty, thrift, sobriety, and hard work.”<ref>Mellor, 147.</ref> During the early 1790s, many writers within British society were engaged in a healthy debate regarding the position of women in society. [[Anna Laetitia Barbauld]] and Wollstonecraft even sparred back and forth; Barbauld published several poems responding to Wollstonecraft’s work and Wollstonecraft commented on them in footnotes to the ''Rights of Woman''.<ref>Mellor, 153.</ref>

After Wollstonecraft died in 1797 and her husband [[William Godwin]] published his ''Memoirs of the Author of the Vindication of the Rights of Woman'' (1798), revealing Wollstonecraft's unorthodox lifestyle, she was vilified. After the publication of Godwin’s ''Memoirs'', Wollstonecraft’s ideas became associated with her life story and women writers felt that it was dangerous to mention her in their texts. [[Hays]], who had previously been an outspoken advocate for Wollstonecraft and her ''Rights of Woman'', for example, did not include her in the collection of "Illustrious and Celebrated Women" she published in 1803.<ref>Mellor, 145.</ref> [[Maria Edgeworth]] specifically distances herself from Wollstonecraft in her novel ''Belinda'' (1802); she caricatures Wollstonecraft as a radical feminist in the character of Harriet Freke.<ref>Mellor, 155.</ref> But, like [[Jane Austen]], she does not reject Wollstonecraft’s ideas. Both Edgeworth and Austen argue that women are crucial to the development of the nation; moreover, they portray women as rational beings who should choose companionate marriage.<ref>Mellor, 156.</ref> The negative views of Wollstonecraft persisted for over a century; in fact, there is a common assumption today that ''Rights of Woman'' was hostilely received. It was not until R. M. Janes did his exhaustive study of the reviews of the book that scholars realized it was not controversial until after Wollstoncraft's death.

While the ''Rights of Woman'' may have paved the way for feminist arguments, twentieth century feminists have tended to use Wollstonecraft's life story for inspiration rather than her texts; her unorthodox lifestyle inspired them to break free from traditional norms.<ref>Kaplan, Cora.
