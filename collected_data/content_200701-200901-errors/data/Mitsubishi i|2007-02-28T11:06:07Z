The {{nihongo|'''Mitsubishi i'''|三菱・i|Mitsubishi i}} is a [[Japan]]ese ''[[kei car]]'' from [[Mitsubishi Motors]], first released on [[January 24]] [[2006]].<ref name="newconcept">[http://media.mitsubishi-motors.com/pressrelease/e/products/detail1407.html "New concept for the future of small: 'i'"], Mitsubishi Motors press release, [[January 24]] [[2006]]</ref> Explaining the choice of name, the company stated that they want to encourage the owners ('I') to express themselves fully, while the letter 'i' could also stand for innovation, a keyword in the car's development.<ref>[http://media.mitsubishi-motors.com/pressrelease/e/corporate/detail1276.html "Mitsubishi Motors chooses 'Outlander' and 'i' as names for new SUV and kei minicar models"], Mitsubishi Motors press release, [[May 23]] [[2005]]</ref> It is also a play on the Japanese word for love, [[International Phonetic Alphabet|pronounced]] /aɪ/.<ref>[http://www.automobilemag.com/auto_shows/2003_fms_mitsui/ "Mitsubishi i Concept"], Automobilemag.com, [[January 12]] [[2004]]</ref>

It debuted twenty eight months after its introduction as a [[concept car]] at the 60th [[Frankfurt Motor Show]] in 2003,<ref name="testcar">[http://www.mitsubishi-motors.com/corporate/about_us/technology/environment/e/i.html ""i" Concept Test Car"], Mitsubishi Motors website</ref> and proved an immediate critical and commercial success, exceeding Mitsubishi's initial sales targets by 20 percent and winning four major awards in its first year.<ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/autos/autobeat/archives/2006/11/mitsubishis_awa.html "Mitsubishi's award winning minicar"], Ian Rowley, BusinessWeek online, [[November 14]] [[2006]]</ref><ref name="sales">[http://www.worldcarfans.com/news.cfm/newsid/2060421.002/country/jcf/Mitsubishi/new-mitsubishi-outlander-japan's-best-selling-suv "New Mitsubishi Outlander Japan's Best Selling SUV"], Mitsubishi GB press release, WorldCarFans.com, [[April 21]] [[2006]]</ref>

==Specifications==
[[Image:I concept engine.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The ''i'''s rear-mounted engine as seen in cutaway, behind the rear seats and under the floor of the rear hatch storage area.]]
===Drivetrain===
The '''i''' has a "[[RMR layout|rear-midship]]" engine mounted just ahead of the rear [[axle]], and a four-speed [[automatic transmission]] with [[rear wheel drive|rear-]] or [[four-wheel drive]], depending on specification. European distributors are advertising forthcoming versions as featuring the company's ''[[INVECS-II]]'' [[semi-automatic transmission]].<ref name="future">[http://www.mitsubishi-cars.co.uk/futuremodels/index.asp Future Models], Mitsubishi Motors UK website</ref> The ''[[Mitsubishi 3B engine|3B20]]'' [[aluminium]]-[[cylinder block|block]] three cylinder powerplant has a [[engine displacement|displacement]] of 659&nbsp;[[cubic centimetre|cc]], a [[DOHC]] [[cylinder head]] with [[MIVEC]] [[variable valve timing]] and an [[intercooler|intercooled]] [[turbocharger]], giving peak power of 47&nbsp;[[watt|kW]] (64&nbsp;[[Horsepower#PS|PS]]) at 6000&nbsp;[[rpm]] and peak torque of 94&nbsp;[[newton metre|N·m]] (69&nbsp;[[Foot-pound force|ft·lbf]]) at 3000&nbsp;rpm. A [[naturally aspirated]] version has been introduced for 2007, offering 38&nbsp;kW (52&nbsp;PS) at 7000&nbsp;rpm and 57&nbsp;N·m (42&nbsp;ft·lbf) at 4000&nbsp;rpm.<ref>[http://media.mitsubishi-motors.com/pressrelease/e/corporate/detail1542.html "Mitsubishi Motors Announces FY2006 First Half Financial Results and Forecasts for the Full Year"], Mitsubishi Motors press release, [[October 30]] [[2006]]</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = "Mitsubishi i performance" | publisher = Mitsubishi-motors.co.jp | date = [[February 26]] [[2007]] | language = Japanese | url = http://www.mitsubishi-motors.co.jp/i/performance/index.html }}</ref>

===Body and dimensions===
A lightweight [[aluminium]] [[space frame]] structure and a rear-engined layout allowed Mitsubishi to incorporate a larger front [[crumple zone]], in order to meet current safety legislation without compromising interior space.<ref name="newconcept"/> With no [[powertrain]] up front, the designers were able to shorten the front overhang and lengthen the [[wheelbase]] to 2550&nbsp;[[millimetre|mm]] (100.4&nbsp;[[Inch|in]]), giving greater legroom for passengers than many comparable ''kei'' cars whose wheelbase is typically 130–190&nbsp;mm (5.1–7.5&nbsp;in) less.<ref name="autozine">[http://www.autozine.org/html/Mitsubishi/i.html "Mitsubishi i"], Mark Wan, Autozine.org, [[November 18]] [[2005]]</ref> The downside of this design was a reduction in cargo-carrying capacity, which was necessarily compromised by the engine's location in the rear; the car has 659&nbsp;[[litre]]s (23.26&nbsp;[[cubic foot|cu&nbsp;ft]]) of luggage space with the rear seats folded, considered "off the pace" by reviewers.<ref>[http://www.channel4.com/4car/di/road+test/driving+impression/993/3 "Driven: Mitsubishi i"], Euan Sey, 4Car, [[April 26]], [[2006]]</ref><ref>[http://www.nihoncarandbike.com/news-280-X.html "Mitsubishi i"], G-A.G, Nihon Car and Bike, [[May 15]] [[2006]]</ref>

===Suspension, brakes and tires===
[[MacPherson strut]]s are used in the front [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]], and an unusual three-link [[De Dion tube]]/[[Watt's linkage]] is used in the rear.<ref name="testcar"/> Front [[disc brake|discs]] with [[anti-lock braking system|anti-lock braking (ABS)]] and [[electronic brakeforce distribution|electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD)]] are standard across the range.<ref>{{cite web | title = "Mitsubishi i specifications" | publisher = Mitsubishi-motors.co.jp | date = [[February 26]] [[2007]] | language = Japanese | url = http://www.mitsubishi-motors.co.jp/i/spec/index.html }}</ref> In common with many other mid- or rear-engined vehicles its fifteen&nbsp;inch wheels have uneven-sized tires, 145/65 on the fronts and wider 175/55 on the rears, in an effort to minimise the chances of [[oversteer]] caused by the rear-biased weight distribution.<ref name="autozine"/>

[[Image:2003 i concept.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Mitsubishi "i" Concept]]
Two [[concept car|prototypes]] were exhibited during the car's development. The first was the '''"i" Concept''', which debuted at the 2003 [[Frankfurt Motor Show]] and previewed the car's egg-shaped design,<ref>[http://motoring.independent.co.uk/features/article1090796.ece "Mitsubishi 'i': All round, a very good egg"], Euan Sey, ''The Independent online edition'', [[June 20]] [[2006]]</ref> an allusion by [[France|French]]-born stylist [[Olivier Boulay]] to the [[Renault 4CV]] according to some reviewers, who commented that the shape provided a "crystal ball" with which to see the future of Mitsubishi.<ref>[http://www.redbook.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story/D468D5BB21915C26CA2572100028B913?OpenDocument "Tokyo show: Mitsubishi's crystal ball concepts"], Byron Mathioudakis, redbook.goauto.com, [[21 October]] [[2003]]</ref> It would prove successful enough that in October 2006 the '''i''' won the Grand Prize at the 50th anniversary Good Design Awards from the Japanese [[Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry|Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry]], the first minicar to win the award.<ref>[http://media.mitsubishi-motors.com/pressrelease/e/corporate/detail1539.html "i" takes Good Design Grand Prize 2006], Mitsubishi Motors press release, [[October 25]] [[2006]]</ref>

[[Image:2003 se-ro.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Mitsubishi SE-RO]]

The "i" Concept was powered by a 999&nbsp;cc powerplant with the company's Mitsubishi Smart Idling (MSI) system, which turns off the engine automatically when the vehicle is stationary, and can restart it within 0.2&nbsp;seconds.<ref>[http://www.mitsubishi-motors.com/corporate/about_us/technology/review/e/pdf/2004/16E.pdf Mitsubishi Motors Technical Review 2004 no.16, pp.29-50]</ref> So equipped, Mitsubishi claimed the car was capable of fulfilling the "three litre initiative" for [[gasoline]] [[piston engines|engines]], meaning fuel consumption of no more than 3.0&nbsp;[[Litre|L]] per 100&nbsp;[[kilometre|km]] (94.2&nbsp;[[fuel economy in automobiles|mpg]], 78.4&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;mpg). However, the second concept car, known as '''SE-RO''' and exhibited at the 2003 [[Tokyo Motor Show]], previewed the production model's more conventional mechanical underpinnings, despite having a more radically styled body which bore little resemblance to the final design.<ref>[http://archive.cardesignnews.com/autoshows/2003/tokyo/preview/mitsubishi-sero/index.html "Mitsubish Sero concept for the Tokyo Motor Show"], Car Design News, [[October 16]] [[2003]]</ref>

Mitsubishi has given the '''i''' a prominent role in the company's [[alternative propulsion]] research projects, with a version introduced using their [[MIEV]] technology in 2006 and exhibited at the 22nd International Battery, Hybrid and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle Symposium & Exposition in [[Yokohama]]. MMC plans to provide three power companies with vehicles in 2006 and 2007 in order to evaluate how fast-charge infrastructure may be developed for [[electric vehicle]]s. Fleet testing by five power companies will be conducted later in 2007.<ref>[http://media.mitsubishi-motors.com/pressrelease/e/corporate/detail1533.html "Mitsubishi Motors builds new research EV, "i MiEV" for joint research with power companies"], Mitsubishi Motors press release, [[October 11]] [[2006]]</ref>

==Domestic and international markets==
Priced from [[Japanese yen|¥]]1,281,000 to ¥1,617,000, Mitsubishi initially aimed for 5,000 cars per month within the domestic market, and in its first month managed to exceed its target by over 1,000.<ref name="sales"/> The company has already introduced the '''i''' to [[Singapore]], [[Brunei]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[New Zealand]],<ref>[http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/CW/20061010/FREE/61009008/1111 "Waiting for Export"], James B.

[[Hindustan Motors]], a long time partner of Mitsubishi, will also import the '''i''' in [[CKD|complete knock down (CKD)]] form to [[India]], where 25,000 cars per year will be assembled in their [[Chennai]] plant for the local market alongside the [[Mitsubishi Lancer|Lancer Cedia]] and [[Mitsubishi Pajero|Pajero]] [[SUV]]. A locally-produced engine may also be built at the company's Pithampore facility.<ref>[http://subscribers.wardsauto.com/ar/hindustan_i_minicar/ "Hindustan Motors to Bring Mitsubishi 'i' Minicar to India"], Sudhakar Shah, WardsAuto.com, [[August 3]] [[2006]] (subscription required for full article)</ref>

==Hello Kitty and other special editions==
From [[July 25]]–[[July 31|31]], [[2006]] the company displayed a unique ''Mitsubishi i [[Hello Kitty]] edition'' at the [[Mitsukoshi]] department store in the [[Nihonbashi]] district of [[Tokyo]]. Based on the 2WD ''G'' model, it had a pink paint scheme with co-ordinated interior, "Princess Kitty" decals on the doors and windows, a ribbon decal on the roof and Hello Kitty-themed headrests. It was eventually sold in a charity auction on behalf of [[UNICEF]].<ref>[http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/07/the-ultimate-kei-mitsubishi-i-hello-kitty-princess-kitty-edit/ "The ultimate kei? Mitsubishi i Hello Kitty 'Princess Kitty' edition"], Alex Nunez, Autoblog.com, [[July 7]] [[2006]]</ref> Other models include the ''i Play edition'', a limited run of 3,000 cars only available in white or black, and featuring a dashboard-mounted slot for an [[iPod nano]],<ref>{{cite web | title = "Mitsubishi Motors lineup" | publisher = Mitsubishi-motors.co.jp | date = [[January 23]] [[2007]] | language = Japanese | url = http://www.mitsubishi-motors.co.jp/pressrelease/j/products/detail1459.html }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Mitsubishi 'i (the eye)' “Play Edition” | publisher = Mitsubishi-motors.co.jp | date = [[May 17]] [[2006]] | language = Japanese | url = http://www.mitsubishi-motors.co.jp/i/lineup/lin_01.html }}</ref> and 100 ''i Kurashiki'' models with [[faux]] [[denim]] [[upholstery]], to be sold at a single Mitsubishi dealership in [[Kurashiki, Okayama]], the [[Prefecture#Japanese_sense_of_prefecture|prefecture]] where the bulk of Japan's domestic [[blue jeans]] manufacturers are located.<ref>[http://www.autoblog.com/2006/12/14/mitsubishi-releases-jeans-themed-i-kurashiki-edition/ "Mitsubishi releases jeans-themed "i" Kurashiki Edition"], Alex Nunez, Autoblog.com, [[December 14]] [[2006]]</ref>
