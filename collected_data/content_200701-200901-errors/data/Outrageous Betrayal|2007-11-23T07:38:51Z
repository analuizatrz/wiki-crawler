'''''Outrageous Betrayal: The Dark Journey of Werner Erhard from est to Exile''''' is a [[non-fiction]] book on [[Werner Erhard]], written by legal [[journalism|journalist]] [[Steven Pressman]]. The book was first published in 1993 by [[St. Martin's Press]], and a second edition was published in 1995 by [[Random House]].<ref name="pressman">{{cite book | last = Pressman | first = Steven | authorlink = Steven Pressman | coauthors = | title = Outrageous Betrayal: The Dark Journey of Werner Erhard from est to Exile | publisher = [[St. Martin's Press]] | date = 1993 | location = [[New York]] | pages = 289 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-312-09296-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Pressman | first = Steven | authorlink = Steven Pressman | coauthors = | title = Outrageous Betrayal: The Dark Journey of Werner Erhard from est to Exile | publisher = [[Random House]] | date = [[April 22]], [[1995]]| location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0517143356}}</ref>  ''Outrageous Betrayal'' book gives an account of Werner Erhard's early life, his exploration of various forms of [[self-improvement]] techniques including [[Scientology]] and [[Mind Dynamics]], and his foundation of [[Erhard Seminars Training]] "est" and later [[Werner Erhard and Associates]] and the est successor course, "The Forum".  Pressman details the quick financial success Erhard had with these companies, as well as controversies relating to litigation involving some former participants in his courses.  The work concludes by going over the impact of a [[March 3]], [[1991]] ''[[60 Minutes]]'' broadcast on [[CBS]] where family members made allegations of abuse against Erhard, and his decision to leave the [[United States]].

The book received positive reviews in ''[[Library Journal]]'', ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' and ''[[Booklist]]'', but ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' questioned why the author did not discuss the methodology of est or the reasons for its popularity and financial success. It has been cited within the [[United States House of Representatives]], as well as in several works on [[psychology]], [[cult]]s and [[new religious movement]]s, for historical background on Erhard and his companies. In 1998, [[Landmark Education]], the successor company to The Forum, attempted to compel Steven Pressman to reveal the unnamed sources he had consulted while researching ''Outrageous Betrayal.'' This matter was later dropped after Landmark Education settled litigation against the [[Cult Awareness Network]] (CAN).  As a result of this settlement, CAN agreed not to sell copies of ''Outrageous Betrayal'' for at least five years after it emerged from [[bankruptcy]].

== Contents ==
In ''Outrageous Betrayal'', Steven Pressman gives a chronological account of Werner Erhard's life and businesses, from high-school years through his formation of companies that delivered [[Large Group Awareness Training|awareness training]] and the later controversies surrounding his business and family life.  The book goes into detail regarding his early life as Jack Rosenberg and his name change to Werner Erhard, his move to [[California]], and the initial inspirations behind the training that would come to be known as "est."  Pressman writes that Erhard was inspired by the [[self-help]] course [[Mind Dynamics]], [[cybernetics]], the book ''[[Think and Grow Rich]]'' by [[Napoleon Hill]], and ''[[Psycho-Cybernetics]]'' by [[Maxwell Maltz]], and by [[Scientology]] and the writings of [[L. Ron Hubbard]].  He also notes how Erhard was helped in the formation of his first awareness training company, [[Erhard Seminars Training]], by an attorney skilled in [[Taxation in the United States|tax law]].<ref name="publishers" /><ref name="library" /><ref name="booklist" />

Pressman notes how Erhard and his businesses became successful within two years of foundation, and writes that his awareness training programs trained over half a million people in his courses and brought in tens of millions of dollars in revenue.  The book then describes controversies relating to both Erhard's businesses and his reported treatment of his family.  Pressman details some of the lawsuits and professional desertions that hurt his business, as well as some of his conflict with the [[Internal Revenue Service]].  The end of the book describes the impact and aftermath of a [[March 3]], [[1991]] ''[[60 Minutes]]'' [[investigative journalism|investigation]] on [[CBS News]], where one of his daughters accused him of [[sexual abuse]].  Pressman also describes the successor company to est, [[Werner Erhard and Associates]], and Erhard's decision to sell the "technology" of Erhard's course The Forum to his employees and leave the [[United States]].<ref name="publishers" /><ref name="library" /><ref name="kirkus" /><ref name="booklist" />

== Reception ==
''Outrageous Betrayal'' received a positive review in ''[[Library Journal]]'', where the book was described as "a compelling account of the 1980s guru who rose from selling used cars to peddling personal transformation."<ref name="library">{{cite journal | last =Annichiarico | first =Mark  | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Outrageous Betrayal: The Dark Journey of Werner Erhard from Est to Exile. | journal =[[Library Journal]] | volume =118 | issue =14 | pages =Page 207 | publisher = | location = | date =[[September 1]], [[1993]] | url =http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/product-description/0312092962 | doi = | id = | accessdate =  2007-11-20}}</ref>  The reviewer recommended [[Public library|public libraries]] carry the book, and that they place it next to [[Wendy Kaminer]]'s ''[[I'm Dysfunctional, You're Dysfunctional]]''.<ref name="library" />  ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' also reviewed the work, and briefly described Pressman's assessment of Werner Erhard.

An analysis in ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' noted the choice of title by the author, and asserted that Pressman: "makes no pretense to objectivity here: His Werner Erhard is a charismatic but abusive con man with a genius for repackaging and marketing others' ideas."<ref name="kirkus">{{cite journal | last =Staff | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Outrageous Betrayal.

==Landmark Education lawsuit==
In 1998, [[Landmark Education]] spent months attempting to compel Steven Pressman to respond to deposition questions aimed at obtaining the  sources he used for research on ''Outrageous Betrayal''.<ref name="skolnik">{{cite news | last = Skolnik | first = Peter L. | coauthors = Michael A.

  | url = http://www.rickross.com/reference/landmark/landmark193.html | accessdate =  2007-10-25}}</ref>  In the "Acknowledgments" section of ''Outrageous Betrayal'', Pressman wrote that he relied upon both named and unnamed sources for information in the book.<ref name="pressman" />  According to a piece published on [[Rick Ross (consultant)|Rick Ross]]'s website "Introduction to the Landmark Education litigation archive", the suit was brought under the pretext of compelling [[Discovery (law)|legal discovery]] for use in Landmark Education's lawsuit against the [[Cult Awareness Network]] (CAN).<ref name="skolnik" />  The piece also asserts that Pressman concluded the [[Deposition (law)|deposition questioning]] was mainly a form of harassment.<ref name="skolnik" />  The piece was written by attorneys Skolnik and Norwick of Lowenstein Sandler PC, who defended Ross ''[[Pro bono publico|pro-bono]]'' in a separate lawsuit initiated by Landmark Education.<ref name="skolnik" />  Skolnik and Norwick cited the discovery commissioner in the Pressman case (who entered an interim order in the matter), as stating that: "..it does not appear that the information sought [from Mr. Pressman] is directly relevant or goes to the heart of the [CAN] action, or that alternative sources have been exhausted or are inadequate."<ref name="skolnik" />
