'''''The Amazing Spider-Man''''' is an [[American comic book]] series published by [[Marvel Comics]], and additionally a spin-off [[The Amazing Spider-Man (TV series)|television program]] and a daily [[newspaper]] [[comic strip]], all featuring the adventures of the [[superhero]] [[Spider-Man]]. 

==Comic book ==
[[Spider-Man]] first appeared in the [[comic book]] ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15 (Aug. 1962). The series was cancelled with that issue, but response to the character was so positive that a solo title, ''The Amazing Spider-Man'', was launched with a March 1963 cover-date.

The character was created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist and co-plotter [[Steve Ditko]], and the pair produced 38 issues of from 1963 to 1966. Since then, many writers and artists have taken over the monthly comic through the years, chronicling the adventures of Marvel's most identifiable hero. 

''The Amazing Spider-Man'' is the character's flagship series. Most of the major characters and villains of the Spider-Man saga have been introduced here, and it is where key events occur. The title was published continuously until 1998 when Marvel Comics relaunched it with a new issue #1 (Jan. 1999), but on Spider-Man's 40th anniversary, this new title reverted to using the numbering of the original series, beginning again with issue #500 (Dec. 2003)

===The 1960s===
The initial years of the book, under Lee and Ditko, chronicled Spider-Man's nascent career with his civilian life as hard-luck yet perpetually good-humored teenager Peter Parker. Parker balanced his career as Spider-Man with his job as a freelance [[photographer]] for ''[[The Daily Bugle]]'' (under the bombastic editor-publisher [[J. Jonah Jameson]]) to help support himself and his frail [[Aunt May]]. At the same time, Parker dealt with public hostility towards Spider-Man and the antagonism of his classmates [[Flash Thompson]] and [[Liz Allan (Marvel Comics)|Liz Allan]] at Midtown High School, while also embarking on a tentative, ill-fated romance with Jameson's secretary, [[Betty Brant]]. 

By focusing on Parker's everyday problems, Lee and Ditko created a groundbreakingly flawed, self-doubting superhero, and the first major teenaged superhero to be a [[protagonist]] and not a [[sidekick]]. Ditko's quirky art provided a stark contrast to the more cleanly dynamic stylings of Marvel's most prominent artist, [[Jack Kirby]], and Ditko's Spider-Man, slightly sinister yet affectionately cartoony,{{Fact|date=January 2008}} combined with the humor and pathos of Lee's writing to lay the foundation for what became an enduring mythos.

Most of Spider-Man's key villains and supporting characters were introduced during this time. Issue #1 (March 1963) featured the first appearances of J. Jonah Jameson and his [[astronaut]] son [[John Jameson]], and the supervillain the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]]. It also included the hero's first encounter with the superhero team [[The Fantastic Four]]. Issue #2 (May 1963) featured the first appearance of [[Vulture (comics)|The Vulture]] and the beginning of Parker's freelance [[photography]] career at the newspaper ''The Daily Bugle''. 
 <!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Af issue 1.jpg|200px|left|thumb|]] -->

The Lee-Ditko era continued to usher in a significant number of villains and supporting characters, including [[Doctor Octopus]] in #3 (July 1963); the [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] and Betty Brant in #4 (Sept. 1963); the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]] in #6 (Nov. 1963); [[Electro (comics)|Electro]] in #9 (March 1964); [[Mysterio]] in #13 (June 1964); the [[Green Goblin]] in #14 (July 1964); [[Kraven The Hunter]] in #15 (Aug. 1964); reporter [[Ned Leeds]] in #18 (Nov. 1964); the  [[Scorpion (comics)|Scorpion]] in #20 (Jan. 1965); and the [[Molten Man]] in #28 (Sept. 1965), an issue that also featured Parker's graduation from high school 

Parker began attending [[Empire State University]] in #31 (Dec. 1965), the issue which also featured the first appearances of friends and classmates [[Gwen Stacy]] and [[Harry Osborn]]. Harry's father, [[Norman Osborn]] first appeared in #23 (April 1965) as a member of Jameson's country club but is not named nor revealed as Harry's father until #37 (June 1966). Probably the most celebrated issue of the Lee-Ditko run{{Fact|date=January 2008}} is #33 (Feb. 1966), the third part of the story arc "If This Be My Destiny", and featuring the dramatic scene of Spider-Man, through force of will and thoughts of family, escaping from being pinned by heavy machinery.

Although credited only as artist for most of his run, Ditko would eventually plot the stories as well as draw them, leaving Lee to script the dialogue. However, a rift between Ditko and Lee developed, and the two men were not on speaking terms long before Ditko completed his last issue, ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' [[Marveldatabase:Amazing Spider-Man 38|#38]] (July 1966). The exact reasons for the Ditko-Lee split have been a source of controversy{{Fact|date=January 2008}} ever since.

In successor penciler [[John Romita Sr.]]'s first issue, #39 (Aug. 1966), archnemesis the Green Goblin discovers Spider-Man's secret identity and reveals his own to the captive hero.  Romita's Spider-Man – more muscular and heroic-looking than Ditko's – became the model for two decades. The Lee-Romita era saw the introduction of such characters as ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' [[managing editor]] [[Joseph "Robbie" Robertson]] in #52 (Sept. 1967) and [[NYPD]] Captain [[George Stacy]], father of Parker's girlfriend [[Gwen Stacy]], in #56 (Jan. 1968). The most important supporting character to be introduced during the Romita era was Mary Jane Watson, who made her first full appearance in #42, (Nov. 1966), although she first appeared  in #25 (June 1965) with her face obscured and had been mentioned since #15 (Aug. 1964). 

Lee and Romita toned down the prevalent sense of antagonism in Parker's world by improving Parker's relationship with the supporting characters and having stories focused as much on the social and college lives of the characters as they did on Spider-Man's adventures. The stories also became more topical, addressing issues such as [[civil rights]], [[racism]], [[prisoners' rights]], the [[Vietnam War]], and political elections.

Issue #50 (June 1967) introduced the highly enduring criminal mastermind the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], who would become a major force as well in the superhero series ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]''. Other notable first appearances in the Lee-Romita era include the [[Rhino]] in #41 (Oct. 1966), the [[Shocker (comics)|The Shocker]] in #46 (March 1967), the [[Prowler (comics)|Prowler]] in #78 (Nov. 1969), and the Kingpin's son, [[Richard Fisk]], in #83 (April 1970).

===The 1970s===
Two spin-off series debuted in the 1970s: ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' in 1972, and ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' in 1976. The flagship title's second decade took a grim turn with a story in #89-90 (Oct.-Nov. 1970) featuring the death of Captain [[George Stacy]]. This was also the first Spider-Man story to be penciled by [[Gil Kane]], who would alternate drawing duties with Romita for the next year-and-a-half and would draw several landmark issues.

One such story took place in the controversial issues #96-98 (May-July 1971). Writer-editor Lee defied the [[Comics Code Authority]] with this story, in which Parker's friend Harry Osborn, was hospitalized after tripping on [[LSD]]. Lee wrote this story upon a request from the US [[Department of Health, Education and Welfare]] for a story about the dangers of drugs. Citing its dictum against depicting drug use, even in an anti-drug context, the CCA refused to put its seal on these issues. With the approval of Marvel publisher [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]], Lee had the comics published without the seal. The comics sold well and Marvel won praise for its socially conscious efforts.{{Fact|date=January 2008}} The CCA subsequently loosened the Code to permit negative depictions of drugs, among other new freedoms. 

The "Six-Arm Saga" of #100-102 (Sept.-Nov. 1971) introduced [[Morbius, the Living Vampire]]. The was the second installment was the first ''Amazing Spider-Man'' story not written by co-creator Lee, with  [[Roy Thomas]] taking over writing the book for several months before Stan Lee returned to write #105-110 (Feb.-July 1972). Lee, who was going on to become Marvel Comics' publisher, with Thomas becoming editor-in-chief, then turned writing duties over to 19-year-old [[wunderkind]] [[Gerry Conway]], who scripted the series through 1975. Romita penciled Conway's first half-dozen issues, which introduced the gangster [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] in #113 (Oct. 1972). Kane then succeeded Romita as penciler, although Romita would continue inking Kane for a time.

The most memorable work of the Conway/Kane/Romita team was #121-122 (June-July 1973), which featured  the death of Gwen Stacy at the hands of The Green Goblin in the story "[[The Night Gwen Stacy Died]]" (#121) shocked readers. Her demise and the Goblin's apparent death one issue later formed a story arc is widely considered as the most defining in the history of Spider-Man. The aftermath of the story also deepened both the characterization of [[Mary Jane Watson]] and her relationship with Parker.

By late 1973, Gil Kane was succeeded by [[Ross Andru]], whose run lasted nearly 60 issues, from 1973 to 1978. Issue #129 (Feb. 1974) introduced the [[Punisher]], who would become one of Marvel Comics' principal and most widely recognized characters. The Conway-Andru era also featured the first appearances of the [[John Jameson (comics)|Man-Wolf]] in #124-125 (Sept.-Oct 1973); the near-marriage of Doctor Octopus and Aunt May in #134 (July 1974); Harry Osborn stepping into his father's role as the Green Goblin in #135-37 (Aug.-Oct. 1974); the the original "[[Clone Saga]]", containing the introduction of [[Ben Reilly|Spider-Man's clone]], in #147]-149 (Aug.-Oct. 1975).

[[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]] and Gil Kane produced the title's 150th issue (Nov. 1975) before [[Len Wein]] became writer for two-and-a-half years.During Wein's tenure, Harry Osborn and Liz Allen dated and became engaged, J. Jonah Jameson was introduced to his eventual second wife, Marla Madison, and Aunt May suffered a heart attack. Wein's last story on ''Amazing'' was a five-issue arc in #176-180 (Jan.-May 1978) featuring a third Green Goblin (Harry Osborn’s psychiatrist, Bart Hamilton). [[Marv Wolfman]], Marvel's editor-in-chief from 1975 to 1976, succeeded Wein as writer, and in his first issue, #182 (July 1978), had Parker propose marriage to Watson (who refused, in the following issue). [[Keith Pollard]] succeeded Ross Andru as artist shortly afterward, and with Wolfman introduced the likable rogue the [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]] (Felicia Hardy) in #194 (July 1979). As a love interest for Spider-Man, the Black Cat would go on to be an important supporting character for the better part of the next decade.

===The 1980s===

''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #200 (Jan. 1980) featured the return and death of the [[Burglar (comics)|burglar]] who killed Spider-Man's Uncle Ben. Writer Marv Wolfman and penciler Keith Pollard both left the title by mid-year, succeeded by [[Dennis O'Neil]], a writer known for groundbreaking 1970s work at rival [[DC Comics]], and penciler [[John Romita, Jr.]]. [[Roger Stern]], who had written nearly 20 issues of sister title ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', took over ''Amazing'' in late 1981. During his two years on the title, Stern augmented the backgrounds of long-established Spider-Man villains, and with Romita Jr. created the mysterious supervillain the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]] in #238-239 (March-April 1983). Fans engaged with the mystery of the Hobgoblin's secret identity, which continued throughout #244-245 and 249-251 (Sept.-Oct. 1983 & Feb.-April 1984).  One lasting changes was the reintroduction of [[Mary Jane Watson]] as a much more serious, mature woman who becomes Peter's confidant after she reveals that she knows his secret identity.

By mid-1984, [[Tom DeFalco]] and [[Ron Frenz]] took over scripting and penciling. DeFalco helped establish the maturation in Parker and Watson's relationship, laying the foundation for the character's eventual wedding. Notably, in #257 (Oct. 1984), Watson tells Parker that she knows he is Spider-Man, and in #259 (Dec. 1984), she reveals to Parker the extent of her troubled childhood. Other notable issues of the DeFalco-Frenz era include #252 (May 1984), with the first appearance of Spider-Man's black costume, which the hero would wear almost exclusively for the next four years' worth of comics; the debut of criminal mastermind the [[Richard Fisk|Rose]], in #253 (June 1984); the revelation in258 (Nov. 1984) that the black costume is a living being, a [[symbiote]]; and the introduction of the female mercenary [[Silver Sable]] in #265 (June 1985).

Tom DeFalco and Ron Frenz were both removed from ''Amazing Spider-Man'' in 1986 by editor Owsley under acrimonious circumstances.<ref>[http://www.digital-priest.com/comics/adventures/frames/spidey.htm Digital Priest] (Owsley official site)</ref> A succession of artists including [[Alan Kupperberg]], [[John Romita, Jr.]], and [[Alex Saviuk]]) penciled the book from 1987 to 1988; Owsley wrote the book for the first half of 1987, scripting the five-part "Gang War" story (#284-288) that DeFalco plotted. Former ''[[Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' writer [[Peter David]] scripted #289 (June 1987), which revealed the late Ned Leeds as being the Hobgoblin (although this was [[retconned]] in 1996 by Roger Stern into Leeds not being the original Hobgoblin after all).

[[David Michelinie]] took over as writer in the next issue, for a story arc in #290-292 (July-Sept. 1987) that led to the marriage of Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson in ''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #21. Issue #298 (March 1988) was the first Spider-Man comic to be drawn by future industry star [[Todd McFarlane]], the first regular artist on ''Amazing Spider-Man'' since the Frenz's departure. McFarlane revolutionized Spider-Man's look. His depiction – large-eyed, with wiry, contorted limbs, and messy, knotted, convoluted webbing – influenced the way virtually all subsequent artists would draw the character. McFarlane's other significant contribution to the Spider-Man canon was the design for what would become one of Spider-Man's most wildly popular antagonists, the [[supervillain]] [[Venom (Eddie Brock)|Venom]]. Issue #299 (April 1988) featured Venom's first appearance (a last-page cameo) before his first full appearance in #300 (May 1988). The latter issue also featured Spider-Man reverting to his original red-and-blue costume.

Other notable issues of the Michelinie-McFarlane era include #312 (Feb. 1989), featuring the Green Goblin vs. the Hobgoblin; and #315-317 (May-July 1989), with the return of Venom. After the editorial and creative turmoil that beset ''Amazing Spider-Man'' in 1987, the Michelinie/McFarlane team at the tail-end of the 1980s restored a sense of creative consistency and quality to the book, and set the tone for Spider-Man for the next decade.{{Fact|date=January 2008}}

===The 1990s===

With a civilian life as a married man, and a re-vamped and re-energised artistic look, the Spider-Man of the 90s was a different superhero from the Spider-Man of the previous three decades. The rise of the comic-book speculation craze of the 90s also impacted on the Spider-Man books. Controversial times lay ahead for Spider-Man, midway through the decade. Following his 1988-1989 run on ''Amazing Spider-Man'', Todd McFarlane left the title to write and draw a new Spidey book, ''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man|Spider-Man]]'', in 1990. McFarlane’s successor on ''Amazing Spider-Man'' was [[Erik Larsen]], who penciled the book from early 1990 to mid 1991. At first, many fans resented the idea of anybody replacing the immensely popular McFarlane. Some objected to Larsen’s “cartoony” style; others labeled him a McFarlane clone. However, Larsen went on to win the readers over, and the book experienced a significant sale increase during his time as artist. Notable issues of the Michelinie/Larsen era include Spidey vs. Venom in #332-333 and 345-347 (May-Jun. 1990 and Mar.-May 1991), the "Return Of The Sinister Six" arc in  #334-339 (Jul.-Sep. 1990), and Spidey vs. [[Doctor Doom]] in  #349-350 (Jul.-Aug. 1991).

After issue #350, Erik Larsen was succeeded by [[Mark Bagley]]. Bagley won The 1986 Marvel Tryout Contest, after which he was assigned a number of low-profile penciling jobs, followed by an acclaimed run on ''[[New Warriors]]'' in 1990. Bagley hit his stride on ''Amazing Spider-Man'', which he penciled from 1991 to 1996, and is considered to be the definitive Spider-Man artist of the 1990s, due in no small part to his rendition of Spider-Man being used extensively for most Spider-Man licensed merchandise of the 1990s onwards. The first notable story arc of the Michelinie/Bagley era on ''Amazing'' was the first appearance of a second symbiote nemesis for Spider-Man: the “spawn of Venom,” [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]], in #361-363 (Apr.-Jun. 1992). #365, commemorating Spidey’s 30th anniversary (Aug. 1992) was a double-sized, hologram-cover issue with the cliffhanger ending of Peter Parker’s parents, long-believed to be dead, showing up alive. It would be close to two years before they were revealed to be imposters, and killed off, in #388 (Apr. 1994). This was David Michelinie’s last issue as writer of ''Amazing Spider-Man''. His 1987-1994 stint gave him the record of having the second-longest run as writer on the title, behind Stan Lee. In retrospect, the David Michelinie era of ''Amazing Spider-Man'' was a mixed bag. It undoubtedly contained many highlights, but at the same time, it ushered in and fostered an era characterised by a noticeable proliferation of hype over substance: specifically, too many appearances by Venom (and Carnage), more splashy battles than solid storytelling, and several multiple-part stories with guest stars/crossovers with other Marvel books. Additionally, the protracted development, and contrived resolution, of the saga of Spider-Man’s parents would prove to be a harbinger of the controversial "[[Clone Saga]]".

With #389, [[J.M. DeMatteis]] took over as writer (his previous Spider-Man credits included the controversial "[[Kraven's Last Hunt]]" story arc in 1987, and a 1991-1993 run on ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]''). DeMatteis immediately imbued a grim psychological tone into ''Amazing Spider-Man'', with the conclusion of the "Pursuit" crossover in #389 (May 1994) and the "Shrieking" story arc of #390-393 (Jun.-Sep. 1994). Spider-Man, at this point, was a noticeably darker and more brooding character than he had ever been before (it is possible that the creative team behind the Spider-Man books wanted readers to feel more sympathy for Peter’s recently re-introduced clone, [[Ben Reilly]], than for Peter, so they could more readily accept the idea of Ben replacing Peter as Spider-Man). From October 1994 to June 1996, ''Amazing'' stopped running stories exclusive to the title and merely ran installments of multi-part stories that crossed over into all the Spider-Man books. One of the few self-contained stories during this period was #400 (Apr. 1995), which featured the death of Aunt May (although the death was later revealed to have been faked). The "Clone Saga" culminated with the revelation that the Spider-Man who had appeared in the previous 20 years of comics was a clone of the real Spider-Man (this plot twist was massively unpopular with readers, and was later reversed in the "Revelations" story arc that crossed over the Spider-Man books in Dec. 1996). The Clone Saga tied into a publishing gap after #406 (Oct. 1995), when the title was temporarily replaced by ''The Amazing Scarlet Spider'' #1-2 (Nov.-Dec. 1995), featuring Ben Reilly. The series picked up again with #407 (Jan. 1996), with Tom DeFalco returning as the book’s writer (for a run which, by his own admission, did not compare to his 1984-1986 stint). By September 1996, Mark Bagley had completed his 5½-year run as artist on ''Amazing Spider-Man''. A succession of artists (including [[Ron Garney]], [[Steve Skroce]], [[Joe Bennett]] and [[Rafael Kayanan]]) penciled the book until November 1998, by which time Marvel had decided to bring the curtain down on ''Amazing Spider-Man'' and "reboot" the title. The "last" issue of ''Amazing Spider-Man'' was #441, cover-dated Nov. 1998.

===The reboot, and beyond===
[[Image:MJPARKER.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Cover art for ''The Amazing Spider-Man (vol. 2)'' #51.<br>Art by [[J. Scott Campbell]].]]
Marvel began ''Amazing Spider-Man'' anew with issue #1 in January 1999. [[Howard Mackie]] wrote the first 29 issues; with #30 (Jun. 2001), [[J. Michael Straczynski]] took over as writer (issue #30 also began the dual numbering with Vol.1 numbering (#471) in addition to Vol. 2 numbering on the cover; '''NOTE''': most Marvel Comics titles published at that time were given the dual numbering on the front cover, bearing the current volume numbering with the previous volume's numbering had the previous volume not been stopped). In October 2000, John Romita, Jr. had succeeded [[John Byrne]] as artist. Issue #58 (Nov. 2003) was the final issue of “Volume 2” of ''Amazing Spider-Man''; the title reverted back to its original numbering for #500 (Dec. 2003) (with Vol. 2, #1-58 considered as #442-499 of the original run.). [[Mike Deodato, Jr.]] penciled the book from mid-2004 until 2006.

===9/11 Issue===

''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #36 (#477) explores how Spider-Man and other heroes react to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].  The issue was written by [[J. Michael Straczynski]] and penciled by [[John Romita, Jr]]. It starts with a double page spread of the devastation and of Spidey holding his head in pain/anguish/disbelief, his only word "...God..." as well as a few brief thoughts of the act. The issue continues as Spider-Man swings down to help in the aftermath. Joining with other heroes in the rescue efforts, Spider-Man explores the wreckage and the broken hearts and his thoughts drive on, thinking through it all. At some point his thoughts become Straczynski's reflections and response. The script journeys from horror, pain and loss to end on strength. The story was notable for spotlighting the firefighters sifting through the wreckage, keeping the heroes assisting them few. The emphasis on "real life" heroes is most apparent on the last page, in a full-page splash wherein the super heroes seen in that issue stood in the background, and New York City firefighters and other city workers involved in helping during the events of 9/11 stood in the foreground.

===Civil War===

The 2006 ''[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]'' crossover includes ''The Amazing Spider-Man.'' Spider-Man originally fights alongside Iron Man and the government to fulfill the [[Superhuman Registration Act]], capturing superheroes and jailing them until they register and reveal their identities. Spider-Man reveals his secret identity as Peter Parker to the world, but eventually realizes he is on the wrong side and, along with Captain America, becomes an opponent of the registration.

===Back In Black===
As of issue #539, almost immediately following the Civil War, Aunt May is shot by an unnamed assassin hired by the Kingpin to kill Peter. Peter dodged and knocked Mary Jane down but was unable to save Aunt May, who is badly injured. Peter takes Aunt May to the hospital, leaving instructions with Mary Jane on what to do.  He then retrieves the long forgotten black costume to send a new message: when he finds who shot his aunt, he is going to kill them. He then discovers the name of the man who shot her, Jake Martino. As they were fighting, Peter demanded he tell him who hired him. Before he could get the name out, he was shot by an unknown assailant. Peter tracks down the shooter of Jake and discovers he works with the Kingpin. Spider-Man then proceeds to hunt down Fisk and promises to kill him. Utterly defeating Fisk in combat, Peter stops short of killing him, revealing that due to the fact their fight was witnessed by an entire prison's worth of witnesses, word will soon spread about Spider-Man's total defeat of Kingpin, and for a man who wants people to believe he's unbeatable, his reputation is everything. Peter promises to kill Fisk immediately after May dies, since it was Kingpin's order to shoot. Peter then tells the inmates to spread the word around the underworld that if anyone targets his family, he ''will'' kill them.

While ''Back in Black'' promotions from Marvel stated that this was his first time back in the black costume in twenty years, he made two brief returns to the costume in 1991's ''Spider-Man'' volume 1, #13, to battle Morbius the Living Vampire and in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #19 battling Venom which was the issue Brock's wife committed suicide.

===One More Day===

{{main|Spider-Man: One More Day }}

[[Image:ASM545COV 150.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Cover for ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #545, the final issue of Spider-Man's marriage. Art by [[Joe Quesada]].]]
[[Spider-Man: One More Day|''One More Day'']] is a four-part crossover, written partially by [[J. Michael Straczynski]] and illustrated by [[Joe Quesada]], running through September's ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #544, November's  ''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #24 and ''Sensational Spider-Man'' #41, and December's ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #545. The cross-over issues will be the final issues for the ''Neighborhood'' and ''Sensational'' titles, as they will be replaced by additional monthly issues of ''Amazing Spider-Man'' beginning in December. Quesada apparently discarded many of Straczynski's ideas for the final two issues of the story arc, and injected his own plot points into the story due to Straczynski's refusal to coincide with what was agreed upon at summit meetings and e-mails. Largely due to disagreement with the Brand New Day story alignment and continuity woes.

In the story, Peter and Mary Jane are in a local hospital with Aunt May on her death bed.  May's doctor recognizes Peter and says that he will do all that he can so as not to raise suspicion to the rest of the hospital.  Meanwhile, Peter goes to confront Tony Stark, begging him to help cure May, which he refuses, as that would be aiding and abetting a known criminal and any links to him would injure his reputation from the [[Civil War (comic book)|Superhero Civil War]].  Tony then changes his mind and gives his aide [[Jarvis]] a check for 2 Million dollars to pay May's hospital bill.  The doctor regretfully informs Peter that currently there is nothing humanly possible that they can do to cure May.  Peter replies, "Maybe not in your world, but with the crowd I hang out with..."  He then dons his traditional Red-and-Blue costume and goes off to see Dr. Strange. Dr. Strange tries to help Peter see that the most important thing is to be with May when she passes. Peter rejects this and ends up meeting [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]. He tells Peter that the bargain is simple: He will save May in exchange for Peter and Mary Jane's marriage. He tells them the deal expires at midnight and lets the couple talk it over. 

Peter and MJ grappled with their unspeakable choice, and Peter explained he couldn't live with himself if Aunt May died as a result of his own actions (unmasking during ''Civil War''), but also could not face life without MJ, or make the decision without her.  As Mephisto confronted the Parkers near midnight, MJ impulsively stepped forward and told the demon that "the answer is yes!"  Peter was shocked, and MJ made Mephisto promise to restore Spider-Man's secret identity which he agreed to do without question.  She also asked to put his life back as it was and have a chance at happiness.  Mephisto asked why he should do that, and MJ answered that it was because of what she could offer him.  MJ whispered something to Mephisto, striking a devil's bargain, and then urged Peter to "save May.  Be the hero.  Be my hero."

An anguished Peter finally agreed to Mephisto's deal, and as a clock began to chime midnight and magic swirled around the Parkers, they saw a vision of their daughter that would now never be.  A steely Mary Jane held Peter and explained that she knew in her heart of hearts that they were always meant to be together, and that whatever Mephisto tries to do, "it doesn't matter.  Because whatever he does to pull us apart would have to be bigger and stronger than what ''brought'' us together and ''kept'' us together, no matter what happened.  And there's no power in the universe big enough for a job like that.  Not the Devil, not God, not ''anybody.''"  Mary Jane embraced Peter and promised that they would find their way back to each other and be together again.  The Parkers swore their love, and as the clock struck twelve, they kissed, and Mary Jane whispered the famous line, "face it, tiger...you just hit the jackpot."

After Mephisto's spell took hold and morning rose, Peter awoke alone.  He appeared to be single, and still living with a whole and hearty Aunt May.  At the close of ''One More Day'', he attended a party for the newly-resurrected [[Harry Osborn]] (now apparently alive as a result of Mephisto's changes to the fabric of reality), where he glimpsed Mary Jane among the other guests.  [[Flash Thompson]] asked if things were "still frosty" between Peter and MJ, and an unwitting Peter, no longer remembering his life with his wife, just looked at Mary Jane Watson quizzically, watching her leave the party early...and alone.

===Brand New Day===
Following "One More Day", Marvel has planned a "back to basics" approach to Spider-Man which will see ''Amazing Spider-Man'' ship three times per month. [http://www.newsarama.com/Comic-Con_07/Marvel/SpiderTable.html] There will be four creative teams initially consisting of [[Dan Slott]] and [[Steve McNiven]], [[Bob Gale]] and [[Phil Jiminez]], [[Marc Guggenheim]] and [[Salvador Larroca]], and [[Zeb Wells]] and [[Chris Bachalo]]. Each creative team will be producing a story arc released 3 issues per month. Editor Steve Wacker said in an interview with [[Newsarama]] "I'll be rotating the artists and writers so it's not always the same". Also the Mysterious [[Jackpot (Marvel Comics)|Jackpot]] will be making her 'Brand New Day Debut'.

==Other media==

The 2004 movie ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' was at one point tentatively titled ''The Amazing Spider-Man'', as was the upcoming animated series ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (animated series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]''.  In addition, ''Amazing Spider-Man'' has been used as a title in the following:

===Television program===
{{main|The Amazing Spider-Man (TV series)}}
Spidey got his shot at live-action TV stardom in April 1977, when he debuted in the ''Amazing Spider-Man'' TV series.  [[Nicholas Hammond]] portrayed Peter Parker/Spider-Man in the short-lived series, which had started out as a series of TV-movies, obviously made to capitalize on the ''[[The Incredible Hulk]]'' television series.  The show was canceled a year after its debut.

===Radio Series===
In 1995 BBC Radio commissioned a Spider-Man 'audio book' which aired on BBC Radio 1 over 50 episodes on week days between January 15th 1996 and March 24th 1996.  The performance was co-produced by [[Brian May]] who also contributed to the musical arrangement and wrote and performed the theme tune.

The scope of the story included a number of familiar characters from the Spider-Man comic books as well as key figures from the Marvel 'Heroes' universe such as [[Fantastic Four]], [[Namor the Submariner]] and [[Doctor Doom]].

The role of Spider-Man was performed by [[William Dufries]].  Also included in the cast list was [[Anita Dobson]], famous for her role as [[Angie Watts]] in BBC's serial drama ''[[EastEnders]]''.

===Newspaper comic strip===<!-- This section is linked from [[Spider-Man]] -->

The daily newspaper comic strip began on [[January 3]], [[1977]]. It was first written by Spider-Man co-creator [[Stan Lee]] and illustrated by [[John Romita, Sr.|John Romita]].  The strip was surprisingly successful in an era with few serialized adventure strips.  The strip slowly grew in circulation and [[as of 2007]] is still being published.  Lee's brother [[Larry Lieber]] illustrated and later wrote the strip for much of its run. In 1992, [[Paul Ryan (comics)|Paul Ryan]] took over the penciling (with [[Joe Sinnott]] inking) on the Sunday version of the strip, and drew that feature for just over three years. While the strip and the comic book feature the same characters, they do not share the same [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]], and the strip has had a decreased emphasis on [[supervillain]] enemies.  A rare exception was the 1987 wedding of [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] and [[Mary Jane Watson]] which occurred in both the comic book and the comic strip.  Guest stars in the newspaper strip include [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], [[Daredevil (comics)|Daredevil]] and [[Dr. Strange]].  Villains include [[Dr. Doom]], [[Kraven the Hunter]], and [[The Rhino]].  Stories from the strip have been reprinted in paperback and in'' [[Comics Revue]]'' magazine.

===Video and computer games===
{{see details|Spider-Man video games}}
Numerous video and computer games have been released whereby the player controlled Spider-Man and had to do battle with various enemies.
