The '''County of Mark''' ({{lang-de|Grafschaft Mark}}, colloquially known as ''Die Mark'') was a [[county]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in the [[Lower Rhenish-Westphalian Circle]]. It lay on both sides of the [[Ruhr|Ruhr River]] along the [[Volme]] and [[Lenne]] Rivers.

The Counts of the Mark were some of the most powerful and influential [[Westphalia]]n lords in the Holy Roman Empire. The name ''Mark'' is recalled in the [[Märkischer Kreis]], a district in lands north of the [[Ruhr]] River in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Germany]]. The northern portion (north of the [[Lippe River]]) is still called '''Hohe Mark''' ("Higher Mark"). The former "Lower Mark" (between the Ruhr and Lippe Rivers) is — for the most part — the present [[Ruhr area]] and is no longer called "Mark".

== Geography ==
[[Image:Blaeu 1645 - Comitatus Marchia et Ravensberg.jpg|right|thumb|County of the Mark and Ravensberg, 1645.]]
The County of the Mark enclosed an area of approximately 3,000 km² and extended between the [[Lippe River|Lippe]] and [[Agger River]]s (north-south) and between [[Gelsenkirchen]] and [[Bad Sassendorf]] (west-east) for about 75 km.

The east-west flowing [[Ruhr]] separated the county in two different regions: the northern, fertile lowlands of [[Hellweg]]-[[Börde]]; and the southern hills of the Süderbergland ([[Sauerland]]). In the south-north direction the southern part of the county was crossed by the Lenne. In the region of the Lower Lenne was the County of Limburg (1243-1808), a fiefdom of [[Berg (state)|Berg]].

The seat of the Counts of the Mark was originally the [[Burg Altena]] in Sauerland, but they moved to  [[Burg Mark]] near [[Hamm]] in the 1220s. The county was bordered by [[Vest Recklinghausen]], the [[Dortmund|County of Dortmund]], the [[Bishopric of Münster]], the [[County of Limburg]], [[Werden Abbey]], and [[Essen Abbey]].

==Coat of arms==
[[Image:Counts of Mark Arms.svg|thumb|100px|left|Coat of arms]]
The [[coat of arms]] of the county was a red and white checkered [[fess]] of three rows on a gold field. These arms are used today by the city of [[Hamm]]. Many other places in the area include the red and white checkered fess in their arms as a reference to the county.

== History ==
[[Image:Grafschaft mark 1681 sanson.jpg|thumb|right|County of Mark in 1681.]]
Originally belonging to a collateral line of the counts of [[Berg (state)|Berg]], the territory emerged under the name of '''Berg-Altena''' in 1160. The Counts of Altena then purchased [[Burg Mark]] ("Oberhof Mark") near [[Hamm]] from the Counts of Rüdenberg and made it the residence of the new "Counts of the Mark". The town of [[Hamm]] near Burg Mark was founded by Count [[Adolf I, Count of the Mark|Adolf I]] in [[1226]] and was soon the most important town of the county. ''Mark'' was the German word for a border [[marches|march]].

In the [[Battle of Worringen]] (1288), Count [[Eberhard I, Count of the Mark|Eberhard I]] fought on the side of the [[Duchy of Brabant]] and the County of Berg. He fought against his liege, Archbishop [[Sigfried II von Westerburg]] (in his capacity as Duke of Westphalia). Because Brabant and its allies were victorious, the County of Mark gained supremacy in southern Westphalia and became independent of the [[Archbishopric of Cologne]]. The territory of Mark was for long restricted to the lands between the Ruhr and Lippe rivers ("Lower Mark"). New territories in the north ("Higher Mark") were gained during the 14th century in wars against the [[Prince-bishops of Münster]].

Count [[Adolf III, Count of the Mark|Adolf III]], the son of [[Adolf II, Count of the Mark|Adolf II]] married [[Margarete of Cleves]], acquired the [[Duchy of Cleves]] on the western banks of the [[Rhine]] in 1368 and united it with Mark as "Cleves-Mark" in 1394.

The heir to the throne of Cleves-Mark married the daughter of the Duke of Berg in 1510, resulting in a [[personal union]] of Cleves-Mark and Berg (1521). Almost all of present [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] (except for the clerical states) was then ruled by the dukes. The ducal dynasty became extinct in 1609, when the insane last duke had died. A long dispute about the succession followed, before the territory was granted to Elector [[John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg|John Sigismund]] of [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] in the 1614 [[Treaty of Xanten]] (generally accepted in 1666). It then became part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] after 1701.

In 1807 the County of the Mark passed from Prussia to [[First French Empire|France]] in the [[Treaties of Tilsit]]. In 1808 [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] then gave Mark to the elevated [[Grand Duchy of Berg]], which was divided into four [[Departments of France|departments]] along the lines of Napoleonic France. Mark was in the Ruhr Department until the collapse of French power in 1813, when it returned to Prussia.

The Prussian administrative reform of [[30 April]] [[1815]] placed Mark within Regierungsbezirk Arnsberg, [[Province of Westphalia]]. The Hohenzollern Prussian sovereigns remained Counts of the "Prussian County of the Mark" until 1918.
The "County of the Mark" has no official meaning anymore, but is used to informally refer to the region in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]].
