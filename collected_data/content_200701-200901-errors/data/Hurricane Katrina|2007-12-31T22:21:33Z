'''Hurricane Katrina''' was the costliest and one of the five deadliest [[Tropical cyclone|hurricanes]] in the history of the [[United States]].<ref name="KatrinaTCR">{{cite web|last=Knabb|first=Richard D|coauthors=Rhome, Jamie R.; Brown, Daniel P|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-AL122005_Katrina.pdf|format=PDF|title=Tropical Cyclone Report: Hurricane Katrina: 23-30 August 2005|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|date=[[December 20]], [[2005]]; updated [[August 10]], [[2006]]|accessdate=2006-05-30}}</ref> It was the sixth-strongest [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] [[Atlantic hurricane|hurricane]] ever recorded and the third-strongest hurricane on record that made landfall in the United States. Katrina formed on [[August 23]] during the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season]] and caused devastation along much of the north-central [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]]. The most severe [[Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans|loss of life and property damage]] occurred in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], which flooded as the [[levee]] system catastrophically failed, in many cases hours after the storm had moved inland.<ref name="TPInteractive"/> The hurricane caused severe destruction across the entire [[Mississippi]] coast and into [[Alabama]], as far as 100&nbsp;miles (160&nbsp;km) from the storm's center. Katrina was the eleventh tropical storm, fifth hurricane, third [[Tropical cyclone#Classifications.2C terminology.2C and naming|major hurricane]], and second [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 5 hurricane]] of the 2005 Atlantic season.

It formed over the [[Bahamas]] on [[August 23]], [[2005]], and crossed southern [[Florida]] as a moderate [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 1 hurricane]], causing some deaths and flooding there, before strengthening rapidly in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and becoming one of the strongest hurricanes on record while at sea. The storm weakened before making its second and third landfalls as a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 3]] storm on the morning of [[August 29]] in southeast Louisiana and at the Louisiana/Mississippi state line, respectively.

The storm surge caused severe damage along the Gulf Coast, devastating the Mississippi cities of [[Waveland, Mississippi|Waveland]], [[Bay St. Louis, Mississippi|Bay St. Louis]], [[Pass Christian, Mississippi|Pass Christian]], [[Long Beach, Mississippi|Long Beach]], [[Gulfport, Mississippi|Gulfport]], [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]], [[Ocean Springs]], and [[Pascagoula, Mississippi|Pascagoula]]. In Louisiana, the [[Flood Control Act of 1965|federal flood protection]] system in New Orleans failed in more than 50 places. Nearly every levee in metro New Orleans breached as Hurricane Katrina passed east of the city, subsequently flooding 80% of the city and many areas of neighboring [[list of parishes of Louisiana|parishes]] for weeks.<ref name="TPInteractive">{{cite web|last=Swenson|first=Dan D|coauthors=Marshall, Bob|url=http://www.nola.com/katrina/graphics/credits.swf|format=SWF|title=Flash Flood: Hurricane Katrina's Inundation of New Orleans, August 29, 2005|publisher=[[Times-Picayune]]|date=[[May 14]], [[2005]]|}}</ref>

At least 1,836 people lost their lives in Hurricane Katrina and in the subsequent floods, making it the deadliest U.S. hurricane since the [[1928 Okeechobee Hurricane]]. The storm is estimated to have been responsible for $81.2 billion (2005 [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]]) in damage, making it the costliest natural disaster in [[History of the United States|U.S. history]]. The catastrophic failure of the flood protection in New Orleans prompted immediate review of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] since the agency has by [[Flood Control Act of 1965|congressional mandate]] sole responsibility for design and construction of the flood protection. There was also widespread criticism of the federal, state and local governments' reaction to the storm and resulting in an investigation by the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] and the resignation of [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] director [[Michael D. Brown]]. Conversely, the [[National Hurricane Center]] and [[National Weather Service]] were widely commended for accurate forecasts and abundant lead time.<ref name="CongressInvestigation"/>

==Storm history==
{{main|Meteorological history of Hurricane Katrina}}
{{storm path|Katrina 2005 track.png}}

Hurricane Katrina formed as Tropical Depression Twelve over the southeastern Bahamas on [[August 23]], [[2005]] as the result of an interaction of a [[tropical wave]] and the remains of [[List of 2005 Atlantic hurricane season storms#Tropical Depression Ten|Tropical Depression Ten]]. The system was upgraded to [[Tropical cyclone#Intensity classifications|tropical storm status]] on the morning of [[August 24]] and at this point, the storm was given the name ''[[Katrina]].'' The tropical storm continued to move towards Florida, and became a hurricane only two hours before it made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] between [[Hallandale Beach, Florida|Hallandale Beach]] and [[Aventura, Florida]] on the morning of [[August 25]]. The storm weakened over land, but it regained hurricane status about one hour after entering the [[Gulf of Mexico]].<ref name="KatrinaTCR" />

The storm [[rapid deepening|rapidly intensified]] after entering the Gulf, partly because of the storm's movement over the warm [[sea surface temperature|waters]] of the [[Loop Current]].<ref>Leben, Robert; Born, George; Scott, Jim. "[http://www.colorado.edu/news/releases/2005/358.html CU-Boulder Researchers Chart Katrina's Growth In Gulf Of Mexico]." ''[[University of Colorado at Boulder]].'' [[September 15]], [[2005]]. Retrieved on [[2006-06-05]].</ref> On [[August 27]], the storm reached Category 3 intensity on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]], becoming the third [[Tropical cyclone#Categories and ranking|major hurricane]] of the season. An [[eyewall#Eyewall replacement cycles|eyewall replacement cycle]] disrupted the intensification, but caused the storm to nearly double in size. Katrina again rapidly intensified, attaining Category 5 status on the morning of [[August 28]] and reached its peak strength at 1:00 p.m. CDT that day, with maximum sustained winds of 175&nbsp;mph (280&nbsp;km/h) and a minimum central [[atmospheric pressure|pressure]] of 902&nbsp;[[Bar (unit)|mbar]]. The pressure measurement made Katrina the fourth most intense [[Atlantic hurricane]] on record at the time, only to be surpassed by Hurricanes [[Hurricane Rita|Rita]] and [[Hurricane Wilma|Wilma]] later in the season; it was also the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Gulf of Mexico at the time (a record also later broken by [[Hurricane Rita|Rita]]).<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/>

Katrina made its second landfall at 6:10 a.m. CDT<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/> on [[August 29]] as a Category 3 hurricane with sustained winds of 125&nbsp;mph (205&nbsp;km/h) near [[Buras-Triumph, Louisiana]]. At landfall, hurricane-force winds extended outward 120&nbsp;miles (190&nbsp;km) from the center and the storm's central pressure was 920&nbsp;mbar. After moving over southeastern Louisiana and [[Breton Sound]], it made its third landfall near the Louisiana/Mississippi border with 120&nbsp;mph (195&nbsp;km/h) sustained winds, still at Category 3 intensity.<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/>

Katrina maintained strength well into Mississippi, finally losing hurricane strength more than 150&nbsp;miles (240&nbsp;km) inland near [[Meridian, Mississippi]]. It was downgraded to a tropical depression near [[Clarksville, Tennessee]], but its remnants were last distinguishable in the eastern [[Great Lakes]] region on [[August 31]], when it was absorbed by a [[Surface weather analysis#cold front|frontal boundary]]. The resulting [[extratropical]] storm moved rapidly to the northeast and affected [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]].<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/>

During video conferences involving the President on [[August 28]] and 29, the director of the [[National Hurricane Center]] at the time, [[Max Mayfield]], expressed concern that Katrina might push its storm surge over the city's levees and flood walls. In one conference, he stated, "I do not think anyone can tell you with confidence right now whether the levees will be topped or not, but that's obviously a very, very great concern."<ref name="Levee Breach Warning">{{cite news | url = http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/03/02/fema.tapes/index.html | title = Transcripts, tape show Bush, Brown warned on Katrina | date= March 2, 2006 | accessdate = 2007-04-22 | publisher = CNN.com}}</ref>

On [[August 28]], as the sheer size of Katrina became clear, the NHC extended the tropical storm warning zone to cover most of the Louisiana coastline and a larger portion of the [[Florida Panhandle]]. The [[National Weather Service]]'s New Orleans/Baton Rouge office issued a [[National Weather Service bulletin for New Orleans region|vividly-worded bulletin]] predicting that the area would be "uninhabitable for weeks" after "devastating damage" caused by Katrina, which at that time rivaled the intensity of [[Hurricane Camille]].<ref>"[http://www.srh.noaa.gov/data/warn_archive/LIX/NPW/0828_214001.txt NWS bulletin]."

Voluntary and mandatory evacuations were issued for large areas of southeast [[Louisiana]] as well as coastal [[Mississippi]] and [[Alabama]]. About 1.2 million residents of the Gulf Coast were covered under a voluntary or mandatory evacuation order.<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/>

====Emergency declarations====
In a September 26, 2005 hearing, Michael Brown was questioned by Republican members of Congress about FEMA's response.

On [[August 26]], the state of Mississippi activated its [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] in preparation of the storm's landfall. Additionally, the state government activated its Emergency Operations Center the next day, and local governments began issuing evacuation orders. By 7:00 p.m. [[EDT]] on [[August 28]], 11 counties and eleven cities issued evacuation orders, a number which increased to 41 counties and 61 cities by the following morning.

By [[August 26]], the possibility of unprecedented cataclysm was already being considered. Many of the computer models had shifted the potential path of Katrina {{convert|150|mi|km|-1}} westward from the Florida Panhandle, putting the city of [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] right in the center of their track probabilities; the chances of a direct hit were forecast at 17%, with strike probability rising to 29% by [[August 28]].<ref>"[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/prb/al122005.prblty.015.shtml Hurricane Katrina Probabilities Report Number 15]," & "[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/prb/al122005.prblty.021.shtml Hurricane Katrina Probabilities Report Number 21]."

Many people living in the area were unaware when Katrina strengthened from a tropical storm to a hurricane in one day and struck southern [[Florida]] near the [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade]] – [[Broward County, Florida|Broward]] county line. The hurricane struck between the cities of [[Aventura, Florida|Aventura]], in Miami-Dade County, and [[Hallandale, Florida|Hallandale]], in Broward County, on [[August 25]], [[2005]]. However, [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC) forecasts had correctly predicted that Katrina would intensify to hurricane strength before landfall, and [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|hurricane watches and warnings]] were issued 31.5 hours and 19.5 hours before landfall, respectively — only slightly less than the target thresholds of 36 and 24 hours.<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/>

Florida Governor [[Jeb Bush]] declared a [[state of emergency]] on [[August 24]] in advance of Hurricane Katrina's landfall in Florida.

A June 2007 expert report stated that two-thirds of the flooding were due to levee breaches [http://www.asce.org/static/hurricane/whitehouse.cfm]. The storm surge also devastated the coasts of [[Mississippi]] and [[Alabama]], making Katrina the most destructive and costliest [[natural disaster]] in the history of the [[United States]], and the deadliest hurricane since the [[1928 Okeechobee Hurricane]].

Although Hurricane Katrina stayed well to the north of [[Cuba]], on [[August 29]] it brought tropical-storm force winds and rainfall of over 8&nbsp;inches (200&nbsp;mm) to western regions of the island. Telephone and power lines were damaged and around 8,000 people were evacuated in the [[Pinar del Río Province]]. According to Cuban television reports the coastal city of Surgidero de Batabano was 90% underwater.<ref name="Cuba damage">Staff Writer.

On [[August 29]] Hurricane Katrina made landfall near [[Buras, Louisiana]] with 125&nbsp;mph (205&nbsp;km/h) winds, as a strong Category 3 storm. However, as it had only just weakened from Category 4 strength and the radius of maximum winds was large, it is possible that sustained winds of Category 4 strength briefly impacted extreme southeastern Louisiana. Although the storm surge to the east of the path of the eye in [[Mississippi]] was higher, a very significant surge affected the Louisiana coast. The height of the surge is uncertain because of a lack of data, although a tide gauge in [[Plaquemines Parish]] indicated a storm tide in excess of 14&nbsp;feet (4.3&nbsp;m) and a 12&nbsp;foot (3&nbsp;m) storm surge was recorded in [[Grand Isle, Louisiana|Grand Isle]].<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/>

Hurricane Katrina also brought heavy rain to Louisiana, with 8 – 10&nbsp;inches (200 – 250&nbsp;mm) falling on a wide swath of the eastern part of the state. In the area around [[Slidell, Louisiana|Slidell]], the rainfall was even higher, and the highest rainfall recorded in the state was approximately 15&nbsp;inches (380&nbsp;mm). As a result of the rainfall and storm surge the level of [[Lake Pontchartrain]] rose and caused significant flooding along its northeastern shore, affecting communities from Slidell to [[Mandeville, Louisiana|Mandeville]]. Several bridges were destroyed, including the [[I-10 Twin Span Bridge]] connecting Slidell to [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]].<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/> Almost 900,000 people in Louisiana lost power as a result of Hurricane Katrina.<ref name="Power failures">Staff Writer.

Hard-hit [[St. Bernard Parish]] was flooded due to breaching of the levees that contained a navigation channel called the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet (MR-GO). The search for the missing was slow. According to an interview in the ''[[New Orleans Times-Picayune]]'', the coroner was still trying to get a list of missing from the [[Red Cross]] in November 2005. While there were some victims on this list whose bodies were found in their homes, the vast majority were tracked down through word-of-mouth and credit card records. As of December 2005, the official missing list in the Parish stood at 47.<ref>Cannizaro, Steve.

As the eye of Hurricane Katrina swept to the northeast, it subjected the city to hurricane conditions for hours. Although power failures prevented accurate measurement of wind speeds in New Orleans, there were a few measurements of hurricane-force winds. From this the NHC concluded that it is likely that much of the city experienced sustained winds of Category 1 or Category 2 strength.

Katrina's storm surge led to 53 levee breaches in the [[Flood Control Act of 1965|federally built levee system]] protecting metro New Orleans. Failures occurred in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] and surrounding communities especially St. Bernard Parish. The [[Mississippi River Gulf Outlet]] (MR-GO) breached its levees in approximately 20 places, flooding much of east New Orleans, most of [[Saint Bernard Parish, Louisiana|Saint Bernard Parish]] and the East Bank of [[Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana|Plaquemines Parish]]. The major levee breaches in the city included breaches at the [[17th Street Canal]] levee, the [[London Avenue Canal]], and the wide, navigable [[Industrial Canal]], which left approximately 80% of the city flooded.<ref>Murphy, Verity.

Most of the major roads traveling into and out of the city were damaged. The only routes out of the city were the westbound [[Crescent City Connection]] and the Huey P.

The Gulf coast of [[Mississippi]] suffered massive damage from the impact of Hurricane Katrina on [[August 29]], leaving 238&nbsp;people dead, 67&nbsp;missing, and billions of dollars in damage: bridges, barges, boats, piers, houses and cars were washed inland.<ref name=HBrecov>{{cite web | title =Information Relating to the Federal Appropriations for Katrina Recovery|date = [[January 6]], [[2006]] | accessdate = 2006-09-27 | author = Haley Babour | publisher = Office of the Governor, Mississippi | url = http://www.governorbarbour.com/Recovery/news/2006/jan/information.html}}</ref>
Katrina traveled up the entire state, and afterwards, all 82 counties in Mississippi were declared disaster areas for federal assistance, 47 for full assistance.<ref name=HBrecov/>

After making a brief initial landfall in [[Louisiana]], Katrina had made its final landfall near the state line, and the eyewall passed over the cities of [[Bay St. Louis, Mississippi|Bay St. Louis]] and [[Waveland, Mississippi|Waveland]] as a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 3]] hurricane with sustained winds of 120&nbsp;mph (195&nbsp;km/h).<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/> Katrina's powerful right-front quadrant passed over the west and central Mississippi coast causing a powerful 27&nbsp;foot (8.2&nbsp;m) [[storm surge]], which penetrated 6&nbsp;miles (10&nbsp;km) inland in many areas and up to 12&nbsp;miles (20&nbsp;km) inland along bays and rivers; in some areas, the surge crossed [[Interstate 10]] for several miles.<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/> Hurricane Katrina brought strong winds to Mississippi which caused significant tree damage throughout the state. The highest unofficial reported wind gust recorded from Katrina was one of 135&nbsp;mph (217&nbsp;km/h) in [[Poplarville, Mississippi|Poplarville]], in [[Pearl River County, Mississippi|Pearl River County]].<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/>

[[Image:Hurricane katrina damage gulfport mississippi.jpg|thumb|left|Damage to [[Long Beach, Mississippi]] following Hurricane Katrina]]
The storm also brought heavy rains with 8 – 10&nbsp;inches (200 – 250&nbsp;mm) falling in southwestern Mississippi and rain in excess of 4&nbsp;inches (100&nbsp;mm) falling throughout the majority of the state. Katrina caused eleven tornadoes in Mississippi on [[August 29]], some of which damaged trees and power lines.<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/>

Battered by wind, rain and storm surge, some beachfront neighborhoods were completely leveled. Preliminary estimates by Mississippi officials calculated that 90% of the structures within half a mile of the coastline were completely destroyed,<ref name="CBS Miss">Staff Writer.

More than half of the 13 casinos in the state, which were floated on barges to comply with Mississippi land-based gambling laws, were washed hundreds of yards inland by waves.<ref name="CBS Miss"/>

A number of streets and bridges were washed away. On [[U.S. Highway 90]] along the Mississippi Gulf Coast, two major bridges were completely destroyed: the [[Bay St. Louis, Mississippi|Bay St. Louis]] - [[Pass Christian, Mississippi|Pass Christian]]<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/> bridge, and the [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]] - [[Ocean Springs, Mississippi|Ocean Springs]] bridge. In addition, the eastbound span of the I-10 bridge over the [[Pascagoula River]] estuary was damaged. In the weeks after the storm, with the connectivity of the coastal U.S. Highway 90 shattered, traffic traveling parallel to the coast was reduced to two lanes on the remaining I-10 span.

All three coastal counties of the state were severely affected by the storm. Katrina's surge was the most extensive, as well as the highest, in the documented history of the United States; large portions of both [[Hancock County, Mississippi|Hancock]], [[Harrison County, Mississippi|Harrison]], and [[Jackson County, Mississippi|Jackson]] Counties were inundated by the storm surge, in all three cases affecting most of the populated areas.<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] | title = Mississippi Hurricane Katrina Surge Inundation and Advisory Base Flood Elevation Map Panel Overview | date= November 2005 | accessdate = 2006-07-16 | format = PDF | publisher = FEMA|url = http://www.fema.gov/pdf/hazard/flood/recoverydata/katrina/ms_overview.pdf}}</ref> Surge covered almost the entire lower half of Hancock County, destroying the coastal communities of [[Clermont Harbor, Mississippi|Clermont Harbor]] and [[Waveland, Mississippi|Waveland]], much of [[Bay St. Louis, Mississippi|Bay St. Louis]], and flowed up the Jourdan River, flooding [[Kiln, Mississippi|Kiln]]. In Harrison County, [[Pass Christian]] was completely inundated, along with a narrow strip of land to the east along the coast, which includes the cities of [[Long Beach, Mississippi|Long Beach]] and [[Gulfport, Mississippi|Gulfport]]; the flooding was more extensive in communities such as [[D'Iberville]], which borders Back Bay. [[Biloxi]], on a peninsula between the Back Bay and the coast, was particularly hard hit, especially the low-lying Point Cadet area. In Jackson County, storm surge flowed up the wide river [[estuary]], with the combined surge and freshwater flooding cutting the county in half. Remarkably, over 90% of [[Pascagoula, Mississippi|Pascagoula]], the easternmost coastal city in Mississippi, and about {{convert|75|mi|km|0}} east of Katrina's landfall near the Louisiana-Mississippi border, was flooded from surge at the height of the storm. Other large Jackson County neighborhoods such as Porteaux Bay and Gulf Hills were severely damaged with large portions being completely destroyed, and [[St. Martin, Mississippi|St. Martin]] was hard hit; [[Ocean Springs, Mississippi|Ocean Springs]], [[Moss Point, Mississippi|Moss Point]], [[Gautier, Mississippi|Gautier]], and [[Escatawpa]] also suffered major surge damage.

Mississippi Emergency Management Agency officials also recorded deaths in [[Forrest County, Mississippi|Forrest]], [[Hinds County, Mississippi|Hinds]], [[Warren County, Mississippi|Warren]], and [[Leake County, Mississippi|Leake]] counties.

An [[oil rig]] under construction along the [[Mobile River]] broke its moorings and floated 1.5&nbsp;miles (2&nbsp;km) northwards before striking the [[Cochrane Bridge]] just outside Mobile. No significant damage resulted to the bridge and it was soon reopened. The damage on [[Dauphin Island]] was severe, with the surge destroying many houses and cutting a new canal through the western portion of the island. An offshore oil rig also became grounded on the island.

Katrina also had a profound impact on the environment. The storm surge caused substantial [[Coastal erosion|beach erosion]], in some cases completely devastating coastal areas. In [[Dauphin Island]], approximately 90&nbsp;miles (150&nbsp;[[km]]) to the east of the point where the hurricane made landfall, the sand that comprised the [[barrier island]] was transported across the island into the [[Mississippi Sound]], pushing the island towards land.<ref>{{cite web | author = [[United States Geological Survey]] | date = [[September 14]], [[2005]] | url = http://coastal.er.usgs.gov/hurricanes/katrina/lidar/dauphin-island.html | title = Daupin Island - Pre- and Post-Storm 3D Topography | work = Hurricane Katrina Impact Studies | publisher = [[USGS]] | accessdate = 2006-06-05}}</ref> The storm surge and waves from Katrina also obliterated the [[Chandeleur Islands]], which had been affected by [[Hurricane Ivan]] the previous year.<ref>{{cite web | author = [[United States Geological Survey]] | date = [[September 14]], [[2005]] | url = http://coastal.er.usgs.gov/hurricanes/katrina/photo-comparisons/chandeleur.html | title = Before and After Photo Comparisons: Chandeleur Islands | work = Hurricane Katrina Impact Studies|publisher = [[USGS]] | accessdate = 2006-06-05}}</ref>

Within the [[United States]] and as delineated in the [[National Response Plan]], disaster response and planning is first and foremost a local government responsibility. When local government exhausts its resources, it then requests specific additional resources from the county level. The request process proceeds similarly from the county to the state to the federal government as additional resource needs are identified. Many of the problems that arose developed from inadequate planning and back-up communications systems at various levels.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

Some [[disaster recovery]] response to Katrina began before the storm, with [[Federal Emergency Management Agency of the United States|Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) preparations that ranged from logistical supply deployments to a [[mortuary]] team with refrigerated trucks. A network of volunteers began rendering assistance to local residents and residents emerging from New Orleans and surrounding parishes as soon as the storm made landfall, and continued for more than six months after the storm.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

===Criticism of government response===

{{main|Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina}}
The criticisms of the government's response to Hurricane Katrina primarily consisted of condemnations of [[Administrative incompetence|mismanagement]] and lack of [[leadership]] in the relief efforts in response to the storm and its aftermath. More specifically, the criticism focused on the delayed response to the flooding of [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], and the subsequent state of chaos in the Crescent City.<ref name="thevenot">Thevenot, Brian; Russell, Gordon.

Within days of Katrina's [[August 29]], [[2005]] landfall, public debate arose about the local, state and federal governments' role in the [[Preparations for Hurricane Katrina|preparations]] for and response to the hurricane. [[Criticism]] was prompted largely by televised images of visibly shaken and frustrated political leaders and of residents who remained in New Orleans without [[drinking water|water]], [[food]] or [[shelter]]. The deaths of citizens by [[thirst]], [[exhaustion]], and [[violence]] days after the storm itself had passed also fueled the criticism, as did the treatment of people who had been evacuated to facilities such as the [[Superdome]]. Others alleged that [[race]], [[social class|class]], and other factors could have contributed to delays in government response. The percentage of black victims among storm-related deaths (49%)<ref name=LaDHH>{{cite web | title = Updated Number of Deceased Victims Recovered Following Hurricane Katrina | date = [[December 9]], [[2005]] | accessdate = 2006-08-01 | publisher = Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals|url = http://www.dhh.state.la.us/news.asp?Detail=758}}</ref> was below their proportion in the area's population (approx. 60%<ref>"[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/08/18/national/main1913712.shtml?source=RSS&attr=U.S._1913712 New Orleans population statistics]."

).

The government was accused of making things worse, instead of making things better, by preventing help by others while delaying its own response. In accordance with federal law, President [[George W. Bush]] directed the [[Secretary of Homeland Security|Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security]], [[Michael Chertoff]], to coordinate the Federal response. Chertoff designated [[Michael D. Brown]], head of the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]], as the Principal Federal Official to lead the deployment and coordination of all federal response resources and forces in the Gulf Coast region. However, the President and Secretary Chertoff initially came under harsh criticism for what some perceived as a lack of planning and coordination. Eight days later, Brown was recalled to Washington and Coast Guard Vice Admiral [[Thad W. Allen]] replaced him as chief of hurricane relief operations.<ref>Meserve, Jeanne; Barrett, Ted.

On [[September 2]], [[2005]], during a [[benefit concert]] for Hurricane Katrina relief on [[NBC]], ''[[A Concert for Hurricane Relief]]'', [[Kanye West]] was a featured speaker. Controversy arose when West was presenting, as he deviated from the prepared script:

<blockquote>''I hate the way they portray us in the media. You see a black family, it says, 'They're looting.' You see a white family, it says, 'They're looking for food.' And, you know, it's been five days &#91;waiting for federal help&#93; because most of the people are black. And even for me to complain about it, I would be a hypocrite because I've tried to turn away from the teacher-the TV because it's too hard to watch. I've even been shopping before even giving a donation, so now I'm calling my business manager right now to see what is the biggest amount I can give, and just to imagine if I was down there, and those are my people down there. So anybody out there that wants to do anything that we can help — with the way America is set up to help the poor, the black people, the less well-off, as slow as possible. I mean, the Red Cross is doing everything they can. We already realize a lot of people that could help are at war right now, fighting another way — and they've given them permission to go down and shoot us!''</blockquote>

[[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]], with whom West was paired to present, spoke next and continued as normal by reading the script. Once it was West's turn to speak again, West delivered the controversial phrase:

{{cquote|''[[George W. Bush|George Bush]] doesn't care about [[black people]].''}}

Although the camera quickly cut away to [[Chris Tucker]], West's comments still reached the East Coast broadcasts, and was replayed or discussed afterwards.

Kanye West and Mike Myers met again on a brief sketch on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', in which Myers joked that since the telethon, the government has stripped him of his American citizenship ("still got my Canadian citizenship to fall back on," Myers joked), and placed him under heavy government surveillance.

Criticism from politicians, activists, pundits and journalists of all stripes was directed at the local and state and governments headed by Mayor [[Ray Nagin]] of New Orleans and Louisiana Governor [[Kathleen Blanco]]. Nagin and Blanco were criticized for failing to implement New Orleans' evacuation plan and for ordering residents to a shelter of last resort without any provisions for food, water, security, or sanitary conditions. Perhaps the most important criticism of Nagin was that he delayed his [[emergency evacuation]] order until 19&nbsp;hours before landfall, which led to hundreds of deaths of people who (by that time) could not find any way out of the city.<ref name="CongressInvestigation"/>

The destruction wrought by Hurricane Katrina raised other, more general public policy issues about [[emergency management]], [[environmental policy]], [[poverty]], and [[unemployment]]. The discussion of both the immediate response and of the broader public policy issues may have affected [[elections]] and [[legislation]] enacted at various [[Executive (government)|levels of government]]. The storm's devastation also prompted a Congressional investigation, which found that FEMA and the Red Cross "did not have a logistics capacity sophisticated enough to fully support the massive number of Gulf coast victims." Additionally, it placed responsibility for the disaster on all three levels of government.<ref name="CongressInvestigation"/>

An [[ABC News]] [[Opinion poll|Poll]] conducted on [[September 2]], [[2005]], showed slightly more blame was being directed at state and local governments (75%) than at the Federal government (67%), with 44% blaming President Bush's leadership directly.<ref name="abcnewspoll">Langer, Gary.

Despite receiving aid from around the world, there was also a heavy dose of criticism from around the world including accusations of racism that were revealed at the international level across global press. Quotations from the UK Mirror such as "Many things about the United States are wonderful, but it has a vile underbelly which is usually kept well out of sight.

===Non-governmental organization response===
The [[American Red Cross]], [[Southern Baptist Convention]], [[Salvation Army]], [[Oxfam]], [[Common Ground Collective]], [[Emergency Communities]], [[Habitat for Humanity]], Service International, "A River of Hope" and many other charitable organizations provided help to the victims of the storm. They were not allowed into New Orleans proper by the National Guard for several days after the storm because of safety concerns. These organizations raised $4.25 billion ([[United States dollar|USD]]) in donations by the public, with the Red Cross receiving over half of the donations.<ref name = "Charity Navigator report">{{ cite web | author = Staff writer|publisher= [[Charity Navigator]] | title = Where Did The Money Go? | date= 2006 | accessdate = 2006-08-05 | work = Hurricane Katrina: One Year Later | url = http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm/bay/katrina.main.htm}}</ref>

During and after the Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma and Rita, the [[American Red Cross]] had opened 1,470 different shelters across and registered 3.8 million overnight stays. A total of 244,000 Red Cross workers (95% of which were non-paid volunteers) were utilized throughout these three hurricanes. In addition, 346,980 comfort kits (such as toothpaste, soap, washcloths and toys for children) and 205,360 clean up kits (containing brooms, mops and bleach) were distributed. For mass care, the organization served 68 million snacks and meals to victims of the disasters and to rescue workers. The Red Cross also had their Disaster Health services meet 596,810 contacts, and Disaster Mental Health services met 826,590 contacts. Red Cross emergency financial assistance was provided to 1.4 million families. Hurricane Katrina was the first natural disaster in the United States that the American Red Cross utilized their "Safe and Well" family location website.<ref name="ARC 1 yr">{{cite web | publisher = [[American Red Cross]] | title = A Year of Healing |date=August 2006 | date = [[2006-09-29]] | url = http://www.redcross.org/images/pdfs/Katrina_OneYearReport.pdf}}</ref><ref name = "ARC 2005AHS facts">{{cite web | publisher = [[American Red Cross]] | title = Hurricane Season 2005: Facts and Figures | date = [[June 30]], [[2006]]|date = [[2006-09-29]] | url = http://www.redcross.org/news/ds/hurricanes/2005/facts.html}}</ref>

In the year following Katrina's strike on the Gulf Coast, The [[Salvation Army]] allocated donations of more than $365&nbsp;million to serve more than 1.7&nbsp;million people in nearly every state. The organization's immediate response to Hurricane Katrina included more than 5.7 million hot meals, 8.3 million sandwiches, snacks & drinks. Its SATERN network of amateur radio operators picked up where modern communications left off to help locate more than 25,000&nbsp;survivors. Salvation Army pastoral care counselors were on hand to comfort the emotional and spiritual needs of 277,000 individuals. As part of the overall effort, Salvation Army officers, employees and volunteers contributed more than 900,000&nbsp;hours of service.<ref name="Salvation Army">{{cite web | url = http://www.salvationarmyusa.org/usn%5Cwww_usn.nsf/vw-news/FB0167FE449EC0C4802571D8004B5FEE | title = Salvation Army Reflects on Largest Disaster Response Ever at One-Year Anniversary of Hurricane Katrina | accessdate = 2006-08-28|date = [[August 28]], [[2006]] | publisher = [[Salvation Army|The Salvation Army]]}}</ref>

===Analysis of New Orleans levee failures===
{{main|2005 levee failures in Greater New Orleans}}
A June 2007 report released by the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] states that the failures of the federally built levees in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans']] were found to be primarily the result of system design flaws.<ref> http://www.asce.org/static/hurricane/whitehouse.cfm</ref> The [[US Army Corps of Engineers]] who by [[Flood Control Act of 1965|federal mandate]] is responsible for the conception, design and construction of the region's flood-control system failed to pay sufficient attention to public safety.

According to new modeling and field observations by a team from [[Louisiana State University]], the [[Mississippi River Gulf Outlet]] (MRGO), a 200-meter (660&nbsp;ft) wide canal designed to provide a shortcut from New Orleans to the Gulf of Mexico, helped provide a funnel for the storm surge, making it 20% higher and 100%-200% faster as it crashed into the city. St. Bernard Parish, one of the more devastated areas, lies just south of the MRGO. The [[Army Corps of Engineers]] disputes this causality and maintains Katrina would have overwhelmed the levees with or without the contributing effect of the MRGO.<ref>Warrick, Joby; Grunwald, Michael. "[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/23/AR2005102301200_pf.html Investigators Link Levee Failures to Design Flaws]." ''[[Washington Post]].'' [[October 24]], [[2005]]. Retrieved on [[2006-06-05]].</ref>

On [[April 5]], [[2006]], months after independent investigators had demonstrated that levee failures were not caused by natural forces beyond intended design strength, Lieutenant General Carl Strock testified before the United States Senate Subcommittee on Energy and Water that "We have now concluded we had problems with the design of the structure."<ref>Staff Writers "[http://www.unregisterednews.com/content/view/184/53/ Problems with the design of levees]." ''[[Unregistered News]].'' [[September 29]], [[2005]]. Retrieved on [[2007-05-25]].</ref> He also testified that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers did not know of this mechanism of failure prior to [[August 29]], [[2005]]. The claim of ignorance is refuted, however, by the National Science Foundation investigators hired by the Army Corps of Engineers, who point to a 1986 study by the Corps itself that such separations were possible in the I-wall design.<ref>{{cite news| title = Corps chief admits to 'design failure' | author = Walsh, Bill | publisher = [[Times Picayune]]|date = [[April 06]], [[2006]] | accessdate=2006-04-09 | url = http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/frontpage/index.ssf?/base/news-5/1144306231230500.xml}}</ref>

Various [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] began floating around that the levees were in fact deliberately demolished. A number of New Orleans residents described hearing "explosions" coming from the Industrial Canal levee in the Lower 9th Ward before the floodwaters rushed in. A National Guard worker claims he was sworn to secrecy upon finding explosives residue at the site of the break.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/orleans_levees.html|title=New Orleans Levees Were Blown In 1927}}</ref>

===Media involvement===
{{main|Media involvement in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina}}
[[Image:Geraldo-Rivera-Katrina-Aftermath-FNC.jpg|thumb|[[Geraldo Rivera]] reporting from the New Orleans Convention Center on [[September 2]], [[2005]].]]
Many representatives of the [[news media]] reporting on the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina became directly involved in the unfolding events, instead of simply reporting. Because of the loss of most means of communication, such as land-based and cellular telephone systems, field reporters in many cases became conduits for information between victims and authorities.

The authorities, who monitored local and network news broadcasts, as well as internet sites, would then attempt to coordinate rescue efforts based on the reports. One illustration was when [[Geraldo Rivera]] of [[Fox News]] tearfully pleaded for authorities to either send help or evacuate the thousands of evacuees stranded at the [[Ernest N. Morial Convention Center]].<ref>"[http://www.ifilm.com/ifilmdetail/2678976 Geraldo Rivera & Shepard Smith Unleashed]." &mdash; ''Video.'' 2005. Retrieved on [[2006-06-05]].</ref>

The storm also brought a dramatic rise in the role of [[Website|Internet sites]] - especially [[blogging]] and community journalism. One example was the effort of ''NOLA.com'', the web affiliate of New Orleans' ''[[The Times-Picayune|Times-Picayune]]'', which was awarded the Breaking News [[Pulitzer Prize]],<ref name="Pulitzer BN">{{cite web | author = The Pulitzer Board | title = 2006 Pulitzer Prize Winners - Breaking News Reporting | date= 2006 | accessdate = 2006-08-02 | url = http://www.pulitzer.org/year/2006/breaking-news-reporting/}}</ref> and shared the Public Service Pulitzer with the Biloxi-based ''[[The Sun Herald|Sun Herald]]''.<ref name="Pulitzer PS">{{cite web | author = The Pulitzer Board | title = 2006 Pulitzer Prize Winners - Public Service | date= 2006 | accessdate = 2006-08-02 | url = http://www.pulitzer.org/year/2006/public-service/}}</ref> The newspaper's coverage was carried for days only on NOLA's blogs, as the newspaper lost its presses and evacuated its building as water rose around it on August 30. The site became an international focal point for news by local media, and also became a vital link for rescue operations and later for reuniting scattered residents, as it accepted and posted thousands of individual pleas for rescue on its blogs and forums. NOLA was monitored constantly by an array of rescue teams - from individuals to the Coast Guard - which used information in rescue efforts. Much of this information was relayed from trapped victims via the SMS functions of their cell phones, to friends and relatives outside the area, who then relayed the information back to NOLA.com. The aggregation of community journalism, user photos and the use of the internet site as a collaborative response to the storm attracted international attention, and was called a watershed moment in journalism.<ref name="OJR NOLA">{{cite web | author = Mark Glaser | title = NOLA.com blogs and forums help save lives after Katrina | date = [[September 13]], [[2005]] | publisher = Online Journalism Review | accessdate = 2006-08-02 | url = http://www.ojr.org/ojr/stories/050913glaser/}}</ref> In the wake of these online-only efforts, the Pulitzer Committee for the first time opened all its categories to online entries.<ref name="Pulitzer speech">{{cite web | author = [[Paul Steiger]] | title = Remarks at Pulitzer Prize luncheon|date = [[May 22]], [[2006]] | accessdate = 2006-08-02 | publisher = The Pulitzer Board | url = http://www.pulitzer.org/resources/steigerspeech.html}}</ref>

As the U.S. military and rescue services regained control over the city, there were restrictions on the activity of the media. On [[September 9]], the military leader of the relief effort announced that reporters would have "zero access" to efforts to recover bodies in New Orleans. Immediately following this announcement, [[CNN]] filed a [[lawsuit]] and obtained a temporary [[restraining order]] against the ban. The next day the government backed down and reversed the ban.<ref name="Media Ban">Staff Writer. "[http://edition.cnn.com/2005/LAW/09/10/katrina.media/ U.S. won't ban media from New Orleans searches]." ''[[CNN]].'' [[September 11]], [[2005]]. Retrieved on [[2006-06-05]].</ref>

Hurricane Katrina has also been the centerpiece of several documentary films including [[Spike Lee]]'s film, ''[[When the Levees Broke]]'', and [[Darren Martinez]]'s film, ''Hellp''.<ref>Britt, M. "Las Vegas Teen Helps Hurricane Victims In New Orleans", ''Las Vegas Daily Optic'', [[December 19]], [[2005]],</ref>

===Retirement===
{{seealso|List of retired Atlantic hurricane names}}
Because of the large loss of life and property along the [[Gulf Coast]], the name Katrina was officially retired on [[April 6]], [[2006]] by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] at the request of the U.S. government. It was replaced by Katia on List III of the [[Lists of tropical cyclone names#North Atlantic|Atlantic hurricane naming lists]], which will next be used in the [[2011 Atlantic hurricane season]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2006/s2607.htm|title = Dennis, Katrina, Rita, Stan, and Wilma "Retired" from List of Storm Names|accessmonthday = [[August 28]]|accessyear = 2006|date = [[April 6]], [[2006]]|publisher = NOAA}}</ref>
