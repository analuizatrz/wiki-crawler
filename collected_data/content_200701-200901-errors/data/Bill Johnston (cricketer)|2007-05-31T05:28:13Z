Born in [[Beeac]], near [[Colac, Victoria|Colac]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Johnston's [[bowler (cricket)|bowling]] was one of the spearheads of [[Donald Bradman|Don Bradman's]] undefeated 1948 touring team which was well known as ''[[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|The Invincibles]]''.

== Early years ==
Johnston took up cricket from an early age, playing with his elder brother Allan throughout the year on a backyard pitch on the family’s dairy farm. Beeac’s local team, which competed in the Colac District Association, occasionally had difficulty in assembling a full side. As a result, Johnston made his debut aged only twelve alongside his brother after an invitation from his schoolteacher. On debut, when a draw became a foregone conclusion, Johnston was allowed to bowl the final over, taking a wicket maiden. The following season, the brothers led Beeac’s attack, continuing to do so after moving to Colac High School, where Bill became captain of the cricket and football teams and head prefect. Johnston left school at sixteen, working in Colac, before following Allan to Melbourne in 1939. He joined Richmond Cricket Club in the Third XI and took 6/16. After five games he was promoted to the Second XI, and made his first grade debut in the last game of the 1939/40 season. The following season, when nineteen, he was selected for [[Victorian Bushrangers|Victoria]]’s [[Sheffield Shield]] match against [[Queensland Bulls|Queensland]], but the [[Pearl Harbor attacks]] forced the cancellation of competitive cricket. Johnston joined the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] along with his brother, serving for four years as a radar technician in northern Australia. His brother died after crashing in [[Ireland]].<ref name="wisden">{{cite web| title= Wisden 1949 - William Johnston |url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154626.html| year= [[1949]] |accessdate=2007-05-25| publisher=-[[Wisden]]}}</ref><Ref name="az">{{cite book | last = Cashman, Franks, Maxwell, Sainsbury, Stoddart, Weaver, Webster | year = 1997 | title = The A-Z of Australian cricketers|pages =??}}</ref>

==First class and Test debut ==
Prior to the [[Second World War]], Johnston was a slow-medium and [[left arm orthodox]] bowler, but during a practise session, he bowled a quicker ball to [[Jack Ryder]] a former Australian captain, Victorian selector and Test batsman. This prompted Ryder to wage a personal campaign to induce Johnston to become a pace bowler. Upon the resumption of first class cricket in 1945-46, Johnston made his Shield debut and entrusted with the responsibility of opening the attack. He felt that the fast bowling was only for short periods with the new ball, and that he would be allowed to revert to spin bowling as the ball became older.<ref name="wisden"/><ref name="az"/>

As opportunities for slow bowling became infrequent, he contemplated retirement. Although he dismissed [[Cyril Washbrook]] in the first over for Victoria against [[Wally Hammond]]'s touring [[England cricket team|England team]] of 1946-47, he was skeptical about his pace bowling, until with further encouragement from Australian captain [[Don Bradman]]. Bradman told Johnston that the selectors thought highly of his potential as a medium-fast bowler to reinforce the short bursts of pace spearheads [[Ray Lindwall]] and [[Keith Miller]]. Johnston practised his pace bowling with new vigour, and at the start of the 1946-47 season, took an opening burst of 3/0 for Victoria against the touring [[Indian cricket team]]. He was rewarded with selection for four of the five Tests against India, heading the averages with 16 wickets at 11.37. He took 5/48 in the second Test and 6/77 in the third. This ensured him selection for the 1948 tour of England as part of Bradman’s Invincibles.<ref name="wisden"/><ref name="az"/>

== Invincibles tour ==
During the Ashes tour, Johnston roomed with Richmond and Victorian team-mate [[Doug Ring]]. As Ring was a [[leg spin]] bowler, they were in direct competition for a place in the XI. Traditionally Australia had fielded their intended first choice in the tour opener against [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]]. When Johnston was omitted in favour of Ring, it appeared he would not be in Bradman’s Test plans. Bradman changed his mind on the morning of the First Test in [[Trent Bridge]] when rain was forecast. Johnston was played in the hope of exploiting a wet wicket.<ref name="haigh">http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/295893.html</ref> He showed his by bowling a total of 84 overs to help Australia grind out a victory.<ref name="cobit">http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/295739.html</ref> After taking 5/36 in 25 overs in the first innings and scoring 17,<ref name="testlist">http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/295739.html</ref>  Johnston bowled 59 overs in the second to take 4/147 as Lindwall was unable to bowl to injury. He scored his Test best of 29 before taking match figures of 4/105 as Australia took a 2-0 lead in the Second Test at Lord’s. In an effective containing performance, Johnston took 3/67 in the first innings of the Third Test at [[Old Trafford]] in 45.5 overs. After taking a combined 5/181 in the Fourth Test victory, he rounded of the series with match figures of 6/60 in the Fifth Test at [[The Oval]] from 43.3 overs, completing the 4-0 series result with an innings victory.<ref name="haigh"/>

In both the Test and county matches during the 1948 tour, Johnston carried the heaviest workload, bowling nearly 200 overs more than any other member of the squad. He was the leading wickettaker with more than 100 wickets. His best performances in the tour games included a match haul of 10/40 against [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]] at [[Bradford]], bowling finger spin on a wet pitch, 8/68 against [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]] and 11/117 against [[Hampshire County Cricket Club]]. After carrying a heavy workload in the early stages of the tour, he was used more sparingly in the latter stages. As the tour progressed Johnston improved his control as he restrained England’s batsmen between the new ball bursts of Lindwall and Miller. He finished with 27 wickets, equal to Lindwall. Johnston finished the season at the top of the first-class bowling averages and was chosen as one of [[Wisden Cricketer's Almanack|Wisden's]] [[Wisden Cricketer of the Year|Five Cricketers of the Year]].<ref name="wisden"/><ref name="az"/>

== Later career ==
He fell asleep at the wheel in [[Durban]] at the start of the tour following a team function and crashed his car, suffering head injuries. The team manager was informed that Johnston was in danger of dying, with Johnston describing his injury as a”nine-iron divot in the top of my skull”.<ref name="guard"/><ref name="vic"/> His best innings figures were 6/44 in the second innings of the First Test against [[South African cricket team|South Africa]] at Johannesburg. It was a successful tour for Johnston, who took 23 wickets at 17.04.<ref name="cobit"/> After taking three wickets in the Second Test victory at [[Cape Town]], he was more prominent in the Third at Durban with match figures of 8/114 as Australia took the series 3-0. An ineffective 1/68 saw the Fourth Test drawn before he finished with 3/22 in the Fifth Test in [[Port Elizabeth]]. He ended with 23 wickets at 17.04.<ref name="testlist"/>

The 1950-51 series against England was Johnston’s first home series since the Invincibles tour. He lead the wicket takers, with 22 at 19.18. He took match figures of 7/65, 6/54, 1/81 and 7/131 as Australia took the first four Tests. His worst performance of 1/91 coincided with Australia’s only loss in the Fifth Test.<ref name="testlist"/>

The 1951-52 home series was the first ever against the West Indies, and Johnston again lead the wicket takers with 23 at 22.08 as Australia won the series 4-1. This time Johnston’s best match performance of 6/62 and 1/50 came in the only loss in the Third Test at [[Adelaide]]. This happened when Hassett was a late withdrawal due to injury, leaving Australia with a unbalanced team with only four specialist batsmen who could not consolidate the work done by the five specialist bowlers. It was in this match that Johnston passed 100 Test wickets, the fastest player to do so. He also managed a contribution og 28 in the Second Test to complement five wickets in the match. Johnston was at the peak of his career. In his 24 Tests to the end of the series, he had taken 111 wickets at 19.22, with Australia winning 19 and losing two. (move 4th Test with Ring here)
Johnston could not maintain his form in the 1952-53 home series against South Africa. Although he took 21 wickets in five Tests, they came at a cost of 35.1. This coincided with a 2-2 result. Australia’s first series non-victory since 1932-33 [[Bodyline]] series. Again Johnston’s best individual performances came in Australia’s less productive matches: He took seven wickets in the last two Tests, which Australia drew and lost.<ref name="testlist"/>

He missed the first six first-class matches, before recovering to play in the First Test at Trent Bridge. He was economical but unpenetrative, conceding 36 runs in 36 overs without taking a wicket. He took 4/161 in the Second Test before injury intervened again. A haul of 6/63 against Glamorgan<ref>Benaud, ''Anything But'' p.79</ref> saw his return for the Fifth Test at [[The Oval]]. A total of 84 overs in the match yielded 3/146, and Johnston was unable to prevent the victory which saw England reclaim the Ashes. He managed seven Test wickets at 49, but in first class matches took 75 wickets at 20.54.<ref name="vic">http://premier.cricketvictoria.com.au/page/johnston_william_arras.html</ref><ref name="testlist"/>  

The 1954-55 series against England was to be Johnston’s last Test success. He took 19 wickets at 22.26 in the first four Tests before missing the last through injury as England took the series 3-1. Again his least effective performance of 3/106 corresponded with Australia’s only victory of the series in the First Test. He took match figures of 6/126 and 6/111 (including a second innings of 5/85) as Australia lost the next two Tests, before taking 4/80 in what was to be his last Test on home soil.<ref name="testlist"/>

His career ended unhappily on Australia’s first tour to the West Indies. He took 2/126 in the First Test in Kingston, Jamaica. These were to be his last Test wickets as he took 0/60 in the Second in Trinidad. He was retained for the Third Test but injured himself while fielding and neither batted nor bowled. He was rested for the Fourth but returned for the Fifth. On the first day his knee failed as he attempted to catch a [[Clyde Walcott]] pull shot.<ref name="vic"/> He was carried from the ground and his Test career ended without bowling or batting in either of his last two matches.<ref name="testlist"/>

Johnston reached 100 test wickets in four years, then a record for any bowler. <ref name="smh"/>

== Style==

Standing 188 cm, Johnston utilised a flowing ten-pace approach to the wicket, with an idosyncratic dip of his head before  delivery. He had success on moist English pitches, with deliveries from over the wicket because of the increased chances of [[leg before wicket]] decisions and to induce edges from balls angling across the batsmen. His stock ball swings into the right-hander, but he mixes this with an away swinger. The late swing in flight which generated the batsman's uncertainty over the direction in which the ball would move was responsible for the majority of Johnston’s wickets in England. Although his pace was lower than that generated by Lindwall or Miller, he was noted for his accuracy and ability to revert to spin bowling on sticky wickets. His right ankle had to be bound tightly in order to prevent jarring from his awkward delivery. Johnston was a keen student of the game, and although he did not see a state match until his debut,  and watched only one Test before his debut, he supplemented his knowledge by reading cricket books. During his early first-class career, upon returning from matches, he would read articles by Bradman, [[Bert Oldfield]] and [[Arthur Mailey]] from a book given to him years by his schoolteacher. Bradman rated him as “Australia’s greatest left-hand bowler”, ahead of the likes of [[Alan Davidson (cricketer)|Alan Davidson]]. [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] described him as “the finest team man and tourist” in cricket and valued his personality.<ref name="wisden"/><ref name="az"/>

Johnston had a reputation as a poor batsman, but averaged in the 11-12 range in Tests and first class matches, despite not being able to make a half century. He headed the averages in England in 1953, being not out 16 times out of 17 and averaging 102. He attributed this to “a lot of application, concentration and dedication”, stating that “ class always tells”<ref> [[Daily Telegraph]] Obituary Saturday 26th May 2007</ref>. When Hassett realised that Johnston was atop the batting averages, he told Johnston to tell the opposing captain of this fact and ask them to refrain from dismissing him.<ref name="haigh"/> in the  last match against T. N. Pearce’s XI at [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], English Test paceman [[Alec Bedser]] bowled wide of the stumps and advised Johnston not to do anything that lose him his wicket.<ref name="times">http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article1842406.ece</ref>

In Melbourne in 1952, he partnered [[Doug Ring]] in a last wicket partnership of 38 which sealed an Australian victory by one wicket.<ref name="az"/>

==Life after cricket==

Johnston had a varied career after cricket holding a variety of jobs including sporting goods sales representative, shoe company marketing manager, publican and apartment building manager. Prior to his retirement, he ran a [[post office]] on the [[Gold Coast]] of [[Queensland]].

He married Judy and they had two sons David and Peter. When he married Judy at St. Paul’s Anglican Cathedral in Melbourne, Catholic guests, including captain [[Lindsay Hassett]] (Australia’s first Catholic captain) were not permitted entry.<ref name="haigh"/> [[David Johnston (cricketer)|David Johnston]] was the Chief Executive of the [[Tasmanian Cricket Association]] at the time of Johnston's death.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/news/Sport/Invincible-Bill-Johnston-dies-at-85/2007/05/25/1179601642763.html 'Invincible' Bill Johnston dies at 85]</ref><ref name="smh"/> David Johnston played 10 games in the [[Sheffield Shield]] for [[Southern Redbacks|South Australia]].<ref name="az"/>

Outside cricket, Johnston also played baseball. He won the world's junior championship for throwing a distance of 125 yards, and he broke the national baseball long distance record with a 132 yard throw in September 1945.<ref name="wisden"/>

Johnston died peacefully in a [[Sydney]] nursing home on May 25, 2007.
