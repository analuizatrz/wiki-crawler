'''''Ars moriendi''''' ("The Art of Dying") is the name of two related [[Latin]] texts dating from about [[1415]] and [[1450]] which offer advice on the protocols and procedures of a good [[death]] and on how to "die well", according to [[Christianity|Christian]] [[precept]]s of the late [[Middle Ages]]. It was written within the historical context of the effects of the macabre horrors of the [[Black Death]] 60 years earlier and consequent social upheavals of the [[15th century]]. It was very popular, translated into most West [[European languages]], and was the first in a western literary tradition of guides to death and dying.

There was originally a "long version" and then a later "short version" containing eleven [[woodcut]] pictures as instructive images which could be easily explained and memorized.

==Long version==

The original "long version", called ''Tractatus'' (or ''Speculum'') ''artis bene moriendi'', was composed in [[1415]] by an anonymous [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friar, probably at the request of the [[Council of Constance]] (1414&ndash;1418, Germany).<ref name=blake>N.F. Blake (1982). "Ars Moriendi". ''Dictionary of the Middle Ages''. v.1, pp547-8. ISBN 0-684-16760-3</ref>  It was widely read and translated into most West European languages, and was very popular in England where a literary tradition based on it survived until the 17th century ''[[Holy Living and Holy Dying]]'' which was the "artistic climax" of the consolatory death literature tradition that had begun with ''Ars moriendi''<ref>Nancy Beaty (1970). ''The Craft of Dying: A Study of the Literary Traditions of the Ars Moriendi in England''. ISBN 0-300-01336-1</ref>. Other works in the English tradition include ''[[The Waye of Dying Well]]'' and ''[[The Sick Mannes Salve]]''. ''Ars moriendi'' was also among the first books printed with movable type and was widely circulated in nearly 100 editions before 1500, in particular in Germany. The long version survives in about 300 manuscript versions, only one illustrated. 

''Ars moriendi'' consists of six chapters<ref name=blake/>:

# The first chapter explains that dying has a good side, and serves to console the dying man that death is not something to be afraid of.
# The second chapter outlines the five temptations that beset a dying man, and how to avoid them.  These are lack of [[faith]], [[despair]], [[patience|impatience]], [[pride|spiritual pride]], and [[avarice]].
# The third chapter lists the seven questions to ask a dying man, along with consolation available to him through the redemptive powers of [[Christ]]'s love.
# The fourth chapter expresses the need to imitate Christ's life.
# The fifth chapter addresses the friends and family, outlining the general rules of behavior at the deathbed.
# The sixth chapter includes appropriate [[prayer]]s to be said for a dying man.

==Short version==

The "short version", whose appearance shortly precedes the introduction in the 1460s of [[Woodblock printing|block book]]s (books printed from carved blocks of wood, both text and images on the same block), first dates to around 1450, from the [[Netherlands]].<ref name=blake/> It is mostly an adaptation of the second chapter of the "long version", and contains eleven woodcut pictures. The first ten woodcuts are divided into 5 pairs, with each set showing a picture of the [[devil]] presenting one of the 5 temptations, and the second picture showing the proper remedy for that temptation. The last woodcut shows the dying man, presumably having successfully navigated the maze of temptations, being accepted into [[heaven]], and the devils going back to [[hell]] in confusion.

The "short version" was as popular as the "long version", but there was no [[English language|English]] translation. This is maybe due to the fact that English people wrote and understood several european languages at that time. There are six extant manuscripts of the short version, most not illustrated, and over twenty extant [[blockbooks|blockbook]] illustrated editions, using 13 different sets of blocks.<ref>A Hyatt Mayor (1971), ''Prints and People'', Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton, numbers 23-25.ISBN 0-691-00326-2</ref>

== The images ==

As well as the thirteen different sets of [[blockbooks|blockbook]] [[woodcut]]s, there is a set by [[Master ES]] in [[engraving]]. The lengthy controversy over their respective dating and priority is now resolved by the discovery by Fritz Saxl of an earlier illuminated manuscript, of well before 1450, from whose tradition all the images in the printed versions clearly derive. Studies of the [[watermarks]] of the [[blockbooks]] by Allen Stevenson at the [[British Museum]] in the 1960s confirmed that none of them predated the 1460s, so [[Master ES]]'s engravings are the earliest printed versions, dating from around 1450. The images remain largely the same in all media for the rest of the century.<ref>Alan Shestack (1967). ''Master E.S.'', exhibition catalogue, Philadelphia Museum of Art, exhibit numbers 4-15</ref>

There is the exceptional number of about seventy [[incunabulum]] editions, in a variety of languages, from Catalan to Dutch, the earliest from about 1474 from [[Cologne]]<ref>[http://138.253.81.72/~cheshire/cgi-bin/istc/istcsearch.cgi?squery=search++(topicWord+%5C%5B5%3D100%5C%5D+%7B+ars+moriendi+%7D+)+resultsetid+SearchResults&recno=1&sorttype1=attr&sortfield1=istcnum ISTC, British Library]</ref>

==Significance==

The need to prepare for one's death was well known in [[Medieval literature]] through death-bed scenes, but before the [[15th century]] there was no literary tradition on how to prepare to die, on what a good death meant, or on how to die well. The protocols, rituals and consolations of the death bed were usually reserved for the services of an attending priest. ''Ars moriendi'' was an innovative response by the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] to changing conditions brought about by the [[Black Death]] &mdash; the ranks of the clergy had been particularly hard hit, and it would take generations to replace them in both quantity and quality &mdash; the text and pictures provided the services of a "virtual priest" to the lay public, an idea that just 60 years earlier would have been an unthinkable intrusion on the powers of the church. ''Ars moriendi'' provided guidance to dying for those who experienced the macabre horrors of the [[14th century|14th]] and [[15th century|15th]] centuries, in particular the Black Death; and for those who were looking for ways to distinguish themselves by doing the "proper" acts in a culture increasingly status conscious in a depopulated but consequently [[per capita]] more prosperous [[Europe]]. Allegorically the images depicted the contest between angels and demons over the fate of the dying man. In his dying agony his soul emerges from his mouth to be received by one of a band of angels.
