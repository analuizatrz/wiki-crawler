'''Ishmael''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: '''יִשְׁמָעֵאל''', <small>[[Hebrew language#Modern Hebrew|Standard]]</small> {{unicode|Yišmaʿel}} <small>[[Tiberian vocalization|Tiberian]]</small> {{unicode|Yišmāʿêl}}; [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: '''إسماعيل''', Ismā'īl) was [[Abraham]]'s eldest son, born by his wife's [[handmaiden]] [[Hagar (Bible)|Hagar]]. Though born of Hagar, according to the [[Mesopotamian]] law, Ishmael was credited as Sarah's son (Gn. 16:2)<ref name="EoR-Ishmael"> Fredrick E. Greenspahn, Encyclopedia of Religion, ''Ishmael'', p.4551-4552 </ref>  According to the [[Genesis]] account, he died at the age of 137 (Gn. 25:17).<ref name="Catholic1913"/>

[[Judaism]] has generally viewed Ishmael as wicked though repentant.<ref name="EoR-Ishmael"/> Judaism maintains that Isaac (the father of the Jewish people) rather than Ishmael was the true heir of Abraham.<ref name="Britannica"/> The New Testament contains few references to Ishmael. Biblically, Ishmael is used to symbolize the older - now rejected - Judaic tradition; Isaac symbolizes the new tradition of Christianity.<ref name="EoR-Ishmael"/> Islamic tradition, however, has a very positive view of Ishmael, giving him a larger and more significant role. The Qur'an views him as a prophet. According to the interpretation of certain early theologians whose view prevailed later, Ishmael was the actual son that Abraham was called on to sacrifice, as opposed to Isaac.<ref name="EoR-Ishmael"/><ref name="EoI-Ishaq"> [[William Montgomery Watt]], [[Encyclopedia of Islam]], ''Ishaq''</ref>

Both Jewish and Islamic traditions consider Ishmael as the ancestor of [[Arab|Arab people]]. <ref name="EoR-Ishmael"/> 

==Etymology and meaning==
The word ''Yishm'e'l'' existed in various ancient Semitic cultures.<ref name="EoR-Ishmael"/>  For example, it is known that the name was used in early [[Babylonian]] and in Minæan.<ref name="Catholic1913"/> It is translated literally as "God has hearkened", suggesting that "a child so named was regarded as the fulfillment of a divine promise."<ref name="EoR-Ishmael"/>

Chapters 16-25 of the book of Genesis contain the stories of Ishmael.<ref name="Catholic1913"/> [[Historian]]s and [[academic]]s in the fields of [[linguistic]]s and [[source criticism]] believe that the stories of Ishmael belong to the three strata of J, or Yahwist source, the P, or [[Priestly source]], and  the E, or [[Elohist source]] (See [[Documentary hypothesis]]). <ref name="Catholic1913"/>For example, The narration in {{niv|Genesis|16|Genesis 16}} is of J type and the narration in {{niv|Genesis|21:8-21|Genesis 21:8-21}} is of E type. <ref> S.

;The account of the life of Ishmael according to the Hebrew Bible

According to the Bible, [[Sarah]] ([[Abraham]]'s wife) was childless, yet desired a son.  She offers her maidservant [[Hagar (Bible)|Hagar]] to Abraham as a surrogate.  Customs of the time dictated that, although Hagar was the [[Mother|birth mother]], any child conceived would belong to Sarah and Abraham. <ref name="Britannica">"Hagar." [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. </ref> <ref> Gn 16:2</ref>.

Hagar became pregnant and became arrogant, which resulted in harsh treatment by Sarah. Hagar fled and ran into the wilderness, where an angel appeared to her by a spring of water. <ref name="Britannica"/> The angel of the Lord told her to return, adding that God would increase her descendants through a son whose name would be Ishmael. The angel told Hagar that Ishmael would become "a wild donkey of a man" and will be in constant struggle with others.<ref name="Britannica"/>

So Hagar returned to Abraham's house, and had a son whom she named Ishmael.<ref name="Britannica"/> Abraham was 86 years old when Ishmael was born.<ref> [http://www.who2.com/abraham.html Personalities biography of Abraham at Who2, LLC]</ref> According to custom, Ishmael was circumcised at the age of thirteen. <ref name="JewishEnc"> [[Jewish Encyclopedia]], [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=277&letter=I&search=Ishmael ''Ishmael''] </ref> The next year, Abraham's wife Sarah became pregnant with his second son, Isaac.<ref name="Britannica"/>  One day Sarah was angered by seeing Ishmael mocking or playing with Isaac (the Hebrew word  is ambiguous<ref> [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=53&letter=H&search=Hagar Hagar], Jewish Encyclopedia </ref>),<ref name="Catholic1913"> [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/Ismael Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)] </ref> and she asked Abraham to expel him and his mother, saying: "Get rid of that slave woman and her son, for that slave woman's son will never share in the inheritance with my son Isaac."<ref name="Britannica"/> <ref> Genesis 21:8-10 </ref> Ishmael was very dear to Abraham and he initially refused to do as Sarah asked.<ref name="Catholic1913"/> He finally gave in to his wife's request when God told him that He would take care of Ishmael, since he was a descendant of Abraham.<ref name="JewishEnc"/><ref> Genesis 21:11-13 </ref> Abraham provided Hagar and her child with bread and a bottle of water and sent her into the desert.<ref name="JewishEnc"/><ref>Columbia Encyclopedia, ''Ishmael'' </ref> Hagar, with her son, wandered in the wilderness and ran out of water.

Lift the boy up and take him by the hand, for I will make him into a great nation."<ref name="JewishEnc"/><ref> Genesis 21:17-21 </ref>

They lived in the wilderness of Paran, where Hagar's son became an expert in [[archery]]. His mother married him to an [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] woman.<ref name="JewishEnc"/> According to the Bible, Ishmael had 12 sons who became twelve tribal chiefs. The twelve sons of Ishmael, were named [[Nebaioth]], [[Kedar]], [[Adbeel]], [[Mibsam]], [[Mishma]], [[Dumah]], [[Massa (Biblical person)|Massa]], [[Hadad (Bible)|Hadad]], [[Tema]], [[Jetur]], [[Naphish]], and [[Kedemah]] (See {{niv|Genesis|25|Genesis 25}}) <ref name="Catholic1913"/> Ishmael's sons settled everywhere from [[Havilah]] to [[Shur]], i.e. from [[Assyria]] to the border of Egypt.<ref name="JewishEnc"/> Ishmael also had a daughter named Mahalath or Bashemath who married [[Esau]].<ref> [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=386&letter=B&search=Mahalath Jewish Encyclopedia], ''Mahalath'' </ref>.

==Jewish traditions==
{{seealso|Hagar (Bible)#Hagar in Jewish mysticism|Isaac#Jewish_traditions}}
Judaism has generally viewed Ishmael as wicked though repentant.<ref name="EoR-Ishmael"/> According to the [[Haggadah]] Ishmael was as an idolater and a "brother-hater, who becomes ill from Sarah's [[evil eye]]."<ref name="BrillNewPoly"> Yvonne Domhardt,''"Ishmael, Ishmaelites"'', Brill's New Pauly </ref> Ishmael later repents and comes to revere his brother Isaac.<ref name="BrillNewPoly"/>

In some Rabbinic traditions, Ishmael is said to have had two wives named Aisha and Fatima, the names of [[Muhammad]]'s wife and daughter.<ref name="EoR-Ishmael"/> The Medieval Jews were  representing the Muslim world (first Arabs and then Turks) with Ishmael. <ref> Shalom Paul in The Oxford Dictionary of Jewish Religion, p.358 </ref>

[[Israelites|The Israelites]] regarded the supposedly freedom-loving and bellicose descendents of Ishmael as inferior because Abraham had expelled Ishmael and his mother.<ref name="BrillNewPoly"/><ref name="EoR-Ishmael"/>

==New Testament==
{{seealso|Hagar (Bible)#Hagar in the New Testament|Isaac#New Testament}}
According to the Genesis account, at the instigation of Sarah, Ishmael and his mother were expelled in order to make sure that Isaac would be Abraham's heir. In the [[Epistle to the Galatians|book of Galatians]], Paul uses the incident "to symbolize the relationship between Judaism, the older but now rejected tradition, and Christianity." (Gal 4:21-31)<ref name="EoR-Ishmael"/> In [[Galatians]] 4:28-31,<ref>{{niv|Galatians|4:28-31|Galatians 4:28-31}}</ref> [[Hagar]] is associated with the [[Sinai]] covenant, while [[Sarah]] is associated with the covenant of grace (into which her son Isaac enters).<ref name="EoC-Isaac">Encyclopedia of Christianity(Ed. John Bowden), Isaac </ref>

==Islam ==
{{main|Islamic view of Ishmael}}
{{seealso|Hagar (Bible)#Hagar in Islamic traditions}}

Ishmael (Arabic: ''Ismāʿīl'') is a [[Prophets of Islam|prophet]] in [[Islam]]. The Qur'an considers him to be a son of Abraham.<ref> Certain Western scholars have suggested that Muhammad was not aware of this connection in the early period of his preaching. Their argument is that the early verses of the Qur'an Ishmael appears in lists mentioning prophets like [[Jonah]], [[Lot]] and [[Idris]] without any association with Abraham. (e.g. see {{Quran-usc|6|86}},{{Quran-usc|21|85}}, {{Quran-usc|38|48}}). Reuven Firestone in [[Encyclopedia of the Qur'an]] says that there are some evidence to the contrary of claim of those western scholars. </ref> His name appears tweleve times in the Qur'an mostly in a list<ref> The Qur'an generally lists Ishmael in the formula: “Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the tribes” (e.g. see {{Quran-usc|2|136}}, {{Quran-usc|3|84}}), sometimes as "Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac". In verse {{Quran|2|133}} Ishmael is mentioned as “Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac” and in some other lists Ishmael's name is absent from the list :"Abraham, Isaac and Jacob" such as {{Quran-usc|6|84}};{{Quran-usc|12|38}} cf ''Ishmael'', [[Encyclopedia of the Qur'an]]</ref> with other prophets "as part of a litany of remembrances in which the [[Jahiliyyah|pre-Islamic]] prophets are praised for their resolute steadfastness and obedience to God, often in the face of adversity."<ref name="EoQ_Ishmael"> ''Ishmael'', [[Encyclopedia of the Qur'an]] </ref> 

Both Jewish and Islamic traditions consider Ishmael as the ancestor of Arab people. According to the Muslim tradition, Muhammad was a descendant of Ishmael through his son Kedar.<ref name="JewishEnc"/>
[[Image:Kaba.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Picture of the Kaaba taken in 1880]]
Abraham and Ishmael are said to have built the foundations of the [[Ka'aba]] ("They were raising the foundations of [[Ka'aba|the House]]", {{Quran-usc|2|127}}).<ref name="EoQ_Ishmael"/> Islamic traditions hold that Ka'aba was first built by the first man, [[Adam]]. Abraham and Ishmael rebuilt the Kaaba on the old foundations. <ref>Azraqi, ''Akhbar Makkah'', vol. 1, pp. 58-66</ref>

The [[Qur'an]] states that Abraham was commanded to sacrifice his son. The son is not however named in the Qur'an (see {{Quran-usc-range|37|99|113}}) and in early [[Islam]], there was a fierce controversy over the identity of the son. However the belief that it was Ishmael prevailed later and it was fully endorsed by the [[Muslim]] scholars.<ref name="EoI_Ishaq"/> The argument of those early scholars who believed in the Ishmael theory was that "the promise to Sarah of Isaac followed by [[Jacob]] ({{Quran-usc-range|11|71|74}}) excluded the possibility of a [[Binding of Isaac|sacrifice of Isaac]]."<ref name="EoI_Ishaq"/> The other party held that the son of sacrifice was Isaac since "God's perfecting his mercy on Abraham and Isaac (in {{Quran-usc|12|6}}) referred to his making Abraham his friend and saving him from the burning bush and to his rescuing Isaac."<ref name="EoI_Ishaq"/>

According to [[Bruce Metzger]] and Michael Coogan, professors of Religious Studies, the circumcision of Muslims has its roots in the tradition that Ishmael was circumcised.<ref> Bruce M Metzger and Michael D Coogan (1993), pp. 329 (Under 'Ishmael'). </ref>

== Bahá'í Faith ==
The Bahá'í writings state that it was Ishmael, and not Isaac, who was the son of Abraham that was almost sacrificed.<ref>{{cite book |author = Bahá'u'lláh |authorlink = Bahá'u'lláh |year = 1976 |title = Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |id = ISBN 0877431876 |url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/GWB/gwb-32.html#gr1 | pages = pp. 75-76}}</ref> However, the Bahá'í writings also state that the name is unimportant as either could be used since the importance is that both were symbols of sacrifice.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Interpretation in the Bahá'í Faith | first = Juan R.I. | last = Cole | journal = Baha'i Studies Review | volume= 5 | number = 1 | year = 1995 | url = http://bahai-library.org/articles/cole.interpretation.html}}</ref> The [[Bahá'í]] writings also consider Ishmael an ancestor of Muhammad and the Arabs.<ref>{{cite book |author = `Abdu'l-Bahá |authorlink = `Abdu'l-Bahá |origdate = 1904-06 |year = 1981 |title = Some Answered Questions |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |pages = p. 13 |id = ISBN 0877431906 |url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/SAQ/saq-4.html#pg13 }}</ref>
