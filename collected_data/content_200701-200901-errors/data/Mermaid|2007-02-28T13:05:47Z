:''See [[Mermaid (disambiguation)]]''
A '''mermaid''' (from the [[Middle English]] ''mere'' in the obsolete sense 'sea' + ''maid(en)'') is a [[legendary creature|legendary]] aquatic creature with the head and torso of human female and the tail of a fish. The male version of a mermaid is called a [[merman]]; the gender-neutral plural is ''merfolk''. Various cultures throughout the world have similar figures.  Much like [[Sirens]], mermaids in stories would sometimes sing to sailors and enchant them, distracting them from their work and causing them to walk off the deck or cause shipwrecks. Other stories would have them squeeze the life out of drowning men while trying to rescue them. They are also said to take them down to their underwater kingdoms. In [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' it is said that they forget that humans can't breathe underwater, while others say they drown men out of spite.

The [[Siren]]s of [[Greek mythology]] are sometimes portrayed in later [[folklore]] as mermaid-like; in fact, some languages use the same word for both creatures. Other related types of [[mythology|mythical]] or [[legend]]ary creature are [[water fairies]] (e.g. various [[Nymph|water nymphs]]) and [[selkie]]s.

==Legend and myth==
Legends of these half-human, half-fish humanoids have circulated for millennia, even as far back as 5,000 B.C.[http://www.americanmonsters.com/monsters/aquatic/index.php?detail=article&idarticle=24] 
It has been widely suggested or implied that [[manatee]]s or [[dugong]]s could be behind the myth of the mermaid. These large aquatic [[mammal]]s are notable for the way in which they carry their young, cradled in their arms much as a human would carry a baby. It is possible that sailors seeing these unfamiliar beasts for the first time, would assume that they had in fact stumbled across some sort of [[humanoid]] species, and consequently spread their accounts of the sightings through their homelands on their return from voyages. It has even been posited that the traditional image of a mermaid with long flowing hair could be attributed to manatees breaking the ocean surface underneath patches of [[seaweed]], and giving the unfamiliar observer the impression of having long hair.

=== Ancient Near East ===

Tales of mermaids are nearly universal. The first known mermaid [[folklore|stories]] appeared in [[Assyria]], ca. [[1000s BCE|1000 BCE]]. [[Atargatis]], the mother of Assyrian queen [[Semiramis]], was a goddess who loved a mortal shepherd and in the process killed him. Ashamed, she jumped into a lake to take the form of a fish, but the waters would not conceal her divine nature. Thereafter, she took the form of a mermaid &mdash; human above the waist, fish below &mdash; though the earliest representations of Atargatis showed her as being a fish with a human head and legs, similar to the [[Babylonia|Babylonian]] [[Enki|Ea]]. The Greeks recognized Atargatis under the name Derketo, where she was often [[wiktionary:conflate|conflated]] with [[Aphrodite]].

Prior to 546 B.C., the Milesian philosopher [[Anaximander]] proposed that mankind had sprung from an aquatic species of animal. He thought that man with his extended [[infancy]] could not have survived, originally, in the manner he does presently. This idea does not appear to have survived Anaximander's death.

A popular Greek legend has [[Alexander the Great]]'s sister, [[Thessalonice of Macedon|Thessalonike]], turn into a mermaid after her death.<ref> [http://www.mpt.org/programsinterests/mpt/alexander/guide/teachers_guide.pdf Teacher's Guide]</ref> She lived, it was said, in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] and when sailors would encounter her, she would ask them only one question: ''"Is Alexander the king alive?"'' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ''Ζει ο βασιλιάς Αλέξανδρος''), to which the correct answer would be ''"He lives and still rules"'' (Greek: ''Ζει και βασιλεύει''). Any other answer would spur her into a rage, where she transformed into a [[Gorgon]] and meant doom for the ship and every sailor onboard.

[[Lucian|Lucian of Samosata]] in [[Syria]] (2nd century CE) in ''De Dea Syria'' ("Concerning the Syrian Goddess") wrote of the Syrian temples he had visited:
:"Among them - Now that is the traditional story among them concerning the temple. But other men swear that Semiramis of [[Babylonia]], whose deeds are many in Asia, also founded this site, and not for Hera [[Atargatis]] but for her own Mother, whose name was [[Atargatis|Derketo]]"
:"I saw the likeness of Derketo in [[Phoenicia]], a strange marvel. It is woman for half its length, but the other half, from thighs to feet, stretched out in a fish's tail. But the image in [[Jerusalem|the Holy City]] is entirely a woman, and the grounds for their account are not very clear. They consider fishes to be sacred, and they never eat them; and though they eat all other fowls, they do not eat the dove, for she is holy so they believe. And these things are done, they believe, because of Derketo and [[Semiramis]], the first because Derketo has the shape of a fish, and the other because ultimately Semiramis turned into a [[dove]]. Well, I may grant that the temple was a work of Semiramis perhaps; but that it belongs to Derketo I do not believe in any way. For among the [[Egyptians]], some people do not eat fish, and that is not done to honor Derketo." <ref>Lucian of Samosata, ''De Dea Syria'' Part 2, Chapter 14</ref>

The [[Arabian Nights]] include several tales featuring "Sea People". Unlike the depiction in other mythologies, these are anatomically identitcal to land-bound humans, differing only in their ability to breathe and live underwater. They can (and do) interbreed with land humans, the children of such unions inheriting the ability to live underwater.

===British===
[[Image:Themerm.jpg|thumb|right|300|''The [[mermaid]]'' by ,  [[Frederic Leighton]], 1858]]  
Mermaids were noted in British folklore as both ominous, foretelling disaster, and provoking it.  Some were described as monstrous in size, up to 160 feet.<ref>Katharine Briggs, ''An Encyclopedia of Fairies, Hobgoblins, Brownies, Boogies, and Other Supernatural Creatures'', "Mermaids", p 287. ISBN 0-394-73467-X</ref>

Mermaids could also swim up rivers to freshwater lakes.  One day, in a lake near his house, the Laird of Lorntie saw, as he thought, a woman drowning, and went to aid her; a servant of his pulled him back, warning that it was a mermaid, and the mermaid screamed after that she would have killed him if it were not for his servant.<ref>K. M. Briggs, ''The Fairies in English Tradition and Literature'', p 57 University of Chicago Press, London, 1967</ref>

On occasion, mermaids could be more beneficient, giving humans means of cure.<ref>Katharine Briggs, ''An Encyclopedia of Fairies, Hobgoblins, Brownies, Boogies, and Other Supernatural Creatures'', "Mermaids", p 288. ISBN 0-394-73467-X</ref>

Some tales raised the question of whether mermaids had immortal souls to answer it in the negative.<ref>Katharine Briggs, ''An Encyclopedia of Fairies, Hobgoblins, Brownies, Boogies, and Other Supernatural Creatures'', "Mermaids", p 289. ISBN 0-394-73467-X</ref>  The figure of Liban appears as a sanctified mermaid, but she was originally a human being transformed into a mermaid; after three centuries, when Christianity had come to Ireland, she came to be baptized.<ref>Katharine Briggs, ''An Encyclopedia of Fairies, Hobgoblins, Brownies, Boogies, and Other Supernatural Creatures'', "Liban", p 266-7. ISBN 0-394-73467-X</ref>

Mermen were also noted, as wilder and uglier than mermaids, but they were described as having little interest in humans.<ref>Katharine Briggs, ''An Encyclopedia of Fairies, Hobgoblins, Brownies, Boogies, and Other Supernatural Creatures'', "Mermen", p 290. ISBN 0-394-73467-X</ref>

=== Other ===
Among the [[Neo-Taíno nations]] of the Caribbean the mermaid is called [[Aycayía]].<ref>http://www.conexioncubana.net/tradiciones/diccionario/a.htm</ref> Her attributes relate to the goddess [[Jagua]], and the hibiscus flower of the majagua tree [[Hibiscus tiliaceous]].<ref>http://www.hear.org/starr/hiplants/images/thumbnails/html/hibiscus_tiliaceus.htm</ref> Examples from other cultures are the [[Mami Wata]] of [[West Africa|West]] and [[Central Africa]], the [[Jengu]] of [[Cameroon]], the [[Merrow]] of [[Ireland]] and [[Scotland]], the Russalki of [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]], and the Greek [[Oceanid]]s, [[Nereid]]s, and [[Naiad]]s. One freshwater mermaid-like creature from European folklore is [[Melusine]], who is sometimes depicted with two fish tails, and other times with the lower body of a [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]].  It is said in [[Japan]] that eating the flesh of a mermaid can grant unaging [[immortality]]. In some [[European]] legends mermaids are said to grant wishes.

Also, some people claim they have seen dead or living mermaids in places like [[Scotland]], [[Malaysia]] and [[British Columbia]]. Two most recent Canadian sightings took place in the [[Straight of Georgia]]. [http://www.tourismvictoria.com/Content/EN/747.asp], 
[http://www.folklore.bc.ca/Folkexamples.htm]

It is rumored amongst some of the "Cape Coloured" communities of South Africa that mermaids are found in the Little Karoo. Some older Cape Coloureds claim to have seen mermaids in fresh water pools during their childhood. Whilst the Little Karoo is a very dry area, pre-hisotically it formed a part of an ocean which is substantiated by evidence such as fossiled shells in the area. The story of mermaids has been orally passed down through an unknown number of generations. It is thought that some local bushman rock art depicted at approximately 11 rock art sites around the Little Karoo illustrates the existence of mermaids. Other explanations are that the rock paintings illustrate a bird called a swallow with the figure of a human head. This illustration represents the outer body experience of spiritual men during spiritual ceremonies undertaken to conjure up rain. Since the Cape Coloured community stems from a mixture of white settlers and local indigenous tribes such as the Khoi and San, it is thought that the story of mermaids was brought with the white settlers and misinterpreted is this rock art.

===Literature===


Mermaids are one of the most famous creatures of [[popular culture]], and are depicted regularly in literature and film. This is likely due to the influence of [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s [[fairytale]] ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' ([[1836]]), which has been translated into many languages.  Andersen's portrayal, immortalized with a famous bronze sculpture in [[Copenhagen]] harbour, has arguably become the standard and has influenced most modern Western depictions of mermaids since it was published.  The story has been retold in other films and television programs, and regularly features in collections of fairytales.  It has been adapted into various media, the most famous of which is the [[1989]] [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] [[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|movie of the same name]].

[[L. Frank Baum]] (creator of [[Land of Oz|Oz]]) wrote a novel about merfolk, ''[[The Sea Fairies]]''.

Mermaids appear in the [[Peter Pan]] novel and in adaptations of it (such as the film ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'') and the [[Harry Potter]] series, specifically in ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]''.

Many mermaids appear in works of fantasy fiction, including [[Poul Anderson]]'s ''The Merman's Children''.<ref>John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Mermaids" p 639 ISBN 0-312-19869-8</ref>

In the [[comic book]] series, ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'', in issue #4 (July 1959), the 4-page story "I Love a Mermaid!" presented a sailor falling in love with a mermaid named Alethea. For  years, the sailor had always been drawn to the sea, but never knew why he was so interested, but for some unknown reason he would always take out a small boat and venture out to sea. One day, he met Alethea and knew he was in love with her. When the sun  went down, Alethea returned to the sea, much to the sailor's disapointment. The next day in the morning, both the sailer and Alethea met again at the same spot in the ocean just from the day before. The sailor admitted his feelings to the mermaid, with the mermaid saying that she too was in love with him. The sailor wanted him and Alethea to be together forever, but the mermaid, concerned for his well being and fear of him drowning if he chose to follow her into the sea, decided to leave him by not allowing their for love for each other to destroy his life. She swam back deep into the ocean. The sailor jumped off his boat and swam after her. The sailor then realised why he had always been drawn to the ocean: he was in fact a merman, and had found his own land, an underwater city of merpeople. The sailor had found his way home, with Alethea at his side. 

The [[comic book]] [[superhero]] ''[[Superman]]'' had a romantic love interest with a mermaid named [[Lori Lemaris]]. The name Lori Lemaris was probably drawn from [[Lorelei]] rock in the [[Rhine]] added to ''maris'', from the [[Latin]] ''mare'', meaning ocean.

''[[Aquamarine (film)|Aquamarine]]'', a novel by [[Alice Hoffman]], is about two 13 year old girls who discover a sassy teenage mermaid.  The novel was popular among teen and preteen girls.  The novel was made in to a film released in [[2006]] by Twentieth Century Fox and starred [[Sara Paxton]], [[Emma Roberts]] and [[JoJo]].

=== Music ===
'''Mermaid Music'''
Mermaids have long been associated with [[music]], and much like that of [[Orpheus]], the power of their singing voices had the ability to enthrall.
Along with their legendary vanity, the hair-combing and mirrors, the association of mermaids with music is coupled with another association of a vocal nature: they are said to be able to confer verbal eloquence, much like the Muses of the ancient [[Greek myths]].
Mermaids and other mers are associated with many attributes and assigned different themes around the world, of course, but of the half-human, half-other type of animal creations of lore, the mermaid seems to have survived at least in the West, more ably than other chimerical mythic beings.
The fact that the mers have fish tails is significant, and points to our ancient origins as denizens of the deep, and the nature of the mystical and mysterious fathoms have given rise to symbolism of these sea people in our concept of the subconscious realms.
Standing in usually for the mysteries of female sexuality and for the libertine behavior most myths ascribed to the wild women of the seas, so, too, was the music made by mermaids seen as somewhat depraved as well as dangerous.
Forever our imaginations will be stirred by the love and death themes implied by the music of the mers in all their pitiless, heart-breaking vanity.

[[Mermaid Music]] is a CD by the singer-songwriter, [[Ocean (Singer)]]. [[The Little Mermaid]]music by [[Disney]]

===Hoaxes===
In the [[19th century]], [[P. T. Barnum]] displayed in his museum a [[taxidermy|taxidermal]] hoax called the ''[[Fiji mermaid|Feejee [''sic''] Mermaid]].'' Others have perpetrated similar hoaxes, which are usually [[papier-mâché]] fabrications or parts of deceased creatures, usually monkeys and fish, stitched together for the appearance of a grotesque mermaid. In the wake of the [[2004 tsunami]], pictures of Fiji "mermaids" were passed around on the internet as something that had washed up amid the devastation, though they were no more real than Barnum's exhibit.<ref>http://www.snopes.com/photos/tsunami/mermaid.asp</ref>

==Artwork==
Perhaps one of the most famous mermaid paintings in the world was created by [[John William Waterhouse]], painted from 1895 to 1905, entitled ''A Mermaid'', (see the top of this article). An example of late British Academy style artwork, the piece debuted to considerable acclaim (and secured Waterhouse's place as a member of the [[Royal Academy]]), but disappeared into a private collection and didn't resurface until the 1970s. It is currently in the collection of [[Lord Lloyd-Webber|Andrew Lloyd Weber]].

===Heraldry===
[[Image:POL Warszawa COA 1.svg|thumb|right|100px|Coat of arms of Warsaw]]
In [[heraldry]], the charge of a mermaid is commonly represented with a comb and a mirror, and blazoned as a 'mermaid in her vanity.' Merfolk were used to symbolize eloquence in speech.

A shield and sword-wielding mermaid (''Syrenka'') is on the official [[Coat of arms of Warsaw]], the capital of [[Poland]].

The personal coat of arms of [[Michaëlle Jean]], Canada's [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]], features two [[Simbi]], mermaid-like spirits from [[Haiti]]an [[vodun]], as [[supporters]].

===Advertising===
[[Image:Mermaid-ChickenOfTheSea-sm.png|70px|left]]
A [[cartoon]] mermaid (seen at left) is the [[mascot]] for the [[Chicken of the Sea]] brand of [[tuna]].

The [[Starbucks|Starbucks Coffee]] [[logo]] is a illustrated picture of a siren.

==Sirenomelia==
[[Sirenomelia]], also called "mermaid syndrome", is a rare [[congenital]] [[disease|disorder]] in which a child is born with his or her legs fused together and the [[Sex organ|genitalia]] reduced. This condition is about as rare as [[conjoined twins]] and is usually fatal within a day or two of birth because of [[kidney]] and [[Urinary bladder|bladder]] complications, though there are three known survivors of this disorder alive today.

==Symbolism==
According to [[Dorothy Dinnerstein]]’s book, ''The Mermaid and the Minotaur'', human-animal hybrids such as the minotaur and the mermaid convey the emergent understanding of the ancients that human beings were both one with and different from animals and that, as such, humans' "nature is internally inconsistent, that our continuities with, and our differences from, the earth's other animals are mysterious and profound; and in these continuities, and these differences, lie both a sense of strangeness on earth and the possible key to a way of feeling at home here".<ref name=Dinnerstein>
