'''''Letters Written During a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark''''' (1796) is a personalized [[travel literature|travel narrative]] and the last published work by [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]. It consists not only of her reflections on Scandinavia and its peoples but also on her relationship with her lover [[Gilbert Imlay]] (although he is not referred to by name). 

Wollstonecraft was strongly influenced by the themes of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau's]] ''[[Reveries of a Solitary Walker]]'' (1782): "the search for the source of human happiness, the stoic rejection of material goods, the ecstatic embrace of nature, and the essential role of sentiment in understanding".<ref>Favret, 104.</ref> While Rousseau ultimately rejects society, Wollstonecraft celebrates domestic scenes and industrial progress in her text.<ref>Favret, 105–6.</ref> Wollstonecraft also explores the connections between the [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] and [[sensibility]]. Many of the letters describe the breathtaking scenery of Scandinavia and Wollstonecraft's desire to create an emotional connection to that natural world. In so doing, she gives greater value to the imagination than she had in previous works. She contrasts this imaginative connection to the world with a commercial and mercenary one, an attitude that she associates with Imlay and which she criticizes throughout the text.<ref>Favret, 119ff.</ref>
