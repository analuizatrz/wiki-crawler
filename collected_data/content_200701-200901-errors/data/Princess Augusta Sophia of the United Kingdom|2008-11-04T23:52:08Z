'''The Princess Augusta Sophia''' (8 November 1768 – 22 September 1840) was a member of the British Royal Family, second daughter of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] and [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Charlotte]]. She was a Princess of the [[United Kingdom]] and a Princess of [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]].

==Early life==
Princess Augusta Sophia was born at [[Buckingham Palace|Buckingham House]], [[St James's Park]], [[London]], the sixth child and second daughter of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] (1738-1820) and his wife [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]]. Her mother was very keen to shelter her daughters, so Augusta was forced to be a companion of her mother, who did not die until a month before the princess's fiftieth birthday. For that reason, she never married or had any children.

==Later life==
According to a flyer held by the V&A Archives, Princess Augusta was a patron of L. Bertolotto's [[flea circus]].

She died on 22 September 1840 at [[Clarence House]], St. James, London, and  was buried at [[St George's Chapel, Windsor]] on 2 October, after lying in state at [[Frogmore]].<ref>{{LondonGazette |issue=19902 |date=1840|10|7 |startpage=2 |endpage=3 |accessdate=2008-07-31}}</ref>
