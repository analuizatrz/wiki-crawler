'''Riverwind''' (also known as ''Riverwind of the Que Shu tribe'' or ''Riverwind of the Que Shu'') is a [[fictional character]] from the ''[[Dragonlance]]'' series of [[Tabletop role-playing game|role playing games]] and [[List of Dragonlance novels|novels]], created by [[Margaret Weis]] and [[Tracy Hickman]], published by [[TSR, Inc.]] and later by [[Wizards of the Coast]].

Riverwind made his first public appearance in the first novel of the original [[List of Dragonlance novels#Chronicles Trilogy|Chronicles Trilogy]], ''[[Dragons of Autumn Twilight]]'', in 1984. However, the character's proper creation was during a [[tabletop role-playing game]] session where Tracy and Laura Hickman, Margaret Weis and Terry Phillips, between others, developed the basic storyline of ''Dragonlance''.<ref name="creation">

Throughout the series, Riverwind became a well known character and, in 14 years, authors made him the protagonist in two novels, ''Riverwind the Plainsman'' (1990) and ''Spirit of the Wind'' (1998).

== Introduction ==
Patrick Lucien Price, author of the "Bertrem's essay on numerology" short story, published in ''Leaves from the Inn of the Last Home'' (1987), describes Riverwind as a character that ''demands change, seeks variety and new opportunities to develop himself'', also a ''natural leader of men'' and ''generous, impressionable, a humanitarian''.<ref name="riverwindself">

Few facts are given about the early life of the character itself, a shepherd living just outside the village of [[List of Dragonlance locations#Que Shu|Que Shu]], a [[Barbarian (Dungeons & Dragons)|barbarian]] settlement in [[Ansalon]], in the fictional world of [[Krynn]]. Laura Hickman and [[Kate Novak]] detail, in the [[short story]] "Heart of Goldmoon" published in the ''Love and War'' (1987) recompilation, Riverwind's faith in the [[List of Dragonlance deities|ancient gods]] and especially in [[Mishakal]], goddess of healing, although the common belief in the tribe was that the high priestess's ancestors become gods.<ref name="faith">

Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman give a reason in the short story "True Knight", published in ''The Cataclysm'' (1992) recompilation, as Riverwind's family is not a native from the Que Shu tribe, but instead his ancestors, Michael, a [[Cleric (Dungeons & Dragons)|cleric]] of Mishakal, and Nikol, daughter of a [[Knights of Solamnia|knight]], travelled to the plains shortly after the [[Cataclysm (Dragonlance)|Cataclysm]], the event in which the gods threw a fiery mountain to punish Krynn arrogance, and kept practicing their religion.<ref name="ancestors">

In "Heart of Goldmoon", Hickman and Novak also inform the reader about the journey to the ''Hall of the Sleeping Spirits'', in which Riverwind acts as a bodyguard to [[Goldmoon]], protecting her life when Hollow-sky, the other bodyguard traveling with them, tries to force her to marry her. With Riverwind and Goldmoon declaring their mutual love, the story ends with Riverwind affirming his intention to request a ''Courting quest'', which would give him the right to marry Goldmoon.

[[Paul B. Thompson]] and Tonya C. Cook give details of such quest in the novel ''Riverwind the Plainsman'' (1990), in which the character, needing to find proof that the [[List of Dragonlance deities|ancient gods]] existed, travels to [[List of Dragonlance locations#Xak Tsaroth|Xak Tsaroth]] and retrieves the [[List of Dragonlance artifacts#Blue Crystal Staff|Blue Crystal Staff]], a holy relic blessed by Mishakal herself, guarded by [[Khisanth]], a [[Dragon (Dungeons & Dragons)|black dragon]].<ref name="questend">

Although the novel ends with the delivery of the staff, in ''[[Dragons of Autumn Twilight]]'' (1984) the authors explain, through Goldmoon, that the tribe tried to [[Stoning|stone]] him when he could not explain how the staff could prove the existence of the old gods.<ref name="staffstory">

==Development through the series==
===Chronicles trilogy===
As in the "Heart of Goldmoon" short story, Riverwind is given the role of Goldmoon's protector in ''[[Dragons of Autumn Twilight]]'' (1984). [[Margaret Weis]] and [[Tracy Hickman]] kept his involvement at a minimum, only describing him as a character with a serious demeanor. The ''War of the Lance'' sourcebook (2004) indicates that he is a man of few words, proud and wary of strangers, who ''does not make friends easily and people have to go a long way to earn his regard.''<ref name="sourcebook">

Understandably, it is in battle sequences where the authors give him more protagonism, effectively drawing on his past as a trained warrior. It is in one of those sequences, against the black dragon Khisanth in Xak Tsaroth, where Riverwind is mortally wounded by the dragons' acid breath. However, Goldmoon, after meeting the soul of her mother and the goddess Mishakal, goddess of healing, is able to restore him to his burnt body.

It is at the end of the first book, when Riverwind marries Goldmoon just outside [[List of Dragonlance locations#Pax Tharkas|Pax Tharkas]] after defeating [[List of Dragonlance characters#Verminaard of Nidus|Lord Verminaard]], that Riverwind receives more attention from the authors.<ref name="marriage">

Weis and Hickman continue diminishing the protagonism of Riverwind in ''[[Dragons of Winter Night]]'' (1985). In the second half of ''[[Dragons of Spring Dawning]]'' (1985), the authors reveal that Goldmoon is pregnant, and the couple decides to stay in [[List of Dragonlance locations#Kalaman|Kalaman]], ending their participation in the [[List of Dragonlance novels#Chronicles Trilogy|Chronicles Trilogy]].

===Legends trilogy===
As the [[List of Dragonlance novels#Legends Trilogy|Legends]] trilogy, written by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman in 1986, focuses on the twins [[Caramon Majere|Caramon]] and [[Raistlin Majere]], Riverwind's appearance is small. In ''Time of the Twins'' (1986) Riverwind visits Caramon and [[Tika Waylan|Tika Majere]] at the [[List of Dragonlance locations#Inn of the Last Home|Inn of the Last Home]] to refuse to escort [[List of Dragonlance characters#Crysania of Tarinius|Lady Crysania]] to the [[Towers of High Sorcery#Tower of High Sorcery of Wayreth|Tower of High Sorcery of Wayreth]]<ref name="refuse">

===Chaos War series===
There are no books about the attacks of [[Chaos (Dragonlance)|Chaos's]] armies to the [[List of Dragonlance locations#Abanasinia|Abanasinian]] tribes. [[Chris Pierson]]'s novel, ''Spirit of the Wind'' (1998), informs that the ''Knights of Takhisis'', knights under the service of [[Takhisis]], goddess of evil, invaded the area bringing brutes, barbarians from northern isles, forcing some tribes to join the Que Shu village to repel the attack, while others separated and left for the mountains. He also hints that at least ''shadow wights'', creatures that possess souls, vanishing them from the world of [[Krynn]], including others' memories of them, attacked the tribe, as Moonsong and Brightdawn explain that their brother, Wanderer, has a three years old son, but nobody, not even Wanderer himself, remembers his mother.<ref name="cloudhawk">

===Age of Mortals series===
In ''Spirit of the Wind'' (1998), Chris Pierson covers the last weeks of Riverwind's life. Afflicted by a terminal illness that had been the cause of his father's death, and without [[Mishakal]], who left [[Krynn]] after the [[Chaos War]], to give clerical powers to Goldmoon to heal him, he travels to the [[List of Dragonlance locations#Inn of the Last Home|Inn of the Last Home]] to inform Caramon and Tika about it.<ref name="dying">

The novel continues explaining that a couple of kender arrive requesting Caramon's help to stop [[Malystryx]], the red dragon overlord, from destroying their home town, [[List of Dragonlance locations#Kendermore|Kendermore]]. Riverwind decides to help them, and is involved in the defense of the city. With the imminent invasion of the dragon and the [[Ogre (Dungeons & Dragons)|ogre]] armies supporting her, Riverwind and Brightdawn travel to ''Blood Watch'', where ''Malystryx's Peak'' was situated and her only egg was laid. Brightdawn dies on her way to the lair while fighting the nest's guardian, Yovanna,<ref name="brightdawndeath">
