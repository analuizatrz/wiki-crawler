The '''carry''' of an [[asset]] is the [[Returns (economics)|return]] obtained from holding it (if positive), or the [[cost]] of holding it (if negative).

For instance, [[commodities]] are usually negative carry assets, as they incur storage costs, but in some circumstances, commodities can be positive carry assets as the market is willing to pay a premium for availability.

This can also refer to a trade with more than one leg, where you earn the [[spread]] between borrowing a low carry asset and lending a high carry one.

Carry trades are not [[arbitrage]]s: pure arbitrages make money no matter what; carry trades make money ''only if nothing changes'' -- but things may changes .

For instance, the traditional income stream from commercial [[bank]]s is to borrow cheap (at the low [[overnight rate]], i.e., the rate at which they pay depositors) and lend expensive (at the long-term rate).

This works in an upward-sloping [[yield curve]], but it loses money if the curve becomes inverted. The floating of short-term rates, for example, when [[Paul Volcker]] was the chairman of the [[Federal Reserve]] resulted in exactly this problem and was the root of the [[Savings and Loan crisis]].

According to a popular anecdote, traditional commercial banking can be characterized as a "3-6-3" business: borrow at 3%, lend at 6% (thus earning the 3% spread), be on the golf course by 3 pm. <ref>[http://www.richmondfed.org/publications/economic_research/economic_quarterly/pdfs/winter2006/walter.pdf The 3-6-3 rule : an urban myth? by John R. Walter, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly]</ref>

==Currency==
{{See also|Foreign exchange market}}

The term '''carry trade''' without further modification refers to currency carry trade: investors borrow low-yielding and lend high-yielding [[currency|currencies]]. It tends to correlate with global financial and [[exchange rate]] stability, and retracts in use during global [[liquidity]] shortages.<ref>[http://www.cfr.org/publication/12842/effect_of_the_rising_yen.html?breadcrumb=%2F CFR Effect of the Rising Yen March 14, 2007 retrieved 3-15-2007]</ref>

The risk in carry trading is that foreign exchange rates may change to the effect that the investor would have to pay back more expensive currency with less valuable currency.<ref>[http://www.moneyweek.com/file/20635/why-is-the-carry-trade-so-dangerous.html Why is the carry trade so dangerous?] ''[[MoneyWeek]]'', 10-27-2006</ref> In theory, according to [[Interest rate parity#Uncovered interest rate parity|uncovered interest rate parity]], carry trades should not yield a predictable [[profit]] because the difference in interest rates between two countries should equal the rate at which investors expect the low-interest-rate currency to rise against the high-interest-rate one. However, carry trades weaken the target currency, because investors sell the borrowed sum and convert it to other currencies.

By early year [[2007]], it was estimated that some US$1 [[1000000000000 (number)|trillion]] may be staked on the [[Japanese yen|yen]] carry trade.<ref>[http://economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8633485 What keeps bankers awake at night?], ''The Economist'', Feb 1st 2007</ref> Since the late-1980's, the [[Bank of Japan]] has set Japanese interest rates at very low levels making it profitable to borrow Japanese yen to fund activities in other currencies.  Many of these activities included matters like [[subprime lending]] in the USA, yet also include funding of [[emerging market]]s, especially [[BRIC]] countries and resource rich countries.
