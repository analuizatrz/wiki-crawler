'''Burger King''' (often abbreviated to '''BK''') is a large international [[chain store|chain]] of [[fast food]] restaurants,  predominantly selling [[hamburger]]s, [[french fries]], [[soft drink]]s, [[dessert]]s, and various [[sandwiches]]. It is headquartered in [[Unincorporated area|unincorporated]] [[Miami-Dade County, Florida]], just outside the city of [[Miami, FL|Miami]]. '''Hungry Jack's''' is a [[franchising|franchisee]] of Burger King that owns, operates and franchises over 300 restaurants in [[Australia]].

===History===
[[Image:Burgerkingrestaurant.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A Burger King restaurant in [[Redwood City, California]]]]

Burger King's first restaurant, originally called '''Insta Burger King''', was opened on [[December 4]], [[1954]] in a suburb of [[Miami, Florida]], [[United States|USA]] by [[James McLamore]] and [[David Edgerton]], who were both alumni of the [[Cornell University School of Hotel Administration]]. McLamore had visited the hamburger stand belonging to [[Dick and Mac McDonald]] in [[San Bernardino, California]]; being able to sense potential in their innovative [[assembly line]]-based production system, he decided to create a version of his own.

In 1989, the Burger King brand acquired many locations of its major [[UK]] rival [[Wimpy Bar|Wimpy]] when its parent company bought the brand from its previous owner [[United Biscuits]] and re-branded them as "Burger King", giving it an even greater presence in that country. While other "Wimpy" locations are still trading today (now independent from BK) they no longer have the presence they once did (the market is now dominated by Burger King and the larger McDonald's).

In 1997, Grand Metropolitan merged with [[Guinness]] to form a company called [[Diageo]].

On Friday, [[December 13]], [[2002]], Burger King was purchased from Diageo for $1.5 (US) billion by a [[private equity]] group headed by [[Stanley Foster]] and the investment firm [[Texas Pacific Group]] (TPG).<ref>[http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/1113/p01s01-usec.html "Are private buyouts good for the economy?"], By Mark Trumbull ; [[13 November]] [[2006]], ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]''</ref> The company planned to go public within the next two years, though this was delayed until 2006. The new owners, through several new CEOs, revitalized the company; they realized about $367 million of the [[dividend]]s.

On [[February 1]], [[2006]], CEO [[Greg Brenneman]] announced TPG's plans to turn Burger King into a publicly traded company by issuing an [[Initial public offering|Initial Public Offering]]. On February 16, the company announced it had filed its registration for the IPO with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]]. On [[May 18]], [[2006]], Burger King began trading on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] under the ticker symbol BKC.

===Trademark disputes===
As it expanded in the United States, Burger King found that smaller operations had previously been using the name. One such restaurant in [[Mattoon, Illinois]] negotiated a settlement that forbids the chain from opening locations within 20 miles (32 km). See [[Burger King (Mattoon, Illinois)]].

In a trademark settlement with San Antonio local chain Whopper Burger, Burger King was not allowed to open locations within two counties of the city. The chain was ultimately bought out in the mid 1980s, opening the way for San Antonio Burger King locations.

A trademark conflict also arose in Australia; see [[Burger King#HungryJacks|Hungry Jack's]], below.

Burger King Holdings is the parent company of Burger King, in the [[US]] it operates under the Burger King Brands title while internationally it operates under the Burger King Corporation banner. It is a publicly traded company with investment firms of Texas Pacific Group, Bain Capital, and Goldman Sachs each owning about 25% of the company.<ref name="2006report">[http://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/irol/87/87140/BKCAR2006.pdf BKC 2006 Annual Report]</ref>

Historically, Burger King has been the second largest burger chain in North America, behind [[McDonald's]]. However, Burger King's revenues and market share have been declining. In the early 2000s, Burger King fell to a near tie for second place with [[Wendy's]]. Burger King has been closing under-performing stores and changing its marketing strategy in an attempt to turn its fortunes around. In fiscal year 2002, the firm had [[United States dollar|US $]]11.3 billion in total sales.<ref name="2006report"/>

As of 2006, there are more than 11,220 Burger King outlets in 61 countries. 66% of the restaurants are in the United States. The company has more than 340,000 employees who serve approximately 11.4 million customers daily.<ref name="2006report"/>

Almost 90% of Burger King restaurants are privately owned and operated, or [[franchising|franchised]]. While Burger King Corporation sets standards for exterior store appearance, food quality and menu, individual owners have control over hours of operations, interior decor, pricing and staff uniforms and wages. For example, [[Magic Johnson]]'s company [[Magic Johnson Enterprises]] purchased 30 Burger King stores on [[June 7]], [[2004]]. The stores were redecorated with a sports memorabilia theme. These locations officially reopened on [[December 3]], [[2004]].<ref name="2006report"/>

Burger King has a longstanding presence at [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] and [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] installations worldwide, dating back to the 1980s under a contract with [[Army and Air Force Exchange Service]]. Today, while other chains such as [[Taco Bell]], [[Popeye's]] and [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] have a presence on military bases, virtually every major Army and Air Force installation hosts a BK restaurant. 
Many Burger King outlets, even inside cities, require customers to operate a motor vehicle to purchase food during late evening hours.<ref name="2006report"/>

Burger King is one of the few companies that does not accept communication via email.

==Hungry Jack's profile==
When Burger King decided to expand its operations into [[Australia]], it found that its business name was already [[trademark]]ed by a man running a small takeaway food shop. In consequence, the Australian franchisee, [[Jack Cowin]], was provided by Burger King with a list of possible alternative names that Australian Burger King restaurants could be branded as. These names were derived from pre-existing trademarks already registered by Burger King and [[Pillsbury]] (which was, at that time, the parent company of Burger King). Cowin selected the branding '''Hungry Jack's''', echoing his name and sentiment. '[[Hungry Jack]]' - without the 'apostrophe S' - was actually a Pillsbury brand, being used in the US to market [[pancake]] (flapjack) mixture. Accordingly, the first Australian franchise of the Burger King Corporation, established in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] in 1971, was branded as Hungry Jack's. 

In 1986, Hungry Jack's purchased 11 failing Australian [[Wendy's|Wendy's Hamburgers]] locations and rebranded them under the Hungry Jack's name.

=== 1996 to 2001 ===

When the existing Australian registered trademark for Burger King lapsed in 1996, the American parent company wanted [[Jack Cowin|Cowin]] to change the Hungry Jack's outlets over to the Burger King name. Cowin resisted the change, but despite this Burger King proceeded between 1996 and 2003 to open more than seventy outlets in [[Australia]] under the Burger King name. These built on their existing stores in international airports &ndash; the international territory apparently outside the Cowin licensing deal. In some cases the new Burger King outlets were located very close to existing Hungry Jack's outlets.

==== Legal proceedings ====

As a result of Burger King's actions, Hungry Jacks Pty. Ltd. began legal proceedings in [[Australia]] against the Burger King Corporation citing violation of the master franchising agreement.

In 2001, the case was finally resolved in favour of Hungry Jack's in a case that eventually included the Australian operating arm of [[Royal Dutch Shell]], and as a result Burger King Corporation was ordered to pay $AUD 75 million to Hungry Jack's for breach of its franchise agreement.<ref>{{Cite Case AU|NSWCA|187|2001}}</ref> One final attempt was made by Burger King to appeal the decision to the [[High Court of Australia]]<ref>{{Cite Case AU|hcatranscripts|S157|1|2001}}</ref>; however, this appeal was dismissed.

=== 2002 to the present day ===

In 2002, Burger King Australia exited the country and sold a 51% share of its Australian restaurants to TPF, the company that operates Burger King in New Zealand. In an attempt to improve rapidly falling sales, TPF re-branded its Burger King restaurants as Hungry Jack's in late 2003 believing that the Hungry Jack's name with its 30 year history was the stronger brand. A market research survey conducted six months after the re-branding showed that Burger King had been the preferred brand, and that the words most often chosen by respondents in the survey to describe Hungry Jack's were "slow" and "dated"{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. In mid 2005, TPF decided to exit the Australian market and sold its 51% share of the former Burger King sites to Hungry Jack's Pty Ltd, the company operated by Jack Cowin.<ref>[http://southflorida.bizjournals.com/southflorida/stories/2003/05/26/daily36.html In Australia, Burger King to become 'Hungry Jack's'] South Florida Business Journal, [[30 May]] [[2003]]</ref>

=== Operational nuances ===

[[Image:Hungry Jack's slogan.png|frame|right|The [[slogan]] "The burgers are better at Hungry Jack's" is well known in [[Australia]].]]While Burger King's logo has since changed to the "blue crescent" design, the Hungry Jack's logo is still ([[as of 2007]]) based on the previous Burger King logo, employing the simpler bun-and-filling motif.

Hungry Jack's sells the usual range of burgers but also offers an Australian speciality: the Aussie Burger. This burger is based on the traditional Australian [[fish and chips]] shop favorite, including fried egg, bacon, onion, and [[beetroot]], with the traditional meat, lettuce, and tomato. Hungry Jack's locations are required to follow any menu changes made by Burger King.

Hungry Jack's introduced a breakfast menu in late 2005 in three states ([[Queensland]], [[New South Wales]], and [[Northern Territory]]). It was subsequently introduced into the other states on [[October 31]] [[2006]].

Hungry Jack's retains strong links with Perth, with the city's first team in the [[Australian Football League]], the [[West Coast Eagles]], having been sponsored by Hungry Jack's since their entry into the league in 1987.

Hungry Jack's has seen success with its Kids Club mascots, allowing children to have themed birthday parties at its restaurants, and also with its Kids Club Meals (similar to [[McDonald's]] [[Happy Meal]]) often using well known collectible toys; see [[Burger King Kingdom]].

Hungry Jack's in Australia has trademarked the new slogan 'Oh Yeah' which has featured in late 2005/early 2006 commercials. Other changes at Hungry Jack's include new fresh salads and deli-style baguettes.

Many Hungry Jack's stores feature a 1950s/1960s styled theme. Background music from this era is may be played (sometimes through a 50s style Jukebox), and contemporary pictures and memorabilia from that era are often hung around the stores. In the larger sit-down style restaurants the seats and tables are laid out in a 1950s [[diner]] style.

==Products==
{{main|Burger King products}}

'''Burger King''' predominantly sells [[hamburgers]], various types of [[chicken]] [[sandwiches]], [[french fries]], [[soft drinks]], and [[desserts]]. In the morning hours, BK sells [[breakfast sandwich]]es and other breakfast items such as 
[[French toast]] sticks. In many markets, BK offers [[salads]] and [[vegetarian]] items, [[Wrap (food)|wraps]] and other localized fare.

The famous Burger King "bun halves" logo made its debut in 1969 and endured well into the 1990s. As its name implies, it was meant to resemble a [[hamburger]]: the logo had two orange semi-circular "buns" surrounding the name, which was the "meat" of the logo. In 1994 BK updated the logo with a graphical tightening, replacing the aging "bulging" font with a smoother font with rounded edges. In addition, all secondary signing, such as roof and directional signs, was also updated with new rounded font.

In 1999, BK again revised its logo. The new Burger King logo is a stylized version of the original "bun halves" logo. BK changed the color of the restaurant's name from orange to red lettering, while leaving them sandwiched between two yellow bun halves. The new logo also tilts the bun halves and the [[font]] on an [[Coordinate axis|axis]], has a smaller "bun" motif and wraps the burger with a blue crescent whipping around the buns giving it a more [[circular]] appearance. Most restaurants did not acquire newer signs with the new logo, menus, and drive-thru ordering speakers until 2001. Again all secondary signage was updated with the new logo and type face, and all sign posts were repainted to match the blue coloring of the new crescent from their original black.<ref>[http://bizjournals.bison.com/press/pr4-14bk.html Burger King Shares Extensive Transformation Plans] press release on BizJornals on Bison.com</ref>

The Hungry Jack's logo is based on the original Burger King "bun halves" design, and has been used since Hungry Jack's founding in 1971. HJ currently uses an updated version of the "bun halves" logo, featuring the smoother font used in revised Burger King logo from 1994.
