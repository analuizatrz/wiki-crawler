'''Constantín mac Áeda''' ([[anglicised]] '''Constantine II''') (before 879 &ndash; [[952]]) was king in [[Scotland]] from [[900]] to [[943]]. He was the son of [[Áed mac Cináeda]] and first cousin of the previous ruler, [[Domnall mac Constantín]]. Constantín mac Áeda's reign is the second longest before the [[Union of the Crowns]] in 1603, exceeded only by [[William I of Scotland|William the Lion]].

==Sources==
Compared to neighbouring [[Anglo-Saxon England]] and [[Ireland]], few records of ninth and tenth century events in northern Britain survive. The main Scottish source from the period is the ''[[Chronicle of the Kings of Alba]]'', a list of kings from [[Cináed mac Ailpín]] (died 858) to [[Cináed mac Maíl Coluim]] (died 995). The list survives in the [[Poppleton Manuscript]], a thirteenth century compilation. Originally simply a list of kings with reign lengths, the other details contained in the Poppleton Manuscript version were added in the tenth and twelfth centuries.<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 87&ndash;93; Dumville, "Chronicle of the Kings of Alba".</ref> In addition to this, later king lists survive.<ref>Anderson, ''Kings and kingship'', reproduces these lists and discusses their origins.</ref> The earliest [[genealogical]] records of the descendants of Cináed mac Ailpín may date from the end of the tenth century, but their value lies more in their context, and the information they provide about the interests of those for whom they were compiled, than in the unreliable claims they contain.<ref>Broun, ''Irish origins'', pp. 133&ndash;164; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 220&ndash;221.</ref>

For narrative history the principal sources are the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' and the [[Irish annals]]. The evidence from [[charter]]s created in the [[Kingdom of England]] provides occasional insight into events in northern Britain.<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 2&ndash;3, 87&ndash;88, & 357&ndash;359.</ref> The value of [[sagas]] as sources of historical narrative, rather than documents of social history, is disputed.<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 277&ndash;285; Ó Corrain, "Vikings in Scotland and Ireland"; Sawyer & Sawyer, pp. 21&ndash;26.</ref> Mainland European sources rarely concern themselves with affairs in Britain, and even less commonly with events in northern Britain, but the life of Saint [[Cathróe of Metz]], a work of [[hagiography]] written in [[Germany]] at the end of the tenth century, provides plausible details of the Saint's early life in Britain.<ref>MaqQuarrie, pp. 199&ndash;210.</ref>

While the sources for north-eastern Britain, the lands of the kingdom of [[Northumbria]] and the former [[Picts|Pictland]], are limited and late, those for the areas on the [[Irish Sea]] and [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coasts&mdash;the modern regions of north-west England and all of norther and western Scotland&mdash;are non-existent, and [[archaeology]] and [[toponymy]]&mdash;the study of place names&mdash;are of primary importance.<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', p. 12.</ref>

==Pictland from Constantín son of Fergus to Constantín son of Cináed==
{{main|Origins of the Kingdom of Alba}}
The dominant kingdom in eastern Scotland before the [[Viking Age]] was the northern [[Picts|Pictish]] kingdom of [[Fortriu]], on the shores of the [[Moray Firth]]. By the ninth century, the [[Gaels|Gaelic]] kingdom of [[Dál Riata]] appears to have been subject to the kings of Fortriu of the family of [[Constantín mac Fergusa]]. Constantín's family dominated Fortriu from at least 789, and, if Constantín was a kinsman of [[Óengus I of the Picts|Óengus mac Fergusa]], from around 730. All this came to an end in 839 with a defeat by [[Viking]] armies reported by the ''[[Annals of Ulster]]'' in which the king of Fortriu [[Eogán mac Óengusa]] and his brother Bran, Constantín's nephews, together with the king of Dál Riata, [[Áed mac Boanta]], "and others almost innumerable" were killed.<ref>''Annals of Ulster'', s.a. 838.</ref> These deaths led to a period of instability lasting a decade when several families attempted to establish their dominance in Pictland. By around 848 [[Cináed mac Ailpín]] had emerged as the winner.<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 57&ndash;67 & 93&ndash;98; Smyth, pp. 180&ndash;185; Duncan, pp. 8&ndash;10; Bannerman, ''Scottish takeover''; Foster, pp. 107&ndash;108.</ref>

According to later accounts Cináed mac Ailpín destroyed the Picts and established the [[kingdom of Scotland]], the founding of which is dated to 843, the year in which Cináed was said to have come to power. The historical record for ninth century Scotland is meagre, but the [[Irish annals]] and the tenth century ''Chronicle of the Kings of Alba'' agree that Cináed was a Pictish king, and call him "king of the Picts". The same style is used of Cináed's brother [[Domnall mac Ailpín|Domnall]] and son [[Constantín mac Cináeda|Constantín]].<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 93&ndash;117 & 320&ndash;322; Broun, "Dunkeld"; Duncan, pp. 13&ndash;14; Herbert; Dumville, p. 76.</ref>

The kingdom ruled by Cináed's descendants&mdash;older works used the name [[House of Alpin]] to describe them but descent from Cináed<!--Clann Cináeda meic Ailpín? Broun, "Dunkeld", 102; Woolf, ?-->  appears to have been seen as the common factor<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 220&ndash;221 & 256&ndash;257.</ref>&mdash;lay to the south of the previously dominant kingdom of Fortriu, centred in the lands around the [[River Tay]]. The extent of Cináed's nameless kingdom is uncertain, but it probably reached from the [[Firth of Forth]] in the south to the [[Mounth]] in the north, and perhaps much further north. Whether it extended beyond the mountainous spine of north Britain&mdash;[[Druim Alban]]&mdash;is unclear. The core of the kingdom  was very approximately the same as the old counties of [[Kincardineshire|Mearns]], [[Forfarshire|Forfar]], [[Perthshire|Perth]], [[Fife]], and [[Kinross-shire|Kinross]]. Among the chief ecclesiastical centres named in the records are [[Dunkeld]], probably seat of the bishop of the kingdom, and ''Cell Rígmonaid'' (modern [[St Andrews]]).<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 98&ndash;101; Driscoll, pp. 33&ndash;51; Foster, pp. 8 fig. 1, 39 fig. 24., & 110&ndash;111.</ref>

Cináed's son Constantín died in 876, probably killed fighting against a Viking army which had come north from [[Northumbria]] in 874.<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 106&ndash;116; Swanton, pp. 72&ndash;75, s.a. 875.</ref> 

==Britain and Ireland at the end of the ninth century==
[[Image:Image Constantine II map.png|thumb|right|Northern Britain circa 900.]]
In 899 [[Alfred the Great]], king of [[Wessex]], died leaving his son [[Edward the Elder]] as ruler of Britain south of the [[River Thames]] and his daughter [[Æthelflæd]] and son-in-law [[Æthelred, ealdorman of Mercia|Æthelred]] ruling the western, English part of [[Mercia]]. The situation in the Danish kingdoms of eastern Britain is less clear. King [[Eohric of East Anglia|Eohric]] was probably ruling in [[East Anglia]], but no dates can reliably be assigned to the successors of [[Guthfrith, King of York|Guthfrith]] in [[Northumbria]]. It is known that Guthfrith was succeeded by Sigurd and Cnut, although whether these men ruled jointly or one after the other is uncertain. Northumbria may have been divided by this time between the Danish kings in York and the local rulers, perhaps represented by [[Eadulf I of Bernicia|Eadulf]], based at [[Bamburgh]] who controlled the lands from the [[River Tyne]] or [[River Tees]] to the Forth in the north.<ref>Keynes, "Rulers of the English"; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 138&ndash;139; Blair, pp. 75&ndash;79.</ref>

In Ireland, [[Flann Sinna]], who was married to Constantín's aunt, dominated the land. The years around 900 represented a period of weakness among the Vikings and [[Norse-Gaels]] of [[Dublin]]. They are reported to have been divided between two rival leaders. In 894 one group left Dublin, perhaps settling on the [[Irish Sea]] coast of Britain between the [[River Mersey]] and the [[Firth of Clyde]]. The remaining Dubliners were expelled in 902 by Flann Sinna's son-in-law [[Cerball mac Muirecáin]], and soon afterwards appeared in western Britain.<ref>Annals of Ulster, s.a. 893 & 902; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp 131 & 138&ndash;139.</ref>

To the south-west of Constantín's lands was the [[kingdom of Strathclyde]]. This extended north into the [[Lennox]], east to the River Forth, and south into the [[Southern Uplands]]. In 900 it was ruled by King [[Domnall I of Strathclyde|Dyfnwal]].<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 153&ndash;157.</ref> 

The situation of the Gaelic kingdoms of [[Dál Riata]] in western Scotland, which perhaps still controlled parts of [[County Antrim]] in north-east Ireland into the ninth century, is uncertain. No kings are known by name after Áed mac Boanta. The [[Francia|Frankish]] ''[[Annales Bertiniani]]'' may record the conquest of the [[Inner Hebrides]], the seaward part of Dál Riata, by Northmen in 849.<ref>Woolf, pp. 99&ndash;100 & 286&ndash;289; Anderson, ''Early Sources'', p. 277.</ref> In addition to these, the arrival of new groups of Vikings from northern and western Europe was still a commonplace. Whether there were Viking or Norse-Gael kingdoms in the [[Western Isles]] or the [[Northern Isles]] at this time is debated.<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 275&ndash;311, especially 286&ndash;289; Ó Corrain, "Vikings in Scotland and Ireland"; Crawford, pp. 39&ndash;62; Smyth, pp. 141&ndash;174.</ref>

==Early life==
[[Áed mac Cináeda|Áed]], Constantín's father, succeeded Constantín's uncle and namesake [[Constantín mac Cináeda]] in 876 but was killed in 878. Thus, althoug the date of his birth is nowhere recorded, Constantín cannot have been born any later than 879. His name, shared with his uncle, may suggest that he was born rather earlier, during the reign of Constantín mac Cináeda.<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 116&ndash;117 & 166, note 84.</ref> 

After Áed's death there is a two decade gap until the death of [[Domnall mac Constantín]] in 900 during which nothing is reported in the Irish annals.<ref>Anderson, ''Early Sources'', pp. 358&ndash;358 & 395; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 117&ndash;118.</ref> The entry for the reign between Áed and Domnall is corrupt in the ''Chronicle of the Kings of Alba'', and in this case the Chronicle is at variance with every other king list.<ref>On this, note Dumville's comments regarding [[damnatio memoriae]], Dumville, p. 75; see also Woolf, pp. 117&ndash;121.</ref> According to the Chronicle, Áed was followed by [[Eochaid of Scotland|Eochaid]], a grandson of Cináed, who is somehow connected with [[Giric mac Dúngail]], but all other lists say that Giric ruled after Áed and make great claims for him.<ref>Anderson, ''Kings and kingship'', pp. 251&ndash;252, 254, 263, 267, 274, 283,& 288.</ref> Giric is not known to have been a kinsman of Cináed's, although it has been suggested that he was related to him by marriage. The major changes in Pictland which occurred in about this period have been associated by [[Alex Woolf]] and [[Archie Duncan]] with Giric's reign.<ref>Duncan, pp. 11&ndash;16; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 117&ndash;121, 137&ndash;138, & 320&ndash;322. For an alternative view of all this, see Smyth, pp. 215&ndash;218.</ref>

Woolf suggests that Constantín and his cousin Domnall may have passed Giric's reign in exile in [[Ireland]] where their aunt Máel Muire was wife of two successive [[High Kings of Ireland]], [[Áed Findliath]] and [[Flann Sinna]].<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 122&ndash;125.</ref> Giric died in 889. If he had been in exile, Constantín will have returned to Pictland where his cousin Domnall became king. Domnall's reputation is suggested by the [[epithet]] ''dasachtach'', a word used of violent madmen and mad bulls, used of him in the eleventh century synchronisms of [[Flann Mainstreach]], echoed by the his description in the ''[[Prophecy of Berchan]]'' as "the rough one who will think relics and psalms of little worth".<ref>Anderson, ''Early Sources'', pp. cxlix & 397&ndash;398.</ref> Wars with the Viking kings in Britain and Ireland continued during Domnall's reign and he was probably killed fighting yet more Vikings at [[Dunnottar]] in the Mearns. Constantín succeeded him as king.<ref>Woolf, p. 125; Anderson, ''Early Sources'', pp. 395&ndash;398. The account of the conquest of the [[kingdom of Strathclyde]] in Domnall's time given by, for example, Smyth, pp. 217&ndash;218, is rejected by Duncan, p. 40 and Woolf, pp. 152&ndash;157.</ref>

==Vikings and bishops==
The earliest event recorded in the ''Chronicle of the Kings of Alba'' in Constantín's reign is an attack by Vikings and the plundering of Dunkeld "and all Albania" in his third year. This is the first use of the word Albania, the [[Latin]] form of the [[Old Irish language|Old Irish]] ''Alba'', in the Chronicle which hitherto described the lands ruled by the descendants of Cináed as Pictavia. The following year, the Chronicle states that the Northmen were killed in ''Srath Erenn''. This is confirmed by the ''Annals of Ulster'' which report the death of Ímar grandson of Ímar at the hands of the men of Fortriu. This correspondence was long used to locate Fortriu in [[Strathearn]], but this is now doubted as the weight of evidence suggests that Fortriu lay north of the Mounth, and also as there was a northern Strathearn in early times. An entry in the ''[[Chronicon Scotorum]]'' under the year 904 may possibly contain a garbled reference to this battle.<ref>References to the ''Chronicle of the Kings of Alba'' are to Woolf's translation, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 127&ndash;128, unless otherwise noted. Anderson, ''Early Sources'', pp. 398, 399, & 444&ndash;446; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'' p. 130; ''Annals of Ulster'', s.a. 904; ''Chronicon Scotorum'', s.a. 904.</ref>

The Chronicle of the Kings of Alba records that Constantín and bishop [[Cellach I of Cennrígmonaid|Cellach]]
{{cquote|met at ''the Hill of Belief'' near the royal city of [[Scone, Perth and Kinross|Scone]] [and] pledged themselves that the laws and disciplines of the faith, and the laws of churches and gospels, should be kept in conformity with the Scotti.}} It is supposed that if any single event may be taken to mark the birth of the [[kingdom of Alba]], then it should be this.<ref>Driscoll, ''Alba'', p. 37; Broun, "Dunkeld"; Herbert, ''Ri Éirenn, Ri Alban''.</ref>

In 914, the [[Annals of Ulster]] report the defeat of Barid son of Oitir by Ragnall grandson of Ivar in the [[Irish Sea]]. It in is the period of dominance of northern Britain by Ragnall and his cousin Sihtric that Constantín is found as an ally of [[Ealdred I of Bernicia|Ealdred]] of [[Bernicia]] and, perhaps, of Queen [[Ethelfleda]] of [[Mercia]].<ref>Woolf, "Constantine II"; FA 429, 459.</ref> Armies led by Ragnall and his brother Sihtric raided throughout northern Britain and Ireland.<ref>A partial list, for 915&ndash;918, includes: AU 915.7, 916.3, 916.6, 917.2, 917.3, 917.4, 918.3, 918.6.</ref> They attacked [[Chester]], [[Dumbarton]] and [[Northumbria]]. The [[Uí Ímair]] - the grandsons of Ivar - were the greatest threat to Alba, hence the alliance with the [[Anglo-Saxons]] of Bernicia and Mercia.

While two [[battles of Corbridge]] are claimed, in 915 and 918, only the second is mentioned by the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba and, at some length, by the Annals of Ulster and the [[Fragmentary Annals of Ireland]].<ref>CKA; AU 918.4; FA 429.</ref> The first battle rests on [[Symeon of Durham]]'s ''Historia de Sancto Cuthberto''. <ref>Woolf, "Constantine II" mentions 918 only; Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 332&ndash;333 discusses the battles and the dependence on Symeon.</ref> The location in Gaelic sources is vague, [[Corbridge]] again coming from Symeon.<ref> CKA gives ''Tinemore'', as likely to be the [[East Lothian]] Tyne as the Northumbrian [[River Tyne|Tyne]]; AU and FAI are vague.</ref>

==Later period: the English threat==
After Corbridge, Ragnall seized control of [[York]]. However, in 920, after taking direct control of Mercia soon after Ethelfleda's death, [[Edward the Elder]] forced Ragnall to acknowledge his rule. While neither of the kings may have been happy with the compromise of 920, neither did they live long enough to break the treaty. Ragnall died in 921, succeeded by his cousin [[Sihtric Cáech]]. Edward died in 924, followed by [[Ælfweard of Wessex|Ælfweard]], who reigned for a very short time, succeeded by his half-brother [[Athelstan of England|Athelstan]]. Sihtric may have rebelled in 924, but by 926 he had evidently acknowledged Athelstan as over-king, adopting [[Christianity]] and marrying a sister of Athelstan at [[Tamworth]]. Within the year Sihtric abandoned his new faith and repudiated his unwanted wife. Before Athelstan and he could fight, Sihtric died suddenly in 927.<ref>Higham, ''Kingdom of Northumbria'', pp. 186&ndash;190; Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 339&ndash;340.</ref>

Athelstan moved quickly, seizing much of [[Northumbria]], and securing the submission of Sihtric's  brother Gofraid (or Guthfrith), of Ealdred of Bernicia, of Constantín, and of [[Eógan I of Strathclyde|Owain]] of Strathclyde. Sihtric's young son [[Amlaíb Cuaran]] (Olaf Sihtricsson) fled to Ireland. In less than a decade, the kingdom of [[Wessex]] had become by far the greatest power in Britain and Ireland, and whatever threat the Vikings, or the early [[Uí Ímair]], had posed, clearly the main threat to Alba was now to the south.<ref>Woolf, "Constantine II"; Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 339&ndash;340.</ref> As if to prove the point, Athelstan imposed his authority on the kings of [[Wales]], [[Hywel Dda]] and [[Idwal Foel]] among them.<ref>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 340&ndash;341.</ref>

==Brunanburh and after==
By the 930s, Constantín, his son-in-law [[Amlaíb mac Gofraid]] (or Olaf Guthfrithsson), the Uí Ímair king of [[Dublin]], perhaps together with Owain of Strathclyde, are found in alliance,certainly directed against Athelstan. In 934, Athelstan led "a great army and fleet" into Scotland and laid waste to the country. If this was intended to bring about Constantín's submission, it appears to have failed in the long term.<ref>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle; Woolf, "Constantine II"; Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 342.</ref> In the shorter term, it appears to have succeeded as Constantine witnessed a  charter with Athelstan at [[Buckingham]] on [[13 September]] [[934]]. In this he is described as ''subregulus'', that is a king acknowledging Athelstan's overlordship.<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 166&ndash;168; {{cite web|url=http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=get&type=charter&id=426 |title=Charter S 426 |last=Miller |first=Sean |work=Anglo-Saxons.net |accessdate=2007-11-28 }}</ref> The following year, Constantín was again in England at Athelstan's court, this time at [[Cirencester]] where he appears as a witness, appearing as the first of several subject kings, followed by Owain of Strathclyde and [[Hywel Dda]], ruler of the [[kingdom of Gwynedd]], who subscribed to the diploma.<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 166&ndash;168; only a part of this charter survives, see {{cite web |url=http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/kemble/pelteret/Lsp/Lsp%2011.htm |accessdate=2007-11-28 |title=Charter S 1792 |work=Anglo-Saxon Charters Website }}</ref>

In 937, the [[battle of Brunanburh]] was a notable victory for Athelstan and his brother [[Edmund I of England|Edmund]] over Constantín, Amlaíb and Owain. It is commemorated in an [[Old English poetry|Old English poem]].<ref>The poem is recorded in the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]; AU 937.6, portrays the battle as being fought between the Norsemen and the Saxons; CKA.</ref> Owain of Strathclyde is supposed to have died in the battle, as did Cellach son of Constantín.<ref>CKA; Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.</ref> The report of the deaths of Dubucán son of Indrechtach, [[Mormaer of Angus]], Eochaid son of Alpín and of Athelstan follow that for Brunanburh, and may be related to the period  937&ndash;939.<ref>CKA.</ref>

For all that Brunanburh was a great victory, it does not appear to have been sufficient to make rule by the West Saxon kings popular in the [[Danelaw]] and [[Northumbria]]. On 27 October, 939, at [[Malmesbury, Wiltshire|Malmesbury]], as the Annals of Ulster report: "Athelstan, king of the Saxons, pillar of the dignity of the western world, died an untroubled death."<ref>AU 839.6</ref> Before the end of 939, Amlaíb mac Gofraid had seized York without resistance. In 940, he gained control of the Danelaw with little fighting, a treaty being signed with the new West Saxon king, Athelstan's brother Edmund, at the prompting of the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, near [[Leicester]]. The following year, Amlaíb turned north, on Bernicia, campaigning as far as [[Tyninghame]] in East Lothian, but he died that year, being succeeded by his cousin Amlaíb Cuaran.<ref>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 356&ndash;358.</ref>

==Abdication and posterity==
The Chronicle of the Kings of Alba states:
{{cquote|And in his old age, being decrepit, [Constantín] took the staff [i.e. entered a monastery], and served the Lord; and he gave up the kingdom to Máel [Coluim] son of Domnall.}}The monastery is assumed to have been that of the [[Céli Dé]] at [[St Andrews]], probably founded in its Céli Dé form during the reign of Constantín.<ref>Woolf, "Constantine II".</ref>

The Chronicle is not done with Constantín however. It states that in the seventh year of Maél Coluim's reign:
{{cquote|[H]e plundered the English as far as the river Tees, and he seized a multitude of people and many herds of cattle: and the Scots called this the raid of Albidosorum, that is, Nainndisi. But others say that Constantín made this raid, asking of the king, Máel Coluim, that the kingship should be given to him for a week's time, so that he could visit the English. In fact, it was Máel Coluim who made the raid, but Constantín incited him, as I have said.}} Constantín's death is recorded by the Chronicle in 952:
{{cquote|And Constantín died in [Maél Coluim's] 10th year [952], under the crown of penitence in good old age.<ref>CKA; cf AU 952.1 where Constantín's death is reported amongst ecclesiastics.</ref>}} 

Constantín's son Cellach died at Brunanburh and a daughter married Amlaíb mac Gofraidh. Constantín himself may have had a Norse or [[Hiberno-Norse]] wife as his son [[Idulb mac Constantín|Idulb]] had a gaelicised Norse name.<ref>Walker suggests that the name may represent the Anglo-Saxon Eadwulf, given as Etulbb in the ''Annals of Ulster'', s.a. 913; see Walker, p. 97.</ref>  The line of kings descended from Causantín appears to have ended with the deaths of his great-grandson [[Constantín mac Culéin]] in 997. Nonetheless, the kingdom which he had created existed in much the same form until the [[Scotto-Norman]] reforming kings [[David I of Scotland|David I]], and his grandsons [[Malcolm IV of Scotland|Máel Coluim IV]] and [[William I of Scotland|William the Lion]], brought about a new form of Scottish kingship in the 12th century.
