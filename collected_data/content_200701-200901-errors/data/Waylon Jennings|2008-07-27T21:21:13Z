'''Waylon Arnold Jennings''' ([[June 15]] [[1937]] &ndash; [[February 13]] [[2002]]) was an influential [[United States of America|American]] [[country music]] [[singer]] and [[musician]].  A self-taught guitar player, he rose to prominence as a [[bass guitar|bass]] player for [[Buddy Holly]] following the break-up of [[The Crickets]].  He escaped death in the [[February 3]], [[1959]] [[The Day the Music Died|plane crash]] that took the lives of Buddy Holly, [[Richie Valens]], and J. P. "[[The Big Bopper]]" Richardson when he gave up his seat to the latter.<ref>[http://www.fiftiesweb.com/crash.htm The Day the Music Died, the Crash that killed Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
After a brief performing and recording career in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Arizona]] he moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Tennessee]], where he did not fit in with the tightly organized music industry in that city.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}  By the 1970s, he had become associated with so-called "[[outlaw country|outlaws]]," an informal group of musicians who worked outside of the Nashville corporate scene.   A series of duet albums with [[Willie Nelson]] in the late 1970s culminated in the [[1979 in country music|1978 crossover hit]], "[[Mamas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys]]". In 1979, he recorded the theme song for the hit television show ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]'', and also served as the narrator ("The Balladeer") for all seven seasons of the show.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078607/ "The Dukes of Hazzard" (1979)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

He continued to be active in the recording industry, forming the group [[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|The Highwaymen]] with  Nelson, [[Johnny Cash]], and [[Kris Kristofferson]]. Jennings released his last solo studio album in 1998. In 2001, he was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]].<ref>[http://www.countrymusichalloffame.com/site/inductees.aspx?cid=131 WAYLON JENNINGS | Country Music Hall of Fame® and Museum | Nashville, Tennessee<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Early life and career==
Jennings was born in [[Littlefield, Texas|Littlefield]], [[Texas]], the son of Lorene Beatrice (née Shipley) and William Alvin Jennings.<ref>[http://www.wargs.com/other/jennings.html Ancestry of Shooter Jennings<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> His father taught him how to play [[guitar]] at age eight, and formed his first band two years later. He worked at a [[radio station]] [[disc jockey|DJ]] throughout his adolescence, and dropped out of high school to pursue a career in music.{{Fact|date=April 2008}} During his time working as a DJ, he befriended [[Buddy Holly]]. When he was 21, Jennings was tapped by Holly to play bass in Holly's new band on a tour through the [[Midwest]] in early 1959. Holly also hired the guitarist, [[Tommy Allsup]] and [[drum]]mer [[Carl Bunch|Carl "Goose" Bunch]] for the "Winter Dance Party" tour.<ref>[http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1452295/02142002/holly_buddy.jhtml CMT.com : Buddy Holly : Waylon’s Buddy: Jennings Never Forgot His Mentor<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

During the early morning hours of [[The Day the Music Died|February 3, 1959]], the charter [[Fixed-wing aircraft|airplane]] carrying [[Buddy Holly]], [[Ritchie Valens]] and [[The Big Bopper|J.P. Richardson]] (aka "The Big Bopper") crashed outside [[Clear Lake, Iowa|Clear Lake]], [[Iowa]], killing all on board. Jennings had given his seat to Richardson, who had the [[flu]] and desperately needed rest {{Fact|date=April 2008}} In his 1996 [[autobiography]], Jennings admitted that in the years afterward, he felt severe guilt and responsibility for the crash; after Jennings gave up his seat, Holly had jokingly told Jennings,  
"I hope your ole bus freezes up!" Jennings shot back facetiously, "I hope your damn plane crashes!"<ref name=Jennings>VH1's Behind the Music "The Day the Music Died" interview with Waylon Jennings</ref>

==Phoenix==
After several years of inactivity, during which time he moved from [[Texas]] to [[Arizona]] and continued working in [[radio]], Jennings began performing and recording again, this time in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Arizona]]. He performed at a newly-opened nightspot called JD's. In those years of two and three shows a night, sometimes six nights a week, singing a variety of [[Folk music|folk]], [[Rock 'n' Roll]], [[Popular music|pop]], [[Country music|country]], [[R&B]] and [[blues]] material, he developed a unique sound, a devoted following, and made a decent living.{{Fact|date=April 2008}} He signed a contract with [[Herb Alpert|Herb Alpert's]] newly-formed [[A&M Records]], and he had a few hit singles on local radio in Phoenix, including "[[Four Strong Winds]]" ( written by [[Ian Tyson]]) and "Just To Satisfy You" (co-written with Don Bowman). [[Duane Eddy]] and [[Bobby Bare]] recommended Jennings to [[Music producer|producer]] [[Chet Atkins]], who signed Waylon to [[RCA Victor]]. [[Bobby Bare]] did his own [[Cover version|cover]] of "Four Strong Winds" after hearing Jenning's version. Still under contract to A&M, Alpert released him, allowing him to sign with [[RCA Records]]. Jennings packed up and moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Tennessee]] in 1965.

==The Nashville Sound==
Jennings was accustomed to performing and recording with his own band, The Waylors; this was a practice that was not encouraged by Nashville producers who controlled nearly every aspect of recording. Jennings and Atkins, however, developed a rapport, and had a number of moderately successful hits.{{Fact|date=April 2008}} Over time, however, Jennings felt limited by the [[Nashville Sound]] and the lack of artistic freedom that came with it in the 1960s country music industry.

[[Image:Jessi Colter and husband Waylon Jennings.jpg|left|thumb|160px|Jennings and [[Jessi Colter]]]]
His second marriage, to Lynn Jones, ended in a 1967 [[divorce]] suit that left the already broke singer economically crippled.{{Fact|date=April 2008}} He got married for a third time to Barbara Rood, who tried to get his finances under control. Her efforts created great resentment within Jennings' band {{Fact|date=April 2008}}, and the marriage ended in divorce shortly thereafter. He married for the fourth and final time to [[Jessi Colter]] in 1969. Colter (then known as Miriam Eddy) had been married to guitar legend [[Duane Eddy]]. With help of Jennings, Colter became a country singer in her own right for a brief period of time during the 1970s, best-known for her 1975 Country-Pop smash, "[[I'm Not Lisa]]".

Jennings had been growing more frustrated with the Nashville recording scene, and a 1972 bout with [[hepatitis]] almost killed him. With his [[recording contract]] nearing an end, RCA had already lost another creative force that year: Jennings had met [[Willie Nelson]], who had likewise been frustrated by the lack of freedom in the studio and by the entire Nashville [[ethos]], which led him to relocate his base to Texas two years earlier. Jennings was seriously considering leaving Nashville and returning to a [[broadcasting]] career in Phoenix that year.

==Outlaw==
Two things came along to turn Jennings' hard times around. The first was a business manager from [[New York City]] named Neil Reshen, and the second was his old friend [[Willie Nelson]].  Reshen approached Jennings, still recovering from hepatitis, and offered to re-negotiate his recording and touring contracts.  Jennings agreed, and the contract re-negotiation began in earnest. At a 1972 meeting in a Nashville airport, Jennings introduced Reshen to Nelson. By the end of the meeting, Reshen was manager to both [[singers]]. By that time, Jennings was aware of the fact that rock bands had almost unprecedented creative freedom to record what they wanted to record, with or without a producer and even to design their album covers. He wanted similar freedom for himself&mdash;an unprecedented move in 1972 Nashville. Also in 1972, RCA issued ''Ladies Love Outlaws'', an album that Jennings never wanted released. Nevertheless, the title track is often considered the first song of the [[outlaw country]] movement.

Reshen drove a hard bargain, but RCA finally agreed to his terms: a $75,000 advance and near-complete artistic control. Re-negotiations of his touring contracts yielded similar positive results, and he began turning a profit from his touring (almost unheard-of in Nashville at that time). Waylon finally had a rock star recording contract, and he looked the part; Reshen had advised him to keep the beard he had grown in the hospital, in order to cultivate a more rock and roll image.
 
By 1973, Nelson had returned to the music industry under the auspices of [[Atlantic Records]], and was on his way to music superstardom. 

Now based in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Texas]], Nelson had made inroads into the rock and roll press by attracting a diverse fan base that included the young rock music audience. Atlantic Records had signed Nelson when the time was right, and they were looking to sign Jennings as well. Nelson's rise to popularity made RCA nervous about losing another hot artist, which gave Jennings the leverage he needed in his contract re-negotiations. 

He followed with ''Lonesome, On'ry and Mean'' and ''Honky Tonk Heroes'' in 1973, the first albums recorded and released under his own creative control. The albums were huge commercial and critical successes. More hit albums followed, with ''The Ramblin' Man'' and ''This Time'', in 1974, and ''Dreaming My Dreams'' in 1975. The pace of recording and performing was lucrative but grueling. 

In 1976, Jennings came up and helped an old friend of his who was concerting in Toronto, Canada. The friend's guitarist was out sick, and Jennings "Had a week free in Nashville", so he came to help. The friend consented on the condition that they sing together. The friend was his former roommate [[Johnny Cash]].

In 1976, Jennings began his career-defining collaborations with Nelson on the compilation album ''Wanted: The Outlaws!'', country's first [[RIAA certification|platinum]] record. The following year, RCA issued "Ol' Waylon", an album that produced another huge hit duet with Nelson, "[[Luckenbach, Texas (Back to the Basics of Love)]]". ''Waylon and Willie'' followed in 1978, producing their biggest hit with "[[Mamas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys]]". He released ''I've Always Been Crazy'' in 1978, followed with a "[[greatest hits]]" album in 1979. 

By the early 1980s, Jennings was completely addicted to cocaine. His personal finances had again unraveled, leaving him [[bankrupt]], though he insisted on repaying every penny and did additional tours to satisfy the [[debt]]. His work became less focused, and his tours had progressed into full rock and roll-type excesses. In a widely publicized case, he was arrested in 1977 for cocaine possession by federal agents, though due to almost comedic errors by the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]], the charges were later dropped. The episode was recounted in Jennings' song "Don't You Think This Outlaw Bit's Done Got out of Hand?"

==Addiction and recovery==	 
Jennings decided that it was finally time to clean up, at least for a little while. He underwent the [[detoxification|detox]] process, intending to start using cocaine again in a more controlled fashion afterward. By Jennings' own admission in interviews, his son, [[Shooter Jennings]], was the main inspiration to stay off of cocaine permanently. In 1984, he went "[[cold turkey]]" to end his cocaine addiction for good. His later life was plagued with health problems including a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and [[diabetes]] brought on by a voracious appetite that developed after he beat his cocaine habit. Despite these problems, Jennings remained free from cocaine and continued recording and touring throughout the 1980s and 1990s, and into the new millennium. Jennings performed his final concert in late fall of 2001.

==Later years==

Outside the music industry, Jennings was also known as the voice of the narrator on the popular [[television]] series "[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]" and its predecessor, the 1975 film, "[[Moonrunners]]". The theme song, "Good Ol' Boys", an original Jennings composition, is one of the most well-known television theme songs in American television history. He also made an appearance on "[[Married... with Children]]" and had a cameo role in the 1985 film, ''[[Sesame Street presents Follow That Bird]]''. Jennings sang "Ain't No Road Too Long" in the movie with [[Big Bird]], and the other "[[Sesame Street]]" characters. Jennings was also a member of [[USA for Africa]] for the recording of "[[We Are the World]]", but temperamental as ever, reportedly left the studio due to a dispute over the song's lyrics. In the early 70's, after Cash's guitar player fell ill while on tour in Canada, Waylon flew up from Nashville, where he had a free week, and filled in. Afterwards; after several solos and duets, Jennings refused to take payment for it.<ref>CASH, the Autobiograpy, Cash, Johnny 1997 Random House Inc. </ref>

In the mid-1980s, [[Johnny Cash]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], Nelson, and Jennings formed a successful group called [[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|The Highwaymen]]. Aside from his work with The Highwaymen, highlights from his own career include ''[[WWII (album)|WWII]]'' with Willie Nelson in 1982, ''[[Will the Wolf Survive]]'' in 1985, ''[[The Eagle (album)|The Eagle]]'' in 1990 and ''[[Too Dumb for New York City, Too Ugly for L.A.]]'' in 1992.

During the early 1990s, Jennings became good friends with the members of the group, [[Metallica]]. He had also become very close to Metallica frontman [[James Hetfield]], and influenced some material for their 1996 album ''[[Load (album)|Load]]''. In 2003, James Hetfield was featured on the tribute album ''I've Always Been Crazy: A Tribute to Waylon Jennings'', covering Jennings' "Don't You Think This Outlaw Bit's Done Got Out of Hand?"

In 1998, Jennings teamed up with [[Bobby Bare]], [[Jerry Reed]] and [[Mel Tillis]] to form The [[Old Dogs]]. The group recorded a double album of songs penned entirely by [[Shel Silverstein]]. In July, 1998, the [[Old Dogs]], Volumes 1 and 2 were released on the [[Atlantic Records]] label. A companion video, as well as a Greatest Hits album (composed of previously released material by each individual artist), were also available.

In mid 1999 Jennings assembled what he referred to as being his "hand-picked dream team" - forming Waylon & The Waymore Blues Band. Consisting primarily of former Waylors, the thirteen-member group performed a limited number of concerts at select venues from 1999 to 2001. The highlight of this period was the January 2000 recording, at Nashville's historic [[Ryman Auditorium]], of what would become Jennings' final album, [[Never Say Die: Live]]. An abbreviated album, composed of 14 tracks, was released in October 2000. A special edition box set, including all twenty-two tracks on two audio CDs, as well as a DVD with the complete concert and bonus features, was released on [[July 24]], [[2007]] from [[Legacy Recordings]].

Some time during 2001, Jennings provided his voice in an episode of ''[[Family Guy]]'' during a ''Dukes of Hazzard'' parody (which would end up being his last televised appearance). The episode was entitled ''[[To Love and Die in Dixie]]''. The episode originally aired in November of that year. He also narrated a watch fight in an earlier episode, ''[[Chitty Chitty Death Bang]]''.

In October 2001 Jennings was finally inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. In one final act of defiance, he did not show up to accept the award, opting instead to send his son Buddy Dean Jennings in his place.
 
It is said that for the rest of his life, he lamented over the last words he and Buddy Holly exchanged.
      '''Buddy:''' Ain't you gettin' on, Waylon?
      '''Waylon:''' No, I'm not feelin' too good about flying.
      '''Buddy:''' Well, I hope yer ol' bus freezes up.
      '''Waylon:''' I hope your damn plane crashes.

==Death==
Jennings suffered from worsening [[diabetes]] that had ended all but abbreviated touring. On [[December 19]], [[2001]], his left foot was amputated in a [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Arizona]] hospital due to infection arising from his diabetes. Then, on [[February 13]], [[2002]], Jennings died in his sleep of diabetic complications in [[Chandler, Arizona|Chandler]], [[Arizona]]. He is interred in the Mesa City Cemetery, [[Mesa, Arizona|Mesa]], [[Arizona]].

==Posthumous==
In the 2005 [[Academy Award]]-winning [[Johnny Cash]] biopic ''[[Walk the Line]]'', Waylon was portrayed by his son, [[Shooter Jennings|Shooter]], as a tribute to him, though the younger man's shoulder-length hair and beard made him look nothing like his father had appeared at the time (circa 1966) when Cash and Jennings shared an apartment outside Nashville.  Shooter also plays his father in a scene set several years previously; for this scene he did cut his hair and shave, heightening the resemblance to Waylon.

On [[March 22]], [[2006]], Jennings' mother Lorene Beatrice (nee [[Shipley]]) Jennings died in [[Littlefield, Texas|Littlefield]], [[Texas]], at the age of 84.

On [[July 6]], [[2006]], Jennings was inducted to Hollywood's Rock Wall in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]], [[California]] along with former bandmate Kris Kristofferson.

In 2006 Jennings received a tribute from John Schneider, Tom Wopat and Catherine Bach (Bo, Luke and Daisy Duke). Waylon composed the theme song [[Theme from "The Dukes of Hazzard" (Good Ol' Boys)]] and was also the Balladeer (narrator) on the show.

Schneider, Wopat and Bach reworked the theme song, added to it and re-recorded it. They also made a video for the song which is on the 7th season Dukes of Hazzard DVD set. The song ends with Daisy (Catherine Bach) saying "we love you Waylon" as the music fades out. This project was done with the blessing of Waylon's widow, [[Jessi Colter]].

On [[June 20]], [[2007]] Jennings was posthumously awarded the [[Cliffie Stone Pioneer Award]] by the [[Academy of Country Music]]. Jennings' son, [[Buddy Dean Jennings]] accepted the award on his late father's behalf.
