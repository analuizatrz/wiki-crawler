[[Sociolinguistics Research]] in India: 
A research done in a society with the emphasis on linguistic situation is a [[Sociolinguistics Research]][http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociolinguistics].
'''[[India]]''' is one of the multilingual nations, where there are many big and small languages are spoken. A '''[[Sociolinguistics]]''' Research would be very much apt to in such situation. Many people are studying or doing their Ph. D by doing research but only few have concentrated on the sociolinguistics situation of India. There are also other people who do research for the community development, language development etc. [[Gangadhar B. Amar]] feels happy about himself for doing such research. However, he realizes that his involvement in this is just a tiny drop in the ocean of [[sociolinguistics research]]. So it seems there is a big work waiting for us... to see the Indian languages being developed. For that we need to start with sociolinguistics research.
