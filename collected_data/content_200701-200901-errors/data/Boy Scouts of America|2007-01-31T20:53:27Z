The '''Boy Scouts of America''' ('''BSA''') is a [[United States of America|United States]] [[Scouting]] organization, with some presence in other countries.  The BSA is the largest [[youth organization]] in the United States; over one hundred million Americans have been members. Founded in 1910, the [[Social movement|movement]] had a registered membership of 2,938,698 youth with 1,146,130 leaders in 122,582 units as of the end of 2005.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.scouting.org/media/review/2005.html | title =Year in Review: 2005 | format = | work = | publisher =Boy Scouts of America | accessdate =2006-07-19}}</ref>  The BSA is administered mostly by committees of volunteers, but employs professionals at the higher levels of administration and for commercial activities.

The BSA sprang from the concerns of the [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive movement in the United States]] from people who sought to promote the [[social welfare]] of young men. The BSA adheres to the [[Scout method]] to teach values such as [[self-esteem]], [[citizenship]], and [[outdoors]]manship through a variety of outdoor activities such as [[camping]], [[aquatics]], and [[hiking]].<ref name="vision">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.scouting.org/nav/enter.jsp?s=mc&c=mv | title =Mission Statement and Vision Statement | format = | work = | publisher =Boy Scouts of America | accessdate =2006-10-10}}</ref><ref name="mbcom">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.meritbadge.com/info/aims.htm | title =Boy Scout Aims and Methods | format = | work = | publisher = Meritbadge.com | accessdate =2006-10-27}}</ref>  

The BSA recognizes the achievements of Scouts through advancement in rank and various special awards.  It includes several program divisions, targeted at boys ages seven through seventeen and young men and women ages fourteen through twenty-one.  The BSA operates locally, through volunteer-led units such as troops, packs, and crews.

==Origins==
{{main|History of the Boy Scouts of America}}
The [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive movement]] in the United States was at its height during the early twentieth century.  With the migration of families from rural to urban centers, there were concerns that young men were no longer learning patriotism and individualism.  The [[YMCA]] was an early promoter of [[social welfare]] and other reforms involving young men.  [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Baden-Powell]] started [[Scouting]] in 1907 and the [[Social movement|movement]] began to grow.

In 1909, Chicago publisher [[William D. Boyce|W. D. Boyce]] was visiting [[London, England]] where he learned of the Scouting movement.   Upon his return to the US, Boyce incorporated the Boy Scouts of America on [[February 8]], [[1910]].  The YMCA became interested in the nascent BSA program and provided support.  The first managing secretary was John M. Alexander, succeeded by Edgar M. Robinson, both from the YMCA.  [[James E. West (Scouting)|James E. West]] took over as managing secretary and later as [[Chief Scout Executive]], beginning a long relationship with the BSA.

==Ideals==
[[Image:OnMyHonor4k.jpg|thumb|150px|BSA "Strategic Plan Identity" emblem]]
The stated objectives of the BSA are referred to as "Aims of Scouting": character development, citizenship training, and personal fitness. Each of the programs of the BSA pursues these aims through methods that are designed to be appropriate for the age and maturity of the participants.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.scouting.org/boyscouts/resources/18-813/basic.html | title =Basic Leader Training | format = | work = | publisher =Boy Scouts of America | accessdate =2006-10-10}}</ref>  One of these methods is the establishment of ideals.  These are statements of goals against which each boy can measure and improve himself.  For Boy Scouts and Varsity Scouts, these ideals are reflected in the [[Scout Oath]], [[Scout Law|Law]], Motto and Slogan.  There are similar sets of ideals for Cub Scouts and Venturers.

;The '''Scout Motto'''
:''Be Prepared.''
;The '''Scout Slogan'''
:''Do a Good Turn Daily.''
;The '''Scout Oath'''
:''On my honor, I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country and to obey the Scout Law; to help other people at all times; to keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight.''
;The '''Scout Law'''
:''A Scout is trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean and reverent.''
;The '''Outdoor Code'''
:''As an American, I will do my best to be clean in my outdoor manners, be careful with fire, be considerate in the outdoors, and be conservation-minded.''
;The '''Scout Sign'''
:The upper arm is held horizontally out to the right side, and the forearm is held vertically.  The palm of the hand faces forward, with the first three fingers extended and the tips of the little finger and thumb joined.
;The '''Scout Salute'''
:The hand is held in the same configuration as is used for the Scout Sign, with the tip of the index finger (pointer) touching the forehead or hat brim.  This is a modification of the [[salute]] used by military organizations around the world.
;The '''Scout Handshake'''
:This is the traditional [[handshake]] done with the left hand instead of the right.  Several conflicting reasons have been given for this modification:
:*The left hand is closer to one's [[heart]].
:*A soldier must keep his right hand free to grab his weapon.  
:*In warfare using simple weapons (practiced in the [[medieval]] period, as well as by the Ashanti people that [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Baden-Powell]] met in West Africa), a warrior carries a shield in his left hand.  To shake with the left hand, he must drop his shield, indicating good faith.<ref>{{cite web | last =Foster | first =Rev.

The BSA Scout Oath and Law have remained unchanged since they were first developed in 1910.

==Membership==
The BSA has three membership divisions:
*'''[[Cub Scouts (Boy Scouts of America)|Cub Scouting]]''', the largest of the three divisions, is available to boys from first-grade through fifth-grade, (seven through ten years old) and their families. The Cub Scout program uses a fun and challenging system to pursue the aims of character development, citizenship training, and personal fitness.<ref name="vision"/> The program is divided into age-based programs of Tiger Cubs, Wolf Cubs, Bear Cubs and Webelos.

*'''[[Boy Scouts (Boy Scouts of America)|Boy Scouting]]''' is the flagship program of the BSA for boys ten through seventeen.  The program uses a system of outdoor activities to achieve the aims of Scouting.  '''[[Varsity Scouts (Boy Scouts of America)|Varsity Scouts]]''' is a modified Boy Scout program available to boys from fourteen through eighteen that adds a system of [[High Adventure]] and sporting activities to appeal to the older boy, with an emphasis on team competition.  The '''[[Order of the Arrow]]''' (OA) is the Boy Scout national honor society for experienced campers, based on Native American traditions, and dedicated to the ideal of cheerful service and brotherhood.
*'''[[Venturing (Boy Scouts of America)|Venturing]]''' is the program for young men and women ages fourteen through twenty-one.<ref name="venturerage">Venturer Application 28-303K: "Venturers registered in a crew or ship prior to their twenty-first birthday may continue as members after their 21st birthday until the crew or ship recharters or they reach their twenty-second birthday, whichever comes first."</ref> Its purpose is to provide positive experiences to help youth mature and to prepare them to become responsible adults.  According to its website, <!--Google gives 2B hits for "website", 600M for "web site".  Also note that on Wikipedia, "web site" is redirected to the "website" article.  I think that "website" is the standard term.-->Venturing is based on a unique and dynamic relationship between youth, adult leaders, and organizations in their communities.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.scouting.org/factsheets/02-388.html | title =What is Venturing | format = | work =Fact Sheet | publisher =Boy Scouts of America | accessdate =2006-10-10}}</ref>  '''[[Sea Scouts (Boy Scouts of America)|Sea Scouting]]''' is the nautical oriented part of this division.

==Organization==
===National Council===
The National Council of the BSA is registered as a [[non-profit]] private corporation and is funded from private donations, membership dues, corporate sponsors, and special events.  The National Council is led by the National Executive Board, a volunteer board of directors that is directed by the national president.  Paid professional Scouters perform the administrative tasks of the organization as directed by the [[Chief Scout Executive]]&mdash; a position currently held by [[Roy Williams (Scouting)|Roy Williams]].  The National Council develops programs, sets standards for training, provides for leadership selection, sets uniform policies, maintains registration records, develops supporting literature, establishes advancement standards.<ref>{{cite web | last = Nelson | first = Bill | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year =  | url = http://www.usscouts.org/aboutbsa/bsaorg.html | title = Organization of the Boy Scouts of America | format =  | work = U.S. Scouting Service Project | publisher =  | accessdate = 2006-03-13}}</ref>  The National Office is currently located in [[Irving, Texas]].  Sea Scouts use the term ''fleet'' instead of National Council of the BSA.

===Regions and areas===
[[Image:RegionMap copy.jpg|thumb|right|300px|<center>BSA Regions</center>]]
The BSA is divided into four regions (Western, Central, Southern and Northeast).  Each region is subdivided into areas, about six per region.  These are then divided into local councils, the BSA's main administrative level (as of 2006, a total of 304).  Sea Scouts refer to a region as a flotilla and the area as a task force. Councils are subdivided into districts, which in turn directly interact with BSA's units.

===Local councils===
:''Main category: [[:Category:Boy Scouts of America Local Councils|Boy Scouts of America Local Councils]]''

Areas are divided into local councils; referred to as squadrons by Sea Scouts.  The vast bulk of councils of the Boy Scouts of America have gone through thousands of name changes, merges, splits and re-creations since the necessity for the concept in the 1910s.  A council's chief officer is the Scout Executive (sometimes called the council executive), a paid employee, who administers a staff of professional Scouters (typically district executives). The council president, a volunteer, serves as the chairman of a volunteer board of directors. Finally the council commissioner, also a volunteer, coordinates the efforts of trained volunteers who provide direct service to the units.  These three officials together are known as the "Key 3."
[[Image:Philly_Scout.png|thumb|left|Bruce S. Marks Scout Resource Center]]

The BSA maintains two councils for Scouts who live overseas, largely on military bases in Europe and Asia.  The [[American Scouting overseas#Transatlantic Council|Transatlantic Council]], headquartered in Germany, serves US Scouts in much of Europe, and the [[American Scouting overseas#Far East Council|Far East Council]], headquartered in Japan, serves several nations in the western Pacific.  Additionally, the [[American Scouting overseas#Direct Service|Direct Service]] branch makes the Scouting program available to US citizens and their dependents living in countries outside these jurisdictions or in isolated areas.  The Hawaiian [[Scouting in Hawaii#Aloha Council|Aloha Council]] services the American territories of [[American Samoa]], [[Guam]], the [[Northern Marianas Islands]] and also provides Scouting to the sovereign countries of the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], the [[Marshall Islands]] and [[Palau]].

===Boroughs===
Because of the high density of units, the Greater New York Councils<!---sic---> is divided into five boroughs with each led by a borough Scout executive.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.bsa-gnyc.org/ | title =Greater New York Councils | format = | work = | publisher = | accessdate =2006-08-08}}</ref>  Each borough  is then divided into districts.

===Districts===
Councils are divided into districts with leadership provided by the district executive, district chairman, and the district commissioner.  Districts are directly responsible for the operation of Scouting units and, except for the district executive, are mostly staffed with volunteers.

===Units===
The unit is the main program group of the BSA.  Cub Scouts are organized as packs, Boy Scouts as troops, Varsity Scouts as teams, Venturers as crews, and Sea Scouts as ships.  Each unit is sponsored by a community organization such as a business, service organization, school, labor group or religious institution. The chartering organization is responsible for selecting leadership, providing a meeting place, and promoting a good program. The chartered organization representative is the liaison between the unit, the chartered organization, and the BSA.

The unit is lead by a registered and trained leader (Cubmaster, Scoutmaster, Coach, Advisor or Skipper) with one or more assistants. The unit committee is a group of adults, led by the committee chairman, who plan the unit program and activities and manage record keeping, finance, leadership recruitment and registration.

==Activities==
===Publications===
BSA publishes two magazines: [[Scouting magazine|Scouting]] is targeted towards adult leaders while [[Boys' Life]] is for the youth. Boys' Life is published in two editions; one for Boy Scouts and one for Cub Scouts. The Boy Scout edition contains a certain amount of material targeted toward boys aged eleven through eighteen, while the Cub Scout edition contains material targeted toward boys aged six through ten. If subscription is obtained through registration in the Boy Scouts of America program, the publisher will select the appropriate edition based on the boy's status as a Boy Scout or Cub Scout.

===Support and Service Divisions===
There are several divisions that provide support and service to the main Scouting program:

The ScoutReach Division emphasizes service to rural and urban areas, and includes the [[American Indian Scouting Association]] and the Scouting - Vale La Pena program for Hispanic youth.<ref>{{cite web  | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year =  | url = http://www.scoutreachbsa.org/ | title = ScoutReach Division&ndash; BSA | format =  | work =  | publisher = Boy Scouts of America | accessdate = 2006-03-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year =  | url =  http://www.scoutingvalelapena.org/ | title = Scouting - Vale La Pena | format =  | work =

Jamboree Division provides support for the world and national jamborees.  The International Division is responsible for relations with other Scout and Guide organizations.  It includes the Interamerican Scout Foundation and [[Direct Service]].<ref>{{cite web | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year =  | url = http://www.interamfoundation.org/ | title = Interamerican Scout Foundation | format =  | work =  | publisher =  | accessdate =2006-03-13}}</ref>  The Relationships Division is responsible for relations with supporting organizations outside the BSA, including the [[AFL-CIO]], [[Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks|Elks]], [[Veterans of Foreign Wars|VFW]] and all religious associations and awards.<ref>{{cite web | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year =  | url = http://www.scouting.org/relationships/index.html | title = Relationships Division | format =  | work =  | publisher = Boy Scouts of America | accessdate = 2006-03-13}}</ref>  Supply Division is responsible for uniforms and apparel, insignia, literature and equipment.  It includes the  National Supply Group that sells equipment through Scout Shops, authorized resellers and the online ScoutStuff.org.<ref>{{cite web | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year =  | url = http://ScoutStuff.org | title = ScoutStuff.org | format =  | work =  | publisher = Boy Scouts of America | accessdate = 2006-03-13}}</ref>

The Marketing and Communications Division, Finance Support Division, Human Resources Administration Division, Professional Development Division, Compensation and Benefits Division and Information Services Division provide internal administrative service and support.

===Finance===

In 2004, BSA ranked as the twelfth-largest [[non-profit]] organization in the US, with total revenues of $771 million. 

The American Institute of Philanthropy lists the Chief Scout Executive as having the fourth-highest compensation of any nonprofit chief in the United States, at a total of $913,022.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.charitywatch.org/criteria.html#top20 | title =Top 25 compensation packages | format = | work =American Institute of Philanthropy | publisher = | accessdate =2006-02-09}}</ref>   The Chief Scout Executive's pay is 0.26% of total expenses, whereas the national average among charities stands at a higher 0.34%.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm/bay/content.view/catid/68/cpid/304.htm
 | title =CEO compensation | format = | work =Charity Navigator | publisher = | accessdate =2006-02-06}}</ref> 
The Chief Scout Executive was honored in August 2005 as one of the top fifty most effective non-profit leaders by [[Non-Profit Times]].  

By comparison, the Chief Executive Officer of the similar [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] earns 0.39% of total expenses.

===National Scouting Museum===
The National Scouting Museum was founded in 1959 in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]]. In 1986, it was moved to [[Murray State University]] in [[Murray, Kentucky]]  and moved to its present location in [[Irving, Texas]] in 2002.  The museum floor is 53,000&nbsp;ft² (5000&nbsp;m²) and is a modern facility, featuring several [[Norman Rockwell]] paintings, [[High Adventure]] sections, hands-on learning experiences, interactive exhibits, and a historical collection tracing uniforms, themes, and documents from the beginning of the American Scouting movement. Among the museum's artifacts are the Eagle Scout  medal of [[Arthur Rose Eldred]], the first [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]].

==Good Turns==
In 1912, Scouts began the first of a series of Good Turns that included the promotion of a safe and sane Fourth of July.  During the 50th anniversary of the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], Scouts provided service to the veterans.  Scouts rendered aid during the 1921 floods in [[Pueblo, Colorado]] and [[San Antonio, Texas]].  President Roosevelt delivered a radio address in 1934 appealing for assistance for the distressed and needy: Scouts responded by collecting almost two millions items of clothing, household furnishings, foodstuffs, and supplies.

The National Conservation Good Turn in 1954 saw Scouts distribute 3.6 million conservation posters, 6.2 million trees, build and place 55,000 bird-nesting boxes, and arrange 41,000 conservation displays.  During the height of the [[Cold War]] in 1958, the BSA delivered 40 million Civil Defense emergency handbooks and distributed 50,000 posters.

1986 saw the Donor Awareness Good Turn: 600,000 youth members distributed 14 million brochures to families, informing them of the needs for organ donations.  In 1997, the [[President of the United States]] called for an increase in volunteer service in the US.  The BSA developed the Service to America program with a commitment to provide 200 million hours of service by youth members by the end of the year 2000.  As part of Service to America, the BSA provided service projects in conjunction with the [[National Park Service]] (NPS).  In October 2003, the [[Department of the Interior]] expanded the program with the creation of the Take Pride in America program, opening service to all Americans.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.takepride.gov/index.cfm | title =Take Pride in America | format = | work = | publisher =Department of the Interior | accessdate =2006-03-30}}</ref>

The BSA developed Good Turn for America in 2004 as a program to address the problems of hunger, homelessness and inadequate housing and poor health in conjunction with the [[Salvation Army]], the [[American Red Cross]], and [[Habitat for Humanity]].<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.goodturnforamerica.org/ | title =Good Turn for America | format = | work = | publisher =Boy Scouts of America | accessdate =2006-03-30}}</ref>

==Advancement and recognition==
{{main|Advancement and recognition in the Boy Scouts of America}}

Cub Scouting provides advancement opportunities throughout the program to help each Scout feel that he has accomplished something when completing an activity. Many advancements in Cub Scouting are of the "Immediate Recognition" type; that is they are designed to be given as soon as possible after the award is earned. Others are to be given ceremoniously at Pack meetings in front of all the Scouts in the unit and their parents. At the age of 10&nbsp;½ to 11, Cub Scouts can receive the [[Arrow of Light]], which prepares them to join Boy Scouts.

The Boy Scouting advancement system consists of a series of obstacles and the steps that boys must take to overcome them. The system is designed so that a Scout will plan his advancement; and by participating in the troop program, be recognized as he overcomes each challenge. The Scout is rewarded at each step of the way, which is intended to develop self-confidence. The steps in the advancement system are designed to help him grow in self-reliance and the ability to help others.  The highest level of Boy Scout advancement is the rank of Eagle Scout; an award considered by some to be so prestigious that many adults continue to list it as a major accomplishment or award on their resumes or CVs, many decades after they were initially awarded the badge.  Indeed, the rank of Eagle Scout is generally spoken of in the present tense, and it is not unusual, at Scout gatherings, to hear men in their 40s, 50s, 60s or even 70s, proudly proclaim: "I'm an Eagle Scout!"

==Uniform and insignia==
{{main|Uniform and insignia of the Boy Scouts of America}}
The '''Uniform and insignia of the Boy Scouts of America''' (BSA) gives a [[Scouting|Scout]] visibility and creates a level of identity within both the unit and the community.  The uniform is used to promote equality while showing individual achievement.  While all uniforms are similar in basic design, they do vary in color and detail to identify the different divisions of [[Cub Scouts (Boy Scouts of America)|Cub Scouts]], [[Boy Scouts (Boy Scouts of America)|Boy Scouts]] and [[Venturing (Boy Scouts of America)|Venturers]].

While original uniforms were very similar to military uniforms of the time, they slowly began to evolve into a more civilian attire.  In 1980, the current uniforms were introduced, with much of the design by [[Oscar de la Renta]], who donated his time for two years.<ref>{{cite web | author=Peterson, Robert| year=2002 | title=From Doughboy Duds to Oscar de la Renta | work=Scouting Magazine | url=http://www.scoutingmagazine.org/issues/0210/d-wwas.html | publisher = Boy Scouts of America | accessdate=12 January | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

The uniform and insignia are variously protected by copyright, trademark, and congressional charter.<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode2|36|30905|Exclusive right to emblems, badges, marks, and words}}</ref>   The BSA does allow usage for movies and other events, but this is done on a case by case basis.

The wear of camouflage or military style apparel as part at the uniform is also prohibited.<ref>{{cite web | author = Walton, Mike | year = 2001 | url = http://www.mninter.net/~blkeagle/camo.htm | title =  Camouflage/Military Uniforms and Scouting | format =  | work = The Badge and Uniform Site | publisher = Walton, Mike | accessdate = 7 February | accessyear = 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author =  | year = October 2005 | url = http://www.scoutingmagazine.org/issues/0510/d-lett.html | title = No 'camouflage' uniforms | format =  | work = Scouting Magazine | publisher = Boy Scouts of America | accessdate = 7 February | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>  Wear of the uniform and insignia is described in the various handbooks and the Insignia Guide.<ref>{{cite book | title = Insignia Guide 2005 | year = 2004 | publisher = Boy Scouts of America}}</ref>

==Impact on American life==
Scouting and Boy Scouts are well known throughout [[United States|American]] [[Scouting in popular culture|culture]].  Eleven of the twelve men to walk on the [[Moon]] were Scouts.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.scouting.org/factsheets/02-558.html | title =Astronauts and the BSA | format = | work = | publisher =Boy Scouts of America | accessdate =2006-10-09}}</ref> The "[[Pinewood Derby]]," for half a century "a celebrated rite of spring," has been named part of "America's 100 Best" by ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.rd.com/content/openContent.do?contentId=26667 | title =America's 100 Best: The 2006 List | format = | work = | publisher =Reader's Digest | accessdate=2006-10-10}}</ref> President [[Gerald Ford]] said, "I can say without hesitation, because of Scouting principles, I know I was a better athlete, I was a better naval officer, I was a better Congressman, and I was a better prepared President."<ref>{{cite web | last =Rumsfeld | first =Donald R | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.defenselink.mil/speeches/2006/sp20060526-13138.html | title =Speech: Boy Scout National Meeting Breakfast As Delivered by Secretary of Defense <nowiki>[</nowiki>and Eagle Scout<nowiki>]</nowiki> [[Donald Rumsfeld|Donald H.

==Other United States Scout organizations== 
Other Scout organizations in the United States include:
* ''Związek Harcerstwa Polskiego'' (ZHP) is a Scout organization of Polish emigrés, not connected with the Polish organization of the same name (see [[ZHP]]), and not aligned to a supranational organization.
* The BSA had a [[Rover Scout]]ing program for many years, but the Rovers are now virtually defunct.
* The [[Royal Rangers]] are an explicitly [[Christian]] organization operated by the [[Assemblies of God]].

==Membership controversy==
{{main|Boy Scouts of America membership controversies}}
<!---This text is a SUMMARY of the MAIN points of the issues, and is a COPY of the lead-in to the main article.  Edits made to this section will be LOST when the main article lead-in is re-synched to this section.  --->
The Boy Scouts of America (BSA), the largest [[youth organization]] in the [[United States]], has [[policies]] which prohibit or restrict certain people from membership and participation. Some of these membership policies are controversial and have resulted in the dismissal of Scouts and adult Scout leaders from the BSA or a Scouting unit for being an [[atheist]], [[agnostic]], or [[homosexuality|homosexual]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inclusivescouting.org:8000/bsa/cases/|work=Inclusive Scouting .NET|title=Case Studies|accessdate=2006-08-31}}</ref> 

The Boy Scouts of America and its supporters contend that these policies are essential in its mission to "to prepare young people to make ethical and moral choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and Law".<ref name="core">{{cite web|url=http://www.bsalegal.org/core-values-286.asp|work=BSA Legal|title=Core Values|accessdate=2006-10-02}}</ref><ref name="duty">{{cite web| url=http://www.bsalegal.org/dutytogo-155.htm|work= BSA Legal Issues |title=Duty to God |accessdate=2006-10-22}}</ref>  Critics believe that some or all of these  policies are [[wrong]] and [[Discrimination|discriminatory]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atheism.about.com/b/a/258300.htm|title=Boy Scouts & Public Funding: Defending Bigotry as a Public Good|accessdate=2006-11-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsa-discrimination.org/|work=BSA Discrimination|title=Discrimination in the BSA|accessdate=2006-09-04}}</ref>
