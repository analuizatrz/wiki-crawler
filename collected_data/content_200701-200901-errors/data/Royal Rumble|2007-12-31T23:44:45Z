The '''Royal Rumble''' is an annual [[professional wrestling]] [[pay-per-view]] event, produced every January by [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE).<ref name=wwematch>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/specialtymatches/royalrumble|title=Specialty Matches: Royal Rumble|publisher=WWE.com|accessdate=2007-12-03}}</ref> The event's main featured match is a [[battle royal (professional wrestling)|Battle Royal]]-type match,<ref name=stats>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2005/02/01/917194.html|title=Statistical survival - breaking down the Royal Rumble|author=Jon Waldman|publisher=SLAM!

Wrestling|accessdate=2007-12-09|date=January 30, 2006}}</ref>

The Rumble was originally aired on the [[USA Network]] before it was rebranded as a pay-per-view.<ref name=RF161/><ref name=pwh/> The rules and format of the Rumble match have changed since the match's debut.<ref name=pat/> Now, the winner of the Rumble match receives a title match at that year's [[WrestleMania]].<ref name=mysterio/>

==Pay-per-view==
The Royal Rumble is a [[pay-per-view]] consisting of the Royal Rumble match, championship matches, and various other matches. The first Royal Rumble took place on [[January 24]] [[1988]] and was broadcast live on the [[USA Network]].<ref name=RF161/> The following year, the event was rebranded as a pay-per-view.<ref name=pwh>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/rumble.html#89|title=Royal Rumble results|publisher=ProWrestlingHistory.com|accessdate=2007-12-05}}</ref> It is part of WWE's "classic five" pay-per-views, along with [[WrestleMania]], [[Survivor Series]], [[SummerSlam]], and [[King of the Ring]].<ref name=Main166/>

The Royal Rumble match is usually situated at the top of the [[List of professional wrestling slang#C|card]].<ref name=guard>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/PPVReports/2007/01/28/3473071.html|title=Old guard dominates Rumble|author=Dale Plummer and Nick Tylwalk|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=2007-12-09|date=January 29, 2007}}</ref> This, however, is not always the case, as the [[Royal Rumble (2006)|2006 event]] had the match in the middle of the pay-per-view.<ref name=guard/>

The first Rumble match featured only twenty men,<ref name=RR88/> and it was called the Rumble Royale.<ref name=RF161/> It lasted approximately thirty-three minutes of the two-hour broadcast.<ref name=facts>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/facts/|title=Royal Rumble: Facts & Figures|publisher=WWE.com|accessdate=2007-12-30}}</ref> The modern Rumble matches are much longer, with the longest match, at the [[Royal Rumble (2002)|2002 event]], lasting over one hour and nine minutes of an approximately three-hour pay-per-view.<ref name=facts/>

The [[Royal Rumble (2008)|2008 Royal Rumble]] will be the first WWE pay-per-view to be available in [[high-definition]] and will cost $10 more than a standard-definition pay-per-view.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.engadgethd.com/2007/12/28/royal-rumble-to-be-wwes-first-hd-pay-per-view-event/|title=Royal Rumble to be WWE's first HD pay-per-view event?|author=Darren Murph|publisher=engadgethd.com|accessdate=2007-12-31|date=December 28, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://directv.com/DTVAPP/packProg/highlights.jsp?assetId=1100103|title=Events this month|publisher=directv.com|accessdate=2007-12-31|date=December 2007}}</ref>

==Match==
[[Image:Austinentrance.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] has won three Royal Rumble matches, which is also the current record for most wins.<ref name=facts/>]]
===Rules===
The idea behind the Royal Rumble match is credited to [[Pat Patterson]].<ref name=pat>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/patpatterson/bio/|title=Hall of Fame: Pat Patterson|accessdate=2007-12-03|publisher=WWE.com}}</ref> Before the match begins, the contestants draw spots in the Rumble.<ref name=wwematch/> The match is comprised of 30 men, beginning with the two men who chose entry numbers one and two in the ring.<ref name=wwematch/> At regular timed intervals, usually two minutes, one of the remaining 28 wrestlers enters the ring.<ref name=wwematch/> Participants must eliminate all other opponents, and the winner of the event is the last wrestler remaining after all others have been eliminated.<ref name=wwematch/><ref name=mysterio/>

Similar to a [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|Battle Royal]], a wrestler is eliminated when leaving the ring over the top rope, with both feet touching the floor.<ref name=wwematch/><ref name=stats/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/specialtymatches/battleroyal|title=Specialty Matches: Battle Royal|publisher=WWE.com|accessdate=2007-12-03}}</ref> A referee, who is situated at ringside, must witness an elimination in order for it to be valid.<ref name=RR97>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/1988114111/mainevent/|title=Royal Rumble 1997: Main Event|publisher=WWE.com|accessdate=2007-12-03|quote=Stone Cold was actually eliminated during the match, but the referees failed to detect it, so he sneaked back in.}}</ref> It is commonplace for a wrestler who is eliminated without the referee noticing to sneak back into the match. For example, [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] was eliminated during the [[Royal Rumble (1997)|1997 event]], but he re-entered without the referees' knowledge and eventually won the match.<ref name=RR97/> Moreover, a wrestler who exits the ring without going over the top rope is not eliminated from the contest. During the [[Royal Rumble (1998)|1998 Rumble match]], both [[Vince McMahon]] and Steve Austin left the ring, only to return later in the match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/19881143/mainevent/|title=Royal Rumble 1999: Main Event|publisher=WWE.com|accessdate=2007-12-30}}</ref>

===Rewards for winning===
The reward for the [[Royal Rumble (1992)|1992 Royal Rumble]] was the [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]].<ref name=RR92/> The tradition of granting a [[WWE Championship]] match at [[WrestleMania]] started in 1993.<ref name=about>{{cite web|url=http://prowrestling.about.com/od/thewrestlers/a/rumblewinnerfat.htm|title=The Fate of the Royal Rumble Winner|author=Eric Cohen|publisher=About.com|accessdate=2007-12-09|date=April 25, 2007}}</ref> Beginning in 2004, the winner had their choice of a [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] or WWE Championship match at WrestleMania.<ref name=about/> Due to the revival of the [[ECW Championship|ECW World Championship]] as a brand championship in mid-2006, the 2007 event added this championship as a choice to the winning stipulation.<ref name=ecwtitle>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/02052007/|title=Tickets punched for WrestleMania|author=Brett Hoffman|publisher=WWE.com|accessdate=2007-12-05|date=February 5, 2007}}</ref> The Rumble winner has gone on to win a Championship title at WrestleMania every year since [[WrestleMania X-Seven]] in 2001.<ref name=facts/>

===Brand extension===
With the [[WWE Brand Extension|brand extension]] introduced in mid-2002, the 30 entrants from 2003 to 2006 consisted of 15 wrestlers from both the [[WWE Raw|RAW]] and [[WWE Friday Night SmackDown!|SmackDown!]] brands. At first, the winner of the match received a shot at his brand's champion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/PPVReports/2004/01/26/325195.html|title=Benoit wins the 'Rumble'|author=John Powell|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=2007-12-23|date=January 26, 2004}}</ref> Starting in 2004, the Rumble winner had the option of challenging either brand's champion.<ref name=about/> For instance, [[Chris Benoit]] switched brands in 2004 and won the World Heavyweight Championship.<ref name=about/> The 2007 Royal Rumble marked the first year participants from the [[Extreme Championship Wrestling (WWE)|ECW]] brand competed along with the RAW and SmackDown! brands.<ref name=RR07>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/matches/35535102/results/|title=A Phenom-enal Rumble|author=Louie Dee|publisher=WWE.com|accessdate=2007-12-05|date=January 28, 2007}}</ref> The winner of the Royal Rumble now has the option to challenge for the [[ECW Championship|ECW World Championship]], as well.<ref name=ecwtitle/>
