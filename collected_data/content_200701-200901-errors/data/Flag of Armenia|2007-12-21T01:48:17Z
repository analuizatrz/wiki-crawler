The national '''[[flag]] of [[Armenia]]''', the '''Armenian [[Tricolour]]''', consists of three horizontal bands of equal width, [[red]] on the top, [[blue]] in the middle, and [[orange (colour)|orange]] on the bottom. The Armenian Supreme Council adopted the current flag on [[August 24]], [[1990]]. On [[June 15]], [[2006]], the Law on the National Flag of Armenia was passed by the [[National Assembly of Armenia|Armenian Parliament]]. 

Throughout history, there were many variations of the Armenian flag. In ancient times, Armenian dynasties were represented by different symbolic animals displayed on their flags.<ref name="evolution">{{cite web |url=http://www.armenianheritage.com/hiflag.htm |title=The Evolution of the Armenian Flag |accessdate=2007-01-05 |work=Armenianheritage.com}}</ref> In the twentieth century, various Soviet flags represented the Armenian nation.

==Symbolism==
The meanings of the colors have been interpreted in many different ways. However, many agree that red stands for the blood shed by Armenian soldiers in war, blue stands for the Armenian sky, and orange represents the fertile lands of Armenia and the workers who work them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vexilla-mundi.com/armenia.htm |title=Armenia |accessdate=2007-01-06 |work=Vexilla Mundi}}</ref>

The official meaning of the colors, as stated in the Constitution of the Republic of Armenia, is:
{{cquote|Red symbolizes the Armenian Highland, the Armenian people's continued struggle for survival, maintenance of the [[Christianity|Christian faith]], Armenia's independence and freedom. Blue symbolizes the will of the people of Armenia to live beneath peaceful skies. Orange symbolizes the creative talent and hard-working nature of the people of Armenia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.am/enversion/armenia/flag.htm |title=The flag of the Republic of Armenia |accessdate=2007-01-06 |work=Government of Republic of Armenia}}</ref>}}

==Design==
Since the Armenian government does not specify the exact shades of red, blue, and orange, two different versions of the flag are in common use. The more common version consists of brighter shades, whereas the colors of the less common version are more faded. The following table gives the approximate [[RGB]] values of the colors used in those two versions:<ref>The Jasc Paint Shop Pro program was used to collect the RGB values for the listed flags.</ref>

==History==
{{see|List of Armenian flags}}
[[Image:Artaxiad standard.gif|thumb|200px|right|Artaxiad Dynasty 189 BC - 1 AD]]
There is no resemblance between the earliest Armenian flag of antiquity and today's tricolor. The ancient flags displayed a dragon, an eagle, or some mysterious object of the gods (sometimes a lion). The flags were fastened to the end of a pole and led the armies into battle.  With the advent of Christianity, the Armenian empire adopted many different flags representing various dynasties. The [[Artaxiad Dynasty]]'s flag, for instance, consisted of a red cloth displaying two eagles gazing at each other, separated by a flower.

===19th century===
[[Image:1885ArmenianFlag.svg|thumb|200px|right|[[Image:FIAV_historical.png]] Alishan's 1885 design.  Flag Ratio: 1:2]]
After Armenia was split between the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] and [[Ottoman Empire]]s, the idea of an Armenian flag ceased to exist for some time. Nevertheless, the issue was revived in 1885 when the [[Armenian Students Association of Paris]] wanted to join the funeral of [[Victor Hugo]] with a national flag and appealed to an [[Armenian Catholic Church|Armenian Catholic]] priest, Father [[Ghevont Alishan]] to design one for them. Alishan's first design was very similar to today's modern Armenian flag: a horizontal tricolor. However, it looks more like an upside-down variation of the current [[flag of Bulgaria]]. The top band was red, symbolizing the first Sunday of Easter (called "Red" Sunday), followed by a green band to represent the "Green" Sunday of Easter, and finally an arbitrary color, white, was chosen to complete the combination.<ref name="evolution" /> While in France, Alishan also designed a second flag, identified today as the "Nationalist Armenian Flag." It too was a tricolor, but unlike the previous design, this one was a vertical tricolor similar to the [[Flag of France|French flag]]. Its colors were red, green, and blue, from left to right, representing the band of colors that [[Noah]] saw after landing on [[Mount Ararat]].

===Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic===
[[Image:Flag of the Transcaucasian Federation.svg|thumb|200px|right|[[Image:FIAV_historical.png]] Flag of Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic (1918).  Flag Ratio: 1:2]]
In 1828, [[Persian Armenia]] was annexed to the [[Russian Empire]] after the last [[Russo-Persian War (1826-1828)|Russo-Persian War]], and became known as [[Russian Armenia]]. When the Russian Empire collapsed, Russian Armenia declared its independence and joined the short-lived [[Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic]], together with [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]]. This unified state hardly lasted a year and was soon dissolved. Since the Republic was short-lived, it did not use any flags or symbols. Nevertheless, some historians consider a horizontal gold, black, and red tricolor, similar to that of the [[Flag of Germany|German flag]] but arranged differently, to have been flag of Transcaucasia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hrono.rspu.ryazan.ru/heraldicum/flagi/gruzia/federat.htm |title=Закавказская Федерация (Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic) |accessdate=2006-12-27 |date=2003-05-30 |publisher=Russian Centre of Vexillology and Heraldry |language=[[Russian language|Russian]]}}</ref> The federation was dissolved on [[May 26]], [[1918]], when Georgia declared its independence as the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]]. Both Armenia and Azerbaijan declared their independence two days later, on [[May 28]], [[1918]], as the [[Democratic Republic of Armenia]] (DRA) and the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] (ADR), respectively.

===Democratic Republic of Armenia===
[[Image:Flag of the Democratic Republic of Armenia.svg|thumb|200px|right|[[Image:FIAV_historical.png]]  Flag of Democratic Republic of Armenia (DRA) 1918–1922. Flag Ratio: 2:3]]
Upon independence, the Democratic Republic of Armenia adopted the modern Armenian tricolor. Upon [[Stepan Malkhasyan]]'s appearance in the Armenian National Council,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hrono.rspu.ryazan.ru/heraldicum/flagi/armenia/ar.htm |title=Республика Армения(Democratic Republic of Armenia) |accessdate=2006-01-09 |date=2003-03-28 |publisher=Russian Centre of Vexillology and Heraldry |language=[[Russian language|Russian]]}}</ref> the independent Armenian government selected the colors of the last period of the [[Rubenid|Rubenid Dynasty]]: red, blue, and yellow, in which yellow was immediately replaced by orange, because it merged better with the other colors and presented a more pleasing composition. The flag of independent Armenia then had a ratio of 2:3, but on [[August 24]], [[1990]], when the Armenian Supreme Council adopted it as the flag of the Republic of Armenia, the ratio was changed to 1:2.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/am_.html#1918 |title=Armenia: First Republic (1918–1921) |accessdate=2007-01-09 |work=Flags of the World}}</ref>

===Early Soviet Armenia and the Transcaucasian SFSR===
[[Image:Flag of Transcaucasian SFSR.svg|thumb|200px|right|
[[Image:FIAV_historical.png]] Flag of Transcaucasian SFSR 1922–1936.]]
{{main|Flag of the Transcaucasian SFSR}}
On [[November 29]] [[1920]] [[Bolshevik]]s established the [[Armenian SSR]]. A new flag was introduced and fixed in the constitution, accepted on [[February 2]] [[1922]] by the First [[Congress of Soviets]] of the Armenian SSR.<ref name="ArmSSR">{{cite web |url=http://www.hrono.ru/heraldicum/flagi/armenia/assr.htm |title=Cоветская Армения (Soviet Armenia) |accessdate=2007-01-20|date=2004-11-14 |publisher=Russian Centre of Vexillology and Heraldry |language=[[Russian language|Russian]]}}</ref> That flag existed only for a month, because on [[March 12]] the Armenian SSR united with the [[Georgian SSR]] and the [[Azerbaijan SSR]] under the [[Transcaucasian SFSR]] (TSFSR). On [[December 30]] [[1922]] the Transcaucasian SFSR became one of the four Soviet republics, that united to form the [[USSR]]. The flag of the republic had a [[hammer and sickle]] inserted into a star with initials "Z-S-F-S-R" written in Russian sans-serif script. These letters stand for "Zakavkazskaya Sovetskaya Federativnaya Socialisticheskaya Respublika" or "Transcaucasian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic".<ref name="ArmSSR"/> In 1936, the TSFSR was broken up into its three constituent regions, which were named the Georgian SSR, the Armenian SSR, and the Azerbaijan SSR.

===Armenian SSR===
[[Image:Flag of Armenian SSR.svg|thumb|200px|right|[[Image:FIAV_historical.png]] Flag of Soviet Armenia 1952–1991. Flag Ratio: 1:2]]
{{main|Flag of the Armenian SSR}}
As a [[Republics of the Soviet Union|republic of the USSR]], the Armenian SSR  introduced its first flag in 1936. Very much alike the [[flag of the Soviet Union]], it was red and featured a yellow [[hammer and sickle]] in the corner. Underneath that, there were "H-Kh-S-H" initials  written in Armenian serif script. These initials, in the [[Western Armenian language|Western Armenian]] language, stand for "''Haygagan Khorhurtayin Sodzialistakan Hanrabedutyun''," or the "Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic."  In the 1940s, the flag was altered to use the [[Eastern Armenian language|Eastern Armenian]] language spoken in the Republic. The initials were changed to "H-S-S-R" meaning "Hayastani Sovetakan Sotsialistikakan Respublika" in the Eastern Armenian pronunciation. In 1952, a new flag was introduced. The initials were removed completely and in their place a horizontal blue stripe was added. This flag remained unaltered until 1991, when Armenia gained its independence from the [[Soviet Union]], and the pre-Soviet tricolor was immediately restored. The tricolor had been used previously by Armenian national movements in 1990, after Armenia first declared its independence.

==Usage==
[[Image:ArmenianEmbassyWashingtonDC01.jpg|150px|thumb|The flag waving at the Armenian Embassy in Washington, D.C.]]

==Flag's influence==
[[Image:Flag of Nagorno-Karabakh.svg|thumb|200px|right|[[Image:FIAV_defacto.png]] Flag of Nagorno-Karabakh. Flag Ratio: 1:2]]
On [[June 2]], [[1992]], the self-proclaimed [[Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh]] adopted a [[Flag of Nagorno-Karabakh|flag]] based on the Armenian tricolor: red, blue, and orange. A white, five-toothed, stepped carpet pattern was added to the flag, beginning at the two verges of the cloth’s right side and connecting at a point equal to one-third of the distance from that side.<ref name="nkr">{{cite web |url=http://www.nkr.am/eng/gov/atributy.html |title=Attributes of Statehood |accessdate=2007-01-09 |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Nagorno-Karabakh}}</ref> The white pattern symbolizes the  current separation of [[Artsakh]] (Nagorno-Karabakh) from Armenia proper and its aspiration for eventual union with "the Motherland."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/az-artsa.html |title=Flag of Artsakh / Nagorno-Karabakh |accessdate=2007-01-09 |publisher=Flags of the World}}</ref> The ratio of the flag’s breadth to its length is 1:2, same as the Armenian Tricolor.<ref name="nkr" />

In addition to the flag of Nagorno-Karabakh, the Armenian flag colors influenced the design of the Pan-Armenian Games flag. In the center of the light blue flag are six interlocking rings, derived from the [[Olympic rings]]. The sixth, orange-colored ring, interlocks with the blue and red rings, which symbolize Armenia. Above the rings is a flame in the colors of the Armenian flag.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/am@.html |title=Armenia: Sport flags |accessdate=2007-01-09 |publisher=Flags of the World}}</ref>

The national flag is also mentioned in the song [[Mer Hayrenik]], the [[national anthem]] of Armenia. Specifically, the second and third stanzas sing about the creation of the national flag:

:Here brother, for you a flag,
:That I made with my hands
:Nights I didn't sleep,
:With tears I washed it.
:''(repeat previous two lines)''

:Look at it, three colors
:It's our gifted symbol.
:Let it shine against the enemy.
:Let Armenia always be glorious.
:''(repeat previous two lines)''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalanthems.info/am'.htm |title=Lyrics of Mer Hayrenik |accessdate=2007-01-10 |publisher=National Anthems.net}}</ref>
