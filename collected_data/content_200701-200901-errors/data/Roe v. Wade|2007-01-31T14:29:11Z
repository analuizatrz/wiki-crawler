The 1973 case of '''''Roe v. Wade''''' resulted in a [[landmark decision|landmark]] judicial opinion regarding [[privacy]] and [[abortion in the United States]].<ref name="Roe">''Roe v. Wade'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&court=US&vol=410&page=113 410 U.S. 113] (1973). Findlaw.com.  Retrieved [[2007-01-26]]</ref>  According to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court's]] ''Roe'' decision, most laws against [[abortion]] violated a [[United States Constitution|constitutional right]] to privacy under the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].  The decision overturned all [[U.S. state|state]] and [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] laws outlawing or restricting abortion that were inconsistent with its holdings. ''Roe'' is one of the most controversial and politically significant cases in U.S. Supreme Court history, and its lesser-known companion case was decided at the same time in 1973: ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]''.<ref name="Doe">''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=410&invol=179 410 U.S. 179] (1973). Findlaw.com.  Retrieved [[2007-01-26]]</ref>

The central holding of ''Roe v. Wade'' was that abortions are permissible for any reason a woman chooses, up until the "point at which the [[fetus]] becomes ‘viable,’ that is, potentially able to live outside the mother's womb, albeit with artificial aid. [[Viability]] is usually placed at about seven months (28 weeks) but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks."<ref name="Roe"/>  The decision prompted national debate that continues to this day over whether a state can choose to deem the act of terminating a pregnancy ''illegal'', the role of the Supreme Court in constitutional adjudication, and the role of [[religion|religious]] and [[morality|moral]] views in the political sphere. ''Roe v. Wade'' reshaped national politics, dividing much of the nation into "[[pro-choice]]" and "[[pro-life]]" camps, and inspiring [[grassroots]] activism on both sides.

Critics describe ''Roe'' as illegitimate for straying from the text and history of the Constitution, and for imposing abortion policy on the states and Congress contrarily to American principles of [[federalism]] and [[democracy]].  Some critics of ''Roe'' also believe in the [[personhood]] of fetal [[human]] life, either beginning at conception or later.  Supporters describe ''Roe'' as vital to preservation of [[Equalism|women's equality]], personal freedom, privacy, and the primacy of individual rights, although the opposition to ''Roe'' often references the primacy of the individual when referring to the fetus.

==History of case==

The case originated in Texas in March 1970 at the behest of attorneys [[Linda Coffee]] and [[Sarah Weddington]]. They  filed suit on behalf of [[Norma McCorvey|Norma L. McCorvey]] ("[[John Doe|Jane Roe]]") who claimed her pregnancy was the result of rape, although McCorvey now says that the rape claim was false.<ref name="testimony"/>  The defendant in the case was [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas County]] district attorney [[Henry Wade]], representing the State of Texas.

A three-judge district court ruled in favor of "Jane Roe", but refused to grant an injunction against the enforcement of the laws.<ref>''Roe v. Wade'', [http://www.answers.com/topic/roe-v-wade-3#Roe_vol1_315-323 314 F. Supp. 1217] (1970).  Answers.com.  Retrieved [[2007-01-27]]</ref>  The district court's decision was based upon the [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]], and relied upon a concurring opinion by Justice [[Arthur Goldberg]] in the 1965 Supreme Court case of ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' that had discovered a constitutional right to use contraceptives.  Not many state laws were overturned by the ''Griswold'' case in 1965, but in 1973 abortion was widely [[proscription|proscribed]] by state laws.<ref>Karen O'Connor, Professor of Government, American University, testimony before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, "[http://judiciary.senate.gov/testimony.cfm?id=1553&wit_id=4399 The Consequences of Roe v.

Both "Jane Roe" and defendant Wade arrived at the Supreme Court on appeal, where the case was argued by Weddington and Texas Assistant Attorney General Jay Floyd on [[December 13]], [[1971]]. Following that first round of arguments, Justice Blackmun drafted a preliminary opinion that emphasized what he saw as the Texas law's vagueness.<ref>See Bernard Schwartz, ''[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0195053176&id=gUMrsFFZtrQC&pg=PA103&lpg=PA103&ots=QNkrOUc9-w&dq=%22under+constitutional+attack+here+are+abortion+laws+of+the+state+of+texas%22&num=100&sig=5RHH8d8rM4Jae98JFRUSiaoelyw The Unpublished Opinions of the Burger Court]'', page 103 (1988 Oxford University Press), via Google Books.

==Supreme Court decision==	
[[image: Blackmun.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Harry Blackmun]] wrote the Court’s opinion.]]  The court issued its decision on [[January 22]], [[1973]], with a 7 to 2 majority voting to strike down Texas' abortion laws.  However, the concurring opinions of Chief Justice Burger and Justice Douglas, and the dissenting opinion of Justice White, were issued separately, in the companion case of ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]''.

===Abortion===
The ''Roe'' Court deemed abortion a [[fundamental right]] under the [[United States Constitution]], thereby subjecting all laws attempting to restrict it to the standard of [[strict scrutiny]]. Though abortion technically remains to this day a fundamental right, subsequent cases, notably ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey|Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey]]'' and ''[[Stenberg v. Carhart]]'', have modified the legal standard somewhat.

The opinion of the ''Roe'' Court, written by Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], declined to adopt the district court's [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]] rationale, and instead asserted that the "right of privacy, whether it be founded in the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or, as the District Court determined, in the Ninth Amendment's reservation of rights to the people, is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy."  Justice Douglas, in his concurring opinion in the companion case of ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'', stated even more emphatically that, "The Ninth Amendment obviously does not create federally enforceable rights."  Thus, the ''Roe'' majority rested its opinion squarely on the Constitution's [[Due Process Clause]].

According to the ''Roe'' Court, "the restrictive criminal abortion laws in effect in a majority of States today are of relatively recent vintage." [[Abortion_in_the_United_States#Abortion_before_Roe|Abortion before ''Roe'']] had been subject to criminal statutes since at least the nineteenth century.  Section VI of Blackmun's opinion was devoted to an analysis of historical attitudes, including those of: the [[Persia|Persian Empire]], [[Ancient Greece|Greek times]], the [[Roman era]], the [[Hippocratic oath]], the [[common law]], English [[statutory law]], American law, the [[American Medical Association]], the [[American Public Health Association]], and the [[American Bar Association]].

Without finding what it deemed a sufficient historical basis to justify the Texas statute, the Court identified three possible justifications in Section VII of the opinion to explain the criminalization of abortion: (1) women who can receive an abortion are more likely to engage in "illicit sexual conduct", (2) the medical procedure was extremely risky prior to the development of antibiotics and, even with modern medical techniques, is still risky in late stages of pregnancy, and lastly (3) the state has an interest in protecting prenatal life. As to the first, Blackmun wrote that "no court or commentator has taken the argument seriously" and the statute failed to "distinguish between married and unwed mothers." However, according to the Court, the second and third constitute valid state interests. In Section X, the Court reiterated, "[T]he State does have an important and legitimate interest in preserving and protecting the health of the pregnant woman ... and that it has still another important and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life."

Valid state interests, however, must be weighed against the constitutionally protected rights of individuals in order to determine whether a law is a constitutional exercise of power. Even though the "Constitution does not explicitly mention any right of privacy" the court had previously found support for various privacy rights in several provisions of the [[Bill of Rights]] and the [[Fourteenth Amendment]], as well as in the "[[penumbra]]" of the Bill of Rights. Instead of relying upon the Bill of Rights or "penumbras, formed by emanations" as the Court had done in ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'', the ''Roe'' Court instead decided to rely upon a "right of privacy" that it said was located in the [[Due Process Clause]] of the Constitution.

However, the Court determined that "arguments that Texas either has no valid interest at all in regulating the abortion decision, or no interest strong enough to support any limitation upon the woman's sole determination, are unpersuasive." The Court declared, "We, therefore, conclude that the right of personal privacy includes the abortion decision, but that this right is not unqualified and must be considered against important state interests in regulation." 

When weighing the competing interests that the Court had identified, Justice Blackmun also noted that if the [[fetus]] was defined as a person for purposes of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] then the fetus would have a specific right to life under that Amendment.  However, the Court determined that the original intent of the Constitution up to the enactment of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] in [[1868]] did not include the unborn.  The Court's determination of whether a fetus can enjoy constitutional protection was separate from the notion of when life begins: "We need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins. When those trained in the respective disciplines of [[medicine]], [[philosophy]], and [[theology]] are unable to arrive at any consensus, the [[judiciary]], at this point in the development of man's knowledge, is not in a position to speculate as to the answer."  The Court only believed itself competent to resolve the difficult question of when a right to abortion begins.

The decision established a system of [[trimester]]s that attempted to balance the state's legitimate interests against the abortion right.  The Court ruled that the state cannot restrict a woman's right to an abortion during the first trimester, the state can regulate the abortion procedure during the second trimester "in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health," and in the third trimester, which demarcated the viability of the fetus, a state can choose to restrict or even to [[proscription|proscribe]] abortion as it sees fit.

===Justiciability===
An aspect of the decision that attracted comparatively little attention was the Court's disposition of the issues of [[Standing (law)|standing]] and [[mootness]]. The Supreme Court does not issue [[advisory opinion]]s (those stating what the law would be in some hypothetical circumstance). Instead, there must be an actual "[[case or controversy]]", including particularly a plaintiff who is aggrieved and seeks relief. In the ''Roe'' case, "Jane Roe," who began the litigation in March 1970, had already given birth by the time the case was argued before the Supreme Court in December 1971. By the traditional rules, therefore, there was an argument that Roe's appeal was moot because she would not be affected by the ruling, and also because she lacked standing to assert the rights of other pregnant women. The Court concluded, however, that the case came within an established exception to the rule, one that allowed consideration of an issue that was "capable of repetition, yet evading review." This phrase had been coined in 1911 by Justice [[Joseph McKenna]].<ref>''Southern Pacific v. Interstate Commerce Commission'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=219&invol=498 219 U.S. 498] (1911).  Findlaw.com.  Retrieved [[2007-01-26]]</ref> Justice Blackmun's opinion quoted McKenna, and noted that human pregnancy would normally conclude more quickly than an appellate process. "If that termination makes a case moot, pregnancy litigation seldom will survive much beyond the trial stage, and appellate review will be effectively denied." Such a ruling was critical to the Supreme Court's power to review the case, since the Supreme Court dismissed the physician James Hubert Hallford's intervention and affirmed the dismissal of John and Mary Doe.

== Dissents ==
[[image: Justice White Official.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Byron White]] was the senior dissenting justice.]]
Associate Justices [[Byron R. White]] and [[William H. Rehnquist]] wrote emphatic dissenting opinions in this case.  Justice White wrote:

{{cquote|I find nothing in the language or history of the Constitution to support the Court's judgment.  The Court simply fashions and announces a new constitutional right for pregnant mothers and, with scarcely any reason or authority for its action, invests that right with sufficient substance to override most existing state abortion statutes. The upshot is that the people and the legislatures of the 50 States are constitutionally disentitled to weigh the relative importance of the continued existence and development of the fetus, on the one hand, against a spectrum of possible impacts on the mother, on the other hand. As an exercise of raw judicial power, the Court perhaps has authority to do what it does today; but, in my view, its judgment is an improvident and extravagant exercise of the power of judicial review that the Constitution extends to this Court.<ref name="Doe"/>}}

Justice White asserted that the Court "values the convenience of the pregnant mother more than the continued existence and development of the life or potential life that she carries." Even though Justice White suggested that he "might agree" with the Court's values and priorities, he saw "no constitutional warrant for imposing such an order of priorities on the people and legislatures of the States."  Justice White criticized the Court for involving itself in this issue by creating "a constitutional barrier to state efforts to protect human life and by investing mothers and doctors with the constitutionally protected right to exterminate it."  Justice White would have left this issue, for the most part, "with the people and to the political processes the people have devised to govern their affairs."

Justice Rehnquist elaborated upon several of Justice White's points, by asserting that the Court's historical analysis was flawed:

{{cquote|To reach its result, the Court necessarily has had to find within the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment a right that was apparently completely unknown to the drafters of the Amendment.  As early as 1821, the first state law dealing directly with abortion was enacted by the Connecticut Legislature.  By the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, there were at least 36 laws enacted by state or territorial legislatures limiting abortion. While many States have amended or updated their laws, 21 of the laws on the books in 1868 remain in effect today.<ref name="Roe"/>}} 

From this historical record, Rehnquist concluded that, "There apparently was no question concerning the validity of this provision or of any of the other state statutes when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted." Therefore, in his view, "the drafters did not intend to have the Fourteenth Amendment withdraw from the States the power to legislate with respect to this matter."

==Controversy==
Many [[pro-life]] supporters have argued that life begins upon [[fertilisation|conception]], and thus that the unborn should be entitled to legal protection. Others have argued that, in the absence of definite knowledge when life begins, it is best to not risk killing an innocent victim by allowing abortion.<ref>E.g. see Ronald Reagan, ''[http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/10456929?tab=holdings Abortion and the Conscience of the Nation]'', (Nelson 1984): "If you don't know whether a body is alive or dead, you would never bury it. I think this consideration itself should be enough for all of us to insist on protecting the unborn."  Retrieved [[2007-01-26]]</ref>  Also, [[Abortion_in_the_United_States#Public opinion|many Americans believe]] that, although some abortions should be allowed, ''Roe'' went too far. 

Many conservatives and other supporters of federalism have objected to the ''Roe'' decision as lacking a valid constitutional foundation.  Like the dissenters in ''Roe'', they have maintained that the Constitution is silent on the issue, and that proper solutions to the question would best be found via state legislatures and the democratic process, rather than through an all-encompassing ruling from the Supreme Court. Some liberals have felt justification for the result in ''Roe'' could be found in the Constitution, but not in the articles referenced in the decision.<ref>See ''[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0814799183&id=Us-277i9ZJYC&pg=PP1&lpg=PP1&ots=P3h5hDqS1u&dq=%22what+roe+v.+wade+should+have+said%22&num=100&sig=gJ9jX7_d2MOXAkvWRgkwiDYImPs What Roe v.

Pro-life protesters have frequently picketed abortion clinics, distributed literature and other forms of persuasion to women considering abortion, and have promoted adoption efforts to steer women away from abortion. Every year on the anniversary of the decision, tens of thousands of protesters demonstrate outside the Supreme Court Building in [[Washington, D.C.]] in the [[March for Life]]. 

More extreme variants of the pro-life movement have also developed; abortion doctors have been the targets of harassment and even murder by individuals who claim taking the life of an abortion doctor is actually saving the lives of many human fetuses.<ref>Dean Schabner, “[http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=96790&page=1 A Call to Arms for Christian Terrorists]”,  ABC News (Jan. 22, 2004).  Retrieved [[2007-01-26]].</ref> However, activists who advocate or practice violence against abortion providers or recipients are consistently denounced by virtually all prominent pro-life groups.  

In response to ''Roe v. Wade'', several states enacted or attempted to enact laws limiting abortion, including laws requiring parental consent for minors to obtain abortions, parental notification laws, spousal consent laws, spousal notification laws, laws requiring abortions to be performed in hospitals but not clinics, laws barring state funding for abortions, laws banning most very late term abortions utilizing [[intact dilation and extraction]] procedures (referred to as [[partial-birth abortion]] by abortion opponents), laws requiring waiting periods before abortion, laws mandating women read certain types of literature before choosing an abortion, and many more.<ref>Guttmacher Institute, "[http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_OAL.pdf State Policies in Brief, An Overview of Abortion Laws]", published [[2007-01-01]], retrieved [[2007-01-26]].</ref> Congress in 1976 passed the [[Hyde Amendment]], barring federal funding for abortion. Abortions are currently prohibited in overseas military hospitals, and the United States is barred from aiding international [[birth control|family planning]] organizations providing abortion. The Supreme Court struck down several state restrictions on abortions in a long series of cases stretching from the mid-1970s to the late 1980s, but upheld restrictions on funding, including the Hyde Amendment, in the case of ''[[Harris v. McRae]]'' (1980). 

Some academics supported the ''Roe'' decision, including Judith Jarvis Thomson, who before the decision had offered an influential defense of abortion.<ref>Judith Jarvis Thomson, "A Defense of Abortion," in ''Philosophy and Public Affairs'', vol. 1, no. 1 (1971), pp. 47–66.</ref> Several groups have also emerged dedicated to ''Roe'''s defense. Many Americans vigorously support abortion rights as necessary to women's equality and personal liberty, just as many Americans vigorously disagree. 

Most prominent among pro-choice groups is the [[National Abortion Rights Action League]], as well as [[EMILY's List]] (a pro-choice [[political action committee]]). Most prominent among pro-life groups is the [[National Right to Life Committee]].  During his lifetime, [[Harry Blackmun]], author of the ''Roe'' opinion, was a determined advocate for the decision, making speeches across the country praising ''Roe'' as essential to women's equality and reproductive freedom. During the 1980s and 1990s, pressure grew from pro-choice groups for the Democratic Party to take a unified stand in favor of ''Roe''. 

Fueled by the intensity of feelings in both its supporters and critics, the controversy over ''Roe'' shows no sign of abating. Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] has delineated the positions of two camps in this controversy: 

{{cquote|Millions of Americans believe that life begins at conception and consequently that an abortion is akin to causing the death and violating the liberty of an innocent child; they recoil at the thought of a law that would permit it. Other millions fear that a law that forbids abortion would condemn many American women to lives that lack dignity, depriving them of personal liberty and leading those with least resources to undergo illegal abortions with the attendant risks of death and suffering.<ref>''[[Stenberg v. Carhart]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&court=US&vol=530&page=914 530 U.S. 914] (2000). Findlaw.com.  Retrieved [[2007-01-26]]</ref>}}

===Internal memoranda===
Internal Supreme Court memoranda surfaced in the [[Library of Congress]] in 1988, among the personal papers of Justice Douglas and other Justices, showing the private discussions of the Justices on the case. Blackmun said of the majority decision he authored, "[Y]ou will observe that I have concluded that the end of the first trimester is critical. This is arbitrary, but perhaps any other selected point, such as quickening or viability, is equally arbitrary." Stewart said the lines were "legislative" and wanted more flexibility and consideration paid to the state legislatures, though he joined Blackmun's decision. Professor Douglas Kmiec  testified<ref>Douglas W. Kmiec, "[http://members.aol.com/abtrbng2/roememos.txt Testimony Before Subcommittee on the Constitution, Judiciary Committee, U.S. House of Representatives]" (April 22, 1996), via the "Abortion Law Homepage".  Retrieved [[2007-01-23]].</ref> about Justice Marshall's papers to this effect before the House Judiciary Committee in 1996. The assertion that the Supreme Court was making a legislative decision is often repeated by opponents of the Court's decision. The "viability" criterion, which Justice Blackmun acknowledged was arbitrary, is still in effect, although the point of viability has receded toward conception as medical science has found ways to help premature babies survive.

===Liberal legal criticisms===
Many liberal legal scholars have criticized ''Roe'', despite their opposition to anti-abortion laws.  [[William Saletan]], for example, has written that "Blackmun’s [Supreme Court] papers vindicate every indictment of ''Roe'': invention, overreach, arbitrariness, textual indifference."<ref>William Saletan, "[http://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/May-June-2005/feature_saleton_mayjun05.msp Unbecoming Justice Blackmun]", ''Legal Affairs'', May/June 2005.

Retrieved via timothypcarney.com, [[2007-01-23]].</ref> Professor [[John Hart Ely]] criticized ''Roe'' as a decision which "is not constitutional law and gives almost no sense of an obligation to try to be." Ely added: "What is frightening about ''Roe'' is that this super-protected right is not inferable from the language of the Constitution, the framers’ thinking respecting the specific problem in issue, any general value derivable from the provisions they included, or the nation’s governmental structure."

Likewise, Harvard law professor [[Laurence Tribe]] has noted that, "One of the most curious things about ''Roe'' is that, behind its own verbal smokescreen, the substantive judgment on which it rests is nowhere to be found."<ref>Laurence H.

Roe , with its reliance on trimesters and viability, has a musty feel to it, and its argument about privacy raises more questions than it answers....It seems more fiat than argument….[A] bad decision is a bad decision. If the best we can say for it is that the end justifies the means, then we have not only lost the argument — but a bit of our soul as well."  Retrieved [[2007-01-23]].</ref> has expressed a similar view.  [[Edward Lazarus]], a former Blackmun clerk who "loved Roe’s author like a grandfather" has stated as follows: "As a matter of constitutional interpretation and judicial method, ''Roe'' borders on the indefensible....Justice Blackmun’s opinion provides essentially no reasoning in support of its holding. And in the almost 30 years since ''Roe''’s announcement, no one has produced a convincing defense of ''Roe'' on its own terms."<ref>Edward Lazarus,"[http://writ.corporate.findlaw.com/lazarus/20021003.html The Lingering Problems with Roe v.

You will be hard-pressed to find a constitutional law professor, even among those who support the idea of constitutional protection for the right to choose, who will embrace the opinion itself rather than the result….This is not surprising. As constitutional argument, Roe is barely coherent. The court pulled its fundamental right to choose more or less from the constitutional ether. It supported that right via a lengthy, but purposeless, cross-cultural historical review of abortion restrictions and a tidy but irrelevant refutation of the straw-man argument that a fetus is a constitutional ‘person’ entited to the protection of the 14th Amendment....By declaring an inviolable fundamental right to abortion, Roe short-circuited the democratic deliberation that is the most reliable method of deciding questions of competing values."

==Public opinion==

An April 2006 [[Harris Interactive|Harris]] poll on ''Roe v. Wade'', asked the following question:

{{cquote|In 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that states laws which made it illegal for a woman to have an abortion up to three months of pregnancy were unconstitutional, and that the decision on whether a woman should have an abortion up to three months of pregnancy should be left to the woman and her doctor to decide. In general, do you favor or oppose this part of the U.S. Supreme Court decision making abortions up to three months of pregnancy legal?<ref>Harris Interactive, ([[2006-05-04]]). "[http://www.harrisinteractive.com/harris_poll/index.asp?PID=659 Support for Roe vs. Wade Declines to Lowest Level Ever]." Retrieved [[2007-01-04]].</ref>}}

In reply, 49% of respondents indicated favor while 47% indicated opposition, and the Harris organization has concluded from this poll that "49 percent now support Roe vs. Wade."  In fact, the poll question only dealt with first trimester abortions, and it is known that the [[Abortion in the United States#By trimester of pregnancy|legality of later abortions is more controversial]].  Pro-life groups assert that the media has often misreported polls on the issue of abortion.<ref>Press Release from National Right to Life Committee titled “[http://www.nrlc.org/abortion/Roedistort112904.html Associated Press and Other Media Distort ''Roe v. Wade'' and Public Opinion on Abortion Policy]” ([[2004]]-[[11-29]]).  Retrieved [[2007]]-[[01-12]].</ref>

==Role in subsequent decisions and politics==
Opposition to ''Roe'' on the bench grew as [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]], who supported legislative restrictions on abortion, made federal judicial appointments. However, Reagan has denied that there was any [[litmus test (politics)|litmus test]]: "I have never given a litmus test to anyone that I have appointed to the bench…. I feel very stongly about those social issues, but I also place my confidence in the fact that the one thing that I do seek are judges that will interpret the law and not write the law.  We've had too many examples in recent years of courts and judges legislating."<ref>''[http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1986/62386e.htm Interview With Eleanor Clift, Jack Nelson, and Joel Havemann of the Los Angeles Times]'' (June 23, 1986).  Retrieved via reagan.utexas.edu, [[2007-01-23]].</ref>

In addition to White and Rehnquist, Reagan appointee [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] began dissenting from the Court's abortion cases, arguing that the trimester-based analysis devised by the ''Roe'' Court was "unworkable."<ref>''Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health Inc.'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=462&invol=416 462 U.S. 416] (1983).  Findlaw.com.  Retrieved [[2007-01-26]]</ref>  Shortly before his retirement from the bench, Chief Justice Warren Burger suggested that ''Roe'' be "reexamined,"<ref>''Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=476&invol=747 476 U.S. 747] (1986).  Findlaw.com.</ref> and the associate justice who filled Burger's place on the Court, Justice [[Antonin Scalia]], has been a vigorous opponent of ''Roe''. Concerns over a possible overturning of ''Roe'' played a major role in the defeat of [[Robert Bork]]'s nomination to the Court, and the man eventually appointed to replace ''Roe'' supporter Lewis Powell was [[Anthony M. Kennedy]]. 

===''Webster v. Reproductive Health Services''===
In a 5-4 decision in 1989's ''[[Webster v. Reproductive Health Services]]'', Chief Justice Rehnquist, writing for the Court, declined to explicitly overrule ''Roe'', but did uphold several abortion restrictions and substantially modified the ''Roe'' trimester framework. In a concurring opinion, Justice O'Connor pointedly refused to reconsider ''Roe''. Justice Antonin Scalia, in a concurring opinion, refused to join the plurality's opinion because it refused to overrule ''Roe'', and criticized O'Connor's ambiguous position on the matter. Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], by now a passionate defender of his ''Roe'' opinion, dissented angrily, arguing that the plurality opinion signaled doom for the abortion right.

===''Planned Parenthood v. Casey''===
With the retirement of ''Roe'' supporters [[William J. Brennan]] and [[Thurgood Marshall]], and their replacement by judges [[David Souter]] and [[Clarence Thomas]], both appointed by President [[George H. W. Bush]], many predicted the demise of ''Roe''. For example, during the confirmation hearings of David Souter, [[National Organization for Women|NOW]] president [[Molly Yard]] declared that confirming Souter would mean "ending freedom for women in this country."<ref>Molly Yard, quoted in Al Kamen, "[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/18/AR2005091801188.html For Liberals, Easy Does it With Roberts]", ''Washington Post'' (Sept. 19, 2005).  Retrieved [[2007-01-23]].</ref>

In deliberations for ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'' (1992), an initial majority of 5 Justices that would have overturned ''Roe'' foundered when Justice Kennedy switched sides, resulting in a 5-4 vote to uphold ''Roe''.<ref>Nina Totenberg, "[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1745254 Documents Reveal Battle to Preserve 'Roe'; Court Nearly Reversed Abortion Ruling, Blackmun Papers Show]", ''NPR's Morning Edition'' (March 4, 2004).  Retrieved [[2007-01-30]].</ref>  A plurality of Reagan-Bush appointees, O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, reaffirmed that the Constitution protects a right of abortion.  Rehnquist and Scalia filed dissenting opinions which were joined by Justices White and Thomas, as well as by each other.  Justice Scalia's dissent acknowledged that the ability to get an abortion is of great importance to many women, but asserted that it is not a liberty protected by the Constitution, because the Constitution does not mention it, and because longstanding traditions of American society have permitted it to be legally proscribed.

===''Stenberg v. Carhart''===
During the 1990s, attempts were made at the state level to ban certain late-term abortions, which were struck down, again by a 5-4 vote, in ''[[Stenberg v. Carhart]]'' (2000), with Justice Kennedy, co-author of the ''Casey'' decision, among the dissenters.  Here is what Justice Kennedy wrote about those second trimester abortions that the states were ''not'' seeking to prohibit, in the ''Stenberg'' case: "The fetus, in many cases, dies just as a human adult or child would: It bleeds to death as it is torn from limb from limb. The fetus can be alive at the beginning of the dismemberment process and can survive for a time while its limbs are being torn off."  This statement raises questions about Justice Kennedy's continued support for ''Casey'' and ''Roe''.

===Activities of Norma McCorvey===

"Jane Roe," whose real name is [[Norma McCorvey]], became a member of the pro-life movement following her conversion to [[Christianity]], and now fights to make abortion illegal.  In 1998, she testified as follows to Congress: 

{{cquote|It was my pseudonym, Jane Roe, which had been used to create the "right" to abortion out of legal thin air. But Sarah Weddington and Linda Coffee never told me that what I was signing would allow women to come up to me 15, 20 years later and say, "Thank you for allowing me to have my five or six abortions. Without you, it wouldn't have been possible."  Sarah never mentioned women using abortions as a form of birth control. We talked about truly desperate and needy women, not women already wearing maternity clothes.<ref name="testimony">Testimony by Norma McCorvey to the Senate Subcommittee on the Constitution, Federalism and Property Rights (January 21, 1998), [http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:_2OpmxjMEyAJ:www.parliament.wa.gov.au/hansard/hans35.nsf/(ATT)/A4C48AF367A417A84825661A007776E1/%24file/C0520006.PDF quoted in the parliament of Western Australia (May 20, 1998)].  Retrieved [[2007-01-27]]</ref>}}

Using her prerogative as a party to the original litigation, she sought to reopen the case in a [[United States district court|U.S. District Court]] in Texas and have it overturned. Her stance was based on claims made since the decision, claiming evidence of emotional and other harm suffered by many women who have had abortions, and increased resources for the care of unwanted children. On [[June 19]], [[2003]], Judge [[David Godbey]] ruled that the motion was not made within a "reasonable time." The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals subsequently affirmed that decision, in the case of ''[[McCorvey v. Hill]]''.<ref>''[[McCorvey v. Hill]]'',  [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data2/circs/5th/0310711p.pdf 385 F3d 846] (5th Cir 2004).  Findlaw.com.  Retrieved [[2007-01-26]]</ref>  On [[February 22]], [[2005]], the Supreme Court refused to grant a [[certiorari|writ of certiorari]], ending McCorvey's appeal.

===State abortion bans===

On [[March 6]] [[2006]], [[Governor of South Dakota|South Dakota Governor]] [[Mike Rounds]]   signed into law a [[Women's Health and Human Life Protection Act]] which made performing all abortions a felony, including those for pregnancies resulting from rape and incest.  The bill included an exception for when a woman's life is in danger, while directing the physician to make a reasonable effort to save both mother and fetus.  This law was subsequently repealed in a referendum of [[November 7]] [[2006]].<ref>Megan Myers, "[http://www.commondreams.org/headlines06/1108-02.htm S.D. rejects abortion ban]", ''Argus Leader'', ([[2006-11-08]]).  Retrieved [[2007-01-23]].</ref>

On [[February 27]] [[2006]], [[Mississippi]]’s  House Public Health Committee voted to approve a ban on abortion similar to South Dakota’s. However, the bill failed after the House and Senate failed to agree on compromise legislation.<ref>Krystal MacIntyre, "[http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2006/03/mississippi-abortion-ban-bill-fails-as.php Mississippi abortion ban bill fails as legislators miss deadline for compromise]", ''Jurist News Archive'' ([[2006-03-28]]).  Retrieved [[2007-01-23]].</ref>

===Federal ban examined by Supreme Court===
In 2003, Congress passed a [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]], which is currently in litigation. The Supreme Court heard arguments in November 2006 on the issue, and a decision in ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]'' is expected in 2007.  Despite the Court's previous ruling in ''[[Stenberg v. Carhart]]'' that banning partial birth abortion is unconstitutional because such a ban would not allow for the health of the mother, the Court is again deciding whether to allow this ban because Congress researched the issue and passed a law reflecting its conclusion that this type of abortion is never necessary for the health of the mother. While the Court can trump Congressional laws if they are unconstitutional, the Court typically defers to Congress's findings of fact. Whether the Court decides for itself if Congress was clearly wrong, defers to the judgement call of Congress if Congress was not clearly wrong but the issue is reasonably disputable, or simply decides to follow Congress is yet to be seen. It is also possible that the Court will take this opportunity to revisit its holding in ''Roe''.  The case may illuminate how the newly appointed Justices, [[John Roberts]] and [[Samuel Alito]], reason about this and similar issues.
