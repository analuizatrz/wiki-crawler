'''American Eagle Outfitters''' is an [[:Category:Clothing companies of the United States|American clothing and accessories]] retailer based in the [[South Side (Pittsburgh)|South Side]] neighborhood of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. The brand dates back to [[1904]], but took its current form in [[1977]] when it was reorganized in Pittsburgh's north suburbs.  At one time, it sold brands such as Oshkosh in the early [[1980s]], similar to Gap selling Levi's.  

==Background==

American Eagle Outfitters is now commonly referred to by the abbreviation "American Eagle" or simply "AE" rather than its full title. American Eagle sells a full collection of [[apparel]] that includes basics such as jeans, cargo pants, and graphic tees, as well as accessories, outerwear, and footwear targeting the 15 to 25-year old demographic, primarily under the American Eagle Outfitters® and AE® brand names. The brand is ranked #2 in sales to its target demographic behind [[Old Navy]], according to the [[NPD Group]]. People from about 12 to 34 shop at the company's stores.

The majority of American Eagle Outfitters stores can be found in [[shopping centers]], and [[lifestyle center]]s. On [[January 29]], [[2006]], American Eagle Outfitters operated 869 stores in the [[United States]], the [[District of Columbia]], and [[Puerto Rico]].<ref>[http://www.investor.reuters.wallst.com/stocks/company-profile.asp?rpc=66&ticker=AEO Company Profile] at [[Reuters]]</ref> In [[Canada]], there are 71 stores. The company also operates a website on which it offers the same clothing, often with additional sizes and styles not found in the physical stores. 

Chairman of the Board [[Jay L. Schottenstein]] (who also has interests in [[Retail Ventures]], which owns [[Value City]] stores and [[DSW, Inc.|DSW]]) and related members of the Schottenstein, Deshe, and Diamond families own 14% of American Eagle, including shares owned beneficially through [[SEI, Inc]].

American Eagle Outfitters' designs can be described as a mix of [[preppy]], athletic and casual, commonly referred to in the industry as a "retro" style. It offers a full collection of products ranging from basic t-shirts, polos, wovens, cargos, corduroys, denims and shoes to more trendy and vintage-inspired graphics and logo-driven tops and distressed or hand-finished denims.

==Competition==
American Eagle Outfitters is often compared to the clothing companies [[Abercrombie & Fitch]] and [[Hollister Co.|Hollister]], due to their similar styles, marketing techniques, and targeted consumer demographic, as well as the department store private label brands [[Arizona Jean Company]] ([[JC Penney]]) and American Rag ([[Macy's]]).

American Eagle Outfitters brands much of their clothing with an embroidered landing [[eagle]], similar to [[Abercrombie & Fitch|Abercrombie and Fitch's]] standing [[moose]], [[Hollister Co.]]'s [[seagull]], and [[Aéropostale (clothing)|Aeropostale]]'s butterfly for females and bulldog for males. Additionally, American Eagle emphasizes on their date of establishment, [[1977]], in their marketing and design, branding the majority of their products with the date.

In [[2007]], textile and apparel workers union [[UNITE HERE]] launched the "American Vulture" back-to-school boycott of American Eagle [http://www.americanvulture.org] in protest of alleged workers' rights violations at the company's Canadian distribution contractor National Logistics Services (NLS).

==aerie==

[[Image:AeriebyAmericanEagle.jpg|right|thumb]]
aerie was announced in [[February 2006]] as an intimate apparel sub-brand offering bras, panties, and dormwear targeting American Eagle's core 15- to 25-year-old demographic segment. The sub brand's name, aerie, was chosen because it means eagle's nest and it well reflects the sub-brand. 

The side-by-side aerie/American Eagle stores will no longer be built. Aerie has been so successful that only stand alone store will be constructed to separate them selfs from American Eagle. New stand alone aerie shops are almost twice the size of previously constructed side-by-side locations. Aerie is rapidly expanding throughout malls in the US.

==Other brands==
In addition to its namesake brand, American Eagle, the company has developed and announced plans for several new brand and concept initiatives poised to drive new growth as the American Eagle brand nears saturation in current markets. One already launched brand being aerie. 

The company's second stand-alone lifestyle concept, [[Martin + Osa]], launched in the fall of 2006, targets men and women 25 to 40 years of age. 

The company has also indicated that a third lifestyle concept is in development that analysts speculate could be aimed at [[Baby Boomers]] (Born during 1945–65 period), and may offer homewares.

In the year [[2001]], the company acquired a [[Canada]]-based retail concept called [[Bluenotes]], which has approximately 100 stores averaging 3,300 square feet. The concept targeted a slightly younger demographic, ages 12-22, and was positioned as a denim-driven urban/suburban lifestyle brand. Due largely to poor performance, the Bluenotes business was sold to YM Inc. in [[2004]].

==AE All-Access pass==
In [[September 2005]], American Eagle Outfitters announced the All-Access Pass program. Customers are given a physical “All-Access Pass”, which is about the size of a credit card. If you register online for the AE All-Access Pass, you will be prompted to print off a temporary pass, while the actual card will be mailed to you in 2-3 weeks. Customers receiving the pass are also given two cards for their key rings and multiple stickers for MP3 players as well as Cell phones. Customers earn points when they present the card to the cashier at the store or enter the card number while checking out at AE.com. Each type of product earns a different amount of points – for example, jeans are worth 20 points. If you collect 50 points, you'll receive 10% your next purchase, 100 points earns you 20% off next purchase, and so on and so forth. Customers can earn coupons up to 40% off and 15% off around birthdays. The rewards are mailed out 4 times a year; one in December, one in March, one in June, and one in September

Launched in September, the new intimates sub-brand, featuring a full line of undies, bras and dorm-wear, is designed to be sweetly-sexy. The brand has been met with strong customer acceptance. The company's expansion plans are based on the positive results of three aerie stand-alone test stores. If new stores continue to perform as well as the test stores, aerie could be a 350+ store chain by [[2012]]. In the fourth quarter, American Eagle opened eight new AE stores and remodeled 20 locations
In [[2006]], 42 new AE stores opened and 65 remodels were completed. Together with five new MARTIN + OSA stores, and three new aerie stand-alone test stores, total gross square footage increased 8% for the year. In 2007, the company plans to open 45 to 50 AE stores, at least 15 aerie stand-alone stores and approximately 12 new MARTIN + OSA stores. Additionally, approximately 45 AE store remodels are planned, which combined with new store openings will generate total [[2007]] square footage growth of approximately 10%.{{Fact|date=March 2007}}
