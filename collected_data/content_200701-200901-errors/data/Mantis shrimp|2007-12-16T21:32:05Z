'''Mantis shrimp''' or '''stomatopods''' are marine crustaceans belonging to the [[order (biology)|order]] '''Stomatopoda''', one part of the [[class (biology)|class]] [[Malacostraca]], the largest class of crustaceans. They are neither [[shrimp]] nor [[Praying mantis|mantids]], but receive their name purely from the physical resemblance to both the terrestrial [[praying mantis]] and the shrimp. They may reach 30&nbsp;[[centimetre|cm]] (12&nbsp;[[inch|in]]) in length, although exceptional cases of up to 38&nbsp;[[centimetre|cm]] have been recorded&nbsp;<ref name="Hawaii">{{cite news| url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2003/Feb/14/ln/ln01a.html |author=James Gonser |publisher=[[Honolulu Advertiser]] |date=[[2003-02-14]] |title=Large shrimp thriving in Ala Wai Canal muck}}</ref>. The [[carapace]] of mantis shrimp covers only the rear part of the head and the first three segments of the [[thorax]]. Mantis shrimp appear in a variety of colours, from shades of browns to bright neon colours.

Called "sea grasshoppers" by ancient [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], "prawn killers" in Australia and now sometimes referred to as "thumb splitters" by modern [[Scuba diving|divers]] — because of the relative ease the creature has in mutilating small appendages — mantis shrimp sport powerful claws that they use to attack and kill prey by spearing, stunning or dismemberment. Mantis shrimp can break through [[aquarium]] glass with a single strike from this weapon&nbsp;<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/aprilholladay/2006-01-09-shrimp_x.htm |publisher=[[USA Today]] |date=[[2006-09-01]] |title=Shrimp spring into shattering action |author=April Holladay}}</ref>.

==Ecology==
These aggressive and typically solitary sea creatures spend most of their time hiding in rock formations or burrowing intricate passageways in the sea-bed. They either wait for prey to chance upon them or, unlike most crustaceans, actually hunt, chase and kill living prey. They rarely exit their homes except to feed and relocate, and can be [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]], [[Nocturnal animal|nocturnal]] or [[crepuscular]], depending on the species. Most species live in tropical and subtropical seas (Indian and Pacific Oceans between eastern Africa and Hawaii), although some live in temperate seas.

==Classification and the claw==
Around 400 [[species]] of mantis shrimp have currently been described worldwide; all living species are in the suborder '''Unipeltata'''&nbsp;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tolweb.org/Stomatopoda/6299 |title=Stomatopoda |work=[[Tree of Life Web Project]] |date=[[2002-01-01]]}}</ref>. They are commonly separated into two distinct groups determined by the manner of [[claw]]s they possess:
[[Image:Squilla mantis.jpg|left|thumb|''[[Squilla mantis]]'', showing the spearing appendages]]
*''Spearers'' are armed with spiny [[appendage]]s topped with barbed tips, used to stab and snag prey and some have a blunt, calcified club on the elbow.
*''Smashers'', on the other hand, possess a much more developed club and a more rudimentary spear (which is nevertheless quite sharp and still used in fights between their own kind); the club is used to bludgeon and smash their meals apart. The inner aspect of the dactyl (the terminal portion of the appendage) can also possess a sharp edge, with which the animal can cut prey while it swims.

Both types strike by rapidly unfolding and swinging their [[raptorial]] claws at the prey, and are capable of inflicting serious damage on victims significantly greater in size than themselves. In smashers, these two weapons are employed with blinding quickness, with an acceleration of 10,400&nbsp;''[[g-force|''g'']]'' and speeds of 23&nbsp;[[metre per second|m/s]] from a standing start &nbsp;<ref name="Patek et al.">{{cite journal |quotes=no |author=S. N. Patek, W. L. Korff, and R. L. Caldwell |year=2004 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=428 |pages=819-820 |title=Deadly strike mechanism of a mantis shrimp |doi=10.1038/428819a}}</ref>. Because they strike so rapidly, they generate [[cavitation]] bubbles between the appendage and the striking surface &nbsp;<ref name="Patek et al.">{{cite journal |quotes=no |author=S. N. Patek, W. L. Korff, and R. L. Caldwell |year=2004 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=428 |pages=819-820 |title=Deadly strike mechanism of a mantis shrimp |doi=10.1038/428819a}}</ref>. The collapse of these cavitation bubbles produce measurable forces on their prey in addition to the instantaneous forces of 1,500&nbsp;[[Newton|N]] that are caused by the impact of the appendage against the striking surface, which means that the prey is hit twice by a single strike; first by the claw and then by the collapsing cavitation bubbles that immediately follows &nbsp;<ref name="Patek and Caldwell">{{cite journal |quotes=no |author=S. N. Patek and R. L. Caldwell |year=2005 |journal=[[Journal of Experimental Biology (journal)|Journal of Experimental Biology]] |volume=208 |pages=3655-3664 |title=Extreme impact and cavitation forces of a biological hammer: strike forces of the peacock mantis shrimp |doi=10.1242/jeb.01831}}</ref>. Even if the initial strike misses the prey, the resulting shock wave can be enough to kill or stun the prey.

The snap can also produce [[sonoluminescence]] from the collapsing bubble. This will produce a very small amount of light and high temperatures in the range of several thousand [[Kelvin]] within the collapsing bubble, although both the light and high temperatures are too weak and short-lived to be detected without advanced scientific equipment. The light emission and temperature increase probably have no biological significance but are rather side-effects of the rapid snapping motion. [[Alpheidae|Pistol shrimp]] produce this effect in a very similar manner.

Smashers use this ability to attack [[snail]]s, [[crab]]s, [[mollusc]]s and rock [[oyster]]s; their blunt clubs enabling them to crack the shells of their prey into pieces. Spearers, on the other hand, prefer the meat of softer animals, like fish, which their barbed claws can more easily slice and snag.

==The eyes==
[[Image:Mantis_shrimp.jpg|thumb|The front of ''Lysiosquilla maculata'', showing the stalked eyes]]
Mantis shrimp are the only animals with [[hyperspectral]] [[colour vision]]. Their [[compound eye|eyes]] (both mounted on mobile stalks and constantly moving about independently of each other) are similarly variably coloured, and are considered to be the most complex eyes in the [[animal]] [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]]&nbsp;<ref>"Mantis shrimp have the world's most complex colour vision system." - Justin Marshall, University of Queensland</ref>. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailycal.org/sharticle.php?id=19671 |title=Mantis Shrimp Boasts most advanced eyes - Pr Roy Caldwell |date=[[2005-09-28]]}}</ref>
They permit both serial and parallel analysis of visual [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]].

Each compound eye is made up of up to 10,000 separate [[ommatidium|ommatidia]] of the [[Compound_eye#Apposition_eyes|apposition]] type. Each eye consists of two flattened [[Sphere|hemispheres]] separated by six parallel rows of highly specialised ommatidia, collectively called the midband, which divides the eye into three regions. This is a design which makes it possible for mantis shrimp to see objects with three different parts of the same eye. In other words, each individual eye possesses [[trinocular vision]] and [[depth perception]]. The upper and lower hemispheres are used primarily for recognition of forms and motion, not colour vision, like the eyes of many other crustaceans.

Rows 1-4 of the midband are specialised for colour vision, from [[ultraviolet|ultra-violet]] to [[Infrared|infra-red]]. The optical elements in these rows have eight different classes of visual pigments and the [[rhabdom]] is divided into three different [[pigmented layer]]s (tiers), each adapted for different [[wavelength]]s. The three tiers in rows 2 and 3 are separated by colour filters (intrarhabdomal filters) that can be divided into four distinct classes, two classes in each row. It is organised like a sandwich; a tier, a colour filter of one class, a tier again, a colour filter of another class, and then a last tier. Rows 5-6 are segregated into different tiers too, but have only one class of visual pigment (a ninth class) and are specialised for polarisation vision. They can detect different planes of [[Polarization|polarised light]]. A tenth class of visual pigment is found in the dorsal and ventral hemispheres of the eye.

The midband only covers a small area of about 5[[Degree (angle)|°]]-10° of the visual field at any given instant, but like in most crustaceans, the eyes are mounted on stalks. In mantis shrimps the movement of the stalked eye is unusually free, and can be driven in all possible axes, up to at least 70°, of movement by eight individual eyecup muscles divided into six functional groups. By using these muscles to scan the surroundings with the midband, they can add information about forms, shapes and landscape which cannot be detected by the upper and lower hemisphere of the eye. They can also track moving objects using large, rapid eye movements where the two eyes move independently. By combining different techniques, including [[saccadic]] movements, the midband can cover a very wide range of the visual field.

Some species have at least 16 different photoreceptor types, which are divided into four classes (their spectral sensitivity is further tuned by colour filters in the retinas), 12 of them for colour analysis in the different wavelengths (including four which are sensitive to [[ultraviolet]] light) and four of them for analysing polarised light. By comparison, humans have only four visual pigments. The visual information leaving the [[retina]] seems to be processed into numerous parallel [[data stream]]s leading into the [[central nervous system]], greatly reducing the analytical requirements at higher levels.

===Reasons given for powerful eyesight===
** The eyes of mantis shrimp may make them able to recognise different types of coral, prey species (which are often transparent or semi-transparent), or predators, such as [[barracuda]], which have shimmering scales. Alternatively, the manner in which mantis shrimp hunt (very rapid movements of the claws) may require very accurate ranging information, which would require accurate depth perception.

The fact that those with the most advanced vision also are the species with the most colourful bodies, suggests the colour vision has taken the same direction as the [[peacock]]'s tail.

During mating rituals, mantis shrimp actively [[fluoresce]], and the wavelength of this fluorescence was shown to match the wavelengths detected by their eye pigments&nbsp;<ref name="Hawaii"/>. Females are only fertile during certain phases of the [[tidal cycle]]; the ability to perceive the [[lunar phase|phase of the moon]] may therefore help prevent wasted mating efforts. It may also give mantis shrimp information about the size of the tide, which is important for species living in shallow water near the shore.

Another theory is that the [[invertebrate]] [[brain]] is unequipped to analyse all the incoming data in [[real time]] and so the processing is performed physically by the eye.

==Behaviour==
Mantis shrimp appear to be highly intelligent, are long-lived and exhibit complex behaviour, such as ritualised fighting. Scientists have discovered that some species use [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] patterns on their bodies for signaling with their own and maybe even other species, expanding their range of behavioural signals. They can learn and remember well, and are able to recognise individual neighbours with whom they frequently interact. They can recognise them by visual signs and even by individual smell. Many have developed a complex social behaviour to defend their space from rivals.

In a lifetime, they can have as many as 20 or 30 breeding episodes. Depending on the species, the eggs can be laid and kept in a burrow, or carried around under the female's tail until they hatch. Also depending on the species, male and female come together only to mate or bond in [[monogamous]] long-term [[relationships]].

In the monogamous species, the mantis shrimp remain with the same partner for up to 20 years. They share the same burrow, and there are reasons to suspect that these pairs can coordinate their activities. Both sexes often take care of the eggs (biparental care). In ''Pullosquilla'' and some species in ''Nannosquilla'', the female will lay two clutches of eggs, one that the male tends and one that the female tends. In other species, the female will look after the eggs while the male hunts for both of them. Once the eggs hatch the offspring may spend up to three months as [[plankton]].

Most stomatopods display the standard [[locomotion]] types as seen in [[shrimp|true shrimp]] and [[lobsters]]. One species, Nannosquilla decemspinosa, has been observed flipping itself into a crude wheel. The species lives in shallow, sandy areas. At low tides, N. decemspinosa is often stranded by its short rear legs, which are sufficient when the body is supported by water. The mantis shrimp then performs a forward flip, in attempts to roll towards the next tidepool. Caldwell once observed an N. decemspinosa roll repeatedly for a total of six feet.

==Cookery==
[[Image:MantisShrimpLyd.jpg|thumb]]
In [[Japanese cuisine]], the mantis shrimp is eaten boiled as [[sashimi]] and as a [[sushi]] topping, and is called ''shako'' ({{lang|ja|蝦蛄}}). It is commonly served in [[Japan]], but is not often found on the menu at sushi restaurants in the [[United States]]&nbsp;{{fact|date=July 2007}}.

In [[Cantonese cuisine]], the mantis shrimp is a popular dish known as "pissing shrimp" ({{lang|zh-hk|攋尿蝦}}, [[Mandarin (linguistics)|Mandarin]] [[pinyin]]: ''lài niào xiā'', [[Cantonese (linguistics)|modern Cantonese]]: ''laaih niuh hā'') due to its tendency to urinate when cooked&nbsp;{{fact|date=July 2007}}. Because of this, mantis shrimp are speared to induce them to evacuate their bowels prior to being introduced into the cookpot&nbsp;{{fact|date=July 2007}}. After cooking, their flesh is closer to that of [[lobster]]s than that of [[shrimp]], and like lobsters, their shells are quite hard and require some pressure to crack.

In the [[Mediterranean]] countries the ''[[Squilla mantis]]'' mantis shrimp is a common seafood, especially on the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coasts.

The usual concerns associated with consuming seafood are an issue with mantis shrimp, as they may dwell in contaminated waters. This is especially true in [[Hawaii]] where some have grown unnaturally large&nbsp;<ref name="Hawaii"/>.

==Aquariums==
Saltwater aquarists are currently caring for stomatopods across the world. These aquarists may play a major role in understanding the many mysteries involving the mantis shrimp. However, mantis shrimp are considered by many domestic marine aquarists as pests. They can often sneak into a tank hidden in rocks, and once there, they can feed on fish, corals, and smaller crustaceans. They are notoriously difficult to catch once established in a well stocked tank&nbsp;<ref>{{cite book |author=Nick Dakin |year=2004 |title=The Marine Aquarium |publisher=London: Andromeda |id=ISBN 1-902389-67-0}}</ref> and have been known to crack aquariums<ref>http://www.blueboard.com/mantis/sighting/report1.htm</ref>.
