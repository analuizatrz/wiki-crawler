'''[[Geography]]''' is the study of the [[World]] and its features and of the distribution of life on the earth, including human life and the effects of human activity. Geography research addresses both the questions of ''where'', as well as ''why'', geographical phenomena occur.  Geography is a diverse field that seeks to understand the world and all of its human and natural complexities &mdash; not merely where objects are, but how they came to be, and how they have changed since then.  Geography is comprised of two main branches: [[human geography]] and [[physical geography]].  Basic topics in geography include:

== Branches of geography ==

Geography is divided into 2 main branches: [[physical geography]] and [[human geography]]. Each of these branches is divided into a number of subfields:<br clear=both>

== Geography by region or location ==
: ''Main articles: [[Region]], [[Subregions]], [[Location (geography)|Location]], and [[Lists of places]]''
''Regions'' are areas, and can be defined by physical characteristics, human characteristics, and functional characteristics. The term is used in various ways among the different branches of geography. A region can be seen as a collection of smaller units, as in "the New England states", or as one part of a larger whole, as in "the state of New York, located in the United States".  Concepts concerning location or place include:

{{col-begin}}

=== Regions of the world ===
{{main|Regional geography}}
''Regional geography'' is a branch of geography that studies the regions of all sizes across the [[Earth]]. It has a prevailing descriptive character. The main aim is to understand or define the uniqueness or character of a particular region which consists of natural as well as human elements. Attention is paid also to regionalization which covers the proper techniques of space delimitation into regions.

==== The Continents ====
{{main|Continent}}

A ''continent'' is one of several large [[landmass]]es on [[Earth]].  They are generally identified by [[convention]] rather than any specific criteria, but seven areas are commonly regarded as continents. They are:

=== Demographics by region ===
{{main|Demography|World population}}

''Demography'' is the statistical study of [[populations]]. It is an applied science used to analyze [[population dynamics|dynamic populations]], that is, those that change over time or space.  It encompasses the study of the size, structure and distribution of populations, and spatial and/or temporal changes in them in response to [[birth]], [[death]], [[Migration (human)|migration]]  and [[aging]].

A ''landform'' is part of the [[terrain]], defined by its shape and location in the landscape, and is typically an element of [[topography]].  Landforms are characterized by aspects such as elevation, slope, orientation, [[stratification]], rock exposure, and soil type.  Examples of landforms include:

==== Bodies of water ====
{{main|Body of water}}

A ''body of water'' is any significant accumulation of [[water]] on a geographical scale.  Some bodies of water can be man-made, but most are naturally occurring.  Some bodies of water collect and move water, such as rivers and streams, and others primarily hold water, such as lakes and oceans. Bodies of water that are [[navigation|navigable]] are known as [[waterways]].

{{main|Geographer|List of geographers|List of Graeco-Roman geographers}}

A ''geographer'' is a [[scientist]] who studies [[Earth]]'s physical [[natural environment|environment]] and [[human]] [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]]. Geographers are historically known for making [[map]]s, the subdiscipline of geography known as [[cartography]].  But they are not only capable of studying the physical details of the environment but also its impact on human and [[wildlife]] [[ecology|ecologies]], [[weather]] and [[climate]] patterns, [[economics]], and [[culture]]. Geographers especially focus on the spatial relationships between these elements.
