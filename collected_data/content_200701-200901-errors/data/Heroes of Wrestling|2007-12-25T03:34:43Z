'''Heroes of Wrestling''' was a [[professional wrestling]] [[pay-per-view]] event that took place on [[October 10]] [[1999]] from the [[Hollywood Casino Bay St. Louis|Casino Magic]] in [[Bay St. Louis, Mississippi]].

Playing off the recent rise in popularity of pro wrestling at the time, [[Bill Stone]], president of [[Fosstone Productions]] organized what was intended to be a series of pay-per-view (PPV) events consisting of wrestling stars from the [[1980s]] and early [[1990s]]. Stone had three subsequent PPV shows (to be broadcast on a quarterly schedule) already in the planning stages if the first one achieved the break-even point of 40,000 PPV buys.<ref name=40Kgoal>{{cite web|url= 
http://www.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive/sep30_heroes.html|title=Reasonable goal for Heroes of Wrestling|accessdate=2007-05-13}}</ref> Heroes of Wrestling only did 29,000 PPV buys, so Stone scrapped all future shows. In addition, Stone was furious with the lackluster show itself, and especially the antics of [[Jake Roberts|Jake "The Snake" Roberts]]. The show was heavily criticized and ridiculed by the wrestling press, some going as far as calling it the worst wrestling PPV event ever produced. Heroes of Wrestling was declared a failure by the wrestling mainstream. <ref name=ppvdissapoints>{{cite web|url= http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive/oct11_her.html|title=Heroes PPV a dissapointment|accessdate=2007-05-13}}</ref>

== Controversy and a legendary performance ==
The most memorable and controversial moment of the show involved the last match of the evening. Jake Roberts cut a rambling, incoherent [[promo (professional wrestling)|promo]] in which he heavily slurred his words (see [[#The infamous Jake Roberts interview|below]]).<ref name="drunkjake">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlecrap.com/induction%20files/heroesofwrestling/jakeinterview.rm|title=Jake interview|accessdate=2007-05-13|format=RealMedia}}</ref> Minutes later, he staggered toward the ring, apparently drunk, for his scheduled match with [[Jim Neidhart]]. However, due to internal chaos backstage (involving Neidhart refusing to go through with the pre-planned finish of a match just moments before he stepped through the curtain), the singles match had to be turned into an impromptu [[tag team]] match of Neidhart and [[King Kong Bundy]] fighting against Roberts and [[Rodney Anoa'i|Yokozuna]]. As the match proceeded with none of the participants knowing what the new finish was going to be, a mini Bundy lookalike strolled down to ringside and choked Yokozuna while telling him the new finish.{{Fact|date=May 2007}}

Roberts, whose judgment was apparently already impaired, was not happy with the change in the planned finish (Jake would now have to take the [[pin (wrestling)|pin]]) and proceeded to show just how unhappy the change made him. During the match, when his snake Damien wriggled free from the bag, he waved the snake toward the audience while it was protruding from his crotch, simulating an erect [[penis]]. He then stroked Damien, simulating [[masturbation]]. He also asked an obliging female fan at ringside to fondle his [[pectoral]] muscles. 

The show also suffered from changes to the advertised card. The billed Main Event, Bundy vs. Yokozuna, did not occur, and [[Gordon Solie]] was advertised as the show's commentator but could not appear due to his failing health.{{Fact|date=May 2007}} Critics panned the performance of Solie's replacement, [[Randy Rosenbloom]].<ref name="nosolie">{{cite web|url= http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/video_reviews/32821/The-SmarK-Retro-Repost---Heroes-Of-Wrestling.htm|title=The SmarK Retro Repost - Heroes Of Wrestling|accessdate=2007-05-13}}</ref> During one match, Rosenbloom called a [[dropkick]] a "flying leg kick."<ref name="dropkick">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlecrap.com/induction%20files/heroesofwrestling/flyinglegkick.rm|title=Rosenbloom messes up basic move names|accessdate=2007-05-13|format=RealMedia}}</ref>

The show was originally going to be called ''Legends of Wrestling'' but was changed when it was decided that the term 'legend' had negative age connotations. [[The Honky Tonk Man]] in particular was offended by the term. He refused to be on the show since he was "too young" to be a legend.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

== The infamous Jake Roberts interview ==
Just before the main event, held at Casino Magic, Jake "The Snake" Roberts was interviewed in a [[promo (wrestling)|promo]] where he was supposed to tell the audience how he was going to defeat Neidhart. However, Roberts was heavily under the influence of drugs and/or [[alcohol]].

"You don't want to play cards with me because I cheat. Okay? I cheat. You wanna play 21? I've got 22. You want to play [[blackjack]]? I've got two of those too," Roberts said in the interview. 

After the interview, he entered the ring with his snake Damian. He eventually took the snake out and simuated [[masturbation]] (with the snake representing his [[penis]]) for several seconds before lying on the floor. Eventually, the promoters sent out [[King Kong Bundy]] and [[Rodney Anoa'i|Yokozuna]] to try to make something of the proceedings. Eventually, Bundy pinned Roberts after beating Roberts with a chair. <ref>http://www.onlineonslaught.com/columns/oo/20030724.shtml</ref>
