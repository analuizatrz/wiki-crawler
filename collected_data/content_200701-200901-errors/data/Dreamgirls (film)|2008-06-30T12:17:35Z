'''''Dreamgirls'''''  is a [[2006 in film|2006]] [[Cinema of the United States|American]] [[musical film]], directed by [[Bill Condon]] and jointly produced and released by [[DreamWorks|DreamWorks Pictures]] and [[Paramount Pictures]]. The film debuted in three special [[road show]] engagements beginning [[December 15]], [[2006]], with a nationwide release on [[December 25]], [[2006]] and a [[home video]] release on [[May 1]], [[2007]]. ''Dreamgirls'' won three awards at the [[64th Golden Globe Awards]] ceremony in 2007, including [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy|Best Picture - Musical or Comedy]], and won two [[Oscars]] at the [[79th Academy Awards]].

A [[period piece]] set in the 1960s and 1970s with a primarily [[African-American]] cast, ''Dreamgirls'' is [[film adaptation|adapted]] from the 1981 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[Musical theatre|musical]] [[Dreamgirls|of the same name]]. The musical was based on the history and evolution of American [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] music during the eras of [[doo-wop]], [[soul music|soul]], the [[Motown Sound]], [[funk]], and [[disco]]. In addition, the stage musical contains several allusions to the lives and careers of [[Motown Records]] act [[The Supremes]], a connection the film version expands upon.<ref>(Feb 2, 2007). "[http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,2003605,00.html I literally pinch myself every day]." ''The Guardian''. Retrieved 2007-02-27.</ref> ''Dreamgirls'' follows the lives of Effie White, Deena Jones, and Lorrell Robinson, three young women who form an R&B singing trio from [[Detroit, Michigan]] called "The Dreamettes".  Thanks to manipulative agent and record executive Curtis Taylor, Jr., the Dreamettes become famous as the backing group for soul singer James "Thunder" Early. Conflict arises when Curtis transforms "The Dreamettes" into the [[pop music|pop]]-friendly "Dreams," particularly when he has Deena replace Effie as both lead singer of the group and as his romantic interest.

The film adaptation of ''Dreamgirls'' stars [[Jamie Foxx]], [[Beyoncé Knowles]], [[Eddie Murphy]], and [[Jennifer Hudson]], who won the 2007 [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her portrayal of Effie White. The film also features [[Danny Glover]], [[Anika Noni Rose]], [[Keith Robinson (actor)|Keith Robinson]], [[Sharon Leal]], and [[Hinton Battle]]. Produced by [[Laurence Mark]], ''Dreamgirls'' was adapted for the screen by director Bill Condon from the original Broadway book by [[Tom Eyen]] and the Broadway songs by Eyen and [[Henry Krieger]]. Four new songs, composed by Krieger with various lyricists, were added for this film.

==Plot summary==

As in the original stage musical, ''Dreamgirls'' is broken up into two acts: the first taking place from 1962 to 1965, and the second taking place from 1973 to 1975.

===Act I===
The film begins in Detroit, Michigan in 1962, as an amateur African-American girl group known as The Dreamettes enter a talent competition at the Detroit Theater. Backstage, the three girls — full-figured lead singer Effie White (Jennifer Hudson), Deena Jones (Beyoncé Knowles) and Lorrell Robinson (Anika Noni Rose) — meet Curtis Taylor, Jr., an ambitious Cadillac dealer with plans of breaking into the music business. Placing himself as their manager, Curtis arranges for the Dreamettes to tour as backup for a regional R&B star, James "Thunder" Early (Eddie Murphy). The tour takes the company - also including Effie's songwriting brother C.C. (Keith Robinson) and Jimmy's manager Marty (Danny Glover) - across the country on the [[chitlin' circuit]].

Hoping to help Jimmy and the girls cross over to mainstream audiences, Curtis starts his own record label, Rainbow Records ("The Sound of Tomorrow"), out of his car dealership's office, and makes C.C. his head songwriter. However, when Rainbow's first single fails after a white pop group releases a cover version, Curtis and his sidekick Wayne (Hinton Battle) turn to [[payola]]. By paying the right people, Curtis manages to get Jimmy and the Dreamettes to the top of the Billboard Hot 100 and into a headlining gig at the Apollo Theater. Offstage, Effie is quickly becoming infatuated with the slick-talking Curtis, and Jimmy - a married man - begins an adulterous affair with Lorrell, who becomes equally as lovesick as Effie.

Marty grows weary of Curtis' plans to make Jimmy's image and sound more pop-friendly, to the point that he walks out on Jimmy, both his client and best friend. However, when Curtis finds that he cannot completely remake Jimmy Early into a pop act, he shifts his attention back to the Dreamettes. Feeling that Effie's voice is too "special" and her figure too large to attract white audiences, Curtis appoints the slimmer Deena as the lead singer of the Dreamettes.

With the aid of new songs and a new more glamorous image, Curtis and C.C. transform The Dreamettes into The Dreams, a top selling pop act whose popularity comes to rival that of The Beatles by 1965. However, the betrayed Effie does not take kindly to being reduced to Deena's backup, and begins acting out, becoming even more unruly when Curtis's affections also turn towards Deena. When Effie, feeling ill, does not turn up to rehearse for the Dreams' debut in [[Las Vegas]] on [[New Year's Eve]] 1966, Curtis replaces Effie with his secretary, Michelle Morris (Sharon Leal). Effie, who has just learned she is pregnant, arrives at the [[Caesar's Palace]] venue just as Michelle does, and after a nearly violent argument, finds herself without her group, without her brother, and without Curtis.

===Act II===
Eight years later, Effie has become a depressed but caring [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] mother, and her career in music is over. She and her seven-year-old daughter Magic ([[Mariah I. Wilson]]) live alone in the burnt-out inner city of 1973 [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] with only Effie's father Ronald ([[Alexander Folk]]) to look in on them. On the other hand, Rainbow Records has moved to [[Los Angeles]], where it prospers with Deena Jones & the Dreams and many other pop acts. Wanting to expand his empire into film, Curtis plans to have an unwilling Deena, now his wife, star in a [[blaxploitation]] musical version of ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]''. Hoping that the struggling film project will never get off the ground, Deena begins secretly meeting with other studios to take a part in another film.

Though still part of the Rainbow roster, Jimmy Early's stardom has long faded, and Curtis has little interest in revitalizing his career. Unsatisfied with both his wife Melba ([[Dawnn Lewis]]) and his long-term mistress Lorrell, Jimmy turns to drugs for affection. Meanwhile, C.C. continues to reach out to Effie, who stubbornly ignores the letters and money he sends. Eventually, Effie swallows her pride and, with Marty as her manager, returns to singing and secures gigs at a small Detroit club.

In 1974, Rainbow Records hosts a tenth anniversary TV special. Midway through his set, Jimmy decides that he cannot sing any more "sad songs", so he breaks down onstage and launches into a wild [[James Brown]]-type [[funk]] number. The audience seems to love it, but the act goes too far during the end when Jimmy drops his pants on live television. Curtis consequently terminates Jimmy's contract, and Lorrell ends the eight-year affair. Some time later, Jimmy's body is found at an L.A. hotel, having died of an apparent [[heroin]] overdose.

C.C., angry over Jimmy's death and frustrated with Curtis's tampering with his music, walks out on Rainbow Records and heads back to Detroit and to Effie. The two siblings reconcile and work together to produce Effie's comeback single, "[[One Night Only (song)|One Night Only]]". Just as the record begins gaining radio play in Detroit, however, Curtis strikes. Using [[payola]], he forces radio DJs to play a [[disco]] cover of "One Night Only" by Deena Jones & the Dreams instead of Effie's original, and the Dreams' version becomes a major hit in early 1975.

Curtis has also learned of Deena's covert meetings with other film producers and asserts his control over his wife. Rebuffed, Deena sneaks into Curtis' office, where she discovers evidence of Curtis' [[payola]] schemes and finds a copy of Effie's version of "One Night Only". She calls Effie and C.C., who arrive at the Rainbow offices with Marty and a lawyer. As Deena and Effie reconcile, Curtis works out a deal with the lawyer to avoid being reported to the [[FBI]] for payola: Rainbow Records will fund a new label for C.C., which will allow Effie's record national distribution. Curtis then confronts Deena, only to find that Effie's victory has inspired Deena to leave him and make it on her own.

As a result, Deena Jones & the Dreams give a farewell performance at the Detroit Theater. At the conclusion of the concert, Effie joins Deena, Lorrell, and Michelle onstage and the reunited Dreams give one final performance of their signature song, "Dreamgirls", with Effie singing lead. As the concert ends, Curtis notices Magic in the front row and realizes that he is the girl's father.

==Production history==
===Pre-production===
Since the 1980s, several different attempts have been made to produce a film adaptation of ''[[Dreamgirls]]'', a Broadway musical loosely based upon the story of [[The Supremes]] and [[Motown Records]], which won six [[Tony Awards]] in 1982. [[David Geffen]], the stage musical's co-financier, retained the film rights to ''Dreamgirls'' and turned down many offers to adapt the story for the screen. He cited a need to preserve the integrity of ''Dreamgirls'' stage director [[Michael Bennett]]'s work after his 1987 death.<ref name="DavidGeffen">Marr, Melissa (Dec 8, 2006). "[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06342/744656-254.stm After 'Dreamgirls', Geffen says goodbye to movies]". ''The Wall-Street Journal''. Retrieved on December 9, 2006 </ref> In 1987, Geffen, who ran his [[Warner Bros.]]-associated [[Geffen Pictures]] film production company at the time, began talks with Broadway lyricist and producer [[Howard Ashman]] to adapt it as a star vehicle for [[Whitney Houston]], who was to portray Deena. The production ran into problems when Houston wanted to sing both Deena's and Effie's songs (particularly "And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going"), and the film was eventually abandoned.<ref name="EarlyMovieVers">Hill, Jeremy.

===Stage to script changes===
While much of the stage musical's story remains intact, a number of significant changes were made. The Dreams' hometown—the setting for much of the action—was moved from [[Chicago]] to Detroit, the real-life hometown of [[The Supremes]] and [[Motown Records]]. The roles of many of the characters are related more closely to their real-life inspirations, following a suggestion by Geffen.<ref name="DavidGeffen" /> For example, Curtis Taylor's music empire expands beyond Deena Jones & the Dreams, to more closely resemble that of [[Berry Gordy]]'s Motown; and C.C. White, as the head of songwriting and production at Rainbow Records, is more clearly a [[Smokey Robinson]] analogue than he was in the original play. Other changes include the relocating of the talent show which opens the film from the [[Apollo Theater]] Amateur Night to a local showcase in Detroit and introducing the character Michelle Morris earlier in the story. 

Warner Bros. had retained the film rights to ''Dreamgirls'', and agreed to co-produce the film with DreamWorks. However, after casting was completed, the film was budgeted at $73 million and Warner backed out of the production. Geffen, taking the role of co-producer, brought Paramount Pictures in to co-finance and release ''Dreamgirls''. During the course of production, Paramount's parent company, [[Viacom]], would purchase DreamWorks, aligning the two studios under one umbrella.<ref name="DavidGeffen" /> The completed film had a production budget of $75 million, making ''Dreamgirls'' the most expensive film with an all-black starring cast in cinema history.<ref name="MostExpensive">Gottfried, Marvin (2007).

===Casting and rehearsal===
Producers wanted [[Jamie Foxx]] to play the lead role of Curtis Taylor, Jr., but the actor initially declined the part because DreamWorks could not meet his salary demands. [[Denzel Washington]], [[Will Smith]], and [[Terrence Howard]] were among the actors later approached to play Curtis.<ref> Johnson, Pamela K. (Aug 2005).

Digital version retrieved on December 14, 2006.</ref> In the meantime, R&B singer Beyoncé Knowles was cast as Deena Jones after a successful [[screen test]].<ref name="DavidGeffen" /> Comedian [[Eddie Murphy]], who had a brief musical career in the 1980s, was cast as James "Thunder" Early after being successfully convinced to do so by DreamWorks co-founder [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]].<ref name="DavidGeffen" /> As a result, ''Dreamgirls'' became Murphy's first film for Paramount [[Vampire in Brooklyn|since 1995]]; the actor at one time had an exclusive contract with that studio.

Upon learning that Knowles and Murphy had signed on, Foxx rethought his original decision and accepted the role at DreamWorks' lower salary.<ref name="EWarticle">Daly, Steve (November 10, 2006).

[[Anika Noni Rose]], a Broadway veteran and a [[Tony Award]] winner, won the part of Lorrell Robinson after an extensive auditioning process. Rose, significantly shorter than most of her co-stars at five feet and two inches, was required to wear (and dance in) four and five-inch (127 mm)  heels for much of the picture, which she later stated caused her discomfort.<ref name="EWarticle" /> This is not Rose's first screen appearance with an ''American Idol'' contestant; she was also in the unsuccessful film ''[[From Justin to Kelly]]'' with [[Kelly Clarkson]] and [[Justin Guarini]].

The most crucial casting decision involved the role of Effie White, the emotional center of the story. It was decided that a relative unknown would be cast, paralleling the casting of then-21-year-old [[Jennifer Holliday]] in that role for the original Broadway production. A total of 783 singing actresses auditioned for the role of Effie White, with two of the top contenders being ''[[American Idol]]'' alumnae [[Fantasia (singer)|Fantasia Barrino]] and [[Jennifer Hudson]]. Hudson was eventually selected to play Effie, leading Barrino to call Hudson on the phone and jokingly complain that Hudson "stole [Barrino's] part."<ref>(Dec. 5 2005).

Although rehearsals ended just before Christmas 2005, Bill Condon called Hudson back for a week of one-on-one rehearsals, to help her more fully become the "[[diva]]" character of Effie. Hudson was required to be rude and come in late both on set and off, and she and Condon went over Effie's lines and scenes throughout the week.<ref name="EWarticle" />

[[Loretta Devine]], who played Lorrell in the original Broadway play, has a cameo in the film as a jazz singer who performs the song "I Miss You, Old Friend". Another ''Dreamgirls'' veteran present in the film is [[Hinton Battle]], who was a summer replacement for James "Thunder" Early onstage and here portrays Curtis' aide-de-camp Wayne.

===Principal photography===
Principal photography on ''Dreamgirls'' began [[January 6]], [[2006]] with the filming of dance footage for the first half of "Steppin' to the Bad Side", footage later deleted from the film.<ref name="productionschedule">Coker, Cheo Hodari (2007).

Beyoncé Knowles elected to lose weight to give the mature Deena Jones of the 1970s a different look than the younger version of the character. By sticking to a highly publicized diet of water and cayenne pepper, Knowles rapidly lost twenty pounds, which she gained back once production ended.<ref>(May 22, 2006).

===Music===
''Dreamgirls'' musical supervisors Randy Spendlove and Matt Sullivan hired R&B production team [[The Underdogs (duo)|The Underdogs]] - Harvey Mason, Jr. and Damon Thomas - to restructure and rearrange the [[Henry Krieger]]/[[Tom Eyen]] ''Dreamgirls'' score so that it better reflected its proper time period, yet was also made to reflect modern R&B/pop sensibilities.<ref name="DGMusic"> Coker, Cheo Hodari (2007).

Revising the ''Dreamgirls'' score for film required the reduction of a significant portion of it. Much of the [[recitative]], or sung dialogue, from the original musical was replaced with spoken dialogue. While most of the major musical moments from the stage musical are retained in the film, nine of the thirty-two individual ''Dreamgirls'' songs were omitted from the film. Among these are Lorrell's solo "Ain't No Party", "Press Conference", and "Party, Party". Also removed is the musical's choral refrain of "showbiz...it's just showbiz". C.C. and Effie's sung reunion from the second act, labeled "Effie, Sing My Song" for the film version, was shot but replaced with an alternative spoken version after test screenings.<ref name="singmysong" />

Four new songs were added for the film, "[[Love You I Do]]", "[[Patience (Dreamgirls song)|Patience]]", "Perfect World", and "[[Listen (song)|Listen]]". All of the new songs feature music composed by original ''Dreamgirls'' stage composer Henry Krieger. With Tom Eyen having passed away in 1991, various lyricists were brought in by Krieger to co-author the new songs. "Love You I Do", with lyrics by [[Siedah Garrett]], is performed in the film by Effie during a rehearsal at the Rainbow Records studio. [[Willie Reale]] wrote the lyrics for "Patience", a song performed in the film by Jimmy, Lorrell, C.C., and a gospel choir as the characters attempt to record a "message song" for Jimmy. "Perfect World", also featuring lyrics by Garrett, is performed during the Rainbow 10th anniversary special sequence by [[Jackson 5]] doppelgängers The Campbell Connection. "[[Listen (song)|Listen]]", with additional music by [[Scott Cutler]] & [[Beyoncé Knowles]], and lyrics by [[Anne Preven]], is presented as a defining moment for Deena's character late in the film.

The ''[[Dreamgirls: Music from the Motion Picture]]'' [[soundtrack album]] was released on [[December 5]] by Music World Entertainment/[[Columbia Records]], in both a single-disc version containing highlights and a double-disc "Deluxe Version" containing all of the film's songs. The single-disc version of the soundtrack peaked at number-one on the [[Billboard 200]] during a slow sales week in early January 2007.<ref>Hasty, Katie (Jan. 10, 2007).

Following the success of the Cannes screening, DreamWorks and Paramount began a widespread "[[For Your Consideration]]" advertisement campaign, raising several eyebrows by demoting Jennifer Hudson to consideration for Best Supporting Actress and presenting Beyoncé Knowles as the sole Best Actress candidate, as opposed to having both compete for Best Actress awards.

To give the story more exposure for the upcoming film release, DreamWorks Pictures and the licenser of the original play, The Tams-Witmark Music Library, announced that they would pay the licensing fees for all non-professional stage performances of ''Dreamgirls'' for the calendar year of 2006. DreamWorks hoped to encourage amateur productions of ''Dreamgirls'', and familiarize a wider audience with the play. As a result, more than fifty high schools, colleges, community theaters, and other non-commercial theater entities staged productions of ''Dreamgirls'' in 2006, and DreamWorks spent up to $250,000 subsidizing the licensing.<ref> Olsen, Mark (Dec. 12, 2006).

Aside from the overall plot of the film and elements already present in the stage musical, many direct references to Supremes, Motown, or R&B/soul history in general are included in the film.
