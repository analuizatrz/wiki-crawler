'''Mackinac Island''' ([[IPA chart for English|pronounced]] {{IPA|[ˈmækɪˌnɔː]}}, like MACK-in-aw, note the silent "c") is a small island, 9.779&nbsp;km² (3.776&nbsp;mi²) in land area, in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Michigan]]. It is located in [[Lake Huron]], at the eastern end of the [[Straits of Mackinac]], between the state's [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper]] and [[Lower Peninsula of Michigan|Lower Peninsulas]].<ref name="HistplacesPDF"/>  The island's strategic position amidst the commerce of the [[fur trade]] of the [[Great Lakes]] led to the establishment of [[Fort Mackinac]] on the island by the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. It was the scene of two strategic battles during the [[War of 1812]].<ref name="High Cliffs"/>

In the late [[19th century]] the island became a popular tourist attraction and [[summer colony]]. It is well known for its ban on automobiles and its [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] resort hotels, especially the [[Grand Hotel (Mackinac Island)|Grand Hotel]]. Of the island's total area, over 80% is preserved as [[Mackinac Island State Park]].<ref name="Historic Treasure"/>

==History==
===Early history===
Mackinac Island, in the tradition of some of its earliest known inhabitants, the [[Anishinaabe]]-[[Ojibwe]] tribes, is a sacred place, home to the spirit [[Gitche Manitou]]. The island was a gathering place for local tribes where offerings were made to Gitche Manitou and was where tribal chiefs were buried. The first European who is likely to have seen Mackinac Island is [[Jean Nicolet]], a French-Canadian [[coureur de bois]], during his [[1634]] explorations. [[Jacques Marquette]] began missionary work with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] near the straits of Mackinac in [[1671]] and moved his congregation to the island after conflicts arose between local Native American tribes. The area, with Mackinac Island in the middle, quickly became an important French fur trading location. The British took control of the straits of Mackinac after the [[French and Indian War]], and Major [[Patrick Sinclair]] chose the bluffs of the island for [[Fort Mackinac]] in [[1780]].<ref name="High Cliffs">{{cite web

===War===
Although the British built Fort Mackinac to protect their settlement from attack by Americans and native tribes, the fort was never attacked during the [[American Revolutionary War]], and the entire straits area was acquired by America through a treaty following the war. During the [[War of 1812]], the British captured the fort in the first battle of the conflict because the Americans had not yet heard that war had been declared. The Americans failed to recapture the island because the British had also built Fort George in the [[high ground]] behind Fort Mackinac. This island was returned to the U.S. in [[1815]], and Fort George was renamed Fort Holmes after Major [[Andrew Holmes|Andrew Hunter Holmes]], an American officer killed in the war.<ref name="High Cliffs"/><ref name="Holmes">{{cite web  | last =Brennan  | first =James  | title =Fort Holmes  | publisher = The Michigan Historical Marker Web Site   | url = http://www.michmarkers.com/startup.asp?startpage=S0078.htm  | accessdate =2007-03-04}}</ref> Fort Mackinac remained under the control of the United States government until 1895 and provided volunteers to defend the Union during the [[American Civil War]]. The fort even served as a prison for three [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] sympathizers.<ref name=".orgHistory"/>

===Early commerce===
[[John Jacob Astor]]'s [[American Fur Company]] was centered on Mackinac Island after the War of 1812 and exported [[beaver]] pelts for the next thirty years. By the middle of the 19th century, [[commercial fishing]], specifically for [[whitefish]] and [[lake trout]], began to replace the fur trade as the island's primary industry. As [[sport fishing]] became more popular in the 1880s, small hotels and restaurants began to be built to accommodate the growing numbers of tourists coming by train from [[Detroit]].<ref name="High Cliffs"/>

===Modern history===
Much of the federal land on Mackinac Island was designated as [[Mackinac National Park]] in [[1875]], just three years after [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]] was designated as the first national park. When the federal government left the island in [[1895]], all of the federal land, including Fort Mackinac was given to the state of Michigan and became Michigan's first state park. Following the Civil War, the island became a popular tourist destination for residents of cities on the Great Lakes. To accommodate the influx of tourists, the boat and railroad companies built hotels, including the Grand Hotel. Souvenir shops began to spring up as a way for island residents to profit from the tourists. Many wealthy [[industrialist]]s built summer [[cottage]]s along the island's bluffs for extended stays. The state park commission appointed to oversee the island has limited private development in the park and requires leaseholders to maintain the island's distinctive Victorian architecture.<ref name="Historic Treasure">{{cite web

==Geology==
Mackinac Island was formed as [[ice age]] [[glaciers]] began to melt around 13000 [[BCE]]. The melting glaciers formed the Great Lakes, and the receding lakewaters eroded the [[limestone]] [[bedrock]], forming the island's steep cliffs and rock formations. As the glaciers completely melted and the lakes receded to near their present levels, Mackinac Island grew to its current size.<ref name="HistplacesPDF"/> The steep cliffs were one of the primary reasons for the British army's choice of the island for a fortification. This is as opposed to the French army's choice of the mainland, at [[Fort Michilimackinac]], near present-day [[Mackinaw City]]. The limestone formations are still part of the island's appeal. However, tourists are attacted by the natural beauty rather than the strategic value. One of the most popular geologic formations is Arch rock, a natural limestone arch, nearly 45&nbsp;meters (150&nbsp;ft) above the ground.<ref name="High Cliffs"/><ref>{{cite web  | title = Arch Rock on Mackinac Island, MI  | publisher = Vacations Made Easy  | url = http://www.vacationsmadeeasy.com/MackinacIslandAreaMI/pointsOfInterest/ArchRockonMackinacIslandMI.cfm  | accessdate =2007-03-11  }}</ref> Other popular geologic formations include [[Sugar Loaf (Mackinac Island)|Sugar Loaf]] and Skull Cave.<ref name="Historic Treasure"/>

==Etymology of "Mackinac"==
As with many other historic places in the Great Lakes region, Mackinac Island has its name rooted in Native American languages. Native Americans in the Straits of Mackinac region likened the shape of the island to that of a [[turtle]]. Therefore, they named it "Mitchimakinak" meaning "big turtle" in the [[Algonquin]] family of languages, which is spoken throughout what is now the northern United States and [[Canada]], and includes [[Menominee language|Menominee]] and Anishinaabe.<ref>{{cite web  | title = Native Languages of the Americas: Algonquian Language Family (Algic, Algonkian Indians)  | work = Native Languages of the Americas website   | url = http://www.native-languages.org/famalg.htm  | accessdate =2007-03-08  }}</ref> The French used a version of the original pronunciation: Michilimackinac. However, the English simplified it to the present name: "Mackinac."<ref>{{cite web

==Historic places==
Because of the island's long history and preservation efforts dating to the 1890s, there are many places on the island recognized by the United States [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The places, along with their historic periods of significance according to the register are:<ref name=".orgHistory"/>
*[[Fort Mackinac]] - 1750-1799, 1800-1824

==Scouting==
Every summer, a minimum of 50 Michigan [[Boy Scout|Boy Scouts]] and [[Girl Scouts]] at any one time,   are living and working on the island in alternating weeks. The program began in [[1929]] when the state park commission invited eight [[eagle scout]]s, including young [[Gerald Ford]], to serve as [[honor guard]]s for the Michigan governor. The program is popular, so only the most well-motivated scouts are accepted into the program. Girl Scouts were first invited to serve in [[1974]]. Scouts perform such duties as raising and lowering all of the flags in the city and in Fort Mackinac. They also serve as guides, answering questions and checking tickets at historic locations around the island. They must complete a service project. Scouts must march when in groups and practice proper stances when at guide posts. "[[Parade rest]]" is used when on duty. In addition, full dress uniform is required when scouts are on duty or walking in public, a much higher standard than is typically enforced for a troop's normal use. During each troop's week on the island, they stay in the Scout Barracks, located north of Fort Mackinac.<ref>{{cite web

===Architecture===
Most of the buildings on Mackinac Island are built from wood, though a few are made of stone, and most have [[clapboard]] siding.<ref name="HistplacesPDF">{{cite web  | title = National Historic Landmark Nomination - Mackinac Island  | publisher = United States Department of the Interior  | url = http://www.mackinacisland.org/html/nationalhistoriclandmark.pdf  | format = [[PDF]]  | accessdate =2007-03-10  }}</ref> The [[architectural styles]] on the island span 300 years of habitation, from the earliest Native American structures to the 19th century. The earliest structures were built by the Anishnaabe, Ojibwe and [[Chippewa]] tribes before European exploration. At least two buildings still exist from the original French settlement in the late 18th century. Mackinac Island is the only example of northern French rustic architecture in the United States and one of few in [[North America]]. Fort Mackinac, with its stone walls instead of the more traditional wood, is a European adaptation of [[Islamic architecture|Islamic military architecture]]. Mackinac Island also contains examples of Federalist, [[colonial house|Colonial]], and [[Greek revival]] styles. Much of the island however, is built in the style of the [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] era which includes [[Gothic Revival]], [[Stick style]], [[Italianate]], [[Second Empire]], [[Romanesque]] and [[Queen Anne style| Queen Anne]] styles. The most recent styles used on the island date from the late 1800s to the 1930s and include the [[Colonial revival]] and [[Tudor revival]] styles.<ref>{{cite web
