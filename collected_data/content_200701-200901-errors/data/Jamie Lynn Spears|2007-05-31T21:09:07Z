====''All That''====
For two seasons, Spears was a cast member on the comedy-variety show ''[[All That]]'' on [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]]. While on ''All That'' she also did many ''On-Air Dare'' (a Nickelodeon version of ''[[Fear Factor]]'') skits where she was doused with 10,000 raw eggs, had to drink human sweat, and eat blue cheese dressing, among other disgusting acts. Another Trademark of hers on ''[[All That]]'' is that she often portrayed a 80 year old security guard who had an unusual obsession with [[bacon]]. She eventually left the ''All That'' in [[2004]] to star in ''[[Zoey 101]]'', another Nickelodeon series.

====''Zoey 101''====
Spears also sings the theme song for ''Zoey 101'', entitled "Follow Me" (which was co-written by her sister, Britney Spears). She stars as one of the first girls to enter a formerly all-boy boarding school. ''Zoey 101'' drew record numbers with the premiere of the show, which gave the channel 1.6 million viewers aged 9-14, its biggest viewership in the demographic for a premiere in eight years. ''Zoey 101'' was nominated for a 2005 [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] for Outstanding Children's Program. In 2006, Spears won a [[Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards]] for Favorite Female TV Star and Favorite TV Female Actress. Also she won a "special award" on the Italian Kids Choice Awards back in December 2006.

====Music====
Though early on Jamie Lynn expressed much interest in having a singing career, as of now she is just sticking to acting and that's what she plans on doing short term. There have been rumors of record deals, but they are unconfirmed. Currently, she can be heard singing the Zoey 101 theme song, her part in the girl group Triple Image's "Hey Now (Girls Just Wanna Have Fun)" (recorded in 2002), and singing karoake in an old E Kara headset commercial.
