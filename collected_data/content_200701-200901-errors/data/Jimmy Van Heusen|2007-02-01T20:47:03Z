'''Jimmy Van Heusen''' ([[January 26]], [[1913]] - [[February 7]], [[1990]]), was an [[United States|American]] [[composer]].  His greatest achievements came in writing songs for the movies and television: over the course of his career, he would win four Oscars and an Emmy.

==Biography==
Christened '''Edward Chester Babcock''' in [[Syracuse, New York]], Van Heusen began recording his songs in the [[1930s]]. In the early [[1940s]], Van Heusen teamed up with [[lyricist]] [[Johnny Burke (lyric writer)|Johnny Burke]] and wrote a number of songs for [[film|movie]]s starring [[Bing Crosby]], including "It's Always You" and "Swinging on a Star".

As well as with Burke, he occasionally collaborated with other lyricists such as [[Johnny Mercer]], with whom he wrote [[I Thought About You]], and [[Eddie DeLange]], with whom he wrote [[Darn That Dream]].

By the [[1950s]] he was working with a new lyricist, [[Sammy Cahn]], and wrote a number of popular songs for television series, including "[[High Hopes (1959 song)|High Hopes]]" in [[1959]].  His songs also were used for a number of major movies, including the [[1949]] version of ''[[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]'', ''[[Rear Window]]'', and the [[1960]] version of ''[[Ocean's Eleven (1960 film)|Ocean's Eleven]]''. Van Heusen wrote a [[musical theater|musical]] in [[1965]] entitled ''[[Skyscraper (musical)|Skyscraper]]''.

Van Heusen and Cahn also wrote songs for [[Frank Sinatra]], frequently being commissioned to write the title songs of his albums - such songs include [[Come Fly With Me]], [[Only The Lonely]] and [[Come Dance With Me]].

Van Heusen also wrote songs under the pseudonym "Arthur Williams", the most significant is "I Could Have Told You". He took the name [[Van Heusen]] from a shirt company.

He was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Song]] 14 times in 12 different years (in both [[1946]] and 1964 he was nominated for two songs), and won 4 times: in [[1944]], [[1957]], [[1959]], and [[1963]]. He won an [[Emmy Award]] for "Best Musical Contribution" in 1956, and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in 1965.

Van Heusen retired in the late 1970s. His songs continue to be used in movies and television series today: ''[[Married... with Children]]'' used his "Love and Marriage" song (lyrics by [[Sammy Cahn]]) for the series theme, and two of his songs were used for the soundtrack of ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)]]''.

He died in [[Rancho Mirage, California]] in 1990 at the age of 77.
