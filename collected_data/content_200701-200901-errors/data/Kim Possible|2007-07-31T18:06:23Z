'''''Kim Possible''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[animated television series]] about a teenage crime fighter who has the task of dealing with worldwide, family, and school issues every day.  The show is fairly action-oriented, but also has a permeating light-hearted atmosphere and often lampoons conventions and clichés of the secret-agent and action genres. 

== Premise ==
[[Kim Possible (character)|Kim]] (voiced by [[Christy Carlson Romano]]) often finds herself crossing the globe in an attempt to rescue people, stop crimes, and battle [[supervillain]]s... all the while being expected to come home and complete her homework in time.  Kim Possible attends [[Middleton (Fictional)|Middleton]] High School, and is captain of the school's [[cheerleading]] squad.  The red-haired crime fighter cannot save the world alone. Assisting her is Wade, a technical genius that she stays in touch with via a her "Kimmunicator" (which has some fantastic abilities of its own), and who rarely shows himself in person. Alongside her is [[Ron Stoppable]], her goofy, wisecracking sidekick (and, later, boyfriend)<!-- Please leave this as is, because Ron isn't the boyfriend until season 4; prior to that, he's merely the sidekick -->, and his scene-stealing pet [[naked mole rat]], [[Rufus (Kim Possible)|Rufus]] (occasionally her friend [[Monique (Kim Possible)|Monique]] helps out and more often than not Kim's troublesome but genius twin brothers [[Jim and Tim Possible]] will come to her aid in some other way).

== Production ==
According to creators [[Mark McCorkle]] and [[Bob Schooley]], they created the show in an elevator.  As they tell it, McCorkle looked at Schooley and said, "Kim Possible: she can do anything".  Schooley at once replied, "Her partner is Ron Stoppable: he can't do anything".  The creators also maintain that it was always their intention for Kim and Ron to eventually become involved romantically, instead of remaining best friends.  This becomes a reality in the supposed series-ending movie, ''[[Kim Possible: So the Drama]]''.  The romantic theme also continues in season four. 

The series premiered on [[Disney Channel]] in June [[2002]], and the first episode to air, ''Crush'', was nominated for a Primetime Emmy award the following year.  With the premiere of this episode, ''Kim Possible'' was regarded as the most watched and highest rated television show on Disney Channel at that time. The series as a whole was nominated for the Daytime equivalent in [[2004]], and again in 2005 (that year saw it receive 5 nominations with 1 win).<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0278866/awards Awards for "Kim Possible"] (2006), retrieved [[August 4]], [[2006]]</ref>.  The show has widely been praised for its smart dialogue, fluid animation, and engaging, well-written characters (both heroic and villainous).

On [[February 22]], [[2005]], after 3 seasons and 65 episodes, the show ended production. Due to the popularity of the series and grassroots operations by dedicated ''KP'' fans, Disney announced on [[November 29]], [[2005]], that the show would be renewed for a fourth season, which debuted on Disney Channel on [[February 10]], [[2007]].

The show's title music, "Call Me, Beep Me", is sung by [[Christina Milian]].  Much of its artistic style is due to character development by artist [[Stephen Silver]].

''Kim Possible'' also airs on [[Toon Disney]] and [[Family Channel]] in Canada. Some early episodes have been aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] as part of it's [[saturday morning]] block [[ABC Kids (United States)|ABC Kids]]. A Mandarin version aired on [[CCTV-12]] in China, and an [[Arabic]] dub was also made which started airing on Dubai TV in early [[2006]] and is currently airing on [[MBC 3]] on the network's "Disney morning timeslot", the only thing that was changed were the character's names, for example Kim was called "''Damo staheel''" (Mostaheel is Arabic for [[Impossible]]), Ron was called "''Mostah aed''", Wade was called "''Awad''", Shego was called "''Shahira''", and Dr. Drakken was called "''Daraken''". The show aired on the French [[Disney Channel]] and then on [[TF1]]'s Disney show in [[France]]. Several changes were made in the names to fit with translated jokes; for example [[Ron Stoppable]] is called Robin Trépide ("Intrépide" meaning some kind of an courageous adventurer). 

''Kim Possible'' is the longest running animated [[List of Disney Channel Original Series|Disney Channel Original Series]] on [[Disney Channel]].

==Characters==
===Team Possible===
[[Image:Kim_Possible_Cast.jpg|thumb|right|300px|From left to right: [[Wade Load|Wade]], [[Dr. James Timothy Possible|Mr.]] and [[Mrs. Dr. Possible|Mrs. Possible]], [[Ron Stoppable|Ron]], [[Rufus (Kim Possible)|Rufus]], [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim]], [[Shego]], [[Doctor Drakken|Dr. Drakken]], [[Monkey Fist]], [[The Seniors|Señor Senior Sr.]], [[Minor villains in Kim Possible#Adrena Lynn|Adrena Lynn]], [[The Seniors|Señor Senior Jr.]]]]
* [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim Possible]] — The team leader, this red-haired crime-fighter who saves the world also tries to live a normal teenage life, dealing with everyday problems.  She has been Ron's best friend since Pre-K, and has been his girlfriend since the night of their junior prom (Season 3).  Naturally, her name makes reference to the word 'impossible.' Kim has faced many different foes and villains throughout her career.  She has dealt with evil weather controlling machines, super fast growing grass and one time even being placed under mind control by her arch foe Doctor Drakken.  Many of her villains also point out the clichés of villainy often saying it's old or classic. Kim's dialogue tends to be peppered with not-so-typical teen [[slang]]; for example, "So not the drama" and "No big", as well as the series' catchphrase, "What's the sitch?" (situation). 
* [[Ron Stoppable]] — Kim's best friend since Pre-K, partner, and now boyfriend; he also saves the world from time to time.  His name is a play on the word 'unstoppable'.
* [[Rufus (Kim Possible)|Rufus]] — Ron's pet [[naked mole rat]], considered a member of the team — in fact, he often proves to be more competent than Ron or even Kim on occasions.(When translated into Latin, Rufus means red-haired.) 
* [[Wade Load|Wade]] — The twelve-year-old super genius (completed high school and college in 8 months) who spends the majority of his time in his room (until the episode "Team Impossible" and soon after that in [[Kim Possible: A Sitch in Time]]).  He runs Kim's website, supplies her with gadgets, assigns her missions, and arranges transportation for her.  His last name is never revealed, though at one point in early development he was known as "Wade Load", perhaps a play on "Wide load", considering his being overweight. 
* [[Monique (Kim Possible)|Monique]] — A close friend of Kim.  Although she has no special abilities, she has helped out on missions a few times.

===Recurring Villains===
* [[Doctor Drakken|Dr. Drakken]] — The blue skinned arch-nemesis of Kim; originally "Drew Lipsky", a college classmate of Kim's father. He is obsessed with [[world domination]], and believing and proving that he is a genius.
* [[Shego]] — Drakken's hired henchwoman. She is arguably Kim's most persistent rival and perhaps even more dangerous than her boss. Her weapon of choice is her green glowing gloved hands which shoot a kind of energy beam. Originally, part of a team of superheroes known as "Team Go".
* [[Monkey Fist]] — A man who is obsessed with the fighting style of Monkey [[Kung-Fu]]. His hands and feet are genetically altered resembling those of monkeys. Wherever he is, his monkey ninjas are sure to follow.

* [[Señor Senior, Sr. and Señor Senior, Jr.|The Seniors]] — Señor Senior, Sr. and Señor Senior, Jr. are foes who are incredibly rich. However, Jr. isn't exactly what Kim and Ron would call "dangerous". He doesn't wish to take over the world like his father wants to, Jr. only wants to be an international pop star.
* [[Professor Dementor]] — A [[mad scientist]]. While he is a threat to Kim and the world, he is more determined to show up his rival, Dr. Drakken.
* [[DNAmy]] — A breeder of living mutants who has a mild fetish for Cuddle Buddies. Her original aim as an evil geneticist is to make real life versions of her Cuddle Buddies, however hers are often much deadlier.
* [[Killer Bebes]] — A group of hiveminded female killer [[robot]]s. They were originally built by Drakken, but have since gone rogue.
* [[Gill (Kim Possible)|Gill]] — The genetically-mutated foe of Ron.
* [[Motor Ed]] — Cousin of Doctor Drakken. Notorious for his mullet haircut, and repetitive use of the word "seriously" at the end of his sentences. Also has a crush on Shego.
