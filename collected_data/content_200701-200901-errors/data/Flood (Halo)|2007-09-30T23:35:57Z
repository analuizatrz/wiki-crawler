The '''Flood''' is a fictional [[parasite|parasitic]] [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] life form in the ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' video game series. They are introduced in ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'' as a secondary enemy to the game's protagonist, [[Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief]], and return in ''[[Halo 2]]''  and ''[[Halo 3]]'' to fill the same role. The Flood are driven by a desire to infest sentient life they encounter, and are depicted as such a threat that the ancient [[Forerunner (Halo)|Forerunner]] were forced to kill themselves and all other sentient life nearly 100,000 years before the beginning of ''Halo'' in an effort to starve the Flood to death.<ref>{{cite web|date=2006-08-01|author=HBO staff|url=http://halosm.bungie.org/story/staten083106.html|title=HBO interview with Staten|work=halo.bungie.org|accessdate=Jan 1|accessyear=2007}}</ref><ref>'''343 Guilty Spark:''' After exhausting every other strategic option, my creators activated the rings.

The player's discovery of the Flood is kept suspenseful and tense, and was one of the surprises reviewers noted positively upon release,<ref name=gamespot>{{cite web|author=Fielder, Joe|date=2001-11-09|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox/action/halo/review.html?page=4|title=Halo: Combat Evolved'' for Xbox Review|work=gamespot.com|accessdate=2007-09-04}}</ref> although others found the Flood too derivative and a clich√©d element of science fiction. [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard Magazine]] rated them the 77th greatest villains of all time.<ref>{{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |month= |title=Top 100 Greatest Villains |journal=Wizard Magazine |volume= |issue= 177|pages= |id= |url= |accessdate= 2007-09-06 |quote= }})</ref>

==Game development==
The Flood were added early in the game development stage of ''Halo: Combat Evolved'', before the game had made its jump from the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] platform and Bungie was bought by [[Microsoft]]; a design for one Flood form appeared as early as 1997.<ref>{{cite book |last= Trautmann|first=Eric|title=The Art of Halo|year= 2004|publisher= Del Ray Publishing|location=New York |isbn=0-345-47586-0 |pages=67}}</ref> At one point, the ringworld ''Halo'' featured dinosaur-like terrestrial creatures, but due to gameplay constraints, these were dropped. An additional consideration was that Bungie felt the presence of other native species would dilute the impact and surprise of the Flood.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bungie.net/News/TopStory.aspx?story=prexboxhistory040904 |title=One Million Years B.X. |author=Bungie|date=2006-02-10 |work=bungie.net|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060210224125/http://www.bungie.net/News/TopStory.aspx?story=prexboxhistory040904 |archivedate=2006-02-10 }}</ref>

Commenting upon the inception of the Flood, Chris Butcher noted that "the idea behind the Flood as the forgotten peril that ended a galaxy-spanning empire is a pretty fundamental tenet of good sci-fi."<ref>{{cite web|date=2002-01-09|url=http://halo.bungie.org/misc/interviews/getinthegame.butcher.010902/|title=Halo Chat with Developer Chris Butcher|work=halo.bungie.org|accessdate=2007-09-03}}</ref>

==Physiology==
[[Image:Flood3.jpg|thumb|right|The "Infection" stage of the Flood.]]
The Flood are depicted as having a complicated lifecycle; smaller base forms of Flood infect and mutate hosts into other forms, which ultimately repeat the cycle by spawning the smaller forms. The largest self-contained form the Flood can produce itself, without using other biomasses,<ref>{{cite book |last= Trautmann|first=Eric|title=The Art of Halo|year= 2004|publisher= Del Ray Publishing|location=New York |isbn=0-345-47586-0 |pages=64}}</ref> is an "Infection form". As its name suggests, the Infection form homes in on hosts, attempting to drive sharp spines into the host and tap into the nervous system. This tap causes the host to be incapacitated, while the Infection form burrows into the host's body and begins the mutation process, bringing the host under Flood control. Hosts that have been recently converted are noted to be weaker than those who have been under Flood control for long periods.<ref>{{cite book |last= Dietz|first= William|title=[[Halo: The Flood]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45921-0 |pages=140}}</ref>

Depending on the size or condition of the host, the Infection form is seen to turn the host into several other forms to serve the Flood's purpose. Suitable hosts are turned into "combat forms", which are described as extremely powerful and resilient warriors, able to resist extreme punishment while utilizing either the weapons of their hosts or the long, whip-like tentacles developed during their mutation to kill any non-Flood in sight.<ref name=h295>{{cite book |author= Piggyback||title=''Halo 2: The Official Strategy Guide: The Flood]''|year= 2004|publisher= Piggyback Interactive Ltd.|location=United States |isbn=0-7615-4473-9|pages=95}}</ref> In the first two games, Combat forms are always mutated Marines or Covenant Elites, recognizable by their respectively thin or bulky appearance, but Brutes can be seen amongst the Combat forms in ''[[Halo 3]]''.  An other form that can be created by the Flood is the "Carrier Form", this form is created if a "Combat Form" is too damaged to prove well in combat ( If the arms/legs are knocked off ect.) The Flood will then morph the combat form into a carrier.  Carrier forms upper halves are bubbley in appearence and carry around infection forms that are developing.
          
The Flood also create forms for tasks other than finding more food. In ''Halo'', the Flood are seen to create "Brain forms"; these spongy creatures, resembling a large bag of flesh with tentacles, can be used to interrogate victims, stripping information from the mind of the host before eventually assimilating them into itself.<ref name=tf200>{{cite book |last= Dietz|first= William|title=[[Halo: The Flood]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45921-0 |pages=200}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Dietz|first= William|title=[[Halo: The Flood]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45921-0 |pages=225}}</ref>

Once the flood begins to acquire enough biomass, they will begin developing a gravemind. A gravemind is a large creature that controls the flood, creating a hive mind scenario. Graveminds are extremely intelligent and resourceful, often times playing their enemies against each other. As a gravemind develops, it is able to exact more control over the lesser flood forms and is eventually able to develop entirely new forms referred to as Pure Forms. Pure forms do not require a host body to create and are instead formed from degraded biomatter. Pure forms are capable of limited shape shifting that allows them to quickly change their role within the flood. 


During the [[Iris (game)|Iris ARG]], the [[Iris_%28game%29#Server_.234|Fourth Server]] postulates that the Flood is of [[Extragalactic astronomy|extragalactic origin]] - that is, not of the [[Milky Way]].

==Appearances==
===''Halo: Combat Evolved''===
The Flood make their surprise appearance more than halfway through ''Halo: Combat Evolved''<nowikI>'</nowiki>s campaign, during the mission "343 Guilty Spark". The [[Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief]] is sent on an extraction mission by Cortana to try and find Captain [[Characters in the Halo series#Jacob Keyes|Jacob Keyes]], who disappeared in a swamp while looking for a weapons cache.<ref>{{cite book |last= Nylund|first= Eric|title=[[Halo: First Strike]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-46781-7 |pages=200}}</ref>

The Master Chief finds that the Covenant have released the Flood accidentally, and the sheer numbers of the parasite overwhelmed Keyes and his squad. While most of the [[United Nations Space Command|UNSC]] Marines were converted to Combat forms, Keyes is interrogated in an attempt by the Flood to learn the location of Earth. Keyes successfully resists,<ref>{{cite book |last= Nylund|first= Eric|title=[[Halo: First Strike]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-46781-7 |pages=199}}</ref> but is assimilated by the Flood before the Master Chief can rescue him. The emergence of the Flood prompts Halo's "Monitor", [[343 Guilty Spark]], to enlist the help of the Master Chief in activating Halo's defenses and preventing a Flood outbreak.<ref>'''343 Guilty Spark''': Greetings. I am the Monitor of installation 04. I am 343 Guilty Spark. Someone has released the Flood. My function is to prevent it from leaving this installation. But I require your assistance. Come. This way. - {{cite video game| title = [[Halo: Combat Evolved]]| developer = Bungie Studios| publisher = Microsoft| date = 2001| platform =[[Xbox]]| version = | level = 343 Guilty Spark| language = English }}</ref> Much of the Flood on Halo are destroyed when the Master Chief, learning of the devastation that Halo would cause if activated, detonates the ''[[United Nations Space Command#Pillar of Autumn|Pillar of Autumn]]''<nowikI>'</nowiki>s engines, destabilizing the ring and preventing the Flood from escaping.

===''Halo Graphic Novel''===
The 2006 one-shot ''[[Halo Graphic Novel]]'' expands upon the Flood's release on Halo in two stories. The first, ''Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor'', takes place early on in the level "343 Guilty Spark" during ''Halo: Combat Evolved''. The Flood manage to pilot a Covenant dropship off Halo, and crash-land the vessel on a Covenant agricultural ship, ''[[Covenant (Halo)#Infinite Succor|Infinite Succor]]''. Successfully assimilating most of the Covenant and wildlife aboard the ship, the Flood are stopped by a Covenant strike team led by [[Characters in the Halo series#Rtas 'Vadumee|Rtas 'Vadumee]], who sets the ship on a course into the nearby sun.<ref>{{cite book |last= Hammock|first= Lee|title=The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor|year= 2006|publisher= Marvel Comics|location=|isbn=0785123725 |pages=}}</ref>

The second story details the escape of Sergeant [[Characters in the Halo series#Avery Johnson|Avery Johnson]] from the clutches of the Flood, immediately after Keyes' squad is overrun during ''Halo''. Due to a pre-existing medical condition called Boren's Syndrome, the Flood parasites cannot infect Johnson. and attempt to kill him instead.<ref>{{cite book |last=Nihei |first= Tsutomu|title=Breaking Quarantine|year= 2006|publisher= Marvel Comics|location=|isbn=0785123725 |pages=}}</ref>

===''Halo 2''===
The Flood returned in ''[[Halo 2]]'', released once again on [[Delta Halo]].<ref>'''Truth''': We are, all of us, gravely concerned. The release of the parasite was unexpected, unfortunate, but there is no need to panic. - {{cite video game| title = [[Halo 2]]| developer = Bungie Studios| publisher = Microsoft| date = 2004| platform =[[Xbox]]| version = | level = Gravemind| language = English }}</ref> The Flood on this ring are led by the [[Gravemind]], a massive creature that dwells in the bowels of the ring. Gravemind rescues both the Master Chief and [[Arbiter (Halo)|the Arbiter]] when they are nearly killed in separate engagements, and sends each in different places in an effort to stop the Covenant from activating the ring.<ref>'''Gravemind''': If you will not hear the truth, then I will show it to you. There is still time to stop the key from turning, but first it must be found. You will search one likely spot... / ...and you will search another. Fate had us meet as foes, but this ring will make us brothers. - {{cite video game| title = [[Halo 2]]| developer = Bungie Studios| publisher = Microsoft| date = 2004| platform =[[Xbox]]| version = | level = Gravemind| language = English }}</ref> In the meantime, Gravemind infests the human ship ''[[United Nations Space Command#In Amber Clad|In Amber Clad]]'' and crashes it into the Covenant space station of [[High Charity]].<ref>'''Cortana''': Flood-controlled dropships are touching down all over the city. That creature beneath the Library, that "Gravemind", used us. We were just a diversion; In Amber Clad was always its intended vector. - {{cite video game| title = [[Halo 2]]| developer = Bungie Studios| publisher = Microsoft| date = 2004| platform =[[Xbox]]| version = | level = High Charity| language = English }}</ref> Once there, the Flood sweep through the city, before Gravemind himself appears and begins questioning the A.I. [[Cortana]].<ref>'''Gravemind''': Silence fills the empty grave, now that I have gone. But my mind is not at rest, for questions linger on. Now ''I'' will ask, and ''you'' will answer. - {{cite video game| title = [[Halo 2]]| developer = Bungie Studios| publisher = Microsoft| date = 2004| platform =[[Xbox]]| version = | level = The Great Journey| language = English }}</ref>

The Flood in this game have some improvements over those in the first. Elite Combat forms can retain their energy shielding (though not always), any Combat form can pilot vehicles, and Infection forms can sacrifice themselves to revive dead Combat forms.

===''Halo 3''===
New Flood forms are encountered in ''Halo 3'', and the previously existing forms now show new abilities. Infection forms are able to convert corpses or even live hosts into new Combat forms in a matter of seconds. While they retain the inarticulate screams that they possessed in ''Halo 2'', the Gravemind taunts the player as they fight in some Flood levels. Brutes are now able to be infected, and are strewn among the Flood troops. Finally, the Carrier forms release more Infection forms than in previous games.

A new, mutable Flood combat form appears in ''Halo 3'', called the "Pure Form." Called Stalker forms, they resemble Covenant Drones at first, being weak in close combat but able to climb up walls. However, it can suddenly transform into a Tank form, a large creature capable of withstanding immense punishment, reminiscent of the scrapped "Drinol" character. It can further mutate into another insect-like form called the Ranged form, which can fire large numbers of spikes, similar to the ammunition from the Covenant Carbine. These creatures are formed when the Flood gain access to large enough stocks of calcium, which it uses to form a framework for biomass collected from other species.

The interior of the Flood-infested High Charity and an infested Covenant ship that crash landed on Earth were subsumed into the Flood, the existing technology largely replaced or covered with biomatter. Examples include large blisters that spawn dozens of Infection forms when damaged and gaping doors resembling organ valves.

==Reception==
While the surprise appearance of the Flood during ''Halo: Combat Evolved'' was seen as an important plot twist, the response to the presence of the Flood in ''Halo 2'' was lukewarm. A panel of reviewers noted that the Flood appeared for no obvious reasons, and were simply described as "aggravating" to play against.<ref name=free>{{cite web|author=Team Freemont|year=2004|url=http://www.teamfremont.com/reviews/Halo2.shtml|title=Team Freemont: Halo 2 review|work=teamfremont.com|accessdate=2007-09-05}}</ref> Similarly, some reviewers felt that the Flood were too derivative of other [[science fiction|sci-fi]] stereotypes, and functioned as "space [[zombie]]s".<ref name=free/><ref>{{cite web|author=Godinez, Victor|date=2006-07-16 |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/ptech/gamereviews2/071806ccdrPTECHhalobook.1d4d3a2.html|title=Review: The Halo Graphic Novel|work=dallasnews.com|accessdate=2007-09-06}}</ref> Lee Hammock, writer of the ''[[Halo Graphic Novel]]'' story ''The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor'', described the basis of the story as a way to showcase the true danger of the Flood as an intelligent menace, rather than something the player happens upon and shoots. Hammock also stated that the story would prove the intelligent nature of the Flood, and "hopefully [[euthanization|euthanize]] the idea that they are just space zombies";<ref>{{cite book |last= Hammock|first= Lee|title=The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor|year= 2006|publisher= Marvel Comics|location=|isbn=0785123725 |pages=}}</ref> this treatment was received positively by critics.<ref>{{cite web|author=Scrofani|date=2006-07-16|url=http://www.gzpro.org/gameofthemonth.htm|title=Game Zone Pro: ''Halo Graphic Novel''|work=gzpro.org|accessdate=2007-09-06}}</ref>
