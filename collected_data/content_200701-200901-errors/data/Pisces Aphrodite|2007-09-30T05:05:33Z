{{nihongo|Pisces Aphrodite|魚座のアフロディーテ|Pisukesu no Ahurodiite}} is a [[fictional character]] from long-time manga-ka [[Masami Kurumada]]'s [[anime]] and [[manga]] series, ''[[Saint Seiya]]''.

== Personality and background==
Gemini Saga once claimed that Aphrodite was the most beautiful among all the Saints. He was named after the [[Aphrodite|greek Goddess of love and beauty]] to reflect on this. However, Aphrodite never claimed to be the most beautiful creature. Unlike the Silver Saint, [[Lizard Misty]] who said that "even the stars in the sky will loose their luster compared to him". It is important to note that despite his feminine appearance, Aphrodite is not narcissistic. He is often seen as cruel as his fellow Gold Saint, [[Cancer Deathmask]], but not as sadistic.<br>
Aphrodite is depicted as a man who believes the power is the only way to keep the order and assure the justice. Base on this, he believes the stronger is allowed to rule over the weaks.<br>
He is also very ironic and sarcastic. According to Saga, despite his beauty, Aphrodite is the most feared of all the 88 Athena Saint. This was confirmed in [[Saint Seiya Episode G]] when Aphrodite appeared in front of the Titan's soldiers who were not only in awe due to his beauty but also paralyzed by fear in his presence.<br>
A recurring motife about him is that he sees the victory as the biggest beauty of all and, therefore, he believes what makes him really beautiful would not be his face, but his absolute power.<br>
Many thought Aprodite might really be a girl because of his name which is named after the Greek goddess of beauty and love. In the French and Chinese versions of the TV series, he is voiced by a female actress.<br>
His name is probably a reference on the legend about the [[constellation]] of [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]]. In this legend [[Aphrodite]] and her son [[Eros]] transformed into fishes in order to escape the monstrous [[Typhon]].<br>

== Plot overview ==
===The Sanctuary saga===
[[Image:Saint-Aphrodite-manga.jpg|thumb|right|Aphrodite, in a panel from the manga in vol.12. Drawing by the author Masami Kurumada]]
As guardian of the final Temple of Sanctuary, Pisces Aphrodite faces the last two Bronze Saints remaining: [[Pegasus Seiya]] and [[Andromeda Shun]]. Shun stated that he would hold Aphrodite off, while Seiya manages to pass through the temple. Aphrodite laughs and tells Shun that even if Seiya passes through the temple, between it and the Pope's hall, he has a garden of Royal Demon Roses, and because Seiya has to pass through them, he would eventually lose his senses and die. As the two fought, Aphrodite revealed that he was the Gold Saint who attacked Andromeda Island and killed Shun's master, Cepheus Daidalos. Knowing about this, the normally kind and pacifist Shun was enraged and vowed to defeat Aphrodite.

Using his ''Rolling Defense'', Shun managed to repell of all Aphrodite's ''Royal Demon Rose'' attack. However, when Aphrodite used his ''Pirahna Rose'' on Shun, his Nebula Chains and Bronze Cloth were shattered. Although he seemed to be defenseless, Shun remembered that his master, Cepheus Daidalos, mentioned that he had an extremely powerful cosmo in him, normally restrained by the Andromeda Cloth. This power could only be awakened when he is without his Cloth. Using the power of his hidden cosmos, Shun discovered a new attack: ''Nebula Storm'', which he used to pin down Aphrodite.  However, being merciful in nature, Shun gave Aphrodite a chance to repent, but Aphrodite shows no intention to do so, and prepared his strongest attack, the ''Bloody Rose''. Shun was forced to counter with his final attack "Nebula Storm" and ended up killing Aphrodite, but not without being struck in the center of his heart by the Bloody Rose, falling into near-death conditions. The Bloody Rose was true to its name as it was draining all the blood from Shun's heart. It was not until the start of the Asgard/Poseidon arc that he managed to recover.

===The Hades===
[[Image:hades_pisces_face.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Given by Hades, new dark version of the Pisces Cloth as he appears in the anime]]
The deceased Gold Saints were revived as Spectres by the power of Hades, and, lead by the Spectre of former Pope, [[Aries Shion]], they were sent to Sanctuary to assassinate Athena. In the first Temple, Shion was stopped by [[Aries Mu]]. Shion orders [[Cancer Deathmask]] and [[Pisces Aphrodite]] to defeat Mu so they could continue their mission. However, neither Gold Saint was able to break Mu's Crystal Wall until Shion does so himself. Deathmasks beats Mu around for a moment until Seiya arrives and interferes, but Mu tells Seiya that he is not needed for this battle, and banishes him with his ''Starlight Extinction''. Pleased with what Mu has done, Deathmask and Aphrodite attempts to pass the temple, but Mu tells them that he would kill any enemy who dares to cross the Aries Temple. Mu quickly banishes Deathmask and Aphrodite with his ''Starlight Extinction''.

Back in Hades' castle, [[Wyvern Rhadamanthys]], one of the 3 Judges of Hell, punishes the two for failing their mission and casts them back into the abyss to hell.

Later on, it was revealed that Deathmask and Aphrodite were secretly on Athena's side, along with the rest of the deceased Gold Saints, and were asked by Shion to pretend to follow Hades' order (in the Anime, after Shion asked all the dead Gold and Silver Saints to pretend to follow Hades' order, Aphrodite smiled and Deathmask grinned widely. Shion then thanked all of them for carrying the burden of the traitor's branding in pretending to betray Athena).

In the final gathering of the 12 Gold Saints at the Wall of Sighs, Aphrodite's spirit and the Gold Cloth of Pisces appeared to help open the gateway to Elysion, where Hades' true body lies. After this, his spirit and cosmo disappeared, and all that was evident of him was the Pisces Gold Cloth which remained.

===Episode G===
[[Saint Seiya Episode G]] shows us Aphrodite seven years before the original happenings of the story. Already a Gold Saint, Aphrodite is depicted as a centered and merciless person able to kill his opponents even if they are humans. Aphrodite is also depicted as thinking about beauty in fights and calling victory the greatest beauty that crowns the strongest warrior. His participation, until now, was very short. After the Titans gate being discovered on , he was sent by the Pope of the Sanctuary to cover the entry of the Chronos' Labyrinth with his deadly roses.

Since [[Leo Aiolia]] rushed into the Titans' world before, the Pope's plans were ruined. Even so, Aphrodite saved a defenseless Aiolia from the attacks of the Titans' followers. After some argument between the two Gold Saints (since Aiolia was against Aphrodite bloodlust), the Gigas Anthrakma Zugilos appeared. Aphrodite saved himself and Aiolia from Zugilos' deadly mace (that could destroy anything alive with its vibrations) and then killed the Gigas. After that, he traveled back to the Sanctuary and left behind a carpet of vines and white roses protecting the exit of that world (to avoid an invasion against the Sanctuary).

In Episode G, Aphrodite is shown as a narcissistic person. This could be explained due to the fact he is seven years younger than in the original timeline.

==Power and abilities==
Having mastered the 7th sense, Aphrodite is fully capable of using the plenty of his Cosmo energy. This allows him to move and attack at the speed of light. As every saint, he also possess some degree of psychic power that allows him to use abilities like telekinesis and telepathy (both implied, since he was never showed using any of those). At the end of the Hades' saga, it is hinted that Aphrodite was able to use the 8th sense as well, allowing his soul to move freely on the underworld so he could help the other Gold Saints.<br>
[[Saint Seiya Lost Canvas]] explains that the Pisces Saints are immune to poisons due to the fact they live close to the garden of royal demon roses after the Pisces Temple. The manga also explains that the immense beauty of the Pisces Saints have an important function: it mesmerizes the enemies during fights.<br>
[[Image:aphrodite_epiG.jpg|thumb|200px|In Episode G, Aphrodite is shown controlling vines in different ways: to refrain a giant's movements (top), as giant blades (bottom left) and as a protective cocoon (bottom right).]]
Even so, Aphrodite's main power remains on his ability to manipulate his Cosmo energy in order to create different kinds of roses that he can freely manipulate. Using this ability, he can do the following techniques:
*{{nihongo|Royal Demon Rose|ロイヤルデモンローズ|roiyaru demon rōzu}}:  Aphrodite uses red roses as a projectile. When struck by the thorns on the roses or smelling their fragrance, the target would be poisoned until they slowly lost their 5 [[senses]] and fell into a sweet aroma of death. The red roses can also creat a dense red mist to cover the entire place and hide his position.
*{{nihongo|Piranha Rose|ピラニアンローズ|piranian rōzu}}: Aphrodite uses black roses as a projectile. Upon impact, they would break anything in their touch. The power of this technique is high enough to reduce to dust a bronze armor recently strengthned by [[Aries Mu]].
*{{nihongo|Bloody Rose|ブラッディローズ |buradi rōzu}}: Aphrodite uses one or more white roses as a projectile. It would strike at the opponent's chest, and drain all the blood from their heart. As the white rose draws blood, it eventually becomes red. This is Aphrodite's strongest attack. A single rose is enough to kill a giant of many feet of height in few seconds. Apparently, the rose seeks the heart of the enemy, so is not possible to avoid it. The only way to not be hit by it is destroying the rose or having a defensive technique strong enough.<br>
As shown in [[Saint Seiya Episode G]], Aphrodite is also able to create and manipulate large rose's vines. So far, he used them to refrain and strangle his targets, create massive vine blades and to create deffensive cocoons to protect and heal his or another person's body (through his Cosmo energy).<br>

==Pisces Albafica==
In the [[Saint Seiya Lost Canvas|The Lost Canvas manga]], {{nihongo|Albafica|アルバフィカ|Arubafika}} is the name of the Pisces Saint living in the 18th Century.<br />
Keeper of the 12th Temple, protecting it with poisonous roses, has developed an immunity to poisons so high his own blood became poisonous. Due to this, he is not only able to use the same techniques as Aphrodite (Royal Demon Rose, Piranian Rose and Bloody Rose), he can also manipulate his blood with the technique {{nihongo|Crimson Thorn|クリムゾンソーン|kurimuzon sōn}} to create a liquid rose that will shower through his enemy's body, poisoning them - this technique was used to kill the Specter Deep Niobe of the Terrestrial Darkness Star. Unlike Aphrodite's, Albafica's poison (used in both Royal Demon Rose and Crimson Thorn) kills the enemy by causing [[hemorrhage|internal hemorrhage]] and is not painless. Apparently, he is not able to control rose's vines.<br />
He was defeated once by Griffin Minos of the Celestial Nobility Star's Cosmic Marionation attack during in fronte of the Sanctuary, presumably dead. But he returned alive after that when Minos was attacking the Rodorio village. Then, he proceeds to defeat Minos with a [[Suicide attack|suicidal attack]].<br>

The name ''Albafica'' may come from the Greek word, ''Alba'', that means "white", and ''Ficus'' the same as the plant, that has the meaning of a "group of plants".
