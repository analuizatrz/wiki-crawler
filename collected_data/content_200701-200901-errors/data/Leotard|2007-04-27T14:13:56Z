A '''leotard''' is a [[skin-tight]] one-piece garment that covers the torso and body but leaves the legs free. It was made famous by the French acrobatic performer [[Jules Léotard]] ([[1839]]–[[1870]]), about whom the song "[[The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze]]" was written.

Leotards are worn by [[acrobatics|acrobats]], [[gymnast]]s, [[dancer]]s and [[circus (performing art)|circus]] performers both as practice garments and performance [[costume]]s. They are often worn together with [[tights]]. There are sleeveless, short-sleeved and long-sleeved leotards. A variation is the [[unitard]], which also covers the legs.

Leotards are entered through the neck. (Contrast with [[bodysuit]]s, which generally have [[snap fastener|snaps]] at the crotch, allowing the garment to be pulled on over the head.) Scoop-necked leotards have wide neck openings and are held in place by the elasticity of the garment. Others are [[crew neck|crew-necked]] or [[Polo neck|turtle-necked]] and close at the back of the neck with a [[zipper]] or snaps.

==History==

The first known use of the name ''leotard'' came only in 1886, many years after Léotard's death. Léotard himself called the garment a ''maillot'', which in French has now come to mean a [[swimsuit]].  In the early [[20th century]], leotards were mainly confined to [[circus]] and [[acrobatic]] shows, worn by the specialists who performed these acts.

The 1920s and 1930s saw leotards influencing the style of [[bathing suit]]s, with women's bathing suits today similar in appearance to leotards. Leotards were also worn by professional dancers such as the [[showgirl]]s of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Stage use of the leotard typically coordinated the garmet with [[stockings]] or tights beginning the trend to wear legwear with a leotard.

The 1950s saw leotards first used in public [[physical fitness]], with the first "exercise leotards" typically uni-colored worn with thick tights. Between 1950 and 1970, leotards remained as such in appearance until a style change in the 70s resulted in more colorful leotards appearing on the scene, most often in ballet and exercise.  Traditional leotard outfits continued to be worn by stage performers and circus actors.

The 1980s saw an explosion of leotards with the fashion craze of [[aerobics]]. Between 1980 and 1988, thousands of women joined [[health club]]s all sporting leotards and tights. The leotards of the time were a variety of [[nylon]] and [[spandex]], mixed in with the more traditional cotton uni-colored leotards and tights, and frequently with a thong back. The major leotard company [[Danskin]] flourished during this period.

==Modern usage==
Leotards as an exercise fashion took a downfall in the 1990s, being replaced by more comfortable exercise garments such as biking shorts and [[crop top]]s. Today the use of leotards and tights in fitness and exercise has all but vanished but the garment can still be found in traditional ballet, on the stages of musical productions, and in gymnastics.

Leotards and tights are often worn by young children in such activities as dance, exercise, and ballet. They are commonly worn in the sport of gymnastics, usually a sleeveless leotard in practice and a long sleeved one in competitions. Leotards can also be worn as [[lingerie]] and are eroticised by some people, often as part of a wider [[spandex fetishism]].
