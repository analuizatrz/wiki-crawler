The '''Battle of the Gebora''' ([[19 February]] [[1811]]) was a minor battle between [[Spain|Spanish]] and [[France|French]] armies near [[Badajoz]],  Spain, during the [[Peninsular War]].  An outnumbered French force routed and practically destroyed the Spanish Army of [[Extremadura]].

A French army, under the command of [[Nicolas Jean de Dieu Soult|Marshal Soult]] had been [[siege|besieging]] the Spanish fortress town of [[Badajoz]] since [[27 January]] [[1811]].  A large Spanish army, commanded by General Gabriel Mendizabal and supported by a small force of Portuguese cavalry, marched to relieve the siege, and camped on the nearby heights of San Cristóbal in early February of that year.  Soult, whose army had been weakened during an arduous campaign in Extremadura, launched a surprise attack against the Spaniards, and after a short battle caused 1,000 casualties and took 4,000 prisoners at a cost of only 400 French losses.  Having destroyed the Spanish army, Soult eventually captured Badajoz on [[11 March]] [[1811]].

== Background ==

Following the victory at the [[Battle of Bussaco]], [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Sir Arthur Wellesley, Viscount of Wellington]] was forced, by [[André Masséna|Marshal Masséna]]'s manoeuvring, to retreat behind the [[Lines of Torres Vedras]].  By [[10 October]] [[1810]], only the British [[Craufurd's Light Division|light division]] and some [[cavalry]] patrols remained outside the defensive Lines.<ref name="Weller141-142">{{harvnb|Weller|1962|pp=141&ndash;142}}.</ref>  Masséna's Army of Portugal concentrated around [[Sobral de Monte Agraço|Sobral]], seemingly preparing to attack the Lines.  After a fierce [[skirmisher|skirmish]] on [[14 October]], the French dug themselves in rather than launch a full-scale assault.  They remained entrenched for a month before withdrawing to a position between [[Santarém, Portugal|Santarém]] and [[Rio Maior]].<ref name="Weller145-146">{{harvnb|Weller|1962|pp=145&ndash;146}}.</ref>

[[Image:Soult2.jpg|left|thumb|Nicolas Soult]]
Meanwhile, [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] sent dispatches to [[Nicolas Jean de Dieu Soult|Marshal Soult]], commander of the Army of Andalusia, urging him to send assistance to Masséna.<ref name="Gates245">{{harvnb|Gates|1986|p=245}}.</ref>  The Emperor's orders, however, were based on outdated intelligence; by the time Soult received them, the situation had changed considerably.<ref name="Oman28-29">{{harvnb|Oman|1911|pp=28&ndash;29}}.</ref>  Soult could not launch an attack against [[Lisbon]]&mdash;there were 30,000 Allied troops and six major [[fortification|fortresses]] between his army and the Portuguese capital&mdash;but he felt obliged to do something.<ref name="Gates245"/>  Soult therefore gathered an army of 20,000 men, mainly from V&nbsp;[[Corps]], and launched an expedition into [[Extremadura]] with the aim of capturing the fortress at [[Badajoz]] and drawing some of the Allied forces away from the Lines of Torres Vedras.<ref name="Glover142">{{harvnb|Glover|1974|p=142}}.</ref>

Soult split his army into two equal columns and advanced into Extremadura, via the two main passes from [[Andalusia]] into the [[Guadiana]] valley, with the intention of rejoining at [[Almendralejo]].<ref name="Oman31-32">{{harvnb|Oman|1911|pp=31&ndash;32}}.</ref>  One of the columns, commanded by General Marie-Charles Latour-Maubourg, met little resistance on its march; on [[3 January]], the column was confronted by 2,500 Spanish and Portuguese cavalry near [[Usagre]], but that force was only a screen covering the retreat beyond the Guadiana of a Spanish [[infantry]] division commanded by General Gabriel Mendizabal.  Latour-Maubourg was therefore able to take position near Almendralejo and await the arrival of the second French column.<ref name="Oman32">{{harvnb|Oman|1911|p=32}}.</ref>  

That column, commanded by Soult and including [[Honoré Théodore Maxime Gazan de la Peyrière|General Honoré Gazan's]] V&nbsp;Corps [[division (military)|division]], was escorting the French siege-train and therefore had to take a longer, more practicable, route into Extremadura.<ref name="Oman32"/>  Because of bad weather and the desertion of the Spanish drivers, the [[artillery]] train became separated from the escorting infantry and, when the column was threatened by 5,000 Spanish troops under General Francisco Ballesteros, Soult ordered [[Édouard Adolphe Casimir Joseph Mortier|Marshal Mortier]] to see off the Spaniards.  Ballesteros retreated from the French without serious harm, but since he was still in a position to threaten the rear of the French column, Soult left Gazan's infantry to head off the Spanish force and protect the delayed siege-train, and continued on to Almendralejo with his cavalry.<ref>{{harvtxt|Oman|1911|p=33}} and {{harvtxt|Napier|1831|p=91}}.</ref>  As a result, Soult finally joined Latour-Maubourg on [[6 January]] with only a fraction of his original column and no heavy artillery.<ref name="Oman32"/>

== Prelude to battle ==

[[Image:Romana.PNG|thumb|Lieutenant-General Caro y Sureda, 3rd marqués de La Romana]]
Soult could not [[siege|besiege]] so strong a [[fortification|fortress]] as Badajoz with his reduced force and therefore changed his plans.  Sending his [[light cavalry]], under General Briche, to take [[Mérida, Spain|Mérida]] and leaving four [[squadron]]s of [[dragoon]]s at [[La Albuera|Albuera]] to watch the garrison at Badajoz, he marched with the remainder of his army to [[investment (military)|invest]] [[Olivenza]].<ref name="Oman35">{{harvnb|Oman|1911|p=35}}.</ref>  Wellington had previously advised [[Pedro Caro y Sureda, 3rd marqués de La Romana|General Pedro Caro de La Romana]], commander of the Spanish Army of Extremadura, to either destroy the fortification at Olivenza, or to repair its defences and fully garrison it;  La Romana had instructed Mendizabal to [[slighting|slight]] the fortress, but Mendizabal ignored this order and instead reinforced the garrison with four infantry [[battalion]]s.<ref>{{harvtxt|Napier|1831|p=92}} and {{harvtxt|Oman|1911|p=35}}.</ref>  Soult, arriving on [[11 January]], was therefore confronted with an untenable fortress with a strong garrison.  The heavy French artillery finally began to arrive on [[19 January]], and by [[22 January]] a poorly repaired breach in the fortress's walls had been reopened.  The garrison surrendered on [[23 January]], with over 4,000 Spanish troops from the Army of Extremadura taken captive.<ref name="Oman36-37">{{harvnb|Oman|1911|pp=36&ndash;37}}.</ref>

Soult was now in an unenviable position;  he had to release two [[battalion]]s to escort the prisoners taken at Olivenza back to French-held [[Seville]], leaving him only 5,500 infantry and a large (4,000 strong) contingent of cavalry with which to continue his campaign.  Although his siege-train had started to arrive, the continued absence of Gazan's infantry division left him with a weakened army;  despite this, though, he determined to lay siege to Badajoz in a bid to tempt Wellington into weakening the Allied army facing Masséna at the Lines of Torres Vedras by sending a contingent to relieve the Spanish fortress.<ref>{{harvnb|Oman|1911|pp=37&ndash;38}}.</ref>  On [[26 January]] he set forth to Badajoz, while sending Latour-Maubourg with six cavalry battalions across the Guadiana to blockade the fortress's northern approach,<ref>{{harvnb|Oman|1911|p=38}}.</ref> and by [[27 January]] the [[First Siege of Badajoz (1811)|first siege of Badajoz]] had begun.<ref name="Gates245"/>

Meanwhile, Mendizabal had sent two battalions into Badajoz to increase its garrison, and retreated to the Portuguese border.<ref name="Oman40">{{harvnb|Oman|1911|p=40}}.</ref>  Weakened by the loss of the garrison at Olivenza and Ballesteros's continued absence, he sent to La Romana for reinforcements; on [[14 January]], 1,800 men under Carlos de España were sent from [[Abrantes]].  Additionally, about 6,000 troops were sent forward from the Lines of Torres Vedras on [[19 January]], arriving at [[Elvas]] on [[29 January]].  When these forces joined with Mendizabal's remaining 3,000 men, a Spanish cavalry division and a Portuguese cavalry brigade, the Allies had an army almost 15,000 strong, under the command of La Romana, with which to hold Soult in check.<ref>{{harvtxt|Napier|1831|p=92}} and {{harvtxt|Oman|1911|pp=43&ndash;44}}.</ref>  Before leaving [[Lisbon]], La Romana had agreed a plan for the campaign with Wellington&mdash;the army was to entrench on the heights of San Cristóbal with its right flank protected by the fort of San Cristóbal, the front covered by the Gebora and Guadiana rivers, the left guarded by the fortress at [[Campo Maior]] and Elvas protecting the rear.<ref>{{harvtxt|Napier|1810|p=93}} and {{harvtxt|Oman|1911|p=47}}, from Wellington's dispatches.</ref>  La Romana, however, died of an [[aneurysm]] on [[23 January]], and command of the army fell to Mendizabal.<ref>{{harvtxt|Oman|1911|pp=44&ndash;46}}, {{harvtxt|Esdaile|2002|loc=p. 337 footnote}} and {{harvtxt|Gates|1986|p=248}}.</ref>

Although aware of the agreed plan, upon arriving on the north bank of the Guadiana on [[5 February]],<ref name="Esdaile337">{{harvnb|Esdaile|2002|p=337}}.</ref> Mendizabel chose to ignore it; instead, he threw the bulk of his infantry into Badajoz, leaving only a small contingent of foot and his cavalry below San Cristóbal.<ref>{{harvtxt|Napier|1831|p=94}} and {{harvtxt|Oman|1911|p=47}}.</ref>  On [[7 February]], Mendizabal launched a strong sally against the besieging French lines.  The Portuguese cavalry, supported by a small group of infantrymen, feinted towards the French left wing while a strong force of 5,000 men attacked the right.  The Spaniards under de España drove through the first French parallel and engaged one of [[Jean-Baptiste Girard (soldier)|General Girard's]] brigades and were only driven back when Mortier sent several battalions to Girard's aid.  De España pulled back to Badajoz, having lost 650 men and causing 400 French casualties.<ref>{{harvtxt|Oman|1911|p=48}} and {{harvtxt|Napier|1831|p=96}}.</ref>

On [[9 February]], Mendizabal pulled most of his men out of Badajoz, leaving a garrison of 7,000 men.  The [[field army]]'s 9,000 infantry settled on the heights of San Cristóbal, while the 3,000 horse encamped behind them, on the plains of the Caya.  Again, the Spanish commander ignored Wellington's plan, and failed to dig entrenchments on the heights; nor did he send out a cavalry screen to protect his front and monitor the French movements.<ref>{{harvnb|Oman|1911|p=49}}.</ref>  Soult, however, largely ignored the Spanish army for the next few days, concentrating instead on building up his siege lines and battering Badajoz.<ref>{{harvnb|Oman|1911|p=50}}.</ref>  Heavy rains also caused both the Guadiana and Gebora rivers to burst their banks and they couldn't be crossed, so between 11&ndash;18 February the French were only able to [[shell (projectile)|shell]] the southern end of the Spanish [[line (formation)|line]] with the aim of pushing the Spaniards further away from Badajoz and the protection of the San Cristóbal fort.<ref name="floods">{{harvtxt|Napier|1831|p=97}} and {{harvtxt|Oman|1911|pp=50&ndash;51}}.</ref>

== Battle ==

[[Image:Gebora and 1 Badajoz.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Map of the battle]]
By the afternoon of [[18 February]] the rains had abated and the water levels in the Guadiana and Gebora rivers;  the Gebora was once more fordable.<ref name="floods"/>  In the evening of that day, Soult sent nine infantry battalions, three cavalry squadrons and two [[artillery battery|artillery batteries]], under Mortier's command, across a flying bridge over the Guadiana to the north bank.  Joined by six cavalry regiments under Latour-Maubourg, the French now had 4,500 infantrymen, 2,500 horse and 12 cannon ready to attack the Spanish lines at dawn on [[19 February]].<ref name="battle1">{{harvtxt|Gates|1986|p=248}}, {{harvtxt|Oman|1911|p=51}} and {{harvtxt|Napier|1831|p=97}}.</ref>  Thanks to heavy fog, the first Mendizabal knew of the approaching French was when his picket, a mile to his front, was driven back by Mortier's infantry fording the Gebora.<ref>{{harvnb|Oman|1911|p=51}}.</ref>  At the same time, Latour-Maubourg had sent the 2nd [[Hussar]]s to the north to turn the Spanish left flank;  that cavalry had been able to climb the heights undetected and fell upon one of Carlos de España's unsuspecting regiments.<ref>{{harvtxt|Napier|1831|pp=97&ndash;98}} and {{harvtxt|Oman|1911|pp=51&ndash;52}}.</ref>

Mortier showed his tactical abilities when deploying his small force:  he sent all his cavalry to the north to attack the Spanish left, while three battalions were sent south between the fort at San Cristóbal and the Spanish right wing and his remaining six infantry battalions attacked the Spanish front.<ref>{{harvtxt|Oman|1911|p=52}} and {{harvtxt|Napier|1831|p=98}}.</ref>  As the fog rose, the French light cavalry, under Briche, gained the heights and attacked the Spanish left flank while Latour-Maubourg took three [[dragoon]] regiments to attack the combined Spanish and Portuguese cavalry on the plains of the Caya.<ref>{{harvnb|Oman|1911|pp=52&ndash;53}}.</ref>  Despite outnumbering the French, the Allied cavalry ignored their orders and immediately fled towards Elvas and Campo Maior; they escaped unscathed, since Latour-Maubourg chose to leave them alone and instead attacked the Spanish infantry line.<ref name="Oman53">{{harvnb|Oman|1911|p=53}}.</ref>

[[Image:Mortier, Edouard.jpg|thumb|right|Édouard Mortier, duc de Trévise]]
The fight at the Spanish left flank was not, at first, so clear-cut.  Since the fog had lifted, the Spaniards could see just how weak the opposing force was and formed up with little sign of falling.<ref name="Oman53"/>  The [[musket|musketry]] duel between the two sides had scarcely begun, however, when the French cavalry appeared;  the light horse approached along the top of the heights, while Latour-Maubourg's dragoons came up from the rear.  Mendizabal formed his troops into two huge divisional [[infantry square|squares]], supported by his artillery,<ref>{{harvtxt|Gates|1986|p=248}} and {{harvtxt|Oman|1911|p=53}}.</ref> and initially the French cavalry were unable to break through.<ref name="Esdaile337"/>  Mendizabal's two massive squares, however, were an easy target for the French infantry and artillery&mdash;as one Spanish infantryman recounts, "their artillery played upon it in a most horrible fashion until it became first an oval and then an unformed mass that the cavalry were able to penetrate and take prisoner".<ref name="Esdaile337"/>  Briche's light cavalry thus broke through the two Spanish squares without much difficulty, and the battle was effectively over.  Some of the Spanish regiments dispersed, many surrendered, and some clubbed together to fight their way to Badajoz or the Portuguese border.<ref name="Oman54">{{harvnb|Oman|1911|p=54}}.</ref>

== Consequences ==

The battle was a disaster for the Anglo&ndash;Spanish&ndash;Portuguese allies;  the Army of Extremadura had been practically destroyed.  2,500 infantry escaped into Badajoz, and a slightly smaller number to Portugal, but about 1000 Spaniards had been killed or wounded, 17 cannon lost and 4,000 taken prisoner.<ref name="consequences">{{harvtxt|Gates|1986|p=248}} and {{harvtxt|Oman|1911|pp=54&ndash;55}}.</ref>  The French, for their part, suffered slight casualties.  Soult initially gave his losses at 30 killed and 140 wounded, but those figures were eventually revised to around 400 casualties, mainly from the cavalry.<ref name="consequences"/>

Soult was now free to continue his investment of Badajoz;  although the town's garrison was now some 8,000 strong thanks to the influx from Mendizabal's destroyed army, it eventually fell to French hands on [[11 March]].<ref>{{harvnb|Oman|1911|loc=p. 55 and pp. 57&ndash;61}}.</ref>
