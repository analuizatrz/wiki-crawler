His first commercial was at age six. He attended [[The Mall School]], a small private school in [[Twickenham]] and as a schoolboy, performed in plays, including in the role of [[Willy Wonka]] in a production ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]''.  He then went on to attend [[Lambrook Haileybury]] school in [[Berkshire]] and played numerous main parts in school and year plays.

In 2005, Pettyfer, after ending his modelling career,<ref name="nytimes" /> made his professional acting debut in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[television]] production of ''[[Tom Brown's Schooldays]]'', playing the lead character, [[Tom Brown (character)|Tom Brown]]; he received positive reviews for the role.<ref name="wales">{{cite web|url=http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/0900entertainment/0050artsnews/tm_objectid=17426152&method=full&siteid=50082&headline=going-down-a-storm-name_page.html|title=ICWales.co.uk|work=Going down a storm|accessdate=2006-07-20}}</ref> In June 2005, he was cast in his most prominent role so far, that of teenage [[MI6]] spy [[Alex Rider]] in the film ''Stormbreaker'', based on the novel by [[Anthony Horowitz]]. He was one of 500 who auditioned for the role.<ref name="scotsman" /> Pettyfer chose to appear in the film over a role in the film ''[[Eragon (film)|Eragon]]'', noting that he preferred ''Stormbreaker'' because it would be filmed in Britain, in the [[Isle of Man]], while ''Eragon'' would film in the [[Czech Republic]]; Pettyfer is afraid of flying, and he liked the looks of the cast for ''Stormbreaker''.<ref name="nytimes" /> ''Stormbreaker'' was released on 21 July 2006 in the [[United Kingdom]], on 6 October 2006 in the [[United States]] and on 21 September 2006 in [[Australia]].
