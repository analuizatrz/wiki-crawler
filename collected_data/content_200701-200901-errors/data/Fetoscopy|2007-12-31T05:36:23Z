'''Fetoscopy''' is an endoscopic procedure during [[pregnancy]] to allow access to the [[fetus]], the [[amniotic cavity]], the [[umbilical cord]], and the fetal side of the [[placenta]]. A small (3-4 mm) incision is made in the abdomen, and the [[endoscope]] is inserted through the wall of the abdomen and [[uterus]] into the amniotic cavity. Fetoscopy allows interventions such as a [[biopsy]] or [[laser]] occlusion of abnormal vessels.
