'''''The Giver''''' is a [[book]] written by [[Lois Lowry]].  It is set in a future society which is at first presented as a [[utopian society]] and gradually appears more and more [[dystopia]]n; therefore, it could be considered ''anti-utopian''. The novel follows a boy named Jonas through the twelfth year of his life. The society has eliminated pain and strife by converting to "Sameness", a plan which has also eradicated [[emotion]]al depth from their lives. Jonas is selected to inherit the position of "Receiver of Memory," the person who stores all the memories of the time before Sameness, in case they are ever needed to aid in decisions that others lack the experience to make.  As Jonas receives the memories from the previous receiver—the "Giver"—he discovers how shallow his community's life has become.

Despite good controversy and criticism that the book's subject material is inappropriate for young children, ''The Giver'' won the 1994 [[Newbery Medal]] and has sold more than 5.3 million copies. In Australia, the [[Education in the United States|United States]] and Canada it is a part of many [[middle school]] reading lists, but it is also on many banned book lists. The novel forms [[The Giver Trilogy|a loose trilogy]] with ''[[Gathering Blue]]'' (2000) and ''[[Messenger (novel)|Messenger]]'' (2004), two other books set in the same future era.

== Plot summary ==

The book's setting seems to be a [[utopia]], where all possible steps are taken to eliminate pain. The people are almost always compliant; families share their dreams and feelings on a daily basis to
diffuse emotional buildup. This society remains harmonious by matching up husbands and wives based on compatibility of personality and if there is any sign of feelings the match is denied. There is also a subtle theme of [[technology]] having only a minimal role in [[society]]; throughout the book, it is taken for granted that Jonas's community is without such technologies as [[television]], or [[radio]], although [[computer]]s are mentioned at one point. Transportation is mostly limited to [[bicycle]]s; however, [[automobile|cars]] and [[airplane]]s exist in small numbers. 
  
Lowry describes creating the pain-free world of [[Jonas (The Giver)|Jonas']] Community in her [[Newbery Medal|Newbery Award]] speech:	 
<blockquote>
I tried to make Jonas's world seem familiar, comfortable, and safe, and I tried to seduce the reader. I seduced myself along the way. It did feel good, that world. I got rid of all the things I fear and dislike; all the [[violence]], [[poverty]], [[prejudice]] and [[injustice]], and I even threw in good manners as a way of life because I liked the idea of it.<br/>One child has pointed out, in a letter, that the people in Jonas's world didn't even have to do dishes.<br/>It was very, very tempting to leave it at that.<ref>from Lowry's "Newbery Award" acceptance speech</ref>  
</blockquote>

As time progresses in the novel, however, it becomes clear that the society has lost contact with the ideas of [[family]] and [[love]], at least in the "more complete" sense at which Lowry hints. Children are born to designated "Birthmothers" and then family units can apply for children. If the family unit applies for the maximum allowed number of two, it will always be one boy and one girl. This is to keep the genders even. After family units have served the purpose of raising the children in a stable environment, they cease to exist, the parents going to a communal housing facility for childless adults, and the children becoming involved in their work and starting monogenerational families of their own, forgetting their foster parents who are growing old. The community maintains this process using pills which suppress [[emotion]]s, mainly romantic [[love]] and [[human sexuality|sexuality]], which they refer to as "Stirrings."

All the land near the Community and around the other, similar communities clustered about the nearby river has been flattened to aid [[agriculture]] and [[transportation]]. A vaguely described system of [[climate control]] is used so that the weather remains constant. It is implied that [[genetic engineering]] has been used extensively to manipulate human beings so that they physically conform with Sameness, there is no real life exsistence. 

The Community is run by a Council of Elders that assigns each 12-year-old the job he or she will perform for the rest of his or her life. People are bound by an extensive set of rules touching every aspect of life, which if violated would require a simple but somewhat ceremonious apology. In some cases, violating the rules is "winked at": older siblings invariably teach their younger brothers and sisters how to ride a [[bicycle]] before the children are officially permitted to learn the skill. If a member of the community has committed serious infractions three times before, he or she may be punished by "release". "Release" is a thing at which the characters hint throughout the book. Originally, it is thought of as a process where the "released" is sent to live outside of the community, but still in a good place. Eventually, it is revealed to be a system of [[euthanasia]] through [[lethal injection]], employed not only as punishment, but also to ensure a monotony of means by which [[death]] occurs.

The book is told from a [[Third person limited omniscient|third-person limited]] point of view. The [[protagonist]], [[Jonas]], is followed as he awaits the Ceremony of Twelve. Jonas lives in a standard family unit with his mother (a judge) and father (a "Nurturer"). He is selected to be "Receiver of [[Memory]]", because of his unusual "Capacity to See-Beyond", which is an ability to do something unusual, such as [[colorblindness|see color]], which all the other people were genetically changed not to see, or hear [[music]] (as in the case of Jonas's mentor). He trains for the position of Receiver by receiving memories from the aged incumbent, known to the community as "The Receiver", and to Jonas as "The Giver", who is burdened by the emotional weight of the memories.  These memories are images from the world as it existed before the time called Sameness, "back and back and back", things that no one else in Jonas's world remembers. 

Through the Giver, who becomes his teacher and surrogate grandfather, Jonas telepathically receives memories of things eliminated from his world: [[violence]], [[sadness]], and loss, as well as true [[love]], [[beauty]], [[joy]], [[adventure]], [[animals]], and [[family]]. Having knowledge of these complex and powerful concepts alienates Jonas from his friends and family, as well as making him more cynical towards his previously sheltered life, as he often discusses with the Giver. Eventually, these revelations prompt Jonas to seek to change the community and return emotion and meaning to the world. He and the Giver plan on doing this by having Jonas leave the community, which would cause all of the memories he was given to be released to the rest of the people, allowing them to feel the powerful emotions that Jonas and the Giver feel.

Meanwhile, Jonas's family temporarily houses a baby named [[Gabriel]], because he is unable to sleep throughout the night and disturbs the other babies in the "Nurturing Center". Jonas learns that unlike the other people in his community, "Gabe" can receive memories from Jonas, which he uses to help calm the baby. Because Gabriel still cannot sleep through the night without crying after the extra year he was given to learn how to sleep soundly, he is now destined to be Released. Desperate, Jonas flees the community with Gabe. At first, the escape seems successful. Soon, however, food runs out and they grow weak. They find a snow covered hill with a sled on top, which Jonas remembers from the first memory he ever Received. He and Gabriel board the sled and go down the hill where they hear singing.

The ending is ambiguous, and Jonas's future and even survival are left unresolved. Their survival is made apparent, however, in ''[[Messenger (novel)|Messenger]],'' a sequel novel written much later.



==Literary significance and criticism==
The critical reception of Lowry's work has been polarized.  On one hand, one finds critics like [[Anita Silvey]], whose ''100 Best Books for Children'' calls ''The Giver'' one of the 1990s' greatest [[science fiction]] novels for children and young adults.<ref>[http://www.anitasilvey.com Anita Silvey], ''100 Best Books for Children'', page 147 (Houghton Mifflin, 2004).  ISBN 0-618-27889-3. </ref><ref> [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0618618775&id=O3xytWMrGxMC&pg=PA147&lpg=PA147&ots=FoLRSlDJHW&dq=%22The+Giver%22+inauthor:anita+inauthor:silvey&sig=UhyZINfYEO5iZZxKK4AWn0kAqzI] Google Books view of original quote</ref>  A review in the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' says, "Lowry's powerful book, simply and directly written, offers an inspiring defense of freedom. Both adventurous and skillfully plotted, this book is recommended for young readers 8 and up."<ref>"A Monitor's Guide to Children's Bestsellers", ''Christian Science Monitor'' [[24 September]] [[1998]] p. B12.</ref>

''The Giver'' has become something of a [[canonical]] work among educators who believe that young adult audiences respond best to contemporary literature{{Fact|date=July 2008}}. These teachers postulate that "teenagers need a separate body of literature written to speak directly to the adolescent experience [...] and plots that revolve around realistic, contemporary topics". (Of course, Lowry's futuristic setting means that this ''particular'' young adult book can only address "contemporary topics" in an [[allegory|allegorical]] fashion, a point which raises questions of its own.) In this view, a "classics-only" curriculum can stunt a developing reader's appetite for words; there are naturally teachers who argue the opposite side of the argument, and press to keep older works on the reading lists.<ref>Marie C. Franklin, "CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: Debate continues over merit of young-adult fare", ''[http://www.bostonglobe.com Boston Globe]'' [[23 February]] [[1997]] p. G1.</ref>

Lowry's novel has also found a home in "City Reads" programs, library-sponsored reading clubs on city-wide or larger scales. [[Waukesha County, Wisconsin]] and [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin]] chose to read ''The Giver,'' for example, as did [[Middletown, Connecticut]]; [[Bloomington, Illinois]]; [[Valparaiso, Indiana]]; [[Rochester, Minnesota]]; [[Central Valley, New York]]; [[Centre County, Pennsylvania]]; [[Montgomery County, Maryland]] and others.<ref>"[http://www.loc.gov/loc/cfbook/one-book.html 'One Book' Reading Promotion Projects]", form the [[Library of Congress]]'s Center for the Book</ref><ref>Judith Rosen, "Many Cities, Many Picks", ''Publishers Weekly'' [[10 March]] [[2003]] p. 19.</ref>

Some adult reviewers writing for adults have commented that the story is not likely to stand up to the sort of probing literary criticism used in "serious" circles. For instance, 50 children are born each year by the group of "birthmothers" who each have 3 children — therefore 17 new "birthmothers" are required each year, even though this profession is looked down upon in the book. Karen Ray, writing in the ''New York Times,'' detects "occasional logical lapses", but quickly adds that the book "is sure to keep older children reading. And thinking".<ref>Karen Ray, "Children's Books", ''New York Times'' [[31 October]] 1993.</ref> [[Young adult fiction]] author [[Debra Doyle]] was more critical stating that "Personal taste aside, The Giver fails the sf Plausibility Test", and that "Things are the way they are (in the novel) because The Author is Making A Point; things work out the way they do because The Author's Point Requires It.".<ref>[http://www.sff.net/people/doylemacdonald/ya-riff.htp], Debra Doyle, ''SFF Net'', accessed July 1, 2008</ref>

Natalie Babbitt of the ''Washington Post'' was more forgiving, calling Lowry's work "a warning in narrative form", saying:

<blockquote>
The story has been told before in a variety of forms—[[Ray Bradbury]]'s ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' comes to mind—but not, to my knowledge, for children. It's well worth telling, especially by a writer of Lowry's great skill. If it is exceedingly fragile—if, in other words, some situations don't survive that well-known [[suspension of disbelief]]—well, so be it. ''The Giver'' has things to say that can't be said too often, and I hope there will be many, many young people who will be willing to listen.<ref>Natalie Babbitt, "The Hidden Cost of Contentment", ''Washington Post'' [[9 May]] 1993, p. X15.</ref>
</blockquote>

==Adaptations==
Oregon Children's Theatre (Portland, Oregon) premiered a stage adaptation of "The Giver" by [[Eric Coble]] in March 2006 to critical acclaim.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.wweek.com/calendar/3218/performance/ | title = Willamette Week | accessdate = 2008-04-18}}</ref> Subsequent productions of Coble's one-hour script have been presented by The Coterie Theatre (Missouri), First Stage (Wisconsin), People's Light and Theatre (Pennsylvania), Theatre of Youth (New York), and Stages Repertory (Texas), and others throughout the U.S.. 

In the fall of 1994, actor [[Bill Cosby]] and his ASIS Productions film company established an agreement with Lancit Media Productions to adapt ''The Giver'' to film. In the years following, members of the partnership changed and the production team grew in size, but little motion was seen toward making the film. At one point, screenwriter Ed Neumeier was signed to create the screenplay. Later, Neumeier was replaced by [[Todd Alcott]]<ref>[http://www.thezreview.co.uk/comingsoon/g/giverthe.htm Article on the film adaptation]</ref> and [[Walden Media]] became the central production company.<ref>"Jeff Bridges and Lancit Media to co-produce No. 1 best seller 'THE GIVER' as feature film", ''Entertainment Editors'' [[28 September]] [[1994]].</ref><ref>Ian Mohr, "Walden gives 'Giver' to Neumeier", ''[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com Hollywood Reporter]'' [[10 July]] 2003.</ref>

An [[Internet Movie Database]] entry for ''The Giver'' appeared in late 2004, which claimed a release date in 2007.  Bridges himself is, at present, the only credited cast member to be listed. ''The Giver'' is currently in pre-production and is slated for release in 2011. It is to be directed by [[David Yates]]. Actor [[Ron Rifkin]] read the text for the [[audio book]] edition.
