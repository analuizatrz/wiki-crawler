'''Hangul''' ({{pronEng|ˈhɑːŋɡʊl}}, or Korean {{Audio-IPA|KO-Hangul.ogg|[hanɡɯl]}}) is the native [[alphabet]] of the [[Korean language]], as distinguished from the [[logogram|logographic]] [[Sino-Korean]] [[hanja]] system.  It is the official [[writing system|script]] of [[North Korea]], [[South Korea]] and the [[Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture]] of [[China]].

Hangul is a [[Phonemic orthography|phonemic]] alphabet organized into [[syllable|syllabic]] blocks. Each block consists of at least two of the 24 Hangul letters ''([[#Jamo|jamo]])'', with at least one each of the 14 [[consonant]]s and 10 [[vowel]]s. These syllabic blocks can be written horizontally from left to right as well as vertically from top to bottom, columns from right to left. Originally, the alphabet had several additional letters ''(see [[#Obsolete jamo|obsolete jamo]])''. For a phonological description of the letters, see ''[[Korean language#Phonology|Korean phonology]]''.

===Official names===
* The modern name ''Hangul'' ({{lang|ko-Hang|한글}}) is a term coined by [[Ju Sigyeong]] in [[1912]] that simultaneously means "great({{lang|ko-Hang|한}}) script({{lang|ko-Hang|글}})" in archaic Korean and "Korean script" in modern Korean. It is not [[sino-Korean]] and therefore has no corresponding [[Hanja]]. {{lang|ko-Hang|한글}} is pronounced {{IPA|/hangɯl/}} and would be [[romanize]]d in one of the following ways:
** '''Hangeul''' or ''Han-geul'' in the [[Revised Romanization of Korean]], which the [[South Korea]]n government uses in all English publications and encourages for all purposes. Many recent publications have adopted this spelling.
** '''Han'gŭl''' in the older [[McCune-Reischauer]] system. When used as an English word, it is rendered without the [[diacritic]]s: ''Hangul,'' or sometimes without capitalization: ''hangul''. This is how it appears in many English dictionaries.
** '''Hankul''' in [[Yale Romanization]], another common system in English dictionaries.
* [[North Korea]]ns prefer to call it ''Chosŏn'gŭl'' ({{lang|ko-Hang-KP|조선글}}), for reasons related to the different [[names of Korea]].
* The original name was ''Hunmin Jeong-eum'' (훈민정음; 訓民正音; see ''[[#History|history]]).'' Due to objections to the names ''Hangeul,'' ''Chosŏn'gŭl,'' and ''Urigeul'' (우리글) (see below) by the Korean minority in [[Manchuria]], the otherwise uncommon short form '''Jeongeum''' may be used as a neutral name in some international contexts.

===Other names===
Until the early twentieth century, Hangul was denigrated as vulgar by the literate elite who preferred the traditional Hanja writing system. They gave it such names as:
* ''Eonmun'' (언문 {{lang|ko-Hant|諺文}} "vernacular script"). 
* ''Amkeul'' (암클 "women's script"). 암 is a prefix that signifies a noun is feminine (수 is its counterpart).
* ''Ahaekkeul'' or ''ahaegeul'' (아햇글 or 아해글 "children's script").
* ''Achimgeul'' (아침글"writing you can learn within a morning")<ref>Choi Seung-un; [http://www.paregabia.com/data/photo_hangul/hangul_exposants.pdf Structures et particularités de la langue coréenne]</ref>.

However, these names are now archaic, as the use of hanja in writing has become very rare in South Korea and completely phased out in North Korea. Today, the name ''Urigeul / Urigŭl'' (우리글) or "our script" is used in both North and South Korea in addition to ''Hangeul / Han'gŭl''.

==History==
[[Image:Hunmin jeong-eum.jpg|thumb|212px|left|A page from the ''Hunmin Jeong-eum''. The Hangul-only column, fourth from left, (<span style="font-family: 은 자모 바탕, UnJamoBatang, Code2000">나랏말ᄊᆞ미</span>), has pitch-accent diacritics to the left of the syllable blocks.]]
{{Alphabet}}
Hangul was promulgated by the fourth king of the [[Joseon Dynasty]], [[Sejong the Great]]. The [[Hall of Worthies]] is often credited for the work, but records show that his staff of scholars denounced the king for not having consulted with them. King Sejong may have worked in secret, possibly with other members of the royal family, because of the opposition by the educated elite. 

The project was completed in late 1443 or early 1444, and published in 1446 in a document titled ''[[Hunmin Jeongeum]]'' ("The Proper Sounds for the Education of the People"), after which the alphabet itself was named. The publication date of the ''Hunmin Jeong-eum,'' October 9, became [[Hangul Day]] in [[South Korea]]. Its [[North Korea]]n equivalent is on January 15.

Various speculations about the creation process was put to rest by the discovery in 1940 of the 1446 ''[[Hunmin Jeongeum Haerye|Hunmin Jeong-eum Haerye]]'' ("''Hunmin Jeong-eum'' Explanation and Examples"). This document explains the design of the consonant letters according to [[articulatory phonetics]] and the vowel letters according to the principles of [[yin and yang|''yin'' and ''yang'']] and [[vowel harmony]].

King Sejong explained that he created the new script because the Korean language was different from Chinese; using Chinese characters (known as [[Hanja]]) to write was so difficult for the common people that only the male aristocrats ''([[yangban]])'' could read and write fluently. (A few female members of the royal family could also do so to a certain extent). The majority of Koreans were effectively illiterate before Hangul's invention. 

Hangul was designed so that even a commoner could learn to read and write; the ''Haerye'' says "A wise man can acquaint himself with them before the morning is over; a stupid man can learn them in the space of ten days."<ref>''[[Hunmin Jeongeum Haerye]]'', postface of [[Jeong Inji]], p. 27a, translation from [[Gari K. Ledyard]], ''The Korean Language Reform of 1446'', p. 258</ref> 

Hangul faced heavy opposition by the literate elite, such as [[Choe Manri]] and other [[Confucian]] scholars in the 1440s, who believed hanja to be the only legitimate writing system. Later rulers too became hostile to Hangul. [[Yeonsangun of Joseon|Yeonsangun]], the 10th king, forbade the study or use of Hangul and banned Hangul documents in 1504, and [[Jungjong of Joseon|King Jungjong]] abolished the Ministry of ''Eonmun'' in 1506. Even before these official actions, Hangul had been principally used by women and the undereducated.

The 16th century saw a revival of Hangul, with [[gasa]] literature and later [[sijo]] flourishing. In the 17th century, Hangul novels became a major genre. <ref> http://enc.daum.net/dic100/viewContents.do?&m=all&articleID=b24h2804b Korea Britannica article</ref> 

Due to growing [[Korean nationalism]] in the 19th century, Japan's attempt to sever Korea from China's [[sphere of influence]], and the [[Gabo Reform]]ists' push, Hangul was eventually adopted in official documents for the first time in 1894. Elementary school texts began using Hangul in 1895, and the ''[[Dongnip Sinmun]]'', established in 1896, was one of the first newspapers printed exclusively in Hangul.<ref> http://enc.daum.net/dic100/viewContents.do?&m=all&articleID=b24h2804b </ref>

After Korea was [[Korea under Japanese rule|annexed by Japan]] in 1910, Hangul was initially taught in Japanese-established schools,<ref> [http://www.um.u-tokyo.ac.jp/umdb/newspaper1000/jpeg-s/01902.jpg Picture] of [[Dong-a Ilbo]] (동아일보)</ref> and Korean was written in a mixed Hanja-Hangul script, where most lexical roots were written in Hanja and grammatical forms in Hangul. However, the Korean language was banned from schools in 1938 as part of a policy of [[cultural assimilation]],<ref> http://enc.daum.net/dic100/viewContents.do?&m=all&articleID=b24h2804b </ref> and all Korean-language publications were outlawed in 1941.<ref>http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/krtoc.html, under The Media</ref>

Hangul orthography was standardized by an academic group led by [[Ju Sigyeong]] in publications such as the ''[[:wikisource:ko:한글 마춤법 통일안|Standardized System of Hangul]]'' in [[1933]], and a system for transliterating foreign orthographies was published in 1940. 

Since regaining independence from Japan in 1945, the Koreas have used Hangul or mixed Hangul as their sole official writing system, with ever-decreasing use of hanja. Since the 1950s, it has become uncommon to find hanja in commercial or unofficial writing in the South, with some South Korean newspaper only using hanja as abbreviations or disambiguation of homonyms. There has been widespread debate as to the future of Hanja in South Korea, 
<!-- The following paragraph came without references from Wikibooks [[Korean/Alphabet]]. Anyone can confirm this? -->and the number of characters taught in schools has fallen from ? in 1956 to 1,800 in the 1990s. North Korea reinstated Hangul as its exclusive writing system in 1949, and banned the use of Hanja completely.

==''Jamo''==
{{see also|Hangul consonant and vowel tables}}
'''''Jamo''''' (자모; [[Hanja|字母]]) or ''natsori'' (낱소리) are the units that make up the Hangul alphabet.  '''''Ja''''' means letter or character, and '''''mo''''' means mother, so the name suggests that the ''jamo'' are the building-blocks of the script.

There are 51 ''jamo,'' of which 24 are equivalent to [[letter]]s of the [[Latin alphabet]].  The other 27 ''jamo'' are clusters of two or sometimes three of these letters.  Of the 24 simple ''jamo,'' fourteen are [[consonant]]s ''(ja-eum'' 자음, 子音 "child sounds") and ten are [[vowel]]s ''(mo-eum'' 모음, 母音 "mother sounds"). Five of the simple consonant letters are doubled to form the five "tense" ([[faucalized voice|faucalized]]) consonants (see below), while another eleven clusters are formed of two different consonant letters.  The ten vowel ''jamo'' can be combined to form eleven [[diphthong]]s.  Here is a summary:

* 14 simple [[consonant]] letters: ㄱ, ㄴ, ㄷ, ㄹ, ㅁ, ㅂ, ㅅ, ㅇ, ㅈ, ㅊ, ㅋ, ㅌ, ㅍ, ㅎ, plus obsolete ㅿ ([[alveolar]]), ㆁ ([[Velar consonant|velar]]), ㆆ, ㅱ, ㅸ, ㆄ
*  5 double letters (glotalized): ㄲ, ㄸ, ㅃ, ㅆ, ㅉ, plus obsolete ㅥ, ㆀ, ㆅ, ㅹ
* 11 [[consonant cluster]]s: ㄳ, ㄵ, ㄶ, ㄺ, ㄻ, ㄼ, ㄽ, ㄾ, ㄿ, ㅀ, ㅄ, plus obsolete ㅦ, ㅧ, ㅨ, ㅪ, ㅬ, ㅭ, ㅮ, ㅯ, ㅰ, ㅲ, ㅳ, ㅶ, ㅷ, ㅺ, ㅻ, ㅼ, ㅽ, ㅾ, ㆂ, ㆃ and obsolete triple clusters ㅩ, ㅫ, ㅴ, ㅵ

* 6 simple [[vowel]] letters: ㅏ, ㅓ, ㅗ, ㅜ, ㅡ, ㅣ, plus obsolete ㆍ
* 4 simple [[iotation|iotized]] vowel letters (semi consonant-semi vowel): ㅑ, ㅕ, ㅛ, ㅠ
* 11 [[diphthong]]s: ㅐ, ㅒ, ㅔ, ㅖ, ㅘ, ㅙ, ㅚ, ㅝ, ㅞ, ㅟ, ㅢ, plus obsolete ㆎ, ㆇ, ㆈ, ㆉ, ㆊ, ㆋ, ㆌ

Four of the simple vowel ''jamo'' are derived by means of a short stroke to signify iotation (a preceding ''i'' sound): ㅑ ''ya,'' ㅕ ''yeo,'' ㅛ ''yo,'' and ㅠ ''yu.'' These four are counted as part of the 24 simple ''jamo'' because the iotating stroke taken out of context does not represent ''y''. In fact, there is no separate ''jamo'' for ''y''.

Of the simple consonants, ㅊ ''chieut,'' ㅋ ''kieuk,'' ㅌ ''tieut,'' and ㅍ ''pieup'' are [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] derivatives of ㅈ ''jieut,'' ㄱ ''giyeok,'' ㄷ ''digeut,'' and ㅂ ''bieup,'' respectively, formed by combining the unaspirated letters with an extra stroke.

The doubled letters are ㄲ ''ssang-giyeok'' (kk: ''ssang-'' 쌍 "double"), ㄸ ''ssang-digeut'' (tt), ㅃ ''ssang-bieup'' (pp), ㅆ ''ssang-siot'' (ss), and ㅉ ''ssang-jieut'' (jj). Double ''jamo'' do not represent [[geminate]] consonants, but rather a "tense" [[phonation]]. 

===''Jamo'' design===
Hangul is a [[Featural alphabet|featural]] script. Scripts may transcribe languages at the level of [[morpheme]]s ([[logogram|logographic scripts]] like ''[[hanja]]),'' of [[syllable]]s (syllabic scripts like ''[[kana]]),'' or of [[segment (linguistics)|segment]]s ([[alphabet]]ic scripts like the one you're reading here). Hangul goes one step further, using distinct strokes to indicate [[distinctive feature]]s such as [[place of articulation]] ([[labial consonant|labial]], [[coronal consonant|coronal]], [[velar consonant|velar]], or [[glottal consonant|glottal]]) and [[manner of articulation]] ([[plosive]], [[nasal consonant|nasal]], [[sibilant consonant|sibilant]], [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]]) for consonants, and iotation (a preceding ''i-'' sound), [[Vowel harmony|harmonic class]], and [[I-mutation]] for vowels. 

For instance, the consonant ''jamo'' ㅌ ''t'' {{IPA|[tʰ]}} is composed of three strokes, each one meaningful: the top stroke indicates ㅌ is a plosive, like ㆆ ''’,'' ㄱ ''g,'' ㄷ ''d,'' ㅂ ''b,'' ㅈ ''j,'' which have the same stroke (the last is an [[Affricate consonant|affricate]], a plosive-fricative sequence); the middle stroke indicates that ㅌ is aspirated, like ㅎ ''h,'' ㅋ ''k,'' ㅍ ''p,'' ㅊ ''ch,'' which also have this stroke; and the curved bottom stroke indicates that ㅌ is coronal, like ㄴ ''n,'' ㄷ ''d,'' and ㄹ ''l.'' Two consonants, ㆁ and ㅱ, have dual pronunciations, and appear to be composed of two elements, stacked one over the other, to represent these two pronunciations: {{IPA|[ŋ]}}/silence for ㆁ and {{IPA|[m]}}/{{IPA|[w]}} for obsolete ㅱ.

With vowel ''jamo,'' a short stroke connected to the main line of the letter indicates that this is one of the vowels which ''can'' be iotated; this stroke is then doubled when the vowel ''is'' iotated. The position of the stroke indicates which harmonic class the vowel belongs to, [[yin and yang|"light"]] (top or right) or [[yin and yang|"dark"]] (bottom or left). In modern ''jamo,'' an additional vertical stroke indicates [[i-mutation]], deriving ㅐ {{IPA|[ɛ]}}, ㅔ {{IPA|[e]}}, ㅚ {{IPA|[ø]}}, and ㅟ {{IPA|[y]}} from ㅏ {{IPA|[a]}}, ㅓ {{IPA|[ʌ]}}, ㅗ {{IPA|[o]}}, and ㅜ {{IPA|[u]}}. However, this is not part of the intentional design of the script, but rather a natural development from what were originally [[diphthong]]s ending in the vowel ㅣ {{IPA|[i]}}. Indeed, in many [[Dialects of Korean|Korean dialects]]{{Fact|date=July 2007}}, including the standard [[Seoul Dialect|dialect of Seoul]], some of these may still be diphthongs. 

Although the design of the script may be featural, for all practical purposes it behaves as an alphabet. The ''jamo'' ㅌ isn't read as three letters ''coronal plosive aspirated,'' for instance, but as a single consonant ''t.'' Likewise, the former diphthong ㅔ is read as a single vowel ''e.'' 

Beside the ''jamo,'' Hangul originally employed [[diacritic mark]]s to indicate [[pitch accent]]. A syllable with a high pitch (거성) was marked with a dot (<span style="font-family: 은 자모 바탕, UnJamoBatang, Code2000, serif">ᅟ〮</span>) to the left of it (when writing vertically); a syllable with a rising pitch (상성) was marked with a double dot, like a colon (<span style="font-family: 은 자모 바탕, UnJamoBatang, Code2000, serif">ᅟ〯</span>). These are no longer used. Although [[vowel length]] was and still is phonemic in Korean, it was never indicated in Hangul, except that syllables with rising pitch (<span style="font-family: 은 자모 바탕, UnJamoBatang, Code2000, serif">ᅟ〯</span>) necessarily had long vowels. 

Although some aspects of Hangul reflect a shared history with the [[Phagspa script]], and thus [[Brahmic family|Indic]] [[phonology]], such as the relationships among the [[wiktionary:homorganic|homorganic]] ''jamo'' and the [[alphabet|alphabetic principle]] itself, other aspects such as organization of ''jamo'' into syllablic blocks, and which Phagspa letters were chosen to be basic to the system, reflect the influence of Chinese writing and phonology. 

====Consonant ''jamo'' design====
The letters for the consonants fall into five [[wiktionary:homorganic|homorganic]] groups, each with a basic shape, and one or more letters derived from this shape by means of additional strokes. In the ''Hunmin Jeong-eum Haerye'' account, the basic shapes iconically represent the articulations the [[tongue]], [[palate]], [[teeth]], and [[throat]] take when making these sounds.

The Korean names for the groups are taken from Chinese [[phonetics]]:

*[[Velar consonant]]s (아음, 牙音 ''a-eum'' "molar sounds")
** ㄱ ''g'' {{IPA|[k]}}, ㅋ ''k'' {{IPA|[kʰ]}}
** Basic shape: ㄱ is a side view of the back of the tongue raised toward the velum (soft palate). (For illustration, access the external link below.) ㅋ is derived from ㄱ with a stroke for the burst of aspiration. 
*[[Coronal consonant]]s (설음, 舌音 ''seol-eum'' "lingual sounds"): 
** ㄴ ''n'' {{IPA|[n]}}, ㄷ ''d'' {{IPA|[t]}}, ㅌ ''t'' {{IPA|[tʰ]}}, ㄹ ''r'' {{IPA|[ɾ, l]}}
** Basic shape: ㄴ is a side view of the tip of the tongue raised toward the [[alveolar ridge]] (gum ridge). The letters derived from ㄴ are pronounced with the same basic articulation. The line topping ㄷ represents firm contact with the roof of the mouth. The middle stroke of ㅌ represents the burst of aspiration. The top of ㄹ represents a [[flap consonant|flap]] of the tongue. 
*[[Bilabial consonant]]s (순음, 唇音 ''sun-eum'' "labial sounds"): 
** ㅁ ''m'' {{IPA|[m]}}, ㅂ ''b'' {{IPA|[p]}}, ㅍ ''p'' {{IPA|[pʰ]}}
** Basic shape: ㅁ represents the outline of the lips in contact with each other. The top of ㅂ represents the release burst of the ''b''. The top stroke of ㅍ is for the burst of aspiration.
*[[Sibilant consonant]]s (치음, 齒音 ''chieum'' "dental sounds"):
** ㅅ s {{IPA|[s]}}, ㅈ j {{IPA|[tɕ]}}, ㅊ ch {{IPA|[tɕʰ]}}
** Basic shape: ㅅ was originally shaped like a wedge ʌ, without the [[serif]] on top. It represents a side view of the teeth. The line topping ㅈ represents firm contact with the roof of the mouth. The stroke topping ㅊ represents an additional burst of aspiration. 
*[[Glottal consonant]]s (후음, 喉音 ''hueum'' "throat sounds"): 
** ㅇ ''ng'' {{IPA|[ʔ, ŋ]}}, ㅎ ''h'' {{IPA|[h]}}
** Basic shape: ㅇ is an outline of the throat. Originally ㅇ was two letters, a simple circle for silence (null consonant), and a circle topped by a vertical line, ㆁ, for the nasal ''ng''. A now obsolete letter, ㆆ, represented a [[glottal stop]], which is pronounced in the throat and had closure represented by the top line, like ㄱㄷㅈ. Derived from ㆆ is ㅎ, in which the extra stroke represents a burst of aspiration.

The phonetic theory inherent in the derivation of glottal stop ㆆ and aspirate ㅎ from the null ㅇ may be more accurate than Chinese phonetics or modern [[IPA]] usage. In Chinese theory and in the IPA, the glottal consonants are posited as having a specific "glottal" place of articulation. However, recent phonetic theory has come to view the glottal stop and [h] to be isolated features of 'stop' and 'aspiration' without an inherent place of articulation, just as their Hangul representations based on the null symbol assume.

====Vowel ''jamo'' design====
Vowel letters are based on three elements: 
* A horizontal line representing the flat Earth, the essence of ''[[yin and yang|yin]]''.
* A point for the Sun in the heavens, the essence of ''[[yin and yang|yang]]''. (This becomes a short stroke when written with a brush.)
* A vertical line for the upright Human, the neutral mediator between the Heaven and Earth.

Short strokes (dots in the earliest documents) were added to these three basic elements to derive the simple vowel ''jamo:'' 
* Simple vowels
** Horizontal letters: these are mid-high back vowels.
*** light ㅗ ''o''
*** dark ㅜ ''u''
*** dark ㅡ ''eu'' (''ŭ'')
** Vertical letters: these were once low or front vowels. (ㅓ&nbsp;''eo'' has since migrated to the back of the mouth.)
*** light ㅏ ''a''
*** dark ㅓ ''eo'' (''ŏ'')
*** neutral ㅣ ''i''
* Compound ''jamo''. Hangul never had a ''w'', except for [[Sino-Korean]] [[etymology]]. Since an ''o'' or ''u'' before an ''a'' or ''eo'' became a {{IPA|[w]}} sound, and {{IPA|[w]}} occurred nowhere else, {{IPA|[w]}} could always be analyzed as a [[phoneme|phonemic]] ''o'' or ''u,'' and no letter for {{IPA|[w]}} was needed. However, vowel harmony is observed: ''yin'' ㅜ&nbsp;<small>''u''</small> with ''yin'' ㅓ&nbsp;''eo'' for ㅝ ''wo;'' ''yang'' ㅏ&nbsp;''a'' with ''yang'' ㅗ&nbsp;''o'' for ㅘ ''wa:'' 
** ㅘ&nbsp;<small>''wa''</small> = ㅗ&nbsp;<small>''o''</small> + ㅏ&nbsp;<small>''a''</small>
** ㅝ&nbsp;<small>''wo''</small> = ㅜ&nbsp;<small>''u''</small> + ㅓ&nbsp;<small>''eo''</small>
** ㅙ&nbsp;<small>''wae''</small> = ㅗ&nbsp;<small>''o''</small> + ㅐ&nbsp;<small>''ae''</small>
** ㅞ&nbsp;<small>''we''</small> = ㅜ&nbsp;<small>''u''</small> + ㅔ&nbsp;<small>''e''</small>

The compound ''jamo'' ending in ㅣ ''i'' were originally [[diphthong]]s. However, several have since evolved into pure vowels:
** ㅐ&nbsp;<small>''ae''</small> = ㅏ&nbsp;<small>''a''</small> + ㅣ&nbsp;<small>''i''</small>
** ㅔ&nbsp;<small>''e''</small> = ㅓ&nbsp;<small>''eo''</small> + ㅣ&nbsp;<small>''i''</small>
** ㅙ&nbsp;<small>''wae''</small> = ㅘ&nbsp;<small>''wa''</small> + ㅣ&nbsp;<small>''i''</small>
** ㅚ&nbsp;<small>''oe''</small> = ㅗ&nbsp;<small>''o''</small> + ㅣ&nbsp;<small>''i''</small>
** ㅞ&nbsp;<small>''we''</small> = ㅝ&nbsp;<small>''wo''</small> + ㅣ&nbsp;<small>''i''</small>
** ㅟ&nbsp;<small>''wi''</small> = ㅜ&nbsp;<small>''u''</small> + ㅣ&nbsp;<small>''i''</small>
** ㅢ&nbsp;<small>''ui''</small> = ㅡ&nbsp;<small>''eu''</small> + ㅣ&nbsp;<small>''i''</small>

*[[Iotation|Iotized]] vowels: There is no ''jamo'' for Roman ''y'' before a vowel. Instead, this sound is indicated by doubling the stroke attached to the base line of the vowel letter. Of the seven basic vowels, four could be preceded by a ''y'' sound, and these four were written as a dot next to a line. (Through the influence of Chinese calligraphy, the dots soon became connected to the line: ㅓㅏㅜㅗ.) A preceding ''y'' sound, called "iotation", was indicated by doubling this dot: ㅕㅑㅠㅛ <small>''yeo, ya, yu, yo''</small>. The three vowels which could not be iotated were written with a single stroke: ㅡㆍㅣ <small>''eu, (arae a), i''</small>.

** ㅕ&nbsp;<small>''yeo''</small> from ㅓ &nbsp;<small>''eo''</small>

** ㅖ&nbsp;<small>''ye''</small> from ㅔ &nbsp;<small>''e''</small>

The Korean language of the 15th century had [[vowel harmony]] to a greater extent than it does today. Vowels in grammatical [[morpheme]]s changed according to their environment, falling into groups which "harmonized" with each other. This affected the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of the language, and Korean phonology described it in terms of ''yin'' and ''yang:'' If a root word had ''yang'' ('bright') vowels, then most suffixes attached to it also had to have ''yang'' vowels; conversely, if the root had ''yin'' ('dark') vowels, the suffixes needed to be ''yin'' as well. There was a third harmonic group called "mediating" ('neutral' in Western terminology) that could coexist with either ''yin'' or ''yang'' vowels. 

The Korean neutral vowel was ㅣ ''i''. The ''yin'' vowels were ㅡㅜㅓ ''eu, u, eo;'' the dots are in the ''yin'' directions of 'down' and 'left'. The ''yang'' vowels were ㆍㅗㅏ ''ə, o, a,'' with the dots in the ''yang'' directions of 'up' and 'right'. The ''Hunmin Jeong-eum Haerye'' states that the shapes of the non-dotted ''jamo'' ㅡㆍㅣ were chosen to represent the concepts of ''yin,'' ''yang,'' and mediation: Earth, Heaven, and Human. (The letter ㆍ ''ə'' is now obsolete.) 

There was yet a third parameter in designing the vowel ''jamo,'' namely, choosing ㅡ as the graphic base of ㅜ and ㅗ, and ㅣ as the graphic base of ㅓ and ㅏ. A full understanding of what these horizontal and vertical groups had in common would require knowing the exact sound values these vowels had in the 15<sup>th</sup> century. Our uncertainty is primarily with the three ''jamo'' ㆍㅓㅏ. Some linguists reconstruct these as {{IPA|*a, *ɤ, *e}}, respectively; others as {{IPA|*ə, *e, *a}}. However, the horizontal ''jamo'' ㅡㅜㅗ <small>''eu,&nbsp;u,&nbsp;o''</small> do all appear to have been mid to high [[back vowel]]s, {{IPA|[*ɯ, *u, *o]}}, and thus to have formed a coherent group phonetically.

Although the ''Hunmin Jeong-eum Haerye'' explains the design of the consonantal ''jamo'' in terms of [[articulatory phonetics]], as a purely innovative creation, there are several theories as to which external sources may have inspired or influenced King Sejong's creation. Professor [[Gari Ledyard]] of Columbia University believes that five consonant letters were derived from the Mongol [[Phagspa script|Phagspa alphabet]] of the [[Yuan dynasty]], while the rest of the ''jamo'' were derived internally from these five, essentially as described in the ''Hunmin Jeong-eum Haerye''. However, these five basic consonants were not the graphically simplest letters that were considered basic by the ''Hunmin Jeong-eum Haerye'', but instead the consonants basic to Chinese phonology: ㄱ, ㄷ, ㅂ, ㅈ, and ㄹ.

The ''Hunmin Jeong-eum'' states that King Sejong adapted 古篆 ''(Gǔ'' seal script) in creating hangul. The primary meaning of 古 is ''old'', frustrating philologists because hangul bears no functional similarity to Chinese 篆字 [[seal script]]s. However, 古 may also have been a pun on ''Mongol'' (蒙古 ''Měnggǔ''), and 古篆 may have been an abbreviation of 蒙古篆字 "Mongol Seal Script", that is, a formal variant of the Phagspa alphabet written to look like the Chinese seal script. There were certainly Phagspa manuscripts in the Korean palace library, and several of Sejong's ministers knew the script well. 

If this was the case, Sejong's evasion on the Mongol connection can be understood in light of Korea's relationship with Ming China after the fall of the Yuan dynasty, and of the literati's contempt for the Mongols as "barbarians".

According to Ledyard, the five borrowed letters were graphically simplified, which allowed for ''jamo'' clusters and left room to derive the aspirate plosives, ㅋㅌㅍㅊ. But in contrast to the traditional account, the non-plosives (''ng'' ㄴㅁ and ㅅ) were derived by ''removing'' the top of these letters. While it's easy to derive ㅁ from ㅂ by removing the top, as Ledyard posits, it's not clear how to derive ㅂ from ㅁ in the traditional account, since the shape of ㅂ is not analogous to the other plosives.

The explanation of the letter ''ng'' also differs from the traditional account. Many Chinese words began with ''ng'', but by King Sejong's day, initial ''ng'' was either silent or pronounced {{IPA|[ŋ]}} in China, and was silent when these words were borrowed into Korean. Also, the expected shape of ''ng'' (vertical line left by removing the top stroke of ㄱ) would have looked the same as the vowel ㅣ {{IPA|[i]}}. Sejong's solution solved both problems: the vertical stroke from ㄱ was added to the null symbol ㅇ to create ㆁ (a circle with a vertical line on top), iconically capturing both {{IPA|[ŋ]}} in the middle or end of a word, and silence at the beginning. (The distinction between ㅇ and ㆁ was eventually lost.)

Another letter composed of two elements to represent two regional pronunciations was ㅱ, which transcribed the Chinese [[Syllable onset|initial]] 微. This represented either ''m'' or ''w'' in various Chinese dialects, and was composed of ㅁ [m] plus ㅇ (from Phagspa [w]). In Phagspa, a loop under a letter represented ''w'' after vowels, and Ledyard proposes this became the loop at the bottom of ㅱ. Now, in Phagspa the Chinese initial 微 is also transcribed as a compound with ''w,'' but in its case the ''w'' is placed under an ''h.'' Actually, the Chinese consonant series 微非敷 ''w, v, f'' is transcribed in Phagspa by the addition of a ''w'' under three graphic variants of the letter for ''h,'' and Hangul parallels this convention by adding the ''w'' loop to the labial series ㅁㅂㅍ ''m, b, p,'' producing now-obsolete ㅱㅸㆄ ''w, v, f.'' (Phonetic values in Korean are uncertain, as these were only used to transcribe Chinese.)

Finally, most of the borrowed hangul letters were simple geometric shapes, at least originally, but ㄷ ''d'' [t] always had a small lip protruding from the upper left corner, just as the Phagspa ''d'' [t] did. This can be traced back to the Tibetan letter ''d'', ད.

If this theory is the case, then Hangul would be part of the great family of alphabets ultimately developing out of the Middle Eastern [[Phoenician alphabet]] along the route Phoenician > [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]] > [[Brāhmī script|Brāhmī]] > [[Tibetan script|Tibetan]] > Phagspa > Hangul.

===''Jamo'' order===
The alphabetical order of Hangul does not mix consonants and vowels as Western alphabets do. Rather, the order is that of the [[Shiva Sutra|Indic type]], first velar consonants, then coronals, labials, sibilants, ''etc.'' However, the vowels come after the consonants rather than before them as in the Indic systems. 

The modern alphabetic order was set by [[Choi Sejin]] in 1527. This was before the development of the Korean tense consonants and the double ''jamo'' that represent them, and before the conflation of the letters ㅇ (null) and ㆁ (ng). Thus when the [[South Korea]]n and [[North Korea]]n governments implemented full use of Hangul, they ordered these letters differently, with South Korea grouping similar letters together, and North Korea placing new letters at the end of the alphabet. 

====South Korean order====
The Southern order of the consonantal ''jamo'' is,

:ㄱ ㄲ ㄴ ㄷ ㄸ ㄹ ㅁ ㅂ ㅃ ㅅ ㅆ ㅇ ㅈ ㅉ ㅊ ㅋ ㅌ ㅍ ㅎ

Double ''jamo'' are placed immediately after their single counterparts. No distinction is made between silent and nasal ㅇ.

The order of the vocalic ''jamo'' is,

:ㅏ ㅐ ㅑ ㅒ ㅓ ㅔ ㅕ ㅖ ㅗ ㅘ ㅙ ㅚ ㅛ ㅜ ㅝ ㅞ ㅟ ㅠ ㅡ ㅢ ㅣ

The modern [[monophthong]]al vowels come first, with the derived forms interspersed according to their form: first added ''i'', then iotized, then iotized with added ''i''. [[Diphthong]]s beginning with ''w'' are ordered according to their spelling, as ㅏ or ㅓ plus a second vowel, not as separate [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s.

The order of the final ''jamo'' is,
:(none) ㄱ ㄲ ㄳ ㄴ ㄵ ㄶ ㄷ ㄹ ㄺ ㄻ ㄼ ㄽ ㄾ ㄿ ㅀ ㅁ ㅂ ㅄ ㅅ ㅆ ㅇ ㅈ ㅊ ㅋ ㅌ ㅍ ㅎ

"None" stands for no final jamo.

====North Korean order====
North Korea maintains a more traditional order. 

The Northern order of the consonantal ''jamo'' is:

:ㄱ ㄴ ㄷ ㄹ ㅁ ㅂ ㅅ ㅇ (ng) ㅈ ㅊ ㅋ ㅌ ㅍ ㅎ ㄲ ㄸ ㅃ ㅆ ㅉ ㅇ (null)

The first ㅇ is the nasal ㅇ ''ng,'' which occurs only as a final in the modern language. ㅇ used as an initial, on the other hand, goes at the very end, as it is a placeholder for the vowels which follow. (A syllable with no final is ordered before all syllables with finals, however, not with null ㅇ.)

The new letters, the double ''jamo'', are placed at the end of the consonants, just before the null ㅇ, so as not to alter the traditional order of the rest of the alphabet.  

The order of the vocalic ''jamo'' is, 

:ㅏ ㅑ ㅓ ㅕ ㅗ ㅛ ㅜ ㅠ ㅡ ㅣ ㅐ ㅒ ㅔ ㅖ ㅚ ㅟ ㅢ ㅘ ㅝ ㅙ ㅞ

All digraphs and [[trigraph (orthography)|trigraph]]s, including the old diphthongs ㅐ and ㅔ, are placed after all basic vowels, again maintaining Choi's alphabetic order.

===''Jamo'' names===
The Hangul arrangement is called the ''ganada'' order, (가나다 순) which is basically an alphabetical order named after the first three ''jamo'' ''(g, n, d)'' affixed to the first vowel ''(a).'' The ''jamo'' were named by [[Choi Sejin]] in 1527. North Korea regularized the names when it made Hangul its official orthography.

====Consonantal ''jamo'' names====
The modern consonants have two-syllable names, with the consonant coming both at the beginning and end of the name, as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Consonant !! Name
|-
| ㄱ || ''giyeok'' (기역), or ''gieuk'' (기윽) in North Korea
|-
| ㄴ || ''nieun'' (니은)
|-
| ㄷ || ''digeut'' (디귿), or ''dieut'' (디읃) in North Korea
|-
| ㄹ || ''rieul'' (리을)
|-
| ㅁ || ''mieum'' (미음)
|-
| ㅂ || ''bieup'' (비읍)
|-
| ㅅ || ''siot'' (시옷), or ''sieut'' (시읏) in North Korea
|-
| ㅇ || ''ieung'' (이응)
|-
| ㅈ || ''jieut'' (지읒)
|-
| ㅊ || ''chieut'' (치읓)
|-
| ㅋ || ''kieuk'' (키읔)
|-
| ㅌ || ''tieut'' (티읕)
|-
| ㅍ || ''pieup'' (피읖)
|-
| ㅎ || ''hieut'' (히읗)
|}

All ''jamo'' in North Korea, and all but three in the more traditional nomenclature used in South Korea, have names of the format of ''letter'' + ''i'' + ''eu'' + ''letter''. For example, Choi wrote ''bieup'' with the ''hanja'' 非 ''bi'' 邑 ''eup''. The names of ''g,'' ''d,'' and ''s'' are exceptions because there were no ''hanja'' for ''euk,'' ''eut,'' and ''eus''. 役 ''yeok'' is used in place of ''euk''. Since there is no ''hanja'' that ends in ''t'' or ''s,'' Choi chose two ''hanja'' to be read in their Korean gloss, 末 ''kkeut'' "end" and 衣 ''os'' "clothes".

Originally, Choi gave ''j, ch, k, t, p,'' and ''h'' the irregular one-syllable names of ''ji, chi, ki, ti, pi,'' and ''hi,'' because they should not be used as final consonants, as specified in ''Hunmin jeong-eum''. But after the establishment of the new orthography in 1933, which allowed all consonsants to be used as finals, the names were changed to the present forms.

The double ''jamo'' precede the parent consonant's name with the word 쌍 ''ssang,'' meaning "twin" or "double", or with 된 ''doen'' in North Korea, meaning "strong".  Thus:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Letter !! South Korean Name !! North Korean name
|-
| ㄲ || ''ssanggiyeok'' (쌍기역) || ''doengieuk'' (된기윽)
|-
| ㄸ || ''ssangdigeut'' (쌍디귿) || ''doendieut'' (된디읃)
|-
| ㅃ || ''ssangbieup'' (쌍비읍) || ''doenbieup'' (된비읍)
|-
| ㅆ || ''ssangsiot'' (쌍시옷) || ''doensieut'' (된시읏)
|-
| ㅉ || ''ssangjieut'' (쌍지읒) || ''doenjieut'' (된지읒)
|}

In North Korea, an alternate way to refer to the ''jamo'' is by the name ''letter'' + ''eu'' (ㅡ), for example, 그 ''geu'' for the ''jamo'' ㄱ, 쓰 ''sseu'' for the ''jamo'' ㅆ, etc.

====Vocalic ''jamo'' names====
The vocalic ''jamo'' names are simply the vowel itself, written with the null initial ㅇ ''ieung'' and the vowel being named. Thus:

{|
! Letter !! Name
|-
| ㅏ || ''a'' (아)
|-
| ㅐ || ''ae'' (애)
|-
| ㅑ || ''ya'' (야)
|-
| ㅒ || ''yae'' (얘)
|-
| ㅓ || ''eo'' (어)
|-
| ㅔ || ''e'' (에)
|-
| ㅕ || ''yeo'' (여)
|-
| ㅖ || ''ye'' (예)
|-
| ㅗ || ''o'' (오)
|-
| ㅘ || ''wa'' (와)
|-
| ㅙ || ''wae'' (왜)
|-
| ㅚ || ''oe'' (외)
|-
| ㅛ || ''yo'' (요)
|-
| ㅜ || ''u'' (우)
|-
| ㅝ || ''wo'' (워)
|-
| ㅞ || ''we'' (웨)
|-
| ㅟ || ''wi'' (위)
|-
| ㅠ || ''yu'' (유)
|-
| ㅡ || ''eu'' (으)
|-
| ㅢ || ''ui'' (의)
|-
| ㅣ || ''i'' (이)
|}

===Obsolete ''jamo''===
Several ''jamo'' are obsolete. These include several that represent Korean sounds that have since disappeared from the standard language, as well as a larger number used to represent the sounds of the Chinese [[rime table]]s. The most frequently encountered of these archaic letters are:

* ㆍ (transcribed {{IPA|ə}} or {{IPA|ʌ}} (''arae-a'' 아래아 “lower ''a''”): Presumably {{pronounced|ʌ}}, similar to modern ''eo''. It is written as a dot, positioned beneath (Korean for "beneath" is ''arae'') the consonant. The ''arae-a'' is not entirely obsolete, as it can been found in various brand names and is often used in spelling the dialect of Jeju Island, Korea's southernmost province. Even so, it was not transcribed in the official [[Revised Romanization of Korean|Korean Romanization]] and thus modern renderings of the Jeju dialect transcribe it the same way as ㅗ, that is, ''o''. Korean words that were written with ㆍ long ago are now usually written with ㅏ.
**The ''ə'' formed a medial of its own, or was found in the diphthong ㆎ ''arae-ae'', written with the dot under the consonant and ㅣ (transcribed ''i'') to its right — in the same fashion as ㅚ or ㅢ.
* ㅿ ''z'' (''bansios'' 반시옷): A rather unusual sound, perhaps IPA {{Unicode|[ʝ͂]}} (a [[nasalized]] [[Voiced palatal fricative|palatal fricative]]). Modern Korean words previously spelled with ㅿ substitute ㅅ.
* ㆆ ''ʔ'' (''yeorin hieuh'' 여린 히읗 "light hieuh" or ''doen ieung'' 된 이응 "strong ieung"): A [[glottal stop]], "lighter than ㅎ and harsher than ㅇ".
* ㆁ ''ŋ'' (''yet-ieung'' 옛이응): The original ''jamo'' for {{IPA|[ŋ]}}; now conflated with ㅇ ''ieung''. (With some computer [[typeface|fonts]], ''yet-ieung'' is shown as a flattened version of ''ieung,'' but the correct form is with a long peak, longer than what you would see on a [[serif]] version of ''ieung.)''
* ㅸ ''β'' (''gabyeoun bieup'' 가벼운비읍): IPA {{IPA|[f]}}. This letter appears to be a digraph of ''bieup'' and ''ieung,'' but it may be more complicated than that. There were three other less common ''jamo'' for sounds in this section of the Chinese [[rime table]]s, ㅱ ''w'' ([w] or [m]), a theoretical ㆄ ''f,'' and ㅹ ''ff'' {{IPA|[v̤]}}; the bottom element appears to be only coincidentally similar to ''ieung.''

There were two other now-obsolete double ''jamo'',
* ㆅ ''x'' (''ssanghieuh'' 쌍히읗 "double ''hieuh"):'' IPA {{IPA|[ɣ̈ʲ]}} or {{IPA|[ɣ̈]}}. 
* ㆀ (''ssang-ieung'' 쌍이응 "double ''ieung"):'' Another ''jamo'' used in the Chinese rime table. 

In the original Hangul system, double ''jamo'' were used to represent Chinese voiced (濁音) consonants, which survive in the [[Shanghainese (dialect)|Shanghainese]] [[slack voice|slack]] consonants, and were not used for Korean words. It was only later that a similar convention was used to represent the modern "tense" ([[Faucalized voice|faucalized]]) consonants of Korean.

The sibilant ("dental") consonants were modified to represent the two series of Chinese sibilants, [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] and [[Retroflex consonants|retroflex]], a "round" vs. "sharp" distinction which was never made in Korean, and which was even being lost from northern Chinese. The alveolar ''jamo'' had longer left stems, while retroflexes had longer right stems:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Original consonants
| ㅅ || ㅆ || ㅈ || ㅉ || ㅊ
|-
! ''Chidueum'' (alveolar sibilant)
| ᄼ || ᄽ || ᅎ || ᅏ || ᅔ
|-
! ''Jeongchieum'' (retroflex sibilant)
| ᄾ || ᄿ || ᅐ || ᅑ || ᅕ
|}

There were also [[consonant cluster]]s that have since dropped out of the language, such as ㅴ ''bsg'' and ㅵ ''bsd,'' as well as [[diphthong]]s that were used to represent Chinese medials, such as ㆇ, ㆈ, ㆊ, ㆋ.

Some of the Korean sounds represented by these obsolete jamo still exist in some dialects.

==Syllabic blocks==
Except for a few grammatical morphemes in archaic texts, no letter may stand alone to represent elements of the Korean language. Instead, ''jamo'' are grouped into [[syllable|syllabic]] blocks of at least two and often three: (1) a consonant or [[consonant cluster]] called the '''initial''' (초성, <span lang="ko">初聲</span> ''choseong'' [[syllable onset]]), (2) a vowel or [[diphthong]] called the '''medial''' (중성, <span lang="ko">中聲</span> ''jungseong'' [[syllable nucleus]]), and, optionally, (3) a consonant or consonant cluster at the end of the syllable, called the '''final''' (종성, <span lang="ko">終聲</span> ''jongseong'' [[syllable coda]]). When a syllable has no actual initial consonant, the null initial ㅇ ''ieung'' is used as a placeholder. (In modern Hangul, placeholders are not used for the final position.) Thus, a syllabic block contains a minimum of two ''jamo,'' an initial and a medial.

The sets of initial and final consonants are not the same. For instance, ㅇ ''ng'' only occurs in final position, while the doubled ''jamo'' that can occur in final position are limited to  ㅆ ''ss'' and  ㄲ ''kk''. For a list of initials, medials, and finals, see [[Hangul consonant and vowel tables]].

The placement or "stacking" of ''jamo'' in the block follows set patterns based on the shape of the medial.
* The components of complex ''jamo,'' such as ㅄ ''bs,'' ㅝ ''wo,'' or obsolete ㅵ ''bsd,'' ㆋ ''üye'' are written left to right. 

* Medials are written under the initial, to the right, or wrap around the initial from bottom to right, depending on their shape: If the medial has a horizontal axis like ㅡ ''eu,'' then it is written under the initial; if it has a vertical axis like ㅣ ''i,'' then it is written to the right of the initial; and if it combines both orientations, like ㅢ ''ui,'' then it wraps around the initial from the bottom to the right:

</td></tr>
</table> 

* A final ''jamo,'' if there is one, is  always written at the bottom, under the medial. This is called 받침 ''batchim'' "supporting floor":

</table>

Blocks are always written in phonetic order, initial-medial-final. Therefore, 
*Syllables with a horizontal medial are written downward: 읍 ''eup'';
*Syllables with a vertical medial and simple final are written clockwise: 쌍 ''ssang'';
*Syllables with a wrapping medial switch direction (down-right-down): 된 ''doen'';
*Syllables with a complex final are written left to right at the bottom: 밟 ''balp''.

The resulting block is written within a rectangle of the same size and shape as a ''[[hanja]],'' so to a naive eye Hangul may be confused with ''hanja''.

Not including obsolete ''jamo,'' there are 11&nbsp;172 possible Hangul blocks.

===Linear Hangul===
There was a minor movement in the [[twentieth century]] to abolish syllabic blocks and write the ''jamo'' individually and in a row, in the fashion of the Western alphabets: e.g. ㅎㅏㄴㄱㅡㄹ for 한글 ''hangul.'' However, it was unsuccessful, partly due to its low legibility.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

==Orthography==
Until the 20th century, no official orthography of Hangul had been established. Due to liaison, heavy consonant assimilation, dialectical variants and other reasons, a Korean word can potentially be spelled in various ways. King Sejong seemed to prefer [[Morphophonology|morphophonemic]] spelling (representing the underlying morphology) rather than a [[phoneme|phonemic]] one (representing the actual sounds). However, early in its history, Hangul was dominated by phonemic spelling. Over the centuries the orthography became partially morphophonemic, first in nouns, and later in verbs. Today it is as morphophonemic as is practical.

After the [[Gabo Reform]] in 1894, the [[Joseon Dynasty]] and later the [[Korean Empire]] started to write all official documents in Hangul. Under the government's management, proper usage of Hangul, including orthography, was discussed, until Korea was [[Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty|annexed]] by Japan in 1910.

The Japanese [[Government-General of Chosen]] established the writing style of a mixture of Hanja and Hangul, as in the Japanese writing system. The government revised the spelling rules in 1912, 1921 and 1930, which were relatively phonemic.

The [[Hangul Society]], originally founded by [[Ju Si-gyeong]], announced a proposal for a new, strongly morphophonemic orthography in 1933, which became the prototype of the contemporary orthographies in both North and South Korea. After Korea was divided, the North and South revised orthographies separately. The guiding text for [[Hangul orthography]] is called ''Hangeul machumbeop,'' whose last South Korean revision was published in 1988 by the Ministry of Education.

===Mixed scripts===
Since the Late Joseon dynasty period, various ''Hanja-Hangul mixed systems'' were used. In these systems, Hanja was used for lexical roots, and Hangul for grammatical words and inflections, much as ''kanji'' and ''kana'' are used in Japanese. But unlike in Japanese, Hanja was used only for nouns. Today however, ''hanja'' have been almost entirely phased out of daily use in North Korea, and in South Korea they are now mostly restricted to parenthetical glosses for proper names and for disambiguating homonyms. 

Arabic numerals can also be mixed in with hangul, as in 2007년 3월 22일 ([[22 March]],[[2007]]). 

The Roman alphabet, and occasionally other alphabets, may be sprinkled within Korean texts for illustrative purposes, or for unassimilated [[loanword]]s.

==Style==
Hangul may be written either vertically or horizontally. The traditional direction is the Chinese style of writing top to bottom, right to left. Horizontal writing in the style of the Roman alphabet was promoted by [[Ju Sigyeong]], and has become overwhelmingly preferred.

In ''[[Hunmin Jeongeum]]'', Hangul was printed in sans-serif angular lines of even thickness.  This style is found in books published before about 1900, and can be found today in stone carvings (on statues, for example).

[[Image:Korean styles.png|thumb|Three Korean type styles]]

Over the centuries, an ink-brush style of [[calligraphy]] developed, employing the same style of lines and angles as Chinese calligraphy. This brush style is called ''gungche'' (궁체), which means "Palace Style" because the style was mostly developed and used by the maidservants (''gungnyeo,'' 궁녀) of the court in Joseon dynasty.

Modern styles that are more suited for printed media were developed in the [[20th century]], which were more or less influenced by Japanese typefaces, the serifed ''Myeongjo'' (derived from Japanese [[minchō]]) and [[sans-serif]] ''Gothic'' (from Japanese [[Japanese gothic typeface|Gothic]]) being the foremost examples. Variations of these styles are widely used today in books, newspapers, and magazines, and several computer [[typeface|fonts]]. In 1993, new names for both Myeongjo and Gothic styles were introduced when Ministry of Culture initiated an effort to standardize typographic terms, and the names ''Batang'' (바탕, meaning "background") and ''Dotum'' (돋움, meaning "stand out") replaced Myeongjo and Gothic respectively. These names are also used in [[Microsoft Windows]].

A sans-serif style with lines of equal width is popular with pencil and pen writing, and is often the default typeface of Web browsers. A minor advantage of this style is that it makes it easier to distinguish ''-eung'' from ''-ung'' even in small or untidy print, as the ''jongseong ieung'' (ㅇ) of such fonts usually lacks a [[serif]] that could be mistaken for the ㅜ ''(u) jamo''<nowiki></nowiki>'s short vertical line.
