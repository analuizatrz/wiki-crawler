'''Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovsky''' ({{lang-ru|Влади́мир Во́льфович Жирино́вский}}, born [[April 25]], [[1946]] as '''Vladimir Volfovich Eidelstein''') is a [[Russia]]n politician, founder and the leader of the [[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]] (LDPR), Vice-[[Chairman]] of the [[State Duma]], and a member of the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|Parliamentary Assembly]] of the [[Council of Europe]]. Despite its name, LDPR is often described as an [[Ultranationalism|ultra-nationalist]] party.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7102153.stMoscow Diary: Campaign circus] [[BBC News]], 20 November 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9115420/Zhirinovsky-Vladimir ''Zhirinovsky, Vladimir'' Encyclopædia Britannica Online]</ref><ref>[http://en.rian.ru/russia/20071213/92278399.html Russian ultranationalist Zhirinovsky nominated for president] [[RIA Novosti]], 13/ 12/ 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,980142,00.html Zhirinovsky Beat Russia's top ultranationalist had a busy week abroad] ''[[Time Magazine]]'', Feb. 14, 1994</ref>

==Early life and politics==
Zhirinovsky was born in [[Almaty|Alma-Ata]], the former [[capital]] of the then-[[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet Republic]] of [[Kazakhstan]]. In July 1964, Zhirinovsky moved from Alma-Ata to [[Moscow]], where he began his studies in the Department of Turkish Studies, Institute of Asian and African Studies at [[Moscow State University]] (MSU), from which he graduated in 1969. Zhirinovsky then went into [[military service]] in [[Tbilisi]] during the early 1970s. He would later get a law degree and work at various posts in state committees and unions. He was awarded a [[Candidate of Sciences|Ph.D.]] in philosophy by MSU in 1998.

Zhirinovsky, whose father was a [[Polish Jew]], began his formal political career in the Shalom Cultural Society, a [[Judaism|Jewish]] organization given support by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet government]] in order to compete with independent Jewish groups which sprang up during the era of ''[[glasnost]]'' under the tenure of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in the latter part of the decade.<ref>[http://www.jcpa.org/cjc/cjc-satanovsky-s02.htm Organized National Life of Russian Jews in the Late Soviet and Post-Soviet Era: a View from Moscow]</ref><ref name="jewish">[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE4D81239F935A25751C1A965958260 In Moscow, Zhirinovsky Is Remembered as Jewish Advocate], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 16, 1993 </ref> (On a private visit to [[Israel]] in June 2006, Zhirinovsky paid his first visit to the grave of his father, Wolf Isakovich Eidelstein, who is buried in [[Holon]], Israel.<ref name=Haaretz>{{cite news|first=Yossi|last=Melman|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/732918.html|title=The Jewish Side of the Family|publisher=''[[Haaretz]]''|date=2006-06-30}}</ref>)

Although he participated in some underground [[reform]]ist groups, Zhirinovsky was largely inconsequential in Soviet political developments during the 1980s. While he contemplated a role in politics, a nomination attempt for a seat as a People's Deputy in 1989 was quickly abandoned.<ref>[http://www.panorama.ru/works/oe/zhirinoe.html Zhirinovsky Vladimir Volfovich] Panorama.ru</ref>

==Liberal-Democratic Party==

In 1990, Zhirinovsky, along with [[Vladimir Bogachev]], took initiatives which led to the founding of the [[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia|Liberal Democratic Party]], the second registered party in the [[Soviet Union]] and therefore the first officially sanctioned [[Opposition (parliamentary)|opposition party]]. This party was a joint project of [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU) leadership and the [[KGB]]<ref name="jewish"/><ref name="nuclear"/> according to former [[CPSU Politburo]] member [[Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev]]. Yakovlev wrote in his memories that KGB director [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]] presented the project of the puppet LDPR party at a meeting with [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and informed him about a selection of the LDPR leader. According to Yakovlev, the name of the party was invented by KGB General [[Philipp Bobkov]]. However Bobkov said that he was against the creation of this "[[Sergei Vasilyevich Zubatov|Zubatov's]] pseudo-party under KGB control that directs interests and sentiments of certain social groups".<ref> [[Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev]] ''Time of darkness'', Moscow, 2003, ISBN 5-85646-097-9, page 574 ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Яковлев А. Сумерки. Москва: Материк 2003 г.). The book provides an official copy of a document providing the initial LDPR  funding (3 million rubles) from the CPSU money</ref>

Zhirinovsky's first political breakthrough came in June 1991 when he came in third at Russia's first [[Russian presidential election, 1991|presidential elections]], gathering more than six million votes or 7.81%. Afterwards, the LDPR garnered a reputation as an ineffective vehicle for opposition against the government, and one that lacked either credibility or authenticity, particularly given Zhirinovsky's vocal support for the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991]]. This view was further encouraged by rumors, denied by Zhirinovsky, that he was an agent of the KGB and that the LDPR was a farcical creation meant to either discredit or distract earnest opposition to the government. Such impressions would last even as the Soviet Union was dissolved and the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|Communist Party]] itself was thrown into an opposition role.

Nonetheless, the Liberal-Democratic Party remained an important force in [[Politics of Russia|Russian politics]]. At the height of its fortunes, the LDPR gathered 23% of the vote in the 1993 Duma elections and achieved a broad representation throughout the country - the LDPR being the top vote-getter in 64 out of 87 regions. This fact encouraged Zhirinovsky to once again vie for the presidential office, this time against incumbent [[Boris Yeltsin]]. The fact that Yeltsin's candidacy seemed seriously challenged by Russian nationalist groups and a rejuvenated Communist Party alarmed many outside observers, particularly in the [[Western world]], who were concerned that such developments posed a serious threat to the survival of Russian democracy, already in a very fragile state. Zhirinovsky became a focal point of harsh criticism and seemed to be the living embodiment of [[authoritarianism]] and [[militarism]] in modern Russia.

For his own part, Zhirinovsky has done a great deal to foster a reputation as a loud and boisterous [[populism|populist]] who speaks on behalf of the Russian nation and people, even when the things he says are precisely what many people, at home or abroad, do not want to hear. Zhirinovsky infamously promised voters in 1991 that if he were elected, free [[vodka]] would be distributed to all. Similarly, he once remarked, during a political rally inside a Moscow department store, that if he were made president, [[underwear]] would be freely available.<ref name=Fedarko>{{cite news|first=Kevin|last=Fedarko|url=http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,979889,00.html|title=A Farce to Be Reckoned With|publisher=''[[TIME]]''|date=1993-12-27}}</ref> He has on several occasions been involved in altercations with other politicians and debate opponents. As a candidate, Zhirinovsky also took part in the [[Russian presidential election, 2000|2000]] and [[Russian presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential elections]], promising a "[[police state]]".<ref name="nuclear">[http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,538403,00.html Nuclear Threats and Busty Ladies in the Race for Second-Place in Russia] ''[[Der Spiegel]]'',  February 28, 2008</ref>

==Controversies==
{{criticism-section}}
Zhirinovsky has been widely accused of [[anti-Semitism]] (he also suggested that Jews were often to blame for anti-Semitism<ref name="jewish"/>) for statements in which he accused Jews of ruining Russia, sending Russian women to foreign countries as [[prostitution|prostitutes]], selling children and organs to the [[Western world]], and provoking [[the Holocaust]]. He repeatedly denied his father's Jewishness until he published ''Ivan Close Your Soul'' in July 2001, describing how his father, Volf Isaakovich Eidelshtein, changed his [[surname]] from Eidelshtein to Zhirinovsky. He [[rhetoric]]ally asked, "Why should I reject Russian blood, Russian culture, Russian land, and fall in love with the Jewish people only because of that single drop of blood that my father left in my mother's body?"<ref name="antisemitism">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1446759.stm Zhirinovsky admits Jewish roots] [[BBC News]], 19 July, 2001</ref> 

Zhirinovsky is well known for his boasts pertaining to other countries, having expressed a desire to reunite countries of the ex-Soviet "[[near abroad]]" with Russia to within the Russia's borders of 1900 (including [[Finland]] and [[Poland]]). He also said he's dreaming of a day "when Russian soldiers can wash their boots in the warm waters of the [[Indian Ocean]] and switch to year-round summer uniforms",<ref name="boots">[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/12/08/1070732141347.html Ultra-right gains in poll] ''[[The Age]]'', December 9, 2003</ref> following the Russia's conquest of [[Afghanistan]], [[Iran]] and [[Turkey]] and occupation of the [[Persian Gulf]] and the [[Mediterranean]].<ref name="big bad">[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1571/is_n4_v10/ai_14800970 Zhirinovsky is Russia's big bad wolf - success of Vladimir Wolfovich Zhirinovsky in recent Russian elections - Column]</ref> Zhirinovsky has advocated forcibly retaking [[Alaska]] from the [[United States]] (which would then become "a great place to put the [[Ukrainians]]"), turning [[Kazakhstan]] into "Russia's back yard", dumping [[nuclear waste]] in [[Germany]] and in the [[Baltic states]], provoking wars between the [[clan]]s and the peoples of the former Soviet Union and occupying what will remain of it when the wars are over, and using [[nuclear weapons]] and naval [[blockade]]-imposed [[starvation]] against [[Japan]].<ref name="threats">[http://www.acs.brockport.edu/~dgusev/Russian/vzbio.html Vladimir Zhirinovsky] Information Technology Services at SUNY Brockport</ref> 

In July 2007, in response to questions about Russian troops carrying out extensive [[war game]]s which reportedly included rehearsals of a [[Baltic]] invasion, Zhirinovsky, who encourages [[separatism]] within the Russian [[minority]] in the Baltic states,<ref name="nuclear" /> endorsed the forcible re-occupation of these countries.<ref>[http://www.baltictimes.com/news/articles/18220/ Russia threatens Baltic missile build-up] ''The Baltic Times'', Jul 05, 2007</ref> Russia’s southern neighbor [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] has been another frequent target of Zhirinovsky’s rhetoric.<ref>[http://english.pravda.ru/world/ussr/5516-0/ Vladimir Zhirinovsky: Georgia brings trouble to Russia.] [[Pravda.ru]].

In a high-profile incident in August 2004, he departed on a campaign to promote a [[tourist season]] in Abkhazia, accompanied by dozens of his party activists and Russian journalists aboard a [[cruise ship]] which was briefly intercepted by a Georgian [[coast guard]] vessel.<ref>Inal Khashig ([[August 19]] [[2004]]), [http://iwpr.net/?p=crs&s=f&o=159919&apc_state=henicrs2004 Abkhazia Revels in Nationalist’s Visit.] [[Institute for War and Peace Reporting]] Caucasus Reporting Service No. 247.</ref> He also declared [[Bulgaria]] should [[annexation|annex]] the [[Republic of Macedonia]]. About [[Romania]], he said it is an artificial state supposedly created by [[Italy|Italian]] [[Gypsy|Gypsies]] who seized territory from Russia, Bulgaria and [[Hungary]].<ref name="hello"/> 

Zhirinovsky hailed what he described as "the [[democracy|democratic]] process" in [[Iraq]] under [[Saddam Hussein]], whom he supported strongly. The friendship dated at least until the first [[Gulf War]] in 1991, during which time Zhirinovsky sent several armed [[volunteer]]s from the "Falcons of Zhirinovsky" group to support the Iraqi president. Allegations have dogged Zhirinovsky closely since [[2003 invasion of Baghdad|the fall of Baghdad]] that he personally profited from illicit oil sales as part of the [[Oil-for-Food Programme|Oil-for Food scandal]], a charge investigated in 2005 by the Independent Inquiry Committee into the Oil-for-Food Programme ([[Paul Volcker|Volcker]] Commission) and the [[United States Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations|US Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations]] (PSI).<ref>{{PDFlink|http://www.access.gpo.gov/congress/senate/pdf/109hrg/21438.pdf|78.0&nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 81820301 bytes -->}}</ref> Zhirinovsky is also close to the [[Serbia]]n ultra-nationalist leader and [[war crime]]s suspect [[Vojislav Šešelj]].<ref name="threats"/> He reportedly even praised [[Adolf Hitler]]'s ideology of [[Nazism]]<ref name="threats"/> and befriended [[Edwin Neuwirth]] (an [[Austria]]n industialist and a "proud" former officer of the [[Waffen-SS]] who has denied that the Nazis used [[gas chamber]]s to kill Jews during [[World War II]]), leading the German press to denounce him as the "Russia's Hitler".<ref name="nuclear"/><ref name="hello">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,979934-1,00.html Hello, I Must Be Going] ''[[Time Magazine]]'', Jan. 10, 1994</ref>

Zhirinovsky has expressed admiration for the [[United States presidential election, 1996|1996 United States presidential election]] contender [[Pat Buchanan]], and referred positively to a comment in which Buchanan labeled the [[United States Congress]] "Israeli-occupied territory". Zhirinovsky said that both countries were "under occupation" and that "to survive, we could set aside places on US and Russian territories to [[Deportation|deport]] this small but troublesome [[tribe]]." Buchanan strongly rejected Zhirinovsky's endorsement, saying he would provide safe haven to [[persecution|persecuted]] [[minority|minorities]] if Zhirinovsky were ever elected Russia's president, eliciting a harsh response by Zhirinovsky: "You soiled your pants as soon as you got my congratulations. Who are you afraid of? [[Zionism|Zionists]]?"<ref name="buchanan">[http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/3063/edition_id/54/format/html/displaystory.html Russia's Zhirinovsky now blasts Buchanan as 'crap'] ''[[Jewish News Weekly]]'', March 1, 1996</ref> Previously, during the 1992 visit to the United States, Zhirinovsky called on television "for the preservation of the [[white race]]" and warned that the white Americans were in danger of turning "their country" over to [[black people|black]] and [[Hispanic]] people.<ref name="joke">[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03EED6153EF935A35752C1A962958260 The World; Here Comes the Clown.

Lee</ref> 

In 1999, at the start of the [[Second Chechen War]], Zhirinovsky, the ardent supporter of [[First Chechen War|the first war in Chechnya]] in the mid-1990s, advocated hitting some [[Chechen people|Chechen]] villages with [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s.<ref>[http://www.rferl.org/specials/russianelection/archives/07-171299.asp Russian Parliamentary Election 1999] [[RFE/RL]], 17 December 1999</ref> In 2006, in answer to the [[Ramzan Kadyrov]]'s support for [[polygamy]] in [[Chechnya]], he said it should be applied across Russia.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4610396.stm Polygamy proposal for Chechen men] [[BBC News]], 13 January 2006</ref> To eradicate [[bird flu]], Zhirinovsky proposed arming all of Russia's population and ordering them and the troops to shoot down the migrant birds returning to Russia from [[wintering]].<ref>[http://news.rin.ru/eng/news///6243/ Action for protection of birds from Zhirinovsky to be held in Moscow]</ref> He has also threatened to remove restrictions on arms sales to [[Iran]] and proposed to sell the disputed [[Kurile Islands]] to Japan for $50m.<ref name="eccentric">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/667745.stm Zhirinovsky: Russia's political eccentric] [[BBC News]], March 10, 2000</ref> Among his early threats, Zhirinovsky claimed Russia possesses "Elipton," a [[weapon of mass destruction]] supposedly more powerful than nuclear weapons.<ref name="hello"/> 

In 2005, the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] of Kazakhstan declared Zhirinovsky ''[[persona non grata]]'' on the territory of his historical homeland, due to the politician's controversial speech about the change of the Russia-Kazakhstan border, in which he questioned the [[Kazakhs|Kazakh people's]] place in history. Zhirinovsky maintains his view, claiming that his position is backed by a number of academic works on history and geography.<ref>{{ru icon}} [http://lenta.ru/russia/2005/02/10/zhirinovsky1/ Жириновскому запретили приезжать на историческую родину] from [[Lenta.ru]]</ref> As of 2006, Zhirinovsky was ''persona non grata'' also in [[Ukraine]] following his statements regarding the January 2006 [[Russia-Ukraine gas dispute]] (this was revoked in 2007). In reaction to [[Condoleezza Rice]]'s criticism of [[Foreign relations of Russia|Russian foreign policy]] during the dispute, Zhirinovsky stated that "Condoleezza Rice needs a company of soldiers [and] needs to be taken to [[barracks]] where she would be satisfied."<ref>[http://english.pravda.ru/main/18/88/354/16724_Condoleezza.html Condoleezza Rice's anti-Russian stance based on sexual problems] ''[[Pravda]]'', 11.01.2006</ref> In the past, Zhirinovsky has been expelled from Bulgaria for insulting its president and was also barred from entry to Germany.<ref name="eccentric" />

On the November 2006 death by poisoning of Russian [[defection|defector]] [[Alexander Litvinenko]], Zhirinovsky said: "Any [[traitor]] must be eliminated using any methods. If you have joined the special services to work, then you should work, but to betray, to run away abroad, to give up the secrets you learned while working - all of this looks bad."<ref name="www.ebru.tv">[http://www.ebru.tv/en/News/a.503.html Former KGB Agent Dies] [[Associated Press]], 24 November 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20061124/spy_kremlin_061125/20061126?hub=TopStories Dead ex-spy claimed Russian agent monitored him] [[CTV Television Network|CTV]], Nov. 25 2006</ref> [[Sergei Abeltsev]], Zhirinovsky's former [[bodyguard]] and [[State Duma]] member from the LDPR, added: "The deserved punishment reached the traitor.

Zhirinovsky also has a history of igniting personal violence in political contexts. In his notorious debate with [[Boris Nemtsov]] in 1995 a "juice fight" broke out.<ref>{{ru icon}} [http://www.vesti.ru/news.html?id=34546 Жириновский снова брызнул соком] from Vesti.ru</ref> In 2003, Zhirinovsky engaged in a fistfight after a television debate with [[Mikhail Delyagin]].<ref>[http://www.eng.yabloko.ru/Publ/2003/PAPERS/11/031124_mt.html Zhirinovsky Gets Into Fistfight After Televised Election Debate] ''[[The Moscow Times]]'', November 24, 2003 (mirrored by yabloko.ru)</ref> In 2005, Zhirinovsky ignited a brawl in the parliament by spitting at a [[Rodina]] party legislator, [[Andrei Saveliyev]].<ref>[http://newsfromrussia.com/main/2005/03/30/58932.html Flamboyant Russian lawmaker in parliament chamber brawl] News from Russia</ref> In 2008, he has showed himself shooting a rifle at the targets representing his political rivals.<ref name="nuclear" /> 

While some observers were inclined to consider such controversies  as stark efforts to drum up nationalist support and should not be viewed as anything more serious than electoral fodder meant for domestic consumption, there was great consternation at the fact that in February 1996, months before a [[Russian presidential election, 1996|presidential election]], Zhirinovsky placed second in opinion polls, behind Communist [[Gennady Zyuganov]] and ahead of Boris Yeltsin. In the end, however, Zhirinovsky placed fifth with a 5.7% share in the first round of voting. Since then, the party's fortunes have somewhat stabilized, with the [[Russian legislative election, 2003|2003 election]] seeing a LDPR vote share of 11.7%, while the effect of Zhirinovsky's personality only increased his irrelevancy in successive presidential elections. (In 2004, Zhirinovsky declined to even [[Russian presidential election, 2004|be nominated by the party]], leaving that role to [[Oleg Malyshkin]], who received a nearly negligible portion of the vote.)
