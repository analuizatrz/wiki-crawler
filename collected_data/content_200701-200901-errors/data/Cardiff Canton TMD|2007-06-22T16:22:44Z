'''Cardiff Canton TMD''' is a diesel locomotive [[Traction Maintenance Depot]] which is situated outside [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]]. The depot code is CF.

Originally built as the main maintenance base for the [[South Wales Railway]], it became the major Welsh engineering base for the [[Great Western Railway]]. A heavy overhaul base for [[British Railways]], it then became a joint [[EWS]]/[[Arriva Trains Wales]] depot. After shut down of the EWS depot as a maintenance centre from [[10 December]], [[2005]]<ref>http://www.arriva.co.uk/arriva/en/investor_relations/regulatory_news/rnsitem?id=1173337272nRN1H5366S&t=popup</ref>(still used for long term storage and occasional stabling), it is now solely operated by Arriva Trains Wales.

==History==
===Steam===
Cardiff Canton opened in June [[1882]] as a six road, 240 feet long shed was built to replace Long Dyke, 1.5 miles east of Cardiff General station. The facility was extended in [[1897]] when a 55ft diameter turntable was installed in a square building with 28 roads radiating of off the turntable. In [[1925]] a locomotive repair and lifting shed was built together with a new coaling stage by the GWR. In [[1931]] the original 55ft. turntable was removed and replaced by a larger 65ft. diameter table at the west end of the yard.  At this time, around the peak of GWR operation, the depot had allocated 50 main line passenger locomotives, 40 heavy goods/mineral locomotives and 30 smaller local passenger/goods and shunting locomotives. The depot closed to steam traction on [[8 September]], [[1962]].

===Diesel===
During the winter of [[1962]]/[[1963]], Kyle Stewart contracted to [[British Rail]] built a new Â£1,324,000 complex which occupied a 30 acre site. The original allocation was 360 locomotives for major maintenance, 197 for normal maintenance and 62 shunting locomotives.  Employed were 40 managerial and supervisory staff, 31 clerical staff, 382 maintenance staff and 55 unskilled staff. The new depot was opened by The Rt. Hon. Lord Brecon (Minister of State for Welsh Affairs) on [[18 September]], [[1964]]<ref>http://www.lococarriage.org.uk/canton.htm</ref>.
