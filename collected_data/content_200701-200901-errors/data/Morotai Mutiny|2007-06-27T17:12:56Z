The "'''Morotai Mutiny'''" was an incident involving several senior flyers of the [[Australian First Tactical Air Force]] (1TAF) in April 1945. The pilots, including Australia's top-scoring [[Flying ace|ace]], [[Group Captain]] [[Clive Caldwell]], tendered their resignations in protest at what they saw as the relegation of [[Royal Australian Air Force|RAAF]] [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] squadrons to strategically unimportant [[close air support|ground attack]] missions. Investigations resulted in three high-ranking officers, including the commander of 1TAF, being relieved of their posts.

==Background==
1TAF, commanded by [[Air Commodore]] [[Arthur Henry Cobby|Harry Cobby]], was the main frontline unit of the RAAF in 1944–45. It came within the operational control of [[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lt Gen.]] [[George C. Kenney]], [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF), Allied air commander in the [[South West Pacific Area (command)|South West Pacific Area]] under [[General of the Army|General]] [[Douglas MacArthur]]. Initially made up of one [[Bristol Beaufighter|Beaufighter]] and two [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Kittyhawk]] wings, 1TAF was augmented in 1945 by No. 80 Wing, commanded by Caldwell. This force comprised three [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] squadrons, whose pilots included a number of veterans of the air war over [[Western Europe]], the [[North African campaign]] and the [[Japanese air attacks on Australia, 1942–43|defence of Northern Australia against Japanese air raids]].

By early 1945, Japanese air power in the South West Pacific had been virtually destroyed. [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] forces were concentrated on completing the [[Philippines campaign (1944–45)|recapture of the Philippines]], as a stepping stone to an invasion of [[Japan]]. 1TAF was used increasingly in a [[close air support]] role, attacking Japanese bases on islands bypassed by MacArthur's forces.<ref name="Stephens">Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 123–24.</ref> [[Chief of Air Force|Chief of the Air Staff]] [[Air Vice Marshal]] [[George Jones (aviator)|George Jones]] would later contend that the RAAF, in the words of Air Force historian Alan Stephens, "was 'side-stepped' out of the final victory over Japan by Douglas MacArthur, who wanted all the glory for himself".<ref>Stephens, Ibid, p. 109.</ref> This feeling was shared by the aviators of the [[United States Marine Corps]], who formed the [[AirSols|Air North Solomons]] command; they also believed that MacArthur's headquarters was favouring the USAAF in the assignment of combat duties.<ref>*{{cite book|last=Garand| first=George W.| coauthors=Strobridge, Truman R. |year=1971| title=History of U.S. Marine Corps: Operations in World War II. Volume IV: Western Pacific Operations | location=Arlington, Virginia| publisher=U.S. Marine Corps | pages=p. 389}}  </ref>

The overall situation led to dissatisfaction and poor morale amongst 1TAF personnel based on [[Morotai]], particularly the Spitfire pilots who had little opportunity for air-to-air combat and whose aircraft were ill-suited to ground attack missions.<ref name="Helson">Helson, ''"Ten Years at the Top"'', pp. 207–15.</ref> Group Captain Wilfred Arthur produced a "balance sheet" to demonstrate that unit losses were not justified by the damage inflicted on enemy targets, or by the relative importance of those targets.<ref name="Odgers">Odgers, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 122–23.</ref> Arthur presented the balance sheet to Air Commodore Cobby, who reviewed it but did not take any action.<ref name="Alexander">Alexander, ''Clive Caldwell'', pp. 185–200.</ref><ref name="Watson">Watson, ''Killer Caldwell'', pp. 186–90.</ref> Arthur then began discussing his concerns with Caldwell and a number of other senior pilots in 1TAF.

==The "mutiny"==
On [[19 April]] [[1945]],<ref name="Stephens"/> Caldwell, Arthur and six other pilots, including two celebrated aces, [[Wing Commander]] [[Bobby Gibbes]] and [[Squadron Leader]] John Waddy,<ref>Odgers, Op Cit, p.125. Caldwell's final tally for the war was 28.5 kills, Waddy's 15.5, Gibbes' 10.25, and Arthur's 10.</ref> presented Cobby with identically-worded letters protesting the relegation of 1TAF to "senseless unimportant ground targets" and requesting permission to resign their commissions.<ref name="Watson"/><ref>[http://www.awm.gov.au/people/142.asp Australian War Memorial (2005). Air Commodore Arthur Henry (Harry) Cobby, CBE, DSO, DFC, GM]</ref> Cobby refused to accept their resignations and contacted his immediate superior, [[Air Vice Marshal]] [[William Bostock]], head of RAAF Command, the air force's main operational formation. Bostock interviewed the pilots and asked them to tear up the letters, without success.<ref name="Helson"/>

Bostock signalled Jones, advising that he found morale in 1TAF to be at a "dangerously low level" and recommending that Jones fire Cobby and replace him with Air Commodore [[Frederick Scherger]].<ref name="Helson"/><ref name="Odgers"/> Jones considered the pilots' action "absurd" due to the technicality that an officer could not legally resign during wartime, but he travelled to Morotai to investigate the matter personally. He also interviewed the pilots, later indicating that he believed they were acting honestly but out of a misguided concept of duty.<ref name="Helson"/>

Kenney also became embroiled in the affair, insisting on speaking directly to the pilots himself, over Jones' protest that this was an RAAF disciplinary matter. Kenney tried to persuade the officers to drop the attempt to resign but again they refused. He agreed with Bostock that Cobby should be replaced by Scherger, and declared that if the pilots were court-martialled then he would appear in their defence. Jones dismissed not only Cobby but his staff officers, Group Captains Gibson and Simms, and Scherger later took over as [[Air Officer Commanding]] 1TAF.<ref name="Stephens"/>

==Aftermath==
In the event, no court-martial took place for any actions directly related to the "mutiny", and all the pilots except Caldwell continued on operations until the end of the war. An RAAF investigation found that Jones' removal of Cobby was justified.<ref name="Stephens"/> The Australian Government set up an inquiry into events on Morotai headed by Justice John Vincent Barry. Commencing on [[16 May]] [[1945]],<ref name="Watson1">Watson, Op. Cit., pp. 228–39.</ref> the inquiry focused on both the resignations and reports of illegal trafficking in alcohol between RAAF and U.S. service personnel on the island.<ref name="Stephens"/>

The complete findings of the inquiry were not published but a summary report was issued on [[14 September]] [[1945]].<ref name="Watson1"/> Judge Barry vindicated Arthur's "balance sheet" and the stand taken by the pilots, finding that their motives in tendering their resignations were sincere.<ref name="Helson"/><ref name="Alexander"/><ref name="Watson1"/> No further action was taken against them over the "mutiny" itself, but Caldwell and Gibbes were subsequently court martialled for their involvement in the alcohol racket and reduced to the rank of [[Flight Lieutenant]].<ref name="Stephens"/><ref name="Watson1"/><ref>{{cite journal

Although news of the resignations, the alcohol racket, and Caldwell's court martial were widely reported, the action did not become popularly known as the "Morotai Mutiny" until years later. The phrase dated back to the earliest days of the incident, Group Captain Arthur having written it at the top of an aide memoire. Shortly after writing it he crossed out "Morotai" and added a question mark following "Mutiny". The term was not released to the public at the time but Arthur's original words have been credited as the source of the name by which the incident eventually became known.<ref name="Alexander"/>
