'''Amazing Grace''' is a [[fictional]] [[extraterrestial]] [[supervillain]] published by [[DC Comics]]. She first appeared in ''[[Superman]]'' vol. 2 #3 (March 1987), and was created by [[John Byrne]].

==Fictional character biography==
Amazing Grace lives among the lowlies of [[Apokolips]]. A loyal agent of [[Darkseid]], she pretends to preach opposition to Darkseid's word and 
encourages them to revolt. When they do, they are easily defeated, thereby crushing their revolt and their spirits. 

When [[Superman]] infiltrated Apokolips, trying to prove he was behind [[Glorious Godfrey|G. Gordon Godfrey's]] reign of terror on Earth, Grace was "captured" by Darkseid's troops and was to be thrown into the firepits; all to lure Superman out. He saved her, but he himself fell into the firepits. He survived, but with no memory or powers. It was implied that Grace seduced Superman on behalf of Darkseid, and convinced the Man of Steel that he was Darkseid's son. Superman was given his powers back when he allied himself with Darkseid, and he battled [[Orion (comics)|Orion]], during which his memory came back. Grace still serves Darkseid among the denizens of Apokolips today.

==Powers and abilities==
Like her brother [[Glorious Godfrey]], Grace is a master of mind manipulation, who uses those powers to subtly influence others.
