'''Suharto''', also spelled '''Soeharto''' ([[June 8]], [[1921]] &ndash; [[January 27]], [[2008]]) was an [[Indonesia]]n military leader, and the second [[President of Indonesia]], holding the office from 1967 to 1998.

Suharto was born in a small village near [[Yogyakarta]], during the era of [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial control]]. His [[Javanese people|ethnic Javanese]] peasant parents divorced not long after his birth, and he passed between several foster parents for much of his childhood. After a brief and an unsuccessful stint as a village bank clerk, Suharto joined the [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army]] in 1940. During the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia]], Suharto served in various Japanese-organised Indonesian security forces. He joined the newly formed Indonesian army during [[Indonesian National Revolution|Indonesia's independence struggle]] where he rose through the ranks to command a garrison against [[Operatie Kraai|Dutch offensives]] at the Republican capital of Yogyakarta. Following Indonesian independence, Suharto rose to the rank of Major General. 

[[30 September Movement|An attempted coup]] on [[30 September]] [[1965]] was countered by Suharto-led troops.<ref>Friend (2003), pages 107–109; {{cite video | people =Chris Hilton (writer and director) | title =Shadowplay | medium =Television documentary | publisher =Vagabond Films and Hilton Cordell Productions | date = 2001 }}; Ricklefs (1991), pages 280–283, 284, 287–290</ref> The Suharto-led army blamed the attempt on the [[Indonesian Communist Party]], which was subsequently outlawed, and led [[Indonesian killings of 1965–66|a violent anti-communist purge]], which is thought to have killed over half a million people. [[Transition to the New Order|Suharto wrested power]] from the weakened incumbent and founding president, [[Sukarno]], and was inaugurated President in March 1968. Popular, military and political support in Indonesia for Suharto's 32-year presidency eroded dramatically following the devastating effect of the [[Asian financial crisis|1997–98 Asian financial crisis]] on Indonesia's economy and standard of living. Suharto was forced to resign from the presidency in May 1998 following [[Indonesian revolution of 1998|mass demonstrations and violence]]. Suharto lived his post-presidential years in near seclusion, and died at the age of 86 in Jakarta in 2008.

The legacy of Suharto's 32-year presidency is debated both in Indonesia and abroad. Under his "[[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]]" administration, Suharto constructed a strong centralised and military-dominated government. An ability to maintain stability over a sprawling and diverse Indonesia, and an avowedly anti-Communist stance, won him the economic and diplomatic support of the West during the [[Cold War]]. For most of his presidency, Indonesia experienced significant economic growth and industrialization,<ref>{{cite conference

==Military career==
===World War II and Japanese occupation===
{{seealso|Japanese occupation of Indonesia}}
After a brief stint in a clerical job at a village bank (from which he was forced to resign after a bicycle mishap tore his only working clothes),<ref>McDonald (1980), pages 12–13</ref> followed by a spell of unemployment, Suharto joined the [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army]] (KNIL) in 1940, and studied in a Dutch-run military school in [[Gombong]] near Yogyakarta. With the Netherlands under German occupation and the Japanese pressing for access to Indonesian oil supplies, the ranks of the KNIL had been opened to large intakes of previously excluded Javanese.<ref>McDonald (1980), pages 13</ref>

After graduation, Suharto was assigned to Battalion XIII at Rampal. His service there was unextraordinary, but for his contracting [[malaria]] requiring hospitalization while on guard duty, and then gaining promotion to [[sergeant]].<ref name="ELSON2">{{cite book | first = Robert E. | last = Elson | year = 2001 | title = Suharto: A Political Biography  | pages=8 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, United Kingdom | id = 052177326}}</ref>

The March 1942 invasion of Imperial Japanese forces was initially welcomed by many Indonesians as a key step towards independence and Suharto was one of thousands of Indonesians who volunteered for Japanese organised security forces.<ref>McDonald (1980), pages 13</ref> He first joined the Japanese sponsored police force at the rank of ''keibuho'' (assistant inspector), where he claimed to have gained his first experience in the intelligence work so central to his presidency{{Fact|date=January 2008}} ("Criminal matters became a secondary problem," Suharto remarked, "what was most important were matters of a political kind").<ref name="OUDANG">{{cite book | first = R. | last = Oudang | year = 1954 | title = Perkembangan kepolisian di Indonesia  | pages=36 | publisher=Mahabarata | location = Jakarta}}</ref>

Suharto shifted from police work toward the Japanese-sponsored militia, the Peta (Defenders of the Fatherland) in which Indonesians served as officers. In his training to serve at the rank of ''shodancho'' (platoon commander) he encountered a localized version of the Japanese ''[[bushido]]'', or "way of the warrior", used to indoctrinate troops. This training encouraged an anti-Dutch and pro-nationalist thought, although toward the aims of the Imperial Japanese militarists. The encounter with a nationalistic and militarist ideology is believed to have profoundly influenced Suharto's own way of thinking.<ref name="ELSON3">{{cite book | first = R.E. | last = Elson | year = 2001 | title = Suharto: A Political Biography  | pages = 9 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, United Kingdom | id = 052177326}}</ref>

The Japanese turned ex-NCOs, including Suharto, into officers and gave them further military education, including lessons in the use of the samurai sword. Suharto's biographer, O.G. Roeder, records in ''The Smiling General'' (1969) that Suharto was "well known for his tough, but not brutal, methods".

===Indonesian National Revolution===
{{seealso|Indonesian National Revolution}}
The [[Victory over Japan Day|Japanese surrender]] to the Allies in World War II brought forth the opportunity for the leaders of the Indonesian Nationalist cause [[Sukarno]] and [[Mohammad Hatta]] to hastily declare the complete independence of Indonesia and the beginning of the [[Indonesian National Revolution]]. International recognition of Indonesia's sovereignty, however, would only come after armed action &mdash; a task at which Suharto would prove himself adept.

====Expulsion of the Japanese====
The Japanese surrender left Suharto in a position to create a name for himself as a part of the military effort to first expel the remaining Japanese forces, and to prepare nationalist forces for the Dutch attempt to retake their former colonial possessions in the archipelago. He became a deputy to [[Umar Slamet]] in the service of the revolutionary government's People's Security Body (BKR).

Suharto claims to have led a number of attacks against remaining Japanese forces around Yogyakarta. The central role he commonly portrayed himself playing in his reminisces on the period during his presidency is debatable; however, it may be acknowledged that Suharto's familiarity with military functioning helped in the organization of the disparate independence forces into a unified fighting force. In the early years of the War, Suharto organized local armed forces into Battalion X of Regiment I; Suharto was promoted to the rank of Major and became Battalion X's leader.<ref name="ELSON4">{{cite book | first = R.E. | last = Elson | year = 2001 | title = Suharto: A Political Biography  | pages = 14–15 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, United Kingdom | id = 052177326}}</ref>

====Return of the Dutch====
The arrival of the Allies, under a mandate to return the situation to the ''[[status quo ante bellum]]'', quickly led to clashes between Suharto's Division X and returning Dutch forces, bolstered by [[Gurkha]]s in the employ of Great Britain. Political differences within both the Allies and the civilian Nationalist forces caused the conflict to alternate in intensity from the end of 1945 into first months of 1946, as negotiations went on between the leaderships of the Indonesian Nationalists and the Dutch in between periods of fighting. In this muddle, Suharto led his troops toward halting an advance by the Dutch T ("Tiger") Brigade on [[May 17]] [[1946]]. It earned Suharto the respect of his superior, Lieutenant Colonel Sunarto Kusumodirjo, who invited him to draft the working guidelines for the Battle Leadership Headquarters (MPP), a body created to organize and unify the command structure of the Indonesian Nationalist forces.<ref name="ELSON5">{{cite book | first = R.E. | last = Elson | year = 2001 | title = Suharto: A Political Biography  | pages = 15–17 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, United Kingdom | id = 052177326}}</ref>

The military forces of the still infant Republic of Indonesia were constantly restructuring. By August 1946, Suharto was head of the 22nd Regiment of Division III (the "[[Diponegoro]]" Division) stationed in Yogyakarta. In late 1946 the Diponegoro Division became responsible for defense of the west and south-west of [[Yogyakarta]] from Dutch forces. Conditions at the time are reported in Dutch sources as miserable; Suharto himself is reported as assisting smuggling syndicates in the transport of [[opium]] through the territory he controlled, in order to make income.

<!-- IS THIS RELEVANT? HOW DOES IT FIT:
In 1947, the Dutch initiated ''[[Operatie Product|Operation Product]]'', the first of two [[Politionele acties|major military offensives]] recapturing much Republican held territory. A cease fire was brokered by the [[United Nations]]. -->
Suharto was married to [[Siti Hartinah]], a woman from a high class family that, in the years of the revolution, lost its prestige and income. Over the next 17 years the couple would have six children: [[Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana]] (Tutut, born 1949), [[Sigit Harjojudanto]] (born 1951), [[Bambang Trihatmodjo]] (born 1953), [[Siti Hediati]] (Titiek, born 1959), [[Hutomo Mandala Putra]] (Tommy, born 1962), and [[Siti Hutami Endang Adiningsih]] (Mamiek, born 1964). Suharto's wife, died in 1996.

''[[Operatie Kraai]]'' ("Operation Crow"), commenced in December 1948 and decimated much of the Indonesian fighting forces, resulting in the capture of Sukarno and Hatta, the civilian leadership of Indonesia. Suharto, for his part, took severe casualties as the Dutch invaded the area of Yogyakarta; the retreat was equally humiliating.<ref name="ELSON6">{{cite book | first = R.E. | last = Elson | year = 2001 | title = Suharto: A Political Biography  | pages = 20–25, 28–29 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, United Kingdom | id = 052177326}}</ref>

====Guerrilla warfare and victory====
It is widely believed that the humiliating nature of this defeat engrained a sense of guilt in Suharto, as well as a sense of obligation to avenge his honor. Suharto, and the aggrieved Indonesian armed forces, attempted to do this by means of [[guerrilla warfare]], using intelligence and supply networks established at the village level. During this time ambushes became a favored tactic; villagers were enlisted to attack Dutch patrols with weapons as primitive as bamboo spears. The desired effect was to remind the populace of the continuing resistance to Dutch rule. However, these attacks were largely ineffective and were often comparable to suicide.

Suharto's efforts to regain the national honor culminated in an attack on Dutch forces at Yogyakarta on [[March 1]] [[1949]]. Suharto would later embellish his role as the singular plotter; according to more objective sources, however, the nationalist Sultan Hamengku Buwono IX (who still remained in power), as well as the Panglima of the Third Division ordered the attack. General Nasution would recall, however, that Suharto took great care in preparing the "General Offensive" ([[Bahasa Indonesia|Indonesian]]" ''Serangan Umum''). 

In a series of daring small-scale raids under cover of darkness and with the support of locals, Suharto's forces captured the city, holding it until noon. The attack yielded some ammunition and a few light arms; as [[propaganda]] and [[psychological warfare]] it had filled the desired effect, however &mdash; civilians sympathetic to the Nationalist cause within the city had been galvanized by the show of force, and internationally, the United Nations took notice, with the Security Council putting pressure on the Dutch to cease Police Action and to re-embark on negotiations. Suharto gained both national and international recognition of his abilities as a military planner.

The return of the Dutch to the negotiating table all but assured, Suharto took an active interest in the peace agreements, though they were much to his dissatisfaction.<ref name="ELSON7">{{cite book | first = R.E. | last = Elson | year = 2001 | title = Suharto: A Political Biography  | pages = 29–38, 42–44 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, United Kingdom | id = 052177326}}</ref>

===Post-Independence military career===
During the following years he served in the [[Military of Indonesia|Indonesian National Army]], stationed primarily on [[Java (island)|Java]]. In 1950, Colonel Suharto led the Garuda Brigade in suppressing a rebellion of largely [[Ambon]]ese colonial-trained supporters of the Dutch-established State of Eastern Indonesia and its federal entity the [[United States of Indonesia]]; the rebellion was led by Andi Azis a former officer of the [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army]] (KNIL).<ref>{{cite book  | last =McDonald  | first =Hamish  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title =Suharto's Indonesia  | publisher =Fontana Books  | date =1980  | location =  | pages =pp. 24–25  | url =  | doi =  | id =ISBN 0-00-635721-0}}</ref> During his one-year stay in Makassar, Suharto became acquainted with his neighbours the Habibie family, whose eldest son [[Jusuf Habibie|BJ Habibie]] would later became Suharto's vice-president and went on to succeed him as President. In 1951, Suharto led his troops in a cautious blocking campaign against the Islamic-inspired rebellion of Battalion 426 in [[Central Java]] before it was broken by the 'Banteng (Wild Buffalo) Raiders' led by [[Ahmad Yani]].<ref>{{cite book  | last =McDonald  | first =Hamish  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title =Suharto's Indonesia  | publisher =Fontana Books  | date =1980  | location =  | pages =p.25  | url =  | doi =  | id =ISBN 0-00-635721-0}}</ref> Between 1954 and 1959, Brigadier General Suharto served in the important position of commander of Diponegoro Division, responsible for Central Java and [[Yogyakarta]] provinces. His relationship with prominent businessmen [[Sudono Salim|Liem Sioe Liong]] and [[Bob Hasan]] began in Central Java where he was involved in series of 'profit generating' enterprises conducted primarily to keep the poorly funded military unit functioning.<ref>{{cite book  | last =McDonald  | first =Hamish  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title =Suharto's Indonesia  | publisher =Fontana Books  | date =1980  | location =  | pages =pp.30–31  | url =  | doi =  | id =ISBN 0-00-635721-0}}</ref> Army anti-corruption investigations implicated Suharto in 1959 smuggling scandal. However, his military career was rescued by Gen. Gatot Subroto; instead of being brought before a court martial, he was transferred to the army Staff College in [[Bandung]], [[West Java]].<ref>{{cite book  | last =McDonald  | first =Hamish  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title =Suharto's Indonesia  | publisher =Fontana Books  | date =1980  | location =  | pages =pp.31–32  | url =  | doi =  | id =ISBN 0-00-635721-0}}</ref> 

In 1962 he was promoted to the rank of [[major general]] and was appointed to lead the [[Mandala Command]], a joint army-navy-air force umbrella command headquartered in Makassar, that organised military incursions in [[Netherlands New Guinea]], after this country had elected a council and adopted a [[Flag of West Papua|flag]] and anthem in preparation of independence. Diplomatic pressure by the US, which feared Indonesia would otherwise ally with the Soviet Union, led the Netherlands to sign the [[New York Agreement]] that transferred sovereignty of [[Western New Guinea]] to Indonesia. After this, Suharto was appointed commander of ''[[Kostrad]]'' (Strategic Reserve), a sizeable army [[combat]] force, which most importantly had significant presence in the [[Jakarta]] area.

==Overthrow of Sukarno (1965)==
{{main|Transition to the New Order}}

===Background===
{{seealso|Guided Democracy (1957–1965)}}
Described as the great ''dalang'' ("puppet master"), President Sukarno's position came to depend on balancing the opposing and increasingly hostile forces of the army and [[Communist Party of Indonesia]] (PKI). His anti-imperial ideology saw Indonesia increasingly dependent on the Soviet Union and then communist China. By 1965, the PKI penetrated all levels of government extensively, and with the support of Sukarno and the air force, successfully pursued policies to gain influence at the expense of the army, thus ensuring the army's enmity.<ref>Ricklefs (1991), page 282</ref> By late 1965, the army was divided between a left-wing faction allied with the PKI, and a right-wing faction that were being courted from abroad by the United States.<ref>Ricklefs (1991), pages 272–280</ref>

===Abortive coup and anti-communist purge===
{{main|30 September Movement|Indonesian killings of 1965–66}}
[[Image:Suharto at funeral.jpg|thumb|As Major General, Suharto (''at right, foreground'') attends funeral for assassinated generals [[5 October]] 1965. (Photo by the Department of Information, Indonesia)]]

On the night of [[30 September]]–[[1 October]] [[1965]] six senior army generals were kidnapped and executed in Jakarta by a battalion of soldiers from the Presidential Guard in an attempted coup. The left faction among the top generals was wiped out, including the powerful Army Chief of Staff, [[Ahmad Yani]]. The army thus fell to those more willing to stand up to Sukarno and the army's enemies on the left.<ref>Ricklefs (1991), page 281</ref> Backed by elements of the armed forces, the insurgents, known as the [[30 September Movement]], commanded the Presidential Palace opposite Merdeka Square, the national radio station, and telecommunications centre. The group announced on radio that morning that they were trying to stop a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]-backed military coup which was planned to remove Sukarno from power on "Army Day", [[October 5]].

Suharto was the most senior general not removed by the 30 September group,<ref>Vickers (2005), page 156</ref> apart from Armed Forces Chief of Staff, General [[Abdul Harris Nasution]] (who was targeted for assassination but narrowly escaped, and was in hiding). Suharto had no affinity to Sukarno, nor any special Islamic conviction with which to oppose him. He despised disorder, but was known for prizing opportunity, for which General Yani and disciplined him several years before, thus removing affinity there.<ref>Friend (2003), page 104</ref> On the night of 30 September, Suharto had been in hospital preoccupied with a scalding injury to his three-year old son [[Tommy Suharto|Tommy]] where Colonel Abdul Latief was the only principal of ensuing events with whom Suharto spoke that evening.<ref>Friend (2003), page 104</ref>

Upon being told of the disappearance of the generals and shootings, Suharto went to Kostrad headquarters just before dawn from where he could see soldiers occupying Merdeka Square. He led the elite Army Strategic Reserve ([[Kostrad]]) in seizing control of the centre of Jakarta, capturing key strategic sites. Now joined by Nasution, Suharto announced over the radio at 9:00pm that six generals had been kidnapped by "counter-revolutionaries" and that he was in control of the army, and would crush the 30 September Movement and safeguard Sukarno.<ref>Ricklefs (1991), p. 282.</ref> Suharto issued an ultimatum to Halim Air Force Base, where the G30S had based themselves and where Sukarno (the reasons for his presence are unclear and were subject of claim and counter-claim), [[General Omar Dhani]] and Aidit had gathered. The coup leaders fled Jakarta<ref>Ricklefs (1991), page 281–282</ref> while G30S-sympathetic battalions in Central Java quickly came under Suharto control,<ref>Friend (2003), page 105</ref> and it was clear that the incompetently organised and poorly coordinated coup had failed.<ref>Ricklefs (1991), pages 281–282</ref> By 2 October, Suharto's faction was firmly in control of the army. Sukarno's obedience to Suharto's 1 October ultimatum to leave Halim is seen as changing all power relationships.<ref>Friend (2003), page 105</ref> Sukarno's fragile balance of power between the military, political Islam, communists, and nationalists that underlay his "[[Guided Democracy (1957–1965)|Guided Democracy]]" was now collapsing.<ref>Ricklefs (1991), pages 281–282</ref>

In early October, a military propaganda campaign began to sweep the country, successfully convincing both Indonesian and international audiences that it was a Communist coup, and that the murders were cowardly atrocities against Indonesian heroes.<ref>Vickers (2005), page 157</ref> The PKI's denials of involvement had little effect.<ref>Ricklefs (1991), page 287</ref> The army led campaign to purge Indonesian society, government and armed forces of the communist party and other leftist organisations. Leading PKI members were immediately arrested, some summarily executed.<ref>Vickers (2005), page 157</ref> The purge quickly spread from Jakarta to the rest of the country, and the worst massacres were in Java and Bali.<ref>Ricklefs (1991), page 287</ref> (see: [[Indonesian killings of 1965–66]]) The situation varied across the country; in some areas the army organised civilian groups and local militias, in other areas communal vigilante action preceded the army.<ref>Vickers (2005), pages 158–159</ref> The most widely accepted estimates are that at least half a million were killed.<ref>Ricklefs (1991), p. 288; Friend (2003), p. 113; Vickers (2005), p. 159; {{cite journal |title=Unresolved Problems in the Indonesian Killings of 1965–1966 |author=Robert Cribb |journal=Asian Survey |volume=42 |issue=4 |date=2002 |pages=550–563 |doi=10.1525/as.2002.42.4.550}}</ref> A CIA study of the events in Indonesia assessed that ''"In terms of the numbers killed the anti-PKI massacres in Indonesia rank as one of the worst mass murders of the 20th century.."''.<ref name="pki1965">Kahin, George McT. and Kahin, Audrey R.

===Power struggle===
{{seealso|Supersemar}}
By January 1966, President Sukarno's strongest pillar of support had been effectively eliminated, largely by his other two pillars of power, the army and the Muslims. Long wanting to more control of the political system, the army now saw its opportunity to occupy the apex of Indonesian power.<ref>Schwartz (1994), pages 2 & 22</ref> Sukarno was still the Supreme Commander by virtue of the constitution, thus Suharto was careful not to be seen to be seizing power in his own coup. For eighteen months following the quashing of the 30 September Movement, there was a complicated process of political manoeuvers against Sukarno, including student agitation, stacking of parliament, media propaganda and military threats.<ref>Vickers (2005), page 160</ref> 

On [[February 1]] [[1966]], Pres. Sukarno promoted Suharto to the rank of Lieutenant General. The same month, Gen.

===Institutionalisation of the New Order===
{{seealso|Acting Presidency of Suharto}}
[[Image:Suhartoappointedpresident.jpg|thumb|Suharto is appointed president of Indonesia at a ceremony, March 1968. (Photo by the Department of Information, Indonesia)]]Suharto established what he called the [[New Order (Indonesia)|"New Order"]] (''Orde Baru''). In place of Sukarno's revolutionary rhetoric, Suharto showed a pragmatic use of power, and in contrast to the liberal parliamentary democracy of the 1950s, Suharto headed an authoritarian, military-dominated government.<ref>Schwartz (1994), page 2</ref> Economic development and the building of strong government with a resultant weak civil society became defining features of the New Order.<ref>Schwartz (1994), page 3</ref>

Internationally, Suharto put Indonesia on a course toward improved relations with Western nations, while ending its friendly relations with the [[People's Republic of China]]. He dispatched his foreign minister, [[Adam Malik]] to mend strained relations with the [[United States]], [[United Nations]], and [[Malaysia]] and end the [[Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation|Confrontation]]. Indonesia also became a founding member of [[ASEAN]]. Diplomatic ties with the People's Republic of China were eventually restored in 1990.

To maintain domestic order, Suharto greatly expanded the funding and powers of the Indonesian state apparatus. He established two intelligence agencies&mdash;the Operational Command for the Restoration of Security and Order (KOPKAMTIB) and the State Intelligence Coordination Agency (BAKIN)&mdash;to deal with threats to the regime. Suharto also established the [[BULOG|Bureau of Logistics (BULOG)]] to distribute [[rice]] and other staple commodities granted by [[USAID]]. These new government bodies were put under the military regional command structure, that under Suharto was given a "dual function" as both a defense force and as civilian administrators.

Suharto became a strong advocate for Chinese assimilation rather than integration. As part of 1967's 'Basic Policy for the Solution of the Chinese Problem' and other measures, all but one Chinese-language papers were closed, all Chinese religious expressions had to be confined to their homes, Chinese-language schools were phased out, Chinese script in public places was banned, and Chinese were encouraged to take on [[Indonesian-sounding names adopted by Chinese Indonesians|Indonesian-sounding names]].<ref>Schwartz (1994), page 106</ref> Most of this legislation were revoked following Suharto's fall from power in 1998.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}

===Economic Matters===
President Suharto relied on a group of American-educated economists, nicknamed the "[[Berkeley Mafia]]," to set economic policy. Soon after coming to power, he passed a number of reforms meant to establish Indonesia as a center of foreign investment. These included the privatization of its [[natural resources]] to promote investment by industrialized nations, labour laws favorable to multinational corporations, and soliciting funds for development from institutions including the [[World Bank]], Western banks, and friendly governments.<ref name="IND_ECON">{{cite web | title=Indonesia Economic | work=Commanding Heights | url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/lo/countries/id/id_economic.html | publisher=PBS/WBGH | accessdaymonth=May 23 | accessyear=2005}}</ref> Suharto brought a shift in policy from firebrand Sukarno that allowed for [[USAID]] and other relief agencies to resume operations within the country. Suharto would open Indonesia's economy by divesting state owned companies, and Western nations in particular were encouraged to invest and take control of many of the mining and construction interests in Indonesia. 

Within a few years, the Indonesian economy was revived from its near collapsed state of the mid-1960s. It grew by an average 7 per cent for 25 years, reducing the proportion of Indonesians in the "very poor" category from 65% in the mid-1960s to 7% in 1990, (although much of these gains would be lost in the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis). Suharto established Indonesian self-sufficiency in rice production by the mid-1980s, extended basic education to almost all citizens and implemented a successful family planning program.<ref name="SMH_McDONALD"/>

As virtually unchecked forces in Indonesian society under the New Order, however, members of the military and Golkar Party were heavily involved as intermediaries between businesses (foreign and domestic) and the Indonesian government. This led to bribery, racketeering, and embezzlement. Funds from these practices often flowed to foundations (''yayasan'') controlled by the Suharto family.<ref name="KKN">{{cite news | first=Brendan

===Unitary state and regional unrest===
[[Image:SuhartoNAMLusaka1970.jpg|thumb|As Indonesian President, Suharto attends 1970 meeting of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] in [[Lusaka, Zambia]]. (Photo by the State Secretariat, Indonesia)]]

From his assumption of office until his resignation, Suharto continued Sukarno's policy of asserting Indonesian sovereignty. He acted zealously to stake and enforce territorial claims over much of the region, through both diplomacy and military action.  

In 1969, Suharto moved to end the longtime controversy over the last Dutch territory in the East Indies, [[western New Guinea]]. Working with the [[United States]] and [[United Nations]], an agreement was made to hold a referendum on self-determination, in which participants could choose to remain part of the Netherlands, to integrate with the Republic of Indonesia, or to become independent. Though originally phrased to be a nationwide vote of all adult Papuans, the "[[Act of Free Choice]]" was held July&ndash;August 1969 allowed only 1022 "chiefs" to vote. The unanimous vote was for integration with the Republic of Indonesia, leading to doubts of the validity of the vote.<ref name="NSArch_Simpson">{{cite news | last=Simpson | first=Brad  | title=Indonesia's 1969 Takeover of West Papua Not by "Free Choice" | date=[[July 9]] [[2004]] | publisher=National Security Archive | url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB128/index.htm}}</ref>

In 1975, after [[Portugal]] withdrew from its colony of [[East Timor]] and the [[Fretilin]] movement momentarily took power, Suharto ordered troops to invade East Timor. Later the [[puppet government]] installed by Indonesia requested the area be annexed to the country. A detailed statistical report prepared for the [[Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation in East Timor]] estimated a minimum of 102,800 conflict-related deaths in the period 1974–1999, namely, approximately 18,600 killings and 84,200 'excess' deaths from hunger and illness.<ref>{{cite web |author=Benetech Human Rights Data Analysis Group |title=The Profile of Human Rights Violations in Timor-Leste, 1974–1999 |work=A Report to the Commission on Reception, Truth and Reconciliation of Timor-Leste |publisher=Human Rights Data Analysis Group (HRDAG) |date=[[9 February]] [[2006]] |url=http://www.hrdag.org/resources/timor_chapter_graphs/timor_chapter_page_02.shtml}}</ref> On [[July 15]] [[1976]] Suharto's "New Order" declared East Timor the 27th province of Indonesia. Following Suharto's 1998 resignation from the Presidency, East Timor voted for independence in 1999 and was transferred to United Nations administration.

In 1976, the regime was challenged in the province of [[Aceh]] by the formation of the [[Free Aceh Movement]], or GAM, who demanded independence from the unitary state. Suharto quickly authorized troops to put down the rebellion, forcing several of its leaders into exile in [[Sweden]]. Prolonged fighting between GAM and the Indonesian military and police led Suharto to declare martial law in the province, by naming Aceh a "military operational area" (DOM) in 1990.

The rapid pace of this development had vastly increased their population density. In response, Suharto pursued the policy of [[Transmigration program|transmigration]] to promote movement from crowded cities to rural regions of the archipelago where [[natural resources]] had not yet been exploited.

===Politics and dissent===
[[Image:William cohen with suharto.jpg|thumb|Suharto with [[U.S. Secretary of Defense]] [[William Cohen]], January 14, 1998. ]]

In 1970, corruption prompted student protests and an investigation by a government commission. Suharto responded by banning student protests, forcing the activists underground. Only token prosecution of the cases recommended by the commission was pursued. The pattern of co-opting a few of his more powerful opponents while criminalising the rest became a hallmark of Suharto's rule.

In order to maintain a veneer of democracy, Suharto made a number of electoral reforms. According to his electoral rules, however, only three parties were allowed to participate in the election: his own [[Golkar]] party; the Islamist [[United Development Party]] (PPP); and the [[Indonesian Democratic Party]] (PDI). All the previously existing political parties were forced to be part of either the PPP and PDI, with public servants under pressure to join Golkar. In a political compromise with the powerful military, he banned its members from voting in elections, but set aside 100 seats in the electoral college for their representatives. As a result, he was unopposed for reelection as president in 1973, 1978, 1983, 1988, 1993, and 1998.

On [[May 5]] [[1980]] a group of prominent military men, politicians, academics and students calling themselves the "[[Petition of Fifty]]" questioned Suharto's use of the national ideology ''[[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]].'' The Indonesian media suppressed the news and the government placed restrictions on the signatories. After the group's 1984 accusation that Suharto was creating a [[one-party state]], some of its leaders were jailed.{{Fact|date=May 2008}}

In the same decade, it is believed by many scholars that the Indonesian military split between a nationalist "red and white faction" and an Islamist "green faction." As the 1980s closed, Suharto is said to have been forced to shift his alliances from the former to the latter, leading to the rise of [[Jusuf Habibie]] in the 1990s.

After the 1990s brought end of the Cold War, Western concern over communism waned, and Suharto's human rights record came under greater international scrutiny. The [[Santa Cruz massacre|1991 killing of over 200 East Timorese civilians]] in [[Dili]], East Timor, resulted in the [[Congress of the United States]] passing limitations on [[IMET]] assistance to the Indonesian military.<ref name="HR_IMET">{{cite web | title=H.AMDT.647 (A003): An amendment to prohibit any funds appropriated in the bill to be used for military education and training assistance to Indonesia | url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d102:HZ00647: | publisher=THOMAS (Library of Congress) | accessdate=2006-02-04}}</ref> In 1993, under President [[Bill Clinton]], the U.S. delegation to the [[UN Human Rights Commission]] helped pass a resolution expressing deep concern over Indonesian human rights violations in East Timor.<ref name="UNHCHR">{{cite web | title= United Nations High Commission on Human Rights resolution 1993/97: Situation in East Timor | url=http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/0/81427c9bacaf9847c1256c6800603ff2?Opendocument | publisher=United Nations | accessdate=2006-02-04}}

===Resignation===
{{seealso|Indonesian Revolution of 1998}}
In 1996 Suharto was challenged by a split over the leadership of the [[Indonesian Democratic Party]] (PDI), a legal party that propped up the regime. [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]], the daughter of [[Sukarno]], had become PDI's chairwoman and was increasingly critical of Suharto's regime. In response, Suharto backed a co-opted faction led by Deputy Speaker of Parliament [[Suryadi]]. The Suryadi faction announced a party congress to sack Megawati would be held in [[Medan]] from June 20 - June 22. 

In response, Megawati proclaimed that if sacked, her supporters would hold demonstrations in protest. The Suryadi faction went through with its sacking of Megawati, and the demonstrations manifested themselves throughout Indonesia. This led to several confrontations on the streets between protesters and security forces. A deal was eventually made with the military to allow Megawati's supporters to take over PDI headquarters in Jakarta, in exchange for a pledge of no further demonstrations. During this time, Megawati supporters organized "democracy forums" at the site, with several activists making speeches denouncing Suharto and his regime.<ref name="ASPINALL">{{cite news | last=Aspinall | first=Ed | title=What happened before the riots? | date= October–December 1996 | publisher=Inside Indonesia | url=http://www.insideindonesia.org/edit48/ed.htm}}</ref>

After one month of this, police, soldiers, and persons claiming to be Suryadi supporters stormed the headquarters, killing Megawati supporters and arresting two-hundred. Those arrested were tried under the Anti-Subversion and Hate-spreading laws.<ref name="AMNESTYREP">{{cite news | title=Indonesia: Arrests, torture and intimidation: The Government's response to its critics | date=   [[November 27]] [[1996]] | publisher=[[Amnesty International]] | url=http://web.amnesty.org/library/eng-idn/index&start=391}}</ref> The day would become known as "Black Saturday" {{Fact|date=January 2008}} and mark the beginning of a renewed crackdown by the New Order government against supporters of democracy, now called the "Reformasi" or Reformation.

The [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis]] had dire consequences for the Indonesian economy and society, and Suharto's regime. The Indonesian [[currency]], the [[rupiah]], took a sharp dive in value. Suharto came under scrutiny from international lending institutions, chiefly the [[World Bank]], [[IMF]] and the [[United States]], over longtime embezzlement of funds and some [[protectionist]] policies. In December, Suharto's government signed a letter of intent to the [[IMF]], pledging to enact [[austerity]] measures, including cuts to public services and removal of [[subsidies]], in return for receiving the aid of the [[IMF]] and other donors.<ref>Vickers (2005), pp. 203–207.</ref>

Beginning in early 1998, the [[austerity]] measures approved by Suharto had started to erode domestic confidence in the regime. Prices for [[commodities]] such as kerosene and rice, and fees for public services including education rose dramatically. The effects were exacerbated by widespread corruption. 

{{wikisource|Suharto's Resignation Speech}}
Suharto stood for reelection for the seventh time in March 1998, justifying it on the grounds of the necessity of his leadership during the crisis. As in past years, he was unopposed for reelection. This sparked protests and riots throughout the country, now termed the [[Indonesian Revolution of 1998]]. Dissension within the ranks of his own Golkar party and military finally weakened Suharto, and on [[May 21]] [[1998]] he stood down from power. He was replaced by his deputy [[Jusuf Habibie]].<ref>Vickers (2005), pp. 203–207.</ref>

==Post-presidency==
[[Image:TIMEasia Suharto.gif|thumb|upright|After his fall from the presidency, Suharto's secret fortune began to be publicized in the press.]]

After his resignation, Suharto retired to a family compound in Central Jakarta, making few public appearances. Efforts to prosecute Suharto have mostly centered around alleged mismanagement of funds, and their force has been blunted due to health concerns. Suharto was never prosecuted.

===Investigations of wealth===
In May 1999, a [[Time (magazine)|''Time Asia'']] estimated Suharto's family fortune at US$15 billion in cash, [[shares]], corporate assets, real estate, jewelry and fine art. Of this, US$9 billion is reported to have been deposited in an [[Austria]]n bank. The family is said to control about 36,000 km² of real estate in Indonesia, including 100,000 m² of prime office space in Jakarta and nearly 40 percent of the land in East Timor. Over US$73 billion is said to have passed through the family's hands during Suharto's 32-year rule. 

On [[May 29]] [[2000]], Suharto was placed under [[house arrest]] when Indonesian authorities began to investigate the corruption during his regime. In July 2000, it was announced that he was to be accused of embezzling US$571 million of government donations to one of a number of foundations under his control and then using the money to finance family investments. But in September court-appointed doctors announced that he could not stand trial because of his declining health. State prosecutors tried again in 2002 but then doctors cited an unspecified brain disease.

According to [[Transparency International]], Suharto [[embezzlement|embezzled]] more money than any other world leader in history with an estimated US $15&ndash;35 billion embezzlement during his 32 years rule.<ref name=TISuharto>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3567745.stm | title=Suharto tops corruption rankings | publisher=BBC News | date= [[25 March]] [[2004]] | accessdate=2006-02-04}}</ref>

On [[March 26]], 2008, civil court judge Wahyono acquitted Suharto of corruption but ordered his charitable foundation Supersemar to pay $110m (£55m).<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7315976.stm  bbc.co.uk, Suharto charity told to pay $110m]</ref>

===Related legal cases===
Unable to legally prosecute Suharto, the state has instead pursued legal actions against his former subordinates and members of his family. Suharto's son Hutomo Mandala Putra, more widely known as [[Tommy Suharto]], was initially sentenced to 15 years in jail for [[Contract killing|arranging the murder]] of a judge who sentenced him to 18 months for his role in a land scam in September 2000. He became the first member of the Suharto family to be found guilty and jailed for a criminal offence. Tommy Suharto maintained his innocence, and won a reduction of his sentence to ten years in June 2005. On October 30, 2006, he was freed on "conditional release."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6098010.stm BBC]</ref>

In 2003, Suharto's half-brother Probosutedjo was tried and convicted for corruption and the loss of $10 million from the Indonesian state. He was sentenced to four years in jail. He later won a reduction of his sentence to two years, initiating a probe by the Indonesian Corruption Eradication Commission into the alleged scandal of the "judicial mafia" which uncovered offers of $600,000 to various judges. Probosutedjo confessed to the scheme in October 2005, leading to the arrest of his lawyers. His full four year term was reinstated. After a brief standoff at a hospital, in which he was reportedly protected by a group of police officers, he was arrested on November 30, 2005.

On July 9, 2007, Indonesian prosecutors filed a civil lawsuit against former President Suharto, to recover state funds ($440m or £219m, which allegedly disappeared from a scholarship fund, and a further $1.1 billion in damages).<ref name="BBC_9July">{{cite news | title= Civil suit filed against Suharto | date= [[9 July]] [[2007]] | publisher=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6283322.stm}}</ref>

On September 4, 2007, [[mediation]] at the Attorney General's Office (AGO) between prosecutors and lawyers for Suharto over the [[Supersemar]] foundation civil lawsuit succeeded and thus the trial will have to commence.<ref>[http://www.thejakartapost.com/detailheadlines.asp?fileid=20070905.A07&irec=6  Jakartapost.com, Mediation fails, Soeharto civil trial continues]</ref>

On September 10, 2007, Indonesia's Supreme Court awarded Suharto [[damages]] against ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Asia]]'' [[Newsmagazine|magazine]], ordering it to pay him one trillion [[Indonesian rupiah|rupiah]] ($128.59 million). The High Court reversed the [[judgment]] of an [[appellate court]] and [[Central Jakarta]] [[district court]] (made in 2000 and 2001). Suharto had [[Lawsuit|sued]] the U.S.-based ''Time'' magazine seeking more than $US 27 billion in damages for [[libel]] over a 1999 article which reported that he transferred stolen money abroad.<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22396808-5005961,00.html  News.com.au, Suharto wins $128m in damages]</ref>

===Health crises===
After resigning from the presidency, Suharto was hospitalized repeatedly for [[Cerebrovascular accident|stroke]], heart, and intestinal problems. His declining health negatively affected the many attempts to prosecute Suharto on charges of corruption and human rights violations, as his lawyers successfully claimed that his condition rendered him unfit for trial. 

On [[May 6]] [[2005]], Suharto was taken to Pertamina Hospital in Jakarta with intestinal bleeding, believed to be from [[diverticulosis]]. The political elite of Indonesia, including President [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] and Vice President [[Jusuf Kalla]], visited his bedside. He was released and returned home, [[May 12]] [[2005]].

On [[May 26]] [[2005]], the [[Jakarta Post]] reported that amid an effort by the government of President [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] to crack down on corruption, Indonesian Attorney General Abdurrahman Saleh appeared before a Parliamentary commission to discuss efforts to prosecute New Order figures, including Suharto. Attorney General Abdurrahman remarked that he hoped Suharto could recover so that the government could begin inquiries into New Order human rights violations and corruption for purposes of compensation and recovery of state funds, but expressed skepticism that this would be possible. As a result, the Supreme Court of Indonesia has issued a decree making the office of the Attorney General responsible for supervising Suharto's medical care.

On [[April 24]] [[2006]], Attorney General Abdurrahman announced that a team of twenty doctors would be asked to evaluate Suharto's health and fitness for trial. One physician, Brigadier General Dr Marjo Subiandono, stated his doubts about by noting that "[Suharto] has two permanent cerebral defects."<ref name="AP">{{cite news | title=Former Indonesian dictator unfit to stand trial &mdash; doctor | date= [[April 23]] [[2006]] | publisher=Associated Press | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/former-indonesian-dictator-unfit-to-stand-trial--doctor/2006/04/22/1145344319571.html}}</ref> In a later [[Financial Times]] report, Attorney General Abdurrahman discussed the re-examination, and called it part of a "last opportunity" to prosecute Suharto criminally.

On [[May 4]] [[2006]], Suharto was again admitted to Pertamina Hospital for intestinal bleeding.
