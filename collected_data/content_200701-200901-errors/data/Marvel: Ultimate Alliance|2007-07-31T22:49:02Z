'''''Marvel: Ultimate Alliance''''' is an [[action role-playing game]], previously referred to as '''Marvel Legends''', the game is set within the [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]] and features appearances from many of the superheroes, [[supervillain]]s and supporting [[character]]s that feature within the [[comic book]]s published by Marvel, with 140 character appearances in total. 

==Story==
The game starts off with [[Doctor Doom|Dr. Doom]] having formed a new [[Masters of Evil]] in pursuit of becoming a god. They launch an attack on [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[helicarrier]] U.N.N. Alpha and [[Nick Fury]] sends out a distress call to all available super heroes. [[Captain America]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Spider-Man]] and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] are seen responding to the call. After saving the helicarrier, Nick Fury is given permission to start a task force to fight this new threat and [[Iron Man]] gives them permission to use Stark Tower since the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier U.N.N. Alpha is damaged.

Their first mission after the hellicarrier is set on the Omega Base from which they have received an odd message. The player must fight through awakened Super Soldiers, [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]] and the supervillains [[MODOK|M.O.D.O.K.]], [[Crimson Dynamo]], and [[Mysterio]] so that they can prevent the Omega Base from crashing in to a dam, as well as stop several gamma bombs from launching.

The player's next mission takes them to Atlantis, with the help of nano-technology that enables them to breath and move freely underwater, where the inhabitants are being mind controlled by [[Attuma]] who has ursupped [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] from his throne. After defeating the evil ursuper, The [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] is seen working for the Masters of Evil, deep in the catacombs. He escapes with the "Tome of Asarius", but unleashes the [[Kraken (Marvel Comics)|Kraken]], whom the player must defeat. The player is then sent to The Valley of Spirits to confront the Mandarin, where they encounter and recruit [[Doctor Strange|Dr. Strange]]. After finding and defeating the Mandarin, he reveals that he had not been in Atlantis and suggests that the Mandarin they saw in the catacombs was [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], God of Mischief.

The player's "home-base" is then moved to Dr. Strange's Sanctum. The team learns that [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] has been kidnapped and that he has tracked to Castle Doom, but upon trying to transport there they are sent to Murderworld. After defeating [[Arcade (comics)|Arcade]], the heroes learn from him that Dr. Doom has used Nightcrawler to gain access to [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]'s Realm. The team is sent to Mephisto's Realm but upon arriving minions kidnap [[Jean Grey]] and Nightcrawler. Blackheart, one of Mephisto's minions, puts them in separate cages above the Infinity Vortex. The player is faced with the choice of whether to save Nightcrawler or Jean Grey. One of them must be saved and another sacrificed, before the team can defeat Mephisto.

Using the Super Soldier Serum, stolen from the Omega Base, a massive army of Super Soldiers attacks Asgard and imprisons the Asgardian Gods. You travel to Valhalla to liberate it from its invading force and defeat the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]] so Bifrost Bridge can be opened. Later, The Twilight Sword is found to be shattered, having been used to take Odin's powers. So the player is sent to free the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer Armor]], to use on Dr.Doom. It is revealed that you were tricked in to freeing the armor for Loki. The heroes defeat Loki and the armor, but Dr. Doom appears, and reveals that he has stolen Odin's power. He uses it to try and kill the heroes, but before they can be killed [[Uatu]] the Watcher, saves them and transports them to the base of the [[Inhumans]] on the Moon. Uatu reveals the only way to beat Doom is to find the [[M'Kraan Crystal]] and steal the Muonic Inducer from [[Galactus]] (who is attacking the [[Skrull]] homeworld).

The player is sent to the Shi'ar Empire where they help restore [[Lilandra Neramani]] to the throne so that they can get a portion of the M'Kraan Crystal and thwart [[Deathbird]]. After retrieving the crystal, the player then travels to the Skrull homeworld to destroy Galactus' shield generators, and with the help of the [[Silver Surfer]] disable him to obtain the Muonic Inducer. While the player is doing this, it is shown that Dr. Doom has conquered Earth and corrupted many heroes after defeating them. Upon arriving back at Stark Tower, the team finds that Doom has converted it into "Doomstark" tower. The player must fend off an army of Iron Man-based robots so that they can reactivate the tower for usage.

The final level is set in Latveria, home of Doctor Doom, and whilst there they defeat the corrupted evil heroes, evil clones of the [[Fantastic Four]], and confront Dr. Doom. The heroes use the two devices obtained earlier to weaken Doom and upon being struck down by the heroes Doom is blasted by a bolt of lightning sent by a rejuvenated Odin, leaving nothing but his mask behind. 

Nick Fury tells the heroes that the team must disband and asks the heroes if they can count on them when another threat happens. Meanwhile, Galactus vows revenge on the heroes who stole from him and plans to destroy Earth.

===Subplot===
During the game a subplot takes place where [[Weasel (comics)|Weasel]] attempts to find proof that the [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]] is a double agent, and the player needs to obtain various pieces of information to aid his efforts. Ultimately the players call Nick Fury with information of Black Widow's apparent betrayal, it is revealed that Black Widow is innocent and her suspicious activities were part of an operation to try and retrieve plans that Dr. Doom had stolen from S.H.I.E.L.D. 

==Features==
Players can select teams of four from a range of more than twenty playable characters, allowing them to create their own superhero teams or recreate famous teams from within the comics, as well as have online and co-operative play, for up to 4 players. Players are able to fight in mid air, underwater and on the ground, with destructible and interactive environments. It spans several places on Earth, different dimensions, and the depths of space. The game has alternative endings, affected by the decisions the player(s) make throughout the game. These endings are based on whether or not the player chooses to complete optional missions.

In arcade mode players will have to fight for the most kills in order to get the experience points at the end of the level. Characters may have up to four costumes, which can alter the stats of the character. The game also features trivia games, artwork and many more references to the Marvel Universe.

Throughout the game, the team of heroes will have the opportunity to locate "Simulator Discs". These discs are playable from any S.H.I.E.L.D. training simulator. These are special comic book missions, where you play as a character and revisit a moment in it's past and face one of it's classic arch rivals. Each disc uses one hero and when you play the simulator for that hero, it is the only hero you may use. The missions on the discs each are different, but all have the same guidelines. You must defeat a certain boss and complete the Simulator within 20:00. In some character's discs, you must also defend a certain character. Once you complete the mission and defeat the boss, you are scored based on how many enemies you killed and on how quickly you completed it. There are also what is called "Vs" discs, in which you may play as your whole team.

==Versions==
[[Image:Ultimate alliance gold.jpg|thumb|125px|right|The Gold Edition Cover.]]

The game is available through several gaming systems, with a graphical engine that looks different on it's various platforms.

===Game Boy Advance===
"Marvel: Ultimate Alliance" has been altered for the Game Boy Advance port and has become a side-scrolling fighting game with minor RPG elements, such as the ability to alter your characters stats. The graphics are simplified for this system and the selection of characters has also been reduced. Some additional gameplay modes were added into this version of the game including a S.H.I.E.L.D. Simulator, Time Challenges, Scavenger Hunts, and a Survival mode. Teams for this port consist of three characters and a striker, a non-playable fourth character who can be summoned to perform a powerful attack directed toward on-screen enemies. 

Playable characters include Spiderman, Wolverine, Iceman, Blade, Captain America, Deadpool, Elektra, Ms. Marvel, Thor, The Thing, and Ghost Rider. The Special Strikers included in the game are Dr. Strange, Ghost Rider, Iron Man, Dark Pheonix, Namor the Submariner, and Vision. Spider-Man, Wolverine, and Captain America are the game's starter team but as the game progresses, characters become unlocked as more missions are completed.

===PC===
The PC version, like most PC games, is customizable, and many characters and their skins can be obtained from modding sites for play within the game. Also, the PC version's graphics vary depending on the customization of a user's settings, at maximum settings and shaders with premium hardware, the PC graphics will be similar to or better than the 7th generation versions. The PC version also features "intuitive mouse controls" <ref>[http://www.marvelultimatealliance.com/game_info.php Marvel: Ultimate Alliance official site]</ref> and works with a gamepad. 

===Playstation Portable===
The [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] version features simplified graphics, different characters, and extra features including the four exclusive playable Marvel characters [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]], [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]], [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]  and [[Ronin (comics)|Ronin]]. Other things unique to this version are 6 exclusive comic book missions including one which contained [[Andreas Strucker|Swordsman]], an exclusive prequel mission, and three exclusive single-player gameplay modes. For the PSP's online play, microphone support ''(voice chat)'' is available as well as online-recordable player statistics.

===Wii===
[[Image:Marvel 7th.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Spider-Man]], [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] attacking an enemy.]]
The [[Wii]] version has a few features unique to its version including specific motion-sensitive controls for normal moves, Motion-sensitive controlled Special attacks, unique for each character, and access to any special move at any time. For this version there is no online play, but there is a normal multiplayer mode in which up to four players may play at once. It also contains [[Moon Knight]] and [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], which were included in all the Next Generation versions.

===Xbox 360 and PS3===
The Xbox 360 version and the Playstation 3 version looks exactly the same as the Xbox 360 version with absolutely no differences. They also contain [[Moon Knight]] and [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], which were included in all the Next Generation versions.

Activision released 8 additional downloadable characters on the Xbox 360 via the Xbox Live Marketplace on April 26, 2007- [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], [[Venom (comics)|Venom]], [[Doctor Doom]], [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Activision to Release New Marvel: Ultimate Alliance Heroes and Villains on Xbox Live Marketplace|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/xbox360/rpg/marvelultimatealliance/news.html?sid=6167963&om_act=convert&om_clk=gsupdates&tag=updates;title;1|accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref>

''Marvel: Ultimate Alliance: Gold Edition'' was released for the Xbox 360 on May 22, 2007<ref>{{cite web |url=http://uk.xbox360.ign.com/objects/908/908243.html |title=Marvel: Ultimate Alliance Gold Edition |accessdate=2007-07-26 |format= |work=IGN }}</ref>. It has all eight downloadable heroes and villians that were originally available only on Xbox 360 through download on Xbox Live.

==Characters==
While ''Ultimate Alliance'' follows in the footsteps of Raven Software's ''[[X-Men Legends]]'' games, it has a broader scope of inclusion, adding playable heroes from [[Marvel Comics]]' other popular comics, including [[Spider-Man]], many different members of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], and the entire [[Fantastic Four]]. In addition, each character has four different costumes, except for Moon Knight, who has three. Most of these extra costumes are different costumes characters have had in their comics appearances; for example, Spider-Man has his black symbiote costume and his red and gold [[Spider-Man's powers and equipment#Stark Armor (Iron Spider)|"Iron Spider"]] costume, as well as his classic red and blue costume. Some of the costumes are alternate versions of the same character or even entirely separate characters with similar powers or appearance: for example, many characters appear in their [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] versions, and both versions of the character [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] as well as the [[MC2]] character [[Spider-Girl]] are available via the costume change feature.  Some costume changes are also renditions of the character in other media.  For example, [[Blade (comics)|Blade's]] "Daywalker" costume is the take on the Blade character during his [[Blade: The Series|short lived live action series]].

Putting together teams of characters who have a shared history together, for example, may give team bonuses (ex. using [[Captain America]], [[Iron Man (comics)|Iron Man]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Ms. Marvel]] on the same team would yield you the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], giving the player a boost in attack damage for all team members). Most teams are not taken from the comics but involve choosing characters with something in common. For instance, Thor, Storm, Human Torch and Iceman form Natural Forces, and any all-female team creates Femme Fatale. Using particular characters to interact with other NPCs can also yield additional dialogue, and villains will also react accordingly when met with their nemeses (for example, [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] will talk directly to [[Elektra Natchios|Elektra]] or [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] upon seeing those characters in the first chapter). 

While many characters in the game by default are rendered with the appearance they have in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] line of comics, the world of the game is predominantly based upon that of the [[Earth 616|original Marvel Universe]], with many villains, character designs and references to events that exist only in that continuity (for example, [[Galactus]] is the original Marvel Universe's version, not Ultimate Marvel's hive-minded robotic version), and both designs of Shocker and Nick Fury are of their classic ones, rather than their Ultimate ones.

One major fact to note is that the version of Nick Fury used for Alliance is not the same as previously appeared in the X-Men Legends game, instead being the classic original Nick Fury. However, the [[Ultimate Nick Fury|General Nick Fury]] model that was previously used is still available as an alternate costume for Fury, with both Nick Fury versions having two costumes each.

The [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] was going to be the final playable character, but as the rights to use the character are held by [[Sierra Entertainment]], this was not possible. However, the player meets Bruce Banner in the Omega Base & sees a defeated Hulk in a cinematic prior to the final mission.

[[Image:MarvelUltimateAllianceScreen.jpg|thumb|225px|right|[[Thing (comics)|Thing]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]], [[Spider-Man]] and [[Captain America]].]]

Characters that appear as alternate costumes are listed under the original character.<br>
:''All playable characters have four different costumes, except [[Moon Knight]], who has three.''.<br>
:''In the case of [[Nick Fury]], Two of his four represent [[Ultimate Nick Fury|General Nick Fury]]''.
:''In the case of [[Silver Surfer]], all of his alternate costumes look the same.''
All characters in italics are costume changes for other characters that are of different personas altogether. Daredevil, Black Panther, Nick Fury, Silver Surfer, Dr Strange, Ghost Rider and Blade are not available at the beginning of the game; some of them have to be unlocked by completing/collecting specific items whereas the rest are unlocked as you meet the characters in the game.
