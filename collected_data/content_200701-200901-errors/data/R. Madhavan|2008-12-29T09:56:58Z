===''Aayitha Ezhuthu'' and the future===
2004, despite starting poorly, was a very prolific year for Madhavan, who starred in the films ''[[Aethiree]]'', ''[[Nothing But Life]]'', and the critically acclaimed ''[[Aayitha Ezhuthu]]''. After ''Aethiree'' failed, Madhavan banked upon ''Nothing But Life'', an English film, to divert him back into a career of stardom. But it also failed, leaving Madhavan offerless. However, [[Mani Ratnam]] selected Madhavan to play a lead role in his forthcoming bilingual. The film was made as ''[[Aayitha Ezhuthu]]'' in Tamil and ''[[Yuva]]'' in Hindi, with only [[Esha Deol]] reprising her role in both versions. Apart from Deol, others in the multi-starrer were also actors who had been going through a rough patch. [[Surya Sivakumar]], [[Siddharth Narayan]], [[Meera Jasmine]] and [[Trisha Krishnan]] made up the rest of the cast. His character, Inba Sekhar, was a hitman living in the slums of [[Chennai]], who eventually went on to help a [[politician]] gain power. However Inba Sekhar's wife, Sasi, desperately tried to claw him away from his profession only to be beaten, thrown out and then come back crawling again.

The first of the two games, ''Madhavan's MIG'', featured the actor making a reprise of his [[Rang De Basanti]] [[Aviator|pilot]]'s role. In the other game titled ''Madhavan'', the player had to help the actor get to the premiere of his latest movie evading the paparazzi.<ref name="gametwo">{{cite web|author=Sangeetha Devi|year=2006|title=Play `Madhavan' on your Reliance mobile

====Game show hosting====
Madhavan was announced as the host of [[Sony Entertainment]] Television's [[Deal Ya No Deal]], the Indian version of the American game show [[Deal Or No Deal]], in October 2005.

However Madhavan quit as the lead anchor of the game show, [[Deal Ya No Deal]] in January 2006. Madhavan claimed he was "unhappy with the way the shoot schedules were handled by the production house". According to the actor, when he took on the show, he had "made it clear that he would continue with his South film assignments, and as the show was being filmed in Mumbai, he had found it hard to keep travelling throughout India from Chennai to film the ten days a month he had signed up for". The ever-changing look of the show meant Madhavan had to constantly rehearse. Madhavan also added that he was restricted by the producers to spend one day rehearsing technically, which left him with fatigue.<ref name="left">{{cite web|author=Sudhesh Kamath|year=2006|title=Madhavan returns as 'Thambi'

There were also some times, like when he shot for the show immediately after the funeral of his grandfather, when there was a celebrity special. Mandira Bedi replaced Madhavan as the anchor in February for Series 2 of the game show. Since then she has also left the set-up for personal reasons. He has also been a guest judge, in the Indian television show, [[Fame Gurukul]].<ref name="gurukul">{{cite web|author=Rachna Kanwar|year=2006|title=
