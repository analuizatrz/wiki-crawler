In 2005 there were twenty-eight U.S. states represented and four foreign countries. Young ladies at Camp Merrie-Woode develop confidence by participating in recreational team building activities such as river trips down the mighty [[Tuckasegee River|Tuckaseegee River]]. 

The [http://www.ncnhp.org/Images/Jackson09-19-05.pdf North Carolina National Heritage Program] lists Old Bald/Cherry Cove as one of the "significant natural areas of Jackson County" because of the forest of [[Northern Red Oak]]s in the region, as well as one of the two historic [[grassy bald]]s [http://www.merriewoode.com/images/ssaver600w.jpg] in the county. The land is registered a [[U.S. National Heritage Area]] and is owned by a combination of the [[National Park Service]], [[U.S. Forest Service]], local, and private entities. 

Camp Merrie-Woode operates as a [[501(c)(3)]] non-profit educational institution.

Camp Merrie-Woode was added in 1995 to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] for Jackson County, North Carolina.
