The [[Iberian Peninsula]] has been inhabited by [[hominin]] species for at least half a million years.  The peninsula was first inhabited by early hominin species, then by [[Neanderthal]]s and later by modern [[human]]s.  Iberia has seen the rise and fall of various [[Prehistory|perhistoric]] hominin [[Archaeological culture|cultures]].

== Stone ages ==
Hominin inhabitation of the Iberian Peninsula dates from the [[Paleolithic]].  Early hominin remains have been discovered at a number of sites on the peninsula.  Significant evidence of an extended occupation of Iberia by Neandertal man has also been discovered.  Homo sapiens first entered Iberia towards the end of the Paleolithic.  For a time Neanderthals and modern humans coexisted until the former were finally driven to extinction.  Modern man continued to inhabit the peninsula through the [[Mesolithic]] and [[Neolithic]] periods.

===Paleolithic===

Iberia has a wealth of prehistoric sites.  Many of the best preserved prehistoric remains are in the [[Atapuerca]] region, rich with limestone caves that have preserved a million years of human evolution. Among these sites is the cave of [[Gran Dolina]], where six hominin skeletons, dated between 780,000 and 1 million years ago, were found in 1994. Experts have debated whether these skeletons belong to the species ''[[Homo erectus]]'', ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'', or a new species called ''[[Homo antecessor]]''. In the Gran Dolina, investigators have found evidence of [[tool]] use to [[butcher]] animals and other hominins, the first evidence of [[cannibalism]] in a hominin species. Evidence of [[fire]] has also been found at the site, suggesting they cooked their meat.

Also in Atapuerca, is the site at Sima de los Huesos, or "Pit of Bones". Excavators have found the remains of 30 [[hominin]]s dated to about 400,000 years ago. The remains have been tentatively classified as ''Homo heidelbergensis'' and may be ancestors of the Neanderthals. No evidence of habitation has been found at the site except for one stone hand-ax, and all of the remains at the site are of young adults or teenagers. The age similarity suggests the remains were not the result of accidents. The seemingly deliberate placement of remains and lack of habitation may mean that the bodies were deliberately interred in the pit as a place of burial, which would make the site the first evidence of hominin burial.

Around 200,000 BC, during the [[Lower Paleolithic]] period, Neanderthals first entered the Iberian Peninsula.  Around 70,000 BC, during the [[Middle Paleolithic]] period the [[last ice age]] began and the Neanderthal [[Mousterian]] culture was established.  Around 35,000 BC, during the [[Upper Paleolithic]], the Neanderthal [[Châtelperronian]] cultural period began.  Emanating from [[Southern France]] this culture extended into Northern Iberia.  This culture continued to exist until around 28,000 BC when Neanderthal man faced extinction, their final refuge being present-day Portugal.

Neanderthal remains have been found at a number of sites on the Iberian Peninsula.  A Neanderthal skull was found in Forbes's Quarry in [[Gibraltar]] in 1848 making Spain the first country where remains of Neanderthals were found. Neanderthals were not recognized as a separate species until the discovering of remains in [[Neandertal, Germany]] in 1856. Subsequent Neanderthal discoveries in Gibraltar have also been made including the skull of a four-year-old child and preserved excrement on top of baked [[mussel]] shells.

In [[Zafarraya]] a Neanderthal [[mandible]] and Mousterian tools, associated with the Neanderthal culture, were found in 1995. The mandible was dated to about 28,000 BC and the tools to about 25,000 BC. These dates make the Zafarraya remains the youngest evidence of Neanderthals and have expanded the timeline of Neanderthal existence. The more recent dating of the remains also provides the first evidence for prolonged co-existence between Neanderthals and [[modern man]]. L'Arbreda Cave in [[Catalonia]] contains [[Aurignacian]] [[cave paintings]], as well as earlier remains from Neanderthals. Some have also suggested that the newer remains in Spain suggest Neanderthals were driven out of [[Central Europe]] by modern man to the Iberian peninsula where they sought refuge. 

[[Image:Map-of-human-migrations.jpg|thumb|left|World map of human migrations]]
Around 40,000 BC the first large settlement of [[Europe]] by modern humans, [[nomadic]] [[hunter-gatherer]]es came from the [[steppes]] of [[Central Asia]], characterized by the M173 [[mutation]] in the [[Y chromosome]], defining them as an [[haplogroup]] R [[population]].  When the last ice age reached its maximum extent, these modern humans took refuge in [[Southern Europe]], namely in Iberia, and in the steppes of southern [[Ukraine]] and [[Russia]].

From around 32,000 to 21,000 BC the modern human [[Aurignacian]] culture dominated Europe. Around 30,000 BC a new wave of modern humans made their way from [[Southern France]] into the Iberian peninsula. Here, this [[Population genetics|genetically homogenous population]] (characterized by the M173 [[mutation]] in the [[Y chromosome]]), developed the [[M343]] mutation, giving rise to the [[Haplogroup R1b (YDNA)|R1b]] [[Haplogroup]], still dominant in modern [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish people|Spanish]] populations. Around 28,000 BC the [[Gravettian]] culture began to succeed the Aurignacian. 

Around 19,000 BC the Gravettian culture was in turn replaced by that of the [[Solutrean]]s, who produced some of the finest [[flint]] work of the [[Stone Age]] allowing them to produce lighter [[projectile weapons]], among other advantages.  The [[pre-historic art]] in the Valley of Foz Côa (near modern [[Vila Nova de Foz Côa]], in [[Portugal]]) is one example of Solutrean cultural period.   

Around 15,000 BC, despite the superior production abilities of the Solutrean culture, it was replaced by the [[Magdalenian]] culture.  The Magdalenians period marked the height of cave painting.  By far the most significant cave painting site in Spain is [[Altamira (cave)|Altamira]], dated from about 16,000 to 9,000 BC.  Altamira is part of the [[Cantabrias]] region where many more caves with paintings have been found.  In Altamira, excavators have found evidence of human occupation alongside the paintings.  These artifacts include evidence of Solutrean occupation in addition to the Magdalenians, to whom most of the painting is attributed.  The Magdalenians used [[charcoal]], [[ochre]], [[haematite]], and animal [[fat]] to produce the elaborate display in the cave, the most noteworthy part of which is the Polychrome Ceiling, with many images of [[bison]] and other animals.  In addition to the grand scale of the paintings, the Stone Age artists also used comparatively advanced artistic techniques.  Because of the cave paintings' scale and quality, some have called Altamira the "The Sistine Chapel of Quaternary art".

===Mesolithic===
Around 10,000 BC an interstadial [[Glaciation|deglaciation]] called the [[Allerød Oscillation]] occurred, weakening the rigorous conditions of the [[last ice age]]. This also ended the [[Upper Palaeolithic]] period, beginning the [[Mesolithic]]. The populations sheltered in Iberia, descendants of the [[Cro-Magnon]], given the deglaciation, migrated and recolonized all of [[Western Europe]], thus spreading the [[Haplogroup R1b (YDNA)|R1b]] [[Haplogroup]] populations (still dominat, in variant degrees, from Iberia to [[Scandinavia]]). 

Noteworthy cultures of this period were the [[Azilian]] culture in [[Southern France]] and Northern Iberia (to the mouth of the [[Douro]] river) and the [[Muge Culture]] in the [[Tagus]] valley.  The Azilian culture replaced the Magdalenians around 8,000 BC.  The Azilians were the final Paleolithic culture to occupy the Iberian peninsula and extended their time span into the Mesolithic age.  During the Mesolithic period, cave art continued to advance, especially in the [[Levant]] area of Spain.

===Neolithic===
[[Image:Néolithique 0008.jpg|thumb|left|Anthropomorphic Neolithic figurine]]
Spain has many ruins of [[megalithic]] monuments created during the [[Neolithic]] period and continued into the Chalcolithic or Copper Age.  The monuments share many similarities with other Megalithic structures throughout Europe, including those in [[Brittany]] and [[Malta]].  [[Dolmens]] are an especially common structure built by the Neolithic Spaniards.

In the [[5th millennium BC]], with the beginning of the Neolithic in the Iberian peninsula started an autochthonous development of [[Agriculture]]. Also the [[Megalith|Megalithic European culture]] spread to most of [[Europe]] and had one of its oldest and main centres in the territory of modern [[Portugal]][http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almendres_Cromlech].

Meanwhile, the [[nomadic]] [[Hunter-gatherer]]s of the R [[Haplogroup]] (characterized by the M173 [[mutation]] in the [[Y chromosome]]) that had taken refuge during the [[last ice age]] in the [[Steppes]] of southern [[Ukraine]] and [[Russia]] (and had developed the M17 mutation, originating the R1a Haplogroup), gave rise to the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Proto-Indo-European]] cultures (predecessors of the Indo-European population and [[Indo-European languages|their languages]]), such as the [[Kurgan]] culture.

In the [[3rd millennium BC]] the [[Chalcolithic]] culture of [[Chalcolithic culture of Vila Nova|Vila Nova]], a Megalithic European culture around the area of modern [[Lisbon]], appeared. In the same period the [[Beaker culture]] spread to most of [[Western Europe]] ([[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[France]] [excluding the central massif], [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]], the [[Low Countries]], and [[Germany]] from the [[Elbe]] valley west, with an extension along the upper [[Danube]] into the [[Vienna basin]] in [[Austria]], with [[Mediterranean]] outposts on [[Sardinia]] and [[Sicily]]).

== Metal ages ==
[[Image:Galice castro.jpg|thumb|300px|A Castro village in [[Castro de Baroña]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Spain]]]]
Several different cultural groups inhabited Iberia during the [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age]]s before the arrival of colonizers, and eventually, the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].

===Bronze Age===
During the [[1st millennium BC]] a first wave of Indo-European migrations, of the [[Urnfield]] culture (Proto-[[Celt]]s), went to Iberia.  This triggered the beginning of the Bronze culture (Indo-European) in the Northwest of the peninsula (modern [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and northern Portugal), that maintained commercial relations with [[Brittany]] and the [[British Isles]]. It was during this period that the [[Castro (village)|Castro Village culture]] emerged in this Iberian area.  During the next centuries the Bronze culture arrived in Iberia [[Estremadura]] (not Indo-European) and [[Beira, Portugal|Beira Alta]] (not Indo-European but influenced by it).

The [[Iberians]] arrived on the peninsula sometime in the third millennium B.C.  Most scholars believe the Iberians came from somewhere farther east in the Mediterranean, although some have suggested that they originated in [[North Africa]].  The Iberians settled along the eastern coast of Spain.  The Iberians lived in isolated communities structured as tribes.  They also had a knowledge of metal working, including [[bronze]], and agricultural techniques.  In later years, the Iberians evolved into a more complex civilization with urbanized communities and social stratification.  They traded metals with the Phoenicians, [[Greeks]], and [[Carthaginians]].

The [[Beaker People]] spread throughout Europe c. 2000 BC and carried with them knowledge of [[metal work]] and their unique [[pottery]] designs.  The group may have originated in [[Spain]] or [[Portugal]].

The [[Vascones|Vascon]] people inhabited northern Spain from an unknown date.  The Vascons were mentioned by the Romans upon their arrival to Iberia.  The Vascons were likely the ancestors of the modern [[Basque people]] whose [[Basque language|language]], probably the descendent of the Vascon language, has been a linguistic enigma.  The language is outside the regionally dominant family of [[Indo-European languages]] and has no known similarities with other language families.

The [[Los Millares]] culture developed in the third millennium B.C.  Centered on the Los Millares site, the culture spread throughout [[Andalucia]] and eastern Spain.  The Los Millares site contained a complex defensive system with multiple rings of walls and a necropolis with a false dome.

[[Image:Dama de Baza ampliada.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Lady of Baza]], made by Iberians]]
The Los Millares culture fell to the [[El Argar]] culture, which lasted from c. 1800 B.C. to c. 1400 B.C.  The El Argar mined extensively for their metal working, including [[bronze]] work.  The culture disappeared abruptly in 1400 B.C. 

Another lost Iberian civilization were the [[Tartessos|Tartessians]], now known only through historical references and scattered artifacts.  The Tartessian society started to emerge in the territory of modern [[Andalusia]] approaching the Iron Age.  Tartessos, the first Iberian [[State]] mentioned in writing sources was developed in the tenth century BC. Tartessos was a centralized [[Monarchy]] brought about under [[Phoenicia]]n influence and maintained commercial relations with the area of modern [[Algarve]], inhabited by the [[Conii|Cynetes or Cunetes]], and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Estremadura]]. The Tartessos people had advanced knowledge of both metal working and navigation.  They sailed to the [[British isles]] to trade for [[tin]] and other metals.  They then traded these with [[Phoenicians]] who, possibly as early as 1100 B.C., established the city of [[Cadiz]] as a trading post.  There was strong Tartessian influence in the area of modern [[Algarve]] during the seventh century BC followed by the fall of Tartessos in the sixth century BC.  Nothing of Tartessos remains except scattered artifacts and historical references by classical civilizations.  The city is thought to have been at the mouth of the [[Guadalquivir]] river and now likely lies beneath its marshy delta.

===Iron Age===
The [[Celts]] of Europe entered Iberia through two separate migrations in the [[9th Century BC|ninth]] and [[7th Century BC|seventh centuries B.C.]]  They generally settled in the north and assimilated various other groups into Celtic culture.  The Celts mixed with the Iberians to form the [[Celtiberians]] who integrated the Celtic tradition and knowledge of iron working with Iberian culture.<!-- 7th Century BC: Second wave of [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] ([[Celts]] of the [[Hallstatt culture]]?) migration into [[Portugal|Portuguese]] territory.-->

[[Image:Anthropoid sarcophagus discovered at Cadiz - Project Gutenberg eText 15052.png|thumb|200px|right|Phoenician sarcophagus found in Cadiz]]
The [[Phoenicia]]ns of [[Asia]], [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] of [[Europe]], and [[Carthaginian]]s of Africa all colonized parts of Iberia to facilitate trade. During the tenth century BC the first contacts between Phoenicians and Iberia (along the [[Mediterranean]] coast) were made.  This century also saw the emergence of [[City|towns and cities]] in the southern littoral areas of eastern Iberia.
  
The Phoenicians founded colony of ''Gadir'' (modern [[Cádiz]]) near Tartessos.  The foundation of Cádiz, the oldest continuously-inhabited city in western Europe, is traditionally dated to 1104 BC, although, as of [[2004]], no [[archaeology|archaeological]] discoveries date back further than the ninth century BC.  The Phoenicians continued to use Cádiz as a trading post for several centuries leaving a variety of artifacts, most notably a pair of sarcophaguses from around the fourth or third centuries B.C.  Contrary to myth, there is no record of Phoenician colonies west of the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], even though there might have been some voyages of discovery. Phoenician influence in what is now [[Portugal|Portuguese]] territory was through cultural and commercial exchange with Tartessos.

During the ninth century BC the Phoenicians (from the city-state of [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]] founded the colony of [[Carthage]] (in [[North Africa]]).  During this century Phoenicians also had great influence on Iberia with the introduction the [[Iron#History|use of Iron]], of the [[Potter's wheel]], the production of [[Olive oil]] and [[Wine]]. They were also responsible for the first forms of Iberian writing, had great religious influence and accelerated urban development. However, there is little evidence to support the myth of a Phoenician foundation of the city as far back as [[1300 BC]], under the name ''Alis Ubbo'' ("Safe Harbour").  Also during the ninth century BC there are organized settlements in ''Olissipona'' (modern [[Lisbon]], in [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Estremadura]]) with clear [[Mediterranean]] influences. 

There was strong Phoenician influence in the city of ''Balsa'' (modern [[Tavira]] in the [[Algarve]]) in the [[8th Century BC|eighth century BC]].  Phoenician influenced Tavira was destroyed by violence in the [[6th Century BC|sixth century BC]]. With the decadence of Phoenician colonization of the [[Mediterranean]] coast of Iberia in the sixth century BC many of the colonies are deserted.  The sixth century BC also saw the rise of the colonial might of [[Carthage]], which slowly replaced the Phoenicians in their former areas of dominion.

The Greek colony at what now is [[Marseilles]] began trading with the Celtiberians on the eastern coast around the eighth century B.C.  The Greeks finally founded their own colony at [[Empúries|Ampurias]], in the eastern [[Mediterranean]] shore (modern [[Catalonia]]), during the sixth century BC beginning their settlement in the Iberian peninsula.  There are no Greek colonies west of the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], only voyages of discovery. There is no evidence to support the myth of an ancient Greek founding of ''Olissipo'' (modern [[Lisbon]]) by [[Odysseus]].

Also during the sixth century BC there was a cultural shift in southern [[Portugal|Portuguese]] territory after the fall of Tartessos, with a strong Mediterranean character that prolonged and modified Tartessian culture. This occurred mainly in Low [[Alentejo]] and the [[Algarve]], but had littoral extensions up to the [[Tagus]] mouth (namely the important city of ''Bevipo'', modern [[Alcácer do Sal]]).  The first form of writing in western Iberia (south of [[Portugal]]), the [[Southwest script]] (still to be translated), dated to the sixth century BC, denotes strong Tartessian influence in its use of a modified [[Phoenician alphabet]]. In this writings the word [[Conii]] (similar to Cunetes or Cynetes, the people of the [[Algarve]]) appears frequently.

The poem ''[[Ora Maritima]]'', written by [[Avienus]] in the [[4th century]] and based on the [[Massaliote Periplus]] of the [[6th Century BC]], states that all of western Iberia was once called for the name of its people, the [[Oestriminis]], which were replaced by an invasion of the ''Saephe'' or ''Ophis'' (meaning Serpent). From then on western Iberia would have been know as [[Ophiussa]] (Land of the Serpents). The poem probably translates  the impact of the Second wave of [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] migrations ([[Celt]]ic) in the [[7th Century BC]]. The poem also describes the various ethnic groups the present at that time:
*The [[Saephe or Ophis]], today seen as probably [[Hallstatt culture]] [[Celts]], in all of western Iberia (modern [[Portugal]]) between the [[Douro]] and the [[Sado River|Sado]] rivers.
*The [[Cempsi]], probably [[Hallstatt culture]] [[Celts]], in the [[Tagus]] mouth and the south up to the [[Algarve]].
*The [[Conii|Cynetes or Cunetes]] in the extreme south and some cities along the [[Atlantic]] coast (such as ''Olissipo'', modern [[Lisbon]]), probably not [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]], but autochthonous Iberian (even if strongly or totally celticized over the next centuries).
*The [[Dragani]], [[Celt]] or Proto-Celt of the first [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] wave, in the mountainous areas of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], northern [[Portugal]], [[Asturias]] and [[Cantabria]].
*The [[Lusis]], probably a first reference to the [[Lusitanians]], similar to the Dragani ([[Celt]] or Proto-Celt of the first [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] wave).

The [[5th Century BC|fifth century BC]] saw the urban bloom of Tartessian influenced Tavira, further development of strong [[Central European]] ([[Celt]]ic) influences and migrations in western Iberia north of the [[Tagus]] river and the development of a second [[Castro (village)|Castro Village culture]] in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and northern [[Portugal]]. [[Mint (coin)|Minting]] of [[coins]] and use of [[money]] in the Iberian peninsula dates bacl to the fifth century BC.  During this century discovery voyages to the [[Atlantic]] are made by the [[Carthaginians]].  The [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] historian [[Herodotus of Halicarnassus]] cites the word ''Iberia'' to designate what is now the [[Iberian peninsula]], according to ancient Greek costume.

In the [[4th Century BC|fourth century BC]] the [[Celtici]], a new wave of Celtic migration (of the [[La Tène culture]]), enter Iberia going as far as modern-day Portuguese territory and settle in the [[Alentejo]] also penetrating in the [[Algarve]].  The [[Turduli]] and [[Turdetani]], probably descendants of the Tartessians, became established in the area of the [[Guadiana]] river, in the south of modern Portugal.  A series of cities in the Algarve, such as ''Balsa'' (Tavira), ''Baesuris'' ([[Castro Marim]]), ''Ossonoba''([[Faro, Portugal|Faro]]) and ''Cilpes'' ([[Silves]]), became inhabited by the [[Conii|Cynetes or Cunetes]] progressively mingled with Celtic populations.  The [[Lusitanians]] (most probably proto-Celt) beagan to inhabit the area between the [[Douro]] and the [[Tagus]] rivers (and progressively penetrate the High Alentejo). They are neighbored to the east by the [[Vettones]] (also probably proto-Celt).  The Celtic [[Gallaecia|Calaicians or Gallaeci]] inhabit all the region above the Douro river (modern [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and northern Portugal).

During the fourth century BC [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] began to rise as a [[Mediterranean]] power rival to Africa-based [[Carthage]].  After their defeat to Rome in the [[First Punic War]] ([[264 BC]]-[[241 BC]]), the Carthaginians began to extend their conquest of Iberia to expand their empire further into Europe.  In the [[Second Punic War]] ([[218 BC]]-[[202 BC]]), [[Hannibal]] marched his armies, which included Iberians, from Africa through Iberia to cross the Alps and attack the Romans in Italy.  Carthage was again defeated and lost Iberia.  Rome began its conquest and occupation of the peninsula, thus beginning the era of [[Hispania]].
