==Etymology==
{{main|Etymology of Brazil}}

Named after the [[brazilwood]] tree, so-named because its reddish wood resembled the color of red-hot embers (''brasil'' in [[Portugal|Portuguese]]). The [[Tupi people]] call it "ibirapitanga", which means literally 'red wood'. The wood of the tree was used to color clothes and fabrics.

Another theory stands that the name of the country is related to the Irish myth of [[Hy-Brazil]], a [[phantom island]] similar to [[St. Brendan's Island]], situated southwest of Ireland. The legend was so strong that during the 15th century many expeditions tried to find it, the most important being [[John Cabot]]. As the Brazilian lands were reached by [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] in 1500 C.E., the Irish myth would have influenced the late name given to the country (after "Island of Real Cross" and "Land of Holy Cross"). The proof that the legend was popular among Iberic people may be verified by the name of the Azorean [[Terceira Island]], registered in the 14th century in the Atlas Catalan and around 1436 on the Venetian map of [[Andrea Bianco]].

==History==
{{main|History of Brazil}}

Fossil records found in [[Minas Gerais]] show evidence that the area now called Brazil has been inhabited for at least 8,000 years by indigenous populations.<ref>[http://www.niee.ufrgs.br/alunos/projeto/equipes/labi/labi.html Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul)]</ref> It is generally accepted that Brazil was first discovered by Europeans on [[April 22]], [[1500]], when [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] reached the territory, claimed it for [[Portugal]], and named it Vera Cruz (True Cross),<ref>[http://concise.britannica.com/dday/print%253FarticleId%253D105994&fullArticle%253Dtrue&tocId%253D23813 Britannica]</ref> though this is [[Controversies about the discovery of Brazil|contested by some]].

===Colony===
{{main|Colonial Brazil|Indigenous peoples of Brazil}}

[[Image:Brazil-16-map.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Map of Brazil issued by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[explorer]]s in 1519.]]

Until 1530, Portugal had little interest in Brazil, mainly due to the high profits gained through commerce with [[Indochina]]. This lack of interest led to several "invasions" by different countries, such as [[France]] in Rio de Janeiro, and the [[Netherlands]] in Recife, so the Portuguese Crown devised a system to effectively occupy Brazil, without paying the costs. Through the [[Hereditary Captaincies]] system, Brazil was divided into strips of land that were donated to Portuguese noblemen, who were in turn responsible for the occupation of the land and answered to the king. Later, the Portuguese realized the system was a failure (only two lots were successfully occupied) and took direct control of the failed captaincies.<ref>Fundação Maria e Oscar Americano website, [http://www.fundacaooscaramericano.org.br/eng/Collection/Colonial_Brazil/colonial_brazil.html "Colonial Brazil"], retrieved [[12 June]] [[2007]].</ref><ref>CasaHistória website, [http://www.casahistoria.net/Brazil.htm#Colonial_Brazil "Colonial Brazil"], retrieved [[12 June]] [[2007]].</ref>

After the initial attempts to find gold and silver failed, the Portuguese colonists adopted an economy based on the production of agricultural goods that were to be exported to Europe. [[Tobacco]], [[cotton]], [[cachaça]] and some other agricultural goods were produced, but [[sugar]] became by far the most important Brazilian colonial product until the early eighteenth century.<ref>[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0013-0117(1963)2%3A16%3A2%3C219%3AAT1%3E2.0.CO%3B2-Q JSTOR: Anglo-Portuguese Trade, 1700-1770]</ref><ref>[http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/history/lecture34/lec34.html Lecture 34]</ref><ref>[http://www.history.pdx.edu/hdwp/colonial/breannanickila/agrig.htm The Development of Agriculture in Colonial Latin America] History.pdx.edu</ref> The first sugarcane farms were established in the mid-16th century and were the key for success of the captaincies of São Vicente and Pernambuco, leading sugarcane [[plantation]]s to quickly spread to other coastal areas in colonial Brazil. The period of sugar-based economy (1530-c.1700) is known as the "Sugarcane Cycle" in Brazilian history. Even though Brazilian sugar was reputed as being of high quality, the industry faced a crisis during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries when the Dutch and the French started producing sugar in the [[Antilles]], located much closer to Europe, causing the sugar prices to fall.

During the eighteenth century, private explorers who called themselves the [[Bandeirantes]] found gold and diamond mines in the state of Minas Gerais. The exploration of these mines ended up financing the Portuguese Royal Court's debts for a long time. However, the predatory way in which such riches were explored by the Portuguese Crown harmed colonial Brazil with excessive taxes (at some point, taxes amounted up to one fifth of all the gold and diamonds mined in the country, or 20 percent of total production, named the ''quinto''). Some popular movements supporting independence came about against the abusive taxes established by the metropolis, such as the [[Tiradentes]] incident in 1789, but they were often dismissed with violence by Portugal.<ref>Maxwell, Kenneth R. ''Conflicts and Conspiracies: Brazil and Portugal 1750-1808''. Cambridge University Press: 1973.</ref> Gold production declined towards the end of the eighteenth century, starting a period of relative stagnation of the Brazilian hinterland.<ref>[http://www.v-brazil.com/information/geography/minas-gerais/history.html Minas Gerais, Brazil: History]</ref>

===Empire===
{{main|Brazilian Declaration of Independence|Empire of Brazil}}

[[Image:Fala do trono.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Emperor Dom [[Pedro II of Brazil]], 1873.]]

In [[1808]], the Portuguese court, fleeing from [[Napoleon]]’s troops which had invaded the territory of Portugal, moved aboard a large fleet, escorted by [[United Kingdom|British]] men-of-war, with all the government apparatus to its then-colony, Brazil, establishing themselves in the city of Rio de Janeiro. From there the Portuguese king [[John VI of Portugal|João VI]] ruled his huge empire for 13 years, and there he would have remained for the rest of his life if it were not for the turmoil aroused in Portugal due, among other reasons, to his long stay in Brazil after the end of Napoleon's reign.<ref>CasaHistória website, [http://www.casahistoria.net/Brazil.htm#Independence "Independence and Empire"], retrieved [[12 June]] [[2007]]</ref>

After João VI returned to Portugal in 1821 due to the [[Liberal Revolution of 1820]] that had erupted in the city of [[Porto]], his heir-apparent [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro]] became regent of the Kingdom of Brazil. Following a series of [[Brazilian Declaration of Independence|political events and disputes]], Brazil achieved its independence from Portugal on [[September 7]] [[1822]]. On [[October 12]] [[1822]], Dom Pedro was acclaimed as the first Emperor of Brazil. He was crowned on [[December 1]] [[1822]]. Brazil was one of only two countries among those of the 'new world' that housed an effective legal monarchical state (the other was [[Empire of Mexico|Mexico]]), for a period of almost 90 years.

Organizing the new government quickly brought the differences between the Emperor and his leading subjects to the fore. In 1824, Pedro closed the Constituent Assembly that he had convened because he believed that body was endangering liberty. Pedro then produced a constitution modeled on that of Portugal (1822) and France (1814). It specified indirect elections and created the usual three branches of government but also added a fourth, the "moderating power", to be held by the Emperor. Pedro's government was considered economically and administratively inefficient. Political pressures eventually made the Emperor step down in [[April 7]], [[1831]]. He returned to Portugal leaving behind his five-year-old son Pedro. Brazil was then to be governed by regents from 1831 to 1840 until Pedro was old enough to assume his royal duties. The regency period was turbulent and marked by numerous local revolts including the [[Male Revolt]], the largest urban slave rebellion in the Americas, which took place in Bahia, 1835.<ref>Reis, João José. ''Slave Rebellion in Brazil - The Muslim Uprising of 1835 in Bahia''. Translated by Arthur Brakel. Johns Hopkins University Press.</ref>

On [[July 23]] [[1840]], [[Pedro II]] was crowned Emperor. His government was highlighted by a substantial rise in coffee exports, the [[War of the Triple Alliance]], and the end of [[slave trade]] from Africa in 1850, although [[slavery]] in Brazilian territory would only be abolished in 1888. When slavery was finally abolished, a large influx of European immigrants took place <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/latam/SLAVERY-ABOLITION.html |title=Slavery and Abolition |date= |quote=A Journal of Comparative Studies |accessdate=2007-07-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://http.gogobrazil.com/angloirishpress.html |title=Links between Brazil & Ireland |date=2004 |quote= Aspects of an Economic and Political Controversy between Great Britain and Brazil, 1865-1870. |accessdate=2007-07-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0022-216X(196911)1%3A2%3C115%3ATIOBAT%3E2.0.CO%3B2-S |title=JSTOR |date= |quote=The Independence of Brazil and the Abolition of the Brazilian Slave Trade: Anglo-Brazilian Relations, 1822-1826 |accessdate=2007-07-19}}</ref>. By the 1870s, the Emperor's grasp on domestic politics had started deteriorating in face of crisis with the Roman Catholic Church, the Army and the slaveholders. The Republican movement slowly gained strength. In the end, the empire fell because the dominant classes no longer needed it to protect their interests.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ciaonet.org/atlas/countries/br_data_loc.html#a4 |title=CIAO Atlas |date= |quote=The Empire, 1822-89 |accessdate=2007-06-23}}</ref> Indeed, imperial centralization ran counter to their desire for local autonomy. By 1889 Pedro II had stepped down and the Republican system had been adopted.

The country’s name became the ''Republic of the United States of Brazil'' (which in 1967 was changed to ''Federative Republic of Brazil''). From 1889 to 1930, the government was a constitutional democracy, with the presidency alternating between the dominant states of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] and [[Minas Gerais]].<ref>CasaHistória website, [http://www.casahistoria.net/Brazil.htm#Republic_1889-1964 "Republic"], retrieved [[12 June]] [[2007]]</ref><ref>U.S. Library of Congress, Federal Research Division, Country Studies: Brazil, [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+br0022) "The Era of Getúlio Vargas, 1930-54"]</ref> However, several requirements had to be fulfilled for people to be eligible to vote. Thus, democracy was actually restricted to a small portion of the population.

A [[military junta]] took control in 1930. Getúlio Vargas took office soon after, and would remain as dictatorial ruler (with a brief democratic period in between), until 1945. He was re-elected in 1951 and stayed in office until his suicide in 1954. After 1930, the successive governments continued industrial and agriculture growth and development of the vast interior of Brazil.<ref>Library of Congress website, Country Studies, [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+br0022) "The Era of Getúlio Vargas, 1930-54"], retrieved [[12 June]] [[2007]]</ref>

Provisional president Getúlio Dorneles Vargas ruled as dictator (1930–1934), congressionally elected president (1934–1937), and again dictator (1937–1945), with the backing of his revolutionary party coalition. He also served as a senator (1946–1951) and the democratically elected president (1951–1954).<ref>CasaHistória website, [http://www.casahistoria.net/Brazil.htm#Republic_1889-1964 "Republic 1889-1964"], retrieved [[12 June]] [[2007]]</ref> Vargas was a member of the ''[[gaucho]]'' oligarchy whose riches were based on land property, and rose to power through a system of patronage and clientelism,<ref>Valença, Márcio M.

Retrieved [[16 June]] [[2007]]</ref> but he had a fresh vision of how Brazilian politics could be shaped to support national development. He understood that with the breakdown of direct relations between workers and employers in the ever-growing factories in Brazil, workers could eventually become the platform of a new form of political power — [[populism]]. By applying such insights inspired on Italian [[fascism]], he would gradually establish such mastery over the Brazilian political world that he would stay in power for fifteen years. Vargas was responsible for Brazil's military role in [[World War II]] on the side of the Allies.<ref>CasaHistória website, [http://www.casahistoria.net/Brazil.htm#Republic_1889-1964 "Republic 1889-1964"], retrieved [[June 12]], [[2007]]</ref>

[[Juscelino Kubitschek]]'s office years ([[1956]]-[[1961]]) were marked by the political campaign motto of plunging ''"50 anos em 5"'' ([[English language|English]]: fifty years (of development) in five). Kubitschek sought to achieve this progress with the aid of foreign investment, which in turn would be given generous incentives such as profit remittances abroad, low taxes, privileges for the import of industrial [[machinery]], and government grants of land. Kubitschek was responsible for the construction of [[Brasília]], Brazil's ultra-modern capital, in the 1960s.

The [[military]] forces took office in Brazil in a [[coup d'état]] in 1964, and remained in power until March 1985, when it fell from grace because of political struggles between the regime and the Brazilian elites. Some historians may argue that the dismantling of the military dictatorship was merely a consequence of the regime's opening policy in the final years, but others will find that internal struggles for power within the government, combined with a strong popular disapproval of the dictatorship, were also partially responsible for the end of the regime. Just as the Brazilian regime changes of 1889, 1930, and 1945 unleashed competing political forces and caused divisions within the military, so too did the 1964 regime change.<ref>CasaHistória website, [http://www.casahistoria.net/Brazil.htm#Military_Rule "Military Rule"], retrieved [[June 12]] [[2007]]</ref> [[Tancredo Neves]] was elected president in an indirect election in 1985, as Brazil returned to civil government regime.

{{main|Law of Brazil}}

[[Image:Ellen Gracie e Guido Mantega.jpg|thumb|left|210px|The finance minister, [[Guido Mantega]], and the president of the [[Supreme Federal Tribunal]], [[Ellen Gracie Northfleet]].]]

Brazilian Law is based on Roman-Germanic traditions.<ref>[http://www.oas.org/juridico/mla/en/bra/en_bra-int-des-ordrjur.html "The Brazilian Legal System"], Organization of American States. Accessed [[May 17]], [[2007]].</ref> Thus, [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] concepts prevail over common law practices. Most of Brazilian law is [[codified]], although non-codified statutes also represent a substantial part of the system, playing a complementary role. Court decisions set out interpretation guidelines; however, they are not binding towards other specific cases but in very few exceptional situations. Doctrinal works and comments of legal academic pundits have strong influence in law creation and in legal cases.

The Federal Constitution, promulgated on [[October 5]], [[1988]], is the fundamental law of Brazil and it rules the system. All other legislation and court decisions must conform to its rules.<ref> Silva, José Afonso da; ''Curso de Direito Constitucional Positivo''; Malheiros, 2004, p. 46, ISBN 85-7420-559-1</ref> As of April 2007, it has been through 53 Amendments. States also adopt their own Constitutions, but they must also not contradict the Federal Constitution.<ref> Silva, José Afonso da; ''Curso de Direito Constitucional Positivo''; Malheiros, 2004, p. 592, ISBN 85-7420-559-1</ref> Municipalities and the Federal District do not have their own Constitutions; instead, they adopt "organic laws" ({{lang|pt|''leis orgânicas''}}).<ref>Brazilian Federal Constitution, articles 29 and 32 [http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constituiçao.htm "Constituição Federal"], Brazilian Government (official text).

Legislative entities are the main source of statutes, although in certain matters judiciary<ref>Brazilian Federal Constitution, article 96, I, ''a'' [http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constituiçao.htm "Constituição Federal"], Brazilian Government (official text).

Accessed [[May 17]], [[2007]]</ref> may also enact legal norms. The Federation enacts federal laws by means of the two houses of the National Congress, the Senate and the House of Representatives. The States, Municipalities and Federal District enact, respectively, state, municipal and district laws through local legislative houses. There is no hierarchy among federal, state, municipal and district laws. To avoid possible contradictions, the Federal Constitution determines which law fields each entity may legislate upon.<ref>Brazilian Federal Constitution, articles 22, 24, 25, and 30, I, II [http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constituiçao.htm "Constituição Federal"], Brazilian Government (official text). Accessed [[May 17]], [[2007]]</ref> Therefore, a certain law may be deemed unconstitutional if it invades a subject or territory reserved for laws of another legislative house.

[[Jurisdiction]] is administered by the judiciary entities, although in rare cases, the Federal Constitution allows the Federal Senate to pass on legal judgments.<ref>Brazilian Federal Constitution, article 52 [http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constituiçao.htm "Constituição Federal"], Brazilian Government (official text). Accessed [[May 17]], [[2007]]</ref> The Judiciary is organized in the Federal and State levels, though not in Municipalities.

Accessed [[May 17]], [[2007]].</ref> The highest court is the [[Supreme Federal Tribunal]].

The main criticism this system met over the last decades relates to the slow pace at which final decisions are passed. Lawsuits on appeal may take several years to resolve, and in some cases more than a decade to see definitive judgment.<ref> Glugoski, Miguel; Medauar, Odete.

===States===
{{main|States of Brazil}}

Brazil is a [[federation]] consisting of twenty-six states ({{lang|pt|''estados''}}) and one federal district ({{lang|pt|''Distrito Federal''}}), making a total of twenty-seven "federate units"<!--"federal units"...?-->.

The Brazilian states enjoy a significant autonomy of government, law making, public security and taxation <ref>{{PDFlink|[http://info.worldbank.org/etools/docs/library/233842/Afonso.pdf Decentralization and Budget Management of local Government in Brazil]}}</ref>. The government of a state is headed by a [[Governor]] ({{lang|pt|''governador''}}), elected by popular vote, and also comprises its own legislative body ({{lang|pt|''assembléia legislativa''}}).
Each state is divided into [[municipality|municipalities]] ({{lang|pt|''municípios''}}) with their own [[legislative]] council ({{lang|pt|''câmara de vereadores''}}) and a mayor ({{lang|pt|''prefeito''}}), which are autonomous and hierarchically independent from both federal and state government. A municipality may include other towns ({{lang|pt|''distritos''}}) besides the municipal seat; those, however, have no separate government.

The [[judiciary]] is organized at the state and federal levels within districts called {{lang|pt|''foros''}}. The {{lang|pt|''foros''}} in the state judiciary are called {{lang|pt|''comarcas''}}. Each {{lang|pt|''comarca''}} may include one or several municipalities. In the federal judiciary the {{lang|pt|''foros''}} are called {{lang|pt|''seções judiciárias''}}. One {{lang|pt|''seção judiciária''}} corresponds to the area of one State or the Federal District, according to article 110 of the Federal Constitution. {{lang|pt|''Seções judiciárias''}} may be divided in smaller units, called {{lang|pt|''subseções judiciárias''}}.

==Geography and climate==
{{main|Geography of Brazil|Climate of Brazil}}

[[Image:Iguacu-001.jpg|thumb|right|210px|The [[Iguazu Falls]].]]

Brazil is characterized by the extensive low-lying [[Amazon Rainforest]] in the north and a more open terrain of hills and low mountains to the south &mdash; home to most of the Brazilian population and its agricultural base. Along the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast are also found several mountain ranges, reaching roughly 2,900 [[meter]]s (9,500&nbsp;[[Foot (unit of length)|ft]]) high. The highest peak is the 3,014 meter (9,735&nbsp;ft) [[Pico da Neblina]] (''Misty Peak'') in [[Guiana]]'s [[highland (geography)|highlands]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.keadventure.com/countries/brazil/ |title=Ke Adventure |date= |quote=Adventure in Brazil |accessdate=2007-06-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amateur-hikers.com/highest.asp?cid=133 |title=Amateur-Hikers website |date= |quote=Highest Peaks In Brazil |accessdate=2007-06-20}}</ref> Major rivers include the [[Amazon River|Amazon]], the largest river in the world in flowing water volume, and the second-longest in the world; the [[Paraná River|Paraná]] and its major tributary, the [[Iguaçu]] River, where the [[Iguaçu Falls]] are located; the [[Rio Negro|Negro]], [[São Francisco River|São Francisco]], [[Xingu River|Xingu]], [[Madeira river|Madeira]] and the [[Tapajós]] rivers.

A number of [[island]]s in the Atlantic Ocean are part of Brazil: [[São Pedro e São Paulo|Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago]], [[Rocas Atoll]], [[Fernando de Noronha]] and [[Trindade and Martim Vaz]].

Located mainly within the [[tropics]], Brazil's [[climate]] has little seasonal variation. Southern Brazil, however, has a subtropical temperate weather, occasionally experiencing frost and snow in the higher regions. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] is abundant in the humid [[Amazon Basin]], but more arid landscapes are found as well, particularly in the northeast.

[[Image:Amazon.A2002182.1405.1km.jpg|thumb|left|210px|The [[Amazon Rainforest]].]]

Although 90% of the country is within the [[tropical zone]], the climate of Brazil varies considerably from the mostly tropical North (the [[equator]] traverses the mouth of the Amazon) to [[temperate zone]]s below the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] (23°27' S latitude), which crosses the country at the latitude of the city of [[São Paulo (city)|São Paulo]]. Brazil has five climatic regions: [[equatorial]], [[tropical]], [[semiarid]], [[tropical|highland tropical]], and [[subtropical]].

Temperatures along the equator are high, averaging above 25 °C, but not reaching the summer extremes of up to 40 °C in the temperate zones.<ref>El-DMC website, [http://www.el-dmc.com.br/brazil/climate.asp "Climate in Brazil"], retrieved 03 January 2006.</ref> There is little seasonal variation near the equator, although at times it can get cool enough for wearing a jacket, especially in the rain. At the country's other extreme, there are frosts south of the Tropic of Capricorn during the winter (June-August), and in some years there is snow in the mountainous areas, such as [[Rio Grande do Sul]] and [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]]. Temperatures in the cities of [[São Paulo]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.world66.com/southamerica/brazil/saopaulo/lib/climate |title=World66 |date= |quote=São Paulo climate chart |accessdate=2007-07-28}}</ref>, [[Belo Horizonte]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.world66.com/southamerica/brazil/belohorizonte/lib/climate |title=World66 |date= |quote=Belo Horizonte climate chart |accessdate=2007-07-28}}</ref>, and [[Brasília]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.v-brazil.com/tourism/brasilia/climate-brasilia.html |title=Brazil Travel |date= |quote=Weather in Brasilia |accessdate=2007-07-28}}</ref> are moderate (usually between 15 °C and 30 °C), despite their relatively low latitude, because of their elevation of approximately 1,000 meters.

Precipitation levels vary widely. Most of Brazil has moderate [[rainfall]] of between 1,000 and 1,500 millimeters a year, with most of the rain falling in the summer (between December and April) south of the Equator. The [[Amazon region]] is notoriously humid, with rainfall generally more than 2,000 millimeters per year and reaching as high as 3,000 millimeters in parts of the western Amazon and near Belém. It is less widely known that, despite high annual precipitation, the Amazon rain forest has a three- to five-month dry season, the timing of which varies according to location north or south of the equator.<ref>El-DMC website, [http://www.el-dmc.com.br/brazil/climate.asp "Climate in Brazil"], retrieved 03 January 2006.</ref>

==Environment==
{{main|Environment of Brazil}}

[[Image:Ramphastos toco.jpg|right|thumb|210px|The [[Toco Toucan]] is a typical animal of the Brazilian [[rain forest]]s.]]

Brazil's immense area is subdivided into different [[ecosystem]]s, which together sustain some of the world's greatest [[biodiversity]]. Due to the relatively explosive economic and demographic rise of the country in the last century, Brazil's ability to protect its [[Habitat (ecology)|environmental habitats]] has increasingly come under threat. Extensive [[logging]] in the nation's forests, particularly the Amazon, both official and unofficial, destroys areas the size of a small country each year, and potentially a diverse variety of plants and animals.<ref>[[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] Forest Service website, [http://www.fs.fed.us/global/globe/l_amer/brazil.htm Forest Service International Programs: Brazil], retrieved February 2007.</ref>

Brazil has a diverse and sophisticated services industry as well. During the early [[1990s]], the banking sector amounted to as much as 16% of GDP. Although undergoing a major overhaul, Brazilian financial services industry provides local businesses with a wide range of products and is attracting numerous new market players, including U.S. financial institutions and overseas firms issuing and trading Brazilian Depositary Receipts (BDRs).<ref>Official Bovespa's [http://www.bovespa.com.br/pdf/bdr_i_20122001.pdf "Guide to BDRs"]</ref> The [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] and [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] stock exchanges are undergoing a merger.<ref>[http://www.brasil.gov.br/ingles/about_brazil/brasil_topics/economy/categoria_view Economy and business] Brazilian Government</ref>

One of the issues the [[Central Bank of Brazil|Brazilian central bank]] ("Bacen") is currently dealing with is the excess of [[speculation|speculative]] short-term capital inflows to the country in the past few months, which might explain in part the recent downfall of the U.S. dollar against the real over the past months.<ref>[http://www.ipea.gov.br/sites/000/2/publicacoes/eqb/ieq11.pdf ''Economic Quarterly March 2007''], IPEA official report.</ref> Nonetheless, [[foreign direct investment]] (FDI), related to long-term, less speculative investment in production, is estimated to be USD 193.8bn for 2007.<ref>The Institute of International Finance, [http://www.iif.com/press/press+32.php "Capital Flows to Emerging Markets Set at Close to Record Levels"], retrieved [[06 June]] [[2007]]</ref> Inflation monitoring<ref>Central Bank of Brazil, [http://www.bcb.gov.br/htms/relinf/ing/2004/06/ri200406b2i.pdf "IPCA, IPC-FIPE and IPC-BR: Methodological and Empirical Differences" (2004)], retrieved [[18 June]] [[2007]].</ref> and control currently plays a major role in Brazil's Central Bank activity in setting out short-term interest rates as a monetary policy measure.

Brazil's population is very diverse, comprising many races and [[ethnic group]]s. In general, Brazilians trace their origins from four sources of [[migration]]:
* [[Amerindians]], Brazil's indigenous population, who are believed by some archeologists to be human groups that migrated from [[Siberia]] across the [[Bering Strait]] around 9000 BC.
* [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] colonists and settlers, arriving from 1500 onward.
* [[African]]s brought to the country from 1530 until the end of the slave trade in 1850.
* Diverse groups of [[immigrant]]s from [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and the [[Middle East]] arriving in Brazil during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

It is believed that the Americas were settled by three migratory waves from Northern Asia. The Native Brazilians are thought to descend from the first wave of migrants, who arrived in the region around 9000 BC. The main Native Brazilian groups are the [[Tupi]]-[[Guarani]], the [[Jê]], the [[Arawaks]] and the Caraibas ([[Caribs]]). The [[Tupi]]-[[Guarani]] nation, originally from the [[Paraná river]] basin and also the main of Native-[[Paraguay]]an nations, had spread all along the Brazilian coastline from South to North and got to be known by the Portuguese as "Os Índios da Língua Geral" ("The Indians of the General Language"); the [[Jê]] nation occupied the most of the interior of the country from [[Maranhão]] to [[Santa Catarina]]. The [[Arawaks]] and the [[Caribs]], the last ones to get in contact with the Portuguese, lived in the North and Northwest of Brazil.

The [[Europe]]an [[immigration to Brazil]] started in the sixteenth century, with the vast majority of them coming from [[Portugal]]. In the first two centuries of colonization, 100,000 Portuguese arrived in Brazil (around 500 colonists per year). In the eighteenth century, 600,000 Portuguese arrived (6,000 per year).<ref>[http://imigrantes.no.sapo.pt/page6brasilEstat.html Sapo.pt] Imigrantes</ref> The first region to be settled by the Portuguese was [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeastern Brazil]], followed by the [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast region]]. The original Amerindian population of Brazil (between two and five million) has in large part been exterminated or assimilated into the Portuguese population.<ref>[http://countrystudies.us/brazil/35.htm Contry Studies] Brazil</ref> The [[Mameluco]]s (or [[Caboclo]]s, a mixed race between [[Whites]] and Amerindians) have always been present in many parts of Brazil.

Another important ethnic group, [[Africa]]ns, first arrived as slaves. Many came from [[Guinea]], or from [[West Africa]]n countries -  by the end of the eighteenth century many had been taken from [[Congo]], [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]] (or, in [[Bahia]], from [[Nigeria]]). By the time of the end of the slave trade in 1850, around three to five million slaves had been brought to Brazil&ndash;37% of all slave traffic between Africa and the Americas. Nowadays, there are still immigration waves coming from the African continent, from countries such as [[Cape Verde]] and [[Sierra Leone]].

The largest influx of European immigrants to Brazil occurred in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. According to the ''Memorial do Imigrante'' statistics data, Brazil attracted nearly 5 million immigrants between 1870 and 1953.<ref name="Memorial 1870/1907">{{cite web |title=Entrada de imigrantes no Brasil - 1870/1907 |date= |url=http://www.memorialdoimigrante.sp.gov.br/historico/e1.htm |language=Portuguese |accessdate=2007-06-20 }}</ref><ref name="Memorial 1908/1953">{{cite web |title=Entrada de imigrantes no Brasil - 1908/1953 |date= |url=http://www.memorialdoimigrante.sp.gov.br/historico/e2.htm |language=Portuguese |accessdate=2007-06-20 }}</ref> These immigrants were divided in two groups: a part of them was sent to [[South Region, Brazil|Southern Brazil]] to work as small [[farm]]ers. However, the biggest part of the immigrants was sent to [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast Brazil]] to work in the [[coffee]] [[plantation]]s. The immigrants sent to Southern Brazil were mainly [[Germans]] (starting in 1824, mainly from [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], [[Pomerania]], [[Hamburg]], [[Westphalia]], etc) and [[Italians]] (starting in 1875, mainly from the [[Veneto]] and [[Lombardia]]). In the South, the immigrants established rural communities that, still today, have a strong cultural connection with their ancestral homelands. In South East Brazil, most of the immigrants were Italians (mainly from the [[Veneto]], [[Campania]], [[Calabria]] and [[Lombardia]]), Portuguese (mainly from [[Beira Alta]], [[Minho (province)|Minho]] and [[Alto Trás-os-Montes]]), [[Spaniards]] (mainly from [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Andalusia]]).

Notably, the first half of the twentieth century saw a large inflow of [[Japanese people|Japanese]] (mainly from [[Honshū]], [[Hokkaidō]] and [[Okinawa]]) and [[Arab]] (from [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]]) immigrants. These Arab immigrants were - and still are - wrongly called "[[Turkish people|Turks]]" by many [[Brazilian]]s because their original countries were still under Turkish rule back in the day Arab immigration to Brazil began. The number of actual [[Turkish people|Turks]] who immigrated to Brazil was in fact very small.

The last PNAD (National Research for Sample of Domiciles) census found Brazil to be made up of 93 million Whites, 80 million brown people, 11.7 million Blacks and 1.3 million Asian or Amerindian.

Compared to other census realized in the last two decades, for the first time the number of White Brazilians did not exceed 50% of the population. In 2000, Whites were 53.7% in the census. In comparison, the number of brown people went up of 38.5% for 43.2% and the Black one from 6.2% to 6.3%.<ref>[http://www.ibge.gov.br/english/presidencia/noticias/noticia_visualiza.php?id_noticia=892&id_pagina=1 News] IBGE</ref> According to the IBGE, this trend is mainly because of the revaluation of the identity of historically discriminated ethnic groups.<ref name="PNAD 2005">{{cite web |title=PNDA Census race |date=2005 |url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/populacao/condicaodevida/indicadoresminimos/sinteseindicsociais2006/indic_sociais2006.pdf |language=Portuguese |accessdate=2007-06-26 }}</ref>

The ethnic composition of Brazilians is not uniform across the country. Due to its large influx of [[European]] [[immigrants]] in the [[19th century]], the [[Southern Brazil|Southern Region]] has a large White majority, composing 80.8% of its population.<ref>[http://www.genealogienetz.de/reg/WELT/brasil.html German Genealogy: Brazil]</ref> The [[Northeastern Brazil|Northeastern Region]], as a result of the large numbers of African slaves working in the [[sugar cane]] [[engenho]]s, has a majority of brown and black peoples, respectively 63.1% and 7%.<ref>[http://www.iei.net/~pwagner/brazarticles/April2002.html Brazil and the African Slave Trade]</ref> [[Northern Brazil]], largely covered by the [[Amazon Rainforest]], is 71.5% brown, due to its strong Amerindian component<ref>[http://www.socioambiental.org/pib/english/source/xi.shtm SocioAmbiental.org]</ref>. [[Southeastern Brazil|Southeast]] and [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Central-Western]] Brazil have a more balanced ratio among different ethnic groups.

According to the [[Constitution of Brazil|Brazilian Constitution]] of 1988, racism is a crime for which [[bail]] is not available, and must be met with imprisonment.

===Emigration===
{{main|Immigration to Brazil}}
In the second half of the [[1980s]], Brazilians from various socioeconomic levels started to emigrate to other countries in search of economic opportunities. High inflation and low economic growth in the 1980s, signs of what became known as the "[[lost decade]]" in [[Latin America]], followed by the government's unsuccessful liberal economic policies in the 1990s, meant that even educated Brazilians could make more money doing low-skilled work abroad.

In the [[1990s]], near 1.9 million Brazilians were living outside the country, mainly in the [[United States]], [[Paraguay]] and [[Japan]]<ref>FT.com, [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/70f96792-360f-11dc-ad42-0000779fd2ac.html "Signs betray ‘hidden workers’ of Japan"], retrieved 20 July 2007.</ref>, but also in [[Italy]], [[Portugal]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[Switzerland]], [[Germany]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Israel]]. However, there were no specific policies implemented by the government to encourage or discourage this emigration process.<ref name="Shaping Brazil">Amaral, Ernesto F. (2005) [http://www.migrationinformation.org/Profiles/display.cfm?id=311 "Shaping Brazil: The Role of International Migration"], Migration Policy Institute website. Retrieved [[13 June]] [[2007]].</ref>

The 2000 Brazilian Census provides some information about the high number of migrants returning to Brazil. Of those who reported residing in another country less than 10 years before the 2000 census, 66.9 percent were Brazilians. If only the returning migrants (former Brazilian immigrants) are considered, 26.8 percent of Brazilians came from Paraguay, 17 percent came from Japan, and 15.8 percent came from the United States.<ref name="Shaping Brazil"/>

===Largest cities===
{{main|List of largest cities in Brazil}}

Cities in Brazil, except for the state of [[São Paulo]], are usually not arranged in a single network, but rather on various ''export paths'' to seaside [[port]]s. Some geographers have called this an "archipelago" of cities <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cafecreole.net/archipelago/Karen_Dialogue.html |title=Karen Dialogue |date= |quote=The Latitude of the Fiction Writer: A Dialogue |accessdate=2007-07-19}}</ref>, and the most important cities are on the coast or close to it. State capitals are also each the largest city in its state, except for [[Palmas]], the new capital of the recently created state of [[Tocantins]], and [[Florianópolis]], the capital of [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]]. There are also non-capital metropolitan areas in [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo state]] ([[Campinas]], [[Santos]] and [[Paraíba Valley]]), [[Minas Gerais]] ([[Vale do Aço|Steel Valley]]), [[Rio Grande do Sul]] ([[Porto Alegre|Sinos Valley]]), and Santa Catarina ([[Vale do Itajaí|Itajaí Valley]]).

São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are far larger than any other Brazilian city. São Paulo's influence in most economic aspects can be noted in a national (and even international) scale; other Brazilian metropolises are second tier, even though Rio de Janeiro - partially due to its former status as the national capital - still host various large corporations' headquarters, besides being the Brazil's cultural center with respect to soap operas and film production.

==Languages==
{{main|Languages of Brazil|Brazilian Portuguese}}

[[Image:Gramado.7.jpg|left|thumb|210px|[[Gramado]], in [[Rio Grande do Sul]], and its typical [[Germany|German]] architecture.]]

[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is the only official language of Brazil. It is spoken by nearly the entire population and is virtually the only language used in schools, newspapers, radio, TV and for all business and administrative purposes. Moreover, Brazil is the only Portuguese-speaking nation in [[the Americas]], making the language an important part of Brazilian national identity.

Portuguese as spoken in Brazil has developed independently of the European mother tongue, and it has undergone fewer phonetic changes than the language spoken in Portugal,<ref>Although Brazilian Portuguese was influenced by the coastal [[Old Tupi language|Tupi language]], African languages brought by slaves, and other immigrant languages, it was isolated from the [[French language|French]] influence on Iberian Portuguese in the eighteen century. See "[http://www.deltatranslator.com/port_lang.htm#7 The Portuguese Language in the Americas]," retrieved [[4 July]] [[2007]].</ref> thus it is often said that the "[[language]] of [[Camões]]", who lived in the fifteenth century, sounded closer to modern Brazilian Portuguese, than to the language spoken in Portugal today, and that his work is poetically more perfect when read the Brazilian way.

Many Amerindian languages are spoken daily in indigenous communities, primarily in Northern Brazil. Although many of these communities have significant contact with Portuguese, today there are incentives for teaching and preserving native languages. According to [[SIL International]], 133 native American languages are currently endangered. Some of the largest indigenous language groups include Arawak, Carib, Macro-Gê and Tupi.<ref>SIL International, [http://www.sil.org/americas/brasil/PortLang.htm "Línguas Indígenas do Brasil"], retrieved 12 June 2007.</ref> In 2006, the City of [[São Gabriel da Cachoeira]] in the region of Cabeça do Cachorro (Northwestern region of the State of [[Amazonas]]), has adopted some indigenous languages as some of its other official languages along with [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].

Other languages are spoken by descendants of immigrants, who are usually bilingual, in small rural communities in Southern Brazil. The most important are the [[Brazilian German]] dialects, such as [[Riograndenser Hunsrückisch]] and the [[Pomeranian language]], and also the [[Talian]], based on the [[Italian Language|Italian]] [[Venetian language]]. In the city of [[São Paulo]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Korean language|Korean]] can be heard in the immigrant neighborhoods, such as [[Liberdade]].

[[English language|English]] is also part of the official high school curriculum in most of the Brazilian states, even though the majority of the population is not fluent. [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is understood to varying degrees by many Brazilians, especially on the borders with Colombia, Peru, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. The same applies to French which is spoken and understood in the cities bordering French Guiana.

==Education and health==
{{main|Education in Brazil|Health care in Brazil}}

The Federal Constitution of [[1988]] and the [[1996]] ''General Law of Education in Brazil'' (LDB) attributed to the Federal Government, [[States of Brazil|states]], [[Brazilian Federal District|Federal District]] and [[List of cities in Brazil|municipalities]] the responsibility of managing the Brazilian educational system, considering three educational public systems as a basis for collaboration between these federal systems. Each of these public educational systems is responsible for its own maintenance, which manages funds as well as mechanisms and sources for financial resources. The new Constitution reserves 25% of state and municipal taxes and 18% of federal taxes for education.<ref>Japan Bank for International Cooperation report, November 2005, [http://www.jbic.go.jp/english/oec/environ/report/pdf/brazil.pdf "Sector Study for Education in Brazil"], retrieved 28 Feb 2007</ref>

As set out by the [[Politics of Brazil|Brazilian Constitution]], the main responsibility for basic education is attributed to the states and municipalities. Hence, a historical feature of Brazilian [[basic education]] is its extremely decentralized nature, which gives great organizational autonomy to sub-national governments (27 states and 5,546 municipalities) in organizing their educational systems. Early childhood education, from 0-6 years, is under exclusive responsibility of the municipalities. Responsibility for compulsory [[primary education]] from 1st to 9th grades is shared between states and municipalities. Kindergarten and pre-school education are the responsibility of local levels of government, whereas secondary schools are under the responsibility of the states. Maintenance of the system, including salaries, the definition of teacher career structures and supervision of early childhood, primary, and secondary levels (which make up basic education) is decentralized, and these levels are responsible for defining their respective curriculum content.

[[Higher education]] starts with undergraduate or sequential courses, which may offer different specialization choices such as academic or vocational paths. Depending on the choice, students may improve their educational background with ''Stricto Sensu'' or ''Lato Sensu'' postgraduate courses. Higher education has three main purposes: teaching, research and extension, each with their own specific contribution to make to a particular course. Diplomas and certificates are proof of having passed through higher education.

In 2003, the literacy rate was at 88 percent of the population, and the youth literacy rate (ages 15–19) was 93.2 percent.<ref>Japan Bank for International Cooperation report, November 2005, [http://www.jbic.go.jp/english/oec/environ/report/pdf/brazil.pdf "Sector Study for Education in Brazil"], retrieved 28 Feb 2007</ref>

According to [[Politics of Brazil|Brazilian Government]], the most serious health problems are:<ref>Ministério do Planejamento website, [http://www.planejamento.gov.br/planejamento_investimento/conteudo/radarsocial/saude.htm "Saúde" (fact sheet, 2002)], retrieved [[12 June]] [[2007]].</ref>
* Childhood mortality: about 2.51% of childhood mortality, reaching 3.77% in the northeast region.
* Motherhood mortality: about 73.1 deaths per 100,000 born children in 2002.
* Mortality by non-transmissible illness: 151.7 deaths per 100,000 habitants caused by heart and circulatory diseases, along with 72.7 deaths per 100,000 habitants caused by cancer.
* Mortality caused by external causes (transportation, violence and suicide): 71.7 deaths per 100,000 habitants (14.9% of all deaths in the country), reaching 82.3 deaths in the southeast region.

==Social issues==
[[Image:Favela do Vidigal.jpg|thumb|right|210px|Entrenched between some of the richer areas of [[Rio de Janeiro]], the [[Vidigal]] ''[[favela]]'' is testimony to high [[economic inequality]] within Brazil.]]

According to [[Fundação Getúlio Vargas]], in June 2006 the rate of poverty based on labour income was of 18.57% of the population — a 19.8% reduction during the previous four years.<ref>Fundação Getúlio Vargas, [http://www.fgv.br/cps/pesquisas/miseria_queda_grafico_clicavel/Grafico_Miseria.pdf "FGV - Gráfico da Miséria", p.23], retrieved [[12 June]] [[2007]]</ref> The rate of poverty is in part attributed to the country's [[economic inequality]]. Brazil ranks among the world's highest nations in the [[Gini coefficient]] index of inequality assessment.

Poverty in Brazil is most visually represented by the various ''[[favela]]s'', [[slum]]s in the country's metropolitan areas and remote upcountry regions that suffer with economic underdevelopment and below-par standards of living. There are also great differences in wealth and welfare between regions.<ref>IBGE website, {{cite web |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title="PIB dos municípios revela concentração e desigualdades na geração de renda" |work= |publisher= IBGE |date= 2000 |url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/presidencia/noticias/noticia_visualiza.php?id_noticia=354&id_pagina=1 |format= |doi= |accessdate=2007-02-22}}</ref> While the Northeast region has the worst [[economic indicator]]s nationwide due to low comprehensiveness and quality of public services, seasonal [[drought]] in rural areas, and widespread [[Political corruption|corruption]], many cities in the South and Southeast enjoy [[First World]] [[socioeconomic]] standards.<ref> [http://www.fundaj.gov.br/docs/pe/pe0114.html Fundação Joaquim Nabuco - Research report]</ref> In 2005, Brazil had more than 15 million (10.2%) people that were considered to be [[Illiteracy|illiterate]].<ref>

A recent attempt to mitigate these problems is the "''[[Fome Zero]]''" hunger-eradication program implemented by President [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]]. Part of this is "''[[Bolsa Família]]''",<ref>World Bank website, [http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2007/05/25/000090341_20070525132633/Rendered/PDF/398530SP1709.pdf ''The Nuts and Bolts of Brazil’s Bolsa Família Program: Implementing Conditional Cash Transfers in a Decentralized Context''], IBRD 2007 paper, retrieved 08 June 2007</ref> a major anti-poverty program that gives money directly to impoverished families.

Violence is also a part of life in Brazil, due to many social issues such as the blatant inequality between haves and have nots, which generates crime and petty thefts. Muggings, robberies and [[kidnapping]]s are quite common in many cities.

==Culture==
{{main|Culture of Brazil}}

[[Image:View of MAC.jpg|thumb|left|210px|The [[Niterói Contemporary Art Museum]], by [[Oscar Niemeyer]].]]

The [[Culture of Brazil|Brazilian culture]] is a [[Latin American culture]] of a very diverse nature. Its chief early influence was [[Culture of Portugal|Portuguese culture]], due to strong colonial ties with the [[Portuguese empire]] that spread the Portuguese language, legal system and other cultural inheritances. Other important influences came from other parts of Europe, the Native South American people (such as the [[Tupi people|Tupi]]), Africa and Asia creating a diverse [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] and [[multiethnic society]].

The core culture of Brazil is rooted in the [[culture of Portugal]]. The Portuguese [[colonist]]s and immigrants brought the [[Roman Catholic]] [[faith]], the Portuguese language and many [[tradition]]s and customs that still influence the modern-day Brazilian culture.

As a [[multiracial]] country, its culture also absorbed other influences. The Amerindian peoples influenced Brazil's language and [[Cuisine of Brazil|cuisine]] and the Africans, brought as slaves, largely influenced [[Music of Brazil|Brazil's music]], [[dance]], cuisine, religion and language. The [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] traditions, from nowadays Southwest [[Nigeria]] had made its way strongly into Afro-Brazilian religion and into Brazilian religiousness as a whole. Ancient [[Yoruba mythology|Yoruba]] [[Orishas]] (gods) like [[Shango]] and [[Oxum]] are largely worshipped in Brazil, while [[samba]] and [[capoeira]] (musical rhythm and martial art, respectively) were originally contributions from the [[Bantus|Bantu peoples]] from [[Angola]] and [[Congo]].

[[Italy|Italian]], [[Germany|German]] and other European [[immigrant]]s came in large numbers and their influences are felt closer to the [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast]] and [[Southern Region, Brazil|South of Brazil]].

[[Brazilian Carnival]] ({{lang-pt|Carnaval}}) is an annual celebration in Brazil held 40 days before [[Easter]] and marks the beginning of [[Lent]]. During Lent, [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]], which constitute the majority in Brazil, are to abstain from bodily pleasures. The carnival, which is celebrated as a profane event, can thus be considered an act of farewell to the pleasures of the flesh. Brazilian Carnival as a whole exhibits some differences with its counterparts in [[Europe]] and other parts of the world, and within Brazil it has distinct regional manifestations. Other regional festivals include the [[Bumba Meu Boi|Boi Bumbá]] and [[Festa Junina]] (''June Festivals'').

Brazil's rich cultural tradition extends to its musical styles, which include [[samba]], [[bossa nova]], [[forró]], [[frevo]], [[maracatu]], among others. Brazilian contributions to the genres of classical music can be seen in the works of composers José Maurício Nunes Garcia (1767-1830), Antonio Carlos Gomes, Elias Álvares Lobo, [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]], Camargo Guarnieri, Cláudio Santoro and Osvaldo Lacerda.

In the 1950's, [[Antônio Carlos Jobim]], [[Vinícius de Moraes]], [[Baden Powell de Aquino]], and [[João Gilberto]] popularized the Bossa Nova style, which was followed by [[Música Popular Brasileira]] (literally "Brazilian Popular Music," often abbreviated to MPB). [[Elis Regina]], [[Milton Nascimento]], [[Chico Buarque]] and [[Nara Leão]] are artists with an important role in shaping the MPB style. In the late 1960s, the [[tropicalismo]] was popularized by [[Caetano Veloso]] and [[Gilberto Gil]].

Brazil has the largest [[Roman Catholicism in Brazil|Roman Catholic]] population in the world.

Followers of [[Protestantism]] are rising in number. Until 1970, the majority of Brazilian Protestants were the ones of "traditional churches", mostly [[Lutheran]]s, [[Presbyterian]]s and [[Baptist]]s. Since then, numbers of [[Pentecostal]] and Neopentecostal adherents have increased significantly.

Subsequently, due to the continental rotation policy taken by FIFA that will place the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] in [[South America]], [[CONMEBOL]] has unanimously nominated Brazil as its candidate to host the 2014 FIFA World Cup, with [[FIFA]] making its final decision sometime in 2008.<ref name="FIFA"/> Also, [[São Paulo]] city organized the [[1963 Pan American Games|IV Pan American Games]] in 1963<ref>{{cite web | title = History | url=http://www.rio2007.org.br/data/pages/8A488A8F12D856280112D88B026B6496.htm | accessdate = 2007-07-29 | publisher=Rio 2007 Games official website }}</ref> and [[Rio de Janeiro]] was hosted the [[2007 Pan American Games|XV Pan American Games]] in 2007<ref>{{cite web | title = Rio 2007 Games official website | url=http://www.rio2007.org.br/data/pages/8A488A8F12D856280112D876FFDA6E31.htm | accessdate = 2007-07-31 }}</ref>.

==Science and technology==
{{main|Science and technology in Brazil}}

[[Image:Marcos Pontes2.jpg|thumb|left|210px|[[Marcos Pontes]], the first Brazilian [[astronaut]] in space.]]

Brazil has today a well developed plan of [[science and technology]]. Basic research is largely carried out in public [[university|universities]] and research centers and institutes, and partly in private institutions, especially in non-profit [[non-governmental organizations]]. Despite governmental regulations and incentives, investment in research and development has been growing in private universities and companies as well since the 1990s. Nonetheless, more than 90% of funding for basic research still comes from governmental sources.<ref>Brazilian Government website, [http://www.brasil.gov.br/ingles/about_brazil/brasil_topics/science/categoria_view "Science and technology"]</ref>

Some of Brazil's most important technological hubs are located in [[São José dos Campos]], [[Campinas]], [[São Carlos]], Rio de Janeiro, [[Curitiba]], [[Porto Alegre]], [[Belo Horizonte]], [[Recife]] and [[São Paulo]].

Brazilian [[information technology]] is comparable in quality to other countries that play a major role in the international market, much like [[India]] and [[China]], but because Brazil possesses a larger internal market, the exports of software are still very limited.<ref>Staub, Eugenio (2004) [http://www.bndes.gov.br/conhecimento/seminario/EugenioStaub.pdf "Panorama da Indústria Brasileira de Eletro-Eletrônica e Software"], BNDES slides.</ref> Catering for the internal market, Brazilian IT is particularly efficient in providing solutions to [[financial services]], [[Defense industry|defense]], [[CRM]], [[eGovernment]], and [[healthcare]]. The Brazilian government as an institution has plans to switch its [[operating system]]s, replacing the current [[proprietary software]] scheme for the [[free software]] scheme.<ref>BBC News website, {{cite news |title=Brazil adopts open-source software |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4602325.stm}}, retrieved 02 June 2005</ref>

Major Brazilian scientific research institutions with worldwide recognition include the [[Oswaldo Cruz Institute]], the [[Butantan Institute]], the [[Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica]] and the [[Brazilian Enterprise of Agropecuary Research]].

The [[Brazilian Space Agency]] (''Agência Espacial Brasileira'') is the civilian authority in Brazil that is in charge of the country's burgeoning space program. It operates a [[Centro de Lançamento de Alcântara|rocket launch site]] at [[Alcântara, Maranhão]].
