The '''Australian Defence Force''' (ADF) is the [[Armed forces|military organisation]] responsible for the defence of [[Australia]]. It consists of the [[Royal Australian Navy]], [[Australian Army]], [[Royal Australian Air Force]] and a number of 'tri-service' units. 

During the first decades of the 20th century, the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] established three separate armed services. Each service had an independent [[chain of command]]. In 1976, the government made a strategic change and established the ADF to place the services under a single headquarters. Over time, the degree of integration has increased and tri-service headquarters, logistics and training institutions have supplanted many single-service establishments. 

The ADF is technologically sophisticated but relatively small. Although the ADF's 51,000 full-time active-duty personnel and 19,400 [[Military reserve force|reservists]] make it the largest military in [[Oceania]], it is much smaller than most [[Asia]]n militaries. Nonetheless, the ADF is able to deploy forces in multiple locations outside Australia.

==Role==
===Legal standing===

The ADF's legal standing draws on the Executive Government sections of the [[Australian Constitution]]. Section 51(vi) gives the [[Government of Australia|Commonwealth Government]] the power to make laws regarding Australia's defence and defence forces. Section 114 of the Constitution prevents the States from raising armed forces without the permission of the Commonwealth and Section 119 gives the Commonwealth responsibility for defending Australia from invasion and sets out the conditions under which the government can deploy the defence force domestically.<ref>Raspal Khosa (2004). ''Australian Defence Almanac 2004–05.'' [[Australian Strategic Policy Institute]], Canberra. Page 4 and Australian Attorney-General's Department [http://scaleplus.law.gov.au/html/pasteact/1/641/top.htm Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act].</ref>

Section 68 of the Constitution sets out the ADF's command arrangements. The Section states that "the command in chief of the naval and military forces of the Commonwealth is vested in the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] as the [[Monarchy in Australia|Queen's]] representative." The Constitution does not mention the Air Force as aircraft had not been invented when it was written. Subsequent legislation places the Air Force under the same command structure. In practice, the Governor General does not play an active part in the ADF's command structure and the elected [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] controls the ADF. The [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for Defence]] and several subordinate ministers [[Civilian control of the military|exercise this control]]. The Minister acts on most matters alone, though the National Security Committee of [[Cabinet of Australia|Cabinet]] considers important matters. The Minister then advises the Governor-General who acts as advised in the normal form of [[executive government]].<ref>Khosa (2004). Page 4.</ref>

===Current priorities===

In 2000, the Australian Government developed a White Paper to guide all aspects of its defence policy. The White Paper sets out and explains the ADF's priorities. The paper states that the ADF has three priorities. The first of these priorities is to maintain the capability to defend Australian territory from any credible attack, without relying on help from the combat forces of any other country. The second priority is to contribute to the security of Australia's immediate neighbourhood through working with neighbouring countries and participating in [[United Nations]]-sanctioned [[peacekeeping]] operations. The third priority for the ADF is to contribute to international coalitions of forces outside of Australia's immediate neighbourhood where Australian interests are engaged. The ADF is also responsible for contributing to coastal surveillance and responding to emergencies, including natural disasters.<ref>Australian Department of Defence (2000). [http://www.defence.gov.au/whitepaper/docs/WPAPER.PDF ''Defence 2000 - Our Future Defence Force'']. Australian Department of Defence, Canberra. Pages 46–53.</ref>

''Australia's National Security. A Defence Update 2007'' is the most recent Australian Government review of its national security policies. This document states that "because of the increasing complexity of the international security environment, Australia must prepare for a range of possible events, both close to home and further afield, with lessened forewarning of crises.".<ref>Australian Department of Defence (2007a). ''[http://www.defence.gov.au/ans/2007/default.htm Australia's National Security. A Defence Update 2007]''. Australian Department of Defence, Canberra. Page 10.</ref> To meet these events it is argued that the ADF must be capable of acting independently within Australia's region to deter or defeat threats to Australia's territory and interests. This includes possessing a capability to conduct military operations at short notice.<ref>Australian Department of Defence (2007a). Pages 26–27.</ref> The document also states that the ADF must be able to make a significant contribution to international coalition operations outside Australia's region. The ADF is not expected to be capable of acting independently outside this region, however.<ref>Australian Department of Defence (2007a). Pages 27–29.</ref> 

==History==
:''Main Articles: [[Military history of Australia]], [[History of the Royal Australian Navy]], [[History of the Australian Army]], [[History of the Royal Australian Air Force]]''
===Formation of the Australian Defence Force===
[[Image:Melbourne Midway small.JPG|thumb|upright|The retirement of [[HMAS Melbourne (R21)|HMAS ''Melbourne'']] without replacement in 1982 marked a shift away from the policy of 'forward defence'.<ref>David Horner (2001). ''Making the Australian Defence Force''. Oxford University Press, Melbourne. Page 55.</ref>]]
Australia has maintained military forces since [[Federation of Australia|federation as a nation]] in January 1901. Upon Federation, the Australian Government established the [[Australian Army]] and Commonwealth Naval Force. In 1909, the Government established the [[Royal Australian Navy]], which absorbed the Commonwealth Naval Force. The Army established the Australian Flying Corps in 1912 although this separated to form the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] in 1921. The services were not linked by a single chain of command, as they each reported to their own separate Minister and had separate administrative arrangements. The three services saw action around the world during [[Military history of Australia during World War I|World War I]] and [[Military history of Australia during World War II|World War II]].

The importance of [[Joint warfare|'joint' warfare]] was made clear to the Australian Military during [[World War II]] when Australian naval, ground and air units frequently served as part of single commands. Following the war, several senior officers lobbied for the appointment of a [[commander in chief]] of the three services. The government rejected this proposal and the three services remained fully independent.<ref> Horner (2001). Page 42.</ref> The absence of a central authority resulted in poor coordination between the services with each service organising and operating on the basis of a different [[military doctrine]].<ref>Horner (2001). Page 44.</ref>

The need for an integrated command structured received more emphasis during [[Military history of Australia during the Vietnam War|the Australian military's experiences in the Vietnam War]].<ref>Horner (2001). Page 44.</ref> In 1973, the Secretary of the [[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]], [[Arthur Tange]], submitted a report to the [[Government of Australia|Government]] that recommended the unification of the separate departments supporting each service into a single Department of Defence and the creation of the post of Chief of the Defence Force Staff. The government accepted these recommendations and the Australian Defence Force was established on 9 February 1976.<ref>Horner (2001). Page 47.</ref>

===Defence of Australia era===
[[Image:Kangaroo 89.jpg|thumb|left|Australian soldiers lead a column of American troops during Exercise Kangaroo '89, which was held in northern Australia.<ref>Horner (2001). Page 65.</ref>]]

Until the 1970s, Australia's military strategy centred on the concept of 'forward defence', in which the role of the Australian military was to cooperate with Allied forces to counter threats in Australia's region. In 1969, when the United States began the [[Guam Doctrine]] and the British withdrew '[[east of Suez]]', Australia developed a defence policy emphasising self-reliance of the Australian continent. This policy was the [[Defence of Australia Policy|Defence of Australia (DOA) Policy]]. Under DOA, the focus of Australian defence planning was to protect Australia's northern maritime approaches (the 'air-sea gap') against enemy attack.<ref>Alex Tewes, Laura Rayner and Kelly Kavanaugh (2004) ''[http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/rb/2004-05/05rb04.htm Australia's Maritime Strategy in the 21st century]''. Australian Parliamentary Library Research Brief no. 4 2004–05.</ref> In line with this goal, the ADF was restructured to increase its ability to strike at enemy forces from Australian bases and to counter raids on continental Australia. The ADF achieved this by increasing the capabilities of the RAN and RAAF and relocating regular Army units to [[northern Australia]].<ref>Horner (2001). Page 72.</ref>

At this time, the ADF had no military units on operational deployment outside Australia. In 1987, the ADF made its first operational deployment as part of [[Operation Morris Dance]], in which several warships and a rifle company deployed to the waters off [[Fiji]] in response to the [[1987 Fijian coups d'état]]. While broadly successful, this deployment highlighted the need for the ADF to improve its capability to rapidly respond to unforeseen events.<ref>Horner (2001). Pages 225–227.</ref> 

Since the late 1980s, the Government has increasingly called upon the ADF to contribute forces to peacekeeping missions around the world. While most of these deployments involved only small numbers of specialists, several led to the deployment of hundreds of personnel. Large peacekeeping deployments were made to [[Namibia]] in early 1989, [[Cambodia]] between 1992 and 1993, [[Operation Solace|Somalia in 1993]], [[Rwanda]] between 1994 and 1995 and [[Bougainville]] in 1994 and from 1997 onwards.<ref>Horner (2001). Pages 228–255.</ref> 

The [[Australian contribution to the 1991 Gulf War]] was the first time Australian personnel were deployed to an active war zone since the establishment of the ADF. Although the warships and [[Clearance Diving Team (RAN)|clearance diving team]] deployed to the [[Persian Gulf]] did not see combat, the deployment tested the ADF's capabilities and command structure. Following the war the Navy regularly deployed a [[List of recent Australian warship deployments to the Middle East|frigate to the Persian Gulf or Red Sea]] to enforce the [[Iraq sanctions|trade sanctions imposed on Iraq]].<ref>Horner (2001). Pages 231–237.</ref>

===East Timor and after===
[[Image:Aust 130.jpg|thumb|A RAAF [[C-130 Hercules]] in the Middle East in late 2003. These aircraft support ADF operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.]]
In 1996, [[John Howard]] led the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]]'s election campaign and became Prime Minister. Subsequently, there were significant reforms to the ADF's force structure and role. The new government's defence strategy placed less emphasis on defending Australia from direct attack and greater emphasis on working in cooperation with regional states and [[Foreign relations of Australia|Australia's allies]] to manage potential security threats.<ref>Australian Army (2002). [http://www.defence.gov.au/ARMY/LWD1/LWD1sitemap.htm ''The Fundamentals of Land Warfare'']. Annex B.</ref> In line with this new focus, the ADF's force structure changed in an attempt to increase the proportion of combat units to support units and to improve the ADF's combat effectiveness.

The ADF's experiences during the [[International Force for East Timor|deployment to East Timor in 1999]] led to significant changes in Australia's defence policies and to an enhancement of the ADF's ability to conduct operations outside Australia. This successful deployment was the first time a large Australian military force had operated outside of Australia since the Vietnam War and revealed shortcomings in the ADF's ability to mount and sustain such operations.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jenny |last=Sinclair |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Operation Chaos |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/11/19/1037490107525.html |work= |publisher=[[The Age]] |date=2002-19-12 |accessdate=2007-07-06 }}.

ANAO, Canberra.</ref> In 2000, the Government released a new Defence White Paper, ''Defence 2000 - Our Future Defence Force'' that placed a greater emphasis on preparing the ADF for overseas deployments. The Government committed to improve the ADF's capabilities by improving the readiness and equipment of ADF units, expanding the ADF and increasing [[Real versus nominal value|real]] Defence expenditure by 3% per year.<ref>Mark Thomson (2005b). [http://www.ada.asn.au/defender/Winter%202005/Easier%20Said%20Than%20Done%20(Defender,%20Winter%202005).pdf 'Easier Said Than Done: At the Six-year Mark in Remaking the ADF'] in ''Defender'', Winter 2005.

Pages 7–8.</ref>

Since 2000, the ADF's expanded force structure and deployment capabilities have been put to the test on a number of occasions. Following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]] on the United States, Australia committed a [[special forces]] task group and an [[air-to-air refuelling]] aircraft to operations in [[Afghanistan]], and naval warships to the [[Persian Gulf]] as [[Operation Slipper]]. In 2003, approximately 2000 ADF personnel, including a special forces task group, three warships and 14 [[F/A-18 Hornet]] aircraft, took part in the [[Australian contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]]. Later in 2003, elements of all three services deployed to the [[Solomon Islands]] as part of the [[Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands]]. In late 2004, over 1000 ADF personnel deployed to Indonesia in [[Operation Sumatra Assist]] following the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]].<ref>Australian Minister for Defence media release [http://www.minister.defence.gov.au/HillTpl.cfm?CurrentId=4739 ''ADF Head Home from Aceh'']. 24 March 2005.</ref> In May 2006, approximately 2000 ADF personnel deployed to [[Timor Leste]] (East Timor) in [[Operation Astute]] following unrest between elements of the [[Timor Leste Defense Force]]. 

===Current operations===
{{main|Current Australian Defence Force deployments}}
[[Image:ADF Deployments June 2007.PNG|thumb|ADF deployments as at June 2007. Deployments of over 1000 personnel are coloured red, deployments of between 999 and 101 personnel are coloured orange and deployments of 100 or fewer personnel are coloured blue.]]
In July 2007 around 3850 Australian Defence Force personnel were deployed on overseas operations. An additional 450 personnel were also deployed on domestic maritime security tasks.<ref>Australian Department of Defence. [http://www.defence.gov.au/globalops.cfm Global Operations]. Accessed 4 July 2007.</ref> While these deployments have placed pressure on some elements of the military, and particularly the Army, the ADF is not currently 'overstretched'.<ref>Mark Thomson (2007).

Page 11.</ref>

The ADF currently has two-large scale deployments in the [[Middle East]]. The ADF's contribution to the rehabilitation of [[Iraq]], [[Operation Catalyst]], forms the largest ADF deployment. As of July 2007, 1575 ADF personnel were deployed to the Middle East as part of this operation. The other main ADF operation in the Middle East is [[Operation Slipper]], Australia's contribution to the [[War on Terrorism|international coalition against terrorism]]. In July 2007 approximately 970 ADF personnel were also deployed as part of this operation.<ref>Australian Department of Defence. [http://www.defence.gov.au/opslipper/default.htm Operation Slipper]. Accessed 16 May 2007.</ref> The Australian force in Afghanistan will be expanded to more than 1000 personnel over 2007 and 2008.<ref>{{cite press release

ADF units are currently deployed on two operations in Australia's immediate neighbourhood. Approximately 1100 personnel, most of whom form part of the joint Australia-New Zealand [[ANZAC Battle Group]], are deployed to [[Timor Leste]] on peacekeeping duties as part of [[Operation Astute]]. A rifle company group of 140 personnel is also deployed in the Solomon Islands as the ADF's contribution to the [[Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands]].<ref>Australian Department of Defence. [http://www.defence.gov.au/globalops.cfm Global Operations]. Accessed 4 July 2007.</ref>

===Future trends===

Australia's changing security environment will lead to new demands being placed on the Australian Defence Force. Although it is not expected that Australia will face any threat of direct attack, [[terrorist]] groups and tensions between nations in [[East Asia]] pose threats to Australian security. The unstable governments in many South Pacific countries may lead to some of these countries becoming [[Failed state|'failed states']] in the future. Such 'failed states' may require military-led interventions to restore civil government.<ref>Australian Department of Defence (2007a). Pages 13–23.</ref>

[[Demographics of Australia|Australian demographic trends]] will put pressure on the ADF in the future.<ref>Ken Henry (2005) [http://www.ada.asn.au/defender/Summer%2005-06/Australia's%20Defence%20to%202045%20(Henry).pdf 'Australia's Defence to 2045: The Macro-economic Outlook'] in ''Defender'', Spring 2005. Page 19.</ref> Excluding other factors, the aging of the Australian population will result in smaller numbers of potential recruits entering the Australian [[labour market]] each year. Some predictions are that population aging will result in slower economic growth and increased government expenditure on pensions and health programs. As a result of these trends, the aging of Australia's population may worsen the ADF's manpower situation and may force the Government to reallocate some of the Defence budget.<ref>Henry (2005). Pages 22–23.</ref> In addition, the current labour shortages across much of the [[Economy of Australia|Australian economy]] may frustrate the ADF's expansion plans and delay the introduction of new equipment.<ref>{{cite news |first=Brendan  |last=Nicholson |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Defence force revamp falters |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/defence-force-revamp-falters/2007/06/11/1181414218880.html |work=[[The Age]] |publisher= |date=2007-06-12 |accessdate=2007-06-12 }}</ref>

The increasing cost of defence equipment also poses a challenge to the ADF. The [[Australian Strategic Policy Institute]] estimates that the cost of purchasing and operating the equipment in the ''Defence Capability Plan'' may exceed the projected Defence Budget. If additional resources are not made available to correct this funding shortfall the government may be forced to reduce the ADF's size.<ref>Thomson (2006a)</ref>

The ADF has developed strategies to respond to Australia's changing strategic environment and population base. These strategies include expanding the ADF and introducing new equipment in order to increase Australia's 'strategic weight'. To maintain Australia's qualitative lead over neighbouring states the ADF intends to introduce new technologies and maintain the high quality of Australian military training. The ADF is also seeking to develop and implement improved military tactics based upon the integration of technology and better cooperation between the services.<ref>Australian Department of Defence (2006a). ''[http://www.aph.gov.au/house/committee/jfadt/esstrends/subs/sub7.pdf Submission to the Joint Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Inquiry into the Economic, Social and Strategic Trends in Australia’s Region and the Consequences for Our Defence Requirements]''. Australian Department of Defence. Canberra. Pages 11–14.</ref>

==Current structure==
[[Image:ADF chiefs.jpg|thumb|The current commanders of the ADF. Left to Right: Air Marshal [[Geoffrey Shepherd]] (CAF), Lieutenant General [[Peter Leahy]] (CA), Air Chief Marshal [[Angus Houston]] (CDF), Lieutenant General [[Ken Gillespie]] (VCDF) and Vice Admiral [[Russ Shalders]] (CN)]]
The Australian Defence Force and [[Department of Defence (Australia)|Australian Department of Defence]] together make up the [[Australian Defence Organisation]] (ADO). A [[diarchy]] of the [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of the Defence Force]] and the Secretary of Defence administers the ADO. The ADF is the military component of the ADO and consists of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), the Australian Army and the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). The Department of Defence is staffed by both [[civilian]] and military personnel and includes agencies such as the [[Defence Intelligence Organisation]] (DIO), the [[Defence Materiel Organisation]] (DMO) and the [[Defence Science and Technology Organisation]] (DSTO). The DMO purchases and maintains defence equipment. The DSTO provides science and technology support to the defence forces.

===Command arrangements===
The Chief of the Defence Force (CDF) is the most senior appointment in the ADF. The CDF commands the ADF under the direction of the [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister of Defence]] and is notionally the equal of the Secretary of Defence, the most senior public servant in the Department of Defence. The CDF is the only four-star officer in the ADF and is a [[General]], [[Admiral]] or [[Air Chief Marshal]]. Hugh White, a prominent academic and former Deputy Secretary in the Department of Defence, has criticised the ADF's current command structure. White argues that the Minister plays too large a role in military decision-making and does not provide the CDF and Secretary of Defence with necessary and sufficient authority to manage the ADO effectively.<ref>{{cite news |first=Hugh |last=White  |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The real battle is far from the battlefield |url=http://www.lowyinstitute.org/PublicationGet.asp?i=403 |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |publisher= |date=2006-05-25 |accessdate=2007-06-23 }}</ref>

Under the current ADF command structure the day-to-day management of the ADF is distinct from the command of military operations.<ref>Khosa (2004). Page 14.</ref> The services are administered through the Australian Defence Organisation, with the head of each service (the [[Chief of Navy (Australia)|Chief of Navy]], [[Chief of Army (Australia)|Chief of Army]] and [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of Air Force]]) and the service headquarters being responsible for raising, training and sustaining combat forces. The Chiefs are also the Government's principal advisor on matters concerning the responsibilities of their service.<ref>Horner (2001). Page 187.</ref> 
[[Image:ADF Command Structure 2004.PNG|thumb|left|The ADF's operational command structure from 2004-1 July 2006<ref>Australian minister for Defence media release [http://www.minister.defence.gov.au/Hilltpl.cfm?CurrentId=3657 Changes to Australian Defence Force Higher Command Arrangements]. 16 March 2004. Accessed 15 July 2007.</ref>]]

While the individual members of each service ultimately report to their service's Chief, the Chiefs do not control military operations. Control of ADF operations is exercised through a formal command chain headed by the Chief of Joint Operations (CJOPS), who reports to the CDF. As part of this structure each service is organised into an administrative headquarters (Navy, Army and Air Force headquarters) which supports the service Chief and an operational command (Fleet Headquarters, Land Command and Air Command) which report to the respective service Chief but are responsive to CJOPS. The Navy and Army also have a training command which reports to the head of the respective service (the RAAF's Training Group has formed part of Air Command since 2006). Several 'joint' operational task forces also report to CJOPS. In practice, when ADF units deploy on exercises or operational deployments they are temporarily re-assigned from their respective service to the relevant operational headquarters.<ref>Khosa (2004). Page 14.</ref>

Other countries with integrated military command structures comparable to Australia's include Canada ([[Canadian Forces]]), Britain ([[British Armed Forces]]) and New Zealand ([[New Zealand Defence Force]]).

===Joint combat forces===
Operational command of the ADF is exercised by [[Headquarters Joint Operations Command (Australia)|Headquarters Joint Operations Command]] (HQJOC), which is currently located in Canberra. This command was initially established as Headquarters Australian Theatre in 1997 and was re-designated in 2004.<ref>Horner (2001). Page 139.</ref> The Vice-Chief of Defence Force has the additional responsibility of Chief of Joint Operations, directing the JOC. 

The ADF has a number of permanent joint operational commands responsible to the Vice-Chief of Defence Force. Joint Logistics Command is responsible for managing the ADF's logistics, which it achieves through regional Joint Logistics units and contracts with private companies.<ref>Australian Department of Defence (2004). [http://www.defence.gov.au/budget/04-05/dar/05_06_vcdf01.htm ''Defence 2004–05 Annual Report'' - Chapter 5].

===Royal Australian Navy===
{{main|Royal Australian Navy}}
The Royal Australian Navy (RAN) is the [[navy|naval branch]] of the Australian Defence Force. The RAN operates over 50 vessels, including [[frigate]]s, [[submarine]]s, [[patrol boat]]s and auxiliary ships. The RAN is one of the most modern navies in the Pacific and is responsible for defending Australian waters and undertaking operations in distant locations.<ref>Royal Australian Navy (2006) ''[http://www.navy.gov.au/publications/navytoday/may2006/navy_today_2006_may.pdf Australia's Navy Today]''.

There are two parts to the RAN's structure. One is an operational command, Fleet Headquarters, and the other is a support command, Navy Systems Command.<ref>Sea Power Centre - Australia (2005). Pages 33–36.</ref> The Navy's assets are administered by seven Force Element Groups (FEGs), which report to the Commander Australian Fleet. The seven FEGs are: Australian Navy Surface Combatants Force, Amphibious Warfare Forces along with the Afloat Support Force, [[Fleet Air Arm (RAN)|Naval Aviation Force]], [[Royal Australian Navy Submarine Service|Australian Navy Submarine Force]], Mine Warfare and Clearance Diving Forces, [[Australian Patrol Boat Group|Australian Navy Patrol Boat Force]] and the [[Royal Australian Navy Hydrographic Service|Australian Navy Hydrographic Force]].<ref>Royal Australian Navy.

===Australian Army===
{{main|Structure of the Australian Army}}
[[Image:Australia Land Forces.png|thumb|The Australian Army's structure in early 2007]]

The Australian Army is Australia's military land force. While the Australian Army is principally a [[light infantry]] force, it is currently being 'hardened and networked' and expanded to enable it to conduct higher-intensity operations.<ref>Australian Army [http://www.defence.gov.au/ARMY/HNA/Home.htm The Hardened and Networked Army]. Accessed 17 December 2006.</ref>   

Land Command is the authority responsible for the operations of Australian land forces and has its headquarters in [[Sydney]]. The organisation of the Australian Army's combat forces is as follows. There are two high-readiness regular [[brigade]]s, one combined regular-reserve brigade, six [[Australian Army Reserve|Army Reserve]] brigades, an aviation brigade and a logistics brigade.<ref>Australian Department of Defence (2006).

===Royal Australian Air Force===
{{main|Structure of the RAAF}}
The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) is the [[air force]] branch of the Australian Defence Force. The RAAF has modern [[Military aircraft|combat]] and [[Cargo aircraft|transport aircraft]] and a network of bases in strategic locations across Australia.

Unlike the other services, the RAAF has only a single operational command, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]], which includes the [[RAAF Training Command|Air Force Training Group]]. Air Command is the operational arm of the RAAF and also consists of the [[Air Combat Group RAAF|Air Combat Group]], [[Air Lift Group RAAF|Air Lift Group]], [[Surveillance and Response Group RAAF|Surveillance and Response Group]], [[Combat Support Group RAAF|Combat Support Group]] and [[Aerospace Operational Support Group RAAF|Aerospace Operational Support Group]]. Each group consists of a number of [[Wing (air force unit)|wings]]. The RAAF currently has [[List of Royal Australian Air Force aircraft squadrons|seventeen flying squadrons]]; four combat squadrons, two maritime patrol squadrons, five transport squadrons, five training squadrons (including three [[Operational Conversion Unit|operational conversion unit]]s) and one [[Airborne Early Warning & Control]] squadron, which is currently forming. A large number of ground support units support these flying squadrons, including three expeditionary combat support squadrons, three [[Airfield Defence Guards|airfield defence squadrons]] and communications, radar and medical units.<ref>''Jane's World Air Forces''.

The Australian Defence Force's logistics are managed by the Defence Material Organisation and the Joint Logistics Command. The DMO was created in 2000 by merging the ADF's Support Command Australia with the Department of Defence's Defence Acquisition Organisation and National Support Division.<ref>Horner (2001). Page 278–279.</ref> The DMO purchases all forms of equipment and services used by the ADF and is also responsible for maintaining this equipment throughout its life of type.

Page 273.</ref> 

The increasing role of the [[private sector]] forms an important trend in the ADF's logistics arrangements. During the 1990s many of the ADF's support functions were transferred to the private sector to improve the efficiency with which they were provided. Since these reforms most of the 'garrison' support services at military bases have been provided by [[Private military company|private firms]]. The reforms also led to many of the ADF's logistics units being disbanded or reduced in size.<ref>Horner (2001). Pages 265–279.</ref> Private firms have increasingly been contracted to provide critical support to ADF units deployed outside Australia. This support has included transporting equipment and personnel and constructing and supplying bases.<ref>Mark Thomson (2005).

==Military intelligence==
[[Image:RAAF radar.jpg|thumb|One of the RAAF's mobile [[AN/TPS-77]] radars]]

The Australian Defence Force's [[Military intelligence|intelligence]] collection and analysis capabilities are considerable. These capabilities include each of the services' intelligence systems and units, two joint civilian-military [[List of intelligence gathering disciplines|intelligence gathering]] agencies and two strategic and operational-level [[intelligence analysis]] organisations.

Each of the three services has its own intelligence assets.<ref>Horner (2001). Page 150.</ref> RAN doctrine states that "all maritime units" contribute to the collection of intelligence and many of the RAN's ships are capable of collecting communications and electronic transmissions.

Issue 24 August 2006. Jane's Information Group. Coulsdon. Pages 23–26.</ref>

The [[Defence Intelligence Group|Defence Intelligence and Security Group]] within the Department of Defence supports the services. This Group consists of the [[Defence Imagery and Geospatial Organisation]] (DIGO), [[Defence Signals Directorate]] (DSD) and [[Defence Intelligence Organisation]] (DIO). The DIGO is responsible for [[GEOINT|geospatial intelligence]] and producing maps for the ADF, the DSD is Australia's [[SIGINT|signals intelligence]] agency and the DIO is responsible for the analysis of intelligence collected by the other intelligence agencies.<ref>Australian Government (2006) [http://www.ona.gov.au/publications/files/ONA%20Booklet%20(WEB).pdf ''The Australian Intelligence Community.

===Personnel numbers===

In the 2006–2007 financial year, the ADF had an average strength of 51,447 permanent (full-time) and 19,562 reserve (part-time) personnel. The Army is the largest service, followed by the RAAF and RAN. In that time, the ADO also employed an average of 14,516 civilian members of the [[Australian Public Service]] (APS) and 810 professional service providers.<ref>Australian Department of Defence (2007b).

Under current Government policies the ADF will expand to 57,000 full time personnel. This will require around 6,500 recruits each year. While ADF membership decreased by 891 personnel between 2003–2004 and 2005–2006,<ref>Mark Thomson (2006). ''[http://www.aspi.org.au/htmlver/25983Your_Defence$06/index.html Your Defence Dollar: The 2006–07 Defence Budget]''. Australian Strategic Policy Institute, Canberra. Page 4.</ref> the ADF expanded by 361 personnel over 2006-07. In the 2006–2007 financial year the ADF enlisted 4,955 permanent personnel and 2,893 reservists. These numbers fell short of the ADF's recruitment targets and represent 84% of the permanent force recruitment target and 89% of the reserve force target. This represented an overall improvement on the achievements against the targets for the 2006–2007 financial year (84% and 77% respectively), however.<ref>Australian Department of Defence (2007b). Pages 132-133.</ref> During 2006–2007 11.2% of ADF personnel left the military.<ref>Australian Department of Defence (2007b). Page 136.</ref>

The ADF is suffering serious shortfalls in some categories of skilled personnel. The Navy and Army are short of medical personnel, engineers, linguists and junior personnel with technical qualifications. The RAAF states that its personnel situation is sound.<ref>{{cite news |first=Julian |last=Kerr |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Hard cash fights the brain drain|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21754673-5002142,00.html |work= |publisher=[[The Australian]] |date=2007-26-05 |accessdate=2007-07-02 }}</ref> The strong civilian labour market is one cause of these shortages.

The Government has introduced new policies to increase recruitment and reduce the ADF's separation rate. These policies include reforms to speed the recruitment process, the relaxation of some minimum standards for recruits and the introduction of retention bonuses for personnel in critical positions and with important skills.<ref>Prime Minister of Australia media release, [http://pm.gov.au/news/media_Releases/media_Release2307.html Reforms to Boost ADF Recruitment and Retention], 15 December 2006.</ref> The 2007–2008 Commonwealth Budget also provided increased funding to advertise the ADF as an employment option and attract apprentices to the services.<ref>Australian Department of Defence (2007).

===Training===

Individual training of Australian servicemen and women is generally provided by the services in their own training institutions. Each service has its own training organisation which manages this individual training. Where possible, however, individual training is increasingly being provided through tri-service schools.<ref>Horner (2001). Page 281.</ref>

Military academies include [[HMAS Creswell]] for the Navy, [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] for the Army, and the Officer Training School - [[RAAF Base Williams]] for the Air Force. The [[Australian Defence Force Academy]] is a Tri-Service university for officer cadets of all services wishing to attain a university degree through the Australian Defence Force. Navy [[recruit training]] is conducted at [[HMAS Cerberus]], Army recruits are trained at the [[Army Recruit Training Centre]] and Air Force recruits at [[RAAF Base Edinburgh]].<ref>Horner (2001). Pages 294–301.</ref>

===Women in the ADF===
[[Image:050615-N-6811L-040-s.jpg|thumb|A member of the Army's 26th Transport Squadron with her truck]]

Women first served in the Australian military during World War II when each service established a separate female branch. The RAAF was the first service to fully integrate women into operational units, doing so in 1977, with the Army and RAN following in 1979 and 1985 respectively.<ref>Horner (2001). Pages 321–324.</ref> The ADF initially struggled to integrate women, with integration being driven by changing Australian social values and Government legislation rather than a change in attitudes within the male-dominated military.<ref>Joan Beaumont (2001). ''Australian Defence Sources and Statistics''. Oxford University Press, Melbourne. Page 357.</ref> 

The number of positions available to women in the ADF has increased over time. Although servicewomen were initially barred from combat positions, these restrictions began to be lifted in 1990.<ref>Australian Parliamentary Library [http://www.aph.gov.au/library/intguide/fad/women_armed.htm Women in the armed forces: the role of women in the Australian Defence Force]. Accessed 16 December 2006.</ref> In 2006 approximately 97% of employment categories in the ADF were available to females as well as males. The only positions which women are currently excluded from are those in which there is a high probability of 'direct combat', which includes all [[infantry]] positions and other positions in which there is a high probability of [[hand to hand combat]].<ref>Defence Jobs [http://www.defencejobs.gov.au/default.asp?p=33&IntCatID=9 Frequently Asked Questions - Gender Restrictions]. Accessed 16 December 2006.</ref> As a result, while almost all positions in the Navy and Air Force are open to women, women are excluded from a high proportion of Army positions.<ref>Khosa (2004). Page 52.</ref> 

Despite the expansion in the number of positions available to women, there has been only limited growth in the percentage of female permanent defence personnel. In the 1989–1990 financial year women filled 11.4% of permanent ADF positions. In the 2005–2006 financial year women occupied 13.3% of permanent positions and 15.6% of reserve positions. During the same period the proportion of civilian positions filled by women in the Australian Defence Organisation increased from 30.8% to 40.3%.<ref>Khosa (2004).

In relative terms, Australia's defence expenditure as a proportion of GDP is greater than that of most developed Western nations, but is smaller than the proportion allocated to defence by Australia's larger neighbours. However, as Australia's GDP is larger than those of its neighbours, Australia actually spends more on Defence in dollar terms.<ref>Mark Thomson (2005).

''[http://www.defence.gov.au/dmo/id/dcp/dcp.cfm 2006-16 Defence Capability Plan: Public Version].'' DMO, Canberra. Page iii.</ref>

The largest projects that the DCP sets out are the replacement of the RAAF's combat aircraft (almost certainly with up to 100 [[F-35 Lightning II]] aircraft), the [[Hobart class destroyer|air warfare destroyer]] project, the replacement of the RAAF's maritime patrol aircraft, the replacement of the RAN's anti-submarine helicopters, the replacement of the ADF's entire fleet of field vehicles and the purchase of two [[Canberra class large amphibious ship|large amphibious ships]]. Other significant purchases that the DCP sets out include the purchase of [[NHI NH90|MRH-90]] transport helicopters for the Army and Navy and [[M1A1 Abrams]] tanks to reequip the Army's [[1st Armoured Regiment (Australia)|only armoured regiment]].<ref>Defence Materiel Organisation (2006).

The ADF has also been funded to purchase equipment that the DCP will not provide. These include the acquisition of 24 [[F/A-18F Super Hornet]] fighter aircraft, four [[C-17 Globemaster III]] transport aircraft and the equipment needed to implement the 'Hardened and Networked Army' initiative.<ref>Thomson (2006).

The Australian Defence Force maintains bases in all the [[states and territories of Australia]].<ref>See page 42 of Australian Department of Defence [http://www.defence.gov.au/budget/05-06/dar/downloads/2005-2006_Defence_DAR_21_additional.pdf ''2005–06 Defence Annual Report - Web Section''] for the locations of the main ADF bases and training areas.</ref>  While most of the Army's permanent force units are based in [[northern Australia]], the majority of Navy and Air Force units are based near [[Sydney]], [[Brisbane]] and [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]]. Few ADF bases are currently shared by different services. The only permanent ADF base outside Australia is located at [[RMAF Base Butterworth|Royal Malaysian Air Force Base Butterworth]].

The administrative headquarters of the ADF and the three services is located in [[Canberra]] alongside the main offices of the Department of Defence and Defence Materiel Organisation and the interim headquarters of Joint Operations Command. JOC and the other operational headquarters will be co-located near [[Bungendore, New South Wales]] as part of the Headquarters Joint Operations Command Project.<ref>Australian Department of Defence, [http://www.defence.gov.au/id/hqjoc/purpose.htm Headquarters Joint Operations Command Project - Project Purpose]. Accessed 25 May 2007.</ref>

The Royal Australian Navy has two main bases; [[Fleet Base East]] in Sydney and [[Fleet Base West]] near [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]]. The Navy's operational headquarters, Fleet Headquarters, is located adjacent to Fleet Base East. The majority of the Navy's [[patrol boat]]s are based at [[HMAS Coonawarra|HMAS ''Coonawarra'']] in [[Darwin, Northern Territory]] with the remaining patrol boats and the hydrographic fleet being based at [[HMAS Cairns (naval base)|HMAS ''Cairns'']] located at [[Cairns, Queensland]]. The [[Fleet Air Arm (RAN)|Fleet Air Arm]] is based at [[HMAS Albatross (air station)|HMAS ''Albatross'']] near [[Nowra, New South Wales]].<ref>Royal Australian Navy (2006). Pages 44–47.</ref>

The Australian Army's regular units are concentrated in a small number of bases, most of which are located in Australia's northern states. The Army's operational headquarters, Land Command, is located at [[Victoria Barracks, Sydney|Victoria Barracks]] in Sydney. Most elements of the Army's three regular brigades are based at [[Robertson Barracks]] near Darwin, [[Lavarack Barracks]] in [[Townsville, Queensland]] and [[Gallipoli Barracks]] in Brisbane. The Deployable Joint Force (Land) Headquarters is also located at Gallipoli Barracks. Other important Army bases include the [[Oakey Army Aviation Centre|Army Aviation Centre]] near [[Oakey, Queensland]], [[Holsworthy Barracks]] near Sydney, [[Woodside Barracks]] near [[Adelaide, South Australia]] and [[Campbell Barracks (Australia)|Campbell Barracks]] in Perth. Dozens of [[Australian Army Reserve|Army Reserve]] depots are located across Australia.<ref>Australian Department of Defence [http://www.defence.gov.au/budget/05-06/dar/downloads/2005-2006_Defence_DAR_21_additional.pdf ''2005–06 Defence Annual Report - Web Section'']. Page 42.</ref>

The Royal Australian Air Force maintains a number of air bases, including three which are only occasionally activated. The RAAF's operational headquarters, [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]], is located at [[RAAF Base Glenbrook]] near Sydney. The Air Force's combat aircraft are based at [[RAAF Base Amberley]] near [[Ipswich, Queensland]], [[RAAF Base Tindal]] near [[Katherine, Northern Territory]] and [[RAAF Base Williamtown]] near [[Newcastle, New South Wales]]. The RAAF's maritime patrol aircraft are based at [[RAAF Base Edinburgh]] near Adelaide and most of its transport aircraft are based at [[RAAF Base Richmond]] in Sydney. RAAF Base Edinburgh is also home to the control centre for the [[Jindalee Operational Radar Network]]. Most of the RAAF's training aircraft are based at [[RAAF Base Pearce]] near Perth with the remaining aircraft located at [[RAAF Base East Sale]] near [[Sale, Victoria]] and RAAF Base Williamtown. The RAAF also maintains a network of bases in northern Australia to support operations to Australia's north. These bases include [[RAAF Base Darwin]] and [[RAAF Base Townsville]] and three [[RAAF Bare Bases|'bare bases']] in [[Queensland]] and [[Western Australia]].<ref>''Jane's World Air Forces''.

==Domestic responsibilities==

The Australian Defence Force has a number of domestic responsibilities. In most of these tasks the ADF supports the relevant civilian authorities. These responsibilities are typically undertaken by specialised elements of the ADF, though the services' combat elements can be deployed within Australia in response to major emergencies.

The ADF makes a significant contribution to Australia's domestic maritime security. ADF ships, aircraft and [[Regional Force Surveillance Units]] conduct patrols of northern Australia in conjunction with the [[Australian Customs Service]]. This operation, which is code-named [[Operation Resolute]], is commanded by the [[Border Protection Command (Australia)|Border Protection Command]] which is jointly manned by members of the ADF and Customs. Approximately 450 personnel were assigned to Operation Resolute in July 2007.<ref>Australian Department of Defence. [http://www.defence.gov.au/opresolute/ Operation Resolute]. Accessed 4 July 2007.</ref>

While the ADF does not have a significant nation-building role, it provides assistance to remote [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous Australian]] communities. Since 1996 the Army has regularly deployed engineer units to assist remote communities. Under this program a single [[Royal Australian Engineers|engineer squadron]] works with one community for several months each year to upgrade the community's infrastructure and provide training.<ref>Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Indigenous Affairs media release [http://www.atsia.gov.au/media/media06/171106.aspx Army celebrates 10 years of service to Indigenous communities]. 17 November 2006.</ref> The ADF has also taken part in the intervention in remote Northern Territory Indigenous communities since late June 2007. The ADF provides logistical support to the Northern Territory Emergency Response Task Force and has helped assess the communities' needs.<ref>Australian Department of Defence [http://www.defence.gov.au/opoutreach/default.htm Operation Outreach]. Accessed 16 December 2007.</ref>

The ADF shares responsibility for [[counter-terrorism]] with civilian law enforcement agencies. Under the Australian National Counter-Terrorism Plan the [[Law enforcement in Australia|State and Territory police]] and emergency services have the primary responsibility for responding to any terrorist incidents on Australian territory. If a terrorist threat or the consequences of an incident are beyond the capacity of civilian authorities to resolve the ADF may be [[Military Aid to the Civil Power|'called out']] to provide support. In order to meet its counter-terrorism responsibilities the ADF maintains two elite [[Tactical Assault Group (Australia)|Tactical Assault Groups]], the [[Australian Incident Response Regiment|Incident Response Regiment]] and a company-sized high readiness group in each [[Australian Army Reserve|Army Reserve]] brigade and the [[1st Commando Regiment]].<ref>The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (2004). ''[http://www.dpmc.gov.au/publications/protecting_australia/docs/protecting_australia.pdf Protecting Australia Against Terrorism]''. DPMC, Canberra.

The ADF provides assistance to militaries in Australia's region through the Defence Cooperation Program. Under this program the ADF provides assistance with training, infrastructure, equipment and logistics and participates in joint exercises with countries in South East Asia and Oceania. The [[Pacific Patrol Boat Program]] is the largest Defence Cooperation activity and supports 22 patrol boats operated by twelve South Pacific countries.<ref>Khosa (2004). Page 85.</ref> A performance audit of the Defence Cooperation Program conducted in 2001 found that while Defence does not adequately monitor the Program's performance, it was "valued highly by participating countries".<ref>[[Australian National Audit Office]] (2001).

==Assessment of capabilities==
[[Image:HMAS Wewak.jpg|thumb|Australian and US soldiers disembarking from [[HMAS Wewak (L 130)|HMAS ''Wewak'']] in 2001.]]
The Australian Defence Force's capabilities enable it to carry out a range of tasks. The size of the force that the government can deploy differs according to the likelihood of high-intensity combat and the distance from Australia. In overall terms, Dr. Mark Thomson of the [[Australian Strategic Policy Institute]] assesses the ADF's size and capability as being typical for a [[Western world|Western]] nation with Australia's economic and population base.<ref>Thomson (2005). Page 10.</ref> The ADF has probably the most capable air and naval capabilities in the South-East Asia region. However, the small size of the Army and the age of much of the RAN and RAAF's equipment constrains Australia's ability to make large-scale deployments or engage in high-intensity combat.<ref>Mark Thomson (2003) ''[http://www.aspi.org.au/publications/publication_details.aspx?ContentID=33&pubtype=1 Pay Your Money & Take Your Pick: Defence Spending Choices for Australia]''. Australian Strategic Policy Institute, Canberra. Page 17.</ref> The ADF's personnel shortages may also limit its ability to quickly conduct new deployments.<ref>Gregor Ferguson 'People and Logistics is the Key'. ''Australian Defence Magazine'', June 2007. Page 18.</ref>

The ADF is highly capable of defeating direct attacks on Australia by conventional forces, though such attacks are highly improbable at present. The ADF's intelligence gathering capabilities should enable it to detect any attacking force before it reaches Australia. Once detected, the RAN and RAAF would be able to defeat the attacking force while it was still in Australia's maritime approaches. The Army and RAAF are also capable of defeating small raiding forces once they are detected.<ref>Thomson (2003). Page 16.</ref> The ADF currently maintains sufficient forces to meet its domestic security and counter-terrorism responsibilities.<ref>Smith and Bergin (2006). Page 15.</ref>

The ADF does not currently possess the resources that a prolonged large-scale deployment with high-intensity warfare would require. Although the RAN and RAAF are capable of deploying significant numbers of capable ships and aircraft, these forces are neither large nor modern enough to operate independently in a high-threat environment and would typically make up a small part of a larger international coalition force. Due to its relatively small size and lack of firepower the Army's capability for high intensity warfare presents is even more limited than that of the other services. As a result of these limitations, the ADF is capable of providing only relatively small, but high-quality, 'niche' forces for high intensity warfare. Such forces include the Navy's submarines, the Army's special forces and the RAAF's Orion aircraft.<ref>Thomson (2003). Pages 13–14. See also Horner (2001) page 202.</ref> However, the ADF's logistic capabilities are insufficient to independently supply such forces deployed in areas distant from Australia. As a result, the ADF can only contribute forces to high intensity warfare outside of Australia's region when larger coalition partners provide logistical support.<ref>Albert Palazzo (2004). 'Organising and Dispatching the ADF's Expeditionary Force for the War in Iraq' in ''Battles Near and Far: A Century of Overseas Deployment. The Chief of Army Military History Conference 2004.'' Army History Unit, Canberra. Page 267.</ref>

The ADF is highly capable of undertaking peacekeeping operations around the world. The Navy's frigates and transport ships, the Army's light infantry battalions and the RAAF's transport aircraft are well-suited to peacekeeping. The ADF has the capability to undertake peacekeeping and low-intensity warfare operations independently in Australia's region and can sustain such deployments for a lengthy period. It is also capable of leading international peacekeeping forces in the Asia-Pacific region.<ref>Thomson (2003). Pages 14–16.</ref>

Although the ADF's capacity to participate in high-intensity warfare is limited, the Government does not presently require that the military possess such capabilities. The information released in the ''Defence Annual Report'' indicates that the ADF consistently meets most of the readiness targets which are set by the Government. The ADF's performance in meeting the Government's requirements improved between 2000–01 and 2005–06, with the majority of these targets being met. The only readiness targets to be consistently missed over this period were those set for the Army Reserve and the Army's logistic support forces.<ref>Thomson (2006). Pages 26–27.</ref>
