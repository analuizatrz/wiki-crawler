The '''Tennessee Public Service Commission''' was a three-member elected body which regulated private [[utility|utilities]], [[truck]]ing firms, and [[railroad]]s within the state of [[Tennessee]].

The body was comprised of three commissioners, one from each of the state's three "Grand Divisions" ([[East Tennessee|East]], [[Middle Tennessee|Middle]], and [[West Tennessee]]).  While one member of the body was required to be from each Grand Division, each was [[election|elected]] on a statewide basis to staggered six-year terms, resulting in the election of one commissioner in each even-numbered year.  This body was somewhat less powerful than some similar bodies in most other states in that, with the exception of the [[Kingsport, Tennessee|Kingsport]] area, it had no jurisdiction over electric rates since the vast majority of the state received its power from the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]], which as part of the [[United States Government]] was not subject to state regulation.  

Once the [[Tennessee Supreme Court]] was changed to being confirmed by a yes-no vote (the "Modified [[Missouri Plan]]" or "[[Tennessee Plan]]") rather than being chosen by an acutal [[political party|partisan]] election, the PSC comprised the only statewide elected positions in Tennessee other than [[governor]].  During the entire life of the body, all of its members were [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].  The process was notoriously tainted by allegations of corruption.  The general public showed very little interest in the office, despite its potential for considerable impact on their daily lives, with total votes cast in races for the office often amounting only to two-thirds or less of the numbers cast for governor, [[United States Senate|senator]], or [[President of the United States|President]] in the same election, and most people largely or entirely unaware of the duties and functions of the commission.  Nearly all [[campaign finance|campaign donations]] came from the industries which were regulated by the PSC, their representatives, and persons involved with them.  No one was ever elected to higher office from the Tennessee Public Service Commission, although such attempts were occasionally made.

This apparently-corrupt process, linked to the fact that, as noted above, no [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] was ever elected to the office, led the administration of [[governor of Tennessee|Governor]] [[Don Sundquist]] to move to abolish the office in [[1995]], and it was subsequently replaced with the [[Tennessee Regulatory Authority]], with one member each appointed by the [[Governor]], the [[Lieutenant Governor of Tennessee|Lieutenant Governor]], and the [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] of the [[Tennessee House of Representatives]].
