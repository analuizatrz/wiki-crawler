The main campus is located less than a mile from the [[Texas State Capitol]] in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]. Founded in 1883, the university is considered a "[[Public Ivy]]" and had [[List of largest United States universities by enrollment|the fifth largest]] single-campus enrollment in the nation as of fall 2006 (and had the largest enrollment in the country from 1997&ndash;2003), with nearly 50,000 undergraduate and graduate students and 20,000 faculty and staff.<ref>[http://www.utexas.edu/opa/pubs/facts/enrollment.html Enrollment & Essentials] ''The University of Texas Office of Public Affairs.'' Accessed [[1 December]] [[2005]].</ref>  It currently holds the largest enrollment of all colleges in the state of Texas.

The university also operates various auxiliary facilities aside from the main campus, most notably the [[J.J. Pickle Research Campus]]. Texas is a major center for academic research, annually exceeding $380 million in funding. In addition, the university's notable athletic programs were recognized by ''[[Sports Illustrated]],'' which dubbed UT as "America's Best Sports College" in 2002.

UT has over 450,000 living alumni<ref>[http://www.utexas.edu/welcome/profile.html Campus Profile] ''The University of Texas.'' Accessed [[1 December]] [[2005]].</ref>, and has had [[Nobel Prize laureates by university affiliation|8 Nobel Laureates affiliated with it]].

==History==
{{main|History of The University of Texas at Austin}}
[[Image:Oldmainbuilding.jpg|right|250px|thumbnail|The University's old Main Building in 1903.]]
The first mention of a public university in Texas can be traced to the 1827 constitution for the [[Mexico|Mexican]] state of [[Coahuila y Texas]]. Although an article promised to establish public education in the arts and sciences, no action was ever taken by the Mexican government. After Texas gained its independence from Mexico in 1836, the Congress of Texas adopted the [[Constitution of the Republic of Texas|Constitution of the Republic]], which included a provision to establish public education in [[Republic of Texas|republic]], including two universities or colleges. On [[January 26]], [[1839]], Congress agreed to eventually set aside fifty [[league (unit)|league]]s of land towards the effort; in addition, forty acres in the new capital of Austin were reserved and designated "College Hill".

In 1846, Texas was annexed into the [[United States]]. The state legislature passed the [[Act of 1858]], which set aside $100,000 in United States [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] towards construction. In addition, the legislature designated land, previously reserved for the encouragement of railroad construction, toward the universities' fifty leagues. However, Texas's [[secession]] from the Union and the [[American Civil War]] prevented further action on these plans.

After the war, the [[Texas Constitution of 1866]] mandated that the state establish a university "at an early day." The passing of the [[Morrill Act]] in 1862 facilitated the creation of [[Texas A&M University]], which was established in 1871 as the Agricultural & Mechanical College of Texas.<ref>[http://www.tsha.utexas.edu/handbook/online/articles/TT/kct8.html Texas A&M University] ''Handbook of Texas Online.'' Accessed [[29 July]] [[2006]].</ref> During the construction of Texas A&M, the [[Texas Constitution of 1876]] called for the creation of a "university of the first class", The University of Texas. It revoked the endowment of the railroad lands of the Act of 1858 but appropriated one million acres (4000 km²)  in West Texas. In 1883, another two million were granted, with income from the sale of land and [[grazing rights]] going to The University of Texas and Texas A&M. 

In 1881, Austin was chosen as the site of the main university, and Galveston was designated the location of the medical department. On the original "College Hill", an official ceremony began construction on what is now referred to as the old Main Building in late 1882. The university opened its doors on [[September 15]], [[1883]].

The old [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]]-[[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic]] [[Main Building of the University of Texas at Austin|Main Building]] served as the central point of the campus's forty acre site, and was used for nearly all purposes. However, by the 1930s, discussions rose about the need for new library space, and the Main Building was razed in 1934 over the objections of many students and faculty. The modern-day tower and Main Building were constructed in its place.

Constitutional restrictions against funding building construction hampered expansion. However, the funds generated by [[petroleum|oil]] discovered on university-owned grounds in 1923 were put towards its general endowment fund. This extra revenue allowed the university to pay down its debt, and pass bond in 1931 and 1947, funding the necessary expansion after the enrollment spike following [[World War II]]. The university built 19 permanent structures between 1950 and 1965, when it was given the right of [[eminent domain]]. With this power, the university purchased additional properties surrounding the original forty acres.

On [[August 1]] [[1966]], [[Charles Whitman]], an [[architectural engineering]] major at the university, barricaded himself in the observation deck of the tower of the Main Building with a [[sniper rifle]] and various other weapons. In a 96-minute stand-off, Whitman killed 15 people and wounded many more.<ref>{{cite web | title=After decades of silence, UT acknowledged shootings | first=Victoria | last=Rossi | date=[[August 1]], [[2006]] | publisher=[[Daily Texan]] | url=http://media.www.dailytexanonline.com/media/storage/paper410/news/2006/08/01/TowerMassacre40YearsLater/After.Decades.Of.Silence.Ut.Acknowledged.Shootings-2142759.shtml | accessdate=2006-08-01}}</ref> Following the incident, the observation deck was closed until 1968 and closed again in 1975 following a series of [[suicide]] jumps. In 1998, after the installation of security and safety measures, the observation deck reopened to the public.<ref>[http://www.utexas.edu/student/txunion/ae/towertours/?tours=schedule Tower Tours Schedule Fall 2005] ''The Texas Union.''

==Campus==
[[Image:uttower1.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The University of Texas Tower (foreground).]]

Today, the university encompasses about 350 acres (1.4 km²) on its main campus adjacent to downtown Austin and about 850 acres (3.4 km²) overall, including the [[J.J. Pickle Research Campus]] in north Austin and other properties in Austin and throughout Texas.

One of the university's most visible features is the [[Main Building of The University of Texas at Austin|Main Building]], including a 307-foot tower designed by [[Paul Philippe Cret]].<ref>[http://www.utexas.edu/tours/mainbuilding/ The Main Building] ''The University of Texas.'' Accessed [[1 December]] [[2005]].</ref> Completed in 1937, the Main Building is located in the middle of campus. The tower usually appears illuminated in white light in the evening but is lit orange for various special occasions, including athletic victories and academic accomplishments, such as commencement. The tower is darkened for solemn occasions.<ref>[http://www.utexas.edu/opa/pubs/oncampus/02oc_issues/oc020129/oc_tower.html University approves new policy for lighting UT Tower] ''On Campus.'' Accessed [[1 December]] [[2005]].</ref> At the top of the tower is a [[carillon]] of 56 bells, the largest in Texas. Songs are played on weekdays by resident carillonneur Tom Anderson, in addition to the usual pealing of [[Westminster Quarters]] every quarter hour between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m.

The university is home to seven museums and seventeen libraries, which hold over eight million volumes.<ref>[http://www.lib.utexas.edu/admin/cird/statisticaloverview2005.html Statistical Overview of the Library Collections] ''The University of Texas Libraries.'' Accessed [[1 December]] [[2005]].</ref> The holdings of the university's [[Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center]] include one of only twenty-one remaining complete copies of the [[Gutenberg Bible]] worldwide and the world's earliest-known photograph: ''View from the Window at Le Gras'' taken by [[Nicéphore Niépce]].<ref>[http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/exhibitions/permanent/gutenberg/ The Gutenberg Bible at the Ransom Center] ''Harry Ransom Center.'' Accessed [[1 December]] [[2005]].</ref> On [[April 29]], [[2006]], the [[Blanton Museum of Art]] opened.  The 155,000 square foot (14,000 m²) museum hosts approximately 17,000 works from Europe, the United States, and Latin America. 

The university also contains an extensive underground [[tunnel]] system that links many of the buildings.<ref>[http://www.betterthanyourboyfriend.com/the-secret-tunnels-under-ut.htm The Secret Tunnels Under UT] ''Better Than Your Boyfriend.''</ref> The tunnel system is closed to the public and is guarded by [[burglar alarm|silent alarms]]. The tunnels are used for communications and utility service.

The university operates a 1.1 megawatt [[nuclear reactor]] at the J.J. Pickle Research Campus. The university's first reactor went critical, at Taylor Hall on the main campus, in August 1963 at 10 kW using fuel loaned from the [[federal government of the United States|U.S. Government]]. This reactor was upgraded to 250 kW in 1968.<ref>[http://www.me.utexas.edu/~nuclear/about.htm Nuclear Engineering Teaching Lab] ''Nuclear and Radiation Engineering Program.'' Accessed [[10 February]] [[2006]].</ref> In the late 1980s, the university began work on the reactor for the Nuclear Engineering Teaching Lab at the Pickle Campus. This reactor went critical in 1992, despite local news reports on its safety.<ref>Collier, Bill. UT reactor draws safety questions. ''[[Austin American-Statesman]]''. [[December 15]], [[1989]].</ref>

The university continues to expand facilities on the campus. In February 2006, the Board of Regents voted to update and expand the football stadium. On [[March 2]], [[2006]], the student body passed a referendum to build a new Student Activities Center next to Gregory Gym on the east side of campus, pending final approval by the Board of Regents. According to ''The Daily Texan'', the project is estimated to cost $51 million and is set to open between fall 2010 and fall 2012. Funding will primarily come from students, raising tuition by a maximum of $65 per semester.<ref>Terrell, Abby.

===Faculty and research===
[[Image:Utcampus night.JPG|right|thumb|250px|The Robert Lee Moore Building (left), the Molecular Biology Building (middle), and the Neuromolecular Sciences Building (right).]]
As of 2004, the university employed 2,271 faculty members. Approximately 51.1% were [[tenure]]d, while an additional 17.8% were tenure track. The university's faculty includes winners of the [[Nobel Prize]], the [[Pulitzer Prize]], the [[National Medal of Science]], the [[National Medal of Technology]], and numerous other awards. Over 1,000 faculty positions are endowed by private funds. Since 1984, more than forty $1 million-endowed chairs have been created at The University of Texas to recruit distinguished faculty and facilitate research in the sciences and engineering.

The university exceeds $380 million in annual research funding, and its facilities house more than 90 research units. UT has earned more than 400 patents since its founding. In 2005, Texas secured $417 million in awards and grants, a new university record. In addition, Texas earned $5 million in licensing revenue and capped a six-year funding increase of 48%. The university has also reached out to establish partnerships with other facilities, including the [[University of Texas Medical Branch]] in Galveston, the [[UTHSCSA|University of Texas Health Science Center]], the [[Johnson Space Center]] of the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]], the [[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory]], and the International Center for Nanotechnology and Advanced Materials.<ref>[http://www.utexas.edu/research/about/2005report/ Report on Research 2005] ''The University of Texas Office of the VP for Research.'' Accessed [[December 2]], [[2005]].</ref>

In addition to research in traditional fields, scientists are pushing forward in several new, interdisciplinary areas, including nanotechnology and materials engineering for next-generation semiconductors. In addition, Texas is advancing high performance computing through the [[Texas Advanced Computing Center]] (TACC), which supports over 600 projects in the natural sciences, engineering, and business.

The university's library system ranks sixth among academic libraries in the nation with 7.5 million volumes.<ref>[http://www.libraryspot.com/lists/listlargestlibs.htm Nation's Largest Libraries by Volumes Held] ''LibrarySpot''. Accessed [[December 23]], [[2005]].</ref> The main campus library is the [[Perry-Castañeda Library]].

===Endowment===
{{main|Permanent University Fund}}

The university receives income from an endowment known as the [[Permanent University Fund]] (PUF), with $11.6 billion ([[List of US colleges and universities by endowment|fourth]]-largest in the [[United States]]) in assets as of November 2005,<ref name="endowment">{{cite web|year=[[2006]]|url=http://www.nacubo.org/x2321.xml|title=2005 NACUBO Endowment Study|publisher=National Association of College and University Business Officers|accessdate=2006-05-25}}</ref> of which 30 percent is dedicated to the university.<ref name="30-percent">As required by the Texas Constitution[http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/txconst/sections/cn000700-001800.html], the UT System gets two-thirds of the [[Available University Fund]], the annual distribution of PUF income. A regental policy[http://www.utsystem.edu/OGC/RegentalPolicies/AUFspend.htm] requires that ''at least'' 45 percent of this money go to UT Austin for "program enrichment." By taking two-thirds and multiplying it by 45 percent, we get 30 percent which is the ''minimum'' amount of AUF income that can be distributed to UT Austin under current policies. The Regents, however, can and do decide to allocate additional amounts to UT Austin. Also, the majority of the UT System share of the AUF is used for debt service of UT System [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], some of which were issued for the benefit of UT Austin[http://www.utsystem.edu/CONT/REPORTS/LARs/AUFLAR-102704.pdf]. One should note that the Regents are free to change the 45 percent minimum of the UT System share going to UT Austin at any time, although doing so might be difficult politically.</ref> Proceeds from lands appropriated in 1839 and 1876, as well as oil monies, comprise the majority of this fund. At one time, the PUF was the chief source of income for Texas's two university systems, The University of Texas System and [[Texas A&M University System|The Texas A&M University System]]; today, however, its revenues account for less than 10  percent of the universities' annual budgets. This has challenged the universities to increase sponsored research and private donations. Privately funded endowments contribute over $2 billion to the University's total endowment value.

==Student life==
[[Image:Hookemhorns.jpg|right|250px|thumbnail|A student giving the [[Hook 'em Horns]] hand gesture at a [[Texas Longhorn Athletics|Longhorn]] football game.]]

==UT in popular culture==
On ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' episode 30.10, Amy Poehler impersonating [[Jenna Bush]], mocks her sister by saying, “I went to UT” then does the “Hook ‘em” sign.

The feature film ''[[Man of the House]]'' starring Tommy Lee Jones has his character as a Texas Ranger protecting the UT cheerleaders after they witnessed a murder.

On ''[[Ugly Betty]]'' episode 1.7, [[Vanessa L. Williams|Vanessa Williams]] character Wilhelmina Slater has to impress a potential buyer from Texas (played by [[Brett Cullen]]) and decorates her office with Texas décor. He notices the longhorn on her wall and asks, “You went to UT Austin?” Slater says her assistant went to UT. The assistant Marc, who did not attend UT, responds by saying, "Yes I did. It was so southern. Go Longhorns! Yay! God bless America." Instead of showing the "Hook ‘em" gesture, Marc shows the [[shaka sign]].

In ''[[Road Trip]]'' starring Breckin Meyer and Seann William Scott, the college buddies journey from Ithaca to see a girlfriend who attends the "University of Austin." No such school exists with this name and the university did not approve the movie to be shot on campus after reading the script. However exterior scenes showing the UT Tower, campus exit sign and the "Drag" which runs next to the campus were shot.

[[Kevin Spacey]] portrays the title character in ''[[The Life of David Gale]]'', a "University of Austin" professor who is an advocate for the abolishment of capital punishment and falsely convicted of rape and murder of another activist. This film was shot primarily on the UT campus with students used as extras.

Matthew McConaughey, a popular film actor, is an alum of the University of Texas and an avid football fan. He rarely misses a game and can be seen talking to fans and is very popular amongst the students. When McConaughey was arrested on [[October 24]], [[1999]] at this home in Austin, Texas after a phone call was made for a loud disturbance, it was the talk of campus that he was celebrating until the early AM hours with friends after the #18 ranked Longhorns defeated #3 Nebraska 24-20 on [[October 23]], [[1999]]. In a press conference following his release, he was wearing a UT burnt orange jacket while speaking to the media. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/486051.stm]

The growing [[independent film]] community in Austin has increased the reputation of the Radio-Television-Film (RTF) program as a [[film school]]. The department has capitalized on this recent growth, and has begun a private production company, [http://www.burntorangeproductions.com/ Burnt Orange Productions], seeking to use the talents of upper-division and graduate RTF students in shooting independent films for [[distribution (film)|distribution]]. The first movie to be released by the company was 2005's [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0414951/ The Quiet], with 3 more films slated for release soon.

The University of Texas offers a wide variety of varsity and intramural sports programs. Due to the breadth of sports offered and the quality of the programs, Texas was selected as "America's Best Sports College" in a 2002 analysis performed by ''[[Sports Illustrated]].''<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/si_online/news/2002/10/01/1_10/ America's Best Sports Colleges] ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''. [[October 7]], [[2002]].</ref>

===Varsity sports===
The university's men's and women's athletics teams are nicknamed the Longhorns. A charter member of the [[Southwest Conference]] until its dissolution in 1996, Texas now competes in the [[Big 12 Conference]] (South Division) of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA's]] [[Division I-A]].  Texas has won 47 total national championships<ref> [http://www.texassports.com/index.php?s=&change_well_id=2&url_article_id=101 Texas Longhorns Championships History:  National Champions] ''TexasSports.com''. [[March 20]], [[2007]]</ref>, 39 of which are NCAA national championships.<ref> [http://www.ncaa.org/champadmin/champs_listing1.html Schools with the Most National Championships] ''NCAA.org''. [[Autumn|Fall]] [[2006]]</ref>

The University of Texas has traditionally been considered a [[college football]] powerhouse. The team experienced its greatest success under coach [[Darrell Royal]], winning three national championships in 1963, 1969, 1970, and winning a fourth title under head coach [[Mack Brown]] in 2005 after the 41-38 victory over previously undefeated [[University of Southern California|Southern California]] in the 2006 [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]].

In recent years, the men's [[college basketball|basketball]] team has gained prominence, advancing to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] Sweet Sixteen in 2002, the Final Four in 2003, the Sweet Sixteen in 2004, and the [[Elite Eight]] in 2006.

The university's [[college baseball|baseball]] team is considered one of the best in the nation with more trips to the [[College World Series]] than any other school, with wins in 1949, 1950, 1970, 1983, 2002 and 2005.

===Rivalries===
The university's major rival in almost every sport is generally considered to be [[Texas A&M Athletics|Texas A&amp;M University]].<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/magazine/features/si50/states/texas/ Sports Illustrated's 50th Anniversary: Texas] ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' poll (conducted by [[Harris Interactive]]) shows 56% of respondents picked Texas vs Texas A&M as the biggest rivalry, followed by Texas vs Oklahoma at 15%, and the Cowboys vs Texans at 7%.</ref> The two schools have acknowledged the importance of this rivalry by creating the [[State Farm]] [[Lone Star Showdown]] series, which encompasses all sports where both schools field a varsity team. The football game played between the two schools is the third longest-running rivalry in the nation and is the longest-running rivalry for both schools. The game used to be played on Thanksgiving day but in recent years has been played on the day following [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]]. Both schools traditionally hold a rally each year before the football game &mdash; Texas hosts the [[Hex Rally]], and students at Texas A&M host the [[Aggie Bonfire#Revival|Aggie Bonfire]].

Many fans and observers, however, argue that the Longhorns' biggest rival in football is the [[University of Oklahoma]].<ref>[http://totaljibbly.blogspot.com/2005/11/season-it-never-fails.html The Season] ''Total Jibbly''. [[November 22]], [[2005]].</ref> The football game between Texas and Oklahoma is known as the [[AT&T]] [[Red River Shootout|Red River Rivalry]] and is held annually in [[Dallas, Texas]] at the [[Cotton Bowl (stadium)|Cotton Bowl]].  In recent years, this rivalry has been particularly spirited, in part due to the fact that at least one school had been ranked in the top 5 nationally at the time of the game.

Many other schools, such as [[University of Arkansas|Arkansas]] and [[Texas Tech]], also consider Texas among their biggest rivals.<ref>[http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaaf/preview?gid=200610280086 Texas Longhorns/Texas Tech Raiders Preview Saturday, October 28, 2006] ''[http://sports.yahoo.com/ Yahoo!
