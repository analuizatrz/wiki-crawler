The '''Zambezi''' (also spelled '''Zambesi''') is the fourth-longest [[river]] in [[Africa]], and the largest flowing into the [[Indian Ocean]]. The area of its [[drainage basin|basin]] is [[1 E12 m²|1,570,000&nbsp; km²]] (606,000&nbsp;[[square mile|miles²]]), slightly less than half that of the [[Nile]]. The 2,574&nbsp;km (1,600 mile) long river has its source in [[Zambia]] and flows through [[Angola]], along the border of [[Namibia]], [[Botswana]], Zambia and [[Zimbabwe]], to [[Mozambique]], where it empties into the Indian Ocean.

The Zambezi's most spectacular feature is [[Victoria Falls]], the world's largest [[waterfall]]s. Other notable falls include the [[Chavuma Falls]] at the border between Zambia and Angola, and [[Ngonye Falls]], near [[Sioma]] in Western Zambia. Over its entire course, the Zambezi is spanned by only five bridges: at [[Chinyingi]], [[Katima Mulilo]], [[Victoria Falls]], [[Chirundu]] and [[Tete]].

There are two main sources of [[hydroelectric]] power on the river.  These are the [[Kariba Dam]], which provides power to Zambia and Zimbabwe and the [[Cabora-Bassa]] Dam in [[Mozambique]] which provides power to [[South Africa]]. There is also a smaller power station at Victoria Falls.

==Course==
===Source===
The river rises in a black marshy [[bog]] in north-western [[Zambia]], in undulating forested hills about 1,500&nbsp;metres (4,900 ft) above [[sea level]]. Eastward of the source the [[drainage basin|watershed]] between the [[Congo River|Congo]] and Zambezi basins is a well-marked belt of high ground, falling abruptly north and south, and running nearly east-west between 11 and 12°&nbsp;S. This distinctly cuts off the basin of the [[Luapula]] (the main branch of the upper Congo) from that of the Zambezi. In the neighbourhood of the source the watershed is not as clearly defined, but the two river systems do not connect.

===The upper river===
After flowing to the south-west for about 240&nbsp;km (150&nbsp;miles), the river turns south, and is joined by many [[tributary|tributaries]]. A few miles above [[Kakengi]], the river widens from 100 to 350&nbsp;metres (330 to 1,150 ft), and below Kakengi are a number of [[rapids]] ending in the [[Chavuma Falls]], where the river flows through a rocky fissure. The first of its large tributaries to enter the Zambezi is the [[Kabompo River]] in the north-western province of Zambia. A little further south is the [[Confluence (geography)|confluence]] with the much larger [[Lungwebungu River]]. The [[savanna]] through which the river has flowed gives way to a more open bush valley, studded with Borassus [[palm tree]]s. Dense vegetation is confined to narrow strips of matted forest which skirt the first few hundred metres of the sources of the Zambezi and its tributaries during the first 160&nbsp;km (100 miles) or so.

[[Image:Zambezi River near Zambezi Town.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Zambezi River in North Western Zambia]]

From 1500&nbsp;metres (4,900 ft) at the source, the river drops to about 1100&nbsp;metres (3,600 ft) at Kakengi, 350&nbsp;km (220&nbsp;miles) downstream. From this point until the [[Victoria Falls]], the level of the basin is very uniform, dropping only by another 180 metres (590 ft). Thirty kilometers (19 miles) below the confluence of the Lungwebungu the country becomes flat, and in the [[rainy season]] is largely covered by [[flood]]s. Eighty kilometers (50&nbsp;miles) further down, the [[Luanginga]], which with its tributaries drains a large area to the west, joins the Zambezi. A few kilometres higher up on the east the main stream is joined by the [[Luena River|Luena]].

A short distance downstream of the confluence with the Luanginga is [[Lealui]], one of the capitals of the [[Lozi people]] who populate the semi-[[Autonomous entity|autonomous]] Zambian region of [[Barotseland]]. The chief of the Lozi has two compounds, the other being at [[Limulunga]]. Limulunga is on high ground and serves as the capital during the rainy season. The annual move from Lealui to Limulunga is a major event, celebrated as one of Zambia's best known festivals, the [[Kuomboka]].

After Lealui, the river turns to the south-east. From the east it continues to receive numerous small streams, but on the west is without tributaries for 240&nbsp;km (150&nbsp;miles), when the [[Cuando River]] joins it. Before this, the [[Ngonye Falls]] and subsequent rapids interrupt navigation. South of Ngonye Falls, the river briefly borders [[Namibia]]'s [[Caprivi Strip]]. The strip projects from the main body of Namibia, and results from the colonial era: it was added to [[German South-West Africa]] expressly to give [[Germany]] access to the Zambezi.

Below the junction of the Cuando and the Zambezi the river bends almost due east. Here, the river is very broad and shallow, and flows fairly slowly, but as it flows eastward towards the border of the great central plateau of Africa it reaches a chasm into which the [[Victoria Falls]] plunge.

===The middle Zambezi===
[[Image:Victoria5.jpg|Victoria Falls, the end of the upper Zambezi and beginning of the middle Zambezi|thumb|right|250px]]

The Victoria Falls are considered the boundary between the upper and middle Zambezi. Below them the river continues to flow due east for about 200&nbsp;km (120&nbsp;miles), cutting through perpendicular walls of [[basalt]] 20 to 60&nbsp;metres (65 to 200 ft) apart in hills 200 to 250&nbsp;metres (650 to 820 ft) high. The river flows swiftly through the gorge, the current being continually interrupted by reefs. Beyond the gorge are a succession of [[rapids]] which end 240&nbsp;km (150&nbsp;miles) below Victoria Falls. Over this distance, the river drops 250 metres (820 ft).

At this point, the river enters [[Lake Kariba]], created in 1959 following the completion of the [[Kariba Dam]]. The lake is one of the largest man-made lakes in the world, and the [[hydroelectric]] power-generating facilities at the dam provide electricity to much of Zambia and [[Zimbabwe]].

The [[Luangwa]] and the [[Kafue]] are the two largest left-hand tributaries of the Zambezi. The Kafue joins the main river in a quiet deep stream about 180&nbsp;metres (590 ft) wide. From this point the northward bend of the Zambezi is checked and the stream continues due east. At the confluence of the Luangwa (15°37&prime;&nbsp;S) it enters [[Mozambique]].

The middle Zambezi ends when the river enters Lake [[Cahora Bassa]] (also spelled Cabora Bassa). Formerly the site of dangerous rapids known as Kebrabassa, the lake was created in 1974 by the construction of the Cahora Bassa Dam.

===The lower river===
The lower Zambezi's 650&nbsp;km (400&nbsp;miles) from Cahora Bassa to the Indian Ocean is navigable, although the river is shallow in many places during the [[dry season]]. This shallowness arises as the river enters a broad valley and spreads out over a large area. Only at one point, the [[Lupata Gorge]], 320&nbsp;km (200&nbsp;miles) from its mouth, is the river confined between high hills. Here it is scarcely 200 metres wide. Elsewhere it is from 5 to 8&nbsp;km (3 to 5&nbsp;miles) wide, flowing gently in many streams. The river bed is sandy, and the banks are low and reed-fringed. At places, however, and especially in the [[rainy season]], the streams unite into one broad fast-flowing river.

[[Image:Zambezi_delta.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Zambezi's delta]]

About 160&nbsp;km (100&nbsp;miles) from the sea the Zambezi receives the drainage of [[Lake Malawi]] through the [[Shire River]]. On approaching the Indian Ocean, the river splits up into a number of branches and forms a wide [[river delta|delta]]. Each of the four principal mouths, Milambe, Kongone, Luabo and Timbwe, is obstructed by a sand bar. A more northerly branch, called the Chinde mouth, has a minimum depth at low water of 2&nbsp;metres at the entrance and 4&nbsp;metres further in, and is the branch used for navigation. 100&nbsp;km (60&nbsp;miles) further north is a river called the [[Quelimane]], after the town at its mouth. This stream, which is silting up, receives the overflow of the Zambezi in the rainy season. The delta of the Zambezi is today about half as broad as it was before the construction of the Kariba and Cahora Bassa dams controlled the seasonal variations in the flow rate of the river.

The region drained by the Zambezi is a vast broken-edged plateau 900–1200&nbsp;metres high, composed in the remote interior of [[metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] beds and fringed with the [[igneous]] rocks of the Victoria Falls. At [[Shupanga]], on the lower Zambezi, thin strata of grey and yellow [[sandstone]]s, with an occasional band of [[limestone]], crop out on the bed of the river in the dry season, and these persist beyond [[Tete]], where they are associated with extensive seams of [[coal]]. Coal is also found in the district just below the Victoria Falls. [[Gold]]-bearing rocks occur in several places.

==Tributaries==
The Zambezi has numerous tributaries. Some of the more important ones are described here, in order from source to sea.

The [[Kabompo]] rises in the high land which forms the eastern watershed between the Zambezi and [[Congo River|Congo]] systems. It is formed itself by the confluence of the upper Kabompo and the somewhat larger [[Lunga River]], and flows into the Zambezi north of the town of [[Lukulu]]. The [[Lungwebungu]], which enters the Zambezi from the west just south of the confluence with the Kabompo River, is 200 metres wide in its upper course, flowing in a valley bordered by white sand covered in thin forest, its floor forming at times an inundated plain 2 to 3 miles wide.

The [[Cuando River]], largest of the river's western tributaries, has the ruined capital of the [[Makololo]] people on its lower reaches. It rises in [[Angola]], and forms the border between Zambia and Angola for part of its course, before curving to the south, then flowing east into the Zambezi. In this eastward stretch the Cuando flows through a vast reedy [[swamp]] studded with alluvial islands for 110&nbsp;km (70 miles), and at its most southern bend is joined by the [[Magwekwana]], which in time of flood receives some of the surplus water of the [[Okavango]]. This surplus water, received after most of the flood water of the Cuando has passed, raises the level of the lake and holds up the waters of the Cuando for some miles above it.

The largest tributary of the middle Zambezi, the [[Kafue]], rises in Zambia's [[Copperbelt Province]] near the border with [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] at an elevation of 1350 metres in thick forest country. The main headstream is later joined by the [[Lunga River]] or Luanga. The [[Itezhi-Tezhi Dam]] is an important source of [[hydroelectric]] power from the Kafue River, and the river also supports a great deal of wildlife, which is protected by Zambia's largest [[national park]], [[Kafue National Park]]. The lower Kafue has a series of [[waterfall]]s and cataracts, dropping several hundred feet in 25&nbsp;km (15 miles).

The next large tributary to the east is the [[Luangwa]], which rises near the north-west corner of [[Lake Malawi]] and in its upper course runs parallel to its western shores. The Luangwa flows in a generally level valley, bounded by steep plateau escarpments, and is generally shallow and rapid, though fairly wide. Its tributaries the [[Lunsemfwa River]] and [[Lukasashi River]] drain a large area of the western plateau of Zambia. The Luangwa joins the Zambezi a little above the town of [[Zumbo]]. The Luangwa Valley is an important wildlife conservation area, and contains [[North Luangwa National Park]] and [[South Luangwa National Park]]. The Luangwa defines the border between Zambia and Mozambique for about 75&nbsp;km before it joins the Zambezi.

From the south the middle Zambezi receives various rivers which water northern [[Zimbabwe]]&mdash;the [[Shangani]], [[Sanyati]], and [[Hanyani]], besides minor streams. The [[Mazoe]], which rises in [[Mashonaland]], joins the Zambezi below the Cahora Bassa Dam.

==Exploration of the river==
[[Image:Satellite_view_of_Victoria_Falls.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Satellite image showing [[Victoria Falls]] and subsequent series of zigzagging gorges]]

The Zambezi region was known to [[medieval]] geographers as the [[Empire of Monomotapa]], and the course of the river, as well as the position of [[Lake Ngami|Lakes Ngami]] and [[Lake Nyasa|Nyasa]], were given broadly accurately in early maps. These were probably constructed from [[Arab]] information.

The first European to visit the upper Zambezi was [[David Livingstone]] in his exploration from [[Bechuanaland]] between 1851 and 1853. Two or three years later he descended the Zambezi to its mouth and in the course of this journey discovered the Victoria Falls. During 1858–60, accompanied by [[John Kirk (explorer)|John Kirk]], Livingstone ascended the river by the Kongone mouth as far as the Falls, and also traced the course of its tributary the Shire and reached Lake Malawi.

For the next 35 years very little exploration of the river took place, but in 1889 the Chinde channel north of the main mouths of the river was discovered. Two expeditions led by Major [[A. St Hill Gibbons]] in 1895 to 1896 and 1898 to 1900 continued the work of exploration begun by Livingstone in the upper basin and central course of the river. Portuguese explorer [[Serpa Pinto]] examined some of the western tributaries of the river and made measurements of the Victoria Falls in 1878.

==Wildlife==
The river supports large populations of many animals. [[Hippopotamus]]es are abundant along most of the calm stretches of the river, and many [[Crocodile]]s are also present. [[Monitor lizard]]s are found in many places. [[Bird]] life is abundant, with species including [[Heron]], [[Pelican]], [[Egret]] and [[African Fish Eagle]] present in large numbers. [[Riverine]] woodland also supports many large animals, such as [[African Buffalo|Buffalo]], [[Zebra]]s, [[Giraffe]]s and [[Elephant]]s. However, below Kariba and Cahora Bassa dams, the cessation of annual [[flood]]ing has seen the area of this habitat greatly reduced and a corresponding reduction in the populations of the large mammals.

The Zambezi also supports several hundred species of [[fish]], some of which are [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] to the river. Important species include [[Cichlid]]s which are fished heavily for food, as well as [[Catfish]], [[Tigerfish]], [[Zambezi Yellowfish|Yellowfish]] and other large species. The [[Bull Shark]] is sometimes known as the Zambezi Shark after the river but is found around the world. It normally inhabits [[coast]]al waters but has been found far inland in many large rivers including the Zambezi. It is an aggressive shark which has been responsible for several attacks on humans.

==Economy==
[[Image:ISS009-E-7622-_Zambezi_river_near_Mongu.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The river and its floodplain near Mongu in Zambia]]

The population of the Zambezi river valley is estimated to be about 32 million. About 80% of the population of the valley is dependent on [[agriculture]], and the upper river's [[flood plain]]s provide good agricultural land.

Communities by the river fish extensively from it, and many people travel from far afield to fish. Some Zambian towns on roads leading to the river levy unofficial 'fish taxes' on people taking Zambezi fish to other parts of the country. As well as fishing for food, [[game fishing]] is a significant activity on some parts of the river. Between [[Mongu]] and [[Livingstone, Zambia|Livingstone]], several [[safari]] lodges cater for [[tourist]]s who want to fish for exotic species, and many also catch fish to sell to [[aquaria]].

The river valley is rich in [[mineral]] deposits and [[fossil fuel]]s, and [[coal]] mining is important in places. The [[dam]]s along its length also provide employment for many people near them, in maintaining the [[hydroelectric]] power stations and the dams themselves. Several parts of the river are also very popular tourist destinations. Victoria Falls receives over 1.5 million visitors annually, while [[Mana Pools]] and [[Lake Kariba]] also draw substantial tourist numbers. hi

==Transportation==
[[Image:Victoria Falls Bridge over Zambesi.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Victoria Falls Bridge. 1975 photo.]]
The river is frequently interrupted by [[rapids]] and so has never been an important long-distance transport route. However, along short stretches, it is often more convenient to travel by [[canoe]] along the river rather than on the unimproved roads which are often in very poor condition due to being regularly submerged in flood waters, and many small villages along the banks of the river are only accessible by boat.

There are only five bridges across the river along its entire course, of which one is a footbridge only. However, at many locations [[pontoon]]s ferry people and vehicles across the river. [[Victoria Falls Bridge]] was the first to be built, and was completed in April 1905. It was initially intended as a link in [[Cecil Rhodes]]' scheme to build a [[Cape-Cairo railway|railway from Cape Town to Cairo]]. The bridge is 250 m (820 ft) across, with a main arch spanning 150 m (490 ft), and the top of the bridge is 125 m (410 ft) above the low-water level of the river. 

Later bridges were constructed at Chirundu in Zambia (1939, replaced in 2003), Tete in Mozambique (1960s) and Chinyingi in northern Zambia in the 1970s (footbridge only). 2004 saw the completion of a bridge crossing the river from [[Sesheke]] in Zambia with [[Katima Mulilo]] in [[Namibia]], completing the [[TransCaprivi Highway]] and connecting [[Lusaka]] in Zambia with [[Walvis Bay]] on the Namibian coast.

==Ecology==
[[Image:STS51B-51-14- Lake Cahora Bassa.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Lake Cahora Bassa in Mozambique, one of the river's major sources of hydroelectric energy]]

Sewage [[effluent]] is a major cause of water [[pollution]] around urban areas, as inadequate water treatment facilities in all the major cities of the region force them to release untreated sewage into the river. This has resulted in [[eutrophication]] of the river water and has facilitated the spread of diseases of poor [[hygiene]] such as [[cholera]], [[typhus]] and [[dysentery]].

The construction of two major dams regulating the flow of the river has had a major effect on wildlife and human populations in the lower Zambezi region. When the Cahora Bassa Dam was constructed in 1973, its managers allowed it to fill in a single flood season, going against recommendations to fill over at least two years. The drastic reduction in the flow of the river led to a 40% reduction in the coverage of [[mangrove]]s, greatly increased [[erosion]] of the coastal region and a 60% reduction in the catch of [[prawn]]s off the mouth due to the reduction in emplacement of [[silt]] and associate [[nutrient]]s. [[Wetland]] [[ecosystem]]s downstream of the dam shrank considerably.
