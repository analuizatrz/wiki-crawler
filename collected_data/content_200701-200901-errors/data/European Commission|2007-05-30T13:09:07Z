[[Image:Berlaymont-night.jpeg|thumb|300px|right|The [[Berlaymont]] in [[Brussels]], seat of the Commission.]]
The '''European Commission''' (formally the '''Commission of the European Communities''') is the [[executive (government)|executive]] body of the [[European Union]]. Alongside the [[European Parliament]] and the [[Council of the European Union]], it is one of the [[Institutions of the European Union|three main institutions]] governing the Union. 

Its secondary roles are to propose and implement legislation, and to act as 'guardian of the [[EU treaties|treaties]]' which provide the legal basis for the EU. The role of the European Commission has many parallels with the executive body of a national government, but also differences (see below for details). 

The Commission, established by Articles 211-219 EC, consists of 27 Commissioners, one from each member state of the EU supported by an administrative body of about 23,000 European civil servants divided into departments called [[Directorate-General]]. The term "the Commission" is generally used to refer both to the administrative body in its entirety, and to the team of Commissioners who lead it. 

Unlike the [[Council of the European Union]], the Commission is intended to be a body independent of member states. Commissioners are therefore not permitted to take instructions from the government of the country that appointed them, but are supposed to represent the interests of the citizens of the EU as a whole.

The Commission is headed by a [[President of the European Commission|President]] (currently [[José Manuel Durão Barroso]]). Its headquarters are located in [[Brussels]], in a building known as the [[Berlaymont building|Berlaymont]], and its internal [[working language]]s are [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]]. 

==Powers and responsibilities==
{{Politics of the European Union}}
The Commission may be the executive branch of the European Union, but its powers are more restricted than most national executives. It is responsible for the day-to-day running of the Union (in those policy areas conferred to it): it drafts legislation for, enforces regulations of, and provides [[Foreign relations of the European Union|external representation]] on behalf of, the Union. In those senses it can be described as the executive, or [[government]] of the Union and has been described as such. [[Belgian Prime Minister]] [[Guy Verhofstadt]] is one who desires such a name change<ref>Guy Verhofstadt's book; ''The United States of Europe'', 2006 Federal Trust</ref>.

However the Commission is not responsible for [[taxation]], [[policing]] and the [[armed forces]]. The powers the Union has in those areas are limited and controlled primarily on an [[intergovernmental]] basis by the [[European Council]]. Together the two bodies could be described as the [[executive branch]] of the Union.

The Commission is important in being a body neutral of member-states in advancing a common European agenda, rather than a national one. [[Secretary-General of the European Commission|Secretary-General]] [[Catherine Day (civil servant)|Ms. Day]] described the Commission as "the only organisation that is paid to think European".<ref>[http://www.euractiv.com/en/constitution/interview-european-commission-secretary-general-catherine-day/article-158149 Interview with European Commission Secretary-General Catherine Day ] euractiv.com 25/09/06</ref>

===Legislation===
The Commission differs from other institutions in the EU system on account of its '''power of initiative'''. This means that only the Commission has the authority to ''initiate'' legislation in the areas known as the "first pillar". This has been kept solely in the domain of the Commission in order to ensure co-ordination in the drafting of [[European law]]. 

However, the [[Council of the European Union]] and the [[European Parliament]] are both able to formally request that the Commission legislate on a particular topic. In the areas that fall within the "second pillar" ([[Common Foreign & Security Policy (EU)|foreign policy and defence]]) and "third pillar" ([[Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters|criminal law]]), the Commission shares the power of initiating legislation with the European Council. 

Under the, currently stalled, [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|Constitutional Treaty]] the EU citizens would also be able to request the Commission to legislate in an area via a petition carrying one million signatures.

===Enforcement===
The Commission is responsible for adopting technical measures to implement legislation adopted by the Council and, in most cases, the Parliament. This legislation is subject to the approval of committees made up of representatives of member states. This process is sometimes known by the jargon term of [[comitology]].

The [[European Commissioner for Competition|Competition Commissioner]] [[regulation|regulates]] [[competition]] in the Union, vetting all mergers with Community-wide effects and initiating proceedings against companies which violate [[European Community competition law|EU competition laws]].

The Commission also takes the role of '''guardian of the treaties''', which includes taking responsibility for initiating infringement proceedings at the [[European Court of Justice]] against member states and others who it considers to have breached the EU treaties and other [[European Directive|community law]]. 

===Foreign relations===
The Commission provides [[foreign relations of the European Union|external representation]] for the Union through its [[President of the European Commission|President]] and [[European Commissioner for External Relations|External Relations Commissioner]]. The latter position would be merged with the [[High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy|High Representative]] under the Constitution to be a [[Vice-President of the European Commission|Vice President]] in the Commission.

The Commission negotiates international [[trade]] agreements (in the [[World Trade Organization]]) and other international agreements on behalf of the EU. It closely cooperates in this with the [[Council of the European Union]]. The Presidents of the Commission and Council attend [[G8]] meetings.

===Decision-making procedure===
Individual commissioners take responsibility for advancing the work of European Commission in their areas of interest, but any key decisions are generally taken collectively by the Commission as a whole. To make this possible, there are regular meetings of all the Commissioners, which have two types of agenda items [http://ec.europa.eu/comm/atwork/collegemeetings/index_en.htm]:
*'''A-item''' is an item that is not controversial and can be passed without discussion
*'''B-item''' still needs discussion before being accepted

==Appointment and makeup of the Commission==
[[Image:European Commission President Barroso.jpg|left|thumb|160px|[[José Manuel Barroso]], the [[President of the European Commission|Commission President]]<br>(''[[Barroso Commission]]'')]]
===President===
{{main|President of the European Commission}} 
The Commission President is nominated by the [[European Council]] who is then officially elected by the [[European Parliament]]. The President is often a leading politician from a member-state. In selecting their nomination the European Council take into account the latest European Elections hence the recent swing to the centre-right has produced the current President, [[José Manuel Durão Barroso]] of the [[European People's Party]].

====Vice-President====
{{main|Vice-President of the European Commission}}
The President appoints a number of [[Vice-President]]s. There are currently 5, including a single "First" Vice-President. They have relatively little extra power through the position beyond their existing portfolio. The current First-Vice-President is [[Margot Wallström]].

===Commissioners===
[[Image:Barroso Commission Group 07.jpg||thumb|right|400px|The college of Commissioners under Barroso.]]
{{main|European Commissioner}}
The Commission is composed of a 26-member college of "[[European Commissioner|Commissioners]]" (excluding the President). Each one from, but not representing, a member state and holding a specific portfolio delegated from the President. The whole Commission have to be approved by, and can be thrown out by, the Parliament. Each holds a portfolio such as [[European Commissioner for Competition|Competition]] or [[European Commissioner for Enterprise & Industry|Enterprise & Industry]].

===Directorates-General===
{{main|Directorate-General}}
The Commission is divided into departments known as Directorates-General (DG) that can be likened to [[Ministry (government department)|government ministries]]. The DGs cover either internal policies (e.g. the [[Directorate-General for Information Society and Media]]), external policies (e.g. the [[Directorate-General for External Relations]]) or internal services (e.g. the [[Directorate-General for Translation (European Commission)|Directorate-General for Translation]]).  Each Directorate-General is supervised by a senior [[civil service|civil servant]] known as the [[Director-General]], who reports directly to the Commissioner or Commissioners responsible for that policy area. [http://publications.eu.int/code/en/en-390600.htm (Full list of DGs)] According to figures published by the Commission 22,744 persons were employed by the Commission as officials and temporary agents in January 2007. Additionally 8,515 "external staff" (Contractual agents (CA), detached national experts (NED), young experts (JED) etc.) were employed. [http://ec.europa.eu/civil_service/about/figures/index_en.htm (Overview of official staff figures)]

== History ==
[[Image:Delors Commission I.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Delors Commission]], considered the most successful commission<ref>[http://www.bmbrussels.be/box_bmnewcomm.php THE NEW COMMISSION - SOME INITIAL THOUGHTS] bmbrussels.be</ref>]]
The Commission originated in the High Authority of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], which was established in 1951 under the terms of the Treaty Establishing the European Coal and Steel Community. In 1958 two further bodies were established under the terms of the [[Treaty of Rome|Treaties of Rome]]. These were the Commission of the [[European Economic Community]] and the Commission of the [[European Atomic Energy Community]]. Finally, in 1967, these three bodies merged to form the Commission of the European Communities, established under the terms of the [[Merger Treaty]]. This is the body that continues to exist to this day though the [[Hallstein Commission]] (of the Economic Community) and is considered as the "direct ancestor" of the current commission.

Previously the larger states ([[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]] and the [[United Kingdom]]) were allocated an extra Commissioner however with [[Enlargement of the European Union|enlargement]] (post-[[Prodi Commission]]). The latest members, [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]], were allocated a Commissioner each according to Article 45 of the protocol to the [[Treaty of Accession 2005|Accession Treaty of Bulgaria and Romania]]:

{{cquote|
A national of each new Member State shall be appointed to the Commission as from the date of accession. The new Members of the Commission shall be appointed by the [[European Council|Council]], acting by qualified majority and by common accord with the [[President of the European Commission|President of the Commission]], after consulting the [[European Parliament]](...).<ref>[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2005/l_157/l_15720050621en00290045.pdf Treaty of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania], ''Official Journal L 157 of 21 June 2005''</ref>}}

Under the proposed [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]] the Commission size would have been reduced from [[2014]] with only two out of three member-states having the right to representation, with this representation being rotated equally between all states and a maximum of two Commissioners per state.

==Press==
[[Image:Berlaymont Press Room.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The Berlaymont press room]]
Communication with the press is handled by the [[Directorate-General Communication (European Commission)|Directorate-General Communication]]. The Commission's [[spokesperson]] is Johannes Laitenberger and his two deputy spokespersons are Leonor Ribeiro da Silva and Pia Ahrenkilde Hansen. They take the midday [[press]] briefings (aka, the "Midday Presser") which take place every weekday in the Commission's press room at the Berlaymont. 

At those briefings, journalists can ask can ask European Commission officials absolutely anything they want and legitimately expect to get an "on the record" answer on live TV. Such a situation is unique in the world. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6496813.stm The peculiar world of the European Union] news.bbc.co.uk</ref> There's a greater number of press corps in Brussels than [[Washington D.C.]] with media outlets in every Union member-state having a Brussels [[correspondent]]. <ref>All above figures from E!Sharp magazine, Jan-Feb 2007 issue: Article "A tale of two cities".</ref>

==Criticism of the Commission==
{{main|democratic deficit in the European Union}}

Many [[Euroscepticism|eurosceptic]]s argue that the European Commission, its appointment and powers exemplify the alleged [[democratic deficit in the European Union]]. The European Commission is led by Commissioners who are proposed by national governments and approved by the European Parliament, rather than being directly elected by citizens. Although the Commission has no legislative power, it is the only body empowered to draft legislative proposals and has some executive responsibilities. According to the Commission's detractors this concentrates an unacceptable level of power in what is an unelected institution. 

The alternative viewpoint on the Commission states that the policy areas in which it has power to initiate legislation are ill suited to an institution accountable to electoral pressures. In this respect the Commission has been compared with institutions such as independent [[Central Bank]]s which deal with technical areas of policy that are of little electoral salience. In addition some defenders of the Commission point out that legislation must be approved by the Council in all areas (the ministers of member states) and the European Parliament in some areas before it can be adopted, thus the amount of legislation which is adopted in any one country without the approval of its government is limited.<ref>{{cite journal |quotes= |last=Majone |first=Giandomenico |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |month= |title=Perils of Parliamentarization |journal=Governance |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=375 |id= |url= |accessdate= }}</ref>

Outside of this general debate there has been specific criticism of the Commission over certain proposals: for instance the [[Proposed directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions]] or the [[European Political Parties Directive]].
