'''John Canfield Spencer''' ([[January 8]], [[1788]] [[Hudson, New York|Hudson]], [[Columbia County, New York]] - [[May 18]], [[1855]] [[Albany, New York|Albany]], [[Albany County, New York]]) was an American lawyer, politician, judge and [[United States Cabinet]] secretary in the administration of [[President of the United States|President]] [[John Tyler]].

==Early life==
He was the son of Chief Justice [[Ambrose Spencer]]. He graduated from [[Union College]] in 1806, became secretary to [[List of Governors of New York|New York Governor]] [[Daniel D. Tompkins]] in 1807, studied law in [[Albany, New York]] and was [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admitted to the bar]] in 1809, commencing practice in [[Canandaigua (city), New York|Canandaigua, New York]]. He married Elizabeth Scott Smith in 1809 and became a master of [[Court of equity|chancery]] in 1811.

==State politics==
During the [[War of 1812]], Spencer served in the [[United States Army]] where he was appointed [[brigade]] [[Judge Advocate General's Corps, U.S. Army|judge advocate general]] for the northern frontier. He was [[postmaster]] of Canandaigua, New York in 1814, became assistant [[attorney general]] and [[district attorney]] for the five western [[List of counties in New York|counties]] of New York in 1815 and was elected a [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican]] to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1816, serving from 1817 to 1819. Instead of seeking renomination in 1818, Spencer was a candidate for the [[United States Senate]], but lost to [[Rufus King]]. He was a member of the committee that reported unfavorably on the affairs of the [[Second Bank of the United States]], was a member of the [[New York State Assembly|New York Assembly]] from 1820 to 1822, serving as [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly|Speaker]] in 1820. He was a member of the [[New York State Senate|New York Senate]] from 1824 to 1828.

In 1826, Spencer served as a [[special prosecutor]] to investigate the disappearance of [[William Morgan (anti-Mason)|William Morgan]] who was arrested, [[Kidnapping|kidnapped]] and murdered for exposing secrets kept by [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]], thus sparking the [[Anti-Masonic Party|Anti-Masonic movement]]. Spencer sided with the anti-Masons and was the author of a manuscript on [[Freemasonry#Ritual, symbolism, and morality|Masonic rituals]]. He was again a member of the New York Assembly from 1831 to 1833 and moved to [[Albany, New York]] in 1837. He edited the [[English language|English]] edition of [[Alexis de Tocqueville]]'s ''[[Democracy in America]]'' and served as [[Secretary of State of New York]] from 1839 to 1841.

==Federal government==
In 1841, [[President of the United States|President]] [[John Tyler]] appointed Spencer to be [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] in his administration. As War Secretary, he proposed a chain of posts extending from [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]] to the [[Columbia River]], urged that the government adhere to field commander arrangements by compensating the [[Creek people|Creek Indians]] who were removed from the area. In 1842, his nineteen-year-old son, [[Philip Spencer]], a [[midshipman]], was executed without [[court-martial]] along with two other sailors aboard the brig [[USS Somers (1842)|USS ''Somers'']] for allegedly attempting [[mutiny]]. 

In 1843, Spencer was appointed [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] after the resignation of [[Walter Forward]]. As Treasury Secretary, he was preoccupied with the [[Tariff in American history|tariff]] and believed that the deficit and other federal expenditures should be funded by duties on imports rather than by internal taxation, something he was forced to announce for the [[fiscal year]] in 1843. The expenditures of the treasury had exceeded its receipts and he advocated additional import duties on certain articles such as [[coffee]] and [[tea]]. He also continued to develop a plan, originally initiated by Forward, for a Board of [[Exchequer]] to keep and disburse public funds raised by duties. The Exchequer bill, which reflected the federal government's continuing interest in some form of independent treasury system, failed due to a political conflict in the [[United States Congress]].

President Tyler had nominated Spencer to be an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] in the [[United States Supreme Court]] twice, first in [[January]] of 1844 to fill [[Smith Thompson]]'s seat and again in [[June]] of the same year to fill [[Henry Baldwin (judge)|Henry Baldwin]]'s seat, but the Senate failed to confirm him both times. As one of few northerners in an administration dominated by southern interests, Spencer found it increasingly difficult to serve in his cabinet post and resigned as Treasury Secretary in [[May]] of 1844. He returned to Albany where he died on [[May 18]], [[1855]]. He was interned in [[Albany Rural Cemetery]] beside his wife, Elizabeth.
