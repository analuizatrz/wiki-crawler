{{Gibraltar in WWII}}
The '''[[military history of Gibraltar during World War II]]''' exemplifies [[Gibraltar]]'s position as a [[British Empire|British]] fortress since the early 18th century and as a vital factor in British military strategy, both as a foothold on the [[Europe|continent of Europe]], and as a bastion of [[Royal Navy|British sea power]].<ref>''The Rock'' by Warren Tute, publ. by ''Companion Book Club'',. 1958</ref> During [[World War II]], Gibraltar served a vital role in the [[Mediterranean Theatre of World War II|Mediterranean Theatre]], controlling virtually all naval traffic into and out of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] from the west.<ref>William G.F. Jackson, The Rock of the Gibraltarians. A History of Gibraltar, Grendon : Gibraltar Books (1987) 1998</ref>

In addition to its commanding position, Gibraltar provided a strongly-defended harbour from which ships could operate in both the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. [[Force H]], under the command of [[James Fownes Somerville|Vice-Admiral James Somerville]] was based in Gibraltar and had the task of maintaining naval superiority and providing a strong escort for convoys to and from the [[Siege of Malta (1940)|besieged island of Malta]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/73/a2683073.shtml|title=Gibraltar's role in WWII|publisher=WW2 People's War|accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref> During the course of the war, Gibraltar came under aerial bombardment from [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] aircraft and aircraft of the Italian Royal Air Force (''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'') based on [[Sardinia]]. Additionally, the fortress was the focus of underwater attacks by the Italian Royal Navy (''[[Regia Marina]]'') [[commando]] [[frogman]] unit (''[[Decima Flottiglia MAS]]'') and their [[human torpedo]]es.  This Italian unit was based on the interned Italian ship ''SS Olterra'' in the nearby Spanish harbour of [[Algeciras]].<ref name="bbc1"/>

Inside the [[Rock of Gibraltar]] itself, miles of tunnels were excavated from the limestone. Masses of rock were blasted out to build an "underground city".<ref name="bbc1">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/99/a2627499.shtml|title=What life was like on the Rock during the War Years|publisher=WW2 People's War|accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref> In huge man-made caverns, barracks, offices, and a fully equipped hospital were constructed, complete with an [[operating room|operating theatre]] and [[X-Ray|X-ray equipment]].<ref name="bbc1"/>

[[Operation Torch]], the Allied invasion of [[French North Africa]] in November 1942, was coordinated from the "[[Rock of Gibraltar|Rock]]".<ref name="optorch">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/99/a2627499.shtml|title=What life was like on the Rock during the War Years|publisher=WW2 People's War|accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref> General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], who was given command of the operation, set up his headquarters in Gibraltar during the planning phases of the operation.<ref name="optorch"/> Following the successful completion of the [[North African campaign]] and the surrender of Italy in 1943, Gibraltar's role shifted from a forward operating base to a rear-area supply position. The harbour continued to operate dry docks and supply depots for the [[convoy]] routes through the Mediterranean until [[Victory in Europe Day|V-E Day]] in 1945.

[[World War II]] dramatically changed the lives of Gibraltarians.<Ref name="c2"/> The decision to enforce mass [[evacuation]] in order to increase the strength of the [[Rock of Gibraltar|Rock]] with more [[military]] and [[navy|naval]] personnel meant that most Gibraltarians (some for up to ten years) had nowhere to call 'home'.<Ref name="c2"/> Only those civilians with essential jobs were allowed to stay but it gave the entire community a sense of being 'British' by sharing in the war effort.<Ref name="c2">Bond, pp. 97</ref>

In June 1940 about 13,500 evacuees were shipped to [[Casablanca]] in [[French Morocco]], but following the [[Capitulation (surrender)|capitulation]] of the French to the [[Nazi Germany|German]] armies in June 1940, the new Pro-German French Vichy Government found the presence of Gibraltarian evacuees in Casablanca an embarrassment and sought opportunities for their removal.<Ref name="c2"/> The opportunity soon arose when 15 British [[cargo ship|cargo vessels]] arrived under Commodore Crichton repatriating 15,000 French servicemen who had been rescued from [[Battle of Dunkirk|Dunkirk]].<Ref name="c2"/> Once their own rescued servicemen had disembarked, the ships were interned until they agreed to take away all the evacuees.<Ref name="c2"/> Although Crichton was unable to obtain permission to clean and restock his ships (and contrary to [[Admiralty|British Admiralty]] orders which forbade the taking on of evacuees) when he saw the mass of civilians pouring through the dockyards, he opened up his gangways for boarding.<Ref name="c2"/> However, when they arrived at Gibraltar, the [[Governor of Gibraltar|Governor]] would not allow them to land fearing that once the evacuees were back on the Rock, it would be virtually impossible to evacuate them a second time.<Ref name="c1">Bond, pp. 98</ref>  Crowds gathered in John Macintosh square in the centre of Gibraltar as the news broke, speeches were made and two [[Local government in the United Kingdom#Councils and councillors|City Councillors]] accompanied by the Acting President of the Exchange and Commercial Library went to see the Governor (Sir Clive Liddel) to ask that the evacuees be allowed to land.<Ref name="c6"/> After receiving instructions from [[London]], a landing was allowed as long as the evacuees returned when other ships arrived to take them away from the Rock, and by 13 July the re-evacuation back to Gibraltar had been completed.<Ref name="c6"/> 

British [[Conservative Party (UK)|conservative]] politician [[Oliver Stanley]] agreed to accept the evacuees in the United Kingdom, but he argued with Gibraltar over the number of people involved.<Ref name="c6"/> The Governor, he declared, had given the number of evacuees first as 13,000, then as 14,000 and finally as 16,000.<Ref name="c6">Garcia, pp. 15</ref> He asked for the situation to be clarified, stressing the shortage of accommodation in Britain and insisting that only 13,000 could be accepted, 2,000 of whom were to be sent to the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] Atlantic island of [[Madeira]].<Ref name="c6"/> The situation, replied General Liddel on 19 July, "is that this is a fortress liable to heave and immediate attack and there should be no civilians here whereas there are 22,000.<Ref name="c6"/> The 13,000 was the number sent to [[Morocco]], and more would have been sent had the situation there not altered."<Ref name="c6"/> In London the evacuees were placed in the hands of the [[Ministry of Health]], and many were housed in [[Kensington]] area.<Ref name="c6"/> Concern for them in Gibraltar mounted as the air raids against London intensified, coupled with the arrival of harrowing letters, describing the circumstances in which the evacuees were living.<ref>GGA, Evacuation 1940: General Mechanics of </ref>

In September rumours were already circulating among the evacuees, and in Gibraltar, that the possibility of re-evacuating the Gibraltarians once more was being mooted, this time the destination being [[Jamaica]], in the [[Caribbean|West Indies]].<ref name="Garcia, pp. 16">Garcia, pp. 16</ref> After much contention, it was decided to send a party directly from Gibraltar to the island, and 1,093 evacuees left for Jamaica direct, on 9 October, with more following later on.<ref name="Garcia, pp. 16"/> However petitions followed and the demands were met, partly for strategic reasons and the lack of available shipping.<ref name="Garcia, pp. 16"/> The situation at the end of 1940, therefore, was that approximately 2,000 evacuees were in Jamaica and a lesser number in Madeira, with the bulk of around 10,000 housed in the London area.<ref>Garcia, pp. 16–17</ref>

==Royal Air Force involvement: 1939–1941==
Construction of a solid surface runway began in late 1939 and in 1940 it was proposed to extend the existing runway to a length of 1,550&nbsp;yards (1,417&nbsp;m).<ref name="raf"/> The land reclamation commenced towards the end of 1941 along with the construction of an RAF camp at the "North Front", now [[RAF Gibraltar]].<ref name="raf"/> The RAF dispatched their next squadron to Gibraltar at this time and it was in September 1939 that war with Germany was declared and the strong possibility of [[U-boat|German submarine]]s concentrating in the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] and using Spanish port facilities, loomed large in Admiralty thinking.<ref name="raf"/> So at 09:00 ([[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the 9 September 1939, [[No. 202 Squadron RAF]] was ordered to Gibraltar, loaded to the gunwales with equipment.<ref name="raf"/>

On 25 September 1939,  ''No 200 (Coastal) Group'' was formed as a subordinate formation to HQ RAF Mediterranean in control of No 202 Sqn.<ref name="uolib1"/> The Group's function was the control of [[Royal Air Force]] units operating from Gibraltar.<ref name="uolib1"/>  In late 1940 the Group was transferred to [[RAF Coastal Command|Coastal Command]].<ref name="uolib1">{{cite web|url=http://www.rafweb.org/Grp07.htm|title=Air of Authority—A History of RAF Organisation|publisher=Royal Air Force Organisation|accessdate=2007-07-04}}</ref>  Later a combined [[headquarters|HQ]] was formed which commenced operations in early 1942.<ref name="raf">{{cite web|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafgibraltar/aboutus/hist.cfm|title=The History of RAF Gibraltar|publisher=Royal Air Force—Gibraltar|accessdate=2007-07-05}}</ref>

For the aerial attack on the harbour of Gibraltar forces are to be designated which will guarantee abundant success. For the subsequent operations against naval objectives and for support of the attack of the Rock mainly dive bombers units are to be transferred to Spain. Sufficient anti-aircraft artillery is to be allocated to the army units including its use against ground targets.<ref>{{cite book | last=Prior | first=Dorothy E. | coauthors= | year=2005 | month= | title=A short History of Loreto in Gibraltar  | publisher=DOMA | location=Gibraltar | isbn=0-9583016-0-3 | pages= }}</ref>

The Rock came through the war relatively unscathed but, given its strategic importance, [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] made plans to capture Gibraltar.<Ref name="c4">Bond pp. 100–102</ref> Codenamed "Felix", the plan which was signed by [[Adolf Hitler]] himself was formulated at the highest level of command.<Ref name="c4"/> With or without permission, Germany would take entry through Spain and attack Gibraltar driving the British out of the Western Mediterranean.<Ref name="c4"/> The [[Strait of Gibraltar|Strait]] would be effectively closed to the Allies once Gibraltar was in German hands, forcing Mediterranean-bound Allied shipping to steam all the way around Africa and enter the sea through the [[Suez Canal]].<Ref name="c4"/> The Rock was to be heavily dive bombed by planes leaving France but landing afterwards at Spanish air bases.<Ref name="c4"/> To deny a possible Spanish capture of the base, the German planners decided that the final attack to seize Gibraltar was to be made by German troops alone.<Ref name="c4"/> 

===German plans===
{{main|Mediterranean U-boat Campaign (World War II)}}
Diplomatic failure at the highest levels of government prevented the operation from occurring at the beginning of 1941 which had been drawn up in detail by the Wehrmacht in the summer and autumn of 1940.<Ref name="felix">{{cite web|url=http://stonebooks.com/history/felix.shtml|title=Operation Felix: Assault on Gibraltar|publisher=Bill Stone|accessdate=2007-08-16}}</ref>

General [[Ludwig Kübler]]'s XLIX Corps would conduct the actual attack on the Rock.<Ref name="felix"/> The assault forces would comprise the [[Infantry Regiment Großdeutschland]], the 98th Regiment of the [[1st Mountain Division (Germany)|1st Mountain Division]], 26 medium and heavy artillery battalions, three observation battalions, three engineer battalions, two smoke battalions, a detachment of 150 [[Brandenburgers]], and up to 150 radio-controlled midget tanks ("Goliaths") packed with high explosives.<Ref name="felix"/> 

As part of a combined-force operation, the German Air Force (''[[Luftwaffe]]'') would contribute [[Junkers Ju 88|Ju 88A]]s, Stukas, [[Messerschmitt]]s, three light AA battalions, and three heavy AA battalions.<Ref name="felix"/><Ref name="c4"/> The German Navy (''[[Kriegsmarine]]'') would cooperate by using [[U-boat]]s to interfere with British naval movement and emplacing coastal batteries to further discourage the Royal Navy.<Ref name="felix"/><Ref name="c4"/>

On 10 March 1941, with [[Operation Barbarossa]] looming, Felix was amended to ''Operation Felix-Heinrich'',<Ref name="c4"/> whereby German troops would be withdrawn from the USSR to capture Gibraltar. As a result of Spanish dictator [[Francisco Franco]]'s intransigence, the operation was postponed, modified, and ultimately abandoned.<Ref name="c4"/><Ref name="felix"/>

===Decima Flottiglia MAS===

Gibraltar was a very tempting target for the Italians, who saw it as a refuge for British warships and allied merchant shipping.<ref name="mas"/> The Italian frogmen originally used a Spanish villa located two miles (3 km) from Gibraltar owned by an Italian officer who had married a Spanish woman named Conchita Ramognino.<ref name="mas"/>

==Operation Tracer: 1941–1942==

''Operation Tracer'' was a top-secret British spying mission that was only to be implemented if Gibraltar was captured by the Axis Powers.<Ref name="c12">{{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1997 |month=October |title=Operation Tracer |journal=Gibraltar Magazine |volume= |issue= |pages= |id= |url= |accessdate= 2007-06-29 |quote= }}</ref> Six men were to be sealed in a cave and left with only enough supplies for a year. The volunteers —two doctors, three signalmen and their leader— would run an observation post with two {{convert|12|in|mm|sing=on}} by {{convert|6|in|mm|sing=on}} slits, one looking due east out over the Mediterranean and the other west over the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] and the harbour. The team would then wireless back all shipping movements to the [[Admiralty|British Admiralty]].<Ref name="c12"/> 

They were told there would be no way out and anyone who died within the chamber would have to be embalmed and cemented into the walls. Only if Germany was defeated within their first year would they be released.<Ref name="c12"/> 

As the threat of invasion was clearly felt in late 1941, an idea for a series of secret observation posts (first in Gibraltar and later in other places like [[Malta]] and [[Aden]]) was put together under ''Operation Tracer''.<Ref name="c12"/> 

Work in Gibraltar began immediately under Commander Geoffry Birley and his chief engineer Colonel Fordham. The site chosen at Lord Airey’s Battery on the southern tip of the Rock already had an existing tunnelling scheme for a shelter.<Ref name="c12"/> 
Extensive trials of the equipment began in January 1942 under the eye of [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] radio expert Colonel Gambier-Parry. Much thought was also given to the type of men needed for such a strange and demanding task.<Ref name="c12"/> A member of [[Robert Falcon Scott|Scott]]’s ill-fated [[Terra Nova Expedition|expedition to the Antarctic]], Murray Levick was called up as Surgeon-Commander to advise on survival techniques.<Ref name="c12"/> There were practical matters such as diet, exercise, sanitation and clothing to consider as well as vital ‘psychology of the personnel’.<Ref name="c12"/> The full team was in place by the end of summer 1942 and their cavern fully equipped and ready for occupation.<Ref name="c12"/> A comprehensive manual was prepared on all aspects of the operation and it was considered that similar secret lookout posts should be prepared throughout the world in the event of future wars. However, Operation Tracer was never needed, as [[Adolf Hitler]] turned his attention away from Gibraltar and towards the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].<Ref name="c12"/> 

The operation had been clouded in mystery until the discovery of papers at the [[Public Records Office]] in [[Kew]] UK.<Ref name="c12"/> Previously in the 1960s, details of the story were told to a journalist by his intelligence service contacts and he wrote these up as ‘Operation Monkey,’ yet facts were very sparse.<Ref name="c12"/> 

In 1997 'Stay Behind Cave' (as it was nicknamed) was discovered in Gibraltar by the ''Gibraltar Caving Group'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gib.gi/museum/HMag%20V1%20I1%20P2.htm|title=STAY BEHIND CAVE – The Unique Finding of a Forgotten Story |journal=Gibraltar Heritage |publisher=Gibraltar Government Heritage Division | year=2002 | volume=1 | number=1 | accessdate=2008-11-07}}</ref> but no account was ever obtained from anyone associated with the mission.<Ref name="c12"/> The discovery came about when the group encountered a strong gust of wind in a tunnel. Further searching led them to break through a wall into chambers which had never been used and had remained sealed for over 50 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discovergibraltar.com/mainlogo/mainfrm.htm|title=Operation Tracer—Stay Behind Cave|publisher=discoverGibraltar.com|accessdate=2007-07-05}}</ref> 

In November 2006 Jim Crone and Sergeant Major Pete Jackson, senior tunnel guide with the [[Royal Gibraltar Regiment]], met possibly the only member of Operation Tracer still alive when they travelled to meet Dr. W. A. Bruce Cooper at his home in England.<Ref name="c12"/> Cooper, 92 at the time, provided an opportunity to shed light on the operation with his direct involvement in the mission as a [[Lieutenant|Surgeon-Lieutenant]] in the [[Royal Naval Reserve|Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve]] (RNVR).<Ref name="c12"/> He recalled stories about his colleagues, his training, and his feelings about the task.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/article2456304.ece|title=Ulsterman unravels mystery history of wartime Gibraltar cave operation|publisher=The Belfast Telegraph|accessdate=2007-07-03}}</ref>

Plans for the Allied counter offensive after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] were ongoing by mid-1942.<Ref name="c10"/> An invasion of Europe in 1943 would be unworkable, but the allies could attack the "soft underbelly of Europe" through the [[Mediterranean]], as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] put it.<Ref name="c10"/> Devised by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] and Churchill and code named [[Operation Torch]], the plan was to occupy French North Africa wherefrom attacks could be sent off to drive Italy out of the war.<Ref name="c10">{{cite web|url=http://www.gibraltar.gov.gi/latest_news/topical_speeches/operation_torch.htm|title=Address by the Hon P.R.

In July 1942 Lieutenant General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]{{ref label|pres|I|}} was appointed Allied Commander-in-Chief of Operation Torch.<Ref name="c10"/> Churchill placed Gibraltar under the command of General Eisenhower as the temporary headquarters for this, the first large-scale Anglo-American operation of the war.<Ref name="c10"/> He arrived in Gibraltar on 5 November 1942 to take over, not just command of Operation Torch itself, but also military command of Gibraltar.<Ref name="c10"/>

General Eisenhower stayed at ''[[The Convent (Gibraltar)|The Convent]]'', the official [[Governor of Gibraltar|Governor]]'s residence, but his operational headquarters were in a small chamber in a tunnel in the heart of the Rock.<Ref name="c10"/> In his memoirs General Eisenhower wrote: 

{{quote|The subterranean passages under the Rock provided the sole available office space, and in them was located the signal equipment by which we expected to keep in touch with the commanders of the three assault forces. The eternal darkness of the tunnels was here and there partially pierced by feeble electric bulbs. Damp, cold air in block-long passages was heavy with stagnation and did not noticeably respond to the clattering efforts of electric fans. Through the arched ceilings came a constant drip, drip, drip of surface water that faithfully but drearily ticked off the seconds of the interminable, almost unendurable, wait which always occurs between completion of a military plan and the moment action begins.<Ref name="c10"/>}}

One hundred thousand soldiers on the high seas in a multitude of transports converged on Gibraltar.<Ref name="c10"/> More than 400 aircraft of all types were crammed into the dispersal areas around the Gibraltar runway.<Ref name="c3"/> Fighters had been shipped in crates and assembled on the airfield.<Ref name="c2"/> Every available area of storage was taken up with [[ammunition]], fuel, and other essential supplies. 168 American pilots were housed in the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] messes at ''North Front''.<Ref name="c10"/>

On 8 November 1942, 466 aircraft from Gibraltar landed on captured North African airfields.

From their headquarters in Gibraltar, General Eisenhower and Admiral Sir [[Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope|Andrew Browne Cunningham]]{{ref label|cunni|III|}} directed Operation Torch, the first major combined combat operation during World War II involving American and British forces.<Ref name="c10"/>

===War tunnels===
Given that Gibraltar was a small town with only a few defences protecting it, the solution was to build a massive series of tunnels and chambers inside the natural protection of the [[Rock of Gibraltar]].<Ref name="gov"/> This "town" inside the Rock contained its own power station, water supply, and hospital.<Ref name="gov">{{cite web|url=http://www.gibraltar.gov.gi/tourism/great_siege.htm|title=The Great Siege Tunnels|publisher=Government of Gibraltar|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref> Some soldiers posted here would not see the light of day for months on end.

On 4 July 1943, a [[B-24 Liberator|Liberator bomber]] from [[RAF Transport Command]] took off from Gibraltar for England.<ref name="bloo"/> On board was General [[Władysław Sikorski]], Prime Minister of Poland's London-based government in exile and [[Commander-in-Chief]] of its armed forces, returning from visiting Polish troops in the Middle East.<ref name="bloo"/> 

The aircraft climbed normally from the runway, levelled off to gather speed but then suddenly lost height and crashed into the harbour.<ref name="bloo"/> The 62-year-old general died, along with 15 others.<ref name="bloo"/> The sole survivor was the Czech-born pilot, Max Prchal, who was rescued by an RAF launch.<ref name="bloo"/> The bodies of five passengers and crew, including Sikorski's daughter, were never found.<ref name="bloo">{{cite web|url=http://www.fpp.co.uk/History/Sikorski/Times040703.html|title=Real History and the Death of General Sikorski|publisher=The Times|accessdate=2007-06-30}}</ref>

===Investigation===
[[Image:Sikorski in Gibraltar.jpg|thumb|right|Sikorski atop the Rock of Gibraltar, surveying the fortifications.]]
In 1943 a British Court of Inquiry investigated the crash of Sikorski's [[B-24 Liberator|Liberator II]] ''AL523'', but was unable to determine the probable cause, finding only that it was an accident<ref>Stanczyk, Zbigniew L., [http://www.dziennik.com/www/dziennik/kult/archiwum/07-12-02/pp-09-13-02.html "Tajemnica gen. Sikorskiego"], ''Przegląd Polski Online", 7 December 2002, in Polish, retrieved 31 July 2007</ref> and the "aircraft became uncontrollable for reasons which cannot be established".

Official publication of the Polish government Agency of Combatants and Repressed</ref> Despite this finding, the political context of the event, coupled with a variety of curious circumstances, immediately gave rise to speculation that Sikorski's death had been no accident, and may in fact have been the direct result of a Soviet, British or even Polish conspiracy.<ref name="BBC'06">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5307448.stm|title='Polish soldier's 'fishy' sabotage tale'|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2007-06-30}}</ref>

Six weeks before the crash, while Sikorski had been at Gibraltar for the first time, en route to his Middle East inspection, a Polish government office in London received a phone call stating that Sikorski had been killed in a crash at Gibraltar; the call had been discounted as a prank, but has since led to speculation. It is often mentioned that two of Sikorski's previous planes had been subject to incidents. The 30 November 1942, forced landing at [[Montreal]], Canada, was suspected to have been caused by sabotage. Another incident might have taken place few months earlier, in March.<ref name="BBC'06"/> At Gibraltar, due to the special treatment accorded [[Very Important Person (person)|VIPs]], there was uncertainty about who had in fact boarded the plane and about the exact cargo manifest&mdash;all leading to uncertainty as to the identity of the bodies recovered from the crash site; some bodies, including that of Sikorski's daughter, Zofia, have never been recovered.<ref name="Wprost-Z">{{pl icon}} [http://www.wprost.pl/ar/?O=71300 Baliszewski, Dawid, "Bransoletka Zofii" ("Zofia's Bracelet"), ''Tygodnik Wprost'', no. 1152 (31 December 2004)], retrieved 31 July 2007.</ref>
