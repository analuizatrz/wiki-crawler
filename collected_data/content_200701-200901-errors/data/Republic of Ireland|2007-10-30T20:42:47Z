{{Portalpar|Ireland}}
'''Ireland''' ([[Irish language|Irish]]: ''[[Éire]]''; {{IPA|IPA [ˈeːrʲə]}}) is a country in north-western Europe. The modern [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] [[state]] occupies five-sixths of the island of [[Ireland]], which was [[Partition of Ireland|partitioned]] in 1921. It is bordered by [[Northern Ireland]] (part of the [[United Kingdom]]) to the north, by the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the west and by the [[Irish Sea]] to the east. The term '''Republic of Ireland''' ([[Irish language|Irish]]: ''Poblacht na hÉireann'') is officially used as "the description of the State".<ref>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/ZZA22Y1948S2.html Section 2] of the [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948]] (Irl).</ref>

==Name==
{{main|Names of the Irish state}}

''Bunreacht na hÉireann'' (Irish), the [[constitution of Ireland]], provides that "the name of the state is Éire, or, in the [[English language]], 'Ireland'." The [[state]] is also described as the "Republic of Ireland", in order to distinguish it from the island of Ireland and from [[Northern Ireland]]. The [[Republic of Ireland Act]] defined ''Republic of Ireland'' as the description of the state in 1949 (the purpose of the act being to declare that the state was a [[republic]] rather than a form of [[constitutional monarchy]]). However, because this was a statutory provision, the constitutional name of "Ireland" remains the official ''name'' of the state, whilst "Republic of Ireland" is a ''description'' of the state. The form ''Ireland'' is used for official purposes in [[English language]] documents such as treaties, government and legal documents, and membership of international organisations:, the form ''Éire'' is used when these are [[Irish language]] documents. However with [[Irish language|Irish]] being named the [[European Union]]'s twenty-third official language in 2007, the state will be referred to in both constitutional official languages, the Irish and English languages, similarly to other countries such as Finland and Belgium using more than one language at EU level.  This means the label 'Éire-Ireland' will be used on various signage and nameplates referring to the state.<ref>[http://www.irishexaminer.com/breaking/story.asp?j=187261558&p=y87z6zzEU&n=187262318 EU to call country 'Éire Ireland'], [http://www.irishexaminer.com/ Irish Examiner], [[27 June]] [[2006]].</ref> 
The state is also known by other names in English, such as {{lang|ga|''[[Éire]]''}}, [[Irish Free State|''The Free State'']] and the ''Twenty-six Counties''. Occasionally in the United Kingdom the state is referred to colloquially as [[Southern Ireland]], this term was only used officially for a brief period in Irish history: Irish people generally understand the phrase "southern Ireland" to mean [[Munster]]. Northern Irish people sometimes refer to the state as "The South" - it is not uncommon to hear Northern Irish people talking about going "down south".

The state has had more than one official title. The all-island revolutionary state, declared in 1919 by the large majority of Irish [[Member of Parliament#United Kingdom|Members of (the United Kingdom) Parliament]] elected in 1918, was known as the "[[Irish Republic]]"; when the present smaller state achieved {{lang|la|''de jure''}} independence in 1922, it became known as the "[[Irish Free State]]" (in the [[Irish language]] {{lang|ga|''Saorstát Éireann''}}), a name that was retained until 1937.

==History==
{{main|History of the Republic of Ireland|History of Ireland}}

The state known today as Ireland came into being when 26 of the counties of [[Ireland]] seceded from the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] (UK) in 1922. The remaining six counties remained within the UK as [[Northern Ireland]]. This action, known as the [[Partition of Ireland]], came about because of complex constitutional developments in the early twentieth century. 

It was preceded by the [[Easter Rising]] of 1916, when Irish volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army took over sites in Dublin and Galway under terms expressed in the [[Proclamation of the Irish Republic]]. The seven signatories of this proclamation, [[Patrick Pearse]], [[Thomas MacDonagh]], [[Thomas Clarke]], [[Sean MacDiarmada]], [[Joseph Plunkett]], [[Eamonn Ceannt]] and [[James Connolly]], were executed, along with nine others, and thousands were interned precipitating the [[Irish War of Independence]].

From [[1 January]] [[1801]] until [[6 December]] [[1922]], Ireland had been part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. During the [[Irish Potato Famine|Great Famine]] from 1845 to 1849 the island's population of over 8 million fell by 30 percent. One million Irish died of starvation and another 1.5 million emigrated,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mokyr|first = Joel|authorlink = Joel Mokyr|title = New Developments in Irish Population History 1700-1850|journal = Irish Economic and Social History|volume = xi|pages = 101-121|date = 1984}}</ref> which set the pattern of emigration for the century to come and would result in a constant decline up to the 1960s. From 1874, but particularly from 1880 under [[Charles Stewart Parnell]], the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] moved to prominence with its attempts to achieve [[Devolution#Irish home rule|Home Rule]], which would have given all of Ireland some autonomy without requiring it to leave the United Kingdom. It seemed possible in 1911 when the [[House of Lords]] lost their veto, and [[John Redmond]] secured the Third [[Home Rule Act 1914]]. The [[Unionists (Ireland)|unionist]] movement, however, had been growing since 1886 among Irish [[Protestant]]s, fearing that they would face discrimination and lose economic and social privileges if Irish [[Catholics]] were to achieve real political power. Though Irish unionism existed throughout the whole of Ireland, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century unionism was particularly strong in parts of [[Ulster Unionists|Ulster]], where industrialisation was more common in contrast to the more agrarian rest of the island. (Any tariff barriers would, it was feared, most heavily hit that region.) In addition, the Protestant population was more strongly located in Ulster, with unionist majorities existing in about four counties. Under the leadership of the [[Dublin]]-born [[Edward Carson|Sir Edward Carson]] and the northerner [[James Craig|Sir James Craig]] they became [[Ulster Defence Force|more militant]]. In 1914, to avoid rebellion in Ulster, the British [[Prime Minister]] [[H. H. Asquith]], with agreement of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party#Home Rule succeeds|Irish Party]] leadership, inserted a clause into the bill providing for home rule for 26 of the 32 counties, with an as of yet undecided new set of measures to be introduced for the area temporarily excluded. Though it received the [[Royal Assent]], the Third [[Home Rule Act 1914]]'s implementation was suspended until after the [[World War I|Great War]]. (The war at that stage was expected to be ended by 1915, not the four years it did ultimately last.) For the prior reasons of ensuring the implementation of the Act at the end of the war  Redmond and his Irish [[National Volunteers]] supported the Allied cause, and tens of thousands joined battalions of the [[10th (Irish) Division|10th]] and [[16th (Irish) Division]]s of the [[Kitchener's Army|New British Army]].

{{History of Ireland}}
In January 1919, after the December 1918 [[Irish (UK) general election, 1918|general elections]], 73 of Ireland's 106 [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] elected were [[Sinn Féin]] members who refused to take their seats in the [[British House of Commons]]. Instead, they set up an extra-legal Irish parliament called [[Dáil Éireann]]. [[First Dáil|This Dáil]] in January 1919 issued a [[Declaration of Independence|Unilateral Declaration of Independence]] and proclaimed an [[Irish Republic]]. The Declaration was mainly a restatement of the 1916 [[Proclamation of the Irish Republic|Proclamation]] with the additional provision that Ireland was no longer a part of the [[United Kingdom]]. Despite this, the new [[Irish Republic]] remained unrecognised internationally except by [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]'s [[Russian SFSR|Russian Republic]]. Nevertheless the Republic's [[Aireacht]] (ministry) sent a delegation under [[Ceann Comhairle]] [[Seán T. O'Kelly]] to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]], but it was not admitted. 

After the bitterly fought [[Irish War of Independence|War of Independence]], representatives of the [[Her Majesty's Government|British government]] and the Irish treaty delegates, led by [[Arthur Griffith]], [[Robert Barton]] and [[Michael Collins]] negotiated the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] in [[London]] from October 11th -6th December 1921.  The Irish delegates set up headquarters at [[Hans Place]] in [[Knightsbridge]] and it was here in private discussions that the decision was taken at 11.15am on 5th December to recommend the Treaty to Dáil Éireann.  Under the Treaty the British agreed to the establishment of an independent Irish State whereby the [[Irish Free State]] (in the [[Irish language]] ''Saorstát Éireann'') with [[Dominion|dominion status]] was created. The [[Dáil Éireann]] narrowly ratified the treaty.

The Treaty was not entirely satisfactory to either side. It gave more concessions to the Irish than the British had intended to give but did not go far enough to satisfy republican aspirations. The new Irish Free State was in theory to cover the entire island, subject to the proviso that six counties in the north-east, termed "Northern Ireland" (which had been created as a separate entity under the ''[[Government of Ireland Act 1920]]'') could opt out and choose to remain part of the United Kingdom, which they duly did. The remaining twenty-six counties became the [[Irish Free State]], a [[constitutional monarchy]] over which the British monarch reigned (from 1927 with the title [[monarchy in the Irish Free State|King of Ireland]]). It had a [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State|Governor-General]], a [[bicameral]] parliament, a cabinet called the "Executive Council" and a prime minister called the [[President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State|President of the Executive Council]].

The [[Irish Civil War]] was the direct consequence of the creation of the Irish Free State. Anti-Treaty forces, led by [[Éamon de Valera]], objected to the fact that acceptance of the Treaty ''abolished'' the [[Irish Republic]] of 1919 to which they had sworn loyalty, arguing in the face of public support for the settlement that the "people have no right to do wrong". They objected most to the fact that the state would remain part of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] and that [[Teachta Dála|Teachtaí Dála]] would have to swear an oath of fidelity to [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] and his successors. Pro-Treaty forces, led by [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], argued that the Treaty gave "not the ultimate freedom that all nations aspire to and develop, but the freedom to achieve it".

At the start of the war, the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) split into two opposing camps: a pro-treaty IRA and an [[Irish Republican Army (1922–1969)|anti-treaty IRA]]. The pro-Treaty IRA became part of the new [[Irish Army|National Army]]. However, through the lack of an effective command structure in the anti-Treaty IRA, and their defensive tactics throughout the war, [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Collins]] and his pro-treaty forces were able to build up an army capable of overwhelming the anti-Treatyists. British supplies of artillery, aircraft, machine-guns and ammunition boosted pro-treaty forces, and the threat of a return of Crown forces to the Free State removed any doubts about the necessity of enforcing the treaty. The lack of public support for the anti-treaty Irregulars, and the determination of the government to overcome them, contributed significantly to their defeat.

The National Army suffered 800 fatalities and perhaps as many as 4,000 people were killed altogether. As their forces retreated, the Irregulars showed a major talent for destruction and the economy of the Free State suffered a hard blow in the earliest days of its existence.
[[Image:Irishpopulation.png|400px|thumb|left|Republic of Ireland population during the twentieth century]]

On [[29 December]] [[1937]], a new constitution, the [[Constitution of Ireland]], came into force. It replaced the Irish Free State by a new state called simply "Ireland". Though this state's ''constitutional'' structures provided for a [[President of Ireland]] instead of a king, it was not technically a republic; the principal key role possessed by a head of state, that of symbolically representing the state internationally remained vested, in ''statute law'', in the King as an ''organ''. 

[[Irish neutrality during World War II|The Irish state remained neutral]] during [[World War II]], a period it described as [[The Emergency]]. 

On [[21 December]] [[1948]], the Republic of Ireland Act declared a republic, with the functions previously given to the Governor-General acting on the behalf of the King given instead to the President of Ireland.

The Irish state had remained a member of the then-[[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] after independence until the declaration of a republic on [[18 April]] [[1949]]. Under Commonwealth rules declaration of a republic automatically terminated membership of the association; since a reapplication for membership was not made, Ireland consequently ceased to be a member.

The Republic of Ireland joined the [[United Nations]] in 1955 and the [[European Community]] (now the [[European Union]]) in 1973. Irish governments have sought the peaceful reunification of Ireland and have usually cooperated with the [[British government]] in the violent conflict involving many [[Paramilitary|paramilitaries]] and the [[British Army]] in Northern Ireland known as "[[The Troubles]]". A peace settlement for Northern Ireland, the [[Belfast Agreement]], was approved in 1998 in referendums north and south of the border, and is currently being implemented.

==Politics==
{{main|Politics of the Republic of Ireland}}
[[Image:Mary McAleese.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[President of Ireland]], [[Mary McAleese]]]]

The state is a [[republic]], with a parliamentary system of government. The [[President of Ireland]], who serves as [[head of state]], is elected for a seven-year term and can be re-elected only once. The president is largely a [[figurehead]] but can still carry out certain [[constitution]]al powers and functions, aided by the [[Council of State]], an advisory body. The {{lang|ga|''[[Taoiseach]]''}} ([[prime minister]]), is appointed by the president on the nomination of parliament. The {{lang|ga|Taoiseach}} is normally the leader of the political party which wins the most seats in the national elections. It has become normal in the Republic for [[coalition]]s to form a government, and there has not been a single-party government since 1989.

The [[bicameral]] [[parliament]], the {{lang|ga|''[[Oireachtas]]''}}, consists of a Senate, {{lang|ga|[[Seanad Éireann]]}}, and a lower house, {{lang|ga|[[Dáil Éireann]]}}. The {{lang|ga|Seanad}} is composed of sixty members; eleven nominated by the {{lang|ga|Taoiseach}}, six elected by two universities, and 43 elected by public representatives from panels of candidates established on a vocational basis. The {{lang|ga|Dáil}} has 166 members, {{lang|ga|''[[Teachta Dála|Teachtaí Dála]]''}}, elected to represent multi-seat constituencies under the system of [[proportional representation]] by means of the [[Single Transferable Vote]]. Under the constitution, parliamentary elections must be held at least every seven years, though a lower limit may be set by statute law. The current statutory maximum term is every five years.

[[Image:Leinsterhouseirl.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Leinster House]], the seat of {{lang|ga|''[[Oireachtas Éireann]]''}} (the Irish parliament).]]
The Government is constitutionally limited to fifteen members. No more than two members of the Government can be selected from the Senate, and the {{lang|ga|Taoiseach}}, {{lang|ga|''[[Tánaiste]]''}} (deputy prime minister) and Minister for Finance ''must'' be members of the {{lang|ga|Dáil}}. The current government consists of a coalition of three parties; {{lang|ga|[[Fianna Fáil]]}} under {{lang|ga|Taoiseach}} [[Bertie Ahern]], the [[Green Party (Ireland)|Green Party]] under new leader [[John Gormley]] and the [[Progressive Democrats]] under [[Minister for Health and Children (Ireland)|Minister for Health and Children]] [[Mary Harney]]. The last scheduled [[Irish general election, 2007|general election]] to the [[Dáil]] took place on [[24 May]] [[2007]], after it was called by the Taoiseach on 29th April.

The main opposition in the current {{lang|ga|Dáil}} consists of [[Fine Gael]] under [[Enda Kenny]], [[Irish Labour Party|The Labour Party]] under new leader [[Eamon Gilmore]] and [[Sinn Féin]]. A number of independent deputies also sit in Dáil Éireann though less in number than before the recent election.

Ireland joined the [[European Union]] in 1973 but has chosen to remain outside the [[Schengen Treaty]]. Citizens of the UK can freely enter Ireland without a passport thanks to the [[Common Travel Area]], however some form of identification is required at airports and seaports.

==Counties==
{{main|Counties of Ireland}}
The Republic of Ireland traditionally had twenty-six [[County|counties]], and these are still used in cultural and sporting contexts. [[Dáil Éireann|Dáil]] constituencies are required by statute to follow county boundaries, as far as possible. Hence counties with greater populations have multiple constituencies (e.g. Limerick East/West) and some constituencies consist of more than one county (e.g. Sligo-North Leitrim), but by and large, the actual county boundaries are not crossed.

As local government units, however, some have been restructured, with the now-abolished [[County Dublin]] distributed among three new county councils in the 1990s and County Tipperary having been administratively two separate counties since the 1890s, giving a present-day total of twenty-nine administrative counties and five cities. The five cities &mdash; Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, and Waterford (Kilkenny is a city but does not possess a city council) &mdash; are administered separately from the remainder of their respective counties. Five boroughs &mdash; Clonmel, Drogheda, Kilkenny, Sligo and Wexford &mdash; have a level of autonomy within the county:

==Geography, climate, and environment== 
{{main|Geography of Ireland|Geography of the Republic of Ireland}}
[[Image:Topography Ireland.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Topography of Ireland]]
The island of Ireland extends over 84,421 [[Square kilometre]]s or 32,556 [[square mile]]s, of which 83% (approx. five-sixths) belong to the Republic (70,280 km²; 27,103&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) and the remainder constituting Northern Ireland. It is bound to the west by the [[Atlantic Ocean]], to the northeast by the [[North Channel (Great Britain)|North Channel]]. To the east is found the [[Irish Sea]] which reconnects to the ocean via the southwest with [[St George's Channel]] and the [[Celtic Sea]]. The west-coast of Ireland mostly consists of cliffs, hills and low mountains (the highest point being [[Carrauntoohil]] at 1,038 [[Metre|m]] or 3,406 [[Foot (unit of length)|ft]]). The interior of the country is relatively flat land, traversed by rivers such as the [[River Shannon]] and several large lakes or ''loughs''. The centre of the country is part of the River Shannon watershed, containing large areas of [[bogland]], used for [[peat]] extraction and production.

The local [[temperate climate]] is modified by the [[North Atlantic Current]] and is relatively mild. Summer temperatures exceed 30º[[Celsius|C]] (86°F) usually once every decade, though commonly reach 29°C (84º[[Fahrenheit|F]]) most summers, and freezes occur only occasionally in winter, with temperatures below -6°C (21°F) being uncommon. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] is very common, with some parts of the country getting up to 275 days with rain annually. 

Chief city conurbations are the capital [[Dublin]] 1,045,769 on the east coast, [[Cork (city)|Cork]] 190,384 in the south, [[Limerick City|Limerick]] 90,757 in the mid-west, [[Galway]] 72,729 on the west coast, and [[Waterford City|Waterford]] 49,213 on the south east coast (see [[Cities in Ireland]]).

====Impact of agriculture====
The long history of agricultural production coupled with modern intensive agricultural methods (such as pesticide and fertiliser use) has placed pressure on biodiversity in Ireland. Agriculture is the main factor determining current land use patterns in Ireland, leaving limited land to preserve natural habitats (also forestry and urban development to a lesser extent),<ref name="land_cover">{{Citation
  | title = Land cover and land use
  | publisher = Environmental Protection Agency
  | year = 2000
  | url=http://www.epa.ie/whatwedo/assessment/land/
  | accessdate = 2007-07-30}}</ref> in particular for larger wild mammals with greater territorial requirements. With no top predator in Ireland, populations of animals that cannot be controlled by smaller predators (such as the fox) are controlled by annual culling, i.e. semi-wild populations of deer. A land of green fields for crop cultivation and cattle rearing limits the space available for the establishment of native wild species. Hedgerows, however, traditionally used for maintaining and demarcating land boundaries, act as a refuge for native wild flora. Their ecosystems stretch across the countryside and act as a network of connections to preserve remnants of the ecosystem that once covered the island. 

Pollution from agricultural activities is one of the principal sources of environmental damage. "Runoff" of contaminants into streams, rivers and lakes impact the natural fresh-water ecosystems.<ref name="water_contamination">{{Citation

Forest covers about 10% of the country, with most designated for commercial production.<ref name="land_cover"/> Forested areas typically consist of monoculture plantations of non-native species which may result in habitats that are not suitable for supporting a broad range of native species of invertebrates. Remnants of native forest can be found scattered around the country, in particular in the [[Killarney National Park]]. Natural areas require fencing to prevent over-grazing by deer and sheep that roam over uncultivated areas. This is one of the main factors preventing the natural regeneration of forests across many regions of the country.<ref>{{Citation

==Education==
{{seealso|Education in the Republic of Ireland}}
The education systems are largely under the direction of the government via the [[Minister for Education and Science (Ireland)|Minister for Education and Science]] (currently [[Mary Hanafin]], TD). Recognised primary and secondary schools must adhere to the curriculum established by authorities that have power to set them.

The education systems in Ireland are complex due to a confusion of ownership, control and curricular assessment. This has arisen because the systems developed over long periods of time with variable influence by several key players, including the Irish state. Unlike in countries such as France, Ireland's state education system is largely limited to the content of the curriculum, although this too is mediated by voluntary interests. 

Primary, Secondary and Third (University/College) level education are all free in the Republic of Ireland for all [[EU]] citizens.

'''Ownership'''
Technically, the majority of Ireland's primary and secondary schools are owned by the Catholic parishes of the country. Parishes establish schools and this has tended to develop where the local Catholic Church provided the land under the ownership of a Board of Management, composed of various community interests, including but not exclusively so, the local Catholic priest. With the decline in numbers of priests, this has proven more and more problematic. The parish's school is then run by the Board of Management on behalf of the local community. With increasing numbers of non-Catholics in Ireland, the question of Catholic school ethos has become contested. The State provides and pays for the teachers, organises the curriculum and agrees to provide examinations and other centralised services for these schools. At second level, the system of ownership is more complex again because schools owned by the Churches, the State and other voluntary interests coexist side by side. At this level, the parish's interests are represented by a Board of Management / Trust established by an order of the Catholic Church under the direction of a Bishop. A state owned secondary school - generally called community or comprehensive schools - is wholly controlled by the State through the Department of Education and Science. A small number of other denominational schools exist such as those organised by the Islamic communities. The church ownership model extends to these groups too.

'''Control'''
Control of schools is technically vested in the Catholic Church/Church of Ireland/church grouping. As the State decides the content of educational curricula with various interests, including the Churches, control is effectively in the State's purview. Ireland's educational systems can be characterised in a largely voluntary manner. This does not imply that their effects are politically neutral with class and other interests sequentially embedded throughout each system.

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of the Republic of Ireland}}
[[Image:Ireland income distribution chart.gif|thumb|left|230px|Disposable income per person as a percentage of the national average.]] 
The economy of Ireland has transformed in recent years from an agricultural focus to one dependent on trade, industry and investment. Economic growth in Ireland averaged an exceptional 10% from 1995–2000, and 7% from 2001–2004. [[Industry]], which accounts for 46% of [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]], about 80% of exports, and 29% of the labour force, now takes the place of [[agriculture]] as the country's leading sector. 

Exports play a fundamental role in the state's robust growth, but the economy also benefits from the accompanying  rise in consumer spending, construction, and business investment. On paper, the country is the largest exporter of software-related goods and services in the world. In fact, a lot of foreign software, and sometimes music, is filtered through the country to avail of the state's non-taxing of royalties from copyrighted goods.

A key part of economic policy, since 1987, has been [[Social Partnership]] which is a [[corporatism|neo-corporatist]] set of voluntary 'pay pacts' between the Government, employers and trades unions. These usually set agreed pay rises for three-year periods.

The state joined in launching the [[Euro]] currency system in January 1999 (leaving behind the [[Irish pound]]) along with eleven other EU nations. The 1995 to 2000 period of high economic growth led many to call the country the [[Celtic Tiger]]. The economy felt the impact of the global economic slowdown in 2001, particularly in the high-tech export sector — the growth rate in that area was cut by nearly half. GDP growth continued to be relatively robust, with a rate of about 6% in 2001 and 2002. Growth for 2004 was over 4%, and for 2005 was 4.7%.

With high growth came high levels of inflation, particularly in the capital city. Prices in [[Dublin]], where nearly 30% of Ireland's population lives, are considerably higher than elsewhere in the country,<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.finfacts.com/Private/bestprice/irishconsumerprices.pdf Consumer Prices Bi-annual Average Price Analysis Dublin and Outside Dublin:  1 May 2006]|170&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 174411 bytes -->}} - CSO</ref> especially in the [[Irish Property Bubble|property market]].

Measuring Ireland's level of income per capita is a complicated issue. Ireland possesses the second highest [[GDP]] ([[Purchasing power parity|PPP]]) per capita in the world (US$43,600 as of 2006), behind [[Luxembourg]], and the fourth highest [[Human Development Index]], which is calculated partially on the basis of GDP per capita. However, many economists feel that GDP per capita is an inappropriate measure of national income for Ireland, as it neglects the fact that much income generated in Ireland belongs to multinational companies and eventually goes offshore. Another measure, Gross National Income per head, takes account of this and therefore many economists feel it is a superior measure of income in the country. In 2005, the [[World Bank]] measured Ireland's GNI per head at $41,140 - the seventh highest in the world, sixth highest in [[Western Europe]], and the third highest of any [[EU]] member state. Also, a study by ''The Economist'' found  Ireland to have the best [[quality of life]] in the world.<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.economist.com/media/pdf/QUALITY_OF_LIFE.pdf The Economist Intelligence Unit’s quality-of-life index]|67.1&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 68805 bytes -->}} - The Economist</ref> This study employed GDP per capita as a measure of income rather than GNI per capita. 

The positive reports and economic statistics mask several underlying imbalances. The construction sector, which is inherently cyclical in nature, now accounts for a significant component of Ireland's GDP. A recent downturn in residential property market sentiment has highlighted the over-exposure of the Irish economy to construction, which now presents a threat to economic growth.<ref name="oecd_survey">{{Citation

Several successive years of unbalanced economic growth have also led to huge inequality between the strata of Irish society (see [[Economy of the Republic of Ireland#Recent Developments|Economy of the Republic of Ireland - Recent developments]]). Poverty figures show that 6.8% of Ireland's population suffer "consistent poverty".<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.cso.ie/releasespublications/documents/labour_market/current/eusilc.pdf EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC)]|161&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 165354 bytes -->}} CSO, 2004.</ref>

==Military==
{{main|Irish Defence Forces}}

Ireland's armed forces are organised under the [[Irish Defence Forces]] ({{lang|ga|''[[Óglaigh na hÉireann]]''}}). The [[Irish Army]] is relatively small compared to other neighbouring armies in the region, but is well equipped, with 8,500 full-time military personnel (13,000 in the reserve army).<ref>[http://www.military.ie/army/intro.htm Irish Defence Forces, Army (accessed 15 June 2006)]</ref> This is principally due to Ireland's policy of [[neutral country|neutrality]],<ref> See Gilland, Karin.

There is also an [[Irish Air Corps]] and [[Reserve Defence Forces]] ([[Irish Army Reserve]] and [[Naval Service Reserve]]) under the Defence Forces. The [[Irish Army Rangers]] is a special forces branch which operates under the aegis of the army.

Over 40,000 Irish servicemen have served in UN peacekeeping missions around the world.

The Republic's air facilities were used by the U.S. military, for the delivery of military personnel involved in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] through [[Shannon Airport]]; previously the airport had been used for the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|invasion of Afghanistan]] in 2001. This is part of a longer history of use of Shannon for controversial military transport, which is largely unbiased towards any particular military alliance. The airport was used previously by the US in the [[First Gulf War]] and by the Soviet Union during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Kennedy | first = Michael | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Ireland's Role in Post-War Transatlantic Aviation and Its Implications for the Defence of the North Atlantic Area | publisher = Royal Irish Academy | date = 204-10-08 | url = http://www.histech.nl/Shot2004/programma/txt/kennedy.asp?file=kennedy | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2007-10-10 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Private Members' Business. - Foreign Conflicts: Motion (Resumed) | work = | publisher = Government of Ireland | date = 2003-01-30 | url = http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0560/D.0560.200301300005.html | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2007-10-10 }} - [[Tony Gregory]] speaking in [[Dáil Éireann]]</ref>

{{main|Demographics of the Republic of Ireland}}

Genetic research suggests that the first settlers of Ireland, and parts of North-Western Europe, came through migrations from [[Iberian peninsula|Iberia]] following the end of the most recent [[ice age]].<ref>[http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=7817 Myths of British ancestry] - Prospect Magazine</ref> After the Mesolithic, the Neolithic and Bronze Age migrants introduced Celtic culture and languages to Ireland.<ref>[http://www.breakingnews.ie/2004/09/09/story165780.html Geneticists find Celtic links to Spain and Portugal] - breakingnews.ie</ref> These later migrants from the Neolithic to Bronze Age still represent a minority of the genetic heritage of Irish people. ("Origins of the British", Stephen Oppenheimer, 2006)<ref>[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=15309688 The Longue Durée of Genetic Ancestry: Multiple Genetic Marker Systems and Celtic Origins on the Atlantic Facade of Europe] - PUBMED</ref> Culture spread throughout the island, and the [[Gaels|Gaelic]] tradition became the dominant form in Ireland. Today, Irish people are mainly of [[Gaels|Gaelic]] ancestry, and although some of the population is also of Norse, Anglo-Norman, English, Scottish, French and Welsh ancestry, these groups have been assimilated and do not form distinct [[minority group]]s. Gaelic culture and language forms an important part of national identity. In the UK, [[Irish Traveller]]s are a recognised ethnic [[minority group]], politically (but not ethnically) linked with mainland European Roma and Gypsy groups,<ref>[http://www.cre.gov.uk/gdpract/g_and_t_facts.html ''Commission for Racial Equality:'' Gypsies and Irish Travellers: The facts]</ref> although in the Republic of Ireland, the are not, instead they are classified as a "social group".<ref>[http://www.itmtrav.com/Legal-ResourcePack2.html ''Irish Travellers Movement:'' Traveller Legal Resource Pack 2 - Traveller Culture]</ref>

=== Languages ===
The official languages are [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[English language|English]]. Teaching of the Irish and English languages is compulsory in the primary and secondary level schools that receive money and recognition from the state. Some students may be exempt from the requirement to receive instruction in either language. English is by far the predominant language spoken throughout the country. People living in predominantly Irish-speaking communities, [[Gaeltacht]] regions, are limited to the low tens of thousands in isolated pockets largely on the western seaboard. Road signs are usually bilingual, except in Gaeltacht regions, where they are in Irish only. The legal status of place names has recently been the subject of controversy, with an order made in 2005 under the [[Official Languages Act 2003|Official Languages Act]] changing the official name of certain locations from English back to Irish (e.g. [[Dingle]] had its name changed to ''An Daingean'', but was then renamed to "Dingle Daingean Ui Chuis"), sometimes despite local opposition, and, in Dingle's case, a plebiscite requesting a name change to a bilingual version. Most public notices are only in [[English language|English]], as are most of the print media. Most Government publications and forms are available in both English and Irish, and citizens have the right to deal with the state in Irish if they so wish.  National media in Irish exist on TV ([[TG4]]), radio (e.g. [[Raidió na Gaeltachta]]), and in print (e.g. [[Lá Nua]] and [[Foinse]]).

According to the 2006 census, 1,656,790 people (or 39%) in the Republic regard themselves as competent in Irish; though no figures are available for English-speakers, it is thought to be almost 100%.

The [[Polish language]] is one of the most widely-spoken languages in Ireland after English and Irish: there are over 63,000 Poles resident in Ireland according to the 2006 census. Other languages spoken in Ireland include [[Shelta]], spoken by the [[Irish Traveller]] population and  a dialect of [[Ulster Scots language|Scots]] is spoken by the descendents of [[Ulster-Scots|Scottish settlers]] in [[Ulster]]. {{Unicode|}}

Most students at second level choose one or two foreign [[languages]] to learn. Languages available for the [[Junior Certificate]] and the [[Leaving Certificate]] include [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]; Leaving Certificate students can also study [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. Some schools also offer [[Ancient Greek]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew Studies]] and [[Latin]] at second level.

===Recent population growth===
Ireland's population has increased greatly in recent years.  Much of this population growth can be attributed to the arrival of immigrants and the return of Irish people (often with their foreign-born children) who emigrated in large numbers in earlier years during periods of high unemployment. However, birth rates in Ireland are currently over double the death rates, which is highly unusual among Western European countries, and the nation seems to be in the midst of a baby boom.<ref>[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/boom-in-births-as-new-arrivals-double-on-death-rates-1048773.html Irish Independent - Boom in births as new arrivals double on death rates]</ref> Approximately 10% of Ireland's population is now made up of foreign citizens.
[[Image:NonnationalsIreland2006.png|thumb|300px|left|Non-national groups with populations in Ireland of 10,000 or more in 2006. Non-European Union nationals are shown exploded.]]
The [[Central Statistics Office (Ireland)|CSO]] has published preliminary findings based on the 2006 Census of Population. These indicate:
* The total population of Ireland on Census Day, [[April 23]] [[2006]], was 4,234,925, an increase of 317,722, or 8.1% since 2002
*Allowing for the incidence of births (245,000) and deaths (114,000), the derived net immigration of people to Ireland between 2002 and 2006 was 186,000. 
*The total number of non-nationals (foreign citizens) resident in Ireland is 419,733, or around 10% (plus 1,318 people with 'no nationality' and 44,279 people whose nationality is not stated).
*The single largest group of immigrants comes from the [[United Kingdom]] (112,548) followed by [[Poland]] (63,267), [[Lithuania]] (24,628), [[Nigeria]] (16,300), [[Latvia]] (13,319), the [[United States]] (12,475), [[China]] (11,161), and [[Germany]] (10,289).
*94.8% of the population was recorded as having a 'White' ethnic or cultural background.  1.1% of the population had a 'Black or Black Irish' background, 1.3% had an 'Asian or Asian Irish' background and 1.7% of the population's ethnic or cultural background was 'not stated'.
*The average annual rate of increase, 2%, is the highest on record – compared to 1.3% between 1996 and 2002 and 1.5% between 1971 and 1979.
*The 2006 population was last exceeded in the 1861 Census when the population then was 4.4 million The lowest population of Ireland was recorded in the 1961 Census – 2.6 million.
*All provinces of Ireland recorded population growth. The population of [[Leinster]] grew by 8.9%; [[Munster]] by 6.5%; and the long-term population decline of the [[Connacht]]-[[Ulster]]<ref>Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan only.  Remaining Ulster counties are in Northern Ireland</ref> Region has stopped.
* The ratio of males to females has declined in each of the four provinces between 1979 and 2006. Leinster is the only province where the number of females exceeds the number of males. Males predominate in rural counties such as [[Cavan]], [[County Leitrim|Leitrim]], and [[Roscommon]] while there are more females in cities and urban areas.

A more detailed breakdown of these figures is available online. {{PDFlink|[http://www.cso.ie/census/documents/Final%20Principal%20Demographic%20Results%202006.pdf Census 2006 Principal Demographic Results]|894&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 916355 bytes -->}}

The Republic of Ireland is 86.8% [[Roman Catholic]],<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.cso.ie/census/documents/Final%20Principal%20Demographic%20Results%202006.pdf Final Principal Demographic Results 2006]|894&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 916355 bytes -->}}</ref> and has one of the highest rates of regular and weekly church attendance in the [[Western World]].<ref>[http://cara.georgetown.edu/bulletin/international.htm Weekly Mass Attendance of Catholics in Nations with Large Catholic Populations, 1980-2000] - World Values Survey (WVS)</ref> However, there has been a major decline in this attendance among [[Irish Catholic]]s in the course of the past 30 years. Between 1996 and 2001, regular [[Roman Catholic Mass|Mass]] attendance, declined further from 60% to 48%<ref>[http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=44521 Irish Mass attendance below 50%] - Catholic World News [[June 1]], [[2006]]</ref> (it had been above 90% before 1973), and all but two of its sacerdotal seminaries have closed (St Patrick's College, Maynooth and St Malachy's College, Belfast). A number of theological colleges continue to educate both ordained and lay people. 

The second largest Christian denomination, the [[Church of Ireland]] ([[Anglicanism|Anglican]]), having been declining in number for most of the twentieth century, but has more recently experienced an increase in membership, according to the 2002 census, as have other small Christian denominations, and [[Hinduism in Ireland|Hinduism]].  The largest other Protestant denominations are the [[Presbyterian Church in Ireland]], followed by the [[Methodist Church in Ireland]]. The very small [[Judaism|Jewish]] community in the state also recorded a marginal increase (see [[History of the Jews in Ireland]]) in the same period.

The patron saints of Ireland are [[Saint Patrick]] and [[Brigid of Kildare|Saint Bridget]].

According to the 2006 census, the number of people who described themselves as having "no religion" was 186,318 (4.4%). An additional 1,515 people described themselves as agnostic and 929 as atheist instead of ticking the "no religion" box. This brings the total nonreligious within the state to 4.5% of the population. A further 70,322 (1.7%) did not state a religion.<ref>[http://www.cso.ie/census/documents/Final%20Principal%20Demographic%20Results%202006.pdf Final Principal Demographic Results 2006]</ref>

===Religion and politics===
The [[1937]] [[Constitution of Ireland]] gave the [[Catholic Church]] a "special position" as the church of the majority, but also recognised other Christian denominations and Judaism.  As with other predominantly Catholic European states (e.g., [[Italy]]), the Irish state underwent a period of legal secularisation in the late [[20th century|twentieth century]].  In 1972, the articles mentioning specific religious groups, including the Catholic Church were deleted from the Irish constitution by the [[Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland]].

Article 44 remains in the Constitution. It begins:
:''The State acknowledges that the homage of public worship is due to Almighty God. It shall hold His Name in reverence, and shall respect and honour religion.''
The article also establishes freedom of religion (for belief, practice, and organisation without undue interference from the state), prohibits endowment of any particular religion, prohibits the state from religious discrimination, and requires the state to treat religious and non-religious schools in a non-prejudicial manner.

Catholic doctrine prohibits [[abortion]] in all circumstances, putting it in conflict with the [[pro-choice]] movement.  In 1983, the [[Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland]] recognised "the right to life of the unborn", subject to qualifications concerning the "equal right to life" of the mother.  The case of ''[[Attorney General v. X]]'' prompted passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Thirteenth]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Fourteenth]] Amendments, guaranteeing the right to travel abroad to have an abortion performed, and the right of citizens to learn about "services" that are illegal in Ireland but legal outside the country (see [[Abortion in Ireland]]).

Catholic and Protestant attitudes in 1937 also disapproved of divorce, which was prohibited by the original Constitution.  It was not until 1995 that the [[Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Fifteenth Amendment]] repealed this ban.

The [[Catholic Church]] was hit in the 1990s by a series of sexual abuse scandals and cover-up charges against its hierarchy. In 2005, a major inquiry was made into [[child sexual abuse]] allegations. The Ferns report, published on [[25 October]], [[2005]], revealed that more than 100 cases of child sexual abuse, between 1962 and 2002, by 21 priests, had taken place in the Diocese of Ferns alone. The report criticised the [[Garda Síochána|Gardaí]] and the health authorities, who failed to protect the children to the best of their abilities; and in the case of the Garda before 1988, no file was ever recorded on sexual abuse complaints (see [[Roman Catholic sex abuse cases]]).

Despite most schools in Ireland being run by religious organisations, a general trend of secularism is occurring within the Irish population, particularly in the younger generations. Many efforts have been made by secular groups, to eliminate the rigorous study of prayer in the first and sixth classes, to prepare for the sacraments of holy communion and confirmation. However religious studies as a subject was introduced into the state administered "Junior certificate" in 2001.

In the past, Ireland has historically favoured conservative legislation regarding sexuality. For example, contraception was illegal in Ireland until 1979.<ref name="familyplanning">{{cite web | title = Health (Family Planning) Act, 1979 | date = 1979-07-23 | publisher = Office of the Attorney General | url = http://193.178.1.79:80/1979/en/act/pub/0020/index.html | accessdate = 2007-06-07}}</ref> Another example is the legislation which outlawed homosexual acts was not repealed until 1993 although it was generally only enforced when dealing with underage sex.<ref name="norris">{{cite web | title = NORRIS v.

==Culture==
{{main|Culture of Ireland}}

The island of Ireland has produced the [[Book of Kells]], and writers such as [[George Berkeley]], [[Jonathan Swift]], [[James Joyce]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]], [[Oliver Goldsmith]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[William Butler Yeats|W.B. Yeats]], [[Patrick Kavanagh]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[John Millington Synge]], [[Seán O'Casey]], [[Seamus Heaney]], [[Bram Stoker]] and others. Shaw, Yeats, Beckett and Heaney are [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Literature]] laureates. Other prominent writers include [[John Banville]], [[Roddy Doyle]], [[Pádraic Ó Conaire]], [[Máirtín Ó Cadhain]], [[Séamus Ó Grianna]], [[Dermot Bolger]], [[Maeve Binchy]], [[Frank McCourt]], [[Edna O'Brien]], [[Joseph O'Connor]], [[John McGahern]] and [[Colm Tóibín]]. 

Prominent Irish artists include Nathaniel Hone, James Arthur O'Connor, Roderick O'Conor, Jack Yeats, William Orpen, Mainie Jellett, Louis le Brocquy, Anne Madden, Robert Ballagh, James Coleman, Dorothy Cross and John Gerrard.

Ireland is known for its [[Irish traditional music]], but has produced many other internationally influential artists in other musical genres, such as [[The Pogues]], the [[alternative rock]] group [[The Cranberries]], [[Blues]] [[guitar]]ist [[Rory Gallagher]], folk singer [[Christy Moore]], [[The Chieftans]] and singer [[Sinéad O'Connor]]. 

In [[European classical music|classical music]], the Island of Ireland was also the birthplace of the notable composers [[Turlough O'Carolan]], [[John Field (composer)|John Field]] (inventor of the [[Nocturne]]), [[Gerald Barry]], [[Michael William Balfe]], Sir [[Charles Villiers Stanford]] and [[Charles Wood (composer)|Charles Wood]].

[[Robert Boyle]] was a seventeenth-century physicist and discovered [[Boyle's Law]]. [[Ernest Walton]] of [[Trinity College Dublin]] shared the 1951 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for "splitting the atom". [[William Rowan Hamilton]] was a significant mathematician. The Irish philosopher and theologian [[Eriugena]], was considered one of the leading intellectuals of his era.

In the early twenty-first century, [[Damien Rice]] and [[The Thrills]] rose to international fame. [[The Frames]] are a popular band in Ireland who are on the rise world-wide, although their status as possibly the best-liked live band in Ireland is under threat from newer bands like [[Bell X1 (band)|Bell X1]].
[[Image:U22005.jpg|thumb|left|280px|[[U2]], the most successful Irish band of all time and one of the biggest bands internationally since the 1980s.]]

The flourishing Irish film industry, state-supported by [[Bord Scannán na hÉireann]], helped launched the careers of directors [[Neil Jordan]] and [[Jim Sheridan]], and supported Irish films such as [[John Crowley (director)|John Crowley's]] ''[[Intermission (film)|Intermission]]'', Neil Jordan's ''[[Breakfast on Pluto (film)|Breakfast on Pluto]]'', and others. A policy of tax breaks and other incentives has also attracted international film to Ireland, including [[Mel Gibson|Mel Gibson's]] ''[[Braveheart]]'', [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]''.

==Sport==
[[Image:Hurlingincrokepark.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Kilkenny GAA|Kilkenny]] V [[Wexford GAA|Wexford]] in [[Croke Park]] ]]
The national sports, administered by the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]], are [[Gaelic football]] and [[hurling]], arguably the world's fastest field team sport in terms of game play.  

Ireland has produced a number of talented sportsmen and women. In football (soccer), former players include [[Roy Keane]], [[Johnny Giles]], [[Liam Brady]], [[Denis Irwin]], [[Packie Bonner]], [[Niall Quinn]] and [[Paul McGrath (footballer)|Paul McGrath]], while footballers whose careers are ongoing include [[Lee Carsley]], [[Steve Finnan]], [[Shay Given]], [[Damien Duff]], and [[Robbie Keane]]. In rugby, Ireland has produced [[Ronan O'Gara]], [[Brian O'Driscoll]], [[Paul O'Connell]], [[David Wallace]] and [[Keith Wood]]. 

In athletics, [[Sonia O'Sullivan]], [[Eamonn Coghlan]], [[Catherina McKiernan]], [[Ronnie Delaney]], [[John Treacy]], [[David Gillick]], and [[Derval O'Rourke]] have won medals at international events. Notable Gaelic Athletic Association players include the now retired pair of [[DJ Carey]] and [[Peter Canavan]]. 

[[Ken Doherty]] is a former World Champion [[snooker]] player. [[John L. Sullivan]], born 1858 in the United States to Irish immigrant parents, was the first modern world heavyweight champion. [[Barry McGuigan]] and [[Steve Collins]] were also world champion boxers, while [[Bernard Dunne]] was a European champion and [[Michael Carruth]] an Olympic gold medallist.

In motorsport, during the 1990s [[Jordan Grand Prix]] became the only independent team to win multiple [[Formula One]] races.

In cycling, Ireland produced [[Stephen Roche]], the first and only Irishman to win the Tour de France in 1987, and the prolific [[Seán Kelly (cyclist)|Seán Kelly]].

In [[golf]], the current [[The Open Championship|British Open]] champion is Irishman [[Pádraig Harrington]].

Professional wrestler, [[Fergal Devitt|Prince Devitt]], was born in Dublin, and has made a large impact in the last few years on the independent circuit in Europe, Japan, and the United States.

==Transport==
{{Seealso|Transport in Ireland|Rail transport in Ireland|Roads in Ireland}}
The Republic of Ireland has three main [[international airports]] ([[Dublin Airport|Dublin]], [[Shannon Airport|Shannon]], and [[Cork Airport|Cork]]) that serve a wide variety of European and intercontinental routes with scheduled and [[chartered flights]]. The national airline is [[Aer Lingus]], although low cost airline [[Ryanair]] is the largest airline. The route between [[London]] and [[Dublin]] is the busiest international air route in Europe, with 4.5 million people flying between the two cities in 2006.<ref>Seán McCárthaigh, [http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/2003/03/31/story437213650.asp Dublin–London busiest air traffic route within EU], ''Irish Examiner'', [[March 31]], [[2003]]</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Heathrow dominates top 20 | author = Mark Frary | url = http://travel.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/travel/business/article1538856.ece | publisher = ''[[The Times]]'' | date = [[19 March]] [[2007]] | accessdate = 2007-07-04}}</ref>

Railways services are provided by [[Iarnród Éireann]]. Dublin is the centre of the network, with two main stations ([[Dublin Heuston railway station|Heuston]] and [[Dublin Connolly railway station|Connolly]]) linking to the main towns and cities. The [[Enterprise (train)|Enterprise]] service, run jointly with [[Northern Ireland Railways]] connects Dublin with Belfast. 

The [[motorway]]s and major [[trunk roads]] are managed by the [[National Roads Authority]]. The rest of the road network is managed by the local authorities in each of their areas. 

Regular [[ferry]] services operate between the Republic of Ireland and [[Great Britain]], the [[Isle of Man]] and [[France]].

===Light rail===
On independence the cities of Dublin and Cork both had extensive light rail networks, as did many parts of the country-side, for example the West-Clare and West-Kerry railways. Cork's light rail network was removed from service in 1931 after the transfer of authority for them from the Cork city electricity company to the Irish Omnibus Company. Trams in Dublin were phased out between 1940 and '44. Following closure, tram lines were dug up, and equipment and facilities sold-off. Tram service in Ireland was not operated again in Ireland until 2004, when the first two lines of a new light-rail system known as [[Luas]], the [[Irish language|Irish]] word for ''speed'', were opened in Dublin. It features on-street running in the city centre, but is considered a light-rail system because it runs along a dedicated right-of-way for much of its route. There are seven more [[Transport 21|Luas projects planned]], all of which are to be complete by 2015. Two [[Dublin Metro|light-metro]] lines are also to be built by 2014 as well; which is a similar idea to light rail, though will be fully segregated from traffic.

Plans also exist for light-rail systems in the cities of [[Cork (city)|Cork]] and [[Galway]] (see [[Corrib Light Rail]]), both of which have strong support from the city councils and city residents alike. In January 2007, the [[Green Party (Ireland)|Green Party]] promised that, if it formed part of the next [[Government of Ireland|government]] in 2007, they would have light rail systems built in these cities.<ref>[http://www.greenparty.ie/en/news/latest_news/green_party_commits_to_new_light_rail_projects_in_cork_galway_and_dublin Green Party commits to new light rail projects in Cork, Galway and Dublin] - green party website</ref> In addition, there is also a smaller campaign for a light-rail system in [[Limerick]].<ref>[http://www.limerickblogger.org/blog/?p=2301 The Limerick Blogger Election Project: Trish Forde-Brennan (Green, E)]</ref>
