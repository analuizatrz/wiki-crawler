'''Kabbalistic astrology''' or Mazal, Mazalot (zodiac, destiny) is [[astrology]] based upon the Hebrew [[Kabbalah]] to interpret and delineate a person's [[Natal chart|birth chart]]. In Hebrew, astrology was called ''hokmat ha-nissayon'', "the wisdom of prognostication", in distinction to ''hokmat ha-hizzayon'' (wisdom of star-seeing, or [[astronomy]]). Although kabbalah is part of Jewish tradition, its use of astrology does not represent the complete [[Jewish views of astrology]] ,which have been both positive and negative, depending on the authority. 

The inner structure of the soul is reflected in the Kabbalah [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]]. A trestleboard is used to chart the placements of the various planets and signs of the [[zodiac]]. 

Mazal is a one part of whole body of 4 types of Kabbalah knowledge (creation, functioning, ruling, reincarnation).

It is said, that some righteous tsaddikim had a knowledge, perception and direct feeling of Mazal. They were able to say what exact time of the day is now, even being long time in closed buildings.
This was attributed to their perfect understanding of Mazal. 

It is known, that in certain moment of time some certain spiritual power is active and one who has a sensitive feelings is able to determine what kind of power is active this time, so he can directly perceive time of the day without seeing position of the Sun or without having a clock.

According to Judaism if person has a lot of children so he gets bigger and more happier Mazal.

Most [[astrologer]]s cast and use a [[horoscope]], which is translated as ‘a view of time’ to depict planetary placements which serve to influence our daily activities. For example, the [[square horoscope]] was used extensively until the [[Middle Ages]] when it was replaced by the circular version which was more clearly representative of the orbital paths of the celestial bodies that were observed. Cabalistic astrologers tend to take a slightly different approach because they wish to observe the [[planet]]s as they relate to each sephira in the Tree of Life. Therefore, the [[Sun sign|sign]] and house placement is written on the associated node of the trestleboard. 

Each sephira points to a specific character trait which helps us to identify exactly where we are in our evolutionary path to enlightenment. Each sephira in the testleboard corresponds with a specific planet and is therefore closely aligned with the celestial art of astrology. The meanings of the ten sephiroth, to include the eleventh imaginary one, are as follows:- 

==Malkhuth==
[[Malkhuth (Kabbalah)|Malkhuth]] is position 10 of the Tree of Life and is associated with the keyword Kingdom. It represents our roots, home, family and close relationships. The essence of this sephira is the physical world and shows that which is presently manifest in our lives. This position represents our conscious awareness and the outcomes or results which we are now experiencing. Physically this node represents our physical body, musically it represents the note ‘Do’, and angelically it depicts the archangel Sandalphon. In astrology, this position is ruled by the Ascendant, or Rising Sign, and reflects the personality that we show to others. We can use the energy of Malkuth to help us determine exactly what lifestyle we would like to achieve and then conduct ourselves accordingly. For example, a person whose Malkuth is placed in the sign of Virgo would tend to be very analytical and approach life in a rather modest manner as not to draw undue attention to himself. 

==Yesod==
[[Yesod (Kabbalah)|Yesod]] is position 9 of the Tree of Life and is associated with the keyword Foundation. This sephira denotes the collective unconscious or the vital soul of humanity. It gives insight into our life patterns because it shows our unconscious thoughts, secrets, hopes, desires, fears and apprehensions. This focal point also indicates health matters, especially those which concern our overall well-being. Physically this node represents our ego and angelically it depicts the archangel Gabriel. In astrology this position corresponds with the Moon as it relates to our relationship with the world around us and how we interact with others. We can use the energy of Yesod best by determining how best to react to life’s events. Quite often we respond to stimulus without thinking of the consequences of our actions. It would be far wiser, however, to carefully contemplate any possible outcomes before pursuing any endeavours.

==Hod==
[[Hod (Kabbalah)|Hod]] is position 8 of the Tree of Life and is associated with the keyword Splendour. This sephira depicts worldly matters such as business, career, cultural and artistic endeavours, and how these areas in our lives are being approached. It represents our analytical thought processes, our style of communication, and how we perceive our environment around us. Physically this node represents the theoretical aspects of life, musically it represents ‘Ti’, and angelically it depicts the archangel Michael. In astrology the position corresponds with the planet Mercury and therefore influences our thought processes and how we communicate with others. We can use the energy of Hod by determining how it will best aid our thought processes and acting appropriately. If, for example, Hod is placed in any of the water signs of Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces, we will think emotionally, and this sense of feeling will affect how we behave towards others. In instances like this, it is best to analyse our perceptions before reacting on them to minimise any misunderstandings which may otherwise arise.

==Netzach==
[[Netzach (Kabbalah)|Netzach]] is in position 7 of the Tree of Life and is associated with the keyword Victory. It represents our emotional attachments and feelings. This sephira tells us what we desire, what we are attracted to, and what type of people we form close relationships with. Physically this node represents the practical aspects of life, musically it represents ‘La’, and angelically it depicts the archangel Haniel. In astrology this position corresponds with the planet Venus and defines those things that we find to be attractive. We can use the energy of Netzach most effectively by analysing what gives us pleasure and focusing on achieving the most positive aspects of them. For example, if Hod is placed in the sign of Pisces, then we will have a tendency to view our attachments unrealistically and must therefore work hard to pierce through the veil of confusion which will ultimately reveal our heart’s desire.

==Tiphereth==
[[Tiphereth (Kabbalah)|Tiphereth]] is position 6 of the Tree of Life and is associated with the keyword Beauty. It represents our higher self or true soul. It discusses the more highly evolved meaning of our lives and helps to define our life purposes, ideals and objectives. This sephira depicts our achievements, successes and outer image we present to the world. This position is in the centre of the Trestleboard and represents the centre of our being. In the physical world this node represents the self and angelically it depicts the archangel Raphael. In astrology Tipareth corresponds with the Sun and therefore is a key to the vitality we seek throughout our sojourns. We can use the energy of Tiperath most effectively by trying to project the most positive aspects of our characters. For instance, if Tiperath is placed in the sign of Aquarius we would want to display the friendly, sociable and intelligent attitudes of this sign. 

==Gevurah==
[[Gevurah (Kabbalah)|Gevurah]] is position 5 of the Tree of Life and is associated with the keyword Restraint. It represents the conflicts and challenges we must overcome and the lessons we must learn. These assignments are generally seen as oppositions we encounter, and unless appreciated for the strengthening qualities they impart will tend to be seen as trials, tribulations and limitations. This position also tells us the qualities we must hone in order to effectively deal with difficulties. Using the constructive influence of this position can help us to take greater responsibility for our lives and make assets out of those areas which were once considered to be liabilities. Physically this node represents discipline, musically it corresponds with ‘Sol’, and angelically it depicts the archangel Kamael. In astrology this position corresponds with the planet Mars and therefore possess a great driving force which helps to carry on even when weary. We can most effectively use the energy of Geborah by focusing our activities on those areas which will bring us the most satisfaction. For instance, if Geborah is placed in the maternal sign of Cancer then we would gain the highest achievement by engaging in family activities and looking after those who we care about.

==Chesed==
[[Chesed (Kabbalah)|Chesed]] is position 4 of the Tree of Life and is associated with the keyword Lovingkindness. It represents our opportunities for growth and rewards for the challenges we master. It indicates the most positive results we can gain from our thoughts, emotions and actions, and shows us where we must exercise compassion. Chesed reflects the most positive aspects of all areas - even those that seem negative. This position provides us with a 'comfort zone' in our lives because it gives us a sense of security. It also denotes our finances, wealth and areas of abundance. Physically this node represents compassion, musically it represents ‘Fa’, and angelically it denotes the archangel Tzadqiel. In astrology Chesed corresponds with the planet Jupiter and as a consequence shows us those areas of our lives where we will be given many avenues that we can excel in. We can most effectively use the benefits of Chesed by determining what areas of our lives will bear the most fruit. For example, if Chesed is placed in the sign of Capricorn, then we would want to focus our attention on developing our organisational skills and maintaining a sense of responsibility even when we would prefer to remain carefree.

==Binah==
[[Binah (Kabbalah)|Binah]] is position 3 of the Tree of Life and is associated with the keyword Understanding. It is the feminine, right brain or left side of ourselves, and represents inner knowledge or the divine mother within us. Binah often depicts our intuitive processes and the areas we are receptive to. This position shows what experiences we have chosen to bring to experience through the process of manifestation and denotes those areas which tend to be limiting or containing, thus helping to give greater understanding and depth through dealing constructively with these difficulties. Physically this node represents reason, musically it represent the note ‘Mi’, and angelically it depicts the archangel Tzaphqiel. In astrology this position corresponds with the planet Saturn and presents stabilising forces to help us carry out our chosen obligations. We can most effectively use the energy inherent in Binah to determine what karmic influences we have entered into this incarnation with by analysing what sign and house our it is posited in. For instance, if Binah is in Capricorn in the sixth house, we can channel our life lessons through carrying out our duties in an honest and responsible manner to achieve the greatest fulfilment. 

==Chokmah==
[[Chokmah (Kabbalah)|Chokmah]] is position 2 of the Tree of Life and is associated with the keyword Wisdom. It is associated with the masculine, right side of ourselves and is sometimes depicted as the cosmic father within us. Chokmah represents our learned behaviour, actions and shows were our responsibilities lie. It indicates our ability to use rationale and logic to make choices and decisions. Physically this node represents revelation, musically it depicts the note ‘Re’, and angelically it depicts the archangel Raziel. In astrology the position corresponds with Uranus which can quite often be best described as the more inspired aspects of ourselves. We can most effectively make use of the positive qualities of Chokmah by looking at those areas in our lives which require us to make a choice. For instance, if Chokmah is placed in the sign of Leo then we will quite often find that we must frequently make changes in those things that we love in order to continually grow and evolve as human beings. 

==Keter==
[[Keter (Kabbalah)|Keter]] is position 1 of the Tree of Life and is associated with the keyword Crown. It represents our creative potentials and new beginnings. Kether depicts our spiritual world, religious attitudes, and general inner state of being. This sephira is considered the indivisible one and is therefore complete in itself. It shows what we have chosen to manifest and what we desire to accomplish through our life experiences. Musically this node represents the note ‘Do’ and angelically it depicts the archangel Metatron. This sephira is the last point we must encounter on our path to universal oneness and is therefore associated with the veiled planet, Neptune. We can most effectively use the energy inherent in Kether by understanding that whatever sign it is placed in will be the area of our selves that we have a propensity to view unrealistically. Therefore, we need to analyse our perceptions to make sure that they are realistic. For instance, if Kether is placed in the sign of Scorpio then we will have a great deal to learn about our intense feelings that at times seem insurmountable and can cause us disillusionment until we are able to transcend these emotions. 

==Da'at==
[[Da'at (Kabbalah)|Da'at]] is an invisible sephiroth between Tiferet and Keter. It is an interfacing node which gives the entire tree a sense of completion. It is considered to be a place where we must cross to pass through the abyss to achieve enlightenment and represents the powerful knowledge which we have within ourselves. Astrologically it is ruled by the planet Pluto and depicts the transformation which must take place in order for us to ascend to higher stages in our evolutionary path. In order to gain the most positive effect from Daath we must determine what areas of our lives must be transformed and be accepting of the changes that we must inevitably make. For example, if our Daath is placed in the sign of Virgo then we will likely change jobs frequently until we find the one that gives us the most satisfaction.
