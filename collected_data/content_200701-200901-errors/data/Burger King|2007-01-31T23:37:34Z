'''''Burger King''''' is a large international [[chain store|chain]] of [[fast food]] restaurants, predominantly selling [[burger]]s, [[french fries]], [[soft drink]]s, [[dessert]]s, and various sandwiches.  '''Hungry Jack's''' is a [[franchising|franchisee]] of Burger King that owns, operates and franchises over 300 restaurants in [[Australia]].

==Corporate Profile ==
===History===
Burger King's first restaurant, originally called '''Insta Burger King''', was opened on [[December 4]], [[1954]] in a suburb of [[Miami, Florida]], [[United States|USA]] by [[James McLamore]] and [[David Edgerton]], who were both alumni of the [[Cornell University School of Hotel Administration]]. McLamore had visited the hamburger stand belonging to [[Dick and Mac McDonald]] in [[San Bernardino, California]]; being able to sense potential in their innovative [[assembly line]]-based production system, he decided to create a version of his own.

Coincidentally, the McDonald Brothers's milkshake machine was sold to them by [[Ray Kroc]], who later bought the [[McDonald's]] restaurant chain from them and oversaw its worldwide expansion.

In 1967, Burger King was bought by [[Pillsbury Bakery|Pillsbury]], which was bought by Grand Metropolitan PLC of Britain in 1988.

In 1989, the Burger King brand acquired many locations of its major [[UK]] rival [[Wimpy Bar|Wimpy]] when its parent company bought the brand from its previous owner [[United Biscuits]] and re-branded them as "Burger King", giving it an even greater presence in that country. While other "Wimpy" locations are still trading today (now independent from BK) they no longer have the presence they once did (the market is now dominated by Burger King and the larger McDonald's).

In 1997, Grand Metropolitan merged with [[Guinness]] to form a company called [[Diageo]].

On Friday, [[December 13]], [[2002]], Burger King was purchased from Diageo for $1.5 (US) billion by a [[private equity]] group headed by [[Stanley Foster]] and the investment firm [[Texas Pacific Group]] (TPG)<ref>[http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/1113/p01s01-usec.html "Are private buyouts good for the economy?"], By Mark Trumbull ; [[13 November]] [[2006]], ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]''</ref>. The company planned to go public within the next two years, though this was delayed until 2006. The new owners, through several new CEOs, revitalized the company; they realized about $367 million of the [[dividend]]s.

On [[February 1]], [[2006]], CEO [[Greg Brenneman]] announced TPG's plans to turn Burger King into a publicly traded company by issuing an [[Initial public offering|Initial Public Offering]]. On February 16, the company announced it had filed its registration for the IPO with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]]. On [[May 18]], [[2006]], Burger King began trading on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] under the ticker symbol BKC.

===Trademark disputes===
[[Image:Green_Zone_Burger_King.jpg|right|thumb|280px|Burger King, [[Green Zone]], [[Iraq]]]]

As it expanded in the United States, Burger King found that smaller operations had previously been using the name. One such restaurant in [[Mattoon, Illinois]] negotiated a settlement that forbids the chain from opening locations within 20 miles (32 km). See [[Burger King (Mattoon, Illinois)]].

In a trademark settlement with San Antonio local chain Whopper Burger, Burger King was not allowed to open locations within two counties of the city. The chain was ultimately bought out in the mid 80s, opening the way for San Antonio Burger King locations.

A trademark conflict also arose in Australia; see [[Burger King#HungryJacks|Hungry Jack's]], below.

===Facts and figures===

Burger King Holdings is the parent company of Burger King, in the [[US]] it operates under the Burger King Brands title while internationally it operates under the Burger King Corporation banner. It is a publicly traded company with investment firms of Texas Pacific Group, Bain Capital, and Goldman Sachs each owning about 25% of the company.

Historically, Burger King has been the second largest burger chain in North America, behind [[McDonald's]]. However, Burger King's revenues and market share have been declining. In the early 2000s, Burger King fell to a near tie for second place with [[Wendy's]]. Burger King has been closing under-performing stores and changing its marketing strategy in an attempt to turn its fortunes around. In fiscal year [[2002]], the firm had [[United States dollar|US $]]11.3 billion in total sales.

[[As of 2006]], there are more than 11,220 Burger King outlets in 61 countries. 66% of the restaurants are in the United States. The company has more than 340,000 employees who serve approximately 11.4 million customers daily.

Almost 90% of Burger King restaurants are privately owned and operated, or [[franchising|franchised]]. While Burger King Corporation sets standards for exterior store appearance, food quality and menu, individual owners have control over hours of operations, interior decor, pricing and staff uniforms and wages. For example, [[Magic Johnson]]'s company [[Magic Johnson Enterprises]] purchased 30 Burger King stores on [[June 7]], [[2004]]. The stores were redecorated with a sports memorabilia theme. These locations officially reopened on [[December 3]], [[2004]].

Burger King has a longstanding presence at [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] and [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] installations worldwide, dating back to the 1980s under a contract with [[Army and Air Force Exchange Service]]. Today, while other chains such as [[Taco Bell]], [[Popeye's]] and [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] have a presence on military bases, virtually every major Army and Air Force installation hosts a BK restaurant. 
Many Burger King outlets, even inside cities, require customers to operate a motor vehicle to purchase food during late evening hours.

Burger King is one of the few companies that does not accept communication via email.

==Hungry Jack's profile==
[[Image:Hungry.Jack's.Logo.gif|thumb|left|Hungry Jack's Logo, similar to that of the previous Burger King Logo]]

When Burger King decided to expand its operations into [[Australia]], it found that its business name was already [[trademark]]ed by a man running a small takeaway food shop. In consequence, the Australian franchisee, [[Jack Cowin]], was provided by Burger King with a list of possible alternative names that Australian Burger King restaurants could be branded as. These names were derived from pre-existing trademarks already registered by Burger King and [[Pillsbury]] (which was, at that time, the parent company of Burger King). Cowin selected the branding '''Hungry Jack's''', echoing his name and sentiment. 'Hungry Jacks' - without the apostrophe - was actually a Pillsbury brand, being used in the US to market [[pancake]] (flapjack) mixture. Accordingly, the first Australian franchise of the Burger King Corporation, established in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] in 1971, was branded as Hungry Jack's. 

In 1986, Hungry Jack's purchased 11 failing Australian [[Wendy's Old Fashioned Hamburgers]] locations and rebranded them under the Hungry Jack's name.

=== 1996 to 2001 ===

When the existing Australian registered trademark for Burger King lapsed in [[1996]], the American parent company wanted [[Jack Cowin|Cowin]] to change the Hungry Jack's outlets over to the Burger King name. Cowin resisted the change, but despite this Burger King proceeded between [[1996]] and [[2003]] to open more than seventy outlets in [[Australia]] under the Burger King name. These built on their existing stores in international airports &ndash; the international territory apparently outside the Cowin licensing deal. In some cases the new Burger King outlets were located very close to existing Hungry Jack's outlets.

==== Legal Proceedings ====

As a result of Burger King's actions, Hungry Jacks Pty. Ltd. began legal proceedings in [[Australia]] against the Burger King Corporation citing violation of the master franchising agreement.

In [[2001]], the case was finally resolved in favour of Hungry Jack's in a case that eventually included the Australian operating arm of [[Royal Dutch Shell]], and as a result Burger King Corporation was ordered to pay $AUD 75 million to Hungry Jack's for breach of its franchise agreement ({{Cite Case AU|NSWCA|187|2001}}). One final attempt was made by Burger King to appeal the decision to the [[High Court of Australia]] ({{Cite Case AU|hcatranscripts|S157|1|2001}}) however this appeal was dismissed.

=== 2002 to the present day ===

In 2002, Burger King Australia exited the country and sold a 51% share of its Australian restaurants to TPF, the company that operates Burger King in New Zealand. In an attempt to improve rapidly falling sales, TPF re-branded its Burger King restaurants as Hungry Jack's in late 2003 believing that the Hungry Jack's name with its 30 year history was the stronger brand. A market research survey conducted six months after the re-branding showed that Burger King had been the preferred brand, and that the words most often chosen by respondents in the survey to describe Hungry Jack's were "slow" and "dated"{{fact}}. In mid 2005, TPF decided to exit the Australian market and sold its 51% share of the former Burger King sites to Hungry Jack's Pty Ltd, the company operated by Jack Cowin.

=== Operational nuances ===

[[Image:Hungry.Jack's.Slogan.gif|frame|right|The [[slogan]] "The burgers are better at Hungry Jack's" is well known in [[Australia]].]]While Burger King's logo has since changed to the "blue swirl" design, the Hungry Jack's logo is still ([[as of 2005]]) based on the previous Burger King logo, employing the simpler bun-and-filling motif.

Hungry Jack's sells the usual range of burgers but also offers an Australian specialty: the Aussie Burger. This burger is based on the traditional Australian [[fish and chips]] shop favorite, including fried egg, bacon, onion, and [[beetroot]], with the traditional meat, lettuce, and tomato. Hungry Jack's locations are required to follow any menu changes made by Burger King.

Hungry Jack's introduced a breakfast menu in late 2005 in three states ([[Queensland]], [[New South Wales]], and [[Northern Territory]]). It was subsequently introduced into the other states on [[October 31]]st [[2006]].

Hungry Jack's retains strong links with Perth, with the city's first team in the [[Australian Football League]]- the [[West Coast Eagles]]- having been sponsored by Hungry Jack's since their entry into the league in 1987.

Hungry Jack's has seen success with its Kids Club mascots, allowing children to have themed birthday parties at its restaurants, and also with its Kids Club Meals (similar to [[McDonald's]] [[Happy Meal]]) often using well known collectible toys; see [[Burger King Kingdom]].

Hungry Jack's in Australia has trademarked the new slogan 'Oh Yeah' which has featured in late 2005/early 2006 commercials. Other changes at Hungry Jack's include new fresh salads and deli-style baguettes.

Many larger Hungry Jack's stores in Australia, especially in [[Perth, Western Australia]], where the first Hungry Jack's store opened, have a 1950s/1960s styled theme. Background music from this era is played (sometimes through a 50s style Jukebox), and contemporary pictures and memorabilia are often hung around the stores. In larger sit-down style restaurants the seats and tables are laid out in a 1950s "Diner" style manner.

==Products==
'''Burger King''' predominantly sells [[hamburgers]], various types of [[chicken]] [[sandwiches]], [[french fries]], [[soft drinks]], and [[desserts]]. In many markets BK offers [[salads]] and [[vegetarian]] items, [[Wrap (food)|wraps]] and other localized fare. This section provides a brief sampling of items common to BK's company-wide menu, a more complete listing can be found in the '''[[Burger King Products]]''' article.

===Burgers===
[[Image:Burger_King_Whopper_Combo.jpg|right|thumb|280px|[[Whopper]] Combo with fries and drink]]
* Burger King's trademark product is a [[hamburger]] called the [[Whopper]]. The Whopper is also a line of sandwiches all made with the same ingredients. The regular Whopper has a 4 [[ounce]] burger patty, [[mayonnaise]], [[lettuce]], [[tomato]], [[ketchup]], [[onion]] and [[pickle]] on a [[sesame seed]] roll. It is available in all markets.

* The [[Angus Burger]] is a larger burger made with [[Angus beef]]. It is served with [[mayonnaise]], [[lettuce]], [[tomato]], [[onion]] and [[steak sauce]] on a [[corn]]-dusted [[bun]]. It is available in the North American, [[Spain|Spanish]] and [[UK]] markets. In [[Italy]] it is called the Big Boss Burger.

* The [[BK XXL]] line of sandwiches is a group of double [[cheeseburgers]] made with two 4 [[ounce]] burger patties similar to the double whopper sold in North America. The line is only sold in Europe.

* The BK [[Crown Jewels]] line is a group of sandwiches available in [[New Zealand]]. They are both beef and grilled chicken sandwiches with higher quality ingredients aimed at the adult market.

===Chicken & fish===
*BK has one market-wide chicken sandwich and several "secondary" ones that are offered on a regional basis. The [[Original Chicken Sandwich]] is the "main" chicken sandwich sold by BK. It is made with [[mayonnaise]] and [[lettuce]] and is served on a long [[sesame seed]] bun. It is available in all markets, except [[Australia]], under various names.

*BK offers several variations on its [[grilled]] chicken sandwich, none of which are sold company-wide.

*BK's primary chicken piece product is called [[Chicken Tenders]]. They are shaped and breaded pieces of [[deep-fried]], white-meat [[chicken]]. They are sold in the majority of its markets, sometimes under a different name: in [[Australia]], Chicken Tenders are marketed as Chicken Strips, and in [[Germany]] as King Nuggets.

* BK sells a fish sandwich that varies in size, ingredients and breads depending on the market it is sold.

===Breakfast===
As with most [[Fast food|QSR]] restaurants, Burger King's main breakfast menu products are breakfast sandwiches.
*The [[Croissan'Wich]] is the signature breakfast sandwich in the US. The Croissan'Wich is also a family of breakfast sandwiches in various sizes and configurations. It also sold international markets as the Croissant Sandwich.

*BK offers regional and international breakfast sandwiches made on various types of breads. that BK offers are bakery style [[rolls]], [[toast]], [[biscuits]], [[bagels]] or [[English muffins]].

*In most markets, breakfast sandwiches are usually made with a [[sausage]] [[patty]], [[egg (food)|eggs]] and [[American cheese]]. [[Bacon]], [[ham]]  or other local meats can be substituted for the sausage or the sandwiches can be made without any meat.

===Other products===
* Burger King's Kids Club Meals are offered to compete with the popular [[Happy Meal]] from [[McDonald's]] and the Wendy's Kid's Meal from [[Wendy's]]. In most markets three varieties form the Kids Meal base: Chicken Tenders, hamburger, or cheeseburger.

* Burger King has a line of [[Salads]] that are available in a variety of types, ingredients and sizes, depending in which country they are sold. Examples include [[garden salad]], [[Caesar salad]] and [[Greek salad]].

* BK offers several different types of desserts, primarily [[pies]] or [[torte]]s, [[donuts]], [[soft serve ice cream]] and [[sundae]]s. Flavors and fillings will vary upon the market sold.

* BK sells [[french fries]] ([[chips]] or [[pommes frites]]) and [[onion rings]] as [[side order]]s. In [[Turkey]] and Europe, they also sell [[potato]] wedges, a type of French fry that is thick cut and [[wedge]] shaped.  Burger King recently introduced a redesigned French fry container called the "Frypod", likely a [[portmanteau]] of fry and [[iPod]]. The Frypod is designed to fit into a car's [[cupholder]].

==Advertising==
This section provides a summary of the advertising programs Burger King has employed during its history. A more detailed history may be found in the [[Burger King Advertising]] article.

===History===
In the early to mid-1970s, Burger King ran a series of much-lampooned (but successful and catchy) television commercials in which its employees would sing: "Hold the pickles, hold the lettuce. Special orders don't upset us. All we ask is that you let us have it your way!" This advertising strategy aimed to contrast Burger King's flexibility with McDonald's famous rigidity.

Their first major cross-promotional success was in 1977 when they offered collectible glasses featuring characters from ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]''. The promotion was wildly successful, and the glasses are highly sought after to this day.

In 1982, Burger King created an advertising stir when it created a set of commercials featuring a then-4-year-old [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]], in which Gellar stated that McDonald's burgers were 20% smaller than Burger King's. Arguably the first attack ads on a food chain by a competitor, the campaign was controversial in that prior to it, fast food ads only made allusions to the competition in a vague manner, never mentioning them by name. McDonald's sued Burger King, the advertising agency that came up with the ads, and Gellar. The suit was settled the following year on undisclosed terms.

====Where's Herb====

In November 1985, Burger King spent $40 million on the “Where’s Herb?” advertising campaign. The company stated that Herb was the only man in America who had never eaten a Whopper. If a customer located him in any store, he or she would win $5,000. Burger King purposely chose not to reveal what Herb looked like, resulting in annoyance among its patrons. In a [[Super Bowl XX]] commercial, Burger King finally revealed Herb as a bespectacled [[nerd]] in an ill-fitting suit. <ref>[http://www.time.com/time/archive/printout/0,23657,960538,00.html Herb Comes Out of Hiding]; [[3 February]] [[1986]], [[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]</ref>  Unfortunately, the message that Herb was a nerd because he had never eaten a Whopper was often misunderstood by viewers, many of whom interpreted the advertisements as showing that nerds ate at Burger King.

Herb toured stores across the country, appeared on ''[[The Today Show]]'', and served as a guest referee during [[Wrestlemania 2]]. The campaign had little impact on sales and was quickly dropped. According to ''[[Advertising Age]]'' magazine, the Herb campaign was the "most elaborate advertising flop of the decade.” <ref>[http://www.tvacres.com/admascots_herb.htm Advertising Mascots, Herb the Nerd] [http://www.tvacres.com/ TVAcres.com]</ref>   The campaign also brought the condemnation of the [[Alabama legislature]] following one of the customers who attempted claim the prize complained to his state senator after being told that, at age 15, he was too young to win the $5,000.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,961331,00.html Business Notes Promotions], Time, May 12, 1986</ref>

====BK Tee Vee====

In the early 1990s, Burger King advertised introduced its new dinner offering, dinner baskets and table service, with the "BK Tee Vee" (or "BKTV") ad campaign. The taglines for the campaign were "BK Tee Vee... I Love this Place!" and "Your Way Right Away!", which featured [[Dan Cortese]] as "Dan: The Whopper Man."

===Current advertising===
The [[Miami]] based advertising firm of [[Crispin Porter and Bogusky|Crispin Porter + Bogusky]] took over the advertising account of BK on [[January 27]], [[2003]]<ref>[http://www.hispanicbusiness.com/news/newsbyid.asp?id=14482 Burger King Corporation Selects Crispin Porter + Bogusky As Lead Creative Advertising Agency] via PR Newswire; [[23 January]] [[2006]], [http://www.HispanicBusiness.com HispanicBusiness.com]</ref>. Employing the advertising technique called [[Viral Marketing]], CP+B's ads generated significant word of mouth and for its new use of what has been called the '''[[Creepy King]]'''. The [[Creepy King]] is an actor who wears an over-sized, grinning mask of that is a [[caricature]] of the original Magical Burger King character used in BK's children advertising from the late 1970s to early 1980s ([[Burger King#Children's advertising (US)|see below]]).

The "Creepy King" was first used to advertise the chain's breakfast sandwiches. Additionally, the character has appeared in the [[tie-in]] promotion of the film ''[[Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith]]'', commercials for a cross-promotion with the [[NFL]] and [[DirecTV]]'s NFL Sunday Ticket sports subscription package. In the promotion, a code entered from the wrapper from an [[Angus]] burger sandwich could net several prizes, including free access to the Sunday Ticket package [http://www.nflyourway.com NFL Your Way promotion].

CP+B went on to create several other strange characters and websites including the '''[[The Subservient Chicken]]'''<ref>[http://www.snopes.com/business/viral/chicken.asp The suberviant Chicken FAQ on Snopes.com]</ref>, featuring a person (presumably) in a chicken costume, who supposedly does, within reason, whatever he is told to, advertising the [[TenderCrisp]] chicken sandwich; a faux metal band called '''[[Coq Roq]]''', who wore chicken masks parodying the style of masks of [[nu metal]] band [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], used to advertise [[BK Chicken Fries]]; '''[http://www.Sithsense.com Sith Sense]''' was a of the [[Revenge of the Sith]] tie-in campaign, with an image of [[Star Wars]]'s [[Darth Vader]] utilizing a [[20 Questions]] answering program; the '''[[Big Buckin' Chicken]]''', to advertise the [[TenderCrisp]] Cheesy Bacon Chicken Sandwich; and [[the Whopperettes]], women dressed as burger condiments who appear with the King in a Broadway-style show.

In November 2006, Burger Kings sold a set of three [[advergaming]] titles for the [[Xbox]] and [[Xbox 360]] entitled ''[[Sneak King]]'', ''[[Pocketbike Racer]]'' and ''[[Big Bumpin']]'' for an additional $3.99 each with any value meal. The games featured many of the characters that CP+B had created for BK. In ''Pocketbike Racing'' and ''Big Bumpin''' players could choose to play as the '''Subservient Chicken''', members of the '''Coq Roq''' band, the '''Whopper Jr.''' or '''the Creepy King'''. The television  ads featured the King being filmed in a [[motion capture]] suit performing stunts for the games. Former [[Anthrax]]/[[Armored Saint]] Vocalist [[John Bush]] provided the narration. As of the end of [[December]], [[2006]], the games sold 3.2 million copies as another [[Xbox 360]] hit, ''[[Gears of War]]''.

In October 2006, Burger King rolled out a new design for both their drive-thru and dining room menu boards, expanding their Value meal selections to 12 items, from the previous 10.

====Hungry Jack's advertising====
The official slogan for Hungry Jacks, the Australian version of Burger King, has been for many years and currently is: "The burgers are better at Hungry Jacks."

===Children's advertising (US)===
Starting in the [[1970s]] and running into the [[1980s]], BK had a generic Kids' Club that gave children coupons for selected products each month, a small toy that rotated on a monthly or weekly basis, and an extra surprise if it was the child's birthday. Burger King has been known for its longtime giveaway of free paper crowns, which are sometimes redesigned to match any promotions the restaurant may be running.

The original advertising featured a small, animated King. The King would travel around on a modified [[chopper (motorcycle)|chopper]] with a [[throne]] as the seat and visit a BK and present the children with small gifts. The tag line was ''"Burger King: Where kids are King!"''

The original animated King was soon replaced by the "Marvelous Magical Burger King", a red-bearded king who ruled the Burger King Kingdom and performed magic tricks (mostly sleight-of-hand, but sometimes relying on camera tricks). This campaign paralleled McDonald's children's commercials, which featured "[[Ronald McDonald]]", "[[The Hamburglar]]", and "[[Mayor McCheese]]", along with other characters and mascots.

Other characters of the Burger King Kingdom included:
* "The Duke of Doubt", the King's arch nemesis, who constantly tried to prove that the King's magic was not real;
* the "Burger Thing", a large, 3-d painting of a hamburger that talked;
* "Sir Shakes-a-Lot", a knight with a craving for Burger King milkshakes and armor made of BK Cups;
* the "Wizard of Fries", a robot who could "multifry", or generated french fries when given a sample.

Originally, BK would only offer a kids' meal when it had a cross promotion with an children's orientated product such as a film or a holiday. With the success of McDonald's [[Happy Meal]] in the late [[1970s]], BK introduced its own permanent kids meal, called the Kids' Meal Pack, in [[1985]] with a [[He-Man]] cross promotion. In [[June]] of [[1999]] BK introduced the Big Kids' Meal aimed at the [[preteen]] market with larger portions, which forced McDonald's to introduce its [[Mighty Kids Meal]].

====Kids' Club====
In 1990, Burger King re-launched it kids' meal program as the '''Burger King Kids' Club''' meal across the [[United States]], which continues in operation to this day and is the largest club of its kind in North America. Club members receive an annual mailing in the month of their birthday that contains games, product information, and a birthday gift in the form of a coupon for a free Kids' Meal.

The '''Burger King Kids Club Gang''' was a group of [[multi-ethnic]] [[fictional characters]] created to promote the Burger King Kids Club meal. Their names were:

* Boomer, a sports loving [[tomboy]] with red hair;
* I.Q., male [[nerd]] who wore red glasses, a green lab coat, and a [[pocket protector]];
* Jaws, A tall [[African-American]] male with an insatiable appetite;
* J.D., a dog and the group's mascot;
* Kid Vid, a male who loves [[video games]] and technology (leader of the group);
* Lingo, an [[multi-lingual]], [[Hispanic]] male who likes art and carried an easel; 
* Snaps, a female who always carries her [[camera]];
* Wheels, a [[parapalegic]] male in a [[wheelchair]].

After several years a new female character was added to the group: 
* Jazz, an [[Asian]] girl who loves music and sports a [[beret]].

Each of the characters' signatures reflected their personality, e.g. Boomer signed her name with a [[football]] and [[baseball]] for the "O"s.

====Honbatz====
In 2005, the Kids' Club Gang were replaced by the Honbatz, odd creatures who were designed to replace nearly twenty year old Kids' Club gang with a more modern group of characters that would appeal to the [[tween]] market.<ref>[http://www.kidscreen.com/articles/magazine/20050601/bk.html Burger King beefs up its global tween icon], by Lianne Stewart; [[June 1]], [[2005]], KidScreen Magazine.</ref> Each Honbatz has a personality that you would find in modern [[elementary school]]: the class clown, the brain or the rebellious one.

The new group consisted of:
* Mixmax, a punk who likes showing off;
* Thisorthat, a green monster that likes to eat everything but can't decide where to start;
* Bonny, the studious one and the only girl in the group;
* Chomp, an intimidating, large Honbatz, who is really a big softie that wants to fit in;
* the Eeeps, a group of small, red, ketchup-craving creatures.

They have appeared in numerous ads.

====The return of the King====
In September 2006 BK began using the original animated King design from the 1970s on its cups, bags and in non [[tie-in]] kids advertising. The new (old) King is portrayed as a sarcastic type who sometimes gets in trouble for his mischief making adventures.

====Children's advertising (Europe)====
The European Kids' Club paperbags feature two youngsters, a female[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Bk-km_female.JPG] and a male[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Bk-km_male.JPG] character on the cover. The names of the youngsters are not featured on the paperbags or any official Burger King sites, even though they are on the cover.

===Slogans===

== The King ==

The new icon of the Burger King restaurants is a stealthy man known as The King whom sneaks around surprising people with a handy meal such as a whopper.  This new icon has attracted many American children and the ones with "A sense of humor".  Of course this new icon was imported into $4 games sold at Burger King with any value meal. A recommendation:  Try these deliciously stealthy burgers of satisfaction and enjoy yourself.

[[Image:Hungry.Jack's.Logo.gif|thumb|Hungry Jack's "bun halves" logo]]

The famous Burger King "bun halves" logo made its debut in 1969 and endured well into the 1990s. As its name implies, it was meant to resemble a [[hamburger]]: the logo had two orange semi-circular "buns" surrounding the name, which was the "meat" of the logo. In 1994 BK updated the logo with a graphical tightening, replacing the aging "bulging" font with a smoother font with rounded edges. In addition, all secondary signing, such as roof and directional signs, was also updated with new rounded font.

In 1999, BK again revised its logo. The new Burger King logo is a stylized version of the original "bun halves" logo. BK changed the color the restaurant's name from orange to red lettering, while leaving them sandwiched between two yellow bun halves. The new logo also tilts the bun halves and the [[font]] on an [[Coordinate axis|axis]], has a smaller "bun" motif and wraps the burger with a blue swirl giving it a more [[circular]] appearance. Most restaurants did not acquire newer signs with the new logo until 2001. Again all secondary signage was updated with the new logo and type face, and all sign posts were repainted to match the blue coloring of the new swirl from their original black.

The Hungry Jack's logo is based on the original Burger King "bun halves" design, and has been used since Hungry Jack's founding in 1971. HJ currently uses an updated version of the "bun halves" logo, featuring the smoother font used in revised Burger King logo from 1994.
