'''Jordan''' ({{lang-ar|<big>'''الأردنّ'''</big>}}, [[Transliteration|transliterated]] as {{unicode|Al-Urdunn}}), officially the '''[[Hashemite]] Kingdom of Jordan''' (Arabic: <big>'''المملكة الأردنية الهاشمية'''</big>), is a country in the [[Arab World]] in western [[Asia]], bordered by [[Syria]] to the north, [[Iraq]] to the north-east, [[Israel]] and [[Palestine]] to the west, and [[Saudi Arabia]] to the east and south. It shares with Israel the coastlines of the [[Dead Sea]], and the [[Gulf of Aqaba]] with Palestine, Saudi Arabia, and [[Egypt]].
==History==
[[Image:Petra Treasury.jpg|thumb|150px|left|The ancient city of [[Petra]].]]
{{main|History of Jordan}}
===Beginnings===
With the break-up of the Ottoman Empire at the end of [[World War I]], the [[League of Nations]] created the [[French Mandate of Syria]] and British Mandate Palestine. Approximately 80% of the [[British Mandate of Palestine]] was east of the [[Jordan river]] and was known as "[[Transjordan]]". In 1921, the British gave semi-autonomous control of Transjordan to the future King [[Abdullah I of Jordan]], of the [[Hashemite]] family.

Abdullah I continued to rule until he was assassinated in 1951 by a Palestinian Arab on the steps of the Mosque of Omar. At first he ruled "Transjordan", under British supervision until after [[World War II]]. In 1946, the British requested that the United Nations approve an end to British Mandate rule in Transjordan. Following this approval, the Jordanian Parliament proclaimed King Abdullah as the first ruler of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.

In 1950, Jordan annexed the [[West Bank]], which had been under its control since the armistice that followed the [[1948 Arab-Israeli war]]. The annexation was recognized only by Great Britain (''de facto'' in the case of East Jerusalem).
[[Image:Kingabdullahbinhussein.jpg|thumb|150px|right|King Abdullah I.]]

In 1965 there was an exchange of land between [[Saudi Arabia]] and Jordan. Jordan gave up a relatively large area of inland desert in return for a small piece of sea-shore near [[Aqaba]].

Jordan signed a mutual defence pact in May 1967 with Egypt, and it participated in the [[Six Day War|June 1967 war]] against [[Israel]] along with [[Syria]], [[Egypt]], and [[Iraq]]. During the war, Jordan lost the [[West Bank]] and East [[Jerusalem]] to Israel (the western sector having been under Israeli control). In 1988, Jordan renounced all claims to the West Bank but retained an administrative role pending a final settlement, and its 1994 treaty with Israel allowed for a continuing Jordanian role in Muslim and Christian holy places in Jerusalem.

===Trouble with Egypt and Syria===
After the end of the Suez war, Arab nations cut off diplomatic relations with Israel, the U.S., France, and the U.K.  When Jordan did not sever relations with western powers, tension increased between Jordan and its Arab neighbors, especially Egypt and Syria.  Lebanon followed Jordan's course of action but took it a step forward which resulted in American troops landing in Beirut.  
Jordan hoped this would not happen, but King Hussein felt threatened by Egypt and Syria when they united to form the [[United Arab Republic]].  Jordan and Iraq then formed the [[Arab Federation of Iraq and Jordan]] which broke apart after Iraq's king was deposed.  King Hussein believed Syria was sheltering militants hostile to Jordan.  Tensions would increase in further years, especially after the end of the Six-Day War.

===Refugees and Black September===
The 1967 war led to a dramatic increase in the number of Palestinians, especially from the West Bank, living in Jordan. Its Palestinian refugee population — 700,000 in 1966 — grew by another 300,000 from the West Bank. The period following the 1967 war saw an upsurge in the power and importance of Palestinian resistance elements (''fedayeen'') in Jordan. The heavily armed ''fedayeen'' constituted a growing threat to the sovereignty and security of the Hashemite state, and open fighting erupted in June 1970. The battle in which Palestinian fighters from various [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) groups were expelled from Jordan is commonly known as [[Black September in Jordan|Black September]].
[[Image:Hussein of Jordan 1997.jpg|150px|thumb|right|King Hussein]]
The heaviest fighting occurred in northern Jordan and Amman.  Syrian backed infantry battled the Jordanian army in Amman and other urban areas. Egypt worked with the global media to try and portray King Hussein as a corrupt King slaughtering the Palestinian refugees.  Other Arab governments attempted to work out a peaceful solution, but by September, continuing ''fedayeen'' actions in Jordan — including the destruction of three international airliners hijacked by the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] and held in the desert east of [[Amman]] — prompted the government to take action to regain control over its territory and population. In the ensuing heavy fighting, a Syrian tank force invaded northern Jordan to support the ''fedayeen'' but subsequently retreated. It is said by some people, such as [[Ahmed Jibril]]<!-- Who is he? How his saying is relevant? -->, that King [[Hussein of Jordan|Hussein]] asked for help from Israel,<ref name = "Jazeera">{{ar icon}} [http://www.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/F8CB417C-1AB0-47B7-9F7D-7EBCFB6D2FC5 Aljazeera.net article].</ref> then Israel threatened that it would invade Jordan if Syria intervened.<ref name = "HistoryCentral">[http://www.historycentral.com/mideast/BlkSept.html Black September] at History Central.</ref><ref name = "PalestineFacts">[http://www.palestinefacts.org/pf_1967to1991_jordan_expel_plo.php Jordan Expels the PLO in 1970], Palestine Facts.</ref> By [[September 22]], Arab foreign ministers meeting at Cairo had arranged a cease-fire beginning the following day. Sporadic violence continued, however, until Jordanian forces led by [[Habis Al-Majali]] with the help of the Iraqi forces (who had bases in Jordan after the war of 1967)<ref name = "Jazeera" />, won a decisive victory over the ''fedayeen'' on July 1971, expelling them from the country.

At the [[Rabat summit conference]] in 1974, Jordan agreed, along with the rest of the [[Arab League]], that the PLO was the "sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people", thereby relinquishing to that organization its role as representative of the West Bank.

===Post Black September and Peace Treaty===
Fighting occurred along the 1967 Jordan River cease-fire line during the [[Yom Kippur War|October 1973 Arab-Israeli war]], but Jordan sent a brigade to Syria to fight Israeli units on Syrian territory. Jordan did not participate in the [[Gulf War]] of 1990–91. In 1991, Jordan agreed, along with Syria, [[Lebanon]], and [[Palestinian]] fedayeen representatives, to participate in direct peace negotiations with Israel at the [[Madrid Conference]], sponsored by the U.S. and [[Russia]]. It negotiated an end to hostilities with Israel and signed a declaration to that effect on [[July 25]], [[1994]] (see [[Washington Declaration]]). As a result, an [[Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace|Israeli-Jordanian peace treaty]] was concluded on [[October 26]], [[1994]]. Following the outbreak of Israel-Palestinian Authority fighting in September 2000, the Jordanian government offered its good offices to both parties. Jordan has since sought to remain at peace with all of its neighbors.

===Recent events===
On [[November 9]], [[2005]] Jordan experienced [[2005 Amman bombings|three simultaneous bombings]] at hotels in Amman.  At least 57 people died and 115 were wounded. "[[Al-Qaeda]] in [[Iraq]]", a group led by terrorist [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]], [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi#Biography|a native Jordanian]], claimed responsibility.

On [[September 4]], [[2006]], a 38-year-old known criminal, took a pistol to a Roman amphitheatre in the capital of Amman and proceeded to shoot at a group of Western tourists. One British man was killed and five other tourists wounded, including a Jordanian tourist security guard. Later, in December of the same year, he was sentenced to death by hanging.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

==Politics==
[[Image:KingAbdullah2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Abdullah II of Jordan|King Abdullah II]], Jordanian Head of State.]]
{{main|Politics of Jordan}}<!--Please add new information to relevant articles of the series-->

===Constitution===
Jordan is a [[constitutional monarchy]] based on the [[constitution]] promulgated on [[January 8]] [[1952]]. [[Executive authority]] is vested in the [[King of Jordan|king]] and his council of ministers. The king signs and executes all laws. His [[veto]] power may be overridden by a two-thirds vote of both houses of the [[National Assembly of Jordan|National Assembly]]. He appoints and may dismiss all judges by decree, approves [[constitutional amendment|amendment]]s to the constitution, declares war, and commands the [[Military of Jordan|armed forces]]. [[Cabinet]] decisions, court judgments, and the national currency are issued in his name. The council of ministers, led by a [[Prime Minister of Jordan|prime minister]], is appointed by the king, who may dismiss other cabinet members at the prime minister's request. The cabinet is responsible to the [[Chamber of Deputies of Jordan|Chamber of Deputies]] on matters of general policy and can be forced to resign by a two-thirds vote of "no confidence" by that body.

The constitution provides for three categories of courts: [[civil court|civil]], religious, and special. Administratively, Jordan is divided into twelve [[governor]]ates, each headed by a governor appointed by the king. They are the sole authorities for all government departments and development projects in their respective areas.

The Royal Armed Forces and [[General Intelligence Department]] of Jordan are under the control of the king.

===Legal system and legislation===
Jordan's legal system is based on [[Islam]]ic law and [[France|French]] codes. Judicial review of legislative acts occurs in a special High Tribunal. It has not accepted compulsory [[International Court of Justice]] jurisdiction.

[[Legislature|Legislative]] power rests in the [[bicameral]] National Assembly. The 110-member Chamber of Deputies, elected by [[universal suffrage]] ("one person, one vote"), to a four-year term, is subject to dissolution by the king. Nine seats are reserved for Christians, six for women, and three for [[Circassians]] and [[Chechens]]. The forty-member [[Senate of Jordan|Senate]] is appointed by the king for a four-year term.

===Kings of Jordan and political events===
[[King Abdullah I]] ruled Jordan after independence from Britain. After the assassination of King Abdullah I in 1951, his son [[Talal of Jordan|King Talal]] ruled briefly. King Talal's major accomplishment was the Jordanian constitution. King Talal was removed from the throne in 1952 due to mental illness. At that time his son, [[Hussein of Jordan|Hussein]], was too young to rule, and hence a committee ruled over Jordan.

After Hussein reached 18, he ruled Jordan as king from 1953 to 1999, surviving a number of challenges to his rule, drawing on the loyalty of his military, and serving as a symbol of unity and stability for both the Bedouin-related and [[Palestinian]] communities in Jordan. King Hussein ended [[martial law]] in 1991 and [[Legalization|legalized]] [[Political party|political parties]] in 1992. In 1989 and 1993, Jordan held free and fair [[parliament]]ary elections. Controversial changes in the election law led [[Islam]]ist parties to boycott the 1997 elections. 

[[Abdullah II of Jordan|King Abdullah II]] succeeded his father Hussein following the latter's death in February 1999. Abdullah moved quickly to reaffirm Jordan's [[Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace|peace treaty]] with [[Israel]] and its relations with the [[United States]]. Abdullah, during the first year in power, refocused the government's agenda on economic reform.

Jordan's continuing structural economic difficulties, burgeoning population, and more open political environment led to the emergence of a variety of political parties. Moving toward greater independence, Jordan's parliament has investigated corruption charges against several regime figures and has become the major forum in which differing political views, including those of political Islamists, are expressed. While King Abdullah remains the ultimate authority in Jordan, the parliament plays an important role.

==Governorates and nahias ==
[[Image:Jordan.geohive.gif|thumb|250px|right|Governorates of Jordan]]
{{main|Governorates of Jordan|Nahias of Jordan}}
Administratively, Jordan is divided into 12 [[Governorates of Jordan|governorates]], each headed by a governor appointed by the king. They are the sole authorities for all government departments and development projects in their respective areas. The governorates are:
*[[Ajlun Governorate|Ajlun]]
*[[Amman Governorate|Amman]]
*[[Aqaba Governorate|Aqaba]]
*[[Balqa]]
*[[Irbid Governorate|Irbid]]
*[[Jerash Governorate|Jerash]]
*[[Kerak Governorate|Kerak]]
*[[Ma'an Governorate|Ma'an]]
*[[Madaba Governorate|Madaba]]
*[[Mafraq Governorate|Mafraq]]
*[[Tafilah Governorate|Tafilah]]
*[[Zarqa Governorate|Zarqa]]

The governorates are subdivided into approximately fifty-two ''[[nahia]]s''.

==Geography==
[[Image:Jo-map.png|thumb|Map of Jordan]]
{{main|Geography of Jordan}}
Jordan is a [[Middle East]]ern country, bordered by [[Syria]] to the north, [[Iraq]] to the northeast, [[Saudi Arabia]] to the east and south and [[Israel]] and the [[West Bank]] to the west. All these border lines add up to 1,619 kilometers (1,006&nbsp;[[mile|mi]]). The [[Gulf of Aqaba]] and the [[Dead Sea]] also touch the country, and thus Jordan has a coastline of 26 kilometers (16&nbsp;mi).

Jordan consists mostly of arid [[desert]] plateau in the east, with Highland area in the west. The [[Great Rift Valley]] of the [[Jordan River]] separates Jordan and Israel. The highest point in the country is [[Jabal Ram]] (1,734&nbsp;m; 5,689&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length|ft]]), while the lowest is the [[Dead Sea]] (-486&nbsp;m; -1,594&nbsp;ft). Jordan is part of a region considered to be "the [[Civilization|cradle of civilization]]".

Major cities include the capital [[Amman]] in the northwest, [[Irbid]] and [[Az Zarqa]], both in the north.

The climate in Jordan is dry and hot, since the country is mainly desert. However, the western part of the country receives greater precipitation during the rainy season from November to March.

==Economy==
[[Image:Four Seasons Amman.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Four Seasons Hotels|Four Seasons]] hotel in [[Amman]], Jordan's [[capital]].]]
{{main|Economy of Jordan}}
Jordan is a small country with limited [[natural resources]]. The country is currently exploring ways to expand its limited water supply and use its existing water resources more efficiently, including through regional cooperation. Jordan also depends on external sources for the majority of its energy requirements. During the 1990s, its crude petroleum needs were met through imports from [[Iraq]] and neighboring countries. Since early 2003, oil has been provided by some [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] member countries. In addition, the [[Arab Gas Pipeline]] from [[Egypt]] to the southern port city of [[Aqaba]] was completed in 2003.  The government plans to extend this pipeline north to the Amman area and beyond. Since 2000, exports of light manufactured products, principally textiles and garments manufactured in the Qualifying Industrial Zones (QIZ) that enter the United States tariff and quota free, have been driving economic growth. Jordan exported €5.6 million ($6.9 million) in goods to the U.S. in 1997, when two-way trade was €321 million ($395 million); it exported €538 million ($661 million) in 2002 with two-way trade at €855 million ($1.05 billion). Similar growth in exports to the United States under the bilateral [[US-Jordan Free Trade Agreement]] that went into effect in December 2001, to the European Union under the bilateral Association Agreement, and to countries in the region, holds considerable promise for diversifying Jordan's economy away from its traditional reliance on exports of phosphates and potash, overseas remittances, and foreign aid. The government has emphasized the information technology (IT) and tourism sectors as other promising growth sectors.  The low tax and low regulation Aqaba Special Economic Zone ([[ASEZ]]) is considered a model of a government-provided framework for private sector-led economic growth.

The Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United States<ref name = "JUSFTA">[http://www.jordanusfta.com  Jordan-US FTA].</ref> that went into effect in December 2001 will phase out duties on nearly all goods and services by 2010. The agreement also provides for more open markets in communications, construction, finance, health, transportation, and services, as well as strict application of international standards for the protection of intellectual property. In 1996, Jordan and the United States signed a civil aviation agreement that provides for "open skies" between the two countries, and a U.S.-Jordan treaty for the protection and encouragement of bilateral investment entered into force in 2003. Jordan has been a member of the [[World Trade Organization]] since 2000.

[[Textile]] and [[clothing]] exports from Jordan to the United States shot up 2,000 percent from 2000 to 2005, following introduction of the FTA. According to the [[National Labor Committee]], a U.S.-based NGO, Jordan has experienced sharp increases in [[sweatshop]] conditions in its [[export]]-oriented [[manufacturing]] sector.<ref name="NLCNet">[http://www.nlcnet.org/live/searchresults.php?country=Jordan NLCNet].</ref>

Jordan is classified by the [[World Bank]] as a "lower middle income country." The per-capita [[GDP]] was approximately $1,817 (€1,479) for 2003 and 14.5% of the economically active population, on average, was unemployed in 2003. The GDP per capita in 2005 is at $USD 4,200. Education and literacy rates and measures of social well-being are relatively high compared to other countries with similar incomes. Jordan's population growth rate is high, but has declined in recent years, to approximately 2.8% currently. One of the most important factors in the government’s efforts to improve the well-being of its citizens is the macroeconomic stability that has been achieved since the 1990s. However, unemployment rates remain high, with the official figure standing at 12.5%, and the unofficial around 30%. Rates of price inflation are low, at 2.3% in 2003, and the currency has been stable with an exchange rate fixed to the U.S. dollar since 1995.

While pursuing economic reform and increased trade, Jordan's economy will continue to be vulnerable to external shocks and regional unrest. Without calm in the region, economic growth seems destined to stay below  potential. On the positive side, however, there is huge potential in the solar energy falling on Jordan's deserts, not only for the generation of pollution-free electricity but also for such spin-offs as [[desalination|desalination of sea water]] (see [[Trans-Mediterranean Renewable Energy Cooperation]] (TREC)).

===Tourism===

Tourism is a very important sector of the Jordanian economy, contributing between 10 percent and 12 percent to the country's Gross National Product in 2006. In addition to the country's political stability, the geography offered makes Jordan an attractive tourism destination. Jordan's major tourist activities include numerous ancient places, its unique desert castles and unspoiled natural locations to its cultural and religious sites. The best known attractions include:

*Ancient sightseeing
**[[Petra]] in [[Ma'an]], the home of the [[Nabateans]], is a complete city carved in a mountain. The huge rocks are colorful, mostly pink, and the entrance to the ancient city is through a 1.25 km narrow gorge in the mountain - called the [[Siq]]. In the city are various structures, all (except 2) are carved into rock, including al Khazneh - known as the [[Treasury (Jordan)|Treasury]] - which has been designated as one of the "[[New Seven Wonders of the World]]" by the for-profit New Open World Corporation. Other major sites of interest in Petra include the Monastery, the Roman theatre, the Royal Tombs, the High Place of Sacrifice. Petra was rediscovered for the western world by Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt in 1812.
**[[Umm Qais]], a town located on the site of the ruined [[Hellenistic]]-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] city of Gadara.
**[[Ajlun]], famous for the [[Islam]]ic [[Ajlun Castle]].
**[[Jerash]], famous for its its ancient [[Roman architecture]], including the colonnaded streets, arches, Roman theatres, and the Oval Plaza.
**[[Amman]] contains the [[Roman theater (Jordan)|Roman theater]], in addition to several museums, where one may find remains of the Dead Sea Scrolls.
**[[Al Karak]] contains an important [[castle]] from the times of [[Saladin|Salah al-Din]], known as Al-Karak Castle.
*Religion-related
**[[Madaba]], well known for its mosaics, as well as important religious sites such as:
***The [[Madaba Map]].
***The [[River Jordan]], which is the [[river]] where [[Jesus Christ]] was [[Baptism|baptised]], by [[John the Baptist]].
***[[Mount Nebo (Jordan)|Mount Nebo]], where Moses was said to have gone to get a view of the Promised Land before he died.
*Seaside 
**The [[Dead Sea]] - It is the lowest point on earth, 402 [[meter]]s below [[sea level]],<ref>[http://ccrs.nrcan.gc.ca/radar/spaceborne/radarsat1/action/int/jor/index_e.php The Dead Sea], NPR</ref> and becomes 1 meter lower each year. It is located near [[River Jordan]].
[[Image:Dead-sea-JORDAN.jpg|right|thumb|200px|'''Dead Sea-Jordan''']]
**[[Aqaba]] is a town on the shore of the [[Gulf of Aqaba]] with numerous shopping centers, [[hotel]]s and access to water sports.
*Other Tourist Sites
**[[Wadi Rum]] is a [[desert]] full of [[mountain]]s and hills located south of Jordan. It is popular for its sights in addition to a variety of sports that are practiced there, such as rock-climbing.  It is also known for its connection to Lawrence of Arabia.
**Amman is a very modern city with lots of [[shopping mall]]s, shopping centers, hotels and an ancient Roman amphitheatre etc. 
**[[Mahis]] with important religious sites, and wonderful landscape.
**Al-Omwia's Palace which is placed to the north east of Jordan, with Islamic design

===Influence of the Middle East conflict===
The ongoing [[Arab-Israeli conflict]], the [[Gulf War]], and other conflicts in the [[Middle East]] have made huge impacts on the economy of Jordan. The fact that Jordan has [[peace treaty|peace]] with the surrounding countries, combined with its stability, has made it a preference for many [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]], [[Lebanon|Lebanese]], and people from the [[Persian Gulf]] [[immigrant]]s and [[refugee]]s. Though this may have resulted in a more active economy, it has also damaged it by substantially decreasing the amount of resources each person is entitled to. Jordan has a law that states that any Palestinian may immigrate and obtain Jordanian citizenship, but must remit his/her Palestinian claim. Palestinians are not allowed to purchase land unless they give up their Palestinian citizenship. In November 2005, King Abdullah called for a "war on extremism" in the wake of three suicide bombings in [[Amman]].

==Foreign relations==
[[Image:Abdullah II.jpg|thumb|250px|right|King Abdullah II on a visit to The Pentagon.]]
{{main|Foreign relations of Jordan}}
Jordan has consistently followed a pro-Western foreign policy and traditionally has had close relations with the United States and the United Kingdom. These relations were damaged by Jordan's neutrality and maintaining relations with Iraq during the first [[Gulf War]]. Jordan has a well earned reputation for usually following a pragmatic and non-confrontational foreign policy, leading to fair relations with its neighbours.

Following the Gulf war, Jordan largely restored its relations with Western countries through its participation in the Middle East peace process and enforcement of UN sanctions against Iraq. Relations between Jordan and the Gulf countries improved substantially after King Hussein's death. Following the fall of the Iraqi regime, Jordan has played a pivotal role in supporting the restoration of stability and security to Iraq. The Government of Jordan signed a memorandum of understanding with the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq to facilitate the training of up to 30,000 Iraqi police cadets at a Jordanian facility.

Jordan signed a nonbelligerency agreement with Israel (the Washington Declaration) in Washington, D.C., on [[25 July]] [[1994]]. [[Hussein of Jordan|King Hussein]] and [[Yitzhak Rabin]] negotiated this treaty. [[Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace|Jordan and Israel signed a historic peace treaty]] on [[26 October]] [[1994]], witnessed by President [[Bill Clinton]], accompanied by U.S. Secretary, [[Warren Christopher]]. The U.S. has participated with Jordan and Israel in trilateral development discussions in which key issues have been water-sharing and security; cooperation on Jordan Rift Valley development; infrastructure projects; and trade, finance, and banking issues. Jordan also participates in the multilateral peace talks. Jordan belongs to the UN and several of its specialized and related agencies, including the World Trade Organization (WTO), the International Meteorological Organization (IMO), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and World Health Organization (WHO).

==Demographics==
[[Image:Jordan pop.png|right|thumb|400px|Graph showing the population of Jordan from 1960 to 2005.]]
{{main|Demographics of Jordan}}
Jordan has a population of 5.8 million. 95% of Jordan's population are Arabs, 40% of those are from Palestinian origins <ref>http://www.jordanembassyus.org/hmka05072002.htm</ref>, many of whom fled from Palestine to Transjordan and gained citizenship after the Arab-Israeli wars in 1948 and 1967.<ref>[http://www.columbiagazetteer.org/public/Jordan.html Jordan Demographics and Geography], Columbia Gazetteer</ref> the rest are mainly [[Circassian]]s, [[Chechen]]s, Armenians ([[Armenian diaspora|13th largest in the world]]) and [[Kurd]]s. Many Jordanians are also of Turkish and East European descent, as many Jordanian expatriates who reside in East European countries marry there.

The number of Lebanese permanently settling in Jordan since the [[2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict]] has not been established, and is estimated to be very little. According to Labour Ministry figures, the number of [[guest workers]] in the country now stands at 300,000, just over half of whom are [[Egyptians]].
Since the [[Iraq War]] many Christians ([[Assyrians]] and [[Chaldeans]]) from [[Iraq]] have settled permanently or temporarily in Jordan. 

Christians permanently residing in Jordan form approximately 6% of the population and have 20% of the seats in parliament.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} (reason for which is a good percentage of ex-pat communities of Jordanians abroad are Christian - original percentage should read 12%) Most Christians belong to the Greek Orthodox church (called "Room Urthudux" in Arabic). The rest are Roman Catholics (called "Lateen"), Eastern Catholics (called "Room Katoleek" to distinguish them from "Western Catholics"), and various Protestant communities including Baptists. Christians in Jordan are of many nationalities, as evinced, for example, by the Catholic mass being celebrated in Arabic, English, French, Italian, Spanish, Tagalog and Sinhala, as well as in Iraqi dialects of Arabic. However, Jordanian Christians are indigenous Arabs that share the Greater Culture of Jordan and the Broader East Mediterranean [[Levantine]] [[Arab]] Identity.

Other Jordanians belonging to Religious Minorities, Include adherents to the [[Druze]] and the [[Baha'i]] Faiths, which fall administratively under Islamic denomination, the [[Druze]] are mainly located in the Eastern [[Oasis]] Town of [[Azraq]] and the city of [[Zarka]], while the Village of Adassiyeh boardering [[The Jordan Valley]] is home to Jordan's [[Baha'i]] Community.  

The official language is [[Arabic language|Arabic]], but [[English language|English]] is used widely in commerce and government and among educated people. Arabic and English are obligatorily taught at public and private schools. [[French language|French]] is taught at some public and private schools but is not obligatory. However, a Vibrant and Emerging [[Francophone]] community has emerged in modern Jordan. [[Radio Jordan]] offers Official Radio Services in Arabic, English and French.

A portion of the people are registered as [[Palestinian refugees]] and displaced persons reside in Jordan, most as citizens. Since 2003 many Iraqis fleeing the [[Iraq War]] have settled in Jordan; latest estimates indicate between 700,000 and 1.7 million [[Refugees of Iraq|Iraqis]] living in Jordan;<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6293807.stm Doors closing on fleeing Iraqis]</ref> mainly in Amman, the capital.<ref>[http://hiidunia.blogspot.com/2007/01/new-iraqi-diaspora.html The New Iraqi Diaspora], Hii Dunia, January 2007</ref>

==Culture==
{{main|Culture of Jordan}}
The culture of Jordan, as in its spoken language, values, beliefs, ethnicities is Arab as the Kingdom is in the heart of the Middle East. Although many people from different regions of the world have come to settle in Jordan, like Circassians and Chechens, they have long been assimilated in the society and added their richness to the society that subsequently developed.

*[[Art in Jordan]]<br>Art in Jordan is plentiful, there are many local artists, as well as Arab, especially Iraqis, and those Arabs who live abroad frequently have exhibitions in different art galleries in the capital. In addition to an art museum in Jabal Luwiebdeh, there is Darat Al Funun, a very prestigious art center that frequently holds exhibitions by local, Arab and international artists. It is too in Jabal Luwiebdeh, but there are many other art centers that too hold exhibitions which suggests that art is a vibrant aspect of the capital

===Language===
Arabic is the official language of Jordan.  English is widely understood among most Jordanians, degrees vary upon educational levels and Demographical concentration. Middle and Upper Class Citizens tend to be Fluent and consider English as the [[Second Language]].  French is understood by mostly business entrepreneurs, government officials and University educators or graduates of The French Schools. [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and other [[Caucasian languages]] are understood and spoken by their respective populations residing in Jordan with minority schools teaching these languages, along side Arabic and English.

==Education==
{{main|Education in Jordan}}
Jordan has given great attention to education in particular. Its educational system is of international standards and its secondary education program is accepted in world-class universities.  Jordan now has the highest literacy rate in the Arab World and it is still growing. 

===School education===
{{seealso|Tawjihi|List of private schools in Jordan}}
School education in Jordan could be categorized into two sections:
*'''[[Secondary education]]''', which consists of two years of school study, for students who have completed the 10-year basic cycle. It comprises two major tracks:
:#'''Secondary education''', which can either be academic or [[vocational]]. At the end of the two-year period, students sit for the general secondary examination ([[Tawjihi]]) in the appropriate branch and those who pass are awarded the Tawjihi (General Secondary Education Certificate). The academic stream qualifies students for entrance to [[university|universities]], whereas the vocational or technical type qualifies for entrance to [[Community college]]s or universities or the [[job market]], provided they pass the two additional subjects.
:#'''Vocational secondary education''', which provides intensive vocational training and [[apprenticeship]], and leads to the award of a Certificate (''not'' the Tawjihi). This type of education is provided by the Vocational Training Corporation, under the control of the Ministry of Labour / Technical and Vocational Education and Training Higher Council.

====Foreign secondary education programs====
After completing the 8 or 10 years of basic education, Jordanians are free to choose any foreign secondary education program instead of the [[Tawjihi]] examinations (8 for IGCSE, 10 for SAT and IB). Such programs are usually offered by [[private school]]s. These programs include:
*[[IGCSE]]
*[[SAT]]
*[[International Baccalaureate]]
Private schools in Jordan also used to offer [[GCSE]] examinations, but they have now been replaced by IGCSE examinations.

Upon graduation, the ministry of Higher Education, through a system similar to that of the [[UK]] [[tariff]] points, transforms the Grades/Marks of these foreign educational programs, into the same marks used in grading Tawjihi students. This system is controversial, both as to the conversion process and the number of places allocated to non-Tawjihi applicants. 

Another source of trouble is the system used to transform exam results of foreign education programs into the Tawjihi scale, which is a percentage out of 100. Again, some see the system as fair and in fact over lenient with non-Tawjihi graduates, while others see it as unfair.

===Higher education===
{{seealso|List of universities in Jordan}}
Access to higher education is open to holders of the General Secondary Education Certificate who can then choose between [[privately owned|private]] community colleges, [[publicly owned|public]] community colleges or universities (public and private). The credit-hour system, which entitles students to select courses according to a study plan, is implemented at universities.  At present, there are eight public universities plus two newly-licensed ones, and thirteen private universities plus four newly-licensed ones. All post-secondary education is the responsibility of the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research. The Ministry includes the Higher Education Council and the Accreditation Council.

===Stages of studies===
====Non-university level post-secondary studies====
Non-university and vocational studies are offered in community colleges, access to which is open to holders of all types of general secondary education certificates. The two-to three-year programm encompasses many fields, such as Arts, Science, Management, Business Administration and Engineering.  As of 1997, all public Community Colleges are under the supervision of Al-Balqa Applied University. At the end of the two- or three-year course, students sit for a comprehensive examination (Al-Shamel). Those who pass are awarded the Associate Degree / Diploma.

====University level studies====
*First stage: [[Undergraduate]] level
The universities in Jordan follow the English-American education systems and are associated with many American and English universities. Bachelor's Degrees normally take four years. In Dentistry, Pharmacy and Engineering, studies last for five years. In  Medicine, they last for six years, followed by an Internship which lasts for one year. The Bachelor's Degree requires a total of 126-164 credit hours, depending on the field of study.

*Second stage: [[Postgraduate]] level
A [[Master's degree]] is awarded after a further one to two years' study following a Bachelor's Degree. It can be obtained either by course work and a thesis (c. 24 credit hours of courses and nine credit hours of research), or by course work (c. 33 credit hours) and a comprehensive examination. 

*Third stage: [[Doctorate]]
A Doctorate Degree is awarded after three to five years of further study and the submission of an original dissertation. It requires, depending on the subject, 24 credit hours of course work and 24 credit hours of research. 

*Teacher education: Training of pre-primary and primary/basic [[school teacher]]s
Basic school teachers must hold a Bachelor's Degree.
Training of secondary school teachers:
Secondary school teachers must hold a Bachelor's Degree and a one-year postgraduate Higher Diploma in Education.
Training of higher education teachers:
They must hold a Doctorate (PhD). In some cases a Master's Degree is sufficient.

*Non-traditional studies: Distance higher education
This type of education is offered at the newly-established branch of the Arab Open University.

====Lifelong higher education====
Lifelong education is offered at public and private universities, public and private community colleges, the Jordan Institute of Public Administration, The Jordan Geographic Center and The Royal Scientific Society, as well as in other institutions. Courses are offered in Engineering, Industry, Agriculture, Foreign Languages, Computer Sciences, Managerial Sciences, Secretarial Studies, Physical Education and subjects that can help the local community. Courses last between one week and six months at the end of which students obtain a Certificate of Attendance or Achievement. The qualifications needed depend on the subject and level of the course.  Some are designed for specific occupations, in which case a work experience in the relevant field is needed to attend such courses.
