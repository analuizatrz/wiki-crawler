[[Image:Bart King at Bat.jpg|right|thumb|[[Bart King]] is generally considered to be the best cricketer ever produced by the United States of America]]
The '''history of United States cricket''' begins in the [[eighteenth century]]. Among early Americans, [[cricket]] was as popular a bat and ball game as [[baseball]]. Though Americans generally never played cricket in great numbers, it did enjoy an initial period of sustained growth.<ref>Melville, Tom. ''Cricket for Americans: Playing and Understanding the Game''. (Bowling Green, Ohio: Bowling Green States University Popular Press, 1993), 73.</ref> Around the time of the [[United States Civil War]], the game began competing with baseball for participants, and cricket slowly declined in popularity. This was followed again by a brief [[golden age]] with the [[Philadelphian cricket team]]. This lasted until roughly the start of [[World War I]], at which time cricket again became less popular. In the latter part of the [[twentieth century]] immigrants from cricket playing nations in [[south Asia]] and the [[Caribbean|West Indies]] help spark a resurgence in the game's popularity. This led to participation and success in several [[International Cricket Council]] events. In 2007, the [[United States of America Cricket Association]] was suspended by the ICC because of problems with its administration.

==Early developments==
Cricket was being played in [[British North America]] by at least the beginning of the eighteenth century.<ref name='Smithsonian'>{{cite web | url=http://www.smithsonianmagazine.com/issues/2006/october/cricket.php | title = Cricket, Anyone? | accessdate=2007-03-30|last=Worrall |first=Simon |date=None Given |publisher=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian Institution Magazine]]}}</ref> The earliest definite reference to American cricket is in the 1709 diaries of [[William Byrd III|William Byrd]] of Westover on his [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] estates in [[Virginia]].<ref name='Byrd Diary'>Byrd, William. ''The Secret Diary of William Byrd of Westover''. (Richmond, Virginia: Dietz Publishing, 1941), 144, 146.</ref> By the time of the American Revolution, the game was so popular that the troops at [[Valley Forge]] participated in matches among themselves. There is at least one instance recorded of [[George Washington]] himself joining in a game of "wicket."<ref name='Ewing Journal'>Ewing, George. ''The Military Journal of George Ewing''. (New York: Privately Printed, 1928), 47.</ref> [[John Adams]] was recorded as saying in [[United States Congress|Congress]] that if leaders of simple cricket clubs could be called "presidents," there was no reason why the leader of the new nation could not be called something more grand.<ref>McCullough, David. ''John Adams''. (New York: Simon & Schuster, 2001), 405.</ref> Cricket continued to develop slowly as a recreational sport until the time of [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|American independence in 1783]].<ref name='Melville74'>Melville, Tom.

==History following independence==
[[Image:Harry Wright Baseball Card Cropped.jpg|left|thumb|[[Harry Wright]] helped to bring cricket strategies to America's national past time]]
Cricket enjoyed its greatest popularity along the east coast corridor between [[Philadelphia]] and [[New York]]. A contemporary report notes that upwards of 5,000 people played the game in those cities.<ref name='Kirsch'>Kirsch, George. "American Cricket: Players and Clubs Before the Civil War." ''Journal of Sports History'' (Spring 1984), 29.</ref> In 1833, students at [[Haverford College]] established what is generally accepted as the first cricket club exclusively for Americans. This club was short-lived, but helped to keep interest in the sport alive in Philadelphia leading to the foundation of the [[Philadelphia Cricket Club]] in 1854<ref name='Philly Club History'>{{cite web | url=http://www.philacricket.com/club/scripts/library/view_document.asp?NS=PUBLIC&DN=HIST | title = Philadelphia Cricket Club&nbsp;View Library Document: History | accessdate=2007-03-30|last=Murdoch |first=Joseph |date=None Given |publisher=[[Philadelphia Cricket Club]]}}</ref> and the [[Germantown Cricket Club|Germantown]] and [[Young America Cricket Club|Young America]] clubs in 1855.<ref name='Melville74'>Melville, Tom. ''Cricket for Americans: Playing and Understanding the Game''. (Bowling Green, Ohio: Bowling Green States University Popular Press, 1993), 74.</ref> By this time, Philadelphia had become the unofficial "Cricket Capital of America."

The United States holds the distinction of being a participant in the [[United States v Canada (1844)|first international cricket match]]. This match was first played against [[Canada cricket team|Canada]] on [[24 September]] [[1844]] at the [[St George's Cricket Club]] Ground in [[New York]].<ref name='DasCricInfoArticle'> {{cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/usa/content/story/141158.html|title=Cricinfo - Cricket in the USA|last=Das|first=Deb|accessdate=2007-03-09|date=None Given|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}</ref> The match was attended by some 10,000 spectators, and is today the world's oldest international sporting event.<ref name='CricClub'> {{cite web|url=http://cricketclub.org/can_usa.html |title=Canada Versus United States of America Cricket 1844 St George Cricket Club Ground, Manhattan, New York |accessdate=2007-03-09 |last= |first= |date=None Given |publisher=Cricket Club }}</ref> Wagers of around $120,000 were placed on the outcome of the match.

Sides from England toured North America (taking in both the USA and Canada) following the English cricket seasons of 1859, 1868 and 1872. These were organised as purely commercial ventures. The [[England cricket team in North America in 1859|1859 team]] comprised six players from the [[All-England Eleven]] and six from the United All-England Eleven and was captained by [[George Parr (cricketer)|George Parr]]. They played five matches, winning them all. There were no [[first-class cricket|first-class]] fixtures. The match at New York attracted a crowd that was claimed to be 10,000, all that the ground would hold.

Tne 1868 tourists were led by [[Edgar Willsher]] and those of 1872-3 by [[R.A. Fitzgerald]]. The latter side included [[W.G.Grace]]. 

Most of the matches of these early English touring teams were played "against odds", that is to say the home team was permitted to have more than eleven players (usually twenty-two) in order to make a more even contest.<ref>[[Alan Gibson]], ''The Cricket Captains of England'', The Pavilion Library, 1989, ISBN 1-85145-390-3, 4-7.</ref>

In spite of all this American growth in the game, it was slowly losing ground to a newcomer. In many cities, local cricket clubs were contributing to their own demise by encouraging crossover to the developing game of baseball. After the United States Civil War the [[Cincinnati Red Stockings|Cincinnati Red Stockings]] brought a talented young [[bowling (cricket)|bowler]] from the St. George's Cricket Club in New York to serve as a player and manager of the team. [[Harry Wright]] applied the "scientific" batting and specialized placement of fielders that he had learned in cricket to his new sport. This development was instrumental in creating the Cincinnati team's undefeated 1869 season. It also helped to secure the place of baseball as one of the most popular sports in the country.<ref name='Melville75'>Melville, Tom. ''Cricket for Americans: Playing and Understanding the Game''. (Bowling Green, Ohio: Bowling Green States University Popular Press, 1993), 75.</ref>

It may have been during the Civil War that baseball secured its place as America's game.<ref name='Melville75'>Melville, Tom. ''Cricket for Americans: Playing and Understanding the Game''. (Bowling Green, Ohio: Bowling Green States University Popular Press, 1993), 75.</ref> An army making a brief stop at a location could easily organise a game of baseball on almost any clear patch of ground, whilst cricket required a carefully prepared pitch. Baseball began to poach players and administrators from the world of cricket. [[Nicholas Young (executive)|Nick Young]], who served for 25 years as the president of the [[National League]], was originally a successful cricketer. It was not until the Civil War that he took up baseball because "it looked like cricket for which his soul thirsted."<ref>Irwin, Will. "Baseball Before the Professionals Came." ''[[Collier's Weekly]]''. (8 May 1909), 12-13.</ref> It has been suggested that the fast-paced quick play of baseball was more appealing to Americans than the technical slower game of cricket.<ref name='Melville75'>Melville, Tom. ''Cricket for Americans: Playing and Understanding the Game''. (Bowling Green, Ohio: Bowling Green States University Popular Press, 1993), 75.</ref> This natural tendency toward baseball was compounded by terrible American defeats at the hands of a traveling [[England national cricket team|English side]] in 1859, which made is seem that the Americans would never be successful at this English game.<ref>''Frank Leslie's Illustrated Weekly'' (5 October 1859).</ref> By the end of the Civil War, most cricket fans had given up their hopes of broad-based support for the game. Baseball filled the role of the "people's game" and cricket became an amateur game for gentlemen.<ref name='Melville75'>Melville, Tom. ''Cricket for Americans: Playing and Understanding the Game''. (Bowling Green, Ohio: Bowling Green States University Popular Press, 1993), 75.</ref><ref>Adelman, Melvin. ''A Sporting Time: New York City and the Rise of Modern Athletics, 1820-1870''. (Urbana, Illinois: University of Illinois Press, 1986).</ref>

==Rise of amateur cricket==
[[Image:Philadelphians in 1884.JPG|right|thumb|The [[Philadelphian cricket team]], shown here on an 1884 tour of England, were the premier American cricket team for several decades after the US Civil War]]
Following the Civil War, cricket grew into in amateur sport with much less broad appeal than it had had before. This manifestation can be seen in the foundation of the [[Staten Island Cricket and Baseball Club]]. The club was to be based on "the broadest and most liberal interpretation of the terms 'gentlemen' and amateur." They were not that interested in playing baseball, but in founding a more responsive club in the area than the St George's Cricket Club.<ref>Clay, Charles. "The Staten Island Cricket and Baseball Club." ''Outing''. (November 1887), 101-112.</ref> The members of the Seabright Lawn Tennis Club became so interested in cricket that they convinced club officials to sod their cricket ground with turf imported from England and had the name of the club changed to the [[Seabright Lawn Tennis and Cricket Club]] in 1885.<ref>Prentice, Bernon. ''History of the Seabright Lawn Tennis and Cricket Club''. (New Jersey: Privately Printed, 1937).</ref>

Nowhere was this new trend in cricket more evident than in Philadelphia. In 1865 a group of young people in that city founded the [[Merion Cricket Club]]. They were very emphatic about the purity of the sport and thwarted early attempts by some to convert the club into baseball club.<ref name='Melville76'>Melville, Tom. ''Cricket for Americans: Playing and Understanding the Game''. (Bowling Green, Ohio: Bowling Green States University Popular Press, 1993), 76.</ref> In the end, the club members passed a resolution that the remaining baseball equipment "be sold off as quickly as possible" to guarantee the purpose of the club.<ref>''The Merion Cricket Club, 1865-1965''. (Philadelphia: Merion Cricket Club, 1965).</ref> Following the lead of New York and Philadelphia, other cities saw new clubs form. These included [[St. Louis, Missouri|St Louis]], [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], and [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]].<ref name='Melville76-7'>Melville, Tom. ''Cricket for Americans: Playing and Understanding the Game''. (Bowling Green, Ohio: Bowling Green States University Popular Press, 1993), 76-77.</ref>

These decades also saw an increase in cricket-playing at the intercollegiate level. Following the Civil War, it looked like cricket might expand beyond its strongholds at Haverford College and the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. Members of these schools joined together with delegates from other collegiate cricket clubs, including [[Harvard University]], [[Columbia University]], and [[Princeton University]], to form the [[Intercollegiate Cricket Association]] in 1881.<ref>''The New York Times'' (27 April 1881), 8.</ref> The group was plagued by troubles and withdrawals. Other schools, such as [[Cornell University]], joined the ICA, but [[Yale University]] and [[Johns Hopkins University]] never got around to fielding a team. The ICA it lasted until 1924 when it crowned its last champion.<ref name='Melville77-8'>Melville, Tom. ''Cricket for Americans: Playing and Understanding the Game''. (Bowling Green, Ohio: Bowling Green States University Popular Press, 1993), 77-78.</ref><ref>Presbrey, Frank. ''Athletics at Princeton: A History''. (New York: Presbrey Company, 1901), 20-30, 557-561.</ref> These collegiate clubs generally drew their talent from pools at secondary schools which also fielded team and played in interscholastic competitions in this period.

===Philadelphian cricket===
{{main|Philadelphian cricket team}}
[[Image:George Stuart Patterson.jpg|left|thumb|[[George Stuart Patterson]] still holds the North American batting record with 271]]
The Philadelphian cricket team was a team that represented Philadelphia in [[first-class cricket]] between 1878 and 1913. The team was comprised of players from the four chief cricket clubs in Philadelphia&ndash;[[Germantown Cricket Club|Germantown]], [[Merion Cricket Club|Merion]], [[Belmont Cricket Club|Belmont]], and [[Philadelphia Cricket Club|Philadelphia]]. Players from smaller clubs, such as [[Tioga Cricket Club|Tioga]] and [[Moorestown Cricket Club|Moorestown]], and local colleges, such as Haverford, also played for the Philadelphians. Over its 35 years, the team played in 88 first-class cricket matches. Of those, 29 were won, 45 were lost, 13 were drawn and one game was abandoned before completion.<ref>A summary of the team's first-class matches can be found [[Philadelphian cricket team#Summary of first-class matches|here]].</ref> The "Gentlemen of Philadelphia" were able to win at least a match or two from all of the foreign sides that visited. They beat [[Australian national cricket team|Australia's]] test team by an innings on two separate occasions, in 1893 and 1896<ref name='Melville80'>Melville, Tom. ''Cricket for Americans: Playing and Understanding the Game''. (Bowling Green, Ohio: Bowling Green States University Popular Press, 1993), 80.</ref> Throughout their first-class period of play, the Philadelphians produced such cricketers as [[Bart King]], [[George Patterson (cricketer)|George Patterson]], and [[John Lester]].

The success of the team and of the sport itself in Philadelphia was the result of broad support from the citizens of the city.<ref name='Melville80'>Melville, Tom. ''Cricket for Americans: Playing and Understanding the Game''. (Bowling Green, Ohio: Bowling Green States University Popular Press, 1993), 80.</ref> Crowds of several thousand fans "ranging from millionaires, coaching parties, and box holders to newsboys" routinely filled the stands at the big four clubs during international matches.<ref>Pleasants, Henry. ''From Kitts to Pantaloons''. (West Chester, Pennsylvania: [[Temple University]], 1945), 145.</ref> These matches were also widely reported in local newspapers. Unlike the other regional pockets of cricket enthusiasm across the country, the sport maintained is popularity for almost two decades into the twentieth century.<ref name='Melville80'>Melville, Tom. ''Cricket for Americans: Playing and Understanding the Game''. (Bowling Green, Ohio: Bowling Green States University Popular Press, 1993), 80.</ref>

In 1897, the Gentlemen of Philadelphia were able to launch its first strictly first-class tour of England. This came about after many years of planning.This tour was a very ambitious one for the Americans. They had last toured the British Isles in 1889. Though the results may have been less satisfactory than hoped for by promoters, the tour was arranged mainly for educational purposes and few of those on the American side expected to win many matches.<ref name='Wis1898Sum'> {{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/150157.html |title=Wisden - 1898 - The Philadelphians in England, 1897 |accessdate=2007-01-31 |date=1898 |publisher=[[Wisden|John Wisden & Co]] }}</ref> The 1897 schedule included all of the top [[County Championship|county cricket]] teams, the [[Oxford University Cricket Club|Oxford]] and [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|Cambridge University teams]], the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]], and two other sides, though only a few of the counties thought it worth while to put their best elevens onto the field.<ref name='Wis1898Sum'> {{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/150157.html |title=Wisden - 1898 - The Philadelphians in England, 1898 |accessdate=2007-01-31 |date=1998 |publisher=[[Wisden|John Wisden & Co]] }}</ref> While it initially aroused some curiosity, many English fans lost interest until Bart King and the Philadelphians met the full [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]] team at Brighton on [[17 June]].

The Philadelphians again took King and his teammates to England in 1903. On this tour, the team rarely found itself outmatched. By the end of the tour, some English observers were comparing the Philadelphian team to some of the Australian sides that they had seen.<ref name='Melville82'>Melville, Tom. ''Cricket for Americans: Playing and Understanding the Game''. (Bowling Green, Ohio: Bowling Green States University Popular Press, 1993), 82.</ref> One of the highlights of the tour was the win over [[Gloucestershire Country Cricket Club|Gloucestershire]] by an innings and 26 runs.

(16 August 1903), 12.</ref> Unfortunately, this was followed by a relatively poor showing in 1908. The only bright spot of this tour was Bart King's capture of the season bowling record. His record of 11.01 was not bettered until 1958 when [[Les Jackson]] of [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club|Derbyshire]] posted an average of 10.99.<ref name='SABRUK'> {{cite web|url=http://www.sabruk.org/examiner/10/cricket.html |title=SABR UK Examiner no.10: Baseball and Cricket: Cross-Currents |accessdate=2007-01-31 |last=Synge |first=Allen |date=2007 |publisher=[[Society for American Baseball Research]] (UK Chapter) }}</ref>

==Decline of popularity==
[[Image:Belmont Cricket Club House.jpg|right|thumb|The Belmont Cricket Club was a casualty of cricket's decline in Philadelphia.  It was disbanded in 1914.]]
Even as the Philadelphians were faring poorly in England in 1908, a more disturbing trend was showing itself back home in Philadelphia.  The sport's grassroots popularity was waning.  Many Philadelphian professionals began to fill their leisure time with other activities such as [[golf]] and [[tennis]].  Starting around 1905, the number of matches held in the city dropped off.  Some of the great clubs of the city even began to close down due to lack of members.  Bart King's own Belmont Cricket Club sold its grounds and disbanded in 1914.  The sport slowly declined in Philadelphia and the last first-class match in the city was played in 1913.<ref name='Melville83'>Melville, Tom.  ''Cricket for Americans: Playing and Understanding the Game''. (Bowling Green, Ohio: Bowling Green States University Popular Press, 1993), 83.</ref> 

Another blow to cricket in the United States was the formation, in 1909, of the [[International Cricket Council|Imperial Cricket Conference]].  As the name implied, this was meant to be an organization for cricketing nations in the [[British Empire]].  Countries such as Australia and New Zealand were able to continue playing internationally, while the United States was left out.  Although commentator Robert Waller predicted that cricket "had taken so deep a root in Philadelphia that it could never be uprooted,"<ref>Wister, William. ''Some Reminiscences of Cricket in Philadelphia Before 1861''.  (Philadelphia, Allen Publishing, 1904), 142.</ref> the lack of support and international apathy caused an irreversible decline.<ref name='Melville84'>Melville, Tom. ''Cricket for Americans: Playing and Understanding the Game''. (Bowling Green, Ohio: Bowling Green States University Popular Press, 1993), 84.</ref>

==Slow resurgence==
In the second half of the twentieth century, immigrants to the United States from traditional cricket strongholds such as South Asia and the West Indies helped to stimulate the growth of the game. The first match televised in the United States was one between the Corinthians and [[Hollywood Cricket Club|Hollywood]] in 1958.<ref name='Marder and Cole'> {{cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/usa/content/story/261614.html |title=Cricinfo - Cricket in the USA |accessdate=2007-01-31 |last=Marder |first=John |coauthors=Adrian Cole |date=2007 |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] }}</ref> Cricket received a boost in the United States in 1959 when [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D.

== American-born Test cricketers ==
Although the United States is only an associate member of the ICC and has never played a [[Test cricket|Test]] match, three Test cricketers have been born in the USA.  [[Ken Weekes]] was born in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1912 and played in two of the Tests on the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies']] tour of [[England cricket team|England]] in 1939.  Weekes scored 137 at [[The Oval]] in the last Test match before the [[World War II|Second World War]].  Weekes eventually returned to the United States from [[Jamaica]], and died in [[Brooklyn]] in 1998.[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/53220.html] 

Later, the [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]-born [[Jehan Mubarak]] became an international Test player. He has played 8 Tests and 20 [[One Day International]]s for [[Sri Lanka cricket team|Sri Lanka]].[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/49633.html]

[[Clayton Lambert]], who played 5 Tests for the West Indies, reappeared for the USA in 2004 and played in the ICC trophy. [http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/usa/content/player/25635.html]

==Trivia==
*Ironically, as the United States was the first to host an international cricket match despite the sport's origins in the [[United Kingdom]], it was the UK that won the very first [[Baseball World Cup]] Tournament defeating the United States in a game that was invented in America and is the national pastime of the United States.
