==Plot summary==

On [[September 29]], [[2002]], exactly thirteen hours after the [[T-Virus]] [[outbreak]] in The Hive, which had occurred that same day,  the [[Umbrella Corporation]] sends in a research team to re-open the [[complex]]. The team enters The Hive through a secret insertion point beneath [[Raccoon City]]. Shortly after entering the [[research]] [[facility]], the entire team is then slaughtered by the T-Virus [[zombie]]s that had been sealed within the complex. With the entrance now open, Umbrella realizes, that before long, these highly infectious zombies will make their way to the surface and begin a full-scale [[outbreak]] on [[Raccoon City]].

Some four hours later, much of Raccoon City lies in devastation after the outbreak. Umbrella set a huge gate around the city to keep the zombies in the quarantine area. As civilians reached the local checkpoints around the city, Umbrella executives checked them for infection. Once the virus reached the gate, Major Timothy Cain ([[Thomas Kretschmann]]), Umbrella's security general, ordered all checkpoints closed for good, leaving no exceptions. All civilians must return to the city despite the odds, or Umbrella will shoot them on the spot. 

Meanwhile, [[Alice (Resident Evil)|Alice]] ([[Milla Jovovich]]) wakes up in a [[hospital]] in downtown, dazed. After surviving incident in The Hive, Alice was taken by Umbrella and used for experimentation. She was injected with [[T-virus]], and now had become [[superhuman]], with strength and dexterity. She exits the hospital and finds the streets in devastation. She finds transportation and heads towards a weapons surplus store. 

Elsewhere, [[Carlos Oliveira]] ([[Oded Fehr]]) and two other Umbrella soldiers link up with multiple [[Special Tactics And Rescue Service|S.T.A.R.S.]] units and attempt to hold against an onslaught of zombies in the street. There are too many zombies to handle and they are eventually over run. Carlos and his team fall back,even after one of them gets bitten and are seeking evacuation but realize they have been betrayed by Umbrella, left for dead in the infested city.

[[Jill Valentine]] ([[Sienna Guillory]]) (a Raccoon S.T.A.R.S. unit) and her friends fall to the Church, where they are attacked by [[Licker]]s, but saved by Alice, who was passing by. They join together and try to escape the city. 

Umbrella immediately sends their latest project, [[Nemesis (Resident Evil)|Nemesis]], formerly [[Matt Addison]], to kill all S.T.A.R.S. operatives. He encounters with [[L.J. (Resident Evil)|L.J.]] ([[Mike Epps]]), a cab driver, and 13 other cops. He kills every police officer, but spares L.J., because his directives were to kill the S.T.A.R.S., not civilians, not to mention his threat level readout placed the cab driver as zero threat.

[[Charles Ashford]], a key Umbrella scientist and creator of the T-virus, taps into Raccoon local cameras, and begins to look for his lost daughter, [[Angela Ashford|Angela]]. He finds Alice and asks her gang to look in her school, in exchange for a ride out. Soon, after their teammate was shot and Carlos was bitten, Carlos and the remains of his men are contacted and agree, heading toward the Junior School. He is able to save LJ and the two team up meeting Alice, Jill and Angela in the cafeteria and finding that he is the last man left of his team. The five of them are able to leave the school and Carlos says that he had been bitten and outside on the phone Dr. Ashford reveals the transport out.

As they drive, Alice explains the first movie and gives Carlos the antivirus thanks to Angela having it with her and Ashford states their escape vehicle is a high-jacked Umbrella Chopper. When they arrive, Major Cain captures them, executing Dr. Ashford and commanding Alice to face off against Nemesis. After a long fist fight with the antagonist, Alice wins by impaling Nemesis on a sharp peice of metal pertruding from the wall, and Nemesis remembers who he is and starts attacking Umbrella troops, thus freeing Alice. An action sequence then insues which results in Nemesis destroying an Umbrella helicopter and pushes Alice out of the way as it crashes downward, crushing and killing him. The group then escapes using the chopper and alice throws Cain Out of the helicopter after him saying "killing me won't put things right." Alice says "No, but its a start!" Cain vainly tries to save himself from the Zombies by shooting them then gives up and tries to shoot himself, then realising he has no bullets, the Zombies then eat him. Then, shortly before dawn, on [[September 30]], [[2002]], a [[thermonuclear]] warhead is launched and strikes the Raccoon [[City Hall]] destroying [[Raccoon City]] completely.

The chopper is hit by the shock wave, and thrashed into the Arklay Mountains. Inside Alice is impaled as she saves Angie from a loose part of the chopper. The others escape, and Umbrella arrives to take Alice to the Arklay Research Center. After the incident it is said in the news that Olivera and Vallentine have handed in the tape made by [[Terri Morales]] but even though they are believed for the time being, Umbrella finds a way to discredit them completely. Three weeks later, Alice is reborn using a new strain of the T-Virus, giving her new powers. She kills all the guards and escapes, as Valentine & Oliveira pick her up, to begin their hunt for Umbrella. The movie ends with Alice's eyes suddenly resembling the Umbrella logo. Umbrella begins the mysterious Alice Project, unbeknownst to Alice's compatriots.

<!-- Does Alice actually kill anybody after she is reborn? Looks like she just hits them and they remain alive  -->

==Production==
[[Image:Resident evil city hall.jpg|thumb|right|Filming at Toronto City Hall.]]

''Apocalypse'' was [[greenlit]] in [[2002]] when the first [[Resident Evil (film)|Resident Evil film]] was a success at the [[box office]]. The film was produced by Constantin Film, Davis Film and Impact Pictures, mostly on location in [[Canada]]. The film entered [[pre-production]] stages in mid [[2003]] and began [[principal photography]] on [[August 6]], [[2003]] and ended on [[October 23]], [[2003]]. 

The majority of the movie was filmed in Ontario, Canada; with [[Toronto]] and its surrounding suburbs being a stand-in for [[Racoon City]]. [[Toronto City Hall]] and [[Exhibition Place]] (namely the National Trade Centre) were used as Umbrella's worldwide headquarters, while the logos of [[Big Five (banks)|Canada's largest banks]] feature prominently in the skyline shots of the city, and the [[Prince Edward Viaduct]] is used to represent the only exit out of Racoon City. 

The movie cost $11 million more than the original ''Resident Evil'' 

[[Paul W.S. Anderson]], who wrote and directed the first ''Resident Evil'', only wrote the screenplay for ''Apocalypse'', passing the director's chair to [[Alexander Witt]] so he could direct ''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]''.

===The Monsters===
Previous to filming, just as in the first movie, actors playing zombies were trained at a zombie "[[boot camp]]." Actors were coached to act as zen-zombies (a creature that relentlessly follows its target) and ''liquid'' zombies. Anderson and other crew members were tempted to make the zombies move faster but decided that it would be breaking with a fundamental element of the games. 

[[Nemesis (Resident Evil)|Nemesis]] was an actor in a suit, [[Matthew G. Taylor]], with only special-effects applied to certain parts of the characters body (such as the eye of the creature). Despite Taylor being 1.98 metres (approx. 6 feet, 6 inches) in height he was still considered too short, to hide this the character wears large boots and in many scenes the Nemesis was stretched to appear taller.

The same dog-team was used for the zombie-dogs as in the first. The look of the [[Dobermann|dogs]] was achieved through a combination of make-up and computer-effects. Due to the dogs' inexplicable reluctance to dive through a sugar-glass window as they had done before, the window in the scene was done in CGI. 

The [[List of Resident Evil creatures#Licker|Lickers]] were fully computer-generated this time, though the use of physical puppets was considered for a while. To avert the problems faced during the production of the first film, the CGI work of the lickers began early in production.

=== Filming Locations ===
* [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]
* [[Brampton, Ontario|Brampton]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]
* [[Toronto City Hall|City Hall]], [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada
* [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], Ontario, Canada
* [[Hamilton Cemetery]], Hamilton, Ontario, Canada
* [[Prince Edward Viaduct]], Toronto, Ontario, Canada
* [[Bloor Collegiate Institute]], Toronto, Ontario, Canada
* [[Northern Secondary School]], Toronto, Ontario, Canada

===Regenerate===
[[Image:Resident2 02.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Regenerate.]]   
The ''Regenerate'' "commercial" was a teaser trailer for the second ''Resident Evil'' movie, and can be seen in the movie on a [[TV]] screen in the female scientist's house. It is reminiscent of the [[Olay]] product ''Regenerist'' advertisements.    

'''[[Regenerate (Resident Evil)|Regenerate]]''' ''(2003)'' is a skin care product (and registered trademark) of the Umbrella Corporation (motto: Our business is life itself), using the T-Virus to reanimate dead cells and make you more youthful looking. 

An ad similar to the Regenerate can be seen in ending credits. The ad states that the film is "a product of the Umbrella Corporation." It ends with "Some Side Effects may occur."

The [[teaser trailer]] is available from Sony Pictures in both RealMedia<ref>http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/residentevilapocalypse/video/trailer/trailer_low.ram</ref> and Windows Media formats.<ref>http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/residentevilapocalypse/video/trailer/trailer_low.asx</ref>

''Apocalypse'' received even more negative reactions from the critics than the first film. The film appears only 20% fresh on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] (22 out of 112 reviews are counted fresh).<ref name="Rotten Tomatoes">http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/resident_evil_apocalypse/</ref> Tim Cogshell from the ''Box Office Magazine'' stated that ''Apocalypse'' is ''"superior to the original film."'' Robert Dominguez, from ''[[New York Daily News]]'' stated that the film ''"should please the target audience."'' Walter Chaw from ''Film Freak Central'' states that ''Apocalypse'' is ''"An awful sequel to an awful film."''

Film critic Victoria Alexander (from FilmsInReview.com) said “If you like tough chicks killing zombies, RE:A is for you,” although she nonetheless noted that “Screenwriter Paul W.S. Anderson doesn’t bog down the film with philosophical subtext or explain the zombies,” which she acknowledges are probably not “questions ...suitable for the demographics targeted.”<ref name="Rotten Tomatoes">http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/resident_evil_apocalypse/</ref>

Critic Sean Axmaker gave the film a grade of C+, and said that the director’s “ headlong pace that favors action over spectacle... helps distract from all but the most contrived and absurd turns of Anderson's slapdash script.” Critic Dragan Antulovbigger gave the film 5/10. He noted the more spectacular setting (made possible by the bigger budget than the initial film), “deadlier weapons...[an] increased number of explosions[, and an] increased body count.” He said that despite the “shallowness of the content” there was “interesting production design and energetic direction.”<ref name="Rotten Tomatoes"/>

Reviewer Roger Ebert gave the film one half of a star, calling it an “utterly meaningless waste of time”, “a dead zone, a film without interest, wit, imagination or even entertaining violence and special effects.”  Chris Alexander of Rue Morgue Magazine said that “RE2 is a dreary, incoherent mess of a movie, failing on almost every conceivable level and having the dubious distinction of rendering hordes of shambling, screaming cannibalistic zombies boring.” Alexander stated that the director “Witt can’t stage an action sequence,” said that the lead actress “looks bored,” called the score “useless” and said that the “effects are more like defects.”<ref name="Rotten Tomatoes"/>

Film critic Rob Blackwelder called  "Resident Evil: Apocalypse" “inept, unoriginal, [and] asinine”, and stated that it is “on the Worst of 2004 list.” Blackwelder criticized the film as a
a “braindead disaster” with “pathetic... leaden mindlessness,” with “impossibly stupid and nonsensical plot defects.” He stated that the film was “overflowing with off-the-shelf action-hack staples” and “tiresome stereotypes,” and directed with a lack of “narrative or cinematic sense.”<ref name="Rotten Tomatoes"/>

Walter Chaw of Film Freak Central, who gave the film half a star out of four, criticized the “shoddiness of the make-up” and the lack of “critical biographical/geographical details.” He states that the editing seems like it was “edited with a weed whacker.” Chaw notes that “an entire sequence” was “lifted whole from La Femme Nikita.” While Chaw admits to loving genre films, he states that films like this “lowe[r] the conversation even lower than it already is.” In all, Chaw says “no artistry[–] it ain't good.” Reviewer Anthony Del Valle calls the film “yawn of the dead,” and laments “how little the writer develops the idea, and how the director turns his back on every opportunity to creatively exploit the situation.<ref name="Rotten Tomatoes"/>


===Box office===
The film grossed [[United States dollar|$]]23,036,273 on its opening weekend ([[September 10]]-[[September 12|12]] [[2004]]). The film gained $51,201,453 domestically and $129,394,835  worldwide.<ref name="boxofficemojo"/> 

The film's success has spawned one sequel, currently in production titled ''[[Resident Evil: Extinction|Extinction]]'', the official web-site of which claims it will be the last film in the series, although a fourth film was initially rumoured.

==Trivia==
* The film's director [[Alexander Witt]] has a cameo in the film as the sniper on top of Raccoon City Hall.
*[[Ben Moody]], former lead guitarist of the alternative rock band [[Evanescence]], makes a brief cameo appearance as a zombie in the film, which is mentioned in the DVD audio commentary.  
*The word "zombie" is never mentioned, following the example of the first movie.
*Dr. Charles Ashford and his daughter Angela share the same last names as the Ashfords, one of the families who were revealed as having founded Umbrella and the last two scions of which were the primary antagonists in [[Resident Evil: Code Veronica]].
*Major Cain was attacked by the zombie of Dr. Ashford, yet he had killed Dr. Ashford before hand with a shot to the stomach
*The S.T.A.R.S team that was killed in the store by Nemesis is said to be of the director's family.
*The way Raccoon City was destroyed is similar to the way Jackson City is destroyed in Return of the Living Dead

==Game connections==

[[Image:Arklaymountainsfromapocalypse.jpg|thumb|350px|The [[Arklay Mountains]] overlooking [[Raccoon City]].]]
====Introduction Scenes====
* ''Apocalypse'' re-enacts certain scenes from the games (particularly the intro scenes):
:* The car crash scene that leaves Angela Ashford stuck in Raccoon City is reminiscent to the intro of ''Resident Evil 2'' , which forces [[Leon S. Kennedy]] and [[Claire Redfield]] to separate on their way to the police station.
:* The scene where Alice runs through the building with an Umbrella helicopter firing at her, up to the point where she drops her gun, falls, re-grabs it and fires, is reminiscent to the intro scene of ''[[Resident Evil Code: Veronica]]'' in which [[Claire Redfield]] does the same thing.
:* The scene in which [[Raccoon City]] is being overrun by zombies, and the police and [[Umbrella Corporation|Umbrella]] mercenaries are fighting back, up to the point in which a zombie reflects off a fallen police helmet, is reminiscent to the intro scene of ''Resident Evil 3: Nemesis.'' The launching of the missile to complete sanitation is also a scene similar to that of one in the game.

====Resident Evil====
* The crash site of the helicopter is located in the [[Arklay Mountains|Arklay Forest]] near the Arklay Mountains, where the ''[[Resident Evil (series)|Resident Evil]]'' series first began.
* In the abandoned church and school, Jill moves and points the gun the exact same way she does in the game.
* Terri's death is similar to Joseph's death (''RE1'' remake) which is also recorded, though the latter was mauled by the zombie dogs, not children.
* A white goddess statue can be seen in the church. Artwork of goddesses has a large role within the puzzles in the ''Resident Evil'' series.
*On the ''Arklay Overpass'', Jill speculates that there is no way out, and that Ashford may just be watching them on the cameras, as if the whole thing were some sort of sick game. ''Resident Evil: Apocalypse'' is, of course, an adaptation of a series of games and the fixed camera perspective in most of the earlier games resembles a mounted camera's perspective.

====Resident Evil 2====
* Alice's visit to the gun shop at the start of ''Apocalypse'' is a reference to ''Resident Evil 2'', where one of the leading characters takes shelter in a gun shop.
* The character Angela Ashford may be a concept borrowed from [[Sherry Birkin]], as they are both children, dressed in school uniforms, in need of rescue. Both of their fathers are also researchers working for Umbrella. The Ashford name, however, comes from the founders of Umbrella revealed in ''Resident Evil : Code Veronica''.

====Resident Evil 3: Nemesis====
* Jill wears the same outfit from ''[[Resident Evil 3: Nemesis]]''.
* Like his video game counterpart, Nemesis only speaks one word ("S.T.A.R.S."). Unlike his video game counterpart, he only speaks this line once whereas in the game, Nemesis speaks this line constantly during every encounter.
* The graveyard scene is a reference to the ''Resident Evil Remake'', ''Resident Evil 3: Nemesis'', and ''Resident Evil Code: Veronica'', where zombies also pop out of their graves.
* The scene in which a zombie's head is reflected in a Raccoon City Police Department Motorcycle helmet, is a reference to a similar scene in the game's opening cut scene.
* The nuclear weapon approach and explosion is a shot-for-shot recreation of the equivalent scene in the videogame's finale.

==Game and Movie Differences==

{| class="wikitable" width="100%"
|- bgcolor="#CCCCCC"
! Movie !! Games
|- 
| Jill was suspended from [[S.T.A.R.S.]] after events unknown. They are never explained. In the novelization Jill was suspended due to her report on zombies in the forest, but this is not canon.
| Jill resigns from S.T.A.R.S. after all attempts to expose the events at the mansion are ignored or blocked by [[Raccoon Police Department|R.P.D.]] Chief Brian Irons (who subsequently disbanded the unit), on [[William Birkin]]'s payroll. She resigns to investigate [[Umbrella Corporation|Umbrella]]'s doings in [[Raccoon City]] full time.
|- 
| [[Raccoon City]] is nuked by Umbrella in an effort to cover up the outbreak. With [[Umbrella Corporation|Umbrella]]'s marketing and economic muscle, they are able to manipulate the media into reporting it as an incident at the nuclear plant.
|The [[Federal government of the United States|US government]] orders a nuclear missile strike on Raccoon City after a group of Tyrants defeated elements of the armed forces in a battle near an abandoned factory on the outskirts of the town (the aftermath of this battle can be seen in ''Resident Evil 3''). Despite the political maneuvering of Umbrella, who wanted to study the effects of the city-wide infection, the strike is initiated. Later on in ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'', it is known that the US government suspended the activities of Umbrella.
|-
|The [[T-Virus]] can be used for medical applications. It helped Angie to walk.
|In the games the virus is said to regenerate body cells, but it is unknown whether it works correctly to all body cells and can actually create a 'cure' for (muscle) disease, and if it can be controlled by an anti-virus. The only proven application of the T-Virus is to create bioweapons. 
|-
|Lickers are created by injecting the T-Virus directly into living tissue. When they taste fresh blood, they mutate.
|Lickers are created when people infected by the T-Virus are exposed to a second dose. These creatures are accidental and were created due to the circumstances of the outbreak. They do not mutate after tasting blood.
|-
|[[Nemesis (Resident Evil)|Nemesis]] is killed after defending Alice from gunfire. It might be possible that the damage it received wasn't bad enough to make it mutate, but this is only a suggestion from the game. Though it's  mutations from [[Nemesis (Resident Evil)|Nemesis]] didn't really show.

|Nemesis is killed after being dodged by Jill for a majority of the outbreak. After a series of battles, the Nemesis is reduced to a nebulous blob finally put to rest by two shots from the "Paracelsus Sword" weapon, a fixed magnetic coil gun brought in by US armed forces to fight off a squad of Tyrants.
|-
|Nemesis does not have tentacles, but does have a Gatling Gun and Rocket Launcher.
|Nemesis uses his T- infected tentacles (Actually the 'roots' of the Nemesis-parasite coming out through the host's body) to attack enemies as well as a Rocket Launcher. S.T.A.R.S. member [[Brad Vickers]] was killed with his tentacles, and later resumed animation as a zombie (only to be killed by either [[Leon S. Kennedy]] or [[Claire Redfield]]).
|-
|The outbreak in Raccoon occurred as a result of Umbrella researchers re-opening the Hive. The city is infected within hours.
|The outbreak occurs as a combination of monsters left over from the mansion incident and an assassination attempt on William Birkin for his G-Virus sample. As the assassin escaped with his work, Birkin injects himself with the G-Virus and wreaks havoc. In the process, the T-Virus is spilled and the rodent population in the sewer are infected, slowly spreading the virus to the citizens. The city is infected in less than a week.
|-
|The T-Virus is said to cause uncontrolled mutation.
|The G-Virus is the only virus that mutates uncontrollably and it cannot be passed by bites, but according to Anette Birkin (William Birkin's wife) "it is able to revitalize cellular functions". It requires direct inoculation or embryos implanted on a genetically compatible host. However in ''Resident Evil 2'' the T-Virus is described as "a mutagenic toxin", and even though most of its victims turn into zombies, other creatures such as the lickers, the Tyrant and (possibly) Nemesis, giant spiders, mutated sharks, and oversized lampreys are products of infection. No positive effects of the T-virus have been observed in the games.
|-
|The Umbrella Corporation publicly flaunts their wealth and power. They funded the construction of Raccoon City and have great power worldwide.
|The Umbrella Corporation is a powerful company, yet they deal mostly in secret. Though their contributions have led to the development of Raccoon City, they do not flaunt their international power openly. To the public, they're known as a simple medical/health corporation, akin to [[Pfizer]].
|-
|Nemesis was created as part of the "Nemesis Program", a project to create the ultimate bioweapon. It was created in [[the USA|America]]. It was unleashed by Umbrella within Raccoon City to test its abilities such as wiping out S.T.A.R.S.
|The Nemesis was an experimental bio-weapon created by the European branch by implanting a new kind of parasitic  organism into an ordinary mass-produced [[Tyrant (Resident Evil)|Tyrant]]. In the first game it is revealed that the real reason for S.T.A.R.S involvement in the mansion incident was Albert Wesker's intention to test the bioweapons against "realistic targets" (armed, trained paramilitaries/military personnel). Nemesis takes time to train and perfect, since they are programmed to hunt specific targets. In ''Resident Evil 3'', its mission was to hunt down and kill the remaining S.T.A.R.S. due to their involvement in the "Mansion Incident."
|-
|Alice is forced to battle the [[Nemesis (Resident Evil)|Nemesis]] as a final "test" by [[Major Timothy Cain]] to determine which bioweapon is the most powerful.  This takes place before the Nemesis' death while trying to save Alice and the survivors after decidingly revolting against his creators.
|[[Jill Valentine]] is forced to defeat the [[Nemesis (Resident Evil)|Nemesis]], now a gelatinous blob of organs, as it is preventing her to escape the factory towards the finale of the game.  After being severely weakened by the "Paracelsus Sword" rail gun, Jill empties her Magnum into it, finishing it off completely.
|-
|Jill, [[Carlos Oliveira|Carlos]], Angie, and L.J. free Alice from Umbrella headquarters after the Raccoon City nuking.
|Jill and Carlos escape from Raccoon (with or without [[Barry Burton|Barry]]'s help, depending on the ending). Where they head is unknown, but it seems they still intend to meet up with [[Chris Redfield]] in [[Europe]].
|-
|Nicholai was a heroic, somewhat naive mercenary, eventually killed by two [[zombie]] dogs in the movie.
|[[Nicholai Ginovaef|Nicholai]] is a double-crossing, secret Umbrella agent, who is either killed by Nemesis, escapes in a helicopter or is shot down in a helicopter by Jill depending on the player's choices throughout the game. 
|-
|Nemesis is computer-controlled and can be programmed with commands remotely from a laptop.
|Nemesis is autonomous, and follows his pre-set commands to wipe out S.T.A.R.S.
|-
|[[Carlos Oliveira|Carlos]]' uniform shows his last name spelled "Olivera."
|[[Carlos Oliveira|Carlos]]' last name is Oliveira.
|-
|The S.T.A.R.S. team consists of at least 25 operatives during the Raccoon City incident. Members include [[Jill Valentine]], Peyton Wells, Commander Ryan Henderson and other unnamed characters. [[Chris Redfield|Chris]] and [[Barry Burton|Barry]] (and other character from the games besides Jill) are nowhere to be seen.
|The S.T.A.R.S. team first consists of 11 members (excluding pilot Kevin Dooley), divided into two separate teams which were [[S.T.A.R.S.#Alpha Team|Alpha]] and [[S.T.A.R.S.#Bravo Team|Bravo]]. During their [[investigation]]s of the Mansion incident, most of the team was killed off and reduced to 5 members when they escaped (without taking [[Albert Wesker|Wesker's]] revival into account). During the events of ''Resident Evil 3'', however, Brad Vickers, the pilot of Alpha Team, is killed by Nemesis in front of the R.P.D. Precinct.  S.T.A.R.S. was disbanded by Chief Irons after the Arklay Mountain incident and the armed elite officers fighting the zombies were actually members of the newly created [[Raccoon Police Department#Select Police Force|Select Police Force]].

== Soundtrack ==
There are two albums for Resident Evil: Apocalypse. The first is the [[Resident Evil: Apocalypse (soundtrack)|soundtrack]], featuring music from and inspired by the movie. The second is the [[Resident Evil: Apocalypse (score)|score]], composed by [[Jeff Danna]] and performed by the [[Philharmonia Orchestra]]. The Score album features at least 2 tracks that were not featured in the film, notably "2 Wheels Hero" (possibly in reference to Alice's arrival in the church on a motorbike). This track is loud, part of it can be heard in a fan made trailer for "Resident Evil: Extinction" on YouTube.

==DVD== 
[[Image:ResidentEvilApocalypseRegion2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|UK DVD cover]]
The ''Resident Evil: Apocalypse'' [[DVD]] was released on [[December 28]], [[2004]] in [[North America]] and [[March 16]], [[2005]] in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. 

The [[United Kingdom|UK]] region 2 DVD was released in February [[2005]]. The release, whilst only having one disc, was almost exactly the identical to the North American release. The region 2 version features descriptive commentary for the blind. The cover also features Alice, like on the R1 DVD cover, but it in a gray-blue and black, with Alice in a graveyard with Raccoon City in ruins in the background.

=== Region 2 Special Edition === 
Play.com lists a 2 disc special edition of Resident Evil: Apocalypse that features new packaging art. The DVD will be released in early September, probably to coincide with the release of Resident Evil: Extinction.

==Extended Edition ==
The film's DVD release in [[Germany]] has an exclusive "Extended Edition", that reinstates most of the Deleted Scenes from the DVD and also, but not limited to. 

=== Extended Scenes===
* An extended scene before Jill, Peyton and Terri enter the church, Terri whispers to Jill "What's going on? They were shooting on people. Innocent people, why didn't you do something? You are the police aren't you?" Jill ignores her, the scene continues as normal, but audio is a bit different in places.

* A shot that was in the trailer where the camera spins around a gargoyle on top of the church, and a flash of lightning reveals a Licker, thrashing its tongue around.

* A shot of Alice pulling a shard of glass out of her leg after Jill demands "Who the fuck are you?" and limping away.

* After L.J. runs over the undead, he sees 2 topless strippers, and crashes his car. In the Extended Version, L.J. says something along the lines of "You're still looking good, baby. I'll still spend 5 dollars on you!" before crashing. This scene was in the [[novelization]] by [[Keith R.A. DeCandido]].

* After L.J. drops his guns before the Nemesis, he shouts abuse at him and dances whilst clicking his fingers and singing. Some of these shots are in the outtakes reel. 

* Finally, an exchange between Jill and Alice when they are walking past the phone boxes, where Alice asks "What are you staring at?" Jill responds "I'm not sure, what made you want to work for Umbrella?" from a wide angle, Alice says "A girl's gotta make a living." Jill laughs.  This scene is featured in the deleted scenes for the U.S. version of the DVD.
