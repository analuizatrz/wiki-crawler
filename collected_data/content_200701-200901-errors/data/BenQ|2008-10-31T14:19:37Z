'''BenQ Corporation''' ({{pronEng|ˌbɛn ˈkjuː}}; {{lang-zh|明基電通股份有限公司}})  is a Taiwanese company that sells and markets consumer electronics, computing and communications devices under the "BenQ" brand name.

== Name ==

The company was established in 1984, initially known as Acer Peripherals Inc., then Acer CM (Communications and Multimedia)  however it had no relationship with [[Acer Inc.|Acer computers]]. It was  finally renamed to BenQ Corp to avoid confusion with Acer Computer, and launched the "BenQ" brand in December 2001. BenQ Corporation is one of the companies within the BenQ Group, which also includes [[AU Optronics]].

The name reflects their corporate vision: '''B'''ringing '''E'''njoyment a'''N'''d '''Q'''uality to life. 

In September 2007, the company completed the separation of branded and ODM business: New legal entity BenQ Corporation was established to take over the assets and liabilities of the branded business while the original legal entity was renamed "[[Qisda]] Corporation," which comprises BenQ’s manufacturing business.



There are no computers (desktop or laptop or notebook) carrying Acer Peripherals or Acer CM labels.
Any computer labelled as Acer was made by Acer Computers.

== Company ==

BenQ sells and markets technology products, including consumer electronics, computing and communication products. Its principal products include [[TFT LCD]] monitors and televisions, digital projectors, [[laptop]]s, digital cameras, [[computer keyboard]]s, [[mouse (computing)|mice]], [[optical drive]]s and [[mobile phone]]s.

The head office is located in [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]], and the company operates worldwide. BenQ owns and operates five branch offices in Asia Pacific, China, Europe and the Americas, and employ over 2,000+ individuals.  The "BenQ" brand is present in more than 100 countries worldwide.

== Recent developments ==

On [[October 1]], [[2005]], BenQ acquired the mobile devices division of [[Germany]]'s [[Siemens AG]], becoming the 6th largest company in the mobile phone industry by accumulated market share.  The acquisition results in a new business group, [[BenQ Mobile]], of BenQ Corporation entirely dedicated to wireless communications. Mobile phones of the new group are marketed under a new brand, BenQ-Siemens.

On [[August 24]], [[2006]] BenQ announced plans to spin-off its manufacturing operations in early 2007, separating contract manufacturing and own-brand divisions.      

In late September 2006, the mobile devices division of BenQ, BenQ Mobile ([[Germany]]), announced bankruptcy when BenQ Corp. discontinued its funding.  As a result, BenQ Mobile was effectively placed under the supervision of a state-appointed bankruptcy administrator.   In February 2007, BenQ Mobile was finally disbanded as a suitable buyer could not be found.  An estimated 2000 BenQ Mobile employees lost their jobs. 

In April 2007, considering that the branded business has achieved sufficient profit and scale to sustain and grow its operation independently, BenQ announced the plan to spin-off its branded business. After the spin-off, BenQ Corporation will be renamed Qisda Corporation, which will focus on integrated manufacturing service business, and the spun-off company has succeeded the name of BenQ Corporation, which is a 100% owned subsidiary of Qisda Corp. 

On Sept. 3 2007, the newly spun-off BenQ Corporation has commenced its new operation to continue selling and marketing products under the BenQ brand name.
