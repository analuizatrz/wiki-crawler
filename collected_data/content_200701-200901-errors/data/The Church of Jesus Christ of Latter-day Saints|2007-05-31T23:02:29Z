'''The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints''', widely known as the '''LDS Church''' or the '''Mormon Church''', is the largest and most well-known [[Religious denomination|denomination]] originating from the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] (a group of [[church]]es and adherents who follow the teachings of [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]]). The church is headquartered in [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]] and has established churches and [[temple (Latter Day Saints)|temples]] worldwide, self-reporting nearly 13 million members on its rolls.<ref name="currentmembership">[http://www.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=d10511154963d010VgnVCM1000004e94610aRCRD Statistical Information], Retrieved May 2, 2007</ref>

Adherents to the church (usually called ''[[Mormon]]s'', ''Latter-day Saints'' or ''LDS'') believe that [[Jesus]] leads their church via [[revelation]] given to the [[President of the Church (Latter Day Saints)|President of the Church]], whom they consider to be a [[prophet]]. They count themselves as [[Christian]]s, but do not consider themselves part of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]], or [[Protestantism|Protestant]] traditions. Instead, they believe that the church is a [[restoration (Latter Day Saints)|restoration]] of [[1st century]] [[Christianity]]. They believe in the divine authority of the [[Old Testament]] and [[New Testament]], but have additional [[book]]s in their [[Biblical canon|scriptural canon]]: the ''[[Book of Mormon]]'', the ''[[Doctrine and Covenants]]'', and the ''[[Pearl of Great Price (Latter Day Saints)|Pearl of Great Price]]''.

Historically, the church has distinguished itself from traditional Christian denominations by its practice of [[plural marriage|polygamy]] (discontinued beginning in 1890) and by its other unique [[doctrine]]s and practices such as the [[Endowment (Latter Day Saints)|Endowment]], [[baptism for the dead]], and its views on the [[Godhead (Latter Day Saints)|Godhead]]. The church teaches that it is "the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth",<ref>{{lds|D&C|dc|1|30}}</ref> but it has cooperated with other religious organizations in promoting humanitarian and moral causes.

{{main|History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the largest church that claims to be a continuation of the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]], founded by [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] on [[April 6]] [[1830]] in either the [[Manchester (town), New York|Manchester]]–[[Palmyra (town), New York|Palmyra]] area or [[Fayette, New York]].<!--

FOOTNOTE--><ref>The majority of witnesses say the church was organized [[April 6]] [[1830]] in the log home of Joseph Smith, Sr. in the [[Manchester (town), New York|Manchester]] area, followed by a meeting the next Sunday in nearby [[Fayette, New York|Fayette]] at the home of [[Peter Whitmer, Sr.]] Nevertheless, one of Smith's histories and a later reminiscence by [[David Whitmer]] say the church was organized at the Whitmer home in Fayette. See [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)]]. The Church refers to Fayette as the place of organization in all its official [[publication]]s.</ref><!--

--> Joseph Smith established this early church soon after publishing the ''[[Book of Mormon]]''. The church rapidly gained a large following who viewed Smith as a [[prophet]].  The rapid growth of Smith's following was attributed by some to the convincing power of the Book of Mormon, which Smith said that he translated from a book of [[golden plates]], buried near his home in a place shown him by [[Moroni (prophet)|an angel]].<ref name="JSTestimony">[http://lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.b12f9d18fae655bb69095bd3e44916a0/?vgnextoid=2354fccf2b7db010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&locale=0&sourceId=69f9307e3584b010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&hideNav=1 Joseph Smith's Testimony]</ref>

In late 1830, Smith envisioned a [[Zion (Latter Day Saints)|"city of Zion"]] in [[Native Americans|Native American]] lands near [[Independence, Missouri]]. In October 1830 he sent his second-in-command [[Oliver Cowdery]] and others on a [[mission]] to the area.<ref>{{lds|D&C|dc|32}}</ref> Passing through [[Kirtland, Ohio]], the missionaries converted a congregation of [[Disciples of Christ]] led by [[Sidney Rigdon]], and in 1831, Smith decided to temporarily move his followers to Kirtland until the [[Missouri]] area could be colonized. The church headquarters remained in Kirtland from 1831 to 1838; meanwhile, the church built [[Kirtland Temple|its first temple]] and grew in size.

On [[July 20]], [[1831]] Smith circulated a written revelation that [[Independence, Missouri]] was to be the center place for the city of Zion.<ref>{{lds|D&C|dc|57|1-3}}</ref> Though many of Smith's followers attempted to colonize Missouri throughout the 1830s, and Smith himself moved there in 1838, the church faced political and military opposition by other Missouri settlers. After a series of raids on Mormon settlements, the church formed its own militia and the [[Mormon War]] of 1838 ensued, culminating in the religion being expelled from the state under an [[Extermination Order]] signed by [[Lilburn W. Boggs|the governor of Missouri]]. The church then established its new headquarters in [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], a city they built on drained swampland by the [[Mississippi River]], where Joseph Smith Jr. served as mayor. There, the church built a [[Nauvoo Temple|new temple]], and thrived until Smith and his brother Hyrum, whom most agree would have been Joseph's successor, were [[death of Joseph Smith, Jr.|killed by a mob]] in 1844. They were awaiting trial for their decision to destroy a [[Nauvoo Expositor|local newspaper]] that said Smith was practicing a form of [[polygamy]] and that he intended to establish himself as a theocratic king. Joseph Smith Jr., at the time, was a minor candidate for [[President of the United States]].

After Joseph and Hyrum's death, some church leaders campaigned to lead the church during a time known as the [[Succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)|Succession Crisis]]. The majority of adherents voted to accept the succession claims presented by the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]], led by [[Brigham Young]]. After continued difficulties in Illinois, Brigham Young left Nauvoo in 1846, and led his followers (called the [[Mormon pioneers]] during this period) to what later became [[Utah]] (then part of [[Mexico]]), and began to colonize the area with numerous small cities.

In Utah, Young incorporated The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as a legal entity under the laws of the [[Territory of Utah]]. He initially governed his followers as a [[theocracy|theocratic]] leader, and openly encouraged the practice of [[plural marriage]], which Joseph Smith had tried to keep secret. When word of the practice got back to [[Washington, D.C.]], the United States sent federal troops there in 1857, [[Utah War|deposed Young]], and replaced him with [[Alfred Cumming (governor)|a non-Mormon territorial governor]], though Young still wielded significant political power as [[President of the Church (Latter Day Saints)|President of the Church]]. Young was followed by other powerful leaders, who were defiant in the face of U.S. efforts to outlaw polygamous marriages in the territory. Political and legal wrangling over the polygamy issue escalated until 1890, when church president [[Wilford Woodruff]] issued a [[1890 Manifesto|Manifesto]] officially suspending the practice.<ref>{{lds|Official Declaration —|od|1}}</ref> Church relations with the United States markedly improved after 1890, and especially after 1904, when church president [[Joseph F. Smith]] [[Reed Smoot hearings|disavowed polygamy]] before the [[United States Congress]] and issued a "Second Manifesto" calling for all polygamous marriages in the church to cease. Since about the 1930s, the church has adopted a policy of [[excommunication|excommunicating]] its members found practicing polygamy.

During the [[20th century]], the church experienced a period of exponential growth, due to a high birth rate and extensive [[proselytism]].{{Fact|date=May 2007}} In 1978, after years of internal discussion within the church hierarchy, the church ended its longtime practices of [[Blacks and Mormonism|not allowing blacks to hold the priesthood]] and prohibiting their participation in temple ceremonies thought necessary for the highest degree of salvation. Since the 1990s, the church's growth rate has no longer been exponential, but the church continues to gain about 300,000 new members per year.{{Fact|date=May 2007}} 

===Historical positions on moral and political issues===
The church has played a prominent role in political matters, including opposition to the repeal of [[Prohibition in the United States]],{{Fact|date=May 2007}} opposition to [[LGM-118A Peacekeeper|MX (Peacekeeper) missile]] bases in Utah and Nevada,<ref>“[http://www.lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.b12f9d18fae655bb69095bd3e44916a0/?vgnextoid=2354fccf2b7db010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&locale=0&sourceId=b0d6fc3157a6b010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&hideNav=1 First Presidency Statement on Basing of MX Missile]”, ''Ensign'', June 1981, 76.</ref> opposing the [[Equal Rights Amendment]],<ref>[http://www.lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.b12f9d18fae655bb69095bd3e44916a0/?vgnextoid=2354fccf2b7db010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&locale=0&sourceId=f8a4615b01a6b010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&hideNav=1 “The Church and the Proposed Equal Rights Amendment: A Moral Issue”], ''Ensign'', Mar. 1980, insert.</ref> opposing legalized [[gambling]],<ref>[http://www.lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.b12f9d18fae655bb69095bd3e44916a0/?vgnextoid=2354fccf2b7db010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&locale=0&sourceId=4ace94bf3938b010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&hideNav=1 “Church’s Stand against Gambling]”, ''Ensign'', Mar. 1992, 74.</ref> support of bans on [[same-sex marriage]],<!--

== Sacred texts and other publications ==
[[Image:Latter-day Saint Scripture Quadruple Combination.jpg|right|thumb|150px|The [[Standard Works]] of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints printed in the ''Quadruple Combination'' format]]

{{main|Standard Works}}

The church's [[biblical canon|canon]] of sacred texts consists of the ''[[Bible]]'', the ''[[Book of Mormon]]'', the ''[[Doctrine and Covenants]]'' and the ''[[Pearl of Great Price (Latter Day Saints)|Pearl of Great Price]].'' These are referred to as the church's ''[[Standard Works]]''. Though not canonical, many members of the church also accept the teachings and pronouncements of the church's [[general authority|general authorities]], and particularly the [[President of the Church (Latter Day Saints)|President of the Church]], as scripture, and even as taking precedence over the Standard Works.<ref>Ezra Taft Benson (Feb. 26, 1980), "Fourteen Fundamentals of Following the Prophet", BYU Devotional (arguing that "the living prophet is more vital to us than the Standard Works").</ref>

The church's most significant scripture, the ''[[Book of Mormon]]'', was published by founder [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] in 1830, and is a story about various groups of [[pre-Columbian]] [[Christianity|Christians]], which Smith said he translated from [[golden plates]] buried near his home. The church teaches that the book is an actual history of the principal [[ancestors]] of the [[Native American]] peoples, though no indisputable [[archaeology and the Book of Mormon|archaeological evidence]] has yet been found.

The church's acceptance of the ''[[Bible]]'' as the word of [[God]] comes with the proviso that the church teaches that it was not always translated correctly from the original [[manuscript]]s.<ref>See {{lds|Articles of Faith|a_of_f|1|9}} ("We believe the ''Bible'' to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly.")</ref> Joseph Smith worked on [[Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible|his own translation]], said to be more correct, but this was never canonized by the church. For [[English language]] speakers, the church encourages the use of the ''[[King James Version]]''<ref>{{Citation

The church's ''[[Doctrine and Covenants]]'' is a collection of revelations, declarations, and teachings on various subjects, primarily written by Joseph Smith. The ''[[Pearl of Great Price (Latter Day Saints)|Pearl of Great Price]]'' contains an excerpt from Smith's 1838 autobiographical writings, two portions of [[Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible|his translation]] of the ''Bible'', what Smith said was a translation of an [[Egyptian]] [[papyrus]] he purchased from a traveling [[mummy]] show, known as the ''[[Book of Abraham]]'', and an excerpt of one of Smith's [[Wentworth letter|1842 letters]] describing church beliefs, now known as the ''[[Articles of Faith]]''.

===Official periodicals: current and historical===
The church also publishes several official periodicals, including the ''[[Ensign (magazine)|Ensign]]'' (for [[English]]-speaking adults), the ''[[Liahona]]'' (non-English languages),<ref>The ''Liahona'' is currently published in over 50 [[language]]s. Material for [[adult]]s, youth, and [[children]] is included in each edition</ref> the ''[[New Era (magazine)|New Era]]'' (for youth), and the ''[[The Friend (Mormon magazine)|Friend]]'' (for children). Some older, discontinued English-language publications included ''[[Evening and Morning Star]]'' (1833–34), ''[[Messenger and Advocate]]'' (1834-37), ''[[Elders' Journal]]'' (1837), ''[[Times and Seasons]]'' (1839–46), ''[[Millennial Star]]'' (1840–1970), ''[[The Seer (periodical)|The Seer]]'' (1853-54), ''[[Journal of Discourses]]'' (1854–86), ''[[The Juvenile Instructor]]'' (1866–1930), ''[[Woman's Exponent]]'' (1872–1914), ''[[The Contributor]]'' (1879–96), ''[[Young Woman's Journal]]'' (1889–1929), ''[[Improvement Era]]'' (1897–1970), ''[[The Children's Friend (LDS magazine)|The Children's Friend]]'' (1902–70), ''[[Relief Society Magazine]]'' (1915–70), and ''[[The Instructor]]'' (1930–70).

==Beliefs and practices ==
Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have many beliefs in common with [[Catholic]], [[Orthodox]] and [[Protestant]] traditions, but also some significant differences exist. Some of the church's unique beliefs, circa 1842, are discussed in ''[[Articles of Faith (Latter Day Saints)]]''. A comparison between LDS Church doctrine and traditional Christian faiths are discussed in ''[[Mormonism and Christianity]]''. There are also numerous articles discussing [[Latter Day Saint movement]] perspectives on various doctrinal issues, which discuss the specific doctrines of the LDS Church as part of that movement. A summary of the church's major distinctive beliefs and practices are discussed below.

===God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost===

{{main|Godhead (Latter Day Saints)}}

[[Image:Christus statue temple square salt lake city.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Latter-day Saints believe in the resurrected Jesus Christ, as depicted in the Christus Statue in the North Visitors' Center on [[Temple Square]] in [[Salt Lake City]]]] 

The church teaches that [[God the Father]], [[Jesus Christ]], and the [[Holy Spirit|Holy Ghost]] are "one God", in the sense that they are one "in purpose", but does not accept the [[Nicene Creed]]'s definition of [[Trinity]], that the three are "[[Consubstantiality|consubstantial]]". Rather, the church teaches that the Father and the Son are two distinct beings, both with immortal bodies of flesh and bone, while the Holy Ghost, the third member of the Godhead, is a distinct being with a "[[spirit body]]".<ref>{{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|130|22}}</ref> God the Father is understood to be the father in [[Pre-existence|premortal life]] of all the spirits who inhabit this earth<ref>{{lds|Abraham|abr|3|21|26}}, {{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|93|29}}</ref> and the father of Jesus. "The place where God resides" is said to be located near a celestial body called [[Kolob]].<ref>[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/abr/fac_2 Book of Abraham: Explanation to Facsimile No. 2].</ref> 

The church teaches that Jesus is its central focus and emphasizes that his suffering in [[Gethsemane]] and on the cross paid for the sins of humanity. Mormons believe that Jesus was part God and part man, a status which gave him power over life and death. The church also believes in the physical [[Death and Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] of Jesus' body: that his body and [[spirit]] were reunited never to be separated. Because of its emphasis on Jesus' resurrection and his status as the living head of the church, the church places less emphasis on Jesus' [[crucifixion]] and does not officially use the [[symbol]] of the [[Christian cross]]. Instead, the church tends to focus on the belief that Jesus overcame suffering and [[death]] and that he lives today.

The church follows what it understands to be the teachings of Jesus, both in the ''[[Bible]]'' and in other scriptures, such as the ''[[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ]]'', which is said to contain the teachings of Jesus to a small group of [[Israelite]]s in the ancient Americas that had left [[Jerusalem]] prior to its destruction in [[587 BCE]]. The church also teaches that Jesus is the god [[Tetragrammaton|Jehovah]] of the [[Old Testament]]. Because Jesus is thought to be omniscient and have the same purpose as the Father, the church teaches that Jesus Christ often speaks in the scriptures as though he were God the Father, because in so doing he is fulfilling the will of the Father.

Official church materials refer to "Heavenly Parents," implying the existence of a [[Heavenly Mother (Latter Day Saints)|Heavenly Mother]].<ref>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, [http://lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.b3bc55cbf541229058520974e44916a0/?vgnextoid=32c41b08f338c010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&locale=0&sourceId=f04a7befabc20110VgnVCM100000176f620a____&hideNav=1&contentLocale=0 "Chapter 2: Our Heavenly Family"], ''Gospel Principles'', 11 (1997).</ref> Belief in such a figure is common among members, and she has been mentioned in sermons by church officials<ref>See, e.g., [[Spencer W.

===Apostasy, restoration, and priesthood ===
[[Image:Joseph Smith first vision stained glass.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] said that he saw two "personages" in the spring of 1820, one of which pointed to the other and said, "This is my beloved son. Hear him!" The church teaches this was an actual visitation by [[God the Father]] and [[Jesus]] in the flesh.]]
{{main|Restoration (Latter Day Saints)|Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)}}
In common with other [[Restorationism|Restorationist]] churches, the church believes in a [[Great Apostasy]]. It teaches that after the death of Jesus and the [[Twelve Apostles]], the [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]] authority was lost and some important doctrinal teachings, including the text of the ''[[Bible]]'', were changed from their original form, thus necessitating a [[Restoration (Latter Day Saints)|Restoration]] prior to the [[Second Coming]].  That restoration, according to church doctrine, took place during the life of [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]], the religion's founder.

According to church [[theology]], the restoration took place through a series of visions and revelations, including Smith's [[First Vision]] in 1820, visits by various [[angel]]ic messengers including [[Moroni (prophet)|Moroni]], [[John the Baptist]], [[Moses]], [[Elijah]], and the [[apostle]]s [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[James, son of Zebedee|James]] and [[John the Apostle|John]]. Smith said these messengers gave him [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood authority]] (first the [[Aaronic priesthood]] and then the [[Melchizedek priesthood]]) and various "keys" of the priesthood that had been lost through the ages, so that Smith finally possessed the "fulness of the Gospel". The restoration also included the formation of the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]]. The LDS Church teaches that it is the successor of this Church of Christ and that the current [[President of the Church (Latter Day Saints)|President of the Church]] is Smith's modern successor.

The priesthood authority is given as a matter of course to all male members ages 12 and older who generally follow the church's code of morality. Men receive the priesthood by [[ordination]], which consists of a blessing and the [[laying on of hands]]. Prior to 1978, [[black people|black men]] of sub-Saharan African descent were barred from being ordained to the priesthood and entering the religion's temples; in 1978, church president [[Spencer W. Kimball]] announced a revelation reversing this policy. (See [[Blacks and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].) Women are not ordained to offices in the priesthood, although some adherents believe that women are given priesthood power and authority in the church's [[Endowment (Latter Day Saints)|Endowment]] ceremony. (See [[Women and Mormonism]].)

For the most part, ordination to the priesthood is a prerequisite to preside in the church, although women are given un-ordained leadership roles over children and other women, and they perform certain temple ordinances. The priesthood is structured in a hierarchical manner, emphasizing obedience. Members are encouraged to avoid public criticism of priesthood leaders; repeated public criticism by an individual may eventually result in [[excommunication]]. (See [[Mormonism and authority]].) Although the church had a paid local clergy in the 1800s,<ref>D. Michael Quinn (1997), ''Mormon Hierarchy: Extensions of Power'', Salt Lake City: Signature Books, ch. 6.</ref> local and regional priesthood leaders currently serve as part-time volunteers. Non-clerical church employees, [[General authority|general authorities]] (who serve life or five-year terms), and [[mission president]]s (who serve three-year terms) are paid a stipend from church funds, and provided other benefits, although many of them are independently wealthy. A general missionary fund covers the basic living expenses of single [[Mormon missionary|Mormon missionaries]]. Missionaries and their families are asked to contribute to this fund, and in the United States the missionary's [[Ward (LDS Church)|ward]] of origin is ultimately responsible to satisfy the monthly obligation to the general fund. Members provide general custodial work for local church facilities.

===Ordinances, covenants and temples===
{{main|Ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|Covenant (Latter Day Saints)|Temple (Latter Day Saints)}}
[[Image:Salt Lake temple baptismal font.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Baptismal font in the [[Salt Lake Temple]], circa 1912, where [[baptism for the dead|baptisms for the dead]] are performed by proxy. The font rests on the backs of twelve oxen representing the [[Twelve Tribes of Israel]]]] 

Latter-day Saint [[sacrament]]s are called [[Ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|''ordinances'']], and there are two types: saving ordinances and non-saving ordinances. All ordinances, whether saving or nonsaving, must be performed by a man ordained to the appropriate [[priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]] office, with the exception of certain parts of the [[Endowment (Latter Day Saints)|Endowment]] and [[second anointing]], in which women can perform the ordinance without being ordained to an office.

====Saving ordinances====
Saving ordinances are those required for [[salvation]], and include [[baptism]] (by immersion), [[confirmation]] (laying on of hands for the [[gift of the Holy Ghost]]), ordination to an office of the [[priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]] (for males), the [[Endowment (Latter Day Saints)|Endowment]], [[celestial marriage]], [[Sealing (Latter Day Saints)|family sealings]], and arguably the [[second anointing]] (which is rarely performed today). Each saving ordinance is associated with one or more [[Covenant (Latter Day Saints)|covenant]] that the person receiving the ordinance makes with God. 

Saving ordinaces are considered absolutely necessary for exaltation, and the church teaches that they may be performed on a person either during their lifetime or by proxy after the person has died.<ref>LDS Church, [http://www.lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.b3bc55cbf541229058520974e44916a0/?vgnextoid=32c41b08f338c010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&locale=0&sourceId=0e0a7befabc20110VgnVCM100000176f620a____&hideNav=1&contentLocale=0 “Chapter 40: Temple Work and Family History”], ''Gospel Principles'', 255.</ref> Therefore, church members participate in the saving ordinances on behalf of dead relatives and others whose names have been extracted from historical records. The performance of these proxy ordinances are one of the functions of the church's [[Temple (Latter Day Saint)|temples]]. There have been certain exceptions to the church's policy of performing proxy work for all persons who have died: prior to the 1978 revelation admitting blacks to temple ceremonies, the church did not perform proxy ordinances for black men and women who had died, and since 1995, the church has agreed to discontinue performing ordinances for dead victims of the Jewish [[Holocaust]].{{Fact|date=May 2007}}

The church teaches that to obtain the highest degree of [[salvation]] (referred to as "[[Exaltation (LDS Church)|exaltation]]" in the [[celestial kingdom]]), all people who have lived to the age of eight must participate in each of the saving ordinances. All the saving ordinances, except arguably the [[second anointing]], are currently open to all worthy members of the appropriate age. Prior to 1978, [[black people|black members]] were barred from all saving ordinances other than baptism and confirmation, but this policy was changed in 1978. (See [[Blacks and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].) Celestial marriage is open to one man and one woman at a time, but a [[widower]] may enter a second celestial marriage, resulting in a [[plural marriage]] in the afterlife.

Apart from sealings to parents, the church does not perform saving ordinances for those younger than age eight or for those who have died before the age of eight (when children reach the "[[Coming of age#Age of accountability|age of accoutability]]"), because young children are deemed "alive in Christ" and not responsible for sin.<ref>{{lds|Moroni|moro|8|4|23}}; {{lds|D&C|dc|68|25|27}}; LDS Church, [http://www.lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.b3bc55cbf541229058520974e44916a0/?vgnextoid=32c41b08f338c010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&locale=0&sourceId=84aa7befabc20110VgnVCM100000176f620a____&hideNav=1&contentLocale=0 “Chapter 20: Baptism”], ''Gospel Principles'', 129.</ref> Likewise, the church teaches that the saving ordinances are not required for persons age eight or older who are "mentally incapable of knowing right and wrong".<ref>LDS Church, [http://www.lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.b3bc55cbf541229058520974e44916a0/?vgnextoid=32c41b08f338c010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&locale=0&sourceId=84aa7befabc20110VgnVCM100000176f620a____&hideNav=1&contentLocale=0 “Chapter 20: Baptism”], ''Gospel Principles'', 129.</ref> However, if such persons express a desire to receive the saving ordinances, they are generally not prohibited from doing so.{{Fact|date=May 2007}}

====Non-saving ordinances====
Non-saving ordinances include the "[[Sacrament (Latter Day Saints)|sacrament]]" (the Latter-day Saint version of the [[Eucharist]], taken each Sunday), the dedication of graves, the dedication of buildings, the [[prayer circle]], the [[Hosanna Shout]], [[shaking the dust from the feet]] (now rare), and various kinds of blessings such as the [[patriarchal blessing]]. Some nonsaving ordinances are associated with covenants, while others are not.

===Theology of family and gender===
{{see also |Celestial marriage|Women and Mormonism}}

The LDS Church has been characterized as a very [[family]]-centered religion. The church teaches that all individuals, including [[Jesus]], [[Satan]], and all the angels and [[devil]]s, have [[Spirit body|spirit bodies]] that were born to Heavenly Parents in the [[pre-existence]].<ref name=family /> The church teaches that on earth, families may be "[[Sealing (Latter Day Saints)|sealed]]"—meaning that they are eternally bound as [[husband]]-[[wife]], parent-child, and [[sibling]]-sibling—and that these bonds will continue after death.<ref>LDS Church, [http://www.lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.b3bc55cbf541229058520974e44916a0/?vgnextoid=32c41b08f338c010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&locale=0&sourceId=c2c97befabc20110VgnVCM100000176f620a____&hideNav=1&contentLocale=0 “Chapter 38: Eternal Marriage”], ''Gospel Principles'', 241.</ref> Sealings can also include deceased [[ancestor]]s, providing much of the church's rationale for its extensive [[family history]] activities.

The church also teaches that each person's [[gender]] is eternal and that [[gender role]]s are authorized by God: in general, men are to preside over and provide for their families and women are to nurture children.<ref name=family>LDS Church, [http://www.lds.org/library/display/0,4945,161-1-11-1,00.html The Family: A Proclamation to the World].</ref> The church characterizes the man-woman relationship as "equal but different".<ref>Sonja Farnsworth (1992), [http://www.signaturebookslibrary.org/women/chapter13.htm#Priesthood "Mormonism's Odd Couple: The Motherhood-Priesthood Connection"], in Maxine Hanks, ed., ''Women and Authority: Re-emerging Mormon Feminism'', Salt Lake City: Signature Books.</ref> Nevertheless, LDS women in the [[United States]] work outside the home in about the same [[percentage]] as other American women.<ref>Helen Witney & Jane Barnes (2007), [http://www.pbs.org/mormons/etc/script2.html ''The Mormons, Part 2''] (PBS presentation) ("Mormon women work outside the home in about the same proportions as other American women"),</ref> The church teaches that [[gender]] is inherently linked to sex, but the church has no official policy on the status of [[intersex]] persons.

===Sexuality===
{{see also |Sexuality and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Homosexuality and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}
The church teaches what it calls the [[law of chastity]], a [[morality|moral]] code which its members must follow to be in good standing with the church. At its core, the law of chastity prohibits [[fornication|pre-marital sex]] and [[adultery]],<ref>LDS Church (1997), ''Gospel Principles'', p. 249.</ref> which includes [[gay]] and [[lesbian]] sex and [[non-penetrative sex]]. The law also prohibits other [[human sexual behavior|sexual behavior]] such as [[bestiality]] and [[masturbation]], as well as mental behavior such as [[lust]], [[sexual fantasy]], and viewing of [[pornography]].<ref>Spencer W. Kimball (1969), ''The Miracle of Forgiveness'', Salt Lake City, Utah: Bookcraft, pp. 25, 77-89.</ref>

The church encourages members to enter a [[celestial marriage]], the only form of marriage recognized by the church as a [[ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|sacrament]], and "the only due and proper way of joining husband and wife".<ref>Heber J. Grant, J. Reuben Clark, Jr., David O. McKay (Oct. 1942), "Parenthood: First Presidency Message", ''Conference Report'', pp. 12-13.</ref> Celestial marriage, however, does not confer the right to have sex unless it is recognized by the government.<ref>This contrasts with the church's policy in the [[19th century]], when polygamous celestial marriages were illegal in the United States.</ref> For purposes of the law of chastity, the church recognizes most legal marital unions, except [[same-sex marriage]], [[Polygamy|polygamous marriage]], [[common law marriage]], and other types of non-ceremonial marriages in non-[[common law]] countries.<ref>The church is sensitive about its historical relationship with polygamy and entry into a polygamous marriage, even where legal, may result in excommunication: ''Church Handbook of Instructions, Book 1: Stake Presidencies and Bishoprics'' (2006), p. 110.</ref> The church's teachings are ambiguous about the scope of allowable [[human sexual behavior|sexual behavior]] between legally married couples.<ref>Some church leaders have taught that [[oral sex]], [[anal sex]], and [[contraception]] are sinful, even as part of a marriage relationship, but there are no policies on these issues that are enforced in the church. On [[January 5]], [[1982]] the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] issued a [http://www.lds-mormon.com/worthy_letter.shtml statement to church leaders] which stated that the First Presidency "has interpreted oral sex to constitute an unnatural, impure, or unholy practice". However, the statement also counseled church leaders to "scrupulously avoid" detailed inquries into the sexual practices of married couples and emphasized that married couples "can determine by themselves" what is appropriate in their sexual relationship.</ref>  The law of chastity has been interpreted to include standards of [[modesty]].<ref>See Gospel Topics - Modesty

''See'' ''Church Handbook of Instructions, Book 1: Stake Presidencies and Bishoprics'' (2006), p. 147.

=== Duties and expectations of church members ===  
{{See also|Perfection (Latter Day Saints)|Law of consecration}}   
   
Members of the church have a high degree of participation in religious activities outside of worship services. Church members are expected to donate their [[time]], [[money]], and [[talents]] to the church, and those who have participated in the [[Endowment (Latter Day Saints)|Endowment ceremony]] make an [[oath]] to donate all that they have, if required of them, to the church.

To be in good standing and to enter the church's [[Temple (Latter Day Saints)|temples]], church members are required to [[tithe]] their income to the church, which is usually interpreted as 10% of [[income]]. In addition, members are expected to donate monthly charitable "[[fast offering]]s" (at least the equivalent cost of two meals) and are occasionally encouraged to make other humanitarian donations.

In addition to attending the weekly three-hour church services, members are usually given "[[Calling (LDS Church)|callings]]" or assignments in the church, and often attend various other meetings or activities throughout the week relating to that calling. Members in good standing are assigned to visit the homes of other members monthly as "[[Home teaching|home teachers]]" (men) or "visiting teachers" (women). Members are also expected to engage in missionary work, [[family history]] research, to conduct a [[Family Home Evening]] weekly with their family, and to attend the [[temple (Latter Day Saints)|temple]] regularly (monthly if possible). Church members are encouraged to live self-sufficiently and avoid unnecessary [[debt]].<ref>{{lds|D&C|dc|104|78}}; Benson, Ezra Taft. "Pay Thy Debt, and Live." ''Ensign''. June 1987: p. 3. {{cite web | url=http://library.lds.org/nxt/gateway.dll/Magazines/Ensign/1987.htm/ensign%20june%201987.htm/first%20presidency%20message%20pay%20thy%20debt%20and%20live%20.htm | title=Available online. | accessdate=2006-10-22}}</ref>
   
On the [[morality]] front, good standing in the church requires that members follow the "[[Word of Wisdom]]"<ref>Doctrine and Covenants section 89, originally a strong recommendation, but adopted as a requirement by [[Brigham Young]] in 1851.</ref> (a [[health]] code given by Joseph Smith which the church interprets as requiring abstinence from [[alcoholic beverages]], [[tobacco]], [[coffee]], [[tea]], and [[recreational drugs]]). Members must also obey the [[law of chastity]] (the church's code for [[modesty]] and allowable forms of [[human sexuality|sexuality]]), and may not obtain an elective [[abortion]], except in the cases of a [[pregnancy]] resulting from [[rape]] or [[incest]], a pregnancy that seriously jeopardizes the life or health of the mother, or a pregnancy where a [[physician]] determines that the [[fetus]] has severe defects that will not allow the [[baby]] to survive beyond [[birth]].<ref>''Church Handbook of Instructions, Book 1:Stake Presidencies and Bishoprics'', 2006, p. 185.</ref> In general, members must obey the [[law]] of the [[country]] in which they live and visit, although there have been notable exceptions.<ref>For example, until 1890, the church advocated [[civil disobedience]] to U.S. anti-[[polygamy]] laws.</ref>

The church discourages [[gambling]] in all forms, including [[lottery|lotteries]].<ref>[http://www.lds.org/conference/talk/display/0,5232,89-1-520-21,00.html Gambling]. Gordon B. Hinckley, ''The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints''.</ref>

Church members who commit what are considered serious violations of the standards of the church (defined as, without limitation, "attempted murder, rape, sexual abuse, spouse abuse, intentional serious physical injury of others, adultery, fornication, homosexual relations, deliberate abandonment of family responsibilities, robbery, burglary, theft, embezzlement, sale of illegal drugs, fraud, perjury, and false swearing"<ref>''Church Handbook of Instructions, Book 1: Stake Presidencies and Bishoprics'' (2006), p. 110.</ref>) may be subject to church disciplinary action, including disfellowshipment or even [[excommunication]]. Such individuals are encouraged to continue attending church services, but are not permitted to hold church responsibilities or offer public prayer at any church meeting (although personal prayer is encouraged); excommunicated members are also prohibited from paying tithing or fast offerings. Other members are frequently unaware of the status of such individuals.<ref>{{cite journal| journal=Ensign |issue=Sept 1990| author=Russell M. Ballard | accessdate=2007-02-11 | title=A Chance to Start Over: Church Disciplinary Councils and the Restoration of Blessings |url=http://www.lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.b12f9d18fae655bb69095bd3e44916a0/?vgnextoid=2354fccf2b7db010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&locale=0&sourceId=edc72150a447b010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&hideNav=1 
}}</ref>. Everyone is welcome to attend the public meetings of the church, whether or not they adhere to the church's lifestyle code.

In contrast to overt actions which are prohibited, church members are generally permitted to think or believe freely on any issue, but are discouraged from publicly criticising local leaders or [[general authorities]]; repeated public criticism of the church or its leaders may subject a person to church discipline for [[apostasy]]. The church maintains a [[Strengthening Church Members Committee]] which monitors members' publications and refers critical material to local authorities for possible disciplinary action.

===Cosmology===
{{main|Plan of Salvation}}

The church's [[cosmology]] is referred to as the [[Plan of Salvation]]. It describes humanity's place in the [[universe]] and the purpose of life. The church teaches that there was a [[pre-existence]], a place, which existed prior to mortality, in which all people and all life were created in spirit form.<ref>{{lds|Moses|moses|3|5}}; {{lds|D&C|dc|93|29}}</ref> [[God the Father]] is said to have proposed a plan to send spirits to earth to be proven and, if worthy, receive added "glory".<ref>{{lds|Abraham|abr|3|25-26}}</ref> Satan, one of the spirits, proposed a rival plan whereby every soul would be saved, Satan would receive God's power, and human [[agency (Mormonism)|agency]] would be eliminated.<ref>See {{lds|Moses|moses|4|1-4}}</ref> When God rejected that plan, the [[First War in Heaven]] ensued, resulting in Satan and a third of the spirits becoming [[devils]]."<ref>{{lds|D&C|dc|29|36|37}}</ref>

The earth, according to church teachings in the temples, was created by [[Jehovah]], which the church identifies as the pre-mortal [[Jesus]], and [[Michael (archangel)|Michael the archangel]], who is identified as the pre-mortal [[Adam]]. The earth was "organized" from pre-existing [[matter]],<ref>See {{lds|Abraham|abr|3|24-25}}</ref> as were [[extrasolar planets|other planets]] with [[extraterrestrial life|their inhabitants]].<ref>{{lds|Moses|moses|1|29|33}}</ref> Michael's spirit was implanted in a body created by God the Father and Jehovah, and became Adam.

The church teaches that at birth, a pre-existing spirit enters a mortal body. Upon death, the spirit goes to a "[[spirit world]]" to await the [[resurrection of the dead]]. There, depending on the person's good deeds while alive, the spirit will be in either a state of [[paradise]] or [[spirit prison]]. Those in "prison" will be visited by spirits from paradise and given the chance to accept the teachings of Jesus Christ and the LDS saving [[Ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinances]].<ref>LDS Church, [http://www.lds.org/portal/site/LDSOrg/menuitem.b3bc55cbf541229058520974e44916a0/?vgnextoid=32c41b08f338c010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&locale=0&sourceId=6d8b7befabc20110VgnVCM100000176f620a____&hideNav=1&contentLocale=0 “Chapter 45: The Postmortal Spirit World”], ''Gospel Principles'', 289.</ref> The church teaches that all persons, wicked or righteous, will be resurrected and receive an [[immortality|immortal]], physical body.<ref>See {{lds|Alma|alma|11|42|45}}.</ref> The nature of that body, however, will depend on the result of the [[Last Judgment]], at which [[Jesus]] will assign each soul to one of three [[degrees of glory]] (heavenly kingdoms): the [[celestial kingdom]] in the presence of the Father and the Son for those who accept Jesus Christ and receive all LDS saving ordinances, either as a mortal or by proxy; the [[terrestrial kingdom]], a place of glory in the presence of Christ for righteous persons who refuse to receive the saving ordinances and for those who do not keep the [[Covenant (Latter Day Saints)|covenants]] they commit to; and the [[telestial kingdom]] for the wicked. A further destination, called [[outer darkness]], is reserved for [[Satan]], his devils, and those mortals who commit the [[Eternal sin|unpardonable sin]] and thereby become the [[sons of perdition]].<ref>LDS Church.

===View of history and eschatology===
The church's view of history is informed by the faith's scriptures. Mormon history begins with the [[creation according to Genesis]], but has never endorsed any particular form of [[creationism]]. Though it does not officially oppose any particular findings of [[natural history]], the church regards [[Adam]] as the first "primal parent of the [human] race".<ref>LDS Church (1909), First Presidency Statement: The Origin of Man.</ref>

Based on teachings in the ''[[Book of Mormon]]'', the church teaches an expansive form of [[American exceptionalism]], where the Americas are a special location reserved by God for those who love freedom and [[freedom of religion]]. According to Joseph Smith, what is now [[Jackson County, Missouri]] was the location of the [[Garden of Eden]] and will be the location of the future [[New Jerusalem]], and God has led numerous groups to the western hemisphere in search of freedom,<ref>See {{lds|2 Nephi|2_ne|1|5|7}}</ref> including several groups of ancestors to the [[Native Americans]], whose stories are told in the ''Book of Mormon''.

The church also teaches an expansive view of God's covenant with [[Abraham]], which Joseph Smith taught extends not just to [[Jews]], but to Mormons, who in most cases are declared by their [[Patriarchal blessing]]s to be descendants of the [[tribe of Ephraim]], one of the [[Ten Lost Tribes]]. [[Native Americans]] are typically declared to be descended from the [[Tribe of Manasseh]] based on the teachings of the ''Book of Mormon'' that members of this [[tribe]], the family of [[Lehi (Book of Mormon)|Lehi]], crossed the [[ocean]] in about [[600 B.C.]] and became their principal ancestors.

The church teaches that there will be a [[Millennium]], in which, after a period of [[tribulation]], the [[Second Coming]] of [[Jesus]] will occur, followed by a [[millennium|thousand years]] of [[peace]], after which will occur the [[Last Judgment]]. Distinctive within Latter-day millennialism, however, is the idea that [[Jesus]] will reign "personally upon the earth" from a location that is presently within the United States,<ref>{{lds|Article of Faith|a_of_f|1|10}}</ref> and direct the government or governments that will exist.<ref>Berrett, William E, Teachings of the Doctrine and Covenants, 1956, Ch. 42, p.280</ref> [[Jackson County, Missouri]] is expected to have an important LDS temple during the Millennium and [[Jerusalem]] is expected to be an important center of government in the world.<ref>Brewster, Hoyt W, Isaiah Plain and Simple: The Message of Isaiah in the Book of Mormon, 1995, Ch. 2, p.10-13</ref> As the earth transitions into the Millennial period, only those good and honorable people who stand to inherit the [[celestial kingdom]] or the [[terrestrial kingdom]] will continue on the earth; they will proselytize among the living and perform ordinances for the dead until a great crisis of good and [[evil]] prior to the [[Last Judgment]].

Romney'', 136 U.S. 44&ndash;45 (1890).</ref> the spelling and punctuation were standardized by hyphenating "Latter-day" and using a lower-case "d": ''The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints''.<ref>[http://content.lib.utah.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/uthisstat&CISOPTR=1756&REC=4 State of Deseret: An Ordinance, incorporating the Church or Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Feb. 4, 1851.]</ref> Since the mid-1900s, the church has consistently capitalized the initial article "The" to emphasize the church's position that it is "the" only true church of Jesus Christ.

The church is also known as the ''LDS Church'' and the ''Mormon Church''. Church members are known as ''Mormons'' or ''Latter-day Saints'', both being appellations accepted among Latter-day Saints themselves. The nickname "[[Mormon]]" arose soon after the publication of ''[[The Book of Mormon]]'' in 1830. Although originally used by those who opposed the church, the term came to be used widely within the church.

The church requests that the official name, ''The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints'', be used where possible, stating: "This full name was given by revelation from God to Joseph Smith in 1838."<ref name="styleguide">[http://www.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=ca07ae4af9c7e010VgnVCM1000004e94610aRCRD A style guide] issued by the Church in 2001</ref> It also encourages the use of "the Church" or "the Church of Jesus Christ" as shortened references, although "LDS Church" is commonly used within the church's own publications and the church officially uses "Mormon" as a descriptive term for itself in the name of the ''[[Mormon Tabernacle Choir]]'' and the website [http://beta.mormon.org ''mormon.org'']. When referring to members of the church, it suggests "Latter-day Saints" as preferred, although "Mormons" is acceptable.<ref name="styleguide" /> Despite these efforts, the [[Associated Press]] continues to recommend "Mormon Church" as a proper second reference in its ''Style Guide'' for journalists, and the church itself uses "Mormon Church" on some of its websites.

=== Legal entities ===
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was formally incorporated in 1851. That corporation, however, was dissolved by [[Edmunds-Tucker Act|an act]] of the [[United States Congress]] in 1887 because of the church's practice (now abandoned) of [[polygamy]]. Thereafter, the church has continued to operate as an "unincorporated religious association". However, the church has organized several tax-exempt corporations to assist with the transfer of money and capital. These include the ''Corporation of the Presiding Bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints'', organized in 1916 under the laws of the state of [[Utah]] to acquire, hold, and dispose of [[real property]]. In 1923, the church incorporated the ''Corporation of the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints'' in [[Utah]] to receive and manage money and church donations. In 1997, the church incorporated [[Intellectual Reserve|Intellectual Reserve, Inc.]] to hold all the church's [[copyright]]s, [[trademark]]s, and other [[intellectual property]].

=== Priesthood hierarchy ===
The church has a hierarchical structure, with clearly defined stewardships or realms of responsibility for the various offices. Those who hold such offices do not elect to do so but are "called" by someone of a higher authority in the church; all are laymen and are not paid for their service.

[[Image:Hinckley message.jpg|right|framed|[[Gordon B. Hinckley]] is regarded by church members as [[God]]'s [[prophet]] upon the Earth today.]] 	 
The leader of the church is termed [[President of the Church (Latter Day Saints)|President]], and church members revere him as a [[prophet, seer, and revelator]]. The prophet is believed to hold the same divine calling as biblical prophets, and his responsibility is over the church as a whole. He is entitled to guide the church through [[Revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelation]], acting as God's spokesman.  The President of the Church serves as such until death. Historically, the senior [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] of the church has always become the new President of the Church. The current President is [[Gordon B. Hinckley]].

The [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]], the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]], the [[Presiding Bishop (LDS Church)|Presiding Bishopric]] and the [[Seventy (Latter Day Saints)|First and Second Quorums of the Seventy]] are all referred to as ''[[general authorities]]'' because they direct the work of the entire church throughout the world. The members of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles are accepted by the church as [[prophets, seers, and revelators]]. 

Other church authorities are referred to as ''area authorities'' and ''local authorities'' and include all other [[Quorums of the Seventy]], [[Mission (LDS Church)|mission presidents]], [[Stake (Mormonism)|stake presidents]], [[bishop]]s, and other [[Quorum (Mormonism)|priesthood quorum]] presidents. 

The church has no salaried ministry; however, general authorities who demonstrate need receive stipends from the church, using income from church-owned investments.<ref>Ludlow, Daniel H., Latter-day Prophets Speak: Selections from the Sermons and Writings of Church Presidents, 1948/1993, Ch. 32</ref> All area and local authorities are [[Laity|unpaid]] and continue in their normal occupations while serving in leadership positions.

The church teaches that [[Revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelation]] from God continues today, but only as far as one's own responsibility is concerned. Accordingly, revelation to direct the entire church comes to the President; revelation to direct a [[Stake (Mormonism)|stake]] comes to the stake president; for a [[Ward (Mormonism)|ward]], to the bishop, and so forth. Latter-day Saints also believe that individuals can receive personal revelation and divine guidance in raising their families and managing their personal affairs. Because of their belief in modern revelation, Latter-day Saints give significant weight to the teachings of their church leaders. They revere the words their prophets and [[General authority|general authorities]] speak when "moved upon by the Holy Ghost",<ref>{{lds|D&C|dc|8|3|4}}. Members are encouraged to listen carefully to [[General conference (Mormonism)|general conference]] but also feel they can rely on personal revelation in order to appreciate validity of such statements. (see Joseph F. Smith, in Conference Report, April 1902, and [http://library.lds.org/nxt/gateway.dll/Magazines/Ensign/1981.htm/ensign%20november%201981.htm/conference%20time.htm Howard W. Hunter] in Conference Report, October 1981.)</ref> as modern-day scripture, and members are encouraged to ponder and pray for revelation regarding the truthfulness of such statements.

===Relief Society and women's status===   

{{main|Relief Society}}   
   
The Relief Society is the women's organization of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Founded in 1842 in [[Nauvoo]], [[Illinois]], and with the motto "Charity Never Faileth", the organization today includes more than 5 million women in over 165 countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lds.org/newsroom/showpackage/0,15367,3899-1--43-2-125,00.html|publisher=newsroom.lds.org|title=From Pioneer Group to Worldwide Society}}</ref> Every Latter-day Saint woman age 18 or older is a member of the Relief Society.

The status of women in church leadership has remained largely unchanged since the early [[1900s]]. Although they are not ordained to the [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]], preaching and instruction by women is an integral part of weekly Latter-day Saint worship. Certain leadership positions are filled only by women, and in some of the church's auxiliary organizations women may preside over men, such as in the [[Primary (Mormonism)|Primary]], in welfare programs, on activities committees, at a [[Family History Library]], and so forth. Since the 1840s, women have officiated in certain [[ordinance (Mormonism)|ordinances]] (sacred rites) that take place inside [[Temple (Latter Day Saints)|temples]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mormon.org/learn/0,8672,1588-1,00.html |title= Women and the priesthood |accessdate=2006-11-05 |work=[http://mormon.org/ Mormon.org] |publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints }}</ref>

===Current membership===
{{see also|Membership history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}
The Church reports a worldwide membership of 12,868,606<ref name="currentmembership"/>  (as of December 31, 2006) with approximately 6.7 million residing outside the United States. According to these statistics it is the fourth largest religious body in the United States.<ref>[http://www.electronicchurch.org ''2005 Yearbook of American and Canadian Churches''], National Council of Churches.  See article by [http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0001481.html Information Please® Database], Pearson Education, Inc.</ref> The church membership report includes all baptized members and also "children of record"—unbaptized children under the age of nine. (Children are not baptized before the age of eight.) Although the church does not release attendance figures to the public, researchers estimate that actual attendance at weekly LDS worshsip services globally is around 4 million.<ref>Fletcher, Peggy. [http://www.sltrib.com/search/ci_2890645M "Keeping Members a Challenge for LDS Church]". ''Salt Lake Tribune'', 22 June 2006.</ref> Members living in the U.S. and [[Canada]] constitute 47% of membership, [[Latin America]] 36%, and members in the rest of the world 17%.<ref name="currentmembership"/> A Survey by the [[City College of New York]] in 2001 extrapolated that there were 2,787,000 self-identified LDS adults in the [[United States]] in 2001, an increase of 1.3% over their 1991 survey, making the LDS Church the 10th-largest religious body in their phone survey of over 50,000 households.<ref>{{cite web | title=American Religious Identification Survey | work=cuny.edu | url=http://www.gc.cuny.edu/faculty/research_briefs/aris/key_findings.htm | author=Egon Mayer, Ph.D.; Barry A.

===Finances===
[[Image:Lds church administration building.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Church Administration Building with the [[LDS Church Office Building]] tower in the background]]
{{main|Finances of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}} 

The church does not disclose information about its finances to its members or the public, but [[as of 1997]] it was estimated to be one of the world's wealthiest churches per capita<ref>Biema, David Van. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,986794,00.html Kingdom Come]. ''[[Time Magazine]]'', Vol. 150 No. 5, August 4, 1997 (estimating the church's value at over $30 billion).</ref> It receives most of its money from [[tithe]]s (ten percent of a member's income) and ''[[fast offering]]s'' (which is the cost a member would have spent on food for two meals but fasted instead and therefore donates that money to the church). About ten percent of its funding also comes from income on investments and real estate holdings.<ref>[http://mormoninquiry.typepad.com/mormon_inquiry/2004/10/lds_revenues_an.html Mormon Inquiry article]</ref> 

The church uses its funds to construct and maintain buildings and other facilities, as well as providing social welfare and relief and supporting missionary, educational, and other church-sponsored programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lds.org/newsroom/page/0,15606,4032-1---14-168,00.html|publisher=newsroom.lds.org|title=Church Finances}}</ref>. The church has also invested in business and real estate ventures such as [[Bonneville International]], [[Deseret Book Company]], and cattle ranches in [[Utah]], [[Florida]], and [[Canada]].

===Programs===
====Church Educational System====
{{main|Church Educational System}}

Latter-day Saints believe in the value of education.  Joseph Smith taught that "the glory of God is intelligence."<ref>{{lds|D&C|dc|93|36}}</ref> Accordingly, the church maintains [[Brigham Young University]], [[Brigham Young University-Idaho]] (formerly Ricks College), [[Brigham Young University-Hawaii]], and [[LDS Business College]]. The church also has [[religious education]] programs. ''[[Seminary]]'' is a program for secondary school students held daily in conjunction with the school year. The ''[[Institute of Religion]]'' program serves young adults between the ages of 18 and 30 and those enrolled in [[post-secondary education]] institutions with church-owned buildings near university and college campuses designated for the purpose of religious education and cultural socialization.

In addition, the church sponsors a low-interest educational loan program known as the [[Perpetual Education Fund]]. This fund is designed to benefit young men and women from all parts of the world who have served a [[Mormon missionary|mission]], returned to their home, and need further education to become productive citizens in their respective countries. As they finish their education and enter the work force, they then are able to pay back the funds provided so that other individuals can attend both [[vocational]] [[technical schools]] and university.

==== Missionary program====   
{{main|Mormon missionary}}   
{{see also|Mission (LDS Church)}}
Young men between the ages of 19 and 25 who meet minimum standards of worthiness and preparation are encouraged to consider serving a two-year, full-time proselytizing mission. Women (less encouraged but supported) who desire to serve a mission must be at least 21 and generally serve 18-month missions. Retired married couples are encouraged to serve missions as well, and their length of service varies from three to 36 months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lightplanet.com/mormons/daily/missionary/mormon_missionaries.html|title=Mormon Missionaries|publisher=Light Planet}}</ref>

Today there are 344 missions and approximately 53,000 full time proselytizing missionaries serving throughout the world.<ref name="currentmembership"/> In addition, about 3,552 missionaries are on special assignment missions, serving as health care specialists, doctors, craftsmen, artisans, construction supervisors, agricultural experts and educators for developing countries and educators, family history researchers and leadership trainers.<ref name="currentmembership"/>

== Worship and culture ==
[[Image:LDS Chapel.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The chapel in the [[Joseph Smith Memorial Building]] in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]]. Although within a downtown office building, it still follows the standard design of LDS chapels throughout the world.]]
===Worship services=== 
{{main|Worship services of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}

Weekly worship services, including [[sacrament meetings]], are held on Sundays (or Saturday when local custom or law prohibits Sunday worship) in neighborhood-based religious units, and twice each year the church holds a worldwide [[General Conference (Latter Day Saints)|general conference]]. [[Congregation (worship)|Congregations]] for Sunday services are grouped geographically, with larger (~200 to ~400 people) congregations known as [[Ward (Mormonism)|wards]], and smaller (two through ~200 people) congregations known as branches. These neighborhood congregations meet in meetinghouses, also referred to as "chapels" or "stake centers", located on property most often owned by the church. In some geographic areas, rental property may be used as a meetinghouse. Although the building may sometimes be referred to as a "chapel", the room used as a chapel for religious services is actually only one component of the standard meetinghouse.<ref>[http://www.mormon.org/virtualchapel/virtualchapel.html A church-maintained virtual tour of a typical meetinghouse]</ref> Visitors or members can use the church's online "Meetinghouse Locator" to find locations of church buildings and meeting times.<ref>See [http://www.mormon.org/worshipwithus http://www.mormon.org/worshipwithus]</ref>

[[Image:Mormon Church in Puerto Princesa.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Latter-day Saint chapel in [[Puerto Princesa City|Puerto Princesa, Philippines]] ]]

All persons, regardless of their beliefs or standing in or out of the church, are welcome to attend.<ref>[http://www.mormon.org/question/worship/1,8578,797-1,00.html Open invitation to attend church, on Church-maintained website]</ref> The [[Sacrament (Mormonism)|sacrament]] (similar to Communion, the Lord's Supper, or the [[Eucharist]] in other churches) is offered weekly (only on Sunday at the time a ward meets) to those wishing to participate. Mondays are reserved for [[Family Home Evening]]; members meet in meetinghouses for various activities throughout the rest of the week.

Women usually attend worship services wearing skirts or dresses, while men typically wear suits or dress shirts (preferably white) and ties. Children are also typically in their "Sunday best."<ref>Mormon.org. {{cite web | url=http://mormon.org/book/0,9768,826-1,00.html | title=What to expect at Sunday meetings | accessdate=2006-10-22}}</ref>

=== Temple worship ===

{{main|Temple (Latter Day Saints)}}

Two years after the organization of the Church, in 1832, Joseph Smith, Jr., reported receiving a revelation that called upon church members to build a ''House of the Lord'' to restore the practice of temple worship.<ref>[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/124/47,51,72,145#31 Doctrine & Covenants 124:31]</ref> The Church built its [[Kirtland Temple|first temple]] in [[Kirtland, Ohio|Kirtland]], [[Ohio]] in 1836.  This temple was used primarily for instruction and learning.<ref>Encyclopedia of Mormonism, Vol.2, KIRTLAND TEMPLE</ref>

[[Image:363px-Bern Tempel 20 Jan 1981.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Bern Switzerland Temple]], dedicated in 1955, was the first LDS temple in Europe]]
In 1846 the [[Nauvoo Temple]] was built in [[Nauvoo]], [[Illinois]].  With this temple came the introduction of special ordinances, such as the [[Endowment (Mormonism)|endowment]] and [[baptism for the dead]].<ref>Encyclopedia of Mormonism, Vol.3, NAUVOO TEMPLE — ''see'' [[Ordinance (Mormonism)]]</ref>  When the Latter-day Saints moved west to [[Utah Territory|Utah]], they were forced to abandon these temples. The [[Nauvoo Temple]] was destroyed by fire and the [[Kirtland Temple]] is owned by the [[Community of Christ]].  

Soon after the arrival of the saints in the Rocky Mountains, they began building several temples, including the well-known [[Salt Lake Temple]], which took 40 years to complete.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/newsroom/showpackage/0,15367,3899-1---2-119,00.html |title=Granite and Faith: The Story of the Salt Lake Temple |accessdate=2006-10-22}}</ref> The church continued to build temples as membership grew. {{LDS Temple status}}  ''See [[List of temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]''.

Today faithful members of the church are encouraged to regularly attend [[Temple (Latter Day Saints)|temples]] and participate in [[Ordinance (Mormonism)|ordinances]] there, such as [[baptism for the dead]]. The church teaches that certain temple ordinances, including being married in the temple, are necessary for [[Exaltation (Latter Day Saints)|eternal salvation]]. The church also regards the temples as places of peace and refuge that are set apart from the world. Adult members who have performed a temple ordinance called an [[Endowment (Mormonism)|endowment]] also receive a [[Temple garment (Mormonism)|temple garment]] which they wear as underclothes. The church considers the temple ordinances exceptionally sacred and does not discuss them publicly. Non-members or members without a recommendation from church leaders to enter the temple are not permitted to attend or observe temple ordinances. For a member to receive a recommendation to enter the temple they must be found worthy by local leaders of the church. However, the general public, member or non member, is invited to attend an open house of the temple prior to its dedication.

===General Conference===
{{main|General conference (Latter Day Saints)}}

Twice a year (spring and autumn), the church holds [[General conference (Mormonism)|General Conference]], in which the president of the church and other leaders speak from [[Temple Square]] in Salt Lake City, Utah. These sermons, given in several sessions over two days, are carried worldwide by radio, television, satellite and Internet broadcasts. They are translated into numerous languages, and are later made available on DVD (complete with translations) and also printed in church publications such as ''[[Ensign (magazine)|Ensign]]'' and ''[[Liahona]]''.  Attendees come from around the world.

[[Image:LDS Conference Center interior panoramic.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Interior of the [[LDS Conference Center]] where the Church holds its semi-annual [[General Conference (Mormonism)|General Conference]]]]

Conference sermons address doctrinal topics drawn from scriptures and personal experiences, messages of faith and hope, church history and information on the church as it expands throughout the world.  

Throughout the twentieth century, conference sermons were delivered in the [[Salt Lake Tabernacle]]. With a maximum capacity of about 3000, the Tabernacle would typically be filled and thousands of other attendees would sit on blankets on Temple Square lawns. In 2001, the church's [[Conference Center]] was opened, and since that time talks have been given in the Center's 21,000-seat auditorium.

Conference satellite broadcasts may be watched live or time-delayed in thousands of church buildings worldwide. The public is invited to attend General Conference, either through these broadcasts, in the Conference Center or other areas at Temple Square.

===Culture===
{{Main article |Culture of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}
Due to the differences in lifestyle promoted by church doctrine and history, a distinct culture has grown up around members of the Church. It is primarily concentrated in the [[Rocky Mountains]], but as membership of the Church spreads around the world, many of its more distinctive practices follow, such as following the [[Word of Wisdom]], a health code prohibiting the consumption of [[tobacco]], [[alcohol]], [[coffee]] and [[tea]], and other addictive substances.<ref>See Doctrine & Covenants, Section 89.</ref>  Because of such prohibitions, the culture in areas of the world with a high concentration of Mormons tends to reflect these restrictions.<ref>Salt Lake Tribune Editorial, [http://www.sltrib.com/ci_4903619 ''Liquor stores: Banning phone listings, stores won't stop abuse''].</ref> 

Meetings and outreach programs are held regularly and have become part of the Latter-day Saint culture.

====Young men and women====
{{main|Young Men Organization}}
{{main|Young Women Organization}}
Young men and women aged 12 to 18 often have an additional meeting during the week (referred to as Mutual or (previously) MIA, which are short for ''Mutual Improvement Association''), which can involve an activity, game, service project, or instruction. The young men and women may meet separately or take part in a combined activities. In the United States and Canada, the young men participate in [[Scouting]], including efforts to gain the [[religious emblems programs (Boy Scouts of America)|Duty to God]] award and an award unique to the LDS Church, "On my Honor." Young women participate in a comparable program called [[Personal Progress]]. Both the young men and the young women are encouraged to live by the standards outlined in the church's ''[[For the Strength of Youth]]'' booklet.

====Institutes of Religion====

{{main|Institute of Religion}}

LDS Institutes of Religion are located throughout the United States and Canada, usually close to college and university campuses. They offer a variety of religion classes free of charge, which are open both to members and non-members of the church. Institutes of Religion are also designed to be places for young Latter-day Saint students to associate with one another and have activities.

====Home, family, and personal enrichment====
Four times a year the adult women (members of the church's [[Relief Society]]) attend a Home, Family, and Personal Enrichment Meeting (formerly known as Homemaking Meeting). The meeting may consist of a service project, or of attending a social event, or of various classes being offered. In addition, Enrichment activities are offered (weekly, monthly, or as determined by ward Relief Society leaders) for women with similar needs and interests.

====Social events and gatherings====
[[Image:PSP 028.jpg|thumb|LDS stake center. Stake centers serve as meetinghouses for local congregations and headquarters for the local stake.]]
In addition to these regularly scheduled meetings, additional meetings are frequently held at the meetinghouse. Auxiliary officers may conduct leadership meetings or host training sessions and classes.  The ward or branch community may schedule social activities at the meetinghouse, including dances, dinners, holiday parties and musical presentations.  Other popular activities are basketball, family history conferences, youth and singles conferences, dances and various personal improvement classes. Church members may also reserve the building for personal or family use, to accommodate such events as music recitals, family reunions, weddings and receptions, birthdays, or funerals.

====Media community====
The culture has created substantial business opportunities for LDS media. The largest of these communities are [[LDS cinema]], and LDS Fiction, LDS websites, and LDS graphical art like photography and paintings. The church owns a chain of bookstores called [[Deseret Book]] which provide an avenue for much of this media to be sold. This culture also resides outside of heavily Mormon populations and many LDS bookstores exist near many temples where many members commonly visit. Some of the titles that have become popular outside of the LDS community are "[[The Work and the Glory]]" series of novels, and "[[The Other Side of Heaven]]" movie. There are a number of titles that have become huge successes within the LDS community. These titles generally elaborate on LDS culture or historical fiction in some manner.
