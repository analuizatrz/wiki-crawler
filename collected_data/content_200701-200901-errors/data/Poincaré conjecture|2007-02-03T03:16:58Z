{{Millennium Problems}}
In [[mathematics]], the '''Poincaré conjecture''' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: [{{IPA|pwɛ̃kaˈʁe}}])<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/61/wavs/3/P0400300.wav Poincaré pronunciation example at Bartleby.com]</ref> is a [[conjecture]] about the [[Characterization (mathematics)|characterization]] of the [[three-dimensional sphere]] amongst [[3-manifold|three-dimensional manifolds]]. The conjecture concerns a space that locally looks like ordinary three dimensional space but is finite in size and lacks any boundary (a [[Closed manifold|closed]] [[3-manifold]]). The conjecture claims that if such a space has the additional property that each [[path (topology)|loop]] in the space can be continuously tightened to a point, then it is  just a [[3-sphere|three-dimensional sphere]]. An analogous result has been known  in higher dimensions for some time.

After nearly a century of effort by mathematicians, a series of papers made available in 2002 and 2003 by [[Grigori Perelman]], following the program of [[Richard Hamilton (professor)|Richard Hamilton]], sketched a solution. Three groups of mathematicians have produced works filling in the details of Perelman's proof.

The Poincaré conjecture is  one of the most important questions in [[topology]]. It is one of the seven [[Millennium Prize Problems]] for which the [[Clay Mathematics Institute]] is offering a $1,000,000 prize for the first correct solution.
Perelman's work is under review and the prize money could be awarded if the proof is considered valid two years after publication.<ref>"[http://www.icm2006.org/dailynews/dailynews29.pdf Interview with Jim Carlson]" in ''ICM 2006 Daily News'', Madrid [[August 29]] [[2006]], p. 1</ref><ref>"Before consideration, a proposed solution must be published in a refereed mathematics publication of worldwide repute (or such other form as the SAB shall determine qualifies), and it must also have general acceptance in the mathematics community two years after." from [http://www.claymath.org/millennium/Rules_etc/ Rules for the Millennium Prizes], Revision of [[January 19]], [[2005]], available at the website of the Clay Mathematics Institute</ref> 

On [[December 22]], [[2006]], ''[[Science (journal)|Science Magazine]]'' awarded Perelman's proof of the Poincaré Conjecture as the scientific "[[Breakthrough of the Year]]," the first time ever awarded in the area of mathematics.<ref>{{cite  journal | last = Mackenzie | first = Dana | authorlink = Dana Mackenzie | title = The Poincaré Conjecture--Proved | journal = Science | volume = 314 | issue = 5807 | pages = 1848--1849 | date = 2006-12-22 | publisher = American Association for the Advancement of Science | doi = 10.1126/science.314.5807.1848 | id = ISSN: 0036-8075 | url= http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/314/5807/1848 | accessdate = 2006-12-29 | work = BREAKTHROUGH OF THE YEAR

==History==
===Poincaré's question===
At the beginning of the 20th century, [[Henri Poincaré]] was working on the foundations of topology &mdash; what would later be called [[combinatorial topology]] and then [[algebraic topology]].  He was particularly interested in what topological properties characterized a [[sphere]].  

Poincaré claimed in 1900 that [[homology (mathematics)|homology]], a tool he had devised based on prior work by [[Enrico Betti]], was sufficient to tell if a [[3-manifold]] was a [[3-sphere]].  In a 1904 paper he described a counterexample, now called the [[Poincaré sphere]], that had the same homology as a 3-sphere.  Poincaré was able to show the Poincaré sphere had a [[fundamental group]] of order 120.  Since the 3-sphere has trivial fundamental group, he concluded this was a different space.  The Poincaré sphere was the first example of a [[homology sphere]], of which many others have since been constructed.

In the same paper, Poincaré wondered whether a 3-manifold with the homology of a 3-sphere but also trivial fundamental group had to be a 3-sphere.  Poincaré's new condition, i.e. "trivial fundamental group", can be phrased as "every loop can be shrunk to a point".  

The original phrasing was as follows:

<blockquote>Consider a compact 3-dimensional manifold V without boundary. Is it possible that the fundamental group of V could be trivial, even though V is not homeomorphic to the 3-dimensional sphere? </blockquote>

Poincaré never declared whether he believed this additional condition would characterize the 3-sphere, but nonetheless, the statement that it does is known as the '''Poincaré conjecture'''.  Here is the standard form of the conjecture:

<blockquote>Every [[simply connected]] [[compact space|compact]]  3-[[manifold]] (without boundary) is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to a [[3-sphere]].</blockquote>

===In other dimensions===
The conjecture can be generalized to other dimensions, and was solved much earlier (it has a substantially different flavor): see [[Generalized Poincaré Conjecture]].

===Attempted solutions===
For a time, this problem seems to have lain dormant, until [[J. H. C. Whitehead]] revived interest in the conjecture, when in the [[1930s]] he first claimed a proof, and then retracted it. In the process, he discovered some interesting examples of simply connected non-compact 3-manifolds not homeomorphic to '''R'''<sup>3</sup>, the prototype of which is now called the [[Whitehead manifold]].

In the [[1950s]] and [[1960s]], other  mathematicians were to claim proofs only to discover a  flaw. Influential mathematicians such as [[RH Bing|Bing]], [[Wolfgang Haken|Haken]], [[Edwin Moise|Moise]], and [[Christos Papakyriakopoulos|Papakyriakopoulos]] attacked the conjecture.  In 1958 Bing proved a weak version of the Poincaré conjecture: if every simple closed curve of a compact 3-manifold is contained in a 3-ball, then the manifold is homeomorphic to the 3-sphere. <ref> R.H. Bing

Over time, the conjecture gained the reputation of being particularly tricky to tackle.  [[J. W. Milnor|John Milnor]] commented that sometimes the errors in false proofs can be "rather subtle and difficult to detect."<ref>[http://www.math.sunysb.edu/~jack/PREPRINTS/poiproof.pdf "The Poincaré Conjecture 99 Years Later: A Progress Report"] ([[PDF]] file) by [[J. W. Milnor|John Milnor]], February 2003</ref> Work on the conjecture has improved understanding of 3-manifolds.  Experts in the field have been reluctant to announce proofs, and have viewed any such announcement with skepticism. The [[1980s]] and [[1990s]] witnessed some well-publicized fallacious proofs (which were not actually published in [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] form).

===Hamilton's Program and Perelman's solution ===
Hamilton's program was started in the paper
*R. Hamilton, ''Three-manifolds with positive Ricci curvature'', J. Diff. Geom 17 (1982), 255-306 (reprinted in ''Collected Papers on Ricci Flow'' ISBN 1-57146-110-8).
He introduced the [[Ricci flow]] on a manifold and showed how to use it to prove some special cases of the Poincaré conjecture. In the following years he extended this work, introducing many ideas later used by Perelman.

In late 2002 and 2003 [[Grigori Perelman]] of the [[Steklov Institute of Mathematics]], [[Saint Petersburg]] posted 3 papers on the [[arXiv]]:<ref>By April 2003 the press was reporting on these developments [http://www.ams.org/mathmedia/mathdigest/200305-poincare.html Mathematical Digest]</ref>

* [http://arxiv.org/abs/math.DG/0307245 ''Finite extinction time for the solutions to the Ricci flow on certain three-manifolds''], 2003
In these papers he sketched a proof of the Poincaré conjecture and a more general conjecture, [[Thurston's geometrization conjecture]], completing the Ricci flow program  outlined earlier by [[Richard Hamilton (professor)|Richard Hamilton]]. 

From May to July 2006, several groups presented papers that  filled in the details of Perelman's proof of the Poincaré conjecture, as follows:
*[[Bruce Kleiner]] and [[John Lott]],  [http://arxiv.org/abs/math.DG/0605667 ''Notes on Perelman's Papers''] (May 2006) filled in the details of Perelman's proof of the geometrization conjecture.

All three groups found that the errors and gaps in Perelman's papers were minor and could be filled in using his techniques. 

On [[August 22]], [[2006]], the [[International Congress of Mathematicians|ICM]] awarded Perelman the [[Fields Medal]] for his work on the conjecture, but Perelman refused the medal.<ref name="NY">[[Sylvia Nasar]] and David Gruber, "[[Manifold destiny]]", ''[[The New Yorker]]'', [[August 28]], [[2006]], pp. 44–57.

==Ricci flow with surgery==
{{main|Ricci flow}}
Hamilton's program for proving the Poincaré conjecture involves first putting a [[Riemannian metric]] on the unknown simply connected 3-manifold. The idea is to try to improve this metric; for example, if the metric can be improved enough so that it has constant curvature, the manifold is easy to identify as all constant curvature manifolds are well understood. The metric is improved using the [[Ricci flow]] equations;
:<math>\partial_t g_{ij}=-2 R_{ij}</math>
where ''g'' is the metric and ''R'' its Ricci curvature, 
and one hopes that as the time ''t'' increases the manifold becomes easier to understand. Ricci flow expands the negative curvature part of the manifold and contracts the positive curvature part. 

In some cases Hamilton was able to show that this works; for example, if the manifold has positive Ricci curvature everywhere he showed that the manifold becomes extinct in finite time under Ricci flow without any other singularities. (In other words, the manifold collapses to a point in finite time; it is easy to describe the structure just before the manifold collapses.) This easily implies the Poincaré conjecture in the case of positive Ricci curvature. However in general the Ricci flow equations lead to singularities of the metric after a finite time. Perelman showed how to continue past these singularities: very roughly, he cuts the manifold along the  singularities, splitting the manifold into several pieces, and then continues with the Ricci flow on each of these pieces. This procedure is known as '''Ricci flow with surgery'''. 

A special case of Perelman's theorems about Ricci flow with surgery is given as follows. 
:The Ricci flow with surgery on a closed  oriented 3-manifold is well defined for all time. If the fundamental group is a free product of finite groups and cyclic groups then the Ricci flow with surgery becomes extinct in finite time, and at all times all components of the manifold are connected sums of ''S''<sup>2</sup> bundles over ''S''<sup>1</sup> and quotients of ''S''<sup>3</sup>.

This result  implies the Poincaré conjecture because it is easy to check it for the possible manifolds listed in the conclusion. 

The condition  on the fundamental group turns out to be necessary (and sufficient) for finite time extinction, and in particular includes the case of trivial fundamental group. It is equivalent to saying that the prime decomposition of the manifold has no acyclic components, and turns out to be equivalent to the condition that all geometric pieces of the manifold have geometries based on the two Thurston geometries ''S''<sup>2</sup>&times;'''R''' and ''S''<sup>3</sup>. By studying the limit of the manifold for large time, Perelman proved  Thurston's geometrization conjecture for any fundamental group: at large times the manifold has a [[thick-thin decomposition]], whose thick piece has a hyperbolic structure, and whose thin piece is a [[graph manifold]], but this extra complication is not necessary for proving just the Poincaré conjecture.
