==Biography==
===Early life===
[[Image:w_universe.jpg|150px|left|thumb|Sean Connery at the Mr Universe contest]] 
Thomas Sean Connery was born in [[Edinburgh]] on [[25 August]] [[1930]]. His father, Joseph Connery, was a [[Roman Catholicism in Scotland|Roman Catholic]] of [[Irish-Scots|Irish descent]] with roots in [[County Wexford]], while his mother, Euphamia "Effie" Maclean, was a [[Protestant]]. He alleges that he was called by his middle name Sean long before he became an actor, explaining that he had an Irish friend named Seamus and those who knew them both decided to call him by his middle name whenever he was with Seamus which stuck.
His first job was as a milkman with [[St. Cuthbert's Co-operative Society]].<ref>[http://heritage.scotsman.com/greatscots.cfm?id=2275262005 From the Co-op with love.. the days Sir Sean earned £1 a week]</ref> He then joined the [[Royal Navy]] but was later [[Military discharge|discharge]]d on medical grounds (stomach [[ulcer]]). He briefly returned to the Co-op, then went on to a succession of jobs, including truck driver, [[labourer]], [[Model (art)|artist's model]] for the [[Edinburgh College of Art]]<ref>[http://news.scotsman.com/entertainment.cfm?id=924382003 Even as an unknown, Sean was still a draw]</ref> and [[lifeguard]]. 

Under the name Thom Connery, he placed third in the tall man's division of the 1953 [[Mr. Universe]] contest.  Another competitor, Johnny Isaacs, suggested that he try out for a stage production of ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'', which led to work on the stage, TV, and eventually in films. One prominent television role came in [[Rudolph Cartier]]'s 1961 production of ''[[Anna Karenina]]'' for [[BBC Television]], in which Connery co-starred with [[Claire Bloom]].<ref name="karenina">{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/1181098/index.html|title=Cartier, Rudolph (1904&ndash;1994)|first=Oliver|last=Wake|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|accessdate=2007-02-25}}</ref>
He was also in ''[[Darby O'Gill and the Little People]]'' (1956) starring Albert Sharpe.

===James Bond (1962-1967, 1971, 1983)===
Connery, best known to audiences around the world for his role as [[James Bond]], has appeared as Bond in seven films, beginning with ''Dr. No'' in 1962, and concluding with ''Never Say Never Again'' in 1983. In all, the Connery-Bond films are: 
*''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' ([[1962 in film|1962]])
*''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia With Love]]'' ([[1963 in film|1963]])
*''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' ([[1964 in film|1964]])
*''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' ([[1965 in film|1965]])
*''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'' ([[1967 in film|1967]])
*''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' ([[1971 in film|1971]])
*''[[Never Say Never Again]]'' ([[1983 in film|1983]])  (Non-series Bond Film)
[[Image:007Connery.jpg|thumb|right|Sean Connery as 007 in ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'']]
The physically imposing, yet light-footed Connery was discovered by [[Harry Saltzman]], after numerous names as possible contenders for Bond were ruled out or unavailable, including most notably [[David Niven]], who later parodied Bond in the 1967 spoof ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]'', and [[Cary Grant]] (who was said to have been part of the inspiration for Bond), who was ruled out after committing to only one film; some sources also suggest that Grant, at 58, turned the role down feeling he was too old for the part. [[James Mason]] was also considered for the role. He shares the same problem as Grant did. Due to the relatively small budget, the producers were forced to go with an unknown, and Connery was cast partly for that reason.

[[Ian Fleming]], the creator of James Bond, reportedly had doubts about the casting, on the grounds that the muscular, 6'2" Scotsman was too 'unrefined', but a female companion of Fleming's told him that Connery had 'it.' Fleming said, "He's not what I envisioned of James Bond looks." The author later changed his mind after ''Dr. No'' premiered and he was so favourably impressed that he introduced a half-Scottish (and half-Swiss) heritage for his character in subsequent Bond novels. 

Connery's on-screen portrayal of Bond was a result partly of tutelage from director [[Terence Young]], who helped to smooth over Connery's rough edges, while utilizing his physical presence and graceful movements during action sequences.  [http://www.hmss.com/films/young.htm Robert Cotton] wrote in one Connery biography that [[Lois Maxwell]] (who played the first [[Miss Moneypenny]]) noticed, "Terence took Sean under his wing. He took him to dinner, showed him how to walk, how to talk, even how to eat." Cotton said, "Some cast members remarked that Connery was simply doing a Terence Young impression, but Young and Connery knew they were on the right track."

In June 1967, following the unsatisfying and intrusive experience of filming ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'', Connery quit the role, having grown tired of the repetitive plots, lack of character development, and the general public's growing demands on him and his privacy (as well as a fear of being [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]]). 

He also stated that he did not like the direction in which the Bond series was heading, feeling that the filmmakers were straying too far from the source material. 

The producers hired [[George Lazenby]] to take over the role in [[1969 in film|1969]]'s ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]''. However, Lazenby backed out of a seven-film contract, and quit before the film was even released. His performance met with a mixed response from fans and critics, but was by no means the financial flop that it has since been portrayed as. 

Connery was enticed back by United Artists president David Picker in 1970 for £1.25 million — at the time, a record salary for an actor: he donated the entire sum to charity. Thus, Connery made his final 'official' appearance as the secret agent in [[1971 in film|1971]]'s ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]''. He allegedly declined £5 million to make a further Bond picture in 1973 [[Live And Let Die]].

As a result of a complex deal between [[EON Productions]] and [[Kevin McClory]] (producer of ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' and co-creator of the story idea that was used for [[Ian Fleming]]'s novel), the latter was given the right to create a remake of ''Thunderball'' in 1978. McClory instead teamed with Connery to write a completely original James Bond film, potentially entitled either ''James Bond Of The Secret Service'' or ''Warhead'', but the proposal was blocked by lawsuits brought by EON and [[United Artists]]. 

However, the 'remake' project was revived in the 1980s, and Connery signed to play Bond for the seventh and final time on film in the unofficial film ''[[Never Say Never Again]]''. The generic title of the film has long been believed to have derived from Connery's comments after the release of ''Diamonds Are Forever''. After filming it, he asserted that he would never play James Bond again. (For the legal battle, see [[Thunderball (film)#The controversy over the novel|the controversy of ''Thunderball'']])

Connery reprised the role once more in 2005, providing the voice and likeness of James Bond for the [[Computer and video games|video game]] adaptation of ''[[From Russia with Love (video game)|From Russia With Love]]''.

Connery's favorite Bond film is ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia With Love]]'', one of the most acclaimed in the series. He confirmed this in a 2002 interview with [[Sam Donaldson]] for ABCNews.com. ([[American Movie Classics]] erroneously listed ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' as Connery's favorite during its recent Bond retrospectives.)

Over 40 years after he first played the role, Connery is still widely regarded as the definitive cinematic incarnation of James Bond, despite popular interpretations by the likes of [[Roger Moore]], [[Pierce Brosnan]] and [[Timothy Dalton]], the latter often considered closer to the Bond of the novels. Connery's own feelings on Bond in interviews have run the gamut from bitter resentment to great fondness. At one point, he said that he hated the Bond character so much that he'd have killed him, but he has also stated that he never hated Bond, but merely wanted to pursue other roles. Certainly, when the James Bond series was at its peak in the mid-1960s, his association with the 007 image was so intense that different performances in his non-Bond films, such as [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'', ''[[A Fine Madness]]'', and [[Sidney Lumet]]'s ''[[The Hill (film)|The Hill]]'', were virtually ignored. When asked if he'd ever escape the identification, he replied, "Never. It's with me till I go in the box."

At another point, Connery stated that he still cared about the future of the character and franchise, having been associated with the icon for too long not to care, and that all Bond films had their good points. In December 2005, Connery voiced his support for [[Daniel Craig]], the latest actor chosen to play Bond, for ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]''.

===Post-James Bond career===
Although his most famous role was that of Bond, Sean Connery has also maintained a successful career since, much more so than any of the other actors who assumed the role. As part of the agreement to appear in ''Diamonds are Forever'', Connery was given carte blanche to produce two films for United Artists but felt that the only film made under this deal, ''[[The Offence]]'', was buried by the studio. Apart from ''[[The Man Who Would Be King (film)|The Man Who Would Be King]]'', most of Connery's successes in the next decade were as part of ensemble casts, in films such as ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]]'' and ''[[A Bridge Too Far (1977 film)|A Bridge Too Far]]'' (in which he acted in a scene opposite [[Sir Laurence Olivier]]).  His portrayal of Berber chieftain [[Mulai Ahmed er Raisuli]] in [[John Milius]]'s ''[[The Wind and the Lion]]'' (1975) gained him considerable acclaim from critics and audiences and showed his range as an actor. After his experience with ''Never Say Never Again'' and the following court case, Connery became unhappy with the major studios and for two years did not make any films. 

Following the successful European production ''[[The Name of the Rose (film)|The Name of the Rose]]'', for which he won a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] award, Connery's interest in more credible material was revived. That same year, a supporting role in ''[[Highlander (film)|Highlander]]'' showcased his ability to play older, wise mentors to young, leading protagonists, which would become a recurring role in many of his later films. The following year, his acclaimed performance as a hard-nosed cop in ''[[The Untouchables (1987 film)|The Untouchables]]'' (1987) earned him an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. 

Subsequent box-office hits such as ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' (1989) (in which he played the father of Harrison Ford, actually only 12 years his junior), ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]'' (1990), ''[[The Rock (film)|The Rock]]'' (1996), and ''[[Entrapment (film)|Entrapment]]'' (1999) re-established him as a bankable leading man. Both ''Last Crusade'' and ''The Rock'' alluded to his James Bond days. Steven Spielberg and George Lucas wanted "the father of Indy" to be Connery since Bond directly inspired the Indiana Jones series, while his character in ''The Rock'', John Patrick Mason, was a British secret service agent imprisoned since the 1960s. In more recent years, Connery's filmography has included its fair share of box office and critical disappointments such as ''[[The Avengers (film)|The Avengers]]'' (1998) and ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (film)|The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' (2003), but he also received positive reviews for films including ''[[Finding Forrester]]'' (2000). He also later received a [[Crystal Globe]] for outstanding artistic contribution to world cinema. 

In September 2004, media reports indicated that Connery intended to retire after pulling out of ''[[Josiah's Canon]]'', which was set for a [[2005]] release. However, in a December 2004 interview with ''[[The Scotsman]]'' newspaper from his home in the [[Bahamas]], Connery explained he had taken a break from acting in order to concentrate on writing his [[autobiography]]. However, the book project was later abandoned because the publishers wanted to probe too deeply into his private life.  

In July 2005, shortly before his 75th birth anniversary, it was reported in the broadcast media (and again in ''The Scotsman''[http://news.scotsman.com/entertainment.cfm?id=1707662005]), that he had decided to retire from film making following disillusionment with the "idiots now in Hollywood", and the turmoil involved in the making and subsequent box office failure of the 2003 film ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen#Adaptations|The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]].'' He stated in interviews for the film included on the DVD release that he was offered roles in both ''[[The Matrix]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|The Lord of the Rings]]'' series, declining both owing to "not understanding them", and after they went on to have huge box office grosses he decided to accept the ''League'' role despite not "understanding" it either.

At the [[Tartan Day]] celebrations in [[New York]] in March 2006, Connery again confirmed his retirement from acting, and stated that he is now writing a history book.

As a personality he has been accused of being an overbearing bully but has also been praised as a highly professional actor, courteous and supportive of those around him. He made a big impression on actors such as [[Harrison Ford]], [[Kevin Costner]], Pat Adams, and [[Christopher Lambert]], who considered him a great friend during filming. 

He was planning to star in an $80 million movie about [[Saladin]] and the [[Crusades]] that would be filmed in [[Jordan]] before the producer [[Moustapha Akkad]] was killed in the [[2005 Amman bombings]]. Connery received the [[American Film Institute]]'s Lifetime Achievement Award on [[8 June]] [[2006]], where he again confirmed his retirement from acting. However, in January 2007,  Connery told ''The Scotsman'' that he would join the cast of the fourth ''Indiana Jones'' film if he likes the script.

===Personal life===

Connery was married to the [[Australia|Australian-born]] actress [[Diane Cilento]] from 1962 until 1973 (he was her second husband). They have one son, [[Jason Connery]] (born [[January 11]], [[1963]]), who was educated at [[Millfield School]] in [[Somerset]], [[England]], and the rigorous [[Gordonstoun]] boarding school in Scotland, before going on to become an actor. According to Jason, his parents' divorce was an extremely bitter and painful affair (Diane Cilento has reportedly just written an autobiography that paints an unflattering portrait of her ex-husband). In 1975, Sean Connery married [[France|French]] artist [[Micheline Roquebrune]], who is the grandmother of French television journalist [[Stéphanie Renouvin]].

====Accusations of Abuse====
*In her autobiography [http://entertainment1.sympatico.msn.ca/Celebs/Bang/ContentPosting.aspx?newsitemid=BSBS40342&feedname=BANG&show=False&number=0&showbyline=False&subtitle=&detect=&abc=abc My Nine Lives] and subsequent interviews on radio and in print ''[http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=652&id=1993262005 The Scotsman]'' [[Diane Cilento]] alleged that Connery had beaten her on several occasions, accusations that Connery denied.

*He caused an uproar in a December 1987 interview with [[Barbara Walters]] in which he said it was OK for a man to slap a woman with limited force, assuming that it was required to calm her down or "keep her in line." ( see the video here. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FgMLROTqJ0 interview]) Connery had made similar remarks in a November 1965 interview with ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine on the set of ''Thunderball''.
*In ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' in 1993 he said: "There are women who take it to the wire. That's what they are looking for, the ultimate confrontation. They want a smack."

===Political causes===
[[Image:ConneryKilt.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Sean Connery at a [[Tartan Day]] celebration in [[Washington D.C.]]]]
Connery has long supported the [[Scottish National Party]], a political party campaigning for [[Scottish independence]], both financially and through personal appearances. His involvement in [[Scottish politics]] has attracted adverse criticism, as he has not resided on a permanent basis in Scotland for more than fifty years. His support for the SNP is illustrated by a comment from his official website:

{{cquote|While it is generally accepted that his support of Scotland's independence and the Scottish National Party delayed his knighthood for many years, his commitment to Scotland has never wavered. [[Politics of the United Kingdom|Politics in the United Kingdom]] often has more intrigue than a James Bond plot. While Scotland is not yet independent, she does have a [[Scottish Parliament|new parliament]]. Sir Sean campaigned hard for the yes vote during the [[Scotland referendum, 1997|Scottish Referendum]] that created the new [[Scottish Parliament]]. He believes firmly that the Scottish Parliament will grow in power and that Scotland will be independent within his lifetime.|30px|30px|SeanConnery.com on Sean Connery's support of the Scottish National Party|http://www.seanconnery.com/biography/knighthood/}}

Connery used half of his fee from ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' (1971) to establish a [[Charitable organization|charity]] to support deprived children in Edinburgh as well as Scottish [[film production]]. It was suggested in 1997 that the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour government]] had prevented him being knighted for his charitable work because of his support for the SNP. At the time a Labour Party spokesman stated Connery's knighthood had been blocked because of remarks the actor had made in past interviews condoning the physical abuse of women. 

Connery received the ''[[Légion d'honneur]]'' in 1991. He received [[Kennedy Center Honors]] from the [[United States]] in 1999, presented to him by President [[Bill Clinton]]. He received a [[Knight Bachelor|knighthood]] on [[July 5]], [[2000]], wearing a hunting [[tartan]] [[kilt]] of the [[Clan Maclean|MacLean of Duart]] [[Scottish clan|clan]]. He also received the [[Orden de Manuel Amador Guerrero]] from [[Mireya Moscoso]], former president of [[Panama]] on [[11 March]] [[2003]], for his talent and versatility as an actor.

===Health===
In 1993 news that Connery was undergoing [[radiation treatment]] for an undisclosed throat ailment sparked media reports that the actor was suffering from [[throat cancer]] following years of heavy smoking, and he was falsely declared dead by the Japanese and South African news agencies. Connery immediately appeared on the [[David Letterman]] show to deny all of this. In a February 1995 interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', he claimed the radiation treatment was to remove "nodules" from his vocal chords. In 2003 he had surgery to remove [[cataracts]] from both eyes. On [[March 12]], [[2006]], he announced he was recovering from surgery to remove a kidney tumour in January.

===Parodies===

Connery's distinctive speaking voice has sometimes made him a target of satire, most notably in the recurring ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketch "[[Celebrity Jeopardy! (Saturday Night Live)|Celebrity Jeopardy!]]" In the sketches, Connery (as portrayed by [[Darrell Hammond]]) taunts and mocks host Alex Trebek (played by [[Will Ferrell]]) and makes numerous lewd references and jokes about women's breasts. Hammond would also play Connery for a fake trailer for a [[live action]] [[Smurfs]] movie, where Connery played [[Papa Smurf]].

Connery's role in ''Finding Forrester'', specifically his line "You're the man now, dog!", became the inspiration for the popular website [[YTMND.com]].

==Trivia==
{{toomuchtrivia}}
{{Unreferenced|date=November 2006}}
*He wore a [[toupee]] in all the James Bond movies. He began losing his hair at 21. Privately and in most other movies, he wears none.

*His first American television role was as a porter in an episode of ''[[The Jack Benny Show]]''.

*Connery was offered a trial for [[Manchester United]] football club, but declined the chance to pursue his acting career.

*In the 1960s, he visited [[Kingsley Hall]] in [[London]], then a commune for diagnosed [[schizophrenic]]s.

*He was voted to have the worst movie accent by ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', for his performance in [[The Untouchables (1987 film)|The Untouchables]]. He has been derided, but also applauded, for using the same accent for every character, despite playing roles as diverse as an [[Irish American]] Chicago cop (''[[The Untouchables]]''), the [[Norman language|Norman French]] speaking [[Richard I of England]] (''[[Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves]]''), and a [[Lithuania|Lithuanian]] Soviet submarine captain (''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]'').<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/3032052.stm Connery "has worst film accent"]</ref>

* Connery had been the original choice for ''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1968 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]'' (1968) but declined, a decision he later regretted. The role went to [[Steve McQueen]]. Interestingly, in the 1990s remake of the film, Pierce Brosnan plays the character. Brosnan was the fifth actor to play James Bond.

*[[George Lucas]] has said on multiple occasions that Connery's portrayal of the character [[James Bond]] was one of the primary inspirations for his [[Indiana Jones]] character. As a tribute to this, when casting his third Indiana Jones film, ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade|The Last Crusade]]'', Lucas chose Connery for the role of Indiana's father.

*He is the honorary chairman of the [[Friends of Scotland]] organisation.

*[[Ian Fleming]], the author of the James Bond novels and movies, initially had reservations about the casting of Sean Connery for the first James Bond film, saying Connery was "too unrefined." However, Fleming would later change his mind, and say that Connery was ideal for the role.

*Allegedly, while filming the movie, ''[[Another Time, Another Place (film)|Another Time, Another Place]]'', [[Lana Turner]] was rumoured to have been having an affair with Connery, her co-star. [[Johnny Stompanato]] stormed onto the set, and during a verbal altercation with Connery, Stompanato waved a gun in Connery's face. Connery reacted by taking the gun away from him, physically beating Stompanato and sending him off the film set. After Stompanato's death, there were rumours that [[organized crime]] mobsters believed Connery had helped bring on the eventual demise of Stompanato, and Connery is alleged to have laid low for a time. There is no evidence that Connery and Turner were having an affair; this sort of behaviour was apparently normal for Stompanato.[http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/famous/lana_turner/6.html] [http://www.total-movies.com/content_pages/000710_a.asp] [http://www.freeinfodirectory.com/Movies/Who_Is_James.htm] [http://www.granta.com/extracts/2144]

*In 1987-88, Connery was attached to star in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[television series]] ''[[Red Dwarf]]'', which was ultimately a [[sitcom]] that blended elements of [[science fiction]] with [[comedy]] (similar to ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to The Galaxy]]''). Connery was to appear as the [[captain]] of the [[spaceship]] ''[[Red Dwarf ships#Red Dwarf|Red Dwarf]]''. However the role was written in as being slightly overweight and slightly inept, and so with the part being unfitting for Connery it was eventually passed to an American comedic actor, [[Mac McDonald]]. This was revealed in the ''Red Dwarf'' Series I DVD commentary.

*In 1999, Connery was approached to play the role of [[Gandalf]] in "The Lord of the Rings", but he declined

*In 2003 Connery came fourth in a ''[[Herald (Glasgow)|Herald]]'' poll to find [[The Most Scottish Person In The World]].

*Supports Scottish football team [[Celtic FC|Celtic]], though he attends the occasional [[Rangers FC|Rangers]] game due to his close personal friendship with [[David Murray]], the Rangers owner.
