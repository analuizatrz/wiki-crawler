'''Matilda Ziegler''' ([[IPA]]: {{IPA|tsi:gle…ê}}) (born in [[1964]]) is an [[England|English]] [[actor|actress]], known mostly for her work on [[United Kingdom|British]] [[television]], although she is also a veteran [[theatre]] actress.

Her first television role has also been her most notable. She played [[Donna Ludlow]] in the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]], ''[[EastEnders]]'' from 1987 - 1989. During her time on the show, Ziegler's scheming character contended with [[prostitution]], an attempted [[gang rape]], a [[heroin]] addiction and finally [[suicide]] (dying of a heroin overdose). The final death scenes of Ziegler's character, who had choked to death on her own [[vomit]], have been hailed as one of the most powerful anti-drug images ever screened on the programme. 
 
After leaving ''EastEnders'', Ziegler went on to star in the [[ITV]] [[sitcom]], ''[[Mr. Bean]]'', where she played various characters, notably Irma Gobb, the long-suffering girlfriend of Mr. Bean. She guest starred for four episodes.

Other television credits include ''Harbour Lights'' (1999), acting alongside [[Nick Berry]], who also played her love interest, [[Simon Wicks]], in ''EastEnders''; ''[[Where the Heart Is (TV series)|Where the Heart Is]]'' (2000);  ''[[Holby City]]'' (2003); ''[[Casualty (television)|Casualty]]'' and the ITV police drama,  ''[[The Bill]]'' (2003).

Ziegler is more recently known for playing Ruth, the long suffering wife of Toni the car-salesman, in the BBC sitcom, ''[[Swiss Toni]]'' (2003-2004). She has also starred in the [[British Academy Television Awards|British Academy Television Award]] winning drama, ''[[Sex Traffic]]'' (2004). Most recently Ziegler played Christine Marshall in the fourth series of ''[[The Inspector Lynley Mysteries]]'' (2005).
