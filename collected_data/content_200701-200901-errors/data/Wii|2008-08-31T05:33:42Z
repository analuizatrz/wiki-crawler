==History==
The console was conceived in 2001, as the [[Nintendo GameCube]] was first seeing release. According to an interview with Nintendo's game designer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], the concept involved focusing on a new form of player interaction. "The consensus was that power isn't everything for a console. Too many powerful consoles can't coexist. It's like having only ferocious [[dinosaur]]s. They might fight and hasten their own extinction."<ref name="Miyamoto Speaks">{{cite web|url= http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/nov2006/tc20061116_750580.htm|title=The Big Ideas Behind Nintendo's Wii |accessdate=2007-02-02|publisher=BusinessWeek|author=Kenji Hall}}</ref>

Two years later, [[game engine|engineers]] and [[game designer|designers]] were brought together to develop the concept further. By 2005, the controller interface had taken form, but a public showing at that year's [[E3 Media and Business Summit|E3]] was withdrawn. Miyamoto stated that, "[W]e had some troubleshooting to do. So we decided not to reveal the controller and instead we displayed just the console."<ref name="Miyamoto Speaks" /> Nintendo president [[Satoru Iwata]] later unveiled and demonstrated the [[Wii Remote]] at the September [[Tokyo Game Show]].<ref name="TGSspeech" />

The [[Nintendo DS]] is said to have influenced the Wii design. Designer Ken'ichiro Ashida noted, "We had the DS on our minds as we worked on the Wii. We thought about copying the DS's touch-panel interface and even came up with a prototype." The idea was eventually rejected, with the notion that the two gaming systems would be identical. Miyamoto also expressed that, "[I]f the DS had flopped, we might have taken the Wii back to the drawing board."<ref name="Miyamoto Speaks" />

Nintendo has attributed the success of the Wii to the ideas presented in the business strategy book ''[[Blue Ocean Strategy]]''.<ref>{{cite news| last =Fils-Aime | first =Reggie | title =Perspective: Nintendo on the latest 'technical divide'| work = Nintendo| publisher =[[CNET]]| date =[[2007-05-09]]| url =http://news.com.com/Nintendo+on+the+latest+technical+divide/2010-1041_3-6180215.html | accessdate =2007-10-29}}</ref> Within the context of a Blue Ocean Strategy analysis, the key factors of the Wii reflect the Six Path Framework described within the book. While Nintendo has not publicly released the factors used, it is believed that they include "price", "movie playing", "graphics", "physics", "fun", "game library", and "magic wand". Applying the Four Actions Framework would eliminate movie playing, reduce graphics and physics, raise fun and the game library, and lead to the creation their "magic wand": the Wii Remote.<ref>[http://www.valueinnovation.net/2008/04/nintendo-wii-blue-ocean-strategy.html Nintendo Wii Blue Ocean Strategy Analysis]</ref>

===Name===
<!--DO NOT ADD a reference to urine to this article. If you think it needs to be added, please discuss it on the talk page.-->
The console was known by the [[code name]] of "'''Revolution'''" until April 27, 2006, immediately prior to [[E3 Media and Business Summit|E3]].<ref name="revolution renamed to wii">{{cite web|url=http://www.consolewatcher.com/2006/05/nintedo-revolution-renamed-to-nintendo-wii/|publisher=Console Watcher|work=Console Watcher|title=Nintendo Revolution Renamed To Nintendo Wii|accessdate=2006-11-03}}</ref> According to the Nintendo Style Guide, the name "is simply Wii, not Nintendo Wii." This means it is the first home console Nintendo has marketed outside of Japan without the company name featured in its trademark. While "Wiis" is a commonly used [[plural noun|pluralization]] of the console, Nintendo has stated that the official plural form is "Wii systems" or "Wii consoles."<ref name="The plural of Wii">{{cite news|publisher=Nintendo|url= http://gonintendo.com/?p=7288|title=The Plural of Wii|accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref> Nintendo's spelling of "Wii" with two lower-case "i" characters is meant to resemble two people standing side by side, representing players gathering together, as well as to represent the Wii Remote and Nunchuk.<ref name="introducing_wii"/> The company has given many reasons for this choice of name since the announcement; however, the best known is:

===Demographic===
Nintendo hopes to [[target market|target]] a wider [[demographic profile|demographic]] with its console than that of others in the [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|seventh generation]].<ref name="USA Today" /> At a press conference for the upcoming [[Nintendo DS]] game ''[[Dragon Quest IX: Defenders of the Sky|Dragon Quest IX]]'' in December 2006, [[Satoru Iwata]] insisted "We're not thinking about fighting [[Sony]], but about how many people we can get to play games. The thing we're thinking about most is not portable systems, consoles, and so forth, but that we want to get new people playing games."<ref name="IwataSony">{{cite web|title=Dragon Quest IX Q&A|date=2006-12-12|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2006-12-16|url= http://ds.ign.com/articles/750/750610p1.html}}</ref>

This is reflected in Nintendo's series of [[television advertisement]]s in North America, directed by [[Academy Award]] winner [[Stephen Gaghan]], as well as Internet ads. The ad slogans are ''"Wii would like to play"'' and ''"Experience a new way to play''." These ads ran starting November 15, 2006 and had a total budget of over [[United States dollar|US$]]200&nbsp;million throughout the year.<ref>joystiq.com [http://www.joystiq.com/2006/11/12/nintendo-wii-marketing-to-exceed-200-million/ "Nintendo Wii Marketing To Exceed 200 million"] (November 12, 2006)</ref> The productions are Nintendo's first broad-based advertising strategy and include a two-minute [[video clip]] showing a varied assortment of people enjoying the Wii system, such as urban apartment-dwellers, country ranchers, grandparents, and parents with their children. The music in the ads is from the song "Kodo (Inside the Sun Remix)" by the [[Yoshida Brothers]].<ref name="jap_commercial">{{cite web|title=Wii For All - Wii Would Like To Play|date=2006-12-10|publisher=The Inspiration Room Daily|accessdate=2007-01-16|url= http://theinspirationroom.com/daily/2006/wii-for-all}}</ref> The marketing campaign has proved to be successful: [[pensioner]]s as old as 103 have been reported to be playing the Wii in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|last=Parker|first=Andrew|title=OAPs say nurse, I need a Wii|publisher=The Sun|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2007420867,00.html|date=2007-09-14|accessdate= 2007-09-14}}</ref> A report by the British newspaper ''[[The People]]'' also stated that [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] of Great Britain has played using the console.<ref>{{cite web|title=MAKE WAY FOR THE Q Wii N|publisher=The People|url=http://www.people.co.uk/news/tm_headline=make-way-for-the-q-wii-n%26method=full%26objectid=20276099%26siteid=93463-name_page.html|date=2008-01-06}}</ref>

The Wii is Nintendo's smallest home console to date; it measures 44&nbsp;[[millimetre|mm]] (1.73&nbsp;[[inch|in]]) wide, 157&nbsp;mm (6.18&nbsp;in) tall and 215.4&nbsp;mm (8.48&nbsp;in) deep in its vertical orientation, the near-equivalent of three [[keep case|DVD cases]] stacked together. The included stand measures 55.4&nbsp;mm (2.18&nbsp;in) wide, 44&nbsp;mm (1.73&nbsp;in) tall and 225.6&nbsp;mm (8.88&nbsp;in) deep. The system weighs 1.2&nbsp;[[kilogram|kg]] (2.7&nbsp;[[pound (mass)|lb]]),<ref name="WiiWeight">{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,127859-page,1/article.html|title=A Closer Look at the Nintendo Wii}} pcworld.com. Retrieved on March 8, 2007.</ref> which makes it the lightest of the three major [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|seventh generation]] consoles. The console can be placed either horizontally or vertically. The prefix for the numbering scheme of the system and its parts and accessories is "RVL-" after its [[project code name]] of "Revolution".<ref>{{cite news|title=Wii controller world tour|pages=8|publisher=[[Ngamer]]|date= July 13, 2006|url=<!--add web archive if available-->|accessdate=2007-01-01}}</ref> The console also features a recurring theme or design: the console itself, [[Secure Digital card|SD cards]], the power supply and all the sockets have one of their corners chipped off in a triangular fashion.

The front of the console features an illuminated slot-loading optical media drive that accepts both 12&nbsp;cm [[Nintendo optical disc|Wii Optical Discs and Nintendo GameCube Game Discs]]. The blue light in the disc slot illuminates briefly when the console is turned on and pulsates when new data is received through [[WiiConnect24]]. After firmware update 3.0, the disc slot light activates whenever a Wii disc is inserted or ejected. When there is no WiiConnect24 information, the light stays off. The disc slot light remains off during gameplay or when using other features. Two [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] ports are located at its rear. An SD card slot hides behind the cover on the front of the console. The SD card can be used for uploading photos as well as backing up [[saved game]] data and downloaded [[Virtual Console]] games. To use the SD slot for transferring game saves, an [[patch (computing)|update]] must be installed. An installation can be initiated from the Wii options menu through an Internet connection, or by inserting a game disc containing the updated firmware. Virtual Console data cannot be restored to any system except the unit of origin.<ref name="Nintendo Forums: SD CARD ISSUE (from one system to another)">{{cite web|url= http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/wii/en_na/data.jsp#SDcopy|title=Nintendo Customer Service: Copy Data to an SD Card |accessdate=2008-05-14}}</ref> An SD card can also be used to create customized in-game music from stored [[MP3]] files, as first shown in ''[[Excite Truck]]'', as well as music for the [[slideshow]] feature of the [[Wii Menu#Photo Channel|Photo Channel]]. Version 1.1 of the Photo Channel removed MP3 playback in favor of [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] support.

Nintendo plans to release a version of the console with [[DVD-Video]] playback capabilities. This new model will use the CinePlayer CE DVD Navigator [[software engine]] by [[Sonic Solutions]].<ref name="DVD-Wii 2007" /> Although software will be used to enable DVD-Video functionality, Nintendo has stated that it "requires more than a firmware upgrade" to implement and that the functionality would be unavailable as an upgrade option for the existing Wii model.<ref name="DVD-Wii 2007">{{cite web|url=http://biz.gamedaily.com/industry/feature/?id=14430|title=GameDaily BIZ: Confirmed: Nintendo to Release DVD-Enabled Wii in 2007|accessdate=2006-11-14|date=2006-11-13}}</ref> After announcing the DVD version for 2007, Nintendo delayed its release to focus on producing the original console to meet demand.<ref name="No DVD-Wii 2007">{{cite web |url=http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2007/11/09/wii_dvd_playback_delayed/ |title=Nintendo confirms Wii DVD support coming |accessdate=2007-11-28 |last=Sherwood |first=James |date=2007-11-09|work=[[The Register|Register]] Hardware |publisher=Situation Publishing}}</ref>

[[Image:Wiimote-lite2.JPG|thumb|right|200px|From left to right: [[Nintendo DS Lite]], [[Wii Remote#Nunchuk|Nunchuk]], [[Wii Remote]] and [[Wii Remote#Strap|strap]]]]
The Wii Remote<!--SEE DISCUSSION ON "WIIMOTE"--> is the primary [[game controller|controller]] for the console. It uses a combination of built-in [[accelerometer]]s and [[infrared]] detection to sense its position in [[three-dimensional space|3D]] space when pointed at the [[light-emitting diode|LEDs]] within the [[Wii Remote#Sensing|Sensor Bar]]. This design allows users to control the game using physical gestures as well as traditional button presses. The controller connects to the console using [[Bluetooth]] and features [[Haptic#Games|rumble]] as well as an internal speaker. The Wii Remote can connect to expansion devices through a [[proprietary]] port at the base of the controller. The device bundled with the Wii retail package is the [[Wii Remote#Nunchuk|Nunchuk]] unit, which features an accelerometer and a traditional [[analog stick]] with two trigger buttons.<!--FURTHER INFO ATTACHMENTS SHOULD BE ADDED TO "WII REMOTE" ARTICLE--> In addition, an attachable [[Wii Remote#Strap|wrist strap]] can be used to prevent the player from unintentionally dropping or throwing the Wii Remote.

===Technical specifications===
Nintendo has released few technical details regarding the Wii system, but some key facts have leaked through the press. Though none of these reports has been officially confirmed, they generally point to the console as being an extension or advancement of the [[Nintendo GameCube]] architecture. More specifically, the reported analyses state that the Wii is roughly 1.5 to 2 times as powerful as its predecessor. <ref name="Wii: The Total Story" /><ref name="IGN Wii FAQs">{{cite web|last=Casamassina| first=Matt|url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/733/733464p7.html|title=IGN's Nintendo Wii FAQ|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2006-11-11}}</ref> Based on the leaked specifications, the Wii is the least powerful of the major home consoles in its generation.  The Wii uses a storage system similar to the GameCube, which uses "block" units rather than bytes.  The conversion from blocks to bytes is roughly 8.12 blocks to one megabyte.

===Technical issues===
The first [[Wii System Software]] update via WiiConnect24 caused a very small portion of launch units to become [[Brick (electronics)|completely unusable]]. This forced users to either send their units to [[Nintendo]] for repairs (if they wished to retain their saved data) or exchange it for a free replacement.<ref name="Wii Firmware down">{{cite web|url= http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=149572|title=Wii Connect 24 Kills Wiis|publisher= ComputerAndVideoGames.com}}</ref>

With the release of dual-layer Wii Optical Discs, Nintendo of America has stated that some Wii systems may have difficulty reading the high-density software due to a contaminated laser lens. Nintendo is offering a free repair for owners who experience this issue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/repair/repair_form_us_ssbb.jsp|title=Repair Form for U.S. Residents|accessdate=2008-03-11|author=Nintendo of America|publisher=[[Nintendo of America]]}}</ref><ref name="BRAWLERROS">{{cite web|url=http://gonintendo.com/?p=40081|title=Brawl disc read errors return, but this time it’s Mario Kart}}</ref>

The Wii Remote can lose track of the Wii system that it has been set to, requiring that it be reset and resynchronized. Nintendo's support website provides instructions for this process and to troubleshoot related issues.<ref>[http://support.nintendo.com/ Nintendo support website]</ref>

The Wii Menu [[operating system]] interface is designed around the concept of [[television channel]]s. Separate channels are graphically displayed in a grid and are navigated using the pointer capability of the [[Wii Remote]]. It is possible to change the arrangement of the channels by holding down the A and B buttons. There are six primary channels: <!--BOLDING CHANNELS IS NOT NEEDED-->the Disc Channel, Mii Channel, Photo Channel, Wii Shop Channel, Forecast Channel, and News Channel. The latter two were initially unavailable at launch, but activated through firmware updates. Additional channels are available for download from the [[Wii Shop Channel]] through [[WiiWare]] and also appear with each [[Virtual Console]] title. These include the [[Everybody Votes Channel]], [[Internet Channel]], [[Check Mii Out Channel]], and the [[Wii_Menu#Nintendo_Channel|Nintendo Channel]].<!--FURTHER INFO SHOULD BE ADDED IN THE "WII MENU" ARTICLE-->

===Backward compatibility===

<!--- Wii Download Games Should NOT Be Mixed With Launch Titles --->
The Wii console is [[backward compatibility|backward compatible]] with all official [[Nintendo GameCube]] software, as well as Nintendo GameCube Memory Cards and controllers. Compatibility with software is achieved with the slot-loading drive's ability to accept [[Nintendo optical discs|Nintendo GameCube Game Discs]]. The console supports progressive-scan output in 480p-enabled [[List of GameCube games|GameCube titles]]. Peripherals can be connected via a set of four GameCube controller ports and two Memory Card slots concealed by removable flip-open panels.<ref name="Wii: The Total Story" /> The console therefore retains connectivity with the [[Game Boy Advance]] and [[e-Reader]] through the [[Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Advance Cable|Game Boy Advance Cable]], which is used in the same manner as it was used with the GameCube. This feature can only be accessed on those select GameCube titles that previously utilized it. [[Gamercize]] accessories also utilize the backward compatibility in order to support the Wii console. The Wii set for release in Korea will lack GameCube backward compatibility.<ref>[http://www.gamespot.co.kr/wii/news/0,39051458,39400693-39098642p,00.htm gamespot.co.kr/wii/]</ref>

A Wii console running a GameCube disc is restricted to GameCube functionality. As such, a GameCube controller is required to play GameCube titles, as neither the [[Wii Remote]] nor the [[Wii Remote#Classic Controller|Classic Controller]] functions in this capacity. A Nintendo GameCube Memory Card is also necessary to save game progress and content, as the Wii internal flash memory will not save GameCube games. 

Backward compatibility is limited in some areas. Online and LAN-enabled features for Nintendo GameCube titles are unavailable on the Wii, as the console lacks serial ports for the [[Nintendo GameCube Broadband Adapter|Broadband Adapter]] and [[Nintendo GameCube Modem Adapter|Modem Adapter]]. The console uses a proprietary port for video output and is therefore incompatible with all Nintendo GameCube audio/video cables ([[composite video]], [[S-Video]], [[component video]] and RGB [[SCART]]). The console also lacks the GameCube footprint and high-speed port needed for [[Game Boy Player]] support. The Wii was initially compatible with the GameCube [[Action Replay]], which would work with GameCube titles. The firmware update to 3.0 has caused restrictions to this device along with various unlicensed freeloaders, however.<ref>[http://kotaku.com/gaming/rant/wii-update-breaking-freeloaders-287086.php Wii Update Breaking Freeloaders] [[Kotaku]].

===Nintendo DS connectivity===
The Wii system supports wireless connectivity with the [[Nintendo DS]] without any additional accessories. This connectivity allows the player to use the Nintendo DS microphone and [[touchscreen]] as inputs for Wii games. The first example Nintendo has given of a game using Nintendo DS-Wii connectivity is that of ''[[Pokémon Battle Revolution]]''. Players with either the [[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl|''Pokémon Diamond'' or ''Pearl'']] Nintendo DS games are able to play battles using their Nintendo DS as a controller.<ref name="connectivity returns"/> Nintendo later released the [[Wii Menu#Nintendo Channel|Nintendo Channel]], which allows Wii owners to download [[game demo]]s or additional data to their Nintendo DS in a process similar to that of a [[DS Download Station]].<ref name="Iwata Tech-On 3">{{cite web|author=Naoki Asami| coauthors=Hiroki Yomogita|date=2006-05-25|url=http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20060525/117498/?P=3|title=Regaining what we have lost: Nintendo CEO Iwata's Ambitions for the "Wii"|format=|work=Tech-On!|pages=3|publisher= Nikkei Business Publications|accessdate=2006-06-09}}</ref> The console is also able to expand Nintendo DS games.<ref name="connectivity returns" />

===Online connectivity===
{{main|Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection|WiiConnect24|Internet Channel}}
The Wii console is able to connect to the Internet through its built-in [[IEEE 802.11#802.11b|802.11b]]/[[IEEE 802.11#802.11g|g]] Wi-Fi or through a USB-to-Ethernet adapter, with both methods allowing players to access the established [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]] service.<ref name="Wii: The Total Story" /> [[Wireless LAN Security|Wireless encryption]] by [[Wired Equivalent Privacy|WEP]], [[Wi-Fi Protected Access|WPA]] (TKIP/RC4) and [[IEEE 802.11i|WPA2]] (CCMP/AES) are supported.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/wii/en_na/onlineWirelessRouterChoose.jsp|title=Choosing a Wireless Router |accessdate=2006-12-13|publisher=Nintendo}}</ref> [[AOSS]] support was discreetly added in firmware update 3.0.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ign.com/craig-ign/2007/08/08/62734/#comments|title=Overlooked Wii 3.0 Update Function|accessdate=2007-08-08|publisher=IGN}}</ref> 
Just as for the Nintendo DS, Nintendo does not charge fees for playing via the service<ref name="USA Today">{{cite web|url= http://www.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2006-08-14-nintendo-qa_x.htm |title=Nintendo hopes Wii spells wiinner|accessdate=2006-08-16|date=2006-08-15|publisher=[[USA Today]]}}</ref><ref name="Nintendo Wii Wi-Fi page">{{cite web|author=sjohnson|date=2006-07-18|url=http://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/618959/Secret_Wii_Details_Revealed.html|title=Secret Wii Details Revealed|work= The Feed|publisher=G4|accessdate=2006-07-20}}</ref> and the 12 digit Friend Code system controls how players connect to one another.

One can also connect to the internet with third-party devices.<ref>"Nyko Net Connect," ''Game Informer'' 178 (February 2008): 44.</ref>

The service has several features for the console including the [[Virtual Console]], [[WiiConnect24]], [[Internet Channel]], [[Wii Menu#Forecast Channel|Forecast Channel]], [[Everybody Votes Channel]], [[Wii Menu#News Channel|News Channel]] and the [[Check Mii Out Channel]]. The console can also communicate and connect with other Wii systems through a self-generated wireless [[local area network|LAN]], enabling local wireless multiplayer on different television sets. ''[[Battalion Wars 2]]'' first demonstrated this feature for non-split screen multiplayer between two or more televisions.<ref>[http://wii.ign.com/articles/727/727651p1.html Battalion Wars 2 - Hands On] [[IGN]]. Retrieved on January 25, 2007.</ref>

On April 9, 2008, the [[BBC]] announced that their online [[BBC iPlayer]] would be available on the Wii via the Internet Channel.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/latest/ BBC iPlayer - Latest News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This is only available to people in the UK.

===Parental controls===
The console features [[parental controls]], which can be used to prohibit younger users from playing games with content that would be considered unsuitable for their age level. When one attempts to play a Wii or Virtual Console game, it reads the content rating encoded in the game data; if this rating is greater than the system's set age level the game will not load without a correct override password. The parental controls can also restrict Internet access, which blocks the Internet Channel and system update features. Since the console is restricted to GameCube functionality when playing Nintendo GameCube Game Discs, GameCube software is unaffected by Wii parental control settings.

European units mainly use the [[Pan European Game Information|PEGI]] rating system,<ref name="par_pegi">{{cite news|url= http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/newsArt.cfm?artid=10948|title=Revolution To Feature Parental Controls|publisher=[[Nintendo World Report|Planet GameCube]]|date=2005-11-16}}</ref> whereas North American units use the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]] rating system.<ref name="par_esrb">{{cite press release|url=http://www.nintendo.com/newsarticle?articleid=z5UnNGZpQKWULzG0z8R501PA5IHoNPr2|title=Nintendo Announces Play Control System For Next Hardware|publisher=Nintendo| date=2005-11-16|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070213012428/http://www.nintendo.com/newsarticle?articleid=z5UnNGZpQKWULzG0z8R501PA5IHoNPr2|archivedate=2007-02-13}}</ref> The Wii unit supports the native rating systems of many countries, including [[Computer Entertainment Rating Organization|CERO]] in Japan, the [[Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle|USK]] in Germany, both the [[Pan European Game Information|PEGI]] and [[British Board of Film Classification|BBFC]] in the United Kingdom and the [[Office of Film and Literature Classification (Australia)|OFLC]] in Australia and [[Office of Film and Literature Classification (New Zealand)|New Zealand]].

The worldwide success of the Wii has caught third party developers by surprise, leading to some apologizing for the quality of their early games.
