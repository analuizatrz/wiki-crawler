'''Wesley Kanne "Wes" Clark''' (born [[December 23]], [[1944]]) is a retired [[general|four-star general]] in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]. Clark commanded [[1999 NATO bombing in Yugoslavia|Operation Allied Force]] in the [[Kosovo War]] during his term as the [[Supreme Allied Commander Europe]] of [[NATO]] from 1997 to 2000. He had a distinguished career in the Army and the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], receiving many [[Awards and decorations of the United States military|military decorations]] over the course of his career along with several honorary [[knighthoods]] and a [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]]. Clark was [[valedictorian]] of his class at [[West Point]], was awarded a [[Rhodes scholarship]] to [[Oxford University]] where he earned a [[Masters degree]] in [[Economics]], and later graduated from the [[Command and General Staff College]] with a military Masters degree in [[military science]].

Clark joined the 2004 race for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2004|presidential nomination]] as a [[Draft (politics)|drafted candidate]] on [[September 17]], [[2003]] but withdrew from the primary race on [[February 11]], [[2004]] and continued to actively campaign for eventual Democratic nominee [[John Kerry]]. Clark currently leads a [[political action committee]] "WesPAC: Securing America", which was formed after the primaries,<ref>[http://www.securingamerica.com/ WesPAC - Securing America], P.O. Box 3276, Little Rock, AR 72203. Retrieved [[November 2]] [[2006]].</ref> and used it to support numerous candidates in the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 midterm elections]].<ref>[http://securingamerica.com/taxonomy/term/61 List of all endorsed candidates] from WesPAC - Securing America, P.O. Box 3276, Little Rock, AR 72203. Retrieved [[November 16]] [[2006]].</ref> Clark is also considered a [[Official and potential 2008 United States presidential election Democratic candidates|potential candidate for the Democratic nomination in 2008]], although he has said he is still considering whether or not he will run.

==Early life and education==
Clark's paternal great-grandfather [[Immigration to the United States|immigrated to the United States]] from [[Belarus]] in response the [[Pale of Settlement]] and [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] violence from [[pogrom]]s. Clark's father, Benjamin J. Kanne, had graduated from the [[Chicago-Kent College of Law]] and served in the [[United States Navy Reserve|US Naval Reserve]] as an [[ensign]] during [[World War I]] though was never assigned to a combat mission. Kanne, living in [[Chicago, Illinois]], became involved with politics in the [[1920s]] as a prosecutor and serving in a variety of local offices. He would go on to serve as a delegate to the 1932 [[Democratic National Convention]] held in [[Chicago Stadium]] that nominated [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] for [[President of the United States|president]].<ref>Felix, pgs 7-9.</ref> Kanne came from the [[Kohen]] family line,<ref>Felix, pgs 12-13.</ref> and Clark's son has characterized his grandparent's marriage, between [[Judaism|Jewish]] Benjamin and [[Methodism|Methodist]] Veneta Kanne <ref>[http://www.clark04.com/about/ Clark 2004 biography] by Clark For President. Retrieved [[November 2]] [[2006]].</ref> as "about as multicultural as you could've gotten in 1944."<ref name="AmerSon">[http://a471.g.akamai.net/7/471/9997/v0001/clark.download.akamai.com/9997/preview/AmericanSon_hi.wmv ''American Son''] by Linda Bloodworth. Produced by Linda Burstyn, Cathee Weiss and Douglas Jackson; edited by Gregg Featherman.</ref> 

Clark was born Wesley Kanne in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Illinois]], on [[December 23]], [[1944]]. His father Benjamin died in 1948 when Clark was 4. His mother, Veneta, moved the family to [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]], [[Arkansas]] for a variety of reasons including the greater cost of living in a larger city such as Chicago, Veneta's family that provided support in Little Rock, and a potential lack of closeness with the Kanne family as an outsider to their religion.<ref>Felix, pgs 14-15.</ref> Once in Little Rock Veneta married Viktor Clark, a man Veneta met while working as a secretary for a local bank.<ref>Felix, pg 22.</ref> He was raised assuming Viktor had always been his father and Viktor's adoption of Wesley became official when Wesley was 16, which led him to take his new father's name and become Wesley Kanne Clark. Viktor Clark's name actually replaced Wesley's biological father on his birth certificate, something Wesley would later comment that "they shouldn't have done."<ref>Felix, pg 25.</ref> Veneta raised Clark without telling him of his Jewish ancestry to protect him from the anti-Semitic activities of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in the South at the time, especially from members such as [[Sam Bower]].<ref>Felix pgs 16-17.</ref> Though his mother was Methodist, Clark chose a [[Baptist]] church after moving to Little Rock and continued attending it throughout his childhood.<ref>Felix, pg 21.</ref> He graduated from [[Hall High School (Arkansas)|Hall High School]] with a [[National Merit Scholarship Program|National Merit Scholarship]], and led their [[Swimming|swim]] team to the state championship by filling in for a sick teammate by swimming two legs of a [[Relay race|relay]].<ref name="AmerSon"/><ref>Felix, pg 41.</ref><ref>Felix, pg 52.</ref> Clark has often repeated the [[anecdote]] that he decided he wanted to go to [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] after meeting a [[cadet]] with glasses who told Clark (who wore glasses as well) that one did not need [[Visual acuity|perfect vision]] to attend West Point as Clark had thought.<ref name="AmerSon"/><ref>Felix, pg 49.</ref> Clark applied and received his acceptance letter on [[April 24]], [[1962]].

==Military career==
[[Image:West Point Acceptance Letter.gif|200x|thumb|Clark's acceptance letter to [[United States Military Academy|West Point]].]]
Clark's military career began [[July 2]], [[1962]] when he entered the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York|West Point]], [[New York]]. Clark has said an important influence on his view of the military came from [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s famous [[wikisource:Duty, honor, country|"Duty, honor, country"]] speech to the class of 1962, which graduated months before Clark entered West Point. The speech had been recorded and was played for his class when they first arrived. Clark sat in the "first chair" in many of his classes, a position held by the highest performer in that class. Clark also heavily participated in debate, was consistently within the top 5% of his class as a whole (earning him a "Distinguished Cadet" patch on his uniform), and ultimately graduated [[valedictorian]] of West Point. As valedictorian Clark was first to choose which career field of the Army he would serve in and he selected [[Armoured forces|armor]]. He also met Gertrude Kingston, his future wife, at a [[United Service Organizations|USO]] dance for [[midshipman|midshipmen]] and West Point cadets.<ref>Felix, pgs 54-68.</ref><ref name="AmerSon"/>

Clark had applied for a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] and learned in December of his senior year at West Point that he had been accepted. He spent his summer at the [[United States Army Airborne School]] at [[Fort Benning]]. Clark worked in the [[Philosophy, Politics, and Economics]] (PPE) program, completing his degree at [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]] at the [[University of Oxford]] in August 1968. While at Oxford a Jewish cousin of Clark's, who lived in [[England]], called Clark and informed him of his Jewish heritage (after asking his mother if she would allow it). Clark spent three months after graduation at [[Fort Knox]] going through Armor Officer Basic Course, then went on to [[Ranger School]] at Fort Benning. He was promoted to [[Captain (United States)|captain]] and took his first as commander of the A [[Company (military unit)|Company]] of the 4th Battalion, 68th Armor, [[U.S. 82nd Airborne Division|82nd Airborne Division]] at [[Fort Riley]], [[Kansas]].<ref>Felix, pgs 69-80.</ref>

===Vietnam===
[[Image:Silver Star Citation.gif|200x|thumb|Clark's [[Silver Star]] citation.]]
Clark was assigned a position in the [[U.S. 1st Infantry Division|1st Infantry Division]] and flew to [[Vietnam]] on [[May 21]], [[1969]] during US involvement in the [[Vietnam War]]. He worked as an assistant, collecting data and helping in operations planning, and was awarded the [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]] for his work with the staff. Clark was given command of the A Company, First Battalion, Sixteenth Infantry of the 1st Infantry Division in January 1970. One month into his command, in February, he was shot four times by a [[Viet Cong]] soldier with an [[AK-47]]. After the shots Clark shouted orders to his men, who [[Counterattack|counterattacked]] and defeated the Viet Cong force. Clark had injuries to his right shoulder, right hand, right hip and right leg and was sent to [[Valley Forge Army Hospital]] in [[Phoenixville, Pennsylvania]] to recuperate. He was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for his actions during the encounter.<ref>Felix, pgs 80-84.</ref>

Clark had converted to [[Catholicism]], his wife Gertrude's religion, while in Vietnam. He also first saw his son, Wesley Clark Jr., at the Valley Forge Hospital.<ref>Felix, pgs 85-87.</ref> Clark commanded C Company, 6th Battalion, 32nd Armor, 194th Armored Brigade, a company comprised entirely of injured soldiers, at [[Fort Knox]], [[Kentucky]]. Clark has said this command is what made him decide to continue his military career past the four years required by West Point, which were up in 1971. Clark completed his Armor Officer Advanced Course while at Knox, taking additional elective courses and writing an article that won the Armor Association Writing Award. Clark left Fort Knox and worked in the office of the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army Chief of Staff]] in [[Washington D.C.]] in the "Modern Volunteer Army" program from May to July 1971. He then worked as a social studies instructor at West Point for three years from July 1971 to 1974.<ref name="confirmbio">Detailed resume included with his nomination before the Senate Armed Services Committee, First Session, 105th Congress. July 9th, 1997.</ref><ref>Felix, pgs 88-95.</ref>

Clark graduated from the [[Command and General Staff College]] (CGSC), earning his military [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|Master of Arts]] degree in [[military science]] from the CGSC with a thesis on American policies of [[gradualism]] in the Vietnam War. Clark's theory was one of applying force swiftly and was developed by many soldiers at the time, most famously into the [[Powell Doctrine]]. He was promoted to [[Major (United States)|Major]] upon his graduation from the CGSC.<ref>Felix, pgs. 95-97.</ref>

===Post-Vietnam===
Clark was appointed a [[White House Fellows|White House Fellow]] in the [[Office of Management and Budget]] as a special assistant to [[James Thomas Lynn]]. He was one of only 14 appointed out of 2,307 applicants.<ref>"White House Assigns Fellow to OMB Office," ''Arkansas Democrat-Gazette'', June 29, 1975.</ref> Lynn also gave Clark a six week assignment to assist [[John Otho Marsh, Jr.|John Marsh]], then a counselor to the [[President of the United States|President]]. Clark was approached during his fellowship to help push for a memorial to the Vietnam War. He worked with the movement that ultimately helped lead to the creation of the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]] in [[Washington D.C.]]. Clark took two commands with the [[U.S. 1st Armored Division|1st Armored Division]] based in [[Germany]] from August 1976 to February 1978, first over the 3rd Battalion 35th Armor and then the entire 3rd Brigade.<ref name="confirmbio"/> The battalion commander called Clark the "most brilliant and gifted officer [he'd] ever known" and the brigade commander said Clark was "singularly outstanding, notably superb." He was awarded the [[Meritorious Service Medal (United States)|Meritorious Service Medal]] for his work with the division.<ref>Felix, pgs 97-102.</ref>

The brigade commander had also said that "word of Major Clark's exceptional talent spread", and in one case reached the desk of then [[Supreme Allied Commander]] [[Alexander Haig]]. Haig personally selected Clark to serve as a special assistant on his staff, a post he held from February 1978 to June 1979. While on staff at [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|SHAPE]] Clark wrote policy reports and coordinated two multinational military exercises. Haig wrote a very positive review of Clark, he was promoted to [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]], and was awarded the [[Legion of Merit]]. After his European post he moved on to [[Fort Carson]], [[Colorado]] where he served first as the [[executive officer]] of the 1st Brigade, [[U.S. 4th Infantry Division|4th Infantry Division]] from August 1979 to February 1980 then as the commander of the 1st Battalion, 77th Armor, 4th Infantry Division from February 1980 to July 1982. The commander at Fort Carson had a reputation of disliking West Point graduates and fast rising officers such as Clark. After two years of unexpectedly not making the list to rise from battalion commander to brigade commander, Clark was accepted and attended the [[National War College]]. After studying at the college from June 1982 to 1983 Clark graduated and was promoted to full [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] in October 1983.<ref name="confirmbio"/><ref>Felix, pgs 102-110.</ref>

[[Image:Wesley Clark 1star portrait.JPG|thumb|left|175px|Clark's portrait as a commander at Fort Irwin as a brigadier general]]
Clark worked in Washington D.C. for a time following his graduation, from July 1983 to 1984, in the offices of the full and Deputy [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Chiefs of Staff of the United States Army]] and earned his second Legion of Merit for his work. He then served as the Operations Group commander at [[Fort Irwin Military Reservation]] from August 1984 to June 1986. He was awarded yet another Legion of Merit and a Meritorious Service Medal for his work at Fort Irwin and was then given a brigade command at Fort Carson in 1986. There he commanded the [[3d Brigade 4th Infantry Division|3rd Brigade, 4th Infantry]] from April 1986 to March 1988. Veneta Clark, Wesley's mother, fell ill during his command and died on [[Mother's Day]] in 1986. Clark then returned to the Command and General Staff College to direct and develop the Battle Command Training Program (BCTP) there until October 1989. The BCTP was created to teach senior officers war fighting skills, according to the commanding general at the time. Then on [[November 1]], [[1989]] Clark became a [[flag officer]] with his promotion to [[Brigadier General#United States|Brigadier General]].<ref name="confirmbio"/><ref>Felix, pgs 110-116.</ref>

[[Image:Wesley Clark USSOUTHCOM.JPEG|thumb|right|175px|Once promoted to a full 4-star general, Clark assumed command of USSOUTHCOM in June 1996.]]
Clark returned to Fort Irwin and commanded the National Training Center (NTC) there from October 1989 to 1991. The [[Gulf War]] occurred during Clark's command, and many [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] brigades trained under his command were sent into the war. Multiple generals commanding American forces in [[Iraq]] and [[Kuwait]] said Clark's training helped bring about results in the field and that he had successfully begun training a new generation of the military that had moved past Vietnam-era strategy. He was awarded yet another Legion of Merit for his "personal efforts" that were "instrumental in maintaining" the NTC, according to the citation. He served in yet another planning post after this, serving in as the Deputy Chief of Staff for Concepts, Doctrine, and Developments at [[United States Army Training and Doctrine Command|Training and Doctrine Command]] (TRADOC) at [[Fort Monroe]], [[Virginia]]. There he helped the commanding general of TRADOC prepare the army for war and develop new post-[[Cold War]] strategies. One of Clark's major pushes was for technological advancement in the army to establish a [[Computer network|digital network]] for military command that Clark called the "digitization of the battlefield".<ref>"Digitization: Key to Landpower Dominance," by Wesley Clark for ''Army'' magazine, November 1993.</ref> Clark was promoted to [[Major General#United States|Major General]] in October 1992 at the end of this command.<ref name="confirmbio"/><ref>Felix, pgs 116-120.</ref>

Clark's final divisional command came with the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]] at [[Fort Hood]], [[Texas]]. Clark was in command during three separate deployments of forces from Fort Hood for peacekeeping in Kuwait. His final [[Officer Performance Report]] for his command at Fort Hood called him "one of the Army's best and brightest", Clark was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Medal]] for his work at Fort Hood and was promoted to [[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lieutenant General]] at the end of his command in April 1994. Clark's first assignment was as a J-5 staff member of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] from April 1994 to June 1996, a post discussed in more detail in [[Wesley Clark#The Balkans|the Balkans section below]].<ref name="confirmbio"/><ref>Felix, pgs 120-122.</ref>

Army regulations set a so-called "ticking clock" upon the promotion to a three-star general, essentially requiring that Clark be promoted to another post within 2 years from his initial promotion or retire. This deadline ended in 1996 and Clark said he was not optimistic about receiving such a promotion because rumors at the time suggested General [[Dennis Reimer]] did not want to promote him though "no specific reason was given".<ref name="wmr68">Clark, ''Waging'', pg 68.</ref> General Robert Scales admitted that it was likely Clark's reputation of intelligence within the military was responsible for feelings of resentment against him from other generals. Clark was named to the [[United States Southern Command]] (USSOUTHCOM) post despite these rumors, Congress approved his promotion to full [[General (United States)|General]] in June 1996, and General [[John M. Shalikashvili]] signed the order. Clark said he was not the original nominee but the first officer chosen "hadn't been accepted for some reason."<ref name="wmr68"/><ref>Felix, pgs 131-134.</ref>

===The Balkans===
{{seealso|War in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Dayton Agreement}}
[[Image:Mladic Wesley Clark.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Wesley Clark ''(center, right)'' exchanges hats with [[Ratko Mladić]] ''(center, left)'' in a picture that drew controversy in the United States]]
Clark began planning work for responses to the [[war in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] upon his promotion in 1994 to a J-5 staff member for the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]]. While collecting information to outline military options for resolving the conflict Clark met with [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] military leaders including [[Ratko Mladić]], who was later accused of [[war crimes]] and [[genocide]]. Clark was photographed exchanging hats with Mladić and the photo drew controversy in the United States. A ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' story was published, along with the photo, claiming Clark had made the visit despite a warning from the [[Ambassadors from the United States|U.S. ambassador]].<ref>Clark, ''Waging'', pg 28</ref> Clark had actually listed the visit in the itinerary he submitted to the ambassador, but only learned afterwards that the visit had never been approved. He said there had been no warning and no one had told him to cancel the visit, though two Congressmen called for Clark's dismissal regardless.  Clark later said he regretted the exchange<ref name="confirm">Nominations before the Senate Armed Services Committee, First Session, 105th Congress. July 9th, 1997.</ref> and the issue was ultimately resolved as [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] sent a letter defending Clark to the Congress and the controversy died down.<ref>Felix, pgs 125-126.</ref> Clark would later say it was his "first experience in the rough and tumble of high visibility... and a painful few days."<ref>Clark, ''Waging'', pg 40.</ref>

[[Image:951121 dayton.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Negotiations that led to the signing of the [[Dayton Agreement]] were some of Clark's first experiences with the Balkans.]]
Clark was sent to Bosnia by [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[William Perry]] to serve as the military advisor to a diplomatic negotiating team headed by assisstant [[Secretary of State]] [[Richard Holbrooke]]. Holbrooke would later describe Clark's position as "complicated" because while it presented him with future possibilities it "might put him into career-endangering conflicts with more senior officers."<ref>''To End a War'' by Richard Holbrooke, New York: Random House, 1999, pg. 9.</ref> While the team was driving along a mountain road in the first week the road gave way and one of the vehicles fell over the cliff carrying passengers including Holbrooke's deputy, a deputy assistant Secretary of Defense, and an [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]]. The road was patrolled by [[Serbia|Serbian]] troops known to fire at [[United Nations|U.N.]] vehicles. Clark and Holbrooke attempted to crawl down the mountain, but were driven back by sniper fire. Once the fire ceased Clark [[Abseiling|rappelled]] down the mountain to collect the bodies of two dead Americans left by Bosnian forces that had taken the wounded to a nearby hospital. After returning to Washington D.C. for funeral services the negotiations continued and the team eventually reached the [[Dayton Agreement]] at the [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]] and later signed it in [[Paris]] on [[December 14]], [[1995]].<ref>Felix, pgs. 126-129</ref>

[[Image:Clark Official NATO Portrait.jpg|thumb|right|Clark's official portrait as SACEUR, courtesy of NATO.]]
Clark returned to the European theater and the Balkans following his [[United States Southern Command|USSOUTHCOM]] position when he was appointed to [[U.S. European Command]] in the summer of 1997 by President Clinton. He was, as with SOUTHCOM, not the original nominee for the position, in fact the Army had already selected another general for the post. President Clinton and General Shalikashvili believed Clark was the best man for the post, however, and Clark eventually got the nomination. Shalikashvili noted he "had a very strong role in [Clark's] last two jobs."<ref>"Wesley K. Clark, A Candidate in the Making, Part 2: An Arkansas Alliance and High-Ranking Foes" by Michael Kranish for the Boston Globe on November 17, 2003.</ref> Clark noted during his [[Advice and consent#United States|confirmation hearing]] before the [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services|Senate Armed Services committee]] of the [[105th United States Congress|105th Congress]] that he believed [[NATO]] had shifted since the end of the [[Cold War]] from protecting Europe from the [[Soviet Union]] to working towards more general stability in the region. Clark also addressed issues related to his then-current command of USSOUTHCOM, such as support for the [[Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation|School of the Americas]] and his belief that the United States must continue aid to some [[South America|South American]] nations to effectively fight the [[War on Drugs]].<ref name="confirm"/> Clark was quickly confirmed by a [[voice vote]] the same day as his confirmation hearing,<ref>Nomination: PN382-105 on July 9th, 1997. Retrieved December 14th, 2006 from [http://www.thomas.gov/ Thomas.gov].</ref> giving him the command of 109,000 American troops, their 150,000 family members, 50,000 civilians aiding the military, and all American military activities in 89 countries and territories of [[Europe]], [[Africa]], and the [[Middle East]].<ref>Felix, pg. 137.</ref> The position also made Clark the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|Supreme Allied Commander Europe]] (SACEUR), which granted him overall command of NATO military forces in Europe.

====Kosovo War====
{{seealso|Kosovo War}}
The largest event of Clark's tenure as SACEUR was NATO's confrontation with the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] in the [[Kosovo War]]. The [[United Nations Security Council]] introduced [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1199|Resolution 1199]] calling for an end to hostilities in [[Kosovo]] and Richard Holbrooke again tried to negotiate a peace. This process came to an unsuccessful end, however, following the [[Racak incident]].  [[Madeleine Albright]] then tried to organize another diplomatic solution with the [[Rambouillet Agreement]], which Yugoslavia refused. Clark was at the Rambouillet talks and took Yugoslavian president [[Slobodan Milošević]] aside to try and convince him to agree to peace by telling Milošević "there's an activation order. And if they tell me to bomb you, I'm going to bomb you good." Clark later said Milošević launched into an emotional tirade against [[Albanians]] and said that they'd been "handled" in the 1940s by [[Ethnic cleansing|killing large numbers of them]].<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/kosovo/interviews/clark.html Interview with Wesley Clark] for PBS Frontline.</ref><ref>Felix, pgs. 138-140.</ref> 

[[Image:Clark briefs NATO May 9.JPEG|thumb|left|Clark briefing two fighter squadrons deployed to [[Aviano Air Base]] in [[Italy]] on [[May 9]], [[1999]].]]
Clark ordered bombings codenamed [[1999 NATO bombing in Yugoslavia|Operation Allied Force]] to begin on [[March 24]], [[1999]] in an attempt to enforce UN Resolution 1199 following Yugoslavia's refusal of the Rambouillet Agreement. Secretary of Defense [[William Cohen]] felt that Clark had powerful allies at the [[White House]] such as President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright that were allowing him to circumvent [[The Pentagon]] in promoting his strategic ideas, while Clark felt he was not being included enough in discussions with the [[National Command Authority]] leading Clark to describe himself as "just a NATO officer who also reported to the United States".<ref>Clark, ''Waging'', pg. 342.</ref> This command conflict came to a ceremonial head when Clark was not initially invited to a summit in Washington D.C. to commemorate NATO's 50th anniversary, despite being its supreme military commander. Clark believed Milošević was holding out so long because he felt he could survive a conflict without the threat of ground troops. Clark eventually secured an invitation to the summit, but was told by Cohen to say nothing about ground troops and Clark agreed.<ref>Clark, ''Waging'', pg. 269.</ref>

Clark returned to [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|SHAPE]] following the summit and briefed the press on the continued bombing operations. A reporter from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' asked a question about the effect of bombings on Serbian forces and Clark noted that merely counting the number of opposing troops did not show Milošević's true losses because he was bringing in reinforcements. Many American news organizations capitalized on the remark in a way Clark said "distorted the comment" with headlines such as "NATO Chief Admits Bombs Fail to Stem Serb Operations" in the ''[[New York Times]]''. Clark later defended his remarks, saying this was a "complete misunderstanding of my statement and of the facts" and President Clinton agreed Clark's remarks had been misconstrued. Regardless, Clark recieved a call the following evening from General [[Hugh Shelton]] who said he had been told by Secretary Cohen to deliver a piece of guidance verbatim. "Get your fucking face off the TV. No more briefings, period. That's it."<ref>Clark, ''Waging'', pg. 273.</ref><ref>Felix, pgs. 140-143.</ref>

Operation Allied Force reached another problem when [[NATO Bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade|NATO accidentally bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade]] on [[May 7]], [[1999]]. The operation had been organized against numerous Serbian targets, including "Target 493, the Federal Procurement and Supply Directorate Headquarters", though the intended target building was actually 300 meters away from the targeted area. The embassy was located at this mistaken target and three [[China|Chinese]] journalists were killed. Clark's intelligence officer called Clark taking full responsibility and offering to resign, but Clark declined saying it was not the officer's fault. Secretary Cohen and [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|CIA Director]] [[George Tenet]] took responsibility the next day. Tenet would later explain in testimony before the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]] on [[July 22]], [[1999]] that the targeting system used street addresses which gave inaccurate positions for air bombings and that the various databases of off-limit targets did not have the up-to-date address for the relatively new embassy location.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/cia/public_affairs/speeches/1999/dci_speech_072299.html |title=DCI Statement on the Belgrade Chinese Embassy Bombing House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Open Hearing |accessdate=2006-10-04 |last= Tenet |first= George |authorlink= George Tenet |coauthors= |date=[[1999-07-22]] |year= |month= |format=HTML |work= |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |pages= |language=english |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref><ref>Clark, ''Waging'', pgs. 296-297.</ref>

Milošević's term in office in Yugoslavia was coming to an end and he began enacting a series of policies seen merely as attempts to preserve his power. The elections came on [[September 24]], [[2000]] but protests grew from allegations of fraud and rigged elections that came to a head on October 5th in the so called [[5th October (Serbia)|Bulldozer Revolution]]. Milošević resigned on October 7th, the [[Democratic Opposition of Serbia]] won a majority in parliamentary elections that December, Milošević was taken into custody on [[April 1]], [[2001]], and transferred to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia on June 28 to face charges of [[war crime]]s and [[genocide]]. Clark was called to testify in a closed session of Milošević's trial in December 2003, testifying on issues ranging from the [[Srebrenica massacre]] to conversations Clark had had with Milošević over his career.<ref>Felix, pg. 152.</ref>

Clark received another call from General Shelton in July 1999 in which he was told Secretary Cohen wanted Clark to leave his command in April 2000. Clark was surprised by this as he saw SACEURs as expected to serve at least 3 years and often asked to stay on for a 4th, while this date would give him less than 3 years of service at the post.<ref>Clark, ''Waging'', pg. 408.</ref> Clark was told this was necessary because General [[Joseph Ralston]] was leaving his post as the [[Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] and would need another 4-star command within 60 days or he would be automatically demoted to [[Major General#United States|Major General]]. Ralston was not going to be appointed Chairman of the Joint Chiefs for other reasons and the SACEUR position was said to be the last potential post for him. Clark said this explanation "didn't wash" because he believed the legalities could have been sorted out to let him serve a full 3 years.<ref>Clark, ''Waging'', pg. 409.</ref> Clinton signed onto Ralston's reassignment, though [[David Halberstam]] wrote that both he and Madeleine Albright were angered at Clark's treatment. Clark spent the remainder of his time as SACEUR overseeing peacekeeper forces and, without a new command to take, was forced into retirement from the military on [[May 2]], [[2000]].<ref>[http://www.nato.int/shape/bios/saceur/ralston.htm Ralston's bio] from the NATO website.

==Civilian career==
Clark had earned an average of $40,000 per year over the course of his military career and, according to the ''New York Times'', retired with "precious little in the bank to show for years of public service."<ref>"General Clark and the Hustings: Complexity and Contradiction," ''New York Times'', November 23, 2003.</ref> Clark set himself three initial goals in civilian life - to earn $40 million in the business world to let him practice [[philanthropy]], to become a [[professor]], and to become a [[professional golfer]]. Clark's inspiration for philanthropy came from billionaire [[George Soros]]. Clark began a [[public speaker|public speaking tour]] in the summer of 2000 and approached several former government officials for advice on work after life in government including [[Newt Gingrich]], [[Mack McLarty]], and Richard Holbrooke. Clark took McLarty's advice to move back to [[Little Rock, Arkansas]] and Clark took a position with the Stephens Group, an investment firm headquartered there. He took several other [[Board of directors|board]] positions at defense-related firms and in March 2003 he amicably left the Stephens Group to found Wesley K. Clark & Associates. Clark also began writing, publishing two books - ''Waging Modern War'' and ''Winning Modern War'' - along with writing the [[foreword]]s for a series of military biographies, and writing a series of [[editorial]]s.<ref>[http://securingamerica.com/taxonomy/term/11 Op-Eds] from Securing America. Retrieved January 8th, 2007.</ref> He had only amassed roughly $3.1 million towards his $40 million goal by 2003, but began considering running for public office instead of pursuing his business career.<ref>Felix, pgs 154-173.</ref>

===2004 presidential campaign===
{{seealso|Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2004|United States presidential election, 2004}}
Clark has said that he only began to truly define his politics after his military retirement in 2000 around the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]] that would give [[George W. Bush]] the presidency. Clark actually had a conversation with [[Condoleezza Rice]], Bush's campaign manager and future [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] and Secretary of State. She told him that the war in Kosovo would have never taken place under a Bush administration, as they adhered more to [[realpolitik]]. Clark found such an administration unsettling, as he had been selected for the SACEUR position to begin with because he believed more in the [[Interventionism (politics)|interventionist]] policies of the [[Clinton Administration]]. He said he would see it as a sign that things were "starting to go wrong" with American foreign policy if Bush was elected.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20030807175900/http://stacks.msnbc.com/news/934709.asp?cp1=1 "The Last Word: Wesley Clark] from ''Newsweek''.

Clark continued to warn people as a commentator on  [[CNN]] that he believe the United States were undermanned in Iraq, has said the war was "never [about]... WMD or regime change," and believes "the connection to the War on Terrorism was not shown."<ref>[http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2003/8/23/154853.shtml General Wesley Clark: A Call to Arms] from NewsMax by Dave Eberhart on August 25th, 2003.</ref><ref>Felix, pgs 189-190.</ref>

Clark met with a group of wealthy [[New York]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] including Alan Patricof to tell them he was considering running for the presidency in the 2004 election. Patricof, a supporter of [[Al Gore]] in 2000, met with all the Democratic candidates and ultimately supported Clark in 2004. Clark has said that he voted for Al Gore in 2000, but has voted for Republicans such as [[Ronald Reagan]], held equal esteem for [[Dwight Eisenhower]] and [[Harry Truman]], and had been a registered [[Independent (politician)#United States|independant]] voter throughout his military career. Ultimately as Clark himself put it, however, he decided he was a Democrat because "I was pro-[[affirmative action]], I was [[pro-choice]], I was pro-[[education]]... I'm pro-[[health care]]... I realized I was either going to be the loneliest [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] in America or I was going to be a happy Democrat."<ref name="inhiswords"/> Clark said he liked the Democratic party, which he saw as standing for "internationalism", "ordinary men and women", and "fair play."<ref>"To Find Party, General Marched to His Own Drummer," ''New York Times'', October 5, 2003.</ref><ref>Felix, pgs 190-191.</ref>

A "[[Political draft|Draft]] Clark" campaign began to grow with the launch of DraftWesleyClark.com on [[April 10]], [[2003]].<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20031205012625/clark04.com/drafthistory/ Archived Clark bio] from his 2004 campaign site and Clark for President. Clark For President - P.O. Box 2959, Little Rock, AR 72203. This version is from the Internet Archive on December 5, 2003.</ref> DraftWesleyClark signed up tens of thousands of volunteers, made 150 [[Mass media|media]] appearances discussing Clark, and raised [[United States dollar|$]]1.5 million in [[pledge]]s for his campaign. DraftClark2004.com, another website in support of drafting Clark, was the first organization to register as a [[political action committee]] in June 2003 to persuade Clark to run. They had earlier presented him with 1000 emails in May 2003 from throughout the country asking Clark to run. One of DraftClark2004's founders, Brent Blackaby, said of the draft effort "Just fifty-two years ago citizens from all over the country were successful in [[Draft Eisenhower|their efforts to draft]] General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]]. We intend to do the same in 2004 by drafting General Clark. If he runs, he wins."<ref name="draftclark04">"Draft Clark 2004 for President Committee Files with FEC," US Newswire, June 18, 2003.</ref><ref>Felix, pgs. 191-193.</ref>

Clark spent time during these early stages of the draft movement deciding whether to run, a decision he said was based heavily on deciding whether to expose his family to a presidential campaign. His wife, Gert, said she was "initially... not delighted about it" but later changed her mind after hearing their son Wesley Clark Jr. say that "things have to change, and we're willing to do it. And I want my son to grow up in a different world."<ref>Gertrude Clark interview on C-Span's "American Journal," January 25, 2004.</ref> Clark went on ''[[Meet the Press]]'' in June 2003 and said he was "seriously consider[ing]" running for president.<ref name="draftclark04"/> Clark believes [[Bill Clinton]] also encouraged him to run when he attended a party hosted by the Clintons and Bill Clinton toasted [[Hillary Clinton]] and Clark as the two "stars" of the Democratic party. Clark's repeated connections with Bill Clinton led [[Pundit (expert)|pundits]] to speculate that Clark was being manuvered by the Clintons to change the Democratic field and clear a path for Hillary to enter the race. This theory lasted only a few months and Antonia Felix speculated in her biography of Clark that it came from the largely unexplained connection between Clark and Bill Clinton which led to speculation.<ref>Felix, pgs. 195-196.</ref>

[[Image:Clark logo.bmp|thumb|200px|right|Clark's campaign logo]]
Clark announced his candidacy for the [[U.S. Democratic Party Presidential Primary, 2004|Democratic presidential primary election]] from [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]] on [[September 17]], [[2003]], months after the other candidates. He acknowledged the influence of the Draft Clark movement, saying they "took an inconceivable idea and made it conceivable".<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20031008234745/clark04.com/speeches/001/ Clark's Announcement speech in Little Rock] on September 17, 2003.</ref> Clark's early campaign staff took on many figures prominent in the [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992]] and [[United States presidential election, 1996|1996]] Clinton-[[Al Gore|Gore]] campaigns, including [[Mickey Kantor]]. He also hired one of the founders of DraftWesleyClark.com, John Hlinko, to be his director of Internet strategy. The campaign raised $3.5 million in the first two weeks.<ref>"Wesley Clark Raises More than $3.5M in Fortnight," Forbes, October 6, 2003.</ref><ref>Felix, pgs. 196-197.</ref> The internet campaign would also establish the Clark Community Network of [[blog]]s<ref>[http://securingamerica.com/ccn/ The Clark Community Network] from SecuringAmerica.

Retrieved January 29, 2007.</ref>

Clark, coming from a non-political background, had no position papers to define his agenda for the public. Once in the campaign, however, several volunteers established a network of connections with the media and Clark began to explain his stances on a variety of issues. He was, as he had told the ''[[Washington Post]]'' in October, pro-choice and pro-affirmative action. He also called for a repeal of recent Bush [[tax cut]]s for people earning more than $200,000 and suggested providing healthcare for the uninsured by altering the current system rather than transferring to a completely new [[universal health care]] system. He backed environmental causes such as promising to reverse "scaled down rules" the Bush administration had applied to the [[Clean Air Act|Clean Air]] and [[Clean Water Act]]s and dealing with [[global warming]] by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Clark also proposed a global effort to strengthen American relations with other nations, reviewing the [[USA PATRIOT Act|PATRIOT Act]], and investing $100 billion in [[homeland security]]. Finally, he put out a budget plan that claimed to save $2.35 trillion over ten years through a repeal of the Bush tax cuts, sharing the cost of the [[Iraq War]] with other nations, and cutting government waste.<ref>Felix, pgs. 197-199.</ref> Clark had testified before the [[United States House Committee on Armed Services|House Committee on Armed Services]] on [[September 26]], [[2002]]<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20040121062929/http://armedservices.house.gov/openingstatementsandpressreleases/107thcongress/02-09-26clark.pdf Clark's 2002 testimony] (warning, large file, may be slow to load), from the House Armed Services Committee on September 26, 2002.

Some, such as Clark's biography writer Antonia Felix<ref>Felix, pg 199, "Clark learned that his intellectual style of considering an issue from every angle and ruminating on several alternatives would not serve him well in the sound-bite format of modern political rhetoric."</ref> and the [[Democratic Underground]],<ref>[http://www.democraticunderground.com/articles/04/01/19_clark.html Wesley Clark: Mending our torn country into a nation again] by Jerseycoa on the DemocraticUnderground on January 19, 2004. Retrieved January 28, 2007.</ref>, have speculated that Clark's inexperience at giving [[soundbite]] answers hurt him in the media during his primary campaign. The day after he launched his campaign, for example, he was asked if he would have voted for the Iraq War Resolution which granted President Bush the power to wage the Iraq War, a large issue in the 2004 campaign. Clark said, "At the time, I probably would have voted for it, but I think that's too simple a question," then "I don't know if I would have or not. I've said it both ways because when you get into this, what happens is you have to put yourself in a position - on balance, I probably would have voted for it." Finally, Clark's [[press secretary]] clarified his position as "you said you would have voted for the resolution as leverage for a [[United Nations|UN]]-based solution." After this series of responses, although Clark opposed the war, the ''[[New York Times]]'' ran a story with the headline "Clark Says He Would Have Voted for War".<ref>"Clark Says He Would Have Voted for War," ''New York Times'', September 19, 2003.</ref> Clark was repeatedly portrayed as unsure on this critical issue by his opponents throughout the primary season, being forced to continue to clarify his position such as at the second primary debate when he said, "I think it's really embarrassing that a group of candidates up here are working on changing the leadership in this country and can't get their own story straight... I would have never voted for war. The war was an unnecessary war, it was an elective war, and it's been a huge strategic mistake for this country."<ref>"Clark Under Sharp Attack in Democratic Debate," ''Washington Post'', October 10, 2003.</ref> Another media-incident started when Clark was asked if he believed [[faster-than-light]] travel was possible and he responded that he "still believe[d] in [[E%3Dmc2|E=mc<sup>2</sup>]]" but believed that at some point in human history mankind would overcome that barrier. This led to a series of headlines deriding the response, such as "Beam Us Up, General Clark" in the ''New York Times'', "Clark is Light-Years Ahead of the Competition" in the ''Washington Post'', "General Relativity (Retired)" on the [[U.S. News and World Report]] website, and "Clark Campaigns at Light Speed" in [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired'']] magazine.<ref>Felix, pgs. 174-175.</ref><ref>[http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,60629,00.html Clark Campaigns at Light Speed] by Brian McWilliams on September 30, 2003.

Several polls from September to November of 2003 showed Clark leading the Democratic field of candidates or as a close second to [[Howard Dean]]. Since Dean consistently polled in the lead in the [[Iowa caucus|Iowa caucuses]], Clark opted out of participating in the caucus entirely to focus on later primaries instead. The [[Iowa Democratic Party caucuses, 2004|2004 Iowa caucus]] was a turning point in the campaign for the Democratic nomination, however, as front-runners Dean and [[Dick Gephardt]] garnered results far lower than expected and [[John Kerry]] and [[John Edwards]] campaigns' benefiting in Clark's absence. Though Clark performed reasonably well in later primaries, such as a tie for third place with Edwards in the [[New Hampshire primary]] and narrowly winning the [[Oklahoma]] primary over Edwards, he saw his third-place finish in [[Tennessee]] and distant third in [[Virginia]] as signs that he had lost [[Southern United States|the South]] which his campaign had been centered on. He withdrew from the race on [[February 11]], [[2004]] and announced his endorsement of [[John Kerry]] at a rally in [[Madison, Wisconsin]] on [[February 13]].<ref>[http://clark04.com/speeches/044/ Wes Clark Endorses John Kerry] by Wesley Clark on [[February 13]] [[2004]].
