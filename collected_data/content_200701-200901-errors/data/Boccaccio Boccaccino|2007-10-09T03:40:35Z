'''Boccaccio Boccaccino''' (c. [[1467]] &ndash; c. [[1525]]) was a painter of the early [[Italian Renaissance]], belonging to the Emilian school.  He is profiled in  [[Vasari]]'s ''[[Le Vite delle pi√π eccellenti pittori, scultori, ed architettori]]'' (or, in English, ''Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects'').

He was born in [[Ferrara]] and studied there, probably under [[Domenico Panetti]].  Few facts of his life are known.  His principal artistic activity was in [[Venice]], Ferrara, and especially in [[Cremona]], where he founded a school in which [[Benvenuto Tisio|Garofalo]] was a pupil.   

His most celebrated achievement is the frescoes in the [[Cathedral of Cremona]] (1506-1519) representing the ''Birth of the Virgin'' and some subjects from her life. His position there was taken over by [[Altobello Melone]]. His remaining works, which  include the ''Marriage of Saint Catherine'' ([[Accademia]]), the ''Virgin and Child with Four Saints'' (Venice, San Giuliano), the ''Virgin and Two Saints'' (Cremona, San Quirilo), and the ''Holy Family'' (Paris, Louvre), are considered by [[Luigi Lanzi|Lanzi]] remarkable for richness of drapery, variety of color, spirit and grace of attitude, and harmony of landscape.  Several works formerly attributed to [[Pietro Perugino]], [[Pinturicchio]], and Garofalo are now ascribed to Boccaccino.  

His son and pupil [[Camillo Boccaccino]] (1501-46) was a painter at [[Cremona]].
