:''This is an article about the novel. For a film based on it, see [[In Desert and Wilderness (film)]].''
'''''In Desert and Wilderness''''' ({{lang-pl|W pustyni i w puszczy}}) is a popular novel for young people by [[Poland|Polish]] author [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]], written in [[1912]] (it is in fact the author's only novel written for children). It is the story of two kids, Staś Tarkowski and Nel Rawlinson, kidnapped by the rebels during [[Muhammad Ahmad|Mahdi's]] rebellion in [[Sudan]]. It was filmed twice, in [[1973]] and in [[2001]].

==Publication history==
In [[1961]], [[Marian Brandys]] published ''Śladami Stasia i Nel'' (''Following the path of Staś and Nel'')
and, in [[1962]] a related ''Z Panem Biegankiem w Abisynii'' (''In [[Abyssinia]] with Mister Bieganek'').

Władysław Ślesicki, the director of the 1973 movie released a book, ''Z Tomkiem i Moniką w pustyni i w puszczy'' (''In Desert and Wilderness with Tomek and Monika'').

In [[1993]], [[Wojciech Sambory]] (a [[pen name]] for a writing team) wrote ''Powrót do Afryki'' (''A Return to Africa''), as a [[sequel]] to the novel (published by Reporter-Oficyna Wydawnicza, ISBN 83-85189-54-8).

Comic-strip ''Nowe przygody Stasia i Nel'' (''The New Adventures of Staś and Nel'') from [http://kali.xt.pl/ Piechur] weekly magazine is another [[sequel]] to Sienkiewicz's novel. It was published online on [http://steampunk.republika.pl/ Retrostacja] in [[2005]].

==Plot and characters==
Staś and Nel live in [[Port Said]], were their parents are engineers working on the [[Suez Canal]]. In the meantime, anti-British rebellion begins in [[Sudan]] under [[Muhammad Ahmad]]. Staś and Nel are captured as hostages, but eventually they escape from the captivity. Helped by some African natives they are eventually rescued by a British expedition and return to their family.

Although the novel is fictional (apart from the historical events), it was inspired by real events. A Polish boy was indeed kidnapped at those times, but has never been found. An inspiration for Nel's character was the daughter of Sienkiewicz's friend.

Heroes:
* [[Nel Rawlison]] - 8-year old British girl
* [[Stanisław Tarkowski]]-14-year old Polish boy
* Kali - African boy and friend of the two

Interestingly, Kali, although not a main character per se, is likely even more famous than the main heroes, as a popular saying in Poland was coined around the so-called ''Kali's morality'': ''If somebody takes Kali's cow, it's a bad deed. If Kali takes somebody's cow, it's a good deed.''

==Film Adaptation==
{{main|In Desert and Wilderness (film)}}
The first movie version was directed by [[Wladyslaw Slesicki|Władysław Ślesicki]] in 1973. It lasts about 3 hours, and is composed of 2 parts which were shown separately in theaters. It was released in 1973, but work on it started in 1971. The movie was filmed in [[Egypt]], [[Sudan]] and [[Bulgaria]], with an international cast and crew.

The 2001 version was directed by [[Gavin Hood]] and wrapped up in only about three months. It was filmed in [[South Africa]], [[Tunisia]] and [[Namibia]]. The original director fell ill at the very beginning of filming and his role was taken by Hood.

A mini-series were made at the same time this time as well.
