The first Royal Rumble took place on [[January 24]], [[1988]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario]]. [[Jim Duggan]]    won, and the first pay-per-view Rumble occurred a year later. [[Pat Patterson]] has been credited with "inventing" the match. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/subscriptions/webcast/royalrumble/royalrumble05/|title=WWE Webcast on Demand: Royal Rumble 2005|accessdate=January 18|accessyear=2007}}</ref>
		 
===Rules=== 	 
The Royal Rumble is comprised of 30 men; beginning with two men in the ring, and at regular timed intervals (usually, but not always, every 90 seconds), one of the remaining 28 wrestlers enters the ring. Participants must eliminate all other opponents and the winner of the event is the last wrestler remaining after all others have been eliminated.  Referees are situated at each side of the ring to validate eliminations. 	 
		 
A wrestler is eliminated when leaving the ring over the top rope, and then having both feet touch the floor (although this latter specification was not specified until the [[Royal Rumble (1995)|1995 Royal Rumble]], where the "both feet" stipulation played a crucial role in the final moments of the match). Going out between the second and third rope or under the bottom rope is not a valid elimination.  A referee must witness an elimination in order for it to be valid (in [[Royal Rumble (2000)|2000]], [[Sean Waltman|X-Pac]] was eliminated by [[The Rock (entertainer)|The Rock]] but since it was not seen by any of the referees, X-Pac re-entered the ring and continued the match until he was officially eliminated by [[Paul Wight|The Big Show]]).

An elimination can also occur when a wrestler is thrown off the top rope by a non-competing opponent, or by one who had already been eliminated, or when the participant deliberately jumps over the top rope, outside the ring.  In other words, if a wrestler goes over the top rope, regardless how it happened, that wrestler is out.  Other wrestlers can be de facto eliminated due to [[run-in|interference]] preventing the wrestler from entering the ring (examples being [[Matt Hyson|Spike Dudley]] in [[Royal Rumble (2004)|2004]] and [[Scott Garland|Scotty 2 Hotty]] in [[Royal Rumble (2005)|2005]]).

===Rewards for winning===
Since the [[Royal Rumble (1993)|1993]] event, the winner has officially been given the chance to challenge the [[WWE Championship|WWE Champion]] at [[WrestleMania]]. The stipulation stemmed from [[Royal Rumble (1992)|1992]], when the Royal Rumble decided who would win the then-vacant WWF Championship ([[Ric Flair]] won the match).

With the introduction of the [[WWE Brand Extension|brand extension]] and separate brand championships in 2002, the possibility of a [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] shot instead of the WWE Championship was added to the reward in 2003's match. Due to the revival of the [[ECW World Championship]] as a brand championship in mid-2006, the 2007 event added this championship to the winning stipulation.

This championship match is often the last event on the WrestleMania card according to principles in the WWE that states that "the Royal Rumble winner gets a first-class ticket to WrestleMania", which means that the Royal Rumble winner gets to be in the 'first class' top spot in the main event at WrestleMania. In some cases, this can be part of a stipulation for a match between the Rumble and WrestleMania, where the winner may lose his WrestleMania spot by losing another match.

===Brand extension===
With the [[WWE Brand Extension|brand extension]] introduced in mid-[[2002]], the 30 entrants from 2003 to 2006 consisted of 15 wrestlers from the [[WWE Raw|RAW]] brand and 15 from the [[WWE Friday Night SmackDown!|SmackDown!]] brand. This makes it  therefore, one of the few pay-per-view events (and certain combined non-televised shows held around WrestleMania time) with inter-brand competition on a regular basis. The official declaration for the first post-brand extension event in 2003, was that the Rumble winner faced their brand's champion at WrestleMania, but starting in [[2004]], due to a supposed "loophole" in the Rumble's stipulations, the Rumble winner has the option of challenging either brand's champion ([[Chris Benoit]] switched brands in 2004 and won the World Heavyweight Championship, which was the basis for a storyline the following year when [[Dave Bautista|Batista]] won the Rumble, but ultimately remained on RAW).

The 2007 Royal Rumble marked the first year participants from the 2006-established [[Extreme Championship Wrestling (WWE)|ECW]] brand competed along with the RAW and SmackDown! brands. Unlike previous years where each brand got an even split of wrestlers, the 2007 Rumble featured 13 wrestlers from RAW, 10 from SmackDown! and 7 from ECW. The winner of the Royal Rumble now also has the option to challenge for the [[ECW World Championship]].

==Records and statistics==
* [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] has won the most Royal Rumble matches by winning the 1997, 1998 and 2001 Rumbles.
* [[Oscar Gutierrez|Rey Mysterio]] has spent the longest time in a Royal Rumble when in 2006 he lasted a time of 1:02:12. Conversely, [[Terry Szopinski|The Warlord]] has spent the shortest time in a Royal Rumble when in 1989 he lasted a time of 0:02. 
* The longest Royal Rumble match was held in 2002 with a time of 1:09:23. The shortest Royal Rumble match was held in 1988 with a time of 33:00. It should be noted that that match only had 20 entrants. The shortest Royal Rumble with 30 entrants was the 1995 Royal Rumble at 38:39, where entrants entered at 60 second intervals.
* [[Glen Jacobs|Kane]] currently has the most consecutive appearances in the Rumble with 9 appearances from 1999 to 2007. 
* [[Glen Jacobs]] (who participated as Issac Yankem DDS, "Diesel" and Kane) has made more Royal Rumble appearances than anyone else with 11.
* In 1998, [[Mick Foley]] made the most appearances in a single Rumble, when he entered as Cactus Jack, Mankind and Dude Love.
* Stone Cold Steve Austin has made more eliminations overall than anyone else with 36.
* Kane has the record for most eliminations in a single Rumble when he eliminated 11 wrestlers in 2001.
* [[Viscera (wrestler)|Viscera]] holds the record for most opponents necessary to eliminate him, with eight other wrestlers directly involved with lifting him over the top rope in the 2007 Royal Rumble.  He also holds the record for second most as Mabel, who was eliminated by seven wrestlers in the 1994 Royal Rumble.  [[John Tenta|Earthquake]] (1990), [[Solofa Fatu|Rikishi]] (2000), and [[Mark Copani|Muhammad Hassan]] (2005) share the third most, each having been eliminated by six men.
* Three wrestlers have won two Royal Rumble matches in a row. They are Hulk Hogan (1990 & 1991), Shawn Michaels (1995 & 1996), Steve Austin (1997 & 1998).
* [[Shawn Michaels]] and [[Chris Benoit]] have both won the Royal Rumble at #1, and [[Oscar Gutierrez|Rey Mysterio]] and [[Vince McMahon]] has won it at #2, the slots theoretically least likely to allow someone to win the Rumble (it has to be reminded that the first two slots enter into the match at the same time).
* Despite being the best possible number to draw, the wrestler who entered at #30 has only been victorious once when [[The Undertaker]] won in 2007.
* The #27 slot has given more wins than any other slot. [[Big John Studd]], [[Rodney Anoai|Yokozuna]], [[Bret Hart]] and Stone Cold Steve Austin each won a Royal Rumble at 27.
* Rey Mysterio is the shortest winner of the Royal Rumble, and is also the only masked wrestler to win.
* [[Joanie Laurer|Chyna]] is the only woman who has ever participated in the Royal Rumble.
* [[Brock Lesnar]] spent the shortest time in a Rumble to win when in 2003, he spent just under 9 minutes in the match.
* The record for most consecutive eliminations is seven, set by [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]] in the 1994 Royal Rumble and later tied by [[Solofa Fatu|Rikishi]] in 2000 and [[Dalip Singh|The Great Khali]] in 2007.
*[[Shawn Michaels]] currently has the longest combined time in the Royal Rumble match with a total time of 2:49:03, close runners up include [[Chris Benoit]] with 2:37:19, [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] with 2:34:12, and [[Triple H]] with 2:32:25.

==Video box set==
WWE announced that they will release a complete [[DVD]] box set of every ''Royal Rumble'' event in its entirety (in similar fashion to the ''[[WrestleMania#Video box sets|WrestleMania]]'' Anthology releases in [[2005]]).  Note that the 1988-1999 events have never been released on DVD in North America (All except the 1999 event were released as Tagged Classics in UK). ''Royal Rumble: The Complete Anthology'' will be released on [[March 13]], [[2007]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shop/dvd/royalrumbledvd|title=Royal Rumble: The Complete Anthology Box Set |accessdate=January 18|accessyear=2007}}</ref>

==Footnotes==
<div class="references-small">
# {{note|1988_finish}} The first Royal Rumble featured only 20 men; the stipulation was changed to 30 the following year.
# {{note|1994_finish}} Both Bret Hart and Lex Luger were declared winners when it was decided that they both touched the floor at exactly the same time.
# {{note|1997_finish}} Steve Austin was eliminated, but no referee saw the elimination and made the call, so he slipped back in and eliminated everyone to become the Royal Rumble winner.
# {{note|2000_finish}} [[Paul Wight|Big Show]], who was the last man eliminated, claimed he won the 2000 Royal Rumble, as both of [[The Rock (entertainer)|the Rock's]] feet hit the floor first. He later showed video footage proving his statement right, and was awarded a match with The Rock with the WrestleMania title shot on the line (Big Show won the match, but the Rock was also granted a title shot after winning a later stipulation match) the Rock is still, however, listed as the official winner of the 2000 Royal Rumble.
# {{note|2005_finish}} Batista and [[John Cena]] were eliminated at the same time, similar to the 1994 event. Instead of co-winners, WWE chairman [[Vince McMahon]] rushed to the ring and restarted the Royal Rumble with Batista and Cena as the only participants, with Batista eventually being the victor.
