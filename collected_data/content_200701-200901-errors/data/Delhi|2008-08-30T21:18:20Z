'''Delhi''' ({{lang-hi|दिल्ली}}; {{lang-pa|ਦਿੱਲੀ}}; {{lang-ur| دلی}}; {{IPA2|d̪ɪlːiː}}; sometimes referred to as ''Dilli'') is the [[List of most populous cities in India|second largest]] metropolis of [[India]], with a population of 17 million <ref>[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/Projected_Population/Projected_population.aspx#2008 Census of India - Projected Population<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>, and  a federally-administered [[States and territories of India|union territory]] officially known as the National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCT). Located on the banks of the [[Yamuna River]] in [[northern India]], it is one of the [[List of oldest continuously inhabited cities|oldest continually inhabited cities in the world]]. 

Delhi has been the capital of several [[History of India| Indian empires]] in medieval period and a major city along the old [[trade route]]s between northwest India and the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]]s. It is the site of many ancient and medieval monuments, archaeological sites and remains. The [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Shahjahan]] built the city, now known as "Old Delhi", to serve as the capital of the [[Mughal Empire]] from 1649 to 1857.

After the [[British East India Company]] gained control of much of India during the 18th and 19th centuries, Calcutta became the capital both under [[Company rule in India|Company rule]] and under the [[British Raj]],  until [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] announced in 1911 that the capital was to move back to Delhi, and a new city, [[New Delhi]], was to be built. When India gained [[History of the Republic of India|independence from British rule]] in 1947, New Delhi was declared its capital and [[seat of government]]. As such, New Delhi houses important offices of the federal government, including the [[Parliament of India]]. 

Owing to the immigration of people from across the country, Delhi has grown to be a [[Multiculturalism|cosmopolitan]] city. Its rapid development and [[Urbanization|urbanisation]], coupled with the relatively high average income of its population, has transformed the city.<ref name="dayal">{{cite journal |last=Dayal |first=Ravi |year=2002 |month=July |title=A Kayastha’s View |journal=Seminar (web edition) |issue=515 |url=http://www.india-seminar.com/2002/515/515%20ravi%20dayal.htm |accessdate=2007-01-29}}</ref> Today, Delhi is a major cultural, political, and commercial center of India.

==Etymology==
The etymology of '''"Delhi"''' is uncertain.  The most common view is that it is an [[eponym]] of ''Dhillu'', a [[king]] who ruled the area in ancient times.<ref name=ecosurv1>{{cite web

As of July 2007, the National Capital Territory of Delhi comprises nine districts, 27&nbsp;[[tehsil]]s, 59&nbsp;census towns, 165&nbsp;villages and three statutory towns{{ndash}} the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD); the New Delhi Municipal Committee (NDMC); and the Delhi Cantonment Board (DCB).<ref name="ecosurv0102chap3">{{cite web |url=http://delhiplanning.nic.in/Economic%20Survey/Ecosur2001-02/PDF/chap3(table).PDF |title=Table 3.1: Delhi Last 10 Years (1991–2001) — Administrative Set Up |accessdate=2007-07-03 |format=PDF |work=Economic Survey of Delhi, 2001–2002 |publisher=Planning Department, Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi |pages=p177}}</ref> 

The Delhi metropolitan area lies within the National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCT). The NCT has three local municipal corporations: [[Municipal Corporation of Delhi]] (MCD), [[New Delhi Municipal Council]] (NDMC) and [[Delhi Cantonment|Delhi Cantonment Board]]. MCD is one of the largest municipal corporations in the world providing civic amenities to an estimated 13.78&nbsp;million people.<ref name="MCD"> {{cite web |url=http://www.mcdonline.gov.in/|title=About Us|publisher=Municipal Corporation of Delhi|accessdate=2006-05-13}}</ref> The capital of India, New Delhi, falls under the administration of NDMC. The chairperson of the NDMC is appointed by the Government of India in consultation with the [[Chief Minister of Delhi]].

Delhi has four major satellite cities which lie outside the National Capital Territory of Delhi. These are [[Gurgaon]] and [[Faridabad]] (in Haryana), and [[New Okhla Industrial Development Authority|NOIDA]] and [[Ghaziabad]] (in Uttar Pradesh). Delhi is divided into nine districts. Each district (division) is headed by a Deputy Commissioner and has three subdivisions. A Subdivision Magistrate heads each subdivision. All Deputy Commissioners report to the Divisional Commissioner. The District Administration of Delhi is the enforcing department for all kinds of State and Central Government policies and exercises supervisory powers over numerous other functionaries of the Government.

The [[Delhi High Court]] has jurisdiction over Delhi. Delhi also has [[lower court]]s; the [[Small Causes Court]] for civil cases, and the [[Sessions Court]] for criminal cases. The [[Delhi Police]], headed by the [[Police Commissioner of Delhi|Police Commissioner]], is one of the largest metropolitan police forces in the world.<ref name=largepolice>{{cite web

==Government and politics==

[[Image:NorthBlock.jpg|thumb|right|The [[North Block]], in [[New Delhi]], houses key government offices]]
As a special [[union territory]], in the same manner as that of Pondicherry, the National Capital Territory of Delhi has its own Legislative Assembly, Lieutenant Governor, Council of Ministers and Chief Minister. The legislative assembly seats are filled by direct election from territorial constituencies in the NCT. However, the Union Government of India and the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi jointly administer New Delhi. While services like transport and others are taken care of by the Delhi Govt., services such as the police are directly under the control of the Central Government. The legislative assembly was re-established in 1993 for the first time since 1956, with direct federal rule in the span. In addition, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) handles civic administration for the city as part of the Panchayati Raj act. New Delhi, an urban area in Delhi, is the seat of both the State Government of Delhi and the Government of India. The [[Parliament of India]], the [[Rashtrapati Bhavan]] (Presidential Palace) and the [[Supreme Court of India]] are located in New Delhi. There are 70 assembly constituencies and seven [[Lok Sabha]] (Indian parliament's lower house) constituencies in Delhi.<ref name=assmbconst>{{cite web

Delhi was a traditional stronghold of the [[Indian National Congress]], also known as the Congress Party. In the 1990s the [[BJP|Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) under the leadership of [[Madan Lal Khurana]] came into power. However in 1998, Congress regained power. [[Sheila Dixit]] of Congress is the incumbent Chief Minister. The Congress retained power in the Legislative Assembly in the 2003 election as well by a large margin. However, in 2007, the BJP scored a crushing victory over the ruling Congress in the MCD election. Both parties have advocated full-fledged statehood for Delhi, but the process to establish this has been slow.

The water supply in Delhi is managed by the [[Delhi Jal Board]] (DJB).

The DVB itself cannot generate adequate power to meet the city's demand and borrows power from India's Northern Region Grid. As a result, Delhi faces a power shortage resulting in frequent [[power outage|blackouts and brownouts]], especially during the summer season when energy demand is at its peak. Several industrial units in Delhi rely on their own electrical generators to meet their electric demand and for back up during Delhi's frequent and disruptive power cuts. A few years ago, the power sector in Delhi was handed over to private companies. The distribution of electricity is carried out by companies run by [[Tata Power]] and [[Reliance Energy]]. The [[Delhi Fire Service]] runs 43 fire stations that attend about 15,000 fire and rescue calls per year.<ref name=dfs>{{cite web

A [[Bus rapid transit|busway]] network, at present consisting of a single line between [[Ambedkar Nagar]] and [[Delhi Gate]], is also under construction.

[[Image:Autorickshaw on Raj Path New Delhi.JPG|thumb|[[Auto Rickshaw]]s are a popular means of transportation in New Delhi]]
[[Auto rickshaws]] are an important and popular means of public transportation in Delhi, as they charge a lower fare than taxis. Most run on [[Compressed Natural Gas]] and are yellow and green in colour. Although they are equipped with electronic meters, which are supposed to show the fare, these are rarely used and bargaining is the norm. 

[[Taxicab|Taxi]]s are not an integral part of Delhi public transport, though they are easily available. Private operators operate most taxis, and most neighborhoods have a taxi stand from which taxis can be ordered or picked up. In addition, [[radio taxis]], which can be ordered by calling a central number, have become increasingly popular. These are usually air-conditioned and charge a flat rate of Rs. 15 per [[kilometer]]. 

[[Indira Gandhi International Airport]] (IGI) is situated in the southwestern corner of Delhi and serves for domestic and international connections.

Delhi's high population growth rate, coupled with high economic growth rate has resulted in an ever increasing demand for transport creating excessive pressure on the city's existent transport infrastructure. As of 2008, Delhi had 55 lakhs (5.5 million) vehicles within its municipal limits, making most vehicle populous city of the world. Also, the number of vehicles in the metropolitan region, i.e., Delhi NCR ([[National Capital Region (India)]]) is 112 lakhs (11.2 million)<ref>[http://www.igovernment.in/site/traffic-snarl-snaps-42-cr-man-hour-from-delhi-ncr-workers/ Traffic snarl snaps 42 Cr man-hour from Delhi, NCR workers at iGovernment<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref>, again surpassing all the metropolitan regions of the world like New York, Los Angeles, Tokyo, Seoul, Mexico City and others.
