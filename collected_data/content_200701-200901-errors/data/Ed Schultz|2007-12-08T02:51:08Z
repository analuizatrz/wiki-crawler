:''This article is about commentator Ed Schultz. For his national radio show, see [[The Ed Schultz Show]]. For his radio show on [[KFGO]], see [[News and Views]]''
'''Edward Andrew Schultz''' (born [[January 27]], [[1954]]) is the host of ''[[The Ed Schultz Show]]'', a nationally syndicated [[U.S.]] [[talk radio]] show promising "straight talk from the heartland" from a "gun-totin', red meat-eatin' [[Left-wing politics|lefty]]."  

==Early life==
Schultz was born in [[Norfolk, Virginia]] and attended [[Granby High School]] in [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]]. He moved to the state of [[Minnesota]] to play [[American football|football]] on a scholarship from [[Minnesota State University Moorhead|Moorhead State University]], becoming the [[NCAA Division II]] passing leader in 1977. He played [[Canadian football|football]] for the [[Winnipeg Blue Bombers]] for a half-season, but was unable to adjust to the different rules of the Canadian league.

==Radio/TV career==
After his short football career ended, he went to work as a sportscaster in [[Fargo, North Dakota]], near Moorhead. He worked as a sportscaster for 15 years with two local stations, predominantly [[WDAY-TV]], the local [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate. Schultz anchored the nightly sports broadcasts for the station, and became well known across the state for his high-energy radio and TV play-by-play of [[North Dakota State University]] football and basketball games. 

Schultz was married to his WDAY news co-anchor and producer Maureen Zimmerman during much of his on-air time with the station. The two are now [[divorce]]d.

In 1988, Schultz was involved in what has over time become known as the "Whiskey Bottle Incident" in Fargo. During the [[North Dakota State University]] (NDSU) Bison 55-21 season-opening football victory over [[Northern Michigan University]], an empty whiskey bottle thrown from the student section of fans shattered a window near Schultz, who was broadcasting the game on [[WDAY-AM|WDAY]] radio, and struck color analyst Gary Barta in the stomach. Schultz, who was often the target of taunting from the NDSU students, blurted out several audible expletives over the air and left the broadcast booth to find the bottle thrower. He apologized later for his "colorful" language. Later that week, Schultz was asked by WDAY management to take a few days off to clear the air; while he said Schultz was not suspended, the vice president of WDAY indicated people could "draw their own conclusions" about Schultz's sudden removal from on-air broadcast duties.

Schultz, who was touted as the "Voice of the Bison" for many years at WDAY, left in 1996 and began broadcasting for [[KFGO]] in Fargo, now owned by [[James Ingstad]] (formerly [[Clear Channel Communications|Clear Channel]]). Schultz began doing play-by-play work on [[University of North Dakota]] (UND) Fighting Sioux football broadcasts in 1998. Schultz incurred the ire of fans when he began to disparage the Bison during rival Sioux broadcasts after his years of NDSU play by play. Schultz was also a finalist for the [[Minnesota Vikings]] radio play by play broadcast job in 2001, a job that eventually went to [[KFAN (AM)|KFAN]] radio host [[Paul Allen (radio)|Paul Allen]].

During a substitute hosting stint on a Minneapolis-based sports show in January 2003, Schultz called Sioux hockey coach [[Dean Blais]] a "jerk" and "[[bush league]]." Blais called for Schultz's removal from UND athletic broadcasts.

Even after Schultz left as UND play by play man in 2003 to focus on his national radio show, his legacy as a controversial sports figure in North Dakota did not diminish. In a 2004 ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' article on North Dakota, Schultz lost out to only [[Green Bay Packers]] quarterback [[Brett Favre]] as North Dakota's #1 "Enemy of the State".

Schultz's ''[[News and Views]]'' radio show was very similar to his WDAY ''Viewpoint'' program and quickly grew into a regional broadcast dominating the North Dakota airwaves, with additional listeners in [[South Dakota]], western [[Minnesota]], [[Montana]], [[Manitoba]], and [[Saskatchewan]]. Schultz's political views leaned towards the [[political right|right]] during the early years, and Schultz told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' that he "lined up with the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] because they were anti-tax, and I wanted to make a lot of money...." Schultz pondered a run as a Republican for the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] against [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]ic Rep. [[Earl Pomeroy]] in 1994, but decided against it after visiting with state Republican leaders. Since then, he claims to have become a Democrat in 2000, although he supported several Republican candidates in that year's election. Schultz considered running for the [[Democratic-NPL]] party nomination for governor against incumbent Republican [[John Hoeven]] in 2004, but decided to continue his career in radio.

== Political views ==
Schultz considers himself a "[[progressivism|progressive]] [[liberalism|liberal]]". As such, his talk show is generally considered to be a liberal-leaning program. He is pro-[[labor union|union]] and centers a large portion of his radio show on the "plight of [[working class]] Americans". He has also repeatedly stated that he is a liberal Democrat willing to change political parties upon necessity.

However, Schultz is not universally liberal in his views, and in fact holds several views on social issues which would commonly be considered [[conservatism|conservative]]. Schultz, for example, is opposed to [[abortion]] (though he does not want ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' overturned) and [[gay marriage]] (although he does not believe there should be a [[Constitutional amendment]] banning it).

===Schultz-Prager exchange===
Schultz has engaged in a minor conflict with talk-show host [[Dennis Prager]]. Prager defended [[William J. Bennett#Radio show comment on abortion|controversial comments]] made by [[William J. Bennett]] on the [[September 28]], [[2005]] broadcast of his morning radio program, which Schultz characterized as being [[racism|racist]].  Prager asserted that Schultz had quoted Bennett out of context and Schultz challenged Prager to a debate.  Prager accepted the challenge but Schultz never responded.  No debate has yet taken place and the issue appears to be dead.

===Air America Feud===

On [[February 13]], [[2007]], Schultz dedicated the first hour of his show to a heated monologue against [[Air America Radio]]. Air America host [[Sam Seder]] suggested that the XM Air America channel should only have Air America hosts on it and reportedly asked his viewers to call XM to remove Schultz in favor of Air America host [[Thom Hartmann]], who is replacing [[Al Franken]]. Schultz interpreted this as an attack from the entire network. Other hosts on Air America have made negative comments about Schultz, saying he is not liberal or progressive enough. {{Fact|date=September 2007}} They've also made light of his rural accent and location in [[Fargo, North Dakota]]. {{Fact|date=September 2007}} Schultz responded by saying Air America "sucks" and "If you listen to Air America, I don't want you to listen to the Ed Schultz show cause I'm better than them!" Schultz also stated, "They're [[bankrupt]] ... they don't know how to run radio," alluding to Air America's chronic financial [[Air America Radio#Bankruptcy filing under Chapter 11|problems]].

==Radio show==
''[[The Ed Schultz Show]]'' is broadcast from Fargo via the [[Jones Radio Network]] to over 100 radio stations ([[as of 2005|as of October 2005]]), including nine of the 10 largest radio markets [http://www.wegoted.com/aboutEd/index.asp]. It can currently be heard nationwide on [[Sirius Satellite Radio|Sirius Satellite Radio's]] "Sirius Left" channel, and [[XM Radio]]'s [[Air America Radio]] channel. The program can also be heard on [[Armed Forces Radio]].

Schultz continued to experience audience growth throughout 2005 and into 2006. According to a survey done by ''Talkers'' magazine, he ranked #5 nationally, with a weekly audience of more than 3 million listeners. This is the highest ranking of any liberal talk radio host up to this point.

During the [[United States Congressional elections, 2006|2006 Congressional elections]], Schultz provided opportunities for varying views on the candidates and politics in general.  This included guests such as [[Michael Rogers (activist)|Michael Rogers]] of BlogActive, a [[blog]] that identifies [[gay]] politicians and staffers. Rogers discussed “[[outing]]” Republican staffers and elected officials he believed were gay. <ref>- http://www.blogactive.com/2006/10/busy-day.html</ref> Rogers was invited back to Schultz's show several times during the Fall 2006 elections to discuss outing Republican staffers and legislators Rogers believed they were hypocrites because of their legislative votes affecting homosexuals. <ref>- http://www.wegoted.com/podcasting/archive.asp</ref> Rogers reported on US House member [[David Dreier]] (R-CA) and US Senator [[Larry Craig]] (R-ID), both of whom he believes are anti-gay closeted gay men.

On [[November 30]], [[2006]], Schultz announced he was moving to the "prime real estate" time slot from noon to 3&nbsp;p.m. in [[Eastern Time Zone (North America)|ET]], to directly compete with [[Rush Limbaugh]] and [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]], whose shows are also broadcast in that time slot.
