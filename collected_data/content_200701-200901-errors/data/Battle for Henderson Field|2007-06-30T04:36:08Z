The '''Battle for Henderson Field''', also known as the '''Battle of Henderson Field''', took place October 23–26, [[1942]], and was a land, sea, and air [[battle]] of the [[Pacific War|Pacific campaign]] of [[World War II]], between the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Navy]] and [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] (mainly [[United States Marine Corps|United States (U.S.) Marine]] and [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]) forces.  The battle was the third of three separate major land offensives by the Japanese during the [[Guadalcanal campaign]].

In the battle, U.S. Marine and Army forces, under the overall command of U.S. [[Major General]] [[Alexander Vandegrift]], successfully repulsed an attack by the Japanese 17th Army, under the command of Japanese [[Lieutenant General]] [[Harukichi Hyakutake]].  The U.S. forces were defending the Lunga perimeter, which guarded [[Henderson Field (Guadalcanal)|Henderson Field]] on Guadalcanal, that was captured from the Japanese by the Allies in landings on Guadalcanal on [[August 7]], [[1942]].  Hyakutake's force was sent to Guadalcanal in response to the Allied landings with the mission of recapturing the airfield and driving the Allied forces off of the island.  Hyakutake's soldiers conducted numerous assaults over three days at various locations around the Lunga perimeter but all were repulsed with heavy losses for the Japanese attackers.  At the same time, Allied aircraft operating from Henderson Field successfully defended against attacks on Guadalcanal by Japanese naval air and sea forces.

The battle was the last serious ground offensive conducted by Japanese forces on Guadalcanal.  After an attempt to deliver further reinforcements failed during the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]] in November, 1942, Japan conceded defeat in the struggle for the island and successfully evacuated its remaining forces by the first week of February, 1943.

==Background==
On [[August 7]], [[1942]] [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces (primarily U.S.) landed on Guadalcanal, [[Tulagi]], and [[Florida Islands]] in the [[Solomon Islands]].  The landings on the islands were meant to deny their use by the Japanese as [[Military base|bases]] for [[threat]]ening the [[materiel|supply]] routes between the U.S. and [[Australia]], and secure the islands as starting points for a [[Military campaign|campaign]] with the eventual goal of isolating the major Japanese base at [[Rabaul]] while also supporting the Allied [[New Guinea campaign]].  The landings initiated the six-month-long [[Guadalcanal campaign]].<ref>Hogue, ''Pearl Harbor to Guadalcanal'', p. 235-236.</ref>

Taking the Japanese by surprise, by nightfall on [[August 8]], the 11,000 Allied troops, under the command of [[Lieutenant General]] [[Alexander Vandegrift]] and mainly consisting of [[United States Marine Corps]] units, had [[Battle of Tulagi and Gavutu-Tanambogo|secured Tulagi]] and nearby small islands, as well as an airfield under construction at Lunga Point on Guadalcanal.  The airfield was later named [[Henderson Field]] by Allied forces.  The Allied aircraft that subsequently operated out of the airfield became known as the "[[Cactus Air Force]]" (CAF) after the Allied codename for Guadalcanal.  To protect the airfield, the U.S. Marines established a perimeter defense around Lunga Point.<ref>Morison, ''Struggle for Guadalcanal'', pp. 14–15 and Shaw, ''First Offensive'', p. 18.</ref>

In response to the Allied landings on Guadalcanal, the Japanese [[Imperial General Headquarters]] assigned the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]'s 17th Army, a [[corps]]-sized command based at [[Rabaul]] and under the command of Lieutenant-General [[Harukichi Hyakutake]], with the task of retaking Guadalcanal from Allied forces.  Beginning [[August 19]], [[1942]] various units of the 17th Army began to arrive on Guadalcanal with the goal of driving Allied forces from the island.<ref>Griffith, ''Battle for Guadalcanal'', p. 96-99, Dull, ''Imperial Japanese Navy'', p. 225.</ref>

Due to the threat by CAF aircraft based at Henderson Field, the Japanese were unable to use large, slow transport ships to deliver their troops and supplies to the island.  Instead, the Japanese used warships based at Rabaul and the [[Shortland Islands]] to carry their forces to Guadalcanal.  The Japanese warships, mainly light [[cruiser]]s or [[destroyer]]s from the 8th Fleet under the command of [[Vice Admiral]] [[Gunichi Mikawa]], were usually able to make the round trip down "[[The Slot]]" to Guadalcanal and back in a single night, thereby minimizing their exposure to CAF air attack.  Delivering the troops in this manner, however, prevented most of the soldiers' heavy equipment and supplies, such as heavy artillery, vehicles, and much food and ammunition, from being carried to Guadalcanal with them. These high speed warship runs to Guadalcanal occurred throughout the campaign and were later called the "[[Tokyo Express]]" by Allied forces and "Rat Transportation" by the Japanese.<ref>Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 202, 210-211.</ref>

[[Image:RabaulStratArea.jpg|350px|thumb|left|The Solomon Islands area.  Guadalcanal (lower right) lies at the southeastern end of "[[The Slot]]".  Rabaul is on [[New Britain]] island at the upper left of the map.]]The first attempt by the Japanese to recapture Henderson Field with 917 soldiers was defeated on [[August 21]], [[1942]] in the [[Battle of the Tenaru]].  The next attempt, from [[September 12]] through [[September 14]], with 6,000 soldiers under the command of [[Major General]] [[Kiyotake Kawaguchi]] was defeated in the [[Battle of Edson's Ridge]].  After their defeat at Edson's Ridge, Kawaguchi and the surviving Japanese troops regrouped west of the Matanikau River on Guadalcanal.<ref>Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 141–143, 156-158, 228-246, & 681.</ref>

Hyakutake immediately began to prepare for another attempt to recapture Henderson Field.  The Japanese Navy promised to support Hyakutake's next offensive by not only delivering the necessary troops, equipment, and supplies to the island, but by stepping-up air attacks on Henderson Field and sending warships to bombard the airfield.<ref>Rottman, ''Japanese Army'', p. 61, Griffith, ''Battle for Guadalcanal'', p. 152, Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 224, 251-254, 266-268, & 289-290, Dull, ''Imperial Japanese Navy'', p. 225-226, and Smith, ''Bloody Ridge'', p. 132 & 158.</ref>

As the Japanese regrouped, the U.S. forces concentrated on shoring up and strengthening their Lunga defenses.  On [[September 18]], an Allied naval convoy delivered 4,157 men from the 3rd Provisional Marine Brigade ([[U.S. 7th Marine Regiment]]) to Guadalcanal.  These reinforcements allowed Vandegrift, beginning on [[September 19]], to establish an unbroken line of defense completely around the Lunga perimeter.<ref>Griffith, ''Battle for Guadalcanal'', p. 156 and Smith, ''Bloody Ridge'', p. 198-200.</ref>

General Vandegrift and his staff were aware that Kawaguchi's troops had retreated to the area west of the Matanikau and that numerous groups of Japanese stragglers were scattered throughout the area between the Lunga Perimeter and the Matanikau River.  Vandegrift, therefore, decided to conduct a [[Actions along the Matanikau|series]] of small unit operations around the Matanikau Valley.<ref>Smith, ''Bloody Ridge'', p. 204 and Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 270.</ref>

[[Image:VandegriftDesk.jpg|300px|thumb|right|U.S. General Vandegrift in his command tent on Guadalcanal.]]The first U.S. Marine operation against Japanese forces west of the Matanikau, conducted between [[September 23]] and [[September 27]], [[1942]] by elements of three [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] [[battalion]]s, was repulsed by Kawaguchi's troops under Colonel [[Akinosuka Oka]]'s local command.  In the second action between [[October 6]] and [[October 9|9]], a larger force of U.S. Marines successfully crossed the Matanikau River, attacked newly landed Japanese forces from the 2nd Infantry Division under the command of generals [[Masao Maruyama (Lieutenant General)|Masao Maruyama]] and [[Yumio Nasu]], and almost completely destroyed the Japanese 4th Infantry Regiment.  The second action forced the Japanese to retreat from their positions east of the Matanikau.<ref>Smith, ''Bloody Ridge'', p. 204-215, Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 269-290, Zimmerman, ''The Guadalcanal Campaign'', p. 96-101, Griffith, ''Battle for Guadalcanal'', p. 169-176, and Hough, ''Pearl Harbor to Guadalcanal'', p. 318-322.</ref>

In the meantime, [[Major General]] Millard F. Harmon, commander of [[United States Army]] forces in the the South Pacific, convinced [[Vice Admiral]] [[Robert L. Ghormley]], commander of Allied forces in the [[Pacific Ocean Areas (command)|South Pacific Area]], that U.S. Marine forces on Guadalcanal needed to be reinforced immediately if the Allies were to successfully defend the island from the next, expected Japanese offensive.  Thus, on [[October 13]], a ship convoy delivered the 2,837 men of the [[164th Infantry Regiment (United States)|164th Infantry Regiment]] from the U.S. Army's [[Americal Division]] to Guadalcanal.<ref>Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 293-297, Cook, ''Cape Esperance'', p. 16, 19-20, Morison, ''Struggle for Guadalcanal'', p. 147-149, and Dull, ''Imperial Japanese Navy'', p. 225.</ref>

Mikawa's ships continued nocturnal deliveries of men and materiel to Guadalcanal.  Between [[October 1]] and [[October 17]] Japanese naval convoys delivered 15,000 Japanese troops, plus artillery, tanks, ammunition, and provisions to Guadalcanal.  One of these convoys on [[October 9]] landed General Hyakutake on the island to personally lead the Japanese forces in the planned offensive.  Mikawa also sent heavy cruisers on several occasions to bombard Henderson Field.  One of these bombardment missions on the night of [[October 11]] was intercepted by U.S. naval forces and defeated in the [[Battle of Cape Esperance]].<ref>Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 289-330, Morison, ''Struggle for Guadalcanal'', p. 149-171, Hough, ''Pearl Harbor to Guadalcanal'', p. 322,   and Dull, ''Imperial Japanese Navy'', p. 226-230.</ref>

[[Image:Lieutenant General Harukichi Hyakutake in front of HQ Rabaul.jpg|225px|thumb|left|Japanese General Harukichi Hyakutake in front of his headquarters on Rabaul before his deployment to Guadalcanal.]]On [[October 13]], in order to help protect the transit of an important supply convoy to Guadalcanal that consisted of six slower cargo ships, the Japanese Combined Fleet commander [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] sent a naval force from [[Chuuk|Truk]] to bombard Henderson Field.  The force, consisting of the battleships [[Japanese battleship Kongō|''Kongō'']] and [[Japanese battleship Haruna|''Haruna'']], escorted by one light cruiser and nine destroyers, approached Guadalcanal unopposed and opened fire on Henderson Field at 01:33 on [[October 14]].  Over the next one hour and 23 minutes, the two battleships fired 973 14-inch shells into the Lunga perimeter, most of them falling in and around the 2,200-meter-square area of the airfield.  The bombardment heavily damaged the field's two runways, burned almost all of the available aviation fuel, destroyed 48 of the CAF's 90 aircraft, and killed 41 men, including six CAF pilots.<ref>Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 315-320, Morison, ''Struggle for Guadalcanal'', p. 171-175.</ref>

In spite of the heavy damage, Henderson personnel were able to restore one of the runways to operational condition within a few hours.  Over the next several weeks, the CAF gradually recovered as Allied forces delivered more aircraft, fuel, and aircrew personnel to Guadalcanal.  Observing the Japanese deliveries of troops and supplies to the island, American forces were expecting an imminent offensive by Japanese ground forces, but weren't sure where and when it would take place.<ref>Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 319-321.</ref>

Because of the loss of their positions on the east side of the Matanikau, the Japanese decided that an attack on the U.S. defenses along the coast would be prohibitively difficult.  Thus, after observation of the American defences around Lunga Point by his staff officers, Hyakutake decided that the main thrust of his planned attack would be from south of Henderson Field.  His 2nd Division, under Lieutenant General [[Masao Maruyama]] comprising three infantry regiments with nine battalions was ordered to march through the jungle and attack the American defences from the south near the east bank of the Lunga River.  The 2nd Division was split into three units; the Left Wing Unit under Major General [[Yumio Nasu]] containing the 29th Infantry Regiment, the Right Wing Unit under Major General [[Kiyotake Kawaguchi]] consisting of the 230th Infantry Regiment, and the division reserve led by Maruyama comprising the 16th Infantry Regiment.  The date of the attack was set for [[October 22]].  To distract the Americans from the planned attack from the south, Hyakutake's heavy artillery plus five battalions of infantry under Major General [[Tadashi Sumiyoshi]] were to attack the American defenses from the west along the coastal corridor.  The Japanese estimated that there were 10,000 American troops on the island, when in fact there were about 23,000.<ref>Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 328-340.</ref>

The Lunga River runs through the center of the map.  The Matanikau River is off the map to the left.]]At this time, the Lunga perimeter was defended by four American regiments.  The 164th Infantry Regiment, a [[United States Army]] unit, guarded the easternmost sector.  Extending from the 164th south and west across Edson's Ridge to the Lunga River was the 7th Marine Regiment.  Covering the sector west of the Lunga to the coast were the 1st and 5th Marine Regiments.  Defending the mouth of the Matanikau for the Americans were two battalions under the command of Lieutenant Colonel William J. McKelvy:  the 3d Battalion, 1st Marines, and the 3d Battalion, 7th Marines.  McKelvy's force was separated from the Lunga perimeter by a gap that was covered by patrols.<ref>Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 343-344.</ref>

==Battle==
===Prelude===
On [[October 12]], a company of Japanese engineers began to break a trail, called the "Maruyama Road", from the Matanikau through the jungle towards the southern portion of the U.S. Lunga perimeter.  Between [[October 16]] and [[October 18]], the 2nd Division began their march along the Maruyama Road, led by Nasu's unit and followed in order by Kawaguchi and Maruyama.<ref>Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 339-341.  Hyakutake sent a member of his staff, Colonel [[Masanobu Tsuji]] to monitor the 2nd Division's progress along the trail and to report to him on whether the attack could begin on [[October 22]] as scheduled  Masanobu Tsuji has been identified by some historians as the most likely cuprit behind the [[Bataan death march]].</ref>

Early on the morning of [[October 20]], Maruyama reached the Lunga River.  Believing that his units were now about four miles south of the airfield, he ordered the the left and right wing units to now advance abreast of each other parallel to the Lunga north towards the American lines and set the time of the attack for [[24-hour clock|18:00]] on [[October 22]].    Maruyama, however, was mistaken.  He and his troops were actually eight miles south of the airfield.  By the evening of [[October 21]], it was clear to Murayama that his units wouldn't be in position to attack the next day, so he postponed the attack to [[October 23]].  By the evening of [[October 22]], much of the 2nd Division still remained strung-out along the Murayama Road, but Murayama ruled-out any postponement of the attack.<ref>Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 342-345.</ref>

During this time Sumiyoshi prepared his command to attack the American forces from the west.  On [[October 18]], he began shelling Henderson Field with 15 150 mm howitzers.  What remained of the 4th Infantry Regiment under Colonel Nakaguma began to gather openly near Point Cruz (on the coast just west of the Matanikau).  On [[October 19]] Colonel Akinosuka Oka led his 124th Infantry Regiment across the Matanikau and began moving up the east bank towards high ground east of the river.<ref>Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 342-344.</ref>
