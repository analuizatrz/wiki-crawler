'''Sir Patrick Alfred Caldwell-Moore''', [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]], [[Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society|HonFRS]], [[Royal Astronomical Society|FRAS]] (born [[4 March]], [[1923]]), known as '''Patrick Moore''', is an [[England|English]] [[Amateur astronomy|amateur astronomer]] who has attained legendary status in British astronomy as a long-running writer, organizer and presenter of the subject. He is a member and former president of the [[British Astronomical Association]], co-founder and former president of the [[Society for Popular Astronomy]], author of over 70 books on astronomy, presenter of the longest running television series with the same presenter, ''[[The Sky at Night]]'' on the [[BBC]], and a well-known figure on British television (such as being the [[Gamesmaster]]). He has a reputation for [[eccentricity (behaviour)|eccentricity]], stemming mainly from his mode of speech, his trademark [[monocle]], and his fondness for the [[xylophone]].

==Biography==
Sir Patrick was born in [[Pinner]], [[Middlesex]], [[England]] and at an early age moved to [[Sussex]], where he grew up. His youth was marked by poor health, and he was educated at home. Influenced by his mother, he developed an interest in [[astronomy]] that persisted into later life and helped to make him a famous and popular personality. During the [[Second World War]], Moore served in the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] and from 1940 until 1945 was a navigator in [[RAF Bomber Command]], reaching the rank of [[Flight Lieutenant]]. The war had a significant influence on his life: his only known romance ended when his fiancée Lorna, a nurse, was killed by a bomb which fell on her ambulance. When later asked why he never married, he answered that "second best is no good for me"{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.

After the war, Sir Patrick constructed a home-made [[reflecting telescope]] in his garden and began to observe the [[Moon]]. He was fascinated by the subject and he is now acknowledged as a specialist in [[Moon|lunar]] observation, with one of his particular areas of expertise being studying the glimpses of the Moon's [[Far side (Moon)|far side]] that are occasionally visible due to the Moon's [[libration]]. He was also an early observer of [[Transient lunar phenomena]], short-lived glowing areas on the lunar surface. In 1945, he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]]. At 10:30 pm on [[April 26]], [[1957]], in an event that was to be a landmark of his career, Moore presented the first episode of ''The Sky at Night'', a monthly BBC television program for astronomy enthusiasts. Since then, he has appeared on the show every month, with the exception of  [[July 2004]] due to a near-fatal bout of [[food poisoning]], making him the world's longest-running [[television presenter]] and a well-recognised face on British television. Since 2004, the programme has been presented from Sir Patrick's home rather than at the BBC studios due to mobility problems caused by arthritis.

Sir Patrick has done some significant work in the field of astronomy: in 1959, the [[Soviet Union]] used his charts of the moon to correlate their first pictures of the far side with his mapped features on the near side and he was involved in the lunar mapping used by the [[NASA]] [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] [[Manned space mission|space missions]]. In 1965, Sir Patrick was appointed Director of the newly-constructed [[Armagh Planetarium]], a post he held until 1968. During the Apollo program, he was one of the major presenters of [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] television's coverage of the moon landing missions, the recordings of which the BBC wiped during the 1970s when it was believed that such old material had little value and the expense of storage could be saved. In 1982 [[asteroid]] [[2602 Moore]] was named in his honour. He compiled the [[Caldwell catalog|Caldwell catalogue]] of astronomical objects.

For a time during the [[1970s]], he was the Chairman of the anti-immigration [[United Country Party]]. He held this position until the party was absorbed by the [[New Britain Party]] in 1980. He is currently a prominent member of the [[United Kingdom Independence Party]]. He is also a long-standing opponent of [[fox hunting]] and all blood sports. In fact, Sir Patrick has been a life-long animal lover, actively supporting many animal welfare charities. He has a particular affinity for cats and currently has two, Jeannie and Ptolemy.

In 2001, Moore was [[knighthood|knighted]] and was appointed an [[Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society]]. He also won a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] for his services to television. In June 2002, Sir Patrick became Honorary Vice President of the Society for the History of Astronomy, the UK's national society in this field, and continues to serve in this capacity.  In January 2006 he released the DVD of his biography ''The Astronomical Patrick Moore'' for sale online.<ref>The DVD is available to order from its [http://www.movingimageco.com/ publisher's site].</ref> On [[7 March]] [[2006]], it was reported that he had been hospitalised with heart problems, followed two days later by the announcement that he had been fitted with a [[artificial pacemaker|pacemaker]].

==Other interests and popular culture==
Aside from ''The Sky at Night'', a number of other television and radio shows have seen appearances from Moore, including six years, from 1992 until 1998, playing the role of [[Gamesmaster]] in the television show of the same name: a character who professed to know everything there is to know about video gaming and sported his trademark monocle. He also appeared, in often self-parodying roles, in several episodes of ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]''. He was heard in a minor role during the fourth radio series of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''. He has written  more than 70 books, mostly [[non-fiction]] dealing with astronomical topics and several [[science fiction]] [[novel]]s. He has also written two [[operetta]]s, one of them entitled ''[[Galileo: The True Story]]''. His first novels were a series about the first arrivals on [[Mars]], followed in 1977 by the start of the ''Scott Saunders Space Adventure'' series, aimed primarily at a younger audience, which eventually ran to six novels.

Until being forced to give up due to [[arthritis]], Moore was a keen [[musician]] and accomplished [[xylophone]] player. He sometimes performed novelty turns at the [[Royal Variety Performance]] and once appeared in a song-and-dance act in a [[Morecambe and Wise]] Christmas spectacular. As a guest on [[Have I Got News For You]], he accompanied the show's closing theme tune on the xylophone and as a pianist, once accompanied [[Albert Einstein]] playing ''The Swan'' by [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] on the violin. He is a long-time friend of [[Queen (band)|Queen]] guitarist and fellow astronomer [[Brian May]], who is a regular guest on [[The Sky At Night]]. The pair have co-authored a book with [[Chris Lintott]], called ''Bang! The Complete History of the Universe''.

Part of Moore's observatory was destroyed by a tornado which struck Selsey in January 1998.<ref>The tornado was covered on the [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/45580.stm  BBC News website] </ref> The observatory was later rebuilt.

== Eccentric personality ==

Due to his long-running television and xylophone playing career, eccentric manner, distinctively rapid speech delivery and in later years his ever-present monocle, Moore is widely-recognised and well-respected in the United Kingdom, even by those with no interest in astronomy. This was used to great advantage for a 1976 [[April Fool's Day|April Fool]]'s joke on [[BBC Radio 2]], when Moore announced that at 9.47 am a once-in-a-lifetime astronomical event was going to occur: Pluto would pass behind Jupiter, temporarily causing a gravitational alignment that would reduce the Earth's own gravity. Moore informed listeners that if they could jump at the exact moment that this event occurred, they would experience a temporary floating sensation.  The BBC later received hundreds of phone calls from listeners claiming to have felt the sensation.

Moore joined the [[Flat Earth Society]] as an ironic joke though many have taken this seriously.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}
