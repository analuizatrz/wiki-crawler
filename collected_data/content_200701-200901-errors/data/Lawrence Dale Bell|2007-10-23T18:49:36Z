'''Lawrence Dale "Larry" Bell''' ([[April 5]], [[1894]] - [[October 20]], [[1956]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[industrialist]] and founder of [[Bell Aircraft Corporation]]. 

Bell was born in [[Mentone, Indiana]] and lived there until [[1907]], when his family moved to [[Santa Monica, California]]. He joined his older brother Grover and stunt pilot [[Lincoln Beachey]] as a mechanic in [[1912]]. Grover Bell was killed in a plane crash the following year, and Bell vowed to quit aviation for good; however, he went to work for the [[Glenn L. Martin Company]] after friends convinced him to return to the industry. He became Martin's shop foreman at age 20, and later the company's general manager.

He left Martin in [[1928]] to join [[Consolidated Aircraft]] in [[Buffalo, New York]], eventually becoming vice president and general manager. When Consolidated relocated to [[San Diego]], Bell stayed in Buffalo and founded his own company, Bell Aircraft Corporation, on [[July 10]], [[1935]]. Bell Aircraft built the [[P-39]] "Airacobra" and [[P-63]] "Kingcobra" [[fighter aircraft]] during [[World War II]].  Their [[P-59]] "Airacomet" was the first jet powered fighter built for the [[U.S. Army Air Force]], but it was not successful, and did not see combat.  Postwar, they produced the [[Bell X-1]], the first aircraft to break the [[sound barrier]] in level flight. The company began developing [[helicopter]]s in [[1941]], with the [[Bell 30]] taking its maiden flight in [[1943]].  This early model evolved into the [[Bell 47]], one of the most recognizable aircraft in history.

For his role in the X-1's first supersonic flight, he shared the [[1947]] [[Collier Trophy]] with pilot [[Chuck Yeager]] and [[John Stack]], a research scientist with the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (now [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]]). He was awarded the [[Society of Automotive Engineers]]' Daniel Guggenheim Medal in [[1944]], and was posthumously inducted into the [[National Aviation Hall of Fame]] ([[1977]]), the [[Army Aviation Hall of Fame]] ([[1986]]), and the [[International Aerospace Hall of Fame]] ([[2004]]).
