'''Yves Coppens''' (born [[1934]]) is a French [[anthropology|anthropologist]]. He has studied ancient [[Hominidae|hominid]]s and has had multiple published works on this topic, and a film. He is one of the co-discoverers of [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]]. The ''[[Rift Valley theory]]'', proposed and supported by the Dutch primatologist [[Adriaan Kortlandt]], became better known when it was later espoused and renamed by Coppens as the ''[[East Side Story]]''. As [[Richard Dawkins]] says in ''[[The Ancestor's Tale]]'': "In his native France, Yves Coppens is widely cited as the discoverer of [[Australopithecus afarensis|Lucy]], even as the "father" of Lucy. In the English-speaking World, this important discovery is attributed to [[Donald Johanson]]."<ref>{{citebook|title=The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution |author= Richard Dawkins|year= 2004|publisher=Mariner Books| pages=104|id=ISBN 061861916X |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZicUataX4G0C&pg=PA104&ots=Ai3eXnKM4p&dq=%22Yves+Coppens%22&as_brr=3&ie=ISO-8859-1&output=html&sig=eAtwcTGzHwZARXVkc6uvX_wXOrU}}</ref>
