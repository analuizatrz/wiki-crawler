'''Historically black colleges and universities''' ('''HBCUs''') are institutions of [[higher education in the United States]] that were established before [[1964]] with the intention of serving the [[African American]] community. They are often [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts colleges]] or [[universities]].

==Overview==
There are 114 historically black colleges in the [[United States]] today which vary between two year and four year institutions and public and private funding.  Most are located in the [[Southeastern United States]].  Four are located in the [[Midwestern United States|midwestern]] states (two each in [[Missouri]] and [[Ohio]]), two are located in [[Pennsylvania]], one is in [[Delaware]], and one is in the [[United States Virgin Islands|Virgin Islands]].<ref>{{cite news|title=

Other educational institutions have large numbers of African Americans in their student body, but were founded (or opened their doors to African Americans) after the ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' ruling by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] (the court decision which outlawed [[racial segregation]] of public education facilities).  By definition they are not '''historically''' black colleges. Such institutions have been termed '''predominantly black'''.

==HBCUs in popular culture==
HBCUs have made prominent appearances in popular culture. Perhaps the most famous example occurred during the [[1980s]] through programming by [[Bill Cosby]].  Cosby initially referenced HBCUs on his television program,  ''[[The Cosby Show]]'', when [[Fisk University]], [[Spelman College]], [[Howard University]] and [[Tuskegee University]] were all mentioned in several episodes. The series star, [[Bill Cosby]], a prominent donor to several historically black institutions, was often seen wearing college sweatshirts from several institutions (including [[Savannah State University|Savannah State College]], [[Fisk University]], [[Morgan State University]], [[Cheyney University]], [[Benedict College]], [[Spelman College]], [[Xavier University of Louisiana]] and [[Shaw University]]) in various episodes. On one episode, a friend of Denise (played by [[Blair Underwood]]) stated that he was going to attend [[Central State University]] in [[Wilberforce, Ohio]] on an academic scholarship. On the final episode of the series, Cosby wore a [[Tuskegee University]] T-shirt for the entire show.

[[Lisa Bonet]], who portrayed the character [[List_of_The_Cosby_Show_characters#Denise_Huxtable_Kendall|Denise Huxtable]], on ''The Cosby Show,'' was given her own television program, ''[[A Different World (TV series)|A Different World]]'' in 1987. This series  dealt with the life of students at the fictional historically Black college, ''Hillman College'', and ran for six seasons on [[NBC]]. Portions of the series were filmed at [[Morehouse College]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].  According to the ''Museum of Broadcast Communications'', when [[Debbie Allen]] became the director-producer of ''[[A Different World]]'', Allen (herself a graduate of historically black [[Howard University]]), "drew from her college experiences in an effort to accurately reflect in the show the social and political life on black campuses.  Moreover, Allen instituted a yearly spring trip to Atlanta where series writers visited two of the nation's leading black colleges, [[Morehouse College|Morehouse]] and [[Spelman College|Spelman]]. During these visits, ideas for several of the episodes emerged from meetings with students and faculty".<ref name=mbc>{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/D/htmlD/differentwor/differentwor.htm |title=A Different World |publisher=''The Museum of Broadcast Communications'' |accessdate=2006-06-15}}</ref>

Other examples include [[Spike Lee]]'s ''[[School Daze]]'' which was filmed on the campus of [[Morehouse College]] and depicted black college life (mainly centered around the historically black sororities and fraternities) in the Atlanta University Center; [[Black Entertainment Television|Black Entertainment Television's]] reality television series ''[[College Hill]]'' follows the lives of students at historically black colleges. Previous seasons of this show followed students at [[Southern University]], [[Langston University]], and [[Virginia State University]]. A spin-off show was created following students at [[Grambling State University]]; the 2002 film ''[[Drumline (film)|Drumline]]'', filmed at [[Clark Atlanta University]] [http://bishops.umc.org/interior.asp?ptid=1&mid=7361], tells the story of a young student from New York who enters a fictional historically Black university and attempts to lead the school's marching band drum section; and the 2007 film ''[[Stomp the Yard]]'' took place at a fictional HBCU and was filmed on the campuses of [[Clark Atlanta University]], [[Morehouse College]], and [[Morris Brown College]] in Atlanta.

In addition, [[Will Smith]] wore [[Grambling State University]], [[Southern University]], and [[Tuskegee University]] paraphernalia during several episodes of ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'', [[Britney Spears]] wore a [[Southern University]] T-shirt in her movie [[Crossroads (2002 film)|Crossroads]], and [[Dave Chappelle]] includes a marching band from [[Central State University]], located in [[Wilberforce, Ohio]] in his film "Dave Chapelle's Block Party." Dave took this entire band to NYC for a weekend block party.

==HBCUs in literature==
[[Ralph Ellison]]'s [[1952]] novel ''[[Invisible Man]]'' begins at a fictional HBCU that is modeled on [[Alabama]]'s [[Tuskegee University|Tuskegee Institute]], where Ellison himself majored in [[music]]. The novel is considered a classic of 20th century [[American literature]].
