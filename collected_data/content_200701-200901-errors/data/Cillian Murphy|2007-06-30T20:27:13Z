==Biography==
===Early life===
Murphy was born in [[Douglas, Cork]] in [[Ireland]]. ''Cillian'' is an Irish name which is [[anglicised]] ''Killian''; both spellings are [[IPA chart for English|pronounced]] "Killyann" (though the former spelling is often mispronounced "Sillian").<ref name="LA Times story">[http://www.calendarlive.com/printedition/calendar/suncal/cl-ca-cillian11mar11,0,285449.story?coll=cl-suncal Cillian Murphy: more to offer than pale blue eyes] ''The Los Angeles Times'', 11 March 2007</ref> In [[Irish Language|Irish]], his name is Cillian Ó Murchú, but he has never used that professionally.<ref name="Cillian Murphy IMDb Page">[http://imdb.com/name/nm0614165/ Cillian Murphy - Filmography] IMDb</ref> His father was a school inspector and his mother was a French teacher. The oldest of four children, Murphy has one brother named Páidi and two sisters named Sile and Orla.<ref name="Cillian Murphy IMDb Biography Page">[http://imdb.com/name/nm0614165/bio Cillian Murphy - Biography] IMDb</ref> Murphy attended the Catholic school [[Presentation Brothers College, Cork]].

Originally, Murphy was most interested in performing as a [[rock musician]]. He played guitar and sang with a [[Frank Zappa]] influenced band called The Sons of Mr. Greengenes. In 1996, the band was offered a record deal, but they didn't sign, partially because Páidi, who also played in the band, was still in secondary school and their parents didn't approve, but also because the contract was to pay very little and would have given the rights to Murphy's compositions to the record label.<ref name="From Cork to Gotham">[http://www.cilliansite.com/press/feature-stories/2004-02-08-sundayindie From Cork to Gotham] ''Sunday Independent Life'', 8 February 2004 (on The CillianSite)</ref>

That same year, Murphy started studying [[law]] at [[University College Cork]] (UCC), but flunked his first year exams; <ref name="From Cork to Gotham">[http://www.cilliansite.com/press/feature-stories/2004-02-08-sundayindie From Cork to Gotham] ''Sunday Independent Life'', 8 February 2004 (on The CillianSite)</ref> after seeing a stage production of ''[[A Clockwork Orange]]'', his interest had begun to shift to acting.<ref name="More to offer than pale blue eyes">[http://www.cilliansite.com/press/feature-stories/2007-03-08-latimes Cillian Murphy: More to offer than pale blue eyes] ''The Los Angeles Times'', 8 March 2007 (on The CillianSite)</ref> His first major role was in the UCC Drama Society production of ''[[Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme]]''.

===Career===
In September 1996, Murphy landed his first role on the professional stage, originating the role of Pig in [[Enda Walsh]]'s ''[[Disco Pigs]]'', directed by [[Pat Kiernan]].<ref name="Disco Pigs play info">[http://www.cilliansite.com/body-of-work/plays/disco-pigs Disco Pigs, original stage production] The CillianSite's Body of Work section</ref> A [[Cork (city)|Cork]] production, ''Disco Pigs'' ended up touring throughout [[Europe]] and in [[Canada]] for over two years, and Murphy left university. He later reprised his ''Disco Pigs'' role for the 2001 independent film version by [[Kirsten Sheridan]]. The closing credits feature Murphy performing his original song "So New". 

From 1997 to 2002, Murphy starred in feature films, [[Short film|shorts]], plays and in the BBC mini-series adaptation of ''[[The Way We Live Now]]'', but it was not until [[Danny Boyle]]'s ''[[28 Days Later...]]'' became a [[sleeper hit]] in the [[United States of America|USA]] in 2003, that the major movie studios and directors started to take notice. As for the actor's full-frontal nudity in the film, Murphy claimed he was perfectly comfortable doing nudity if the role called for it.

In 2003, he starred alongside [[Colin Farrell]] in the Irish [[Independent film|indie]] ''[[Intermission (film)|Intermission]]'' and had supporting roles in his first Hollywood films, ''[[Cold Mountain (film)|Cold Mountain]]'' and ''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring (film)|Girl with a Pearl Earring]]''. For the latter film, he learned to chop up meat in an abattoir for his role as a butcher, even though he is a vegetarian.<ref name="Irish Tatler">[http://www.cilliansite.com/press/feature-stories/2004-02-00-irishtat The Butcher Boy] ''Irish Tatler'', February 2004 (on The CillianSite)</ref> 2004 found him touring Ireland in the titular role in the classic Irish play, ''[[The Playboy of the Western World]]'', as well as filming three of his biggest movie roles to date.

[[Image:RedEye05.jpg|left|thumb|Cillian as Jackson Rippner in ''[[Red Eye (film)|Red Eye]]'' with [[Rachel McAdams]]]]

2005 was the year that Murphy won wider recognition for a pair of high-profile bad guy turns as Dr. Jonathan Crane/[[supervillain]] [[Scarecrow (comics)|The Scarecrow]] in ''[[Batman Begins]]'' and Jackson Rippner in the thriller ''[[Red Eye (film)|Red Eye]]''. He originally auditioned for the role of [[Batman]] (Bruce Wayne) in ''Batman Begins''. Though the part was eventually given to [[Christian Bale]], director [[Christopher Nolan]] was reportedly very impressed with Murphy's audition and persuaded him to take the role of Dr. Jonathan Crane, whose alter ego is the villain [[Scarecrow (comics)|Scarecrow]]. In [[Wes Craven]]'s critical<ref name="Red Eye reviews">[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/red_eye/ Red Eye] Rotten Tomatoes</ref> and box office smash<ref name="Red Eye biz">[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0421239/business Box office/business for
Red Eye] IMDb</ref> ''Red Eye'', Murphy played an operative in an assassination plot who terrorizes [[Rachel McAdams]] on an overnight flight. Film critic [[Manohla Dargis]] said that Murphy made "a picture-perfect villain" and that "those baby blues look cold enough to freeze water and his wolfish leer suggests its own terrors".<ref name="Dargis">[http://movies2.nytimes.com/2005/08/19/movies/19crav.html?ex=1183348800&en=850cc8980e132e6d&ei=5070 Sticking Out a Tense Flight With a Terrorist as Seatmate] ''The New York Times'', 19 August 2005</ref>

According to ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' magazine, Murphy was #3 of "The Most Valuable Players of Summer 2005", a list for entertainers who had outstanding breakthrough performances. The magazine went on to compare him with [[Robert Mitchum]]. He received a nomination for the Best Villain honor at the [[MTV Movie Awards 2006|2006 MTV Movie Awards]] for his performance in ''Batman Begins'', but lost to [[Hayden Christensen]] for ''[[Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith]]''.

In late 2005 (early 2006 in Europe), Murphy starred as Patrick/Patricia "Kitten" Braden, a transgendered Irish orphan in search of his mother, in [[Neil Jordan]]'s dark comedy ''[[Breakfast on Pluto (film)|Breakfast on Pluto]]'', based on the novel of the same title by [[Patrick McCabe]]. He was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Actor in Musical or Comedy for this movie ([[Joaquin Phoenix]] won for ''[[Walk the Line]]''), and won the [[IFTA Award]].<ref name="IFTA news">[http://entertainment.uk.msn.com/news/Article.aspx?cp-documentid=2907063 Eva and Cillian take film accolades] U.K. MSN Entertainment News, 11 February 2007</ref> Against a kaleidoscopic backdrop of 1970s [[glitter rock]] fashion, magic shows, red light districts and [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] violence, Murphy charmingly transforms from androgynous teen to high [[drag (clothing)|drag]] [[blond bombshell]]. ''[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]'''s Ruthe Stein wrote, {{cquote|Murphy projects enormous energy onscreen, as he's already shown in ''28 Days Later...'' and ''Red Eye''. He's supremely well cast as the androgynous Kitten. ...Murphy smoothly makes the transition from broad comedy to drama. He delivers Kitten's favorite line, "Oh serious, serious, serious!" with the full implications of its dual meaning.<ref name="Stein">[http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/12/23/DDGOIGBLJN1.DTL&type=movies Walking on thin gender line in search of love] ''The San Francisco Chronicle'', 23 December 2005</ref>}}

In 2006/2007, he starred in [[Ken Loach]]'s film about the [[Irish War of Independence]] and [[Irish Civil War|Civil War]], ''[[The Wind That Shakes the Barley (film)|The Wind That Shakes the Barley]]'', which won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]] and replaced ''[[Intermission (film)|Intermission]]'' as the most successful independent film in Irish history. Murphy's performance as young doctor Damien O'Donovan was highly praised. [[David Denby]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' described his approach to the part: {{cquote|Murphy is normally very quiet in movies; he has attained his mystique as an actor by staring at people with baby-blue eyes. In this film, too, he has, at times, a deep stillness, but he has idiosyncratic moments as well, such as when Damien has to execute a teen-ager who has ratted on the I.R.A. Murphy, writhing, shoots the boy and stumbles away, nausea struggling against duty.<ref name="Denby">[http://www.cilliansite.com/press/reviews/2007-03-19-newyorker-twtstb Taking Sides] ''The New Yorker'', 19 March 2007 (on The CillianSite)</ref>}}

Murphy returned to the stage from November 2006 to February 2007 to play the lead role in John Kolvenbach's play ''Love Song'', opposite [[Neve Campbell]], in London's West End. In 2007, he stars as a physicist-astronaut charged with re-igniting the sun in the [[sci-fi]] movie ''[[Sunshine (2007 film)|Sunshine]]'', which re-teams him with director [[Danny Boyle]], and as a cinephile in [[Paul Soter]]'s forth-coming romantic comedy, ''[[Watching the Detectives]]'', opposite [[Lucy Liu]].

Murphy has recently finished filming ''[[The Edge of Love]]'' with [[Keira Knightley]], [[Sienna Miller]] and [[Matthew Rhys]] in Wales and London. Murphy has also been spotted filming on the set of ''Batman Begins'' sequel ''[[The Dark Knight]]'', reprising his role as The Scarecrow, though it's not known how big his role in the upcoming film may be.<ref name="MegaStar">[http://www.megastar.co.uk/movies/news-single-view/article/28/batpods-and-scarecrows-1.html Batpods and Scarecrows] ''MegaStar'', 25 June 2007</ref>

Just cast in the newly announced ''[[Hippie Hippie Shake]]'' (again alongside Sienna Miller), Murphy will star as [[Richard Neville]], the editor of the psychedelic, radical underground magazine ''[[Oz (magazine)|Oz]]'', which was at the center of what was then the longest obscenity trial in British history. Shooting starts in the fall.<ref name="Hippie Hippie Shake announced">[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i0c726bd1e68cd8aaeb602a2cf542e38c Four tune in, turn on, drop] ''Hollywood Reporter'', 3 May 2007</ref>

===Personal life===
Murphy is known for being intensely private about his personal life. He married his long-time live-in girlfriend, artist [[Yvonne McGuinness]], in August 2004 in [[Provence]], [[France]]. The couple live in [[London]], [[England]], with their son Malachy  (b. December 4, 2005).

He is friends with fellow Irish actors [[Jonathan Rhys Meyers]], [[Colin Farrell]] and [[Liam Neeson]]. Murphy has said that he greatly admires Neeson and looks up to him like a surrogate movie dad.<ref name="Cillian Murphy IMDb Biography Page">[http://imdb.com/name/nm0614165/bio Cillian Murphy - Biography] IMDb</ref> His other idols include [[Al Pacino]], [[Johnny Depp]], [[Meryl Streep]], and [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]].<ref name="Irish Tatler">[http://www.cilliansite.com/press/feature-stories/2004-02-00-irishtat The Butcher Boy] ''Irish Tatler'', February 2004 (on The CillianSite)</ref>

Aside from English, Murphy is also fluent in [[French language|French]] and [[Irish language|Irish]].<ref name="Cillian Murphy IMDb Biography Page">[http://imdb.com/name/nm0614165/bio Cillian Murphy - Biography] IMDb</ref> 

Murphy was originally raised [[Catholic]] before becoming [[agnostic]]. He later became a full [[atheist]] after researching for his role as a physicist in ''[[Sunshine (2007 film)|Sunshine]]''.<ref name="The Daily Record: Danny's New Golden Boy">[http://www.cilliansite.com/press/feature-stories/2007-03-30-dailyrec Danny's New Golden Boy] ''The Daily Record'', 30 March 2007 (on The CillianSite)</ref>
