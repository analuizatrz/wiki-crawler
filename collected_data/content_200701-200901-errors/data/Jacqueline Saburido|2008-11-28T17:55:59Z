'''Jacqueline "Jacqui" Saburido''' (born  {{birth date and age|1978|10|20}}) is a victim and survivor of a [[drunk driving]] accident. She has publicized her own [[disfigurement]] to show the potential consequences of drunk driving<ref>http://www.helpjacqui.com/home.htm</ref>.

== Early life ==
The only child of Rosalia and Amadeo Saburido, she lived in [[Caracas, Venezuela]] for all of her childhood. Living with her father after her parents [[divorce]]d, she began studying engineering in the hope of taking over the family air conditioning business. 
In 1999, Saburido was struggling in college and decided to take a break. She took a trip to [[Texas]] to study the [[English language]].  

=== The Accident ===
In [[September 1999]], Saburido attended a birthday party near [[Austin, Texas]]. She and her friends decided to head home after a few hours. Saburido and her friends, Laura Guerrero, Johan Daal and Johanna Gil, accepted a ride home from a classmate, Natalia Chpytchak Bennett. [[Reginald Stephey]], a 17-year-old [[high school]] student, was on his way home after drinking beer with his friends at a party. On the outskirts of Austin, Stephey's 1996 [[Chevrolet Tahoe|GMC Yukon]] veered into Bennett's 1990 [[Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight]] Regency. Bennett's car was carrying Saburido and the others.

Guerrero and Bennett were killed instantly. Gil and Daal were injured but not seriously. Saburido's feet were trapped under the seat and she could not get out.  The car caught fire. Two [[paramedic]]s, John McIntosh and Bryan Fitzpatrick, happened to be driving past when Stephey flagged them down. The flames were leaping several feet up into the air as they arrived. McIntosh put out the fire with his extinguisher and the two men set about removing everyone from the vehicle.

Saburido was trapped, and the fire returned. McIntosh and Fitzpatrick were forced back, and Saburido was left to burn for around 45 seconds as the flames engulfed the vehicle. A fire truck arrived and put out the fire, Saburido was cut from the car and airlifted to the burns unit in [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]].

Saburido suffered burns<ref>http://www.varesano.net/blog/fabio/why+no+one+should+drink+and+drive+destiny+jacqueline+saburido</ref>, mainly third degree, to over 60 percent of her body. She survived, reportedly despite the expectations of her doctors. All of her fingers had to be amputated, but there was enough bone left on her thumb to construct an [[opposable thumb]]. She lost her hair, ears, nose, lips, left eyelid and much of her vision. She has undergone more than 40 operations since the crash, including [[cornea]] transplants, which have restored her left eye, and she has many more to go.

=== Aftermath ===
In [[June]] [[2001]], [[Reginald Stephey]] was convicted on two counts of [[vehicular homicide|intoxicated manslaughter]]. He was sentenced to two concurrent seven-year prison sentences inside [[Huntsville Unit]] and fined $20,000. An [[appeal]] was refused in [[2005]], he was released on [[june 24]],[[2008]] after serving his full seven year sentence<ref>http://www.txcn.com/sharedcontent/dws/txcn/austin/stories/062408kvuestephey-mm.374d710b.html</ref>.

Saburido allowed graphic post-accident photographs of herself to be used in the media (posters, TV commercials, and internet chain mail) to illustrate a possible outcome of drunk driving<ref>http://www.news8austin.com/content/top_stories/?ArID=56676</ref>. She is most well known for a commercial in which she holds a pre-accident photo of herself in front of the camera, which she lowers to reveal her disfigured face and says, "This is me, after being hit by a drunk driver."

Saburido appeared on ''[[Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' on [[November 17]], [[2003]]. She was also interviewed on the [[Australia]]n ''[[60 Minutes (Australian TV program)|60 Minutes]]'' on [[March 14]], [[2004]] and was featured in a [[Discovery Health]] documentary on [[face transplant]]s. She continues to educate people on drunk driving. [[Oprah Winfrey]] has called Saburido the one person she had met who defined "inner beauty".

Saburido's story was featured in the motivational presentation ''Inside Out'' by Motivational Productions.

Saburido is currently living in [[Kentucky]], to enable better transportation to her doctors. Her mother Rosalia has passed away from cancer.

=== Face transplant ===
Saburido is among the 20 disfigured people who have approached surgeons at a [[London]] hospital to carry out [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s first [[face transplant]] operation<ref>http://www.medindia.net/news/healthwatch/facialtransplant_controversies.asp</ref>. She is also looking into other possibilities for a face transplant in other nations and hospitals<ref>http://edition.cnn.com/2004/TECH/science/05/26/face.transplant/</ref><ref>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1505905/First-British-face-transplant-'within-a-year'.html</ref>.
