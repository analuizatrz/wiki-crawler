'''Tourist trap''' is a phrase for any establishment or set of establishments that have been created to attract travelers or [[tourists]] and provide products for the tourist to purchase.<ref>{{cite book

There is some ambiguity in the definition of the phrase as it relates to size, activities, cost of products, and legitimacy. Some operators prefer to call them "family-oriented tourist attractions".<ref>{{cite news

==Goods and activities==
Tourist traps provide an opportunity to separate a consumer from their [[money]] and are oriented primarily towards non-native or non-local consumers. Because the tourist is on her or his way to a particular attraction, the tourist trap will either offer a distinctly contrary experience or an allied experience.  They will offer up "unique" natural or artificial features (the "[[Biggest ball of twine|World's Largest Ball of Twine]]" or "[[Silver Springs Nature Theme Park|Silver Springs]]") that can only be had at the particular stop, and will then offer up conveniences or activities to entertain and capitalize upon the stopped tourist.

===Goods===
Typically goods available for purchase will include [[souvenir]]s and [[curiosities]] embossed with the name of the establishment and or local points of interest.  Additional products may include the normal range of items found in a [[Gift shop]].    

===Activities===
Activities at Tourist traps vary greatly based in part on the surrounding [[economy]] and [[infrastructure]]. In some areas like [[Ishpeming, Michigan]], [[Flush toilet]]s may be a sufficient draw to entice tourist to stop. In other locations like [[Anaheim, California]] more robust activates are required to draw a tourist to a specific activity over a [[competitor]]'s activity.  Other activities may include, [[thematic restaurant]]s, [[arcade game]]s, [[wax museum]]s, [[collection]]s of unique artifacts, and so on.

===Mule rides===

Cameron]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=C000066 | title= Cameron, Ralph Henry, (1863 -1953); Biographical Directory of the United States Congress}}</ref> a former resident of [[Maine]], traveled west with his brothers around [[1880]].  Arriving in [[Flagstaff, Arizona]] where they took up [[Sheep#Domestication|sheep herding]].  Ralph visited the nearby [[Grand Canyon]] and realizing its potential as a tourist trap began acquiring properties.  Before the [[Grand Canyon]] became a [[National Monument]] in 1906 the Cameron’s and accomplices had secured over 100 claims including some of the most scenic.   They improved an old Indian trail that would become [[Bright Angel Trail]] and began charging tourists a dollar toll.   For an additional fee you could rent a [[mule]] to take you to the bottom of the canyon.  At the bottom of the Grand Canyon the trapped tourist would have an opportunity to be [[Sheep shearing|sheared]] again as they were given an opportunity to hire a mule to carry them back to the top!  Other opportunities to separate tourists from their dollars included charging for [[Outhouse|comfort stations]].<ref>[http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/albright2/ Horace M.

==Size== 

Tourist traps range significantly in size, from a single tree<ref>{{cite web  | coauthors = Jarl & Carol de Boer   | title = The Eternal Tree House in Redcrest on the Redwood Highway  | work = TUNNELTREE and CALIFPOSTCARD Home Pages  | publisher =   | date =  © 2003   | url = http://www.tunneltree.com/redwood/hum-scot/eternal/eternal.html  | format = Web  | doi =  | accessdate = March 21, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web  | coauthors = Jarl & Carol de Boer

There may be valid arguments to include traps that are bigger or smaller than these as well.

==Stop and Shop==

A few establishments take pride in the term and embody it into their names, such as "Da Yoopers Tourist Trap"<ref>{{cite web   | title = Da Yoopers Tourist Trap & Museum  | work = Ishpeming, Michigan, Business web site  | url = http://www.dayoopers.com/thetrap.html  | format = Web   | accessdate = March 21, 2007 }}</ref> in [[Michigan]]’s [[Upper Peninsula]], and "The TOURIST TRAP"<ref name="Maryland">{{cite web   | title = The TOURIST TRAP  | work = Deep Creek Lake, Maryland, Business web site  | publisher =   | date = ©Copyright 2003 - The Tiurist Trap  | url = http://www.shoptouristtrap.com  | format = Web  | doi =  | accessdate =  March 21, 2007}}</ref> at [[Deep Creek Lake, Maryland]].  Other establishments like The "Trees of Mystery"<ref>{{cite web   | title = Trees of Mystery   | work = Klamath, California, Business web site   | publisher =  | date =  | url = http://www.treesofmystery.net   | format = Web  | doi =  | accessdate = March 21, 2007 }}</ref> in [[Klamath, California]] avoid the phrase.  If the term is embraced or not, regardless of the price of products, the two things that most tourist stops have in common are [[restroom]]s and items for sale with the name the establishment or other nearby [[points of interest]].

*An episode of ''[[Kojak]]'' titled "Tourist Trap" is about a crime boss conducting an [[illegal immigration]] scheme, to provide workers for businesses he owns.
*In the 1983 film ''[[National Lampoon's Vacation]]'', Ellen Griswold ridicules her husband, Clark, for being distracted trying to find attractions such as "the world's largest ball of twine" on their way to their actual destination, the fictional amusement park called "Wally World".
*The [[Adventure Game]] [[Sam and Max Hit the Road]] largely takes place at a series of tourist traps across the United States.
*In the novel [[American Gods]] by [[Neil Gaiman]], tourist traps are hypothesized to be built in areas of great spiritual energy in America, much like shrines or stone monoliths might mark such spots in other parts of the world.
