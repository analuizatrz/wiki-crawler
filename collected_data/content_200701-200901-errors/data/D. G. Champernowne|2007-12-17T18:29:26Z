'''David Gawen Champernowne''' ([[July 9]],[[1912]] - [[August 19]],[[2000]]) was Professor of Statistical Economics at Oxford (1948 -1959), and professor of Economics and Statistics at Cambridge (1970-2000). He published work on [[Champernowne constant|Champernowne's Number]] in 1933, while still an undergraduate at the [[University of Cambridge]].

After academic work at Cambridge and the [[London School of Economics]], he worked in the Prime Minister's Statistical department to supply quantitative information to help [[Winston Churchill]] make decisions. However, he did not get on well with the department head [[Frederick Lindemann|Lindemann]] and, in 1941, he moved on to become a programme director in the Ministry of Aircraft Production.

Working with an old college friend [[Alan Turing]] in 1948, he helped develop one of the first [[chess-playing computer program]]s.

The book for which he is most renowned, synthesising a life's work, ''Economic Inequality and Income Distribution (Cambridge University Press)'', was published in 1998.

His co-editors at the ''[[Economic Journal]]'' found him to be "modest, quirky and humorous". ''(Obituary - Guardian 1 Sept 2000, p18.)''

His grave is at the new Church at [[Dartington]], Devon, built by his family in the 1870s to replace the ancient Church at [[Dartington Hall]], the family seat.
