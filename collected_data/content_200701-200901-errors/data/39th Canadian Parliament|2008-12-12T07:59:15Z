== Overview ==
{{Canadian politics}}

The 39th Parliament was the longest minority government led by any federal government excepting the de facto majority led by Mackenzie King's Liberal Party in the [[16th Canadian Parliament|16th Parliament]].  No other Conservative minority has lasted a full year, and only Lester B. Pearson's governments lasted more than two.<ref>{{Cite web |author=Canada |publisher=Library of Parliament |accessdate=2008-09-02 |url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Parlinfo/compilations/parliament/DurationMinorityGovernment.aspx |title=Duration of Minority Governments}}</ref>

The 39th Parliament was controlled by a [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]] minority, led by [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] and the [[28th Canadian Ministry]], which assumed power on February 6, 2006.<ref name="prime minister">{{Cite web|author=Government of Canada|publisher=Library of Parliament| title=Prime Minister of Canada: Biographical Information| work=ParlInfo| accessdate=2007-11-04| url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Parlinfo/Compilations/FederalGovernment/PrimeMinisters/Biographical.aspx}}</ref>  The [[Official Opposition (Canada)|Official Opposition]] was the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]], led first by interim leader [[Bill Graham]], and then by [[Stéphane Dion]] for the remainder of the Parliament's life.<ref name="opposition leader">{{Cite web| author=Government of Canada| title=Leaders of the Opposition in the House of Commons| date=2006-02-24| accessdate=2006-11-30| publisher=Library of Parliament| url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/about/people/house/OppLeaderCareer.asp?Language=E&Hist=Y}}</ref>

The [[Speaker of the Canadian House of Commons|Speaker]] is Liberal [[Peter Milliken]].  Milliken was re-elected as the Speaker of the House for the 39th Parliament on April 3, 2006. The Speaker only votes in a tie, and, as Milliken is a Liberal, the Liberal caucus was effectively reduced by one.<ref name="house speakers"/>  This, along with the defection of [[Wajid Khan]] to the Conservatives enabled the Conservatives to pass legislation with the cooperation of any one of the three [[opposition parties]]: [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]], [[Bloc Québécois]], or [[New Democratic Party]] (NDP).

There had been two [[Parliamentary session|sessions]] of the 39th Parliament at its dissolution.<ref name="sessions">{{Cite web|author=Government of Canada|publisher=Library of Parliament| title=Parliaments - Duration of Sessions| work=ParlInfo| url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Parlinfo/compilations/parliament/Sessions.aspx|accessdate=2007-11-04}}</ref>

The party standings as elected and as of March 17, 2008, are on the table below.  Since the election, four members of the House of Commons [[crossed the floor]] (two of whom had previously been forced to sit as an independent), one died, eleven resigned, and nine members have been elected in by-elections to fill vacancies (one vacancy remains to be filled).  In that same period, two senators have died, six have resigned (four of whom had reached the mandatory retirement age), and one has been appointed to fill a vacancy (twelve vacancies remain).  Step-by-step changes are listed in the [[39th Canadian Parliament#Members|Members]] section.  See [[List of Canadian federal electoral districts]] for a list of the ridings in this parliament.

The Parliament was dissolved by Governor General Michaëlle Jean on the advice of Prime Minister Stephen Harper on September 7, 2008. The general election for the members of the 40th Parliament of Canada was held on October 14, 2008.

===Liberal leadership===
During the election campaign, the Liberal leader was then-Prime Minister [[Paul Martin]].   After the election results were announced, Martin announced his intention to resign, but did not indicate when, other than saying he would not lead the party into the next election. On February 1, 2006, the Liberal Party Caucus chose [[Bill Graham (politician)|Bill Graham]] as [[parliamentary leader]], meaning he served as [[Leader of the Opposition (Canada)|Leader of the Opposition]] in the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]] until the election of [[Stéphane Dion]] as Liberal leader at the Liberal Party leadership convention, held December 2-3, 2006.

On March 18, 2006 Martin tendered his resignation as Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada.<ref>{{cite web

===Five priorities===
[[Image:Harper,-Stephen-Jan-23-06.jpg|thumb|left|[[Stephen Harper]] is Prime Minister during the 39th Canadian Parliament.  He is seen here giving his victory speech after the 2006 federal election which ended thirteen years of Liberal rule.]]
Prime Minister Harper said he would move forward with his top five priorities from the campaign.  At least four of these would require legislative action: the passage of a ''[[Federal Accountability Act]]'' in response to the [[sponsorship scandal]]; setting longer [[mandatory sentencing|mandatory sentences]]; lowering the [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|Goods & Services Tax]] to 6% (and eventually to 5%); giving $1,200 for parents per child under the age of 6; and negotiating with the provinces to shorten wait-times<ref>http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/parliament39/priorities.html</ref> (this priority was eventually replaced with combating crime by creating more police officers).  The child allowance and first GST were in place by July 1, 2006<ref>http://www.fin.gc.ca/budget06/brief/briefe.htm</ref>.  On December 6, 2006, another issue many expected to arise in the first session of parliament did, in fact, come to the fore, when the government introduced a motion calling "on the government to introduce legislation to restore the traditional definition of marriage without affecting civil unions and while respecting existing same-sex marriages."  The next day, the House defeated the motion by a vote of 175 to 123, with six cabinet ministers voting against it, and Harper declared the issue settled.<ref>{{cite news |first=Gloria |last=Galloway |title=Same-sex marriage file closed for good, PM says |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20061208.SAMESEX08/TPStory/?query=%22same-sex+marriage%22 |format=fee required |publisher=globeandmail.com |date=2006-08-12 |accessdate=2007-11-04 }}</ref> (See [[Members of the 39th Canadian Parliament and same-sex marriage]] for more information.) and on January 1, 2008 the second GST reduction came into effect<ref>http://www.financialpost.com/story.html?id=d2e3014c-f5c5-498e-8d23-90ee5ebad2a4&k=80343</ref>.  The Federal Accountability Act received Royal Assent on December 12, 2006

=== Resignations and By-elections ===

On September 20, 2006 Liberal MP [[Joe Fontana]] ([[London North Centre]]) resigned to run in the London mayoralty election. Fontana was replaced in the riding by Liberal [[Glen Pearson]] after a by-election on November 27, 2006.<ref>{{cite web

Liberal MP [[Jean Lapierre]] declared on January 11, 2007 that he would resign from the Liberal Party at the end of the month to pursue a career in television. This took place on January 28, leaving the [[Outremont (federal electoral district)|Outremont]] district vacant. On July 28, Prime Minister Stephen Harper called [[by-elections]] for this and two other Quebec ridings, which were held on September 17, 2007. Newcomer NDP candidate [[Thomas Mulcair]] won this riding over star Liberal candidate Jocelyn Coulon, only the second-ever time Outremont has not been won by a Liberal candidate. Mulcair was previously a Provincial Liberal Cabinet Minister in Quebec.<ref>{{cite web| title =Federal NDP recruits former Quebec Liberal minister| publisher =  CBC 2007| date = September 18, 2007| url =http://www.cbc.ca/canada/montreal/story/2007/04/20/mulcair-ndp.html| accessdate = 2007-12-02 }}</ref>

On March 8, 2007, Liberal MP [[Jim Peterson]] announced that he would not be a candidate in his [[Willowdale (electoral district)|Willowdale]] riding in the next federal election. On June 20, 2007, Peterson followed Bill Graham's lead and announced his resignation from the House of Commons, effective July 12.

==Major bills and motions==
Important business of the 39th Parliament includes the following [[Bill (proposed law)|bills]] and [[Motion (democracy)|motions]].  Note that not all of these bills have yet become law.  Motions (excepting those which pass bills) have no effect in law.  A complete list of bills of the 39th Parliament is on the Parliament's website, divided into bills from the [http://www.parl.gc.ca/LEGISINFO/index.asp?Language=E&Session=14 1st] and [http://www.parl.gc.ca/LEGISINFO/index.asp?Language=E&Session=15 2nd] sessions.  On the site, the bills are divided into government bills, [[private member's bill]]s, and [[private bill]]s for both the House and the Senate.

===Acts passed by 39th Parliament===
=====Federal Accountability Act=====
Bill C-2, the [[Federal Accountability Act]] (officially ''"An Act providing for conflict of interest rules, restrictions on election financing and measures respecting administrative transparency, oversight and accountability"''), received [[Royal Assent]] in the Senate on December 12, 2006, and is now becoming law.  The act plans to reduce the opportunity to exert influence with money by banning corporate, union, and large personal political donations; create a five-year lobbying ban on former ministers, their aides, and senior public servants; provide protection for whistleblowers; and enhancing the power for the [[Auditor General]] to follow the money spent by the government.

===Failed acts and motions===
=====Re-opening the same-sex marriage debate=====
{{main|Members of the 39th Canadian Parliament and same-sex marriage}}
A government motion to reopen the [[same-sex marriage]] debate failed.  The [[38th Canadian Parliament]], led by the Liberals, had legalized same-sex marriage a year earlier.  Several provinces had legalized same-sex marriage before that. During his campaign,  Harper promised a parliamentary vote on reopening the issue. The motion failed 175-123 leaving the same-sex marriage legal in Canada and the legal debate about it closed.<ref>{{Cite news |author=Canadian Press |authorlink=Canadian Press |publisher=CBC.ca |title=MPs vote against revisiting gay marriage issue |date=2006-12-07 |accessdate=2006-12-11 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/cp/national/061207/n120751A.html}}</ref>

The bill was reintroduced as a Commons bill on November 13, 2007 and is currently at second reading stage in the House.

=====Senate Appointment Consultations Act=====

=====Expanding the House of Commons=====
Bill C-22 (previously Bill C-56), titled ''"An Act to amend the Constitution Act, 1867 (Democratic representation)"'' is a bill which would add 22 seats to the House of Commons. This would increase the number to 330 seats, although these seats probably will not be in use until at least 2014. Under the proposed plan, [[Ontario]] would gain ten seats, [[British Columbia]] would get another seven seats, and [[Alberta]] would receive another five seats. The bill did not pass by the end of the 1st session of parliament, and was reintroduced in the 2nd session. The bill is currently at second reading stage, with an amendment by the Bloc being debated. <ref>{{cite web |title=Bill C-22: Status of the Bill |work:LEGISINFO |publisher=Library of Parliament |date=2008-06-17 |url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/legisinfo/index.asp?Language=E&Session=14&query=4965&List=toc |accessdate=2008-06-17}}</ref>

=====Income Tax Amendments Act, 2006=====
{{main|Income Tax Amendments Act, 2006}}
Bill C-10 (previously Bill C-33), among a long list of minor changes to tax law contains a controversial clause that would give the government power to deny taxation benefits for films made in Canada if the government deems the content to be objectionable. Critics{{Who|date=August 2008}} of the clause argue that it is equivalent to censorship because most Canadian films cannot afford to be produced without government assistance. The Bill was passed in the House October 29, 2007, but opposition parties later said that they did not not notice the controversial part and several Senators have said that they intend to send the Bill back to the House.
