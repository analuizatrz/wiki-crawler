'''Interstate 355''' (I-355), also known as the '''Veterans Memorial Tollway''', is an [[interstate highway]] and [[toll road|tollway]] in the western and southwest suburbs of [[Chicago]],&nbsp;[[Illinois]], [[United States|U.S.]] Like other tollways in the northeastern portion of the state, I-355 is maintained by the [[Illinois State Toll Highway Authority]] (abbreviated ISTHA, but commonly referred to as the "tollway authority"). I-355 runs from [[Interstate 80 in Illinois|Interstate 80]] in [[New Lenox, Illinois|New Lenox]] north to [[Interstate 290 (Illinois)|Interstate 290]] in [[Itasca, Illinois|Itasca]],<ref name="t2" /> a distance of {{convert|32.5|mi|km|1}}.<ref name="length_note" /> The highway is six lanes wide for its entire length.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&time=&date=&ttype=&q=I-355&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=28.611123,59.765625&ie=UTF8&ll=41.900999,-88.041&spn=0.20954,0.692139&t=h&z=11&om=1|title=General satellite view of the 3-laned I-355 (hybrid view to indicate where the highway is)|publisher=[[Google Maps]]|accessdate=2007-12-17}}</ref>

The tollway authority opened I-355 as the '''North–South Tollway''' in 1989 to ease congestion on [[Illinois Route 53]] (IL 53), a parallel two-lane state highway in central [[DuPage County, Illinois|DuPage County]]. Initially, I-355 ran from [[Interstate 55 in Illinois|Interstate 55]] north to I-290. The new highway helped cut travel times for commuters traveling north and south in the county. According to commercial real estate developers at the time, the new tollway also opened the western suburbs of Chicago to commercial and industrial development.<ref name="hausner_1989" />

On November 11,&nbsp;2007, the tollway authority opened a southern extension of I-355 from I-55 to I-80, a distance of {{convert|12.5|mi|km|1}}; on its opening, the tollway authority changed the name of the tollway to "Veterans Memorial Tollway". The tollway authority laid the route of the new extension through [[Will County, Illinois|Will County]] and a small portion of [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], one of the fastest-growing regions in Illinois. The tollway authority expects the extension to cut travel times in the region by 20 percent.<ref name="tollway_I355_south_extension" />

=== Early history ===
From the late 1920s through 1963, the two-lane-wide Rohlwing Road (also known as SBI Route 53, and later Illinois 53) serviced the north&ndash;south transportation corridor that includes eastern portions of DuPage County.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.us-highways.com/chiche.jpg|year=1928|publisher=[[Rand McNally & Company]]|title=Southwestern Chicago Map|work=US-Highways|accessdate=2008-01-21}}</ref> From 1963 to 1970, the [[Illinois Department of Transportation]] (IDOT) planned and built a new expressway north from [[Army Trail Road]] through Schaumburg to the Northwest Tollway (now the Jane Addams Memorial Tollway). After its completion, IDOT rerouted Illinois 53 onto this new expressway from Rohlwing Road.<ref name="rand_mcnally_1967">{{cite web|url=http://www.broermapsonline.org/members/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/Midwest/Illinois/Chicago/gousha_ra_1967_041.html|title= Chicago Vicinity Map|year=1967|work=Broer Map Library|publisher=Rand McNally & Company|accessdate=2007-11-28}}</ref><ref name=NBI>[[National Bridge Inventory]], a database compiled by the [[United States Department of Transportation]] [[Federal Highway Administration]], available at [http://www.nationalbridges.com nationalbridges.com].

The original alignment of I-355 was defined in the Chicago Area Transportation Study (abbreviated CATS) Transportation Plan of April&nbsp;1962. The plan called for a supplemental system of limited-access expressways to be built in the Chicago metropolitan area by 1980, and defined corridors where the expressways were to be located. Most of these corridors, including the [[Des Plaines River]] expressway, the [[Crosstown Expressway (Chicago)|Crosstown Expressway]] running north–south along the west side of Chicago, and most of a proposed northern extension of Illinois 53 were scrapped due to intense local opposition.<ref name="cats_history">{{cite web |url=http://www.catsmpo.com/pub/reports/history/cats_1954-62.pdf |title=The Chicago Area Transportation Study: Creating the First Plan (1955-1962) |year=2007 |accessdate=2007-12-27 |author=Plummer, Andy|format=PDF}}</ref>

Initially, state and county officials anticipated building a freeway for the expressway south of Army Trail Road, similar to the existing freeway north of Army Trail Road. In 1979, Chicago mayor [[Jane Byrne]] canceled proposed plans for the Crosstown Expressway. Following the move, Congress gave the rights of half of the $200&nbsp;million (1979, $568&nbsp;million in 2007) that had been earmarked for the Crosstown Expressway to DuPage County. However, county officials found this amount insufficient for construction of the new freeway. The officials then handed authority for the project over to the tollway authority, and spent the money on other projects in the county.<ref name="tribune_19850306">{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0FF631DCAC71B6FD&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated4&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Buzzard highway |date=1985-03-06 |author=Chicago Tribune Editorial Board |publisher=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=2008-01-11}}</ref>

In June&nbsp;1984, Republican minority leader of the [[Illinois House of Representatives]] [[James Philip|James "Pate" Philip]] helped push through legislation authorizing the construction of the tollway, then referred to as simply the DuPage Tollway.<ref name="tribune_19850129">{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0FF63074C2D99424&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated4&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title="Sox, DuPage batting stadium idea around" |author=Chicago Tribune |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=1985-01-29 |accessdate=2008-01-11}}</ref> Officials at the [[Morton Arboretum]], one of the nation's premier woodland research centers, promptly filed a federal lawsuit to block construction of the tollway.

In April&nbsp;1985, the two agencies came to an agreement regarding construction of the new tollway. To protect the arboretum from salt spray and other pollutants caused by cars on the tollway, the tollway authority agreed to build I-355 below grade around the perimeter of the arboretum. The tollway authority would build a water collection system to divert runoff from the arboretum. In addition, they would build earthen berms along the new road, preventing salt spray from damaging arboretum plants. In exchange, the DuPage County Forest Preserve District agreed to a 99-year lease providing {{convert|189|acre|km2|lk=on}} of its land to the arboretum for the development of a "urban vegetation laboratory". Under the agreement, Morton Arboretum agreed to charge DuPage County residents lower admissions one day of the week, build a bicycle path connecting the arboretum to nearby forest preserves, and begin a joint clean-streams program to improve the water quality of DuPage County's lakes and streams.<ref name="schmeltzer_1985" /> In January&nbsp;1986, the tollway paid out $2.5&nbsp;million (1986, $4.7&nbsp;million in 2007) to a trust fund as a part of the settlement to help finance the arboretum's new programs.<ref name="schmetlzer_19860129">{{cite news |title=Tollway gives $2.5 million to arboretum |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0FF66DF9A24634AB&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated4&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |author=Schmeltzer, John |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=1986-01-29 |accessdate=2008-01-11}}</ref>

The [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] released a preliminary [[environmental impact statement]] on March 13,&nbsp;1986. At a public hearing a month later, arboretum executives and [[Woodridge, Illinois|Woodridge]] officials strongly criticized the report as "fatally flawed" and a repeat of tollway-provided research, including typographical errors. The opposition also cited outdated and inaccurate data regarding wetlands replacement, salt dispersion, and the lack of compensation to residents for lowered property values.<ref name="schmeltzer_19860410">{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0FF67134D778B245&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated4&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Toll road impact report blasted |author=Schmeltzer, John |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=1986-04-10 |accessdate=2008-01-11}}</ref> The tollway authority agreed to run the road below-grade at 75th&nbsp;Street instead of as a {{convert|28|ft|m|sing=on}} high elevated highway.

The Corps of Engineers issued a permit for the tollway on October 8,&nbsp;1986, rejecting last-minute concerns from the [[Sierra Club]] to reroute the toll road around sections of Churchill Woods Prairie, between [[Glen Ellyn, Illinois|Glen Ellyn]] and [[Lombard, Illinois|Lombard]]. The permit allowed the first two earth moving contracts issued by the tollway authority to move forward.<ref name="schmeltzer_19861009">{{cite news |author=Schmeltzer, John |title=Bulldozers rev up for a tollway |accessdate=2008-01-11 |date=1986-10-09 |publisher=Chicago Tribune |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0FF679AB9F4933BE&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated4&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2}}</ref> The tollway authority put the total cost of {{convert|17.7|mi|km|1}} of new pavement at $450&nbsp;million (1987, $817&nbsp;million in 2007).

Due to problems with pavement on other roads in the system and anticipating heavy traffic on the new Interstate, the tollway authority decided to pave I-355 with pavement expected to last 20&nbsp;years. Construction workers laid concrete on the tollway to a thickness of {{convert|12|in|cm|0}} over an 8-inch (20&nbsp;cm) sub-base. The new pavement also incorporated [[fly ash]] and less cement, allowing the pavement to achieve maximum strength faster than pure concrete.<ref name="mehler_19880426">{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0FF7DE3D48534006&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated4&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Tollway tries to get rock-solid pavement |date=1988-04-26 |accessdate=2008-01-11 |author=Mehler, Neil H. |publisher=Chicago Tribune}}</ref>

One of the last issues settled prior to the opening of the tollway was the highway's number. Originally, tollway officials designated the new road I-355. Early in 1988, however, the tollway administration received a letter from the [[Federal Highway Administration]] (FHWA) indicating that the highway should be named Interstate&nbsp;455. FHWA policy at the time dictated that auxiliary Interstate routes that join two other Interstate highways should start with an even number. IDOT argued the highway more closely resembles a spur from I-55.<ref name="cuhry_19880730">{{cite news |author=Cuhry, Daniel |publisher=The Daily Herald (Arlington Heights, IL) |url=http://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=%22six+months+ago+Illinois+State+Toll+&btnG=Search+Archives&num=50&lr=&as_ldate=1988&as_hdate=1988|date=1988-07-30 |accessdate=2008-01-24 |title=Numbers game keeps tollway nameless}}</ref> Ultimately, the tollway authority kept the I-355 designation.

Governor [[James R. Thompson]] and U.S. [[Secretary of Transportation]] [[Samuel K. Skinner]] dedicated the North–South Tollway on December 22,&nbsp;1989. When it opened, officials estimated travel times from Schaumburg to Oak Brook would be reduced from 55&nbsp;minutes to 34&nbsp;minutes, and from Wheaton to [[Darien, Illinois|Darien]] from 60 to 34&nbsp;minutes. Tollway officials also estimated that 200,000&nbsp;cars per day would use I-355.<ref name="hausner_1989">{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0EB36E9125B5C3D7&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated4&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |author=Hausner, Les |publisher=Chicago Sun Times |date=1989-12-22 |accessdate=2008-01-11 |title=Opening of I-355 will put some zip in Du Page traffic}}</ref> This figure has since been shown to be slightly optimistic, with maximum average daily traffic values approaching 170,200 only at the northern end of the Interstate.

I-355 opened at the stroke of midnight on December 24,&nbsp;1989. As a Christmas "gift", the first two days of operation were free.<ref name="hausner_1989" /> Due to lower traffic counts at the north and south ends of the highway and lack of construction money, tollway officials built the road with four lanes from North Avenue&nbsp;([[Illinois Route 64]]) to the [[Ronald Reagan Memorial Tollway]]&nbsp;([[Interstate 88 (west)|Interstate 88]]) on the north end, and around I-55 on the south end. As early as 1991, tollway officials had drawn up plans to widen the highway to three lanes in each direction.<ref name="szymczak">{{cite news |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=1991-12-25 |accessdate=2008-01-11 |author=Szymczak, P.

After the new road opened, congestion decreased considerably on nearby north–south arteries. The DuPage County Division of Transportation calculated that congestion had decreased on Illinois&nbsp;53 by 20%, and the volume of cars on nearby north–south roads Illinois&nbsp;53, [[Illinois Route 59|Illinois&nbsp;59]] and [[Illinois Route 83|Illinois&nbsp;83]] had decreased. On Illinois&nbsp;53 between Ogden Avenue and Roosevelt Road, traffic counts sank from 21,400 to 11,800&nbsp;vehicles per day. In addition, traffic on the exit ramp from the [[Tri-State Tollway]]&nbsp;([[Interstate 294]]) to I-55 dropped 10% in 12&nbsp;months.

Unlike the other tollways in the tollway system, there are no [[Illinois Tollway Oasis|oases]] on the North–South Tollway.

In addition to the original alignment of I-355, the Transportation Plan of April&nbsp;1962 included the concept of a route that ran from [[Bolingbrook, Illinois|Bolingbrook]] south to [[Joliet, Illinois|Joliet]]. After the northern portion of I-355 opened in 1989, the [[Illinois General Assembly]] authorized the tollway authority to begin studying the southern extension of I-355.<ref name=herald_timeline>{{cite news |title=Tollway timeline |date=2007-11-11 |accessdate=2008-01-11 |author=The Herald News |publisher=The Herald News (Joliet, IL) |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:JHNB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=11D34AA8AA1B9250&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated4&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2}}</ref><ref name = "rmcn"/>

The discovery of the [[Hine's Emerald Dragonfly]], an endangered species, and related concerns for the environmental health of the Des Plaines River wetlands in 1995, ignited a series of legal challenges that delayed construction of the I-355 extension for several years. The [[Sierra Club]] filed a lawsuit in 1996 to block planning of the southern extension. In January&nbsp;1997, a federal judge sided with the Sierra Club, halting construction of the southern extension while the state appealed. In 1999, the state dropped its appeal and amended the environmental impact study (EIS) to meet the Sierra Club's concerns.<ref name=herald_timeline /> The state released the supplemental EIS in 2000, and in 2002 the FHWA issued a Record of Decision, allowing construction of the tollway to proceed after six years of delays. Land acquisition and utility relocation took place in 2004. Governor [[Rod Blagojevich]]'s $5.6&nbsp;billion Congestion-Relief Program for the Illinois Tollway passed the General Assembly in September&nbsp;2004, with $729.3&nbsp;million being set aside for the extension.<ref name=congestion-relief>{{cite web |url=http://www.illinoistollway.com/pls/portal/url/ITEM/125BFC01743142A898A446A31484DAE1 |title=Congestion-Relief Program Summary |publisher=Illinois State Toll Highway Authority |author=Illinois State Toll Highway Authority |year=2007 |accessdate=2007-11-15}}</ref> Bidding on an excavation contract passed on November 18, 2004 with construction beginning several days later.<ref name=tribune_may07>{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=1191C375AFE907A8&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated4&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |publisher=Chicago Tribune |work=NewsBank Inc|title=Bridge to southwest around the corner |author=Ziemba, Stanley |accessdate=2008-01-11 |date=2007-05-13 }}</ref> 

To document and reduce the impact of construction on the dragonfly's habitat, construction crews agreed to keep carcasses of any dragonfly kills. In addition, the tollway authority funded the construction of separate habitats for the dragonfly near the Waterfall Glen Forest Preserve in [[Lemont, Illinois|Lemont]] and in two other preserves in Cook and Will counties.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbc5.com/news/11113073/detail.html |work=[[WMAQ-TV]]|publisher=Chicago Sun-Times |date=2007-02-26 |accessdate=2007-03-15 |title=Endangered Dragonfly Relocated For Interstate}}</ref> In late&nbsp;2005, construction began on the roadway of the {{convert|12.5|mi|km|1}} long southern extension of I-355 from I-55 in Bolingbrook to I-80 in New Lenox.<ref name="tollway_I355_south_extension">{{cite web |url=http://www.illinoistollway.com/portal/page?_pageid=133,1401899&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL |year=2007 |author=Illinois Tollway |accessdate=2007-11-17 |title=I355 South Extension}}</ref>

Another controversy erupted in February&nbsp;2006, when the tollway authority threatened to build the tollway with no interchanges unless the suburbs through which the new extension ran contributed $20&nbsp;million for construction of the interchanges. This marked the first time that the tollway authority had required local municipalities to contribute funds for interchange construction.<ref name=ziemba_200602>{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=10F9784D3100AD80&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated4&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=A tollway that has no exits? |publisher=Chicago Tribune |author=Ziemba, Stanley |date=2006-02-05 |accessdate=2008-01-11 }}</ref> The towns of Homer Glen, Lemont, New Lenox, Lockport and Will County agreed in a June&nbsp;2006 intergovernmental agreement to provide $20&nbsp;million in both cash and [[in-kind]] contributions for the interchanges.<ref name=cain_2006>{{cite news |publisher=Chicago Sun Times |title=County to vote on I-355 local contribution plan |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:NPSB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=115FF103C90E2D20&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated4&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |date=2006-06-02 |accessdate=2008-01-11 |author=Cain, Cindy Wojdyla}}</ref>

The village of New Lenox estimates that it will receive an additional $12&nbsp;million in sales taxes after its two malls are built out. In Lockport, officials have announced that new [[Home Depot]] and [[SuperTarget]] stores are planned for the areas near 159th&nbsp;Street and I-355.

One of "the most impressive engineering feats on the state's {{convert|274|mi|km|0}} of toll roads"<ref name="tribune_may07" /> is the [[Des Plaines River Valley Bridge]], a bridge over the Des Plaines River, the [[Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal]], the [[Illinois and Michigan Canal]], Bluff Road, New Avenue, numerous railroads, and a major Commonwealth Edison utility corridor. The bridge is {{convert|1.3|mi|km|1}} long, and constituted $125&nbsp;million of the cost of the extension. Work on the bridge included the construction of 34&nbsp;piers and elevation of existing high-voltage electricity lines to accommodate the highway.<ref name="tollway_I355_south_extension"/> To limit the number of piers in the valley, the tollway authority built the bridge with both {{convert|170|ft|m|0}} pre-stressed bulb tee girders and {{convert|270|ft|m|0}} post-tensioned segmental concrete girders. This was $12&nbsp;million cheaper than the concrete box girder design option, and $50&nbsp;million less than the steel plate girder design option. A [[design-build]] clause in the original contract for the bridge, in addition to success in the design-build contracts on the 2004-2007 [[Tri-State Tollway]] widening and reconstruction, allowed project managers to redesign and build the new bridge.<ref name="concrete_products">{{cite web |url=http://concreteproducts.com/mag/concrete_prairie_passage/ |title=Prairie Passage |publisher=Concrete Products |author=Marsh, Don |date=2007-10-01 |accessdate=2007-11-15}}</ref>

== Route description ==
[[Image:Interstate 355 map.png|thumb|250px|Detailed map of I-355]]
The southern terminus of I-355 is northeast of New Lenox, where the highway intersects I-80. I-355 is routed north and slightly west through rural, hilly portions of Will County. Just after the US 6 interchange (mile 1.0), tollway drivers pay a toll at Spring Creek Toll Plaza, the only toll plaza on the southern extension of I-355. It continues north through the rural sections of Will County, having exits that serve the towns of [[Homer Glen, Illinois|Homer Glen]] and [[Lockport, Illinois|Lockport]]. At 135th&nbsp;Street (approximately mile 8.0) in Lemont, Interstate 355 briefly enters Cook County. After an interchange at 127th&nbsp;Street (mile 9.0), I-355 crosses over the Des Plaines River on the [[Des Plaines River Valley Bridge]] before returning to Will County. Shortly north of the bridge, I-355 intersects I-55 at Bolingbrook (mile 12.5). Multiple [[flyover ramp]]s connect all directions of both highways.<ref name="current_tollway_map" /><ref name="maps">[[Google Maps]] street maps and [[USGS]] [[topographic map]]s, accessed January&nbsp;2008 via [http://mapper.acme.com/ ACME Mapper]</ref><ref name="rmcn">{{Cite map|publisher=Rand McNally|title=The Road Atlas|year=2006|page=46}}</ref>

North of I-55, I-355 continues to run almost due north through the established western suburbs of Chicago in [[DuPage County, Illinois|DuPage County]]. Travelers pay another toll just north of Boughton Road, at the Boughton Road Toll Plaza (mile 13.5). Continuing north, I-355 has another multiple flyover interchange with [[Interstate 88 (west)|I-88]] (miles 19.5 and 23.0), officially designated the [[Ronald Reagan Memorial Tollway]]. On the southern end of the interchange, northbound I-355 has exits to both directions of I-88. I-355 then swings below I-88 and runs side-by-side with the other tollway for {{convert|1|mi|km|0}}. Southbound exits to both directions of I-88 are at the northern end of the interchange. At the Army Trail Road Toll Plaza (mile 29.0), through traffic pays the last toll of the tollway. I-355 has no tolls north of the Army Trail Road exit (mile 30) in [[Addison, Illinois|Addison]]. There is one untolled exit (mile 31.5) at [[U.S. Route 20]] (Lake Street) north of the tollway. I-355 terminates at the I-290 interchange near the border of the villages of Itasca and [[Addison, Illinois|Addison]].<ref name="current_tollway_map" /><ref name="maps"/><ref name="rmcn" />

The northernmost two toll plazas (Boughton Road and Army Trail Road) charge $1.00&nbsp;cash and $0.50 for cars with I-PASS and [[E-ZPass]].
