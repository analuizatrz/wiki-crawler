}}The '''Altamaha-ha''' is an [[Aquatic animal|aquatic]] [[cryptid]] reported from the myriad network of small [[stream]]s and abandoned [[rice field]]s near the mouth of the [[Altamaha River]] (after which it has been named) in southeastern [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[United States]], particularly around [[Darien, Georgia|Darien]] and elsewhere in [[McIntosh County, Georgia|McIntosh County]]. Those who claim to have seen it report it to be 10 to 50 feet in length. No physical evidence has been reported.

The Altamaha-ha often described as having [[snake]] or [[eel|eel-like]] qualities (being reported in waterways where ordinary-sized eel species are common) and is said to traverse the river and streams in an undulating fashion with 2-3 "humps." It is said to have a [[tail]] that is horizontal, rather than vertical, like that of a [[porpoise]].

There have been many reports of such a creature in southeastern Georgia (and a smaller number of similar reports in [[Florida]]) going back to at least the [[1700s]]. The local [[Tama (Amerindian tribe)|Tama]] Indian tribe has legends of a giant, snake-like creature inhabiting the waters of and near the Altamaha River that presumably pre-date English settlement of the Georgia coast.

Some have speculated that the Altamaha-ha may be an oceanic [[cryptid]] which engages in reproductive [[spawning]] in the fresh waters in and around the Altamaha River. In any event, there have been several reports of what appear to be [[juvenile (organism)|juvenile]] specimens of the creature, in addition to the more numerous sightings of what are presumed to be adults.
