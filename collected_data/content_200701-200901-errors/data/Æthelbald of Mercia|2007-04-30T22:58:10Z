[[Image:Repton crypt.jpg|thumb|350px|An 1841 print of the crypt under the church at Repton, where Ethelbald was buried.]]'''Ethelbald''' (or '''Æthelbald''') (died [[757]]) was the [[List of monarchs of Mercia|King]] of [[Mercia]] in [[England]] from [[716]] until he was murdered by his bodyguard in 757.  His long reign began a period of Mercian domination of England, which was continued by [[Offa of Mercia|Offa]], who reigned from 757 to 796.

Ethelbald came to the throne on the death of [[Ceolred of Mercia|Ceolred]].  Both [[Wessex]] and [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]] were ruled by strong kings at that time, but within fifteen years Ethelbald is described by [[Bede]] as ruling all England south of the [[Humber]].  Oddly, Ethelbald is not listed as a [[bretwalda]], or "Ruler of Britain", in the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]], though this may be an error on the annalist's part.

In a letter sent in about 745, Ethelbald was reproved by [[Saint Boniface|St Boniface]] for various dissolute and irreligious acts.  The subsequent council at Clovesho, in 747, and a charter Ethelbald issued at Gumley in 749, which freed the church from some obligations, may have been reforms begun in response to Boniface's letter.

Ethelbald was killed in 757 by his bodyguard.  He was succeeded briefly by [[Beornrad of Mercia|Beornrad]], of whom little is known, but within a year Offa had taken the throne.

==Early life and accession==
Ethelbald was the son of Alweo and was a grandson of [[Eowa of Mercia|Eowa]], a brother of [[Penda of Mercia|Penda]].  Ethelbald spent his early years exiled from Mercia, according to the ''Life'' of [[Guthlac|Guthlac of Crowland]], who often provided him and his followers shelter.  Guthlac prophesied greatness for him, and Ethelbald later rewarded Guthlac with a shrine when he had become king.<ref name=Campbell_95>{{cite book |last= Campbell|first= John|coauthors= John, Eric & Wormald, Patrick|title= The Anglo-Saxons|pages=95|year= 1991|publisher= Penguin Books|isbn=0-14-014395-5}}</ref>  Bishop Haedde of [[Lichfield]], an influential Mercian, was also a visitor of Guthlac's, and it may be that Guthlac's support was politically useful to Ethelbald in gaining the throne.<ref name=Campbell_94>{{cite book |last= Campbell|first= John|coauthors= John, Eric & Wormald, Patrick|title= The Anglo-Saxons|pages=94|year= 1991|publisher= Penguin Books|isbn=0-14-014395-5}}</ref>  [[Ceolred of Mercia|Ceolred]], a grandson of Penda's, and hence a second cousin of Ethelbald's, was king of Mercia until 716; when he died of a fit at a banquet,<ref name=Whitelock_177>{{cite book |last= Whitelock|first= Dorothy|title= English Historical Documents: Vol. 1 c500-1042|pages=755|year= 1968|publisher= Oxford University Press}}</ref> Ethelbald returned to Mercia and became king.<ref>It is possible that a king named Ceolwald, perhaps a brother of Ceolred, reigned for a short while between Ceolred and Ethelbald: {{cite book |last= Yorke|first= Barbara|title= Kings and Kingdoms of Early Anglo-Saxon England|pages=111|year= 1990|publisher= Seaby|isbn=1-85264-027-8}}; {{cite book |last= Kirby|first= D.P.|title= The Earliest English Kings|pages=129|year= 1991|publisher= Unwin Hyman|isbn=0-04-445692-1}}</ref>

==Mercian dominance==
Ethelbald's accession marked the beginning of a long period of Mercian dominance, which would last till the end of the eighth century.<ref name=BlairRBaEE_168>{{cite book |last= Blair|first= Peter Hunter|title= Roman Britain and Early England: 55 B.C. - A.D. 871|pages=168|year= 1966|publisher= W.W. Norton & Company|isbn=0-393-00361-2}}</ref>  For eighty years, from 716, when Ethelbald came to the throne, until the death of [[Offa of Mercia|Offa]] in 796, Mercia was ruled by two strong kings, with [[Beornrad of Mercia|Beornrad]]'s very brief reign of less than a year between the two in 757.<ref name=Swanton_46>Beornrad was "put to flight" by Offa in one version of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle; according to another, he held the kingdom for "a little while, and unhappily".  {{cite book |last= Swanton|first= Michael|title= The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle|pages=46-50|year= 1996|publisher= Routledge|isbn=0-415-92129-5}}</ref>  These long reigns are surprising at this early date: during the same period there were eleven kings in [[Northumbria]], many of them dying violent deaths.<ref name=BlairAITASE_52>{{cite book |last= Blair|first= Peter Hunter|title= An Introduction to Anglo-Saxon England|pages=755|year= 1960|publisher= Cambridge University Press}}</ref>

[[Image:Aethelbald charter Cyneberht 736.jpg|thumb|300px|The ''[[Ismere Diploma]]'', a charter of King Aethelbald's to Ealdorman Cyneberht in 736.]]At the start of this period, [[Wessex]] and [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]] were ruled by strong kings; [[Ine of Wessex|Ine]] and [[Wihtred of Kent|Wihtred]], respectively.  Wihtred of Kent died in 725, and Ine of Wessex, one of the most formidable rulers of his day, abdicated in 726 to go on a pilgrimage to Rome.  According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, his successor, [[Aethelheard of Wessex|Aethelheard]], fought that year with Oswald.<ref name=Swanton_42>{{cite book |last= Swanton|first= Michael|title= The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle|pages=42-43|year= 1996|publisher= Routledge|isbn=0-415-92129-5}}</ref> There are subsequent indications that Aethelheard ruled subject to Mercian authority, and it may be that Ethelbald helped establish both Aethelheard and his brother, Cuthred, who succeeded Aethelheard in 739.<ref name=Kirby_133>{{cite book |last= Kirby|first= D.P.|title= The Earliest English Kings|pages=133|year= 1990|publisher= Routledge|isbn=0044456921}}</ref> There is also charter evidence from Kent showing that Ethelbald was in control of London, and a patron of Kentish churches.<ref name=Campbell_95 />  By 731, [[Bede]] was able to summarize a list of bishops in office in southern England by adding that "all these provinces, together with the others south of the river Humber and their kings, are subject to Ethelbald, King of the Mercians."<ref name=Bede_PC_324>Translation by Leo Sherley-Price in {{cite book |last= Bede|title= Ecclesiastical History of the English People with Bede's Letter to Egbert and Cuthbert's Letter on the Death of Bede|pages=324|year= 1990|publisher= Penguin Books|isbn=0-14-0444565-X}}</ref>

An important charter of 736, the [[Ismere Diploma]], which survives in a contemporary (and possibly original) copy, starts by describing Ethelbald as "king not only of the Mercians but also of all the provinces which are called by the general name South English"; in the witness list he is further named "Rex Britanniae", "King of Britain".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=get&type=charter&id=89 | title = Anglo-Saxons.net: S 89 | accessmonthday=27 April | accessyear = 2007}}</ref><ref name=Fletcher_98>{{cite book |last= Fletcher|first= Richard|title= Who's Who in Roman Britain and Anglo-Saxon England|pages=98-100|year= 1989|publisher= Shepheard-Walwyn|isbn=0-85683-089-5}}</ref> It may be that at that time these titles would not have been acknowledged much beyond [[Worcester]], where this and other documents from the 730s that use similar titles were written.<ref name=Kirby_130>{{cite book |last= Kirby|first= D.P.|title= The Earliest English Kings|pages=130|year= 1991|publisher= Unwin Hyman|isbn=0-04-445692-1}}</ref> It is notable that Ethelbald's dominance did not earn him the title of "[[bretwalda]]" ("Wide-Ruler", or "Ruler of Britain") from the anonymous annalist of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, who listed eight kings as bearing this title,<ref name=Swanton_60>The different versions of the title, "bretwalda" and "brytenwalda", are in the A and E texts of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, in the entry for 827.  {{cite book |last= Swanton|first= Michael|title= The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle|pages=60-61|year= 1996|publisher= Routledge|isbn=0-415-92129-5}}</ref> though it has been conjectured that this is an error on the annalist's part.<ref name=BlairAITASE_201>{{cite book |last= Blair|first= Peter Hunter|title= An Introduction to Anglo-Saxon England|pages=201|year= 1960|publisher= Cambridge University Press}}</ref>

There is evidence that Ethelbald had to go to war to maintain his dominance.  In 733 Ethelbald undertook an expedition against Wessex and captured the royal [[manorialism|manor]] of [[Somerton]]. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle also tells how when [[Cuthred of Wessex|Cuthred]] succeeded Aethelheard to the throne of Wessex, in 740, he "boldly made war against Aethelbald, king of Mercia".<ref name=Swanton_44>{{cite book |last= Swanton|first= Michael|title= The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle|pages=44-45|year= 1996|publisher= Routledge|isbn=0-415-92129-5}}</ref>  Three years later, Cuthred and Aethelbald are described as fighting against the Welsh.  This could have been an obligation placed on Cuthred by Mercia; earlier kings had similarly assisted [[Penda of Mercia|Penda]] and [[Wulfhere of Mercia|Wulfhere]].<ref name=Kirby_130>{{cite book |last= Kirby|first= D.P.|title= The Earliest English Kings|pages=130|year= 1991|publisher= Unwin Hyman|isbn=0-04-445692-1}}</ref>  In 752 they are again on opposite sides of the conflict, and according to one version of the manuscript, Cuthred "put him [Ethelbald] to flight."<ref name=Swanton_46_2>{{cite book |last= Swanton|first= Michael|title= The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle|pages=46-47|year= 1996|publisher= Routledge|isbn=0-415-92129-5}}</ref> Ethelbald seems to have reasserted his authority over the West Saxons by the time of his death, since a later West Saxon king, [[Cynewulf of Wessex|Cynewulf]], is recorded as witnessing a charter of Ethelbald at the very beginning of his reign, in 757.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+96 | title = Anglo-Saxons.net: S 96 | accessmonthday=28 April | accessyear = 2007}}</ref>

In 740, a war between the Picts and the Northumbrians is reported.  Ethelbald, who may have been allied with [[Óengus I of the Picts|Óengus]],<ref name=Campbell_95 /> the king of the Picts, took advantage of [[Eadberht of Northumbria|Eadberht]]'s absence from Northumbria to ravage his lands, and perhaps burn [[York]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Anderson|first= Alan Orr|title= Scottish Annals from English Chroniclers A.D. 500–1286|pages=55-56|year= 1908|publisher= D. Nutt}}</ref>

==Relations with the church==
In 745-746 [[Saint Boniface|St Boniface]], along with seven other bishops, sent Ethelbald a reproachful letter.  In it, they accused Ethelbald of many sins -- fornication with nuns, stealing ecclesiastical revenue, violating church privileges, and requiring forced labour from the clergy.  Boniface also praises Ethelbald's faith, and alms-giving, but the criticisms have strongly coloured subsequent opinion of Ethelbald.<ref name=Fletcher_98 />  Two years later, perhaps in response to this letter, Ethelbald attended, and perhaps presided over, the council of Clovesho, which was concerned with the relationship between the church and the secular world.<ref name=FC>Richard Fletcher says that Archbishop Cuthbert of Canterbury presided, though he adds that the council could not have been convened without royal sanction; James Campbell says that Aethelbald presided.  {{cite book |last= Fletcher|first= Richard|title= Who's Who in Roman Britain and Anglo-Saxon England|pages=100|year= 1989|publisher= Shepheard-Walwyn|isbn=0-85683-089-5}}  Also {{cite book |last= Campbell|first= John|coauthors= John, Eric & Wormald, Patrick|title= The Anglo-Saxons|pages=78|year= 1991|publisher= Penguin Books|isbn=0-14-014395-5}}</ref>  The council limited relations between monks and laymen, and generally ruled that secular activities were impermissible for monks -- secular songs and secular business were both forbidden, in addition to "ludicrous songs".  The council also objected to secular suspicion of the clergy.  Two years after this, at Gumley, in 749, Ethelbald issued a charter that freed [[ecclesiastical]] lands from all obligations except the requirement to build forts and bridges -- obligations which lay upon everyone, as part of the [[trinoda necessitas]].  This charter was witnessed only by Mercian bishops, and it is possible it had no effect outside Mercia, but it is also possible that it was essentially part of a reform programme inspired by Boniface and instigated at Clovesho.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=get&type=charter&id=92 | title = Anglo-Saxons.net: S 92 | accessmonthday=28 April | accessyear = 2007}}</ref><ref name=Campbell_100>{{cite book |last= Campbell|first= John|coauthors= John, Eric & Wormald, Patrick|title= The Anglo-Saxons|pages=100|year= 1991|publisher= Penguin Books|isbn=0-14-014395-5}}</ref>

==Death==
In [[757]], he was killed at [[Seckington]], [[Warwickshire]], near the royal seat of [[Tamworth]].  According to a later continuation of [[Bede]]'s, he was "treacherously murdered at night by his own bodyguards", but the reason why is unrecorded.  He was succeeded, briefly, by [[Beornrad of Mercia|Beornrad]]. Ethelbald was buried at [[Repton]], in a crypt which still can be seen.  The monastery church on the site at that time was probably constructed by Ethelbald to house the royal mausoleum; other burials there include that of [[Wigstan]].<ref name=Swanton_48>{{cite book |last= Swanton|first= Michael|title= The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle|pages=48-49|year= 1996|publisher= Routledge|isbn=0-415-92129-5}}</ref><ref name=Fletcher_98 /><ref name=Fletcher_116>{{cite book |last= Fletcher|first= Richard|title= Who's Who in Roman Britain and Anglo-Saxon England|pages=116|year= 1989|publisher= Shepheard-Walwyn|isbn=0-85683-089-5}}</ref>
