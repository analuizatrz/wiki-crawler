The article informs about the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Army Group South]] '''Sea of Azov Offensive Operation''' (begun on the 12 September 1941)<ref name="p.87, Haupt, Army Group South">p.87, Haupt, Army Group South</ref> commanded by General [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Rostov Defensive Operation]] (5 November 1941 - 16 November 1941) by the [[Southern Front]] commanded by General-Colonel [[Yakov Cherevichenko]], and the [[Rostov Offensive Operation]] (27 November 1941 - 2 December 1941) executed by the same Soviet Front. 

These operations were a part of the southern sector of the [[Eastern Front (WWII)|Eastern Front]] during the [[Second World War]], fought around the city of [[Rostov-on-Don]].

=== Prelude ===
After concluding the [[Battle of Kiev (1941)|Battle of Kiev]] in September 1941, the German Army Group South advanced from the [[Dniepr River|Dniepr]] to the [[Sea of Azov]] coast. [[Walther von Reichenau]]'s [[6th Army (Germany)|6th Army]] [[First Battle of Kharkov|captured Kharkov]]. [[Carl-Heinrich von Stülpnagel]]'s [[17th Army (Germany)|17th Army]] marched through [[Poltava]] towards [[Voroshilovgrad]]. [[Erich von Manstein]]'s [[11th Army (Germany)|11th Army]] moved into the [[Crimea]] and had taken control of all of the peninsula by autumn (except [[Sevastopol]], which held out until [[3 July]] [[1942]]).

[[Ewald von Kleist]]'s 1st Panzer Army advanced from Kiev, and encircled Soviet troops at [[Melitopol]] in October, then attacked east along the shore of the Sea of Azov toward [[Rostov-on-Don|Rostov]] at the mouth of the [[Don River, Russia|Don river]], known as the gateway to the [[Caucasus]].

=== Sea of Azov offensive Operation ===
Rostov was assigned as the objective to the [[11th Army (Germany)|11th Army]] now commanded by General [[Eugen Ritter von Schobert|von Schobert]], however he died in a crash on the same day after landing his liaison [[Fieseler Fi 156|Fieseler Storch]] aircraft in a minefield.<ref name="p.87, Haupt, Army Group South"/> To replace him, General of Infantry [[Erich von Manstein|von Manstein]] was ordered to travel from the Leningrad sector of the front to the extreme southern sector. He would also receive support from the [[Luftflotte 4|4th Luftwaffe Air Fleet]].

At this time the [[LIV Army Corps (Germany)|LIVth Army Corps]] of the 11th Army was still engaged in [[Crimea]], and because the Romanian Armies were still engaged in the [[Siege of Odessa (1941)|Siege of Odessa]], the Army's resources for the Rostov objective were severely limited even against retreating Red Army troops. Therefore in the first instance von Manstein replaced the LIV Corps with the smaller [[XXX Army Corps (Germany)|XXXth Army Corps]] and [[XLIX Mountain Corps (Germany)|XLIXth Mountain Corps]], and ordered the LIV Corps into the first echelon in the advance to Rostov.

Late in September the [[Romanian 3rd Army|3rd Romanian Army]] joined the 11th Army in its advance towards Rostov, but was severely depleted by the attacks of the Soviet [[9th Army (Soviet Union)|9th]] and [[18th Army (Soviet Union)|18th Armies]] on the 26th of September. This forced a halt to the Army's advance to safeguard its flank, and forced von Manstein to use his only mobile reserve unit, the [[Leibstandarte#Brigade_status.E2.80.94Balkans|Leibstandarte Brigade]] to shore up Romanian defenses.<ref name="p.91, Haupt, Army Group South">p.91, Haupt, Army Group South</ref>

=== Rostov Defensive Operation ===
The Soviet counter-attack delivered as part of the general [[Donbass-Rostov Strategic Defensive Operation]] (29 September 1941 - 16 November 1941) also forced the Army Group Commander to order his [[1st Panzer Army (Germany)|1st Panzer Army]] to manoeuvre in order to be better placed to counter any further Soviet thrusts in the Romanian sector of the front, and also to attempt an encirclement of the two Soviet Armies, which was partly successful in the area of [[Chernigovka]] wher the commander of the 18th Soviet Army General-Lieutenant Smirnov was killed during the breakout attempt<ref name="p.91, Haupt, Army Group South"/> between 5 and 10 October 1941. This was interpreted by Hitler as such a success that he declared "The battle of the Sea of Azov is over." on the 11 October before the troops had even reached their objective.<ref>p.92, Haupt, Army Group South</ref> As a commemorative gesture, Hitler issued the order to redesignate the Leibstandarte Brigade as [[1st SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler]]. 

The German 11th Army was ordered back to Crimea to effect the [[Battle of Crimea (1941)|breakthrough]] of the [[Isthmus of Perekop]].

Perceiving that the way to Rostov, and the Caucasus was open, Hitler issued a spurious order transferring the objective from the 11th Army to the 1st Panzer Army, and attaching to it ill prepared [[Romania_during_World_War_II#The_war_on_the_Eastern_Front|Romanian 3rd Army]], the [[Italian_war_in_Soviet_Union%2C_1941-1943#August_1941-_July_1942.2C_CSIR_Operations|Italian Alpine Corps]], and the [[Slovak_Republic_%281939%E2%80%931945%29#Brigade_Pilfousek|Slovakian Motorised Brigade]].

During the subsequent reorganisation of Axis forces the [[III Panzer Corps (Germany)|IIIrd Panzer Corps]] and [[XIV Panzer Corps (Germany)|XIVth Panzer Corps]] took the lead, supported by the XLIX Mountain Corps recently arrived from Crimea.

By the 17th October 1941 the [[Mius River|Mius river]] was crossed by the [[14th Panzer Division (Germany)|14th Panzer Division]], and [[Taganrog]] was captured by German troops, with the mountain troops entering [[Stalino]], forcing the newly formed [[12th Army (Soviet Union)|12th Army]] into a renewed withdrawal. However the Red Army was at this stage fortunate in that the Autumn rains had begun, and the infamous [[Rasputitsa]] had set in slowing the 1st Panzer Army's advance to "meter by meter".<ref>p.95, Haupt, Army Group South</ref>  This meant that the leading German units did not reach the outskirts of Rostov until mid-November, having lost contact with the Red Army in the meantime.<ref>p.101, Haupt, Army Group South</ref>

The assault on Rostov began on the 17 November, and on [[21 November]] the Germans took Rostov. However, the German lines were over-extended, and von Kleist's warnings that his left flank was vulnerable and that his tanks were ineffective in the freezing weather were ignored.

=== Rostov Offensive Operation ===

On [[27 November]] the [[Soviet 37th Army]], commanded by Lieutenant-General [[Anton Ivanovich Lopatin]], as part of the [[Rostov Strategic Offensive Operation]] (17 November 1941 - 2 December 1941), counter-attacked the 1st Panzer Army's spearhead from the north, forcing them to pull out of the city. [[Adolf Hitler]] countermanded the retreat. When von Rundstedt refused to obey, Hitler sacked him. However, retreat was unavoidable, and the 1st Panzer Army was forced back to the [[Mius River]] at [[Taganrog]]. It was the first significant German withdrawal of the war.

=== Consequences ===

The need to take, and surrender Rostov forced the [[OKH]] through Hitler's insistence to focus on the  Army Group South's progress, and set the stage for the subsequent [[Battle of Stalingrad]].

=== The Battles for Rostov in fiction ===

[[Stuart M. Kaminsky]]'s character [[Porfiry Petrovich Rostnikov]] fought in the at Rostov as a young man.  He took out a German tank with a [[grenade]] and a lucky burst of gunfire from a looted German [[machine pistol]], but was badly wounded.  A doctor saved his leg, but the leg was badly injured enough to give Rostnikov his trademark limp.
