Saint '''Gregory of Nazianzus''' ([[329]] - [[January 25]], [[389]]), also known as Saint '''Gregory the Theologian''' or '''Gregory Nazianzen''', was a [[4th century]] [[Christianity|Christian]] [[bishop]] of [[List of Constantinople patriarchs|Constantinople]]. Gregory is widely considered the most accomplished rhetorical stylist of the patristic age.<ref>McGuckin, John. ''Saint Gregory of Nazianzus: An Intellectual Biography'' (Crestwood, NY: 2001), p. xxi.</ref> As a classicaly trained speaker and philosopher he infused Hellenism into to early church, establishing the paradigm of the Byzantine church.<ref>McGuckin (2001), p. xxiv.</ref> He is remembered as the "Trinitarian Theologian," since many of his homilies refer to the nature of the [[Holy Trinity]] and the one essence of the [[Godhead]].

Gregory is honored as a [[saint]] by the [[Catholicism|Roman Catholic Church]] and as a [[Doctor of the Church]].  In [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] and the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] he is one of the [[Three Holy Hierarchs]], along with [[Basil of Caesarea]] and [[John Chrysostom]]. 

==Biography==
===Early Life and Education===
Gregory was born in Arianzus, near Nazianzus, in southwest Cappadocia. <ref>Ruether, Rosemary Radford. ''Gregory of Nazianzus: Rhetor and Philospoher'', (Oxford University Press, 1969), p. 18.</ref> His parents, [[Gregory of Nazianzus the Elder|Gregory]] and Nonna, were wealthy land-owners. In 325 Nonna converted her husband to Christianity; he was subsequently consecrated bishop of Nazianzus in 328 or 329.<ref>McGuckin (2001), p. vii</ref>  The young Gregory and his brother, Caesarius, first studied at home with his uncle Amphylokhios. Later he studied advanced rhetoric and philosophy in [[Nazianzus]], [[Caesarea Mazaca|Caesarea]] [[Cappadocia]], [[Alexandria]] and [[Athens]]. While at Athens, he developed a close friendship with felow student Saint [[Basil of Caesarea]] and also made the acquaintance of Julian, the later emperor who would become known as [[Julian the Apostate]].<ref>Ruether (1969), pp. 19, 25.</ref> In Athens Gregory studied under the famous  rhetoricians [[Himerius]] and [[Proaeresius]].<ref>Hunter-Blair, D.O. ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'', article on Gregory of Nazianzus (Robert Appleton Co, 1910), retrieved online April 2007</ref> Upon finishing his education, he also taught rhetoric in Athens for a short time.

===Priesthood===
In [[361]], Gregory returned to Nazianzus and was ordained a presbyter by his father, who wanted him to assist with caring for local Christians.<ref>McGuckin (2001), pp. 99-102.</ref> The younger Gregory, who had been considering a monastic existence, left home after a few days to meet his friend Basil at Annesoi, where the two lived as ascetics.<ref>McGuckin (2001), p. 102.</ref> However, Basil urged him to return home to assist his father, which he did for the next year. Arriving at Nazianzus, Gregory found the local Christian community split by theological differences and his father accused of heresy by local monks.<ref>McGuckin (2001), p. 107.</ref> Gregory helped to heal the division through a combination of personal diplomacy and oratory. 

Emperor Julian had publically come out as opposed to Christianity by this time.<ref>McGuckin (2001), p. 115.</ref> In response to the emperor's denial of the Christian faith, Gregory composed his ''Invectives Against Julian'' between 362 and 363. Disparaging the emperor's morals and intellect, the ''Invectives'' assert that Christianity will overcome imperfect rulers such as Julian through love and patience. This process as described by Gregory is the public manifestation of the process of deification (''[[theosis]]''), which leads to a spiritual elevation and mystical union with God. <ref>McGuckin (2001), p. 121.</ref> Julian resolved in late 362 to vigorously prosecute Gregory and his other Christian critics; however, the emperor perished the following year during a campaign against the Persians. <ref>McGuckin (2001), pp. 125-126.</ref> With the death of the emperor, Gregory and the Eastern churches were no longer under the threat of persecution, as the new emperor [[Jovian]] was an avowed Christian and supporter of the church.<ref>McGuckin (2001), p. 130.</ref>

Gregory spent the next few years combating the [[Arianism|Arian heresy]], which threatened to divide the region of Cappadocia. In this tense environment Gregory inteceded on behalf of his friend Basil with Bishop [[Eusebios]] of Caesarea.<ref>McGuckin (2001), p. 138-142.</ref> The two friends then entered a period of close fraternal cooperation as they participated in a great rhetorical contest of the Caesarean Church precipitated by the arrival of accomplished Arian theologians and rhetors.<ref>McGuckin (2001), p. 143.</ref> In the subsequent public debates, presided over by agents of the emperor [[Valens]], Gregory and Basil emerged triumphant. This success confirmed for both Gregory and Basil that their futures lay in administration of the church.<ref>McGuckin (2001), p. 143.</ref> Basil, who had long displayed episcopal inclinations, was elected bishop of the see of Caesarea in 370.

===Episcopate in Sasima and Nazianzus===
Gregory was consecrated Bishop of [[Sasima]] in 372 by Basil.<ref>McGuckin (2001), pp. 190-195.</ref> This was a see newly created by Basil in order to strengthen his position in his dispute with [[Anthimus]], bishop of Tyana.<ref>Hunter-Blair, 1910</ref> The ambitions of Gregory's father to have his son rise in the church hierarchy and the insistence of his friend Basil convinced Gregory to accept this position despite his reservations. Gregory would later refer to his episcopal ordination as forced upon him by his strong-willed father and Basil.<ref>McGuckin (2001), pp.187-192.</ref> Describing his new bishopric, Gregory lamented how it was nothing more than an "utterly dreadful, pokey little hole; a paltry horse-stop on the main road...devoid of water, vegetation, or the company of gentlemen...this was my Church of Sasima!"<ref>Gregory, as quoted in Migne, J.P. (ed), ''Patrologiae Graecae'', (1857-1866), ''De Vita Sua'', vv. 439-446,  37.1059-1060.</ref>  

By late 372 Gregory returned to Nazianzus to assist his dying father with the administration of his diocese.<ref>McGuckin (2001), p. 199.</ref> This strained his relations with Basil, who insisted that Gregory assume his post at Sasima. Gregory retorted that he had no intention to continue to play the role of pawn to advance Basil's interests. <ref>Gallay, P. ''Grigoie de Nazianze''. Paris: 1964, p.61. Quoting from Ep. 48, PG 37.97</ref> He instead focused his attention on his new duties as [[co-adjutor]] of Nazianzus. It was here that Gregory preached the first of his great episcopal orations.

Following the deaths of his mother and father in 374, Gregory continued to administer the diocese of Nazianzus but refused to be named bishop. Donating most of his inheritence to the needy, he lived an austere existence.<ref>Hunter-Blair, D.O. (1910)</ref> At the end of 375 he withdrew to a monastary at Seleukia, living there for three years. Near the end of this period his friend Basil died. Although Gregory's health did not permit him to attend the funeral, he wrote a heartfelt letter of condolence to Basil's brother, [[Gregory of Nyssa]] and composed twelve memorial poems dedicated to the memory of his departed friend.

===Gregory at Constantinople===

The death of Emperor Valens in 378 and subsequent ascention of Emperor Theodosius, a steadfast supporter of Nicene orthodoxy, brought good news to those who wished to purge Constantinople of [[Arian]] and [[Apollinarianism]] domination.<ref>McGuckin (2001), p. 235.</ref>  Slowly the exiled Nicene party returned to the city. From his deathbed, Basil reminded them of Gregory's capabilities and likely recommended his friend to champion the trinitarian cause in Constantinople.<ref>McGuckin (2001), pp. 235-236. See also Orat. 43.2, PG 36.497.</ref> 

In [[379]], the Antioch synod and its archbishop, Meletios, asked Gregory to go to Constantinople to lead a theological campaign to win over that city to Nicene orthodoxy. After much hesitation, Gregory agreed. His cousin Theodosia offered him a villa for his residence; Gregory immediately transformed much of it into a church, naming it Anastasia, "a scene for the resurection of the faith."<ref>McGuckin (2001), pp. 241. See also 2 Kings 4:8 and Orat. 26.17, PG 35.1249.</ref> From this little chapel he delivered five powerful discourses on Nicene doctrine, explaining the nature of the Trinity and the unity of the Godhead. <ref>Hunter-Blair, D.O. ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'', article on Gregory of Nazianzus.</ref> Refuting the Eunomion denial of the Holy Spirit's divinity, Gregory offers sublime arguments:

{{cquote|Look at these facts: Christ is born, the Holy Spirit is His Forerunner. Christ is baptized, the Spirit bears witness to this… Christ works miracles, the Spirit accompanies them. Christ ascends, the Spirit takes His place. What great things are there in the idea of God which are not in His power? What titles appertaining to God do not apply also to Him, except for Unbegotten and Begotten? I tremble when I think of such an abundance of titles, and how many Names they blaspheme, those who revolt against the Spirit!  <ref>Gregory of Nazianzus, Or. 31:29</ref>}}

Gregory's homelies were well-received and attracted ever-growing crowds to Anastasia. Fearing his popularity, his opponents decided to strike. On the vigil of Easter in 379, an Arian mob burst into his church during worship services, wounding Gregory and killing another bishop. Escaping the mob and rallying the faithful, Gregory was subsequently elected archbishop of Constantinople in 380, replacing Demophilos. He maintained an ascetic existence in the capital as though he still lived in the wilderness: "his food was food of the wilderness; his clothing was whatever necessary. He made visitations without pretense, and though in proximity of the court, he sought nothing from the court." 

However, Gregory found his episcopal title challenged by an erstwhile follower. One whom he considered as his friend, the philosopher Maximus, was consecrated at Constantinople in Gregory's place. Struck by the ingratitude of Maximus, Gregory decided to resign the cathedra, but his faithful flock restrained him from it. The Nicene faction united to throw Maximus out of the city. On November 24, 380 the emperor [[Theodosius]] arrived in the capital and, in enforcing his decree against the heretic, the main church was returned to the Orthodox, with St Gregory making a solemn entrance.

===Second Ecumenical Council and Retirement to Arianzum===
At the [[Second Ecumenical Council]] in 381, Gregory was elected patriarch of Constantinople. After the death of Patriarch [[Meletius of Antioch]], Gregory presided at the Council. Hoping to reconcile the West with the East, he offered to recognize [[Paulinus]] as Patriarch of Antioch. Those who had acted against Gregory on behalf of Maximus, particularly Egyptian and Macedonian bishops, arrived late for the Council. Once there, they refused to acknowledge Gregory as a patriarch since he was elected in their absence. 

Gregory decided to resign his office for the sake of peace in the Church: "Let me be as the Prophet Jonah! I was responsible for the storm, but I would sacrifice myself for the salvation of the ship. Seize me and throw me... I was not happy when I ascended the throne, and gladly would I descend it." After telling the emperor of his desire to quit the capital, Gregory appeared again at the Council to deliver a farewell address (Or. 42) asking to be allowed to depart in peace. 

Upon his return to his native region, Gregory turned his attention to the incursion of Appolinarian heretics into the flock of Nazianzus. Gregory established Eulalius as bishop of Nazianzus and then withdrew into the solitude of Arianzum. He died there on January 25, 389.

===Theology and other works===
Gregory's most significant theological contributions arose from his defense of the Nicene doctrine of the [[Trinity]]. He is especially noted for his contributions to the field of [[pneumatology]] - that is, theology concerning the nature of the [[Holy Spirit]].<ref>For example, see Michael O'Carroll, "Gregory of Nazianzus" in ''Trinitas'' (Wilmington, DE: Michael Glazier, Inc, 1987).</ref> In this regard, Gregory is the first to use the idea of ''procession'' to describe the relationship between the Spirit and the Godhead: "The Holy Spirit is truly Spirit, coming forth from the Father indeed but not after the manner of the Son, for it is not by generation but by ''procession'', since I must coin a word for the sake of clearness."<ref>Gregory of Nazianzus, ''Five Theological Orations'', oration five.  This fifth oration deals entirely with the Holy Spirit.</ref> Although Gregory does not fully develop the concept, the idea of procession would shape most later thought about the Holy Spirit.<ref>See H.E.W. Turner and Francis Young, "Procession(s)" in ''The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology'', ed. A. Richardson & J. Bowden (Philadelphia:Westminster Press, 1983). Through Augustine, the idea would develop in the West into "double-procession," resulting in the ''[[Filioque clause]]'' and the split between Eastern and Western Christianity.</ref>

He emphasized that Jesus did not cease to be God when he became a man, nor did he lose any of his divine attributes when he took on human nature. Furthermore, Gregory asserted that Christ was fully human, including a full human soul.  He also proclaimed the eternality of the Holy Spirit, saying that the Holy Spirit's actions were somewhat hidden in the [[Old Testament]] but much clearer since the ascension of Jesus into Heaven and the descent of the Holy Spirit at the feast of Pentecost. Gregory of Nazianzus is given the title ''Theologus'', or Theologian, by Eastern Orthodoxy, a title held by no others save [[John the Apostle]]. <ref>Hunter-Blair, D.O. ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'', article on Gregory of Nazianzus</ref>  He is widely quoted by Eastern Orthodox theologians and highly regarded as a defender of the Christian faith.

Apart from the several theological discourses, Gregory is also one of the most important early Christian man of letters, a very accomplished orator, perhaps one of the greatest of his time, and also a very prolific poet, having written several poems with theological and moral matter and some with biographical content, about himself and about his friends.

===Relics===
Following his death, Saint Gregory's body was buried at Nazianzus. His relics were transferred to [[Constantinople]] in 950, into the church of the Holy Apostles. Part of the relics were taken from Constantinople by [[Crusade]]rs during the [[Fourth Crusade]] in [[1204]] and ended up in [[Rome]]. On [[27 November]] [[2004]], those relics were returned (along with the relics of [[John Chrysostom]]) to [[Istanbul]] by [[Pope John Paul II]] (though the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] retained a small portion of the relics). The relics are now enshrined in the [[Orthodox Church of Constantinople|Patriarchal]] Cathedral of St. George in the [[Fanar]].<ref>Ian Fisher, "Pope returns remains of 2 Orthodox patriarchs," ''San Diego Union-Tribune [http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20041128/news_1n28pope.html online],'' November 28, 2004.
