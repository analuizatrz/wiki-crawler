==Plot==
''Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance'' is set on a fictional continent called Tellius.

These events mark the beginning of a long journey that will take Ike, Elincia, and the mercenaries across the continent and back in an effort to defeat Daein and restore Crimea's royalty to the throne.

Over the course of the game, Ike and his companions must overcome long-held racial tensions between the beorc and laguz in order to form an alliance against their true enemy, [[List of characters in Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance#Ashnard|Ashnard]], king of Daein. In particular, Ike manages to reestablish relations between the beorc nation of Begnion and the few remaining members of the heron laguz clan, which was annihilated in an act of [[genocide]] known as the Serenes Massacre. With this accomplishment, Ike is given command of a patchwork army that he leads into Daein and finally back to Crimea, where he confronts the Black Knight and ultimately King Ashnard himself.<ref name="''Long live King Ashnard''">{{cite news|title='Final Boss &mdash; Ashnard'|url=http://www.n-philes.com/features.php?id=294|accessdate=2007-08-03|author=|date|work=[http://www.n-philes.com/ N-Philes]}}</ref>

==Setting==
[[Image:Tellius map.jpg|thumb|190px|A map of Tellius. The highlighted nations are Gallia (green), Crimea (gold), and Daein (red).]]
''Path of Radiance'' is set on the fictional continent of Tellius. Tellius is divided into nations that are either governed by beorc or laguz. There are seven nations:<ref name="''Tellius''">{{cite news|title='Nations'|url=http://www.acornrack.com/SoT/Nations.php|accessdate=2007-08-31|author=|date|work=[http://www.acornrack.com/SoT/index.php?mainShadows of Tellius]}}</ref>

'''Crimea:''' A kingdom that is home to the Mercenaries. At the start of the game, it is invaded by Daein.<br>
'''Daein:''' A beorc kingdom that had become antagonistic ever since King Ashnard ascended the throne.<br>
'''Begnion:''' A beorc theocracy towards the goddess Ashera. The figurehead is [[List of characters in Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance#Begnion senate|Apostle Sanaki]].<br>
'''Gallia:''' Home to the beast laguz; it had recently improved relations with the beorc country, Crimea. Ruled by [[List of characters in Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance#Laguz|King Caneghis]]<br>
'''Phoenicis:''' Home to the hawk laguz; its leader is [[List of characters in Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance# Bird Tribe|Tibarn]].<br>
'''Kilvas:''' Home to the raven laguz, they are considered more cunning and dishonorable than the hawks. Their king is [[List of characters in Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance#Bird Tribe|Naesala]]<br>
'''Goldoa:''' Home of the dragons; it isolates itself from the rest of Tellius. Ruled by the legendary [[List of characters in Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance#Laguz|Black Dragon King]].

==The Fire Emblem==
In the fictional world of Tellius, the Fire Emblem takes the form of a simple bronze medallion also known as Lehran's Medallion. It holds the soul of an evil god whose energies disrupt the level of chaotic energy in a person. For example, when Greil touched the medallion, it caused him to go berserk and kill everyone in sight, including his wife, Elena. It was only when she took the medallion from his hand in her final moments that Greil regained his sanity. Only a person with a high level of balance is capable of holding the medallion without losing his or her mind.<ref name="''The Fire Emblem in PoR''">{{cite news|title='The Fire Emblem'|http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/elaice/general/emblem.html|accessdate=2007-08-03|author=|date|work=[http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/elaice/general/ Serenes Forest]}}</ref> Ike's mother, Elena, and his younger sister, Mist, are two such people.

The medallion once belonged to the Heron clans that dwelt in the Serenes Forest within Begnion. They were charged with protecting the medallion so that the evil god would not be released. However, the Serenes Massacre forced Lillia, a member of the Heron royal family, to flee with the medallion, only to be captured by Ashnard (or his subordinates). Lillia was ordered to free the dark god, but she instead befriended Elena and gave the medallion to her. Mist eventually inherited it from her mother.

In the final chapter of the "Difficult" difficulty (and "Maniac" in the Japanese version), Ashnard uses the medallion after his initial defeat to gain godlike power. Despite this strength growth, he is still defeated by Ike and the party.

==Gameplay mechanics==
The game retains the fundamental [[Fire Emblem#Gameplay|gameplay mechanics]] of the ''Fire Emblem'' series, such as the weapon triangle and grid-based battlefields. However, there are some changes to the gameplay, such as the way in which the group prepares and units support each other, as well as a change to the magic system. 

===New race===
''Path of Radiance'' introduces the laguz changelings&mdash;humanoid creatures that can transform into powerful animals. They can either be in their humanoid form or their animal form; this depends on whether their transformation gauge is full.<ref name="''Nintendo World Repott review''">{{cite news|title='Nintendo World Review &mdash; Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance'|url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/reviewArt.cfm?artid=4397&CFID=31031509&CFTOKEN=509fe6c5199190d5-2B6D96CF-C09F-3E62-05A7BF71C07F788E|accessdate=2007-08-03|author=Zosha Arusan|date=2005-08-28|work=[http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/ NintendoWorldReport]}}</ref> The bar within the transformation gauge increases each turn; the laguz spend roughly an equal level of time in each form. The humanoid form can be completely bypassed if the laguz is equipped with either a demi band or a laguz band&mdash;the former of which decreases the user's battle statistics.<ref name="''Demi and Laguz band''">{{cite news|title='Laguz and Demi bands'|url=http://fep.gtsplus.net/?fep=games/9/items&key=Equipment|accessdate=2007-08-05|author=|date=|work=[http://fep.gtsplus.net/ FEPlanet]}}</ref> When in animal form, laguz use the natural weapons of their species&mdash;claws for beasts, beaks for birds, and breath attacks for dragons. The natural weapons of a laguz will never break with use (unlike normal beorc weaponry). There are three species of laguz&mdash;beasts, birds, and dragons.<ref name="''The laguz forms''">{{cite news|title='Ninty &mdash; Fire Emblem: PoR review'|url=http://www.ninty.net/reviews.php?do=view&id=26|accessdate=2007-08-05|author=William Jepson|date=2005-12-05|work=[http://www.ninty.net/index.php Ninty]}}</ref> These species are further divided into three classes each, although not all of them are playable. Beast laguz (of Gallia) are divided into cats, tigers, and lions; birds into ravens (of Kilvas), hawks (of Phoenicis), and herons (of Serenes); and dragons (of Goldoa) are divided into red, white, and black dragons. Unlike beorcs&mdash;the name for normal humans&mdash;laguz do not use manmade weapons and are thus unable to attack when not in animal form.<ref name="''Laguz weapons''">{{cite news|title='Laguz weapons'|url=http://fep.gtsplus.net/?fep=games/9/items&key=Laguz|accessdate=2007-08-05|author=|date=|work=[http://fep.gtsplus.net/ FEPlanet]}}</ref>  Each laguz species has an elemental weakness&mdash;fire for beasts, wind for birds, and thunder for dragons. Birds can fly in either form, but also have the weakness to bows associated with flying units.

===Unit classes===
This installment of the ''Fire Emblem'' series&mdash;like the previous two released in the West&mdash;allows the player to change a unit's class once he or she reaches a certain level. However, unlike in the [[Game Boy Advance]] games (which used specially designated items for promotion) a unit automatically promotes upon reaching level twenty-one. Players can also use the Master Seal item to immediately promote any unit at any point between levels ten to twenty.<ref name="''Graphics and Voice Acting''">{{cite news|title='RPG fan reviews &mdash; Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance'|url=http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/fireemblem-por/index.html|accessdate=2007-08-03|author=Mark P. Tjan|date=2006-02-01|work=[http://www.rpgfan.com/index.html RPG Fan]}}</ref> The laguz can not promote.

''Path of Radiance'' introduces some new classes while omitting some that were present in earlier ''Fire Emblem'' installments.<ref name="''Nintendo World Repott review''">{{cite news|title='Nintendo World Review &mdash; Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance'|url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/reviewArt.cfm?artid=4397&CFID=31031509&CFTOKEN=509fe6c5199190d5-2B6D96CF-C09F-3E62-05A7BF71C07F788E|accessdate=2007-08-03|author=Zosha Arusan|date=2005-08-28|work=[http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/ NintendoWorldReport]}}</ref> There has also been some changes to which weapons some classes can wield.

===Battle preparation===
''Path of Radiance'' is the first ''Fire Emblem'' game to feature a "Base screen" along with the "Battle Preparations" screen.<ref name="''CCGR &mdash; Path of Radiance review''">{{cite news|title='CCGR &mdash; Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance'|url=http://www.ccgr.org/modules.php?name=MReviews&op=show&rid=671|accessdate=2007-08-05|author=Joshua Johnston|date=2006-02-19|work=[http://www.ccgr.org/index.php CCGR]}}</ref> Before the Base screen appears, [[List of characters in Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance#Soren|Soren]] provides information on the previous battle, including the weapons and the distribution of bonus experience and skills. Furthermore, players can engage in [[Fire Emblem#Relationships|support conversations]] and the new "Info" conversations, chapter-specific conversations rated on a scale of one to three stars. One star denotes conversations that provide story background; two stars mark conversations that provide hints on how to proceed in the coming battle, and three stars indicate that the conversation may yield a special ability or new playable character.

====Skill system====
The skill system, which was introduced in ''[[Fire Emblem: Seisen no Keifu]]'',<ref name="''Introduction of the skill system''">{{cite news|title='Fire Emblem: Seisen no Keifu &mdash; skills'|url=http://hg101.classicgaming.gamespy.com/fireemblem/fireemblem2.htm|accessdate=2007-08-05|date|work=[http://hg101.classicgaming.gamespy.com/index.html Hardcore Gaming 101 &mdash; Fire Emblem]}}</ref> has different mechanics in this game. Each character has a capacity gauge that allows for mastery of skills. By using a skill scroll, the character learns the corresponding skill and a certain amount of slots are taken up in the capacity gauge, usually determined by how useful the skill is. The space of the capacity gauge varies between classes and characters.<ref name="''Nintendo World Repott review''">{{cite news|title='Nintendo World Review &mdash; Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance'|url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/reviewArt.cfm?artid=4397&CFID=31031509&CFTOKEN=509fe6c5199190d5-2B6D96CF-C09F-3E62-05A7BF71C07F788E|accessdate=2007-08-03|author=Zosha Arusan|date=2005-08-28|work=[http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/ NintendoWorldReport]}}</ref> Any unit can learn any skill, although there are exceptions. Skills vary in how useful they are and what they do. Most give the unit an advantage in battle; Ike's Aether, for example, allows him to deal extra damage while retrieving some health points in battle when it is triggered.
[[Image:Base FE.jpg|thumb|200px|Screenshot of the base screen, using the Bonus Experience to level up [[List of Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance characters#Nephenee|Nephenee]].]]

====Experience====
Bonus Experience was introduced in this game. At the end of every chapter, Bonus Experience is awarded based on certain factors such as number of enemies remaining and turns taken to complete the chapter. It can be distributed to units at the Base Screen.<ref name="''Graphics and Voice Acting''">{{cite news|title='RPG fan reviews &mdash; Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance'|url=http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/fireemblem-por/index.html|accessdate=2007-08-03|author=Mark P. Tjan|date=2006-02-01|work=[http://www.rpgfan.com/index.html RPG Fan]}}</ref> Experience is used just as in the previous ''Fire Emblem'' installments, with one-hundred points required to level up.

Another unique feature to ''Path of Radiance'' is Fixed mode, which is an alternative method for unit growth that is available after the first playthrough.<ref name="''Fixed mode''">{{cite news|title='Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance cheats and unlockables'|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Fire-Emblem-Path-of-Radiance-Cheats-and-Unlockables-GameCube-48777.shtml|accessdate=2007-08-05|author=|date=2006-02-01|work=[http://www.softpedia.com/ Softpedia]}}</ref> Random mode&mdash;the method used in all other titles in the series, as well as in the first playthrough of Path of Radiance&mdash;gives units a set percentage chance to increase a given stat upon level up. This chance is termed a "growth rate." Due to the "chance nature" of this system, a unit that levels up may gain many stat increases or none at all. In Fixed mode, units instead earn experience towards a stat increase as they earn standard experience. This "stat experience" is kept per stat, and if enough has been accumulated, that stat will increase the next time the unit gains a level and "stat experience" will return to zero; otherwise, it will carry over to the next level. Units earn stat experience based on their individual growth rates, which can be modified by what items a unit has equipped and the class of the enemy that it is attacking.

====Weapons====
The weapon forging system, introduced in this game, allows players to create improved versions of some of the weapons available in shops. Players can forge one weapon during every visit to the Base screen. To forge a weapon, the player first chooses a base weapon to modify. Choices of base weapon are initially limited, but more options become available as the player progresses through the game. The player can then increase or decrease several statistics of the weapon, such as strength and weight. The further away from the statistics of the base weapon, the higher the cost; making no changes to the base statistics results in the same price as the base weapon. After statistics are adjusted, the player can choose a new color for the weapon and give it a unique name.<ref name="''Nintendo World Repott review''">{{cite news|title='Nintendo World Review &mdash; Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance'|url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/reviewArt.cfm?artid=4397&CFID=31031509&CFTOKEN=509fe6c5199190d5-2B6D96CF-C09F-3E62-05A7BF71C07F788E|accessdate=2007-08-03|author=Zosha Arusan|date=2005-08-28|work=[http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/ NintendoWorldReport]}}</ref> These features have no effect on price.

====Support system====
The [[Fire Emblem#Supports|support system]], remains the same in how the support conversations affects each units and how the statistical boost is determined. However, instead of the support level being determined by the number of turns units are adjacent in a battle, it is now determined by the number of battles two units have been in together.<ref name="Production I'G">{{cite news|title='Gaming Evolution &mdash; Path of Radiance review'|url=http://www.gamingevolution.info/index.php?id=1463|accessdate=2007-08-05|date=|work=[http://www.gamingevolution.info/ GamingEvoltion]}}</ref> Furthermore, the support conversations take place at the base instead of in the battlefield.<ref name="''Base &mdash; not Battlefield''">{{cite news|title='Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance review'|url=http://www.n-philes.com/reviews.php?id=168|accessdate=2007-08-05|author=Matt Crowl|date=2005-12-01|work=[http://www.n-philes.com/ N-Philes]}}</ref> An option to re-read the support conversations as an extra feature is not available in this game as it was in previous ''Fire Emblem'' games. There is a section on the unit information screen that does show the specific statistical gains from support conversations; this wasn't available in the previous ''Fire Emblem'' games.

===Changes from Japanese version===
Releases outside of Japan omit the extremely hard "Maniac" mode, replacing it with "Easy" mode that is of lower difficulty than "Normal mode". Swordmasters, Berserkers and Snipers (unit classes) received a 15% boost to the critical rate (the chance to triple the damage of an attack), similar to those present in ''[[Fire Emblem (video game)|Fire Emblem]]'' and ''[[Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones]]''.<ref name="Localisation changes">{{cite news|title='Localisation changes 2'|url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/elaice/general/local3.html|accessdate=2007-07-25|date=2007-07-25|work=Serenes Forest}}</ref>
''Path of Radiance'' was the first ''Fire Emblem'' game to feature voice acting. This was limited in the Western versions but was utilised more in the Japanese version. In the Japanese version, there was voiced narration for all of the overworld map scenes and the ending cinema.
However, the narration was mostly left out in the English version, leaving only the ending cinema narration and the cutscenes.

==Graphics engine and musical score==
[[Image:Fe9mapscreenshot.png|thumb|180px|right|3D graphics in ''Path of Radiance''.]]
''Path of Radiance'' is the first ''Fire Emblem'' title to feature three-dimensional graphics on the battlefield, replacing two-dimensional sprite animations and landscapes with fully rendered 3-D models. It is also the first game in the series to make use of [[full motion video]] to present cinematic sequences at key points in the game. The FMV sequences were animated by [[Production I.G.]].<ref name="Production I'G">{{cite news|title='Gaming Evolution &mdash; Path of Radiance review'|url=http://www.gamingevolution.info/index.php?id=1463|accessdate=2007-08-05|date=|work=[http://www.gamingevolution.info/ GamingEvoltion}}</ref>

The ''Fire Emblem'' series' veteran music composer [[Yuka Tsujiyoko]] was actively involved in providing the musical score.<ref name="Music credits">{{cite news|title='Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance info'|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/gamecube/data/920189.html|accessdate=2007-08-05|date=|work=[http://www.gamefaqs.com/ GameFAQs]}}</ref> ''Path of Radiance'' is the first ''Fire Emblem'' game to feature a theme song with vocals, "Life Returns," which is sung in the fictional language of the heron tribe.
