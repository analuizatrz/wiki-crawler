"'''Pilot'''" is the first episode of the television series ''[[House (TV series)|House]]''. The episode premiered on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] network on November 16, 2004. It introduces the character of Dr. [[Gregory House]] (played by [[Hugh Laurie]])&mdash;a maverick antisocial doctor&mdash;and his team of diagnosticians at the fictional Princeton-Plainsboro [[Teaching Hospital]] in [[New Jersey]]. The episode features Dr. House's attempts to diagnose a grade-school teacher after she collapses in class.

''House'' was created by [[David Shore]], who got the idea for the curmudgeonly title character from a doctor's visit. Initially, producer [[Bryan Singer]] wanted an American to play House, but British actor Hugh Laurie's audition convinced him that a foreign actor could play the role. Shore wrote House as a character with parallels to [[Sherlock Holmes]]—both are drug users, aloof, and largely friendless. The show's producers wanted House handicapped in some way, and gave the character a damaged leg arising from an improper diagnosis.

The episode received generally positive reviews; the character of House was widely noted as a unique aspect of the episode and series, though reviewers such as Sherwin Nuland of ''[[Slate Magazine|Slate]]'' believed that such a cruel character would not be tolerated in real life. Other complaints with the episode included stereotyped supporting characters and an implausible premise. The initial broadcast of "Pilot" was watched by approximately seven million viewers, making it the sixty-second most-watched show of the week.

==Plot==
Shortly after the start of class, kindergarten teacher Rebecca Adler ([[Robin Tunney]]) becomes [[dysphasia|dysphasic]] and falls to the floor. Dr. [[James Wilson (House)|James Wilson]] ([[Robert Sean Leonard]]) attempts to convince the misanthropic Gregory House to treat Adler, but House dismisses him, citing boredom. When Wilson claims that the patient is his cousin, House agrees to take the case. Hospital administrator Dr. [[Lisa Cuddy]] ([[Lisa Edelstein]]) approaches House in the elevator and attempts to persuade him to fulfill his duties at the hospital's walk-in clinic, a task House loathes because of the uncomplicated nature of the cases brought to him. House refuses, claiming that Cuddy cannot fire him due to tenure, and hurriedly leaves. When House's team attempts to perform an [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] on Adler, they discover that House's authorization has been revoked by the administrator; Cuddy grants House authorization for diagnostics in exchange for his required attendance in the clinic.

During the MRI, Adler's throat closes up, prompting two members of House's team, Dr. [[Robert Chase]] ([[Jesse Spencer]]) and Dr. [[Allison Cameron (House)|Allison Cameron]] ([[Jennifer Morrison]]), to perform a [[tracheotomy]]. Working in the hospital's clinic, House treats a ten-year-old boy whose mother allows him to use his [[asthma]]tic [[inhaler]] only intermittently instead of daily as prescribed. House scolds the mother for making such a drastic medical decision without first learning more about asthma. During his monologue, House stumbles on an idea and leaves quickly to treat Adler; he diagnoses her with cerebral [[vasculitis]], despite having no proof. Adler temporarily improves greatly on a steroid treatment.

On House's insistence, neurologist Dr. [[Eric Foreman]] ([[Omar Epps]]) and Cameron break into Adler's house to find anything that might account for Adler's symptoms&mdash;seizures, dysphasia, and airway constriction. They find an opened package of sliced ham (which is not [[Kashrut|kosher]]) in Adler's kitchen, leading Foreman to reveal that Dr. Wilson had lied to House to convince him to treat Adler (Wilson is Jewish). House dismisses the lie and concludes that Adler is suffering from [[cysticercosis]] due to eating undercooked pork; the [[Cestoda|tapeworm]] inside of her reproduced, and its larvae were absorbed into her blood stream, infesting her brain. Adler, wishing to die with dignity, refuses to accept more treatments unless there is evidence that the diagnosis is correct, but House attempts to persuade her otherwise. During the conversation, Adler asks for the cause of the limp in House's right leg. House reveals he had an [[infarction]] in his thigh muscles that led to muscle death, which could have been avoided if his doctor had made the correct diagnosis. House continues, claiming that death is ugly and that Adler cannot die with dignity, but she still refuses treatment. House is ready to dismiss the case when Chase provides an idea for noninvasive evidence of Adler's tapeworm infection; using an [[X-ray]], House proves that Adler is infested with tapeworms and her condition is treatable. After seeing the evidence, Adler happily agrees to take her medication to kill the tapeworms.

===Conception and filming===
Series creator David Shore traced the concept for ''House'' to his background as a patient at a teaching hospital. Shore recalled that "I knew, as soon as I left the room, they would be mocking me relentlessly [for my cluelessness...] and I thought that it would be interesting to see a character who actually did that before they left the room."<ref name="hulu-developing the concept">{{cite web|author=Shore, David|year=2006|url=http://www.hulu.com/watch/21606/house-house---developing-the-concept#s-p2-st-i1|title=Developing The Concept|work=[[Hulu.com]]|publisher=[[The Paley Center for Media]]|accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref> In 2004, Shore and executive producers Katie Jacobs and Paul Attanasio pitched ''House'' to FOX as a medical detective show, a hospital [[whodunit]] where the doctors would be the sleuths looking for the source of symptoms. After the show was sold, the idea for House was added.<ref name="u of t">{{cite web|author=Gibson, Stacy|year=2008|month=Winter|url=http://www.magazine.utoronto.ca/08winter/david_shore.asp|title=The House that Dave Built|publisher=[[University of Toronto|University of Toronto Magazine]]|accessdate=2008-09-28}}</ref>

A central part of the show's premise was that the main character would be handicapped in some way. Initially, House was to be confined to a wheelchair, but FOX turned down this interpretation (for which the crew was later grateful.) The wheelchair became a scar on House's face, which later turned into a bad leg necessitating the use of a cane.<ref name="int-disability">{{cite web|author=Shore, David; Jacobs, Katie|year=2006|url=http://www.hulu.com/watch/21680/house-house---houses-disability#s-p2-st-i1|title=House's Disability|work=[[Hulu.com]]|publisher=[[The Paley Center for Media]]|accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref>

The episode was written by the series creator David Shore,<ref name="torontosun-laurie"/> and was shot in Canada; later episodes would be shot on soundstages in California.<ref>{{cite web|author=Staff|date=2006-01-29|url=http://www.etonline.com/tv/2006/01/35979/index.html|title=Behind the Scenes of 'House'|publisher=[[Entertainment Tonight]]|accessdate=2008-09-17}}</ref> Shore said that the writings of the [[Berton Roueché]], a ''[[The New Yorker]]'' staff writer who chronicled intriguing medical cases, inspired the plots for "Pilot" and other early episodes.<ref name="u of t"/>

===Casting===
[[Image:BryanSinger edited.jpg|thumb|right|Producer [[Bryan Singer]] initially thought actor Hugh Laurie was American.]]
Producer Bryan Singer originally demanded that an American actor play the role of House; according to Singer, the more foreign actors he watched audition for the part, the more sure he was that an American was needed. At the time of the casting session, actor Hugh Laurie was filming the movie ''[[Flight of the Phoenix (2004 film)|Flight of the Phoenix]]''. He put together an audition tape of his own in a Namibian hotel room, the only place with enough light,<ref>{{cite news|author=Keveney, Bill|date=2004-11-16|title=Hugh Laurie gets into 'House'|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2004-11-15-hugh-laurie_x.htm|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=2008-10-26}}</ref> and apologized for its appearance (which Singer compared to a "[[Osama Bin Laden|bin Laden]] video").<ref name="torontosun-laurie"/> Singer was impressed by Laurie's performance and commented on how well the "American actor" was able to grasp the character, not realizing Laurie is British.<ref name="hulu-developing the concept"/>

Laurie stated in an interview that he was initially under the impression the show was about Dr. James Wilson, with Dr. House as the "sidekick", because the script referred to House as a doctor with "boyish" looks. Laurie did not realize that House was the protagonist until he read the full teleplay.<ref name="Inside">{{cite episode |title=Hugh Laurie Interview |episodelink= |series=Inside the Actor's Studio |serieslink= |credits= |network=[[Bravo (US TV channel)|BRAVO Network]] |station= |airdate=2006 |season=12 |seriesno= |number=189 |minutes= }}</ref> According to Shore, "it's easy to make an asshole character unlikable. What's tricky is to make them watchable. And Hugh came in and brought everything that 
was there to the part, the nastiness, the not politically correct stuff. And yet you wanted to watch him, you wanted to spend time with him."<ref name="torontosun-laurie">{{cite news|author=Brioux, Bill|date=2004-11-14|title=Compelling 'House' Doctor|work=[[The Toronto Sun]]|page=TV2}}</ref>

Similarities between House and the famous fictional detective [[Sherlock Holmes]] appear in the pilot; Shore explained that he was always a Sherlock Holmes fan, and found the character's traits of indifference to his clients unique.<ref name="hulu-developing the concept"/> House and Holmes have only one real friend (Dr. Wilson and Dr. Watson, respectively) who connects the cerebral hero to human concerns. Both come to rapid conclusions after the briefest examination of a client or patient, and both use drugs ([[opium]] for Holmes, [[hydrocodone|Vicodin]] for House). House and Holmes share the same address, 221B. The main patient in the pilot is named Rebecca Adler, after [[Irene Adler]], a female character from the first Sherlock Holmes short story.<ref>{{cite news | author=Werts, Diane | title = 'House' thrives with inspiration from Sherlock Holmes | work = [[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] | date = 2006-09-04 | accessdate = 2006-12-30}}</ref>

Robert Sean Leonard (Dr. James Wilson) read the pilot scripts to ''[[Numb3rs]]'' and was planning to audition for the part, but was drawn to auditioning for ''House'' because he enjoyed the role of being "the guy [the protagonist] counts on", as well as the similarities to Sherlock Homes.<ref>{{cite web|author=Leonard, Robert|year=2006|url=http://www.hulu.com/watch/21682/house-house---robert-sean-leonard-on-his-audition#s-p1-st-i1|title=Robert Sean Leonard On His Audition|work=[[Hulu.com]]|publisher=[[The Paley Center for Media]]|accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref> Leonard stated that he did not think he auditioned well, but that his long friendship with Singer helped land him the role.<ref>{{cite web|author=Wolk, Josh|date=2007-07-03|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20044586,00.html|title=A Summer Away from the 'House'|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=2008-09-18}}</ref> When asked in an interview why his character would ever be friends with House, Leonard replied:

{{quote|I think Wilson puts up with House for the same reason that millions of people watch him every week. I think he’s really dynamic and fun and audacious and self-deprecating. All those things that I think make people really appealing, and he tells it like it is. The money things, he doesn’t tend to pay you back, but I have a lot of friends like that. So I don’t find it that much of a mystery. I think House is a very attractive character.

Australian actor Jesse Spencer's agent suggested that Spencer audition for the role of Chase, but he was hesitant, fearing the show might be similar to ''[[General Hospital]]''.
