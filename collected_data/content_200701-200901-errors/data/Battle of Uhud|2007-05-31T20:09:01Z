The '''Battle of Uhud''' ({{lang-ar|غزوة أحد}}) was fought on 22 March, [[625]],<ref name="W136"/> between a force from the small [[Muslim]] community of [[Medina]], in what is now north-western [[Arabia]], and a force from [[Mecca]], the town from which many of the Muslims had emigrated (''[[Hijra (Islam)|hijra]]''). [[Mount Uhud]], the location of the battle, is near Medina. The Battle of Uhud was the second military encounter between the Meccans and the Muslims, preceded by the [[Battle of Badr]] in [[624]], where a small Muslim army had defeated the larger Meccan army.

The Muslims had the worst of the affair and retired after having lost some seventy-five men. However, the Meccans did not pursue the Muslims into Medina, but marched back to Mecca. The battle is generally regarded as a victory for the Meccans and a serious setback for the Muslims. [[William Montgomery Watt|Watt]], in his 1956 account of the battle, disagrees; he concludes that while the Muslims did not win, the Meccans themselves had suffered some losses and did not feel strong enough to attack the Muslims in their stronghold. Since the Meccans had embarked on the venture with an eye to subduing the Muslims entirely, their mission had actually failed (pp. 27-29). 

== Prelude == 
[[Muhammad]] had preached his message of [[Islam]] in Mecca from [[613]] to [[622]]. He had attracted a small, tight-knit community of followers, but had also succeeded in angering the rest of the [[Quraysh]], the clan that ruled Mecca and to which he belonged. After years of persecution, the Muslims fled Mecca in 622 and established themselves at Medina. They considered themselves to be in a state of war with Mecca and raided Meccan caravans. The Meccans sent out a small army to punish the Muslims and stop their raiding. At the [[Battle of Badr]] in 624, a small Muslim force defeated the much larger Meccan army.<ref>Peters (1994) pp. 211—214</ref> 

Many Muslims considered this unexpected victory a proof that they had been favored by God ([[Allah]]), and believed they were assured such victories in the future.<ref name="W1423">Watt (1964) pp. 142—143</ref> A number of the leading tribesmen of Quraysh had been killed at Badr, and so leadership passed to [[Abu Sufyan]]. He forbade the mourning of the losses at Badr, for he was eager to exact revenge upon Muhammad, promising to conduct a raid on the city of Medina. Several months later, Abu Sufyan accompanied a party of 200 men to the city, obtaining temporary residence with the chief of a [[Jewish]] tribe and learning more of the current situation in Medina. He then left the city, burning two houses and laying waste to some fields in fulfillment of his vow. Further skirmishes between the Meccans and the Muslims would occur thereafter.<ref>Watt (1964) pp. 132—135</ref>

== The Meccan force sets out == 
Defeat by the Muslims the Battle of Badr had infuriated the Meccans, who now wanted revenge for their dead kinsmen. The following year on 11 March 625 with Abu Sufyan at the helm, they raised another force, often numbered at 3000, and set out for the Muslim base in Medina. Rather than attacking Medina itself, which was populated by numerous strongholds that would have required long sieges to overcome, they camped on the pastures north of the city, hoping that the Muslims would come out to meet them.<ref name="Uhud">"Uhud", ''Encyclopedia of Islam Online''</ref><ref>Watt (1964) p. 135</ref>

Muhammad soon learned of the Meccan army's presence and numbers through a scout late on Thursday. The next morning, at the Muslim conference of war, there was dispute over how best to repel the Meccans. Muhammad and many of the senior figures suggested that it would be safer to fight within Medina and take advantage of its heavily fortified strongholds. Younger Muslims argued that the Meccans were destroying their crops, and that huddling in the strongholds would destroy Muslim prestige. Muhammad eventually conceded to the wishes of the latter, and readied the Muslim force for battle.<ref name="Uhud" /><ref name="W137">Watt (1964) p. 137</ref>

== The battle == 
A group of approximately 1000 men set out on late Friday from Medina and managed to circle around the Meccan forces. Early the next morning, they took a position on the lower slopes of the hill of Uhud. Shortly before the battle commenced, '[[Abdullah ibn Ubayy]] (the chief of the [[Khazraj]] tribe) and his followers withdrew their support for Muhammad and returned to Medina, with reports suggesting Ibn Ubayy's discontent with the plan to march out from Medina to the Meccans. Ibn Ubayy and his followers would later receive censure in the Qur'an for this act.<ref name="W137" />

The Meccan forces lay between the Muslim forces and the center of Medina. The Meccans attacked, but their initial charge was driven back by Muslim [[archer]]s. The Muslims, enjoying the best of the early encounters, surged forward, with victory appearing certain. A detachment of archers had previously been posted on a hill to defend an extremity of the Muslim flank; however, this force disobeyed its initial orders and ran downhill to join in the advance and despoil the Meccan camp, leaving the flank vulnerable.<ref name="Uhud" /><ref name="W89">Watt (1964) pp. 138-139</ref>

At this critical juncture, a Meccan cavalry led by [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]] (later famous as a Muslim general) exploited this move by the Muslim archers, and attacked their remnants still positioned on the hill. From here, they were then able to target and overrun the Muslim flank and rear. Confusion ensued, and numerous Muslims were killed. In the midst of this, rumors had circulated that Muhammad too had perished. It emerged, however, that Muhammad had not been killed, only wounded.<ref name="Uhud" /><ref name="W89" />

After fierce hand-to-hand combat, most of the Muslims managed to withdraw and regroup higher up on the slopes of Uhud. A small faction was cut off and tried to make its way back to Medina, though many of these were killed. The Meccans' chief offensive arm, its cavalry, was unable to ascend the slopes of Uhud in pursuit of the Muslims, and so the fighting ceased. Abu Sufyan, after some brief verbal exchanges with [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]] (a companion of Muhammad), decided to return to Mecca without pressing his advantage.<ref name="Uhud" /><ref name="W89" /> An early Muslim historian, [[Waqidi]], records [[Amr ibn al-A'as]] as saying: 

:''When we renewed the attack against them, we smote a certain number of them, and they scattered in every direction, but later a party of them rallied. Quraysh then took counsel together and said, The victory is ours, let us depart. For we had heard that [[Abdallah ibn Ubayy|Ibn Ubayy]] had retired with a third of the force, and some of the Aws and the Khazraj had stayed away from the battle, and we were not sure that they would not attack us. Moreover we had a number of wounded, and all our horses had been wounded by the arrows. So they set off. We had not reached ar-Rawha until a number of them came against us and we continued on our way.''<ref>Watt (1981) p. 432</ref>

Watt explains this last comment by saying that Muhammad realized that a show of force was required to speed the Meccans out of Medina's territory. Therefore he sent a small force out towards Hamra al-Asad to harry the Meccans.

== Hind == 
According to the early Muslim historian [[Ibn Ishaq]], a number of Meccan women are said to have accompanied Abu Sufyan's army, including [[Hind bint Utbah]], his wife. When the Meccans surged into battle, she and the other women stood at the rear, beating tambourines and urging their men forward. She is said to have sung:

: ''On ye sons of 'Abdul-Dar,''
: ''On protectors of our rear,''
: ''Smite with every sharpened spear!''

and

: ''If you advance we hug you,''
: ''Spread soft rugs beneath you;''
: ''If you retreat we leave you,''
: ''Leave and no more love you.''<ref>Guillaume 813</ref>

After the Muslims left the field of battle, Hind and her companions are said to have mutilated the Muslim corpses, cutting off their ears and noses and making the gruesome relics into anklets. Hind is said to have cut open the corpse of [[Hamza ibn 'Abdul Muttalib|Hamza]], Muhammad's uncle, and taken out Hamza's liver, which she then attempted to eat.<ref>Ibn Ishaq (1955) 380—388, cited in Peters (1994) p. 218</ref>

== The Muslim reaction to the setback == 
Watt regards this battle as a setback rather than a defeat. To the Muslims, however, it was a shock. They had expected another victory like Badr. Instead, they had barely held off the invaders and had lost a great many men. This was a large loss to a small community. The usual Muslim explanation for the defeat is that the Muslim forces were on the verge of success when they stopped to loot the Meccan tents. They believed that the fight had been won and they were free to loot. Their greed for loot had blinded them to the actual military situation. The Muslims had forfeited the favor of Allah and had to be humbled. The proper response to the setback was not despair, but renewed determination and faith. 

Watt doubts that the Muslims had advanced as far as the Meccan tents, and believes that the superior generalship of [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]] (so amply demonstrated in his later career as a Muslim general) may perhaps account for the Meccan success.

== The historical record ==
Much of the surviving historical material on early Islamic history consists of old soldiers' tales. Scholars like Ibn Ishaq and Waqidi interviewed the families of the earliest Muslims, writing down the recollections they had heard from their elders. Inevitably, a great many of these recollections consist of accounts of the bravery of the soldier in question, and emphatic denials that he was ever part of the contingent of greedy archers believed to have lost Uhud for the Muslims. 

The record is complicated by later civil wars between Muslims, in which they split into parties and fought for control of the empire. All parties to the conflict were tempted to rewrite the past so as to depict their opponents as feckless cowards. Thus [[Shi'a]] accounts of Uhud depict the first three caliphs ([[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]], and [[Uthman ibn Affan]]), caliphs hated by the Shi'a as usurpers, as cowards who fled the scene of battle. [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]], followed by the Shi'a, is believed to have been the bravest of the warriors at Uhud. [[Sunni]] accounts of the battle differ. Ibn Ishaq, for example, describes in great detail the exploits of Abu Dujana and Hamza. He mentions Ali only as giving water to Muhammad after the battle.
