'''''Kylie''''' is the debut [[album]] by Australian [[Pop music|pop]] singer [[Kylie Minogue]]. It was released by [[PWL]] on 4 July 1988, and received mixed reviews. Chris True of [[Allmusic]] describes the album's songs as "dated at best", but writes that Minogue's "cuteness makes these rather vapid tracks bearable".<ref>True, Chris.

Retrieved 1 October 2007.</ref> ''Kylie'' was a number one album in the United Kingdom, and it produced three number one singles in Australia. In North America the album peaked low on the [[Billboard charts]], yet still impressively managed to sell over 500,000 copies and was certified gold.<ref name="offical">[http://www.kylie.com/2006_site/music/kylie.htm "Albums: ''Kylie''"]. Kylie.com. Retrieved 1 October 2007.</ref>

In Australia, the album was re-issued as ''[[The Kylie Collection]]'' and featured bonus [[remix]]es. In January 1989, ''Kylie'' was certified [[Music recording sales certification|six times platinum]] in the UK,<ref name="bpi">[http://www.bpi.co.uk/platinum/platinumright.asp?rq=search_plat&r_id=24020 "British sales certificate for 'Kylie'"].

==Background and recording==
In 1987, during a [[Fitzroy Football Club]] [[benefit concert]] with other ''[[Neighbours]]'' cast members, Minogue performed a [[cover version]] of "[[The Loco-Motion]]" and was signed to a recording contract with [[Mushroom Records]].<ref>Smith, Sean (2002). ''Kylie Confidential''. Michael O'Mara Books Limited. ISBN 1-85479-415-9.</ref> The song was released as a single in Australia, and became the highest selling single of the 1980s.<ref>[http://www.kylie.com/2006_site/music/locomotion.htm "Singles: The Locomotion"]. Kylie.com. Retrieved 2 October 2007.</ref> Its success resulted in Minogue traveling to [[London]] with Mushroom Records executive Gary Ashley to work with [[Stock Aitken Waterman|Stock, Aitken and Waterman]]. They knew little of Minogue and had forgotten that she was arriving; as a result, they wrote "[[I Should Be So Lucky]]" while she waited outside the studio.<ref name="transcript">[http://web.archive.org/web/20060107160910/http://www.abc.net.au/love/episodes/transcript4.htm "Transcript of television documentary ''Love is in the Air'', episode title "I Should Be So Lucky""]. [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC Television]]. 2 November 2003. Retrieved 2 October 2007.</ref> Minogue recorded the song in less than an hour, and returned home to Australia to work on ''Neighbours''.<ref name="transcript"/> The song became a chart success, and [[Mike Stock]] traveled to [[Melbourne]] to apologize to Minogue for forgetting about her previous recording session. Stock successfully convinced Minogue to return to London in the beginning of 1988 to record songs for her debut album.<ref name="transcript"/>

==Chart performance and sales==

Stock believed that although Minogue was a successful soap star in Australia and very talented, there must be something wrong with her and figured that she must be unlucky in love.<ref name="transcript"/> It became a number one hit for Minogue in Australia and the United Kingdom.<ref name="chrono"/> "[[Got to Be Certain]]", the third single, reached number one in Australia, and was moderately successful in other parts of the world, reaching number two in the UK and the top ten in Germany and [[Switzerland]].<ref>[http://www.kylie.com/2006_site/music/got_to_be_certain.htm "Discography: Got to Be Certain"].
