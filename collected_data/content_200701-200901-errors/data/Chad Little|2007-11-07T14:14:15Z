'''Chad Little''' (born [[April 23]], [[1963]] in [[Spokane, Washington]]) is a former [[NASCAR]] driver. He holds a degree in [[marketing]] from [[Washington State University]], and a [[law degree]] from [[Gonzaga University]].  While attending Washington State University he joined the [[Delta Upsilon]] Fraternity.

Little currently works as NASCAR Director of Racing Development for Mexico, and oversees the [[NASCAR Mexico]] organization. He keeps regular office hours in the sanctioning body's research and development center in Concord, N.C. He also was a part-time studio [[analyst]] for [[Speed Channel]]. 

In 1989, he missed [[United Airlines Flight 232]]. Approximately half of the passengers aboard the flight perished during its [[emergency landing]] in [[Iowa]].

== Early years ==
Little began racing the short tracks in [[Washington]] in the mid-1980s. He soon began [[American Speed Association|American Speed Association West Late Model series]], the [[NASCAR Northwest Tour Series]] and the [[NASCAR Winston West Series]]. One year after being named the NASCAR Winston West Rookie of the Year, Little clinched that series' championship in 1987.

Little made his NASCAR [[Winston Cup]] debut in [[1986 in NASCAR|1986]] at [[Riverside International Raceway]], driving the #28 [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] owned by George Jefferson. He started 25th and finished 13th. He ran the other Riverside race that year, but finished 35th after suffering engine failure. He ran both the Riverside races the next year, finishing 15th both times in the #95 [[Coors]] Ford. In [[1988 in NASCAR|1988]].

The following year, Little declared for [[NASCAR Winston Cup Rookie of the Year]] honors and signed to drive the #90 for [[Junie Donlavey]]. Unfortunately, his best finish was an eighteenth at the [[Coca-Cola 600]], and he was released early in the season. In [[1990 in NASCAR|1990]], Little and his father Chuck teamed to field their own entry, the #19 Ford sponsored by [[Bull’s Eye Barbecue Sauce]]. He ran eighteen races and had seven top-twenty finishes, garnering a 33rd place points finish. The following season, Little made his first full-time attempt at winning the Cup championship, qualifying for 28 out of 29 races and posting a tenth-place finish at [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]], finishing 27th in points.

== Busch Series ==
In [[1992 in NASCAR|1992]], Little signed to drive the #66 [[TropArctic]] Ford for [[Cale Yarborough]], but was released six races into the season. Later he caught on to the #9 Ford fielded by [[Melling Racing]], and had an eighth place finish at [[Talladega Superspeedway|Talladega]]. He also made his [[Busch Series]] debut that year, starting and finishing 29th in the #37 [[Maxx Race Cards]] [[Oldsmobile]] at [[Watkins Glen International]].

In [[1993 in NASCAR Busch Series|1993]], Little, along with [[Greg Pollex]] and former NFL quarterback [[Mark Rypien]], formed [[Mark Rypien Motorsports]], running the #23 [[If It’s Paper]]/[[Bayer Select]] Ford on a limited basis that year, posting a second-place finish at [[Dover International Speedway]]. The next year, the team went full-time and Little had ten top-five finishes, finishing third in points. He also drove the #97 Ford at the [[Daytona 500]] that season, finishing 29th. In [[1995 in NASCAR Busch Series|1995]], Little broke through and won six races during the course of the season, including the first two races of the season at Daytona and Rockingham, and finished 2nd in points, behind Johnny Benson. His other wins were at Loudon, Charlotte, Talladega and South Boston. Little did not win a race the following season, however, and slipped to sixth in points. He also ran nine Cup races, five in Pollex’s #97 [[Sterling Cowboy]] [[Pontiac Grand Prix]], and another four for [[Diamond Ridge Motorsports]], posting a twentieth-place finish at [[Darlington Raceway]],

== Winston Cup ==
In [[1997 in NASCAR|1997]], Little returned to the Cup series, running the #97 Pontiac for Pollex with sponsorship from [[John Deere]]. He finished seventh at the [[Food City 500]], but the team struggled making races. Late in the year, [[Jack Roush]] purchased the team to be added to his stable for [[1998 in NASCAR|1998]]. Little ended 1997 36th in points.

In 1998, Little drove for Roush full-time. Running 32 out of 33 races, he had seven top-tens, including a second-place run at [[Texas Motor Speedway|Texas]], finishing behind Mark Martin, and finished a career-high 15th in points. He was unable to duplicate that performance in [[1999 in NASCAR|1999]], posting just five top-tens and finishing 23rd in points. After just one top-ten in [[2000 in NASCAR|2000]], Roush announced Little would not drive the 97 the following season. Late in the year, Little was pulled out of the car and replaced by his successor, [[Kurt Busch]]. During the season, he also ran a handful of races in the Busch Series. Originally running the #30 for [[Innovative Motorsports]], he was released and posted a top-ten in a one-race deal with [[PPI Motorsports]]. 

Little had 217 career Cup starts in all.

== Final years ==
In [[2001 in NASCAR Busch Series|2001]], Little signed to drive the #74 [[Staff America]] [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]] for [[BACE Motorsports]] in the Busch Series . He had six top-tens and finished 9th in points. He started of [[2002 in NASCAR Busch Series|2002]] running for BACE, but the team closed due to sponsor issues. He made his final Cup start in a BACE car at Dover that year, finishing 33rd. He has not run NASCAR since.

Chad is now working to provide competition support for the [[NASCAR Mexico Corona Series]].
