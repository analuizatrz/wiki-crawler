The '''Shamrock''' was a [[hotel]] constructed between [[1946]] and [[1949]] by [[wildcatter]] [[Glenn McCarthy]] southwest of [[Downtown Houston|downtown Houston]], [[Texas]] next to the [[Texas Medical Center]]. It was the largest hotel built in the United States during the 1940s. Within a few years the facility was sold to the [[Hilton Hotels|Hilton]] hotel chain and operated for over three decades as the Shamrock Hilton, enduring financial struggles throughout its history.

==Design and construction==
Designed by [[Fort Worth]] architect Wyatt C. Hedrick, the eighteen-story building with a green tile pitched roof and 1,100 rooms was conceived by McCarthy as a city-sized hotel scaled for conventions but set in a suburban location with a resort atmosphere, three miles southwest of downtown Houston at the acute southwest corner of Main Street and West Holcombe Boulevard. At the time this was on the fringes of countryside and meant to be the first phase of a much larger indoor shopping and entertainment complex called McCarthy Center, anchored alongside the planned Texas Medical Center. At the hotel's north side was a five-story building containing a 1,000-car garage and 25,000-square-foot exhibition hall. To the south was the hotel's lavishly landscaped garden designed by Ralph Ellis Gunn, a terrace and an immense swimming pool measuring 165 by 142 feet described as the world's biggest outdoor pool, which could accommodate exhibition [[waterskiing]] and featured a 3 story-high diving platform with an open spiral staircase. Three penthouse apartments on the top floor would each have a monthly rent equal to an average family's yearly income. Construction was completed for about $21,000,000 (equivalent to over half a billion dollars in 2007).<ref> http://www.tsha.utexas.edu/handbook/online/articles/SS/ccs5.html The general contractors were Stone and Webster Construction Company and the Tellepsen Construction Company.</ref>

Hotel industry executives flatly warned McCarthy the project would not be profitable. He publicly replied, "I went into the oil business in 1933 when everybody said I was a damn fool. Now they're saying it again about my hotel."<ref>Time Magazine, ''[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,933841-1,00.html Luck of the Irish], 21 March 1949.</ref>

The 5,000-square-foot lobby was paneled in burled mahogany with added trim heavily influenced by [[Art Deco]], a design movement which had been popular during the 1920s and 30s. McCarthy ordered furnishings and decor in 63 shades of [[green]], a nod to his ancestral Ireland. However, Hedrick's conservative design for the building's exterior along with its lavish interiors by Robert D. Harrell of Los Angeles drew wide criticism, notably from [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] who while being shown the completed facility before it opened, pointed at the lobby ceiling and said to [[Fay Jones]], "That, young man, is an example of the effects of venereal disease on architecture." McCarthy claimed the decor represented "the best of all periods." Time magazine described it as "eclectic." The building's structural design has since been characterized as "more robust and sturdy than sleek and futuristic."<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,811889-1,00.html Time magazine]</ref><ref> http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9904E7D8133BF93AA15751C1A963948260&sec=travel&spon=&pagewanted=1</ref><ref>New Works Review, Gene Lockard, ''[http://www.new-works.org/8_3lockard/shamrock.htm Remembering the Shamrock]'', retrieved 23 September 2007</ref>

==Notorious grand opening==
The hotel opened with fireworks displays on [[St. Patrick’s Day]] [[1949]]. Two thousand Houstonians paid $42 a person to have dinner at what was widely publicized as “Houston’s biggest party," attended by over 150 [[Hollywood]] celebrities including [[Ginger Rogers]], [[Hedda Hopper]] and [[Errol Flynn]] along with noted Los Angeles business executives and reporters, some of whom were flown in to [[Houston Municipal Airport]] on a customized [[Boeing 307]] Stratoliner airplane which McCarthy had bought only days earlier from [[Howard Hughes]]. Many more were brought in by train on a chartered [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Santa Fe]] [[Super Chief]]. The festivities became so raucous that a radio broadcast from the hotel by actress, singer and [[World War 2|wartime]] [[pinup girl]] [[Dorothy Lamour]] was cut off by the network (Lamour reportedly fled the stage in tears). [[Life magazine]] called it "...the most dazzling exhibition of evening dresses and big names ever seen in Texas. Everyone had to concede it was quite a party and quite a hotel." The grand opening of the Shamrock is still cited as one of the biggest social events in Houston’s history.<ref>http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4203/ch1-1.htm</ref><ref name="HT-SHAMR">Stephen Fox.

==Operation==
The Shamrock initially had a staff of 1,200 managed by George Lindholm, who had been recruited from the socially prominent [[Waldorf-Astoria]] hotel in [[New York City|New York]]. There were 23 different employee uniforms. Guests signed the register in "grass-hued" green ink and their luggage was carried by [[bellhop]]s wearing emerald green, lemon trimmed uniforms past a portrait of McCarthy in the elevator lobby to air-conditioned, green-hued rooms with generously framed abstract art on the walls, push-button radios (including recorded music from an elaborate in-house system through which an operator played extended-length [[grammophone|transcription discs]]) and television, all somewhat rare amenities for a hotel at the time. Celebrity singers (including Lamour) performed in the hotel's nightclub, called the Emerald Room. From 1949 to [[1953]] the Shamrock hosted a network radio program called ''Saturday at the Shamrock'' carried by the [[American Broadcasting Corporation]], then the only nationally broadcast scripted radio program produced outside New York or Los Angeles.<ref> http://www.tsha.utexas.edu/handbook/online/articles/SS/ccs5.html</ref>

However the Shamrock soon began experiencing persistent problems with occupancy rates and was seldom if ever full. McCarthy had spent lavishly, then borrowed heavily against his assets (including the hotel) to leverage a series of risky investments and his cash reserves quickly dwindled. Within a year Lindholm quietly resigned. In [[1952]] McCarthy defaulted on a loan and the hotel was acquired by Equitable Life Assurance Society. That same year author [[Edna Ferber]] described the Shamrock as the "Emperador" in her novel ''Giant'' (and it was later featured in the [[1956]] [[Giant (film)|film adaptation]] directed by [[George Stevens]]). Despite financial troubles the resort-like Shamrock with its restaurants, bars and swank shops had become a popular gathering place for local society and was characterized as "Houston's Riviera" during the early 1950s. The Shamrock's private and sleek Cork Club was noted as the site of many oil deals (and reportedly, fist fights). In [[1953]] singer Patty Andrews of the [[Andrews Sisters]] launched her brief solo career in the hotel's still somewhat fashionable nightclub.<ref>Fuermann, George, ''Houston, Land of the Big Rich'' (1951)</ref>

===Shamrock Hilton===
In [[1954]] the [[Hilton Hotels Corporation]] assumed management of the hotel and bought the property at a discount from its construction costs in [[1955]] but also struggled to find a profitable model for the huge facility, later shown to be isolated from both downtown Houston and its growing system of [[freeway]]s. Moreover the Shamrock was overwhelmed by competition from many much smaller, cheaper and automobile-friendly [[motel]]s. A low two-story "lanai" wing in the form of a motel was added next to the swimming pool in 1957. Meanwhile affluent [[suburb]]an home buyers bypassed the area and the planned shopping and entertainment center was never built (although McCarthy's concept influenced the successful [[Houston Galleria]] which opened near an intersection of freeways on the city's west side in [[1970]]). The hotel remained popular for Houston social events such as [[debutante ball]]s, [[barbecue]]s and business meetings, continuing operations as the Shamrock Hilton until [[1986]], by which time even its local reputation had long since faded.

==Demolition==
During a severe local recession in [[1985]] the 36-year-old hotel, still the second largest in Houston but by then in need of extensive refurbishing and refitting, was in effect donated to the Texas Medical Center. In March 1986 a protest rally was held by historic preservationists including McCarthy but the building was demolished on June 1, 1987 (McCarthy died 18 months later) and the land was paved over as a surface parking lot. Three small medical buildings have since been built on the site and ironically, along with fountains and some landscaping on the northeast grounds, the hotel's multi-story parking garage was retained.<ref name="HOU_BIZ_JOUR">Staff Writer.
