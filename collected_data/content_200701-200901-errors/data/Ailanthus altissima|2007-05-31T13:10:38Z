'''''Ailanthus altissima''''', commonly known as '''Tree of Heaven''', simply '''Ailanthus''', or in Chinese as '''Chouchun''' ({{zh-stp|s=臭椿|t=臭椿|p=chòuchūn}}), is a [[deciduous]] tree in the [[Simaroubaceae|quassia family]]. It is native to northeastern and central [[China]] as well as [[Taiwan]]. An exceptional member of the genus, it is found in temperate climates rather than the tropics like all the other ''Ailanthus'' species. The tree grows rapidly and has been found to reach heights of 15 metres (50 feet) in just 25 years.<ref name="USDF">{{cite web| last =Miller| first =James H.| authorlink =| coauthors =Yawney, Harry W. | title =Ailanthus altissima| work = Silvics of Forest Trees of the United States, Volume 2| publisher = United States Department of Forestry| date =1965, revised December 1990| url =http://na.fs.fed.us/pubs/silvics_manual/volume_2/ailanthus/altissima.htm| format =| doi =| accessdate =2007-05-29}}</ref> However, they are also short lived and rarely reach beyond 50 years in age. The common name as well as the genus are derived from an East Indian word ''aylanto'', meaning "heaven-tree" or "tree reaching for the sky". Other common names include china sumac, copal tree, stinktree and ghetto palm.

''A. altissima'' has been introduced to many areas beyond its native range, in many of which it has become a serious invasive species. The plant was first brought to [[Europe]] in 1751 by the French [[Jesuit]] Pierre Nicholas d'Incarville, who sent seeds to [[England]] from [[Nanking]]. It was initially received positively, for during this time Chinese taste was already popular in European architecture, furniture and porcelain design: the so called ''chinoiserie''. Furthermore, the tree of heaven was one of the first trees introduced from China, making it a very exotic garden specimen. The tree was introduced into the [[United States]] in 1784 by William Hamilton, a [[Philadelphia]] plant collector, along with other Chinese trees such as [[Ginkgo]]. Shortly after its introduction it began to be seen in a more negative light due to its suckering habits and it's offensive odour, though it was a popular street tree during much of the 19th century. <ref name="harvard">{{cite journal| last =Shah| first =Behula| authorlink =| coauthors =| title = The Checkered Career of ''Ailanthus altissima'' | journal =Arnoldia

==Description==
[[Image:Ailanthus altissima1.jpg|thumb|left|Seeds]]
''A. altissima'' is a medium-size tree that reaches heights between 17 and 27 metres (56 and 90 feet) with a  diameter at breast height of about 1 metre (40 inches).<ref name=USDF/> The [[bark]] is smooth and light grey, often becoming somewhat rougher with light tan fissures as the tree ages. The twigs are stout, smooth to lightly pubescent and reddish or chestnut in colour. They have lenticels as well as heart shaped leaf scars with many bundle scars around the margin. The [[bud]]s are finely pubescent, dome shaped, and partially hidden behind the petiole, though they are completley visible in the dormant season at the sinuses of the leaf scars.<ref name=harvard2/> The branches are light to dark gray in colour, smooth, lustrous and containing raised lenticels the become fissures with age. They are pendulous at the distal ends.  All parts of the plant have a strong odour that is often likened to rotting peanuts or cashews, which distinguishes the species from similar plants.<ref name=invasive>{{cite web

The [[leaf|leaves]] are large, odd or even pinnately compound, and arranged alternately on the stem. They range in size from 30 to 90 cm (1 to 3 feet) in length, with the largest leaves being present on vigorous young sprouts, and contain 10-41 leaflets. The [[rachis]] is light to reddish green with swollen bases. The [[leaflet]]s are ovate-lanceolate with entire margins, somewhat asymmetric and ocassionly not directly opposite on another. Each leaflet is 5 to 18 cm (2 to 7 inches) long and 2.5 to 5 cm (1 to 2 inches) wide. They have a long tapering apex, while the bases have 2 to 4 gladular teeth, each containing one or more glands at the tip.<ref name="harvard2">{{cite journal| last =Hu| first =Shiu-ying| authorlink =| coauthors =| title = ''Ailanthus altissima'' | journal =Arnoldia

The [[petiole]]s are 5 to 12 mm (0.2 to 0.5 inches) long.<ref name=invasive/> The lobed bases and glands distinguish it from similar [[rhus|sumac]] species.

The [[flower]]s are small and appear in large [[panicle]]s up to 50 cm (20 inches) in length at the end of new shoots. The individual flowers are yellowish green to reddish in colour, each with 5 [[petal]]s and 5 [[sepal]]s.<ref name=USDF/><ref name=invasive/> They appear from mid-April in the south of its range to July in the north. ''A. altissima'' is [[plant sexuality|dioecious]], with male and female flowers being borne on different individuals. Male trees produce three to four times as many flowers as the females, making the male flowers more conspicuous. Furthermore, the males emit a foul smelling odour while flowering to attract pollinating insects. Female flowers contain 10 (or rarely 5 through abortion) sterile [[stamen]]s, or stamenoides, as well as 5 carpels with a slender styles and star-shaped stigmas.<ref name=harvard2/> The [[seed]]s borne on the female trees are 5 mm in diameter and each is encapsulated in a [[Samara (fruit)|samara]] that is 2.5 cm long (1 inch) and 1 cm broad, appearing July though August, but usually persisting on the tree until the next spring. The samara is twisted at the tips making it spin as it falls and assisting wind dispersal.<ref name=USDF/><ref name=invasive/> The females can produce huge amounts of seeds, normally around 30,000 per kilogram of tree tree.<ref name=USDF/>

==Taxonomy==
There are two [[variety (biology)|varieties]] of ''A. altissima'':
*''A. altissima'' var. ''altissima'', which is the type variety and is native in [[mainland China]].
*''A. altissima'' var. ''tanakai'', which is endemic in northern [[Taiwan]] at medium to high altitudes. It differs from the type in having yellowish bark, odd-pinnate leaves that are also shorter on average at 45 to 60 cm long with only 13-25 leaflets.<ref name=taiwan>{{cite web

==Ecology==
[[Image:Ailanthus altissima (female).jpg|thumb|right|a female tree growing in [[Chicago, Illinois]] ]]
Ailanthus is an opportunistic species, thriving in full sun and in disturbed areas. It does, however, exhibit some shade tolerance. It spreads aggressively both by seeds and vegetatively, through root sprouts. It can resprout rapidly after being cut. Ailanthus is among the most tolerant of all tree species to pollution, including [[sulfur dioxide]], and high soil acidity such as that from acid mine drainage (as low as pH 4.1). It has been noted as drought-tolerant, storing water in its root system. It is frequently found along highways and railroad tracks, in abandoned lots in cities, on abandoned mining sites, and in other areas where few trees can survive. Along highways it often forms dense thickets in which few other tree species are present.

Ailanthus produces [[allelopathy|allelopathic chemicals]], which inhibit the growth of other plants. Resistance in various plant species has been shown to increase with exposure; populations without prior exposure to the chemicals are most susceptible to them. A few plants are resistant to these chemicals and form associations with Ailanthus in areas where it is dominant, such as along highways.

People have suggested many factors to Ailanthus' success at naturalising, including the absence of insects eating the plant, lack of exposure of native plants to the Ailanthus' allelopathy, and the widespread human disturbances which favour the tree. Regional variation has begun to show throughout its range, with trees in the colder northern regions producing heavier seeds than those in warmer regions.

==Distribution==
{{Wmog|Ailanthus altissima}}
It was first introduced to [[Europe]] ([[France]] and [[England]]) by a French [[Jesuit]] priest returning from [[Nanking]] in [[1751]], and the [[United States]] by [[William Hamilton]], a gardener in [[Philadelphia]] in [[1784]]. It soon became a favoured ornamental tree in parks and gardens, and by [[1840]], it was available in many nurseries. As a second point of entry, the tree was brought to [[California]] by Chinese immigrants who worked the gold mines. To this day many abandoned mines have large colonies of it.

===Control===
Tree of Heaven has become a problematic [[invasive species]] in many areas with warm temperate climates, including [[Africa]], the [[Americas]], [[Australia]], [[Europe]], and [[New Zealand]]. In Europe, it is a problem from [[Bulgaria]] west to [[Portugal]] and north to [[Germany]], and in the Americas from southern [[Canada]] south to [[Argentina]]. In the [[United States]] it is listed as invasive in 44 states, [[Washington D.C.]] and [[Puerto Rico]]. [http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/ailalt/distribution_and_occurrence.html]

Because of its aggressive spread, vigorous growth, allergenic and allelopathic chemicals, it has become a problem in many areas, out-competing native species. It often grows directly up against a building or structure, where the roots can damage sewers and housing foundations.  The trees grow rapidly and produce many offspring in their root vicinity, which also grow rapidly.  They also shed many small branches at regular intervals.  Digging or breaking the saplings yields an unpleasant smell and a sticky liquid.  However, due to their sunlight requirements, their invasive behavior occurs mainly in urban areas and along railroads, roadsides and cleared fields; they are not as successful in invading an already wooded area.

Cutting alone is not sufficient to kill the tree, as it resprouts quickly and abundantly, so eradication programs generally resort to herbicides.

==Uses==
Tree of Heaven is a popular [[ornamental tree]] in China, valued for its tolerance of difficult growing conditions.  Its popularity faded in the United States because of the disagreeable odor of its blossoms, although this has been avoided by selling pistillate plants because the unpleasant odor pertains almost wholly to the staminate flowers.<ref name=Keeler>{{cite book

The leaves are also used to feed [[silkworm]]s of the [[moth]] ''[[Samia cynthia]]'', which produces [[silk]] that is stronger and cheaper than [[mulberry]] silk, although with inferior gloss and texture.

The tree tends to be short-lived and the trunk soon becomes hollow, so a tree over two feet in diameter may fall in a strong wind.  The pale yellow, close-grained, satiny wood has been used in cabinet work.<ref name=Keeler />
There are records of the wood from this tree being used in China. There are problems with using the wood: because the trees exhibit extremely rapid growth for the first few years, the trunk has uneven texture between the inner wood and outer wood, which can cause the wood to twist and/or crack when it is dried after it is cut. Techniques have been developed for drying the wood so as to prevent this cracking, allowing the wood to be commercially harvested. Although the live tree tends to have very flexible wood, the wood is quite hard once properly dried.

===Medicinal uses===
It has uses in [[Chinese traditional medicine]]. The bark is used to treat [[dysentery]] and other [[bowel]] ailments. A tincture of the root-bark has been used successfully in cardiac palpitation, [[asthma]] and [[epilepsy]].

[[Synonymy|Synonyms]] of ''A. altissima'' include ''A. giraldii'' and ''A. glandulosa''; under the latter name, an extract of the bark is sometimes touted as an herbal homeopathic remedy for various ailments. However, taken in large doses, the bark extract is highly toxic.

==Culture & Literature==
The book ''[[A Tree Grows in Brooklyn]]'' by [[Betty Smith]] referred to the Tree of Heaven, using it as an analogy for the ability to thrive in a difficult environment. Ailanthus is also sometimes counter-[[nickname]]d "Tree from Hell", from its prolific [[Invasive plants|invasiveness]]. In cities, it often bears the name "Ghetto Palm", because of its propensity for growing in urban areas, on abandoned or poorly maintained properties.  It is particularly vigorous in parking lots, growing through and around chain link fences.

One of the Chinese names for this tree contains the descriptive word "stinky" (臭椿).

In some parts of China, unwanted or worthless children may be contemptuously called "ailanthus shoots" [http://www.invasive.org/eastern/eppc/ailanthus.html].
