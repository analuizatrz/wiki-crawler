==Geography and administration==
===Physical geography===
Manchester lies in a bowl-shaped land area bordered to the north and east by the [[Pennines|Pennine hills]] and to the south by the [[Cheshire]] Plain. The city centre is on the east bank of the [[River Irwell]], near the confluence of the [[River Medlock]] and the [[River Irk]] and is relatively low-lying, being between 35 and 42 [[metre]]s (115 to 138 [[Foot (unit of length)|ft]]) above [[sea level]]. The [[River Mersey]] flows through the south of Manchester. Much of the inner city, especially in the south, is flat, offering extensive views of the moors from the top floors of many high buildings. Manchester's geographic features were highly influential in its early development as the world's first industrial city. These features are its climate, its proximity to a [[port|seaport]] at [[Liverpool]], the availability of water power from its rivers, and its nearby [[coal]] reserves. 

===Climate===
Manchester has a relatively damp climate and a reputation as a rainy city. The average annual rainfall is 809&nbsp;mm, (902&nbsp;mm from some sources)<ref>[http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=043330&refer= Manchester, England], www.weatherbase.com. URL accessed October 25, 2006.</ref>meaning that its reputation is relatively undeserved.<ref>{{cite web | title=Manchester tourist guide — Geography & weather| work=Manchester Online | url=http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/tourist/geographyandweather/s/63/63975_sunshine_and_rain.html | accessdate=November 2 | accessyear=2005}}</ref> For example, this total is less than that of [[Plymouth]], [[Cardiff]] or [[Glasgow]]. In international terms, Manchester receives substantially less rain than [[New York City]], which receives 1200 mm of rain in an average year, and its average annual rainfall total is comparable with that of [[Rome]]. The precipitation is regularly light and prolonged, however, so a small volume of rain may take an hour to fall in Manchester, compared to several minutes of heavy rain experienced in Rome. Manchester also has a relatively high humidity level, which lent itself to the optimised and breakage-free textile manufacturing which took place in the city. Snowfall is rare in the city itself, being low-lying, towards the west coast and an urban landscape.

===Civic History===
The town of Manchester (as it was then) was granted a charter in 1301 by Thomas de Grelley, Baron of Manchester, who was also the [[Lord of the Manor]] of Manchester.<ref name=gmcro>[http://www.gmcro.co.uk/guides/gazette/gazframe.htm Greater Manchester Record Office] (Gazetteer Index - select M for Manchester).</ref>

[[Image:Manchester parish map.svg|thumb|250px|right|Map of the [[Manchester (ancient parish)|ancient parish of Manchester]].]]
Until the 19th century, Manchester was one of the many [[Township (England)|township]]s in the [[Manchester (ancient parish)|ancient parish of Manchester]] which covered a wider area than today's metropolitan borough. 

In 1792 commissioners, usually known as police commissioners, were established for the improvement of the [[Township (England)|township]] of Manchester. By the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], the [[Borough]] of Manchester was established  in 1838 as a local authority, which included the areas of Manchester, [[Bradford-with-Beswick|Beswick]], [[Cheetham]], [[Chorlton-on-Medlock]] and [[Hulme]] townships.<ref name=gmcro>[http://www.gmcro.co.uk/guides/gazette/gazframe.htm Greater Manchester Record Office] (Gazetteer Index - select M for Manchester).</ref>

On December 11, 1840, the Manchester [[Poor Law Union]] was formally declared and took responsibility for the administration and funding of the [[Poor Law]] in the area.<ref name=mancplu>[http://www.workhouses.org.uk/index.html?Manchester/Manchester.shtml Manchester Poor Union] (www.workhouses.org.uk).</ref> 

In 1853 the Borough was elevated to [[city status in the United Kingdom|City]] status. In 1885 further areas were added to the City of Manchester with [[Bradford-with-Beswick|Bradford]], [[Harpurhey]], [[Rusholme]] and parts of [[Moss Side]] and [[Withington]] townships. By the [[Local Government Act 1888]], the City of Manchester became in 1889 a [[County Borough]], although it still kept the city title.<ref name=gmcro>[http://www.gmcro.co.uk/guides/gazette/gazframe.htm Greater Manchester Record Office] (Gazetteer Index - select M for Manchester).</ref>

Other areas, which had been under the control of [[Lancashire County Council]], were added to the City between 1890 and 1933: 
* 1890 [[Blackley]], [[Crumpsall]], [[Moston, Greater Manchester|Moston]], [[Openshaw]] and [[Newton Heath|Newton]] (incl. Kirkmanshulme) townships, [[Clayton, Greater Manchester|Clayton]] area (part of [[Droylsden]] township) and part of [[Gorton]] township. 
* 1901 A very small part of [[Gorton]] Urban District. 
* 1903 Part ([[Heaton Park]] area) of [[Prestwich]] Urban District. 
* 1904 [[Burnage]], [[Didsbury]] and [[Chorlton cum Hardy]] civil parishes and [[Moss Side]] and [[Withington]] Urban Districts. 
* 1909 [[Levenshulme]] Urban District and the remaining area of [[Gorton]] Urban District. 
* 1913 Part of [[Heaton Norris]] Urban District.
* 1933 Part of [[Denton]] Urban District. 
* In addition to these areas, in 1931 the [[Cheshire]] civil parishes of [[Baguley]], [[Northenden]] and [[Northern Etchells]] were also added to the City of Manchester.<ref name=gmcro>[http://www.gmcro.co.uk/guides/gazette/gazframe.htm Greater Manchester Record Office] (Gazetteer Index - select M for Manchester).</ref>

In 1974, under the [[Local Government Act 1972]], the City of Manchester, with the addition of the civil parish of [[Ringway]], became one of the ten [[Metropolitan Borough]]s of the (then newly created) [[Metropolitan county|Metropolitan County]] of [[Greater Manchester]].

[[Greater Manchester County Council]] was abolished in 1986 by the [[Local Government Act 1985]] and most of its functions were devolved to the ten boroughs, making them to a large extent [[unitary authority|unitary authorities]].  Some of its functions were taken over by joint bodies such as [[Passenger Transport Executive|Passenger Transport Authorities]], and joint fire, police and waste disposal authorities.

The [[M postal area]] has three separate [[post town]]s, Manchester, [[Salford]] and [[Sale, Greater Manchester|Sale]]. The [[M postal area]] borders the postal areas of [[BL postal area|BL]] (Bolton), [[OL postal area|OL]] (Oldham), [[SK postal area|SK]] (Stockport), [[WA postal area|WA]] (Warrington) and [[WN postal area|WN]] (Wigan).

==Etymology==
The name "Manchester" came from the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] name ''Mamucium'', thought to be a [[Latin]]isation of an original [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] name (possibly meaning "breast-like hill" from ''mamm-'' = "[[breast]]"), plus [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] ''ceaster'' = "[[town]]", which is derived from [[Latin]] ''[[castra]]'' = "camp". <ref>{{cite book|author=Mills, A. D.|title=A Dictionary of British Place-names|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn= ISBN 0-19-852758-6}}</ref>

==History==
{{main|History of Manchester}}
===Early history===
[[Image:Peterloo carlile.JPG|thumb|250px|right|The [[Peterloo massacre]].]]
The Manchester area was settled in or before [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times.<ref>Rogers, Nicholas - ''Halloween: from Pagan Ritual to Party Night'', 2003, [[Oxford University Press]], ISBN 0-1951-6896-8? P.18 </ref> The original fort was constructed by General [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]] as a staging post between [[Chester]] (''Deva'') and York (''Eboracum''). This Roman settlement was named ''Mamucium'' ([[Celtic languages|Celtic]] for "[[breast]]-shaped hill") after the hill that it was sited on to be better defensible. The original location of the fort is now in the City of [[Salford]]. 

The fort was abandoned in the [[Dark Ages]], and at some point in time the focus of settlement shifted from this spot to the confluence of the rivers [[River Irwell|Irwell]] and [[Irk]].

In medieval times, this area included a fortified manor house. Thomas De La Warre, a manorial lord who also happened to be a priest, gave the site to the church for use as a College of Priests around 1422, and commenced the construction of the Collegiate Church. The former is now [[Chetham's School of Music]], and the latter [[Manchester Cathedral]].

Around the 13th century, Manchester grew heavily due to an influx of [[Flemish]] settlers who founded Manchester's new cotton industry{{fact}} and sparked the growth of the city to become [[Lancashire]]'s major industrial centre.  

===Industrial Revolution===
[[Image:Cottonopolis1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Manchester (or [[Cottonopolis]] as it was sometimes referred) during the early 19th century.]]
In the late 18th cenury, Manchester was the destination of England's first "pure canal" when James Brindley built the Bridgewater canal to bring coal from the eponymous Duke's mines at Worsley.  During the [[19th Century]] Manchester grew to become to the centre of [[Lancashire]]'s cotton industry and was dubbed "[[Cottonopolis]]". During this period Manchester the canal system grew, and Manchester became one end of the world's first passenger railway - the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]].

Manchester quickly grew into the most important industrial centre in the world, and, significantly, the first industrial society. The pace of change was fast and frightening. At that time, it seemed a place in which anything could happen &mdash; new industrial processes, new ways of thinking (the so called 'Manchester School', promoting [[free trade]] and ''[[laissez-faire]]''), new classes or groups in society, new religious sects, and new forms of labour organisation. It attracted educated visitors from all parts of Britain and Europe. "What Manchester does today," it was said, "the rest of the world does tomorrow." Also during this period Manchester saw a rise in its population as Lancastarians, the Irish, Jews and many other people immigrated to the city.

As well as being a centre of capitalism the city saw its fair share of rebellion by the working and non-titled classes, with the most famous being the events on St Peter’s Field on [[16 August]] [[1819]] which have become known as '[[Peterloo]]'. The first [[Trades Union Congress]] was held in Manchester (at the Mechanics' Institute, David Street), from [[2 June|2]] to [[6 June]] 1868. Manchester was the subject of [[Friedrich Engels]]' ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'', Engels himself spending much of his life in and around Manchester. Manchester was also an important cradle of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and the [[Suffragette]] Movement.

Manchester's golden age was perhaps the last quarter of the nineteenth century. Many of the great public buildings (including the Town Hall) date from then. The city's cosmopolitan atmosphere contributed to a vibrant culture, which included the [[Hallé Orchestra]]. In 1889, when county councils were created in [[England]], the municipal borough became a [[county borough]] with even greater autonomy. During this period, the [[Manchester Ship Canal]] was created by the canalisation of the  Rivers Irwell and Mersey for 36 miles from Salford to the Mersey estuary at the port of Liverpool. This enabled ocean going ships to sail right into the Salford docks. The docks functioned up until the 1970s, with their closure leading to a large increase in unemployment in the area.

[[Image:Albert-Square-Manchester.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Albert Square]]

[[Trafford Park]] in Stretford was the world's first industrial estate and still exists today, though with a significant tourist and recreational presence. Manchester suffered greatly from the inter-war depression and the underlying structural changes that began to supplant the old industries, including textile manufacture.

===Recent history===
During [[World War II]], Manchester was involved in heavy industrial construction &mdash; it was home to [[Avro]] (now [[BAE Systems]]) which built countless aircraft for the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], the most famous being the [[Avro Lancaster]] bomber. The city was attacked a number of times by the [[Luftwaffe]], particularly in the "Christmas Blitz" of 1941, which destroyed a large part of the historic city centre and seriously damaged the Cathedral.

In 2002, the city successfully hosted the [[2002 Commonwealth Games|XVII Commonwealth Games]], earning praise from many sources. Manchester has twice failed in its bid to host the [[Olympic Games]], losing to [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] in 1996 and [[Sydney]] in 2000.

Rapidly developing institutions attract [[crime]] and disorder; see main article [[crime and policing in Manchester]].

===Bombing===
{{main|1996 Manchester bombing}}
[[Image:Manchesterbomb-devestation.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The devastation left by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] [[1996 Manchester bombing|bombing]]]]
[[Image:Manchester Exchange Squares.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Manchester's [[Exchange Square (Manchester)|Exchange Square]] undergoing extensive regeneration.]]
At 11.20 am on Saturday [[15 June]] [[1996]], the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] detonated a large [[1996 Manchester bombing|bomb in the city centre]], the largest to be detonated on British soil. Whilst this bomb caused over 200 injuries, it caused no deaths, and the principal damage was to the physical infrastructure of nearby buildings. The consequent reconstruction spurred a massive regeneration of the city centre, with complexes such as [[The Printworks]] and the Triangle creating new city focal points for both shopping and entertainment. The regeneration took over a decade to complete. The latest and final part of the renovated [[Manchester Arndale]] opened in September 2006, allowing the centre to hold the title of Europe's largest city centre shopping mall.

===Redevelopment===
Since the regeneration after the 1996 IRA bomb, and aided by the [[2002 Commonwealth Games|XVII Commonwealth Games]], Manchester's city centre has changed significantly. Large sections of the city dating from the 1960s have been either demolished and re-developed or modernised with the use of glass and steel; a good example of this transformation is the [[Manchester Arndale]]. Many old mills have been converted into apartments, helping to give the city a much more modern, upmarket look and feel. Some areas, like [[Hulme]], have undergone extensive regeneration programmes and many million-pound lofthouse apartments have since been developed to cater for its growing business community. The 168 metre tall, 47-storey [[Beetham Tower, Manchester|Beetham Tower]], completed in 2006, provides the highest residential accommodation in the United Kingdom - the lower 23 floors form the Hilton Hotel, while the upper 24 floors are apartments. The [[Beetham Tower, Manchester|Beetham Tower]] was originally planned to stand 171 metres in height, but this had to be changed due to local wind conditions.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4944590.stm "City building reaches full height"], BBC, [[26 April]] [[2006]], retrieved [[2 May]] [[2006]].</ref>

==Politics==
{{main|Politics in Manchester}}

==Economics==
[[Image:CIS Tower.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[CIS Tower]] is one of the many company Headquarters in the city]]
Manchester has many office buildings, and its [[Central Business District]] is currently in the centre of the city, adjacent to Piccadilly, focused on Mosley Street, Deansgate, King Street and Piccadilly. However, new office space is appearing rapidly throughout the city, as its reputation as a high quality European Business Centre increases. [[Spinningfields]] is a large new development west of Deansgate; it will be a large, modern business centre, and home to several headquarters, squares, and cafes. The first building on the site was the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]]'s new headquarters on Deansgate. The project is being spear-headed by [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Sir Norman Foster]]. Other buildings include a 110 metre tall office building, a new justice centre and new [[Crown Court]], to be built over the next few years. 

Just outside the city centre, a new business district is appearing in [[Salford Quays]], regenerated ex-shipping docks similar to London's [[London Docklands|Docklands]], and is home to headquarters and [[call centres]] for many major companies. The announcement in June 2006 that the [[BBC]] hopes to relocate several departments to the Quays from London is sure to further expand the area as Greater Manchester's second major [[Business district]].

===Shopping===
Manchester is a major retail centre. It has two large [[shopping malls]]; the [[Manchester Arndale]] in the middle of the city and the out-of-town [[Trafford Centre]]. The city centre has a number of smaller shopping centres, including [[Corn Exchange, Manchester|The Triangle]], which caters for a more youthful and upmarket clientele and the [[Royal Exchange, Manchester|Royal Exchange Centre]]. Manchester also has one of the largest [[ASDA|ASDA-WalMart]] supercentres in the UK, close to the [[City of Manchester Stadium]] in Eastlands. 

[[Image:Market St From Foodchain.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Manchester's Main Shopping District; Market Street]]

In the central shopping area of the city centre, road access is all but impossible, making journeys around the city on foot quicker, safer and more convenient.  The pedestrianised [[Market Street (Manchester, England)|Market Street]] forms the core of the city centre's retail area.  It is dominated on the north side by the Manchester Arndale and a branch of [[Debenhams]]. 

The Shambles contains a branch of [[Harvey Nichols]], a [[Marks and Spencer]] store, and a branch of [[Selfridges]], as well as a variety of upmarket designer [[boutiques]].  

[[Deansgate]] also has many shops, including the department store [[House of Fraser]] (formerly Kendals), along with [[pub]]s and bars. [[King Street, Manchester|King Street]] is an affluent shopping area where many exclusive fashion brands have stores. King Street also has many notable buildings preserved in a conservation area. Other hubs in the centre include St Ann's Square, and [[Exchange Square (Manchester)|Exchange Square]].  

Former stores, since gone, include [[Lewis's]], Henry's, and Affleck and Brown. The building that housed Affleck and Brown is now known as [[Affleck's Palace]]. It consists of low-cost stalls for independent traders and creatives. Affleck's is on [[Oldham Street]], in the [[Northern Quarter]], along with a range of independent music, clothing, and other shops.

===Food and drink===
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Theprintworks.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Manchester's [[The Printworks|Printworks]] , a major food and drink site in the centre of the city {{speedy-image-c|[[2006-11-18]]}}]] -->
Manchester has a range of restaurants, bars, and clubs, spanning the famous "curry mile" in [[Rusholme]] to traditional ‘grub’, [[Chinatown]], modern bars and bistros at Deansgate Locks in the city centre. There are now many top class restaurants.

There is a [[Hard Rock Cafe]], chain restaurants such as [[Wagamama]] and bars that include Waxy O’Connors and The Living Room. The coffee chain [[Starbucks]] has 12 outlets in a 2 mile radius. Other, independent restaurants, bars and clubs can be found in the [[Northern Quarter]] area of the city centre.

Manchester is also famous for its beer, despite the closure of the [[Boddingtons]] brewery in 2005. [[Keg]] 'Boddies' is brewed by Interbrew in Luton but [[cask]] Boddington's continues to be brewed in the city by [[Hydes]] brewery in [[Moss Side]]. Hydes is a long established independent brewery. Another Manchester brewer is [[Joseph Holts (brewery)|Joseph Holt]], whose Derby Brewery in [[Cheetham]] is just round the corner from the defunct Boddingtons Strangeways brewery. The Royal Brewery in Moss Side — not far from Hyde's — brews [[McEwan's]] lager. [[J W Lees]] brewery is in [[Middleton Junction]], a few miles north of the city. There are also a notable number of [[microbreweries]] producing smaller quantities of high quality [[beer]], [[cider]] and [[perry]].

Breweries in Manchester and Salford which closed within the last twenty years include [[Wilson's]], whose [[Newton Heath]] brewery closed in the late 1980s, and [[Whitbread/Chester's]] in Salford.

==Demographics==
The [[United Kingdom Census 2001]] showed a total population for Manchester of 392,819, a 9.2% decline on the figure from the previous census, ten years before.<ref>[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/profiles/00BN-A.asp Manchester], www.statistics.gov.uk, National Statistics. http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/profiles/00BN-A.asp Manchester], www.statistics.gov.uk, National Statistics.

75.9% of Manchester's population claim they have been born in the [[UK]], according to the [[2001 UK Census]].

Inhabitants of Manchester are known as ''Mancunians''.

===Ethnicity===
81% of people identified themselves as "White", 5.9% as "[[Indian]]" or "[[Pakistan|Pakistani]]",  2.3% as "Black [[Caribbean]]" and 1.4% as "Black African".<ref>[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/profiles/00BN-A.asp Manchester], www.statistics.gov.uk, National Statistics.

===Economic activity===
Manchester reported the second-lowest proportion of the population in employment of any area in the United Kingdom. Although unemployment in Manchester is higher than average, the primary reason for Manchester's low level of employed people is the very high proportion of the population who are students.<ref>[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/profiles/00BN-A.asp Manchester], www.statistics.gov.uk, National Statistics. URL accessed October 25, 2006.</ref>

==Education==
===Universities===
Manchester is home to two major [[University|universities]] - the [[University of Manchester]] and [[Manchester Metropolitan University]]  - which are both located to the south of the city centre. The University of Manchester is the largest full-time non-collegiate university in the United Kingdom, and was created in autumn 2004 by the merger of [[Victoria University of Manchester]] and [[UMIST]]. Manchester Metropolitan University was formed out of the old [[Polytechnic#United Kingdom|polytechnic college]] in the city.

The [[University of Manchester]], [[Manchester Metropolitan University]] and the [[Royal Northern College of Music]] are all grouped together on the southern side of the city centre, and effectively form one large campus along and near to Oxford Road (with the exception of the North Campus of the [[University of Manchester]], which was the [[UMIST]] campus before the merger). [[Manchester Business School]], which offered the first MBA course in the UK in 1965, forms a part of the University of Manchester.

===Schools===
Manchester's most notable secondary school is the [[Manchester Grammar School]], an independent (what would be termed "private" in other English-speaking countries) boys' school, for pupils aged 11–18, in [[Fallowfield]], South Manchester. In the post-war period, it was a direct-grant [[grammar school]], which charged no fees, but it became an independent school in 1976 after the Labour government removed funding from direct-grant grammar schools. Originally situated in the centre of the city, in a prominent position close to the Cathedral, it has since relocated to Old Hall Lane in Fallowfield, to accommodate the growing student body. Its previous premises are now used by [[Chetham's School of Music]]. The Metropolitan Borough of Trafford in Manchester still operates the state grammar school (11+) system and therefore has a large number of high attaining schools in the state school sector. Altrincham Grammar School for Boys (state school) is among these, rated as the top boy's school in the North of England, based upon the 2006 A-level results. The school has a number of links with Altrincham Grammar School for Girls.

==Religion==
[[Image:StAnnesChurch, Manchester (2002).jpg|thumb|left|St Ann's Church, St Ann's Square]]
The [[Anglican Diocese of Manchester]] was established in 1847.
Manchester has also has an [[Anglican]] [[Manchester Cathedral|cathedral]], St Mary, St George's and St Denys' Cathedral. It was built over a period of 600 years and is built in the Gothic Style.

Manchester lies within the [[Roman Catholic]] '''[[Diocese of Salford]]'''. The oldest surviving Catholic church is [[The Hidden Gem|St Mary's The Hidden Gem]], on Mulberry Street in the city centre. Manchester is in the Central North Division of the [[Salvation Army]]. 

Manchester has a large [[Muslim]] population, and the UK's largest [[Jew]]ish community outside London.

===Architecture===
Manchester has a wide variety of buildings mainly from [[Victorian architecture]] through to modern. Much of the architecture in the city harks back to its former days as a global centre for the [[cotton]] trade. Many warehouses have now been converted for other uses but the external appearance remains mostly unchanged so the city keeps much of its original character. An interesting facet of the architecture of Manchester and several other cities which underwent a construction boom during the industrial revolution is that inspiration was taken from [[Venice]]. Examples of this architecture can be easily found to the south and east of Albert Square and near the 92nd lock of the [[Bridgewater Canal]], near Beetham Tower.

Manchester also has a number of [[skyscrapers]].  Most were built during the sixties and seventies.  However, in the last few years there has been a renewed interest in building [[Tallest Buildings of Manchester|skyscrapers in Manchester]].  Numerous residential and office blocks are being built or have recently been built in the city centre. [[Beetham Tower, Manchester|Beetham Tower]] was completed in the Autumn of 2006 and houses a Hilton hotel along with a restaurant and residential properties.  It is currently the tallest building in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] outside London.  However, this status may be short lived, an even taller building, the [[Inacity Tower]], is scheduled to commence construction in [[2007]] behind [[Manchester Piccadilly station]].

===Public monuments===
[[Image:Piccadilly Gardens, Manchester.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Piccadilly Gardens]]]]
Within Manchester there are monuments to numerous people and events that have helped to shape the city and influence the wider community.  There are two large squares that hold many of Manchester's public monuments. There is [[Albert Square, Manchester|Albert Square]] in front of the [[Manchester Town Hall|Town Hall]] which has monuments to [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Prince Albert]], [[James Fraser (bishop)|Bishop James Fraser]], [[Oliver Heywood]], [[William Ewart Gladstone]] and [[John Bright]] , and [[Piccadilly Gardens]] which has monuments dedicated to [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], [[Robert Peel]], [[James Watt]] and The [[Duke of Wellington]].

Notable monuments elsewhere in the city include the [[Alan Turing Memorial]] situated in Sackville Park close to [[Canal Street, Manchester|Canal street]] remembers the father of modern computing.  A monument to [[Abraham Lincoln]] in Lincoln Square marks the [[cotton famine]] of 1861–1865.  Finally, the success of the 2002 Commonwealth Games is commemorated by ''[[B of the Bang]]'', Britain’s tallest sculpture, located near the City of Manchester Stadium.

===Streets and plazas===
{{Seealso|Category:Streets and squares in Manchester}}
Manchester has a number of busy squares, plazas and shopping streets. Many of Manchester city centre's streets are now pedestrianised with numerous other streets having [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]] or Bus priority, this makes driving around Manchester City Centre complicated.  

One of the oldest thoroughfares is [[Market Street (Manchester, England)|Market Street]]. This was originally called ''Market Stede Lane''. Much of the [[medieval]] street pattern, around the original Market Place was cleared as part of 1970s developments. Ancient streets such as Smithy Door were lost forever. One ancient street to survive is Long Millgate, which led north from the old Market Place. This winding lane, crossing Fennel Street and leading on to Todd Street (formerly Toad Lane - thought to be a corruption of T'owd Lane - The Old Lane) is now an attractive and peaceful thoroughfare, bounded by gardens.

Whitworth Street is a broad [[19th century]] route, stretching from [[Deansgate]] to London Road, running parallel to the [[Rochdale Canal]] for much of its route, and intersecting with Princess Street, Chepstow Street and Albion Street along the way. 
The street is bounded by impressive brick buildings, formerly warehouses, but now mostly residential developments.

Mosley Street runs roughly parallel to Portland Street, Whitworth Street and Deansgate, leading from Piccadilly Gardens to [[St Peter's Square, Manchester|St Peter's Square]]. The street is closed to general traffic, with the [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]] running trams along its route.

Another [[Victorian era|Victorian]] addition to the city's street pattern was Corporation Street, which cut through slums to the north of Market Street and provided a direct link from Cross Street (and the newly constructed [[Albert Square, Manchester|Albert Square]]) to the routes north of the city. 

To the south of the city centre, [[Wilmslow Road]] is the hub of much student life and is home to Manchester’s [[curry mile]]. 

Other notable places in Manchester include:
*Great Northern Square
*Spring Gardens
*[[Cathedral Gardens]]
*New Cathedral Street
*The Gay Village
*Chinatown

==Transport and infrastructure==

{{tone}}

Manchester is very well served in terms of transport and infrastructure. The roads of Manchester are some of the most extensive in the UK and statistically [[Greater Manchester]] has a higher percentage of the motorway network than any other county in the country. {{fact}} According to The Guinness Book of World Records, it has the most traffic lanes side by side (17), spread across several parallel carriageways. ([[M61]] at Linnyshaw Moss, Greater Manchester, close to the [[M60]] interchange). 

There are high sales of air tickets to international and national destinations with most travelling from [[Manchester Airport]].  The [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] was the first passenger railway in the world.  Today, Greater Manchester still has an extensive citywide railway network, and two mainline stations.

Other forms of [[transport]] in Manchester are the famous [[Hackney carriage|Black Cabs]] which are reasonably priced compared to other cities and there are plenty of [[taxi stand]]s. You can also call for a minicab direct to your location, with many firms providing this service. The biggest in Manchester is Street Cars, which is also the name of the [[taxicab]] firm in ''[[Coronation Street]]''.

===Air===
[[Image:Ringway-t2.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Terminal 2 at [[Manchester Airport]]]]
[[Manchester Airport]], formerly Manchester Ringway Airport, is the fourth busiest airport in the UK in terms of passengers per year. The busier airports are London's Heathrow, Gatwick and (from 2006) Stansted. It is served by [[Manchester Airport railway station|a dedicated railway station]]. In 2006 the airport handled 22.1 million passengers and provided direct flights to over 180 destinations worldwide by over 90 airlines. Long haul scheduled destinations served directly from Manchester include [[New York]] ( [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|JFK]] and [[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark]]), [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago]], [[Logan International Airport|Boston]], [[Philadelphia International Airport|Philadelphia]], [[Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Atlanta]], [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Miami]], [[Houston]], [[Las Vegas]], [[Toronto Pearson International Airport|Toronto]], [[Calgary]], [[Vancouver]],[[Port of Spain]], [[Antigua]], [[Barbados]].  Asian destinations include [[Damascus]], [[Dubai]], [[Abu Dhabi]], [[Doha]], [[Tehran]], [[Karachi]], [[Islamabad]], [[Lahore]], and [[Singapore]]. There are also firm plans for direct services to [[Beijing]] and [[Bangkok]]. Many European and domestic destinations are served. Manchester to London is one of the highest density airline routes within the UK and is one of the busiest domestic sectors in Europe, but is now experiencing serious competition from the improved railway links.  

The airport has been voted the best airport in the UK by [[Which]] Consumer Magazine, Travel Weekly Globe, Business Magazines International for the second year running and in the Airport World’s Service Excellence Awards (European runner up, second only to [[Copenhagen]]).

[[Barton Aerodrome]], one of the world's oldest airports, opened in 1930 and still in operation. It is a very busy light aviation airfield with small grass runways which deal with light aircraft. It also has the world's oldest operating aircraft control tower, completed in 1933.

The first airfields in the Manchester area were at [[Trafford Park]] (1911-1918), followed by [[Alexandra Park Aerodrome]] (1918-1924).  

[[Image:A57(M) Manchester.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[A57(M) motorway|A57(M)]] running south of the city centre.]]

===Road===
Manchester, like [[London]], has an outer [[ring road]]: the [[M60 motorway|M60]]. Unlike London's [[M25 motorway|M25]], the M60 actually runs within the Greater Manchester conurbation providing good links, rather than around the conurbation as the M25 does. It has 27 junctions, numbered consecutively clockwise, starting with Junction 1 at [[Stockport]] in the south-east of the conurbation. The second busiest section of road in the UK, after a section of the M25 (junctions 13 & 14 [[Heathrow]]), is the [[M60]] stretch to the north-west of Manchester city centre between junction 16 ([[Pendlebury]]/[[Kearsley]]) and junction 17 ([[Prestwich]]/[[Whitefield, Greater Manchester|Whitefield]]).

The city also has an inner ring road. Part of this is the A57/[[A57(M) motorway|A57(M)]] (also known as ''Mancunian Way''), which runs south of the city centre, linking the western [[M602 motorway|M602]] (which spurs from the M60) to the eastern M60 and [[M67 motorway|M67]].

The other main motorways serving Manchester are the [[M56 motorway|M56]] (to the [[Manchester Airport|airport]], [[Chester]] and the [[M6 motorway|M6]] southbound to [[Birmingham]]), the [[M61 motorway|M61]] (to [[Bolton]], [[Preston]] and the [[M6 motorway|M6]] northbound to [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]]), the [[M62 motorway|M62]] (to [[Liverpool]], [[Leeds]] and [[Kingston upon Hull]]), the [[M66 motorway|M66]] (to [[Bury]]) and the M67, which was originally built as a route to [[Sheffield]] but was cancelled long before completion. All of these [[motorway]]s connect onto the M60.

[[Image:Manchester Piccadilly.squiddly.jpg|thumb|300px|A view from inside Manchester's busiest railway station, [[Manchester Piccadilly station|Piccadilly]].]]

===Rail===
Manchester holds a pivotal position in [[railway]] history as a birthplace of passenger rail travel on the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]], which opened in 1830 after the famous [[Rainhill Trials]] chose [[Stephenson's Rocket]] to pull the trains. In just 50 years the city centre was encircled by stations and termini, including [[Manchester London Road Station]], (now [[Manchester Piccadilly]]), [[Manchester Victoria]], [[Manchester Central Railway Station]], [[Manchester Mayfield Station]] and [[Manchester Exchange railway station|Manchester Exchange Station]]. Following the [[Beeching Report]] in the 1960s, cutbacks followed, with [[Manchester Central Railway Station|Manchester Central]], [[Manchester Mayfield Station|Manchester Mayfield]] and [[Manchester Exchange Station|Manchester Exchange]] closing to passengers. All rail services were then directed to [[Manchester Victoria]] and [[Manchester Piccadilly]]. High speed trains to [[London]] are run from Manchester Piccadilly by [[Virgin Trains]], journeys typically taking around 2 hr 15 min. There are also several smaller stations remaining around the [[Manchester City Centre|City Centre]], including [[Manchester Oxford Road station]], [[Deansgate railway station]] and [[Salford Central railway station]].

Although there is no [[Underground Railway]] system similar to Glasgow's or London's, the city has had several failed attempts to create one including the infamous "[[Picc-Vic tunnel]]", a heavy rail tunnel linking the main stations. Excavation work under the [[Manchester Arndale]] for this project began in the 1970s, but was soon abandoned due to costs and rumours of 'subterranean obstacles'. This may well have referred to the '[http://www.cybertrn.demon.co.uk/guardian/ Guardian]' underground nuclear bunker network, originally constructed by as a means of protecting communications in the city in the event of an atom bomb being deployed and now used by [[BT]]. Piccadilly and Victoria are now linked by the city's Metrolink tram system.

The urban and suburban areas are covered by a sizeable [http://nationalrail.co.uk/system/galleries/download/print_maps/liverpool.pdf network of rail lines], including lines to [[Ashton-under-Lyne]], [[Bolton]], [[Oldham]], [[Stockport]] and [[Wilmslow]]. Full timetables can be found at [http://www.thetrainline.com/default.asp?T2ID=6847_2007111163857.htm the Trainline]

===Metrolink=== 
[[Image:manchestertram 500.jpg|thumb|300px|A [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]] tram in Manchester city centre.]]
{{main|Manchester Metrolink}}

Manchester has a [[tram]] system called [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]]. Operated by [[Serco]] (which also runs [[London]]'s "[[Docklands Light Railway]]"), the Metrolink links the city centre to [[Altrincham]], [[Eccles, Greater Manchester|Eccles]] and [[Bury]]. It is a high-frequency service, with trams running every 6–12 minutes. It carries nearly 20 million passengers each year.

Proposals for a light-rail system in the city grew from a [[1970]]'s proposal by [[SELNEC]] to build three urban rapid transit lines in the [[conurbation]].

Plans to extend [[Manchester Metrolink]] were reinstated after an election-time [[U-turn (politics)|u-turn]] by the Labour Government which had previously rejected the plans months earlier, despite years of support. The Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive ([[Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive|GMPTE]]), responsible for public transport in the area, led the fight to ensure that the extensions are to be built, with significant support from Local Councils and Communities, as well as the main [[Manchester City Council]].<ref>"[http://www.manchester.gov.uk/corporate/metrolink/ Get our Metrolink back on track]", Manchester City Council, [[25 November]] [[2005]]; Retrieved [[14 May]] [[2006]].</ref> In July 2006 the government announced a major extension to the Metrolink system which is intended to form the first phase of the eventual so-called 'big bang' expansion.  If the eventual desired system is completed, passenger numbers are predicted to more than double to an estimated 50 million per year.

A widely held view of many in Manchester of one of the major failings of the Metrolink is that it has never been extended to reach the [[Trafford Centre]] (approx. 5 miles away in Trafford Park), with a wide possibility of routes for this task. The line from Manchester City Centre to [[Eccles, Greater Manchester|Eccles]] Town Centre is also judged by many to be a failure as it takes longer than an equivalent [[bus]] journey following a similar route, but achieves this without the Metrolink's advantage of using 'Metrolink-only' specially dedicated / constructed routes.{{fact}}

Since Metrolink's inception and the initial euphoria at the huge success, by the public / local & national government / environmental groups it has become something of a victim of its own popularity. Many routes are extremely busy, especially at [[Rush hour|peak times]], and prices have risen at a rate far above that of [[inflation]].

===Buses===
Manchester and the surrounding area have an extensive bus network, with regular services in and out of the city connecting to all the satellite towns and villages. Maps of bus routes and a public transport journey planner for the Greater Manchester can be found on the [http://www.gmpte.com GMPTE website].

The city’s buses are operated by a range of companies including [[First Group|First]], [[Stagecoach Group|Stagecoach]] (incorporating the lower-cost [[Magicbus]]), [[East Yorkshire Motor Services|Finglands]], [[Arriva North-West & Wales|Arriva]] and R. Bullock. Until [[22 December]] [[2006]], when their services were suspended by the North-west Traffic Commissioner[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/6204717.stm], UK North (also trading as GM Buses) also operated buses in Manchester. The major routes, with high passenger volumes, are well provided-for. These include Oxford Road/[[Wilmslow Road]], one of the busiest bus routes in Europe, bringing large numbers of students & commuters from [[Fallowfield]] / [[Withington]] / [[Didsbury]] to the university buildings that have campuses scattered around the city centre, and the various office buildings, including the [[BBC]]. Other routes that are not as commercially attractive, with smaller passenger volumes, are less well provided for, and the cost of a single journey can be similar to that of a Week Pass for the "South Manchester" journey.

First Manchester also operates free [[Metroshuttle]] services which link important areas of the city, such as [[Manchester Victoria]], [[Manchester Piccadilly|Piccadilly]] and [[Manchester Oxford Road station|Oxford Road]] stations with Chinatown, Deansgate, [[Salford Central railway station|Salford Central]], and Albert Square. These services are very successful and therefore often busy. At present, there are three routes, numbered 1, 2 and 3, and coloured orange, green and purple respectively. They run every 5-10 minutes and complement the Metrolink and National Rail services, linking them with the city’s car parks, tourist attractions and bus termini.

Those arriving at [[Manchester Piccadilly Bus Station]], and needing to take a [[train]] from [[Manchester Piccadilly]], can choose either a [[Metrolink]] or the free [[Metroshuttle]]. It should be noted, however, that if one sits waiting on the [[Metroshuttle]] for 10 minutes one could have easily walked the distance to the [[Manchester Piccadilly Railway Station]], less than half a mile away.

High frequency [[articulated bus|bendy bus]] routes include the [[Bury]]-Manchester 135 service and the [[Bolton]]-Manchester 8 service, which operate every ten minutes.

Manchester's principal bus station mainly for services on the south side of the city is at [[Piccadilly Gardens]], which is also served by [[Metrolink]] and a short walk from the city's main railway station, [[Manchester Piccadilly|Piccadilly]]. Shudehill Bus/Metrolink Interchange caters for routes mainly on the north side of the city and is within walking distance of the [[Manchester Victoria|Victoria station]]. Long-distance coaches, operated mainly by National Express, serve the Manchester Central Coach Station at Chorlton Street. This smart, modern station opened in March 2002 and replaced the old Chorlton Street coach station, on exactly the same site. The old station was notorious for crime and prostitution.

===Water===
[[Image:Bridgewater Canal Stockton Heath Warrington 01Aug04.JPG|200px|thumb|right|The [[Bridgewater Canal]].]]
One legacy of the industrial revolution is an extensive network of [[canal]]s: the [[Manchester, Bolton & Bury Canal]], [[Rochdale Canal]], [[Manchester Ship Canal]], which provides access to the sea, [[Bridgewater Canal]], [[Ashton Canal]], and the Leigh Branch of the [[Leeds & Liverpool Canal]]. Today, most of these canals are used for recreation.

The Manchester area is supplied with water by numerous artificial lakes, built on the former small rivers around the city. In some cases these lakes form long chains, as in [[Longdendale]].
In the past, the city also had a "pressurised water" power supply system, a predecessor of the modern electricity network. Manchester also had Britain's first sewer network, which still exists today. This network may be one of the factors that prevents Manchester from having an underground rail system.

==Culture==
===Nightlife===
There has long been a thriving [[nightclub]] culture in Manchester.  UK broadcaster [[Jimmy Savile]] is credited as becoming the first modern [[DJ]] by using twin turntables for continuous play after he obtained two domestic record decks welded together. He first used this device to play to the public in 1946, at a nightclub called The Ritz on Whitworth Street (which had opened in 1927). Tony Prince is credited as becoming the world's first full-time club DJ in 1964 when Savile, who was then a Mecca manager in Manchester, told him that [[Top Rank]] considered him to be the first person to be on their payroll as a pure DJ.

Many [[teenagers]] of the 1960s developed a love for [[Northern Soul]], which had as two of its epicentres the [[Wigan Casino]] and Manchester's [[Twisted Wheel Club]], and is credited as being instrumental in the development of the [[Motown Sound]].

[[Rob Gretton]], members of [[New Order]] (the band formed from the remaining members of [[Joy Division]] after singer [[Ian Curtis]]' suicide) and [[Factory Records]] boss [[Tony Wilson]] opened Fac 51 [[The Hacienda]] on Whitworth Street in 1982. It quickly became the focus of [[electronic music]] and the start of [[house music]], the [[Madchester]] sound, and the [[Ibiza]] scene, which all came together in the [[Second Summer of Love|Summer of Love]] in 1988. The Hacienda was also at the setting of the 2002 movie [[24 Hour Party People]].

Other historical clubs and nights in Manchester include
*"Naked under leather" &mdash; one of the UK birthplaces of [[Electronic Music]].
*"The Number One" &mdash; the first [[gay]] [[rave]]/house club.
*"Bowlers" &mdash; home of [[happy hardcore]].
*"Paradise Factory" and "The Breakfast Club" at Manto.
*"[[Jilly's Rockworld]]".
*"Home".
*"Flesh".
*"Homoelectric".
*"Danceteria".
*"[[The Hacienda]]"
*" Sankeys Soap"

One of the oldest and most diverse venues is the [[Band on the Wall]], a live music venue in the [[Northern Quarter]] area of the city. This venue was built around 1862 as the flagship pub of a local brewery; it was originally called The George & Dragon. It got its nickname in the late 1920s or early 1930s from the stage high on the back wall. In 1975 it was taken on by jazz musician Steve Morris and his business partner Frank Cusick, and renamed The Band on the Wall.

===Classical music===
Manchester is home to two [[symphony orchestra]]s, the [[Hallé Orchestra]] and the [[BBC Philharmonic Orchestra]]. There is also a [[chamber orchestra]], the [[Manchester Camerata]].

For many years the city’s main classical venue was the [[Free Trade Hall]] on Peter Street. Since 1996, however, Manchester has had a modern 2,500 seat concert venue called the [[Bridgewater Hall]], which is also home to the Hallé Orchestra. The hall is one of the country’s most technically advanced classical music and lecture venues, with an acoustically designed interior and suspended foundations for an optimum sound. Other venues for classical concerts include the [[Royal Northern College of Music|RNCM]], the [[Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester|Royal Exchange Theatre]] and [[Manchester Cathedral]].

Manchester is a centre for musical education, being home to the [[Royal Northern College of Music]] and [[Chetham's School of Music|Chetham’s School of Music]].

In the 1950s the city was home to the so-called ‘Manchester School’ of classical composers, which comprised [[Harrison Birtwistle]], [[Peter Maxwell Davies]] and [[Alexander Goehr]].

Among the others born in the [[Greater Manchester]] area are [[Richard Ashcroft]] and [[Jay Kay]]-the singer and mastermind of the acid jazz band Jamiroquai. 

In 1965, on the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Hot 100]], a unique hat-trick of consecutive [[Chart-topper|number 1]]s took place in the [[Spring (season)|spring]], all from Mancunian pop groups.  [[Freddie and the Dreamers]] spent two weeks at the top with "I'm Telling You Now" (between [[April 10]]–24), [[The Mindbenders|Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders]] one week with "Game of Love" ([[April 24]]-May 1), and finally [[Herman's Hermits]] with "Mrs Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter", a further three weeks ([[May 1]]–22), a total of six weeks, an achievement never matched even in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[Top 50]].

Manchester’s main pop music venue is the [[Manchester Evening News Arena]], situated next to [[Manchester Victoria railway station]], which seats over 21,000 and is the largest arena of its type in [[Europe]], voted ''International Arena of the Year'', beating [[New York City|New York]]’s [[Madison Square Garden]]. Other major venues include the [[Manchester Apollo]] and the [[Manchester Academy]]. The many smaller venues throughout the city, such as the Bierkeller, the Roadhouse and Night and Day Cafe, ensure that Manchester’s music scene is always vibrant and interesting.

The famous American anti-war hippie [[musical theatre|musical]] from the late [[sixties]], ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'', includes a song entitled "Manchester, England" though the mention of the city in the song's title is somewhat irrelevant and merely used as punctuation in the song's lyrics.

===Literature===
In the 19th Century, Manchester figured in novels that discussed the changes that industrialisation had brought to Britain. These included works such as:-
*''Mary Barton: A Tale of Manchester Life'' (1848) by [[Elizabeth Gaskell]], [http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/gaskell_elizabeth.shtml]
*''The Condition of the English Working Class in 1844'' written by [[Friedrich Engels]] while living and working in Manchester.

[[Charles Dickens]] is reputed to have set his novel ''Hard Times'' in the city, and while it is partly modelled on Preston, it shows the influence of his friend Elizabeth Gaskell [http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/dickens/pva/pva27.html].

[[Anthony Burgess]], author of ''[[A Clockwork Orange]]'', was born and educated in Manchester. ''[[Little Wilson and Big God, Being the First Part of the Confessions of Anthony Burgess|Little Wilson and Big God]]'', the first volume of his autobiography, includes a detailed account of his early life in the city between 1917 and 1940.

[[Howard Jacobson]], born in the [[Jewish]] area of [[Prestwich]], has written about post-war Manchester in ''The Mighty Walzer'' (1999) and ''Kalooki Nights'' (2006).

The Manchester novelist Maurice Procter was an early author of [[police procedural]] novels. Procter's ''Hell is a City'' (1954) is set in a fictionalised Manchester, later filmed in the city with lead roles for [[Donald Pleasence]] and [[Stanley Baker]] [http://www3.telus.net/public/nixonkg/hell_is_a_city.htm]. 

The German writer [[W. G. Sebald]] lived in Manchester when he first settled in England, and the city features prominently in his novel ''The Emigrants.''

The Mancunian [[Jeff Noon]] set his early novels, including [[Vurt]], in a future dystopian Manchester.

Nicholas Blincoe set his first three novels in Manchester, including ''Acid Casuals'' (1995), based around the nightclub [[The Hacienda]] and [[Manchester Slingback]] (1998), focussing on the Gay Village of [[Canal Street]].

The crime novelist [[Val McDermid]] lived in the city for many years and set her Lindsay Gordon series in Manchester.

Carcanet Press, founded as a poetry magazine, began publishing poetry collections and novels in the early 1970's under the editorship of Michael Schmidt [http://www.carcanet.co.uk/about.shtml]. Schmidt was one of the first directors of the [[Manchester Metropolitan University]] Writers School, whose staff currently includes [[Simon Armitage]] and [[Carol Ann Duffy]].

In Manchester is the [[Manchester Metropolitan University]] Writers School, one of the top creative writing schools in the country.

The Writer's Bureau — a private company set up to help new freelance writers through its home-study courses — runs its offices from Manchester.

In Manchester from October 2006 is the Manchester Literature Festival.

===Theatre===
Manchester is noted for its excellent theatres. Larger venues include [[the Manchester Opera House]], a commercial theatre promoting large scale touring shows which regularly plays host to touring [[West End theatre|West End]] shows, the [[Palace Theatre, Manchester|Palace Theatre]] and the [[Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester|Royal Exchange Theatre]], a large producing theatre in Manchester’s former cotton exchange. The [[Library Theatre]] is a small producing theatre situated in the basement of the city’s central library, and the [[Lowry Centre]] is a large touring venue in Salford. 

Smaller sites include the [[Green Room (Manchester)|Green Room]], which focuses on fringe productions, the [[Contact Theatre]], a theatre for young people with a bold contemporary design, and [[Studio Salford]], the theatre and music venue at Bloom Street, Salford. The [[Dancehouse]] is a theatre dedicated to dance productions. The city is also home to two highly-regarded drama schools; The [[Manchester Metropolitan University]] School of Theatre and the Arden School of Theatre. In addition the Royal Northern College of Music (RNCM) has 4 theatre spaces especially noted for its opera and classical music productions.

===Venues===
[[Image:MEN_Arena.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The [[MEN Arena]].]]

As well as many sporting venues Manchester has many venues for performances and conventions:
*[[GMex|Manchester Central]] - Comprising two separate venues formerly known as the ''GMEX Centre'' and ''Manchester International Conference Centre'' (MICC) respectively.
*[[Bridgewater Hall]]
*[[Lowry]]
*[[MEN Arena]]
*[[Manchester Academy]]
*[[Manchester Apollo]]

===Sport===
Sport and especially football are an important part of Manchester culture.

Many first class sporting facilities were built for the 2002 [[Commonwealth Games]], including the [[Manchester Velodrome]], the [[City of Manchester Stadium]], the [[National Squash Centre]] and the [[Manchester Aquatics Centre]].

Manchester is a successful sporting city with many famous sporting people heralding from the city as well as from the surrounding area of [[Greater Manchester]]. Manchester has competed twice to host the [[Olympic Games]], being beaten by [[Atlanta]] in 1996 and [[Sydney]] in 2000.

It was announced in 2005 that various sporting arenas around the city will be used as training facilities prior to the [[2012 Olympics]] in London.

====Football====

Two [[FA Premier League|Premiership]] [[football (soccer)|football]] clubs, [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], bear the city’s name. Manchester City's ground is at the [[City of Manchester Stadium]], while Manchester United’s [[Old Trafford (football)|Old Trafford]] ground, the largest club football ground in England, is just outside the city in the borough of [[Trafford]].

It is commonly perceived that Manchester City have more local support than Manchester United. However, research by Manchester University a few years ago showed that United had 9,000 season ticket holders within the [[M postal area]] and City had 7,000. The Manchester postal district includes the (strongly United supporting) city of [[Salford]] but also [[Prestwich]] and [[Whitefield]] (with one of the largest City supporters clubs) and areas such as [[Denton]], where United also have strong support. This research was done before City moved to the (larger, 48,000 capacity) [[City of Manchester Stadium]], and well before the expansion of United's [[Old Trafford]] stadium which will accommodate 76,000 by summer 2006. The truth is that nobody knows for sure which team has the most local support and that the figures are probably too similar to call. What is beyond doubt is that United's nationwide and international support far exceeds that of City, so City have larger local support as a proportion of their overall fan base.

[[Image:031658 a83397e7.jpg|250px|right|thumb|[[Manchester City]]'s [[City of Manchester Stadium]] during the [[Commonwealth games]]]]

City and United are just two examples of local football teams: according to the [[Urbis centre, Manchester|Urbis centre]], Greater Manchester has one of the highest concentration of football clubs, per capita, of anywhere in the world. Other professional football teams in Greater Manchester include [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]], [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]], [[Bury F.C.|Bury]], [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]], [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]] and [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]].

Manchester is also important to the history of football.  In 1868 a meeting was held in the city for representatives from the UK's football associations, and the [[International Football Association Board]], which makes the rules for the game, was formed following this meeting.

====Rugby football====
Although many of the big rugby teams in the [[North West England|north west of England]] play [[Rugby league|Rugby League]], Manchester's rugby teams have a long tradition by playing [[Rugby union|Rugby Union]].

'''[[Manchester Rugby Club]]''', was founded as the "Manchester Football Club" in 1860, eleven years before the formation of the [[Rugby Football Union]], the club is one of the oldest [[Rugby union|rugby union]] clubs in the world along with [[Blackheath Rugby Club]] and [[Liverpool St Helens F.C.]]. The club's ground is located at Grove Park in [[Cheadle Hulme]], and is divided into different sections - 1st XV, 2nd XV, Warriors, Ladies, and Mini, Juniors, Colts.<ref>[http://www.manchesterrugby.co.uk/ Manchester Rugby Club]</ref> ''See main article: [[Manchester Rugby Club]]''

'''Broughton Park Rugby Union F.C.''', is one of the oldest [[Rugby union|Rugby Union]] Clubs in England and was established in 1882, just one year after the Lancashire County Rugby Union was founded and eleven years after the formation of the national [[Rugby Football Union]]. 
The club has had a number of different grounds in its time, mainly in the Salford/Prestwich area, but also in the south of Manchester. Since 2004 its present new facility is at Hough End in [[Chorlton]], in South Manchester. 
Originally the club had only one senior side, but now fields four senior sides and supported by one Colts (U19), four youth (U13-U17) and four mini (U8-U12) teams; a total involvement of some 220 players each week. 
Broughton Park R.F.C. is the City of Manchester's highest placed representative in the Rugby Union Leagues. <ref>[http://www.broughton-park.org.uk/ Broughton Park Rugby Union F.C.]</ref>

'''Didsbury Toc-H Rugby (Union) Club''' was originally founded in 1924 as "Toc H Manchester" and was situated in Victoria Park. After moving to various sites the club arrived in [[Didsbury]] and in 1986 the name was changed to "Didsbury Toc-H" to identify with the location of the clubhouse. 
The club, which celebrated its 80th anniversary in 2003/2004, is located at Ford Lane in the heart of [[Didsbury]] Village, in the south of Manchester, close to neighbouring areas [[Withington]], [[Fallowfield]], [[Burnage]], and [[Stockport]].
The club fields four teams each week, the 1st team plays in the North Lancashire & Cumbria league, the 2nds, 3rds, and 4ths play in competitive "intermediate leagues". The club also has an established junior section.
The "Toc-H" part comes from a soldiers club at Poperinghe in [[Flanders]] in the [[First World War]]. Soldiers and officers could get a respite from the battlefields. This place was named Talbot House in honour of a young lieutenant who was killed in action the year before. Signallers pronounced the letters 'T' as 'Toc' and 'H' as 'House'. Today they'd be 'Tango' and 'Hotel'. When the rugby club was founded, Manchester soldiers called the new club as "Toc-H Manchester". <ref>[http://www.didsburyrfc.co.uk/ Didsbury Rugby (Union) Club]</ref>

The City of Manchester has also has other rugby teams: the [[University of Manchester]] Rugby Club<ref>[http://www.manunirugby.com/ The University of Manchester Rugby Club]</ref>, and Manchester Village Spartans RUFC.<ref>[http://www.villagespartans.co.uk/mvsrufc/index.html Manchester Village Spartans RUFC]</ref>

====Cricket====

[[Old Trafford (cricket)|Old Trafford]] cricket ground, the historic home of [[Lancashire County Cricket Club]], hosts many [[first-class cricket]] and important international matches including Test Matches.

====Other sports====

[[Belle Vue (Motorcycle Racing)|Belle Vue Stadium]] in [[Gorton]] is home to the [[Belle Vue Aces]] speedway team and also hosts regular [[greyhound racing|greyhound races]].

Manchester also has an [[ice hockey]] team called the [[Manchester Phoenix]] who are in the process of building an arena called the [[Altrincham Ice Dome]]. The city was previously home to the [[Manchester Storm]] ice hockey club who in 1997 played in front of the largest audience ever to watch an ice hockey game in the United Kingdom when 17,245 people saw the Storm defeat the [[Sheffield Steelers]] 6-2 at the [[MEN Arena]].

===Gay and lesbian===
Manchester has the UK's largest gay population outside of London, and is renowned for its [[Gay Village]]. Centred around the [[Canal Street, Manchester|Canal Street]] area the Gay Village is home to numerous gay shops, restaurants, bars and clubs. On the last weekend in August it hosts the Manchester Pride Festival (previously known as [[Mardi Gras]] and Gayfest).

The 'Canal Street' sign, situated at the top of the walk has also been heightened further up the lamp post on which it is situated many times, due to pranksters painting over the C and S to make it 'Anal Treet'.

Manchester’s gay culture was brought to mainstream attention in 1999 by the acclaimed and controversial [[Channel 4]] drama series ''[[Queer as Folk (UK)|Queer as Folk]]'', which was set in the Village. It is also the birthplace of several gay rights organisations including the [[Campaign for Homosexual Equality]] and the [[Queer Youth Alliance]]. Manchester has its own gay sports teams, Village Manchester FC ([[soccer]]), Northern Wave ([[swimming]]) and Village Spartans ([[Rugby football|Rugby]]) which take part in Manchester's annual Pride Games.

The year round [http://www.manchesterpride.com/whatson.asp?ID=96 gay and lesbian heritage trail] exhibits Manchester’s gay history. Manchester’s claim to status of "gay capital of the UK" was strengthened in 2003 when it played host city to the annual [[Europride]] festival. The [[Lesbian and Gay Foundation]], Britain's biggest gay charity, is based on Princess Street in the city centre.

Marketing Manchester, the tourist board for Manchester, has produced a site dedicated to informing LGBT visitors about what is happening in the city and offering a unique tourist guide. This may be found at visitgaymanchester.com

==Media==
===Television and radio===
[[ITV]] franchisee [[Granada Television]] has its original headquarters on Quay Street in the Castlefield area of the city. The city is where programmes including [[Coronation Street]] and many [[CiTV|Children’s ITV]] presentations are produced.

The [[BBC]] has its headquarters for the North West in New Broadcasting House on Oxford Road in the south of the city. Programmes including [[A Question of Sport]], [[Mastermind (television)|Mastermind]] and [[Real Story]] are made here. Manchester is also the regional base for the [[BBC One]] North West Region so programmes like ''North West Tonight'' are produced here. The BBC intends to relocate large numbers of staff and facilities to Manchester or Salford from London, once a new, larger site has been selected. The Children's([[CBBC]]), Comedy, Sport ([[BBC Sport]]) and New Media departments are all scheduled for a move from London to Manchester or Salford before 2010.

Manchester has its own television channel, [[Channel M]], owned by the [[Guardian Media Group]] and operated since 2000. It also has several local radio stations including [[BBC Radio Manchester]], [[Key 103]], [[Galaxy Manchester|Galaxy]], [[Piccadilly Magic 1152]], [[105.4 Century FM]] , [[Smooth FM 100.4|100.4 Smooth FM]], [[Capital Gold 1458]], 96.2 [[The Revolution]] and [[Xfm Manchester|Xfm]]. There is a [[community radio]] network coordinated by Radio Regen, and with stations covering the South Manchester communities of [[Ardwick]], [[Longsight]] and [[Levenshulme]] ([[ALL FM]] 96.9) and [[Wythenshawe]] (Wythenshawe FM 97.2)

Several now defunct radio stations are much lamented including Sunset (which became) [[Kiss 102]] (now [[Galaxy]]), and KFM which became Signal Cheshire (now [[Signal 1]]). The latter three played a significant role in the city's emerging [[House music]] culture, also known as the [[Madchester]] scene, which was partly based around clubs like the [[the Hacienda]] which had its own show on Kiss 102. There were also scores of [[pirate radio]], [[Campus radio|student radio]] (currently consisting of Fuse FM at the [[University of Manchester]] and Shock FM at the University of Salford) and [[community radio]] stations and initiatives in Manchester.

BBC Radio Manchester, which became BBC GMR in 1988, returned to its former title in 2006.

The character of [[Daphne Moon]] in [[Frasier]] (the role which eventually made [[Jane Leeves]] the highest-paid British actress on television) came from Manchester.

===Film===
Manchester is home to the Manchester film festival and has held the commonwealth film festival.

Even [[Hollywood]] has featured Manchester occasionally in its films. ''[[My Son, My Son!]]'', made in 1940, directed by [[Charles Vidor]] and starring [[Brian Aherne]] and [[Louis Hayward]], is set in Manchester, and in [[MGM]]'s all-star opus of 1932, ''[[Grand Hotel (film)|Grand Hotel]]'', most of [[Wallace Beery]]'s dialogue seems to consist of him furiously shouting "Manchester!" throughout his entire part. Manchester over the years has shot many films from the [[Ewan McGregor]] blockbuster [[Velvet Goldmine]] to [[Sir Alec Guinness]]'s [[The Man in the White Suit]].

{{Seealso|Films set in Manchester}}

===Magazines and newspapers===
''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper was founded in Manchester in 1821 as ''The Manchester Guardian''. Its head office is still in Manchester, though many of its management functions were moved to [[London]] in 1964. It still shares a Manchester office on Deansgate with its sister publication, the ''[[Manchester Evening News]]'', Manchester’s biggest-selling daily paper now free within the city centre, and Greater Manchester's biggest-circulation newspaper, the free weekly Manchester Metro News. Other free commuting papers include [[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]] North West, both of which are available from [[Metrolink]] stops, rail stations and other busy locations across the city at rush-hour.

For many years most of the national newspapers had important offices in Manchester: ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', ''[[Daily Express]]'', ''[[Daily Mail]]'', ''[[The Daily Mirror]]'', ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]''. Only ''[[The Daily Sport]]'' remain based in Manchester. At its height 1,500 journalists were employed. But in the 1980s office closures began and today the "second Fleet Street" is no more. A late attempt to launch a Northern daily newspaper, ''North West Times'', floundered in the late 80s lasting just three months. Another attempt was made with the [[North West Enquirer]], which was Manchester based and hoped to provide a true "regional" newspaper for the [[North West England|North West]], much in the same vein as the ''[[Yorkshire Post]]'' does for [[Yorkshire]] or ''[[The Northern Echo]]'' does for the [[North East England|North East]]. It folded in October 2006.

There are several local lifestyle magazines, including 'Moving Manchester' amongst others.
