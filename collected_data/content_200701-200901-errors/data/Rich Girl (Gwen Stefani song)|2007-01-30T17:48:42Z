"'''Rich Girl'''" is a [[pop music|pop]]&ndash;[[reggae music|reggae]] performed by singer [[Gwen Stefani]] featuring [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]]. It was primarily written by [[Dr. Dre]], Eve and Stefani with other collaborators for Stefani's debut solo album ''[[Love. Angel. Music. Baby.|Love. Angel. Music. Baby]]'' (2004). The song was released as the album's second [[single (music)|single]] in 2005 (see [[2005 in music]]) and was a worldwide success; it reached number two in [[Australia]] and the top twenty on the majority of the [[record chart|chart]]s it entered. This song was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration|Best Rap/Sung Collaboration]] at the [[Grammy Awards of 2006]], but lost to [[Jay-Z]] & [[Linkin Park]]'s "[[Numb/Encore]]".

==Writing process==
The song was co-written by Stefani, Eve, [[Dr. Dre]], [[Kara DioGuardi]], [[Chantal Kreviazuk]], and [[Mike Elizondo]], and produced by Dr. Dre. The song interpolates the song "[[If I Were a Rich Man (song)|If I Were a Rich Man]]" written by [[Sheldon Harnick]] and [[Jerry Bock]] for the musical ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]''. The track features Eve, with whom Stefani had already previously collaborated with on "[[Let Me Blow Ya Mind]]" (2001).

Although the song is based on "If I Were a Rich Man", it was also an adaptation of an earlier pop song by [[United Kingdom|British]] [[reggae]] musicians Louchie Lou and Michie One. Eve maintained the reggae style used by the earlier duo and added in her own new rhymes, whereas Stefani added new lyrics and changed some of the melody from the older song. Louchie Lou and Michie One's 1993 version of "Rich Girl" was itself an adaptation of "If I Were a Rich Man". The melody of the chorus and many of the words were kept the same among all three songs. [[Dancehall]] queen [[Lady Saw]], who cooperated with Stefani on the No Doubt song "Underneath it all" also made very similar version of the song in 1999.

"Rich Girl" was unusual for a Stefani track in that it was not based on her own personal experience. On her website, Stefani states: "Dre was really pushing me to write in a new way and I'm not going to question him. The whole reason you work with someone like Dre is that you want to know what they think. He's such a great producer because he really knows how to get the best out of you and make you feel good about yourself. 'Rich Girl' is so fresh, so Dre, he just totally tricked the track out."{{ref|Stefaniquote}}

==Music video==

The [[music video]] for "Rich Girl" was [[music-video director|directed]] by [[David LaChapelle]] and shot in [[California]], [[United States]]; it depicts Gwen Stefani and Eve on a pirate ship. The video begins with four [[Japan|Japanese]] school-girls playing with a pirate ship and [[Bratz]] dolls, discussing what they would do if they were a "rich girl". The video features three different sequences; Stefani is first shown on board the pirate ship bellow deck, dancing on a table, singing to the song. She is surrounded by other "pirates" and is soon joined up Eve, wearing an eyepatch; above deck Stefani and her dancers, also dressed as pirates, dance; Stefani is also seen dancing with a sword. The video concludes with the four Japanese school-girls laughingly dropping the pirate ship in a fish tank, causing Stefani and her fellow pirates to fall all over the ship. "Rich Girl" is Stefani's second music video to feature her [[Harajuku Girls]], who appear in the video as her back up dancers in scenes above deck and when she is dancing with a sword, fantasising about shopping in an upmarket boutique. In the song Stefani sings "I'd dress them wicked, I'd give them names, Love, Angel, Music, Baby", causing Stefani to be criticized for reinforcing [[ethnic stereotypes|racial stereotypes]] of Asian women. In the video when she signs these lyrics, Stefani makes the hand gestures as if she is dressing the Harajuku Girls up, treating them like dolls.

The music video was a success on video channels and it reached number four on [[MTV]]'s ''[[Total Request Live]]''.

== Chart performance ==
After the disappointment of "[[What You Waiting For]]?" in the U.S., [[Interscope Records|Interscope]] wanted "Rich Girl" to become a big hit. It did when it reached number seven on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], a position it maintained for two weeks. Despite exhibiting influences of modern hip hop, the song was able to crossover and enter the [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[Adult Top 40]] formats, but it did not remain on these charts for very long. Although the song failed to receive airplay on R&B radio, its relatively high sales of its 12" single helped propel the song onto the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks]] chart. "Rich Girl" was helped on the Hot 100 and Pop 100 by its strong digital downloads, peaking at number two and number three on the [[Hot Digital Songs]] and [[Hot Digital Tracks]] respectively. Due to its high number of digital downloads, the song was awarded a double platinum single for sales of 400,000 downloads.

Elsewhere, "Rich Girl" peaked within the top twenty on the majority of the charts it entered. It debuted at number two in Australia, where it became Stefani's second top-five single. The song also charted highly in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] at number four. "Rich Girl" (with "What You Waiting For?") were the two highest-charting ''Love. Angel. Music. Baby.'' singles in the UK, because the following three did not reach the top five.

Although "Rich Girl" was more successful than its predecessor in [[Canada]], it failed to enter the top ten and peaked at number twelve for one week. Because the [[CD single]] was released two months after the song began receiving [[airplay (radio)|airplay]], it had already peaked in popularity and was unable to chart higher. On the [[Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems|BDS]] Airplay Chart, it reached number two. 

Across [[Europe]], "Rich Girl" was largely successful: it reached the top five in [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]], and the top ten in [[Italy]] and [[Switzerland]]. It was also successful in [[South America]] and reached the top forty in most countries including [[Argentina]] and [[Brazil]].
