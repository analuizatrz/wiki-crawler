'''''Nepenthes bicalcarata''''' ([[Latin]]: ''bi'' = two, ''calcaratus'' = spur), also known as the '''Fanged Pitcher-Plant''',<ref name=P&L>Phillipps, A. & A. Lamb 1996. ''Pitcher-Plants of Borneo''. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu.</ref> is a tropical [[pitcher plant]] species native to northwestern [[Borneo]].

==Early history==

''N. bicalcarata'' was formally described by [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] in 1873 based on specimens collected by [[Hugh Low]] and [[Odoardo Beccari]].<ref>Hooker, J.D. 1873. Nepenthaceae. In: A. De Candolle ''Prodromus systematis universalis regni vegetabilis'' '''17''': 90–105.</ref> The species was introduced to Europe in 1879 by British explorer [[Frederick William Burbidge]], who collected plants for the famous [[Veitch Nursery]]. These were cultivated to larger size and distributed in 1881.<ref name=P&L />

During this time, interest in ''Nepenthes'' had reached its peak. A note in ''[[The Gardeners' Chronicle]]'' of 1881 mentions the Veitch Nursery's ''N. bicalcarata'' as follows:<ref>[Anonymous] 1881. Messr's Veitch's Nepenthes House. ''The Gardeners' Chronicle'' n. ser. '''16''': 598.</ref>

<blockquote>Then there is ''N. bicalcarata'', a most robust habited kind with sturdy foliage and bag-like pitchers provided with a vicious-looking rat-trap-like apparatus in its lid which renders it very distinct from its neighbours.</blockquote>

Several years after its introduction, ''N. bicalcarata'' was still very much a horticultural rarity. In Veitch's catalogue for 1889, ''N. bicalcarata'' was priced at [[Pound sterling|£]]3.3[[shilling|s]] per plant, while the famous giant-pitchered ''[[Nepenthes northiana|N. northiana]]'' and ''[[Nepenthes rajah|N. rajah]]'' were selling for £2.2s.<ref name=P&L />

==Description==

''N. bicalcarata'' plants are the largest in the genus, climbing up to 20 m into the forest [[Canopy (forest)|canopy]]. The cylindrical stem is thicker than that of any other ''Nepenthes'' species, measuring up to 3.5 cm in diameter. [[Internode]]s are up to 40 cm long.<ref name=Clarke>Clarke, C.M. 1997. ''Nepenthes of Borneo''.  Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu.</ref>

[[Image:Bicalcarata-hideinbush.jpg|thumb|left|Rosette plant]]

The leaves of ''N. bicalcarata'' are [[wikt:petiolate|petiolate]] and [[wikt:coriaceous|coriaceous]] in texture. The [[wikt:lamina|lamina]] is [[wikt:obovate|obovate]]-[[wikt:lanceolate|lanceolate]] in form and also reaches huge dimensions, growing to 80 cm in length and 12 cm in width.<ref>Danser, B.H. 1928. The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies. ''Bulletin de Jardin de Botanique, Buitenzorg'', Série III, '''9'''(3–4): 249–438.</ref> It is slightly [[wikt:decurrent|decurrent]] on the stem, forming two narrow wings. The lamina has indistinct longitudinal veins and numerous [[wikt:pennate|pennate]] veins. [[Tendril]]s may be up to 60 cm long and 8 mm wide. They are hollow and swollen near the pitcher.<ref name=Clarke />

Although most parts of the plant are very large, the pitchers themselves do not rival those of species such as ''[[Nepenthes rajah|N. rajah]]''. Nevertheless, they may have a volume of over one litre and grow up to 25 cm high and 16 cm wide. The two sharp spines for which the species is famous are present on the underside of the pitcher lid, and may be 3 cm long. These are actually some of the largest [[nectar]] [[gland]]s in the plant kingdom.<ref name=C&L>Clarke, C.M. & C.C. Lee 2004. ''Pitcher Plants of Sarawak''. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu.</ref> Two prominent fringed wings (≤15 mm wide) run down the front of lower pitchers. These are usually reduced to ribs in aerial pitchers. The [[peristome]] (≤20 mm wide) is characteristically flattened and curved inwards. It bears small but distinct teeth. The pitcher lid or [[operculum]] is [[wikt:reniform|reniform]] to [[wikt:cordate|cordate]] and has no appendages. An unbranched [[Spur (biology)|spur]] (≤15 mm long) is inserted at the base of the lid.<ref name=Clarke />

''N. bicalcarata'' has a [[panicle|paniculate]] [[inflorescence]]. The [[peduncle]] may be up to 40 cm long and the [[rachis]] can reach 100 cm in length. Female inflorescences are usually shorter.<ref>Macfarlane, J.M. 1908. Nepenthaceae. In: A. Engler ''Das Pflanzenreich'' IV, III (Heft 36).</ref> Branches on the flower stem are up to 40 mm long and bear up to 15 flowers. [[Sepal]]s are either [[wikt:obovate|obovate]] or [[wikt:lanceolate|lanceolate]] and up to 4 mm long.<ref name=Clarke />

Mature plants are virtually [[wikt:glabrous|glabrous]]. [[wikt:caducous|Caducous]] hairs are present on the youngest parts of the plant and on the inflorescences.

''N. bicalcarata'' varies little across its range. Consequently, no [[infraspecific taxon|infraspecific taxa]] have been described.<ref name=Clarke />

==Association with ants==
[[Image:Bicalcarata-upperpitcher.jpg|thumb|Upper pitcher with swollen tendril colonised by ''Camponotus schmitzi''.]]
''N. bicalcarata'' plays host to an unusual species of [[ant]] that makes its nest in the plant's hollow tendrils.<ref name=Clarke /><ref>Shelford, R. 1916. ''A naturalist in Borneo''. T.

Stärke, den Dolder. ''Overdruk uit het Natuurhistorisch Maandblad'' '''22'''(3): 29–31.</ref> it is a member of the extremely populous and widespread genus of [[carpenter ant]]s.

This unique animal-plant interaction was noted by [[Frederick William Burbidge]] as early as 1880.<ref>Burbidge, F.W. 1880. ''The Gardens of the Sun''. Murray, London. 364 pp.</ref> In 1904, [[Odoardo Beccari]] suggested that the ants feed on insects found on and around the plant, but may fall prey to it themselves.<ref>Beccari, O. 1904. ''Wanderings in the great forests of Borneo''. Archibald and Constable, London.</ref> In 1990, B. Hölldobler and E.O. Wilson proposed that ''N. bicalcarata'' and ''C. schmitzi'' form a [[mutualism|mutually beneficial]] association.<ref>Hölldobler, B. & E.O. Wilson 1990. ''The Ants''. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany.</ref> At the time, however, no experimental data existed to support such a hypothesis. A series of observations and experiments carried out in [[Brunei]] by [[Charles Clarke (botanist)|Charles Clarke]] in 1992 and 1998,<ref>Clarke, C.M. 1992. The ecology of metazoan communities in ''Nepenthes'' pitcher plants in Borneo, with special reference to the community of ''Nepenthes bicalcarata'' Hook.f.

The aquatic arthropod community of the pitcher plant, ''Nepenthes bicalcarata'' (Nepenthaceae) in Brunei.

''Journal of Tropical Ecology'' '''11'''(4): 589–602.</ref> strongly support the [[mutualism]] theory.

The ants feed by descending into the pitcher fluid and retrieving [[arthropod]]s caught by the plant. The ants seem to ignore smaller insects and only target larger prey items. Hauling food from the pitcher fluid to the peristome, a distance of no more than 5 cm, may take up to 12 hours.<ref name=Clarke /> In this way the contents of ''N. bicalcarata'' pitchers is controlled such that organic matter does not accumulate to the point of [[putrefaction]], which can lead to the demise of [[nepenthes infauna|pitcher infauna]] (which also appear to benefit the plant) and sometimes the pitcher itself.<ref name=Clarke />

The ants seem to favour upper pitchers and rarely colonise lower pitchers.<ref>Clarke, C.M. 1997. The effects of pitcher dimorphism on the metazoan community of the carnivorous pitcher plant ''Nepenthes bicalcarata'' Hook.f.. ''Malayan Nature Journal'' '''50''': 149–157.</ref> This is likely due to the fact that terrestrial traps are periodically submerged in water during heavy rains. Flooding of the ants' nest chamber could result in the death of the developing eggs, [[larva]]e, and [[pupa]]e.<ref name=C&L />

''C. schmitzi'' nests solely in the tendrils of ''N. bicalcarata'' and rarely ventures onto other plants. The species is completely dependent on ''N. bicalcarata'' for food and [[wikt:domicile|domicile]].<ref name=Clarke /> ''N. bicalcarata'', on the other hand, is able to survive and reproduce without the presence of the ants; it is a [[Mutualism|facultative mutualist]]. This being the case, there appear to be few mature plants over 2 metres in height not colonised by ''C. schmitzi''.<ref name=Clarke />

John Thompson suggests that ''N. bicalcarata'' may be the only plant species that obtains nutrients through both insect capture and ant-hosting habits.<ref>Thompson, J.H. 1981. Reverse animal-plant interactions: the evolution of insectivorous and ant-fed plants. ''Biological Journal of the Linnean Society'' '''16''': 147–155.</ref>

==Ecology and conservation status==
[[Image:Bicalcarata-habitat(peatswamp).jpg|thumb|Natural habitat of ''N. bicalcarata'']]
''N. bicalcarata'' is [[endemism|endemic]] to [[Borneo]]. It is most common in the [[peat swamp]] forests of the western coast of the island, which stretch across [[Sarawak]], [[Sabah]], [[Kalimantan]], and [[Brunei]]. There it often grows in the shade of the ubiquitous [[dipterocarp]] ''[[Shorea albida]]''.<ref name=P&L /> ''N. bicalcarata'' also occurs in [[kerangas forest|''kerangas'' forest]] and has even been recorded from white sand [[heath forest]]s in [[Sarawak]] and [[East Kalimantan]].<ref name=P&L /> The species is often [[sympatric]] with ''[[Nepenthes ampullaria|N. ampullaria]]'' in these habitats.<ref name=Clarke />

Specimens growing in undisturbed peat swamp forest, where sunlight is greatly diffused and high humidity prevails, reach the largest dimensions.<ref name=Clarke /> ''N. bicalcarata'' has a shallow root system that only penetrates the top layer of [[peat]] and [[leaf litter]], to a depth of about 25 cm. Below this, high concentrations of [[tannin]]s and [[alkaloid]]s render the substrate toxic.<ref name=P&L />

''N. bicalcarata'' is generally found below 300 m in altitude, although H. Hallier reported a single collection in 1894 from between 700 and 950 m above sea level.<ref>Hallier, H. 1895. Ein neues ''Cypripedium'' aus Borneo. ''Natuurkundig Tijdschrift voor Nederlandsch Indië'' LIV: 450–452.</ref>

The [[conservation status]] of ''N. bicalcarata'' is listed as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]] on the [[IUCN Red List|2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] based on an assessment carried out in 2000.<ref>Schnell, D., P. Catling, G. Folkerts, C. Frost, R. Gardner, ''et al.'' 2000. [http://www.iucnredlist.org/search/details.php/39624/all ''Nepenthes bicalcarata'']. ''2006 [[IUCN Red List|IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]]''. [[World Conservation Union|IUCN]] 2006. Retrieved on 11 May 2006. Listed as Vulnerable (VU B1+2c v2.3).</ref> In 1997, [[Charles Clarke (botanist)|Charles Clarke]] informally classified the species as [[Near Threatened]] based on the [[World Conservation Union|IUCN]] criteria.<ref name=Clarke />

==Cultivation==
[[Image:Nepenthes bicalcarata.jpg|thumb|Lower pitcher of a plant cultivated in [[Kuching]], [[Sarawak]].]]
''N. bicalcarata'' may be cultivated in a similar manner to other members of the genus, though it requires relatively hot and humid conditions.<ref>D'Amato, P. 1998. ''The Savage Garden — Cultivating Carnivorous Plants''. Ten Speed Press, Berkley, California.</ref> It needs large pots to do well, and temporary halts in growth are often due to becoming root-bound.  Re-potting to a larger pot will often result in a rapid size increase.  Under satisfactory conditions, this plant will grow quite fast for a ''Nepenthes'', reaching a large size relatively rapidly. 

==Natural hybrids==

The following natural [[hybrid]]s involving ''N. bicalcarata'' have been recorded.

*''[[Nepenthes ampullaria|N. ampullaria]]'' &times; ''N. bicalcarata''<ref name=Clarke />
*(''[[Nepenthes ampullaria|N. ampullaria]]'' &times; ''[[Nepenthes gracilis|N. gracilis]]'') &times; ''N. bicalcarata'' [=''[[Nepenthes x trichocarpa|N. &times; trichocarpa]]'' &times; ''N. bicalcarata'']
*''N. bicalcarata'' &times; ''[[Nepenthes gracilis|N. gracilis]]'' [=''[[Nepenthes x cantleyi|N. &times; cantleyi]]'']<ref name=Clarke />
*''N. bicalcarata'' &times; ''[[Nepenthes mirabilis|N. mirabilis]]''<ref name=Clarke />
*''N. bicalcarata'' &times; ''[[Nepenthes rafflesiana|N. rafflesiana]]''<ref name=Clarke />
*? (''N. bicalcarata'' &times; ''[[Nepenthes rafflesiana|N. rafflesiana]]'') &times; [[Nepenthes mirabilis|''N. mirabilis'' var. ''echinostoma'']]<ref name=Clarke />

None of these hybrids are known to be colonised by ''C. schmitzi'' as is the parent species ''N. bicalcarata''.<ref name=Clarke />

===''N. ampullaria'' &times; ''N. bicalcarata''===

Since ''N. ampullaria'' and ''N. bicalcarata'' are often sympatric in the wild, it is not surprising that they occasionally hybridise. Several examples of this natural hybrid are known from [[Brunei]], where it grows in [[peat swamp forest]] and [[heath forest]].<ref name=Clarke /> It was first recorded by [[Mitsuru Hotta]] in 1966.<ref>Hotta, M. 1966. Notes on Bornean Plants. ''Acta Phytotaxonomica et Geobotanica'' '''22'''(1–2): 7–9.</ref>

Pitchers bear the characteristic thorns of ''N. bicalcarata'', although they are greatly reduced in size. The mouth is round and the lid is [[wikt:ovate|ovate]]-[[wikt:cordate|cordate]] in form. This hybrid resembles ''[[Nepenthes x hookeriana|N. &times; hookeriana]]'' to a certain extent, but differs in having spines on the underside of the lid and more globose upper pitchers with a smaller lid.<ref name=Clarke />

Aerial pitchers of ''N. ampullaria'' &times; ''N. bicalcarata'' are usually dominated by characteristics of ''N. ampullaria''. They are often very small and unable to function in a normal manner.<ref name=Clarke />
