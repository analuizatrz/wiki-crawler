The '''Mark Messier Leadership Award''' recognizes an individual as a superior leader within their sport, and as a contributing member of society. The award honors an individual who leads by positive example through on-ice performance, motivation of team members and a dedication to community activities and charitable causes.

The new Award, inaugurated during the [[2006-07 NHL season]], is given to a player selected by [[Mark Messier]] who best exemplifies leadership skills on and off the ice. Good leaders are catalysts for positive action. They apply vision, passion and preparation to influence others to work toward a common goal. They motivate with confidence, enthusiasm and good communication skills. They have strong beliefs, lead by example and bring out the best in others. They show credibility and integrity on a consistent basis.

Over the course of the season, five (5) [[NHL]] players will be honored with monthly awards. The NHL will assist in the selection and qualification of potential recipients with the final decision made by Mark Messier. At the end of the regular season, one overall "Leader of the Year" for the 2006-07 NHL Season will be named recipient of the Mark Messier Leadership Award. The "Leader Of The Year" will have their name permanently engraved on the Mark Messier Leadership Award. The design of the award will be showcased later this season.
