{{nihongo|'''''Final Fantasy VII'''''|ファイナルファンタジーVII|Fainaru Fantajī Sebun}} is a [[console role-playing game]] developed by [[Square Co.|Square]] (now [[Square Enix]]) and published by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] as the seventh installment in the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series. It was released in 1997 for [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]]'s [[PlayStation]] and in 1998 for [[Microsoft]]'s [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]-based [[personal computer]]s. The game is the first in the series to use [[3D computer graphics]], featuring fully rendered characters on [[pre-rendered]] backgrounds.

Set in a [[dystopia|dystopian]] world, ''Final Fantasy VII''{{'}}s story centers on the powerful [[megacorporation]] Shinra, which is draining the life of the planet to use as an energy source. Players follow a young mercenary called [[Cloud Strife]], who joins with several others to stop Shinra. As the story evolves, the main antagonist, [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]], develops a plan to summon a meteor with the intention of injuring the planet to a point where it would gather massive amounts of its life force in one spot, allowing Sephiroth to collect all the life force and gain control of all living beings.

Development of ''Final Fantasy VII'' began in 1994 and was originally intended as another 2D project for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] with a [[New York]] setting. However, the development team decided to use 3D computer graphics instead and moved onto the [[Nintendo 64]]. After deciding to implement the features of the [[tech demo]] "''[[Final Fantasy VI#Interactive CG Game|Final Fantasy SGI]]''" the game would not be able to fit into Nintendo 64's cartridges, prompting Square to move onto Sony's PlayStation system, which used CD-ROMs.

The game was a major critical and commercial success, and remains arguably the most popular title in the series.<ref>{{cite video | date=2007-08-13 | url=http://www.gametrailers.com/player/23449.html | title=Final Fantasy Retrospective Part V | medium=GameTrailers.com feature | publisher=[[GameTrailers]]|accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref><ref name="mainstream">{{cite web | date=October 2003 | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_zd1up/is_200310/ai_ziff109006 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070819111216/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_zd1up/is_200310/ai_ziff109006 | archivedate=2007-08-19 | title=Final Fantasy VII Advent Children | publisher=Find Articles; originally published in [[1UP.com]] | accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref><ref name="mainstream2">{{cite web | date=2006-08-29 | url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2006-08-29-dirge-of-cerberus_x.htm | title='Dirge of Cerberus' defies expectations, for better and worse | work=[[USA Today]] |first=Alex|last=Kraus| accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://uk.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/greatestgames/index.html | title=The Greatest Games of All Time | accessdate=2008-07-16|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|author=GameSpot Editorial Team}}</ref> The ongoing popularity of the title led Square Enix to produce a series of [[sequel]]s and [[prequel]]s under the collective title ''[[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII]]''. As of December 2005, ''Final Fantasy VII'' has sold more than 9.8 million copies worldwide, earning it the position of the best-selling ''Final Fantasy'' title, and the [[List of best-selling video games#PlayStation|second-best-selling PlayStation game]] (behind ''[[Gran Turismo]]'').

==Gameplay==
Like previous installments of the ''Final Fantasy'' series, ''Final Fantasy VII'' consists of three basic gameplay modes: an [[overworld]] map, town and [[Dungeon (games)|dungeon]] field maps, and a battle screen. The overworld map is a 3D model, featuring a scaled-down simplified version of the game's [[fictional universe|fictional world]],<ref name="travel">{{cite book | year=1997 | editor=Square Electronic Arts | title=Final Fantasy VII North American instruction manual | pages=15, 44–46 | publisher=Sony computer entertainment|language=English|id=SCUS-94163}}</ref> which the player navigates to travel between the game's locations. It is the first ''Final Fantasy'' game to have character models with fully-rendered polygons, rather than flat two-dimensional [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]]. As with the preceding games in the series, the world map can be traversed by foot or by [[Chocobo]]s, an airship, a submarine, etc.<ref name="travel"/> On field maps, the game's 3D [[player character|playable characters]] are directed across realistically scaled environments, consisting of [[2D computer graphics|2D]] pre-rendered backgrounds, which represent locations such as towns or forests.<ref name="ignreview">{{cite web | author=IGN Staff | date=1997-09-03 | title=Final Fantasy VII Review | url=http://psx.ign.com/articles/150/150494p1.html | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref><ref name="gamespotreview">{{cite web | author=Kasavin, Greg | date=1997-09-27 | title=Final Fantasy VII for PlayStation Review | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps/rpg/finalfantasy7/review.html | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref> The battle screen is a 3D representation of an area, such as a building's interior or open grassland, in which the player commands the game's characters in battles against [[central processing unit|CPU]]-controlled enemies through a menu-driven interface.<ref>{{cite book | year=1997 | editor=Square Electronic Arts | title=Final Fantasy VII North American instruction manual | pages=20–25 | publisher=Square Electronic Arts | language=English | id=SCUS-94163}}</ref> While characters are miniaturized on maps, in combat the character models are more realistic and normal-scaled.

Initially, the player is restricted to a more linear travel within the city of Midgar, but as the game continues, the entire world becomes accessible, giving the player more freedom to explore.<ref name="travel"/> Progression through the game's storyline is largely developed by way of scripted sequences and require frequent player interaction to proceed. At other times, pre-rendered cinematic [[cut scene]]s advance the story.

[[Image:FFVIIbattlexample.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A battle in ''Final Fantasy VII'']]

===Combat===
During its turn-based battle sequences, the game uses the same [[Square Enix battle systems#Active Time Battle|Active Time Battle]] (ATB) system designed by [[Hiroyuki Ito]] and first featured in ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]''. Unlike previous games in the series, which allow 4-5 playable characters to participate in battle, ''Final Fantasy VII'' allows only three characters to be in the party at any time.<ref name="ignreview"/>

''Final Fantasy VII''{{'}}s [[statistic (role-playing games)#Skills|skill system]] is built around the use of [[materia]], magical orbs that are placed in special slots on weapons and armor, allowing players to customize their characters' access to [[Final Fantasy magic|magic spells]], summons, and special abilities. The use of materia is a double-edged sword, however, as the more materia a character has equipped the physically weaker he or she becomes. In addition to their individual attributes, materia can be used together in a fixed number of ways to enhance their effects or produce other abilities.<ref>{{cite book | year=1997 | editor=Square Electronic Arts | title=Final Fantasy VII North American instruction manual | pages=35 | publisher=Square Electronic Arts | language=English | id=SCUS-94163}}</ref>

A modified form of ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]'''s "Desperation Attacks" appears in ''Final Fantasy VII'' as the "Limit Break". Every playable character has a bar that gradually fills up when they suffer damage in battle. When the bar is completely filled, the character is able to unleash his or her Limit Break, a special attack which generally inflicts significantly more damage on enemies than normal attacks, or otherwise aids the party in battle. Unlike materia, which any character could use, each character has his/her own unique Limit Breaks. Character designer and battle director [[Tetsuya Nomura]] implemented this advanced form of Desperation Attacks in response to the low probability of their occurrence in ''Final Fantasy VI'', where they would randomly become available as an attack substitution only when a character's [[hit point]]s were low.

Nomura decided to incorporate elaborately animated summon spells in the game, one of which lasts more than a minute. This idea became popular with ''Final Fantasy'' fans, and they were incorporated into the development of future games in the series. A summon consists of a name for each summon materia (Odin, Bahamut, Titan, etc.), the name of the attack used by each summon, a short animation clip in which the summon makes its attack, and the end of the attack, during which the number of damage points inflicted appears. However, critics have described these animations as tedious.<ref>{{cite book | year=2001 | editor=Kennedy, Sam; Steinman, Gary | title=Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine August 2001; issue 47 | pages=98 | language=English | publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]}}</ref>

===Setting===
{{main|Gaia (Final Fantasy VII)}}
The game's setting follows in the footsteps of ''Final Fantasy VI'' by presenting a world with considerably more advanced technology than the first five games in the series. Overall, the game's technology and society approximates that of modern or near-future [[science fiction]].<ref name="scifisetting">{{cite web | title=Behind The Game The Creators | url=http://www.square-enix-usa.com/games/FFX/btg/creators.html#1 | publisher=Square Enix North America | accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref><ref name="scifi">{{cite book | year=2001 | editor=Editors of Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine | title=Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine August 2001; issue 47 | pages=16 | language=English | publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]}}</ref> The world of ''Final Fantasy VII'', retroactively named "Gaia" but referred to in the game as "The Planet", is composed of three main land masses. The eastern continent features the city of Midgar, an industrial [[metropolis]] that serves as the headquarters of the Shinra Electric Power Company, a ruthless mega corporation that operates as the [[de facto]] [[world government]]. Shinra's major military base, Junon, a reactor that has a condor perched on top of it (aptly named Fort Condor) along with a chocobo ranch and a small town called Kalm.

The western continent features most of the playable areas, which include the Gold Saucer, an amusement park; Costa Del Sol, a seaside resort; the town of Nibelheim, which resides at the base of Mt. Nibel; Rocket Town, which is Cid's home and the location of Shinra's failed space program (which succeeds in-game); the village Wutai (on an island to the west); and a settlement constructed on a plateau called "Cosmo Canyon". The tribe inhabiting the canyon emphasize living in harmony with nature and dedicating causes to the planet's well-being.<ref name="cosmo">{{cite book | year=2005 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy VII Ultimania Ω | pages=217 | language=Japanese|publisher=Square Enix|id=ISBN 4-7575-1520-0}}</ref> Their settlement features an [[observatory]] and serves as a research facility for those who wish to participate in a philosophy known as "the Study of Planet Life", an environmentally conscious lifestyle that encourages utmost deference for nature and teaches that the planet has a life of its own.<ref name="cosmo"/> The northernmost continent is a heavily [[glacier|glaciated]] wasteland, and its few settlements include an excavation site; a ski resort (Icicle Inn in English versions); the mythical "City of the Ancients"; and the Northern Crater, where the game's [[climax]] takes place. There are also underwater locations accessible via submarine, such as the downed Gelnika, which was commissioned by Shinra to transport state-of-the-art weapons and materia to be used against the Weapons deployed by the planet itself when Meteor was summoned by Sephiroth, and the cave where a key needed for use in the City of the Ancients lies.

The game's character designer, Tetsuya Nomura, has expressed feelings that ''Final Fantasy VII'' was hindered by graphical limitations, and that his designs were, consequently, very plain in comparison to his "true" style. However, he was able to find other means of expressing some of his ideas. Cloud's original character design called for slicked back black hair with no spikes, intended to serve as a contrast to Sephiroth's long, flowing silver hair. However, Nomura feared that such masculinity could prove to be unpopular with fans, and decided to give Cloud a unique feature that would emphasize his role in the game as the main character. He changed the design to feature Cloud's now trademark shock of spiky, bright blond hair. For Tifa's design, Nomura has admitted to facing a difficult decision in choosing to give her a miniskirt or pants. With input from other members of the game's development staff, he eventually selected a dark miniskirt, contrasted by Aeris' long, pink dress.

Vincent's character developed from horror researcher to detective, then to chemist, and finally to the figure of a former Turk with a tragic past. It has been explained that his crimson mantle was added to symbolize the idea of carrying a heavy weight on his shoulders associated with death. Nomura has indicated that Cid Highwind's fighting style resembles that of a [[Final Fantasy character classes#Dragoon|Dragon Knight]], a [[character class]] so chosen because his last name is the same as that of two previous dragon knights featured in the ''Final Fantasy'' series, Ricard Highwind of ''[[Final Fantasy II]]'' and Kain Highwind of ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]''.

Due to their popularity, several characters from the game have made [[cameo appearance]]s in other Square Enix titles, most notably the [[Versus fighting game|fighting game]] ''[[Ehrgeiz]]'' and the popular ''Final Fantasy''-[[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] crossover series ''Kingdom Hearts''. Sephiroth remains one of the most popular villains in video game history, unanimously voted #1 by the staff of gaming publication ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' in their "Top 10 Video Game Bosses" list in October 2005.<ref>{{cite book | year=2005 | editor=Editors of EGM magazine | title=Electronic Gaming Monthly October, 2005 | pages=72–73 | language=English | publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]}}</ref> During spring of the same year, Sephiroth won [[GameFAQs]]' best villain contest.<ref>{{cite web | title=Spring 2005: Got Villains? | url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/contest/spr05 | publisher=[[GameFAQs]] | accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref> In ''Game Informer''{{'}}s top ten Video Game Bosses list, Sephiroth received number three, behind Mother Brain of ''[[Super Metroid]]'' and [[List of Metal Gear Solid characters#Psycho Mantis|Psycho Mantis]] of ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]''.

===Story===
''Final Fantasy VII'' begins with Cloud joining a group called AVALANCHE in a series of raids against the Mako reactors surrounding the city of Midgar. Although the first mission is a success, AVALANCHE is trapped at another reactor during a subsequent raid. The reactor explodes, launching Cloud from the upper levels of Midgar into the slums below. He lands on a flower bed, where he is formally introduced to Aeris.<ref>'''Aeris:''' You okay? This is a church in the Sector 5 slums. [You] suddenly fell on top of me. You really gave me quite a scare. / '''Cloud:''' ……I came crashing down? / '''Aeris:''' The roof and the flower bed must have broken your fall. You're lucky. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy VII |developer=Square Co |publisher=SCE America |date=1997-09-07 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref> Prompted by the arrival of Shinra's Turks operatives sent to capture Aeris, Cloud agrees to be Aeris' bodyguard.<ref>'''Aeris:''' Say, Cloud.

They meet up with Tifa, and infiltrate the mansion of crime boss [[Characters of Final Fantasy VII#Don Corneo|Don Corneo]]. The party learns that Shinra has discovered the location of AVALANCHE's hideout and plans to collapse the upper plate of Sector 7 onto the slums below.<ref>'''Don Corneo:''' Shinra's trying to crush a small rebel group called AVALANCHE, and want to infiltrate their hideout.

President Shinra believes Aeris can lead him to the "Promised Land", a mythical land of fertility, where he expects to find Mako energy.<ref>'''President Shinra:''' She's the last surviving Ancient… Don't you know?

It's been said the Promised Land is very fertile. …If the land is fertile… / '''Barret:''' Then there's gotta be Mako! / '''President Shinra:''' Exactly.

The abundant Mako will just come out on its own. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy VII |developer=Square Co |publisher=SCE America |date=1997-09-07 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref>

The remaining members of AVALANCHE infiltrate Shinra's headquarters to rescue Aeris. After freeing her and Red XIII, they escape when most of the personnel in the building——including President Shinra——are killed. Finding the body of the president skewered by a long sword, Cloud suspects a man called Sephiroth has returned from his presumed death. Palmer, an executive spared during the massacre, claims to have witnessed Sephiroth murder the president and state that he would never allow Shinra to claim the Promised Land.<ref>'''Cloud:''' Did you see him?

The party is joined by Yuffie, Cait Sith, Vincent, and Cid. Each member of the group must come to terms with personal conflicts from their past. The full scope of Sephiroth's plan is eventually revealed: if the planet is significantly damaged, the Lifestream within will gather at the point of injury, attempting to heal the wound. Sephiroth intends to use a powerful spell called "Meteor" to fatally injure the planet, inciting a reaction in the Lifestream to heal the wound before it can cause the planet's destruction. Sephiroth would then merge with all the energy of the planet, granting him god-like power over it.<ref>'''Aeris:''' How do you intend to become one with the Planet? / '''Sephiroth:''' It's simple.

The amount of energy gathered depends on the size of the injury. …What would happen if there was an injury that threatened the very life of the Planet? Think how much energy would be gathered! Ha ha ha. And at the center of that injury, will be me. All that boundless energy will be mine. By merging with all the energy of the Planet, I will become a new life form, a new existence.

At an ancient temple created by the Cetra, AVALANCHE attempts to undermine Sephiroth's plot by claiming the Black Materia needed to activate Meteor, but Sephiroth displays a mysterious power over Cloud, forcing him to relinquish it. Fearing Sephiroth may cast Meteor, Aeris sets off to stop him on her own. AVALANCHE follows her to the northern continent, where the they enter an ancient Cetra city. After finding Aeris praying to the planet for aid, Sephiroth begins affecting Cloud's behavior, and attempts to force him to kill her.

Cloud, however, is beginning to doubt his ability to control his own actions.

This collision formed a large [[impact crater]], grievously harming the planet.<ref>{{cite book | year=2005 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy VII Ultimania Ω | pages=214, 587 | language=Japanese | publisher=Square Enix | id=ISBN 4-7575-1520-0}}</ref> Jenova emerged from the crater, intending to infect all living organisms on the planet with a virus inducing insanity and monstrous transformations.<ref name="jenova">{{cite book | year=2005 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy VII Ultimania Ω | pages=210–215 | language=Japanese|publisher=Square Enix|id=ISBN 4-7575-1520-0}}</ref> Among its victims were most of the Cetra. Attempting to defend itself, the planet created giant monsters called "WEAPONs". The majority of humans fled rather than fight Jenova, however, a small group of Cetra survivors managed to defeat Jenova, confining it within the fissure created by its landing.<ref>'''Ifalna:''' A small number of the surviving Cetra defeated Jenova, and confined it. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy VII |developer=Square Co |publisher=SCE America |date=1997-09-07 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref> Eventually, the remains of Jenova would be unearthed by [[Characters of Final Fantasy VII#Professor Gast|Professor Gast]], a researcher for the Shinra Company. Mistaking the creature for a Cetra, Gast was given authorization to conduct an experiment to artificially produce a Cetra by combining cells from Jenova with the fetus of an unborn child.<ref name="jenova"/> Five years earlier, Sephiroth learned that he was the product of this experiment while on a Shinra mission in Cloud and Tifa's hometown, Nibelheim. He concluded that he was a Cetra who had been produced solely from Jenova's genetic material. He burned down Nibelheim, intending to kill all descendants of those he believed had abandoned his ancestors in the defense of the planet. Cloud confronted Sephiroth during this massacre, after which Sephiroth vanished under unknown circumstances and was presumed dead until his reappearance in the Shinra building. When AVALANCHE travels to the Northern Crater to confront Sephiroth, he tells Cloud that he was not in Nibelheim, showing him images of a 1st Class SOLDIER with dark hair who occupies Cloud's place in his memories.<ref>'''Cloud:''' Sephiroth! I know you're listening! I know what you want to say! That I wasn't in Nibelheim five years ago.

During the earthquake that follows, Cloud is separated from his companions and falls into the Lifestream.

As the meteor summoned by Sephiroth slowly approaches the planet, the Shinra Company focuses its efforts on protecting humanity from the WEAPONs.<ref name="defendingtheplanet"/> The members of AVALANCHE are interrogated and nearly executed. They escape from captivity in Junon and obtain Cid's airship, the "Highwind". They begin searching for Cloud, and discover Shinra's plan to take Huge Materia from the major spots of the world. They eventually find Cloud in a [[catatonia|catatonic]] state on a tropical resort called Mideel where he washed up following the casting of Meteor. Tifa resolves that she will not leave Mideel until Cloud has fully recovered. The WEAPONs' destructive activity causes the island to split open, depositing Cloud and Tifa into the Lifestream, where she reconstructs Cloud's memories and learns the truth about his past. It is revealed that Cloud never succeeded in joining SOLDIER and only managed to attain the rank of [[private (rank)|private]] in Shinra's military. The dark-haired SOLDIER from the images is called "[[Zack Fair|Zack]]" and was Aeris' first boyfriend. During Sephiroth's destruction of Nibelheim, Zack, Tifa, and Cloud fought him in the Mako reactor. Although Tifa and Zack were defeated, Cloud and Sephiroth severely wounded one another. After decapitating Jenova, Sephiroth is thrown into the Lifestream by Cloud, taking the creature's head with him. Rather than dying, his body and consciousness were crystallized in Mako inside Jenova's crater.

Cloud and Zack were among the wounded survivors who were apprehended by Shinra as part of a [[cover-up]] of Sephiroth's massacre. Professor Hojo subjected these survivors to an experiment, performing the same enhancements given to SOLDIER members. However, all but Zack entered a [[coma]]tose state, and nearly five years later, Zack broke free from his confinement and took Cloud with him. The procedure for enhancing SOLDIER members involved Mako showers and the injection of Jenova cells. The alien cells inhabiting Cloud's body allowed his mind to construct a false persona, built around Zack's behavior, but they also allowed Sephiroth to modulate his behavior. The cells' ability to duplicate information, led Cloud to believe he had been the 1st Class SOLDIER in Nibelheim. Zack was killed outside Midgar by Shinra soldiers after saving Cloud's life. During Zack's final moments, he tells Cloud to live both of their lives. Afterward, Tifa discovered Cloud, who was wearing a 1st Class uniform which Zack gave him, and offered him a job with AVALANCHE.<ref name="jenova"/>

Before Cloud awakens, AVALANCHE stops Shinra from taking the Huge Materia. It is revealed that Aeris, in her final moments, was casting the spell "Holy" with the White Materia, the only means of opposing Meteor. Although she succeeded, Sephiroth prevented the spell from taking effect and has been restrained since. Deciding to protect humanity from the WEAPONs before approaching Sephiroth, Shinra and AVALANCHE destroy the WEAPONs, killing nearly all of Shinra's executives in the process. Among the few survivors are [[Characters of Final Fantasy VII#Reeve|Reeve Tuesti]], who is revealed to be the repentant controller of Cait Sith,<ref>{{cite book | year=2005 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy VII Ultimania Ω | pages=57 | language=Japanese | publisher=Square Enix | id=ISBN 4-7575-1520-0}}</ref> and Professor Hojo, who is revealed to be Sephiroth's biological father. He explains that he and his wife were assistants to Professor Gast, and offered up their unborn child as a test subject to research involving Jenova.<ref>{{cite book | year=2005 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy VII Ultimania Ω | pages=198 | language=Japanese | publisher=Square Enix | id=ISBN 4-7575-1520-0}}</ref> After finding out that Hojo is trying to help Sephiroth gain mastery over the Lifestream, AVALANCHE kill him. Cloud tells his team to go find what they are fighting for, before they begin a final assault against Sephiroth. With each member of Cloud's group at peace with his or her past, the group travels through the Northern Crater to the planet's core. They defeat Sephiroth and free Holy, but the spell is unable to destroy Meteor alone. Selected as Meteor's target, Midgar is almost completely destroyed. However, the Lifestream rises from the planet to aid Holy and destroys it.<ref>{{cite book | year=2005 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy VII Ultimania Ω | pages=591 | language=Japanese | publisher=Square Enix | id=ISBN 4-7575-1520-0}}</ref> During the following epilogue, Red XIII runs through a canyon with two cubs at his side.

==Development and release==
===SNES project and early development===
Planning sessions for ''Final Fantasy VII'' began in 1994 after the release of ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]''. At the time, the game was planned to be another 2D project for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Editors of Level magazine | |year=2008 |month=May |title=Yoshinori Kitase interview |journal=Level |volume= |issue=25 |pages= | publisher=Reset Media |id= |language=Swedish |accessdate=2008-08-11}}</ref> Series creator [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]] intended the story to take place in modern [[New York City]] in the year 1999. Several of the staff members were working in parallel on ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'', and development for ''Final Fantasy VII'' was interrupted when the other project became important enough to require the help of [[Yoshinori Kitase]] and other designers. Some of the ideas originally considered for ''Final Fantasy VII'' ended up in ''Chrono Trigger'' instead. Other ideas, such as the New York setting and the sorceress character [[Characters of Final Fantasy VIII#Edea|Edea]], were kept unused until the later projects ''[[Parasite Eve (video game)|Parasite Eve]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'' respectively.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bjarneby |first=Tobias |year=2006 |month=April |title=De missanpassade |journal=Level |volume= |issue=1 |pages=38–46 | publisher=Reset Media |id= |language=Swedish|accessdate=2008-08-11}}</ref>

===Nintendo 64 project and ''Final Fantasy SGI''===
{{seealso|Final Fantasy VI#Interactive CG Game}}
At its conception, the original script of ''Final Fantasy VII'', written by Hironobu Sakaguchi, was completely different from the finished product. Tetsuya Nomura recalled how Sakaguchi "wanted to do something like a detective story." The first part of the story involved a character named "Hot Blooded Detective Joe" who was in pursuit of the main characters. The main characters managed to blow up the city of Midgar, which had already been developed for the story.<ref>{{cite web| title= FFVII Not Being Remade -- Nomura| publisher=[[IGN]]|author=IGN Staff|date=2007-06-04|accessdate=2008-04-15|url= http://ps3.ign.com/articles/793/793956p1.html}}</ref>

Development of ''Final Fantasy VII'' resumed in late 1995,<ref name="development3">{{cite book | year=2003 | editor=Editors of Edge magazine | title=Edge May 2003; issue 123 | pages=108–113 | language=English | publisher=Future Publishing}}</ref> and required the efforts of more than one hundred artists and programmers<ref>{{cite web | last=Vestal|first=Andrew | title=The History of Final Fantasy | url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/vgs/universal/finalfantasy_hs/sec1_7_2.html | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref> using such software as [[PowerAnimator]] and [[Softimage 3D|Softimage|3D]],<ref name="development3"/> and a budget of approximately [[United States dollar|US$]]45 million. ''Final Fantasy VI''{{'}}s co-director and scenario writer, Yoshinori Kitase, returned to direct and co-write ''Final Fantasy VII'' and was concerned the franchise might be left behind if it did not catch up to the [[3D computer graphics]] used in other games at the time.<ref name="development5">{{cite book | year=2005 | editor=Editors of Electronic Gaming Monthly | title=Electronic Gaming Monthly October 2005; issue 196 | pages=104|language=English|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]}}</ref>

Development began after the production of a short, experimental [[tech demo]] called "''[[Final Fantasy VI#Interactive CG Game|Final Fantasy SGI]]''" for [[Silicon Graphics, Inc.]] Onyx workstations. The demo featured [[polygon (computer graphics)|polygon]]-based 3D renderings of characters from ''Final Fantasy VI'' in a [[real time (media)|real time]] battle and incorporated interactive elements.<ref name="development6">{{cite web | last=Sutherland|first=Kenny| title=Elusions: Final Fantasy 64 | url=http://www.lostlevels.org/200510/ | publisher=Lost Levels | accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref><ref name="development7">{{cite web | title=Final Fantasy SGI Demo | url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/ff/affw/ffsgi.html | publisher=[[RPGamer]]|accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref> This experiment led the development team to integrate these design mechanics into ''Final Fantasy VII.'' However, as a result of the high quantity of memory storage required to implement the motion data, 3D models, and [[computer graphics]] effects involved, only the [[CD-ROM]] format would be able to suit the project's needs.<ref name="development3"/><ref name="development6"/> [[Nintendo]], for which Square had developed all previous titles in the ''Final Fantasy'' series, had decided to continue to use [[cartridge (electronics)|cartridges]] for its upcoming [[Nintendo 64]] console. This eventually led to a dispute that resulted in Square ending its long, often tumultuous, relationship with Nintendo, and Square announced on [[January 12]], [[1996]] it would be developing ''Final Fantasy VII'' for [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]]'s [[PlayStation]] platform.<ref name="development3"/><ref name="development6"/>

In early August 1996, a demonstration disc called ''Square's Preview Extra'' was released in Japan as a bonus pack-in with the Playstation video game [[Tobal #1]]. The disc contained the earliest playable demo of ''Final Fantasy VII'' and video previews of other upcoming games such as [[Bushido Blade]] and [[Saga Frontier]]. The demo allowed players to play through the first part of Midgar. However, there were some noticeable differences from the final version, namely the presence of Aeris in the initial party and the ability to use Summons.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Square's Preview Extra |developer=Square Co |publisher=SquareSoft |date=1996-08-06 |platform=PlayStation |language=Japanese}}</ref> Tobal #1 and the Square Preview Extra disc were released in North America in late September of the same year. Later, a slightly different version of the demo was released which replaced Aeris with Tifa and included a different Summon.

===Changes from past installments===
The transition from [[2D computer graphics]] to 3D environments overlaid on [[pre-rendered]] backgrounds<ref name="ignreview"/><ref name="gamespotreview"/> was accompanied by a focus on a more realistic presentation, which challenged the development team. According to Kitase, "Right from the time the decision to go with CD was made he <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Game producer|producer]] [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]]] set down a ground rule for the team saying, 'If the player becomes aware of the access times, we have failed'", demanding that an engrossing atmosphere be upheld, which led to the programming of various animations to activate while the game loaded data.<ref name="development3"/> While the extra storage capacity and computer graphics, to which the team now had access, gave them the means to implement more than 40 minutes of [[full motion video]] movies<ref name="development3"/>—an unprecedented undertaking in the genre at the time<ref name="development3"/>—this innovation brought with it the added difficulty of ensuring that the inferiority of the in-game graphics in comparison to the full motion video sequences was not too obvious. Kitase has described the process of making the in-game environments as detailed as possible to be "a daunting task".<ref name="development3"/>

Among the difficulties faced was the potential inability to render 3D polygon models based on the designs of [[Yoshitaka Amano]], the series' long-time character designer. As his style was considered too exquisite to be compatible with the visual format of the project, this issue was addressed by bringing Tetsuya Nomura on board as the project's main artist, while Amano aided in the design of the game's world map. Previously a monster designer for ''[[Final Fantasy V]]'', Nomura's style was more reminiscent of [[manga]] and was considered easier to adapt. Another development problem was a rushed production schedule. Veteran series [[composer]] [[Nobuo Uematsu]] commented in the liner notes of the game's soundtrack: "There is one thing common in all the ''Final Fantasy'' games. None of them are complete". Despite delaying the game's release from December 1996 to January 1997, several additions to gameplay and story needed to be made for the game's North American release,<ref name="gamespotreview"/> prompting a re-release in Japan under the title "''Final Fantasy VII International''".

===Design and inspirations===
Art director [[Yusuke Naora]] refers to the game's atmosphere as "strong [and] dark", achieved through lighting effects he considers "the darkest of darkest", and a story that emphasised realism while drawing on a variety of myths, legends, and religious and philosophical systems to "[use] as a framework for loftier ethical aspirations and ecologically conscious evangelism".<ref name="development5"/><ref name="development3"/> These concepts were reflected in names, such as "Sephiroth",<ref>{{cite book | year=1997 | editor=Famitsu | title=Final Fantasy VII Kaitai Shinsho | pages=26 | language=Japanese | publisher=Famitsu | id=ISBN 4-7577-0098-9}}</ref> Cloud's personal conflicts, the permanence of Aeris' death and the plot element of the Lifestream.<ref name="development3"/><ref name="development5"/> Tetsuya Nomura has explained that, during the early stages of development, the game's original design featured only Cloud, Barret and Aeris, with the intention that one of the three would die.<ref name="development5"/> Feeling Cloud could not die, due to his leading role, and the death of characters such as Barret was already too great a cliché in the ''Final Fantasy'' series and fiction in general, he expressed frustration with the frequent presentation of death in fiction as an awe-inspiring, often romantic idea centered around sacrifice and resurrection. As a result, Nomura suggested Aeris die and not return, believing the audience would not expect such a development, and it would emphasise the sudden, harsh, and irreversible nature of death.<ref name="development5"/><ref name="development3"/> Alternatively, Sakaguchi based the philosophy of the Lifestream on ideas from cultures that believe in an invisible, inextinguishable energy that permeates planets and all life upon them, and was given its in-game representation by Kitase.<ref name="development3"/>

Members of the development team have revealed they intended some aspects of the game's story to be left open to the interpretation of individual players. Scenario writer [[Kazushige Nojima]] explained he intended players to feel encouraged to speculate about what Cloud might be thinking in certain situations rather than be provided with actual insight into what he felt.<ref name="scifisetting"/><ref name="development3"/> The game's ending left the fate of the characters ambiguous until the release of ''[[Final Fantasy VII Advent Children]]'' in 2005,<ref name="development12">{{cite book | year=2001 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy X Ultimania Ω | pages=191 | language=Japanese | publisher=DigiCube/Square Enix | id=ISBN 4-88787-021-3}}</ref><ref name="rpgamer">{{cite web | author=Alley, Jake | title=Final Fantasy VII—Review | url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/ff/ff7/reviews/ff7strev1.html | publisher=[[RPGamer]] | accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref> but the ultimate fate of humanity remained unclear nonetheless. At the time of ''Advent Children''{{'}}s release, Kitase suggested the game's epilogue may signify the extinction of human beings.<ref name="development5"/> However, Nomura has since stated the game's final scene symbolizes humans living in harmony with nature,<ref>{{cite book | year=2006 | editor=Watanabe, Yukari | title=Final Fantasy VII Advent Children—Reunion Files - | pages=105 | language=Japanese|publisher=SoftBank|id=ISBN 4-7973-3498-3}}</ref> and Square has provided explanations for other details of the game's plot with the publication of the ''Final Fantasy VII [[Ultimania]] Ω'' guidebook.

===North American release===
The game's release in North America was preceded by a massive three-month marketing campaign, for which Sony allocated a US$100 million budget. The high-profile campaign consisted of three 30-second television commercials on major networks, a holiday promotion with [[Pepsi]], and printed ads in publications such as ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[Details (magazine)|Details]]'', ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'', ''[[Playboy]]'' and [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] and [[DC Comics|DC]].<ref>{{cite web | date=August 1997 | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1997_August_27/ai_19701566 | title=PlayStation's Final Fantasy VII Marketing Blitz Continues | publisher=Find Articles; originally published in [[Business Wire]] | accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref> In 1998, ''Final Fantasy VII'' was [[porting|ported]] to [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]-based [[personal computer|PCs]].

==Audio==
{{main|Music of Final Fantasy VII}}
The soundtrack for ''Final Fantasy VII'' was composed by [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. Instead of recorded music and sound effects for the game, Uematsu opted for [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDIs]], using the PlayStation's own internal [[sound chip]]. He has explained he chose this method because it allowed the console's CPU to process audio data quicker, which in turn allowed it to focus more on processing the game's 3D engine and to prevent noticeable load times. The game was originally intended to feature a [[vocal music|vocal piece]], but this was cut due to the limitations imposed by recorded audio. However, a song with synthesized choral backing is heard in "[[One-Winged Angel]]".

The game's soundtrack was commercially released on four [[compact disc]]s;<ref>{{cite web |title=SQUARE ENIX MUSIC | url=http://na.square-enix.com/music/tunes/ff7.html | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060717233408/http://na.square-enix.com/music/tunes/ff7.html | archivedate=2006-07-17 | publisher=Square Enix North America | accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author=Schweitzer, Ben; Gann, Patrick | title=Final Fantasy VII OST | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ff7ost/index.html | publisher=[[RPGFan]]|accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref> a single-disc album of selected tracks from the Original Soundtrack and three selected [[arrangement|arranged]] tracks, entitled "''[[Final Fantasy VII: Reunion Tracks]]''", was released separately.<ref>{{cite web | title=SQUARE ENIX MUSIC | url=http://na.square-enix.com/music/tunes/reunion.html | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061109062521/http://na.square-enix.com/music/tunes/reunion.html | archivedate=2006-11-09 | publisher=Square Enix North America | accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author=Gann, Patrick | title=Final Fantasy VII Reunion Tracks | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ff7reunion/index.html | publisher=[[RPGFan]] | accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref> A piano-only arrangement of selected tracks was also produced,<ref>{{cite web | author=Gann, Patrick | title=Piano Collections Final Fantasy VII | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ff7piano/index.html | publisher=[[RPGFan]] | accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref> and several remixed versions of tracks from the game have surfaced in subsequent Square productions, including ''Final Fantasy VII Advent Children''<ref>{{cite web | last=Castro|first=Juan | title=Final Fantasy VII Advent Children | url=http://psp.ign.com/articles/656/656519p1.html | publisher=[[IGN]] |date=2005-10-06| accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author=Gann, Patrick | title=Final Fantasy VII Advent Children OST | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ff7ac/index.html | publisher=[[RPGFan]] | accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref> and ''Kingdom Hearts''.<ref>{{cite web | author=Gann, Patrick | title=Kingdom Hearts -Final Mix- Additional Tracks | url=http://rpgfan.com/soundtracks/khfm/index.html | publisher=[[RPGFan]] | accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref>

==Reception==
''Final Fantasy VII'' was both a critical and commercial success, and set several sales records. Within three days of its January 1997 release in Japan, the game had sold 2.3 million copies.

The game received extremely favorable reviews from many well-known gaming publications. ''[[GameFan]]'' called it "quite possibly the greatest game ever made", while [[GameSpot]] commented "never before have technology, playability, and narrative combined as well as in ''Final Fantasy VII''", expressing particular favor toward the game's graphics, audio and story. The UK-based publication ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' gave the game a 9/10, and ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' granted a 9.5/10, claiming "No other RPG can pull off a cinematic experience like ''Final Fantasy VII''".{{Fact|date=July 2008}} At the time of release, multimedia website [[IGN]] insisted ''Final Fantasy VII''{{'}}s "graphics are light years beyond anything ever seen on the PlayStation", held its plot "is deep … and epic", and regarded its battle system as its strongest point.<ref name="ignreview"/> One [[RPGamer]] staff reviewer praised the game's soundtrack "both in variety and sheer volume", suggesting that "Uematsu has done his work exceptionally well" and "is perhaps at his best here".<ref>{{cite web | author=Castomel | title=Final Fantasy VII—Review | url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/ff/ff7/reviews/ff7strev3.html | publisher=[[RPGamer]] | accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref>

''Final Fantasy VII'' has received negative criticism as well. [[GameSpy]] rated it seventh on their "25 Most Overrated Games" list in September 2003, saying, "Most ''FF'' aficionados will tell you ''VII'', while very good, is hardly the best game in the series", two of the reviewers placing both ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' above it.<ref>{{cite web | author=GameSpy Staff | title=Top 25 Most Overrated Games | url=http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/september03/25overrated/index20.shtml | publisher=[[GameSpy]] | accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref> While giving the game an overall 5/5, ''[[Official PlayStation Magazine|Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine]]'' questioned the game's highly linear progression,<ref name="1UP">{{cite web | title=Final Fantasy VII Review | url=http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3111181&did=3 | publisher=[[1UP.com]]|author=1UP Staff|date=2000-01-01|accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref> as did GameSpot.<ref name="gamespotreview"/> ''OPM'' considered the game's translation "a bit muddy, causing unnecessary confusion and clouding the fine story", sentiments echoed by one member of RPGamer's staff who suggested "[the game] is far from perfect", citing its translation as "packed with typos and other errors which further obscure what is already a very confusing plot".<ref name="rpgamer"/> ''[[GamePro]]'' also considered the [[Japanese language|Japanese]]-to-[[English language|English]] translation a significant weakness in the game,<ref name="development17"/> and IGN regarded the option to use only three characters at a time as "the game's only shortcoming".<ref name="ignreview"/> Overall, the game has earned a 92% universal approval rating from critics on [[Metacritic]] and [[Game Rankings]].<ref name="MC">{{cite web | title=Final Fantasy VII (psx: 1997): Reviews | url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/psx/finalfantasy7?q=Final%20Fantasy%20VII | publisher=[[Metacritic]] | accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref><ref name="GR">{{cite web | title=Final Fantasy VII Reviews | url=http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/197341.asp?q=Final%20Fantasy%20VII | publisher=[[Game Rankings]] | accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref>

The game has also been the subject of criticism from parents concerned with violence in video games, particularly in the wake of the [[Columbine High School massacre]] in 1999. Following the event, several parents of children murdered in the massacre filed a US$5 billion lawsuit against companies that published and developed video and computer games. Among the co-defendants were [[Eidos Interactive]], publisher of the PC version of the game, with ''Final Fantasy VII'' cited as their offending contribution.<ref>{{cite web | date=June 2001 | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20010607/ai_n14390475 | title=School massacre families to sue creators of violent games | publisher=Find Articles; originally published in ''[[The Independent]]'' | accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref>

===Legacy===

''Final Fantasy VII'' is credited with allowing console RPGs to find a place in markets outside Japan, and remains arguably the most popular title in the ''Final Fantasy'' series.<ref name="mainstream"/><ref name="mainstream2"/> In January 2005, it was selected by ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' as 6<sup>th</sup> on their list of "the 10 most important games … that helped redefine the industry since … 1989". Citing its "beautiful cut-scenes and a deep, introspective narrative", they claimed that "Square’s game was … the first RPG to surpass, instead of copy, movie-like storytelling." In late 2007, ''[[Dengeki PlayStation]]'' named ''Final Fantasy VII'' as the best story, best RPG, and best overall game in their retrospective awards feature about the original [[PlayStation]].<ref>{{cite web | author=Gantayat, Anoop | date=2007-11-22 | title=Nomura Talks FFXIII | url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/837/837350p1.html | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref>

The game's popularity and open-ended nature also led the director and writer to establish a plot-related connection between ''Final Fantasy VII'' and ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'', another popular ''Final Fantasy'' title.<ref name="development12"/> It has also inspired an [[Final Fantasy VII (Famicom)|unofficial version of ''Final Fantasy VII'']] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Nintendo Famicom]] by Chinese company Shenzhen Nanjing Technology.<ref name="NESFFVII">{{cite web|url= http://www.joystiq.com/2008/02/22/final-fantasy-vii-ported-to-the-famicom-finally/|title=Final Fantasy VII ported to the Famicom.

The game's legacy includes the acceptance and standard inclusion of full-motion video sequences in RPGs, as well as significant advancement in computer graphics. These developments would allow series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi to begin production of the first ''Final Fantasy'' film, ''[[Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within]]''.<ref>{{cite book | year=2001 | editor=Kennedy, Sam & Steinman, Gary | title=Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine August 2001; issue 47 | pages=90 | language=English | publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]}}</ref> The game also introduced settings dominantly suffused with modern-to-advanced technology into the ''Final Fantasy'' series, a theme continued by ''Final Fantasy VIII'' and ''The Spirits Within''.<ref name="scifisetting"/><ref>{{cite web | last=Oliver|first=Glen | date=2001-07-11 | url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/301/301291p1.html | title=Review of Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref> Re-releases of Square games in Japan with bonus features would occur frequently after the release of ''Final Fantasy VII International''.

''Compilation of Final Fantasy VII'' is the formal title for a series of games and animated features developed by Square Enix based in the world and continuity of ''Final Fantasy VII''. Spearheaded by Tetsuya Nomura and Yoshinori Kitase,<ref>{{cite web | last=Kohler|first=Chris | date=2004-09-24 | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/dirgeofcerberusfinalfantasyvii/news.html?sid=6108651 | title=More Compilation of Final Fantasy VII details | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | date=2003-10-10 | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/rpg/kingdomhearts2/news.html?sid=6076646 | title=Kingdom Hearts II's Tetsuya Nomura Q & As | publisher=[[GameSpot]] |author=GameSpot Staff| accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | year=2005 | editor=V-Jump | title=Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Prologue | pages=50 | language=Japanese | publisher=Shueisha | id=ISBN 4-08-779339-7}}</ref> the series consists of several titles across various platforms, all of which are extensions of the ''Final Fantasy VII'' story.

Though not under the ''Compilation'' label, two novellas set within ''Final Fantasy VII''{{'}}s continuity have been produced, while a third ''Final Fantasy VII'' mobile game has also been developed. The first of the two novellas is ''[[Aerith Gainsborough#Maiden who Travels the Planet|Maiden who Travels the Planet]]''. It follows Aerith's journey in the Lifestream following her death at the hands of Sephiroth, taking place concurrently with the second half of ''Final Fantasy VII''.<ref>{{cite book | year=2005 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy VII Ultimania Ω | pages=572 | language=Japanese | publisher=Square Enix | id=ISBN 4-7575-1520-0}}</ref> The second novella, ''[[Final Fantasy VII Advent Children#On the Way to a Smile|On the Way to a Smile]]'', is a 3 part story based on the events that immediately followed the end of the game, with one part narrated from Tifa's perspective, one narrated from Barret's perspective, and the other narrated from that of a boy named "Denzel", orphaned after Shinra crushed Sector 7.<ref>{{cite book | year=2005 | editor=V-Jump | title=Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Prologue | pages=3 | language=Japanese | publisher=Shueisha | id=ISBN 4-08-779339-7}}</ref> These short stories have been released in North America in the "Limited Edition Collector's Set" of ''Final Fantasy VII Advent Children'' as "''The Novel''" under the names (in order) "Barret", "Denzel", and "Tifa". Finally, ''Final Fantasy VII Snowboarding'', released in North America in 2005, is a mobile [[porting|port]] of the snowboarding [[minigame]] featured in the original game.<ref>{{cite web | last=Buchanan|first=Levi | date=2005-03-10 | title=Final Fantasy VII Snowboarding | url=http://wireless.ign.com/articles/594/594902p1.html | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref> The game is playable on the LG VX8000, LG VX8100, Audiovox 8940 and Samsung A890 [[mobile phone]] and contains different tracks than the original minigame.

Some speculate that the ''Compilation'' will also include an [[enhanced remake]] of the original ''Final Fantasy VII'' for the PlayStation 3. This speculation was sparked at the 2005 Electronic Entertainment Expo by the release of a ''Final Fantasy VII'' tech demo featuring the opening sequence of ''Final Fantasy VII'' recreated using the PlayStation 3's graphical capabilities.<ref name="demo">{{cite book | year=2005 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy VII Ultimania Ω | pages=571 | language=Japanese | publisher=Square Enix | id=ISBN 4-7575-1520-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | year=2005 | editor=Editors of Electronic Gaming Monthly | title=Electronic Gaming Monthly October 2005; issue 196 | pages=106 | language=English | publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]}}</ref><ref name="demo3">{{cite web | last=Allen|first=Jason | date=2005-05-16 | title=E3 2005: Eyes-on the Final Fantasy VII Tech Demo | url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/614/614859p1.html | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref> The demo was created by Yoshinori Kitase's team with help from Koji Sugimoto, the main programmer for ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'', as well as [[Motomu Toriyama]], and was completed in one and a half months to Kitase's surprise and satisfaction, who nevertheless noted that it does not use the PlayStation 3's full capacities and could have been of even higher quality if more time had been given.<ref>{{cite web | author=Gantayat, Anoop | date=2005-06-10 | title=Yoshinori Kitase Talks Final Fantasy VII | url=http://psp.ign.com/articles/624/624504p1.html | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref>

Although Yōichi Wada explained that the presentation was intended only for technological demonstration purposes<ref name="demo3"/>—claims echoed by Kitase in an interview in ''Final Fantasy VII Ultimania Ω''<ref name="demo"/>—the June 2006 issue of ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' stated that the video was actually a "sneak peak at a next-gen revival" of ''Final Fantasy VII''.<ref>{{cite book | year=2006 | editor=Editors of Electronic Gaming Monthly | title=Electronic Gaming Monthly June 2006; issue 204 | pages=76 | language=English | publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]}}</ref> An official statement from Square Enix later debunked this claim, reiterating that the company had not announced such a project.<ref>{{cite web | last=Dunham|first=Jeremy | date=2006-05-23 | title=Square Enix Responds to PS3 FF7 Rumors | url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/709/709775p1.html | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author=Sloderbeck, Matt | date=2006-05-27 | title=Square Enix Denies Remake Rumors | url=http://www.rpgamer.com/news/Q2-2006/052706a.html | publisher=[[RPGamer]] | accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref> Further fueling the rumors, Kaz Hirai said at the Final Fantasy VII 10th Anniversary Gallery in Tokyo: "Congratulations on 10 fantastic years!

In an interview conducted with Square-Enix's Hajime Tabata, he states that the 'Compilation of Final Fantasy VII' series has not been completed with the release of the 'Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII' game for the Sony PSP and that "the Compilation's finale will take some other form".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psxextreme.com/ps3-news/2767.html|accessdate=2008-07-16|title=PS3 news: FFVII remake rumour resurrected|publisher=PSX Extreme}}</ref>

At the Square Enix Party event of May 2007, [[Suntory]] unveiled a drink named "''Final Fantasy VII'' [[Common elements of Final Fantasy#Items|Potion]]", produced to celebrate ''Final Fantasy VII'''s 10th anniversary.
