The [[United Kingdom]] entered the [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest]] three times, and the broadcaster is [[ITV]]. They have been more successful in this than in the Eurovision Song Contest lately.

[[Tom Morley]] (2003) and [[Cory Spedding]] (2004) sang both for the peace in the world and [[Joni Fuller]] (2005) described her feelings. The UK withdrew in 2006 due to low ratings. The BBC, Channel 4 and S4C had no intention of broadcasting the contest, this meant that the UK was absent from a Eurovision contest for the first time since 1958.

The UK holds the third highest number of total points: 140 points in 2004. The results of the partipication has been successful. They have taken a 2nd place as well as 3rd place. Due to low viewing figures, ITV withdrew from [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2006|JESC 2006]].

The Welsh broadcaster [[S4C|Sianel Pedwar Cymru (S4C)]] had shown interest in participating for the UK in 2008, hoping to share the [[Welsh language]] with a wider audience. The contest would therefore be a bilingual broadcast that would be broadcast in Wales on analogue, and on [[S4C Digidol]] in the rest of the UK. In the end, S4C chose not to broadcast the contest.

They are unlikely to return in 2009.
