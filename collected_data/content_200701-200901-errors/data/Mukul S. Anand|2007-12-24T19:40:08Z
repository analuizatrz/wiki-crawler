The film which first brought him recognition was the epic film ''[[Sultanat]]'' (1986), a film which brought together real-life father and son [[Dharmendra]] and [[Sunny Deol]] and introduced actress [[Juhi Chawla]].

His last completed film was ''[[Trimurti (film)|Trimurti]]'' (1995) which had a multi starcast including [[Jackie Shroff]], [[Anil Kapoor]] and [[Shahrukh Khan]] but failed to do well at the box office becoming one of his biggest flops. The last film he was working on at the time of his death was the much-hyped action adventure film ''[[Dus (1997 film)|Dus]]'' which remained incomplete and unreleased after his death although the film's music did end up releasing.
