The '''Most Serene Republic of San Marino''' {{Audio-IPA|en-us-San Marino.ogg|/ˌsæn məˈriːnoʊ/}} ({{lang-it|Serenissima Repubblica di San Marino}}) is a country in the [[Apennine Mountains]].  It is a [[landlocked country|landlocked]] [[Enclave and exclave|enclave]], completely surrounded by [[Italy]]. One of the [[European microstates]], San Marino has the smallest population of all the members of the [[Council of Europe]].

San Marino is the oldest sovereign state and constitutional [[republic]] in the world, having been founded on 3 September 301 by [[Saint Marinus|Marinus]] of [[Rab]], a [[Christian]] [[Stonemasonry|stonemason]] fleeing the [[Persecution of early Christians in the Roman Empire|religious persecution]] of [[Roman Emperor]] [[Diocletian]]. San Marino's constitution of 1600 is the world's oldest constitution still in effect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.loc.gov/law/help/guide/nations/sanmarino.html|accessdate=2008-05-21|title=Guide to Law Online: San Marino|author=Law Library of United States Congress}}</ref>

==History==  
{{main|History of San Marino}}
[[Image:Montale.JPG|thumb|left|Montale tower on [[Monte Titano]].]]
According to tradition, [[Saint Marinus]] left the  island of [[Rab]] in [[Croatia]] with his lifelong friend Leo and went to the town of [[Rimini]] as a mason. After persecution because of his Christian sermons, he escaped to the nearby [[Monte Titano]], where he built a small church and thus founded what is now the city and the state of San Marino. The official date of foundation of the Republic is 3 September 301.

By the mid-5th century, a community was formed; because of its relatively inaccessible location and its poverty, it has succeeded, with a few brief interruptions, in maintaining its independence. In 1631 its independence was recognized by the [[Papacy]].

[[Image:Garibaldi a San Marino.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Bust of [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] in San Marino, the first monument in the world dedicated to the "Hero of the Two Worlds". The work of Stefano Galletti, it was erected in 1882.]]

During the early phase of the [[Italian unification]] process in the 19th century, San Marino served as a refuge for numerous persons who were persecuted because of their support for the unification. In memory of this support, [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] accepted the wish of San Marino not to be incorporated into the new Italian state. [[Napoleon]] refused to take the country. When asked why, he allegedly commented, "Why? It's a model republic!" 

The government of San Marino made [[United States]] President [[Abraham Lincoln]] an honorary citizen.  He wrote in reply, saying that the republic proved that "government founded on republican principles is capable of being so administered as to be secure and enduring."<ref>[[Irving Wallace]], ''The Book of Lists 3''</ref>

In [[World War I]], Italy declared war on [[Austria-Hungary]] on 23 May 1915. San Marino declared war on Austria-Hungary on 3 June 1915.<ref>[http://www.firstworldwar.com/features/declarationsofwar.htm First World War.com - Feature Articles - Who Declared War and When<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

During WWII, San Marino initially declared war on Britain.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,764742,00.html]</ref> Then when Italy surrendered San Marino declared neutrality. September 21, 1944 San Marino declared war on Germany.<ref>[http://worldatwar.net/timeline/other/diplomacy39-45.html]</ref> 

The [[head of state]] is a committee (council) of two captains-regent. San Marino also had the world's first democratically-elected [[Communism|communist]] government, which held office between 1945 and 1957.

San Marino was the world's smallest republic from 301 to 1968, until [[Nauru]] gained independence.

San Marino became a member of the [[Council of Europe]] in 1988 and of the [[United Nations]] in 1992. It is not a member of the [[European Union]].

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of San Marino}}
[[Image:Monte Titano.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Mount Titano]].]]
San Marino is an [[enclave]] in Italy, on the border between the [[Regions of Italy|''regioni'']] of [[Emilia Romagna]] and [[Marche]]. Its topography is dominated by the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]] mountain range, and it has a rugged terrain. The highest point in the country, [[Monte Titano]], is situated at 749&nbsp;metres (2,457&nbsp;[[foot (length)|ft]]) above sea level. There are no bodies of water of any significant size.
San Marino is the third-smallest country in Europe, with only [[Vatican City]] and [[Monaco]] being smaller. San Marino has
no level natural land; 100% of the nation/state is built on top of the range.  

=== Climate ===

The [[climate]] is [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]], with warm summers and mild winters.
The National Center of Meteorology and Climatology of San Marino provides local forecasts. Proposed weather services for business and the public include Web cams and Online meteorological and climate data of San Marino.

=== Municipalities ===
[[Image:San Marino.png|thumb|[[Subnational|Administrative division]].]]
San Marino is divided into the following nine municipalities, known locally as ''Castelli'' -castles- (sing. ''castello'', each on a different hill, as depicted on the republic's coat of arms), that are also towns to the world. 

*'''[[San Marino, San Marino|The City of San Marino]]''' (''Città di San Marino'') is the capital. There are also eight minor municipalities: 

*'''[[Acquaviva, San Marino|Acquaviva]]'''
*'''[[Borgo Maggiore]]'''
*'''[[Chiesanuova]]'''
*'''[[Domagnano]]'''
*'''[[Faetano]]'''
*'''[[Fiorentino]]'''
*'''[[Montegiardino]]'''
*'''[[Serravalle, San Marino|Serravalle]]'''
The largest town of the Republic is [[Dogana]], which is not an autonomous Castello but rather belongs to the Castello of Serravalle.

Each castello, like Italian [[comune|''comuni'']], includes a main town that is the seat of the castello, called ''capoluogo'', and some even smaller localities known as ''[[frazione|frazioni]]''.

==Hamlets==
The republic is made up of 43 hamlets (named ''[[Curazia|curazie]]''):<br>
[[Cà Berlone]], [[Cà Chiavello]], [[Cà Giannino]], [[Cà Melone]], [[Cà Ragni]], [[Cà Rigo]], [[Cailungo]], [[Caladino]], [[Calligaria]], [[Canepa]], [[Capanne]], [[Casole]], [[Castellaro, San Marino|Castellaro]], [[Cerbaiola]], [[Cinque Vie]], [[Confine]], [[Corianino]], [[Crociale]], [[Dogana]], [[Falciano]], [[Fiorina, San Marino|Fiorina]], [[Galavotto]], [[Gualdicciolo]], [[La Serra]], [[Lesignano]], [[Molarini]], [[Montalbo, San Marino|Montalbo]], [[Monte Pulito]], [[Murata, San Marino|Murata]], [[Pianacci]], [[Piandivello]], [[Poggio Casalino]], [[Poggio Chiesanuova]], [[Ponte Mellini]], [[Rovereta]], [[San Giovanni sotto le Penne]], [[Santa Mustiola]], [[Spaccio Giannoni]], [[Teglio, San Marino|Teglio]], [[Torraccia]], [[Valdragone]], [[Valgiurata]] and [[Ventoso]].

== Politics ==
{{main|Politics of San Marino}}
[[Image:SAN MARINO-en.png|thumb|right|Map of San Marino]]
The politics of San Marino takes place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]], whereby the [[captain regent|Captains Regent]] are the [[head of state|heads of state]], and of a pluriform multi-party system. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the [[government]]. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the [[Grand and General Council]]. The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.

San Marino was originally led by the [[Arengo]], initially formed with the heads of each family. In the 13th century, power was given to the Great and General Council. In 1243, the first two [[captain regent|Captains Regent]] were nominated by the Council. This method of nomination is still in use today, {{As of|2008|lc=on}}. 

The legislature of the republic is the [[Grand and General Council]] (''Consiglio grande e generale'').  The Council is a unicameral legislature which has 60 members with elections occurring every 5 years under a proportional representation system in all nine administrative districts.  These districts (townships) correspond to the old [[parish]]es of the republic.  [[Citizen]]s eighteen years or older are eligible to vote.  Besides general legislation, the Grand and General Council approves the budget and elects the Captains Regent, the State Congress (composed of 10 Secretaries with executive power), the Council of Twelve (which forms the [[judicial branch]] during the period of legislature of the Council), the Advising Commissions, and the Government Unions.  The Council also has the power to ratify treaties with other countries. The Council is divided into five different Advising Commissions consisting of 15 councilors which examine, propose, and discuss the implementation of new laws that are on their way to being presented on the floor of the Council.
Every 6 months, the Council elects two Captains Regent to be the heads of state. The Regents are chosen from opposing parties so there is a balance of power. They serve a 6-month term. The investiture of the Captains Regent takes place on 1 April and 1 October in every year. Once this term is over, citizens have 3 days in which to file complaints about the Captains' activities. If they warrant it, judicial proceedings against the ex-head(s) of state can be initiated.

The practice of multiple heads of state, as well as the frequent re-election of the heads of state, are derived directly from the customs of the [[Roman Republic]]. The Council is equivalent to the [[Roman Senate]]; the Captains Regent, to the [[consul]]s of ancient [[Rome]].

If one gets elected to head of state, one may not refuse. If one
chooses to refuse, one is jailed.  

San Marino is a multi-party [[democratic]] [[republic]]. The two main parties are the [[San Marinese Christian Democratic Party]] (PDCS) and the [[Party of Socialists and Democrats]] (PSD, a merger of the [[Socialist Party of San Marino]] and the former communist [[Party of Democrats]]) in addition to several other smaller parties, such as the [[San Marinese Communist Refoundation]]. Due to the small size of San Marino and its low population, it is difficult for any party to gain a pure majority and most of the time the government is run by a coalition. In the June 2006 election the PSD won 20 seats on the Council and currently governs in coalition with the (liberal) [[Popular Alliance of Sammarinese Democrats for the Republic]] and [[United Left (San Marino)|United Left]].

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of San Marino}}
[[Image:Borgo maggiore.jpg|right|thumb|Borgo Maggiore]]
Although San Marino is not a [[European Union]] member, it is allowed to use the [[euro]] as its [[currency]] by arrangement with the [[Council of the European Union]]; it is also granted the right to use its own designs on the national side of the [[euro coins]]. Before the euro, the [[Sammarinese lira]] was pegged and exchangeable with the [[Italian lira]]. The small number of Sammarinese euro coins, as was the case with the lira before it, are primarily of interest to [[coin collecting|coin collectors]].

The [[tourism|tourist]] sector contributes over 50% of San Marino's [[Gross domestic product|GDP]], with more than 3.3 million tourists visiting in 1997.<ref>[http://www.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/s/11348.htm San Marino (11/98)]</ref> Other key [[industry|industries]] are [[bank]]ing, [[electronics]], and [[ceramic]]s. The main [[agriculture|agricultural]] products are [[wine]] and [[cheese]].

San Marino's [[postage stamp]]s, which are only valid for mail within the country, are mostly sold to [[philately|philatelists]] and are a source of income. San Marino is a member of the [[Small European Postal Administration Cooperation]].

The per capita level of output and standard of living are comparable to those of Italy, which supplies much of its food.

===Taxation===
[[Image:Sanmarino5.jpg|thumb|right|Photo of Guaita]]
The corporate profits tax rate in San Marino is 19 percent. Capital gains are subject to a five percent tax; interest is subject to a 13 percent withholding tax. 

In 1972, a valued added taxation (VAT) system was introduced in Italy, and was applied in San Marino, in accordance with the 1939 friendship treaty. In addition, a tax on imported goods, to be levied by San Marino, was established. Such taxes, however, were not, and are not, applied to national products. Until 1996, goods manufactured and sold in San Marino were not subject to indirect taxation.

Under the European Union customs agreement, San Marino continues to levy taxes, the equivalent of an import duty, on imported goods. Also, a general VAT was introduced, in replacement of the Italian VAT.

== Demographics ==
{{Main|Demographics of San Marino}}

The state has a population of approximately 29,000, including 1,000 foreigners, most of whom are Italians.  About 5,000 Sammarinese live in foreign countries, predominantly in Italy.

The language spoken is [[Italian language|Italian]]; [[Emiliano-Romagnolo]] is widely spoken, too. [[Roman Catholicism]] is the predominant religion.

==Military==
{{main|Military of San Marino}}
[[Image:Cerimonia Guardia di Rocca.jpg|thumb|The Guard of the Rock in dress uniform during the investiture of the new Captains Regent in the Piazza della Libertà.]]
San Marino has one of the smallest military forces in the world. National defence is, by arrangement, the responsibility of [[Military of Italy|Italy's armed forces]].  Different branches have varied functions including: performing ceremonial duties; patrolling borders; mounting guard at government buildings; and assisting police in major criminal cases. 

===Crossbow Corps===
Although once at the heart of San Marino's army, the Crossbow Corps is now a ceremonial force of approximately 80 volunteers. The Crossbow Corps since 1295 has provided demonstrations of crossbow shooting at festivals. Its uniform is medieval in design, and although a statutory military unit, it has no actual military function today.

===Guard of the Rock===
[[Image:Guard of the Rock.JPG|thumb|left|Three members of the Guard of the Rock]]
The [[Guardia di Rocca|Guard of the Rock]] is a front-line military unit in the San Marino armed forces, a state border patrol, with responsibility for patrolling borders and defending them. In their role as Fortress Guards they are responsible for guarding the Palazzo Pubblico in [[San Marino, San Marino|San Marino City]], the seat of national Government. In this role they are the forces most visible to tourists, and known for their colourful ceremony of [[Changing the Guard]]. Under the 1987 statute the Guard of the Rock are all enrolled as 'Criminal Police Officers' (in addition to their military role) and  assist the police in investigating major crime. The uniform of the Guard of the Rock is a distinctive red and green.

===Guard of the Council Great and General===
[[Image:San marino wache.jpg|thumb|Guard of the Council member]]
The Guard of the Council Great and General commonly known as The Guard of the Council or locally as the  'Guard of Nobles', formed in 1740, are a volunteer unit with ceremonial duties. Due to its striking blue, white and gold uniform, it is perhaps the best-known part of the Sammarinese military, and appears on countless postcard views of the republic. The functions of the Guard of the Council are to protect the [[Captains Regent]], and to defend the Great and General Council during its formal sessions. They also provide a ceremonial bodyguard to government officials on festivals of both state and church.

===The Army Militia===
In former times all families with two or more adult male members were required to enroll half of them in the Army Militia. This unit remains the basic fighting force of the armed forces of San Marino, but is largely ceremonial. It is a matter of civic pride for many San-Marinese to belong to the force, and all citizens with at least six years residence in the republic are entitled to enroll.

The uniform is dark blue, with a kepi bearing a blue and white plume. The ceremonial form of the uniform includes a white cross-strap, and white and blue sash, white epaulets, and white decorated cuffs.

===The Military Ensemble===
Formally this is part of the Army Militia, and is the ceremonial military band of San Marino. It consists of approximately 50 musicians. The uniform is similar to that of the Army Militia. Military Ensemble music accompanies most state occasions in the republic.

===The Gendarmerie===
Established in 1842, the [[Corps of Gendarmerie of San Marino|Gendarmerie]] of San Marino is a militarised law enforcement agency. Its members are full-time and have responsibility for the protection of citizens and property, and the preservation of law and order.

The entire military corps of San Marino depends upon the co-operation of full-time forces and their retained (volunteer) colleagues, known as the ''Corpi Militari Volontari'', or Voluntary Military Force.

== Transport ==
[[Image:San-Marino-Gondola-1283.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial tramway to [[Monte Titano]].]]
{{Main|Transport in San Marino}}
There are 220 km of [[highway]]s in the country, the main road being the [[San Marino Superhighway]].  Sammarinese authorities license private vehicles with distinctive licence plates which are white with blue figures and the coat of arms, usually a letter followed by up to four numbers.  Many vehicles also carry the international vehicle identification code (in black on a white oval sticker), which is "RSM".

There are no airports in San Marino, but there is an international [[heliport]] located in Borgo Maggiore. Most tourists who arrive by air land at [[Federico Fellini International Airport]] close to the city of [[Rimini]], then make the transfer by bus.

Two rivers flow through San Marino, but there is no major water transport, and no major port or [[harbour]].

===Public transport===

San Marino has limited public transport facilities. There is a regular [[bus]] service between [[Rimini]] and the city of San Marino, popular with both tourists and [[tourist industry]] workers commuting to San Marino from Italy. This service stops at approximately twenty locations in Rimini and within San Marino, with its two terminus stops at Rimini railway station and San Marino coach station, respectively.

A limited licensed taxi service operates nationwide. There are seven licensed taxi operating companies in the republic,<ref>Licensed taxi companies are listed on the [http://www.visitsanmarino.com/default.asp?id=114 Government tourism website].</ref> and Italian taxis regularly operate within San Marino when carrying passengers picked up in Italian territory.

There is a 1.5 km [[aerial tramway]] connecting the [[city]] of [[San Marino, San Marino|San Marino]] on top of [[Monte Titano]] with [[Borgo Maggiore]], a major town in the republic, with the second largest population of any Sammarinese settlement. For the visitor the aerial tramway gives the best views of Borgo Maggiore, as the cars sweep low over the rooftops of the main town square. From here a further connection is available to the nation's largest settlement, [[Dogana, San Marino|Dogana]], via the local bus service.
[[Image:San-marino-international-bus.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Sanmarinese international bus service link with Rimini, Italy.]]

Two aerial tramway cars, known as gondolas, and numbered '1' and '2', operate in opposition on a cable, and a service is provided at roughly fifteen minute intervals throughout the day. A third vehicle is available on the system, being a service car for the use of engineers maintaining the tramway.

===Railway===
Today there is no railway in San Marino, but for a short period prior to [[World War II]], it had a single narrow-gauge line, connecting the country with the Italian rail network at [[Rimini]]. Due the difficulties in accessing the capital, [[San Marino, San Marino|San Marino City]] (which has a mountain-top location), the terminus station was to be located at the village of [[Valdragone]] but was extended to reach the capital through a steep and winding track comprising many tunnels. The railway was opened on 12 June 1932.<ref>[http://ifef.free.fr/provo/if2005-6.pdf ''Internacia Fervojisto''] (''International Railways''), 2005.6, p85. In Esperanto</ref>
An advanced system for its time, it was an electric railway, powered from overhead cables. It was well built and well used, but was almost completely destroyed during [[WW II]]. Many facilities such as bridges, tunnels and stations remain visible today, and some have been converted to parks, public footpaths or traffic routes.

== Culture ==
[[Image:Marino als steinhauer.png|thumb|right|Illustration of [[Saint Marinus]], the founder of the Republic of San Marino, and prominent cultural figure.]]
The [[Three Towers of San Marino]]  are located on the three peaks of [[Monte Titano]] in the capital. They are depicted on both the [[Flag of San Marino]] and its [[Coat of Arms of San Marino|coat of arms]]. The three towers are: ''Guaita'', the oldest of the three (it was constructed in the eleventh century); the thirteenth-century ''Cesta'', located on the highest of Monte Titano's summits; and the fourteenth-century ''Montale'', on the smallest of Monte Titano's summits, still privately owned.

San Marino has a famous [[cake]] known as ''La Torta Di Tre Monti'' ("Cake of the Three Mountains/Towers"), similar to a layered wafer cake covered in [[Chocolate]].

[[Love Orchestra]], a Gian Luca "Luke" Mazza new age music project, comes from the Republic of San Marino. During concerts overseas, the San Marino flag is shown on the stage.

===University===

The ''Università degli Studi della Repubblica di San Marino'' ([[University of the Republic of San Marino]])<ref>[http://www.unirsm.sm/ Università degli Studi di San Marino]</ref> is the main university, in it there is the ''[[Scuola Superiore di Studi Storici in San Marino]]'' (Advanced School of Historical Studies), a distinguished research and advanced international study center. Other important institutes are the ''Istituto Musicale Sammarinese'' (Sammarinese Musical Institute)<ref>[http://www.ims.sm/ Istituto Musicale Sammarinese]</ref> and the [[Akademio Internacia de la Sciencoj San Marino]] or ''Accademia Internazionale delle Scienze San Marino'' (International Academy of Sciences San Marino).<ref>[http://www.ais-sanmarino.org/ Accademia Internazionale delle Scienze]</ref> The latter is known because it adopts the [[esperanto language]] as language for teaching and for scientific publications; further, because it makes a wide use of [[e-learning]].

===Sport===
{{main|Sport in San Marino}}
San Marino, along with [[Italy]], enjoy sports and [[football (soccer)]] is its most popular sport. Basketball and volleyball are also popular. The three sports have their own federations, the [[San Marino Football Federation]], the [[San Marino Basketball Federation]] and the [[Federazione Sammarinese Pallavolo|San Marino Volleyball Federation]].

The [[Campionato Sammarinese di Calcio|San Marino Championship]], founded under the auspices of the FSGC ([[San Marino Football Federation]]), is the premier footballing competition in San Marino. The fifteen teams that take part in the competition are split into two groups of eight and seven teams. The top three from each section at the end of the regular season progress into a semi-knockout style Championship Playoff. Prior to 2007, the playoff champion earned a spot in the preliminary rounds of the [[UEFA Cup]].  In 2007, [[UEFA]] granted San Marino a spot in the 1st Qualifying Round of the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]. The domestic cup winner also gets a spot in the UEFA Cup qualifying stages. 2007 league champions [[S.S. Murata]] was the first team to represent San Marino in the Champions League when they participated in the [[UEFA Champions League 2007-08|2007-08 competition]], losing to Finnish team [[Tampere United]]. San Marino also has a representative in the Italian system, with [[San Marino Calcio]] playing in the fourth tier of Italian football, [[Serie C2|Serie C2/B]]. San Marino play their home matches in the Sanmarinese at the [[Stadio Olimpico (Serravalle)|Stadio Olimpico]] of [[Serravalle, San Marino|Serravalle]].

The [[San Marino national football team]] played its first unofficial international match in 1986, in which it suffered a 0-1 defeat to the Canadian [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] team. Its first competitive outing was on 14 November 1990, a 0-4 loss against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] in the [[European Football Championship|European Championship]] qualifier. These defeats set the tone for most of the following outings of the team, who are regarded as easy victories in the qualifying sections of the European Championship and the [[Football World Cup|World Cup]].
[[Image:GP Imola2005 SchumiAlonso.jpg|thumb|left|2005 San Marino Grand Prix held in [[Imola]], Italy]]
They had a brief moment of glory when they faced [[England national football team|England]] in a World Cup qualifier on 17 November 1993 and took the lead through [[Davide Gualtieri]] after just 8.3 seconds - still the fastest goal in World Cup competition [http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A3952361]. Despite this goal, only San Marino's third at international level, the microstate went on to lose 7-1.

Until recently, San Marino's international record was one of almost total failure, with famous draws against [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] and [[Latvia national football team|Latvia]] being the only partial successes in an international career that contains over 70 defeats. However, on the 29 April 2004, San Marino recorded their first ever win, with a 1-0 victory over Liechtenstein in an international friendly. [[Andy Selva]] scored the only goal in a close game that finally gave this tiny republic a footballing victory.

On 6 September 2006, San Marino suffered their biggest ever defeat, losing 13-0 to world giants [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in the Stadio Olimpico. It was also the largest goal margin defeat in European Championship Qualifying history.
In the same competition on 7 February 2007, they came within 8 seconds of the best result in their history. They were level at 1-1 with the [[Republic of Ireland national soccer team|Republic of Ireland]] after 94 minutes when [[Stephen Ireland]] scored within 8 seconds of the final whistle. The goal scored by San Marino was their European Qualifying first goal since losing 4-1 to [[Austria national football team|Austria]] in 1998.

As of May 2008, San Marino is 200th in the [[FIFA World Rankings|FIFA world rankings]] - jointly last with seven other teams.

One of the [[Formula One]] races, the [[San Marino Grand Prix]], is named after the state, although it does not actually take place there.  It takes place at the [[Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari]] in the Italian town of [[Imola]], about 100 km northwest of San Marino, along the [[Via Emilia]].
The race was etched in infamy after two fatal accidents occurred at the [[1994 San Marino Grand Prix|1994 Grand Prix]], when [[Ayrton Senna]] and [[Roland Ratzenberger]] were killed.  The race was removed from the calendar for [[2007 Formula One season|2007]].

The [[San Marino and Rimini's Coast motorcycle Grand Prix]] was reinstated in the schedule in 2007 and takes place at the [[Misano World Circuit]].

[[Manuel Poggiali]] is one of San Marino's most winning sportsmen. He won 2 motorcycle World Championships, in 2001 with 125 cc bikes and in 2003 with 250 cc bikes.  Another San Marino successful motorcycle rider is [[Alex De Angelis]], a race winner in the 250 cc class and is currently racing in the premiere MotoGP class.

San Marino has a rather successful professional [[baseball]] team, [[San Marino (baseball team)|T & A San Marino]], which play in the top division of Italian professional baseball, the [[Serie A1 (baseball)|Serie A1]].  It has participated in the [[European Cup (baseball)|European Cup tournament]] for the top European professional baseball teams several times, hosting the event in 1996, 2000 and 2004, and scheduled to host in 2007.  It won the championship in [[2006 in baseball|2006]].

The long climb up to the top of San Marino has become a mecca for thousands of recreational road cyclists who train in nearby Misano every spring and autumn.

===Cuisine===
{{main|Cuisine of San Marino}}
The cuisine of San Marino is strongly similar to [[Italian cuisine|Italian]], especially that of the adjoining [[Emilia-Romagna]] and [[Marche]] regions, but it has a number of its own unique dishes and products. Its best known is probably the ''[[Torta Tre Monti]]'' ("Cake of the Three Mountains/Towers"), a chocolate layer cake depicting [[The Three Towers of San Marino]]. The country also has a small [[Sammarinese wine|wine]] industry.

==Music==

[[San Marino in the Eurovision Song Contest|San Marino]] entered the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] for the first time, in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008]], with the band [[Mi Odio|Miodio]] singing [[Complice]]. The group failed to make it to the Final from the first semi-final. San Marino gave its first ever highest (12) points to [[Greece in the Eurovision Song Contest|Greece]]. They were also one of only two countries - along with [[Ireland]] - to vote for the [[United Kingdom]]. The [[BBC]] subsequently published a magazine article on its website about San Marino, entitled "Britain's New Best Friend?" [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7421493.stm].
