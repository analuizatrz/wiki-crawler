'''''Green Wing''''' is an award winning [[United Kingdom|British]] [[television]] [[comedy]], set in a [[hospital]]. It was created by the same team as the [[Sketch comedy|sketch]] show ''[[Smack the Pony]]''.

Although set in [[East Hampton Hospital Trust]], there are few medical storylines; most of the action is generated by a series of [[soap opera]] and [[Commedia dell'arte]] style twists and turns in the personal lives of the characters. They proceed through a series of often absurd sketch-like scenes connected by [[lazzi]], or by sequences where the film is slowed down or sped up, often emphasising the [[body language]] of the characters.

The show has eight writers. Two series were made by [[talkbackTHAMES]] [[Film production|production]] company for [[Channel 4]]. At sixty minutes including advertisement time, the episodes are twice as long as is usual for a British comedy series.

The series ran between [[September 3]] and [[October 29]], [[2004]] and between [[31 March]] and [[19 May]] [[2006]]. A ninth episode was filmed with the second series, which was shown as a 90 minute long special [[4 January]] [[2007]] UK, but was shown in [[Australia]] and [[Belgium]] on [[29 December]] [[2006]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Green Wing News |work=British Sitcom Guide|url=http://www.sitcom.co.uk/green_wing/news.shtml|date=27th November 2006|accessdate=2007-01-04}}</ref> The dates of transmission shocked lead actress [[Tamsin Greig]], who said in a radio interview, "Channel 4 schedulers, where are they? Do they all live in Australia?"<ref>Tamsin Greig on BBC 6 Music's ''The [[Nemone]] show'', [[20 December]] [[2006]].</ref>

Separate from the series, a special sketch was made for [[Comic Relief]] and screened on [[11 March]] [[2005]]. Another was performed live at [[The Secret Policeman's Ball (2006)|The Secret Policeman's Ball]] on [[14 October]] [[2006]].

Episodes are currently being repeated on Sunday's on [[More4]] and can also be rented from [[4 on Demand]].

== Situation and plot ==
{{spoiler}}

[[Image:Green_Wing_Poster.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The main characters in ''Green Wing''. From left to right, Alan (Heap), Joanna (Haywood), Angela (Alexander), Caroline (Greig), Martin (Theobald), Guy (Mangan), Mac (Rhind-Tutt), Sue (Gomez) and Boyce (Chris).]]

[[Image:Green_Wing_-_Office_Girls.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The minor characters in ''Green Wing''. From left to right, Kim (Bretton), Rachel (Lyons), Harriet (Colman) and Karen (Raikes).]]

[[Caroline Todd|Dr. Caroline Todd]] ([[Tamsin Greig]]) is a surgical registrar, and the newest member of staff at the [[East Hampton Hospital Trust]], a seemingly normal [[National Health Service|NHS]] [[hospital]], but with staff ranging from the unusual to the completely bizarre. Caroline, a constantly embarrassed person, stumbles from one crisis to the next, mainly in the company of fellow doctors [[Guy Secretan]] ([[Stephen Mangan]]) and [[Mac (Green Wing)|Dr. "Mac" Macartney]] ([[Julian Rhind-Tutt]]).

Guy is a half-Swiss womanising [[anaesthetist]], who has slept with most of the women in the hospital. In life, the only things he likes as much as himself is probably [[Guyball]], a sport that he invented during his troubled years at public school. Mac is the effortlessly cool, charming surgeon, who is rather laid back, probably explaining why he has never been made a consultant. He was in a relationship with another doctor, Holly Hawkes, but after six years they broke up due to her having an abortion which he did not approve of. Guy and Mac have a long rivalry, and will often play odd games and make stupid bets in order to see who is best. During her time at the hospital, it becomes clear that Caroline may have feelings for them, but she is unsure as to who they are for.

Other people Caroline meets include [[Martin Dear]] ([[Karl Theobald]]), a well-meaning house officer who is constantly failing his exams, unloved by his mother and often faces bullying from Guy. Martin soon starts to form feelings for Caroline, and even starts to fall in love with her. Another member of staff is [[Angela Hunter]] ([[Sarah Alexander]]), a seemingly perfect and rather irritating senior registrar in paediatrics. Whilst Angela appears to mean well, Caroline cannot stand her, and despite her best efforts to avoid her, she ends up as Caroline's lodger.

Elsewhere in the hospital is [[Joanna Clore]] ([[Pippa Haywood]]), the 48-year-old head of [[human resources]] with an increasingly bitter attitude, especially with her younger members of staff. Amongst them include [[Harriet Schulenburg]] ([[Olivia Colman]]) an overworked mother of four trapped in an unhappy marriage, [[Kim Alabaster]] ([[Sally Bretton]]) who has a bad attitude to most of the people she comes into contact with, [[Naughty Rachel]] ([[Katie Lyons]]), who earned her nickname due to her perverted nature, and [[Karen Ball]] ([[Lucinda Raikes]]), the only member of staff who does any work, and suffers bullying from Kim and Rachel because of it. She is also a [[secret admirer]] of Martin.

Joanna's main form of excitement is usually in the form of [[Alan Statham]] ([[Mark Heap]]), a pompous, stuttering, kinky and extremely odd [[consultant]] [[radiologist]]. Alan and Joanna try their best to keep their relationship secret, despite the fact that everyone in the hospital knows about it. The one person most aware is [[Boyce (Green Wing)|Boyce]] ([[Oliver Chris]]), a junior house officer who spends most of his time trying to make Alan's life a living hell, rather than studying. Apart from Boyce, Alan is hated by most of the staff at the hospital, including Mac. Boyce spends most of his time with Martin and Kim.

In case anyone needs any extra help, Scottish staff liaison officer [[Sue White]] ([[Michelle Gomez]]) is hired to hear the staff's problems. However, Sue is probably the least suited person for her job. She is- perhaps surprisingly, considering how much competition she has- the most eccentric member of staff there, quite apart from being rude, cruel, foul-mouthed and, seemingly, a [[sociopath]]. Her office is a place where the impossible tends to happen, and anyone who enters it is normally treated with a mixture of verbal abuse and mental torture. The only person she treats with any affection is Mac, whom she loves to the point of madness, but Mac, like everyone else in the hospital, sees her as bordering on the edge of [[insanity]]. Anyone else who attempts to get involved with Mac is normally treated with hate by Sue.

== The making of ''Green Wing'' ==
=== The writers and crew ===

[[Image:East_Hampton_Logo_-_Green_Wing.jpg|thumb|right|225px|The [[East Hampton Hospital Trust]] logo.]]

''Green Wing'' was created and devised by [[Victoria Pile]], who is also the [[casting director]], one of the writers, the [[Television producer|producer]] (with [[Peter Fincham (producer)|Peter Fincham]] as [[executive producer]]). Pile is involved in the editing, filming and [[post-production]].

Pile also describes ''Green Wing'' as being a continuation of her previous show, ''[[Smack the Pony]]'', and as "a sketch-meets-comedy-drama-meets-soap".<ref> [http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greenwing/victoria.html ''Green Wing'' "microsite" interview with Victoria Pile, Page 1] Accessed [[7 January]] [[2007]].</ref> Most of the people involved in ''Green Wing'' have worked on ''Smack the Pony''.

The show has eight writers, who are Pile, [[Robert Harley (writer)|Robert Harley]], [[Gary Howe]], [[Stuart Kenworthy]], [[Oriane Messina]], [[Richard Preddy]], [[Fay Rusling]] and [[James Henry (writer)|James Henry]].

The show is directed by [[Tristram Shapeero]] and [[Dominic Brigstocke]]. Along with Pile, they contribute to the editing, which is used heavily in ''Green Wing''. Sketches are speeded-up or slowed-down to create comic effect, using body language to create humour. It is also used due to the amount of [[corpsing]] that occurs during the filming of the show. [[Tamsin Greig]] has been commented as someone who frequently corpses.<ref>[http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greenwing/tamsin2.html Channel 4 ''Green Wing'' microsite. Interview with Tamsin Greig, page 2.] Accessed [[7 January]] [[2007]].</ref>

The other notable member of the crew is [[Jonathan Whitehead]], who wrote the music for the show (under the name [[Trellis]]), which plays heavily in the show. His work won him an RTS Craft & Design Award (See [[Green Wing#Awards|Awards]]).

=== The writing and production ===

''Green Wing's'' title is said to have come from a small plastic green man with wings that was in [[executive producer]] [[Peter Fincham (producer)|Peter Fincham's]] top pocket, and fell on Pile's desk. Fincham claimed it was not his, so Pile kept it.<ref name="ser1commep1">''Green Wing'' Series 1 DVD, Audio  Commentary, Episode 1.</ref> This plastic man appears at the end of the credits on every show.

Originally, the show had a half-hour pilot made a year before transmission that was never aired. Scenes from the pilot can easily be spotted in the first episode, "Caroline's First Day," due to the characters' appearance, most notably Stephen Mangan's and Julian Rhind-Tutt's haircuts. The pilot allowed the writers to experiment, such as using different filming techniques.<ref name="ser1commep1"/> In the pilot, [[Doon Mackichan]] played [[Joanna Clore]] and was meant to play her in the original series, but left because she had a baby.<ref>[http://www.sitcom.co.uk/green_wing/news.shtml British Sitcom Guide - ''Green Wing'' News.] Accessed [[23 January]] [[2007]].</ref>

Although each script is fully written, the actors are allowed to improvise their own jokes, frequently adding to what has already been written. Normally [[workshop|workshops]] are used to allow actors to improvise their own material.<ref>''Green Wing'' Series 1 DVD, Behind The Scenes featurette.</ref> One example of improvised material was [[Stephen Mangan]] (Guy) who came up with the idea of Guy falling in love with Caroline. He said in an interview that, "‘Wouldn’t it be nice for him to actually fall in love with Caroline, rather than just be competing with Mac?’"<ref>{{cite news|first=Patricia|last=Nicol |title=Interview: He’s earned his wings|work=''Sunday Times'' |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/newspaper/0,,176-2257015,00.html  |date=9 July 2006|accessdate=2007-01-07}} Interview with Stephen Mangan</ref> Also, during series 2, [[Olivia Colman]], who played a pregnant Harriet, was also pregnant in real-life.<ref>''Green Wing'' Series 2 DVD, Audio  Commentary, Episode 4, Version 1.</ref>

Rusling, Howe, Messina and Harley all have had speaking parts in the show, most notably Harley playing Charles Robertson, the hospital's CEO. The show's crew often make appearances in the show as extras. Nearly everyone involved makes a small appearance. For example, Pile's former assistant Phil Secretan (whom Guy is named after) appears at the end of scene in the first episode.<ref name="ser1commep1"/> Henry appears in the background during Martin's exam in the episode, "Tests," for example.

Most of the filming was done at two hospitals, the [[Northwick Park Hospital]] in [[Middlesex]] and the [[North Hampshire Hospital]] in [[Basingstoke]]. This presented a problem because they had to work around the real-life hospital, with actual doctors, patients and emergency situations. In one scene in the final episode in series one, where Guy (Mangan) was hitting [[squash (sport)|squash balls]] behind him, and nearly hit a patient behind him.<ref name="ser1commep1"/> However, some scenes such as those in Sue and Alan's offices (Gomez and Heap respectively) were filmed in a studio.<ref>''Green Wing'' Series 1 DVD, Audio Commentary, Episode 2.</ref>

=== Unused storylines ===

Like many shows, ''Green Wing'' did have some other plotlines that were never used, or had some scenes that were cut from the show. Unused storylines included Alan (Heap) having an eighty-year-old wife and grandchildren as old as him, and Guy (Mangan) suffering from [[impotence]].<ref>''Green Wing'' Series 1 DVD, Audio Commentary, Episode 9.</ref>

Pile originally wanted the show to cover the entire hospital, not just doctors, but also porters, car park attendants and kitchen staff as well, however she eventually decided that they had enough material with the eight main doctors and human resources workers.<ref>[http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greenwing/victoria.html ''Green Wing'' "microsite" interview with Victoria Pile, Page 1.] Accessed [[7 January]] [[2007]].</ref>

There is also an [[Alternate ending|alternative ending]] to the special, which is included on the DVD, as well as deleted scenes from the episode. <ref>[http://www.sitcom.co.uk/green_wing/buy.shtml British Sitcom Guide - ''Green Wing'' Merchandise] Accessed [[7 January]] [[2007]].</ref> It is known that the actors wanted the alternative ending, but after some debate, it was not shown.<ref>[http://www.sitcom.co.uk/green_wing/news.shtml British Sitcom Guide - ''Green Wing'' News.] Accessed [[23 January]] [[2007]].</ref>

== Series Summaries ==
{{spoiler}}
=== Series 1 ===
{{main|Green Wing (series 1)}}

The first series introduced the main characters, as well as introducing Caroline to the world of East Hampton. During her time, she wonders as to whom she loves, Guy or Mac? Even then Martin seems to be attracted to her, and she has Angela as a lodger. Alan and Joanna are trying their best to hide their relationship from others, unsuccessfully, but soon Joanna falls for I.T. manager Lyndon Jones and Alan becomes jealous.

Sue also becomes jealous of Caroline as she starts to fall for Mac, and thus does her best to try and stop her, even to the point of murder. However, Caroline is having problems in the form of Mac's current girlfriend Emmy. Martin is having problems with his exams, as well as avoiding letting anyone know that Joanna is his mother. Boyce is busy mocking Alan and having a relationship with Kim. With Alan and Joanna's relationship falling apart, Alan becomes a Christian, but it is mainly due to the attractive chaplin.

Mac decides to move to Sheffield to get a better job, taking Emmy with him. Before he leaves, Mac bets with Guy that he cannot sleep with Joanna. Guy accepts the bet and takes her home. However, Martin has discovered some shocking news and tries his best to stop them having sex, but is somewhat distracted by Karen's affections. Caroline does her best to break up the relationship between Mac and Emmy, but it is Emmy who breaks up from Mac. Lyndon soon tells Joanna that he finds her distrubing, and Joanna then stops Alan's new-found Christian beliefs.

After Guy and Joanna make love, Martin arrives too late to tell them that Joanna is Guy's mother. She met Guy's father whilst she was an exchange student in Switzerland. Guy then stabs botox in Martin's legs as an act of revenge. Martin goes in the ambulance, and Caroline helps Joanna, but Guy punches Mac in a drunken rage and steals the ambulance. Mac tries to stop him and gets on the ambulance, but fails to stop him.

Guy drives the ambulance to Wales, with Mac and the paralysed Martin with him. Whilst Mac tries to phone the police, Guy drives into a field, and almost drives over a cliff. The first series ends Guy, Mac and Martin teetering over the edge.

=== Comic Relief sketch (2005) ===

Mac fends off Sue's advances by saying he will only allow her to touch his arse if she can raise £10,000 for Comic Relief. Sue then proceeds to try and ask Martin, Joanna, Guy and Alan for the money, which she eventually manages to raise, though Mac runs off before she can get hold of him.

=== Series 2 ===
{{main|Green Wing (series 2)}}
 
Eight weeks after the incident with the ambulance, Mac is in a coma and Guy has been suspended. Caroline is spending too much time with Mac, at least in Sue's opinion, and tries to stop her from seeing Mac. During his coma, Sue steals some of Mac's semen to make herself pregnant. Mac then comes out of his coma, but suffering from memory loss, meaning he cannot remember his new found love for Caroline. Angela soon leaves the hospital in order to take a career in television. With Angela gone, Guy becomes Caroline's new lodger.

Alan and Joanna are still having problems, though Martin and Karen seem to be getting along well. Martin then decides to leave Karen, and Joanna then tries to pull Lyndon again. However, Lyndon avoids this by saying he is dating Harriet. After a date, Harriet feels uncomfortable with the relationship and leaves him, but soon her husband Ian dumps her for having the affair.

Just when Caroline thinks she has managed to win Mac back, his former girlfriend Holly returns to the hospital, to replace Angela. Things become even worse when it is discovered that she never had the abortion that broke up Mac and Holly's relationship, and that Mac has a son. Caroline then distances herself from Mac, and Guy starts to fall in love with her. Caroline however seems to have feelings for Jake Leaf, a complementary therapist. Guy takes actions into his own hands and throws a Swiss Army Knife into Jake's head. Sue then discovers that Holly is lying, that Mac has no son and Holly leaves the hospital. Caroline dumps Jake and then tries to impress Mac again.

When Alan becomes unusually happy, after winning an internet caption competition, Joanna plans to make him upset again. Using her dwarf cousin, she plans to scare him. The plan backfires horribly when Alan is so scared, he beats Joanna's cousin to death with a stuffed heron. Alan and Joanna throw the body into the incinerator, but become paranoid that they will be discovered. Alan however learns from Boyce that they are treating the death as suicide, so Alan and Joanna go on the rampage, thinking themselves above the law.

After the death of a patient who offers them wise advice, Guy, Mac and Martin decide to propose to Caroline. She rejects Martin, considers an offer from Guy, and Mac appears to be unable to form one. Caroline then learns that Mac wants to meet her at the train station, but when she arrives, it is Guy who arrives. Mac is still at the hospital, where he learns that he is going to die. Caroline then accepts Guy's proposal of marriage.

Meanwhile in the HR department, Karen is sitting on top of a windowsill, due to her fear of [[The Clangers|clangers]]. Whilst sitting there, Rachel opens the window behind her, and causes Karen to fall out of the window. However, no-one seems to notice.

The police then arrive at the hospital. Alan and Joanna believe that they are going to arrest them, and with Boyce's help escape from the hospital. Alan and Joanna then escape in a camper van, with Alan becoming increasingly unstable. When it is discovered that Martin is riding in the back, Alan then drives into a field, and nearly drives the camper van over the same cliff that Martin was teetering over at the end of the first series.

=== The Secret Policeman's Ball sketch (2006) ===

A sketch was performed for [[Amnesty International|Amnesty International's]] [[The Secret Policeman's Ball (2006)|Secret Policeman's Ball]], with performances from Tamsin Greig, Stephen Mangan, Julian Rhind-Tutt and Michelle Gomez. Mangan and Rhind-Tutt appeared in two sketches.

When the announcer at the Ball asks if there is there a doctor in the house, Mac puts his hand up to Caroline's embarrassment. Things get more embarrassing when Guy also volunteers, and asks why Caroline is sitting next to Mac when she is Guy's fiancée. Things become even more bizarre when Sue appears in a tutu and a pair of very long arms, trying to protect Mac from [[stalking|stalkers]].

=== Special ===

{{main|Green Wing Special}}

The episode begins with the funeral of Angela, who departed the show during the second series, after being killed by a moose, according to Guy. Mac, after a months leave, discovers what has happened between Caroline and Guy, and although hurt, makes no attempt to interfere. Guy, upon learning of Mac's terminal illness, tells Caroline to marry Mac instead of him. Boyce pines at Alan's absence.

Meanwhile Alan and Joanna are still on the run, rescued by Martin who calls the AA. Whilst on their journey, they continue to accidently kill more people, including a shop assistant whom Alan "sat on to death". Boyce ends up missing Alan, after his replacement turns out to be even more horrible than Alan. Soon, they decide that, with no transport, money or employment, the only option is suicide. They are last seen, naked, walking hand-in-hand towards the sea.

Karen returns to work after her fall, but has changed drastically. She has become more confident, has developed better dress sense, but has lost her right hand and her nose whistles whenever she has an orgasm. With Joanna gone, the office girls start to run riot, forming their own tribe and becoming hostile to anyone who enters the department.

Mac and Caroline finally marry, despite Mac's terminal illness (the exact nature of the illness is never disclosed, although Mac does tell Guy that its name has an "a" and an "e" in it). Sue White gets over her obsession with Mac, and finds love with a new man, who reciprocates her feelings. The episode concludes with Caroline being carried into the air by a bunch of helium filled balloons at the wedding reception.

== Long-running jokes ==
''Green Wing'' has a lot of jokes that constantly run through the program and reappear, the most famous of these jokes is [[Guyball]], a sport invented by Guy when he was at public school, but with somewhat confusing rules. The basic object of the game is to throw a ball into a "Topmiler", which is a basket attached to a helmet.

''Green Wing'' also has a large amount of jokes about [[hair]]. Jokes are often made about Caroline's masculine hair, Alan's moustache, Sue's "Squirrel" and Mac's "Lion's mane".

Other recurring jokes include Boyce's practical jokes, the bizarre games played by the human resources staff, and the operation scenes with Caroline, Guy and Mac where they avoid doing the actual operation.

== Cultural references ==
{{main|Cultural references in Green Wing}}

''Green Wing'' has many references to famous [[song]]s, [[film]]s, [[television]] programs, and sometimes [[plays]]. There have been references to [[The Kinks]], ''[[Shrek]]'', ''[[The Italian Job]]'', ''[[The Flintstones]], ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' and ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]''.

== Comments and criticism ==

The show has somewhat of a mixed reaction. Many people like it for being original, funny, and breaking new ground. Several people have reviewed the show on the internet and on [[TV.com]] people have mostly given positive reviews.<ref>[http://www.tv.com/green-wing/show/29487/reviews.html?tag=tabs;reviews Green Wing Show and Episode Reviews] - TV.com, accessed [[7 January]] [[2007]].</ref>

Much of the media has praised ''Green Wing''. The Series 1 DVD has a list of quotations. The ''[[Evening Standard]]'' said that it was, "A comedy as physically adroit as it was verbally sharp," and ''[[The Guardian]]'' said that, "Channel 4’s hospital sitcom is the most innovative comedy since, well, ''[[The Office]]''."<ref> ''Green Wing - The Complete First Series DVD'' realised 4 April 2006.</ref> [[Matt Rudd]] of the ''Sunday Times'' wrote, whilst reviewing the Series 2 DVD that ''Green Wing'' was "…the best comedy series ever (yes, better than ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'' and, yawn, ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]''.)"<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/newspaper/0,,176-2376753,00.html ''Green Wing Series 2 DVD'' review in the ''Sunday Times'' by Matt Rudd, 1 October 2006.] Accessed [[7 January]] [[2007]].</ref>

The show provokes somewhat of a love/hate reaction. Although its fans tend to be very passionate, its detractors point to its seemingly random and meaningless comedy as being rubbish. Some complain that an hour-long show is too long. There was also criticism on the first episode of Series 2, which many people thought was not very good. The ''Sunday Times'' TV critic [[A. A. Gill]] was one who disapproved, writing, "Then the new one began with a dream sequence. Oh my God, I could hardly believe my eyes. Was I asleep? No, it really was a dream sequence. Now, every 11-year-old knows dream sequences are the lowest form of plotting solution, lower than unexplained superpowers such as the ability to stop time or become invisible; even lower than a magic get-better potion. Within two minutes, Green Wing had destroyed itself, lost its assured grip on the cliff of comedy and tumbled into the abyss of embarrassing overacting, formless gurning and pointless repetition."<ref>[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,14934-2109804,00.html "Doctor! It’s a sickly shade of green"] Criticism of ''Green Wing'' Series 2 by [[A. A. Gill]], writing for the ''Sunday Times'' 2 April 2006. Accessed [[7 January]] [[2007]].</ref>

Criticism of the shows use of [[lazzi]] methods between scenes was shown when it won the award for 'Worst Camerawork' at the 2006 Cookd and Bombd Comedy Tumbelweed awards, saying the "slow-slow-quick-quick-slow camera-work being one of a dozen different elements guaranteed to make me throw things at the telly."<ref>[http://chilled.cream.org/tumbleweed/ Cookd and Bombd Comedy Tumbleweed Awards 2006] Accessed [[9 January]] [[2007]].</ref> 

Some people believe that the lack of patients in ''Green Wing'' might be a satirical reference on the [[National Health Service]] today. An article in ''The Word'' magazine read, "Now Labour has stealthily encouraged privatisation in far more areas than Thatcher ever managed, the NHS has found itself populated by tired, cynical loons who will do everything they can to grab 40 winks or get their rocks off at work because they don't know anyone else and never see their houses. And in true New Labour New Medical Profession-style there's not a trace of medical jargon nor a doctor-patient relationship in sight. The hospital staff are all, without exception, idiots. They have social problems, hygiene issues, chequered histories and very loose morals. And they don't do any work." <ref>''The Word'', Issue 39, Published May 2006, "Nurse! The screens!" Page 133</ref>

One possible example of this is Caroline and Mac trying to put some students off working in medicine in, "Housewarming Party".

=== Books ===
The first series scripts were released as ''Green Wing: The Complete First Series Scripts'' in [[paperback]] on 22 October 2006 (ISBN 1-84576-421-8), by [[Titan Books]]. The book also contains bonus material made exclusively for the book and previously unseen photos.

According to the British Sitcom Website, the scripts for the second series are to be released in May 2007.<ref>[http://www.sitcom.co.uk/green_wing/buy.shtml British Sitcom Guide, Green Wing Merchandise] Accessed [[7 January]] [[2007]].</ref>

== Awards ==
''Green Wing'' won the first [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] Pioneer Audience Award in 2005. <ref>[http://www.bafta.org/site/webdav/site/myjahiasite/shared/import/TV_and_Craft_Winners_2000-2005.pdf BAFTA Winners & Nominations List 2000 - 2005] Accessed [[7 January]] [[2007]].</ref> This is the only BAFTA award that is voted on by the general public. It was also the first time the award was given out, making ''Green Wing'' the first show to win a BAFTA voted by the public.

Pippa Haywood won the 2005 [[Rose d'Or]] for "Best Female Comedy Performance". Tamsin Greig won a similar award at the [[Royal Television Society|RTS Awards]] in 2005 for "Best Comedy Performance". <ref>[http://www.rts.org.uk/awards.asp?sec_id=725&from=section RTS Winners and Nominations list 2005] Accessed [[7 January]] [[2007]].</ref>

Jonathan Whitehead won "Best Original Score" at the RTS Craft & Design Awards 2005.<ref>[http://www.rts.org.uk/Information_page_+_3_pic_det.asp?id=4390&sec_id=503 RTS Craft & Design Awards 2004/5] Accessed [[7 January]] [[2007]].</ref>

== A possible spin-off ==
The cast, crew and writers of ''Green Wing'' have shown no interest in creating a third series because of scheduling difficulties due to new projects being undertaken by the creators and talkbackTHAMES not having a big enough budget. However, creator [[Victoria Pile]] mentioned in an interview in the ''[[Radio Times]]'' she may do a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]], saying, "I'm hoping to do another Channel 4 comedy imminently, possibly starring some of the same cast. Hopefully, it will be some kind of spin-off from ''Green Wing''."<ref>[http://community.livejournal.com/___greenwing/692551.html ''Radio Times'' Christmas 2006 Edition] Article on [[livejournal]], 11 December 2006.

Since then, it has not only been accepted that Pile is creating a spin-off, but also that Channel 4 will probably accept it. However, details of it are not known. During the special appearance at the [[British Film Institute|BFI]], "When asked about a rumoured spinoff at the BFI event Victoria Pile seemed to glance in the direction of JRT, TG and SM before dodging the question."<ref>[http://www.sitcom.co.uk/green_wing/news.shtml British Sitcom Guide ''Green Wing'' News.] Accessed [[23 January]] [[2007]].</ref>

This is something of an unusual move as this show is marketed for the Americans first rather than the British.<ref>[http://www.sitcom.co.uk/news/news.php?story=000121 British Sitcom Guide - News - Green Wing writers create US pilot comedy] Accessed [[30 January]] [[2007]].</ref>
