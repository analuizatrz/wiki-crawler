==Plot==
{{spoiler}}
{{Cleanup|January 2007}}

The film is set in post-[[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]] northern [[Spain]], in 1944. A young, bookish girl, named Ofelia ([[Ivana Baquero]]), moves with her pregnant mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil) to a mill in the countryside so that her new stepfather Captain Vidal ([[Sergi López (actor)|Sergi López]]) can witness his child's birth.  Ofelia's real father was a tailor who had died in the war. Vidal and his small army have been sent to the remote area to rid it of a small [[Anarchism in Spain|anarchist]] [[militia]].

[[Image:Panslabyrinthofelia.JPG|thumb|155px|left|The faun gives Ofelia the book that explains her tasks]]
Ofelia, who often immerses herself in [[Mythology|ancient stories]] and [[fairy tales]], finds an immense and ancient [[labyrinth]] near her new home. There, she meets a [[faun]], Pan ([[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]]) who reveals that she is the long-lost Princess Moanna, daughter of the King of the [[Underworld]]. To regain entry, she must carry out three tasks to make sure her essence is still pure and she has not become mortal. The faun gives her a storybook, which will tell her the details of the tasks. Still cautious of the faun, Ofelia asks Mercedes if she knows anything about fauns. Mercedes replies: "My mother always told me never to trust a faun."
  
However, Ofelia decides to open the book and return to her place in the Underworld. Her first task is to retrieve a golden [[key]] from the belly of a giant [[toad]] that lives beneath a huge [[fig]] [[tree]] in the forest next to her house. Ofelia is able to get the key after tricking the toad into eating three magic [[stone]]s by mixing the stones with the giant bugs she finds under the tree; the stones cause the creature to vomit up the key and then expire.

Carmen, Ofelia's mother, is having even more trouble with her pregnancy. As Ofelia opens the book to view her second task, the pages turn red as if they are bleeding. Scared, she shuts the book and runs out of the bathroom only to see the front of her mother's dress covered in blood. They call the doctor and he sedates Carmen, ordering her to [[bedrest]] until the baby is born. Pan gives the worried Ofelia a [[mandrake]] root and instructs her to place it in a bowl of milk underneath her mother's bed. She is to feed it two drops of blood a day. Almost instantly, Carmen's fever and complications stop. Ofelia is very grateful to Pan.

Her next task is to unlock one of three boxes with the key, and retrieve whatever is inside. For this task she is is given a piece of magic [[chalk]], which she uses to draw a [[door]] that opens into an underground hall.  At the end of this hall, a huge feast is laid out in front of a slumbering creature known as the Pale Man (also played by Doug Jones). Prior to her departure, Pan warns Ofelia not to eat the slighest morsel from the feast because her life depends on it. After she retrieves a golden [[dagger]] from one of the cases, however, Ofelia is tempted by a plate of [[grape|grapes]] and decides to eat a few, despite her three [[fairy]] guides warning her against it. As soon as she takes a bite from a grape, the Pale Man awakens.  We learn from the pictures on the walls of the banquet hall that the Pale Man is a cannibal. He devours two of the fairies and then goes after Ofelia. Ofelia is able to escape by using her magic chalk to open a door back into her bedroom. 

Pan is disappointed in her because she disobeyed him and two of his fairy friends were killed as a result.  He tells her he does not believe in her anymore and that she is probably not the princess. He leaves Ofelia in an ever-worsening situation in which her mother is suffering terribly from her pregnancy, and her stepfather is more concerned with the health of his unborn child than that of Carmen. Trying to redeem herself, she checks on the mandrake root beneath her mother's bed and sees that it is no longer moving. Captain Vidal finds her and drags her out from underneath the bed. He looks underneath and finds the mandrake root. Angry at Ofelia, he squeezes the root until Carmen convinces him to stop. Carmen confronts Ofelia about her belief in a fantasy world, and to Ofelia's horror throws the mandrake root into the fire. The root writhes and cries like a baby. Almost immediately, Carmen goes into painful labor and dies in childbirth.

Pan tells Ofelia he will give her one more chance to prove that she is Princess Moanna. In her seemingly hopeless situation, Ofelia agrees to do anything that Pan asks of her. He tells her to bring her baby brother into the labyrinth. Since her stepfather does not leave eye shot of her brother, Ofelia puts a sedative in his drink. Even though the stepfather is heavily sedated, he is still able to follow Ofelia into the labyrinth.

In the labyrinth, Pan takes out the golden dagger and tells Ofelia in order to open the portal into the world of her birth, she must spill the blood of an innocent; that innocent being her brother.  Ofelia refuses, and Pan tells her that if she doesn't do as he says, she will remain mortal forever. Ofelia chooses to remain mortal, therefore saving her brother. Pan disappears and at the same time allows for Vidal to enter the center of the maze. Vidal finally stumbles onto Ofelia holding her brother, whereupon Vidal grabs his son and shoots Ofelia in the stomach. Vidal then stumbles slowly towards the entrance of the labyrinth holding his precious son in his arms where he is killed at the entrance by the militia.

As Ofelia is dying the viewer is transported to another world in which Ofelia, dressed as a princess is standing before her mother, the Queen, and her father, the King. The King explains to Ofelia that by sacrificing herself -- instead of her brother -- she has proven herself to be the true [[princess]].  However, as the movie ends, the viewer is left wondering whether Pan and the underworld kingdom is part of the reality of the film or an intense manifestation in the mind of a scared and isolated little girl.

==Cast==
*'''[[Ivana Baquero]]''' as '''Ofelia''': Del Toro says he was "scared shitless" in casting the right actress for the lead role, and that finding the 12-year old Spanish actress was purely accidental. "The character I wrote was initially younger, about 8 or 9 and Ivana came in and she was a little older than the character, with this curly hair which I never imagined the girl having. But I loved her first reading, my wife was crying and the camera woman was crying after her reading and I knew hands down Ivana was the best actress that had shown up, yet I knew that I needed to change the screenplay to accommodate her age."<ref name="DH">{{cite news |url=http://www.darkhorizons.com/news06/deltoro.php|title=

"Pan's Labyrinth" |accessdate=2007-01-28|date=[[2006-09-26]] |publisher=Dark Horizons |last=Fischer|first=Paul}}</ref> Baquero says that del Toro sent her lots of comics and fairytales to help her "get more into the atmosphere of Ofelia and more into what she felt." She says she thought the film was "marvellous", and that "At the same time it can bring you pain and sadness and scariness and happiness."<ref name="SF">{{cite news |url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/interviews/sfw14471.html|title=Guillermo del Toro and Ivana Baquero escape from a civil war into the fairytale land of ''Pan's Labyrinth''  |accessdate=2007-01-27|date=[[2006-12-25]] |publisher=[[Science Fiction Weekly]]|last=Spelling|first=Ian}}</ref>
*'''[[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]]''' as '''The Faun''' and '''The Pale Man''': Jones had worked with del Toro before on ''[[Mimic (film)|Mimic]]'' and ''[[Hellboy (film)|Hellboy]]'', and says the director sent him an email saying "You must be in this film. No one else can play this part but you". Jones read an English translation of the script and was enthusiastic but then found out the film was in Spanish, which he did not speak. Jones says he was "terrified" and del Toro suggested using a voice over actor to dub over him later, or learning Spanish phonetically, but Jones rejected both ideas preferring to learn it himself. He said "I really, really buckled down and committed myself to learning that word for word and I got the pronunciation semi right before I even went in", using the five hours a day he spent getting the costume and make-up to practice the words.<ref>{{cite news |url =http://www.canmag.com/news/4/3/6216|title=Doug Jones En Espanol |accessdate=2007-01-27 |date=[[2006-12-27]] |publisher=CanMag|last=Topel|first=Fred}}</ref> However, del Toro decided afterwards that he needed an authoritative theatre actor to articulate the character's lines, so dubbed over Jones.<ref>{{cite news |url =http://www.straight.com/node/63731 |title= Labyrinth’s faun unmasked |accessdate=2007-01-28 |date=[[2007-01-11]] |publisher=straight.com |last=Eisner|first=Ken}}</ref>
*'''[[Sergi López (actor)|Sergi López]]''' as '''Captain Vidal''': Del Toro met with López in [[Barcelona]], a year and a half before filming began, to ask him to play Vidal. López said of it, "For two hours and a half he explained to me all the movie, but with all the details, it was incredible, and when he finished I said, 'You have a script?' He said, 'No, nothing is written.'". López agreed to act in the movie and received the script one year later; he's said that "it was exactly the same, it was incredible. In his little head he had all the history with a lot of little detail, a lot of characters, like now when you look at the movie, it was exactly what he had in his head."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.canmag.com/nw/6255-sergi-lopez-pans-labyrinth-interview |title=Sergi Lopez on ''Pan's Labyrinth'' |accessdate=2007-01-27 |date=[[2007-01-02]]|publisher=CanMag| last=Topel |first=Fred}}</ref> In Spain, López was considered a melodramatic or comedic actor, and the producers told del Toro "You should be very careful because you don’t know about these things because you're Mexican, but this guy is not going to be able to deliver the performance"; del Toro replied "Well, it’s not that I don't know, it's that I don't care."<ref name="oscarwatch">{{cite news |url=http://www.oscarwatch.com/2007/01/pans_labyrinth_a_story_that.html |title=Pan's Labyrinth: A Story that Needed Guillermo Del Toro |accessdate=2007-01-27 |date=[[2007-01-11]]|publisher=oscarwatch.com| last=Stone|first=Sasha}}</ref>
*'''Ariadna Gil''' as '''Carmen'''
*'''[[Maribel Verdú]]''' as '''Mercedes''': Like López, Verdú was cast against type; usually playing a sex goddess, del Toro selected her to play the compassionate revolutionary because he "saw a sadness in her...he thought would be perfect for the part".<ref name="oscarwatch"/>
*'''Alex Angulo''' as '''Doctor Ferreiro'''
*'''Roger Casamajor''' as '''Pedro'''
*'''César Vea''' as '''Serrano'''

==Reception==

[[Mark Kermode]], in the [[The Observer]], labelled Pan's Labyrinth as the best film of 2006, describing it as "an epic, poetic vision in which the grim realities of war are matched and mirrored by a descent into an underworld populated by fearsomely beautiful monsters".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,1939681,00.html|title=Pain should not be sought - but it should never be avoided|accessdate=2007-01-25|date=[[2006-11-05]] |publisher=[[The Observer]]|last=Kermode|first=Mark|authorlink=Mark Kermode}}</ref> Stephanie Zacharek wrote that the film "works on so many levels that it seems to change shape even as you watch it",<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.salon.com/ent/movies/review/2006/10/13/pans_labyrinth/|title=Pan's Labyrinth|accessdate=2007-01-25|date=[[2006-10-13]] |publisher=[[Salon.com]]|last=Zacharek|first=Stephanie}}</ref> and Jim Emerson found the film "as gruesome and brutal as it is enchanting and spellbinding".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061228/REVIEWS/61228001/1023|title=Pan's Labyrinth |accessdate=2007-01-25|date=[[2006-12-29]] |publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |last=Emerson|first=Jim}}</ref> For [[The San Diego Union-Tribune]], David Elliott says "the excitement is tangible", but adds that "what it lacks is successful unity...Del Toro has the art of many parts, but only makes them cohere as a sort of fevered extravaganza."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20070111/news_lz1c11pan.html|title=Artist in charge |accessdate=2007-01-25|date=[[2007-01-11]] |publisher=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]] |last=Elliott|first=David}}</ref>

During its limited first three weeks at the [[United States]] [[box office]], the film made [[US$]]5,430,300. As of [[January 28]], [[2007]], it has grossed around $42 million worldwide.<ref name="bom" />

==Influences==
Del Toro has said the film has strong connections in theme to ''[[The Devil's Backbone]]'' and should be seen as an informal sequel dealing with some of the issues raised there.<ref>[http://www.festival-cannes.fr/films/fiche_film.php?langue=6002&id_film=4359827#news ''Pan's Labyrinth'' in the 2006 Cannes Film Festival]</ref> In 2004, del Toro said: "Pan is an original story. Some of my favorite writers (Borges, Blackwood, Machen, Dunsany) have explored the figure of the god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] and the symbol of the labyrinth. These are things that I find very compelling (remember the labyrinth image on [[Hellboy (film)|Hellboy]]?) and I am trying to mix them and play with them." However, in 2007, del Toro admitted to the striking similarities between his film and [[C.S. Lewis]]'s ''[[Chronicles of Narnia]]'', which both have similar child-age principal characters, mythic creatures (particularly the fauns), and themes of "disobedience and choice."  Says del Toro: "This is my version of that universe, not only 'Narnia,' but that universe of children's literature."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/Movies/01/03/film.guillermo.deltoro.ap/index.html|title=Director creates a scary fairy tale |accessdate=2007-01-28|date=[[2007-01-03]] |publisher=[[CNN]]}}</ref>  Some of the works he drew on for inspiration include [[Jorge Luis Borges]]' ''Labyrinths'', [[Arthur Machen|Arthur Machen's]] ''[[The Great God Pan]]'' and ''[[The White People]]'', [[Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron Dunsany|Lord Dunsany's]] ''The Blessing of Pan'', [[Algernon Blackwood|Algernon Blackwood's]] ''Pan's Garden'' and [[Francisco Goya|Francisco Goya's]] .<ref>[http://www.deltorofilms.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5&start=0&postdays=0&postorder=asc&highlight=&sid=2e4cd823ac827248f20a4820065589d2 Del Toro message board]</ref>
