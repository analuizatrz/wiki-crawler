'''Matthew Abram Groening''' (born [[February 15]], [[1954]] in [[Portland, Oregon]]; his [[family name]] is pronounced {{IPA|/'greɪnɪŋ/}}, rhymes with ''raining'') is an [[Emmy]]-winning [[United States|American]] [[cartoonist]] and the creator of the American [[animated television series]] ''[[The Simpsons]]''<ref name="theage">{{cite web | title=Matt Groening's family values | work=[[The Age]] | url=http://www.snpp.com/other/interviews/groening00a.html | last=Idato | first=Michael | date=2000-07-18 | accessdate=January 14 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> and ''[[Futurama]]'', as well as the weekly comic strip ''[[Life in Hell]]''. He currently serves as a creative consultant for ''The Simpsons'', a position he has held for nearly eighteen years since the show's inception in [[1989 in television|1989]].

==Early life==
The middle child of five children, Groening grew up in [[Portland, Oregon]]. His mother, Margaret, was once a teacher. His father, Homer, was a filmmaker, advertising man, writer and cartoonist - “the kinds of cartoons that had guys standing in bars making disparaging comments,” according to Groening in a 1993 online Q&A.<ref name="prodigy">{{cite web | title=Matt Groening Q&A (1993) | work=[[The Simpsons Archive]] | url=http://www.snpp.com/other/interviews/groening00a.html | date=June 1993 | accessdate=January 14 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

He attended [[The Evergreen State College]] in [[Olympia, Washington]], a progressive school which he called "a hippie college, with no grades or required classes, that drew every creative weirdo in the Northwest."<ref name="laweekly">{{cite web | title=Life in the 31st Century | date=1999-03-24 | last=Lloyd | first=Robert | work=LA Weekly | url=http://www.laweekly.com/ink/99/18/tv-lloyd.php | accessdate=December 30 | accessyear=2005}}</ref> There he was the Editor-in-Chief of the campus newspaper, ''The Cooper Point Journal''.  In the weekly publication he regularly applied his writing skills, and started applying his drawing skills in occasional comic strips.  He became friends with [[Lynda Barry]] after discovering she had written a fan letter to [[Joseph Heller]], one of Groening’s favorite authors, and had gotten a reply back.<ref name="cartoon">{{Comic strip reference

==Career==
In 1977, at the age of 23, Groening moved to [[Los Angeles]] to become a [[writer]]. On the way there, his car broke down in the fast lane of the [[Hollywood Freeway]]. He found [[work]] for a time as a [[chauffeur]] and "biographer" for an unsuccessful 88-year-old B-[[Western (genre)|Western]] movie [[Film director|director]]. He described life in [[Los Angeles]] to his [[friends]] in the form of a [[comic book]], and called it ''[[Life in Hell]]'' which was loosely inspired by a chapter entitled “How to Go to Hell” in [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann's]] book ''Critique of Religion and Philosophy''.<ref name="mygeneration">{{cite web | title=Matt Groening | date=May-June 2001 | last=McKenna | first=Kristine | work=My Generation | url=http://www.snpp.com/other/interviews/groening01a.html | accessdate=February 3 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

Groening started the comic in 1977 by photocopying and distributing it in the book corner of Licorice Pizza, the record store he was working in. He made his first professional cartoon sale to the avant-garde [[wet (magazine)|Wet magazine]] in 1978 (the strip, entitled “Forbidden Words”, appeared in the September/October issue), and by 1980 the strip had become so popular in the [[Underground culture|underground]] that it was picked up by the ''[[Los Angeles Reader]]'', where he also delivered papers as well as some editing and paste-up.

In 1982, the editor of the ''Reader'' gave Groening his own weekly [[Rock and roll|rock ‘n’ roll column]], "Sound Mix". However, the column would rarely be about rock ‘n’ roll, as he would instead write more about his life and childhood, his [[pet peeves]], and even things he found in the street. “I think the people who ran the ''Reader'' felt so guilty about how little they were paying people that they let them write about whatever they wanted”, Groening later reflected.<ref name="laweekly"/> In an effort to add more rock to the column, he would often simply make up stuff, writing reviews of fictional bands and non-existent records. The following week, he would confess to fabricating everything in the previous column, then swear that everything in the new column was true. Finally, he was asked to give up the "music" column and perhaps write a humor column under a different title.<ref name="royale">{{cite book |last=Groening |first=Matt |title=Simpsons Comics Royale |chapter=My Rock 'n' Roll Life, Part One: So You Want To Snort Derisively |pages=92-93 |year=2001 |publisher=Perennial |location=New York |isbn=0-060-93378-X}}</ref>

Groening met his wife, [[Deborah Caplan]], in 1980 at the ''Los Angeles Reader'' (they divorced in 1999). In late 1984, she published Groening’s first cartoon book, ''Love is Hell'', which was a big underground success. Soon afterward, they left the ''Reader'' and put together the Life in Hell Co., which handled [[Print syndication|syndication]] and [[merchandise]] for Groening’s projects.

In the late 1980s, Groening drew several print [[advertisements]] for [[Apple Computer]] in the form of ''Life in Hell'' comic strips.<ref>[http://homepage.mac.com/mbishop/PhotoAlbum30.html Matt Groening Apple Ad from 1989]</ref>

The strip is still carried in many weekly newspapers and has been [[anthology|anthologized]] in a series of books, including ''School is Hell'', ''Childhood is Hell'', ''Work is Hell'', ''The Big Book of Hell'' and ''The Huge Book of Hell''.

===''The Simpsons''===
{{Main|The Simpsons}}
[[Image:Simpsons on Tracey Ullman.png|thumb|250px|left|Groening's first drawing of the Simpsons, circa [[1986]].]]
''[[Life in Hell]]'' caught the attention of [[Hollywood]] [[writer]]-[[Film producer|producer]] and [[Gracie Films]] founder [[James L. Brooks]], who had been shown the strip by fellow producer Polly Platt.<ref name="americasfirstfamily">{{cite video|people=BBC|year=2000|title=The Simpsons: America's First Family (6 minute edit for the season 1 DVD)|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0250735/|format=DVD|location=UK|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref><ref name="kim">{{cite web | title=Keep 'em Laughing | date=October 1999 | last=Kim | first=John W. | work=Scr(i)pt | url=http://www.snpp.com/other/interviews/groening99d.html | accessdate=January 14 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> In 1985, Brooks contacted Groening with the proposition of working in [[animation]] on an undefined future project. That project would turn out to be developing a series of short animation [[skit]]s, called “bumpers”, to be featured on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] variety show [[The Tracey Ullman Show]]. Originally, Brooks wanted Groening to adapt his ''Life in Hell'' characters for the show. Fearing the loss of ownership rights, Groening decided to create something new. Reportedly, he designed the look of the [[Simpson family]] in only fifteen minutes.

Groening [[storyboard|storyboarded]] and scripted every short, which were then animated by a team including [[David Silverman]] and [[Wes Archer]], both of whom would later become [[Film director|directors]] on the series.<ref name="silverman">{{cite web | title=The David Silverman Interview | last=Heintjes | first=Tom | work=Hogan's Alley | url=http://cagle.msnbc.com/hogan/interviews/silverman.asp | accessdate=January 13 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> 

Premiering on the Tracey Ullman Show on [[April 19]], [[1987]], the shorts became very popular, which led to a half-hour [[spin-off]] in 1989. The [[The Simpsons|series]] quickly became a worldwide phenomenon, to the surprise of many. Groening said: “Nobody thought The Simpsons was going to be a big hit. It snuck up on everybody."<ref name="laweekly"/>  

Sometime in the 1990s, he tried to pitch a [[live-action]] [[spin-off]] about [[Krusty the Clown]], but was unsuccessful. He has also pitched “Young [[Homer Simpson|Homer]]” and a spin-off about the non-Simpsons citizens of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]. Supposedly, there were also plans for a [[live-action]] [[movie]] based on the character [[Troy McClure]], to be played by [[Phil Hartman]], but this was canceled due to Hartman's death.

In 1995, Groening got in a major disagreement with [[James L. Brooks|Brooks]] and other Simpsons producers over “[[A Star is Burns]]”, a [[fictional crossover|crossover]] episode with ''[[The Critic]]'', an animated show also produced by Brooks and staffed with many former Simpsons crew members. Groening feared that viewers would “see it as nothing but a pathetic attempt to advertise ''The Critic'' at the expense of The Simpsons”,<ref name="flux">{{cite web | title=Life in Hell | work=Flux Magazine | url=http://www.snpp.com/other/interviews/groening95.html | last=Paul | first=Alan | date=1995-09-30 | accessdate= [[December 26]] | accessyear=2005}}</ref> and was concerned about the implication that he had created or produced ''The Critic''. He requested his name be taken off the episode. 

He has had several [[cameo appearance]]s in the show (an incomplete list can be found [http://snpp.com/guides/meta.html#groening here]), with a speaking role in the episode ''[[My Big Fat Geek Wedding]]''.

He currently serves at ''The Simpsons'' as a [[Creative Consultant|creative consultant]], as well as a writer and producer on the upcoming [[The Simpsons Movie|movie]].

====''Simpsons'' character names====
Groening named the main Simpson characters after members of his own family: his parents, Homer and Margaret (Marge or Marjorie in full), and his younger sisters, Lisa and Margaret (Maggie). As for himself, he decided it was a bit too obvious to name a character after himself and chose the name "Bart" (an [[anagram]] of brat). The last name of the family, according to [[Audio commentary|commentary]] on the Season 2 [[DVD]], came from the fact that "Simpson" means "son of a simpleton" (though it really means "son of Simon").  However, he stresses that aside from some of the sibling rivalry, his family is nothing like the Simpsons. In the [[Nathanael West]] novel and subsequent movie, [[The Day of the Locust]], the main character shares the name of [[Homer Simpson]], but Groening also admits in the commentary that it is a coincidence.

Groening also has an older brother and sister, Mark and Patty, but these siblings were left out of the main Simpson family. It is questionable whether Marge’s sister [[Patty Bouvier|Patty’s]] name comes from Groening’s sister or if it is a coincidence. In a 1995 interview, he divulged that Mark “is the actual inspiration for Bart.”<ref name="flux"/>

Groening says he refused to name [[Abraham Simpson|Homer's dad]] after his own father's  dad, leaving it to other writers to choose a name. He says that the writers named the character Abraham, which by coincidence turned out to be the name of Groening's grandfather. Homer and Abraham are also the names of Groening's two sons.

The name “Wiggum” for police chief [[Clancy Wiggum]] was Groening's mother's maiden name. The names of [[List of characters from The Simpsons|a few other characters]] were taken from major street names in Groening's hometown of [[Portland, Oregon]], including [[Flanders family|Flanders]], [[List of characters from The Simpsons#The Lovejoy family|Lovejoy]], [[Herb Powell|Powell]], [[Joe Quimby|Quimby]], [[List of characters from The Simpsons#Kearney|Kearney]], and [[Sideshow Bob|Terwilliger]].<ref name="portland">{{cite web | title=Painting the town in Portland | date=2007-01-06 | last=Blake | first=Joseph | work=The Vancouver Sun | url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/travel/story.html?id=f90268d8-6a5b-438d-9509-f03ecff27cc1 | accessdate=January 13 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

===''Futurama''===
{{Main|Futurama}}
After spending a few years researching [[science fiction]], Groening got together with ''Simpsons'' staff writer [[David X. Cohen]] (who was still known as David S. Cohen at the time) and developed ''[[Futurama]]'', an animated series about life in the year 3000. He described trying to get the show on the air as "by far the worst experience of my grown-up life."<ref name="motherjones">{{cite web | title=Matt Groening | work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] | url=http://www.motherjones.com/arts/qa/1999/03/groening.html | last=Doherty | first=Brian | date=March/April 1999 | accessdate=January 14 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>
 
The [[Emmy]]-winning show was a moderate success but languished in the ratings. After five years on the air, the show was cancelled by [[20th Century Fox]]. However, in a similar situation to ''[[Family Guy]]'', strong DVD sales and very stable ratings on [[Cartoon Network]] and [[Teletoon]] have brought Futurama back to life, which is slated for four direct-to-DVD movies, as confirmed by Groening in an [[April 2006]] interview.<ref name="avclub">{{cite web | title=Matt Groening | date=2006-04-26 | last=Rabin | first=Nathan | work=[[The Onion AV Club]] | url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/47771 | accessdate=January 14 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> [[Comedy Central]] commissioned 13 new episodes to be aired in 2008.

===Other===
In 1994, Groening formed [[Bongo Comics|Bongo Comics Group]] (named after the character Bongo from [[Life in Hell]]) with [[Steve Vance]], [[Cindy Vance]] and [[Bill Morrison (comics)|Bill Morrison]], which publishes [[The Simpsons|Simpsons]] and [[Futurama]] comics (including a two-part comic special entitled  ''Futurama Simpsons Infinitely Secret Crossover Crisis'', a [[fictional crossover]] between the two), as well as a few original titles. The goal with Bongo is to "[try] to bring humor into the fairly grim comic book market".<ref name="flux" /> He also formed [[Zongo Comics]] in 1995, an imprint of Bongo that published comics for more mature readers, which included three issues of [[Mary Fleener|Mary Fleener's]] ''Fleener'' and seven issues of Groening's close friend [[Gary Panter|Gary Panter's]] "Jimbo" comics. 

Groening has released a large number of books with ''[[HarperCollins]]'' publishers.

He is a member of the all-author [[rock and roll]] band [[Rock Bottom Remainders|The Rock Bottom Remainders]], whose members include [[Dave Barry]], [[Ridley Pearson]], [[Scott Turow]], [[Amy Tan]], [[James McBride (musician)|James McBride]], [[Mitch Albom]], [[Roy Blount Jr.]], [[Stephen King]], [[Kathi Goldmark]], and [[Greg Iles]].

In 2003, he curated the U.S. [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] music festival in [[Los Angeles]].

Groening has also provided voicework for several films, including ''Tales of the Rat Fink'', a [[2006]] [[Documentary film|documentary]] about [[Ed Roth|Ed "Big Daddy" Roth]], and ''Hair High'', a [[2004]] [[Bill Plympton]] film.

==Awards==
Groening received the [[National Cartoonist Society]] [[Reuben Award]] for 2002, and had been nominated for the same [[award]] in 2000.<ref>[http://www.reuben.org/ncs/awards2.asp THE OUTSTANDING CARTOONIST OF THE YEAR] ''reuben.org''.

==Personal life==
Groening and Caplan married in 1986 and had two sons together, Homer (who goes by “Will”) and Abe, both of whom Groening occasionally portrays as rabbits in ''Life in Hell''. The couple divorced in 1999 after thirteen years of marriage. Following this, he was in a six-year commitment with dating expert [[Lauren Frances]].<ref>[http://www.nndb.com/people/361/000025286/ Matt Groening] ''nndb.com''.

==Television writing credits==
Matt Groening  is credited with writing or co-writing the following episodes:
*'''''The Simpsons'':''' "[[Some Enchanted Evening (The Simpsons episode)|Some Enchanted Evening]]", "[[The Telltale Head]]", "[[Colonel Homer]]" and "[[22 Short Films About Springfield]]". 
*'''''Futurama'':''' "[[Space Pilot 3000]]".

==Trivia==
*In one of his music [[reviews]] for the ''Los Angeles Reader'', Groening panned musician [[Danny Elfman]] badly enough that Elfman responded with an irate letter to the editor.<ref name="prodigy"/> Elfman would later go on to do the theme for ''The Simpsons''.
*Both Groening and his character [[Bart Simpson]] are [[left-handed]]. Other left-handed characters on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' include [[Ned Flanders]], [[Montgomery Burns|Mr. Burns]], [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon|Apu]], and [[Moe Szyslak]]; however, several episodes have "continuity errors" in which they appear to be right handed.
*Several of his characters have the middle initial 'J', including [[Bartholomew J. Simpson]], [[Homer J. Simpson]], [[Phillip J. Fry]], and [[Hubert J. Farnsworth]]. Groening has said that this is an homage to [[Bullwinkle J. Moose]] and [[Rocket J. Squirrel]], whose middle initials were in reference to [[Rocky & Bullwinkle]] creator [[Jay Ward]].
*In some of Groening's original drawings of [[Homer Simpson]], Homer's ear was shaped like a "G", and the hair above in the shape of an "M", spelling Groening's initials. However, he did not include this in later drawings as he decided it would be too distracting for those who were aware of it. Groening includes the initials when drawing autographed pictures of Homer for fans. On the Season 7 DVD animatic for "[[The Day the Violence Died]]", Groening revealed he often misspells his autograph with "Greoning" for "annoying" fans.
*His sister, Lisa (who is now a high school teacher), is married to [[Craig Bartlett]], creator of ''[[Hey Arnold!]]''. Before ''[[Hey Arnold!]]'' became a show, Arnold comic strips drawn by Bartlett appeared in the [[magazine]] ''[[Simpsons Illustrated]]'' in the early 1990s.
