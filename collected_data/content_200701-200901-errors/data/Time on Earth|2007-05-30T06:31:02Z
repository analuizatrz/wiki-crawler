'''''Time on Earth''''' is the fifth studio album by the pop-rock band [[Crowded House]]. Tracks have been produced by both [[Ethan Johns]] and [[Steve Lillywhite]] and the album is due to be released June 30, 2007 in Australia,  July 2, 2007 in the UK and July 10, 2007 in North America.<ref name="pf">[http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/42575-johnny-marr-on-crowded-house-reunion-album Pitchfork Media], 04-25-07</ref> ''Time on Earth'' marks the reunion of the band eleven years after they disbanded and features new drummer [[Matt Sherrod]] in place of the original drummer, the late [[Paul Hester]], who took his own life in 2005.

==Album history==
The album was originally intended to be frontman [[Neil Finn]]'s third solo release.  In the wake of Paul Hester's death, as well as preparations for the release of the live album ''[[Farewell To The World]]'', the band members were drawn together and their friendship was reinvigorated.  Neil Finn invited bassist [[Nick Seymour]] to participate in the recording of his new album and subsequent tour.  After recording a complete album with Ethan Johns in the producer's seat, studio musician [[Joey Waronker]] drumming and Seymour contributing substantially throughout the process, Finn decided Crowded House would reform and that ''Time on Earth'' would be the band's fifth studio album.

With new drummer Matt Sherrod and multi-instrumentalist [[Mark Hart]] now involved as members of the official lineup, the band returned to the studio to record four additional tracks with producer Steve Lillywhite.  Guitarist [[Johnny Marr]] was involved in the recording of "Even A Child" and "Don't Stop Now"<ref>[http://www.nme.com/news/crowded-house/27923 nme.com] - nme.com news article</ref>, and British soul singer [[Beth Rowley]] provided backup vocals for the song "Transit Lounge."  Hart and Sherrod also contributed retroactively to some of the Ethan Johns-produced material.  In its final form, the album will feature tracks mixed by Johns, Lillywhite and [[Tchad Blake]].  

{{Quote box|width=350|align=right|quote=It doesn't sound like any one particular Crowded House album, but it has elements of Crowded House... in as much as Nick and I make a sound together when we play and always did. I think there's a lot of heart and spirit in the album which is connected with the loss of our dear friend Paul but also an attempt to try and make sense of it and move forward. And as such, it seemed the most obvious and best way to do that was to be playing music again with each other, Nick and I. I want to be in a band and what other band could it be.|source=Neil Finn<ref>[http://www.farewelltotheworld.com EMI site] - video interview Feb. 2007</ref>}}

On March 17, 2007 the band played a 2 1/2 hour set streamed live to the internet from [[Peter Gabriel]]'s studio in England. The following new songs from the album were played:

* "[[Silent House]]"

* "She Called Up"
* "Heaven That I'm Making"
* "Nobody Wants To"
* "[[Don't Stop Now]]"{{col-end}}

==Cover art==
As he did for the first four Crowded House albums, Nick Seymour, also an artist, created the [[cover art]] for ''Time on Earth''. The group's name "Crowded House" appears with jumbled case, some lower and some upper case, appearing as "cRoWdED HOusE" and the album title also in a part jumble with all but the last two letters in upper case, appearing as "TIME ON EARth." The cover also features a blue dragon eating a human. This is to symbolise former member Hester being consumed by depression (symbolised by the dragon being blue) and this brought his time on earth to an early end. The cover art is almost completely composed of newspaper cuttings collaged together--even the image of the man and the dragon are newspaper cuttings which Seymour painted onto. Only the tree on the right, and the title text are not composed of newspaper cuttings. The human figure appears to be grasping at this newspaper-free title text; this may symbolize the figure's desire for freedom from all that a newspaper may represent (politics, consumerism, media manipulation, war: the horrors of modern life).  This also implies that a person's "time on earth" should not, ideally, be tainted by such things.  This same significance may be applied to the painted, newspaper-free tree, as it was under a tree in a Melbourne park where Paul Hester took his own life.

==Track listing==
In April 2007, the band's website went live and included a confirmation of the track listing of ''Time on Earth''<ref name="pf">[http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/42575-johnny-marr-on-crowded-house-reunion-album Pitchfork Media], 04-25-07</ref>. Notably, the album has 14 tracks, only the second studio album by Crowded House to have as many, the previous being ''[[Woodface]]''. The album features the guitar work of [[Johnny Marr]], guitarist and songwriter of [[The Smiths]], on "Even a Child" and lead single "[[Don't Stop Now]];" Marr co-wrote the former song with Finn. The album also includes the song "Silent House," which Finn co-wrote with the [[Dixie Chicks]] (which also appeared on their 2006 [[Grammy]]-winning album ''[[Taking the Long Way]]'').
