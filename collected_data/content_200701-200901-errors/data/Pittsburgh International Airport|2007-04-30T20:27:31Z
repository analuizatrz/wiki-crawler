'''Pittsburgh International Airport''' {{Airport codes|PIT|KPIT|PIT}}, commonly shortened to PIT,  is an international [[airport]] located in the [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] suburb of [[Findlay Township, Pennsylvania|Findlay Township]], approximately 20 miles west of downtown Pittsburgh. It is owned and operated by the [[Allegheny County Airport Authority]] which also operates the [[Allegheny County Airport]] near West Mifflin, Pennsylvania. PIT is primarily a passenger airport, providing 290 non-stop flights per day to 80 destinations via 19 airlines. In 2006, traffic was just shy of the 10 million mark at 9,987,310 with 235,264 aircraft operations.<ref>[http://www.flypittsburgh.com/stats/DECEMBER_2006_SHORT_E-MAIL_REPORT.pdf Pittsburgh International Airport Summary of Traffic]</ref>

Pittsburgh International is the second largest passenger airport in Pennsylvania behind [[Philadelphia International Airport]] and is the 40th busiest airport in the country.<ref>[http://www.aci-na.org/asp/traffic.asp?art=215 2005 North America Final Traffic Report : Total Passengers]</ref> US Airways operated their largest hub at PIT until 2004. They are still the primary airline to serve PIT but they now consider it to be their largest secondary hub. Southwest Airlines started service in May of 2005 and are now the second largest airline in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh is also a hub for [[Air Midwest]], [[Colgan Air]] and [[Republic Airlines]].

Pittsburgh International Airport occupies more than 12,900 acres (45 km²), making it the fourth largest airport in the nation<ref>[http://pittsburgh.about.com/library/weekly/aa122100a.htm About.com: Pittsburgh International Airport]</ref>.  It is so large that both Chicago's [[O'Hare International Airport|O'Hare]] and Atlanta's [[Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Hartsfield-Jackson]] could comfortably fit within the airport's land area.

Accessing Pittsburgh International is fairly easy by car. The airport sits conveniently at the intersection of [[PA Route 60]] (future [[I-376]]) and [[PA Route 576]] (future [[I-576]]). Bus service is also available from downtown Pittsburgh. The Port Authority operates the 28X bus from Downtown/ Oakland directly to the airport.

PIT has been frequently recognized for its quality in meeting travelers' needs. The OAG Worldwide listed the facility to its short list of the world's best airports for four consecutive years. The market research leader, JD Power and Associates named PIT among the top five airports in its two most recent customer satisfaction surveys. Conde Nast Traveler's Magazine named PIT among the best in the United States and in the world in its People's Choice Award.

==History==
[[Image:yaotdisplay.jpg|left|135px|thumb|Yesterday's Airport of Tomorrow Display]]
Until the beginning of [[World War II]], [[Moon Township, Pennsylvania|Moon Township]], PA was mostly a rural agricultural area. It was too far from Pittsburgh to be considered a "suburb" that it is today. In the early 1920s, John A. Bell of [[Carnegie, Pennsylvania|Carnegie]] purchased a number of small farms in Moon and established a major commercial dairy farm on his 1, 900 acres of land. He was bought out by Mr. and Mrs. E.E. Reick and C.F. Nettrour, owners of the established "Reick's" Dairy, and doubled the amount of cattle at the farm.

By 1940, the United States was becoming involved in WWII. The [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) identified that the Pittsburgh area needed a military airport to defend the industrial wealth of the area. It would also provide a training base and stop- over facility. The agricultural expanses of Moon Township was attractive to the early airport planners in the city. The WPA bought the Bell Farm and began construction of the runways.

In 1944, Allegheny County officials proposed to expand the military airport with a commercial passenger terminal. The new terminal would replace the Allegheny County Airport which opened in 1926 in West Mifflin. Ground was broken on the new airport on July 18, 1946. The new terminal building would eventually cost $33 million to build and was built by all Pittsburgh companies. The Greater Pittsburgh Airport opened on May 31, 1952. The first flight occurred on June 3, 1952. In its full year of operation in 1953, over 1.4 million total passengers used the terminal. At that time, it was considered "modern" and spacious. In fact, the airport was one of the largest in the United States, second only to Idlewild Airport (now [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|JFK Airport]]) in New York.

[[Image:clockfloor.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Clock floor re-creation]]

The airport was designed by a local architect named Josep W. Hoover. One of the primary features of his style is the use of simple, exposed concrete, steel, and glass materials. The terminal building was constructed in "stepped" levels: the first floor extended farther than the second, the second floor extended farther then the third, etc. The uncovered roof of the lower level could then be used as an observation deck. In addition to the observation desks, the rounded "Horizon Room" was designed on the fourth floor with a commanding view of the airport runways. The interior of the terminal building was designed in the International Style like the exterior. One of the most memorable features of the lobby was the large compass laid in the floor with the green and yellow- orange terrazzo. The lobby also included shops and services for travelers. A mobile by Alexander Calder was another decorative feature of the lobby. The mobile currently hangs in the center core of the new airside terminal. 

The first five airlines of the Greater Pittsburgh Airport were [[Trans World Airlines|TWA]], [[Capital Airlines]] (later part of United), Northwest, All American (later it become Allegheny Airlines, USAir, and finally US Airways), and [[Eastern Airlines]].

In 1959, the east dock was added to the terminal as air travel became more popular. On July 25, 1959, TWA introduced the first scheduled commercial jet service (Douglas DC- 8) to Pittsburgh. With the longer range of jet engines, international air travel was more practical. By 1969, the airport sought to become an "international" airport. Ground was broken for the new International Wing, west of the original terminal building, on July 8, 1970. The International Wing opened in 1972 to accommodate federal inspection services and other requirements for international travel. In that year, local newspapers advertised airline tickets to numerous places in Europe, the Caribbean, Japan, and Canada.

In 1972, rotundas were added to the end of each dock to further expand the number of gates at the terminal. In the later 1970's, significant growth in regional air travel created a need for additional gates at the terminal. In 1980, the South East Dock was opened. Even with all the expansions, the terminal could not meet the needs of modern air travel. Operations moved into the new Midfield Terminal in 1992.

On October 1, 1992, the new Midfield Terminal opened and all operations transferred over from the old terminal. Pittsburgh International's Midfield Terminal brought a new vision to the region for domestic and international air travel. Designed to be the nation's best gateway to international commerce, PIT is within a 90-minute flight of 70 percent of North America's population. Capacity is one of PIT's most valuable assets. A model to other airports around the world, the design of the terminal was planned to simplify aircraft movement on the airfield and ease pedestrian traffic to the gates.

Since opening, PIT's Midfield Terminal has been recognized on numerous occasions for its efficient and creative ways to assist travelers. PIT has become a major economic generator for southwestern Pennsylvania. And it continues to grow. In the last year, airlines have launched new service from PIT, new routes have been added, and development surrounding the airfield is growing.

==Passenger complex==
The Pittsburgh International Airport terminal complex is a series of three buildings linked by a variety of people moving transportation means. With the airplanes at one end and the parking lot at the other, travelers need only take a few steps to cross more than half a mile from the landside to airside terminal.

===Quick facts===
The Midfield Terminal opened in October of 1992. The cost of the complex was around $1 billion. The new terminal spans 2.1 million square feet with 69 domestic gates and 6 international gates. The airside terminal also includes the Airmall with more than 90 shops and restaurants.

===Landside Terminal===
[[Image:PITTicketing.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Pittsburgh's Landside Terminal]]
The landside terminal is the building closest to the parking areas. It includes ticketing, 11 baggage claim areas (6 for US Airways alone) <ref>http://www.pitairport.com/AirportGuideServlet?action=baggage</ref>, security checkpoints, and ground transportation such as taxi, limo, and rapid transit. There is a [http://pittsburghairport.hyatt.com Hyatt Regency Hotel]attached to the enclosed moving walkway. There is also shops in the lanside terminal including Au Bon Pain, Travelmart, Sue Venir, City of Bridges Cafe, and a baggage claim Travelmart. There are Travelers Aid desks on the transit and baggage claim levels as well as Airport Police Headquarters. Free [[Wi-Fi]] is also available throughout the landside terminal.

===Airside Terminal===
[[Image:mobile2.jpg|right|150px|thumb|"Pittsburgh" mobile in center core]]
The airside terminal consists of 4 concourses (A, B, C, D) that hold the departure gates <ref>http://www.pitairport.com/AirportGuideServlet?action=complete</ref>. In the center core is the majority of the Airmall shops (there is over 100 shops including GAP, Swarovski, Brighton Collectibles, Brooks Brothers, Body Shop, Godiva, Victoria's Secret, Sam Adams Brewery, Lids, Ben & Jerry's, PGA Tour Shop, GNC, Brookstone, Charley's Steakhouse and Eckerd's). On the mezzanine level are the [[US Airways Club]] and a chapel. The entire airport is also canvassed with free [[Wi-Fi]] <ref>http://www.pitairport.com/wifi.jsp</ref>. There is also [[Carnegie Science Center]] and Pittsburgh Aviation History Displays located throughout the airport.

==Parking==
Pittsburgh International offers on site parking operated by the Grant Oliver Corporation and patrolled by the [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny County]] Police. Grant Oliver offers usage of a GO FAST Pass account to pay for parking electronically at the airport.<ref>http://www.grantoliver.com/go_fast_pass.html]</ref> There are regular parking shuttles to the Long Term and Extended lots<ref>http://www.pitairport.com/ParkingServlet</ref> that can be accessed from the Baggage Claim level of the Landside Terminal outside doors six and eight. 

There are three options for parking: Short Term, Long Term, and Extended. The Short Term garage is attached to the Landside Terminal via the enclosed [[Escalator#Moving walkways|moving walkway]]. There are 2,100 spaces available. The Long Term section also quick access to the enclosed moving walkway. There are 3,100 spaces available here. The Extended section does not have access to the enclosed moving walkway but does have regular parking shuttles that can be accessed from the Baggage Claim level of the Landside Terminal outside doors six and eight. There are 8,000 spaces available in the Extended lot.<ref>http://www.pitairport.com/ParkingServlet</ref>

==General aviation==
The new Business Aviation Center (FBO Avcenter), located at the site of the former airport terminal building, is a modern and full service facility for management of corporate air travel and general aviation. This area is accessible by using Business 60 near [[Moon Township, Pennsylvania|Moon Township]].<ref>http://www.avports.com/pages/fbo_avcenters/fbo_pit.html</ref>

==Cargo==
The airport's nine cargo carriers account for over 200 million lbs (90 million kg) of freight per year<ref>[http://www.flypittsburgh.com/AboutUsServlet?option=pit_factsheet Pittsburgh International Airport: Fact Sheet]</ref>. Three cargo buildings provide more than 183,000 sq ft (17,000 m²) of warehouse capacity and over 450,000 sq ft (42,000 m²) of apron space.

The following major cargo airlines have regular cargo service to and from Pittsburgh International Airport.  Multiple destinations are served, the usual ones are noted:
*[[DHL]] 
*[[FedEx]] (Memphis)
**[[FedEx|FedEx Feeder]] operated by [[Wiggins Airways]] (Altoona, Cumberland, Johnstown, State College)
*[[UPS]] (Louisville, Philadelphia)

==Airline lounges==
Pittsburgh International houses only one airline club right now. [[US Airways]] has their [[US Airways Club]] on the mezzanine level of the airside terminal.<ref>http://www.usairways.com/awa/content/traveltools/club/locations.aspx#pit</ref> It is accessible by [[escalators]] in the center core area. Before the massive downsizing, US Airways had three clubs. The other two clubs were located down the A and B concourses. [[British Airways]] also had a lounge area in the C concourse during their trans-Atlantic flight operations from Pittsburgh (1980's to late 1990's). Their lounge room is still there intact but now closed off.

==Innovations==
Pittsburgh International has also been the first in the world in several key innovations.  Free [[Wi-Fi]] throughout a passenger terminal was introduced to world air travelers first at Pittsburgh International, a service that has been copied by several airports and airline terminals throughout the world since.<ref>[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/04057/277604.stm Wireless computer users rush to take advantage of free access, ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'' (2004-02-26)]</ref>  PIT was one of the first to deploy dozens of portable defibrillators,<ref>[http://www.early-defib.org/05_02_06202001.html Pittsburgh International Airport launches AED program, ''National Center for Early Defibrillation'' (2001-06-11)]</ref> is slated to be the first "Joint Readiness Center",<ref>[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05239/561132.stm Joint readiness center, ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'' (2005-08-27)]</ref> and developed the first volunteer ambassador program.<ref>http://www.flypittsburgh.com/AboutUsServlet?option=pit_ambasprog</ref> <ref>[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05239/561033.stm Airport ambassadors deploy to assist domestic travelers, ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'' (2005-08-27)]</ref>

[[Image:AIRMALL logo.gif|left|200px|thumb|Airmall Logo]]
The airmall at the airport also provided several world's firsts in both featuring fair "street prices" and being the first major and diverse shopping center located within an airport terminal,<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/travel/news/2003/09/25-airport-cities.htm New 'cities' springing up around many U.S. airports "USA Today" (2003-09-25)]</ref> as well as the first airport to have two Xpress Spas in its retail area. Pittsburgh International Airport also helped to innovate electronic parking with EZPass.<ref>[http://www.flypittsburgh.com/NewsEventsServlet?option=pressArchives&shortdescp=50 Pittsburgh International Airport: Press Releases (2004-10-11)]</ref> Pittsburgh was the first airport in the world to offer fare alert emails.<ref>[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/04040/270924.stm Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (2004-01-09]</ref> The airport innovated proactive emails on airfare discounts by carrier and destination weekly.

As of Monday April 16, 2007, people staying at the Hyatt Regency Hotel will get Airmall access. This includes both passengers and hotel guests as well. Guests wishing to use this service must request a pass at the front desk and they will contact the proper authority to get them a security pass. Those wishing to do so still have to go through the security checkpoint.<ref>[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07103/777778-100.stm]</ref>

Airport maintenance has also claimed world firsts for Pittsburgh International, developing one of the best winter weather operations in the nation with its unique front and rear deicing fleets and embedded runway sensors.  The first use of the front discharge spray bars during winter weather was at Pittsburgh.<ref>http://www.grounds-mag.com/snow_ice/2001_august_takeoff/</ref>  This innovative spirit among airport ground maintanance crews coupled with the abundance of runways and lengths, has given Pittsburgh the reputation in the industry as one of the few airports free of weather or winter delays.

Pittsburgh International was also the first airport in the Northeast and Midwest to offer service on both major discount carriers [[JetBlue Airways|jetBlue Airways]] and [[Southwest Airlines]].<ref>http://www.southwest.com/travel_center/routemap_dyn.html?ref=wwf_fgn</ref> <ref>http://www.jetblue.com/wherewefly/</ref>

==Runways==
[[Image:PITAirportDiag.png|right|150px|thumb|Runway Layout at PIT]]
Pittsburgh International Airport currently has four runways. The longest of the runways is 10R/ 28L at 11500 x 200 ft. (3505 x 61 m) and the shortest being 14/32 at 8101 x 150 ft. (2469 x 46 m). Runway 10R/ 28C is generally used for larger aircraft such as Boeing 747 and military operations. Runways 10R and 10L are equipped with Category III ILS ([[Instrument Landing System]]). 28R, 28L, and 32 have Category I ILS and 10C/ 28C has LOC/ GS.

Three of the four runways are parallel with the fourth crossing the southern two runways. In normal traffic patterns, landings are directed to runways 32, 28R, and 28L while aircraft takeoff on runways 28R and 28C. In reverse traffic pattern, landings are directed to runways 10R and 10L while aircraft takeoff on runway 10C. In heavy traffic situations, there can be two simultaneous landings on the outer runways while the center runway is used for a single takeoff. The runway setup also allows for very few weather and traffic related delays.

Due to a noise abatement program, runway 10L will never be used for takeoffs due to aircraft flying directly over heavy residential areas.

With PIT's large land area, it can easily accommodate up to eight runways. <ref>http://www.faa.gov/ats/asc/publications/CAPACITY/PIT.pdf</ref> At max capacity, there would be 6 parallel runways running east to west and 2 parallel runways running southeast to northwest.  The additional runways would have capacity lengths of 9,000 feet, 8,500 feet and two at 8,200 feet.

==Air Force==
Pittsburgh International, as a primarily commercial complex, may not strike the average flyer as a site rich in military aviation tradition.  Founded as a military base to answer the regions defense needs during World War II, the complex continues it's [[U.S. Air Force|Air Force]] legacy in reduced but still visible ways.  Pittsburgh International continues to serve as the headquarters for two Air Force units  ([[911th Airlift Wing]] on its northeastern side, and the  [[171st Air Refueling Wing]]), and the home base for the [[Pennsylvania Air National Guard]].  The airport hosts an average of 20 military flight operations per day in its role as host to the region's defense center.  
Although the Air Reserve and Air National Guard maintain a great presence on that corner of the complex, the shuttering of some of the Air Force facilities in recent decades has led to the growth of a new tenant for that equipment at Pittsburgh.  The [[FAA]] has taken over much of the excess cold-war era infrastructure that the Air Guard and Reserve no longer needs, making Pittsburgh recently an important regional center for the agency.  Pittsburgh's military heritage is also rekindled each summer as the complex hosts one of the largest air shows on the east coast, "Wings over Pittsburgh". Roughly 200,000 spectators attended the two-day show in 2005. <ref>http://www.wingsoverpittsburgh.com</ref>  The military end of the airport complex has also been mentioned as the best relocation site for the region's PX.  The 2008 scheduled closing of nearby Camp Raymond E. Kelley and it's PX has brought PIT the opportunity to host the facility on it's military side.

==Fire school training==
The Allegheny County Airport Authority Fire Bureau has opened a state of the art ARFF Training Center. This FAA regional training facility is the next generation in Aircraft Rescue Fire Fighting.

The B-757 mock-up, designed by Symtron System, Inc, offers realistic and challenging training while maintaining a safe work environment. The simulated tail engine offers ARFF personnel critical high engine training scenarios.

The year round training facility offers specialized sessions in cold climate training evolutions. The system is propane fueled and computer controlled. It features a number of burn scenarios including:

*12,280 square foot fuel spill burn area
*Wing engine fire
*Wheel/brake fire
*Gallery fire
*Cockpit fire
*Passenger Compartment fire
*Lavatory/Trash Receptacle fire
*Flashover simulation.

Adjacent to the first-training simulator is a four-story tower that houses the Computer Center overlooking the state-of-the-art training grounds. The Computer Control System ensures consistent repeatable evolutions for each trainee and allows training to be conducted with the utmost safety of participants in mind.

The facility is within the airport boundary and designed to be in an area that minimizes distractions. The classrooms, management center, vehicle bay, trainee/equipment support areas and visitors center are located directly adjacent to the training grounds. This layout maximizes training time for students by eliminating the need for unnecessary travel.

The use of propane and control of water run-off combine to reduce environmental impact while providing quality occupational education for fire fighters, emergency responders and industrial personnel in a safe and enjoyable manner.<ref>http://www.flypittsburgh.com/AboutUsServlet?option=pit_fireschool</ref>

[[Image:Egates3.jpg|right|thumb|Demolished Arm of the E gates]]
Concourse E had 22 gates: E1- E22

Concourse E was formerly used for US Airways Express commuter flights ([[turboprops]] and [[regional jets]]) until their consolidation into  Concourse A. The concourse is now used as an auxiliary security checkpoint. E Gates were intentionally placed as a part of the Landside check-in terminal for quick access to small bodied commuter planes; however they are not part of the main Airside terminal structure. All E gates are currently out of service to air traffic, they are also restricted to anyone except airport employees, and the airport and [[US Airways]] currently have no intentions of reopening the E terminal.  The airport has removed parts of the E Concourse to make room for a US Airways baggage sorting facility.

==Aircraft accidents==

*November 22, 2001 a corporate Learjet crashed after a rapid takeoff in which it went "nose-high" before the pilot lost control, both on board were killed.
*September 8, 1994 [[USAir Flight 427]], a 737-300, crashed on approach from [[Chicago O'Hare International Airport]]. All 132 people on board were killed.  It resulted in the longest and most thorough NTSB investigation in world history.  It was determined that a lock occured in rudder control that literally caused the plane to fall uncontrollably from 6,000 feet, Boeing has retrofitted every 737 because of the data gathered from this crash.  The plane crashed roughly 10 miles North-Northwest in Hopewell Township.
*April 1, 1956 TWA flight to Newark crashed about a half mile after taking off when the pilot and co-pilot did not immediately correct a small engine malfunction/fire.  Due to miscommunication and lack of focus it caused failure and a crash.  22 of 36 were killed.
