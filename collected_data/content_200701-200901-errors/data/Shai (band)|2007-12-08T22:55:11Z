'''Shai''' is an early [[1990s]] vocal [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]/[[soul music|soul]] [[quartet]]. Their biggest hit was an [[a cappella]] single, "[[If I Ever Fall in Love]]", which made #2 in the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Top 40]].

==Band history==

Shai was formed at [[Howard University]] in [[Washington D.C.]] Three of the four members, Marc Gay, Carl Martin, and Darnell Van Rensalier, belonged to the same fraternity, [[Alpha Phi Alpha]], and along with good friend, Garfield A. Bright (b. [[12 October]] [[1969]]), decided to take a chance at turning their hobby of singing into a career. While still in DC, Carl met a DJ from WPGC at a softball game and passed the demo, "If I Ever Fall in Love" to the DJ.  That same week the DJ played it on air.  Other stations soon followed, and suddenly the record labels came calling. After signing with [[MCA Records|Gasoline Alley]], Shai began putting together their debut album.

Carl E. Martin wrote the chart-busting single "If I Ever Fall In Love" on his long ride back from his home in Louisiana to Washington, DC.  The song was written about his ex-girlfriend Camille, who also attended Howard University. {{Fact|date=February 2007}} 

"If I Ever Fall in Love" was the first single and peaked at #2 in the U.S. The next two releases from the double-platinum album, "Comforter" and "Baby I'm Yours" both reached #10. The group's next CD was ''Right Back At Cha'', a remix album largely consisting of new versions of their previous hits. A revised version of the song "Baby I'm Yours" simply titled "Yours" was released from it, and peaked at #63. 

Shai returned in [[1994]] with "The Place Where You Belong", from the [[Beverly Hills Cop III]] soundtrack. It was the group's final Top 40 single. In late 1995 their followup album ''Blackface'' was released (#42 Pop, #15 R&B). It featured Shai's final R&B Top 20 single, "Come With Me" (#43 Pop). The group's last chart appearance was the followup single, [[1996]]'s #89 single "I Don't Wanna Be Alone" (the remix featuring [[Jay-Z]]), although they have continued to record. [[1999]]'s album ''Destiny'' was recorded without Carl Martin (who left the group after ''Blackface'' release), and their latest [[2004]] studio album ''Back From The Mystery System ... The Love Cycle'' was done with new Shai member - Erik Willis.

Shai made a guest appearance on a [[1992]] episode of ''[[Family Matters (TV series)|Family Matters]]'', during a dream sequence in which Laura Winslow fantasizes about the four young men in the band...until they all turn into doppelgangers of her nemesis, [[Steve Urkel]].

"If I Ever Fall In Love" was one of 12 songs [[American Idol]] contestants could choose to sing during Hollywood week of Season 5. There are several cover versions of this song, including ''If you ever'' by [[East 17]] feat. [[Gabrielle (singer)|Gabrielle]].

Their song "Yours" was used in [[Seaquest DSV]] episode "Brothers and Sisters" as the background music in a scene where [[Jonathan Brandis]] attempts to kiss [[Kellie Martin]]. See Seaquest DSV episode list Season One.
