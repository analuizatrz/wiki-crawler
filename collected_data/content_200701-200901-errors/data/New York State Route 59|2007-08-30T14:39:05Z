'''New York State Route 59''' is an east-west road in southern Rockland County in the State of New York. It runs from [[New York State Route 17]] at Exit 15A of the [[New York State Thruway]] in [[Ramapo, New York|Ramapo]] to [[U.S. Route 9W|US-9W]] in [[Nyack, New York|Nyack]]. In [[Suffern, New York]], it also shares a [[wrong-way concurrency]] with [[U.S. Route 202]] for 0.05 miles. 

==Route description==
{{sectstub}}
Route 59 always runs in close proximity to [[New York State Thruway|I-87-287]], except northwest of Suffern, where it only runs along the east side of [[Interstate 87|I-87]]. It runs on the south side of the Thruway between Suffern and [[Monsey, New York|Monsey]], crossing over to the north side at a bridge with no interchange in Monsey to Exit 14 on the Thruway in [[Nanuet, New York|Nanuet]], where it goes back on the south side and stays there until reaching [[Nyack, New York|Nyack]]. Motorists using Exit 11 join Route 59 which goes under the Thruway again to [[U.S. Route 9W]].

==Miscellanea==
The presence of grade-separated interchanges at NY 304, Strawtown Road ([[County Route 23 (Rockland County, New York)|CR 23]]), Western Highway ([[County Route 15 (Rockland County, New York)|CR 15]]) and [[New York State Route 303|NY 303]], along with the southern half of the formerly proposed '''Spring Valley Bypass''', indicates that it may have been proposed at one time as a toll-free alternative to the Thruway for local, limited-access traffic. Route 59 used to go further east along '''Main Street''' in Nyack to '''North Broadway'''.
