'''Kevin Brereton''', better known by his [[stage name]] '''k-os''', is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[rapping|rapper]], singer, songwriter and record producer. His [[given name]] may also be cited as '''Kheaven''', a spelling he later adopted.

The alias "k-os" is pronounced "chaos" and is an [[acronym]] for "[[Self-knowledge|Knowledge of Self]]," although in a later interview he also said that it used to stand for "Kheaven's Original Sound." His music incorporates a wide variety of music genres including but not limited to [[hip hop music|rap]], [[funk]], [[rock music|rock]], and [[reggae]]. The lyrics frequently focus on promoting a "positive message" while at times expressing criticism of mainstream hip hop culture's obsession with money, fame and glorification of violence.<ref name="bill">

k-os received his first musical exposure with the single "Musical Essence", released in 1993. After the release of his second single "Rise Like The Sun" in 1996 he withdrew from the industry because he was dissatisfied with his musical style. He reappeared briefly in 1999 and released his debut album ''[[Exit (k-os album)|Exit]]'' in 2002. The album received positive reviews but sold relatively few copies. He released his second album ''[[Joyful Rebellion]]'' in 2004, which received [[Platinum album|platinum]] status in Canada. ''Joyful Rebellion'' received positive reviews, but at times was criticized for speaking extensively on the state of hip hop. k-os' third album, ''[[Atlantis: Hymns for Disco]]'', was released in 2006.

==Early life and childhood==
K-os was born at [[St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto|St. Michael's Hospital]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] on February 20, 1972. He and his two younger brothers Joshua and Andrew Richard were raised by [[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidadian]] [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] parents. His father was a [[minister]] at two congregations in the [[Greater Toronto Area]].<ref name="now1">

==Music career==

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:kos-sundaymorning.JPG|thumb|200px|k-os' latest single '''Sunday Morning''''s cover.]] -->

While attending York University, k-os gained his first exposure in the music industry in 1993 when he released the single "Musical Essence" {{audio|K-os - Musical Essence.ogg|sample}} with a music video financed by a [[VideoFACT]] grant. The video can be viewed [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMWJzKZIGFA here]. He dropped out of the university shortly afterwards. The single was produced with friends Clarence Gruff and Kevin Risto; currently, Risto is one half of the production duo known as [[Midi Mafia]] (produced the [[50 Cent]] single "[[21 Questions]]").<ref name="ottawa" /> After winning a [[MuchMusic Video Award]] for the single, k-os was noticed by [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] player [[John Salley]], who became his manager. With the single gaining moderate success, k-os was invited to perform in the 1995 ''Hip-Hop Explosion Tour'', with other Canadian acts such as [[Rascalz]] and [[Ghetto Concept]]. Salley and [[Raphael Saadiq]] began work with k-os on his planned debut ''Missing Links'',<ref name="youth" /> eventually releasing his second single "Rise Like the Sun" in 1996. k-os suddenly withdrew from the music industry in 1996 after receiving an offer from [[BMG]]. k-os would later say that during this time he had already completed several albums but was dissatisfied with his music. He described his music as "pretentious and derivative," and stated at the time that he was "still trying to figure out who he was."<ref name="now1" />

He continued to live with his manager Salley in [[Los Angeles]]. Soon after, Red1 of the [[Rascalz]], who k-os befriended at the 1995 ''Explosion Tour'', invited him to move to [[Vancouver]]. There he contributed a verse and chorus lines to the Rascalz ''Global Warning'' album, released in 1999. k-os returned to the music scene by performing at the [[North by Northeast]] music festival in 1999. He took stage with the Vancouver band Namedropper.<ref name="now1" /> 

Inspired by [[Michael Jackson]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]], [[The Beatles]], [[The Roots]] and [[Stevie Wonder]], k-os worked on a new debut album. He described his new musical focus on "doing stuff really obscure and making music for myself."<ref >{{cite web

In a relatively quiet dispute, some lyrics from the single "B-Boy Stance" were interpreted as an insult on the Toronto-based rapper [[K'naan]]. In the single, k-os rapped "They took cameras to Africa for pictures to rhyme / Over; Oh, yes, the great pretenders," and "Religious entertainers who want to be life savers." K’naan interpreted the lyrics as being aimed at him filming the music video for the single ''Soobax'' in [[Kenya]]. Friends say that k-os was simply expressing ideas about the LoveMovement (his videproduction team) who shot the video in Kenya and ex manager Sol guy who was managing K'naan at the time. k-os has been said to believe that hip hop allows friends to express their ideas to each other via song. He was very puzzled by Knaan's personal 'public' angle on the lyrics of "B-Boy Stance" especially because his song Revolutionary Avacado came after Knaan's repeated efforts to collaborate with k-os. Later on k-os told younger brother Josh that he believed it was a way for K'naan to 'get attention' very close to the release date of his album and that Sol guy who k-os left to be Managed by Chris Smith management pit the two against each other<ref name="beef">{{cite web

K’naan responded in the song "Revolutionary Avocado" with the lyrics: "You the all-knowing with a beer bottle / Wishing you was Plato and me Aristotle? / ...Suburban negro turned hip-hop hero / Is there a reason he really hates me, though?".<ref name="beef" /> Furthermore K'naan stated in an interview that he thought "k-os was out of line."<ref name="beef" /> The two have since spoken and there is no conflict.

A documentary chronicling the production and performance of the song aired on Canadian national television on February 2, 2006 and was titled after the song. k-os then traveled across Canada recording his third album, stopping mainly in Toronto, Vancouver and [[Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Halifax]]. In the proceeding summer, the first single from the upcoming album titled "ELEctrick Heat - the seekwiLL" was released. The single became the "#1 most downloaded Single of the Week" on iTunes.<ref name="virgin" /> During the year, k-os also recorded a version of [[John Lennon]]'s song "[[Jealous Guy]]" for the ''Make Some Noise'' campaign of the [[human rights]] organization [[Amnesty International]]. 

Before the release of his third album, ''Atlantis: Hymns For Disco'', k-os wrote derogatory comments on his [[MySpace]] page aimed at Jason Richards, a contributing writer at Toronto's ''[[NOW (magazine)|NOW]]'' magazine, for his review of the album. k-os stated that he was angered by Richards referring to him in the review as a "crossover pop artist disguised as a true-school b-boy".He was also disillusioned when he remembered he had granted an interview to Richards when he was a teenager, and that they had similar small town Trinidadian upbringings. Nervousness about the experimental nature of Atlantis and the passive aggressiveness of Canadian media most likely led to his blow up.<ref>

Part of the comment called Richards "a black man ... manipulated by his indie rock nerd bosses"<ref name="can"> it was speculated that this comment was inspired by k-os realization that Richard's review of Atlantis mirrored a review of his previous work JoyfuL RebelLion by his boss Tim Perlich years before. k-os saw it as the same review coming from different lips.
