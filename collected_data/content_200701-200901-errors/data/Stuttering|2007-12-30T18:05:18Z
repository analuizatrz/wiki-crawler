'''Stuttering''', also known as '''stammering''' in the [[United Kingdom]], is a [[speech disorder]] in which the flow of [[Speech communication|speech]] is disrupted by involuntary repetitions and prolongations of sounds, syllables, words or phrases, and involuntary silent pauses or blocks in which the stutterer is unable to produce sounds. 'Verbal non-fluency' is the accepted{{Fact|date=September 2007}} umbrella term for such [[speech impediment]]s. The term ''stuttering'' is most commonly associated with involuntary sound repetition, but it also encompasses the abnormal hesitation or pausing before speech, referred to by stutterers as ''blocks'', and the prolongation of certain sounds, usually [[vowel]]s. Much of what constitutes "stuttering" cannot be noted by the listener; this includes such things as sound and word fears, situational fears, anxiety, tension, [[self-pity]], stress, shame, and a feeling of "loss of control" during speech. The emotional state of the individual who stutters in response to the stuttering often constitutes the most difficult aspect of the disorder.  The term "stuttering", as popularly used, covers a wide spectrum of severity: it may encompass individuals with barely perceptible impediments, for whom the disorder is largely cosmetic, as well as others with extremely severe symptoms, for whom the problem can effectively prevent most oral communication.

Stuttering is generally not a problem with the physical production of speech sounds or putting thoughts into words. Despite popular perceptions to the contrary, stuttering does not affect and has no bearing on intelligence. Apart from their speech impediment, people who stutter may well be 'normal' in the clinical sense of the term. Anxiety, low self-esteem, nervousness, and stress therefore do not cause stuttering ''per se'', although they are very often the result of living with a highly stigmatized disability and, in turn, exacerbate the problem. 

The disorder is also ''variable'', which means that in certain situations, such as talking on the telephone, the stuttering might be more severe or less, depending on the anxiety level connected with that activity. Although the exact [[etiology]] of stuttering is unknown, both [[genetics]] and [[neurophysiology]] are thought to contribute. Although there are many treatments and [[speech therapy]] techniques available that may help increase [[fluency]] in some stutterers, there is essentially no "cure" for the disorder at present.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

==Classification==
Developmental stuttering is stuttering that originates when a child is learning to speak and develops as the child matures into adulthood. Other speech disorders with symptoms resembling stuttering are [[cluttering]], [[Parkinson's disease#Motor symptoms|Parkinson's speech]], [[essential tremor]], [[spasmodic dysphonia]] and [[social anxiety]].

==Characteristics==
===Primary behaviors===
Primary stuttering behaviors are the overt, observable signs of speech fluency breakdown, including repeating sounds, syllables, words or phrases, silent blocks and prolongation of sounds. These differ in from the normal disfluencies found in all speakers in that that stuttering disfluencies may last longer, occur more frequently, and are produced with more effort and strain.<ref name="Ward5–6">Ward (2006), pp. 5–6.</ref>  Stuttering disfluencies also vary in quality: normal disfluencies tend to be a repetition of words, phrases or parts of phrases, while stuttering is characterized by prolongations, blocks and part-word repetitions.<ref> Kalinowksi and Saltuklaroglu (2006), pp. 31–37.</ref>  
*'''Repetition''' occurs when a ''unit of speech'', such as a sound, syllable, word, or phrase is repeated and are typical in children who are beginning to stutter. 
*'''Prolongations''' are the unnatural lengthening of [[continuant]] sounds, for example,"mmmmmmmmmilk".  Prolongations are also common in children beginning to stutter.
*'''Blocks''' are inappropriate cessation of sound and air, often associated with freezing of the movement of the tongue, lips and/or vocal folds. Blocks often develop later, and can be associated with muscle tension and effort.<ref name="Guitar14–15">Guitar (2005), pp. 14–15</ref>

===Secondary behaviors===
Secondary stuttering behaviors are unrelated to speech production and are learned behaviors which become linked to the primary behaviors. 

Secondary behaviors include escape behaviors, in which a stutterer attempts to terminate a moment of stuttering. Examples might be physical movements such as sudden loss of eye contact, eye-blinking, head jerks, hand tapping, interjected "starter" sounds and words, such as "um," "ah," "you know".<ref name="Ward6–7">Ward (2006), pp. 6–7</ref><ref name="Guitar16">Guitar (2005), p. 16</ref>  In many cases, these devices work at first, and are therefore reinforced, becoming a habit that is subsequently difficult to break.<ref name="Guitar16"/>

Secondary behaviors also refer to the use of avoidance strategies such avoiding specific words, people or situations that the person finds difficult. Some stutterers successfully use extensive avoidance of situations and words to maintain fluency and may have little or no evidence of primary stuttering behaviors.  Such covert stutterers often have high levels of anxiety, and extreme fear of even the most mild disfluency.<ref name="Ward6–7"/>

===Variability===
The severity of a stutter is often not constant even for severe stutterers.  Stutterers commonly report dramatically increased fluency when talking in unison with another speaker, copying another's speech, whispering, singing, and acting or when talking to pets, young children, or themselves.<ref> Ward (2006), pp. 13–14</ref>  Other situations, such as public speaking and speaking on the telephone are often greatly feared by stutterers, and increased stuttering reported.<ref> Ward (2006), p. 14</ref>

===Feelings and attitudes===
Stuttering may have a significant negative cognitive and affective impact on the stutterer.  In a famous analogy, Joseph Sheehan, a prominent researcher in the field, compared stuttering to an iceberg, with the overt aspects of stuttering above the waterline, and the larger mass of negative emotions invisible below the surface.<ref> Kalinowski and Saltuklaroglu (2006), p. 17</ref> Feelings of embarrassment, shame, frustration, fear, anger guilt are frequent in stutterers,<ref> Ward (2006), p. 179</ref> and may actually increase tension and effort, leading to increased stuttering.<ref name="Guitar16–7"> Guitar (2005), pp. 16–7</ref>  With time, continued exposure to difficult speaking experiences may crystallize into a negative self-concept and self-image. A stutterer may project his attitudes onto others, believing that they think he is nervous or stupid. Such negative feelings and attitudes may need to be a major focus of a treatment program.<ref name="Guitar16–7"/>

==Sub-types==
===Developmental===
Stuttering is typically a [[developmental disorder]] beginning in early childhood and continuing into adulthood at least 20% of children of those affected.<ref name="gordon">{{cite journal |author=Gordon N |title=Stuttering: incidence and causes |journal=Developmental medicine and child neurology |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=278–81 |year=2002 |pmid=11995897 |doi= }}</ref><ref name="craig2005">{{cite journal |author= Craig A, Tran Y|title=The epidemiology of stuttering: The need for reliable estimates of prevalence and anxiety levels over the lifespan|journal= Advances in Speech–Language Pathology |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=41–46 |year=2005 |pmid=17429528 |doi=}}</ref>  The mean onset of stuttering is 30 months.<ref name="fn 30"/>
Although there is variability, early stuttering behaviours usually consist of word or syllable repetitions, and secondary behaviours such as tension, avoidance or escape behaviours are absent.<ref name="Ward13"> Ward (2006), p. 13</ref>  Most young children are unaware of the interruptions in their speech.<ref name="Ward13"/> With early stutterers, disfluency may to be episodic, and periods of stuttering are followed by periods of relative fluency.<ref> Ward (2006), pp. 114–5</ref>   
Though the rate of early recovery is very high,<ref name="gordon"/> with time a young stutterer may transition from easy, relaxed repetition to more tense and effortful stuttering, including blocks and prolongations.<ref name="Ward13"/>  Some propose that parental reaction may affect the development of chronic stutter.  Recommendations to slow down, take a breath, say it again, etc may increase the child’s anxiety and fear, leading to more difficulties with speaking and, in the “cycle of stuttering” to ever yet more fear, anxiety and expectation of stuttering.<ref> Ward (2006), pp. 13, 115</ref>  With time secondary stuttering including escape behaviours such eye blinking, lip movements, etc. may be used, as well as fear and avoidance of sounds, words, people, or speaking situations.  Eventually, many become fully aware of their disorder and begin to identify themselves as "stutterers." With this may come deeper frustration, embarrassment and shame.<ref> Ward (2006), pp. 115–116</ref>  
Other, rarer, pattern of stuttering development have been described, including sudden onset with the child being unable to speak, despite attempts to do so.  The child usually blocks silently of the first sound of a sentence, and shows high levels of awareness and frustration.  Another variety also begins suddenly with frequent word and phrase repetition, and do not develop secondary stuttering behaviours.<ref> Ward (2006), pp. 117–119</ref>

===Acquired===
In rare cases, stuttering may be acquired in adulthood as the result of a neurological event such as a head injury, tumour, stroke or drug abuse/misuse. The stuttering has different characteristics from its developmental equivalent: it tends to be limited to part-word or sound repetitions, and is associated with a relative lack of anxiety and secondary stuttering behaviors. Techniques such as altered auditory feedback (see below) which may promote fluency in stutterers with the developmental condition, are not effective with the acquired type.<ref name="craig2005"/><ref name="gordon"/><ref> Ward (2006), pp. 4, 332–335</ref> 

Psychogenic stuttering may also arise after a traumatic experience such as a bereavement, the breakup of a relationship or as the psychological reaction to physical trauma. Its symptoms tend to be homogeneous: the stuttering is of sudden onset and associated with a significant events, it is constant and uninfluenced that different speaking situations, and there is initial little awareness or concern shown by the speaker in their speech.<ref> Ward (2006), pp. 4, 332, 335–337 </ref>

==Causes of developmental stuttering==
No single, exclusive cause of developmental stuttering is known. A variety of hypotheses and theories suggest multiple factors contributing to stuttering.<ref name="gordon"/>   
Among these is the strong evidence that stuttering has a genetic basis.<ref name="Guitar5–6">Guitar (2005), pp. 5–6</ref> Children who have first-degree relatives who stutter are three times as likely to develop a stutter.<ref>Ward (2006), p. 11</ref> However, twin and adoption studies suggest that genetic factors interact with environmental factors for stuttering to occur,<ref name="Guitar66">Guitar (2005), p. 66</ref> and forty to seventy percent of stutterers have no family history of the disorder.<ref>Guitar (2005), p. 39</ref>
There is evidence that stuttering is more common in children who also have concomitant speech, language, learning or motor difficulties.<ref>Ward (2006), p. 12</ref>

In some stutterers, congenital factors may play a role.  These may include physical trauma at or around birth, including cerebral palsy, retardation, or stressful situations, such as the birth of a sibling, moving, or a sudden growth in linguistic ability.<ref name="Guitar66"/><ref name="Guitar5–6"/>  

There is clear empirical evidence for structural and functional differences in the brains of stutterers. Research is complicated somewhat by the possibility that such differences could be the consequences of stuttering rather than a cause, but recent research on older children confirm structural differences thereby giving strength to the argument that at least some of the differences are not a consequence of stuttering.<ref name="watkins">{{cite journal |author=Watkins Kate|title= Structural and functional abnormalities of the motor system in developmental stuttering. |journal=Brain |year=2007 |pmid=17928317 |doi= }}</ref><ref name="chang">{{cite journal |author=Chang Soo-Eun|title= Brain anatomy differences in childhood stuttering. |journal=NeuroImage |year=2007 |pmid=|doi= }}</ref>

Auditory processing deficits have also been proposed as a cause of stuttering. Stuttering is less prevalent in deaf and hard of hearing individuals,<ref>Ward (2006), pp. 46–7</ref> and stuttering may be improved when auditory feedback is altered, such as masking, [[delayed auditory feedback]] (DAF), or frequency altered feedback.<ref>Ward (2006), p. 58</ref><ref name="gordon"/> There is some evidence that the functional organization of the auditory cortex may be different in stutterers.<ref name="gordon"/> 

There is evidence of differences in linguistic processing between stutterers and non-stutterers.<ref>Ward (2006), p. 43</ref> Brain scans of adult stutterers have found increased activation of the right hemisphere, which is associated with emotions, than in the left hemisphere, which is associated with speech. In addition reduced activation in the left auditory cortex has been observed.<ref name="gordon"/><ref name="Guitar66"/>  

The capacities and demands model has been proposed to account for the heterogeneity of the disorder. In this approach, speech performance varies depending on the capacity that the individual has for producing fluent speech, and the demands placed upon the person by the speaking situation.  Capacity for fluent speech, which may affected by a predisposition to the disorder, auditory processing or motor speech deficits, and cognitive or affective issues.  Demands may be increased by internal factors such as lack of confidence or self esteem or inadequate language skills or external factors such as peer pressure, time pressure, stressful speaking situations, insistence on perfect speech etc. In stuttering, the severity of the disorder is seen as likely to increase when demands placed on the person's speech and language system is exceeded by their capacity to deal to these pressures.<ref>Ward (2006), pp. 16–21</ref>

==Treatment==

===Fluency shaping therapy===
Fluency shaping therapy, also known as "speak more fluently" or "prolonged speech", trains stutterers to speak fluently by controlling their breathing, phonation, and articulation (lips, jaw, and tongue).  It is based on [[operant conditioning]] techniques.<ref> Ward (2006), p. 257 </ref> 

Stutterers are trained to reduce their speaking rate by stretching vowels and consonants, and using other fluency techniques such as continuous airflow and soft speech contacts. The result is very slow, monotonic, but fluent speech used only in the speech clinic. After the stutterer masters these fluency skills, the speaking rate and intonation are increased gradually. This more normal-sounding, fluent speech is then transferred to daily life outside the speech clinic, though lack of speech naturalness at the end of treatment remains a frequent criticism.  Fluency shaping approaches are often taught in intensive group therapy programs, which may take two to three weeks to complete, but more recently the Camperdown program, using a much shorter schedule, has been shown to be effective.<ref> Ward (2006), pp. 257–67 </ref>

===Stuttering modification therapy===
The goal of stuttering modification therapy is not to eliminate stuttering but to modify it so that stuttering is easier and less effortful.<ref> Ward (2006), p. 253</ref>  The rationale is that since fear and anxiety causes increased stuttering, using easier stuttering and with less fear and avoidance, stuttering will decrease.  The most widely known approach was published by Charles Van Riper in 1973 and is also known as block modification therapy.<ref> Ward (2006), p. 245</ref>

As proposed by Van Riper, stuttering modification therapy has four overlapping stages:<ref> Ward (2006), pp. 247–53</ref>

*In the first stage, called identification, the stutterer and clinician identify the core behaviors, secondary behaviors, and feelings and attitudes that characterize the stuttering.
*In the second stage, called desensitization, the stutterer works to reduce fear and anxiety by freezing stuttering behaviors, confronting difficult sounds, words and situations, and intentionally stuttering ("voluntary stuttering").
*In the third stage, called modification, the stutterer learns "easy stuttering." This is done by "cancellations" (stopping in a dysfluency, pausing a few moments, and saying the word again); "pull-outs," or pulling out of a dysfluency into fluent speech; and "preparatory sets," or looking ahead for words one may stutter on, and using "easy stuttering" on those words.
*In the fourth stage, called stabilization, the stutterer prepares practice assignments, makes preparatory sets and pull-outs automatic, and changes their self-concept from being a person who stutters to being a person who speaks fluently most of the time but who occasionally stutters mildly.

===Electronic fluency devices===
{{seealso|Electronic fluency devices}}
Altered auditory feedback, so that stutterers hears their voice differently, has been used for over 50 years in the treatment of stuttering.<ref name="bothe2007">{{cite journal |author=
 Bothe AK, Finn P, Bramlett RE |title=Pseudoscience and the SpeechEasy: Reply to Kalinowski, Saltuklaroglu, Stuart, and Guntupalli (2007)|journal= American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology |volume=16 |issue= |pages=77–83 |year=2007 |pmid=17329678 |doi=}}</ref>  Altered auditory feedback effect can be produced by speaking in chorus with another person, by providing blocking out the stutterer's voice while talking (masking), by delaying the stutterer's voice slightly (delayed auditory feedback) and/or by altering the frequency of the feedback (frequency altered feedback).  Studies of these techniques have had mixed results, with some stutterers showing substantial reductions in stuttering, while others improved only slightly or not at all.<ref name="bothe2007"/>  In a 2006 review of the efficacy of stuttering treatments, none of the studies on altered auditory feedback met the criteria for experimental quality, such as the presence of control groups.<ref name =Bothe2006I>{{cite journal |author=Bothe AK,Davidow JH, Bramlett RE, Ingham RJ |title=Stuttering Treatment Research 1970-2005: I.

===Anti-stuttering medications===
The effectiveness of pharmacological agents, such as [[anti-convulsant]]s, [[anti-depressants]], [[antipsychotic]] and [[antihypertensive]] medications, and [[dopamine antagonists]] in the treatment of stuttering has been evaluated in studies involving both adults and children.<ref name =Bothe2006>{{cite journal |author=Bothe AK, Davidow JH, Bramlett RE, Franic DM, Ingham RJ |title=Stuttering Treatment Research 1970-2005: II.

A comprehensive review of pharmacological treatments of stuttering in 2006 concluded that few of the drug trials were methodologically sound.<ref name =Bothe2006/>  Of those that were, only one, not unflawed study,<ref name="fn 12"> {{cite journal |author=Maguire GA, Riley GD, Franklin DL, Gottschalk LA |title=Risperidone for the treatment of stuttering |journal=Journal of clinical psychopharmacology |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=479–82 |year=2000 |pmid=10917410 |doi=}}</ref> showed a reduction in stuttering to less than 5%. In addition, potentially serious side effects of pharmacological treatments were noted.<ref name =Bothe2006/>

==Prognosis==
Among preschoolers, the prognosis for recovery is good.  Based on research, about 65% of preschoolers who stutter recover spontaneously in the first two years of stuttering,<ref name="fn 30">{{cite journal |author=Yairi E, Ambrose N |title=Onset of stuttering in preschool children: selected factors |journal=Journal of speech and hearing research |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=782–8 |year=1992 |pmid=1405533 |doi=}}</ref><ref name="fn 31">Yairi E (1993).

Once stuttering has become established, and the child has developed secondary behaviors, the prognosis is more guarded,<ref name="Guitar7"/> and only 18% of children who stutter after five years recover spontaneously.<ref name=fn 32">{{cite journal |author=Andrews G, Craig A, Feyer AM, Hoddinott S, Howie P, Neilson M |title=Stuttering: a review of research findings and theories circa 1982 |journal=The Journal of speech and hearing disorders |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=226–46 |year=1983 |pmid=6353066 |doi=}}</ref> However, with treatment young children may be left with little evidence of stuttering.<ref name="Guitar7"/> 

With adult stutterers, there is no known cure,<ref name="Ward16"/> though they may make partial recovery with intervention. Stutterers often learn to stutter less severely and be less affected emotionally, though others may make no progress with therapy.<ref name="Guitar7"/>

==History and cultural aspects==
{{seealso|Cultural references to stuttering}}
For centuries stuttering has featured prominently in [[society]] at large. Because of the unusual-sounding speech that is produced, as well as the behaviors and attitudes that accompany a stutter, stuttering has been a subject of scientific interest, curiosity, discrimination, and ridicule. Stuttering was, and essentially still is, a riddle with a long history of interest and speculation into its causes and cures. Stutterers can be traced back centuries to the likes of [[Demosthenes]], who tried to control his disfluency by speaking with pebbles in his mouth.<ref name=brosch>{{cite journal |author=Brosch S, Pirsig W |title=Stuttering in history and culture |journal=Int. J. Pediatr. Otorhinolaryngol. |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=81–7 |year=2001 |pmid=11378182 |doi= }}</ref> The [[Talmud]] interprets  [[Bible]] passages to indicate [[Moses]] was also a stutterer, and that placing a burning coal in his mouth had caused him to be "slow and hesitant of speech" (Exodus 4, v.10)<ref name=brosch/> 

[[Galen]]'s humoral theories remained influential in Europe into the Middle Ages and beyond. In this theory, stuttering was  attributed to imbalances of the [[four bodily humors]]: yellow bile, blood, black bile, and phlegm. [[Hieronymus Mercurialis]], writing in the sixteenth century, proposed methods to redress the imbalance including changes in diet, reduced lovemaking (in men only), and [[purging]]. Believing that fear aggravated stuttering, he suggested techniques to overcome this.  Humoral manipulation continued to be a dominant treatment for stuttering until the eighteenth century.<ref name="rieber">{{cite journal |author=Rieber RW, Wollock J |title=The historical roots of the theory and therapy of stuttering |journal=Journal of communication disorders |volume=10 |issue=1-2 |pages=3–24 |year=1977 |pmid=325028 |doi=}}</ref>
Partly due to a perceived lack of intelligence because of his stutter, the man who became the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Claudius]] was initially shunned from the public eye and excluded from public office.<ref name=brosch/>

In eighteenth and nineteeth century Europe, surgical interventions for stuttering were recommended, including cutting  the tongue with scissors, removing a triangular wedge from the posterior tongue, cutting nerves, and neck and lip muscles. Others recommended shortening the uvula or removing the tonsils. All were abandoned due to the high danger of bleeding to death and their failure to stop stuttering. Less drastically, [[Jean Marc Gaspard Itard]] placed a small forked golden plate under the tongue in order to support "weak" muscles. <ref name=brosch/>

[[Image:Notker Balbulus 2.jpg|thumb|left|Notker Balbulus, from a medieval manuscript.]]
Italian [[pathologist]] [[Giovanni Battista Morgagni|Giovanni Morgagni]] attributed stuttering to deviations in the [[hyoid bone]], a conclusion he came to via [[autopsy]].<ref name="rieber"/>
Blessed [[Notker of St. Gall]] (ca. 840–912), called Balbulus (“The Stutterer”) and described by his biographer as being "delicate of body but not of mind, stuttering of tongue but not of intellect, pushing boldly forward in things Divine," was invoked against stammering.
Other famous Englishmen who stammered were King [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]] and Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], who led the UK through World War II. Although George VI went through years of speech therapy for his stammer, Churchill thought that his own very mild stutter added an interesting element to his voice: "Sometimes a slight and not unpleasing stammer or impediment has been of some assistance in securing the attention of the audience…"<ref name="fn 10">{{cite web | title=Churchill: A Study in Oratory | work=The Churchill Centre | url=http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=814 | accessdate=2005-04-05}}</ref>

For centuries "cures" such as consistently drinking water from a snail shell for the rest of one's life, "hitting a stutterer in the face when the weather is cloudy", strengthening the tongue as a muscle, and various [[Herbalism|herbal remedies]] were used.<ref name="fn 6">{{cite web | author = Kuster, Judith Maginnis | title=Folk Myths About Stuttering | work=Minnesota State University | date = [[April 1]], [[2005]] | url= http://www.mnsu.edu/comdis/kuster/Infostuttering/folkmyths.html | accessdate=2005-04-03}}</ref>  Similarly, in the past people have subscribed to theories about the causes of stuttering which today are considered odd. Proposed causes of stuttering have included  [[tickling]] an infant too much, eating improperly during [[breastfeeding]], allowing an infant to look in the mirror, cutting a child's hair before the child spoke his or her first words, having too small a tongue, or the "work of the devil."<ref name="fn 6"/>
