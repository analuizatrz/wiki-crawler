The '''Strider [[United States Special Operations Command#Marine Corps|MARSOC]] SMF''' is a framelock folding [[knife]] that was specifically developed for the [[USMC]]'s first [[United States Special Operations Command|SOCOM]] Unit:  [[MCSOCOM Detachment One|Detachment 1]].  The Strider SMF was the first knife issued to an individual [[US Marine Corps]] unit in over 60 years and the first Tactical Folder issued within the USMC. 

==Materials and Construction==
The SMF knife is manufactured by Strider Knives of [[San Marcos, California]].<ref name="Larsen">Larsen, John A.(2003)"Strider Marine Special Ops Folder", ''Tactical Knives Magazine'', September </ref>   The knife features a 4" [[drop point]] flat ground tiger striped blade of S30V steel.  The handle is composed of a fire annodized [[titanium]] frame, oil impregnated bronze bushings, an oversized pivot screw 0.19" in diameter, and a textured G10 fiberglass scale with an incorporated backspacer.<ref name="Gardner">Gardner, James. (2005)"Duel of the Titans: two exceptional folders exemplify state-of-the-art",''Guns Magazine'', June 2005.</ref>  The National Stock Number ([[NSN]]) for the SMF knife is 1095-01-531-5015.<ref name="Cascio">Cascio, Pat. (2007)"The Strider Folder",''Knives Illustrated'', June 2007, Vol21, N 3, pp 47-51.</ref>

The latest version of this knife (generation 2 and above) includes the Hinderer Lockbar Stabilizer, a mechanism designed by custom knifemaker Rick Hinderer and licensed for use by Strider.<ref name="Cascio"/>  The lockbar stabilizer is a metal disc contained in the titanium lockbar which is designed to preserve the life of the framelock by preventing overtravel and flex.<ref name="Cascio"/>   The original knives designed for the Marines' SOCOM unit in 2003 do not include this feature, but subsequent versions do.<ref name="Cascio"/>

==MARSOC Version==
The last time the [[US Marines]] issued a [[knife]] to an individual unit was in [[1942]] when a variation of the [[Fairbairn-Sykes fighting knife]] was redesigned by Lieutenant Colonel Clifford H. Shuey and produced by the [[Camillus Cutlery Company]] of [[Camillus, New York]].  That knife was called the US Marine Raider [[Stiletto]] and was issued to [[Marine Raiders]] until the unit was disbanded in [[1944]].<ref name="swat">Rogers, Patrick A.(2003)"Marines New SOCOM Pistol", ''SWAT Magazine'', December 2003 page 52</ref><sup id="fn_1_back">[[#fn 1|1]]</sup>

When DET-1 was formed and their equipment being chosen they decided  not to use the traditional Marine [[Ka-Bar]] nor did they go with a dagger design as the Marine Raiders had been issued 60 years previously.  Instead they chose Strider's SMF folding knife as their issued blade.<ref name="MCT">Raiding the Past: New spec-ops unit harks back to WWII Raider battalions, ''Marine Corps Times'', October 2003</ref>  

The MARSOC SMF knife is marked with the date of the Marine unit's activation (030620 or June 20, 2003) as well as "DET-1" on the frame. In addition, the Military version bears the insignia of the [[Marine Raiders]].<ref name="smf">"Model #SMF: Strider Knives", ''American Handgunner Magazine'', March 2004</ref><ref name="Cascio"/>   

The initial run of this model consisted of 300 knives.<ref name="Cascio"/>   150 for the men in the unit and 150 similarly marked knives for collectors whose purchase offset the cost of the knives for the military.<ref name="haskew">Haskew, Mike.(2006)"At the Heart of the World Class", ''Blade Magazine'', Volume 31, Issue 5.</ref><ref name="Cascio"/>   There are several small differences between the military and civilian versions of this knife.<ref name="Larsen"/>  The Military issued knives began with an "M" in the serial number, whereas the civilian counterpart was preceded by a "C" in the serial number. The Marine version also features a Coyote Brown colored G-10 scale and backspacer, whereas the Civilian version's scale and backspacer is made of black G-10.  The Civilian version also lacks the Marine Raider Insignia which is stamped on the blade of the Marine version.<ref name="Larsen"/>

After rigorous field testing, including parachute jumps, the unit's Commanding Officer, Colonel Robert Coates remarked that the knife was "selected by, built for, and issued to the Marine Corps SOCOM Detachment."<ref>Haskew, Mike.(2006)"The Big Uglies", ''Blade Magazine'', Volume 31, Issue 9.

* <cite id="fn_1">[[#fn 1 back|Note 1:]] </cite>According to Pat Rogers: "An example of this is the fact that for only the second time in Marine Corps history, a knife was selected by, built for and issued to a specific Marine Corps unit—the Strider MCSOCCOM.  The Marine Raiders of the Second World War, from which the Det has traced its lineage, were the first to have a knife made for them. This was the USMC Stiletto, made by Camillus Cutlery, a copy of the Fairbairn-Sykes Fighting Knife, with 14,370 made. (The second Raider Bn adopted the Collins #18 Bowie knife—a commercial knife not made especially for them. Commonly called the “Gung Ho” knife, less than one thousand were issued."
