[[Image: celeborn11.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Celeborn]] (portrayed by [[Marton Csokas]]), an Elf in [[Peter Jackson]]'s adaptation of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (film)|The Fellowship of the Ring]]''.]]

In [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[legendarium]], an '''Elf''' is an individual member of one of the races that inhabit the lands of [[Arda]]. They appear in ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', but their complex history is described in full only in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', edited and published after Tolkien's death. More details about them are given in the author's other writings edited and published since then, such as ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' and ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]''. ''The History of Middle-earth'' also reveals their textual and conceptual history, as Tolkien had been writing about Elves long before ''The Hobbit'' was published. 

Elves were sometimes called the ''Firstborn'' ([[Quenya|Q]]. ''Minnónar'') or the ''Elder Kindred'' (as opposed to [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]], the Secondborn) as they were "awakened" before Men by the creator of the universe, [[Eru Ilúvatar]] ([[God]]). The Elves named themselves '''''Quendi''''' ("the Speakers"), in honour of the fact that, when they were created, they were the only living beings able to speak. The [[Dúnedain]] called them ''Nimîr'' (''the Beautiful''), while their usual name in [[Sindarin]] was ''Eledhrim''.<ref name = "QuendiandEldar1">{{Me-ref|WotJ|''Quendi and Eldar''}}</ref>

==History==
===Awakening===
{{main|Awakening of the Elves}}
The Elves awoke during the [[Years of the Trees]] in the [[First Age]] on the shores of Lake [[Cuiviénen]] under the starlit sky, as [[Middle-earth]] lay in darkness by then. There they were discovered by the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Vala]] [[Oromë]], who brought the tidings of their awakening to [[Valinor]]. 

''The Silmarillion'' states that [[Melkor]], the Dark Lord, had already captured some wandering Elves, and twisted and mutilated them until they became the [[Orc (Middle-earth)|orcs]]. However, Tolkien ultimately became uncomfortable with this Elvish origin, and devised different theories about the [[Orc (Middle-earth)#The origin of Orcs|origin of Orcs]].<ref name = "morgoth's ring1">{{me-ref|mr|"Myths Transformed"}}</ref>

The Valar made war upon Melkor, captured him, and imprisoned him in the [[Halls of Mandos]] in Valinor.

===Sundering===
{{main|Sundering of the Elves}}
The Valar decided to summon the Elves to Valinor rather than leaving them dwelling in place where they were first awaken, near the Cuivienen lake in the estern extremity of Middle-earth. They sent Oromë, who took [[Ingwë]], [[Finwë]] and [[Elwë]] as ambassadors to Valinor.

Returning to Middle-earth, Ingwë, Finwë and Elwë convinced a great host to take the journey to Valinor. Not all Elves accepted the summons though, and those who did not became known as the '''[[Avari]]''', ''The Unwilling''.

The others were called '''Eldar''', ''the People of the Stars'' by Oromë, and they took Ingwë, Finwë and Elwë as their leaders, and became respectively the [[Vanyar]], [[Noldor]] and [[Teleri]]. On their journey, some of the Teleri feared the [[Misty Mountains]] and dared not cross them. They turned back and stayed in the vales of the [[Anduin]], and became the [[Nandor]]; these were led by Lenwë.

Oromë led the others over the Misty Mountains and [[Ered Lindon]] into [[Beleriand]]. There Elwë became lost, and the Teleri stayed behind looking for him. The Vanyar and the Noldor moved onto a floating island that was moved by [[Ulmo]] to Valinor. 

After years, Ulmo returned to Beleriand to seek out the remaining Teleri. As Elwë had not yet been found, a great part of the Teleri took his brother [[Olwë]] as their leader and were ferried to Valinor. Some Teleri stayed behind though, still looking for Elwë, and others stayed on the shores, being called by [[Ossë]]. They took [[Círdan]] as their leader and became the '''[[Falathrim]]'''. All Teleri who stayed in Beleriand later became known as the '''[[Sindar]]'''.
[[Image:Sundering of the Elves.png|center|thumb|768px|The Sundering of the Elves as perceived after the Exile of the Noldor]]

===Exile===
{{main|Exiles (Middle-earth)}}
In Valinor, Fëanor, son of Finwë, and the greatest of the Noldor, created the [[Silmaril]]s in which he stored a part of the light of the [[Two Trees]] that were lighting Valinor. After three ages in the Halls of Mandos, Melkor was released. He spread his evil, and eventually killed Finwë and stole the Silmarils. Fëanor then named him ''Morgoth'' ([[Quenya|Q]]. ''The Black Enemy''). Fëanor and his seven [[sons of Fëanor|sons]] then [[Oath of Fëanor|swore]] to take the Silmarils back, and led a large army of the Noldor to Beleriand.

===Wars of Beleriand===
{{main|War of Beleriand}}
In Beleriand, Elwë was eventually found, and married [[Melian (Middle-earth)|Melian]] the [[Maia (Middle-earth)|Maia]]. He became the overlord of Beleriand. After the [[First Battle of Beleriand]], during the first rising of the Moon, the Noldor arrived in Beleriand. They laid a [[Siege of Angband|siege]] around [[Angband (Middle-earth)|Angband]] (Morgoth's fortress), but were eventually defeated.

Then [[Eärendil the Mariner]], a [[half-elven|half-elf]] from the [[House of Finwë]], sailed to Valinor to ask the Valar for help. Then the Ban of the Noldor was lifted, and the Valar started the [[War of Wrath]], in which Morgoth was finally overcome.

===Second and Third Age===
After the War of Wrath, the Valar tried to summon the Elves back to Valinor. Many complied, but some stayed. During the [[Second Age]] they founded the Realms of [[Lindon]], [[Eregion]] and [[Mirkwood]]. [[Sauron]], Morgoth’s former servant made war upon them, but with the aid of the [[Númenóreans]] they defeated him.

During the Second and [[Third Age]] they held some protected realms with the aid of the [[Rings of Power]], but after the [[War of the Ring]] they waned further, and most Elves left Middle-earth for Valinor. Tolkien's published writings give somewhat contradictory hints as to what happened to the Elves of Middle-earth after the [[One Ring]] was destroyed at the end of the [[Third Age]].  

It seems clear from Tolkien's published works that with the destruction of the One Ring, the power of the [[Three Rings]] of the Elves would also end and the Age of Men would begin.  Elves that remained in Middle-earth were doomed to a slow decline until, in the words of [[Galadriel]], they faded and became a "rustic folk of dell and cave," and were greatly diminished from their ancient power and nobility.  Tolkien does not explicitly state how long this "dwindling" process would take, but implies that while the power of the remaining [[Noldor]] would be immediately lessened, the "fading" of all Elvenkind was a phenomenon that would play out over hundreds and even thousands of years;  until, in fact, our own times, when occasional glimpses of rustic Elves would fuel our folktales and fantasies.

What presumably happened to the Elves of Middle-earth in the years and decades immediately following the [[War of the Ring]] is less clear, however.

There are many references in ''The Lord of the Rings'' to the continued existence of Elves in Middle-earth during the early years of the [[Fourth Age]].  [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]], the sons of Elrond, do not accompany their father when the White Ship bearing the [[Ring-bearer]] and the chief Noldorin leaders sails from the [[Grey Havens]] to [[Valinor]];  they are said to have remained in [[Lindon]] for a time.  [[Celeborn]] is also absent from the farewell scene at the Havens, and his words to [[Aragorn]] at their parting heavily imply that he does not expect to join Galadriel in Valinor at any point in the near future.  Celeborn is said (in Appendix A) to have added most of southern [[Mirkwood]] to the realm of [[Lórien]] at the end of the Third Age, but elsewhere Tolkien wrote that Celeborn dwelled for a while in Lindon before at last leaving Middle-earth for Valinor.

Tolkien also wrote that Elves moved to Ithilien during King [[Elessar]]'s reign, and assisted in the rebuilding of Gondor. They primarily resided in southern Ithilien, along the shores of the Anduin. It is also implied that Elves continued to dwell at the Grey Havens, at least for a certain period.  Tolkien states that [[Círdan]] did not sail with [[Elrond]], Galadriel, and the others at the end of ''The Lord of the Rings'', and [[Sam Gamgee]] sailed from the Havens decades afterward, so it would seem that at least some Elves remained in [[Mithlond]] at that time.  Círdan would supposedly leave on the last ship ever to leave the havens.  [[Legolas]] also sailed to Valinor after Elessar's death, and although the reference to this in ''The Lord of the Rings'' states that it was Legolas himself that built the ship, it seems unlikely that any Wood-Elf from Mirkwood could have done so without the assistance of Círdan's folk, whom Tolkien elsewhere said were the only Elves remaining at the end of the Third Age with the skill to build the great ships that sailed from Middle-earth to the Blessed Realm.

Finally, the many descriptions of Lórien and the Woodland Realm in Mirkwood suggest that a significant population of Elves remained in Middle-earth for some time during the Fourth Age.  In ''The Lord of the Rings'', [[Caras Galadhon]] is called a "great city," and the impression is that the population of Silvan Elves that constituted the majority of Lórien's people numbered at least in the thousands.  Descriptions of Thranduil's Woodland Realm in northern Mirkwood suggest an even larger population.  Without the burning compulsion to return to Valinor that most of the Noldor and Sindar feel, it perhaps seems unlikely that the thousands of Silvan Elves remaining east of the [[Misty Mountains]] would suddenly choose to abandon Middle-earth at precisely the moment when all of Mirkwood was again open to them and the Shadow of [[Sauron]] was gone forever.

On the other hand, Tolkien made many references to a sharply depopulated Elven world in Middle-earth that are difficult to reconcile with the above.  Especially in "The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen" that is found in Appendix A, Tolkien depicts a Middle-earth where most Elves have already left. The majority of those who remained lived in Mirkwood, while a much smaller population was in [[Lindon]]. Aragorn speaks of the empty garden of Elrond in Rivendell, and [[Arwen]] tells him that whether she would repent of her choice or not.  Most strikingly, after Elessar's voluntary death, she flees to a Lórien that is depicted as wholly abandoned, and gives up her own spirit in its sad and silent confines.  Apparently, the entire remnant of its population now resided in East Lórien (southern Mirkwood). However, it is also possible that Arwen meant that the option to board a ship and go into the West was closed to her, even if there were still Elves at the Havens, because she had chosen a mortal life.

As with so many elements of Tolkien's famous creation, these contradictions must remain just that:  examples of the various ideas and themes that the author explored at different times, and fodder for discussion among his legions of fans.

It is assumed those of the Quendi who never travelled to Aman, such as the [[Avari]], succumbed to the change and mortality of the Middle-earth, their bodies being consumed by time, and simply faded away, not unlike the [[ring-wraith]]s, turning into purely spiritual creatures invisible to human eye.

==Life cycle==
{{Cleanup|date=June 2006}}
As told in ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'' and in Tolkien's ''[[The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien|Letters]]'', Elves had a different life cycle than Men. Most of the following information strictly refers only to the Eldar, as found in his essay '''''Laws and Customs among the Eldar''''', found in ''[[Morgoth's Ring]]''—but much could probably be applied to the Avari as well.

===Early life===
Elves are born about one year from their [[conception]]. The day of their conception is celebrated, not the actual [[birthday]] itself—since for them, life begins at conception (an idea which may have its roots in Tolkien's [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]].) Their minds develop quicker than their bodies; by their first year, they can speak, walk and even dance, and their quicker onset of mental maturity makes young Elves seem older than they really are. Physical [[puberty]] comes in around their fiftieth to one hundredth year (by age fifty they reach their adult height), and by their first hundred years of life outside the womb all Elves are fully grown.<ref name = "laws">{{me-ref|mr|"Laws and Customs among the Eldar"}}</ref>

Tolkien was unclear on how fast Elves actually grew. In ''Laws and Customs'', he states that Elves' bodies develop slower than Men from the start. By the age of twenty, they might still appear physically seven years old, whereas Men at the same age are physically mature.<ref name = "laws" /> However, he later wrote that Elves and Men develop physically at the same rate until maturity, but then Elven bodies slow down and stop aging physically, while human bodies don't.

===Sexuality, marriage, and parenthood===

Elves marry freely and for love early in life. [[Monogamy]] is practised and [[adultery]] is unthinkable; they only marry once (Finwë, first High King of the Noldor, was an exception, as he remarried after his first wife died).<ref name = "laws" /> 

Spouses can choose each other even long before they are married, thus becoming betrothed.  The betrothal is subject to parental approval unless the parties are of age and intend to marry soon, at which point the betrothal is announced at a meeting of the two houses.  They exchange rings and the betrothal lasts at least a year, and is revocable by the return of the rings; however, it is rarely broken. After their formal betrothal, the couple appoint a date, at least a year, for the wedding.<ref name = "laws" />

Marriage is celebrated at a feast of the two houses. They give back their betrothal rings and receive others worn on their index fingers. The bride’s mother gives the groom a jewel to be worn, but the marriage is achieved with its [[sexual intercourse|consummation]]. Technically, only the words exchanged by the bride and groom (including the speaking of the name of [[Eru]]) and the consummation are required for marriage,<ref name = "laws" /> as with the Catholic sacrament of matrimony.

The Elves view the sexual act as extremely special and intimate, for it leads to the conception and birth of children. [[extra-marital sex|Extra-marital]] and [[premarital sex]] are unthinkable — indeed, the Elves would regard them as contradictions in terms. Because [[adultery]] is also unheard of and fidelity between spouses is absolute, spouses can sometimes live separately for extended periods of time without fear of infidelity. Yet a sundering during pregnancy or during the early years of parenthood (caused by war, for example) is so grievous to the couple that they prefer to have children in peaceful times. In the case of [[rape]], Elves lose the will to live.<ref name = "laws" />

Elves have few children, as a rule; (Fëanor and [[Nerdanel]] were an exception, conceiving seven sons), and there are relatively sizable intervals between each child. They are soon preoccupied with other pleasures; their [[libido]] wanes and they focus their interests elsewhere, like the arts. Nonetheless, they take great delight in the union of love, and they cherish the days of bearing and raising children as the happiest days of their lives.<ref name = "laws" />

There seems to only be one known example of extreme marital strife in Tolkien's mythology, that of [[Eöl]] and [[Aredhel]], in which the latter actually left the former without his knowledge, resulting in Eöl ultimately killing her. However, this marriage was far from typical of the Elves.

===Daily life===
The Elves, particularly the Noldor, preoccupy themselves with various things, such as smithwork, sculpture, music and other arts, and of course, what to eat. Males and females can do almost everything equally; however, the females often specialize in the arts of healing while the men go to war. This is because they believe that taking life interferes with the ability to preserve life. However, Elves are not stuck in rigid roles; females can defend themselves at need as well as males, and many males are skilled healers as well, such as [[Elrond]].<ref name = "laws" />

===Later life===
Eventually, if they do not die in battle or from some other cause, the Elves of Middle-earth grow weary of it and desire to go to Valinor, where the Valar originally sheltered their kind. Those who wish to leave for the Undying Lands go by boats provided at the [[Grey Havens]], where [[Círdan]] the Shipwright dwells with his folk.

==="The third cycle of life," aging, and facial hair===
Despite Tolkien's statements in ''The Hobbit'' that Elves (and Hobbits) have no beards, Círdan in fact has a beard, which appears to be an anomaly and a simple oversight. However, Tolkien later devised at least  three "cycles of life" for Elves around 1960; Círdan had a beard because he was in his third cycle of life.  ([[Mahtan]], Nerdanel's father, had a beard in his second cycle of life, a rare phenomenon.)  It is unclear what these cycles exactly are, since Tolkien left no notes further explaining this. Apparently, beards were the only sign of further natural physical aging beyond maturity.

Nevertheless, Tolkien may have ultimately changed his mind about whether Elves had facial hair. As Christopher Tolkien states in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', his father wrote in December 1972 or later that the Elvish strain in Men, such as [[Aragorn]], was "''observable in the beardlessness of those who were so descended''", since "''it was a characteristic of all Elves to be beardless''".<ref>{{Me-ref|ut}}</ref> This would seemingly contradict the information above.

Elves sometimes appear to age under great stress. Círdan appeared to be aged himself, since he is described as looking old, save for the stars in his eyes; this may be due to all the sorrows he had seen and lived through since the First Age. Also, the people of [[Gwindor]] of [[Nargothrond]] had trouble recognizing him after his time as a prisoner of Morgoth.

===Death===
Elves are naturally immortal.  In addition to their immortality, Elves are immune to all diseases, and they can recover from wounds which would normally kill a mortal Man.  However, Elves can be slain, or die of grief and weariness.

Elves who die or are killed go to the Purgatory-like Halls of Mandos in Valinor.  After a certain period of time and rest that serves as "cleansing", their spirits (''[[Fëa and hröa|fëar]]'') are clothed in bodies (''[[Fëa and hröa|hröar]]'') identical to their old ones.<ref name = "converse">{{ME-ref|MR|''The Converse of Manwë and Eru'', p. 361-4}}</ref> They almost never go back to Middle-earth, however. The only Elf known to have done so was [[Glorfindel]]. A rare and more unique example of an Elf coming back from the Halls of Mandos can be read in the tale of Beren and Lúthien, as [[Lúthien]] was the other Elf to be sent back to Middle-earth - as a mortal, however.

Eventually, their immortal spirits (''fëar'') will overwhelm and consume their bodies (''hröar''), rendering them "bodiless", whether they opt to go to Valinor or remain in Middle-earth. At the end of the world, all Elves will have become invisible to mortal eyes, except to those to whom they wish to manifest themselves.<ref name = "laws" /> Tolkien called the Elves of Middle-earth who had undergone this process "Lingerers", and the process may be thought of as a fourth and final cycle of Elven life.

Theoretically, if the Elves did exist, at the end of the world the youngest of them would still be visible, since for them all to become invisible would logically require that all Elves stop reproducing at some point. Incidentally, this voluntary cessation of reproduction appeared in material related to the Jackson films. In the material (not explicitly stated in the films themselves), Arwen is supposed to be the lastborn of her people, thus her being called "the Evenstar" ([[evening star]]).{{ME-fact}} However, this does not appear in the books. 

The lives of Elves technically only endure as the world endures; however, it is said that at the end of time the Elves will join the other [[Children of Ilúvatar]] in singing before His throne.

==Naming conventions==

An Elf of Valinor was typically given one name (''essë'') at birth by the father (therefore called the father-name). It usually reflected either the name of the father or mother, indicating the person's descent, to which later some distinguishing prefix could be added. As the Elf grew older, he received a second name, given by the mother (''amilessë''). This name was extremely important and reflected personality, skills, or fate, sometimes being 'prophetic'. 

The ''epessë'' or the "after-name" is the third type. It was given later in life, not necessarily by kin, as a title of admiration and honour. In some circumstances, yet another name was chosen by the Elf himself or herself, called therefore ''kilmessë'' "self-name".

The "true names" remained the first two, though an Elf could be referred to by any of these. Mother-names were usually not used by those who did not know the Elf well; it would be considered rude to do so. In later history and song any of the four could become the one generally used and recognised.

After their Exile to Middle-earth and adoption of [[Sindarin]] as the daily speech, most of the Noldor also choosed themselves a name that fitted the style of that language, translating or altering one of their [[Quenya]] names.

Another type was the [[patronymic]] — the father's name with the suffix "-ion" added. Thus, [[Gildor Inglorion]] is "''Gildor, son of Inglor''".

Several examples include:

*'''[[Galadriel]]''' is the Sindarin translation of Alatáriel, the Telerin Quenya ''epessë'' originally given to her by [[Celeborn]], which means "Maiden Crowned by a Radiant Garland". Her father-name is Artanis (noble woman) and her mother-name is Nerwen (man-maiden).

*'''[[Maedhros]]''', the oldest son of [[Fëanor]], was called ''Russandol'' (copper-top) by his brothers: He had earned this ''epessë'' because of his ruddy hair. His father-name had been ''Nelyafinwë'' (Finwë the third: Fëanor's own father-name had been (Curu) finwë), and his mother-name ''Maitimo'' (well-shaped one). ''Maedhros'' is a rendering into Sindarin of parts of his mother-name and ''epessë''.

*'''[[Finrod Felagund|Finrod]]''' is usually referred to as ''Felagund'' (hewer of caves), a name the [[Dwarves]] had given to him (originally ''Felakgundu'') because of his dwellings at [[Nargothrond]]. Finrod adopted the name, and made it a title of honour.

*'''[[Círdan]]''' (Shipwright) is the ''epessë'' of a [[Teleri]]n Elf who remained in [[Beleriand]], and later [[Lindon]], until the end of the [[Third Age]]. His original name was only rarely remembered in traditions as ''Nōwē'', and he was referred to always as Círdan, a title which had been given to him as Lord of the [[Falas]].

== Common misconceptions ==
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image: Mirkwood_archer_3.jpg|thumb|150px|Not all elves were archers who lived in forests. Wood-elf concept art from ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]''.]] -->
It should be noted that Tolkien's Elves differ  greatly in some respects from ''[[elf]]s'' of older folklore, as well as most modern fantasy elves. Aside from their different bodies and life cycle, his Elves were very much human (though the Elves of Norse mythology are often portrayed as very human like the [[Vanir]] and [[Aesir]] Gods), if "[[Fall of Man|Unfallen]]".

===Forests and archery===
The trip to [[Lórien]] furthers the perception that most Elves live in trees and carry bows, while we learn from Tolkien's other writings that his Elves were just as likely to live in caves ([[Menegroth]], [[Nargothrond]], and the halls of [[Thranduil]] in [[Mirkwood]]) and mountain fortresses ([[Gondolin]]), and the [[Noldor]] are known for their mighty swords, the [[Vanyar]] for their [[spears]], and the [[Sindar]] were known to use axes (sometimes thought to be restricted to Dwarves). However, Elves ''were'' closer to nature than Men were, though not in the same way as popularized in other fantasy worlds such as that of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''.<!--how?-->

=== Pointed ears ===
In addition, there are no explicit references to pointed ears in ''The Lord of the Rings'' or ''[[The Silmarillion]]''. We know that Tolkien's Elves did, in fact, have pointed ears only because of a letter Tolkien sent to illustrators for ''The Hobbit'', which stated that [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]]'s ears should be shown as "only slightly pointed and 'elvish'", and a passage in the Etymologies (published in ''[[The Lost Road and Other Writings]]'', corrected in ''[[Vinyar Tengwar]]'' issue 45), where Tolkien states that "the Quendian (Elvish) ears were more pointed and leaf-shaped than Human." However, practical considerations, including a number of occasions where [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]] are mistaken for Elves (most notably [[Túrin Turambar]]), suggest that the points  must have been subtle, quite different from the large ears of ''[[Elfquest]]'' or the extremely long, narrow elf-ears in some [[anime]] such as ''[[Record of Lodoss War]]'' or from the ''[[Warcraft]]'' games.

===Hair colours===
[[Image:BakshiGaladriel.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Screenshot of [[Galadriel]], portrayed with golden hair in the [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|1978 animated film]].]]
Despite what some illustrations and adaptations might imply, Elven hair colour is actually quite varied and more complex than many people realize. In general, most Elves (including [[Noldor]], [[Sindar]], [[Elrond]], [[Arwen]] and [[Avari]]) had dark or even black hair, although the [[Vanyar]] were blond and some of the Teleri had silver hair. [[Lúthien Tinúviel]] and her remote descendant [[Arwen Undómiel]], both described as the fairest of all Elves, were dark haired.

This is not the full picture, however: [[Finarfin]], the youngest son of [[Finwë]], and his descendants (such as [[Finrod Felagund]]) had blond hair on account of Finwë's second wife, [[Indis]] of the Vanyar. [[Idril]], the daughter of [[Turgon]], had golden hair inherited from her mother, [[Elenwë]] of the Vanyar. Even the sons of [[Fëanor]], the eldest Noldorin prince, were not all dark-haired: [[Maedhros]] and the twins [[Amrod]] and [[Amras]] had auburn hair, from their grandfather [[Mahtan]].

Additionally, a silver hair colour existed in the royal houses of the Sindar, with [[Thingol]], [[Círdan]], and [[Celeborn]] all described as having silver hair. As revealed in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', [[Galadriel]] displayed an extremely rare hair colour nowhere else observed: "silver-golden" hair, said to be dazzlingly beautiful ("blending the light of the [[Two Trees]], [[Telperion]] and [[Laurelin]]"), which may have been a result of her unusual mixed Noldor-Vanyar-Teleri heritage (her mother was the niece of [[Thingol]]). Thranduil, father of Legolas and a Sindarin elf, is described as having blond hair in ''The Hobbit''. Legolas' own hair colour is actually a bone of [[Legolas#Hair colour|contention]]. The blond Glorfindel was a Noldorin elf of Gondolin.

===Eye colours===
When Tolkien describes Elven eyes, they tend to be grey. The idea for the grey eyes might have come from Tolkien's wife, [[Edith Bratt|Edith]], who had grey eyes herself.  This is certainly true of Lúthien (and her descendants: [[Elrond]], Arwen and her brothers, and [[Aragorn]] and the Númenóreans/Dúnedain). [[Voronwë]], who guided the man [[Tuor]] to Gondolin, also had grey eyes. Perhaps the grey-eyed convention comes from the fact that in Medieval English literature, grey eyes were a sign of nobility.

Tolkien apparently describes all Elves in Appendix F of ''The Return of the King'' with the statement "''They were tall, fair of skin and grey-eyed, though their locks were dark, save in the golden house of [[Finarfin]]''"; however, this statement was meant to apply only to the Noldor.

Though he was half-Noldorin, [[Maeglin]] is said to have dark eyes (possibly from his father [[Eöl]], who was not of the Noldor), while [[Olwë]] (the brother of Lúthien's father [[Thingol]], and a Telerin king) has blue eyes. The eye colour of most other elves is not mentioned, so it would be difficult to generalize.

Eärendil, the half-elven son of Idril and Tuor, was said to have blue eyes when he was born — as found in ''The Fall of Gondolin'' in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''. Tolkien could have changed his mind later, but in reality it is common for babies to be born with blue eyes, regardless of their final eye colour, so this statement does not really shed much light on his adult appearance.

===Androgyny===   
Tolkien's Elves are sometimes perceived as [[androgynous]]; however, they were probably not meant to be so, since [[Christopher Tolkien]] recounts that his father wrote the following "wrathful" comment protesting against a "pretty" or "ladylike" depiction of Legolas:    
    
<blockquote>''"He was tall as a young tree, lithe, immensely strong, able swiftly to draw a great war-bow and shoot down a Nazgûl, endowed with the tremendous vitality of Elvish bodies, so hard and resistant to hurt that he went only in light shoes over rock or through snow, the most tireless of all the Fellowship."'' (''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'' Volume 2) </blockquote>

==Elvish languages== 
{{main|Elvish languages}}

Tolkien created many languages for Elves. His interest was primarily [[philology|philological]], and he said his stories grew out of his languages. Indeed, the languages were the first thing Tolkien ever created for his mythos, starting with what he originally called "Qenya", the first primitive form of Elvish. This was later called [[Quenya]] (High-elven) and, along with [[Sindarin]] (Grey-elven), is one of the two most complete of Tolkien's languages. In addition to these two he also created several other (partially derived) languages.

In Tolkien's mythology, these languages originated as follows:

*'''[[Primitive Quendian]]''' (language of the Elves in [[Cuiviénen]])
**'''[[Avari]]n'''
***'''Various Avarin languages''' (some later merged with Nandorin)
**'''[[Common Eldarin]]''' (the early language of all the [[Eldar]])
***'''[[Quenya]]''' (the language of the [[Noldor]] and the [[Vanyar]])
****'''Vanyarin Quenya (also ''Quendya'') ''' (daily tongue of the Vanyar: closest to archaic Quenya)
****'''Noldorin Quenya (later also ''Exilic Quenya'') ''' (the "Elven Latin" of Middle-earth)
***'''[[Common Telerin]]''' (the early language of all the [[Lindar]])
****'''Telerin''' (the language of the [[Teleri]] who reached the [[Undying Lands]], sometimes considered a dialect of Quenya)
****'''Nandorin''' (languages of the [[Nandor]] — some were influenced by Avarin)
*****'''Original language of [[Mirkwood|Greenwood the Great]]'''
*****'''Original language of [[Lórien|Lórinand]]'''
****'''[[Sindarin]]''' (language of the [[Sindar]])
*****'''[[Doriathrin]]''' (dialect of [[Doriath]])
*****'''[[Falathrin]]''' (dialect of the [[Falas]] and [[Nargothrond]], from which the Sindarin of the [[Third Age]] was mostly derived)
*****'''[[North Sindarin]]''' (dialects of [[Dorthonion]] and [[Hithlum]])
