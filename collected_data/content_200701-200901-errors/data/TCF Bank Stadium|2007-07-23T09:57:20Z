'''TCF Bank Stadium''' is the future [[American football|football]] [[stadium]] for the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|University of Minnesota]] [[college football]] team in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]. Plans call for a 50,000 seat on-[[campus]] "[[horseshoe]]" style stadium to be built in time for the 2009 football season. The stadium will be [[Building design|designed]] to support future expansion to seat up to 80,000 people. 

The estimated cost of the project originated at [[United States dollar|$]]248.7 million, but has since risen to $288.5&nbsp;million. The state of [[Minnesota]] will be paying approximately 52% of the cost, while the [[University of Minnesota|university]] will fund the remaining amount.  Of the university's share, $35&nbsp;million will be provided from [[naming rights]] by [[TCF Bank]], $10&nbsp;million will be generated by the sale of 2840&nbsp;acres (11.5&nbsp;km²) of university land back to the state, and the remaining will be raised through a combination of private donations and a $25 per year [[Student Activity Fee|student fee]].

== Funding ==

The push for a new on-campus stadium for the Golden Gopher football team began in the fall of 2003. The university cited poor revenue and lack of a college football atmosphere at the off-campus [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] as their main reasons for wanting to move back.<ref>{{cite web  | last = Hippert  | first = Rebecca  | title = STUDENT SENATE MINUTES  | publisher = University of Minnesota Student Senate  | date = [[April 19]], [[2001]]  | url = http://www1.umn.edu/usenate/ssen/010419stu.html  | accessdate = 2007-07-08 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news   | last = Pugmire  | first = Tim  | title = U of M may go it alone in stadium chase  | publisher = Minnesota Public Radio  | date = [[December 13]], [[2002]]  | url = http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200212/13_pugmiret_stadium/  | accessdate = 2007-07-08 }}</ref>  By that December, the university had unveiled drawings and a general plan to seek state money and donations. In September of 2003 a highly publicized attempt was made by [[T. Denny Sanford]] to be the lead donor for the project, but in early 2004 the plan fell through when the two parties were unable to come to an agreement on the financial terms.<ref>{{cite news   | last = Tibbetts  | first = Than  | title = Officials: Stadium plan must progress  | publisher = Minnesota Daily  | date = [[October 19]], [[2004]]  | url = http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2004/10/19/10766  | accessdate =  }}</ref>  Finally on [[March 24]], [[2005]], the university and TCF Bank announced a deal that would have the bank contribute $35&nbsp;million towards the project which would give them naming rights.<ref name=newstadium>{{cite web  | title = TCF Financial Corporation gives $35 million  | publisher = University of Minnesota  | date = [[March 24]], [[2005]]  | url = http://www1.umn.edu/umnnews/Feature_Stories/Gophers_new_TCF_Bank_Stadium.html  | accessdate = 2006-01-10 }}</ref>  The deal was given an expiration date of [[December 31]], [[2005]]; time enough for the [[Minnesota Legislature]] to provide the bulk of funding needed to make the project a reality.<ref name=dec31>{{cite web  | title = Stadium sponsorship agreement with TCF extended  | publisher = University of Minnesota  | date = [[December 28]], [[2005]]  | url = http://www1.umn.edu/umnnews/Feature_Stories/Stadium_sponsorship_agreement_with_TCF_extended.html  | accessdate = 2005-12-28 }}</ref>  

===State of Minnesota===
During the remainder of 2005 the university concentrated on drafting a stadium proposal that would draw the support of state [[politician]]s.  The final plan proposed that the state of Minnesota would contribute 40% of the stadium cost while the university would raise the remaining 60% on its own.  Portions of that 60% were to be funded by the TCF naming rights, while the remainder would come from a $50 per semester student fee, private donations, the sale of 2840&nbsp;acres (11.5&nbsp;km²) of university land in rural [[Dakota County, Minnesota|Dakota County]] back to the state, and game day parking revenue.<ref name=newstadium />  Even though the university proposal drew widespread legislative support, the stadium effort suffered a setback when the 2005 legislative session ended before the stadium [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] could be heard.<ref name ="leg">{{cite web  | title = At the Legislature  | publisher = University of Minnesota  | url = http://www1.umn.edu/stadium/legislature.html  | accessdate = 2006-12-21 }}</ref>  Late in 2005 when it became evident that this would happen, the university and TCF Bank announced that it had extended the naming rights deal to [[June 30]], [[2006]].<ref name=dec31 />

Despite the 2005 session having ended with the bill not even coming to a vote, the stadium effort did not lose momentum in the legislature and was introduced quickly in the 2006 session.  On [[April 6]], [[2006]], the [[Minnesota House of Representatives]] passed the stadium bill on a 103&ndash;30 vote.<ref>{{cite web  | title = Unofficial Recorded Roll Call Floor Vote for H.F. NO. 263   | publisher = Minnesota House of Representatives  | date = [[April 6]], [[2006]]  | url = http://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/votes/votes.asp?ls_year=84&session_number=0&year=2005&id=564  | accessdate = 2006-12-21 }}</ref>  The house bill was nearly identical to what the university was proposing and had full university support.<ref name=strib32906>{{cite news   | last = Lonetree  | first = Anthony  | title = House panel adds its support to U stadium funding plan  | publisher = Minneapolis Star Tribune  | date = [[March 29]], [[2006]]  | url = http://blog.lib.umn.edu/stadium/stadium/2006/03/  | accessdate = 2007-07-08 }}</ref>  However on [[May 9]], [[2006]], the [[Minnesota Senate]] passed a radically different version of the bill on a 34&ndash;32 vote.<ref>{{cite journal  | title = Permanent Journals of the 2006 Regular Session   | journal = Journal of the Senate   | volume = 2005 - 2006  | issue = Eighty-Fourth Legislature  | pages = 5332  | publisher = Minnesota State Senate  | date = [[May 9]], [[2006]]  | url = http://www.senate.leg.state.mn.us/journals/2005-2006/20060509103.pdf  | id = Legislative Day 103  | accessdate = 2006-12-21 }}</ref> The Senate version would have removed the TCF naming rights deal, the student fees, and the purchase of the university owned land.  The proposed funding that was removed was to be replaced with a state wide [[tax]] on [[sports memorabilia]]. It also would have required the stadium to be named Veterans Memorial Stadium (which would be similar to the previous on-campus football stadium Memorial Stadium, which was last used in 1981 and then demolished in 1992).<ref name=mpr5906>{{cite news  | last = Sheck  | first = Tom  | title = Senate passes stadium bills for Twins, Gophers, and Vikings  | publisher = Minnesota Public Radio  | date = [[May 9]], [[2006]]  | url = http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2006/05/09/gopherstadium/  | accessdate = 2007-07-08 }}</ref> Governor [[Tim Pawlenty]] stated he supported the House version.<ref>{{cite news

Even though the differences between the house and senate bills were major, the details were ironed out and approved on [[May 19]], [[2006]] in a House&ndash;Senate [[Conference committee|conference committee]].  The TCF Bank naming rights and land sale remained in the bill, as did a scaled down $25 per year student fee.  The tax on sports memorabilia as well as the Veterans Memorial Stadium name were voted out.  The committee also voted to increase the state contribution to the project to compensate for the smaller student fees.<ref name=highlights>{{cite news  | title = Stadium bill highlights  | publisher = Minneapolis Star Tribune  | date = [[May 20]], [[2006]]  | url = http://blog.lib.umn.edu/stadium/stadium/2006/05/  | accessdate = 2007-07-08 }}</ref>  The compromised bill was then approved by both the full house and senate on [[May 20]], [[2006]], and was signed by Governor Tim Pawlenty on [[May 24]], [[2006]].<ref>{{cite web  | title = Unofficial Recorded Roll Call Floor Vote for S.F.

The largest portion of the university's contributions to the stadium cost will come from TCF Bank, which is contributing $35 million in exchange for among other things, stadium naming rights.<ref>{{cite news | last = Kaszuba  | first = Mike  | title = TCF perks go beyond stadium's name at U  | publisher = Minneapolis Star Tribune  | date = [[July 6]], [[2006]]  | url = http://goallineclub.com/index.php?page=news_item&id=67  | accessdate = 2006-12-21 }}</ref>  Other corporate donations have been pledged as well, including [[Best Buy]] ($3 million),<ref>{{cite news | last = Weinmann  | first = Karlee  | title = Fundraising for stadium on track  | publisher = Minnesota Daily  | date = [[October 12]], [[2006]]  | url = http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2006/10/12/69355  | accessdate = 2006-10-12}}</ref> [[Target Corporation]] ($2 million),<ref name="dailyfee">{{cite news | last = Haugen  | first = Bryce  | title = Survey: Students split over stadium, predict fee increase  | publisher = Minnesota Daily  | date = [[March 9]], [[2007]]  | url = http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2007/03/09/71130  | accessdate = 2007-03-09 }}</ref> [[Federated Insurance]], [[General Mills]] and [[Norwest Equity Partners]].<ref name=gsvideo>{{cite web  | title = TCF Bank Stadium Groundbreaking  | publisher = University of Minnesota  | date = [[September 30]], [[2006]]  | url = http://www.gophersports.com/video39/WRJURWHQNZQTVDO.20060930204004.wmv?DB_OEM_ID=8400  | format = .wmv  | accessdate = 2007-05-21 }}</ref>  The university is also accepting donations from individuals.  Currently donations are being sought from "high-end" donors (those contributing $100,000 or more), and in 2008 the university will expand the fundraising effort to gather smaller donations.<ref>{{cite web  | title = How Can I Help?  | publisher = University of Minnesota  | url = http://www1.umn.edu/stadium/help.php  | accessdate = 2007-07-08 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news   | last = Kaszuba  | first = Mike  | title = U’s stadium dream runs into financial reality  | publisher = Minneapolis Star Tribune  | date = [[July 11]], [[2007]]  | url = http://www.startribune.com/gophers/story/1295440.html  | accessdate = 2007-07-11 }}</ref>

The remainder of the university's portion will come from a maximum $25 per year student fee, game day parking revenue, and the $10 million sale of 2840&nbsp;acres (11.5&nbsp;km²) of undeveloped university land in Dakota County back to the state.  Even though the cost of building TCF Bank Stadium originated at $248.7 million, changes in the [[construction]] planning have raised the cost to $288.5 million.<ref name=newcost>{{cite web  | title = Regents approve stadium design, new price tag  | publisher = University of Minnesota  | date = [[January 3]], [[2007]]  | url = http://www1.umn.edu/umnnews/Feature_Stories/Regents_approve_stadium_design.html  | accessdate = 2007-07-08 }}</ref>  The State of Minnesota will fund 52% of that amount and the university will contribute the remaining 48%.<ref>{{cite web  | title = TCF Bank Stadium Financing  | publisher = University of Minnesota  | url = http://www1.umn.edu/stadium/financing.html  | accessdate = 2007-07-08 }}</ref> The university has vowed that even if the stadium cost rises again, it will not seek more money from the state nor increase the student fees any further.<ref name="dailyfee" />

==Stadium logistics==
===Location===
TCF Bank Stadium will be constructed on the northeast side of the Minneapolis campus, near the site of the former [[Memorial Stadium (University of Minnesota)|Memorial Stadium]]. The new stadium's site has been the location of the Huron Boulevard Parking Complex, where the university's four largest parking lots are located.<ref>{{cite web  | title = Stadium Location  | publisher = University of Minnesota  | date = [[July 18]], [[2006]]  | url = http://www1.umn.edu/stadium/location.html#  | accessdate = 2006-12-21 }}</ref>   The address will be 2009 University Ave S.E. <ref name="logo" /> 

The stadium is part of a 75&nbsp;acre (.3&nbsp;km²) expansion of the Twin Cities campus, the largest since the [[University_of_Minnesota#West_Bank|West Bank]] was built in the 1960s. Current plans for the area call for the construction of as many as 10 new academic buildings by 2015.<ref name="stribmjs" /> The proposed [[Central Corridor]] [[light rail]] transit line is expected to run near the stadium, with a [[Train station|station]] in [[Stadium Village, Minneapolis|Stadium Village]] serving the facility. Construction of the Central Corridor is scheduled to begin in 2010 and be completed by 2014.<ref>{{cite web  | title = Central Corridor Light-Rail Transit Factsheet  | publisher = Metropolitan Council  | date = December, 2006  | url = http://metrocouncil.org/about/facts/CentralCorridorFacts.pdf  | format = PDF  | accessdate = 2006-12-21 }}</ref>

===Design===
TCF Bank Stadium will be a horseshoe-style stadium which organizers say will have a "traditional collegiate look and feel".<ref name=newcost />  The first phase of the construction will include approximately 50,200 seats, with the design able to support future expansion to 80,000 seats.  There will be 39 suites, 59 loge boxes and 300 indoor club seats.<ref>{{cite web  | title = Stadium Features  | publisher = University of Minnesota  | url = http://www1.umn.edu/stadium/features.html  | accessdate = 2007-05-21 }}</ref>  On [[December 7]], [[2006]], the university announced that the stadium's field will be laid out in an east-west configuration, with the open end of the stadium facing campus.  This layout, similar to that of Memorial Stadium, will provide a view of downtown Minneapolis.<ref name="stribmjs">{{cite news  | last = Smetanka  | first = Mary Jane  | title = Gophers' stadium costs expected to rise  | publisher = Star Tribune  | date =  [[December 7]], [[2006]] | url = http://www.startribune.com/512/story/861532.html  | accessdate = 2006-12-07 }}</ref>

===Construction===
An [[Environmental Impact Assessment|environmental impact assessment]] of the stadium site was conducted by the university between December of 2004 and March of 2006 at a cost of $1.5&nbsp;million.  The results were approved by the Board of Regents on [[March 27]], [[2006]].<ref>{{cite web  | title = Environmental Review Process  | publisher = University of Minnesota  | url = http://www1.umn.edu/stadium/environmental_review.html  | accessdate = 2007-05-21 }}</ref>  

On [[June 8]], [[2006]], the university announced that it had selected [[HOK Sport + Venue + Event|HOK Architects]] to design TCF Bank stadium.<ref>{{cite news   | last = Kazuba  | first = Mike  | title = Kansas City firm chosen to design Gophers' new stadium  | language = English  | publisher = Minneapolis Star Tribune  | date = [[June 8]], [[2006]]  | url = http://www.startribune.com/512/story/480963.html  | accessdate = 2006-06-08 }}</ref> HOK Architects was one of the three finalists, along with HNTB Architects and Crawford Architects, that made presentations to the university on [[May 24]], [[2006]]. The local firm working on the project is Minneapolis based ''Architectural Alliance'', and ''M.A. Mortenson Company'' is the [[general contractor]].<ref name="btc">{{cite web  | title = Back to Campus  | publisher = University of Minnesota  | url = http://www1.umn.edu/stadium/index.php  | accessdate = 2006-12-21 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = University selects M.A. Mortenson Company as general contractor | publisher = University of Minnesota | date = [[February 15]], [[2007]] | url = http://www.gophersports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=38605&SPID=3280&DB_OEM_ID=8400&ATCLID=798968 | accessdate = 2007-02-20}}</ref> Schematic designs of the stadium were presented to the public on [[January 3]], [[2007]].<ref>{{cite web  | title = Designs for TCF Bank Stadium Released to the Public  | publisher = Gophersports.com  | date = [[January 3]], [[2007]]  | url = http://www.gophersports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=8400&ATCLID=736453  | accessdate = 2007-05-21 }}</ref>

Infrastructure work at the stadium site began in late June, 2006, and a [[Groundbreaking|ceremonial groundbreaking]] took place at the stadium site on [[September 30]], [[2006]].  The beginning of construction on the stadium itself along with the unveiling of the stadium's [[logo]] took place on [[July 11]], [[2007]].<ref>{{cite web  | title = TCF Bank Stadium logo unveiled to signal start of Gopher football stadium construction  | publisher = University of Minnesota | url = http://www1.umn.edu/umnnews/news_details.php?release=070706_3399&page=UMNN  | accessdate = 2007-07-06 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web  | title = TCF Bank Stadium™ Construction PHASE 3  | publisher = University of Minnesota  | url = http://www1.umn.edu/stadium/phase3.html  | accessdate = 2006-12-21 }}</ref>  Site preparation and [[Foundation (architecture)|foundation]] work will continue through the summer and fall of 2007, with work on the stadium's [[steel]] skeleton beginning the following winter.  It is anticipated that the stadium's external structure will be completed in the fall of 2008, leaving just under a year to complete internal finishing, [[landscaping]], and lighting.<ref>{{cite web  | title = TCF Bank Stadium Construction Timeline | publisher = Gophersports.com  | url = http://www.gophersports.com/PhotoAlbum.dbml?SPSID=38605&SPID=3280&DB_OEM_ID=8400&PALBID=12198 | accessdate = 2007-07-11 }}</ref>

===Other potential uses===
While TCF Bank Stadium will be the game day venue of the Golden Gophers football team, the university has identified a number of other anticipated uses for the facility.  The stadium will replace [[Northrop Auditorium]] as the home of the [[University of Minnesota Marching Band]], providing the band with new storage, rehearsal, and locker facilities.  The university also expects to use the stadium for [[intramural sports]], career fairs, and graduation ceremonies.<ref>{{cite news   | last = Hopp  | first = Deborah  | title = The U's new stadium is about more than football  | publisher = St. Paul Pioneer Press  | date = [[February 28]], [[2006]]  | url = http://blog.lib.umn.edu/stadium/stadium/2006/02/  | accessdate = 2007-07-08 }}</ref>  

Several potential non-university uses for the stadium include have also been dicussed as well.  [[Minnesota State High School League]] state tournaments, concerts, and marching band and [[Drum and bugle corps (modern)|drum corps]] competitions have all been considered.<ref>{{cite book |last= University of Minnesota |title= University of Minnesota On-Campus Football Stadium - Final EIS |year= 2003}}</ref>  TCF Bank stadium has been named as a possible location to host preliminary [[Football (soccer)|soccer]] matches if [[Chicago]] wins the [[Chicago 2016 Olympic bid|bid]] to host the [[2016 Summer Olympics]],<ref>{{cite news   | last = Yue  | first = Loren  | title = Chicago 2016 turns to Minnesota for help  | publisher = Chicago Business  | date = [[January 10]], [[2007]]  | url = http://chicagobusiness.com/cgi-bin/news.pl?id=23441  | accessdate = 2007-07-08 }}</ref> and if the [[Minnesota Vikings]] successfully carry out a plan to have the [[Hubert H.
