'''Malaria''' is a [[Vector (biology)|vector]]-borne [[infectious disease]] caused by [[protozoan]] [[parasite]]s. It is widespread in [[Tropics|tropical]] and subtropical regions, including parts of the [[Americas]], [[Asia]], and [[Africa]]. Each year, there are approximately 515 million cases of malaria, killing between one and three million people, the majority of whom are young children in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Snow RW, Guerra CA, Noor AM, Myint HY, Hay SI| title = The global distribution of clinical episodes of Plasmodium falciparum malaria | journal = Nature | volume = 434 | issue = 7030 | pages = 214–7 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15759000  | doi = 10.1038/nature03342 <!--Retrieved from CrossRef by DOI bot-->}}</ref> Ninety percent of malaria-related deaths occur in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Malaria is one of the most common infectious diseases and an enormous [[public health]] problem. The disease is caused by [[protozoan]] [[parasite]]s of the [[genus]] ''[[Plasmodium]]''. Only four types of the plasmodium parasite can infect humans; the most serious forms of the disease are caused by ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'' and ''[[Plasmodium vivax]]'', but other related species (''[[Plasmodium ovale]]'', ''[[Plasmodium malariae]]'') can also affect humans. This group of human-pathogenic ''Plasmodium'' species is usually referred to as ''malaria parasites''.

Usually, people get malaria by being bitten by an infective female [[Anopheles|''Anopheles'' mosquito]]. Only Anopheles mosquitoes can transmit malaria, and they must have been infected through a previous blood meal taken on an infected person. When a mosquito bites an infected person, a small amount of blood is taken, which contains microscopic malaria parasites. About one week later, when the mosquito takes its next blood meal, these parasites mix with the mosquito's saliva and are injected into the person being bitten. The parasites multiply within [[red blood cell]]s, causing symptoms that include symptoms of [[anemia]] (light-headedness, shortness of breath, [[tachycardia]], etc.), as well as other general symptoms such as [[fever]], [[chills]], [[nausea]], [[influenza|flu-like illness]], and, in severe cases, [[coma]], and death. Malaria transmission can be reduced by preventing mosquito bites with [[mosquito net]]s and [[insect repellent]]s, or by mosquito control measures such as spraying [[insecticide]]s inside houses and draining standing water where mosquitoes lay their eggs.

Although some are under development, no [[vaccine]] is currently available for malaria; preventive drugs must be taken continuously to reduce the risk of infection. These [[Prophylaxis|prophylactic]] drug treatments are often too expensive for most people living in [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] areas. Most adults from endemic areas have a degree of long-term infection, which tends to recur, and also possess partial [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] (resistance); the resistance reduces with time, and such adults may become susceptible to severe malaria if they have spent a significant amount of time in non-endemic areas. They are strongly recommended to take full precautions if they return to an endemic area. Malaria infections are treated through the use of [[antimalarial drug]]s, such as [[quinine]] or [[artemisinin]] derivatives. However, parasites have [[evolution|evolved]] to be resistant to many of these drugs. Therefore, in some areas of the world, only a few drugs remain as effective treatments for malaria.

Scientific studies on malaria made their first significant advance in 1880, when a French army doctor working in the military hospital of [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]] in [[Algeria]] named [[Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran]] observed parasites for the first time, inside the [[red blood cell]]s of people suffering from malaria. He, therefore, proposed that malaria is caused by this [[protozoa]]n, the first time protozoa were identified as causing disease.<ref>{{cite web | title = Biography of Alphonse Laveran | publisher = The Nobel Foundation | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1907/laveran-bio.html | accessdate = 2007-06-15}} ] Nobel foundation.

However, it was Britain's [[Ronald Ross|Sir Ronald Ross]] working in the [[Presidency General Hospital]] in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] who finally proved in 1898 that malaria is transmitted by mosquitoes. He did this by showing that certain mosquito species transmit malaria to birds and isolating malaria parasites from the salivary glands of mosquitoes that had fed on infected birds.<ref>{{cite web | title = Biography of Ronald Ross | publisher = The Nobel Foundation | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1902/ross-bio.html | accessdate = 2007-06-15}}</ref> For this work Ross received the 1902 Nobel Prize in Medicine.

Gorgas]] in [[Health measures during the construction of the Panama Canal|the health measures undertaken]] during construction of the [[Panama Canal]]. This public-health work saved the lives of thousands of workers and helped develop the methods used in future public-health campaigns against this disease.

The first effective treatment for malaria came from the bark of [[Cinchona|cinchona tree]], which contains [[quinine]]. This tree grows on the slopes of the [[Andes]], mainly in [[Peru]]. A tincture made of this natural product was used by the inhabitants of [[Peru]] to control malaria, and the [[Jesuit]]s introduced this practice to Europe during the 1640s, where it was rapidly accepted.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kaufman T, Rúveda E | title = The quest for quinine: those who won the battles and those who won the war | journal = Angew Chem Int Ed Engl | volume = 44 | issue = 6 | pages = 854–85 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15669029 | doi = 10.1002/anie.200400663 <!--Retrieved from CrossRef by DOI bot-->}}</ref> However, it was not until 1820 that the active ingredient, quinine, was extracted from the bark, isolated and named by the French chemists [[Pierre Joseph Pelletier]] and [[Joseph Bienaimé Caventou]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kyle R, Shampe M |title=Discoverers of quinine |journal=JAMA |volume=229 |issue=4 | pages = e320 |year=1974 |pmid=4600403 | doi = 10.1001/jama.229.4.462 <!--Retrieved from CrossRef by DOI bot-->}}</ref>

In the early twentieth century, before [[antibiotics]], patients with [[syphilis]] were intentionally [[infected]] with malaria to create a [[fever]], following the work of [[Julius Wagner-Jauregg]].  By accurately controlling the fever with [[quinine]], the effects of both syphilis and malaria could be minimized. Although some patients died from malaria, this was preferable to the almost-certain death from syphilis.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Raju T | title = Hot brains: manipulating body heat to save the brain | doi= 10.1542/peds.2005-1934 | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 117 | issue = 2 | pages = e320–1 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16452338 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/117/2/e320}}</ref>

Although the blood stage and mosquito stages of the malaria life cycle were identified in the 19th and early 20th centuries, it was not until the 1980s that the latent liver form of the parasite was observed.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Krotoski W, Collins W, Bray R, ''et al'' | title = Demonstration of hypnozoites in sporozoite-transmitted Plasmodium vivax infection | journal = Am J Trop Med Hyg | volume = 31 | issue = 6 | pages = 1291–3 | year = 1982 | pmid = 6816080}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Meis J, Verhave J, Jap P, Sinden R, Meuwissen J | title = Malaria parasites--discovery of the early liver form | journal = Nature | volume = 302 | issue = 5907 | pages = 424–6 | year =1983 | pmid = 6339945 | doi = 10.1038/302424a0 <!--Retrieved from CrossRef by DOI bot-->}}</ref> The discovery of this latent form of the parasite finally explained why people could appear to be cured of malaria but still relapse years after the parasite had disappeared from their bloodstreams.

===Socio-economic effects===

Malaria is not just a disease commonly associated with poverty but also a cause of poverty and a major hindrance to [[economic development]]. Tropical regions are affected most, however malaria’s furthest extent reaches into some temperate zones with extreme seasonal changes.  The disease has been associated with major negative economic effects on regions where it is widespread. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was a major factor in the slow economic development of the American southern states.<ref  name="humphreys">Humphreys, M. 2001.

The lowest income group in Malawi carries the burden of having 32% of their annual income used on this disease compared with the 4% of household incomes from low-to-high groups.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} In its entirety, the economic impact of malaria has been estimated to cost Africa $12 billion USD every year.  The economic impact includes costs of health care, working days lost due to sickness, days lost in education, decreased productivity due to brain damage from cerebral malaria, and loss of investment and tourism.<ref name="greenwood2005"/>  In some countries with a heavy malaria burden, the disease may account for as much as 40% of public health expenditure, 30-50% of inpatient admissions, and up to 50% of outpatient visits. The extensive use of anti-malaria campaigns in recent decades seek to address the correlation between the disease and poverty.  Government subsidies and public healthcare providers made available in closer proximity to all of the people in a town are efficient methods to reduce the cost of treatment for the poor and the rest of the social classes as that would allow equal accessibility and utilization of treatment. <ref>{{cite web | author=Roll Back Malaria | title=Economic costs of malaria | url=http://www.rbm.who.int/cmc_upload/0/000/015/363/RBMInfosheet_10.htm|publisher=[[World Health Organization|WHO]] | accessdate=2006-09-21}}</ref>

Chronic malaria is seen in both ''P. vivax'' and ''P. ovale'', but not in ''P. falciparum''. Here, the disease can relapse months or years after exposure, due to the presence of latent parasites in the liver. Describing a case of malaria as cured by observing the disappearance of parasites from the bloodstream can, therefore, be deceptive. The longest incubation period reported for a ''P. vivax'' infection is 30 years.<ref name=Trampuz/> Approximately one in five of ''P. vivax'' malaria cases in [[temperate]] areas involve [[overwintering]] by hypnozoites (i.e., relapses begin the year after the mosquito bite).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Adak T, Sharma V, Orlov V | title = Studies on the Plasmodium vivax relapse pattern in Delhi, India | journal = Am J Trop Med Hyg | volume = 59 | issue = 1 | pages = 175–9 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9684649}}</ref>

=== Malaria parasites ===

Malaria is caused by [[protozoa]]n [[parasite]]s of the genus ''[[Plasmodium]]'' (phylum [[Apicomplexa]]).

== Mosquito vectors and the ''Plasmodium'' life cycle ==

The parasite's primary (definitive) hosts and transmission [[vector (biology)|vector]]s are female [[mosquito]]es of the ''[[Anopheles]]'' genus. Young mosquitoes first ingest the malaria parasite by feeding on an infected human carrier and the infected ''Anopheles'' mosquitoes carry ''Plasmodium'' [[sporozoite]]s in their [[salivary gland]]s. A mosquito becomes infected when it takes a blood meal from an infected human. Once ingested, the parasite [[gametocytes]] taken up in the blood will further differentiate into male or female [[gametes]] and then fuse in the mosquito gut. This produces an [[ookinete]] that penetrates the gut lining and produces an [[oocyst]] in the gut wall. When the oocyst ruptures, it releases sporozoites that migrate through the mosquito's body to the salivary glands, where they are then ready to infect a new human host.  This type of transmission is occasionally referred to as anterior station transfer.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Talman A, Domarle O, McKenzie F, Ariey F, Robert V | title = Gametocytogenesis: the puberty of Plasmodium falciparum | journal = Malar J | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 24 | year = 2004| pmid = 15253774 | doi = 10.1186/1475-2875-3-24}}</ref> The sporozoites are injected into the skin, alongside saliva, when the mosquito takes a subsequent blood meal.

Only female mosquitoes feed on blood, thus males do not transmit the disease. The females of the ''Anopheles'' genus of mosquito prefer to feed at night.  They usually start searching for a meal at dusk, and will continue throughout the night until taking a meal. Malaria parasites can also be transmitted by [[blood transfusion]]s, although this is rare.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Marcucci C, Madjdpour C, Spahn D | title = Allogeneic blood transfusions: benefit, risks and clinical indications in countries with a low or high human development index | journal = Br Med Bull | volume = 70 | issue = | pages = 15–28 | year = 2004| pmid = 15339855 | doi = 10.1093/bmb/ldh023}}</ref>

== Pathogenesis ==
[[Image:MalariacycleBig.jpg|thumb|right|400px|The life cycle of malaria parasites in the human body. A mosquito infects a person,by taking a blood meal. First, sporozoites enter the bloodstream, and migrate to the liver. They infect liver cells (hepatocytes), where they multiply into merozoites, rupture the liver cells, and escape back into the bloodstream. Then, the merozoites infect red blood cells, where they develop into ring forms, then trophozoites (a feeding stage), then schizonts (a reproduction stage), then back into merozoites. Sexual forms called gametocytes are also produced, which, if taken up by a mosquito, will infect the insect and continue the life cycle.]]

Malaria in humans develops via two phases: an exoerythrocytic and an erythrocytic phase. The exoerythrocytic phase involves infection of the hepatic system, or liver, whereas the erythrocytic phase involves infection of the erythrocytes, or red blood cells. When an infected mosquito pierces a person's skin to take a blood meal, [[sporozoite]]s in the mosquito's saliva enter the bloodstream and migrate to the [[liver]]. Within 30 minutes of being introduced into the human host, the sporozoites infect [[hepatocyte]]s, multiplying asexually and asymptomatically for a period of 6&ndash;15 days. Once in the live, these organisms differentiate to yield thousands of [[merozoite]]s, which, following rupture of their host cells, escape into the blood and infect [[red blood cell]]s, thus beginning the erythrocytic stage of the life cycle.<ref>[http://www.sma.org/pdfs/objecttypes/smj/91C48D32-BCD4-FF25-565C69314AF7EB48/1196.pdf Bledsoe, G.

}}</ref>
   
Within the red blood cells, the parasites multiply further, again asexually, periodically breaking out of their hosts to invade fresh red blood cells. Several such amplification cycles occur. Thus, classical descriptions of waves of fever arise from simultaneous waves of merozoites escaping and infecting red blood cells.

Some ''P. vivax'' and ''P. ovale'' sporozoites do not immediately develop into exoerythrocytic-phase merozoites, but instead produce hypnozoites that remain dormant for periods ranging from several months (6&ndash;12 months is typical) to as long as three years. After a period of dormancy, they reactivate and produce merozoites. Hypnozoites are responsible for long incubation and late relapses in these two species of malaria.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cogswell FB |title=The hypnozoite and relapse in primate malaria |journal=Clin. Microbiol. Rev. |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=26–35 |year=1992 |month=January |pmid=1735093 |pmc=358221 |doi= |url=http://cmr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=1735093}}</ref>

The parasite is relatively protected from attack by the body's [[immune system]] because for most of its human life cycle it resides within the liver and blood cells and is relatively invisible to immune surveillance.  However, circulating infected blood cells are destroyed in the [[spleen]]. To avoid this fate, the ''P. falciparum'' parasite displays adhesive [[protein]]s on the surface of the infected blood cells, causing the blood cells to stick to the walls of small blood vessels, thereby sequestering the parasite from passage through the general circulation and the spleen.<ref name=Chen>{{cite journal | author = Chen Q, Schlichtherle M, Wahlgren M | title = Molecular aspects of severe malaria | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=10885986 | journal = Clin Microbiol Rev | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 439–50 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10885986 | doi = 10.1128/CMR.13.3.439-450.2000 <!--Retrieved from CrossRef by DOI bot-->}}</ref>  This "stickiness"  is the main factor giving rise to [[hemorrhage|hemorrhagic]] complications of malaria. [[High endothelial venules]] (the smallest branches of the circulatory system) can be blocked by the attachment of masses of these infected red blood cells. The blockage of these vessels causes symptoms such as in placental and cerebral malaria. In cerebral malaria the sequestrated red blood cells can breach the [[blood-brain barrier|blood brain barrier]] possibly leading to coma.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Adams S, Brown H, Turner G | title = Breaking down the blood-brain barrier: signaling a path to cerebral malaria? | journal = Trends Parasitol | volume = 18 | issue = 8 | pages = 360–6 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12377286 | doi = 10.1016/S1471-4922(02)02353-X <!--Retrieved from CrossRef by DOI bot-->}}</ref>

Although the red blood cell surface adhesive proteins (called PfEMP1, for ''Plasmodium falciparum'' erythrocyte membrane protein 1) are exposed to the immune system, they do not serve as good immune targets because of their extreme diversity; there are at least 60 variations of the protein within a single parasite and perhaps limitless versions within parasite populations.<ref name=Chen/>  Like a thief changing disguises or a spy with multiple passports, the parasite switches between a broad repertoire of PfEMP1 surface proteins, thus staying one step ahead of the pursuing immune system.  

Some merozoites turn into male and female [[gametocyte]]s. If a mosquito pierces the skin of an infected person, it potentially picks up gametocytes within the blood. Fertilization and sexual recombination of the parasite occurs in the mosquito's gut, thereby defining the mosquito as the [[definitive host]] of the disease. New sporozoites develop and travel to the mosquito's salivary gland, completing the cycle. Pregnant women are especially attractive to the mosquitoes,<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lindsay S, Ansell J, Selman C, Cox V, Hamilton K, Walraven G | title = Effect of pregnancy on exposure to malaria mosquitoes | journal = Lancet | volume = 355 | issue = 9219 | pages = 1972 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10859048 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(00)02334-5 <!--Retrieved from CrossRef by DOI bot-->}}</ref> and malaria in pregnant women is an important cause of [[stillbirth]]s, infant mortality and low birth weight,<ref>{{cite journal | author = van Geertruyden J, Thomas F, Erhart A, D'Alessandro U | title = The contribution of malaria in pregnancy to perinatal mortality | url=http://www.ajtmh.org/cgi/content/full/71/2_suppl/35 | journal = Am J Trop Med Hyg | volume = 71 | issue = 2 Suppl | pages = 35–40 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15331817}}</ref> particularly in ''P. falciparum'' infection, but also in other species infection, such as ''P. vivax''.<ref name="rodriguezmorales2006">{{cite journal | author=Rodriguez-Morales AJ, Sanchez E, Vargas M, Piccolo C, Colina R, Arria M, Franco-Paredes C | title=Pregnancy outcomes associated with Plasmodium vivax malaria in northeastern Venezuela | journal=Am J Trop Med Hyg | year=2006 | volume=74 | pages=755–757  | pmid = 16687675}}</ref>

==Evolutionary pressure of malaria on human genes==
{{further|[[Evolution]], [[Natural selection]]}}
Malaria is thought to have been the greatest [[selection|selective pressure]] on the [[human genome]] in recent history.<ref name=Kwiatkowski_2005>{{cite journal | author=Kwiatkowski, DP | title=How Malaria Has Affected the Human Genome and What Human Genetics Can Teach Us about Malaria| journal=Am J Hum Genet | year=2005 | volume=77 | pages=171–92 |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=16001361 |pmid=16001361 | doi = 10.1086/432519 <!--Retrieved from CrossRef by DOI bot-->}}</ref> This is due to the high levels of [[death|mortality]] and [[morbidity]] caused by malaria, especially the ''[[Plasmodium falciparum|P. falciparum]]'' species.

===Sickle-cell disease===
[[Image:Sickle cell distribution.jpg|thumb|right|Distribution of the sickle cell trait.]]
[[Image:Malaria distribution.jpg|thumb|right|Distribution of malaria.]]
The most-studied influence of the malaria parasite upon the human genome is a hereditary blood disease, [[sickle-cell disease]].  The sickle-cell trait causes disease, but even those only partially affected by sickle-cell have substantial protection against malaria.

In sickle-cell disease, there is a mutation in the ''HBB'' gene, which encodes the beta-globin subunit of [[haemoglobin]]. The normal allele encodes a [[glutamate]] at position six of the beta-globin protein, whereas the sickle-cell allele encodes a [[valine]]. This change from a hydrophilic to a hydrophobic amino acid encourages binding between haemoglobin molecules, with polymerization of haemoglobin deforming red blood cells into a "sickle" shape. Such deformed cells are cleared rapidly from the blood, mainly in the spleen, for destruction and recycling. 

In the merozoite stage of its life cycle, the malaria parasite lives inside red blood cells, and its metabolism changes the internal chemistry of the red blood cell. Infected cells normally survive until the parasite reproduces, but, if the red cell contains a mixture of sickle and normal haemoglobin, it is likely to become deformed and be destroyed before the daughter parasites emerge.  Thus, individuals [[heterozygous]] for the mutated allele, known as sickle-cell trait, may have a low and usually-unimportant level of [[anaemia]], but also have a greatly reduced chance of serious malaria infection. This is a classic example of [[heterozygote advantage]].

Individuals [[homozygous]] for the mutation have full sickle-cell disease and in traditional societies rarely live beyond adolescence. However, in populations where malaria is [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]], the [[gene frequencies|frequency]] of sickle-cell genes is around 10%. The existence of four [[haplotype]]s of sickle-type hemoglobin suggests that this mutation has emerged [[convergent evolution|independently]] at least four times in malaria-endemic areas, further demonstrating its evolutionary advantage in such affected regions. There are also other mutations of the HBB gene that produce haemoglobin molecules capable of conferring similar resistance to malaria infection. These mutations produce haemoglobin types HbE and HbC, which are common in [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Western Africa]], respectively.

===Thalassaemias===
Another well-documented set of mutations found in the human genome associated with malaria are those involved in causing blood disorders known as [[thalassaemias]]. Studies in [[Sardinia]] and [[Papua New Guinea]] have found that the [[gene frequency]] of [[Thalassemia#Beta (β) thalassemias|β-thalassaemias]] is related to the level of malarial endemicity in a given population. A study on more than 500 children in [[Liberia]] found that those with β-thalassaemia had a 50% decreased chance of getting clinical malaria. Similar studies have found links between gene frequency and malaria endemicity in the α+ form of α-thalassaemia. Presumably these genes have also been [[natural selection|selected]] in the course of human evolution.

===Duffy antigens===
The [[Duffy antigen]]s are [[antigens]] expressed on red blood cells and other cells in the body acting as a [[chemokine]] receptor. The expression of Duffy antigens on blood cells is encoded by Fy genes (Fya, Fyb, Fyc etc.). ''[[Plasmodium vivax]]'' malaria uses the Duffy antigen to enter blood cells. However, it is possible to express no Duffy antigen on red blood cells (Fy-/Fy-). This [[genotype]] confers complete resistance to ''P. vivax'' infection. The genotype is very rare in European, Asian and American populations, but is found in almost all of the indigenous population of West and Central Africa.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Carter R, Mendis KN |title=Evolutionary and historical aspects of the burden of malaria |url=http://cmr.asm.org/cgi/content/full/15/4/564?view=long&pmid=12364370#RBC%20Duffy%20Negativity |journal=Clin.

===G6PD===
[[Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase]] (G6PD) is an [[enzyme]] that normally protects from the effects of [[oxidative stress]] in red blood cells. However, a genetic deficiency in this enzyme results in increased protection against severe malaria.

===HLA and interleukin-4===
[[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA-B53]] is associated with low risk of severe malaria. This [[Major histocompatibility complex|MHC class I]] molecule presents [[liver]] stage and [[sporozoite]] [[antigens]] to [[T-Cells]]. Interleukin-4, encoded by IL4, is produced by activated T cells and promotes proliferation and differentiation of antibody-producing B cells. A study of the Fulani of Burkina Faso, who have both fewer malaria attacks and higher levels of antimalarial antibodies than do neighboring ethnic groups, found that the IL4-524 T allele was associated with elevated antibody levels against malaria antigens, which raises the possibility that this might
be a factor in increased resistance to malaria.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Verra F, Luoni G, Calissano C, Troye-Blomberg M, Perlmann P, Perlmann H, Arcà B, Sirima B, Konaté A, Coluzzi M, Kwiatkowski D, Modiano D |title=IL4-589C/T polymorphism and IgE levels in severe malaria |journal=Acta Trop. |volume=90 |issue=2 |pages=205–9 |year=2004 |pmid=15177147 | doi = 10.1016/j.actatropica.2003.11.014 <!--Retrieved from CrossRef by DOI bot-->}}</ref>

Severe malaria is commonly misdiagnosed in [[Africa]], leading to a failure to treat other life-threatening illnesses. In malaria-endemic areas, [[parasitemia]] does not ensure a diagnosis of severe malaria because parasitemia can be incidental to other concurrent disease. Recent investigations suggest that malarial [[retinopathy]] is better (collective sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 90%) than any other clinical or laboratory feature in distinguishing malarial from non-malarial [[coma]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Beare NA, Taylor TE, Harding SP, Lewallen S, Molyneux ME |title=Malarial retinopathy: a newly established diagnostic sign in severe malaria |journal=Am.

===Symptomatic diagnosis===
Areas that cannot afford even simple laboratory diagnostic tests often use only a history of subjective fever as the indication to treat for malaria. Using Giemsa-stained blood smears from children in Malawi, one study showed that unnecessary treatment for malaria was significantly decreased when clinical predictors (rectal temperature, nailbed pallor, and splenomegaly) were used as treatment indications, rather than the current national policy of using only a history of subjective fevers (sensitivity increased from 21% to 41%).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Redd S, Kazembe P, Luby S, Nwanyanwu O, Hightower A, Ziba C, Wirima J, Chitsulo L, Franco C, Olivar M |title=Clinical algorithm for treatment of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in children |journal=Lancet |volume=347 |issue=8996 | pages = 80 | year = 2006 |pmid=8551881 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(96)90404-3 <!--Retrieved from CrossRef by DOI bot-->}}.</ref>

===Microscopic examination of blood films===
{{Details3|''[[Plasmodium falciparum|P. falciparum]], [[Plasmodium vivax|P. vivax]], [[Plasmodium ovale|P. ovale]], [[Plasmodium malariae|P. malariae]]''|individual parasites}}
The most economic, preferred, and reliable diagnosis of malaria is microscopic examination of [[blood film]]s because each of the four major parasite species has distinguishing characteristics.  Two sorts of blood film are traditionally used.  Thin films are similar to usual blood films and allow species identification because the parasite's appearance is best preserved in this preparation.  Thick films allow the microscopist to screen a larger volume of blood and are about eleven times more sensitive than the thin film, so picking up low levels of infection is easier on the thick film, but the appearance of the parasite is much more distorted and therefore distinguishing between the different species can be much more difficult.  With the pros and cons of both thick and thin smears taken into consideration, it is imperative to utilize both smears while attempting to make a definitive diagnosis.<ref name="warhurst1996">{{cite journal | author=Warhurst DC, Williams JE | title=Laboratory diagnosis of malaria | journal=J Clin Pathol | year=1996 | volume=49 | pages=533–38 |pmid=8813948 | doi = 10.1136/jcp.49.7.533 <!--Retrieved from CrossRef by DOI bot-->}}</ref>

From the thick film, an experienced microscopist can detect parasite levels (or [[parasitemia]]) down to as low as 0.0000001% of red blood cells. Diagnosis of species can be difficult because the early trophozoites ("ring form") of all four species look identical and it is never possible to diagnose species on the basis of a single ring form; species identification is always based on several trophozoites.

===Field tests===
In areas where microscopy is not available, or where laboratory staff are not experienced at malaria diagnosis, there are [[Malaria antigen detection tests|antigen detection tests]] that require only a drop of blood.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Pattanasin S, Proux S, Chompasuk D, Luwiradaj K, Jacquier P, Looareesuwan S, Nosten F | title=Evaluation of a new Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase assay (OptiMAL-IT) for the detection of malaria | journal=Transact Royal Soc Trop Med | year=2003 | volume=97 | pages=672–4  | pmid=16117960 | doi=10.1016/S0035-9203(03)80100-1}}</ref>  Immunochromatographic tests (also called: Malaria Rapid Diagnostic Tests, Antigen-Capture Assay or "Dipsticks") have been developed, distributed and fieldtested. These tests use finger-stick or venous blood, the completed test takes a total of 15–20 minutes, and a laboratory is not needed.  The threshold of detection by these rapid diagnostic tests is in the range of 100 parasites/µl of blood compared to 5 by thick film microscopy. The first rapid diagnostic tests were using P. falciparum [[glutamate dehydrogenase]] as antigen.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Ling IT., Cooksley S., Bates PA., Hempelmann E., Wilson RJM. 
| title=Antibodies to the glutamate dehydrogenase of Plasmodium falciparum
| journal=Parasitology | year=1986 | volume=92, | pages=313–24  | pmid=3086819 }}</ref>  
PGluDH was soon replaced by P.falciparum [[lactate dehydrogenase]], a 33 kDa oxidoreductase [EC 1.1.1.27]. It is the last enzyme of the glycolytic pathway, essential for ATP generation and one of the most abundant enzymes expressed by P.falciparum. PLDH does not persist in the blood but clears about the same time as the parasites following successful treatment. The lack of antigen persistence after treatment makes the pLDH test useful in predicting treatment failure. In this respect, pLDH is similar to pGluDH. The OptiMAL-IT assay can distinguish between P. falciparum and P. vivax because of antigenic differences between their pLDH isoenzymes. 
OptiMAL-IT will reliably detect ''falciparum'' down to 0.01% [[parasitemia]] and non-''falciparum'' down to 0.1%.  ''Para''check-Pf will detect parasitemias down to 0.002% but will not distinguish between ''falciparum'' and non-''falciparum'' malaria.  Parasite nucleic acids are detected using [[polymerase chain reaction]]. This technique is more accurate than microscopy. However, it is expensive, and requires a specialized laboratory.  Moreover, levels of parasitemia are not necessarily correlative with the progression of disease, particularly when the parasite is able to adhere to blood vessel walls.  Therefore more sensitive, low-tech diagnosis tools need to be developed in order to detect low levels of parasitaemia in the field.  Areas that cannot afford even simple laboratory diagnostic tests often use only a history of subjective fever as the indication to treat for malaria.  Using Giemsa-stained blood smears from children in Malawi, one study showed that unnecessary treatment for malaria was significantly decreased when clinical predictors (rectal temperature, nailbed pallor, and splenomegaly) were used as treatment indications, rather than the current national policy of using only a history of subjective fevers (sensitivity increased from 21% to 41%).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Redd S, Kazembe P, Luby S, Nwanyanwu O, Hightower A, Ziba C, Wirima J, Chitsulo L, Franco C, Olivar M |title=Clinical algorithm for treatment of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in children |journal=Lancet |volume=347 |issue=8996 | pages = 80 | year = 2006 |pmid=8551881 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(96)90404-3 <!--Retrieved from CrossRef by DOI bot-->}}.</ref>

===Molecular methods===
Molecular methods are available in some clinical laboratories and rapid real-time assays (for example, [[Real-time polymerase chain reaction|QT-NASBA]] based on the polymerase chain reaction)<ref>{{cite journal | title=Detection and identification of human Plasmodium species with real-time quantitative nucleic acid sequence-based amplification | author=Mens PF, Schoone GJ, Kager PA, Schallig HDFH. | journal=Malaria Journal | year=2006 | volume=5 | issue=80 | doi=10.1186/1475-2875-5-80 | pages=80 }}</ref> are being developed with the hope of being able to deploy them in endemic areas.

===Laboratory tests===
OptiMAL-IT will reliably detect ''falciparum'' down to 0.01% [[parasitemia]] and non-''falciparum'' down to 0.1%. ''Para''check-Pf will detect parasitemias down to 0.002% but will not distinguish between ''falciparum'' and non-''falciparum'' malaria. Parasite nucleic acids are detected using [[polymerase chain reaction]]. This technique is more accurate than microscopy. However, it is expensive, and requires a specialized laboratory. Moreover, levels of parasitemia are not necessarily correlative with the progression of disease, particularly when the parasite is able to adhere to blood vessel walls. Therefore more sensitive, low-tech diagnosis tools need to be developed in order to detect low levels of parasitaemia in the field.

== Treatment ==
Active malaria infection with ''P. falciparum'' is a [[medical emergency]] requiring [[hospital]]ization. Infection with ''P. vivax'', ''P. ovale'' or ''P. malariae'' can often be treated on an outpatient basis. Treatment of malaria involves supportive measures as well as specific antimalarial drugs. When properly treated, someone with malaria can expect a complete recovery.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/faq.htm#treatment If I get malaria, will I have it for the rest of my life?] CDC publication, Accessed 14 Nov 2006</ref>

===Antimalarial drugs===

{{further|[[Antimalarial drug]]s}}
There are several families of drugs used to treat malaria. [[Chloroquine]] is very cheap and, until recently, was very effective, which made it the antimalarial drug of choice for many years in most parts of the world. However, resistance of ''Plasmodium falciparum'' to chloroquine has spread recently from Asia to Africa, making the drug ineffective against the most dangerous Plasmodium strain in many affected regions of the world.<ref>{{cite journal |author=White NJ |title=Antimalarial drug resistance |journal=J. Clin. Invest. |volume=113 |issue=8 |pages=1084–92 |year=2004 |month=April |pmid=15085184 |pmc=385418 |doi=10.1172/JCI21682 |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=15085184}}</ref> In those areas where chloroquine is still effective it remains the first choice.  Unfortunately, chloroquine-resistance is associated with reduced sensitivity to other drugs such as [[quinine]] and [[amodiaquine]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=Tinto H, Rwagacondo C, Karema C, ''et al.'' | title=In-vitro susceptibility of ''Plasmodium falciparum'' to monodesethylamodiaquine, dihydroartemsinin and quinine in an area of high chloroquine resistance in Rwanda | journal=Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg | volume=100 | issue=6 | pages=509&ndash;14 | doi=10.1016/j.trstmh.2005.09.018 | year=2006 }}</ref>

There are several other substances which are used for treatment and, partially, for prevention ([[prophylaxis]]). Many drugs may be used for both purposes; larger doses are used to treat cases of malaria. Their deployment depends mainly on the frequency of resistant parasites in the area where the drug is used. One drug {{As of|2007|alt=currently}} being investigated for possible use as an anti-malarial, especially for treatment of drug-resistant strains, is the [[beta blocker]] [[propranolol]]. Propranolol has been shown to block both ''Plasmodium'''s ability to enter red blood cell and establish an infection, as well as parasite replication. A December 2006 study by [[Northwestern University]] researchers suggested that propranolol may reduce the dosages required for existing drugs to be effective against ''P. falciparum'' by 5- to 10-fold, suggesting a role in combination therapies.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Murphy S, Harrison T, Hamm H, Lomasney J, Mohandas N, Haldar K |title=Erythrocyte G protein as a novel target for malarial chemotherapy |journal=PLoS Med |volume=3 |issue=12 |pages=e528 |year=2006 | month=December | pmid=17194200 | doi= 10.1371/journal.pmed.0030528}}</ref>

The development of drugs was facilitated when ''Plasmodium falciparum'' was successfully [[Malaria culture|cultured]].<ref name="Trager1976">{{cite journal | author= Trager W, Jensen JB.| title=Human malaria parasites in continuous culture | journal=Science| year=1976| volume=193(4254)| pages=673&ndash;5  | pmid=781840| doi=10.1126/science.781840}}</ref> This allowed in vitro testing of new drug candidates.

Extracts of the plant ''[[Artemisia annua]]'', containing the compound [[artemisinin]] or semi-synthetic derivatives (a substance unrelated to quinine), offer over 90% efficacy rates, but their supply is not meeting demand.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Senior K | title = Shortfall in front-line antimalarial drug likely in 2005 | journal = Lancet Infect Dis | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 75 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15702504}}</ref> In 2007, the [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]] contributed $13.6m to support research at the [[University of York]] to develop fast and high-yield strains of artemisia, with researchers predicting an increase in yield of up to 1000% compared to current varieties.<ref>[http://www.york.ac.uk/org/cnap/artemisiaproject York CNAP Artemisia Project] Retrieved August 30, 2008</ref> One study in Rwanda showed that children with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria demonstrated fewer clinical and parasitological failures on post-treatment day 28 when amodiaquine was combined with [[artesunate]], rather than administered alone (OR = 0.34).

Since 2001 the [[World Health Organization]] has recommended using [[artemisinin]]-based combination therapy (ACT) as first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in areas experiencing resistance to older medications. The most recent [[WHO]] [http://www.who.int/malaria/docs/TreatmentGuidelines2006.pdf treatment guidelines for malaria] recommend four different ACTs. While numerous countries, including most African nations, have adopted the change in their official malaria treatment policies, cost remains a major barrier to ACT implementation. Because ACTs cost up to twenty times as much as older medications, they remain unaffordable in many malaria-endemic countries. The molecular target of artemisinin is controversial, although recent studies suggest that [[SERCA]], a calcium pump in the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] may be associated with artemisinin resistance.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Eckstein-Ludwig U, Webb R, Van Goethem I, East J, Lee A, Kimura M, O'Neill P, Bray P, Ward S, Krishna S | title = Artemisinins target the SERCA of Plasmodium falciparum | journal = Nature | volume = 424 | issue = 6951 | pages = 957–61 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12931192 | doi = 10.1038/nature01813 <!--Retrieved from CrossRef by DOI bot-->}}</ref> Malaria parasites can develop resistance to artemisinin and resistance can be produced by mutation of SERCA.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Uhlemann A, Cameron A, Eckstein-Ludwig U, Fischbarg J, Iserovich P, Zuniga F, East M, Lee A, Brady L, Haynes R, Krishna S | title = A single amino acid residue may determine the sensitivity of SER`CAs to artemisinins | journal = Nat Struct Mol Biol | volume = 12 | issue = 7 | pages = 628–9 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15937493 | doi = 10.1038/nsmb947 <!--Retrieved from CrossRef by DOI bot-->}}</ref> However, other studies suggest the mitochondrion is the major target for artemisinin and its analogs.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Li W, Mo W, Shen D, Sun L, Wang J, Lu S, Gitschier J, Zhou B | title = Yeast model uncovers dual roles of mitochondria in action of artemisinin | journal = PLoS Genet | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = e36 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16170412 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.0010036 <!--Retrieved from CrossRef by DOI bot-->}}</ref>
  
In February 2002, the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' and other press outlets<ref name="bbcnewdrug2002">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1821686.stm Malaria drug offers new hope].

In 1996, Professor Geoff McFadden stumbled upon the work of British biologist Ian Wilson, who had discovered that the plasmodia responsible for causing malaria retained parts of chloroplasts,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/scienceshow/stories/2007/1902657.htm |title=Herbicides as a treatment for malaria|accessdate=2007-09-25 |format= |work= }}</ref> an organelle usually found in plants, complete with their own functioning genomes. This led Professor McFadden to the realisation that any number of herbicides may in fact be successful in the fight against malaria, and so he set about trialing large numbers of them, and enjoyed a 75% success rate.

Although effective anti-malarial drugs are on the market, the disease remains a threat to people living in endemic areas who have no proper and prompt access to effective drugs. Access to pharmacies and health facilities, as well as drug costs, are major obstacles. [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] estimates that the cost of treating a malaria-infected person in an endemic country was between [[United States dollar|US$]]0.25 and $2.40 per dose in 2002.<ref name="msf">Medecins Sans Frontieres, "[http://www.msf.org/content/page.cfm?articleid=44247857-6A39-4D9C-8FA7E54299FF1D4D What is the Cost and Who Will Pay?]"</ref>

==Prevention and disease control==
<!-- The list of methods seems to put the least cost-effective first. What's the reason for that? -->
[[Image:Anopheles albimanus mosquito.jpg|400px|thumb|''[[Anopheles]] albimanus'' mosquito feeding on a human arm. This mosquito is a vector of malaria and mosquito control is a very effective way of reducing the incidence of malaria.]]

Methods used to prevent the spread of disease, or to protect individuals in areas where malaria is endemic, include prophylactic drugs, mosquito eradication, and the prevention of mosquito bites.
The continued existence of malaria in an area requires a combination of high human population density, high mosquito population density, and high rates of transmission from humans to mosquitoes and from mosquitoes to humans. If any of these is lowered sufficiently, the parasite will sooner or later disappear from that area, as happened in [[North America]], [[Europe]] and much of [[Middle East]]. However, unless the parasite is eliminated from the whole world, it could become re-established if conditions revert to a combination that favors the parasite's reproduction. Many countries are seeing an increasing number of imported malaria cases due to extensive travel and migration. (See [[Anopheles]].)

There is currently no [[vaccination|vaccine]] that will prevent malaria, but this is an active field of research.

Many researchers argue that prevention of malaria may be more cost-effective than treatment of the disease in the long run, but the capital costs required are out of reach of many of the world's poorest people.  Economic adviser [[Jeffrey Sachs]] estimates that malaria can be controlled for US$3 billion in aid per year.  It has been argued that, in order to meet the [[Millennium Development Goals]], money should be redirected from [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] treatment to malaria prevention, which for the same amount of money would provide greater benefit to African economies.<ref name="hull2006">[http://www.wgbh.org:81/cgi-bin/nph-algs.cgi/000000A/http://www.wgbh.org/schedules/program-info?program_id=2682027&episode_id=2682029 Hull, Kevin. (2006) "Malaria: Fever Wars". PBS Documentary]</ref> 

The distribution of funding varies among countries. Countries with large populations do not receive the same amount of support. The 34 countries that received a per capita annual support of less than $1 included some of the poorest countries in Africa. 

Brazil, Eritrea, India, and Vietnam have, unlike many other developing nations, successfully reduced the malaria burden. Common success factors included conducive country conditions, a targeted technical approach using a package of effective tools, data-driven decision-making, active leadership at all levels of government, involvement of communities, decentralized implementation and control of finances, skilled technical and managerial capacity at national and sub-national levels, hands-on technical and programmatic support from partner agencies, and sufficient and flexible financing.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Barat L | title = Four malaria success stories: how malaria burden was successfully reduced in Brazil, Eritrea, India, and Vietnam | journal = Am J Trop Med Hyg | volume = 74 | issue = 1 | pages = 12–6 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16407339}}</ref>

===Vector control===
{{further|[[Mosquito control]]}}

Before DDT, malaria was successfully eradicated or controlled also in several tropical areas by removing or poisoning the breeding grounds of the mosquitoes or the aquatic habitats of the larva stages, for example by filling or applying oil to places with standing water. These methods have seen little application in Africa for more than half a century.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Killeen G, Fillinger U, Kiche I, Gouagna L, Knols B | title = Eradication of Anopheles gambiae from Brazil: lessons for malaria control in Africa? | journal = Lancet Infect Dis | volume = 2 | issue = 10 | pages = e192 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12383612 | doi = 10.1016/S1473-3099(02)00397-3 <!--Retrieved from CrossRef by DOI bot-->}}</ref>

Efforts to [[Eradication of infectious diseases|eradicate]] malaria by eliminating mosquitoes have been successful in some areas.  Malaria was once common in the [[United States]] and southern [[Europe]], but the draining of wetland breeding grounds and better sanitation, in conjunction with the monitoring and treatment of infected humans, eliminated it from affluent regions.  In 2002, there were 1,059 cases of malaria reported in the US, including eight deaths.  In five of those cases, the disease was contracted in the United States.  Malaria was eliminated from the northern parts of the USA in the early twentieth century, and the use of the [[pesticide]] [[DDT]] eliminated it from the South by 1951.  In the 1950s and 1960s, there was a major public health effort to eradicate malaria worldwide by selectively targeting mosquitoes in areas where malaria was rampant.<ref>{{cite news | author=Gladwell, Malcolm.|date=2001-07-02 | title=The Mosquito Killer | url=http://www.gladwell.com/2001/2001_07_02_a_ddt.htm | publisher=The New Yorker}}</ref> However, these efforts have so far failed to eradicate malaria in many parts of the developing world - the problem is most prevalent in Africa. 

[[Sterile insect technique]] is emerging as a potential mosquito control method.  Progress towards transgenic, or [[genetically modified organism|genetically modified]], insects suggest that wild mosquito populations could be made malaria-resistant. Researchers at [[Imperial College London]] created the world's first transgenic malaria mosquito,<ref>Imperial College, London, "[http://www.ic.ac.uk/templates/text_3.asp?P=1911 Scientists create first transgenic malaria mosquito]", [[2000-06-22]].</ref> with the first plasmodium-resistant species announced by a team at [[Case Western Reserve University]] in [[Ohio]] in 2002.<ref name="ito2002"> {{cite journal | author=Ito J, Ghosh A, Moreira LA, Wimmer EA, Jacobs-Lorena M | title=Transgenic anopheline mosquitoes impaired in transmission of a malaria parasite | journal=Nature | year=2002 | volume=417 | pages=387–8  | pmid=12024215 | doi = 10.1038/417452a <!--Retrieved from CrossRef by DOI bot-->}}</ref> Successful replacement of existent populations with genetically modified populations, relies upon a drive mechanism, such as [[transposable elements]] to allow for non-Mendelian inheritance of the gene of interest. However, this approach contains many difficulties and 34% of the malaria research and control community say that such an approach “will never fly” <Knols et al., 2007>. Furthermore, such an approach is at least 5 to 10 years away from introduction and the progress which has been made in developing a vaccine could influence further research in genetic modification of malaria mosquitoes negatively <Knols et al., 2007>.

On December 21, 2007, a study published in [[PLoS Pathogens]] found that the hemolytic C-type [[lectin]] CEL-III from ''[[Cucumaria echinata]]'', a [[sea cucumber]] found in the [[Bay of Bengal]], impaired the development of the malaria parasite when produced by transgenic mosquitoes.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7155398.stm  BBC NEWS, Sea cucumber 'new malaria weapon']</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Yoshida S, Shimada Y, Kondoh D, ''et al'' |title=Hemolytic C-type lectin CEL-III from sea cucumber expressed in transgenic mosquitoes impairs malaria parasite development |journal=PLoS Pathog. |volume=3 |issue=12 |pages=e192 |year=2007 |pmid=18159942 |doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.0030192 |url=http://www.plospathogens.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.ppat.0030192}}</ref> This could potentially be used one day to control malaria by using genetically modified mosquitoes refractory to the parasites, although the authors of the study recognize that there are numerous scientific and ethical problems to be overcome before such a control strategy could be implemented.

===Prophylactic drugs===
{{Main|Malaria prophylaxis}}

Several drugs, most of which are also used for treatment of malaria, can be taken preventively.  Generally, these drugs are taken daily or weekly, at a lower dose than would be used for treatment of a person who had actually contracted the disease. Use of prophylactic drugs is seldom practical for full-time residents of malaria-endemic areas, and their use is usually restricted to short-term visitors and travelers to malarial regions. This is due to the cost of purchasing the drugs, negative [[adverse effect (medicine)|side effect]]s from long-term use, and because some effective anti-malarial drugs are difficult to obtain outside of wealthy nations.

[[Quinine]] was used starting in the seventeenth century as a prophylactic against malaria.  The development of more effective alternatives such as [[quinacrine]], [[chloroquine]], and [[primaquine]] in the twentieth century reduced the reliance on quinine.  Today, quinine is still used to treat chloroquine resistant ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'', as well as severe and cerebral stages of malaria, but is not generally used for prophylaxis.  Of interesting historical note is the observation by [[Samuel Hahnemann]] in the late 18th century that over-dosing of quinine leads to a symptomatic state very similar to that of malaria itself.  This lead Hahnemann to develop the medical [[Law of Similars]], and the subsequent medical system of [[Homeopathy]].

Modern drugs used preventively include [[mefloquine]] ('''Lariam'''), [[doxycycline]] (available generically), and the combination of [[atovaquone]] and [[proguanil]] hydrochloride ('''Malarone'''). The choice of which drug to use depends on which drugs the parasites in the area are [[drug resistance|resistant]] to, as well as side-effects and other considerations. The prophylactic effect does not begin immediately upon starting taking the drugs, so people temporarily visiting malaria-endemic areas usually begin taking the drugs one to two weeks before arriving and must continue taking them for 4 weeks after leaving (with the exception of atovaquone proguanil that only needs be started 2 days prior and continued for 7 days afterwards).

===Indoor residual spraying===
Indoor residual spraying (IRS) is the practice of spraying insecticides on the interior walls of homes in malaria affected areas. After feeding, many mosquito species rest on a nearby surface while digesting the bloodmeal, so if the walls of dwellings have been coated with insecticides, the resting mosquitos will be killed before they can bite another victim, transferring the malaria parasite. 

The first and historically the most popular insecticide used for IRS is [[DDT]]. While it was initially used exclusively to combat malaria, its use quickly spread to [[agriculture]]. In time, pest-control, rather than disease-control, came to dominate DDT use, and this large-scale agricultural use led to the [[evolution]] of resistant mosquitoes in many regions.  If the use of DDT was limited agriculturally, DDT may be more effective now as a method of disease-control. The DDT resistance shown by Anopheles mosquitoes can be compared to antibiotic resistance shown by bacteria. The overuse of anti-bacterial soaps and antibiotics have led to antibiotic resistance in bacteria, similar to how overspraying of DDT on crops have led to DDT resistance in Anopheles mosquitoes.  During the 1960s, awareness of the negative consequences of its indiscriminate use increased ultimately leading to bans on agricultural applications of DDT in many countries in the 1970s. 

Though DDT has never been banned for use in malaria control and there are several other insecticides suitable for IRS, some advocates have claimed that bans are responsible for tens of millions of deaths in tropical countries where DDT had once been effective in controlling malaria.<!-- these claims seem less and less notable -->  Furthermore, most of the problems associated with DDT use stem specifically from its industrial-scale application in agriculture, rather than its use in [[public health]].<ref name="pmid17111979">{{cite journal |author=Tia E, Akogbeto M, Koffi A, ''et al'' |title=[Pyrethroid and DDT resistance of Anopheles gambiae s.s.

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) currently advises the use of 12 different insecticides in IRS operations. These include DDT and  a series of alternative insecticides (such as the pyrethroids [[permethrin]] and [[deltamethrin]]) to both combat malaria in areas where mosquitoes are DDT-resistant, and to slow the evolution of resistance.<ref>[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2006/WHO_HTM_MAL_2006.1112_eng.pdf Indoor Residual Spraying: Use of Indoor Residual Spraying for Scaling Up Global Malaria Control and Elimination.] World Health Organization, 2006.</ref> This public health use of small amounts of DDT is permitted under the [[Stockholm Convention]] on [[Persistent Organic Pollutant]]s (POPs), which prohibits the agricultural use of DDT.<ref>[http://www.who.int/malaria/docs/10thingsonDDT.pdf 10 Things You Need to Know about DDT Use under The Stockholm Convention]</ref>  However, because of its legacy, many developed countries discourage DDT use even in small quantities.<ref>[http://www.pops.int/ The Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants]</ref><ref>{{cite news | last= Rosenberg | first= Tina |title= "What the world needs now is DDT" | Publisher= New York Times |Date=  [[2007-04-11]] | url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9F0DEEDA1738F932A25757C0A9629C8B63 | accessdate= 2008-11-03}}</ref>

One problem with all forms of Indoor Residual Spraying is insecticide [[Pesticide resistance|resistance]] via evolution of mosquitos. According to a study published on Mosquito Behavior and Vector Control, mosquito breeds that are affected by IRS are endophilic species(Species which tend to rest and live indoors), and due to the irritation caused by spraying, their evolutionary descendants are trending towards becoming exophilic(Species which tend to rest and live out of doors), meaning that they are not as affected--if affected at all-- by the IRS, rendering it somewhat useless as a defense mechanism <ref>Pates, H & Curtis, C.:"Mosquito behavior and vector control", page 53-70. Annual Review on Entomology, 50, 2005.</ref>.

===Mosquito nets and bedclothes===
Mosquito nets help keep mosquitoes away from people, and thus greatly reduce the infection and transmission of malaria.  The nets are not a perfect barrier, so they are often treated with an insecticide designed to kill the mosquito before it has time to search for a way past the net.  Insecticide-treated nets (ITN) are estimated to be twice as effective as untreated nets,<ref name="hull2006">[http://www.wgbh.org:81/cgi-bin/nph-algs.cgi/000000A/http://www.wgbh.org/schedules/program-info?program_id=2682027&episode_id=2682029 Hull, Kevin. (2006) "Malaria: Fever Wars". PBS Documentary]</ref> and offer greater than 70% protection compared with no net.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bachou H, Tylleskär T, Kaddu-Mulindwa DH, Tumwine JK |title=Bacteraemia among severely malnourished children infected and uninfected with the human immunodeficiency virus-1 in Kampala, Uganda |journal=BMC Infect. Dis. |volume=6 |issue= |pages=160 |year=2006 |pmid=17090299 |pmc=1660577 |doi=10.1186/1471-2334-6-160 |url=}}</ref>.  Although ITN are proven to be very effective against malaria, less than 2% of children in urban areas in Sub-Saharan Africa are protected by ITNs.  Since the ''[[Anopheles]]'' mosquitoes feed at night, the preferred method is to hang a large "bed net" above the center of a bed such that it drapes down and covers the bed completely.  

The distribution of mosquito nets impregnated with insecticide (often [[permethrin]] or deltamethrin) has been shown to be an extremely effective method of malaria prevention, and it is also one of the most cost-effective methods of prevention.  These nets can often be obtained for around [[US dollar|US$]]2.50 - $3.50 (2-3 [[euro]]) from the [[United Nations]], the World Health Organization (WHO), and others.  ITNs have been shown to be the most cost-effective prevention method against malaria and are actively part of WHO’s Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

For maximum effectiveness, the nets should be re-impregnated with insecticide every six months.  This process poses a significant logistical problem in rural areas.  New technologies like Olyset or DawaPlus allow for production of long-lasting insecticidal mosquito nets (LLINs), which release insecticide for approximately 5 years,<ref>[http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2004-11/2004-11-23-voa30.cfm?CFID=15461499&CFTOKEN=28007413 New Mosquito Nets Could Help Fight Malaria in Africa]</ref> and cost about US$5.50.  ITNs have the advantage of protecting people sleeping under the net and simultaneously killing mosquitoes that contact the net.  This has the effect of killing the most dangerous mosquitoes.  Some protection is also provided to others, including people sleeping in the same room but not under the net.

Unfortunately, the cost of treating malaria is high relative to income, and the illness results in lost wages.  Consequently, the financial burden means that the cost of a mosquito net is often unaffordable to people in developing countries, especially for those most at risk.  Only 1 out of 20 people in Africa own a bed net.<ref name="hull2006">{{cite news | author=Hull, Kevin | title=Malaria: Fever Wars | url=http://www.wgbh.org:81/cgi-bin/nph-algs.cgi/000000A/http://www.wgbh.org/schedules/program-info?program_id=2682027&episode_id=2682029 | year=2006 | publisher=PBS Documentary}}</ref> Although shipped into Africa mainly from Europe as free development help, the nets quickly become expensive trade goods.

Vouchers subsidies are an effective way of getting protective nets to those who cannot afford them off the market.

A study among [[Afghan refugees]] in Pakistan found that treating top-sheets and chaddars (head coverings) with permethrin has similar effectiveness to using a treated net, but is much cheaper.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Rowland M, Durrani N, Hewitt S, Mohammed N, Bouma M, Carneiro I, Rozendaal J, Schapira A | title = Permethrin-treated chaddars and top-sheets: appropriate technology for protection against malaria in Afghanistan and other complex emergencies | journal = Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg | volume = 93 | issue = 5 | pages = 465–72 | year = 1999| pmid = 10696399 | doi = 10.1016/S0035-9203(99)90341-3}}</ref>

A new approach, announced in ''Science'' on June 10, 2005, uses spores of the [[fungus]] ''[[Beauveria bassiana]]'', sprayed on walls and bed nets, to kill mosquitoes.  While some mosquitoes have developed resistance to chemicals, they have not been found to develop a resistance to fungal infections.<ref name="bbcfungus">"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4074212.stm Fungus 'may help malaria fight']", ''BBC News'', [[2005-06-09]]</ref>

===Vaccination===
{{further|[[Malaria vaccine]]}}

[[Vaccination|Vaccines]] for malaria are under development, with no completely effective vaccine yet available. The first promising studies demonstrating the potential for a malaria vaccine were performed in 1967 by immunizing mice with live, radiation-[[Attenuator (genetics)|attenuated]] [[sporozoite]]s, providing protection to about 60% of the mice upon subsequent injection with normal, viable sporozoites.<ref name="Nussenzweig1967">{{cite journal |author=Nussenzweig R, Vanderberg J, Most H, Orton C |title=Protective immunity produced by the injection of x-irradiated sporozoites of plasmodium berghei |journal=Nature |volume=216 |issue=5111 |pages=160–2 |year=1967 | pmid = 6057225 | doi = 10.1038/216160a0 <!--Retrieved from CrossRef by DOI bot-->}}</ref>  Since the 1970s, there has been a considerable effort to develop similar vaccination strategies within humans.  It was determined that an individual can be protected from a ''P. falciparum'' infection if they receive over 1000 bites from infected, irradiated mosquitoes.<ref name="Hoffman2002">{{cite journal |author=Hoffman SL, Goh LM, Luke TC, ''et al'' |title=Protection of humans against malaria by immunization with radiation-attenuated Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites |journal=J. Infect. Dis. |volume=185 |issue=8 |pages=1155–64 |year=2002 |pmid=11930326| doi = 10.1086/339409 <!--Retrieved from CrossRef by DOI bot-->}}</ref>

It has been generally accepted that it is impractical to provide at-risk individuals with this vaccination strategy, but that has been recently challenged with work being done by Dr. Stephen Hoffman of [http://www.sanaria.com Sanaria], one of the key researchers who originally sequenced the genome of ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]''.  His work most recently has revolved around solving the logistical problem of isolating and preparing the parasites equivalent to 1000 irradiated mosquitoes for mass storage and inoculation of human beings. The company has recently received several multi-million dollar grants from the [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]] and the U.S. government to begin early clinical studies in 2007 and 2008.<ref name="Sanaria studies">[http://www.sanaria.com/presspublications.html Sanaria Press and Publications]</ref> The Seattle Biomedical Research Institute (SBRI), funded by the Malaria Vaccine Initiative, assures potential volunteers that "the [2009] clinical trials won't be a life-threatening experience. While many volunteers [in Seattle] will actually contract malaria, the cloned strain used in the experiments can be quickly cured, and does not cause a recurring form of the disease." "Some participants will get experimental drugs or vaccines, while others will get placebo."<ref>[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/health/2004261357_malaria05m.html?referrer=newsvine Health | You can get paid to catch malaria | Seattle Times Newspaper<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Instead, much work has been performed to try and understand the [[immune system|immunological]] processes that provide protection after immunization with irradiated sporozoites.  After the mouse vaccination study in 1967,<ref name="Nussenzweig1967"/> it was hypothesized that the injected sporozoites themselves were being recognized by the immune system, which was in turn creating [[antibody|antibodies]] against the parasite.  It was determined that the immune system was creating antibodies against the [[circumsporozoite]] protein (CSP) which coated the sporozoite.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zavala F, Cochrane A, Nardin E, Nussenzweig R, Nussenzweig V |title=Circumsporozoite proteins of malaria parasites contain a single immunodominant region with two or more identical epitopes |journal=J Exp Med |volume=157 |issue=6 |pages=1947–57 |year=1983 | doi = 10.1084/jem.157.6.1947 <!--Retrieved from CrossRef by DOI bot--> |unused_data=|i pmid = 6189951}}</ref>  Moreover, antibodies against CSP prevented the sporozoite from invading hepatocytes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hollingdale M, Nardin E, Tharavanij S, Schwartz A, Nussenzweig R |title=Inhibition of entry of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax sporozoites into cultured cells; an in vitro assay of protective antibodies |journal=J Immunol |volume=132 |issue=2 |pages=909–13 |year=1984 | pmid =  6317752}}</ref> CSP was therefore chosen as the most promising protein on which to develop a vaccine against the malaria sporozoite.  It is for these historical reasons that vaccines based on CSP are the most numerous of all malaria vaccines.

Presently, there is a huge variety of vaccine candidates on the table.  Pre-erythrocytic vaccines (vaccines that target the parasite before it reaches the blood), in particular vaccines based on CSP, make up the largest group of research for the malaria vaccine.  Other vaccine candidates include: those that seek to induce immunity to the blood stages of the infection; those that seek to avoid more severe pathologies of malaria by preventing adherence of the parasite to blood [[venules]] and [[placenta]]; and [[transmission (medicine)|transmission]]-blocking vaccines that would stop the development of the parasite in the mosquito right after the mosquito has taken a bloodmeal from an infected person.<ref name="Matuschewski2006">{{cite journal |author=Matuschewski K |title=Vaccine development against malaria |journal=Curr Opin Immunol |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=449–57 |year=2006 | pmid = 16765576 | doi = 10.1016/j.coi.2006.05.004 <!--Retrieved from CrossRef by DOI bot-->}}</ref> It is hoped that the sequencing of the ''P. falciparum'' [[genome]] will provide targets for new drugs or vaccines.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Gardner M, Hall N, Fung E, ''et al'' | title = Genome sequence of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum | journal = Nature | volume = 370 | issue = 6906 | pages = 1543 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12368864 | doi = 10.1038/nature01097 <!--Retrieved from CrossRef by DOI bot-->}}</ref>

The first vaccine developed that has undergone field trials, is the SPf66, developed by [[Manuel Elkin Patarroyo]] in 1987. It presents a combination of antigens from the sporozoite (using CS repeats) and merozoite parasites. During phase I trials a 75% efficacy rate was demonstrated and the vaccine appeared to be well tolerated by subjects and immunogenic. The phase IIb and III trials were less promising, with the efficacy falling to between 38.8% and 60.2%. A trial was carried out in Tanzania in 1993 demonstrating the efficacy to be 31% after a years follow up, however the most recent (though controversial) study in The Gambia did not show any effect. Despite the relatively long trial periods and the number of studies carried out, it is still not known how the SPf66 vaccine confers immunity; it therefore remains an unlikely solution to malaria.
The CSP was the next vaccine developed that initially appeared promising enough to undergo trials. It is also based on the circumsporoziote protein, but additionally has the recombinant (Asn-Ala-Pro15Asn-Val-Asp-Pro)2-Leu-Arg(R32LR) protein covalently bound to a purified ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' toxin (A9). However at an early stage a complete lack of protective immunity was demonstrated in those inoculated. The study group used in Kenya had an 82% incidence of parasitaemia whilst the control group only had an 89% incidence. The vaccine intended to cause an increased T-lymphocyte response in those exposed, this was also not observed. 

The efficacy of Patarroyo's vaccine has been disputed with some US scientists concluding in [[The Lancet]] (1997) that "the vaccine was not effective and should be dropped" while the Colombian accused them of "arrogance" putting down their assertions to the fact that he came from a developing country.

The RTS,S/AS02A vaccine is the candidate furthest along in vaccine trials.  It is being developed by a partnership between the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative (a grantee of the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation|Gates Foundation]]), the [[pharmaceutical company]], [[GlaxoSmithKline]], and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research<ref>{{cite journal |author=Heppner DG, Kester KE, Ockenhouse CF, ''et al'' |title=Towards an RTS,S-based, multi-stage, multi-antigen vaccine against falciparum malaria: progress at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research |journal=Vaccine |volume=23 |issue=17-18 |pages=2243–50 |year=2005 |pmid=15755604 |doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2005.01.142}}</ref>  In the vaccine, a portion of CSP has been fused to the [[immunogenicity|immunogenic]] "S [[antigen]]" of the [[hepatitis B]] virus; this [[recombinant]] protein is injected alongside the potent AS02A [[adjuvant]].<ref name="Matuschewski2006"/> In October 2004, the RTS,S/AS02A researchers announced results of a [[clinical trial|Phase IIb trial]], indicating the vaccine reduced infection risk by approximately 30% and severity of infection by over 50%.  The study looked at over 2,000 [[Mozambique|Mozambican]] children.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Alonso PL, Sacarlal J, Aponte JJ, ''et al'' |title=Efficacy of the RTS,S/AS02A vaccine against Plasmodium falciparum infection and disease in young African children: randomised controlled trial |journal=Lancet |volume=364 |issue=9443 |pages=1411–20 |year=2004 |pmid=15488216 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)17223-1}}</ref> More recent testing of the RTS,S/AS02A vaccine has focused on the safety and efficacy of administering it earlier in infancy: In October 2007, the researchers announced results of a [[clinical trial|phase I/IIb trial]] conducted on 214 Mozambican infants between the ages of 10 and 18 months in which the full three-dose course of the vaccine led to a 62% reduction of infection with no serious side-effects save some pain at the point of injection.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Aponte JJ, Aide P, Renom M, ''et al'' |title=Safety of the RTS,S/AS02D candidate malaria vaccine in infants living in a highly endemic area of Mozambique: a double blind randomised controlled phase I/IIb trial |journal=Lancet |volume=370 |issue=9598 |pages=1543–51 |year=2007 |month=November |pmid=17949807 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61542-6 |url=}}</ref> Further research will delay this vaccine from commercial release until around 2011.<ref>[http://allafrica.com/stories/200701090730.html Africa: Malaria - Vaccine Expected in 2011.] ''[http://www.accra-mail.com Accra Mail.]'' 9 January 2007.

===Other methods===
Education in recognizing the symptoms of malaria has reduced the number of cases in some areas of the developing world by as much as 20%.  Recognizing the disease in the early stages can also stop the disease from becoming a killer.  Education can also inform people to cover over areas of stagnant, still water e.g. Water Tanks which are ideal breeding grounds for the parasite and mosquito, thus cutting down the risk of the transmission between people.  This is most put in practice in urban areas where there are large centers of population in a confined space and transmission would be most likely in these areas.

The [[Malaria Control Project]] is currently using downtime computing power donated by individual volunteers around the world (see [[Volunteer computing]] and [[BOINC]]) to simulate models of the health effects and transmission dynamics in order to find the best method or combination of methods for malaria control. This modeling is extremely computer intensive due to the simulations of large human populations with a vast range of parameters related to biological and social factors that influence the spread of the disease. It is expected to take a few months using volunteered computing power compared to the 40 years it would have taken with the current resources available to the scientists who developed the program.<ref>{{cite web | title=What is Malariacontrol.net |publisher=AFRICA@home | url=http://africa-at-home.web.cern.ch/africa%2Dat%2Dhome/malariacontrol.html |accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref> 

An example of the importance of computer modeling in planning malaria eradication programs is shown in the paper by Águas and others.  They showed that eradication of malaria is crucially dependent on finding and treating the large number of people in endemic areas with asymptomatic malaria, who act as a reservoir for infection.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Águas R, White LJ, Snow RW, Gomes MG |title=Prospects for malaria eradication in sub-Saharan Africa |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=e1767 |year=2008 |pmid=18335042 |pmc=2262141 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0001767 |url=}}</ref>  The malaria parasites do not affect animal species and therefore eradication of the disease from the human population would be expected to be effective.
