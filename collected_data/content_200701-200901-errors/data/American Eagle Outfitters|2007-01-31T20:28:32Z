'''American Eagle Outfitters''' is a [[Category:Clothing_companies_of_the_United_States|American clothing]] retailer that dates back to [[1904]] but took its current form in [[1977]] and was reorganized in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]'s north suburbs.  It has recently announced a move to a new urban headquarters campus in the city's historic "Steel Valley". It is now commonly referred to by the abbreviation "American Eagle" or simply "AE" rather than its full title. American Eagle sells a full collection of [[apparel]] that includes basics such as jeans, cargo pants, and graphic Ts as well as accessories, outerwear, and footwear targeting the 15 to 25-year old demographic primarily under the American Eagle Outfitters® and AE® brand names. The brand is ranked #2 in sales to its target demographic behind [[Old Navy]], according to the [[NPD Group]].

The majority of American Eagle Outfitters stores can be found in [[shopping mall]]s. American Eagle Outfitters currently operates 827 stores in the [[United States]], the [[District of Columbia]], and [[Puerto Rico]]. In [[Canada]], there are 71 stores. The company also operates a website on which it offers the same clothing, often with additional sizes and styles not found in the physical stores.

Chairman of the Board [[Jay L. Schottenstein]] (who also has interests in [[Retail Ventures]], which owns [[Value City]] stores and [[DSW, Inc.|DSW]]) and related members of the Schottenstein, Deshe, and Diamond families own 14% of American Eagle, including shares owned beneficially through [[SEI, Inc]].

American Eagle Outfitters' designs can be described as a mix of [[preppy]], athletic and casual, commonly referred to in the industry as "retro". It offers a full collection of products ranging from basic t-shirts, polos, wovens, cargos, corduroys, denims and shoes to more trendy and vintage-inspired graphics and logo-driven tops and distressed or hand-finished denims.

American Eagle Outfitters is often compared to the clothing companies [[Abercrombie & Fitch]] and [[Hollister Co.|Hollister]], due to their semi-similar styles, marketing techniques, and targeted consumer demographic, as well as the department store private label brands [[Arizona Jean Company]] ([[JC Penney]]) and American Rag ([[Macy's]]).

American Eagle Outfitters brands much of their clothing with an embroidered landing [[eagle]], similar to Abercrombie & Fitch's standing [[moose]], [[Hollister Co.]]'s [[seagull]], and [[Aeropostale]]'s butterfly for females and bulldog for males. Additionally, American Eagle emphasizes on their date of establishment, 1977, in their marketing and design, branding the majority of their products with the date.

Unlike Abercrombie & Fitch, American Eagle Outfitters relies less on sexualized advertisements and catalogs, and is generally viewed as more "clean cut" as a brand.

==aerie by American Eagle==
[[Image:AeriebyAmericanEagle.jpg|right|thumb]]
aerie was announced in February 2006 as an intimate apparel sub-brand offering bras, panties, and dormwear targeting American Eagle's core 13 to 25 year-old demographic segment. The products are offered within existing American Eagle stores, intimates-only locations adjacent to AE stores, and select stand-alone aerie stores in key markets. The aerie logo is a [[finch]], and it was intentionally designed to bear a slight resemblance to the AE Eagle.



==Other brands==
In addition to its namesake brand, American Eagle, the company has developed and announced plans for several new brand and concept initiatives poised to drive new growth as the American Eagle brand nears saturation in current markets.

The company's second stand-alone lifestyle concept, [[Martin + Osa]], launched in the fall of 2006, targets men and women 25 to 40 years of age. 

The company has also indicated that a third lifestyle concept is in development that analysts speculate could be aimed at [[Baby Boomers]] (Born during 1946–64 period), and may offer homewares.

In 2001, the company acquired a [[Canada]]-based retail concept called [[Bluenotes]], which has approximately 100 stores averaging 3,300 square feet. The concept targeted a slightly younger demographic, ages 12-22, and was positioned as a denim-driven urban/suburban lifestyle brand. Due largely to poor performance, the Bluenotes business was sold to YM Inc. in 2004.

==AE All-Access pass==
In September of 2005, American Eagle Outfitters announced the All-Access Pass program. After enrollment, customers are given a physical “All-Access Pass”, which is about the size of a [[credit card]]. Customers receiving the pass are also given two cards for their key rings and multiple stickers for MP3 players as well as Cell phones. Customers earn points when they present the card to the cashier at the store or enter the card number while checking out at AE.com. Each type of product earns a different amount of points – for example, jeans are worth 20 points. Rewards are mailed out 4 times a year. Customers can earn coupons up to 40% off.

==Celebrity endorsements==
[[Justin Timberlake]], [[Eric West]],  [[Drew Barrymore]], [[Ashton Kutcher]] and [[Eva Longoria]] are all known to wear American Eagle Outfitters. Currently the Australian musician [[Ben Lee]] is involved with AE and has been wearing shirts proclaiming their slogan "Live Your Life" to his concerts. [[The All-American Rejects]] also did a free acoustic concert in the American Eagle store on the Third Street Promenade in July 2006 as promotion. The characters in various new episodes of [[CTV]]'s ''[[Degrassi]]'' also wear the clothing. (American Eagle used this as a way to advertise their line to the teen demographic of these shows.) For example the character of [[Jackson Stewart (character)|Jackson]] on the Disney show ''[[Hannah Montana (TV series)|Hannah Montana]]'' and people on the [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] show ''[[Unfabulous]]'' have sported various shirts showing the AE logo of the eagle. American Eagle also provided the wardrobe for a few seasons of the WB series ''[[Dawson's Creek]]''. American Eagle is also the official sponsor of [[MTV]]'s ''Spring Break'', and has outfitted numerous casts of both ''[[The Real World]]'' and ''[[Road Rules]]''. Wanda from the Canadian show ''[[Corner Gas]]'' almost always wears AE clothing and are easily identifiable on screen as such. American Eagle was also featured in an episode of NBC's ''[[The Apprentice]]''. American Eagle has also occasionally provided the wardrobe for [[Uranium (TV series)|Uranium]], a show on the satellite network [[Fuse]]. 

American Eagle began sponsoring ''[[Veronica Mars]]'' and ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'' on [[The CW Television Network]] with its "Aerie Tuesdays" campaign.  This campaign features the "Aerie Girls," a group of young girls discussing the relationships of the characters on the shows in conjunction with their own troubling romantic histories.  This stands to stark contrast to the intelligent women featured in the network's Tuesday-night programming.  Immediately following the premiere of "Aerie Tuesdays" on October 3, 2006, [[The CW Television Network]]'s forum contributers had coined the term "aerheads" to describe the "Aerie Girls" and mounted an effort to call American Eagle's customer service line and complain about the negative representations of women in the new campaign.
