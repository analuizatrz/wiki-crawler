'''Mumia Abu-Jamal''' ({{pronEng|muːmiɑː əbuː dʒəˈmɑːl}}); (born '''Wesley Cook''' on [[April 24]], [[1954]]) was convicted and sentenced to death for the 1981 murder of police officer [[Daniel Faulkner]], and is currently a prisoner at State Correctional Institution - Greene near [[Waynesburg, Pennsylvania]]. In December 2001 a judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania affirmed the conviction but quashed his original punishment and ordered resentencing. Both Abu-Jamal and the [[Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]] appealed. The case was orally argued before a three-judge panel in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, Philadelphia on [[May 17]], [[2007]], and is pending.<ref>See General Docket, ''Abu-Jamal v. Horn'', U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, Case Nos. 01-9014, 02-9001.</ref> 

His case has received international attention. Supporters and human rights campaigners variously assert that he is innocent, that he was setup, that he did not receive a [[fair trial]], and/or oppose the [[death penalty]]. Opponents assert that he is guilty, that he received the benefit of [[due process]] and was legitimately convicted of murder. Execution proponents among these assert that under Pennsylvania law his eventual judicial execution is warranted and mandated by the nature of his crime.<ref name = "amn">{{cite web | title=A Life in the Balance: The Case of Mumia Abu-Jamal | publisher=Amnesty International | date=[[February 17]] [[2000]] | url=http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/engAMR510012000 | accessdate =2007-10-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last =Taylor Jr. | first =Stuart | title=Guilty and Framed | publisher=[[The American Lawyer]] | date =December 1995 | url=http://www.courttv.com/archive/casefiles/mumia/guilty.html | accessdate=2007-10-18}}</ref><ref name="parl">{{cite web | title=European Parliament resolution 9(f) B4-1170/95 (p. 39 of original, 49 of pdf) | publisher=[[European Parliament]] | date=[[September 21]] [[1995]] | url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/calendar/calendar?APP=PDF&TYPE=PV2&FILE=19950921EN.pdf&LANGUE=EN | format=pdf | accessdate=2007-10-18}}</ref>

Prior to his arrest he was a [[Black Panther Party]] activist, cab driver, and journalist. During the period of his imprisonment he has courted controversy as an honoree of municipal, educational and civil society organizations, and as a spoken word commentator and published author of several works - most notably ''[[Live from Death Row]]''.

[[Image:Bpp logo.jpg|thumb|left|Black Panther Party logo]] In his writings Abu-Jamal describes his adolescent experience of "being kicked into the Black Panther Party" through suffering a beating at the hands of white racists and police at the same time as being charged with assault for his efforts to disrupt a [[George Wallace#Independent American Party presidential candidate|George Wallace for President]] rally in 1968.

==Arrest for murder and trial==
[[Image:Daniel faulkner.jpg|right|thumb|Daniel Faulkner]] 
In the early hours of [[December 9]], [[1981]], around 3:51 a.m., [[Philadelphia Police Department]] officer [[Daniel Faulkner]] was shot and killed during an altercation that ensued from a routine traffic stop of a vehicle driven by [[William Cook (street vendor)|William Cook]], Abu-Jamal's younger brother. During the altercation Abu-Jamal was also shot and wounded. Officers arriving at the scene found a [[.38 Special|.38 caliber]] revolver beside Abu-Jamal that records show he had purchased in 1979. The cylinder of the revolver had five spent cartridges. He was taken directly from the scene of the shooting to a hospital and was treated for his injury. He was charged with the [[first-degree murder]] of Daniel Faulkner. He initially retained the services of criminal defense attorney Anthony Jackson.<ref name="tr">{{cite web | title=Trial and Post-Conviction Relief Act (PCRA) hearing transcripts | publisher=Commonwealth of Pennsylvania | url=http://www.danielfaulkner.com/docs/MumiaTrialandPCRAAppealstranscripts.pdf | format=pdf | accessdate=2007-10-30}}</ref> 

[[Image:Philadelphia City Hall (from Art Museum).JPG|thumb|right|Philadelphia City Hall, shown in 2006]]
The case went to trial in June 1982 at [[Philadelphia City Hall|Philadelphia's City Hall]]. The judge initially acquiesced to Abu-Jamal's request to represent himself, with Jackson continuing to act as his legal advisor. During the first day of the trial, however, Abu-Jamal repeatedly and vociferously dissented from accepting the judge's rulings on points of law and procedure to the extent that he was removed from representing himself and it was ordered that Jackson resume the role of acting as his sole advocate by reason of what the judge deemed to be intentionally disruptive actions on Abu-Jamal's part.<ref>{{cite web | title=Trial transcript §1.72–§1.73 | work=Commonwealth vs. Mumia Abu-Jamal aka Wesley Cook | publisher=Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, Criminal Trial Division | date=[[June 17]], [[1982]] | url=http://www.justice4danielfaulkner.com/Days/6-17-82.html | accessdate=2007-10-30}}</ref> In all, according to his detractors, Abu-Jamal was removed from the courtroom at least 13 times for disruption during the course of the legal proceedings and trial.<ref name="df2">{{cite web | title=danielfaulkner.com summary of case facts (p. 2) | publisher=Justice for P/O Daniel Faulkner | date=1998 | url=http://www.danielfaulkner.com/docs/SummaryofCaseFacts.pdf | format=pdf | accessdate=2007-10-30}}</ref>

===Prosecution case===
At the trial the following sequence of events was presented in evidence by the prosecution:<ref name="tr"/> 
# During the traffic stop, Cook assaulted Faulkner, who in turn attempted to subdue Cook.
# Abu-Jamal emerged from a nearby parking lot, crossed the street, and shot Faulkner in the back.
# Faulkner was able to return fire, seriously wounding Abu-Jamal.
# Abu-Jamal then advanced on Faulkner, fired some additional shots at close range, one of which struck Faulkner in the face causing his death.
# Abu-Jamal was unable to flee due to his own gunshot wound, collapsed on a nearby curb, and was taken into custody by other police officers, who had been summoned by Faulkner at the time of the traffic stop.

====Eyewitnesses====
Four eyewitnesses, who testified that they were at or in sight of the scene at the time of the shooting, were produced by the prosecution:
# Robert Chobert, a disqualified/unlicensed cab driver on parole for [[arson]],<ref>{{cite web | title=Trial transcript §3.216 | work=Commonwealth vs. Mumia Abu-Jamal aka Wesley Cook | publisher=Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, Criminal Trial Division | date=[[June 19]], [[1982]] | url=http://www.justice4danielfaulkner.com/Days/6-19-82.html#chobert | accessdate=2007-10-30}}</ref> with two arrests for drunk-driving,<ref>{{cite web | title=Trial transcript §3.226 | work=Commonwealth vs. Mumia Abu-Jamal aka Wesley Cook | publisher=Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, Criminal Trial Division | date=[[June 19]], [[1982]] | url=http://www.justice4danielfaulkner.com/Days/6-19-82.html#chobert | accessdate=2007-10-30}}</ref> who in 1995 admitted to having sought the advice of the trial prosecutor as to how he could reclaim his driving privileges;<ref>{{Cite web | title=PCRA hearing transcript pp.5–6 | work=Commonwealth vs. Mumia Abu-Jamal aka Wesley Cook | publisher=Court of Common Pleas, First Judicial District of Pennsylvania, Criminal Trial Division | date=[[August 15]], [[1995]] | url=http://www.justice4danielfaukner.com/pcra/95-08-15.html#chobert | accessdate=2007-11-22}}</ref>

# Albert Magilton, a pedestrian.

Robert Chobert said he was in his cab parked directly behind Faulkner's police car. He positively identified Abu-Jamal as the shooter, testifying: "I heard a shot. I looked up, I saw the cop fall to the ground, and then I saw Jamal standing over him and firing some more shots into him...Then I saw him [Jamal] walking back about ten feet and he just fell by the curb."<ref>{{cite web | title=Trial transcript §3.210–§3.211 | work=Commonwealth vs. Mumia Abu-Jamal aka Wesley Cook | publisher=Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, Criminal Trial Division | date=[[June 19]], [[1982]] | url=http://www.justice4danielfaulkner.com/Days/6-19-82.html#chobert | accessdate=2007-10-30}}</ref> During cross-examination, he admitted that he had originally told police that the shooter had moved 30 rather than 10&nbsp;ft away from Faulkner, and had been 30-to-50&nbsp;pounds heavier than Abu-Jamal.

Cynthia White testified to witnessing the shootings from a nearby corner. Describing Abu-Jamal's actions, she said: "he was running out of the parking lot and he was practically on the curb when he shot two times at the police officer. It was the back. The police officer turned around and staggered and seemed like he was grabbing for something. Then he fell. Then he came over and he came on top of the police officer and shot some more times.

Scanlan testified that he saw Faulkner assaulted in front of his police car shortly before another man ran across the street from a parking lot and shot Faulkner. Scanlan was not able to identify the shooter. Under cross-examination, which was interrupted by Abu-Jamal being removed from the courtroom for disruption, Scanlan admitted to being mildly under the influence of alcohol and was unable to describe in detail the appearance of the assailant.<ref>{{cite web | title=Trial transcript pp.5–75 | work=Commonwealth vs. Mumia Abu-Jamal aka Wesley Cook | publisher=Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, Criminal Trial Division | date=[[June 25]], [[1982]] | url=http://www.justice4danielfaulkner.com/Days/6-25-82.html#scanlan | accessdate=2007-10-30}}</ref>

Magilton testified to witnessing Faulkner pull over Cook's car and that at the point of seeing Abu-Jamal start to cross the street toward them from the parking lot he turned away and lost sight of what happened next until he heard gun shots.

====Hospital confession====
The prosecution presented two witnesses, security officer Priscilla Durham and Police Officer Garry Bell, who testified that while Abu-Jamal was at hospital, he acknowledged that he shot Faulkner by once or even twice proclaiming, "I shot the mother fucker, and I hope the mother fucker dies."<ref>{{cite web | title=Trial transcript pp.29, 31, 34, 137, 162 and 164 | work=Commonwealth vs. Mumia Abu-Jamal aka Wesley Cook | publisher=Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, Criminal Trial Division | date=[[June 24]], [[1982]] | url=http://www.justice4danielfaulkner.com/Days/6-24-82.html | accessdate=2007-10-30}}</ref> The hospital doctors are recorded as having said that Abu-Jamal was not capable of making such a statement during the time that he was reported to have uttered it.<ref name="guardian"/> The original report of Gary Wakshul, a police officer who accompanied Abu-Jamal to and at the hospital, relates that "the negro male made no comments".<ref name="amn"/> Wakshul later claimed to recall hearing Abu-Jamal's alleged confession on the night of the killing, over two months after the arrest when interviewed by police Internal Affairs officers. He blamed "emotional trauma" for the delay.<ref name="amn"/> Judge [[Albert F. Sabo]] did not permit the trial jury to receive Wakshul's report as evidence.<ref name="amn"/>

====Physical evidence====
A .38 caliber [[Charter Arms]] revolver registered to Abu-Jamal was found at the scene next to him with 5 spent shell casings.<ref>{{cite web | title=Developments in the Mumia Abu-Jamal case | publisher=[[CNN.com]] | date=[[December 18]], [[2001]] | url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/LAW/12/18/chronology.abu.jamal | accessdate=2007-10-18}}</ref> Tests performed with the available physical evidence verify that Faulkner was killed by a .38 caliber bullet.

[[Amnesty International]], with reference to the physical evidence, has expressed the view that "…the police failed to conduct tests to ascertain whether the weapon had been fired in the immediate past…Compounding this error, the police also failed to conduct chemical tests on Abu-Jamal's hands to find out if he had fired a gun recently."<ref name="amn"/> In a 1995 hearing, a defense ballistics expert testified that due to Abu-Jamal's struggle with the police during his arrest, such a test would have been difficult to accomplish and, due to the gunpowder residue possibly being shaken or rubbed off, would not have been scientifically reliable.<ref>{{cite web | title=PCRA hearing transcript, pp.118–122 | work=Commonwealth vs. Mumia Abu-Jamal aka Wesley Cook | publisher=Court of Common Pleas, First Judicial District of Pennsylvania, Criminal Trial Division | date=[[August 2]], [[1995]] | url=http://www.justice4danielfaulkner.com/pcra/95-08-02.html | accessdate=2007-11-22}}</ref> A note written by coroner Dr. Paul Hoyer, who [[autopsy|autopsied]] Daniel Faulkner, states that he extracted a [[.44 Magnum|.44 caliber]] bullet from Faulkner.

===Defense case===
The defense presented evidence, from witness Dessie Hightower, describing a man running along the street shortly after the shooting.<ref>{{cite web | title=Trial transcript p.127 | work=Commonwealth vs. Mumia Abu-Jamal aka Wesley Cook | publisher=Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, Criminal Trial Division | date=[[June 28]], [[1982]] | url=http://www.justice4danielfaulkner.com/Days/6-28-82.html | accessdate=2007-10-30}}</ref> This became known as the "running man theory", based on the possibility that a "running man" may have been the actual shooter. Another witness, Veronica Jones, said "All I seen was two men and a policeman on the ground and what else can I say? I was kind of intoxicated." In reply to the question, "Did you see anyone running away from the scene?" She replied, "I didn't see anyone do nothing. No one moved."<ref>{{cite web | title=Trial transcript pp.99–100 | work=Commonwealth vs. Mumia Abu-Jamal aka Wesley Cook | publisher=Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, Criminal Trial Division | date=[[June 29]], [[1982]] | url=http://www.justice4danielfaulkner.com/Days/6-29-82.html#jones | accessdate=2007-10-30}}</ref> The defense claimed to have a third witness, Deborah Kordansky, but she refused to appear in court.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.justice4danielfaulkner.com/Days/5-25-83.html | title=Post-Trial Motions transcript p.29 | work=Commonwealth vs. Mumia Abu-Jamal aka Wesley Cook | publisher=Court of Common Pleas, First Judicial District of Pennsylvania, Criminal Trial Division | date=[[May 25]], [[1983]] | accessdate=2007-11-22}}</ref> Of the witnesses, only Chobert testified that shortly after the shooting he had told police that he had seen Abu-Jamal shoot Faulkner in the face, and that Abu-Jamal had then run a short distance and collapsed on the sidewalk after being shot by Faulkner.<ref name="chobert"/> None of the other witnesses claimed that the running man, or men, were involved in the shooting.<ref name="tr"/>

The defense presented nine [[Character witness#Criminal trials|character witnesses]] including poet [[Sonia Sanchez]]. Sanchez testified that Abu-Jamal was "viewed by the black community as a creative, articulate, peaceful, genial man."<ref>{{cite web | title=Trial transcript p.19 | work=Commonwealth vs. Mumia Abu-Jamal aka Wesley Cook | publisher=Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, Criminal Trial Division | date=[[June 30]], [[1982]] | url=http://www.justice4danielfaulkner.com/Days/6-30-82.html#sanchez | accessdate=2007-10-30}}</ref> During cross examination the prosecution raised the issue of her association with convicted felon and Black Panther activist [[Assata Shakur|Joanne Chesimard]]; Sanchez was also asked over defense objections whether she supported other blacks who had killed police.<ref>{{cite web | title=Trial transcript p.19–30 | work=Commonwealth vs. Mumia Abu-Jamal aka Wesley Cook | publisher=Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, Criminal Trial Division | date=[[June 30]], [[1982]] | url=http://www.justice4danielfaulkner.com/Days/6-30-82.html#sanchez | accessdate=2007-10-30}}</ref>

===Witnesses not called at trial===
Abu-Jamal did not testify in his own defense. Regarding this he has explained:<ref name="mum">{{cite web | last=Abu-Jamal | first=Mumia | title=Declaration of Mumia Abu-Jamal | publisher=Chicago Committee to Free Mumia Abu-Jamal | date=[[May 3]], [[2001]] | url=http://www.chicagofreemumia.org/mumiadecl.html | accessdate=2007-11-23}}</ref><blockquote>"At my trial I was denied the right to defend myself. I had no confidence in my court-appointed attorney, who never even asked me what happened the night I was shot and the police officer was killed; and I was excluded from at least half the trial…Since I was denied all my rights at my trial I did not testify. I would not be used to make it look like I had a fair trial."</blockquote>
He did not state his version of events for the initial police investigation, nor for almost another 20 years afterwards, until the 1999 confession of [[Arnold Beverly]], who claimed that, "wearing a green (camouflage) army jacket", he had run across the street and shot a fallen Daniel Faulkner in the face as part of a contract killing connected with a desire to keep Faulkner from interfering with graft and payoff to corrupt police.<ref>{{cite web | last=Beverly | first=Arnold | title=Affidavit of Arnold Beverly | publisher=Free Mumia Coalition | date=[[June 8]], [[1999]] | url=http://www.freemumia.com/beverlydeclaration.html | accessdate=2007-11-23}}</ref> Abu-Jamal's sworn statement avers that he had been sitting in his cab across the street when he first heard shouting, then saw a police vehicle, then heard the sound of gunshots. It asserts that, upon seeing his brother appearing disoriented across the street, he ran to him and was shot by a uniformed police officer. He claims to have no memory of the events between being shot by Faulkner and the arrival of officers at the scene and to have been abused by the police while he was still in need of medical assistance for his wound. It concludes with his claim of innocence: "I never said I shot the policeman. I did not shoot the policeman…I never said I hoped he died. I would never say something like that."<ref name="mum"/>

For a similar period, William Cook also did not testify or make any statement whatsoever about events other than his utterance at the crimescene, "I ain't got nothing to do with this."<ref>{{cite news | last=Lopez | first=Steve | title=Wrong Guy, Good Cause | publisher=[[Time Magazine]] | date=[[July 23]], [[2000]] | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,50613,00.html | accessdate=2007-11-23}}</ref> On [[April 29]], [[2001]], Cook belatedly declared that he would be willing to testify and that both he and his brother "had nothing do with shooting or killing the policeman".

Several others have made statements in support of Abu-Jamal. At a post-conviction review hearing of [[August 11]], [[1995]], William "Dales" Singletary testified that he directly witnessed the shooting and that the gunman was the passenger in Cook's car wearing a army overcoat. Singletary said that police tore up his written statements and that he was prevailed upon to sign a different statement which they dictated.<ref>{{cite web| title=PCRA hearing transcript pp.204 ff.| work=Commonwealth vs. Mumia Abu-Jamal aka Wesley Cook| publisher=Court of Common Pleas, First Judicial District of Pennsylvania, Criminal Trial Division| date=[[August 11]], [[1995]] | url=http://www.justice4danielfaulkner.com/pcra/95-08-11.html#singletary| accessdate=2007-11-23}}</ref> Singletary's account was deemed "not credible" and "medically impossible" (Singletary claimed that Faulkner spoke after being shot in the eye at point blank range, which would have been instantaneously lethal, and that a police helicopter was in attendance, which no other witnesses described).<ref name="yn"/> Police officer Vernon Jones testified three days later, that at the crimescene Singletary had inquired of him what had transpired and said that he not witnessed any shooting other than hearing some shots that he thought were firecrackers.<ref>{{cite web| title=PCRA hearing transcript pp.16 ff.| work=Commonwealth vs. Mumia Abu-Jamal aka Wesley Cook| publisher=Court of Common Pleas, First Judicial District of Pennsylvania, Criminal Trial Division| date=[[August 14]], [[1995]] | url=http://www.justice4danielfaulkner.com/pcra/95-08-14.html#jones| accessdate=2007-11-06}}</ref> William Harmon, a [[pimp]] in 1981 with convictions for forgery, fraud and theft by deception, testified that he had seen a man other than Abu-Jamal execute Faulkner and flee in a car which pulled up at the crimescene.<ref>{{cite web | title=PCRA hearing transcript pp.45 ff. | work=Commonwealth vs. Mumia Abu-Jamal aka Wesley Cook | publisher=Court of Common Pleas, First Judicial District of Pennsylvania, Criminal Trial Division | date=[[August 10]], [[1995]] | url=http://www.justice4danielfaulkner.com/pcra/95-08-10.html#harmon | accessdate=2007-10-18}}</ref> Court stenographer Terri Maurer-Carter stated in an affidavit of August 2001 that the presiding Judge had exclaimed, "Yeah, and I'm going to help them fry the nigger", in the course of a conversation regarding Abu-Jamal's case.<ref>{{cite web | last=Maurer-Carter | first=Terri | title=Declaration of Terri Maurer-Carter | publisher=Free Mumia Coalition | date=[[August 21]], [[2001]] | url=http://www.mumia.de/doc/aktuell/20010903mde02en.html | accessdate=2007-11-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last=Bryan | first=Robert R. | coauthors=Judith L.

==Verdict, death sentence, and reactions==
The jury delivered a unanimous guilty verdict after three hours of deliberations. In the sentencing phase of the trial Abu-Jamal read to the jury from a prepared statement and was then sworn and cross-examined about issues relevant to the assessment of his character by Joseph McGill, the prosecuting attorney.<ref>{{cite web | title=Trial transcript, pp.3–34 | work=Commonwealth vs. Mumia Abu-Jamal aka Wesley Cook | publisher=Court of Common Please, Philadelphia Criminal Trial Division | date=[[July 3]], [[1982]] | url=http://www.justice4danielfaulkner.com/Days/7-3-82.html | accessdate=2007-11-23}}</ref> In his statement Abu-Jamal criticized his attorney as a "legal trained lawyer" who was imposed on him against his will who "knew he was inadequate to the task and chose to follow the directions of this black-robed conspirator, [Judge] Albert Sabo, even if it meant ignoring my directions." He claimed that his rights had been "deceitfully stolen" from him by the Judge, particularly focusing on the denial of his request to receive defense assistance from [[John Africa]] and his being prevented from proceeding [[pro se]]. He quoted remarks of John Africa and declared himself "innocent of these charges".<ref>{{cite web | title=Trial transcript, pp.10–16 | work=Commonwealth vs. Mumia Abu-Jamal aka Wesley Cook | publisher=Court of Common Please, Philadelphia Criminal Trial Division | date=[[July 3]], [[1982]] | url=http://www.justice4danielfaulkner.com/Days/7-3-82.html | accessdate=2007-11-23}}</ref>

The Philadelphia Office of the [[District Attorney]], Daniel Faulkner's family, including his wife Maureen, the [[Fraternal Order of Police]], and other law-enforcement-related organizations have expressed approval of the conviction and sentence—being of a view that Abu-Jamal murdered Faulkner while the latter was making a lawful arrest in the line of police duty, and that Abu-Jamal had received a fair trial.<ref>{{cite web | title=Justice for Daniel Faulkner | date=2007 | url=http://www.danielfaulkner.com/ | accessdate=2007-10-18}}</ref> District Attorney [[Lynne Abraham]], who at times has supervised aspects of the Abu-Jamal case, is on record stating that it was the "most open-and-shut murder case" she had ever tried,<ref>{{cite web | last=Gibson | first=Dave | title=25 Years Later...Still No Justice for Officer Daniel Faulkner | publisher=The American Daily | date=[[January 13]], [[2007]] | url=http://www.americandaily.com/article/17215 | accessdate=2007-10-18}}</ref> and that Abu-Jamal: <blockquote>"Never produced his own brother, who was present at the time of the murder, (yet) he has offered up various individuals who would claim that one trial witness or another must have lied; or that some other individual has only recently been discovered who has special knowledge about the murder; or that someone has fallen out of the skies, who is supposedly willing to confess to the murder of Officer Faulkner."<ref>{{cite web | last=Saunders | first=Debra J. | title=Mumia finds safety in numbers | publisher=[[Jewish World Review]] | date=[[December 21]], [[2001]] | url=http://www.jewishworldreview.com/1201/saunders122101.asp | accessdate=2007-10-18}}</ref></blockquote>

On [[December 6]], [[2005]], the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]] admitted four issues for appeal of the ruling of the United States District Court:<ref>{{cite news | last=Lindorff | first=Dave | title=A victory for Mumia | publisher=[[Salon.com]] | date=[[December 8]], [[2005]] | url=http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2005/12/08/mumia/index.html | accessdate=2007-10-18}}</ref>
* in relation to sentencing, whether the jury verdict form had been flawed and the judge's instructions to the jury had been confusing 
* in relation to conviction and sentencing, whether racial bias in [[jury selection]] existed to an extent tending to produce an inherently biased jury and therefore an unfair trial (the ''[[Batson v. Kentucky|Batson]]'' claim) 
* in relation to conviction, whether the prosecutor improperly attempted to reduce jurors' sense of responsibility by telling them that a guilty verdict would be subsequently vetted and subject to appeal
* in relation to post-conviction review hearings in 1995–6, whether the presiding Judge—who had also presided at the trial—demonstrated unacceptable bias in his conduct.

The Third Circuit Court heard oral arguments in the appeals on [[May 17]], [[2007]], at the United States Courthouse in Philadelphia. The appeal panel consisted of Chief Judge [[Anthony Joseph Scirica]], Judge [[Thomas L. Ambro|Thomas Ambro]], and Judge [[Robert E. Cowen|Robert Cowen]]. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania sought to reinstate the sentence of death, on the basis that Yohn's ruling was flawed, as he should have deferred to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court which had already ruled on the issue of sentencing, and the ''Batson'' claim was invalid because Abu-Jamal made no complaints during the original jury selection. Abu-Jamal's counsel told the Third Circuit Court that Abu-Jamal did not get a fair trial because the judge was a racist and the jury was both racially-biased and misinformed.<ref>{{cite web | last=Duffy | first=Shannon P. | title=Spectators Pack Courtroom as 3rd Circuit Hears Appeal in Mumia Abu-Jamal Case | publisher=The Legal Intelligencer | date=[[May 18]], [[2007]] | url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1179392702456 | accessdate=2007-11-23}}</ref> Current Pennsylvania Governor [[Ed Rendell]] favors the death penalty and had signed 73 execution warrants as of September 2007.<ref>{{cite press release | title=Governor Rendell signs execution warrant for Ramon Sanchez | publisher=Commonwealth of Pennsylvania | date=[[September 21]], [[2007]] | url=http://www.state.pa.us/papower/cwp/view.asp?A=11&Q=467652 | accessdate=2007-11-23}}</ref>

In 1999, he was invited to deliver the keynote address for the graduating class at [[The Evergreen State College]].

While his spoken word commentaries are recorded regularly, and may be listened to online at [[Prison Radio]],<ref>{{cite web | last =Abu-Jamal | first =Mumia | title =Mumia Abu-Jamal's Radio Broadcasts - essay transcripts and archived mp3 | publisher =PrisonRadio.org | url =http://www.PrisonRadio.org/mumia.htm | accessdate =2007-10-18}}</ref> and he continues to write a Saturday weekly column for the [[German language]] [[Marxism|Marxist]] newspaper [[junge Welt]], restrictions have at times been imposed upon his activities. In 1995, he was punished with [[solitary confinement]] for engaging in entrepreneurship contrary to prison regulations. Subsequent to the airing of the 1996 [[HBO]] documentary ''Mumia Abu-Jamal: A Case for Reasonable Doubt?'', which included footage from visitation interviews conducted with him, the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections acted to ban outsiders from using any recording equipment in state prisons.<ref name = "tsb"/> In litigation before the US Court of Appeals in 1998 he successfully established his right to write for reward in prison. The same litigation also established that the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections had illegally opened his mail in an attempt to establish whether he was writing for financial gain.<ref>{{cite paper | author=[[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]] | title=Opinion in ''Mumia Abu-Jamal v.

In his poetry book ''Death Blossoms'', he expresses his belief, which follows no denomination, in a Mother God who coexists with all male religious understandings and which he refers to by the name of "Mama".

=== Claim of 1992 confession ===
In 1999, a volunteer named Phillip Bloch claimed that he visited Abu-Jamal in prison in 1992 and asked him whether he regretted killing Faulkner, to which Abu-Jamal replied, "Yes."<ref name="vf">{{cite news | last =Bissinger | first =Buzz | title =The Famous And The Dead | pages =6 and 13| publisher =Vanity Fair | date =August 1999 | url=http://www.danielfaulkner.com/docs/VanityFair.pdf | accessdate =2007-10-18}}</ref> Bloch, otherwise a supporter of Abu-Jamal's case, stated he came forward after he grew concerned about the vilification of Daniel Faulkner.<ref name="vf"/> In response, Abu-Jamal is reported to have said "A lie is a lie, whether made today or 10 years later", and thanked ''Vanity Fair'' "...not for their work but for stoking this controversy, because controversy leads to questioning, and one can only question this belated confession."<ref>{{cite news | last =Mackler | first =Jeff | title =Vanity Fair and ABC-TV Stories of Mumia's 'Confession' Collapse | publisher =[[Socialist Action (US)]] | date =August 1999 | url =http://www.socialistaction.org/news/199908/confession.html | accessdate = 2007-10-18}}</ref>
