'''Sir Thomas Sean Connery''' (born [[August 25]] [[1930]]) is an [[Academy Award]]-, [[Golden Globe]]-, and [[BAFTA Award]]-winning [[United Kingdom|British]] [[actor]] and [[film producer|producer]] who is perhaps best known as the first actor to portray [[James Bond (character)|James Bond]] in cinema, starring in seven Bond films.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4799550.stm|title=Profile: Sean Connery|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|accessdate=2007-03-19|date=2006-03-12}}</ref> In 1987 he won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his role in ''[[The Untouchables (1987 film)|The Untouchables]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popculturemadness.com/Trivia/Oscars/Top-1987-O.html|title=popculture.com's  Oscar Winners Archive|publisher=www.popculturemadness.com|accessdate=2008-05-13}}</ref> Sir Sean Connery was knighted by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in July 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seanconnery.com/biography/knighthood|title=Official website's entry on 2000 knighthood|publisher=www.seanconnery.com|accessdate=2007-09-29}}</ref>

Connery is known for retaining his [[Scottish English|Scottish accent]] in films, regardless of the [[nationality]] of the character played.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4180373.stm|title=Connery's accent is UK favourite|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|accessdate=2007-03-19|date=2005-01-17}}</ref> Despite being older than most contemporary [[sex symbols]], he has repeatedly been named as one of the most attractive men alive by various magazines due to his rugged good looks.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Connery was born in [[Fountainbridge]], [[Edinburgh]], the son of Euphamia C. "Effie" ([[married and maiden names|née]] Maclean), a cleaning woman, and Joseph Connery, a factory worker and truck driver.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/58/Sean-Connery.html|title=Sean Connery Biography|publisher=www.filmreference.com|accessdate=2007-09-29}}</ref> His father was a [[Roman Catholicism in Scotland|Roman Catholic]] of [[Irish-Scots|Irish descent]] with roots in [[County Wexford]], while his mother was a Scottish [[Protestant]]. He claims he was called Sean, his middle name, long before becoming an actor, explaining that he had an Irish friend named Séamus and those who knew them decided to call him by his middle name when with Séamus.

His first job was as a milkman in Edinburgh with [[St. Cuthbert's Co-operative Society]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://heritage.scotsman.com/greatscots.cfm?id=2275262005|title=From the Co-op with love.. the days Sir Sean earned £1 a week|publisher=[[The Scotsman]]|accessdate=2007-09-29|date=2005-11-21}}</ref> He then joined the [[Royal Navy]], but was later [[discharge]]d on medical grounds because of a duodenal [[ulcer]]. Afterwards, he returned to the co-op, then worked at other jobs, including a lorry driver, a labourer and an [[Model (art)|artist's model]] for the [[Edinburgh College of Art]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.scotsman.com/entertainment.cfm?id=924382003|title=Even as an unknown, Sean was still a draw|publisher=[[The Scotsman]]|accessdate=2007-09-29|date=2003-08-22}}</ref> coffin polisher and [[bodybuilder]]. 

According to Connery's official website, he placed third in the 1953 [[Mr. Universe]] bodybuilding contest. Fellow competitor, Johnny Isaacs, suggested him an audition for a stage production of ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]''. This led Connery to stage, television, and film work. A prominent television role was in [[Rudolph Cartier]]'s 1961 production of ''[[Anna Karenina]]'' for [[BBC Television]], in which he co-starred with [[Claire Bloom]].<ref name="karenina">{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/1181098/index.html|title=Cartier, Rudolph (1904&ndash;1994)|first=Oliver|last=Wake|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|accessdate=2007-02-25}}</ref> He also acted in ''[[Darby O'Gill and the Little People]]'' (1956) starring Albert Sharpe.

When he was younger, Connery was a keen [[association football|football]]er, having played for a team called Bonnyrigg Rose. He was even offered a trial with [[East Fife F.C.|East Fife]]. While on tour with the cast of ''South Pacific'', Connery was involved in a football match against a local team that [[Matt Busby]], manager of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], happened to be scouting at the time. According to reports, Busby offered Connery a contract worth [[Pound sterling|£]]25-a-week immediately after the game. Connery admits that he was tempted to accept the offer, but he recalls "I realised that a top-class footballer could be over the hill by the age of 30, and I was already 23. I decided to become an actor and it turned out to be one of my more intelligent moves."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.footballcentral.org/sfa/associations/scottish-junior-football-association/junior_game/sean_connery.cfm |title=NoNo7 |accessdate=2008-05-19 |year=2005 |month=April |publisher=Mud & Glory }}</ref>

His first American television role was as a porter in an episode of ''[[The Jack Benny Show]]''.

===James Bond (1962–1967, 1971, 1983)===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:SeanConnerydrno.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Connery as James Bond in ''[[From Russia With Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]''.]] -->
Connery's breakthrough came in the role of secret agent [[James Bond]]. He acted in seven Bond films, six produced by [[EON Productions|EON]], followed by an unofficial [[Warner Brothers]] ''Thunderball''-remake:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000125/ |title=Sean Connery filmography |publisher=[[IMDb]] |accessdate=2007-03-19}}</ref> These include ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' ([[1962 in film|1962]]), ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'' ([[1963 in film|1963]]), ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' ([[1964 in film|1964]]), ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' ([[1965 in film|1965]]), ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'' ([[1967 in film|1967]]), ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' ([[1971 in film|1971]]) and ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'' ([[1983 in film|1983]]) (unofficial).

The imposing, yet light-footed, actor was co-discovered by [[Harry Saltzman]], and [[Albert R. Broccoli]] after other aspirants to the Bond role were eliminated, including [[David Niven]] (later to play Bond in the spoof ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]'', in 1967), [[Cary Grant]], and [[James Mason]]; the latter two refused to commit to a film series. The low budget forced the producers to hire an unknown actor.

James Bond's creator, [[Ian Fleming]] doubted the casting, saying, "He's not what I envisioned of James Bond looks" and "I’m looking for Commander Bond and not an overgrown stunt-man," adding that Connery (muscular, 6' 2", and a Scot) was unrefined. However, Fleming's girlfriend told him Connery had the requisite sexual charisma. Fleming changed his mind after the successful ''Dr. No'' premiere; he was so impressed, he created a half-Scottish, half-Swiss heritage for the literary James Bond in the later novels.

Connery's portrayal of Bond owes much to stylistic tutelage from director [[Terence Young (director)|Terence Young]], polishing the actor while using his physical grace and presence for the action. Robert Cotton wrote in one Connery biography that [[Lois Maxwell]] (the first [[Miss Moneypenny]]) noticed, "Terence took Sean under his wing. He took him to dinner, showed him how to walk, how to talk, even how to eat." Cotton wrote, "Some cast members remarked that Connery was simply doing a Terence Young impression, but Young and Connery knew they were on the right track."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hmss.com/films/young.htm |title=Terence Young: James Bond's Creator? |publisher=www.hmss.com |accessdate=2007-09-29}}</ref>

In June 1967, after filming ''You Only Live Twice'', Connery quit the role, having become tired of repetitive plots, a lack of character development, the public's demands of him, and fear of being [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]]. He also disliked the fantastic direction in which the series was headed, away from the source material. Connery reportedly wanted to be a co-producer of the series, his inspiration being [[Dean Martin]]'s role as a co-producer of the [[Matt Helm]] series. Connery noted that ''[[The Silencers (film)|The Silencers]]'' made nowhere near as much money as ''Thunderball,'' but Martin made more money than he did.

In 1970, United Artists agreed to finance Connery's production of ''[[The Offence]]''. Connery's final official appearance as 007 was in [[1971 in film|1971]]'s ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]''; he reportedly declined £5 million to make ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'' (1973).

In 1978, owing to complex dealings between [[EON Productions]] and [[Kevin McClory]] (co-producer of ''Thunderball'' and co-creator of the story in [[Ian Fleming]]'s eponymous novel), the latter obtained the right to re-make ''Thunderball.'' McClory and Connery were to write an original Bond film, titled either ''James Bond of the Secret Service'' or ''Warhead'', but EON and [[United Artists]] blocked it in court. 

The re-make was revived in the 1980s, and Connery was to play Bond for the seventh, and final, time in the "unofficial" film ''Never Say Never Again''; its title is said to derive from Connery's comment after filming ''Diamonds Are Forever'' that he'd never again play Bond. Yet, in 2005, Connery again reprised the role with his voice and physical likeness in the [[From Russia with Love (video game)|video game adaptation of ''From Russia with Love'']].

His favorite Bond film is ''From Russia with Love'', one of the most acclaimed in the series, which he confirmed in a 2002 interview with [[Sam Donaldson]] for ABCNews.com.; ([[American Movie Classics]] mistakenly listed ''Thunderball'' as Connery's favourite during a Bond retrospective).

More than forty years after playing the role, Connery's incarnation remains as the definitive cinema James Bond, despite popular interpretations by [[Roger Moore]], [[Timothy Dalton]] (often considered akin to the literary Bond), [[Pierce Brosnan]], and [[Daniel Craig]]. Connery's feelings about James Bond range from resentment to fondness, once saying he hated the character so much that he'd have killed him, but also saying he never hated Bond, but merely wanted to portray other characters. Certainly, when the James Bond series was at its peak in the mid-1960s, his association with James Bond 007 was so great that his performances in films, such as [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'', ''[[A Fine Madness]]'', and [[Sidney Lumet]]'s ''[[The Hill (film)|The Hill]]'', were ignored. When asked if he'd ever escape the identification, he replied, "Never, it's with me 'til I go in the box."{{citequote}}

At another point, he said he still cared about the future of the character and the franchise, having been its icon for too long not to care, and that all Bond films had their good points.

===Post-James Bond career===
Although Bond was his most famous role, Connery has also maintained a successful career since. As part of the agreement to appear in ''Diamonds are Forever'', Connery was given carte blanche to produce two films for United Artists, but felt that the only film made under this deal, ''The Offence'', was buried by the studio. Apart from ''[[The Man Who Would Be King (film)|The Man Who Would Be King]],'' most of Connery's successes in the next decade were as part of ensemble casts in films such as ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]]'' and ''[[A Bridge Too Far (film)|A Bridge Too Far]]'' (in which he acted in a scene opposite [[Sir Laurence Olivier]]). His portrayal of Berber chieftain [[Mulai Ahmed er Raisuli]] in [[John Milius]]'s ''[[The Wind and the Lion]]'' (1975) gained him considerable acclaim from critics and audiences and showed his range as an actor. 
[[Image:Sean Connery 1980 Crop.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Connery in 1980]]
In 1981, Sean Connery appeared in the film ''[[Time Bandits]]'' as [[Agamemnon]]. The casting choice derives from a joke [[Michael Palin]] included in the script, in which he describes the character as being "Sean Connery (or someone of equal, but cheaper, stature)". However, when shown the script, Connery was happy to play the supporting role. The brevity of his appearance in this film has been hailed by some as refreshing.

After his experience with ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'' in 1983 and the following court case, Connery became unhappy with the major studios and for two years did not make any films. 
Following the successful European production ''[[The Name of the Rose (film)|The Name of the Rose]]'' (1986), for which he won a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] award, Connery's interest in more credible material was revived. That same year, a supporting role in ''[[Highlander (film)|Highlander]]'' showcased his ability to play older mentors to younger leads, which would become a recurring role in many of his later films. The following year, his acclaimed performance as a hard-nosed cop in ''[[The Untouchables (1987 film)|The Untouchables]]'' (1987) earned him an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. The media reported that the producers wanted him for the movie but could not afford his salary, so he agreed to do the movie for $50,000 with a ten percent share of the proceeds.  The expectation was that the movie would not make much money, but it exceeded all expectations and Sean Connery reaped a large amount of money.  It was one of the most publicized times that an actor had benefited so greatly from having "bet" on the future of the film and since then other actors have parlayed their acting skills into taking less up front for a part of the proceeds.

Subsequent box-office hits such as ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' (1989), in which he played Dr. [[Henry Jones Sr.]], the father of [[Harrison Ford]]'s titular character, actually only 12 years his junior), ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]'' (1990) (where he was reportedly called in at two weeks notice),''[[The Russia House]]'' (1990), ''[[The Rock (film)|The Rock]]'' (1996), and ''[[Entrapment (film)|Entrapment]]'' (1999) re-established him as an actor capable of playing major parts. Both ''Last Crusade'' and ''The Rock'' alluded to his James Bond days. [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[George Lucas]] wanted "the father of [[Indiana Jones]]" to be Connery since Bond directly inspired the ''[[Indiana Jones franchise#Films|Indiana Jones]]'' series, while his character in ''The Rock'', John Patrick Mason, was a British secret service agent imprisoned since the 1960s. 

In more recent years, Connery's filmography has included several box office and critical disappointments such as ''[[The Avengers (film)|The Avengers]]'' (1998), ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (film)|The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' (2003) and ''[[First Knight]]'' (1995), but he also received positive reviews for films including ''[[Finding Forrester]]'' (2000). He also later received a [[Crystal Globe]] for outstanding artistic contribution to world cinema. He has often been criticised for never losing his accent, even when playing [[Russians|Russian]] and [[Irish people|Irish]] characters, but he has said this is out of respect for his country.

In 1987&ndash;88, Connery was to star in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[television series]] ''[[Red Dwarf]]''. Connery was to appear as the captain of the spaceship ''[[Red Dwarf ships#Red Dwarf|Red Dwarf]]''. However, the role was written as being slightly overweight and inept, and so, with the part not being a good fit for Connery, it eventually went to an American comedy actor, [[Mac McDonald]]. This was revealed in the ''Red Dwarf'' Series I DVD commentary.

===Retirement===
In September 2004, media reports indicated that Connery intended to retire after pulling out of ''[[Josiah's Canon]]'', which was set for a 2005 release. However, in a December 2004 interview with ''[[The Scotsman]]'' newspaper from his home in the [[Bahamas]], Connery explained he had taken a break from acting in order to concentrate on writing his [[autobiography]]. The book project was later abandoned because the publishers wanted to delve too far into his private life.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

About a month before his 75th birthday, over the weekend of July 30/31, 2005, it was reported that he had decided to retire from film-making following disillusionment with the "idiots now in Hollywood", and the turmoil making (and subsequent box office failure of) the 2003 film ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (film)|The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.scotsman.com/entertainment.cfm?id=1707662005|title=Never say never, but Connery ends career|publisher=[[The Scotsman]]|accessdate=2007-09-29|date=2005-07-31}}</ref>

He stated in interviews for the film included on the DVD release that he was offered roles in both ''[[The Matrix]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|The Lord of the Rings]]'' series, declining both due to "not understanding them". After they went on to become huge hits, he decided to accept the ''League'' role, despite not "understanding" it either. At the [[Tartan Day]] celebrations in [[New York]] in March 2006, Connery again confirmed his retirement from acting, and stated that he is now writing a history book.

He was planning to star in an $80 million movie about [[Saladin]] and the [[Crusades]] that would be filmed in [[Jordan]] before the producer [[Moustapha Akkad]] was killed in the [[2005 Amman bombings]]. Connery received the [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI Life Achievement Award|Lifetime Achievement Award]] on [[8 June]] [[2006]], where he again confirmed his retirement from acting. On [[7 June]] [[2007]], he denied rumours that he would appear in the [[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull|fourth ''Indiana Jones'']] film, stating that "retirement is just too much damned fun".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6733177.stm|title=Connery bows out of Indiana film|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2007-09-29|date=2007-06-08}}</ref>

Sean Connery however did return to voice acting, playing the title character in the animated short, "Sir Billi the Vet".<ref>{{imdb title|id=0851471|title=Sir Billi the Vet}}</ref>

===Personal life===

In the making of the film ''[[Another Time, Another Place (1958 film)|Another Time, Another Place]]'' (1958), Connery was rumored to have been having an affair with [[Lana Turner]], his co-star. [[Johnny Stompanato]], her [[mobster]] boyfriend, stormed onto the set and pointed a gun at him, only to have Connery take the gun from Stompanato, beat him up, and force him from the set.<ref>[http://www.strongsville-ohio.net/data/columns/entertainment/archive/0011.html That's Hollywood!<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Connery was married to the [[Australia|Australian-born]] actress [[Diane Cilento]] from 1962 to 1973 (he was her second husband). They have one son, [[Jason Connery]] (born [[January 11]], [[1963]]) who was educated at [[Millfield School]] in [[Somerset]], [[England]] and the rigorous [[Gordonstoun]] boarding school in Scotland, before going on to become an actor. According to Jason, his parents' divorce was an extremely bitter and painful affair. Diane Cilento wrote an autobiography that paints an unflattering portrait of her ex-husband (see Accusations of abuse paragraph below). 

In 1975, Sean Connery married [[France|French]] artist [[Micheline Roquebrune]] who is the grandmother of French television journalist Stéphanie Renouvin.

He has a grandson Dashiell Quinn Connery (born in June, 1997) from his son Jason's marriage to actress [[Mia Sara]].

He holds an honorary shodan in [[Kyokushin]] karate.

====Accusations of abuse====

In her autobiography ''My Nine Lives'', as well as in subsequent interviews on radio and in print, [[Diane Cilento]] claimed that Connery had beaten her on several occasions. Connery vehemently denied the accusations.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=652&id=1993262005 |title=Jealous Connery beat me, says ex-wife |publisher=Scotsman |accessdate=2007-09-29 |date=2005-09-25 |first=Stuart |last=MacDonald}}</ref> In a December 1987 interview with [[Barbara Walters]], he caused an uproar by stating that it was okay for a man to slap a woman with limited force if it was required to calm her down or "keep her in line".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FgMLROTqJ0 interview|title=Youtube video of Connery interview|publisher=[[Youtube]]|accessdate=2007-09-29}}</ref> In the interview, Walters referred to his remarks in a November 1965 interview in ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine on the set of ''Thunderball''. In ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' in 1993, he said: "There are women who take it to the wire. That's what they are looking for, the ultimate confrontation. They want a smack."

===Political causes===
[[Image:ConneryKilt.jpg|thumb|Sean Connery at a [[Tartan Day]] celebration in [[Washington D.C.]] shown wearing the [[Clan Maclean]] hunting tartan]]
Connery has long supported the [[Scottish National Party]], a left-of-centre political party campaigning for [[Scottish independence]], both financially and through personal appearances. His involvement in [[Scottish politics]] has attracted considerable criticism since he has not resided in Scotland for more than fifty years, being labelled a "tax exile" amongst other things.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/article740029.ece|title=Interview: Jasper Gerard talks to Sean Connery|publisher=[[The Times]]|accessdate=2007-09-29|date=2006-03-12}}</ref> Fellow Scot and actor [[Ewan McGregor]] was quoted as saying of Connery that he "resented being told how to feel about Scotland by someone who hadn't lived there in 25 years".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=515&id=762612003 | publisher = [[Scotland on Sunday]] | title=The force is with him | last=Synnot | first=Siobhan  | date=[[2003-07-13]] | accessdate=2007-06-07}}</ref>

His support for the SNP is illustrated by a comment from his official website:

<blockquote>While it is generally accepted that his support of Scotland's independence and the Scottish National Party delayed his knighthood for many years, his commitment to Scotland has never wavered. [[Politics of the United Kingdom|Politics in the United Kingdom]] often has more intrigue than a James Bond plot. While Scotland is not yet independent, she does have a [[Scottish Parliament|new parliament]]. Sir Sean campaigned hard for the yes vote during the [[Scotland referendum, 1997|Scottish Referendum]] that created the new [[Scottish Parliament]]. He believes firmly that the Scottish Parliament will grow in power and that Scotland will be independent within his lifetime.|30px|30px|SeanConnery.com on Sean Connery's support of the Scottish National Party<ref>[http://www.seanconnery.com/biography/knighthood/ The Official Website of Sir Sean Connery - Knighthood<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref></blockquote>

Connery has "Scotland Forever" tattooed on his arm, and used his fee from ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' (1971) to establish a [[Charitable organization|charity]] to support poor children in Edinburgh, as well as Scottish [[film production]]. He has said that he will return to Scotland when it is granted independence. He suggested in 1997 that the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour government]] had prevented him being knighted for his charitable work because of his support for the SNP. At the time a Labour Party spokesman stated Connery's knighthood had been blocked because of the numerous remarks that the actor had made in past interviews condoning violence and physical abuse towards women. Connery was widely accused of [[hypocrisy]] for accepting a knighthood from the monarch of the United Kingdom when he openly opposes that system.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

Connery received the ''[[Légion d'honneur]]'' in 1991. He received [[Kennedy Center Honors]] from the [[United States]] in 1999, presented to him by President [[Bill Clinton]]. He received a knighthood as a [[Knight Bachelor]] on [[July 5]], [[2000]], wearing a hunting [[tartan]] [[kilt]] of the [[Clan Maclean|MacLean of Duart]] [[Scottish clan|clan]]. He also received the [[Orden de Manuel Amador Guerrero]] from [[Mireya Moscoso]], former president of [[Panama]] on [[11 March]] [[2003]], for his talent and versatility as an actor.

===Health===
In 1993, news that Connery was undergoing [[radiation treatment]] for an undisclosed throat ailment sparked media reports that the actor was suffering from [[Esophageal cancer|throat cancer]] following years of heavy [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]], and he was falsely declared dead by the Japanese and South African news agencies. Connery immediately appeared on the [[David Letterman]] show to deny all of this. In a February 1995 interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', he said that the radiation treatment was to remove [[vocal fold nodule|nodules]] from his vocal cords. His father, a heavy smoker, died from [[Esophageal cancer|throat cancer]] in 1972. In 2003, he had surgery to remove [[cataracts]] from both eyes. On [[March 12]], [[2006]], he announced he was recovering from surgery to remove a kidney tumour in January. In June 2008 he chipped a bone in his shoulder while playing golf in New York.<ref>http://news.scotsman.com/seanconnery/I39ll-be-there-for-shure.4187412.jp</ref>

===Connery in popular culture===

Connery's distinctive speaking voice has sometimes made him a target of satire, most notably in the recurring ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketch "[[Celebrity Jeopardy! (Saturday Night Live)|Celebrity Jeopardy!]]", in which Connery is portrayed by [[Darrell Hammond]]. Hammond also portrayed Connery in a spoof film trailer in which he Connery appeared as [[Papa Smurf]] in a live action film. 

Connery's role in ''[[Finding Forrester]]'', specifically his line "You're the man now, dog!", became the inspiration for the popular website [[YTMND.com]].

He was voted to have the worst movie accent by ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', for his performance in ''[[The Untouchables (1987 film)|The Untouchables]]''. He has been derided, but also applauded, for using his natural speaking voice and accent for every character, despite playing roles as diverse as an [[Irish American]] Chicago cop (''The Untouchables''), King [[Richard I of England]] (''[[Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves]]'') and a [[Lithuanian SSR|Lithuanian Soviet]] submarine captain (''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/3032052.stm|title=Connery 'has worst film accent'|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2007-09-29|date=2003-06-30}}</ref>

He has an [[asteroid]] named after him, [[13070 Seanconnery]].

Connery is frequently referred to in [[Irvine Welsh|Irvine Welsh's]] 1993 novel [[Trainspotting (novel)|Trainspotting]], as one of the central characters, Sick Boy, is a great fan of Connery's work. He is also  mentioned several times in the [[1996 in film|1996]] [[film]] [[Trainspotting (film)|of the same name]], directed by [[Danny Boyle]].

[[United Kingdom|British]] [[comedian]] [[Eddie Izzard]] frequently uses the voice of Sean Connery in his stand-up routines, portraying such diverse figures as [[Noah]] and [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]]. When playing the former, Connery is usually seen interacting with Izzard's famous [[James Mason]] "voice of [[God]]."
