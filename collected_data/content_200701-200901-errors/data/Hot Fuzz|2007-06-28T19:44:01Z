'''''Hot Fuzz''''' is a [[2007 in film|2007]] [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British]] police [[action film|action]]/[[comedy film|comedy]] film written by [[Simon Pegg]] and [[Edgar Wright]], known for the motion picture ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'' and the television series ''[[Spaced]]''. It was directed by [[Edgar Wright]] and produced by [[Nira Park]]. 

==Plot==
<!-- Move information that isn't so important to the Cast section to describe characters, ala the Star Wars/Lord of the Rings articles.-->
<!-- Please do not add spoiler warnings to the top and bottom of this section - as stated in Wikipedia policy regarding spoilers (which can be found in the [[Wikipedia:Spoiler]] article), spoiler warnings are unnecessary in sections in which it is already assumed that there will be spoilers,such as plot summaries.

Nicholas Angel, an extremely dedicated and over-achieving [[police officer]] in [[London]]'s [[Metropolitan Police Service]], is so good that he makes everyone else on the service look bad. As a result his superiors send him to a place where his talents won’t be quite so embarrassing: the sleepy and seemingly crime-free [[village]] of [[Sandford]], where there hasn't been a recorded murder for twenty years. Once there, he is partnered with well-meaning but overeager and naive police constable Danny Butterman, the son of local police chief Inspector Frank Butterman. A committed action movie fan, Danny is in awe of his new big-city partner, believing him to be a real-life "[[Bad Boys II|bad boy]]" who just might provide him with his chance to experience the life of gunfights and car chases he so longs for. Angel, meanwhile, struggles to adjust to the quiet and uneventful pace of the village, and despite clearing up several otherwise unnoticed [[crime]]s and [[misdemeanor]]s in short order (such as shoplifters, underage drinkers and a farmer storing a huge supply of illegal weapons in his barn), soon finds his most pressing concern being a [[swan]] that has escaped from its owner. Faced with the reality of his situation, Angel and Danny eventually bond over drinks at the local pub and action movies.

Soon after Angel's arrival, a series of grisly "accidents" rock the village, all committed by an individual in a black hood and cloak. Increasingly convinced that Sandford is not what it seems, Angel begins to clash with the other officers on the force, in particular the two detectives who believe that he's nothing more than an uptight city cop with an overactive imagination. However, Angel refuses to drop the [[investigation]] and initially suspects Simon "Sissy"  Skinner, the charming but sinister manager of the local [[Somerfield (UK retailer)|Somerfield]] supermarket, of murdering the victims due to their involvement in a lucrative property deal.  His confrontation with Skinner only reveals Skinner's apparent innocence and further damages Angel's credibility with his colleagues. After being ambushed in his hotel room by the cloaked murderer, who is unmasked as the giant trolley boy of the Somerfield supermarket under the instruction of Skinner, Angel is led to a nearby castle where he discovers the truth&mdash;Inspector Butterman, Skinner and the [[Neighbourhood Watch]] Alliance (NWA), intent on keeping Sandford's title of "Village of the Year", have been murdering anyone who may potentially damage the village's image. Angel discovers the bodies of various "problem" people whom the NWA have disposed of (several of whom Angel had encountered earlier in the movie), before being cornered and stabbed by Danny, apparently a member of the NWA.

Angel is not harmed, however; having tricked the NWA into believing that Angel is dead, Danny instead drives him to the village limits and releases him, insisting that he knew nothing about their true activities. Danny urges Angel to flee, reasoning that no one would believe the truth about Sandford. However, whilst at a rest stop Angel sees the two movies he and Danny bonded over on a nearby sales rack (''[[Point Break]]'' and ''[[Bad Boys II]]'') and is inspired to stop the NWA once and for all; to that end, he drives back to town and arms himself with the confiscated weapons seized earlier in the movie. After Angel meets with Danny in the village, the two begin to dispatch the members of the NWA in an increasingly destructive and frantic series of gun fights. Initially confronted by their colleagues in the Sandford Police Service (who are quickly persuaded of the truth), Angel and Danny take the battle to the supermarket. Skinner and Inspector Butterman flee, and are pursued by Angel and Danny to a nearby model village, where both are eventually subdued. Although Angel's old supervisors arrive from London begging Angel to return, as their crime statistics have risen drastically seemingly as a result of his absence, Angel elects to remain in Sandford. Back at the police station, the Sandford Police celebrate their triumph and attempt to complete their paperwork, but are ambushed by a remaining member of the NWA.  He attempts to shoot Angel but Danny jumps in front of the blast.  In the resulting chaos a confiscated [[naval mine]]  is triggered and the station is destroyed. One year later,  Angel lays flowers on a grave marked 'Butterman'; it is revealed that Danny has survived, however, and that the grave is his mother's. Angel has been promoted to Inspector and Danny to Sergeant, and the film ends as they go back to working the beat together in Sandford.

The film's large ensemble cast also features appearances from comedians [[Bill Bailey]], [[Adam Buxton]], [[Steve Coogan]] (uncredited), [[Julia Deakin]], [[Martin Freeman]], [[Stephen Merchant]] and [[Robert Popper]] as well as featuring a number of well-known British actors, such as [[Bill Nighy]], [[Anne Reid]], [[Kenneth Cranham]], [[David Threlfall]], [[Paul Freeman]], and [[Stuart Wilson]].  

In an uncredited cameo ''[[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|The Lord of the Rings]]'' director, [[Peter Jackson]], played the part of the homicidal [[Father Christmas]], shown in the opening sequence stabbing Nicholas' hand prior to the events of the film. In another uncredited cameo, Nicholas Angel's masked forensic ex-girlfriend Janine is played by [[Cate Blanchett]].<ref>{{cite news | author = Olly Richards | title = Look Closer: Hot Fuzz | pages=50 |publisher = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date=[[2007-02-23]]}}</ref> British singer and actor [[Joseph McManners]] also played a cameo role as a schoolboy at the climatic battle scene of the movie, however, his background story and an entire sub-plot surrounding his character was cut from the final version and can only be found on the DVD.<ref name="joemcmanners-hot-fuzz-character">[http://www.joemcmanners.com Official News Updates] at www.joemcmanners.com (accessed [[June 23]], [[2007]])</ref> Also the film's director, [[Edgar Wright]], appears in the Somerfield supermarket, pushing a metal trolley (reflecting the fact that he did at one point work as a shelf stacker for Somerfield).

==Production==
Director Edgar Wright and star Simon Pegg spent eighteen months writing the script.<ref>{{cite web | author = Joe Utichi | title = Countryside Commandoes | publisher = Rotten Tomatoes | date = [[2007-02-13]] | url = http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/click/movie-1164807/reviews.php?rid=1598617 | accessdate = 2007-02-13}}</ref> During the latter half of 2005, [[Working Title Films|Working Title]] approached several towns in [[South West England]] looking for an appropriate filming location. Simon Pegg commented "We're both from the [[West Country]] so it just seemed like it was the perfect and logical thing to drag those kind of ideas and those genres and those clichés back to our beginnings to where we grew up, so you could see high-octane balls-to-the-wall action in [[Frome]]".<ref name="culture">{{cite episode | title = Week Four 2007 | episodelink =  | series = The Culture Show | serieslink = The Culture Show | station = [[BBC 2]] | airdate = 2007-02-10}}</ref>

Wright has commented "and Wells is very picturesque [...] I love it but I also want to trash it".<ref name="comedy map">{{cite episode | title = [http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedymap/episode2.shtml Episode 2 - Around the West Country and into Wales] | episodelink =  | series = The Comedy Map of Britain | serieslink =  | credits =  | network = [[BBC 2]] | station = | city =  | airdate = 2007-02-03}}</ref> Filming also took place at the [[Hendon Police College]], including the driving school skid pan and athletic track.<ref>[http://www.movielocationsguide.com/Hot_Fuzz/filming_locations List of locations used in Wells, Somerset]</ref>

Wright has said that it takes elements from his final amateur film, ''Dead Right'', which he described as both "''[[Lethal Weapon]]'' set in Somerset" and "a ''[[Dirty Harry]]'' film in Somerset".<ref name="comedy map">{{cite episode | title = [http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedymap/episode2.shtml Episode 2 - Around the West Country and into Wales] | episodelink =  | series = The Comedy Map of Britain | serieslink =  | credits =  | network = [[BBC 2]] | station = | city =  | airdate = 2007-02-03}}</ref>

The film parodies clichés used in other action movies. On the topic of perceived gun fetishes in these movies, Pegg has said "Men can't do that thing, which is the greatest achievement of humankind, which is to make another human, so we make metal versions of our own penises and fire more bits of metal out of the end into peoples heads [...] It's our turn to grab the gun by the hilt and fire it into your face".<ref name="culture">{{cite episode | title = Week Four 2007 | episodelink =  | series = The Culture Show | serieslink = The Culture Show | station = [[BBC 2]] | airdate = 2007-02-10}}</ref> Despite this, Pegg maintains that the film is not a spoof in that, '"They lack the sneer that a lot of parodies have that look down on their source material. Because we're looking up to it."<ref>{{cite news | author = Clark Collis | title = Brits and Giggles | publisher = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = [[2007-04-13]] | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20034733,00.html | accessdate=2007-04-17}}</ref> The film was scored by [[David Arnold]] (well known for his [[James Bond (films)|James Bond series]] scores since 1997).

Filming commenced on [[March 19]], [[2006]]<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.workingtitlefilms.com/newsArticle.php?newsID=115 | title=Filming under way on Hot Fuzz | publisher=Working Title Films | date=[[2006-03-20]]}}</ref> and lasted for 11 weeks.<ref name="channel4">{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/apps26/film/reviews/film.jsp?section=indepth&id=159113&page=3|title=Hot Fuzz|publisher=[[Channel 4]]}}</ref> Throughout the filming process Pegg, Frost and Wright recorded a regular [[video blog]] which is available on the ''Hot Fuzz'' section of the Working Title website.

The film had a limited release in [[Canada]] and the [[USA]] on [[20 April]] [[2007]]. The film carries a 15 certificate in the UK and is rated 14A in Canada for gory scenes and coarse language and is rated R in the US for violent content including some graphic images, and language.

==Box office and critical reception==
The film generated £7.1 million in its first weekend of release in UK cinema.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6379441.stm|title=Hot Fuzz heats up UK box office|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=[[2007-02-20]]}}</ref>

Critically, the movie received positive reviews, and was rated almost as highly as their previous film, ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/shaun_of_the_dead/|title=Shaun of the Dead|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref> It has a 89% fresh rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/hot_fuzz/|title=Hot Fuzz|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=2007-04-05}}</ref> and 8.4 on [[IMDB]], currently placing it at number 110 in its top 250 movies of all-time as voted for by its users.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425112/|title=Hot Fuzz|publisher=[[IMDB]]}}</ref> Olly Richards of ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' said of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost "After almost a decade together they’re clearly so comfortable in each other’s presence that they feel no need to fight for the punchline, making them terrific company for two hours".<ref>{{cite news | author = Olly Richards | title = Hot Fuzz | publisher = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | url = http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=10243 | accessdate=2007-02-23}}</ref> [[Johnny Vaughan]] of ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'' already called it the "most arresting Brit-com of 2007".<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Johnny Vaughan]]|title=The Plod Couple|publisher=[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]|date=[[2007-02-16]]|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2007070721,00.html|accessdate=2007-03-05}}</ref> Phillip French of ''[[The Observer]]'', who did not care for ''Shaun of the Dead'', warmed to the comedy team in this film.<ref>{{cite news|author=Phillip French|title=Hot Fuzz|publisher=[[The Observer]]|date=[[2007-02-18]]|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/Critic_Review/Observer_review/0,,2015564,00.html|accessdate=2007-03-05}}</ref> The film also received positive reviews stateside. Derek Elley of ''Variety'' praised Broadbent and Dalton, "[who] are especially good as Angel's hail-fellow-well-met superior and oily No. 1 suspect".<ref>{{cite news | author = Derek Elley | title = Hot Fuzz | publisher = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=[[2007-02-20]]|url = http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117932857.html?categoryid=31&cs=1 | accessdate=2007-02-23}}</ref>  As an homage to the genre, the film was well received by screenwriter [[Shane Black]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Patrick Kolan|title=Interview With Edgar Wright (page 2)|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=[[2007-03-13]]|url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/772/772635p2.html|accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref>

However, the ''[[The Daily Mirror]]'' only gave ''Hot Fuzz'' 2/5, stating that "many of the jokes miss their target" as the film becomes more action-based.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/showbiz/entertainment/movies/tm_headline=hot-fuzz%26method=full%26objectid=18621717%26siteid=89520-name_page.html|title=Hot Fuzz|work=[[Daily Mirror]]}}</ref> ''[[Daily Mail]]'' also shared ''The Mirror'''s view, saying that "It's the lack of any serious intent that means too much of it is desperately unamusing, and unamusingly desperate".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/reviews.html?in_article_id=436569&in_page_id=1924|title=It aims.

The film was met with a wealth of critical praise when it opened in the US on [[April 20]], [[2007]]. Currently, it has a high [[metacritic]] score of 81.<ref>[http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/hotfuzz]</ref>
It made $5.8 million in its opening weekend from only 825 theatres. ''Hot Fuzz'' also had the highest per-theatre average of any film in the top ten that week. Its opening weekend take beat the $3.3 million opening weekend take of Pegg and Wright's previous film, ''Shaun of the Dead''. In its second weekend of release, [[Rogue Pictures]] expanded the film's theatre count from 825 to 1,272 and it grossed $4.9 million, representing a small 17% dip in the gross. As of [[June 23]], [[2007]], ''Hot Fuzz'' has grossed $74,193,041 .<ref>[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=hotfuzz.htm Box Office Mojo: HOT FUZZ]</ref> Not only did it in 9 weeks make nearly twice what ''Shaun of the Dead'' made in the US but it also made more than three times Shaun did in foreign countries.<ref>[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=shaunofthedead.htm Box Office Mojo : SHAUN OF THE DEAD]</ref>

==Cultural references==
Simon Pegg has said that "an awareness of the [[postmodern condition]] is still the intellectual bedrock" of his comedic method.<ref name="Interview">{{cite web|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,2005313,00.html|title=A Fair Cop |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''}}</ref> This is reflected in the large number of references to other films, TV and computer games featured in his work.

The film predominantly references and parodies action films. This is done in a number of ways, including references to scenes — Angel's collecting of guns from the evidence room plays on similar scenes in many action films, including, for example, ''[[Commando (film)|Commando]]'' and ''[[The Matrix (film)|The Matrix]]''.<ref name="Tooling Up">{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/features/hotfuzz/|title=Hot Fuzz Feature|publisher=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]}}</ref> In particular, the films ''[[Bad Boys II]]'' and ''[[Point Break]]'', watched by Angel and Butterman at one point in the film, are frequently referenced. Butterman's firing of his gun in the air in the final action scene is a direct reference to a scene of ''Point Break'' previously viewed by the characters in an earlier scene.<ref name=avclub>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/60806/2|title="Nick Frost, Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright of 'Hot Fuzz'"|publisher=A.V Club}}</ref> In the aftermath as ambulances arrive, a low angle shot of Angel and Butterman matches one from ''Bad Boys'' when police helicopters arrive. The movie poster itself spoofs early promotional material for ''[[Bad Boys II]]''.{{Fact|date=April 2007}} Even the logo is a variation of the one found in the posters for the aforementioned film, and its predecessor, ''[[Bad Boys (1995 film)|Bad Boys]]''.{{or}} Lines such as "This shit just got real", "Punch that shit!", and "[They're] off the fucking chain" also refer to ''Bad Boys II''. 

Other films referenced through individual lines include ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' ("You've always been here"), ''[[Chinatown (film)|Chinatown]]'' ("Forget it, Nick. It's Sandford"), ''[[Men in Black (film)|Men in Black]]'' ("Now that's what I'm talking about") and ''[[He-Man]]'' (the repeated "By the power of [[Castle Grayskull|Grayskull]]"). 

Similarly, the action sequences refer to various police and thriller movies of note.  For example, ''[[Straw Dogs]]'' is referenced when Angel shoots the bear-trap down causing it close on the barkeeper's head, and ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'' and ''[[Goodfellas]]'' are referenced when Frost opens the car trunk and looks down at Pegg.  

Also when Angel is chasing the cloaked murderer between the green houses his running style with his arms at right angles reflects the distinctive style ''[[Robert Patrick]]'' created for the T-1000 in ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day (film)|Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]''.  

There is also a nod to the original ''[[Back to the Future]]'' when Angel is taking a beating from Skinner.  Angel catches his fist with his left hand with a dramatic pause before he lands a retaliating punch with his right fist, just as George McFly did when standing up to lifelong bully Biff Tannen.

Throughout the film, Angel carries a plant with him that he cares for closely and has a near-personal bond with. This is especially prevalent during the scenes where he is moving from London to Sandford, referencing the film ''[[Léon (film)|Léon]]'' (also known as ''The Professional'') where that film's main character also carries and cares for a plant.  

The film also shares similarity in plot and theme with films such as ''Straw Dogs'', ''[[The Wicker Man]]'', ''[[Scream (film)|Scream]]'' and ''[[The Frighteners]]'',{{or}} and twice a character notes that one of the villagers was an extra in ''Straw Dogs''.

[[Image:HotFuzz-Zombies party.jpg|thumb|''Zombies Party'' DVD]]
Multiple nods to ''Shaun of the Dead'' are also made, including the fence-based short cut ("What's the matter Danny? Never taken a short cut before?"), but with a role reversal of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, the one-worded Cornetto requests, the way Angel and Danny describe some suspicious characters on the street, a pub slot machine jingle (Oo-ah-Dracula) heard in The Winchester, the product advertised in the pub; in ''Shaun'', the rifle in The Winchester was thought to be deactivated but was not while in ''Hot Fuzz'', it was thought the sea mine was also deactivated but was not.  Also, when the massive shoot-out is taking place, Danny asks where they should go, to which Angel replies "Pub?" which is also said with the roles reversed in ''Shaun''. In ''Shaun'', Ed (Nick Frost) is said to have shot his sister in the foot with an air-rifle. In ''Hot Fuzz'', Danny shoots Dr Hatcher in the foot twice: the first time, accidentally with an air rifle; the second time, deliberately by 'surrendering' his shotgun.  Most blatantly, the UK DVD — altered to show the Spanish title of ''Zombies Party'' — is briefly seen in a supermarket bargain bin, with a price sticker covering Pegg's face (pictured). In a deleted scene, Frank uses the word exacerbate, then explains what it means, to which Angel replies, "I am aware of the meaning of the word exacerbate". In ''Shaun of the Dead'', Shaun and Ed do not know the meaning, and Liz has to explain it.

There is also a nod to the [[Channel 4]] sitcom ''[[Green Wing]]'' in the car chase sequence, where the characters shout "Swan!!", followed by a close-up of the swan, followed by the car veering off the road. This mirrors the final episodes of both series of ''Green Wing'', where similar incidents occur with a sheep in place of the swan.

Upon entering the village pub for the first time he notices a large number of obviously underage teenagers drinking. when he questions the owner of the pub about this the owner refers to the teenagers as "Younglings" an obvious nod to the name given to young [[Jedi]] in ''[[Star Wars]]''.

The fight sequence in the model village is classic take on Japanese [[B movie]] ''[[Godzilla]]''-type action.

Danny Butterman wears a [[Bristol Rovers F.C.]] shirt in many parts of the film.

There are several in-jokes with regards to police terminology. Some are explained in the film such as "Police Service, you can't call it a force — sounds too aggressive" where modernisation within the police has led to changes. Meanwhile the fictional town of Sandford is the name used by [[Centrex (police training agency)|Centrex]] for their genuine police promotion exercises.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/northwest/series2/police_village_chesire_training_crime_sandford_officers.shtml | title=Cheshire's Police Village | publisher=BBC | work=BBC Inside Out | accessdate=2007-03-09}}</ref>

The Neighbourhood Watch Alliance has the abbreviation [[N.W.A.]], with possible reference to the music group. They are also referenced in the first line of one of the songs in the credits, "straight outta Sandford," referring to N.W.A.'s "[[Straight Outta Compton]]".

In an interview, when asked about the title of ''Hot Fuzz'', Wright called it "pure nonsense".

The shoot-out with Angel and the old members of the Sandford community in the market mimics the end of the film ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]''.

The scenes shown after the arrest of several characters appears to be a parody of ''[[Man on Fire]]'' as the camera shoots from different angles and the music featured is similar to the Trent Reznor music featured throughout that film.

"Sandford" was the name of a fictional village within the [[Bruche Police National Training Centre]] in Cheshire, until closure in May 2006.<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/northwest/series2/police_village_chesire_training_crime_sandford_officers.shtml</ref>

When Nicholas Angel lays his theory in front of the rest of the police, pinning Skinner for the murders, Skinner notes his assistant Tina also works at Flappers. This unintentionally is the same name of the 'gentlemen's club' featured in ''[[The League of Gentlemen]]'' episode "[[The One Armed Man Is King]]" (([[Mark Gatiss]] and [[Reece Shearsmith]] both appearing in ''[[Spaced]]'' and ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'').

==DVD==
The DVD was scheduled for release on [[11 June]] [[2007]] in the UK and [[8 June]] [[2007]] in Ireland. Disc one of the two disc set contains the feature film with four commentaries, outtakes, trailers and TV spots, 'The Man Who Would Be Fuzz', 'Hot Funk', Fuzz-o-meter, storyboards and 'Flick Book: The Other Side'. Disc two contains 22 deleted scenes with optional commentary, a making of documentary, 13 video blogs, featurettes, plot holes and comparisons, special effects feature, galleries and some hidden [[Easter egg (virtual)|easter eggs]]. The DVD will also feature Wright's last amateur film ''Dead Right'' which he described as "Hot Fuzz without the budget". A making of ''Dead Right'' is also included on the second disc. Due to the above release date, the movie arrives on region 2 DVD earlier than the theatrical release date in Germany on 14th June, 2007.<ref>Kino De: [http://www.kino.de/kinofilm/hot-fuzz-zwei-abgewichste-profis/103220.html Hot Fuzz - Zwei abgewichste Profis] {{de_icon}}</ref> 

The U.S. DVD and HD DVD release of Hot Fuzz will be coming out on [[July 31]], [[2007]]. According to the official site so far, the HD DVD edition has more special features than the standard DVD release.
