ISBN 0-8065-1600-3.  As Williams notes, the actual onscreen title has no initial "The".  Some references follow suit and refer to the film as ''Pit and the Pendulum''.</ref> is a [[1961 in film|1961]] [[horror film]] directed by [[Roger Corman]], starring  [[Vincent Price]], [[Barbara Steele]], [[John Kerr (actor)|John Kerr]], and [[Luana Anders]].  The [[screenplay]] by [[Richard Matheson]] was very loosely based on [[Edgar Allan Poe]]’s [[short story]] of the [[The Pit and the Pendulum|same name]].  Set in [[16th Century]] [[Spain]], the story is about a young [[English people|Englishman]] who visits a forbidding castle to investigate his sister's mysterious death. After a series of horrific revelations, apparently [[ghost]]ly appearances and violent deaths, the young man becomes strapped to the titular [[torture device]] by his lunatic brother-in-law during the film's [[climax (narrative)|climactic]] [[sequence (film)|sequence]].      

''The Pit and the Pendulum'' was the second title in the popular [[film series|series]] of Poe-based movies released by  [[American International Pictures]], the first having been Corman’s '' [[House of Usher (film)|House of Usher]]'' released the previous year.  Like ''House'', the film features [[widescreen]] [[cinematography]] by [[Floyd Crosby]], huge sets designed by [[art director]] [[Daniel Haller]], and a [[film score]] composed by [[Les Baxter]].  A critical and box office hit, ''Pit'''s commercial success convinced AIP and Corman to continue [[film adaptation|adapting]] Poe stories for another six films, five of them starring Price.  The series ended in 1965 with the release of ''[[The Tomb of Ligeia]]''.   

[[Film critic]] [[Tim Lucas]] and [[writer]] [[Ernesto Gastaldi]] have both noted the film’s strong influence on numerous subsequent [[Cinema of Italy|Italian]] thrillers, from [[Mario Bava]]’s ''[[The Whip and the Body]]'' (1963) to [[Dario Argento]]’s '' [[Deep Red]] '' (1975).<ref name="Lucas">Lucas, Tim.

==Synopsis==
In Spain, during the 16th Century, Francis Barnard ([[John Kerr (actor)|John Kerr]]) visits the castle of his brother-in-law Nicholas Medina ([[Vincent Price]]) to investigate the cause of the mysterious death of his sister, Elizabeth ([[Barbara Steele]]).  Both Nicholas and his younger sister, Catherine ([[Luana Anders]]), offer a vague explanation about Elizabeth having died from a rare [[hematology|blood disorder]].  However, when Nicholas responds evasively after Francis asks for specific details regarding the disease, Francis advises that he will not leave until he discovers the true reason his sister died.  

During dinner with family physician Dr. Leon ([[Antony Carbone]]), Francis again asks about his sister's death.  Dr. Leon tells him that his sister had died of massive [[heart failure]], literally "dying of fright".  Francis demands to be shown where Elizabeth died.  Nicholas takes him to the castle's [[torture chamber]].  Nicholas reveals that Elizabeth, under the influence of the castle's "heavy atmosphere",  became obsessed with the chamber's torture devices.  After becoming progressively unbalanced, one day she locked herself into an [[Iron maiden (torture device)|iron maiden]], and died after whispering the name "Sebastian."  Francis refuses to believe Nicholas's story.  

Francis tells Catherine that Nicholas appears to feel "definite guilt" regarding Elizabeth’s death.  In response, Catherine talks about Nicholas's [[psychological trauma|traumatic childhood]], revealing that their father was Sebastian Medina, a notorious member of the [[Spanish Inquisition]].  When Nicholas was a small child, he was playing in the castle's torture chamber when his father (also played by Price) entered the room with his mother, Isabella, and Sebastian’s brother, Bartolome.  Hiding in a corner, Nicholas watched in horror as his father repeatedly hit Bartolome with a red-hot [[fireplace poker|poker]], screaming “Adulterer!” at him.  After murdering Bartolome, Sebastian began torturing his wife slowly to death in front of Nicholas’s eyes. 

After Catherine is finished telling Francis about Nicholas, Catherine and Francis are informed by Dr. Leon that Isabella was in fact not tortured to death, rather she was entombed behind a brick wall while still alive.  Dr. Leon explains, “The very thought of [[premature burial|premature interment]] is enough to send your brother into convulsions of horror.”  Nicholas believes that Elizabeth may have been interred prematurely.  The doctor tells Nicholas that "if Elizabeth Medina walks these corridors, it is her [[spirit]] and not her living self."

Nicholas now believes his late wife’s vengeful [[ghost]] is haunting the castle.  Elizabeth’s room is noisily ransacked and her portrait is found slashed to ribbons.  Her beloved [[harpsichord]] plays in the middle of the night.  One of Elizabeth's rings is found in the keyboard.  Francis accuses Nicholas of planting the evidence of Elizabeth’s  “haunting” as some sort of elaborate [[hoax]].  Nicholas insists that his wife’s tomb be opened.  Inside the coffin, they discover Elizabeth’s [[decomposition|putrefied]] corpse frozen in a position of writhing horror, hands clawed and mouth wide open, as if in a final scream. 
[[Image:PitCap.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Vincent Price as Nicholas Medina, gone completely mad]]
That night, Nicholas, now on the very edge of sanity, hears his wife calling him.  He follows her ghostly voice down to the torture chamber.  Suddenly, Elizabeth appears from out of the shadows, causing Nicholas to fall down a flight of stairs.  She is alive, and she is met by her lover, Dr. Leon.  Elizabeth, thinking Nicholas dead, taunts his apparent corpse about their scheme to drive him mad so the two lovers could inherit his fortune and estate.   Nicholas opens his eyes and begins laughing while his wife and the doctor recoil in horror. Nicholas stands up and overpowers Dr. Leon, who attempts to escape but falls to his death.  Nicholas then approaches Elizabeth, and promises he will torture her horribly.  Francis, having heard Elizabeth's screams, enters the dungeon to see what has happened.  Nicholas is now gibbering with insanity and has become convinced he is his own father, the evil Sebastian Medina.  He confuses Francis for Sebastian's brother, Bartolome, and knocks him unconscious.  He straps him to a stone slab located directly beneath a huge razor-sharp pendulum.  The cackling Nicholas slowly lowers the swinging blade closer and closer to Francis’s torso.  Catherine arrives just in time with Maximillian, one of the family [[domestic worker|servants]].  After a brief fight with Maximillian, Nicholas falls to his death, and Francis is removed from the torture device.  As they leave the basement, Catherine vows to seal up the chamber forever.  They slam and lock the door shut, unaware that Elizabeth is still alive, [[gag]]ged and trapped in the iron maiden.

==Production==
When Roger Corman's ''House of Usher'' was released in June of 1960, its  box office success took AIP’s James H. Nicholson and Samuel Z. Arkoff by surprise. Corman admitted, “We anticipated that the movie would do well, but not half as well as it did.” According to Richard Matheson, “When the first film was a hit, they still didn’t consider doing a Poe series. They just wanted another movie with a Poe title fixed to it.”<ref name="Naha">Naha, Ed.  ''The Films of Roger Corman:  Brilliance on a Budget'', Arco Publishing, Inc., 1982. ISBN 0-668-05308-9</ref>  ''The Pit and the Pendulum'' was announced in August 1960, and filming began the first week of January 1961.  According to Lucy Chase Williams's book, ''The Complete Films of Vincent Price'', the shooting schedule was fifteen days, and the film’s budget was almost $1 million.<ref name="Williams">Williams, Lucy Chase.  ''The Complete Films of Vincent Price'', Citadel Press, 1995. ISBN 0-8065-1600-3</ref> Corman himself has said that the film's actual production cost was approximately $300,000.<ref name="McGee2">McGee, Mark Thomas.

''Horror Film Directors, 1931-1990'', McFarland & Company, Inc., 1991. ISBN 0-89950-609-7</ref> 

===Screenplay===
Matheson's script freely devised an elaborate [[narrative]] that barely resembled Poe, with only the finale having any similarity at all to the original short story on which the film was based.  Corman noted, "The method we adopted on ''The Pit and the Pendulum'' was to use the Poe short story as the climax for a third [[act (theater)|act]] to the motion picture, because a two-page short story is not about to give you a ninety-minute motion picture.  We then constructed the first two acts in what we hoped was a manner faithful to Poe, as his climax would run only a short time on the screen."<ref name="Di Franco">Di Franco, J. Philip (editor).  ''The Movie World of Roger Corman'', Chelsea House Publishers, 1979. ISBN 0-87754-122-1</ref>

Matheson's screenplay included a [[flashback]] to a time immediately preceding Elizabeth's illness, featuring Nicholas and Elizabeth horseback riding and eating a picnic lunch.  Corman deleted the sequence prior to filming because he felt it violated one of his major theories regarding the Poe series: "I had a lot of theories I was working with when I did the Poe films...One of my theories was that these stories were created out of the [[unconscious mind]] of Poe and the unconscious mind never really sees reality, so until ''[[The Tomb of Ligeia]]'' we never showed the real world...In ''Pit'', John Kerr arrived in a carriage against an ocean background, which I felt was more representative of the unconscious. That horseback interlude was thrown out because I didn't want to have a scene with people out in broad daylight."<ref name="Williams">Williams, Lucy Chase.  ''The Complete Films of Vincent Price'', Citadel Press, 1995. ISBN 0-8065-1600-3</ref>

The screenplay was modified from its original draft form during the film's shooting.  Price himself suggested numerous dialogue changes for his character.  In the script, when Francis Barnard is first introduced to Nicholas, the young man asks about loud, strange noises he had heard a few moments earlier.  Don Medina responds:  "Uh...an apparatus, Mr. Barnard. (''turning'') What brings you to us?"  Price penciled in the suggestions "that must be kept in constant repair" and "that cannot be stopped".  Later in the screenplay, when Nicholas recalls his father's chamber of torture, Price devised alternate explanations for Sebastian Medina's violence.  During Nicholas's death scene, after falling to the bottom of the pit the character originally had dialogue at the point of dying, asking in a voice of horror, "Elizabeth.  What have I done to you?  (''beat'')  What have I done to you?"  The camera was to then [[Cut (film)|cut]] directly to Elizabeth's face trapped in the iron maiden.  Corman decided to jettison the lines, believing that the film should remain purely visual at that point and dialogue would ruin the power of the scene.<ref name="Williams">Williams, Lucy Chase.  ''The Complete Films of Vincent Price'', Citadel Press, 1995. ISBN 0-8065-1600-3</ref>

===Filming===
Corman has noted that making the film was a pleasurable experience: "I enjoyed ''The Pit and the Pendulum'' because I actually got the chance to experiment a bit with the movement of the camera.  There was a lot of moving camera work and interesting [[film editing|cutting]] in the climax of the film."<ref name="Naha">Naha, Ed.  ''The Films of Roger Corman:  Brilliance on a Budget'', Arco Publishing, Inc., 1982. ISBN 0-668-05308-9</ref>  Filming went smoothly, and Corman attributed the ease of the production's shoot to the short but comprehensive [[pre-production]] planning he did with the major technicians. "We achieved what we did on a low budget because we carefully planned the whole production in advance of starting the cameras.  Thus, when we moved into the studio for fifteen days of scheduled shooting, we didn't have to start making decisions. Because of our pre-production conferences with [[Cinematographer|Director of Photography]] Floyd Crosby and Art Director Daniel Haller, everyone knew exactly what to do, barring any last minute inspirations on the set."<ref name="Lightman">Lightman, Herb A.  "The Pit and the Pendulum:   A Study In Horror Film Photography", ''[[American Cinematographer]]'', October 1961 issue.</ref>

[[Image:PitFlash.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Barbara Steele as Elizabeth Medina, in one of the film's tinted, nightmarish flashback sequences]]
To create the flashbacks revealing Nicholas's [[Psychological trauma|traumatic experiences]],  Corman and Crosby attempted to shoot them in a manner that would convey to the audience the character's horror in dredging up nightmares trapped  in his [[unconscious mind|subconscious]]. Corman insisted on these images having a [[dream|dream-like]] quality, "twisted and distorted because they were being experienced by someone on the rim of madness".  Corman decided to film the flashbacks in [[monochrome]], since he had read that some psychiatrists believe most people dream in "black-and white" imagery.  Crosby used [[wide-angle lens]]es,<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055304/technical Technical Specifications for Pit and the Pendulum] from the ''Internet Movie Database''. Crosby shot the film using the [[35 mm|35&nbsp;mm]] [[anamorphic]] film process with [[Panavision]] cameras and lenses.</ref> violent camera movement, and tilted [[camera angle]]s to represent the character's feeling of hysteria. The sequences were then printed on [[film tinting|blue-tinted]] [[film stock|stock]] which was subsequently toned red during [[photographic processing|development]], effectively producing a [[wikt:two-tone|two-tone]] image. The highlights were blue, with the shadows rendered as red, producing a deep, bloody quality. The image was then run through an [[optical printer]] where the edges were [[vignetting|vignetted]] and a twisted linear distortion was introduced.<ref name="Lightman">Lightman, Herb A.  "The Pit and the Pendulum: A Study In Horror Film Photography", ''[[American Cinematographer]]'', October 1961 issue.</ref>

===Art direction===
The film's brief exterior [[prologue]] showing Kerr's arrival to the castle was filmed on the [[Palos Verdes]] coast.  The rest of the production was shot in four interior [[sound stage]]s at the California Studios in [[Hollywood]].  To provide great freedom for  the planned camera movements, a castle set with many levels and ample space was designed by  Daniel Haller.  Because of the film's low budget, none of the sets could be constructed "from scratch".  After Haller made sketches and floor plans for the sets, he searched the [[backlot]]s and property lofts of the major studios in search of available set units that could be inexpensively rented and then put together to form the sets he had conceived. At [[Universal Studios]], he located numerous discarded pieces from old productions, including massive archways, fireplaces, windows and doorways, and several torture machine props.  At other studios, he found gigantic stairways and stone wall units. Haller selected and rented numerous pieces from these various depositories and had them delivered to California Studios, where the sets for the film were constructed, following his floor plans as closely as possible.<ref name="Lightman">Lightman, Herb A.  "The Pit and the Pendulum:   A Study In Horror Film Photography", ''[[American Cinematographer]]'', October 1961 issue.</ref>  To further set the atmosphere, about 20 gallons of cobwebbing was sprayed throughout the castle's sets.<ref>Smith, Don G. ''The Poe Cinema: A Critical Filmography''. McFarland & Company, 1999. p. 117 ISBN 078641703X</ref>

The film’s [[pressbook]] noted that the pendulum was eighteen feet long and weighed over a ton, and was constructed with a realistic rubber cutting blade.  The pendulum was rigged from the top of the sound stage  thirty-five feet in the air.<ref name="McGee">McGee, Mark Thomas.  ''Roger Corman: The Best of the Cheap Acts'', McFarland & Company, Inc., 1988. ISBN 0-89950-330-6</ref> In an interview, Haller provided details regarding the creation of the pendulum:
:"I found that such a pendulum actually was used during the Spanish and German inquisitions.  At first we tried to use a rubberized blade and that's why it got stuck on Kerr's chest.  We then switched to a sharp metalized blade covered with steel paint.  The problem was to get it in exactly the right position so it would slash John's shirt without actually cutting him.  To guard against this we put a steel band around his waist where the pendulum crosses.  He was a good sport about it but noticed him perspiring a good bit and no wonder.  That pendulum was carving out a 50 foot arc just above his body.”<ref name="McGee2">McGee, Mark Thomas.  ''Faster and Furiouser:  The Revised and Fattened Fable of American International Pictures'', McFarland & Company, Inc., 1996. ISBN 0-7864-0137-0</ref>

To visually enhance the size of this set, the camera was equipped with a 40&nbsp;mm Panavision wide-angle lens and mounted at the opposite end of the stage, giving Crosby the ability to frame the scenes in his camera with extra space at the bottom and at either side. These areas were filled in later by printing-in [[matte painting|process extensions]] of the set, doubling its size onscreen.<ref name="Lightman">Lightman, Herb A.  "The Pit and the Pendulum:   A Study In Horror Film Photography", ''[[American Cinematographer]]'', October 1961 issue.</ref>

===Cast===
*'''[[Vincent Price]]''' as '''Nicholas/Sebastian Medina'''.  This was Price's third film for American International Pictures and his second for director Corman.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/filmography.html?p_id=57806&mod=films|title=Vincent Price Filmography|accessdate=2007-03-22|first=|last=|publisher=New York Times.com}}</ref> In response to the profitability of ''House of Usher'', Price "upped his asking price for ''Pit'' to $125,000, plus a percentage of the profits."<ref name="Fischer">Fischer, Dennis.  ''Horror Film Directors, 1931-1990'', McFarland & Company, Inc., 1991. ISBN 0-89950-609-7</ref>  Most critics seemed to enjoy Price's somewhat [[overacting|hammy]] performance as the tormented, guilt-ridden victim of his "late" wife's evil machinations. Darrell Moore wrote that "Vincent Price returns to his usual overacting, ego-tripping self in ''The Pit and the Pendulum''.  His wonderfully maniacal performance is the high point of the film."<ref name="Moore">Moore, Darrell.  ''The Best, Worst, and Most Unusual Horror Films'', Beekman House, 1983. ISBN 0-517-40266-8</ref> And Nathaniel Thompson noted that "Vincent Price has a field day alternating from gibbering terror to teeth-gnashing insanity (sometimes in the same scene)..."<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.mondo-digital.com/talesofterror.html |title=Pit and the Pendulum|accessdate=2007-07-08|first=Nathaniel|last=Thompson|publisher=Mondo  Digital.com}}</ref> Some, however,  thought his acting overly theatrical and damaging to the film's mood.  Writer Ken Hanke felt the film had "...a few unintended laughs thanks to Vinnie's [[camp (style)|campiness]]."<ref name="Hanke">Hanke, Ken.  ''Mountain Xpress'' (Asheville, NC), unknown date (quoted on Rotten Tomatoes.com)</ref>  

*'''[[Barbara Steele]]''' as '''Elizabeth'''.  This was Steele's first film since her break-through horror performance in [[Mario Bava]]'s ''[[Black Sunday (1960 film)|Black Sunday]]'' (1960).  The actress recalled that she was “in awe” of Price during the production and described the filming of their final scene together as surprisingly physical: “Our major confrontation where he  strangles me was done in one take…He really went at me and I had the bruises on my throat to prove it.  Afterward, he was so concerned he had hurt me – a perfect gentleman –a truly kind figure in spite of his image.”<ref name="Biordowski2">Biordowski, Steve, Del Valle, David and French, Lawrence.

*'''[[John Kerr (actor)|John Kerr]]''' as '''Francis Barnard'''.  The [[Tony Award]]-winning actor (for ''[[Tea and Sympathy]]'' (1955)) had been a once-promising leading man in the 1950s, featured in major roles in the theatrical film versions of ''Tea and Sympathy'' (1956) and [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s ''[[South Pacific (1958 film)|South Pacific]]'' (1958). His role as the nominal hero in ''Pit'' would prove to be the last notable film appearance of his career.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/filmography.html?p_id=37908 |title=John Kerr|accessdate=2007-01-08|first=Hal|last=Erickson|publisher=New York Times.com}}</ref>   Years later, Kerr expressed surprise that ''Pit'' seemed to be his best remembered role, "If you had told me years ago that ''Pit and the Pendulum'' would be The One out of all the stuff I've done, if you had told me that this would be the cult-type movie that people would be collecting memorabilia on, I would have said, 'You're out of your gourd.'

*'''[[Luana Anders]]''' as '''Catherine Medina'''.  Anders's role as Price's (much younger) sister was one of several appearances she made in AIP productions.  Most of these films were directed by Corman.  The actress had first met Corman several years previously while both were attending acting classes taught by [[Jeff Corey]] in Los Angeles.  After ''Pit'', Anders would make two further films with Corman as a director, ''The Young Racers'' (1963) and ''[[The Trip (1967 film)|The Trip]]'' (1967).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/filmography.html?p_id=79590 |title=Luana Anders|accessdate=2007-01-14|first=Hal|last=Erickson|publisher=New York Times.com}}</ref>     

*'''[[Antony Carbone]]''' as '''Doctor Leon'''.  Like Anders, Carbone was a brief member of Corman's early-1960s "[[Stock company (acting)|stock company]]" of actors, appearing in four of the director's films during that time.  Carbone's only starring role in his career had been in Corman's ''[[Creature from the Haunted Sea]]'' (1960), which co-starred writer [[Robert Towne]].  ''Pit'' was Carbone's final appearance in a Corman-directed movie.<ref name="McGee">McGee, Mark Thomas.  ''Roger Corman: The Best of the Cheap Acts'', McFarland & Company, Inc., 1988.

ISBN 978-0824089764</ref>

Prior to the start of filming, Corman had set aside one day of [[rehearsal]]s with his cast.  "Previously, I had painstakingly rehearsed the actors so there was complete understanding as to what each was to accomplish in each scene. This is most important; there is nothing worse than to be on the set and ready to roll, only to find that director and actor have different views as to how the scene is to be done. Thanks to pre-production planning and rehearsals, there was no time wasted on the set in haggling and making decisions."<ref name="Lightman">Lightman, Herb A.

==Response==
''The Pit and the Pendulum'' was a bigger hit than ''House of Usher'', accruing over [[US$]] 2,000,000 in [[film distributor|distributors']] domestic (U.S. and Canada) rentals versus the first film's US$ 1,450,000.<ref name="Gebert">Gebert, Michael.

ISBN 0-668-05308-9</ref> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' described it as "...a class suspense-horror film of the calibre of the excellent ones done by [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer]]...It is carefully made and has full production values...Vincent Price gives a characteristically [[rococo]] performance..."<ref name="Williams">Williams, Lucy Chase.  ''The Complete Films of Vincent Price'', Citadel Press, 1995.

But Charles Stinson of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' was notably unimpressed by the film: “The uncredited [''sic''] scenario violates Poe’s gothic style with passages of flat, modernized dialogue…But the [[peccadillo]]es of the script pale beside the acting…Price mugs, rolls his eyes continuously and delivers his lines in such an unctuous tone that he comes near to [[burlesque|burlesquing]] the role.  His mad scenes are just ludicrous.  The audience almost died laughing.”<ref name="Stinson">Stinson, Charles.  Review from the ''Los Angeles Times'' quoted in ''The Complete Films of Vincent Price'', Citadel Press, 1995. ISBN 0-8065-1600-3</ref> Price was so infuriated by Stinson’s negative review that he wrote a letter to the critic, saying “I find I must break a 25 year determination never to answer a critic.  Since your review of ''The Pit and the Pendulum'' was obviously not meant to be instructive, and therefore constructive, but only to hurt and humiliate, I’m sure you would enjoy the satisfaction of knowing that it did. My only consolation…is that it is the second greatest box office attraction in the country.” Price apparently never sent the letter, placing it instead into his “Letting Off Steam File”.<ref name="Williams">Williams, Lucy Chase.

The film’s critical reputation has continued to grow over the years and it is now generally held to be one of the best entries in Corman's Poe series.  In ''[[The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural]]'', Timothy Sullivan wrote, “''The Pit and the Pendulum'' is even better than its predecessor…The plot is heady stuff, and Roger Corman drives it forward with wonderful [[matte painting|matte shots]] of the castle perched on the seaside cliff, odd camera angles, the thickest cobwebs in horror movie history, a spider in the face, and an iron maiden…all before our hero is strapped under the pendulum, in a sequence that still stands one’s hair on end.”<ref name="Sullivan">Sullivan, Timothy.

''House of Usher'' seemed unsure of how to cope with the rush of action as Madeline returned from the grave; ''The Pit and the Pendulum'' has no such hesitations.  From the great sequence in which Steele lures Price down into the crypt to the finale…its action is terrific.”<ref name="Hardy">Hardy, Phil (editor).

Recent critical opinion of the film is not all positive.  Of the 12 reviews included in a [[Rotten Tomatoes]] survey of critics regarding the title, 25% reflect negative reactions.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1016369-pit_and_the_pendulum/?critic=columns |title=''The Pit and the Pendulum'' (1961)|accessdate=2007-01-08|first=|last=|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes}}</ref>  FilmCritic.com opines that the film "...is quite a disappointment...In the end, it feels like one of [Corman's] rush jobs, which of course, it was."<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/ddb5490109a79f598625623d0015f1e4/b7ce090e0846cabe88256a5a007a3fa7?OpenDocument |title=''The Pit and the Pendulum''|accessdate=2007-01-08|first=Christopher|last=Null|publisher=FilmCritic.com}}</ref>

==Influence==
The critical and popular success of ''The Pit and the Pendulum'' persuaded AIP's Arkoff and Nicholson to produce more Edgar Allan Poe-based horror films on a regular basis.<ref name="Corman">Corman, Roger.  Interviewed by David Del Valle in ''[[Video Watchdog]]'' Magazine, issue #24 (August 1994), pgs. 32 - 47, "Ms. Found on a Cassette: Roger Corman on his AIP Poe Films"</ref>   The films that followed, all directed by Corman, were ''The Premature Burial'' (1962),  ''[[Tales of Terror (1962 film)|Tales of Terror]]'' (1962), ''[[The Raven (1963 film)|The Raven]]'' (1963), ''[[The Haunted Palace]]'' (1963, actually based on a story by [[H. P. Lovecraft]]), ''[[The Masque of the Red Death (film)|The Masque of the Red Death]]'' (1964), and'' [[The Tomb of Ligeia]]'' (1965).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/filmography.html?p_id=85920&mod=films |title=Roger Corman filmography|accessdate=2007-03-11|first=|last=|publisher=New York Times.com}}</ref>   

Tim Lucas has argued that the film had a large impact on many [[Cinema of Italy|Italian]] horror films that followed.  Lucas noted, "It takes Corman's [[Freudian]] theories even further with a nightmarish flashblack sequence that plants the seeds of Nicholas' breakdown, and would prove particularly influential on the future course of Italian horror — an influence that can be seen even in productions of the 1970s (''[[Deep Red]]'') and 1980s (''A Blade in the Dark'')."<ref name="Lucas">Lucas, Tim.  ''[[Video Watchdog]]'' Magazine, issue #74, pg. 55.  Review of ''The Pit and the Pendulum'' DVD </ref>  Writer K. Lindbergs has noted an "obvious influence" on [[Antonio Margheriti]]'s ''[[Danza macabra|Castle of Blood]]'' (1964) and its [[remake]], ''Web of the Spider'' (1970).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cinebeats.blogsome.com/2006/05/06/|title=The Ghosts of Antonio Margheriti|accessdate=2007-01-08|first=K|last=Lindbergs|publisher=Cinebeats}}</ref>     
Screenwriter [[Ernesto Gastaldi]] acknowledged that Ugo Guerra and Elio Scardamaglia, the producers of [[Mario Bava]]'s ''[[The Whip and the Body]]'' (1963), had "shown me an Italian print of ''The Pit and the Pendulum'' before I started writing it:  'Give us something like this', they said."  When asked if another of his films, ''The Long Hair of Death'' (1964), was inspired by Corman's film, Gastaldi replied: "Yes, of course!  ''The Pit and the Pendulum'' had a big influence on Italian horror films.  Everybody borrowed from it."<ref name="Gastaldi">Gastaldi, Ernesto.  Interviewed by Tim Lucas in ''Video Watchdog'' Magazine, issue #39, pgs. 28 - 53, "What Are Those Strange Drops of Blood in the Scripts of Ernesto Gastaldi?"</ref>

[[Stephen King]] felt that one of the film's most powerful shocks — the discovery of Elizabeth's hideously decayed corpse — had a major impact on the genre and served as one of the most significant horror sequences of the decade.  King wrote, "Following the Hammer films, this becomes, I think, the most important moment in the post-1960 horror film, signaling a return to an all-out effort to terrify the audience...and a willingness to use any means at hand to do it."<ref name="King">King, Stephen.

==Padded television version==
[[Image:Movie DVD cover pit and the pendulum.jpg|thumb|right|85px|MGM's  "Midnite Movies" DVD included the 1968 "prologue" as a bonus feature]]
In 1968, when the film was sold to [[ABC-TV]] for television airings, the network noted that the film was too short to fill the desired two-hour time slot.  They requested that AIP [[filler|pad]] the film out.  Approximately five minutes of additional footage were subsequently shot by Corman’s [[production assistant]] [[Tamara Asseyev]].<ref name="Williams">Williams, Lucy Chase.

Of the original cast members, only Luana Anders was available at the time, and the new sequence featured her character, Catherine Medina, confined to a [[Psychiatric hospital|lunatic asylum]].  After much screaming and hair pulling, Catherine reveals the details of her horrific story to her fellow inmates, at which point the film itself follows as a flashback.<ref name="Williams">Williams, Lucy Chase.  ''The Complete Films of Vincent Price'', Citadel Press, 1995.
