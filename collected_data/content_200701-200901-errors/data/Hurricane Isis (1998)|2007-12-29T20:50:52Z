'''Hurricane Isis''' was the deadliest [[tropical cyclone]] and only [[Pacific hurricane|hurricane]] to make landfall during the [[1998 Pacific hurricane season]]. The ninth tropical storm and sixth hurricane of the season, Isis developed on [[September 1]] out of the interaction between a [[tropical wave]] and a large low-level circulation to the southwest of [[Mexico]]. It moved northward, striking the extreme southeastern portion of the [[Baja California Peninsula]] before attaining hurricane status in the [[Gulf of California]]. Isis made landfall at [[Topolobampo]] in the state of [[Sinaloa]] on [[September 3]] and quickly lost its low-level circulation. The remnants persisted for several days before dissipating in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Idaho]].

In Mexico, Isis destroyed over 700&nbsp;houses and killed 14&nbsp;people, primarily due to its heavy rainfall which peaked at over 20&nbsp;inches (500&nbsp;mm) in southern [[Baja California Sur]]. The rainfall caused widespread damage to roads and railways, stranding thousands of people. Moisture from the remnants of Isis extended into the southwestern [[United States]], resulting in light rainfall, dozens of traffic accidents, and power outages to thousands of residents in [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]].

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Isis 1998 track.png}}
A [[tropical wave]] moved off the coast of [[Africa]] on [[August 14]]. It traveled westward, and on [[August 19]] developed into the tropical depression which eventually became [[Hurricane Bonnie (1998)|Hurricane Bonnie]].<ref name="bonnietcr">{{cite web|author=Lixion Avila|year=1998|title=Hurricane Bonnie Preliminary Report|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-02-07|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1998bonnie.html}}</ref> The wave axis continued westward across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and [[Caribbean Sea]], and crossed [[Central America]] into the eastern [[Pacific Ocean]] on [[August 25]]. The wave decreased its forward speed while approaching a large low-level circulation over southern [[Mexico]]. A broad area of disturbed weather formed in association with the wave and the low-level circulation, and after persisting for several days developed a smaller low-level circulation on [[August 29]] about 575&nbsp;miles (925&nbsp;km) south-southeast of [[Cabo San Lucas]]. On [[August 31]], the two primary areas of convection were well-removed from the center, and by early on [[September 1]], even though deep convection was still not well-organized, the low-cloud circulation was sufficiently well-defined that the [[National Hurricane Center]] designated it as Tropical Depression Ten-E while centered slightly less than 350&nbsp;miles (565&nbsp;km) south of Cabo San Lucas.<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=Richard J.

The depression initially tracked slowly north-northwestward and gradually strengthened. Late on [[September 1]] it intensified into Tropical Storm Isis while located about 200&nbsp;miles (320&nbsp;km) south of Cabo San Lucas.<ref name="tcr"/> Upon becoming a tropical storm, the deep convection was not organized, with one forecaster describing Isis as a large [[monsoon]]-like system.<ref name="disc1"/> A mid-level [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] extending southward from the [[Arizona]]/[[California]] border resulted in the storm to accelerate northward. The storm quickly strengthened; six hours after Isis became a tropical storm it reached winds of 70&nbsp;mph (115&nbsp;km/h).<ref name="tcr"/> Very deep, symmetrical convection developed over the poorly-defined center of circulation while [[rainband|banding features]] began to form, though ill-defined [[outflow (meteorology)|outflow]] and land interaction with the [[Baja California Peninsula]] initially prevented further strengthening.<ref name="disc3">{{cite web|author=Guiney|year=1998|title=Tropical Storm Isis Discussion Three|accessdate=2007-02-08|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/dis/NEP1098.003}}</ref> At 1200 [[UTC]] on [[September 2]], Isis made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] on extreme southeastern [[Baja California Sur]] as a strong tropical storm, and subsequently turned to the north-northeast.<ref name="tcr"/>

After entering the [[Gulf of California]], an [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] began to become apparent on visible satellite imagery, and it is estimated Isis attained hurricane status late on September 2. It maintained its intensity as it continued northward, and struck [[Topolobampo]] in the state of [[Sinaloa]] early on [[September 3]] as a minimal hurricane. Isis weakened to a tropical storm a few hours after landfall, and subsequent to turning to the north-northwest the low-level circulation dissipated over [[Sierra Madre Occidental]].<ref name="tcr"/> The remnants entered southern [[Arizona]] on [[September 4]] and tracked around an upper-level low. After entering [[Nevada]] on [[September 5]], the remnants of Isis passed into [[Oregon]] before dissipating in [[Idaho]] on [[September 8]].<ref name="rain">{{cite web|author=David Roth|year=2003|title=Rainfall Summary for Hurricane Isis|publisher=Hydrometeorological Prediction Center|accessdate=2007-02-08|url=http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/rain/isis1998.html}}</ref>

==Preparations==
Coinciding with the issuance of the first advisory on Isis, the government of [[Mexico]] issued a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|tropical storm warning]] from [[Dolores, Baja California Sur|Dolores]] to [[Puerto Cortez, Baja California Sur|Puerto Cortex]] along the [[Baja California Peninsula]]. Early on [[September 2]], the warning was extended from [[Santa Rosalía, Baja California Sur|Santa Rosalía]] to [[Punta Abreojos, Baja California Sur|Punta Abreojos]], while an additional tropical storm warning was issued from [[El Dorado, Sinaloa|El Dorado]] to [[Guaymas]]. After Isis became a hurricane, officials issued a hurricane warning from [[Dolores, Baja California Sur|Dolores]] to [[Punta San Gabriel, Baja California Sur|Punta San Gabriel]] on the Baja California Peninsula and from El Dorado to [[Bahía Kino]] on the mainland.<ref name="tcr"/>

2,500&nbsp;residents in [[Baja California Sur]] were evacuated to emergency shelters. Officials closed the port at [[Mazatlán]] and recommended fisherman along the coast of the [[Gulf of California]] to remain at port.<ref name="cnn">{{cite web|author=CNN.com|year=1998|title=Hurricane Isis heads toward Mexican mainland|accessdate=2007-02-08|url=http://www.cnn.com/WEATHER/9809/03/isis.01/index.html}}</ref> Officials set up 49&nbsp;shelters on the mainland to provide evacuees with food, clothing and medical attention.<ref name="ap93">{{cite news|author=Mark Stevenson|date=1998-09-03|title=Isis blasts Mexican mainland before weakening|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=2007-02-08}}</ref> The Mexican Army assisted residents in evacuation, while the Mexican Navy provided medical aid and assistance to boat owners.

[[Image:Isis1998filledrainblk.gif|right|thumb|250px|Rainfall Summary for Hurricane Isis]]
Isis first affected [[Baja California Sur]] on [[September 2]] as a tropical storm. Shortly after making landfall, a weather reporting station at [[San José del Cabo]] recorded sustained winds of 26&nbsp;mph (42&nbsp;km/h), with gusts reaching up to 46&nbsp;mph (74&nbsp;km/h). A station on the [[Islas Marías]] also reported sustained winds of 54&nbsp;mph (87&nbsp;km/h).<ref name="tcr"/> The winds left widespread areas without power or telephone.<ref name="cnn"/> The storm produced heavy rainfall in the southern portion of the peninsula, including a 24&ndash;hour total of 12.99&nbsp;inches (330&nbsp;mm) at [[Los Cabos]]<ref name="tcr"/> and a peak rainfall total of 24.02&nbsp;inches (610&nbsp;mm) at [[Santiago, Baja California Sur|Santiago]].<ref name="rain"/> A married couple were killed after attempting to cross a flooded stream in Los Cabos.<ref name="cnn"/><ref name="ap9055">{{cite news|author=Associated Press|date=1998-09-05|title=At least 10 dead from Hurricane Isis|accessdate=2007-02-08}}</ref> Initially, reports indicated a family was missing in [[La Paz, Baja California Sur|La Paz]], though they were later proven false.<ref name="cnn"/> Flooding from the storm closed all roads to the north of Los Cabos and caused damage to the roads in the area.

Throughout Mexico, the passage of Hurricane Isis resulted in 14&nbsp;deaths and the loss of 769&nbsp;homes,<ref name="tcr"/> with property damage estimates totaling over $5&nbsp;million (1998&nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD]], 50&nbsp;million 1998&nbsp;[[MXN]], $6.2&nbsp;million 2006&nbsp;USD).<ref name="segob">{{cite web|author=Centro Nacional para la Prevención de Desastres|language=Spanish|year=2000|title=Estadísticas Sobre los Riesgos a Atenuar de Fenómenos Perturbadores|accessdate=2007-02-09|url=http://www.cofemermir.gob.mx/uploadtests/4054.66.59.1.STAD%C3%8DSTICAS-RIESGOS-ATENUAR.DOC}}</ref> According to a speech by [[President of Mexico|President]] [[Ernesto Zedillo]], Isis damaged the water systems in 173&nbsp;[[Municipalities of Mexico|localities]]; it also damaged 154&nbsp;primary schools and 9&nbsp;high schools, minorly in most cases, causing the schools to be closed for around a week. 730&nbsp;miles (1175&nbsp;km) of railroad track were damaged by mudslides or flooding, with one bridge entirely destroyed and another four damaged.<ref name="gob"/>

===United States===
Thunderstorms from the remnants of Isis dropped more than 2&nbsp;inches (50&nbsp;mm) of rainfall across southern [[Arizona]], resulting in some flash flood warnings and flooding on roadways.<ref name="ap905">{{cite news|author=Associated Press|date=1998=09-05|title=Isis fizzles but makes for a wet Arizona weekend|accessdate=2007-02-08}}</ref> The heaviest rainfall fell across the [[Santa Catalina Mountains|Santa Catalina]] and [[Rincon Mountains]] near [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]], which saw precipitation amounts of up to 3&nbsp;inches (75&nbsp;mm). Otherwise, no flooding was reported in the Tucson area, with the [[Tucson International Airport]] reporting only 1.1&nbsp;inches (28&nbsp;mm) as a result of the storm.<ref name="arinws">{{cite web|author=Glueck|year=1998|title=September 1998 climate report for Tucson|publisher=Tucson, Arizona National Weather Service|accessdate=2007-02-08|url=http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/twc/climate/monthly/sep98.php}}</ref>

The moisture extended into southern [[California]] and produced moderate precipitation across the region. [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]] reported a one-day rainfall record on September 4 with 0.23&nbsp;inches (5.8&nbsp;mm) of precipitation, breaking the previous record of 0.17&nbsp;inches (4.3&nbsp;mm) set in [[1963]]. Rainfall amounts at [[Frazier Park, California|Frazier Park]] peaked at 1.53&nbsp;inches (39&nbsp;m). Agricultural losses, primarily from [[Winemaking|vintners]] and raisin growers, rose up to $5&nbsp;million in damage (1998&nbsp;USD, $6.12&nbsp;million 2006&nbsp;USD), either directly due to rain or indirectly due to the additional steps to treat the increase in fungus activity on produce.<ref name="calncdc">{{cite web|author=National Climatic Data Center|year=1998|title=Event Report for California|accessdate=2007-02-08|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~312841}}</ref> Slick roads from the rain resulted in nearly 80 traffic accidents in [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]], ranging from fender benders to moderate injuries. Thunderstorms from the remnants of Isis damaged a [[San Diego Gas & Electric]] substation at [[Kearny Mesa]], leaving 10,000 without power; the outage was short lived and completely restored within 2&nbsp;hours. About 1,000&nbsp;homes and businesses were temporarily without power in [[Escondido, California|Escondido]], and another 2,700 lost electricity in [[Rancho Bernardo, California|Rancho Bernardo]]. Rainfall in and around [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] reached a maximum of 0.5&nbsp;inches (13&nbsp;mm) at [[La Mesa, California|La Mesa]].<ref name="cns0903">{{cite news|author=Wade Booth|date=1998-09-03|title=Isis Brings Trouble to San Diego County|publisher=City News Service|accessdate=2007-02-09}}</ref> Heavy clouds from Isis produced scattered rainfall and temporary relief to severe heat conditions in the [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] area.<ref name="cns904">{{Cite news|author=City News Service|date=1998-09-04|title=Heat Wave Relief from Isis|accessdate=2007-02-08}}</ref>

Moisture from the remnants of Isis spread across the southwestern United States, with rainfall reaching over 0.75&nbsp;inches (19&nbsp;mm) in [[Nevada]] and [[Utah]]. Low-level moisture dissipated as it continued inland, due to dry air, though upper-level moisture produced light rain across the [[Northwestern United States]]; [[Pocatello, Idaho]] recorded 0.59&nbsp;inches (15&nbsp;mm), while [[Missoula, Montana]] recorded 0.39&nbsp;inches (10&nbsp;mm).<ref>{{cite web|author= Kevin J. Schrab|title=GOES-10 Used to Assess Moisture from Remnants of Isis|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=2007-07-05|url=http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/wrh/LITETAs/9804/index.html}}</ref>

==Aftermath==
Aid programs began immediately after Isis moved ashore and dissipated to provided support to the affected population. The Comisión Nacional del Agua distributed 1.6&nbsp;million gallons (6&nbsp;million [[liter]]s) of water and provided repair equipment to the 173&nbsp;localites whose water systems were damaged. More than 650&nbsp;health workers worked to combat the spread of diseases, including monitoring sanitary conditions of water and foods, and sprayed nearly 9,900&nbsp;acres (40&nbsp;km²) of land to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes. The force also disinfected more than 6,600&nbsp;latrines and removed more than 850 tons of sewage to prevent the spread of epidemic. No medical-related deaths occurred as a result of this attention.<ref name="gob"/>

By 24&nbsp;hours after the passage of the hurricane, workers had restored power to 70% of the affected residents in [[Sinaloa]], and by six days after the storm, electrical service was completely restored. The damage to the federal highway between [[Culiacán]] and [[Los Mochis]] along the coastal region of Sinaloa was restored about 48&nbsp;hours after the passage of the hurricane. The rehabilitation of the agricultural infrastructure began immediately, and most of the drainage networks were repaired by about two weeks after the hurricane. About half of the damaged railways were repaired by about a month after the storm. The total cost for reconstruction and aid amounted to about $18.5&nbsp;million (1998&nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD]], 175&nbsp;million 1998&nbsp;[[MXN]], $23.3&nbsp;million 2007&nbsp;USD), about 94% from federal funds and the rest from state funding. A portion of the funding was allocated to assist the reconstruction of destroyed houses.<ref name="gob"/>

Because the damage Isis caused was neither extreme nor exceptional, the name Isis was not [[List of retired Pacific hurricane names|retired]] by the [[World Meteorological Organization]]. It was re-used for [[2004 Pacific hurricane season#Hurricane Isis|a storm in the in 2004 Pacific hurricane season]], and continues to be on the [[list of tropical cyclone names]] for the [[Post-2008 Pacific hurricane seasons|2010 season]].
