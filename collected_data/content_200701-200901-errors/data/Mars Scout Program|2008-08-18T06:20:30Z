The '''Mars Scout Program''' is a [[NASA]] program to send a series  of small, low-cost missions to [[Mars]], competitively selected from innovative proposals by the scientific community.  

==First Scout mission== 
The first [[robotic spacecraft]] in this program is ''[[Phoenix (spacecraft)|Phoenix]]'', a [[lander (spacecraft)|lander]] originally intended for the cancelled [[Mars Surveyor 2001 Lander|Mars Surveyor]] mission.  Phoenix was launched on [[August 4]], [[2007]], and landed in the icy northern polar region of the planet on [[May 25]] [[2008]].

==Second Scout mission ==
Originally planned for launch in 2011, the second scout mission is now targeted for launch in 2013 due to an organizational conflict of interest that was discovered in one of the mission proposal team's Phase A Concept Study.
The [[Mars 2011|second set of Scout missions]] are under review.<ref name="release">.   {{Cite web

;MAVEN: Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution mission, or MAVEN, would, address key questions about Mars climate and habitability, and improve understanding of dynamic processes in the upper [[Atmosphere of Mars|Martian atmosphere]] and ionosphere. The principal investigator is Dr. Bruce Jakosky, University of Colorado, Boulder. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md., will provide project management.<ref>[http://www.swri.org/3pubs/ird2004/Synopses/159366.htm Mars Upper Atmosphere Orbiter Mission to Study Atmospheric Escape]</ref><ref>[http://www.colorado.edu/news/releases/2007/9.html CU-Boulder Proposal Selected As Finalist For Mission To Probe Past Climate Of Mars]</ref> 

;The Great Escape mission: The mission would directly determine the basic processes in Martian atmospheric evolution by measuring the structure and dynamics of the upper atmosphere. In addition, potentially biogenic atmospheric constituents such as [[methane]] would be measured. The principal investigator is Dr. Alan Stern, Southwest Research Institute, Boulder, Colorado. Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, will provide project management.<ref>[http://www.swri.org/9what/releases/2007/marsscout.htm Southwest Research Institute proposal for Mars Scout orbiter mission selected for study by NASA]</ref>

== Third Scout mission ==
This third installment of the Mars Scout Missions is tentatively scheduled for 2018.
