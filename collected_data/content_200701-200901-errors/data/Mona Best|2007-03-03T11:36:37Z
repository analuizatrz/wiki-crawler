'''Mona Best''', ([[1924]]-[[1988]]) born in [[India]] in 1924, is best known as the mother of [[Pete Best]], an early member of [[The Beatles]]. She also had two other sons, Rory and Roag (Roag's father is longtime Beatles associate [[Neil Aspinall]]). As a resident of Liverpool, England, she pawned all of her jewelry off one day and used the money to place a 33-1 bet on a horse named 'Never Say Die'. With her winnings, she bought a home and opened ''The Casbah Coffee Club'', a venue for rock music, in her basement in [[Liverpool]] as a members-only club for her sons and their friends. [[The Quarry Men]] -- [[John Lennon]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[George Harrison]] and [[Ken Brown (drummer)|Ken Brown]] -- frequently played at The Casbah as other venues such as [[The Cavern]] had a jazz-only policy at that time.  The house with its club trappings still exists, and has been preserved as one most important sites from the Beatles' early career. In 2006 the property was accorded a Grade II Heritage listing.  Mona Best died in 1988.
