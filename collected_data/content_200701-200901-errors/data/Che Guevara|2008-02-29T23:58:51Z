'''Ernesto Guevara de la Serna''' ([[June 14]], [[1928]] &ndash; [[October 9]], [[1967]]), commonly known as '''Che Guevara''' or '''el Che,''' was an [[Argentina|Argentine-born]]  Marxist [[revolutionary]], [[politician|political figure]], and leader of [[Cuba|Cuban]] and  [[Proletarian internationalism|proletarian internationalist]] guerrillas. As a young man, Guevara studied medicine and traveled "{{cref|rough}}" throughout [[Latin America]], activities that brought him into direct contact with the poverty in which many lived.  Through these experiences he became convinced that only revolution could remedy the region's economic inequality, leading him to study [[Marxism]] and become involved in [[Guatemala]]'s [[social revolution]] under President [[Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán]]. 
 
Later while in [[Mexico]] in 1956, Guevara joined [[Fidel Castro]]'s revolutionary [[26th of July Movement]] that fought a guerrilla war and ultimately seized power from the regime of the [[U.S.]]-supported  Cuban [[dictator]] General [[Fulgencio Batista]] in 1959. For a few months after the success of the [[Cuban Revolution]], Guevara was assigned the role of supreme prosecutor, overseeing the revolutionary tribunals and [[executions]] of suspected war criminals associated with the previous regime.

After serving in several important posts in the new government, writing various articles and books about the theory and practice of [[guerrilla warfare]], and touring the world to meet with leaders on behalf of Cuban socialism, Guevara left Cuba in 1965 to foment revolutions, first in [[Congo-Kinshasa]] and then in [[Bolivia]], where he was captured in a military operation supported by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)]] and the [[U.S. Army Special Forces]]. Guevara was [[summary execution|summarily executed]] by the [[Bolivian Army]] in the town of [[La Higuera]] near [[Vallegrande]] on [[October 9]], [[1967]]. 

After his death, Guevara became an [[icon]] of [[socialism|socialist]] revolutionary movements worldwide. An [[Alberto Korda]] [[Che Guevara (photo)|photo]] of him (shown) has received wide distribution and modification. The [[Maryland Institute College of Art]] called this picture "the most famous photograph in the world and a symbol of the 20th century."<ref>Maryland Institute of Art, referenced at BBC News, "Che Guevara photographer dies", 26 May 2001.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1352650.stm Online at BBC News], accessed [[January 4]][[2006]].</ref>

Ernesto Guevara de la Serna was born in [[Rosario]], [[Argentina]], the eldest of five children in a family of mixed [[Spain|Spanish]] and [[Ireland|Irish]] descent; both his father and mother were of [[Basque people|Basque]] ancestry.{{cref|Basque}} The date of birth recorded on [[Media:Ernesto Guevara Acta de Nacimiento.jpg|his birth certificate]] was [[June 14]], [[1928]], although some sources assert that he was actually born on [[May 14]] of that year.<ref>{{Citation

One of Guevara's forebears, Patrick Lynch, was born in [[Galway]], [[Ireland]], in 1715. He left for [[Bilbao]], [[Spain]], and traveled from there to Argentina. Francisco Lynch (Guevara's great-grandfather) was born in 1817, and Ana Lynch (his beloved grandmother) in 1868{{cref|Galway}} Her son, Ernesto Guevara Lynch (Guevara's father) was born in 1900. Guevara Lynch married Celia de la Serna y Llosa in 1927, and they had three sons and two daughters.

In this upper-class family with [[leftist]] leanings, Guevara became known for his dynamic personality and radical perspective even as a boy. Though suffering from the crippling bouts of [[asthma]] that were to afflict him throughout his life, he excelled as an athlete. He was an avid [[rugby union]] player despite his handicap and earned himself the nickname "Fuser" &mdash; a contraction of "El Furibundo" (English: raging) and his mother's surname, "Serna" &mdash; for his aggressive style of play.<ref>{{Citation

Guevara learned [[chess]] from his father and began participating in local tournaments by the age of 12.<ref>Digital Granma Internacional, "Simultaneous chess game on 37th anniversary of Che’s death", [[13 October]] [[2004]]. [http://www.granma.cu/ingles/2004/octubre/mier13/42CHE.html Online at Granma International English Edition], accessed [[January 5]], [[2006]].</ref> During his adolescence, he became passionate about poetry, especially that of [[Pablo Neruda]]. Guevara, as is common practice among Latin Americans of his class, also wrote poems throughout his life. He was an enthusiastic and eclectic reader, with interests ranging from adventure classics by [[Jack London]], [[Emilio Salgari]], and [[Jules Verne]] to essays on [[human sexuality|sexuality]] by [[Sigmund Freud]] and treatises on social philosophy by [[Bertrand Russell]]. In his late teens, he developed a keen interest in photography and spent many hours photographing people, places and, during later travels, [[archeology|archaeological]] sites.

Seated beside him, from left to right: Celia (mother), Celia (sister), Roberto, Juan Martín, Ernesto (father) and Ana María.]]In 1948 Guevara entered the [[University of Buenos Aires]] to study medicine. As a student, he spent long periods traveling around [[Latin America]]. In 1951,  Guevara took a year off from his medical studies to embark on a trip  traversing [[South America]] with his  friend, [[Alberto Granado]]. They set off from their hometown of [[Alta Gracia]] on a [[motorcycle]]  to spend a few weeks volunteering at the San Pablo [[Leper colony]] in [[Peru]] on the banks of the [[Amazon River]]. Guevara narrated this journey in ''[[The Motorcycle Diaries]]'', which was translated into English in 1996 and used in 2004 as the basis for a [[The Motorcycle Diaries (film)|motion picture of the same name]], directed by [[Walter Salles]].
 
Witnessing the widespread poverty, oppression and disenfranchisement throughout Latin America, and influenced by his readings of Marxist literature, Guevara decided that the only solution for the region’s inequalities was armed revolution. His travels and readings also led him to view Latin America not as a group of separate nations but as a single entity requiring a continent-wide strategy for liberation. His conception of a borderless, united [[Hispanic America]] sharing a common '[[mestizo]]' culture{{cref|Hispanic America}} was a theme that would prominently recur during his later revolutionary activities. Upon returning to Argentina, he expedited the completion of his medical studies in order to resume his travels in [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]] and received the diploma accrediting him as a medic on [[12 June]] [[1953]].{{cref|Diploma}}

==Guatemala==
On [[7 July]] [[1953]], Guevara set out on a trip through [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]], [[Ecuador]], [[Panama]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Honduras]] and [[El Salvador]]. In the final days of December 1953 he arrived in [[Guatemala]] where  President [[Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán]] headed a democratically elected government that, through [[land reform]] and other initiatives, was attempting to end the U.S.-dominated ''[[latifundia]]'' system. In a contemporaneous letter to his Aunt Beatriz, Guevara explained his motivation for settling down for a time in Guatemala: "In Guatemala", he wrote, "I will perfect myself and accomplish whatever may be necessary in order to become a true revolutionary."<ref>Guevara Lynch, Ernesto. ''Aquí va un soldado de América''. Barcelona: Plaza y Janés Editores, S.A., 2000,  p. 26.</ref>[[Image:Che Guevara - 2do Viaje - 1953-55.png|thumb|170px|A map showing Che Guevara's movements between 1953 and 1956; including his trip north to Guatemala, his stay in Mexico and his journey east by boat to Cuba with [[Fidel Castro]] and other revolutionaries.]]

Shortly after reaching Guatemala City, Guevara acted upon the suggestion of a mutual friend and sought out Hilda Gadea Acosta, a Peruvian economist who was living and working there. Gadea, whom he would later marry, was well-connected politically as a  member of the socialist [[American Popular Revolutionary Alliance]] (APRA) led by [[Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre]] and she introduced Guevara to a number of high-level officials in the Arbenz government. He also re-established contact with a group of Cuban exiles linked to [[Fidel Castro]] whom he had initially met in Costa Rica; among them was Antonio "Ñico" López, associated with the attack on the "Carlos Manuel de Céspedes" barracks in [[Bayamo]] in the Cuban province of [[Oriente]],<ref>Radio Cadena Agramonte, "Ataque al cuartel del Bayamo" [http://www.cadenagramonte.cubaweb.cu/historia/cuartel_bayamo.asp Online], accessed [[February 25]] [[2006]].</ref> Guevara joined these "[[Moncada Barracks|moncadistas]]" in the sale of religious objects related to the [[Christ#Race of Christ|Black Christ]] of [[Esquipulas]], and he also assisted two Venezuelan [[malaria]] specialists at a local hospital. During this period  he acquired his famous nickname, "Che", due to his frequent use of the Argentine [[interjection]] [[Che (Spanish)|''Che'']] ({{pronounced|tʃe}}), which is used in much the same way as "hey", "pal", "[[eh]]", or "mate" are employed colloquially now in various English-speaking countries. [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]], [[Paraguay]], and southern [[Brazil]] (where the interjection is rendered 'tchê' in written Portuguese) are the only areas where this [[expression]] is used, making it a trademark of the [[Río de la Plata|Rioplatense]] region.

Guevara's attempts to obtain a medical internship were unsuccessful and his economic situation was often precarious.<ref name=precarious> Anderson, Jon Lee. ''Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life'', New York: 1997, Grove Press, p. 139–141</ref> He maintained a distance from any political organization, even though his political thinking at that time manifested a clear sympathy towards communism. Despite his financial woes, he rejected an offer to work as a state medic when he learned that in order to get the job he would have to affiliate himself with the [[Guatemalan Party of Labour|Communist Party of Guatemala]].<ref name=precarious /> Political events in the country began to move quickly after [[May 15]], [[1954]] when a shipment of [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] infantry and light artillery weapons sent from [[Communist]] [[Czechoslovakia]] for the Arbenz Government arrived in [[Puerto Barrios]] aboard the [[Sweden|Swedish]] ship ''[[Alfhem]]''.<ref name=usdepstate>

Guevara briefly left Guatemala for El Salvador to pick up a new visa, then returned to Guatemala only a few days before the CIA-sponsored coup attempt led by [[Carlos Castillo Armas]] began.<ref name=usdepstate /> The anti-Arbenz forces tried, but failed, to stop the trans-shipment of the Czechoslovak weapons by train. However, after pausing to regroup and recover energy, Castillo Armas' column seized the initiative and — apparently with the assistance of US air support — started to gain ground.<ref>Holland, Max. "Private Sources of U.S. Foreign Policy: William Pawley and the 1954 Coup d'Etat in Guatemala", ''Journal of Cold War Studies'', Volume 7, Number 4, Fall 2005, pp. 36–73</ref> Guevara was eager to fight on behalf of Arbenz and joined an armed [[militia]] organized by the Communist Youth for that purpose; but, frustrated with the group's inaction, he soon returned to medical duties. Following the coup, he again volunteered to fight but his efforts were thwarted when Arbenz took refuge in the Mexican Embassy and told his foreign supporters to leave the country. After Gadea was arrested, Guevara sought protection inside the Argentine [[consulate]] where he remained until he received a safe-conduct pass some weeks later. At that point, he turned down a free seat on a flight back to Argentina that was offered to him by the embassy, preferring instead to make his way to [[Mexico]].

The overthrow of the Arbenz regime by a [[Operation PBSUCCESS|coup d'état backed by the Central Intelligence Agency]] cemented Guevara's view of the United States as an [[imperialism|imperialist]] power that would implacably oppose and attempt to destroy any government that sought to redress the socioeconomic inequality endemic to Latin America and other developing countries. This strengthened his conviction that socialism achieved through armed struggle and defended by an armed populace was the only way to rectify such conditions.

Guevara arrived in [[Mexico City]] in early September 1954, and shortly thereafter renewed his friendship with Ñico López and the other Cuban exiles whom he had known in Guatemala. While living in Mexico, Guevara worked in the allergy ward of the General Hospital and supplemented his salary as a photographer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofcuba.com/history/chebio.htm|title=Che Guevara bio - History of Cuba|publisher=www.historyofcuba.com|accessdate=2008-02-28|last=|first=}}</ref>

It was during this time in June 1955, that López introduced him to [[Raúl Castro]]. Several weeks later, [[Fidel Castro]] arrived in Mexico City after having been amnestied from prison in Cuba, and on the evening of [[8 July]], [[1955]], Raúl introduced Guevara to the older Castro brother. During a fervid overnight conversation, Guevara became convinced that Fidel was the inspirational revolutionary leader for whom he had been searching, and he immediately joined the [[26th of July Movement]] plotting to overthrow the dictatorship of [[Fulgencio Batista]]. Although it was planned that he would be the group's medic, Guevara participated in the military training with the other members of the  Movement, and at the end of the course, was singled out by their instructor, Col. [[Alberto Bayo]], as his most outstanding student.<ref name=anderson2>{{Citation| last =Anderson| first =Jon Lee| year =1997

In the summer of 1955, she informed him that she was [[pregnant]], and he immediately suggested that they marry.

When the cabin cruiser ''[[Granma (yacht)|Granma]]'' set out from [[Tuxpan]], [[Veracruz]] for Cuba on [[November 25]], [[1956]], Guevara was one of only four non-Cubans aboard.{{cref|non-Cubans}} Attacked by Batista's military soon after landing, about half of the expeditionaries were killed or executed upon capture. Guevara wrote that it was during this confrontation that he laid down his knapsack containing medical supplies in order to pick up a box of ammunition dropped by a fleeing comrade, a moment which he later recalled as marking his transition from physician to combatant.{{cref|Knapsack}} 

Guevara became a leader among the rebels, a ''Comandante'' (English translation: Major), respected by his comrades in arms for his courage and military prowess,{{Dead link|date=February 2008}}<!--<ref>U.

Individual chapters of ''Pasajes'', which was based on the war diary Guevara kept during the guerrilla campaign, first appeared in ''Verde Olivo'', the official magazine of the Cuban armed forces, beginning in 1961.

On 12 June 1959, Guevara set out on a three-month tour of fourteen countries, most of them [[Asian-African Conference|Bandung Pact]] members in Africa and Asia. He spent twelve days in Japan (15 - 27 July), participating in negotiations aimed at expanding Cuba's trade relations with that nation. While there, he requested that the Japanese government arrange for him to visit the city of [[Hiroshima]], where the American military had [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|detonated]] an [[Little_Boy|atom-bomb]] fourteen years earlier. When the Japanese government refused to add Hiroshima to his delegation's itinerary, Guevara surreptitiously left his [[Osaka]] hotel to secretly visit Hiroshima by night train along with his aide Omar Fernández. According to Fernández, who served as the deputy head of the mission, Guevara was "really shocked" at what he saw and by their visit to a hospital where A-bomb survivors were being treated.<ref>[http://www.hdrjapan.com/japan/japan-news/aide-reveals-che-guevara's-secret-trip-to-hiroshima/ Aide reveals Che Guevara's secret trip to Hiroshima, 14 October 2007, by Manabu Niwata, Mainichi correspondent]</ref>

Later, Guevara became an official at the National Institute of Agrarian Reform,{{cref|INRA}} and President of the National Bank of Cuba.{{cref|BNC}} He signed all Cuban banknotes issued during his fourteen-month presidency with his nickname, "Che".{{cref|Signature}} Throughout his time in the Cuban government, Guevara refused his due salaries of office, insisting on drawing only his wages as army ''comandante'' in order to set a "revolutionary example".<ref name=anderson>Anderson, Jon Lee.

As early as 1959, Guevara helped organize revolutionary expeditions overseas, all of which failed. The first attempt was made in [[Panama]]; another in the [[Dominican Republic]] (led by Henry Fuerte,<ref>Puerto Padre website, "Cronologia" (List of anniversaries)[http://www.periodico26.cu/puerto_padre/cronologia/cronologia_agosto.htm Online at Puerto Padre website], accessed [[January 4]] [[2006]].</ref> also known as "El Argelino", and Enrique Jiménez Moya)<ref>Peña, Emilio Herasme," La Expedición Armada de junio de 1959", [[14 June]] [[2004]].

In 1960 Guevara provided first aid to victims when the freighter ''[[La Coubre explosion|La Coubre]]'', a French vessel carrying munitions from the port of Antwerp, exploded while it was being unloaded in Havana harbor. A rescue operation immediately ensued but went awry when a second explosion occurred, resulting in well over a hundred dead.<ref>Cuban Information Archives, "La Coubre explodes in Havana 1960."

Guevara later served as Minister of Industries,{{cref|MININD}} in which post he helped formulate Cuban [[socialism]], and became one of the country's most prominent figures. He called for the diversification of the Cuban economy, and for the elimination of what he called "material incentives". He believed that volunteer work and dedication of workers would drive economic growth, all that was needed was will. To display this Guevara led by example, working endlessly at his ministry job, in construction, and even cutting sugar cane. <ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/castro/peopleevents/p_guevara.html PBS: Che Guevara, Popular but Ineffective]</ref> Time was also set aside to write several publications. In his book ''[[Guerrilla Warfare (book)|Guerrilla Warfare]]'', he advocated replicating the Cuban model of revolution initiated by a small group (''[[foco]]'') of guerrillas without the need for broad organizations to precede armed insurrection. His essay ''El socialismo y el hombre en Cuba'' (1965) (''Man and Socialism in Cuba'') advocates the need to shape a "new man" (''hombre nuevo'') in conjunction with a socialist state. Some saw Guevara as the simultaneously glamorous and austere model of that "new man."

During the 1961 [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]], Guevara did not participate in the fighting, having been ordered by Castro to a command post in Cuba's westernmost [[Pinar del Río Province|Pinar del Río province]] where he was involved in fending off a decoy force. He did, however, suffer a bullet wound to the face during this deployment, which he said had been caused by the accidental discharge of his own gun.<ref name=anderson2>Anderson, Jon Lee.

Guevara played a key role in bringing to Cuba the Soviet nuclear-armed [[ballistic missile]]s that precipitated the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] in October 1962. During an interview with the British newspaper ''[[Daily Worker]]'' some weeks later, he stated that, if the missiles had been under Cuban control, they would have fired them against major U.S. cities.<ref name=anderson3/>[[Image:Beauvoir Sartre - Che Guevara -1960 - Cuba.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Meeting with [[France|French]] philosophers [[Jean Paul Sartre]] and [[Simone de Beauvoir]] in 1960.

In December 1964 Guevara traveled to [[New York City]] as the head of the Cuban delegation to speak at the [[United Nations|UN]]([http://www.bbc.co.uk/spanish/audio/seriemilenio02a.ram listen], <small>requires [[RealPlayer]]</small>; or [http://www.rcgfrfi.easynet.co.uk/ww/guevara/1964-cid.htm read]). He also appeared on the [[CBS]] Sunday news program ''[[Face the Nation]]'', met with a gamut of individuals and groups including U.S. Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]], several associates of [[Malcolm X]], and Canadian radical [[Michelle Duclos]],<ref>Montreal Gazette, "Liberals picked the wrong issue".

''Che in Africa: Che Guevara's Congo Diary''. Melbourne: Ocean Press, 1999, p. 28.</ref> On [[17 December]], he flew to [[Paris]] and from there embarked on a three-month international tour during which he visited the [[People's Republic of China]], the [[United Arab Republic]] ([[Egypt]]), [[Algeria]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Mali]], [[Benin|Dahomey]], [[Republic of the Congo|Congo-Brazzaville]], and [[Tanzania]], with stops in [[Ireland]], [[Paris]], and [[Prague]]. He also visited [[Pyongyang]] and told the press that [[North Korea]] was a model to which revolutionary Cuba should aspire.<ref>Bruce Cumings, "Korea’s Place in the Sun: A Modern History", updated edition, W.W. Norton & Company, 2005, p. 404.</ref>

In [[Algiers]] on [[24 February]], [[1965]], he made what turned out to be his last public appearance on the international stage when he delivered a speech to the "Second Economic Seminar on Afro-Asian Solidarity" in which he declared, "There are no frontiers in this struggle to the death. We cannot remain indifferent in the face of what occurs in any part of the world. A victory for any country against imperialism is our victory, just as any country's defeat is our defeat."<ref>Ernesto Che Guevara, (editors Rolando E. Bonachea and Nelson P. Valdés), ''Che: Selected Works of Ernesto Guevara'', Cambridge, MA: 1969, p. 350.</ref><ref name=algiers>Ernesto Che Guevara, "English Translation of Complete Text of Algiers Speech",
[http://www.sozialistische-klassiker.org/Che/Chee13.html Online at Sozialistische Klassiker], accessed [[January 4]] [[2006]].</ref> Guevara also displayed his disillusionment with the [[Soviet Union]], by attacking Moscow and questioning its commitment to international socialism. In his criticism he declared: "The socialist countries are, in a way, accomplices of [[imperialism|imperialist]] exploitation." <ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/castro/peopleevents/p_guevara.html PBS: Che Guevara, Critic of the Soviets]</ref> He went on to say that "The socialist countries have the moral duty of liquidating their tacit complicity with the exploiting countries of the West." He proceeded to outline a number of measures which he said the communist-bloc countries should implement in order to accomplish this objective.<ref>Ernesto Che Guevara, (editors Rolando E. Bonachea and Nelson P. Valdés), ''Che: Selected Works of Ernesto Guevara'', Cambridge, MA: 1969, pp. 352-59.</ref><ref name=algiers /> He returned to Cuba on [[14 March]] to a solemn reception by Fidel and Raúl Castro, [[Osvaldo Dorticós]] and Carlos Rafael Rodríguez at the Havana airport.

Two weeks later, Guevara dropped out of public life and then vanished. His whereabouts were the mystery of 1965 in Cuba, as he was generally regarded as second in power to Castro himself. His disappearance was attributed to the relative failure of the [[industrialization]] scheme he had advocated while minister of industry, to pressure exerted on Castro by Soviet officials disapproving of Guevara's pro-[[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist]] bent as the [[Sino-Soviet split]] grew more pronounced, and to serious differences between Guevara and the Cuban leadership regarding Cuba's economic development and ideological line.<ref>Guevara, Ernesto Che. ''The Great Debate on Political Economy'', New York: 2006, Ocean Press, 430 pages (entire book is devoted to this subject).</ref>

Following the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and what he perceived as a Soviet betrayal of Cuba when [[Khrushchev]] agreed to withdraw the missiles from Cuban territory without consulting Castro, Guevara had grown increasingly skeptical of the Soviet Union. As revealed in his last speech in Algiers, he had come to view the [[Northern Hemisphere]], led by the U.S. in the West and the Soviet Union in the East, as the exploiter of the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. He strongly supported [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Communist]] [[North Vietnam]] and the [[Viet Cong]] in the [[Vietnam War]], and urged the peoples of other developing countries to take up arms and create "100 Vietnams".<ref>Ernesto Che Guevara, "English Translation of Complete Text of his ''Message to the Tricontinental''", or see [[s:es:Mensaje a los Pueblos del Mundo|Original Spanish text at Wikisource]].</ref>[[Image:Che-airport-14mar65.jpg|thumb|left|Guevara with members of his "reception committee" at Havana airport<br /><small>([[Havana]] - [[14 March]] [[1965]]).</small>]]

Pressed by international speculation regarding Guevara's fate, Castro stated on [[16 June]], [[1965]], that the people would be informed about Guevara when Guevara himself wished to let them know. Numerous rumors about his disappearance spread inside and outside Cuba. On [[3 October]] that year, Castro revealed a handwritten undated letter<ref name=farewell>Ernesto Che Guevara, "Che Guevara's Farewell Letter", 1965. English translation of complete text: [[s:Che Guevara's Farewell Letter|Che Guevara's Farewell Letter at Wikisource]].</ref> purportedly written to him by Guevara some months earlier in which Guevara reaffirmed his enduring solidarity with the Cuban Revolution but declared his intention to leave Cuba to fight abroad for the cause of the revolution. He explained that "Other nations of the world summon my modest efforts," and that he had therefore decided to go and fight as a guerrilla "on new battlefields". In the letter Guevara announced his resignation from all his positions in the government, in the party, and in the Army, and renounced his Cuban citizenship, which had been granted to him in 1959 in recognition of his efforts on behalf of the revolution.

During an interview with four foreign correspondents on [[1 November]], Castro remarked that he knew where Guevara was but would not disclose his location, and added, denying reports that his former comrade-in-arms was dead, that "he is in the best of health." Despite Castro's assurances, Guevara's fate remained a mystery at the end of 1965 and his movements and whereabouts continued to be a closely held secret for the next two years.

According to [[Ahmed Ben Bella]], who was president of [[Algeria]] at the time and had recently held extended conversations with Guevara, "The situation prevailing in Africa, which seemed to have enormous revolutionary potential, led Che to the conclusion that Africa was imperialism’s weak link. It was to Africa that he now decided to devote his efforts."

The Cuban operation was to be carried out in support of the pro-[[Patrice Lumumba]] Marxist Simba movement in the Congo-Kinshasa (formerly [[Belgian Congo]], later [[Zaire]] and currently the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]). Guevara, his second-in-command [[Victor Dreke]], and twelve of the Cuban expeditionaries arrived in the Congo on [[24 April]] [[1965]]; a contingent of approximately 100 [[Afro-Cuban]]s joined them soon afterwards.<ref>Gálvez, William.

Guevara dismissed Kabila as insignificant. "Nothing leads me to believe he is the man of the hour," Guevara wrote.<ref>BBC News, "Profile: Laurent Kabila", [[26 May]] [[2001]].

Although Guevara was 37 at the time and had no formal military training, he had the experiences of the Cuban revolution, including his successful march on Santa Clara, which was central to Batista's finally being overthrown by Castro's forces. His asthma had prevented his being drafted into military service in Argentina, a fact of which he was proud given his opposition to [[Juan Perón|Perón's]] government.

South African mercenaries including [[Mike Hoare]] and [[Cuba]]n exiles worked with the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] army to thwart Guevara. They were able to monitor his communications, arrange to ambush the rebels and the Cubans whenever they attempted to attack, and interdict his supply lines.<!--<ref>African History Blog, "Che Guevara's Exploits in the Congo", [http://africanhistory.about.com/b/a/227091.htm Che Guevara's Exploits in the Congo Online at African History], accessed [[January 5]] [[2006]].</ref>--><!--<ref>Mad Mike Hoare Site, "Mad Mike".

Guevara's aim was to export the Cuban Revolution by instructing local Simba fighters in communist ideology and [[foco]] strategies of [[guerrilla warfare]]. In his ''Congo Diary'', he cites the incompetence, intransigence and infighting of the local Congolese forces as key reasons for the revolt's failure.<ref>Ireland's Own, "From Cuba to Congo, Dream to Disaster for Che Guevara". [http://irelandsown.net/Che2.html Online at irelandsown.net], accessed [[January 11]] [[2006]].</ref> Later that year, ill with dysentery, suffering from asthma, and disheartened after seven months of frustrations, Guevara left the Congo with the Cuban survivors (six members of his column had died). At one point Guevara considered sending the wounded back to Cuba, then standing alone and fighting until the end in the Congo as a revolutionary example; however, after being urged by his comrades and pressed by two emissaries sent by Castro, at the last moment he reluctantly agreed to leave the Congo. A few weeks later, writing the preface to the diary he kept during the Congo venture, he began: "This is the history of a failure."<ref>Ernesto Che Guevara, translated from the Spanish by Patrick Camiller, ''The African Dream'', New York: Grove Publishers, 2000, p.1.</ref>

Because Castro had made public Guevara's "farewell letter"<ref name=farewell /> to him &mdash; a letter Guevara had intended should only be revealed in case of his death &mdash; wherein he had written that he was severing all ties to Cuba in order to devote himself to revolutionary activities in other parts of the world, he felt he could not return to Cuba with the surviving combatants for moral reasons,<ref>Castañeda, Jorge G., ''Che Guevara: Compañero'', New York: 1998, Random House, p 316.</ref>  and he spent the next six months living clandestinely in [[Dar-es-Salaam]], and [[Prague]]. During this time he compiled his memoirs of the Congo experience, and wrote drafts of two more books, one on philosophy<ref>Ernesto Che Guevara, ''Apuntes Filosóficos'', draft.</ref> and the other on economics.<ref>Ernesto Che Guevara, ''Notas Económicas'', draft.</ref> He also visited several countries in Western Europe to test a new false identity and the corresponding documentation (passport, etc.) created for him by [[DGI|Cuban Intelligence]] that he planned to use to travel to South America. Throughout this period Castro continued to importune him to return to Cuba, but Guevara only agreed to do so when it was understood he would be there only for the few months needed to prepare a revolutionary effort somewhere in Latin America, and that his presence on the island would be secret.

==Bolivia==
===Insurgent===
[[Image:CheinBolivia1.jpg|thumb|left|230px|In rural [[Bolivia]] shortly before his death, 1967.]] 
Speculation on Guevara's whereabouts continued throughout 1966 and into 1967. Representatives of the [[Mozambique|Mozambican]] independence movement [[FRELIMO]] reported meeting with Guevara in late 1966 or early 1967 in [[Dar es Salaam]], at which point they rejected his offer of aid in their revolutionary project.<ref>Mittleman, James H. ''Underdevelopment and the Transition to Socialism - Mozambique and Tanzania'', New York: 1981, Academic Press, p. 38.</ref> In a speech at the 1967 [[May Day]] rally in Havana, the Acting Minister of the armed forces, Major [[Juan Almeida]], announced that Guevara was "serving the revolution somewhere in Latin America". The persistent reports that he was leading the guerrillas in Bolivia were eventually shown to be true.

At Castro's behest.<ref>{{Citation

, a {{convert|3700|acre|sqkm|sing=on}} parcel of jungle land in the remote Ñancahuazú region had been purchased by native Bolivian Communists for Guevara to use as a training area and base camp.{{cref|Camp}} Training at this camp in the Ñancahuazú valley proved to be more hazardous than combat to Guevara and the Cubans accompanying him. Little was accomplished in the way of building a guerrilla army. Former [[Stasi]] operative [[Haydée Tamara Bunke Bider]], better known by her ''[[nom de guerre]]'' "Tania", who had been installed as his primary agent in La Paz, was reportedly also working for the [[KGB]] and is widely inferred to have unwittingly served Soviet interests by leading Bolivian authorities to Guevara's trail.<ref>Major Donald R. Selvage - USMC, "Che Guevara in Bolivia", [[1 April]] [[1985]]. [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1985/SDR.htm Online at GlobalSecurity.org], accessed [[January 5]] [[2006]].</ref> The numerous photographs taken by and of Guevara and other members of his guerrilla group that they left behind at their base camp after the initial clash with the Bolivian army in March 1967 provided President [[René Barrientos]] with the first proof of his presence in Bolivia; after viewing them, Barrientos allegedly stated that he wanted Guevara's head displayed on a pike in downtown [[La Paz]]. He thereupon ordered the Bolivian Army to hunt Guevara and his followers down.

[[Image:Vallegrande location.png|thumb||160px|right|Map of Bolivia showing location of [[Vallegrande]].]]
Guevara's guerrilla force, numbering about 50 and operating as the ELN (''Ejército de Liberación Nacional de Bolivia''; English: "[[National Liberation Army of Bolivia]]"), was well equipped and scored a number of early successes against Bolivian regulars in the difficult terrain of the mountainous Camiri region. In September, however, the Army managed to eliminate two guerrilla groups, reportedly killing one of the leaders.

Despite the violent nature of the conflict, Guevara gave medical attention to all of the wounded Bolivian soldiers whom the guerrillas took prisoner, and subsequently released them. Even after his last battle at the Quebrada del Yuro, in which he had been wounded, when he was taken to a temporary holding location and saw there a number of Bolivian soldiers who had also been wounded in the fighting, he offered to give them medical care. His offer was turned down by the Bolivian officer in charge.<ref>Taibo, Paco Ignacio II. ''Ernesto Guevara, también conocido como el Che'', Barcelona, 1999: Editorial Planeta, p 726.</ref> 

Guevara's plan for fomenting revolution in Bolivia appears to have failed because it was based upon a number of misconceptions:
*He had expected to deal only with the country's military government and its poorly trained and equipped army. However, after the U.S. government learned of his location, CIA and other operatives were sent into Bolivia to aid the anti-insurrection effort. The Bolivian Army was being trained and supplied by [[U.S. Army Special Forces]]{{cref|USMilitary}} advisors, including a recently organized elite battalion of [[United States Army Rangers|Rangers]] trained in [[jungle warfare]] that set up camp in La Esperanza, a small settlement close to the guerrillas' zone of operations.<ref>U.S. Army, "[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB5/che14_1.htm Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Activation, Organization and Training of the 2d Ranger Battalion – Bolivian Army ([[28 April]] [[1967]])]".

'' The Fall of Che Guevara : A Story of Soldiers, Spies, and Diplomats'', New York, 1998: Oxford University Press, p 82–102, inter alia.</ref>
*Guevara had expected assistance and cooperation from the local dissidents. He did not receive it; and Bolivia's Communist Party, under the leadership of [[Mario Monje]], was oriented towards Moscow rather than Havana and did not aid him, despite having promised to do so. Some members of the Bolivian Communist Party did join/support him, such as Coco and Inti Peredo, Rodolfo Saldaña, Serapio Aquino Tudela, and Antonio Jiménez Tardio, against the Party leadership's wishes.
*He had expected to remain in radio contact with Havana. However, the two shortwave transmitters provided to him by Cuba were faulty, so that the guerrillas were unable to communicate with Havana. In this, and in many other respects, [[Manuel Piñeiro]], the man to whom Castro had assigned the task of coordinating support for Guevara's operations in Bolivia, performed abysmally. To further complicate matters, some months into the campaign, the tape recorder that the guerrillas used to record and decipher the [[one-time pad]]-encoded radio messages sent to them from Havana was lost while crossing a river, making de-coding such messages more difficult.{{cref|Message}}

In addition, his penchant for confrontation rather than compromise appears to have contributed to his inability to develop successful working relationships with local leaders in Bolivia, just as it had in the Congo.<ref>Ernesto Che Guevara, "Excerpt from ''Pasajes de la guerra revolucionaria: Congo''", [http://www.wilsoncenter.org/index.cfm?topic_id=1409&fuseaction=va2.document&identifier=5034C64B-96B6-175C-97A3C636C37896FB&sort=Collection&item=The%20Cold%20War%20in%20Africa Online at Cold War International History Project], accessed [[April 26]] [[2006]].</ref> This tendency had surfaced during his guerrilla warfare campaign in Cuba as well, but had been kept in check there by the timely interventions and guidance of Castro.<ref>Castañeda, Jorge G.

[http://www.uco.es/~i62guigm/che/diario.htm Online], accessed [[February 26]] [[2006]].</ref> The first entry is on [[November 7]] [[1966]] shortly after his arrival at the farm in Ñancahuazú, and the last entry is on [[October 7]] [[1967]], the day before his capture. The diary tells how the guerrillas were forced to begin operations prematurely due to discovery by the Bolivian Army, explains Guevara's decision to divide the column into two units that were subsequently unable to re-establish contact, and describes their overall failure. It records the rift between Guevara and the Bolivian Communist Party that resulted in Guevara having significantly fewer soldiers than originally anticipated. It shows that Guevara had a great deal of difficulty recruiting from the local populace, due in part to the fact that the guerrilla group had learned [[Quechua]] rather than the local language which was [[Tupí-Guaraní]]. As the campaign drew to an unexpected close, Guevara became increasingly ill. He suffered from ever-worsening bouts of asthma, and most of his last offensives were carried out in an attempt to obtain medicine.

The Bolivian Diary was quickly and crudely translated by ''[[Ramparts (magazine)|Ramparts]]'' magazine and circulated around the world. There are at least four additional diaries in existence &mdash; those of Israel Reyes Zayas (Alias "Braulio"), Harry Villegas Tamayo ("Pombo"), Eliseo Reyes Rodriguez ("Rolando")<ref>Major Donald R. Selvage - USMC, "Che Guevara in Bolivia", [[1 April]] [[1985]]. [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1985/SDR.htm Online at GlobalSecurity.org], accessed [[January 5]] [[2006]];</ref> and Dariel Alarcón Ramírez ("Benigno")<ref>Alarcón Ramírez, Dariel dit "Benigno". ''Le Che en Bolivie'', Paris: 1997, Éditions du Rocher</ref> &mdash;
each of which reveals additional aspects of the events in question.

Some see Che Guevara as a hero. [[Nelson Mandela]], for example, referred to him as: "An inspiration for every human being who loves freedom" <ref>Editorial Review of The Bolivian Diary on[http://www.amazon.com/Bolivian-Diary-Authorized-Guevara-Publishing/dp/1920888241 Amazon.com] --- This quote also appears in the opening trailer for [[The Motorcycle Diaries (film)]] --> [http://www.focusfeatures.com/clips/the_motorcycle_diaries/trailer-480x270.wmv Trailer] </ref> and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], described him as "the most complete human being of our age".<ref>Michael Moynihan, "Neutering Sartre at Dagens Nyheter".

Conversely, others view him as a spokesman for a failed ideology and as a ruthless executioner. [[Johann Hari]], for example, wrote that "...Che Guevara is not a free-floating icon of rebellion. He was an actual person who supported an actual system of tyranny, one that murdered millions more actual people."<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/johann-hari/johann-hari-should-che-be-an-icon-no-394336.html Johann Hari: Should Che be an icon?

<!-- See [[Template:cref]] and [[Template:cnote]] for an explanation of how to create content notes for this section -->
*{{cnote|rough|(Definition: "To live without the usual comforts and conveniences"
:During his youthful travels, Guevara carried a minimal amount of money and tried to spend it only on food.  While making their 1952 trip, he and Alberto Granado received along the way several "collections" given to them by local people and/or other travellers who were concerned about their apparent destitution.  It is hoped that the following lists will cast further light on the circumstances in which they made this trip and the meaning of the phrase ''travelling rough''.
::* ''Conveyances used:'' motorcycle "La Poderosa II" (broke down completely and was abandoned in Santiago de Chile on [[2 March]] [[1952]]); various launches; steamboat; freighter (as stowaways); taxi; bus; various trucks (hitch-hiking); Land-Rover (lent by a friend); train; horse; riverboat; raft "Mambo Tango"; Indian dugout canoe; sea plane; armored police van; cargo plane
::* ''Nights spent in:'' houses of friends, acquaintances and strangers; hospital rooms; police sentry box; shack; shed; jail cell; outside "under the stars"; garage; lean-to; kitchen of forest ranger's cabin; hayloft; police barracks; boathouse; hut; fire station attic; derelict ("haunted") house; cab of truck; Centre for the Prevention of Yellow Fever; police headquarters; forest ranger sentry post; railroad station; Chilean National Guard barracks; bus station; boarding house; guest house room; "dump"; municipal parks (in Miami)
:Additionally, in 1950 Guevara made a solo tour of the northern provinces of Argentina on his motorized bike "Micrón" (1950); in that same year, he also travelled up and down the eastern coast of South America aboard petrol tankers and other ships while working as a nurse in the Argentine Merchant Marine and visited many port cities along their routes.}}

*{{cnote|Basque|Re origin of the surname Guevara &mdash; "Basque: Castilianized form of Basque '''Gebara''', a habitational name from a place in the Basque province of Araba. The origin and meaning of the place name are uncertain; it is recorded in the form Gebala by the geographer Ptolemy in the 2nd century ad. This is a rare name in Spain." ''Dictionary of American Family Names'', Patrick Hanks, ed., London: 2003, Oxford University Press.  His mother, Celia de la Serna, had also inherited Basque blood through her father, Juan Martín de la Serna Ugalde. One of Celia's collateral ancestors was the last Viceroy of Perú, [[José de la Serna e Hinojosa|General José de la Serna e Hinojosa]], who was likewise of documented Basque origin.<ref>http://urumelb.tripod.com/che/biografia-del-che-guevara.htm</ref><ref>For detailed genealogical information about Che Guevara, including his family tree, see [http://en.rodovid.org/wk/Person:24256 Genealogy of Ernesto Guevara de la Serna]</ref>}}

*{{cnote|Galway|The Lynch family was one of the famous 14 [[Tribes of Galway]]. Patrick travelled extensively around South America before finally settling in Argentina where he became a prosperous merchant. His descendants include the Chilean rear admiral Patricio Lynch Zaldívar (1824-1886), and the distinguished Argentine writers Benito Lynch (1882-1951) and Adolfo Bioy Casares (1914-1999).<ref>For more information, see [http://www.irlandeses.org/dilab_guevarae.htm Dictionary of Irish Latin American Biography  Guevara, Ernesto [Che] (1928-1967)]</ref> The misconception exists that Ana María Isabel Lynch was born in Ireland, whereas she was actually born (1868) in San Francisco, California, USA where her father, Francisco Lynch, had traveled from Argentina during the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]] years. Francisco had married a young Californian widow, Eloísa Ortiz, ca. 1860 and they had several other American-born children in addition to Ana Isabel. The man Ana Isabel would eventually marry, Roberto Guevara Castro, had also been born in California, USA of an Argentine father and a Californian mother who was the grand-daughter of the Spanish aristocrat Don [[Luís María Peralta]] who had been given large land grants (including {{convert|44800|acre|sqkm}} encompassing the [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]] region of California) by the King of Spain. Despite the fact that they were both born in the [[Bay area]] of California, Ana Isabel and Roberto did not meet until after their respective families had returned to Argentina in the 1880s. During Che Guevara's childhood, listening to his Grandmother Ana Isabel's tales of frontier life in California was one of his greatest delights.}}

*{{cnote|Diploma|While commonly referred to as a doctor, the medical degree conferred was of a medic, a lower degree of the time.<ref>Ernesto Che Guevara: Mito Y Realidad , by Enrique Ros (ISBN 0897299884)</ref> Also note, the below sources show record of a medic education, but then identify it as a "doctor", confused with the fact that medical education of the time could lead to two outcomes, that of a medic, or after clinical training that of a doctor.
::The University de Buenos Aires has no record of him receiving a medical degree or a medic degree, though it is likely his educational records were lost or destroyed.

*{{cnote|Ibero-America|In a brief speech at the San Pablo leprosarium in Peru on the occasion of his 24th birthday, Guevara said: "Although we're too insignificant to be spokesmen for such a noble cause, we believe, and this journey has only served to confirm this belief, that the division of America into unstable and illusory nations is a complete fiction. We are one single [[mestizo]] race with remarkable ethnographical similarities, from Mexico down to the Magellan Straits. And so, in an attempt to break free from all narrow-minded provincialism, I propose a toast to Peru and to a United America."<ref>Guevara, Ernesto Che, ''Motorcycle Diaries'', London: Verso Books, 1995, p.135.</ref>}}

*{{cnote|non-Cubans|"There were four non-Cubans on board -- Guevara, from Argentina; Gino Doné, an Italian; Guillén, a Mexican; and the pilot Ramón Mejía del Castillo ('Pichirilo'), a Dominican who had been on the abortive Cayo Confites expedition."<ref>Thomas, Hugh.

*{{cnote|Algeria|In September 1962, Algeria asked Cuba for assistance when [[Morocco]] declared war on it over their dispute concerning the territory formerly known as the [[Western Sahara|Spanish Sahara]]. Cuba responded by sending a contingent of Cuban officers and troops totalling 686 men and some 60 tanks to support the Algerian forces. Shortly after news of the landing of the Cuban troops at [[Oran]] leaked to the press, King [[Hassan II of Morocco]] agreed to sign a cease-fire with President [[Ben Bella]] of Algeria. The Cuban expeditionary force remained in Algeria for six months, during which time they set up the military equipment they had brought and trained their Algerian counterparts in its use. Guevara played a major role in organizing and executing the Cuban deployment.<ref>Piero Gliejeses, "Cuba's First Venture in Africa: Algeria, 1961&ndash;1965", ''Journal of Latin American Studies'', no. 28, London: Cambridge University Press, Spring 1996, p. 188</ref><ref>Castañeda, pp. 244–245.</ref>}}

*{{cnote|Kabila|In May 1997, Laurent-Désiré Kabila overthrew the government of [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] and became President of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. He held that position until his assassination on [[January 16]], [[2001]] and was succeeded in the presidency by his son, [[Joseph Kabila]].}}

*{{cnote|NSA|"The intercept operators knew that Dar-es-Salaam was serving as a communications center for the fighters, receiving messages from Castro in Cuba and relaying them on to the guerrillas deep in the bush.  Guevara transmitted his progress reports and requests for supplies back through that same channel.  Every day at 8:00 A.M., 2:30 P.M., and 7:00 P.M., one of Guevara's radio operators would also make contact with the jungle base at Kigoma."<ref>Bamford, James, ''Body of Secrets: Anatomy of the Ultra-Secret National Security Agency'', New York: Anchor Books, 2002 (Reprint edition), p. 181.</ref>}}

*{{cnote|Camp|The purchase of the acreage in the Ñancahuazú region was in direct contravention of Guevara's directive that the land for the camp should be purchased in the Alto Beni region. When presented with the ''fait accompli'' that the Bolivian Communists had acquired land in the Ñancahuazú region instead, he at first complained but eventually decided to utilize it in order not to lose time while waiting for them to purchase a parcel in the Alto Beni.}}

*{{cnote|USMilitary|"U.S. military personnel in Bolivia never exceeded 53 advisors, including a sixteen-man Mobile Training Team (MTT) from the [[8th Special Forces Group]] based at Fort Gulick, Panama Canal Zone. Commanded by Major Ralph ('Pappy') Shelton, the MTT set up a training camp near Santa Cruz. The advisors arrived on April 29 and instituted a 19 week counter-insurgency training program for the Bolivian 2nd Ranger Battalion. The intensive course included training in weapons, individual combat, squad and platoon tactics, patrolling, and counter-insurgency. The Bolivians responded well to the training and quickly developed into a spirited, confident, and effective counter guerrilla unit."<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1985/SDR.htm ''Che Guevara in Bolivia''] by Major Donald R. Selvage.</ref>}}

*{{cnote|Message|For example, on [[August 31]] [[1967]] Che wrote in his diary "Hay mensaje de Manila pero no se pudo copiar.", i.e. "There is a (coded radio) message from Manila ('Manila' being the code name for Havana) but we couldn't copy it." The content of this message has not been revealed, but it may have been of critical importance since by then Castro and the other Cubans who were directing the guerrillas' support network from Havana had to be aware of their dire straits.}}

*{{cnote|Barrientos|Although Barrientos never revealed his motives for ordering the summary execution of Guevara, some of his associates have suggested that he took this decision primarily in order to avoid the spectacle of a "show trial" that would have brought unwelcome international attention to Bolivia, and that he was also concerned that, had Guevara been sentenced to a lengthy term in a Bolivian prison, he might have escaped or eventually been released (as in Fidel Castro's case), and subsequently resumed his guerrilla activities.}}

*{{cnote|Amputation|Castañeda, Jorge G., ''Che Guevara: Compañero'', New York: 1998, Random House, pp. xiii - xiv; pp. 401–402. Guevara's amputated hands, preserved in formaldehyde, turned up in the possession of Fidel Castro a few months later. Castro reportedly wanted to put them on public display but was dissuaded from doing so by the vehement protests of members of Guevara's family.}}

*{{cnote|Mausoleum|On [[December 30]] [[1998]] the remains of ten more guerrillas who had fought alongside Guevara in Bolivia and whose secret burial sites there had been recently discovered by Cuban forensic investigators were placed inside the "Che Guevara Mausoleum" in Santa Clara.  Also inside the mausoleum is the original letter<ref name=farewell /> Guevara wrote to Castro in which he stated that he was leaving Cuba to fight abroad for the cause of the revolution, resigned all his party, military and governmental posts, and renounced his Cuban citizenship.}}
