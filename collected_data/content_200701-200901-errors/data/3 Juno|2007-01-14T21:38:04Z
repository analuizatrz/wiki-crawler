'''Juno''' ({{IPA2|ˈdʒunoʊ}}), designated '''3 Juno''' in the Minor Planet Center catologue system, was the third [[asteroid]] to be discovered and is one of the largest [[main belt]] asteroids, being the second heaviest of the stony [[S-type asteroid|S-type]]. It was discovered on [[September 1]], [[1804]] by [[Germany|German]] [[astronomer]] [[Karl Ludwig Harding|Karl L. Harding]] and named after the mythological figure [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], the highest Roman goddess. The adjectival form of the name is ''Junonian''. 

==Characteristics==
[[Image:Moon and Asteroids 1 to 10 at 10 km per px.png|thumb|left|Size comparison: the first 10 asteroids profiled against Earth's [[Moon]]. Juno is third from the left.]]
Juno is one of the largest asteroids, containing approximately 1.0% the mass of the entire asteroid belt. In a ranking by size, it is tenth. It vies with [[15 Eunomia]] for the honour of being the largest of the stony [[S-type asteroid]]s, although the newest estimates put Juno in second place.  Amongst S-types it is unusually reflective, which may be indicative of different surface properties. This high reflectivity along with Juno's high eccentricity (the highest of any known object until [[Polyhymnia (asteroid)|Polyhymnia]] was discovered in 1854) explains its relatively high magnitude and its discovery predating that of the larger asteroids [[10 Hygiea|Hygiea]], [[52 Europa|Europa]], [[511 Davida|Davida]] and [[704 Interamnia|Interamnia]].
It is the main body in the [[Juno family]].

Juno was originally considered a planet, along with [[1 Ceres]], [[2 Pallas]], and [[4 Vesta]].  It was re-classified as an asteroid, with the other three, when many more additional asteroids were discovered.  Juno's small size and irregular shape preclude it from being considered a [[dwarf planet]] under the [[2006 redefinition of planet|IAU classification]].

Juno rotates in a [[prograde and retrograde motion|prograde]] direction, with the north pole pointing towards [[ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic coordinates]] (β, λ) = (27°, 103°)  with a 10° uncertainty<ref name="kaasalainen2002">[http://www.rni.helsinki.fi/~mjk/IcarPIII.pdf M. Kaasalainen et al ''Models of Twenty asteroids from photometric data''], Icarus, Vol. 159, p. 369 (2002).</ref>. This gives an [[axial tilt]] of 51°.

Spectroscopic studies of the Junonian surface permit the conclusion that Juno could be the body of origin of ordinary [[chondrite]]s, a common group of stony meteorites composed of iron-containing [[silicate]]s such as [[olivine]] and [[pyroxene]]<ref name="gaffey1993">M. J. Gaffey ''Mineralogical variations within the S-type asteroid class'', icarus, Vol. 106, pp. 573 (1993).</ref>. The maximum temperature on the surface, when the sun is overhead, was measured at about 293 [[Kelvin|K]] on [[October 2]], [[2001]]. Taking into account also the [[heliocentric]] distance at the time, this gives an estimated maximum of 301 K (+28°[[Celsius|C]]) at [[perihelion]] <ref name="lim2005">L. F. Lim et al ''Thermal infrared (8-13μm) spectra of 29 asteroids: the Cornell Mid-Infrared Asteroid Spectroscopy (MIDAS) Survey'', Icarus, Vol. 173, pp. 385 (2005).</ref>.

Infrared images reveal that it possesses an approximately 100 km wide crater or ejecta feature, the result of a geologically young impact<ref name="baliunas2003">[http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/press/pr0318image.html Mt Wilson Observatory] S. Baliunas et al ''Multispectral analysis of asteroid 3 Juno taken with the 100-inch telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory'', Icarus, Vol. 163, pp 135 (2003).</ref>.

==Observations==
Some notable observation milestones for Juno include:

Juno was the first asteroid for which an [[occultation]] was observed. It passed in front of a dim [[star]] (SAO 112328) on [[February 19]], [[1958]]. Since then, several occultations by Juno have been observed, the most fruitful being on [[December 11]], [[1979]] which was registered by 18 observers<ref name="millis1981">[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1981AJ.....86..306M&amp;db_key=AST&amp;data_type=HTML&amp;format=&amp;high=434a86a7df02503|R. L. Millis et al ''The diameter of Juno from its occultation of AG+0°1022''], The Astronomical Journal, Vol. 86, pp. 306 (1981).</div></ref>.

Radio signals from spacecraft in orbit around [[Mars]] and/or on its surface have been used to estimate the mass of Juno from the tiny perturbations induced by it onto the motion of [[Mars]].

A study by [[James L. Hilton]] (1999) suggests that 
Juno's [[orbit]] changed (slightly) around [[1839]]<ref name="usno1999">[http://aa.usno.navy.mil/hilton/ephemerides/asteroid_ephemerides.html James L. Hilton, ''U.S. Naval Observatory Ephemerides of the Largest Asteroids''] The Astronomical Journal, Vol. 117 pp. 1077 (1999)</ref>, "very likely" due to perturbations from a passing asteroid, whose identity has not been determined yet. An alternate yet unlikely explanation is an impact by a sizeable body.

In 1996, Juno was imaged by the [[Hooker Telescope]] at [[Mount Wilson Observatory]], using [[adaptive optics]]. The images spanned a whole rotation period and revealed an irregular (lumpy) shape with a dark feature, interpreted as a fresh impact site.
