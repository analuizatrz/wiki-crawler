'''''Marvel: Ultimate Alliance''''' is an [[action role-playing game]] released in 2006. It is set within the [[fictional]] [[Marvel Universe]] and features many of the superheroes, supervillains, and supporting characters that appear in publications by [[Marvel Comics]]. 

==Plot==
The heroes must work together to stop master villain [[Doctor Doom|Dr. Doom]] and the group of supervillains known as the [[Masters of Evil]] who plan to conquer the world. 

The missions cover a range of various locations from the Marvel universe, including the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[Helicarrier]] U.N.N. Alpha; [[Stark Tower]]; S.H.I.E.L.D. Omega Base; Atlantis; [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin's]] palace; [[Arcade (comics)|Arcade]]'s Murderworld; [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto's]] realm; [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]]; [[Attilan]]; a [[Shi'ar]] space vessel; a [[Skrull]] world and finally Castle Doom.

==Features==
Players can select teams of four from a range of more than twenty-one playable characters (although some characters are not initially available and need to be unlocked), allowing them to create their own superhero teams or recreate famous teams from the publications. Bonuses are also available if forming certain groups (e.g. the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], [[Fantastic Four]], [[Marvel Knights]]) or a "Femme Fatale" team (using only female characters). The game also has alternative endings, dictated by the number of optional missions the player completes. Also included are trivia, artwork and "simulator discs". The discs unlock non-story related missions for characters and pit them against a variety of villains. Each character also has a variety of costumes that offer different advantages.

==Versions==
The game is available through several gaming systems.

===Game Boy Advance===
"Marvel: Ultimate Alliance" has been altered for the [[Game Boy Advance]] port and has become a side-scrolling fighting game with minor RPG elements, such as the ability to alter your characters' stats. The graphics are simplified for this system and the selection of characters has also been reduced. Some additional gameplay modes were added into this version of the game including a S.H.I.E.L.D. Simulator, Time Challenges, Scavenger Hunts, and a Survival mode. Teams for this port consist of three characters and a striker, a non-playable fourth character who can be summoned to perform a powerful attack directed toward on-screen enemies. 

Playable characters include [[Spider-Man]], [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], [[Blade (comics)|Blade]], [[Captain America]], [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]], [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]], [[Ms. Marvel]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], & [[Thing (comics)|The Thing]].  Special characters included in the game are [[Doctor Strange]], [[Ghost Rider]], [[Iron Man]], [[Jean Grey|Dark Phoenix]], [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]], and [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]]. 

===PC===
The PC version is customizable, and many characters and their skins can be obtained from modding sites for play within the game. Also, the PC version's graphics vary depending on the customization of a user's settings. The PC version also features "intuitive mouse controls" <ref>[http://www.marvelultimatealliance.com/game_info.php Marvel: Ultimate Alliance official site]</ref> and works with a gamepad. A multitude of [[custom skins]] are also available. 

===Playstation Portable===
The [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] version features simplified graphics, different characters, and extra features including the four exclusive playable Marvel characters [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]], [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]], [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]  and [[Ronin (Marvel Comics)|Ronin]]. Other things unique to this version are 6 exclusive comic book missions including one which contained [[Andreas Strucker|Swordsman]], an exclusive prequel mission, and three exclusive single-player gameplay modes. Added features include online play, microphone support ''(voice chat)'' and online-recordable player statistics.

===Wii===
The [[Wii]] version has a few features unique to its version including specific motion-sensitive controls for normal moves, motion-sensitive controlled special attacks (which are unique for each character), and access to any special move at any time. In this version there is no online play, but there is a normal multiplayer mode in which up to four players may play at once. It also features the characters Moon Knight and  [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]].

===Xbox 360 and PS3===
The [[Xbox 360]] version and the [[Playstation 3]] version are virtually identical, with no major differences. 

Activision released 8 additional downloadable characters on the Xbox 360 via the Xbox Live Marketplace on April 26, 2007 in a set of packs: a hero and villain pack, both costing 500 [[Microsoft points]] each. However, if desired, the user may download both in a bundle pack, slightly reducing the overall cost of both separate for 800 [[Microsoft points]]. Four heroes are included, being [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], and the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. There are also four villains - [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], [[Venom (comics)|Venom]], and [[Doctor Doom]]. <ref>{{cite web|title=Activision to Release New Marvel: Ultimate Alliance Heroes and Villains on Xbox Live Marketplace|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/xbox360/rpg/marvelultimatealliance/news.html?sid=6167963&om_act=convert&om_clk=gsupdates&tag=updates;title;1|accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref>

On [[August 19]], [[2007]], a Special Edition Greatest Hits version was released for the [[PlayStation 2]], including the game in its original form and a "bonus" DVD containing a making-of featurette.
