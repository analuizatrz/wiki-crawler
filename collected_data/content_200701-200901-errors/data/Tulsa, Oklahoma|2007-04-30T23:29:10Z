'''Tulsa''' is the second-largest city in the U.S. state of [[Oklahoma]]. It is the [[county seat]] of [[Tulsa County, Oklahoma|Tulsa County]], the most densely populated county in Oklahoma, with 563,299 residents as of the [[United States Census 2000|2000 census]]. As of 2006, Tulsa had an estimated population of 387,807,<ref> {{cite web | url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/40/4075000.html | title=Tulsa (city) QuickFacts | publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] | accessdate=2007-04-25}}</ref> and its [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]] had an estimated population of 897,752.

Tulsa was first settled by the [[Creek]] [[Native American]] tribe during the early [[19th Century]] after the [[Trail of Tears|forced removal]] of the [[five civilized tribes]] into [[Indian Territory]] and what would later become the state of Oklahoma. In the early 20th Century, the city became one of the most important oil centers in the United States.

In 1901, Tulsa was sleepy town near the banks of the [[Arkansas River]].

However, by 1905, the discovery of a large oil pool near the town of [[Glenpool, Oklahoma|Glenpool]] had prompted thousands of fortune seekers to find claims to one of the area's growing number of oil fields.

During the remainder of the mid-20th century, oil profits and an increasing aviation industry propelled the city to another economic surge. The new prosperity led to the development of a master plan for the city, which used a booming economy as the means to fund numerous parks, churches, museums, rose gardens, improved infrastructure, and increased national advertising. During [[World War II]], Tulsa become an important maintenance center for American Airlines and numerous other aviation related businesses that continued to pour money into the city's revitalization efforts.

Econoimic prosperity took a break in 1982, when a national recession greatly effected the oil industry in Tulsa. Areas of Texas and Oklahoma heavily dependant on oil began to see a freefall in gas prices and a mass exodus of oil industries.

Following the "oil bust," the title of "Oil Capital of the World" was relinquished to [[Houston]], but Tulsa city leaders worked to diversify the city from a largely petroleum-based economy to one based on energy, telecommunications, technology, education, and aviation. Efforts by city leaders led to the passage of the "Vision 2025" program in 2003 with the purpose of enhancing and revitalizing Tulsa's infrastructure and tourism industry. The keystone project of Vision 2025 was the construction of the [[BOK Center]] in downtown Tulsa. The multi-purpose arena, designed by famed architect [[Cesar Pelli]], is intended to be a home for the city's minor league hockey and arena football teams, as well as a venue for major concerts and conventions. Groundbreaking on the structure occurred in 2005 and completion is expected in 2008.<ref name="Tulsa Visitors Convention - BOK Center">{{cite web | date=2007 | url= http://ww3.visittulsa.com/general.asp?id=207| title= BOK Center| format=web | work=Tulsa Convention and Visitors bureau| pages=1 | publisher= Tulsa Convention and Visitors Bureau | accessdate=2007-04-20}}</ref>

==Law and Government==
{{main|Government of Tulsa, Oklahoma}}

Tulsa is the county seat of [[Tulsa County]], and has a [[Mayor-council government|mayor-council form of government]]. This form of government has been in place since 1989, at which time Tulsa converted from a city commission form of government.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tulsacouncil.org/about_cc.php | title=About the Tulsa City Council | publisher=The Tulsa City Council| year=2007 | accessdate=2007-04-17}}</ref> The mayor is elected to a four-year term by [[Plurality voting system|plurality voting]]. There are nine city councilors, and each hold a two year term. The city of Tulsa lies mostly within [[Oklahoma's 1st congressional district|Oklahoma's 1st Congressional District]], with its far northwestern areas within [[Oklahoma's 3rd congressional district|Oklahoma's 3rd Congressional District]].
[[Image:Tulsa County Courthouse.jpg|thumb|right|The Tulsa County Courthouse serves as the base for most county government functions.]]
Tulsa's Mayor is appointed by a city-wide election, and each of the nine city councilors are elected from their own respective districts based on [[Plurality voting system|Pluarality voting]]. The present mayor of Tulsa is [[Kathy Taylor|Kathryn "Kathy" Taylor]], who previously served as Secretary of Commerce and Tourism for the state of Oklahoma. Taylor, a Democrat, unseated William LaFortune, a Republican, in April 2006. Another former Tulsa mayor, [[Jim Inhofe]], now represents Oklahoma in the [[United States Senate]]. The city auditor is elected independently of the City Council and Mayor to ensure that the auditor can act in an objective manner. This position serves a term of two years. The current auditor of Tulsa is Phil Wood, a Democrat. The city's legislative body is the City Council, which serves to pass laws, approve the city budget, and manage efficiency in city government. Roscoe Turner of District 3 currently serves as the council Chairman along with Vice Chairman John Eagleton of District 7.

Law in Tulsa is enforced by the Tulsa Police Department, an organization that has about 770 officers as of 2006.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.vachiefs.org/vacp/jobs/vacp_job_Tulsa.html | title=Police Chief – Tulsa, OK| publisher=Virginia Association of Cheifs of Police| year=2007 | accessdate=2007-04-29}}</ref> In 2005, Tulsa's total crime per 100,000 people was 6513.5,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://tulsa.areaconnect.com/crime1.htm| title=Tulsa OK Crime Statistics (2005 Crime Data) | publisher=Tulsa Area Connect| year=2007 | accessdate=2007-04-29}}</ref> which is about 1.5 times the national average.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cityrating.com/citycrime.asp?city=Tulsa&state=OK | title= Tulsa Crime Report| publisher=City Rating| year=2007 | accessdate=2007-04-29}}</ref> The city witnessed 61 murders, 891 robberies, and 6,403 burglaries in 2004.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cityrating.com/citycrime.asp?city=Tulsa&state=OK | title= Tulsa Crime Report| publisher=City Rating| year=2007 | accessdate=2007-04-29}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[Image:Tulsa_skyline.JPG|thumb|left|250px|The Tulsa skyline dominates views from Turkey Mountain.]]
Tulsa is located in the northeastern corner of [[Oklahoma]], situated between the edge of the [[Great Plains]] and the foot of the [[Ozark Mountains]] in a generally forested region of rolling hills. The city serves as the gateway to "[[Green Country]]," a popular and officially designated name for northeast Oklahoma. The phrase stems from the region's dense green vegetation and relatively high amount of hills and lakes compared to that of Central and Western areas of Oklahoma,<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.pbs.org/newshour/vote2004/key-races/ok_profile.html | publisher=PBS | title=Vote 2004: Oklahoma Profile | accessdate=2007-04-30}}</ref> which have geography similar to "[[Great Plains|the Great Plains]]" region. Northeastern Oklahoma is the most topographically diverse part of the state, containing more than half of the state's registered state parks, six of its 11 ecosystems, more than a dozen major reservoirs, as well as the state's most diversified agricultural economy and outdoor sports and recreation industry.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.travelok.com/atv/index.asp#map | publisher=Oklahoma Department of Tourism | title=Oklahoma, The All-Terrain Vacation | accessdate=2007-04-20 }}</ref> The [[Geographic coordinate system|geographic coordinates]] of the city of Tulsa are {{coor dms|36|7|53|N|95|56|14|W|city}} (36.131294, -95.937332){{GR|1}}, with an elevation of 213&nbsp;meters (700&nbsp;ft) above [[sea level]]. 
[[Image:Tulsa satellite poster.jpg|thumb|right|As seen from space, most of Tulsa lies east of the Arkansas River.]]
===Topography===
The city is split by the prominent [[Arkansas River]], which flows in a wide, sandy-bottomed channel. Its flow through the Tulsa area is controlled by upstream flood-control reservoirs, but its width and depth can vary widely throughout the year, such as during periods of high rainfall or severe drought. However, a low-water dam maintains a full channel at all times in the area adjacent to downtown Tulsa. Heavily wooded and with abundant parks and water areas, the city holds several prominent hills with names such as "Shadow Mountain" and "Turkey Mountain," which create varied terrain within the city itself, especially in its southern portions. While the city's central and northern sections are generally flat to gently undulating, the Osage Hills extension into the northwestern part of the city further varies the landscape. Holmes Peak, the future site of [[The American]] monument in the northwest corner of the city, is the tallest point in five counties at 1030&nbsp;ft (314&nbsp;m).<ref>{{cite web | url= http://theamerican.com/location/index.cfm| publisher=The American Project| title=Holmes Peak| accessdate=2007-04-29 }}</ref>

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 483.9&nbsp;[[square kilometers]] (186.8&nbsp;[[square mile|mi²]]). 473.1 square kilometers&nbsp;(182.6&nbsp;mi²) of it is land and 10.9&nbsp;square kilometers (4.2&nbsp;mi²) of it (2.24%) is water.

===Climate===
Tulsa is situated near the heart of [[Tornado Alley]], and has a [[temperate]] climate typical of the [[Continental climate|continental]] variety, with a yearly average temperature of 61°F.<ref name="Weather year in Review 2003">{{cite web | date=2004 | url= http://www.srh.noaa.gov/tsa/2003_year_in_review.html| title= NOAA Year in Review - Tulsa, OK| format=web | work=NOAA| pages=1 | publisher= National Weather Service | accessdate=2006-04-15}}</ref> As is typical for the temperate zones, Tulsa's climate varies throughout the seasons and experiences occasional extremes.
[[Image:Lightning over Tulsa.jpg|thumb|left|Lighting over downtown Tulsa is a common sight in during the spring months.]]
[[Summer]] temperatures of 40 °C, or 100 °F, or higher are often observed from July to early September. These are usually accompanied by high humidity, caused by warm air from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] brought in by southerly winds. Between May and September, Tulsa also experiences an "[[Ozone]] Season", caused by a combination of factors including climate and [[hydrocarbon]] emissions. During this season, Tulsa frequently issues "Ozone Alerts", encouraging all parties to do their part in complying with the [[Clean Air Act]] and [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|E.P.A.]] standards. [[Winter]] temperatures, while generally mild, also occasionally experience extremes below -20 °C, or 0 °F. The [[Autumn|fall]] season is quite short, consisting of a brief period of pleasant, sunny days followed by cool nights. Primarily during the [[Spring (season)|spring]] and early [[summer]] months, the Tulsa area is often subjected to severe [[thunderstorms]], some of which contain large [[hail]], damaging winds and, not infrequently, small [[tornadoes]]. Severe weather is not limited, though, to this season. On [[December 5]] [[1975]], for example, Tulsa experienced a tornado.<ref name="The Climate of Tulsa Country">{{cite web | date=Dec. 2003 |url= http://climate.ocs.ou.edu/county_climate/Products/County_Climatologies/county_climate_tulsa.pdf| title= Climate of Tulsa County| format=web | work=Oklahoma Climatological Survey| pages=1 | publisher= Oklahoma Climatological Survey | accessdate=2006-04-26}}</ref> The spring and early summer [[thunderstorm]] pattern also provides the area with a disproportionate share of its annual [[rainfall]], with yearly totals averaging around 99&nbsp;centimeters (39.&nbsp;in).<ref name=Weatherbase>{{cite web | url =http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=065327&refer= |title= Weatherbase: Historical Weather for Tulsa, Oklahoma, United States of America | publisher=Weatherbase | year=2007 | accessdate=2007-04-26 | language = English }}</ref> Due to frequent [[flood|flooding]] in past decades, Tulsa now has one of the most extensive flood control systems in the nation.

===Neighborhoods===
{{main|Neighborhoods of Tulsa, Oklahoma}}
Downtown Tulsa is an area of approximately 1.4 square miles surrounded by an inner-dispersal loop created by Interstate 244, Interstate 444, and Highway 75.<ref name="Downtown Tulsa Unlimited - Quick Facts">{{cite web | date=2006 | url=http://www.tulsadowntown.org/index.cfm?pageID=7&pageParentIDNew=1| title= Tulsa, Oklahoma | format=web | work=Downtown Tulsa Unlimited| pages=1 | publisher=Downtown Tulsa Unlimited | accessdate=2007-04-14}}</ref>  The area serves as Tulsa's financial and business district, and is the topic of a large initiative to draw tourism, which includes plans to capitalize on the area's historic architecture. Much of Tulsa's convention space is located in downtown, such as the Tulsa Performing Arts Center and the Tulsa Convention Center, and beginning in 2008, the [[BOK Center]]. Prominent downtown sub-districts include the Blue Dome District, the Brady Arts district, and the Greenwood Historical District. 
[[Image:BostonAvenueMethodist.jpg|thumb|left|Located in Downtown, the [[Boston Avenue Methodist Church]] is one of the city's most prominent examples of [[art deco]] architecture.]]
The large area between 61st Street and 121st Street is considered South Tulsa. This area was developed since the 1970's and contains a heavy concentration of chain retail stores, particularly along the 71st Street corridor. Mostly suburban in nature, South Tulsa contains large schools, neighborhood parks, and one of the state's largest shopping malls, Woodland Hills Mall. South Tulsa is particularly hilly and heavily wooded, and holds many of the city's most expensive and secluded homes. [[Southern Hills Country Club]], and [[Oral Roberts University]] are located in the area. East of Highway 169, East Tulsa is an area comprised mostly of modest residential neighborhoods developed since the 1960's. The area contains a diverse racial makeup, including a large [[Asian]] population and a "Little Mexico" district, in which large numbers of [[Hispanic]] immigrants have established a vibrant community centered around the Plaza Santa Cecelia near East 21st Street and Garnett Road. Areas of light industry and manufacture are also found in East Tulsa and the Harvey Young Airport, a public commuter airport, is located on the eastern edge of the area. [[Image:Tulsa_River_Skyline.jpg|thumb|right|The Arkansas River marks the division between West Tulsa and other regions of the city.]]
Areas of Tulsa west of the Arkansas River are called West Tulsa. This area has some of the city's largest parks and wilderness reserves. As a testament to Tulsa's history in the oil industry, West Tulsa still contains several large oil refineries. In an area stretching along and north of [[Interstate 244]], North Tulsa is home to a large percentage of Tulsa's [[African-American]] community. The area's [[Booker T. Washington]] High School, one of Tulsa’s African-American high schools during the segregation era and now a [[magnet school]], was judged in 2005 to be the 58th best high school in the United States by [[Newsweek]] Magazine.<ref name="The 100 Best Highschools in America">{{cite web | date=2005 | url= http://donsingleton.blogspot.com/2005/05/100-best-high-schools-in-america.html| title= The 100 Best High Schools in America| format=web | work=Don Singelton| pages=1 | publisher= Don Singleton| accessdate=2006-04-20}}</ref> Included in the region is the [[Greenwood, Tulsa, Oklahoma|Greenwood Historic District]] and the adjacent campus of Oklahoma State University-Tulsa, the internationally famous [[Gilcrease Museum]], the Tulsa International Airport, the [[Tulsa Zoo]], the Tulsa Air and Space Museum, and the nation's third-largest municipal park, Mohawk Park.<ref name="Mowhawk Park - 3rd Largest">{{cite web | date=2007 | url= http://www.tulsazoo.org/general.asp?id=97| title= Zoo History| format=web | work=Tulsa Zoo And Living Museum | pages=1 | publisher= Tulsa Zoo and Living Museum | accessdate=2006-04-15}}</ref> Many of the city's manufacturing and industrial areas are located in North Tulsa.

The largely residential district occupying land just south and east of Downtown and Uptown from the east bank of the Arkansas River to approximately Yale Avenue and 51st Street is known as Midtown Tulsa. This area, Tulsa's historical residential core, consists mostly of large upscale neighborhoods built in the early 1900s with architecture ranging from [[art deco]] to [[Greek Revival]]. The area contains many of the grandiose estates of former oil barons, including the [[Philbrook Museum]] mansion. The [[University of Tulsa]], the [[Swan Lake (Tulsa)|Swan Lake]] neighborhood, and the upscale shopping districts of [[Utica Square]], Cherry Street, and Brookside are located in Midtown.

==Economy==

[[Image:BOK Tower.jpg|thumb|right| The BOK Tower serves as the world headquarters for Williams Companies.]]
For most of the 20th Century, oil refinery and oil corporations dominated Tulsa's economy. Like the rest of Oklahoma, an oil bust in the 1980s severely compromised that economic foundation. Since then, city and county officials have been leading massive undertakings to diversify Tulsa's economy. Today, Tulsa is still an important energy and oil center, but other sectors have driven economic growth in recent years, such as [[aerospace]], [[finance]], [[technology]], [[telecommunications]], [[high tech]], and [[manufacturing]].<ref name="Work in Tulsa">{{cite web | date=2006 | url=http://tulsaok.usachamber.com/custom2.asp?pageid=1190 | title= Business Opportunities| format=web | work=Tulsa Metro Chamber of Commerce | pages=1 | publisher= Tulsa Metro Chamber of Commerce | accessdate=2006-04-14}}</ref> The [[Tulsa International Airport]] (TUL) and the [[Tulsa Port of Catoosa]], the nation's most inland seaport, connect Tulsa with international trade and transportation. The Tulsa International Airport is also home to a large American Airlines maintenance center, and the Tulsa Port of Catoosa contains an extensive industrial park.

In 2001, with a national recession, the city witnessed an economic downturn similar to that of the 1980's. In response, a comprehensive economic and tourism development initiative, Vision 2025, was approved by voters. The initiative promised to recreate recently lost jobs and rapidly increase job development and economic growth. Projects spurred by the initiative promised urban revitalization, infrastructure improvement, tourism development, riverfront retail development, and further diversification of the economy. The crown jewel of Vision 2025 projects, the [[BOK Center]], is a multi-purpose 18,000-seat arena currently under construction in downtown Tulsa, which was designed to be an architectural icon of the city. Along with other Vision 2025 projects, leaders hope the arena will spur downtown development and tourism. The initiative has led to a significant economic development and investment surge,<ref name="Globe Street Retail">{{cite web | date=June 11 2006 | url=http://www.globest.com/retail/news/midwest/20483-1.html | title= Cap Rates Turning More Investors Onto Tulsa | format=web news article | work=Globeest.com | pages=1 | publisher= Globest.com | accessdate=2006-07-23}}</ref> and as of 2006, employment levels in the city have surpassed pre-recession heights.<ref name="OSU Economic Report - Tulsa">{{cite web | date=2006 | url= http://economy.okstate.edu/outlook/2006/2006%20Oklahoma%20Economic%20Outlook%20-%20Tulsa.pdf | title= 2006 Oklahoma Economic Outlook/City of Tulsa| format=PDF | work=Oklahoma State University | pages=1 | publisher= Center for Applied Economic Research | accessdate=2007-04-14}}</ref>

==Culture==
Tulsa's history has produced a diverse population of southern settlers, northern oilmen, western ranchers, and Native American tribes. The city's culture has been shaped correspondingly by this blend of diverse driving forces.

Tulsa’s culture is apparent in the city’s most prominent art museums, the [[Philbrook Museum of Art]] and [[Gilcrease Museum]]. Philbrook Museum is located in the former estate of [[petroleum|oil]] pioneer [[Waite Phillips]]. Phillips and his wife, Genevieve, donated the 1927 [[Italian Renaissance]] "Villa Philbrook" and its 23 acres of landscaped grounds to the city of Tulsa in 1938. Considered one of the top 50 art museums in the U.S., it is one of only five to offer a combination of historic home, gardens, and art collection.<ref name="The Philbrook Museum of Art">{{cite web | date=2006 | url= http://ww3.visittulsa.com/general.asp?id=149| title= Philbrook Museum of Art| format=web | work=Tulsa Metro Chamber of Commerce | pages=1 | publisher= Tulsa Metro Chamber of Commerce | accessdate=2006-04-15}}</ref> 
[[Image:Tulsa_Depot.jpg|thumb|left|Tulsa Union Depot houses the Oklahoma Jazz Hall of Fame in downtown Tulsa.]]Gilcrease Museum, located in the Osage Hills northwest of downtown Tulsa, houses the world's largest, most comprehensive collection of art and artifacts of the American West.<ref name="The All-Terrain Vacation">{{cite web | date=2007 | url= http://www.travelok.com/atv/urban.asp | title= The All-Terrain Vacation| format=web | work=Oklahoma Department of Tourism and Recreation| pages=1 | publisher= Travelok.com | accessdate=2006-04-12}}</ref> The Museum also offers an unparalleled collection of Native American art and artifacts, as well as historical manuscripts, documents and maps. Themed gardens, focused on various periods of North American history, have been developed on a large section of the museum's property. Another important Tulsa museum, the Sherwin Miller Museum of Jewish Art, located in South Tulsa, contains a large collection of Jewish art and artifacts relevant to Judaism in Oklahoma, as well as remnants of the holocaust. The museum contains largest collection of [[Judaism|Judaica]] in the [[Southwest United States]].<ref name="Sherwin Miller Museum of Jewish Art">{{cite web | date=2007 | url= http://www.jewishmuseum.net/ | title= Sherwin Miller Museum of Judaism| format=web | work=Sherwin Miller Museum of Jewish Art| pages=1 | publisher= Sherwin Miller Museum of Jewish Art | accessdate=2006-04-20}}</ref> Other important museums include the Tulsa Air and Space Museum, the Oklahoma Jazz Hall of Fame, the Tulsa Geosciences Center, and the Greenwood Cultural Center, which houses a historical collection of artifacts and photography that preserves the history of [[The Black Wall Street]] prior to the [[Tulsa Race Riot]] of 1921.

Tulsa's performing arts community has had a significant influence in American pop culture history.

Today, Tulsa contains several permanent dance, theater, and concert groups, including ballet groups, an orchestra group, a chorus and opera company, and several large theater groups. A group called Theatre Tulsa holds the distinction of being the oldest continuously operating [[community theatre]] company west of the Mississippi River and the first community theater in America to produce [[Our Town]] by [[Thornton Wilder]] in 1939.<ref name="Theatre Tulsa">{{cite web | date=2007| url=http://www.theatretulsa.org/history/history.html| title= History of Theatre Tulsa| format=web | work=Theatre Tulsa| pages=1 | publisher=Theatre tulsa | accessdate=2007-04-26}}</ref>

Most of these groups base themselves from the Tulsa Performing Arts Center in downtown Tulsa. “Discoveryland!,” an outdoor amphitheater located 12 miles west of Downtown Tulsa, is the official performance headquarters of the musical "[[Oklahoma!]]"<ref name="Discoveryland!">{{cite web | date=2007| url= http://discoverylandusa.com/awards.shtml| title= Honors and Awards| format=web | work=Discoverland!| pages=1 | publisher=Discoveryland!| accessdate=2007-04-26}}</ref> and holds performances during the summer months.

Tulsa currently has one main amusement park attraction, [[Big Splash Water Park]], located at Expo Square in midtown. The water park features several multi-story water-slides and a large wave pool. Until 2006, Expo Square was home to [[Bell's Amusement Park]], a [[Coney Island]]-style amusement park featuring "Zingo," Oklahoma’s largest wooden Roller Coaster. The park also featured an antique ferris wheel until it was severely damaged beyond repair in a storm in the summer of 2006. Due to its location, Bell's rides were incorporated into the midway during the annual Tulsa State Fair. Bell's Amusement Park was closed following the 2006 season after Tulsa County officials declined to renew the park's lease agreement.<ref name="Rides disappearing at Bells">{{cite web | date=1-27-2007 | url= http://kotv.com/news/local/story/?id=118983 | title= Rides disappearing at Bells| format=web | work=KOTV | pages=1 | publisher= KOTV | accessdate=2006-04-15}}</ref> Most of Bell's equipment had been removed by early 2007 and the owner of Bell's was reported to be discussing relocation of the park with other cities in the Tulsa metropolitan area.<ref name="Bell's looking to move">{{cite web | date=1-27-2007 | url= http://kotv.com/news/local/story/?id=114762

[[Image:BOK_Center-BothRenditions.jpg|thumb|right|The [[BOK Center]] will host major sporting events beginning in 2008.]]
The "Vision 2025" program, approved by voters in 2003, called for the construction of a major multi-purpose arena. The 18,000-seat [[BOK Center]] is intended to be a home for the city's minor league hockey and arena football teams, as well as a venue for major concerts and conventions. Groundbreaking on the structure occurred in 2005 and completion is expected in 2008.

====Green Country====
{{main|Green Country}}
[[Green Country]] is a popular term used in different scenarios to describe different aspects of the Greater Tulsa Region, but may also refer specifically to the official Tulsa MSA. Each usage of the term is derived from its official meaning as the tourism designation for all of Northeastern Oklahoma. Its name was devised in the 1960s by the Oklahoma Department of Tourism and Recreation as one of six travel destination regions within the state, but is the most historically significant of all of them, as the name's usage can be traced to the early part of the 20th century.<ref name="Green Country Reborn">{{cite web | date=9-15-2003 |url=http://www.tulsatoday.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=421&Itemid=2  | title=Vision of the Future Now, Part 3| format=web | work=David Arnett| pages=1 | publisher=Tulsa Today | accessdate=2007-04-21}}</ref> While the Tulsa MSA only officially occupies a section of Green Country as it is defined by the [[Oklahoma Department of Transportation]], the entire region is sometimes referred to as the Greater Tulsa Area. On the same accord, the term "Green Country" often applies to the immediate Tulsa urban area or the city of Tulsa proper, but neither of these are technically the proper use for the term.

Through its entire duration through Tulsa, historic [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] is a drivable road with [[motels]] and [[restaurants]] reminiscent of the route's heyday era. [[Interstate 44]] and the Skelly Drive Bypass crosses Tulsa through midtown from east and west, while its sister highways, [[Interstate 244]] and [[Interstate 444]], make up the inner-dispersal loop surrounding downtown and wrap through the northern part of the city, reconnecting to Interstate 44 in the east and southwest parts of the city. [[U.S. Route 412]] leaves the city from its most eastern and western points, but through most of its duration in Tulsa it is primarily designated as Interstate 244. [[U.S. Route 64]] forms the Broken Arrow Expressway to the east, going as far as the Keystone Expressway to the west. [[U.S. Route 75]] traverses West Tulsa through downtown going north and south, while [[U.S. Route 169]], also called the Mingo Valley Expressway or the Pearl Harbor Memorial Expressway, generally traverses the city in its eastern areas from north and south. [[State Highway 11 (Oklahoma)|State Highway 11]] serves the Tula International Airport, connecting from Interstate 244 and Highway 75. The [[Creek Turnpike]] splits away from Highway 169 from the South and Interstate 44 from the East, bypassing most of the city of Tulsa and the suburb of Broken Arrow, eventually reconnecting with Interstate 44 in Catoosa to the east and Jenks to the west.
