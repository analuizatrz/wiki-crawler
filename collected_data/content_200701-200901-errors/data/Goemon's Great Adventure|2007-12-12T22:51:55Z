{{nihongo|'''''Goemon's Great Adventure'''''|がんばれゴエモン～でろでろ道中 オバケてんこ盛り～||Ganbare Goemon ~Dero-dero Dōchū Obake Tenko Mori~}}, known as '''''Mystical Ninja 2: Starring Goemon''''' in [[Europe]], is a [[video game]] developed and released by [[Konami]] for the [[Nintendo 64]] on [[December 23]], [[1998 in video gaming|1998]]. It is the third game in the ''[[Ganbare Goemon]]'' series released in North America and following ''[[Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon]]'', released two years earlier. Featuring [[platform game|platform]] gameplay in [[2.5D]], it marked the return of the series to a [[side-scrolling game|side-scrolling]] format.<ref name="nponline">{{cite web | url=http://www.nintendo.com/gamemini?gameid=m-Game-0000-120 | publisher=Nintendo | work=[http://www.nintendo.com/ Nintendo.com] | title=Nintendo.com Review of Goemon's Great Adventure | accessdate=2007-01-09}}</ref>

The quirky story highlights Goemon's quest to stop the evil Bismaru, who has stolen Wise Man's resurrection machine. Goemon and his friends must journey through five worlds to battle the revived Dochuki, prince of the underworld, and destroy the captured device. Each world is designed with Japanese styles and themes, and ''Goemon's Great Adventure'' continues the series's tradition of offbeat, [[surreal humor]].<ref name="ignreview">{{cite web | date=1999-10-12 | author=Peer Schneider | url=http://ign64.ign.com/articles/153/153758p1.html | publisher=IGN | work=[http://ign64.ign.com IGN 64] | title=Review: Goemon's Great Adventure | accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref>

Reviewers have considered it the best side-scroller for the Nintendo 64.<ref name="sandiego" /><ref name="npreview" />

==Gameplay==
''Goemon's Great Adventure'' is a [[Side-scrolling video game|side scrolling]] [[platform game]] in which players navigate [[Level (computer and video games)|stages]]. Gameplay in ''Great Adventure'' more closely resembles that of the ''[[Ganbare Goemon]]'' series's [[Super Famicom]] entries, and abandons the free-roaming style of ''[[Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon]]''.<ref name="ignreview" /> Although movement is restricted along a two-dimensional plane, the stages are rendered in [[3D computer graphics|three dimensions]] and frequently wind along the [[Cartesian coordinate system|z coordinate]]—earning the game ''[[2.5D]]'' status similar to ''[[Yoshi's Story]]'' and the ''[[Super Smash Bros. series|Super Smash Bros.]]'' series. The game begins on a [[Overworld|world map]] upon which several circles are placed indicating stages. Players must complete certain stages to open up paths to others, and each world map generally features one town and one [[Dungeon (games)|dungeon]]. Completing a dungeon allows travel to a new world map, but the player must collect several entry passes to gain access to these structures. Passes are rewarded for completing stages and performing tasks for [[non-player character]]s in cities. Though the game is [[linearity|linear]] like its [[16-bit]] predecessors, certain non-linear elements exist—such as a secret village and multiple paths through a world map.<ref name="ignreview" />
[[Image:Goemongreatadventure1.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The protagonist Goemon moving horizontally through a three-dimensional landscape]]
''Goemon's Great Adventure'' takes place in a fantastical version of [[Edo period]] Japan, featuring forests, mountains, dwellings, and [[underworld]]s designed with Japanese themes and a touch of [[science fiction]].<ref name="ignreview" /> Individual stages are populated by monsters, obstacles, items (such as [[Ryō]] currency or [[dumpling]]s), and occasionally [[Boss (video games)|bosses]], who are stronger than most enemies. Players can run, jump, attack with weapons, and use various special abilities to reach the end of levels and gain entry passes. Four characters with three uniforms are available for play, including Goemon, Ebisumaru, Sasuke, and Yae. Characters can be changed in cities or in stages through portals to an interdimensional [[tea house]].<ref name="npcoverage">{{Cite book | year=1999 | month=April | author=Nintendo Power Staff | title=Nintendo Power April 1999 (Feature on Goemon's Great Adventure) | pages=52-60 | language=English | publisher=Nintendo}}</ref> Two players can play the game simultaneously, though they must both be visible on screen—one player cannot advance if the other runs in a different direction. In each stage, a bar at the bottom of the screen displays information concerning character health, weapon equipped, lives remaining, and time of day. If a character is touched or attacked by a monster, a health bar is reduced from a total of three. If all bars disappear, the player loses a life and must restart the stage. The game ends if all lives are lost, at which point it reverts to the beginning or the last point at which the player saved his or her progress with a [[Controller pak]]. Defeated monsters sometimes leave behind dumplings and [[Maneki Neko]]—the former replenishes health, and the latter upgrades weapons up to two levels above starting strength.

''Goemon's Great Adventure'' also features a system of [[day]] and [[night]]. Every two to three minutes, a meter in the information bar will slowly turn to evening or morning; the [[sky]] in a stage's background will similarly emulate the hues of [[sunset]] or [[sunrise]]. At night, more powerful and swift enemies challenge players.<ref name="ignreview" /> However, they produce two Ryō coins rather than one when killed. Different non-playable characters can be found at night in towns as well. Within these cities, players can purchase armor (represented by three blue bars), sleep in [[inn]]s and eat in [[restaurant]]s to recover strength, and perform [[Quest (gaming)|miniature quests]] for entry passes. For example, the character Sasuke must help a man in Spook Village set off [[firework]]s for a festival. Scripted events relating to the game's storyline also take place in dwellings, and occur elsewhere before characters assault dungeons or after these special stages have been completed. The successful infiltration of a dungeon often leads to a battle between three giant [[mecha]] robots. These conflicts pitch the player, controlling the robots Impact and Lady Impact, against a villain and his or her robot of choice.<ref name="ignreview" /> From the perspective of a cockpit behind Impact's eyes, players can punch, kick, grab, or fire nasal and beam weaponry at an enemy robot. Measures of health, enemy health, and ammunition are displayed in the cockpit. If the player's robot runs out of health, the game restarts at the beginning of the battle. To avoid this scenario, players can throw a baton to the other friendly robot; if it hits its mark, player perspective changes to the new robot who has his or her own health count. In two-player mode, one player waits while the other fights, and comes into play if the baton is passed. The penultimate conflict in the game is an Impact battle, and after winning a final fight in normal sidescrolling mode the player can witness the ending of the game.

==Plot and characters==
[[Image:Goemongreatadventure2.jpg|thumb|Ebisumaru takes on some skeletons]]
===Characters===
The [[protagonist]] of ''Goemon's Great Adventure'' is Goemon, a [[ninja]] with blue, bushy hair who wields a [[kiseru]]. Goemon can jump higher than his friends, throw money, and use a chain pipe. Goemon's friends Ebisumaru, Yae, and Sasuke feature once again in the game.<ref name="ignpreview">{{cite web | url=http://ign64.ign.com/articles/123/123758p1.html | publisher=IGN | title=Goemon's Great Adventure (preview) | accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref> Ebisumaru is a fat man with a blue [[Kerchief|bandana]] and a love of food. Idolizing [[James Dean]] as the ultimate ninja, he can attack enemies with a decorative paddle, vocalized rocks, and stomach gas.<ref name="nponline" /> Yae is a green-haired female ninja, or [[kunoichi]], wielding a [[Katana]]. She has the ability to morph into a mermaid in order to swim underwater and use a [[bazooka]].<ref name="ignpreview"/> Finally, Sasuke is a fast mechanical ninja who has upgradable projectile attacks such as [[shuriken]] and bombs.<ref name="ignpreview"/> The villains of ''Goemon's Great Adventure'' are Bismaru and Dochuki<!--(Castlevania's Parody of Dracula)-->. Bismaru, a strange [[nun]] with a resemblance to Ebisumaru, steals Wise Man's resurrection machine to revive Dochuki, an ancient prince of the underworld.<ref name="ignreview" /> While Bismaru fights with her giant robot, Dochuki confronts the party in person.
[[Image:Goemongreatadventure3.jpg|thumb|left|The Old Wise Man shows off his "Ghost Return Machine"]]

There are also several neutral characters in the game.  These include the Wise Man, Omitsu, Edo's Lord and Princess Yuki, and a young cat girl named Suzuka, who assists the Goemon and his friends with information.  Impact is a robot created by the Wise Man (he seems to have been modeled after Goemon).  Miss Impact is a female version of Impact, who was also created by the Wise Man and was modeled after Omitsu. Finally, in every town, starting at Ryo, there is a fortune teller called Plasma. He will give you hints as to the location of every entry pass in the area.

===Plot===
Goemon and his friends must stop Ebisumaru's ancestor Bismaru, the evil floating nun, who plans to use one of the Old Wise Man's inventions in order to unleash another disaster. Specifically, the Old Wise Man (who has appeared in every game in the series) has created a "ghost return machine" that can bring the dead back to life. Bismaru is attempting to create an army of undead creatures for her master Dochuki, the master of the underworld.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://hg101.classicgaming.gamespy.com/goemon/goemon5.htm | publisher=Gamespy | title=Hardcore Gaming 101: Mystical Ninja / Ganbare Goemon | accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref> Enemies like ghosts and skeletons from hell have been unleashed and must be stopped.<ref name="ignpreview"/>

As in previous [[Ganbare Goemon]] games, the plot is wacky and lighthearted. Nintendo wrote that Goemon seems "at ease roaming a medieval Japan bustling with robots, DJs, space ships and extra-hold mousse."<ref name="nponline" />

==Promotion==
Konami heavily promoted the ''Ganbare Goemon'' series for the [[Christmas]] season of [[1998 in video gaming|1998]], as three games were due to be released—''Goemon's Great Adventure'' and the [[PlayStation]] release ''[[Ganbare Goemon: Kuru Nara Koi! Ayashige Ikka no Kuroi Kage]]'' would premiere on [[December 23]], [[1998 in video gaming|1998]], and ''[[Ganbare Goemon: Tengu-tou no Gyakushuu!]]'' for the [[Game Boy Color]] would enter the market on [[January 14]], [[1999 in video gaming|1999]].<ref name="konamipromotion">{{cite web | date=1997-07-29 | title=Konami and Goemon's Three Title Sale | url=http://www.konami.co.jp/press/1998/r.10.12.21.html | work=[http://www.konami.co.jp Konami]|accessdate=2007-01-13}}</ref> ''Great Adventure'' and its PlayStation counterpart were both shown to fans at the 1998 [[Tokyo Game Show]], where children flocked to play them.<ref name="konamigameshow">{{cite web | date=1998-10-01 | title=Tokyo Game Show '98, New Title Announcement | url=http://www.konami.co.jp/press/1998/r.10.10.01.html | work=[http://www.konami.co.jp Konami]|accessdate=2007-01-13}}</ref><ref name="igngameshow">{{cite web | date=1998-10-12 | title=TGS: Feudal Japan Parties In | url=http://ign64.ign.com/articles/065/065249p1.html | work=[http://ign64.ign.com IGN 64]|accessdate=2007-01-13}}</ref> News of an English translation and North American release was first provided by a Konami employee in September 1998,<ref name="ignnews">{{cite web | date=1998-09-21 | url=

==Audio==
''Goemon's Great Adventure'' continued its [[Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon|predecessor]]'s musical style by integrating modern synthesizers and traditional Japanese instruments.<ref name="ignreview" /> The game featured two musical numbers—"SMILE AGAIN", a [[J-rock]] theme song, and "DOUBLE IMPACT", an updated version of "I Am Impact" from ''Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon''. Two performers from that game returned for its sequel; [[Ichiro Mizuki]] voiced Impact's music with [[Sakura Tange]] while [[Hironobu Kageyama]] sang ''Great Adventure''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s theme song. These performances were inexplicably cut from the North American release of the game, leaving the title screen silent and eliminating the Impact battle preparation sequence.<ref name="ignreview" /> Strangely, Japanese [[voice acting]] in the opening and ending scenes was left in.<ref name="gtreview">{{cite web | date=2000-07-20 | author=Edmond Tran | url=http://gamingtarget.com/article.php?artid=1054 | work=[http://gamingtarget.com/ Gaming Target] | title=Goemon's Great Adventure Review | accessdate=2007-01-13}}</ref> A team of five composers created the game's main sound track, each personally writing several demos and arranging finished pieces.<ref name="gmrevolution">{{cite web | title=Ganbare Goemon ~Deroderodochu Obake Tenkomori~ Original Game Soundtrack | url=http://www.gmronline.com/info.asp?CatNumber=KICA-7943 | work=[http://www.gmronline.com/i Game Music Revolution] | accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref> The music of nearly all stages changes in response to the day and night system of gameplay. In normal stages, at night a stage's unique theme slows down and segues into a night theme particular to all levels in a world map.<ref name="gtreview" /> As morning approaches, the evening song fades as the stage's normal theme resumes. In settlements, night themes maintain the arrangement of the day theme, albeit with softer tones and instruments. Music also change within dungeons, usually becoming faster-paced as players advance. One composer regretted that the space limitations of a [[compact disc]] would preclude the appearance of night themes on an official release, and stated that timing the musical changes for the system was a difficult process. Yet another spoke on the style of ''Ganbare Goemon'' music:

{{cquote2|And thanks to this project, I've come down with the Goemon syndrome—the disease most dreaded by composers wherein all the songs one writes are Japanese-style.<ref name="gmrevolution" />|Nobuyuki Agena}}

A few songs from earlier titles appear, including Bismaru's theme and the ending music introduced in ''[[Ganbare Goemon Kirakira Douchuu: Boku ga Dancer ni Natta Wake]]''. A composer who grew up as a fan of Konami's game integrated rhythms reminiscent of [[beatmania]]'s catalogue in a few songs. A 68-track [[sound track]] was released by Konami on [[January 22]], [[1999 in video gaming|1999]].<ref name="gmrevolution" /> The soundtrack was later extracted from [[Read-only memory]] and presented in [[Nintendo Ultra 64 Sound Format]] on [[May 23]], [[2005 in video gaming|2005]]; it is one of the most downloaded releases at USF Central.<ref name="usfcentral">{{cite web | title=USF - Nintendo Ultra 64 Sound Format | publisher=Halleys Comet Software | url=http://www.hcs64.com/usf/index.php | accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref>

==Critical reception==
''Goemon's Great Adventure'' sold over 160,000 copies worldwide<ref name="shrineofdata" /> and received favorable reviews, earning an 8 out of 10 at [[IGN]], a 9 out of 10 at [[1UP.com]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.1up.com/do/gameOverview?cId=3130584 | publisher=1up.com | title=Goemon's Great Adventure (N64) | accessdate=2007-01-08}}</ref>, a 3.5 out of 5 at [[GamePro]],<ref name="gameproreview">{{cite web | url=http://www.gamepro.com/nintendo/n64/games/reviews/40.shtml | publisher=GamePro | title=Review: Goemon's Great Adventure | accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref> and a metascore of 80% at [[Game Rankings]].<ref name="gamerankings">{{cite web | url=http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/915334.asp | publisher=GameRankings.com | title=Goemon's Great Adventure Reviews| accessdate=2007-01-09}}</ref> Critics enjoyed the "simple, yet enjoyable platform gameplay",<ref name="ignreview" /> specifically citing Castlevania overtones and fresh, varied level design as strongpoints.<ref name="npreview" /> The [[2.5D]] system received much fanfare; GamePro stated that it made the game "more exciting than any old 2D scrollers."<ref name="gameproreview" /> Nintendo noted that the game looks "more realistic than any 16-bit platformer, but...plays just like one."<ref name="nponline" /> The presence of a cooperative mode for two players was considered a huge improvement over the game's predecessor, and brought back memories of "classic Nintendo and Konami sidescrollers."<ref name="ignreview" /><ref name="nowplaying7">{{cite web | url=http://ign64.ign.com/articles/067/067174p1.html | publisher=IGN | work=[http://ign64.ign.com IGN 64] | title=Now Playing Vol. 7 | accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref> David Canter of [[The San Diego Union-Tribune]] felt the "ability to control four diverse characters gives the game a nice touch of variety."<ref name="sandiego">{{cite journal | last = Canter | first = David | title = Goemon's Great Adventure by Konami | journal = [[The San Diego Union-Tribune]] | date =[[1999-08-24]]}}</ref> The camera issues found in ''[[Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon]]'' were solved by the switch to the sidescrolling genre.<ref name="npreview" /> Peer Schneider of IGN celebrated the game's non-linear puzzle elements and quests, which made the game require more than a day to complete.<ref name="ignreview" /> GamePro noted that these quests still took place in completed stages, lending little added appeal.<ref name="gameproreview" /> While Nintendo Power applauded the precise play control, GamePro argued that it could have been slackened somewhat.<ref name="gameproreview" /> Canter countered, "control is responsive. A good thing, too, as ''Goemon's Great Adventure'' quickly becomes challenging... The only problem with control occurs when playing as the mermaid...maneuvering a beached whale might be easier."<ref name="sandiego" /> ''Great Adventure''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s graphics impressed critics—Schneider wrote that they seemed "right out of a Kurosawa movie, complete with both Buddhist and Shinto architecture, temples, shrines, tombstones, cogs, mills, giant frogs, statues and more,"<ref name="ignreview" /> while Nintendo lauded the special effects, including "artfully composed cinema sequences...backdrops of glimmering water...and...translucent spirits."<ref name="nponline" /> Canter agreed that while they "don't set a new standard, but there are some nice visual touches."<ref name="sandiego" /> GamePro and IGN agreed that enemy design was generally less impressive, excepting the boss characters and Impact robots.<ref name="ignreview" /> David Canter disagreed, citing "castle bosses, such as the screen-filling skeleton" as "especially eye-pleasing".<ref name="sandiego" />

Several reviewers reiterated concerns over the previous game that the overt Japanese setting and humor might alienate North American fans. One reviewer suggested the game for fans "capable of overlooking some of the games' more inscrutable cultural references."<ref name="nponline" /> Nintendo Power wrote that "the story is a weird mix of sci-fi, Japanese culture and superheroes, but it seems perfectly suited to the game...full of action and variety."<ref name="npreview" /> Levi Buchanan, one of the magazine's reviewers, asserted that the game "radiates personality", while GamePro centered its opinion of the game as very quirky.<ref name="npreview" /><ref name="gameproreview" /> IGN echoed these sentiments, stating that the plot seemed "completely nuts...[yet] somehow fits together to make a highly entertaining and original game."<ref name="ignreview" /> The sound track—"always a Konami hallmark"<ref name="nponline" />—was received well, with critics identifying "that peculiar mix of synthesizer music and old-fashioned shamisen, koto and drum music."<ref name="ignreview" /> Nintendo specifically praised "subtle transitions from day to night and back again."<ref name="nponline" /> Schneider also singled out the Underworld dungeon's theme for praise, remarking that it suited the ''[[Castlevania]]'' style of the stage well.<ref name="ignreview" /> The sound effects of the game mirrored ones used in 16-bit ''Ganbare Goemon'' games, although increased in [[sampling rate]] and variety.<ref name="ignreview" />

IGN's Schneider remarked that ''Goemon's Great Adventure'' would have benefitted from more [[role-playing game]] elements as exemplified in ''[[Ganbare Goemon 3: Shichijuurokubei no Karakuri Manji Katame]]''.<ref name="ignreview" /> He also regretted that the miniature games (''[[Gradius]]'', among others) found in earlier titles were absent.<ref name="ignreview" /> Jason Leung of Nintendo Power wrote upon playing—"finally, a sidescroller done right for the N64."<ref name="npreview" /> David Canter concluded,

{{cquote2|All in all, this title is a solid, challenging 2-D action/platform game for a system that is woefully short on the genre... Challenging game play, above average visuals and a humorous Far Eastern-flavored story line and laugh-out-loud funny character conversations (and the strangest game continue screen to date), make this game the best 2-D platform game for Nintendo.<Ref name="sandiego" />}}

IGN summarized its viewpoints by writing, "two-player co-op, 2D gameplay with 3D graphics, and excellent music make this a much better game than the first N64 Mystical Ninja installment."<ref name="ignimport">{{cite web | date=1999-01-18 | title=Konami's '99 Lineup | url=http://ign64.ign.com/articles/066/066469p1.html | work=[http://ign64.ign.com IGN 64]|accessdate=2007-01-13}}</ref> [[GamePro]]'s conclusion was less favorable, stating that "Goemon's Great Adventure is a bit of a let down...a good attempt at an old-school 2D platformer, but...falls short in many ways."<ref name="gameproreview" /> Nintendo's online review concluded that "''Great Adventure'' is an excellent example of how fun good ol' platformers can be."<ref name="nponline" />
