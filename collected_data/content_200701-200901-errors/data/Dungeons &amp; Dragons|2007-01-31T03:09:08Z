'''''Dungeons & Dragons''''' (abbreviated as '''''D&D''''' or '''''DnD''''') is a [[fantasy]] [[Role-playing game|tabletop role-playing game]] (RPG) currently published by [[Wizards of the Coast]]. The original ''Dungeons & Dragons'', designed by [[Gary Gygax]] and [[Dave Arneson]], was first published in [[1974]] by Gygax's company [[TSR, Inc.|Tactical Studies Rules]] (TSR). Originally derived from [[Miniature wargaming|tabletop game]]s (such as ''[[chainmail (game)|Chainmail]]'') played with paper, pencil, and dice, ''D&D'''s publication is widely regarded as the beginning of modern role-playing games—and by extension, the entire role-playing game (RPG) and massive multiplayer online role-playing game ([[MMORPG]]) industry.

Players of ''D&D'' invent fictitious characters who embark upon imaginary adventures in which they battle fictional monsters, gather treasure, interact with each other, and earn [[experience points]] to become increasingly powerful as the game progresses. ''D&D'' departs from traditional wargaming in this regard by assigning each player a specific character, as opposed to legions and armies. ''D&D'' uses the concept of a [[Dungeon Master]] (DM), a storyteller and referee responsible for maintaining the fictional [[setting (fiction)|setting]] of the game.

The early success of ''Dungeons & Dragons'' quickly led to a proliferation of similar game systems, such as ''[[RuneQuest]]'', ''[[Tunnels and Trolls]]'', ''[[Traveller (role-playing game)|Traveller]]'', and ''[[Arduin]]''.  Despite this competition, ''D&D'' has continued to dominate the role-playing game industry throughout its existence, enjoying a nearly impenetrable market position. In [[1977]] the game was split into two slightly different versions: the simpler ''Dungeons & Dragons'' and the more complex '''''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons''''' (abbreviated as '''''AD&D''''' or '''''ADnD''''').  In [[2000]], the simplified version of the game was discontinued, and the complex version was renamed simply ''Dungeons & Dragons'' with the release of its 3rd Edition. The current version of the game, released in July [[2003]], is ''Dungeons & Dragons v3.5'' (also known as the Revised 3rd Edition or ''D&D3.5'').

[[As of 2006]], ''Dungeons & Dragons'' remains the best-known and best-selling role-playing game, with an estimated 20 million players worldwide and over [[United States dollar|US$]]1 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] (roughly [[Pound sterling|£]]514 million on [[4 January]] [[2007]]) in book and equipment sales (according to a [[BBC]] news report).  Products branded ''Dungeons & Dragons'' made up over fifty percent of the RPG products sold in 2002{{citeneeded}}.  Outside of the gaming community, ''D&D'' has become a [[metonym]] used to refer to roleplaying games in general.

==Play overview==
[[Image:Players hndbk v35 cover.jpg|thumb|175px|right|The ''Player's Handbook'' for ''D&D v3.5'', one of the game's three core rulebooks]]

''Dungeons & Dragons'' is a structured, yet open-ended, role-playing game. Each player in the game typically takes on the role of a single character. During the course of play, each player directs the actions of his or her character and its interactions with the other characters in the game.  As a group, these [[player characters]] (PCs) are often described as a "party" of adventurers.

The results of the party's choices and the overall storyline for the game is determined by the [[Dungeon Master]] (DM), according to the rules of the game and the DM's interpretation of those rules.  The DM selects and describes the various [[non-player character]]s (NPCs), the party encounters, the settings in which these interactions occur, and the outcomes of those encounters, based on the players' choices and actions.  The game's extensive rules—which include guides to social interaction, magic use, [[combat]], and the effect of [[weather]] on PCs—help the DM to make these decisions. In some situations, the DM may choose to substitute or override one or more of these rules.
 
A game usually continues over a succession of meetings among the players and the DM, called a "campaign".  Typically, each player controls one character, although some games allow a player to play more than one character.  The players and the DM keep track of their characters' activities, attributes, and possessions using paper and a pencil (or the electronic equivalent).  The published rules of the game describe how to create and equip a character for adventure, the powers and abilities of the characters, how interactions and combats work, and the many magical spells and items that characters are likely to encounter.  However, DMs are encouraged to modify the rules to suit both their own campaigns and the group they are playing with.

The most recent version of the game's rules are detailed in three [[Dungeons & Dragons manuals|core rulebooks]]: The ''[[Player's Handbook]]'', the ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide]]'', and the ''[[Monster Manual]]''. Additional rulebooks, such as the ''[[Complete Warrior]]'', contain additional optional rules which can be used if the DM permits it. Abbreviated versions of the rules, such as the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Basic Game|Basic Game]]'' boxed set, are available to help beginners learn the game.

The only items required to play the game are the rulebooks, a character sheet for each player, and a number of [[dice#non-cubical dice|polyhedral dice]].  There are many optional items which can be used to supplement or enhance the gaming experience, such as pre-designed [[Adventure (Dungeons & Dragons)|adventures]] and [[Dungeons & Dragons campaign settings|campaign settings]]. Special game boards or cloth mats are sometimes used to visually depict the situations in the game, and miniature figures can be used to provide a three-dimensional representation of the characters.

===Game Mechanics===
{{main|Game mechanics (Dungeons & Dragons)}}

[[Image:DnD Dice Set.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A set of standard D&D dice: (from left) d4, d6, d8, d12, d20, and two d10s, respectively, for percentile: ones and tens.]]
Before the game begins, each player [[character creation|creates]] his/her player character (PC) and records the details (described below) on a [[character sheet]].

First, a player will determine their character's [[Game mechanics (Dungeons & Dragons)#ability scores|ability scores]], which consist of strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom and charisma. Some supplements suggest adding additional ability scores, such as comeliness and psionic ability. This is typically done by rolling dice, but optional methods include a point-buy system or using a fixed array of scores. The player then chooses a [[Race (fantasy)|race]] (species), a [[Character class (Dungeons & Dragons)|character class]] (similar to a profession), and an [[Alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)|alignment]] (a moral and ethical outlook). The player also selects a number of skills to enhance the character's basic abilities.

Some players develop a detailed background for their character (a "bio" or "backstory"), covering his or her circumstances of birth, family, upbringing, nationality, personality profile, moral outlook, and other topics.

During a game, players describe their characters' intended actions, such as punching an opponent or picking a lock, and converse with the DM [[in character]]. Trivial actions, such as picking up a letter or opening an unlocked door, are usually automatically successful.  More complex or risky actions have a chance of failure. Multiple factors may be relevant in the rules governing the outcome of these attempts. These factors include the character's abilities and the difficulty of the task, but the final outcome is typically determined by rolling dice, usually a twenty-sided die.

As the game is played, each PC grows and changes over time as they gain experience. Characters develop new skills, gain (or lose) wealth, and may even change alignment or add additional character classes as they progress. Different PCs will therefore become capable of accomplishing different types of objectives, and the game is designed to reward a well-balanced party of specialized characters.

To represent this process, PCs are awarded an appropriate number of [[experience points]] (XP) when they defeat an enemy or accomplish a difficult task. Acquiring a certain number of XP allows a PC to advance a [[Experience point#Level-based progression|level]], which grants the character enhanced abilities and often permits the player to choose new skills for his or her PC. XP can be lost in some circumstances, such as magical item creation, use of certain spells or powers, or reduced level as a result of resurrection or attack by creatures that drain energy.

If a PC dies it may be possible for the dead character to be resurrected. Alternately, the player can create a new PC and resume playing as the new character.

===Adventures and campaigns===
[[Image:S3ModuleCover.jpg|thumb|175px|''[[Expedition to the Barrier Peaks|S3: Expedition to the Barrier Peaks]]'' was one of the few adventures released by [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]] to include [[science fiction]] elements, such as [[ray gun]]s and [[robot]]s.]]
{{main|Adventure (Dungeons & Dragons) }}

A typical ''Dungeons & Dragons'' game consists of an "adventure", which is roughly equivalent to a single story.  Adventures are usually designed by the DM, but numerous pre-made adventures (also known as [[List of Dungeons & Dragons modules|modules]]) have been published throughout the history of ''Dungeons & Dragons''. These modules allow DMs to run a game without creating an adventure and typically include a backstory, maps, and one or more objectives for PCs to achieve. Some modules include illustrations or handouts to supplement the basic gaming experience.

A series of adventures played by a group of characters is commonly referred to as a "campaign". As a result, the fantasy worlds in which ''D&D'' games take place are often known as "[[campaign setting]]s". As with the individual adventures, DMs can create fantasy settings or purchase one or more of many official campaign settings. These worlds range from magic-rich to magic-poor, from medieval European settings to east Asian realms, from sword and sorcery to swashbuckling adventure to futuristic or post-apocalyptic settings.  A campaign may be site-based, event-based, or a combination of both. For example, in a site-based campaign the players might defend a town throughout a long war and never leave it. In an event-based campaign, the players might pursue and defeat a warmongering villain through several locations over a long period of time.

Popular [[Dungeons & Dragons campaign settings|campaign settings for Dungeons & Dragons]] include [[Forgotten Realms]], [[Dragonlance]], [[Greyhawk]], [[Ravenloft]], and [[Eberron]].

===Miniature figures===
[[Image:HugeGoldDragonMini.jpg|thumb|left|175px|A ''Dungeons & Dragons'' miniature figure]]
<!-- FAIR USE of HugeGoldDragonMini.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:HugeGoldDragonMini.jpg for rationale -->

The wargames from which ''Dungeons & Dragons'' evolved used [[Miniature figure (gaming)|miniature figure]]s to represent combatants. ''D&D'' continued the use of miniatures in a fashion similar to its direct precursor, ''Chainmail'', with each figure representing a specific character or monster. Although the original rules of ''D&D'' required the use of miniatures for combat resolution, the rules quickly evolved.  After the publication of the 1977 game editions, combat was resolved verbally and miniatures were no longer required for gameplay. However, some players continue to use them as a visual reference.

In the [[1970s]], numerous companies began to sell miniature figures specifically for ''Dungeons & Dragons'' and similar games. In [[1977]], the British manufacturer [[Minifigs|Miniature Figurines Limited]] became the first company to partner with [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]] and release miniatures under the official Dungeons and Dragons label. [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~beattie/timeline2.html] Other licensed [[Miniature figure#Manufacturers|miniature manufacturers]] who produced official figures include [[Citadel Miniatures]] (1984 - 1985) [http://www.solegends.com/citadd1/index.htm ], [[Grenadier Miniatures]], and TSR itself. Most of these miniatures used the 25 mm scale, though those for 1st Edition Battlesystem were 15 mm.

Periodically, ''Dungeons & Dragons'' has returned to its wargaming roots with supplementary rules systems for miniatures-based wargaming.  Supplements such as ''[[Battlesystem]]'' (1985 & 1989) and a new edition of ''[[Chainmail (game)|Chainmail]]'' (2001) provided rule systems to handle battles between armies by using miniatures.

''Dungeons and Dragons 3rd Edition '' (2000) assumes the use of [[miniature figure|miniatures]] to represent combat situations in play, an aspect of the game that was even more emphasized in the v3.5 revision. The ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Miniatures Game]]'' (2003) which is sold as sets of plastic, randomly assorted, pre-painted miniatures, and can be used as either part of a standard ''Dungeons & Dragons'' game or as a stand-alone [[collectible miniatures game]].

==Game History==
[[Image:Chainmail 3rd edition.jpg|thumb|175px|right|''[[Chainmail (game)|Chainmail]]'', a ''Dungeons & Dragons'' predecessor.]]
===Sources and Influences on the Development of ''D&D''===
The fantasy game ''Dungeons & Dragons,'' designed by [[Gary Gygax]] and [[Dave Arneson]], evolved in the early 1970s from a naval [[Wargaming|wargame]] system, and certain rules of early ''D&D'' versions reflect this history. The game was influenced by [[mythology]], [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction]], and contemporary fantasy authors of the 1960s and 1970s.

The presence of [[halflings]], [[Elf (Dungeons & Dragons)|elves]], [[Dwarf (Dungeons & Dragons)|dwarves]], [[half-elf|half-elves]], [[Orc (Dungeons & Dragons)|orcs]], [[Dragon (Dungeons & Dragons)|dragons]] and the like often draw comparisons to the work of [[Tolkien|J.R.R. Tolkien]]. Gygax maintains that he was influenced very little by ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (although the owners of that work's copyright forced the name change of hobbit to halfling), stating that he included these elements as a marketing move to draw on the popularity of the work (Kuntz 1978, Gygax 1985).

The magic system, in which wizards memorize spells that are forgotten once cast, was heavily influenced by the ''[[Dying Earth|The Dying Earth]]'' stories and novels of [[Jack Vance]].

The original alignment system (which grouped all players and creatures into "Law" and "Chaos") was derived from the novel ''[[Three Hearts and Three Lions]]'' by [[Poul Anderson]].  A troll described in this work also influenced the D&D definition of that monster (additionally, the novel ''[[Stormbringer]]'' has been cited as an influence).

Other influences, according to the original edition of the ''Dungeon Master's Guide'', include the works of [[Robert E. Howard]], [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], [[A. Merritt]], [[H.P. Lovecraft]], [[Fritz Leiber]], [[L. Sprague de Camp]], [[Roger Zelazny]],  and [[Michael Moorcock]]. Monsters, spells, and magic items used in the game have been inspired by hundreds of individual works ranging from [[Van vogt|A. E. van Vogt's]] "The Destroyer" (the [[Displacer Beast]]), [[Lewis Carroll]]'s "[[Jabberwocky]]" (Vorpal sword) to the Book of [[Genesis]] (the clerical spell "Blade Barrier" was inspired by the "flaming sword which turned every way" at the gates of [[Eden]]).

===Edition history===
{{main|Editions of Dungeons & Dragons}}
''Dungeons & Dragons'' has gone through several revisions. Parallel versions and inconsistent naming practices can make it difficult to distinguish between the different editions.
[[Image:D&d_Box1st.jpg|thumb|left|175px|The original ''Dungeons & Dragons'' set]]
The original '''''Dungeons and Dragons''''' was a box set published in [[1974]] with several supplements and magazine articles of official rules published over the next few years. 

In 1977, TSR released two new versions of the game: ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' (AD&D) and ''Dungeons & Dragons'' (sometimes called ''Basic D&D'' to distinguish it from ''AD&D'', though TSR never used that term).

The version called '''''Dungeons & Dragons''''' (1977 - 1999), by virtue of being published as discrete sets with increasing complexity, was seen as an introductory version of ''AD&D''. Though simpler overall, it included rules for some situations not covered in ''AD&D''. There were five sets ''Basic'' (1977, revised in 1981 and again in 1983), ''Expert'' (1981, revised in 1983), ''Companion'' (1983), ''Master'' (1985) and ''Immortals'' (1985, 1991). The first four were later compiled as a single hardcover book, the ''Dungeons & Dragons Rules Cyclopedia'' (1991). 

'''''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons''''' (or ''AD&D'') was a more complex version of the game in many ways and was designed to collect, revise, and expand on the rules from the original version and its supplements. The ''AD&D'' game was not intended to be directly compatible with ''D&D'' and requires some conversion to play between the rule sets. The term ''Advanced'' describes the more complex rules and does not imply "for higher-level gaming abilities." Between 1977 and 1979, three hardcover rulebooks, commonly referred to as the "core rulebooks", were released: The ''[[Player's Handbook]]'' (PHB), the ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide]]'' (DMG), and the ''[[Monster Manual]]'' (MM). Several additional books published throughout the 1980s, notably ''[[Unearthed Arcana]]'' (1985), included a large number of new rules.

[[Image:DungeonMasterGuide4Cover.jpg|thumbnail|right|200px|First edition ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Dungeon Masters Guide'']]

'''''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition''''' (sometimes referred to as ''AD&D2'' or ''2nd Ed'') was published in 1989, once again as three core rulebooks. The ''Monster Manual'' was replaced by the ''[[Monstrous Compendium]]'', a loose-leaf binder which was later replaced by the hardcover ''[[Monstrous Manual]]'' in 1993. The release of ''AD&D2'' also corresponded with an effort to remove aspects of the game which had attracted negative publicity. This edition removed references to demons and devils, suggestive artwork, and playable, evil-aligned character types (such as assassins and half-orcs).  Aside from these revisions, the rules had few changes except for the addition of non-weapon proficiencies (which originally appeared in 1st Edition supplements) and the division of spells into schools and spheres. In 1995, the core rulebooks were slightly revised and a series of ''Player's Option'' manuals were released as optional core rulebooks. Although still referred to by TSR as the 2nd Edition (in fact, the Player's Handbook contained a notice stating "this is not ''D&D'' 3rd edition"), this revision is seen by some fans as a distinct edition of the game and is sometimes referred to as ''AD&D 2.5''.

'''''Dungeons & Dragons 3rd Edition''''' (also referred to as ''D&D3'' or ''3E'' and not to be confused with the 1983 edition of the basic ''D&D'' game) was released in 2000 following three years of development which began when a near-bankrupt TSR was bought by [[Wizards of the Coast]] in 1997. The 3rd Edition was the largest revision of the ''D&D'' rules to date, and also served as the basis for a broader role-playing system designed around 20-sided dice, called the [[d20 System]]. The 3rd Edition rules were designed with the intention of making them more internally consistent and significantly less restrictive than previous editions of the game, allowing players much more flexibility in creating the characters they wanted to play. Skills and feats were introduced into the core rules to encourage players to further customize their characters. The new rules also standardized the mechanics of action resolution and combat. 

'''''Dungeons & Dragons v.3.5''''' In 2003, the 3rd Edition rules were revised (also known as Revised 3rd Edition or ''D&D3.5''). This release incorporated hundreds of rule changes (mostly minor) and expanded the core rulebooks.

A wide variety of optional supplements have been published for every edition of ''D&D''. These supplements commonly include new rules, items, spells, and creatures. Other supplements include new adventures or detail entire fantasy worlds. The various editions of ''Dungeons & Dragons'' have won many [[Origins Award]]s, including ''All Time Best Roleplaying Rules of 1977'', [http://aagad.originsgames.com/awards/1977] ''Best Roleplaying Rules of 1989'', [http://aagad.originsgames.com/awards/1989] and ''Best Roleplaying Game of 2000'' [http://aagad.originsgames.com/awards/2000] for the three flagship editions of the game.

===Influence===
''Dungeons & Dragons'' was the first modern role-playing game and it established many of the conventions which have dominated the genre. Particularly notable are the use of dice as a resolution mechanic, character record sheets, progressive character development, and game-master-centered group dynamics.

Many ''Dungeons & Dragons'' elements also appear in hobbies of the mid- to late twentieth century (though these elements also existed previously). Character-based role playing, for example, can be seen in [[historical reenactment]] and [[improvisational theatre]]. Game-world simulations were well-developed in wargaming. Fantasy milieus specifically designed for gaming could be seen in [[Glorantha]]'s board games and M.A.R. Barker's [[Tekumel]], among others. Ultimately, however, ''Dungeons & Dragons'' represents a unique blending of these elements.  It created its own niche and led to the development of a multitude of role-playing games. [[Science fiction]], [[horror fiction|horror]], [[superhero]]es, [[cartoon]]s, [[western movie|westerns]], [[espionage|spies and espionage]], and many other fictional settings were adapted to role-playing games.

Over the years, many gamers have criticized various aspects of the ''Dungeons & Dragons'' rules. Within months of ''Dungeons & Dragons'''s release, new role-playing game writers and publishers began releasing their own role-playing games. The first arrivals to achieve lasting influence were the science fiction role-playing game [[Traveller (roleplaying game)|Traveller]], released by [[Game Designers Workshop]] in 1977 and [[RuneQuest]], released by [[Chaosium]] in 1978. Some of the later systems include [[Chaosium]]'s ''[[Call of Cthulhu (roleplaying game)|Call of Cthulhu]]'', ''[[Champions (roleplaying game)|Champions]]'' by [[Hero Games]], ''[[GURPS]]'' by [[Steve Jackson Games]] and ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade]]'' by [[White Wolf, Inc.|White Wolf Game Studio]]. These games also fed back into the genre's origin—miniatures wargames—with combat strategy games like ''[[Battletech]]'', ''[[Warhammer Fantasy Battles]]'' and ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]''. [[Collectible card games]], like [[Magic: The Gathering]], were also heavily influenced by ''Dungeons & Dragons'' and its legacy. ''Magic: The Gathering'' and ''Dungeons and Dragons'' are both currently owned by Wizards of the Coast.

With the launch of ''Dungeons & Dragons'''s [[Editions of Dungeons & Dragons|3rd Edition]], Wizards of the Coast made the [[d20 System]] available under the [[Open Gaming License]] (OGL) and [[d20 Trademark License]].  Under these licenses, authors are free to use the d20 System when writing games and game supplements. The OGL and d20 Trademark License also made possible new versions of older games, such as ''Call of Cthulhu'', using the new system. 

Recent years have demonstrated a trend towards recreating older editions of [[D&D]], in particular [[AD&D]].  [[Necromancer Games]], for instance, has released a series of [[D&D]] products for the [[d20]] system that feature a more rules-lite approach under the slogan, "Third Edition Rules, First Edition Feel."  [[Kenzer and Company]] has produced the [[HackMaster]] line of gaming products, a semi-satirical follow-on to 1st and 2nd Edition ''AD&D''.  In 2006, [[Rob Kuntz]] announced the release of several new "First Edition Feel" adventures under his own system, [[Creations Unlimited]].  In 2005, [[Gary Gygax]] himself took part in the creation of the [[Castles & Crusades]] RPG with [[Troll Lord Games]], which allows for the publication of first-edition D&D products while complying with the [[OGL]].  That same year, Gygax announced the release of [[Castle Zagyg]], which would describe the original [[Castle Greyhawk]], a dungeon referenced in every edition of [[D&D]].  Most recently, a new gaming system, [[OSRIC]] has been released for free on the [[Internet]] which purports to allow publishers to produce new [[Advanced Dungeons & Dragons]] modules while remaining in compliance with the [[OGL]].

==Related products==
{{main|Dungeons & Dragons related products}}

''D&D'''s commercial success has led to many other related products, including (but not limited to) [[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon Magazine]], [[Dungeon (magazine)|Dungeon Magazine]], an [[Dungeons & Dragons (TV series)|animated television series]], and computer games such as the [[MMORPG]] [[Dungeons & Dragons Online: Stormreach]].  Hobby and toy stores sell dice, miniatures, modules and other game aids related to ''D&D'' and its game offspring.

==References in popular culture==
<!--ATTENTION:  PLEASE DO NOT LIST SPECIFIC POP CULTURE REFERENCES TO D&D HERE.  There is a separate article, "List of Dungeons & Dragons pop culture references", for listing specific references.-->
{{main|List of Dungeons & Dragons pop culture references}}
As the popularity of ''D&D'' grew throughout the late 1970s and 1980s, references to the game often began to appear in popular culture.  Numerous games, films and cultural references based on ''D&D'' or ''D&D''-like fantasies, characters, or adventures have been ubiquitous since the end of the 1970s.  Typically, though by no means exclusively, ''D&D'' players are portrayed as the epitome of [[geek]]dom.  References to the game are used as a shorthand to establish characterization or provide the punchline of a joke. Many players, miffed with this stereotype, embrace the fact that the film star [[Vin Diesel]] and [[comedian]] [[Stephen Colbert]] have made their ''D&D'' hobbies public (Johnson et al. 2004).

==Controversy and notoriety==
{{main|Dungeons & Dragons controversies}}

At various times in its history, ''Dungeons & Dragons'' has received negative publicity for alleged promotion of such practices as [[Satanism#Devil worship|devil worship]], [[witchcraft]], [[suicide]], and [[murder]].  Fundamentalist Christians in particular have prominently expressed criticism of D&D. These controversies led TSR to remove references to [[demon]]s, [[devil]]s, and other potentially controversial supernatural monsters from the 2nd Edition of ''AD&D''. In the 3rd Edition, some of the books that contained references to this type of material bore a "For Mature Audiences Only" label, although this is more likely related to some sexually tinted material and vivid descriptions of violence.

''Dungeons & Dragons'' has also been the subject of unsubstantiated rumors regarding players having difficulty separating fantasy and reality, even leading to [[psychotic]] episodes. The most notable of these was the saga of [[James Dallas Egbert III]], which was fictionalized in the novel ''[[Mazes and Monsters (novel)|Mazes and Monsters]]''.  This novel and especially the 1982 CBS [[Mazes and Monsters|made-for-TV movie adaptation]] helped fuel these rumors.

The game's commercial success was a factor which led to [[lawsuits]] regarding distribution of [[royalties]] between the initial creators Gygax and Arneson.  Gygax later became embroiled in a political struggle for control of TSR which culminated in a court battle and Gygax’s decision to sell his ownership interest in the company in 1985.

Early in the game's history, TSR took no action against small publishers producing ''D&D'' compatible material. This attitude changed in the mid 1980's when TSR revoked these rights (even from publishers they had officially licenced, such as [[Judges Guild]]) and took action to prevent others from publishing compatible material, which angered many fans.  TSR itself also ran afoul of intellectual property law in several cases.
