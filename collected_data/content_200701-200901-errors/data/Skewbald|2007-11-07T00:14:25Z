'''Skewbald''' is a color pattern of [[horse]].  A skewbald horse has a coat made up of [[chestnut (coat)|chestnut]] (or any color besides black) and white patches, on top of either pink or dark skin.  Other than colour, it is similar in appearance to the [[piebald]] pattern. Some animals also exhibit colouration of the irises of the eye that match the surrounding skin (blue eyes for white skin, brown for dark).   The underlying genetic cause is related to a condition known as [[leucism]]. 

In [[British Isles]] usage, skewbald and [[piebald]] (black and white) are together known as ''coloured''.   In [[North America]], the term for all large spotted colouring is [[Pinto horse|pinto]], with the specialized term [[American Paint Horse|"paint"]] referring specifically to a breed of horse with [[American Quarter Horse]] or [[Thoroughbred]] bloodlines in addition to being spotted, whereas ''pinto'' refers to a spotted horse of any breed.  Americans usually describe the colour shade of a pinto literally:  black and white, [[chestnut (coat)|chestnut]] (or [[sorrel (horse)|sorrel]] and white, or [[bay (horse)|bay]] and white.<!--note:  Both in the USA and UK/Eire/Au/NZ, "brown" usually refers to bays, not chestnuts, but is actually incorrect in both cases, though where breed registries use the term anyway, they are referring to a specific type of dark bay.  Don't know why, but that's the way it is-->

Skewbald horses which are bay and white (bay is a reddish-brown colour with black mane and tail) are sometimes called [[tricoloured (horse)|tricoloured]].

[[Equine coat color genetics|Genetically]], a skewbald horse begins with a [[chestnut (coat)|chestnut]] base coat colour (called "red" by [[geneticists]]), or some other set of colour genes other than black.  Then the horse has an [[allele]] for one of three basic spotting patterns overlaying the base colour.  The most common coloured spotting pattern is called [[tobiano]], and is a [[dominant gene]].  Tobiano creates spots that are large and rounded, usually with a somewhat vertical orientation, with white that usually crosses the back of the horse, white on the legs, with the head mostly dark.  Two less common spotting [[gene]]s are the [[overo]] gene, that creates a mostly dark, jagged spotting with a horizontal orientation, white on the head, but dark or minimally marked legs.  The [[sabino horse|sabino]] pattern can be very minimal, usually adding white that runs up the legs onto the belly or flanks, with "lacy" or [[roan (color)|roaning]] at the edge of the white, plus white on the head that either extendings past the eye, over the chin, or both.  The genetics of overo and sabino are not yet fully understood, but they have [[recessive gene|recessive]] characteristics and can appear in the offspring of two solid-coloured parents, whereas a tobiano must always have at least one tobiano parent.
