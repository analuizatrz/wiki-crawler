Jackie Chan was born in 1954 on [[Victoria Peak]], [[Hong Kong]], as Chan Kong Sang (meaning "born in Hong Kong") to [[Charles and Lee-Lee Chan]], refugees from the [[Chinese Civil War]].

==Film career==
[[Image:DrunkenMaster DVDcover.jpg|thumb|right|The 1978 film ''[[Drunken Master]]'' brought Jackie Chan into the mainstream.]]
===Early exploits: 1976-1980===
Jackie Chan returned to Hong Kong in 1976 and teamed up with film director [[Lo Wei]], who planned to model him after [[Bruce Lee]] in the film ''[[New Fist of Fury]]''. His stage name was changed to Sing Lung (Chinese: 成龍, literally "become the dragon") to emphasise his similarity to Bruce Lee, whose Chinese stage name was Lei Siu Lung (Chinese: 李小龍, meaning "Little Dragon"). However, the film was unsuccessful because Chan was not accustomed to Lee's martial arts style. Despite the film's failure, Lo Wei insisted on producing films with similar themes, resulting in little improvement at the box office.<ref name="FightingMaster">{{cite web

Upon Chan's return to Lo Wei's studio, Lo tried to replicate the comedic approach of ''Drunken Master'', producing ''[[Half a Loaf of Kung Fu]]'' and ''[[Spiritual Kung Fu]]''.<ref name="Iamjc" /> He also gave Chan the opportunity to co-direct ''[[Fearless Hyena]]'' with [[Kenneth Tsang]]. During the shooting of [[Fearless Hyena Part II|its sequel]], Chan broke his contract and joined [[Golden Harvest]], prompting Lo Wei to use his [[Triad society|triad]] connections to blackmail Chan.

===Success of the action comedy genre: 1980s===
[[Image:Jcpmall.JPG|thumb|right|The film ''[[Police Story (film)|Police Story]]'', nicknamed "Glass Story" for its stunt work, is set in a modern period.]]
Jackie Chan made his first forays into the [[American film industry]] in the 1980s. His first Hollywood film was ''[[Battle Creek Brawl]]'' (or ''The Big Brawl''), directed by [[Robert Clouse]]. Chan then played a minor role in the 1981 film ''[[The Cannonball Run (film)|The Cannonball Run]]'', which grossed [[United States dollar|US$]]100 million worldwide. Despite being largely ignored by audiences in favour of established American actors like [[Burt Reynolds]], Chan was impressed by the [[outtakes]] shown at the [[closing credits]], inspiring him to include them in his future films.<ref name=FightingMaster/> After the commercial failure of ''[[The Protector (1985 film)|The Protector]]'' in 1985, Chan temporarily abandoned his attempts to break into the US market, returning his focus to [[Cinema of Hong Kong|Hong Kong films]].

===Acclaimed sequels and Hollywood breakthrough: 1990-1998===
[[Image:Rumble In The Bronx.jpg|thumb|right|Chan in his [[Hollywood]] breakthrough film ''[[Rumble in the Bronx]].'']]
Jackie Chan regained his [[Hollywood]] ambitions in the 1990s, but refused early offers to play villains in Hollywood films to avoid being [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]] in future roles. For example, [[Sylvester Stallone]] offered him the role of Simon Phoenix, a criminal in the futuristic film ''[[Demolition Man (film)|Demolition Man]]''.

==Roles played==
{{see|Jackie Chan filmography}}
Jackie Chan created his screen persona in response to Bruce Lee, and the [[Bruceploitation|numerous imitators]] who appeared before and after Lee's death. In contrast to Lee's characters, who were typically stern, morally upright heroes, Chan plays well-meaning, slightly foolish regular guys (often at the mercy of their friends, girlfriends or families) who always triumph in the end despite the odds.<ref name=Iamjc />

In recent years, the aging Chan grew tired of being typecast as an action hero, prompting him to act with more emotions in his latest films.<ref>{{cite news
