'''''X-Men 2099''''' is a [[comic book]] published by [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] from 1993 to 1996 that explores the possibility of what a team of [[X-Men]] would be like in the year [[2099]]. It extends the [[Marvel 2099]] [[imprint]], which features other future versions of popular [[List of Marvel Comics characters|Marvel characters]], such as [[Spider-Man 2099]] and [[Hulk 2099]]. The series was written by [[John Francis Moore (comics)|John Francis Moore]], and largely pencilled by [[Ron Lim]].

The series began in October 1993 and lasted 35 issues along with two specials. It spawned a line of [[action figure]]s, mostly featuring the more popular characters in the book, and the planned [[spin-off]] ''[[X-Nation 2099]]''. In issue 20, the title received a minor makeover, officially joining the [[Marvel 2099|2099 imprint]] and changing its name to ''X-Men 2099 A.D.'', the A.D. standing for “After [[Doom 2099|Doom]].” At the series' end, it was folded into ''[[2099: World of Tomorrow]]'', though members of the team were rarely seen after this point.

The first issue featured a blue foil cover on cardstock and the double-sized 25th issue's cover was extra-glossy with foil letters, metallic silver ink, and embossed characters on a heavier wraparound cover.

== The Roster & Their Powers ==
The team featured an ever-changing line-up, but the mainstays included:

*'''[[Bloodhawk]]''' (Lemuel Krug)—extensive physical mutation including tough, scale-like red skin, sharp talons, and leathery wings.  Could transform into human form at will.  Never a permanent member of the team but came and went when needed.
*'''[[Cerebra]]''' (Shakti Haddad)—limited psionic power that allowed her to sense the unique thought patterns of mutant minds, disable the brain of anyone she chose, and trigger subconscious brain functions in others.
*'''[[Junkpile]]'''—techno-organic metabolism increases his strength and durability and allows him to [[psychokinesis|telekinetically]] draw metallic objects to himself and use them to rebuild his body or add to his physical mass making him unusually resistant to harm.  Former member of The Lawless gang.  Betrayed team in second issue but later appointed to new [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] by President Doom.
*'''[[Krystalin]]''' (Ruth Kirsten Porter-Ogada)—pulls [[mineral]]s out of the air and condenses them into hard [[crystal]] shapes of any design.
*'''[[La Lunatica]]'''—[[energy vampire|psychic vampire]] that fed on dark emotions.  Feeding increased her strength and resistance to harm.  Pale white skin and hair as well as red eyes.  Initially an instrument of the [[Theatre of Pain (comics)|Theatre of Pain]], but after her release fell in love with Skullfire and reformed to become member of the X-Men.
*'''[[Meanstreak (comics)|Meanstreak]]''' (Henri Huang)—superspeed and a heightened [[metabolism]] to prevent his speed from adversely affecting his body.  Former '''Alchemax''' researcher and star scientist.
*'''[[Metalhead (comics)|Metalhead]] ''' (Edward van Beethoven-Osako)—skin that could take on the properties of any [[metal]] he came into [[tactition|tactile]] contact with.  Lost the ability to revert to his human form for a short time due to a [[mutation]] caused by the touch of '''Freakshow''' member '''Contagion'''.
*'''Serpentina''' (Kimberly Kristine Potters)—negation field renders her [[bone]]s, [[tissue (biology)|tissue]], and [[muscle]]s [[pliant]] so that she can stretch them to extended lengths.  Killed during first story arc.  Body was reanimated later in series as a barely conscious [[zombie]].
*'''Sham''' (Diamanda LaSalle)—bend nearby light particles and [[sound|sound waves]] into powerful and convincing audio/visual [[illusion]]s.  Joined after she was liberated from the Theatre of Pain.
*'''[[Skullfire]]''' (Timothy Fitzgerald)—ad hoc leader. Initial electrical energy absorption and redirection later developed into absorption and redirection of any energy source; ambient, magical, or otherwise. 
*'''[[Xi'an (comics)|Xi'an Chi Xan/Desert Ghost]]'''—leader. Right hand could break down molecular structures, destroying them, and his left hand later developed the ability to repair molecular structures, although healing was far more taxing on him.  Also generates a protective [[Pupa#Cocoon|cocoon]] during times of self-healing. Former member of '''The Lawless''' gang. Defected to the Theatre of Pain.
