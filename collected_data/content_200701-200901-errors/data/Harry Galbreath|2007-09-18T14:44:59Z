'''Harry Galbreath''' is a retired American football player. Born in [[Clarksville, Tennessee]] on [[January 1]], [[1965]], the 6-foot 1-inch 295-pound Galbreath attended the [[University of Tennessee]] and starred as an offensive guard for the Volunteers.

Galbreath played in every game of his four-year career as a Volunteer (1984-87), which included being in the starting lineup his last three years.  Volunteers' coach [[Johnny Majors]] once said that Galbreath was the best run blocker he had ever coached.  On the field, Galbreath was aggressive and fundamentally sound, while off the field he garnered first-team All-SEC and first-team All-American honors as a senior in 1987.  He also was awarded the prestigious Jacobs Award, given annually to the SEC's top lineman.  In 1991, Galbreath was honored further for his career in the orange and white by being named to Tennessee's 100 Year All-Time Team.

After graduating in 1988 with a degree in human services, Galbreath was an 8th-round draft pick (212th overall) of the [[Miami Dolphins]] in the [[NFL Draft]].  Galbreath was named to the NFL All-Rookie Team in 1988 and played five seasons with the Dolphins before moving on.  Galbreath signed with the [[Green Bay Packers]] after the 1992 season and played three seasons in Wisconsin (1993-95), then headed east to the [[New York Jets]], where he played one more season (1996) before retiring.

Upon his retirement from the [[NFL]], Galbreath was named offensive line coach at [[Austin Peay State University]], where he remained for two years before moving on to a five-year stint in the same capacity at [[Tennessee State University]].  In 2005, he was named offensive line coach at [[Hampton University]], where he has remained ever since.

Off the field, Galbreath is active with the [[National Incarcerated Parents and Families Network]] (NIPFN), a [[non-profit organization]] that provides support and education for families of incarcerated parents.
