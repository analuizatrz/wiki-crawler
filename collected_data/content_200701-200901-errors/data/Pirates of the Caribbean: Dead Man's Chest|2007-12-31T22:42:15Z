'''''Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest''''' is a [[2006 in film|2006]] [[adventure film]] of the [[Pirates of the Caribbean films|''Pirates of the Caribbean'' series]], the sequel to the [[2003 in film|2003]] film ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]''. The film was directed by [[Gore Verbinski]], written by [[Ted Elliott]] and [[Terry Rossio]], and produced by [[Jerry Bruckheimer]]. 

The story picks up from where the first film left off when Captain [[Jack Sparrow]] ([[Johnny Depp]])  discovers his debt to the villainous [[Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Davy Jones]] ([[Bill Nighy]]) is due, while [[Will Turner]] ([[Orlando Bloom]]) and [[Elizabeth Swann]] ([[Keira Knightley]]) are arrested by Lord [[Cutler Beckett]] ([[Tom Hollander]]) for helping Jack Sparrow escape execution. 

The film was shot back-to-back with [[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|the third film]] during 2005, and was released in [[Australia]] and the [[United Kingdom]] on [[July 6]], [[2006]], and in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] on [[July 7]], [[2006]]. The film received mixed reviews, with praise for its special effects and criticism for its complex story and lengthy running time. Despite this, ''Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest'' set several records in its first three days, with an opening weekend of $136 million in the United States, and became the third movie to gross over $1 billion in the worldwide box office, behind ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (film)| The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' and ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]''.
==Plot==
<!--PER WIKIPEDIA'S GUIDELINES AND POLICIES REGARDING PLOTS, PLEASE DO NOT ADD ANYMORE INFORMATION TO THIS PLOT. ALSO, SPOILER TAGS ARE REDUNDANT FOR SECTIONS THAT WILL OBVIOUSLY HAVE SPOILERS. THANK YOU. !-->

The [[Honourable East India Company|East India Trading Company]] arrives in [[Port Royal]], [[Jamaica]] to extend its monopoly in the [[Caribbean]] and purge [[piracy]]. Leading the expansion is Lord [[Cutler Beckett]], a powerful and ruthless EITC agent who arrests [[Elizabeth Swann]] and [[Will Turner]] shortly before their wedding. Beckett threatens to execute them and the absent ex-[[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[James Norrington]] for aiding Captain [[Jack Sparrow|Jack Sparrow's]] escape, but he offers [[clemency]] if Will agrees to search for Sparrow and his magical compass which points to what someone wants most.  An informant in [[Tortuga]] leads Will to the ''[[Black Pearl]]'' run aground on [[Pelegosto]], a [[cannibal]]-inhabited island where Jack and his crew are captive. Jack hid there after he was visited by his former crewmate, [[William "Bootstrap Bill" Turner|"Bootstrap Bill" Turner]], who is now an indentured sailor aboard [[Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Captain Davy Jones]]' ghost ship, the ''[[Flying Dutchman (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Flying Dutchman]]''. Bootstrap delivers Jack the Black Spot, a mark that signifies his debt to Jones is due. Thirteen years before, Jones raised the ''Black Pearl'' from the [[ocean]] [[depth]]s and made Jack its captain. In exchange, Jack must now serve aboard the ''Flying Dutchman'' for 100 years.

[[Image:JackPelegostos.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Jack becomes a native god on [[Pelegosto]]]]
Will, Jack, and the crew escape their Pelegosto captors, unexpectedly recruiting [[Pintel and Ragetti]] as they are attempting to commandeer the ''Black Pearl'', and head for sea. Jack has been searching for a key that leads to limitless wealth, but his magical compass has failed. He agrees to give Will the compass if he helps him find a key and what it unlocks. Seeking assistance from [[Calypso (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Tia Dalma]], a [[voodoo]] priestess, Jack learns the compass will not work because he does not know what he truly wants, or is unable to claim it as his own. The key, Tia tells him, unlocks the Dead Man's Chest containing Davy Jones' beating [[heart]]. When the pain of lost love became too much to bear, Jones carved the heart from his chest, burying it in a secret location. Whoever possesses the heart controls Davy Jones, thereby controlling the world's oceans. Back at sea, the ''Flying Dutchman'' encounters Sparrow, who deviously attempts to barter Will in exchange for himself. Jones demands 99 souls within three days for Jack's freedom and keeps Will as a "good faith payment". 

In Port Royal, Governor [[Weatherby Swann]] frees Elizabeth. Confronting Beckett at gunpoint, she forces him to validate a [[Letters of Marque|Letter of Marque]]&mdash;a royal document with which Beckett intends to recruit Sparrow as a [[privateer]], and which Elizabeth wants for Will. Stowing away on a merchant vessel, Elizabeth lands in [[Geography of Pirates of the Caribbean#Tortuga|Tortuga]] where she finds Jack and [[Joshamee Gibbs|Gibbs]] desperately recruiting unsuspecting sailors in a pub to pay off his debt. A disheveled Norrington also applies. Blaming Sparrow for his ruin, he tries to shoot the captain and ignites a brawl. Elizabeth knocks him out to save him from the angry mob. At the pier, Jack reveals the compass' secret to Elizabeth; it points to what the holder wants most in the world. When he convinces her that she can save Will by finding the chest, she gets a bearing. Once the ship is underway, an attraction arises between Jack and Elizabeth.

On [[Geography of Pirates of the Caribbean#Isla Cruces|Isla Cruces]], Jack, Norrington, and Elizabeth find the [[Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Dead Man's Chest]]. Will, who has escaped the ''Flying Dutchman'' with help from his father, Bootstrap Bill, arrives with the key that he stole from Davy Jones. Will wants to stab the heart to free his father, but Jack cannot allow that in fear of the [[Kraken (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Kraken]] being uncontrollable if Jones is dead, and Norrington desires it to give to Lord Beckett as a way of regaining his rank as well as using Elizabeth's Letters of Marque.  The three, each desperate to gain the chest, begin a three-way duel; the arrival of Jones' crew and Pintel and Ragetti's attempt to make off with the chest further complicate matters. Norrington ultimately escapes with the heart and the Letters of Marque while Jones' crewmembers retrieve the now-empty Dead Man's Chest. 

[[Image:Jack VS.. The Kraken.JPG|thumb|right|225px|Jack battles the Kraken]]

The ''Flying Dutchman'' pursues the ''Black Pearl'', but with the [[wind]] behind them, the ''Black Pearl'' outruns her. Jones ends the pursuit and instead summons the [[Kraken (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Kraken]]. In a moment of [[cowardice]], or perhaps in an attempt to retrieve the heart of Davy Jones, Jack abandons the ''Black Pearl'' in a [[longboat]] and starts rowing back to Isla Cruces; but unable to desert his crew, he returns in time to save them. He gives the order to abandon ship before the Kraken makes its final assault. ‎Realizing the Kraken is only hunting Jack, a deceptive Elizabeth passionately kisses him while handcuffing him to the [[mast]]. Racked with guilt over her betrayal, she tells the others Jack chose to remain behind, unaware that Will saw the kiss and now believes she loves Sparrow. Freeing himself from the shackles, Jack charges the Kraken; the colossal beast drags him and the ''Black Pearl'' to a watery grave.

Watching from his ship, Davy Jones declares their debt settled, although he soon discovers the chest is empty. Norrington, meanwhile, makes his way to Port Royal and delivers the heart and the Letters of Marque to Cutler Beckett in a bid to regain his career. Elizabeth, Will, and the surviving ''Black Pearl'' crew seek refuge with Tia Dalma. She asks if they would be willing to save Jack from Davy Jones' Locker. When all say, "Aye," Tia Dalma sends the crew on their next journey to World's End to rescue Jack with a captain who knows those waters — [[Hector Barbossa|Captain Barbossa]].

==Production==
Following the success of ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]'' (2003), the cast and crew signed on for two more sequels to be shot back-to-back,<ref>{{cite news | author = Brian Linder | title = Back-to-Back Pirates | publisher = [[IGN]] | date =[[2003-10-21]] | url = http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/455/455825p1.html | accessdate=2007-05-12}}</ref> a practical decision on Disney's part to allow more time with the same cast and crew.<ref name="plan">{{cite video | title = According to Plan: The Harrowing and True Story of Dead Man's Chest | format = DVD | publisher = [[Buena Vista (Walt Disney Company)|Buena Vista]] | year = 2006}}</ref> Writer [[Ted Elliott]] and [[Terry Rossio]] decided not to make the sequels new adventures featuring the same characters, as with the ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' and ''[[James Bond]]'' series, but to retroactively turn ''The Curse of the Black Pearl'' into the first of a trilogy.<ref>{{cite video | people = [[Ted Elliott]], [[Terry Rossio]] | title = Audio Commentary | format = DVD | publisher = Buena Vista | year = 2006}}</ref> They wanted to explore the reality of what would happen after [[Will Turner]] and [[Elizabeth Swann]]'s embrace at the end of the first film, and initially considered the [[Fountain of Youth]] as the plot device.<ref name="chart">{{cite video | title = Charting the Return | format = DVD | publisher = [[Buena Vista (Walt Disney Company)|Buena Vista]] | year = 2006}}</ref> They settled on introducing [[Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Davy Jones]], the ''[[The Flying Dutchman (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Flying Dutchman]]'' and the [[Kraken (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Kraken]], a mythology only mentioned once in the first film. They also introduced the historical [[East India Trading Company]], who for them represented a counterpoint to the themes of personal freedom represented by pirates.<ref>{{cite web | title = Everything Relates Back to What Started Everything Off in the First | publisher = Production Notes | url = http://madeinatlantis.com/pirates/production/production2.htm | accessdate=2007-05-23}}</ref>

Planning on the film began in June 2004, and production was much larger than ''The Curse of the Black Pearl'', which was only shot on location in [[Saint Vincent (island)|St. Vincent]].<ref>{{cite news | title = 2005 (and `06): A Pirate Odyssey | publisher = Production Notes | url = http://madeinatlantis.com/pirates/production/production4.htm | accessdate=2007-05-23}}</ref> This time, the sequels would require fully working ships, with a working ''[[Black Pearl]]'' built over the body of an oil tanker in Bayou La Batre, Alabama. By November, the script was still unfinished as the writers did not want director [[Gore Verbinski]] and producer [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] to compromise what they had written, so Verbinski worked with James Byrkit to storyboard major sequences without need of a script, while Elliott and Rossio wrote a "preparatory" script for the crew to use before they finished the script they were happy with. By January 2005, with rising costs and no script, Disney threatened to cancel the film, but changed their minds. The writers would accompany the crew on location, feeling that the lateness of their rewrites would improve the spontaneity of the cast's performances.<ref name="chart"/>

Filming for ''Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest'' began on [[February 28]] [[2005]],<ref name="voyage begins"/> in [[Palos Verdes]], beginning with Elizabeth's ruined wedding day.<ref name="chart"/> The crew spent the first shooting days at [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] in [[Los Angeles]], including the [[interior]]s of the ''Black Pearl'' and the ''Edinburgh Trader'' which Elizabeth stows away on,<ref name="voyage begins">{{cite web | title = Los Angeles: The Voyage Begins | publisher = Production Notes | url = http://madeinatlantis.com/pirates/production/production5.htm | accessdate=2007-05-24}}</ref> before moving to St. Vincent to shoot the scenes in [[Port Royal]] and [[Tortuga]]. Sets from the previous film were reused, having survived three hurricanes, although the main pier had to be rebuilt as it had collapsed in November. The crew had four tall ships at their disposal to populate the backgrounds, which were painted differently on each side for economy.<ref name="plan"/> One of the ships used was the replica of the [[HMS Bounty|HMS ''Bounty'']] used in the [[1962 in film|1962]] [[film adaptation]] of ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (1962 film)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]''.<ref>''Brando's bounty's sailing in.''

The weather also alternated between torrential rainstorms and hot temperatures, the latter of which was made worse for the cast who had to wear period clothing. At Dominica, the sequences involving the [[Pelegosto]] and the forest segment of the battle on [[Isla Cruces]] were shot. Verbinski preferred to use practical props for the giant wheel and bone cage sequences, feeling long close-up shots would help further suspend the audience's disbelief.<ref name="plan"/> Dominica was also used for [[Tia Dalma]]'s shack. Filming on the island concluded on [[May 26]] [[2005]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Beware of Falling Coconuts: Adventures in Dominica | publisher = Production Notes | url = http://madeinatlantis.com/pirates/production/production9.htm | accessdate=2007-05-24}}</ref>

===Special effects===
[[Image:FromRealToReal.jpg|thumb|200px|From reel to reality: Davy Jones is brought to life.]]
The ''[[The Flying Dutchman (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Flying Dutchman]]'''s crew were originally conceived by writers [[Ted Elliott]] and [[Terry Rossio]] as [[ghost]]s, but [[Gore Verbinski]] disliked this and designed them as physical creatures.<ref>{{cite news | author = Iain Blair | title = COVER STORY: 'PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MAN'S CHEST' | publisher = Post | date = [[2006-07-01]] | url = http://www.postmagazine.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=&nm=&type=Publishing&mod=Publications::Article&tier=4&id=04D9DB02305B436E9A74F578F460E476 | accessdate=2007-05-24}}</ref> Their hierarchy is reflected by how mutated they were: newcomers had low level infections which resemble [[rosacea]], while the most mutated had full-blown undersea creature attributes. Verbinski wanted to keep them realistic, rejecting a character with a [[turtle]] shell, and the animators watched various [[David Attenborough]] documentaries to study the movement of [[sea anemones]] and [[mussels]].<ref>{{cite news | author = Rebecca Murray | title = John Knoll Talks About the Visual Effects in the Pirates Movies | publisher = [[About.com]] | url = http://movies.about.com/od/piratesofthecaribbean3/a/pirates080106_3.htm | accessdate=2007-05-23}}</ref> All of the crew are computer-generated, with the exception of [[Stellan Skarsgård]], who played [[Bootstrap Bill Turner|"Bootstrap" Bill Turner]]. Initially his prosthetics would be augmented with CGI but that was abandoned.<ref>{{cite news | author = Jason Matloff | title = Scene Stealer: Stellan Skarsgård | publisher = [[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]] | url = http://www.premiere.com/actors/3851/scene-stealer-stellan-skarsgrd-page7.html | accessdate=2007-06-05}}</ref> Skarsgård spent four hours in the make-up chair and was dubbed "[[Bouillabaisse]]" on set.<ref>{{cite news | author = Sam Ashurst | title = Orlando and Keira: Uncut! | publisher = [[Total Film]] | date = [[2007-05-14]] | url = http://www.totalfilm.com/features/keira_and_orlando_uncut! | accessdate=2007-05-24}}</ref>

Captain [[Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Davy Jones]] himself had originally been designed with chin growths, before the designers made the move to full-blown [[tentacles]];<ref>{{cite news | author = Edward Douglas | title = Exclusive: Pirates' Bill "Davy Jones" Nighy | publisher = Comingsoon.net | date = [[2006-06-12]] | url=http://comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=14949 | accessdate = 2007-05-24}}</ref> the skin of the character is based on a blurred version of the texture of a coffee-stained Styrofoam cup. To portray Jones on set, [[Bill Nighy]] wore a [[motion capture]] tracksuit that meant the animators at [[Industrial Light & Magic]] did not have to reshoot the scene in the studio without him or on the motion capture stage. Nighy wore make-up around his eyes and mouth to splice into the [[computer-generated]] shots, but they were never used, and Nighy only ever wore a prosthetic once, with blue-colored tentacles for when [[Will Turner]] ([[Orlando Bloom]]) steals the key to the Dead Man's Chest from under his "beard" as he sleeps. To create the CG version of the character, the model was closely based on a full-body scan of Nighy, with Jones reflecting his high cheekbones. Animators studied every frame of Nighy's performance: the actor himself had blessed them by making his performance more quirky than expected, providing endless fun for them. His performance also meant new controls had to be stored. Finally, Jones' tentacles are mostly a simulation, though at times they were hand-animated when they act as limbs for the character.<ref>{{cite video | title = Meet Davy Jones: Anatomy of a Legend | format = DVD | publisher = [[Buena Vista (Walt Disney Company)|Buena Vista]] | year = 2006}}</ref>

The [[Kraken (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Kraken]] was difficult to animate as it had no real-life reference, until animation director Hal Hickel instructed the crew to watch ''[[King Kong vs. Godzilla]]'' which had a real octopus crawling over miniatures.<ref>{{cite news | author = Rebecca Murray | title = Behind the Scenes of the "Pirates of the Caribbean" Movies | publisher = [[About.com]] | date = [[2006-11-03]] | url = http://movies.about.com/od/piratesofthecaribbean2/a/pirates113006.htm | accessdate=2007-05-23}}</ref> On set, two pipes filled with 30,000 pounds of [[cement]] were used to crash and split the ''Edinburgh Trader'': Completing the illusion are miniature masts and falling stuntmen shot on a [[bluescreen]] stage.

==Release and reception==

===Controversy===
Walt Disney Pictures has been questioned by the National Garifuna Council, a representative body of the [[Garifuna]] people, for what they feel is a racist portrayal of the Calinago, or [[Caribs]], as [[cannibal]]s in ''Dead Man's Chest''. The Council called for what they considered a fair and accurate representation, and Disney responded that the script could not be altered. No known changes were made to the film.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/.stm | title=Film row over Pirates 'cannibals'|date=[[February 14]] [[2005]] | publisher=BBC}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.seinebight.com/Disney-Garinagu.htm | title=Letter from Michael Polonio to Walt Disney Company-Must Read | publisher=Seine Bight | author=Michael Polonio | accessdate=}}</ref>
