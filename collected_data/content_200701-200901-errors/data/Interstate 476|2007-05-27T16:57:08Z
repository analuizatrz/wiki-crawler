'''Interstate 476''' is a 132&nbsp;mile long<ref name="Blue Route" /><ref name="tollmileage" /> [[Interstate Highway]] that travels between [[Interstate 95]] near [[Chester, Pennsylvania]] and [[Interstate 81]] near [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], serving as the primary north-south Interstate corridor through eastern [[Pennsylvania]]. It consists of both the approximately 21&nbsp;mile<ref name="Blue Route" />'''Mid-County Expressway''', locally referred to as the "'''Blue Route'''," through the suburban [[Philadelphia]] counties of [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware]] and [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery]], and the 110&nbsp;mile<ref name="tollmileage" /> '''Northeast Extension''' of the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] connecting the Philadelphia metropolitan area with the [[Lehigh Valley]], the [[Poconos]], and the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]]-[[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]] metropolitan area.

While proposed as early as [[1929]], the construction of the Mid-County Expressway through Delaware County, Pennsylvania was not completed until [[1992]] due to massive community and environmental opposition during the [[freeway revolts]] of the 1960s and 1970s, leading ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' to dub it "the most costly, most bitterly opposed highway in Pennsylvania history."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/byday/fhbd1219.htm|title=FHWA By Day - December 19|accessdate=2007-03-07}}</ref>

Following the completion of the Mid-County Expressway, in [[1996]] the Interstate 476 designation was extended to include the entire length of the existing Northeast Extension. Since the extension, I-476 has been the longest auxiliary [[Interstate highway]] in the [[United States]].

===Chester to Plymouth Meeting===
The portion of Interstate 476 between [[Interstate 95]] and [[Interstate 276]], running north-south through [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania]], is officially known as the '''Mid-County Expressway''' and the '''Veterans Memorial Highway''', as well as by its ubiquitous nickname, the '''Blue Route'''. The road begins at Interstate 95 near the southwest [[Philadelphia]] suburb of [[Chester, Pennsylvania|Chester]], near [[Philadelphia International Airport]].

Heading north, the road immediately narrows to a four-lane parkway north of Exit 1, a reduced design built due to local environmental concerns.<ref name="phillyroads">{{cite web|url=http://www.phillyroads.com/roads/blue-route/|title=The Roads of Metro Philadelphia: Mid-County Expressway ("Blue Route")|accessdate=2007-03-07}}</ref> The route winds through the western [[Philadelphia]] suburbs of [[Wallingford, Pennsylvania|Wallingford]], [[Swarthmore, Pennsylvania|Swarthmore]], and [[Springfield, Pennsylvania|Springfield]], meeting [[U.S. Route 1]] at a massive [[three-level diamond interchange]] (also called a "volleyball interchange").

At [[Pennsylvania Route 3]], the route widens to six lanes, bisecting the famous [[Main Line]] at [[U.S. Route 30]], and interchanging with the [[Interstate 76]], the [[Schuylkill Expressway]], at [[Conshohocken, Pennsylvania|Conshohocken]]. After crossing the [[Schuylkill River]], the freeway comes to an end at the Mid-County toll barrier with the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] in [[Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania|Plymouth Meeting]].<ref name="pamap">{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_PDF_FILES/MAPS/Statewide/otm/2006/otm_2006.PDF|title=Pennsylvania Official Tourism and Transportation Map 2006|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-03-07}}</ref>

===Plymouth Meeting to Clarks Summit===
Beyond the toll barrier, Interstate 476 enters the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] system, interchanging with [[Interstate 276]] and continuing north as the '''Northeast Extension''' of the Pennsylvania Turnpike. The route continues through the Philadelphia suburbs, past [[Lansdale, Pennsylvania|Lansdale]] and [[Quakertown, Pennsylvania|Quakertown]], and into the [[Lehigh Valley]] metropolitan area. It interchanges with [[U.S. Route 22]] near [[Allentown]], which also offers an indirect connection to [[Pennsylvania Route 309]] and [[Interstate 78]].

North of Allentown, the route enters the [[Poconos]], tunneling underneath [[Blue Mountain (Pennsylvania)|Blue Mountain]], and meeting [[U.S. Route 209]] near [[Lehighton, Pennsylvania|Lehighton]]. Continuing through the mountains, it cuts through [[Hickory Run State Park]], interchanging with [[Interstate 80]] on the perimeter on its way to the end of the toll ticket system at [[Bear Creek, Pennsylvania]].

North of the toll barrier, the route meets [[Pennsylvania Route 115]], which provides access to nearby [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]]. Near [[Pittston, Pennsylvania|Pittston]], an interchange provides an indirect connection to [[Interstate 81]] through [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]]. The route then crosses the [[Wyoming Valley]] and skirts around Scranton, with an exit to local Keyser Avenue. North of Scranton, the route comes to an abrupt end at a hairpin curve in [[Clarks Summit, Pennsylvania|Clarks Summit]], with connections to [[Interstate 81]], [[U.S. Route 6]] and [[U.S. Route 11]].<ref name="pamap"/>

== History ==
=== Mid-County Expressway ===
Originally planned as far back as 1929, the Mid-County Expressway was later proposed by the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission]] as the "Chester Extension" of the Pennsylvania Turnpike in 1954. After the advent of the [[Interstate Highway System]], the project was transferred to the [[Pennsylvania Department of Transportation|Pennsylvania Department of Highways]] to be built as part of the system, designating it first as '''Interstate 495''', and later as '''Interstate 480''', as I-76 was designated as I-80S at the time. The present-day I-476 designation was assigned in 1964 when I-80S was renumbered as I-76.<ref name="phillyroads"/>

[[Image:I-476 Blue Route Map.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A 1960 map of central [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware County]], oriented with east on top, outlining the proposed corridors of the Mid-County Expressway.]]The road received its ubiquitous nickname from a 1958 location report indicating various proposed geographic configurations of an expressway through [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware County]] with lines of various colors on a map. The "blue route" through the [[Crum Creek]] valley won out over other contenders, which included a more easterly "red route" and "yellow route" and a more westerly "green route".<ref name="phillyroads"/>

As one of the most controversial Interstate Highways in Pennsylvania, construction of I-476 began in 1967, but was not completed until 1991 between MacDade Blvd.(Exit 1) and Interstate 76(Exit 16), and until 1992 between Germantown Pike east/Chemical Rd.(Exit 19) and Interstate 276 (PA Turnpike), due to litigation between the [[Pennsylvania Department of Transportation]] and several communities in the road's path over environmental concerns. However, the section of Interstate 476(south end of I-476) between I-95 and MacDade Blvd.(Exit 1) was opened in 1987, but the signs refer to as "To MacDade Blvd" until 1991 when I-476/The Blue Route was opened between Exits 1 and 16. An agreement in 1985 led to many environmental compromises in the road's design, including a downsized four-lane design south of [[Pennsylvania Route 3]], [[ramp meter]]s, and federal scenic route status, prohibiting the erection of advertisement billboards along the entire freeway portion. While the redesigned highway was largely well-received, the constriction to four lanes has led to bottleneck conditions in the area, and many communities that originally opposed the road have now called for its widening.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asphaltinstitute.org/upload/Summer_1997.pdf|title=Asphalt: the Magazine of the Asphalt Institute, Summer 1997|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-03-07}}</ref>

The road is [[As of 2007|currently]] undergoing a complete rehabilitation project, including paving, bridge repair, and ramp maintenance of the entire length of the freeway between [[Interstate 95]] and the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.476blueroute.com/|title=I-476 Improvement Project|accessdate=2007-03-07}}</ref>

=== Northeast Extension ===
[[Image:I-476 Exit 44.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Approaching exit 44 ([[Pennsylvania Route 663|PA 663]]).]] The Northeast Extension of the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] system opened in stages from November 23, 1955 to November 7, 1957, and was originally designated '''Pennsylvania Route 9'''.

The hairpin curve at the highway's northern terminus was designed to allow for expansion northward to the [[New York]] state line. However, as with the Chester Extension to the south, it was decided to incorporate this segment as part of [[Interstate 81]] following the advent of the Interstate system.

The highway includes a major, 4,461-foot tunnel through [[Blue Mountain (Pennsylvania)|Blue Mountain]] known as the '''Lehigh Tunnel'''. The tunnel was named as such so as not to cause confusion with the existing Blue Mountain tunnel on the mainline. The tunnel was originally to be named for Turnpike Commission chairman Thomas J. Evans, but this was changed due to his [[July 25]], [[1967]] conviction for conspiracy to defraud the Turnpike Commission of $19 million. The Lehigh Tunnel was originally a two-lane tunnel in the manner of the mainline turnpike's original seven tunnels, until it was "twinned" in the early 1990s.<ref name="pahighwaystpk">{{cite web|url=http://www.pahighways.com/toll/PATurnpike.html|title=Pennsylvania Highways: Pennsylvania Turnpike|accessdate=2007-03-07}}</ref>

In 1996, after the expansion of the Lehigh Tunnel and the completion of the I-276/I-476/PA 9 interchange, the I-476 designation was extended up the entire length of the Northeast Extension, supplanting the PA 9 designation. This extension resulted in I-476 surpassing the 120&nbsp;mile [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 495]] in [[Massachusetts]] as the longest auxiliary Interstate highway.<ref name="kurumi">{{cite web|url=http://www.kurumi.com/roads/3di/ix76.html#476pa|title=3 Digit Interstates at kurumi.com: I-76|accessdate=2007-03-07}}</ref>

PennDOT is in the preliminary stages of planning the widening of the Northeast Extension from Mid-County to Lansdale from 4 lanes to 6.<ref name="neextwidening">{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc10.com/news/11605582/detail.html|title=Northeast Extension Plans Open To Public Monday Night at nbc10.com|accessdate=2007-04-19}}</ref>
