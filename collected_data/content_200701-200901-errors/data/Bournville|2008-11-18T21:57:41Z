'''Bournville''' is a [[model village]] on the south side of [[Birmingham]], [[England]], best known for its connections with the [[Cadbury]] family and [[chocolate]] - including a dark chocolate bar branded "Bournville". It is also a [[ward (politics)|ward]] within the [[Government of Birmingham, England#Districts|council constituency]] of [[Selly Oak]] and home to a campus of the [[Birmingham Institute of Art and Design]]. Research by the [[Joseph Rowntree Foundation]] has claimed that it is "one of the nicest places to live in Britain".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3056286.stm Is this the nicest place to live in Britain?], BBC News, 2003</ref>

==History==
Originally, Bournville consisted of a scattering of farmsteads and cottages linked by winding country lanes, the only visual highlight being the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] built Bournbrook Hall.

The [[Bluebell wood|bluebell glades]] of Stocks Wood were said to be a relic of the [[Forest of Arden]] and there are [[Roman Empire|Roman]] remains nearby.

===Cadbury===
In 1879, [[George Cadbury|George]] and [[Richard Cadbury]] moved their [[cocoa]] and chocolate factory from Bridge Street in central Birmingham to a greenfield site beside Bournbrook Hall, four miles (6 km) to the south. The location was chosen as it was regarded as cleaner, healthier and more amenable to longer-term expansion plans. Although rural, it was also already serviced by [[Bournville railway station]] and a [[canal]].

The Cadburys named the area 'Bournville' after the [[Bourn Brook]] (now known as The Bourn); with 'ville' being French for 'town', this set Bournville apart from the local area (some people wrongly believe Bournville was originally known as Bournbrook - [[Bournbrook]] exists as a separate area to the north of Bournville). The Cadburys began to develop their factory in the new suburb. Loyal and hard-working workers were treated with great respect and relatively high wages and good working conditions; Cadbury also pioneered [[pension]] schemes, joint works committees and a full staff medical service.  

In 1893 George Cadbury bought 120 acres (0.5 km²) of land close to the works and planned, at his own expense, a [[model village]] which would 'alleviate the evils of modern more cramped living conditions'. By 1900 the estate included 313 cottages and houses set on {{convert|330|acre|km2}} of land, and many more similar properties were built in the years leading up to the [[World War I]], with smaller developments taking place later on in the 20th century. These almost '[[Arts and crafts]]' houses were traditional in design but with large gardens and modern interiors, and were designed by the resident [[architect]] [[William Alexander Harvey]]. These designs became a blueprint for many other model village estates around Britain. It is also noteworthy that, because George Cadbury was a [[Quaker]], no [[public house]]s have ever been built in Bournville, although since the late 1940s there has been a licensed members bar at Rowheath Pavilion.

The Cadburys were particularly concerned with the health and fitness of their workforce, incorporating park and recreation areas into the Bournville village plans, and encouraging [[swimming]], [[walking]] and indeed all forms of outdoor sports. In the early 1920s extensive open lands were purchased at Rowheath and laid to [[soccer]] and [[hockey]] pitches together with a grassed running track. Rowheath Pavilion was designed and built in accordance with the instructions of George Cadbury, and opened in July 1924. At that time it served as the clubhouse and changing rooms for the acres of sports playing fields, several bowling greens, a fishing lake and an outdoor swimming Lido, a natural mineral spring forming the source for the lido's healthy waters. The Rowheath Pavilion itself, which still exists, was used for balls and dinners, and the whole area was specifically for the benefit of the Cadbury workers and their families with no charges for the use of any of the sporting facilities by Cadbury employees or their families. The lido was eventually closed in the 1970s after complaints of noise disturbance were made by residents of the newly built Oak Farm estate, coupled with new and stringent health and safety regulations relating to outdoor public swimming facilities. Cadbury's also built the Bournville indoor swimming baths on Bournville Lane, the Valley pool boating lake and the picturesque cricket pitch adjacent to the factory site, that was made famous as the picture on boxes of Milk Tray chocolates throughout the 1950s and 1960s. 

[[Image:Bournville Rest House -2Oct2005.jpg|thumb|left|Bournville Rest House was built to celebrate the Silver Wedding Anniversary of George and Elizabeth Cadbury, and was paid for by the employees of Cadbury Brothers Ltd. The design is by [[William Alexander Harvey]], who was architect of many of the buildings on the estate and is based on the 17th century Yarn Market in [[Dunster]], [[Somerset]]. Currently, the building houses the Visitors Centre for the [[Carillon]].]]

In 1900, the [[Bournville Village Trust]] was set up to formally control the development of the estate, independently of George Cadbury or the Cadbury company. The trust focused on providing [[school]]s, [[hospital]]s, [[museum]]s, public baths and reading rooms. As Bournville is a conservation area, another job of the Bournville Village Trust is to accept or reject plans for building extension and modification.

An almost campus feel evolved, with a triangular village green, infant and junior schools, the School of Art and the Day Continuation School (originally intended for young Cadbury employees) and a host of events such as fêtes and [[Maypole]] dances.

The trust continues to exercise an international influence on housing and town planning generally. Now containing 7,800 homes on 1,000 acres (4 km²) of land with 100 acres (0.4 km²) of parks and open spaces, Bournville remains a popular residential area of Birmingham.

[[Cadbury Schweppes]] is still one of Birmingham's main employers, making all manner of chocolate products.

The dark chocolate Bournville Plain is now manufactured in France and sold in the UK.

==Governance==
