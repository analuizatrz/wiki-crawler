'''Infrared''' ('''IR''') radiation is [[electromagnetic radiation]] of a [[wavelength]] longer than that of [[visible light]], but shorter than that of [[radio waves]]. The name means "below [[red]]" (from the [[Latin]] ''infra'', "below"), red being the [[color]] of visible [[light]] of longest wavelength. Infrared radiation spans three orders of magnitude and has wavelengths between approximately [[1 E-7 m|750]]&nbsp;[[Nanometre|nm]] and 1&nbsp;[[millimetre|mm]].<ref>{{cite web | author = Dr. S. C.

The infrared portion of the spectrum has a number of technological uses, including target acquisition and tracking by the military; remote temperature sensing; short-ranged wireless communication; [[spectroscopy]], and weather forecasting. [[Telescope]]s equipped with infrared sensors are used in [[infrared astronomy]] to penetrate dusty regions of space, such as [[molecular cloud]]s; detect low temperature objects such as [[planet]]s orbiting distant [[star]]s, and to view highly [[Redshift|red-shifted]] objects from the early history of the [[universe]].<ref name="ir_astronomy">{{cite web | url = http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/Outreach/Edu/importance.html | title = IR Astronomy: Overview | publisher = NASA Infrared Astronomy and Processing Center | language = English | accessdate = 2006-10-30 }}</ref>

At the atomic level, infrared energy elicits [[vibration]]al modes in a [[molecule]] through a change in the [[dipole moment]], making it a useful frequency range for study of these energy states. [[Infrared spectroscopy]] is the examination of absorption and transmission of [[photon]]s in the infrared energy range, based on their frequency and intensity.<ref>{{cite web | last = Reusch | first = William | year = 1999 | url = http://www.cem.msu.edu/~reusch/VirtualText/Spectrpy/InfraRed/infrared.htm | title = Infrared Spectroscopy | publisher = Michigan State University | accessdate = 2006-10-27 }}</ref>

==Different regions in the infrared==
{{unreferenced|date=July 2006}}
The infrared band is often subdivided into smaller sections but the divisions are not precise, and are used differently by different authors. 
----
One such scheme is:
*near infrared ('''NIR''', IR-A ''[[DIN]]''): 0.75–1.4&nbsp;[[micrometre|µm]] in wavelength, defined by the water absorption, and commonly used in [[fiber optic]] telecommunication because of low attenuation losses in the SiO<sub>2</sub> glass ([[silica]]) medium.
*short wavelength IR ('''SWIR''', IR-B ''DIN''): 1.4–3&nbsp;µm, water absorption increases significantly at 1450&nbsp;nm. The 1530 to 1560&nbsp;nm range is the dominant spectral region for long-distance telecommunications.
*mid wavelength IR ('''MWIR''', IR-C ''DIN'') also intermediate-IR (IIR): 3–8&nbsp;µm
*long wavelength IR ('''LWIR''', IR-C ''DIN''): 8&ndash;15&nbsp;µm
*far infrared ('''FIR'''): 15–1,000&nbsp;µm (see also [[far infrared laser]])
NIR and SWIR is sometimes called ''Reflected Infrared'' while MWIR and LWIR is sometimes referred to as ''Thermal Infrared''.
----
Another common scheme is:
*'''near''': 0.75–5&nbsp;µm
*'''mid''': 5–30&nbsp;µm
*'''long''': 30–1,000&nbsp;µm
----
A third scheme divides up the band based on the response of various detectors<ref name="Miller">Miller, ''Principles of Infrared Technology'' (Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1992), and Miller and Friedman, ''Photonic Rules of Thumb'', 2004.</ref>:
*Near IR ('''NIR'''): from 0.7 to 1.0 [[micrometre|micrometers]] (from the approximate end of the response of the human eye to that of silicon)
*Short-wave infrared ('''SWIR'''): 1.0 to 3 micrometers (from the cut off of silicon to that of the MWIR atmospheric window. InGaAs covers to about 1.8 micrometers; the less sensitive lead salts cover this region
*Mid-wave infrared ('''MWIR'''): 3 to 5 micrometers (defined by the atmospheric window and covered by InSb and HgCdTe and partially PbSe) 
*Long-wave infrared ('''LWIR'''): 8 to 12, or 7 to 14 micrometers: the atmospheric window (Covered by HgCdTe and [[microbolometer]]s)
*Very-long wave infrared ('''VLWIR'''): 12 to about 30 micrometers, covered by doped silicon 
----
[[Image:Atmospheric transmittance infrared.gif|right|frame|Plot of atmospheric transmittance in part of the infrared region.]]
These divisions are justified by the different human response to this radiation: near infrared is the region closest in wavelength to the radiation detectable by the human eye, mid and far infrared are progressively further from the [[visible spectrum|visible regime]]. Other definitions follow different physical mechanisms (emission peaks, vs. bands, water absorption) and the newest follow technical reasons (The common [[silicon]] detectors are sensitive to about 1,050&nbsp;nm, while [[indium gallium arsenide|InGaAs]] sensitivity starts around 950&nbsp;nm and ends between 1,700 and 2,600&nbsp;nm, depending on the specific configuration). Unfortunately, international standards for these specifications are not currently available.

The boundary between visible and infrared light is not precisely defined. The human [[eye]] is markedly less sensitive to light above 700 nm wavelength, so longer frequencies make insignificant contributions to scenes illuminated by common light sources.  But particularly intense light (e.g., from [[laser]]s, or from bright daylight with the visible light removed by coloured gels[http://amasci.com/amateur/irgoggl.html]) can be detected up to approximately 780 nm, and will be perceived as red light. The onset of infrared is defined (according to different standards) at various values typically between 700 nm and 780 nm.

===Telecommunication bands in the infrared===
In [[optical communications]], the part of the infrared spectrum that is used is divided into several bands based on availability of light sources, transmitting/absorbing materials (fibers) and detectors:<ref>{{cite web | last = Ramaswami | first = Rajiv | date = May, 2002 | url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/35/21724/01006983.pdf | title = Optical Fiber Communication: From Transmission to Networking | publisher = IEEE | language = English | accessdate = 2006-10-18 }}</ref>

==="Heat"===
{{main|Thermal radiation}}
Infrared radiation is popularly known as "[[heat]]" or sometimes "heat radiation," since many people attribute all radiant heating to infrared light, but this is a widespread misconception. Light and electromagnetic waves of any frequency will heat surfaces which absorb them. Infrared light from the sun only accounts for 50% of the heating of the Earth, the rest being caused by visible light.{{Fact}} Green (or even [[ultraviolet]]) [[laser]]s can char paper and incandescently-hot objects will put out visible radiation. However, it is true that objects at room [[temperature]] will [[spontaneous emission|emit]] [[Thermal radiation|radiation]] mostly concentrated in the 8-12 micron band (see [[black body]] and [[Wien's displacement law]]).<ref>{{cite web | last = McCreary | first = Jeremy | date = October 30, 2004 | url = http://dpfwiw.com/ir.htm | title = Infrared (IR) basics for digital photographers—capturing the unseen (Sidebar: Black Body Radiation) | publisher = Digital Photography For What It's Worth | accessdate = 2006-11-07 }}</ref> Unlike heat transmitted by [[thermal conduction]] or [[thermal convection]], radiation can propagate through a vacuum.
Heat is the energy in transient form and flows due to temperature difference.

== Applications ==
{{unreferenced|date=July 2006}}
===Night vision===
Infrared is used in [[night-vision]] equipment when there is insufficient [[visible light]] to see an object. The radiation is detected and turned into an image on a screen, hotter objects showing up in different shades than cooler objects, enabling the [[police]] and military to acquire warm targets, such as [[human being]]s and [[automobile]]s. ''Also see [[Forward looking infrared]]''.  IR radiation is a secondary effect of heat; it is not heat itself.  Heat itself is a measure of the translational energy of an amount of matter.  "Thermal" detectors do not actually detect heat directly but the difference in IR radiation from objects. The device itself that detects the radiation is known as a [[photocathode]]. Military gunnery ranges sometimes use special materials that reflect IR radiation to simulate enemy vehicles with running engines.  The targets can be at the exact same temperature as the surrounding terrain, but they emit (reflect) much more IR radiation.  Different materials emit more or less IR radiation as temperature increases or decreases, depending on the composition of the material.   Infrared imagery is usually formed as a result of the integrated inband intensity of the radiation, based on temperate and emissivity. 

Simple infrared sensors were used by British, American and German forces in the [[Second World War]] as night vision aids for [[sniper]]s.

[[Smoke]] is more transparent to infrared than to visible light, so [[firefighter]]s use infrared imaging equipment when working in smoke-filled areas.

===Thermography===
[[Image:Infrared_dog.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A thermographic image of a dog]]
Infrared [[thermography]] is a non-contact, non-destructive test method that utilizes a thermal imager to detect, display and record thermal patterns and temperatures across the surface of an object. Infrared thermography may be applied to any situation where knowledge of thermal profiles and temperatures will provide meaningful data about a system, object or process. Thermography is widely used in industry for predictive maintenance, condition assessment, quality assurance, and forensic investigations of electrical, mechanical and structural systems. Other applications include, but are not limited to: law enforcement, firefighting, search and rescue, and medical and veterinary sciences.

Aside from test equipment, training is the most important investment a company will make in an infrared inspection program. Advances in technology have provided infrared equipment that is user-friendly; however, infrared thermography is not a “simply point and shoot” technology. In addition to understanding the object or system being inspected, thermographers must also understand common error sources that can influence observed thermal data. Typically,infrared training courses should cover the topics of infrared theory, heat transfer concepts, equipment selection and operation, how to eliminate or overcome common error sources, and specific applications. Training courses should be obtained from an independent training companies such as Infraspection Institute are preferred since they are not biased toward a single brand or type of equipment.

===Other imaging===
[[Image:Blue infrared light.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Infrared light from the [[LED]] of a [[remote control]] as seen by a digital camera.]] In [[infrared photography]], [[infrared filter]]s are used to capture the near-infrared spectrum. [[Digital camera]]s often use infrared [[blocker]]s. Cheaper [[digital camera]]s and some [[camera phones]] which do not have appropriate filters can "see" near-infrared, appearing as a bright white colour (try pointing a TV remote at your digital camera). This is especially pronounced when taking pictures of subjects near IR-bright areas (such as near a lamp), where the resulting infrared interference can wash out the image. There is also a technique called '[[Terahertz radiation|T-ray]]' imaging, which is imaging using far infrared or [[terahertz]] radiation. Lack of bright sources makes terahertz photography technically more challenging than most other infrared imaging techniques. Recently T-ray imaging has been of considerable interest due to a number of new developments such as [[terahertz time-domain spectroscopy]].

===Heating===
Infrared radiation is used in [[infrared sauna]]s to heat the occupants, and to remove ice from the wings of [[aircraft]] (de-icing). It is also gaining popularity as a method of heating asphalt pavements in place during new construction or in repair of damaged asphalt. Infrared can be used in cooking and heating food as it heats only opaque, absorbent objects and not the air around them, if there are no particles in it.

===Communications===
IR data transmission is also employed in short-range communication among computer peripherals and [[personal digital assistant]]s.  These devices usually conform to standards published by [[Infrared Data Association|IrDA]], the Infrared Data Association.  Remote controls and IrDA devices use infrared [[light-emitting diode]]s (LEDs) to emit infrared radiation which is focused by a plastic [[Lens (optics)|lens]] into a narrow beam.  The beam is [[modulation|modulated]], i.e. switched on and off, to encode the [[data]]. The receiver uses a [[silicon]] [[photodiode]] to convert the infrared radiation to an electric [[Current (electricity)|current]]. It responds only to the rapidly pulsing signal created by the transmitter, and filters out slowly changing infrared radiation from ambient light. Infrared communications are useful for indoor use in areas of high population density. IR does not penetrate walls and so does not interfere with other devices in adjoining rooms. Infrared is the most common way for [[remote control]]s to command appliances. 

[[Free space optics|Free space optical]] communication using infrared [[laser]]s can be a relatively inexpensive way to install a communications link in an urban area operating at up to 4 gigabit/s, compared to the cost of burying fiber optic cable.

Infrared lasers are used to provide the light for [[optical fiber]] communications systems. Infrared light with a wavelength around 1,330 nm (least [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]]) or 1,550 nm (best transmission) are the best choices for standard [[silica]] fibers.

===Spectroscopy===
[[Infrared spectroscopy|Infrared radiation spectroscopy]] (see also [[near infrared spectroscopy]]) is the study of the composition of (usually) [[organic compound]]s, finding out a compound's structure and composition based on the percentage transmittance of IR radiation through a sample. Different frequencies are absorbed by different stretches and bends in the [[molecular bond]]s occurring inside the sample. [[Carbon dioxide]], for example, has a strong absorption band at 4.2 µm.

===Meteorology===
[[Image:US IR satpic.JPG|thumb|left| IR Satellite picture taken 1315 Z on 15th October 2006. A [[weather front|frontal]] system can be seen in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] with embedded Cumulonimbus cloud. Shallower Cumulus and Stratocumulus can be seen off the [[Eastern Seaboard]].]]
[[Weather satellite]]s equipped with scanning radiometers produce thermal or infrared images which can then enable a trained analyst to determine cloud heights and types, to calculate land and surface water temperatures, and to locate ocean surface features. The scanning is typically in the range 10.3-12.5 µm (IR4 and IR5 channels). 

High, cold ice cloud such as [[Cirrus]] or [[Cumulonimbus]] show up bright white, lower warmer cloud such as [[Stratus]] or [[Stratocumulus]] show up as grey with intermediate clouds shaded accordingly. Hot land surfaces will show up as dark grey or black.  One disadvantage of infrared imagery is that low cloud such as stratus or [[fog]] can be a similar temperature to the surrounding land or sea surface does not show up. However using the difference in brightness of the IR4 channel (10.3-11.5 µm) and the near-infrared channel (1.58-1.64 µm), low cloud can be distinguished, producing a ''fog'' satellite picture. The main advantage of infrared is that images can be produced at night, allowing a continuous sequence of weather to be studied. 

These infrared pictures can depict ocean eddies or vortices and map currents such as the Gulf Stream which are valuable to the shipping industry. Fishermen and farmers are interested in knowing land and water temperatures to protect their crops against frost or increase their catch from the sea. Even [[El Niño]] phenomena can be spotted. Using color-digitized techniques, the gray shaded thermal images can be converted to color for easier identification of desired information.

===Astronomy===
[[Image:Spitzer- Telescopio.jpg|right|220px|thumb|The [[Spitzer Space Telescope]]is a dedicated infrared space observatory currently in orbit around the Earth. ''[[NASA]] image.'']]
{{main|infrared astronomy|far infrared astronomy}}
Astronomers observe objects in the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum using optical components, including mirrors, lenses and solid state digital detectors. For this reason it is classified as part of [[optical astronomy]]. To form an image, the components of an infrared telescope need to be carefully shielded from heat sources, and the detectors are chilled using liquid [[helium]].
 
The sensitivity of Earth-based infrared telescopes is significantly limited by water vapor in the atmosphere, which absorbs a portion of the infrared radiation arriving from space outside of selected [[atmospheric window]]s. This limitation can be partially alleviated by placing the telescope observatory at a high altitude, or by carrying the telescope aloft with a balloon or an aircraft. Space telescopes do not suffer from this handicap, and so outer space is considered the ideal location for infrared astronomy.

The infrared portion of the spectrum has several useful benefits for astronomers. Cold, dark [[molecular cloud]]s of gas and dust in our galaxy will glow with radiated heat as they are irradiated by imbedded stars. Infrared can also be used to detect [[protostar]]s before they begin to emit visible light. Stars emit a smaller portion of their energy in the infrared spectrum, so nearby cool objects such as [[planet]]s can be more readily detected. (In the visible light spectrum, the glare from the star will drown out the reflected light from a planet.)

Infrared light is also useful for observing the cores of [[active galaxy|active galaxies]] which are often cloaked in gas and dust. Distant galaxies with a high [[redshift]] will have the peak portion of their spectrum shifted toward longer wavelengths, so they are more readily observed in the infrared.<ref name="ir_astronomy" />

===Art history and Archaeology===
[[Image:Jan van Eyck 001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''[[The Arnolfini Portrait]]'' by [[Jan van Eyck]], [[National Gallery, London]]]]
Infra-red (as art historians call them) reflectograms are taken of paintings to reveal underlying layers, in particular the underdrawing or outline drawn to by the artist as a guide. This often uses [[carbon black]] which shows up well in reflectograms, so long as it has not also been used in the ground underlying the whole painting.  Art historians are looking to see if the visible layers of paint differ from the under-drawing or layers in between - such alterations are called [[pentimento|pentimenti]] when made by the original artist.  This is very useful information in deciding whether a painting is the prime version by the original artist or a copy, and whether it has been altered by over-enthusiatic restoration work.  Generally the more pentimenti, the more likely a painting is to be the prime version.  It also gives useful insights into working practices. [[http://www.clevelandart.org/exhibcef/ConsExhib/html/grien.html]]  

Among many other changes in the [[Arnolfini Portrait]] of 1434 (right), his face was higher by about the height of his eye, hers was higher, and her eyes looked more to the front.  Each of his feet was underdrawn in one position, painted in another, and then overpainted in a third.  These alterations are seen in infra-red reflectograms.<ref>National Gallery Catalogues: The Fifteenth Century Netherlandish Paintings by Lorne Campbell, 1998, ISBN 185709171</ref>

Similar uses of infrared are made by archaeologists on various types of objects, especially very old written documents such as the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], the Roman works in the [[Villa of the Papyri]], and the Silk Road texts found in the [[Mogao Caves|Dunhuang Caves]].<ref>[http://idp.bl.uk/pages/technical_resources.a4d International Dunhuang Project An Introduction to digital infrared photography and its application within IDP -paper pdf 6.4MB]</ref> Carbon black used in ink can show up extremely well.

===Biological systems===
[[Image:wiki_snake_eats_mouse.jpg|thumb|right|thermographic image of a snake eating a mouse]]
The [[Crotalinae|pit viper]] is known to have two infrared sensory pits on its head. There is controversy over the exact thermal sensitivity of this biological infrared detection system.<ref> {{cite journal

==The Earth as an infrared emitter==
{{unreferenced|date=July 2006}}
The [[Earth]]'s surface and the clouds [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorb]] visible and invisible radiation from the [[sun]] and re-emit much of the energy as infrared back to the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. Certain substances in the atmosphere, chiefly cloud droplets and [[water]] vapor, but also [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]], [[nitrous oxide]], [[sulfur hexafluoride]], and [[chlorofluorocarbons]], absorb this infrared, and re-radiate it in all directions including back to Earth. Thus the [[greenhouse effect]] keeps the atmosphere and surface much warmer than if the infrared absorbers were absent from the atmosphere.

==History of infrared science==
{{unreferenced|date=July 2006}}
{{cleanup-section|September 2006}}
The discovery of infrared radiation is ascribed to [[William Herschel]], the [[astronomer]], in the early [[19th century]]. Herschel published his results in 1800 before the UK Royal Society. Herschel used a [[Triangular prism (optics)|prism]] to [[refract]] light from the [[sun]] and detected the infrared, beyond the [[red]] part of the spectrum, through an increase in the temperature recorded on a [[thermometer]]. He was surprised at the result and called them "Calorific Rays".  The term 'Infrared' did not appear until late in the 19th century.  Incidentally, Herschel is buried in Westminster Abbey between Darwin and Newton.
