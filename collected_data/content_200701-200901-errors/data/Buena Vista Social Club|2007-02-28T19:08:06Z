The '''Buena Vista Social Club''' was a members-only music club in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]] that was at its height during the [[1940s]].  In the late [[1990s]] [[Wim Wenders]] made a movie upon the initiative of [[Ry Cooder]] called ''[[Buena Vista Social Club (movie)|Buena Vista Social Club]]'' about some of the musicians who had performed there and their involvement in the production of an album released in [[1997]] also called ''[[Buena Vista Social Club (album)|Buena Vista Social Club]]''.  Both movie and album were highly successful, and started a craze for Cuban music in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]].  A number of subsequent albums featuring the same musicians have been released, with the title "Buena Vista Social Club" being used as something like a brand to link them.
