A '''trade route''' is the sequence of pathways and stopping places used for the commercial transport of [[cargo]]. Trade routes can be [[landform|land]] or [[marine (ocean)|water]]-based. 

Which route was considered preferable (or not) for use by groups of merchants and their armed and [[logistical]] escort, depended on a number of background factors, including an overall political and economic situation in areas to be crossed, travellers' mode of [[transport]], their navigation skills and knowledge of geography (and weather patterns), as well as on the actual ease, speed, safety and profitability of such journeys. 

The English archaeologist [[Colin Renfrew]] and his colleagues first demonstrated that finds of [[obsidian]], a black volcanic glass useful for sharp cutting edges before the [[Bronze Age]], provided a uniquely sensitive indicator of Neolithic trade routes, because the trace-elements in obsidian are usually diagnostic of individual sources [http://www.arch.ox.ac.uk/ArchAtlas/Obsidian%20Routes/Obsidian%20routes.htm].

The first documented long-distance [[transport|networks]] of [[caravan]] routes and [[shipping]] routes have been established approximately 4,000 BCE between the early-urban settlements in lowland [[Mesopotamia]] (southern [[Iraq]]). The shipping routes through the Persian Gulf found their major depot in the island of [[Dilmun]]. By the time of the early Roman Empire, sea-routes through the Mediterranean and the Red Sea can be traced in detail through several examples of the point-by-point coastal description called a [[periplus]]. 

==Important trade routes==
* ''Silk and [[Spice Route|Spice]] Routes'' connected various empires across [[Europe]] and [[Asia]], including the [[Roman Empire]] and the [[Han Dynasty]], around the [[1st century]]. These routes connected a number of [[trading post]]s and spanned a large part of the known world. The trade ties via land routes called the "silk road" and via sea routes known as the "spice route".
** The ''[[Silk Road]]'' is the main route from the [[Iranian Plateau]] to Western [[China]], leading from [[oasis]] to oasis, and skirting the [[desert]]s of [[Central Asia]], which was in use long before it was officially sanctioned. See also [[Ancient tea route]].
** The Persian ''[[Royal Road]]'' was established by [[Persian Empire|Persian]] kings, who set up way stations or [[caravanserai]] along the ancient Silk Road route across the Iranian Plateau. 
** The ''[[Spice Route]]'' went from [[Arabia]], [[Persia]] and India to [[Guangzhou]] in China, bypassed the [[Straits of Malacca]].
** The [[Early transpeninsular routeway]], part of the early [[Spice Route]] occurred on the [[Malay Peninsula]]. 
** [[Incense Route]] connected the [[Arabian Peninsula]] to [[North Africa]], [[Levant]] and Europe and were largely run by Arabian traders who supplied those regions with [[frankincense]] and [[myrrh]] from [[Oman]] and the [[Hadhramaut]].
** The ancient [[King's Highway (ancient)|King's Highway]] and the [[Via Maris]] which connected Egypt and [[Mesopotamia]] via the [[Levant]].
* The ''[[Amber Road]]'' connected the [[North Sea]] and [[Baltic Sea]] coasts by way of the [[Vistula]] and [[Dnieper river|Dnieper]] rivers to [[Italy]], [[Greece]], [[Black Sea]] and [[Egypt]]. The Silk Road could then be reached from the Black Sea for further transporting Baltic [[amber]].
* ''[[The Trade Route from the Varangians to the Greeks]]'' utilised [[portage]]s in [[Russia]] to cross [[Europe]] and provided an alternative navigation route from the North Sea and the Baltic to the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Mediterranean]], also reaching the [[Caspian Sea]].
* ''[[Trans-Saharan trade]] routes'' connected [[West Africa]] and [[Mediterranean]] countries.
* The ''trans-[[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] trade route'' of the annual ''[[Manila Galleon]]s'', linking [[Acapulco]] with [[Manila]], from the 16th to the 19th centuries.
