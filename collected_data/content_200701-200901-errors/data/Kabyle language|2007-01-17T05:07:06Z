'''Kabyle''' is a [[Berber language]] (Kabyle: ''{{unicode|Ṯaq<u>b</u>ayliṯ}}'', {{Audio|Taqbaylit.ogg|'''Taqbaylit'''}}, [[International Phonetic Alphabet|pronounced]] {{IPA|/ˌθaq.βajˈliθ/}}) spoken by the [[Kabyle people]]. In [[1995]], there were 3,123,000 speakers worldwide, the majority in [[Algeria]], where there were more than 2,000,000. However, according to [[INALCO]] estimates, there are 5.5 million speakers in Algeria and about 7 million worldwide.

Kabyle was (with some exceptions) rarely written before the [[20th century]]; however, in recent years a small but increasing body of literature has been printed. The originally [[Oral literature|oral poetry]] of [[Si Mohand]] is particularly notable in this respect. Famous Kabyle singers include [[Lounès Matoub|Matoub Lounes]], [[Idir]] and [[Ait Menguellet]].

== Grammar ==

===Nouns and adjectives===
====Gender====
As an [[Afro-asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic language]], Kabyle has only two [[Grammatical gender|genders]], Masculine and Feminine. Like most [[Berber languages]], masculine nouns and adjectives generally start with a vowel (''a-'', ''i-'', ''u-''), while the feminine nouns generally start with ''t-'' and end with a ''-t'' (there are some exceptions, however). Note that most feminine nouns are in fact feminized versions of masculine nouns.

Examples: 
*''Aqcic'' "a boy", '''''t'''aqcic'''t''''' "a girl".
*''Amγar'' "an old man", '''''t'''amγar'''t''''' "an old woman".
*''Argaz'' "a man", Tame{{unicode|ṭṭ}}ut "a woman".
*''Izi'' "a fly", ''Tizit'' "mosquito".

====Pluralization====
Singular nouns generally start with an ''a-'', and do no have a suffix. Plural nouns generally start with an ''i-'' and often have a suffix such as ''-en''. There are three types of plural : external, internal, mix:

*External: '''''a'''mγar'' "an old man"; '''''i'''mγar'''en''''' "old men". Notice that the ''a-'' has turned into an ''i-'', and the suffix "-en" has been added.

*Internal: '''''a'''mic'''i'''c'' "a cat"; '''''i'''mc'''a'''c'' "cats". Notice that the ''a'' and ''i'' have traded positions, but there is no suffix added.

*Mix: ''igen'''ni''''' "sky"; ''igen'''wan''''' "skies". Notice that the "i-" has been kept, and the previous suffix, ''-ni'' has been replaced.

====Free and annexed state====
Depending on the role of the noun in the sentence, it takes either its free or annexed state:

*Free: ''Yewwet '''a'''qcic''. "He has beaten a boy".
*Annexed: ''Yewwet '''we'''qcic''. "The boy has beaten".

After a preposition (at the exception of "ar" and "s"), all nouns take their annexed state:

*Free state: '''A'''man (water), Kas n '''wa'''man (a glass of water).

===Verbs===
There are three tenses : the [[Preterite]] (past), intensive Aorist (present perfect, present continuous, past continuous) and the future (Ad+Aoriste). Unlike other berber languages, the [[aorist]] alone is rarely used in Kabyle (In the other languages it is used to express the present). 

"Weak verbs" have their preterite the same as their aoriste, the examples of weak verbs that follows are conjugated at the first person of the singular:
