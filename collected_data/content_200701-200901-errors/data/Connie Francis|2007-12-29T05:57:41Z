'''Connie Francis''' (born [[December 12]], [[1938]] in [[Newark, New Jersey]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[pop singer]] best known for international hit songs such as "[[Who's Sorry Now?]]", "[[Where The Boys Are]]", and "[[Everybody's Somebody's Fool]]". She is known to have one of the most distinctive voices in the history of pop music.{{Fact|date=November 2007}}

==Biography==
===Early years===
Connie Francis was born '''Concetta Rosa Maria Franconero''' in the Italian Down Neck, or [[Ironbound]], neighborhood of [[Newark, New Jersey]].  She is considered the most prolific and popular female [[rock 'n' roll]] hit-maker of the early rock era — the late 1950s to the early 1960s.{{Fact|date=November 2007}}  After an appearance on ''[[Startime|Ford Startime]]'', Francis was advised to change her name from Franconero to something more easily pronounceable — as well as to quit the [[accordion]] and focus on singing.

Francis' first single, "Freddy", ([[1955 in music|1955]]) met with little success. Her next nine singles were also failures. During this time Connie was introduced to then up and coming singer/songwriter [[Bobby Darin]]. Bobby's manager arranged for Darin to help write several songs for Connie in order to help jump-start her singing career. Initially the two artists couldn't see eye to eye on potential material but after several weeks Bobby and Connie developed a romantic interest in one another. Unfortunately Connie had a very strict Italian father who would separate the couple whenever possible. When Connie's father learned that Bobby had suggested the two lovers elope after one of Connie's shows, he ran Darin out of the building while waving a gun telling Bobby to never see his daughter again. Bobby saw Connie only two more times after this happened, once when the two were scheduled to sing together for a television show and again later when Connie was spotlighted on the tv series ''[[This Is Your Life]]''. To date Connie has said that not marrying Bobby was the biggest mistake of her life.<ref>Autobiography ''Who's Sorry Now'' by Connie Francis</ref>

=== Initial success ===
After considering a career in medicine due to the failure of her first few demos, a [[cover version]] of the song "[[Who's Sorry Now?]]" ([[1923 in music|1923]]) by [[Bert Kalmar]] and [[Harry Ruby]] launched Francis into super-stardom worldwide.  She recorded the song at what was to have been her final recording session for [[MGM]]; the label was about to drop her owing to her previous singles' poor sales.  Francis has said that she recorded it at the suggestion of her father, who convinced her it stood a chance of becoming a hit because it was a song adults already knew and that teenagers would dance to if it were released with a more contemporary arrangement.  

The gamble paid off. On [[January 1]], [[1958]], the song debuted on [[Dick Clark]]'s ''[[American Bandstand]]'' television show, and by mid-year over a million copies were sold.  In April [[1958 in music|1958]], "Who's Sorry Now" reached number one on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and number four in the USA.{{Fact|date=November 2007}}  This was followed by many other hits over the next decade, as Connie Francis became one of the most popular vocalists in the world.{{Fact|date=November 2007}}

As Francis explains at each of her concerts, she began searching for a new hit immediately after her 1958 single ''[[Who's Sorry Now?]]'' became a success. She was then introduced to [[Neil Sedaka]] and [[Howard Greenfield]], who played every ballad they had written to date, for Connie.  After a few hours, Francis began writing in her [[diary]] while the two songwriters played the last of their ballads. After they finished their last song of the session, Francis told them that they wrote very beautiful ballads but that she considered them too intellectual for the young generation of the time.  Greenfield then suggested to Sedaka a song they had written that morning for another girl group.  Sedaka protested, believing that Francis would be insulted. Greenfield said that she hated all the other songs they had performed and that they had nothing more to lose. Sedaka reluctantly agreed to play ''Stupid Cupid'' with Greenfield for Francis. As soon as they finished playing the song, Francis told them that they had just played her new hit record. Francis' song reached #14 on the Billboard charts. While Francis was writing in her diary, Sedaka asked her if he could read what she had written. After she refused, Sedaka was inspired to write ''The Diary'', which was his first hit single. Through the rest of her early career Sedaka and Greenfield wrote many of Connie Francis' hits such as ''Fallin'' and ''[[Where the Boys Are]]''.

===Singing career===
Connie specialized in downbeat ballads (often remakes of old standards) delivered in her trademark "sobbing" style, such as "[[My Happiness (country song)|My Happiness]]", "I'm Sorry I Made You Cry", "[[Among My Souvenirs]]", "Together", "Breakin' In a Brand New Broken Heart", and the [[Italian language|Italian]] song "Mama".  However, she also had success with a handful of more upbeat, rock-and-roll-oriented compositions, such as "Stupid Cupid", "Lipstick On Your Collar", and "Vacation". 

Among Francis' other notable performances were "In the Summer of His Years" (a tribute to slain U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]]) and [[Bert Kaempfert]]'s "[[Strangers in the Night]]" (although the latter song is more often identified with [[Frank Sinatra]]).{{Fact|date=November 2007}} Both "[[Everybody's Somebody's Fool]]" and "[[My Heart Has a Mind of Its Own]]" went to number one on the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' music charts in [[1960 in music|1960]]. In [[1962 in music|1962]], Francis had another number one hit with "[[Don't Break the Heart That Loves You]]". 

Francis remade many of her hits in foreign languages, including "Everybody's Somebody's Fool" and her [[signature song]], "[[Where the Boys Are]]".  Francis recorded in thirteen languages throughout her career: English, German, Swedish, Dutch, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian (and its dialect Neapolitan), Hebrew, Yiddish, Japanese, Latin and Hawaiian. During a concert at the [[Golden Stag Festival]] in [[Braşov]], [[Romania]] in March 1970, Francis performed live in Romanian.  Francis' biggest hit album in the U.S. was 1959's ''[[Italian Favorites]]''; she followed it with several more albums of Italian songs over the years, as well as collections of Spanish-language and Jewish songs, among others.

===Broadened horizons===
In the [[1960 in film|1960]] [[motion picture]] ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' Connie was able to highlight her acting talents to a broader range of audiences. During the first half of the 1960s, she starred in three additional films: ''[[Follow the Boys (1963 film)|Follow the Boys]]'' (1963) (the title song of which became a No. 17 Billboard single for Francis), ''Looking for Love'' (1964), and ''When the Boys Meet the Girls'' (1965).

In 1960, Francis became the youngest headliner to sing in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]],{{Fact|date=November 2007}}  where she played 28 days a year for nine years. In 1961, she starred in her own television special on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television sponsored by [[Brylcreem]] titled ''Kicking Sound Around'', singing and acting alongside [[Tab Hunter]], [[Eddie Foy Jr.]] and [[Art Carney]]. Francis appeared on the ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show|Ed Sullivan Show]]'' on [[July 1]], [[1962]] with French singing star [[Johnny Hallyday]] in a show that was taped at the famous [[Moulin Rouge]] nightclub in [[Paris, France]]. On [[July 3]], [[1963]], she played a [[Royal Variety Performance|Command performance]] before [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] at the [[Alhambra Theatre]] in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]]. By 1967, Francis had 35 U.S. Top 40 hits, three of which were number ones.  During the height of the [[Vietnam War]] in 1967, Connie Francis performed for U.S. troops.  Francis ended her recording career in 1969. She returned in 1973 with "The Answer", a song written just for her, and soon began performing again.

Francis has always been a great fan of [[country music]],{{Fact|date=November 2007}}  and recorded several albums of country standards during her pop career.  In 1969, she had a modest country hit with, "The Wedding Cake."  She appeared on the country charts again in 1982 with "There's Still a Few Good Love Songs Left in Me."  Several country singers found chart success remaking Francis' pop hits for the country market, including [[Marie Osmond]] ("Who's Sorry Now" in 1975), [[Susan Raye]] ("My Heart Has a Mind of Its Own" in 1972), [[Margo Smith]] ("Don't Break The Heart That Loves You" in 1978), and [[Debby Boone]]. 

===Later years===
Connie released her [[autobiography]], ''Who's Sorry Now?'' in 1984. It was her second attempt at writing as she had previously released the book ''For Every Young Heart'' in 1962.

In 2000, "Who's Sorry Now" was named one of the [[Songs of the Century]].  Her latest CD ''The American Tour'' contains performances from recent shows. In late December 2004, Francis headlined in Las Vegas for the first time since 1989.

In March and October 2007, Francis performed to sold-out crowds at the [[Castro Theater]] in [[San Francisco]].{{Fact|date=November 2007}}

In December 2007, Connie Francis was inducted into the Hit Parade Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Francis has been married four times. She married Dick Kanellis against her father's wishes on [[August 15]], [[1964]]. She [[divorce]]d him three months later after he [[domestic violence|abused]] her.<ref>Biography Channel's profile on Connie Francis "Connie Francis - Sweetheart of Song"</ref>  She then married hairdresser Izadore "Izzy" Marion on [[January 16]], [[1971]]. They divorced the following year. She then married Joseph Garzilli in September 1973. Together they adopted a son, Joseph Garzilli Jr, "Joey," born in 1974. After the marriage ended, she later married television producer Bob Parkinson, on June 27, 1985. She later divorced him also. She had a brief affair with a man named Maxwell J. Odenthal in June of 1986.{{Fact|date=November 2007}} 

Early in her career, Francis dated singer [[Bobby Darin]], much to the displeasure of Connie's father. When Darin suggested the two [[elope]], Francis' father chased after him with a gun telling him to never see his daughter again.<ref>Autobiography "Who's Sorry Now" by Connie Francis</ref> The two broke up shortly thereafter. Francis still says that not marrying Darin was the biggest mistake of her life.<ref>Autobiography "Who's Sorry Now" by Connie Francis</ref>

On [[November 8]], [[1974]] Francis was [[rape]]d in the [[Jericho Turnpike]] [[Howard Johnson's]] Lodge following a performance at the [[Westbury Music Fair]] in [[New York]].  After returning to the room some time after the attack she discovered the broken lock and torn screen had not been repaired by facility management. She subsequently [[lawsuit|sued]] the motel chain for failing to provide adequate security. She reportedly won a $3 million judgment, at the time one of the largest such judgments in history.  She did not perform again for seven years thereafter.<ref>http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0203/11/lkl.00.html</ref> She has stated that it was because of the rape that she divorced Joseph Garzilli. 

Nasal surgery to correct previous surgery caused a sensitivity to [[air conditioning]] and deprived her of her ability to sing professionally for four years.

In 1978, she attempted a [[comeback]] by appearing with her friend [[Dick Clark]] on his [[ABC-TV]] variety show ''[[Dick Clark's Live Wednesday]]''. Unknown to the audience, the still-fragile Francis lip-synched to a pre-recorded disco medley of her hit ''Where the Boys Are''.

Her brother was murdered in 1981.

Francis was later diagnosed with [[bipolar disorder]]. She has long suffered from continuing mental impairments that developed as a result of her rape,<ref>Biography Channel's profile on Connie Francis "Connie Francis - Sweetheart of Song"</ref> including drug dependencies and [[suicide]] attempts. She uses [[Lithium pharmacology|lithium]] to treat the illness.<ref>Biography Channel's profile on Connie Francis "Connie Francis - Sweetheart of Song"</ref>

She resumed her career in 1989.

==Lawsuits==
Francis brought suit alleging that UMG took advantage of her condition and stopped paying royalties. It was dismissed. On [[November 27]], [[2002]], she filed a second suit against UMG alleging the label had "synchronized" two of her songs into movies without her permission. This suit was also dismissed.

She also sued the producers of the 1999 film ''[[Jawbreaker (film)|Jawbreaker]]'', in which her song "Lollipop Lips" is heard during a sex scene.<ref>http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1589/is_2002_April_16/ai_84669421/</ref>

==Biopic==
Connie and singer [[Gloria Estefan]] completed a screenplay for a movie based on Francis' life, titled ''Who's Sorry Now?''.<ref>http://in.news.yahoo.com/040204/139/2bavl.html</ref>  Estefan will produce and play the lead.  Estefan said, "She [Francis] isn't in the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], and yet she was the first pop star worldwide, and has recorded in nine languages. She has done a lot of things for victims' rights since her rape in the '70s . . . There's a major story there."<ref>http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/archives/2003/oct/09/515719545.html?gloria+estefan</ref>  The "long gestating biopic" will begin pre-production within a few months, according to a story published in [[March 2007]] in the ''[[Bay Area Reporter]]''.

==Trivia==
*''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' chart historian [[Joel Whitburn]] ranks Connie Francis as the top female vocalist on the [[Adult Contemporary]] chart during the 1960s.

==Selected other significant songs==

* "Freddy" (1955)
The A-Side of Francis' first ever published single (1955, MGM Records K 12015). Although the single's B-Side "Didn't I love you enough" would've been the better choice from the artistic point of view, "Freddy" was given the A-Side status because MGM's president, Harry Meyerson, had a son named Freddy and Meyerson thought of this song as a suitable birthday gift. A version recorded by [[Eartha Kitt]] and [[Perez Prado]] was released at the same time as the Francis version. Although it also failed to chart, it still sold better than the Francis version because of its exciting [[mambo]] arrangement, which was part of the current sound of the day.

* "My First Real Love" (1956)
[[Bobby Darin]] wrote this song for Francis, which led to their first encounter. Darin was "The Jaybirds", who were credited as background vocals. The choir effect was reached by Darin recording his part several times in different keys. Despite the teaming up of those two great talents, the single failed to chart.

* "[[Never On Sunday (song)|Never On Sunday]]" (1961)
Francis was invited to the 1961 Academy Awards Ceremony to present one of the songs nominated for an Academy Award. She was offered "The second time around" from the movie "[[High Time]]" starring [[Bing Crosby]]. She turned that song down in favour of "Never on Sunday", even singing a few bars of the original Greek lyrics during the ceremony. Francis never considered releasing a recording of the song as a single, because [[The Chordettes]] had already taken their version to # 1 of the charts. But in August 1961, Francis recorded the song for an album with motion picture songs.

* "[[Al di là]]" (1962)
Contrary to popular belief, this song did ''not'' originate in the 1962 movie "Rome Adventure" where it was presented by Emilio Pericoli. The song was actually written as an entry for the [[San Remo Festival]]. Originally recorded and performed by Betty Curtis, it became the winning song of the 1961 edition of the festival, which subsequently resulted in the nominations as Italy's entry for the 1961 edition of the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] (# 5). Connie Francis included the song on her album "Connie Francis sings Modern Italian hits" (MGM Records SE-4102), which was recorded in November 1962. Several versions of the Francis version exist: 1.) Bilingual Italian/English, running time 3'17", released in the US on both the album and MGM single K 13116, 2.) Pure Italian, running time 3'30", released in Mexico on MGM Records [[EP]] EXPL 1034, 3.) Pure Italian, alternate take, running time 3'46", released in Spain on MGM Records EP 63-025. To this day, [[Al di là]] remains as a popular part of Francis' live act.

* "Mala Femmena" (1963)
Francis created a phenomenon by recording this song, because the lyrics were actually written for a male singer. The original lyrics tell about a man who finds out that his woman is cheating on him. Francis had the song rewritten, which told now the story of a woman telling "the other woman" to leave her man alone. This recording peaked only at # 114 in the US, but became her fourth # 1 hit in Italy

* "Tommy" (1964)
Between late 1962 and late 1964, Francis recorded and released several songs which dabbled with the [[Girl group]] sound, which was created by successful acts such as The [[Shangri-Las]], The [[Ronettes]] or [[Lesley Gore]]. Popular writers and producers of that sound were [[Phil Spector]], [[Jeff Barry]], and [[Ellie Greenwich]]. The latter two wrote and co-produced several songs for Francis. One of them was "Tommy". Recorded during an extensive session on April 8, 1964, this song, which would eventually be released as the flip side of "Blue Winter" on MGM Records Single K 13237, featured [[Ellie Greenwich]] and [[The Tokens]] as special guest backup vocals.

* "Somewhere, My Love (Lara's Theme)" (1966)
The lyrics for a vocal version of the best known theme from the [[Doctor Zhivago]] sound track were written by Academy Award winning lyricist [[Paul Francis Webster]] after a special request from Francis herself. But Francis rejected the lyrics at first because she thought of them as too corny. When she finally realized the song's potential, The [[Ray Conniff]] Singers had recorded it and taken to # 1 of the charts. Francis' version became a hit nonetheless, becoming a # 1 in several Asian countries and Scandinavia. The Italian recording, "Dove non so", became her last # 1 hit in Italy.
