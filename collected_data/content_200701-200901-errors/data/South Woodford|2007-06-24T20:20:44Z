'''South Woodford''' is a suburb of north-east [[London]] in the [[London Borough of Redbridge]], situated 8.9 miles (14.3 km) north-east of [[Charing Cross]]. Together with [[Woodford Green]] and [[Woodford Bridge]] it forms the area known as [[Woodford]], the origins of which date back to at least [[anglo-saxons|Saxon]] times. It was part of [[Essex]] until [[1965]].

==Description==

South Woodford's central retail and business areas are distributed largely around George Lane &mdash; the main [[high street]] for the district &mdash; and Woodford Green High Road. There is a [[Sainsbury's]], a [[Waitrose]], a [[Woolworths Group plc|Woolworths]] store, a [[Laura Ashley]] Home Furnishings, a [[Marks and Spencer]] Simply Food, and a good selection of smaller shops and restaurants. 
There is an [[Odeon Cinemas|Odeon cinema]] on the High Road. 
The legendary [[rock and roll]] [[drums|drummer]] [[Terry Chimes]] of [[Black Sabbath]] and [[The Clash|Clash]] fame now has a [[chiropracty|chiropractic]] practice in the area.

George Lane itself is split into two by the [[Central Line]] rail track with the northern part of the road containing the vast majority of the shops and businesses. There was originally a [[level crossing]] at this point, but now a flyover system carries traffic from the east side of George Lane to the west side. 
This area was also, until 2004, home to the student residences of [[Queen Mary, University of London]], but the distinctive tower blocks have been recently demolished in favour of the area's ever-increasing housing developments.

South Woodford sits at the junction of the [[A406 road|North Circular Road]] with the start of the [[M11 motorway]]. A large roundabout called "Charlie Brown's" dominates the northern part of South Woodford.  The roundabout is named after a pub/transport caf√© which was demolished when the roundabout was enlarged to accommodate flyover sliproads onto the newly-constructed motorway.

The area is served by [[South Woodford tube station]] on the [[Central Line]] of the [[London Underground]].
