The '''New Jersey Devils''' are a professional [[ice hockey]] team based in [[Newark, New Jersey]]. They are members of the [[Atlantic Division (NHL)|Atlantic Division]] of the [[Eastern Conference (NHL)|Eastern Conference]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL). The club was founded in [[Kansas City, Missouri]] in 1974, moved to [[Denver, Colorado]] after only two seasons, and then settled in New Jersey in 1982. Under current [[general manager]] [[Lou Lamoriello]], the Devils have made the [[Season structure of the NHL#Stanley Cup playoffs|playoffs]] in 18 out of the last 20 seasons, including each of the last 11. They have won the [[Stanley Cup]] in [[1995 Stanley Cup Finals|1995]], [[2000 Stanley Cup Finals|2000]], and [[2003 Stanley Cup Finals|2003]]. <ref name="Playoffs">{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsline.com/nhl/teams/history/NJ| title = New Jersey Devils History| accessdate = 2006-11-19| publisher = CBS Sportsline}}</ref>

Since their move to New Jersey, the Devils have played their home games at the [[Izod Center]] (originally named the Brendan Byrne Arena, which was then changed to Continental Airlines Arena in 1996). Starting in the 2007-08 season, the team began playing their home games at the brand new [[Prudential Center]], in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]].<ref name="groundbreak">{{cite web|url=http://www.newjerseydevils.com/2005/html/theteam/teamnews/nwk-groundbreaking.php|title=Newark Breaks Ground for Devils Arena|accessdate=2006-08-30|year=2005|publisher=New Jersey Devils}}</ref> The first game at the new arena took place on [[October 27]], [[2007]] against the [[Ottawa Senators]], whom the Devils played against in the last home game at Continental Airlines Arena.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/starledger/stories/index.ssf?/base/sports-0/118412796777830.xml&coll=1|title=Devils add to defense, but it's not Souray|accessdate=2007-07-11|year=2007|publisher=[[The Star-Ledger]]}}</ref>

==Franchise history==
===Kansas City and Colorado===
{{see also|Kansas City Scouts|Colorado Rockies (NHL)}}
In 1974, the NHL ended its first [[Expansion team|expansion]] period by adding teams in [[Kansas City, Missouri]] and [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rauzulusstreet.com/hockey/nhlhistory/nhlhistory.html|title=National Hockey League (NHL) Expansion History|accessdate=2006-08-30|publisher=Rauzulu's Street}}</ref> The Kansas City franchise was to be called the Mohawks, since the Kansas City metropolitan area includes portions of Missouri and [[Kansas]]. However, the [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]] objected to the similarity. The team was renamed the [[Kansas City Scouts|Scouts]] after a statue in the city.<ref name="kcscouts">{{cite web|url= http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nhl/kansascity/kcscouts.html|title=History of the Kansas City Scouts|work=Sports E-Cyclopedia|publisher=Tank Productions|accessdate=2006-03-25}}</ref>
[[Image:KansasCityScouts.png|thumb|110px|left|Logo of the Kansas City Scouts (1974&ndash;1976)]] On [[October 9]], [[1974]], the Scouts took the ice for the first time at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] in [[Toronto]] and lost 6-2 to the [[Toronto Maple Leafs|Maple Leafs]]. Due to a [[rodeo]] being held in Kansas City's brand-new [[Kemper Arena]], the Scouts were forced to wait nine games before making their home debut. Although they lost that game to the Black Hawks 4–3, the next night they beat their expansion brethren, the [[Washington Capitals]], 5-4. Like most expansion teams, the Scouts were terrible, garnering only 41 points in their inaugural season. The next season, they won only 12 games&mdash;still the worst in franchise history. The Scouts failed to make the playoffs in either season in Kansas City and won only 27 of 160 games.

Although they were better than the Capitals (who won only eight games in their inaugural season), the Scouts began to suffer from an economic downturn in the Midwest. For their second season, the Scouts sold just 2,000 of 8,000 [[season ticket]]s and was almost $1 million in debt. They finished the [[1974-75 NHL season|1974-75 season]] with only 41 points.  Due to these on-and off-ice disappointments, the franchise moved to [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] and was renamed the [[Colorado Rockies (NHL)|Colorado Rockies]].<ref name="kcscouts" />

[[Image:ColoradoRockiesHockey.png|thumb|120px|right|Logo of the Colorado Rockies (1976&ndash;1982)]]
The team made a fresh start in Colorado, winning its first game 4-2 over Toronto. They picked up momentum and looked like a possible playoff contender, but things collapsed in February, and the Rockies finished the [[1976-77 NHL season|1976–77 season]] with a record of 20-46-14; good for 54 points. The next season, despite finishing with fewer wins (they finished 21 games under .500), they managed to edge the [[Vancouver Canucks]] out of the last playoff spot by two points, but were quickly eliminated by the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] in the first round of the 1978 Stanley Cup playoffs.

A lack of stability continually dogged the team. In their first eight years, the Scouts/Rockies went through ten coaches, including eight in their first seven years, and none lasting more than one full season.  While in Denver, the team changed owners twice.

Prior to the [[1978-79 NHL season|1978–79 season]], owner Jack Vickers sold the team to Arthur Imperatore, who announced that he wished to move the team to the [[Meadowlands Sports Complex|New Jersey Meadowlands]]. The NHL vetoed the move since the [[Izod Center|Brendan Byrne Arena]] was still being built, and there was no suitable temporary facility in the area. In 1979, the team hired [[Don Cherry (ice hockey)|Don Cherry]] as head coach and traded for Maple Leafs star [[Lanny McDonald]]. Despite these moves, the Rockies still posted the worst record in the NHL. They played the next two seasons with the possibility of moving until [[May 27]], [[1982]], when New Jersey shipping tycoon [[John McMullen (engineer)|John McMullen]] purchased the team and announced that the long-expected move to New Jersey would finally come to pass.<ref name="rockies">{{cite web|url= http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nhl/colnj/nhlrockies.html|title=History of the Colorado Rockies|work=Sports E-Cyclopedia|publisher=Tank Productions|accessdate=2006-03-25}}</ref>

The team would now be playing right in the middle of the [[New York]]&ndash;New Jersey&ndash;[[Connecticut]] [[tri-state area]], home to the three-time defending [[Stanley Cup]] champion [[New York Islanders]], as well as the very popular [[New York Rangers]]. The Devils had to compensate the Islanders, Rangers and [[Philadelphia Flyers]] for "invading" New Jersey.<ref name="HockeyChron">{{cite book |last=Duhatschek |first=Eric et al. |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Hockey Chronicles |year=2001 |publisher=Checkmark Books |location=New York City |isbn=0816046972}}</ref>

===New Jersey===
====1982&ndash;1993====
[[Image:Nj devil notgreyscale.png|right|thumb|150px|The [[Jersey Devil]], inspiration for the team's name.]]
The team was renamed the New Jersey Devils on [[June 30]], [[1982]]. Over 10,000 people voted in a contest held by local newspapers to select the name,<ref>{{cite news |first=Lawrie |last=Mifflin |coauthors=Katz, Michael |title=SCOUTING; 'Jersey Devils' Wins Name Poll |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40E17F8395F0C738FDDAF0894DA484D81&n=Top%2fNews%2fSports%2fHockey%2fNational%20Hockey%20League%2fNew%20Jersey%20Devils

In the following season, the Devils were publicly humiliated by [[Wayne Gretzky]] after they were blown out 13-4 by his team, the [[Edmonton Oilers]]. Gretzky was upset that former teammate [[Ron Low]] played for what he considered an inferior team, and in a post-game interview said:

{{cquote|Well, it's time they got their act together, folks. They're ruining the whole league. They had better stop running a [[Mickey Mouse Operation|Mickey Mouse organization]] and put somebody on ice.<ref name="mickeymouse">{{cite web|url=http://www.cyber-kat.com/njdevils/history.html|title=a History of the NJ Devils Hockey Team|publisher=Kat's Devils Den|accessdate=2006-03-25}}</ref>}}

Later, Gretzky publicly admitted that his comment went too far, but privately maintained that his comment was accurate.<ref name="gretzkyapology">{{cite web|url=http://couchpotatohockey.com/Teams/Team%20Biographies/New_Jersey.asp|title=New Jersey Devils Team Biography|publisher=Couchpotatohockey|accessdate=2007-07-06}}</ref> In response, many Devils fans wore Mickey Mouse apparel when the Oilers returned to New Jersey.<ref name="mickeymouse" />

In the [[1983-84 NHL season|1983–84 season]], the Devils hosted the annual [[NHL All-Star Game]] at the Brendan Byrne Arena. [[Chico Resch]] was the winning goaltender, and Devils defenseman [[Joe Cirella]] tallied a goal as the Wales Conference beat the Campbell Conference 7–6.<ref name="datesinhistory" /> However, the team did not achieve much success. Head coach [[Bill MacMillan]] was fired midway through the season and replaced with [[Tom McVie]], and the Devils won only 17 games. After the season, McVie was replaced by [[Doug Carpenter]].

Meanwhile, the Devils had begun building a nucleus of young players. [[John MacLean (ice hockey)|John MacLean]], [[Kirk Muller]], and [[Pat Verbeek]] all complemented the veteran leadership of Resch. The team's record improved each season between 1984 and 1987.  However, the presence of the powerful Islanders, Flyers and Capitals in the [[Patrick Division]] meant that the Devils found themselves in a losing battle  with the Rangers and [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] for the division's last playoff spot.  The Devils actually finished last in the Patrick in 1986 and 1987 despite improving their record.

Hoping to light a spark under the team, McMullen hired [[Providence College]] coach and athletic director [[Lou Lamoriello]] as team president in April 1987.  Lamoriello appointed himself [[general manager]] shortly before the [[1987-88 NHL season|1987–88 season]].  This move came as a considerable surprise to NHL circles.  Although Lamoriello had been a college coach for 19 years, he had never played, coached, or managed in the NHL and was almost unknown outside the American college hockey community.

The 1987–88 Devils garnered the first winning record in the franchise's 13-year history. On the final day of the regular season, they were tied with their nemesis, the Rangers, for the final playoff spot in the Patrick Division. After New York defeated the [[Quebec Nordiques]] 3–0, all eyes were on the Devils, who were playing the Blackhawks in Chicago. The Devils were trailing 3-2 midway through the third period when John MacLean tied the game, and with two minutes left in overtime, he added the winning goal.  Although the Rangers and Devils both finished with 82 points, the Devils had one more win, sending them to the playoffs for the second time in franchise history.<ref>http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nhl/nj/njdevils.html New Jersey Devils on SportsEcyclopedia</ref>

The team made it all the way to the conference finals, but lost to the [[Boston Bruins]] in seven games. In that series, head coach [[Jim Schoenfeld]] verbally abused referee [[Don Koharski]] after the third game, screaming obscenities.  During the exchange, Koharski slipped and fell against the wall.  He immediately claimed that Schoenfeld had pushed him, but Schoenfeld retorted that Koharski had fallen down.  As Koharski snapped that Schoenfeld was "gone," Schoenfeld replied, "Good, 'cause you fell, you fat pig.  Have another donut!"  League disciplinarian [[Brian O'Neill]] ordered Schoenfeld to sit out game four.  The Devils demanded a hearing, but O'Neill refused.  Claiming their rights as well as Schoenfeld's had been violated, the Devils appealed to [[New Jersey Superior Court]] judge James F. Madden--an unprecedented appeal to authority outside the league.  Forty minutes before game time, Madden ordered the suspension overturned pending a formal league hearing.  In his order, Madden pointed out that the NHL's investigation consisted of two phone calls--one to Koharski and one to Schoenfeld--and criticized O'Neill for not reviewing the videotape.  In protest, referee Dave Newell and linesmen Gord Broseker and Ray Scapinello refused to work the game. After more than an hour's delay, three off-ice officials--Paul McInnis, Jim Sullivan and Vin Godleski--were tracked down to work the game.  McInnis served as the referee, while Sullivan and Godleski worked the lines wearing yellow scrimmage sweaters.  Notably, league president [[John Ziegler (sports administrator)|John Ziegler]] was away on personal business and could not be contacted, leaving [[Chicago Blackhawks]] owner [[Bill Wirtz]], as chairman of the league's board of governors, to give the order to play the game with backup officials.<ref name="Fischler">{{cite book |title=Cracked Ice:  An Insider's Look at the NHL |last=Fischler |first=Stan |authorlink=Stan Fischler |coauthors= |year=1999 |publisher=Masters Press |location=[[Lincolnwood, Illinois]] |isbn=1570282196}}</ref>

Ziegler conducted a hearing on [[May 10]], and suspended Schoenfeld for game five and fined him $1,000; the Devils were fined $10,000. Schoenfeld later admitted he regretted his comments.  Nonetheless, Devils fans and broadcasters claimed that the officials shortchanged them for several years afterward.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hockeydraftcentral.com/1972/72005.html|title=Jim Schoenfeld: The Koharski Incident|publisher=HockeyDraftCentral.com}}</ref><ref name="Fischler"/>

[[1988-89 NHL season|The next season]], the Devils once again slipped below .500 and missed the playoffs. Lamoriello made several postseason player changes, notably signing of the first two [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] stars to play in the NHL: [[Viacheslav Fetisov]] and [[Sergei Starikov]]. The Devils drafted Fetisov years earlier in the [[1983 NHL Entry Draft|1983 entry draft]], but the Soviet government did not allow Fetisov, who was an army officer as well as a member of the [[Soviet national ice hockey team|national team]], to leave the country.<ref>http://www.legendsofhockey.net/html/spot_oneononep200101.htm One On One with Viacheslav Fetisov</ref> Shortly after, the Devils signed Fetisov's defense partner, [[Alexei Kasatonov]].

The team changed coaches midway through each of the next two seasons. Schoenfeld was replaced with [[John Cunniff]] in [[1989-90 NHL season|1989–90]], and Tom McVie was re-hired midway through the [[1990-91 NHL season|1990–91 season]] and helmed the team through its third-straight first-round elimination in [[1991-92 NHL season|1991–92]]. [[Herb Brooks]], who coached the 1980 "[[Miracle on Ice]]" team, was brought in for the [[1992-93 NHL season|1992–93 season]], but when the team yet again was eliminated in the first round, he was fired and replaced with former [[Montreal Canadiens]] coach [[Jacques Lemaire]].<ref name="sportsnj">{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nhl/nj/njdevils.html|title=New Jersey Devils history|work=Sports E-Cyclopedia|publisher=Tank Productions|date=[[March 25]], [[2006]]|accessdate=2006-03-25}}</ref>

====1993&ndash;2000====
Under Lemaire, the team roared through the [[1993-94 NHL season|1993–94 regular season]] with a lineup including defensemen [[Scott Stevens]], [[Scott Niedermayer]], and [[Ken Daneyko]], forwards [[Stephane Richer]], John MacLean, [[Bobby Holik]], and [[Claude Lemieux]], and goaltenders [[Chris Terreri]] and [[Martin Brodeur]], who was honored as the league's top rookie with the [[Calder Memorial Trophy]].<ref name="Calder">{{cite web|url=http://statshockey.homestead.com/calder.html| title = NHL Calder Trophy Winners| accessdate = 2006-11-25| publisher = Stats Hockey}}</ref> The Devils' first 100-point season earned them the NHL's second-best record behind the [[New York Rangers]].  However, due to the NHL's new playoff format, the Devils were seeded third in the East, behind the Rangers and Penguins.  The Devils and Rangers met in a memorable Eastern Conference Finals match up, which went seven games. The Devils had lost all six regular season meetings to the Blueshirts, but let the world know they were up for the challenge, after [[Stephane Richer]] scored the game winning goal in the second overtime of Game One. Going into Game 6, the Devils led the series 3-2. Before the game Rangers captain [[Mark Messier]] made his famous guarantee that the Rangers would win Game 6. Keeping true to his word, Messier led his team back, netting a natural hat trick, and leading the Rangers to a 4-2 victory (after the Devils were up 2–0). In game seven, the Devils' [[Valeri Zelepukin]] tied the deciding game with 7.7 seconds remaining, but the Devils were defeated in double overtime, on a goal by [[Stephane Matteau]].  Devils fans, however, claimed that [[Esa Tikkanen]] was in the crease, and the goal should have been wiped out.<ref name="Fischler"/>  Nonetheless, the series is viewed by many hockey fans as one of the greatest playoff series in NHL history.

Despite the setback, the team returned to the Eastern Conference Finals during the [[1994–95 NHL lockout|lockout-shortened]] [[1994-95 NHL season|1995 season]] and defeated the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] four games to two. They swept the heavily favored [[Detroit Red Wings]] to win New Jersey's first-ever Stanley Cup, and the first major professional sports championship in the state's history.  [[Claude Lemieux]] was awarded the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] as playoffs MVP.  The Devils established an NHL record by posting 11 road victories in one playoff season. The success also came amid constant rumors that the team would move for the third time in its history to [[Nashville]].<ref>{{cite news |first = Susan|last=Keller |title = New Jersey Daily Briefing; Suing Over Meadowlands Lease |url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE6DA103FF934A15756C0A963958260&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fOrganizations%2fN%2fNew%20Jersey%20Sports%20and%20Exposition%20Authority |publisher = [[The New York Times]]|date=[[May 27]], [[1995]]|accessdate = 2006-08-30}}</ref> [[Image:1995Devils.jpg|thumb|275px|right|The 1994–95 Stanley Cup champions]]

The Devils missed the playoffs by 2 points the following season, with a 37-33-12 record.  They were beaten by the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] for the last playoff spot in the East on the last day of the season.  It marked the first time in 26 years that a defending Cup champion failed to reach the playoffs.  Throughout the remainder of the decade, the Devils failed to live up to expectations.  They were ousted by the [[New York Rangers]] in the second round of the 1997 playoffs, and were eliminated in the first round by the [[Ottawa Senators]] and the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] the next two seasons.

But in the [[1999-2000 NHL season|1999–00]] season, however, they reached the top again, defeating the defending champion [[Dallas Stars]] in six games to win the Stanley Cup for the second time. Stevens, Holik, Lemieux, Niedermayer, and Brodeur, all integral parts of the 1995 team, were augmented with new players acquired in the intervening five years including [[Patrik Elias]], [[Petr Sykora]], [[Jason Arnott]], [[Alexander Mogilny]], and rookies [[Brian Rafalski]], [[John Madden (ice hockey)|John Madden]], and Calder Trophy recipient [[Scott Gomez]]. A highlight of the Devils' second championship run was their come-from-behind victory in the conference finals. They trailed the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] three games to one, but rebounded to win the three straight games and the series. This was both the first time in Devils playoff history and in NHL Conference Finals history that a 3-1 deficit was surmounted.<ref name="2000ConfFinal">{{cite web|url=http://www.philly.com/mld/dailynews/16002345.htm| title = God Bless 'Em Anyway| accessdate = 2006-11-30| publisher = [[Philadelphia Daily News]]| last=Bowen|first=Les| date=2000-05-27}}</ref> This series was also remembered for the bone crushing hit that team captain [[Scott Stevens]] laid on Flyers captain [[Eric Lindros]], effectively ending Lindros' career in Philadelphia. Stevens was named the winner of the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]],<ref name="ConnSmythe">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/trophies/smythe.html| title = NHL Conn Smythe Trophy Winners| accessdate = 2006-11-25| publisher = NHL.com}}</ref> and assisted on [[Jason Arnott]]'s [[Stanley Cup]] clinching goal in double-overtime of Game 6 in Dallas.

Shortly before this victory, McMullen sold the team to Puck Holdings, an affiliate of [[YankeeNets]], for $175 million. The owners wanted to use the Devils and the [[New Jersey Nets]] (also a tenant at CAA) for programming on the [[YES Network]] and move both teams to a new arena in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]]. Neither of these proposals became reality under Puck Holdings' ownership.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2004/1129/124_print.html|title=Ice Capades|last=Ozanian|first=Michael|date=[[2004]]-[[11-29]]|publisher=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=2006-08-31}}</ref> The new owners largely left the Devils' operations in Lamoriello's hands.  For the start of the next season, Lamoriello was appointed [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of both the Devils and Nets. He remained at the helm of the basketball team until it was sold with the intention of moving it to [[Brooklyn]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/story/157436p-138260c.html|title=Lou will leave Nets,

====2001&ndash;2004====
Led by the Elias-Arnott-Sykora line (The A Line) and the stellar play of goaltender [[Martin Brodeur]], the Devils reached the [[2001 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup Finals]] for the second straight year in [[2000-01 NHL season|2001]]. They lost the series to the [[Colorado Avalanche]] despite leading 3-2 and having game six on home ice.  The team's strong regular season was recognized at the NHL's annual awards that year, with Madden becoming the first player in franchise history to win the [[Frank J. Selke Trophy]] (for top defensive forward), along with Brodeur and Stevens named as finalists for the [[Vezina Trophy]] (top goalie) and [[James Norris Memorial Trophy|Norris Trophy]] (top defensemen) awards respectively.

In the [[2001-02 NHL season|2001–02]] season, they were expected to be contenders once again,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/inside_game/darren_eliot/news/2002/04/14/east_breakdown/|title=Devil of a surge: New Jersey looking good to come out of the East|last=Eliot|first=Darren|date=[[2002]]-[[04-14]]|publisher=[[CNN]]/[[Sports Illustrated]]|accessdate=2006-08-30}}</ref> and they finished the season as the 3rd best team in the Atlantic Division, with 95 points.  The Devils entered the playoffs as a 6 seed, but lost in the first round to the number 3 seed [[Carolina Hurricanes]].

[[Image:Stanley Cup Bush Devils.jpg|right|thumb|The Devils present president George W. Bush with a jersey after winning the 2003 Stanley Cup Championship.]]
In [[2002-03 NHL season|2003]], the Devils finished first in the Atlantic Division with 108 points, earning the number 2 seed in the East. Their [[2003 Stanley Cup Playoffs|playoff]] run included a seven-game conference final series victory, decided in the final three minutes on a goal by newly acquired forward [[Jeff Friesen]], over the [[Ottawa Senators]], who won the [[President's Trophy]] that season. In the Stanley Cup Finals, the Devils and [[Anaheim Ducks|Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]] had a back and forth battle, with both teams winning only their home games.  The Devils brought the Stanley Cup to [[New Jersey]] a third time, defeating the Ducks in the 7th game of the Finals in New Jersey.   [[Martin Brodeur]], [[Scott Stevens]], [[Scott Niedermayer]], [[Ken Daneyko]], and [[Sergei Brylin]] each won their third Cup, and after the series, Daneyko, a long-time fan favorite,<ref name="Dano">{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/cup/2003-06-10-notes-daneyko_x.htm|title=Veteran Daneyko sees first action in last game|publisher=USA Today|date=2003-06-10|accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref> announced his retirement. Despite Anaheim's loss, the Conn Smythe Trophy for playoff MVP was awarded to their goaltender [[Jean-Sebastien Giguere]] who was the first player not on the championship team to be named playoff MVP since [[Ron Hextall]] in [[1986-87 NHL season|1987]]. Some hockey writers speculated a New Jersey player did not win because there were multiple candidates, resulting in a [[split vote]] among the sportswriters who select the winner.<ref name="PreSmythe03">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2003/06/06/conn_smythe030606.html|title=Who will win the Conn Smythe?|publisher=CBC Sports|accessdate=2006-11-28|date=2003-06-06}}</ref><ref name="GiguereSmythe">{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/cup/2003-06-09-giguere-smythe_x.htm|title=Trophy, stats no consolation for Giguere|publisher=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=2006-11-28|date=2003-06-09|last=Beaton|first=Rod}}</ref> However, Brodeur was awarded the Vezina Trophy as outstanding goaltender in the regular season for the first time in his career.

In the [[2003-04 NHL season|2003–04]] season, Martin Brodeur took home the Vezina Trophy again.  Despite the permanent loss of long time team captain Scott Stevens the Devils finished second in the Atlantic Division with 100 points. With the 6th seed in the [[2004 Stanley Cup Playoffs|Stanley Cup Playoffs]], the Devils lost to the Philadelphia Flyers four games to one.  In March of 2004, near the end of the season, [[Lehman Brothers]] executive [[Jeffrey Vanderbeek]] purchased a controlling interest from Puck Holdings and resigned from Lehman Brothers to assume full-time ownership. He had been a minority owner since the 2000 sale.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/03/sports/hockey/03DEVI.html|title=Wall Street Executive to Buy Devils|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=[[2004]]-[[03-03]]|accessdate=2006-08-30}}</ref>

On [[April 29]], [[2006]], the Devils won their first round Stanley Cup playoff series against the New York Rangers four games to none, extending their winning streak to fifteen games and marking the first time the Devils defeated their cross-river rival in a playoff series. The team's season ended in the next round with an 4-1 Game 5 loss to the [[Carolina Hurricanes]], who eventually won the Stanley Cup.

In the offseason, the Devils hired former [[Montreal Canadiens]] coach [[Claude Julien (ice hockey)|Claude Julien]] to replace Lamoriello behind the bench.<ref>{{cite news |first = Janet |last = Frankston |title = Devils Hire Claude Julien As Coach |url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/13/AR2006061300556.html |publisher = [[Associated Press]] |date = [[June 13]], [[2006]] |accessdate = 2006-08-30}}</ref> However, in the last week of the [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWTx1bTAcVk 2006–2007 Devils season], with just three games left, Julien was fired, and Lamoriello once again reprised his coaching role.<ref>{{cite news |first =  |last =  |title = Julien out, Lamoriello in as Devils prepare for playoffs |url = http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=2822234 |publisher = [[Associated Press]] |date = [[April 2]], [[2007]] |accessdate = 2007-04-02}}</ref> The move is reminiscent of Robbie Ftorek's firing with eight games left in the [[1999-2000 NHL season|1999–00]] season, after which the Devils won the Stanley Cup. Lamoriello defended the move saying, "I don't think we're at a point of being ready both mentally and [physically] to play the way that is necessary going into the playoffs." The Devils went on to win their seventh Atlantic Division title and earn the second seed in the Eastern Conference after finishing ahead of the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] by two points. They defeated the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] in six games in the first round, but struggled against the fourth seeded [[Ottawa Senators]] in the Eastern Conference Semi-Finals and lost to them in five games. Their final loss of the series on [[May 5]], [[2007]] marked the final game of the Devils' 25-year history at the [[Izod Center|Continental Airlines Arena]].

====2007&ndash;present====
The early playoff exit has led to some speculation that this is the "end of an era" for the Devils.<ref name="EndOfEra">{{cite news|author=Canavan, Tom|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/news;_ylt=AhA6XZk7hlx9XTHqqlVv9ksmvLYF?slug=ap-devilswrapup&prov=ap&type=lgns|title=Elimination by Senators marks ends of an era for Devils|accessdate=2007-05-09|date=[[May 6]], [[2007]]|publisher = [[Associated Press]]}}</ref> This proved to be correct, as on [[July 1]], [[2007]], long-time Devils Scott Gomez and Brian Rafalski left the team as unrestricted free agents, Gomez to the rival [[New York Rangers]] and Rafalski to the [[Detroit Red Wings]]. Back-up goalie [[Scott Clemmensen]] went to the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]], and local favorite forward [[Jim Dowd (ice hockey)|Jim Dowd]] opted for free agency. However, the Devils signed Sabre forward [[Dainius Zubrus]] and Ranger defenseman [[Karel Rachunek]] shortly after. On [[July 5]], the Devils signed Rangers goalie [[Kevin Weekes]] as a backup to Brodeur, as well as [[Predators]] defenseman [[Vitali Vishnevski]] on [[July 10]]. Devils' [[Zach Parise]], [[Patrik Elias]], and [[Paul Martin (ice hockey)|Paul Martin]] all signed six year deals each, later that month also. On [[July 13]], [[2007]], [[Brent Sutter]] was named the 14th head coach of the team, along with previous coach [[Larry Robinson]], to aide John MacLean as the second assistant coach. On [[August 7]], [[2007]], the Devils signed former Islander [[Arron Asham]]. After the Devils preseason came to an end, Devils prospects [[Nicklas Bergfors]] and [[David Clarkson (ice hockey)|David Clarkson]] made the final roster. The Devils opened their new arena, the [[Prudential Center]], on [[October 27]], [[2007]] against the [[Ottawa Senators]] after opening the season with a nine game road trip. The game ended with a 4-1 win for Ottawa.  On October 31, 2007, the New Jersey Devils won their first home game at the Prudential Center by beating the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]], 6-1.  Jay Pandolfo was the first Devils player to score a hat trick at the Prudential Center. In a dramatic last game of the season against their rivals the [[New York Rangers]], the Devils won in a shootout, giving them home ice advantage over the Rangers in the playoffs. The Devils lost the series against the Rangers 4-1, losing all three games at the Prudential Center. Following the series conclusion, Martin Brodeur refused to shake Rangers forward [[Sean Avery]]'s hand because of Avery's antics throughout the series. The following week Brodeur became a finalist for the [[Vezina Trophy]] for the eighth time (he won in 2003, 2004, and 2007) and forward [[John Madden (ice hockey)]] became a finalist for the [[Frank J. Selke Trophy]] for the fourth time (having won once in 2000). Results come in June 12.

==Style of play==
The Devils have been known as a defense-first team since [[Jacques Lemaire]]'s tenure, when he implemented a system commonly called the ''[[neutral zone trap]]''.<ref name="unlocktrap">{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCM/is_1_32/ai_107896436|title=Unlocking the Trap &mdash; defense &mdash; Industry Overview|date=November 2003|last=Kreiser|first=John|publisher=Hockey Digest|accessdate=2006-09-03}}</ref> This system is designed to force teams to turn over the puck in the neutral zone leading to a counterattack.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCM/is_3_32/ai_112087316|title=Caught in a trap: almost every team in the NHL has implemented a "system," but what exactly does that mean?|date=January&ndash;February 2004|last=Kreiser|first=John|publisher=Hockey Digest|accessdate=2006-09-03}}</ref> This style of play, coupled with poor attendance and television ratings, led the team to be chastised by the media and hockey fans for "making the NHL boring".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCM/is_3_29/ai_67492141|title=Boring is beautiful: the Devils' defense-first style may be hell to watch, but it's hard to argue with the results|date=January 2001|last=Anderson|first=Chris|publisher=Hockey Digest|accessdate=2006-09-03}}</ref> Nevertheless, the Devils were successful using this style of play, and Devils coach Larry Robinson asserted that the Montreal Canadiens (who also won the Cup many times) he played on in the 1970s used a form of the trap, though it did not have a name.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_38_228/ai_n6206381|title=Scrap the trap&mdash;please|date=2004-09-20|last=Yorio|first=Kara|publisher=[[The Sporting News]]|accessdate=2006-09-03}}</ref>

Under Brent Sutter, the team adopted less of a trap and more of a transitional, "run and gun" style of play to start the 2007-2008 season.<ref name="pressure">{{cite news|url=http://www.sny.tv/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060930&content_id=1410377&oid=36218&vkey=15|title=Devils trying to love pressure|date=September 2006|publisher=SNY.tv|accessdate=2006-11-14}}</ref> This led to many high scoring games early in the 07-08 season for New Jersey, even though they were on the losing end of most of them.  However, after about 20 games the Devils began to fall back into their trapping style.  The team still forechecks more than they used to, causing more offensive zone turnovers, but they are not the "run and gun" team people were hoping they would be.

==Team colors and mascot==
===Logo===
[[Image:OldDevils.png|right|thumb|300px|The old green style jerseys used from 1982 to 1992]]   
[[Image:NewDevils.png|right|thumb|300px|The current jerseys used since 1992.]]

The Devils' logo is a [[monogram]] of the letters "N" and "J", rendered with two devil horns at the top of the "J" and a pointed tail at the bottom. The monogram is red with a black outline, and sits inside an open black circle. The logo lays on a field of white in the middle of the chest on both uniforms. Prior to the 1992-93 season, the black circle and outline were green.

===Jerseys===
The current team colors are red, black and white, and they can be seen on both the home and road jerseys. The home jersey, which was the team's road jersey until 2003 when the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] decided to switch home and road jerseys,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statenews.com/article.phtml?pk=15112|title=NHL 'quacked' up with hockey jersey switch|first=Kristofer|last=Karol|publisher=[[State News]]|date=[[January 27]], [[2003]]|accessdate=2006-08-30}}</ref> is dominantly red in color. There are three black and white stripes, one across each arm and one across the waist. The road jersey is the team's former home jersey, white in color with a similar design, except that the three stripes are black and red. The shoulders are draped with black on both uniforms. Before 1993, the uniforms were green and red with slightly different striping<ref name="sportsnj" /> leading some fans to affectionately refer to them as "[[Christmas]] colors".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epinions.com/content_1533780100|title=Every well dressed hockey fan wears a sweater|publisher=Epinions.com|date=2001-05-01|accessdate=2008-03-09}}</ref> The Devils have yet to introduce a [[third jersey]], and are one of only 3 NHL teams (Detroit and Carolina are the others) to never have one.

===Mascot===
The current mascot is "NJ Devil", a {{convert|7|ft|m|sing=on}} tall devil who plays into the myth of the [[Jersey Devil]]. NJ Devil keeps the crowd excited, signs autographs, participates in entertainment during the intermissions, skates across the ice, and runs throughout the aisles of the arena to high five fans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newjerseydevils.com/2003/community/mascot.html|title=NJ Devil &mdash; The Official Mascot of the New Jersey Devils|publisher=New Jersey Devils|year=2003|accessdate=2006-08-30}}</ref>

Prior to 1993, the mascot was "Slapshot", a large Devils [[hockey puck]] that interacted with the fans. However, the man inside the costume resigned after he was accused of improperly touching three women while in costume.  The lawsuit and all charges were dropped as nothing could be proven. However, to remove the stigma of the lawsuit, Slapshot was retired and has not returned since<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.citypaper.net/articles/112901/cs.cover2.shtml|title=Former Eagles mascot Dean Schoenewald is still crazy after all these years|date=[[November 29]], [[2001]]|first=Jon|last=Hart|accessdate=2006-08-30}}</ref>
