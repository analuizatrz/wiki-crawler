'''Our Lady of Guadalupe''', also called the '''Virgin of Guadalupe''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe or Virgen de Guadalupe) is a 16th century [[Roman Catholic]] Mexican [[icon]] depicting an [[Marian apparition|apparition of the Virgin Mary]]. It is Mexico's most beloved religious and cultural image. Our Lady of Guadalupe is known in Mexico as "La Virgen Morena", which means "The brown-skinned Virgin". Guadalupe's feast day is celebrated on [[December 12]], commemorating the traditional account of her appearances to [[Juan Diego Cuauhtlatoatzin]] on the hill of [[Tepeyac]] near [[Mexico City]] from [[December 9]], [[1531]] through [[December 12]], [[1531]].

The Virgin of Guadalupe is a cultural symbol of significant importance to the Mexican identity. Mexican Catholics believe that Guadalupe was a manifestation of the [[Virgin Mary]] in the [[Americas]]. 

Some historians speculate the icon was meant to [[syncretic]]ally represent both the [[Virgin Mary]] and the indigenous Mexican goddess [[Tonantzin]], providing a way for 16th century Spaniards to gain converts among the indigenous population of early Mexico. It may have provided a method for 16th century indigenous Mexicans to covertly practice their native religion, although the contrary was asserted in the canonization process of Juan Diego.<ref>Guerrero Rosado, José L. Los dos mundos de un indio santo. 1991, Mexico</ref> 

The Virgin of Guadalupe has also symbolized the Mexican nation since Mexico's [[Mexican War of Independence|War of Independence]]. Both [[Miguel Hidalgo]] and [[Emiliano Zapata]]'s armies traveled underneath Guadalupan flags, and ''Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe'' is generally recognized as a symbol of all Mexicans. The Mexican novelist [[Carlos Fuentes]] once said that "...one may no longer consider himself a Christian, but you cannot truly be considered a Mexican unless you believe in the Virgin of Guadalupe."<ref>Demarest, Donald.

==History==
===Traditional account of the apparition===
[[Image:Posada guadalupe.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Etching by Jose Guadalupe Posada, depicting St. Juan Diego and the Virgin image miraculous imprinted on the cloth where he collected the roses.]]
[[Image:Juan de Zumarraga.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Spanish bishop, Fray [[Juan de Zumárraga]] did not believe [[Juan Diego]]'s account and asked for a [[miracle]].]]
According to Catholic accounts of the Guadalupan apparition, during a walk from his village to the city on [[December 9]], [[1531]], [[Juan Diego]] saw a vision of a [[Virgin]] at the Hill of [[Tepeyac]]. Speaking in [[Nahuatl]], Our Lady of Guadalupe said to build an [[abbey]] on the site, but when Juan Diego spoke to the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[bishop]], Fray [[Juan de Zumárraga]], the prelate asked for a miraculous sign. So the Virgin told Juan Diego to gather [[flower]]s from the hill, even though it was [[winter]], when normally nothing bloomed. He found Spanish [[rose]]s, gathered them on his [[Tilmàtli|tilma]], and presented these to the bishop. According to tradition, when the roses fell from it the [[icon]] of the Virgin of Guadalupe appeared imprinted on the cloth.

Historians evaluate<ref>José L. Guerrero Rosado "El Manto de Juan Diego", & others</ref> the reality of the apparitions by the sudden, extraordinary success of the evangelizing of the Indians in the decade of 1531–1541, which constitutes the most successful evangelization ever.{{Fact|date=October 2007}} In this short period close to ten million Indians adopted Christianity, contrasted with the previous decade in which rejection was the norm. Depression and apathy suddenly gave way to enthusiasm and Indians built more churches, as free labor, than many nations had in Europe. In a single small town, Cholula, 365 churches were built; one for each day of the year to commemorate each saint on his own festivity. Puebla acquired its name because the huge bells for the Cathedral were so heavy they had to remain on the ground. One morning they were heard tolling in place, a feat attributed to the angels, thus Puebla's name of "Puebla de Nuestra Señora de los Ángeles—Puebla of Our Lady of the Angels."<ref>Mexican Tourist Department</ref>

==Symbol of Mexico==
Guadalupe's first major use as a nationalistic symbol was in the writing of [[Miguel Sanchez (writer)|Miguel Sánchez]], the author of the first [[Spanish language]] apparition account. Sanchez identified Guadalupe as [[Revelation]]'s [[Woman of the Apocalypse]], and said that <blockquote>"this New World has been won and conquered by the hand of the Virgin Mary...[who had] prepared, disposed, and contrived her exquisite likeness in this her Mexican land, which was conquered for such a glorious purpose, won that there should appear so Mexican an image."<ref name="brading">Brading, D.A. Mexican Phoenix. Our Lady of Guadalupe: Image and Tradition Across Five Centuries. Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, 2001.</ref></blockquote>

In 1810 [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] initiated the bid for Mexican independence with his ''[[Grito de Dolores]],'' yelling words to the effect of "[[Death]] to the [[Spaniards]] and long live the Virgin of Guadalupe!" When Hidalgo's mestizo-indigenous army attacked [[Guanajuato]] and [[Valladolid]], they placed "the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe, which was the insignia of their enterprise, on sticks or on reeds painted different colors"  and "they all wore a print of the Virgin on their hats."<ref name="krauze">Krauze, Enrique. Mexico, Biography of Power. A History of Modern Mexico 1810-1996. HarperCollins: New York, 1997.</ref>
[[Image:Guadalupano.jpg|Guadalupanflag|thumb|right|250px|Flag carried by Hidalgo and his insurgent army.]]

When Hidalgo died, leadership of the revolution fell to a mestizo priest named [[Jose Maria Morelos]] who led insurgent troops in the Mexican south. Morelos was also a Guadalupan partisan: he made the Virgin the seal of his [[Congress of Chilpancingo]], stating <blockquote>"New Spain puts less faith in its own efforts than in the power of God and the intercession of its Blessed Mother, who appeared within the precincts of Tepeyac as the miraculous image of Guadalupe that had come to comfort us, defend us, visibly be our protection."<ref name="krauze"/></blockquote>  He inscribed the Virgin's feast day, [[December 12]], into the [[Chilpancingo]] constitution, and declared that Guadalupe was the power behind his military victories. One of Morelos' officers, a man named [[Guadalupe Victoria|Felix Fernandez]] who would later become the first Mexican president, even changed his name to Guadalupe Victoria.<ref name="krauze"/>

[[Simón Bolívar]], noticed the Guadalupan theme in these uprisings, and shortly before Morelos' death in 1815 wrote: <blockquote>"...the leaders of the independence struggle have put [[fanaticism]] to use by proclaiming the famous Virgin of Guadalupe as the queen of the patriots, praying to her in times of hardship and displaying her on their [[flag]]s...the [[veneration]] for this image in Mexico far exceeds the greatest reverence that the shrewdest [[prophet]] might inspire."<ref name="brading"/></blockquote>

In 1914, [[Emiliano Zapata]]'s peasant army rose out of the south against the government of [[Porfirio Diaz]]. Though Zapata's rebel forces were primarily interested in [[land reform]]—"tierra y libertad" (land and liberty) was the [[slogan]] of the uprising—when Zapata's peasant troops penetrated [[Mexico City]], they carried Guadalupan banners.<ref>Documentary footage of Zapata and Pancho Villa's armies entering Mexico City can be seen [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_wAoEqeHKU here]—Zapata's men can be seen carrying the flag of the Guadalupana about 38 seconds in.</ref>

The Virgin of Guadalupe has also symbolized the Mexican nation since Mexico's [[Mexican War of Independence|War of Independence]]. Both [[Miguel Hidalgo]] and [[Emiliano Zapata]]'s armies traveled underneath Guadalupan flags. The Mexican novelist [[Carlos Fuentes]] once said that "...one may no longer consider himself a Christian, but you cannot truly be considered a Mexican unless you believe in the Virgin of Guadalupe."<ref>Demarest, Donald.  "Guadalupe Cult...In the Lives of Mexicans." p. 114 in ''A Handbook on Guadalupe'', Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate, eds. Waite Park MN: Park Press Inc, 1996</ref>

More recently, the contemporary Zapatista National Liberation Army ([[EZLN]]) named their "mobile city" in honor of the Virgin: it is called Guadalupe Tepeyac. EZLN spokesperson [[Subcomandante Marcos]] wrote a humorous letter in 1995 describing the EZLN bickering over what to do with a Guadalupe statue they had received as a gift.<ref>Subcomandante Marcos, "Zapatistas Guadalupanos and the Virgin of Guadalupe."  24 March 1995 [http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/mexico/ezln/marcos_virgin_mar95.html], accessed 11 December 2006.</ref>

===Mestizo culture and Mexican identity===
Guadalupe is often considered a mixture of the cultures which blend to form Mexico, both racially<ref>Beckwith, Barbara.  "A View From the North." St. Anthony Messenger Magazine Online. December 1999. [http://www.americancatholic.org/Messenger/Dec1999/feature2.asp], accessed 3 December 2006.</ref> and religiously<ref name="guide">Elizondo, Virgil.  "Our Lady of Guadalupe.

[[Image:Our Lady of Guadalupe--graffiti in East Los Angeles.JPG|thumb|left|275px|Graffiti mural in Los Angeles showing [[Guadalupe|Our Lady of Guadalupe]] in a [[nopal]] cactus.]]

One theory is that the Virgin of Guadalupe was presented to the [[Aztec]]s as a sort of  "[[Christianization|Christianized]]" [[Tonantzin]], necessary for the clergymen to convert the Indians to their Faith. As Jacques Lafaye wrote in ''Quetzalcoatl and Guadalupe'', "...as the Christians built their first churches with the rubble and the columns of the ancient pagan temples, so they often borrowed pagan customs for their own cult purposes."<ref name="lafay">Lafaye, Jacques. ''Quetzalcoatl and Guadalupe. The Formation of Mexican National Consciousness.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press. 1976</ref> An alternate view is that Guadalupe-Tonantzin gave the native Americans a hidden method to continue worshipping their own goddess in a Christianized form; similar patterns of [[syncretic]] worship can be seen throughout the Catholic Americas (e.g. [[Vodun]], [[Santería]]). Guadalupan religious syncretism is both lauded<ref name="guide"/> and disparaged as demonic.<ref>Scheifler, Michael.  "The Aztec Goddess Tonantzin and the Feast of Guadalupe." Bible Light Homepage.  [http://www.aloha.net/~mikesch/aztec.htm], accessed 3 December 2006</ref>

Some theologians also associate the Virgin of Guadalupe with a special relationship between the indigenous peoples of the American continents and the Catholic Church. This perspective developed as the scriptural terms of truths "hid ... from the wise and prudent" but "revealed...unto babes" ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 11:25), but later developed into the "spiritual [[Mestizo|mestizaje]] of the Americas",<ref name="elizondo">Elizondo, Virgil.  ''Guadalupe, Mother of a New Creation.'' Maryknoll, New York: Orbis Books, 1997</ref> and the "option for the poor" provided by [[Liberation theology]].

The author Judy King asserts that Guadalupe is a "common denominator" uniting Mexicans. Writing that Mexico is composed of a vast patchwork of differences—linguistic, ethnic, and class-based—King says "The Virgin of Guadalupe is the rubber band that binds this disparate nation into a whole."<ref name="king">King, Judy. "La Virgen de Guadalupe—Mother of All Mexico." [http://www.mexconnect.com/mex_/travel/jking/jkguadalupe.html], accessed 29 November 2006</ref>

This sentiment was echoed by two celebrants interviewed in the New York Times at the Virgin's feast day in 1998:  "We say that we are more Guadalupanos than Mexicans," said the Jesuit Brother Joel Magallan. "We say that because our Lady Guadalupe is our symbol, our identity."  David Solanas, another feast-goer, agreed, saying "We have faith in her. She's like the mama of all the Mexicans."<ref>Herszenhorn, David M. "Mexicans Unite to Honor Their Spiritual Mother." December 13, 1998, New York Times, Section 1, Page 51.</ref>

The origin of the name "Guadalupe" is controversial. According to a sixteenth-century report the Virgin identified herself as Guadalupe when she appeared to Juan Diego's uncle, [[Juan Bernardino]].<ref>"Why the name 'of Guadalupe'?" sancta.org [http://www.sancta.org/nameguad.html], accessed 30 November 2006</ref> It has also been suggested that "Guadalupe" is a corruption of a [[Nahuatl]] name "Coatlaxopeuh", which has been translated as "Who Crushes the Serpent.<ref>Mendoza, Rubi.  "Coatlaxopeuh or Guadalupe?"  xispas.com [http://www.xispas.com/archives/virgin/virgin.htm]</ref> In this interpretation, the serpent referred to is [[Quetzalcoatl]], one of the chief [[Aztec mythology|Aztec gods]], whom the Virgin Mary "crushed" by inspiring the conversion of indigenous people to Catholicism. However, many historians believe that the 1533 Guadalupan shrine was dedicated to the Spanish Lady of Guadalupe in Extremadura—not to the Mexican Virgin venerated today. Thus, while the name "Guadalupe" would have had certain connotations to Nahuatl speakers, as noted above, its ultimate origins would be the Arabic-Latin term "Wadī Lupum", meaning "Valley of the Wolf".

''María Guadalupe,'' or just ''Lupe,'' is a common female and male name among Mexican people or those with Mexican heritage.

==Documentation==
A number of documents are used to support the apparition account. The most important may be the Nahuatl-language ''[[Huei tlamahuiçoltica]]'' ("The Great Event") which contains [[Nican mopohua]] ("Here it is recounted"), a tract about the Virgin which contains the aforementioned story. [[Huei tlamahuiçoltica]] is said to have been written by Antonio Valeriano in 1556; it was printed in Nahuatl by Luis Lasso de la Vega in 1649.

Sixteen pages of a battered partial manuscript of the Nican Mopohua, dating c. 1556, can be found at the Public Library of New York. It's been there since 1880 together with two later copies, one of which is complete. The older copy has been recently reprinted in facsimile by Miguel León-Portilla in his ''Tonanzin Guadalupe''. An even older manuscript exists in Nahuatl which precedes the Nican Mopohua: it is known as the "Primitive Relation" of the apparitions, is much shorter, and is conserved in The National Library of México. Well known codices testifying to the apparition—some of which appear listed below as XVI century codices—have been studied, commented on, and published by Mario Cuevas and others.

"El Pregón del Atabal" (The Drummer's Proclamation), attributed to Francisco Plácido—Lord of Azcapotzalco—was performed (according to Florencia who received it from Sigüenza and was later taken up by Cuevas) in the procession which transferred the Image from the primitive Cathedral to the tiny first church at Tepeyac on [[December 26]] [[1531]]. It is famous for the line "God created you, Oh Holy Mary, amongst abundant flowers / and made you born again, by painting you at the bishopric." In other words, the image was not on the ayate when the flowers fell, it appeared suddenly before the Bishop. The poem is part of a manuscript known as "Cantares Mexicanos," which can be found at the Biblioteca Nacional (National Library).

There are also several XVI century codices: the "Tira de Tepexpan", "Aztactepec", "Ermitaño", "Heye", etc.; all in museums in several cities: México, Puebla, Paris and New York; and the recently discovered [[Codex Escalada]], a pictographic account of the Virgin on [[Tepeyac]], painted on deerskin and dated 1548. Another valuable XVI Century source is Indian writings in Nahuatl using Latin letters and drawings: "Anales de Juan Bautista", Anales de Tlaltelolco", etc. Full listings are given by de la Torre in "Testimonios históricos guadalupanos". There is also a seventeenth-century [[Stradanus engraving|engraving by Samuel Stradanus]] which used the Virgin's image to advertise [[indulgences]].<ref>"Our Lady of Guadalupe. Historical sources."  L'Osservatore Romano. 23 January 2002, page 8</ref> The first Spanish-language narrative about the apparitions, called ''Imagen de la Virgen María'' ("Image of the Virgin Mary"), was written by Fr. Miguel Sánchez and printed in 1648.

The apparition account is also strengthened by a document called the ''Informaciones Jurídicas'' of 1666, a collection of oral interviews gathered near Juan Diego's hometown of [[Cuautitlan]]. In the "Informaciones Jurídicas," various witnesses affirmed, in interview format, basic details about Saint Juan Diego and the Guadalupan apparition story.<ref name="poole">Poole, Stafford. Our Lady of Guadalupe. The Origins and Sources of a Mexican National Symbol, 1531-1797. University of Arizona Press: Tucson, 1995.</ref>

Some historians and clerics, including the U.S. priest-historian Fr. [[Stafford Poole]], the famous Mexican historian [[Joaquín García Icazbalceta]], and former abbot of the [[Basilica of Guadalupe]], [[Guillermo Schulenburg]], have expressed doubts about the accuracy of the apparition accounts. Schulenburg in particular caused a stir with his 1996 interview with the [[Catholic]] magazine ''Ixthus,'' when he said that Juan Diego was "a symbol, not a reality."<ref>Daily Catholic. December 7, 1999.  [http://www.dailycatholic.org/issue/archives/1999Dec/232dec7,vol.10,no.232txt/dec7nv4.htm], accessed November 30, 2006</ref><ref>Schulenburg was not the first to disbelieve the traditional account nor the first Catholic prelate to resign his post after questioning the Guadalupe story. In [[1897]] Eduardo Sanchez Camacho, the [[Bishop]] of [[Tamaulipas]] was forced to leave his post after expressing similar disbelief. "Divided by an Apparition." New York Times. September 5, 1896; p. 3. However, Bishop Camacho's objections—based on García Icazbalceta's arguments—were taken up immediately by Fr. Agustín de la Rosa in his "Defensa de la aparición de Ntra. Sra. de Guadalupe" (1896); de la Torre Villar, Ernesto, y Navarro de Anda, Ramiro. "Testimonios Históricos Guadalupanos." Fondo de Cultura Económica, 1982 </ref> 

The [[Codex Escalada]], a painting on deerskin which illustrates the apparition and discusses [[Juan Diego]]'s death, was used to shore up [[Juan Diego]]'s 1990s [[canonization]] process. Critics, including [[Stafford Poole]] and [[David A. Brading]], find the document suspicious—partly because of when it was discovered, and partly because it contains the handiwork of both [[Antonio Valeriano]] (a man many apparition partisans believe to be the true author of the [[Nican mopohua]]) and the signature of [[Bernardino de Sahagún]], the [[Franciscan]] missionary and anthropologist. Brading said that: [[Image:Codice1548 chico.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Codex Escalada.]]
<blockquote>"Within the context of the Christian tradition, it was rather like finding a picture of [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]]'s vision of [[Christ]] on the road to [[Damascus]], drawn by [[St. Luke]] and signed by [[St. Peter]]".<ref name="brading"/></blockquote> 

However, Brading's quip rather than leading to unbelief might be the confirmation of authenticity needed, as it brings to light the difference between St. Luke and St. Peter on one hand; and Valeriano and Sahagún on the other on a simple question: what reason could the first party of Luke and Peter have had to: first, draw the vision; and then, sign the drawing? None of course, absolutely none! What about Valeriano and Sahagún? Valeriano had very good and commonplace reasons: Valeriano was a Colonial authority dependent on the Viceroy, and a short biography stating the following facts is found in "Testimonios Históricos Guadalupanos". He began as Governor of San Juan, and on proof of his great personal competence he was appointed as Governor to all Mexican Indians, a post he held for 35 years. So, in his official capacity he had the Official Seal of Authenticity on these matters. It would have been one of the most commonplace operations of his job. Valeriano was Sahagún most brilliant disciple, and lifelong associate; thus, as attaching two signatures is normally required by law as would pertain Valeriano's official functions, there is an adequate basis for admitting this particular codex as historical evidence. 
 
At the time of the apparitions in 1531, [[Juan de Zumárraga|Zumárraga]] was Bishop-elect: he would be formally consecrated in [[1533]] and became an Archbishop in 1547.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Juan de Zumárraga|author=Camillus Crivelli}}</ref> There is no explicit mention of Juan Diego nor the Virgin in any of Zumárraga's conserved writings (which historians, mainly Cuevas, attribute to wanton destruction by opponents of the faith). One letter may be an exception, an exultant letter of his to Hernán Cortes which though unsigned with his name, is signed as follows: "De V.S. Capellán, El electo regocijado" - meaning "The rejoicing chosen one (chosen by the Virgin), and Chaplain to your Lordship", and which refers, in 1531, to the festivity of [[The Immaculate Conception]] which was celebrated from [[December 8]] to [[December 17]] according to the Sevillian Missal then in use in Mexico. One phrase in the letter, "The great mercy which God and His mother have made to this land you conquered", may refer to the apparitions. This letter was published in the "Album Histórico Guadalupano del IV Centenario" in 1931 by the prominent historian Mariano Cuevas S.J. It is also certain that he did inform on the apparitions officially, as there were witnesses to the fact, and was also established canonically by the Informations of 1666. Additionally, there is a testimony by Pedro Mezquía of a copy being kept in the monastery of Vitoria in Spain many years later. In a catechism published in Mexico before his death, it was stated: “The Redeemer of the world doesn’t want any more [[miracle]]s, because they are no longer necessary."<ref name="poole"/> In this quotation from a catechism, some critics have pretended to read a personal denial of the apparitions, but the author is not Zumárraga and this was not even a first printing; all to the contrary, this was a reprint of an old catechism imported from Spain.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

Guillermo Schulenburg, the Basílica's abbot for over 30 years, declared in 1996 that Juan Diego was a symbol and myth: a character invented to conquer the hearts of the native people and to direct their religious allegiance to the Vatican. He also commissioned a "serious study out of sheer love for truth", which found the Virgin of Guadalupe to be a man-made painting. However, the Vatican disagreed, citing evidence to the contrary, and Juan Diego was [[canonized]] by John Paul II.

As evidence of divine origin, some point to an infrared photograph of the image taken for the Basilica in 1946 by Jesús Cataño, a professional photographer, published in the ''Enciclopedia Guadalupana'' in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://g-infrared.blogspot.com|title=Guadalupan Infra-red|publisher=Luis de Guerrero Osio y Rivas|accessdate=2007-09-09}}</ref>   According to an analysis, ''No brush strokes can be discerned, there is no under drawing, sizing, or over-varnish, and the weave of the rough maguey fibers is itself utilized to give portrait depth, no explanation of the portrait is possible by infrared techniques or by any other known means. It is as unique from a scientific standpoint as the Holy Shroud of Turin.'' Some describe these images as ''αχειροποίητος'', in the classical Greek meaning for supernatural (literally 'painted without use of hands').<ref>{{cite book|title=Acheiropoeta: Not Made By Hands: The Miraculous Image of Our Lady of Guadalupe and the Holy Shroud of Turin |first=Thomas Mary |last=Sennott |publisher=Ignatius Press |year=1999 |oclc=41136016}}</ref><br />

==The image==
===Artistic symbolism===
The image of Our Lady of Guadalupe is often read as a [[Code (cryptography)|coded]] image. Miguel Sanchez, the author of the 1648 tract ''Imagen de la Virgen María'', described the Virgin's image as the [[Woman of the Apocalypse]] from the [[New Testament]]'s Revelation 12:1:  "arrayed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars." Mateo de la Cruz, writing twelve years after Sánchez, "argued that the Guadalupe possessed all the iconographical attributes of Mary in her [[Immaculate Conception]]".<ref name="brading"/> Likewise, a 1738 sermon preached by Miguel Picazo argued that the Guadalupe was the "best representation" of the Immaculate Conception.<ref name="brading"/>

[[Image:Virginmaguey2.jpg|left|thumb|275px|Virgin in a maguey.]]

Many writers, including Patricia Harrington and [[Virgil Elizondo]], describe the image as containing coded messages for the [[indigenous people of Mexico]].<ref name="elizondo"/><ref>"The Image." [http://www.interlupe.com.mx/6-e.html], accessed 3 December 2006</ref> <blockquote>"The Aztecs...had an elaborate, coherent symbolic system for making sense of their lives. When this was destroyed by the Spaniards, something new was needed to fill the void and make sense of New Spain...the image of Guadalupe served that purpose."<ref>Harrington, Patricia.  "Mother of Death, Mother of Rebirth: The Virgin of Guadalupe."  ''Journal of the American Academy of Religion.''  Vol. 56, Issue 1, p. 25-50. 1988</ref></blockquote>   Her blue-green [[mantle]] was described as the color once reserved for the divine couple [[Ometecuhtli]] and [[Omecihuatl]];<ref>"La Virgen de Guadalupe," panam.edu [http://www.panam.edu/dept/lrgvarchive/virgen.html], accessed 30 November 2006</ref> her [[belt]] is read as a sign of [[pregnancy]]; and a cross-shaped image symbolizing the cosmos and called ''[[nahui-ollin]]'' is said to be inscribed beneath the image's sash.<ref>"The Lady of Guadalupe. An Invented Myth or a Strange Reality?"  laermita.org[http://laermita.org/ladyguad.htm], accessed 30 November 2006</ref>

Yet another interpretation of the image is offered by the historian [[William B. Taylor]], who recounted that Guadalupe has also been "acclaimed goddess of the [[maguey]] <nowiki>[agave]</nowiki>" and [[pulque]] was drunk on her feast day. A [[1772]] report described the rays of light around Guadalupe as maguey spines.<ref>Taylor, William B. Drinking, Homicide, and Rebellion in Colonial Mexican Villages.

===Maravilla Americana===
{{main|Maravilla Americana}}
[[Image:MIGUELCABRERA.jpg|left|200px]]
''Maravilla Americana''<ref>Ernesto de la Torre Villar, y Ramiro Navarro de Anda. "Testimonios Históricos Guadalupanos." Fondo de Cultura Económica, 1982</ref> (American Marvel) are the first two words of the lengthy title of a literary masterpiece by Miguel Cabrera (1695-1768), “the genial brush turned to a pen” as it was immediately celebrated. Its translation to Italian gave the pen fame in Europe among artists and clergymen beyond what the brush had accomplished in the Vatican, when Pope Benedict XIV felt impelled to exclaim: “Non fecit taliter omni nationi” from Psalm 147:20—God’s done nothing like it for any other nation—in admiring Cabrera’s copy of the Guadalupan image.

Written in 1756, it is still the standard description of many wonders extant to the portrait. Cabrera and six other master painters were called by the Chapter of the Basilica in 1751 to give their professional opinion on the Guadalupan Portrait from an artistic standpoint; specifically, signalling out the materials and pictorial technique that composed it. After fulfilling this request and presenting a report, Cabrera felt inspired to extend it on his own; but as a courtesy, required a signed opinion of his work from his six colleagues, six professional statements which were also printed in both languages.

==Controversies==
[[Image:Eternal father painting guadalupe.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Eighteenth-century painting of God illustrating the Guadalupe]]
As early as [[1556]] Francisco de Bustamante, head of the Colony's [[Franciscans]], delivered a sermon before the Viceroy and members of the Royal Audience. In that sermon, disparaging the holy origins of the picture and contradicting Archbishop Montúfar's sermon of two days before,  Bustamante stated: <blockquote>"The devotion that has been growing in a chapel dedicated to Our Lady, called of Guadalupe, in this city is greatly harmful for the natives, because it makes them believe that the image painted by Marcos the Indian is in any way miraculous."<ref>"Marcos" may have referred to the Aztec painter Marcos Cipac de Aquino, who was active in Mexico when the icon appeared.</ref><ref name="poole"/></blockquote>  In those inquisitorial times the accusation leveled against Montúfar for promoting idolatry publicly could have carried one of them to the stake, besides provoking a generalized scandal demanding strong sanctions by itself. This has left several mysteries to be solved by historians: 1) incredibly, there is no known historical outcome.<ref>Ernesto de la Torre Villar, y Ramiro Navarro de Anda. "Testimonios Históricos Guadalupanos." Fondo de Cultura Económica, 1982</ref> 2) There is no historical evidence of Bustamante having ever been sanctioned by anyone. He was being proposed in Mexico for Bishop of Guatemala on May 1563; posthumously, as the news of his decease in Spain on November 1st, 1562 were still unheard of in New Spain. 3) There is contrary evidence by his contemporaries: historians such as Torquemada (not the inquisitor), and Mendieta, refer to Bustamante always encomiastically, as to a "Most Prudent Man";<ref>Cervantes Aguirre, Rafael. El Incidente Bustamante, Cuarto Encuentro Nacional Guadalupano, México D.F. 1979. p. 13-27</ref> the only compliment he could have never won by causing one of the two greatest scandals in Colonial History.<ref>Ernesto de la Torre Villar, y Ramiro Navarro de Anda.

The solution points to the Dominican Bustamante making a scandal to get the Inquisition established in New Spain—probably with Montúfar's complicity—as previous requests for it to the Spanish Crown were still unattended.<ref>De Guerrero Osio y Rivas, Luis.

In 1611 the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Martin de Leon, fourth viceroy of Mexico, denounced the cult of the Virgin of Guadalupe as a disguised worship of the Aztec goddess [[Tonantzin]].<ref name="poole"/> The missionary and anthropologist [[Bernardino de Sahagún]] held the same opinion: he wrote that the shrine at [[Tepeyac]] was extremely popular but worrisome because people called the Virgin of Guadalupe [[Tonantzin]]. Sahagún said that the worshipers claimed that [[Tonantzin]] was the proper [[Nahuatl]] for "Mother of God"—but he disagreed, saying that "Mother of God" in [[Nahuatl]] would be "Dios y Nantzin."<ref>"Fray Bernaerdino de Sagahun y el culto de Guadalupe." Proyecto Guadalupano [http://www.proyectoguadalupe.com/documentos/sahagun.html], accessed 1 December 2006</ref> This type of worries relative to confussion in Indian minds were due to missionaries feeling responsible for the souls of their flock.

In 2002, art restoration expert José Sol Rosales said he examined the icon with a [[stereomicroscope]] and that he identified [[calcium sulfate]], pine soot, white, blue, and green "tierras" (soil), reds made from [[carmine]] and other pigments, as well as [[gold]]. Rosales said he found the work consistent with 16th century materials and methods.<ref>Vera, Rodrigo. "La Guadalupana, tres imagenes en uno." ''Proceso'', May 25 2002.

[[Norberto Rivera Carrera]], Archbishop of [[Mexico]], supposedly commissioned a 1999 study to test the tilma's age. The researcher, [[Leoncio Garza-Valdés]], had previously worked with the Shroud of Turin. Upon inspection, Garza-Valdés said he found three distinct layers in the painting, at least one of which was signed and dated. He also said that the original painting showed striking similarities to the original [[Our Lady of Guadalupe (Extremadura)|Lady of Guadalupe]] found in [[Extremadura]] Spain, and that the second painting showed another Virgin with indigenous features. Finally, Garza-Valdés indicated that the fabric on which the icon is painted is made of conventional [[hemp]] and [[linen]], not [[agave]] fibers as is popularly believed.<ref>Vera, Rodrigo.  "La Guadalupana: tres imagenes en una."  ''Proceso.'' 25 May 2002. [http://www.sectas.org/Secciones_Especiales/canonizacion/guadalupana.htm], accessed 5 December 2006</ref>  The photographs of these putative overpaintings were not available in the Garza-Valdés 2002 publication, however.<ref>Peterson, Jeannette Favot. "The Virgin of Guadalupe. Symbol of Conquest or Liberation?" Art Journal. Vol. 51, Issue 4, p. 39. 1992</ref> [[Gilberto Aguirre]]. a San Antonio optometrist and colleague of Garza-Valdés who also took part in the 1999 study, examined the same photographs and stated that, while agreeing the painting had been tampered with, he disagreed with Garza-Valdes' conclusions. Gilberto Aguirre claims the conditions for conducting the study were inadequate. No control of the lighting and the fact that the painting was shot through an acrylic plate scientifically invalidates any results. He also questions Garza-Valdés' claim of ultraviolet light revealing two underlying images because according to Aguirre, ultraviolet light can't penetrate sub-surfaces. The team did take infrared pictures but those didn't show additional images underneath the present one.<ref>Ashburne, Elyse. "Catholic relic's authenticity questioned by researcher." ''Daily Texan.'' June 4, 2002.

Infrared studies available since 1946 establish a very precise picture: There is only one image, inexplicable to science<ref>Escalada, Xavier. "Enciclopedia Guadalupana" vol. III. México</ref> and now exhibited—both, positive and negative infrared—on the Internet.<ref>http://g-infrared.blogspot.com/</ref>

Silhouettes bearing any similarity to the outline of the Virgin are lovingly detected by the devout and reported in many cities and towns throughout [[Mexico]]; in the Mexican town of [[Tlaltenango]] in the state of Morelos, a painting of Our Lady of Guadalupe is claimed to have miraculously appeared in the inside of a box that two unknown travelers left in a hostel. The owners of the hostel called the local priest after noticing enticing aromas of flowers and [[sandalwood]] coming out of the box. The image has been venerated on September 8 since its finding in 1720, and is accepted as a valid apparition of an image by the local Catholic authorities.<ref>Garduño, Thalia Ehrlich. "Virgen de Tlaltenango."  [http://www.mariologia.org/advocacionesmexico01.htm], accessed 29 November 2006.</ref>

At least 300 figures bearing a resemblance to the Virgin are found and reported in Mexico every year according to the press, many on burned toast and [[tortilla]]s. In one of the most recent cases, believers reported a semblance of the Virgin of Guadalupe in a humidity stain in the [[Mexico City]] [[metro]]. This apparition of an image (different from the personal apparitions of December 9 to 12 of 1531) was called the "Virgin of the Subway."<ref>Monsivais, Carlos. "Estampas al borde de la piedad."

=== Alleged miraculous properties===
Some consider it miraculous that the [[Tilmàtli|tilma]] maintains its structural integrity after nearly 500 years, since replicas made with the same type of materials lasted only about 15 years before disintegrating.<ref name="giulio">Guerra, Giulio Dante.  "La Madonna di Guadalupe. 'Inculturazione' Miracolosa." Christianita. n. 205-206, 1992.  [http://www.alleanzacattolica.org/indici/articoli/guerragd205_206.htm], accessed 1 December 2006</ref> In addition to withstanding the elements, the tilma resisted a 1791 ammonia spill that made a considerable hole, which was reportedly repaired in two weeks with no external help. In 1921, an anarchist placed an offering of flowers next to the image. A bomb hidden within the flowers exploded and destroyed the shrine. However, the image suffered no damage.<ref>"Our Lady of Guadalupe" livingmiracles.net [http://www.livingmiracles.net/Guadalupe.html], accessed 30 November 2006</ref><ref>"Our Lady of Guadalupe"  catholic.org [http://www.catholic.org/about/guadalupe.php], accessed 30 November 2006</ref>

[[Image:eyedetl.jpg|right|frame|Image somewhat resembling a bearded man found in the Virgin's eye.]]

Photographers and [[ophthalmology|ophthalmologists]] have reported images reflected in the eyes of the Virgin.<ref>"The Eyes." Interlupe. [http://www.interlupe.com.mx/8-e.html], accessed 3 December</ref><ref>"Los Ojos de Guadalupe: Un misterio para la ciencia." fluvium.org, accessed 30 November 2006 [http://www.fluvium.org/textos/lectura/lectura67.htm]</ref> In 1929 and 1951 photographers found a figure reflected in the Virgin's eyes; upon inspection they said that the reflection was tripled in what is called the [[Purkinje images|Purkinje effect]]. This effect is commonly found in human eyes.<ref name="giulio"/> The ophthalmologist Dr. Jose Aston Tonsmann later enlarged the image of the Virgin's eyes by 2500x [[magnification]] and said he saw not only the aforementioned single figure, but rather images of all the witnesses present when the [[Tilmàtli|tilma]] was shown to the [[Bishop]] in 1531. Tonsmann also reported seeing a small family—mother, father, and a group of children—in the center of the Virgin's eyes.<ref name="giulio"/>

In response to the eye miracles, Joe Nickell and John F. Fischer wrote in ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]''  that images seen in the Virgin's eyes could be the result of the human tendency to form familiar shapes from random patterns, much like a psychologist's [[Rorschach inkblot test|inkblots]]—a phenomenon known as [[religious pareidolia]].<ref>Nickell, Joe. "'Miraculous' Image of Guadalupe." Skeptical Briefs, June 2002. [http://www.csicop.org/sb/2002-06/guadalupe.html] accessed 29 November 2006.</ref>

[[Richard Kuhn]], who received the 1938 [[Nobel Prize in chemistry|Nobel Chemistry prize]], is said to have analyzed a sample of the fabric in 1936 and said the tint on the fabric was not from a known mineral, vegetable, or animal source.<ref name="giulio"/>

In 1979 Philip Serna Callahan studied the icon with [[infrared]] light and stated that portions of the face, hands, robe, and mantle had been painted in one step, with no sketches or corrections and no paintbrush strokes.<ref>Sennott, Br. Thomas Mary.  "The Tilma of Guadalupe: A Scientific Analysis." [http://motherofallpeoples.com/index2.php?option=com_content&do_pdf=1&id=163] </ref>

==Guadalupe in the Catholic Church==
===Pontifical Pronouncements on the Virgin of Guadalupe===
[[Image:Maryqueenoftheuniverseshrinemaryofguadalupe.JPG|right|thumb|A [[mosaic]] of Our Lady of Guadalupe at the [[Mary, Queen of the Universe Shrine]] in [[Florida]].]]
With the Brief ''Non est equidem'' of [[May 25]] [[1754]], [[Pope Benedict XIV]] declared Our Lady of Guadalupe patron of what was then called New Spain, corresponding to Spanish Central and Northern America, and approved liturgical texts for the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and [[Liturgy of the Hours]] in her honour.  [[Pope Leo XIII]] granted new texts in 1891 and authorized coronation of the image in 1895. [[Pope Pius X|Pope Saint Pius X]] proclaimed her patron of Latin America in 1910. In 1935 [[Pope Pius XI]] proclaimed her patron of the Philippines and had a monument in her honor erected in the Vatican Gardens. [[Pope Pius XII]] declared the Virgin of Guadalupe “Queen of Mexico and Empress of the Americas” in 1945, and "Patroness of the Americas" in 1946. [[Pope John XXIII]] invoked her as "Mother of the Americas" in 1961, referring to her as Mother and Teacher of the Faith of All American populations, and in 1966 [[Pope Paul VI]] sent a [[Golden Rose]] to the shrine.<ref name="popes">Notitiae, bulletin of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, 2002, pages 194-195</ref>

[[Pope John Paul II]] visited the shrine in the course of his first journey outside Italy as Pope from 26 to [[January 31]] [[1979]], and again when he beatified Juan Diego there on [[6 May]] [[1990]]. In 1992 he dedicated to Our Lady of Guadalupe a chapel within [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in the Vatican. At the request of the Special Assembly for the Americas of the Synod of Bishops, he named Our Lady of Guadalupe patron of the Americas on [[January 22]] [[1999]] (with the result that her liturgical celebration had, throughout the Americas, the rank of Solemnity), and visited the shrine again on the following day. On [[July 31]] [[2002]], he canonized Juan Diego before a crowd of 12 million, and later that year included in the [[Roman Catholic calendar of saints|General Calendar]] of the [[Roman Rite]], as optional memorials, the liturgical celebrations of Saint Juan Diego Cuauhtlatoatzin ([[December 9]]) and Our Lady of Guadalupe ([[12 December]]).<ref name="popes"/>

===Catholic devotions===

Replicas of the tilma can be found in thousands of churches throughout the world, including [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] Cathedral in [[Paris]] and the [[Basilica of Saint Peter]] in [[Rome]], and numerous [[parish]]es bear her name.
