'''George Mason Lovering''' ([[January 10]], [[1832]] &ndash; [[April 2]], [[1919]]) was a [[Union Army]] soldier who received the [[Medal of Honor]] for meritorious service during the [[American Civil War]].

==Biography==
He was born to James and Catherine Lovering on [[January 10]], [[1832]], in [[Springfield, New Hampshire]]. The family soon moved to East Randolph (now [[Holbrook, Massachusetts]]), and George eventually joined the Randolph Light Infantry, a [[militia]] unit that was called into active service at the start of the Civil War. He served as [[First Sergeant]] in Company I of the 4th Massachusetts Infantry. On [[June 14]], [[1863]], Lovering took part in the [[Siege of Port Hudson]], a Confederate stronghold on the [[Mississippi River]]. His courage in this battle resulted in Lovering being awarded a Medal of Honor in [[1891]], the only such recipient from Holbrook.

Lovering was commissioned as a [[First Lieutenant]] in the renamed 75th Regiment of [[U.S. Colored Troops]], which was formed from the 3rd Infantry Corps d'Afrique. He participated in the [[Red River Campaign]], then served in the [[bayou]]s of [[Louisiana]] until he was mustered out in [[1865]]. 

He eventually moved to [[Maine]], spending his final years living at a veterans home. He died at the age of 87 at St. Mary's Hospital in [[Lewiston, Maine]]. He is buried in Union Cemetery in Holbrook.

==Medal of Honor==
Rank and organization: First Sergeant, Company I, 4th Massachusetts Infantry. Place and date: At Port Hudson, La., 14 June 1863. Entered service at: East Randolph, Mass. Born: 10 January 1832, Springfield, N.H. Date of issue: 19 November 1891.
