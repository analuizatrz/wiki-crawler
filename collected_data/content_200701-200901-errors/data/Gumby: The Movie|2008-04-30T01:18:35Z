==Quotes==
Goo [to Lucky Claybert]: I found a robot that made soup!

[After Pokey, Prickle, and Goo got fused together into a multi-character clay ball]

Pokey: I won't believe it. It can't be true!

Prickle: "To believe or not to believe?" That is the question.

Goo: You'd better start believing it 'cause I'm uncomfortable! Now everybody pull themselves together... I... I mean "apart".

Prickle: Impossible, Goo. Somebody call an ambulance.

Pokey: I wish Gumby would tell somebody where he goes. 

Prickle: Oh, well, Goo, here we come! 

Astronut #1: Maybe Gumby and Pokey went to the earth and into the toy shop?

Astronut #2: I don't know. Sometimes that wants to do that thing. Look!

Pokey: Gumby might think it was the same fat!

[Pokey lands on the Gumbasia Clay Set and Gumby as a green monolith flies to another location]
Pokey: Nuts, I thought he wanted to land here.  

Pokey (repeated line) : Holy Toledo!

Professor Kapp: Oh, my! This music does things to my brain!

Prickle: It does things to my spine.

Goo: It makes me feel funny all over!
