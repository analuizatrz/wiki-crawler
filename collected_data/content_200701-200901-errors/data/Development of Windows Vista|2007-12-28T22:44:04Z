}}</ref> prior to the release of [[Microsoft]]'s [[Windows XP]] operating system, and continuing until November 2006.

Microsoft originally expected to ship the new version sometime late in 2003 as a minor step between Windows XP and "Blackcomb".{{fact|date=December 2007}} Vista's original [[List of Microsoft software codenames|codename]], "Longhorn", was an allusion to this plan: While Whistler and Blackcomb are large ski resorts in [[British Columbia]], Longhorn is the name of a bar between the two mountains that Whistler's visitors pass to reach Blackcomb. Gradually, "Longhorn" assimilated many of the important new features and technologies slated for "Blackcomb", resulting in the release date being pushed back a few times. Many of Microsoft's developers were also re-tasked with improving the security of Windows XP. Faced with ongoing delays and concerns about [[Creeping featurism|feature creep]], Microsoft announced on [[August 27]] [[2004]] that it was making significant changes. "Longhorn" development basically started afresh, building on the [[Windows Server 2003]] codebase, and re-incorporating only the features that would be intended for an actual operating system release. Some previously announced features, such as [[WinFS]] and [[Next-Generation Secure Computing Base|NGSCB]], were dropped or postponed.

After "Longhorn" was named Windows Vista in mid-2005, an unprecedented [[Development stage|beta-test]] program was started which involved hundreds of thousands of volunteers and companies. Between September 2005 and October 2006, Microsoft released regular [[CTP|Community Technology Previews]] (CTP) to beta testers, and two release candidates to the general public. Development of Windows Vista came to a conclusion with the [[November 8]] [[2006]] announcement of its completion by co-president of Windows development, [[Jim Allchin]].

==2002: Early development==
The early development stages of Longhorn were generally characterized by incremental improvements and updates to Windows XP. During this period, Microsoft was fairly quiet about what was being worked on, as their marketing and public relations focus was more strongly focused on Windows XP, and [[Windows Server 2003]], which was released in April of 2003. Occasional builds of Longhorn were leaked onto popular [[file sharing]] networks such as [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]], [[BitTorrent]], [[eDonkey network|eDonkey]] and various [[newsgroup]]s, and so most of what is known about builds prior to the first sanctioned development release of Longhorn in May 2003, is derived from these builds.

Most builds of Longhorn and Vista were identified by a label that was always displayed in the bottom-right corner of the desktop. A typical build label would look like "Build 3683.Lab06_N.020923-1821". Higher build numbers didn't automatically mean that the latest features from every development team at Microsoft was included. Typically, a team working on a certain feature or subsystem would generate their own working builds which developers would test with, and when the code was deemed stable, all the changes would be incorporated back into the main development tree at once. At Microsoft, a number of "Build labs" exist where the compilation of the entirety of Windows can be performed by a team. The lab in which any given build originated is shown as part of the build label, and the date and time of the build follows that. Some builds (such as Beta 1 and Beta 2) only display the build label in the version information dialog (Winver).

===Milestone 2===
'''Build 3663''' (build date of [[July 28]] [[2002]]) was the first known build with some leaked screenshots. It was the first sighting of the "Plex" style which Microsoft regarded as a place-holder theme for their development versions, until they were ready to demonstrate [[Aero (user interface)|Aero]]. Screenshots of '''Build 3670''' (build date of [[August 19]] [[2002]]) also showed a variation of the Device Manager implemented inside Windows Explorer.

===Milestone 3===
[[Image:Windows Longhorn Build 3683.png|thumb|"Longhorn XP Professional", Build 3683]]
'''Build 3683''' (build date of [[September 23]] [[2002]]) was leaked on [[October 20]] [[2002]], and was the first Longhorn build leaked to the Internet. This build was the first of several that had a working title of "'''Longhorn XP Professional'''". Visually it was not significantly different from Windows XP, incorporating aesthetic changes and a few new user interface options. A new "Sidebar" was also present, which contained many of the gadgets that would much later be seen in [[Windows Sidebar]], such as an analog clock, slide show, and search capability. An option in this version of the sidebar also made it possible to move the Start button into it, and disable the traditional taskbar entirely. An early revision of [[WinFS]] was also included, but very little in the way of a user interface was included, and as such it appeared to early testers to be nothing more than a service that consumed large amounts of memory and processor time. The "Display Properties" control panel<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.winsupersite.com/images/reviews/lh_alpha_029.gif|title=Display Properties|accessdate=2007-09-08}}</ref> was the first significant departure, being built on the new "[[Windows Presentation Foundation|Avalon]]" [[application programming interface|API]].<ref name="build3683">{{cite web

'''Build 3706''' (build date of [[October 29]] [[2002]]) was leaked on [[May 22]] [[2004]]. It was one of the first builds to contain some Desktop Composition Engine (DCE) and Desktop Windows Manager ([[Desktop Window Manager|DWM]]) features.

'''Build 3718''' (build date of [[November 19]] [[2002]]) was leaked on [[April 30]] [[2004]]. It included the DWM and some early hardware-accelerated [[Aero (user interface)|Aero]] effects, such as alpha transparency and transitions. As a demonstration of the DCE's capabilities, programs literally flipped into the taskbar and twisted as they were minimized.

==2003 and early 2004: New technology==
===Milestone 4===
[[Image:Windows Longhorn Build 4008.png|thumb|"Windows XP Longhorn", Build 4008]]
After several months of relatively little news or activity from Microsoft with Longhorn, '''Build 4008''' (with a build date of [[February 19]] [[2003]]) made an appearance on the Internet around [[February 28]] [[2003]].<ref name="build4008">{{cite web

| publisher=Windows SuperSite
}}</ref> It was also privately handed out to a select group of software developers. As an evolutionary release over build 3683, it contained a number of small improvements, including a modified blue "Plex" theme and a new, simplified Windows Image-based installer that operates in graphical mode from the outset, and completed an install of the operating system in approximately one third the time of Windows XP on the same hardware. An optional "new taskbar" was introduced that was thinner than the previous build and displayed the time differently.

The most notable visual and functional difference, however, came with [[Windows Explorer]]. The incorporation of the Plex theme made blue the dominant color of the entire application. The Windows XP-style task pane was almost completely replaced with a large horizontal pane that appeared under the toolbars. A new search interface allowed for filtering of results, searching of Windows help, and natural-language queries that would be used to integrate with WinFS. The animated search characters were also removed. The "view modes" were also replaced with a single slider that would resize the icons in real-time, in list, thumbnail, or details mode, depending on where the slider was. File metadata was also made more visible and more easily editable, with more active encouragement to fill out missing pieces of information. Also of note was the conversion of Windows Explorer to being a [[.NET Framework|.NET]] application.

===Milestone 5===
'''Build 4015''' (build date of [[March 28]] [[2003]]) was leaked to the Internet on [[April 28]] [[2003]]. A number of features Microsoft had been working on were rolled into this build, such as a range of parental controls, a lot of additional configurability for the sidebar (including being able to put it below the start bar at the bottom of the screen), and the notion of "Libraries" (later known as virtual folders) of files. These libraries collected content from around the hard drive. The user could then filter this content and save it in a folder. Microsoft had originally intended to replace all special shell folders (My Documents, My Music, etc.) with virtual folders. However, this change was deemed too drastic and was dropped after Beta 1's release in mid-2005. This build was also notable for the debut of the boot screen progress bar that is seen in the final release (though 4015's version was blue, not green). A new Download Manager shell location suggested that the OS (and Internet Explorer 7) would get a [[Mozilla]]-style download manager. This feature was also dropped. Significant [[memory leak]] problems with Windows Explorer and the Sidebar made this build difficult to use, which resulted in some third-party hacks to mitigate the problem. The back-end database of Outlook Express changed completely, and became dependent on WinFS to store its email. WinFS itself still had significant performance and memory usage issues, and so it became common for testers to disable WinFS entirely, thus rendering Outlook Express inoperative.

At the [[Windows Hardware Engineering Conference]] (WinHEC) conference in May 2003, Microsoft gave their first public demonstrations of the new Desktop Window Manager and Aero. The demonstrations were done on a revised build 4015 which was never released. A number of sessions for developers and hardware engineers at the conference focused on these new features, as well as the [[Next Generation Secure Computing Base]] (previously known as "Palladium"), which at the time was Microsoft's proposed solution for creating a secure computing environment whereby any given component of the system could be deemed "trusted". Also at this conference, Microsoft reiterated their roadmap for delivering Longhorn, pointing to an "early 2005" release date.<ref name="winhec2003">{{cite web

[[Image:Windows Longhorn Build 4029.png|thumb|Windows Explorer in Windows "onghornLay rofessionalPay"<!--Do not remove the Pig Latin (see the rest of this section).-->, Build 4029]]
'''Build 4028''' (build date of [[July 1]] [[2003]]) was the first known Server build, and was based on Windows Server.NET RC1, which later became Windows Server 2003. Traditional client bits, such as visual style and look, were present but disabled by default.
'''Build 4029''' (build date of [[June 19]] [[2003]]), was leaked on [[September 23]] [[2003]]. This build contained few of the technologies new to build 4015. Windows Explorer went through a number of other changes. Larger image and video previews were displayed in a tooltip when the mouse hovered over a file, column-level filtering of results was introduced, and overall performance of Explorer was somewhat improved over build 4015, though the memory leak issues were not entirely resolved. There was also a new analog clock user interface. Batch image processing of images was also introduced, making it possible for a user to rotate a number of images at once.

Build 4029's name was displayed as "'''onghornLay rofessionalPay'''" ([[Pig Latin]] for Longhorn Professional) in various places around the operating system. While some had presumed that screenshots of this build were fake because of this seemingly obvious mistake, Microsoft later explained that this was merely a test of some new code to locate and reduce the number of places in the operating system code that the name was defined.<ref name="build4029name">{{cite web

===Milestone 6===
'''Build 4033''' (build date of [[July 17]] [[2003]]) was similar to 4029, but contained some UI improvements, including an updated Plex theme.

'''Build 4039''' (build date of [[August 27]], [[2003]]) was leaked on [[August 22]] [[2007]]. This build includes Phodeo, a 3D view of displaying photos and full DWM and glass.

[[Image:Longhorn 4051.jpg|thumb|"Windows Codename Longhorn", Build 4051 (Official PDC 2003 build)]]

'''Official PDC 2003 build''' (build date of [[October 1]], [[2003]] with a build number of '''4051''') was not released to the general public, but it did leak on [[October 20]], [[2003]]. It introduced a new Slate theme. Some visual changes included:
* Added the '''Documents''' folder, for sharing documents with other users.
* Added the '''Photos and Videos''' folder, for sharing pictures and videos with other users.
* '''My Contacts''' was replaced by '''Contacts'''.
* '''My Computer''' was replaced by '''Computer'''.
* '''My Network Places''' was replaced by '''Network Places'''.

'''Build 4053''' (build date of [[October 22]], [[2003]]) was leaked on [[March 2]] [[2004]] and had some minor changes.

===Milestone 7===
[[Image:Windows Longhorn build 4074 screenshot.png|thumb|"Windows Codename Longhorn", Build 4074]]
'''Build 4074''' (build date of [[April 25]] [[2004]]) - '''Official WinHEC 2004 preview build.''' Leaked in May 2004. This build introduced a new Jade theme, and replaced many XP icons with new Longhorn icons. Also, the font [[Segoe UI]] was introduced for the Jade theme.

In May 2004, Microsoft changed its plans to include the [[Next-Generation Secure Computing Base]] technology with Longhorn. The technology, better known by its original code-name of "Palladium", had garnered much criticism from analysts, security specialists and researchers, and was often cited by advocates of non-[[Microsoft]] operating systems as a reason to migrate to their preferred platform. [[Ross Anderson]], for example, published a paper, collating many of these concerns and criticisms as part of a larger analysis on [[Trusted Computing]].<ref>{{cite web

'''Build 4083''' (build date of [[May 16]] [[2004]]) - Leaked on [[November 10]] [[2004]], and was the last leaked 64-bit Server 2003 RC1-based build. Both Sidebar and WinFS were dropped from this release. Considered highly unstable, including the absence of programs in the start menu and driver and installation issues.

'''Build 4093''' (build date of [[August 19]] [[2004]]) - The last leaked 32-bit Server 2003 RC1-based build. Considered highly unstable. Contained Sidebar, WinFS, and an [[Windows Presentation Foundation|Avalon]]-based [[Windows Movie Maker]].

==Mid-2004 to Mid-2005: Development "reset"==
By the end of 2003, it had become obvious to the Windows team at Microsoft that they were losing sight of what needed to be done to complete the next version of Windows and ship it to customers. Internally, some Microsoft employees were describing the Longhorn project as "another Cairo" or "Cairo.NET", referring to the [[Cairo (operating system)|Cairo development project]] that the company embarked on through the first half of the 1990s, which never resulted in a shipping operating system (though nearly all the technologies developed in that time did end up in [[Windows 95]] and [[Windows NT]].<ref name="caplancairo">{{cite web

</ref> Microsoft co-president [[James Allchin|Jim Allchin]], who had overall responsibility for the development and delivery of Windows, explained how development of Longhorn was "crashing into the ground" due in large part to the haphazard methods by which features were introduced and integrated into the core of the operating system, without a clear focus on an end-product. In December 2003, Allchin enlisted the help of two other senior executives, Brian Valentine and Amitabh Srivastava, the former being experienced with shipping software at Microsoft, most notably Windows Server 2003,<ref name="supersitevalentine">{{cite web

}}</ref> These things, in conjunction with the fact that many of Microsoft's most skilled developers and engineers had been working on Windows Server 2003, led to the decision to "reset" development of Longhorn, building on the same code that would become Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1, instead of the older Windows XP. This change, announced internally to Microsoft employees on [[August 26]] [[2004]], began in earnest in September, though it would take several more months before the new development process and build methodology would be used by all of the development teams. A number of complaints came from individual developers, and Bill Gates himself, that the new development process was going to be prohibitively difficult to work within. Changes at the build labs also resulted in a period of time of several months where no builds of Longhorn were leaked onto the Internet.

===Longhorn "D1"===
'''Build 3790''' (build date of [[September 7]] [[2004]]) is notable, as it was the first build of Longhorn based on the Server 2003 codebase, but with the Windows XP interface. Successive internal builds over several months gradually integrated a lot of the fundamental work that had been done over the previous three years, but with much stricter rules about what code could be brought into the main builds. Builds in this period of time were described variously as Longhorn "D1", and as Milestone 8 / 9, depending on whether the new or old build tree was being worked on. Evidence of a similar build marked as Build 5000 (built one day later) has also been found.<ref>{{cite web

[[Image:Windows Longhorn Build 5048.jpg|thumb|"Windows Codename Longhorn", Build 5048]]
'''Build 5048''' (built on [[April 1]] [[2005]]) was the official WinHEC 2005 preview build, described as the '''Longhorn Developer Preview''', and made available to WinHEC attendees on [[April 24]] [[2005]]. It was the only build from this time period that was made available by Microsoft; it was not officially distributed outside of WinHEC, but the build quickly appeared on file sharing networks. The Aero visual style made its first appearance in this build, and the Desktop Window Manager was present but disabled and hidden by default. At the keynote presentation, Bill Gates also announced that many of the WinFX developer APIs that were originally planned exclusively for Longhorn were going to be backported to Windows XP and Server 2003, and that the final user interface for Longhorn would not be seen for a while longer. Other features such as device-independent resolutions, rasterized icons, virtual folders, and registry virtualization were discussed as well.

Build 5048's closer resemblance to Windows XP than to the prior Longhorn builds from 2003 surprised many, leading well-known Windows enthusiast [[Paul Thurrott]] to write: "My thoughts are not positive, not positive at all. This is a painful build to have to deal with after a year of waiting, a step back in some ways. I hope Microsoft has surprises up their sleeves. This has the makings of a train wreck."<ref name="thurrott5048">{{cite web

==Mid-2005 to November 2006: Windows Vista==
By the beginning of [[July]] [[2005]], having painted itself into a corner, so to speak, by choosing names like Windows Me and XP for previous client releases of Windows, Microsoft now had to find an even more interesting name for "Longhorn", to avoid the perception that this was a boring release (supposing that Windows 2006 would sound less exciting than Windows XP). The company considered several names from simple numbers such as "Windows Seven" or "Windows 7", or letters (like XP), to other more fanciful, inventive names. In the end, Microsoft chose ''Windows Vista'', believing it to be a "wonderful intersection of what the product really does, what Windows stands for, and what resonates with customers, and their needs." Group Project Manager Greg Sullivan told Paul Thurrott — "You want the PC to adapt to you and help you cut through the clutter to focus on what’s important to you. That's what Windows Vista is all about: ''"bringing clarity to your world."'' (a reference to the three marketing points of Vista — Clear, Connected, Confident), so you can focus on what matters to you." Microsoft co-president Jim Allchin also loved the name, saying that '''"Vista"''' creates the right imagery for the new product capabilities and inspires the imagination with all the possibilities of what can be done with Windows -- making people’s passions come alive."<ref name="roadtogold4">{{cite web

===Beta 1===
[[Image:Windows Vista Beta 1 Desktop.png|thumb|Screenshot of Windows Vista Beta 1 (Build 5112)]]
'''Windows Vista Beta 1''' (build 5112, build date of [[July 20]], [[2005]]) was released on [[July 27]] [[2005]], and was available to [[Microsoft Developer Network]] (MSDN) and TechNet subscribers as well as a select group of Microsoft Beta testers.

Compared with the WinHEC build released earlier in the year, Vista Beta 1 was a large advancement in introducing new user interface features. The Windows Shell was drastically changed yet again, introducing virtual folders, a new search interface, a number of new high-resolution icons, and a revamped Windows Explorer interface which did away with the menus and most of the toolbar buttons that were present in previous versions. Beta 1 also introduced many of the underlying technologies slated for Vista, including the new networking and audio stacks, parental controls, and fairly complete working build of [[.NET Framework 3.0]], then still referred to as ''WinFX''.

===Community Technology Previews===
'''Build 5219''' (build date of [[August 30]] [[2005]]), Microsoft started releasing regular Community Technical Previews (CTP) to beta testers, with less stability work made to them than actual betas.
Build 5219, also known as '''CTP1''' and '''September CTP''', was distributed among 2005 PDC attendees on [[September 13]] [[2005]], and has been released to Microsoft Beta testers and MSDN subscribers. This was the first public "Ultimate Edition" build, and included Smart Fetch. Although not enabled by default, this refresh saw the return of the [[Windows Sidebar]], which had been removed as part of the development reset, and the introduction of [[Desktop Gadgets]], both of which are part of [[Microsoft gadgets]] line of mini-applications, which are similar to [[Yahoo Widget Engine]]'s widgets. Microsoft has stated that these Gadgets will be available for download at [http://www.microsoftgadgets.com/ Microsoft Gadgets website]. This build also supported a new version of Windows Media Center code-named "Diamond" (previously available only in [[Windows XP Media Center Edition]]).
Although Microsoft has stated that WinFS will not make its wide-reaching debut in Windows Vista, users of the 5219 build noticed that WinFS was in fact included in that version. Several Windows 'rumor' sites and newsgroups such as Neowin and Paul Thurrott's [http://www.winsupersite.com/ SuperSite for Windows] speculated that WinFS would in fact be ready on time for Windows Vista's release, but this turned out not to be the case when Microsoft cancelled WinFS in June of 2006.

'''Build 5231''' (build date of [[October 4]] [[2005]]), also known as '''CTP2''' or the '''October 2005 CTP''', was released to MSDN subscribers and Microsoft Beta Testers on [[October 17]] [[2005]]. This "Ultimate" build had more stability than the previous leaked build and introduced [[Windows Media Player]] version 11.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/newsroom/winxp/WinVistaCTPFS.mspx|title=Microsoft Windows Vista October Community Technology Preview Fact Sheet|month=October|year=2005|accessdate=2007-09-08}}</ref>Paul Thurrot stated that he hated Windows Media Center in this build.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.winsupersite.com/reviews/winvista_5231.asp|title=Microsoft Windows Vista Build 5231 (Community Technical Preview 2) Review|last=Thurrott|first=Paul|accessdate=2007-09-08}}</ref>

[[Image:Windows_Vista_5259_desktop.png|thumb|Screenshot of Windows Vista Build 5259]]
'''Windows Vista TAP Preview''' (built on [[November 17]] [[2005]] with a build number of '''5259''') was released to TAP members, four days after its originally announced release date of November 18 as a November CTP. Microsoft cancelled the November CTP due to its instability, and decided to release it only to TAP members. Sidebar was temporarily removed; the build had a few new UI changes, including the ability to change the color and clarity of the UI. Windows AntiSpyware (soon to be "Windows Defender") was integrated. Also, this build featured an updated version of Windows Mail. It was an IDW build and therefore had not gone through the CTP testing process. It leaked to the Internet on [[December 7]] [[2005]].

'''December CTP''' (built on [[December 14]] [[2005]] with a build number of '''5270'''), was released to testers and MSDN on [[December 19]] [[2005]] and was very close to feature-complete. Since then, the feature complete build was delayed until late January, 2006.<ref>http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/newsroom/winxp/12-19WinVistaDecCTPFS.mspx</ref> In this build, Windows AntiSpyware was renamed Windows Defender, and IE7 had a new icon/logo. There were some minor UI changes.

'''February CTP''' (built on [[February 17]] [[2006]] with a build number of '''5308'''), was released on [[February 22]] [[2006]] and was the first feature-complete CTP. This build was meant for enterprises. It was also the first build to have the [[upgrade]] compatibility. This build, according to Microsoft, had all but one feature (which should appear in the next CTP) that customers will see in the final release. However, later builds brought more improvements than previously expected. An unstaged revision was made to this build and was released on [[February 28]] [[2006]] as build 5308.60 (built on [[February 23]]), which was released as a result of Windows Server "Longhorn" having many issues.

At the [[Intel Developer Forum]] on [[March 9]] [[2006]], Microsoft announced a change in their plans to support EFI in Windows Vista. The [[UEFI]] 2.0 specification (which replaces EFI 1.10) was not completed until early 2006, and at the time of Microsoft's announcement, no firmware manufacturers had completed a production implementation which could be used for testing. As a result, the decision was made to postpone the introduction of UEFI support to Windows; instead, support UEFI on 64-bit platforms was postponed until Vista Service Pack 1 and [[Windows Server 2008]]. 32-bit UEFI will not be supported, as Microsoft does not expect many such systems to be built as the market moves to 64-bit processors.<ref name="uefiremoved">{{cite news

'''February CTP Refresh''' (built on [[March 21]] [[2006]] with a build number of '''5342''') was released [[March 24]] [[2006]]. This build was shipped to technical beta testers and some corporate customers by Microsoft and was being used as a testing board for the extensive feedback they got from the February CTP. They described this release as an "External Developer Workstation", with the intent of providing an interim build between CTPs. Microsoft claimed it was still on track to deliver the next CTP in the second quarter, the build that will be the last in the Beta 2 fork. The build included minor UI changes, most notably improvements to the Media Center, new Aero and Aurora effects, a faster setup process, some new Sidebar gadgets, and slight improvements in overall performance and stability. Paint was also slightly improved, there's a new screenshot snapping/saving tool included, and a slightly redesigned Network Center. This build did not meet CTP quality measurements, and was available only in Ultimate Edition, for both 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) systems.

'''April EDW''' (built on [[April 19]] [[2006]] with a build number of '''5365'''), which was released on [[April 21]] [[2006]], introduced more changes to visual user interface elements, and to the behavior of User Account Control. A number of new backgrounds were also introduced, and two new screensavers were added as well. The Sidebar was enabled by default, as was automatic defragmentation of the hard drive. [[Hold'em]], a game that shipped with some previous CTPs, was dropped due to apparent "political sensitivity" issues; Microsoft is planning on offering it as a separate web download after Vista's release (it became part of Ultimate Extras, only available for the Ultimate Edition).<ref name="build5365">{{cite web

'''Windows Vista Beta 2 Preview''' (built on [[May 1]] [[2006]] with a build number of '''5381''') leaked on [[May 3]] [[2006]] and was officially released on [[May 6]], [[2006]] to Microsoft's technical beta testers. It featured mostly performance tweaks and only a few minor changes compared to build 5365. With this build, Microsoft entered Beta 2 "escrow".

===Beta 2===
[[Image:Vista Beta 2 Desktop.png|thumb|Screenshot of Windows Vista Beta 2 (Build 5384)]]
'''Windows Vista Beta 2''' (built on [[May 18]] [[2006]] with a build number of '''5384'''), was released to Microsoft Developer Network subscribers (the first since 5308) and Microsoft Connect testers on [[May 23]] [[2006]] in conjunction with Bill Gates's keynote presentation at the WinHEC 2006 conference. On [[June 6]], Microsoft extended the availability of Beta 2 to all users, making Vista available as a free download in several languages from their web site. Some technology web sites described this release as "the largest download event in software history".<ref>{{cite web

In June, Microsoft made two significant changes to their plans for Windows Vista. One issue, the inclusion of [[XML Paper Specification]] support in Vista and [[Microsoft Office 2007]], had become a major point of dispute with [[Adobe Systems]]. When it was first introduced May 2005, XPS (known at the time as "Metro") was characterized as a "PDF-killer", but an Adobe representative stated that they were "not threatened" by its addition to "Longhorn".<ref>{{cite news

While Microsoft refused to remove XPS altogether, noting that it is at the core of Vista's print [[spooling]] system, they have offered the ability to system builders and OEMs to remove any user-visible aspects of the document format from the operating system.<ref>{{cite web

On [[June 14]] [[2006]], Windows developer Philip Su posted a blog entry which decried the development process of Windows Vista, stating that "the code is way too complicated, and that the pace of coding has been tremendously slowed down by overbearing process. "<ref>{{cite web

===Pre-RC1===
'''Build 5456''' (build date of [[June 20]] [[2006]]) was released on [[June 24]], [[2006]]. Some of the new features included a revamped Aero subsystem, and a completely overhauled and significantly less obtrusive User Account Control interface. "List view" in Windows Explorer was brought back, after having been removed in Beta 1. Microsoft developer Ben Betz later explained in a blog entry that, while they felt that removing List mode made sense based on usability research and its inability to support Windows Explorer's new "grouping" feature, the feature was restored based on a great deal of feedback from beta testers.<ref name="benbetz">{{cite web

The release notes for the build state that the Time Zone bug that plagued almost all previous builds of Windows Vista had been patched, and quite a few issues in the Regional Settings and IME had also been resolved. A new "Windows Aero" mouse pointer scheme was introduced, which introduced [[anti-aliasing]] to the mouse pointer for the first time, and many of the remaining Windows XP-style icons have been replaced with new icons. The disk space used by a clean installation was also significantly reduced.

The Network Center was significantly revised as well, collating more status information in one place, and reducing the number of steps to get to most configuration options. More desktop backgrounds and icons were introduced, and Flip3D saw some layout tweaks. A new "Windows Aero" mouse cursor is set by default. The build was a huge performance improvement over Beta 2 and was comparable to and possibly even faster than that of [[Windows XP]].<ref>http://bink.nu/Article7770.bink</ref><ref>http://bink.nu/Article7771.bink</ref>

During a demonstration of the speech recognition feature new to Windows Vista at Microsoft's Financial Analyst Meeting on [[July 27]] [[2006]], the software recognized the phrase "Dear mom" as ''"Dear aunt"''.

'''Release Candidate 1 (RC1)''' (built on August 29, 2006 with a build number of '''5600.16384''') was released to a select group of beta testers on [[September 1]], [[2006]].<ref>{{cite news | first=Nick | last=White | url=http://blogs.technet.com/windowsvista/archive/2006/09/01/453491.aspx | title=It's Official: Windows Vista RC1 Is Complete | publisher=Windows Vista team blog | date=[[2006-09-01]] | accessdate=2006-09-01 }}</ref> On September 6, RC1 was released to MSDN and Technet subscribers, as well as registered Customer Preview Program (CPP) members with Beta 2 PID's. On September 14, Microsoft re-opened the CPP to new members. The CPP ended on [[November 26]] [[2006]].

The public release of Release Candidate 1 resulted in a number of extensive reviews and analyses on various technology news web sites, both immediately after its release, and in the weeks following. Ars Technica's Ken Fisher wrote that performance had improved significantly over Beta 2, suggesting that faster machines may perform better than Windows XP; he also criticised the usefulness of the [[Windows Sidebar]] and the continued intrusiveness of User Account Control.<ref>{{cite news

===Pre-RC2===
'''Build 5700''' (build date of [[August 10]], [[2006]]), the first build of the RTM branch, was shown at the Student Day Presentation of Microsoft Tech-Ed 2006 in Australia. It appeared to run faster than the previous Pre-RC1 build 5472 with a few UI improvements.<ref>{{cite news | first=Long | last=Zheng | url=http://www.istartedsomething.com/20060822/teched-day-1-student-day/ | title=TechEd Day 1 - Student Day | publisher=istartedsomething | date=[[2006-08-22]] | accessdate=2006-08-23 }}</ref> A higher build number does not necessarily indicate a newer build. Microsoft began work on the RTM branch at the same time as it was wrapping up the RC1 branch, allowing for mainstream RC1 developers to more easily "flow" into the new development stage. This parallel development helps explain why build 5700 is older than even some pre-RC1 builds.<ref>{{cite web

'''Build 5728''' (build date of [[September 17]], [[2006]]) was released on [[September 22]], [[2006]] to technical beta participants. The following day, Microsoft released a 32-bit version of the build to the public, with a 64-bit version arriving on September 25. On October 1, Microsoft reached its goals for program participation and no longer offered the build to the public. In response to a significant amount of feedback from RC1 testers, 5728 contained many improvements, one of which was the inclusion of a check box in the Sound properties that allowed the user to disable the Windows Vista startup sound.<ref>{{cite web

'''Release Candidate 2 (RC2)''' (built on [[October 3]], [[2006]] with a build number of '''5744.16384'''), was released to CPP members, TAP testers, MSDN/Technet subscribers, and other technical beta testers on Friday, [[October 6]], [[2006]], and was available for download until October 9. Because of an aggressive development schedule, this was the final build that would be officially released to the general public for testing. Nevertheless, all pre-release product keys will work until the final RTM build. Several testers reported that RC2 was faster and more stable than build 5728.<ref>{{cite web

This build fixed many compatibility issues that plagued previous builds. Vista's [[Graphical user interface|GUI]], which continued to be improved, contained some minor tweaks, one of the more prominent of which was the new ability to customize the color, but not the transparency, of maximized windows. In previous builds, windows became predominantly black when maximized, an effect that could not be altered by users.<ref>{{cite web

===Pre-RTM===
Because a [[release to manufacturing]] (RTM) build is the final version of code shipped to retailers and other distributors, the purpose of a pre-RTM build is to eliminate any last "show-stopper" bugs that may prevent the code from responsibly being shipped to customers, as well as anything else that consumers may find annoying. Thus, it is unlikely that any major new features will be introduced; instead, work will focus on Vista's "fit-and-finish". In just a few days, developers had managed to drop Vista's bug count from over 2470 on September 22 to just over 1400 by the time RC2 shipped in early October. However, they still had a ways to go before Vista was ready to RTM. Microsoft's internal processes required Vista's bug count to drop to 500 or fewer before the product could go into escrow for RTM.<ref>{{cite web

Only completely reinstalling Windows would fix the computer.

'''Build 5840''' (build date of [[October 18]] [[2006]]) was made available to internal testers. According to Paul Thurrott, this build did not contain the major bug in build 5824, and testing produced very positive feedback. This build contained a large number of new and final icons, as well as a new set of final wallpapers, including a new default wallpaper based on the Aurora "swoosh" seen in prior builds.<ref>{{cite web

===SP1 Beta===
This build was only released on [[Microsoft Connect]] to selected testers on [[2007-09-24]]. This build was offered optionally through Windows Update through a registry key installed by the tester. This key was later leaked to the net resulting in the deactivation of the key by Microsoft. With this release the build number for Vista jumped to 6001.16659.070916.1443. This build also removed the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) from client computers, to be replaced by a downloadable version at a later date. This build broke the "HP Touch smart" family family of applications, and also caused bugs with resuming from sleep, and in some cases rendered some 64-bit PCs with Trusted Platform Module TPM)chips unable to finish booting.
