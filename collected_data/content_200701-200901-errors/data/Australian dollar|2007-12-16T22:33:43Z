The '''dollar''' is the [[currency]] of the [[Commonwealth of Australia]], including [[Christmas Island]], [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]], and [[Norfolk Island]], as well as the independent [[Pacific Islands|Pacific Island state]]s of [[Kiribati]], [[Nauru]] and [[Tuvalu]]. The Australian dollar's [[ISO 4217]] code is ''AUD'' but it is often abbreviated with the [[dollar sign]] ''$''. ''A$'' or ''AU$'' is often used informally to distinguish it from other [[dollar]]-denominated currencies. It is subdivided into 100 [[cent (currency)|cent]]s.

The Australian dollar is currently the sixth-most-traded currency in world<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.forextradinghq.com/the-australian-dollar-official-currency-of-the-commonwealth-of-australia.html | title=The Australian Dollar  | accessdate=2007-11-23}}</ref> [[exchange rate|foreign exchange markets]] (behind the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]], the [[euro]], the [[yen]], the [[pound sterling]], and the [[swiss franc]]), accounting for approximately 4–5% of worldwide foreign exchange transactions. The Australian dollar is popular with currency traders due to relatively high interest rates in Australia, the relative lack of government intervention in the foreign exchange market, the general stability of the economy and the government, as well as the prevailing view that it offers diversification benefits in a portfolio containing the major world currencies (especially because of its greater exposure to Asian economies and the commodities cycle).

==History==
The dollar was introduced on [[14 February]] [[1966]], not only replacing the [[Australian pound]] (distinct from the [[pound sterling]] since [[1929]]) but also introducing a [[decimalisation|decimal system]].  
[[Image:20royalsfront.jpg|thumb|A 20-royal note]]
[[Image:10royals.jpg|thumb|A 10-royal note]]
===The royal===
In [[1965]], the [[Prime Minister]], [[Robert Menzies]], wished to name the currency "the royal" and other names such as "the austral", "the oz", "the boomer", "the roo", "the kanga", "the emu", "the digger", "the kwid" and, jokingly, "the ming" (the nickname of Menzies) were also proposed. Due to Menzies' influence, the name "royal" was settled upon, and trial designs were prepared and printed by the printing works of the [[Reserve Bank of Australia]]. The unusual choice of name for the currency proved unpopular, and it was later shelved in favour of "dollar".

===The dollar===
On [[14 February]] [[1966]] the dollar was introduced at a rate of two dollars per pound, or ten [[shilling]]s per dollar. At its introduction, it was pegged to sterling at a rate of 1 dollar = 8 shillings (2.5 dollars = 1 pound). In 1967, Australia effectively left the sterling area for the first time. When sterling devalued in 1967 against the U.S. dollar, the Australian dollar did not follow. It maintained its peg to the U.S. dollar at the same rate of 1 Australian dollar = 1.12 U.S. dollars.

==Coins==
[[Image:Oz20cent.jpg|thumb|200px|Australian twenty-cent coin]]
{{main|Coins of the Australian dollar}}
In 1966, coins were introduced in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 cents. 1 dollar coins were introduced in 1984, followed by 2 dollars in 1988. The 1 and 2 cent coins were discontinued in 1991 and withdrawn from circulation.<ref>In commemoration of the 40th anniversary of [[decimal currency]], the 2006 mint [[Proof coinage|Proof]] and [[Coin grading|Uncirculated]] sets included 1 and 2 cent coins.</ref> [[Cash]] transactions are rounded to the nearest 5 cents or rounded down at the option of the retailer. As with most public changes to currency systems, there has been a great amount of [[seignorage]] of these discontinued coins, meaning the vast majority are never going to be worth a significant amount of money. All [[coin]]s portray Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] on the obverse and are produced by the [[Royal Australian Mint]].

Australia has regularly issued commemorative 50 cent coins. The first commemorative 50 cent coin was in 1970, commemorating [[Captain Cook]]'s exploration along the east coast of the Australian continent, followed in 1977 by a coin for [[Queen Elizabeth II]]'s [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Silver Jubilee]], the wedding of [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Charles]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Diana]] in 1981, the [[Brisbane]] [[Commonwealth Games]] in 1982, and the [[Australian Bicentenary]] in 1988. Issues expanded into greater numbers in the [[1990s]] and the [[21st century]], responding to collector demand. Australia has also made special issues of 20 cent and 1 dollar coins.

There are also many Australian five dollar coins of [[aluminium]]/[[bronze]] and [[bimetal|bi-metal]] as well as  many [[silver]] and [[gold]] [[bullion]] coins in higher denominations. These, like the U.S coins of higher denomination than 1 dollar or which are made of precious metals, are not normally used in payment but are still [[legal tender]].

Current Australian 5, 10 and 20 cent coins are identical in size to the former Australian, New Zealand and British sixpence, shilling and two shilling (florin) coins. In 1990 the U.K. replaced these coins with smaller versions, as did New Zealand in 2006 - at the same time discontinuing the 5 cent coin. With a mass of 15.55 grams and a diameter of 31.51mm, the Australian 50 cent coin is one of the largest coins still in circulation today. {{Clarifyme}}

==Banknotes==
{{mainarticle|Banknotes of the Australian dollar}}

===First series===
The first paper issues of Australian dollars were issued in 1966.  The 1, 2, 10 and 20 dollars had exact equivalents in the former pound banknotes. The 5 dollar note was issued in 1967, after the public had become familiar with decimal currency. There had not previously been an equivalent £2 10s note. 

The 1 dollar note was replaced by a coin in 1984, while the 2 dollar note was replaced by a coin in 1988. The 50 dollar note was introduced in 1973 and the 100 dollar note in 1984, in response to inflation requiring larger denominations for transactions.

===Polymer series===
[[Image:Australian $10 note 1988.jpg|thumb|The first polymer banknote, the 1988 Australian $10 note]]
In 1988, the Reserve Bank of Australia issued [[plastic]], specifically [[polypropylene]] [[polymer banknotes]] (which were produced by [[Note Printing Australia]]), to commemorate the bicentenary of European settlement in Australia. These notes contained a transparent window with an optically variable image of [[Captain James Cook]] as a security feature. Australian banknotes were the first in the world to use such features. 

Today all Australian notes are made of polymer.

==Value of the Australian dollar==
The highest value of the Australian dollar since it was floated was 96.68 U.S. cents on [[March 14]] [[1984]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/business/dollar-hits-23year-high/2007/10/12/1191696127737.html | title=Dollar hits 23-year high  | work=[[The_Age]] | date=[[2007-10-12]] | accessdate=2007-10-12}}</ref>  In 2001, the value of one Australian dollar went below 50 U.S. cents for the first time, touching 47.75 U.S. cents in [[April]] [[2001]]<ref>{{cite news | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/BUSINESS/asia/11/12/aust.economy.biz/ | title=Global risk weighs on Howard's agenda | work=[[CNN]] | date=[[2001-11-12]] | accessdate=2007-10-26}}</ref>.  On [[1 November]] [[2007]], the Australian dollar reached a 23-year high against the U.S. dollar, peaking at 93.43 U.S. cents.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601081&sid=aVd5WJBE87AQ&refer=australia | title=Australian Dollar Holds Near 23-Year High After Retail Sales | work=[[Bloomberg]] | date=[[2007-11-01]] | accessdate=2007-11-01}}</ref>

In 1966, when the Australian dollar was introduced, the International [[gold standard]] still operated. The dollar was at that time worth 980 milligrams of gold. As of December 2006 the dollar was worth 38 milligrams of gold.[http://www.dgcsc.org/goldprices.htm]

==Exchange rate policies==
Australia maintained a [[Fixed exchange rate|peg]] to the British pound, reflecting its historical ties as well as a view about the stability in value of the British pound. From 1946 to 1971, Australia maintained a peg to the U.S. dollar under the [[Bretton Woods system]], but it was effectively pegged to sterling until 1967. With the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, Australia converted the mostly-fixed peg to a moving peg against the U.S. dollar. In September 1974, Australia moved to a peg against a basket of currencies called the [[trade weighted index]] (TWI) in an effort to reduce fluctuations associated with its peg to the U.S. dollar. The peg to the TWI was changed to a moving peg in November 1976, causing the actual value of the peg to be periodically adjusted. In December 1983, the  [[Australian Labor Party|Australian Labor]] [[government of Australia|government]] led by [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Bob Hawke]] and [[Treasurer of Australia|Treasurer]] [[Paul Keating]] "[[Floating exchange rate|floated]]" the Australian dollar. From that point, movements in the Australian dollar continued to reflect the strength of its terms of trade. For decades, Australia's reliance upon commodity (mineral and farm) exports has seen the Australian dollar rally during global booms, and fall when mineral prices slumped or when domestic spending overshadowed its export earnings outlook. The currency's high volatility, currency exposure and interest swap has made the AUD one of the most traded currencies in the world, far in excess of the economy's importance (2% of global economic activity).
