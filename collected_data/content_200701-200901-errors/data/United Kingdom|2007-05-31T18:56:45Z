==History==
{{main|History of the United Kingdom}}
[[Image:Sadler, Battle of Waterloo.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[Battle of Waterloo]] marked the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the beginning of the ''[[Pax Britannica]]''.]]
The [[Kingdom of England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland]] had existed as separate sovereign and independent states with their own [[monarchs]] and political structures since the 9th century. The once independent [[Wales|Principality of Wales]] fell under the control of English monarchs from the [[Statute of Rhuddlan]] in 1284. Under the [[Acts of Union 1707]], England (including Wales) and Scotland, which had been in [[personal union]] since the [[Union of the Crowns]] in 1603, agreed to a political union in the form of a unified [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://personal.pitnet.net/primarysources/act.html |title=The Treaty (or Act) of Union, 1707 |publisher= |accessdate=2006-05-15}}</ref> 
The [[Act of Union 1800]] united the Kingdom of Great Britain with the [[Kingdom of Ireland]], which had been gradually brought under English control between 1541 and [[Treaty of Limerick|1691]], to form the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] in 1801.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.actofunion.ac.uk/actofunion.htm#act | title=The Act of Union |publisher=Act of Union Virtual Library |accessdate=2006-05-15}}</ref> Independence for the [[Republic of Ireland]] in 1922 followed the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920|partition]] of the island of Ireland two years previously, with six of the nine [[Counties of Ireland|counties]] of the [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Ulster]] remaining within the {{abbr| UK}}, which then [[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927|changed]] to the current name in 1927 of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]].<ref name="CAIN">{{cite web |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/politics/docs/ait1921.htm |title=The Anglo-Irish Treaty, [[6 December]] [[1921]] |publisher=CAIN |accessdate=2006-05-15}}</ref> (The term Great Britain in a political sense still refers to the three of the four constituent countries, namely England, Scotland and Wales, on the island of Great Britain. The United Kingdom however always formally includes Northern Ireland).

Britain was an important part of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] with [[philosophy|philosophical]] and [[science|scientific]] input and an influential [[literary]] and [[theatrical]] tradition.Over the next century the United Kingdom played a leading role in developing [[Western world|Western]] ideas of [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] with significant contributions to [[literature]], the [[arts]] and [[science]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Ferguson |first=Niall |authorlink=Niall Ferguson |year=2003 |title=Empire: The Rise and Demise of the British World Order |publisher=Basic Books |id=ISBN 0-465-02328-2}}</ref> The wealth of the [[British Empire]], like other [[Great Powers]], was also partly generated by colonial exploitation, including the industrialisation after 1750 of the [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]], with Britain's 18th century shipping fleet, the largest in the world, taking African slaves to the Americas as part of the infamous [[triangular trade]]. At the beginning of the 19th however, Britain passed the [[Slave Trade Act 1807|Slave Trade Act]] and became the first nation to permanently prohibit trade in slaves.

After the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the defeat of [[Napoleon]] in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Britain became the principal power of the 19th century. At its peak, the [[British Empire]], which is considered to be both the United Kingdom and areas that are legally separate entities from, but controlled by, the UK, stretched to almost one-third of the earth and encompassed a third of its population, making it in terms of population and territory the largest in history. 

Over the 19th century the country played an important role in the development of [[parliamentary democracy]], partly via the emergence of a multi-party system. Developments of [[science]] and the [[arts]], building on an 18th century inheritance of figures such as Isaac Newton, and particularly its earlier tradition of [[literature]], were influential.

[[Image:British Empire 1897.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[British Empire]] in 1897. The empire became the largest and most extensive empire in history, its past pervasiveness is one of the main reasons of current spread of the [[English Language]]]]
At the end of the [[Victorian era]], however, the United Kingdom lost its industrial leadership, particularly to the [[United States]], which surpassed the UK in industrial production and trade in the 1890s, as well as to the [[German Empire]]. Britain remained the pre-eminent superpower, and its empire expanded to its maximum size by 1921, gaining the [[League of Nations]] mandate over former German and Ottoman colonies after World War I.

After emergence from the war, the world's first large-scale international broadcasting network, the [[BBC]], was created. The country's [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour movement]] had been in expansion since the late 19th century, and in 1924 the [[First Labour Government (UK)|first Labour government]] came to power. Britain fought [[Nazi Germany]] in [[World War II]], with its [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] allies including [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]] and [[India]], later to be joined by further [[Allies of World War II|allies]]. Wartime leader [[Winston Churchill]] and his successor [[Clement Atlee]] helped plan the post-war world as part of the "Big Three". World War II, however, left the United Kingdom financially and physically damaged. Economically costly wartime [[loans]], loans taken in 1945 from the United States and from Canada, combined with post-war [[Marshall Plan]] aid from the United States started the United Kingdom on the road to recovery.

[[Image:Supermarinespitfire.JPG|thumb|250px|The famous [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] of the [[RAF]]. The RAF won the [[Battle of Britain]] and ended [[Germany]]'s advance in [[western Europe]] during [[World War II]].]]
1945 saw the emergence of the British [[Welfare State]] and one of the world's first and most comprehensive [[National Health Service|Health Service]]s, while the demands of a recovering economy brought people from all over the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] to create a [[multiethnic]] Britain. Although the new postwar limits of Britain's [[political]] role were confirmed by the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956, the international currency of the [[English language|language]] meant the continuing impact of its literature and [[culture]], while at the same time from the 1960s its [[popular culture]] found an influence abroad. Following a period of economic stagnation and industrial strife in the 1970s after a global economic downturn, the 1980s saw the premiership of [[Margaret Thatcher]], under whom a marked break with the post-war political and economic consensus saw, for her supporters, economic recovery, and, for her critics, greater social division. From the mid-1990s onward these trends have largely continued under the leadership of [[Tony Blair]].

The United Kingdom has been a member of the [[European Union]] since 1973. The attitude of the present [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government towards further integration with this organisation is mixed,<ref name=Times>{{cite web |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,17129-1948441,00.html |title=Modest progress but always on back foot |publisher=Times Online |date=[[2005-12-21]] |accessdate=2006-05-16}}</ref> with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] favouring a return of some powers and competencies to the state,<ref name=Conservatives>{{cite web |url=http://www.conservatives.com/tile.do?def=europe.news.campaigns.display.page&obj_id=73417 |title=European Constitution: bad for Britain, bad for Europe |publisher=Conservative Party |accessdate=2006-05-23}}</ref> and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] supportive of current engagement.

==Government and politics==
{{main|Politics of the United Kingdom}}
[[Image:Queen Elisabeth II-cropped.JPG|thumb|left|200px|[[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]]]
The United Kingdom is a [[Constitutional Monarchy]], with [[Executive (government)|executive power]] exercised on behalf of the [[British monarchy|monarch]] by the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] and other [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|cabinet]] ministers. Following the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] only the descendants of [[Sophia of Hanover]] who were Anglican or Protestant, and had not married a Roman Catholic could succeed the throne. The monarch technically holds all executive power and must nominate a [[head of government]] (Prime Minister) that the Parliament agrees upon. The Prime Minister is now, by convention, a member of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]; [[Alec Douglas-Home|Lord Home]] (pronounced "Hume") renounced his title to become prime minister (as Sir Alec Douglas-Home) in 1963-64.

The cabinet, including the Prime Minister, and other senior [[minister (government)|ministers]] collectively make up [[Her Majesty's Government]]. These ministers are drawn from, and are responsible to, [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]. The British system of government has been emulated around the world &ndash; a legacy of the British Empire's [[Colonialism|colonial past]], most notably in the other [[Commonwealth Realms]] &ndash; however the United Kingdom is one of the three countries in the world today that does not have a codified [[constitution]] (the other two being [[New Zealand]] and [[Israel]]), relying instead on traditional [[custom (law)|customs]] and separate pieces of [[constitutional law]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.llrx.com/features/uk2.htm#UK%20Legal%20System |title=A Guide To the UK Legal System |author=Sarah Carter |publisher=[[University of Kent|University of Kent at Canterbury]] |accessdate=2006-05-16}}</ref>
[[Image:Location of the BOTs.png|thumb|250px|Location of the [[British Overseas Territories]]]]
The Prime Minister appoints ministers to government posts, usually from senior members of their own party. Most ministers are members of, and answerable to, the House of Commons (particularly at their Department's "Question Time"). The remaining ministers are usually from the [[House of Lords]], Ministers do not legally have to come from Parliament, but that is the modern day custom, and a Prime Minister who wants to bring someone into the government from outside Parliament will usually first create them a [[Life Peer]], i.e. give them a non-hereditary seat in the House of Lords. The chief advantage put forward for the Parliamentary system of Government is this direct accountability of cabinet members to Parliament. The counter-argument is that the majority of legislators (elected to hold government to account) are (because they are in the PM's party) actually looking to the Prime Minister for personal advancement — and that most politicians (at least in the early stages of their career) appear to view the being an MP not as an honourable and status-awarding end in itself but as the route to office.

[[Image:The mall london.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[The Mall (London)|The Mall]] looking onto [[Buckingham Palace]], the official residence of the British Monarch.]]
In the United Kingdom, the monarch has extensive theoretical powers, but his/her role is mainly, though not exclusively, ceremonial.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199899/cmhansrd/vo990723/debtext/90723-23.htm |title=Hansard (House of Commons Daily Debates) |publisher=United Kingdom Parliament |date=[[1999-07-23]] |pages=Col.1545 |quote=As the Queen's consent has not been obtained, this cannot be dealt with |accessdate=2006-05-17}}</ref> The monarch is an integral part of Parliament (as the "[[Crown-in-Parliament]]"), and theoretically gives Parliament the power to meet and create legislation. An [[Act of Parliament]] does not become law until it has been signed by the monarch (known as [[Royal Assent]]), although not one has refused assent to a bill that has been approved by Parliament since [[Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] in 1708.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld/ldcomp/hlctso29.htm |title=Royal Assent |publisher=United Kingdom Parliament |accessdate=2006-05-17}}</ref> Although the abolition of the monarchy has been suggested, the popularity of the monarchy remains strong in the United Kingdom. Support for a [[Republicanism in the United Kingdom|British republic]] usually fluctuates between 15% and 25% of the population, with roughly 10% undecided or indifferent.<ref name=MORI>{{cite web |url=http://www.mori.com/mrr/2000/c000616.shtml |title=Polls Apart? The Public and the Monarchy |publisher=Market & Opinion Research International |date=[[2000-06-16]] |accessdate=2006-05-14}}</ref>  The present monarch is [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|HM Queen Elizabeth II]] who acceded to the throne in 1952 and was crowned in 1953.

The current Prime Minister is [[Tony Blair]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], who has been in office since 1997 and will be stepping down in June, 2007, along with the Deputy Prime Minister, [[John Prescott]]. Blair will be replaced by [[Gordon Brown]], the present [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. At the 2005 general election, the Labour Party had a majority of 66 seats. However, it is now a 64 seat majority due to a by-election loss to the Liberal Democrats in Scotland. 

[[Image:Westminster palace.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Palace of Westminster]], on the banks of the [[River Thames]], [[London]], houses the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]].]]
[[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] is the national legislature of the United Kingdom. It is the ultimate legislative authority in the United Kingdom, according to the doctrine of [[parliamentary sovereignty]] (however, questions over sovereignty have been brought forward because of the {{abbr|UK}}'s membership of the European Union).<ref name=Times20050914>{{cite web |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1779849,00.htm |title=Europe Wins The Power To Jail British Citizens |publisher=The Times |date=[[2005-09-14]]}}</ref> It is [[bicameral]], composed of the elected [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] and the unelected [[House of Lords]], whose members are mostly appointed. The House of Commons is the more powerful of the two houses. The House of Commons houses 646 members who are directly elected from single-member constituencies based on population. The House of Lords has around 700 members (though the number is not fixed), constituted of [[life peers]], [[hereditary peers]], and bishops of the [[Church of England]]. (Note: the [[House of Lords Act 1999]] removed the automatic inheritance of seats in the Lords and permitted 92 hereditary peers to remain.) The Church of England is the [[established church]] of the state in England only.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cofe.anglican.org/about/history/ |title=The History of the Church of England |publisher=The Archbishops' Council of the Church of England |accessdate=2006-05-24}}</ref>

The Scottish Parliament, National Assembly of Wales and Northern Ireland Assembly each have their own executives and separate law making and constitutional powers, all of which are devolved from Westminster.

==Law==
{{main|Law of the United Kingdom}}
[[Image:Parliament House, Edinburgh.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Parliament House, Edinburgh]] is the seat of the supreme courts of Scotland.]]
The United Kingdom has three distinct [[systems of law]]. [[English law]], which applies in [[England and Wales]], and [[Courts of Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland law]], which applies in Northern Ireland, are based on [[common law|common-law]] principles. [[Scots law]], which applies in Scotland, is a hybrid system based on both common-law and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil-law]] principles. The [[Act of Union 1707]] guarantees the continued existence of a separate law system for Scotland.

The Appellate Committee of the [[House of Lords]] (usually just referred to, as "The House of Lords") is the highest court in the land for all criminal and civil cases in [[England]], [[Wales]], and [[Northern Ireland]], and for all civil cases in Scots law. Recent constitutional changes will see the powers of the House of Lords transfer to a new [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]].<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.dca.gov.uk/consult/supremecourt/supreme.pdf Constitutional reform: A Supreme Court for the United Kingdom]|252&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 258317 bytes -->}}, Department for Constitutional Affairs. Retrieved on [[2006-05-22]]</ref>

In [[England and Wales]], the [[Courts of England and Wales|court system]] is headed by the Supreme Court of Judicature of England and Wales, consisting of the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]], the [[High Court of Justice]] (for civil cases) and the [[Crown Court]] (for criminal cases). In [[Scotland]] the chief courts are the [[Court of Session]], for civil cases, and the [[High Court of Justiciary]], for criminal cases, while the [[sheriff court]] is the Scottish equivalent of the county court.

The [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]], comprising the same members as the Appellate Committee of the [[House of Lords]], is the highest court of appeal for several independent Commonwealth countries, the {{abbr|UK}} overseas territories, and the British crown dependencies.

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of the United Kingdom}}

===Topography===
[[Image:Uk-map.svg|thumb|left|250px|Map of the United Kingdom]]
Most of England consists of lowland terrain, with some mountainous terrain in the north-west ([[Cumbrian Mountains]] of the Lake District), north (the upland moors of the [[Pennines]] and [[limestone]] hills of the [[Peak District]]) and south-west ([[Exmoor]] and [[Dartmoor]]) by the [[Tees-Exe line]]. Lower ranges include the [[limestone]] hills of the [[Isle of Purbeck]], [[Cotswolds]] and [[Lincolnshire Wolds]], and the [[chalk]] downs of the [[Southern England Chalk Formation]]. The main rivers and estuaries are the [[Thames]], [[Severn]] and the [[Humber|Humber Estuary]]. The largest urban area is [[Greater London]]. England's highest mountain is [[Scafell Pike]], which is in the [[Lake District]] 978 m (3,208&nbsp;ft). 
[[Scotland's geography]] is varied, with [[Scottish Lowlands|lowlands]] in the south and east and [[Scottish Highlands|highlands]] in the north and west, including [[Ben Nevis]], the highest mountain in the British Isles at 1,344 m (4,406&nbsp;ft). There are many long and deep sea arms, [[firth]]s, and [[loch]]s. There are nearly eight hundred [[List of islands of Scotland|islands in Scotland]], mainly west and north of the mainland, notably the [[Hebrides]], [[Orkney Islands]] and [[Shetland Islands]]. In total, it is estimated that the {{abbr|UK}} includes around one thousand islands.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.celticlegend.co.uk/dialysis/scotland.htm |title=Dialysis Scotland |publisher=Celtic Legend |accessdate=2006-05-22}}</ref> 
[[Image:Lakeland View.jpg|thumb|200px|The panorama across Eskdale from [[Ill Crag]], in the [[Lake District]]]]
Wales is mostly mountainous, the highest peak being [[Snowdon]] (''Yr Wyddfa'') at 1,085 m or 3,560&nbsp;ft above sea level. North of the mainland is the island of [[Anglesey]] (''Ynys Môn''). 
Northern Ireland, making up the north-eastern part of Ireland, is mostly hilly. The province is home to one of the {{abbr|UK}}'s [[World Heritage Sites]], the [[Giant's Causeway]], which consists of more than 40,000 six-sided basalt columns up to 12 m (40 ft) high. [[Lough Neagh]], the largest body of water in the [[British Isles]], by surface area (388&nbsp;km²&nbsp;/&nbsp;150&nbsp;mi²), can be found in [[Northern Ireland]] <ref>{{cite web |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/ni/geog.htm |title=Geography of Northern Ireland |publisher=University of Ulster |accessdate=2006-05-22}}</ref>. The highest peak is [[Slieve Donard]] at 849 metres (2,786&nbsp;ft) in the province's [[Mourne Mountains]].

The greatest distance between two points on the UK mainland of Great Britain is 1,350 km (839 miles) between [[Land's End]] in [[Cornwall]] (near [[Penzance]]) and [[John O'Groats]] in [[Caithness]] (near [[Thurso]]), a two day journey by car. When measured directly north-south it is a little over 1,100 km in length and is a fraction under 500 km at its widest.

As a comparison, countries of very similar surface area include [[Romania]], [[Ecuador]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Uganda]] and [[Laos]].

===Climate===
{{main|Climate of the United Kingdom}}
[[England]] has a temperate climate, with plentiful rainfall all year round, though the seasons are quite variable in temperature. However, temperatures rarely fall below −4&nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]] and will only rise above 32&nbsp;°C in the height of the summer. The prevailing wind is from the southwest, bringing mild and wet weather to England regularly, from the Atlantic Ocean. It is driest in the east, warmest in the southwest in winter (closest to Atlantic currents), and warmest in the southeast in summer (closest to the European mainland). Snowfall can occur in winter and early spring, though it is not that common away from high ground.

The highest temperature recorded in England is 38.5&nbsp;°C on [[10 August]] [[2003]] at Brogdale, near Faversham, Kent.<!--?: [1].--> The lowest temperature ever recorded in England is −26.1&nbsp;°C on [[10 January]] [[1982]] at Edgmond, near Newport, Shropshire.<!--?: [2]-->

[[Wales]]'s climate is similar to that of England, with the highest maximum temperature recorded at 35.2&nbsp;°C in Hawarden Bridge, Flintshire on [[2 August]] [[1990]] and the lowest minimum temperature at -23.3&nbsp;°C in Rhayader, Radnorshire on [[21 January]] [[1940]].<!--?: [1]-->

The climate of [[Scotland]] is temperate and oceanic, and tends to be very changeable. It is warmed by the Gulf Stream from the Atlantic, and as such is much warmer than areas on similar latitudes, for example Oslo, Norway. However, temperatures are generally lower than in the rest of the {{abbr|UK}}, with the coldest ever {{abbr|UK}} temperature of -27.2 °C recorded at Braemar, Aberdeenshire, on [[11 February]] [[1895]] and [[10 January]] [[1982]] and also at Altnaharra, Sutherland, on [[30 December]] [[1995]]. Winter maximums average 6&nbsp;°C in the lowlands, with summer maximums averaging 18&nbsp;°C. The highest temperature recorded was 32.9&nbsp;°C at Greycrook, Scottish Borders on [[9 August]] [[2003]].

Generally, western Scotland is warmer than the east because of the influence of the Atlantic Ocean currents (the [[Gulf Stream]]) and the colder surface temperatures of the North Sea. [[Tiree]], in the Inner Hebrides, is the sunniest place in Scotland. Rainfall varies widely across Scotland. The western highlands of Scotland are the wettest place, with annual rainfall often exceeding 2,000&nbsp;mm, and exceeding 3,000&nbsp;mm (120 [[inch]]es) over some mountain summits. In comparison, much of lowland Scotland receives less than 800&nbsp;mm (31 inches) annually. Heavy snowfall is not common in the lowlands, but becomes more common with altitude. Braemar experiences an average of fifty-nine snow days per year, while coastal areas have an average of less than ten days.

The whole of [[Northern Ireland]] has a temperate maritime climate, rather wetter in the west than the east, although cloud cover is persistent across the region. The weather is comparatively unpredictable at all times of the year, and although the seasons are distinct, they are considerably less pronounced than in interior Europe or the eastern seaboard of North America. Average daytime maximums in Belfast are 6.5&nbsp;°C in January and 17.5&nbsp;°C in July. The damp climate and extensive deforestation in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries resulted in much of the region being covered in rich green grassland. The highest maximum temperature was set at 30.8&nbsp;°C at Knockarevan, near Belleek, County Fermanagh on [[30 June]] [[1976]] and at Belfast on [[12 July]] [[1983]], whilst the lowest minimum temperature recorded at -17.5&nbsp;°C at Magherally, near Banbridge, County Down on [[1 January]] [[1979]].<!--?: [16]-->

The United Kingdom can sometimes be affected by blocking highs during summer, and along with the rest of Europe, has been hit by severe heat waves in recent years.

===Cities and urban areas===
{{main|City status in the United Kingdom}}
The four capitals of the United Kingdom's constituent parts are [[London]] (United Kingdom) & (England), [[Edinburgh]] (Scotland), [[Cardiff]] (Wales) and [[Belfast]] (Northern Ireland). 

====Largest cities====
{{main|List of United Kingdom cities by population}}

<!--See daughter article for these figures.  They are urban areas according to the 2001 census, not local authority districts.-->
* [[London]] - 	7,172,091 (though the [[City of London]] proper is one of the smallest cities in England)
* [[Birmingham]] - 970,892
* [[Glasgow]] - 629,501 

Other major cities with urban area populations in excess of 250,000 inhabitants are [[Belfast]], [[Bradford]], [[Bristol]], [[Cardiff]], [[Coventry]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Kingston Upon Hull]], [[Leeds]], [[Leicester]], [[Liverpool]], [[Manchester]], [[Nottingham]], [[Sheffield]], [[Stoke on Trent]] and [[Wolverhampton]].

===Population===
At the April [[2001 UK Census|2001 {{abbr|UK}} Census]], the United Kingdom's population was 58,789,194, the third largest in the [[European Union]] (behind [[Germany]] and [[France]]) and the twenty-first largest in the world.

The UK's overall population density is one of the highest in the world. About a quarter of the population lives in England's prosperous southeast and is predominantly urban and suburban,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/pyramids/pages/j.asp |title=Census 2001: South East |publisher=Office for National Statistics |accessdate=2006-05-14}}</ref> with an estimated 7,517,700 in the capital of London.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/lmp/la/2038431860/subreports/pop_time_series/report.aspx |title=All people population: City of London |publisher=Office for National Statistics |accessdate=2006-08-31}}</ref> The United Kingdom's high literacy rate (99%) is attributable to universal state education introduced for the primary level in 1870 and secondary level in 1900 (except in Scotland where it was introduced in 1696, see [[Education in Scotland]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.humana.org/Article.asp?TxtID=223&SubMenuItemID=183&MenuItemID=43 |title=United Kingdom |publisher=Humana |accessdate=2006-05-18}}</ref> Education is mandatory from ages five to sixteen (15 if born in late July or August).

===Migration and ethnicity===
{{main|Ethnic groups of the United Kingdom}}
Located as they are on a group of islands close to [[Continental Europe]], the lands now constituting the United Kingdom have historically been subject to many invasions and migrations, especially from Scandinavia and the continent - including Roman occupation for several centuries. Present day Britons are descended mainly from the varied ethnic stocks that settled there before the eleventh century. The pre-Celtic, Celtic, Roman, Anglo-Saxon, and Norse influences were blended on Great Britain under the Normans, Scandinavian [[Viking]]s who had lived in northern France (Normandy).

More recent immigration has come through interaction with continental [[Europe]] and international ties forged by the [[British Empire]]. Since [[World War Two]] the {{abbr|UK}} has absorbed substantial immigration, with Europe, Africa and South Asia being the biggest areas from where people currently emigrate. As of [[2001 British Census|2001]], 13.1% of the {{abbr|UK}}'s population identified themselves as an [[ethnic minority]] (including non-British white groups).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cre.gov.uk/diversity/map.html |title=Multi Ethnic Britain |publisher=Commission for Racial Equality |accessdate=2007-04-20}}</ref> 7.9% were from a non-white ethnic group.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/CCI/nugget.asp?ID=764&Pos=4&ColRank=1&Rank=176 |title=Ethnicity: 7.9% from a non-White ethnic group |publisher=Office for National Statistics |date=[[2004-06-24]] |accessdate=2007-04-02}}</ref>

The most recent pattern of immigration to the {{abbr|UK}} began in May 2004 when the European Union was expanded. Figures published in May 2007 indicate that 630,000 people applied to the scheme between [[1 May]] [[2004]] and [[31 March]] [[2007]], of whom 605,375 were accepted.<ref>Home Office, Department for Work and Pensions, HM Revenue & Customs and Communities and Local Government, [http://www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk/6353/aboutus/AccessionMonitoringReport11.pdf Accession Monitoring Report: A8 Countries, May 2004-March 2007], [[22 May]] [[2007]], accessed [[26 May]] [[2007]].</ref> This figure is for arrivals only and does not take account of people leaving, hence [[Net migration rate|net migration]] is likely to be lower.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5273356.stm |title='Nearly 600,000' new EU migrants |publisher=BBC News |date=[[2006-08-22]] |accessdate=2006-08-22}}</ref> 55 per cent of people arriving from the new EU member states to work in 2006 stated that they planned to stay in the UK for less than three months.

===Language===
{{main|Languages in the United Kingdom}}
[[Image:Anglospeak.png |thumb|250px|Countries where [[English language|English]] has official or ''de facto'' official language status.]]
Though the {{abbr|UK}} does not have a [[De jure|''de jure'']] official language, the predominant [[spoken language]] is [[English language|English]], a [[West Germanic]] language descended from [[Old English]], featuring a large number of borrowings from [[Old Norse]] and [[Norman language|Norman]]. The other indigenous languages are [[Scots language|Scots]] (which is closely related to English) and the [[Insular Celtic languages]] (which are not). The latter fall into two groups: the P-Celtic languages ([[Welsh language|Welsh]] and the [[Cornish language]]); and the Q-Celtic languages ([[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Scottish Gaelic]]). Celtic dialectal influences from [[Cumbric]] persisted in Northern England for many centuries, most famously in a unique set of numbers used for counting sheep. 

The English language has spread to all corners of the world (largely due to the British Empire) and has thus become [[International English|the business language of the world]]. Worldwide, it is [[English language learning and teaching|taught as a second language]] more than any other.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cepr.org/pubs/new-dps/dplist.asp?dpno=2055 |title=English-Language Dominance, Literature and Welfare |author=Jacques Melitz |publisher=Centre for Economic Policy Research |date=1999 |accessdate=2006-05-26}}</ref> The United Kingdom's Celtic languages are also spoken by small groups around the globe, mainly [[Scottish Gaelic in Canada|Gaelic]] in Nova Scotia, [[Canada]], and Welsh in [[Patagonia]], [[Argentina]].

Recent immigrants, especially from the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], speak many other languages. The United Kingdom has the largest number of [[Gujarati]], [[Hindi]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Urdu]], and [[Punjabi]] speakers outside of Asia.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}It has recently acquired many speakers of Eastern European languages, notably [[Polish]].

===Religion===
{{Main|Religion in the United Kingdom}}
[[Image:Canterbury Cathedral - Portal Nave Cross-spire.jpeg|thumb|left|200px|[[Canterbury Cathedral]] is the mother church of the [[Church of England]], which itself is the mother church of the [[Anglican Communion]].]]

People identify themselves with [[religion]] in the UK for both cultural and religious reasons and this is reflected by the disparity between the figures for those believing in a [[god]] and those identifying themselves with a particular religion. 

====Christianity====
[[Image:Westminster abbey west.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Westminster Abbey]] is used for the [[coronation]] of all [[British Monarchs]], who are also made the head of the [[Church of England]].]]
The UK is traditionally a Christian state. Of the four constituent countries that make up the United Kingdom, only [[England]] has a [[state]] faith in the form of an [[established church]]. [[Christianity]] is the majority religion, and a wide variety of Christian [[churches]], [[denominations]], and [[sects]] exists.

[[Christianity]] in the UK, however, is on the decline.  The [[Tearfund]] Survey<ref name=Tearfund_Survey>{{cite web |url=http://www.tearfund.org/webdocs/Website/News/Final%20churchgoing%20report.pdf |title=Tearfund Survey 2007 |accessdate=2007-05-05}}</ref> in 2007 revealed 53% identifing themselves as Christian compared to 71.6% in the 2001 UK Census<ref name=Christians>{{cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=293 |title=UK Census 2001 |accessdate=2007-04-22}}</ref>. Only 7% of people in the UK are actually practising Christians. [[Christianity]] was first introduced to ''[[Roman Britain|Britannia]]'' (modern [[England and Wales]]) by the [[Ancient Roman|Romans]]. {{Fact|date=February 2007}} Each of the four countries of the United Kingdom has distinctive churches. 

[[Scotland]] and [[northern England]] were [[Evangelism|evangelised]] first, by [[Celtic missionaries]] from [[Ireland]], such as [[Saint Ninian|Ninian]], [[Columba]] and [[Aidan of Lindisfarne|Aidan]]. [[Augustine of Canterbury|Augustine]] was subsequently sent to southern England by [[Pope Gregory I]] in 597.

The English Church split from [[Church of Rome|Rome]] in 1534, during the reign of [[Henry VIII of England]] (see [[English Reformation]]). Today, the [[Church of England]] is the officially established [[Christian]] church in England, and acts as the 'mother' and senior branch of the worldwide [[Anglican Communion]]. The [[British monarch]] is required to be a member of the Church of England under the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] and is the [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|Supreme Governor]]. The senior bishop of Church of England is the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].

The [[Church of Scotland]] (known informally as the [[Kirk]]) broke with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in 1560 (see [[Calvinism]] and [[Scottish Reformation]]). Today it is a [[Presbyterian]] church, recognised as the [[national church]] of Scotland, and not subject to state control. The British monarch is an ordinary member, and is required to swear an oath to "defend the security" of the Church at the coronation. The [[Scottish Episcopal Church]], which is part of the Anglican Communion, dates from the final establishment of Presbyterianism in Scotland in 1690. Although it is in [[full communion]] with the Church of England, it is not a 'daughter church' of the Church of England, and is proud of its own independent origins and history. Further splits in the Church of Scotland, especially in the nineteenth century, led to the creation of various other Presbyterian churches in Scotland, including the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Church of Scotland]]. 

In the 1920s, the [[Church in Wales]] was separated from the Church of England and became [[Disestablishment|disestablished]], i.e. lost its "official" status as the state religion. However the Church in Wales remains in the [[Anglican Communion]]. [[Methodism]] and other independent churches are traditionally strong in Wales.

The Anglican [[Church of Ireland]] was disestablished in the nineteenth century. It covers the entire island of [[Ireland]], ie. both [[Northern Ireland]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]]. In Northern Ireland the [[Roman Catholicism in Ireland|Catholic Church in Ireland]] is the largest single denomination, although [[Protestant]]s are in the majority overall. The [[Presbyterian Church in Ireland]] is the largest Protestant denomination and is in terms of theology and history closely linked to the Church of Scotland

The [[Roman Catholic Church in Great Britain|Roman Catholic Church]] is the second largest denomination of Christianity in the {{abbr|UK}}. After the [[Protestant Reformation]], strict laws were passed against Catholics; these were removed by the [[Catholic Emancipation]] laws in  1829. There are separate Catholic hierarchies for [[Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales|England and Wales]], [[Roman Catholic Church in Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Roman Catholic Church in Ireland|Ireland]].

Other large Christian groups include the [[Methodists]] (founded by [[John Wesley]] in London) and the [[Baptists]]. There are also growing [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] or [[Pentecostal]] churches, many of which have flourished with [[Immigration to the United Kingdom|immigration]] from around the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and beyond.

====Islam====
[[Islam in the United Kingdom|Muslims]] are believed to number over 1.8 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3933-2299410,00.html |title=We need imams who can speak to young Muslims in their own words |accessdate=2006-08-09 |date=[[2006-08-05]] |publisher=The Times}}</ref> Masjids are a quite common sight in a few parts of modern day Britain. The biggest groups are of [[Pakistan]]i, [[Bangladesh]]i and [[India]]n origin. More recently, [[refugees]] from [[Somalia]], [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]], [[Balkan]] and the [[Arab]] countries have slightly increased Britain's Muslim population. The 2006 controversy over the [[burqa]], brought up in comments by [[Jack Straw (politician)|Jack Straw]], reflects a split between some Britons [[Criticism of Islam|questioning the extent to which traditionalist forms of Islam are compatible]] with British society, and others who are content with Muslim integration in Britain.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/10/07/uk.straw/ |title=Veil: British papers back Straw |accessdate=2006-05-11 |date=[[2006-07-10]] |publisher=CNN}}</ref>

====Dharmic Religions====
Religions of [[India]]n origin, such as [[Hinduism]] and [[Sikhism]], also enjoy an increased following in Britain. As of the 2001 census, there are about 560,000 Hindus and 340,000 Sikhs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/profiles/uk.asp |title=Census 2001 - Profiles |accessdate=2007-01-27 |publisher=Office for National Statistics}}</ref> It is likely that these figures have increased since 2001.

====Irreligion====
Although the 2001 UK [[Census]] revealed 14.6% of the population identified themselves as having no religious beliefs, the 2005 Eurobarometer report showed that 62%<ref name=Atheists>{{PDFlink|[http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_225_report_en.pdf Eurobarometer poll conducted in 2005]|1.64&nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 1722129 bytes -->}}.

The British were the first in the world to enter the [[Industrial Revolution]], and, like most industrialising countries at the time, initially concentrated on heavy industries such as [[shipbuilding]], [[coal mining]], [[steel]] production, and [[textiles]]. The empire created an overseas market for British products, allowing the United Kingdom to dominate international trade in the 19th century. However, as other nations industrialised and surplus labour from [[agriculture]] began to dry up couple with economic decline after two world wars, the United Kingdom began to lose its economic advantage. As a result, heavy industry declined, by degrees, throughout the 20th century. The British service sector, however, has grown substantially, and now makes up about 73% of GDP.<ref>{{cite web |date=[[2006-04-26]] |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/Product.asp?vlnk=9333 |title=Index of Services (experimental) |publisher=Office for National Statistics |accessdate=2006-05-24}}</ref>
[[Image:London.bankofengland.arp.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Bank of England]]; the [[central bank]] of the United Kingdom.]]
The service sector of the United Kingdom is dominated by [[financial services]], especially in banking and insurance. London is the world's largest financial centre with the [[London Stock Exchange]], the [[London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange]], and the [[Lloyd's of London]] insurance market all based in [[City of London|The City]]. It also has the largest concentration of foreign bank branches in the world. In the past decade, a rival financial centre in London has grown in the [[London Docklands|Docklands]] area, with [[HSBC]] and [[Barclays plc|Barclays Bank]] relocating their head offices there. Many multinational companies that are not primarily UK-based have chosen to site their European or rest-of-world headquarters in London: an example is the US financial services firm [[Citigroup]]. The Scottish capital, [[Edinburgh]], also has one of the large financial centres of [[Europe]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marklazarowicz.org.uk/parliament/speeches2003/4.30(WH).htm |title=Debate on Scottish financial services industry |first=Mark |last=Lazarowicz (Labour MP) |date=[[2003-04-30]] |accessdate=2006-05-16}}</ref>

[[Tourism in the United Kingdom|Tourism]] is very important to the British economy. With over 27 million tourists a year, the United Kingdom is [[World Tourism Rankings|ranked]] as the sixth major tourist destination in the world.<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.world-tourism.org/facts/eng/pdf/highlights/2005_eng_high.pdf International Tourism Receipts]|1.10&nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 1160859 bytes -->}}.

The British manufacturing sector, however, has greatly diminished, relative to the economy as a whole, since World War II. It is still a significant part of the economy, but only accounted for one-sixth of national output in 2003.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dti.gov.uk/ministers/speeches/hewitt150704b.html |title=TUC Manufacturing Conference |author=Patricia Hewitt |publisher=Department for Trade and Industry |date=[[2004-07-15]] |accessdate=2006-05-16}}</ref> The [[British motor industry]] is a significant part of this sector, although it has diminished with the collapse of [[MG Rover]] and most of the industry is foreign owned. Civil and defence aircraft production is led by the United Kingdom's largest aerospace firm, [[BAE Systems]], and the continental European firm [[EADS]], the owners of [[Airbus]]. [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] holds a major share of the global aerospace engines market. The chemical and pharmaceutical industry is also strong in the {{abbr|UK}}, with the world's second and sixth largest pharmaceutical firms ([[GlaxoSmithKline]] and [[AstraZeneca]], respectively)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dti.gov.uk/sectors/biotech/pharmaceutical/page10219.html |title=The Pharmaceutical sector in the UK |accessdate=2007-02-27 |publisher=Department of Trade and Industry}}</ref> being based in the {{abbr|UK}}.

The [[creative industries]] accounted for 7.3% GVA in 2004 and grew at an average of 5% per annum between 1997 and 2004.<ref>{{cite web |date=[[2007-03-09]] |url=http://www.culture.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/70156235-8AB8-48F9-B15B-78A326A8BFC4/0/CreativeIndustriesEconomicEstimates2006.pdf |title=Creative Industries Economic Estimates |publisher=DCMS |accessdate=2007-03-09}}</ref>

The United Kingdom's agriculture sector accounts for only 0.9% of the country's GDP.<ref>{{cite web |date=[[2005-02-28]] |url=http://www.travlang.com/factbook/print/uk.html |title=CIA World Factbook - United Kingdom |publisher=CIA |accessdate=2007-02-08}}</ref>
 
The {{abbr|UK}} has large coal, [[natural gas]], and [[Petroleum|oil]] reserves, although the [[natural gas]] and [[Petroleum|oil]] reserves are diminishing. Primary energy production accounts for about 10% of [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP),{{Fact|date=February 2007}} one of the highest shares of any industrial state. 

Government involvement throughout the economy is exercised by the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] (currently [[Gordon Brown]]) who heads [[HM Treasury]], but the [[Prime Minister]] (currently [[Tony Blair]]), is [[First Lord of the Treasury]]; the Chancellor of the Exchequer is the Second Lord of the Treasury. However since 1997, the [[Bank of England]], headed by the [[Governor of the Bank of England]], has control of interest rates and other monetary policy. The UK government has greatly increased [[public sector]] spending (i.e. government spending of taxes) since 1995, and annual spending on investment in infrastructure has grown from £5.6 billion in 1997 to £29 billion in 2006.

==Currency==
[[Image:20 pound not 2007.PNG|thumb|250px|New [[Bank of England]] £20 note.]]
The currency of the {{abbr|UK}} is the [[pound sterling]], represented by the symbol '''£'''. The [[Bank of England]] is the [[central bank]], responsible for issuing currency. Banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland retain the right to issue their own notes, subject to retaining enough Bank of England notes in reserve to cover the issue. The {{abbr|UK}} chose not to join the [[Euro]] at the currency's launch, although the government has pledged to hold a public referendum for deciding membership if "[[five economic tests]]" are met. {{abbr|UK}} public opinion is against the notion.<ref>{{cite web |date=[[2005-02-28]] |url=http://www.mori.com/polls/2005/citigroup-feb.shtml |title=EMU Entry And EU Constitution |publisher=MORI |accessdate=2006-05-17}}</ref>

==Transport==
{{main|Transport in the United Kingdom}}
The government's [[Department for Transport]] oversees the well-developed transport system in the United Kingdom. A radial road network of 29,145 miles (46,632&nbsp;[[Kilometre|km]]) of main roads is centred on [[London]], [[Edinburgh]] and [[Belfast]], whilst, in [[Great Britain]], a motorway network of 2,173 miles (3,477&nbsp;km) is centred on [[Birmingham]] and London. There are a further 213,750 miles (342,000&nbsp;km) of paved roads. 

The [[National Rail]] network of 10,072 [[route mile]]s ({{nowrap|16,116 [[Route kilometre|route km]]}}) in Great Britain and 189 route miles (303&nbsp;route&nbsp;km) in [[Northern Ireland]] carries over 18,000 passenger trains and 1,000 freight trains daily. Urban rail networks are also well developed in London and several other cities. 

[[Heathrow Airport]] is the world's busiest international [[airport]], and being an island nation the UK has a considerable network of ports, which received over 558 million tonnes of goods in 2003-04.

==Administrative subdivisions==
{{main|Subdivisions of the United Kingdom}}
The United Kingdom is divided into four ''[[home nations]]'' or ''[[Constituent country|constituent countries]]''. Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland each have a parliament or assembly and a devolved executive. England has no national parliament or government; it is ruled directly by the UK government.

Each nation is further subdivided for the purposes of [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local government]]. The Queen appoints a [[Lord-Lieutenant]] as her personal representative in lieutenancy areas across the {{abbr|UK}}; this is little more than a ceremonial role. The following table highlights the arrangements for local government, lieutenancy areas and cities across the home nations of the {{abbr|UK}}:

Historically, the four nations were divided into [[Traditional counties of the British Isles|counties]] as areas for local government administration. Although these are still used to some extent for this purpose and as geographical areas, they are no longer the sole basis for [[local]] government administration.

In recent years, England has, for some purposes, been divided into nine intermediate-level [[Regions of England|Government Office Regions]]. Each region is made up of [[metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England|counties]] and [[unitary authorities]], apart from [[London]], which consists of [[London borough]]s. Although at one point it was intended that each or some of these regions would be given its own elected regional assembly, the plan's future is uncertain following a rejection, by referendum, of a proposed assembly in the [[North East England|North East]] region.

[[City status in the United Kingdom|City status]] is governed by [[Royal Charter]]. There are sixty-six British cities: fifty in England; six in Scotland; five in Wales; and five in Northern Ireland.

The [[British crown|Crown]] has sovereignty over the [[Isle of Man]] and the [[Bailiwick]]s of [[Jersey]] and [[Guernsey]]. Collectively, these three territories are known as the [[Crown dependencies]], lands owned by the [[British monarch]] but not part of the United Kingdom. They are also not part of the European Union. However, the Parliament of the United Kingdom has the authority to legislate for the dependencies, and the British government manages their foreign affairs and defence. 

The {{abbr|UK}} also has fourteen [[British overseas territory|overseas territories]] around the world, the last remaining territories of the [[British Empire]]. The overseas territories are also not considered part of the {{abbr|UK}}, but in most cases the local populations have British citizenship and the right to abode in the {{abbr|UK}}. This has been the case since 2002.

==Foreign relations==
{{main|Foreign relations of the United Kingdom}}
The United Kingdom has extensive influence throughout the world, reinforced by its historical links forged over the past five centuries.{{Fact|date=April 2007}} The United Kingdom is one of the permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]]. It is also a large member state of the [[European Union]], and is one of the three 'big powers' along with Germany and France.  Britain's close allies outside of [[Europe]] include the [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and [[New Zealand]]. With its membership of the [[G8]] and [[NATO]], British influence is high in international institutions. Britain's global presence is amplified further through its extensive trading relations and its armed forces, which maintains approximately eighty military installations and other deployments around the globe.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

==Armed Forces==
{{main|British Armed Forces}}

The [[British Army|Army]], [[Royal Navy|Navy]] and [[Royal Air Force|Air Force]] are collectively known as the '''British Armed Forces''' or '''Her Majesty's Armed Forces''' and officially the '''Armed Forces of the Crown'''. The [[Commander-in-Chief]] is the monarch, [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and they are managed by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]. The armed forces are controlled by the [[Defence Council of the United Kingdom|Defence Council]] currently headed by [[Air Chief Marshal]] [[Jock Stirrup|Sir Jock Stirrup]].

The British Armed Forces maintains an arsenal of advanced weapons systems including the [[Challenger 2]] tank and the BAe Eurofighter Typhoon jet fighter.

The United Kingdom possesses a comprehensive nuclear arsenal (one of the [[List of countries with nuclear weapons|small number of countries]] to do so), utilising the submarine-based [[Trident missile|Trident II]] ballistic missile system with nuclear warheads. These [[Vanguard class submarine]]s were designed and built by [[Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering Ltd|VSEL]] (now [[BAE Systems Submarines]]) at [[Barrow-in-Furness]].

The British Armed Forces are charged with protecting the United Kingdom and its overseas territories, promoting the United Kingdom's wider security interests, and supporting international peacekeeping efforts. They are active and regular participants in [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) and other coalition operations.

The 36,320-member [[Royal Navy]] operates the United Kingdom's nuclear deterrent, which consists of four [[Trident missile]]-armed submarines, while the [[Royal Marines]] are the Royal Navy's [[Light Infantry]] units for [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious]] operations and for specialist reinforcement forces in and beyond the [[NATO]] area. This puts total active duty military personnel in the range of 190,000 deployed in over eighty countries. 

There are also reserve forces supporting the regular military. These include an army reserve, the [[Territorial Army]] (TA), the Royal Naval Reserve (RNR), [[Royal Marines Reserve]] (RMR) and the [[Royal Auxiliary Air Force]] (RAuxAF). About 9% of the regular armed forces is made up of women, a figure that is higher for the reserve forces.

The [[United Kingdom Special Forces]], principally the [[Special Air Service]] (SAS) and [[Special Boat Service]] (SBS), provide troops trained for quick, mobile, military responses in [[counter-terrorism]], land, maritime and [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious operations]], often where secrecy or covert operations are required. 

Despite the United Kingdom's wide-ranging capabilities, recent pragmatic defence policy has a stated assumption that "the most demanding operations" would be undertaken as part of a coalition.<ref>Office for National Statistics ''{{abbr|UK}} 2005: The Official Yearbook of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'', p. 89 </ref> [[Bosnian War|Bosnia]], [[Kosovo War|Kosovo]], [[2001 war in Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] (Operations [[Operation Veritas|VERITAS]], FINGAL and [[Operation Herrick|HERRICK]]), [[Iraq]] (Ops [[Operation Granby|GRANBY]], [[Operation Desert Fox|DESERT FOX]], [[Operation Telic|TELIC]] and the [[Iraqi no-fly zones|no-fly zones]]) may all be taken as precedent; the last war in which the British military fought alone was the [[Falklands War]] of 1982, with full-scale combat operations lasting almost three months.

==Culture==
{{main|Culture of the United Kingdom}}

===Education===
[[Image:KingsCollegeChapelWest.jpg|thumb|left|175px|[[University of Cambridge]], [[Cambridgeshire]], [[England]].]]

{{further|[[Education in the United Kingdom]]}}
The United Kingdom contains some of the world's leading seats of higher education, such as the universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], along with [[Imperial College London|Imperial College]], the [[London School of Economics]], [[King's College London]] (KCL) and [[University College London|University College]] (UCL) of the [[University of London]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ed.sjtu.edu.cn/rank/2005/ARWU2005_Top100.htm |title=Top 500 World Universities (1-100) |publisher=Shanghai Jiao Tong University |date=2005 |accessdate=2006-05-15}}</ref> 

In 2007 there are 112 universities/university colleges in the UK. This amounts to 138 university-level institutions if the distinct constituent colleges of the University of London and [[University of Wales]] are defined as separate universities. Most of the UK's major cities are home to two or more universities.

Parts of the United Kingdom use a segregation system in their state-sector schooling. In these areas parents may choose to enter their children into the [[11%2B|Eleven Plus]], an entrance test to a specific group of elite state [[Grammar_schools_in_the_United_Kingdom|Grammar schools]]. However some Grammar Schools have an additional test named an Entrance Exam, as well as the Eleven Plus. But those who do not take the test, or do not reach the mark necessary for entrance to these schools, are usually allocated a place at a [[Comprehensive_school|comprehensive school]], where children are not selected on the basis of academic aptitude.  This is a controversial system as it gives greater opportunities to high-achieving students possibly at the expense of other students.{{Fact|date=May 2007}} This has lead some to accuse the grammar school system of promoting elitism.{{Fact|date=May 2007}}

The United Kingdom also has an extensive private education system, with some of these independent schools confusingly known as [[Public_school_%28UK%29|Public Schools]].

===Science===

The United Kingdom has played a significant role in the development of science. Ideas on the scientific method were discussed by [[Francis Bacon]] in the early seventeenth century. In the late seventeenth century, [[Sir Isaac Newton]] was a major contributor to classical physics, notably illuminating [[gravity]]. Other later notable physicists from the UK include [[James Clerk Maxwell]] who unified electromagnetism, [[Lord Kelvin]] of the [[Kelvin]] scale, [[Michael Faraday]] another investigator of electromagnetism, and [[Joseph Thomson]] who showed that the electron was a subatomic particle. In chemistry, [[Henry Cavendish]] discovered hydrogen. In biology, [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Wallace]] proposed evolution by [[natural selection]] providing an overarching theory of biology. Later [[Francis Crick]] was involved in understanding the structure of DNA. Major scientific journals are produced in the UK including ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' and ''[[The Lancet]]''. In 2006, it was reported that the {{abbr|UK}} was the most productive source of research after the United States; producing 9% of the world's scientific research papers with a 12% share of citations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/research/story/0,,1736095,00.html |title=Britain second in world research rankings |publisher=The Guardian |date=[[2006-03-21]] |accessdate=2006-05-14}}</ref> It has produced innumerable scholars, scientists and engineers including [[Sir Isaac Newton]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Adam Smith]], [[James Clerk Maxwell]], [[Lord Kelvin]], [[Sir Humphry Davy]], [[Joseph John Thomson]], [[Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher]], [[Michael Faraday]], [[Charles Darwin]], [[Alexander Fleming]], [[Francis Crick]] and [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]; the nation is credited with numerous scientific discoveries including [[hydrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[gravity]], the [[electron]], the [[DNA|structure of DNA]], [[human evolution]] and [[natural selection]] and inventions including the [[marine chronometer]], [[television]], the [[jet engine]], the modern [[bicycle]], the electronic [[computer]] and the later development of the [[World Wide Web#Origins|World Wide Web]], largely attributed to [[Tim Berners-Lee]]. The UK was also the world's first country to introduce regular public radio and television services, and introduced the world's first fully-functioning civil and military [[radar]] network and public railway transport system.

===Literature===
{{main|British literature}}
[[Image:Shakespeare.jpg|thumb|230px|The [[Chandos portrait]], believed to depict the famed [[playwright]] [[William Shakespeare]].]]
The countries that make up the United Kingdom have provided some of the world's most notable and popular authors, poets and literary figures. The English playwright and poet [[William Shakespeare]] is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the [[English language]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9109536 |title=Encyclopedia Britannica article on Shakespeare |accessdate=2006-02-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761562101/Shakespeare.html |title=MSN Encarta Encyclopedia article on Shakespeare |accessdate=2006-02-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://columbia.thefreedictionary.com/Shakespeare,+William |title=Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia article on Shakespeare |accessdate=2006-02-26}}</ref>

In the history of the [[novel]] England is particularly well represented. Early English writers included [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], [[Thomas Malory]] and [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]. In the 17th century, [[Samuel Richardson]] (often credited with inventing the modern novel), and subsequently [[Henry Fielding]], [[Laurence Sterne]], [[Walter Scott]], and [[Jane Austen]] all innovated in the novel form, followed by [[William Makepeace Thackeray|Thackeray]], the [[Brontë|Brontë sisters]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[Thomas Hardy]], [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] and [[Anthony Trollope]]. In the twentieth century, [[H. G. Wells]], [[D. H. Lawrence]], the [[Modernists]] [[Virginia Woolf]] and [[Henry Green]], [[E. M. Forster]], [[George Orwell]] and [[Graham Greene]] were prominent. More recently, [[Ian McEwan]], [[Martin Amis]], [[Alan Hollinghurst]], [[Ben Okri]], [[Will Self]], [[Monica Ali]], and [[Zadie Smith]] were among those gaining recognition, while children's author [[J. K. Rowling]] has seen immense popularity, recalling that of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].

Wales and Scotland have also contributed many notable writers to the UK’s literary tradition, particularly in poetry. In the early medieval period, Welsh writers composed the [[Mabinogion]]. In modern times, the poets [[R.S. Thomas]] and [[Dylan Thomas]] have brought Welsh culture to an international audience. In Romantic literature, Scotland saw [[Sir Walter Scott]] and [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s epic adventures and the leading poet of his day, [[Robert Burns]]. Modern Scottish writers like [[Hugh MacDiarmid]] and [[Neil M. Gunn]] helped develop a distinct modernist and nationalist Scottish voice, sometimes termed the [[Scottish Renaissance]]. A more grim outlook is found in [[Ian Rankin]]'s stories and the psychological horror-comedy of [[Iain Banks]].  Other notable authors from Scotland include [[Muriel Spark]], [[Alasdair Gray]], [[Alan Warner]], and [[Irvine Welsh]].

Many authors from other nationalities, particularly the Irish, and from [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, have also lived and worked in the UK. Significant examples through the centuries include [[Jonathon Swift]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Bram Stoker]], [[George Bernard Shaw]] and [[Joseph Conrad]], and more recently British authors of overseas origin such as [[Kazuo Ishiguro]] and [[Salman Rushdie]].

Significant [[British poetry|British poets]] include [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], [[John Milton]], [[John Donne]], [[George Herbert]], [[Andrew Marvell]], [[Alexander Pope]], [[William Blake]], [[William Wordsworth]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[John Keats]], [[Robert Browning]],[[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Lord Tennyson]],  [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Wilfred Owen]], [[John Betjeman]], [[Philip Larkin]], [[W. H. Auden]] and [[Ted Hughes]].

The history of the [[theatre]] in the United Kingdom is particularly vivid. Shakespeare's contemporaries [[Christopher Marlowe]] and [[Ben Jonson]] add depth to the early theatre. More recently [[Alan Ayckbourn]], [[Harold Pinter]], [[Michael Frayn]], [[Tom Stoppard]] and [[David Edgar (playwright)|David Edgar]] have combined elements of surrealism, realism and radicalism; with successful recent playwrights also including [[John Osborne]], [[Arnold Wesker]], [[Alan Bennett]] and [[David Hare]].

===Philosophy===
[[Image:David Hume.jpg|thumb|right|140px|[[David Hume]] (1711-1776).]]
The United Kingdom has produced many of the world's most eminent philosophers. Among them are such figures as [[William of Ockham]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]], [[David Hume]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and [[Alfred Ayer]]. The United Kingdom has, moreover, been home to many influential and leading philosophers born in other countries, such as [[Isaiah Berlin]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Karl Marx]].

===Engineering and innovation===
{{seealso|Category:British inventors|Category:British inventions}}
As birthplace of the [[Industrial Revolution]], the UK was home to many significant inventors during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century. Famous British engineers include [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], who was best known for the creation of the [[Great Western Railway]], a series of famous [[steamship]]s, and numerous important [[bridge]]s. As well as [[Richard Trevithick]] and [[George Stephenson]] who were both pioneers of locomotives.

Recent British inventors include [[James Dyson]], inventor of the [[DC01|Dual Cyclone]] bagless [[vacuum cleaner]].

As above, notable engineering firsts include the [[steam locomotive]] and the modern railway, [[television]], [[electric lighting]], the [[electric motor]], the [[screw propeller]], the [[internal combustion engine]], the [[jet engine]] and the first programmable [[computer]] ([[Colossus computer|Colossus]]). Two notable innovations are the [[vaccination]] and [[antibiotics]].
<!--Other notable figures in the fields of engineering and innovation include:
*[[Tim Berners-Lee]] (inventor of the [[world wide web]])
*[[James Blundell (physician)|James Blundell]] (performed the first [[blood transfusion]])
*[[Frank Whittle]] (inventor of the [[jet engine]])
*[[E. Purnell Hooley]] (Inventor of [[tarmacadam|tarmac)]]
*[[Edwin Beard Budding]] (Inventor of the [[lawnmower]])
*[[Stephen Perry]] (inventor of the [[rubber band]])
*[[Thomas Fowler]] (inventor of the [[thermosiphon]])
*[[Richard Trevithick]] (builder of the earliest steam [[locomotive]])
*[[Joseph Swan]] (developer of the [[light bulb]])
*[[George Cayley]] (inventor of the [[seat belt]])-->

===Cinema===
{{main|Cinema of the United Kingdom}}
The United Kingdom has been influential in the development of cinema, with the [[Ealing Studios]] claiming to be the oldest studios in the world. Despite a history of important and successful productions, the industry is characterised by an ongoing debate about its identity, and the influences of American and European cinema. Famous films include the [[Harry Potter]], [[Star Wars]] and [[James Bond]] series which, although made by American studios, used British source materials, locations, actors and filming crew.

===Music===
{{main|British Music}}
Notable composers from the United Kingdom have included [[William Byrd]], [[Henry Purcell]], [[Sir Edward Elgar]], [[Sir Arthur Sullivan]] (most famous for working with librettist [[Sir W. S. Gilbert]]), [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], and [[Benjamin Britten]], pioneer of modern British [[opera]]. London remains one of the major [[classical music]] capitals of the world.

The {{abbr|UK}} was, with the US, one of the two main contributors to the development of [[rock music]], and the {{abbr|UK}} has provided some of the world's most famous rock bands including [[The Beatles]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Queen]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Black Sabbath]], [[The Kinks]], [[The Who]], [[Depeche Mode]] and [[Radiohead]].

The {{abbr|UK}} has also been at the forefront of a succession of developments of rock, such as punk rock (produced by bands such as [[The Sex Pistols]] and [[The Clash]]), Goth, [[Techno]] and [[house music]], folk rock, heavy metal, and progressive rock. The late-1970s and early-1980s saw the rise of [[Post-Punk]] and [[New Wave music|New Wave]]. The so-called 'Second British Invasion' into the US popular music scene took place from 1981 to 1984 when {{abbr|UK}} bands such as [[Duran Duran]], [[Culture Club]] and [[Human League]] flooded the US Billboard charts. In the mid to late-1990s, the [[Britpop]] phenomenon saw bands such as [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[Blur (band)|Blur]] and [[Suede (band)|Suede]] attain considerable national and international success. The 1990s also saw the rise of successful Welsh bands such as the [[Manic Street Preachers]], [[The Stereophonics]], [[Catatonia]] and [[Super Furry Animals]]. 

The {{abbr|UK}} has also played a large part in promoting [[electronica]] in popular music, with British artists such as [[Underworld]], [[The Prodigy]], [[The Chemical Brothers]] and [[Faithless]] helping this mainly underground genre to cross over into the mainstream, having first reached a wider audience in the late-1980's and early-1990s with bands such as [[808 State]],  [[Orbital (band)|Orbital]], [[The Orb]], [[Happy Mondays]] and [[The KLF]]. 

During the 1990s and 2000s artists in [[Urban contemporary|urban]] music in Britain spawned first [[drum and bass]], [[trip-hop]] and towards the end of the first decade [[UK garage]], through acts such as the [[Artful Dodger]]. The popularity of "stadium rock" bands such as [[Coldplay]], [[Snow Patrol]], [[Travis]], [[Embrace (UK band)|Embrace]], [[Muse (band)|Muse]], and [[Keane]] increased, whilst [[Indie (music)|indie music]] has grown in profile, with bands including [[The Libertines]], [[Arctic Monkeys]], [[Bloc Party]], [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]], [[Kaiser Chiefs]] and [[Hard-Fi]] enjoying chart success. UK urban music has grown more popular with acts such as [[Jamelia]]. The UK also has a number of extremely successful girl bands, most notably [[The Spice Girls]], as well as [[Girls Aloud]] and [[Sugababes]].

===Visual art===
The [[Royal Academy]] is located in London. Other major schools of art include the [[Slade School of Art]]; the six-school [[University of the Arts, London]], which includes the [[Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design]] and [[Chelsea College of Art and Design]]; the [[Glasgow School of Art]], and [[Goldsmiths, University of London]]. This commercial venture is one of Britain's foremost visual arts organisations.  Major British artists include [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]], [[Thomas Gainsborough]], [[John Constable]], [[William Blake]], [[J. M. W. Turner]], [[William Morris]], [[Francis Bacon]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[David Hockney]], [[Gilbert and George]], [[Richard Hamilton]], [[Peter Blake]], [[Howard Hodgkin]], [[Antony Gormley]], and [[Anish Kapoor]].  During the late 1980s and 1990s, the [[Saatchi Gallery]] in London brought to public attention a group of multigenre artists who would become known as the [[Young British Artists]].  [[Damian Hirst]], [[Chris Ofili]], [[Rachel Whiteread]], [[Tracy Emin]], [[Mark Wallinger]], [[Steve McQueen (artist)|Steve McQueen]], [[Sam Taylor-Wood]], and the [[Chapman Brothers]] are among the better known members of this loosely affiliated movement.

===Media===
{{main|Media of the United Kingdom}}
The UK has a virtually unrivalled number of media outlets, and the prominence of the English language gives it a widespread international dimension.

====Broadcasting====
The [[BBC]] is the {{abbr|UK}}'s publicly funded [[radio]] and [[television]] broadcasting corporation, and is the oldest and largest broadcaster in the world. Funded by the [[television licence]], a legal requirement for any British household with a television receiver - even if they do not watch BBC channels, the BBC operates several [[BBC Television|television networks]] and [[BBC Radio|radio]] stations both in the {{abbr|UK}} and abroad. The BBC's international television news service, [[BBC World]], is broadcast throughout the world and the [[BBC World Service]] radio network is broadcast in thirty-three languages globally. 
In the UK, the TV licence is free for people over 75 and owning a radio does not need a licence.

There are five major nationwide television networks in the {{abbr|UK}}: [[BBC One]], [[BBC Two]], [[ITV1]], [[Channel 4]] and [[Five (channel)|Five]] - all currently transmitted by analogue terrestrial, free-to-air signals with the latter three networks funded by commercial advertising.

The UK now also has a large number of digital terrestrial channels including a further six from the BBC, five from ITV and three from Channel 4 among a variety of others.

The vast majority of digital [[Cable television|cable]] services are provided by [[Virgin Media]] with [[Satellite television|satellite]] being provided by [[BSkyB]] and [[free-to-air]] digital terrestrial television by [[Freeview]]. The entire country [[Digital switchover in the United Kingdom|will switch to digital]] by 2012.

[[Radio in the United Kingdom|Radio in the {{abbr|UK}}]] is dominated by [[BBC Radio]], which operates ten national networks and over forty local radio stations. The most popular radio station, by number of listeners, is [[BBC Radio 2]], closely followed by [[BBC Radio 1]]. There are also many hundreds of mainly local commercial radio stations across the country offering a variety of music or talk formats.

====Print====
Traditionally, [[List of newspapers in the United Kingdom|British newspapers]] could be split into "quality", serious-minded newspaper (usually referred to as "[[broadsheets]]" due to their large size) and the more populist, [[tabloid]] varieties. For convenience of reading, many traditional broadsheets have switched to a more [[Compact (newspaper)|compact]]-sized format, traditionally used by [[tabloid]]s. [[The Sun (newspaper)|''The Sun'']] has the highest circulation of any daily newspaper in the {{abbr|UK}}, with approximately a quarter of the market; its sister paper, ''[[The News of The World]]'' similarly leads the Sunday newspaper market,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/section/0,,1782,00.html |title=ABC Newspaper Circulation Figures |publisher=The Times |date=[[2006-05-12]] |accessdate=2006-05-16}}</ref> and traditionally focuses on celebrity-led stories. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', a [[Right-wing politics|right-of-centre]] paper, has overtaken ''[[The Times]]'' as the highest-selling of the "quality" newspapers (former broadsheets).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.org.uk/ 
|title=Audit Bureau of Circulation Interactive Analysis National Newspaper Selection - Average Net Circulation ({{abbr|UK}}) 03-Jul-2006 to 30-Jul-2006 | accessdate=2006-09-04}} Lists the circulation of ''Daily Telegraph'' as 844,929 and ''The Times'' as 620,456.</ref> ''[[The Guardian]]'' is a more [[Liberalism in the United Kingdom|liberal]] (centre to left-wing) "quality". The ''[[Financial Times]]'' is the main business paper, printed on distinctive salmon-pink broadsheet paper. Scotland has a distinct tradition of newspaper readership (see [[List of newspapers in Scotland]]).
First printed in 1737, the [[The News Letter|Belfast News Letter]] is the oldest known English-speaking daily newspaper still in publication today. One of its fellow Northern Irish competitors, The [[Irish News]], has been twice ranked (2006, 2007) as the best regional newspaper in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newspaperawards.co.uk/default.htm |title=The Newspaper Awards |accessdate=2007-05-19}}</ref>

===Sport===
{{main|Sport in the United Kingdom}}
[[Image:Wimbledon Grojean 2004 RJL.JPG |thumb|250px|The [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] Championships, a [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournament, is held in [[Wimbledon, London]] every July.]]
A number of major [[sport]]s originated in the United Kingdom, including [[association football|football]], [[rugby football|rugby]], [[cricket]] and [[golf]].

The most popular sport in the {{abbr|UK}} is football. The {{abbr|UK}} does not compete as a nation in any major football tournament. Instead, the home nations compete individually as [[England national football team|England]], [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], [[Wales national football team|Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]]. This is due to historical reasons and a level of disassociation with the other nations by fans{{Fact|date=April 2007}}. It is because of this four-team arrangement that the {{abbr|UK}} does not compete in football events at the [[Olympic Games]]. However, there are proposals for a united team taking part in the [[2012 Summer Olympic Games]], which are to be held in London. The [[The Football Association|English]] and [[Irish Football Association|Northern Irish]] football associations have confirmed participation in this team while the [[Scottish FA]] and the [[Welsh FA]] have declined to participate, fearing that it would undermine their independent status.

The {{abbr|UK}} is home to many world-renowned football clubs, such as [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in England and [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] in Scotland.  Clubs compete in [[Football in the United Kingdom|national leagues and competitions]] and some go on to compete in European competitions. British teams are generally successful in European Competitions and several have become European Cup/UEFA Champions League winners: [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] (five times), [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] (twice), [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] (twice), [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], and [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. The European Cup competition itself was brought about due to the success of another UK club, [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], against top European sides<ref>http://galeb.etf.bg.ac.yu/~mirad/archive.html EuroCups Archive</ref> in the 1950s. The [[English Premier League]] is also the most-watched football league in the world and is particularly popular in [[Asia]]: in the [[People's Republic of China]], matches attract television audiences between 100 million and 360 million, more than any other foreign sport.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.footy-live.com/Premiership.html |title=Footy Live |publisher=Live Sport Network |accessdate=2007-04-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3207829.stm |title=Chinese phone maker's fancy footwork |publisher=BBC News |date=[[27 October]] [[2003]] |accessdate=2006-08-09}}</ref>. Also notable are [[Hibernian FC]] of [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]] who were the first British club to participate in European Football.

[[Image:Wembley stadium040307.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The new [[Wembley Stadium]] is the most expensive stadium ever built costing £793 million ($1.6 billion).]]
The 90,000 capacity [[Wembley Stadium]] is the main sporting stadium of the UK. Between the demolition of the former 'twin towers' stadium and construction of the new one (completed in March 2007), Cardiff's 73,000 seater [[Millennium Stadium]] served in this role. However, Wembley may yet be surpassed as the nation's largest stadium if [[Manchester United]]'s [[Old Trafford (football ground)|Old Trafford]] stadium undergoes further redevelopment to a possible 91,500 capacity.

The early reference to the separate national identities in the UK is perhaps best illustrated by the game of cricket. [[Cricket]] was invented in [[England]]. There are league championships but the [[England|English]] national team dominates the game in Britain. There is no UK team. Some [[Sport in Wales|Welsh]] and [[Cricket in Scotland|Scottish]] players have played for [[England]] because neither Scotland nor Ireland have Test status and only play in One Day Internationals.

The {{abbr|UK}} has proved successful in the international sporting arena in [[rowing (sport)|rowing]]. It is widely considered that the sport's most successful rower is [[Steven Redgrave]] who won five gold medals and one bronze medal at five consecutive [[Olympic Games]] as well as numerous wins at the [[World Rowing Championships]] and [[Henley Royal Regatta]].

Both forms of rugby are national sports. [[Rugby league]] originates from and is generally played in the North of England, whilst [[Rugby Union]] is played predominantly in [[Wales]], [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]], and [[Southern England]]. Having supposedly originated from the actions of [[William Webb Ellis]] at the town of [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]], it is considered the national sport of Wales. In [[rugby league]] the {{abbr|UK}} plays as one nation &ndash; [[Great Britain national rugby league team|Great Britain]] &ndash; though in union it is represented by four nations: England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland (which consists of players from the [[Republic of Ireland]] and Northern Ireland). [[England national rugby union team|England]] is the holder of the [[Rugby World Cup]]. Every four years the [[British and Irish Lions]] tour either Australia, New Zealand or South Africa. Here, rugby football differs internationally to association football, as the England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland (including the [[Republic of Ireland]]) teams combine to form the [[British and Irish Lions]] (essentially a British Isles team) although they compete separately in all other international competitions.

The [[Wimbledon Championships]] are international [[tennis]] events held in [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]] in south London every summer and are regarded as the most prestigious of the tennis calendar.

[[Thoroughbred racing]] is also very popular throughout the UK. It originated under [[Charles II of England]] as the "Sport of Kings" and is a royal pastime to this day. World-famous horse races include the [[Grand National]], the [[Epsom Derby]] and [[Royal Ascot]].

[[Image:Royal & Ancient Clubhouse.jpg|thumb|250px|[[The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews]], generally regarded as the world's "Home of Golf".]]
Golf is one of the most popular participation sports played in the {{abbr|UK}}, with [[St Andrews]] in Scotland being the sport's home course. Cricket is also popular, although the popularity of the game is dramatically greater in England than in other parts of the {{abbr|UK}}, all four constituent nations [[as of 2006]] compete at the One-Day International level &ndash; Scotland independently, Wales as part of the English team, and Northern Ireland as part of all-Ireland.

[[Shinty|Shinty (or ''camanachd'')]] (a sport derived from the same root as the [[Ireland|Irish]] [[hurling]] and similar to [[bandy]]) is popular in the [[Scottish Highlands]], sometimes attracting crowds numbering thousands in the most sparsely populated region of the {{abbr|UK}}.

The country is closely associated with [[motorsport]]. Many teams and drivers in [[Formula One]] (F1) are based in the {{abbr|UK}} and drivers from Britain have won more world titles than any other country. The country also hosts legs of the F1 and [[World Rally Championship]] and has its own [[Touring Car Racing]] championship, the [[BTCC]].
The [[British Grand Prix]] takes place at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] each July.

* The [[flag of the United Kingdom]] is the [[Union Flag]] commonly known as the "Union Jack", though this is technically only correct when flown from a Jack Mast at sea. Some people dispute this and claim that the name originated from [[King James VI]] who designed the first Union Flag, hence the name "Union Jack" or Jac's Union, Jac being short for Jacobean, a Latinised name commonly used when speaking of the King. Created from the superimposition of the flags of [[Flag of England|England]] ([[St George's Cross]]) and [[Flag of Scotland|Scotland]] ([[Saint Andrew's Cross]]), with the [[Saint Patrick's cross]], representing Ireland, being added to this in 1801.

* The [[national anthem]] of the United Kingdom is ''[[God Save the King]]'', with "King" replaced with "Queen" whenever the Monarch is female. The anthem's name, however, remains ''God Save the King''.<ref>It is sometimes asserted by those used to a legislative tradition that ''God Save the Queen'' is not the actual national anthem of the United Kingdom &ndash; or sometimes that it is the ''de facto'' national anthem &ndash; because no law has ever been passed to say that that is the case. In the United Kingdom, however, such laws are unnecessary; custom, practice and proclamation are sufficient to establish it as the official national anthem.</ref> 

[[Image:Proof-gold-britannia.jpg|thumb|250px|Britannia, featured on [[Royal Mint]] gold bullion coin]]
* [[Britannia]] is a [[National personification|personification]] of the United Kingdom, originating from the [[Roman occupation of Britannia|Roman occupation]] of southern and central Great Britain.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.24carat.co.uk/britanniaframe.html |title=Britannia on British Coins |publisher=Chard |accessdate=2006-06-25}}</ref> Britannia is symbolised as a young woman with brown or [[golden]] hair, wearing a [[Corinthian helmet]] and white robes. She holds [[Poseidon]]'s three-pronged trident and a [[shield]], bearing the Union Flag. Sometimes she is depicted as riding the back of a lion. At and since the height of the British Empire, Britannia has often associated with maritime dominance, as in the patriotic song ''[[Rule Britannia]]''.

* The [[lion]] has also been used as a symbol of the United Kingdom; one is depicted behind Britannia on the [[50p|50 pence]] piece and one is shown crowned on the back of the [[10p|10 pence]] piece. It is also used as a symbol on the non-ceremonial flag of the [[British Army]]. Lions have been used as [[heraldic device]]s many times, including in the royal arms of both the kingdoms of [[Coat of Arms of England|England]], [[Royal coat of arms of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of Gwynedd]] in [[Wales]]. The lion is featured on the emblem of the [[England national football team]], giving rise to the popular football anthem ''[[Three Lions]]'', and the [[England national cricket team]].

* The [[bulldog]] is sometimes used as a symbol of [[Great Britain]], and is often associated with [[Winston Churchill]]'s defiance of Nazi Germany.

* Britain (especially England) is also personified as the character [[John Bull]].

* The ancient British landscape, and especially some of its distinctive fauna such as the [[oak]] tree and the [[rose]], have long been a widely used proxy for the visual representation of British identity. The red rose is the emblem of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], the [[England national rugby union team]] and the [[RFU]].
