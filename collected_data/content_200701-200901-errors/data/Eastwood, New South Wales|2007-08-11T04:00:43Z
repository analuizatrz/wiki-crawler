'''Eastwood''' is a large suburb in the north of [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. It is located around 15 kilometres north-west of the [[Central Business District]].

Originally thought to have been inhabited by the Wallumedegal [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] tribe, who lived in the area between the [[Lane Cove River|Lane Cove]] and [[Parramatta River|Parramatta]] Rivers, the area was first settled by Europeans shortly after the arrival of the [[First Fleet]] in 1788, from land grants to marines and N.S.W. Corps, and was named "Eastwood" by an early Irish free settler, William Rutledge. Today it is a large urban centre in the north of Sydney of over 14000 people, with  a large shopping area. Over the past few decades Eastwood has become increasingly multicultural;<ref>Megalogenis, George, "Asian influence spices up contest", [[The Australian|''The Australian'']], [[27 February]], [[2007]], p. 11.

==Geography==
Eastwood is located at the edge of the [[Hornsby Plateau]], and its southern and western sides, the suburbs of [[Dundas Valley, New South Wales|Dundas Valley]] and [[Denistone, New South Wales|Denistone]], the land falls away down to the [[Cumberland Plain]]. To the north, Eastwood is bounded by the transport hub of [[Epping, New South Wales|Epping]] and to its east [[Marsfield, New South Wales|Marsfield]], with which Eastwood shares the same postcode (2122). The suburb is split between two local council areas, being located mostly within the [[City of Ryde]], and partially within the [[City of Parramatta]], so is split between the [[Lower North Shore (Sydney)|Lower North Shore]] and the [[Hills District (Sydney)|Hills District]] areas. 

The suburb is predominantly housing, but the main shopping area of Eastwood is centred between Rowe St and Rutledge St and divided by the railway line.

==Transport==
[[Image:Eastwoodstationsyd.JPG|thumb|right|Eastwood Station prior to its 2007 reconstruction.]]
Eastwood is relatively well served by public transport. [[Eastwood railway station, Sydney|Eastwood Railway Station]] is located on the [[Northern railway line, Sydney|Northern Line]]. The station opened in 1886,<ref>Bozier, Rolfe, ''[http://www.nswrail.net/locations/show.php?name=NSW:Eastwood "New South Wales Railways: Eastwood Railway Station"]''. Accessed [[4 July]], [[2006]].</ref> and journeys take approximately 35 minutes to the CBD. Intercity services also depart the station for the city of [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] and the [[Central Coast, New South Wales|Central Coast]] region.

Numerous bus services also operate from the small interchange outside the station. These include the 545 route between [[Parramatta, New South Wales|Parramatta]] and [[Chatswood, New South Wales|Chatswood]], the 544 route between [[Auburn, New South Wales|Auburn]] and [[Macquarie University]], and the 515/X15 service to the [[Sydney CBD]]. Eastwood is also served well by roads, and is located close to the trunk routes of [[Metroad 6]] (Marsden Road), and [[Victoria Road, Sydney|Victoria Road]].

==History==
[[Image:Eastwoodbrickworks.JPG|right|thumb|The old Eastwood Brickworks site, now being developed into a housing estate.]]
The area of Eastwood was originally granted between the years of 1790 and 1803. In 1835, William Rutledge purchase the area and gave it the name of Eastwood Estate. In 1863 Edward Terry purchased the estate. Upon Edward Terry's death in 1905, the estate was sub-divided into what is now the Eastwood village and area.
The name derives from the name of the Terry family residence, so called after [[Eastwood, Nottinghamshire]], [[England]].
Eastwood is home to the [[Granny Smith]] [[apple]] variety. This is celebrated each October with the ''[[Granny Smith Festival]]'' which attracts over 60,000 people each year.

The shopping area underwent a major upgrade in the early 1980s. Rowe St, which originally ran across the railway line through a [[level crossing]] was turned into a mall between The Avenue and West Parade, and the 1940s bridge built in First Avenue for crossing traffic was replaced with a six-lane bridge. This bridge was to service the planned County of Cumberland Scheme "County Road" (linking Eastwood with [[Macquarie Park]]), a road project in the local area which has been controversial among locals.<ref>Laybutt, Sam, ''[http://www.ozroads.com.au/NSW/Special/Unbuilt/Eastwood/eastwoodcountyroad.htm "Ozroads: Eastwood County Road"]'', [[2004]]-[[2007]].

Eastwood was the scene of the murder of Sydney taxi driver Robert Woodger in June 2007.<ref>[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], ''[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/06/24/1960037.htm "Student charged with taxi driver's murder"]'', [[24 June]], [[2007]].

==Land Use==
Eastwood's commercial district is becoming well known as an Asian shopping precinct, with specialty stores, supermarkets and many restaurants run by Chinese, Korean, Sri Lankan and Indian retailers.<ref>Maher, Stephen, "Goodbye to the Eastwood of old", ''Northern District Times'', [[11 April]], [[2007]], p. 14. Accessed via [[Factiva]] on [[10 July]], [[2007]].</ref> The Eastwood Shopping Centre, which includes major retailer [[Woolworths (supermarkets)|Woolworths]], is located in the town centre and opens on to the Eastwood Plaza. The Plaza features a fountain and several cafes with outdoor seating.

While most of Eastwood is residential, with one or two-storey buildings and villas, the area surrounding the town centre boasts buildings up to seven storeys high. In 2006 the City of Ryde developed a Control Plan for the Eastwood Town Centre, which includes the provision of buildings of up to ten storeys high in the shopping and railway areas.<ref>[[City of Ryde]], [http://www.ryde.nsw.gov.au/WEB/SITE/RESOURCES/DOCUMENTS/Planning/4.1_dcp06.pdf "Development Control Plan - Part 4.1 Eastwood Town Centre"], [[2006]], pp. 11â€“12. Accessed [[4 July]], [[2007]].</ref> Former industrial parts of the suburb are also undergoing redevelopment. The former brickworks site is being converted into a housing estate.<ref>Rumble, Chantal, "Brick pit fill bakes anger", ''Northern District Times'', [[21 May]], [[2003]], p. 2.</ref><ref>''[http://www.newthorpe.com.au/life_at_newthorpe/default.asp "Life at Newthorpe"]''.

Eastwood used to have a lake which gave the names Lakeside Road and The Lakeside Road Uniting Church.<ref>Giuliani, Bernard, (1988) ''Eastwood Scrapbook'', p.1? Marist Publishers: Drummoyne, NSW.
