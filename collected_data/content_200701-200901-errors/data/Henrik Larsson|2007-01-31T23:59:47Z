'''Henrik Edward Larsson''' [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] [IPA: {{IPA|'hɛnrɪk 'lɑːʂɔn}}] (born [[September 20]], [[1971]] in [[Helsingborg]], [[Skåne]], [[Sweden]]) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[football (soccer)|football]] player, in part of [[Cape Verde|Cape-Verdian]] descent. 

Before making a name for himself on the international stage in the mid-1990s, a young Henrik Larsson was most famous for his high-flying long, golden brown dreadlocks which were tied back with his trademark white headband.  After fully recovering from a career-threatening injury in 1999, Larsson returned to the game with his head completely shaven.  He has not grown his hair back since. 

Larsson is best known for his seven very successful years with [[Scotland|Scottish]] club [[Celtic F.C.]]. He subsequently had a two-year spell at [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] of [[Spain]], where he won the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]. Having left Barcelona in the summer of 2006, he returned to his hometown club of [[Helsingborgs IF]]. 

On [[December 1]], [[2006]], it was announced that Larsson would sign for [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on loan from [[January 2]] until [[March 12]] [[2007]], coinciding with the Swedish football league's winter break. He will then return to [[Helsingborgs IF]] in time for the start of the Swedish league season in April <ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/6198464.stm |title=Man Utd capture Larsson on loan |accessdate=2006-12-01 | date=[[1 December]] [[2006]] |year=2006 |month=12 |publisher=BBC }}</ref> (although there is talk of Manchester United extending the loan period to the end of the English season in May). He scored in his debut game on 7 January, a third round [[FA Cup]] win against [[Aston Villa]].

From 1993-2002 and 2004-2006 Larsson played international football for [[Swedish national football team|Sweden]]. He announced his international retirement after the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]]. As of the 9th of January 2007 it was reported that Sweden boss Lars Lagerback has held talks with Henrik Larsson and is understood to be trying to lure him out of international retirement. Lagerback is quoted as saying that the Swedish FA are eager to see him playing for his country once more. 


==Biography==
Larsson started his professional career playing for [[Högaborgs BK|Högaborg]] at the age of 17. He subsequently moved to [[Helsingborgs IF]], where he scored 50 goals in 56 appearances. It was this sensational form that attracted the interest of [[The Netherlands|Dutch]] club [[Feyenoord Rotterdam|Feyenoord]], who signed him for [[Pound sterling|£]]295,000 in 1993. This was despite the fact he was negotiating a contract with [[Grasshopper-Club Zürich]] at the time.{{fact}}

Following a complicated contract dispute with Feyenoord, he was signed by Celtic manager [[Wim Jansen]] in July 1997 for a fee of £650,000. His debut against [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] at [[Easter Road]] was less than spectacular: he inadvertently passed the ball to Hibs player, [[Chic Charnley]], resulting in a 2-1 loss for Celtic. He did not fare much better in his first European game, scoring an own goal, although Celtic did run out 6-3 winners.

Larsson scored 242 goals for Celtic, in 315 matches, making him Celtic's third all-time record goal scorer (in all competitions). This is more remarkable in the fact that he missed almost a year having suffered a horrific injury, breaking his leg in two places, whilst playing against [[Olympique Lyonnais]] in a UEFA cup match in France.

In 2001 he won the "[[European Golden Boot|Golden Boot]]" award for being Europe's most prolific goal scorer, with 30 league goals. His total in all competitions that season was 53. In 2003, he scored two superb goals in the UEFA Cup Final, although opponents Porto went on to win [[UEFA Cup 2002-03#Final|3-2]]. His goalscoring feats on the continent for Celtic mean he holds the record for number of goals scored for a club from the British Isles in European matches. Celtic fans voted him the only foreigner in the greatest ever Celtic team.   <ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/celtic/2245965.stm</ref>

In his last appearance for Celtic, he scored twice to defeat Dunfermline Athletic and win the Scottish Cup. He gave a teary goodbye at his [[testimonial match]] against [[Sevilla FC]].

==Winning the European Cup with Barcelona==

At the end of the 2003-04 season Larsson signed a one year contract with [[F.C. Barcelona|Barcelona]] with an option for a second year.

Larsson's first season at Barcelona was plagued by injury, and he played only a nominal part in Barça's [[La Liga]] win. He did, however, score against Celtic in a [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] match. After the game he said "It was very difficult for me to celebrate my goal because I had so many great times here...".<ref>Graham Clark, [http://football.guardian.co.uk/Match_Report/0,1527,1304856,00.html Larsson's return is unhappy for Celtic], [[Guardian Unlimited]], September 15, 2004</ref> Despite having missed most of the 2004-05 season, Barcelona took the option to extend his contract. In 2005-06 Larsson scored 10 goals as Barcelona won La Liga for a second consecutive year.
 
In January 2006, Larsson announced that at the end of his contract, which ended in July, he would leave Barcelona and return to Sweden to end his career. He revealed that he had politely refused a verbal promise by club president [[Joan Laporta]] to extend his contract to the end of the next season. News of his departure provoked praise from his teamates, including Ronaldinho - "With Henrik leaving us at the end of the season this club is losing a great scorer, no question. But I am also losing a great friend. Henrik was my idol and now that I am playing next to him it is fantastic."<ref>David Mccarthy, [http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/tm_objectid=16993621&method=full&siteid=66633&headline=ronnie--barca-pal-larsson-is-my-idol-name_page.html RONNIE: BARCA PAL LARSSON IS MY IDOL], ''DailyRecord'', April 26, 2006</ref>

In his final game for Barcelona, he won his first UEFA Champions League medal. Larsson came on as a substitute and assisted both of Barcelona's goals in a 2-1 win over [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. [[Thierry Henry]] paid tribute to Larsson's contribution to Barcelona's win after the game, saying "People always talk about Ronaldinho, Eto'o, Giuly and everything but I didn't see them today - I saw Henrik Larsson. Two times he came on - he changed the game, that is what killed the game - sometimes you talk about Ronaldinho and Eto'o and people like that, you need to talk about the proper footballer who made the difference and that was Henrik Larsson tonight..."<ref>{{cite web| last = Bailey| first = Graeme| url = http://home.skysports.com/list.asp?hlid=388106&CPID=5&clid=3&lid=4161&title=Henry+questions+referee| title = Henry questions referee|}} </ref>
Indeed his ability to give Barcelona the cutting edge required to overcome Arsenal was noted by the international press: <ref>Jon Brodkin, [http://football.guardian.co.uk/championsleague200506/story/0,,1777338,00.html Larsson takes his leave in the grandest style], [[Guardian Unlimited]], May 18, 2006</ref><ref>Simon Baskett, [http://in.rediff.com/sports/2006/may/18champs1.htm Barca inherit 'dream team' mantle], [[Reuters]], May 18, 2006</ref>

It was created with a flick of Henrik Larsson's right foot, a moment born of experience and craft. Larsson has said he is retiring from this level of soccer after this game. He had only just come on the field as a replacement but he knew exactly what he was doing. He has vision. He is 34 and he has been in the game for the whole of his adult life and what he could do once he could repeat another four minutes and Larsson again showed the ability to find the pass that destroys defenses. This time he spotted Juliano Belletti, another replacement, who with almost his first touch of the night powered the ball inside the near post of Arsenal's replacement goalkeeper, Manuel Almunia

However, Larsson, a free transfer among an array of multi-million pound talent, was undoubtedly the difference between the sides. He set up the equalising goal with a delicate sidefooted pass to Samuel Eto'o, who took two touches before dinking the ball past Manuel Almunia..
Rijkaard hailed Larsson's role in the victory but said there was no chance of the Swede staying at Camp Nou for one more season. Larsson signed for Barcelona from Celtic in July, 2004.
"He is a wonderful player, and a very important player for us," said Rijkaard later. "He is always ready and prepared to come on and really help the team when we need him.
"We spoke to Henrik [about staying at Barcelona] but he has made his decision. He says now is the right time for him to go back home to Sweden."
Larsson preferred to concentrate on the effort shown by his team-mates.
"It was a tough match and the whole team deserve credit for the win," he said. "It was an unbelievable way for me to finish my career at Barcelona. I have had a fantastic experience here in my two years, with two league titles and now this. It's amazing."

After Sweden's elimination from the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] on [[June 24]] [[2006]], Larsson joined up with his former club, [[Helsingborgs IF]]. He made his second debut for his hometown club against [[Hammarby IF|Hammarby]] in the [[Svenska Cupen|Swedish Cup]] on [[July 6]], [[2006]]. 

==Later days at Manchester United==
 
After a short stint in Helsingborg, Larsson was signed on loan by [[Sir Alex Ferguson]]'s [[Manchester United]]. United announced that Larsson would be on loan from [[January 2]] until [[March 12]], which coincides with the Swedish league's off season. He scored on his debut for Manchester United against Aston Villa in the [[FA Cup]] Third Round on [[January 7]], [[2007]] at [[Old Trafford (football ground)|Old Trafford]].

It had been reported that Larsson might be allowed to stay with United until the end of the English season if all parties involved agreed on a settlement.<ref>[http://home.skysports.com/list.aspx?hlid=439993&plid=2193&clid=1&cpid=8 Larsson could stay at United], skysports.com, [[January 8]], [[2007]]</ref>. Larsson had admitted that he would consider staying at United until the end of the season, however the club changed their stance by insisting he must return on the arranged date.<ref>[http://home.skysports.com/list.aspx?hlid=443000&plid=2193&clid=1&cpid=8 Larsson eyes United stay], skysports.com, [[January 21]], [[2007]]</ref>

Larsson scored his first ever [[FA Premier League|Premiership]] goal on [[January 31]] [[2007]] in a 4-0 win over [[Watford F.C.|Watford]].

==International career==
Larsson's international record is impressive with 36 goals in 93 games, many of which he played in midfield or as a winger. He has always made his mark on big occasions and has scored at three [[Football World Cup|World Cups]] ([[Football World Cup 1994|1994]] at which Sweden came 3rd, [[Football World Cup 2002|2002]] and [[Football World Cup 2006|2006]]), and two [[European Football Championship|European Championships]] ([[2000 European Football Championship|2000]] and [[2004 European Football Championship|2004]]).

Larsson originally chose to retire from International football in [[2002]]. His decision was met with much dismay in his homeland and there was much clamouring for him to return to the team for their campaign at [[2004 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 2004]] in [[Portugal]].{{fact}} Despite initially maintaining his decision to retire, turning down overtures from [[UEFA]] President [[Lennart Johansson]] and the [[Prime Minister of Sweden|Swedish Prime Minister]] in the process,{{fact}} he eventually returned to the national side at the behest of his son, and to great effect, scoring three goals in four matches and leading Sweden to the quarter-finals, where they were defeated in a [[penalty shootout (football)|penalty shootout]] by the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch]]. Larsson's tremendous diving header against Bulgaria was voted Best Goal of the 2004 European Championships.{{fact}}

Larsson also featured at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] in [[Germany]]. He scored in the final minute of the match against England for Sweden to draw the match 2-2 in their final game in the group stages, thus becoming only the sixth player to score in World Cup finals which are 12 years apart. The goal also sealed Sweden's qualification for the second round of the tournament. But in Sweden's Round of 16 game against host Germany, he blasted a penalty over the bar which could have given his team a lifeline after trailing 2-0 for most of the match.

He retired from international football for the second time on [[July 17]], [[2006]]. "It is time to quit now. It feels right. I'm done with the national team," the 34-year-old Larsson told TV station Canal Plus.

==Personal life==
Henrik's father is from the [[Cape Verde]] Islands, off the coast of [[West Africa]], and his mother is Swedish. In 1996 he married his childhood sweetheart, Magdalena. They have two children, Jordan (born 1997) and Janelle (born 2002).
