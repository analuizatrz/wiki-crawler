==Synopsis==
{{spoiler}}
The movie opens in Phoenix, Arizona, with discreet lovers Marion Crane (Leigh) and Sam Loomis (Gavin) together in a downtown hotel room.  Until Sam's finances improve, the two cannot marry.  Unhappy and desperate to improve their situation, Marion steals $40,000 cash from a sale at the real estate office where she works.  Asked to deposit the money at the bank for the weekend, she instead packs and leaves town with the money, which she sees as the ticket to her and Sam's happiness.  

Sam lives in a California town. Marion heads there, and her behavior along the way draws the attention of others. In one scene she trades her car for another used car while a suspicious lawman watches.

While driving fatigued in the dark, in pouring rain, she sees a seemingly deserted motel. There, Marion encounters Norman Bates (Perkins), the young owner who looks after the motel and his ailing mother in the nearby house on a hill.  Unfortunately for Marion, Norman has completely understated his overbearing mother's illness. Ultimately, as Marion showers in her motel room, she is stabbed to death in the now-famous "shower scene" by a shadowy woman's figure while [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s screeching violin score plays.  [[Image:Bateshower.jpg|The shadowy mother figure from the famous shower scene.|thumb|left|275px]]Norman is horrified when he finds the bloody corpse.  To protect his mother, he disposes all evidence of the crime by sinking Marion, her car, and her belongings (including the money, which Bates has not seen) in a swamp behind the Bates' property.  Marion's disappearance, with the money, sets a search in motion. A private detective, Milton Arbogast (Balsam), is hired to find and recover the money. He traces Marion to the Bates Motel where he is similarly slashed to death after being pushed down a flight of stairs.

Sam and Marion's sister, Lila, tipped by Detective Arbogast before his demise, are also suspicious of Norman and his involvement with Marion's disappearance.  While investigating they decide to check into the Bates Motel, to search for proof of Marion, where they find one of her earrings and a paper with the sum of $40,000 written on it.  Theorizing that Norman disposed of Marion to keep the money for himself, Lila sneaks into his house while Sam confronts him at the office. Sam's heated argument with Norman quickly escalates to violence, and Norman knocks Sam unconscious and flees to the house. Meanwhile, Lila slips into the basement to discover the semi-preserved corpse of Norman's mother just as Norman enters to find her.  Cross-dressed in his mother's clothing, complete with wig, Norman is wielding the deadly butcher's knife, preparing to kill Lila.  Sam regains consciousness, reappearing just in time to wrestle the knife away from Norman and rescue Lila.

At the end of the film, a [[forensic psychiatrist]] (Oakland) explains to Lila, Sam and the authorities that Bates's mother, though dead, lives on in Norman's [[psyche]]. Norman was so dominated by his mother while she lived, and so guilt-ridden for murdering her eight years earlier, that he tried to erase the crime from his mind by bringing his mother back to life. Physically, this was done by [[exhumation|exhuming]] her corpse and preserving it with his [[taxidermy]] skills, thereby inciting a split personality in Norman, creating the [[persona]] of his mother. He acts as he believes she would, talks as she would, and even dresses as she would, in an attempt to erase her absence and the guilt. Because Norman was so very jealous of his mother while she lived, his split personality is equally jealous of any woman to whom Norman might be attracted. Norman's psychosis prohibits him from knowing of his mother's crimes or her original demise.  

The last scene shows Norman Bates in a cell, his mind now completely dominated by the persona of his mother. She blames Norman for the crimes, and plans on demonstrating to the authorities that she is utterly harmless, thinking to herself, "They’ll see and they’ll say, 'Why, she wouldn’t even hurt a fly!'" A brief epilogue shows Marion's car being towed from its watery grave, presumably to collect her body and the $40,000.

==Production==
===Pre-production===
The film is based on the novel by Robert Bloch, which was in turn based on the crimes of Wisconsin serial killer Ed Gein. Hitchcock acquired the film rights anonymously through an agent for a very small sum of $9,000.<ref name="Leigh6"> Leigh, 6</ref>

Hitchcock embraced ''Psycho'' as a means to regain success and individuality in an increasingly competitive genre. He had witnessed many B-movies churned out by [[William Castle]] and [[Roger Corman]] that cleaned up at box offices despite being panned by critics. There were also a series of competing directors who had tried their hand at typical Hitchcock fare in such films as ''When Strangers Marry'', ''The Spiral Staircase'', ''Gaslight'', and so forth.<ref>Rebello, 18</ref> Furthermore, both Hitchcock and [[Henri-Georges Clouzot]] had adapted two books by the same authors with very different results. Clouzot's ''Les Diaboliques'' was critically acclaimed and financially successful, earning him the title of the "French Hitchcock," while Hitchcock's ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' had failed both critically and financially.<ref>Rebello, 18</ref> Hitchcock was also constantly reinventing himself (he once said "Style is self-plagiarism"), so, when Peggy Robertson, a trusted production assistant, brought ''Psycho'' to his attention, he seized on it, not only for its originality but as a way to retake his mantle as an acclaimed director of suspense.<ref>Rebello, pp. 17, 19</ref>

Ned Brown, Hitchcock's longtime agent, explains that Hitchcock liked the story because the focus began with Marion's dilemma then completely turned after the murder.<ref name="Leigh23">Leigh, 23</ref> Hitchcock himself said in an interview with [[François Truffaut]] that "I think the thing that appealed to me was the suddenness of the murder in the shower, coming, as it were, out of the blue. That was about all."<ref name="Leigh23" /> 

James Cavanaugh wrote the original screenplay, but Hitchcock turned it down citing its dragging storyline that he believed read like a TV short horror story.<ref>Leigh, 36</ref> Hitchcock reluctantly agreed to meet with Joseph Stefano, who had only worked on one film prior. Despite his inexperience, the meeting went well and Stefano was hired.

The screenplay is relatively faithful to the novel, with a few notable adaptations by Hitchcock and Stefano. The book features Mary Crane, from [[Dallas, Texas]] as its heroine and protagonist. Since, at the time, a real Mary Crane existed in Phoenix, Hitchcock renamed the character Marion Crane.<ref>Leigh, 34</ref> Stefano also changed Marion's telltale earring found in the bathroom after her death to a scrap of paper in the toilet. When developing the characters for film, Hitchcock asked Stefano why he did not like the Norman Bates character, to which Stefano replied that Norman was unsympathetic, unattractive, and a drinker. Hitchcock suggested Perkins as a sympathetic man, and Stefano agreed.<ref>Leigh, 36-37</ref> Other changes Stefano made for the screenplay include the location of Arbogast's death from the foyer to the stairwell. He also changed the novel's budding romance between Sam and Lila to just a friendly relationship, and instead of using the two to explain Norman's mental condition he replaced them with a professional psychiatrist.<ref>Leigh, 39</ref>

Paramount, whose contract guaranteed another film by Hitchcock, did not want Hitchcock to make ''Psycho.'' Their official stance was that the book was "too repulsive" and "impossible for films," and nothing but another of his star-studded mystery thrillers.<ref name="Leigh6" /><ref>Rebello, 13</ref> They did not like "anything about it at all" and denied him his usual budget.<ref name="Rebello23">Rebello, 23</ref> So Hitchcock financed the film's creation through his own Shamley Productions, shooting at Universal Studios under the Revue television unit.<ref name="Rebello23"/><ref name="Leigh9697">Leigh, 96-97</ref> Hitchcock's original [[Bates Motel]] and [[Psycho House]] movie set buildings, which were constructed on the same stage as Lon Chaney's ''The Phantom of the Opera'', are still standing at [[Universal Studios]] near [[Hollywood]], California and are a regular attraction on the studio's tour - see [[WikiMapia]] {Coordinates: 34°8'12"N 118°20'48"W}.<ref>Leigh, 86, 173</ref> As a further result of cost cutting, Hitchcock chose to film ''Psycho'' in black and white, keeping the budget under $1,000,000.<ref>Rothenberg, Robert S.

Retrieved on [[2006-11-28]]</ref> Other reasons for shooting in black and white were to prevent the shower scene from being too gory and that he was a fan of ''Les Diaboliques'''s use of black and white.<ref>CBS/AP.

Retrieved on [[2006-11-28]].</ref><ref>Rebello, 82</ref> 

To keep costs down and because he was most comfortable around them, Hitchcock took most of his crew from his television series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', including the cinematographer, set designer, script supervisor, and first assistant director.<ref>Rebello, 28</ref> He hired regular collaborators Bernard Herrmann as music composer, George Tomasini as editor and Saul Bass for the title design and storyboarding of the shower scene. In all, his crew cost $62,000<ref>Leigh, 12</ref> Through the strength of his reputation, Hitchcock managed to cast Janet Leigh for a fourth of her usual fee, paying only $25,000. His first choice, she agreed after having only read the novel and without inquiry into her salary;<ref>Leigh, 33</ref> her co-star, Anthony Perkins, agreed to $40,000.<ref>Leigh, 12-13</ref> Both stars were experienced and proven box-office draws.

Paramount did distribute the film, but four years later Hitchcock sold his stock in Shamley to Universal's parent company and his next six films were made at and distributed by Universal.<ref name="Leigh9697"/> After another four years, Paramount sold all rights to Universal.<ref name="Leigh9697"/>  When the film became a major hit, the Hitchcocks received a much larger share of the profit than they would have otherwise.

===Filming===
The film, independently produced by Hitchcock, was shot at [[Revue Studios]],<ref>Hall, John W. (September 1995). [http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/14/psycho.html Touch of Psycho? Hitchcock, Welles.] ''Bright Lights Film Journal''. Retrieved on [[2006-11-26]].</ref> the same location as his television show. ''Psycho'' was shot on a tight budget of $806,947.55,<ref>Leigh, 22</ref> beginning on [[November 11]], [[1959]] and ending on [[February 1]], [[1960]].<ref>Rebello, 128</ref><ref>Leigh, 88</ref> Filming started in the morning and finished by six or earlier on Thursdays (when Hitchcock and his wife would dine at [[Chasen's]]).<ref>Leigh, 66</ref>
Nearly the whole film was shot with 50&nbsp;mm lenses on [[35 mm film|35&nbsp;mm]] cameras. This trick closely mimicked normal human vision, which helped to involve the audience more.<ref>Rebello, 93</ref>

Before shooting began in November, Hitchcock dispatched assistant director Hilton Green to Phoenix to scout locations and shoot the opening scene. The shot was supposed to be an aerial shot of Phoenix that slowly zoomed into the hotel window of a passionate Marion and Sam. Ultimately, the helicopter footage proved too shaky and had to be spliced with footage from the studio.<ref>Leigh, 24</ref> Another crew filmed day and night footage on Highway 99 between Fresno and Bakersfield, California for projection when Marion drives to Phoenix. They also provided the location shots for the scene where she is pulled over by the highway patrolman.<ref name="Leigh26">Leigh, 26</ref>

[[Image:Psycho05.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The Original Psycho house]]Green also took photos of a prepared list of 140 locations for later reconstruction in the studio. These included many real estate offices and homes like those belonging to Marion and her sister; the Bates's house was based off a Victorian home in [[Kent, Ohio]] near [[Kent State University]].<ref name="Leigh26" /> He also found a girl who looked just like Marion and photographed her whole wardrobe, which would enable Hitchcock to demand realistic looks from Helen Colvig, the wardrobe supervisor.<ref name="Leigh26" />

Both the leads, Perkins and Leigh, were given freedom to interpret their roles and improvise as long as it did not involve moving the camera.<ref>Leigh, 42</ref> An example of Perkins' improvisation is Norman's habit of munching on [[candy corn]].<ref>Leigh, 62</ref>

Throughout filming, Hitchcock created and hid various versions of the "Mother corpse" prop in Janet Leigh's dressing room closet. There were no hard feelings as Leigh took the joke well, and she wonders whether it was done to keep her on edge and thus more in character.<ref>Leigh, 46-47</ref>

During shooting Hitchcock was forced to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Janet's eye and pulls up and out, proved very difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera.<ref>Leigh, 73</ref> Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough.<ref>Leigh, 55</ref> Leigh had trouble saying "Not inordinately" for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes.<ref>Leigh, 59</ref> Lastly, the discovery of Mother scene required complicated coordination of Mother's chair turning around, Vera Miles hitting the light bulb, and a lens flare, which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.<ref>Leigh, 87-88</ref> 

According to Hitchcock, a series of shots with Arbogast going up the stairs in the Bates house before he is stabbed were directed by Hilton Green, working only with storyboard artist Saul Bass's drawings while Hitchcock was incapacitated with a "[[common cold|temperature]]." However, upon viewing the [[rushes|dailies]] of the shots, Hitchcock was forced to scrap them.  He claimed they were "no good" because they didn't portray "an innocent person but a sinister man who was going up those stairs."<ref name="Truffaut">[[Francois Truffaut|Truffaut, Francois]], Helen Scott [1967] (1985-10-02). ''Hitchcock'', Revised, [[New York City|New York]]: 
[[Simon & Schuster]], 273 ISBN 0-671-60429-5 </ref>  The scene was later reshot by Hitchcock, however, a little of the cut footage made its way into the film.

Filming the murder of Arbogast proved tricky due to the overhead camera angle (to hide the film's twist). A camera track constructed on pulleys alongside the stairway together with a chair-like device had to be constructed and thoroughly tested over a period of weeks.<ref>Leigh, 85-86</ref>

===The shower scene===
The most iconic scene in the film, arguably one of the most iconic scenes in film history, is the murder of Janet Leigh's character in the [[shower]]. Although there is little visible gore portrayed on the screen, the shower scene is often regarded as one of the most frightening sequences in cinema history. As such, it spawned numerous myths and legends. It was shot from December 17 to December 23, 1959 and between 71 and 78 angles (the exact number is unknown).<ref>Leigh, 65, 67</ref>  The scene "runs 2 minutes and includes 50 cuts."<ref name="Dancyger">{{cite book|first=Ken|last=Dancyger|title=The Technique of Film and Video Editing: History, Theory, and Practice|location=New York|publisher=Focal Press|year=2002|isbn=0-2408-0420-1}}</ref> Most of the [[Shot (film)|shots]] are [[Extreme Close-Up|extreme closeups]] except for [[medium shot]]s in the shower directly before and directly after the murder. The combination of the close shots with the short duration between cuts makes the sequence feel longer, more subjective, more uncontrolled, and more violent than the images themselves were they presented alone or in a wider angle.

In order to capture the straight-on shot of the shower head, the camera had to be equipped with a long lens. By blocking the inner holes on the spout and placing the camera farther back, the water appeared to be hitting the lens but actually went around and past it.<ref>Rebello, 144</ref>

The soundtrack of screeching violins was an original all-strings piece by composer [[Bernard Herrmann]] entitled "The Murder." Hitchcock originally wanted the sequence (and all motel scenes) to play without music, but Herrmann begged him to try it with the cue he had composed. Afterwards Hitchcock agreed that it vastly intensified the scene and he nearly doubled Herrmann's salary.<ref>Aspinall, David. (September 2003).

It is sometimes claimed that [[Janet Leigh]] was not in the shower the entire time and a body double was used. However, in an interview with [[Roger Ebert]], and in the book ''Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho'', Leigh stated that she was in the scene the entire time; Hitchcock only used a live model as her stand-in for the scenes in which Bates wraps up Marion's body in a shower curtain and places her body in the trunk of her car.<ref>Ebert, Roger.

Retrieved on [[2006-11-27]].</ref> 

Another popular myth is that in order for Janet Leigh's scream in the shower to sound realistic, Hitchcock used ice-cold water. This was denied by Leigh on numerous occasions.<ref>Leitch, Luke.

[[Image:Psycho Knife.PNG|Though graphic in nature, the shower scene features only 3, nearly subliminal frames of film showing penetration.|frame|right]]

The most notorious urban legend arising from the production of ''Psycho'' began when [[Saul Bass]], the graphic designer, who created many of the title sequences of Hitchcock's films and storyboarded some of his scenes, claimed that he had actually directed the shower scene. This claim was refuted by several people associated with the film. Leigh, who is the focus of the scene, stated, "...absolutely not! I have emphatically said this in any interview I've ever given. I've said it to his face in front of other people.... I was in that shower for seven days, and, believe you me, Alfred Hitchcock was right next to his camera for every one of those seventy-odd shots."<ref>Leigh, 67-68</ref> Hilton Green, the assistant director and cameraman, also denies Bass's claim: "There is not a shot in that movie that I didn't roll the camera for. And I can tell you I never rolled the camera for Mr. Bass."<ref>Leigh, 69</ref> Roger Ebert, a long-time admirer of Hitchcock's work, was also amused by the rumor, stating, "It seems unlikely that a perfectionist with an ego like Hitchcock's would let someone else direct such a scene."<ref>Ebert, Roger.  [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19961215/ANSWERMAN/612150303/1023 "Movie Answer Man".]  ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''. (December 15, 1996). Retrieved on [[2006-11-27]].</ref>

According to [[Donald Spoto]] in ''The Dark Side of Genius'', Hitchcock's wife, [[Alma Reville]], spotted a [[blooper]] in one of the last screenings of ''Psycho'' before its official release: After Marion was supposedly dead, one could see her blink. The postmortem blink was edited out and was never seen by audiences. However, confusion surrounding Alma's words led to a myth that Marion is seen swallowing after she dies.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Although Marion's eyes should be dilated after her death, the contacts necessary for this effect would have required six weeks of [[acclimatization]] in order to wear them, so Hitchcock decided to forgo them.<ref>Leigh, 176, 42</ref>

Leigh herself was so affected by this scene when she saw it, that she no longer took showers unless she absolutely had to. Then she would lock all the doors and windows and would leave the bathroom and shower door open.<ref>Leigh, 131</ref>

Janet Leigh and Hitchcock fully discussed what the scene meant: <blockquote>Marion had decided to go back to Phoenix, come clean, and take the consequence, so when she stepped into the tub it was as if she were stepping into the baptismal waters. The spray beating down on her was purifying the corruption from her mind, purging the evil from her soul. She was like a virgin again, tranquil, at peace.<ref>Leigh, 69-70</ref></blockquote>

===Censorship===
According to ''Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho'', the censor board for the [[Hays Code|Hays Office]] (later the [[MPAA]]) wrangled with Hitchcock because some censors insisted they could see one of Janet Leigh's breasts. Hitchcock held onto the print for several days, left it untouched, and resubmitted it for approval. Astoundingly, each of the censors reversed their positions—those who had previously seen the breast now did not, and those who had not, now did. They passed the film after the director removed one shot that showed the buttocks of Leigh's stand-in.<ref name="Leigh112">Leigh, 112</ref> The board was also upset by the racy opening, so Hitchcock said that if they let him keep the shower scene he would reshoot the opening with them on the set. Since they did not show up for the reshoot, the opening stayed.<ref name="Leigh112" />

Another cause of concern for the censors<ref>{{cite news

In film and TV at that time a toilet was never seen, let alone heard. This tradition became so well-known that later shows like ''[[All in the Family]]'' and ''[[Sanford and Son]]'' added a laugh track every time a flushing sound was heard.

Internationally, Hitchcock was forced to make minor changes to the film, mostly to the shower scene. Notably Britain objected to the shot of Norman washing blood from his hands and in Singapore, though the shower scene was left untouched, the murder of Arbogast and a shot of Mother's corpse were removed.<ref>Leigh, 106</ref>

===Promotion===
[[Image:Psycho08.jpg|thumb|225px|left|Theatre poster providing notification of "no late admission" policy]]
Hitchcock did most of the promotion on his own, forbidding Leigh and Perkins from making the usual television, radio, and print interviews for fear of them revealing the plot.<ref>Leigh, 95</ref> Even critics were not given private screenings but rather had to see the film with the general public, which, despite possibly affecting their reviews,<ref>Leigh, 105</ref> certainly preserved the plot.

The film's original trailer features a jovial Hitchcock taking the viewer on a tour of the set, and almost giving away plot details before stopping himself. It is "tracked" with Bernard Herrmann's ''Psycho'' theme, but also jovial music from Hitchcock's comedy ''The Trouble With Harry;'' most of Hitchcock's dialogue is post-synchronized. The trailer was made after completion of the film, and since Janet Leigh was no longer available for filming, Hitchcock had Vera Miles don a blonde wig and scream loudly as he pulled the shower curtain back in the bathroom sequence of the preview. Since the title, "Psycho," instantly covers most of the screen, the switch went unnoticed by audiences for years. However a freeze-frame analysis clearly reveals that it is Vera Miles and not Janet Leigh in the shower during the trailer.<ref name="Leigh9697" />
The most controversial move was Hitchcock's "no late admission" policy for the film, which was abnormal for the time. It was not entirely original as Clouzot had done the same in France for ''Les Diaboliques''.<ref>Rebello, 21</ref> Hitchcock thought that if people entered the theater late and never saw the star actress Janet Leigh, they would feel cheated.<ref name="Leigh9697" /> At first theater owners were up in arms claiming that they would lose business, but after the first day the owners enjoyed long lines of people waiting to see the film.<ref name="Leigh9697" /> 

The film was so successful that it was reissued to theaters in 1965. A year later [[CBS]] purchased the television rights for $450,000. CBS planned to screen the film during fall, but three days prior Valerie Percy, the daughter of an [[Charles H. Percy|Illinois senatorial politician candidate]], was murdered. As her parents slept mere feet away, she was stabbed a dozen times with a double-edged knife. In light of the murder, CBS agreed to postpone the screening, but in the end ''Psycho'' was never shown.<ref name="Leigh187">Leigh, 187</ref> Following another successful theatrical reissue in 1969, the film finally made its way to television in one of Universal's syndicated programming packages for local stations in 1970. ''Psycho'' was aired for twenty years in this format, then leased to cable for two years before returning to syndication as part of the "List of a Lifetime" package.<ref name="Leigh187" />

==Cast==
[[Image:Psycho04.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Iconic publicity photo of Anthony Perkins]]
*'''[[Janet Leigh]]''' as '''Marion Crane'''. In a strange case of life imitating art, [[Janet Leigh]]'s stand-in, Myra Davis, was murdered (stabbed) in her home in 1988. She was also sexually assaulted. The case, which was profiled on ''[[Cold Case Files]]'' on [[A&E Network|A&E]], was solved in 1998 when another woman, Jean Orloff, was found assaulted and murdered in a similar way. Subsequent investigation, circumstantial evidence, and DNA evidence from both scenes brought Kenneth "Sonny" Hunt to justice and death row for both those crimes. Until her death, Leigh continued to receive strange and sometimes threatening calls, letters, and even tapes detailing what they would like to do to Marion Crane. One letter was so "grotesque" that it was passed along to the [[FBI]], two of whose agents visited Leigh and told her the culprits had been located and that she should notify the FBI if she received any more letters of that type.<ref>Leigh, 132-133</ref>

*'''[[Anthony Perkins]]''' as '''Norman Bates'''. After ''Psycho'' had established itself, Perkins, Leigh, and, to a lesser extent, Stefano suffered from typecasting.<ref>Leigh, 156, 187-188, 163</ref> However, when Perkins was asked whether he would still take the role knowing that he would be typecast afterwards he replied with a definite yes.<ref>Leigh, 159</ref>
 
*'''[[Martin Balsam]]''' as '''Detective Milton Arbogast'''
*'''[[John Gavin]]''' as '''Sam Loomis'''

*'''[[Vera Miles]]''' as '''Lila Crane'''

*'''[[Simon Oakland]]''' as '''Dr. Fred Richmond'''

*'''[[John McIntire]]''' as '''Sheriff Al Chambers'''

*'''[[Frank Albertson]]''' as '''Tom Cassidy'''

*'''[[Patricia Hitchcock]]''' as '''Caroline'''

*'''[[Chief Tahachee (actor)|Chief Tahachee]]''' as '''Citizen/Ned Place'''

*'''[[List of Hitchcock cameo appearances|Alfred Hitchcock's cameo]]''' is a signature occurrence in most of his films. In ''Psycho'' he can be seen (7 minutes into the film) through a window, wearing a [[Stetson]] hat, standing outside of Janet Leigh's office.

Norman Bates's mother was voiced by Paul Jasmin, [[Virginia Gregg]], and [[Jeanette Nolan]], who also provided some screams for Lila's discovery of mother's corpse. The three voices were thoroughly mixed, except for the last speech, which is all Gregg's.<ref name="Leigh83" />

==Reception==

Initial reviews of the film were thoroughly mixed.<ref>Leigh, 99</ref> [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' warned people that Hitchcock "comes at you with a club in this frankly intended bloodcurdler" and complained that the "denouement falls quite flat for us."<ref>Review of ''Psycho,'' June 17, 1960, as reprinted in {{cite book

The public loved the film, with lines stretching outside of theaters as people had to wait for the next showing. It broke box-office records in Asia, Japan, China, France, Britain, South America, the United States, and Canada.<ref>Leigh, 99</ref> It is one of the largest-grossing black-and-white films and helped make Hitchcock a multimillionaire and the third-largest shareholder in Universal.<ref>Leigh, 141</ref>

In Britain it shattered attendance records at the London Plaza Cinema, but nearly all British critics panned it, questioning Hitchcock's taste and judgment. Reasons cited for this were the critics' late screenings, forcing them to rush their reviews, their dislike of the gimmicky promotion, and Hitchcock's [[expatriate]] status.<ref>Leigh, 103-104</ref>

Perhaps thanks to the public's response and Hitchcock's efforts at promoting it, the critics did a re-review, and the film was praised. Time magazine switched their opinion from "Hitchcock bears down too heavily in this one" to "superlative" and "masterly," and [[Bosley Crowther]] put it on his Top Ten list of 1960.<ref>Leigh, 105-106</ref>

''Psycho'' was criticized for making other filmmakers more willing to show gore, and indeed a scant three years later ''Bloodfeast'', considered to be the first "[[gore film]]," was released.<ref name="Leigh180181">Leigh, 180-181</ref> ''Psycho'''s success financially and critically had others trying to ride its coattails.

''Psycho'' was nominated for four Academy Awards: [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] (Janet Leigh), [[Academy Award for Directing|Direction]] (Alfred Hitchcock), [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Black and White Cinematography]] (John Russell), and [[Academy Award for Best Art Direction|Black and White Art Direction-set decoration]] (Joseph Hurley, Robert Clatworthy; George Milo). It did not win any Academy awards, though Leigh did win a [[Golden Globe]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress - Motion Picture|Best Supporting Actress]], and Perkins tied for best actor in an award from the International Board of Motion Picture Reviewers. Stefano was nominated for two writing awards by [[Edgar Award|Edgar Allen Poe Awards]] and the [[Writers Guild of America]]; he won the former only.

===Innovations in film===
{{spoiler}}
In his novel, Bloch used an uncommon plot structure: he repeatedly introduced sympathetic [[protagonist]]s, then killed them off. This played on his reader's expectations of traditional plots, leaving them uncertain and anxious. Hitchcock recognized the effect this approach could have on audiences, and utilized it in his adaptation, killing off [[Janet Leigh]]'s character at the end of the first act. This daring plot device, coupled with the fact that the character was played by the biggest box-office name in the film, was a shocking and disorienting turn of events in 1960.
{{endspoiler}}
The most original and influential moment in the film is the "shower scene," which became iconic in pop culture because it is one of the most terrifying scenes ever filmed. Part of its effectiveness was due to the use of startling editing techniques borrowed from the Soviet [[Soviet montage theory|montage]] filmmakers, and to [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s intense and imaginative musical score.

''Psycho'' is a prime example of the type of film that appeared in the 1960s after the erosion of the [[Production Code]]. It was unprecedented in its depiction of sexuality and violence. In addition, the censors were upset by the shot of a flushing toilet; at that time, the idea of seeing a toilet onscreen - let alone being flushed - was taboo in American movies and TV shows.  According to [[Entertainment Weekly]], "The Production Code censors ... had no objection to the bloodletting, the [[oedipus|oedipal]] murder theme, or even the shower scene—but did ask that Hitchcock remove the word ''[[transvestite]]'' from the film,  He didn't."<ref name="EW" /> At one point, Hitchcock actually considered releasing the film without [[Hays Code|censorial]] approval.  Its box office success helped propel Hollywood toward more graphic displays of previously-censored themes.  

''Psycho'' is widely considered to be the first film in the [[slasher movie]] genre.<ref>{{cite web

==Interpretation==

The film often features shadows, mirrors, windows, and, less so, water. The shadows are present from the very first scene where the blinds make bars on Marion and Sam as they peer out the window. The stuffed birds' shadows loom over Marion as she eats, and Mother is only seen in shadows until the very end. More subtly, backlighting turns the rakes in the hardware store into talons above Vera Miles's head.<ref name="Leigh9093">Leigh, 90-93</ref>

Mirrors reflect: Marion as she packs, her eyes as she checks the rear-view mirror, her face in the policeman's sunglasses, her hands as she counts out the money in the car dealership's bathroom. A motel window serves as a mirror by reflecting Marion and Norman together. Hitchcock shoots through Marion's windshield and the telephone booth, when Arbogast phones Sam and Lila. The heavy downpour can be seen as foreshadowing of the shower, and it letting up can be seen as a symbol of Marion making up her mind to return to Phoenix.<ref name="Leigh9093" />

There are coded references to birds. Marion's last name is Crane, and she is from Phoenix. Norman's hobby is stuffing birds, and he comments that Marion eats like a bird.<ref name="Leigh9093" /> 

==Sequels and remakes==
The film spawned three sequels: ''[[Psycho II]]'' (1983), ''[[Psycho III]]'' (1986), and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' (1990), the latter being a [[TV movie]] written by the original screenplay author, [[Joseph Stefano]]. Anthony Perkins returned to his role in all three sequels, and the voice of Norman Bates' mother was maintained by noted radio actress [[Virginia Gregg]] with the exception of ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning|Psycho IV]]'', where the role was played by [[Olivia Hussey]].  Vera Miles also reprised her role in ''Psycho II''.  The sequels were generally considered inferior to the original.<ref>[[Roger Ebert|Ebert, Roger]].  "''Psycho III''." ''Roger Ebert's Movie Home Companion''.  Kansas City: Andrews and McMeel, 1991</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Psycho III|work=Variety|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117794204.html?categoryid=31&cs=1&p=0 |date=Jan 1, 1986|accessdate=2006-11-26}}</ref> Hitchcock did not participate in the making of any of the ''Psycho'' sequels (he died before any of them were made).
A [[spinoff]] of the ''Psycho'' series is ''[[Bates Motel]]'' (1987) a failed [[Television pilot|TV pilot]] turned TV movie. In it, the Bates Motel is taken over by a new, equally mentally ill owner.

In 1998, [[Gus Van Sant]] [[remake|remade]] ''Psycho''. The film is in color and features a different cast, but aside from this it is a virtually shot-for-shot remake copying Hitchcock's camera movements and editing.  {{see|Psycho (1998 film)}}

''[[A Conversation With Norman]]'' (2005), directed by [[Jonathan M. Parisen]], was a film inspired by ''Psycho''. It premiered in [[New York City]] just three days short of the 45th anniversary of the premiere of the original film. It starred Christopher Englese as Norman, Grace Orosz as Marion and Tom Loggins as Sam.

==Popular culture references==
Psycho is commonly regarded as one of Hitchcock's best films.  Highly praised, the film is referenced countless times in popular culture. In television and film, great homage is paid to ''Psycho,'' especially the infamous and possibly best remembered "Shower Scene," complete with shrieking violins.  

*[[Liquid Television]]'s [[Stick Figure Theater]] had a stick figure version of the intro with a stick figure Alfred Hitchcock. 
* ''[[The Simpsons]]'' character of [[Principal Skinner]], and his relationship with his overbearing mother, was originally a parody of ''Psycho''. A scene in the episode "[[Brother from the Same Planet]]" shows Skinner opening the blinds in his office. Peering at his house from the window, he sees what looks like the Bates' house on a hill, and says "There's Mother now." Later episodes have revealed the floor plan of the Skinners' house to be identical to that of the Bates'.
* In a [[Thanksgiving]] episode of [[FRIENDS]], [[Chandler]] tells the rest of the gang when [[Monica Geller|Monica]] had accidentally cut off his toe. The sequence shows Monica accidentally dropping a butcher's knife. The knife falls on Chandler feet with the screeching violins music in the background.
* "[[Cape Feare]]", another episode of ''The Simpsons'', had a scene where the character [[Sideshow Bob]] was planning the murder of [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] at the Bates Motel during a bad storm.
* Part of the title's musical theme is sampled in [[Busta Rhymes]]' hit, "Gimme Some More."
* In an episode of ''[[The Brak Show]]'' entitled "Psychoklahoma," some events from the film are combined with elements of the musical ''[[Oklahoma!]]'', and are set to music, creating a bizarre, yet humorous, play.
*In the film ''Scream'', after supposedly being seriously injured and left for dead, Billy Loomis quotes Norman Bates by saying, "'We all go a little mad sometimes.' Anthony Perkins, ''Psycho''".
*The name of the high school where [[Sissy Spacek]]'s character in ''[[Carrie (film)|Carrie]]'' attends is called Bates High School.  This is supposedly "director [[Brian De Palma]]'s homage to Hitchcock's ''Psycho''."<ref name="EW" />
*In an episode of the cartoon [[Courage the Cowardly Dog]], Katz is the owner of the deadly Katz Motel.
*In ''[[American Dad]]'' episode "[[A Smith in the Hand]]", [[Stan Smith]] checks into the '[[Bates Motel]] to have some "privacy".
*[[Bob Dylan]] made several wry references to the movie in his 1964 song "Motorpsycho Nitemare," even invoking the name of [[Tony Perkins]].
*Darla's entrance in [[Finding Nemo]] is marked by the "shrieking violins" theme.
===Shower scene parodies===
* In ''The Simpsons'' episode [[Itchy & Scratchy & Marge]], after [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]] hits him on the head with a mallet in the garage, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] rips the table cloth and falls to the ground, knocking over a bucket of red paint that spills and spirals into a water hole on the floor. 
* In an episode of ''[[Kirby: Right Back at Ya!]]'', [[Escargoon]] is repeatedly bashed with a [[hammer]] by [[King Dedede]] while showering in a haunted house. 
*[[Mel Brooks]] spoofed the shower scene and other famous Hitchcock scenes in ''[[High Anxiety]]''.
*[[Brian De Palma]] spoofed the scene to good effect in ''[[Phantom of the Paradise]]''.  
*[[Tobe Hooper]] parodied it in the opening of [[The Funhouse]].  
*[[Ren & Stimpy]] featured a parody of the shower scene in the episode [[Mad Dog Höek/Haunted House#.22Haunted House.22|Haunted House]]. 
*In [[Billy Joel|Billy Joel's]] song "[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]," the infamous and iconic shower scene music in the background is heard when he mentions ''Psycho''.
*In 1992 movie ''[[Wayne's World]]'' Garth is heard imitating the music from the shower scene whilst stabbing a donut-man.
*In the film ''[[Looney Tunes: Back In Action]]'', [[Bugs Bunny]] imitates the shower scene, complete with pouring a bottle of [[Hershey's]] chocolate syrup down the drain.
*The shower scene was also parodied in ''[[Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol]]'', ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'', ''[[Colonel's Bequest]]'', ''[[National Lampoon's Vacation]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', the [[gay]] [[exploitation]] [[horror film]] ''[[City In Panic]]'', ''[[That '70s Show]]'', ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', and ''[[Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends]]''.
*Reference to the shower scene is also made by ''[[Pep Streebeck]]'' (''[[Tom Hanks]]'') in ''[[Dragnet (1987 film)]]'' after seeing granny Monday's house, which resembles the ''[[Bates Motel]]''.
