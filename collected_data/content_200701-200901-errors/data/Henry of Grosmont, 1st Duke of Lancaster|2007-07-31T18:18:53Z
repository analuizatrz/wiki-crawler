'''Henry of Grosmont, Duke of Lancaster''' (''c.''1310 &ndash; [[24 March]], [[1361]]) was a member of the [[House of Lancaster|English royal family]] in the [[14th century]], and was a prominent English [[diplomat]], [[politician]], and [[soldier]].

Henry was born to [[Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster]] and [[Maud Chaworth]] ''c.''1310, and not 1299-1300 as stated in earlier works.<ref name="DNB">W. M. Ormrod, 'Henry of Lancaster'.</ref> He became a soldier in the English army. He led various campaigns in the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] and [[France]] during the [[Hundred Years' War]], winning his greatest victory at the [[battle of Auberoche]] in [[1345]], the ransom of which was worth around £50,000.<ref>Fowler, ''King's Lieutenant'', p. 61.</ref> He later orchestrated a monumental (but temporary) peace treaty with France. This placed him in a favorable light with the [[King of England]], [[Edward III of England]]. Throughout his life, he held many honours, including: [[Earl of Derby]], [[Earl of Lancaster]], [[Earl of Leicester]], [[Earl of Lincoln]], [[Barons of Halton|Baron of Halton]] and [[Duke of Lancaster]]; he was also a founding [[Knight of the Garter]] and [[Lord High Steward]] to Edward III.  

In [[1354]], he wrote the ''Livre de Seyntz Medicines''. This was a work written in the form of a prayer in which Henry confesses to his sins, explains various real and mythical medical remedies in terms of their theological symbolism, and exhorts the reader to greater morality.  It is organized around seven wounds which Henry claims to have, representing the seven sins.  It is notable for its extremely personal character, and as an example of the melding of French and English following the Norman conquest.

==Family==

He married [[Isabel de Beaumont]], daughter of [[Henry de Beaumont|Henry Beaumont Earl-of Buchan]] and Alice Comyn. Their children were:

* [[Maud, Countess of Leicester]]. Married first Ralph Stafford and secondly [[William I, Duke of Bavaria]].
* [[Blanche of Lancaster]]. She married [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster]])
