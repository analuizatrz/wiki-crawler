'''''Bánh''''' is a [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] term translating loosely as "cake" or "bread." As such, it may, with the addition of qualifying adjectives, refer to a wide variety of distinct cakes, buns, pastries, and other similar food items from [[Vietnamese cuisine]], which may be cooked by steaming, baking, frying, deep-frying, or boiling. In general, anything made from [[flour]] can be called ''bánh''.

''Bánh'' may also refer to certain varieties of noodles, such as for example ''[[bánh canh]]'' or ''[[bánh hỏi]]''.

Each variety of ''bánh'' is designated by a descriptive word or phrase that follows the word ''bánh'', such as ''[[bánh bò]]'' (literally "cow cake") or ''[[bánh chuối]]'' (literally "banana cake").

''Bánh'' that are wrapped in leaves before steaming are called ''[[bánh lá]]'' (literally "leaf cakes").

The term is derived from the [[Sino-Vietnamese]] character [[wikt:餅|餅]] (which is pronounced [[Bing (Chinese flatbread)|bǐng]] in Mandarin Chinese).
