'''Shannon Matilda Wells Lucid''' (born January 14, 1943) is an [[United States|American]] [[biochemist]] and a [[NASA]] [[astronaut]]. At one time, she held the record for the longest duration stay in space by a woman. She has flown in space five times including a prolonged mission aboard the [[Mir]] space station.

==Early life and education==
Lucid was born in [[Shanghai]], [[China]], to [[Baptist]] missionary parents Oscar and Myrtle Wells, but grew up in [[Bethany, Oklahoma]]. She attended the [[University of Oklahoma]] and obtained a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[biochemistry]] from that school in 1973.

She is married to Michael F. Lucid of Indianapolis, Indiana and they have two daughters and one son, and five granddaughters.

==NASA career==

Lucid was selected for the [[NASA Astronaut Corps]] in 1978.

Lucid's first space flight was in June 1985 on [[Space Shuttle Discovery]]'s mission [[STS-51-G]]. She also flew on shuttle missions [[STS-34]] in 1989, [[STS-43]] in 1991, and [[STS-58]] in 1993.

Lucid is best known for her fifth spaceflight, when she spent 188 days in space, from March 22 to September 26, 1996, including 179 days aboard ''[[Mir]]'', the Russian [[space station]]. Both to and from Mir, she travelled on [[Space Shuttle Atlantis]], launching on [[STS-76]] and returning on [[STS-79]]. Her stay on Mir was not expected to last so long but her return was delayed twice, extending her stay by about six weeks. During the mission she performed numerous life science and physical science experiments. As a result of her time aboard Mir, she held the record for the most hours in orbit by a non-Russian and most hours in orbit by a woman. On June 16, 2007, her record for longest duration spaceflight by a woman was exceeded by [[Sunita Williams]] aboard the [[International Space Station]].<ref>

From 2002 to 2003, Lucid served as the [[NASA Chief Scientist|Chief Scientist]] of NASA. Later, Lucid was a CAPCOM ([[capsule communicator]]) for [[STS-114]] in 2005, [[STS-116]] in 2006, [[STS-118]] and [[STS-120]] in 2007,  and [[STS-122]] and [[STS-124]] in 2008.

==Awards and honors==
Lucid was awarded the [[Congressional Space Medal of Honor]] in December 1996, the tenth person and first woman to be given that honor.
