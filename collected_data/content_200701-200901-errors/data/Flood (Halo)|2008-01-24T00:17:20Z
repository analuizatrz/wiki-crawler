The '''Flood''' are fictional [[parasite|parasitic]] [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] life forms in the ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' video game series. They are introduced in ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'' as a secondary enemy to the game's protagonist, [[Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief]], and return in ''[[Halo 2]]''  and ''[[Halo 3]]'' to fill the same role. The Flood are driven by a desire to infest sentient life they encounter, and are depicted as such a threat that the ancient [[Forerunner (Halo)|Forerunner]] were forced to kill most of themselves and all other sentient life nearly 100,000 years before the beginning of ''Halo'' in an effort to starve the Flood to death.

The player's discovery of the Flood in ''Halo: Combat Evolved'' is a major plot twist that is kept suspenseful and tense, and was one of the surprises reviewers noted positively upon release. The Flood's return in ''Halo 2'' and ''Halo 3'' was less enthusiastically praised. Reaction to the faction varied; while some publications found the Flood too derivative and a clich√©d element of science fiction, ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard Magazine]]'' rated them among the greatest villains of all time.

==Game development==
The Flood were added early in the game development stage of ''Halo: Combat Evolved'', before the game had made its jump from the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] platform and Bungie was bought by [[Microsoft]]; a design for one Flood form appeared as early as 1997.<ref>{{cite book |last= Trautmann|first=Eric|title=The Art of Halo|year= 2004|publisher= Del Ray Publishing|location=New York |isbn=0-345-47586-0 |pages=67}}</ref> The early design for the Flood was done by Bungie artist and writer Robert McLees, who considers himself "the architect" of the Flood;<ref>{{cite web |author=Smith, Luke|url= http://www.bungie.net/News/content.aspx?type=topnews&cid=12753|title= Halo Universe: Covenant Weapons|accessdate=2007-11-09 |format= [[HTML]]|work= [[Bungie.net]]|date=[[2007-09-06]]}}</ref> the Flood's roots are reflected in some concept art of a "fungal zombie" that McLees did for the earlier Bungie game ''[[Marathon 2: Durandal]]''.<ref>{{cite web |author=McLees, Rob|url= http://www.bungie.net/projects/marathon/asset_popup_viewer.aspx?at=51&cc=33&item=2|title= Marathon Series Concept Art|accessdate=2007-11-09 |format= [[HTML]], [[JPEG]]|work=[[Bungie.net]]}}</ref> At one point, the ringworld ''Halo'' featured dinosaur-like terrestrial creatures, but due to gameplay constraints, these were dropped.

Yeah, and bad sci-fi too."<ref>{{cite web|date=[[2002-01-09]]|url=http://halo.bungie.org/misc/interviews/getinthegame.butcher.010902/|title=Halo Chat with Developer Chris Butcher|work=[[Halo.Bungie.Org]]|accessdate=2007-09-03}}</ref>

==Physiology==
[[Image:Flood3.jpg|thumb|right|The "Infection" stage of the Flood.]]
The Flood are depicted as having a complicated lifecycle; small, base forms of Flood infect and mutate hosts into other forms, which ultimately repeat the cycle by spawning the smaller forms. The largest self-contained form that the Flood can produce itself, without using other biomasses,<ref>{{cite book |last= Trautmann|first=Eric|title=The Art of Halo|year= 2004|publisher= Del Ray Publishing|location=New York |isbn=0-345-47586-0 |pages=64}}</ref> is an "Infection form". As its name suggests, the Infection form homes in on hosts (living or dead), attempting to drive sharp spines into the host and tap into the nervous system. This tap causes the host to be incapacitated, while the Infection form burrows into the host's body and begins the mutation process, bringing the host under Flood control.<ref>{{cite book |last= Dietz|first= William|title=[[Halo: The Flood]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45921-0 |pages=140}}</ref> Depending on the size or condition of the body, the Infection form mutates the hapless host into various specialized forms in the continual drive for more food. 
          
The Flood are also seen to create forms for tasks other than finding sustenance. In ''Halo: Combat Evolved'', the Flood create "Brain forms"; these spongy creatures, resembling a large bag of flesh with tentacles, can be used to interrogate victims, stripping information from the mind of the host before eventually assimilating the host into itself entirely.<ref name=tf200>{{cite book |last= Dietz|first= William|title=[[Halo: The Flood]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45921-0 |pages=200}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Dietz|first= William|title=[[Halo: The Flood]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45921-0 |pages=225}}</ref> In the ''[[Halo Graphic Novel]]'', Flood are seen piling dead matter together in order to form a [[Gravemind]]; this form serves as a central intelligence for the infection, and is first encountered in ''[[Halo 2]]''.

==Appearances==
===''Halo: Combat Evolved''===
{{seealso|Halo: Combat Evolved}}
The Flood make their surprise appearance more than halfway through ''Halo: Combat Evolved''<nowikI>'</nowiki>s campaign, during the mission "343 Guilty Spark". The [[Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief]] is sent on an extraction mission by Cortana to try and find Captain [[Characters in the Halo series#Jacob Keyes|Jacob Keyes]], who disappears in a swamp while looking for a weapons cache.<ref>{{cite book |last= Nylund|first= Eric|title=[[Halo: First Strike]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-46781-7 |pages=200}}</ref> The Master Chief finds that the Covenant have released the Flood accidentally, and the sheer numbers of the parasite overwhelm Keyes and his squad. While most of the [[United Nations Space Command|UNSC]] Marines are converted to Combat forms, Keyes is interrogated by the Flood in an attempt to learn the location of Earth. Keyes successfully resists,<ref>{{cite book |last= Nylund|first= Eric|title=[[Halo: First Strike]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-46781-7 |pages=199}}</ref> but is assimilated into a Brain form before the Master Chief can rescue him. The emergence of the Flood prompts Halo's "Monitor", [[343 Guilty Spark]], to enlist the help of the Master Chief in activating Halo's defenses and preventing a Flood outbreak.<ref>'''343 Guilty Spark''': Greetings. I am the Monitor of installation 04. I am 343 Guilty Spark. Someone has released the Flood. My function is to prevent it from leaving this installation. But I require your assistance. Come. This way. - {{cite video game| title = [[Halo: Combat Evolved]]| developer = Bungie Studios| publisher = Microsoft| date = 2001| platform =[[Xbox]]| version = | level = 343 Guilty Spark| language = English }}</ref> When Master Chief learns of the devastation that Halo would cause if activated, he detonates the ''[[United Nations Space Command#Pillar of Autumn|Pillar of Autumn]]''<nowikI>'</nowiki>s engines, destabilizing the ring and preventing the Flood from escaping.

In ''Halo'', the Flood appear in three main forms. The largest hosts, namely humans and [[Covenant Elite]]s, are turned by the Infection forms into "Combat forms", which are described as extremely powerful and resilient warriors. Combat forms are able to resist extreme punishment while utilizing either the weapons of their hosts or the long, whip-like tentacles developed during their mutation.<ref name=h295>{{cite book |author= Piggyback||title=''Halo 2: The Official Strategy Guide: The Flood]''|year= 2004|publisher= Piggyback Interactive Ltd.|location=United States |isbn=0-7615-4473-9|pages=95}}</ref> If a host is unsuitable for combat it will mutate into a "Carrier form", which transports and spreads more Infection forms. The upper-body of Carrier form swells into a bulbous sac while the legs remain intact. When it moves close enough to a potential host, the Carrier form explodes like a [[grenade]], both releasing its contents and killing anything within range.

===''Halo Graphic Novel''===
{{seealso|Halo Graphic Novel}}
The 2006 one-shot ''[[Halo Graphic Novel]]'' expands upon the Flood's release on [[Halo (megastructure)#Installation 04|Installation 04]] in two stories. The first, ''Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor'', takes place at the same times as the Master Chief hunts for Keyes during ''Halo: Combat Evolved''. The Flood manage to pilot a Covenant dropship off Halo, and crash-land the vessel in the hangar of a Covenant agricultural ship, ''[[Covenant (Halo)#Infinite Succor|Infinite Succor]]''. Successfully assimilating most of the Covenant and wildlife aboard the ship, the Flood are stopped by a Covenant strike team led by [[Characters in the Halo series#Rtas 'Vadumee|Rtas 'Vadumee]], who sets the ship on a course into the nearby sun.<ref>{{cite book |last= Hammock|first= Lee|title=The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor|year= 2006|publisher= Marvel Comics|location=|isbn=0785123725 |pages=}}</ref> The second story, "Breaking Quarantine", details the escape of Sergeant [[Characters in the Halo series#Avery Johnson|Avery Johnson]] from the clutches of the Flood, immediately after Keyes' squad is overrun during ''Halo''.

The Flood appear in ''Halo 3'' with new abilities and forms. A new, mutable Flood combat form appears, called the "Pure Form." Depending on the situation, these forms can mutate into even more specialized types. According to Bungie, these creatures are formed when the Flood gain access to large enough stocks of calcium, which it uses to form a framework for biomass collected from other species.

==Cultural impact==
===Merchandise===
The Flood have been featured in several series of ''Halo'' [[action figure]]s, produced by Joyride Studios. For ''Halo: Combat Evolved'', Joyride produced a Carrier Form and Infection form bundle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmdstore.com/halo-1-action-figures-series-5-flood-carrier-form.html|title=Halo Action Figure, Series 5: Flood Carrier Form|work=cmdstore.com|accessdate=2007-11-22}}</ref> ''Halo 2''{{'}}s series contains both a human Combat Form and Infection form (bundled with the Master Chief), which were released after the video game had hit shelves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmdstore.com/halo-2-action-figures-series-6-human-flood.html|title=Halo 2 Action Figure, Series 6: Human Flood|work=cmdstore.com|accessdate=2007-11-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmdstore.com/halo-2-action-figures-series-8-master-chief-v4.html|title=Halo 2 Action Figure, Series 8: Master Chief|work=cmdstore.com|accessdate=2007-11-22}}</ref>

===Critical reception===
The surprise appearance of the Flood during ''Halo: Combat Evolved'' was seen as an important plot twist.<ref name=gamespot>{{cite web|author=Fielder, Joe|date=[[2001-11-09]]|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox/action/halo/review.html?page=4|title=Halo: Combat Evolved'' for Xbox Review|work=gamespot.com|accessdate=2007-09-04}}</ref> Actress [[Aisha Tyler]] said that "[every time the Flood appear], even though I've played it a million times, is a totally terrifying moment."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gameroom.mlgpro.com/view/zyiJ5z9YWvg.html|title=Sci vs. Fi - ''Halo 3'' Documentary|work=[[Major League Gaming]]|accessdate=2007-10-05|date=[[2007-10-02]]}}</ref> [[Gamasutra]], writing about video game plots, gives the example of the Flood not only as an important reversal to the story of ''Halo'', but a textbook example of how games and their stories are made more interesting by twists in the plot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20050727/sutherland_02.shtml|title=What Every Game Developer Needs to Know about Story|work=[[Gamasutra]]|author=Sutherland, John|date=[[2005-07-25]]|accessdate=2007-12-23}}</ref>

Despite this, the response to the presence of the Flood in ''Halo 2'' and ''Halo 3'' was mixed. A panel of online reviewers noted that the Flood appeared in ''Halo 2'' for no obvious reasons, and were simply described as "aggravating" to play against.<ref name=free>{{cite web|author=Team Freemont|year=[[2004]]|url=http://www.teamfremont.com/reviews/Halo2.shtml|title=Team Freemont: Halo 2 review|work=teamfremont.com|accessdate=2007-09-05}}</ref> Similarly, reviewers including Victor Godinez of ''Dallas News'' felt that the Flood were too derivative of other [[science fiction|sci-fi]] stereotypes, and functioned as "space [[zombie]]s".<ref name=free/><ref>{{cite web|author=Godinez, Victor|date=[[2006-07-16]] |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/ptech/gamereviews2/071806ccdrPTECHhalobook.1d4d3a2.html|title=Review: The Halo Graphic Novel|work=dallasnews.com|accessdate=2007-09-06}}</ref> ''Gamecritics.com'' noted in their review of ''Halo 3'' that even though the Flood looked better than ever, their single strategy of rushing the player proved tedious.<ref name="gamecritics review">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamecritics.com/halo-3-review|title=''Halo 3'' Review|author=Weissenberger, Daniel|date=[[2007-10-01]]|accessdate=2007-10-02|work=gamecritics.com}}</ref>

Lee Hammock, writer of the ''[[Halo Graphic Novel]]'' story ''The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor'', described the basis of the story as a way to showcase the true danger of the Flood as an intelligent menace, rather than something the player happens upon and shoots. Hammock also stated that the story would prove the intelligent nature of the Flood, and "hopefully [[euthanization|euthanize]] the idea that they are just space zombies";<ref>{{cite book |last= Hammock|first= Lee|title=The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor|year= 2006|publisher= Marvel Comics|location=|isbn=0785123725 |pages=}}</ref> this treatment was received positively by critics.<ref>{{cite web|author=Scrofani|date=[[2006-07-16]]|url=http://www.gzpro.org/gameofthemonth.htm|title=Game Zone Pro: ''Halo Graphic Novel''|work=gzpro.org|accessdate=2007-09-06}}</ref> In 2006, ''Wizard Magazine'' ranked the Flood as the 77th Greatest Villains of all time.<ref>{{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |month= |title=Top 100 Greatest Villains |journal=Wizard Magazine |volume= |issue= 177|pages= |id= |url= |accessdate= 2007-09-06 |quote= }})</ref>
