'''USS ''Hoel'' (DDG-13)''', named for Lieutenant Commander [[William R. Hoel]] USN ([[1824]]&ndash;[[1879]]), was a [[Charles F. Adams class destroyer|''Charles F. Adams''-class]] guided-missile armed [[destroyer]].

''Hoel'' was laid down by [[Defoe Shipbuilding Company]] in [[Bay City, Michigan]], on [[3 August]] [[1959]], launched on [[4 August]] [[1960]] by Mrs. Harry H. Long, granddaughter of Lieutenant Commander Hoel and commissioned on [[16 June]] [[1962]].  

''Hoel'' served as plane guard for [[Aircraft carrier]]s on [[Yankee Station]] in the [[Tonkin Gulf]], participated in [[Sea Dragon]] operations, patrolled on [[Search and rescue]] duties and carried out [[Naval Gunfire Support]] missions during the conflict in [[Vietnam]].  

''Hoel'' was decommissioned on [[1 October]] [[1990]], stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on [[20 November]] [[1992]] and sold on [[20 June]] [[1994]].

The ''Hoel'' was one of seven decommissioned US naval vessels purchased by [[Charleston Shipbuilders Inc.]] (CSI) in 1994.  The corporation planned to use the ships' power plants to generate electricity which they would then sell commercially.  In theory, each ship would be able to generate approximately fifty [[megawatt]]s of [[electricity]], enough to supply approximately 150,000 households. 

The city of [[Manaus, Brazil]] had rapidly expanded since it was declared a tax-free zone by the [[Brazil]]ian government in [[1967]].  [[Eletronorte]], the local power utility service, had been unable to keep up with the increasing demand and Manaus experienced frequent [[blackout]]s.  In [[1997]], CSI negotiated a thirty million dollar contract to supply power to Manaus.

The ''Hoel'' was chosen as the ship to be used. However, the plans of both companies were too optimistic. Eletronorte announced that ''Hoel'' would be delivering power within only a few days of its arrival in Manaus. CSI had failed to test the ship's equipment fully before departing for Brazil and failed to appreciate how many repairs the ship's 38-year-old power plant might require.  The ship ended up needing weeks of work after its arrival in Brazil before it could begin generating power and numerous repairs after that.  Repairs were much more difficult to accomplish in Brazil because the parts and technicians now had to be brought in from CSI's headquarters back in the [[United States]].  Meanwhile, many people in Manaus had become angry over the failed power delivery and there were violent protests.  ''Hoel'' was never able to generate more than a quarter of the electricity that had been promised and that only periodically.  After a year of failed attempts, Eletronorte cancelled its contract with CSI.
