'''Zveno''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Звено, [[Chain|Chain link]] or a military unit [[Flight (military unit)|"Flight"]]) was a [[parasite aircraft]] project developed in the [[Soviet Union]] during the 1930s. It consisted of a [[Tupolev TB-1]] or a [[Tupolev TB-3]] heavy bomber acting as a mothership for between two and five fighters. Depending on the Zveno variant, the fighters either launched with the mothership or docked in flight, and they could refuel from the bomber. The definitive '''Zveno-SPB''' using a TB-3 and two [[Polikarpov I-16]]s, each armed with two 250 kg (550 lb) bombs, was used operationally with good results against strategic targets in [[Romania]] during the opening stages of [[World War II]].

In June 1931, [[Vladimir Sergeyevich Vakhmistrov]] of the [[Soviet Scientific Research Institute of the Air Forces]] started work on combinations of fighters rigidly attached to heavy bomber aircraft. The system was envisioned to serve several purposes:

# Delivery of fighters beyond their conventional range
# Provision of bombers with escort fighters
# Use of fighters for dive bombing with heavier bombs than they would be able to take off with on their own
# Using the added thrust of parasite aircraft to get a heavily-laden bomber airborne.<ref name="shavrov">{{cite book|author=Shavrov V.B.|year=1985|title=История конструкции самолетов в СССР до 1938 г. (3 изд.)|language=Russian|publisher=Mashinostroenie|id=ISBN 5-217-03112-3}}</ref>

In all ''Zveno'' configurations, all aircraft were piloted and all had their engines turned on — it was expected that the combined thrust would more than offset the weight and actually improve the performance of the mothership compared to conventional bombers.<ref name="stefan"/> The fighters were rigidly attached via pyramid-shaped metal frames with bomb latches controlled by the fighter pilots (on Zveno-1, the front latched were controlled by the bomber crew, while the back latch was controlled by the pilot, this was changed to all-pilot control in the next version).<ref name="stefan"/> The original design included umbilical fuel lines which permitted the fighters to use fuel from the bomber while attached,<ref name="stefan"/> although this was not fully implemented in practice.

The first successful flight of '''Zveno-1''' using a [[Tupolev TB-1]] mothership and two [[Tupolev I-4]] fighters mounted on top of the wings took place on [[3 December]] [[1931]]. An error in the sequence of opening the latches by the bomber crew resulted in one of the fighters prematurely separating, but the TB-1 with an I-4 attached to one of the wings remained in controlled flight and the second fighter was soon uneventfully deployed.<ref name="stefan"/> After latch control was fully moved into the fighters, the normal launch procedure consisted of pilots opening the tail lock and then pulling on the control stick to open the front locks and separate from the bomber.<ref name="stefan"/> As predicted, the presence of docked fighters had a minimal impact on performance of the mothership, and '''Zveno-2''' [[Tupolev TB-3]] carrying three [[Polikarpov I-5]] fighters handled the same as an ordinary bomber.<ref name="stefan"/> To mount the aircraft on the wings, they were pushed up special ramps but the centerline aircraft had to be lifted on top of the fuselage by hand. This was so cumbersome that the centerline I-5 became a permanent fixture on top of the Zveno-2 TB-3 and never started in the air.<ref name="stefan"/> At one point, the centerline I-5, still with a pilot at the controls to operate the engine, had the wings and the tail surfaces removed and was used purely as fifth powerplant for the bomber mothership.<ref name="stefan"/>

The '''Zveno-3''' in which TB-3 carried two [[Grigorovich I-Z]] fighters under the wings presented a different challenge — the I-Z was a monoplane with fixed landing gear which touched the ground while it was suspended under the mothership. To accommodate the uneven ground during takeoffs, the fighters were attached via a floating frame that permitted vertical movement relative to the TB-3. However, immediately after takeoff the I-Z pilots had to push forward on the control sticks to lock the frame in the fixed bottom position — if the fighter-bomber was not rigid in flight, the bomber became extremely difficult to control.<ref name="stefan"/> During one of the test flights, I-Z pilot Korotkov incorrectly timed the locking maneuver and the lift generated by his fighter broke the docking frame and crashed him into the bottom of the mothership's wing. As the bomber came in for an emergency landing with both fighters still attached, the slow landing speed of the TB-3 resulted in loss of lift for the I-Z which fell away, killing Korotkov.<ref name="stefan"/> This was the most serious accident of the entire Zveno program despite the inherent complexity of carrying as many as five aircraft, performing mid-air launches and dockings, and damage to the motherships by propellers and landing gear of the fighters. Tests with various combinations of aircraft determined that top-mounted configurations presented the most difficulty in docking due to turbulent airflow coming off the mothership's wings.<ref name="shavrov"/> The problem of safe underwing attachment was solved with the appearance of the [[Polikarpov I-16]] fighter with retractable landing gear. This permitted the use of the same rigid mounting frames as for the top-mounted aircraft.<ref name="stefan"/>

The mothership and its fighters were unofficially nicknamed the ''Vakhmistrov's Circus'' (Цирк Вахмистрова).<ref name="ivanov">{{cite book|author=Ivanov S.V.|year=2001|language=Russian|title=Боевой ишак Сталинских Соколов, часть 3|series=Война в воздухе 43}}</ref>

;Zveno-1
:[[Tupolev TB-1]] and two [[Tupolev I-4]] on top of the wings. The normally [[biplane|sesquiplane]] I-4s had the bottom wings removed (with no ill effect on flight characteristics) due to clearance problems with TB-1 propellers.<ref name="stefan">{{cite book|author=[[Petr Mikhailovich Stefanovskiy|Stefanovskiy, P.M.]]|year=1968|language=Russian|title=Триста неизвестных|publisher=Voyenizdat}}</ref> First flight [[3 December]] [[1931]]. The TB-1 was piloted by A. I. Zalevskiy and A. R. Sharapov, the I-4s were piloted by [[Valery Chkalov|V. P. Chkalov]] and A. F. Anisimov. Vakhmistrov himself flew in the front gunner's turret.
;Zveno-1a
:TB-1 and two [[Polikarpov I-5]] on of the wings, first flight September 1933. The TB-1 was piloted by [[Petr Mikhailovich Stefanovskiy|Stefanovskiy]], the I-5s were piloted by Kokkinaki and Grozd.
;Zveno-2
:[[Tupolev TB-3]] and three I-5, the third aircraft was attached over the fuselage. First flight August 1934. The TB-3 was piloted by Zalevskiy, the I-5s were piloted by Altynov, Suprun, and Suzi.
;Zveno-3
:TB-3 and two [[Grigorovich I-Z]] under the wings.
;Zveno-5
:TB-3 and a single I-Z under the fuselage which attached and detached in the air as there was not enough ground clearance for the fighter. On [[23 March]] [[1935]], TB-3 piloted by Stefanovskiy and I-Z with Stepanchenok at the controls performed the world's first mid-air docking between two aircraft.
;Zveno-6
:TB-3 and two [[Polikarpov I-16]] which were attached on the ground with the landing gear retracted. First flight August 1935, with the TB-3 piloted by Stefanovskiy, and the I-16s piloted by Budakov and Nikashin.
;Zveno-7
:TB-3 and three I-16s, all docked in the air. First flight November 1939, pilots Stefanovskiy, Nyukhtikov, and Suprun.
;Aviamatka (Airborne mothership)
:TB-3 with two I-16s under the wings, two I-5s on top of the wings, and one I-Z attached under the fuselage in mid-air. First flight [[20 November]] [[1935]]. The TB-3 was piloted by Zalevskiy, the fighters piloted by Stefanovskiy, Nikashin, Altynov, Suprun, and Stepanchenok. Vakhmistrov also worked on a larger Aviamatka with eight I-16s. In this scheme, the TB-3 would get airborne with two I-16s under the wings and the remaining six would attach in the air. These six aircraft could also refuel from the mothership. Although a few successful mid-air dockings and fuel transfers were performed in 1938, the eight-fighter configuration was never completed.<ref name="ivanov"/>
;SPB (Sostavnoi Pikiruyuschiy Bombardirovschik - Combined Dive Bomber)
:TB-3-4AM-34FRN and two I-16s under the wings, each armed with a pair of 250 kg (550 lb) FAB-250 bombs. Used operationally in World War II with good success.

==Operational history==
[[image:Zveno-SPB.jpg|thumb|Zveno-SPB: TB-3-4M-34FRN with two [[Polikarpov I-16]]s armed with FAB-250 bombs]]

In 1938, Vakhmistrov devised '''Zveno-SPB''' (SPB: Sostavnoi Pikiruyuschiy Bombardirovschik, Combined Dive Bomber) which consisted of a [[Tupolev TB-3|Tupolev TB-3-4AM-34FRN]] mothership and two [[Polikarpov I-16|Polikarpov I-16 Type 5]] fighters. Each of the fighters was armed with a pair of 250 kg (550 lb) FAB-250 high-explosive bombs.<ref name="shavrov"/> Although an I-16 Type 5 could get airborne on its own with no more than 100 kg (220 lb) of bombs,<ref name="shavrov"/> once hoisted in the air by the TB-3 it could reach 410 km/h (220 knots, 255 mph) at 2500 m (8,200 ft), had a service ceiling of 6800 m (22,310 ft), and could dive at up to 650 km/h (350 knots, 405 mph).<ref name="ivanov"/> Once the bombs were dropped, the SPB-launched I-16s performed like conventional Type 5s. The three-aircraft Zveno-SPB had a total takeoff weight of 22000 kg (48,500 lb), a top speed of 268 km/h (145 knots, 165 mph),<ref name="shavrov"/> and a range of 2500 km (1,350 NM, 1,550 mi).<ref name="ivanov"/> The use of a mothership increased the range of the I-16s by 80%.<ref name="ivanov"/>

The SPB first flew in July 1937, with TB-3 piloted by Stefanovskiy, and I-16s piloted by Nikolayev and Taborovskiy.<ref name="shavrov"/> Following the successful test program in 1938, Zveno-SPB was accepted into service. By [[1 February]] [[1940]], [[Soviet Air Force]] was supposed to receive 20 TB-3s and 40 I-16s, with the same number going to the [[Soviet Navy]].<ref name="ivanov"/> Vakhmistrov was also asked to investigate the possibility of using [[Petlyakov Pe-8|Tupolev TB-7]], [[Tupolev MTB-2]], and [[PBY Catalina|GST (PBY Catalina)]] as the motherships, as well as arming I-16s with 500 kg (1,100 lb) bombs.<ref name="ivanov"/> By 1939, the government support for the project had waned, the Navy canceled all of its orders, and the Air Force reduced the number of fighters from 40 to 12.<ref name="ivanov"/> However, Soviet military observers noted the success of the [[Luftwaffe]] [[Junkers Ju 87]] [[dive bomber]]s in the opening stages of [[World War II]]. As the Soviet Union had no dive bombers, it was decided to resume low-scale work on the Zveno-SPB.<ref name="ivanov"/> Testing of the first production Zveno began in June 1940. It differed from the prototype in using the much more powerful I-16 Type 24 fighters.<ref name="ivanov"/> A total of six mothership-fighter combinations (six TB-3s and twelve modified I-16 Type 24s) were completed. All were attached to the 2nd Special Squadron of the 32nd IAP (Fighter Regiment) of the 62nd Aviation Brigade of the [[Black Sea Fleet]] Air Force stationed in [[Eupatoria]].<ref name="ivanov"/> Mirroring the nickname of the Zveno experiments, the squadron was dubbed ''Shubikov's Circus'' (Цирк Шубикова) after its commander Arseniy Shubikov.<ref name="ivanov"/> 

Zveno-SPB saw limited but successful combat use during the [[Great Patriotic War]]. In the opening stages, the Black Sea Fleet Air Force was tasked with destroying industrial targets in [[Nazi Germany]]-allied [[Romania]]. The most important of these was the [[King Carol I Bridge]] over [[Danube]] which carried the [[Ploieşti]]-[[Constanţa]] [[pipeline transport|oil pipeline]]. After several failed attempts to destroy the heavily protected bridge with conventional bombers, the task was given to the Zveno squadron. As a combat test, it was decided to first attack the Constanţa [[oil depot]]. On [[26 July]] [[1941]], two Zveno-SPB aircraft performed a successful attack on the depot in broad daylight with no losses. The fighters disconnected 40 km (22 NM, 25 mi) from the target and returned to the home airfield under their own power.<ref name="ivanov"/>

The first of the two bridge raids took place on [[10 August]] [[1941]]. For this mission, the I-16s were fitted with additional 95-liter (25 US gal) underwing fuel tanks for an additional 35 minutes of flight time.<ref name="ivanov"/> Of the three Zveno-SPBs, one had to turn back due to mechanical problems. The other two launched their fighters 15 km (8 NM, 9 mi) from the Romanian coastline. The fighters successfully dive-bombed from the altitude of 1800 m (5,900 ft) and returned home with no losses despite heavy anti-aircraft fire.<ref name="ivanov"/> The second raid took place on [[13 August]] [[1941]]. This time, all three Zveno-SPBs reached the target. The six fighters scored five direct hits on the bridge and completely destroyed one of the [[span (architecture)|spans]].<ref name="ivanov"/> On the way back, the fighters strafed Romanian infantry near [[Sulina]] and returned to Eupatoria with no losses. Following the successful sorties, two additional Zveno-SPB were brought to operational status, bringing the total to five. The main limiting factor was the lack of high-output [[Mikulin AM-34]]FRN engines, as the other versions were not powerful enough to get the aircraft airborne.<ref name="ivanov"/> On [[16 August]] [[1941]], [[Nikolai Gerasimovich Kuznetsov|Admiral Kuznetsov]] asked [[Joseph Stalin]] for additional AM-34FRN-engined TB-3s from the Air Force so they could be converted to Zveno-SPB carriers, but the request was denied as the Air Force had suffered heavy losses in the opening days of the war.<ref name="ivanov"/> In the meantime, the five aircraft continued flying operational sorties, destroying a [[dry dock]] in Constanţa on [[17 August]] and a bridge across the [[Dnieper River]] on [[28 August]], losing one I-16 in the process.<ref name="ivanov"/> During the repeat attack the next day, four Zveno-launched I-16s engaged several [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]s, shooting down two.<ref name="ivanov"/> Despite the high success rate, Zveno missions ended by 1942 due to high vulnerability of the obsolete TB-3s and I-16s in the face of enemy air superiority. It is estimated that Zveno-SPB flew at least 30 combat missions.<ref name="ivanov"/>
