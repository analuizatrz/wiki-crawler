{{Final Fantasy locations}}
{{nihongo|'''Ivalice'''|イヴァリース|Ivarīsu}} is a fictional location in the [[Square Enix]] [[Console role-playing game|role-playing games]] ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]'', ''[[Vagrant Story]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics Advance]]'', and ''[[Final Fantasy XII]]''. It is a world which its creator [[Yasumi Matsuno]] envisioned since he joined the game company Square in 1995. Ivalice is described as a complex world with a very long history, and in which the settings for the stories of ''Vagrant Story'', ''Final Fantasy Tactics'', and ''Final Fantasy XII'' unfold quite close on the Ivalice world map.<ref>[http://www.ffworld.com/?rub=ff12&page=interview_jp-mai04 Interview - Yasumi Matsuno]</ref>

==Background==
[[Image:Ivalice-time.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The timeline of ''Final Fantasy XII'' as compared to ''Final Fantasy Tactics''.]]
Ivalice makes an appearance in four Square Enix games; a major first in ''Final Fantasy Tactics'' then in ''Final Fantasy Tactics Advance'' and most recently in ''Final Fantasy XII'', and a minor in one game (''Vagrant Story''). This fictional world was created by Yasumi Matsuno with its own identity; a medieval-like world where magic and machine exist together; with usual elements of ''Final Fantasy'' blended into its setting. 

Ivalice in all the described games share some common features. For example, the religion of Kiltia is predominantly mentioned in ''Final Fantasy XII'' and ''Vagrant Story''. Ivalice in each four games also contain distinct differences to make one story unique from the other, such with the lore in each game; the Zodiac Brave Story of ''Final Fantasy Tactics'' and the legend of Kiltia in ''Vagrant Story''. While technically the same world as ''Final Fantasy Tactics'', developers of ''Final Fantasy XII'' created a different version of Ivalice for ''Final Fantasy XII''. <ref>[http://ps2.ign.com/articles/441/441293p1.html IGN Interview: ''Final Fantasy XII'' Q&A]</ref> The Ivalice of ''Tactics Advance'', however, is a fictional world inspired from Ivalice, created from a magical book.

The connections between the games' Ivalice has been quite vague, in which Matsuno himself had never revealed. A few venerable sources have made their own conclusion on the timeline of Ivalice.<ref name=GameSpot>{{cite web | author=Matthew Rorie|date=2006-09-23| title=TGS 06: ''Final Fantasy XII'' Q&A| work=[[GameSpot]] |url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/rpg/finalfantasy12/news.html?sid=6158485 | accessdate=2006-11-10}}</ref><ref>[http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=7630629&publicUserId=5624991 ''Final Fantasy XII'' Review]</ref> The ''Final Fantasy XII'' Ultimania Omega, part of the series of [[Ultimania]] books published by Square Enix dedicated to explaining game elements, placed the events of ''Final Fantasy XII'' to happen before ''Final Fantasy Tactics''. 
However, it should be noted that some aspects of the timeline contradict each other, namely those around Saint Ajora, who was executed 1200 years prior to the events of ''Final Fantasy Tactics''<ref name="ajora">Born around twelve centuries ago in Bervenia of Lesalia.  Raised in Milodos.  Spoke of the arrival of a kingdom of a higher source, as feelings of anitpathy grew from Father Fara.  Executed as a traitor by the Holy Empire of Yudora.  Soon after, the capital of the Church of Fara became submerged under the sea by an extraordinary natural phenomenon.  Those disciples of Ajora believed this was his miracle.  As these stories spread, the Glabados Church became what it is today.{{cite video game|title=[[Final Fantasy Tactics]] |developer=[[Squaresoft Inc]] |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref>, yet in the Clan Primer of ''Final Fantasy XII'' is said to have separated from the Light of Kiltia religion shortly after its foundation, already two thousand years old. <ref name="magickpot">Magick Pot Bestiary entry (2)<br>"The Light of Kiltia - Religion begun by the prophet Kiltia over two millennia ago. The religion of the Ordalian people is a dualist system--a polytheistic pantheon with the God of Light, Faram the Father, at its head. After embarking on a pilgrimage to proselytize and deliver the word of the vision he had seen to the people, Kiltia came to Mt Bur-Omisace, and from there his teachings spread. The Light of Kiltia, as his teachings were called, continued even after his death, until they covered all Ivalice. Though the followers and churches of Kiltia are spread far and wide, they do not interfere in affairs of state or governance. Though at one point the church held considerable influence, they willingly discarded that power, fearing oppression. Ever since, the church officials with the rank of celebrant or higher have been forbidden from participating in statecraft. In addition, Mt. Bur-Omisace maintains a mutual non-incursion policy with the surrounding territories. Several years after Kiltia's founding, Saint Ajora began a new teaching, claiming that Faram alone was the one true god, the popularity of this new sect further lessening the power of the Light."<br>{{cite video game|title=[[Final Fantasy XII]] |developer=[[Square Enix]] |date=2006-10-10 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> While no gender is specified in the North American release, in both the Japanese Clan Primer and the Ultimania timeline, Ajora's title of Saint in ''Final Fantasy XII'' is feminine, and the Ajora of ''Final Fantasy Tactics'' is male. This has lead to speculation that the Ajora mentioned in ''Final Fantasy XII'' is female, yet the timeline still questions if they are one and the same. To further the confusion, in the PSP port of ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics Shishi Sensō]]'' it is said Balthier will have an important role in the game and is believed to be searching for "the cache of Glabados", which he mentions at the end of ''Final Fantasy XII'', but the Glabados Church had yet to be established. 

In December 2006, Square Enix announced that three games set in the world of Ivalice, ''[[Final Fantasy XII Revenant Wings]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics A2 Fūketsu no Grimoire]]'', and a remake of ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]'' named ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics Shishi Sensō]]'', will be released as part of the "''[[Ivalice Alliance]]''" project.<ref>{{cite web | author=IGN Staff |date=2006-12-13 | title=''Final Fantasy Tactics'' Returns | work=[[IGN]] | url=http://uk.psp.ign.com/articles/750/750839p1.html | accessdate=2006-12-15}}</ref>

==''Final Fantasy Tactics''==
[[Image:FFTIvalice.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ivalice in ''Final Fantasy Tactics''.]]
In ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]'', Ivalice is either referred to as an [[empire]] or as a [[kingdom]], in which the story takes place. The setting for Ivalice in ''Final Fantasy Tactics'' is similar to [[Europe]] during the [[Middle Ages]]. It is a feudal society, with there being only one major religion, the Glabados Church, of which all Ivalicians are members, mirroring pre-[[Protestant Reformation|reformation]] [[Christianity|Christian]] Europe. 

Ivalice had recently suffered a series of wars that also involved the invasion of neighboring kingdoms of Ordalia and Romanda. The ''Fifty Year War'' in which Ivalice opposes the armies of Ordalia and Romanda takes place before the game which has led to the current destabilized political situation, and ''The Lion War'', which serves as the main plot of the game.

The Kingdom of Ivalice is composed of seven provinces: Gallione, Lionel, Lesalia, Fovoham, Limberry, Zeltennia and Murond.

At the western end of the kingdom, the province of '''Gallione''' is ruled by [[List of Final Fantasy Tactics characters#Prince Bestrada Larg|Prince Bestrada Larg]]. Igros Castle, capital of the province, is home to the Hokuten Knights and [[List of Final Fantasy Tactics characters#Ramza Beoulve|Ramza Beoulve]]'s family. The Royal Academy of Magic is located in the Magic City Gariland. [[Races of Final Fantasy#Moogles|Moogles]] once lived in Sweegy Woods before going extinct.

The ecclesiastical province of '''Lionel''' is located on a peninsula on the southern part of the kingdom. It is the place where [[List of Final Fantasy Tactics characters#Saint Ajora Glabados / Altima|Saint Ajora]] was executed twelve centuries before the events of the game. [[List of Final Fantasy Tactics characters#Cardinal Alphons Draclau / Queklain|Cardinal Alphons Draclau]], second in the Glabados Church, rules this province. Many ruins of an ancient, advanced civilization are excavated in the undergrounds of the insular Goug Machine City. An abandoned lighthouse in the East Bugross Sea leads to the mysterious Deep Dungeon.

The Imperial province of '''Lesalia''', located on the central region of the kingdom, houses the capital Lesalia and the royal family Atkascha. It is a highland presenting several hills and plateaus, as well as the largest active volcano in the kingdom. The city of Bervenia, though located in this province, is governed by the Murond Glabados Church as it was the birthplace of Saint Ajora.

The province of '''Fovoham''' is located at the northernmost part of the kingdom. Its capital is Riovanes Castle, home to [[List of Final Fantasy Tactics characters#Grand Duke Gelkanis Barinten|Grand Duke Gelkanis Barinten]]. The country of Romanda is located northwest of Fovoham, across the Larner Channel.

The province of '''Limberry''' is located on the southeastern part of the kingdom. It is ruled by [[List of Final Fantasy Tactics characters#Marquis Mesdoram Elmdor / Zalera|Marquis Mesdoram Elmdor]]. It is essentially a lowland of swamps and lakes.

At the eastern end of the kingdom, the province of '''Zeltennia''' is ruled by [[List of Final Fantasy Tactics characters#Prince Druksmald Goltana|Prince Druksmald Goltana]]. It is home to the Nanten Knights led by [[List of Final Fantasy Tactics characters#Cidolfas Orlandu|Cidolfas Orlandu]]. The province presents mountainous landscapes. The country of Ordalia, rival to the kingdom of Ivalice, is located east of Zeltennia.

The ecclesiastical province of '''Murond''' is located south of Gallione, on a small island of the Black Coral Sea. It is the center of the Glabados Church and is directly ruled by High Priest Marge Funeral. The province was larger in the past but most of it was submerged by a disaster after the execution of Saint Ajora. A remaining passage leading to Murond Death City was subsequently sealed in the undergrounds of the Orbonne Monastery.

== ''Final Fantasy Tactics Advance'' ==
In ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics Advance]]'', Ivalice is a world created when four ordinary children; [[Final Fantasy Tactics Advance#Marche Radiuju|Marche Radiuju]], [[Final Fantasy Tactics Advance#Mewt Randell|Mewt Randell]], [[Final Fantasy Tactics Advance#Ritz Malheur|Ritz Malheur]], and [[Final Fantasy Tactics Advance#Doned Radiuju|Doned Radiuju]] come across a dusty, old, and rather large book which Mewt purchases at his local used bookstore. Unaware that the book is the legendary Gran Grimoire with the power to change the world as its readers desires, the children transformed their hometown of St. Ivalice into an Ivalice of a ''Final Fantasy'' game. 

The setting of ''Final Fantasy Tactics Advance'' is similiar to [[pre-industrial]] [[Arabia]], with the architecture and culture mirroring ninth century [[Islam|Islamic]] [[Middle East]]. Other than humans, four other races make Ivalice their home -- [[Moogles]], [[Races of Final Fantasy#Bangaa|Bangaa]], [[Races of Final Fantasy#Viera|Viera]], and [[Races of Final Fantasy#Nu Mou|Nu Mou]]. The geography of Ivalice revolve around plains, mountains, deserts, forests, and swamps, and also introduces areas called jagds; lawless slums where no Judges dare to tread. Jagd is a German word which means 'the hunt'. Jagds are the only places in the game in which a character can die; everywhere else, they are protected from death by the judges and are simply knocked out.

Laws of Ivalice are enforced by a group of judges who set a forever changing, seemingly arbitrary "laws" that dictate what may and may not be done in battle.  Although they are the object of intense enmity, the citizens of Ivalice nonetheless obey the judges out of fear of persecution or imprisonment. There are rumors, however, of a growing underground resistance movement which is reportedly spearheading a rebellion.  Above the judges, the country is ruled by [[Final Fantasy Tactics Advance#Queen Remedi|Queen Remedi]], and her son, [[Mewt Randell|Prince Mewt]].

The placement of location symbols on the world map after each story-related misson and certain other missions is controlled completely by the player, and there are potentially thousands of world map configurations varying by player. The "Treasure Hunting" system is deeply linked to location placement, and can sometimes result in items that cannot be found any other way. Four locations in the game always have default placement — Giza Plains, Cyril, Bervenia Palace, and Ambervale.

[[Image:Ivalice (FF12).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ivalice in ''Final Fantasy XII'']]
In ''[[Final Fantasy XII]]'', Ivalice is a region<ref name="ivalice"> Sage Knowledge 29 of 78 (Sleipnir Bestiary entry){{cite video game|title=[[Final Fantasy XII]] |developer=[[Square Enix]] |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> consisting of three continents; Ordalia in the west, Valendia in the northeast and Kerwon in the south, and other smaller continents such as the ''Purvama'' (Floating Lands) in the east. In ancient times, King Raithwall, a noble Hume from the lands of Valendia, united the continents to create the Galtean Alliance.<ref> Sage Knowledge 2 of 78 (Lost Soul Bestiary entry) {{cite video game|title=[[Final Fantasy XII]] |developer=[[Square Enix]] |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref>  As time passed, conflicts had split the continents again. Many races populate the world of Ivalice; this include [[Races of Final Fantasy#Humans|Humes]], [[Races of Final Fantasy#Viera|Vieras]], [[Races of Final Fantasy#Bangaa|Bangaas]], [[Races of Final Fantasy#Moogle|Moogles]], [[Races of Final Fantasy#Seeq|Seeqs]], [[Races of Final Fantasy#Garif|Garif]], [[Races of Final Fantasy#Urutan-Yensa|Urutan-Yensa]], [[Races of Final Fantasy#Nu Mou|Nu Mous]], [[Races of Final Fantasy#Baknamy|Baknamy]], [[Races of Final Fantasy#Rebe|Rebes]] and [[Races of Final Fantasy#Helgas|Helgas]].

;Continents
*'''Ordalia''' - Continent on the western edge of Ivalice. The vast plains in the interior are home to the great Rozarrian Empire. To the east of Rozarria the land is arid and largely desert. The Galtean Peninsula on the eastern portion of the continent is a crossroads connecting to Valendia and Kerwon both, and a strategic prize sought by empire and kingdom alike. Though Dalmasca has controlled the peninsula for the last several hundred years, it was lost to the Archadian Empire in an invasion two years past.<ref> Sage Knowledge 30 of 78 (Urstrix Bestiary entry) {{cite video game|title=[[Final Fantasy XII]] |developer=[[Square Enix]] |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> 

*'''Valendia''' - Continent lying to the northeast of Ordalia. The climate is overall quite clement, and levels of Mist are far more stable than on the other two large continents. Many towns and villages dot the hilly region stretching from the continent's interior to the shores of the Inner Naldoan Sea, most under the direct control of Archadia. The Kingdom of Nabradia, lying on the Phon Straits in western Valendia, prospered here until its destruction in the Archadian invasion of two years past, its capital of Nabudis becoming a deserted wasteland.<ref> Sage Knowledge 31 of 78 (Striker Bestiary entry) {{cite video game|title=[[Final Fantasy XII]] |developer=[[Square Enix]] |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> 

*'''Kerwon''' - Largely forested continent lying to the southeast of Ordalia. Climate varies greatly by region, and many less hospitable areas are uninhabited. In the west of Kerwon dwell the Garif, in the wooded north dwell the Viera, both living in peace, apparently unaffected by the expansionist hunger which has so dominated hume history. Though the hume presence is strong on the other continents, in Kerwon they can only be found in the eastern highlands, on the slopes of the holy mountain of Kiltia, Bur-Omisace. <ref> Sage Knowledge 32 of 78 (Hellhound Bestiary entry) {{cite video game|title=[[Final Fantasy XII]] |developer=[[Square Enix]] |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> 

*'''Purvama''' - A great landmass, floating in the skies above the Naldoan Sea. Such landmasses are not uncommon, found throughout Ivalice in every sort and size, though the manner of their formation remains a mystery. The region in which they float has some bearing on their climate, however most are warm to subtropical, boasting primordial jungles in which flora and fauna both rare and wonderful can be seen. The crust of these floating islands boasts a high magicite concentration, and after airships became a common mode of transport, mining colonies sprung up on the richest outcrops. Bhjuerba, in Dorstonis, is the largest of the skycities, and oversees the administration of many of the rest.<ref> Sage Knowledge 33 of 78 (Dullahan Bestiary entry) {{cite video game|title=[[Final Fantasy XII]] |developer=[[Square Enix]] |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> 

;Nations

*'''The Archadian Empire''' - The mightiest sovereign state in Valendia. Originally a republic governed by an active senate, the rise of the military brought about the shift to an imperial system 200 years ago. With the change in governance, Archadia began invading its neighboring lands, quickly becoming the largest realm in Ivalice. While in the past the emperor was traditionally of military extraction, a purge of key figures in the military by the politically powerful House Solidor led to the installation of a line of Solidor emperors which continues to this day.<ref> Sage Knowledge 36 of 78 (Reaper Bestiary entry) {{cite video game|title=[[Final Fantasy XII]] |developer=[[Square Enix]] |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> 

*'''Bhujerba''' - An autonomous city-state found on the sky continent of Dorstonis. Originally formed as a magicite mining colony with the advent of airship travel. The magicite mines of the skylands are superior to crystal mines on the surface in both quantity and quality of ore, and Bhujerba developed quickly on fortunes born of rock. During the years of the Galtean Alliance, the Ondore family took over much of the daily business of Bhujerba's governance, a rule which cotninues to this day. Their neutral stance during the Archadian invasion two years ago positioned them as mediators of the peace negotiations that followed. Like much of Dorstonis, Bhujerba is a city of hills and sloping boulevards. Merchant houses and shops are clustered near the peaks, while residences are found in the valleys. At the very bottom of the hills lies the network of crystalline shafts known as the Lhusu Mines. Many visitors come to Bhujerba to enjoy the open-air parks with spectacular views only available to those who live in the sky. Very rarely does anyone fall from the skycity, and curiously enough, not a single death has been reported to have resulted from such an occurrence to date.<ref> Sage Knowledge 53 of 78 (Headless Bestiary entry) {{cite video game|title=[[Final Fantasy XII]] |developer=[[Square Enix]] |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> 

*'''The Kingdom of Dalmasca''' - A small kingdom comprising the lands around the city of Rabanastre, governing a portion of the Galtean Peninsula. While its territories are small, its situation at the crossroads of three continents has enabled it to prosper as a center for trade. More than 700 years are marked in the charts of history since her founding, yet many are the armies that have sought to claim her for her cultural richness and strategic importance. Upon her defeat to Archadia in the invasion of 704, her lands were placed under the direct control of the Empire.<ref> Sage Knowledge 34 of 78 (Icthon Bestiary entry) {{cite video game|title=[[Final Fantasy XII]] |developer=[[Square Enix]] |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> 

*'''The Kingdom of Nabradia''' - A land neighboring Dalmasca, both kingdoms being founded by the bloodline of the Dynast-King, who first unified Ivalice under one rule. Graced with beautiful landscapes and rich natural resources, Nabradia prospered for many years as a center of both agriculture and industry. Two years ago, an internal struggle boiled over into civil war, this opening the door to the Archadian invasion of Nabradia. Several days after the beginning of the siege of Nabudis, a mysterious explosion consumed the city, leaving a smoking ruin where the political and cultural heart of Nabradia once stood, and sounding the death-knell for the kingdom.<ref> Sage Knowledge 35 of 78 (Dark Elemental Bestiary entry) {{cite video game|title=[[Final Fantasy XII]] |developer=[[Square Enix]] |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> 

*'''The Rozarrian Empire''' - Empire located in the west of Ordalia, possessing an army rumored to be the equal of the Archadian Imperial forces. Though an emperor rules, Rozarria is a military state, and the armed forces carry much political power. In recent years, the Margrace Imperial family has sought to limit the military’s power, embarking on a series of reforms to restrict the scope of their authority. Archadia’s unprovoked invasion of Dalmasca sent shockwaves through the Rozarrian establishment, and many are those who see a war between empires looming on the horizon.<ref> Sage Knowledge 37 of 78 (Mom Bomb Bestiary entry) {{cite video game|title=[[Final Fantasy XII]] |developer=[[Square Enix]] |date=2006-10-31 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref>

[[Image:RWLemures.JPG|thumb|right|The ''Purvama'' Lemurés]]
A few locations in the Ivalice of ''Final Fantasy XII'' return in ''Final Fantasy XII Revenant Wings'', along with a new setting: Lemurés. A legendary ''Purvama'' (Floating Continent) raised into the skies by the god Falsanos long ago, this land is ruled by a magical stone known as the “Sacred Crystal” which erected a barrier to shield the Purvama from the rest of the world. In time, the “Legend of the Floating Land” became an ambition for Sky Pirates who seek the island and what riches are on it. The ruins of Lemurés are where the [[Races of Final Fantasy#Aegyl|Aegyl]] reside.

== ''Vagrant Story'' ==
[[Image:LeaMonde.jpg|thumb|right|Lea Monde]]
There is no mention of Ivalice in ''Vagrant Story''. However, there are references to Ivalice, for instance, the Kingdom of Valendia, the setting for ''[[Vagrant Story]]'', shares the same name as a continent of Ivalice in ''Final Fantasy XII''. The Kiltia religion of ''Final Fantasy XII'' was founded centuries before the events of ''Vagrant Story'' and have become an ancient and forgotten religion; all that is left are the ruins of its temple and the many ancient Kildean letterings scattered throughout the dead city of Lea Monde, along with secret magic arts of grimoires as well.<ref>[http://barhaven.casualvillain.com/Vagrant/VSScript/vsscript06.html ''Vagrant Story'' script - Town Center West]</ref> Also, a quotation from Alazlam J. Durai, a famous historian of Ivalice who lived 400 years after the Lion War (the narrator of the Zodiac Brave Story in ''Final Fantasy Tactics''), is used at the beginning of the game<ref>[http://barhaven.casualvillain.com/Vagrant/VSScript/vsscript01.html ''Vagrant Story'' script - Duke Bardorba’s Manor]</ref>.
