'''Johannes Rebmann''' ([[January 16]], [[1820]], [[Gerlingen]], [[Württemberg]] - [[October 4]], [[1876]], near [[Stuttgart]])<ref name="brit">{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9062886/Johannes-Rebmann|title=Encyclopaedia Brittanica|accessmonthday=11 April|accessyear=2007}}</ref>
was a German missionary and explorer, and is credited with feats including being the first European, along with his accomplice [[Johann Ludwig Krapf]], to enter [[Africa]] from the [[Indian Ocean]] coast, and they are both also credited with being the first Europeans to find [[Kilimanjaro]] and [[Mt. Kenya]]. <ref name="brit" />
Their work there is also thought to have had effects on future African expeditions by Europeans, including the exploits of [[Sir Richard Burton]], [[John Hanning Speke]], and [[David Livingstone]]. <ref name="brit" />

== Early life ==
Rebmann was born the son of a Swabian [[farmer]] in 1820. Later, when Rebmann became a young man, he chose to devote himself to being a missionary, and was trained in [[Basel]].<ref name="bio">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bautz.de/bbkl/r/rebmann_j.shtml|title=www.bautz.de|accessmonthday=13 April|accessyear=2007}}</ref><ref name="sta">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gerlingen.kdrs.de/servlet/PB/menu/1107813/index.html|title=Statd Gurlingen|accessmonthday=13 April|accessyear=2007}}</ref>
Coupled with fellow missionary Johann Ludwig Krapf, Rebmann traveled to [[East Africa]] in [[1846]], where he worked in areas around [[Kenya]], primarily [[Mombasa]], as well as at various other locations. <ref name="bio">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bautz.de/bbkl/r/rebmann_j.shtml|title=www.bautz.de|accessmonthday=13 April|accessyear=2007}}</ref>

== Discovering Kilimanjaro and Mt. Kenya ==
[[Image:Kibo summit of Mt Kilimanjaro 001.JPG|left|thumb|350px|Kibo Summit of Kilimanjaro, the mountain that Rebmann beheld snow upon]]
In 1848, the two missionaries found Kilimanjaro. The following year, they saw Mt. Kenya, and became the first two Europeans to see the two mountains respectively.<ref name="ntz">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ntz.info/gen/n00518.html|title=www.ntz.info|accessmonthday=11 April|accessyear=2007}}</ref>
On the [[16th October|16th of October]], [[1847]], the two men set out for the mountain of [[Kasigau]]. With them came eight tribesmen and a local caravan leader named Bwana Kheri. <ref name="ntz" />
This expedition was designed with the goal of establishing some of the first mission posts in the region. <ref name="ntz" />
The journey was successful, and the group of tribesmen and the missionaries returned to Mombasa on the [[27th of October]]. <ref name="ntz" />
Sometime during their journey or their stay in the region, Rebmann and Krapf learned of a great mountain referred to as 'Kilimansharo', who peaked the clouds and who was 'capped in [[silver]]'. <ref name="ntz" /> The two men, who, like most of Europe at the time, were under the impression that [[snow]] and [[ice]] could not exist so close to the equator, failed to realise at the time the significance of the mountain being 'topped with silver'. <ref name="ntz" />
However, the two missionaries, who both had become just as much explorers as they were missionaries, had become quite interested in Kilimansharo, and Krapf sought permission of the Mombasa [[governor]] for an expedition to the land of the Jagga, a people now known as the [[Chaga]], who lived and live on the actual slopes of Kilimanjaro. Krapf told the governor that this journey would be work-based. <ref name="ntz" />
Despite this, Krapf did not accompany Rebmann on the journey, so only Bwana Kheri and Rebmann left for Kilimanjaro on the [[27th April]], [[1848]]. <ref name="ntz" />
Within two weeks, Rebmann and his guide were within sight of the great mountain. He noted in his journal the strange white on the summit of Kilimanjaro, and he questioned his guide on what he thought it was. According to Rebmann's log, the guide 'did not know what it was, but supposed it was coldness'. <ref name="ntz" /> It was then that Rebmann realised that Kilimanjaro, even though it was located in a region that was thought impossible to bear snow or 'coldness', as the guide referred to it, was in fact capped in it. <ref name="ntz" />
On [[November 10th]], this is what was written in Rebmann's log:

{{cquote|This morning we discerned the Mountains of Jagga more distinctly than ever; and about ten o'clock I fancied I saw a dazzlingly white cloud. My Guide called the white which I saw merely 'Beredi,' cold; it was perfectly clear to me, however, that it could be nothing else but snow. <ref name="ntz" />
}}

In 1849, these observations were published, but the findings proved difficult to be accepted by the scientific [[community]]. <ref name="ntz" />

Mt. Kenya was found by Krapf in the next year, on [[December 3]], 1849. The finding of this mountain was also met with disbelief in Europe, but the impact of the both of these findings was enough to trigger further investigations into other areas of Africa, thereby stimulated a growth of scientific (among other fields) knowledge of the regions, people, history and geography of the African continent. <ref name="brit" />

== The Slug Map ==
[[Image:Slug map.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The Slug Map, illustrating some of the missionaries findings]]
During their time in Africa, Krapf and Rebmann worked their way into the interior of the continent. They traveled to several areas in the regions of Central and Eastern Africa, including to what is now known as the [[African Great Lakes]]. <ref name="ntz" /> The finding of one especially large lake is depicted in a [[map]] known as the 'Slug' map. It was known by this name because the layout of the water body suggested a shape similar to that of a [[slug]].
On the map, several subtle but interesting things can be discovered, including, in the extreme North east section of the cartograph, a reference to a stream flowing through [[Lake Victoria]], then known by the missionaries as "the Ukerewa".
A note is present describing how the waters of the stream were very sweet, but stained the teeth a sickly [[yellow]]. <ref name="ntz" /> This note is probably the first known text referring to the [[drinking water]], found primarily around and of [[Mount Meru (Tanzania)|Mount Meru]], that has a high content of [[fluorine]] and in fact does cause a yellow-[[brown]] stain to the incisors which cannot be removed. <ref name="ntz" />
Among other things, another piece of writing on the Slug Map -"From where the Magad [soda] is bought" - provides evidence that the soda [[trade]], the soda originating in [[Lake Natron]] (obviously not known by that name then), was active at that time in those regions of Africa in which the map depicts. <ref name="ntz" />
The Slug map, having never been published, is now in the care of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] in [[London]]. <ref name="ntz" />

The Slug Map was presented to the Royal Geographical Society in [[1855]] by Erhardt, a fellow missionary. The map is described as such by the society:

<br>{{cquote|Sketch of a Map from 1°N. to 15°S. Latitude and from 23° to 43°E. Longitude delineating the probably position and extent of the Sea of Uniamesi as being the continuation of the Lake Niasa and exhibiting the numerous heathen-tribes situated to the East and West of that great Inland-sea together with the Caravan routes leading to it and into the interior in general. In true accordance with the information received from natives - Representatives of various inland tribes - and Mahomidan inland traders. By the Revd. Messrs. Erhardt and F. Rebmann Missionaries of the Church Miss. Society in East Africa Kisaludini March 14 1855.}}</br><ref name="ntz" />

== Later life and death ==
Rebmann stayed in Africa until [[1875]], the year he went back to Europe. During his time there, after his expeditions to Kilimanjaro and around the Great lakes, he learned how to speak several native languages, as well as writing a [[dictionary]] in the [[Swahili]] language.
One year after his return to Europe, on [[4 October]] [[1876]], Rebmann died. <ref name="brit" />
The legacy that he left behind him is preserved by the Johannes Rebmann Foundation, a religious society devoted to Rebmann and his memory.
