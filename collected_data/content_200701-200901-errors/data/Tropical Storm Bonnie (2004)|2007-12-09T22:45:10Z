'''Tropical Storm Bonnie''' was a small [[Tropical cyclone#Intensity classifications|tropical storm]] that made landfall on [[Florida]] in August 2004. Bonnie, the second storm of the season, developed from a [[tropical wave]] on [[August 3]] to the east of the [[Lesser Antilles]]. After moving through the islands, its fast forward motion caused it to dissipate; however, it later regenerated into a tropical storm near the [[Yucatán Peninsula]]. Bonnie reached peak winds of 65&nbsp;mph (105&nbsp;km/h) over the [[Gulf of Mexico]], turned to the northeast, and hit Florida as a 45&nbsp;mph (70&nbsp;km) tropical storm. The storm accelerated to the northeast and became an [[extratropical cyclone]] to the east of [[New Jersey]]. Bonnie was the first of five tropical systems to make landfall on Florida in the [[2004 Atlantic hurricane season]], and the second of a record eight disturbances to reach tropical storm strength during the month of August.<ref name="augrec">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|year=2004|title=August 2004 Monthly Tropical Weather Summary|accessmonthday=May 18 |accessyear=2004|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2004/tws/MIATWSAT_aug.shtml?}}</ref> 

Bonnie's impact was minimal. Throughout the [[Caribbean Sea]], the storm mainly caused light rainfall; and in Florida, rainfall caused [[flood]]ing and minor damage. The tropical storm caused a tornado outbreak across the [[Southeastern United States]], killing three and causing over $1&nbsp;million (2004&nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD]]) in damage. Bonnie is most notable for making [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] on Florida the day before [[Hurricane Charley]] struck.

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Bonnie 2004 track.png}}
A tropical wave left the coast of [[Africa]] on [[July 29]] and entered the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. It moved westward, attaining [[convection]] and a mid-level circulation. Convection steadily increased, and, upon the development of a low-level circulation center, the system organized into Tropical Depression Two on [[August 3]] while 415&nbsp;miles (670&nbsp;km) east of [[Barbados]]. It moved rapidly westward at speeds of up to 23&nbsp;mph (37&nbsp;km/h); after crossing through the Lesser Antilles on [[August 4]], it degenerated back into a tropical wave.<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|year=2004|title=Tropical Storm Bonnie Tropical Cyclone Report|accessmonthday=May 18 |accessyear=2006|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2004bonnie.shtml}}</ref>

The tropical wave continued to move rapidly to the west-northwest, until it reached the western Caribbean Sea. While south of [[Cuba]], the system slowed down to regenerate convection, and it re-developed into a tropical depression on [[August 8]].<ref name="tcr"/> Operationally, the system was classified a tropical wave until a day later.<ref name="bondis7">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|year=2004|title=Tropical Storm Bonnie Tropical Discussion #7|accessmonthday=May 18 |accessyear=2006|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2004/dis/al022004.discus.007.shtml?}}</ref> The depression moved through the [[Yucatán Channel]], and intensified into Tropical Storm Bonnie on [[August 9]] while 70&nbsp;miles (115&nbsp;km) north of the Yucatán Peninsula.<ref name="tcr"/>

Bonnie continued to the west-northwest; late on [[August 9]], the storm presented a 9-mile (15-km) wide [[Eye (cyclone)|eyewall]], a very unusual occurrence in a small and weak tropical storm.<ref name="bondis8">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|year=2004|title=Tropical Storm Bonnie Tropical Discussion #8|accessmonthday=May 18 |accessyear=2006|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2004/dis/al022004.discus.008.shtml?}}</ref> Bonnie quickly strengthened while turning to the north, a directional shift caused by a break in the [[Ridge (meteorology)|mid-level ridge]].<ref name="bondis10">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|year=2004|title=Tropical Storm Bonnie Tropical Discussion #10|accessmonthday=May 18 |accessyear=2006|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2004/dis/al022004.discus.010.shtml?}}</ref> The storm briefly weakened late on [[August 10]]; it re-strengthened again the following day to attain a peak intensity of 65&nbsp;mph (105&nbsp;km/h). Soon after, strong southwesterly [[wind shear]] disrupted the storm, causing Bonnie to weaken again. On [[August 12]], Bonnie made landfall just south of [[Apalachicola, Florida|Apalachicola]] as a 45&nbsp;mph (70&nbsp;km/h) tropical storm. It quickly weakened to a tropical depression, and accelerated northeastward through the southeastern [[United States]]. After paralleling the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[South Carolina]], and [[North Carolina]] coastlines, Bonnie lost its tropical characteristics on [[August 14]] to the east of New Jersey.<ref name="tcr"/> Its remnant low continued northeastward, making landfall in [[Massachusetts]] and [[Maine]] and continuing into [[Atlantic Canada]].<ref name="raintot">{{cite web|author=Hydrometeorological Prediction Center|year=2006|title=Rainfall Summary for Tropical Storm Bonnie|accessmonthday=May 18 |accessyear=2006|url=http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/rain/bonnie2004.html}}</ref>

==Preparations==
16 hours before the storm moved through the Lesser Antilles, the government of [[Saint Lucia]] issued a [[Tropical cyclone warnings and watches|tropical storm warning]]. [[Guadeloupe]], [[Martinique]], [[Dominica]], [[St. Maarten]], [[Saba]], [[St. Eustatius]], [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S Virgin Islands]] issued tropical storm watches.<ref name="tcr"/>

In combination with the threat of Hurricane Charley, Bonnie forced the evacuation of 154&nbsp;[[oil platforms]] and 32&nbsp;[[oil rigs]]. The stoppage of production was equivalent to over 1.2&nbsp;million barrels of [[crude oil]], or 0.2% of the annual oil production in the Gulf of Mexico. [[Natural gas]] reserves were also limited. The lack of gas production due to the storms was equivalent to 7.4% of the total daily production in the Gulf of Mexico.<ref name="gasstop">{{cite web|author=United States Department of the Interior|year=2004|title=Tropical Storm Bonnie and Hurricane Charley Evacuation and Production Shut-in Statistics|accessmonthday=May 18 |accessyear=2006|url=http://www.gomr.mms.gov/homepg/whatsnew/newsreal/2004/040813.html}}</ref>

Early forecasts for Bonnie indicated that the storm might make landfall as an 80&nbsp;mph (130&nbsp;km/h) [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 1 hurricane]].<ref name="bondis10"/> In response to the threat, fifteen shelters in seven northwestern Florida counties were put on standby.<ref name="shelter">{{cite web|author=Capital City Area Red Cross|year=2004|title=Tropical Storm Bonnie Situation Report #1|accessmonthday=May 18 |accessyear=2006|url=http://www.tallytown.com/redcross/situation/bonnie-csr-01.pdf}}</ref> In the hours before landfall, two shelters were opened, four were put on standby, and health and cleanup teams were deployed to the area.<ref name="shelter5">{{cite web|author=Capital City Area Red Cross|year=2004|title=Tropical Storm Bonnie Situation Report #1|accessmonthday=May 18 |accessyear=2006|url=http://www.tallytown.com/redcross/situation/bonnie-csr-05.pdf}}</ref> Parts of [[Gadsden County, Florida|Gadsden]], [[Wakulla County, Florida|Wakulla]], and [[Levy County, Florida|Levy Counties]] issued voluntary evacuations, and numerous schools were closed.

==Impact==
Bonnie was a weak storm through most of its path, dropping only light rainfall and causing minimal damage. South Carolina and North Carolina experienced the worst of the storm, where a tornado outbreak killed three people and caused moderate damage. 

===Caribbean Sea===
While traversing the Lesser Antilles as a tropical depression, Bonnie was moving very rapidly; consequently, most islands only experienced minor effects. For example, Saint Lucia received light and sporadic rainshowers, with sustained winds of 20 to 25&nbsp;mph (32 to 40&nbsp;km/h) and gusts to 35&nbsp;mph (55&nbsp;km/h).<ref name="stlucia">{{cite web|author=Mike Davis|year=2004|title=Unofficial Reports from St. Lucia|accessmonthday=May 18 |accessyear=2006|url=http://stormcarib.com/reports/2004/stlucia.shtml}}</ref> In [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], however, the depression dropped up to 9.2&nbsp;inches (235&nbsp;mm) of rain in 24 hours. The rainfall blocked storm drains, including those near the airport, which was forced to shut down. In addition, the rainfall caused debris to collect on roads throughout the island.<ref name="stvindam">{{cite web|author=National Emergency Office, St Vincent|year=2004|title=Airport in St Vincent temporarily closed due to flooding|accessmonthday=May 18 |accessyear=2006|url=http://www.cdera.org/cunews/sitrep/article_378.php}}</ref> Although the storm passed only 70&nbsp;miles (110&nbsp;km) north of the Yucatán Peninsula, Bonnie only 0.6&nbsp;inches (15&nbsp;mm) of rain due to its small size.<ref name="mexrain"">{{es icon}}{{cite web|author=Dir.

===North America===
[[Image:Bonnie2004rain.gif|thumb|200px|right|Rainfall totals of Tropical Storm Bonnie.]]
In Florida, Bonnie produced up to 4.1&nbsp;inches (104&nbsp;mm) of rainfall in [[Pace, Florida|Pace]], with peak wind gusts of 42&nbsp;mph (68&nbsp;km/h). Bonnie was accompanied by a four-foot [[storm surge]]; moderate wave action caused slight [[coastal erosion|beach erosion]]. Rainfall and storm surge flooded roads, forcing the evacuation of 2,000 residents in [[Taylor County, Florida|Taylor County]]. The winds downed trees and caused scattered power outages.<ref name="August 2004-2">{{cite web|author=World Meteorological Organization|year=2004|title=Storm data and unusual weather phenomena, August 2004 (Alabama-Florida)|accessmonthday=May 18 |accessyear=2006|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0QRF/is_8_46/ai_n9481380}}</ref> A [[tornado]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]] damaged several businesses and houses.<ref name="bontorn">{{cite web|author=Insurance Journal|year=2004|title=Storm Bonnie Spawns Tornadoes from Fla. to Va.|accessmonthday=May 18 |accessyear=2006|url=http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2004/08/13/44943.htm}}</ref>

Bonnie spawned a tornado outbreak across the Mid-Atlantic. One such tornado in [[Pender County, North Carolina]] destroyed 17&nbsp;homes and damaged 59&nbsp;houses, causing three deaths and $1.27&nbsp;million in damage (2004 USD).<ref name="wilnws">{{cite web|author=Wilmington National Weather Service|year=2004|title=Final Pender County Tornado Damage Assessment|accessdate=2006-05-22|url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/er/ilm/news/Pendertornadoweb.htm}}</ref> In [[Stella, North Carolina|Stella]], Bonnie generated a waterspout that struck a campground, damaged nine trailers, and wrecked small boats.<ref name="stellator">{{cite news|author=Timmi Toler|year=2004|title=Waterspout damages Stella campground|publisher=Jacksonville Daily News|accessdate=May 18|accessyear=2004|url=http://www.jacksonvilledailynews.com/SiteProcessor.cfm?Template=/GlobalTemplates/Details.cfm&StoryID=24768&Section=News}}</ref> A tornado in [[Richlands, North Carolina|Richlands]] damaged several houses as well.<ref name=richlandstor">{{cite news|author=Roselee Papandrea|year=2004|title=Bonnie makes presence felt|publisher=Jacksonville Daily News|accessdate=May 18|accessyear=2006|url=http://www.jacksonvilledailynews.com/SiteProcessor.cfm?Template=/GlobalTemplates/Details.cfm&StoryID=24776&Section=News}}</ref> In South Carolina, tornadoes across the state damaged nine homes. A suspected tornado in [[Danville, Virginia]] destroyed the roofs of several businesses.<ref name="bontorn"/> In South Carolina, rainfall peaking at 6.07&nbsp;inches (154&nbsp;mm) in [[Loris, South Carolina|Loris]]<ref name="raintot"/> caused flooding across the state. The flooding, including a one foot depth along [[U.S. Route 501]], washed away a road and a bridge in [[Greenville County, South Carolina|Greenville County]]. In addition, 600&nbsp;people across the state were left without electricity.<ref name="scdam">{{cite web|author=Associated Press|year=2004|title=Bonnie brings high winds, tornadoes around SC|accessmonthday=May 18 |accessyear=2006|url=http://www.wistv.com/Global/story.asp?S=2166556}}</ref>

In [[Pennsylvania]], the remnants of the storm dropped up to 8&nbsp;inches (200&nbsp;mm) of rain in [[Tannersville, Pennsylvania|Tannersville]]. The rainfall caused the [[Schuylkill River]] to reach a crest peak of 12.89&nbsp;[[Foot (unit of length)|ft]] (4 [[metre|m]]) at [[Berne, Pennsylvania|Berne]]. The flooding blocked several roads across eastern Pennsylvania. In addition, Bonnie produced gusty winds, leaving thousands without power from downed power lines.<ref name="August 2004">{{cite web|author=World Meteorological Organization|year=2004|title=Storm data and unusual weather phenomena, August 2004 (New York-Pennsylvania)|accessmonthday=May 19 |accessyear=2006|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0QRF/is_8_46/ai_n9481384}}</ref> In [[Delaware]], the storm dropped up to 4&nbsp;inches (100&nbsp;mm) of rain, forcing 100 to evacuate from the floodwaters. The flooding closed part of [[U.S. Route 13]], and an overflown creek in [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle County]] caused moderate flooding damage to stores.<ref name="August 2004-2"/> In Maine, moisture from the remnants of Bonnie produced heavy rainfall, with localized totals of up to 10&nbsp;inches (250&nbsp;mm). The rainfall flooded or washed out roads across the eastern portion of the state. In [[Aroostook County, Maine|Aroostook County]], near the town of [[St. Francis, Maine|St. Francis]], the rainfall caused a mudslide, narrowing a county road to one lane.<ref name="aug2004">{{cite web|author=World Meteorological Organization|year=2004|title=Storm data and unusual weather phenomena, August 2004 (Kansas-Michigan)|accessmonthday=May 18 |accessyear=2006|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0QRF/is_8_46/ai_n9481382}}</ref> 

Bonnie, as an extratropical low combined with a frontal system, continued to produce moderate rainfall in [[Canada]], peaking at 3.5&nbsp;inches (90&nbsp;mm) in [[Edmundston, New Brunswick]]. The rainfall caused basement flooding and road washouts; slick roads caused a traffic fatality in Edmundston.<ref name="candam">{{cite news|author=Canadian Hurricane Centre|year=2004|title=2004 Tropical Cyclone Season Summary|accessdate=May 18|accessyear=2006|url=http://www.atl.ec.gc.ca/weather/hurricane/storm04.html}}</ref>

==Aftermath==
22&nbsp;hours after Bonnie struck Florida, Hurricane Charley passed over the [[Dry Tortugas]]. This was the first time in recorded history that two tropical storms struck Florida in one day. Before Bonnie and Charley, the most recent example of two tropical storms hitting the state in a short amount of time was [[Hurricane Gordon (2000)|Hurricane Gordon]] and [[Tropical Storm Helene (2000)|Tropical Storm Helene]] in September 2000, which hit five days apart. Originally, it was thought that two storms in the [[1906 Atlantic hurricane season|1906 season]] hit the state within 12&nbsp;hours;<ref name="space.com">{{cite news|author=David Royse|year=2004|title=How Rare is Tropical Storm Double Trouble?|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=May 18|accessyear=2006|url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/hurricanes_two_040812.html}}</ref> however, the suspected tropical storm was downgraded to a [[tropical depression]] in a more recent analysis.<ref name="hurdat">{{cite web|author=HURDAT|year=2004|title=HURDAT Re-Analysis (1901–1910)|accessmonthday=May 18 |accessyear=2006|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/metadata_01-10.html#1906_9}}</ref>

Because Bonnie hit Florida immediately before Charley, damage between the two storms was often difficult to differentiate. President [[George W. Bush]] responded to the storm by declaring much of Florida a Federal Disaster Area on [[August 13]], [[2004]].<ref name="fema">{{cite web|author=FEMA|year=2004|title=Florida Hurricane Charley and Tropical Storm Bonnie|accessmonthday=May 18 |accessyear=2006|url=http://www.fema.gov/news/event.fema?id=3455}}</ref> 
Because the damage was minimal, the name ''Bonnie'' was not retired; it is on the list to be reused in the [[2010 Atlantic hurricane season]].
