{{Nihongo|'''''Final Fantasy XI'''''|ファイナルファンタジーXI|Fainaru Fantajī Irebun}}, also known as ''Final Fantasy XI: Online'' or simply ''Final Fantasy Online'', is a [[MMORPG|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] developed and published by [[Square Co.]] (now [[Square Enix]]). It debuted in [[Japan]] on the [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]] [[PlayStation 2]] [[video game console]] on [[May 16]], [[2002 in video gaming|2002]] and was released for [[Microsoft Windows]]-based [[personal computer]]s on [[November 5]] of the same year. It was then localized and released for the North American market on [[October 28]], [[2003 in video gaming|2003]]. An [[Xbox 360]] version was released worldwide in [[April]] [[2006 in video gaming|2006]] as the system's first MMORPG.<ref>{{cite web |author =Tor Thorsen | title=Shippin' Out 4/17-4/21: Final Fantasy XI Online, Brain Age | publisher=GameSpot | year=April 17, 2006 | url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/adventure/longestjourney2wt/news.html?sid=6147765 | accessdate=2006-12-20}}</ref> The story is set in [[Vana'diel]], where various tasks can be performed to improve a character's powers or to complete quests.

In January 2004, Square Enix announced that a total of over 500,000 users utilizing over 1 million characters were playing the game. As of 2006 there are currently between 200,000 and 300,000 active players logging in per day (see [[Final Fantasy XI#Reception|Reception]]) and the game is the dominant MMORPG in the Japanese market.<ref name="edge">{{Cite book | year=2006 | editor=Future Publishing | title=Edge June 2006; issue 163 | pages=28-29 | language=English | publisher=Future Publishing}}</ref> Three expansions for the game have been released since 2002, with a fourth planned for winter of 2007,<ref>{{cite web |author =| title= Wings of the Goddess | publisher=Final Fantasy XI Official Site | year=May 12, 2007 | url=http://www.playonline.com/ff11us/altana/index.html| accessdate=2007-5-16}}</ref> capitalizing on the game's success. Square Enix, as well as other sources, has reported that the number of users continues to grow at a steady pace.

==Gameplay== 
''Final Fantasy XI'' is unlike [[List of Final Fantasy titles|previous titles in the series]] in many ways. It can be played from a first-person as well as a third-person perspective, with players directly navigating their [[player character|character]] around the world to interact with objects and people. The player is also only able to control one character and select their character's traits, including race, gender, face, hair color, body size, job, and nationality. Unlike previous Final Fantasy games, all battles occur in real time, and enemies are no longer randomly encountered.<ref name="official">{{cite web | title=Welcome to Vana'diel| publisher=Final Fantasy XI Official Website| year=January 1, 2006| url=http://www.playonline.com/ff11us/intro/about/welcom.html?pageID=about | accessdate=2006-07-16}}</ref>

There are 32 worlds (a cluster of servers) available for play, and one world used by Square-Enix for testing and special events. Server names follow in the ''Final Fantasy'' tradition of borrowing from different mythologies, using names of summons from previous ''Final Fantasy'' titles such as [[Ifrit]] and [[devil|Diabolos]]. PC, PS2, and Xbox 360 players from across all geographic locations play together on the same servers. A recent update allows players to choose which world they may be able to play on. 
Although the game was initially exclusive to Japan, it has since been released in a number of different regions and a number of different languages, including English, German, and French. To facilitate multilingual communication, an auto translate feature has been added that contains thousands of preset terms and phrases.

===Interface===
Players have the option of using any combination of a keyboard, mouse, and [[Game controller|controller]] to play ''Final Fantasy XI''. PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 players have the option to play using only a controller with no other peripherals. In these situations, an on-screen keyboard is used to chat with other players, but reliance on communication of the game's party system leads many to use a [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] keyboard and/or mouse which can be used to control the game just as the PC version does.

The [[HUD (computer gaming)|heads-up display]] in "Final Fantasy XI" consists of a log window, menus, and several game information elements. The log window at the bottom of the screen displays system messages, battle messages, and text input by other players. Players may choose to filter what appears in the log window. Also at the bottom of the screen, a [[compass]], the current in-game time, and the player's current [[hit point]]s and [[magic point]]s are displayed. Icons representing status effects appear at the top of the screen, as well as a "communication meter" with information about the player's current network connection status. "Menus" allow the player to access different commands, status windows, and configuration options. As well as the main menu, which contains the majority of the options for the game, the "action command menu" appears just above the log window and gives the player several options to interact with the game world. Several menu options are available through the use of keyboard shortcuts as well.<ref name="manual">{{Cite book | year=2001 | editor=Square Enix| title=Final Fantasy XI instruction manual| pages=81-83 | language=English | publisher=Square Enix}}</ref>

===Missions and quests===
[[Image:FourNationsFFXI.jpg|thumb|left|The four nation symbols of mainland Vana'diel.]]
Gameplay in ''Final Fantasy XI'' consists of two major components: [[Quest (gaming)|quests]], which do not advance the main storyline but fill out the game's fantasy world, and missions, through which the main storyline of the game is told. <ref>{{cite web |author =| title= Quests, Missions, Conquest | publisher=Final Fantasy XI Official Site | year=January 1, 2007 | url=http://www.playonline.com/ff11us/guide/system/quests.html?pageID=system| accessdate=2007-02-21}}</ref> 

Quests may be undertaken for various rewards, including money, items which cannot be acquired any other way, or simply prestige. ''Final Fantasy XI''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s quest system includes a mechanic whereby reputation is accrued through the completion of quests. Each city and major area has its own fame rating and more quests open to players as they grow in fame in each area. While quests do not directly advance the main stories of the game, they may fill in some additional details that would otherwise be missed. Another tangible benefit of fame is lower prices on all goods sold by town merchants. 

Missions are undertaken to advance in rank, to access new areas and gain new privileges and to advance the various plotlines in the game. Each nation has its own set of missions (excluding Jeuno), which a player must complete to advance in rank; a player may only complete missions for his home country, resulting in some players completing all of a country's range of missions, only to switch allegiances to see another country's storyline. The newest storylines are often not available in their entirety at first, and are unlocked gradually over time. For example, both the Zilart and Dynamis storylines are unlocked when the player progresses to a certain rank (6) in any of the three starting cities. 

The ''Chains of Promathia'' and ''Treasures of Aht Urhgan'' expansions have their own missions as well; while these do not advance a player in "rank" in the manner of the city missions, players may gain access to new areas and one-of-a-kind items through progressing in these missions. ''Treasures of Aht Urhgan'' also has a Mercenary Rank system which can be increased through various assault missions. The rank system uses actual military ranks as opposed to numbers but governs the Aht Urhgan version of Signet called Sanction in excactly the same way. Players also earn Imperial Standing as opposed to Conquest Points which can be turned into special equipment, Aht Urhgan currency or permits to battlefields.

===Battle system===
[[Image:Ffxi birdnm fight.jpg|thumb|300px|A player engaged in combat]]
Battles in ''Final Fantasy XI'' take place in the same world in which players move around, unlike previous ''Final Fantasy'' games in which a battle would take place in a new screen. Players may be attacked by aggressive creatures or they may initiate attacks on creatures themselves. 

Monsters within the game operate under a complicated system of "claim" and "enmity" (also known as "hate" or "aggro"). A monster is "claimed" the moment a player performs any action upon it, whether attacking it, using most job abilities on it or casting a spell. Once it is claimed, it can only be attacked by players in the party or alliance of the player that claimed it (with the exception of battlefields and events). A monster will focus its attention on whoever has built up the most enmity. Players have a number of means at their disposal, from spells to abilities to items, to both build up enmity and shed it when it is unwanted. Thus [[tank (computer gaming)|tank]] characters, with high defense capabilities, can hold a monster's attention and keep it off those who should avoid damage, such as mages. It is possible to have a monster's attention through enmity without actually claiming the monster, so a monster could conceivably attack someone who is outside of the party or alliance that is currently attacking it.

An important part of battling in ''Final Fantasy XI'' is the technique of [[Limit Break#Final Fantasy XI|skillchains]] (a.k.a. renkei) and magic bursts. <ref name="battle">{{cite web |author =| title= Battle System | publisher=Final Fantasy XI Official Site | year=January 1, 2007 | url=http://www.playonline.com/ff11us/guide/system/battle.html?pageID=system| accessdate=2007-02-21}}</ref> Through melee attacks and taking damage, players gain "tactical points" (abbreviated ''TP'') that fill up a special gauge. When the gauge is filled, the player may use a "weapon skill." Which weapon skills are available to a player depends both upon what weapon he/she are using and his/her proficiency in that weapon; as the player advances in levels and weapon proficiency, more weapon skills become available for his/her use.

Weapon skills used by different party members may be used together in specific orders to form "skillchains." Skillchains do additional damage in battle and allow for mages to "magic burst." Each skillchain has a different elemental affinity; if a mage casts a spell of the same element as the skillchain, it will do more damage than the spell would normally.

In addition to the traditional Final Fantasy classifications of spells, magic is also divided by "magic skills." <ref name="battle" /> As a character uses spells from a certain magic skill, his/her skill in that category increases, increasing damage, magic accuracy and reducing spell interruption rate. While most magic spells cost Magic Points (abbreviated MP) to use, a Bard's songs (consumes nothing, long cast and recast timers) and a Ninja's ninjutsu (consumes ninja tools) do not.

===Player vs. player (PvP)===
Although there was originally no system allowing players to compete in battle with each other, it was eventually added to the game. In ''Final Fantasy XI'''s Player vs. Player (PvP) system, known as ''Conflict'', players may only compete directly against one another under very specific circumstances. Conflict happens only in "matches" that players enter by their own consent; players cannot attack one another outside of these circumstances. Players who are defeated in a Conflict match do not lose experience points, and they cannot lose items or equipment from being defeated. There are two types of Conflict matches. In ''Ballista'', the objective is to score points by throwing a rock, or "Petra," into a "castle-like construction" called a "Rook."<ref>{{cite web |author =| title=Chapter 2: Event Name Ballista| publisher=Final Fantasy XI Official Site | year=January 1, 2006 | url=http://www.playonline.com/ff11us/guide/conflict/ballista02.html?pageID=conflict| accessdate=2006-08-17}}</ref> ''Brenner'' resembles [[capture the flag]].

===Job system/leveling===
{{main|Final Fantasy XI character classes}}
One of ''Final Fantasy XI'''s most dynamic features is the flexibility of its job system, adapted from previous ''Final Fantasy'' titles. Players are able to change their jobs any time they wish (as long as they are inside their 'Mog House'), and eventually gain a "support job," allowing the player to learn additional skills and try different combinations.<ref name="jobs">{{cite web | title= Job and Races| publisher= Final Fantasy XI Official Website | year=January 1, 2006 | url=http://www.playonline.com/ff11us/guide/system/index.html?pageID=system | accessdate=2006-08-17}}</ref> Each job has unique abilities, which must be activated by the player in order to come into effect, last a limited time, and have a "cooldown" period before they can be used again; traits, which are passive abilities that are always in effect; and a special "2-hour" ability that performs some extraordinary function and has an extraordinary 2-hour-long cooldown period to go with it.

As of February 2007, a player may choose from 18 different jobs. <ref name="jobs" /> In homage to the six job classes available in the original ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]'', the initial jobs available to a player are [[White Mage]], [[Red Mage]], [[Black Mage]], [[Final Fantasy character classes#Warrior/Fighter/Knight|Warrior]], [[Final Fantasy character classes#Thief|Thief]], and [[Final Fantasy character classes#Monk|Monk]]. Upon achieving level 30 in any of these jobs, a player may opt to complete quests to unlock the jobs of [[Final Fantasy character classes#Paladin|Paladin]], [[Final Fantasy character classes#Dark Knight|Dark Knight]], [[Final Fantasy character classes#Beast Master/Tamer/Trainer|Beastmaster]], [[Final Fantasy character classes#Hunter|Ranger]], [[Final Fantasy character classes#Bard|Bard]], [[Final Fantasy character classes#Summoner|Summoner]], [[Final Fantasy character classes#Samurai|Samurai]], [[Final Fantasy character classes#Ninja|Ninja]], [[Final Fantasy character classes#Dragoon|Dragoon]], [[Blue Mage]], [[Final Fantasy XI character classes#Corsair|Corsair]], and [[Final Fantasy XI character classes#Puppetmaster|Puppetmaster]]. Samurai, Ninja, and Dragoon were released in the ''Rise of the Zilart'' expansion, and Blue Mage, Corsair, and Puppetmaster were released in ''Treasures of Aht Urhgan''.<ref>{{cite web | title= Final Fantasy XI: Treasures of Aht Urhgan| publisher= Square-Enix | year=January 26, 2006 | url=http://www.playonline.com/ff11us/ahturhgan/index.html | accessdate=2006-08-26}}</ref> Once the player has reached level 18 on any job, he may complete a quest that enables him to use any job he has as a "support job" for his main job. Support Jobs operate at a maximum of half the level of the player's main job and gives the character abilities, spells and stat bonuses from that job at that level. Some elements of Support Job abilities may also be reduced, such as Sneak Attack and Trick Attack when Thief is used as a support job and the "2 hour" abilities of support jobs are not availabe.

Jobs are leveled by earning experience points, obtained by defeating monsters that are within several levels of the player. After level 50, the level cap is raised by performing various quests that raise the maximum attainable level by five levels. As of this writing, the highest possible level a job can reach is 75.

===Crafting and Hobbies===
In addition to completing quests and missions, players can participate in several side activities or minigames.<ref name="official" /> 

Harvesting, excavating, logging and mining (collectively referred to as HELM), allow the player to retrieve items from the world. Harvesting produces items from plants, excavating produces bone items, logging produces varring kinds of wood and mining produces metal ores and stones that can be refined into gems. HELM activities are performed by equipping and using related tools on designated "points" scattered throughout certain zones. A player may only retrieve a few items from any one point before it is exhausted, and they must locate other points until the spent ones regenerate or "respawn". This section of the game concerning the quality or quantity of items you may receive is largely random and is not affected by or does not gain in level with participation although players can gain an edge by possessing certain items. 

Players may also try their hand at fishing, gardening, clamming, or chocobo digging. Fishing in ''Final Fantasy XI'' is a sort of [[minigame]] where a player must measure their strength against the strength of fish that bite at their line. Fishing is also known as a reliable source of gil for players of all levels and experience. Unlike some of the other [[minigames]], a player's skill at fishing improves as they do it. Gardening in ''Final Fantasy XI'' is when a player raises plants in their residence (also referred to as a mog house). Like synthesis, gardening can result in different items being produced by following recipes but results are still partially based on luck and gardening skill levels do not increase with experience. Clamming is a [[minigame]] where players collect as many fish or sea creatures as possible without going over a limit predetermined by the size bucket they're carrying. [[Chocobo]] digging is when a player commands a bird called a [[chocobo]] to dig up items from random spots on the ground. It is believed there may be a hidden level assosiated with [[chocobo]] digging that affects a players ability to dig up more valuable items. 

''Final Fantasy XI'' has a fairly complex item synthesis system, in which players use elemental crystals obtained by fighting the various monsters to turn specific combinations of items into other items. <ref>{{cite web |author =| title= Crystals and Synthesis | publisher=Final Fantasy XI Official Site | year=January 1, 2007 | url=http://www.playonline.com/ff11us/guide/system/item.html?pageID=system | accessdate=2007-2-21}}</ref> Different recipes, using different classes of ingredients and different craft skills, will produce different types of items. Items produced by the [[Alchemy]] craft skill under the guidance of the Alchemist's Guild tend to be medicines and ammunition heads, whereas items produced by Smithing and Leathercrafting tend to be armor or weapons, and Goldsmithing crafts rings and other accessories. In addition, the craft skill of cooking produces consumable food items that temporarily affect a character's statistics. Crafts incorporate many recipes for intermediate products which themselves may be used to produce useful items. For example, various ores may be refined into metal ingots, wooden logs cut into lumber or animal hides tanned into leather. Players are able to raise their crafting skills through repeated use; allowing for items of greater quality and a decreased chance of synthesis failure.

===Game Economy===
''Final Fantasy XI'' has an almost entirely player-based economy with a heavy reliance on "Auction Houses" in each of the major cities of Vana'diel. The only monsters in the game that drop any in-game currency known as [[Final Fantasy items#Currency|gil]] when defeated are the Beastmen. However, Beastmen drop very small amounts of gil, meaning that unlike other games in the ''Final Fantasy'' series, it is impossible to make much money merely by slaughtering monsters (players within the Thief class of jobs have a gilfinder ability to slightly increase the amount of gil received). Various items used in crafting, as well as sometimes extremely rare equipment items, may drop off the monsters that are defeated. There are also notorious monsters that only spawn under certain conditions, such as number of regular monsters defeated, trading an item to a certain location to make it appear, or who only appear very rarely. These type of monsters drop items that are highly priced. Players who do not require the item may sell it to other players via the Auction House. The Auction House is also the primary method of obtaining equipment, magic scrolls and other materials. There are some items that can't be placed in the auction house, but can be sold through a player run bazaar. Other players can "check" a player who placed items for sale and purchase them directly from the player. <ref name="other">{{cite web |author =| title= Other System Features | publisher=Final Fantasy XI Official Site | year=January 1, 2007 | url=http://www.playonline.com/ff11us/guide/system/other.html?pageID=system | accessdate=2007-02-21}}</ref>

Although the game economy is mostly in the hands of the players, there are certain economic controls in place. Money may go to a [[non-player character]] (NPC), as when players purchase items from NPC merchants or rent certain forms of transportation. A fee is charged to place items up for auction at the Auction House and in certain cities, players making purchases from player-run "bazaars" are taxed a percentage of the item's set price. Since transportation, auction house and tax fees do not go to players, these [[Gold sink|gilsinks]] effectively remove money from the economy.

==Setting==
[[Image:Vana'diel.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Map of Vana'diel]]
{{main|Vana'diel}}
{{seealso|List of Final Fantasy XI characters}}
The world of ''Final Fantasy XI'' is known as "[[Vana'diel]]". It consists of two main landmasses and two smaller islands flanking them, surrounded by small islands. It features diverse climates, ranging from the northern glaciers to the southern deserts. <ref name="world" />

The four main cities in Vana'diel are Bastok, San d'Oria, Windurst, and Jeuno. The expansion ''Treasures of Aht Urhgan'' added the large Aht Urhgan Whitegate/Al Zahbi city area. The rest of Vana'diel is made up of a number of outdoor, dungeon, and minor town areas split into various regions. While most areas are accessible by walking, various modes of transportation, ranging from the classic ''Final Fantasy'' [[chocobo]] and [[List of Final Fantasy airships#FInal Fantasy XI|airships]] to special spells, facilitate movement across the game world. <ref name="other" />

The five playable races in ''Final Fantasy XI'' are [[Races of Final Fantasy#Elvaan|Elvaan]], strong melee fighters, reasonable healers but weak in black magic; [[Races of Final Fantasy#Hume|Hume]], a race resembling humans, with no notable strengths or weaknesses; [[Races of Final Fantasy#Galka|Galka]], a gender-neutral but physically masculine race, strong and tough, but weak with magic; [[Races of Final Fantasy#Mithra|Mithra]], agile and dexterous, but physically weak, cat-like humanoids of which only the females of the race are playable characters and [[Races of Final Fantasy#Tarutaru|Tarutaru]], tiny humanoids with incredible power over black magic, but physically weak.<ref name="official" />

In addition to the player races, there are two primary non-playable races known as the [[Races of Final Fantasy#Zilart|Zilart]], an ancient race which is the focus of the first two game expansions, and the [[Races of Final Fantasy#Kuluu|Kuluu]], a race of beings similar to the Zilart and thought to be inferior to it. There is also a huge supporting cast of NPCs who give quests and missions and appear in the game's storylines.

The game features several typical [[Monsters of Final Fantasy|''Final Fantasy'' monsters]] as well as Beastmen, which includes races such as the Goblin, Orc, Yagudo, and Quadav. Some of these creatures follow the Shadow Lord, one source of the game's conflict.<ref>{{cite web | title=Adversaries: The Beastmen Forces| publisher=Final Fantasy XI Official Website | year=January 1, 2006 | url=http://www.playonline.com/ff11us/intro/monster/tribe.html?pageID=monster | accessdate=2006-08-17}}</ref>

There are eight major plotlines in ''Final Fantasy XI'', including the storylines of the 3 nations (San d'Oria, Bastok, and Windurst), the 3 expansion packs (Rise of the Zilart, Chains of Promathia and Treasures of Aht Urghan) and 2 sets of Dynamis realms. The Dynamis storylines are unique in that the storyline progresses through clearing special Dynamis zones, not through completing missions as with the other storylines in the game. There are also numerous sub-plots, stories that players can experience while playing the hundreds of quests available in the game.

==Development==
After the conclusion of creating the English version of ''[[Chrono Cross]]'', work began on the basic system of play for ''Final Fantasy XI''. The Japanese game players were told to expect English speaking players, since the game makers intended to create a unified game world instead of different ones balkanized by language.<ref name ="E3">{{cite web |author =Dunham, Jeremy | title=E3 2003: Final Fantasy XI Developer Interview| publisher=IGN.com | year=May 14, 2003 | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/402/402807p1.html | accessdate=2006-08-15}}</ref> This development allowed for a 66% reduction of potential costs in setup.<ref name="game">{{cite web |author =Christopher Woodard| title= GDC: Creating a Global MMO: Balancing Cultures and Platforms in Final Fantasy XI| publisher=Gamasutra.com| year=March 24, 2006 | url=http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20060324/woodard_01.shtml| accessdate=2006-08-16}}</ref>

As of this writing, no easily accessible free or inexpensive trial is available to prospective players of ''Final Fantasy XI''. To obtain a trial, an interested player must find a current subscriber with an unused buddypass, a code which allows a friend to play free for 30 days. The only other method of sampling FFXI for a month is by purchasing a retail copy of the game. Purchasing the game allows you to play the first month for free.

Each purchase of FFXI includes one buddypass. So far this is the only method available for curious players to sample the game without paying, unlike [[Blizzard Entertainments]]'s trial strategy of freely distributing their software through their homepage or for payment in retail chains. At one time, a free 30 day trial for the game was included with purchase of an Alienware PC or a Logitech product. This promotion is no longer offered.

===Expansion===
{{main|Final Fantasy XI expansions}}
When news was first circulated about an expansion to ''Final Fantasy XI'', it was thought that the game's title would be ''Final Fantasy XI: Vision of Girade'' (Which wasn't too far from the truth; it was released in Japan as ''Final Fantasy XI: Visions of Jiraat'') and was unclear whether it would be a free upgrade or not.<ref>{{cite web |author = IGN Staff| title=Final Fantasy XI Expansion Disc?| publisher=IGN.com | year=November 20, 2002 | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/377/377902p1.html | accessdate=2006-08-15}}</ref> On [[October 28]], [[2003]], ''Final Fantasy XI'' was released in [[North America]] on the personal computer along with the first expansion ''[[Final Fantasy XI: Rise of the Zilart|Rise of the Zilart]]'', with a [[PlayStation 2]] release on [[March 23]], [[2004]].<ref>{{cite web |author =Coleman, Stephen| title=Final Fantasy XI Ships| publisher=IGN.com | year=October 28, 2003 | url=http://games.ign.com/articles/456/456961p1.html|accessdate=2006-08-15}}</ref> It was also made available on the [[Xbox 360]], the first collaboration of Square Enix and [[Microsoft]].<ref>{{cite web |author = Stephen Coleman| title=Final Fantasy XI Coming to Xbox 360| publisher=IGN.com | year=May 17, 2005 | url=http://games.ign.com/articles/615/615266p1.html | accessdate=2006-08-15}}</ref> The Xbox Live version was also beta tested to see how their online playing system supported ''Final Fantasy XI''.<ref>{{cite web |author = IGN Staff| title=Final Fantasy XI Team Works on New Project| publisher=IGN.com | year=June 8, 2005 | url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/623/623561p1.html | accessdate=2006-08-15}}</ref> The Xbox version was the first game on the Xbox 360 to require the use of their hard drive addition.<ref>{{cite web |author = Simon Carless| title=Microsoft Reveals Square Enix Support, 'Selected' Backward Compatibility For Xbox 360| publisher=Gamasutra.com | year=May 16, 2005 | url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=8084 | accessdate=2006-08-16}}</ref> 

The second expansion to the game, ''[[Final Fantasy XI: Chains of Promathia|Chains of Promathia]]'', was released in Japan on [[September 16]], [[2004 in video gaming|2004]], and a bundled version of the game complete with the two expansion packs was released in Europe on the same date.

In addition, the US version of the full game plus the two expansions was released as a single DVD-ROM called "The Vana'diel Collection" on [[August 16]], [[2005 in video gaming|2005]].

The game was also released on Xbox 360 on the same day bundled with all three of the expansions released to date, and on the PC as "The Vana'diel Collection 2007" in November.

A direct sequel of ''Final Fantasy XI'' was thought to be in development for the Xbox 360, [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Windows Vista]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Final Fantasy XI in Development | publisher=IGN.com | year=July 17, 2006 | url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/719/719207p1.html|accessdate=2006-08-15}}</ref> Square Enix quickly denied this report, though they confirmed that [[Untitled Square Enix project|another MMO is in development]], albeit not related to the ''Final Fantasy'' series.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.square-enix.com/jp/company/e/news/2006/download/release_060718en.pdf | title=Comment on Recent Media Report |accessdate=2006-08-15 | year=July 18, 2006 | format=pdf | publisher=Square Enix }}</ref>

A new expansion of ''Final Fantasy XI'', entitled ''[[Final Fantasy XI: Wings of the Goddess|Wings of the Goddess]]'', was announced on [[May 12]], [[2007 in video gaming|2007]] at the Square Enix Party event in Japan.<ref>{{cite web |author = Square Enix staff| title=Official Site for "Wings of the Goddess"!| publisher=Playonline.com | year=May 12, 2007 | url=http://www.playonline.com/ff11us/index.shtml | accessdate=2007-05-12}}</ref> No release date has been announced, but Square Enix has said the new expansion will be out "Winter 2007."

===Updates===
On [[June 14]], [[2002 in video gaming|2002]], the game server was down for four hours for maintenance to the database servers, bug fixes on the text interface and a new patch for the game client.<ref>{{cite web |author = IGN Staff| title=Final Fantasy XI Server Downtime | publisher=IGN.com | year=June 12, 2002 | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/362/362009p1.html | accessdate=2006-08-15}}</ref> This is thought to be the first patch ever released for a console game.<ref>{{cite web |author = IGN Staff| title=Final Fantasy XI First Patch| publisher=IGN.com | year=June 11, 2002 | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/361/361927p1.html|accessdate=2006-08-15}}</ref> On [[July 8]], [[2002 in video gaming|2002]], Square also shut down the item auction system due to some players exploiting the system.<ref>{{cite web |author =IGN Staff| title=Final Fantasy XI Cheats Exposed| publisher=IGN.com | year=July 8, 2002 | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/364/364168p1.html | accessdate=2006-08-15}}</ref>
In early 2006, Square Enix discovered that a group of players had found a way to generate the game currency and exchange it for real currency, which in turn drove up prices for all items across the game. In response, 700 accounts were permanently banned and 300 billion Gil was removed from circulation. This effort is an attempt to stop the interaction between real and [[virtual economy]] in the online game.<ref>{{cite web |author =IGN Staff| title=Final Fantasy XI Smacks Down Cheaters| publisher=IGN.com | year=February 10, 2006 | url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/687/687847p1.html|accessdate=2006-08-15}}</ref> Square Enix has stated that the trade of items for real currency is officially a violation of the [[Terms of Service]] for ''Final Fantasy XI''.<ref>{{cite web | title=Terms and Conditions | publisher=PlayOnline | year=December 8, 2004 | url=http://www.playonline.com/ff11us/polnews/news3374.shtml | accessdate=2006-08-15}}</ref> In July 2006, Square Enix banned or suspended over 8,000 other accounts for similar manipulation and commerce.<ref>{{cite web | title=Square Enix bans more FFXI accounts| publisher=Gamespot.com | year=July 24, 2006 | url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6154572.html |author = Patrick Caldwell|accessdate=2006-08-16}}</ref> Since the update, Square Enix has been regularly banning players' accounts found in violation of the terms, some of them using third-party tools, effectively removing billions of gil from the in-game economy. The summer 2006 update has allowed for the long requested ability for players to raise and breed chocobos.<ref>{{cite web | author=Douglass C.

As of [[March 2007]], the PC version of Final Fantasy XI is compatible with [[Windows Vista]]. After working with Microsoft to resolve Final Fantasy XI's incompatibility issues with Windows Vista, Square Enix released a downloadable version of the PlayOnline client which is compatible with the [[operating system]], fixing the main incompatibility issue. While smaller bugs are still known to exist, such as the client not launching correctly through [[Windows Media Center]], the new client allows Final Fantasy XI to run correctly on Windows Vista.<ref>{{cite web | title=Support for Microsoft Windows Vista | publisher=PlayOnline | year=March 22, 2007 | url=http://www.playonline.com/homeus/headline/news01.html | accessdate=2007-03-22}}</ref>

As of [[December 2006]], the PlayStation 2 versions of PlayOnline and Final Fantasy XI install and run on PlayStation 3. A download from the PlayStation Store and ten gigabytes of available disk space (for the PS2 drive image) are required to enable support for the software on PlayStation 3.

As of March 28, 2007, players can now experience the first installment of the Chocobo Racing system. Players are allowed to enter their home-grown chocobos into races against NPCs. You can win Chocobucks used to buy prizes, such as items to assist in breeding.

==Audio==
{{main|Music of Final Fantasy XI}}
Unlike ''Final Fantasy X'', ''Final Fantasy XI'' does not have any voice actors for cutscenes, only for battle cries and related sounds. The only voice acting is the opening CGI to the game, but during actual game play none of the non-player characters speak. Instead text descriptions are used to indicate what they are communicating to the players. The opening CGI also features choral music with lyrics in [[Esperanto]]. According to its composer, [[Nobuo Uematsu]], the choice of language was meant to symbolize the developers' hope that their online game could contribute to cross-cultural communication and cooperation. 

The music of ''Final Fantasy XI'' was [[video game music|scored]] by Nobuo Uematsu, [[Naoshi Mizuta]], and [[Kumi Tanioka]]. The expansion packs were scored by Mizuta alone after Tanioka left to pursue other projects and Uematsu left Square Enix. A holiday score titled ''Jeuno -Starlight Celebration-'' could be heard in the city of Jeuno during mid to late December. It was first introduced on December 2004 and has been played each December since then. The music can also be heard while in the area known as Dynamis - Tavnazia. A vocal, ''Distant Worlds'', performed by Izumi Masuda, composed by Uematsu and arranged by Mizuta, was later released in a July [[2005 in music|2005]] patch and was released on the Japan [[iTunes]] Music Store of 13 September [[2005 in music|2005]].

Nobuo Uematsu noted the increased difficulty of scoring a game for which there was no linear plotline, a major change from the previous ten ''Final Fantasy'' games. It was also the first game in the series for which he composed while he was no longer a Square employee.<ref>{{cite web |author =Rob Fahey| title=Focus On: Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu| publisher=gamesindustry.biz | year=February 25, 2005 | url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=7033 | accessdate=2006-08-15}}</ref> The 2004-2005 concert series, [[Dear Friends: Music From Final Fantasy]], featured "Ronfaure" from ''Final Fantasy XI''.

A compilation CD box was released on [[March 28]], [[2007]], titled ''Final Fantasy XI Original Soundtrack PREMIUM BOX'', and includes the four OSTs for ''Final Fantasy XI'' and its three expansion sets, unreleased tracks from the game, along with the previously unreleased ''Final Fantasy XI Piano Collections''.<ref>{{cite web | title=Final Fantasy XI Original Soundtrack PREMIUM BOX| publisher=Square Enix | year=2007 | url=http://www.square-enix.co.jp/music/sem/page/ff11box/info.html | accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref>
