'''[[Slavery]]''' was an essential component throughout the development of '''[[Ancient Greece]]'''.   
Most of the ancients considered it not only essential, but quite natural: neither the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] nor [[Early Christianity|Early Christians]] called the practice into question.  Notwithstanding this, as early as the [[4th century BC]], some isolated debate begins to appear (notably [[Plato]] - see below).

Conforming to modern history practice, this article will discuss only '''[[chattel slavery]]'''—not dependent groups of Ancient Greece such as the [[Penestai]] of [[Thessaly]], the [[Sparta]]n [[Helots]] or the [[Clarotes]] of [[Crete]]; complex statuses perhaps more similar to [[Middle Ages|Mediaeval]] [[serfdom]]. The slave is an individual deprived of liberty and forced to submit to a proprietor who may buy, sell, or lease them as any [[chattel]] good. 	 
		 
The study of slavery in Ancient Greece poses a number of significant methodological problems. Documentation is disparate and very fragmented, concentrating on the city of [[Athens]]. There is no treatise devoted specifically to the subject. Judicial activities of the [[4th century BC]] were interested in slavery only insofar as a source of revenue.	 
		 
In the arts, [[comedy]] represented slaves of comedy; [[Greek tragedy]] the slaves of tragedy. In iconography or on [[stele]]s, it is difficult to differentiate a slave from an artisan with certainty. Even the terminology is often vague (see below).	 
		 
== Terminology ==	 
		 
The Ancient Greeks had many words to describe slaves, though many need to be placed in proper context to avoid ambiguity. In the [[Homeric Greek|language of Homer]], the slave was called {{polytonic|δμώς}} / ''dmôs''. In a military context, the term indicates "prisoner" in the context of booty or plunder; in other words, property. During the classical period, they used {{polytonic|ἀνδράποδον}} / ''andrápodon'' (literally "one with the feet of a man", as opposed to {{polytonic|τετράποδον}} / ''tetrapodon'', the quadruped, or livestock). The most common word is undoubtedly {{polytonic|δοῦλος}} / ''doûlos'' (an earlier form of which appears in [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] inscriptions as ''do-e-ro''<ref>Mycenean transliterations can be confusing and do not directly reflect pronunciation; for clarification see [[Linear B]]</ref>), used in opposition to free man ({{polytonic|ἐλεύθερος}} / ''eleútheros''); it can be used metaphorically for other forms of dominion, as of one city over another, or parents over their children. <ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2328156 definition] from [[LSJ]]</ref>. There are also instances in which the Greeks saw a spectrum from slavery to citizenship, the highest legitimate right.<ref>For these see especially Marie-Madeleine Mactoux: ''Douleia: Esclavage et Practiques discursives dans l'Athènes classique.'' (Paris, 1980)</ref> Finally, the term {{polytonic|οἰκέτης}} / ''oikétês'' was used; meaning literally, "he who lives in the home", or, by extension "domestic".	 
		 
Other terms used were less precise and required context:	 
* {{polytonic|θεράπων}} / ''therápôn'' : at the time of [[Homer]], the word meant "equerry" ([[Patroclus]] was referred to as the ''therapôn'' of [[Achilles]] and [[Meriones (mythology)|Meriones]] that of [[Idomeneus]]); during the classical age, it meant "servant";	 
* {{polytonic|ἀκόλουθος}} / ''akólouthos'', literally, "the follower" or "the one who accompanies";	 
* {{polytonic|παῖς}} / ''pais'', literally "child", used in the same way "boy" can be used in a derogatory way;	 
* {{polytonic|σῶμα}} / ''sôma'', literally "body", used in the context of emancipation.

== Origins of Slavery ==

The time period when slavery appeared is unknown, if indeed there was a single time period.  Defeated enemies in warfare were a source of slaves from the earliest recorded times.  The presence of slaves is confirmed in the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean civilization]]. According to tablets from [[Pylos]], 140 ''do-e-ro'' can be identified with certainty. It is possible to distinguish two legal categories: "common" slaves, and "slaves of the god" (''te-o-jo do-e-ro'' i.e. θεοιο), the god in this case probably being [[Poseidon]]. Slaves of the god are always mentioned by name and own their own land; their legal treatment is close to that of freemen. The nature and origin of their bond to the divinity are unclear<ref>Walter Burkert, ''Greek Religion'', Blackwell Publishing, 1985, p.45.</ref>. As for the other and based on the ethnicity of their names, some of them came from [[Kythira|Kythera]], [[Chios]], [[Lemnos]] or even [[Halicarnassus]], and were probably enslaved as a result of [[piracy]]. The tablets indicate that unions between slaves and non-slaves were not uncommon, that slaves could be independent artisans, and that they could even retain plots of land. In fact, it appears that the major division in Mycenaean civilization was not whether one was free or enslaved, but whether one was a dependent of the palace or not<ref>A. Mele, “Esclavage et liberté dans la société mycénienne”, proceedings of the 1973 GIREA seminar, pp.115-155.</ref>.
		 
In the time of [[Homer]] when social structures reflected those of the [[Greek dark ages]], there is no continuity with the Mycenaean era. There was even a different terminology; however, Homer is written in a different dialect — or rather combination of dialects — than were the Mycenaean tablets, which may account for this. The slave is no longer ''do-e-ro'' (doulos), but ''dmôs''. In the [[Iliad]], as well as the [[Odyssey]] slaves are above all women taken as booty of war, while men were either ransomed or killed on the field of battle. These women were servants and sometimes concubines. There were some male slaves, above all in the Odyssey: a prime example being the swineherd Eumaeus. The slave was distinctive in being a member of the core part of the ''oikos'' (family unit, household). The term ''dmôs'' is not considered pejorative and Eumaeus, the "divine" swineherd benefits from the same Homeric praise as the Greek heroes. In spite of this, slavery remains a disgrace. Eumaeus himself declares that, "Nay, thralls are no more inclined to honest service when their masters have lost the dominion, for Zeus, of the far-borne voice, takes away the half of a man's virtue, when the day of slavery comes upon him."	 
<ref>XVII, 322–323. Online version of Butcher-Lang 1879 translation, http://www.robotwisdom.com/jaj/homer/odyssey.html</ref>	 
 
During this period it is difficult to determine when slave trading commenced. In "''Works and Days''" of the [[8th century BC]], it is apparent that [[Hesiod]] owns numerous ''dmôes'', although their status is unclear. The presence of ''douloi'' is confirmed by lyric poets such as [[Archilochus]] or [[Theognis of Megara]]<ref>Garlan, p.43 (French edition).</ref>. According to tradition the homicide law of [[Draco (lawgiver)|Draco]] of 620 BC mentioned slaves. According to Plutarch in his ''"Life of Solon", I,6'', [[Solon]] around 594-593 BC forbade slaves from practising gymnastics and pederasty. By the end of this era references become more common. It is at the moment that Solon establishes the basis for Athenian democracy that slavery is made indispensable. [[Moses Finley]] likewise remarks that Chios, which — according to [[Theopompus]]<ref>Apud Athenaeus, 6:265bc = [[Fragmente der griechischen Historiker|FGrH]] 115, fgt.122.</ref> — was the first city to have a slave trade, also saw an early democratization, in the 6th century BC. And, he concludes "one of the aspects of Greek history is, in short, the advance, hand-in-hand of liberty ''and'' slavery." <ref>M. I. Finley, "Was the Greek civilization founded on slavery?", ''Economy and Society in Ancient Greece'', pp. 170–171.</ref>

== Economic role ==	 
		 
[[Image:Amphora olive-gathering BM B226.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Agriculture in Ancient Greece|Agriculture]], a common use for slaves, [[British Museum]]]]	 
		 
Properly speaking there was no such thing as a servile act. All acts were open to being carried out by a slave with the exception of politics, the only activity over which citizens had a monopoly. Moreover for the Greeks, politics was the only activity deserving of the dignity of a citizen; the rest having been abandoned where ever possible to non-citizens. It was status that was of importance, not activity. 	 
		 
The principal activity using slaves was agriculture, the foundation of the Greek economy. There is an abundant literature of manuals for landowners (such as ''the economy'' of [[Xenophon]] or that of [[Pseudo-Aristotle]]). One resorted to servile manpower when the required capabilities exceeded those of the family unit. On the larger estates the stewards were usually slaves. On the other hand, one does not find in Greece the immense slave populations found on the Roman ''[[latifundia]]''.	 
		 
In the [[Mining|mine]]s and [[Quarry|quarries]], slave labour was by far the most important. Here one finds large slave populations, often leased by rich private citizens. As such the [[strategos]] [[Nicias]] leased a thousand slaves to the silver mines of [[Laurion]], in [[Attica]]; Hipponicos 600 and Philomidès, 300. Xenophon (''On Revenues'') indicates that they received one [[obolus]] per slave per day, i.e. 60 [[drachma]]s per year. It was one of the most prized investments for Athenians. Xenophon estimates that 30,000 slaves worked at Laurion or at the mills processing ore (''ibid.'', IV, 14). He suggests that if the city were endowed with more than three state slaves per citizen, their leasing would assure the upkeep of all citizens.	 
		 
Slaves were also used as [[artisan]]s and [[tradesperson]]s. As in agriculture, they were used for labour which was beyond the capability of the family. Nevertheless, the slave population was most important in the workshops. The shield factory of [[Lysias]] employed 120 slaves and the father of [[Demosthenes]] had 32 cutlers and 20 bedmakers. 	 
		 
Finally, slaves were also employed in the home. The domestic's main role was to replace the master in his trade and to accompany him on his trips. In times of war, he was the batman to the [[hoplite]]. The female slave carried out domestic tasks, in particular bread baking and textile making. Only the poorest citizens did not possess a domestic slave.

== Demographics==	 
=== Population ===	 
		 
[[Image:NAMA Cheval & esclave éthiopien.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Ethiopia]]n slave attempts to break a horse, date unknown, [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]]]]	 
		 
It is difficult to estimate the number of slaves in ancient Greece, given the lack of a precise census and variations in definitions during that era. 	 
		 
It is certain that Athens had the largest slave population with as many as 80,000 in the [[5th century BC|5th]] and [[6th century BC]]<ref>Lauffer, ''Die Bewerkssklaven von Laureion'', ''Abhandlungen'' n° 12, 1956, pp. 904–916.</ref>, with on average three or four slaves per household. In the [[5th century BC]], [[Thucydides]] remarks upon the desertion of 20,000 slaves during the [[Decelea|war of Decelea]], mostly tradesmen. The lowest estimate, of 20,000 slaves during the time of [[Demosthenes]]<ref>A.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;Jones, ''Athenian Democracy'', Oxford, Blackwell, 1957, pp. 76–79.</ref> corresponds to one slave per family. Finally, between [[317 BC]] and [[307 BC]], the tyrant [[Demetrius Phalereus]] ordered (chronology of Ctesicles, preserved by [[Athenaeus]], VI, 272c) a general census of Attica which arrived at the following figures: 21,000 citizens, 10,000 [[Metic]]s and 400,000 slaves. The orator [[Hypereides]], in his ''Against Aristogiton'', recalls that the effort to enroll 150,000 slaves (males of military age) led to the defeat of the Greeks at the [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)]], which corresponds to the figures of Ctesicles.	 
	 
According to the literature, it appears that the majority of Athenians owned at least one slave. [[Aristophanes]] in ''[[Plutus (play)|Plutus]]'' pictures poor peasants who have several slaves; Aristotle (''Politics'', 252a26–b15) defines a house as containing freemen and slaves. Conversely, not owning even one slave was a clear sign of poverty. In the celebrated discourse of [[Lysias]], ''On the Disabled'' a cripple pleading for a pension explains "my income is very small and now I'm required to do these things myself and do not even have the means to purchase a slave who can do these things for me." Nevertheless, the huge slave populations of the Romans were unknown to the Greeks. When Athenaeus (VI, 264d) cites the case of Mnason, friend of Aristotle and owner of a thousand slaves, this appears to be exceptional. [[Plato]] (owner of five slaves at the time of his death), describes the very rich as owning 50 slaves (''Republic'', IX, 578d–e). 	 
		 
In terms of density, Thucydides (VIII, 40, 2) estimates that the isle of [[Chios]] had proportionally the largest number of slaves.

=== Sources of supply ===	 
		 
There were four primary sources of slaves: war, [[piracy]] (at sea), banditry (on land), and international trade. 	 
		 
==== War ====	 
In the war customs of the period, the victor possessed absolute rights over the vanquished, whether they were combatants or not. Enslavement, while not systematic, was common practice. [[Thucydides]] (VI, 62 and VII, 13) recalls that 7000 inhabitants of Hyccara in [[Sicily]] were taken prisoner by [[Nicias]] and sold for 120 [[Talent (weight)|talents]] in the neighbouring village of [[Catania]]. Likewise in [[348 BC]] the population of [[Olynthus]] was reduced to slavery, as was that of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] in [[335 BC]] by [[Alexander the Great]], and that of [[Mantineia]] by the [[Achaean League]].	 
		 
The existence of Greek slaves was a constant source of discomfort for free Greeks. The enslavement of cities was also a very contested practice. Some generals refused, such as the [[Sparta|Spartans]] [[Agesilaus II]] ([[Plutarch]], ''Life of Agesilaus'', VII, 6) and also [[Callicratidas]] ([[Xenophon]], ''Hellenica'', I, 6, 14). Some cities passed accords to forbid the practice: in the middle of the [[3rd century BC]], [[Milet]] convened not to reduce any free [[Knossos|Knossian]] to slavery, and vice versa. The emancipation by means of ransom of a city which had been entirely reduced to slavery was conversely very prestigious: [[Cassander]], in [[316 BC]], restored Thebes. Before him, [[Philip II of Macedon]] successively enslaved and then emancipated [[Stageira]].

==== Piracy ====	 
		 
War provided a significant and consistent supply of slaves. The same went for [[piracy]] and brigandage, though the significance of this varied according to era and region <ref>Cf. H.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Ormerod, ''Piracy in the Ancient World'', Liverpool University Press, 1924; P. Brûlé, ''La Piraterie crétoise hellénistique'', Belles Lettres, 1978; V. Gabrielsen, "La piraterie et le commerce des esclaves", in E. Erskine (ed.), ''Le monde hellénistique. Espaces, sociétés, cultures 323-31 av. J.-C.'', Presses Universitaires de Rennes, 2004, 495-511.</ref>. Pirates and brigands would demand ransom whenever the status of their catch warranted it. Whenever ransom was not paid, or was not warranted, they would be sold to a trafficker. As such, nobody was immune from falling into servitude. In certain areas, piracy was practically a national specialty; qualified by Thucydides as "the old-fashioned" way of life (I, 5, 3): such was the case of [[Acarnania]], [[Crete]] as well as [[Aetolia]]. Outside of Greece, this was also the case with [[Illyria]]ns, [[Phoenicia]]ns and [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]]. During the [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic period]], [[Cilicia]]ns and the mountain peoples from the coasts of [[Anatolia]] could also be added to the list. [[Strabo]] explains the popularity of the practice amongst the Cilicians by its profitability: [[Delos]], not far away, allowed for "moving a myriad of slaves daily" (XIV, 5, 2). The growing influence of the [[Roman Empire]], a large consumer of slaves, led to development of the market and aggravation of piracy. In the [[1st century BC]], however, the Romans eradicated piracy to protect the Mediterranean trade routes.

==== International trade ====	 
		 
Amongst others, a slave trade existed with neighbouring barbarians: [[Thracians]], [[Scythia]]ns, [[Cappadocia|Cappadocians]], [[Paphlagonia]]ns, etc. The mechanism was similar to that later seen in the [[African slave trade]]: local professionals sold their fellow creatures to Greek slave merchants. The principal centres of the slave trade appear to have been [[Ephesus]], [[Byzantium]] and even [[Tanais]], the mouth of the [[Don River, Russia|Don]]. Some barbarian slaves were victims of war or localised piracy, but others were sold by their parents ([[Herodotus]], V, 6; [[Philostratus#Philostratus II|Philostratus II]], ''[[Life of Apollonius Tyana]]'', 18, 7, 12). There is a lack of direct evidence of slave traffic, but there is corroborating evidence. Firstly, certain nationalities are consistently and significantly represented in the slave population, such as the corps of Scythian archers employed by Athens as a police force (originally 300, but eventually nearly a thousand). Secondly, the names given to slaves in the [[Ancient Greek comedy|comedies]] often had a geographical link; thus ''Thratta'', used by [[Aristophanes]] in ''[[The Wasps]]'', ''[[The Acharnians]]'' and ''[[Peace (play)|Peace]]'' simply signified ''Thracian woman'' <ref>During the Classical and [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] periods, it was the master who named the slave; this could be the master's name, an ethnic name as mentioned above, a name from their native area (Manes for Lydian, Midas for a Phrygian, etc.), a historical name {Alexander, Cleopatra, etc.}. In short, a slave could carry practically any name, but barbarian names could only be given to slaves. Cf. O.&nbsp;Masson, 	 
"Slave Names in Greek Antiquity", ''Procedures of the 1971 Colloquium on Slavery'', p. 9—21.</ref>. Finally, the nationality of a slave was a significant criterion for major purchasers; the ancient advice was not to concentrate too many slaves of the same origin in the same place, in order to limit the risk of revolt. It is also probable that, as with the Romans, certain nationalities were considered more productive as slaves than others. 	 
		 
The price of slaves varied in accordance with their ability. Xenophon valued a Laurion miner at 180 [[drachma]]s; in comparison a workman at major works was paid one [[drachma]] per day. Demosthenes' father's cutlers were valued at 500 to 600 [[drachma]]s each. Price was also a function of the quantity of slaves available: in the [[4th century BC]] they were abundant and it was thus a buyer's market.	 
		 
=== Natural growth ===	 
	 
[[Image:Funerary stele Louvre Ma4498.jpg|thumb|right|290px|Funerary stele for two young children and their pedagogue, killed in an earthquake, [[Nicomedia]], [[1st century BC]], [[Louvre]]]]	 
Curiously, it appears that the Greeks did not 'breed' their slaves. Sometimes the cause of this is natural: mines, for instance, were exclusively a male domain. On the other hand, there were many female domestic slaves. The example of blacks in the American south on the other hand demonstrates that slave populations did multiply. This incongruity remains relatively unexplained. Xenophon advised that male and female slaves should be lodged separately, that "…nor children born and bred by our domestics without our knowledge and consent–no unimportant matter, since, if the act of rearing children tends to make good servants still more loyally disposed, cohabiting but sharpens ingenuity for mischief in the bad."<ref>''The Economist'', IX; trans H. G. Dakyns from 	 
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext98/econm10.txt accessed 16 May 06</ref> More simply, the explanation is no doubt economic: it is cheaper to purchase a slave than to raise one. Additionally, child birth placed the slave-mother's life at risk, and the baby was not guaranteed to survive to adulthood. 	 
		 
Slaves born at the master's home, as minors, often constituted a privileged class. They were, for example, entrusted to take the children to school: they were the "[[Pedagogy|pedagogues]]" in the first sense of the term. (cf. [[Ancient Greece#Education|Education in Ancient Greece]]).	 
		 
== Status of Slaves ==	 
		 
The Greeks had not one but many degrees of enslavement. More precisely, there was a multitude ranging from free citizen to chattel slave, and including serfs ([[Penestai]] or [[Helots]]), disenfranchised citizens, the emancipated, bastards, and [[Metic]]s.	 
		 
[[Moses Finley]] (1997) proposed a set of criteria for different degrees of enslavement:	 
		 
* right to property;	 
* authority over the work of another;	 
* power of punishment over another;	 
* legal rights and duties (possibility to be arrested and/or punished arbitrarily, or to litigate); 	 
* familial rights and privileges (marriage, inheritance; etc.)	 
* possibility of social mobility (emancipation);	 
* religious rights and obligations;	 
* military rights and obligations (military service as servant, heavy or light soldier, or sailor).	 

The obvious criterion for slavery, the right to vote and decide for the affairs of your community or state, (especially the right to vote for decisions instead for persons that are supposed to decide on your behalf) has been accidentally forgotted to be included into Finley's list.  		
 
=== Athenian Slaves ===	 
	 
[[Image:NAMA_Loutrophoros_Polystratos.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Funerary [[Loutrophoros]]; on the right a young slave carries his master's shield and helm, &nbsp;[[380 BC|380]]—[[370 BC]], [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]]]]	

The system in [[Athens]] encouraged slaves to save up to purchase their freedom, and records survive of slaves operating businesses by themselves, making only a fixed tax-payment to their masters. Athens also had a law forbidding the striking of slaves — if a person struck an apparent slave in Athens, that person might find himself hitting a fellow-citizen, because many citizens dressed no better. It startled other Greeks that Athenians tolerated back-chat from slaves ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0157 Old Oligarch, Constitution of the Athenians]). [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (writing nearly seven centuries after the event) states that Athenian slaves fought together with Athenian freemen in the [[Battle of Marathon]], and the monuments memorialize them [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160&layout=&loc=1.29.6]. [[Plutarch]] mentions that during  the [[Battle of Salamis]] Athenians did their best to save their "women, children and slaves".  
		 
In Athens slaves had no judicial rights. A misdemeanour that would result in a fine for the free would result in a flogging for the slave; the ratio seems to have been one lash for one drachma. With several minor exceptions, the testimony of a slave was not acceptable except under torture. The slave himself was not protected: if mistreated the master could initiate litigation for damages and interest ({{polytonic|δίκη βλάβης}} / ''dikê blabês''). Conversely, a master who excessively mistreated a slave could be prosecuted by any citizen ({{polytonic|γραφὴ ὕβρεως}} / ''graphê hybreôs''; this was not enacted for the sake of the slave, but to avoid violent excess.({{polytonic|ὕβρις}} / ''[[hubris]]''). It was the same for the murder of a slave. It was the pollution of the shedding of blood that was the evil here; as such the suspect was judged by the [[Palladion]] (a court reserved for unintentional homicide cases), rather than the [[Areopagus]], and the maximum punishment was exile, as for involuntary manslaughter.

=== Slaves in Gortyn ===	 
		 
In [[Gortyn]], according to a [[Gortyn code|code]] engraved in stone dating to the [[6th century BC]] slaves (''doulos'' or ''oikeus'') found themselves in a state of great dependence. Their children belonged to the master. He was also responsible for all their offences and inversely he received amends for crimes committed against his slaves by others. In the Gortyn code where all punishment was monetary, fines for slaves were doubled when they committed a misdemeanour or felony. Conversely, an offence committed against a slave was much less expensive than offences committed against the free. As an example the rape of a free woman by a slave was punishable by a fine of 200 [[stater]]s, while the rape of a non-virgin slave by another slave brought a fine of only one obolus. 	 
		 
Nevertheless, slaves did have the right to possess a home and livestock which could be transmitted to descendants, as could clothing and household objects.

=== A specific case: slavery for debt ===	 
	 
Prior to its interdiction by [[Solon]], Athenians practised enslavement for debt: a citizen incapable of paying his debts became enslaved to the creditor. This primarily concerned those peasants known as "hectemores", working leased land belonging to rich landowners, and unable to pay their rents. In theory, those so enslaved would be liberated when their original debts were repaid. The system was developed with variants throughout the [[Near East]], and is cited in the [[Bible]] (Deuteronomy, 15:12–17), apparently having been formalised in Athens by [[Draco (lawgiver)|Draco]].	 
		 
Solon put an end to it with the {{polytonic|σεισάχθεια}} / ''seisakhtheia'', liberation of debts, which prevented all claim to the person by the debtor and forbade the sale of free Athenians, including by themselves. [[Aristotle]] quotes Solon thus (''[[Constitution of the Athenians]]'' XII, 4):	 
<blockquote>And many a man whom fraud or law had sold	 
For from his god-built land, an outcast slave,	 
I brought again to Athens; yea, and some,	 
Exiles from home through debt’s oppressive load,	 
Speaking no more the dear Athenian tongue,	 
But wandering far and wide, I brought again;	 
And those that here in vilest slavery	 
Crouched ‘neath a master’s frown, I set them free.	 
	 
<ref>Chap XII, trans. Kenyon, Sir Frederic, http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/athenian/ Accessed 15 May 06</ref>	 
</blockquote>	 
	 
Much as the vocabulary used is that of 'traditional' slavery, servitude for debt was somewhat different in that the enslaved Athenian remained an Athenian, dependent on another Athenian, in his place of birth. It is this aspect which explains the great wave of discontent with slavery of the [[6th century BC]], which was not intended to free all slaves; but only those enslaved by debt. The reforms of Solon did however leave one exception: the guardian of an unmarried woman who had lost her virginity had the right to sell her as a slave <ref>Extract from the G. Mathieu and B. Haussoulier translation reviewed by [[Claude Mossé]] in Belles Lettres, 1985.</ref>.	 
		 
=== Emancipation ===	 
	 
The practice of emancipation is confirmed to have existed in [[Chios]] from the [[6th century BC]]. It probably dates back to an earlier period, as it was an oral procedure. Informal emancipations are also confirmed in the classical period. It was sufficient to have witnesses who would escort the citizen to emancipate their slave publicly, either at the [[Theatre of Ancient Greece#Theatre Structure and Layout|theater]] or before public tribunal. This practice was outlawed in Athens in the middle of the [[6th century BC]], in order to avoid public disorder. 	 
	 
The practice became more common in the [[4th century BC]] and lead to inscriptions in stone which have been recovered from sanctuaries such as [[Delphi]] and [[Dodona]]. They primarily date to the [[2nd century BC|2nd]] and [[1st century BC]], and the [[1st century]] AD. According to this documentation emancipation appeared to be a voluntary act on the part of the master (predominantly male, but from the Hellenistic period also female). The slave was often required to pay for himself for an amount at least equivalent to his street value. To do this he could either use his savings, take a loan from a friend ({{polytonic|ἔρανος}} / ''eranos''), or from his master. The emancipation was often of a religious nature: where the slave was considered to be "sold" to a deity (often [[Apollo]]), or consecrated after his emancipation. The temple would receive a portion of the monetary transaction and guarantee the contract. The emancipation could also be entirely civil in which case the magistrate played the role of the deity. 	 
		 
The slave's freedom could be either total or partial, at the master's whim. In the former, the emancipated slave was legally protected against all attempts at re-enslavement, for instance on the part of the former master's inheritors. In the latter case, the emancipated slave could be liable to a number of obligations to the former master. The most restrictive contract was the ''paramone'', a type of enslavement of limited duration during which time the master retained practically absolute rights.  
	 
In regards to the city, the emancipated slave was far from equal to a citizen of birth. He was liable to all types of obligations, as one can see from the proposals of [[Plato]] in ''The Laws'' (XI, 915 a–c): presentation three times monthly at the home of the former master, forbidden to become richer than him, etc. In fact, the status of an emancipated slave was similar to that of a [[Metic]].

== Slavery conditions ==	 
[[Image:Black slave Louvre Br361.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Black slave with tied hands, [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], [[musée du Louvre]]]]	 
	 
It is difficult to appreciate the condition of Greek slaves. According to pseudo-Aristotle (''Economics'', 1344a35), the daily routine of slaves could be summed up in three words: "work, discipline, and feeding". Xenophon's advice is to treat slaves as domestic animals, that is to say punish disobedience and reward good behaviour (''Economics'', XIII, 6). For his part, Aristotle prefers to see slaves treated as children, and to use not only orders, but also recommendations, as the slave is capable of understanding reasons when they are explained (''Politics'', I, 3, 14).	 
	 
Greek literature abounds with scenes of slaves being flogged: it was a means of forcing work, as was control of rations, clothing, and rest. This violence could be meted out by the master as well as the supervisor; who was possibly also a slave. Thus, at the beginning of [[Aristophanes]]' ''[[The Knights]]'', two slaves complain of being "bruised and thrashed without respite" <ref>S. B. Pomeroy, ''Goddesses, Whores, Wives and Slaves'', Schoken, 1995, p. 57.</ref> by their new supervisor. However, Aristophanes himself cites what is a typical old saw in [[Ancient Greek comedy]] (''Peace'', v. 743–749):	 
<blockquote>	 
"He also dismissed those slaves who kept on running off, or deceiving someone, or getting whipped. They were always led out crying, so one of their fellow slaves could mock the bruises and ask then: 'Oh you poor miserable fellow, what's happened to your skin? Surely a huge army of lashes from a whip has fallen down on you and laid waste your back?'" <ref>trans Ian Johnston, 2006. http://www.mala.bc.ca/~Johnstoi/aristophanes/peace.htm accessed 17 May 06</ref> </blockquote>	 
	 
In fact, the condition of slaves varied very much according to their status: the mine slave of Laurion lived a particularly brutal existence, while city slaves enjoyed relative independence. In return for a fee ({{polytonic|ἀποφορά}} / ''apophora'') paid to their master, they could live and work alone. They could thus earn some money on the side; sometimes enough to purchase their freedom. Potential emancipation was in effect a powerful motivator, though the real scale of this is difficult to estimate. Pseudo-Xenophon goes so far as to deplore the liberties taken by Athenian slaves: "as for the slaves and Metics of Athens, they take the greatest licence; you cannot just strike them, and they do not step aside to give you free passage" (''Constitution of the Athenians'', I, 10).	 
	 
This alleged good treatment did not prevent 20,000 Athenian slaves from running away at the end of the [[Peloponnesian War]], on the incitement of the Spartan garrison at [[Attica]] in [[Decelea]]. And these were principally skilled artisans and tradespersons, probably amongst the better-treated slaves. Conversely, the absence of a large-scale Greek slave revolt, comparable to that of [[Spartacus]] in [[Rome]] for instance, can undoubtedly be explained by the relative dispersion of Greek slaves, which would have prevented any large-scale planning. It should be noted though that slave revolts were rare, even in Rome or the [[Confederate States of America]]<ref>On that subject, see [[Paul Cartledge]], "Rebels and Sambos in Classical Greece", ''Spartan Reflections'', University of California Press (2003), p.127-152.</ref>.

No author of antiquity calls the existence of slavery into question; at most they admit that certain slaves may have been unjustly enslaved. To [[Homer]] and the pre-classical authors, slavery was an inevitable consequence of war. [[Heraclitus]] states: "War is the father of all, the king of all...he turns some into slaves and sets others free" (fragment 53).	 
	 
During the classical period, the idea of "natural" slavery emerged; thus, as [[Aeschylus]] states in ''[[The Persians]]'', the Greeks "[o]f no man are they called the slaves or vassals<ref>The Persians, v. 242. trans. ed. Herbert Weir Smyth, http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Aesch.+Pers.+1 accessed 17 May 2006 ,</ref>". while the [[Persian people|Persians]], as [[Euripides]] states in (''[[Helen (play)|Helen]]'', (v.&nbsp;276) "are all slaves, except one" — the grand king. [[Hippocrates]] theorizes about this latent idea at the end of the [[5th century BC]]: according to him, the temperate climate of [[Anatolia]] produced a placid and submissive people. This explanation is reprised by [[Aristotle]] in ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', where he develops the concept of "natural slavery": "for he that can foresee with his mind is naturally ruler and naturally master, and he that can do these things with his body is subject and naturally a slave."<ref name="politics"> Politics. trans. H. Rackham http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0058&query=book%3D%231 accessed 17 May 2006</ref> (I,2,2) As opposed to animals, slaves can comprehend reason but "... has not got the deliberative part at all<ref name="politics" /> (I, 13, 17)". Plato, himself reduced to slavery until emancipated by one of his friends, unusually provides an explicit condemnation of slavery in ''[[Menon]]'' by involving a slave in a philosophical discussion. Through this the slave's status as a human being in full measure is acknowledged, negating the fundamental basis of slavery. 	 
	 
In parallel, the concept that all men, whether Greek or barbarian, belonged to the same race was being developed by the [[sophism|Sophists]]; and thus that certain men were slaves although they had the soul of a freeman and vice versa. Aristotle himself recognized this possibility (''Politics'', I, 5, 10) and argued that slavery could not be imposed if the master was better than the slave thereby proving the concept of "natural" slavery. The sophists concluded that true servitude was not a matter of status but a matter of spirit; thus, as [[Menander]] stated, "be free in the mind, although you are slave: and thus you will no longer be a slave" (fragment 857). This idea repeated by the [[stoicism|Stoics]] and the [[Epicurianism|Epicurians]], was not so much an opposition to slavery as trivializing it. 	 
	 
The Greeks could not comprehend an absence of slaves. Even in the [[wiktionary:Cloudcuckooland|Cloudcuckooland]]" of Artistophanes' [[The Birds (play)|The Birds]]. The "reversed cities" placed women in power or even saw the end of private property (''[[Lysistrata]]'', ''[[Assemblywomen]]'') but could not picture slaves in charge of masters. The only societies without slaves were those of the [[Golden age]], where all needs were met. In this type of society, as explained by Plato (''Politics'', 271a–272b), one reaped generously without sowing. In Telekleides' ''Amphictyons'', (cited by [[Athenaeus]], 268 b–d) barley loaves fight with wheat loaves for the honour of being eaten by men. Moreover objects move themselves; dough kneads itself, and the carafe pours itself. Society without slaves is thus relegated to a different time and space. In a "normal" society one needs slaves.

=== Modern views ===

Slavery in Greek antiquity has long been an object of [[apologetics|apologetic]] discourse among Christians, who awarded themselves the merit of its collapse. From the [[16th century]] the discourse became moralizing in nature: the existence of [[colonialism|colonial]] slavery had significant impact on the debate, with some authors lending it civilizing merits while others denouncing its misdeeds. Thus [[Henri Wallon]] in 1847 published a ''History of Slavery in Antiquity'' amongst his works for the [[Abolitionism|abolition of slavery]] in the [[French colonial empires|French colonies]].

In the [[19th century]] a politico-economic discourse emerged. It concerned itself with distinguishing the phases in the organization of human societies, and correctly identifying the place of Greek slavery. The influence of [[Marx]] is decisive: for him the ancient society was characterized by development of private ownership and the dominant (and not secondary as in other pre-capitalist societies) character of slavery as a mode of production. The [[positivism|positivists]] represented by the historian Eduard Meyer (''Slavery in Antiquity'', [[1898]]) were soon to oppose the [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory: according to him slavery was the foundation of Greek democracy. It was thus a legal and social phenomena, and not economic. Historiography developed thought the [[20th century]]; led by authors such as Joseph Vogt, it saw in slavery the conditions for the development of elites. Conversely the theory also demonstrates an opportunity for slaves to join the elite. Finally, he estimates that modern society, founded on humanist values, has surpassed this level of development. 	 
			
-	Currently, Greek slavery remains the subject of historiographical debate; on two questions in particular. Can it be said that ancient Greece was a "slave state"? Did Greek slaves comprise a [[social class]]?
