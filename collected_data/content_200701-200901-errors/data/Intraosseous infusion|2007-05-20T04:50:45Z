'''Intraosseous infusion''' is the process of [[Injection (medicine)|injection]] directly into the [[marrow]] of the bone.  The needle is injected right through the bone and into the soft marrow interior.

This route of fluid and medication administration is an alternate one to the preferred IV route when the latter can't be established in a timely manner especially during cardiac arrest.
