{{DLR Route diagram}}
The '''Docklands Light Railway''' (DLR) is a [[light rail]] system serving the redeveloped [[London Docklands|Docklands]] area of [[East London, England]]. It opened on 31 August 1987 and after extensions reaches north to [[Stratford, London|Stratford]], south to [[Lewisham]], west to [[Bank and Monument stations|Bank]] in the [[City of London]] financial district, and east to [[Beckton]] and [[North Woolwich]]. DLR track and trains are not compatible with those of [[London Underground]], but the two systems share a ticketing system and the DLR is shown on the [[London Underground]] [[Tube map]]. 

The trains are computer-controlled and normally have no driver: a Passenger Service Agent (PSA)<ref>{{cite web

PSAs can also take control of the train in certain circumstances including equipment failure and emergencies. Stations are generally unstaffed except those below ground, which are required to be staffed in case evacuation is needed.

The DLR has been operated and maintained by a franchisee since 1997. The current franchise, due to expire in April 2013, is held by Serco Docklands Ltd., a company  formed jointly by [[Serco Group]] and the former DLR management team.

The DLR system has 39 stations and is expanding. In 2006 it carried over 60 million passengers<ref name="60 million">{{cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/4825.aspx|title=Docklands Light Railway carries 60 million passengers|date=2007-04-04|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=2008-07-09}}</ref>.

==History==
The docks east of London began to decline in the early 1960s as shipping cargo became containerised. The opening of the [[Tilbury]] container docks, further east in [[Essex]], rendered the old docks redundant and in 1980 control of them passed to the British government.
[[Image:DLR tower gateway.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Tower Gateway station was the DLR's original link to central London.]]

The [[Jubilee Line]] of the [[London Underground]] opened in 1979 from [[Stanmore tube station|Stanmore]] to [[Charing Cross tube station|Charing Cross]], intended as the first stage of a cross-town [[Jubilee Line extension|tube line]] beyond Charing Cross to south-east London. 

Although land, for example at [[Ludgate Circus]] and [[Lewisham]], had been reserved for the second stage, the rising cost led in the early 1980s to the project's indefinite postponement.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=London Docklands Development Corporation |title= Various route options for the London Underground dating from the 1960s to 1980s  |url= http://www.lddc-history.org.uk/transport/3tran1.jpg |accessdate=2007-04-17}}</ref>

The [[London Docklands Development Corporation]], needing to provide public transport cheaply for the former docks area to stimulate regeneration, chose a light-rail scheme using surviving docks railway infrastructure to link the [[West India Docks]] to [[Tower Hill]] and to a northern terminus, for which [[Stratford station]], using a track alongside the Great Eastern lines out of London, was preferred over [[Mile End tube station|Mile End]], where the need for tram-like street-running was at variance with the plan to have a fully automated railway. At Stratford a disused bay platform at the west of the station was available, with interchange to the [[Central Line]] and main lines. The growth brought to [[Docklands]] later enabled the [[Jubilee Line]] to be extended in 1999 to [[East London]] by a more southerly route than originally proposed, through Surrey Quays/Docks, [[Canary Wharf]] and the Greenwich peninsula (which was the next regeneration area) to Stratford.

The initial system from [[Tower Gateway DLR station|Tower Gateway]] and from [[Stratford station|Stratford]] to [[Island Gardens DLR station|Island Gardens]], costing £77 million, was opened by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]. 

=== Initial system ===
The initial system was constructed by [[Balfour Beatty]] between 1985 and 1987<ref name="DLRhandbook">{{cite book|last=Jolly |first=Stephen |coauthors=Bayman, Bob |title=Docklands Light Railway Official Handbook|publisher=Capital Transport Publishing|location=Harrow Weald|month=November | year=1986|isbn=0 904711 80 3|accessdate=2008-07-09}}</ref>.

As originally conceived, the system was to be entirely above ground and comprise three branches, with their termini at [[Tower Gateway DLR station|Tower Gateway]], [[Stratford station|Stratford]] and [[Island Gardens DLR station|Island Gardens]]. Most of the track was elevated, either on new lightweight concrete viaducts or on disused railway viaducts, with some use of disused surface-level railway right of way. 

The system was lightweight, with stations and trains only a single articulated vehicle long. The three branches together totalled 8 miles (13 km)<ref name="Railwaytechnology">{{cite web|url=http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/docklands/index.html|title=Docklands Light Railway Extensions, London, United Kingdom|publisher=Railway-Technology.com|accessdate=2008-07-09}}</ref>, with 13 stations, and were connected by a flat triangular junction near [[Poplar]]. Services ran Tower Gateway-Island Gardens and Stratford-Island Gardens, meaning that the north side of the junction was not used in regular passenger service.

The stations on the initial system were mostly to a common design and were constructed out of a standard set of parts.  The principal distinguishing feature of the stations was a relatively short half-cylindrical glazed blue canopy to provide shelter from the rain.

===First extensions===
[[Image:Tower Gateway DLR station 3.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The view from [[Tower Gateway DLR station|Tower Gateway]] looking east prior to rebuilding shows [[Fenchurch Street railway station|Fenchurch Street]] approach tracks to the left, the original DLR line in the centre, and just visible in the distance is a DLR train emerging from the tunnel to [[Bank and Monument stations|Bank]] to the right]]

The initial system proved to have insufficient capacity as the Docklands area developed into a major financial centre and employment zone. Tower Gateway terminus, at the edge of the [[City of London]], attracted criticism for its poor connections.

In response to this, all stations and trains were extended to two-unit lengths, and the system was extended into the heart of the City of London through a tunnel to [[Bank and Monument stations|Bank underground station]], which opened in 1991. This extension diverged from the initial western branch, leaving [[Tower Gateway DLR station|Tower Gateway station]] on a limb. It also rendered the initial car fleet obsolete, as its construction was not suitable for use underground ''(see the [[#Rolling Stock|Rolling Stock]] section below, and the main article [[Docklands Light Railway rolling stock]])''.

At the same time, the areas in the east of [[London Docklands|Docklands]] needed better transport connections to encourage development. This resulted in a fourth branch being constructed, from [[Poplar DLR station|Poplar]] via [[Canning Town station|Canning Town transport interchange]] to [[Beckton DLR station|Beckton]], running along the north side of the Royal Docks complex. Early designs showed several options through the Blackwall Area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lddc-history.org.uk/transport/3tran15.jpg |title=Options for the DLR Beckton Extension route |accessdate=2008-02-23}}</ref> As part of this extension, one side of the original flat triangular junction was replaced with a [[grade separation|grade-separated]] junction west of Poplar, and a new grade-separated junction was created at the divergence of the Stratford and Beckton lines east of Poplar. Poplar station was rebuilt to provide cross-platform interchange between the Stratford and Beckton lines.

The growth of the [[Canary Wharf]] office complex required the redevelopment of [[Canary Wharf DLR station]] from a small wayside station to a large complex with six platforms serving three tracks, beneath a large overall roof and fully integrated into the malls below the office towers. The original DLR station was never completed and was dismantled before the line officially opened.  The automatically-operated trains continued to stop at this location.

===Second stage extensions=== 
[[Image:DLR-WestIndiaDocks-1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A first generation DLR EMU crosses West India Dock, September 1987.]]
Early in the days of the DLR's operation, the [[London Borough of Lewisham]] commissioned a feasibility study of extending the DLR under the Thames to Lewisham.  The outcome of the study led it to push the case for an extension to [[Greenwich]], [[Deptford]] and Lewisham.

The line was planned to leave the original Island Gardens route south of Crossharbour turn-back sidings, dropping gently to Mudchute, a street-level station replacing the high-level Mudchute on the former London & Blackwall viaduct.  Immediately after, the line would drop into tunnel, tracing the route of the viaduct to Island Gardens, a just-below-surface station reached by a staircase.  Crossing the Thames, the line would have a station in the centre of Greenwich, thereafter rising to the surface in deep tunnel and then cut-and-cover to a stop at the main-line [[Greenwich station]], the southbound DLR track offering convenient cross-platform interchange with the city-bound main line.  From here, the line would snake across concrete viaducts to Deptford, Elverson Road (at street level on a road close to Lewisham town centre), terminating in two platforms between and below the main-line platforms at Lewisham, within walking distance of the town shopping centre, with bus services stopping directly outside the station.

The Lewisham extension, authorised as above, opened in 1999. With its opening the DLR took its first steps from being a local people-mover to a truly important backbone of the east/south-east London transport system.  

On 2 December 2005, a new eastward branch, running along the southern side of the [[Royal Docks]] complex, opened from Canning Town to [[King George V DLR station|King George V]] via [[London City Airport DLR station|London City Airport]].  Further extension to Woolwich, already shown on London tube maps, to be built at or close to the future stop on the [[Crossrail]] line to Abbey Wood via West India and Royal Docks, will contribute to this growth<ref name="map">{{cite web|url=http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/docklands/docklands11.html|title=An extension to the DLR is being built between King George V and Woolwich Arsenal. Another extension is planned from Canning Town to Stratford International.|publisher=Railway-Technology.com|accessdate=2008-07-09}}</ref>.

==Current system== 
[[Image:dlr.canary.wharf.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A Docklands Light Railway train enters [[Canary Wharf]] from the south.]]

The DLR is now 19 miles (31 km) long<ref name="History">{{cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/modesoftransport/dlr/1538.aspx|title=History|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=2008-07-09}}</ref>. There are five branches: to [[Lewisham station|Lewisham]] in the south, [[Stratford station|Stratford]] in the north, [[Beckton DLR station|Beckton]] and [[King George V DLR station|King George V]] in the east, and to Central London, splitting to serve [[Bank and Monument stations|Bank]] and [[Tower Gateway DLR station|Tower Gateway]]. Although the system allows many different combinations of routes, at present the following four are operated in normal service:

* Stratford to Lewisham
* Bank to Lewisham
* Bank to King George V
* Tower Gateway to Beckton (curtailed to Canning Town during Tower Gateway's rebuilding)

Trains during the peak on the Stratford line turn back at [[Crossharbour and London Arena DLR station|Crossharbour]] rather than continuing to Lewisham. There are also occasional trains from [[Tower Gateway DLR station|Tower Gateway]] to Crossharbour and [[Lewisham station|Lewisham]]. Every train serves every station on its route.

The northern and southern branches terminate at the National Rail (main line) stations at Stratford and Lewisham. Other direct interchanges between the DLR and National Rail are at [[Limehouse station|Limehouse]] and Greenwich.

===Stations===
[[Image:DLR Westferry aerial view.jpg|thumb|right|An eastbound train leaving Westferry Station.]]
Many DLR stations are elevated, with others at street level, in a cutting, or underground. Access to the platforms is normally by staircase and lift, very few stations having escalators. From the outset the network has been fully accessible to wheelchairs. The stations have high platforms, matching the floor height of the cars, allowing easy access for passengers with wheelchairs or pushchairs.

Most of the stations are of a modular design dating back to the initial system, albeit extended and improved over the years. This design has two side platforms, each with separate access from the street, and platform canopies with a distinctive rounded roof design. Stations are unstaffed, except the underground stations at [[Bank and Monument stations|Bank]], [[Island Gardens DLR station|Island Gardens]] and [[Cutty Sark DLR station|Cutty Sark]] (for safety reasons), and a few of the busier interchange stations.

See [[List of Docklands Light Railway stations]].

===DLR art===
On 3 July 2007, DLR officially launched<ref>{{cite news |publisher=Transport for London |date=2007-07-03 |url=http://pressroom.dlr.co.uk/news/details.asp?id=139 |title= Docklands Light Railway draws up public arts strategy |accessdate=2008-02-23}}</ref> their own [http://www.dlrart.co.uk/ art programme] similar to that in place on the [[London Underground]], [[Platform for Art]]. Alan Williams was appointed to produce the first temporary commission. Called "sidetrack", it portrays the ordinary and extraordinary sights, often unfamiliar to passengers, on the system and was displayed throughout the network.

===Fares and ticketing===
Ticketing is part of the London fare zone system, and [[Travelcard]]s that cover the correct zones are valid. 

There are one-day and season DLR-only "Rover" tickets available, plus a one-day DLR "Rail and River Rover" ticket for use on the DLR and on City Cruises river boats. [[Oyster card|Oyster]] Pre-Pay is also available &mdash; passengers need to both touch in and touch out on the platform readers or pass through the automatic gates.

Tickets must be purchased from ticket machines at the entrance to the platforms, and are required before the passenger enters the platform. There are no ticket barriers in DLR-only stations, and correct ticketing is enforced by on-train checks by the PSA. There are barriers at [[Bank and Monument stations|Bank]], [[Canning Town station|Canning Town]] and [[Stratford station|Stratford]], where the DLR platforms are within the barrier lines of a [[London Underground]] or [[National Rail]] station.

The DLR is used by up to a hundred thousand people daily, with around 60 million journeys yearly<ref name="60 million" />.

==Accidents and incidents==
===Overrun of station buffers===
On 10 March 1987, before the railway opened, a train crashed through station [[buffer stop]]s at the original high-level terminus [[Island Gardens]] station and was left hanging from the end of the elevated track. The accident was caused by unauthorised tests being run before accident-preventing modifications had been installed. The train was being driven manually at the time.<ref name=Risks1>[http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/5.29.html#subj3 London Docklands Light Railway; Northern Line's Dot-Matrix Indicators] [[RISKS Digest]] Volume 5 Issue 29 Article 3, 13 August 1987</ref><ref name=ModernRailways1>Report on the Docklands Light Railway Accident Which Occurred at Island Gardens Station on 10 March 1987, ''[[Modern Railways]]'', May 1987</ref><ref name=ModernRailways2>"'Unauthorised Tests' Caused DLR Crash", ''[[Modern Railways]]'', June 1987</ref>

===Service difficulties with the Royal train===
In July 1987, a series of minor incidents marred the operation of the royal train (number E2R) carrying [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] as part of the ceremonies marking the opening of the line.  The train had been manually dispatched from its starting point at Island Gardens station five minutes early because of the early arrival of the royal party.  The train was on automatic control and so, being ahead of schedule, was held at the next station (Mudchute) for a few minutes before the driver reverted to manual control "to speed the Royal passage" and continued on to Poplar station, where the royal party were to disembark.  A member of the royal security detail used the emergency exit to leave the train before it had stopped, causing the train to make an emergency stop short of its normal position and out of range of the docking beacon that marked its arrival point. The train doors would not open, impeding the Queen's exit for several minutes.<ref name=Risks2>[http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/5.23.html#subj4.1 Railway automation], Stephen Colwill, [[RISKS Digest]] Volume 5 Issue 23 Article 4, 31 July 1987</ref><ref name=Risks3>[http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/5.52.html#subj2.1 Computer's Normal Operation Delays Royal Visit], Mark Brader, [[RISKS Digest]] Volume 5 Issue 52 Article 2, 29 October 1987</ref><ref name=ModernRailways3>"Opening of the Docklands Light Railway," Roger Ford, ''[[Modern Railways]]'', September 1987</ref>

===Collision at West India Quay bridge===
On 22 April 1991, two trains collided at a junction on the [[West India Quay]] bridge during morning [[rush hour]], requiring a shutdown of the entire system and evacuation of the involved passengers by ladder.<ref name=Risks5>[http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/11.52.html#subj1.1 Another commuter train wreck in London], Jonathan I.

===South Quay bombing===
{{Main|1996 Docklands bombing}} 
On 9 February 1996, the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] exploded a [[lorry]] under a bridge near [[South Quay DLR station|South Quay]], killing two people and injuring many others. This number would have been higher if not for advance warning. The blast did £85 million damage and marked an end to the IRA ceasefire.  Significant disruption was caused to DLR services, and a train was left stranded at Island Gardens station, unable to move until the track was rebuilt.



==Rolling stock==
[[Image:Dlr emu at tower gateway.jpg|thumb|left|A DLR train is headed by B2K stock car 96 at [[Tower Gateway DLR station|Tower Gateway station]]]]

{{Main|Docklands Light Railway rolling stock}}

The DLR is operated by high-floor, bi-directional, single-articulated cars with four doors on each side, each train consisting of two cars. The cars have a small driver’s console concealed behind a locked panel at each car end from which the PSA can drive the car, and no driver’s cab. Consoles at each door opening allow the PSA to control door closure and make announcements whilst patrolling the train. Because of the absence of a driver’s position, the fully-glazed car ends provide an unusual forward (or rear) view for passengers. The current stock has a top speed of 80 km/h (50mph).

Despite having high floors and being highly automated, the cars are derived from a German [[light rail|light-rail]] design intended for use in systems with street running. All the cars that have operated on the system to date look similar, but there have been several different types, some still in service and others sold to other operators.
{{clear}}

==Signalling technology==
Originally the DLR used [[Railway signalling|signalling]] based on a [[Railway signalling#Fixed block|fixed-block]] technology developed by [[General Electric Company plc|GEC-General Signal]] and [[General Railway Signal]].<ref name="DLRhandbook"/> This was replaced in 1994 with a [[Railway signalling#Moving block|moving-block]] system developed by [[Alcatel]], called [[SelTrac]].The SelTrac system was bought by [[Thales Group|Thales]] in 2007 and current updates are being provided by Thales Signalling Solutions. The same technology is used for some other [[rapid transit]] systems, including Vancouver's [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]],Toronto's SRT, San Francisco's Municipal Railway ([[MUNI]]) and Hong Kong's MTR. Transmissions occur between each train's onboard computer and the control centre at Poplar. If this link is broken, the train stops until it is authorised to move again. If the whole system fails the train can run at only 20 km/h for safety until the system is restored. Emergency brakes can be applied if the train breaks the speed limit during manual control, or if the train leaves the station when the route has not been set<ref name="Railwaytechnology" />

==Recent developments==
===New platforms at Stratford===
:'''''Status''' - Opened''
[[Image:Stratford DLR 4a 4b e.JPG|thumb|right|New platforms 4a and 4b at Stratford]]
The DLR originally had only one narrow two-car platform at [[Stratford station|Stratford]], which limited capacity and hindered interchange with other services at the station. This closed on 15 June 2007 and has been replaced by two new three-car platforms: the first new platform opened on 18 June 2007<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/5317.aspx|title=New DLR Platform opens at Stratford|date=2007-06-18|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=2008-06-29}}</ref>and the second opened on 9 December 2007.<ref name="Langdon Park">{{cite news|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/6816.aspx|title=New Docklands Light Railway station opens at Langdon Park|date=2007-12-10|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=2008-06-29}}</ref>

=== Langdon Park station ===
:'''''Status''' - Opened'' 

A station at [[Langdon Park DLR station|Langdon Park]] between [[All Saints DLR station|All Saints]] and [[Devons Road DLR station|Devons Road]] stations opened on 9 December 2007.<ref name="Langdon Park" />


==Future developments==
With the development of the eastern Docklands as part of the ‘[[Thames Gateway]]’ initiative and London’s successful bid for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], several extensions and enhancements are under construction, being planned or being discussed:<ref name="dlrdev">{{cite web|url=http://developments.dlr.co.uk/index.asp|title=Docklands Light Railway - Development Projects|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=2008-07-09}}</ref>.

=== Woolwich Arsenal extension ===
:'''''Status''' - Under Construction - expected opening: Monday 12th January 2009''
[[Image:Woolwich_Arsenal_Extension_map.PNG|thumb|Route of Woolwich Arsenal extension: [[OpenStreetMap]]]] 
This will extend the [[London City Airport]] branch from [[King George V DLR station|King George V]] to [[Woolwich Arsenal railway station|Woolwich Arsenal]] and is due to open in January 2009<ref>[url=http://woolwich.dlr.co.uk]</ref>. The projected cost of £150 million, due to a required second DLR tunnel crossing of the [[River Thames]], is being met by [[Private Finance Initiative]] funding. Construction began in June 2005, and the tunnels were completed on 23 July 2007.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://pressroom.dlr.co.uk/news/details.asp?id=141|title= Tunnel extending Docklands Light Railway to Woolwich completed|date=2007-07-23|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=2008-06-29}}</ref>.

===Upgrading Bank - Lewisham route to 3-car trains===
:'''''Status''' - Under Construction''

The section between [[Bank and Monument stations|Bank]] and [[Lewisham]] is being upgraded to allow operation of 3-car trains to increase capacity. More frequent trains were considered as an alternative, but it was found that the necessary signalling changes would be as expensive as upgrading to handle longer trains with fewer benefits<ref name="dlrcapen">{{cite web|url=http://developments.dlr.co.uk/enhancements/capacity/index.asp|title=Docklands Light Railway - Three-carriage Capacity Enhancement Project|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=2008-07-09}}</ref>

As much of this section dates from the initial system built for single-car operation, the work involves both strengthening viaducts to support the additional weight of the longer trains and lengthening platforms at most stations.

The exceptions are:

* [[South Quay DLR station|South Quay station]], which is being replaced by a new station 200m to the east, as nearby curves preclude lengthening.

* [[Canary Wharf DLR station|Canary Wharf]], [[Heron Quays DLR station|Heron Quays]], [[Island Gardens DLR station|Island Gardens]] and [[Bank and Monument stations|Bank]] are already able to accommodate 3-car trains.

* The below-ground [[Cutty Sark DLR station|Cutty Sark station]] will not be extended, due to the cost and the risk to nearby historic buildings. Use of [[Selective Door Operation]] (SDO) has been approved by the [[Railway Inspectorate]] instead.

[[Mudchute DLR station|Mudchute]] will gain a third platform, with all the platforms gaining a full-length canopy<ref>{{cite web|url=http://londonconnections.blogspot.com/2008/04/mudchute-third-platform.html|title=Mudchute third platform|date=2008-04-11|publisher=London Connections|accessdate=2008-06-29}}</ref>.

The £200m works contract was awarded on 3 May 2007<ref>{{cite news|url=http://pressroom.dlr.co.uk/news/details.asp?id=133|title= Extra carriage on every DLR train|date=2007-05-03|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=2008-06-29}}</ref>. Work started in 2007 and is due to be complete in late 2009. Following some signalling work at Bank, 3-car trains should be running early in 2010.

====Other stations affected====
Two stations not on the Bank – Lewisham route are included in the plans so as to improve operational flexibility. [[Poplar DLR station|Poplar station]] has already been lengthened in advance of the work elsewhere to confirm that the proposed method of construction is satisfactory. To enable use by 3-car trains [[Tower Gateway DLR station|Tower Gateway]] is closed until February 2009<ref>[http://improvements.dlr.co.uk/project_updates/towergateway.asp] Tower Gateway station temporary closure</ref> to be converted from its current two-track terminal layout to a single line with two platforms, the southern one for boarding passengers, the northern for alighting<ref>[http://www.planning.cityoflondon.gov.uk:90/WAM/doc/Drawing-78475.pdf?extension=.pdf&wmTransparency=0&id=78475&wmLocation=0&location=livevolume1&contentType=application%2Fpdf&wmName=&pageCount=1 Plans submitted to the City of London]</ref>.

===Stratford International extension / North London Line conversion===
:'''''Status''' - Under Construction''

An extension is being built from Canning Town to the new [[Stratford International station]].  This takes over part of the [[North London Line]] infrastructure and will link the Docklands area with domestic and international high-speed services on [[High Speed 1]]. It is projected to open early in 2010 and is an important part of the transport improvement package for the [[2012 Olympic Games]], which will largely be held on a site adjoining Stratford International. Passengers who originally took the North London line towards North Woolwich will be able to change at Stratford to the extension and get to North Woolwich via the London City Airport branch.

Four new stations will be built: [[Star Lane DLR station|Star Lane]] (formerly Cody Road), [[Abbey Road DLR station|Abbey Road]], [[Stratford High Street DLR station|Stratford High Street]] (formerly Stratford Market) and Stratford International, as well as serving [[West Ham station|West Ham]] and [[Stratford station|Stratford]]. All stations will accommodate 3-car trains. An important part of the project is to build new platforms at Stratford for the North London Line so that the site of the current platforms (1 and 2) is available for the new DLR platforms.

As part of the [[Transport and Works Act 1992|Transport & Works Act]] (TWA) application, [[Royal Victoria DLR station|Royal Victoria station]] on the Beckton branch will be extended to accommodate 3-car trains, with a third platform to enable trains to reverse there, using land released by the closure of this section of the parallel North London line.
 
The first contract for construction work was awarded on 10 January 2007 <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/3343.aspx|title=Major contract award signals start of work on DLR Stratford International Extension|date=2007-01-10|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=2008-06-29}}</ref> and construction work started in mid 2007. The extension is due to open in mid 2010.

===Upgrading other lines to 3-car trains===
:'''''Status''' - Under Construction

When work to allow 3-car trains between [[Bank and Monument stations|Bank]] and [[Lewisham station|Lewisham]] is complete, and the only two parts of the network unable to take 3-car trains are [[Poplar DLR station|Poplar]] to [[Stratford station|Stratford]] and Poplar to [[Beckton DLR station|Beckton]]. Approval has been given for upgrading those two sections between 2008 and 2010 and for further grade-separation at Delta Junction north of [[West India Quay DLR station|West India Quay]] to eliminate the conflict between services to Stratford and from Bank. This will permit possible new services from [[Beckton]] and [[Woolwich]] to terminate at [[Canary Wharf]] or [[Lewisham]], but southbound services from Bank will be unable to stop at West India Quay due to the removal of the outer platform. 

Work has been proceeding with this project concurrently with the original upgrade work and all the work involved is generally now treated as one combined project.

TfL has stated that due to lack of committed funding the Beckton branch will not be upgraded to 3-car operation at the moment<ref>{{cite news|url=http://pressroom.dlr.co.uk/archive/details.asp?id=142|title= Docklands Light Railway to increase capacity by 50 per cent with three-car trains|date=2007-07-31|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=2008-06-29}}</ref>.

===Dagenham Dock extension===
{{main|Docklands Light Railway extension to Dagenham Dock}}
:'''''Status''' - Cancelled (as of November 2008)''

This proposed extension from [[Gallions Reach DLR station|Gallions Reach]] to [[Dagenham Dock railway station|Dagenham Dock]] via the riverside at Barking would connect the Barking Reach area, a formerly industrial area now due to be a  major redevelopment as part of the [[London Riverside]], with the Docklands. It would cover major developments at Creekmouth, Barking Riverside, Dagenham Dock Opportunity Area, and five stations are planned, at Beckton Riverside station, Creekmouth, Barking Riverside, Goresbrook (formerly Dagenham Vale) and Dagenham Dock. The extension is key if [[English Partnerships]]' plan is to work. As shown in DLR's first consultation leaflet,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://developments.dlr.co.uk/pdf/extensions/dagenham/dagenham_consultation_leaflet2.pdf |title=DLR Barking Riverside consultation document |publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=2008-02-23 |format= pdf}}</ref> there are proposals for the DLR to extend further than [[Dagenham Dock]], possibly to [[Dagenham Heathway tube station|Dagenham Heathway]] or [[Rainham railway station|Rainham]].

Construction wasn't expected to start until 2013 and the earliest expected completion date was to be 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/corporate/Agenda-08-02-06.pdf|title= TfL Board meeting papers February 2008|accessdate=2008-02-13 |format= pdf}}</ref>  However the [[Financial crisis of 2007-2008|credit crunch]] has meant that TfL have requested a delay to the public enquiry whilst funding is clarified.  Given that the purpose of the extension is to serve as yet unbuilt homes it would seem that it is now very difficult to predict timescales for this project.

===Limehouse station interchange===
:'''''Status''' - Under construction''

[[Limehouse station]] currently has an awkward interchange between the DLR platforms and the National Rail platforms served by [[c2c]], as passengers have to pass up and down flights of stairs.  To remedy this a bridge is being built to connect to two lines and is due for completion by the end of 2008.<ref name="Limehouse">{{cite news|url=http://pressroom.dlr.co.uk/news/details.asp?id=161|title= DLR Limehouse station link on the way|date=2008-04-14|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=2008-06-29}}</ref>

===Thames Wharf station===
:'''''Status''' - Proposed''

This station had been included as potential future development on the '''London City Airport extension''' since it was first planned. It would be between [[Canning Town station|Canning Town]] and [[West Silvertown DLR station|West Silvertown]], due west of the western end of [[Royal Victoria Dock]]. Since the station's intended purpose is to serve the surrounding area (currently a mix of [[brownfield]] and run-down industrial sites) when it is regenerated, the development is indefinitely on hold due to the area being safeguarded for the [[Silvertown Link]], a new Thames river crossing proposed for opening by 2015<ref name="atoproj41">{{cite web|url=http://www.alwaystouchout.com/project/41|title=Silvertown Link|date=2006-11-18|publisher=AlwaysTouchOut.com|accessdate=2008-07-09}}</ref>

===Connaught Road / Silvertown Interchange station===
:'''''Status''' - Proposed''

A site near to [[London City Airport]] has been identified as a possible additional station on the London City Airport extension. It would be a possible interchange with [[Crossrail]], between [[London City Airport DLR station|London City Airport]] and [[Pontoon Dock DLR station|Pontoon Dock]]. However, no plans have emerged as to when this station is to be planned and built. The original extension was designed to allow a station to be built here. It may be located south of the Connaught Crossing<ref name="atoproj9">{{cite web|url=http://www.alwaystouchout.com/project/9|title=DLR to City Airport|publisher=AlwaysTouchOut.com|accessdate=2008-07-09}}</ref>

===Charing Cross extension===
:'''''Status''' - Proposed'' - 2026

In February 2006 a proposal to extend the DLR to [[Charing Cross tube station|Charing Cross station]] from [[Bank and Monument stations|Bank]] DLR branch was revealed.<ref name = "mrmarch"/> The idea, originating from a DLR "Horizon Study", is at a very early stage at the moment, but would involve extending the line from Bank in bored tunnels under Central London to the Charing Cross [[Jubilee Line|Jubilee line]] platforms, which would be brought back to public use.  These platforms are now on a spur off the current Jubilee line and are not used by passenger trains.

While not confirmed it is probable that the scheme would also use the existing overrun tunnels between the Charing Cross Jubilee platforms and a location slightly to the west of [[Aldwych tube station|Aldwych]]. These tunnels were intended to be incorporated into the abandoned Phase 2 of the ''Fleet Line'' (Phase 1 became the original Jubilee Line, prior to the Jubilee Line Extension). However they would need some enlargement because DLR [[loading gauge|gauge]] is larger than tube gauge and current safety regulations would require an emergency walkway to be provided in the tunnel.

The two reasons driving the proposal are capacity problems at Bank, having basically one interchange between the DLR and the central portion of [[London Underground|Underground]], and the difficult journeys faced by passengers from [[Kent]] and South Coast between their rail termini and the DLR. Intermediate stations would be at [[City Thameslink]] and [[Aldwych]], for future connection with the [[Cross River Tram]].

===Euston/King's Cross extension===
:'''''Status''' - Proposed''

During the last Horizon study, a possible extension was considered from Bank towards [[Euston railway station|Euston]] or [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross]].<ref name="Hackney Council Minutes">[http://www.hackney.gov.uk/hst_-_section_5.pdf Chapter 5: Major Transport and Regeneration Projects, item 5.6.3]</ref> The main benefit of this extension will be tapping into an area that doesn't have a direct link to the Canary Wharf site, either existing or proposed. This would create a new artery in central London and help relieve the Northern and Circle lines. There are no official plans for possible stations except towards [[Farringdon station|Farringdon]], possibly using some of the [[Thameslink Programme|soon-to-be-disused]] [[Thameslink]] infrastructure.

===Works contingent on Crossrail===
:'''''Status''' - Proposed''

When [[Crossrail]] gets built, one of its tunnel portals will be on the current site of Pudding Mill Lane station. Between City Mill River and the River Lea, the DLR will be diverted onto a new viaduct to be built further south, including a replacement station. The opportunity may be taken to eliminate the only significant section of single track on the system, between Bow Church and Stratford<ref name="mrmarch">Ian Allan Publishing. ''Modern Railways''. March 2006''.</ref>, although there is no provision for works beyond the realigned section in the [[Crossrail Act 2008|Crossrail Act]]. Another Crossrail tunnel portal will be located between Royal Victoria and Custom House, again requiring the DLR to be diverted to the south.

Crossrail will interchange with the DLR at Custom House, at Stratford and at West India Quay with Crossrail's Isle of Dogs station. Custom House station will be completely rebuilt.  If a Crossrail station is built in the City Airport area, a new DLR station could be built alongside (see ''Connaught Road/Silvertown Interchange station'' section above)<ref name="atoproj1">{{cite web|url=http://www.alwaystouchout.com/project/1#Benchmark|title=Crossrail|date=2008-02-20|publisher=AlwaysTouchOut.com|accessdate=2008-07-09}}</ref>.

===Lewisham to Catford extension===
:'''''Status''' - Proposed'' - 2026

This extension was looked at during the latest Horizon Study. The route would follow the [[Southeastern (train operating company)|Southeastern]] line and terminate between [[Catford railway station|Catford station]] and [[Catford Bridge railway station|Catford Bridge station]]. However early plans showed problems due to Lewisham DLR station being only marginally higher than the busy A20 road which impedes any proposed extension. The plan is however being revised<ref name="atoproj129">{{cite web|url=http://www.alwaystouchout.com/project/129|title=DLR to Catford|date=2007-10-27|publisher=Always Touch Out|accessdate=2008-07-09}}</ref>. When the Lewisham extension was first completed there were proposals to continue further to [[Beckenham]] to link it up with the [[Tramlink]] system. However, the way in which Lewisham DLR was built impede this possible extension and it would prove costly to redevelop.
