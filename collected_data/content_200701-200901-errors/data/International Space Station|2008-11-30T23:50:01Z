The space station is a joint project among the space agencies of the [[United States]] ([[NASA]]), [[Russia]] ([[Russian Federal Space Agency|RKA]]), [[Japan]] ([[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency|JAXA]]), [[Canada]] ([[Canadian Space Agency|CSA]]) and eleven [[Europe]]an countries ([[European Space Agency|ESA]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaHS/partstates.html|title=Human Spaceflight and Exploration - European Participating States|accessdate=2005-07-03|publisher=ESA}} Ten of Europe's member states are currently participating, but [[Austria]], [[Finland]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Portugal]], and the [[United Kingdom]] chose not to participate; [[Greece]] and [[Luxembourg]] joined ESA later.</ref> The [[Brazilian Space Agency]] (AEB, [[Brazil]]) participates through a separate contract with NASA.

The ISS is a continuation of several other previously planned space stations; Russia's [[Mir-2|''Mir'' 2]], the US [[Space Station Freedom|Space Station ''Freedom'']], the European [[Columbus (ISS module)|''Columbus'']] laboratory and the Japanese [[Japanese Experiment Module|''Kibō'']] laboratory. The projected completion date is 2011, with the station remaining in operation at least until 2016. {{As of|2008}}, the ISS is larger than any previous space station.

The ISS has been continuously staffed since the first resident crew, [[Expedition 1]], entered the station on November 2, 2000, thereby providing a permanent human presence in space. The crew of [[Expedition 18]] are currently aboard. At present the station has a capacity for a crew of three, however, in order to fulfil an active research program, beginning with [[Expedition 20]], it will be staffed by a resident crew of six.<ref>{{cite web|title=International Space Station Approaches Key Turning Point|url=http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/iss_update_010831.html|publisher=space.com|first=Todd|last=Halvorson|date=August 31, 2001|accessdate=2008-03-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=NASA Assigns Space Station Crews, Updates Expedition Numbering|url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/nov/HQ_08-306_Expedition_crews.html|publisher=NASA|first=Katherine|last=Trinidad|coauthors=Nicole Cloutier-Lemasters|accessdate=2008-11-22|date=November 21, 2008}}</ref> Early crew members all came from the Russian and American space programs, until German ESA astronaut [[Thomas Reiter]] joined the [[Expedition 13]] crew in July 2006, becoming the first crew member from another [[List of space agencies|space agency]]. The station has been visited by [[List of International Space Station visitors|astronauts from 16 different nations]], and was the destination of the first five [[Space tourism|space tourists]].

The station is serviced primarily by the US [[Space Shuttle]] and the Russian manned [[Soyuz spacecraft]] and unmanned [[Progress spacecraft]]. On March 9, 2008, the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) launched an [[Ariane 5]] with the first [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]], ''[[Jules Verne ATV|Jules Verne]]'', an unmanned spacecraft which carried over 8,000 kilograms of cargo to the ISS. Several other servicing vehicles are also in various stages of planning.

With its origins in the [[Cold War]], the International Space Station represents a union of several different space station projects from various different nations. During the early 1980s, NASA planned to launch a modular space station, called [[Space Station Freedom|''Freedom'']], as a counterpart to the Soviet ''[[Salyut program|Salyut]]'' and ''[[Mir]]'' space stations, whilst meanwhile the Soviets were planning a replacement for ''Mir'', due to be constructed during the 1990s, called [[Mir-2|''Mir''-2]].<ref name="SSSM">

Due to budgetary and design constraints, ''Freedom'' never progressed past mockups and minor component tests, and, with the fall of the Soviet Union, ending the Cold War and [[Space Race]], it was nearly cancelled by the US [[House of Representatives]]. The post-Soviet economic chaos in [[Russia]] also led to the postponement and eventual cancellation of ''Mir''-2, with only the base block of that station, DOS-8, having been constructed.<ref name="SSSM" />

The similar difficulties faced by the US, Russia and other nations with plans for space stations prompted US administration officials to start negotiations with international partners in Europe, Russia, Japan and Canada in the early 1990s in order to build a truly international space station. In June 1992, [[President of the United States|American president]] [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[President of Russia|Russian president]] [[Boris Yeltsin]] agreed to join hands in [[space exploration]] by signing the "Agreement between the United States of America and the Russian Federation Concerning Cooperation in the Exploration and Use of [[Outer space|Outer Space]] for Peaceful Purposes". The agreement called for the setting up a short, joint space program, during which one US [[astronaut]] would board the Russian space station ''Mir'' and two Russian [[astronaut|cosmonauts]] would board a [[Space Shuttle]]. In September 1993, however, American Vice-president [[Al Gore]] and Russian prime minister [[Viktor Chernomyrdin]] announced plans for a new space station, later to be called the International Space Station.<ref name="gao">{{cite web |url=http://archive.gao.gov/t2pbat3/151975.pdf |title=''Space Station: Impact of the Expanded Russian Role on Funding and Research''|accessdate=2006-11-03 |last=Heivilin|first=Donna M.|year=June 21, 1994 |month=June |format=PDF |work= |publisher=GAO |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> They also agreed that, in preparation for this new project, America would be largely involved in the ''Mir'' program in the years ahead, as part of an agreement that later became the [[Shuttle-Mir Program]].<ref>

It was planned to combine the proposed space stations of all participating space agencies; ''Freedom'', ''Mir''-2 (with DOS-8 later becoming [[Zvezda (ISS)|''Zvezda'']]), [[European Space Agency|ESA's]] [[Columbus (ISS module)|''Columbus'']], and the Japanese [[Japanese Experiment Module|''Kibō'']] laboratory. The first module, ''[[Zarya]]'', was launched in 1998, and construction was expected to be complete by 2003.

===Assembly===
{{main|Assembly of the International Space Station}}
{{see also|ISS assembly sequence}}
[[Image:STS-124 Garan EVA2.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Astronaut [[Ron Garan]] during an ISS assembly spacewalk on [[STS-124]].]]
The [[assembly of the International Space Station]] is a major [[aerospace engineering]] endeavour. When assembly is complete the ISS will have a pressurised volume of approximately 1,000&nbsp;m³ (35,300&nbsp;cubic feet). Assembly began in November 1998, and {{as of|2008|7|lc=on}} the station is approximately 85% complete.

The first segment of the ISS, the [[Zarya|''Zarya'' FGB]], was launched into orbit 20 November 1998 on a Russian [[Proton (rocket)|Proton rocket]], and was followed two weeks later by the first of three 'node' modules, [[Unity (ISS module)|''Unity'']], launched aboard [[STS-88]]. This bare 2-module core of the ISS remained unmanned for the next one and a half years, until in July 2000 the Russian module ''Zvezda'' was added, allowing a maximum crew of three astronauts or cosmonauts to be on the ISS permanently - the first resident crew, [[Expedition 1]], was sent that November. The year 2000 also saw the arrival of two segments of the station's [[Integrated Truss Structure]], the Z1 and P6 truss, together providing the embryonic station with communications, guidance, electrical grounding (on Z1) and power via a pair of solar array wings (on P6).

Over the next two years the station continued to expand, with a [[Soyuz (rocket)|Soyuz rocket]] delivering the [[Pirs docking compartment|''Pirs'' docking compartment]] and Space Shuttles ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'' and ''Endeavour'' between them carrying the [[Destiny (ISS module)|''Destiny'' laboratory]] and [[Quest Joint Airlock|''Quest'' airlock]] to orbit, in addition to the station's robot arm, ''[[Canadarm2]]'', and several more segments of the truss structure.

The ambitious expansion schedule was brought to an abrupt halt, however, following the destruction of the {{OV|102}} on [[STS-107]]. The resulting hiatus in the [[Space Shuttle program]] led to a halt in station assembly until the launch of ''Discovery'' on [[STS-114]] in 2005.

The official Return to Assembly was marked by the delivery by ''Atlantis'', flying [[STS-115]], of the station's second set of solar arrays, which were followed by several more truss segments and a third set of arrays on [[STS-116]], [[STS-117]] and [[STS-118]]. This major expansion of the station's power generating abilities meant that more pressurised modules could be accommodated, and as a result the [[Harmony (ISS module)|''Harmony'']] node and [[Columbus (ISS module)|''Columbus'']] European laboratory were added, followed shortly by the first two components of ''Kibō'', the [[Japanese Experiment Module]].

{{As of|2008|7}}, the station consists of ten pressurised modules, and all but one of the components of the Integrated Truss Structure. Awaiting launch are the station's final set of solar arrays (set for delivery on [[STS-119]]), the final section of ''Kibō'', the American [[Node 3]], and the [[European Robotic Arm]], in addition to several Russian modules. Also awaiting launch is the [[Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer]], recently manifested on what is currently the final Space Shuttle flight, [[STS-134]]. Assembly is expected to be completed by 2011, by which point the station will have a mass in excess of 400&nbsp;[[tonne]]s (440&nbsp;[[short ton]]s).<ref name="ISStD" /><ref name="Manifest" />

===Pressurised modules===
The ISS is currently under construction, and will eventually consist of fourteen pressurised modules with a combined volume of around 1,000&nbsp;m³. These modules include laboratories, docking compartments, airlocks, nodes and living quarters, nine of which are already in orbit, with the remaining five awaiting launch. Each module is launched either by [[Space Shuttle]], [[Proton (rocket)|Proton rocket]] or [[Soyuz (rocket)|Soyuz rocket]], and is listed below along with its purpose, launch date and mass.

===Power supply===
[[Image:ISS on 20 August 2001.jpg|thumb|The ISS in 2001, showing the solar panels on ''Zarya'' and ''Zvezda'', in addition to the US P6 solar arrays.]]
{{main|Electrical system of the International Space Station}}
The source of [[Electric power|electrical power]] for the ISS is the [[Sun]]: light is converted into electricity through the use of [[Photovoltaic module|solar arrays]]. Before assembly flight 4A (Space Suttle mission [[STS-97]], November 30, 2000) the only power source was the Russian solar panels attached to the ''[[Zarya]]'' and [[Zvezda (ISS)|''Zvezda'']] modules: the Russian segment of the station uses 28&nbsp;[[volt]]s [[direct current|DC]] (as does the [[Space Shuttle]]). In the remainder of the station, electricity is provided by the solar arrays attached to the truss at a [[voltage]] ranging from 130 to 180 volts DC. The power is then stabilized and distributed at 160&nbsp;volts DC, before finally being converted to the user-required 124&nbsp;volts DC - this [[High voltage|high-voltage]] distribution line allows for smaller power lines, reducing weight. Power can be shared between the two segments of the station using converters, and this feature is essential since the cancellation of the Russian [[Science Power Platform]], as the Russian segment will depend on the US built solar arrays for power.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/spacestation/systems/solar_arrays.html|title=Boeing: Integrated Defense Systems - NASA Systems - International Space Station - Solar Power|accessdate=2006-06-05|publisher=Boeing}}</ref>

The solar array normally tracks the Sun to maximize the amount of solar power. The array is about 375&nbsp;m² (450 yd²) in area and {{convert|58|m|ft|0}} long. In the fully-complete configuration, the solar arrays track the sun in each orbit by rotating the ''alpha [[gimbal]]''; while the ''beta gimbal'' adjusts for the angle of the sun from the orbital plane. (Until the [[Integrated Truss Structure|main truss structure]] arrived, the arrays were in a temporary position perpendicular to the final orientation, and in this configuration, as shown in the image to the right, the beta gimbal was used for the main solar tracking.) Another tracking option, [[Night Glider mode]], can be used to reduce the effects of drag produced by the tenuous upper atmosphere through which the station flies by orienting the solar arrays edgewise to the velocity vector.

===Attitude control===
The attitude (orientation) of the station is maintained by either of two mechanisms. Normally, a system using several [[control moment gyroscope]]s (CMGs) keeps the station oriented, with ''Destiny'' forward of ''Unity'', the P truss on the port side and ''Pirs'' on the earth-facing (nadir) side. When the CMG system becomes saturated (a situation whereby a CMG exceeds its operational range or cannot track a series of rapid movements, and stops working) it can lose its ability to control station attitude. In this event, the Russian attitude control system is designed to take over automatically, using [[thruster]]s to maintain station attitude and allowing the CMG system to desaturate, a situation which has occurred once, during [[Expedition 10]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/spacenews/reports/issreports/2005/iss05-7.html | title = International Space Station Status Report #05-7 | date = February 11, 2005 | publisher = NASA|accessdate=2008-11-23}}</ref> When a Space Shuttle is docked to the station, it can also be used to maintain station attitude. This procedure was used during [[STS-117]] as the S3/S4 truss was being installed.

===Altitude control===
The ISS is [[Orbital station-keeping|maintained at an orbit]] from a minimum altitude limit of 278&nbsp;km (173&nbsp;mi) to a maximum limit of 460&nbsp;km (286&nbsp;mi). The normal maximum limit is 425&nbsp;km (264&nbsp;mi) to allow Soyuz rendezvous missions. Because ISS is constantly losing altitude due to slight [[atmospheric drag]] and [[gravity gradient]] effects, it needs to be boosted to a higher altitude several times each year.<ref name="nasa.gov-iss-environment">{{cite web|url=http://pdlprod3.hosc.msfc.nasa.gov/D-aboutiss/D6.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080213164432/http://pdlprod3.hosc.msfc.nasa.gov/D-aboutiss/D6.html|archivedate=2008-02-13|title=ISS Environment|date=|accessdate=2007-10-15|publisher=[[Johnson Space Center]]}}</ref> These effects vary from day-to-day, however, due to changes in the density of the outer atmosphere due to solar activity.<ref name="iss-height">{{cite web|url=http://www.heavens-above.com/issheight.aspx |title=ISS Height Profile|accessdate=2007-10-15|publisher=Heavens-Above.com}}</ref> The boosting can be performed by two boosters on the [[Zvezda (ISS)|''Zvezda'']] module, a docked Space Shuttle, a [[Progress spacecraft|Progress]] resupply vessel or by ESA's [[Automated Transfer Vehicle|ATV]] and takes approximately two orbits (three hours) in which it is boosted several kilometers higher.<ref name="nasa.gov-iss-environment" />

===Microgravity===
At the station's orbital altitude, the gravity from the Earth is 88% of that at sea level. The state of [[weightlessness]] is due to the constant free fall of the ISS, which according to the [[equivalence principle]], is indiscernible from being in a state of zero gravity. The environment on the station is often described instead as [[Micro-g environment|microgravity]], due to four effects:

*The drag resulting from the residual atmosphere.
*Vibratory acceleration due to mechanical systems and the crew on board the ISS.
*Orbital corrections by the on-board gyroscopes (or thrusters).
*The spatial separation from the real [[centre of mass]] of the ISS - any part of the ISS not at the exact centre of mass will tend to [[Gravity-gradient stabilization|follow its own orbit]]. However, as each point is physically part of the station, this is impossible, and so each component is subject to small accelerations from the forces which keep them attached to the station as it orbits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflight.esa.int/users/downloads/userguides/physenv.pdf|title=European Users Guide to Low Gravity Platforms|accessdate=2006-05-16|format=PDF|publisher=European Space Agency}}</ref>

===Life support===
[[Image:Cycle.gif|thumb|Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS).]]
The ISS [[Environmental Control and Life Support System]] (ECLSS) provides or controls elements such as atmospheric pressure, fire detection and suppression, oxygen levels and water supply. The highest priority for the ECLSS is the ISS atmosphere, but the system also collects, processes, and stores waste and water produced and used by the crew. For example, the system recycles fluid from the sink, shower, urine, and condensation. The [[Elektron (ISS)|''Elektron'']] system aboard ''Zvezda'' and a similar oxygen generation system in ''Destiny'' generate oxygen aboard the station.<ref name="OGS">{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/060215_techwed_iss_oxygen.html|title=Air Apparent: New Oxygen Systems for the ISS|first=Tariq|last=Malik|publisher=Space.com|date=February 15, 2006|accessdate=2008-11-21}}</ref> If required, the crew has a backup option in the form of bottled oxygen and [[chemical oxygen generator|Solid Fuel Oxygen Generation]] (SFOG) canisters.<ref name="breath easy">{{cite web|url=http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2000/ast13nov_1.htm|title=Breathing Easy on the Space Station|first=Patrick L.|last=Barry|date=November 13, 2000|accessdate=2008-11-21}}</ref> Carbon dioxide is removed from the air by the ''[[Vozdukh]]'' system in ''Zvezda'', whilst other waste gases and byproducts of human metabolism are removed by [[Activated carbon|activated charcoal]] filters.<ref name="breath easy" />

The [[atmosphere]] on board the ISS is maintained to have a composition similar to that of the [[Earth's atmosphere]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/space-station2.htm |title=How Space Stations Work|last=Freudenrich, Ph.D., Craig|publisher=Howstuffworks|date=November 20, 2000|accessdate=2008-11-23}}</ref> Normal [[Atmospheric pressure|air pressure]] on the ISS is 101.3&nbsp;[[kilopascal|kPa]] (14.7&nbsp;[[Pounds per square inch|psi]]),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nasaexplores.com/show2_5_8a.php?id=04-032&gl=58 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061114010931/http://www.nasaexplores.com/show2_5_8a.php?id=04-032&gl=58|archivedate=2006-11-14|title=NASAexplores 5-8: The Air Up There|accessdate=2008-10-31}}</ref> the same as at sea level on Earth.

===Sightings===
Due to the size of the International Space Station, about that of an [[American football#Field and players|American football field]], and particularly due to the large reflective area offered by its [[Solar panels on spacecraft|solar panels]], ground based observation of the station is possible with the [[Naked eye#Naked eye in astronomy|naked eye]] if one is within 63 degrees latitude. In many cases the station is one of the brightest naked-eye objects in the sky, though it is only visible for brief periods of time. This is because the station is in low earth orbit, and the sun angle and observer locations need to coincide.<ref name="see">{{Cite web|url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/sightings/index.html|title=International Space Station Sighting Opportunities|accessyear=2007|accessmonthday=November 13|publisher=NASA|year=2007|author=NASA}}</ref>

NASA provides data on forthcoming opportunities for viewing the ISS (and other objects) on the [http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/sightings/index.html Station Sightings] web page, as do the [[European Space Agency]] and the independent site [[Heavens-Above]].<ref name="see" /><ref name="ESAsee">{{Cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaHS/ESA0I6KE43D_iss_0.html|title=See the ISS from your home town|accessyear=2007|accessmonthday=November 13|publisher=European Space Agency|year=2007|author=European Space Agency}}</ref>

==Life on board==
===Expeditions===
{{see also|List of International Space Station Expeditions}}
All permanent station crews are named {{nowrap|"Expedition ''n''"}}, where ''n'' is sequentially increased after each expedition. Expeditions have an average duration of half a year and are often considered synonymous with "Increments." However, "Increments" are distinguished from Expeditions as the program planning period for activities that are to occur during a particular Expedition's residence on ISS. The start of both an Expedition and an Increment is defined by the departure of the previous Expedition crew on a [[Soyuz spacecraft]]. The definition of the Increment is in flux in preparation for 6-person crews that will be broken up into 3-person crews which overlap in their 6-month missions on ISS.

The International Space Station is the [[Space station#List of occupied space stations, with statistics|most-visited spacecraft]] in the history of space flight. {{As of|2008|4|11|df=US}}, it has had 213 (non-distinct) visitors. ''[[Mir]]'' had 137 (non-distinct) visitors.<ref name="SSSM"/> The number of distinct visitors of the ISS is 167.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/10th_anniversary.html|title=Nations Around the World Mark 10th Anniversary of International Space Station|accessyear=2008|accessmonthday=November 23|publisher=NASA|date=November 17, 2008|author=NASA}}</ref> The current expedition to ISS is [[Expedition 18]].<ref name="current">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html|title=International Space Station|accessyear=2008|accessmonthday=October 22|publisher=NASA|year=2008|author=NASA}}</ref>

===Crew schedule===
[[Image:Temporary Sleep Station.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Astronaut [[Peggy Whitson]], in the doorway of a sleeping rack in the ''Destiny'' laboratory]]
The ISS uses [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC, sometimes informally called [[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]]) to regulate its onboard day. The windows are covered at "night" to give the impression of darkness since it experiences 16 sunrises and sunsets a day. During visiting Space Shuttle missions, the ISS crew will mostly follow the shuttle's [[Mission Elapsed Time]] (MET), which is a flexible timezone based solely on the launchtime of the mission.<ref name="MET">{{cite web|url=http://science.nasa.gov/Realtime/Rocket_Sci/clocks/time-met.html|title=Mission Elapsed Time explained|accessdate=2007-11-09|date=September 13, 1995|publisher=NASA}}</ref><ref name="STS-113-interview">{{cite web|url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/feedback/expert/answer/crew/sts-113/index_2.html|title=Ask the STS-113 crew: Question 14|accessdate=2007-11-09|date=December 7, 2002|publisher=NASA}}</ref> Because the sleeping periods between the UTC timezone and the MET usually differ, the ISS crew often has to adjust their sleeping pattern before the Space Shuttle arrives and after it leaves to shift from one timezone to the other, a practise known as ''sleepshifting''.

<!--[[Image:STS-108, Expd. 3 and Expd. 4 dine in Zvezda.jpg|thumb|left|A dinner of the [[STS-108]], Expedition 3 and 4 crews in the ''Zvezda'' module]]-->
A typical day for the crew would begin with a wake-up at 06:00, followed by 'post-sleep' activities and a morning inspection of the station. The crew then breakfasts and takes part in a daily planning conference with Mission Control on the ground, before starting work at around 08:10. The first scheduled exercise of the day follows, after which the crew continues work until 13:05. Following a one-hour lunch break, the afternoon consists of more exercise and work, before the crew carries out its 'presleep' activities, beginning at 19:30, including dinner and a crew conference. The scheduled sleep period begins at 21:30, at which point the daily schedule is complete. In general, the crew works 10 hours per day on a weekday, and 5 hours on Saturdays, with the rest of the time being their own, for relaxation, games or work catch-up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/287386main_110508_tl.pdf|title=ISS Crew Timeline|date=November 5, 2008|accessdate=2008-11-05|publisher=NASA|format=PDF}}</ref>

==Scientific research==
One of the main goals of the ISS is to provide a place to conduct experiments that require one or more of the unusual conditions present on the station. The main fields of research include [[biology]] (including [[biomedical research]] and [[biotechnology]]), [[physics]] (including [[fluid physics]], [[materials science]], and [[quantum physics]]), [[astronomy]] (including [[cosmology]]), and [[meteorology]].<ref name="NASA Fields of Research">{{cite web | url = http://pdlprod3.hosc.msfc.nasa.gov/A-fieldsresearch/index.html | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080123150641/http://pdlprod3.hosc.msfc.nasa.gov/A-fieldsresearch/index.html | archivedate=2008-01-23 | title = Fields of Research | date = June 26, 2007 | publisher = NASA}}</ref><ref name="NASA ISS Goals">{{cite web | url = http://pdlprod3.hosc.msfc.nasa.gov/B-gettingonboard/index.html | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071208091537/http://pdlprod3.hosc.msfc.nasa.gov/B-gettingonboard/index.html | archivedate=2007-12-08 | title = Getting on Board | date = June 26, 2007 | publisher = NASA}}</ref> The [[Vision for Space Exploration|2005 NASA Authorization Act]] designated the U.S segment of the International Space Station as a national laboratory with a goal to increase the utilisation of the ISS by other Federal entities and the private sector. {{As of|2007}}, little experimentation other than the study of the long-term effects of microgravity on humans has taken place. With four new research modules set to arrive at the ISS by 2011, however, more specialized research is expected to begin.

===Scientific ISS modules===
[[Image:Helms.window.jpg|thumb|[[Susan J. Helms]], Expedition Two flight engineer, looks through the nadir window in the [[Destiny (ISS module)|''Destiny'' laboratory]].]]
The [[Destiny Laboratory Module|''Destiny'' laboratory]] is the main research facility currently aboard the ISS. Produced by NASA and launched in February 2001, it is a research facility for general experiments, providing space for 24 [[International Standard Payload Rack]]s, some of which are used for environmental systems and living equipment. ''Destiny'' also features a 20&nbsp;inch, optically perfect window, the largest such window ever produced for use in space.<ref>{{cite book |title=Too Far from Home|last=Jones|first=Chris|year=2008|publisher=Vintage|isbn=978-0099513247|url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/Too-Far-Home-Chris-Jones/dp/0099513242/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qisbn=1225744747&sr=8-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/destiny.html | title = NASA - U.S. Destiny Laboratory | date = March 26, 2007 | accessdate = 2007-06-26 | publisher = NASA}}</ref>

The [[Columbus (ISS module)|''Columbus'' module]] is another research facility, designed and built by the [[European Space Agency]]. Launched in February 2008, it provides a [[European Drawer Rack|generic laboratory]] as well as facilities specifically designed for [[Biolab|biology]], [[European Physiology Modules|biomedical research]] and [[Fluid Science Laboratory|fluid physics]]. The laboratory also provides external mounting locations for experiments such as the [[European Technology Exposure Facility]], [[Solar Monitoring Observatory]],[[Materials International Space Station Experiment]] and [[Atomic Clock Ensemble in Space]]. A number of expansions are planned to study [[quantum physics]] and [[cosmology]].

The [[Japanese Experiment Module]], also known as ''Kibō'', was put in service during [[STS-124]] on June 3, 2008. It was developed by [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency|JAXA]] to function as an observatory and to gather astronomical data. The module also provides an external platform, the Exposed Facility, that allows payloads to be directly exposed to the harsh space environment, and which is serviced by the module's own robotic arm, the JEM-RMS.

The station is also planned to carry a particle physics experiment, called the [[Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer]] (AMS), which will be launched on [[STS-134]] and mounted externally on the Integrated Truss Structure. The AMS will search for various types of unusual matter by measuring cosmic rays, and its experiments will help researchers study the formation of the universe and search for evidence of dark matter and antimatter.

The [[ExPRESS Logistics Carrier]]s, developed by NASA, are set to be launched for the ISS beginning with [[STS-129]], which is expected to take place no earlier than September 11, 2009.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sworld.com.au/steven/space/shuttle/manifest.txt | title = Unofficial Space Shuttle Manifest | accessdate = 2007-06-26 | date = June 25, 2007 | publisher = Small World Communications|first=Steven S.|last=Pietrobon}}</ref> They will allow experiments to be deployed and conducted in the vacuum of space and will provide the necessary electricity and computing to locally process data from experiments. Finally, the [[Multipurpose Laboratory Module]], created by the [[Russian Federal Space Agency|RKA]], is expected to launch for the ISS in December 2011, and will be the primary Russian laboratory on the station.<ref name="Manifest">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/iss_manifest.html|title=Consolidated Launch Manifest|accessyear=2008|accessmonthday=July 8|publisher=NASA|author=NASA|year=2008}}</ref> It will supply the proper resources for general microgravity experiments.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.khrunichev.ru/khrunichev_eng/live/full_mks.asp?id=13190 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927002737/http://www.khrunichev.ru/khrunichev_eng/live/full_mks.asp?id=13190 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |title=Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Centre - FGB-based Multipurpose Lab Module (MLM) |accessdate=2008-10-31 }}</ref>

Several planned research modules have been cancelled, including the [[Centrifuge Accommodations Module]] (used to produce varying levels of [[artificial gravity]]) and two [[Russian Research Module]]s (used for general experimentation).

===Areas of research===
[[Image:Space Fire.jpg|thumb|right|A comparison between fire on Earth (left) and fire in a microgravity environment, such as that found on the ISS (right).]]
<!-- http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/science/index.html and http://www.scipoc.msfc.nasa.gov/factchron2.html have more specific data on experiments that could be added here or on another page dedicated to the different experiments done. -->
There are a number of plans to study biology on the ISS. One goal is to improve understanding of the effect of long-term space exposure on the human body. Subjects such as [[muscle atrophy]], [[Osteoporosis|bone loss]], and fluid shifts are studied with the intention to use this data so [[space colonization]] and lengthy [[Human spaceflight|space travel]] can become feasible (at present levels of bone loss and muscular atrophy, there would be a significant risk of fractures and movement problems if astronauts landed on an extraterrestrial planet following a lengthy space cruise<ref>{{cite book|last=Buckey|first=Jay|title=Space Physiology|publisher=OUP USA|date=February 23, 2006|url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/Space-Physiology-Jay-C-Buckey/dp/0195137256/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qisbn=1227468809&sr=8-1|isbn=978-0195137255}}</ref>). The effect of near-weightlessness on [[evolution]], development and growth, and the internal processes of plants and animals are also studied. In response to recent data suggesting that microgravity enables the growth of three-dimensional human body-like tissues and that unusual protein crystals can be formed in space, NASA has indicated a desire to investigate these phenomena.<ref name="NASA Fields of Research" />

Prominent physics problems are also studied - the physics of fluids in microgravity are not completely understood, and researchers would like to be able to accurately model fluids in the future. Additionally, since fluids in space can be combined nearly completely regardless of their relative weights, there is some interest in investigating the combination of fluids that would not mix well on Earth. By examining reactions that are slowed down by low gravity and temperatures, scientists also hope to gain new insight concerning [[state of matter|states of matter]] (specifically in regards to [[superconductivity]]).<ref name="NASA Fields of Research" />

Additionally, researchers hope to examine [[combustion]] in the presence of less gravity than on Earth. Any findings involving the efficiency of the burning or the creation of byproducts could improve the process of energy production, which would be of economic and environmental interest. Scientists plan to use the ISS to examine [[aerosol]]s, [[ozone]], [[water vapor]], and [[oxide]]s in Earth's atmosphere as well as [[cosmic ray]]s, [[cosmic dust]], [[antimatter]], and [[dark matter]] in the [[Universe]].<ref name="NASA Fields of Research" />

The long-term goals of this research are to develop the technology necessary for human-based space and planetary exploration and colonization (including [[life support system]]s, safety precautions, environmental monitoring in space), new ways to treat diseases, more efficient methods of producing materials, more accurate measurements than would be possible to achieve on Earth, and a more complete understanding of the Universe.<ref name="NASA Fields of Research" /><ref name="NASA ISS Goals" />

==Political and financial aspects==
{{main|Political and financial aspects of the ISS}}

As a multinational collaborative project, the legal and financial aspects of the ISS are detailed and complex — governing ownership of modules, crewing and utilisation of the station, and responsibilities for station resupply.

The main legal document establishing obligations and rights between the ISS partners is the Space Station Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA), an international treaty signed on January 28, 1998, by fifteen governments involved in the Space Station project. This set the stage for a second layer of agreements, called Memoranda of Understanding (MOU), between NASA and Roskosmos, ESA, CSA and JAXA. These MOUs are then further split, for instance into contractual obligations between nations and trading of partners rights and obligations. Use of the Russian Orbital segment is also negotiated at this level, whereas the other sections of the station have been agreed to be assigned as follows:

# [[Columbus (ISS module)|''Columbus'']]: 51% for ESA, 49% for NASA and [[Canadian Space Agency|CSA]] (CSA has agreed with NASA to use 2.3% of all non-Russian ISS structure) 
# [[Japanese Experiment Module|''Kibo'']]: 51% for [[JAXA]], 49% for NASA and CSA (2.3%)
# [[Destiny (ISS module)|''Destiny'']]: 100% for NASA and CSA (2.3%) as well as 100% of the truss payload accommodation
# Crew time and power from the solar panel structure, as well as rights to purchase supporting services (upload/download and communication services) 76.6% for NASA, 12.8% for JAXA, 8.3% for ESA and 2.3% for CSA

The most cited figure of an estimate of overall costs of the ISS ranges from 35 billion to 100 billion [[United States dollar|USD]].<ref name="cost2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14505278/|title=What's the cost of the space station?|accessyear=2008|accessmonthday=September 30|publisher=MSNBC|date=August 25, 2006|first=Alan|last=Boyle}}</ref> ESA, the only agency actually stating potential overall costs, estimates [[Euro|€]]100 billion for the entire station over at least a ten year period.<ref name = "costs">{{cite web | url = http://www.esa.int/esaHS/ESAQHA0VMOC_iss_0.html | title = How Much Does It Cost? | publisher = European Space Agency | date=August 9, 2005 |accessdate = 2008-03-27}}</ref> Giving a precise cost estimate for the ISS is not straightforward, as it is difficult to determine which costs should actually be contributed to the ISS program, or how the Russian contribution should be measured.
<!-- Need to insert a summary paragraph on criticism here. The financial summary could also do with being looked at. -->

===Future of the ISS===
[[NASA Administrator]] [[Michael D. Griffin]] says the International Space Station has a role to play as NASA moves forward with a new focus for the manned space program, which is to go out beyond Earth orbit for purposes of human exploration and scientific discovery. "The International Space Station is now a stepping stone on the way, rather than being the end of the line." stated Griffin.<ref name="Explore">{{cite web |url= http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/exploration/main/griffin_why_explore.html|title= Why Explore Space?|accessdate=2008-07-31 |last= Griffin |first=Michael|date=July 18, 2001|publisher=NASA}}</ref> Griffin has said that station crews will not only continue to learn how to live and work in space, but also will learn how to build hardware that can survive and function for the years required to make the round-trip voyage from Earth to Mars.<ref name="Explore" />

Despite this view, however, in an internal e-mail leaked to the press on August 18, 2008, from Griffin to NASA managers,<ref name="leak">{{Cite web|url=http://www.space.com/news/080907-nasa-griffin-email.html|title=NASA Chief Vents Frustration in Leaked E-mail |accessyear=2008|accessmonthday=November 6|publisher=Space.com|year=2008|first=Tariq|last=Malik}}</ref><ref name="leak3">{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=29133|title=Internal NASA email from NASA Administrator Griffin|accessdate=2008-11-03|publisher=SpaceRef.com|author=Orlando Sentinel|date=July 7, 2008}}</ref><ref name="emailimage">{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/news_space_thewritestuff/files/GriffinEmail.jpg|title=Michael Griffin email image|accessyear=2008|accessmonthday=November 6|publisher=Orlando Sentinel|year=2008|first=Michael|last=Griffin|format=jpg}}</ref> Griffin apparently communicated his belief that the current US administration had made no viable plan for US crews to participate in the ISS beyond 2011, and that the [[Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB) and [[Office of Science and Technology Policy]] (OSTP) were actually seeking its demise.<ref name="leak3" /> The email appeared to suggest that Griffin believed the only reasonable solution was to extend the operation of the [[Space Shuttle]] beyond 2010, but noted that Executive Policy (i.e., the [[White House]]) was firm that there will be no extension of the Space Shuttle retirement date, and thus no US capability to launch crews into orbit until the [[Ares I]]/[[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion]] system becomes operational in 2014, at the earliest.<ref name="leak3" /> He did not see purchase of Russian launches for NASA crews as politically viable following the [[2008 South Ossetia war]], and hoped the incoming US administration would resolve the issue in 2009 by extending Space Shuttle operations beyond 2010.

On September 7, 2008, NASA released a statement regarding the leaked email, in which Griffin said: {{Quote|"The leaked internal email fails to provide the contextual framework for my remarks, and my support for the administration's policies. Administration policy is to retire the Space Shuttle in 2010 and purchase crew transport from Russia until Ares and Orion are available. The administration continues to support our request for an INKSNA exemption. Administration policy continues to be that we will take no action to preclude continued operation of the International Space Station past 2016. I strongly support these administration policies, as do [[Office of Science and Technology Policy|OSTP]] and [[Office of Management and Budget|OMB]]."|Michael D.

==Station operations==

===Space tourism===
[[Image:YuriMalenchenko.jpg|thumb|[[Yuri Malenchenko]] was the first person to be married in space.]]
{{As of|2008}} there have been six [[Space tourism#List of flown space tourists|space tourists]] to the ISS, each paying around US $25 million; the tourists, or ''[[Spaceflight participant]]s'', were launched and returned via Russian crew rotation missions on [[Soyuz spacecraft]]. In addition, the ISS was the location for the first 'space wedding', during which Russian cosmonaut [[Yuri Malenchenko]], flying [[Expedition 7]], married Ekaterina Dmitrieva, who was in Texas at the time.

===ISS golf event===
''[[Expedition 14#EVA 1|Golf Shot Around The World]]'' was an event in which, on an [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]] during [[Expedition 14]], a special golf ball, equipped with a tracking device, was hit from the station and sent into its own [[low Earth orbit]] for a fee paid by a Canadian golf equipment manufacturer to the Russian Space Agency.<ref name="golf">{{Cite web|url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewnews.html?id=1093|title=Golf or Science: What is NASA's Plan for the Space Station?|accessyear=2007|accessmonthday=November 13|publisher=SpaceRef.com|date=February 28, 2006|first=Keith|last=Cowing}}</ref>

===Paper aeroplane launch===
{{see also|Origami airplane launched from space}}
Japanese scientists and [[origami]] masters propose to launch a [[flotilla]] of [[paper plane]]s from the ISS in early 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airspacemag.com/space-exploration/The_Ultimate_Paper_Airplane.html|title=The Ultimate Paper Airplane|work=Air & Space Magazine|publisher=Air & Space Magazine — Smithsonian|first=Ichiko|last=Fuyuno|date=May 30, 2008|accessdate=2008-11-05}}</ref> Around 30 planes will make the descent, each gliding downward over what is expected to be the course of several months. If one of the planes survives to Earth, it will have made the longest flight ever by a paper plane, traversing some 400&nbsp;km (250&nbsp;mi), and will have demonstrated the feasibility of slow-speed, low-friction [[atmospheric reentry]]. A prototype of the origami aeroplane passed a durability test in a wind tunnel in March 2008, and [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency|Japan's space agency]] adopted it for feasibility studies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2008/03/27/origami-space-plane.html |title=Origami Plane to Be Launched From Space |accessdate=2008-08-05 |first=Mari|last=Yamaguchi |date=March 27, 2008|publisher=Associated Press trough Discovery News}}</ref>

===Major incidents===
====2003 &ndash; ''Columbia'' disaster====
The [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'' disaster]] on February 1, 2003, resulted in a two-and-a-half-year suspension of the US [[Space Shuttle program]]. Another one-year suspension following [[STS-114]] due to continued foam shedding on the [[Space Shuttle external tank|external tank]] resulted in some uncertainty about the future of the International Space Station. All crew exchanges between February 2003 and July 2006 were carried out solely using the Russian [[Soyuz spacecraft]] (STS-114 in July 2005 was a logistics-only visit). Starting with [[Expedition 7]], two-astronaut caretaker crews were launched in contrast to the previously launched crews of three. Because the ISS had not been visited by a Space Shuttle for over three years, a larger than planned amount of waste had accumulated, temporarily hindering station operations in 2004, but automated [[Progress spacecraft|Progress]] transports and the [[STS-114]] mission were able to eliminate this waste build-up.

====2006 &ndash; Smoke problem====
On September 18, 2006, the [[Expedition 13]] crew activated a smoke alarm in the Russian segment of the International Space Station when fumes from one of the three oxygen generators triggered momentary fear about a possible fire. The crew initially reported smoke in the cabin, as well as a smell. The alarm was later found to be caused by a leak of potassium hydroxide from an oxygen vent, and the associated equipment was turned off, with officials saying that there was no fire and the crew was not in any danger.   

The station's ventilation system was shut down to prevent the spread of smoke or contaminants through the rest of the complex. A charcoal air filter was put in place to help scrub the atmosphere of any lingering potassium hydroxide fumes. The space station's program manager said the crew never donned gas masks, but as a precaution put on surgical gloves and masks to prevent contact with any contaminants.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://spaceflightnow.com/station/exp13/060918elektron.html| title = Oxygen Generator Problem Triggers Station Alarm | publisher = CBS News through Spaceflight Now|date=September 18, 2006|first=William|last=Harwood|accessdate=2008-11-24}}</ref>

On November 2, 2006, the payload brought by the Russian [[Progress spacecraft|Progress]] M-58 allowed the crew to repair the Elektron using spare parts.<ref>

====2007 &ndash; Computer failure====
On June 14, 2007, during [[Expedition 15]] and flight day 7 of [[STS-117]]'s visit to ISS, a computer malfunction on the Russian segments at 06:30 UTC left the station without thrusters, oxygen generation, carbon dioxide scrubber, and other environmental control systems, causing the temperature on the station to rise. A successful restart of the computers resulted in a false fire alarm that woke the crew at 11:43 UTC.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts117/news/STS-117-12.html| title = STS-117 MCC Status Report #12 | publisher = NASA|author=Mission Control Center|date=June 14, 2007|accessdate=2008-11-24}}</ref><ref name="space.com 070616">{{Cite web|url=http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/070616_iss_computer_prog.html|title=More Progress Made to Recover Space Station Computers |accessyear=2007|accessmonthday=November 13|publisher=Space.com|date=June 16, 2007|first=Tariq|last=Malik}}</ref>

By June 15, the primary Russian computers were back online, and communicating with the US side of the station by bypassing a circuit, but secondary systems remained offline.<ref name="MCCSR15">{{cite web | url = http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts117/news/STS-117-15.html| title = STS-117 MCC Status Report #15 | publisher = NASA|author=Mission Control Center|date=June 15, 2007|accessdate=2008-11-24}}</ref> NASA reported that without the computer that controls the oxygen levels, the station had 56 days of oxygen available.<ref name="wikinews computer failure">{{Cite web|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/general/967210/atlantis_return_may_be_delayed/index.html|title=Atlantis' Return May Be Delayed|accessyear=2007|accessmonthday=November 13|publisher=Associated Press|date=June 14, 2007|last=Lozano|first=Juan A.}}</ref>

By the afternoon of June 16, ISS Program Manager Michael Suffredini confirmed that all six computers governing command and navigation systems for Russian segments of the station, including two thought to have failed, were back online, and would be tested over several days. The cooling system was the first system brought back online. Troubleshooting of the failure by the ISS crew found that the root cause was condensation inside the electrical connectors, leading to a short-circuit that triggered the "power off" command line leading to all three of the redundant processing units.<ref name="oberg">{{Cite web|url=http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/print/5598|title=Space Station: Internal NASA Reports Explain Origins of June Computer Crisis|accessyear=2007|accessmonthday=November 13|publisher=IEEE Spectrum|date=October 4, 2007|first=James|last=Oberg}}</ref> This was initially a concern, because the [[European Space Agency]] uses the same computer systems, supplied by EADS [[Astrium Space Transportation]], for the [[Columbus (ISS module)|''Columbus'' laboratory module]] and the [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]].<ref name="ISS computer woes concern Europe">{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6763173.stm|title=ISS computer woes concern Europe|accessyear=2007|accessmonthday=November 13|publisher=BBC News|date=June 18, 2007|first=Irene|last=Klotz}}</ref> Once the root cause was understood, plans were implemented to avoid the problem in the future.

====2007 &ndash; Torn solar panel====
[[Image:STS120SolarPanel.jpg|thumb|Damage to the 4B wing of the P6 solar array found when it was redeployed after being moved to its final position on [[STS-120]].]]
On October 30, 2007, during [[Expedition 16]] and flight day 7 of [[STS-120]]'s visit to ISS, following the reposition of the P6 truss segment, ISS and {{OV|103}} crew members began the deployment of the two solar arrays on the truss. The first array deployed without incident, and the second array deployed about 80% before astronauts noticed a 76-centimetre (2.5&nbsp;ft) tear. The arrays had been deployed in earlier phases of the space station's construction, and the retraction necessary to move the truss to its final position had gone less smoothly than planned.<ref name="Astronauts notice tear in solar panel">{{Cite web |url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/space/1123767/astronauts_notice_tear_in_solar_panel/index.html |title=Astronauts notice tear in solar panel|accessyear=2007|accessmonthday=October 30|publisher=Associated Press|date=October 30, 2007|first=Liz|last=Austin Peterson}}</ref>

A second, smaller tear was noticed upon further inspection, and the mission's spacewalks were completely replanned in mere days to devise a repair — normally such spacewalks take several months to plan and are settled upon well in advance. On November 3, spacewalker [[Scott Parazynski]] assisted by [[Douglas Wheelock]] fixed the torn panels using makeshift "cufflinks" and riding on the end of the Space Shuttle's [[Orbiter Boom Sensor System|OBSS]] inspection arm; the first ever spacewalker to do so. The spacewalk was regarded as significantly more dangerous than most due to the possibility of shock from the electricity generating solar arrays, the unprecedented usage of the OBSS, and the lack of spacewalk planning and training for the impromptu procedure. Parazynski was, however, able to repair the damage as planned and the repaired array was fully deployed.<ref name="Space Station's Damaged Panel Is Fixed">{{Cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/03/AR2007110300227.html|title=Space Station's Damaged Panel Is Fixed|accessyear=2007|accessmonthday=November 3|publisher=The Washington Post|date=November 4, 2007|first=Rob|last=Stein}}</ref>

====2007 &ndash; Damaged starboard Solar Alpha Rotary Joint====
During [[STS-120]], a problem was detected in the starboard Solar Alpha Rotary Joint (SARJ). This joint, together with a similar device on the port side of the station's truss structure, rotates the large solar arrays to keep them facing the Sun. Excessive vibration and high current spikes in the array drive motor were noted, resulting in a decision to substantially curtail motion of the starboard SARJ until the cause was understood. Inspections during EVAs on [[STS-120]] and [[STS-123]] showed extensive contamination from metallic shavings and debris in the large drive gear, and confirmed damage to the large metallic race ring at the heart of the joint.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts123/080325sarj/index.html|title=Station chief gives detailed update on joint problem|accessdate=2008-11-05|last=Harwood|first=William|publisher=CBS News and SpaceflightNow.com|date=March 25, 2008}}</ref> The joint is currently locked in place, the station having sufficient operating power to carry out its near-term science program with only modest impacts on operations.

On September 25, 2008, NASA announced significant progress in diagnosing the source of the starboard SARJ problem, and a programme to repair it on orbit, beginning with the flight of the {{OV|105}} on the current [[STS-126]] mission, which launched on November 15, 2008.<ref name="Manifest" /> STS-126 is a 16-day mission with four EVAs, largely dedicated to servicing and repair of the Solar Alpha Rotary Joints, plus station logistics and resupply. The crew carried out servicing of both the starboard and port SARJs, lubricating both joints and replacing 11 of 12 Trundle Bearings on the starboard SARJ.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts126/126_overview.html|title=Crew Expansion Prep, SARJ Repair Focus of STS-126|accessdate=2008-11-05|publisher=NASA|date=October 30, 2008}}</ref><ref name="sts-126 eva1">{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts126/081118fd5/index.html|title=Astronauts prepare for first spacewalk of shuttle flight|date=November 18, 2008|first=William|last=Harwood|publisher=CBS News & SpaceflightNow.com|accessdate=2008-11-22}}</ref> It is hoped that this servicing will provide a temporary solution to the problem, with the joint being tested on Flight Day 12 to determine success of the operation before ''Endeavour'' leaves the station, however detailed analysis of the success of the repair will not be available for several months. The long-term solution planned by NASA is a 10-EVA plan called 'SARJ-XL', which calls for the installation of structural supports between the two segments of the SARJ, and a new race ring to then be inserted between them, to completely replace the failed joint.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2008/08/maf-complete-et-129-ahead-of-schedule-sarj-xls-10-eva-plan/|title=MAF complete ET-129 ahead of schedule - SARJ XL’s 10 EVA plan|accessdate=2008-11-23|publisher=NASASpaceflight.com|date=August 6, 2008|first=Chris|last=Bergin}}</ref>
