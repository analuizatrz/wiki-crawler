'''Cillian Murphy''' ([[Irish Language|Irish]]: Cillian Ó Murchú, [[May 25]], [[1976]]) is an [[Ireland|Irish]] [[actor]] known for his distinctively blue eyes[http://movies.about.com/b/a/193285.htm] and rising star status. ''Cillian'' is an Irish name which is [[anglicised]] ''Killian''; both spellings are [[IPA chart for English|pronounced]] {{IPA|/ˈkɪliːən/}}.
==Early life==
Murphy was born in [[Douglas, Cork]] in [[Ireland]]. He attended the [[Presentation Brothers College, Cork]], where one of his teachers was the writer [[William Wall]], and later studied [[law]] at  [[University College Cork]] (UCC). 
Initially his interest in performing was led by music. He played guitar with a [[Frank Zappa]] influenced band called ''Sons of Mr. Greengenes''. However, by the time he left college his primary interest was acting. 
His first major role was in the UCC Drama Society production of ''[[Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme]]''. He went on to appear on the professional stage in ''[[Disco Pigs]]'', directed by Pat Kiernan and written by Enda Walsh. 

After touring with ''Disco Pigs'' in [[London]], [[Edinburgh]] and [[Cork (city)|Cork]], he left UCC without graduating.

==Career==
[[Image:Cillian1.jpg|110px|right|thumb|[[Cillian Murphy]] as Jim from ''28 Days Later''.]]''Disco Pigs'' was Murphy's first big break. He was cast in the central role of Pig in Corcadorca's 1996 production of Enda Walsh's original play. He later reprised that role for the [[2001 in film|2001]] feature film version by Kirsten Sheridan. Also, he wrote and sang the song ''So New'' for the soundtrack. He was also well-known from his role in ''[[Intermission (film)|Intermission]]''.
However, it was not until [[Danny Boyle]]'s ''[[28 Days Later]]'' became a [[sleeper hit]] in the [[United States of America|USA]] in 2003, that the bigger studios and directors started to take notice. As for the actor's full-frontal nudity in the film, Murphy claimed he was perfectly comfortable doing nudity if the role called for it.

In recent years he has had smaller parts in such Hollywood films as ''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring (film)|Girl with a Pearl Earring]]'' and ''[[Cold Mountain (film)|Cold Mountain]]''. [[2005 in film|2005]] was the year that brought Murphy into more renown with his acclaimed performance as Dr. Jonathan Crane (also known as [[Scarecrow (comics)|The Scarecrow]]) in ''[[Batman Begins]]'' and his role as Jackson Rippner in ''[[Red Eye (film)|Red Eye]]''. Murphy received a nomination for the Best Villain honor at the  [[MTV Movie Awards 2006|2006 MTV Movie Awards]] for his performance in ''Batman Begins'', but lost to [[Hayden Christensen]] for ''[[Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith]]''.  

He originally auditioned for the role of [[Batman]] (Bruce Wayne) in ''Batman Begins''. Though the part was eventually given to [[Christian Bale]], director [[Christopher Nolan]] was reportedly very impressed with Murphy's audition and persuaded him to take on the role of Crane. It is not known if the character of Dr. Crane will appear in the upcoming sequel, though Murphy has stated that he would be glad to reprise the role if asked.

In 2005 he starred in the movie ''[[Breakfast on Pluto]]'', based on the novel of the same title by [[Patrick McCabe]]. Additionally, he was nominated for a [[Golden Globe]] for Best Actor in Musical or Comedy for this movie, though he lost to [[Joaquin Phoenix]] for his role in ''[[Walk the Line]]''. He also starred as Damien in [[Ken Loach]]'s film ''[[The Wind That Shakes the Barley]]'', which won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]].

==Personal life== 
Murphy married his long term girlfriend Yvonne McGuinness (b. 1972), in August 2004 in [[Provence]], [[France]]. The couple lives in [[London]], [[England]], with their son Malachy  (b. December 2005). 

According to ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' magazine, he was #3 of "The Most Valuable Players of Summer 2005", a list for entertainers who have outstanding breakthrough performances for the year 2005. He was placed behind [[Terrence Howard]] and [[Matt Dillon]]. The magazine went on to compare him with [[Robert Mitchum]].
