The '''Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Church of America''' (1890) was one of the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church bodies that merged into the [[Lutheran Church in America]] (LCA) in 1962. It was defined more by its [[Ethnic Finn|Finnish]] ethnic origin than by any specific theological strain. In 1962, the FELC had 25000 members in 79 congregations, and was the smallest of LCA's founding church bodies. The LCA was party to the merger that created the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] in 1988.
