'''William Maldon "Bill" Woodfull''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] ([[22 August]] [[1897]], [[Maldon, Victoria]], [[Australia]] - [[11 August]] [[1965]], [[Tweed Heads]], [[New South Wales]]) was an Australian [[cricket]] player. He played for Victoria and the [[Australian cricket team]], and captained both.

Woodfull attended [[Melbourne High School (Victoria)|Melbourne High School]]. A solid opening [[batsman]], Woodfull made his [[first-class cricket]] debut for Victoria in the [[1921]]-22 season. He later toured [[England]] in [[1926]], making his [[Test cricket]] debut in the first Test. He formed a strong opening pair with [[Bill Ponsford]] in an era when Australia fielded a formidable team, and earned the nickname ''The Rock'' for his immaculate defensive technique and supremely patient personality.

For the next tour of England in [[1930]], Woodfull was appointed captain, and led Australia until his retirement 25 Tests later in [[1934]].

He led Australia during the notorious [[Bodyline]] series in [[1932]]-33, when the touring [[English cricket team]], led by [[Douglas Jardine]], used the tactic of bowling at the bodies of the Australian batsmen. Despite numerous injuries to himself and his players, he remained publicly calm and patient throughout this tumultuous series, only expressing his true disgust in private. One remark, to English team manager [[Pelham Warner]] as he visited the Australian dressing room to express sympathies for a nasty wound to Woodfull caused by the Bodyline bowling, was leaked to the press and became one of the most famous quotations to emerge from this momentous period of cricket history:

:''I don't want to see you, Mr Warner. There are two teams out there. One is trying to play cricket and the other is not.''

After the Bodyline series, Woodfull led Australia to England in the reconciliatory tour of [[1934]], after which he retired from first-class cricket.

He was named a [[Wisden Cricketer of the Year]] for [[1927]], and inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in [[2001]].

Outside cricket, Woodfull made a successful career as a mathematics teacher and served as headmaster of his ''[[alma mater]]'' Melbourne High School. He always considered his contributions to education more important than anything he ever did on the cricket field. One of his pupils was [[Keith Miller]], and the school oval was later named the Miller-Woodfull Oval.

In [[1934]] he turned down the offer of a [[knighthood]] for services to cricket, but in [[1963]] accepted an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] for services to education.

Woodfull played 35 Tests for Australia, scoring 2,300 runs at an average of 46.00. In his first-class career, he played 174 matches, scoring 13,388 runs at an average of 64.99.
