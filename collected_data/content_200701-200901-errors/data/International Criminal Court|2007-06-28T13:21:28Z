[[Image:International Criminal Court logo.svg|thumb|The official logo of the ICC]]
The '''International Criminal Court''' ('''ICC''') was established in 2002 as a permanent tribunal to prosecute individuals for [[genocide]], [[crimes against humanity]], [[war crimes]], and the [[crime of aggression]], although it cannot currently exercise jurisdiction over the crime of aggression.  The court can only prosecute crimes committed on or after [[July 1]] [[2002]], the date its founding treaty, the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]], entered into force.

As of June 2007, 104 states are [[States Parties to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|members of the Court]], and a further 41 countries have signed but not [[ratification|ratified]] the Rome Statute. However, a number of states, including [[China]], [[India]] and the [[United States]], are critical of the Court and have not joined.

The Court can generally only exercise jurisdiction in cases where the accused is a national of a state party, the alleged crime took place on the territory of a state party, or a situation is referred to the Court by the [[United Nations Security Council]].  The Court is designed to complement existing national judicial systems: it can only exercise its jurisdiction when national courts are unwilling or unable to investigate or prosecute such crimes.  Primary responsibility to exercise jurisdiction over suspected criminals is therefore left to individual states.

The official seat of the ICC is in [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]], but its proceedings may take place anywhere.  The Court is separate from, and should not be confused with, the [[International Court of Justice]] (often referred to as the “World Court”), which is the [[United Nations]] organ that settles disputes between nations.

"International Criminal Court" is sometimes abbreviated as ICCt to distinguish it from [[ICC|several other organizations abbreviated as ICC]]. However, the more common abbreviation "ICC" is used in this article.

==History==
===Early development===
In 1948, following the [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg]] and [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East|Tokyo Tribunals]], the [[United Nations General Assembly]] recognised the need for a permanent international court to deal with atrocities of the kind committed during [[World War II]].<ref name=iccfact/>  At the request of the General Assembly, the [[International Law Commission]] drafted two draft statutes by the early 1950s but these were shelved as the [[Cold War]] made the establishment of an international criminal court politically unrealistic.<ref name="Cato">Gary T.

===Adoption and entry into force of the Rome Statute===
Following years of negotiations, the General Assembly convened a conference in [[Rome|Rome, Italy]], in June 1998, with the aim of finalising a treaty.  On [[July 17]] [[1998]], the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] was adopted by a vote of 120 to 7, with 21 countries abstaining.  The seven countries that voted against the treaty were [[Iraq]], [[Israel]], [[Libya]], the [[People's Republic of China]], [[Qatar]], the [[United States]], and [[Yemen]].<ref>Michael P.

==Jurisdiction==
===Crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court===
Article 5 of the Rome Statute grants the Court jurisdiction over four groups of crimes, which it refers to as the “''most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole''”: the crime of [[genocide]], [[crimes against humanity]], [[war crimes]], and the [[crime of aggression]].  The statute defines each of these crimes except for aggression: it provides that the Court will not exercise its jurisdiction over the crime of aggression until such time as the states parties agree on a definition of the crime and set out the conditions under which it may be prosecuted.<ref>[http://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/2.htm Article 5] of the Rome Statute. Accessed 2006-11-23.</ref>

Many states wanted to add [[terrorism]] and [[Illegal drug trade|drug trafficking]] to the list of crimes covered by the Rome Statute; however, the states were unable to agree on a definition for terrorism and it was decided not to include drug trafficking as this might overwhelm the Court's limited resources.<ref name=iccfact>United Nations Department of Public Information, December 2002. [http://www.un.org/News/facts/iccfact.htm ''The International Criminal Court''].

===Territorial jurisdiction===
During the negotiations that led to the Rome Statute, a large number of states argued that the Court should be allowed to exercise [[universal jurisdiction]].  However, this proposal was defeated due in large part to opposition from the United States.<ref>Elizabeth Wilmhurst, 1999. ‘Jurisdiction of the Court’, p. 136.  In Roy S Lee (ed.), ''The International Criminal Court: The Making of the Rome Statute''.  The Hague: Kluwer Law International. ISBN 90-411-1212-X.</ref>  A compromise was reached, allowing the Court to exercise jurisdiction only under certain limited circumstances, namely:

#Where the person accused of committing a crime is a national of a state party (or where the person's state has accepted the jurisdiction of the Court);  or
#Where the alleged crime was committed on the territory of a state party (or where the state on whose territory the crime was committed has accepted the jurisdiction of the Court); or
#Where a situation is referred to the Court by the UN Security Council.<ref>[http://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/2.htm Articles 12 & 13] of the Rome Statute. Accessed 2006-11-23.</ref>

===Temporal jurisdiction===
The Court's jurisdiction does not apply retroactively: it can only prosecute crimes committed on or after 1 July 2002  (the date on which the Rome Statute entered into force).  Where a state becomes party to the Rome Statute after that date, the Court can exercise jurisdiction automatically with respect to crimes committed after the statute enters into force for that state.<ref name=article11>[http://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/2.htm Article 11] of the Rome Statute. Accessed 2006-11-23.</ref>

===Complementarity===
The Court is intended as a court of last resort, investigating and prosecuting only where national courts have failed.  Article 17 of the Statute provides that a case is inadmissible if:

:‘(a)     The case is being investigated or prosecuted by a State which has jurisdiction over it, unless the State is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution;

:(b)     The case has been investigated by a State which has jurisdiction over it and the State has decided not to prosecute the person concerned, unless the decision resulted from the unwillingness or inability of the State genuinely to prosecute;

:(c)     The person concerned has already been tried for conduct which is the subject of the complaint, and a trial by the Court is not permitted under article 20, paragraph 3;

:(d)     The case is not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court.’<ref>[http://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/2.htm Article 17] of the Rome Statute. Accessed 2006-12-04.</ref>

Article 20, paragraph 3, specifies that, if a person has already been tried by another court, the ICC cannot try them again for the same conduct unless the proceedings in the other court:

:‘(a)     Were for the purpose of shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court; or

:(b)     Otherwise were not conducted independently or impartially in accordance with the norms of due process recognized by international law and were conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances, was inconsistent with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice.’<ref>[http://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/2.htm Article 20] of the Rome Statute.

[[Image:Flag of the United Nations.svg|thumb|right|150px|The [[United Nations Security Council]] may refer situations to the ICC]]
Unlike the [[International Court of Justice]], the ICC is legally and functionally independent from the United Nations. Nonetheless, the Rome Statute grants the UN a clear role in relation to the Court. The [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] may refer to the Court situations that would not otherwise fall under the Court's jurisdiction (as it did in relation to the situation in [[Darfur]], which the Court could not otherwise have prosecuted as [[Sudan]] is not a state party).  Article 16 of the Rome Statute also allows the Security Council to require the Court to defer from investigating a case for a period of 12 months.<ref name="Article 16">[http://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/2.htm Article 16] of the Rome Statute.

===Darfur, Sudan===
[[Image:Flag of Sudan.svg|right|80px]]
On 31 March 2005, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1593, referring “the situation prevailing in [[Darfur conflict|Darfur]] since 1 July 2002” to the Prosecutor.<ref>United Nations Security Council, 31 March 2006.

===Other situations===
On [[10 February]] [[2006]], the Prosecutor published a letter answering complaints connected with the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].<ref>Luis Moreno-Ocampo, 9 February 2006. [http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/organs/otp/OTP_letter_to_senders_re_Iraq_9_February_2006.pdf ''Letter concerning the situation in Iraq'']. Accessed 2006-11-23.</ref>  He noted that the Court's jurisdiction in Iraq was limited to the actions of nationals of States Parties, and that he did not have authority to consider complaints about the legality of the invasion.  He concluded that the available information constituted a reasonable basis to believe that a limited number of instances of wilful killing and/or inhuman treatment had occurred, but that the crimes allegedly committed by nationals of States Parties in Iraq did not appear to meet the gravity threshold required for an ICC investigation.<ref name=2006report/> {{see also|The International Criminal Court and the 2003 invasion of Iraq}}

==Criticisms of the Court==
===Potential for politically motivated prosecutions===
Opponents of the Court argue that there are “insufficient checks and balances on the authority of the ICC prosecutor and judges” and “insufficient protection against politicized prosecutions or other abuses”.<ref name="US DoS faq">US Department of State, 30 July 2003. [http://www.state.gov/t/pm/rls/fs/23428.htm ''Frequently Asked Questions About the U.S. Government's Policy Regarding the International Criminal Court (ICC)''].  Accessed 31 December 2006.</ref>  [[Henry Kissinger]] has claimed that the checks and balances are so weak that the prosecutor “has virtually unlimited discretion in practice”.<ref name="Kissinger">Henry A. Kissinger.  “The Pitfalls of Universal Jurisdiction”.  ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', July/August 2001, p. 95.  Accessed 31 December 2006.</ref>

===Lack of due process===
Many American critics of the Court, such as the [[Heritage Foundation]], claim that “Americans who appear before the court would be denied such basic constitutional rights as trial by a jury of one's peers, protection from double jeopardy, and the right to confront one's accusers.”<ref name="Heritage">Brett D. Schaefer, 9 January 2001. [http://www.heritage.org/Research/InternationalOrganizations/EM708.cfm ''Overturning Clinton's Midnight Action on the International Criminal Court'']. The [[Heritage Foundation]]. Accessed 2006-11-23.</ref>  

However, [[Human Rights Watch]] argues that “the ICC has one of the most extensive lists of due process guarantees ever written”, including “presumption of innocence; right to counsel; right to present evidence and to confront witnesses; right to remain silent; right to be present at trial; right to have charges proved beyond a reasonable doubt; and protection against double jeopardy”.<ref>Human Rights Watch.  [http://hrw.org/campaigns/icc/facts.htm ''Myths and Facts About the International Criminal Court''].  Accessed 31 December 2006.</ref> According to [[David Scheffer]], who led the US delegation to the Rome Conference (and who voted against adoption of the treaty), “when we were negotiating the Rome treaty, we always kept very close tabs on, ‘Does this meet U.S. constitutional tests, the formation of this court and the due process rights that are accorded defendants?’ And we were very confident at the end of Rome that those due process rights, in fact, are protected, and that this treaty does meet a constitutional test.”<ref>CNN, 2 January 2000. [http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0001/02/bp.00.html ''Burden of Proof'' transcript].  Accessed 31 December 2006.</ref>

===Inequality of arms between prosecution and defence===
Thomas Lubanga's defence team claim that they have been given a smaller budget than the Prosecutor and that evidence and witness statements have been slow to arrive.<ref name="cfr">Stephanie Hanson, 17 November 2006. [http://www.cfr.org/publication/12048/ ''Africa and the International Criminal Court'']. Council on Foreign Relations. Accessed 2006-11-23.</ref>

===Interference with national reconciliation processes===
In the past, governments have granted amnesty to human rights abusers as part of agreements to end conflict.  It is sometimes argued that these amnesties are necessary to allow the peaceful transfer of power from abusive regimes.  By denying states the right to offer amnesty to human rights abusers, the International Criminal Court may make it more difficult to negotiate an end to conflict and a transition to democracy.  Czech politician Marek Benda argues that “[t]he ICC as a deterrent will in our view only mean the worst dictators will try to retain power at all costs.”<ref>Alena Skodova, “[http://www.radio.cz/en/article/26826 Czech parliament against ratifying International Criminal Court]”.  [[Radio Prague]], 12 April 2002.  Accessed 11 January 2007.</ref>  For example, the outstanding arrest warrants for four leaders of the [[Lord's Resistance Army]] are regarded as an obstacle to ending the insurgency in Uganda.<ref>Tim Cocks, 30 May 2007.  “[http://africa.reuters.com/top/news/usnBAN056745.html Uganda urges traditional justice for rebel crimes]”.  Reuters.  Accessed 31 May 2007.</ref><ref>Alasdair Palmer, 14 January 2007.  “[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2007/01/14/do1409.xml When victims want peace, not justice]”.  ''The Sunday Telegraph''.  Accessed 15 January 2007.</ref>

However, the United Nations<ref>See, for example, [[Kofi Annan]], 4 October 2000.  [http://www.afrol.com/Countries/Sierra_Leone/documents/un_sil_court_041000.htm ''Report of the Secretary-General on the establishment of a Special Court for Sierra Leone''], para. 22.  Accessed 31 December 2006.</ref> and the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]]<ref>Jean-Marie Henckaerts & Louise Doswald-Beck, 2005. ''Customary International Humanitarian Law'', Volume I: Rules, pp. 613-614.  Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]].  ISBN 0521005280</ref> maintain that granting amnesty to those accused of war crimes and other serious crimes is a violation of international law.  In any case, Article 16 of the Rome Statute allows the Security Council to prevent the Court from investigating or prosecuting a case,<ref name="Article 16"/> and Article 53 allows the Prosecutor the discretion not to initiate an investigation if he or she believes that “an investigation would not serve the interests of justice”.<ref>[http://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/5.htm Article 53] of the Rome Statute. Accessed 2006-12-31.</ref>  These provisions may allow the Court some leeway to respect national reconciliation processes.

===Crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court===
As noted above, some states were unhappy about the exclusion of [[terrorism]], [[Illegal drug trade|drug trafficking]] and the use of [[weapons of mass destruction]] from the Court's jurisdiction.  The government of India, for example, expressed concern that “the Statute of the ICC lays down, by clear implication, that the use of weapons of mass destruction is not a war crime. This is an extraordinary message to send to the international community.”<ref name="India"/>

Other commentators have argued that the Rome Statute defines crimes too broadly or too vaguely.  For example, China has argued that the definition of ‘war crimes’ goes beyond that accepted under [[customary international law]].<ref>Lu Jianping and Wang Zhixiang. “China's Attitude Towards the ICC” in ''Journal of International Criminal Justice'', July 2005.</ref>
