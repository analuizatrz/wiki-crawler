The '''Calgary Flames''' are a [[professional]] [[ice hockey]] team based in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]]. They are members of the [[Northwest Division (NHL)|Northwest Division]] of the [[Western Conference (NHL)|Western Conference]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL). The club is the third major-professional ice hockey team to represent the city of Calgary, following the [[Calgary Tigers]] (1921–27) and [[Calgary Cowboys]] (1975–77). The Flames are one of two NHL franchises in Alberta, the other being the [[Edmonton Oilers]]. The cities' proximity has led to a famous rivalry, known as the [[Battle of Alberta]]. Games between the teams are often heated events.<ref>{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Francis |title=The uncivil war...Edmonton...April 23, 1988...Oilers 4 Flames 2 |url=http://www.slam.ca/Slam030917/col_francis-sun.html |publisher=[[Calgary Sun]] |date=2003-09-17 |accessdate=2006-11-28 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Francis |author= |title=The uncivil war...Calgary...January 20, 2003...Flames 3 Oilers 2 |url=http://fun.canoe.ca/Slam030921/col_francis-sun.html |publisher=[[Calgary Sun]] |date=2003-09-21 |accessdate=2006-11-28 }}</ref> 

The Flames arrived in the city of Calgary in 1980 after spending their first eight seasons in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], as the [[Atlanta Flames]]. The Flames played their first three seasons in Calgary at the [[Stampede Corral]] before moving into their current home arena, the [[Pengrowth Saddledome|Olympic Saddledome]] (now Pengrowth Saddledome), in [[1983-84 Calgary Flames season|1983]]. In [[1985-86 Calgary Flames season|1986]], the Flames became the first Calgary team since the Tigers in [[1923-24 WCHL season|1924]] to compete for the [[Stanley Cup]].  In [[1988-89 Calgary Flames season|1989]], the Flames captured the Cup for the first time.  The Flames' unexpected run to the [[2004 Stanley Cup Finals]] captured the imagination of Canadians, leading [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Paul Martin]] to dub them "Canada's team", while the [[Red Mile]] celebrations by fans became nationally famous.

Off the ice, the Flames own a [[Western Hockey League]] franchise, the [[Calgary Hitmen]], and in 2007 opened a sports bar and entertainment centre called ''Flames Central'' on [[Stephen Avenue]] in Downtown Calgary.  Through the ''Flames Foundation'', the team has donated over [[Canadian dollar|$]]29-million to charity throughout southern Alberta since the franchise arrived.

{{main|Atlanta Flames}}

The Flames were the result of the NHL's first pre-emptive strike against the upstart [[World Hockey Association]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Boer |first=Peter |title=The Calgary Flames |year=2006 |pages=12 |publisher=Overtime Books |isbn=1-897277-07-5 }}</ref>  In December [[1971-72 NHL season|1971]], the NHL hastily granted a team to [[Long Island]]&mdash;the [[New York Islanders]]&mdash;to keep the WHA's [[New York Raiders]] out of the brand new [[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum]].  This came less than a year after the [[Vancouver Canucks]] and [[Buffalo Sabres]] joined the league.  Needing another team to balance the schedule, the NHL awarded a team to an [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]]-based group that owned the [[National Basketball Association]]'s [[Atlanta Hawks]], headed by prominent local real estate developer [[Tom Cousins]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nhl/nyi/nylsanders.html|title=History of the New York Islanders|work=Sports E-Cyclopedia|publisher=Tank Productions|accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref> Cousins named the team the "Flames" after the [[fire]] resulting from the [[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]] in the [[American Civil War]] by [[General William Tecumseh Sherman]], in which Atlanta was nearly destroyed.  They played home games in the [[Omni Coliseum]] in downtown Atlanta.<ref name="atlflames">{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nhl/atlflames/aflames.html|title=History of the Atlanta Flames|work=Sports E-Cyclopedia|publisher=Tank Productions|accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref>

[[Image:Atlanta flames goal hug 1978.jpg|thumb|175px|left|[[Tom Lysiak]] (l.) celebrates with teammates after a goal against the [[Colorado Rockies (NHL)|Colorado Rockies]] in 1978]]
The Flames were relatively successful early on.  Under head coaches [[Bernie Geoffrion|Bernie “Boom Boom” Geoffrion]], [[Fred Creighton]] and [[Al MacNeil]], the Flames made the playoffs in six of eight seasons in Atlanta.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/teamseasons.php?tid=235|title=Atlanta Flames seasons|work=The Internet Hockey Database|accessdate=2008-01-03}}</ref> In marked contrast, their expansion cousins, the Islanders, won only 31 games during their first two years in the league combined.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/teamseasons.php?tid=52|title=New York Islanders seasons|work=The Internet Hockey Database|accessdate=2008-01-03}}</ref>  This relative success would not translate in the playoffs, however, as the Flames won only two post-season games during their time in Atlanta.<ref>{{cite book |title=2006–07 Calgary Flames Media Guide |publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club |pages=pg. 219 |editor=Hanlon, Peter and Kelso, Sean}}
</ref>  

Despite the on-ice success, the Atlanta ownership was never on sound financial footing.  Fletcher said years later that Cousins' initial financial projections for an NHL team did not account for the WHA entering the picture.<ref name="fletcher">{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/hockeyu/halloffame/fletcher110304.html |title=Building a franchise is Flether's forte |accessdate=2006-11-28 |last=McGourty |first=John |date=2004-11-03 |publisher=nhl.com}}</ref><ref name="HockeyChron">{{cite book |last=Duhatschek |first=Eric et al. |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Hockey Chronicles |year=2001 |publisher=Checkmark Books |location=New York City |isbn=0816046972}}</ref>  The Flames were also a poor draw, and failed to sign a major television contract.<ref name="atlflames"/>  

In 1980, Cousins was in considerable financial difficulty and was forced to sell the Flames to stave off bankruptcy.  With few serious offers from local groups, he was very receptive to an offer from a group of Calgary businessmen fronted by Canadian entrepreneur (and former Oilers owner) [[Nelson Skalbania]].<ref name="atlflames"/>  A last-ditch effort to keep the team in Atlanta fell short, and Cousins sold the team to Skalbania for [[United States dollar|US]]$16 million. a record sale price for an NHL team at the time.<ref name="HockeyChron"/> In May 21, 1980, Skalbania announced that the team would move to Calgary.<ref name="FlamesHistory">{{cite book |title=2006–07 Calgary Flames Media Guide |publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club |editor=Hanlon, Peter and Kelso, Sean |pages=pg. 4}}</ref> He chose to retain the Flames name, feeling it would be a good fit for an oil town like Calgary, while the flaming "A" logo was replaced by a flaming "C".<ref>{{cite book |title=The Name Game: Football, Baseball, Hockey & Basketball How Your Favorite Sports Teams Were Named |last=Donovan |first=Michael Leo |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1997 |publisher=Warwick Publishing |location=[[Toronto]] |isbn=1895629748 |pages= }}</ref>  Skalbania sold his interest in 1981, and the Flames have been locally owned since.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oilersheritage.com/legacy/contributions_owners_nelsonskalbania2.html|title=Nelson Skalbania|work=Edmonton Oilers Heritage|accessdate=2007-06-18}}</ref>

===1980–1985===
[[Image:PengrowthSaddledomeNight.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The Flames moved into the [[Pengrowth Saddledome|Olympic Saddledome]] in 1983.]]

Unlike the WHA's [[Calgary Cowboys]], who folded three years previous, the Flames were immediately embraced by the city of Calgary.  While the Cowboys could manage to sell only 2,000 season tickets in their final campaign of [[1976-77 WHA season|1976–77]], the Flames sold 10,000 full- and half-season ticket packages in the 7,000 seat [[Stampede Corral]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Zeman |first=Gary |title=Alberta on Ice |year=1986 |publisher=Heritage House |pages=94 |isbn=0969232004}}
</ref>

Led by [[Kent Nilsson]]'s 49-goal, 131-point season, the Flames qualified for the playoffs in their first season in Calgary with a 39–27–4 record, good for third in the [[Patrick Division]].<ref name="regularseason">{{cite book |title=2007–08 Calgary Flames Media Guide |publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club |pages=pg. 105 |editor=Hanlon, Peter and Kelso, Sean}}</ref> The team found much greater playoff success in Calgary than it did in Atlanta, winning their first two playoff series over the [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]] and [[Philadelphia Flyers]] before bowing out to the [[Minnesota North Stars]] in the semi-finals.<ref>{{cite book |title=2006–07 Calgary Flames Media Guide |publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club |pages=pg. 131 |editor=Hanlon, Peter and Kelso, Sean}}</ref>  This early success was not soon repeated. After a losing record in [[1981-82 NHL season|1981–82]], General Manager [[Cliff Fletcher]] jettisoned several former Atlanta players who couldn't adjust to the higher-pressure hockey environment and rebuilt the roster.<ref>{{cite book |last=Boer |first=Peter |title=The Calgary Flames |year=2006 |pages=51 |publisher=Overtime Books |isbn=1-897277-07-5 }}</ref><ref name="HockeyChron"/> Over the next three seasons, he put together a core of players that would remain together through the early 1990s.

Fletcher's efforts to match the Oilers led him to draw talent from areas previously neglected by the NHL. The Flames were among the earliest teams to sign large numbers of U.S. college players, including [[Joel Otto]], [[Gary Suter]] and [[Colin Patterson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://couchpotatohockey.com/Teams/Team%20Biographies/Calgary.asp|title=Calgary Flames Team Biography|publisher=Couchpotatohockey |accessdate=2007-12-07}}</ref> Fletcher also stepped up the search for European hockey talent, acquiring [[Håkan Loob|Hakan Loob]] and other key players. He was among the first to [[NHL Entry Draft|draft]] players from the [[Soviet Union]], including [[HC CSKA Moscow]] star [[Sergei Makarov]] in [[1983 NHL Entry Draft|1983]], but Soviet players were not released to Western teams until 1989.<ref name="soviet">{{cite web |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/news/2002/09/27/soviet_legacy/ |title=Sweeping changes |author=Dolezar, John A. |date=2002-09-27 |accessdate=2007-12-07 |publisher=Sports Illustrated}}</ref>  Still, the team was sufficiently improved to challenge the Oilers, who required the maximum seven games to defeat the Flames en route to their [[1983-84 NHL season|1984]] [[Stanley Cup]] Championship.<ref name="playoffresults">{{cite book |title=2007–08 Calgary Flames Media Guide |publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club |pages=pg. 232 |editor=Hanlon, Peter and Kelso, Sean}}</ref>

In 1983, the Flames moved into their new home, the Olympic Saddledome (now known as the [[Pengrowth Saddledome]]).  Located on the grounds of the [[Calgary Exhibition and Stampede]], the Saddledome was built as a venue for the [[1988 Winter Olympics]].  In three seasons in the Corral, the Flames lost only 32 home games.<ref name="FlamesHistory" />  The Saddledome hosted the 37th [[NHL All-Star Game]] in 1985, a 6–4 victory by the [[Wales Conference]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.detroithockey.net/nhl/allstar.php |title=NHL All-Star Games |accessdate=2008-01-03 |publisher=detroithockey.net}}</ref>

===1985–1990===
[[Image:Calgary Flames logo 1980-1994.png|125px|left|thumb|The original Flames logo, used from 1980–94. A black outline was added in 1995.]]
The players acquired by Fletcher matured into one of the strongest teams in the league during the mid-1980s and early 1990s. From [[1984-85 NHL season|1984-85]] to [[1990-91 NHL season|1990-91]], the Flames tallied 90 points in every season but one.  <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/teamseasons.php?tid=43 |title=Calgary Flames seasons |accessdate=2008-01-03 |publisher=The Internet Hockey Database}}</ref>  However, they were usually unable to transform that success into a deep playoff run,  largely because they could not get the better of their provincial rivals, the powerhouse Oilers.  The NHL's playoff structure of the time made it very likely that the Flames would meet the Oilers in either the first or second round, rather than in the conference finals.<ref name="HockeyChron"/>  From 1983 until 1990, either the Oilers or the Flames represented the Campbell Conference in the Stanley Cup Finals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/columns/story?columnist=johnson_george&id=2191048 |title=Bile back in Battle of Alberta |accessdate=2008-01-03 |date=2005-10-17 |publisher=ESPN |author=Johnson, George}}</ref>  

By [[1985-86 NHL season|1986]] the Flames had landed forwards [[Doug Risebrough]], [[Lanny McDonald]], and [[Dan Quinn]], defenceman [[Al MacInnis]], and goaltender [[Mike Vernon (ice hockey)|Mike Vernon]].  Finishing second in the Smythe with a 40–31–6 record (the only season from 1984 to 1991 in which they did not finish with 90 or more points),<ref name="regularseason" /> the Flames swept the [[Winnipeg Jets]] in the first round of the playoffs,<ref name="playoffresults" /> setting up a showdown with the Oilers.  Edmonton finished 30 points ahead of Calgary during the season, and was heavily favoured to win a third Cup in a row.  However, the Flames upset the Oilers in seven games, with the series-winning goal coming at the hands of Oilers' rookie [[James Stephen Smith|Steve Smith]] as he accidentally shot the puck off of goaltender [[Grant Fuhr]]'s leg and into his own net.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oilersheritage.com/history/dynasty_players_stevesmith.html  |title=Dynasty Players: Steve Smith |accessdate=2007-12-07 |publisher=Edmonton Oilers Heritage}}</ref> The goal remains one of the most legendary blunders in hockey history.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/nhl/features/si_stanley_cup/1986/ |title=SI Flashback: Stanley Cup 1986 |author=Swift, E.M.|accessdate=2007-12-07 |publisher=Sports Illustrated}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/stanleycup2006/content/features/topgame7.html |title=Top 10: Game 7's |accessdate=2007-12-07 |publisher=CBC Sports}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/chokes/hockey.html |title=Biggest Stanley Cup playoff chokes |accessdate=2007-12-07 |publisher=ESPN}}</ref>

From there, the Flames went on to the Campbell Conference Finals, where they defeated the [[St. Louis Blues (hockey)|St. Louis Blues]] in another seven-game series.  This time, Calgary had to survive a scare of its own, shaking off the [[The Monday Night Miracle (ice hockey)|Monday Night Miracle]] at the [[St. Louis Arena]]. Trailing by a score of 5-2 with 10 minutes to play in the third period of Game 6, the Blues mounted a furious comeback to send the contest into overtime, where [[Doug Wickenheiser]] scored to force a deciding seventh game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/special/pd125.nsf/0/8562839B99EBB29186256E0700728192?OpenDocument |title=Birth of the Blues |author=Goold, Derrick |date=2004-01-20 |accessdate=2007-12-07 |publisher=St. Louis Post Dispatch}}</ref>  Calgary would win Game 7 at home, 2–1, advancing into the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time.<ref name="playoffresults" />  In the Cup Finals, the Flames proved to be no match for the [[Montreal Canadiens]], losing in five games.  Montreal [[rookie]] goaltender [[Patrick Roy]] was nearly unstoppable in the last two games, allowing only four goals en route to winning the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]].  

The Flames followed up their run to the Finals with their best regular seasons in team history.  Calgary's 46–31–3 record in [[1986-87 NHL season|1986–87]] was good for third overall in the NHL.<ref>{{cite book |title=2006–07 Calgary Flames Media Guide |publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club |editor=Hanlon, Peter and Kelso, Sean |pages=pg. 125}}</ref> However, the Flames were unable to duplicate their playoff success of a year prior, losing their first round match-up with the [[Winnipeg Jets]] in six games.  The season was also difficult off the ice, as [[1986 NHL Entry Draft|1986]] first round draft pick [[George Pelawa]] was killed in a car accident prior to the season's start.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.canoe.ca/Slam031008/col_ulmer-sun.html |title=Heat is on |author=Ulmer, Mike |date=2003-10-08 |accessdate=2007-12-07 |publisher=Toronto Sun}}</ref>  

The Flames recorded their first 100-point season in [[1987-88 NHL season|1987–88]], earning the [[Presidents' Trophy]] for having the league's best record and ending the Oilers' six-year reign atop the Smythe Division in the process.<ref name="1987-88">{{cite book |title=2006–07 Calgary Flames Media Guide |publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club |editor=Hanlon, Peter and Kelso, Sean |pages=pg. 124}}</ref> However, they were swept by the Oilers in the second round of the playoffs.<ref name="playoffresults" />  [[Joe Nieuwendyk]] became the second rookie in league history to score 50+ goals, earning the [[Calder Memorial Trophy]] as rookie of the year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=11194 |title=Joe Nieuwendyk player profile |accessdate=2007-12-07 |publisher=legendsofhockey.net |work=Hockey Hall of Fame}}</ref>  Looking to bolster the line-up for a playoff run, the Flames dealt young sniper [[Brett Hull]], along with [[Steve Bozek]], to the Blues for [[Rob Ramage]] and [[Rick Wamsley]] on March 7, 1988.<ref name="gilmourtrade">{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/nhl/news/2001/08/08/sayitaintso_flames/ |title=Say it aint so: Calgary Flames |publisher=Sports Illustrated |author=Dolezar, John A |date=2001-08-08 |accessdate=2007-05-14}}</ref>  Their playoff frustrations continued, however, when after defeating the [[Los Angeles Kings]] in five games, Calgary was swept out of the playoffs in four straight by the Oilers.<ref name="playoffresults" />

[[Image:FlamesBanners.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Calgary's [[1988-89 Calgary Flames season|1988–89 Championship]] banner hangs alongside [[Lanny McDonald]]'s retired jersey.]]
In [[1988-89 NHL season|1988–89]], the Flames continued to improve.  They captured their second consecutive Presidents' Trophy with a franchise record 117 points, finishing 26 points better than the second-place Kings in the Smythe Division.<ref>{{cite book |title=2006–07 Calgary Flames Media Guide |publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club |editor=Hanlon, Peter and Kelso, Sean |pages=pg. 123}}</ref>  Fletcher continued to tinker with the roster, acquiring [[Doug Gilmour]] as part of a six player deal at the trade deadline. In the playoffs, the Flames were stretched to seven games in the first round by the Canucks, relying on several saves by goaltender [[Mike Vernon (ice hockey)|Mike Vernon]], including a famous glove save off a [[Stan Smyl]] breakaway in overtime.  The save remains a defining moment in Flames history.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam040416/nhl_calvan8-sun.html |title=Smyl doesn't lose sleep over big save |author=Sportak, Randy |date=2004-04-16 |accessdate=2007-12-07 |publisher=Calgary Sun}}</ref>  [[Joel Otto]] would score the winning goal.

The Flames then made short work of the Kings, defeating them in four straight, before eliminating the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] in five games to set up a rematch of the [[1986 Stanley Cup Finals]] against Montreal.  This time, the Flames won in six games, the last being a 4–2 victory in Montreal on May 25, 1989.<ref name="playoffresults" /> The clinching win was especially significant in that it marked the only time that an opposing team defeated the Canadiens to win the Stanley Cup on [[Montreal Forum]] ice.<ref name="lanny">{{cite web |last=McGourty |first=John |url=http://www.nhl.com/hockeyu/history/cup/mcdonald052301.html |title=Lanny, Stanley into the sunset |date=2001-05-23 |publisher=NHL.com |accessdate=2007-12-07}}</ref> Al MacInnis captured the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] as playoffs most valuable player,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/html/ind07MacInnis.htm |title=Al MacInnis |publisher=legendsofhockey.net |work=Hockey Hall of Fame |accessdate=2000-01-04}}</ref> while long-time captain Lanny McDonald announced his retirement.<ref name="lanny" /> The 1989 Stanley Cup win gave Flames co-owner, [[Sonia Scurfield]], the distinction of being the first (and only) Canadian woman to have her name engraved on the [[Stanley Cup]].

In 1989, thanks in part to [[Cliff Fletcher]]'s diplomatic efforts, the Soviets finally gave permission for a select group of Soviet hockey players to sign with NHL teams. The first of these players was [[Sergei Pryakhin]]. Although Pryakhin never became an NHL regular, his arrival blazed a trail for the large number of Russian players who entered the NHL beginning in [[1989-90 NHL season|1989–90]].<ref name="soviet" /> Sergei Makarov joined the Flames that season and, though already in his thirties, became the fifth Flame to win the [[Calder Memorial Trophy]] as the league's Rookie of the Year. The selection would prove controversial, prompting the league to amend the rules to exclude any player over the age of 26 from future consideration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE4DA103EF933A15755C0A966958260 |title=New Rules for Rookies |date=1990-06-20 |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=2007-06-10}}</ref>

===1991–2003===
[[Image:Calgary Flames horse head logo.png|right|thumb|125px|Calgary's alternate logo, 1999–2007]]
In 1991, Fletcher left the Flames to become the general manager of the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]].  He had been the team's general manager since its inception in 1972.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/html/spot_oneononeb200401.htm |title=One on One with Cliff Fletcher |publisher=legendsofhockey.net |work=Hockey Hall of Fame |accessdate=2007-05-14}}</ref>  He was succeeded in Calgary by Doug Risebrough, and the two quickly completed a ten player mega-trade that saw disgruntled forward [[Doug Gilmour]] dealt to Toronto with four other players for former 50 goal scorer [[Gary Leeman]] and four others.<ref name="gilmourtrade" />  The trade transformed both clubs.  The formerly inept Leafs turned into a contender almost immediately, while Leeman scored only eleven goals in a Flames uniform.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2003/03/13/leafs_flames030313.html |title=Gilmour begins again with Leafs in Calgary |publisher=CBC Sports |date=2003-04-13 |accessdate=2007-05-14}}</ref>  Despite the blossoming of [[Theoren Fleury]] into an NHL star, the Flames missed the playoffs entirely in [[1991-92 NHL season|1992]], only a year after finishing with their third 100-point season in franchise history.  It was the first time the Flames had missed the playoffs since [[1974-75 NHL season|1975]], when they were still in Atlanta.  It was also only the third time out of the playoffs in the franchise's 20-year history.<ref name="playoffresults" />

[[Image:JaromeIginla.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Jarome Iginla]] was one of the team's few bright spots during its seven year playoff drought]]
Calgary rebounded to make the playoffs for the next four seasons, including two consecutive division titles. However, they failed move past the first round of the playoffs each time.  The [[1993-94 NHL season|1994]] and [[1994-95 NHL season|1995]] Division titles led to Game 7 home defeats in the opening round to the Canucks, and then the [[San Jose Sharks]], both lost in Double overtime. In the [[1993-94 NHL season|1995-96 Season]], Nieuwendyk would hold out and was later traded to the [[Dallas Stars]] in a deal that acquired [[Jarome Iginla]]. Iginla would make his Flames debut in the 1996 postseason, but the Flames again were beaten in the opening round again, this time in a four game sweep by the [[Chicago Blackhawks]]. In [[1996-97 NHL season|1997]], only two years after winning their second consecutive division title, the Flames missed the playoffs and would not return for seven years.<ref name="playoffresults" />  The low point came in the [[1997-98 NHL season|1997-98 season]], in which the Flames finished with only 67 points--the second-lowest point total in franchise history<ref name="SportsEnc">{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nhl/calgary/calflames.html|title=History of the Calgary Flames|work=Sports E-Cyclopedia|publisher=Tank Productions|accessdate=2008-01-26}}</ref> (and only two points below the 1972-73 Atlanta Flames)<ref name="atlflames"/>.

During this time, the Flames found it increasingly difficult to hold onto their best players, as salaries escalated while the [[Canadian Dollar]] lost value against the [[United States|American Dollar]].<ref name="usatoday">{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/cup/2004-05-25-flames-cover_x.htm  |title=Flames: Bright spot for Canada |publisher=USA Today |author=Gardiner, Andy |date=2004-05-25 |accessdate=2007-12-07}}</ref>  The NHL's small-market Canadian teams found it increasingly difficult to compete in the new environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/columns/story?columnist=cox_damien&id=3098820 |title=What is Ottawa's success worth to Canadians, NHL?

Fleury was due to become an unrestricted [[free agent]] at the end of the season, and the Flames didn't want to risk losing him without getting anything in return.<ref>[http://www.canoe.ca/HockeyFleuryTrade/feb28_fla.html Emotional Fleury finds new home with Avalanche<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

As the Flames sank in the standings, their attendance also sagged.  For most of their first 16 years in Calgary, Flames tickets were among the toughest in the NHL.  However, by 1999, attendance had fallen off so severely that the owners issued an ultimatum--buy more season tickets or the team would join its departed counterparts in Winnipeg and [[Quebec Nordiques|Quebec City]] in leaving for the United States.  The fans responded by buying enough season tickets to keep the Flames in Calgary for the [[2000-01 NHL season|2000-01 season]].<ref name="HockeyChron"/>  However, the Flames were forced to issue another appeal for more season tickets in the summer of 2000. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2000/05/18/flames00518.html |title=Flames aim to save team by end of June |publisher=CBC Sports |date=2000-05-18 |accessdate=2007-12-06}}</ref>  The campaign, aimed at increasing season ticket sales from a franchise low of 8,700 to 14,000, proved successful.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2000/06/29/flames000629.html |title=Flames reach season ticket goal |publisher=CBC Sports |date=2000-11-10 |accessdate=2007-12-06}}</ref>  The increased sales did not halt the Flames' financial losses, however, as the team estimated it lost $14.5 million between 2001 and 2003.<ref name="usatoday" />

One of the few bright spots in this stretch was Iginla, who captured the [[Rocket Richard Trophy|Rocket Richard]] and [[Art Ross Trophy|Art Ross]] Trophies in [[2001-02 Calgary Flames season|2001–02]] as NHL goal- and point-scoring champion after scoring 52 goals and 96 points.

Regehr had suffered two broken legs in a car accident the summer of 1999, but recovered in time to play 57 games at the age of 19.<ref>{{cite book |title=2006–07 Calgary Flames Media Guide |publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club |editor=Hanlon, Peter and Kelso, Sean |pages=pg. 61}}</ref>

During the [[2002-03 Calgary Flames season|2002–03 season]], the Flames hired [[Darryl Sutter]] as the team's head coach, replacing [[Greg Gilbert]], who was fired as the Flames languished in last place in the Western Conference.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web02.nm.cbc.ca/sports/story/2002/12/28/flames021228.html |title=Flames hire coach Darryl Sutter |date=2002-12-28 |accessdate=2008-01-04 |publisher=CBC Sports}}</ref> Sutter also became the team's general manager following the season, and is credited with revitalizing the franchise.<ref>{{cite web |author=Johnson, George |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/columns/story?columnist=johnson_george&id=2291711 |title=In Sutter, Flames (and fans) trust |date=2006-01-23 |accessdate=2008-01-04 |publisher=ESPN}}</ref> Among Sutter's first moves was to acquire goaltender [[Miikka Kiprusoff]], whom he had previously coached in [[San Jose Sharks|San Jose]], early in the [[2003-04 Calgary Flames season|2003–04]] season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/teams/players/bio/?hubname=nhl-flames&id=292 |title=Miikka Kiprusoff profile |accessdate=2008-01-04 |publisher=tsn.ca}}</ref> Kiprusoff responded by setting a modern NHL record for lowest [[goals against average]] at 1.69.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlpa.com/WebStats/PlayerBiography.asp?ID=2873 |title=Miikka Kiprusoff profile |accessdate=2008-01-04 |publisher=nhlpa.com}}</ref>

===2004–present===

After seven consecutive seasons of not making the playoffs, the Flames finally returned to the post-season in 2004.  The Flames became the first team in NHL history to defeat three division champions<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/columns/kreiser/flames050704.html |title=Flames scorch foes,

Flames' first victim was the Northwest Division champion Vancouver Canucks, whom they defeated in seven games.

Sports}}</ref>

The Flames then upset the [[Detroit Red Wings]], who had garnered the league's best record, in six games. After eliminating the Pacific Division champs, the [[San Jose Sharks]], in six games in the Western Conference Final, the Flames earned a trip to the [[2004 Stanley Cup Finals]] to face the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]]. The Canadian Embassy in [[Washington, D.C.]], flew the Flames flag beside the [[Flag of Canada|Maple Leaf]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/viewpoint/vp_hwang/20040528.html |title=Cheering for the home team |accessdate=2006-11-28 |date=2004-05-28 |last=Hwang |first=Rosa |publisher=CBC Sports}}</ref>  while [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Paul Martin]] dubbed the Flames "Canada's team".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://calgary-flames-news.newslib.com/story/981-245220/ |title=Martin dubs Calgary Flames 'Canada's Team' |accessdate=2006-12-23 |date=2004-05-30 |publisher=CTV Sports}}</ref>

The final series went to seven games, with the Flames suffering a controversial non-goal in game six at home.  Replays showed that [[Martin Gélinas|Martin Gelinas]] came close to scoring what would have been the go-ahead goal late in the third period; however, the referees never signaled a goal, and later replays were ruled inconclusive.  The Lightning would go on to win the game in [[overtime (hockey)|double overtime]],<ref>{{cite news |first=Damian |last=Cristodero |title= One last shot |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2004/06/06/Lightning/One_last_shot.shtml |publisher=St. Petersberg Times |date=2004-06-06 |accessdate=2006-11-28}}</ref> before winning game seven at home to capture the Stanley Cup.

The Flames would not raise their Western Conference championship banner for nearly 15 months, as the [[2004-05 NHL season|2004–05 season]] was wiped out by a [[2004-05 NHL lockout|labour dispute]].  During the lockout, team owner and [[Chair (official)|Chairman of the Board]], [[Harley Hotchkiss]], attempted to save the season by engaging in discussions with [[National Hockey League Players Association]] president [[Trevor Linden]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Ira |last=Podel |title=Linden, Hotchkiss to meet again |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/nhl/2005-01-19-lockout-meeting_x.htm |publisher=USA Today |date=2005-01-19 |accessdate=2008-01-04}}</ref>  While their discussions failed to save the season, Hotchkiss was credited with easing tensions that allowed for a successful negotiation of a new [[collective bargaining agreement]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Morris |last=Dalla Costa |title=Hotchkiss happy where NHL is now |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Hockey/NHL/Calgary/2007/09/21/4514738-sun.html |publisher=Calgary Sun |date=2007-09-21 |accessdate=2008-01-04}}</ref>

[[Image:Miikka Kiprusoff.jpg|thumb|left|Miikka Kiprusoff won the Vezina Trophy as the NHL's top goaltender in 2005–06.]]
The Flames played their 25th season in Calgary in [[2005-06 NHL season|2005–06]], finishing with 103 points. It was their best total since the 1989 Cup winning season, and good enough to capture their first division title in 12 years. However, the Flames lost to the [[Anaheim Ducks|Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]] in seven games during the first round of the playoffs. [[Miikka Kiprusoff]] captured both the [[William M. Jennings Trophy]] and the [[Vezina Trophy]] as the NHL's top goaltender, while defenceman [[Dion Phaneuf]] set a franchise record for goals by a rookie blue-liner with 20.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/news/2006/05/271296.html |title=NHL announces 2005–06 trophy finalists |accessdate=2007-12-23 |date=2006-06-24 |publisher=NHL.com}}</ref>

The 2006 off-season began with a trade for [[Alex Tanguay]], formerly of the [[Colorado Avalanche]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/draft2006/news/story?id=2499645 |title=Avs send Tanguay to Flames for Leopold, picks |accessdate=2006-11-28 |date=2006-05-04 |publisher=nhl.com}}</ref> and with [[Darryl Sutter]] relinquishing his head coaching position to assistant [[Jim Playfair]] so he could focus on his duties as general manager.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=171090&hubname=nhl |title=Sutter steps down as Flames coach |accessdate=2006-11-28 |publisher=TSN}}</ref> Despite a marked improvement in team offence and a solid 96-point season, the Flames were pushed into eighth place in the Western Conference, largely because seven teams in the West finished with over 100 points. In the playoffs, Calgary fell in six games to the top seeded Detroit Red Wings in the first round.  During the series, the Flames were fined by the NHL for several stick-related penalties in the fifth game.  Notably, backup goaltender [[Jamie McLennan]] was suspended five games for slashing Red Wings forward [[Johan Franzén]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globesports.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070422.wmclennan0422/GSStory/GlobeSportsHockey/home |title=Five-game suspension for McLennan |author=Duhatschek, Eric |date=2007-04-22 |accessdate=2007-12-07 |publisher=The Globe and Mail}}</ref> Franzén would score the series clinching goal in the Game 6 defeat in Double Overtime.

Prior to the start of the [[2007-08 NHL season|2007–08 season]], the Flames demoted Playfair to associate coach, bringing in [[Mike Keenan]] as the team's third head coach in three years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=210816&hubname= |title=Flames name Keenan new head coach |date=2007-06-14 |accessdate=2007-12-07 |publisher=TSN}}</ref>  During the season, Jarome Iginla became the Flames' all-time leader in games played, passing Al MacInnis' mark of 803. Iginla also passed [[Theoren Fleury]]'s mark of 364 goals to become the Flames all-time goal scoring leader on March 10, 2008. Despite a 94-point season and 7th place seed in the western conference, they fell in the quarterfinals to the Pacific Division champion San Jose Sharks in seven games.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gLlgpm1thLzwuB4tBHEllmlPsUqQD8VB2FKG0 |title=Iginla Tops Flames' Goal Record in Win  |date=2008-03-10 |accessdate=2008-03-18 |publisher=Associated Press}}</ref>

==Community impact==
[[Image:Flamescentral.JPG|thumb|right|''Flames Central'' is a downtown restaurant and bar owned by the Flames.]]
In 1994, the Flames approached the Saddledome Foundation with a proposal to renovate the [[Pengrowth Saddledome|Olympic Saddledome]], rename it the ''Canadian Airlines Saddledome'' and take over management of the facility.  The board agreed to this proposal, and was bought out by the Flames for [[Canadian Dollar|$]]20 million as the team signed a 20-year agreement to manage the building.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://publicaccess.calgary.ca/lldm01/livelink.exe?func=ccpa.general&msgID=BesTceqqTH&msgAction=Download |title=The Saddledome Foundation – An Historical Perspective ||format=DOC |accessdate=2008-09-17 |publisher=City of Calgary}}</ref>

Looking to fill extra dates in the Saddledome, the Flames agreed to a lease deal with the expansion [[Calgary Hitmen]] of the [[junior ice hockey|junior]] [[Western Hockey League]] who began play in 1995 and were partly owned by [[Theoren Fleury]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Larry |last=Tucker |title=Method to this madness |page=62 |work=Calgary Sun |date=1994-06-24}}</ref> Two years later, in 1997, the Flames bought the team for $1.5 million.<ref>{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Miller |title=Hitmen finally go up in Flames |work=Calgary Sun |page=S5 |date=1997-06-14}}</ref>  During the [[2004–05 NHL lockout]], the Flames heavily marketed the Hitmen, and as a result, the team led all professional or junior teams in North America in attendance, averaging over 10,000 fans per game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Hockey/Junior/2005/03/19/966358-sun.html |title=Kisio on the hot seat |accessdate=2008-04-08 |author=Francis, Eric |date=2005-03-19 |work=Calgary Sun}}</ref>

In April 2006, the Flames announced that they would be opening a hybrid restaurant, bar and entertainment facility in downtown Calgary on [[Stephen Avenue]]. In announcing the venture, Flames' President and CEO Ken King stated: "While hockey remains our core competency, we are constantly seeking new opportunities in which to grow the Flames brand and allow our fans greater opportunities to enjoy hockey. We believe establishing a location outside of the Pengrowth Saddledome to share food, fun and hockey will bring our fans even closer to the team."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flamescentral.com/press.php?04202006 |title=The Calgary Flames and Concorde Entertainment Group announce venture to introduce hybrid restaurant, bar and entertainment facility to open in August 2006 |accessdate=2008-09-17 |date=2006-04-20 |work=Calgary Flames Hockey Club}}</ref>   One year later, in April 2007, ''Flames Central'' opened to the public.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flamescentral.com/press.php?04102007 |title=Flames Central and Wildfire Grill open to public|accessdate=2008-09-17 |date=2007-04-10 |work=Calgary Flames Hockey Club}}</ref>

===Flames Foundation===
The Flames have maintained an active presence in the community since their arrival in Calgary.  Through the team's non-profit charity, the ''Flames Foundation'', the team has donated over $29 million to causes throughout southern Alberta.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://flames.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&page=NHLPage&bcid=com_ffcr |title=Community |accessdate=2007-12-07 |publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club}}</ref>  Along with the [[Rotary International|Rotary Club]], the Flames are helping to fund the first children's [[hospice]] in Alberta, and one of only six in North America.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/calgary/story/2007/05/09/hospice-alberta.html |title=Alberta to get first children's hospice |date=2007-05-09 |accessdate=2007-12-07 |publisher=CBC}}</ref>

The Flames are also close partners with the [[Alberta Children's Hospital]].  Among the many activities the Flames participate in, the ''Wheelchair Hockey Challenge'' with the Townsend Tigers has remained a highly popular tradition for both the players and the children involved.  In 2007, the Tigers defeated the Flames 10–9, to move to a perfect 26–0 record since the challenge was first instituted in 1981.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://flames.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&page=NewsPage&articleid=344100 |title=Townsend Tigers extend winning streak to 26 |date=2007-11-21 |accessdate=2007-12-07 |publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club}}</ref>

===Red Mile===
{{main|Red Mile}}

During the Flames' run to the Stanley Cup Finals of 2004, the city of Calgary essentially became the host of a "non-stop party". The 17th Avenue SW entertainment district, which runs west from the Pengrowth Saddledome, saw as many as 35,000 fans pack the streets during the first three rounds of the playoffs,<ref name="usatoday" /> and over 60,000 in the finals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://calgary.ctv.ca/servlet/RTGAMArticleHTMLTemplate/A/20040604/flameswingame5?brand=generic&hub=&tf=CFCNPlus/generic/hubs/frontpage.html&cf=CFCNPlus/generic/hubs/frontpage.cfg&slug=flameswingame5&date=20040604&archive=CFCNPlus&ad_page_name=&nav=home&subnav=fullstory |title=Police brace for another big night on the Red Mile|publisher=CTV Sports |date=2004-06-04|accessdate=2007-12-06}}</ref> The Red Mile party received widespread coverage in newspapers across North America,<ref>{{cite web |last=James |first=Brant |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2004/05/20/Sports/Flames_reach_Stanley_.shtml |title=Flames reach Stanley Cup final |publisher=St. Petersberg Times |date=2004-05-20 |accessdate=2007-12-07}}</ref> as the parties remained peaceful and incidents were minimal despite the large number of people in a small area.<ref name="RedMileSun">{{cite web|last=Rodriguez|first=Jose|url=http://calsun.canoe.ca/News/Columnists/Rodriguez_Jose/2006/04/14/1534061.html |title=Red Mile reality check|publisher=Calgary Sun|date=2006-04-14|accessdate=2007-12-07}}</ref>

[[Image:Cofred.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The C of Red]]
In April 2006, the [[Calgary Police Service]] announced that Red Mile gatherings would not be encouraged, and that measures would be taken to discourage them, including traffic diversions, a zero-tolerance policy on noise and rowdy behaviour, and the presence of plain-clothed officers among the crowd to ticket offenders.<ref>{{cite web|last=Seskus|first=Tony|coauthors=Sean Myers|url=http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/story.html?id=3ff860fa-18ea-4297-b0f2-f509d7021af9&k=59310 |title=The party's over for the Red Mile|publisher=Calgary Herald|date=2006-04-11|accessdate=2007-12-07}}</ref> After meeting with the Chief of Police, Mayor [[Dave Bronconnier]] convinced the Calgary Police Service to relax their ban on the "Red Mile" and encouraged people to make their way to 17th Ave, however the police retained their zero-tolerance policy on public nudity and drunkenness.<ref name="RedMileSun" />

===The "C of Red"===
During the Flames' run to the Stanley Cup Finals of 2004, most of the Flames fans attending the hockey games at the Saddledome wore a red jersey with Calgary's flaming C on it.<ref name="usatoday" /> Sales of the Flames red home jersey, introduced at the start of the 2003–04 campaign, were so strong during the playoffs that the team set a league record for sales of a new jersey design.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fisher|first=Scott|url=http://www.canoe.ca/Slam040521/nhl_calsj5-sun.html |title=Red-hot jersey breaks record|publisher=Calgary Sun|date=2004-05-21|accessdate=2007-12-06}}</ref>  The tradition of the C of Red dates back to the 1986 Stanley Cup playoffs against the Oilers. Oiler fans were donning hats promoting "Hat Trick Fever" in their quest for [[three-peat|three straight Stanley Cups]]. Flames fans countered by wearing red. In the 1987 playoffs against the [[Winnipeg Jets]], the Jets responded to the C of Red by encouraging fans to wear white, creating the [[Winnipeg White Out]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2007/09/06/nhl_wants_trademark_white_out.aspx |title=NHL wants trademark 'White Out' faded out |date=2007-05-09 |author=Boyer, Lauren |accessdate=2007-09-06 |publisher=The Daily Collegian}}</ref>

==Team colours and mascot==
===Logo===
[[Image:9091Flames sm.gif|right|thumb|160px|Original jerseys, used 1980–1994]]
The Flames primary logo is the "Flaming C" design, introduced when the team came to Calgary in 1980.  The design of the logo has remained constant since it was created, though the Flames use a different coloured logo for the home and away jerseys.  From 1980 until 2000, the home logo was red on a white background, while the road logo was white on a red background.  In 2003, the NHL switched to using coloured jerseys for the home team. The home logo became black, with the road logo red on a white background.  The original "Flaming A" logo of the Atlanta Flames has been restored for use as a patch denoting the team's alternate captains.  The flaming horse logo was retired in 2007 with the introduction of the new [[Reebok|Rbk]] Edge jerseys.<ref name="RbkEdge">{{cite web |url=http://flames.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&page=NewsPage&articleid=336594 |title=Flames unveil new look Rbk Edge uniform |date=2007-09-04 |accessdate=2007-12-07 |publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club}}</ref>

===Jerseys===
[[Image:9596Flames sm.gif|left|thumb|160px|Second design, used 1994–2000]]
The Flames' original jerseys used red and orange striping.  In 1994, the Flames added black to the team's colour scheme, while also adding a diagonal stripe from the base of the jersey to below the logo.  In 1998, to celebrate the "Year of the Cowboy", the Flames introduced their third jersey design, the "flaming horse" logo on a black background.<ref>{{cite book |title=2006–07 Calgary Flames Media Guide |publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club |editor=Hanlon, Peter and Kelso, Sean |pages=pg. 4}}</ref>  Two years later, the jersey became the Flames road jersey, while the home jersey was updated to incorporate the same V-style striping on the arms and waist of the jersey.  This jersey was once again relegated to third jersey status in 2003 when the NHL adopted the coloured jerseys for the home team.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statenews.com/index.php/article/2003/01/nhl_039quacked039_up |title=NHL 'quacked' up with hockey jersey switch |author=Karol, Kristofer |accessdate=2007-12-07 |publisher=statenews.com}}</ref>  In 2007, with the introduction of the Rbk Edge jersey, the Flames updated their look once again, replacing the horizontal striping with vertical striping down the sides.  To honour the team's heritage, the Flames added the flags of Alberta and Canada as shoulder patches.<ref name="RbkEdge" />

''Harvey the Hound'' is the Flames' mascot.

===Honoured members===
{{seealso|Calgary Flames notable players and award winners}}

Several members of the Flames organization have been honoured by the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] during the team's 27-year history in Calgary.  [[Lanny McDonald]] was the first Flame player inducted, gaining election in 1992.  McDonald recorded 215 goals in 492 games for the Flames, including a team record 66 goals in [[1982-83 NHL season|1982–83]].  He was joined in 2000 by a fellow member of the 1989 [[Stanley Cup]] championship team, [[Joe Mullen]].  Mullen spent five seasons with the Flames, recording 388 points and capturing two [[Lady Byng Trophy|Lady Byng Trophies]].  [[Grant Fuhr]], elected in 2003, became the third former Flames player to enter the Hall.  Fuhr played only one season in Calgary; however, he recorded his 400th career win in a Flames uniform, a victory over the [[Florida Panthers]] on October 22, 1999.<ref name="hhof">{{cite book |title=2006–07 Calgary Flames Media Guide |publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club |editor=Hanlon, Peter and Kelso, Sean |pages=pgs. 20–21}}</ref>  In 2007, [[Al MacInnis]] became the fourth former Flame inducted into the Hall.  MacInnis was a member of the Flames from 1981 until 1994.  He is best remembered for his booming slapshot, as well as for winning the Conn Smythe Trophy in 1989 as playoff MVP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/halloffame07/bio?page=nhlhall07/macinnis |title=2007 Hockey Hall of Fame—Al MacInnis bio |author=Burnside, Scott |date=2007-11-09 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2007-12-07}}</ref>

Former head coach "Badger" [[Bob Johnson (ice hockey b. 1931)|Bob Johnson]] joined McDonald in the class of 1992, gaining election as a builder.  Johnson coached five seasons with the Flames from 1982–87, and his 193 wins remain a team record.  [[Cliff Fletcher]] was the Flames general manager from the organizations inception in 1972 until 1991 – a span of 19 years.  During that time, the Flames qualified for the playoffs sixteen consecutive times between 1976 and 1991. Fletcher was inducted in 2004.  In 2006, [[Harley Hotchkiss]] became the third Flames builder to gain election.  Hotchkiss is an original member of the ownership group that purchased and brought the Flames to Calgary in 1980. He has served many years as the chairman of the NHL Board of Directors, during which he played a significant role in the resolution of the [[2004-05 NHL lockout|2004–05 lockout]].<ref name="hhof" />

Flames radio broadcaster [[Peter Maher (hockey announcer)|Peter Maher]] was named the recipient of the [[Foster Hewitt Memorial Award]] in 2006 for his years of service as the radio play-by-play announcer for the Calgary Flames.  During his career, Maher has called Flames games since 1981, six All-Star Games, and four Stanley Cup Finals.<ref name="hhof" />

The Calgary Flames have retired two numbers, and a third was retired league-wide. The Flames have retired [[Lanny McDonald]]'s #9, who played right wing for the Flames from 1981 to 1989, and captaining the Flames in 1989, who won the Stanley Cup.  [[Mike Vernon (ice hockey)|Mike Vernon]]'s #30 is also retired; he was their goaltender for fourteen years, from 1982–94 and 2000–02.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsline.com/nhl/teams/history/CGY |title=Calgary Flames history |publisher=CBS Sportsline |accessdate=2008-01-04}}</ref> [[Wayne Gretzky]]'s #99 was retired league-wide in 2000.
