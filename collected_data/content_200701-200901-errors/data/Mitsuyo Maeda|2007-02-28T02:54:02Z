'''Mitsuyo Maeda''' was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[judoka]], and prize-fighter often referred to as Count Combat (or Conde Koma in [[Brazil]], although he actually adopted the nickname in [[Spain]] during [[1908]]).

==Biography==
Maeda was the teacher of the Gracie brothers and built the foundation for [[Gracie Jiu-Jitsu]] (now universally known as [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]]). He was also a teacher of pioneers of British judo, to include W. E. Steers. He entered the [[Kodokan]] during what was called the "Newaza revolution", during which time [[judo]] became much more heavily ground-oriented due to the recent co-opting of the ground-centric '''Fusen Ryu Jujutsu''' masters into the Kodokan (following successive matches over the Kodokan at their hands).

== Career == 

Maeda was born in [[Hirosaki City]], [[Aomori Prefecture]], in November 1878. As a child, he was known as Hideyo.

In 1896, his parents sent him to Tokyo to attend a prep school associated with [[Waseda University]]. He took up Kodokan judo the following year; his date of membership is June 6, 1897. The chief instructor at the Kodokan in those days was Sakujiro Yokoyama.

By 1903, Maeda had won several judo tournaments and was ranked fourth dan. This got him jobs teaching judo at various Tokyo universities. It also got him selected to accompany judo teacher Tsunejiro Tomita on a trip to the United States in 1904.

Tomita and Maeda sailed from Yokohama on November 16, 1904, and arrived in New York City on December 8, 1904.

During January 1905, the two men gave a judo demonstration at the [[US Military Academy]]. This demonstration was essentially a state visit, as it was attended by Counselor Uchida of the Japanese Legation to the United States.

On February 17, 1905, Tomita and Maeda gave a demonstration at [[Princeton University]]. Maeda threw N.B. Tooker, a Princeton football player, while Tomita threw Mr. Feagles, the Princeton gymnasium instructor. (''Baltimore Sun'', February 18, 1905).

On February 21, 1905, Tomita and Maeda gave another demonstration at the US Military Academy. Tomita and Maeda did [[kata]] -- nage-no, koshiki, ju-no, etc. At the request of the crowd, Maeda wrestled a cadet and threw him easily. But because Tomita had been thrower in the kata, the cadets wanted to wrestle him, too. Tomita threw the first (Charles Daly) without any trouble. However, Tomita twice failed to throw another football player named Tipton using tomoe-nage (stomach throw). Tomita was smaller, so the Japanese claimed a moral victory. (''Baltimore Sun'', February 22, 1905.) The Americans just laughed, and instead hired [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Jenkins_(Wrestler)| Tom Jenkins], a former world champion professional wrestler, to be the Academy wrestling coach.

On March 8, 1905, Tomita and Maeda gave a demonstration at the New York Athletic Club. "Their best throw was a sort of flying cartwheel." Maeda wrestled John Naething, a 200-lb. wrestler.  "Because of the difference in methods the two men rolled about the mat like schoolboys in a rough-and-tumble fight." After fifteen minutes of wresting, Maeda secured the first fall." Naething was awarded the match, however, by pin fall. (''New York Times'', March 9, 1905).

By April 1905, Tomita and Maeda had started a judo club at 1947 Broadway in New York. Most members of this club were Japanese expatriates.

During 1906, Maeda left Tomita to take up professional wrestling. He wrestled first in New York, and then in various Southern states. Reported opponents included John Piening, "The Butcher Boy."

On February 8, 1907, Maeda arrived in [[Liverpool, England]]. From there, he went to [[London, England]], where he lived with another judo man named Akitaro Ono. Ono had gone to the USA in May 1905, as part of a Japanese baseball team. In England, Ono was hired by William Bankier to work as professional wrestler. 

While in Britain, Maeda paid the rent by wrestling professionally. For example, in January 1908, he participated in a tournament at the Alhambra. Maeda was runner-up in the heavyweight division, losing to Austria's Henry Irslinger. 

The following month, Maeda participated in another English wrestling tournament. Again, he ended up runner-up, losing to Jimmy Esson. 

In England, Maeda often gave judo lessons. Students included a man named W.E. Steers. Steers was very enthusiastic about his lessons, even going to Japan to earn 1-dan grading in 1912. In 1918, Steers was one of the first non-Japanese to join the London judo club known as the [[Budokwai]]. Maeda also taught at [[Cambridge University]], where he stayed with a man named Horikiri.

During March 1908, Maeda went to [[Belgium]]. He didn't like Belgium, and soon returned to London.

In May 1908, Maeda participated in a wrestling tournament at Hengler's Circus in London. Maeda and another Japanese, Tano Matsuda, entered as middleweights, and neither man reached the finals. In January 1909, Matsuda became notorious for losing a mixed match to the African American boxer Sam McVey.

Maeda went to [[Spain]] in June 1908. He was accompanied by Fujisake, Ono, and Hirano. While in [[Barcelona]], he had matches with Sadakazu Uyenishi and Taro Miyake. Phoebe Roberts, a Welsh woman who was advertised as the female judo champion of the world, was part of the entourage. Roberts subsequently married Hirano, and stayed in Portugal for the rest of her life.

During this Iberian trip, Maeda adopted the stage name Conde Koma. This was an allusion to Komaru, which in Japanese means "troubled," and was an ironic reference to his always being broke.

In November 1908, Maeda went to [[Paris]] to see his friend Akitaro Ono. From Paris, he went to [[Havana]], arriving there on December 14, 1908. His twice-a-day wrestling act was popular, and he soon arranged for other Japanese to come to Havana, too.

On July 23, 1909, Maeda left Havana for [[Mexico]]. He landed in Mexico on July 27, 1909, and was soon giving shows in [[Mexico City]]. While there, he began working out with another judo man named Satake, who had accompanied the [[sumo]] [[yokozuna]] Hitachiyama to the United States in 1907.

During December 1909, Maeda went back to Havana to participate in a wrestling tournament. His challenge was to throw any contestant in ten minutes, provided they wore jackets. His first opponent was a Frenchman named Auvray, who weighed about 265 pounds, to Maeda's 170. Maeda won in about 4 minutes. His standard throw was ''tomoe-nage'', which the French wrestler, trained in [[Greco-Roman]], did not know. For six nights, he continued the pattern, but then Hjalmar Lundin, who knew [[Cornish wrestling]], surprised the crowd by winning the match. "It was a surprise to the crowd and a set-back for Koma," Lundin wrote in his 1937 memoirs (page 94). "He had been the hero all week, but as soon as he was beaten the fans, true to form, called him a bum." 

Following this tournament, Maeda went to [[Yucatan]]. Unfortunately, there was much unrest in Mexico. Consequently, in July 1910, he returned to Cuba, where he tried to arrange matches with [[Frank Gotch]] and [[Jack Johnson]]. Of course, the Americans ignored him -- there was no money to be made wrestling him, and much money to be lost if they lost to him.

During 1911, Maeda was joined in Cuba by Akitaro Ono, Shinjiro Satake, and Tokugoro Ito. The four men were known as the Four Kings of Cuba. The Four Kings were very popular in Cuba, and Japanese were proud of the reputation they were bringing to judo and Japan (''Japan Times'', November 1, 1912). Consequently, on January 8, 1912, the Kodokan promoted Maeda to fifth degree black belt. There was some resistance to this decision because not everyone in Japan approved of professional wrestling.

During 1913, there was unrest in Cuba, so Maeda went to [[El Salvador]], [[Costa Rica]], and the [[Canal Zone]]. In El Salvador, the president was assassinated while Maeda was there, and in Panama, the Americans often tried to pay him to lose. So, he kept moving south, to end up in Brazil during 1914.

On August 26, 1915, Maeda, Satake, Okura, Shimizu, and Uyenishi were at [[Recife]].  

In October 1915, Maeda was in [[Belém]].

On December 18, 1915, the Four Kings were in [[Manaus]]. Here, the show was at the Politeama Theater, managed by Otávio Pires Jr., and it featured both demonstrations and challenges from the crowd. 

From January 4 to 8, 1916, Maeda organized his own wrestling tournament in Manaus. He did not participate, and Satake was the champion.

After this tournament ended, the Four Kings split up. Ito went to Los Angeles, Satake went to Manaus and then Mexico, and Maeda, Okura, and Shimitsu went to Liverpool.

Maeda returned to Brazil in 1917, where he began working for the Quieirolo Brothers' American Circus. This is probably how he met Gastão Gracie, because during 1916, Gracie was managing an Italian boxer associated with this [[circus]].  

The Quieriolo Brothers' circus went out of business in 1921. At that time, Gracie and Maeda went their separate ways. 

In 1925, Maeda became involved with helping settle Japanese immigrants near Tome-açú, a Japanese-owned company town in [[Pará]], Brazil. This was part of a large tract in the Amazon forest set aside for Japanese settlement by the Brazilian government. The crops grown by the Japanese were not popular with the Brazilians, and the Japanese investors eventually gave up on the project.

Maeda also continued teaching judo, now mostly to the children of Japanese immigrants. Consequently, in 1929, the Kodokan promoted Maeda to sixth dan, and on November 27, 1941, to seventh dan. Maeda never knew of this final promotion, because he died in Belém on November 28, 1941. Cause of death was kidney disease. 

In May 1956, a memorial to Maeda was erected in Hirosaki City, Japan. The dedication ceremony was attended by Risei Kano and Kaichiro Samura.

==Theory of Combat==

Based on his travels competing and training alongside catch-wrestlers, boxers, [[savate]] practitioners and other fighters his travels brought him into contact with, he developed a theory that physical combat could be broken down into distinct phases. In Maeda's mind, it was a smart fighter's task to keep the fight located in the phase of combat that best suited his own strengths. Because Maeda's strength lay primarily in [[grappling]], he put much effort towards finding means to efficiently close the distance between himself and fighters specialized in striking.

==His Influence on the Creation of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu==

Maeda immigrated to [[Belém]], Brazil in the 1910s, where a local influential businessman named Gastão Gracie helped him get established. In return for his aid, Maeda shared his knowledge of martial arts &mdash; which he referred to as jujutsu &mdash; with Gastão's son Carlos, who then passed it on to his brothers, including [[Hélio Gracie]]. Together, the brothers would found the system of grappling known as [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]].

Being small and lacking in physical strength, Helio Gracie was forced to improvise heavily upon Maeda's teachings. Ultimately, this would give rise to what Helio's son, [[Rorion Gracie]], trademarked as [[Gracie Jiu Jitsu]]. However, Carlos and his son, [[Carlson Gracie]] both referred often to Maeda's teachings both on the phases of combat and closing the distance in order to make use of grappling, such that it has become an integral part of their own style of [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]].

It is not clearly known why Maeda chose to call his style of judo, [[Jujutsu]]. One accepted theory states that Judo wasn't so popular at those times and the ancient, general and established term for defining Japanese martial-art schools was Jujutsu (in Brazil it adopted the slightly different spelling Jiu-Jitsu). Judo itself was considered a school of Jujutsu (Kano school, or Kano Ryu), as attests the famous Jujutsu contest between the greatest Kodokan judoka and jujutsu masters all around Japan, held in June 11, 1886 at the Shiba Park's Yayoi shrine. Being just another school of Jujustu, Judo and Jujustu were considered interchangeable terms in the past.

==Legacy==

By sowing the seeds for Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Maeda is arguably one of the most influential judoka of modern times. His accomplishments across the globe as a judoka, catch wrestler, and prize-fighter mark him as one of the early 20th century's most successful mixed martial artists. Furthermore, as a finalist in the world catch-wrestling champions who was reportedly unbeaten in judo bouts, he achieved what must be regarded as a phenomenal balance of success in those two sports. Whether or not another athlete has attained equal or greater accolades in both judo and wrestling is up for debate. Certainly, if such athletes exist, they are few in number.
