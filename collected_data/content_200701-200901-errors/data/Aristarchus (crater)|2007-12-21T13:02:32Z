 eponym=[[Aristarchus of Samos|Aristarchus<br />of Samos]]}}
'''Aristarchus''' is a prominent [[Moon|lunar]] [[impact crater]] that lies in the northwest part of the [[Moon]]'s near side. It is considered the brightest of the large formations on the lunar surface, with an [[albedo]] nearly double that of most lunar features. The feature is bright enough to be visible to the naked eye, and is dazzling in a large [[telescope]]. It is also readily identified when most of the [[lunar surface]] is illuminated by [[planetshine|earthshine]].

The crater is located at the southeastern edge of the Aristarchus plateau, an elevated area that contains a number of volcanic features, such as sinuous [[rilles]]. This area is also noted for the large number of reported [[transient lunar phenomena]], as well as recent emissions of [[radon]] gas as measured by the [[Lunar Prospector]] spacecraft.

Aristarchus was originally named after the Greek astronomer [[Aristarchus of Samos]] by the [[Italy|Italian]]
map maker [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli|Giovanni Riccioli]]. His work ''Almagestum novum'' ("New Almagest"), published in 1651, gave the spot-shaped telescopic features (later called craters) [[eponym]]s of noted astronomers and philosophers. Although widely adopted, the name only became an official international standard by a vote of the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU
General Assembly]] in 1935.<ref>{{cite book | author=M. A. Blagg, K. Müller, W. H. Wesley, S. A. Saunder, J. H. G. Franz | title=Named Lunar Formations | publisher=Percy Lund, Humphries & Co. Ltd. | location=London | year=1935 | url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1935QB595.B6....... }}</ref>


==Selenography==
The Aristarchus crater is located on an elevated rocky rise, known as the Aristarchus plateau, in the midst of the [[Oceanus Procellarum]], a large expanse of lunar [[Lunar mare|mare]]. This is a tilted crustal block, about 200 km across, that rises to a maximum altitude of 2 km above the mare in the southeastern section.<ref name="clementine">{{cite web | url = http://www.lpi.usra.edu/resources/clemen/cmaris.html | title = Aristarchus Region: Multispectral Mosaic of the Aristarchus Crater and Plateau | publisher = Lunar and Planetary Institute | language = English|accessdate = 2006-08-08 }}</ref> Aristarchus crater is just to the east of the [[Herodotus (crater)|Herodotus crater]] and the [[Vallis Schröteri]].

The brightest feature of this crater is the steep central peak. Sections of the interior floor appear relatively level, but [[Lunar Orbiter]] [[photograph]]s reveal the surface is covered in many small hills, streaky gouges, and some minor fractures. The crater has a terraced outer wall covered in a bright blanket of ejecta, which spreads out into bright [[Ray system|ray]]s to the south and south-east. (These suggest that Aristarchus was most likely formed by an oblique impact from the northeast.) Observers have noted that the wall is roughly circular but has a somewhat [[polygon]]al shape.

The main reason for the crater's brightness is that it is a young formation, approximately 450 million years old, and the [[solar wind]] has not yet had time to darken the excavated material by the process of [[space weathering]]. The impact occurred following the creation of the [[Copernicus (lunar crater)|Copernicus crater]], but before the appearance of [[Tycho (crater)|Tycho crater]]. Based on the asymmetrical spread of the ejecta, it was formed by an object that struck at a low angle to the surface, arriving from the north-east.<ref name="clementine" /> The composition of the ejecta includes material from both the plateau and the mare.

To the north of this crater is a system of narrow sinuous [[rille]]s named ''Rimae Aristarchus''. These rilles extend for a distance of 121 km, or three times the diameter of the Aristarchus crater.

==Remote sensing==
In [[1911]], Professor [[Robert Williams Wood|Robert W. Wood]] used [[ultraviolet]] [[photography]] to take images of the crater area. He discovered the plateau had an anomalous appearance in the ultraviolet, and an area to the north appeared to give indications of a [[sulfur]] deposit.<ref name="tlp">{{cite web | last = Darling | first = David O. | url = http://www.ltpresearch.org/aristarchus1.htm | title = Aristarchus: Lunar Transient Phenomenon History | publisher = L.T.P. Research | language = English | accessdate = 2006-08-08 }}</ref> This colorful area is sometimes referred to as "Wood's Spot", an alternate name for the Aristarchus Plateau.

Spectra taken of this crater during the [[Clementine mission]] was used to perform [[mineral]] mapping.<ref name="clementine" /> The data indicated that the central peak is a type of rock called [[anorthosite]], which is a slow-cooling form of [[igneous]] rock composed of [[plagioclase]] [[feldspar]]. By contrast the outer wall is [[troctolite]], a rock composed of equal parts [[plagioclase]] and [[olivine]].

The Aristarchus crater region was part of a [[Hubble space telescope]] study in 2005 that was investigating the presence of [[oxygen]]-rich glassy soils in the form of the mineral [[ilmenite]]. Baseline measurements were made of the [[Apollo 15]] and [[Apollo 17]] landing sites, where the chemistry is known, and these were compared to Aristarchus. The Hubble Advanced Camera for Surveys was used to photograph the crater in visual and [[ultraviolet]] light. The crater was determined to have especially rich concentrations of ilmenite, a [[titanium oxide]] mineral that could potentially be used in the future by a [[Colonization of the Moon|lunar settlement]] for extracting oxygen.<ref>{{cite web | title=Is There Oxygen on the Moon? | work=Time Online |

==Transient lunar phenomenon==
The region of the Aristarchus plateau has been the site of many reported [[transient lunar phenomena]]. Such events include temporary obscurations and colorations of the surface, and catalogues of these show that more than one-third of the most reliable spottings come from this locale.<ref name="c1">{{cite web | url=http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~acc/Lunar/cameron.pdf | last = W. Cameron | title=Analyses of Lunar Transient Phenomena (LTP) Observations from 557–1994 A.D.}}</ref> In 1971 when [[Apollo 15]] passed 110 kilometers above the Aristarchus plateau, a significant rise in [[alpha particle]]s was detected. These particles are believed to be caused by the decay of [[Radon|radon-222]], a [[radioactive]] [[gas]] with a [[half-life]] of only 3.8 days. The [[Lunar Prospector]] mission later confirmed Radon-222 emissions from this crater.<ref>{{cite journal|last = S. Lawson, W. Feldman, D. Lawrence, K. Moore, R. Elphic, and R. Belian | title=Recent outgassing from the lunar surface: the Lunar Prospector alpha particle spectrometer | journal=J. Geophys. Res. | volume = 110 | pages=doi:10.1029/2005JE002433 | date =2005}}</ref> These observations could be explained by either the slow and visually imperceptible diffusion of gas to the surface, or by discrete explosive events.

==Satellite craters==
Surrounding the Aristarchus crater are several smaller craters, many of which are probably '''secondaries'''. Secondary craters form when large blocks ejected from the primary crater reimpact the surface at high velocities. By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing a letter on the side of the crater mid-point that is closest to the primary crater.<ref>{{cite book | author=B. Bussey & P.
