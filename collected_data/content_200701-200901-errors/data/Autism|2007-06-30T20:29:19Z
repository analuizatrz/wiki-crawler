'''Autism''' (also called '''autistic disorder''', '''infantile autism''', '''Kanner's syndrome''' or '''Kanner syndrome''') is a [[neurodevelopmental disorder]] that manifests itself before the age of three years.<ref>{{cite book|chapterurl=http://www.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/?gf80.htm+f840|date=2006|accessdate=2007-06-25|title=International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems|edition=10th ed. ([[ICD-10]])|author=[[World Health Organization]]|chapter=F84. Pervasive developmental disorders}}</ref> Children with autism are marked by impairments in social interaction, impairments in communication, and restricted and repetitive behavior.<ref name="DSM-IV-TR-299.00">{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|edition=4th ed., text revision ([[DSM-IV-TR]])|author=[[American Psychiatric Association]]|date=2000|isbn=0890420254|chapter=Diagnostic criteria for 299.00 Autistic Disorder|chapterurl=http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/autistic.htm|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref> These three characteristics reflect [[Leo Kanner]]'s first reports of autism emphasizing "autistic aloneness" and "insistence on sameness".<ref name="Kanner1943"/>

Autism is one of the five [[pervasive developmental disorder]]s (PDD) or [[autism spectrum disorders]] (ASD), which have no outward physical characteristics. The [[causes of autism]] are not known and are [[Controversies in autism|controversial]]. Genetic risk factors have been confirmed; many environmental risk factors such as exposure to vaccines have been proposed but have not been confirmed by reliable studies.<ref name='Jick'/>

Parents are usually the first to notice symptoms in the first year or two of life, and any warning signs are reason to have a child evaluated by a specialist. Diagnosis is typically based on a complete patient history and physical and [[Neurology|neurological]] evaluation.<ref name='Strock'/> Early intervention is important. Many therapies are available, but very few are supported by scientific studies. [[Applied Behavior Analysis]] has become accepted as an effective treatment for ASD; medications are sometimes also used to treat behavior problems.<ref name='Strock'/> There is no known cure. For severe cases of autism, independent living is unlikely; for milder cases there are some success stories as adults,<ref name='Howlin'/> and an [[Sociological and cultural aspects of autism|autistic culture]] has developed, with some seeking a cure and others believing that autism is simply another way of being.<ref name='Harmon'/>

Estimates of [[prevalence]] vary widely. Most recent reviews estimate a prevalence of 1–2 per 1,000 for autism and close to 6 per 1,000 for ASD. The number of diagnosed autism cases has increased dramatically since the 1980s. Some of this increase is undoubtedly due to better diagnosis, wider public awareness of the condition, and changes in diagnostic criteria. It is debatable whether prevalence has increased as well, as it is hard to quantify diagnostic effects and virtually impossible to prove or disprove changes in risk, given what little is currently known.<ref name="Newschaffer"/>

==Classification==
[[Image:Asperger kl2.jpg|frame|right|[[Hans Asperger]] described a form of ASD in the 1940s that later became known as [[Asperger syndrome]].]]
Autism is a [[developmental disorder]] of the [[central nervous system]]: that is, its onset is invariably during infancy or childhood, its impairments are strongly related to maturation, and it has a steady course without remissions or relapses. It is one of the five [[pervasive developmental disorder]]s (PDD), which are characterized by pervasive abnormalities in social interactions and communication, and by pervasively restricted and repetitive interests and behavior. Of the five PDD forms, [[Asperger syndrome]] is closest to autism; [[Rett syndrome]] and [[childhood disintegrative disorder]] may have causes unrelated to autism but have some autistic-like symptoms; and [[PDD-NOS|pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS)]] is diagnosed when criteria are not met for a more-specific disorder.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Lord C, Cook EH, Leventhal BL ''et al.''|title=Autism spectrum disorders|journal=Neuron|volume=28|issue=2|date=2000|pages=355–63|doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(00)00115-X}}</ref> The main difference between autism and Asperger syndrome is that diagnosis of Asperger's requires there be no clinically significant delay in language development.<ref>{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|edition=4th ed., text revision ([[DSM-IV-TR]])|author=[[American Psychiatric Association]]|date=2000|isbn=0890420254|chapter=Diagnostic criteria for 299.80 Asperger's Disorder (AD)|chapterurl=http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/asperger.htm|accessdate=2007-06-28}}</ref> Another name for PDD is [[autism spectrum disorder]] (ASD); this article uses ''autism'' to refer to the classic austic disorder, which is only one of the five forms, but other sources sometimes use ''autism'' to mean ''ASD''.

Autism covers a wide range, from those who are nearly [[dysfunctional]] and apparently [[Developmental Disability|mentally disabled]] to those whose symptoms are mild or remedied enough to appear unexceptional to others. Sometimes it is divided into "low-functioning autism" (LFA) and "high-functioning autism" (HFA) based on whether [[IQ]] is less than some cutoff figure like 70,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nas.org.uk/nas/jsp/polopoly.jsp?a=3337|title=What is high-functioning autism and Asperger syndrome?|publisher=The National Autistic Society|date=1999|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref> or whether the individual can accomplish activities of daily living. However, these terms are [[Controversies about functioning labels in the autism spectrum|controversial]]. Individuals with Asperger's tend to perform better than those with autism, and it is unclear to what extent Asperger's and HFA represent separate or overlapping conditions.<ref>{{cite book|author=Schopler E, Mesibov GB, Kunce LJ (eds)|title=Asperger syndrome or high-functioning autism?|date=1998|publisher=Springer|isbn=0306457466}}</ref>

Several studies have reported autistic symptoms in some children due to a loss of language or social skills, as opposed to a failure to make progress. Several terms are used for this phenomenon, including [[regressive autism]], setback autism, and developmental stagnation. The validity of this distinction remains controversial, but it is possible such cases represent a specific subtype.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Volkmar F, Chawarska K, Klin A|title=Autism in infancy and early childhood|journal=Annu Rev Psychol|date=2005|volume=56|pages=315–36|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.56.091103.070159|pmid=15709938}}</ref>

==Characteristics==
Autism, unlike disorders such as [[Down syndrome]] and [[Fragile X syndrome]], is not associated with any unusual physical characteristics. Some studies indicate that autistic children tend to have larger head circumferences than those not affected by autism,<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20060209084751/http://www.courchesneautismlab.org/headcircumference.html Head circumference research.]  Courchesne Autism Lab. Retrieved on [[November 13]] [[2006]]</ref>{{check}}<ref>Lainhart JE, Bigler ED, Bocian M, ''et al'' (2006).

PMID 17022081</ref> but the significance of this is unclear.

Individuals diagnosed with autism can vary greatly in skills and behaviors, but their response to sensory input shows marked differences in a number of ways from that of other people. Certain [[stimulation]]s, such as sounds, lights, and touch, will often affect someone with autism differently than someone without, and the degree to which the sensory system is affected can vary greatly from one individual to another.<ref name="NICHDStudy">{{cite press release | url = http://www.nichd.nih.gov/news/releases/autism_affects_brain.cfm |title = Study Provides Evidence That Autism Affects Functioning of Entire Brain-Previous View Held Autism Limited to Communication, Social Behavior, and Reasoning | publisher = [[National Institutes of Health]] | date = [[August 16]] [[2006]] | accessdate = 2007-06-28}}</ref>

===Key behaviors===
Autistic children may display unusual behaviors or fail to display expected behaviors. Normal behaviors may develop at the appropriate age and then disappear or may be delayed and develop after normal occurrence, if at all.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}   In assessing developmental delays, different physicians may not always arrive at the same conclusions. This is often due to the disputed criteria for autism.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ehlers S, Gillberg C |title=The epidemiology of Asperger syndrome. A total population study |journal=Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines |volume=34 |issue=8 |pages=1327–50 |year=1993 |pmid=8294522 |url=http://www.maapservices.org/MAAP_Sub_Find_It_-_Publications_Ehlers_and_Gillberg_Article.htm |accessdate=2007-06-28}}</ref> Practitioners and researchers in [[pediatrics]], [[child psychology]], [[behavior analysis]], and [[child development]] continue to research possible early indicators of autism.

The diagnosis of autism must meet specific criteria, but there are also many characteristics that are idiosyncratic. Autism is not a "one size fits all" label. The [[Autistic spectrum|spectrum disorder]] encompasses a wide range of behaviors and symptoms.

Some behaviors cited by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (listed below) may indicate a normal delay in one or more areas of development, while others are more typical of Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD).<ref name="Filipek">{{cite journal|author=Filipek PA, Accardo PJ, Baranek GT ''et al.''|title=The screening and diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorders|journal=J Autism Dev Disord|date=1999|volume=29|issue=6|pages=439–84|pmid=10638459}} Erratum in: (2000) ''J Autism Dev Disord'' '''30''' (1): 81.</ref>

[[Image:Autistic-sweetiepie-boy-with-ducksinarow.jpg|thumb|200px|A young boy with autism, and the precise line of toys he made]]

===Behaviors in children===

Autistic children are often slow to develop language skills.  Some children with autism meet early developmental milestones, such as babbling or even speaking a few words, and seem to be developing typically until they suffer a regression and lose these skills.  Children with autism often appear to be ignoring the speech of others.  They may fail to react even when they hear their own names spoken.

Certain non-verbal forms of communication can also be difficult for autistic children to learn.  They tend to avoid eye contact, and do not smile when smiled at by others.  The "pointing" gesture is often misunderstood by children with autism.  They tend to stare at the pointing hand rather than looking to see what it is pointing at.

Children with autism tend to avoid playing with other children.  They seem to be "in their own world", staring blankly into space and showing no interest in social interaction.  Rather than playing make-believe games with their toys, many autistic children prefer to arrange these objects into a particular order or pattern.

Repetitive behavior patterns and strict adherence to a particular routine are other signs of autism in children.  A child might spin around in a circle again and again, or insist upon putting on his or her clothes in the exact same order each morning (e.g. first the right sock, then the left sock).  Children with autism may throw intense, violent tantrums when forced to deal with an unfamiliar situation or deviate from their preferred routine.

While some of these behaviors might be seen in a person with autism, others may be absent.<ref name="Filipek"/>

===Social development===
{{Citations missing|section called "Social development"|date=February 2007}}

Typically developing infants respond socially to other people and will look at faces or orient towards voices.  In contrast, most autistic children show little interest in faces and must learn to engage in social interaction. Even in the first few months of life, many autistic children seem indifferent to others, and do not engage in eye contact and interaction with others.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Some infants with autism may appear very calm and may cry less often or fail to seek parental attention.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Other children may develop normally for the first two years of life, but then regress unexpectedly and fail to meet typical developmental milestones.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Davidovitch M, Glick L, Holtzman G, Tirosh E, Safir MP |title=Developmental regression in autism: maternal perception |journal=Journal of autism and developmental disorders |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=113–9 |year=2000 |pmid=10832775 |doi=}}</ref>

Autistic children often seem to prefer being alone.  They may passively accept hugs and cuddling without reciprocating, or resist attention altogether.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} They seldom seek comfort from others or respond to parents' displays of [[anger]] or [[affection]] in a typical way.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Research has suggested that many autistic children do form emotional bonds with their parents. However, this bond may be difficult for others to recognize because an autistic child's particular ways of expressing this attachment may differ from that of other children.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Though social deficits are common, autistic children may vary significantly in their levels of social attachment and interaction. Autistic children usually get on one thing and can't get off of it. For example, if the child or person hears something, they might repeat it for weeks, months, or even years.

According to [[Simon Baron-Cohen]] et al (1985),<ref>{{cite journal |author=Baron-Cohen S, Leslie AM, Frith U |title=Does the autistic child have a "theory of mind"? |journal=Cognition |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=37–46 |year=1985 |pmid=2934210 |url=http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/~aleslie/Baron-Cohen%20Leslie%20&%20Frith%201985.pdf |format = PDF | accessdate=2007-06-28}}</ref> autistic children appear to lack "[[theory of mind]]". Theory of mind refers to an understanding of mental states such as knowing, believing, deceiving or imagining, and tying them together "into a coherent understanding of how mental states and actions are related."<ref> Baron-Cohen, S. (1995). ''Mindblindness: An Essay on Autism and Theory of Mind.'' The MIT Press. p. 51. ISBN 0262023849</ref> This is a behavior cited as being exclusive to human beings above the age of five and possibly, to a lesser degree, to other higher [[primate]]s such as adult [[gorilla]]s, [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzees]] and [[bonobos]].<ref> Baron-Cohen, S. (1995). ''Mindblindness: An Essay on Autism and Theory of Mind''. The MIT Press. p. 125. ISBN 0262023849 </ref> Typical 5-year-olds can develop insights into other people's knowledge, feelings, and intentions based on social cues (e.g., gestures, vocal tone and [[facial expression]]s). An autistic individual may lack these skills, leaving them unable to predict or understand other people's actions or intentions.

Many children with autism experience [[social alienation]] during their school-age years. Many report inventing [[imaginary friend]]s, worlds, or scenarios.<ref>{{cite book|author=Williams, D|title=Nobody Nowhere|publisher=Jessica Kingsley|date=1998|edition=New ed|isbn=1853027189|url=http://www.nobodynowhere.com/|accessdate=2007-06-28}}</ref> Making friends in real life and maintaining those friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism.

It is common for autistics to have difficulty regulating their behavior.  They may cry or engage in verbal outbursts or self-injurious behaviors that seem inappropriate or unprovoked. Those who have autism tend to prefer consistent routines and environments, and often react negatively to changes in their surroundings. Individuals with autism may exhibit poorly modulated behaviors, increased levels of self-stimulatory behavior, self-injury, or extensive withdrawal in unfamiliar or overwhelming situations.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} However, with socialization education and training, many autistic individuals can learn more appropriate means of coping with difficult social circumstances.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

===Sensory system===
Indicators of autism include oversensitivity or under reactivity to touch, movement, sights, or sounds; physical clumsiness or carelessness; poor body awareness; a tendency to be easily distracted; impulsive physical or verbal behavior; an activity level that is unusually high or low; not unwinding or calming oneself; difficulty learning new movements; difficulty in making transitions from one situation to another; social and/or emotional problems; delays in [[Speech delay|speech]], [[Language delay|language]] or [[motor skills]]; specific learning difficulties/delays in academic achievement. However, while most people with autism have some degree of sensory integration difficulty, not every person who has sensory problems is autistic.

Autistic individuals may sometimes also develop obsessions or routines around foods, restricting what is eaten to certain colors, textures or types of food.  Alternatively, they may obsessively avoid certain foods with similar characteristics.<ref>Ahearn WH, Castine T, Nault K, Green G. [http://www.autismtoday.com/articles/Picky_Eaters.htm Autism's picky eaters: an assessment of food acceptance in children with autism or pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified.] Autism Today. Retrieved on [[2007-06-28]].</ref>

An autistic person may have trouble hearing certain people speak, while others are perceived as speaking more loudly than they actually are. An autistic person may be unable to filter out sounds in certain situations, such as in a large crowd of people. Such auditory difficulties fall under auditory processing disorders, and like sensory integration dysfunction, are not necessarily experienced by all people with autism or indicative of a diagnosis of autism.{{Fact|date=March 2007}}

===Autism and blindness===
The characteristics of a person with both an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and a severe visual impairment (VI) may vary from a person with just ASD or just VI.<ref>{{cite web|author=Gense MH, Gense DJ|title=Autism spectrum disorder in learners with blindness/vision impairments|date=2002|url=http://focusfamilies.org/focus/docs/blindnessandautism.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=focusfamilies.org|accessdate=2007-06-26}}</ref> Historically, many behaviors of blind children were seen as "autistic-like" but were attributed to their blindness rather than pursuing possibilities of autism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tsbvi.edu/Education/vmi/autistic-vs-nonautistic.htm|title=Examples of Symptom Presentation in Blind/Autistic Children in Contrast to Blind/Non-Autistic Children a la DSM-IV Criter|accessdate=2007-01-25 | author=Pawletko T, Rocissano L |date=July 2000 | publisher= Texas School for Blind and Visually Impaired}}</ref>

Developmental trajectories of children with ASD-VI are often very similar as those followed by children with typical autism, but the child with ASD-VI will have particularly unusual responses to sensory information. The person may be overly sensitive to touch or sound, or be less responsive to pain. Typically, touch, smell, and sound are affected the most dramatically.<ref name="NIHFactSheet">{{cite web|url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/autism/detail_autism.htm|title=Autism fact sheet|publisher=[[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]]/[[National Institutes of Health]]|date=[[2007-06-27]]|accessdate=2007-06-28}}</ref>

===Communication difficulties===
<!--Move some or all of this section to [[Sociological and cultural aspects of autism]]. -->
{{Citations missing|section called "Communication difficulties"|date=February 2007}}
Some people with autism demonstrate advanced cognitive ability, but lack communicative skills or are not inclined to interact with others socially. An example of this is the noted autistic [[Temple Grandin]], who holds a PhD and is a successful developer of livestock handling technologies. She describes her inability to understand the social communication of neurotypicals as leaving her feeling "like an anthropologist on Mars". Grandin's case was described by neurologist [[Oliver Sacks]] in his 1995 book titled ''[[An Anthropologist on Mars|An Anthropologist on Mars: Seven Paradoxical Tales]]''. Another person with extreme autism is author [[Tito Mukhopadhyay]], one of whose books is ''The Mind Tree''.<ref>[http://magma.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0503/feature1/online_extra.html Mind Tree Poems] National Geographic Magazine OnLine Extra (March 2005). Retrieved on [[February 28]] [[2007]].</ref>

Perhaps due to their difficulties communicating with other humans, some autistics have gravitated toward working with animals. Temple Grandin describes her observations and theories about animals, taken from her work with cattle.<ref>Grandin T, Johnson C (2006). ''Animals In Translation''. Harvest Books.  ISBN 0156031442 </ref> [[Dawn Prince-Hughes]], diagnosed with Asperger's, describes her observations of gorillas in ''Songs of the Gorilla Nation''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Prince-Hughes D|title=Songs of the Gorilla Nation: My Journey Through Autism|date=2004|publisher=Harmony|isbn=1400050588}}</ref>

Some infants who later show signs of autism coo and babble during the first few months of life, but stop soon afterwards. Others may be delayed, developing language as late as the [[adolescence|teenage]] years.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Still, inability to speak does not mean that people with autism are unaware of their surroundings or have no desire to communicate. Some individuals with autism learn [[sign language]], participate in online [[chat room]]s, discussion boards, and [[website]]s, or use communication devices at autism-community social events such as [[Autreat]].

Autistic people often struggle to let others know what they need. They may scream in frustration or resort to grabbing what they want when they are unable to convey their meaning successfully.  Communication difficulties may contribute to autistic people becoming socially anxious or depressed or prone to self-injurious behaviors. Recently, with the awareness that those with autism can have more than one condition, a significant percentage of people with autism are being diagnosed with anxiety and compulsive disorders which may also contribute to behavioral and functioning challenges.

===Repetitive behaviors===
Although people with autism appear physically normal, unusual repetitive motions (known as self-stimulation or "[[stimming]]") may distinguish them from typically developing individuals. Some autisitc individuals repeatedly flap their arms or wiggle their toes, while others will suddenly freeze in position. Some autistic children spend hours arranging objects in a certain way rather than engaging in pretend play as a typical child might, and can become upset and agitated if their work is re-arranged. Repetitive behaviors can also extend into the spoken word, such as [[perseveration]] of a single word or phrase. Some may repeat words from [[movie]]s and watch certain scenes over and over again.<ref name=Crosland>{{cite web|url=http://www.lsi.ku.edu/lsi/internal/seminars/presentations/Crosland_K05-25-01.pdf |format=PDF |title=Prevalence of stereotypy among children diagnosed with autism at a tertiary referral clinic |accessdate=2006-07-01 |last=Crosland |first=K.A. |coauthors=''et al.'' |date=[[2001-05-25]]|work=Presented at the Association for Behavioral Analysis annual conference }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://web1.greatbasin.net/~sprang/stimming.htm |title=Stereotypic (Self-Stimulatory) Behavior (Stimming) |accessdate=2006-07-01 |last=Edelson |first=Stephen M. |date=1995|publisher=greatbasin.net}}</ref>

Children with autism may demand consistency in their environment. A slight change in the timing, format or route of a routine or trip can be extremely disturbing to them.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} People with autism sometimes have persistent, intense preoccupations. For example, the child might be obsessed with learning all about [[computers]], a certain [[television program]], [[lighthouse]]s or virtually any other topic.<ref name="Filipek"/>

===Effects in education===
{{Citations missing|section called "Effects in education"|date=February 2007}}
<!-- Move some or all of this section to [[Sociological and cultural aspects of autism]]. -->
Children with autism are affected by their symptoms every day, which set them apart from unaffected students. Because of problems with [[receptive language]] and [[theory of mind]], they can have difficulty understanding some classroom directions and instruction, along with subtle vocal and facial cues of teachers. This inability to fully decipher the world around them often makes education stressful. Teachers need to be aware of a student's disorder, and ideally should have specific training in autism education, so that they are able to help the student get the best out of his or her classroom experiences.

Some students learn more effectively with visual aids as they are better able to understand material presented visually. Because of this, many teachers create “visual schedules” for their autistic students. This allows students to concretely see what is going on throughout the day, so they know what to prepare for and what activity they will be doing next. Some autistic children have trouble going from one activity to the next, so this visual schedule can help to reduce stress.

Research has shown that working in pairs may be beneficial to autistic children. Autistic students have problems not only with language and communication, but with socialization as well. By facilitating peer interaction, teachers can help their students with autism make friends, which in turn can help them cope with problems or understand the world around them. This can help them to become more integrated into the mainstream environment of the classroom.

A teacher's aide can also be useful to the student. The aide is able to give more elaborate directions that the teacher may not have time to explain to the autistic child and can help the child to stay at an equivalent level to the rest of the class through the special one-on-one instruction. However, some argue that students with one-on-one aides may become overly dependent on the help, thus leading to difficulty with independence later on.

There are many different techniques that teachers can use to assist their students. A teacher needs to become familiar with the child’s disorder to know what will work best with that particular child. Every child is going to be different and teachers have to be able to adjust with every one of them.

Students with autism spectrum disorders sometimes have high levels of [[anxiety]] and stress, particularly in social environments like school. If a student exhibits aggressive or explosive behavior, it is important for educational teams to recognize the impact of stress and anxiety. Preparing students for new situations, such as through writing [[social stories]], can lower anxiety. Teaching social and emotional concepts using systematic teaching approaches such as The Incredible 5-Point Scale or other cognitive behavioral strategies can increase a student's ability to control excessive behavioral reactions.

==Causes==
{{main|Causes of autism}}

The [[etiology]] of autism is complex and controversial, and researchers are studying a wide range of possible genetic and environmental causes.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Trottier G, Srivastava L, Walker CD|title=Etiology of infantile autism: a review of recent advances in genetic and neurobiological research|journal=J Psychiatry Neurosci|date=1999|volume=24|issue=2|pages=103–115|pmid=10212552}}</ref> Genetics are important, since studies of identical twins suggest that the [[heritability of autism]] is high; other possible risk factors include exposure to drugs or vaccines, infection, heavy metals, and gastrointestinal or immune system abnormalities, but the evidence for these risk factors is anecdotal and has not been confirmed by reliable studies.<ref name='Jick'/> Since the way autism manifests is different for each person, there are likely multiple causes that interact with each other in subtle and complex ways, and thus give slightly differing outcomes in each individual. Autism should perhaps not be seen as a single disorder, but rather as a triad of core aspects (social impairment, communication difficulties, and repetitive behaviors) that have distinct causes but often co-occur.<ref name="HappeTime">{{cite journal|author=Happé F, Ronald A, Plomin R|title=Time to give up on a single explanation for autism|journal=Nat Neurosci|date=2006|volume=9|issue=10|pages=1218–20|pmid=17001340|doi=10.1038/nn1770}}</ref>

==Mechanism==
The [[pathophysiology]] of autism is unknown despite extensive investigation. More than 60 disease entities have been shown to be likely causes, including genetic, infectious, [[endocrine]], toxic, and space-occupying factors, suggesting that autism has several genetic and [[neurobiological]] causes.<ref name="emed">{{cite web|author=Hilt RJ|title=Autistic Spectrum Disorders|date=[[2006-04-25]]|publisher=eMedicine|url=http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic3202.htm|accessdate=2007-06-28}}</ref>

===Physiology and neurology===
Autism appears to involve a greater amount of the brain than previously thought.<ref name="NICHDStudy"/> A study of 112 children (56 with autism and 56 without), published in ''Child Neuropsychology'', found those with autism to have more problems with complex tasks, such as tying their shoelaces or writing, which suggests that many areas of the brain are involved.<ref name="Flaw">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4794085.stm “Autism 'affects all of the brain'”] BBC News ([[August 16]] [[2006]]).  Retrieved on [[2007-06-28]].</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Williams DL, Goldstein G, Minshew NJ |title=Neuropsychologic functioning in children with autism: further evidence for disordered complex information-processing |journal=Child neuropsychology : a journal on normal and abnormal development in childhood and adolescence |volume=12 |issue=4-5 |pages=279–98 |year=2006 |pmid=16911973 |doi=10.1080/09297040600681190}}</ref>

Children with autism performed simple tasks as well as or better than those without. In tests of visual and spatial skills, autistic children did well at finding small objects in complex pictures (e.g., finding the character Waldo in "[[Where's Waldo]]" pictures).
However, they found it difficult to tell the difference between similar-looking people. Children with autism tended to do well in spelling and grammar, but found it much more difficult to understand complex speech, such as idioms or similes when the meaning of the phrase is figurative. They would, for example, not understand that "He kicked the bucket" meant someone had died, or were likely to actually hop if told to "hop to it".

The inference from this research, according to researchers at the Pittsburgh School of Medicine, is that "These findings show that you cannot compartmentalize autism. It's much more complex.”<ref name="Flaw"/>

The research from this perspective has a number of implications:
*Autism is more than likely a global disorder which affects how the brain processes the information it receives, while complex information tends to make this more readily apparent.
*Neurological ‘wiring’ in people with autism manifest abnormalities in the areas of the brain that communicate with each other.
*Observed abnormalities provide a reasonable explanation for why children with autism have problems with complex tasks which require multiple areas of the brain to work together; autistic people tend to do better in tasks that only require one region of the brain.
*The causes of autism are possibly more pervasive than previously believed; for example, more areas of the brain are affected than just those involving social interaction, communication, interests, and imagination.
*Autism may not be primarily a disorder of social interaction; research must now take into account non-social aspects.

A possible explanation for the characteristics of the syndrome is a variation in the way the brain itself reacts to sensory input and how parts of the brain then handle the information. An electroencephalographic (EEG) study of 36 adults (half of whom had autism) at the [[University of Washington]] found that adults with autism show differences in the manner in which neural activity is coordinated. The implication seems to be that there is poor internal communication between different areas of the brain. ([[Electroencephalograph]]s, or EEGs, measure the activity of brain cells.)<ref>{{cite journal |author=Murias M, Webb SJ, Greenson J, Dawson G |title=Resting State Cortical Connectivity Reflected in EEG Coherence in Individuals With Autism |journal= Biol Psychiatry|volume= |issue= |pages= |year=2007 |pmid=17336944 |doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2006.11.012}}</ref>

The study indicated that there were abnormal patterns in the way the brain cells were connected in the [[temporal lobe]] of the brain. (The temporal lobe deals with language.) These abnormal patterns would seem to indicate inefficient and inconsistent communication inside the brain of autistic people.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6037836.stm "Clue to flaws in autistic brain".] BBC News ([[October 14]] [[2006]]).

Accompanying impairments are also a common feature of autism. Some people with autism also have [[gastrointestinal]], [[immunological]] or [[neurological]] symptoms in addition to behavioral impairments. These associated complexes have also lead to the search for specific genetic connections and helped to focus on reasonable genetic implications.<ref name = "genelink"/>

Since genes provide the information for processes and structure at the level of the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] and its components during the growth and development of a human as well as maintenance during life, [[gene]] [[mutations]] (altered versions) and deletions (complete absence of genetic material) and possibly extra copies of genes would mean that the causes of autism begin very early. If a mutated gene fails to perform properly, then [[Cell (biology)|cells]], [[proteins]], [[enzymes]] and other crucial aspects of normal function may be significantly altered and operate incorrectly. Deletions could mean the complete absence of a sequence of events due to missing proteins or cell components for example. These genetic alterations and deletions will simply bring about a changed structure or process which effects a great many other needed structures and processes.

Another important aspect of research in genetic factors is environmental effects and the incidence of autism. During the lifetime of a person, gene mutations and deletions may be environmentally triggered or exacerbated. Conversely, it may also be that environment will not be a factor and nothing will change the autism characteristics. For autism, the answer to these possible explanations is still being researched and there is evidence that both may be true simply because there is more than one way a person may develop autism.

====Deletions and mutations====
Deleted genes have been noted as a probable influence or cause in autism.<ref name="YuKindred"/> By locating specific missing genetic material the significance may be that specific genetic sites for autism controlling or causing autism  (autism susceptibility alleles) may be located precisely. Another significant aspect of this research is that these deletions of genetic material indicate that autism may be established in some cases during meiosis (error-prone meiosis model) and this places the genesis of autism in some at the very beginning of life.

One very important question in this line of research is whether or not gene deletions are a cause or consequence of autism-susceptibility [[loci]] located elsewhere in the [[chromosomes]].

Gene mutations may mean a gene does not function at all or does not function in the normal way. Since genes direct how the body grows and develops, mutations, like deletions, will affect a person at the most basic levels.

Mutation and deletion effects have been delineated in numerous research publications.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schuetz G, Rosário M, Grimm J, Boeckers TM, Gundelfinger ED, Birchmeier W |title=The neuronal scaffold protein Shank3 mediates signaling and biological function of the receptor tyrosine kinase Ret in epithelial cells |journal=J.

In typically-developing people, these mirror neurons are thought to perhaps play a major part in [[social learning]] and general comprehension of the actions of others.

==Screening==
Parents are usually the first to notice unusual behaviors in their child: for example, a baby might seem unresponsive to people or might focus intently on one item for long periods of time. Children who seem to have been developing normally might also show signs of autism, for example by becoming silent or indifferent to social overtures.<ref name="Strock">{{cite paper|author=Strock, M|date=2007|title=Autism spectrum disorders (pervasive developmental disorders)|version=NIH-04-5511|publisher=National Institute of Mental Health|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/publicat/autism.cfm|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref> Any of the following warning signs is reason to have a child evaluated by a specialist:
*No babbling by 12 months.
*No gesturing (pointing, waving goodbye, etc.) by 12 months.
*No single words by 16 months.
*No two-word spontaneous phrases (not including [[echolalia]]) by 24 months.
*Any loss of any language or social skills, at any age.
Any delay in evaluation may delay early diagnosis and treatment, and may affect long-term outcome.<ref name="Filipek"/> The National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities recommends that all children be screened for ASD at the 18-, 24-, and 30-month well-child doctor visits, using standard developmental screening tools.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=CDC/National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities|title=Autism Information Center: Screening and Diagnosis|url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/screening.htm|accessdate=2007-06-27|date=[[2007-02-07]]}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
Autism is defined in section 299.00 of [[DSM-IV-TR]] as exhibiting at least six symptoms total, including at least two symptoms of qualitative impairment in social interaction, at least one symptom of qualitative impairment in communication, and at least one symptom of restricted and repetitive behavior. Sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity, stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language, and persistent preoccupation with parts of objects. Onset must be prior to age 3 years, with delays or abnormal functioning in either social interaction, language as used in social communication, or symbolic or imaginative play. The disturbance must not be better accounted for by [[Rett syndrome]] or [[childhood disintegrative disorder]].<ref name="DSM-IV-TR-299.00"/>

Underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases, and much of the recent increase in the number of reported ASD cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices. The increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose ASD, resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms. Conversely, the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Shattuck PT, Grosse SD|title=Issues related to the diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorders|journal=Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev|date=2007|volume=13|issue=2|pages=129–35|pmid=17563895}}</ref>

The symptoms of autism and ASD begin early in childhood but are sometimes missed. High-functioning adults may seek retrospective diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves, to help their employers make adjustments, or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=The National Autistic Society|title=Why get a diagnosis as an adult?|date=2005|url=http://www.nas.org.uk/nas/jsp/polopoly.jsp?a=8018|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref>

==Treatment==
{{main|Autism therapies}}
Early intervention is important. There is no single best treatment, but most children with ASD respond well to highly structured, specialized programs. A broad array of autism therapies have various goals, including improving health and well-being, dealing with emotional problems, overcoming difficulties with communication and learning, and improving sensory awareness. Among these methods, [[Applied Behavior Analysis]] (ABA) has become widely accepted as an effective treatment for ASD.<ref name="Strock"/> A 2005 California study found that early intensive behavior analytic treatment, a form of ABA, was substantially more effective for preschool children with autism than the mixture of methods provided in many programs.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Howard JS, Sparkman CR, Cohen HG, Green G, Stanislaw H |title=A comparison of intensive behavior analytic and eclectic treatments for young children with autism |journal=Research in developmental disabilities |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=359–83 |year=2005 |pmid=15766629 |doi=10.1016/j.ridd.2004.09.005}}</ref>

Medications are sometimes used to treat severe behavioral problems associated with ASD. Many are prescribed [[off-label]], which means they have not been officially approved by the FDA for this use; a child with ASD may not respond in the same way to these medications as typical children.<ref name="Strock"/> An exception is [[risperidone]], which was approved by the FDA in 2006 for the treatment of symptomatic irritability in autistic children and adolescents.<ref>{{cite press release|publisher=FDA|date=[[2006-10-06]]|url=http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2006/NEW01485.html|accessdate=2006-10-02|title=FDA approves the first drug to treat irritability associated with autism, Risperdal}}</ref>

Many other therapies and interventions are available for autistic children, but few if any are supported by scientific studies.<ref name="NIHFactSheet"/><ref>{{cite journal|author=Herbert JD, Sharp IR, Gaudiano BA|title=Separating fact from fiction in the etiology and treatment of autism: a scientific review of the evidence|journal=The Scientific Review of Mental Health Practice|volume=1|issue=1|pages=23–43|year=2002|url=http://www.srmhp.org/0101/autism.html|accessdate=2007-06-28}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
There is no known cure for autism, and there are few high-quality studies on long-term [[prognosis]]. Acquiring language before age 6, having [[IQ]] above 50, and having a marketable skill all predict better outcomes, but independent living is unlikely for severe cases.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Tidmarsh L, Volkmar FR|title=Diagnosis and epidemiology of autism spectrum disorders|journal=Can J Psychiatry|volume=48|issue=8|pages=517–25|date=2003|pmid=14574827|url=http://ww1.cpa-apc.org:8080/Publications/Archives/CJP/2003/september/tidmarsh.asp|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref> A 2004 British followup study of 68 autistic children with IQ above 50 found that 12% achieved a high level of independence as adults, 10% were generally in work but required support, 19% had some independence but needed support and supervision, 46% needed special residential provision and a high level of support, and 12% needed high-level hospital care.<ref name='Howlin'>{{cite journal|author=Howlin P, Goode S, Hutton J ''et al.''|title=Adult outcome for children with autism|journal=J Child Psychol Psychiatry|date=2004|volume=45|issue=2|pages=212–29|pmid=14982237|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.00215.x}}</ref>

The risk of autism is associated with several [[prenatal]] and [[perinatal]] risk factors. A 2007 review of [[risk factors]] found associated parental characteristics that included advanced maternal age, advanced paternal age, and maternal place of birth outside Europe or North America, and also found associated [[obstetric]] conditions that included [[low birth weight]] and [[gestation]] duration, and [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] during [[childbirth]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Kolevzon A, Gross R, Reichenberg A|title=Prenatal and perinatal risk factors for autism|journal=Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med|volume=161|issue=4|date=[[2007]]|pages=326–33|pmid=17404128}}</ref>

Autism is associated with [[mental retardation]]: a 2001 British study of 26 autistic children found about 30% with intelligence in the normal range ([[IQ]] above 70), 50% with mild to moderate retardation, and about 20% with severe to profound retardation (IQ below 35). For ASD other than autism the association is much weaker: the same study reported about 94% of 65 children with [[PDD-NOS]] or [[Asperger's]] had normal intelligence.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Chakrabarti S, [[Eric Fombonne|Fombonne E]]|title=Pervasive developmental disorders in preschool children|journal=JAMA|date=2001|volume=285|issue=24|pages=3093–9|pmid=11427137}}</ref> Boys are at higher risk than girls. The sex ratio is greatly modified by cognitive impairment: it may be close to 2:1 in cases with mental retardation but more than 5.5:1 without. Recent studies have found no association with socioeconomic status, and have reported inconsistent results about associations with race or ethnicity.<ref name="Newschaffer"/>

;Reported increase with time
[[Incidence rate]]s are less useful than prevalence for ASD, as disorders start long before they are diagnosed, and the gap between initiation and diagnosis is influenced by many factors unrelated to risk. Instead, attention is focused mostly on whether prevalence is increasing with time. Earlier prevalence estimates were lower, centering at ~0.5 per 1,000 for autism during the 1960s and 1970s and ~1 per 1,000 in the 1980s, as opposed to today's 1–2 per 1,000.<ref name="Newschaffer"/>

It remains controversial whether some of the increase was real. A real increase would suggest more attention and funding on changing environmental factors, as opposed to continuing to focus on genetics. It is conceivable that some environmental factors may affect people with a specific genetic constitution.

==History==

The [[New Latin]] word ''autismus'' (English translation ''autism'') was coined by the [[Swiss]] psychiatrist [[Eugen Bleuler]] in 1910. He derived it from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''autos'' (αὐτός, meaning ''self''), and used it to mean morbid self-admiration, referring to "autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies, against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance."<ref>{{cite journal|author=Kuhn R, Cahn CH|title=Eugen Bleuler's concepts of psychopathology|journal=History of Psychiatry|volume=15|issue=3|date=2004|pages=361–6|doi=10.1177/0957154X04044603}} The quote is a translation of Bleuler's 1910 original.</ref>

The word ''autism'' took its modern sense in 1943 when [[Leo Kanner]] of the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] reported 11 child patients with striking behavioral similarities and introduced the label ''[[early infantile autism]]''.<ref name="Kanner1943">{{cite journal|author=Kanner, L|title=Autistic disturbances of affective contact|journal=Nervous Child|volume=2|pages=217–50|date=1943|url=http://neurodiversity.com/library_kanner_1943.html|accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref> He suggested ''autism'' to describe the children's lack of interest in other people. Almost every characteristic described in Kanner's first paper on the subject is still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders.<ref name="HappeTime"/>

At the same time, the [[Austria]]n scientist [[Hans Asperger]] made similar observations, although his name has since become attached to a different form of ASD known as [[Asperger syndrome]]. Widespread recognition of Asperger's work was delayed by [[World War II]] in [[Germany]], and by his seminal paper not being translated into English for almost 50 years. The majority of his work was not widely read until 1997.<ref>Kirby, Barbara L.
