The '''Hamlet chicken processing plant fire''' was an [[industrial disaster]] that took place at the Imperial Foods chicken processing plant in [[Hamlet, North Carolina|Hamlet]], [[North Carolina]],  [[United States|USA]] on [[September 3]] [[1991]], after a failure in a faulty modification to a [[hydraulic line]]. Twenty-five people were killed and 54 injured in the [[fire]] as they were trapped behind locked fire doors. Due to a lack of inspectors, the plant had never received a [[safety inspection]] in 11 years of operation,<ref name="emergency.com"/> and it is thought that a single inspection would have easily prevented the incident.<ref name="officialreport"/>

A full [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] investigation was launched, which resulted in the owner receiving a 20-year [[prison]] [[Sentence (law)|sentence]], and the company received the highest [[fine]]s ever handed out in the history of North Carolina.<ref name="fedlock"/> The investigation also highlighted failings in the authoritative enforcement of existing [[safety regulations]], and resulted in a number of worker safety laws being passed. Accusations of [[racism]] were leveled at both the fire service and the city of Hamlet in the aftermath of the fire. The latter dispute, concerning a memorial service organized by the city, resulted in two separate, near-identical monuments being erected. The plant was never reopened.

The fire was North Carolina's worst industrial disaster,<ref name="UnitVII"/> and the third worst American industrial disaster, exceeded only by the 1947 [[Texas City disaster]] and the 1911 [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]].<ref name="lessons"/> (Mining disasters are in a separate category. Fifty-three miners died in 1925 in North Carolina in the [[Coal Glen mine disaster]].)

==Background==
[[Image:Imperial_foods_-_plant_front.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A view of the front of the plant, taken shortly after the fire. The door to the right is the main office.]]

The Imperial Foods building was 11 years old, although the basic structure dated back to the early 1900s.<ref name="officialreport"/> The building had been used for various food processing applications and was previously an [[ice cream]] factory.<ref name="officialreport"/> At the time of the fire it had grown to include a series of adjoining structures totaling {{convert|30000|sqft|sqm|-1|lk=on}}.<ref name="UnitVII">{{cite web |url=http://www.eduref.org/Virtual/Lessons/crossroads/sec4/Unit_7/Unit_VIIQ10R3.html |title=Describe the working conditions in factories in the late 19th century - Imperial Foods Company Reading |accessdate=2007-01-31 |last=Paul Nowell |first=Fred Bayless, |work=eduref.org - Consisting of two articles originally published by the [[Associated Press]] on [[September 5]] [[1991]] and two by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine. }}</ref> The factory was constructed with bricks and metalwork and was one story high.<ref name="officialreport"/> The interior was a "maze of large rooms separated by moveable walls",<ref name="UnitVII"/> and both workers and the product moved around the interior from process to process, going from front to rear.<ref name="UnitVII"/> Imperial's owners usually kept the doors of the chicken plant padlocked and the windows boarded.<ref name="Organica">{{cite web |url=http://www.organicanews.com/news/article.cfm?story_id=103 |title=Hamlet: the Untold Tragedy | year =1995 |accessdate=2007-01-29 |work=Organica News }}</ref> This was done to prevent people from stealing chickens, vandalizing the premises or committing other petty criminal acts. There had been no safety inspections by the state due to a lack of inspectors.<ref name="emergency.com"/> The poultry inspector had visited the site daily and was aware of the various fire violations; one worker has stated that much of the chicken meat was rotten,<ref name="Organica"/> and that the reason it was processed into [[chicken nuggets]] was to disguise the foul taste.

The company always had a poor safety record although it had had no previous fatal accidents. It was cited in the 1980s for safety violations at its [[Moosic, Pennsylvania]] plant. The violations included poorly marked or blocked emergency exits.<ref name="safety record">{{cite news |title=Company in Fatal Fire Cited in Third State |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEEDD1138F935A2575AC0A967958260 |work=The [[The New York Times]] |date=[[1991-09-16]] |accessdate=2007-02-02 }}</ref> The offending factory had been closed by the time of the North Carolina fire.

The Hamlet plant had had three previous non-fatal fires but no action was taken to prevent recurrence or to unlock the doors.<ref name="Organica"/> The plant had been hit by fires before Imperial took over as well, although these, too, were non-fatal.<ref name="officialreport"/> The Imperial plant at [[Cumming, Georgia]] had had two major fires, one of which, in 1989, caused $1.2 million worth of damage.<ref name="safety record"/>

The constant contact with chicken carcasses led to many workers contracting [[psittacosis]], a potentially fatal type of [[zoonotic]] [[pneumonia]], spread to humans by infected [[poultry]].<ref name="WisCOSH">{{cite web |url=http://www.wiscosh.org/work.htm |title=Work : It Can Be dangerous to Your Health |accessdate=2007-02-02 |work=Wisconsin Committee on Occupational Safety and Health }}</ref> There was also a high rate of repetitive motion injuries and an average of 23 percent of workers fell seriously ill or were seriously injured every year.<ref name="WisCOSH"/> It had no [[fire alarm]] system to warn workers further back in the plant, and there were no sprinklers anywhere in the building.<ref name="Organica"/><ref name="no fire alarm">{{cite news |title=Chicken Plant Operators Indicted |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10616FD3A5A0C738DDDAA0894DA494D81 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=[[1992-10-03]] |accessdate=2007-02-02 }}</ref>

An extensive fire was considered unlikely because there was a general lack of flammable materials throughout the complex, other than some packing materials towards the rear.<ref name="officialreport"/> As a result there were open spaces between rooms in place of doors to allow for easy access by [[forklift truck]]s. The only barrier to any of these was curtains of plastic strips between some to hold in refrigerated air.<ref name="officialreport"/> This allowed for rapid spread of smoke and heat in the deadly blaze. Also, the building's previous use as an ice cream production facility meant that the walls and floor were hard, smooth surfaces, which would severely limit the amount of material that was available to absorb heat and smoke during the fire.<ref name="officialreport"/>

==Fire==
[[Image:Imperial_foods_-_cooker_1.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A view of the cooker vat where the fire started.]]
There were 90 employees in the facility at the time of the fire, which began when a 25 [[foot (unit of length)|foot]] (7.6 metre) long [[deep fryer|deep fat fryer]] [[storage tank|vat]] apparently [[spontaneous combustion|spontaneously ignited]] at around 8:30 AM.<ref name="emergency.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.emergency.com/nc-fire.htm |title=Fire Violations Kill Twenty-Five In Chicken Plant |accessdate=2007-01-18 |work=emergency.com }}</ref> This cooker's temperature was controlled by thermostat and was maintained at a constant 375 °F (190 °C), which was variable by design to 15 °F (8.3 °C) either way.<ref name="officialreport"/> The fire spread rapidly, sending workers into a panic so that some suffered trauma injuries during their rush to escape.<ref name="emergency.com"/> Large quantities of smoke were produced by a combination of burning [[soybean oil]] and chicken, and melting roof insulation. The smoke was later found to be [[hydrocarbon]]-charged and therefore had the potential to disable someone within a few breaths.<ref name="officialreport"/> Several gas lines embedded in the ceiling also caught fire and exploded.<ref name="fedlock">{{cite web |url=http://www.fedlock.com/public_relations/Still_Burning.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070405210456/http://www.fedlock.com/public_relations/Still_Burning.htm |archivedate=2007-04-05 |title=Still Burning |accessdate=2007-02-03 |last=Haygood |first=Wil |date=[[2002-11-10]] |work=[[Washington Post]] }}</ref>

Most of those who escaped who were unharmed worked in the front of the building and got out through the unlocked main entrance, but most workers were trapped by a curtain of smoke.<ref name="UnitVII"/> Others tried to escape through the locked doors by kicking them down, but without success; most of the survivors from the rear of the building got out via a loading bay. The bay was originally blocked by a [[tractor-trailer truck|tractor-trailer]], but three workers went into the rear of the truck and pounded on the walls until they were heard by rescuers who moved the vehicle.<ref name="UnitVII"/> Others escaped when several workers managed to break open a few of the doors, though for many this came too late.<ref name="fedlock"/> [[Image:Imperial_foods_-_cooker_2.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The same cooker viewed from further back to give a better view of the general area. Note the heavy damage to the metal roof girders, testimony to the extreme heat of the fire.]] The injured were sent to several different hospitals for treatment for their injuries. One of the deceased worked for an external company and was resupplying the on-site vending machines; no one even realized he was inside the plant until the company he worked for reported his truck missing.<ref name="AFSCME">[http://www.afscme.org/publications/2718.cfm Elements of an Emergency Action Plan] - [[AFSCME]] - Obtained February 6, 2007.</ref>

===Emergency response===
Emergency response was delayed because telephones inside the building could not be used. The plant owner's son drove to the fire station and informed them there that the factory was on fire but neglected to say that workers were still in the plant.<ref name="fedlock"/> More than 100 medical and emergency service personnel attended the scene,<ref name="emergency.com"/> some of whom ran from a local hospital, and nearby towns provided emergency evacuation for the injured via four [[air ambulance]]s from the local hospital to nearby burns units.<ref name="officialreport"/> 

The response later came under heavy criticism. [[Fire Chief]] Fuller, who was in charge of the emergency response, refused help several times from the Dobbins Heights fire department, just five minutes distant. The Dobbins Heights Fire Department was composed of [[African-American]] [[Volunteer fire department|volunteers]] and most of the workers were also black, and there were allegations of racial prejudice from the Fire Chief.<ref name="Organica"/> However, Fuller has defended his decision, saying at the time he refused assistance he did not realize the doors were locked, adding "In a fire like this you need good, seasoned people."<ref name="Organica"/> Witnesses have also said that there were only two oxygen tanks on site to help smoke-inhalation victims.<ref name="Organica"/>

Fuller was asked to evaluate the emergency response for investigators. He said he felt there were "more than adequate numbers of personnel and equipment given the layout of the incident site".<ref name="officialreport"/>

==Reactions==
[[Image:Imperial Floor Plan.png|right|thumb|300px|Floor plan of the factory showing the locations of the origin of the fire and of the killed and injured.]]
It was immediately clear that the workers had been trapped by locked fire doors, which drew much criticism. A spokesman for the company admitted that "certain doors" in the plant were locked at "certain times" but refused to say which doors.<ref name="emergency.com"/> Clark Staten of the Emergency Response and Research Institute in [[Chicago]] said in response to the blaze: "If the initial reports can be believed, this is an intolerable set of circumstances that should result in criminal charges being placed against those responsible for having the fire doors locked... Our past experience with fires and fire deaths shows that we must ensure an adequate number of open exits from any occupied building... It's hard to believe, in today's day and age that any business owner or manager would be so insensitive to fire safety as to allow this sort of incident to happen."<ref name="emergency.com"/>

The Imperial processing facility in Cumming, Georgia was shut down for 24 hours immediately after the fire when a resulting inspection by the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] found an inoperative sprinkler system, "improper" fire exits and no evacuation plan.<ref name="safety record"/> Imperial Foods were told that the plant posed an "imminent danger" to workers because it lacked an automatic fire extinguisher over the cooker similar to the one installed in the Hamlet plant, which failed to prevent the disaster, but did slow the ignition of oil in the vat.<ref name="imminent danger">{{cite news |title=U.S. Tells Poultry Processor Its Plant in Georgia Poses Risks |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20613FE3B540C758CDDA00894D9494D81 |work=The [[New York Times]] |date=[[1991-09-06]] |accessdate=2007-02-02 }}</ref><ref name="officialreport"/>

==Investigation==  
[[Image:Imperial_foods_-_failed_hydraulic_line.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The remains of the failed hydraulic line. Note the separated end connector lying on the bench]]
An investigation was immediately launched by state authorities who were joined one month later by federal colleagues.<ref name="fed. investigators">{{cite news |title=U.S. Agents to Join Carolina Safety Inspectors |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20616FB3E5C0C778EDDA90994D9494D81 |work=The [[New York Times]] |date=[[1991-10-24]] |accessdate=2007-02-02 }} </ref> Investigators found indentations left on at least one door by people attempting to kick it down.<ref name="emergency.com"/> There were concentrations of bodies around [[fire exits]]<ref name="emergency.com"/> and inside a large walk-in freezer where panicked workers had sought shelter. Some sources say they instead quickly froze to death, in temperatures as low as -28 °F (-33&nbsp;°C),<ref name="UnitVII"/> but the official report states they were killed by smoke infiltration around the improperly closed door.<ref name="officialreport"/> Twelve deaths occurred in this area, though five people survived in the freezer, albeit with injuries.<ref name="officialreport"/><ref name="WisCOSH"/> Timothy Bradly, North Carolina's Deputy Commissioner of Insurance, said that technically "There was not a single door in the plant that met the criteria of a fire exit."<ref name="WisCOSH"/>

The fire was caused by failure of a [[hydraulic]] line which powered a [[conveyor belt]] supplying the cooker vat. When the original line developed a leak a worker originally replaced it with new line and with new connections. Later the line, which was too long and created a tripping hazard, was shortened, but in the process the worker replaced the new end connector with the old fitting. 

The line was rated to 3,000 [[Pound-force per square inch|psi]] (20,700&nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|kPa]]), while normal operating pressure never fluctuated higher than 1,500 psi (10,300&nbsp;kPa). However, when the line with a customized connector was brought up to normal operating pressure, it separated from the connector at between 800 and 1,500 psi (5,500&ndash;10,300&nbsp;kPa). [[Hydraulic fluid]] spattered onto the heating plumbs for the cooker and immediately vaporized. This vapor then went directly into the flame of the gas-fired cooker. The vapor had a relatively low [[flashpoint]] and erupted into a fireball. The ruptured hydraulic line went on to pump a total of 50 to 55 [[U.S. customary units#Liquid volume|US gallons]] (41&ndash;46&nbsp;[[Imperial_unit#Measures_of_volume|imp.&nbsp;gal]]/189&ndash;208&nbsp;[[Liter|L]]) of hydraulic fluid into the fire before electrical failure shut it down.<ref name="officialreport">{{cite web |url=http://www.interfire.org/res_file/pdf/Tr-057.pdf |title=Chicken Processing Plant Fires: Hamlet, North Carolina (September 3, 1991) and North Little Rock, Arkansas (June 7, 1991) |accessdate=2007-02-06 |format=PDF |work=[[United States Fire Administration]] report }}</ref>

A state-of-the-art automatic [[carbon dioxide]] [[fire extinguisher]] designed to cope with such fires had been installed over the vat after a non-fatal fire in 1983 at the fire department's request. This prevented the oil itself from igniting until the later stages of the fire.<ref name="UnitVII"/><ref name="WisCOSH"/><ref name="officialreport"/>

Some blame was also laid upon state authorities. The state labor secretary at the time, John Brooks,<!-- Do not wikilink John Brooks; it's not the right person. --> blamed his department's failure to inspect the plant on shortage of money and staff, but also blamed the federal government for not enforcing stricter standards.<ref name="blame on authorities">{{cite news |first=Ronald |last=Smothers |title=North Carolina Examines Inspection Lapses in Fire |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20613FF38580C768CDDA00894D9494D81 |work=The [[New York Times]] |date=[[1991-09-05]] |accessdate=2007-02-02 }} </ref>

===Recommendations===
The final report made ten recommendations. A summary of each point is included below.<ref name="officialreport"/>

*Life safety codes must be enforced. Proper enforcement of existing regulations must occur in future.

*Cooking areas must be separately partitioned from other employee work areas. Cooking operations in food processing plants carry a high risk of fire, and so must be separated from the rest of the building, and from as many workers as possible.

*Building exits in wet-type operations should have double emergency lighting, one positioned above the door and one low to the floor. Because the work areas were cooled to comply with food preservation laws, humidity was high, so-called "wet conditions". These conditions cause particularly heavy smoke, obscuring much high-level emergency lighting.

*High-pressure equipment maintenance and repairs must be limited to factory-trained personnel and specifications. Maintenance personnel working on high-pressure machinery, such as the maintenance employee who conducted the faulty modification to the hydraulic hose in the plant, must be trained by personnel from the factory that supplied the equipment.

*High-pressure equipment in probable incident areas should have built-in catastrophic shutdown valves. This would reduce the probability of accidents in high-risk areas by shutting down machinery should a fault occur.

*[[Negative pressure|Negative air flow]] systems in these facilities could enhance safety by being modified to also accomplish smoke evacuation. Many similar plants have this equipment, which is designed to quickly purge the air of toxic fumes in the event of accidental release of [[ammonia]]. The report recommends modifying the equipment to also pull heavy smoke away from lower areas.

*State and federal inspectors from various departments should be cross-trained. Had the food inspector reported the problems he saw, the disaster may have been prevented despite the lack of other safety inspections. Such personnel should be trained to recognise major problems and to report them to the relevant authorities.

*Establish a “worry free” line of communications for industry employees. Workers inside the Hamlet plant were afraid to say anything about safety conditions for fear of being fired. To overcome such problems, states should establish systems of anonymous reporting of problems by workers.

*The number of OSHA safety inspectors must be increased. The team of inspectors was hugely overburdened at the time of the accident, and the report says that the number of inspectors requires increasing to solve the problem.

*Emergency exit drills must be incorporated into industry policies. This would allow quick evacuation of premises like the Hamlet chicken plant.

==Criminal prosecution==
===Prosecution of the owners===
Emmett J. Roe, owner of Imperial Foods Products Inc.; his son Brad, who was operations manager for the company; and plant manager James N. Hair all surrendered to face prosecution on March 13, 1992, and were charged with non-negligent [[manslaughter]].<ref name="NYT2">{{cite news |title=3 Surrender in Plant Fire |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEFDE1731F930A25750C0A964958260 |work=The [[New York Times]] |date=[[1992-03-13]] |accessdate=2007-01-31 }} </ref> There was no trial.

===Prosecution of Imperial Foods===
Imperial Foods was fined $808,150 for offenses such as the locked doors and inadequate [[emergency light]]ing. The amount is comparatively small compared to [[federal law|federal]] penalties that can total millions because the state administers its own safety program.<ref name="UnitVII"/> It is thought that were the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] responsible the fines would have totaled between $2.8 million and $10 million.<ref name="WisCOSH"/> Despite this, the fine was still the highest in the history of North Carolina.<ref name="fedlock"/>

The disaster and subsequent prosecution have been used as textbook cases in books such as ''Essential Criminology'' (1998, Henry, Stuart; Mark M.

Two separate monuments were erected due to a dispute. Many of the workers and their families wanted [[Jesse Jackson]] to speak in the city's memorial effort. But Mayor Abbie Covington did not want him involved and was backed up by many other local authority figures.<ref name="fedlock"/> The result was that a group of the survivors held their own service which included Jackson. Both services unveiled near-identical monuments, which are situated just 50 yards (46&nbsp;[[metre|m]]) from each other.<ref name="fedlock"/>

Because of the town's small size, many firefighters knew some or all of the victims, and have suffered psychological problems. Fifty to sixty of them attended counseling sessions afterward.<ref name="officialreport"/>

A memorial service was held in 2000, though by then many survivors had died, mostly due to complications from their injuries.<ref name="fedlock"/> The burned-out shell of the factory was bulldozed by the state in 2001 after it was declared "a public health nuisance" due to the [[psychology|psychological]] effects it had on the victims, many of whom still lived within sight of the structure.<ref name="fedlock"/>
