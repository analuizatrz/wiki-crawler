'''Stuart Fergusson Victor Sutcliffe''' (23 June 1940 &ndash; 10 April 1962) was an [[artist]], and the original [[bass guitar|bassist]] of [[The Beatles]] for two years. Sutcliffe earned praise for his [[paintings]], which mostly explored a style related to [[Abstract Expressionism]]. Sutcliffe is one of the group of people sometimes referred to as "the [[fifth Beatle]]".

Sutcliffe and [[John Lennon]] are credited with coming up with the name for the Beatles, as they both liked [[Buddy Holly]]'s band, [[the Crickets]]. Sutcliffe played with the Beatles in [[Hamburg]], where he met [[photographer]] [[Astrid Kirchherr]], to whom he was later engaged. He enrolled in the [[Hamburg College of Art]] after leaving The Beatles, and studied under future [[pop art]]ist [[Eduardo Paolozzi]].

Sutcliffe suffered from debilitating headaches while he was studying in Hamburg, and although tests were carried out by German doctors, no reason could be found for his worsening condition. He died of a brain haemorrhage on the way to hospital in April 1962, with Kirchherr sitting alongside him in the ambulance.

Sutcliffe's father, Charles Sutcliffe, was a [[Navy|naval officer]], who was often at [[sea]] during his son's early years.  His mother, Millie, was a schoolteacher. Sutcliffe had two sisters: Pauline and Joyce.<ref name="NewHamptonStarFasolino">{{cite web |first=Elizabeth |last=Fasolino |url=http://www.easthamptonstar.com/dnn/Arts/Sutcliffe/tabid/4229/Default.aspx |title=Stuart Sutcliffe: Lost Beatle |publisher=[[The East Hampton Star]] |date=[[2007-11-27]]|accessdate=2008-03-03}}</ref>

After talking to Sutcliffe one night at [[The Casbah Coffee Club]], owned by [[Pete Best]]'s mother, [[Mona Best]], Lennon and McCartney persuaded Sutcliffe to buy a [[Höfner]] 500/5 model, known in Europe as a ''President'' bass with the money he had won in the John Moore art exhibition.<ref name=”TheBeatlesAnthologyDVD”> ”The Beatles Anthology” DVD 2003 (Episode 1 - 0:28:02) Harrison and McCartney talking about Sutcliffe’s first bass guitar. </ref><ref>[http://www.rockmine.com/Stu2.html Sutcliffe's President Bass] rockmine.com - Retrieved: 9 May 2007 </ref><ref>[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/mol/exhibitions/sutcliffe/cheque.asp  Sutcliffe's cheque book -] liverpoolmuseums.org.uk  - Retrieved: 13 May 2007 </ref> 

Sutcliffe was somewhat versed in music; he had sung in the local church choir in [[Huyton]], his mother had insisted on piano lessons for him since the age of nine, he had played [[Bugle (instrument)|bugle]] in the [[Air Training Corps]], and his father had taught him a few chords on the guitar.<ref name="Spitzp173"> Spitz (2005) p173</ref><ref>[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/mol/exhibitions/sutcliffe/choir.asp  Photo of Sutcliffe in church choir] liverpoolmuseums.org.uk  - Retrieved: 13 May 2007 </ref> In May 1960, Sutcliffe joined Lennon, McCartney and Harrison (then known as The Silver Beetles).<ref>Coleman, Ray (1984).

[[Allan Williams]] had set up the photograph.

Sutcliffe's playing style was elementary, mostly sticking to [[root note]]s of [[Chord (music)|chords]].<ref name="Spitzp184-185"> Spitz 2005. pp184-185</ref> [[Bill Harry]], an art school friend of Sutcliffe's and the group, and founder and editor of the ''[[Mersey Beat]]'' newspaper, complained to Sutcliffe that he should be concentrating on art and not music, as he thought that Sutcliffe was a competent but not brilliant [[bassist]].<ref name="Spitzp173-174"> Spitz 2005. pp173-174</ref> While Sutcliffe is often described in Beatles biographies as appearing very uncomfortable onstage, and as often playing with his back to the audience, Pete Best denies this, recalling Sutcliffe as usually good-natured and "animated" before an audience.<ref>[http://www.rickresource.com/rrp/petebest.html An Evening With Pete Best, Part I: The Interview] rickresource.com -  Retrieved: 20 Jan, 2007</ref> When The Beatles auditioned for [[Larry Parnes]] at the Wyvern Club, Seel Street, Liverpool, Williams stated that Parnes would have taken the group as the backing band for [[Billy Fury]], but as Sutcliffe turned his back to Parnes throughout the audition &mdash; because, as Williams believed, Sutcliffe couldn't play very well &mdash; Parnes said that he would only employ the group if they got rid of Sutcliffe. Harry has said that the story is not true, as Parnes' only concern was that the group had no permanent drummer.<ref name="HarryBeatleFolks">[http://www.beatlefolks.com/bharry2.shtml Bill Harry interview on Beatle Folks] - Retrieved 28 November 2007 </ref> 

McCartney has said that Sutcliffe was a typical art student, with bad skin and [[Acne vulgaris|pimples]], although in Hamburg, his stature grew after he began wearing dark [[Ray-Ban Wayfarer|Ray-Ban]] sunglasses and tight trousers.<ref name="Milesp65"> Miles 1997 p65</ref> Sutcliffe's high spot was singing "[[Love Me Tender (song)|Love Me Tender]]", which drew more applause than the other Beatles, and increased the friction between him and McCartney. Lennon also started to criticize Sutcliffe, and made jokes about Sutcliffe's size and playing.<ref name="Spitzp242"> Spitz 2005 p242</ref> On 5 December 1960, [[George Harrison]] was sent back to England for being under-age.

[[Image:Sutcliffe and Kirchherr.jpg|thumb|right|250px| Sutcliffe and Kirchherr in 1960.]]
Kirchherr was raised by her [[widowed]] mother, Nielsa Kirchherr, in Eimsbütteler Strasse in the wealthy Hamburg [[suburb]] of [[Altona]].<ref name="Milesp64"> Miles 1997 p64</ref> Sutcliffe met Kirchherr in the Kaiserkeller club, where she went to watch The Beatles perform. After a photo session with them, Kirchherr invited the group to her mother's house for tea and showed them her bedroom, decorated in all black —- including the furniture -— with silver foil on the walls, and a large tree branch hanging from the ceiling. Sutcliffe began dating Kirchherr shortly thereafter.<ref name="Spitzp224"> Spitz 2005. p224</ref>

Sutcliffe wrote to friends that he was infatuated with Kirchherr, and asked her friends which colours, films, books, and painters she liked. Pete Best commented that the beginning of their relationship was, "like one of those fairy stories".<ref name="Spitzp225"> Spitz 2005. p225</ref> Kirchherr and Sutcliffe got engaged in November, 1960, and exchanged rings, as is the German custom.<ref name="Milesp65"> Miles 1997 p65</ref> Sutcliffe wrote to his parents that he was engaged to Kirchherr, something they were shocked to learn, as they assumed he would give up his career as an artist.<ref name="Spitzp235"> Spitz 2005. p235</ref> Kirchherr and Sutcliffe traveled to Liverpool in the summer of 1961, as Kirchherr wanted to meet Sutcliffe's family and to see his home city before their marriage.<ref name="Spitzp278"> Spitz 2005. p278</ref>

==Art==
<!-- Put in-line references into this article from books (with page numbers) or from web pages.  -->
[[Image:Sutcliffe painting.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''Hamburg Painting no. 2'']]Sutcliffe displayed artistic talent at an early age.<ref name="Spitzp105"> Spitz 2005. p105</ref><ref name=" CynthiaJohnp47"> Cynthia Lennon – “John” 2006. p47</ref> Helen Anderson (a fellow student) remembered his early works as being very aggressive, with dark, moody colours, which was not the type of painting she expected from such a quiet student.<ref name="Spitzp107"> Spitz 2005. p107</ref>  

One of Sutcliffe's paintings was shown at the [[Walker Art Gallery]] in Liverpool as part of the [[John Moores (merchant)|John Moores]] exhibition from November 1959 until January 1960. After the exhibition, Moores bought Sutcliffe's canvas for [[£]]75, which was then equal to 6-7 weeks' wages for an average working man.<ref name="Milesp50"> Miles 1997 p50</ref>

After meeting Kirchherr, Sutcliffe decided to leave The Beatles and enrolled at the Hamburg College of Art in June 1961, under the tutelage of Paolozzi, who later wrote a report stating that Sutcliffe was one of his "best students".<ref name="Milesp65"> Miles 1997 p65</ref><ref>[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/mol/exhibitions/sutcliffe/idcard.asp Hamburg identity card, 1961] liverpoolmuseums.org.uk  - Retrieved: 13 May 2007 </ref><ref>[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/mol/exhibitions/sutcliffe/report.asp  Eduardo Paolozzi’s Report] liverpoolmuseums.org.uk  - Retrieved: 13 May 2007 </ref> 

Sutcliffe's few surviving works reveal influence from the British and European [[abstract art]]ists contemporary with the [[Abstract Expressionist]] movement in the United States. His earlier figurative work is reminiscent of the [[kitchen sink realism|kitchen sink school]], particularly of [[John Bratby]], though Sutcliffe was producing abstract work by the end of the 1950s, including ''The Summer Painting'', purchased by Moores. Rod Murray remembered that the painting was painted on a board, not a canvas, and had to be cut into two pieces (because of its size) and hinged. Murray added that only one of the pieces actually got to the exhibition but sold nonetheless.<ref name="Spitzp168"> Spitz 2005. p168</ref>

Sutcliffe's works bear some comparison with those of John Hoyland and [[Nicolas de Staël]], though they are more lyrical. His later works are typically untitled, constructed from heavily impastoed slabs of pigment in the manner of de Staël, and overlaid with scratched or squeezed linear elements creating enclosed spaces. ''Hamburg Painting no. 2'' was purchased by Liverpool's [[Walker Art Gallery]] and is one of a series entitled "''Hamburg''" in which the surface and color changes produced atmospheric energy. European artists (including Paolozzi) were influencing Sutcliffe at the time.<ref>[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/collections/20c/sutcliffe.asp  'Hamburg Painting No. 2' 1961] liverpoolmuseums.org.uk  - Retrieved: 12 May 2007 </ref> The Walker Art Gallery has other works by Sutcliffe, which are "''Self-portrait''" (in charcoal) and "''The Crucifixion''".<ref>[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/mol/exhibitions/sutcliffe/portrait.asp Sutcliffe's self-portrait (in charcoal)] liverpoolmuseums.org.uk  - Retrieved: 13 May 2007 </ref><ref>[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/online/exhibitions/beatles/art/sutcliffecrucifixion.asp “The Crucifixion” by Sutcliffe] liverpoolmuseums.org.uk  - Retrieved: 12 May 2007 </ref>

Lennon later hung a pair of Sutcliffe's paintings in his house ([[Kenwood, St. George's Hill|Kenwood]]) in [[Weybridge]]. McCartney had a Paolozzi sculpture in his Cavendish Avenue home.<ref name="Milesp170"> Miles 1997 p170</ref><ref name="Milesp258"> Miles 1997 p258</ref>

==Death==
<!-- Put in-line references into this article from books (with page numbers) or from web pages.  -->
Stuart Sutcliffe collapsed in the middle of an art class in Hamburg. Nielsa Kirchherr had German doctors perform various tests, but they were unable to determine exactly what was causing the intense headaches from which he had been suffering. While living at the Kirchherrs' house in Hamburg, his condition grew steadily worse. After collapsing again, Sutcliffe was taken to a hospital by Kirchherr (who rode with him in the ambulance), but he died before  reaching the hospital. The cause of death was [[cerebrum|cerebral]] [[paralysis]], after bleeding in the right [[ventricle]] of his [[brain]].<ref name="Spitzp305"> Spitz 2005. p305</ref><ref name="CynthiaJohnp110"> Cynthia Lennon– “John”. p110.</ref>

On 13 April 1962, Kirchherr met The Beatles at the Hamburg airport and told them that Sutcliffe had died from a [[cerebral hemorrhage|brain hemorrhage]] a few days before.<ref name="Spitzp305"> Spitz 2005. p305</ref><ref name="BeatlesTimeline"/> It has never been known precisely what caused the brain hemorrhage that took Sutcliffe's life. Some believe that the cause was an earlier [[head injury]], sustained during a fight outside [[Lathom|Lathom Hall]] after a live performance in January 1961 (although Sutcliffe had been beaten up before).<ref name="Spitzp240"> Spitz 2005. p240</ref> According to former manager [[Allan Williams]], Lennon and Best went to Sutcliffe's aid, fighting off his attackers before dragging him to safety. Sutcliffe sustained a fractured [[skull]] in the fight, and Lennon broke his little finger.<ref name="Spitzp241"> Spitz 2005. p241</ref> 

Sutcliffe had refused medical attention at the time (and had not kept an [[X-ray]] appointment at the Sefton General Hospital).  He saw a doctor only months later in Germany, when he began experiencing severe headaches and acute sensitivity to light.<ref>[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/mol/exhibitions/sutcliffe/letter3.asp  Sefton General Hospital report] liverpoolmuseums.org.uk  - Retrieved: 13 May 2007 </ref> Kirchherr said later that some of the headaches left Sutcliffe temporarily blind.<ref name="Spitzp278"> Spitz 2005. p278</ref><ref name="CynthiaJohnp110"> Cynthia Lennon– “John”. p110.</ref> After Sutcliffe's death, Kirchherr wrote a letter to Millie Sutcliffe, apologising for being too ill to attend his funeral in Liverpool and saying how much she and Lennon missed him: {{cquote | Oh, Mum, he [Lennon] is in a terrible mood now, he just can't believe that darling Stuart never comes back. He just crying his eyes out John is marvellous to me, he says that he know Stuart so much and he love him so much that he can understand me."<ref>[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/mol/exhibitions/sutcliffe/letter4.asp Astrid’s letter to Millie Sutcliffe] liverpoolmuseums.org.uk  - Retrieved: 13 May 2007 </ref>}}

<!-- Put in-line references into this article from books (with page numbers) or from web pages.  -->
The Beatles' compilation album ''[[Anthology 1]]'', consisting mostly of previously unreleased recordings from the band's early years, was released in 1995. Sutcliffe is pictured on the front cover, in the top right corner, as he was on the ''Sgt. Pepper'' album cover 28 years before. He is featured playing bass with the Beatles on three songs that the band recorded in 1960: "Hallelujah, I Love Her So", "[[You'll Be Mine]]", and "[[Cayenne (song)|Cayenne]]".<ref name=”TheBeatlesAnthologyDVD”> ”The Beatles Anthology” 1995</ref>

==Film portrayals==
<!-- Put in-line references into this article from books (with page numbers) or from web pages.  -->
Sutcliffe's role in the Beatles' early career, as well as the factors that led him to leave the group, is dramatised in the film ''[[Backbeat (film)|Backbeat]]'' (1994), in which he was portrayed by [[Stephen Dorff]]. He was also portrayed by David Wilkinson in the film ''[[Birth of the Beatles]]'' (1979) and by Lee Williams in ''In His Life: The John Lennon Story'' (2000).

==Pauline Sutcliffe's memoir==
In 2001, Sutcliffe's younger sister, Pauline (a former [[psychotherapist]]) published a memoir which included claims that Sutcliffe and Lennon had a [[homosexual]] relationship.<ref name="DougThompsonReview">{{cite web |first=Douglas |last=Thompson |url=http://www.dougiethompson.com/pauline-sutcliffe-the-beatles-shadow.htm |title=Douglas Thompson review |publisher=Douglas Thompson |accessdate=2008-03-03}}</ref> She also wrote that the cerebral haemorrhage that Sutcliffe died of was caused by an injury inflicted by Lennon in a jealous rage while in Hamburg.<ref name="IndependentListerReview">{{cite web |first=David |last=Lister |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20011031/ai_n14423599 |title=He helped found the Beatles |publisher=[[The Independent]] |date=[[2001-10-31]]|accessdate=2008-03-03}}</ref> After Sutcliffe died doctors revealed he had an indent in his skull, which must have been the result of some kind of "trauma".<ref name="IndependentListerReviewpage2">{{cite web |first=David |last=Lister |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20011031/ai_n14423599/pg_2 |title=He helped found the Beatles (page 2) |publisher=[[The Independent]] |date=[[2001-10-31]]|accessdate=2008-03-03}}</ref> She claims that a few months before Sutcliffe's death, Lennon had viciously kicked Sutcliffe in the head in an unprovoked attack, as Lennon was bitterly resentful of Sutcliffe's affair with Kirchherr. The book received immense publicity. She moved to the United States in 2002, and settled in [[Wainscott, New York]], and still owns most of Sutcliffe's art work and letters.<ref name="NewHamptonStarFasolino"/>

She said that she did not want to reveal what she believed until after the death of her mother. Among the papers she presented was a letter from Sutcliffe to his mother discussing that both men and women were attracted to him:
{{cquote | I'm waiting for my main meal of the day — beefsteak and mashed potatoes and a glass of milk — this costs 4 marks, every day. [I have just sung] and received the best applause of the night. Moments after I have finished singing, the people all look at me with sad wistful looks on their faces. Recently I've become very popular both with girls and homosexuals, who tell me I'm the sweetest, most beautiful boy. Imagine it, me, the one who has such a complex because I was small and thought I was ugly... It appears that people refer to me as the [[James Dean]] of Hamburg... I'm quite flattered.<ref name="NewHamptonStarFasolino"/>}}

She commented about the media reaction to the two claims in 2007: "I didn't throw out these two themes... They were extrapolated out by the media. I think I'm quite sophisticated, but, boy, was I naive".<ref name="NewHamptonStarFasolino"/>
