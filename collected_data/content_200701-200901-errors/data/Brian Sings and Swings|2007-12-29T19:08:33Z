==Plot==
[[Peter Griffin|Peter]] awakes in the morning to find he has eaten a sheep in his sleep. Undisturbed by the incident, he prepares to leave for work, however hits Brian with the car as he was not looking while reversing. Meanwhile, Meg makes friends with Sarah at her school, unaware that she is about to be offered a place in the Lesbian Alliance Club (LAC). Peter is delighted when Brian is able to return home, but makes too much of an effort to welcome him back into the family. After speaking with [[Neil Goldman]], Meg realises that she is a member of the LAC and prepares to drop out, however, when she realizes the effect of being a member may have on her social status, she pretends to be a lesbian. Meanwhile, Brian becomes depressed after the accident, however, after speaking with Frank Sinatra Jr, he begins to sing along with him on performances, changing his outlook on life to that of positivity.

After being told of Brian's new lifestyles, the family are impressed and encourage him. After being invited by Sinatra to perform with him again, their duo is interrupted by Stewie, who joins the performance. Meanwhile, Meg tells the family that she is now a lesbian, but is mocked by Lois, knowing that she is not being honest. With Sinatra Jr, Brian and Stewie continue their performances across [[Quahog]]. In a drunken condition following on from a performance, Brian loses Stewie, which results in Stewie's ear being bitten off by a deer. Displeased at Brian's behavior, Peter goes to telephone [[Mia Farrow]] (whom he beleives to be Sinatra's mother) to tell her that her son is a bad influence on Brian, however his arm is bitten by Brian, thus making Peter fearful of Brian. Meanwhile.

Brian, regretful of biting Peter, quits from performing with Stewie and Sinatra, resorting to drinking wine from a gutter. However, Brian regains his confidence when Stewie searche for him, where he tells Brian that there are things in life which are beyond his control, telling him that just because things aren't in his control, they do matter, contrary to Brian's common beliefs. Meanwhile, Meg prepares to tell Sarah that she is not a lesbian and that she only pretended to be in order to make friends; however, Sarah gets undressed, believing Meg to have come to her house to [[sexual intercourse|sex]] with her. However, they are both interrupted by [[Glen Quagmire]] and his production team filming their antics.<ref name="Episode">{{cite video|year=2005|title=Plot synopsis information for the episode "Brian Sings and Swings"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

==Production==
Music originally written by [[John Williams]] was used in the episode, however Williams prohibits the usage of his music, so the producers of the show had to re-record it using their own band, however, when the episode aired, Williams insisted that it was his music and it had not been remade by the band, however no further actions was taken against ''Family Guy'' or [[20th Century Fox]].<ref name="MacFarlane">{{cite video | people=MacFarlane, Seth|year=2005|title=Family Guy season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "Brian Sings and Swings"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The synopsis for this episode partially focuces on Meg becoming a [[lesbian]], this was because [[Seth MacFarlane]] believed the United States loved lesbians, which is then described by himself to be "the best kind of love".<ref name="MacFarlane"/> As Brian and Stewie move back and forth on the stage when performing with [[Frank Sinatra Jr.]], the scene originally appeared wrong, as the characters did not match the movement of the background accordingly.<ref name="Moncrief">{{cite video | people=Moncrief, Zac|year=2005|title=Family Guy season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "Brian Sings and Swings"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> When Brian is informing Stewie about his obscure laugh, this is the only time on ''Family Guy'' when MacFarlane has not voiced Stewie; instead, the laughing was performed by [[Ricky Blitt]], a former writer of ''Family Guy''.<ref name="MacFarlane"/>
