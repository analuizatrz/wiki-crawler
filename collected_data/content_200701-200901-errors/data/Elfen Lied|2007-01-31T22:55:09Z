{{Nihongo|'''''Elfen Lied '''''|エルフェンリート|Erufen Rīto}} is the title of a [[Japan]]ese [[manga]] series originally created by [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[mangaka|author]] [[Lynn Okamoto]] as well as a TV [[anime]] series based on it.  ''Elfen Lied'' focuses on a mysterious and deadly breed of horned humans called "[[Diclonius (Elfen Lied)|diclonius]]", and the havoc they wreak upon humanity. The title ''Elfen Lied'' is [[German language|German]] for "Elf Song" (see [[Lied]]), and pronounced approximately {{IPA|[ˈɛlfən liːt]}}, although the correct German spelling would be "Elfenlied". 

''Elfen Lied'' first began as a [[manga]] series, serialized in the magazine ''[[Weekly Young Jump]]'' and published in Japan by [[Shueisha]], ending at the completion of the twelfth volume. An [[anime]] adaptation began airing in Japan on [[July 25]] [[2004]] while the unfinished manga was still in production, causing the anime plot to differ somewhat from the manga. A bonus [[OVA]] episode was released on [[April 21]] [[2005]] giving some more [[back-story|background]] information. 

So far, only the original anime series spanning 13 episodes and the OVA have been licensed in the [[United States]], by [[ADV Films]]. ADV Films said the series was one of their bestselling <ref>{{cite news |last=Solomon |first=Charles |title=Mean Girls |date=[[July 17]] [[2005]] |publisher=New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/17/arts/television/17solo.html?ex=1145419200&en=f50bd37485179e26&ei=5070}}</ref> and "most notorious" <ref>{{cite press release | publisher = ADV Films | date = [[September 28]] [[2005]] | title = Great Reason To Give Thanks With Nine New Releases November 15th | url =http://www.advfilms.com/GEN_PRDetails.asp?ID=1724 }}</ref> releases of 2005. ''Elfen Lied'' and the character Nana were the inspiration for the popular [[Clone Manga]] fan-[[webcomic]] "Nana's Everyday Life" which has been completed and fully translated from English into 6 other languages. <ref>{{cite web | title = Nana's Everyday Life | publisher = Clone Manga | url = http://manga.clone-army.org/nana.php | accessdate = 2006-08-21}}</ref>

==Plot==
{{spoilers}}
The story begins with a naked young girl named Lucy escaping under odd circumstances from an insular [[research]] facility off the coast of [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]] in the [[Kanagawa Prefecture]] of Japan. Lucy manages to nonchalantly dismember and slay 14 (23 in the anime) of the staff and guards with some form of seemingly [[supernatural]] power and gets outside. A [[sniper]] is seen trying to shoot her, only managing to ricochet a bullet off her metal helmet. Lucy then falls off a cliff into the sea, bleeding from her head but ultimately surviving and evading the research staff.
[[Image:Elfen Lied ep2 Vectors.jpg|right|250px|thumb|A diclonius' "vectors" take the form of long translucent or invisible arms.]]
Lucy is not a normal human but rather a [[Diclonius (Elfen Lied)|diclonius]]: a [[mutant]] variant of humans with two small horns on their heads that resemble cat ears (hence the name diclonius). The diclonius race possesses [[Telekinesis|telekinetic]] powers through use of their "vectors", invisible arms that they control with a number and length of reach depending on the diclonius.

The day after Lucy's escape, a boy named Kohta arrives at Kamakura to meet his [[cousin]] Yuka. Kohta has come to study at the local [[university]] and has been given lodging at an old, family-owned [[Ryokan (inn)|inn]], the "{{Nihongo|Maple|楓|''kaede''}} Inn", provided he acts as the [[caretaker]]. After meeting with Yuka, they go to visit the beach and find Lucy washed up on the shore, still naked and bleeding from her head. The head [[Physical trauma|trauma]] Lucy experienced causes her to develop a [[Dissociative identity disorder|split personality]], "Nyū". In stark contrast to the cold and sadistic Lucy, Nyū is completely docile, harmless and is incapable at first of saying anything other than "Nyū". Not knowing what to do with her, Kohta and Yuka take her back to the inn to look after her. Yuka quickly decides that it will be best that she also live at the inn.

Kohta, Nyū, and Yuka begin settling into their life at the inn and Nyū begins to dredge up painful repressed memories from Kohta's past. Meanwhile, the researchers from the laboratory where Lucy was held begin searching for her, dispatching both human and diclonius agents to hunt her down. 

==Main characters==
{{main|Characters of Elfen Lied}}
[[Image:Kouta.png|left|100px|Kohta]]
{{Nihongo|'''Kouta'''|コウタ|Kōta, officially romanized as ''Kouta''}} is around 19 years old and enters the story when his cousin's family allows him a to move in to their closed down inn in exchange for maintenance while he goes to a local [[university]]. Kouta has [[repressed memory|repressed]] [[Psychological trauma|traumatic]] [[memory|memories]] of his father's and sister's deaths during his childhood at Lucy's hands. Because of his repressing his memories, Kouta does not remember Lucy from when he met her earlier as a child. Due in part to his loss, he has a soft spot for girls in trouble and is extremely generous and protective to the girls around him.

{{anime voices|Chihiro Suzuki|Adam Conlon}}
{{-}}
[[Image:Yuka.png|right|100px]]
{{Nihongo|'''Yuka'''|ユカ}} is Kouta's [[cousin]]<ref>Elfen Lied Ep. 1: Yuka greets Kouta and then says "''Yuka desu... Itoko no...''"「ユカです…従姉妹の…」, which quite unambiguously translates as "I'm Yuka. Your cousin."</ref>. She is also around 19 years old and planning to attend the same university as Kouta. She moves in with him at the [[inn]] after having not seen him in many years. Having had a crush on Kouta since childhood, she is in love with him<ref>Yuka's relationship with Kouta may be considered [[taboo]] or illegally [[Incest|incestuous]] by [[United States|U.S.]] viewers, but relationships between cousins is not considered scandalous in [[Japan]] and is a topic seen regularly in anime. See: ''[http://www.animenation.net/news/askjohn.php?id=1373 Why is Romance Between Cousins Common in Anime?]''</ref>, and is therefore jealous of Kouta's attention to Nyū, to the point of being very irrational.
{{anime voices|Mamiko Noto|Nancy Novotny}}

[[Image:Evil Lucy.png|left|100px|Lucy]]
{{Nihongo|'''Lucy'''|ルーシー |Rūshī}} is a [[teenage]] diclonius girl around 18 years old, Lucy has four vectors with a limited range of two meters. <ref>Note: These restrictions on Lucy's vectors are not present in the manga.</ref> However, she can be swift and lethal within that range, and will use any nearby objects as high velocity [[projectile]]s to kill at greater distances. She is also capable of stopping or deflecting most standard ammunition when she concentrates on the task. Lucy hates humans mainly because of how she was treated by her human peers as a child. Consequently, she discounts non-diclonius, claiming they are not real people. She seems to lack [[empathy]], kills without much concern, and acts somewhat sadistically.
{{-}}
[[Image:Nyu.png|right|100px|Nyü]]
{{Nihongo|'''Nyū'''|にゅう}} is a [[dissociative identity disorder|split personality]] of Lucy that developed after an [[anti-tank rifle]] round ricocheted off a metallic helmet encasing her head. Nyū has a childlike [[personality]] and infantile knowledge of the world, and lacks spoken [[language]] skills. Nyū is innocent and incapable of violent acts, a [[Foil (literature)|foil]] to the normal Lucy; she is the manifestation of her "good side". When Nyū is attacked violently (or hit on the head), she regresses into Lucy; likewise, when Lucy is treated with love and kindness, she will uncontrollably switch back into Nyū.

==Cultural references==
===Art===
The opening and ending sequences feature artistic drawings of the principal characters. These characters are drawn in a style based on [[Gustav Klimt]]'s paintings, imitating poses, colors, and patterns. In the following comparison images, the left side of each image shows Klimt's work, and on the right, Elfen Lied's counterpart:

|-
| align="center" | '''''The Embrace'''''
| align="center" | '''''[[The Kiss (Klimt painting)|The Kiss]]'''''
|}

===Music and poetry===
The [[Germany|German]] [[Lied|song]] ''[[Elfenlied]]'' ("Elf Song") appears in the manga (volume 5, p.154) and is credited to the composer [[Hugo Wolf]]. A poem by [[Eduard Mörike]] is the basis for Wolf’s version. The song does not appear in the anime, it is taught to Nyū by the manga-only character [[List of Elfen Lied characters#Minor characters|Nozomi]]. 

==Adaptations==
[[Image:ElfenLied_manga_page.jpg|thumb|200px|Lucy having an aggressive outburst toward Kohta and Mayu. Lucy has far more vectors in the manga than in the anime.]]
===Manga===
The complete manga series runs for 107 chapters spanning over 12 volumes.
{{spoilers}}
Compared to its anime adaptation, the approach and depth of information presented by the manga involving the diclonius race differs greatly. The diclonius virus is explained in greater detail with moments such as Professor Kakuzawa explaining the half-diclonius status and [[ancestry]] of his family to Lucy before she kills him. The diclonus characters are shown to be more diverse with Lucy/Nyū having pink hair, Mariko being blond, and Nana having dark purple hair. The diclonius in general are shown to be able to control a far greater number of vectors. Silpelit diclonius are shown to age two to three times faster than normal humans and naturally born diclonius, like Lucy. 

Some characters are seen in greater detail in the manga. Mariko, for instance, has her psychological issues and past trauma more thoroughly explained. She also develops a split personality called Myū which possesses almost identical traits to Nyū. However, unlike Nyū, Myū can and will both consciously and willingly switch back to Mariko, if she feels any potential threat putting in danger the lives of her beloved ones or more specifically her father, Kurama.

Characters were introduced in the manga that were otherwise completely omitted from the anime series. An example of this early on in the manga is an acquaintance of Yuka's, referred to as "Nozomi-chan." These differences are subtle and do not alter the story of the anime too much from the manga. Similarly, the [[music box]] playing the "Lilium" melody that is featured in the anime does not appear in the manga.

====Side stories====
The manga also features several [[side story|side stories]] from previous works done by [[Lynn Okamoto]]. These stories came included with the release of certain volumes of the manga and, therefore, can be considered bonus material (not related to Elfen Lied) for avid fans of the manga to collect.
* ''MOL'' - featured in volume 1
* ''Digitopolis'' - featured in volume 2
* ''Memoria'' - featured in volume 3
* ''Carrera'' - featured in volume 5

In addition, volume 8 includes two other stories that form part of the Elfen Lied universe.
{{spoilers}}
* ''NOZOMI'' is the first side story featured, and explains Nozomi's past and why she chooses to move into the Kaede Inn. This tale is in canon with the continuity of the main storyline.
* The second side story that follows after NOZOMI involves the whole residents at the Kaede Inn throwing a party and indulging themselves in excessive drinking. Nana and Mayu fall asleep, allowing both Yuka and Nyū to release their inhibitions and deliver an intimate [[fan service]] to Kohta. Unfortunately, their fun is suddenly brought to an end when Nyū without warning switches back to Lucy who seems rather upset, ending the story with a [[cliffhanger]]. This tale is not canon for Elfen Lied's overall plot.

Elfen Lied has been described as similar to, or borrowing elements from ''[[Chobits]]'', ''[[3x3 Eyes]]''<ref name="scifi"/> and ''[[Gunslinger Girl]]''<ref name="shelf"/>.

====Format====
{{main|List of Elfen Lied episodes}}
The [[television]] series ran for 13 episodes and adapted approximately the first 60 out of 107 chapters of the manga. Episodes 1 to 11 of the anime are in [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] with the [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] of the storyline for volumes 1 to 6 of the manga, faithfully adapting most of the events happening in the latter. The last two TV episodes strayed from the manga's continuity and gave an original conclusion to the anime. The series' author, [[Lynn Okamoto]], has a brief [[cameo appearance]] as a special guest in episode 12.

Elfen Lied first aired on [[TV Tokyo]]'s AT-X satellite channel from [[July 25]] [[2004]] to [[October 17]] [[2004]] and was broadcast again in 2005. The anime was licensed by [[ADV Films]] in the [[United States]] in [[2004]] and was released on [[DVD]] in [[2005]]. A single 24 minute [[Original Video Animation|OVA]] episode was also released. It takes place between episodes 10 and 11 of the original TV series, and for that reason, some refer to it as ''episode 10.5'', ''OVA special'', or even as ''episode 14''. The special itself takes on a lighter tone and answers some questions of the early episodes rather than advancing the plot. During the ''Anime Boston 2006''<ref>{{cite web | title=Anime Boston 2006 - A.D. Vision | publisher=Anime News Network |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/convention.php?id=317 | accessdate=2006-06-05}}</ref> (May 26—28) [[Anime convention|convention]], ADV Films acquired the distribution rights of the OVA for release in the [[United States]].

====Theme songs====

==Societal topics==
Throughout its course, the story of Elfen Lied delves into moral dilemmas and societal issues both real and hypothetical, contrasting the reactions of the different characters and races to horrific circumstances, especially those from their childhoods.

{{spoiler}}
===Evolution===
Elfen Lied deals with [[human evolution]] with both humans and the diclonius regarding each other as expendable, dehumanized mistakes. However, an important aspect of the series involves relationships between primary caregivers, as well as love in general, which is gradually revealed to exist between the diclonius and humans. The main drive of the diclonius race is the propagation of their superior traits through the destruction of the human race. This homicidal drive can arise as early as the 3rd year of a diclonius's life. Many diclonius do not consider normal ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' "human"; this apparently stems from their very distinctive characteristics that in turn caused them to be rejected by fellow humans.

===Humanity===
[[Image:Elfen Lied Ep 8 Lucy.png|right|thumb|Young Lucy lashes out violently at her tormentors.]]
One of the most prevalent motifs of the series is the humanity of the diclonius, especially contrasted against the inhumanity of ordinary people. One reviewer described the series as "devoted to quite a few of the darker, more callous factors of human nature"<ref name="them1"/>. Throughout the series, incidences of human [[Sadism and Masochism|sadism]] are seen, from casual beatings to [[paedophilia|pedophilic]] [[rape]] to outright killing. 

Lucy begins life as a perfectly psychologically normal child, with an obvious physical difference, and is [[Bullying|bullied]] and tormented repeatedly by ordinary people. Although she tries to make friends with children her own age, she is spurned, lied to, physically [[assault]]ed, and forced to witness brutality. She suffers a great deal because of her day to day life, and so her reactions vary between disgust at the casual cruelty, painful wonder about why she alone is so mistreated, wishing to retreat from her miserable life, and desire to wreak [[Revenge|vengeance]] in the most painful way possible on her tormentors (the human race).

===Trauma===
The story also deals with the issues of [[psychological trauma]] and [[repressed memory|repressed memories]]. Different characters are shown exhibiting [[dissociative identity disorder]] and [[dissociative amnesia]], being mistreated as a test subjects in cruel experiments at the research facility and one character (Mariko) is shown as having been locked up, immobile for her entire life in a containment chamber, her only contact with anyone being a voice though a speaker.
