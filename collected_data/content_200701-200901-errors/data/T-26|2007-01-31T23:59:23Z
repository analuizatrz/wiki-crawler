The '''T-26''' was a [[tank|light tank]] used by the [[Soviet Union]] from the [[1930s]] until [[World War II]]. It was based on the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Vickers 6-Ton]] tank, widely considered one of the most successful designs of the 1930s.<ref>Franco, ''El Tanque de la Guerra Civil Española'', p. 74</ref>

The T-26 made-up the majority of the [[Red Army]]'s armour force until late 1941, and would see a long history in the armed forces of different nations around the world. For almost a decade the T-26 proved to be one of the best tanks in production, with a total of around 12,000 units produced.<ref>Candil, p. 34</ref> Success and failure in the [[Spanish Civil War]], where it would be the most widely used tank, would ultimately play a major role in influencing the Soviet doctrine of tank warfare in the late 1930s; later in its service the T-26's obsolescence contributed to some of the major Soviet defeats during the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]] in 1941. 

Although the T-26's reputation would be marred by its abysmal performance during the [[World War II|Second World War]], it was nevertheless the most important tank of the [[Spanish Civil War]] and played major roles during the [[Winter War]] and the [[Battle of Khalkhin Gol]] in 1939.  Between its introduction and its retirement, the T-26 would see a great deal of modernization efforts between 1932 and 1941.

==Design==
By 1933, the Red Army fielded at least six different types of tanks to fulfill Deputy Commissar for Defence [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]]'s view of mechanization for his theory of [[deep operations]].  These models included the T-26 for [[Infantry tank|armour attachments]] to infantry divisions, the [[BT tank|BT-5]] for [[Cavalry tank|mechanized cavalry]], the [[T-35]] as a heavy breakthrough tank and the [[T-37]]/[[T-38]] as an [[Amphibious vehicle|amphibious]] [[reconnaissance]] vehicle.<ref>Candil (1999), p. 34 ''See also:'' House, "Towards Combined Arms Warfare"</ref>  By 1940, the T-26 would be the most widely produced of all these tanks, with over 12,000 units rolling off the production lines.

The T-26 was designed to replace the obsolescent [[T-18 tank|T-18]], also called MS-1. It was designed in 1929, when several Soviet military officials travelled to Western Europe to choose a new tank model for indigenous production and upgrading.<ref>Finegold (2006)</ref>  Originally, the Soviet Experimental Design department ([[OKMO]]) would attempt to produce two "pirated" prototypes of the [[Vickers Six-Ton]]—the T-19 and T-20—<ref>Miller, p. 216</ref> but neither prototype fulfilled the Red Army's role for the tank, and therefore the Soviets opted to simply purchase the production license.<ref>García, p. 319</ref>  In 1931, production of the T-26A, a copy of the Vickers Six-Ton, began after acquiring the production license.<ref>Franco (2006), p. 74.  Baryaktinskiy, p. 21 for information on production factories. Production was to originally begin at the Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant and later continue in the new Stalingrad factory.</ref> However, the Soviets did not intend to simply replicate the Vickers Six-Ton.<ref>Baryaktinskiy, p. 20</ref>

[[image:T26 11.jpg|right|thumb|305px|T-26 Model 1931 twin-turreted machine gun tank]]

Like its British counterpart, the T-26A had a twin-[[Gun turret|turret]] configuration and was designed to carry two machine guns—one in each turret. The major difference between the Soviet T-26A and the British Six-Ton were the rectangular firing ports for [[Degtyarev light machine gun|Degtyarev machine guns]], as opposed to the round ports used by the original design.<ref>Baryaktinskiy, p. 24</ref> After problems experienced with precipitation and snow getting into the engine compartment, a special bonnet was installed after March 1932, and was later made integral with the design of the air intake unit. The tank was also fitted with higher turrets with an observation post, while the driver was given a vision port.<ref>Ibid. p. 24</ref> Around 1,627 tanks with twin turrets were produced between 1931 and 1933, and 450 were armed with the 37&nbsp;mm PS-1.<ref>Ibid. p. 27</ref>  However, in 1933 the Soviets unveiled the T-26B, with a single cylindrical turret which carried a single 37&nbsp;mm cannon and a single [[7.62 mm caliber|7.62 mm]] machine gun.<ref>Franco, p. 74</ref>  Ultimately, this 37&nbsp;mm primary cannon was replaced by the more well-known 45&nbsp;mm, which was based on the [[Germany|German]] Pak 35/36 cannon acquired in 1930.<ref>Franco, p. 74</ref>  The 45&nbsp;mm gun would see some evolution, as the original 45&nbsp;mm 19K anti-tank gun<ref>Redesignated the 20K with the whole assembly</ref>, developed at Plant No. 8, in 1935 by the 45&nbsp;mm model 1934, which saw the semi-automatic mechanism replaced by an inertial operating mechanism.<ref>Baryaktinskiy, p. 29</ref>  The T-26 could carry up to three secondary Degtyarev 7.62&nbsp;mm machine guns, in coaxial, rear, and antiaircraft mounts.  The majority of T-26 built were of the T-26B model, otherwise known as the T-26 Model 1933. The original purpose of the upgraded firepower was to increase lethal range to defeat dedicated anti-tank teams, as the original machinegun ordnance was found insufficient.<ref>Baryaktinskiy, p. 25</ref>

The T-26B carried 122 pieces of hand-loaded 45&nbsp;mm ammunition, firing armour-piercing 45&nbsp;mm rounds with a muzzle velocity of 820&nbsp;m/s, or lower-velocity high-explosive munitions.<ref>Candil, p. 34</ref> The tank was powered by a GAZ 91 horsepower gasoline engine which gave it a top speed of almost 30&nbsp;km/h.  The hull had a maximum steel thickness of 16&nbsp;mm, which proved enough to stop light machine gun ammunition, including German 7.92&nbsp;mm armour-piercing rounds. The hull armour, however, would later prove to be too light against newer German anti-tank weapons in 1941.  There would be subsequent attempts to thicken the front plate, but ultimately the T-26 would end production in favour of newer and superior tank designs, such as the [[T-34]].  In 1937 there was an effort to equip many tanks with anti-aircraft machineguns, as well as the addition of two searchlights, a new VKU-3 command system and a TPU-3 interphone. The T-26 was also given an improved carrying capacity, from 122 rounds to 147 for the main gun.<ref>Baryaktinskiy, p. 30-31</ref> In 1938 the cylindrical turret was replaced with a conical shaped turret, with the same 45&nbsp;mm model 1934 gun.<ref>Ibid. p. 31</ref>

Between 1931 and 1940 over 12,000 T-26s were produced, the majority of these being the T-26B.  Even by 1940, the T-26 continued to be the backbone of the Red Army's mechanization efforts, which would prove nearly fatal to the Red Army during the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941.  The T-26, however, saw a rich and valuable service during the [[Spanish Civil War]].

The first shipment of T-26Bs to Spain was conducted on [[October 15]], [[1936]], at the Spanish port city of [[Cartagena]] which was occupied by the [[Popular Front]] at the time. It was to be one of the first of many shipments to Spain covered by the term Operation X which would be the Soviet Union's stream of aid to the Spanish Republic's cause.  This first shipment, provided by the Soviet ship ''Komsomol'' provided 50 new T-26Bs to Spain under the command of General Krivoshein.  This would ultimately spark German aid to Franco and the first shipment of [[Panzer I]]s would arrive only weeks later.  Both tanks would see their first combat during the Nationalist advance towards Madrid and during the [[Siege of Madrid]] proper.  Ultimately, the Soviet Union would provide a total of 281 T-26Bs, half of which would fall into Nationalist hands by the end of the war and form the crux of the Spanish Brunete armoured division until [[1953]].<ref>García, p. 320.  Some Soviet sources state that a total of 312 T-26Bs were provided to Spain.  These sources include at least 16 [[FT-17]] light tanks and at least 15 T-26Bs which never made it to Spain.</ref>  Additionally, the Soviets would provide over 50 [[BT-5]] fast tanks.

Krivoshein only had ten days to prepare his armour for the defence of Madrid.  On [[October 26]] he was ordered to put at least some of his tanks to defend the Spanish capital from the nationalist advance.  Unfortunately, Krivoshein's force only numbered 15 tanks and was crewed by poorly trained Republican militia.<ref>Daley (1999), p. 33</ref>  The Republic's new armour was put under the command of Spanish Captain Paul Arman and it was used immediately in a counterstroke dedicated against the town of Torrejon de Velasco.  Although the offensive saw initial success against the unprepared Nationalist infantry poor communications influenced Arman's tanks to separate themselves from the supporting infantry provided by Colonel Enrique Lister's infantry brigade, allowing Nationalist infantry to knock out at least one T-26 and force the rest to withdraw under severe pressure with the help of one of the nationalist legion's cavalry brigade.  Furthermore, while the T-26s exploited the breakthrough Lister's infantry continued to fight around the village of Seseña, making further infantry support impossibly in any case.  Republican armour would suffer from similar problems throughout the war, ultimately shaping [[STAVKA]]'s and [[Stalin]]'s view of the tank in war.

Stalin also inadvertently became the largest provider to the Nationalist armoured forces.  Due to the superiority of the Soviet T-26 over both the Italian [[CV-33]]/35 and the German [[Panzer I]] the Nationalist front would put many captured T-26s into service, using them against their previous masters.  During the Republican offensive towards Torrejon three T-26s were captured, and a few days later another four were captured as well.  By the end of the Siege of Madrid there would be enough captured T-26s to create an ad hoc armoured battalion.  By the end of [[1937]] the Nationalist front had created and equipped a battalion of engineers solely responsible for the capture of Soviet armour, especially the T-26, and by the end of the war 178 T-26Bs would be captured by [[Francisco Franco]]'s Nationalist forces. Of these, 30 were so damaged that they could not be used (although they would be scavenged for their parts) and another 50 which were captured by different bodies of the Nationalist armies and not utilized.<ref>García, p. 328</ref>  The T-26 would remain the backbone of the Spanish armoured forces until the beginning of American aid in [[1953]].

The presence of the T-26 during the Spanish Civil War would also spark several interesting developments within the context of tank design and anti-tank tactics.  The most widely known development would be that of the [[Molotov cocktail]], a bottle of explosive fluid with a cloth fuse designed to splash against the hull of a tank to achieve a mobility kill.  One of the most interesting Nationalist responses, however, would be the Breda upgrade on the Panzer I.  This was the attempt to fit a 20 mm Breda anti-air machine gun in a modified Panzer I turret to achieve penetration of the thickest part of the T-26B's frontal armour.  Only four Panzer I 'Bredas' were built and the project would ultimately be cancelled due to the sheer number of captured T-26Bs and their reformation into Nationalist armoured units.  There would also be less known upgrade plans to fit both Soviet 37&nbsp;mm anti-tank guns on the Panzer I and Soviet 45&nbsp;mm guns (scavenged from captured unusable T-26Bs), which is a testament to the killing power of the 45 mm gun against Nationalist light tanks.<ref>Franco, Panzer I, pp. 47–50.  Covers information dealing with the Breda upgrade and the failed attempts to mount the much larger 37&nbsp;mm and 4&nbsp; mm guns</ref>  Given the lack of information on the latter upgrade attempts it's possible to deduct that both projects never got off the drawing board.

Despite the T-26's success in the Spanish Civil War, the fact that it performed badly within the context of tank operations, its days were numbered and it would fatally influence post-Spanish Civil War Soviet military thinking.  It would also prove to be ineffectual against more advanced anti-tank weapons and better-armed tanks.

=== Comparing tanks ===
Of the three major tanks which saw action during the Spanish Civil War the T-26 proved itself superior to both the Panzer I and the CV-33.  The T-26 was the only tank equipped with an actual cannon, as opposed to a machine gun, and although heavier, was no less manoeuvrable than its enemies.  The T-26 was also deployed in greater numbers than the Panzer I and CV-33 combined.  The Italians would ultimately equip Nationalist Spain with 155 CV-33s in 9 shipments between August 26 1936 and December 1938.<ref>García, p. 314</ref>  The Germans would provide a total of 122 Panzer Is in 5 shipments.  On the other hand, Moscow provided 281 T-26Bs to the Spanish Republic by 1938, although many of these would fall into the Nationalist's hands.  Below is a comparison of the different tanks used during the Spanish Civil War.

Perhaps the single largest advantage the T-26B had over the Panzer I and CV-33/35 was the 45&nbsp;mm cannon.  Although Panzer Is were able to perforate the T-26B's front armour plate during the first clashes of the Spanish Civil War using armour piercing 7.92 mm ammunition, it was only able to do this at under 150&nbsp;m.  Republican and Soviet tank crews countered this by engaging at ranges of up to 1,000&nbsp;m.<ref>Candil, p. 36</ref>  This advantage in engagement range outweighed the fact that all tanks had similar protection levels at their thickest point, and the Italian and German tanks had slightly better mobility.  It allowed the T-26B unrestricted dominance during the Spanish Civil War.  The relatively high power of the 45&nbsp;mm gun was one of the reasons Spanish nationalist engineers attempted to upgrade the gun of the Panzer I, (although, as stated, this would prove ultimately unsuccessful).  The power of the Soviet 45 mm gun was matched by the accuracy of the gun sights, which allowed for engagement ranges of 3,000 m.<ref>Candil, p. 36</ref>  Nationalist anti-tank gunners using the Pak 37 could not accurately hit at beyond 900&nbsp;m, and although the Spanish did use the German 88&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft cannon in the anti-tank role, which would make the gun infamous during the Second World, they were not supplied in large enough numbers to make an impact.<ref>Candil, p. 36</ref>

== Inter-war years and the Second World War==
In 1938 the T-26B would see an additional upgrade to the C version which had its front armour plate thickened to 25&nbsp;mm of steel.  This still proved to be insufficient against better anti-tank weapons, and the tank would be upgraded one more time.  This time it would manifest itself as the T-26S and would be completed after the T-26 had done rather poorly against Japanese light tanks during the undeclared war between [[Japan]] and the Soviet Union in [[Mongolia]].  After the Spanish Civil War the T-26 was used in large numbers during the Soviet-Finnish [[Winter War]] in [[1939]].  The poorly coordinated Soviet offensive would end in large numbers of the tanks utilized being knocked out by Finnish anti-tank weapons and more than 40 captured. Even more T-26 tanks would be captured during the offensive phase of the [[Continuation War]]. The Finns also rearmed their Vickers 6-Ton tanks with the Soviet 45&nbsp;mm gun and these would be re-designated as T-26Es and would be used during the Continuation War. 75 T-26s and 19 rebuilt Vickers tanks were used after the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]].<ref>Muikku, p. 191</ref>  Fortunately for the Soviet Union, the debacle in Finland would persuade them to reassess the value of armour in an offensive war.  Unfortunately for the Soviets, it would make public gashing weaknesses in the Red Army.  These weaknesses would not be corrected until after the catastrophic losses of 1941 against invading German armour.

[[Image:T26 parola 7.jpg|right|thumb|305px|Inside a T-26 turret, looking forward at the gun breech.]]

Prior to the Second World War the T-26 would see one last successful encounter against Japanese tanks at Khalkin Gol, under the command of Soviet General [[Georgi Zhukov]].  Zhukov's offensive included 469 light tanks, most of which were T-26s.  Infantry during the offensive [[tank desant|rode on the hulls]] of armour and armoured cars various times to reduce the time it took to close with the enemy, which aided in co-operation between armour and infantry.<ref>House, p. 69</ref>  Although the offensive against Japanese forces infiltrating Mongolia proved to be a sudden success within the stream of Soviet military failures in [[Poland]] and [[Finland]], it became apparent that the T-26 was obsolete against newer tanks, including the Japanese [[Type 97 Chi-Ha]] and even the older [[Type 89 Chi-Ro]].<ref>House, p. 69</ref>  One of the largest faults of the tank was the riveted armour, which was found to be too weak to protect against direct hits.  This would be corrected on the T-26S variant which replaced the riveted front plate with a thicker welded plate.<ref> WWII Vehicles.com. [http://www.wwiivehicles.com/ussr/tanks_light/t26.html T-26 Light Tank]</ref>  The T-26S had an increase in armour thickness from 16&nbsp;mm to a maximum of 25&nbsp;mm at 55 degrees on the upper [[glacis]] plate.  The turret featured in increase to 20&nbsp;mm at 45 degrees sloping.<ref>[http://www.irvania.com/downloads/TBOTRus1.pdf Book of Tanks: Russian/Soviet (pdf)]</ref>  Unlike the T-26B in Spain, the T-26S used a maximum of two machine guns, one of which was mounted in the rear.<ref>[http://www.irvania.com/downloads/TBOTRus1.pdf Book of Tanks: Russian/Soviet (pdf)]</ref>

The [[Great Purge|1937 purges]] of the [[Red Army]] claimed the life of General [[Tukhachevsky]], one of the most important theorists of armoured warfare of the inter-war period.  With no major proponents of Tukhachevsky's theories alive or willing to speak, previous advances were thrown out.  Based on observations from the Spanish Civil War it was decided that armour was too unwieldy to successfully interact and operate with infantry.  Tanks moved too quickly for the infantry to accompany, and there was no clear communications doctrine between tanks and infantry.  Furthermore, some infantry refused to accompany tanks and there was no clear training of Spanish soldiers to correct these tactical inefficiencies.  Republican tanks frequently fell to anti-tank gunnery, due to the lack of infantry support, as there was no infantry to locate and knock out enemy anti-tank positions that were hidden from the armour.<ref>Zaloga, [http://libraryautomation.com/nymas/soviet_tank_operations_in_the_sp.htm"Soviet Tank Operations"]</ref>  Republican tanks rarely operated on the move in Spain since the radios often broke down, and the majority of tanks simply didn't have radios.  Due to the difficulties encountered, many old-school Soviet military leaders believed that tanks were not a worthwhile weapon of war, and so the role of the tank was played down considerably.  One of the most fatal decisions was to curtail production of the T-34, which would lead to too few advanced tanks present during the German invasion.<ref>Glantz and House,''When Titans Clashed'', p. 36</ref>

It was only after the German success in Poland and the Soviet stumbling in the same country, as well as the Soviet debacle in Finland, that [[Stavka]] and Stalin were persuaded to reintroduce the T-34 into production to replace the obsolete T-26 and other light tanks, and to reform large mechanized formations.<ref>House, p. 68-69</ref>  It would prove to be too little, too late.  Not everything between [[April 1]], [[1939]], and [[June 22]], [[1941]], was negative however.  A commission under the leadership of Soviet General [[Grigory Kulik]] oversaw a new reorganization of the Soviet armoured force.<ref>Ibid., p. 69</ref>  Perhaps driven by the obstacles faced by the Red Army in Poland, the Red Army's armour corps was reorganized in December 1939.  It was found that the large mechanized corps which had been proposed by Tukhachevsky proved to be unwieldy and hard to coordinate due to the sheer bulk of armour.<ref>Ibid., p. 38-39</ref>  Nonetheless, the commission emphasized using armour for infantry support, as opposed to using them in stand-alone armoured divisions.  Therefore, Kulik planned for fifteen new motorized divisions to replace the Soviet mechanized corps.  By 1940, four of the fifteen had been created.<ref>Ibid., p. 69</ref>

However, impressed by the German campaign of 1940 against France, the Soviet [[NKO]] ordered the creation of nine mechanized corps on July 6, 1940.  Between February and March 1941 another twenty would be ordered, and all larger than those of Tukhachevsky. Although, on paper, by 1941 the Red Army's 29 mechanized corps had no less than 29,899 tanks it proved to be a paper tiger.<ref>House, p. 96</ref>  There were actually only 17,000 tanks available at the time, meaning several of the new mechanized corps were under-strength, and the sheer majority of these were obsolete designs, including over 10,000 T-26 tanks.<ref>Baryaktinskiy, p. 35</ref>  By [[June 22]], [[1941]] there were only 1,475 T-34s and KV series tanks available to the Red Army, and these were too dispersed along the front to provide enough mass for even local success.<ref>House, p. 96</ref>  To put this into perspective, the 3rd Mechanized Corps in Lithuania was formed up of a total of 460 tanks, 109 of these were newer KV-1s and T-34s.  This division would prove to be one of the lucky few with a substantial number of newer tanks.  However, the 4th Army was composed of 520 tanks, all of which were the obsolete T-26, as opposed to the authorized strength of 1,031 newer medium tanks.<ref>Glantz, pg.35</ref>  This problem was universal throughout the Red Army's available armour.  This fact would play a crucial role in the defeat of the Red Army in 1941 at the hands of the German Armed Forces.<ref>Glantz, Stumbling Colossus, p. 117</ref>

=== Second World War === 
The T-26 formed the backbone of the Red Army's tank force during the first months of the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]] during the Second World War.  The Red Army was equipped with 10,268 T-26 tanks of all models on [[June 1]], [[1941]]<ref>Baryaktinskiy, p. 35</ref>.  This and the lack of coordination between different units of the Red Army influenced a very poor performance of the Red Army against the Germans between June and August 1941.  Even in instances where Soviet commanders showed initiative, such as Soviet General [[Kirponos]] counterstroke in the Southwest, Soviet forces were simply not coordinated enough to stall the German advance, nor were their tanks comparable to the newer generation of German armour, such as the [[Panzer III]] and [[Panzer IV]].<ref>Glantz and House, p. 54</ref>  By the end of fighting along the central axis in August 1941, in preparation for the end of German operations around [[Kiev]] and [[Leningrad]], the majority of the Red Army's armour had been destroyed or captured.  Although the Germans also fielded various obsolete designs, such as the Panzer I and [[Panzer II]], their heavier armour was packed together to provide enough mass to punch through Soviet front lines and exploit any breakthroughs achieved.  In instances where Soviet heavy and medium armour was available the German offensive was many times stalled.  For instance, a Soviet counterattack in front of [[Raseiniai]], Lithuania, on [[June 24]], [[1941]], was able to overrun an advance reconnaissance detachment of the [[German 6th Panzer Division]], forcing the divergence of the [[1st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|1st Panzer Division]] and stalling the offensive for a day.<ref>Raus, p. 34, Zaloga & Grandsen (1981), pp. 10–12</ref>  By the end of the year the T-26 had been reverted to other duties, including logistics, and began to be used as a chassis for new tank surrogates.

Nevertheless, despite the fact that the majority of the Red Army's T-26 tanks had been destroyed in the first months of the war with the Third Reich, T-26 tanks would see combat around [[Leningrad]] until at least 1944.  There would also be T-26 tanks present during Operation [[August Storm]], the Soviet invasion of [[Manchuria]] in March 1945.  In this operation the T-26 tank would help defeat the [[Japan|Japanese]] [[Kwantung Army]].<ref>Information dealing with combat operations of the T-26 after 1941 is reviewed briefly in Baryatinskiy, p. 35</ref>

Many T-26s were captured by the Germans during the offensive.  Most of the captured tanks were captured without serious damage, which is a testament to existent mechanical problems within the tank.  Under German usage the T-26 was found to have severe clutch problems, a hot steering apparatus and seized bearings.  Several T-26Bs were used by the [[3rd SS Division Totenkopf|German 3rd SS Panzer Division "Totenkopf"]] as renamed ''Mistbiene'' tanks, or 'manure bees'.  The T-26B, redesignated as the T-26B 738(r.) was used extensively by the German Army.  Many T-26Cs were also used on the [[Eastern Front]] during the war by the Germans.  Several T-26s of all versions were abandoned by their new German owners due to severe mechanical defects, as explained above.  Many light tanks were used as tractors to carry Pak guns and artillery guns.  There were instances where German T-26s were used to support infantry operations as well—these were renamed the T-26 C740(r).<ref>For information dealing with captured Soviet tanks used by the German Army see: Regenberg, pp. 4–10</ref>

There would be several replacement programs for the T-26 throughout the Second World War.  The original replacement light tank would be the [[T-50]], adopted for the Red Army in February 1941.  Despite the fact that mass production was to start in the Leningrad Plant No. 174 on [[January 1]], [[1941]] the sophisticated T-50 saw several production problems.  Ultimately 50 T-50 tanks were assembled in Leningrad prior to the plant's removal and movement to Omsk in August 1941.  Efforts to renew production in Moscow failed, although Plant No. 174 in Omsk managed to produce another 15 tanks before production was switched to T-34s only.<ref>Baryatinskiy, p. 68-70</ref>  The T-50's production failure at Moscow Plant No. 37 led to the design of the [[T-60]] light tank, an austere version of the T-50 heavily based on the [[T-40]] amphibious tank.  Between July 1941 and early 1943, 5,839 T-60s were delivered to the Red Army, of which 5,796 were accepted into active service.<ref>Ibid., p. 72-84</ref>  Yet another replacement was manifested as the [[T-70]] tank which saw its beginnings in October 1941 as a project of the GAZ plant design bureau.  The T-70 was largely based on the T-60 to keep the two as similar as possible.  Later, the T-70 would see a modernization effort, known as the T-70M.  8,226 T-70s of all types would be contructed.<ref>Ibid., p. 85-95</ref>  The final replacement light tank was known as the [[T-80 light tank]] which was a new manifestation of the T-70 with a thickened armor plate and a three-man crew.  Eighty-five T-80s were produced between late 1942 and early 1943.<ref>Ibid., p. 95</ref>

As noted above, 94 T-26 tanks remained in service with the Finnish Army by 1945. The highest number was during the summer of 1944, when the Finns kept up to 126 various T-26s, including 22 T-26Es, 2 T-26 m 1931s, 1 OT-26, 63 T-26 m 1933s, 32 T-26 m 1937s and 1939s, and 1 T-26 T.<ref>Muikku, p. 191</ref> Some of these tanks were kept as training tanks until 1959, when they were finally phased out and replaced by newer British and Soviet tanks.

Additionally, Franco's Spain kept captured T-26Bs as the backbone of the new Spanish armoured division, the Brunete.  After the end of the Spanish Civil War, Spain received additional T-26 tanks from France which had been taken from retreating Popular forces and interned in French warehouses.  In 1942 the Spanish Army had 139 T-26Bs in service.<ref>García, p. 328</ref>  After the end of the Second World War Spain had at least 116 T-26Bs on front line service, along with 20 Panzer IVs, 93 Panzer Is, 60 CV-33s and another 80 assorted machine gun carriers.<ref>García and Franco, "La Brunete", p. 31</ref>  The T-26s were organized into two battalions of 30 tanks each, along with a single Panzer I command tank, six other Panzer I Ausf. As and a CV-33 for reconnaissance in each battalion.  The T-26 would not be replaced until 1953 when Spain and the United States signed an agreement for open shipments of new military matériel to Spain.  The first twelve [[M47 Patton]] tanks, dedicated to replace the T-26, would arrive at Cartagena in February 1954.<ref>Manrique and Franco, ''La Brunete: Primera Parte'', p. 31</ref>

At least 60 T-26 light tanks were sold to Turkey in the 1930s and around 82 to China.  An unknown amount were sold to Afghanistan during the same time period.<ref>Baryatinskiy, p. 35</ref>
