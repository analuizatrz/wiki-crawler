'''Copper(II) acetate''', also referred to as '''cupric acetate''', is the [[chemical compound]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] [[Cu]]<sub>2</sub>(OAc)<sub>4</sub> where AcO<sup>-</sup> is [[acetate]] (CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>).  The [[hydrated]] derivative, which contains one molecule of water for each Cu atom, is available commercially.  Cu<sub>2</sub>(OAc)<sub>4</sub> is a dark green [[crystalline]] solid, whereas Cu<sub>2</sub>(OAc)<sub>4</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub> is more bluish-green.  Since ancient times, copper acetates of some form have been used as [[fungicide]]s and green [[pigment]]s.  Today, Cu<sub>2</sub>(OAc)<sub>4</sub> is used as a source of copper(II) in inorganic synthesis and as a [[catalyst]] or an [[oxidizing agent]] in [[organic synthesis]]. Copper acetate, like all copper compounds, emits a blue-green glow in a flame.

==History==
Copper(II) acetate is the primary component of [[verdigris]],{{Fact|date=June 2007}} the blue-green substance that forms on copper during long exposures to atmosphere.  It was historically prepared in vineyards, since [[acetic acid]] is a byproduct of [[Fermentation (food)|fermentation]].   Copper sheets were alternately layered with fermented grape skins and [[dregs]] left over from wine production and exposed to air.  This would leave a blue substance on the outside of the sheet.  This was then scraped off and dissolved in water.  The resulting solid was used as a pigment, or combined with [[arsenic trioxide]] to form [[copper acetoarsenite]], a powerful [[insecticide]] and fungicide called [[Paris Green|Paris]] or Schweinfurt green.

==Uses in chemical synthesis==
The uses for copper(II) acetate are more plentiful as a catalyst or [[oxidizing agent]] in organic syntheses.  For example, Cu<sub>2</sub>(OAc)<sub>4</sub> is used to couple two terminal [[alkynes]] to make a 1,3-[[diyne]]:<ref>P. Vogel, J. Srogl "Copper(II) Acetate" in "EROS Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis" Copper(II) Acetate, 2005 John Wiley & Sons.</ref>
:Cu<sub>2</sub>(OAc)<sub>4</sub>  +  2 RC≡CH  →  2 CuOAc  +  RC≡C-C≡CR  +  2 HOAc
The reaction proceeds via the intermediacy of [[copper(I) acetylide]]s, which are then oxidized by the copper(II) acetate, releasing the acetylide radical.  A related reaction involving copper acetylides is the synthesis of [[ynamines]], terminal alkynes with amine groups using Cu<sub>2</sub>(OAc)<sub>4</sub>.<sup>[2]</sup>

==Structure==
[[Image:Copper(II)-acetate-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|200px|The dinuclear structure of copper(II) acetate]]
Cu<sub>2</sub>(OAc)<sub>4</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub> adopts the "Chinese lantern" structure seen also for related Rh(II) and Cr(II) tetraacetates.<ref>van Niekerk, J. N.; Schoening, F. R. L. “X-Ray Evidence for Metal-to-Metal Bonds in Cupric and Chromous Acetate” Nature 1953, volume 171, pages 36-37. {{doi|10.1038/171036a0}}.</ref><ref>Wells, A.F. (1984). Structural Inorganic Chemistry, Oxford: Clarendon Press.</ref>  One oxygen atom on each acetate is bound to one copper at 1.97 [[angstrom|Å]] (197 [[picometer|pm]].  Completing the [[coordination sphere]] are two water [[ligand]]s, with Cu-O distances of 2.20 Å (220 pm).  The two five-coordinate copper atoms are separated by only 2.65 Å (265 pm), which is close to the Cu--Cu separation in metallic copper.<sup>[5]</sup>.  The two copper centers interact resulting in a diminishing of the magnetic moment such that near 90 [[kelvin|K]], Cu<sub>2</sub>(OAc)<sub>4</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub> is essentially diamagnetic due to cancellation of the two opposing spins.  Cu<sub>2</sub>(OAc)<sub>4</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub> was a critical step in the development of modern theories for [[antiferromagnetic]] coupling.<ref>R. L. Carlin "Magnetochemistry" Springer: Berlin, 1986</ref>

==Synthesis==
Copper(II) acetate has been synthesized for centuries by the method described in the history section.<!--really?-->  This method, however, leads to an impure copper(II) acetate.  In a laboratory, a much purer form can be synthesized in a simple three-step procedure. The overall reaction is as follows:<sup>[6]</sup>
:2 CuSO<sub>4</sub><sup>.</sup>5H<sub>2</sub>O  +  4 NH<sub>3</sub>  +  4 CH<sub>3</sub>COOH  →  Cu<sub>2</sub>(OAc)<sub>4</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>  +  2 [NH<sub>4</sub>]<sub>2</sub>[SO<sub>4</sub>] + 8 H<sub>2</sub>O

The hydrate form can be dehydrated by heating at 100 °C in a vacuum:<ref> S. J. Kirchner, Q. Fernando "Copper(I) Acetate" Inorganic Syntheses, 1980, volume XX, pages 53-55.</ref>
:Cu<sub>2</sub>(OAc)<sub>4</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>  →  Cu<sub>2</sub>(OAc)<sub>4</sub>  +  2 H<sub>2</sub>O
Heating a mixture of anhydrous Cu<sub>2</sub>(OAc)<sub>4</sub> and copper metal affords colorless, volatile cuprous acetate:<ref>Parish, E. J.; Kizito, S. A. "Copper(I) Acetate" Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis, 2001 John Wiley & Sons. DOI: 10.1002/047084289X.rc193.</ref>
:2 Cu  +  Cu<sub>2</sub>(OAc)<sub>4</sub>  →  4 CuOAc
