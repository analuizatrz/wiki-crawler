'''Taunton''' is a city in [[Bristol County, Massachusetts|Bristol County]], [[Massachusetts]],  [[United States]]. It is the  [[county seat|seat]] of [[Bristol County, Massachusetts|Bristol County]] and the hub of the [[Greater Taunton Area]]. The city is located 40 miles south of [[Boston]], 18 miles east of [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], 18 miles north of [[Fall River]] and 25 miles west of [[Plymouth, Massachusetts|Plymouth]]. The City of Taunton is situated on the [[Taunton River]] which winds its way through the city on its way south to [[Mount Hope Bay]].

As of the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]], the city had a total population of 55,976. The current mayor is Charles Crowley.

Founded in 1637, by members of the [[Plymouth Colony]], Taunton is one of the oldest towns in the [[United States]]. The city takes its name from [[Taunton]], [[England]], the birthplace of its founder, [[Elizabeth Pole]]. The name Taunton means "town (or city) on the [[River Tone]]" or "Tone Town".

Taunton's is also known as the ''Silver City'', as it was an historic center of the Silver Industry beginning in the 19th century when companies such as Reed & Barton and [[F. B. Rogers Silver Co.|F.B. Rogers]], Poole Silver and others produced fine quality silver goods in the city. 

The city provides a large annual light display each December on Taunton Green, also giving it the nickname of ''Christmas City''.

Taunton once included many surrounding towns, including [[Norton, Massachusetts|Norton]], [[Easton, Massachusetts|Easton]], [[Mansfield, Massachusetts|Mansfield]], [[Dighton, Massachusetts|Dighton]], [[Raynham, Massachusetts|Raynham]], and [[Berkley, Massachusetts|Berkley]].  Possession of the latter is still noted by the naming of [[Taunton Hill]] in [[Assonet, Massachusetts|Assonet]], which is now North Main Street, a street that heads into Berkley.

==History==

===Beginnings===
[[Image:Taunton Massachusetts - Mayflower Hill Cemetery.jpg|thumb|Mayflower Hill Cemetery]]
Taunton was founded in 1637 by [[Elizabeth Pole]], and officially [[incorporation (municipal government)|incorporated]] as a [[New England town|town]] on [[September 3]] [[1639]]. Most of the town's settlers were originally from [[Taunton]], [[Somerset]], [[England]], which led early settlers to name the settlement after that town. At the time of Taunton's incorporation, they explained their choice of name as being, ''in honor and love to our dear native country... and owning it a great mercy of God to bring us to this place, and settling of us, on lands of our own bought with our money in peace, in the midst of the heathen, for a possession for ourselves and for our posterity after us.''{{Fact|date=June 2007}} Prior to 1640, the Taunton area was called Cohannet. 

The [[England|English]] founders of Taunton took possession of the land from the native [[Wampanoag]]s. The Taunton area was the site of battles (on its soil or the surrounding area) during various conflicts, including [[King Philip's War]] and the [[American Revolution]]. Taunton was re-incorporated as a city on [[May 11]] [[1864]].

===Industrial Legacy===
[[Image:Weir_Factory.jpg|thumb|Taunton River at Weir Village, with the former F.B. Rogers Silver factory and the stacks of the TMLP in the distance]]
During the 19th century, Taunton became known as the "Silver City", as it was home to many [[silversmithing]] operations, including [[Reed & Barton]], [[F. B. Rogers Silver Co.|F.B. Rogers]], Poole Silver, and others.

In the 19th century, Taunton also was the center of an important iron making industry, utilizing much [[Bog iron|bog iron]] from the numerous swamps in the surrounding area. The iron industry in Taunton produced a variety of goods including stoves (Weir Stove Company/Glenwood), tacks (Field Tack Company) and machinery. One of the more successful companies during this period was the Mason Machine Works, founded by [[William Mason (locomotive builder)|William Mason]] which produced machinery for the textile industry, as well as steam locomotives.

Taunton was also home to several textile mills (Whittenton Mills) and other industries, such as felt (Bacon Felt) and brick making.

During the 19th century, Taunton was a major shipping point for grain from the inland rural farm areas of Massachusetts to the rest of the nation via Weir Village and the Taunton River. With the advent of the railroad, Taunton would also become an important transportation hub due to its central location.

The city formed the Taunton Municipal Light Plant (TMLP) in 1897, when it decided to purchase the floundering Taunton Electric Lighting Company, making it a publicly-owned electric utility.  Today, TMLP provides electric service to 34,000 customers in Taunton, Berkley, Raynham, and sections of Dighton, Lakeville and Bridgewater. TMLP is governed by a three-member Board of Commissioners, which is elected by the citizens of Taunton.

===Recent History===

The City of Taunton remains an important regional center of commerce and transportation. The Myles Standish Industrial Park in the city's north end is one of the largest in New England. The [[National Weather Service]] operates a Regional Forecast Office there. Several major companies operate within the Industrial Park, and in other parts of the city.

In October 2005, the nearby [[Whittenton Pond Dam]] threatened to fail following a week that brought nine inches of rain to the city. Over 2,000 city residents were evacuated<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/10/18/national/main952230.shtml | title=Town Braces For Massive Flood | publisher=CBS News | date=[[October 18]] [[2005]] | accessdate=2007-06-09}}</ref> and Mayor Robert Nunes issued a [[State of Emergency]]. It is estimated that if the dam had failed, the Mill River would have inundated the downtown area with up to six feet of water. In response, Massachusetts Governor [[Mitt Romney]] ordered an immediate inspection of high-risk dams throughout the Commonwealth.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/10/18/national/main953863.shtml | title=Mass. Dam Continues To Hold | publisher=CBS News | date=[[October 18]] [[2005]] | accessdate=2007-06-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/10/18/massachusetts.dam/index.html | title=Officials still fear dam collapse | date=[[October 18]] [[2005]] | publisher=CNN | accessdate=2007-06-09}}</ref>

In March 2008, famed Hollywood director [[Martin Scorsese]] filmed a portion of the upcoming film [[Ashecliffe]] on-location at the Whittenton Mills Complex. The movie is expected to be released in October 2009.

===Public Spaces===
The city is served by a central public library, the Taunton Public Library, which opened in 1903 
and has undergone several expansions and renovations since that time. Also of note is the [[Old Colony Historical Society]], which archives the city and region's past.

The Taunton Green is the name of the city square. Early in its history, "The Green" was used as a training ground for militias in the [[American Revolution]]. Some say it was also the site of the historic "Liberty & Union"/"Taunton" flag raising in 1774 by the [[Sons of Liberty]], prior to the American Revolution.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Taunton%2C_Massachusetts | title=Taunton, Massachusetts | publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica 11th Edition at LoveToKnow Classic Encyclopedia | year=1911/2006 | accessdate=2007-06-09}}</ref> In the 20th and 21st century, the city square was temporarily transformed during the [[winter holiday season]] into a grand display of [[Christmas]] lights, scenes, and extravagant events. This is where and how the city earned its unofficial nickname in the surrounding areas as the "Christmas City." 

"The Green" continues to provide a centralized location for city-wide Christmas activities, other holidays, events, and parades for the citizens of Taunton. A waterfall can sometimes be found at the center of the Taunton Green, although currently it is used only rarely, possibly to defray maintenance costs. 

Always to be seen flapping together in emblematic unison, the "Liberty & Union" flag and the U.S. flag fly side-by-side on the flagpole at the city's center.

The City is home to two state parks operated by the [[Department of Conservation and Recreation (Massachusetts)|Commonwealth of Massachusetts / Department of Conservation and Recreation]], including [[Massasoit State Park]] in [[East Taunton]] and Watson Pond State Park in the north part of the city.

Many large homes built by the wealthy industrialists and merchants of the late 19th and early 20th century line Route 44 both east (Dean Street) and west (Winthrop Steet) of the city center, while a majority of the city is occupied by more modest wood framed single and multi-family homes, many over 100 years old. Modern single-family [[Subdivision (land)|subdivisions]] mostly built since the 1950's exist in the outskirts of the sprawling city.

This hospital is now one of the very few mental health hospitals in Massachusetts for longer term in-patient care of psychiatric patinets. 

Electricity is provided to residents by the Taunton Municipal Lighting Plant (TMLP), located in the south end. The City has a Municipal water system, with a treatment plant and water supply in nearby [[Lakeville, Massachusetts|Lakeville]], as well as a public sewer system with a treatment plant on West Water Street in the south end of the city, discharging into the Taunton River.

==Transportation==
{{seealso|Old Colony Railroad}}
The [[Taunton Branch Railroad|Taunton Railway]] began in 1838 (201 years after its founding by Elizabeth Pole from Dorchester, The [[Dorchester Company]] started in 1623 as part of the [[Sheffield Patent]] settling at Stage Point, Gloucester, Cape Anne) as the main rail transportation system both industrial and passenger connecting Taunton with points south, east, north, and west including New Bedford and Cape Cod, Fall River and Newport, Somerset and Providence, Attleboro and Providence, Mansfield and Boston, Stoughton and Boston, Raynham Middleborough and Wareham as time went on.  Taunton is the central highway hub of southeastern Massachusetts. Much of the eastern part of the state's major highways intersect and/or runs through the city, especially at its center. [[U.S. Highway 44|US 44]], [[Massachusetts Route 138|MA 138]], and [[Massachusetts Route 140|MA 140]] intersect at a square at Taunton's center, which is called the Taunton Green. MA 140 is also accessible from the eastern neighborhood of the city, popularly referred to as "East Taunton." Additionally, [[Route 24 (Massachusetts)|MA 24]] and MA 140 intersect near East Taunton, and it is at that junction that Route 140 ceases to be a 2-lane divided freeway from the south and becomes a smaller state highway to the north. [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 495]] runs through the northern portion of Taunton, unofficially referred to as "North Taunton", and parallel to Myles Standish Industrial Park, Taunton's main industrial park.

Various smaller routes run through other parts of the city. These include a small portion of [[Massachusetts Route 104|MA 104]], close to the Taunton-Raynham city limits, and [[Massachusetts Route 79|MA 79]], close to the Taunton-Berkley-Lakeville ([[Plymouth County, Massachusetts|Plymouth County]]) city-town-county limits. Taunton is the western terminus of MA 104. It merges into US 44 after entering the city. 

Several freight rails pass through the city on their way towards Fall River, New Bedford and a link-up with the line in Middleborough. There are plans being worked on to link up parts of this rail with the Stoughton line of the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|MBTA]] commuter rail system to Boston. The [[Greater Attleboro Taunton Regional Transit Authority]], or GATRA, provides bus [[Public transport|mass transit]].

Taunton also has its own [[Taunton Municipal Airport|municipal airport]], serving mostly smaller craft and occasional commuter jets. The nearest airport with national airline service is at [[T.F. Green Airport]] in Rhode Island, and the nearest international service is at [[Logan International Airport]] in Boston.
