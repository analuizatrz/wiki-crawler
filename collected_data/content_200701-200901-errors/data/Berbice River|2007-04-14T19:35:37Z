The '''Berbice River''', located in eastern [[Guyana]], rises in the highlands of the [[Rupununi]] region. The Berbice flows northward for 370 miles (595 km) through dense forests to the coastal plain. The river's tidal limit is between 160 and 320 km from the sea.

The town of [[New Amsterdam, Guyana|New Amsterdam]] is situated on the river’s east bank, approximately four miles inside the river’s estuary, where it enters the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. A ferry crosses the river from New Amsterdam to [[Rosignol]].

Obstructed by shallows at its estuary, the Berbice River’s mouth is the location of [[Crab Island, Guyana|Crab Island]], opposite the mouth of the [[Canje River]], the Berbice's main tributary.  

In [[1627]], the settlement of [[Nassau, Guiana|Nassau]] (the name was used for many of the Dutch forts in the seventeenth century) was founded by the [[Dutch West India Company]].

In May [[2004]], construction of a floating bridge linking D’Edward Village, Crab Island, and the [[Corentyne Highway]] was announced.

Other communities on the Berbice River include [[Everton, Guyana|Everton]], [[Marajuana, Guyana|Mara]], [[Takama]], [[Kalkuni]] and [[Kwakwani]].
