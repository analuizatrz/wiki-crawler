== History ==
{{main article|History of East Carolina University}}
[[Image:NC-Congress-ThomasJordanJarvis.jpg|thumb|left|Father of East Carolina University, [[Thomas Jordan Jarvis]]]]
Public Laws of North Carolina , 1907, Chapter 820 titled "AN ACT TO STIMULATE HIGH SCHOOL INSTRUCTION IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS OF THE STATE AND TEACHER TRAINING" was the official law chartering '''East Carolina Teachers Training School''' (ECTTS) on [[March 8]], [[1907]] by the [[North Carolina General Assembly|General Assembly]].<ref>http://www.ecu.edu/cs-lib/archives/pr_display.cfm?id=49</ref> The chairman of its original board of trustees, [[Thomas Jordan Jarvis|T. J. Jarvis]], a former [[Governor of North Carolina]] now known as the "Father of ECU," participated in groundbreaking ceremonies for the first buildings on [[July 2]], [[1908]] and ECTTS opened its doors on [[October 5]], [[1909]].<ref>http://www.ecu.edu/cs-admin/news/releases/2007/2/02082007ecujarvisexhibit.cfm</ref><ref>http://www.ecu.edu/cs-lib/archives/pr_display.cfm?id=64</ref><ref>http://www.ecu.edu/cs-lib/archives/pr_display.cfm?id=553</ref> Although its purpose was to train "young white men and women," there were no male graduates until [[1932]].<ref>http://www.ecu.edu/cs-lib/archives/pr_display.cfm?id=982</ref> In [[1921]] ECTTS became a four-year institution and was renamed '''East Carolina Teachers College''' (ECTC); its first bachelor's degrees were awarded the following year.<ref>http://www.ecu.edu/cs-lib/archives/timeline.cfm</ref> A master's degree program was authorized in [[1929]]; the first such degree granted by ECTC was in [[1933]].<ref>http://www.ecu.edu/cs-lib/archives/timeline.cfm</ref> Progress toward full college status was made in [[1948]] with the designation of the [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] as a liberal arts degree, and the [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] as a teaching degree.<ref>http://www.ecu.edu/cs-lib/archives/timeline.cfm</ref> A change of name to '''East Carolina College''' in [[1951]] reflected this expanded mission.<ref>http://www.ecu.edu/cs-lib/archives/timeline.cfm</ref>  Over the objections of [[Dan K. Moore|Governor Dan K. Moore]], who opposed the creation of a university system separate from the Consolidated University of North Carolina, ECC was made a regional university effective [[July 1]], [[1967]], and assumed its present name, '''East Carolina University'''.<ref>http://www.ecu.edu/cs-lib/archives/pr_display.cfm?id=546</ref> It did not, however, remain independent for long; on [[July 1]], [[1972]], it was incorporated into the [[University of North Carolina System]], the successor to the Consolidated University.<ref>http://www.ga.unc.edu/UNC_Schools/profiles/current/ecu.pdf</ref>
