==Film and television career==

He moved to [[New York City]] and became a member of "The Impossible Ragtime Theater." In that company, Frakes did his first off-Broadway acting in  [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s ''The Hairy Ape''. His first Broadway appearance was in ''[[Shenandoah (musical)|Shenandoah]]''. At the same time, he landed a role in the [[NBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[The Doctors]]''. When his character was dismissed from the soap, Frakes moved to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]] and played guest spots in many of the top television shows of the 1970s and [[1980s]], including ''[[The Waltons]]'', ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]'',  ''[[Matlock (TV series)|Matlock]]'', and Steven Bochco's ''[[Hill Street Blues]]''. He played the part of [[Charles Lindbergh]] in a 1983 episode of ''[[Voyagers!]]'' titled ''An Arrow Pointing East'' and had recurring roles in ''[[Falcon Crest]]'' and ''[[North and South (TV miniseries)|North & South]]'' before signing for the role of Riker on ''Star Trek: The Next Generation''.

He hosted ''[[Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction]]'' and had a small, uncredited role in the 1994 movie ''[[Camp Nowhere]]''. 

Frakes is the only ''Star Trek'' regular besides [[Majel Barrett]] to appear on four different ''Star Trek'' series (''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'').  He has also directed episodes in three of them (''TNG'', ''DS9'' and ''VOY'') and was a popular and innovative director on the Star Trek set, often finding completely new ways to shoot the show's familiar sets.

His talents are not limited to the acting arts. Frakes appears on the [[Phish]] album ''[[Hoist (album)|Hoist]]'', playing [[trombone]] on the track titled "Riker's Mailbox." Indeed, Frakes would occasionally perform on the trombone during his tenure as Commander Riker.
