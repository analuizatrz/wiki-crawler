'''''Batman Begins''''' is a [[2005 in film|2005]] [[Cinema of the United States|American]] [[superhero film]] based on the fictional [[DC Comics]] character [[Batman]], directed by [[Christopher Nolan]]. It stars [[Christian Bale]] as Batman, along with [[Michael Caine]], [[Gary Oldman]], [[Liam Neeson]], [[Katie Holmes]], [[Cillian Murphy]], [[Morgan Freeman]], [[Ken Watanabe]], [[Tom Wilkinson]], and [[Rutger Hauer]]. The film [[reboot (fiction)|reboots]] the [[Batman (film series)|''Batman'' film series]], telling the [[origin story]] of the character and begins with Bruce Wayne's initial [[fear of bats]], the death of his parents, and his journey to becoming Batman. It draws inspiration from classic [[comic book]] storylines such as ''[[Batman: The Man Who Falls]]'', ''[[Batman: Year One]]'', and ''[[Batman: The Long Halloween]]''.

After [[Batman (film series)#Batman V|a series of unsuccessful projects]] to resurrect Batman on screen following the [[1997 in film|1997]] critical and commercial failure of ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'', Nolan and [[David S. Goyer]] began work on the film in early 2003 and aimed for a darker and more realistic tone, with humanity and realism being the basis of the film. The goal was to get the audience to care for both Batman and Bruce. The film, which was primarily shot in England and Chicago, relied on traditional stunts and [[miniatures]] — [[computer-generated imagery]] was used minimally. A new [[Batmobile]] (called [[Batmobile (Batman Begins)|the Tumbler]]) and a more mobile [[Batsuit]] were both created specifically for the film.

''Batman Begins'' was critically and commercially successful. The film opened on June 15, 2005 in the United States and Canada in 3,858 theaters. It grossed [[United States dollar|US$]]48 million in its opening weekend, eventually grossing $370 million worldwide. The film received an 84% overall approval rating from [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. Critics noted that fear was a common theme throughout the film, and remarked that it had a darker tone compared to previous ''Batman'' films. A sequel titled ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' was released in July 2008 and also saw the return of both Nolan and Bale to the franchise. The film has also popularized the notion of reboots in Hollywood.

==Plot==
Eight-year-old Bruce Wayne falls into a cave, where he encounters a swarm of bats. Later, he accompanies his parents to a production of ''[[Mefistofele]]'', which features actors dressed as bats. Having developed a [[fear of bats]], he urges his parents to leave the opera. Outside the theater, they are mugged by [[Joe Chill]], who proceeds to kill the parents. Although Chill is later arrested, Bruce blames himself for his parents' murders.

Years later, Bruce returns to [[Gotham City]] from [[Princeton University]], intent on killing Chill, whose prison sentence is being [[suspended sentence|suspended]] in exchange for testifying against mobster [[Carmine Falcone]]. Before he can act, a woman posing as a reporter kills Chill for Falcone. Bruce tells his childhood friend [[Rachel Dawes]] about his plan, and she expresses disgust for his disregard for justice. Bruce confronts Falcone, who tells him that he is ignorant of the nature of crime, so Bruce decides to travel the world to understand the criminal mind. After nearly seven years, he is detained for theft in a [[Bhutan]]ese prison, where he meets [[Henri Ducard]]. Ducard invites Bruce to join an elite vigilante group, the [[League of Assassins|League of Shadows]], led by [[Ra's al Ghul]]. Bruce is freed and travels to a mountaintop to begin his training with the League. Bruce overcomes his childhood fear of bats in the process. When he is ordered to execute a criminal and learns of Ra's intention to destroy Gotham, he refuses and escapes by lighting the League's temple on fire, killing Ra's in the process. Bruce rescues an unconscious Ducard from the wreckage and leaves him at a village.

[[Image:Blueflower.jpg|left|thumb|Bruce Wayne is instructed to gather this blue flower. They are the source of the fear-inducing hallucinogenic compound used by Scarecrow to taint Gotham's water supply.]]

Bruce returns to a Gotham City ruled by Falcone, and plots his war against the city's corrupt system. He seeks the help of Rachel, now an assistant [[district attorney]], and police sergeant [[James Gordon (comics)|Jim Gordon]], who consoled him after his parents' murder. After reestablishing his connections to [[Wayne Enterprises]] (now run by William Earle) Bruce acquires, with the help of former board member [[Lucius Fox]], a [[Batmobile#Nolan film series|prototype armored car]] and an experimental [[Batsuit#Batman Begins|armored suit]]. In his first night, he disrupts a drug shipment, and leaves Falcone tied to a searchlight, forming a makeshift [[Bat-Signal]]. He also disrupts an assassination attempt on Rachel, leaving her with evidence against a judge on Falcone's payroll. While investigating the drugs in the shipment, Batman is stunned by psychopharmacologist [[Scarecrow (comics)|Dr. Jonathan Crane]], who sprays him with a powerful hallucinogen. Bruce's butler [[Alfred Pennyworth]] rescues him, using an anti-toxin developed by Fox to save him. Crane later poisons Rachel after showing her that the toxin, which is harmful in vapor form, is being piped into the city [[water supply network|water supply]]. Batman saves her and attacks Crane with his own poison. When the police arrive at [[Arkham Asylum|Arkham]] to arrest Crane, Batman escapes with Rachel in the Batmobile. After administering the antidote to her in the [[Batcave]], he gives her two vials of it for Gordon – one for inoculating himself and the other for mass-production.

Later, in [[Wayne Manor]], Bruce is confronted at his birthday celebration by a group of League of Shadows ninjas led by Ducard, who reveals himself to be the real Ra's al Ghul, and that the man killed earlier was a decoy. Ra's, who had been conspiring with Crane the entire time, plans to destroy Gotham by distributing the toxin via the city's water supply, and vaporizing it with a microwave-emitter stolen from Wayne Enterprises. Bruce dismisses his guests by insulting them while pretending to be drunk, and fights briefly with Ra's while the League set fire to the Manor. At the last minute, Bruce escapes the inferno with Alfred's help. Batman arrives at the Narrows section of Gotham to aid the police in battling psychotic criminals, including Crane, now calling himself "Scarecrow", whom the League set free. Rachel is briefly confronted by Crane, but quickly wards him off with a taser before being chased by more inmates. After saving her, Batman reveals his identity to her, and leaves Gordon in control of the Batmobile to stop the [[elevated train]] used to transport the weapon to the city's central water-hub. Batman battles Ra's aboard the train, then escapes just as Gordon topples the elevated line using the Batmobile's missiles, leaving Ra's to crash to the ground and perish in the explosion.

Following the battle, Batman becomes a public hero. Bruce gains control of Wayne Enterprises and installs Fox as  the new CEO, firing Earle. However, he is unable to hold onto Rachel, who cannot reconcile her love for Bruce with his dual life as Batman. Newly Lieutenant Gordon unveils a [[Bat-Signal]] for Batman. Gordon mentions that they will have their hands full finding all of the psychopaths released from Arkham by Ra's, and in particular notes [[Joker (comics)|a criminal]] who also has "a taste for the theatrical" and leaves [[Joker playing card]]s at all of his crime scenes. Batman promises to investigate it and leaves.

==Cast==
'''[[Christian Bale]]''' as '''[[Batman|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]''': A billionaire industrialist whose parents were killed by a mugger when he was eight years old. Traveling the world for several years to seek the means to fight injustice, he returns to Gotham. At night, Bruce becomes Batman, Gotham City's vigilante protector. Bale was cast on September 11, 2003,<ref name="dynamic"/> having expressed interest in playing Batman since [[Darren Aronofsky]] was planning his own film adaptation.<ref name=originalpsycho>{{cite news|author=Smith, Adam|title=The Original American Psycho|work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|date=July 2005|pages=74–80, 82, 84, 87}}</ref> Nolan was also considering [[Billy Crudup]], [[Jake Gyllenhaal]], [[Hugh Dancy]], [[Joshua Jackson]], [[Eion Bailey]] and [[Cillian Murphy]] for the role.<ref name="dynamic">{{cite news|first=Cathy|last=Dunkley|coauthors=Bing, Jonathan|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117891989.html?categoryid=1019&cs=1|title=Inside Move: New dynamic for WB duo|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=2003-09-07|accessdate=2006-11-02}}</ref> Bale felt the previous films underused Batman's character, overplaying the villains instead.<ref>{{cite news|title=A crash but no tickets for Bale's Batmobile in Chicago|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=2004-11-19|author=Pearlman, Cindy}}</ref> To best pose as Batman, Bale studied graphic novels and illustrations of the superhero.<ref name="batsuit"/>

Director Nolan said of Bale, "He has exactly the balance of darkness and light that we were looking for."<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Warner Bros.]]|url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/batmannews.php?id=113|title=Official: Christian Bale is ''Batman''!|publisher=[[Superhero Hype!]]|date=2003-09-11|accessdate=2006-11-02}}</ref> Goyer stated that while some actors could play a great Bruce Wayne or a great Batman, Bale could portray both radically different personalities.<ref name=journeybegins/> Bale described the part as playing four characters: the raging Batman persona; the idiotic playboy façade Bruce uses to ward off suspicion; the vengeful young man; and the older, angrier Bruce who is discovering his purpose in life.<ref>{{cite news|author=Hutchins, John|title=Christian Bale|work=[[UGO Networks]]|year=2005|url=http://batman.ugo.com/movies/batman_begins/bale.asp|accessdate=2007-08-29}}</ref> Bale's dislike of his costume, which heated up regularly, helped him get into a necessarily foul mood. He said, "Batman's meant to be fierce, and you become a beast in that suit, as Batman should be – not a man in a suit, but a different creature."<ref name="batsuit" />

Since he had lost a great deal of weight in preparation for his role in ''[[The Machinist]]'', Bale hired a personal trainer to help him gain {{convert|100|lb}} in the span of only a couple of months to help him physically prepare for the role. He first went well over the weight required and created concern over whether he'd look right for the part. Bale recognized that his large physique was not appropriate for Batman, who relies on speed and strategy. He managed to lose the excess muscle by the time filming began.<ref name=journeybegins/> The role of Bruce Wayne at age eight was portrayed by [[Gus Lewis]].<ref>{{cite web|accessmonthday=July 13|accessyear=2008|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/reviews/movies/BATMANBEGINS.DTL&type=movies|title=The caped crusader has come back.

'''[[Michael Caine]]''' as '''[[Alfred Pennyworth]]''': The trusted butler to Bruce Wayne's parents, who continues his loyal service to their son after their deaths. He is Bruce Wayne's closest confidante. Nolan felt Caine would effectively portray the [[foster father]] element of the character.<ref name=journeybegins/> Although Alfred's family is depicted in the film as having served the Wayne family for generations, Caine created his own backstory, in that before becoming Wayne's butler, Alfred served in the [[Special Air Service]]. After being wounded, he was invited to the position of the Wayne family butler by Thomas Wayne because, "He wanted a butler, but someone a bit tougher than that, you know?"<ref>{{cite news|title=Alfred the Butler|work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|date=July 2005|page=79}}</ref> 

'''[[Liam Neeson]]''' as '''[[Henri Ducard]]''': In reality the true '''[[Ra's al Ghul]]''' in disguise, Ducard trains Bruce in [[ninjutsu]], a form of [[martial arts]]. Writer David Goyer said he felt Ra's was the most complex of all the Batman villains, comparing him to [[Osama bin Laden]] as, "He's not crazy in the way that all the other Batman villains are. He's not bent on revenge; he's actually trying to heal the world.

'''[[Katie Holmes]]''' as '''[[Rachel Dawes]]''': A childhood friend of Bruce who serves as Gotham City's assistant [[district attorney]], fighting against the corruption in the city. Nolan found a "tremendous warmth and great emotional appeal" in Holmes, and also felt "she has a maturity beyond her years that comes across in the film and is essential to the idea that Rachel is something of a moral conscience for Bruce".<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-07-13|url=http://www.timeout.com/film/newyork/news/488/batman-begins-press-conference-part-two.html|title='Batman Begins' press conference, part two|work=Time Out – New York|date=2005-06-16}}</ref>

'''[[Gary Oldman]]''' as '''[[James Gordon (comics)|Sgt. James Gordon]]''': One of the few uncorrupted [[Gotham City Police Department|Gotham City police officers]]. He was the officer on duty the night of the murder of Bruce Wayne's parents. In this way, he shares a special bond with the adult Bruce and thus with Batman.

'''[[Cillian Murphy]]''' as '''[[Scarecrow (comics)|Dr. Jonathan Crane / The Scarecrow]]''': A [[psychopharmacology|psychopharmacologist]] who works at [[Arkham Asylum]] and has developed fear-inducing toxins. He takes on the persona of the Scarecrow to intimidate others and further his study of fears and phobias.

'''[[Morgan Freeman]]''' as '''[[Lucius Fox]]''': A high-ranking [[Wayne Enterprises]] employee who was demoted to working in the company's Applied Science Division, where he conducts advanced studies in [[biochemistry]] and [[mechanical engineering]]. Fox supplies Bruce with much of the gear necessary to carry out Batman's mission and is promoted to CEO when Bruce repossesses the company by the end of the film.

==Production==
===Development===
{{see|Batman (film series)#Batman V}} 

In January 2003, [[Warner Bros.]] hired ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'' director [[Christopher Nolan]] to direct an untitled ''Batman'' film,<ref>{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Fleming|url=http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=story&articleid=VR1117879566&categoryid=13&cs=1|title='Batman' captures director Nolan|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=2003-01-27|accessdate=2006-11-02}}</ref> and [[David S.

Nolan said that humanity and realism would be the basis of the origin film, and that "the world of Batman is that of grounded reality. [It] will be a recognizable, contemporary reality against which an extraordinary heroic figure arises." Goyer said that the goal of the film was to get the audience to care for both Batman and Bruce Wayne.<ref name="beautiful">{{cite news|first=Marc|last=Graser|coauthors=Dunkley, Cathy|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117899714.html?categoryid=13&cs=1|title=The bat and the beautiful|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=2004-02-08|accessdate=2006-11-02}}</ref> Nolan felt the previous films were exercises in style rather than drama, and described his inspiration as being [[Richard Donner]]'s 1978 ''[[Superman (film)|Superman]]'', in its focus on depicting the character's growth.<ref name=originalpsycho/> Also similar to ''Superman'', Nolan wanted an all-star supporting cast for ''Batman Begins'' to lend a more epic feel and credibility to the story.<ref name=journeybegins/>

Nolan's personal "jumping off point" of inspiration was ''[[Batman: The Man Who Falls]]'', a short story about Bruce's travels throughout the world. The early scene in ''Batman Begins'' of young Bruce Wayne falling into a well was adapted from ''The Man Who Falls''.<ref name="genesis">{{cite video | people=[[Dan DiDio|DiDio, Dan]] (Vice President of DC Comics), [[David S.

The writers of ''Batman Begins'' also used Frank Miller's ''Year One'' plot device, which was about a corrupt police force that led to Gordon and [[Gotham City]]'s need for Batman.<ref name="genesis" />

A common idea in the comics is that Bruce saw a [[Zorro]] film with his parents before they were murdered. Nolan explained that by ignoring that idea &ndash; which he stated is not found in Batman's first appearances &ndash; it emphasized the importance of bats to Bruce and that becoming a superhero is a wholly original idea on his part. It is for this reason Nolan believes other DC characters do not exist in the universe of his film, otherwise Wayne's reasons for taking up costumed vigilantism would have been very different.<ref>{{cite news|author=Geoff Boucher|title=Christopher Nolan says his Batman doesn't play well with others|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2008-10-29|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2008/10/christopher-n-2.html|accessdate=2008-10-30}}</ref>

===Filming===
As with all his films, Nolan refused a [[second unit]] to keep his vision consistent.<ref name=shoot>{{cite web|title=Batman Begins Production Notes - About the Production|publisher=[[Warner Bros.]]|url=http://www2.warnerbros.com/batmanbegins/productionnotes/#|accessdate=2007-02-24}}</ref> Filming began in March 2004 in the [[Vatnajokull]] glacier in [[Iceland]] (standing in for [[Bhutan]]).<ref name=shoot/> The crew built a village and the front doors to Ra's temple,<ref name=discovery/> as well as a road to access the remote area.<ref name=shoot/> The weather was problematic, with {{convert|75|mph}} winds,<ref name=shoot/> rain, and a lack of snow. A shot [[Wally Pfister]] had planned with a crane had to be done with a handheld camera.<ref name=discovery/>

In seeking inspiration from ''[[Superman (film)|Superman]]'' and other blockbuster films of the late 1970s and early 1980s, Nolan based most of the production in England, specifically [[Shepperton Studios]].<ref>{{cite news|title=`Batman Begins' goes to the source|work=The Kansas City Star|date=June 25, 2004}}</ref> A [[Batcave]] set was built there and measured {{convert|250|ft}} long, {{convert|120|ft}} wide, and {{convert|40|ft}} high.

Despite the film's darkness, Nolan wanted to make the film appeal to a wide age range. "Not the youngest kids obviously, I think what we’ve done is probably a bit intense for them but I certainly didn’t want to exclude the sort of ten to 12-year olds, because as a kid I would have loved to have seen a movie like this." Because of this, nothing gory or bloody was filmed.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-07-13|url=http://www.timeout.com/film/news/488/|title='Batman Begins' press conference, part two|publisher=Time Out London|date=2005-06-16}}</ref>

===Design===
Nolan used the [[cult film|cult]] [[science fiction film]] ''[[Blade Runner]]'' as a source of inspiration for ''Batman Begins''. He screened ''Blade Runner'' to cinematographer [[Wally Pfister]] and two others to show the attitude and style that he wanted to draw from the film. Nolan described the film's world as "an interesting lesson on the technique of exploring and describing a credible universe that doesn't appear to have any boundaries", a lesson that he applied to the production of ''Batman Begins''.<ref>{{cite news|first=Pat|last=Jankiewicz|title=Dark Knight Resurrected|work=[[Starlog]]|date=August 2005|accessdate=2006-11-06}}</ref>

Nolan worked with production designer Nathan Crowley to create the look of [[Gotham City]]. Crowley built a model of the city that filled Nolan's garage.<ref name=rise>''Gotham City Rises'' [DVD, 2005]</ref> Crowley and Nolan designed it as a large, modern metropolitan area that would reflect the various periods of architecture that the city had gone through. Elements were drawn from New York City, Chicago, and Tokyo; the latter for its elevated freeways and monorails. The Narrows was based on the [[slum]]mish nature of the (now demolished) [[Kowloon Walled City|walled city of Kowloon]] in Hong Kong.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jeff|last=Otto|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/622/622719p1.html|title=Interview: Christopher Nolan|work=[[IGN]]|date=2006-06-05|accessdate=2006-11-06}}</ref>

====Batmobile====
[[Image:Batman Begins Batmobile1.jpg|thumb|The Tumbler, the [[Batmobile]] used in ''Batman Begins'']]

Crowley started the process of designing the Tumbler for the film by [[kitbashing|model bashing]]. Crowley used the nose cone of a [[P-38 Lightning]] model to serve as the chassis for the Tumbler's jet engine. Six models of the Tumbler were built to 1:12 scale in the course of four months. Following the scale model creation, a crew of over 30 people, including Crowley and engineers Chris Culvert and Annie Smith, carved a full-size replica of the Tumbler out of a large block of [[Styrofoam]] in two months.<ref name="batmobile">{{cite web|first=Marshall|last=Brain|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/batmobile.htm/printable|title=How the Batmobile Works|work=[[HowStuffWorks]]|accessdate=2006-11-05}}</ref>

The Styrofoam model was used to create a steel "test frame", which had to stand up to several standards: have a speed of over {{convert|100|mph}}, go from 0 to {{convert|60|mph}} in 5 seconds, possess a [[steering]] system to make sharp turns at city corners, and withstand a self-propelled launch of up to {{convert|30|ft|m}}. On the first jump test, the Tumbler's front end collapsed and had to be completely rebuilt. The basic configuration of the newly designed Tumbler included a 5.7-liter Chevy [[V8 engine]], a truck axle for the rear axle, front tires by Hoosier (which are actually dirt racing tires used on the right rear of open wheel sprint cars), rear 4x4 mud tires by Interco., and the [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] system of Baja racing trucks. The design and development process took nine months and cost several million dollars.<ref name="batmobile"/>

[[Image:Batman Begins Batmobile2.jpg|thumb|left|The rear of the Tumbler, showing the flaps and engine]]

With the design process complete, four street-ready race cars were constructed, with each vehicle possessing 65 [[carbon fiber]] panels and costing $250,000 to build. Two of the four cars were specialized versions. One version was the flap version, which had hydraulics and flaps to detail the close-up shots where the vehicle propelled itself through the air. The other version was the jet version, in which an actual jet engine was mounted onto the vehicle, fueled by six [[propane]] tanks. Due to the poor visibility inside the vehicle by the driver, monitors were connected to cameras on the vehicle body. The professional drivers for the Tumblers practiced driving the vehicles for six months before they drove on the streets of Chicago for the film's scenes.<ref name="batmobile"/>

The interior of the Tumbler was an immobile studio set and not actually the interior of a street-capable Tumbler. The cockpit was over-sized to fit cameras for scenes filmed in the Tumbler interior. In addition, another version of the Tumbler was a [[radio-controlled car|miniature model]] that was 1:5 scale of the actual Tumbler. This miniature model had an electric motor and was used to show the Tumbler flying across ravines and between buildings. However, the actual Tumbler was used for the waterfall sequence.<ref name="batmobile"/>

====Batsuit====
[[Image:Batman bale small.jpg|upright|thumb|The Batsuit of ''Batman Begins'', worn by [[Christian Bale]]]]

The filmmakers intended to create a very mobile [[Batsuit]] that would allow the wearer to move easily to fight and crouch. Previous film incarnations of the Batsuit had been stiff and especially restricted full head movement. [[Costume design]]er [[Lindy Hemming]] and her crew worked on the Batsuit at an FX workshop codenamed "Cape Town", a secured compound located at Shepperton Studios in London. The Batsuit's basic design was a [[neoprene]] undersuit, which was shaped by attaching molded cream latex sections. Christian Bale was molded and sculpted prior to his physical training so the team could work on a full body cast. To avoid imperfections picked up by sculpting with clay, plastiline was used to smooth the surface. In addition, the team brewed different mixtures of foam to find the mixture that would be the most flexible, light, durable, and black. The latter presented a problem, since the process to make the foam black reduced the foam's durability.<ref name="batsuit">{{cite web|url=http://www2.warnerbros.com/batmanbegins/productionnotes/#|title=''Batman Begins'' Production Notes - The Batsuit & Gadgetry|publisher=[[Warner Brothers]]|accessdate=2006-11-06}}</ref>

For the cape, director Christopher Nolan wanted to have a "flowing cloak... that blows and flows as in so many great graphic novels". Hemming's team created the cape out of their own version of parachute nylon that had electrostatic flocking, a process shared with the team by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|British Ministry of Defence]]. The process was used by the London police force to minimize night vision detection. The cape was topped by a cowl, which was designed by Nolan, Hemming, and costume effects supervisor Graham Churchyard. The cowl was created to be thin enough to allow motion but thick enough to avoid wrinkling when Bale turned his head in the Batsuit. Churchyard explained the cowl had been designed to show "a man who has angst", so his character would be revealed through the mask.<ref name="batsuit" />

===Special effects===
For ''Batman Begins'', Nolan preferred using traditional stuntwork over [[computer generated imagery]].<ref name=originalpsycho/> [[Scale model]]s were used to represent the Narrows and Ra's al Ghul's temple.<ref name=rise/><ref name=discovery>''Journey to Discovery'' [DVD, 2005]</ref> There were, however, several establishing shots that were CG composite images; that is, an image composed of multiple images. Examples include Gotham's skyline, exterior shots of Wayne Tower, and some of the exterior monorail shots.<ref name=rise/> The climactic monorail sequence mixed live action footage, model work, and CGI.<ref name=save>''Saving Gotham City'' [DVD, 2005]</ref>

The bats were entirely digital, as it was decided directing real bats on set would be problematic. Dead bats were scanned to create digital models. Locations and sets were recreated on the computer so the flying bats would not be superfluous once incorporated into the finished film.<ref name=rise/>

===Soundtrack===
{{seealso|Batman Begins (soundtrack)|l1=Batman Begins soundtrack}}

The score for ''Batman Begins'' was composed by [[Hans Zimmer]] and [[James Newton Howard]]. Nolan originally invited Zimmer to compose the music, and Zimmer asked Nolan if he could invite Howard to compose as well, as they had always planned a collaboration.<ref name=knightmusic>{{cite news|author=Graydon, Danny|title=A Little Knight Music|publisher=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|date=July 2005|page=87}}</ref> The two composers collaborated on separate themes for the "split personality" of Bruce Wayne and his alter ego, Batman. Zimmer and Howard began composing in Los Angeles and moved to London where they stayed for twelve weeks to complete most of their writing.<ref>{{cite news|author=D., Spence|url=http://music.ign.com/articles/624/624382p1.html|title=Batman Vs. Hans Zimmer & James Newton Howard Part 1|work=[[IGN]]|date=2005-06-10|accessdate=2006-12-01}}</ref> Zimmer and Howard sought inspiration for shaping the score by visiting the ''Batman Begins'' sets.<ref name="zimmer">{{cite news|author=D., Spence|url=http://music.ign.com/articles/624/624641p1.html|title=Batman Vs. Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard Part 2|work=[[IGN]]|date=2005-06-13|accessdate=2006-12-01}}</ref>

Zimmer wanted to avoid writing music that had been done in earlier Batman films, so the score became an amalgamation of orchestra and electronic music. The film's ninety-piece orchestra<ref name=knightmusic/> was developed from members of various London orchestras, and Zimmer chose to use more than the normal number of cellos. Zimmer enlisted a boy soprano to help reflect the music in some of film's scenes where Bruce Wayne's parents tragic memories are involved. "He's singing a fairly pretty tune and then he gets stuck, it's like froze, arrested development," said Zimmer. He also attempted to add human dimension to Batman, whose behavior would typically be seen as "psychotic", through the music. Both composers collaborated to create 2 hours and 20 minutes worth of music for the film.<ref name="zimmer"/> Zimmer composed the action sequences, while Howard focused on the film's drama.<ref name=knightmusic/>

==Themes==
<!-- father figure -->
Comic book writer and author Danny Fingeroth argues that a strong theme in the film is Bruce's search for a father figure, saying "[Alfred] is the good father that Bruce comes to depend on. Bruce’s real father died before they could establish an adult relationship, and Liam Neeson’s Ducard is stern and demanding, didactic and challenging, but not a father figure with any sympathy. If Bruce is anyone’s son, it is Alfred’s. [Morgan] Freeman’s Lucius is cool and imperturbable, another steady anchor in Bruce’s life."<ref name=fingerothvfx>{{cite news|author=Fingeroth, Danny|title=Batman Begins: Redefining the Dark Knight|work=VFXWorld|date=2005-06-15|url=http://vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&id=2523&page=1|accessdate=2007-10-13}}</ref> English professor Mark Fisher of the [[University of Florida]] states that Bruce's search for justice requires him to learn from a proper father figure, with Thomas Wayne and Ra's al Ghul being the two counterpoints. Alfred provides a maternal figure of unconditional love, despite the overall lack of focus on a mother figure in Bruce's life.<ref>{{cite paper|author=Fisher, Mark|title=Gothic Oedipus: subjectivity and Capitalism in Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins|work=[[English studies|English Department]], [[University of Florida]]|year=2006|url=http://www.english.ufl.edu/imagetext/archives/v2_2/fisher/#13|accessdate=2007-10-13}}</ref>

<!-- fear -->
Fingeroth also argues that a major theme in the film is fear, which supports the story of Bruce Wayne becoming a hero. Director Christopher Nolan stated that the idea behind the film was "a person who would confront his innermost fear and then attempt to become it". Fingeroth referred to this film's depiction as "the man with fear – but who rises above it". The theme of fear is further personified by the choice of antagonist, the Scarecrow.<ref name=fingerothvfx/> The film depicts how fear can affect all creatures regardless of might. Allusions to fear are seen throughout, from Bruce's conquering of his demons, to becoming Batman, to the Scarecrow and his deadly fear toxin. The macabre, distorted images presented in the Scarecrow's toxin-induced hallucinations also express the idea of terror to an extreme.<ref name="rebuilds">{{cite web|accessdate=2008-07-13|url=http://english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp?menu=c10400&no=231718&rel_no=1|title=Thrilling 'Batman Begins' Rebuilds Franchise|publisher=OhmyNews|date=2005-06-14|author=Orndorf, Brian}}</ref>

<!-- comparisons -->
Critic Brian Orndorf considered ''Batman Begins'' "fierce" and "demonstrative in brood", giving the film an abundance of gravitas and energy. It strays away from the lighter fare of [[Joel Schumacher]]'s 1997 Batman film, ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'', which contained [[Camp (style)|camp]] one-liners throughout. The theme of fear is intensified with the help of the musical score by Zimmer and Howard, which also "eschews traditional heroic themes".<ref name="rebuilds" /> Also contrary to previous Batman films, a psychological investigation of Bruce Wayne's split personality in the bat suit is only lightly touched upon. Orndorf noted that Bruce is a "character constantly striving to do the right thing, not worn down by incessant reexamination".<ref name="rebuilds" />

==Reception==
===Reviews===
Based on 250 reviews collected by ''[[Rotten Tomatoes]]'', ''Batman Begins'' currently garners an 84% "fresh" rating.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/batman_begins/|title=Batman Begins|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=2008-02-02}}</ref> The film's reception was more ambivalent within the 40 reviews in Rotten Tomatoes' "Cream of the Crop" subset, reaching a 62% positive consensus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/batman_begins/?critic=creamcrop|title=Batman Begins: Rotten Tomatoes' Cream of the Crop|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=2007-09-09}}</ref> By comparison, [[Metacritic]] calculated an average score of 70 from the 41 reviews it collected.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/batmanbegins|title=Batman Begins (2005): Reviews|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=2007-09-09}}</ref>

[[James Berardinelli]] applauded Nolan and Goyer's work creating more understanding into "who [Batman] is and what motivates him", something Berardinelli felt Tim Burton's film lacked; at the same time, Berardinelli felt the romantic aspect between Bale and Holmes did not work because the actors lacked the chemistry [[Christopher Reeve]] and [[Margot Kidder]] (''[[Superman (film)|Superman]]''), or [[Tobey Maguire]] and [[Kirsten Dunst]] (''[[Spider-Man (film)|Spider-Man]]'') shared in their respective roles.<ref>{{cite news|author=[[James Berardinelli|Berardinelli, James]]|url=http://www.reelviews.net/movies/b/batman_begins.html|title=Reel View's review of ''Batman Begins''|work=Reel Views|accessdate=2007-08-28}}</ref> According to ''[[Total Film]]'', Nolan manages to create such strong characters and story that the third-act action sequences cannot compare to " the frisson of two people talking", and Katie Holmes and Christian Bale's romantic subplot has a spark "refreshingly free of Peter Parker/Mary Jane-style whining".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.totalfilm.com/cinema_reviews/batman_begins|title=Batman Begins - Film Review|work=[[Total Film]]|accessdate=2007-09-13}}</ref>

''[[Los Angeles Times]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> [[Kenneth Turan]], who felt the film began slowly, stated that the "story, psychology and reality, not special effects", assisted the darkness behind Batman's arsenal; he noted that Neeson and Holmes, unlike Bale's ability to "feel his role in his bones", do not appear to fit their respective characters in "being both comic-book archetypes and real people".<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Kenneth Turan|Turan, Kenneth]]|url=http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/turan/cl-et-batman14jun14,0,4819786.story|title=Los Angeles Times reviews ''Batman Begins''|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2005-06-14|accessdate=2007-09-04}}</ref> ''[[The New Yorker]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[David Denby]] did not share Berardinelli and Turan's opinion. He was unimpressed with the film, when comparing it to the two [[Tim Burton]] films, and that Christian Bale's presence was hindered by the "dull earnestness of the screenplay", the final climax was "cheesy and unexciting", and that Nolan had resorting to imitating the "fakery" used by other filmmakers when filming action sequences.<ref>{{cite news|author=[[David Denby (film critic)|Denby, David]]|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/06/13/050613crci_cinema|title=Aiming Low|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=2005-06-05|accessdate=2007-08-27}}</ref>

Michael Wilmington of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' believed Nolan and Miller managed to "comfortably mix the tormented drama and revenge motifs with light hearted gags and comic book allusions", and that Nolan takes the series out of the "slam-bang Hollywood jokefests" the franchise had drifted into.<ref>{{cite news|author=Wilmington, Michael|url=http://chicago.metromix.com/movies/review/movie-review-batman-begins/159537/content|title=Movie review: 'Batman Begins'|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=2007-09-13}}</ref> Comic book scribe and editor [[Dennis O'Neil]] stated that he "felt the filmmakers really understood the character they were translating", citing this film as the best of the live-action Batman films.<ref>{{cite news|author=Bray, Greg|url=http://www.batman-on-film.com/interview_dennyoneil_gbray_2006.html|title=Interview: DENNY O'NEIL|work=Batman On Film|date=2006-10-18|accessdate=2007-08-27}}</ref> In contrast, J.R.

Giving it four out of four stars, he commended the realistic portrayals of the Batman arsenal—the Batsuit, Batcave, Batmobile, and the Batsignal—as well as the focus on "the story and character" with less stress on "high-tech action".<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Roger Ebert|Ebert, Roger]]|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050613/REVIEWS/50525003/1023|title=Ebert reviews ''Batman Begins''|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=2005-06-13|accessdate=2007-08-27}}</ref>

Like Berardinelli, ''[[USA Today]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Mike Clark thought Bale performed the role of Batman as well as he did Patrick Bateman in ''[[American Psycho (film)|American Psycho]]'', but that the relationship between Bruce Wayne and Rachel Dawes was "frustratingly  underdeveloped".<ref>{{cite news|author=Clark, Mike|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/reviews/2005-06-13-batman-begins_x.htm|title=Batman role fits Bale, but 'Begins' wears thin|work=[[USA Today]]|date=2005-06-13|accessdate=2007-08-28}}</ref> [[Kyle Smith]] thought Bale exhibited "both the menace and the wit he showed in his brilliant turn in ''American Psycho''", and that the film works so well because of the realism, stating, "Batman starts stripping away each layer of Gotham crime only to discover a sicker and more monstrous evil beneath, his rancid city simultaneously invokes early ’90s New York, when criminals frolicked to the tune of five murders a day; ''[[Serpico]]'' New York, when cops were for sale; and today, when psychos seek to kill us all at once rather than one by one."<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Kyle Smith|Smith, Kyle]]|url=http://kylesmithonline.com/?p=349|title=Kyle Smith review of ''Batman Begins''|work=KyleSmithOnline|date=2007-03-10|accessdate=2007-09-09}}</ref> In contrast, [[Salon.com]]'s Stephanie Zacharek felt Nolan did not deliver the emotional depth expected of "one of the most soulful and tortured superheroes of all"; she thought Bale, unlike Michael Keaton who she compared him to, failed to connect with the audience underneath the mask, but that Gary Oldman succeeds in "emotional complexity" where the rest of the movie fails.<ref>{{cite news|author=Zacharek, Stephanie|url=http://dir.salon.com/story/ent/movies/review/2005/06/15/batman_begins/index.html|title=Salon reviews ''Batman Begins''|work=[[Salon.com]]|date=2005-06-15|accessdate=2007-09-09}}</ref> However, [[Tim Burton]] felt Nolan "captured the real spirit that these kind of movies are supposed to have nowadays. When I did ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' twenty years ago, in 1988 or something, it was a different time in comic book movies. You couldn't go into that dark side of comics yet.
