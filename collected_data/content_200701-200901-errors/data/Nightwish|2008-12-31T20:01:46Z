'''Nightwish''' is a Finnish [[symphonic metal|symphonic]] [[power metal]] band, formed in 1996 in [[Kitee]], [[Finland]]. The band has sold more than 4 million albums as well as DVDs.<ref>[http://www.nightwish.com/en/biography Nightwish.com - Biography]</ref>

Although Nightwish has been prominent in their home country since the release of their first [[Single (music)|single]], “[[The Carpenter]]” (1997) and debut album ''[[Angels Fall First]]'', they did not achieve worldwide fame until the release of the albums ''[[Oceanborn]]'', ''[[Wishmaster (album)|Wishmaster]]'' and ''[[Century Child]]'', which were released in 1998, 2000 and 2002 respectively. Their 2004 album, ''[[Once (Nightwish album)|Once]]'', which sold more than 1 million copies,<ref name="dpprelease">{{cite web | title=Spinefarm | work=Nightwish | url=http://www.spinefarm.fi/showband.php?id=1 | accessmonthday=September 5 | accessyear=2008}}</ref> led to Nightwish video clips being shown on [[MTV]] in the [[United States]] and inclusion of their music in US movie soundtracks. Their biggest US hit single, “[[Wish I Had an Angel]]” (2004), made it onto three US film soundtracks as a means to promote their North American tour.<ref name="imdb">{{cite web | title=IMDb | work=Nightwish | url=http://imdb.com/name/nm1743752/ | accessmonthday=June 17 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> The band produced three more singles and two music videos for the album, as well as “[[Sleeping Sun]]”, from the 2005 “[[Greatest hits|best of]]” compilation album, ''[[Highest Hopes]]'', prior to vocalist [[Tarja Turunen]]’s dismissal.

In May 2007, former [[Alyson Avenue]] frontwoman, [[Anette Olzon]], was revealed as [[Tarja Turunen|Turunen]]’s replacement,<ref name="blabber">{{cite web | title=BLABBERMOUTH.NET | work=NIGHTWISH Announces New Singer | url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=73176 | accessmonthday=June 17 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> and in the autumn, the band released a new album ''[[Dark Passion Play]]'', which has sold nearly 1.8 million copies.<ref name="dpprelease">{{cite web | title=Nightwish – The Official Website | work=The Band – Discography.

== History ==
===''Nightwish demo'' (1996)===
After playing [[musical keyboard|keyboards]] in several heavy metal bands in the 1990s, including for example [[Nattvindens Gråt]] and [[Darkwoods My Betrothed]], [[Tuomas Holopainen]] decided to create his own project while sitting around a campfire with friends in 1996.<ref>Once Upon a Nightwish: Official Biography 1996 - 2006</ref> He immediately had a clear idea of the music: experimentally acoustic music he wrote by himself, similar to the music usually played around campfires, but with a distinct sound of atmosphere, played on his keyboards.

He soon invited friend and schoolmate  [[Emppu Vuorinen|Erno "Emppu" Vuorinen]] to play [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic guitar]]s, and the classical vocalist [[Tarja Turunen]], who had the same music teacher as they, Plamen Dimov. The three musicians recorded their self-titled acoustic [[Demo (music)|demo]] in the winter of 1996. The name “Nightwish” was derived from the first song the band recorded together, and the demo also included the song “The Forever Moments”, and an early version of “Etiäinen”.

After recording the ''Nightwish demo'', Holopainen decided that Turunen’s operatic voice was too powerful for an acoustic band, and decided to add in [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] elements, including electric guitars and drums.<ref name="Official Biography">{{cite web | title=Nightwish.com official biography| work= | url=http://nightwish.com/en/band/biography | accessmonthday=January 27 |accessyear=2008}}</ref>

===''Angels Fall First'' (1997)===
{{main|Angels Fall First}}

In early 1997, following the release of the ''Nightwish demo'', [[Jukka Nevalainen|Jukka “Julius” Nevalainen]] joined the band, and acoustic guitar was replaced with [[electric guitar]]. The addition of  [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] elements to the band's existing experimental style gave the band a unique sound, forming the core of the Nightwish sound.

The band entered the studio in April 1997 to record seven songs for their second demo, entitled ''Angels Fall First''. As a precursor to their debut full length album of the same name, the demo made its way to the Finnish record label [[Spinefarm Records]] in May 1997. The label signed Nightwish to a two album deal, and the band returned to the studio to re-record songs from their second demo. The full length album ''Angels Fall First'' was released internationally in November 1997 and reached number 31 on the Finnish album charts, with the single “[[The Carpenter]]” reaching number 3 on the Finnish singles chart. “The Carpenter” single was released as a split with label mates [[Children of Bodom]] and [[Thy Serpent]].

''Angels Fall First'' is one of the two albums which features keyboardist [[Tuomas Holopainen]]'s vocals, appearing on four of the album's eleven tracks, alongside vocalist Tarja Turunen. 

Critical reception of ''Angels Fall First'' was mixed, with [[Allmusic]] rating the album 2 out of 5 stars,<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web | title=allmusic | work=Angels Fall First | url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:lza9qj1qojfa | accessmonthday=January 1 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> and ''The Metal Observer'' stating that Nightwish’s debut album “paled drastically in comparison to their later work".<ref name="metalobsv">{{cite web | title=The Metal Observer | work=Review – Nightwish – Angels Fall First | url=http://www.metal-observer.com/articles.php?lid=1&sid=1&id=2621 | accessmonthday=January 1 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

In December 1997, after over a year of existence, Nightwish made their live debut in their hometown [[Kitee]], [[Finland]]. Since they were missing a bass player, [[Samppa Hirvonen]] joined them as a sessional live member. [[Marjaana Pellinen]] were also a sessoinal live member on [[Keyboard instrument|additional keyboard]] and [[backing vocalist]] for Tarja.  They were thinking about making Samppa Hirvonen a real member until they met [[Sami Vänskä]] in 1998.  During the winter of 1997 and 1998, the band performed only seven times, due to Nevalainen and Vuorinen’s obligatory Finnish military service, and Turunen finishing her schooling.

Following a string of live shows in Finland, the band filmed their first video clip for “The Carpenter” in April 1998. Nightwish completed their touring line up in the summer of 1998 when [[Bass guitar|bassist]] [[Sami Vänskä]], an old friend of Holopainen, joined the band. Nightwish then returned to the studio in August 1998 as a five-piece, to record their follow up album for Spinefarm records.

On October 7, 1998, Nightwish released their second full length album, ''Oceanborn'', in Finland only.   Adopting a more technical and progressive sound than ''Angels Fall First'',<ref name="jamesbyrd">{{cite web | title=James Byrd Tribute | work=Nightwish – Oceanborn | url=http://www.geocities.com/byrdtribute/nightwishocean.html | accessmonthday=December 27 |accessyear=2005}}</ref> ''Oceanborn'' saw the band abandon much of the ambient and folk elements present on their debut release, the only folk song is "Moondance". In contrast to the female vocals of Turunen, the album also featured guest growling vocals by [[Tapio Wilska]] (ex-[[Finntroll]]). 

''Oceanborn'' was well received, with Allmusic writing that the album “as a whole works great”, with songs that are “very strong”.<ref name="AllOcean">{{cite web |author=Ravelin, Antti J. |title=''Oceanborn'' review |url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:gpfixq8kldte |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessmonthday=January 27 |accessyear=2008}}</ref> ''Oceanborn'' was an instant success in Finland, reaching number 5 on the Finnish album charts. The album’s first single, “[[Sacrament of Wilderness]]”, hit number 1 on the Finnish singles charts, where it stayed for several weeks.<ref name="Official Biography">{{cite web | title=Nightwish.com official biography| work=Nightwish – Oceanborn | url=http://nightwish.com/en/band/biography | accessmonthday=January 27 |accessyear=2008}}</ref> The album’s release was initially limited to Finland, but due to the success of “Sacrament of Wilderness”, Spinefarm released ''Oceanborn'' internationally in the spring of 1999.<ref name="Official Biography"/> 

In May 1999, Nightwish recorded the single “[[Sleeping Sun (Four Ballads of the Eclipse)]]”. In one month the single sold 15,000 copies in Germany alone. Following the band’s first international success, Nightwish was added as the opening band for [[Rage (band)|Rage]]’s 1999 European tour. Both the album ''Oceanborn'' and the single “Sacrament of Wilderness” were certified [[Gold album|gold]] in Finland in August 1999.<ref name="Official Biography"/>

===''Wishmaster'' (2000)===
{{main|Wishmaster (album)}}
While in the studio in early 2000 working on their third album, Nightwish was accepted in the [[Finland|Finnish]] [[2000 Eurovision Song Contest|Eurovision Song Contest]] with the song “[[Sleepwalker (Nightwish song)|Sleepwalker]]”. ({{audio| Nightwish-sleepwalker.ogg|sample}}) Despite winning the public vote, Nightwish eventually finished in second place, with the jury choosing local gospel singer [[Nina Åström]] to represent Finland.<ref name="Official Biography"/> 

In May 2000, Nightwish released their third studio album ''Wishmaster'' which debuted at #1 on the Finnish album charts, and following three weeks at number one, was certified gold in Finland.<ref name="Official Biography"/> 

Critical response to the album was mixed, with Allmusic citing the album as repetitive, and saying “as a whole album, it can be a little annoying, even frustrating”. However, German magazine ''[[Rock Hard (magazine)|Rock Hard]]'' declared ''Wishmaster'' “Album of the Month”, despite competing against long-awaited May releases from [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Bon Jovi]].

Following the release of ''Wishmaster'', Nightwish embarked on their first world tour, playing dates in South America, Mexico, Canada, and the first headlining European tour with [[Sinergy]] and [[Eternal Tears of Sorrow]]. In the summer the band returned to Europe, appearing at the  [[Wacken Open Air]] festival and the Biebop Metal Fest.

===''Over the Hills and Far Away EP'' (2001)===
{{main|Over the Hills and Far Away (album)}}
[[Image:Live From Wishes to Eternity.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Nightwish live at [[Tampere]], [[Finland]].]]
In 2001, Nightwish recorded a cover of [[Gary Moore]]’s “Over the Hills and Far Away” together with two new songs (“10th Man Down” and “Away”) and a remake of “[[Astral Romance]]” (from the ''Angels Fall First'' album) with [[Tony Kakko]] ([[Sonata Arctica]]) singing Tuomas' part. This was released as their first, and so far only, [[Extended play|EP]] - "[[Over the Hills and Far Away (album)|Over the Hills and Far Away]]".<ref name="officialdiscography">{{cite web | title=Nightwish.com | work=Discography | url=http://nightwish.com/en/band/releases/details?id=4 | accessmonthday=October 30 | accessyear=2008}}</ref>

The record also included guest performances by [[Tapio Wilska]] (ex-[[Finntroll]]) once again.<ref name="officialdiscography"/> They also released a [[VHS]], [[DVD]] and [[Compact disc|CD]] with live material recorded in a show in [[Tampere]], on [[December 29]], [[2000]]. All of these were entitled ''[[From Wishes to Eternity]]''.

Nightwish’s version of "Over the Hills and Far Away" was well received by fans, being a repeating part of the band’s live performances and featuring on several compilation albums as well as the ''[[End of an Era]]'' DVD released in 2006. However, the other new songs never had a great break-through nor has been re-released (unless 10th Man Down on the DVD "[[End of Innocence]]" with [[Marco Hietala]] (later permanent bass player and male vocalist) on male vocals.

Soon after the release, Nightwish met what's been described as one of their hardest points as a band. The problem mostly relied on the bassist, [[Sami Vänskä]] who had started misbehaving towards the band by, for example, missing appointments and failing to take gigs as seriously as the other members would. After the band discussed this with Vänskä several times, without change, everyone simply stopped caring and tensions grew.<ref name="OUaN">Once Upon a Nightwish: Official Biography 1996 - 2006</ref>

Meanwhile, guitarist [[Emppu Vuorinen]] had started complaining about his role in the band, feeling like "a hired gun who would only do what he's asked to". According to their music teacher, Plamen Dimov, he and Holopainen were totally different characters, and thus difficulties were expected to arise. But Vuorinen was told to stay cool and "bite the bullet", and no more was spoken about the problem.<ref name="OUaN"/>
[[Image:Nightwish live 2001.jpg|thumb|225px|left|Nightwish live in 2001.]]
Soon, Holopainen seriously started thinking about breaking Nightwish up. After a gig in Russia, he sent a text message to fellow musician [[Tony Kakko]] of power metal band [[Sonata Arctica]], telling him that he did not think he had a band any longer, and asked him what plans he had for next year. After Nightwish' last gig for the ''Over the Hills and Far Away'' tour in 2001, Holopainen called [[Drakkar]] and [[Spinefarm Records|Spinefarm]], unofficially declaring Nightwish over. He told them he might produce another album, but he would never perform another show with the band. The same message was also written on the band's message board.<ref name="OUaN"/>

Straight after the last gig, Holopainen went on a week-long hiking trip to Lapland with Tony Kakko feeling relieved after finally breaking Nightwish up, albeit only unofficially. But during the hiking trip, something obviously happened and even though they barely discussed the matter alone in the wilderness, they both understood he could not break up Nightwish that easily. When he returned from Lapland he immediately received a phone call from Ewo Pohjola offering himself to become their manager and help him straighten things up. And Holopainen agreed.<ref name="OUaN"/>

In order to continue with Nightwish, Holopainen decided there had to be changes.  Apart from agreeing for Ewo to become their new manager, he also decided to ask [[Sami Vänskä]] to leave the band.  [[Marco Hietala]] ([[Tarot (band)|Tarot]] and [[Sinergy]]) was asked to join the band, effectively leaving Sinergy. As well as playing bass guitar, Hietala would also perform male vocals. Earlier, as required, either Holopainen (on the ''Angels Fall First'' album) or a guest musician performed the male vocals. Holopainen has since said publically that he and Vänskä still keep in touch, contrary to rumours saying that they have not met since. However, they are not interested in making another project together.<ref name="nightmailnovember06">{{cite web | title=Nightwish.com | work=Nightmail, November 2006 | url=http://nightwish.com/en/community/nightmail?month=11&year=2006 | accessmonthday=October 30 | accessyear=2008}}</ref>

===''Century Child'' (2002–2003)===
{{main|Century Child}}

In 2002, Nightwish released ''Century Child'', along with the singles “[[Ever Dream]]” and “[[Bless the Child (song)|Bless the Child]]”. The main difference from previous albums is the use of a live [[orchestra]] from Finland on “Bless the Child”, “Ever Dream”, “Feel For You” and “The Beauty of the Beast”, to get a more present feeling of [[European classical music|classical music]]. An enduring favorite of fans, though, is the band’s version of “[[The Phantom of the Opera]]”, from the famous musical of the same name by composer [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]. The song was repeatedly played on concerts until vocalist [[Tarja Turunen]] was replaced with [[Anette Olzon]], whereupon the band announced that they would never play the song live again.

''Century Child'' was certified gold two hours after its release, and platinum two weeks afterwards. It set a record on the Finnish album charts as well; never before had the second been so distant from the first place. After the “[[Bless the Child (song)|Bless the Child]]” video, a second one was recorded, without any single support. The chosen track was “[[End of All Hope]]”. The clip contains pieces from the Finnish movie, ''[[Kohtalon kirja]]'' (English: ''The Book of Fate'').<ref name="kohtalon">{{cite web | title=Kohtalon Kirja | work=Kohtalon Kirja DVD | url=http://www.kohtalonkirja.com/dvd | accessmonthday=December 30 | accessyear=2005}}</ref>

In 2003, Nightwish released their second DVD, entitled ''[[End of Innocence]]''. The DVD tells the story of the band in Holopainen, Nevalainen and Tapio Wilska’s words for two hours. The documentary also features bits of live concerts, exclusive footage, etc.

[[Singer|Vocalist]] [[Tarja Turunen]] also got married during the summer of 2003, and there were rumours that the band was about to be dissolved. These rumours were, at the time, proven to be false, as the band continued to play concerts for another year and released another album. The marriage was later to play a part in Tarja’s dismissal from the band in the autumn of 2005.

===''Once'' (2004–2005)===

{{main|Once (Nightwish album)}}

[[Image:NightwishJune2005.jpg|thumb|210px|Nightwish live in June 2005, during their “Once World Tour”.]]

A new album entitled ''Once'' was released on [[June 7]], [[2004]], along with their first single, “[[Nemo (song)|Nemo]]” (Latin: “No one”), from that album. The single topped the charts in Finland and [[Hungary]], and reached the top ten in five additional countries. “Nemo” therefore remains the band's most successful single release to date.

With ''Once'', Nightwish started to produce [[orchestra|orchestral versions]] of some of their songs. Songs that so far have been produced as orchestral versions include “Nemo”, “[[Ghost Love Score]]”, “[[Eva (song)|Eva]]” and “[[Amaranth (song)|Amaranth]]”.

''Once'' utilizes a full orchestra in nine of the eleven songs on the album. Unlike ''Century Child'', Nightwish decided to look for an orchestra outside of Finland this time, choosing the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]]. It is also their second album to feature a full-length song in Finnish, “[[Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan|Kuolema tekee taiteilijan]]” (English: “Death Makes an Artist”). ''Once'' has sold triple platinum in Finland, platinum in [[Germany]], gold in [[Sweden]] and reached #1 in the [[Greece|Greek]], [[Norway|Norwegian]] and Hungarian album charts. The following singles were: “[[Wish I Had an Angel]]” (featured on the soundtrack of the film ''[[Alone in the Dark (2005 film)|Alone in the Dark]]''), “[[Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan]]” (released only in Finland and [[Japan]]) and “[[The Siren (song)|The Siren]]”. Besides the commercial success, ''Once'' was also accepted by critics, with many positive reviewers drawing comparisons with ''Oceanborn''.

The success of the album allowed them to perform the ''Once World Tour'', which enabled them to play in many countries the band had never visited before. Nightwish performed at the opening ceremony of the [[2005 World Championships in Athletics]], held in [[Helsinki]], highlighting acclaim the band has recently gained.

A “best of” album was released in September 2005, containing songs from their whole discography. The compilation is entitled ''[[Highest Hopes]]'', also featuring a live cover of [[Pink Floyd]]’s song “[[High Hopes (Pink Floyd song)|High Hopes]]” (from the ''[[The Division Bell]]'' album) ([[Media:Nightwish-highhopes.ogg|sample]]). Besides ''High Hopes'', a remake of “[[Sleeping Sun]]” (from ''Oceanborn'') was put on the album, which was also released as a single. A new video for “Sleeping Sun” was shot, featuring a [[medieval]] battle, and can be found on the German release of the single and as a separate DVD released by Spinefarm.

===''End of an Era'' (2005–2006)===
{{main|End of an Era}}
[[Image:Nightwish End of an Era.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The last show with Tarja Turunen, titled ''End of an Era'', at Finland.]]
After the recording in the [[Hartwall Areena]] (Helsinki) on [[October 21]], [[2005]], of the new live DVD ''End of an Era'' (released June 2006), the four other members of Nightwish decided that it was best to continue Nightwish without Tarja Turunen,<ref name="wikisource">{{cite web | publisher=Wikisource | title=Open letter to Tarja Turunen | url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Open_Letter_To_Tarja_Turunen | accessmonthday=October 23 |accessyear=2005}}</ref> a feeling they expressed through an [[open letter]] which was given to Turunen by Tuomas Holopainen after the concert, and afterwards posted on the band’s website. It was written by Holopainen but signed by the other band members. The main justification of Turunen’s dismissal given in the letter was that the band felt that both her husband Marcelo Cabuli (an Argentine businessman) and [[Commercialism|commercial]] interests had changed her attitude towards the band. 

Turunen responded to the incident twice, during a press conference in Finland and in Germany, saying that her dismissal came entirely as a shock to her, given that she had not been notified before the letter was given to her. She felt that the personal attacks on her husband were unwarranted, and that playing the issue out to the public was “senselessly cruel”. She expressed these feelings through her own open letter, which was published on her personal website,<ref name="tarjaturunena">{{cite web | publisher=METALYOU.COM | title=Tarja Turunen Letter to the band, fans and media | url=http://www.metalyou.com/band/nightwish/news/nightwish_tarja_turunen_letter_to_the_band_fans_and_media/ | accessmonthday=August 16 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> and through various TV, magazine, and newspaper interviews.

Since, Turunen has focused on her own solo career, however she is still often covering Nightwish songs on live concerts.

===''Dark Passion Play'' (2006–2008)===

{{main|Dark Passion Play}}
[[Image:Nightwish-Melbourne-2008.jpg|thumb|220px|right|The "Dark Passion Play World Tour" at Melbourne, in 2008.]]

In September of 2006, the band entered the studio to record their sixth studio album, entitled "[[Dark Passion Play]]".<ref name="NWofficialnews"> {{cite web | title=Nightwish.com | work=News | url=http://nightwish.com/en/news/ | accessmonthday=December 19 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> In order to find a replacement for Turunen as the female vocalist of the band, on [[March 17]], [[2006]] the band allowed vocalists interested for the position to send in demo tapes as an audition for the spot. During this time, speculation began to emerge as to who would eventually be chosen. In April 2007, the heavy metal magazine [[Terrorizer]] as an [[April Fools]] joke reported that [[Sarah Brightman]] would be the new vocalist. In response to this and other rumors, the band stated on their website that fans should not believe any source other than the band itself for information regarding the new vocalist.<ref name="NWofficialnews"/> Other rumours also mentioned that [[Vibeke Stene]], the former singer of the [[gothic metal]] band [[Tristania (band)|Tristania]], would join Nightwish. For the same reason, the identity of the new singer was to be published earlier, and on Thursday 24 May, the 35-year-old [[Alyson Avenue]] lead singer [[Anette Olzon]] from [[Katrineholm]], [[Sweden]] was announced to replace Turunen.<ref name="NWofficialnews"/> The replacement of the lead vocalist has led to many fans calling the band 'new' Nightwish, whilst referring to the songs sung by Turunen as 'old' Nightwish. Holopainen has said in interviews he did not wish to reveal her identity until new material was available because he did not want fans judging her by nothing more than a picture, or past work.

{{Wikinews|Nightwish release 'Dark Passion Play', most expensive album in Finnish history?}}

The day after this revealing, [[May 25]], 2007, charity single “[[Eva (song)|Eva]]” was released as the first off the album, as download only. It was originally scheduled for release on [[May 30]] but this was changed due to a leak on a British music download site. This was the first published song to feature Olzon. On [[June 13]], Nightwish released the title, ''Dark Passion Play'', and artwork to the new album on their official website, as well as the name and the cover of the second single (this time CD), “[[Amaranth (song)|Amaranth]]”. The single, that first was released in Finland on [[August 22]], included a bonus track entitled “[[While Your Lips Are Still Red]]” written by Tuomas as the main theme track for the upcoming Finnish feature film “Lieksa!”. Technically, it is not a Nightwish-track as it only features [[Marco Hietala]] on vocals and acoustic bass, [[Tuomas Holopainen]] on keys and [[Jukka Nevalainen]] on drums. The song’s video was officially released on [[June 15]]. “Amaranth” achieved gold status in Finland after less than two days in stores.

''Dark Passion Play'' was released around Europe in the last week of September, 2007, in the UK on October 1st, and the United States on October 2nd. In this album, male vocalist [[Marco Hietala]] achieves more freedom in his vocals, singing at least back up in every single song of the album with the exceptions of “Eva” and “Amaranth”, singing lead vocals in several songs, such as “[[The Islander (song)|The Islander]]”, “Master Passion Greed” and “[[While Your Lips Are Still Red]]”, and singing chorus in songs such as “[[Bye Bye Beautiful]]” and “7 Days to the Wolves”.<ref name="NWofficialnews"/>

Several magazines, including ''Kerrang!'' have noted how the departure of Tarja Turunen seems to have released the band from their shell and how restraint has been left to other bands. The use of some 175 additional musicians for the orchestral and solo parts of the album has resulted in the band now being described as symphonic metal – especially in 14 minute album opener “The Poet and The Pendulum”. The album was awarded 5/5 (classic) by ''Kerrang!'' magazine.<ref>Kerrang!</ref>

On [[September 22]], [[2007]], the band hosted a secret concert at Rock Café in [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]], disguising itself as a Nightwish [[cover band]] called “Nachtwasser”.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=81338|title=Nightwish performs secret gig in Estonia|date=September 23, 2007|accessdate=2007-10-07}}</ref> Their first official concert with the new singer was in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]] on [[October 6]], [[2007]].<ref>{{cite news|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=82280|title=Nightwish performs first official concert with new singer|date=October 7, 2007|accessdate=2007-10-07}}</ref> The ''Dark Passion Play'' tour thus started, visiting the [[United States]], [[Canada]], most of [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[Australia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nightwish.com/en/band/tour|title=Nightwish – Tour Info|publisher=Nightwish.com|accessdate=2007-10-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=82169|title=Nightwish Australian tour dates announced|date=October 5, 2007|accessdate=2007-10-07}}</ref>

The third single of the album was “[[Erämaan Viimeinen]]”, a previously unreleased vocal version of the instrumental song “Last of the Wilds”. It was released in Finland only on [[December 5]], [[2007]]. On this song, Jonsu of the Finnish [[pop music|pop]]/[[rock music|rock]] band [[Indica (Finnish band)|Indica]] performs the Finnish vocals.<ref name="NWofficialnews"/> “[[Bye Bye Beautiful]]”, the fourth single, was released on [[February 15]], [[2008]], and concerns the 2005 dismissal of Turunen, as do two other songs on the album (The Poet and the Pendulum and Master Passion Greed). The single includes yet another bonus track, "Escapist", which is also included on the Japanese version of Dark Passion Play.<ref name="nwshop">{{cite web | title=Nwshop.fi | work=Nightwish-Shop | url=http://www.nwshop.fi/productinfo.cfm?tuotenumero=196964&from=startpage&lang=en | accessmonthday=October 30 | accessyear=2008}}</ref> Within a week after the release, the fifth single was announced to be “[[The Islander (song)|The Islander]]”. “The Islander” featured an orchestral version of the epic ballad "Meadows of Heaven" and also included an instrumental version of "Escapist" and a new edit version of "The Islander" itself. It was released over a month after the release of its music video, shot in late 2007 in [[Rovaniemi]] in the Finnish [[Lapland]]. Holopainen described the video as "the Lapp wilderness meets the surrealism of [[Salvador Dalí]]".<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F2BqFDYWVU Youtube - Tuomas Holopainen interview]</ref> He also said that the lyrics actually for once goes hand in hand with the video's storyline.

The Dark Passion Play tour turned out to be Nightwish' longest tour yet, lasting from the fall of 2007 to the spring of 2009<ref name="toumasholopainennet">{{cite web | title=TuomasHolopainen.net | work=Interview | url=http://www.tuomasholopainen.net/int-thnet2.html | accessmonthday=October 30 | accessyear=2008}}</ref>. 

On March 3, 2008, Nightwish lost by a single vote to the American power metal band [[Kamelot]], in the Metal Storm Awards 2007. Both Nightwish and Kamelot were among the nominees for Best Power Metal Album of 2007 (''Dark Passion Play'', and ''[[Ghost Opera]]'' respectively). They suffered another loss to Kamelot in the category for Best Music Video, their nominated video being for the song “Amaranth”. They, however won Biggest Surprise of 2007.

In August, Nightwish announced that the album will be followed by a photobook, entitled ''Dark Passion Gallery'', with photos by Finnish photographer Ville Akseli Juurikkala and with captions by the band members, as well as a [[foreword]] by Holopainen.<ref>[http://nightwish.com/en/photobook Nightwish.com - Dark Passion Gallery]</ref> The photobook will be released on October 22.<ref>[http://nightwish.com/en/news/ Nightwish.com - News]</ref>

===Made in Hong Kong and planned new album (2008-)===
In July, 2008, Holopainen claimed that he has started working on Nightwish's seventh studio album<ref>[http://nightwish.com/en/community/nightmail?month=07&year=2008 Nightwish.com - Nightmail (July 2008)]</ref>, probably to be released in late 2010 or early 2011{{Fact|date=December 2008}}. Holopainen will start working full time on the album sometime in 2009, after their ''Dark Passion Play'' tour has ended in the spring.

In October, [[Marco Hietala|Hietala]], who is the writer of "The Islander" and co-writer of several songs (eg. "7 Days to the Wolves", "Romanticide", "Higher than Hope") on ''Dark Passion Play'' and ''Once'' , said he has got material ready for their next album, but it "has to go through Tuomas' filter first".<ref>[http://nightwish.com/en/community/nightmail?month=09&year=2008 Nightwish.com - Nightmail (October 2008)]</ref>

In November, Nightwish announced that they are to release a new live [[MCD]]/[[DVD]] in March 2009, entitled "[[Made in Hong Kong (And Various Other Places)]]", and it was recorded during the "[[Dark Passion Play]] World Tour" in 2007 - 2008. It will feature a bonus-DVD with material from Israel to South-America, directed by Ville Lipiäinen. The tracklisting and release date is still unconfirmed.<ref>[http://www.nightwish.com/en/news - News (December 11, 2008)]</ref>

==Music==
===Lyrical themes===
[[Image:PitandthePendulum-Clarke.jpg|170px|thumb|right|“The Poet and the Pendulum” is inspired by the [[Edgar Allan Poe]] story ''[[The Pit and the Pendulum]]''.]]

In the beginning, Holopainen mainly wrote on [[Mythology|mythological]] and [[fantasy]] themes,<ref>lancelot: [http://www.yopi.de/rev/206437 ''Nightwish: Oceanborn --> einfach genial!!!''] at Yopi.de, 11. Mai 2005 (German, viewed on  August 3, 2007)</ref> and often used references to "metaphysics and nature".<ref>Matthias Mineur: ''Nightwish. Suomi Superstars'' in ''EMP 4/99'', p. 26</ref> For example the song "Beauty and the Beast" is based upon [[Beauty and the Beast|the fairy tale]] as well as [[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|the Disney film]], "Elvenpath" is about fantasy in general with references to traditional stories as well as [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]. Through the years the lyrics became obviously more personal. On ''Wishmaster'', the title track is still a "tribute to Tolkien and all the other fantasy writers",<ref name="powermetal/00">Georg Weihrauch: [http://power-metal.de/interview/interview-27.html ''Interview Nightwish - Tuomas Holopainen''] at Power-Metal.de. November 12, 2000 (German, viewed on August 15, 2007)</ref>, but with "Dead Boy's Poem", the album also includes a very emotional piece, which Holopainen calls his "legacy and […] testament for the whole world. […] I wanted to do this song before I die, because I wanted to tell the whole world what I think and feel. It expresses a lot of myself."<ref name="powermetal/00" /> Other personal songs on the album are "Come Cover Me", a love song, and "She is My Sin", which deals with the [[male sexuality]].

The personal development became even more obvious on the ''Wishmaster''-successor ''[[Century Child]]''. Turunen thinks that the lyrics do not anymore deal "with the dreamland we were used to, but with the brutal reality of life."<ref>Tom Klaner: [http://www.bright-eyes.de/baseportal/Stories/interviewdetail&Id==386 ''NIGHTWISH''] at Bright-Eyes.de (German, viewed on August 3, 2007)</ref> "Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan" (eng. "Death Makes an Artist") from the ''Once'' album describes the experience of loss and its impact on art, "[[Nemo (song)|Nemo]]" deals with the feeling of being lost.<ref name="u-empire/holo">Klaudia Weber: [http://www.underground-empire.com/article.php?idx=611 ''Nightwish Interview''] at Underground-Empire.com (german, viewed on August 3, 2007)</ref>

In the opposite, "Creek Mary's Blood" is based on [[Dee Brown]]'s story of the same name, which presents the situation of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] at the end of the 19th century.<ref name="u-empire/holo" /> 2007's ''[[Dark Passion Play]]'' included an unusual amount of personal songs, including "The Poet and the Pendulum" which has been described as Holopainen's life story, and about being a composer and musician. Another song, "Meadows of Heaven" is a depiction of Holopainen's childhood and the feeling that it'll never return. Two songs, "[[Bye Bye Beautiful]]" and "Master Passion Greed" are about ex-member [[Tarja Turunen]] and her husband Marcelo Cabuli. Another song on the album, "Cadence of Her Last Breath", is a "very personal song" about running away.<ref>[http://tuomasholopainen.net/darkpassionplay.html TuomasHolopainen.net - Tuomas about the DPP tracks]</ref> Other songs also contain many references to authors such as [[Edgar Allan Poe]], Walt Withman and [[Stephen King]],<ref name="pm 7/07">Ricarda Schwoebel: [http://powermetal.de/interview/interview-1325.html ''Interview Nightwish - Anette, Tuomas''] at Powermetal.de, August 3, 2007 (German, viewed on November 4, 2007)</ref><ref>[http://tuomasholopainen.net/darkpassionplay.html TuomasHolopainen.net - Tuomas about the DPP tracks]</ref> but the album also features a return to the fantasy theme with songs such as "Sahara", "Whoever Brings the Night" and "7 Days to the Wolves".

===Language===
On their debut album ''Angels Fall First'', several songs were written in Finnish language, but since the band has only written songs in English, with the only exceptions being "Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan" from the ''Once'' album and the single "Erämaan Viimeinen" (2007), which is a version of the instrumental "Last of the Wilds" that features vocals. Holopainen thought that he was very uncertain about the lyrics of that song, because he is of the opinion that writing in Finnish is rather hard, and stated "Finnish [could] quickly sound really cheesy."<ref>Ricarda Schwoebel: [http://www.powermetal.de/interview/interview-1038.html ''Interview Nightwish - Tuomas Holopainen, Mape Ollila''] at Powermetal.de, Juli 14, 2006 (german, viewed on August 10, 2007)</ref> Olzon has stated in an interview that there's a possibility they will write one or two songs in [[Swedish]] in the future.{{Fact|date=December 2008}}

===Influence===
{{main|Tuomas Holopainen}}
Tuomas Holopainen, writer of most of the band’s lyrics and [[Sheet music|musical score]]s, says that he gets most of the inspiration for Nightwish’s songs from [[Film score|film music]].<ref name="tuomasprofile">{{cite web | title=Nightwish.com | work=Profile of Tuomas Holopainen | url=http://www.nightwish.com/en/band/members/facts?id=1 | accessmonthday=December 28 | accessyear=2005}}</ref> Songs like “Beauty of the Beast” (from ''[[Century Child]]''), “Ghost Love Score” (from ''[[Once (Nightwish album)|Once]]'') and “The Poet and the Pendulum” (from ''[[Dark Passion Play]]'') are examples of this influence. Other songs, such as “[[Bye Bye Beautiful]]” (from ''Dark Passion Play''), and “[[Wish I Had an Angel]]” (from ''Once'') have elements of [[industrial metal]], and some others, like “[[The Islander]]” and “Last of the Wilds” (from ''Dark Passion Play''), “[[Creek Mary's Blood]]” (from ''Once''), and the ''[[Angels Fall First]]'' album have elements of [[folk metal]]. Holopainen has also said that film music is the music he listens to for leisure.<ref name="tuomasprofile"/> He likes, for example, the musical scores to ''[[Van Helsing (film)|Van Helsing]]'' and ''[[Crimson Tide]]'', and practically everything written by [[Hans Zimmer]].<ref name="tuomasprofile"/> Holopainen has also stated that [[Children of Bodom]] is an influence.<ref>Once Upon a Nightwish: Official Biography 1996 - 2006</ref> 

Fantasy novels are also a big influence on Nightwish’s music. Many of the lyrics make fairly clear references to fantasy novels, especially the ''Dragonlance'' series and [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Songs such as “Wishmaster”  and “Wanderlust” seem to be heavily influenced by the novels. References to The Kharolis Mountains, 'Shalafi' and Krynn, as well as 'Elbereth' and 'Gray Havens', can be found in these songs. The music of “7 Days to the Wolves” is inspired by [[Stephen King]]’s ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]'' series.

On the other hand, Nightwish has also been noted as a source of inspiration for other bands. [[Simone Simons]], lead singer of [[The Netherlands|Dutch]] [[gothic metal#Symphonic gothic metal|symphonic/gothic metal]] band [[Epica (band)|Epica]], stated that she began singing due to Nightwish' 1998 ''[[Oceanborn]]'' album.<ref name="epica">{{cite web | title=Epica Online | work=Profile Simone | url=http://www.epica.nl/index.php?id=45&section=band | accessmonthday=December 28 | accessyear=2005}}</ref> Ex-singer of [[symphonic metal]] band [[Visions of Atlantis]], [[Nicole Bogner]], also acknowledged that Nightwish had greatly inspired them for their first album.<ref name="musdiscvisions">{{cite web | title=Musical Discoveries | work=Visions of Atlantis (Nicole Bogner) | url=http://www.musicaldiscoveries.com/reviews/voa.htm | accessmonthday=December 30 |accessyear=2005}}</ref> [[Sander Gommans]] of [[After Forever]] said that Nightwish “will certainly influence us in creating new songs”.<ref name="musdiscafter">{{cite web | title=Musical Discoveries | work=After Forever | url=http://www.musicaldiscoveries.com/reviews/aftfor.htm | accessmonthday=December 30 | accessyear=2005}}</ref> [[Power metal]] band [[Sonata Arctica]]’s lead singer [[Tony Kakko]] has explained how much of an influence Nightwish is to him.<ref name="gauntlet">{{cite web | title=The Gauntlet | work=Sonata Arctica Interview | url=http://euro.thegauntlet.com/interviews/1159/Sonata%20Arctica.html | accessmonthday=June 17 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

===Musical style===
[[Image:Tuomas Holopainen, Palais.jpg|thumb|right|The usage of [[musical keyboard|keyboard]] through traditional piano, power metal-style and to create a special atmosphere is an important part of Nightwish's original music.]]

Nightwish was early identified as pioneers in the field of female heavy metal vocalists, being laughed at in their early years as they followed bands such as [[The Gathering]] and [[Doro (band)|Doro]]<ref>Once Upon a Nightwish: Official Biography 1996 - 2006</ref>. According to Holopainen, the idea of Nightwish wasn't as brilliant as it may sound - to mix styles of female operatic vocals and metals - but it was a mere coincidence as Turunen was asked into the band while they still were an acoustic project, and then things developed by themselves. The usage of a female vocalist has however become a sort of trademark, though less so since the outbreak of new female fronted metal bands in the mid-2000s with the popularization of bands such as  [[Evanescence]], and [[Within Temptation]] and several gothic metal bands mixing female and male vocals, such as [[Tristania]], [[Epica (band)|Epica]] and the early [[Within Temptation]].

[[Image:Tarja Turunen at Obras Stadium 2008 09.jpg|thumb|left|An essential part of Nightwish' original sound was the soprano vocals of [[Tarja Turunen]], until her departure from the band in 2005.]]

==Live performances==
[[Image:Nightwish-2.jpg|thumb|left|Holopainen, Vuorinen and Hietala in a live concert in [[Melbourne]], 2008.]]
Having their first concert in hometown [[Kitee]] on December 31st, 1997, Nightwish has throughout the years grown as a live act, always with the attitude "the more gigs managed in a year, the better".<ref>[http://nightwish.com/en/community/nightmail Nightwish.com - Nightmail]</ref> Early in their career, Nightwish gained a bad reputation for not being "metal" enough. "As anyone can see from early photos, our image was pretty far from Rock'n'Roll", drummer [[Jukka Nevalainen]] explains their early days. "We all looked like ol' goody-goody nerds!".

As the band budget grew after the fame of ''[[Oceanborn]]'' and ''[[Wishmaster]]'', the live performances had more space and along with better arenas and a wilder crowd, they could also start the using more professional lighting and pyrotechnics, which are now standard for most shows. The band also developed on stage, with wilder metal-like appearances.<ref name="OUaN"/>

[[Image:Nightwish- palais.jpg|thumb|right|Hietala, Vuorinen, Olzon and Nevalainen on tour in 2008.]]

Their standard setlist has changed a lot through the years, but they have always tried mixing older songs with random ones from their latest album.<ref>[http://nightwish.com/en/community/nightmail Nightwish.com - Nightmail]</ref> For their Dark Passion Play and ''Once'' tourings, they have always finished with "[[Wish I Had an Angel]]", and (on ''Dark Plassion Play'' tourings alone) before that "Wishmaster" and "7 Days to the Wolves". During the ''Dark Passion Play'' tour, their standard setlist always included hit songs such as "[[Amaranth (song)|Amaranth]]", "[[Bye Bye Beautiful]]" and "[[Nemo (song)|Nemo]]". Every concert also includes the soft ballad "[[The Islander (song)|The Islander]]" halfway through, in which [[Anette Olzon]] can take a break for a few minutes. They usually include one more ballad as well, normally "[[Eva (song)|Eva]]" or "[[Sleeping Sun (Four Ballads of the Eclipse)|Sleeping Sun]]". They also have songs they only play on certain occasions: They only play "Creek Mary's Blood" when guest musician [[John Two-Hawks]] has the possibility to assist, "[[Erämaan Viimeinen|Last of the Wilds]]" only when Troy Donockley guest-plays on several instruments, and "Higher Than Hope" only when the family of Marc Brueland, who inspired the writing of the song, is present.<ref name="nightmailjuly2008">{{cite web | title=Nightwish.com | work=Nightmail, July 2008 | url=http://nightwish.com/en/community/nightmail?month=07&year=2008 | accessmonthday=November 11 | accessyear=2008}}</ref>

When Tarja Turunen still was a member of the band, the band usually played a cover with only Hietala on vocals halfway through the set, while Turunen could rest for about five minutes. Since her dismissal and Anette Olzon's joining, they usually play "The Islander" instead, in which Hietala has the main vocal part and Olzon joins in the end.
