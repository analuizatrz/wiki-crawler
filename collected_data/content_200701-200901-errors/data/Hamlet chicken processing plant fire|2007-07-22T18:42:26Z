The '''Hamlet chicken processing plant fire''' was an [[industrial disaster]] that took place at the Imperial Foods chicken processing plant in [[Hamlet, North Carolina|Hamlet]], [[North Carolina]],  [[USA]], on [[September 3]], [[1991]] after a failure in a faulty modification to a [[hydraulic line]]. Twenty-five people were killed and fifty-four injured in the fire as they were trapped behind locked fire doors. Due to a lack of inspectors, the plant had never received a [[safety inspection]] in eleven years of operation,<ref name="emergency.com"/> and it is thought that a single inspection would have easily prevented the tragedy.<ref name="officialreport"/>

A full [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] investigation was launched, which resulted in the owner receiving a 20-year [[prison]] [[Sentence (law)|sentence]], and the company received the highest fines ever handed out in the history of North Carolina.<ref name="fedlock"/> However, the investigation also highlighted failings in the authoritative enforcement of existing [[safety regulations]], and resulted in a number of worker safety laws being passed. Accusations of [[racism]] were leveled at both the fire service and the city of Hamlet in the aftermath of the fire. The latter dispute, concerning a memorial service organized by the city, resulted in two separate, near-identical monuments being erected. The plant was never reopened.

The fire remains the worst [[industrial disaster]] ever to strike North Carolina,<ref name="UnitVII"/> and the third worst American industrial disaster, with only the 1947 [[Texas City disaster]] and the 1911 [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]] being worse.<ref name="lessons"/> (Mining disasters are in a separate category. Fifty three miners died in 1925 in North Carolina in the [[Coal Glen mine disaster]].)

==Background==
[[Image:Imperial Plant Front.png|right|thumb|300px|A view of the front of the plant, taken shortly after the fire. The door to the right is the main office.]]
The Imperial Foods building was eleven years old, although the basic structure dated back to the early 1900s.<ref name="officialreport"/> The building had been used for various food processing applications and was previously an [[ice cream]] factory.<ref name="officialreport"/> At the time of the fire it had grown to include a series of adjoining structures totaling 30,000 square-feet.<ref name="UnitVII">{{cite web |url=http://www.eduref.org/Virtual/Lessons/crossroads/sec4/Unit_7/Unit_VIIQ10R3.html |title=Describe the working conditions in factories in the late 19th century - Imperial Foods Company Reading |accessdate=2007-01-31 |last=Paul Nowell |first=Fred Bayless, |format=HTML |work=eduref.org - Consisting of two articles originally published by the [[Associated Press]] on [[september 5]] [[1991]] and two by [[Time Magazine]]. }}</ref> The factory was constructed with bricks and metalwork and was a single story high.<ref name="officialreport"/> The interior was a "maze of large rooms separated by moveable walls"<ref name="UnitVII"/> and both workers and the product moved around the interior from process to process going from front to rear.<ref name="UnitVII"/> Imperial's owners usually kept the doors of the chicken plant padlocked and the windows boarded-up.<ref name="Organica">{{cite web |url=http://www.organicanews.com/news/article.cfm?story_id=103 |title=Hamlet: the Untold Tragedy | year =1995 |accessdate=2007-01-29 |format=HTML |work=Organica News }}</ref> This was done to prevent people from stealing chickens, vandalizing the premises and/or committing other petty criminal acts — a decision that was to later have fatal consequences. There had been no safety inspections by the state due to a lack of inspectors.<ref name="emergency.com"/> However, the poultry inspector had visited the site daily and was aware of the various fire violations as well as the fact that much of the chicken meat was found to be rotten, and that the reason it was processed into [[chicken nuggets]] was to disguise the foul taste. However, for unknown reasons, he did not report these violations.<ref name="Organica"/><ref name="lessons">{{cite news |first=Patrik |last=Jonsson |title=Lessons from a factory fire |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0203/p02s01-usgn.html |work=The Christian Science Monitor |date=2003-02-03 |accessdate=2007-01-30 }}</ref> Some workers were made nervous by the locked doors but did not voice their concerns for fear of losing their jobs.<ref name="UnitVII"/>

The company always had a poor safety record although it had had no previous fatal accidents. It was cited in the 1980s after safety violations in its plant at [[Moosic]], [[Pennsylvania]] were discovered. These included poorly marked or blocked emergency exits.<ref name="safety record">{{cite news |title=Company in Fatal Fire Cited in Third State |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEEDD1138F935A2575AC0A967958260 |work=The [[New York Times]] |publisher= |date=1991-09-16 |accessdate=2007-02-02 }}</ref> The offending factory had been closed by the time of the fire. The factory had three previous non-fatal fires but despite this no action was taken to prevent recurrence or to unlock the doors.<ref name="Organica"/> The plant had been hit by fires before Imperial took over as well, although these, too, were non-fatal.<ref name="officialreport"/> Also, the Imperial plant at [[Cumming, Georgia|Cumming]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] had two major fires, one of which, in 1989, caused $1.2 million worth of damage.<ref name="safety record"/> The plant in Hamlet had been hit by fires before Imperial took over as well, although these, too, were non-fatal.<ref name="officialreport"/>

This particular plant was also less than ideal. The plant tended to have a workload of one hundred chickens a minute. This high rate of speed created large currents of air which kept temperatures low via the "[[wind chill]]" effect. This, combined with refrigerated working conditions, lead to many workers contracting [[parrot fever]], a type of [[pneumonia]].<ref name="WisCOSH">{{cite web |url=http://www.wiscosh.org/work.htm |title=Work : It Can Be dangerous to Your Health |accessdate=2007-02-02 |format=HTML |work=Wisconsin Committee on Occupational Safety and Health }}</ref> There was also a high rate of repetitive motion injuries and an average of 23% of workers fell seriously ill or were badly injured every year.<ref name="WisCOSH"/> There were no [[sprinkler]]s in the building,<ref name="Organica"/> which also contained a quantity of [[asbestos]] and had no [[fire alarm]] system to warn workers further back in the plant.<ref name="no fire alarm">{{cite news |title=Chicken Plant Operators Indicted |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10616FD3A5A0C738DDDAA0894DA494D81 |work=The [[New York Times]]  |date=1992-10-03 |accessdate=2007-02-02 }}</ref><ref name="Organica"/>

There was a general lack of flammable materials throughout the complex, other than some packing materials towards the rear, and as a result an extensive fire was considered unlikely.<ref name="officialreport"/> As a result there were open spaces between rooms in place of doors to allow for easy access by [[forklift truck]]s. The only barrier to any of these was curtains of plastic strips between some to hold in refrigerated air.<ref name="officialreport"/> This allowed for rapid spread of smoke and heat in the deadly blaze. Also, the building's previous use as an ice cream production facility meant that the walls and floor were hard, smooth surfaces, which would severely limit the amount of material that was available to absorb heat and smoke during the fire.<ref name="officialreport"/>

==Fire==
[[Image:Imperial Foods Cooker 1.png|right|thumb|300px|A view of the cooker vat where the fire started.]]
There were ninety employees in the facility at the time of the fire, which began when a twenty-five [[foot (unit of length)|foot]] long [[deep fryer|deep fat fryer]] [[vat]] apparently [[spontaneous combustion|spontaneously ignited]] at around 8:30 AM.<ref name="emergency.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.emergency.com/nc-fire.htm |title=Fire Violations Kill Twenty-Five In Chicken Plant |accessdate=2007-01-18 |format=HTML |work=emergency.com }}</ref> This cooker was temperature controlled via thermostat and was maintained at a constant 375 degrees [[fahrenheit]] (190°C), which was variable by design to fifteen degrees fahrenheit either way.<ref name="officialreport"/> The fire spread rapidly, causing trauma-related injuries to some of the survivors as they rushed to escape.<ref name="emergency.com"/> Large quantities of thick, acrid smoke were produced by a combination of burning [[soybean oil]] and chicken, and melting roof insulation. One worker later described being overtaken by this smoke while running at full speed to the rear of the facility.<ref name="UnitVII"/> The smoke was later found to be [[hydrocarbon]]-charged and therefore had the potential to disable someone within a few breaths.<ref name="officialreport"/> Several gas lines embedded in the ceiling also caught fire and exploded.<ref name="fedlock">{{cite web |url=http://www.fedlock.com/public_relations/Still_Burning.htm |title=Still Burning |accessdate=2007-02-03 |last=Haygood |first=Wil |date=2002-11-10 |format=HTML |work=[[Washington Post]] }}</ref>

[[Image:Imperial Foods Cooker 2.png|left|thumb|300px|The same cooker viewed from further back to give a better view of the general area. Note the heavy damage to the metal roof girders, testimony to the extreme heat of the fire.]]Those who were able to escape unharmed worked in the front of the building and escaped through the unlocked main entrance, but most workers were trapped by a curtain of smoke.<ref name="UnitVII"/> Workers attempted to escape through the locked doors by kicking them down, but without success. Most of the survivors escaped via a loading bay. The bay was originally blocked by a [[tractor-trailer truck]] but three workers went into the rear of the truck and pounded on the walls until they were heard by rescuers, who moved the vehicle.<ref name="UnitVII"/> Others were able to escape when several workers managed to break open a few of the doors, although for many the open doors came too late.<ref name="fedlock"/> The injured were sent to several different hospitals for treatment for their injuries. One of the deceased worked for an external company and was resupplying the on-site vending machines; no-one even realized he was inside the plant until the company he worked for reported his truck as missing.<ref name="AFSCME">[http://www.afscme.org/publications/2718.cfm Elements of an Emergency Action Plan] - [[AFSCME]] - Obtained February 6, 2007.</ref>

Casualties were high, with twenty-five fatalities; in addition, fifty-four people received injuries such as severe [[burns]], [[blindness]], respiratory disease from [[smoke inhalation]], [[neurology|neurological]] and [[brain damage]], and [[post traumatic stress disorder]].<ref name="emergency.com"/><ref name="Organica"/> Of the fatally injured, eighteen were female and seven were male.<ref name="officialreport"/> Many of the survivors either died early deaths from their injuries or still suffer the effects, and others have become [[addiction|addicted]] to their medication or to [[alcohol]].<ref name="fedlock"/>

===Emergency response===
[[Image:Imperial Floor Plan.png|right|thumb|400px|Floor plan of the factory showing the locations of the origin of the fire and of the killed and injured.]]
The emergency response was slow to start because the telephones inside the building could not be used, so the owner's son drove down to the fire station and informed them there that the factory was on fire but neglected to say that workers were still in the plant.<ref name="fedlock"/> Over 100 medical and emergency service personnel attended the scene,<ref name="emergency.com"/> some of whom ran from a local hospital, and nearby towns provided [[air ambulance|emergency evacuation for the wounded via four helicopters]] from the local hospital to nearby burns units, although they did not attend the scene itself.<ref name="officialreport"/> The emergency response has come under heavy criticism in the aftermath of the blaze. Fire Chief Fuller, who was in charge of the emergency response, refused help several times from nearby Dobbins Heights fire department, located just five minutes drive away. Dobbins Heights fire department was comprised of [[African-American]] [[Volunteer fire department|volunteers]], and there have been allegations that there was racial prejudice on the part of the [[Fire Chief]], especially since the workers, being black, were also of an ethnic minority.<ref name="Organica"/> However, Fuller has defended his decision, saying at the time he refused assistance he did not realize the doors were locked, adding "In a fire like this you need good, seasoned people."<ref name="Organica"/> Witnesses have also said that there were only two oxygen tanks on site, hopelessly inadequate for the large number of casualties.<ref name="Organica"/>

For the purposes of the investigation, Fuller was asked to evaluate the emergency response. He told investigators that he felt there were "more than adequate numbers of personnel and equipment given the layout of the incident site."<ref name="officialreport"/>

==Reactions==
[[Image:Imperila Foods Ariel View.png|left|thumb||300px|A view of the plant taken from an aerial ladder across the street, showing a collapsed section of roof directly above the origin of the fire.]]It was immediately clear that the workers had been trapped by locked fire doors, garnering much controversy. A spokesman for the company admitted that "certain doors" in the plant were locked at "certain times" but refused to elaborate on which doors.<ref name="emergency.com"/> Clark Staten of the [[Emergency Response and Research Institute]] in [[Chicago]] said in response to the blaze "If the initial reports can be believed, this is an intolerable set of circumstances that should result in criminal charges being placed against those responsible for having the fire doors locked... Our past experience with fires and fire deaths shows that we must ensure an adequate number of open exits from any occupied building... It's hard to believe, in today's day and age that any business owner or manager would be so insensitive to fire safety as to allow this sort of incident to happen."<ref name="emergency.com"/>

The Imperial processing facility in Cumming, Georgia was shut down for 24 hours immediately after the fire, when a resulting inspection by the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] found an inoperative sprinkler system, "improper" fire exits and a total lack of any kind of evacuation plan.<ref name="safety record"/> Imperial Foods were told that the plant posed an "imminent danger" to workers because it lacked an automatic fire extinguisher over the cooker similar to the one installed in the Hamlet plant, which failed to prevent the disaster, but did slow the ignition of oil in the vat.<ref name="imminent danger">{{cite news |title=U.S. Tells Poultry Processor Its Plant in Georgia Poses Risks |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20613FE3B540C758CDDA00894D9494D81 |work=The [[New York Times]] |date=1991-09-06 |accessdate=2007-02-02 }}</ref><ref name="officialreport"/>

==Investigation==  
An investigation was immediately launched by state investigators who were joined one month later by federal ones.<ref name="fed. investigators">{{cite news |title=U.S. Agents to Join Carolina Safety Inspectors |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20616FB3E5C0C778EDDA90994D9494D81 |work=The [[New York Times]] |date=1991-10-24 |accessdate=2007-02-02 }} </ref> Investigators found indentations left on at least one door by people attempting to kick it down.<ref name="emergency.com"/> They also discovered concentrations of bodies around [[fire exits]].<ref name="emergency.com"/> There was also a concentration inside a large walk in [[freezer]] where panicked workers had sought shelter. Some sources say they instead quickly froze to death, in temperatures as low as minus 28 degrees [[Celsius]] (-18.4 °F).<ref name="UnitVII"/> However, the official report into the fire states that they were in fact killed by smoke infiltration around the door, which hadn't been shut properly.<ref name="officialreport"/> A total of twelve fatalities occurred in this area, but five people did survive in the freezer, albeit with injuries.<ref name="officialreport"/> The investigation concluded that the high number of deaths and injuries were caused by the locked fire doors; doors that weren't locked were blocked by parked vehicles.<ref name="WisCOSH"/> Timothy Bradly, then North Carolina's Deputy Commissioner of Insurance, said that technically "There was not a single door in the plant that met the criteria of a fire exit."<ref name="WisCOSH"/>

[[Image:Failed Hydraulic Line.png|right|thumb|300px|The remains of the failed hydraulic line. Note the separated end connector lying on the bench]]The fire was caused by failure of a [[hydraulic]] line which powered a [[conveyor belt]] which supplied the cooker vat. The original line had developed a leak, so it was replaced by a maintenance worker. The line it was to be replaced with was a [[mass production|mass produced]] factory line and was longer than was necessary, causing it to snake across the floor in a fashion that was determined to pose a hazard of tripping. The worker therefore requested and received permission to cut the line down to the required size. He did so, and then replaced the factory end connector with the original end connector from the failed line, before recoupling the line to the conveyor. The line was rated to 3,000 [[Pound-force per square inch|psi]], while normal operating pressure never fluctuated higher than 1,500 psi. However, when the line with a customized connector was brought up to normal operating pressure, the line separated from this end connector at somewhere between 800 and 1,500 psi and [[hydraulic fluid]] was forced out at this pressure at an elevation of four to six feet above the concrete floor. This fluid spattered onto the heating plumbs for the cooker and was immediately vaporized. This vapor then went directly into the flame of the gas-fired cooker. The vapor had a relatively low [[flashpoint]] and erupted into a fireball. The ruptured hydraulic line went on to pump a total of fifty to fifty-five [[U.S. customary units#Liquid volume|US gallons]] of hydraulic fluid into the fire before electrical failure shut it down.<ref name="officialreport">{{cite web |url=http://www.interfire.org/res_file/pdf/Tr-057.pdf |title=Chicken Processing Plant Fires: Hamlet, North Carolina (September 3, 1991) and North Little Rock, Arkansas (June 7, 1991) |accessdate=2007-02-06 |format=PDF |work=[[United States Fire Administration]] report }}</ref>

A state-of-the-art automatic [[carbon dioxide]] [[fire extinguisher]] designed to cope with such fires had been installed over the vat after a non-fatal fire in 1983 at the fire department's request. This prevented the oil itself from igniting until the later stages of the fire.<ref name="UnitVII"/><ref name="WisCOSH"/><ref name="officialreport"/>

Some of the blame was also laid upon the authorities. The state Labor Secretary at the time, John Brooks,<!-- Do not wikilink John Brooks; it's not the right person. --> blamed his department's failure to inspect the plant on shortage of money and staff, but also blamed Federal government for not enforcing stricter standards.<ref name="blame on authorities">{{cite news |first=Ronald |last=Smothers |title=North Carolina Examines Inspection Lapses in Fire |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20613FF38580C768CDDA00894D9494D81 |work=The [[New York Times]] |date=1991-09-05 |accessdate=2007-02-02 }} </ref>

===Recommendations===
The final report into the fire made a total of ten recommendations. A quick summary of each point is included below.<ref name="officialreport"/>

*Life safety codes must be enforced. Proper enforcement of existing regulations must occur in future.

*Cooking areas must be separately partitioned from other employee work areas. Cooking operations in food processing plants carry a high risk of fire, and so must be separated from the rest of the building, and from as many workers as possible.

*Building exits in wet type operations should have double emergency lighting, one positioned above the door and one low to the floor. Because the work areas were cooled to comply with food preservation laws, humidity was high, so-called "wet conditions". These conditions cause particularly heavy smoke, obscuring much high-level emergency lighting.

*High pressure equipment maintenance and repairs must be limited to factory trained personnel and specifications. Maintenance personnel working on high-pressure machinery, such as the maintenance employee who conducted the faulty modification to the hydraulic hose in the plant, must be trained by personnel from the factory that supplied the equipment.

*High pressure equipment in probable incident areas should have built-in catastrophic shut down valves. This would reduce the probability of accidents occurring in high-risk areas by shutting down machinery should a fault occur.

*[[Negative pressure|Negative air flow]] systems in these facilities could enhance safety by being modified to also accomplish smoke evacuation. Many similar plants have this equipment, which is designed to quickly purge the air of toxic fumes in the event of accidental release of [[ammonia]]. The report recommends modifying the equipment to also pull heavy smoke away from lower areas.

*State and federal inspectors from various departments should be cross-trained. Had the food inspector reported the problems he saw, the disaster may have been prevented despite the lack of other safety inspections. Such personnel should be trained to recognise major problems and to report them to the relevant authorities.

*Establish a “worry free” line of communications for industry employees. Workers inside the Hamlet plant were afraid to say anything about safety conditions due to fear of being fired. To overcome such problems, states should establish systems of anonymous reporting by workers of problems within their places of work.

*The number of OSHA safety inspectors must be increased. The team of inspectors was hugely overburdened at the time of the accident, and the report says that the number of inspectors requires increasing to solve the problem.

*Emergency exit drills must be incorporated into industry policies. This would allow for quick evacuation of premises like the Hamlet chicken plant.

==Criminal prosecution==
===Prosecution of the owners===
Emmett J. Roe, owner of Imperial Foods Products inc., his son Brad, who was operations manager for the company, and plant manager James N. Hair all surrendered to face prosecution on [[March 13]] [[1992]] and were charged with non-negligent [[manslaughter]].<ref name="NYT2">{{cite news |title=3 Surrender in Plant Fire |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEFDE1731F930A25750C0A964958260 |work=The [[New York Times]] |date=1992-03-13 |accessdate=2007-01-31 }} </ref> There was no trial. Instead on [[September 15]], [[1992]] owner Roe senior pleaded guilty to 25 counts of involuntary manslaughter while his son and another man went free as part of a [[plea bargain]] agreement. It was Roe who had personally ordered the doors to be locked from the outside.<ref name="VA-Pilot">{{cite news |title=Owner Of Hamlet Plant Is Up For Parole |url=http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/VA-news/VA-Pilot/issues/1995/vp950126/01260568.htm |work=The [[Virginia Pilot]] |date=1995-01-26 |accessdate=2007-01-31 }}</ref><ref name="UnitVII"/> He received a prison sentence of approximately 19 years and 11 months, although the exact amount is disputed between various sources.<ref name="prosecution">Henry, Stuart; Mark M.

===Prosecution of Imperial Foods===
Imperial Foods themselves, as a company, although not strictly speaking prosecuted, were fined a total of $808,150 over the incident for offenses such as the locked doors and inadequate [[emergency light]]ing. The amount is comparatively small compared to [[federal law|federal]] penalties that can total millions because the state administers its own safety program.<ref name="UnitVII"/> It is thought that were the Occupational Safety and Health Administration responsible the fines would have totaled between $2.8 million and $10 million.<ref name="WisCOSH"/> Despite this, the fine was still the highest in the history of North Carolina.<ref name="fedlock"/>

===References as a textbook example===

The disaster and subsequent prosecution have been used as textbook cases in books such as ''Essential Criminology'' (1998, Henry, Stuart; Mark M. Lanier) and ''Political Crime in Contemporary America: a Critical Approach'' (1993, Aulette, J.R. & Michaelowski, R.), the latter having an entire chapter devoted to the incident entitled "Fire in Hamlet: a Case Study of [[State-Corporate Crime]]".<ref>Aulette, J.R. & Michaelowski, R.

==Aftermath==
After the fire the factory was permanently closed, with the loss of 215 jobs.<ref name="VA-Pilot"/> Within two years of the accident [[Insurance company|insurance companies]] and the North Carolina business lobby collaboratively introduced legislation to severely limit the compensation available to injured workers and the relatives of the deceased.<ref name="Organica"/> Insurance companies had originally agreed to pay $16.1 million to the injured and the families of the deceased.<ref name="$16.1 million">{{cite news |title=Victims of Poultry-Plant Fire to Get $16.1 Million |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10616FF3B590C7B8CDDA80994DA494D81 |work=The [[New York Times]] |date=1992-11-08 |accessdate=2007-01-31 }} </ref> Some of the workers became activists as a result, to fight what they see as "bureaucratic injustice."

Two separate monuments were erected due to a dispute. Many of the workers and their families wanted [[Jesse Jackson]] to speak in the city's memorial effort. But then mayor Abbie Covington did not want him involved and was backed up by many other local authority figures.<ref name="fedlock"/> The argument is often seen as being discriminatory on the grounds of race or class.<ref name="fedlock"/> The result was that a group of the survivors held their own service, separate to that provided by the authorities, which included Jackson. Both services unveiled near-identical monuments, which are situated just 50 [[yard]]s (46 [[metre]]s) from each other.<ref name="fedlock"/>

Many firefighters also suffered psychological problems after the fire as due to the small size of the community many of the firefighters knew some or all of the victims. Fifty to sixty of them attended counseling sessions as a result.<ref name="officialreport"/>

A memorial service was held in 2000 but by then many survivors had died, mostly due to complications from their injuries.<ref name="fedlock"/> The burned-out shell of the factory remained for many years but was eventually bulldozed by the state in 2001 after they declared it "a public health nuisance" due to the [[psychology|psychological]] impact it had on the victims, many of whom still lived within sight of the structure.<ref name="fedlock"/>
