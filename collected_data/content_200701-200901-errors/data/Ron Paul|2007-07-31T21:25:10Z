<!--Please SEE naming conventions at WP:MOSBIO, please do not add details like "Dr."(this includes adding postnominal degrees after name)-->'''Ronald Ernest Paul''', (born [[August 20]], [[1935]]) is a 10th-term [[United States Congress|Congressman]] from [[Lake Jackson, Texas|Lake Jackson]], [[Texas]], a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], a [[physician]], and a candidate for the Republican nomination in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]]. He has represented [[Texas's 14th congressional district]] in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] since 1997 and represented [[Texas's 22nd congressional district|Texas's 22nd district]] in 1976 and from 1979 to 1985.

==Early life and education==
Paul was born in [[Green Tree, Pennsylvania|Green Tree]], [[Pennsylvania]] (southwest of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]), to Howard Caspar Paul (1904–1997), the son of a [[Germany|German]] [[Lutheran]] [[immigrant]], and Margaret Paul (nee Dumont) (1908–2001), who owned a dairy farm outside Pittsburgh.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.wargs.com/political/paul.html|title= The Ancestors of Ron Paul|accessdate= 2007-05-20|author= Reitwiesner, William Addams|publisher= Wargs.com}}</ref>  He was the third of five sons born during seven years in the [[Great Depression]].<ref name="dailypaul1">{{cite web |url= http://dailypaul.com/node/53|title= The American Dream - Through the Eyes of Mrs. Ron Paul|author= Paul, Carol|date= 2007-03-16|publisher= Daily Paul}}</ref> Paul's father had an eighth-grade education and was co-owner, along with his siblings, Lewis and Arthur, of Green Tree Dairy.  In his early years, Paul began working at his father's dairy at age five.  Later he delivered newspapers and worked in a drugstore and became a [[milkman]] when he was old enough to drive.<ref name="dailypaul1"/>

He graduated from Dormont High School in [[Dormont, Pennsylvania|Dormont]], Pennsylvania, in 1953 with honors.  He excelled in [[Athletics (track and field)|track and field]],<ref name="seattletimes">{{cite web |url= http://seattletimes.nwsource.com:80/html/nationworld/2003810874_paul29.html?syndication=rss|title= Profile: Republican Ron Paul|date= 2007-07-29|publisher=''The Seattle Times''}}</ref> winning the Pennsylvania state championship in the 220-yard dash and coming in second in the 440-yard dash as a junior. He was also on the [[wrestling]] team and president of the student council.<ref name="dailypaul1"/>

Paul paid for his first year at [[Gettysburg College]] with saved newspaper-delivery, lemonade sales and lawn-mowing money. Paul delivered mail and laundry on the side while in Gettysburg; for one year, he managed the college coffee shop.<ref name="dailypaul1"/>  He gave up track after a knee injury, but joined the college's [[swimming]] team instead after taking it up as therapy.  He had been offered a full [[scholarship]] to run for the track team but declined it, worried that he wouldn't regain his previous speed.<ref name="dailypaul1"/>  Paul was inducted into [[Lambda Chi Alpha]] fraternity,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.fraternalcaucus.org/greeks_congress|title= Greeks in Congress|accessdate=2007-07-08 |publisher= Capital Fraternal Caucus}}</ref> and he served as steward and house manager of the fraternity.<ref name="dailypaul1"/>  He received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] [[Academic degree|degree]] in 1957.

Although he had once considered becoming a [[Lutheran]] minister like two of his brothers,<ref name="seattletimes"/> Paul decided to pursue a career in medicine instead and was accepted to [[Duke University School of Medicine]], where he received his [[Doctor of Medicine]] (M.D.) in 1961. He conducted his [[internship]] and a year of [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] training, both in [[internal medicine]], at [[Henry Ford Hospital]] in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] from 1961 to 1962 and residency in [[obstetrics]]/[[gynecology]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] from 1965 to 1968.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=P000583|title= PAUL, Ronald Ernest|accessdate= 2007-05-20|publisher= United States Congress}}</ref>

Paul is well-versed in the economic philosophy of the [[Austrian School]] of economics, and has authored several books ([[Ron Paul#Books authored|see below]]) on the subject. He has pictures of [[Friedrich von Hayek]],  [[Ludwig von Mises]], and [[Murray Rothbard]] hanging on his office wall.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.amconmag.com/2007/2007_06_18/cover.html|title= Lone Star|accessdate=2007-07-08 |author= Brendan Dougherty, Michael|publisher= ''The American Conservative''|date= 2007-06-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://photos-184.ll.facebook.com/photos-ll-sf2p/v77/31/32/153800184/n153800184_30173281_6346.jpg |title="Screenshot.

==Family==
Paul and his wife, Carol Wells, were married on [[February 1]], [[1957]].  Carol asked Ron to their first date at a [[Sadie Hawkins dance]].<ref name="dailypaul1"/> They went to colleges in different states but kept in touch and married in Ron's senior year at [[Gettysburg College]].<ref name="dailypaul1"/>  

They have five children:<ref name="txmonthly2007">{{cite web |url= http://www.texasmonthly.com/preview/2007-08-01/feature2|title= The Elephant in the Room|date= 2007-08|publisher= ''[[Texas Monthly]]''}}</ref>  Ronnie, Lori, Rand, Robert, and Joy. They also have 18 grandchildren and one great-grandchild.<ref name="seattletimes"/>  While they lived in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] for his residency, Carol ran a dance school in their basement.<ref name="dailypaul1"/> Three of the Paul children, Robert, Rand, and Joy also became medical doctors.<ref name="txmonthly2007"/> Rand specializes in [[ophthalmology]] and Robert specializes in [[family practice]]. Like Congressman Paul, his daughter Joy specializes in [[obstetrics]]/[[gynecology]].<ref name="firstfamily">{{cite web |url= http://www.dailypaul.com/node/185 |title= The First Family ???|author= Pyeatt, Matt|date= May 24, 2007|publisher= Daily Paul}}</ref>  Paul supported his children during their undergraduate and medical school years, not allowing them to take part in [[subsidy|subsidized]] federal [[student loan]] programs. He has not signed up for a [[congressional pension]] for the same reason.<ref name="paulfacts"/>

When her husband was campaigning in the 14th District, Carol Paul decided to help his campaign by
compiling family recipes into a cookbook and sending it to constituents.<ref name="txmonthly2007"/> The cookbook is filled with pictures of the large Paul family. Since originally published, five editions have been written. She and other family members keep a "Recipe of the Week" on her husband's Congressional campaign website. 

Paul usually goes home to Lake Jackson on weekends.

==Military service and medical career==
Paul's medical training was interrupted when he was [[Conscription in the United States|drafted]] during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] into the [[United States Air Force]]. He remained in the military during the early years of the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://chbn.com/Clip.aspx?key=1CD9E3A0397BCBEC|title= Congressman Ron Paul Announces Presidential Run while taking LIVE calls on C-SPAN!|accessdate=2007-07-08 |publisher= Capital Hill Broadcasting Network |format= Flash video |quote= (11:26) I was drafted in the '60s.

He served as a [[flight surgeon]] out of [[Kelly Air Force Base]] in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], [[Texas]] from 1963 to 1965. He then served in the [[Air National Guard]] from 1965 to 1968 while completing his [[Residency (medicine)|medical residency]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ronpaulforcongress.com/html/veterans.html |title=Congressman Ron Paul - "Fighting For Our Country" |accessdate= 2007-07-08}}</ref> He achieved rank of [[Captain_%28army/air_force%29|captain]] during his service in the Air Force.<ref>http://www.vote-smart.org/bio.php?can_id=BC031929</ref>

Two years after leaving medical school, Paul worked in the [[Emergency department|emergency room]] of a church hospital in [[San Antonio]] for a wage of [[US Dollar|$3]] an hour. Paul later specialized in [[obstetrics]] and [[gynecology]] where he delivered more than 4,000 babies.  He took over the medical practice of a retiring doctor in [[Lake Jackson, Texas|Lake Jackson]], Texas, where he was busy as the only obstetrician and gynecologist in [[Brazoria County, Texas|Brazoria County]]. Paul said of his time as a doctor, "I delivered forty to fifty babies a month and did a lot of surgery."<ref name="texasmonthly2001">{{cite web |url= http://www.texasmonthly.com/2001-10-01/feature7.php|title= Dr. No|author= Gwynne, S.C.|date= 2001-10-01|publisher= ''[[Texas Monthly]]''}}</ref> Dr. Paul did not accept [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] or [[Medicaid]] as a physician; instead, he worked [[Pro bono publico|for free]] or arranged discounted or custom payment plans for needy patients.<ref name="paulfacts">{{cite web |url= http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/070323/23paulfacts.htm|title= 10 Things You Didn't Know About Ron Paul|author= Burton, Danielle|date= 2007-03-23|publisher= ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]''}}</ref><ref name="paulsneery">{{cite web |url= http://calbears.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3827/is_199806/ai_n8799789|title= Paul vs. Sneery|date= 1998-06-26|publisher= ''Human Events''}}</ref>

==Early congressional career==
A physician for several years in his district before he went into politics, Paul became a [[delegate]] to the Republican Party of Texas [[Political convention|convention]] in 1974. He had decided to enter politics on August 15, 1971, when President [[Richard Nixon]] advocated a complete departure from the [[gold standard]] for the U.S. dollar.  He said, "After that day, all money would be political money rather than money of real value. I was astounded."<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/> 
[[Image:Ron Paul and Reagan.jpg|right|frame|Ron Paul led the Texas Delegation to nominate [[Ronald Reagan]] (left to right: Ron Paul, Jack Fields, Ronald Reagan, and Bill Archer)]] 
Paul was an unsuccessful Republican candidate for Congressman from the 22nd District of Texas in 1974, an election where Democratic candidates won heavily, against the incumbent Democrat [[Robert R. Casey]]. When President [[Gerald R. Ford]] appointed Casey as head of the [[Federal Maritime Commission]], a [[special election]] was held in [[April]] [[1976]] to choose a new congressperson. Paul won that election but lost six months later in the [[general election]] to Democrat [[Robert Gammage|Robert A. Gammage]]. The vote was close: fewer than 300 votes out of 180,000. He then defeated Gammage in a 1978 rematch. Paul won new terms in 1980 and 1982.  Paul was the first Republican to represent the area in the House of Representatives.<ref name="campaigncom">[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF-s1voM_Y The Ron Paul Story] on YouTube accessed on [[June 14]] [[2007]]</ref>  He was one of only four Republican congressmen to endorse [[Ronald Reagan]] for president against [[Gerald Ford]] in 1976,<ref name="2008bio"/> when Dr. Paul led the Texas delegation in support of Reagan at the national Republican convention.<ref name="campaigncom"/>   

Paul delivered babies on Mondays and Saturdays during his entire term as the 22nd District representative.<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/>  During this time, he began to gain his reputation as "Dr. No", with his refusal to vote for laws he felt to be unconstitutional.<ref name="campaigncom"/>

Paul was the first congressman, in the 1970s, to propose [[term limit]] legislation for the House of Representatives,<ref name="wsj1997">[http://www.seedship.com/politics/ronpaul1.html The Libertarian Congressman Is Back] from ''The Wall Street Journal'' accessed on [[June 15]] [[2007]]</ref> where he declined to attend junkets or register for a congressional pension while serving four terms.<ref name="campaign1996">{{cite web |url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2519/is_n6_v17/ai_18535311|title= Paul vs. Laughlin - Ron Paul's campaign against Representative Greg Laughlin|author= Beiler, David|date= 1996-06|publisher= Campaigns and Elections}}</ref>  He proposed legislation to decrease congressional pay at the rate of inflation.<ref name="wsj1997"/>  In 1980, when a majority of Republicans favored President Carter's proposal to reinstate [[Selective Service|draft registration]], he told them that they were inconsistent in their views: they were more eager to register their children than they were to register their guns.<ref name="wsj1997"/> 

Paul served on the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services|House Banking Committee]] during this time, where he spoke against the inflation he saw as being caused by the Federal Reserve.<ref name="2008bio">[http://www.ronpaul2008.com/about/ About Ron Paul] on Ronpaul2008.com accessed on [[June 9]] [[2007]]</ref>  The US Gold Commission created by Congress in 1982 was his idea, and his conclusions from the commission were published by the [[Cato Institute]] as the book ''The Case for Gold''.<ref name="gold">{{cite web |work= J Taylor's Gold & Technology Stocks|date= 2000-05-11 |title= In Defense of our "Unalienable Rights" |url= http://www.usagold.com/gildedopinion/taylorpaulintrvw.html}}</ref> Paul's chief of staff from 1978 to 1982 was [[Lew Rockwell]].<ref name="insight1997">{{Citation |journal= Insight on the News |date= 1997-01-10|author= Berlau, John}}</ref> Paul was a regular participant in the annual Congressional baseball game.<ref name="campaigncom"/>

Paul was an unsuccessful candidate for the [[U.S. Senate]] in the 1984 [[Republican Party (United States)|GOP]] primary against [[Phil Gramm]]. Having chosen to run for the Senate instead of re-election, Paul left Congress in 1985 and returned to full-time medical practice<ref name="2008bio"/> and was subsequently succeeded by [[Tom DeLay]], then a member of the [[Texas House of Representatives]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.lrl.state.tx.us/legis/members/roster.cfm?leg=68|title= Members and leaders of the Texas Legislature|accessdate=2007-07-08 |publisher= Legislative Reference Library of Texas}}</ref> In a farewell address on the House floor, Paul said, "Special interests have replaced the concern that the Founders had for general welfare.  Vote trading is seen as good politics. The errand-boy mentality is ordinary, the defender of liberty is seen as bizarre. It's difficult for one who loves true liberty and utterly detests the power of the state to come to Washington for a period of time and not leave a true cynic."<ref name="insight1997"/>

==1988 presidential campaign==
In the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 presidential election]], Paul defeated American Indian activist [[Russell Means]] to win the [[United States Libertarian Party|Libertarian Party]]'s nomination for the [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidency]]. Appearing on the ballot in 46 states and the [[District of Columbia]],<ref name="1988nytimes">{{cite web |url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0712FB3E5C0C748DDDA90994D0484D81|title=  Now for a Real Underdog: Ron Paul, Libertarian, for President|date= 1988-10-17|publisher= ''[[The New York Times]]''}}</ref> he placed third in the [[popular vote]] (with 431,750 votes - 0.47%), behind Republican [[George H.

Bush had been [[Vice President of the United States|vice-president]].<ref name="campaign1996"/>

During his time as a Libertarian candidate, Paul gained supporters nationwide who agreed with him on many of his positions—- on [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|gun rights]], [[fiscal conservatism]], [[home-schooling]], and abortion, and he won approval from others who thought the federal government was heading in the wrong direction on other issues.  These supporters formed a nationwide support base that encouraged him to return to office and supported his campaigns financially.<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/>  His 2008 campaign chair, Kent Snyder, first worked for Paul on the 1988 campaign, when Snyder says that Senator [[John McCain]] told him, "You're working for the most honest man in Congress."<ref name="txmonthly2007"/>

Paul said that he was doing more during his presidential run than reach office: he was trying to spread his liberty-minded ideas and would often talk to school groups that weren't old enough to vote. "We're just as interested in the future generation as this election.  These kids will vote eventually, and maybe, just maybe, they'll go home and talk to their parents."<ref name="1988nytimes"/>

After the election, Paul had a coin business<ref name="spectator1999">{{citation|title= A principled maverick|date= 1999-11|publisher= ''The American Spectator''}}</ref> and worked at his own [[think tank]] until returning to Congress.<ref name="spectator1999"/>

==Later congressional career==
===Campaigns===
[[Image:Ron paul.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Paul's Congressional portrait]]
In 1996, Paul returned to Congress after a tougher battle than he had faced in the 1970s. He was hopeful that he would be more effective in Congress after the Republicans took over both houses of Congress in the 1994 election.<ref name="paulsneery"/>  His Republican primary opponent, [[Greg Laughlin]], had support from leaders within the Republican Party, including House Speaker [[Newt Gingrich]] and Texas Governor [[George W. Bush]].<ref name="campaign1996"/>  Incumbent Laughlin had switched from the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] to the Republican side the year before, but despite efforts by the national party, challenger Paul won the primary by a large margin.  While Gingrich and other Republican leaders visited the district stumping for Laughlin, Paul ran newspaper ads quoting Gingrich's harsh criticisms of Laughlin's voting record 14 months earlier, before Laughlin switched parties.<ref name="campaign1996"/> Baseball player [[Nolan Ryan]] served as Paul's honorary campaign chairman.<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/> Paul was elected for the coastal 14th Congressional District rather than the 22nd District he had previously represented. The change in district was a result of the borders of redistricting<ref>{{cite web |url= http://ao.nictusa.com/ao/no/900023.html|title= Federal Election Commission Advisory Opinion Number 1990-23|accessdate= 2007-05-26|author= Elliott, Lee Ann|date= 1990-11-05|publisher= }}</ref> as Paul continued to maintain his home in Lake Jackson.

His Democratic opponent in the fall election, [[lawyer]] Charles "Lefty" Morris, lost in a close margin despite running numerous attacks on Paul, including his past votes to repeal federal drug laws in favor of state legislation and portions of old newsletters, assisted by the [[AFL-CIO]].  Paul in turn labeled Morris a pawn of trial lawyers and big labor.  He raised more money than Morris, with the help of his national network of donors: $1.2 million to Morris' $472,153.  Ken Bryan, a Democratic consultant to some of Paul's opponents, has said, "He has one of the largest contributor bases in Congress, outside of the leadership."  Most of Paul's contributions are given in small amounts by individuals.<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/>  That year, he had the third-highest amount of individual contributions of any House member, behind Speaker [[Newt Gingrich]] and [[Bob Dornan]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.reason.com/news/show/118086.html|title= Paul for President?:The maverick libertarian Republican talks on war, immigration, and presidential ambition.|accessdate= 2007-05-28|author= Doherty, Brian|date= 2007-01-22|publisher= Reason Magazine }}</ref>

In 1998 he again won the primary and the election and outraised his opponent by a large margin, $2.1 million to $734,000.  Opposing a Democratic rice farmer and former [[Matagorda County, Texas|Matagorda County]] judge, Loy Sneary, Paul won by 11 percentage points; he ran ads warning voters to be "leery of Sneary."<ref name="saynot">{{cite web |url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/08/AR2006070800966_2.html|title= Congressman Paul's Legislative Strategy?

Sneary's aides said he had voted to raise all county employees' pay by 5% in a "cost of living" increase. Paul countered that he had never voted to raise congressional pay.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.chron.com/cgi-bin/auth/story.mpl/content/chronicle/metropolitan/98/08/15/notebook.2-0.html|title= Foes lock horns over Paul's radio ads|accessdate= 2007-05-26|author= |date= 1998-08-14|work= Campaign Notebook|publisher= Houston Chronicle}}</ref><ref name="paulsneery"/>  

In 2000, Sneary ran against Paul again, with Paul winning 60% to 40%.  He raised $2.4 million to Sneary's $1.1 million in that campaign.<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/>  Paul was re-elected in 2002. Unopposed in 2004, he was re-elected to his ninth term in the Congress, and he was re-elected again in 2006 for his 10th term by a 20-point margin,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2006//pages/results/states/TX/index.html|title= State Races: Texas|accessdate= 2007-03-04|work= Elections 2006|publisher= CNN}}</ref> outraising his opponent $1.2 million to $600,000.<ref name="nosklar">{{cite web |url= http://www.thevictoriaadvocate.com/330/story/72352.html|title= Shane Sklar won't run against Paul in 2008|accessdate= 2007-06-14|work= Elections 2008|publisher= ''The Victoria Advocate''}}</ref>

He has drawn two primary challengers in the next election: Eric Dondero, a former aide fired by Paul,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://reason.com/blog/show/120230.html|title= Blowback, Texas-Style|accessdate= 2007-07-11|publisher= ''Reason'' blog}}</ref>

===Relationship with district===
Paul continued to work as an [[obstetrician]] in [[Brazoria County, Texas]], even while serving in [[United States Congress|Congress]], delivering many constituents' babies.  As of 2001, he was one of few doctors in the House (eight, including dentists) and part of an even smaller group that continued to practice while in office. Journalists have reported that it is not unusual for younger people in his home district to approach him and say that he delivered them.<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/>

Paul is against some legislation that coastal or rural members of Congress usually are not.  Paul's district in Texas borders the [[Gulf of Mexico]] with 675 miles of coastline and also includes suburbs of [[Houston]]; it was redistricted prior to the 2004 election. Paul is opposed to federally funded [[flood insurance]] because it requires those who do not live near [[flood]] zones to subsidize those who choose to live in an area that is prone to flooding and does not allow those in flood zones to choose their own insurer. In an "overwhelmingly rural region," Paul opposes farm subsidies because they go to big corporations rather than small farmers. Despite voting against bills with large support in Congress, such as the farm bill, the congressman's "contrarian nature" and devotion to lowering taxes has appealed to voters in the 14th District.<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/>

While Paul votes against most spending bills, he has diverted funds that have been authorized by other bills into his own district.<ref name="wsj2003">{{cite web |url= http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB104725224693862700.html|title= A Far-Right Texan Inspires Antiwar Left|accessdate= 2007-06-15|author= Murray, Shailagh|date= 2003-03-10|year= 2003|publisher= ''The Wall Street Journal''}}</ref>   Paul spends time in the district to compensate for "violat[ing] almost every rule of political survival you can think of."<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/>  He sometimes spends three to four days a week in his district addressing constituents' concerns, often accompanied by one of his 17 grandchildren.  He attends graduations, civic ceremonies, and [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scout]] honor ceremonies.  In an expansive district, it is not unusual for him to log more than 300 miles per day visiting [[constituents]] or handling their concerns.  He reaches out to 14th District voters on veterans' issues, such as procuring medals for war veterans who lost or never received their medals; he holds medal ceremonies for those whose medals are being presented.  He has helped senior citizens of the district get free or low-cost prescription drugs through a little-known drug company program.<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/>  His staff sends out birthday cards to constituents, as well as [[condolence]] cards on the deaths of family members.<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/>

=== Sponsored legislation ===

Paul sponsors many bills in Congress, such as those that would abolish the [[income tax]] or the [[Federal Reserve]], many of which do not get out of committee.  Nevertheless, he has been named one of the "50 Most Effective Members of Congress" by ''Congressional Quarterly''.<ref name="ronpaulis">{{cite web |url= http://www.ronpaulforcongress.com/html/ronpaulis.html |title= Ron Paul Is… | accessdate= 2007-06-15|publisher= Ron Paul for Congress}}</ref> He has sponsored successful legislation to prevent the [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]] from seizing a church in New York state through [[eminent domain]] and a bill transferring ownership of the [[Lake Texana]] dam project from the federal government to [[Texas]].<ref name="texasmonthly2001"/> Paul has also sponsored legislation to end the [[Bank Secrecy Act]].<ref name="bankact">{{cite web |url= http://www.house.gov/paul/press/press99/pr060999h.htm|title=  Henry Hyde cosponsors Bank Secrecy Sunset Act|accessdate= 2007-06-13|author= Ron Paul congressional office|date= 1999-06-09|year= 1999|publisher= US House of Representatives homepage}}</ref>  Paul said in 2004 that he had refused to vote for more than 700 bills creating a larger government over his previous two terms in office.<ref name="scspeech">{{cite web |url= http://www.lewrockwell.com/yates/yates92.html|title=  An Evening With Dr. Ron Paul|accessdate= 2007-06-13|author= Steven Yates|date= 2004-04-07|year= 2004|publisher= Lew Rockwell}}</ref> In [[March 2001]], Paul introduced the "Constitutional War Powers Resolution of 2001" which would repeal the 1973 [[War Powers Resolution]], and thus prohibit presidents from initiating a war without a formal [[Declaration of war by the United States|declaration of war]] by Congress.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=22022|title= Bill would restore Congress' war powers|accessdate= 2007-06-13|author= Jon Dougherty|date= 2001-03-13|year= 2001|publisher= World Net Daily}}</ref> In 2001, however, Paul voted for the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force]], which authorized the president, pursuant to War Powers Resolution, to respond to the [[September 11]], [[2001]] terrorist attack.<ref name="AUMF"/>

Paul was one of 17 members of a bipartisan coalition of members of Congress who filed a lawsuit against President [[Bill Clinton]] in 1999 over his conduct of the war in [[Kosovo]].  In the filing, they accused Clinton of not reporting to Congress within 48 hours on the status of the action as required by the 1973 War Powers Resolution and not first obtaining a [[Declaration of war by the United States|declaration of war]] from Congress as required in the Constitution.  Congress had voted 427 to 2 against a declaration of war with [[Yugoslavia]] and had voted to deny support for the air campaign in Kosovo.  A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit, ruling that since Congress had voted for funding after the United States was actively engaged in the war with Kosovo, legislators had sent a confusing message about whether they approved of the war. Paul said that the judge's decision was an attempt to circumvent the Constitution and make it legal for the president to conduct a war without approval from Congress.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.house.gov/paul/press/press99/pr060999.htm|title= Judge sides with Clinton|accessdate= 2007-06-12|author= Ron Paul's Congressional office|date= 1999-06-09|year= 1999|publisher= US House of Representatives homepage}}</ref>

Paul introduced legislation in [[October 2002]] for Congress to declare war on [[Iraq]]. He said he would not vote for his own bill, but if his fellow members of Congress wished to go to war in Iraq, they should follow the Constitution and [[Declaration of war by the United States|declare war]]. In a hearing on the resolution, Republican Rep. [[Henry Hyde]] said, "There are things in the Constitution that have been overtaken by events, by time. Declaration of war is one of them. There are things no longer relevant to a modern society. Why declare war if you don’t have to? We are saying to the President, use your judgment. So, to demand that we declare war is to strengthen something to death. You have got a hammerlock on this situation, and it is not called for. Inappropriate, anachronistic, it isn’t done anymore."<ref name="scspeech"/> As one of six Republicans to vote against the Iraq War Resolution, Paul inspired the founding of a group called the National Peace Lobby Project to promote a resolution he and Oregon representative [[Peter DeFazio]] sponsored to repeal the war authorization in February 2003. His column "35 Questions That Won't Be Asked About Iraq"<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.house.gov/paul/congrec/congrec2002/cr091002.htm|title=Questions that won't be asked about Iraq|accessdate= 2007-07-12|author=Congressman Ron Paul|date= 2002-09-10|year= 2002|publisher= US House of Representatives homepage}}</ref> was translated and published in German, French, Russian, Italian, and Swiss publications before the Iraq War began.<ref name="wsj2003"/>

Paul has said his fellow members of Congress have increased domestic spending by 33 percent since Bush came into office. After introduction of a 2005 bill that was touted as "slashing" government waste, he wrote that the bill only decreased spending by less than a fraction of one percent and that "Congress couldn't slash spending if the members' lives depended on it."<ref name="budgetslashing">{{cite web |url= http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul287.html|title=  Too Little Too Late|accessdate= 2007-06-13|author= Ron Paul|date= 2005-11-15|year= 2005|publisher= Lew Rockwell}}</ref>

== Newsletter article controversy ==

An article in a 1992 edition of Paul's ''Ron Paul Survival Report'' (a newsletter that he had published from 1985) made several disparaging comments concerning race and Paul's political opponents.<ref name=HoustonChronicle>{{cite news | title=CAMPAIGN '96 U.S. HOUSE Newsletter excerpts offer ammunition to Paul's opponent | url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070512114222/http://www.chron.com/content/chronicle/aol-metropolitan/96/05/23/paul.html | author=Alan Bernstein | publisher=Houston Chronicle | date=1996-05-22 | accessdate=2007-05-20}}</ref>  According to the ''Atlanta Progressive News,'' the article accused [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] of fathering [[Illegitimacy|illegitimate children]] and using [[cocaine]], and called [[U.S. House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Barbara Jordan]] a "fraud" and a "half-educated victimologist."<ref>Searcy, R. (June 3, 2007) [http://www.atlantaprogressivenews.com/views/0024-views.html "The Ron Paul that Ron Paul Doesn't Want You to Know"] ''Atlanta Progressive News''</ref>  The article said that government should lower the [[Defense of infancy|legal age for prosecuting youths as adults]], saying: "black males age 13 who have been raised on the streets and who have joined criminal gangs are as big, strong, tough, scary and culpable as any adult and should be treated as such." The article also said, "only about 5 percent of blacks have sensible political opinions," and, "95 percent of the black males in [Washington, D.C.] are semi-criminal or entirely criminal."

In a 2001 interview with ''[[Texas Monthly]]'' magazine, Paul acknowledged that the comments were printed in his newsletter under his name, but said that they did not represent his views and that they were written by a [[ghostwriter]]. He further stated that he felt some moral responsibility to stand by the words that had been attributed to him, despite the fact that they did not represent his way of thinking. ''Texas Monthly'' wrote at the time they printed the denial, "What made the statements in the publication even more puzzling was that, in four terms as a U. S. congressman and one presidential race, Paul had never uttered anything remotely like this."<ref name="texasmonthly2001">{{cite web |url= http://www.texasmonthly.com/2001-10-01/feature7.php|title= Dr. No|author= Gwynne, S.C.|date= 2001-10-01|publisher= ''[[Texas Monthly]]''}}</ref>

[[Image:Ronpaul1.jpg|right|thumb|Paul at the 2007 National Right to Life Convention, held at Crown Center Hyatt Regency in Kansas City, MO; June 15, 2007.]]
Ron Paul takes stances that he terms [[Constitutionalism|constitutionalist]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]]. He is an advocate of [[Free trade|free trade]], fewer taxes, [[Limited government|smaller government]], strong national [[sovereignty]] and [[non-interventionism]].<ref name="patriotism">{{cite web | title=Patriotism | url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul388.html | work=House of Representatives |publisher= Lew Rockwell | date=2007-05-22 | accessdate=2007-06-08}}</ref>Paul supports reduced government spending and reduced taxes. As congressman, he has never voted to raise taxes or to approve an [[Deficit|unbalanced budget]] and has also called for the abolition of the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) and the federal income tax.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2rVCI9-tSI|title= Ron Paul Clarifies His Comments About Tax Evaders|accessdate=2007-07-13 |format= Flash video|work= Your World Cavuto|quote= I would certainly work with the Congress the proper way and get the Congress to pass a law to change it and to repeal the 16th Amendment.}}</ref> Paul has been named "The Taxpayer's Best Friend" by the [[National Taxpayers Union]] every year he has been in Congress.<ref name="ntu2008">{{cite web |url= http://www.ntu.org/main/page.php?PageID=97|title= NTU's Fiscal "Snapshot" of the 2008 Presidential Race|accessdate= 2007-06-10|publisher= National Taxpayers Union}}</ref> 

Paul also supports the U.S. converting to a free market health care system and increasing competition and thus opposes [[universal health care]].<ref name="npr-2007-06-05">{{cite web | title=Republican Representative Ron Paul of Texas | url=http://www.nhpr.org/node/13016 | publisher= New Hampshire National Public Radio | date=2007-06-05 | accessdate=2007-06-08}}</ref> Paul is [[pro-life]], yet most recently got a 65% pro-choice score from [[NARAL]]. Paul does not believe that the issue of gay marriage is something that should be decided at the federal level.  As such, Paul opposes "federal efforts to redefine marriage" and has stated that federal intervention on this issue is a "major usurpation of the states’ power."<ref>http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul207.html</ref> Paul said that Americans "understandably fear" the nationwide legalization of gay marriage, and that efforts to prevent states from outlawing same-sex marriage are "profoundly hostile to liberty." He voted to de-fund same-sex adoption in Washington, D.C.

In addition, Paul has asserted that he does not think there should be any federal control over education which be handled at a local and state level. Paul opposes illegal immigration, voted "yes" on the [[Secure Fence Act of 2006]], and opposes [[amnesty]] for illegal immigrants.

Paul supports a non-interventionist foreign policy and opposes foreign aid. He is the only [[2008 Republican presidential candidates|2008 Republican presidential candidate]] to have voted against the [[Iraq Resolution|Iraq War Resolution]] in 2002.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.house.gov/paul/congrec/congrec2002/cr090402.htm|title= Arguments Against a War in Iraq|accessdate=2007-07-07 |date = 2002-09-04|author= Paul, Ron}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.house.gov/paul/congrec/congrec2002/cr100802.htm|title= Statement Opposing the use of Military Force against Iraq|accessdate=2007-07-07 |author= Paul, Ron|date= 2002-09-08}}</ref> Paul voted for the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force]] which resulted in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]] in 2001,<ref name="AUMF">{{cite web |title=Key Vote (How all members voted) Authorization for Use of Military Force| url=http://www.vote-smart.org/issue_keyvote_member.php?cs_id=V3064|publisher= Project Vote Smart| accessdate=2007-07-16}}</ref> but suggested alternatives including giving the president authority to grant [[Letters of Marque and Reprisal]] to target specific terrorists.

{{main|Ron Paul presidential campaign, 2008}}

On [[February 19]], [[2007]], Paul formed an [[exploratory committee]] to gauge support for a run in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 United States presidential election]].<ref name="CSPAN"/> Saying that he had been "pleasantly surprised" by the the findings of the committee, Paul formally declared his candidacy for the [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|Republican nomination]] on [[March 12]], [[2007]] as a guest on [[C-SPAN]]'s ''[[Washington Journal]]''.<ref name="CSPAN">{{cite web |url= http://chbn.com/Clip.aspx?key=1CD9E3A0397BCBEC|title= Congressman Ron Paul Announces Presidential Run while taking LIVE calls on C-SPAN!|accessdate=2007-07-08 |publisher= Capital Hill Broadcasting Network |format= Flash video}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA031207.paul2008.EN.74141d9.html | title = Paul formally launches presidential bid | first = Gary | last = Martin | work = San Antonio Express-News | date = 2007-03-12 | accessdate = 2007-03-13}}</ref>

As of [[July 6]], Ron Paul had the third most cash on hand of the Republican candidates with $2.4 million, putting him ahead of [[John McCain]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2007/07/ron-paul-tops-m.html|title= Ron Paul Tops McCain in Cash on Hand|accessdate=2007-07-07 |publisher= ABC News |date=2007-07-06}}</ref> 100% of Paul's funds comes from individuals,<ref>http://www.opensecrets.org/pres08/summary.asp?id=N00005906&cycle=2008</ref> with almost half (47%) raised from small contributions ($200 or less).<ref>http://www.cfinst.org/pr/prRelease.aspx?ReleaseID=155</ref>

Paul has participated in all three nationally-televised [[Republican Presidential Debates, 2008|Republican presidential candidate debates]] held thus far. His most prominent moment came during the [[May 15]] GOP Presidential debate when the following exchange occurred with fellow Republican hopeful [[Rudy Giuliani]]:

<blockquote>PAUL: They attack us because we've been over there. We've been bombing Iraq for 10 years. We've been in the Middle East [for years]. I think [Ronald] Reagan was right. We don't understand the irrationality of Middle Eastern politics. Right now, we're building an embassy in Iraq that is bigger than the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. We're building 14 permanent bases. What would we say here if [[People's Republic of China|China]] was doing this in our country or in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]? We would be objecting.</blockquote>

<blockquote>GIULIANI: That's really an extraordinary statement. That's an extraordinary statement, as someone who lived through the attack of September 11, that we invited the attack because we were attacking Iraq. I don't think I've heard that before, and I've heard some pretty absurd explanations for September 11th. And I would ask the congressman to withdraw that comment and tell us that he didn't really mean that.</blockquote>

<blockquote>PAUL: I believe very sincerely that the [[CIA]] is correct when they teach and talk about [[blowback (intelligence)|blowback]]. When we [[1953 Iranian coup d'état|went into Iran in 1953 and installed the Shah]], yes there was blowback.  The reaction to that was the taking of our hostages, and that persists.  And if we ignore that, we ignore that at our own risk.  If we think we can do what we want around the world and not incite hatred, then we have a problem.  They don't come here to attack us because we're rich and we're free, they come and attack us because we're over there.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7d_e9lrcZ8|title= May 15 GOP Presidential debate|accessdate=2007-07-16 |format= Flash video|publisher= Fox News}}</ref></blockquote>

Prior to the campaign, in a [[CNN]] [[Opinion_poll#Coverage bias|telephone poll]] conducted in [[February 2007]], he was the candidate with the least name recognition besides [[John H.
