'''''The Rocky Horror Picture Show''''' is a [[1975 in film|1975]] [[musical film|musical]] [[comedy film]] that parodies [[science fiction]] and [[horror films]]. With a screenplay written by [[Richard O'Brien]] and [[Jim Sharman]], the film features [[Tim Curry]], [[Susan Sarandon]] and [[Barry Bostwick]]. The film is based on the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[musical theatre|musical stage production]] ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]''.  

The film is considered a [[cult classic]] and a [[midnight movie]], although it is widely known by mainstream audiences and has a large international following. ''RHPS'' was the first movie from a major film studio — [[20th Century Fox]] — in the midnight-movie market.<ref name="Samuels_MidMov_11">{{cite book |title = Midnight Movies | last=Samuels | first=Stuart | publisher = Collier Books |year = 1983 | pages = 11 | isbn=0-02-081450-X}}</ref> The movie is one of the most well known and financially successful midnight movies.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.filmreference.com/encyclopedia/Criticism-Ideology/Cult-Films-MIDNIGHT-MOVIES.html | title  = Cult Films MIDNIGHT MOVIES | accessdate = 2007-08-03 | publisher=www.filmreference.com}}</ref> It is the longest running theatrical release in film history.<ref>{{Cite press release | url = http://www.rockyhorror.com/news/pr_25thannivdvd.php | title = Fox Celebrates 25 Years of Absolute Pleasure, Pop Culture Phenomenon and Midnight Classic | publisher = RHPS Official Fan Site | date = 2000-08-24 | accessdate=2007-08-03}}</ref> More than 30 years later it is still in limited release in cinemas around the world. In 2005, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

==Plot==
[[Image:Rocky Horror 1.JPG|thumb|left|185px|Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick) begins to propose to Janet Weiss (Susan Sarandon).]]
The story, narrated by a [[criminologist]] ([[Charles Gray (actor)|Charles Gray]]), is that of a newly engaged young couple, Brad Majors ([[Barry Bostwick]]) and Janet Weiss ([[Susan Sarandon]]), who find themselves lost and with a flat tire on a cold and rainy night. Seeking a phone with which to call for help, the two knock on the door at a nearby castle, which they find is inhabited by strange and outlandish people who are holding an Annual Transylvanian Convention. They watch, still wet from the rain, as the Transylvanians dance the [[Time Warp]], the film's signature song.

They are soon swept into the world of Dr. Frank-N-Furter ([[Tim Curry]]), a bizarre and self-proclaimed "sweet transvestite from Transsexual, Transylvania" and his servants, brother and sister Riff Raff ([[Richard O'Brien]]) and Magenta ([[Patricia Quinn]]), as well as a 1970-style [[groupie]] Columbia ([[Nell Campbell]]) and an ensemble of convention attendees. It is Frank's intention to unveil the "secret to life itself". He takes the whole group up to his lab "to see what's on the slab." In a scene inspired by Frankenstein movies, "Rocky Horror" ([[Peter Hinwood]]) is brought to life. After the disoriented Rocky runs, and is chased down and tackled by Frank, the party is interrupted by the arrival of Eddie ([[Meat Loaf]]), an ex-delivery boy, who rides out of a deep freeze on a motorcycle. Eddie enchants everyone, and in a jealous response, Frank corners and slaughters Eddie (to everyone's horror) with an ice axe.

Brad and Janet are shown to separate bedrooms, and after they each go to bed, they are visited by someone who they each think is their fiancé(e).  They both find it to be Frank in disguise, but are seduced nonetheless.  Janet, upset and emotional, wanders off to look for Brad. She discovers Rocky, cowering in his birth tank, hiding from Raff who has been tormenting him, much as Igor tormented Frankenstein's monster. Janet, already having watched Brad's infidelity on closed circuit TV, decides to climb into the tank with the frightened and trembling Rocky. After discovering his "Creature" is missing, Frank, Brad, and Riff Raff return to the lab where Frank learns that an intruder has entered the building. Dr. Everett Scott ([[Jonathan Adams]]), Brad and Janet's old high school science teacher, has come looking for his nephew, Eddie. Frank is very suspicious of Dr. Scott, who, besides being a science teacher, Frank suspects (correctly) of being a scientist working for the government and investigating Frank.

It is at this point that Rocky and Janet are discovered hiding, obviously having had sex. <!-- please merge this with next paragraph for chronological order --> In a scene added specifically for the film version, Rocky and the guests are served a roast meat dinner, which they soon realize from Frank's hints may have been prepared from Eddie's remains. After Frank tears the tablecloth from the transparent table, they see what they have been served, and in most cases consumed, Janet runs screaming from the room, and is chased through the halls of the castle by Frank.  Janet, Brad, Dr. Scott, Rocky, and Columbia all meet in Frank's lab, where Frank captures them by turning them into plaster statues.  They are transported to a theater stage, and made to/hypnotized to participate one-at-a-time in a [[cabaret]]-style floor show. The performance is interrupted by the appearance of Riff Raff and Magenta, who rather than being servants, introduce themselves as a posse sent to capture Frank, and then to return to the planet Transexual.  After explaining to Frank that he is not going back with them, they use a laser to kill him, and in the process also kill Columbia and Rocky. They release the earthlings—Brad, Janet, and Dr. Scott— warning them to get off the property which they do as the entire castle takes off into space to return to the planet of Transsexual, in the galaxy of Transylvania.

==Production==
Based on the London stage production ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]'', by [[Richard O'Brien]], ''The Rocky Horror Picture Show'' is slightly different from its original theatrical conception. In the production of the film, many of the original aspects from the [[Kings Road]] stage production changed, as did characters and dialogue, although many cast- and crew-members from its original production returned to work on the film. Director Jim Sharman, production designer Brian Thomson, and costume designer Sue Blane collaborated on the original London production with many of the cast that 
made it into the film version.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://poll.imdb.com/title/tt0073629/usercomments?start=10 | author = Whittaker, Jim | title = A Musical Dream Come True | work = Rocky Horror Picture Show: IMDb user comments | publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] | accessdate=2007-06-13 |date = 2005-01-01 }} </ref> Tim Curry reprised his role from the London and Los Angeles stage productions. After the film, Curry also did a short run on Broadway as Dr. Frank-N-Furter. Creator Richard O'Brien (Riff Raff) also returned for the film from the British stage team, as did Little Nell (Columbia) and Patricia Quinn (Magenta). Jonathan Adams, the narrator from the original cast, also returned for the film, instead playing Dr. Scott. <ref name="Samuels_MidMov">{{cite book |title = Midnight Movies | last=Samuels | first=Stuart | publisher = Collier Books |year = 1983 | pages = 127, 132 | isbn=0-02-081450-X}}</ref>  The film was shot at [[Bray Studios]] and [[Oakley Court]], a country house in [[Berkshire, England]], UK from [[October 21]], [[1974]] to [[December 19]], [[1974]].   Filming of Rocky's birth occurred on [[October 30]], [[1974]], the 81st anniversary of the birth of [[Charles Atlas]].<ref>{{cite book |title = The Rocky Horror Picture Show Book | last=Henkin | first=Bill | publisher = Dutton Adult |year = 1979 | pages = 16 | isbn=978-0801564369}}</ref>

Several ideas from the original conception of the film were dropped before production. During the opening theme, the film was supposed to include clips from all the movies mentioned in the song "Science Fiction Double Feature".<ref name="script">{{web cite | url =http://www.godamongdirectors.com/scripts/rhps.shtml| author = O'Brien, Richard, Sharman, Jim | title = The Rocky Horror Picture Show (original shooting script)| work = www.godamongdirectors.com| accessdate=2007-07-01 |date = 2005-01-01 }} </ref> Producers discovered quickly that obtaining the rights to all the various film clips would be very costly, and cut the idea. Another idea was to parallel ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939) by having the first 20 minutes of the film in black-and-white and [[Academy ratio]] until the doors burst open showing the Transylvanians in [[widescreen]] and then to full color at Frank's entrance.<ref name="script"/> This effect would have been prohibitively expensive, so the idea was discarded. The film was, however, shot in the narrower [[Aspect ratio (image)|1.66:1 aspect ratio]].

===Locations, sets, and props===
[[Image:OakleyCourt.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Oakley Court refurbished and now a luxury hotel.]]
The film's plot, setting, and style echoes that of the [[Hammer Horror]] films, which had their own instantly recognisable style (just as [[Universal Studios]]' Horror films did), re-using sets and props through many of their films. Production designer Brian Thomson and director Jim Sharman chose locations, sets, and even props for the Rocky Horror Picture Show that were, in many cases, used in Hammer productions. The classic "Creation" scene in Rocky Horror is so reminiscent of "Frankenstein" movies because it uses the tank and dummy from a Hammer production of "[[The Revenge of Frankenstein]]" starring [[Peter Cushing]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073629/trivia | title = Trivia for The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975) | publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] | accessdate=2007-07-01}}</ref>

The castle is known as the Hammer House for the number of films that it appeared in. A great deal of location shooting took place here. At the time, the manor was in very dilapidated condition. Filming took place during autumn, which made conditions harsh. Today, the castle, [[Oakley Court]], has been completely refurbished and is now a luxury hotel.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.oakleycourt.co.uk/ | title = Welcome to Oakley Court |accessdate=2007-06-13}}</ref> It recently hosted a Rocky Horror picnic on its grounds.

===Costumes===
Perhaps the most unusual parts of this film are the costumes worn by the cast. Costume designer [[Sue Blane]] based all her designs on what little she knew of 1950's America as well as a previous stage production she designed called "The Maids". It is from this production that Tim Curry's Victorian corset is borrowed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.crazedimaginations.com/interviews.html|title="Don't Blane Sue-she just made the costumes!"|accessdate=2007-07-01}}</ref> Blane compared the relatively small ($400) costume budget of the stage show to the $1600 costume budget in 1974 for the film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rockymusic.org/showdoc/SueBlane-1979Interview.php|last=Morrisroe|first=Patricia|title=The costume designer for Rocky Horror shows her stuff.|accessdate=2007-07-01}}</ref> 

Nearly all the costume designs from the original stage production were transferred directly to the film, with a few exceptions. Some new designs appeared as well as a few that were discarded. In the London stage production, Tim Curry began the role of Frank-N-Furter as a blond, although it was short lived, the original design sketches by Blane do reflect that. Magenta gained a new maid costume to give the character more purpose and Columbia gained a sequined tuxedo and tails.

The introduction of new characters such as the Transylvanians presented Sue Blane with a challenge to costume a number of extras who reappear throughout the film. The outcome of their costuming did not satisfy Blane who stated that she wished she had more time for those particular costumes.

In the stage productions, actors generally did their own make-up, but for this film producers chose famed artist Pierre La Roche to redesign the make-up for each character. La Roche is also famous for designing make-up for [[David Bowie]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0478929/| title=Pierre La Roche | publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] | accessdate=2007-06-13}}</ref> Production stills were taken by an artist famous for his 1970's rock photographs, [[Mick Rock]]. The photographer has published many calendars and photo books from his Rocky Horror work.

===Casting===
[[Image:RHPS cast.JPG|right|thumb|250px|The majority of the cast from ''The Rocky Horror Picture Show'' posing for the wedding photo at Ralph and Betty's wedding in the movie's opening scene.]]
*'''[[Tim Curry]]''' as '''Dr. Frank-N-Furter''', a [[Scientist]]. Auditioning for the part for the original stage production Tim Curry sang the song "[[Tutti Frutti (song)|Tutti Frutti]]". He originated the role and recreated it in all productions except the [[Australia]]n production up to filming. Frank is a flamboyant, well-meaning, often devious and sometimes evil [[Transvestism|transvestite]], [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] scientist.
*'''[[Susan Sarandon]]''' as '''Janet Weiss''', a [[Heroine]]. Sarandon was not the first choice for the Production but Twentieth Century Fox insisted on American casting for the part of both Brad and Janet. Janet Weiss is the well-meaning, sweet and somewhat naive woman who was recently engaged to Brad, who gets tempted into bad ways.
*'''[[Barry Bostwick]]''' as '''Brad Majors''', a [[Hero]]. Bostwick had previously had training in singing, juggling, trapeze, clown techniques, fencing, mime and ballet before his role in the film. Brad Majors is the clean-cut fiancé of Janet Weiss, to whom he recently proposed at a friend's wedding. 
*'''[[Richard O'Brien]]''' as '''Riff Raff''', a [[Handyman]]. The author and song writer, Richard O'Brien had originally seen himself as Eddie. It was director Jim Sharman who cast him as Riff Raff. 
*'''[[Patricia Quinn]]''' as '''Magenta''', a [[Domestic worker|Domestic]]. Quinn reprises her role from the original stage production, however she was not in any of the other productions. She almost did not return for the filming, as the part was drastically reduced from the stage play. Magenta is the sister of Riff Raff, and works as Frank's domestic worker. Patricia Quinn's lips are also used for the iconic opening number and movie poster. 
[[Image:Rocky Horror 2.JPG|thumb|left|185px|Dr. Frank-N-Furter (Tim Curry) in his most iconic role, as self proclaimed "Sweet Transvestite from Transexual, Transylvania."]]
*'''[[Nell Campbell]]''' as '''Columbia''', a [[Groupie]]. Laura "Little Nell" Campbell recreates her character from the original stage production. Columbia is the groupie and friend of Frank, but also Eddie's alleged lover. 
*'''[[Jonathan Adams]]''' as '''Dr. Everett Von Scott''', a Rival Scientist. He was Brad and Janet's science teacher. He has come to the castle in search of his nephew Eddie, who has been murdered by Frank. Adams originally played the role of the Narrator in the London production.
*'''[[Peter Hinwood]]''' as '''Rocky Horror''', a Creation. Muscle bound creation of Frank's, with blond hair and a tan. Peter Hinwood has his own solo in "Sword of Damocles", but does not speak throughout the show. This was changed from the stage show.  Rocky's songs are performed by Trevor White.
*'''[[Charles Gray (actor)|Charles Gray]]''' as '''The Criminologist''', an [[Expert]]. Narrator of the film. Gray accepted the role by saying, "Why not?" The character becomes a criminologist in the film, another change from the stage production.
*'''[[Meat Loaf]]''' as '''Eddie''', an ex-delivery boy. Columbia's boyfriend. Dr. Frank-N-Furter murders Eddie in the film version. In the stage version, Eddie merely pops out of a Coke machine and then jumps back in at the end of the scene.

==Release==
The film has found a major longevity in many venues throughout the years in the United States, as well as internationally. The movie is considered to be the longest running release in film history.<ref>{{Cite press release | url = http://www.rockyhorror.com/news/pr_25thannivdvd.php | title = Fox Celebrates 25 Years of Absolute Pleasure, Pop Culture Phenomenon and Midnight Classic | publisher = RHPS Official Fan Site | date = 2000-08-24 | accessdate=2007-06-13}}</ref> It has never been pulled by Twentieth Century Fox from its original 1975 release, and continues to play in cinemas more than thirty years later. Some cinemas showing the movie have run it for decades at a time. 

The film was released on VHS during the [[home video]] boom of the 1980s, except for in the U.S., which had to wait for the 15th anniversary in 1990. The limited VHS edition release had a suggested retail price of $100. In 1993, a [[LaserDisc]] edition was released, and in 1995 a Special Edition LaserDisc was released. On the 25th anniversary in 2000, the DVD with all the special features from the LaserDisc, as well as new features and [[DVD-Rom]] games was released. Before the mainstream use of home video a Super 8 version of selected scenes of the film was available.<ref>Piro, Sal and Hess, Michael (1991) ''The Official Rocky Horror Picture Show Audience Par-tic-i-pation Guide.''  Livonia, MI: Stabur Press. 77.</ref> 

There are two versions of ''The Rocky Horror Picture Show'', the US and British releases. The British version contains the original ending which includes the full version of the musical number "Super Heroes". The US version edits out the number, which was thought to be too depressing by the studio. Both versions are on the 25th Anniversary DVD.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073629/alternateversions| title=Alternate versions for The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975)

==Reception==
{{main|The Rocky Horror Picture Show cult following}} 
The film opened in the U.S. at the UA Theatre in Westwood, California on [[September 26]], [[1975]]. It did well at that location but not elsewhere.<ref>{{cite book |title = The Rocky Horror Picture Show Book | author= Henkin, Bill | publisher = Dutton Adult |year = 1979 | pages = 25 | ISBN=978-0801564369}}</ref> The [[The Rocky Horror Picture Show cult following|cult following]] did not begin until the movie began its midnight run at the Waverly Theatre in New York on [[April 1]], [[1976]].<ref>{{cite book |title = The Rocky Horror Picture Show Book | author= Henkin, Bill | publisher = Dutton Adult |year = 1979 | pages = 26 | ISBN=978-0801564369}}</ref> The film is still shown with audience members acting out the entire movie in front of the screen.  The [http://www.clintonsttheater.com/ Clinton Street Theater] in [[Portland, Oregon]] has also shown the movie weekly since its debut there in [[April]], [[1978]].

Overall, critics were negative with their reviews of the movie. The overly sexual nature of this British rock comedy was not well received by the mainstream media of 1975, although there were positive reviews. The music was praised, as was Tim Curry's performance. However, before the success of the midnight screenings, the film was withdrawn from its eight opening cities due to very small audiences, and its planned New York opening (on Halloween night) was cancelled.<ref name="Samuels_MidMov_133">{{cite book |title = Midnight Movies | last=Samuels | first=Stuart | publisher = Collier Books |year = 1983 | pages = 133 | ISBN=0-02-081450-X}}</ref>  Fox re-released it around college campuses on a double-bill with another rock music film parody, [[Brian De Palma]]'s ''[[Phantom of the Paradise]]'', but again it drew small audiences.<ref name="Samuels_MidMov_133" />  With ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'' (1972) and ''[[Reefer Madness]]'' (1936) making money in midnight showings nationwide, ''RHPS'' was eventually screened at midnight, starting in New York City on April Fools' Day of 1976.<ref name="Samuels_MidMov_134">{{cite book |title = Midnight Movies | last=Samuels | first=Stuart | publisher = Collier Books |year = 1983 | pages = 134 | ISBN=0-02-081450-X}}</ref>  By that Halloween, people were attending in costume and talking back to the screen.  By mid-1978, ''RHPS'' was playing in over fifty locations on Fridays and Saturdays at midnight, newsletters were published by local performance groups, and fans gathered for ''Rocky Horror'' conventions.<ref name="Samuels_MidMov_136">{{cite book |title = Midnight Movies | last=Samuels | first=Stuart | publisher = Collier Books |year = 1983 | pages = 136 | ISBN=0-02-081450-X}}</ref>  By the end of 1979, there were twice-weekly showings at over 230 theaters.<ref name="Samuels_MidMov_137">{{cite book |title = Midnight Movies | last=Samuels | first=Stuart | publisher = Collier Books |year = 1983 | pages = 137 | ISBN=0-02-081450-X}}</ref> 

''The Rocky Horror Picture Show'' has taken in $139,876,417 (USA) (sub-total) in box office receipts since its release.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073629/business| title=Box office / business for

After the release, the original advertising campaign for screen and television was pulled by Twentieth Century Fox executives in the very early stage. The studio objected to the use of the red lipsticked lips uttering the words Twentieth Century Fox.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.geocities.com/TelevisionCity/Studio/8849/Moviemusicals/Leather/Timewarp.htm| last=Sutton | first=Lisa Kurtz | title=Rocky Horror History | access date=2007-07-01 | publisher=Absent Friends, The Australian Rocky Horror Fan Club}}</ref> The [[United States|American]] [[television network]] [[Fox Broadcasting]] aired the film's much-publicized US television premiere on [[October 25]], [[1993]].
