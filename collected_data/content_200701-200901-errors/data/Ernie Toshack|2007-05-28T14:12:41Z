'''Ernest Raymond Herbert Toshack''' (born [[December 8]], [[1914]], [[Lyndhurst, New South Wales]], died [[May 11]], [[2003]], [[Bobbin Head, New South Wales]]) was an [[Australia]]n [[cricket]]er who played in 12 [[Test cricket|Tests]] from 1946 to 1948.

== Early years ==

Born in the New South Wales bush town of [[Cobar]] on December 8, 1914, he was the son of a stationmaster, but was orphaned as an infant. He was raised by relatives in Lyndhurst, in the northwest of the state. He played his early cricket and [[rugby league]] for [[Cowra]].<ref name="az">{{cite book| last = Cashman |first=Richard | year = 1997 | title = The A-Z of Australian cricketers|pages =299-300}}</ref> In his youth he was also a [[boxer]], and earned the nickname ‘’Johnson’’ for his resemblance to American black heavyweight champion [[Jack Johnson]] due his dark skin. In the mid 1930s, he made brief appearances for the State Colts and 2nd XI.<ref name="wisden">{{cite web| title= Players and Officials - Ernie Toshack | url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/7960.html | publisher=[[Wisden]]| accessdate=2007-05-23}} </ref> His cricket aspirations, already hindered due to economic difficulties caused by the [[Great Depression]] were interrupted after he was wheelchair-bound for months after a ruptured appendix in 1938.<ref name="az"/> Not allowed to enlist in the [[Australian Defence Force]] during the [[Second World War]] due to these concerns, he worked at [[Lithgow]]’s Small Arms factory, in the [[Blue Mountains]] west of Sydney. Only at the end of the war, aged 30 did he venture to Sydney. At the time, he was a fastish left-arm bowler and approached [[Petersham, New South Wales|Petersham]], the club for which he was residentially zoned. After they rejected him he joined Marrickville in [[Sydney Grade Cricket]], starting in third grade in 1944-45.<ref name="wisden"/> Within two matches, he rose to first grade.<ref name="az"/>

== First class and Test debut ==

Upon the resumption of first class cricket in 1945-46, he made his debut for [[New South Wales Blues|New South Wales]] as an opening bowler aged almost 31, and was quickly among the wickets. At the end of the season in  March 1946, after only seven first class matches, he found himself opening the bowling for Australia with [[Ray Lindwall]] in a match at [[Wellington]] which was retrospectively recognised as a Test two years later.<ref name="az"/> [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] were routed in two days on a damp pitch, and Toshack recorded figures of 4/12 and 2/6. The performance ensured that Toshack would become an integral part of Australia’s attack for the next three years.<ref name="obit"/><ref name="wisden"/>

He was selected to make his Ashes debut against the [[England cricket team]] in the First Test of the 1946-47 home series in [[Brisbane]]. On a sticky wicket, he initially struggled, bowling his characteristic leg stump line. On the fifth morning, captain [[Don Bradman]] advised him to pitch straighter and at a slower pace. Starting wicketless on the final morning, he took 3/17 and 6/82, to end with match figures of 9/99 as England were bowled out twice in one day, having followed on. The remaining four Tests were less successful: only in one innings did he take more than one wicket. That was in the Adelaide Test, when he took 5/66 from a long spell of 66 eight ball overs in extreme heat.<ref name="obit">{{cite web| title= Obituary, 2004 - Ernie Toshack | url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/155391.html |year=2004 | publisher=[[Wisden]]| accessdate=2007-05-23}}</ref><ref name="wisden"/> 

The following 1947-48 season against [[Indian cricket team|India]] at [[Brisbane]], he collected his only ten wicket match haul in Tests. He took 5/2 in 19 balls to end the tourists’ first innings, before taking 6/29 in the second innings.<ref name="obit"/>

== Invincibles tour ==

By then, knee injuries had begun to hamper him, and he only made the trip to England for the 1948 tour on a 3-2 majority vote by a medical team, despite being one of the first selected by the board. The tour was to guarantee him immortality as a member of Bradman's '[[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|Invincibles]]'. He grew tired of signing autographs during the voyage, and entrusted a friend with the task. As a result,  there are still sheets with his name mis-spelt as ''Toshak''. Between the new-ball attacks of Lindwall, [[Keith Miller]] and [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]] every 55 overs, Toshack played the role of stifling England's scoring. In one match aginst [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]], his 17 overs yielded only three scoring shots. He finished the match bowling 32 overs while conceding 29 runs.<ref name="obit"/><ref name="wisden"/>

At [[Bramall Lane]], [[Sheffield]], he recorded the best innings analysis of his first class career, taking 7/81 from 40 consecutive overs, bemusing the [[Yorkshire]] spectators with the his accent and distinctive “Ow Wizz Ee” appealing. Bradman considered his 6/51 against the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] at [[Lord's Cricket Ground|Lord's]] as the best performance of all. His Test performance was highlighted by his 5/40 in the Second Test at Lord’s when Miller was unable to bowl after being injured. His knee injury flared again in the Fourth Test and he was taken to [[London]] for cartilage surgery, ending his tour and his Test career. An inept batsman with an average of 5.78 in first class fixtures, Toshack fluked a Test average of 51 in the 1948 tour after being out only once, behind only [[Arthur Morris]], [[Sid Barnes]], Bradman and [[Neil Harvey]]. The unbeaten 20 he managed in the Lord's Test was his best first-class score, made in a uninhibited tenth-wicket stand with Johnston.<ref name="obit"/><ref name="wisden"/>

At the start of the 1949-50 season, after he took nine wickets in a Shield match in Brisbane, a back injury made forced him to retire from first class cricket. Toshack subsequently joined a firm of builders and spent 25 years as a foreman and supervisor on construction sites around Sydney.<ref name="az"/> He was survived by a wife and daughter.<ref name="obit"/><ref name="wisden"/>

== Style ==

Bowling primarily from over the wicket, his accuracy, changes of pace, and movement in both directions, coupled with a leg stump line to a packed leg-side field, made scoring off him difficult.<ref name="az"/> He achieved his success in a manner not dissimilar to [[Derek Underwood]] a generation later. His accuracy and stamina allowed Lindwall and Miller, one of Australia’s finest fast bowling pairs of all time, to draw breath between short and incisive bursts of pace and swing. Standing 6 ft 2 in, he was particularly effective on rain-affected wickets, reducing his speed to medium pace and using a repertoire of offcutters, inswingers, outswingers and leg breaks. Bowling a leg-stump line from over the wicket with a leg side cordon of two short legs and a silly mid-on, he was described by Bradman as "unique in every way".<ref name="obit"/><ref name="wisden"/>

Nicknamed the “Black Prince”, Toshack's looks and sense of humour made him a crowd favourite, as did his theatrical appealing. His sense of fun was often on show. He would often wear a bowler hat, grab a furled umbrella, and place a cigar in his mouth, imitating an Englishman.<ref name="obit"/><ref name="wisden"/>
