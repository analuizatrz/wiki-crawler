'''Thomas Jefferson''' ([[April 13]], [[1743]] [[Old Style and New Style dates|N.S.]] &ndash; [[July 4]], [[1826]]) was the third [[President of the United States]] (1801&ndash;1809), the principal author of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] (1776), and one of the most influential [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] for his promotion of the ideals of [[Republicanism in the United States]]. Major events during his presidency include the [[Louisiana Purchase]] (1803), the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] (1804–1806) and the failed [[Embargo Act of 1807]].

As a political philosopher, Jefferson idealized the independent yeoman farmer as exemplar of the republican virtue, distrusted cities and financiers, and favored states' rights and a strictly limited federal government. He supported the [[separation of church and state]] and was the author of the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]] (1779, 1786). He was the eponym of [[Jeffersonian democracy]] and the founder and leader of the Jeffersonian Republican party (eventually to become known as the [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Democratic-Republican Party]]), which dominated [[Politics of the United States|American politics]] for a quarter-century. Jefferson served as the wartime [[Governor of Virginia]] (1779&ndash;1781), first [[United States Secretary of State]] (1789&ndash;1793) and second [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] (1797&ndash;1801).

A [[polymath]], Jefferson achieved distinction as an [[horticulturist]], [[architect]], [[archaeologist]], [[paleontologist]], [[author]], [[inventor]], and the [[University of Virginia#History|founder of the University of Virginia]], among other roles. President John F. Kennedy welcomed forty-nine Nobel Prize winners to the White House in 1962, saying, "I think this is the most extraordinary collection of talent and of human knowledge that has ever been gathered together at the White House -- with the possible exception of when Thomas Jefferson dined alone."<ref>April 29, 1962 dinner honoring 49 Nobel Laureates (''Simpson’s Contemporary Quotations'', 1988, from ''Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States'': John F. Kennedy, 1962, p. 347).</ref>

==Appearance and temperament==
Jefferson was six feet, two-and-one-half inches (189 cm) in height, slender, erect and sinewy. He had angular features, a very ruddy complexion, [[strawberry blonde|strawberry blond]] hair and hazel-flecked, grey eyes.  He was a poor public speaker who mumbled through his most important addresses.  There was grace, nevertheless, in his manners; and his frank and earnest address, his quick sympathy (though he seemed cold to strangers), and his vivacious, desultory, informing talk gave him an engaging charm. He was a man of intense convictions and an emotional temperament.  In later years, he was negligent in dress and loose in bearing.

"The Sage of Monticello" also cultivated an image that earned him the other nickname, "Man of the People".  He affected a popular air by greeting White House guests in homespun attire like a robe and slippers.  [[Dolley Madison]], wife of James Madison (Jefferson's secretary of state), and Jefferson's daughters relaxed White House protocol and turned formal state dinners into more casual and entertaining social events.[http://caracas.usembassy.gov/wwwh272.html][http://www.americanpresident.org/history/thomasjefferson/biography/FamilyLife.common.shtml]Although a foremost defender of a free press, Jefferson at times sparred with partisan newspapers and appealed to the people.[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/WWjefferson.htm]

Jefferson's writings were utilitarian and evidenced great intellect, and he had an affinity for languages.  He learned [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] in order to translate [[Ossian]], and sent to [[James Macpherson]] for the originals.

As President, he discontinued the practice of delivering the [[State of the Union Address]] in person, instead sending the address to Congress in writing (the practice was eventually revived by [[Woodrow Wilson]]); he gave only two public speeches during his Presidency. Jefferson had a lisp{{fact}} and preferred writing to public speaking partly because of this. He burned all of his letters between himself and his wife at her death, creating the portrait of a man who at times could be very private. Indeed, he preferred working in the privacy of his office than the public eye.[http://www.futurecasts.com/Ellis,%20Jefferson,%20American%20Sphinx.htm]

==Early life and education==
Thomas Jefferson was born on [[April 13]], [[1743]] (Gregorian N.S)  into a prosperous Virginia family, the third of ten children. His mother was [[Jane Randolph Jefferson|Jane Randolph]], daughter of [[Isham Randolph]], and a cousin of [[Peyton Randolph]].  Jefferson's father was [[Peter Jefferson]], a planter and surveyor who owned plantations in [[Albemarle County, Virginia|Albemarle County]] (Shadwell, then [[Edge Hill, Virginia]].)

[[Image:Reproduction-of-the-1805-Rembrandt-Peale-painting-of-Thomas-Jefferson-New-York-Historical-Society 1.jpg|thumb|right|Painting of Jefferson by [[Rembrandt Peale]] (1805)]] 
In 1752, Jefferson began attending a local school run by [[William Douglas]], a Scottish minister. At the age of nine, Jefferson began studying Latin and Greek &mdash; as well as French. In 1757, when he was 14 years old, his father died.  Jefferson inherited about 5,000 acres (20 km²) of land and dozens of [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]]. He built his home there, which eventually became known as [[Monticello]].  

After his father's death, he was taught at the school of the learned minister [[James Maury]] from 1758 to 1760. The school was in Fredericksville Parish near [[Gordonsville, Virginia]], twelve miles from Shadwell, and Jefferson boarded with Maury's family. There he received a [[classical education]] and studied history and science. 

In 1760 Jefferson entered the [[College of William and Mary]] in [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] at the age of 16; he studied there for two years, graduating with highest honors in 1762. At William & Mary, he enrolled in the philosophy school and studied mathematics, metaphysics, and philosophy under W&M Professor [[William Small]], who introduced the enthusiastic Jefferson to the writings of the [[British Empiricists]], including [[John Locke]], [[Francis Bacon (philosopher)|Francis Bacon]], and [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]] (Jefferson would later refer to them as the "three greatest men the world had ever produced"<ref>Merrill D. Peterson, ''Thomas Jefferson: Writings'', p. 1236</ref>). He also perfected his French, carried his Greek grammar book wherever he went, practiced the violin, and read [[Tacitus]] and [[Homer]]. A keen and diligent student, Jefferson displayed an avid curiosity in all fields and, according to family tradition, frequently studied fifteen hours a day. His closest college friend, John Page of Rosewell, reported that Jefferson "could tear himself away from his dearest friends, to fly to his studies."  

In college, Jefferson was a member of the secret [[Flat Hat Club]], now the namesake of the William & Mary daily student newspaper. He lodged and boarded at the College in the building known today as the Sir Christopher [[Wren Building]], attending communal meals in the Great Hall and morning and evening prayers in the Wren Chapel. Jefferson often attended the lavish parties of royal governor [[Francis Fauquier]] where he played his violin and developed an early love for wines. [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/03/books/chapters/1203-1st-hail.html]After graduating in 1762 with highest honors, he studied law with his friend and mentor, [[George Wythe]], and was admitted to the Virginia bar in 1767.

In 1772, Jefferson married a 23-year-old widow, [[Martha Wayles Skelton]]. They had six children: [[Martha Jefferson Randolph]] (1772-1836), Jane Randolph (1774-1775), a stillborn or unnamed son (1777-1777), Mary Wayles (1778-1804), Lucy Elizabeth (1780-1781), and Lucy Elizabeth (1782-1785). Martha died on [[September 6]], [[1782]] and Jefferson never remarried.

==Political career from 1774 to 1800==
[[Image:Jefferson Memorial with Declaration preamble.jpg|thumb|right|Rudolph Evans' statue of Jefferson with the [[Declaration of Independence (United States)|Declaration of Independence]] preamble to the right]]
===Colonial Legislator===
Jefferson practiced law and served in the Virginia [[House of Burgesses]].  In 1774, he wrote [http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/jeffsumm.htm ''A Summary View of the Rights of British America''], which was intended as instructions for the Virginia delegates to a national congress.  The pamphlet was a powerful argument of American terms for a settlement with Britain. It helped speed the way to independence, and marked Jefferson as one of the most thoughtful patriot spokesmen. 
===The Second Continental Congress===
Jefferson was the primary author of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and a contributor to American political and civil culture. The [[Continental Congress]] delegated the task of writing the Declaration to a [[Committee of Five]] that unanimously solicited Jefferson, considered the best writer, to write the first draft, and in fact wrote all of them. 
  
===State legislator===
In September 1776, Jefferson returned to Virginia and was elected to the new [[Virginia House of Delegates]].  During his term in the House, Jefferson set out to reform and update Virginia's system of laws to reflect its new status as a democratic state.  He drafted 126 bills in three years, including laws to abolish [[primogeniture]], establish [[freedom of religion]], and streamline the judicial system.  In 1778, Jefferson's "Bill for the More General Diffusion of Knowledge" led to several academic reforms at his ''alma mater'', including an elective system of study &mdash; the first in an American university.

[[Image:Declaration independence.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[John Trumbull]]'s famous painting is usually incorrectly identified as a depiction of the signing of the Declaration. What the painting actually depicts is the [[Committee of Five|five-man drafting committee]] presenting their work to the Congress. Trumbull's painting can also be found on the back of the U.S. [[United States Two dollar bill|$2 bill]].<ref>http://www.americanrevolution.org/deckey.html</ref>]]
===Governor of Virginia===
Jefferson served as [[governor of Virginia]] from 1779-1781.  As governor, he oversaw the transfer of the state capitol from Williamsburg to the more central location of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] in 1780.  He continued to advocate educational reforms at the College of William and Mary, including the nation's first student-policed [[honor code]]. In 1779, at Jefferson's behest, William and Mary appointed [[George Wythe]] to be the first professor of law in an American university.  Dissatisfied with the rate of changes he wanted to push through, he would go on later in life to become the [[Thomas Jefferson#Father of a university|"father"]] and founder of the [[University of Virginia]], which was the first university at which higher education was completely separate from religious doctrine.  

Virginia was invaded twice by the British during Jefferson's term as governor.  He, along with [[Patrick Henry]] and other Virginia Patriot leaders, were but ten minutes away from being captured by [[Banastre Tarleton]], a British colonel leading a cavalry column that was raiding the area in June 1781.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bennett|first=William J.|authorlink=William Bennett|title=America: The Last Best Hope (Volume I): From the Age of Discovery to a World at War|publisher=Nelson Current|year=2006|pages=99 |chapter=The Greatest Revolution|id= ISBN 1-59555-055-0}}</ref>  Public disapproval of his performance delayed his future political prospects, and he was never again elected to office in Virginia.<ref>Ferling, John  ''Adams vs Jefferson'' 2004 p 26</ref>  

===Minister to France===

From 1785–1789, Jefferson served as minister to [[France]]. He did not attend the [[United States Constitutional Convention|Constitutional Convention]].  He did generally support the new Constitution, although he thought the document flawed for lack of a [[Bill of Rights]].

===Secretary of State===
After returning from France, Jefferson served as the first [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] under [[George Washington]] (1789&ndash;1793). Jefferson and [[Alexander Hamilton]] began sparring over national [[fiscal policy]], especially the funding of the debts of the war.  In further sparring with the Federalists, Jefferson came to equate Hamilton and the rest of the Federalists with Tories and monarchists who threatened to undermine republicanism.  In the late 1790s, he worried that "Hamiltonianism" was taking hold.  He equated this with "Royalism", and made a point to state that "Hamiltonians were panting after...and itching for crowns, coronets and mitres".<ref>Ferling p 59</ref>  Jefferson and [[James Madison]] founded and led the Republican party, which eventually became [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)]].  He worked with Madison and his campaign manager [[John J. Beckley]] to build a nationwide network of Republican allies to combat Federalists across the country &mdash; what historians call the [[First Party System]].   

Jefferson strongly supported France against Britain when war broke out between those nations in 1793.  Historian Lawrence S. Kaplan notes Jefferson's "visceral support for the French cause," while agreeing with Washington that the nation should not get involved in the fighting. <ref> "Foreign Affairs," in Peterson, ed. ''Thomas Jefferson: A Reference Encyclopedia'' (1986) p 325 </ref> The arrival in 1793 of an aggressive new French minister, [[Citizen Genêt]] caused a crisis for the Secretary of State, as he watched Genêt try to violate American neutrality, manipulate public opinion, and even go over Washington's head in appealing to the people; projects which Jefferson helped to thwart. As Schachner observes that Jefferson believed that political success at home depended on the success of the French army in Europe:<ref> Schachner 1:495</ref>
:Jefferson still clung to his sympathies with France and hoped for the success of her arms abroad and a cordial compact with her at home. He was afraid that any French reverses on the European battlefields would give "wonderful vigor to our monocrats, and unquestionably affect the tone of administering our government. Indeed, I fear that if this summer should prove disastrous to the French, it will damp that energy of republicanism in our new Congress, from which I had hoped so much reformation."
===A Break from office===
Jefferson at the end of 1793 retired to Monticello where he continued to orchestrate opposition to Hamilton and Washington.  However, the [[Jay Treaty]] of 1794, orchestrated by Hamilton, brought peace and trade with Britain &mdash; while Madison, with strong support from Jefferson, wanted, Miller says, "to strangle the former mother country" without actually going to war. "It became an article of faith among Republicans that 'commercial weapons' would suffice to bring Great Britain to any terms the United States chose to dictate." Jefferson, in retirement, strongly encouraged Madison.<ref> Miller (1960), 143-4, 148-9. </ref>
===the 1796 Election and Vice Presidency===
As the Republican candidate in 1796 he lost to [[John Adams]], but had enough electoral votes to become [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] (1797&ndash;1801). He wrote a manual of parliamentary procedure, but otherwise avoided the Senate.

[[Image:TJeffersonrpeale.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Thomas Jefferson by [[Rembrandt Peale]], [[1800]]]]
With a [[quasi-War]] with France underway (that is, an undeclared naval war), the [[Federalists]] under [[John Adams]] started a navy, built up the army, levied new taxes, readied for war and enacted the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]] in 1798.  Jefferson interpreted the Alien and Sedition Acts as an attack on his party more than on dangerous enemy aliens; they were used to attack his party, most notably [[Matthew Lyon]], Congressman from [[Vermont]].  He and Madison rallied support by anonymously writing the [[Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions]] which declared that the federal government had no right to exercise powers not specifically delegated to it by the states. Should the federal government assume such powers, its acts under them could be voided by a state.  The Resolutions' importance lies in being the first statements of the [[states' rights]] theory that led to the later concepts of [[nullification]] and [[interposition]].

===The election of 1800===

Working closely with [[Aaron Burr]] of New York, Jefferson rallied his party, attacking the new taxes especially, and [[U.S. presidential election, 1800|stood for the Presidency]] in 1800.  Consistent with the traditions of the times, he did not formally campaign for the position.  Prior to the passage of the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|12th Amendment]], a problem with the new union's electoral system arose.  He tied with Burr for first place in the [[Electoral College]], leaving the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] (where the lame duck Federalists still had some power) to decide the election.

After lengthy debate within the Federalist-controlled House, Hamilton convinced his party that Jefferson would be a lesser political evil than Burr and that such scandal within the electoral process would undermine the still-young regime.  The issue was resolved by the House, on [[February 17]], [[1801]] after thirty-six ballots, when Jefferson was elected President and Burr Vice President.  Burr's refusal to remove himself from consideration would create a divide between Jefferson and Burr and lead to Jefferson replacing Burr as Vice President in Jefferson's second term.

During Jefferson's term as president, [[William A. Burwell]] was his private secretary.

==Father of a university==
[[Image:Lawn.jpg|thumb|180px|[[The Lawn]], [[University of Virginia]]]]
After leaving the Presidency, Jefferson continued to be active in public affairs.  He also became increasingly obsessed with founding a new institution of higher learning, specifically one free of church influences where students could specialize in [[University of Virginia#History|many new areas]] not offered at other universities. A letter to [[Joseph Priestley]], in January 1800, indicated that he had been planning the university for decades before its establishment.

His dream was realized in 1819, with the founding of the [[University of Virginia]]. Upon its opening in 1825, it was then the first university to offer a full slate of elective courses to its students. One of the largest construction projects to that time in North America, it was notable for being centered about a library rather than a church. In fact, no campus chapel was included in his original plans. Until his death, he invited university students and faculty of the school to his home; [[Edgar Allan Poe]] was among them.

The university was designed as the capstone of the educational system of Virginia.  In his vision, any citizen of the [[Commonwealth (United States)|commonwealth]] could attend school with the sole criterion being ability.

==Jefferson's death==
Jefferson died on the [[Fourth of July]], [[1826]], the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, the same day as [[John Adams]]' death.  Thomas Jefferson was deep in debt when he died.  His possessions were sold at auction.  In 1831, Jefferson's 552 acres (223 hectares) were sold for $7,000 to [[James T. Barclay]]. Thomas Jefferson is buried on his [[Monticello]] estate, in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]].  In his will, he left Monticello to the United States to be used as a school for orphans of navy officers.  His [[epitaph]], written by him with an insistence that only his words and "not a word more" be inscribed, reads:

==Interests and activities==
Jefferson was an accomplished [[architect]] who was extremely influential in bringing the [[Palladian architecture|Neo-Palladian]] style&mdash;popular among the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] aristocracy of Britain&mdash;to the United States. The style was associated with Enlightenment ideas of [[republic]]an civic virtue and political liberty. Jefferson designed his famous home, [[Monticello]], near [[Charlottesville, Virginia]]; it included automatic doors, the first [[swivel chair]], and other convenient devices invented by Jefferson. Nearby is the only university ever to have been founded by a U.S. president, the [[University of Virginia]], of which the original [[curriculum]] and architecture Jefferson designed. Today, Monticello and the University of Virginia are together one of only four man-made [[World Heritage Site]]s in the United States of America. Jefferson also designed [[Poplar Forest]], near [[Lynchburg, Virginia|Lynchburg]], in [[Bedford County, Virginia]], as a private retreat from a very public life. Jefferson is also credited with the architectural design of the [[Virginia State Capitol]] building, which was modeled after the [[Maison Carrée]] at Nîmes in southern France, an ancient [[Roman temple]].  Jefferson's buildings helped initiate the ensuing American fashion for [[Federal style architecture]].

Jefferson's interests included archeology, a discipline then in its infancy. He has sometimes been called the ''"[[List of people known as the father or mother of something|father of archeology]]"'' in recognition of his role in developing [[excavation]] techniques. When exploring an [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] burial mound on his Virginia estate in 1784, Jefferson avoided the common practice of simply digging downwards until something turned up.  Instead, he cut a wedge out of the mound so that he could walk into it, look at the layers of occupation, and draw conclusions from them.

[[Image:Thomas Jefferson's Monticello Estate.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Monticello]]]]
Thomas Jefferson enjoyed his fish pond at Monticello.  It was around three feet (1 m) deep and mortar lined. He used the pond to keep fish that were recently caught as well as to keep eels fresh. This pond has been restored and can be seen from the west side of Monticello.  

In 1780, he joined [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s [[American Philosophical Society]]. He served as president of the society from 1797 to 1815.

Jefferson was an avid [[wine]] lover and noted gourmet. During his years in [[France]] (1784-1789) he took extensive trips through French and other [[Europe]]an wine regions and sent the best back home. He is noted for the bold pronouncement: "We could in the United States make as great a variety of wines as are made in Europe, not exactly of the same kinds, but doubtless as good." While there were extensive vineyards planted at Monticello, a significant portion were of the European wine grape ''[[Vitis vinifera]]'' and did not survive the many vine diseases native to the Americas.

In 1801, he published [http://www.constitution.org/tj/tj-mpp.htm ''A Manual of Parliamentary Practice''] that is still in use. In 1812 Jefferson published a second edition.

After the British burned Washington, D.C. and the [[Library of Congress]] in August 1814, Jefferson offered his own collection to the nation. In January 1815, Congress accepted his offer, appropriating $23,950 for his 6,487 books, and the foundation was laid for a great national library. Today, the [[Library of Congress]]' website for federal legislative information is named THOMAS, in honor of Jefferson.[http://thomas.loc.gov/]. His two volume 1764 edition of the [[Quran]] was used by [[Keith Ellison (politician)|Rep. Keith Ellison]] in 2007 [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qur%27an_oath_controversy_of_the_110th_United_States_Congress#Thomas_Jefferson.27s_Quran for his swearing in] to the U.S. House of representatives.<ref>{{cite news|title=But It's Thomas Jefferson's Koran!|authors=Amy Argetsinger and Roxanne Roberts| date=January 3, 2007|page=C03|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/03/AR2007010300075.html|publisher=The Washington Post}} Retrieved on Jan. 3, 2007</ref>

==Political philosophy==
[[Image:1818 letter Jefferson to Mordecai Noah.jpg|thumb|In his [[May 28]], [[1818]] letter to [[Mordecai Manuel Noah]], Jefferson expressed his faith in mankind and his  views on the nature of democracy.]]

Jefferson was a leader in developing [[Republicanism in the United States]].  The idea was that the British aristocratic system was inherently corrupt and that Americans devotion to civic virtue required independence.  In the 1790s he repeatedly warned that Hamilton and Adams were trying to impose a British-like monarchical system that threatened republicanism.  Jefferson's vision for American virtue was that of an agricultural nation of [[yeoman]] farmers minding their own affairs. It stood in contrast to the vision of [[Alexander Hamilton]], who envisioned a nation of commerce and manufacturing, which Jefferson said offered too many temptations to corruption. Jefferson's deep belief in the uniqueness and the potential of America made him the father of [[American exceptionalism]]. In particular, he was confident that an under-populated America could avoid what he considered the horrors of class-divided, industrialized Europe. Jefferson was influenced heavily by the ideas of many European Enlightenment thinkers. His political principles were heavily influenced by the [[Country party]] of 19th century opposition figures. He also was influenced by [[John Locke]] (particularly relating to the principle of [[inalienable rights]].) Historians find few traces of any influence by his French contemporary, [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].<ref> [[J. G. A. Pocock]], ''The Machiavellian Moment: Florentine Political Thought and the Atlantic Republican Tradition'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1975), 533; see also Richard K. Matthews, ''The Radical Politics of Thomas Jefferson'', (Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 1986), p. 17, 139n.16. </ref>

His opposition to the National Bank of the United States was epitomized by his famous quote from a letter to John Taylor, "And I sincerely believe, with you, that banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies; and that the principle of spending money to be paid by posterity, under the name of funding, is but swindling futurity on a large scale."<ref>Letter from Thomas Jefferson to John Taylor. In Jefferson, T., & Randolph, T. J. (1829). Memoir, correspondence, and miscellanies from the papers of Thomas Jefferson. Letter CXXXI, Monticello, May 28, 1816, p. 277. Charlottesville: F.

Jefferson believed that each individual has "certain unalienable rights." That is, these rights exist with or without government; man cannot create, take, or give them away. It is the right of "[[liberty]]" on which Jefferson is most notable for expounding. He defines it by saying "rightful liberty is unobstructed action according to our will within limits drawn around us by the equal rights of others. I do not add ‘within the limits of the law’, because law is often but the tyrant’s will, and always so when it violates the rights of the individual."<ref>Letter to Isaac H. Tiffany, 1819</ref>  Hence, for Jefferson, though government cannot ''create'' a right to liberty, it can indeed violate it. And the limit of an individual's rightful liberty is not what law says it is but is simply a matter of stopping short of prohibiting other individuals from having the same liberty. A proper government, for Jefferson, is one that not only prohibits individuals in society from infringing on the liberty of other individuals, but also restrains ''itself'' from diminishing individual liberty.  

Jefferson's commitment to equality was expressed in his successful efforts to abolish [[primogeniture]] in Virginia, the rule by which the first born son inherited all the land.<ref>Brown 1954 pp 51-2</ref>

Jefferson believed that individuals have an innate sense of [[morality]] that prescribes right from wrong when dealing with other individuals&mdash;that whether they choose to restrain themselves or not, they have an innate sense of the natural rights of others. He even believed that moral sense to be reliable enough that an [[anarchist]] society could function well, provided that it was reasonably small. On several occasions, he expressed admiration for [[Tribe|tribal]], communal way of living of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s:<ref>[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/JefVirg.html Notes on Virginia]</ref> In fact, Jefferson is sometimes seen as a [[philosophical anarchist]].<ref>Adler, Mortimer Jerome. The Great Ideas. Open Court Publishing 2000. p. 378</ref>

He said in a ''letter to Colonel Carrington'': "I am convinced that those societies (as the Indians) which live without government, enjoy in their general mass an infinitely greater degree of happiness than those who live under the European governments." However, Jefferson believed [[anarchism]] to be "inconsistent with any great degree of population.".<ref>''[http://odur.let.rug.nl/~usa/P/tj3/writings/brf/jefl53.htm Letter to James Madison], 30 Jan 1787''</ref> Hence, he did advocate government for the American expanse provided that it exists by "consent of the governed."

In the Preamble to his original draft of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], Jefferson wrote:
{{Cquote|''We hold these truths to be sacred & undeniable; that all men are created equal & independent, that from that equal creation they derive rights inherent & inalienable, among which are the preservation of life, & liberty, & the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these ends, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed; that whenever any form of government shall become destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, & to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles & organising its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety & happiness.''<ref>[http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/declara/ruffdrft.html Professor Julian Boyd's reconstruction of Jefferson's "original Rough draught" of the Declaration of Independence]</ref>}}

Jefferson's dedication to "consent of the governed" was so thorough that he believed that individuals could not be morally bound by the actions of preceding generations. This included debts as well as law. He said that "no society can make a perpetual constitution or even a perpetual law. The earth belongs always to the living generation." He even calculated what he believed to be the proper cycle of legal revolution: "Every constitution then, and every law, naturally expires at the end of 19 years. If it is to be enforced longer, it is an act of force, and not of right." He arrived at 19 years through calculations with expectancy of life tables, taking into account what he believed to be the age of "maturity"&mdash;when an individual is able to reason for himself.<ref>''[http://odur.let.rug.nl/~usa/P/tj3/writings/brf/jefl81.htm Letter to James Madison], 6 September 1789''</ref> He also advocated that the [[National Debt]] should be eliminated. He did not believe that living individuals had a moral obligation to repay the debts of previous generations. He said that repaying such debts was "a question of generosity and not of right".<ref>''[http://odur.let.rug.nl/~usa/P/tj3/writings/brf/jefl81.htm Letter to James Madison], 6 Sep 1789</ref>

Jefferson's very strong defense of [[States' Rights]], especially in the [[Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions]] of 1798, set the tone for hostility to expansion of federal powers.  However, some of his foreign policies did in fact strengthen the government.  Most important was the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803, when he used the implied powers to annex a huge foreign territory and all its French and Indian inhabitants. His enforcement of the [[Embargo Act]], while it failed in terms of foreign policy, demonstrated that the federal government could intervene with great force at the local level in controlling trade that might lead to war. 

Jefferson was influenced by [[Wawrzyniec Grzymala Goslicki]]'s book ''De optimo senatore'', and in his works paraphrased some of Goslicki's phrases from the book.[http://info-poland.buffalo.edu/classroom/constitution.html] [http://www.citinet.net/ak/polska_02_f2.html] [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0013-2586(198123)15%3A1%3C108%3ASROTPP%3E2.0.CO%3B2-Y] [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0026-2234(199905)97%3A6%3C2062%3AFRPTPR%3E2.0.CO%3B2-W]

===Views on the judiciary===
Although trained as a lawyer, Jefferson was never comfortable in court.  He believed that judges should be technical specialists but should not set policy.  He denounced the 1801 Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'' as a violation of democracy, but he did not have enough support in Congress to propose a Constitutional amendment to overturn it.  He continued to oppose the doctrine of [[judicial review]]: 
{{Cquote|''To consider the judges as the ultimate arbiters of all constitutional questions [is] a very dangerous doctrine indeed, and one which would place us under the despotism of an oligarchy. Our judges are as honest as other men and not more so. They have with others the same passions for party, for power, and the privilege of their corps. Their maxim is ''boni judicis est ampliare jurisdictionem'' [good justice is broad jurisdiction], and their power the more dangerous as they are in office for life and not responsible, as the other functionaries are, to the elective control. The Constitution has erected no such single tribunal, knowing that to whatever hands confided, with the corruptions of time and party, its members would become despots. It has more wisely made all the departments co-equal and co-sovereign within themselves.''<ref>Letter to William C. Jarvis, 1820</ref>}}

==Religious views==
[[Image:Original Declaration of Independence NARA.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] incorporates concepts from [[Deism]].]]

On matters of religion, Jefferson in 1800 was accused by his political opponents of being an atheist and enemy of religion. But Jefferson wrote at length on religion and many scholars agree with the claim that Jefferson was a [[deist]], a common position held by intellectuals in the late 18th century. As [[Avery Cardinal Dulles]], a leading Roman Catholic theologian reports, "In his college years at William and Mary he [Jefferson] came to admire [[Francis Bacon]], [[Isaac Newton]], and [[John Locke]] as three great paragons of wisdom. Under the influence of several professors he converted to the deist philosophy."<ref>, Avery Cardinal Dulles, "The Deist Minimum" ''First Things: A Monthly Journal of Religion and Public Life''  Issue: 149. (Jan 2005) pp 25+ http://www.firstthings.com/ftissues/ft0501/articles/dulles.htm</ref> Dulles concludes:
{{Cquote|''In summary, then, Jefferson was a deist because he believed in one God, in divine providence, in the divine moral law, and in rewards and punishments after death; but did not believe in supernatural revelation. He was a Christian deist because he saw Christianity as the highest expression of natural religion and Jesus as an incomparably great moral teacher. He was not an [[orthodox Christian]] because he rejected, among other things, the doctrines that Jesus was the promised Messiah and the incarnate Son of God. Jefferson's religion is fairly typical of the American form of deism in his day.''}}

Biographer Merrill Peterson summarizes Jefferson's theology:
{{Cquote|''First, that the Christianity of the churches was unreasonable, therefore unbelievable, but that stripped of priestly mystery, ritual, and dogma, reinterpreted in the light of historical evidence and human experience, and substituting the Newtonian cosmology for the discredited Biblical one, Christianity could be conformed to reason. Second, morality required no divine sanction or inspiration, no appeal beyond reason and nature, perhaps not even the hope of heaven or the fear of hell; and so the whole edifice of Christian revelation came tumbling to the ground.''<ref>Peterson 1975 p 50-51</ref>}} 

Jefferson used deist terminology in repeatedly stating his belief in a [[Creator god|creator]], and in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] used the terms "Creator", "Nature's God". Jefferson believed, furthermore, it was this Creator that endowed humanity with a number of inalienable rights, such as "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness".  His experience in France just before the French Revolution made him deeply suspicious of Catholic priests and bishops as a force for reaction and ignorance. Similarly, his experience in America with inter-denominational intolerance served to reinforce this skeptical view of religion. In a letter to [[Willam Short]], Jefferson wrote: "the serious enemies are the priests of the different religious sects, to whose spells on the human mind its improvement is ominous."<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/mtj:@field(DOCID+@lit(ws03101)) Letter to William Short, April 13, 1820]</ref>

Jefferson was raised in the [[Church of England]], at a time when it was the [[State religion|established church]] in Virginia and only denomination funded by Virginia tax money.  Before the Revolution, Jefferson was a [[vestryman]] in his local church, a lay position that was part of political office at the time.  He also had friends who were clergy, and he supported some churches financially.  During his Presidency, Jefferson attended the weekly church services held in the House of Representatives.  Jefferson later expressed general agreement with his friend [[Joseph Priestley]]'s [[Unitarianism]], that is the  rejection of the doctrine of Trinity. In a letter to a pioneer in Ohio he wrote, "I rejoice that in this blessed country of free inquiry and belief, which has surrendered its conscience to neither kings or priests, the genuine doctrine of only one God is reviving, and I trust that there is not a young man now living in the United States who will not die a Unitarian."<ref>[http://lachlan.bluehaze.com.au/lit/jeff17.htm Letter to Dr. Benjamin Waterhouse] [[June 26]] [[1822]]</ref>

Jefferson did not believe in the divinity of Jesus, but he had high esteem for Jesus' moral teachings, which he viewed as the "principles of a pure deism, and juster notions of the attributes of God, to reform [prior Jewish] moral doctrines to the standard of reason, justice & philanthropy, and to inculcate the belief of a future state."<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC02031532&id=4dnSClToke0C&pg=PA374&lpg=PR18&dq=%22Joseph+Priestley,+April+9,+1803%22 Letter to Joseph Priestley, April 9 1803], Thomas Jefferson. Lipscomb and Bergh, eds., ''The Writings of Thomas Jefferson,'' vol. x, p.374 </ref>  Jefferson did not believe in miracles. He made his own condensed version of the Gospels, omitting Jesus' virgin birth, miracles, divinity, and resurrection, primarily leaving only Jesus' moral philosophy, of which he approved. This compilation was published after his death and became known as the ''[[Jefferson Bible]]''. 

{{Cquote|''[The Jefferson Bible] is a document in proof that I am a ''real Christian'', that is to say, a disciple of the doctrines of Jesus, very different from the Platonists, who call ''me'' infidel and ''themselves'' Christians and preachers of the gospel, while they draw all their characteristic dogmas from what its author never said nor saw.''<ref>Letter to Charles Thomson 9 January 1816</ref>}} 

In spite of evidence pointing to a life of deism or progressive Christianity, however, it has been suggested that at the end of his days, Jefferson's leanings may have been closer to that of an atheist.  Noted scholar and polemicist [[Christopher Hitchens]] cites several of Jefferson's letters to friends as he approached his death, stating that he awaited his end without "either hope or fear."  Hitchens also notes an earlier correspondence with nephew Peter Carr, cautioning against shying away from confronting the possible absence of a god due to "any fear of its consequences."<ref>Christopher Hitchens, Thomas Jefferson: Author of America, Page 182, paperback edition.</ref>  Though an individual's inner feelings can never truly be known, these correspondences most certainly indicate a gulf between his public and private religious leanings.

===Church and state===
[[Image:Jefferson Two Dollar Bill Closeup.jpg|thumb|right|Jefferson is portrayed on the [[United States two-dollar bill]].]]
For Jefferson, separation of church and state was not an abstract right but a necessary reform of the religious "tyranny" of one Christian sect over many other Christians - and of the interference of the state in affairs of religion. Jefferson tried re-instating a new religion for all to use, but this idea quickly failed and Jefferson was almost removed from office.

Following the Revolution, Jefferson played a leading role in the disestablishment of religion in Virginia. Previously the Anglican Church had tax support.  As he wrote in his ''Notes on Virginia'', a law was in effect in Virginia that "if a person brought up a Christian denies the being of a God, or the Trinity …he is punishable on the first offense by incapacity to hold any office …; on the second by a disability to sue, to take any gift or legacy …, and by three year' imprisonment." Prospective officer-holders were required to swear that they did not believe in the central Roman Catholic doctrine of [[transubstantiation]].

From 1784 to 1786, Jefferson and James Madison worked together to oppose [[Patrick Henry]]'s attempts to again assess taxes in Virginia to support churches. Instead, in 1786, the [[Virginia General Assembly]] passed Jefferson's ''[[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom|Bill for Religious Freedom]]'', which he had first submitted in 1779 and was one of only three accomplishments he put in his own epitaph.  The law read:
{{Cquote|''No man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or burdened in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer, on account of his religious opinions or belief; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities.''<ref>Merrill D. Peterson, ed., ''Thomas Jefferson: Writings'' (1984), p. 347</ref>}}

One of Jefferson’s least well known writings is: "Millions of innocent men, women and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been burned, tortured, fined and imprisoned. What has been the effect of this coercion? To make half the world fools and half hypocrites; to support roguery and error all over the world"- Thomas Jefferson, in his Notes on Virginia. [http://www.deeknow.com/wiki/view.pl/Quotes]

Jefferson sought what he called a "wall of separation between Church and State", which he believed was a principle expressed by the [[First Amendment]].  This phrase has been cited several times by the Supreme Court in its interpretation of the [[Establishment Clause]].<ref>Reynolds (98 U.S. at 164, 1879); Everson (330 U.S. at 59, 1947); McCollum (333 U.S. at 232, 1948) </ref>  In an 1802 letter to the [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] [[Baptist]] Association, he wrote: 

{{Cquote|''Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legislative powers of government reach actions only, and not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should "make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof," thus building a [[wall of separation]] between church and State.''<ref>[[Wikisource:Jefferson letter to Neremiah Dodge and others|Letter to Danbury Baptist Association, CT]], [[January 1]], [[1802]]</ref>}}

He used the phrase "wall of separation" again in an 1808 letter to Virginia Baptists:

{{Cquote|''Because religious belief, or non-belief, is such an important part of every person's life, freedom of religion affects every individual. State churches that use government power to support themselves and force their views on persons of other faiths undermine all our civil rights. Moreover, state support of the church tends to make the clergy unresponsive to the people and leads to corruption within religion. Erecting the 'wall of separation between church and state,' therefore, is absolutely essential in a free society.<ref> Letter to the Virginia Baptists (1808)</ref>}}

During his Presidency, Jefferson refused to issue proclamations calling for days of prayer and thanksgiving. Moreover, his private letters indicate he was skeptical of too much interference by [[clergy]] in matters of civil government. His letters contain the following observations: "History, I believe, furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people maintaining a free civil government",<ref>Letter to [[Alexander von Humboldt]], [[December 6]], [[1813]]</ref> and, "In every country and in every age, the priest has been hostile to liberty. He is always in alliance with the [[despot]], abetting his abuses in return for protection to his own."<ref>Letter to [[Horatio G. Spafford]], [[March 17]], [[1814]]</ref> "May it be to the world, what I believe it will be, (to some parts sooner, to others later, but finally to all), the signal of arousing men to burst the chains under which monkish ignorance and superstition had persuaded them to bind themselves, and to assume the blessings and security of self-government".<ref>Letter to [[Roger C. Weightman]] [[June 24]], [[1826]]</ref>

Jefferson owned many slaves over his lifetime. Some find it baffling that Thomas Jefferson owned slaves yet was outspoken in saying that slavery was immoral and it should be abolished. Biographers point out that Jefferson was deep in debt and had encumbered his slaves by notes and mortgages; he could not free them until he finally was debt-free, which he never was.<ref>Herbert E. Sloan, ''Principle and Interest: Thomas Jefferson and the Problem of Debt'' (2001) pp. 14-26, 220-1. </ref>

During his long career in public office, Jefferson attempted numerous times to abolish or limit the advance of slavery.  According to a biographer, Jefferson "believed that it was the responsibility of the state and society to free all slaves".<ref>Willard Sterne Randall, ''Thomas Jefferson: A Life''.  p 593.</ref>  In 1769, as a member of the [[House of Burgesses]], Jefferson proposed for that body to emancipate slaves in Virginia, but he was unsuccessful.<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/mtj:@field(DOCID%2B@lit(tj010010)) The Works of Thomas Jefferson in Twelve Volumes] at the Library of Congress.</ref>  In his first draft of the [[Declaration of Independence (United States)|Declaration of Independence]] (1776), Jefferson condemned the British crown for sponsoring the importation of slavery to the colonies, charging that the crown "has waged cruel war against [[human nature]] itself, violating its most sacred rights of life and liberty in the persons of a distant people who never offended him, captivating & carrying them into slavery in another [[Western Hemisphere|hemisphere]]." However, this language was dropped from the Declaration at the request of delegates from [[South Carolina]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

In 1778, the legislature passed a bill he proposed to ban further importation of slaves into Virginia; although this did not bring complete [[abolitionism|emancipation]], in his words, it "stopped the increase of the evil by importation, leaving to future efforts its final eradication."  In 1784, Jefferson's draft of what became the [[Northwest Ordinance]] stipulated that "there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude" in any of the new states admitted to the Union from the [[Northwest Territory]].<ref>[http://www.econlib.org/library/ypdbooks/lalor/llCy787.html Ordinance of 1787] Lalor Cyclopædia of Political Science</ref>  In 1807, he signed a bill abolishing the [[slave trade]].  Jefferson attacked the institution of slavery in his ''[[Notes on the State of Virginia]]'' (1784):
{{Cquote|''There must doubtless be an unhappy influence on the manners of our people produced by the existence of slavery among us. The whole commerce between master and slave is a perpetual exercise of the most boisterous passions, the most unremitting despotism on the one part, and degrading submissions on the other.<ref>''Notes on the State of Virginia'', Ch 18.</ref>''}} 

In this same work, Jefferson advanced his suspicion that blacks were inferior to whites "in the endowments both of body and mind".<ref>''Notes on the State of Virginia'' Query 14</ref> He also wrote, "Nothing is more certainly written in the book of fate than that these people are to be free. [But] the two races...cannot live in the same government. Nature, habit, opinion has drawn indelible lines of distinction between them." [http://www.americanpresident.org/history/thomasjefferson/biography/resources/Articles/KunhardtJefferson.article.shtml]  According to historian [[Stephen Ambrose]]: "Jefferson, like all slaveholders and many other white members of American society, regarded Negroes as inferior, childlike, untrustworthy and, of course, as property. Jefferson, the genius of politics, could see no way for African-Americans to live in society as free people. He embraced the worst forms of racism to justify slavery."<ref>[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/issues/2002/november/presence.php Flawed Founders] by Stephen E. Ambrose.</ref>  

The downturn in land prices after 1819 pushed Jefferson further into debt. Jefferson finally emancipated his five most trusted slaves; the others were sold after his death to pay his debts. <ref> Peterson (1975) 991-92, 1007.</ref>

====The Sally Hemings controversy====
:''For more details on this topic, see [[Sally Hemings]] and [[Jefferson DNA Data]].''
Although Jefferson wrote regarding [[miscegenation|marriage between blacks and whites]], "The amalgamation of whites with blacks produces a degradation to which no lover of his country, no lover of excellence in the human character, can innocently consent," a subject of considerable controversy since Jefferson's time is whether he was the father of any of the children of his slave [[Sally Hemings]]. Hemings was likely the half-sister of Jefferson's deceased wife [[Martha Wayles Skelton Jefferson]]. The allegation that Jefferson fathered children with Hemings first gained widespread public attention in 1802, when journalist James T. Callender, wrote in a Richmond newspaper, "... [Jefferson] keeps and for many years has kept, as his concubine, one of his slaves. Her name is Sally." Jefferson never responded publicly about this issue but is said to have denied it in his private correspondence.<ref>[http://www.ashbrook.org/articles/mayer-hemings.html#VIA  The Thomas Jefferson - Sally Hemings Myth and the Politicization of American History]</ref>

A 1998 [[DNA]] study concluded that there was a DNA link between some of Hemings descendants and the Jefferson family, but did not conclusively prove that Jefferson himself was their ancestor.  Three studies were released in the early 2000s, following the publication of the DNA evidence. In 2000, the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, which runs Monticello, appointed a multi-disciplinary, 9-member in-house research committee of Ph.D.s and an M.D. to study the matter of the paternity of Hemings's children.  The committee concluded "it is very unlikely that any Jefferson other than Thomas Jefferson was the father of [Hemings's six] children."<ref>[http://www.monticello.org/plantation/hemingscontro/appendixj.html Report of the Research Committee on Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings, Appendix J: The Possible Paternity of Other Jeffersons, A Summary of Research]</ref> In 2001, the Thomas Jefferson Heritage Society<ref>[http://www.tjheritage.org/scholars.html The Scholars Commission on the Jefferson-Hemings Issue]</ref> commissioned a study by an independent 13-member Scholars Commission. The commission concluded that the Jefferson paternity thesis was not persuasive. The ''National Genealogical Society Quarterly'' then published articles reviewing the evidence from a genealogical perspective and concluded that the link between Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings was valid.<ref>Helen F. M. Leary, "Sally Hemings's Children: A Genealogical Analysis of the Evidence," National Genealogical Society Quarterly, Vol. 89, no. 3 (Sep. 2001), 165-207. [http://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/0205/hemings.html]</ref>
Interestly a 2006 study by [[Leicester University]] found that Thomas Jefferson himself may have had ancesters from "north-east Africa or the Middle East" as it was found that his Y chromosome belonged to a [[haplogroup]] known as [[Haplogroup_K_%28Y-DNA%29|K2]] which is apparently "rare in Europe and has not yet been reported in Britain", this would be important as Jefferson's father claimed Welsh ancestry.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6293333.stm news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6293333.stm] (See last Paragraph)</ref>

Thus, in 1796, the [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] fielded Jefferson as a Presidential candidate, but he came in second and therefore became Vice President.}}
