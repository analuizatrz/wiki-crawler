{{nihongo|'''Keichū'''|契沖|}}, [[1640]] – 3 April [[1701]]) was a priest of the [[Shingon]] sect and a scholar of [[Kokugaku]] in the mid [[Edo period]].

Keichū’s grandfather was a personal retainer of [[Kato Kiyomasa]] but his father was a [[ronin]] from the [[Amagasaki]] fief.

When he was young, Keichū studied at Kaijō in [[Myōhōji]], [[Imasato]], [[Osaka]]. He attained the post of [[Ajari]] (or Azari) at [[Mount Koya|Mount Kōya]]. 

Following this he became chief priest at Mandara-in in [[Ikutama]], [[Osaka]], during which time he was friendly with [[Shimokobe Nagaru]]. However, he disliked the worldly duties of his work and, after wandering around the Kinki region for a while, made his way back to Mount Koya. He later read widely in Japanese classics under the patronage of [[Fuseya Shigeta]], a patron of the arts in [[Izumi Province]]. After serving as chief priest at Myohoji, Keichū spent his last years at Enju’an in [[Kōzu]] in the Province of [[Settsu province|Settsu]].

His prolific works set a new standard in the study of the classics, and included the ''Man’yōdai Shōshū'' (commissioned by [[Tokugawa Mitsukuni]]), the ''Kōganshō'', the ''Kokin Yozaishō'', the ''Seigodan'', the ''Genchū Shūi'', the ''[[Hyakunin Isshu]] Kaikanshō'', and the ''[[Waji]] Shōranshō''.
