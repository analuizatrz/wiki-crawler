'''''The Lion King''''' is a 1994 [[animated feature]] film produced by [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]] and released by [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. It is the 32nd [[animated feature]] in the [[List of Disney animated features|Disney animated feature]] canon, and the third highest-grossing animated feature film ever released in the [[United States]].

The film focuses on a young [[lion]] in [[Africa]] named [[Simba]], who learns of his place in the "Circle of Life" while struggling through various obstacles to become the rightful king. It is frequently alleged that ''The Lion King'' was based on [[Osamu Tezuka]]'s 1960s animated series ''[[Kimba the White Lion]]'', although many of the filmmakers deny this.<ref name="The Straight Dope">{{cite web | work=straightdope.com | title=Did Disney's ''The Lion King'' rip off an old Japanese TV series?|url=http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a991224.html| accessdate=16 September|accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref name="Craig Anderson">{{cite web | work=kimbawlion.com | title=Remake of Tezuka's Popular Story Turns Into Denial?|url=http://www.kimbawlion.com/rant2.htm| accessdate=24 September|accessyear=2006}}</ref> The filmmakers do, however, acknowledge the prominent influences of the [[Shakespeare]] play ''[[Hamlet]]'', the [[Bible]] stories of [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] and [[Moses]], and the 1942 Disney animated feature ''[[Bambi]]''.<ref name="storyinspiration">{{cite video | people = Don Hahn, Roger Allers, Rob Minkoff | title = The Lion King: Platinum Edition (Disc 2)  | medium = DVD  | publisher = Walt Disney Home Video  | date = 2003}}</ref>

''The Lion King'' is a musical film, with songs written by composer [[Elton John]] and lyricist [[Tim Rice]], and a film score by [[Hans Zimmer]]. The score and one of its songs went on to win [[Academy Award]]s.<ref name="boxofficemojo">{{cite web | work=boxofficemojo.com- 1994 Academy Awards | title=''The Lion King'' - 1994 Academy Awards |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/oscar/movies/?id=lionking.htm| accessdate=17 September|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

==Production==
''The Lion King'' was originally called ''King of the Jungle'' during early stages of production.<ref name="kingofthejungle">{{cite web | work=The Lion King (1994) | title=The Lion King (1994) |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110357/| accessdate=12 September|accessyear=2006}}</ref> Like ''[[Bambi]]'', animators studied real-life animals for reference, and some of the filmmakers went to [[Africa]] to observe the natural habitat that would be shown in the film.<ref>''The Lion King'': Platinum Edition DVD, Disc 2, 'Production Research Trip'</ref>

The film's significant use of computers helped the filmmakers to present their vision in new ways.  The most notable use of [[computer animation]] is in the "wildebeest stampede" sequence.  Several distinct wildebeest characters were built in a 3D computer program, multiplied into the hundreds, [[cel shading|cel shaded]] to look like drawn animation, and given randomized paths down a mountainside to simulate the real, unpredictable movement of a herd. Similar multiplication occurs in the "Be Prepared" musical number with identical marching hyenas.<ref>''The Lion King'': Platinum Edition DVD, Disc 2, 'Computer Animation'</ref>

''The Lion King'' was once considered a secondary project to ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'', both of which were in production at the same time. Most of the Disney Feature Animation staff preferred to work on ''Pocahontas'', believing it would be the more prestigious and successful of the two.<ref>''The Lion King'': Platinum Edition DVD, Disc 2, 'Origins'</ref> However, when the two films were released, ''The Lion King'' received much more positive feedback than ''Pocahontas'', but ''Pocahontas'' still became a success. <ref name="rottentomatoestlk">{{cite web | work=Rotten Tomatoes | title=Rotten Tomatoes - The Lion King |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lion_king/| accessdate=24 September|accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref name="rottentomatoespocahontas">{{cite web | work=Rotten Tomatoes | title=Rotten Tomatoes - ''Pocahontas'' |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1063809-pocahontas/| accessdate=17 September|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

==Plot==
[[Image:Lionkingopeningscene.JPG|thumb|290px|right|Rafiki holds Mufasa and Sarabi's newborn lion cub, Simba]]
The story of ''The Lion King'' takes place in the fictional Pride Lands of Africa, where a lion rules over the other animals as king.
 
At the beginning of the film, Rafiki the mandrill shaman presents Simba, the newborn cub of King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi, to a gathering of animals at Pride Rock. Meanwhile, Mufasa's brother Scar, realizes that he is no longer the heir to the throne and plots to kill Simba and Mufasa.

Scar plants curiousity in Simba about the elephant graveyard, a place beyond the borders of the Pride Lands where Mufasa has forbidden Simba to go. Simba takes his friend Nala to the elephant graveyard where the cubs are chased by the three [[hyena]]s Shenzi, Banzai and Ed, who are Scar's minions. Mufasa rescues the cubs. Scar, plotting further, gathers more hyenas and later engineers a [[wildebeest]] stampede down into a gorge where Simba is. Mufasa rescues his son from the stampede, but after an attempted climb to safety, Scar throws him back into the stampede to his death. Scar makes Simba believe that the young cub was responsible for his father's death and Simba flees the Pride Lands, ashamed and guilty. Scar assumes the throne.

Simba is found in the desert by Timon the meerkat and Pumbaa the warthog. The duo adopt and raise the cub in the jungle under their carefree Hakuna Matata lifestyle. When Simba is grown, he encounters his childhood friend Nala, who relays that Scar's tyrannical reign has destroyed the Pride Lands. She wants Simba to return and take his rightful place as king, but Simba refuses, still guilty about supposedly causing his father's death. After some advice from Rafiki and the ghost of his father, Simba realizes what he must do and returns home. Nala, Timon and Pumbaa join him.
[[Image:SimbaNala_NewCub.jpg|290px|thumb|left|Simba and Nala with their new cub, held by Rafiki]]
Once back at Pride Rock, Simba confronts his uncle and the truth about Mufasa's death is revealed by an overly confident Scar. A fierce battle breaks out between the hyenas and the lionesses and Simba and Scar. Simba eventually triumphs over his uncle and kicks him down to where the hyenas are waiting. Scar had blamed the hyenas for everything, angering them. The hyenas surround their fallen leader and kill him.

With the rightful king in place, the Pride Lands are restored. Rafiki lifts Simba and Nala's newborn cub high into their air, thus continuing the circle of life.

==Reaction==
''The Lion King'' became the second highest domestically-grossing film of 1994 (below ''[[Forrest Gump]]'').<ref name="movies">{{cite web | work= movies.com | title=Highest grossing movies of 1994 |url=http://movies.go.com/boxoffice?cat=1994| accessdate=18 September|accessyear=2006}}</ref> Critical response was also positive; ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' film critic [[Roger Ebert]] called the film "a superbly drawn animated feature"<ref name="Ebert">{{cite web | work=Chicago Sun Times| title=The Lion King review|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19940624/REVIEWS/406240301/1023| accessdate=31 August|accessyear=2006}}</ref>, and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called it "an impressive, almost daunting achievement".<ref name="washingtonpost">{{cite web | work=The Washington Post| title=The Lion King review|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/review96/lionkinghin.htm| accessdate=24 September|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

The film initially made [[United States dollar|US$]]312,855,561 domestically, but including its 2002 [[IMAX]] re-release the number would be $328,541,776. The initial gross includes the film's short return to theaters in November 1994.<ref name="boxoffice">{{cite web | work=Box Office Mojo | title=''The Lion King'' box office|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=lionking.htm| accessdate=30 July|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

It held the record for the most successful animated feature film in history until it was broken by the computer animated ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' in 2003. After ''[[Shrek 2]]'' surpassed ''Nemo'''s gross in 2004, it now ranks third, but remains the highest grossing film using traditional animation. When adjusted for inflation, it is the fourth top grossing animated film (below ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'' and ''[[Fantasia (film)|Fantasia]]''). It also holds the top spot in highest theater average gross in history.<ref name="boxoffice">{{cite web | work=Box Office Mojo | title=All Time Theater Gross Average|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/weekends/theateravg.htm|accessdate=17 September|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

==Music==
[[Elton John]] and [[Tim Rice]] wrote five original songs for this film, and John performs "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" during the end credits. However, the major musical praise focused on [[Hans Zimmer]]'s score which was supplemented with traditional African music and choir elements arranged by [[Lebo M]].<ref>''The Lion King'': Platinum Edition DVD, Disc 2, 'Music: African Influence'</ref>

''The Lion King'' is heavily influenced by American musical theater.<ref>''The Lion King'': Platinum Edition DVD, Disc 2, 'Music Inspiration'</ref> The film's look changes drastically from the "realistic" world of the drama to the stylized world of the musical numbers.  For instance, the "I Just Can't Wait to Be King" number transitions from a background of natural savanna to abstract blue and pink African tribal patterns the instant the singing begins — but the scene transitions just as quickly back out of it when the music ends.  Also, in the "Hakuna Matata" number, the characters sing in a jungle surrounding lit by spotlights that follow them from the sky.

The film went on to win Best Original Score and Best Original Song ("[[Can You Feel the Love Tonight]]") in both the [[Academy Awards]] and [[Golden Globe Awards]].<ref name="awards">{{cite web | work=The Internet Movie Database | title= ''The Lion King'' awards|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110357/awards| accessdate=27 August|accessyear=2006}}</ref> Three songs from the film were nominated simultaneously for the [[Academy Award for Best Song|Best Original Song Academy Award]] ("Can You Feel the Love Tonight", "Circle of Life" and "Hakuna Matata"), with "Circle of Life" also being nominated simultaneously in the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song|same category at the Golden Globe Awards]].<ref name="hfpa">{{cite web | work=HFPA| title= Golden Globe Awards|url=http://www1.hfpa.org/browse/film/25384| accessdate=8 November|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

===Songs===
These are the musical numbers of the film, listed in order of appearance.

*'''"[[Circle of Life]]"''' is sung by an off-screen Carmen Twillie, with African vocals by [[Lebo M]] and his African choir. This song is played during the ceremony where a newborn Simba is presented to the animals of the Pride Lands. Not a single line of dialogue is uttered by the characters. The song is reprised at the end of the film, only it is Simba and Nala's newborn cub that is being presented.

*'''"[[I Just Can't Wait to Be King]]"''' is sung by young Simba ([[Jason Weaver]]), young Nala (Laura Williams), and Zazu ([[Rowan Atkinson]]). Simba uses this musical number in the film to distract Zazu (so Nala and he can sneak off to the elephant graveyard), while expressing his wish to be king as soon as possible.

*'''"[[Be Prepared (song)|Be Prepared]]"''' is sung by Scar ([[Jeremy Irons]]/[[Jim Cummings]]), [[Shenzi, Banzai and Ed#Shenzi|Shenzi]] ([[Whoopi Goldberg]]), [[Shenzi, Banzai and Ed#Banzai|Banzai]] ([[Cheech Marin]]) and [[Shenzi, Banzai and Ed#Ed|Ed]] (Jim Cummings). In this song, Scar reveals his evil plot to kill Mufasa and Simba to his loyal hyena minions. The scene where Scar sits on a cliff overlooking his hyenas marching mimics the [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[propaganda]] film ''[[Triumph of the Will]]'', with Scar taking the place of [[Adolf Hitler]]; the hyenas' march is a reminiscent of the Nazi [[Stechschritt|goose-step]]. The voice of Scar in this song switches from Jeremy Irons to Jim Cummings from the line "''You won't get a sniff without me!''" This was reportedly due to Irons's vocal cords giving out.<ref name="beprepared">{{cite web | work=The Internet Movie Database | title=Trivia for The Lion King |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110357/trivia| accessdate=23 August|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

*'''"[[Hakuna Matata (song)|Hakuna Matata]]"''' is sung by [[Timon and Pumbaa|Timon]] ([[Nathan Lane]]), [[Timon and Pumbaa|Pumbaa]] ([[Ernie Sabella]]) and Simba (Jason Weaver as a cub and [[Joseph Williams]] as an adult). Timon and Pumbaa use this song as a warm welcome to Simba as he arrives at their jungle home. Simba learns to eat bugs and grows up into a young adult by the end of the song.

*'''"[[Can You Feel the Love Tonight]]"''' is a love song sung mainly by an off-screen Kristle Edwards, with Timon (Nathan Lane), Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella), adult Simba (Joseph Williams) and adult Nala ([[Sally Dworsky]]). This musical sequence shows Timon and Pumbaa's frustration at Simba falling in love, and the development of Simba and Nala's romantic relationship.

*'''"Morning Report"''' is a song originally not in the film, but was a song written for the film's Broadway musical. It was added to the film, with a whole-new animated sequence, in the 2003 Platinum Edition home video re-release. Sung by [[Zazu]] ([[Jeff Bennett]]), [[Mufasa]] ([[James Earl Jones]]) and young [[Simba]] (Evan Saucedo), the song is an extension of the scene in the original film where Zazu delivers a morning report to Mufasa, and later gets pounced on by Simba.

=== Soundtrack and other albums ===
The film's [[The Lion King (soundtrack)|original motion picture soundtrack]] was released on [[July 13]] [[1994]].

On [[February 28]] [[1995]], Disney released an album entitled ''[[Rhythm of the Pride Lands]]'', a "sequel" to the original soundtrack which featured songs and performances inspired by, but not featured in, the film. Most of the tracks were composed by African composer Lebo M and focused primarily on the African influences of the film's original music, with most songs being sung either partially or entirely in various African languages. Several songs featured in the album would later have incarnations in other Lion King-oriented projects, such as the stage musical or the direct-to-video sequels (examples being "He Lives In You" used as the opening song for ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride''; and a reincarnation of "Warthog Rhapsody", called "That's All I Need", in ''The Lion King 1½''). ''Rhythm of the Pride Lands'' was initially printed in a very limited quantity and therefore has since become a collector's item. However, it was re-released in 2003, included in some international versions of ''The Lion King'''s special edition soundtrack with an additional track.

In 2001, Disney released ''[[Festival of the Lion King (soundtrack)|Festival of The Lion King]]'', a soundtrack of the ''Lion King''-inspired attraction of the same name at [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]].

==Sequels and spin-offs==
The first spin-off was a 70mm film entitled ''[[Circle of Life: An Environmental Fable]]'', which promoted environmental friendliness and shown in the Harvest Theater in [[The Land (Disney)|The Land Pavilion]] at [[Epcot]] in [[Walt Disney World]] in 1995. Also debuted in 1995 was a spin-off television series called ''[[Timon & Pumbaa (TV series)|The Lion King's Timon and Pumbaa]]'' which focused on the titular meerkat and warthog duo. The TV series implied that the story took place during the mid-20th century through the appearance of humans and technology.{{citation-needed}}

Next, a [[direct-to-video]] sequel called ''[[The Lion King II: Simba's Pride]]'' was released in 1998, focusing on Simba's daughter [[Kiara]]. Finally, a direct-to-video [[prequel]]/midquel, ''[[The Lion King 1½]]'' (also known as ''The Lion King 3: Hakuna Matata''), was released in 2004 and takes place in a parallel timeline that interweaves with the original ''Lion King'', but from Timon and Pumbaa's perspective.

==Home video==
''The Lion King'' was first released on [[VHS]] and [[laserdisc]] in the United States on [[March 3]], [[1995]], under Disney's "Masterpiece Collection" video series. The VHS tape quickly became one of the best-selling videotapes of all time: 4.5 million tapes were sold on the first day.<ref name="homevideosellingfigures">{{cite web | work=ComingSoon.Net | title=''The Lion King'' home video selling figures|url=http://comingsoon.net/news.php?id=1818| accessdate=7 June|accessyear=2006}}</ref> In addition, Deluxe Editions of both formats were released. The VHS Deluxe Edition included the film, an exclusive lithograph of Rafiki and Simba (in some editions), a commemorative "Circle of Life" epigraph, six concept art lithographs, another tape with the half-hour TV show ''The Making of The Lion King'', and a certificate of authenticity. The CAV laserdisc Deluxe Edition also contained the film, six concept art lithographs and ''The Making of The Lion King'', but included storyboards, character design artwork, concept art, rough animation, and a directors' commentary that the VHS edition didn't, a total of four double sided disks. These home video versions of ''The Lion King'' all went into [[moratorium (entertainment)|moratorium]] in 1997.<ref name="homevideoinfo">{{cite web | work=Lionking.org | title=TLK on Home Video|url=http://www.lionking.org/homevideo.html| accessdate=24 September|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

On [[October 7]], [[2003]], the film was re-released on VHS and released to DVD for the first time as ''The Lion King: Platinum Edition'', as part of Disney's Platinum Edition line of animated classic DVDs. The DVD release featured a remastered version of the film created for the 2002 [[IMAX]] release, and a second disc with bonus features. The film's soundtrack was available in its original Dolby 5.1 track or in a new Disney Enhanced Home Theater Mix. The DVD was the first of Disney DVDs to include the Disney Enhanced Home Theater Mix.<ref name="DVDfeatures">{{cite web | work=disney.go.com | title=''The Lion King'' Special Edition DVD features|url=http://disneyvideos.disney.go.com/moviefinder/products/3038703.html#details| accessdate=18 September|accessyear=2006}}</ref> By means of [[seamless branching]], the film could be viewed either with or without a newly-created scene — a short conversation in the film replaced with a complete song, "The Morning Report", which was originally written for the [[The Lion King (musical)|stage musical of the film]]. A Special Collector's Gift Set was also released, with the DVD set, five exclusive lithographed character portraits (new sketches created and signed by the original character animators), and an introductory book entitled ''The Journey'' in a black box.<ref name="homevideoinfo">{{cite web | work=Lionking.org | title=TLK on Home Video|url=http://www.lionking.org/homevideo.html| accessdate=24 September|accessyear=2006}}</ref> More than two million copies of the Platinum Edition DVD and VHS units were sold on the first day of release.<ref name="homevideosellingfigures">{{cite web | work=ComingSoon.Net | title=''The Lion King'' home video selling figures|url=http://comingsoon.net/news.php?id=1818| accessdate=7 June|accessyear=2006}}</ref> A DVD boxed set of the three ''Lion King'' films (in two-disc Special Edition formats) was released on [[December 6]], [[2004]].

The Platinum Edition of ''The Lion King'' was criticized by fans mainly for its false advertising — producer [[Don Hahn]] claimed that the film would be in its original 1994 theatrical version earlier, but it ended up being the "digitally enhanced" IMAX version which is slightly different than the original theatrical cut.<ref name="dvddifferences">{{cite web | work=UltimateDisney.com | title=The Lion King: Platinum Edition DVD Review (Page 2) which shows the differences between the film presented on the DVD and the original theatrical cut|url=http://www.ultimatedisney.com/thelionking2.html| accessdate=23 August|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

== Musical ==
{{main|The Lion King (musical)}}

The film was adapted into an award-winning [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[musical theater|stage musical]] with the same title, directed by [[Julie Taymor]], and featured actors in animal costumes as well as giant, hollow [[puppet]]s. After the stage show first opened on [[July 31]], [[1997]] in [[Minneapolis]] at the Orpheum Theatre, it became an instant success; the show went on to be nominated for 11 [[Tony Awards]], winning 6 including Best Musical and Best Director.<ref name="broadway">{{cite web | work= Broadway | title=''The Lion King'' information|url=http://www.broadway.com/gen/show.aspx?SI=1263| accessdate=21 September | accessyear=2006}}</ref> ''[[Festival of the Lion King]]'', an attraction in [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]] and [[Hong Kong Disneyland]], is essentially a shortened version of the musical.

== Controversies ==
===Story origin===
[[Image:Kimbasimba.JPG|thumb|290px|left|Comparison of ''Kimba the White Lion'' and ''The Lion King''. Left: ''Kimba'', right: ''Mufasa''.]]
{{main|Kimba the White Lion#The Lion King controversy}}
''The Lion King'' was claimed to be the first animated Disney film not based on an already-existing story, although the accuracy of this is disputed. ''The Lion King'' bears a striking resemblance to a famous [[Japan|Japanese]] [[anime]] [[television]] show, ''[[Kimba the White Lion]]'', and claims have been made that this was ''The Lion King'' 's inspiration.<ref name="Kimba">{{cite web | work=Kimbawlion.com | title=Comparison screenshots of ''The Lion King'' and ''Kimba the White Lion''|url=http://www.kimbawlion.com/rant2.htm| accessdate=7 June|accessyear=2006}}</ref> Starting with the protagonist's name (Simba/Kimba), most characters in ''Kimba'' have an analogue in ''The Lion King'', and various individual scenes are nearly identical in composition and camera angle.  Most tellingly, however, is an image contained in the Platinum Edition DVD of ''The Lion King'' which clearly shows a ''white'' lion playing with a butterfly.  Disney's official stance is that any resemblance is coincidental, and directors [[Roger Allers]] and [[Rob Minkoff]] claimed that they were well into the development process before the ''Kimba'' similarity was identified. Despite the striking resemblances between the film and the series, the family of [[Osamu Tezuka]], ''Kimba'''s creator, has not filed a suit against Disney for any reason whatsoever.
The filmmakers, however, admitted that the story of ''The Lion King'' was inspired by the 1942 Disney animated film ''[[Bambi]]'', the 1988 Don Bluth film [[The Land Before Time]], ''[[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph the Dreamer]]'', [[Moses]] and ''[[Exodus]]'' from the [[Bible]], and [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]''.<ref name="storyinspiration">{{cite video | people = Don Hahn, Roger Allers, Rob Minkoff | title = The Lion King: Platinum Edition (Disc 2)  | medium = DVD  | publisher = Walt Disney Home Video  | date = 2003}}</ref> [[Christopher Vogler]], in his book ''[[The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure For Writers]]'', described how Disney approached him with a copy of ''Hamlet'' asking how to improve the plot of ''The Lion King'' by incorporating ideas from Shakespeare.<ref>''The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure For Writers'', Vogler, Christopher</ref> Relationships between the two plots include: The brother to the king (Scar to Mufasa; Claudius to King Hamlet) kills the king (this occurs before the play ''Hamlet'' begins). The rightful heir (Simba/Hamlet) does not avenge his father's death at first.  Later, at the urging of his father's ghost, the prince recalls his duty (although Hamlet vacillates between action and inaction unlike Simba) and ultimately returns from exile to kill his uncle (although Hamlet was not in exile at the time, and Simba does not ''personally'' kill Scar). One other possibility is the story of Sumbiata where the antagonist is exiled as the evil half-brother assumes the throne and begins violence until he is recalled to save the kingdom and claim his rightful throne.

In one scene of the film it appears as if animators had embedded the word "sex" into several frames of animation,<ref name="The "SEX" frame">{{cite web | work=Snopes|title=The alleged "SEX" frame in ''The Lion King''|url=http://www.snopes.com/disney/films/lionking.htm| accessdate=1 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref> which conservative activist [[Donald Wildmon]] asserted was a [[subliminal message]] intended to promote [[sexual promiscuity]]. However, several of the films' [[animators]] claim that the letters spell "SFX" (a common abbreviation of "special effects"), and was a sort of innocent "signature" signed by the effects animation team to the work they did.<ref name="sfx">{{cite web | work=Lionking.org FAQ: Hey!

==="The Lion Sleeps Tonight"===
The use of the song "[[The Lion Sleeps Tonight]]" has led to disputes between Disney and the family of [[South Africa]]n [[Solomon Linda]], who composed the song (originally titled "Mbube") in 1939. In July 2004, the family filed suit, seeking $1.6 million in royalties from Disney. In February 2006, Linda's heirs reached a legal settlement with Abilene Music, who held the worldwide rights and had licensed the song to Disney for an undisclosed amount of money.<ref name="undisclosed">{{cite web | work=BBC news |title=Disney settles Lion song dispute|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4721564.stm. | accessdate=31 August | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

[[Image:2f32.jpg|170px|left|thumb|Scene within ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[['Round Springfield]]" referencing the controversy]]
Due to its popularity, ''The Lion King'' was referenced several times in different media. Most notable was the reference to it in the episode of the animated TV series ''[[The Simpsons]]'', "[['Round Springfield]]". Towards the end of the episode, the ghost of Mufasa appears in the clouds with [[Bleeding Gums Murphy]], [[Darth Vader]] and [[James Earl Jones]], saying: "You must avenge my death, Kimba... dah, I mean Simba," a reference to the ''Lion King''/''Kimba the White Lion'' controversy.<ref name="simpsons">{{cite web | work=TV.com | title=A clip from the Simpsons episode 'Round Springfield' which parodied The Lion King|url=http://www.tv.com/media_player/1019/4/viewer.php?context_type=101&context_id=146| accessdate=23 August|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

In the 2002 comedy ''[[Kung Pow: Enter the Fist]]'', an entire scene references ''The Lion King''. While the main protagonist, The Chosen One, is pondering newly received information about his enemies and deceased family, a Mufasa-look-alike called "Mu-Shu Fasa" appears in the clouds. "Mu-Shu Fasa" even calls The Chosen One "Simba" before calling him "Chosimba".<ref name="kungpow">{{cite web | work=The Internet Movie Database | title=''Kung Pow: Enter the Fist'' trivia|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0240468/trivia| accessdate=24 August|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

One of its Oscar-nominated songs was also referenced in an episode of the 2005–2006 series of the British science fiction TV serial ''[[Doctor Who]]'', "[[The Christmas Invasion]]". In the episode, the [[Tenth Doctor]] ([[David Tennant]]) quotes the first few lines of the song "[[Circle of Life]]" when trying to persuade the [[List of Doctor Who monsters and aliens#Sycorax|Sycorax]] leader to spare humanity. [[Julie Gardner]], the executive producer of ''Doctor Who'', mentions in the audio commentary for this episode that the "''Lion King'' speech" is one of her favorite parts of the episode.<ref name="Doctor Who">{{cite web | work=BBC | title=Audio commentaries for 2005-2006 Doctor Who episodes| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/sounds/ | accessdate=27 July|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

In a [[2006]] episode of the US TV series ''[[The Office (US TV series)|The Office]]'' titled ''Grief Counseling'', [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]] tells the tale of "his cousin Mufasa" who was trampled by wildebeests, in an effort to satisfy his boss, [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]], who insists the staff work through their "grief" over the death of a company man they never knew.<ref name="The Office">{{cite web | work=The Internet Movie Database | title=Quotes from ''The Office'' episode ''Grief Counseling'' | url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0877241/quotes | accessdate=19 November|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

Disney has also referenced ''The Lion King'' in its own films. In the Disney-released, Pixar-produced 1995 computer animated film ''[[Toy Story]]'', the song "[[Hakuna Matata]]" can be heard playing in [[List of Toy Story characters#Andy Davis|Andy's]] car during the film's climax.<ref name="toystory">{{cite web | work=The Internet Movie Database | title=''Toy Story'' trivia|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/trivia| accessdate=27 August|accessyear=2006}}</ref> Also in 1995, the live-action ''[[Man of the House (1995 film)]]'' had a scene in which Jonathan Taylor Thomas (who voiced young Simba) reads a ''Lion King'' [[comic book]].<ref name="manofthehouse">{{cite web | work=Disney Animation Kingdom - Jokes | title=''Man of the House'' in-jokes|url=http://disney.wretch.cc/Joke/moth.htm| accessdate=27 August|accessyear=2006}}</ref> Pumbaa made brief appearances in ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''<ref name="hunchback">{{cite web | work=The Internet Movie Database | title=''The Hunchback of Notre Dame'' trivia|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116583/trivia| accessdate=27 August|accessyear=2006}}</ref> and ''[[Aladdin and the King of Thieves]]'',<ref name="aladdin3">{{cite web | work=Disney Animation Kingdom - Jokes | title=''Aladdin and the King of Thieves'' in-jokes|url=http://disney.wretch.cc/Joke/aatkot.htm| accessdate=27 August|accessyear=2006}}</ref> both released in 1996. The 1997 animated film ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]]'' paid homage to both ''The Lion King'' and the [[Nemean Lion]], where Scar's skin is worn by Hercules while he is posing for a painting on a [[Greece|Greek]] vase<ref name="hercules">{{cite web | work=Disney Animation Kingdom - Jokes | title=''Hercules'' in-jokes|url=http://disney.wretch.cc/Joke/c35.htm| accessdate=27 August|accessyear=2006}}</ref> (not by coincidence, [[Andreas Deja]] was the supervising animator of both Scar and Hercules). Another 1997 film, ''[[George of the Jungle (film)|George of the Jungle]]'', referenced the scene where Simba is presented at Pride Rock.<ref name="george">{{cite web | work=Disney Animation Kingdom - Jokes | title=''George of the Jungle'' in-jokes|url=http://disney.wretch.cc/Joke/george.htm| accessdate=27 August|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

In the TV Series "[[Home Improvement]]", while [[Tim Allen]] is entertaining his on-screen niece with stuffed animals, he incorrectly refers to a doll as a [[Simba]] doll. His niece corrects that the doll is 'Mr. Lion Cub', to which Tim replies "Sorry, I've never been a lion cub before!" Jonathan Taylor Thomas then enters the shot and says "I have. You know, I gotta tell you it's a tough gig. Everyone expects you to be king..." {{citation-needed}}

==Video games==
Two video games based on the film have been released. The first, simply called ''[[The Lion King (video game)|The Lion King]]'', was published in 1994 by [[Virgin Group|Virgin]] and was released on [[NES]], [[SNES]], [[Game Boy]], [[Sega Master System]], [[Sega Mega Drive|Sega Genesis]], [[Game Gear]], [[Personal computer|PC]] and [[Amiga]]. The second, entitled ''The Lion King: Simba's Mighty Adventure'', was published in 2000 by Activision and was released on [[PlayStation]] and [[Game Boy Color]]. 

A third game was published in 2004 simply called "The Lion King" for [[Game Boy Advance]] in Europe and Asia, but was in fact a game based on the direct-to-video prequel/midquel ''[[The Lion King 1½]]'' with Timon and Pumbaa as the playable characters.  Unlike its counterparts, the U.S. version clearly shows the title ''The Lion King 1½'' on the box.

Simba can also be found in every game in the [[Kingdom Hearts series|''Kingdom Hearts'' series]], while the Pride Lands can be explored in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]''.
