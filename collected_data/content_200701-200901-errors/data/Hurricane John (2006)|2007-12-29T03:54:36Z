'''Hurricane John''' was the eleventh [[tropical cyclone|named storm]], seventh hurricane, and fifth major hurricane of the [[2006 Pacific hurricane season]]. The hurricane threatened large portions of [[Mexico]]'s western coastline, resulting in the evacuation of tens of thousands of people. Hurricane John developed on [[August 28]] from a [[tropical wave]] to the south of [[Mexico]]. Favorable conditions allowed the storm to quickly intensify, and John attained peak winds of 135&nbsp;mph (215&nbsp;km/h) on [[August 30]]. [[Eye (cyclone)|Eyewall]] replacement cycles and land interaction with western Mexico weakened the hurricane, and John made landfall on southeastern [[Baja California]] with winds of 110&nbsp;mph (180&nbsp;km/h) on [[September 1]]. It slowly weakened as it moved northwestward through Baja California, and dissipated on [[September 4]]. Moisture from the remnants of the storm entered the southwest [[United States]].

In coastal portions of western Mexico, strong winds downed trees, while heavy rain resulted in mudslides. Hurricane John caused moderate damage on [[Baja California]], including destroying 4 houses and thousands of flimsy shacks. The hurricane killed six people in Mexico. In the southwest United States, moisture from the remnants of John produced heavy rainfall. The rainfall aided drought conditions in portions of northern [[Texas]], though it was detrimental in locations that had received above-normal rainfall throughout the year.

The [[tropical wave]] that would become John moved off the coast of [[Africa]] on [[August 17]]. It entered the eastern [[Pacific Ocean]] on [[August 24]], and quickly showed signs of organization.

The Mexican army and emergency services were stationed near the coast, while public schools in and around Acapulco were cancelled. Officials in Acapulco advised low-lying residents to be on alert, and also urged boats to return to harbor. Authorities in the twin resort cities of [[Ixtapa]] and [[Zihuatanejo]] closed the port to small ocean craft.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20060830/ai_n16697513 | title=Hurricane John grows to a Category 4 storm along Mexico's Pacific coast | date=[[2006-08-30]] | accessdate=2007-01-20 | author=[[Associated Press]] | publisher=Deseret News}}</ref> Government officials in the state of [[Jalisco]] declared a mandatory evacuation for 8,000&nbsp;citizens in low-lying areas to 900 temporary shelters.

On [[August 31]], the [[Baja California Sur]] state government ordered the evacuation of over 10,000&nbsp;residents. Those who refused to follow the evacuation order would have been forced to evacuate by the army. Shelters were set up to allow local residents and tourists to ride out the storm.
