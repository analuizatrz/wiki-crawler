''Cillian'' is an Irish name which is [[anglicised]] ''Killian''; both spellings are [[IPA chart for English|pronounced]] "Killyann" (though the former spelling is often mispronounced "Sillian").<ref name="LA Times story">[http://www.calendarlive.com/printedition/calendar/suncal/cl-ca-cillian11mar11,0,285449.story?coll=cl-suncal Cillian Murphy: more to offer than pale blue eyes] ''The Los Angeles Times'', 11 March 2007</ref> In [[Irish Language|Irish]], his name is Cillian Ó Murchú, but he has never used that professionally.<ref name="Cillian Murphy IMDb Page">[http://imdb.com/name/nm0614165/ Cillian Murphy - Filmography] IMDb</ref> A resident of [[London]] since 2001,<ref name="Blag">[http://www.cilliansite.com/press/feature-stories/2006-07-00-blag Cillian Murphy] ''Blag'' (on The CillianSite)</ref> Murphy often (though not always) works in or near London<ref name="Cillian Murphy IMDb Page">[http://imdb.com/name/nm0614165/ Cillian Murphy - Filmography] IMDb</ref> and has no desire to move to [[Hollywood]].<ref name="Flair">[http://www.cilliansite.com/press/feature-stories/2007-06-00-flair Murphy's Law] ''Flair'' (on The CillianSite)</ref>

==Early life==
Murphy was born in [[Douglas, Cork]] in [[Ireland]] and attended the [[Presentation Brothers College, Cork]]. Originally, he was most interested in performing as a [[rock musician]]. He played guitar and sang with a [[Frank Zappa]] influenced band called The Sons of Mr. Greengenes. In 1996, the band was offered a record deal, but they didn't sign, partially because Murphy's brother Páidi, who also played in the band, was still in secondary school and their parents didn't approve, but also because the contract was to pay very little and would have given the rights to Murphy's compositions to the record label.<ref name="From Cork to Gotham">[http://www.cilliansite.com/press/feature-stories/2004-02-08-sundayindie From Cork to Gotham] ''Sunday Independent Life'', 8 February 2004 (on The CillianSite)</ref>

That same year, Murphy started studying [[law]] at [[University College Cork]] (UCC), but flunked out only a year later.<ref name="From Cork to Gotham">[http://www.cilliansite.com/press/feature-stories/2004-02-08-sundayindie From Cork to Gotham] ''Sunday Independent Life'', 8 February 2004 (on The CillianSite)</ref> After seeing a stage production of ''[[A Clockwork Orange]]'', his interest had begun to shift to acting. <ref name="More to offer than pale blue eyes">[http://www.cilliansite.com/press/feature-stories/2007-03-08-latimes Cillian Murphy: More to offer than pale blue eyes] ''The Los Angeles Times'', 8 March 2007 (on The CillianSite)</ref>

His first major role was in the UCC Drama Society production of ''[[Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme]]''. In September 1996, he originated the role of Pig on the professional stage in [[Cork (city)|Cork]], in [[Enda Walsh]]'s ''[[Disco Pigs]]'', directed by [[Pat Kiernan]].<ref name="Disco Pigs play info">[http://www.cilliansite.com/body-of-work/plays/disco-pigs Disco Pigs, original stage production] The CillianSite's Body of Work section</ref> ''Disco Pigs'' ended up touring throughout [[Europe]] and in [[Canada]] for over two years, launching Murphy's acting career.

==Career==
[[Image:Cillian1.jpg|110px|right|thumb|Cillian Murphy as Jim from ''[[28 Days Later]]''.]]The play ''Disco Pigs'' was Murphy's first big break, and he later reprised that role for the [[2001 in film|2001]] independent film version by [[Kirsten Sheridan]]. The closing credits for ''[[Disco Pigs]]'' feature Murphy performing his original song "So New". 

From 1997 to 2002, Murphy starred in feature films, [[Short film|shorts]], plays and in the BBC mini-series adaptation of ''[[The Way We Live Now]]'', but it was not until [[Danny Boyle]]'s ''[[28 Days Later]]'' became a [[sleeper hit]] in the [[United States of America|USA]] in [[2003 in film|2003]], that the major movie studios and directors started to take notice. As for the actor's full-frontal nudity in the film, Murphy claimed he was perfectly comfortable doing nudity if the role called for it.

In [[2003 in film|2003]], he starred alongside [[Colin Farrell]] in the Irish [[Independent film|indie]] ''[[Intermission (film)|Intermission]]'' and had supporting roles in his first Hollywood films, ''[[Cold Mountain (film)|Cold Mountain]]'' and ''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring (film)|Girl with a Pearl Earring]]''. For the latter film, he learned to chop up meat in an abattoir for his role as a butcher, even though he is a vegetarian.<ref name="Irish Tatler">[http://www.cilliansite.com/press/feature-stories/2004-02-00-irishtat The Butcher Boy] ''Irish Tatler'', February 2004 (on The CillianSite)</ref> 2004 found him touring Ireland in the titular role in the classic Irish play, ''[[The Playboy of the Western World]]'', as well as filming two of his biggest movie roles to date.

[[2005 in film|2005]] was the year that saw Murphy winning wider recognition with his performance as Dr. Jonathan Crane/[[supervillain]] [[Scarecrow (comics)|The Scarecrow]] in ''[[Batman Begins]]'' and his role as bad guy Jackson Rippner in ''[[Red Eye (film)|Red Eye]]''. Murphy received a nomination for the Best Villain honor at the  [[MTV Movie Awards 2006|2006 MTV Movie Awards]] for his performance in ''Batman Begins'', but lost to [[Hayden Christensen]] for ''[[Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith]]''. 

[[Image:RedEye05.jpg|left|thumb|Cillian as Jackson Rippner in ''[[Red Eye (film)|Red Eye]]'' with [[Rachel McAdams]]]]

He originally auditioned for the role of [[Batman]] (Bruce Wayne) in ''Batman Begins''. Though the part was eventually given to [[Christian Bale]], director [[Christopher Nolan]] was reportedly very impressed with Murphy's audition and persuaded him to take the role of Dr. Jonathan Crane, whose alter ego is the villain [[Scarecrow (comics)|Scarecrow]]. It is not known if the character of Crane/Scarecrow will appear in the currently filming sequel, ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'', though Murphy has stated that he would be glad to reprise the character if asked. Recently, the [[fansite]] Batman-on-film.com reported that an anonymous insider says Murphy will return as Scarecrow in ''The Dark Knight'', but this is an unconfirmed rumor.

According to ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' magazine, he was #3 of "The Most Valuable Players of Summer 2005", a list for entertainers who have outstanding breakthrough performances for the year 2005. He was placed behind [[Terrence Howard]] and [[Matt Dillon]]. The magazine went on to compare him with [[Robert Mitchum]].

In late 2005, he starred as a transgendered orphan in search of his mother in [[Neil Jordan]]'s ''[[Breakfast on Pluto (film)|Breakfast on Pluto]]'', based on the novel of the same title by [[Patrick McCabe]]. He was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Actor in Musical or Comedy for this movie ([[Joaquin Phoenix]] won for ''[[Walk the Line]]''), but won the [[IFTA Award]]<ref name="IFTA news">[http://entertainment.uk.msn.com/news/Article.aspx?cp-documentid=2907063 Eva and Cillian take film accolades] U.K. MSN Entertainment News, 11 February 2007</ref>.

In [[2006 in film|2006]] / [[2007 in film|2007]], he starred in [[Ken Loach]]'s film about the [[Irish War of Independence]] and [[Irish Civil War|Civil War]], ''[[The Wind That Shakes the Barley (film)|The Wind That Shakes the Barley]]'', another movie in which his performance was highly praised. The film won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]], and replaced ''[[Intermission (film)|Intermission]]'' as the most successful independent film in Irish history.

Murphy returned to the stage from November 2006 to February 2007 to play the lead role in [[John Kolvenbach]]'s play ''Love Song'', opposite [[Neve Campbell]], in London's West End. In [[2007 in film|2007]], he stars as a physicist-astronaut charged with re-igniting the sun in the [[sci-fi]] movie ''[[Sunshine (2007 film)|Sunshine]]'', which re-teams him with director [[Danny Boyle]], and as a cinephile in [[Paul Soter]]'s forth-coming romantic comedy, ''[[Watching the Detectives]]'', opposite [[Lucy Liu]].

Murphy is now filming ''[[The Edge of Love]]'' with [[Keira Knightley]], [[Sienna Miller]] and [[Matthew Rhys]] in Wales and London. Just cast in the newly announced ''[[Hippie Hippie Shake]]'' (again alongside Sienna Miller), Murphy will star as [[Richard Neville]],<ref name="Hippie Hippie Shake announced">[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i0c726bd1e68cd8aaeb602a2cf542e38c Four tune in, turn on, drop] ''Hollywood Reporter'', 3 May 2007</ref> the editor of the psychedelic, radical underground magazine ''[[Oz (magazine)|Oz]]'', which was at the center of what was then the longest obscenity trial in British history. Shooting starts in the fall.

The couple live in [[London]], [[England]], with their son Malachy  (b. December 4, 2005).
