==History==
Just prior to the City of Upland's growth spurt in the 1960's, [[Upland High School]] was established in 1955. By the 1980s this population growth had the side-effect of overcrowding, which in turn caused students to transfer to other high schools in the [[Chaffey Joint Union High School District]]. The affected families then began a movement towards unifying the existing elementary and middle schools into a separate district. Superintendent George Renworth promoted this movement and the Upland Unified School District was established in 1986. Upland High School has been a part of the district since it left the Chaffey Joint Union High School District in 1991.<ref name="uhsd-history">Upland High School District: "Transforming Lives"</ref>
