'''Hayley Dee Westenra''' (born [[10 April]] [[1987]] in [[Christchurch]])<ref name="autobio">{{cite book |title=Hayley Westenra: In Her Own Voice |first= Hayley |last=Westenra |publisher=Virgin Books Ltd |location=London |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-905264-20-9}}</ref><ref name="ccl1">{{cite web |url=http://library.christchurch.org.nz/Music/Profiles/HayleyWestenra/ |title=Hayley Westenra |work=Christchurch City Libraries |accessdate=2007-08-26}}</ref> is a [[New Zealand]] [[soprano]] of [[Ireland|Irish]] heritage. Her first internationally released album, ''[[Pure (Hayley Westenra album)|Pure]]'', reached #1 on the [[United Kingdom|UK]] classical charts in 2003 and has sold more than two million copies worldwide. Westenra has received awards for her contribution to music, both in New Zealand and worldwide.

''[[Pure (Hayley Westenra album)|Pure]]'' is the fastest-selling international début classical album to date, and Westenra became an international star, aged 16,  when the first of her international albums were released. In August 2006, Westenra joined the Irish group [[Celtic Woman]] and toured with them on their 2007 Spring Tour.

Westenra has performed for dignitaries around the world. She is the youngest [[UNICEF]] Ambassador to date and has been lauded for her charitable contributions to the world.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Westenra's parents, Jill and Gerald Westenra, have two other children, Sophie and Isaac. The family has a history of music: Westenra's grandmother Shirley Ireland was a singer, and her grandfather was a pianist who also played the [[piano accordion]].<ref name="DVDLIVE1">{{cite video |title=Hayley Westenra: Live from New Zealand |medium=DVD |year=2005 |publisher=Universal Music}}</ref>

Her pursuit of a musical career began at the age of six, when she was cast in the lead singing role of "Little Star" in the [[Christmas]] play<ref name="DVDLIVE1"/> at her school, Cobham Intermediate.<ref name="wing_named">{{cite news |url=http://www.classicalx.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=895 |title=Cobham music wing named for Hayley |work=The Press NZ |date=[[2007-04-24]] |accessdate=2007-08-26}}</ref> After the show, a teacher who had watched the performance approached her parents to tell them that their daughter was pitch perfect.<ref name="DVDLIVE1" /> The teacher encouraged Westenra to learn how to play a musical instrument to improve her abilities, and she duly learned to read music and play the [[violin]], [[piano]], and [[recorder]]. She began voice lessons and discovered a passion for musical theatre. By age 11, she had performed more than 40 times on stage<ref name=DVDLIVE1/> but was often given male parts: "I got boy parts quite often. In ballet, there were not enough boys. So they ended up choosing half and half. I got chosen to wear the grey suit and the wig, and not the pretty dresses. In ''[[A Christmas Carol]],'' I was Tiny Tim, so I got to be quite a sick, sick boy. There was a severe lack of singing boys and, at the time, it was quite disappointing."<ref name=cbs_online_article_1>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/03/03/entertainment/main1367468.shtml |title=Hayley Westenra: Teen Angel |work=CBSNews.com |first=Ellen |last=Crean |date=[[2006-03-03]] |accessdate=2007-01-11}}</ref>

At the age of 12, Westenra entered a professional recording studio to record ''[[Walking in the Air (album)|Walking in the Air]]'', a demo album originally created for friends and family; only about 1000 copies were made. Some time later, after finishing her album, both Westenra and her sister, Sophie, [[busking|busked]] in Christchurch. The pair drew a large crowd, and one woman asked the girls if they had ever recorded anything. The woman turned out to be a journalist with [[Canterbury Television]], and she asked Westenra to appear on air.<ref name="sexton_article">{{cite news |url=http://www.hayley-westenra-international.com/dhtml-pages/html-2004/news/20040327_Hayley%20Westenra%20-%20Kiwi%20Star%20Impresses%20The%20World.htm |title=Hayley Westenra: Kiwi Star Impresses the World |work=Billboard '''15''' (3) |first=Paul |last=Sexton |format=Reprint |coauthors=Christie Eliezer, Anastasia Tsioulcas |date=[[2004-03-27]] |accessdate=2006-12-13}}</ref>

A concert promotion company, under the direction of Gray Bartlett, watched the show and became interested in working with Westenra.<ref name="sexton_article" /> Shortly after this, she was offered a recording deal with Universal New Zealand before  she met any representatives of the company.<ref name="boston_globe_article_1">{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2004/07/04/at_17_new_zealand_soprano_has_a_voice_to_be_reckoned_with/ |title=At 17, New Zealand soprano has a voice to be reckoned with |work=The Boston Globe |first=Joan |last=Anderman |date=[[2004-07-04]] |accessdate=2007-03-02}}</ref>  On this label, Westenra released a self-titled album of show tunes and light classical songs, as well as ''[[My Gift to You]]'', a CD of Christmas music. Following the success of her albums, she was offered and later received lessons from Dame [[Malvina Major]].<ref name="DVDLIVE1" />

===International success===
Although her albums were quite successful in New Zealand, Westenra was unknown worldwide until she landed a contract with [[Decca Records]] and recorded ''[[Pure (Hayley Westenra album)|Pure]]'', a CD of classical, light pop, and traditional [[Māori]] songs. Decca's UK president was also impressed with her voice when they signed her to the label, saying that she was "captivated by the beauty and expressiveness of her voice."<ref name="McNickel_article">{{cite news |title=Teen-age Classics |work=Billboard '''41''' (1) |first=David |last=McNickel |date=[[2002-02-16]] |accessdate=2006-12-13}}</ref> ''Pure'' enjoyed record success: it became the fastest-selling international debut album in the history of the [[UK classical chart]]s, sold 19,068 copies in its first week alone, quickly reached #1 on the UK chart, and entered the [[UK Albums Chart|UK Pop Chart]] at #8.<ref name="sexton_article" /><ref name=BBCinfo>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/shropshire/content/articles/2005/11/28/hayley_westenra_abbey_preview_feature.shtml |title=Hayley Westenra returns to Abbey... |work=BBC Entertainment |accessdate=2007-08-11}}</ref> To date, over two million copies of ''Pure'' have been sold. In New Zealand, ''Pure'' has been certified 10x platinum, making her the best-selling artist, regardless of genre, in the country's history.<ref name="performingarts1">{{cite press release |url=http://www.performingarts.ufl.edu/programs/Hayley%20Westenra.pdf |title=Teenage songstress Hayley Westenra brings gorgeous classical crossover music to the Phillips Center |publisher=University of Florida Performing Arts |format=PDF |date=[[2006-03-03]] |accessdate=2006-03-22}}</ref> 

''Pure'''s success ensured that Decca would take Westenra seriously. Some of her fame today can be directly attributed to the way in which Decca promoted her. Although the traditional audience of classical crossover music is that of adult women, they also promoted her music to children and teenagers.<ref name="hailing_distance_of_us">{{cite news |url=http://www.hayley-westenra-international.com/dhtml-pages/html-2004/news/20040327_Hayley%20Westenra%20-%20In%20Hailing%20Distance%20Of%20US%20Debut.htm |title=In Hailing Distance Of U.S. Debut |format=Reprint |work=Billboard '''15''' (2) |first=Anastasia |last=Tsioulcas |date=[[2004-03-27]] |accessdate=2006-12-13}}</ref> Westenra recorded the end-title song for [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s movie ''[[Mulan II]]''.<ref name="mulan2">{{cite video |title=Mulan II |people=Rooney, Darrell (Director) and Lynne Southerland |publisher=The Walt Disney Company |year=2004}}</ref> They also featured her in the national [[Radio Disney]] music education tour for middle-school students. David Horn, the producer of her live TV special which aired on [[PBS]]' [[Great Performances]], said, "Her singing is so gorgeous, it's reminiscent of the great boy-soprano sound of Anglican church choirs."<ref name="hailing_distance_of_us" /> This special was entitled, ''Hayley Westenra: Live from New Zealand''.<ref name="DVDLIVE1" /><ref name="pbs1">{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/gperf/shows/westenra/ |title=Hayley Westenra: Live from New Zealand |work=PBS |accessdate=2006-12-13}}</ref>

[[Image:Hayleyamericandreams.jpg|left|thumb|Westenra on ''[[American Dreams]]'']]

Decca has also promoted Westenra on television. She took her first acting role on the [[United States|US]] programme ''[[American Dreams]]'' ("Charade"), where she played [[guitar]] and sang "Who Painted the Moon Black?".<ref name="americandreams1">{{cite episode |title=Charade |series=American Dreams |serieslink=American Dreams |airdate=2004-10-03 |season=2 |episode=46 |network=[[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]]}}</ref> While she was being promoted in [[Los Angeles, California]], Marc Johnston, senior VP/GM for the Universal Classics Group, said, "When she was out there, people were giving her scripts to read, and she had a few rather impromptu auditions. So some film and TV roles are currently in the works."<ref name="hailing_distance_of_us" /> In 2005, she was featured in the song "Bridal Ballad" recorded for the movie ''[[The Merchant of Venice (2004 film)|The Merchant of Venice]]''.<ref name="merchant">{{cite video |title=The Merchant of Venice |publisher=Sony Pictures Entertainment |year=2004 |people=Radford, Michael (Director)}}</ref> In 2006, she was featured on the motion picture soundtrack for ''[[The New World]]'' for the song "Listen to the Wind".

Westenra was the 2004 Vodafone [[New Zealand Music Awards]] winner of "Highest Selling New Zealand Album" and "International Achievement Award"<ref name="vodafone1">{{cite web |url=http://www.nzmusicawards.co.nz/awards2006/history2004.html |title=Winners 2004 |work=NZMusicAwards.co.nz |accessdate=2007-04-15}} </ref> On [[20 February]] [[2004]], Prime Minister [[Helen Clark]] awarded her for being the first New Zealand artist to receive the tenfold platinum status in the New Zealand market, where she held the number one artist position for 18 weeks.<ref name="sexton_article" /> She has won two Japanese Grammies for her work (Song of the Year, "[[Amazing Grace]]" and Album of the Year, ''Pure''). Also in 2004, she began her world tour of [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], [[Japan]], and the [[United Kingdom|UK]], performing in a concert in November for [[Majesty|Her Majesty]] The Queen, Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], [[Prince Charles]], [[Colin Powell]], [[Condoleezza Rice]] and President [[George W. Bush]].<ref name="the_hayley_show_article">{{cite news |title=Can't Stop the Music |work=Women's Wear Daily |first=Nandini |last=D'Souza |coauthors=Venessa Lau |date=[[2004-04-29]] |accessdate=2006-12-13}}</ref>. At the [[Sydney Opera House]] she received a rare [[standing ovation]]. She concluded 2004 with a successful Christmas tour of the east coast of the [[United States]] as guest soloist with the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]].<ref name="officialsite_bio">{{cite web |url=http://www.hayleywestenra.com/hayley-westenra-biography.htm |title=Biography |work=HayleyWestenra.com |accessdate=2006-12-13}}</ref>

[[Image:HayleyWestenraWikipedia2.jpg|right|thumb|Westenra in concert]]

In 2005, she released a new album called ''Odyssey''. A mix of classical, pop, Celtic, and new age music, she co-wrote and arranged some of the tracks on the album, which was released in the United States on [[18 October]] [[2005]]. A more recent version of ''Odyssey'' containing several recordings not on the original album was released in the United Kingdom on [[10 April]] [[2006]], her 19th birthday. To conclude 2005, she made an appearance on [[Kurt Browning]]'s programme ''Gotta Skate'', which aired on [[18 December]], in which she performed with [[Andrea Bocelli]].<ref name="skate1">{{cite video |title=Kurt Browning's Gotta Skate 2005 |publisher=[[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]] |medium=Television production |date=December 18 |year=2005}}</ref>

Westenra spent the first half of 2006 performing as a supporting act for the pop-opera quartet [[Il Divo]] on a worldwide tour, though in March she performed solo concerts in the U.S. as well. That tour officially ended in June, but was then extended by six performances.  She then held several concerts in the [[UK]] and [[Germany]] through the end of the northern summer.<ref name="officialwebsite_news">{{cite web |url=http://www.hayleywestenra.com/hayley-westenra-news.htm |title=News |work=HayleyWestenra.com |accessdate=2006-04-13}}</ref> On [[5 September]] [[2006]], Westenra was named as one of the ten outstanding young people in the world by the [[Junior Chamber International]]. On [[13 November]] [[2006]] she participated in the dedication of the New Zealand War Memorial in London.<ref name="NZedge">{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/search/story.cfm?storyid=00046269-312D-1556-AD7E83027AF1010F |title=Queen, Blair, Clark at opening of NZ memorial |work=New Zealand Herald |first=Andy |last=Macdonald |date=[[2006-11-12]] |accessdate=2007-04-15}}</ref> Three of Westenra's great-uncles served in [[World War II]], one was killed.<ref name="wing_named" />

After releasing ''Pure'', Westenra and her family moved to [[London]]. She continues to live in a central London flat, even though her family subsequently returned home to Christchurch. Although she spent most of 2006 touring, she did visit them when her schedule allowed.<ref name="march_06_newsletter">{{cite web |url=http://www.hayleywestenra.com/newsletter/march_2006.html |title=March 2006 Newsletter |work=HayleyWestenra.com |accessdate=2006-04-13}}</ref>

===Beyond her initial success===

In August 2006, Westenra joined [[Celtic Woman]]<ref name="CW211">{{cite web |url=http://www.celticwoman.com/viewSection.asp?idSection=211 |title=September 06 |work=CelticWoman.com |accessdate=2007-02-13}}</ref> and is featured on their second major DVD/CD album, ''[[Celtic Woman: A New Journey]]'', which was released [[30 January]] [[2007]] and immediately hit the Billboard Top 200 music chart at #4.<ref name="celtic_new_journey_billboard">{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/chart_display.jsp?g=Albums&f=The+Billboard+200 |title=The Billboard 200 |work=Billboard |accessdate=2007-02-15}}</ref> She toured with the group in the United States in 2007, with scheduled appearances in 88 venues across the country; the tour ended in June of the same year.<ref name="celticwoman187">{{cite web |url=http://www.celticwoman.com/viewSection.asp?idSection=187&id=tour |title=US Tour Dates |work=CelticWoman.com |accessdate=2007-04-15}}</ref><ref name="celticwomantourend">{{cite web |url=http://www.celticwoman.com/viewSection.asp?idSection=203 |title=News |work=CelticWoman.com |accessdate=2007-08-11}}</ref>

Westenra's third international album, ''Treasure'', was released on [[26 February]] [[2007]] in the UK. All the songs on this CD were chosen by Westenra, who gave her record company "no say in the matter. I basically didn't let them in on what I was recording until the last minute so they had no choice. I didn't give them much room to disagree."<ref name="info_on_treasure_Herald">"Hayley Westenra in charge of her career", The New Zealand Herald, [[2007-04-28]]. Lexis Nexis. Susquehanna University. [[25 May]]. [[2007]].</ref> Tracks on this album include "E Pari Ra", "One Fine Day", "Let Me Lie", "[[Danny Boy]]", and "[[Abide With Me]]". Westenra co-wrote four of the fifteen tracks, and the album also features singer [[Humphrey Berney]]. The US/Australia/NZ edition followed in March under the name ''Celtic Treasure''. Westenra dedicated the album to her grandmother, Shirley Ireland. Inside the sleeve of the UK edition, she wrote "I come from a musical family, and one with a real sense of history. My forefathers were on the maiden voyage from [[Ireland]] to Christchurch, New Zealand in 1850 – there's even a commemoration plaque in Cathedral Square, Christchurch, which bears the name Westenra. My grandmother used to sit me on her knee and sing songs like ''Danny Boy'' from as early as I can remember. A singer herself in her earlier years, she has always been a never-ending source of songs. It's this legacy of music that she's been passing down to me since my childhood, and it's many of these beautiful old songs that I've explored here on my album."

As her success increased so did her political activism. On St. Patrick's Day 2007, she performed again for President George W. Bush at the White House.<ref name="ucj_article">"UCJ to target Aussies and Kiwis for latest Hayley Westenra album." Music Week ([[March 17]], [[2007]]): 20. InfoTrac OneFile. Thomson Gale.

Westenra starred as Maria in the 2007 recording of [[West Side Story]], which was released on [[30 July]].<ref name="petition" /> On [[28 July]], she starred in Woburn LIVE 2007, where she performed a selection of the music of West Side Story with the other recording artists from the 2007 release.<ref name="woburn2007">{{cite web |url=http://www.woburnlive.com/Woburn-flash.html |work=Woburn |title=Woburn LIVE 2007 |accessdate=2007-06-06}}</ref>

Westenra is known as a [[vegetarian]]/[[Pescetarianism|pescotarian]], and is currently nominated for [[PETA]]'s 'Sexiest Vegetarian' for 2007.<ref name="richard_ref"> {{cite web |url=http://www.richardogdenmanagement.com/pages/richard_biog.htm |title=RICHARD OGDEN BIOGRAPHY|accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref><ref name="HWI_2004_brit_awards">{{cite web |url=http://www.hayley-westenra-international.com/dhtml-pages/html-2004/reviews/20040528_ClassicalBritAwardsRM.htm |title=The 2004 Classical Brit Awards|accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref><ref name="listener">

She is sometimes unable to obtain the vegetarian sources she prefers, and on those occasions she eats meat to fulfil her nutritional requirements. Westenra told the New Zealand Herald, "I'm completely bursting the bubble now, aren't I? That's that ruined."<ref name="nzheronlinepg2">{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1501119/story.cfm?c_id=1501119&objectid=10436564&pnum=0 |title=Hayley Westenra – 'I'm a tough chick' |work=New Zealand Herald |accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref>

Westenra is the youngest [[UNICEF]] Ambassador to date.
