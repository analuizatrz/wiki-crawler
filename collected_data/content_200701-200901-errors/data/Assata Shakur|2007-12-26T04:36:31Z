==Early life==
Shakur was born in New York City on [[July 16]], [[1947]], or, according to the FBI, [[August 19]], [[1952]], but spent most of her childhood in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]]<ref name="scheffler203">Scheffler, p. 203.</ref> until her family relocated to [[Queens]] when she was a teenager. She attended [[Borough of Manhattan Community College]] and [[City College of New York]] in the mid 1960s, where she was involved in many political activities. After graduation, Shakur became involved in the [[Black Panther Party]] and the [[Black Liberation Army]].<ref name="james">James, Matthew Thomas. Joy James (Ed.). 2005.

Msgr. John Powis alleged that Shakur was involved in an armed robbery at his Our Lady of the Presentation church in [[Brownsville, Brooklyn]] on [[September 14]], [[1972]] based on [[FBI]] photographs; Shakur was not charged with this robbery and the only person arrested for it was acquitted.<ref name="Daily News Article"> Daly, Michael. 2006, December 13.

In 1972, Shakur was made the subject of a nationwide manhunt after the F.B.I. alleged that she was the "revolutionary mother hen" of a Black Liberation Army cell which had conducted a "series of cold-blooded murders of [[New York City Police Department|New York City police officers]]."<ref name="churchill308"/> After her capture, however, Shakur was charged with none of the killings which had made her the subject of the manhunt.<ref name="churchill308"/>

==New Jersey Turnpike shootout==
[[Image:assatamugshot.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mugshot]] of Shakur, taken on May 2, 1973]]
On [[May 2]], [[1973]], just after midnight,<ref name="kirsta"/> Shakur, at that time a member of the [[Black Liberation Army]] and no longer a member of the Black Panther Party, along with Zayd Malik Shakur (born James F Coston) and [[Sundiata Acoli]] (born Clark Squire), was stopped on the [[New Jersey Turnpike]] in [[East Brunswick Township, New Jersey|East Brunswick]] by State Trooper James Harper and backed up by Trooper Werner Foerster, for driving with a broken taillight, only 200 yards (183 meters) away from a police administration building.<ref name="kirsta"/> Accounts of the confrontation differ (see the [[Assata Shakur#Witnesses|witnesses section]] below), but Zayd Shakur and Trooper Foerester were killed in the ensuing shootout, and Assata Shakur and Trooper Harper were injured. Acoli then drove the car (a white [[Pontiac LeMans]] with [[Vermont]] [[license plate]]s)<ref name="kirsta"/>&mdash;which contained Assata, who was wounded, and Zayd, who was dead or dying; several miles down the road, where Assata Shakur was apprehended. Acoli then exited the car and fled into the woods and was captured after a manhunt the following day.<ref>Marpessa Kupendua. 1998, January 28.

==Trials==
Between 1973 and 1977, in [[New York]] and [[New Jersey]], Shakur was indicted ten times, resulting in seven different criminal trials, including two [[bank robbery|bank robberies]], the [[kidnapping]] of a [[Brooklyn]] [[heroin]] dealer, [[attempted murder]] of two [[Queens]] police officers steming from a [[January 23]], [[1973]] failed ambush, and the murder of a New Jersey state trooper.<ref name= "taylor"> {{ cite news

===Defense attorneys===
Shakur's defense attorneys included [[Lennox Hinds]], [[William Kunstler]], [[Evelyn Williams]], [[Bob Bloom]], [[Florynce Kennedy]], [[Ray Brown (lawyer)|Ray Brown]], and Stanley Cohen, who died of unknown causes early on in Shakur's last trial.<ref name="nelson"/><ref>''Assata'', p. 247.</ref> Her attorneys, in particular Lennox Hinds, were often held in [[contempt of court]], which the [[National Conference of Black Lawyers]] cited as an example of systemic bias in the judicial system.<ref>''New York Times''. May 9, 1977. Page 67, Column 6.</ref> The New Jersey Legal Ethics Committee also investigated complaints against Hinds for comparing Shakur's murder trial to "legalized lynching"<ref>''New York Times''. March 2, 1977. Section 2, Page 21, Column 2.</ref> undertaken by a "[[kangaroo court]]."<ref name="kirsta"/> Judge Appleby also threatened Kunstler with dismissal and contempt of court after he delivered an [[October 21]], [[1976]] speech at [[Rutgers University]] which in part discussed the upcoming trial,<ref>Martin Waldron. December 3, 1976. ''New York Times''. Section 2, Page 21, Column 1.</ref> but later ruled that Kunstler could represent Shakur.<ref>''New York Times''. December 15, 1976. Section 2, Page 53, Column 1.</ref> Until obtaining a court order, Williams was forced to strip naked and undergo a body search before each of her visits with Shakur&mdash;during which Shakur was shackled to a bed by both ankles.<ref name="kirsta"/> Judge Appleby also refused to investigate a burglary of her defense counsel's office which resulted in the disappearance of trial documents.<ref name="joy"/>

===Witnesses===<!-- This section is linked from [[Assata Shakur]] -->

Sundiata Acoli, Assata Shakur, Trooper  Harper, and a New Jersey Turnpike driver who saw part of the incident were the only surviving witnesses.<ref name="williamsfacts">Evelyn A. Williams. 2005, June 25. "[http://assatashakur.org/appeal_case_facts_2005.htm Statement of Facts in the New Jersey trial of Assata Shakur]."</ref> Acoli did not testify or make any pre-trial statements, nor did he testify in his own trial or give a statement to the police.<ref>Jonathan Schuppe. February 8, 2004. "In parole bid, Chesimard cohort denies killing trooper." ''The Star-Ledger''.</ref> The driver traveling North on the turnpike testified that he had seen a State Trooper struggling with a Black man between a white vehicle and a State Trooper car, whose revolving lights illuminated the area.<ref name="williamsfacts"/>

Shakur testified that Trooper Harper shot her after she raised her arms to comply with his demand, the second shot hitting her in the back as she was turning to avoid it, and that she climbed into the backseat of the Pontiac which Acoli drove five miles (8 km) down the road and parked, and remained there until State Troopers dragged her onto the road.<ref name="williamsfacts"/>

Trooper Harper's three official reports state that after he stopped the Pontiac, he ordered Acoli to the back of the vehicle  for Trooper Foerster&mdash;who had arrived on the scene&mdash;to examine his [[driver's license]], and that after Acoli complied and as he was looking inside the vehicle to examine the [[vehicle registration|registration]], Trooper Foerster yelled and held up an ammunition clip, as Shakur simultaneously reached into her red [[purse|pocketbook]], pulled out a [[9 mm caliber|nine-millimeter weapon]] and fired at him. Trooper Harper's reports then state that he ran to the rear of his car and shot at Assata Shakur who had exited the vehicle and was firing from a crouched position next to the vehicle.<ref name="taylor"/> Under [[cross-examination]] at both Acoli and Shakur's trials, Trooper Harper admitted to having lied in these reports and in his [[Grand Jury]] testimony about Trooper Foerster yelling and showing him an ammunition clip, about seeing Shakur holding a pocketbook or a gun inside the vehicle, and about Shakur shooting at him from the car.<ref name="taylor"/><ref name="kirsta"/>

===Medical evidence===
A key element of Shakur's defense was [[forensic biology|medical testimony]] meant to demonstrate that she was shot with her hands up and that she would have been subsequently unable to fire a weapon. A [[neurologist]] testified that the [[median nerve]] in Shakur's right arm was severed by the second bullet, making her unable to pull a trigger.<ref name="hinds"/> Neurosurgeon Dr. Arthur Turner Davidson, Associate Professor of Surgery at [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]], testified that the wounds in her upper arms, armpit and chest, and severed median nerve that instantly paralysed her right arm, would only have been caused if both arms were raised, and that to sustain such injuries while crouching and firing a weapon "would be anatomically impossible."<ref name="kirsta"/><ref>Walter H. Waggoner. March 17, 1977. ''New York Times''. Section 2, Page 20, Column 3.</ref>  Dr. David Spain, a [[pathologist]] from [[Brookdale Community College]], testified that her bullet scars as well as [[X-ray]]s supported her claim that her arms were raised, and that there was "no conceivable way" the first bullet could have hit Shakur's [[clavicle]] if her arm was down.<ref>Joseph F. Sullivan. March 18, 1977. ''New York Times''. Section 2, Page 24, Column 1.</ref><ref>Joy James and T. Denean Sharpley-Whiting. 2000. ''The Black Feminist Reader''. Blackwell Publishing. ISBN 0631210075. p. 279.</ref> Judge Appleby eventually cut off funds for expert defense testimony.<ref name="kirsta"/>

===Forensic evidence and police reports===
[[Neutron activation analysis]] administered after the shootout showed no [[gun powder]] residue on Shakur's fingers; her [[fingerprint]]s were not found on any weapon at the scene, according to forensic analysis performed at the [[Trenton, New Jersey]] crime lab and the F.B.I. crime labs in [[Washington, D.C.]].<ref name="howell">Ron Howell. June 7, 1998. "Revolutionary on Ice: Assata Shakur's Cuban Exile." Newsday.</ref>

According to tape recordings and police reports made several hours after the shoot-out, when Harper returned on foot to the administration building 200 yards (183 meters) away, he did report Foerster's presence at the scene; no one at headquarters knew of Foerster's involvement in the shoot-out until his body was discovered beside his patrol car, more than an hour later.<ref name="kirsta"/>

==Imprisonment==
After the Turnpike shootings, Shakur was imprisoned in New Jersey State Reception and Correction center<ref>Ward Churchill and Jim Vander Wal. p. 410.</ref> in Yardville, [[Middlesex County, New Jersey]] and later moved to [[Rikers Island|Rikers Island Correctional Institution for Women]] in [[New York City]]<ref name="scheffler203"/> where she was kept in [[solitary confinement]].<ref name="muhammad">Muhammad, Nisa Islam. 2005, May 16.

Page 40, Column 7.</ref> [[Kamau Sadiki]] (a.k.a. Fred W. X. Hilton), a co-defendant who shared a cell with Shakur during their trial for armed robbery in the Bronx (of which both were acquitted), is believed to be the father.<ref name="kirsta"/>

On [[April 8]], [[1978]], Shakur was transferred to [[Alderson Federal Prison Camp]] in [[Alderson, West Virginia]] where she met [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] [[nationalism|nationalist]] [[Lolita Lebrón]]<ref name="scheffler203"/> and Mary Alice, a Catholic nun, who introduced Shakur to the concept of [[liberation theology]].<ref name="scheffler206">Scheffler, p. 206.</ref> At Alderson, Shakur was housed in the Maximum Security Unit, which also contained several members of the Aryan Sisterhood as well as [[Sandra Good]] and [[Lynette Fromme]], followers of [[Charles Manson]].<ref>Scheffler, p. 204.</ref> 

On March 31, 1978,<ref>''New York Times''. March 31, 1978. Section 2, Page 17, Column 3.</ref>, after the Maximum Security Unit at Alderson was closed,<ref name="scheffler206"/> Shakur was transferred to the [[Edna Mahan Correctional Facility for Women|Clinton Correctional Facility for Women]] in [[New Jersey]].<ref name="scheffler203"/> A 1979 special [[United Nations|UN]] investigation into human rights abuses of political prisoners cited Shakur as "one of the worst cases" of such abuses and including her in a "a class of victims of FBI misconduct through the COINTELPRO strategy and other forms of illegal government conduct who as political activists have been selectively targeted for provocation, false arrests, entrapment, fabrication of evidence, and spurious criminal prosecutions."<ref name="kirsta"/><ref>''Covert Action Quarterly''.

==Escape and political asylum in Cuba==
On [[November 2]], [[1979]] she escaped the [[Edna Mahan Correctional Facility for Women|Clinton Correctional Facility for Women]] in New Jersey, when three members of the [[Black Liberation Army]] visiting her drew concealed .45-caliber pistols, seized two guards as hostages and commandeered a prison van.<ref name= "NYT_1979-11-03"> {{ cite news

After her escape, Assata lived as a fugitive for the next several years. The F.B.I. circulated "wanted" posters throughout the New York-New Jersey area; her supporters hung "Assata Shakur is welcome here" posters in response.<ref name="cleaver2">Cleaver, Kathleen. 2005, August. "The Fugitive." ''Essesnce''.</ref> In July 1980, FBI director [[William Hedgcock Webster|William Webster]] said that the search for Shakur had been  frustrated by residents' refusal to cooperate, and the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that his public commitments to protect civil liberties had been "clouded" by "apparently crude sweeps" through [[Harlem]] buildings, in search of Shakur.<ref>''New York Times''. July 2, 1980. "A Cloud Over the New FBI." Section A, Page 26, Column 1.</ref> In particular, one pre-dawn [[April 20]], [[1980]] raid on 92 Morningside Avenue, during which FBI agents armed with shotguns and machine guns broke down doors, and rummaged through the building for several hours while preventing residents from leaving, was perceived by residents as having "racist overtones."<ref>''New York Times''. June 11, 1980. "Our tinderboxes for radical violence." Section A, Page 30, Column 4.</ref> In October 1980, New Jersey and New York City Police denied published reports that they had declined to raid a [[Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn]] building where Shakur was suspected to be hiding for fear of provoking a racial incident.<ref>''New York Times''.

===Extradition attempts===
In 1997, Carl Williams, the superintendent of the New Jersey State Police wrote a letter to the [[Pope John Paul II]] asking him to raise the issue of Shakur's [[extradition]] during his talks with President [[Fidel Castro]].<ref>Chicago Sun Times. 1997, December 28. "N.J. cops enlist pope; Seek help in getting fugitive out of Cuba." p. 34.</ref> During the pope's visit to Cuba in 1998, Shakur agreed to an interview with NBC journalist [[Ralph Penza]].<ref name="assataletter2">Shakur, Assata. "[http://www.assatashakur.org/escape2.htm An Open Letter from Assata]." p. 2.</ref> Shakur later published an extensive criticism of the NBC segment, which interpliced footage of Trooper Foerster's grieving widow with an FBI photo connected to a bank robbery of which Shakur had been acquitted.<ref>Assata Shakur and Ida E. Lewis. November 1, 2000. "Assata Shakur: Profiled and on the Run." ''[[The Crisis|New Crisis]]''.

In 1998, the United States Congress passed a resolution asking Cuba for her "[[extradition|return]]";  House Concurrent Resolution 254 passed 371-0 in the House and by [[unanimous consent]] in the Senate.<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d105:HC00254:@@@R House Concurrent Resolution 254].</ref> Many members of the [[Congressional Black Caucus]] later explained that they were against her extradition, but mistakenly voted for the bill which was placed on the accelerated suspension calendar, generally reserved for non-controversial legislation.<ref>Waters, Maxine. 1998, September 29.

On [[May 2]], [[2005]], the thirty-second anniversary of the Turnpike shootings, the F.B.I. classified her as a "domestic terrorist", increasing the reward for assistance in her capture to $1 million,<ref name="cleaver">Cleaver, Kathleen. 2005.

On [[December 12]], [[2006]], the Chancellor of the [[City University of New York]], [[Matthew Goldstein]], directed City College's president, Gregory H. Williams, to remove the "unauthorized and inappropriate" designation of the "Guillermo Morales/Assata Shakur Community and Student Center," which was named by students in 1989, when a student group won the right to use the lounge after a campus shutdown over proposed tuition increases.<ref>Arenson, Karen W. 2006, December 13.
