'''Historically black colleges and universities''' ('''HBCUs''') are institutions of [[higher education in the United States]] that were established before 1964 with the intention of serving the [[African American]] community. <ref name="USDEd">{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/about/inits/list/whhbcu/edlite-list.html|title=List of HBCUs|work=White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities|publisher=United States Department of Education|date=2007-08-17|accessdate=2008-02-08}}</ref> 

==Overview==
There are [[List of historically black colleges of the United States|110 historically black colleges]] in the [[United States]] today, including public and private, two-year and four-year institutions, medical schools and community colleges.  <ref name="USDEd" />

The Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, defines an HBCU as: "...any historically black college or university that was established prior to 1964, whose principal mission was, and is, the education of black Americans, and that is accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency or association determined by the Secretary [of Education] to be a reliable authority as to the quality of training offered or is, according to such an agency or association, making reasonable progress toward accreditation." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/about/inits/list/whhbcu/edlite-index.html|title=HBCUs: A National Resource|work=White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities|U.S Department of Education|date=2008-01-15|accessdate=2008-02-08}}</ref>

Other educational institutions currently have large numbers of African Americans in their student body, but as they were founded (or opened their doors to African Americans) after the implementation of the ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' ruling by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] (the court decision which outlawed [[racial segregation]] of public education facilities) and The Higher Education Act of 1965. Thus by definition they are not historically black colleges, but have been termed "predominantly black."
