The term '''Average Joe''', '''Average Jane''' or '''Average Joe-Schmoe''' is used in the United States to refer to the average American.  Today statistics by the United States Department of Commerce provide information regarding the societal attributes of those who may be referred to as being "average". While some individual attributes are easily identified as being average, such as the median income, other characteristics, such as family arrangements may not be identified as being average. In 2000 for example no single household arrangement constituted more than 30% of total households. Married couples with no children were the most common constituting 28.7% of households. It would nonetheless be inaccurate to state that the average American lives in a childless couple arrangement as 70.3% do not.<ref name="Marriages, Families & Intimate Relationships">{{cite book | last = Williams | first = Brian | authorlink = | coauthors = Stacey C.

As the United States is a highly diverse nation, it should not be surprising that there is no single prevalent household arrangement. While the "[[nuclear family]]" consisting of a married couple with their own children is often seen as the average American family, such households constitute less than a quarter of all households.<ref name="Marriages, Families & Intimate Relationships">{{cite book | last = Williams | first = Brian | authorlink = | coauthors = Stacey C.

Another 25.5% of households consisted of single persons residing alone. Recent trends have shown the numbers of nuclear families as well as childless married couples decrease. In 1970, 40.3% of US households consisted of nuclear families with childless couples making up 30.3% of households and 10.6% of households being arranged in "Other family types." By 2000 the percentage of nuclear families had decreased by 40%, while the number of other family types had increased by 51%. The percentage of single households has also steadily increased. In 1970, only 17% of households consisted of singles. In 2000 that figure had increased by 50% with singles constituting 25.5% of households. The most drastic increase was among the percentage of households made up of single males, which nearly doubled from 5.6% in 1970 to 10.7% in 2000.<ref name="Marriages, Families & Intimate Relationships">{{cite book | last = Williams | first = Brian | authorlink = | coauthors = Stacey C.

Recent statistics indeed indicate that there is no average American family arrangement, but that American society is home to a wide and diverse variety of family arrangements. The one thing the data does indicate is that the average joe most likely does not reside in a nuclear 4-person family.<ref name="Society in Focus">{{cite book | last = Thompson | first = William | authorlink = | coauthors = Joseph Hickey | year = 2005 | title = Society in Focus

"The nuclear family... is the idealized version of what most people think when they think of "family..." The old definition of what a family is... the nuclear family- no longer seems adequate to cover the wide diversity of household arrangements we see today, according to many social scientists (Edwards 1991; Stacey 1996). Thus has arisen the term ''postmodern family'', which is meant to describe the great variability in family forms, including single-parent families and child-free couples."- Brian K. Williams, Stacey C. Sawyer, Carl M. Wahlstrom, ''Marriages, Families & Intimate Relationships'', 2005.<ref name="Marriages, Families & Intimate Relationships">{{cite book | last = Williams | first = Brian | authorlink = | coauthors = Stacey C.

A statement that can be made, however, is that most Americans will marry at least once in their life time with first marriage most commonly ending in divorce. Today a little over half, 52.3% of US household include a married couple, showing a significant decrease since 1970 when 70.6% of households included a married couple.<ref name="Marriages, Families & Intimate Relationships">{{cite book | last = Williams | first = Brian | authorlink = | coauthors = Stacey C. Sawyer, Carl M. Wahlstrom | year = 2005 | title = Marriages, Families & Intimate Relationships | publisher = Pearson | location = Boston, MA | id = 0-205-36674-0}}</ref> Current trends indicate that people in the US are marrying later and less often with higher divorce rates. Despite the declining prevalence of marriage more than three quarters of Americans will marry at least once in their life time. The average age for marriage for a male was 26.8 and 25.1 for a female. Americans are also likely to re-marry after their first divorce. In 1990, 40% of all marriages are remarriages. Overall one can conclude that while there is no prevalent average household arrangement, most Americans (the Average Joe) will get married and divorced once with a considerable number of American re-marrying at least once.<ref name="Society in Focus">{{cite book | last = Thompson | first = William | authorlink = | coauthors = Joseph Hickey | year = 2005 | title = Society in Focus

==Income==

{{main|Personal income in the United States|Household income in the United States}}
[[Income in the United States]] is most commonly measured either by [[Personal income in the United States|individual]] or [[Household income in the United States|household]]. In 2005 the [[Personal income in the United States|median personal income]], the amount earned by the Average Joe or Average Jane, is largely determined by who is or who is not included in the statistics. Personal income statistics are given in accordance to a variety of demographic characteristics. The [[Personal income in the United States|median income]] for all 233 million persons over the age of 15 was $28,567.<ref name="US Census Bureau, median income for total labor force">{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/perinc/new05_001.htm|title=US Census Bureau, median income for total labor force|accessdate=2006-12-08}}</ref> By only including those above age 25, the vast majority of students and all working adolescents are excluded. The [[Personal income in the United States|median income]] for the people above the age 25 was $32,140 in 2005. Of those with incomes, over the age of 25, almost three quarters, 73.31%, the median income was clocked at $39,336 in 2005.<ref name="US Census Bureau, Personal income for all sexes, races in 2005">{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/perinc/new03_001.htm|title=US Census Bureau, Personal income for all sexes, races in 2005|accessdate=2006-11-19}}</ref>  This figure excludes those employed part-time, students, working teenagers, retires and the unemployed. Depending on whether or not those working part-time are included, the average American makes between $32,000 and $39,000.<ref name="US Census Bureau, Personal income for all sexes, races in 2005">{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/perinc/new03_001.htm|title=US Census Bureau, Personal income for all sexes, races in 2005|accessdate=2006-11-19}}</ref><ref name="US Census Bureau, median income for total labor force">{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/perinc/new05_001.htm|title=US Census Bureau, median income for total labor force|accessdate=2006-12-08}}</ref>

In 2005, 42% of all households and 76% of households in the top quintile had two or more income earners.<ref name="US Census Bureau, Income quintiles, income earners per household, 2006">{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/hhinc/new05_000.htm|title=US Census Bureau, Income quintiles, income earners per household, 2006|accessdate=2006-01-11}}</ref> As a result there was a considerable discrepancy between household and personal income. Recent studies, such as the one conducted by Harvard professor Elizabeth Warren, have shown that the average American household needs two incomes in order to life what is commonly perceived as a middle-class lifestyle.<ref name="Middle income can't buy Middle class lifestyle">{{cite web|url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2003/10.30/19-bankruptcy.html|title=Middle income can't buy Middle class lifestyle|accessdate=2006-01-11}}</ref> The median income per household member was clocked at $24,672 in 2005. This means that the average Joe earns roughly $32,000 a year, lives in a household with an income of $46,000 with $24,000 of gross annual income per member.<ref name="US Census Bureau, Household income, 2006">{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/hhinc/new02_001.htm|title=US Census Bureau, Household income, 2006|accessdate=2006-01-11}}</ref> Personal income changes considerably over the life-time of the average American, from $28,000 at age 25 to about $42,000 at the age of 65. Yet, very young and old persons would commonly not be considered to be average Americans.

Most Americans today are white collar salaried employees who work in varied environments, from comfortable offices, retail outlets to hospitals. Roughly one quarter, 23.4%, of Americans were employed in the traditional blue collar fields that require hard physical labor with another 14% employed in the service industry.<ref name="US Census Bureau report on educational attainment in the United States, 2003">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/p20-550.pdf|title=US Census Bureau report on educational attainment in the United States, 2003|accessdate=2006-07-31}}</ref> Office administrators or more colloquial, secretaries, were the largest single occupation in the United States. In 2004 there were 4.1 million secretaries with a median income of $34,970, near the national median of $32,000.<ref name="US Department of Labor, Office administrators in the US">{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos151.htm|title=US Department of Labor, Office administrators in the US|accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref> Overall those employed in office administrative and support, service and sales occupations constituted 38.6% of the labor force. Those employed in business and professional as well as professional support occupations (e.g. nurses) made up 38.0% of the labor force. Combined white collar employees including service workers such as restaurant serves and hotel maids constituted 76.6% of the labor force. If service workers are excluded 62.8% were employed in white collar occupations. Educational attainment varied greatly depending on occupational field with 68% of those in the professional and professional support fields having a Bachelor's degree of higher, compared to only 31.6% of those employed in sales and 11.6% of those in the service sector. Considering the fact that the average American does not have a Bachelor's degree, he or she is most likely employed in the service, sales, and office support fields with many working in the professional support and business fields as well. Overall the American economy and labor force have changed greatly since the middle of the 20<sup>th.</sup> century with most worker today being employed in office and service occupations.<ref name="US Census Bureau report on educational attainment in the United States, 2003">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/p20-550.pdf|title=US Census Bureau report on educational attainment in the United States, 2003|accessdate=2006-07-31}}</ref>

According to US Department of Commerce data the vast majority, 67% of housing units in the United States were [[Homeownership in the United States|owner occupied]], had 3 or fewer bedrooms with 1 or less occupant per room (including kitchen, dining room, living room, etc...) and were mortgaged.<ref name="US Census Bureau, Housing Charateristics, 2005">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ADPTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=01000US&-qr_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_DP4&-ds_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_&-_lang=en&-_sse=on|title=US Census Bureau, Housing Charateristics, 2005|accessdate=2007-01-14}}</ref> The overwhelming majority, 85%, of all housing units had three or fewer bedrooms while 15% of all housing had 4 or more bedrooms. The plurality of housing units, 40%, had three bedrooms. The vast majority, 67%, of housing units were mortgaged with 52% households spending 25% or less of their [[Household income in the United States|annual income]] on mortgage payments. The [[Real estate pricing|median value]] of a housing unit in the US was $167,500 in 2005 with the median mortgage payment being clocked at $1,295. The average size of a household was 2.5 persons with almost all housing units, 97%, having 1 or fewer occupants per room. One should note, however, that the term "room" does not exclusively refer to bedrooms, but includes the kitchen, dining room, family room, bath rooms and any other rooms a house might have. While 85% of American homes had 3 or fewer bedrooms the median number of total rooms per housing units was 5.3 in 2005.<ref name="US Census Bureau, Housing Charateristics, 2005">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ADPTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=01000US&-qr_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_DP4&-ds_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_&-_lang=en&-_sse=on|title=US Census Bureau, Housing Charateristics, 2005|accessdate=2007-01-14}}</ref> Considering these statistics one can conclude that the average American resides in his or her [[Homeownership in the United States|own home]], pays roughly $1,000 per month in mortgage payments for a three or less bedroom house with no more than 1 occupant per room.<ref name="US Census Bureau, Housing Charateristics, 2005">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ADPTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=01000US&-qr_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_DP4&-ds_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_&-_lang=en&-_sse=on|title=US Census Bureau, Housing Charateristics, 2005|accessdate=2007-01-14}}</ref>

US Census Bureau data from 2002 identified a series of housing characteristics for units owner-occupied units inhabited by households with average incomes, ragning from $40,000 to $60,000. The median square footage for homes occupied by middle income households was 1,700 with 52% of such homes having two or more bathrooms. The median value of these homes was $112,000 with the median year of construction being 1970. Middle income households tended to spend roughly 18% of their monthly income on housing. Considering these statistics it is likely that many average Americans reside in 1,700 square foot homes, priced slightly above $100,000 with two or more bathrooms that were built in the late 1960s and early 1970s.<ref name="The Structure of Social Stratification in the United States">{{cite book | last = Beeghley | first = Leonard | authorlink = | coauthors = Joseph Hickey | year = 2004 | title = The Structure of Social Stratification in the United States | publisher = Pearson | location = New York, New York| id = 0-205-37558-8}}</ref>

==Criticism==
While the notion of an "average person" is used extensively, some researchers warn of inherent controversies of the statistical approach, which must be taken with caution. As [[John Allen Paulos]] quipped, "The statistic is that the average resident of [[Miami, Florida]], is born [[Hispanic]] and dies [[Jewish]]".<ref>[[John Allen Paulos]] (1998) "Once Upon a Number: The Hidden Mathematical Logic of Stories", ISBN 0465051596</ref>
