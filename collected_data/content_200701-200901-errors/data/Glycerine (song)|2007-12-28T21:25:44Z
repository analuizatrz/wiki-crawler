'''"Glycerine"''' is the 4th single from [[grunge]] band [[Bush (band)|Bush]]'s debut album ''[[Sixteen Stone]]''. Bush had increasing popularity in the United States with the band's singles doing well on America. With the third single "[[Comedown]]," Bush reached number 1 on the [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart for two weeks. "Glyercine" did the same. The song arguably is Bush's most recongnizable song. Thanks to the success of ''Sixteen Stone'', the follow up album ''[[Razorblade Suitcase]]'' debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200, and sold 3,000,000 copies.  
The video for Glycerine was notable for being shot in a very short time period when the band was on tour in the United States.  The video was shot so quickly because the band's visas had expired.  In spite of being very simple and unadorned, the video was highly acclaimed and won several awards, including the [[MTV Video Music Award - Viewer's Choice]] from the 1996 [[MTV Video Music Awards]].

The song is also well known for being performed live, solo, by Gavin Rossdale, during a heavy storm at the 1996 MTV Spring Break. Footage of the performance was put into video rotation by MTV.

Glycerine is also featured on [[Buzz Ballads]] soundtrack, offered by musicspace.com (2006).

Glycerine came 5th in Australia's Triple J Hottest 100 in 1996.

The song was also featured in the season 4 premiere of CBS's [[Cold Case]] entitled "Rampage".

Glycerine has also been covered by many bands, usually played with an acoustic guitar.

Glycerine is played in the key of F Major on Sixteen Stone.

The main riff of Glycerine is based on a widely used chord progression that can be heard in songs such as the [[Only One]]'s "[[Another Girl, Another Planet]]", [[Journey]]'s "[[Don't Stop Believing]]" [[Green Day]]'s "[[When I Come Around]]", and an unreleased [[Neutral Milk Hotel]] song known as "[[Bucket]]".
