A '''cannon''' is any large tubular [[firearm]] designed to fire a heavy [[projectile]] over a long distance. The cannon is the archetypical form of [[artillery]].

==Etymology and terminology==
'''Cannon''' comes through [[Old French]] from [[Italian language|Old Italian]] ''cannone'', ultimately derived from [[Latin]] ''canna''&mdash;a tube.<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/61/5/C0070500.html American Heritage Dictionary]</ref> The Latinised word ''canon'' was used for a gun since 1326 in Italy, and 1418 in England. ''Bombardum'', or "bombard", was earliest used for "cannon", but from 1430 it came to refer only to the largest weapons.<ref name="Nitrates">[http://www.du.edu/~jcalvert/tech/cannon.htm]</ref> "Cannon" serves both as the singular and plural of the noun, although the plural "cannons" can also be used. The term can apply to a modern day [[rifled]] [[machine gun]] with a [[calibre]] of 20 mm or more (see [[autocannon]]).

'''Cannon''' also refers to a large, smooth-bored, [[muzzle-loading]] [[gun]] used before the advent of [[breech-loading]], [[rifled]] guns firing explosive [[shell (projectile)|shells]]. Although a variety of such guns are commonly referred to as "cannon", the term specifically refers to a gun designed to fire a 42 lb shot as opposed to a "[[Demi-cannon]]" (32 lb), [[Culverin]] (18 lb) or [[Demi-culverin]] (9 lb).

When on board a warship a cannon is called a '''gun''', while a cannonball is a '''roundshot'''.

==History==
===Early history===
{{details|Gunpowder|the history of gunpowder}} <!-- details of gunpowder belong in that other article but some mention is needed here for context -->
[[Image:Joseon era cannon arrow.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Korean cannon]] arrow from the early [[Joseon Dynasty]].]]
"Fire lances", gunpowder-propelled arrows, were used in China from at least [[1132]]. The first documented record of artillery with gunpowder propellent used on the battlefield is on [[January 28]], [[1132]] when General [[Han Shizhong]] of the [[Song Dynasty]] used [[escalade]] and [[Huochong]] to capture a city in [[Fujian]]. In [[1221]], cast iron bombs thrown by hand, sling, and catapult are mentioned. Somewhere around [[1249]], the Chinese of the [[Song Dynasty]] began to load early gunpowder in the middle of thick bamboo as a projection firearm, firing clay pellets like a shotgun.

Around the time of the wars between the [[Mongols]] and the [[Song Dynasty]] ([[1268]]-[[1279]]), mortars with bronze tubes or bronze first appeared.<ref>{{cite book | author= Gernet, Jacques | title=A History of Chinese Civilisation | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1996 | id=ISBN 0-521-49781-7}}</ref> (However, the earliest certain example is dated [[1332]]). Additionally, the Chinese and Mongols took up the use of "true" gunpowder instead of the slower-burning older mixture - which made this early cannon, known as the [[Huochong]], more reliable and powerful. During wartime, the Chinese used the early gunpowder weapons in defence against the [[Mongols]], mounting more than 3,000 bronze and iron casted cannons on the [[Great Wall of China]]. The weapon was taken up by the Mongol conquerors later, and was also used in [[Korean cannon|Korea]]. Many of the earliest weapons seem to primarily have functioned as psychological weapons, a trait gunpowder arms would keep for a long time.

The invention of [[gunpowder]] spread into [[India]] prior to the Mongol intrusion in China. In India, gunpowder was manufactured and used in both [[rocket]]ry and for powering cannon. Even before this however, the Indians used rudimentary projectile weapons to launch stones and explosive/incendiary objects at besieging armies. The [[Arthashastra]] mentions a tubular weapon, the Sataghni. Indigenous gunpowder was called ''agnicurna''. By the [[16th Century]], the world's largest and heaviest cannon were being cast in India. The best examples of this are the Jaivana Cannon in Jaigarh, Rajasthan and the Thanjavur Cannon in Thanjavur armories in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu. The "giant gun" trend was by then disappearing in Europe, in favor of lighter, more manoeuvrable pieces in larger numbers, and the early use of true field artillery.

===Medieval Europe and the Middle East===
{{main|Cannon in the Middle Ages}}
The first mention of the composition of gunpowder in express terms in Europe appeared in [[1216]], in [[Roger Bacon]]'s "''De nullitate magiæ''" at Oxford.<ref>{{cite book 
 |title=Encyclopedia Britannica
 |year=1771
 |location=London
 |chapter=Gunpowder
 |quote = <!-- original uses Long s  --> frier Bacon, our countryman, mentions the compoſition in expreſs terms, in his treatiſe ''De nullitate magiæ'', publiſhed at Oxford, in the year 1216.
}}; Note the [[Long s]]</ref>  Later in [[1248]], his "''Opus Maior''" describes a recipe and recognized military use:
{{long quotation|"We can, with saltpeter and other substances, compose artificially a fire that can be launched over long distances... By only using a very small quantity of this material much light can be created accompanied by a horrible fracas. It is possible with it to destroy a town or an army ... In order to produce this artificial lightning and thunder it is necessary to take saltpeter, sulfur, and Luru Vopo Vir Can Utriet".}}

Bacon described firecrackers, "used in certain parts of the world". Bacon's mixture resembles the assumed composition of Chinese slow-burning powder as used in fire arrows and rockets, but will probably not function well as cannon gunpowder - the saltpeter content is too low. Gunpowder was first used in Spain by Moorish cannon at the siege of [[Seville]] in [[1248]], and the siege of [[Niebla, Huelva|Niebla]] in [[1262]].<ref name="ArabRockets">[http://www.history-science-technology.com/Articles/articles%203.htm]</ref> By 1260, "coal and sulphur" had been recognised as the best weapon for [[naval warfare|ship-to-ship combat]],<ref>[http://www.mediumaevum.com/75years/mirror/sec2.html#XXXIX King's Mirror, Chapter XXXVII: The duties, activities and amusements of the Royal Guardsmen]</ref> while hand guns were probably in use at this time, such as against the [[Mongols]], and Italian ''scopettieri'' ("gun bearers") were mentioned in conjunction with crossbowmen in [[1281]]. The Spanish historian [[Jeronimo Zurita y Castro|Zurita]] recorded cannon at the  siege of [[Alicante]] in [[1331]],<ref>Partington,  J. R., A History of Greek Fire and Gunpowder, reprint by Johns Hopkins University Press, p. 191 (Latin text of Zurita)</ref><ref name="ArabRockets"/> and by [[1340]], light cannon were widespread enough in the Islamic world to end up in military inventories. The Spanish Kings enlisted "the first artillery-masters on the Peninsula" in the mid-14th century.<ref>Ada Bruhn de Hoffmeyer, ''Arms and Amour in Spain'', p. 217.</ref>

[[Image:Arrow fireing cannon.JPG|thumb|right|A reconstruction of the vase cannon that fired arrows.]]
[[Juan de Mariana]] recalled further use of cannon during the capture of [[Algeciras]] in [[1342]], and also related that the English Earl of [[Derby]] and Earl of [[Salisbury]] had both participated in the siege.<ref>Mariana,.Juan de, Historia general de Espana, 2 volumes,  Madrid, 1608, ii, 27; English tr. by Capt. John Stephens, The General History of Spain, 2 parts., London, 1699. Part one, p.2 64.</ref><ref name="ArabRockets"/> They could had conceivably transferred the knowledge about the effectiveness of cannon to England.<ref>Watson, R., Chemical Essays, vol. I, London,1787, 1999. p.331</ref> Cannon certainly saw its first real use on the European battlefield during the [[Hundred Years War]], being only used in small numbers by a few states during the [[1340s]]. "Ribaldis" were first mentioned in the English Privy Wardrobe accounts during preparations for the [[Battle of Crécy]] between [[1345]] and [[1346]].<ref name="Nicolle">''Crécy 1346: Triumph of the longbow'', David Nicolle, [[Osprey Publishing]] Paperback; June 25 2000; ISBN 9781855329669</ref> These were believed to  have shot large arrows and simplistic grapeshot, but they were so important they were directly controlled by the Royal Wardrobe.<ref name="Nicolle"/> According to the contemporary [[Jean Froissart]], the English cannon made "two or three discharges on the [[Genoese]]", which is taken to mean individual shots by two or three guns because of the time taken to reload such primitive artillery.<ref name="Nicolle"/> The Florentine [[Giovanni Villani]] agreed that they were destructive on the field, indicating that by the end of the battle, "the whole plain was covered by men struck down by arrows and cannon balls."<ref name="Nicolle"/>

Similar cannon appeared also at the [[Siege of Calais]] in the same year, although it would not be until the 1380s that the "ribaudekin" clearly became mounted on wheels.<ref name="Nicolle"/> Around the same period, the [[Byzantine Empire]] began to accumulate its own cannon to face the [[Ottoman]] threat, starting with medium-sized cannon 3 feet long and of 10" calibre.<ref name="Constantinople">''[http://www.ospreypublishing.com/title_detail.php/title=S759X~ser=FOR The Walls of Constantinople, AD 324–1453]'', [[Osprey Publishing]], ISBN 1-84176-759-X. </ref> The first definite use of artillery in the region was against the Ottoman siege of [[Constantinople]] in [[1396]], as the attackers did not yet have any gunpowder of their own. These loud Byzantine weapons, possibly operated by the Genoese or "[[Franks]]" of [[Galata]], forced the Turks to withdraw.<ref name="Constantinople"/>
[[Image:Dardanelles Gun Turkish Bronze 15c.png|thumb|250px|left|The [[Dardanelles]] Gun, used by the Turks at Constantinople.]] 
The Turks acquired their own cannon by the siege of [[1422]], using "[[Falconet (cannon)|falcons]]", which were short but wide cannon. The two sides were evenly matched technologically, and contemporary sources credit the lifting of the siege to an apparition of the Theotokos upon the city walls.<ref name="Constantinople"/> Pius II promoted the affordable donation of cannon by European monarchs as a means of aid to the Empire, which was facing economic problems at the time, but aside from these no other advances were made to the Byzantine arsenal.<ref name="Constantinople"/> The Turks, on the other hand, saw that they needed heavy cannon to breach the [[Walls of Constantinople]], using 68 Hungarian-made cannon in 1453. The largest required an operating crew of 200 men,<ref name="Trivia Library">[http://www.trivia-library.com/b/military-and-war-weapons-the-cannon.htm]</ref> and 70 oxen and 10,000 men just to transport them.<ref name="Constantinople"/> They were extremely loud, adding to their psychological impact, and the 55-day bombardment of [[Constantinople]] left massive destruction; the Greek chronicler Kritovoulos recorded that cannonballs "hit the wall, which it immediately shook and knocked down and was itself broken into many fragments and scattered, hurling the pieces everywhere and killing those who happened to be nearby."<ref name="Constantinople"/>

Byzantine counter artillery allowed them to repel any visible Turkish weapons, and the defenders repulsed any attempts to storm any broken points in the walls and hastily repaired any damage. However, the walls could not be adapted for artillery, and there was even worry that the largest Byzantine cannon could cause more damage to their own walls than the Turkish cannon.<ref name="Constantinople"/> Gunpowder had also made the formerly devastating [[Greek fire]] obsolete, and with the final fall of what had once been the strongest walls in Europe on [[May 29]], "it was the [[Late Middle Ages|end of an era]] in more ways than one".<ref name="Constantinople"/>

===Post-Medieval Use===
[[Image:Tsar-Pushka.jpg|thumb|[[1586]] [[Tsar Cannon]], the largest [[howitzer]] ever made, by [[Andrey Chokhov]].]]
The end of the Middle Ages saw the construction of larger and more powerful cannon, and their spread in warfare throughout the world. The ''Tsar Pushka'' (''Царь-пушка'' in [[Russian language|Russian]], literally "[[Tsar]]-cannon"), [[foundry|founded]] by Russian founding master [[Andrey Chokhov]] in [[1586]], was the largest [[howitzer]] ever made. The cannon, which still survives today, weighed nearly 18 [[tonne]]s and had a length of 5.34 [[metre]]s, a calibre of 890 [[millimetre|mm]], and an external diameter of 1200 mm. The cannon was intended to fire [[grapeshot]] and to defend [[the Kremlin]], but was never used. In fact, with such a large cannon, it may have been intended as a showpiece of military might and engineering from the beginning.

Conventional siege artillery, such as [[siege tower]]s and trebuchets, became vulnerable and obsolete with the development of large cannon and changes in fortification. However, constructions known as "battery-towers" took on a similar role as siege towers in the [[gunpowder]] age. These were built out of wood on site and were used for concentrating siege cannon on a particular point in a fortification. One of these was built by the [[Russians|Russian]] [[military engineer]] [[Ivan Vyrodkov]] during the [[siege of Kazan]] in [[1552]] (as part of the [[Russo-Kazan Wars]]), and could hold ten large-calibre cannon and 50 lighter cannon.<ref name="Kazan">''[http://www.ospreypublishing.com/title_detail.php/title=S9169 Russian Fortresses, 1480–1682]'', [[Osprey Publishing]], ISBN 1-84176-916-9</ref>
[[Image:Fortbourtange.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A [[Vauban]]-style [[Star fort]], showing the influence of cannon on fort design.]] 
East Asia also saw the construction of massive cannon. The [[Jaivana cannon]], now located at [[Jaigarh Fort]] of [[Jaipur]], is considered to be the largest wheel-mounted cannon ever made in the world. Made in [[1720]] during the reign of Maharaja Sawai [[Jai Singh II]], it is a decorative piece only, having never been introduced in a battle. Records say that it was fired once and its shot went to "Chaksu", about 40 kilometres away from Jaipur.

During [[Japanese invasions of Korea]],1592-1599, the Korean ([[Joseon dynasty]]) battleships equipped with many cannons played a critical role in stopping Japanese supply by defeating the Japanese navy. Japanese had [[musket]], which was more effective than any other Korean individual firearm. But the superiority of Korean cannon enabled the Korean navy to defeat the invader with a few casualty. 

By the end of the 18th century, principles long adopted in Europe specified the characteristics of cannon of the British Ship design and the types and sizes of acceptable defects.  The U.S. Navy tested guns by measurement, proof by powder (two or three firings), and using compressed water for leak detection.<ref name="NavyBarbaryI">{{cite book

===19th century===
[[Image:Utah Battery San Juan Bridge.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|U.S. troops fire during [[1899]] [[Battle of Manila (1899)|Battle of Manila]].]]
The Turkish cannons of the siege of Constantinople, after being on permanent display for four centuries, were used to battle a British fleet in [[1807]]. The artillery hit a British ship with two 700 pound cannonballs, killing 60 sailors. In 1867, Sultan Abdul Aziz gifted [[Queen Victoria]] the 17 ton "Dardanelles Gun" - one of the cannons used at the siege of Constantinople.<ref name="Trivia Library"/>

But in contrast to this antiquited weapons, later western guns during the 19th century became massive, destructive, more accurate, and covered a very long range - such as the American 3 inch wrought-iron muzzle-loading [[howitzer]] used during the [[American Civil War]] with an effective range of over 1.83km.

The superior cannon technology of Westerners in later years would bring them tremendous advantages in warfare. For example, in the [[Opium War]] in China during the 19th century, the British battleships bombarded the coastal areas and fortifications safe from the reach of the Chinese cannon.

===Modern cannon===
[[Image:Soldiers firing a 40mm saluting cannon.JPEG|thumb|left|U.S. Navy sailors firing a 40 mm saluting cannon]]

A modern artillery piece is generally referred to either as a "gun", or by the name of its specific type, such as a [[Howitzer]].  

Since [[World War II]] the term ''cannon'' is used to refer to a gun of around 20 mm to 125 mm calibre, sometimes with an automatic loading [[Firearm action|action]] capable of firing explosive [[ammunition]], an ''[[auto-cannon]]''.

The minimum calibre of a cannon, 20 mm, has been a ''[[de facto]]'' standard since [[World War II|WWII]], when heavy machine guns of 12.7 mm (0.5 inches) and 13.2 mm calibre were used side by side with 20 mm and larger guns, the latter using explosive ammunition, e.g., [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] fighters with 20 mm Hispano cannon and [[Luftwaffe]] with 20 mm and [[30 mm caliber|30 mm]] cannon. The [[Bofors 40 mm gun]] and [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon]] are two examples largely used during the Second World War, and still in usage today.
[[Image:5-54-Mark-45-firing edit.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A ship's cannon frozen mid shot.]]
Most nations use these modern (auto-) cannon on their lighter vehicles. Typical of the type is the [[25 mm caliber|25 mm]] [[M242|'Bushmaster']] cannon mounted on the [[LAV 25|LAV]] and [[M2 Bradley|Bradley]] [[Infantry fighting vehicle|armoured vehicles]].

Today United States 152 mm artillery fires [[MGM-51 Shillelagh|Shillelagh missiles]], which are guided to their targets by [[infra-red]] beams, while the [[Super High Altitude Research Project]] artillery can fire shells 75.75 mi. above the earth's surface.<ref name="Trivia Library"/>

A cannon generally refers to a high velocity, low trajectory, direct fire weapon such as the main gun on most modern main battle tanks.

A howitzer generally refers to a weapon using a lower velocity than a cannon, which fires on a higher trajectory, and provides indirect fire.

These are both differentiated from a [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]], which fires a low velocity (by comparison) round at very high trajectory at much more limited range.

==Operation==
===Projectiles fired from cannon===

[[Image:Different types of cannon balls Vasa.jpg|thumb|Different types of cannon balls recovered from the [[Regalskeppet Vasa|Vasa]], sunk in 1628]]
[[Image:Cannon diagram.PNG|right|frame|Essential parts of a cannon: 1. the [[projectile]] or cannonball (shot) 2. [[gunpowder]] 3. [[touch hole]] (or vent) in which the [[Fuse (explosives)|fuse]] or other ignition device is inserted]]

; '''[[Round shot]]''' : A solid projectile made, in early times, from dressed stone but, by the 17th century, from iron.  The most accurate projectile that could be fired by a smooth-bore cannon, used to batter the wooden hulls of opposing ships, forts, or fixed emplacements, and as a long-range anti-personnel weapon.
; '''[[Chain shot]]''' or '''bar shot''' : Two sub-calibre round shot (a good deal smaller than the bore of the barrel) linked by a length of chain or a solid bar, and used to slash through the [[rigging]] and sails of an enemy ship so that it could no longer manoeuver. It was inaccurate and only used at close range.  '''Two-headed bullets (angels)''' were similar but made of two halves of a ball rather than two balls.<ref name="EB1771">{{cite book
 |title=Encyclopedia Britannica
 |year=1771
 |location=London
 |chapter=Gunnery
}}</ref>
; '''[[Canister shot]]''' : An anti-personnel projectile which included many small iron round shot or [[lead]] [[musket]] [[ball]]s in a metal can, which broke up when fired, scattering the shot throughout the enemy personnel, like a large [[shotgun]].
; '''[[Shrapnel]] or case shot''' : An iron anti-personnel projectile containing an interior cavity packed with lead or iron round balls around a small bursting charge of just enough force to break open the thin-walled iron projectile. A powder train in a thin iron sleeve led to a time fuze inserted into a holder at the outer edge or the projectile. The fuze was designed to be ignited by flame from the propellant charge. Ideally the case shot fuze would detonate the central bursting charge when the projectile was six to ten feet above the heads of enemy infantry thereby showering them with the iron balls and fragments of the casing. (Invented 1784 by Lt. [[Henry Shrapnel]], Royal Artillery, Great Britain).
; '''[[Shell (projectile)|Shell]]''' : An explosive anti-material and counter-battery projectile, of iron with a cavity packed with a high explosive bursting charge of powder used to destroy enemy wagons, breastworks, or opposing artillery. Two types of fuzes were used -- impact fuzes that detonated the bursting charge by percussion, and time fuze cut to length measured in seconds and ignited by flame from the propellant charge.  (Source: Ordnance & Gunnery, J.G. Benton, 1859, U.S. Military Academy)
; '''[[Grapeshot]]''' : An anti-personnel weapon, similar to canister shot, but with the shot being contained in a [[canvas]] bag, and generally of a larger calibre. So called because of the resemblance of the clustered shot in the bag to a cluster of grapes on the vine. In one variation of this, the shot was held together by a coiled bar, and was spread by a fused charge in the same way as a shell.
; '''[[carcass (projectile)|Carcass]]''' : An incendiary/antipersonnel projectile designed to burn fiercely and produce poisonous fumes. It was constructed of an iron frame bound with [[sack cloth]] and filled with various ingredients such as [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]], [[antimony]], [[sulphur]], [[Potassium nitrate|saltpeter]], [[tallow]] and venetian [[turpentine]]. It was ignited by the cannon's propellant charge, bursting on impact with the target and releasing noxious fumes while setting fire to its surroundings. It was effectively an early [[chemical weapon]] as well as an [[incendiary]] and [[area denial weapon]].
; '''Heated (or hot) shot''' : A process where a solid iron cannonball is heated red hot in a specially-designed coal-fired furnace and then is loaded in a muzzle-loading cannon, cushioned by a substantial thickness of wet wads, and is then fired while still red hot, at flammable targets with the intention of setting them on fire. This was a much advocated tactic (and many times a very successful one) for shore based forts defending against attacks by wooden warships. Examples of these small brick furnaces may still be seen at permanently constructed pre-1860 forts in Europe and the United States. The adoption by most navies of iron hulled ships generally made these obsolete. The shot was carried on a specially-designed iron barrow or 2-man litter and, in the era of blackpowder cannon charges contained in cloth bags, occasioned much fanfare and notice as it was conveyed to the cannon muzzle as the red-hot projectile would easily ignite any carelessly handled loose powder. Any reckless or somewhat dangerous individual who seemed to draw trouble to themselves and those around them was referred to as a "Hot Shot", giving rise to the term in common use to this day.
     
; '''Spider Shot''':spider shot is a chain shot, but it has many chains instead of just 1 chain. It was not used very much, despite its effectiveness against small ships and morale.

===Cannon instruments===

Several instruments are used to service a medieval style cannon, as noted in the 1771 [[Encyclopedia Britannica]].<ref name="EB1771"/> <!-- Use here a term for loading down the bore? -->

[[Image:Cannon tools sponge.png|180px|right|]]
*The '''sponge''' <!-- or spunge? --> is a long staff or rammer with a piece of sheep or lamb skin wound about its end, to serve for scouring the cannon when discharged, before it is to be charged with fresh powder.  This cleaning prevents any spark of fire from remaining in the piece, which would endanger the life of the loading crew. Sponges were the most commonly used cannon cleaning instruments.<ref name="EB1771"/>

[[Image:Cannon tools wadscrew.png|180px|right|]]
*A '''wad-screw''' is two points of iron in the shape of a corkscrew, to extract the wad out of the piece.  Used when the cannon has to be unloaded or dirt must be removed.<ref name="EB1771"/>

[[Image:Cannon tools ladle.png|180px|right|]]
*The '''lantern''' or '''ladle''' serves to carry the powder into the piece.  It consists of a wooden box appropriated to the caliber of the piece for which it is intended with a length of a caliber and a half with its vent, and of a piece of copper nailed to the box at the height of a half caliber.  This lantern must have three calibers and a half in length, and two calibers in breadth, being rouned on the end to load the ordinary pieces.<ref name="EB1771"/>

[[Image:Cannon tools primer.png|180px|right|]] <!-- is this the right image? EB 1771 labeled it a "rammer" -->
*The '''primer''' must contain a pound of powder at least, and is used to prime the pieces.<ref name="EB1771"/>

[[Image:Cannon tools rammer.png|180px|right|]]
*A '''rammer''' is a round piece of wood, commonly called a box, which serves to drive home the powder and ball to the breech.  It is fastened to a stick twelve feet long, for the pieces from twelve to thirty-three pounders, and ten for the eight and four pounders.<ref name="EB1771"/>

[[Image:Cannon tools botefeux.png|100px|right|]] <!-- is this the right image?  EB 1771 did not label the small sticks -->
*The '''botefeux''' is used to hold a winding of match with which to fire the cannon.  May be a stick two or three feet long with a split to hold one end of the match.<ref name="EB1771"/>

[[Image:Cannon tools priming iron.png|100px|right|]]
*A '''priming iron''' is a pointed iron rod, used to clear the touch hole of the pieces of powder or dirt.  Also used to pierce the cartridge, that it may sooner take fire.<ref name="EB1771"/>

*The '''quoin of mire''' are pieces of wood with a notch on the side to put the fingers on, to draw them back or push them forward, when the gunner points his pieces.  They are placed on the sole of the carriage.<ref name="EB1771"/>

Leaden plates are used to cover the touch-hole, when the piece is charged, to keep dirt from entering the touch-hole.

It was advised to have about twenty pounds of powder in a leather sack, to avoid making trains of powder.  Accidents had been found to frequently happen when powder trains led to the magazine.

==In music==
[[Image:For_Those_About_to_Rock_We_Salute_You.JPG|thumb|right|250px|AC/DC album [[For Those About to Rock We Salute You]]]]
The cannon can be used as a kind of [[percussion]] instrument in certain pieces of music. The best known example is the ''[[1812 Overture]]'' by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], which should properly be played using an artillery section together with the orchestra. It is supposed to simulate the [[Battle of Borodino]]. The version using cannon fire was first laid down on a  recording by the [[Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra]] in the 1950s. Subsequent similar recordings have been made by other groups, exploiting the advances in audio technology. Cannon fire is used annually on the [[Fourth of July]] by the Boston Pops during their annual concert on the shores of the Charles River and by the National Symphony Orchestra during their annual concert on the steps of the US Capitol Building.

The [[hard rock]] band [[AC/DC]] also use cannon in their song ''[[For Those About to Rock (We Salute You) (song)|For those about to rock, we salute you]]''. The [[For Those About to Rock|album of the same name]] also features a cannon on its cover.

Due to their impracticalities, cannon are used for only grand, theatrical pieces, often with a military theme. In the case of the ''1812'', the cannon may be replaced with [[bass drum]]s or [[tympani]]. Less frequently strongly accented snare drum diminuendos can be heard.
