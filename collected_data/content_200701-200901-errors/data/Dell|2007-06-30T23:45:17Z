[[As of 2006]], Dell employed more than 78,700 people worldwide. Formerly holding a substantial lead in sales of PCs and of servers{{Fact|date=June 2007}}, the company [[as of 2007|recently]] slipped behind [[Hewlett-Packard]] (HP) in these markets{{Fact|date=June 2007}}. 

According to the [[Fortune 500]] 2006 list, Dell ranks as the 25th-largest company in the [[United States]] by revenue. In 2006, [[Fortune magazine]] ranked Dell as No. 8 on its annual [http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/mostadmired/top20/ list] of the most-admired companies in the United States. One publication has identified Dell as one of 38 high-performance companies in the [[S&P 500]] which consistently out-performed the market over the previous 15 years.

== History ==

[[Image:Michael Dell, square crop.jpg|thumb|left|[[Michael Dell]], the founder, chairman and CEO of Dell.]]

=== Origins and evolution ===

While still a student at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in 1984, [[Michael Dell]] founded the company as ''PC's Limited'' with just $1000. Operating from Michael Dell's off-campus dorm room at [[Dobie Center]] [http://www.dell.com/downloads/global/corporate/speeches/msd/2003_05_17_msd_commencement.pdf], the startup aimed to sell [[IBM]]-compatible computers built from stock components. Michael Dell started trading in the belief that by selling personal computer systems directly to customers, PC's Limited could better understand customers' needs and provide the most effective computing solutions to meet those needs. Michael Dell dropped out of school in order to focus full-time on his fledgling [[business]]. 

In 1985, the company produced the first computer of its own design (the "Turbo PC"), which contained an [[Intel 8088]]-compatible processor running at a speed of 8&nbsp;MHz. PC's Limited  advertised the systems in national computer magazines for sale directly to consumers, and custom-assembled each ordered unit according to a selection of options. This offered buyers prices lower than those of retail brands, but with greater convenience than assembling the components themselves. Although not the first company to use this [[business model|model]], PC's Limited became one of the first to succeed with it. The company [[gross profit|grossed]] more than $73 million in its first year.

In 1989, PC's Limited set up its first on-site-service programs in order to compensate for the lack of local retailers prepared to act as service centers. Also in 1987, the company set up its first operations in the [[United Kingdom]]; eleven more international operations followed within the next four years. In June 1988, Dell's market capitalization grew by $30 million to $80 million from its [[initial public offering]] of 3.5 million shares at $8.50 a share. The company changed its name to "Dell Computer [[Corporation]]" in 1988.

In 1990, Dell Computer Corporation tried selling its products indirectly through warehouse-clubs and computer-superstores, but met with little success, and the company re-focused on its more successful direct-to-consumer sales model. In 1992, ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine included Dell Computer Corporation in its list of the world's [[Fortune Global 500|500]] largest companies. 

In 1996, Dell began selling computers via its web site. 

In 1999, Dell overtook [[Compaq]] to become the largest seller of [[personal computers]] in the [[United States|United States of America]] with $25 billion in revenue reported in January 2000. To recognize the company's expansion beyond computers, the stockholders approved changing the company name to "Dell Inc." at the annual company meeting in 2003. 

In March 2002, Dell attempted to expand by tapping into the multimedia and home-entertainment markets with the introduction of [[television]]s, handhelds, and [[digital audio player]]s. Dell has also produced Dell-brand printers for home and small-office use. Michael Dell stepped aside as [[Chief Executive Officer]] (CEO) on [[July 16]], 2004, but retained his position as [[Chairman of the Board]]. Kevin B. Rollins, who had held a number of executive posts at Dell, became the new CEO.

On [[December 22]], [[2004]], the company announced that it would build a new assembly-plant near [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]], [[North Carolina]]; the city and county provided Dell with $37.2 million in incentive packages; the state provided approximately $250 million in incentives and tax breaks.

In January 2005, the share of sales coming from international markets increased, as revealed in the company's press releases for the first two quarters of its fiscal 2005 year. 

In February 2005, Dell appeared in first place in a ranking of the "Most Admired Companies" published by [[Fortune (magazine)|''Fortune'' magazine]].

In November 2005, ''BusinessWeek'' magazine published an article titled "It's Bad to Worse at Dell" about shortfalls in projected earnings and sales, with a worse-than-predicted third-quarter financial performance — a bad omen for a company that had routinely underestimated its earnings. Dell acknowledged that faulty capacitors on the [[motherboards]] of the Optiplex GX270 and GX280 had already cost the company $300 million. The CEO, Kevin Rollins, attributed the bad performance partially to Dell's focus on low-end PCs.

On [[March 23]], [[2006]], Dell purchased the computer hardware manufacturer [[Alienware]].  The plan anticipated Alienware continuing to operate independently under its existing management.  Alienware expected to benefit from Dell's efficient manufacturing system.

</ref>

On [[January 31]], 2007, Kevin Rollins, CEO of the company since 2004, resigned abruptly as both CEO and as a director, and Michael Dell returned to the CEO role. Investors and many shareholders had called for Rollins' resignation because of poor company performance.  At the same time, the company announced that, for the fourth time in five quarters, earnings would fail to reach consensus analyst-estimates.

In February 2007, Dell became the subject of formal investigations by the US [[Security and Exchange Commission|SEC]]
<ref> http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9002535&source=rss_news50 </ref>
and the US Attorney General for the Southern District of [[New York]].

</ref>
The company has not formally filed financial reports for either the third or fourth fiscal quarter of 2006, and several class action lawsuits
<ref>
http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/APStories/stories/D8N1MLNO0.html
</ref>
in the wake of its [[as of 2007|recent]] financial performance.  The company's lack of formal financial disclosure would normally subject the company to de-listing from the [[NASDAQ]],
<ref>
http://www.crn.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=193004297
</ref>
but the exchange has granted Dell a waiver, allowing the stock to trade normally.
<ref>
http://www.crn.com/sections/breakingnews/dailyarchives.jhtml?articleId=196903036
</ref> 

On [[March 1]], 2007, the company issued a preliminary quarterly earnings report which showed gross sales of $14.4 billion, down 5% year-over-year, and net income of $687 million (30 cents per share), down 33%.  Net earnings would have declined even more if not for the effects of eliminated employee bonuses, which accounted for six cents per share.  NASDAQ has extended the company's deadline for filing financials to [[May 4]].

=== Dell and AMD ===

On [[August 17]], 2006, a Dell [http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/corp/pressoffice/en/2006/2006_08_17_rr_000?c=us&l=en&s=corp press-release] stated that starting in September 2006, Dell Dimension desktop computers would have [[AMD]] processors and that later in the year Dell would release a two-socket, multi-processor server using [[AMD]] [[Opteron]] processors, moving away from using Dell's traditional [[Intel]] processors. 

[[CNET|CNet]]'s News.com on [[August 17]], [[2006]] [http://news.com.com/Dented+Dell+picks+up+AMD+chips+amid+SEC+probe/2100-1014_3-6106905.html?tag=nl cited] Dell's CEO Kevin Rollins as attributing the move to AMD processors to cost-advantage and to AMD technology. AMD's senior VP in commercial business, Marty Seyer, stated: "Dell's wider embrace of AMD processor-based offerings is a win for Dell, for the industry and most importantly for Dell customers."

On [[October 23]], 2006, Dell announced two new AMD-based servers — the PowerEdge 6950 and the [[PowerEdge]] SC1435 — marking its entry into the AMD-based server market.

On [[November 1]], 2006, Dell's [http://news.com.com/Dell+puts+AMD-powered+notebooks+on+sale/2100-1006_3-6131558.html?tag=nefd.top website] began offering notebooks with AMD processors (the Inspiron 1501 with a 15.4" display) with the choice of a single-core MK-36 processor, dual-core Turion X2 chips or Mobile Sempron.

=== Dell and Linux ===
On [[February 26]], [[2007]], Dell announced that it had commenced a program to sell and distribute a range of computers with pre-installed [[Linux]] distributions instead of [[Microsoft Windows]]. Dell indicated that [[Novell]]'s [[SUSE]] Linux would appear first.<ref>
http://www.itwire.com.au/content/view/9951/53/
</ref>
However, Dell on [[February 27]], [[2007]] announced that its previous announcement related to certifying the hardware as ready to work with Novell SUSE Linux and that it (Dell) had no plans to sell systems pre-installed with Linux in the near future.<ref>{{cite web

On June 27th, 2007, Dell announced on its Direct2Dell blog that, as well as now being pre-loaded on more systems (The new Dell [[Inspiron]] desktops and laptops) it was later announced that [http://direct2dell.com/one2one/archive/2007/06/27/19470.aspx it would be reaching international markets], after much support on the IdeaStorm site to bring the bundles outside of the US.

=== Michael Dell's return ===

As mentioned above, Michael Dell returned to the company as CEO on [[January 31]], 2007.  As chairman of the board, Mr. Dell had had significant input into the company's operations during Rollins' years as CEO.  That said, Michael Dell's return as CEO saw immediate changes in the company's operations, the exodus of many senior vice-presidents and new blood brought in from outside the company.

</ref> 

Mr. Dell announced a number of initiatives and plans (part of the "Dell 2.0" initiative) to improve the company's financial performance.  These include:
* elimination of 2006 bonuses for employees with some discretionary awards
* reduction in the number of managers reporting directly to Mr. Dell from 20 to 12
* in a noted departure from previous years, "build, partner, and buy" to increase services capabilities
* reduction of "[[bureaucracy]]"
Dell Inc appears to have re-focussed on reduced costs rather than on innovation, in line with the company's history of delivering units at the lowest cost possible via its direct-sales model.  In an interview with ''[[Business Week]]'', Mr. Dell stated "this is a company which can execute quite a bit better on things it already knows how to do."<ref>

=== Products ===

[[Image:DellWorkstation.jpg|thumb|right|A typical Dell-based home [[workstation]]: note the black keyboard, black flat-screen monitor and black tower.]] 

==== Scope and brands ====

The corporation markets specific brand names to different [[market segment|consumer segments]]. It typically sells the OptiPlex, Latitude, and Precision names to medium-sized and large [[business]] customers, where the company's advertising emphasizes long [[technology lifecycle|life-cycles]], reliability and serviceability. The Dimension, Inspiron, and XPS brands have an orientation towards consumers, students, and [[small office/home office|small home office]] environments, emphasizing value, performance and expandability. In 2005, Dell re-introduced the [[Dell XPS]] brand to target the lucrative [[computer games|gaming]] market. XPS desktop systems use silver rather than the black cases found on newer Dell PCs. Dell has also diversified its product line to include peripheral products such as [[Keydrive|USB keydrives]], [[Liquid crystal display television|LCD televisions]], and printers.

Dell uses several brand-names for its product ranges, including: 

*[[Dell OptiPlex|OptiPlex]] for office [[Desktop computer]] systems
*[[Dell Dimension|Dimension]] for consumer [[Desktop computer]] systems
* Dell N-Series - Desktop and notebook computers shipped with Linux or FreeDOS installed
*[[Dell Latitude|Latitude]] for commercially-focused [[laptop|notebook]]s
*[[Dell Inspiron|Inspiron]] for consumer [[laptop|notebook]]s
*[[Dell Inspiron|Inspiron]] for consumer [[Desktop computer]]s
*[[Dell Precision|Precision]] for [[Computer workstation|workstation]] systems and high-performance [[laptop|notebook]]s
*[[Dell PowerEdge|PowerEdge]] for larger corporate [[Server (computing)|server]]s
*[[Dell PowerVault|PowerVault]] for direct-attach and some network-attached [[Computer storage|storage]] ([[Network-attached storage|NAS]])
*[[Dell PowerConnect]] for network switches.
*[[Dell EMC]] for [[Computer storage|storage]] area networks
*[[Dell XPS|XPS]] for enthusiast/high-performance systems
*[[Dell Axim|Axim]] for [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]s utilizing [[Microsoft]]'s [[Windows Mobile]] (discontinued [[April 9]], 2007<ref> [http://direct2dell.com/one2one/archive/2007/04/11/11397.aspx Direct2Dell.com]</ref>)
*[[Dell Digital Jukebox]] (DJ) [[MP3 Player]]s (discontinued,  [[August 18]] 2006)
*[[Dell monitors]] [[LCD]]/[[Plasma display|plasma TVs]] and [[Video projector|projectors]] for [[High definition television|HDTV]] and [[Computer display|monitor]]
*[[Dell On Call]] - extended support services (mainly for the removal of [[spyware]] and of [[computer virus|viruses]])
*[[Dell Solution Center]] - extended support services similar to Dell On Call for EMEA customers.
* Dell Business Support - a service contract (for a fee) that provides an industry-certified technician with a lower call-volume than in normal queues. Covers hardware, and some software support
Provides three levels of support:
* Core (the system itself)
* Best Effort (trying to help a customer with an email problem or software error)
* Seamless Support (conferencing a customer in via an ISP to verify settings).
*Dell is also releasing the new value-oriented Vostro line of desktops and notebooks in July.

In [[January 30|early 2007]], Dell started shipping [[Microsoft]] [[Windows Vista]] as the default [[operating system]] for most of its new computers.
<ref>
http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/solutions/en/winvista?c=us&cs=&l=en&s=dhs
</ref> In mid-April of 2007, Dell decided, under heavy pressure from customers, to [http://www.ideastorm.com/article/show/66023/DELL_will_continue_to_sell_XP_loaded_computers bring back] the older [[Windows XP]] as an option for several consumer [[Dell Inspiron|laptops]] and [[Dell Dimension|desktops]]<ref> http://www.ideastorm.com/article/show/66023/DELL_will_continue_to_sell_XP_loaded_computers
</ref>. Some of Dell's business-oriented computers had featured Windows XP as an option even after the release of Windows Vista. It remains unknown how long Dell Inc intends to continue to provide Windows XP, as Microsoft has announced that it will no longer make Windows XP available to OEMs after the end of 2007. 

Dell also offers [[Red Hat Linux|Red Hat]] and [[SUSE]] [[Linux]] for servers; as well as "bare-bones" computers without pre-installed software ([[Dell n Series|N series]] by default and [[Dell XPS|XPS]] as well as [[Dell Inspiron|Inspiron]] notebooks upon request) at significantly lower prices. Due to Dell's licensing-contract with Microsoft, Dell cannot offer those systems on their website and customers have to request them explicitly. Dell has to ship such systems with a [[FreeDOS]] disk included in the box and must issue a so-called "Windows refund" or a merchandise credit after sale of the system at the "regular" retail price.

When Dell customers elect to use Microsoft Windows as the operating system of a newly specified Dell system, Dell bundles a large quantity of software with it.

Dell has expressed willingness to offer [[Apple Computer|Apple]]'s new [[Intel]] version of the [[Mac OS X]] operating system to its customers, but [[as of 2007|to this point]] Apple has stated that the OS will only run on [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] machines, and will not agree to licensing Mac OS X to Dell.<ref>http://www.pcworld.com/article/121421-1/article.html</ref>

==== Manufacturing ====

Dell has a general policy of manufacturing its products close to their customers, but with many exceptions.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Assembly for desktop computers for the North American market takes place at Dell plants in [[Lebanon, Tennessee]], [[Austin, Texas]], and [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]]{{Fact|date=June 2007}}; with servers built in Austin, Texas. 

Dell assembles computers for the [[Europe, the Middle East and Africa|EMEA]] market in [[Limerick]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]], and employs about 4,500 people in the country. A second EMEA facility in [[Lodz|Łódź]], [[Poland]] is currently under construction and production is planned to start there in autumn 2007<ref>http://www1.euro.dell.com/content/topics/topic.aspx/emea/corporate/pressoffice/2006/uk/en/2006_09_18_brk_000?c=uk&l=en&s=corp</ref>. 

The company plans to open a new assembly plant at [[Chennai]] in [[India]].

Dell's assembly plants in [[Penang]], [[Malaysia]], and in [[China]] assemble 95% of Dell notebooks; the remaining percentage comes from Dell European Manufacturing Facilities 1, 2, and 3 in [[Limerick]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}} For additional quality, Dell routes these computers through 'fulfillment centers' in the United States.
<!--[[Image:Dell_Headquarters_2.jpeg|thumb| Dell Headquarters]]-->

==== Service Tags ====

Dell Inc associates a '''Service Tag''', a unique number, with most of its products.

Given numerous different made-to-order PCs, the company needs a way to identify systems in its database in order to provide support for them.

The service tag number, represented in [[Base 36]], has a length of five or seven characters.

As a general rule, European service tags will end with the letter J, Chinese/Japanese tags with the letter X, Indian/Middle-Eastern tags with the letter S and all others with the number 1 - though this rule does not always apply, particularly in the cases of printers, [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]s, and televisions.

Service tags appear in the following locations:
* PCs, servers, and storage devices: On a white barcoded label on the rear of the chassis of the system.
* Notebook Computers: On a long, thin barcoded label on the underside of the notebook. 
* PDAs: Underneath the battery on the PDA itself.
* Printers: On the rear of the printer on a barcoded label.
* LCD and plasma televisions: On the rear of the set.

Dell Inc does not tag its monitors. Monitors bought as part of a system get support via the tag of the system itself. Monitors bought separately get support via the Dell Order Number or the monitor's [[serial number]].

=== Technical support ===
==== DellConnect ====

The ''DellConnect'' program, a remote-access tool, gives Dell Support technicians the ability to remotely access computers for troubleshooting purposes. By utilizing this tool, support-technicians can analyze the configuration of a system, view and edit its files and software environment, view and comment on the screen, or take control of the system (with the customer's approval) for troubleshooting purposes .

The tool has a client component (downloaded from [http://remote.dell.com remote.dell.com]) which users install on their systems. A Dell technician generates a  "Call ID", unique to each session, and sends it to the customer, who can then connect to Dell's servers and to the Dell technician by entering the "Call ID". Dell technicians can never initiate a session remotely. Before the Dell technician can view or take control of any aspect of the system, the customer sees a dialog-box requesting permission and explaining how to forcibly boot the technician from the system by pressing Alt and Escape simultaneously.

Recently, the tool was replaced by the newer Dell Connect 2.0 manufactured by Citrix, whose client application can be downloaded from [http://www.dellconnect.com]. This new application has the unique feature of letting the technician reboot the system remotely and being able to continue the same session

== Commercial aspects ==
=== Business model ===

Dell sells all its products both to end-use consumers and to corporate customers, using a direct-sales model via the [[Internet]] and the [[telephone]] network.  Dell maintains a negative [[cash conversion cycle]] through use of this model: in other words, Dell Inc. receives payment for the products before it has to pay for the materials. Dell also practices [[Just In Time (business)|just-in-time]] (JIT) inventory management, profiting from its attendant benefits. Dell’s JIT approach utilizes the “pull” system by building computers only after customers place orders and by requesting materials from suppliers as needed. In this way Dell mirrors [[Toyota]] by following Toyota Way Principle #3 ("Use 'pull' systems to avoid overproduction"). Since the original dominance of telephone ordering, the Internet has significantly enhanced Dell’s business model, making it easier for customers and potential customers to contact Dell directly. Other computer manufacturers, including [[Gateway, Inc.|Gateway]] and [[Hewlett-Packard]], have attempted to adapt this same business model, but due to timing and/or retail-channel pressures they have not achieved the same results as Dell.

=== Organization ===

A [[Board of Directors]] of nine people runs the company. [[Michael Dell]], the founder of the company, serves on the board. Other board members include [[Donald J. Carty|Don Carty]], [[William Gray]], [[Judy Lewent]], [[Klaus Luft]], [[Alex Mandl]], [[Michael A. Miles]], and [[Sam Nunn]]. [[Shareholder]]s elect the nine board members at [[meeting]]s, and those board members who do not get a majority of votes must submit a [[resignation]] to the board, which will subsequently choose whether or not to accept the resignation. The board of directors usually sets up five committees which have oversight over specific matters. These committees include the ''Audit Committee'', which handles accounting issues, including auditing and reporting; the ''Compensation Committee'', which approves compensation for the CEO and other employees of the company; the ''Finance Committee'', which handles [[financial]] matters such as proposing mergers and acquisitions; the ''Governance and Nominating Committee'', which handles various corporate matters (including nomination of the board); and the ''Antitrust Compliance Committee'', which attempts to prevent company practices from violating [[antitrust]] laws.

The corporate structure and management of Dell extends beyond the board of directors. The ''Dell Global Executive Management Committee'' sets the strategic direction for how the corporation keeps customers at the forefront, from designing and manufacturing computer systems to offering products that meet customers' requirements to providing the sufficient service and support. Dell has regional senior vice presidents for countries other than the United States, including David Marmonti for [[Europe, the Middle East and Africa|EMEA]] and Stephen J. Felice for [[Asia]]/[[Japan]]. Other officers include Martin Garvin (senior vice president for worldwide procurement) and [[Susan Sheskey|Susan E. Sheskey]] (vice president and [[chief information officer]]).

==== Support ====

Dell Inc routes technical support queries according to component-type and to the level of support purchased with a unit. Currently Dell offers four levels of customer [http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/services/en/ess_comparisonchart?c=us&cs=555&l=en&s=biz support]and encourages customers to educate themselves on the differences between these service types.

Dell Inc brands its [[As of 2006|current]] service agreements at four levels: 
# Basic
# Silver

Criticism of Dell's support sometimes suggests that many Dell telephone support agents and contractors have very poor English-language skills, and that consequently customers may find it difficult to explain their problems and understand potential solutions. 

Dell's customer-support states that, because of the variety in service types available, the Dell system sometimes transfers customer calls several times between queues before they reach the appropriate department.

Dell's agents must rigorously follow a specific troubleshooting "script" regardless of the caller's level of technical knowledge. This can frustrate IT departments, substantially lengthening resolution-time. Some IT departments have even developed "reply scripts" which call for placing Dell agents on hold if those agents instruct the customers to perform certain tests that said customers have already run prior to calling.  The caller would then return to the call after a pre-set amount of time in order to tell the agent the results of the test(s).  In fact, the lawsuit filed by the NY Attorney General in May 2007 [http://blogs.pcworld.com/staffblog/archives/delllawsuit1.pdf] states that "consumers are often held hostage for hours on end as they follow a seemingly endless array of "troubleshooting" instructions that, in many cases, do not resolve the problem."

Though the service-agreements between Dell and its customers on the higher-level support agreements (Silver, Gold, and Platinum Plus) do not specifically state the guarantee of American-agent technical support, Dell has opened up several new [http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/corp/pressoffice/en/2004/2004_10_29_rr_000?c=us&l=en&s=corp call-centers] in the United States and Canada to begin handling enterprise-class technical support requests. 

According to the Better Business Bureau however, complaints about Dell more than [http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/feb2006/tc20060223_710372.htm?chan=search doubled]in 2005, to 1,533.

In the Americas, Dell has [http://www1.ca.dell.com/content/topics/topic.aspx/ca/corporate/pressoffice/en/2005/2005_12_09_ott_000?c=ca&l=en&s=corp customer-contact centers] in Edmonton, Alberta; Ottawa, Ontario; Central Texas; Salt Lake City, Utah; Nashville, Tennessee; Chesapeake; Roseburg, Oregon; Twin Falls, Idaho; Oklahoma City, Okla; San Salvador, El Salvador; as well as Glace Bay, Nova Scotia and Panama City, Panama.

In the Asia-Pacific region Dell provides customer-support from Pasay City, Philippines; Penang, Malaysia; and Xiamen and Dalian, China. Dell [[as of 2007|recently]] opened its second Philippines site in Quezon City.

=== Marketing ===

Dell [[advertisement]]s have appeared in several types of media including [[television]], the [[Internet]], [[magazines]], [[Mail-order catalog|catalogs]] and [[newspapers]]. Some of Dell Inc's marketing strategies include lowering prices at all times of the year, offering free bonus products (such as Dell printers), and offering free shipping in order to encourage more sales and to stave off competitors. In 2006, Dell [http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/feb2006/tc20060223_710372.htm?chan=search cut its prices] in an effort to maintain its 19.2% market share. However, this also cut profit-margins by more than half, from 8.7 to 4.3 percent. To maintain its low prices, Dell continues to accept most purchases of its products via the [[Internet]] and through the telephone network, and to move its customer-care division to [[India]] and [[El Salvador]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

A popular United States television and print ad campaign in the early 2000s featured the actor [[Ben Curtis (actor)|Ben Curtis]] playing the part of "Steven," a lightly mischievous blond-haired kid who came to the assistance of bereft computer purchasers. Each television advertisement usually ended with Steven's catch-phrase: "''Dude, you're gettin' a Dell!''" Dell fired Curtis shortly after his arrest for [[marijuana]] possession in 2003 on the [[Lower East Side]] of [[Manhattan]]; however, Dell denies that the firing resulted from his arrest, stating that the "Steven" ads had run for three years and characterizing them as "stale". The Dell ads featuring Curtis had stopped playing before his arrest, thus lending credence to Dell's statement. <ref>http://www.snopes.com/radiotv/tv/delldude.asp</ref>

[[Image:Chermside dell kiosk.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Dell Direct Store, Brisbane, Australia]]
A subsequent advertising campaign featured [[intern]]s at Dell headquarters (with Curtis' character appearing in a small cameo at the end of one of the first commercials in this particular campaign).

In the early 2000s, Dell opened [[kiosk]] locations in [[shopping mall]]s across the United States in order to give personal service to customers who preferred this channel to using the Internet or telephones. Despite the added expense, prices at the kiosks equalled or even undercut prices available on Dell's other retail channels. During 2005, Dell opened [[kiosk]] locations in [[shopping malls]] across [http://www.dell.com.au/delldirectstore Australia], and in 2006 opened [[kiosk]] locations in [[shopping malls]] across [http://www.dell.ca/delldirectstore Canada], following the approach used in the United States. In Hong Kong Dell has two Customer Experience Centres, located in computer malls in Wan Chai and Mong Kok.

A Dell advertising campaign for the XPS line of gaming computers featured in print in the September 2006 issue of [[Wired Magazine]].  It used as a [[tagline]] the common term in [[Internet]] and [[gamer]] slang: "[[FTW]]", meaning "For The Win".  However, Dell Inc. soon dropped the campaign.

==== Dell Stores ====

On [[July 26]], [[2006]], Dell Inc. opened a full store in Northpark Center in [[Dallas, Texas]]. It planned to operate the 3,000-square-foot Dallas outlet  seven days a week and to display about 36 models, including PCs and televisions. But customers cannot walk out of this store with products. Instead, they order online or by telephone from the store and await delivery.  Dell Inc plans to use the Dallas store to house about three times as many products as it displays in more than 160 kiosks in malls and airports in the [[United States of America]]. In addition to showcasing products, the store also supports onsite warranties or non warranty service ("Dell on Call").  Services offered include repairing computer video-cards and removing spyware from harddrives.

=== Competition === 

Dell's major competitors include [[Apple Computer|Apple]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Sun Microsystems]], [[Gateway, Inc.|Gateway]], [[Lenovo]], [[Sony]], [[Acer (company)|Acer]], [[Toshiba]] and [[Asus]]. Dell and its subsidiary, [[Alienware]], compete in the enthusiast market against [[Falcon Northwest]], [[Voodoo PC]] (a division of [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]]), and other manufacturers. In the second quarter of 2006, Dell had between 18% and 19% share of the worldwide personal-computer [http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2006/07/19/pc_market_called_healthy_despite_weak_demand_in_europe market], compared to Hewlett-Packard with roughly 15%. By leveraging its business-model, Dell attempts to undercut competitors and offer customers a more attractive choice of personal computers and other equipment. 

Dell [[as of 2006|recently]] lost its once-substantial lead in the PC business to [[Hewlett-Packard]].  Both [[Gartner]] and [[International Data Corporation|IDC]] estimated that in the third quarter of 2006, HP shipped [http://www.forbes.com/2006/10/19/dell-computer-earnings-markets-equity-cx_mk_1019markets07.html?partner=yahootix more units] world-wide than did Dell.  Dell's 3.6% growth paled in comparison to HP's 15% growth during the same period.  The problem got worse in the fourth quarter, when Gartner [http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20070117006106&newsLang=en estimated] that Dell PC shipments declined 8.9% (versus HP's 23.9% growth).  As a result, at the end of 2006 Dell's overall PC market share stood at 13.9% (versus HP's 17.4%).

Also according to IDC, Dell lost more server market share than any of the top four competitors in that arena.  IDC's Q4 2006 estimates show Dell's share of the server market at 8.1%, down from 9.5% in the previous year.  This represents a 8.8% loss year-over-year, primarily to competitors [[EMC]] and [[IBM]].  <ref>[http://yahoo.reuters.com/news/articlehybrid.aspx?storyID=urn:newsml:reuters.com:20070312:MTFH05034_2007-03-12_21-17-33_N12385967&type=comktNews&rpc=44]</ref>

==== "Shut down Apple" ====
Dell conducted a public war-of-words with Apple CEO [[Steve Jobs]], starting when Jobs first criticized Dell for making "un-innovative beige boxes". On [[October 5]], 1997, when asked what he would do if he owned then-troubled [[Apple Computer]], Michael Dell said "I'd shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders."<ref>

== Criticism ==

In October 2005, Dell filed a lawsuit in a Paris court to sue [[Minorca|Menorca]]-based independent website designer Paul Dell [http://www.dellimages.com "Dellimages".] for engaging in “parasitism and unfair competition”. This related to his company website [http://www.dellwebsites.com "DellWebsites".]

Critics of Dell have seen Dell Inc. as "hounding" Paul Dell without justification, considering that the title of his enterprise merely reflects his [[family name]].
<ref>
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/01/26/dell_domain_dispute/
</ref> 
The case continues.
 
In 2006, Dell acknowledged that it had problems with customer service, including transfers<ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jun2006/tc20060612_046085.htm]</ref> of more than 45% of calls and long wait-times.  [http://www.direct2dell.com Dell's blog] detailed the response<ref>[http://www.direct2dell.com/one2one/archive/2006/07/13/433.aspx]</ref>: "We’re spending more than a $100 million — and a lot of blood, sweat and tears of talented people — to fix this."  Later in the year, the company increased its  spending on  customer service to $150 million<ref>[http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2006/09/18/8386121/index.htm]</ref>. 

===Use of nonstandard power connectors===

During the late 1990s (probably around 1998) Dell, who had previously been using primarily industry-standard [[ATX]] motherboards and power supplies, switched to using boards and power supplies with mechanically-identical but differently wired connectors <ref>[http://www.quepublishing.com/articles/article.asp?p=339053&rl=1]</ref>. <ref>Mueller, Scott. ''Upgrading and Repairing PCs'', 13ed, Indianapolis: Que Publications, 2002, ISBN 0789725428, and subsequent editions</ref> Dell did not disclose this transition to third parties, lessening any doubt that this was an underhanded move.  The situation was such that many people bought Dell desktop PCs on the strength that they'd be able to upgrade with ease; subsequenty they found that they either needed to buy Dell-blessed parts (visually more or less identical to standard OEM parts made by Intel and other companies) or replace their motherboard and power supply as a set. The practice supposedly ceased after 2001 but is still of concern to users of Dell hardware, and has been condemned as a form of [[vendor lock-in]].  

===Defective batteries ===

On [[August 14]], [[2006]], Dell and [[Sony]] [http://www.thestreet.com/newsanalysis/techhardware/10312018.html recalled] over 4.2 million notebook batteries after the discovery of flaws that could cause the [[Sony]]-manufactured batteries to overheat and catch fire. Subsequent announcements by almost every major laptop manufacturer in the world (including Apple, Lenovo, Toshiba, Hitachi and Fujitsu) led to a recall of nearly 9.6 million Sony-manufactured batteries and led Sony executives to [http://www.cio-today.com/story.xhtml?story_id=12000CANL8TC apologize] on [[October 24]], [[2006]] for the inconvenience.

=== North Carolina Controversy ===

In 2005 Dell began the construction of a facility in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]], [[North Carolina]]. <ref>
http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2005_Oct_25/ai_n15732802
</ref>
Many claims emerged that Dell had used unfair practices to obtain tax revenue.
<ref>
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/06/23/dell_nc_suit
</ref>
Dell fought a lawsuit which the court system later dismissed.

=== 2007 Investor Lawsuit ===
On [[January 31]] some shareholders filed a [http://www.betanews.com/article/Inside_the_Dell_Shareholder_Lawsuit_Did_Dell_and_Intel_Conspire/1170465943 lawsuit] accusing Dell and Intel of conspiring, and accusing Dell executives (including Michael Dell) of options-[[backdating]] and of propped [[financial report]]s.

=== 2007 Call-center overtime lawsuit ===
On [[February 8]], 2007 seven current and former workers at a call-center in [[Roseburg, OR|Roseburg]], [[Oregon]] sued the computer maker, saying the company worked its sales reps "off the clock", failed to provide proper rest-breaks and improperly recorded their lunch-periods.
<ref>http://atwork.blogs.oregonlive.com/uploads/487501-dellsuit.pdf</ref> Moves have begun to turn the case into a [[class action]].

=== May 2007 fraud lawsuit ===

In May 2007, the [[New York]] [[Attorney General]] [[Andrew Cuomo]] filed a lawsuit against Dell for "false advertising and deceptive business practices, including offering misleading financing, and failing to honor rebates, warranties and service contracts." [http://news.com.com/8301-10784_3-9719804-7.html?part=rss&subj=news&tag=2547-1_3-0-20]
Dell spokesman Bob Pearson portrayed the lawsuit as based on only a small portion of Dell's customers and as in no way reflecting the way the company treats its customers. Dell's hardware-warranty contract says that customers must troubleshoot over the phone — including possibly opening the computer — before Dell will send a technical service provider to replace a part.
