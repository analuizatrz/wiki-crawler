==Plot==
[[Peter Griffin|Peter]] is a contestant on ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' and wins. He chooses the prize of one week's free [[maid]] service.  After Peter's maid Joan arrives, [[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]] meets her and falls in love with her.  Later, Quagmire [[Marriage|proposes]] to her, which she accepts.  He gives up his sex-crazed, womanizing ways.

Meanwhile, Lois stops [[breastfeeding|breastfeeding]] Stewie, as he is hurting her when feeding because of his new teeth.

By the time of Quagmire's wedding, Lois' breasts have grown bigger due to excess milk.  At the reception, her huge breasts sexually arouse him, and he realizes that he has made a mistake by marrying Joan.  However, she threatens to kill him, then herself, if he tries to leave her.  So Peter and friends decide to help Quagmire fake his own death.  

Quagmire pretends to die from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]].  He is buried in a coffin with enough oxygen to last him until Peter can return after the funeral and dig him up. However, when [[Adam West (Family Guy)|Mayor West]] announces that all coffins must be buried in concrete (to guard against [[zombie]]s), Peter exclaims he is not dead, and brings Quagmire out of the coffin, alive. [[Death (Family Guy)|Death]] shows up to retrieve his body. After pleading for Quagmire's life (and touching Death's arm, thus killing her), Death takes Joan instead, as "she was [[suicide|suicidal]] and her last name was Quagmire." Lois begins to breastfeed again, delighting Stewie.

==Production==
This episode is one of the first to begin with a scene which is not the Griffin family household or the town center. It starts by depicting the game show ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]''.<ref name="Michel">{{cite video | people=Michel, Pete|year=2005|title=Family Guy season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "I Take Thee Quagmire"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> When Brian is watching ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]'' on television, a scene begins showing the mother of the fictional family screaming at the children and father. [[Jane Kaczmarek]] was asked to do the voice as she was the original actor in the series, however she refused. MacFarlane said that he gets a message that Kaczmarek wishes to portray that character as likable, and does not wish to jeopardize that.<ref name="MacFarlane">{{cite video | people=MacFarlane, Seth|year=2005|title=Family Guy season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "I Take Thee Quagmire"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The father during that scene was voiced by [[Bryan Cranston]], the original actor in the series, who accepted the role.<ref name="MacFarlane"/> [[Seth MacFarlane]] comments that "this is the first real Quagmire story we've ever done."<ref name="MacFarlane"/> A scene was made of Stewie attending a meeting similar to those at [[Alcoholics Anonymous]], however the meeting was designed for those who are too addicted to [[breast milk]].<ref name="Callaghan"/> The format of ''Wheel of Fortune'' is somewhat similar to the layout of the modern-day program, however the scene also features several aspects which are now no longer broadcast, and were featured in the 1980s.<ref name="MacFarlane"/>

==Censorship==
Two scenes during this episode were censored for television broadcasting. When Quagmire meets Joan and invites her out on a date, Cleveland asks, "Is that a banana in your pocket, or an [[erection]] in your pocket?" Although this entire scene was not censored, [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] bleeped "erection" (which, according to DVD commentary, made what Cleveland said sound worse than what was intended).<ref name="Goodman">{{cite video | people=Goodman, David|year=2005|title=Family Guy season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "I Take Thee Quagmire"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The scene where Peter is promoting '[[Crystal Pepsi]]' was shown only on the DVD, because it is prohibited to promote one product over another on television.<ref name="MacFarlane"/>

==Cultural references==
When Mayor West is playing as a contestant on ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', he spells the name of the host, [[Alex Trebek]] backwards, sending him back to the fifth dimension; this is a reference to former animated  series: ''[[Super Friends]]''.<ref name="MacFarlane"/>  When Peter and the children are flying through space and singing, this is a  reference to ''[[The Great Space Coaster]]''.<ref name="MacFarlane"/> The two Asian men who meet Peter at the traffic lights when riding Joan's back speak in a very similar tone to [[Howard Cosell]], a reference to [[1985 in film|1985]] cult film ''[[Better Off Dead (film)|Better Off Dead]]''.<ref name="Callaghan">{{cite video | people=Callaghan, Steve|year=2005|title=Family Guy season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "I Take Thee Quagmire"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref><ref name="MacFarlane"/> When Quagmire fantasises about being alone in the forest with Joan and speaking to her in [[Elvish]], this is a reference to a scene from ''[[Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref name="MacFarlane"/><ref name="Goodman"/> When Quagmire dreams about dating Joan, several references to Disney movies were made. Including: [[Beauty and the Beast]], [[Lady and the Tramp]], and being shot at by an [[Rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]] over [[Baghdad]] in [[Aladdin]]. when Peter gives the [[Statue of Liberty]]'s foot to Quagmire it cuts away to where Adam West is looking at it and says "They blew it up goddamn it, They blew it up!" this is from the last scene in [[Planet of the Apes]].

==Reception==
[[Bob Sassone]] of [[TV Squad]] commented that "this episode had one of the more hysterical/disturbing images of this TV season: Lois flashing her breasts to Brian after giving Stewie his lunch."<ref name="TVSquad">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/03/12/family-guy-i-take-thee-quagmire/|title=Family Guy: I Take Thee, Quagmire|date=March 12, 2006|accessdate=2007-12-04|author=Sassone, Bob|publisher=TV Squad}}</ref> Michael Drucker of [[IGN]] noted that "the Volume four episodes are easily funnier than the volume three ones", thus referring to the episode.<ref>[http://uk.dvd.ign.com/articles/744/744835p1.html Family Guy - Volume Four], Drucker, Michael.
