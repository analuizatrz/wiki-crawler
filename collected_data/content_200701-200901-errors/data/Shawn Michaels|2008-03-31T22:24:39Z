Sports biography|accessdate=2007-07-10|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer|CANOE]]|date=2005-03-12}}</ref> better known by his [[ring name]] '''Shawn Michaels''', is an [[United States|American]] [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]]. He performs on the [[WWE Raw|Raw]] [[WWE Brand Extension|brand]] of [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE). Currently, Hickenbottom is one of the senior performers in WWE, having joined in 1987. He is one of only two wrestlers (the other being [[The Undertaker]]) to have appeared on the very first episode of ''Monday Night Raw'' who are still with the company today.<ref>Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.251)</ref>

Before joining WWE, Hickenbottom began his wrestling career with [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Mid-South Wrestling]] and [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA). There, Hickenbottom partnered up with [[Marty Jannetty]] to form [[The Rockers|The Midnight Rockers]] and won the [[AWA World Tag Team Championship]] on two separate occasions. Hickenbottom and Jannetty then signed with the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF), while in contract with AWA. They returned to AWA, only to go back to the WWF in 1988.<ref name="WWEProfile"/>

After signing with WWF, Hickenbottom abandoned the tag team division to work in singles matches and received a new gimmick as "The Heartbreak Kid". He was alleged to be the leader of a backstage group known as [[Clique (professional wrestling)|The Clique]], which was known for breaking character during the [[Madison Square Garden]] "[[Clique (professional wrestling)#Curtain Call: The MSG Incident|Curtain Call]]" incident in 1996. The following year, Hickenbottom joined forces with [[Triple H|Hunter Hearst Helmsley]] and [[Chyna]] to form [[D-Generation X]] (DX). This [[List of professional wrestling slang#S|stable]] was known for pushing the envelope. That same year, Hickenbottom took part in the most controversial match in wrestling history dubbed as the "[[Montreal Screwjob]]". After a crippling back injury forced him to retire following his [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] loss at [[WrestleMania XIV]], Hickenbottom opened a [[Texas Wrestling Academy|wrestling academy]], in which he trained upcoming wrestlers.<ref name="WWEProfile"/> Hickenbottom made his in-ring return at [[SummerSlam (2002)|SummerSlam]] in 2002. In 2006, Hickenbottom and [[Triple H]] briefly reformed DX.

Overall, Hickenbottom is a four-time world champion: a three-time [[WWE Championship|WWE Champion]], and a one-time [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Champion]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/wwf/wwf-h.html|title= W.W.W.F./W.W.F./W.W.E.

==Career==
===Early career===
Hickenbottom was born on [[July 22]] [[1965]] in [[Chandler, Arizona]].<ref name=sm12/> The last of four children - Randy, Scott and Shari. He was raised in a military family and spent a brief part of his early years in [[Reading, Berkshire]], [[England]],<ref name=sm12/> but grew up in [[San Antonio, Texas]]. He knew he wanted to become a professional wrestler at the age of 12. Hickenbottom was already an athlete; his career began at the age of 6 when he started playing [[American football|football]].<ref name=sm15>Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.15)</ref> He was a stand-out [[Linebacker]] at [[Randolph High School (Texas)|Randolph High School]] and eventually became Captain of the football team.<ref name="WWEProfile"/><ref>Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.30)</ref> After graduating, Hickenbottom attended [[Texas State University–San Marcos|Southwest Texas State University]] in [[San Marcos, Texas]], but soon realized that college life was not for him.<ref>Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.43–49)</ref> Then he began pursuing the career of a professional wrestler. 

He was then trained by [[Mexico|Mexican]] professional wrestler [[Jose Lothario]].<ref name=sm57/><ref name=stopper/> Lothario suggested that Hickenbottom go by the ring name Shawn Michaels. After his training with Lothario, he debuted in [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Mid-South Wrestling]] in 1984 and later with Texas All-Star Wrestling (TAW) [[professional wrestling promotion|promotion]].<ref name="HAT"/> During his time with TAW, Michaels and [[Paul Diamond]] were awarded the TAW Tag Team Championship by [[Chavo Guerrero|Chavo Guerrero, Sr.]]<ref name="S.C.W. Southwest Tag Team Title">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/tx/san_antonio/scw/scw-sw-t.html|title=S.C.W. Southwest Tag Team Title|accessdate=2007-07-15|publisher=Wrestling-Titles}}</ref>

Hickenbottom also worked for [[Heart of America Sports Attractions|Central States Wrestling]].<ref>Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.75–77)</ref> There, he and tag team partner [[Marty Jannetty]] defeated The Batten Twins for the [[NWA Central States Tag Team Championship|Central States Tag Team Championship]], later losing it back to the Battens.<ref name="N.W.A.

Central States Tag Team Title|accessdate=2007-07-15|publisher=Wrestling-Titles}}</ref> Hickenbottom also made several appearances in the [[Dallas, Texas]]-based [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] throughout 1985.

===American Wrestling Association (1986–1988) ===
Michaels made his national-level debut at age nineteen for the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA), once again teaming with [[Marty Jannetty]].<ref name=stopper/> The pair were billed as "[[The Rockers|The Midnight Rockers]]" and held the [[AWA World Tag Team Championship]].<ref name=stopper/> They also appeared in the Mid-South on loan at this point. In a raid of AWA talent in 1987, The Rockers were signed by a competing promotion: the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF).<ref name=stopper/> They were fired from the WWF two weeks later, however, for "partying too hard" (a misunderstanding, according to Michaels' autobiography).<ref name=stopper/><ref>Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.116–118)</ref> They then returned to the AWA, but were re-signed by the WWF a year later.<ref>Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.128–130)</ref> 

===World Wrestling Federation===
====1988–1991====
{{main|The Rockers}}
They redebuted for the World Wrestling Federation at a [[house show]] on [[July 7]] [[1988]].<ref>Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.133)</ref> Due to WWF chairman [[Vince McMahon]]'s desire to have his performers carry WWF-exclusive monikers, they were repackaged as simply "[[The Rockers]]." The team proved popular with both children and women.<ref name=stopper/> The team was a mid-card stalwart of TV and [[pay-per-view]] shows for the next two years, but never seemed to get a chance at the WWF's Tag Team Championships.<ref name=sm148>Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.148–150)</ref>

Belatedly, in October 1990, their chance came when The Rockers were scheduled to win the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]] from [[The Hart Foundation]], as [[Jim Neidhart]], half of the championship team, was in the process of negotiating his release from the company.<ref name=sm148/><ref name="OWOW">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/s/shawn-michaels.html|title=Shawn Michaels Wrestling Profile|accessdate=2007-11-01|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> The match was taped with The Rockers [[List of professional wrestling slang#C|cleanly]] winning the belts, but soon after, Neidhart came to a stopgap agreement with management and was rehired.<ref name="OWOW"/> The belts were returned to the Harts, while the title change was never broadcast or even acknowledged on TV.<ref name=sm148/> When news spread, WWF explained that the original result was void due to a collapsed [[turnbuckle]] in the ring during the bout. A buckle had indeed broken, but not to a noticeable or dangerous extent during the match. The Rockers plodded along, eventually splitting on [[December 2]] [[1991]] during an incident on [[Edward Leslie|Brutus "The Barber" Beefcake's]] televised "Barber Shop" talk show segment.<ref name=sm159>Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.157–159)</ref> Michaels [[superkick]]ed Jannetty and [[Defenestration|threw him]] through a [[Sugar glass|glass]] window on the "shop" set.<ref name=stopper/> Jannetty vanished from the WWF and Michaels [[List of professional wrestling slang#T|turned]] [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] as "The Boy Toy".<ref name=sm159/>

====1992–1993====
At the suggestion of [[Curt Hennig|Curt "Mr. Perfect" Hennig]], Michaels' adopted the nickname "The Heartbreak Kid."<ref name=stopper/> Along with his new name came a new [[List of professional wrestling slang#G|gimmick]] as a vain, cocky heel. He was put together with mirror-carrying [[manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] [[Sherri Martel|"Sensational" Sherri]], who, according to the storyline, had become infatuated with him.<ref name=sm159/> Sherri even sang the first version of his new [[theme music]] "Sexy Boy."<ref name="HAT"/> During that period, Michaels normally wrestled during the first half of [[house shows]], and his departure was announced with the words "Shawn Michaels has left the building" (alluding to the phrase "[[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] has left the building").<ref>Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.165–166)</ref>

Michaels failed to win the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Championship]] from [[Bret Hart]] in July 1992, even losing the WWF's first ever [[Ladder match]] against him at a [[house show]].<ref>Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.161–162)</ref> Still, Michaels was beginning to [[List of professional wrestling slang#G|get over]] as a heel. He won the Intercontinental Championship from [[Davey Boy Smith|"The British Bulldog"]] during ''[[WWE Saturday Night's Main Event|Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' on [[October 27]] [[1992]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/snme.html#31|title=Saturday Night's Main Event - October 27, 1992 results|accessdate=2007-09-28|publisher=ProWrestlingHistory.com}}</ref> Shortly thereafter, he was in a pay-per-view main event for the first time, facing — and losing to — future nemesis Bret Hart, for the [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] at the [[Survivor Series (1992)|1992 Survivor Series]].<ref>{{cite news|title=2007 Wrestling Almanac & Book of Facts|work=Wrestling’s Historical Cards|publisher=Kappa Publishing|date=2007|pages=90-91}}</ref> They were moved to the main event after [[Warrior (wrestler)|The Ultimate Warrior]] suddenly departed from the WWF, leaving his tag team match with [[Randy Savage]] against [[Ric Flair]] and [[Scott Hall|Razor Ramon]] hanging.<ref>{{cite book|title=Wrestlecrap: The Very Worst of Pro Wrestling|last=Baer|first=Randy|coauthors=R.D. Reynolds|publisher=ECW Press|date=2003|isbn=1-55022-584-7|pages=74}}</ref>

During this time, Michaels and Sherri split and his former partner Jannetty quickly reappeared. Michaels lost the Intercontinental Championship to Jannetty on ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'' on [[May 17]] [[1993]].<ref name=1993results>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/1993.html|title=RAW 1993 Results|accessdate= 2007-07-23|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> He then regained it on June 6 with the help of his debuting "[[bodyguard]]" (and off-air friend) [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]].<ref name=1993results/>

After a feud with Mr. Perfect, Michaels quit the WWF in September 1993. It was announced that Michaels had failed to defend his belt enough times during a set period; in reality, he had been suspended for testing positive for [[steroid]]s — a charge that Michaels denies to this day.<ref>Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.182)</ref> After turning down [[World Championship Wrestling]]'s advances, Michaels returned to the WWF and made several appearances in the [[United States Wrestling Association]] during a WWF/USWA cross-promotion. He returned to WWF television for November's [[Survivor Series (1993)|Survivor Series]] pay-per-view, substituting for the arrested [[Jerry Lawler]] in a match pitting himself and three of Lawler's "Knights" against Bret, [[Bruce Hart (wrestler)|Bruce]], [[Keith Hart (wrestler)|Keith]], and [[Owen Hart]].<ref name=pwi92>{{cite news|title=2007 Wrestling Almanac & Book of Facts|work=Wrestling’s Historical Cards|publisher=Kappa Publishing|date=2007|pages=91-92}}</ref>

====1994–1995====
[[Image:Hug MSG Incident.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Clique (professional wrestling)#Curtain Call: The MSG Incident|The MSG Incident]].]]
He soon entered a feud with [[Scott Hall|Razor Ramon]], who had won the vacated [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Title]] during Michaels' absence.<ref name="ladderbegin">Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.182–187)</ref> Since Michaels had never been defeated in the ring for the title, he claimed to be the rightful champion and even carried around his old title belt.<ref name="ladderbegin"/> This feud culminated in a [[ladder match]] between the two at [[WrestleMania X]].<ref name="ladderbegin"/> Michaels lost the match, which featured both his and Ramon's belts suspended above a ladder in the ring.<ref name=pwi92/><ref name="ladderbegin"/> This match was voted by fans as "Match of the Year".<ref name=stopper/> Over the next few months, Michaels battled various injuries and launched the "Heartbreak Hotel" TV talk show segment, mainly shown on ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|WWF Superstars]]''.<ref>Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.190)</ref>

On [[August 28]] [[1994]], Michaels and [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]] captured the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF World Tag Team Championship]] from [[The Headshrinkers]].<ref>Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.195)</ref> During their brief time as a tag team, they used a variation of the Headshrinkers' finishing move, where Michaels finished off their opponent by climbing on Diesel's shoulders and [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Splash|splashed]] their opponents. The next day, at [[SummerSlam (1994)|SummerSlam]], Diesel lost the Intercontinental Title to Ramon when Michaels accidentally [[Superkick]]ed his bodyguard.<ref name=pwi92/> This triggered a Michaels-Diesel split, a storyline that was drawn out until the [[Survivor Series (1994)|Survivor Series]] that November due to Michaels' hand injury.<ref>{{cite news|title=2007 Wrestling Almanac & Book of Facts|work=Wrestling’s Historical Cards| publisher=Kappa Publishing|date=2007|pages=92-93}}</ref> Michaels went on to win the [[Royal Rumble (1995)|1995 Royal Rumble]], where he was the first participant to win the Rumble match from the No.1 spot.<ref name=WWEhistory/><ref name=sm196>Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.196–199)</ref> This set up a championship grudge match at [[WrestleMania XI]] against Diesel (who had gone on to win the [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] from [[Bob Backland]]).<ref name=sm196/> As part of the storyline, Michaels recruited [[Sid Eudy|Sid]] as his bodyguard for the build-up, lost the match,<ref>{{cite news|author=Martin, Finn|title=Power Slam Magazine, issue 10|work=Tough luck Shawn (WrestleMania XI)|publisher=SW Publishing|date=1995-04-24|pages=20-25}}</ref> and was attacked by Sid the following night.<ref name="Sid attack">Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.204)</ref> After this, Michaels took time off.<ref name="Sid attack"/>

He returned to the ring as a '[[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]]' in June 1995 and defeated [[Jeff Jarrett]] at July's [[In Your House#In Your House 2: The Lumberjacks|In Your House]] pay-per-view to win his third Intercontinental title.<ref name=stopper/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/iyh.html#2|title=In Your House 2: The Lumberjacks|accessdate=2007-12-28|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref><ref>Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.209)</ref> This led to a title defense against Razor Ramon at [[SummerSlam (1995)|SummerSlam]], in a Ladder match, which Michaels won.<ref name=stopper/> Around this time, Michaels became the alleged leader of a backstage group known as [[Clique (professional wrestling)|The Clique]].<ref name=stopper/> Others perceived the group to have sufficient clout with WWF owner [[Vince McMahon]], becoming dominant wrestling figures in WWF for several years in the mid-1990s. Michaels disputes the perception, saying that McMahon pushed only deserving wrestlers.<ref>Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.206-208)</ref> Michaels' fan base was later nicknamed "The Kliq" as an inside reference to the real "Clique."<ref>Michaels, Shawn.

The next month, during a match with [[Owen Hart]] on an episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'', Owen nailed Michaels with an [[Professional wrestling attacks#Enzuigiri|Enzuigiri]] kick to the back of Michaels' head.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1995/raw112095|title=Raw is War - November 20, 1995|accessdate=2008-03-30|date=1995-11-20|publisher=The Other Arena}}</ref><ref>Michaels, Shawn.

====1996–1997====
After teasing a retirement, Michaels returned to the WWF at the [[Royal Rumble (1996)|1996 Royal Rumble]] match, which he won for the second year in a row.<ref>{{cite news|title=2007 Wrestling Almanac & Book of Facts|work=Wrestling’s Historical Cards|publisher=Kappa Publishing|date=2007|pages=95}}</ref> Around this time, [[Jose Lothario]], Michaels' original trainer, became his on-screen manager.<ref>Michaels, Shawn.

In October, at [[WWE Bad Blood#1997|In Your House: Badd Blood]], Michaels and Undertaker participated in the very first [[Hell in a Cell]] match, which saw Michaels falling off the side of the {{convert|15|ft|m|0|sing=on}} high structure through a table.<ref name="HIAC1">Michaels, Shawn.

In the summer, Michaels joined forces with real-life friend, [[Triple H|Hunter Hearst Helmsley]] and Hunter's then-girlfriend, [[Chyna]] to form the [[Stable (professional wrestling)|stable]], [[D-Generation X]] (DX).<ref>Michaels, Shawn.

Michaels later claimed the flag desecration was Bret's idea.<ref>Michaels, Shawn.

'''Entrance music'''
*The song ''Sexy Boy'' was originally written for Michaels by [[Jimmy Hart]]. Hart thanked Michaels personally for continuing to use the song as his entrance music when he was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] in 2005. Michaels' entrance music was originally performed by [[Sherri Martel]] until she became a [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]],<ref name="HAT"/> and then the second version was performed by Michaels himself with traces of Sherri in the chorus portion of the song. The current version of the song in use today is the version Michaels sung himself.
*Since the return of [[D-Generation X]], Michaels mostly used the DX entrance ''Break It Down,'' by [[Chris Warren (musician)|The Chris Warren Band]], even when wrestling in singles competition, but then went back to using ''Sexy Boy''.

==Personal life==
Growing up, Hickenbottom was never called "Michael" because he hated the name, so his family and friends just called him "Shawn".<ref name=sm18>Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.18–19)</ref> Ever since, he has been referred to as Shawn. Additionally, Hickenbottom moved around frequently since his father was in the military. He relates in his autobiography how he dreaded the first day at his many new schools, when the teacher would call roll and announce his surname of "Hickenbottom" to the class, which would evoke giggles and teasing because of its unusual sound.<ref name=sm18/>

In 1996, Hickenbottom posed in a non-nude layout for ''[[Playgirl]]'' [[magazine]].<ref name="playgirl">Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.233)</ref> It was not until after he posed that he discovered that ''Playgirl'' has a mostly homosexual readership, which was seen as humorous by his fellow wrestlers.<ref name="playgirl"/>

Hickenbottom's marriage to his first wife, Theresa Lynn Wood, was brief and ended in divorce, but was amicably settled.<ref>Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.194)</ref> He is now married to former WCW [[Nitro Girls|Nitro Girl]], [[Rebecca Curci|Whisper (Rebecca Curci)]]. They were married on [[March 31]] [[1999]] at the Graceland Wedding Chapel in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].<ref>Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.296)</ref> It was a very small wedding ceremony. The only people present were Hickenbottom, Rebecca Curci, and an [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] impersonator. Hickenbottom and Curci have a son, Cameron Kade (born on [[January 5]] [[2000]])<ref>Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.304)</ref> and a daughter, Cheyenne Michelle (born on [[August 19]] [[2004]]).<ref>Michaels, Shawn. Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story (p.329)</ref>

Hickenbottom has several tattoos. He has a tattoo of a heart with a sword through it with a snake around it in the shape of an "S".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/raw/shawnmichaels/photos1/2007rawphotos/020507hbk2.jpg|title=An image of HBK|accessdate=2007-11-27|publisher=WWE}}</ref><ref name="HBK superstar ink">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/superstarink/articles/hbksuperstardomandsalvationinink|title=Shawn Michaels: Superstardom and salvation in ink|date=2008-03-13|last=Zeigler|first=Zack|accessdate=2008-03-14|publisher=WWE}}</ref> He has one on his wedding finger, that has an ''R'' for his wife Rebecca.<ref name="HBK superstar ink"/> Another in his left wrist, it's a bracelet design that says "Cameron" for his son.<ref name="HBK superstar ink"/> On his left leg he has a picture of his wife,<ref name="HBK superstar ink"/> the other leg has a picture of the state of Texas.<ref name="HBK superstar ink"/> Finally, he has a small broken heart with the letters "HBK" above it, tattooed on his right hip.<ref name="HBK superstar ink"/>

Hickenbottom is [[cross-dominance|ambidextrous]].<ref name=sm15/> This caused him problems as a boy playing football, as he had trouble differentiating between his right and left directions.<ref name=sm15/> He uses his right hand to draw and color and his left hand to write.<ref name=sm15/> He typically uses his right leg to deliver Sweet Chin Music.

Hickenbottom is a [[Born again Christianity|born again Christian]]. He was raised as a Roman Catholic, but became a non-denominational Christian under the influence of his wife Rebecca. His ring attire often incorporates cross symbols, and while on the way to the ring, he normally gets down on his knees and mouths a prayer while his pyrotechnics go off. He has been seen in the congregation during a televised service of [[Cornerstone Church]] in his hometown of San Antonio. Hickenbottom is a [[Bible]] teacher in San Antonio.<ref name="HAT"/> Hickenbottom also appeared on a [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]] program along with [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/s/shawn-michaels.html|title=Shawn Michael's Online World of Wrestling profile|accessdate=2007-09-02|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://tbn.org/index.php/9/4/2408.html|title=TBN search results|accessdate=2007-09-02|publisher=TBN.org}}</ref>

Hickenbottom is a fan of the [[San Antonio Spurs]]. He has been seen wearing Spurs merchandise and attending Spurs games. [[John Layfield|JBL]] made a reference to Hickenbottom being a season ticket holder during the [[Royal Rumble (2007)|2007 Royal Rumble]].<ref>{{cite video|year=2007|title=Royal Rumble 2007|medium=DVD|publisher=WWE Home Video}}</ref>
