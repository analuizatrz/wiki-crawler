'''Pasta''' ([[Italian language|Italian]] for "dough") is a generic term for [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] variants of [[noodles]].


There are approximately 350 different [[shapes of pasta]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lifeinitaly.com/food/pasta-history.asp |title=History of Pasta |accessdate=2008-04-06}}</ref> A few examples include [[spaghetti]] (solid, thin [[cylinders]]), [[maccheroni]] ([[Tubing (material)|tubes]] or hollow cylinders), [[fusilli]] (swirls), and [[lasagne]] (sheets).  Two other noodles, [[gnocchi]] and [[spätzle]], are sometimes counted as pasta because they are traditional in Italy. Pasta is categorized in two basic styles: ''Dried'' and ''Fresh''. Depending upon whether or not pasta includes eggs as an ingredient, the [[shelf life]] of pasta can be several years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/get_cooking/cooks_guide/pasta.shtml |title=BBC Food - Get cooking - Pasta |accessdate=2008-04-06}}</ref>. Pasta is [[boiled]] before consumption.

==Ingredients==
Pasta ingredients span a wide range. Most pastas are made from a combination of simple flour and water mixtures. Pre-packaged [[speciality]] pasta often includes spices and cheeses, while others include added coloring from [[spinach]], [[tomatoes]], and [[food dye]]. 

Under Italian law, dry pasta (''pasta secca'') can only be made from [[durum]] wheat or [[semolina]] flour. Durum flour has a yellow tinge in color. Italian pasta is traditionally cooked ''al dente'' (Italian: "to the tooth", meaning not too soft). Abroad, dry pasta is frequently made from other types of flour (such as [[farina]]), but this yields a softer product, which cannot be cooked ''al dente''.

Particular varieties of pasta may also use other grains and milling methods to make the flour. Some pasta varieties, such as [[Pizzoccheri]], are made from [[buckwheat]] flour. Various types of fresh pasta include [[egg (food)|eggs]] (''pasta all'uovo''). [[Gnocchi]] are often listed among pasta dishes, although they are quite different in ingredients (mainly milled [[potato]]es).

== History ==

Though the Chinese were eating [[noodles]] as long ago as 1500 [[Before Christ|BC]] (known thanks to the discovery of a well-preserved bowl of noodles over 4000 years old<ref>{{cite science | last = Lu | first = Houyuan | coauthors = ''et al.'' | date =13 October 2005 | title = Culinary archaeology: Millet noodles in Late Neolithic China | journal = Nature | volume = 437 | pages = 967–968 | doi =10.1038/437967a | news =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4335160.stm | abstract =http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v437/n7061/abs/437967a.html}}</ref>),  the familiar legend of [[Marco Polo]] importing pasta from [[China]] is just that—a legend<ref> [http://www.ilovepasta.org/faqs.html National Pasta Association] article ''FAQs'' section "Who "invented" pasta?"</ref>, whose origins lie not in Polo's ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo|Travels]]'', but was introduced by [[Arabs]] during their conquest of [[Sicily]] (newsletter of the [[National Pasta Association|National Macaroni Manufacturers Association]]).<ref>{{cite book | last = Serventi | first = Silvano | coauthors = Françoise Sabban | others = Trans. Antony Shugaar | title = Pasta: The Story of a Universal Food | year = 2002 | publisher = Columbia University Press | location = New York | id = ISBN 0231124422 | pages = 10}}</ref> 

The works of the 2nd century CE Greek physician [[Galen]] mention ''itrion'', homogeneous compounds made up of flour and water.<ref name=ss17>{{Harvcolnb|Serventi|Sabban|2002|p=17}}</ref> The [[Jerusalem Talmud]] records that ''itrium'', a kind of boiled dough,<ref name=ss17/> was common in Palestine from the 3rd to 5th centuries CE.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Serventi|Sabban|2002|p=29}}</ref> But these references are vague and simply speculate on a possible connection to modern pasta.

A dictionary compiled by the 9th century Syrian physician and lexicographer Isho bar Ali defines ''itriyya'' as string-like shapes made of semolina and dried before cooking, probable evidence of Arab influence on the ancestor to modern-day dried pasta. One form of ''itrion'' with a long history is ''laganum'' (plural ''lagana''), which in Latin refers to a thin sheet of dough.<ref name=ss15>{{Harvcolnb|Serventi|Sabban|2002|pp=15–16}}</ref> In the 1st century BC work of Horace, ''lagana'' were fine sheets of dough which were fried<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Serventi|Sabban|2002|p=24}}</ref> and were an everyday food.<ref name=ss15/> Writing in the 2nd century [[Athenaeus of Naucratis]] provides a recipe for ''lagana'' which he attributes to the 1st century Chrysippus of Tyana: sheets of dough made of wheat flour and the juice of crushed lettuce, then flavored with spices and deep-fried in oil.<ref name=ss15/> An early 5th century cookbook describes a dish called ''lagana'' that consisted of layers of dough with meat stuffing, a possible ancestor of modern-day ''[[Lasagna]]''.<ref name=ss15/> But the method of cooking these sheets of dough do not correspond to our definition of either a fresh or dry pasta product. The fact remains that the first concrete information concerning pasta products in Italy dates from the thirteenth or fourthteenth century.<ref>{{cite book | last = Serventi | first = Silvano | coauthors = Françoise Sabban | others = Trans. Antony Shugaar | title = Pasta: The Story of a Universal Food | year = 2002 | publisher = Columbia University Press | location = New York | id = ISBN 0231124422 | pages = 10}}</ref>  The question of their origin continues to evoke speculation.  The name (λαγάνα, ''lagána'') survives in modern-day [[Greece]] to denote an unleavened, flat bread eaten during the [[Great Lent]].

==Varieties of pasta==
Pasta comes in many different shapes and forms: from short to long, from straight to curly, from strip-shaped to nubbly.

In Italian supermarkets, pasta can be commonly bought in dozens of different shapes, and usually every pasta-dish requires the right shape of pasta.

Common [[List of pasta|varieties of pasta]] include: [[spaghetti]], [[macaroni]], [[lasagna]], [[tagliatelle]], [[vermicelli]] and [[ravioli]]<ref>[http://www.5hpk.com/Html/TOPIC/200804211.html The colume of pasta] from 5hpk.com(Chinese).</ref>

== Accompaniments ==
Common pasta sauces in [[Northern Italy]] include [[pesto]] and [[ragù alla bolognese]]; in [[Central Italy]], simple [[tomato sauce]], [[amatriciana]] and [[carbonara]], and in [[Southern Italy]], spicy tomato, garlic, and olive oil based sauces, often paired with fresh vegetables or seafood. Varieties include [[puttanesca]], ''pasta alla norma'' (tomatoes, eggplant and fresh or baked cheese), ''pasta con le sarde'' (fresh sardines, pine nuts, fennel and olive oil), ''spaghetti aglio, olio e peperoncino'' (literally with garlic, (olive) oil and hot chili peppers).

[[Fettuccine alfredo]], with butter and cheese, and spaghetti with tomato sauce with or without ground meat or meatballs are popular Italian-style dishes in the [[United States]].

As pasta is introduced elsewhere in the world, it has been incorporated into a number of local cuisines that may have significantly different ways of preparations from those of its country of origin.  In [[Hong Kong]], the local Chinese have adopted pasta, primarily [[spaghetti]] and [[macaroni]], as an ingredient in the [[Hong Kong-style Western cuisine]].  In the territory's [[Cha chaan teng]]s, pasta, most commonly macaroni, is cooked in water, and served in broth with [[ham]] or [[sausage|frankfurter sausages]], peas, [[shiitake|black mushrooms]], and optionally [[egg (food)|eggs]] reminiscent of [[noodle soup]] dishes. This is often a course for breakfast or light lunch fare <ref>AP, Explore the world of Canto-Western cuisine, January 8, 2007  http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16440507/</ref>.  The method often involves cooking the pasta well beyond the [[al dente]] stage and washing the starches off the pasta after cooking, measures frowned upon in Italy or in Hong Kong's more authentic Italian eateries.

==Misinformation==
One frequently reads, or hears on food shows that "''pasta'' is made from [[durum]] semolina" or "''pasta'' is made from [[semolina]] flour". Both of these statements are [[specious]] to some extent. It is impossible to make a pasta or dough from semolina. The granules will not stick together when water is added to it.  All semolina must first be ground into flour before it can be made into a dough, and all commercially produced flour, at this time in history, begins as semolina which is produced as part of the milling process. Therefore all commercial flour, of any color or wheat type, is ''''semolina flour'''' unless it is ground directly from the wheat kernel which is seldom the case. Before the introduction of modern milling methods however, the harder portion of the endosperm would resist the action of the millstones and this would be collected and was called ''semolina''. Having a higher gluten content than the softer parts of the endosperm, the flour made from it was ideal for making pasta because it maintains its integrity better when cooked in boiling water. This distinction is important to prevent confusion. <ref name=gisslen>Wayne Gisslen (2001), ''Professional Baking'', John Wiley & Sons</ref>
