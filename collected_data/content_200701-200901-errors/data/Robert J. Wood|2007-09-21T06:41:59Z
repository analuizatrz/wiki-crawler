==Early career==
Wood was born in [[Petersburg, Virginia]]. He attended [[Randolph-Macon College]] from 1925 until entering the [[United States Military Academy]] in 1926. Upon graduating on [[June 12]], [[1930]], he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the [[Coast Artillery Corps]].<ref name=biosketch>{{citation

Gruenther]], future [[Supreme Allied Commander Europe|NATO supreme commander]]. Following the war, he attended the [[National War College]] and served as a military aide to [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[James Forrestal]].<ref name=biosketch/> 

==NATO==
In 1951, Wood was assigned to the Advanced Planning Group charged with creating [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe]] (SHAPE), the NATO headquarters organization. The chief of the Advanced Planning Group was now-Lieutenant General Alfred Gruenther, who was still using Wood as his "personal dog robber", or staff troubleshooter, so Wood took the job of staff secretary as it seemed to them to be the best control point. "General Gruenther is an extremely able staff officer," Wood later observed. "I learned more about staff work in the 5th Army and SHAPE from him than I ever did at [[Fort Leavenworth|Leavenworth]] [Command and General Staff School]." <ref name=meyer>{{citation

As staff secretary, Wood dealt with a diverse set of issues ranging from critical tasks such as helping the planning group organize itself while concurrently working out the nature and organization of the command as a whole, developing the necessary infrastructure, and transitioning the previous planning groups into the actual command headquarters organization;<ref name=wood>{{citation

Following SHAPE's activation on [[April 2]], [[1951]], Wood continued to serve as secretary of the staff at SHAPE headquarters until May 1952, when he was promoted to brigadier general and assigned as Chief of the Defense Annual Review Team for the U.S. Mission to NATO and the European Regional Organization (USRO). In July 1953, he was assigned as deputy defense advisor to the [[United States Ambassador to NATO]] in [[Paris]], [[France]].<ref name=biosketch/><ref name=heaton/>

The Rogers Board's members included Major Generals [[Hamilton H. Howze]], Thomas F. Van Natta, [[Alva R. Fitch]], Richard D. Meyer, Ernest F. Easterbrook, and chairman Lieutenant General Gordon B.

The Director of Military Assistance supervised the operational details of arms transfer to NATO allies and other friendly countries, as guided by the [[United States Department of State|State Department]]. As chief of staff of the foreign military aid program, he was considered to be on the same level as the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|chiefs of staff of the Army]], [[Chief of Naval Operations|Navy]], and [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force|Air Force]] and of comparable military rank, but without a seat on the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]].<ref name=palmer>{{citation
