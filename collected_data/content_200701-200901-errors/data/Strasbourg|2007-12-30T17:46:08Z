'''Strasbourg''' ({{lang-fr|Strasbourg}}, {{pronounced|stʁasbuʁ}}; [[Alsatian language|Alsatian]]: ''Strossburi'', {{IPA|[ˈʃd̥ʁɔːsb̥uʁi]}}; {{lang-de|Straßburg}}<includeonly>DO NOT SPELL IT "STRASSBURG", FOR IT IS NOT PRONOUNCED THE SAME WAY : aß = long a, ass = short a. AND STOP BOLDENING.</includeonly> [[Archaism|archaic]]: ''Strassburg'') is the capital and principal [[city]] of the [[Alsace]] ''[[Regions of France|region]]'' in northeastern [[France]], with 702,412 inhabitants in the [[metropolitan area]] in [[2007]]. Located close to the border with [[Germany]], it is the ''[[Prefectures in France|préfecture]]'' (capital) of the [[Bas-Rhin]] ''[[Departments of France|département]]''. 

Strasbourg is the seat of several European institutions such as the [[Council of Europe]] with its [[European Court of Human Rights]], its [[European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines]] and its [[European Audiovisual Observatory]], the [[Eurocorps]] as well as the [[European Parliament]] and the [[European Ombudsman]] of the [[European Union]]. Strasbourg is an important center of manufacturing and engineering, as well as of road, rail, and river communications. The port of Strasbourg is the second largest on the [[Rhine]] after [[Duisburg]], [[Germany]]<ref>[http://www.strasbourg.port.fr/portenbref.htm Figures on the port's website]</ref>. The city is the seat of the [[Central Commission for Navigation on the Rhine]].

Strasbourg's historic center, the ''[[Grande Île, Strasbourg|Grande Île]]'' ("Grand Island"), was classified a [[World Heritage site]] by [[UNESCO]] in 1988, the first time such an honor was placed on an entire city center. Strasbourg is beautifully fused into the Franco-German culture ([[Alemannic]]), and is regarded as the bridge of unity between modern France and Germany.

Strasbourg is also a bridge for [[Germanic]] and [[Latin]] culture.

== Etymology ==
The city's [[Gallicization|Gallicized]] name is of [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] origin and means  "town (at the crossing) of roads". The modern ''Stras-'' is [[cognate]] to the [[German language|German]] ''Straße''/''Strasse'' which itself is derived from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''[[wikt:strata|strata]]'' ("[[street]]"), while ''-bourg'' is cognate to the German ''-[[burg]]'' ("fortress, town, citadel"), the [[English language|English]] ''[[borough]]'' and the French ''[[bourg]]'' ("village").

== Geography and climate ==
[[Image:Climatediagram-metric-english-Strasbourg-France-1961-1990.png|thumb|left|Climate diagram of Strasbourg]]
Strasbourg is situated on the [[Ill (France)|Ill River]], where it flows into the Rhine on the border with [[Germany]], across from the German town [[Kehl]]. The city is situated in the Rhine valley, approximately 20&nbsp;kilometers east of the [[Vosges Mountains]] and 25&nbsp;kilometers west of the [[Black Forest]]. Winds coming from either direction being often deflected by these natural barriers, the average annual pluviometry is low<ref>[http://meteo.msn.com/monthly_averages.aspx?wealocations=wc:FRXX0095 Annual rain in Strasbourg]</ref> and the perceived summer temperatures can be inordinately high. The defective natural ventilation also makes Strasbourg one of the most atmospherically polluted cities of France<ref>[http://www.atmo-alsace.net/ Daily measurements for Strasbourg and Alsace]</ref>{{,}}<ref>[http://ruedemetzeral.cigogne.org/index.php/2005/10/20/3761-pollution-a-strasbourg Measurements] made on [[October 18]] and [[October 19]], [[2005]]</ref>, although the progressive disappearance of heavy industry on both banks of the Rhine as well as effective measures of traffic regulation in and around the city are showing encouraging results.<ref>[http://www.epe.be/workbooks/tcui/example3.html OUTLINES OF THE URBAN TRANSPORTATION POLICY LEAD BY THE URBAN COMMUNITY OF STRASBOURG]</ref>.

At the site of Strasbourg, the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] established a military outpost and named it ''Argentoratum''. (Hence the town is commonly called ''Argentina'' in medieval Latin.<ref>[http://www.columbia.edu/acis/ets/Graesse/orblata.html Graesse, ''Orbis Latinus'']</ref>) It belonged to the ''[[Germania Superior]]'' [[Roman province]]. The name was first mentioned in the year [[12 BC]]; the city celebrated its 2,000th birthday of continuous settlement in [[1988]]. While the center of Argentoratum proper was situated on the [[Grande Île, Strasbourg|Grande Île]] ([[Cardo]] : current ''Rue du Dôme'', [[Decumanus]] : current ''Rue des Hallebardes'') most Roman artifacts have been found along the current ''Route des Romains'' in the suburb of [[Koenigshoffen]], on the road that lead to it.<ref>[http://www.strasbourg.fr/territoires/communes/oberschaeffolsheim/Plan_General.pdf?FileID=documentsprincipaux%2farcheo_koenigshoffen%2fplan_general.pdf Map of archological findings in Koenigshoffen]</ref> From the [[4th century]], Strasbourg was the seat of the [[Archbishopric of Strasbourg]]. 

The [[Alemanni]] fought a [[Battle of Argentoratum]] against Rome in [[357]]. They were defeated by [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]], later [[Roman Emperors|Emperor of Rome]], and their king [[Chonodomarius]] was taken prisoner. On [[January 2]], [[366]] the Alemanni crossed the frozen [[Rhine]] in large numbers, to invade the Roman Empire. Early in the [[5th century]] the Alemanni appear to have crossed the Rhine, conquered, and then settled what is today Alsace and a large part of [[Switzerland]]. 

The town was occupied successively in the 5th century by Alemanni, [[Huns]], and [[Franks]]. In the 9th century it was commonly known as ''Strazburg'' in the local language, as documented in [[842]] by the [[Oaths of Strasbourg]]. This trilingual text is considered to contain, besides Latin and [[Old High German]], also the oldest written variety of [[Gallo-Romance]] clearly distinct from Latin, the ancestor of [[Old French]]. The town was also called ''Stratisburgum'' or ''Strateburgus'' in Latin, ''Strossburi'' in Alsatian and ''Straßburg'' in Standard German, and then ''Strasbourg'' by the French. 

A major commercial center, the town came under control of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in [[923]], through the homage paid by the [[Duke of Lorraine]] to German King [[Henry I of Germany|Henry I]]. The early history of Strasbourg consists of a long conflict between its [[Archbishopric of Strasbourg|bishop]] and its citizens. The citizens emerged victorious after the [[Battle of Oberhausbergen]] in [[1262]], when King [[Philip of Swabia]] granted the city the status of an [[Imperial Free City]].

Around 1200, [[Gottfried von Straßburg]] wrote the [[Middle High German]] courtly romance Tristan, which is regarded, alongside Wolfram von Eschenbach's Parzival and the [[Nibelungenlied]], as one of great narrative masterpieces of the German Middle Ages.

A revolution in [[1332]] resulted in a broad-based city government with participation of the [[guild]]s, and Strasbourg declared itself a free [[republic]]. The murderous [[bubonic plague]] of [[1348]] was followed on [[February 14]], [[1349]] by one of the first and worst [[pogrom]]s in pre-modern history: several hundred [[Jew]]s were publicly burnt to death and the rest of them expelled of the city.<ref>[http://judaisme.sdv.fr/histoire/historiq/stval/stval.htm The "Valentine's day massacre" of 1349]</ref> Until the end of the 18th century, Jews were forbidden to remain in town after 10 pm. The time to leave the city was signaled by a municipal [[herald]] blowing the ''[[Horn (instrument)|Grüselhorn]]'' (see below, "Museums", ''Musée historique'')<ref>[http://judaisme.sdv.fr/histoire/villes/strasbrg/hist/hist2.htm The Jews of Strasbourg and the Great Plague]</ref>; a high-pitched [[church bell|Cathedral bell]] still rings today. A special tax, the ''Pflastergeld'' ("pavement money") was furthermore to be paid for any horse that a Jew would ride or bring into the city while allowed to<ref>[http://judaisme.sdv.fr/histoire/villes/strasbrg/hist/hist3.htm The Jews of Strasbourg until the French Revolution]</ref>.

[[Image:Strasbourg1493.png|thumb|350px|left|View of the city and the [[Strasbourg Cathedral]] from [[1493]].]]
			
[[Strasbourg Cathedral]] which began undergoing construction in the 12th century, was completed in [[1439]] (though only the north tower was built) and became the [[World's Tallest Building]], surpassing the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]]. In the [[1520s]] during the [[Protestant Reformation]], the city embraced the religious teachings of [[Martin Luther]], whose adherents established a [[University of Strasbourg|university]] (the Gymnasium, headed by [[Johannes Sturm]]) in the following century. The city first followed the [[Tetrapolitan Confession]], and then the [[Augsburg Confession]]. [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[iconoclasm]] caused much destruction to churches and cloisters. Strasbourg was a center of humanist scholarship and early book-printing in the Holy Roman Empire and its intellectual and political influence contributed much to the establishment of Protestantism as an accepted denomination in the southwest of Germany. Together with four other free cities, Strasbourg presented the ''confessio tetrapolitana'' as its Protestant book of faith at the Imperial [[Diet of Augsburg]] in 1530, where the slightly different [[Augsburg Confession]] was also handed over to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]].

After the reform of the Imperial constitution in the early 16th century and the establishment of "[[Imperial Circle]]s", Strasbourg was part of the "[[Upper Rhenish Circle]]", a corporation of Imperial estates in the southwest of [[Holy Roman Empire]], mainly responsible for maintaining troops, supervising coining, and ensuring public security.

After the invention of the printing press by [[Johannes Gutenberg]] around 1440, who had moved from [[Mainz]] to Strasbourg, the first modern newspaper was published in Strasbourg in 1605, when [[Johann Carolus]] received the permission by the City of Strasbourg to print and distribute a weekly journal written in German by reporters from several central European cities.

=== From Thirty Years' War to First World War ===
The Free City of Strasbourg remained neutral during the [[Thirty Years' War]]. In September [[1681]] it was seized by King [[Louis XIV of France]], whose unprovoked annexation was recognized by the [[Treaty of Ryswick]] ([[1697]]). The official policy of religious intolerance which drove many [[Protestantism|Protestants]] from France after the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] ([[1598]]) by the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]] ([[1685]]) was not applied in Strasbourg and in Alsace. Strasbourg Cathedral, however, was handed over from the [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] to the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholics]]. The German Lutheran university persisted until the [[French Revolution]]. Famous students were [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] and [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]].

During a dinner in Strasbourg organized by Mayor Frédéric de Dietrich on [[April 25]], [[1792]], [[Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle]] composed "[[La Marseillaise]]". However, Strasbourg's status as a free city was revoked by the [[French Revolution]]. Fanatical [[Jacobin Club|Jacobins]] (most notoriously [[Eulogius Schneider]]) ruled the city with an iron hand before being overthrown after the downfall of [[Maximilien Robespierre]]. During their reign, many churches and cloisters were either destroyed or severely damaged. The cathedral lost hundreds of its statues (later replaced by copies in the 19th century) and in 1794, there was talk of tearing its spire down, on the grounds that it hurt the principle of equality. The tower was saved, however, when citizens of Strasbourg proposed to crown it with a giant [[phrygian cap]].<ref>[http://www.inlibroveritas.net/lire/oeuvre6886-chapitre28829.html Strasbourg Cathedral and the French Revolution (1789-1802)]</ref>

[[Image:Karte Strassburg MK1888.png|thumb|300px|[[1888]] German map of Strasbourg in [[1888]] as part of the [[German Empire]].]]
With the growth of industry and commerce, the city's population tripled in the [[19th century]] to 150,000. During the [[Franco-Prussian War]] and the [[Siege of Strasbourg]], the city was heavily bombarded by the [[Prussian army]]. On [[August 24]], [[1870]], the Museum of Fine Arts was destroyed by fire, as was the Municipal Library housed in the Gothic former Dominican Church, with its unique collection of medieval manuscripts (most famously the [[Hortus deliciarum]]), rare Renaissance books and Roman artifacts. In [[1871]] after the war's end, the city was annexed to the newly-established [[German Empire]] as part of the [[Alsace-Lorraine|Reichsland Elsaß-Lothringen]] (via the [[Treaty of Frankfurt (1871)|Treaty of Frankfurt]]) without a [[plebiscite]]. As part of Imperial Germany, Strasbourg was rebuilt and developed on a grand and representative scale (the ''Neue Stadt'', or "new city") and included a new museum and a new library. The ''[[University of Strasbourg]]'', founded in 1567 and suppressed during the French Revolution as a stronghold of German sentiment, was reopened in 1872. A belt of massive [[fortification]]s was established around the city, most of which still stand today : ''Fort Roon'' (now ''Desaix'') and ''Podbielski'' (now ''Ducrot'') in [[Mundolsheim]], ''Fort von Moltke'' (now ''Rapp'') in [[Reichstett]], ''Fort Bismarck'' (now ''Kléber'') in [[Wolfisheim]], ''Fort Kronprinz'' (now ''Foch'') in [[Niederhausbergen]], and ''Fort Grossherzog von Baden'' (now ''Frère'') in [[Oberhausbergen]].<ref>[http://www.witzgilles.com/plan_ceinture_Strasbourg2.htm Partial plan]</ref> Those forts subsequently served the French army, and were used as POW-camps in 1918 and 1945.

Following the defeat of Germany in [[World War I]], the city was restored to France; city residents were again not offered a plebiscite.

=== Twentieth century and now ===
[[Image:060611 006.jpg|thumb|right|A lost, then restored, symbol of modernity in Strasbourg : a room in the Aubette building designed by [[Theo van Doesburg]], [[Hans Arp]] and [[Sophie Taeuber-Arp]]]]
Having been influenced by Germanic culture since the [[Franks|Frankish]] [[Frankish Realm|Realm]], Strasbourg remained largely Alsatian-speaking well into the [[20th century]], and Germany continued to covet it under [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] rule. Following the [[Fall of France]] in [[1940]] during [[World War II]], the city was annexed by [[Nazi Germany]]. As one of the first official acts, the new rulers burnt and razed the main [[synagogue]] that had been a major architectural landmark and one of the largest in Europe since its completion in [[1897]].<ref>[http://judaisme.sdv.fr/histoire/villes/strasbrg/synago/kleber.htm History and pictures of the Synagogue du Quai Kléber]</ref> After the war, Strasbourg was returned to France, and while the First World War did not notably damage the city, Anglo-American bombers caused extensive destruction in [[1944]] in raids of which at least one was allegedly carried out by mistake.<ref>[http://clio.coleumes.org/pdf/memoire-p2004-des_civils_en_premiere_ligne.pdf "Civilians on the frontline ? Allied aerial bombings in northeastern France, 1940-1945"]</ref> On [[November 22]], [[1944]], the city was officially liberated by [[General]] [[Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque|Leclerc]], although he entered the city the next day; a major street now commemorates the day of liberation.<ref>[http://www.witzgilles.com/strasbourg_23_novembre_1944.htm#strasbourg%20bombardement Pictures of Strasbourg in ruins after the 1944 bombing raids]</ref> An unrelated tragedy that added, however, to the wartime losses, was the [[1947]] fire that destroyed a valuable part of the collection of the new ''Museum of Fine Arts''. 

In [[1920]], Strasbourg became the seat of the [[Central Commission for Navigation on the Rhine]], previously located in [[Mannheim]], one of the very first European institutions. In [[1949]], the city was chosen to be the seat of the [[Council of Europe]] with its [[European Court of Human Rights]] and [[European Pharmacopoeia]]. Since [[1952]], Strasbourg has been the official seat of the [[European Parliament]], although only plenary sessions are held in Strasbourg each month, while all other business is being conducted in [[Brussels and the European Union|Brussels]] and [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]]. Those sessions take place in the ''[[Seat of the European Parliament in Strasbourg#Louise Weiss|Immeuble Louise Weiss]]'', inaugurated in [[1999]], which houses the largest parliamentary assembly room in Europe and of any democratic institution in the world. Before that, the EP sessions had to take place in the main [[Council of Europe]] building, the [[Palace of Europe]], whose unusual inner architecture had become a familiar sight to European TV audiences.<ref>http://www.ena.lu?lang=1&doc=5141 View of the assembly room]</ref> In [[1992]], Strasbourg became the seat of the Franco-German TV channel and movie-production society [[Arte]].

In [[2000]], an [[Strasbourg cathedral bombing plot|Islamist plot to blow up the cathedral]] was prevented by German authorities. On [[July 6]], [[2001]], during an open-air concert in the ''Parc de Pourtalès'', a single falling [[Platanus]] caused one of the worst disasters of its kind in history, killing thirteen people and injuring 97. On March 27, 2007, the city was found guilty of neglect over the accident and fined € 150.000<ref>[http://news.monstersandcritics.com/europe/news/article_1283405.php City of Strasbourg fined in storm death]</ref>

In [[2006]], after a long and careful restoration, the inner decoration of the ''Aubette'', made in the 1920s by [[Hans Arp]], [[Theo van Doesburg]], and [[Sophie Taeuber-Arp]] and destroyed in the 1930s, was made accessible to the public again. The work of the three artists had been called "the [[Sistine Chapel]] of [[abstract art]]".<ref>[http://www.batiactu.com/data/13042006/13042006-111343.html Reopening of the restored rooms]</ref>

=== Architecture ===
[[Image:Notre dame de strasbourg 2.jpg|thumb|175px|right|[[Strasbourg Cathedral|Strasbourg, Cathedral of Our Lady]].]]

The city is chiefly known for its [[sandstone]] [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[Strasbourg Cathedral|Cathedral]] with its famous [[Strasbourg astronomical clock|astronomical clock]], and for its medieval cityscape of [[Rhineland]] black and white timber-framed buildings, particularly in the ''[[Petite-France]]'' district alongside the Ill and in the streets and squares surrounding the cathedral, where the renowned ''[[Maison Kammerzell]]'' stands out. 

*Notable distinctly medieval streets: ''Rue Mercière'', ''Rue des Dentelles'', ''Rue du Bain aux Plantes'', ''Rue des Juifs'', ''Rue des Frères'', ''Rue des Tonneliers'', ''Rue du Maroquin'', ''Rue des Charpentiers'', ''Rue des Serruriers'', ''Grand' Rue'', ''Quai des Bateliers'', ''Quai Saint-Nicolas'', ''Quai Saint-Thomas''..
*Notable distinctly medieval squares: ''Place de la Cathédrale'', ''Place du Marché Gayot'', ''Place Saint-Etienne'', ''Place du Marché aux Cochons de Lait'', ''Place Benjamin Zix''...

[[Image:Absolute Pl marche aux cochons 01.JPG|thumb|left|''Place du Marché aux Cochons de Lait'']]
[[Image:Absolute Maison des tanneurs 01.JPG|thumb|left|''Maison des tanneurs'']]

In addition to the cathedral, Strasbourg houses several other medieval churches that have survived the many wars and destructions that have plagued the city: the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] ''Église Saint-Etienne'', partly destroyed in 1944 by Anglo-American bombing raids, the part Romanesque, part Gothic, very large ''[[Saint-Thomas church (Strasbourg)|Église Saint-Thomas]]'' with its [[Gottfried Silbermann|Silbermann]] organ on which [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] and [[Albert Schweitzer]] played <ref>[http://perso.wanadoo.fr/eisenberg/orgues/stthomas.htm History and description of the instrument]</ref>, the Gothic ''Eglise Saint-Pierre-le-Jeune Protestant'' with its crypt dating back to the 5th century and its [[cloister]] partly from the 11th century, the Gothic ''Église Saint-Guillaume'' with its fine early-Renaissance stained glass and furniture, the Gothic ''Église Saint-Jean'' etc.
The [[Neo-gothic architecture|Neo-Gothic]] church ''Saint-Pierre-le-Vieux Catholique'' (there is also an adjacent church ''Saint-Pierre-le-Vieux Protestant'') serves as a shrine for several 15th-century wood worked and painted [[Altar#Altars in Christian churches|altars]] coming from other, now destroyed churches and installed there for public display.
Among the numerous secular medieval buildings, the monumental ''Ancienne Douane'' (old custom-house) stands out.

The [[German Renaissance]] has bequeathed the city some noteworthy buildings (especially the current ''Chambre de Commerce et d'Industrie'', former [[City and town halls|town hall]], on ''Place Gutenberg''), as did the [[French Baroque and Classicism]] with several ''hôtels particuliers'' (i.e. [[palace]]s), among which the ''[[Palais Rohan, Strasbourg|Palais Rohan]]'' (now housing three museums) is the most spectacular. Other buildings of its kind are the ''Hôtel du Préfet'', the ''Hôtel des Deux-Ponts'' and the city-hall ''Hôtel de Ville'' etc. The largest baroque building of Strasbourg though is the 1720s main building of the ''Hôpital civil''.
As for French [[Neo-classicism]], it is the Opera House on Place Broglie that most prestigiously represents this style. 

Strasbourg also offers high-class [[Eclecticism in art|eclecticist]] buildings in its very extended German district, being the main memory of [[William I, German Emperor|Wilhelmian architecture]] since most of the major cities in Germany proper suffered intensive damages during World War II. Streets, boulevards and avenues are homogeneous, surprisingly high (up to seven stories) and broad examples of German urban lay-out and of this architectural style that summons and mixes up five centuries of European architecture as well as Neo-Egyptian, Neo-Greek and Neo-Babylonian styles. The former imperial palace ''[[Palais du Rhin]]'', the most political and thus heavily criticized of all German Strasbourg buildings epitomizes the grand scale and stylistic sturdiness of this period. But the two most handsome and ornate buildings of these times are the ''École internationale des Pontonniers'' (the former ''Höhere Mädchenschule'', girls college) with its towers, turrets and multiple round and square angles <ref>[http://www.archi-strasbourg.org/index.php?page=detaildossier&modephoto=grand&ident=1027 Pictures]</ref> and the ''École des Arts décoratifs'' with its lavishly ornate facade of painted bricks, woodwork and [[majolica]] <ref>[http://www.archi-strasbourg.org/index.php?page=detaildossier&modephoto=grand&ident=733 Views]</ref>.

[[Image:OrgueSaintThomasStrasbourg.jpg|thumb|left|The baroque organ of [[Saint-Thomas church (Strasbourg)|Saint-Thomas church]]]]

*Notable streets of the German district include: ''Avenue de la Forêt Noire'', ''Avenue des Vosges'', ''Avenue d'Alsace'', ''Avenue de la Marseillaise'', ''Avenue de la Liberté'', ''Boulevard de la Victoire'', ''Rue Sellénick'', ''Rue du Général de Castelnau'', ''Rue du Maréchal Foch'', and ''Rue du Maréchal Joffre''
*Notable squares of the German district include: ''Place de la République'', ''Place de l'Université'', ''Place Brant'', and ''Place Arnold'' 

Impressive examples of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] military architecture of the 1880s can be found along the newly reopened ''Rue du Rempart'', displaying large scale fortifications among which the aptly named ''Kriegstor'' (war gate).

As for modern and contemporary architecture, Strasbourg possesses some fine [[Art Nouveau]] buildings (the huge ''Palais des Fêtes'', some houses and villas on ''Avenue de la Robertsau'' and ''Rue Sleidan''), good examples of post-[[World War II]] functional architecture (the ''Cité Rotterdam'', for which [[Le Corbusier]] did not succeed in the architectural contest) and, in the very extended ''Quartier Européen'', some spectacular administrative buildings of sometimes utterly large size, among which the [[European Court of Human Rights]] by [[Richard Rogers]] is arguably the finest. Other noticeable contemporary buildings are the new [[Music school]] ''Cité de la Musique et de la Danse'', the ''[[Musée d'art moderne et contemporain of Strasbourg|Musée d'Art moderne et contemporain]]'' and the ''Hôtel du Département'' facing it, as well as, in the outskirts, the tramway-station [[Hoenheim]]-Nord designed by [[Zaha Hadid]].

The city is also home to beautiful bridges, among which the medieval ''Ponts Couverts'' with its four towers is the most spectacular.

[[Image:Place Kleber.jpg|thumb|right|''Place Kléber'']]

Next to it is a part of the 17th-century [[Vauban]] fortifications, the ''[[Barrage Vauban]]''. Other nice bridges are the ornate 19th-century ''Pont de la Fonderie'' (1893, stone) and ''Pont d'Auvergne'' (1892, iron), as well as architect [[Marc Mimram]]'s futuristic ''Passerelle'' over the Rhine, opened in 2004.

The largest square at the center of the city of Strasbourg is the [[Place Kléber]]. Located in the heart of the city’s commercial area, it was named after general [[Jean-Baptiste Kléber]], born in Strasbourg in [[1753]] and slaughtered in [[1800]] in [[Cairo]]. In the square is a statue of Kléber, under which is a vault containing his remains. On the north side of the square is the [[Aubette]] (Orderly Room), built by [[Jacques François Blondel]], architect of the king, in [[1765]]-[[1772]].

=== Parks ===

[[Image:Absolute Chateau de Pourtales 01.JPG|thumb|The ''Château de Pourtalès'' (front side) in the park of the same name]]

Strasbourg features a number of prominent [[park]]s, of which several are of cultural and historical interest: the ''Parc de l'Orangerie'', laid out as a French garden by [[André le Nôtre]] and remodeled as an English garden on behalf of [[Joséphine de Beauharnais]], now displaying noteworthy French gardens, a neo-classical castle and a small [[zoo]]; the ''Parc de la Citadelle'', built around impressive remains of the 17th-century [[fortress]] erected close to the [[Rhine]] by [[Vauban]] <ref>[http://www.archi-strasbourg.org/index.php?page=detaildossier&modephoto=grand&ident=1349 Pictures]</ref>; the ''Parc de Pourtalès'', laid out in English style around a [[baroque]] castle (heavily restored in the 19th century) that now houses the [[Schiller International University]], and featuring an open-air museum of international contemporary sculpture <ref>[http://www.ceaac.org/html/espace_public/pourtales/frame.htm Overview]</ref>. 
The ''Jardin Botanique'' (botanical garden) was created under the German administration next to the [[Observatory of Strasbourg]], built in [[1881]], and still owns some [[greenhouse]]s of those times. The ''Parc des Contades'', although the oldest park of the city, was completely remodeled after World War II. The futuristic ''Parc des Poteries'' is an example of European park-conception in the late 1990s. The ''Jardin des deux Rives'', spread over Strasbourg and [[Kehl]] on both sides of the Rhine, is the most recent ([[2004]]) and most extended (60 [[hectare]]) park of the agglomeration.

== Education ==
=== Universities and schools ===
Strasbourg, which was a [[humanism]] centre, has a long history of higher-education excellence, merging French and German intellectual traditions. Although Strasbourg had been annexed by the Kingdom of France in 1683, it still remained connected to the German-speaking intellectual world throughout the 18th century and the university attracted numerous students from the [[Holy Roman Empire]], including [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Metternich]] and [[Maximilian von Montgelas|Montgelas]], who studied law in Strasbourg, among the most prominent. Nowadays, Strasbourg is known to offer among the best university courses in France, after Paris.

There are three [[University of Strasbourg|universities in Strasbourg]], with an approximate total of 48,500 students as of 2007 (another 4,500 students are being taught at one of the diverse post-graduate schools)<ref>[http://www.universites-formations-alsace.fr/index.php?langue=1 Figures]</ref>:

* Strasbourg I - [[Louis Pasteur University]]
* Strasbourg II - [[Marc Bloch University]]
* Strasbourg III - [[Robert Schuman University]]

The prestigious [[Institut d'études politiques de Strasbourg]] is part of Robert Schuman University.

The campus of the [[École nationale d'administration]] (ENA) is located in Strasbourg (the former one being in [[Paris]]). The location of the "new" ENA - which trains most of the nation's high-ranking civil servants - was meant to give a European vocation to the school.

The [[École supérieure des Arts décoratifs ]] (ESAD) is an art school of Europe-wide reputation. 

The permanent campus of the [[International Space University]] (ISU) is located in the south of Strasbourg ([[Illkirch-Graffenstaden]])

Other important schools include the INSA ([[Institut national des sciences appliquées]]), the INET ([[Institut national des études territoriales]]), the ENGEES ([[École nationale du génie de l'eau et de l'environnement de Strasbourg]]), and the CUEJ ([[Centre universitaire d'enseignement du journalisme]]).

=== Libraries ===
[[Image:Absolute Bibliotheque nationale 01.jpg|thumb|right|Lateral view of the National Library]]
The [[Bibliothèque nationale et universitaire de Strasbourg]] (BNUS) is, with its collection of more than 3,000,000 titles <ref>[http://www.bnu.fr/BNU/FR/A+propos/ Figures]</ref>, the second largest library in France after the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]. It was founded by the German administration after the complete destruction of the previous municipal library in 1871 and holds the unique status of being simultaneously a student's and a national library.

The municipal library ''Bibliothèque municipale de Strasbourg'' (BMS) administrates a network of ten medium-sized librairies around the different part of the town. A six story high ''Grande bibliothèque'' is currently being built in former port areas close to the center and is scheduled to open mid-2008. Among the cities of the Communauté urbaine, most have their own library, Illkirch-Graffenstaden's being the largest and most modern as of 2007.

== Transport ==
[[Image:Tramway Strasbourg FRA 001.jpg|thumb|The tramway]]
Strasbourg has its [[Strasbourg Airport|own airport]], serving a limited number of destinations. Train services operate eastward to [[Offenburg]] and [[Karlsruhe]] in [[Germany]], westward to [[Metz]] and [[Paris]], and southward to [[Basel]]. Since [[June 10]], [[2007]], Strasbourg is linked to the European high-speed train network by the [[LGV Est|TGV ''Est'']] ([[Paris]]-Strasbourg). The [[LGV Rhin-Rhône|TGV ''Rhin-Rhône'']] (Strasbourg-[[Lyon]]) is currently under construction and due to open in [[2012]].

City transportation in Strasbourg is served by a modern-looking [[Tramways in Strasbourg|tram system]] that has been operated since [[1994]] by the regional transit company [[Compagnie des transports strasbourgeois]]. A former tram system, partly following a different route, had been operating since [[1878]] but was ultimately dismantled in [[1960]].

Being a city next to the [[Rhine]] and along some of its most important canals ([[Marne-Rhine Canal]], [[Grand Canal d'Alsace]]), while crossed by the [[Ill (France)|Ill]], Strasbourg has always been an important center of fluvial navigation, as is attested by archeological findings as well as the important activity of the ''Port autonome de Strasbourg''. Water tourism inside the city proper attracts several 100,000 tourists yearly.

== European role ==
Strasbourg is one of three capitals of the [[European Union]].  It is the legislative and democratic capital, while [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]] is the judiciary and financial capital, and [[Brussels]] the executive and administrative capital. 

Strasbourg is: 
*since 1920 the seat of the [[Central Commission for Navigation on the Rhine]].
*since 1949 the seat of the [[Council of Europe]] with its [[European Court of Human Rights]], [[Commissioner for Human Rights]], [[European Pharmacopoeia]], [[European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines]], [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] and [[Congress of the Council of Europe]].
*since 1979 the seat of the [[European Parliament]] of the [[European Union]] and the only place where the whole parliament regularly meets.  
*the seat of the [[European Ombudsman]] of the [[European Union]].

Strasbourg also houses the [[Eurocorps]] headquarters as well as (since 1992) the Franco-German television channel [[Arte]].

France and Germany are creating a [[Eurodistrict]] straddling the Rhine, combining the Greater Strasbourg and the [[Ortenaukreis|Ortenau]] district of [[Baden-Württemberg]], with some common administration. The combined population of this district is 868,000 as of 2006. <ref>[http://www.eurodistrict.eu/fr/index.php?page=donnees&menu=menu5 Figures on the Eurodistrict's website]</ref>

== Sports ==
Internationally-renowned teams from Strasbourg are the "[[RC Strasbourg|Racing Club]]" ([[football (soccer)|football]]), the "[[Strasbourg IG|SIG]]" ([[basketball]]) and the "[[Étoile noire]]" ([[hockey]])<ref>http://www.etoile-noire.org/</ref>.
