The '''[[flag]] of the [[United States|United States of America]]''' consists of 13 equal horizontal stripes of [[red]] (top and bottom) alternating with [[white]], with a [[blue]] rectangle in the [[Flag terminology|canton]] bearing 50 small, white, [[Star (symbol)|five-pointed star]]s arranged in nine offset horizontal rows of six stars (top and bottom) alternating with rows of five stars. The 50 stars on the flag represent the [[U.S. state|50 U.S. states]] and the 13 stripes represent the original [[Thirteen Colonies]] that rebelled against the [[British monarchy|British Crown]] and became the first states in the Union.<ref>States are represented collectively; there is no meaning to particular stars nor stripes.</ref> Nicknames for the flag include the '''stars and stripes''', '''Old Glory''',<ref>Coined by Captain [[William Driver]], a nineteenth century shipmaster.</ref> the '''American flag''', and the '''star-spangled banner''' (also the name of the country's [[The Star-Spangled Banner|official national anthem]]).

Because of its symbolism, the starred blue canton is called the "union". This part of the national flag can stand alone as a [[maritime flag]] called the '''[[Jack of the United States|Union Jack]]'''.<ref>No relation to the [[Union Flag|Union Flag of the United Kingdom]] to which this term more commonly refers.</ref>

== Symbolism ==
The  flag of the United States is one of the nation's widely recognized and used symbols. Within the U.S. it is frequently displayed, not only on public buildings, but on private residences, as well as iconically in forms such as decals for car windows, and clothing ornaments such as badges and lapel pins. Throughout the world it is used in public discourse to refer to the U.S., both as a nation state, government, and set of policies, but also as an ideology and set of ideas.

Many understand the flag to represent the freedoms and rights guaranteed in the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] and its [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] and perhaps most of all to be a symbol of individual and personal liberty as set forth in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. The flag is a complex and contentious symbol, around which emotions run high.

Apart from the numbers of stars and stripes representing the number of current and original states, respectively, and the union with its stars representing a [[constellation]], there is no legally defined symbolism to the colors and shapes on the flag.  However, folk theories and traditions abound; for example, that the stripes refer to rays of sunlight and that the stars refer to the heavens, the highest place that a person could aim to reach.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.usflag.org/colors.html| title=What do the colors of the Flag mean?| work=USFlag.org: A website dedicated to the Flag of the United States of America| accessdate=June 14| accessyear=2005}}</ref>
Tradition holds that [[George Washington]] proclaimed:
"We take the stars from Heaven, the red from our [[Kingdom of Great Britain|mother country]], separating it by white stripes, thus showing that we have separated from her, and the white stripes shall go down to posterity representing Liberty."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www1.va.gov/opa/feature/celebrate/Flag.asp| title=The United States Flag - Public and Intergovernmental Affairs| work=United States Department of Veterans Affairs| accessdate=December 7| accessyear=2006}}</ref>

== Design ==
===Specification===
[[Image:Flag of the United States specification.svg|400px|right|Diagram of the flag's design]]

The basic design of the current flag is specified by {{usc|4|1}}; {{usc|4|2}} outlines the addition of new stars to represent new states.
The [[:Image:Flag of the United States specification.jpg|specification]] gives the following values:

* Hoist (width) of the flag: A = 1.0
* Fly (length) of the flag: B = 1.9<ref>Note that the flag ratio (B/A in the diagram) is not absolutely fixed. Although the diagram in Executive Order 10834 gives a ratio of 1.9, earlier in the order is a list of flag sizes authorized for executive agencies. This list permits eleven specific flag sizes (specified by height and width) for such agencies: 20.00 × 38.00; 10.00 × 19.00; 8.95 × 17.00; 7.00 × 11.00; 5.00 × 9.50; 4.33 × 5.50; 3.50 × 6.65; 3.00 × 4.00; 3.00 × 5.70; 2.37 × 4.50; and 1.32 × 2.50. Eight of these sizes conform to the 1.9 ratio, within a small rounding error (less than 0.01). However, three of the authorized sizes vary significantly: 1.57 (for 7.00 × 11.00), 1.27 (for 4.33 × 5.50) and 1.33 (for 3.00 × 4.00).</ref>
* Hoist (width) of the Union: C = 0.5385 (A x 7/13, spanning seven stripes)
* Fly (length) of the Union: D = 0.76 (B × 2/5, two fifths of the flag length)
* E = F = 0.0538 (C/10, One tenth the height of the field of stars)
* G = H = 0.0633 (D/12, One twelfth the width of the field of stars)
* Diameter of star: K = 0.0616
* Width of stripe: L = 0.0769 (A/13, One thirteenth of the flag width)

===Colors===
The exact shades of red, white, and blue to be used in the flag are specified as follows:<ref>According to [[Flags of the World]], the colors are specified by the [[General Services Administration]] "Federal Specification, Flag, National, United States of America and Flag, [[Jack of the United States|Union Jack]]," DDD-F-416E, dated [[November 27]], [[1981]].

===The 49- and 50-star unions===
When [[Alaska]] and [[Hawaii]] were being considered for statehood in the 1950s, more than 1,500 designs were spontaneously submitted to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. Although some of them were 49-star versions, the vast majority were 50-star proposals. At least three, and probably more, of these designs were identical to the present design of the 50-star flag.<ref>These designs are in the [[Eisenhower Presidential Center|Eisenhower Presidential Archives]] in [[Abilene, Kansas|Abilene]], [[Kansas]]. Only a small fraction of them have ever been published.</ref>  At the time, credit was given by the [[Executive Department]] to the [[United States Army Institute of Heraldry]] for the design.

Of these proposals, one created by 18-year old [[Robert G. Heft]] in 1958 as a school project has received the most publicity.  His mother was a seamstress, but refused to do any of the work for him. He originally received a B- for the project. After discussing the grade with his teacher, it was agreed (somewhat jokingly) that if the flag was accepted by Congress, the grade would be reconsidered. Heft's flag design was chosen and adopted by presidential proclamation after Alaska and before Hawaii was admitted into the union in 1959. He got an A.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.usflag.org/flagdesigner.html| title=Robert G. Heft: Designer of America's Current National Flag| work=USFlag.org: A website dedicated to the Flag of the United States of America| accessmonthday=December 7 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

===Decoration===
Traditionally, the flag may be decorated with [[Gold (color)|golden]] [[fringe (trim)|fringe]] surrounding the perimeter of the flag as long as it does not deface the flag proper. Ceremonial displays of the flag, such as those in [[parade]]s or on indoor posts, often use fringe to enhance the beauty of the flag. The first recorded use of fringe on a flag dates from 1835, and the [[United States Army|Army]] used it officially in 1895. No specific law governs the legality of fringe, but a 1925 opinion of the [[United States Attorney General|attorney general]] addresses the use of fringe (and the number of stars) "...is at the discretion of the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy..." as quoted from footnote in previous volumes of [[Title 4 of the United States Code]] law books and is a source for claims that such a flag is a military ensign not civilian.  However, according to the Army Institute of Heraldry, which has official custody of the flag designs and makes any change ordered, there are no implications of symbolism in the use of fringe.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/FAQ/FringeOnAmFlg.htm| title=Fringe on the American Flag| accessmonthday=June 27 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>  Several federal courts have upheld this conclusion.<ref>See McCann v. Greenway, 542 F.Supp. 647 (U.S. Dist. Ct. W.D. MO, 1997) which discusses various court opinions denying any significance related to trim used on a flag.</ref>

== Display and use==

[[Image:Americanflags.jpg|left|thumb|Flags on display on the [[National Mall]].]]

The flag is customarily flown year-round at most public buildings, and it is not unusual to find private houses flying full-size flags.
Some private use is year-round, but becomes widespread on civic holidays like [[Memorial Day]], [[Veterans Day]], [[Presidents' Day (United States)|Presidents' Day]], [[Flag Day in the United States|Flag Day]], and on [[Independence Day (US)|Independence Day]]. On Memorial Day it is common to place small flags by war memorials and next to the graves of U.S. war veterans.

===Flag etiquette===
{{main|United States Flag Code}}
The [[United States Flag Code]] outlines certain guidelines for the use, display, and disposal of the flag. For example, the flag should never be dipped to any person or thing, unless it is the [[ensign]] responding to a salute from a ship of a foreign nation. (This tradition comes from the [[1908 Summer Olympics]] in [[London]], where countries were asked to dip their flag to [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]]: the American team captain [[Martin Sheridan]] refused, famously proclaiming that "this flag dips to no earthly king."<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2005/06/24/olympics_history_feature.shtml London Olympics 1908 & 1948]</ref>). The flag should never be allowed to touch the ground and, if flown at night, must be illuminated. If the edges become tattered through wear, the flag should be repaired or replaced. When a flag is so tattered that can no longer serve as a symbol of the United States, it should be destroyed in a dignified manner, preferably by burning. The American Legion and other organizations regularly conduct dignified flag-burning ceremonies, often on Flag Day, [[June 14]].  It is a common myth that if a flag touches the ground or a flag that is soiled must be burned as well.  While a flag that is currently touching the ground and a soiled flag are unfit for display, neither situation is permanent and thus the flag does not need to be burned if the unfit situation is remedied. <ref>[http://www.snopes.com/holidays/flagday/burnflag.asp Snopes.com: Flag Disposal] retrieved 14 June 2008</ref>

Although the Flag Code is U.S. Federal law, there is no penalty for failure to comply with the Flag Code and it is not widely enforced—indeed, punitive enforcement would conflict with the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right to [[freedom of speech]]. Passage of the proposed [[Flag Desecration Amendment]] would overrule legal precedent that has been established in this area.

===Places of continuous display===

[[Image:Apollo 14 Shepard.jpg|right|thumb|Astronaut [[Alan Shepard]] raises the United States Flag on the surface of the [[moon]] during the [[Apollo 14]] mission.]]

===Particular days for display===
The flag should especially be displayed at full staff on the following days:

*January: [[January 1|1]] ([[New Year's Day]]) and [[January 20|20]] (Inauguration Day)
*February: [[February 12|12]] ([[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]]'s birthday) and the third Monday ([[Presidents' Day]], originally [[George Washington|Washington]]'s birthday)
*May: Third Saturday (Armed Forces Day) and last Monday ([[Memorial Day]]; half-staff until noon)
*June: [[June 14|14]] (Flag Day)
*July: [[July 4|4]] (Independence Day)
*September: First Monday ([[Labor Day]]), [[September 11|11]] ([[Patriot Day]]), and [[September 17|17]] ([[United States Constitution|Constitution]] Day)
*October: Second Monday ([[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] Day) and [[October 27|27]] (Navy Day)
*November: [[November 11]] (Veterans Day) and fourth Thursday ([[Thanksgiving Day]])
*and such other days as may be proclaimed by the [[President of the United States]]; the birthdays of states (date of admission); and on state holidays.

===Display at half staff===
The flag is displayed at half staff as a sign of respect or mourning. Nationwide, this action is proclaimed by the president; state-wide or territory-wide, the proclamation is made by the governor. In addition, there is no prohibition against municipal governments, private businesses or citizens flying the flag at half staff as a local sign of respect and mourning. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] issued the first proclamation on [[March 1]], [[1954]] standardizing the dates and time periods for flying the flag at half staff from all federal buildings, grounds, and naval vessels; other congressional resolutions and presidential proclamations ensued. However, they are only guidelines to all other entities: typically followed at state and local government facilities, and encouraged of private businesses and citizens.

To properly fly the flag at half staff, the protocol is to first hoist it briskly to full staff, then reverently (slowly) lower it to half staff. Similarly, when the flag is to be lowered from half staff, it should be first hoisted briskly to full staff, then lowered reverently to the base of the flagpole.

Federal guidelines state the flag should be flown at half staff at the following dates/times:
*[[May 15]] - [[Peace Officers Memorial Day]]
*Last Monday in May - [[Memorial Day]] (until noon)
*[[July 27]] - Korean War Veterans Day
*[[9/11|September 11]] - [[Patriot Day]]<ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/09/20050909-12.html Patriot Day, 2005<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
*[[December 7]] - Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day
*For 30 days - Death of a president or former president
*For 10 days - Death of a vice president, Supreme Court chief justice/retired chief justice, or speaker of the House of Representatives.
*From death until the day of interment - Supreme Court associate justice, member of the Cabinet, former vice president, president ''pro-tempore'' of the Senate, or the majority and minority leaders of the Senate and House of Representatives. Also for federal facilities within a state or territory, for the governor.
*On the day after the death - Senators, members of Congress, territorial delegates or the resident commissioner of the commonwealth of Puerto Rico

===Folding for storage===
[[Image:fold-us-flag-animated.gif|thumb|frame|right|Folding the U.S. flag]]
Though not part of the official Flag Code, according to military custom flags should be folded into a triangular shape when not in use.  (The [[Philippines]], a [[Overseas expansion of the United States|former American territory]], also has this custom for folding its flag.)  To properly fold the flag:

#Begin by holding it waist-high with another person so that its surface is parallel to the ground.
#Fold the lower half of the stripe section lengthwise over the field of stars, holding the bottom and top edges securely.
#Fold the flag again lengthwise with the blue field on the outside.
#Make a rectangular fold then a triangular fold by bringing the striped corner of the folded edge to meet the open top edge of the flag. Starting the fold from the left side over to the right
#Turn the outer end point inward, parallel to the open edge, to form a second triangle.
#The triangular folding is continued until the entire length of the flag is folded in this manner (usually thirteen triangular folds, as shown at right). On the final fold, any remnant that does not neatly fold into a triangle (or in the case of exactly even folds, the last triangle) is tucked into the previous fold.
#When the flag is completely folded, only a triangular blue field of stars should be visible.

== History ==
{{seealso|Timeline of the Flag of the United States}}
The flag has been changed 26 times since the new, 13-state union adopted it. The 48-star version went unchanged for 47 years, the longest time the flag went unmodified until [[July 4]], [[2007]], when the current 50-star flag broke the record.

=== First flag ===
{{flag image|Image = Grand Union Flag.svg|Caption = [[Image:FIAV historical.svg|23x15px]] Grand Union Flag ("Continental Colors").}}
{{flag image|Image = Flag of the British East India Company (1707).svg|Caption = [[Image:FIAV historical.svg|23x15px]] Flag of the British East India Company, 1707&ndash;1801}}
At the time of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, [[July 4]], [[1776]], the United States had no official national flag. The [[Grand Union Flag]] has historically been referred to as the "First National Flag"; although it has never had any official status, it was used throughout the [[American Revolutionary War]] by [[George Washington]] and formed the basis for the design of the first official U.S. flag.  The origins of the design are unclear. It closely resembles the [[British East India Company]] (BEIC) flag of the same era, and an argument dating to Sir [[Charles Fawcett]] in 1937 holds that the BEIC flag indeed inspired the design.<ref>{{FOTW|id=gb-eic2|title=The STRIPED FLAG of the EAST INDIA COMPANY, and its CONNEXION with the AMERICAN "STARS and STRIPES"}}</ref>  However, the BEIC flag could have from 9 to 13 stripes, and was not allowed to be flown outside the Indian Ocean.<ref>{{FOTW|id=gb-eic|title=East India Company (United Kingdom)}}</ref>  Both flags could have been easily constructed by adding white stripes to a British [[Red Ensign]], a common flag throughout Britain and its colonies.
[[Image:COA George Washington.svg|94x111px|left|thumb|[[Coat of arms of George Washington]].]]
Another theory holds that the red-and-white stripe—and later, stars-and-stripes—motif of the flag may have been based on the Washington family [[coat of arms|coat-of-arms]], which consisted of a shield "''argent'', two ''bars gules'', above, three ''mullets gules''" (a white shield with two red bars below three red stars).<ref>A 2002 [[BBC]] documentary featuring the town of [[Selby]] and [[Selby Abbey]] showed the coat of arms with the comentator refering to it as the inspiration for the U.S. Flag, a commonly held belief in Britain.</ref> 

More likely it was based on a flag of the [[Sons of Liberty]], one of which consisted of 13 red and white alternating horizontal stripes.

=== The Flag Resolution of 1777 ===
{{flag image|Image = US flag 13 stars – Betsy Ross.svg|Caption = [[Image:FIAV historical.svg|23x15px]] 13-star "Betsy Ross" flag}}
On [[June 14]], [[1777]], the Marine Committee of the [[Continental Congress#The Second Continental Congress|Second Continental Congress]] passed the Flag Resolution which stated: "Resolved, That the flag of the United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new Constellation."<ref name="fcic">[http://www.pueblo.gsa.gov/cic_text/misc/ourflag/history1.htm Federal Citizen Information Center: The History of the Stars and Stripes]. Accessed [[7 June]] [[2008]].</ref>  [[Flag Day in the United States|Flag Day]] is now observed on June 14 of each year. A false tradition holds that the new flag was first hoisted in June 1777 by the [[Continental Army]] at the [[Middlebrook encampment]].<ref>Guenter (1990)</ref>  

The 1777 resolution was probably meant to define a [[naval ensign]], rather than a national flag.  It appears between other resolutions from the Marine Committee.  On [[10 May]] [[1779]] Secretary of the Board of War [[Richard Peters, Jr.]] expressed concern "it is not yet settled what is the Standard of the United States."<ref>Mastai, 60</ref>

The Flag Resolution did not specify any particular arrangement, number of points, nor orientation for the stars. The pictured flag shows thirteen outwardly-oriented five-pointed stars arranged in a circle, the so-called [[Betsy Ross flag]]. Although the Betsy Ross legend is not taken seriously by many historians, the design itself is the oldest version of any U.S. flag to appear on any physical relic{{Fact|date=October 2007}}, since it is historically referenced in contemporary battlefield paintings by John Trumbull and Charles Willson Peale, which depict the circular star arrangement. Popular designs at the time were varied and most were individually crafted rather than mass-produced. Other examples of 13-star arrangements can be found on the [[Francis Hopkinson#Flag controversy|Francis Hopkinson flag]], the [[Cowpens flag]], and the [[Brandywine flag]]. Given the scant archaeological and written evidence, it is unknown which design was the most popular at that time.

{{flag image|Image = Guilford Courthouse Flag.svg|Caption = [[Guilford Courthouse flag|Guilford Court House Flag]]}}
Despite the 1777 resolution, a number of flags only loosely based on the prescribed design were used in the early years of American independence. One example may have been the [[Guilford Courthouse flag|Guilford Court House Flag]], traditionally believed to have been carried by the American troops at the [[Battle of Guilford Court House]] in 1781.<ref>Other evidence suggests it dates only to the nineteenth century. The original flag is at the North Carolina Historical Museum.</ref>

The origin of the stars and stripes design cannot be fully documented. A popular story credits [[Betsy Ross]] for sewing the first flag from a pencil sketch by George Washington who personally commissioned her for the job. However, no evidence for this theory exists beyond Ross' descendants' much later recollections of what she told her family. Another woman, Rebecca Young, has also been credited as having made the first flag by later generations of her family. Rebecca Young's daughter was Mary Pickersgill, who made the [[Star Spangled Banner Flag]]. 

It is likely that [[Francis Hopkinson]] of [[New Jersey]], a signer of the [[Declaration of Independence]], designed the 1777 flag while he was the Chairman of the Continental Navy Board's Middle Department, sometime between his appointment to that position in November 1776 and the time that the flag resolution was adopted in June 1777. This contradicts the Betsy Ross legend, which suggests that she sewed the first Stars and Stripes flag by request of the government in the Spring of 1776.<ref name="fcic"/><ref>Embassy of the United States of America [http://stockholm.usembassy.gov/usflag/hopkinson.html] Accessed [[11 April]] [[2008]].</ref> Hopkinson was the only person to have made such a claim during his own lifetime, when he sent a bill to Congress for his work. He asked for a "Quarter Cask of the Public Wine" as payment initially. The payment was not made, however, because it was determined he had already received a salary as a member of Congress, and he was not the only person to have contributed to the design. It should be noted that no one else contested his claim at the time.

{{see also|Flag Acts (U.S.)}}
In 1795, the number of stars and stripes was increased from 13 to 15 (to reflect the entry of Vermont and Kentucky as states of the union). For a time the flag was not changed when subsequent states were admitted, probably because it was thought that this would cause too much clutter. It was the 15-star, 15-stripe flag that inspired [[Francis Scott Key]] to write "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]," now the [[national anthem]].  

On [[April 4]], [[1818]], a plan was passed by Congress at the suggestion of U.S. Naval Captain Samuel C. Reid<ref>{{cite book| author=United States Government| title=Our Flag| publisher=United States Government Printing Office| location=Washington DC| year=1861| format=PDF| id=S.

The act specified that new flag designs should become official on the first [[July 4]] ([[Independence Day (US)|Independence Day]]) following admission of one or more new states. The most recent change, from 49 stars to 50, occurred in 1960 when the present design was chosen, after [[Hawaii]] gained statehood in August 1959. Before that, the admission of [[Alaska]] in January 1959 prompted the debut of a short-lived 49-star flag.

As of [[July 4]], [[2007]], the 50-star flag has become the longest rendition in use.



=== Historical progression of designs ===
{{Seealso|List of U.S. states by date of statehood}}
In the following table depicting the 28 various designs of the United States flag, the star patterns for the flags are merely the ''usual'' patterns, often associated with the [[United States Navy]]. Canton designs, prior to the proclamation of the 48-star flag by President [[William Howard Taft]] on [[29 October]] [[1912]], had no official arrangement of the stars. Furthermore, the exact ''colors'' of the flag were not standardized until 1934.<ref>(For alternate versions of the flag of the United States, see the [http://www.fotw.net/flags/us-ststr.html Stars of the U.S. Flag page] at the [[Flags of the World]] website.)

== Future of the flag ==
{{seealso|51st state}}

The [[United States Army Institute of Heraldry]] has plans for flags with up to 56 stars, using a similar staggered star arrangement should additional states accede. There are political movements supporting statehood in [[Political status of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]] and [[D.C. statehood movement|the District of Columbia]], among [[List of U.S. state secession proposals|other areas]].

The [[flag of Liberia]] bears a close resemblance, showing the ex-American-slave origin of the country. The Liberian flag has similar red and white stripes, though only 11 of them, as well as a blue square for the union, but with only a single large white star.

The [[flag of Malaysia]] also has a striking resemblance, with red and white stripes (14 total), and a blue canton, but displaying instead of stars a [[star and crescent]] emblem. This might be due, however, to the great influence of the [[British East India Company]], rather than the later United States flag

The [[flag of Hawaii]], in use since it was a kingdom in the 19th century, with eight stripes in red, white, and blue, and the [[Union Flag|British Union Flag]] in the canton, has some resemblance to the U.S. Grand Union Flag of the 18th century.
